After uploading the loader of this malware to Intezer\nAnalyze™, we have found a possible connection through code reuse to the loader of\n[another campaign of malware, Mole previously discovered by Unit 42 of Palo Alto](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-mole-ransomware-one-malicious-spam-campaign-quickly-increased-complexity-changed-tactics/)\nNetworks.\n\nThis connection might be an indicator that these two attacks are originated from the same\nthreat actor, but currently it is too early to tell.\n\n\n-----\n\n[(Intezer Analyze™ public report available here.)](https://www.intezer.com//intezer-analyze/)\n\nSilence Loader:\nf24b160e9e9d02b8e31524b8a0b30e7cdc66dd085e24e4c58240e4c4b6ec0ac2\n\nMole Loader: 50117ce3fe5dba572cf23584dc7541a7cfd4026d4316e69d29cdf536873fdf20\n\nIf we look at the code of the two loaders used by both campaigns side by side, we can see\nthat the code is very similar and according to our system is unique to these families of\nmalware.\n\n\n-----\n\n(sub_4079A0 vs sub_4023A0)\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough the disassembly in the photo above, we can also see there is a string initialized\nthrough an array, “RtpEncodePointer,” that is later used for a call to GetProcAddress. This\nlooks like a typo and the author of the code meant to write “RtlEncodePointer” because\n“RtpEncodePointer” does not exist in ntdll.dll. The evidence suggests that this code was\nbeing reused. There are no references to “RtpEncodePointer” available publicly online\n[besides automated reports of a couple unclassified malware from Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/1a8fc5c94009fd570a20397a05aaf53fc3e16c9d14d59a824ec16f663950219e?environmentId=100)\n\nIn addition to the links within the code, there are several other similarities we have\nwitnessed between the Mole and Silence malware, such as the attack vectors (spear\nphishing, packaging of the malware) and motives — which can be extra evidence for this\nconnection.\n\nYet again, we see that identifying code reuse can be very valuable in detecting new\nmalware, and in some cases for attribution purposes. We invite you to read more of the\n[posts in our blog and to request an](https://www.intezer.com//blog/) [invite to the community edition of our product.](https://intezer.viewpage.co/free-community-edition)\n\n[Follow @jaytezer for more updates.](https://twitter.com/jaytezer)\n\n**Jay Rosenberg**\n\n\n-----",
