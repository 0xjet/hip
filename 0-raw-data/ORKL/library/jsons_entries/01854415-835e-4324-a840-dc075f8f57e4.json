The result will hopefully serve as useful reference to policymakers, China\nspecialists, and information operations professionals. The research for this project\nencompassed five broad categories to show how the People’s Republic of China\n(PRC) is pursuing computer network operations (CNO) and the extent to which it is\nbeing implemented by examining:\n\na) The PLA‘s strategy for computer network operations at the campaign and\nstrategic level to understand how China is integrating this capability into overall\nplanning efforts and operationalizing it among its field units;\n\nb) Who are the principal institutional and individual “actors” in Chinese CNO and\nwhat linkages may exist between the civilian and military operators;\n\nc) Possible targets of Chinese CNO against the US during a conflict to\nunderstand how the PLA might attempt to seize information control over the\nUS or similar technologically advanced military during a conflict;\n\nd) The characteristics of ongoing network exploitation activities targeting the US\nGovernment and private sector that are frequently attributed to China;\n\ne) A timeline of alleged Chinese intrusions into US government and industry\nnetworks to provide broader context for these activities.\n\nThe basis for this work was a close review of authoritative open source PLA writings,\ninterviews with Western PLA and information warfare analysts, reviews of Western\nscholarship on these subjects, and forensic analysis of intrusions into US networks\nassessed to have Chinese origins. The research draws heavily from journals and\narticles published by the Chinese National Defense University and the Academy of\nMilitary Sciences, the military’s highest authority for issues of doctrine, strategy, and\nforce modernization. Many of these publications offer substantive insights into\ncurrent thinking on strategy and doctrinal issues related to information warfare and\nCNO. Additional insights into the role of information warfare in broader campaign\ndoctrine and strategy came from The Science of Military Strategy, _The Science of_\n_Campaigns, two of the most authoritative sources on the subject available in the open_\npress. The military’s official newspaper, The PLA Daily, and a range of Chinese\nmilitary journals, official media, provincial and local media as well as non-PRC\nregional media, all provided data on information warfare (IW) training events.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nTechnical assessments of operational tradecraft observed in intrusions attributed to\nChina are the result of extensive forensic analysis and discussions with information\nsecurity professionals who follow these issues closely. A review of Chinese technical\njournal articles on computer network attack and exploitation techniques also aided\nthis study. This research was obtained from online Chinese databases accessible in\nthe US.\n\nA regular review of the contents and discussions posted on Chinese hacker Websites\ncontributed to the analysis of these groups’ activities and capabilities. The focus of\nthis effort was to identify possible interactions between members of these groups and\nthe government. Conversations with Western information security analysts who\nclosely follow these groups and actors contributed immensely to focusing the\nresearch and greatly aided our understanding of China’s hacker communities.\n\nThis study was not scoped to include research in China, consequently, the authors\nfocused on the materials and insights presently available outside of China. Additional\nin-country research on this subject is an avenue of future effort that can—and\nshould—supplement the work presented here.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is a decade into a\nsweeping military modernization program that has fundamentally transformed its\nability to fight high tech wars. The Chinese military, using increasingly networked\nforces capable of communicating across service arms and among all echelons of\ncommand, is pushing beyond its traditional missions focused on Taiwan and toward a\nmore regional defense posture. This modernization effort, known as\ninformationization, is guided by the doctrine of fighting “Local War Under\nInformationized Conditions,” which refers to the PLA’s ongoing effort to develop a\nfully networked architecture capable of coordinating military operations on land, in air,\nat sea, in space and across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThis doctrinal focus is providing the impetus for the development of an advanced IW\ncapability, the stated goal of which is to establish control of an adversary’s\ninformation flow and maintain dominance in the battlespace. Increasingly, Chinese\nmilitary strategists have come to view information dominance as the precursor for\noverall success in a conflict. The growing importance of IW to China’s People’s\nLiberation Army (PLA) is also driving it to develop more comprehensive computer\nnetwork exploitation (CNE) techniques to support strategic intelligence collection\nobjectives and to lay the foundation for success in potential future conflicts.\n\nOne of the chief strategies driving the process of informatization in the PLA is the\ncoordinated use of CNO, electronic warfare (EW), and kinetic strikes designed to\nstrike an enemy’s networked information systems, creating “blind spots” that various\nPLA forces could exploit at predetermined times or as the tactical situation warranted.\nAttacks on vital targets such as an adversary’s intelligence, surveillance, and\nreconnaissance (ISR) systems will be largely the responsibility of EW and\ncounterspace forces with an array of increasingly sophisticated jamming systems and\nanti-satellite (ASAT) weapons.  Attacks on an adversary’s data and networks will\nlikely be the responsibility of dedicated computer network attack and exploitation\nunits.\n\nThe Chinese have adopted a formal IW strategy called “Integrated Network Electronic\nWarfare” (INEW) that consolidates the offensive mission for both computer network\nattack (CNA) and EW under PLA General Staff Department’s (GSD) 4[th] Department\n(Electronic Countermeasures)[1] while the computer network defense (CND) and\n\n1 The General Staff Department is the highest organizational authority in the PLA responsible for the\ndaily administrative duties of the military. It is comprised of seven functional departments: operations,\nintelligence, signals intelligence, electronic countermeasures, communications, mobilization, foreign\nrelations, and management.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nintelligence gathering responsibilities likely belong to the GSD 3[rd] Department\n(Signals Intelligence), and possibly a variety of the PLA’s specialized IW militia units.\n\nThis strategy, which relies on a simultaneous application of electronic warfare and\ncomputer network operations against an adversary’s command, control,\ncommunications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR)\nnetworks and other essential information systems, appears to be the foundation for\nChinese offensive IW. Analysis of this strategy suggests that CNO tools will be\nwidely employed in the earliest phases of a conflict, and possibly preemptively\nagainst an enemy’s information systems and C4ISR systems.\n\nThe PLA is training and equipping its force to use a variety of IW tools for intelligence\ngathering and to establish information dominance over its adversaries during a\nconflict. PLA campaign doctrine identifies the early establishment of information\ndominance over an enemy as one of the highest operational priorities in a conflict;\nINEW appears designed to support this objective.\n\nThe PLA is reaching out across a wide swath of Chinese civilian sector to meet the\nintensive personnel requirements necessary to support its burgeoning IW capabilities,\nincorporating people with specialized skills from commercial industry, academia, and\npossibly select elements of China’s hacker community. Little evidence exists in open\nsources to establish firm ties between the PLA and China’s hacker community,\nhowever, research did uncover limited cases of apparent collaboration between more\nelite individual hackers and the PRC’s civilian security services. The caveat to this is\nthat amplifying details are extremely limited and these relationships are difficult to\ncorroborate.\n\nChina is likely using its maturing computer network exploitation capability to support\nintelligence collection against the US Government and industry by conducting a long\nterm, sophisticated, computer network exploitation campaign. The problem is\ncharacterized by disciplined, standardized operations, sophisticated techniques,\naccess to high-end software development resources, a deep knowledge of the\ntargeted networks, and an ability to sustain activities inside targeted networks,\nsometimes over a period of months.\n\nAnalysis of these intrusions is yielding increasing evidence that the intruders are\nturning to Chinese “black hat” programmers (i.e. individuals who support illegal\nhacking activities) for customized tools that exploit vulnerabilities in software that\nvendors have not yet discovered. This type of attack is known as a “zero day exploit”\n(or “0-day”) as the defenders haven't yet started counting the days since the release\nof vulnerability information. Although these relationships do not prove any\ngovernment affiliation, it suggests that the individuals participating in ongoing\npenetrations of US networks have Chinese language skills and have well established\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nties with the Chinese underground hacker community. Alternately, it may imply that\nthe individuals targeting US networks have access to a well resourced infrastructure\nthat is able to broker these relationships with the Chinese blackhat hacker community\nand provide tool development support often while an operation is underway.\n\nThe depth of resources necessary to sustain the scope of computer network\nexploitation targeting the US and many countries around the world coupled with the\nextremely focused targeting of defense engineering data, US military operational\ninformation, and China-related policy information is beyond the capabilities or profile\nof virtually all organized cybercriminal enterprises and is difficult at best without some\ntype of state-sponsorship.\n\nThe type of information often targeted for exfiltration has no inherent monetary value\nto cybercriminals like credit card numbers or bank account information. If the stolen\ninformation is being brokered to interested countries by a third party, the activity can\nstill technically be considered “state-sponsored,” regardless of the affiliation of the\nactual operators at the keyboard.\n\nThe US information targeted to date could potentially benefit a nation-state defense\nindustry, space program, selected civilian high technology industries, foreign\npolicymakers interested in US leadership thinking on key China issues, and foreign\nmilitary planners building an intelligence picture of US defense networks, logistics,\nand related military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis. The breadth of\ntargets and range of potential “customers” of this data suggests the existence of a\ncollection management infrastructure or other oversight to effectively control the\nrange of activities underway, sometimes nearly simultaneously.\n\nIn a conflict with the US, China will likely use its CNO capabilities to attack select\nnodes on the military’s Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET)\nand unclassified DoD and civilian contractor logistics networks in the continental US\n(CONUS) and allied countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The stated goal in targeting\nthese systems is to delay US deployments and impact combat effectiveness of troops\nalready in theater.\n\nNo authoritative PLA open source document identifies the specific criteria for\nemploying computer network attack against an adversary or what types of CNO\nactions PRC leaders believe constitutes an act of war.\n\nUltimately, the only distinction between computer network exploitation and attack is\nthe intent of the operator at the keyboard: The skill sets needed to penetrate a\nnetwork for intelligence gathering purposes in peacetime are the same skills\nnecessary to penetrate that network for offensive action during wartime. The\ndifference is what the operator at that keyboard does with (or to) the information once\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\ninside the targeted network. If Chinese operators are, indeed, responsible for even\nsome of the current exploitation efforts targeting US Government and commercial\nnetworks, then they may have already demonstrated that they possess a mature and\noperationally proficient CNO capability.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n## Chinese Computer Network Operations Strategy\n\n**_The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is actively developing a capability_**\n**_for computer network operations (CNO) and is creating the strategic guidance,_**\n**_tools and trained personnel necessary to employ it in support of traditional_**\n**_warfighting disciplines. Nonetheless, the PLA has not openly published a CNO_**\nstrategy with the formal vetting of the Central Military Commission (CMC), China's top\nmilitary decisionmaking body, or the Academy of Military Sciences (AMS), its leading\nbody for doctrine and strategy development . The PLA has however, developed a\nstrategy called “Integrated Network Electronic Warfare” that is guiding the\nemployment of CNO and related information warfare tools. The strategy is\ncharacterized by the combined employment of network warfare tools and electronic\nwarfare weapons against an adversary’s information systems in the early phases of a\nconflict.\n\nChinese information warfare strategy is closely aligned with the PLA’s doctrine for\nfighting Local Wars Under Informationized Conditions, the current doctrine that seeks\nto develop a fully networked architecture capable of coordinating military operations\non land, in air, at sea, in space and across the electromagnetic spectrum. China’s\nmilitary has shifted from a reliance on massed armies of the Maoist Era People’s War\ndoctrine and is becoming a fully mechanized force linked by advanced C4ISR\ntechnologies.\n\nInformationization is essentially a hybrid development process, continuing the trend\nof mechanization and retaining much of the current force structure while overlaying\nadvanced information systems on it to create a fully networked command and control\n(C2) infrastructure.[2] The concept allows the PLA to network its existing force\nstructure without radically revising current acquisition strategies or order of battle.\n\n  - PLA assessments of current and future conflicts note that campaigns will be\nconducted in all domains simultaneously—ground, air, sea, and\nelectromagnetic—but it is the focus of the latter domain in particular that has\ndriven the PLA’s adoption of the Informationized Conditions doctrine.[3]\n\n2 _China's National Defense in 2008, Information Office of the State Council of the People's_\nRepublic of China, Beijing, 29 December 2008. http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/200901/20/content_74133294.htm\n3 _China's National Defense in 2004, Information Office of the State Council of the People's_\nRepublic of China, Beijing, 27 December 2004, available at:\nhttp://english.peopledaily.com.cn/whitepaper/defense2004/defense2004.html | China's\n_National Defense in 2006, Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of_\nChina, Beijing, 29 December 2006, available at http://english.chinamil.com.cn/site2/newschannels/2006-12/29/content_691844.htm\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nThis doctrine is also influencing how the PLA approaches its military campaigns,\nattempting to shift from the traditional combined arms operations to what the PLA\nrefers to as “integrated joint operations under informationized conditions.” The former\nis characterized by large mechanized formations fighting in tandem but without a\nshared common operating picture and the latter stresses the dominance of\ninformation technology and its ability to shape ground, sea, air, and space into a\nmulti-dimensional battlefield. In the integrated joint operations framework, the PLA\nuses information network technology to connect its services and warfighting\ndisciplines into an integrated operational whole, a concept that is also shaping the\nPLA’s approach to information warfare.\n\n**_Achieving information dominance is one of the key goals for the PLA at the_**\n**_strategic and campaign level, according to The_** **_Science of Military Strategy_** **_and_**\n**_The Science of Campaigns, two of the PLA’s most authoritative public_**\n**_statements on its doctrine for military operations.[ 4]_** Seizing control of an\nadversary’s information flow and establishing information dominance (zhi xinxi quan)\nare essential requirements in the PLA’s campaign strategy and are considered so\nfundamental that The Science of Military Strategy considers them a prerequisite for\nseizing air and naval superiority.[5]\n\n  - _The_ _Science of Military Strategy and The Science of Campaigns both identify_\nenemy C4ISR and logistics systems networks as the highest priority for IW\nattacks, which may guide targeting decisions against the US or other\ntechnologically advanced opponents during a conflict.\n\n  - _The Science of Campaigns states that IW must mark the start of a campaign_\nand, used properly, can enable overall operational success.[6]\n\nThe seeming urgency in making the transition from a mechanized to an\ninformationized force is driven by the perception that winning local wars against\nadversaries with greater technological advantages, such as the United States, may\nnot be possible without a strong information warfare capability to first control enemy\naccess to its own information.[7]\n\n4 Wang Houqing and Zhang Xingye, chief editors, The Science of Campaigns, Beijing,\nNational Defense University Press, May 2000.

PLA\nauthors acknowledge that space dominance is also essential for operating joint\ncampaigns and for maintaining the initiative on the battlefield. Conversely, they view\nthe denial of an adversary’s space systems as an essential component of information\nwarfare and a prerequisite for victory. [9]\n\nThe PLA maintains a strong R&D focus on counterspace weapons and though many\nof the capabilities currently under development exceed purely cyber or EW options,\nthey are nonetheless, still considered “information warfare” weapons.[10] Among the\nmost high profile of China’s ASAT capabilities are kinetic weapons, which rely on\nprojectiles or warheads fired at high speed to impact a satellite directly. The\nsuccessful January 2007 test of this capability against a defunct Chinese weather\nsatellite demonstrated that the PLA has moved past theoretical discussions of this\noption and toward an operational capability.

The perceived benefits are the immediacy,\nand in the case of EMP, the broad scope of the effect.[11]\n\nWhile the use of any of these weapons against US satellites could quickly escalate a\ncrisis, detonating a nuclear device to create an EMP effect runs an especially high\nrisk of crossing US “red lines” for the definition of a nuclear attack, even if the attack\nis carried out in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. Additionally, EMP is nondiscriminatory in its targeting and though the PLA is training and preparing its force to\noperate under “complex electromagnetic conditions,” many of its own space-based\nand possibly terrestrial communications systems may be damaged by either high\naltitude or more localized EMP attacks. At a minimum, EMP and other types of ASAT\nattacks expose the PLA to retaliatory strikes against China’s own burgeoning satellite\nconstellation, potentially crippling its nascent space-based C4ISR architecture.\n\nA full discussion of Chinese capabilities for space information warfare is beyond the\nscope of the present study’s focus on computer network operations, however, the\nsubject is becoming central to the PLA’s discussions of information warfare and in its\nanalysis of informationization in the Chinese force structure.\n\n#### Integrated Network Electronic Warfare \nThe conceptual framework currently guiding PLA IW strategy is called “Integrated\nNetwork Electronic Warfare” (wangdian yitizhan) a combined application of computer\nnetwork operations and electronic warfare used in a coordinated or simultaneous\nattack on enemy C4ISR networks and other key information systems.

Tools like CNA and\nEW, which are perceived to be “bloodless” by many PLA IW operators, may\nbecome first choice weapons for a limited strike against adversary targets to\ndeter further escalation of a crisis.[ 34] This concept may also have implications\nfor PRC leadership willingness to use IW weapons preemptively if they believe\nthat information-based attacks don’t cross an adversary’s “red lines”.\n\nThe PLA may also use IW to target enemy decisionmaking by attacking information\nsystems with deceptive information to shape perceptions or beliefs. The Science of\n_Military Strategy highlights this as a key contribution that IW can make in support of_\nthe overall campaign.

These\nassessments, in turn, depend upon detailed intelligence on the adversary’s network,\nthe C2 relationships, and the various dependencies attached to specific nodes on the\nnetwork.\n\n  - The Science of Military Strategy directs planners to “grasp the operational\ncenter of gravity and choose the targets and sequence for strike…arrange the\nenemy’s comprehensive weaknesses on the selective basis for a list of the\noperational targets, according to the degree of their influences upon the whole\noperational system and procedure.”[41]\n\n  - Mission planners must also understand the explicit and implicit network\ndependencies associated with a given node to avoid undesired collateral\ndamage or the defensive redundancies that may exist to enable the targeted\nunit or organization to reroute its traffic and “fight through” the attack,\neffectively nullifying the Chinese strike.\n\n  - CNA planning also requires a nuanced understanding of the cultural or military\nsensitivities surrounding how a given attack will be perceived by an adversary.\nFailure to understand an enemy’s potential “red lines” can lead to unintentional\nescalation of the conflict, forcing the PLA to alter its campaign objectives or\nfight a completely new campaign for which it may be unprepared.\n\nPLA IW planners and leaders have noted that CNO is blurring the separation that\nmilitary planners maintained between the hierarchy of “strategy,” “campaign,” and\n“combat” (or “tactics” in Western usage) so that CNO or EW weapons employed by\ntactical-sized units can strike strategic targets deep in the adversary’s own territory\nbeyond the range of most conventional weapons, possibly changing the course of the\nconflict.[42] This changing perspective on IW and especially CNO tools may impact the\nsenior leadership perspective on targeting, particularly if the use of these tools is\n\n40 _Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People’s Republic of China 2006, US_\nDepartment of Defense, p. 34.\n41 _Science of Military Strategy, p. 464_\n42 OSC, CPP20081229563002,“Relations Between Strategy, Campaigns And Battles, _China Military_\n_Science, 29 December 2008._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nperceived to have plausible deniability for Beijing or complicates an adversary’s\nability to counterattack.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n## Chinese Computer Network Operations During Conflict\n\nLike the use of missile or air power, CNO is one of several increasingly capable\nwarfighting components available to PLA commanders during a conflict, however, the\nPLA rarely discusses CNO as a standalone capability to be employed in isolation\nfrom other warfighting disciplines. Understanding how it may be used in support of a\nlarger campaign requires Western analysts and policymakers to consider China’s\noverall campaign objectives to understand CNO in its proper context. The current\nstrategy for fighting a campaign in a high tech environment, reflected in the doctrinal\nguidance to “strike the enemy’s nodes to destroy his network,”[43] directs commanders\nto attack the adversary’s C2 and logistics networks first and exploit the resulting\n“blindness” with traditional firepower attacks on platforms and personnel. This\n**_strategy suggests that the PLA may strike with CNO and EW weapons in the_**\n**_opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather_**\n**_than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a_**\n**_disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US._**\n\n  - Denying an adversary access to information systems critical for combat\noperations is influenced by principles of traditional Chinese strategic thought,\nbut the strategy is also the result of extensive contemporary PLA analysis of\nlikely adversaries’ weak points and centers of gravity.\n\n  - While Chinese military leaders are almost certainly influenced by their strategic\nculture and traditions of stratagem, much of China’s contemporary military\nhistory reflects a willingness to use force in situations where the PRC was\nclearly the weaker entity. Scholarship on the subject suggests that PRC\npolitical leaders often determined that conflict in the short term would be less\ncostly than at a later date when strategic conditions were even less favorable\nto China. This logic often seems counterintuitive to the casual Western\nobserver but reflects a nuanced assessment of changing strategic conditions\nand how best to align with them for a favorable outcome. PLA and PRC\nleaders capture this idea often when discussing the use of strategies,\nstratagem, or weapons that enable the weak to overcome the strong.[44]\n\n43 Science of Military Strategy, p. 464.\n44 There is a growing record of contemporary scholarship on strategic culture, deterrence, stratagem,\nand China’s propensity to use force. While it is beyond the scope of the present study, a more\nextensive discussion of the relationship of these topics to contemporary computer network operations\nis essential, particularly one that moves the discussion beyond comparisons of China’s military\nclassics and toward a broader context for understanding the complexity of modern Chinese\nperceptions of IW and the value of CNO.

Whiting, China Crosses the Yalu:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - The PLA’s employment of CNO reflects an intention to use it (with EW\nweapons) as one element of an integrated—and increasingly joint—campaign\ncapability. Campaign doctrine calls for using CNO as a precursor to achieve\ninformation dominance, providing “openings” or opportunities for air, naval,\nand ground forces to act.\n\nCNO in any military crisis between China and the US will likely be used to mount\npersistent attacks against the Department of Defense’s NIPRNET nodes that support\nlogistics, and command and control functions. Attacks such as these are intended to\ndegrade US information and support systems sufficiently for the PLA to achieve its\ncampaign objectives before the US and its Allies can respond with sufficient force to\ndefeat or degrade the PLA’s operation. In a Taiwan scenario, for example, PLA\nplanners likely consider the opening days as the critical window of opportunity to\nachieve military objectives on the island. CNO and other IW weapons that delay a\nUS military response only increase the PLA’s possibility of success without requiring\ndirect combat with superior US forces.\n\n  - Delaying or degrading US combat operations in this Taiwan scenario\nsufficiently to allow the PLA to achieve lodgment on Taiwan or force the\ncapitulation of the political leadership on the island would present the US with\na fait accompli upon arrival in the combat operations area.\n\n  - The majority of US military logistics information systems is transmitted or\naccessed via the NIPRNET to facilitate communication or coordination\nbetween the hundreds of civilian and military nodes in the military’s global\nsupply chain.\n\n#### Logistics Networks and Databases\n\n**_In a conflict, NIPRNET-based logistics networks will likely be a high priority_**\n**_target for Chinese CNA and CNE.

The Chinese have identified the US\nmilitary’s long logistics “tail” and extended time for force build-up as strategic\nvulnerabilities and centers of gravity to be exploited.\n\n  - PLA assessments of US campaigns in Iraq (both Desert Storm and Operation\nIraqi Freedom), the Balkans, and Afghanistan identify logistics and the force\ndeployment times as weak points, the interruption of which will lead to supply\ndelays or shortages. These assessments in aggregate do not seem to\nsuggest that defeating the logistics systems will lead to a de facto US military\ndefeat (PLA professionals likely assume that the US will implement work\naround and ad hoc solutions to these obstacles), but rather that these\ndisruptions will “buy time” for the PLA as noted above.\n\n  - Logistics data of interest to PLA planners are likely areas such as specific unit\ndeployment schedules, resupply rates and scheduled movement of materiel,\nunit readiness assessments, lift availability and scheduling, maritime\nprepositioning plans, air tasking orders for aerial refueling operations, and the\nlogistics status of bases in the Western Pacific theater.\n\n  - _US_ _Joint Publication 4-0: Joint Logistics notes that “the global dispersion of the_\njoint force and the rapidity with which threats arise have made real-time or\nnear real-time information critical to support military operations.

Protected access to networks is imperative to sustain joint\nforce readiness and allow rapid and precise response to meet JFC\nrequirements.”[45]\n\n  - Potential Chinese familiarity with the network topology associated with US\nTransportation Command (USTRANSCOM) or related logistics units on\nNIPRNET could aid CNE missions intended to access and exfiltrate data\nrelated to the time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) of a specific\ncontingency or operations plan. A TPFDD is the logistics “blueprint” for the\nsequence of movement of supplies and is based on a commander’s\nexpression of priorities for personnel and materiel to move into a combat\ntheater.\n\n**_The Chinese may attempt to target potentially vulnerable networks associated_**\n**_with strategic civilian ports, shipping terminals, or railheads that are_**\n\n45US _Joint Publication 4-0: Joint Logistics, 18 July 2008, US Department of Defense, p.I-5 available_\nat: http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp4_0.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n**_supporting the military’s movement of critical supplies and personnel._**\nMaintaining effective movement control during a major mobilization is inherently\ncomplex. Disruptions of information systems at key nodes, particularly “downstream”\nat shipping terminals or airports, while not catastrophic, could create major delays as\nthe traffic en route to the affected destination is forced to slow or halt, similar to the\ncascading traffic delays that can result from a minor accident at rush hour.\n\n  - _US Joint Publication 4-0: Joint Logistics also points out that “inventory_\nmanagement capitalizes on authoritative information (accurate, real-time, and\nwidely visible) and performance trends to inform decisions about attributes of\nthe materiel inventory throughout the supply chain. Maintaining optimal\nstockage levels and accountability of materiel throughout the supply chain\nenables the joint logistician to manage the flow of materiel between strategic\nand tactical supply nodes to meet warfighter requirements.” [46]\n\n  - Many logistics databases on NIPRNET have Web-based interfaces to enable\nease of access, but may only require PLA operators to compromise one weak\npassword via keystroke logging or to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities on\nthe Website to gain user-like access.\n\n  - Long term access to NIPRNET via CNE techniques—and to logistics\ninformation supporting the TPFDD for various warplans in particular—also\nallows the PLA to assemble a detailed current intelligence picture of the\nintended US force deployment packages for specific contingencies.\n\n**_The PLA’s basic CNE/CNA strategy against NIPRNET logistics databases is_**\n**_likely a combination of attacks on selected network segments to limit both the_**\n**_flow and possibly corrupt the content of unencrypted data.

Instrumenting these machines in peacetime may enable\nattackers to prepare a reserve of compromised machines that can be used during a\ncrisis.\n\n  - Chinese CNO operators likely possess the technical sophistication to craft and\nupload rootkit and covert remote access software, creating deep persistent\naccess to the compromised host and making detection extremely difficult.\n\n  - An “upstream” attack on the networks of civilian contractors providing logistics\nsupport to operational units also has potential for great impact and is\npotentially easier against smaller companies that often lack the resources or\nexpertise for sophisticated network security and monitoring.\n\n  - Many of the vulnerabilities outlined above can be greatly minimized if the\nnetwork uses a proxy server, implements firewall blocks of unproxied access,\nblocks proxy access without valid user authentication, and prevents user\ncredentials from being exposed to the attackers.\n\n**_Chinese CNO operators may also attempt to attack US perceptions of the_**\n**_validity of data in these networks by uploading false records or corrupting_**\n**_existing records, possibly for intentional detection. This discovery may generate_**\na manpower and resource intensive review of the targeted unit’s database records or\nother files against a known good back up copy before the unit resumes normal\noperations, creating potentially costly operational delays. If this type of attack is\nstaged against several large or critical supply nodes, the impact could be significant.\n\n  - Uploading files or accessing existing records in NIPRNET-based logistics\ndatabases would require PLA operators to compromise a computer on the\ntargeted LAN and be able to operate with the local users’ credentials, a\ncapability observed in past intrusions of US networks that are attributed to\nChina.\n\n  - The discovery of this type of attack may have a greater impact on US forces\nfrom a perception management or psychological operations perspective than\nthe more localized targeting to redirect supplies.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - Only a limited number of actual compromises may be required to have a\ndisproportionate impact on US operational tempo if information security\nconcerns require time consuming validation of logistics or other databases by\nsystems administrators and logistics personnel across the theater or in\nCONUS.\n\n#### Command and Control Data\n\nMuch of the operational traffic between command entities and subordinate units such\nas unit location, status, situation reports, and deployment orders, is transmitted via\nclassified systems both in peacetime and wartime. Conducting CNO to penetrate\nand compromise the encryption and defensive layers built into the architecture of\nthese systems is a resource intensive and time consuming process for Chinese IW\nunits or the civilian researchers likely supporting them. The Chinese doctrinal\n**_orientation toward attacking an enemy’s information flow suggests that if a_**\n**_classified network is attacked, it will likely be intended to impede encrypted_**\n**_traffic flow if it moves across an unclassified backbone rather than attempting_**\n**_to decrypt data or penetrate into the actual network._**\n\n  - Even if a sensitive encrypted network is not compromised, focused traffic\nanalysis of encrypted communications via computer network exploitation may\nstill yield useful information.\n\n  - If PLA CNO operators are tasked with targeting the networks or databases of\nspecific US military units, then basic network reconnaissance conducted\nduring peacetime can support offensive operations during wartime.\n\n  - Once these units or databases are identified, an attacker can use common\ntechniques or tools to affect a denial of service attack against any server or\nrouter. The sophistication of this type of attack is within the assessed technical\ncapabilities of many individuals in China’s hacker community and likely of PLA\nunits with trained CNO operators.\n\n  - Some CNE operations may be designed for purely reconnaissance purposes\nto map out network topologies and understand the command and control\nrelationships of specific areas of US military or commercial networks rather\nthan exfiltrate data or emplace “sleeper” malicious software on targeted\nmachines.\n\nPLA CNO commanders and operators likely recognize that a capability for peacetime\ncompromise is not a guarantee of wartime access.

Ongoing probes and compromises designed to elicit changes in US\ndefensive posture may, however, provide some insights into how the network\nenvironment will change during periods of heightened threat. Chinese operations,\ntherefore, could also include efforts designed to create intentional “noise” on the\nnetwork that elicits a reaction, allowing the attackers to gather intelligence on how the\nUS defensive posture will change under select circumstances. This is a cyber\nparallel to US Cold War-era electronic warfare operations that were designed to\nprovoke a reaction from Soviet air defense networks to collect intelligence on their\nresponses to various types of threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n## Key Entities in Chinese Computer Network Operations\n\n#### General Staff Department Fourth Department \n**_The GSD 4[th] Department’s traditional offensive EW mission, Dai Qingmin’s_**\n**_leadership of the department during the first half of this decade, and open_**\n**_source reporting that references the Department’s role in implementing INEW,_**\n**_all suggest that it has the primary authority for offensive IW in the PLA._**\n\n  - The 4[th ]Department, also referred to as the Electronic Countermeasures\nDepartment (ECM) Department, oversees both operational ECM units and\nR&D institutes conducting research on a variety of offensive IW technologies.\n\n  - The 4th Department’s oversight of IW dates to at least 1999 and probably\nearlier. Recent scholarship notes that Dai Qingmin’s seminal work, On\n_Information Warfare, was vetted by the 4[th] Department prior to its publication in_\n1999 indicating that it had organizational oversight of this topic even at that\ntime.[48]\n\n  - The GSD’s decision in 2000 to promote Dai Qingmin to head the 4[th]\nDepartment—vetting his advocacy of the INEW strategy—likely further\nconsolidated the organizational authority for the IW—and the CNA mission\nspecifically—in this group. Dai’s promotion to this position suggests that the\nGSD probably endorsed his vision of adopting INEW as the PLA’s IW strategy.\n\n#### General Staff Department Third Department\n**_The GSD Third Department’s longstanding signals intelligence (SIGINT) focus,_**\n**_historical lack of an offensive role, and its large staff of trained linguists and_**\n**_technicians makes it well suited for oversight of the CND and CNE missions in_**\n**_the PLA.

While traditional hackers offer\nunique skill sets in some cases and may have a niche role for PLA or state\nintelligence collection, the PLA clearly is looking to its increasingly mature base of\ncivilian IT expertise to round out its IW ranks.\n\n#### The Chinese Hacker Community \nChina’s hackers, active in thousands of Web-based groups and individually,\nrepresent a mature community of practitioners that has developed a rich knowledge\nbase similar to their counterparts in countries around the world. A review of these\nWeb communities reveals many layers of interest groups: malware tool developers,\nlegitimate security researchers, and novices and experts alike in search of training.\nThe tools or techniques that these groups post are often used by true black hat\npractitioners.\n\nChina’s hacker community gained early notoriety for member willingness to engage in\nlarge-scale politically motivated denial of service attacks, data destruction, and Web\ndefacements of foreign networks, known as hacktivism.  Between 1999 and 2004,\nthe Chinese hacker community was defined by its regular use of large scale,\npolitically motivated attacks against foreign networks or Websites. Chinese hackers\ntraded Web defacements and distributed denial of service attacks with their\ncounterparts in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea and\noperated with relative immunity from Chinese law until strongly worded\ncondemnations issued from Beijing eventually reigned in the attacks. Motivated by\nnationalist fervor, often resulting from a perceived insult to China by a foreign country,\nthe leaders of hacker groups unified their members, identified targets, and often\ndisseminated attack tools via their Websites to ensure mass participation.\n\n  - In May 1998, anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia sparked a series of Chinese\nhacker attacks on multiple Indonesian Websites.\n\n  - Following the accidental bombing of the PRC embassy in Serbia in May 1999,\nChinese hackers mounted their first large scale attack on the White House led\nby the group Javaphile according to one of its founding members, who uses\nthe “screen name” CoolSwallow.[71]\n\n71 Scott Henderson, The Dark Visitor, January 2007, p. 36.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - The 1999 comments by then Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui that Taiwan\ndeserved to be treated as an equal state by the PRC catalyzed massive PRC\nhacker attacks on the Taiwan National Assembly, Presidential Executive Office\nand many additional government Websites, according to Western press\nreports of the exchange.[72]\n\n  - In May 2001, the Honker Union of China claimed that it had attacked over\n1,000 US Websites—approximately the same number that US hackers\nclaimed they attacked in the PRC—following the collision between a US EP-3\nsurveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter.[73]\n\nPRC government reaction to Chinese hacker group participation in the various\n“hacker wars” from 1999 to 2002 was initially encouraging, lauding the efforts of the\nvarious Chinese groups involved. By mid 2002 and after, however, this sentiment\nchanged and official Party media sources published editorials discouraging further\nmass actions online, suggesting that hacking activities in any country were illegal and\nwould not be tolerated.[74] The groups interpreted the editorial as state opposition to\nfuture planned attacks and gradually stood down.\n\n  - In 2001, following a large scale denial of service attack against the White\nHouse, the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party,\nissued an editorial in its online edition that decried the Chinese attacks as\n“Web terrorism,” and said that the attacks by the Honker Union of China on US\nWebsites were “unforgivable acts violating the law,\" effectively withdrawing\nBeijing’s tacit and explicit support from the hacker groups’ campaigns.[75]\n\n  - As government tolerance for large scale attacks against foreign networks\nwaned, many of the most prominent Chinese hacker organizations active in\nthe US-China and cross-Strait exchanges at the beginning of the decade\nappear to have evolved into formal information security research companies\noffering professional information security services. Many others simply\ndisbanded, or reorganized.

The planning for the attack was exposed by a USbased information warfare expert on his blog and the volume of traffic against\nCNN generated from this effort barely registered among Internet security\nanalysts as a denial of service attack.[77]\n\nA February 2009 National People’s Congress expansion of China’s anti-hacking law,\ncoupled with a series of high profile arrests and harsh sentences for hacking crimes,\nwill possibly subject China’s online hacker communities to greater scrutiny and\npossibly discourage some of the overt exchange of tools and hacking advice in open\nonline forums.\n\n  - Previously China’s anti-hacking law only prohibited intrusions into PRC\ngovernment computer systems, technically leaving China’s hackers extremely\nwide latitude for cybercriminal activities. The amendment also added a section\ncriminalizing the creation and dissemination of malicious software.[78]\n\n  - Security authorities have already used the law for several high profile arrests\nand convictions of both amateur and well-established hackers.\n\n76 Mulvenon, “PLA Computer Network Operations,” p. 279.\n77 See Scott Henderson’s Dark Visitor blog at http://www.thedarkvisitor.com/2008/04/new-kinda-lazychinese-hacker-attack-on-cnn-scheduled-for-tomorrow/; and security researcher Jose Nazario’s blog\nat Arbor Networks, at http://asert.arbornetworks.com/2008/04/cnn-attacks-inside-two-dedicated-ddostools/; Mr. Henderson first detected the discussion threads on the attack planning and notified CNN.\nBoth he and Mr. Nazario maintained an ongoing watch on the developments via their respective blog\nsites, publicizing the plans while attempting to update CNN system administrators.\n78 “China Toughens Cybercrime Rules,” Computerworld, May 19, 2009, available at:\nwww.computerworld.com/china_toughens_cybercrime_rules. | “Chinese Lawmakers Consider\nTough Penalties on Hackers,” Xinhua, December 22, 2008, available at:\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/22/content_10544179.htm. | OSC\nCPP20090404718012, “Law Revision Tars \"Patriotic\" Hackers With Same Brush as Thieves\nAnd Troublemakers,” South China Morning Post _Online, 4 April 2009._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n#### Hacktivist Support to the State\n**_Little in the internal writings on Chinese INEW strategy or other writings on IW_**\n**_theory or strategy suggests that the PLA or state security bureaus intend to_**\n**_use hacktivist attacks as a component of a CNO campaign and there is little_**\n**_compatibility between the principles of the INEW strategy as they are known_**\n**_from open sources and the common characteristics of most hacktivist attacks._**\nWhile the simple absence of PLA discussions of the topic—or the absence of sources\nin which it is discussed—does not prove an unwillingness to engage hacker groups in\nthese types of attacks, several factors argue against formal PLA plans to include\nhacktivism as part of a CNO campaign in wartime.\n\n  - _Command and Control: The lack of an easily implemented command and_\ncontrol structure from the PLA to the hacker community at large makes guiding\nor directing attacks extremely difficult. Once initiated, hacktivist attacks have\nthe potential develop their own momentum and begin operating beyond the\nPLA’s or civilian government’s ability to easily control the participants or their\ntargeting. Self-generating hacktivist attacks also have the potential to interfere\nwith sensitive CNO missions by inadvertently disrupting the PLA’s own\ncomputer network attacks. Hacktivist attacks on a Chinese adversary may\nalso risk shutting down lines of communication in use for intelligence collection\nor accidently overwhelm channels the PLA is using as feedback loops to\nmonitor the effectiveness of their network attacks.\n\n  - _Precision Targeting: The core principles that seem to guide the INEW strategy_\nare based on precision targeting and disciplined coordination to strike carefully\nselected nodes of an enemy’s information systems judged to have maximum\noperational impact. The goal is to establish control over the adversary’s ability\nto access or disseminate information. Hacktivist target selection, in contrast, is\ngenerally based on political or nationalist symbolism and not on an alignment\nwith real or perceived PLA campaign objectives and may actually hinder PLA\noperations or intelligence gathering. Chinese hackers reportedly destroyed\nlarge volumes of data on the US Web servers they attacked during the US EP3 crisis in April 2001.[79] Similar data destruction against US military servers\nduring a conflict may eliminate valuable intelligence sources for the PLA or\ndestroy data already altered by the PLA as part of a larger deception or\nperception management operation. Large scale distributed denial of service\nattacks or high profile Web defacements can also potentially undo\n\n79 OSC, CPP20010510000031, “Chinese Hackers Call for Ceasefire in Sino-US Hacker War,” Agence\n_France Presse, 10 May 2001._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nbackchannel or even overt diplomatic efforts to resolve a crisis or negate the\neffects of carefully crafted psychological operations.\n\n  - _Indications and warning: Surprise and deception are central to the INEW_\nstrategy and Chinese hacktivist attacks generally lack both. Online mass\norganization is inherently public and while many hacker groups may implement\nnominal vetting of members or attempt to close their discussion threads, there\nis still a need to publicize the cause, announce the targets and if necessary,\ndisseminate tools; all of which greatly increases the likelihood that the plans\nwill be detected and successfully countered. The organizers of the attempted\nCNN DDoS attack rescheduled their attack and changed Websites in part\nbecause of publicity generated by the US-based researchers noted previously\nwho monitored the attack preparations on the Chinese hacker Websites and\nalerted CNN.\n\n#### Hacker-State Collaboration \n**_While the PRC government appears reluctant to use hacktivism as a CNO tool,_**\n**_there may be a willingness to establish direct relationships with highly skilled_**\n**_individuals or small groups in the hacker community. The PRC government may_**\nalso be able to engage commercial firms comprised of experienced hackers and\noperating as nominally legitimate information security groups. This engagement\nranges from simple job recruitment by government security ministries on hacker\nWebsites to possible support from blackhat code developers for organized intrusions\ninto US Government and commercial networks.\n\n**_Commercially-based white hat information security researchers (i.e. those_**\n**_pursuing overt legal research in the field) are developing extensive government_**\n**_customer bases for hardware and possibly software support. Many of the most_**\nprominent groups from earlier in the decade and their leaders have either disbanded\nor transformed themselves into seemingly legitimate security firms. Large groups like\nXfocus and Black Eagle Base have reshaped themselves into commercial operations,\nalbeit in close alignment with state security and information security objectives.\n\n  - NSFocus, a prominent commercial information security firm, evolved out of the\nGreen Army Alliance, an early—and prominent—hacker group active from\n1997 through 2000; the NSFocus Website still retains logos of the Green Army\nAlliance and the list of its founding members features some of the most\nprominent hackers in China.[80]\n\n80 Scott Henderson, The Dark Visitor, p.29\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - XFocus, a commercial information security company that grew from a hacker\ngroup, annually co-sponsors XCon, one of the largest “hacker conferences” in\nChina in partnership with NSFocus and Venus Technology.\n\n  - Henan Provincial Public Security Bureau authorities shutdown The Patriot\nHackers-Black Eagle Base Website and arrested its members in February\n2006. The group, however, was operational again six months later under the\nname Black Eagle Honker Base when its members released a statement\nclaiming that the group vowed to focus its efforts on training people for the\nstate and working to improve the state’s network security industry, suggesting\na possible cooperative relationship with state authorities as a condition of their\nrelease.[81]\n\n  - The Black Eagle leadership also expressed appreciation to the State Security\nBureau (guojia anquan ju) and the Commission of Science and Technology in\nNational Defense (COSTIND, and now renamed SASTIND[82]) for the\neducational guidance they provided to members while in custody. The latter,\nentity, charged with overseeing national defense industry policy, is not typically\nreferenced in connection with hacker groups or their activities.[83]\n\n**_Individuals, or possibly groups, engaged in computer network exploitation_**\n**_against US networks have obtained malicious software developed by Chinese_**\n**_underground or black hat programmers. The ability to obtain this custom code_**\nindicates that these operators have ties to select members of the hacker\nunderground.\n\nIn one demonstrated instance, black hat programmers affiliated with Chinese hacker\nforums provided malicious software to intruders targeting a US commercial firm in\nearly 2009. The techniques and tools employed by this group or individual are similar\nto those observed in previous penetration attempts against this same company in the\nprevious year, according to their forensic analysis.\n\n  - Forensic analysis also suggests this group is comprised of multiple members\nof varying skill levels, operating with fixed schedules and standard operating\nprocedures and is willing to take detailed steps to mask their activities on the\ntargeted computer.\n\n81 OSC, CPP20060810443001, “Patriot Hacker Website 'Restored' After ‘Guidance,” 10 August 2006\n82 In March 2008, the Commission on Science and Technology for National Defense\n(COSTIND) was reorganized and subordinated to the Ministry of Information Industry and\nTechnology (MIIT) and is now called State Administration on Science and Technology for\nNational Defense (SASTIND).\n83 OSC, FEA20060811026153, “PRC Patriot Hacker Website Restored After Guidance,” 10\nAugust 2006.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - Open source research on the screen name of the coder who created the\nmalware used in the early 2009 attack revealed that the individual is likely a\nnative Chinese speaker who posted a keystroke logging program with rootkit\nelements to a discussion board on a prominent Chinese hacker group\nWebsite known as EvilOctal.\n\n  - The coder created the PDF document used as the attachment to carry the\nmalicious software with a tool that is only available in Chinese called\nFreePic2Pdf, version 1.26; this document was modified to covertly install a\nzero day exploit that targeted a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe\nAcrobat.[84]\n\n  - Upon successful installation on the victim system after the user opened the\nattachment, the Trojan horse malware began periodically attempting to\nconnect with another machine overseas, essentially sending a beacon to let\nthe attackers know that a machine had been successfully attacked. The\nintruders only completed this connection when they were ready to commence\nthe next phase of the operation via encrypted communications with the victim\ncomputer.\n\n  - The operators worked in a three shift, 24 hour cycle issuing reconnaissance\ncommands identical to those observed in previous attacks.\n\n  - When significant differences were recognized between this computer and\npreviously compromised systems on the same network, the attack team\nextracted small amounts of data to determine the configuration of security\nsoftware installed and their ability to access targeted data on the company’s\nnetwork.\n\n  - The operators installed a rootkit, which gives the attacker privileged access to\na victim computer while remaining undetectable, suggesting the attackers\nintended long-term covert use of the victim computer. The attackers\nconfigured the rootkit to execute upon the next system reboot, effectively\nhiding the operators’ files, programs, network connections and registry\nsettings, however, operator error caused a problem in the rootkit execution\nand locked the attackers out of the targeted computer, ending the operation,\naccording to forensic analysis.\n\n84 See details on this vulnerability at: http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa0901.html and http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/905281.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - The rootkit code is still not publicly available, suggesting that the attacker\nobtained it directly from the coder or someone with direct access to this\nindividual.\n\n**_The creator of another zero day exploit used to target US companies in the fall_**\n**_of 2008 developed the code in Chinese and on a machine with Chinese set as_**\n**_the default language indicating that this individual was also likely a native or_**\n**_fluent speaker. Little additional detail about the developer’s identity is available from_**\nforensic analysis but it reinforces the assertion that a relationship exists between\nChinese black hat programmers and individuals responsible for intrusions into US\nnetworks.\n\n  - US companies began receiving small waves of spam-like emails with a\nMicrosoft WordPad (.wri) file attachment containing a small piece of malicious\nsoftware that acted as a Trojan, enabling the attackers to gain complete\naccess to the targeted computers, a hallmark of the computer network\nexploitation tradecraft attributed to China. The malware exploited a zero day\nvulnerability in Microsoft’s WordPad application.[85]\n\n  - The attachment sent in these email attacks contained two components: an\nEnglish language carrier document that appears to be a generic contract\ntemplate for a defense firm to use with a sub-contractor, and the Chinese\nlanguage exploit code inserted inside the carrier document.\n\n  - When the recipient of the apparent spam email attempted to open the attached\n.pdf file, the file installed both the malware and a backdoor service on the\ntargeted machine that was designed to execute the next time the user logged\nin.\n\n**_The malware, sent in a wave of spearphishing attacks against various US_**\n**_companies, was intended to provide the intruder with the ability to remotely_**\n**_access and control the targeted computers, another common characteristic of_**\n**_computer network exploitation activities attributed to China._**\n\n  - The newly installed service connects to an external host outside of the\ntargeted company’s network and allows the intruder to take control of the\nvictim's machine remotely with the same access and operational capabilities\nas though they were sitting at the user’s keyboard.\n\nProgramming bugs in the malware used during the fall 2008 campaign and the\nintruders’ ability to quickly obtain an earlier version as a replacement program,\n\n85 See Microsoft Security Advisory 960906.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nstrongly suggests this was the first time the newer version was being used by these\nattackers. Their ability to obtain a replacement version quickly may be the result of\nhaving access to the developer or someone managing a repository of the developer’s\nwork. If the latter is true, it implies the existence of a support infrastructure for the\nindividuals targeting US Government and commercial networks. However, this is still\nspeculative and requires further research to corroborate.\n\n  - The initial version of the malware was compiled in late October 2008 and used\nwithin weeks by the intruders. This short time interval between the date of\ncreation and first use implies that the intruder (or intruders) had the means to\nobtain customized zero-day malware quickly.\n\n  - When they encountered operational problems with the code, the intruders\nquickly obtained an older version of the malware, compiled in January 2008\nand resumed their work with little delay.\n\n#### Government Recruitment from Hacker Groups \nGovernment efforts to recruit from among the Chinese hacker community and\nevidence of consulting relationships between known hackers and security services\nindicates some government willingness to draw from this pool of expertise. It does not\nimply that authorities have established many such relationships or intends to enlist\nwhole groups for large attacks on US systems.\n\n  - Between July 2007 and November 2008, an individual using the screen name\n“City_93” posted job vacancy announcements for the Ministry of Public\nSecurity’s First Research Institute (posting a Web address www.fri.com.cn) on\nthe discussion board for EvilOctal.com and XFocus.net, two of the largest and\nin the case of XFocus, most established hacker forums in China.\n\n  - “City_93” eventually posted 10 vacancy notices on Evil Octal between 2007\nand 2008 and on both sites engaged in lengthy discussion threads on the\napplication procedures and nature of the job with interested users. The job\npostings were for entry level programmers with experience in the development\nand implementation of network security system projects.\n\n  - The MPS First Research Bureau provides a variety of science and technology\nresearch and development to operational elements of the MPS.

Western media reports that claim that the PRC\ngovernment has recruited an “internet army” from among the millions of Chinese\nhackers, are spurious at best. The limited reporting available from open sources,\nhowever, does suggest that some precedent exists for state security organizations to\nseek computer network operations expertise from individuals with sophisticated\nhacker skill sets.

The return on present investment for targeting sensitive US information in this\nway (the intelligence gain) can be extraordinarily high while the barriers to entry (the\nskills and technologies required to implement an operation) are comparatively low.\nMany countries are in the process of developing capabilities to either respond\ndefensively to this threat or build their own offensive network operations programs,\nhowever, China is most frequently cited as the primary actor behind much of the\nactivity noted in media reporting, and US officials are increasingly willing to publicly\nacknowledge that China’s network exploitation and intelligence collection activities\nare one of this country’s most consuming counterintelligence challenges.\n\nChina’s development of its computer network operations capability extends beyond\npreparations for wartime operations. The PLA and state security organizations have\nbegun employing this capability to mount a large scale computer network exploitation\neffort for intelligence gathering purposes against the US and many countries around\nthe world, according to statements by US officials, accusations by targeted foreign\ngovernments, and a growing body of media reporting on these incidents.\n\nA long term, persistent campaign to collect sensitive but unclassified information from\nUS Government and US defense industry networks using computer network\nexploitation techniques, long attributed to China, has successfully exfiltrated at least\n10 to 20 terabytes of data from US Government networks as of 2007, according to\nUS Air Force estimates and that figure has possibly grown in the past two years,\nthough no figure is publicly available.\n\n97 The content of the following section is based upon analysis of media but also upon the deep\nexperience and insights that Northrop Grumman Corporation has gained as a major provider of\ninformation security services and its own experience defending a large, geographically dispersed\nenterprise.

He further noted that the\nintelligence collected from these computer reconnaissance campaigns can be used\nfor myriad purposes, including identifying weak points in the networks, understanding\nhow leaders in the United States think, discovering the communication patterns of\nAmerican government agencies and private companies, and attaining valuable\ninformation stored throughout the networks.[98]\n\n**_A review of the scale, focus, and complexity of the overall campaign directed_**\n**_against the United States and, increasingly, a host of other countries around_**\n**_the world strongly suggest that these operations are state-sponsored or_**\n**_supported._** The operators appear to have access to financial, personnel, and\nanalytic resources that exceed what organized cybercriminal operations or multiple\nhacker groups operating independently could likely access consistently over several\nyears. Furthermore, the categories of data stolen do not have inherent monetary\nvalue like credit card numbers or bank account information that is often the focus of\ncybercriminal organizations. Highly technical defense engineering information,\nmilitary related information, or government policy analysis documents are not easily\nmonetized by cybercriminals unless they have a nation-state customer, making the\nactivity “state-sponsored” by default, regardless of the affiliation of the actual\noperators at the keyboard.\n\nThe scope of operational activities, deep knowledge of the targeted networks, and\nvolume and topics of data exfiltrated suggest that the attackers are supporting\nconsumers involved in defense related engineering research, policy specialists\ninterested in US-China relations, and military planners gathering intelligence on US\nmilitary information systems and operations.\n\nUS Government officials assess that this activity, in the aggregate, has the potential\nto erode the United States’ long term position as a world leader in S&T innovation\nand competitiveness and the collection of US defense engineering data has possibly\nsaved the recipient of the information years of R&D and significant amounts of\nfunding.[99]\n\n98 “China’s Military Modernization And Its Impact On The United States And The Asia-Pacific,”\nHearing before The U.S.-China Economic And Security Review Commission, March 29-30, 2007, p.\n7; Available at\nhttp://www.uscc.gov/hearings/2007hearings/transcripts/mar_29_30/mar_29_30_07_trans.pdf\n99 Jeff Bliss, ‘‘China’s Spying Overwhelms U.S. Counterintelligence,’’ Bloomberg, April 2, 2007. |\nShane Harris, “China’s Cyber-Militia,” The National Journal, Saturday, May 31, 2008, available online\nat: http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/cs_20080531_6948.php\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n**_These operations are succeeding in part because current industry and US_**\n**_government information security paradigms are largely based on reactive_**\n**_controls such as traditional signature-based anti-virus vendor models,_**\n**_common host and network defensive measures that are often inadequate_**\n**_against advanced attackers. When a product vendor or the research community_**\ndiscloses new security vulnerabilities, security software vendors rapidly analyze it and\nproduce “signatures,” or encoded representations of the anticipated effects of an\nattack against this new vulnerability. These signatures are applied to network control\ndevices such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) and firewalls,\nand on individual computers as anti-virus rules or host IDS/IPS signatures. Adding\nsignatures proactively to these systems without prior knowledge of a vulnerability or\npossibly an observed or lab-generated sample attack, is difficult and often\ndiscouraged.\n\n  - Many organizations are reluctant to patch systems and software against\nvulnerabilities for which there have not been publicly released exploits. Larger\norganizations with more mature security practices or resources often use\ncomplex behavioral signatures, or models, applied to Security Event and\nInformation Management (SEIM) or Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA)\nsystems but these techniques are usually fed by component signature-based\nsystems, they, too, suffer the same shortcomings.\n\n  - NBA systems show greater promise when tuned to look for anomalous\nbehavior, however, there is generally much greater administrative overhead\nand a high false alarm rate in this mode.\n\n  - Traditional network and system management is a balancing act of\nperformance, expense and security and common wisdom dictates a certain\nhesitance to make changes on functioning, often critical, systems.\n\n**_These operators exploit this reactive defense model and they have the_**\n**_resources necessary to develop and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities_**\n**_that are often are missed by signature-based IDS/IPS and endpoint protection_**\n**_software. The Chinese academic community and hacker groups—like many hacker_**\ngroups around the world—are heavily focused on researching new zero-day\nvulnerabilities.\n\n  - Anecdotal reporting from information security industry sources suggest that\nChinese researchers are also willing to purchase zero day attack tools from\nthird party sources, though this has not been independently corroborated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - Zero day exploits are bought and sold in numerous public and private markets\nwithout the involvement of the victim software's vendors, often for tens of\nthousands of dollars per vulnerability.[100]\n\n**_The overall effort likely consists of multiple groups and skilled individuals_**\n**_operating against different targets given the high operational tempo and_**\n**_diversity of targeting observed to date (see Timeline of Alleged Chinese_**\n**_Intrusions below). These operators, some possibly affiliated with PRC government_**\nor military organizations and others probably freelance hackers, have access to\nsoftware developers capable of developing zero day exploits and using tools that are\noften created on computers with Chinese language settings or Chinese language\ndeveloper kits.\n\n  - The adversaries associated with this issue are successful because they are\nable maintain a presence on a targeted network for extended periods enabling\nthem establish a connection to a compromised computer on the network when\noperationally required for activities such as reconnaissance of the network\ntopology, determining where high value information resides, or to conduct\nsocial and professional network analysis to support future spearphishing\ncampaigns.\n\n  - This latter information is exploited most frequently to craft specific, seemingly\nlegitimate-looking, emails to targeted users often referencing a current project\nor meeting with which the recipient is involved. The emails usually contain\neither malicious software embedded in an attachment or links to malicious\nWebsites.[101]\n\n  - The scale and complexity of targeting associated with this effort suggests that\nit is probably backed by a mature collection management bureaucracy able to\ncollate and disseminate collection priorities to diverse teams of operators,\nintelligence analysts, and malware developers. These individuals are likely a\nmix of uniformed military personnel, civilian intelligence operators, and\nfreelance high-end hackers.\n\nThese types of attacks often begin with an email message with a file attached\ncontaining both the exploit code and another small piece of software which will give\nthe attacker control of the victim's computer. When this file, usually an image,\n\n100See for example: http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/470 and\nhttp://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Hackers-Selling-Vista-ZeroDay-Exploit/ for additional background.\n101 Brian Grow, Keith Epstein and Chi-Chu Tschang, “The New E-spionage Threat,” BusinessWeek,\nApril 10, 2008, available online at:\nhttp://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_16/b4080032218430.htm\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\ndocument, or spreadsheet is opened by the vulnerable program on the victim's\ncomputer (e.g. Powerpoint, Wordpad, Adobe Acrobat, etc), the backdoor program\nexecutes. Email is the most common entry vector because the operators are often\nable to learn an employee’s (or group of employees’) trust relationships (i.e. their\nprofessional networks) by analyzing who they frequently email. The intruders then\ncraft credible looking emails from members or groups within an individual’s network\nthat the target will likely open.[ 102]\n\nDate: Tue, 10 Dec 2008 06:58:13 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: John Doe <john.q.googdguy@yahoo.com>\nTo: employee.name@companyname.com\n\nSubject: 7th Annual U.S. Defense Conference\n\n7th Annual U.S. Defense Conference\n1-2 Jan 2009\n\nRonald Reagan Building and International Trade Center\nWashington, DC\n\nDownload 2009 Conference Preliminary Program (PDF)\nhttp://conferences.satellite-stuff.net/events/MDA_Prelim_09.zip\n\nDownload 2009 Conference Registration Form (PDF)\nhttp://conferences.satellite-stuff.net/events/MDA09_reg_form.zip\n\nContact: John Doe\nContractor Information Systems\n(703) 555-1234\njohn.doe@yahoo.com\nFigure 6: A sample of an attack email that was sent simultaneously to many US commercial\nfirms.

The registration form and program files, when\ndownloaded and unzipped, gave the attacker complete remote control of the targeted\nuser’s computer. The operators tasked with targeting had previously identified this\ncompany’s employee and all of the other recipients, as someone likely to be\ninterested in the subject of the email and download the form by surveying his or her\nonline presence: conference attendee lists, subscriptions to newsgroups, social\nnetworking sites such as Facebook and Linkedin, and corporate public affairs\nreleases.\n\n102 Brian Grow, Keith Epstein and Chi-Chu Tschang, “The New E-spionage Threat,” BusinessWeek,\nApril 10, 2008, available online at:\nhttp://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_16/b4080032218430.htm\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - The operators often reuse the employee’s profiles generated by this\nreconnaissance in multiple targeting attempts either because the user failed to\nopen the attachment the first time or simply because they are an “easy mark”\nwho usually opens these emails and thus represent a reliable entry vector for\nthe intruders.\n\n  - This initial penetration with email and malicious attachment is frequently only\nthe first phase of an advanced operation as the users targeted first and the\ndata on their computers are often not the actual target of collection. Targeting\nthe data owners of the attacker’s actual collection objective increases the risk\nof detection and possible implementation of tighter controls around the data\nthey are seeking to exfiltrate, making later attempts more difficult.\n\n**_Analysis of forensic data associated with penetrations attributed to_**\n**_sophisticated state sponsored operators suggests that in some operations_**\n**_multiple individuals are possibly involved, responsible for specific tasks such_**\n**_as gaining and establishing network access, surveying portions of the targeted_**\n**_network to identify information of value, and organizing the data exfiltration._**\nOne role is an entry or “breach team” tasked only with gaining entry and maintaining\na flexible, redundant presence in the target network (essentially “picking the lock” and\nensuring not only that the door stays open, but that there are multiple doors available\nif the one being used is “closed”). Once the breach team has successfully\nestablished access to the network, a possible second team or individual conducts the\ndata reconnaissance and ultimately locates and exfiltrates targeted data.\n\nReasons for using different individuals or groups could be due to the specialized skills\nrequired for each phase of an intrusion or perhaps for “compartmentation” reasons:\nthe first team or operator does not need to know the details of what is being targeted\nby the second team or operator, thus ideally, improving overall operational security.\nThese explanations are, however, largely speculative as the fidelity of data on these\nincidents almost never provides insight into the internal communications, identity, or\nrelationship dynamics of the actual people behind these intrusions.\n\n  - This type of task oriented structure requires multiple skill sets, possibly\nrequiring several individuals to complete one operation. This model, if\naccurate, also implies some means of recruiting, organizing, and managing a\nteam like this and ensuring proper completion of a given mission. If this model\nis indeed accurate and it is being replicated across dozens of intrusions over\ntime, then that oversight structure must be proportionately larger and more\ncomplex as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - Once the breach team or individual has secured a foothold on the first victim’s\ncomputer, they also continue to collect information about this machine’s\nsecurity configuration, settings, and related system information to solidify their\npresence, sometimes by sniffing and stealing passwords from authentication\nsystems, collecting user email to support future deceptive attacks, gather\nnetwork usernames, group membership information and directory listings of\nnetwork shared folders.\n\n  - Operators have also attacked mobile users’ virtual private network (VPN)\nsoftware, which allows employees of a company to access their corporate\nnetwork while outside of the office. Operators have modified VPN software to\nallow access back into the network through the remote user's systems.\nAttackers have on occasion installed additional network software to mask their\nremote control communications, such as encryption rootkits that hide the\nattackers’ presence from legitimate system administrators.\n\n  - All of these steps help ensure long-term access to the target organization's\nnetwork and help provide freedom of movement to the attackers once inside\nthe network.\n\n**_These attackers have also demonstrated an awareness of a targeted_**\n**_organization’s information security measures according to forensic analysis of_**\n**_attacker activity, and appear able to alter their operations to avoid detection,_**\n**_reflecting the highly detailed reconnaissance that they—or others on their_**\n**_behalf—conduct. The attackers in these operations likely use tools or techniques_**\nthat are only as sophisticated as they need to be for the environment in which they\nare operating, holding their more capable tools in reserve until genuinely required.\n\n  - Attackers have demonstrated some ability to respond to adjustments in\nsecurity configurations to ensure maximum time “on station” to accomplish\ntheir collection mission. These responses include, but are not limited to,\nshifting to stealthier communications channels, jumping to different C2 servers,\nthe rapid deletion of toolkits upon detection of defender presence and the\nharvesting of configuration files to support further target analysis.\n\n  - The individuals responsible for maintaining access have demonstrated\nflexibility in responding to unexpected changes in network defenses by the\ntargeted organization, suggesting they prepare for these contingencies in\nadvance, similar to conducting an “enemy course of action” analysis.\nGenerally, this preparation has involved the pre-placement of redundant\ncommunication channels, C2 nodes on multiple external servers, and multiple\nbreach points in a targeted network (usually other computers in the targeted\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nnetwork that have already been compromised and are held in reserve until\nneeded).\n\n  - The malware that these operators employ often tries to communicate with (or\n“beacon” to) a pre-established command and control server located in a\nvariety of countries. This beaconing can continue for extended periods of time\nbefore the operators are ready to engage, establish a connection with and\nthen take control over the victim system.\n\n**_Additional individuals or teams probably tasked with the collection of the_**\n**_actual targeted information, have demonstrated greater skill and highly detailed_**\n**_knowledge of the targeted networks. Their efforts to locate and move data off of_**\nthe network often involves techniques that place a premium on redundancy, stealth\nand comprehensiveness of preparation and attention to detail.\n\n  - Using network intelligence likely gathered during earlier reconnaissance\nefforts, these collection teams have in some cases copied the data from the\nservers and workstations to a second server that acts as a “staging point”\nwhere they compress, encrypt, segment and replicate it before distributing it\nthrough encrypted channels out of the targeted organization to multiple\nexternal servers that act as “drop points.”\n\n  - These drop points may also play an obfuscation role, ensuring that\ninvestigators are unable to identify the data’s final destination.\n\nChina’s defense industry is producing new generations of weapon platforms with\nimpressive speed and quality, and while these advancements are due to a variety of\ndomestic factors, Chinese industrial espionage is providing a source of new\ntechnology without the necessity of investing time or money to perform research.\nComputer network exploitation in support of these collection requirements has\npossibly expanded the range and detail of information available for collection in a way\nthat previously required close HUMINT-enabled access to obtain the data (e.g. an\nagent inside or close proximity to a US citizen and their laptop or other electronics).\nChinese espionage in the United States, which now comprises the single greatest\nthreat to U.S. technology, according to US counterintelligence officials,[103] is straining\nthe U.S. capacity to respond. This illicit activity both from traditional techniques and\ncomputer-based activity are possibly contributing to China’s military modernization\nand its acquisition of new technical capabilities.\n\n103 _2007 Report to Congress of the US China Economic and Security Review Commission, November_\n2007, p. 7., available at: http://www.uscc.gov\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n## Operational Profile of An Advanced Cyber Intrusion \n\n_The following case study is based wholly upon an internal post-incident forensics_\n_investigation and discussions with information security specialists from a single_\n_affected firm following a penetration and data exfiltration by intruders likely_\n_associated with a state sponsored operation. The company’s internal analysis of_\n_the incident indicates that the attacks came through, or originated from, China and_\n_many of the techniques are consistent with the operational profile attributed to other_\n_attacks believed to originate from China. This case study reflects the details of only_\n_a single incident. Private sector firms—even within a given industry—frequently_\n_employ a variety of information security tools and strategies based on their unique_\n_network architecture and approaches to risk management._\n\nInformation security analysts at a large US commercial firm several years ago\ndetected a high volume of data being sent from their network to multiple computers in\nthe US and overseas, with many aspects of the activity matching the profile often\nassociated with other state sponsored attacks. The analysts quickly began putting\nblocks in place on their network to halt the data loss but not before significant\nvolumes of data were lost to the intruders.\n\nThe scale of this operation, which also targeted other large US companies within a\nseveral week period suggests a disciplined command and control structure, a means\nof sharing specific data collection requirements for various targeted companies and\nthe capability to collate and process extremely large volumes of data once exfiltrated.\nAdditionally, in this specific incident at least, the attackers selected the data for\nexfiltration with great care. Though they had the opportunity, they did not simply\n“take what they could get” and leave, rather, they chose specific files, often ignoring\nrelated information in adjacent directory locations, activity which suggests these\nattackers were disciplined and operating from a specific list of collection\nrequirements, a characteristic usually only found in highly professional operations.\n\nDuring the incident described below, the attackers did not open and review file\ncontents—though they had the required file permissions—but instead navigated\nimmediately to the files or folders they wanted and began the steps necessary to\nexfiltrate them, suggesting that they had reviewed the directory contents offline and\nthat they had already gained access to this firm’s network to conduct detailed\nreconnaissance, including the possible exfiltration of file directory listings.\n\nThese types of operational techniques are not characteristic of amateur hackers\noperating in widely dispersed geographic areas. While the affiliation of the individual\noperators is impossible to establish, the coordination required to stage this operation\nsuggests that even if these were freelance operators not directly affiliated with a state\nor military organization, they had professional quality organization and discipline and\na specific set of collection objectives, evidenced as much by what they didn’t take—\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\ndespite having easy access to the data—as what they did take. The type and\nspecificity of data stolen in this case also suggests that the end users were already\nidentified and that they likely had deep science and technology resources at their\ndisposal to make use of the stolen information.\n\nWhile attribution is always the most difficult component of information security\ninvestigations, hackers—individuals and groups alike—tend to operate in a consistent\nmanner, exhibiting a preference for specific tools, possess a unique keyboard\npresence,[104] and often tend to target the same types of data across their targets.\nThis case is consistent with other incidents attributed to Chinese intrusions into US\nnetworks though no firm attribution data was available from this case.\n\n**_Over a multi-day period during this incident, intruders staged a complex data_**\n**_exfiltration operation and_** **_while the activity associated with this incident_**\n**_occurred within a relatively short span of time, the preparations and_**\n**_reconnaissance necessary to support it had likely been ongoing for months._**\nThe teams or individuals who carried out this operation displayed discipline and a\ndeep knowledge of the network architecture they targeted, suggesting that these\noperators had likely spent months patiently assembling a detailed picture of this\nnetwork.\n\n  - Identical remote communication and administrative tools and operational\ntechniques were used in earlier incidents with this and other companies; they\noperated at times using a communication channel between a host with an IP\naddress located in the People’s Republic of China and a server on the\ncompany’s internal network, a technique observed consistently in similar\nintrusions at other commercial firms.\n\n  - Analysis of the operation suggests that the adversaries previously identified\nspecific directories, file shares, servers, user accounts, employee full names,\npassword policies, and group memberships on the network, likely during their\ndetailed reconnaissance phase.\n\n  - They did not open any files to review the contents prior to exfiltration,\nsuggesting they already knew the contents or at a minimum, the file names of\nthe data they were tasked with stealing.\n\n104 An individual’s “keyboard behavior” in the context of computer network intrusions refers to the\nspecific habits that a hacker might develop over the course of performing certain functions many times.\nThe sophistication, frequency, combination of commands, and elapsed time between keyboard entries\ncan all help in the creation of a “forensic profile” an individual attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nThe adversary used at least two groups in the operation; a breach team (referred to\nby these information security analysts as “Team One”) and a collection team (known\nas “Team Two”), responsible for gathering and exfiltrating the targeted data.\n\n  - Each team employed distinct toolkits and used them in unique ways\nsuggesting not only different operational goals but also different individuals at\nthe keyboard.\n\n  - The teams maintained a base of instrumented hosts on the company’s\nnetwork that they held in reserve for use as required at external locations to\nsupport their covert communications for an extended period of time.\n\nPrior to this data exfiltration, the company’s information security analysts had\ndetected activity attributed to these types of sophisticated attackers, but it was\ngenerally characterized by low volumes of traffic through compromised hosts and\nappeared primarily focused on maintaining access and presence. The company’s\ninformation security staff detected and countered these compromises in the months\nprior to the final data exfiltration, however, the attackers’ appear to have simply\ncreated new entry vectors or reverted back to other pre-established means of\naccessing the company’s network. The reconnaissance phase seems to have been\nsufficiently methodical and quiet to permit the compilation of an accurate map of the\nnetwork over time. The adversary identified servers, file shares, individual\nemployees, user groups, and the credentials necessary to support a complex data\nexfiltration operation later.\n\nCommand and Control Session with\n\nC2\n\nExternal Controller\n\nCompromised User Workstations Workstation Workstation\n\nStaging Systems Accessed by\n\nStaging Staging Staging\n\nWindows Remote Desktop\n\nCorporate File Servers File Server File Server File Server\n\nExfiltration Hosts Exfiltration Exfiltration Exfiltration\n\n(Internal Hosts) Host Host Host\n\nExternal Collection Points External Host External Host External Host\n\nFigure 7: Diagram of the data exfiltration operation attributed to a sophisticated—possibly state\nsponsored—intrusion into a US commercial network.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n#### Intruder Command and Control Infrastructure\n**_Analysis of the intruders’ activity prior to, and during, the exfiltration_**\n**_operation indicates that their command and control architecture relied upon_**\n**_previously stolen valid user accounts to authenticate to the company’s_**\n**_internal servers. Once authenticated, they established communications with a_**\nvariety of previously compromised computers inside the company’s network. The\noperators then tunneled Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) within their existing\ncommunication channels to establish contact with the targeted hosts for purposes\nranging from maintaining basic access to the control of the eventual data\nexfiltration. Additional stolen account names and passwords were used as needed\nto gain access to otherwise protected resources such as computers, network\nshares, folders and files.\n\n  - Analysis of proxy logs and forensic data revealed that the operators used\ndozens of employee accounts on almost 150 occasions to access the\nnetwork in the days leading up to the exfiltration.\n\n  - At times, they used highly privileged administrative accounts and passed\nNTLM hashes in lieu of passwords directly to the proxy authentication\nmechanism.[105] The use of password hashes, which were harvested directly\nfrom compromised domain controllers, appears designed to defeat any twofactor authentication (T-FA) techniques that may have been in place to\ndefend against brute-force password cracking tools.\n\n  - The use of NTLM hashes, which were harvested from domain controllers\nusing password collection tools, appears designed to defeat any multifactor\nauthentication techniques that may have been in place to defend against\nbrute-force password cracking tools.\n\n  - The adversary also repeatedly enumerated group membership of accounts\nin the organization’s primary domain, which assisted them in the identifying\nwhich employee accounts to use when trying to access files restricted to\ncertain users.\n\n105 Many proxy servers can be configured to require an NTLM challenge/response authentication\nbefore access is granted to the protected resource, such as Internet/WWW/FTP access. If an\nattacker is in possession of the authentication hashes, they can use the hash directly, rather than\nfirst “crack” the password, then re-hash it for the authentication service.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n#### Movement of Targeted Data to Intermediate “Staging Servers” \nDuring the first several days of this incident, the adversary transferred the data\nselected for exfiltration from company file servers (where it normally resided) to\nMicrosoft Exchange email servers that acted as intermediate staging points (See\nFigure 7, the transfer occurred between the Staging Systems and the Corporate\nFile Servers in this diagram). Their reconnaissance of the network enabled them to\nselect servers that offered the highest performance and network throughput. The\nidentification and selection of these servers, again, underscores the adversary’s\nprecise knowledge of this network’s architecture, gained from detailed\nreconnaissance prior to this operation.\n\nThe attackers began the preparations for moving data from the files servers to the\nstaging points by establishing clear lines of command and control and identifying\nthe appropriate hosts to use for the staging and exfiltration phases of the\noperation. Analysis of the available data indicates that the adversaries, using\nstandard Windows file transfer tools, moved targeted data from the shares to the\nstaging servers.\n\n  - Operators likely associated with the collection team (Team 2), using an\ninternal host as a C2 node, established multiple connections through\nencrypted RDP sessions to various internal email servers prior to staging\ndata on these machines.\n\n  - Forensic data revealed an increase of short duration communications\nbetween the internal hosts used as C2 nodes and email servers in the days\nprior to the staging operation. This process was likely to identify and\nconfirm the resources that would be used in all phases of the subsequent\noperation.\n\n  - Concurrent with this activity, the adversaries also established\ncommunications between the email servers used for the exfiltration\noperation and an external Website that was likely under their control. The\nattackers used this as their primary C2 channel to control at least seven of\nthe internal email servers while they prepared their operation (see the\nexternal drop points in Figure 7).\n\nAfter moving data to staging servers, the operators renamed all targeted files with\nnondescript labels to resemble a legitimate Windows application likely selected to\nappear innocuous on the staging servers.\n\n  - Once the transfer to staging servers was complete, the attackers encrypted\nand compressed the files into numbered volumes of RAR archives—all\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nexactly the same size—in preparation for exfiltration.[106]\n\n  - Information security analysts within the company noted that the tools and\ntechniques used for this process closely matched that used in previously\ndetected activity on the organization’s network, confirming either that this\nwas the same entity or that operators responsible for different intrusions\nhave a means of sharing data about their targets or activities.\n\n#### Exfiltration of Data from the Internal Network \n**_Reflecting their methodical preparations, these operators used seven_**\n**_servers almost in tandem to move data out of the company’s network,_**\n**_suggesting that speed was a priority during this phase of the operation. The_**\nmovement of data out of the internal network is the most vulnerable phase of the\nentire operation because of defensive tools the company had in place on its\nnetwork perimeter and was the only point that they were detected during their\nmulti-day presence in the network in preparation for this action.\n\nThe final stage of the exfiltration operation began in the evening (local time for this\nfirm), after all of the targeted data was staged on the intermediate hosts. Prior to\nstarting the exfiltration, the operators prepared with characteristic care:\nestablishing an overarching C2 channel, testing their connections, possibly\nrehearsing their procedures, and checking their available bandwidth before\nbeginning the actual exfiltration.\n\n  - After the commencement of the exfiltration from a single email server,\noperators enumerated all of the email servers in the targeted areas. This\nwas significant because their request used the company’s standard internal\nnaming convention for these servers in the geographic area where the\nservers were located, knowledge that is obtained only through highly\ndetailed reconnaissance of the network.[107] The command returned a list of\nseveral dozen servers, 75 percent of which they used in the operation as\neither staging or exfiltration points.\n\n  - The teams involved in the operation prepared for the actual exfiltration by\n\n106 Of note, the RAR archives were all exactly 650MB in size, the maximum capacity of a standard\nCD ROM, indicating a possible future storage or transfer medium.\n107 Organizations with networks dispersed over large geographic regions often use a naming\nconvention for their servers that identifies the physical location of the server, followed by internal\ncompany organizational details or a code to represent the server’s role, e.g. a print server located in\nMontana in the XY Division may be internally named “MTXYP012.” In this case, the attackers knew\nthe exact convention that their target used and searched for all of the servers in the geographic\narea where their targeted data was located.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\ndirecting each of the servers that would be used to move data out of the\ncompany to access a large video file (over 20MB) from an internal server\nnot otherwise targeted or involved in the overall operation. In each case,\nthe connection was terminated by the attackers after receiving only a short\nportion of the video. This truncated downloading suggest they were not\nattempting to view the contents of the file itself, but likely testing the\navailable bandwidth for transporting large volumes of data.\n\nThe attackers, operating with a valid user account, controlled one of the company’s\ndesktop machines which they used as a C2 node to direct the multiple servers\ninvolved in the overall exfiltration operation (the company’s analysts identified a\ntotal of four desktop machines used as C2 nodes). This particular C2 node\nconnected to multiple internal servers, including one staging server, two other\nknown intermediate hosts, and an external IP address located in the United States.\n\n  - One of the internal C2 hosts established a connection to a DSL customer of\na commercial US-based Internet service provider. This proxy connection\nremained open for the entire exfiltration phase. During that time, this node\nconnected via RDP into at least eight external hosts, one of which was\nlocated in Hong Kong.[108]\n\n  - Forensic analysis of the traffic flow in this incident indicates that the\nattackers moved large volumes of data from the staging servers to those\nused as a forwarding point for exfiltration out of the company’s networks\n(the connection between “Exfiltration Hosts” and “External Drop Points”\nFigure 7).\n\nThe Team One operators responsible for penetrating the information security\ndefenses possibly rehearsed their portion of the operation using innocuous files\nprior to actually commencing the data exfiltration, then attempted to send three\nRAR archive files via independent FTP sessions.\n\nAnalysis of the operators’ command channel activity indicates that they\nencountered serious problems with two external hosts intended to receive data\nexfiltrated from this company’s network. They also attempted custom FTP client\nand server software, but it failed for unknown reasons. The operators abandoned\none of these servers and the custom FTP software, likely due to the slow and\nunreliable data transfer rates, and continued with standard FTP server software\nrunning on five more reliable remote hosts for the remainder of the data exfiltration.\n\n108 The Hong Kong connection was unsuccessful and probably accidental given the careful steps\ntaken to use US-based servers to receive the data once it started flowing. The probable accident\ndoes potentially identify one of the adversary’s external resources, possibly used to receive data\nfrom the US servers once the operation was complete.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n  - On the final day of the operation, at approximately the same time in the\nevening that they started each day previously, the operators established an\nFTP connection from one of the internal exfiltration servers to an external\nhost. They verified that their communication channel was working properly\nby uploading a zero byte file followed by a much larger file. Apparently\nsatisfied that this connection functioned properly, the operators logged out\nof this internal server.\n\n  - The operators reconnected within half an hour to this same internal server,\nand using the same credentials attempted to move the first encrypted RAR\nfile containing the company’s proprietary data. Two minutes later, they\nattempted to move another file, and then logged out. Minutes later, they\nreconnected and attempted to move a third file. In each instance, the FTP\nconnections terminated prematurely for unknown reasons. It appears that\nwhile small file transfers were successful across this channel, large file\ntransfers caused it to fail.\n\n  - They then attempted to transfer files to a new remote FTP server using\ncustom FTP software that provided an additional layer of encryption. The\nattacker’s FTP software implemented a custom command, “SORT”, issued\nby the client and recognized by the server as a signal to receive encrypted\ncommunications in lieu of a normal, unencrypted, file transfer. This same\nsoftware was then tried almost immediately on a new remote host, and\nagain it failed to complete a test transfer. In a final test, they connected back\nto their first remote server which was now running their custom FTP server\nsoftware, and attempted a transfer; it too failed.\n\n  - They then connected to a second US university and succeeded in manually\nmoving large RAR files using unmodified FTP server software. Shortly\nthereafter, the operators established a series of automated, redundant,\ntransfers to five remote hosts, all running this same server software, in an\neffort to maximize the success rate of this main data exfiltration effort.\n\nThe information security staff eventually detected and blocked the exfiltration in\nmid-stream but not before significant amounts of company data left the network.\nIntrusion prevention systems on the company’s network were then tuned to alert\nand block further activity and for the next five hours these systems continued to\ndetect attempts by the operators to return, suggesting that they were interrupted\nbefore completing the full exfiltration as planned. Information security analysts with\nthis firm have no means of determining the total intended size of this exfiltration\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n## Timeline of Significant Chinese Related Cyber Events 1999-Present\n\n\n## 1999-Present\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n## Chronology of Alleged Chinese Computer Network Exploitation Events Targeting US and Foreign Networks\n\n#### 1999\n\nMay 1999: The accidental US bombing of China's Serbian embassy in May 1999\ndraws angry protest from China’s hacker community and leads to a series of\ndefacements of US government Websites by Chinese hackers.[109]\n\nAugust 1999: The “Taiwan-China Hacker War” erupts after then-President of\nTaiwan Lee Teng-hui recommended Taiwan’s relationship with the People’s\nRepublic of China be on a “state-to-state” basis.

Commonly the term is applied to people who attack\nothers using computers.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, hackers are subdivided as follows:\n\n- Script kiddies: Unskilled attackers who do not have the ability to discover new\nvulnerabilities or write exploit code, and are dependent on the research and\ntools from others. Their goal is achievement. Their sub-goals are to gain\naccess and deface web pages.\n\n- Worm and virus writers: Attackers who write the propagation code used in the\nworms and viruses but not typically the exploit code used to penetrate the\nsystems infected. Their goal is notoriety. Their sub-goals are to cause\ndisruption of networks and attached computer systems.\n\n- Security researchers and white hat operators: This group has two subcategories: bug hunters and exploit coders. Their goal is profit. Their subgoals are to improve security and achieve recognition with an exploit.\n\n- Professional hacker-black hat: Individuals who get paid to write exploits or\nactually penetrate networks; this group also falls into the same two subcategories as above. Their goal is also profit (See: http://www.uscert.gov/control_systems/csthreats.html).\n\n**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) – The message format and exchange**\nstandard used by web browsers and web servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n**Hacktivism – Computer hacking intended to communicate a social or political**\nmessage, or to support the position of a political or ideological group.

Phishing attacks generally involve an\nemail claiming to come from a trusted entity such as a bank or ecommerce\nvendor, with a link to a website and the instructions to click the link and take\nactions once at the website.\n\n**RAR or Roshal Archive - A compressed file format similar in use to the more**\npopular ZIP format. It is used to conserve storage and network resources and\nsimplifies the movement of large sets of files. Optional encryption is available\nusing the NIST Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. Just as ZIP archives\nare created with software such as WinZip (http://www.winzip.com) and zip\n(http://www.info-zip.org), RAR archives are created with WinRar and RAR\n(http://www.rarlab.com)\n\n**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - The communication protocol used to provide**\nremote viewing and control of Microsoft Windows computers and applications.\nFor additional information (See http://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/aa383015(VS.85).aspx).\n\n**Rootkit - A piece of software that can be installed and hidden on the victim**\ncomputer without the user’s knowledge. It may be included in a larger software\npackage or installed by an attacker who has been able to take advantage of\nvulnerability on the victim machine. Rootkits are not necessarily malicious, but\nthey may hide malicious activities. Attackers may be able to access information,\nmonitor user actions, modify programs, or perform other functions on the\ntargeted computer without being detected (See: http://www.uscert.gov/cas/tips/ST06-001.html).\n\n**Security Event and Information Management (SEIM) – Centralized collection**\nand management of security event records from many different systems such\nas firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus software, authentication systems, etc. SEIMs\nmay provide complex multifactor rules to alert on patterns of behavior not easily\nidentifiable by one of the component systems alone.\n\n**Spearphishing – A targeted phishing attack against a select group of victims,**\nusually belonging to a single company, school, industry, etc. “Spearphishing” is\ncommonly used to refer to any targeted email attack, not limited to phishing.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n**Trojan horse - An apparently useful program containing hidden functions that can**\nexploit the privileges of the user (running the program), with a resulting security\nthreat. A Trojan horse does things that the program user did not intend. Trojan\nhorses rely on users to install them, or they can be installed by intruders who\nhave gained unauthorized access by other means. Then, an intruder\nattempting to subvert a system using a Trojan horse relies on other users\nrunning the Trojan horse to be successful (See: www.cert.org/advisories/CA1999-02.html).\n\n**Tunneling - A technique to encapsulate one communication data stream inside of**\nanother, in order to extend the advantages of the latter to the former. Attackers\nwill often tunnel a network protocol that would not be allowed to cross network\nboundaries inside of another that is allowed, defeating perimeter defenses\n(See: http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/_tunneling.html).\n\n**Two-factor Authentication (T-FA) - Existing authentication methodologies involve**\nthree basic “factors”:\n\n  - Something the user knows (e.g., password, PIN);\n\n  - Something the user has (e.g., ATM card, smart card); and\n\n  - Something the user is (e.g., biometric characteristic, such as a fingerprint).\nT-FA requires that a user present two of the three possible factors to the\nauthentication mechanism. A known flaw in some T-FA systems is the server\nstorage of a hash representation of the credentials contained on the smart card\nor token. With this in hand, the attacker can replay that data to the\nauthentication system; in this case, that of the proxy server, without needing the\nphysical card or token (See:\nhttp://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/authentication_guidance.pdf).\n\n**USPACOM – United States Pacific Command is one of six Unified Combatant**\nCommands of the United States Armed Forces with an area of responsibility\nencompassing all territory from the US West Coast to the western border of\nIndia, and from Antarctica to the North Pole. The command presently has\napproximately 325,000 US service personnel.\n\n**USTRANSCOM - United States Transportation Command provides intermodal**\ntransportation across the spectrum of military operations. USTRANSCOM is\ncomprised of three component commands -- the Air Force's Air Mobility\nCommand, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, and the Army's Military\nSurface Deployment and Distribution Command.\n\n**Zero day exploit – An attack against a software vulnerability that has not yet been**\naddressed by the software maintainers. These attacks are difficult to defend\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\nagainst as they are often undisclosed by the vendor until a fix is available,\nleaving victims unaware of the exposure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to**\n**Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation**\n\n## Bibliography\n\nAnderson, Robert H, Feldman, Phillip M., et al., Securing the U.S. Defense\n_Information Infrastructure, RAND Corp., 1999._\n\nAning, Jerome and Olchondra, Riza T., RP Gov’t Websites Vulnerable to Hacking,\n_Philippine Daily Inquirer, March 31, 2009,_\nhttp://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20090331-197122/RP-govtwebsites-vulnerable-to-hacking#\n\nAsian News International, “French Embassy Website in China Hacked,” ZeeNews,\nDecember 12, 2008, http://www.zeenews.com/news490316.html\n\nAsiaPulse News, “China-Based Hackers Access S.
