The\ncore of the CozyDuke toolset is a modular attack platform\nconsisting of a main component augmented by a set of\nadditional modules implementing further functionality.\nThe CozyDuke toolset also includes multiple kinds\nof droppers for infecting hosts with CozyDuke or for\nexecuting additional tools from the CozyDuke toolset.\nFinally, the CozyDuke toolset includes tools and scripts –\nsome custom-written, others based on openly available\ntools – that are used for purposes such as gathering\nfurther information from infected hosts or for infecting\nadditional hosts in the same target organization.\n\n#### ATTACK OVERVIEW\n\n##### Infection vector\n\nWe have observed CozyDuke being spread via email,\nwhich usually contain a link to a compromised website\nhosting a ZIP file (although in at least one case, the file was\nhosted on Dropbox). These files contain an executable\nthat, upon execution, will write to disk and execute\nCozyDuke, while at the same time presenting the user\nwith a decoy to divert attention. The decoy is usually an\nuninteresting PDF, but we have also observed a Flash\nvideo of monkeys being presented as the decoy.\n\n\n###### Target details\n\nWe have reason to believe CozyDuke is being used to\ntarget governmental organizations and entities that work\nclosely with such bodies.\n\n###### Timeline\n\nWe believe the current CozyDuke activity started at\nthe end of January 2015. Most of the samples we have\nobserved were compiled beginning from the end of\nJanuary. However, based on comparisons of recent\nCozyDuke samples against older samples we have\nobtained dating back as far as the end of 2011, we believe\nCozyDuke has been under active development since at\nleast 2011.\n\n###### Attribution & links\n\nWe have strong evidence suggesting the group using\nCozyDuke is the same as - or at the least shares command\nand control infrastructure with - the group or groups\nusing MiniDuke and OnionDuke. Firstly, a CozyDuke\nsample from February of 2012 attempts to contact\na C&C server at nostressjob.com. This domain has\npreviously been associated with known MiniDuke C&C\ninfrastructure. This same infrastructure has also been seen\nin use by OnionDuke. Secondly, we also have reason to\nbelieve CozyDuke has, in some instances, downloaded\nand executed droppers for DLL files reminiscent of\nOnionDuke. Specifically, the DLLs dropped have used file\nand export names also used by OnionDuke. Additionally,\nthe strings in the DLLs have been encrypted using the\nsame algorithm used by OnionDuke. This link is, however,\nnot as conclusive as the infrastructure overlap.\n\n\n**FIGURE 1: C&C INFRASTRUCTURE CONNECTIONS**\n**BETWEEN COZYDUKE, MINIDUKE AND ONIONDUKE**\n\n**CozyDuke** **MiniDuke** **OnionDuke**\n\nnostressjob.com grouptumbler.com overpict.com\n\npostmaster@grouptumbler.com **John Kasai**\n\n\n-----\n\n### TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n#### INITIAL INFECTION\n\nInfection with CozyDuke begins with the victim receiving\nan email containing a link to a ZIP file. This ZIP file will\ncontain a single executable, usually a self-extracting RAR\narchive. Upon execution, it will write two files to disk.\nThe first file is a decoy. The decoy has usually been a PDF\ndocument but Flash videos have also been observed in\nsome cases. The second file extracted from the archive is\na CozyDuke dropper. This dropper will then proceed to\nwrite to disk the main CozyDuke components as well as an\nencrypted configuration file used by CozyDuke.\n\n**FIGURE 2: THE COZYDUKE INFECTION FLOW**\n\nZIP file\n\nMalicious link\n\nDownloads\n\n\n#### 3\n\n COZYDUKE MAIN DROPPER\n\nThe main CozyDuke dropper, used for infecting hosts\nwith CozyDuke, begins by checking whether the victim\nhas an anti-virus product installed. Should an installed\nproduct be found, it will be compared to a predetermined\nlist of product names. If the installed product matches\na name on the list, the dropper will immediately exit.\nNewer versions of the dropper will perform additional\nchecks to ensure the dropper is not being executed inside\na virtual machine or a known malware analysis sandbox\nenvironment. Should either of these checks fail, the\ndropper will likewise exit immediately.\n\nNext, the dropper will find and decrypt encrypted data\nstored as two PE resources embedded in the executable.\nThese resources are named with the hexadecimal\nidentifiers 0x000A and 0x000B. Both resources are\nstructured similarily. They begin with a four-byte value\nspecifying the length of the included decryption key.\nThis decryption key immediately follows the length field.\nFinally, the rest of the resource is the encrypted payload.\nThe encryption used is a simple XOR with a rotating key.\n\nThe first resource, 0x000A, contains as its payload a\nMicrosoft cabinet archive. This archive contains the\nCozyDuke components that the dropper will later install\non the victim system. The second resource, 0x000B,\ncontains as its payload an XML file with instructions for the\ndropper on where to install the dropped components and\nwhat to name them.\n\nThe dropper will then proceed to write the CozyDuke\ncomponents to the specified location. The dropper\nwill additionally copy the system file rundll32.exe to the\ninstall location for CozyDuke. This file will also use a name\nspecified in the droppers configuration file. Finally, the\ndropper will use the copy of rundll32.exe to load and\nexecute the CozyDuke main component.\n\n\nZIP file\n\n\nExtracts\n\nSelf-extracting\nRAR\n\nExtracts Extracts\n\nCozyDuke main dropper Decoy document\n\nEncrypted CozyDuke\nconfiguration components\nfile\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 4\n\n COZYDUKE MAIN COMPONENT\n\n###### Overview\n\nThe main component of CozyDuke is a DLL file\nresponsible for orchestrating all of CozyDuke’s activity on\na victim machine. The main component is executed by\nthe CozyDuke dropper using a copy of rundll32.exe. The\nentrypoint function varies, but is always specified in the\ndropper configuration.\n\nThe most important functionalities offered by the main\ncomponent are establishment of persistence, gathering\nof basic system information, communication with the C&C\nserver and the execution of additional tasks, modules or\nexecutables as commanded by the C&C server.\n\n###### Persistence\n\nCozyDuke may use multiple techniques for establishing\npersistence; the following is one technique used. Firstly,\nCozyDuke may set itself to be executed at system startup\nby adding a registry value under any of the following\nregistry keys:\n\n - HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\nCurrentVersion\\Run\\\n\n - HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\nCurrentVersion\\Run\\\n\n\n\n - HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\nCurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\n\n - HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\nCurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\n\nThe name of the registry value will usually be the\nfilename, (without the extension) of the CozyDuke main\ncomponent.\n\nCozyDuke may also register itself as a Windows service\nor scheduled task. Additionally, CozyDuke may\nutilize a technique known as COM-object hijacking\n\n[1] to establish persistence. To achieve this, CozyDuke\nwill “hijack” the registry entries for the COM object\n“SharedTaskScheduler”. CozyDuke will modify the\nregistry entries in such a way that any loading of the\nSharedTaskScheduler COM object will first load a special\nCozyDuke module that will ensure CozyDuke stays active\non the victim host.\n\n###### Configuration data\n\nThe configuration data for CozyDuke is stored as a\nseparate RC4-encrypted file that is written to disk by the\nCozyDuke dropper during initial infection. The name of\nthe encrypted configuration file on disk has been racss.\ndat in all of the observed cases. The decrypted file is\nformatted as XML with the UTF-16LE character encoding.\n\n\n**FIGURE 3: SCREENSHOT OF A DECRYPTED COZYDUKE CONFIGURATION FILE**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 5\n\n\n**TABLE 1: DETAILS OF KNOWN COZYDUKE C&C SERVERS**\n\n**Dropper SHA1** **Protocol** **Domain/IP**\n\n75aeaee253b5c8ae701195e3b0f49308f3d1d932 HTTP www.sanjosemaristas. com\n\n75aeaee253b5c8ae701195e3b0f49308f3d1d932 HTTP www.cifss. org\n\n446daabb7ac2b9f11dc1267fbd192628cc2bac19 HTTP pvt.relance.fr\n\n87668d14910c1e1bb8bbea0c6363f76e664dcd09 HTTPS 200.119.128.45\n\n87668d14910c1e1bb8bbea0c6363f76e664dcd09 HTTPS 202.206.232.20\n\nea0cfe60a7b7168c42c0e86e15feb5b0c9674029 HTTPS www.getiton.hants. org.uk\n\nf2ffc4e1d5faec0b7c03a233524bb78e44f0e50b HTTPS www.seccionpolitica. com.ar\n\n9b56155b82f14000f0ec027f29ff20e6ae5205c2 HTTPS 200.125.133.28\n\n9b56155b82f14000f0ec027f29ff20e6ae5205c2 HTTPS 200.125.142.11\n\nbf265227f9a8e22ea1c0035ac4d2449ceed43e2b HTTPS 203.156.161.49\n\n32b0c8c46f8baaba0159967c5602f58dd73ebde9 HTTPS 209.40.72.2\n\n78e9960cc5819583fb98fb619b33bff7768ee861 HTTPS 210.59.2.20\n\n78e9960cc5819583fb98fb619b33bff7768ee861 HTTPS 121.193.130.170\n\nce9d077349638ffd3e1ad68cda76c12cfb024069 HTTPS 208.75.241.246\n\nac2b5928f46069111f4334f650a7dbf1b5f026d5 HTTPS 183.78.169.5\n\nac2b5928f46069111f4334f650a7dbf1b5f026d5 HTTPS 201.76.51.10\n\nbf9d3a45273608caf90084c1157de2074322a230 HTTPS 208.77.177.24\n\nNote: Domain names intentionally broken\n\n|Dropper SHA1|Protocol|Domain/IP|Path|Port|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|75aeaee253b5c8ae701195e3b0f49308f3d1d932|HTTP|www.sanjosemaristas. com|/app/index.php|80|\n|75aeaee253b5c8ae701195e3b0f49308f3d1d932|HTTP|www.cifss. org|/product_thumb/index.php|80|\n|446daabb7ac2b9f11dc1267fbd192628cc2bac19|HTTP|pvt.relance.fr|/catalogue/json/index.php|80|\n|87668d14910c1e1bb8bbea0c6363f76e664dcd09|HTTPS|200.119.128.45|/mobile.php|443|\n|87668d14910c1e1bb8bbea0c6363f76e664dcd09|HTTPS|202.206.232.20|/rss.php|443|\n|ea0cfe60a7b7168c42c0e86e15feb5b0c9674029|HTTPS|www.getiton.hants. org.uk|/themes/front/img/ajax.php|80|\n|f2ffc4e1d5faec0b7c03a233524bb78e44f0e50b|HTTPS|www.seccionpolitica. com.ar|/galeria/index.php|80|\n|9b56155b82f14000f0ec027f29ff20e6ae5205c2|HTTPS|200.125.133.28|/search.php|443|\n|9b56155b82f14000f0ec027f29ff20e6ae5205c2|HTTPS|200.125.142.11|/news.php|443|\n|bf265227f9a8e22ea1c0035ac4d2449ceed43e2b|HTTPS|203.156.161.49|/plugins/twitter.php|443|\n|32b0c8c46f8baaba0159967c5602f58dd73ebde9|HTTPS|209.40.72.2|/plugins/fsearch.php|443|\n|78e9960cc5819583fb98fb619b33bff7768ee861|HTTPS|210.59.2.20|/search.php|443|\n|78e9960cc5819583fb98fb619b33bff7768ee861|HTTPS|121.193.130.170|/wp-ajax.php|443|\n|ce9d077349638ffd3e1ad68cda76c12cfb024069|HTTPS|208.75.241.246|/msearch.php|443|\n|ac2b5928f46069111f4334f650a7dbf1b5f026d5|HTTPS|183.78.169.5|/search.php|443|\n|ac2b5928f46069111f4334f650a7dbf1b5f026d5|HTTPS|201.76.51.10|/plugins/json.php|443|\n|bf9d3a45273608caf90084c1157de2074322a230|HTTPS|208.77.177.24|/fsearch.php|443|\n\n\nIn all CozyDuke samples from 2015, the configuration\ndata has been encrypted with the RC4 key B5 78 62 52 98\n3E 24 D7 3B C6 EE 7C B9 ED 91 62. In CozyDuke samples\nfrom July of 2014, the RC4 key has been embedded in the\nencrypted configuration file. In this case, the encrypted\nconfiguration file will begin with a 4-byte value specifying\nthe length of the included RC4 key. This will be followed\nby the actual key. Finally, the rest of the file will be the\nactual configuration data.\n\n###### Command and control communication\n\nCozyDuke’s main method of communicating with its\ncommand and control server is using either HTTP or\nHTTPS. The method of communication, as well as the\naddress to connect to, are specified in CozyDuke’s\nconfiguration data. In the cases we have observed, the\nconfiguration data for any single CozyDuke instance has\nincluded the details of either one or two C&C servers.\nListed above are details of known CozyDuke C&C servers.\nWe believe all of the ones listed are compromised servers.\n\n**REFERENCE**\n\n\nIn addition to its main communication method,\nCozyDuke also features the ability to use Twitter as a\nbackup C&C channel. In cases where CozyDuke utilizes\nthis functionality, the twitter account to be used will be\nspecified in CozyDuke’s configuration data. We have only\nobserved two samples where a backup Twitter account\nwas actually specified in the configuration data. These\naccounts were @US2515 and @monkey_drive.\n\n###### Tasks\n\nCozyDuke’s primary purpose is the execution of tasks.\nThese tasks usually involve the execution of modules or\nexecutables providing additional functionality. The main\ndifference between the two is that modules are DLL files\nloaded in memory by the CozyDuke main component,\nwhereas executables are PE executable files that\nCozyDuke will write to disk and execute.\n\nFor the purpose of managing tasks, the main component\nof CozyDuke implements 6 commands that the C&C\nserver can specify. These commands are briefly described\nin Table 2 (overleaf).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 6\n\n**TABLE 2: 6 COZYDUKE**\n**C&C SERVER COMMANDS**\n\n**Command** **Purpose**\nAdd Add task\nDelete Delete task\nStop Stop task\nModify Modify task or configuration\nUpload Upload data\nDownload Download data\n\nThe following chapter, CozyDuke Tasks, provides further\ninformation on the tasks CozyDuke has been observed\nexecuting.\n\n#### COZYDUKE TASKS\n\nBased on samples obtained from our own collections\nand generously shared to us by a trusted source, we\nhave been able to identify some of the tasks executed\nrecently by CozyDuke. These tasks can be divided into\ntwo categories. The first consists of CozyDuke modules\nwhich are DLL files loaded in memory by the main\ncomponent of CozyDuke for the purposes of extending\nCozyDuke’s functionality. The second category consists\nof PE executable files that CozyDuke will write to disk\nand execute on the infected host. These executables are\nusually droppers similar to those used to infect a host\nwith CozyDuke. In this case, however, instead of dropping\nCozyDuke, the executables may drop other executables,\nscripts or DLLs. Once executed by CozyDuke, these\nexecutables function independently of CozyDuke’s main\ncomponent.\n\n###### Modules\n\nListed below are the modules we have observed being\nused:\n\n**TABLE 3: COZYDUKE MODULES**\n\n\n###### Executables\n\nWe have observed executables executed by CozyDuke for\nthe following purposes:\n\n  - Dropping and executing scripts for collecting\ninformation and credentials from the victim\norganization’s Active Directory environment\n\n  - Dropping and executing scripts for further\npenetrating the victim organization with the help\nof commonly available tools such as Mimikatz and\nPSExec\n\n  - Dropping and executing additional malware with\nthe same file and export naming conventions\nas OnionDuke and the same string encryption\nalgorithm as OnionDuke\n\nThese executables will implement their own methods of\nC&C communication and data exfiltration. In many cases,\nthe scripts utilized Microsoft OneDrive accounts for data\ntransfer.\n\n#### COZYDUKE EVOLUTION\n\nThe earliest CozyDuke sample we have observed so far\nwas compiled on the 29[th] of December, 2011. The sample\nin question was not an actual CozyDuke main component,\nbut a CozyDuke module. The earliest main component\nwe observed was compiled on the 29[th] of February, 2012.\nThe main component in question stores its strings and\nconfiguration in an unencrypted form. Additionally, the\nconfiguration is stored embedded in the binary, not as\na separate XML file in the manner of newer CozyDuke\nversions. Even this oldest main component does however\nuse XML for other purposes via the open-source Pugi-XML\nlibrary.\n\nThe next CozyDuke main component we observed\nwas compiled on the 30[th] of November, 2012. By then,\nthe authors had switched to encrypting the strings\nand the configuration. However, the configuration\nwas still stored embedded in the binary. Design-wise,\nthis sample is a bit of an outlier. Instead of being a DLL\nfile, the main component is actually an EXE that, in\naddition to the configuration, embeds multiple DLLs that\nprovide additional functionality to the main component.\nApart from the different design, functionally the main\ncomponent is very similar to other CozyDuke main\ncomponents. It is possible the authors of CozyDuke were\ntrying out a new design, but eventually decided to go\nback to the original.\n\nThe next CozyDuke main component we observed,\ncompiled on the 2[nd] of July, 2014, is again a DLL file.\nBy now, the authors of CozyDuke had switched from\n\n|Command|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|Add|Add task|\n|Delete|Delete task|\n|Stop|Stop task|\n|Modify|Modify task or configuration|\n|Upload|Upload data|\n|Download|Download data|\n\n|Module Type|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|Command execution module|Can be used to execute arbitrary commands by invoking C:\\ Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe|\n|Password stealer module|Will attempt to harvest stored credentials from the victim|\n|NTLM stealer module|Will attempt to harvest credentials stored on the victim host that are used as part of Windows NTLM user authentication|\n|System info module|Will attempt to gather comprehensive information on the victim host’s configuration|\n|Screenshot module|Will take a screenshot of the victim host|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 7\n\n\n**FIGURE 4: TIMELINE OF COZYDUKE EVOLUTION**\n\n\nan embedded configuration to the external XMLformatted configuration file seen today. We have yet to\nobserve samples from 2013, but we believe CozyDuke to\nhave been under active development as well during that\nyear. Between 2012 and 2014, the authors of CozyDuke\nappear to have performed significant refactoring of\nthe CozyDuke codebase, even though functionally the\ndifferences are smaller. Examples of this refactoring\ninclude for instance the switch from using the Pugi-XML\nlibrary to using Microsoft’s MSXML 3.0 for XML-related\nfunctionality.\n\nThe latest CozyDuke main component we observed\nwas compiled on the 26[th] of February, 2015. The core\nfunctionality of the latest sample is very similar to the\nprevious sample from July of 2014, but the authors\nof CozyDuke have implemented a lot of additional\nfunctionality, as the increase in size from 279KB to 820KB\nwould also suggest.\n\n\n#### COZYDUKE TERMINOLOGY AND NAMING\n\nBased on logging strings, variable naming and PDB strings\nfound in CozyDuke samples, we observed the following:\n\n  - The internal name for CozyDuke is “Agent”\n\n - The CozyDuke main component’s functionality\nrevolves around the execution of “tasks” that are\noften associated with “modules”\n\n  - It is possible that the name “Agent” is not the\noriginal internal name of CozyDuke and that the\nname was changed sometime in 2011 with the\noriginal project name being “Agent_NextGen”\n\n  - Sometime in 2011, CozyDuke was identified\ninternally as being version 3\n\nPDB strings found in early CozyDuke samples are listed in\nTable 4 (below).\n\n|Col1|TABLE 4: COZYDUKE PDB STRINGS|\n|---|---|\n|Compilation timestamp|PDB string|\n|Mon Feb 13 13:07:04 2012 (UTC)|E:\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\Agent_NextGen\\Agent2011v3\\Agent2011\\Agent\\tasks\\bin\\ GetPasswords\\exe\\GetPasswords.pdb|\n|Wed Dec 28 13:23:04 2011 (UTC)|D:\\Projects\\Agent2011\\Agent2011\\Agent\\tasks\\bin\\systeminfo\\exe\\systeminfo.pdb|\n|Thu Jan 26 13:57:00 2012 (UTC)|\\\\192.168.56.101\\true\\soft\\Agent\\tasks\\Screenshots\\agent_screeshots\\Release\\agent_ screeshots.pdb|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 8\n\n### APPENDIX A | SAMPLE HASHES\n\n -
