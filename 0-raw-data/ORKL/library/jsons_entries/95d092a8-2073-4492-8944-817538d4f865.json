They have today been\nindicted by the FBI for targeting the systems controlling the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant\nin Kansas, US in 2017 but failed to have any negative impact.\n\nSeparately, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has used the UK’s cyber sanctions regime to\ndesignate a Russian defence ministry subsidiary, the Central Scientific Research Institute of\nChemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM), for an incident involving safety override controls in a\nSaudi petro-chemicals plant in 2017.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss said:\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia s targeting of critical national infrastructure is calculated and dangerous. It\nshows Putin is prepared to risk lives to sow division and confusion among allies.\n\nWe are sending a clear message to the Kremlin by sanctioning those who target\npeople, businesses and infrastructure. We will not tolerate it.\n\nWe will continue to work together with our allies to turn the ratchet and starve Putin’s\nwar machine of its funding and resources.\n\nThe malware used against the petro-chemical plant was designed specifically to target the\nplant’s safety override for the Industrial Control System and resulted in 2 emergency\nshutdowns of the plant.\n\nThe malware was designed to give the actors complete control of infected systems and had\nthe capability to cause significant impact, possibly including the release of toxic gas or an\nexplosion - either of which could have resulted in loss of life and physical damage to the\nfacility.\n\nThe FSB’s long raft of malign cyber activity includes:\n\ntargeting UK energy companies\nsustained and substantial scanning and probing of networks in the American aviation\nsector, and exfiltration of data in aviation and other key US targets\nposing as the Russian Federal Tax Service to conduct spear-phishing attacks against\nRussian nationals\nattempting to spear-phish the press secretary of Mikhail Khodorkovskiy, a UK-based\nlongstanding critic of the Kremlin, and monitoring a website he set up to expose\ncorruption in the Russian government\n\nThese [sanctions follow a further 65 oligarchs and banks targeted earlier today by the Foreign](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-announces-65-new-russian-sanctions-to-cut-off-vital-industries-fuelling-putins-war-machine)\nSecretary, bringing the UK’s sanctions on those who enable Putin’s war to more than £500\nbillion worth of bank assets and £150 billion in personal net worth.\n\n## Background\n\n[Factsheet detailing key malign activity that the UK is attributing to the Russian state](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russias-fsb-malign-cyber-activity-factsheet)\n‘spear-phishing’ is the practice of sending targeted electronic communication, such as\nemails and SMS messages, to specific individuals, groups or organisations for\nmalicious purposes, including data theft, espionage and fraud\n\nMedia enquiries\n\n[Email newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk)\n\nTelephone 020 7008 3100\n\n\n-----\n\nContact the FCDO Communication Team via email (monitored 24 hours a day) in the first\ninstance, and we will respond as soon as possible.\n\n\n-----",
