    "plain_text": "## 26 January 2022  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential\n\n_use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. This data is provided to help_\n_cyber security professionals and system administrators guard against the persistent malicious actions_\n\nPIN Number _of cyber actors. This PIN was coordinated with DHS/CISA._\n\n_This PIN has been released TLP:WHITE_\n\n### PIN-20220126-001\n\n\n## Please contact the FBI with any questions related to this Private Industry\n Notification via your local FBI Cyber Squad.\n\n### www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\n\n# Context and Recommendations to Protect Against Malicious Activity by Iranian Cyber Group Emennet Pasargad\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Private Industry Notice provides a historical overview of Iran-based cyber company Emennet Pasargad’s\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to enable recipients to identify and defend against the group’s\nmalicious cyber activities. On 20 October 2021, a grand jury in the US District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York indicted two Iranian nationals employed by Emennet Pasargad (formerly known as Eeleyanet\nGostar) for computer intrusion, computer fraud, voter intimidation, interstate threats, and conspiracy offenses\nfor their alleged participation in a multi-faceted campaign aimed at influencing and interfering with the 2020\nUS Presidential Election. In addition, the Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control\ndesignated Emennet along with four members of the company’s management and the two indicted\nemployees for attempting to influence the same election. The Department of State’s Rewards for Justice\nProgram also offered up to $10 million for information on the two indicted actors.\n\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat\n\nStarting in August 2020, Emennet Pasargad actors conducted a multi-faceted campaign to interfere in the\n2020 US presidential election. As part of this campaign, the actors obtained confidential U.S. voter information\nfrom at least one state election website; sent threatening email messages to intimidate voters; created and\ndisseminated a video containing disinformation pertaining to purported but non-existent voting\nvulnerabilities; attempted to access, without authorization, several states’ voting-related websites; and\nsuccessfully gained unauthorized access to a U.S. media company’s computer network. During the 2020\nelection interference campaign, the actors claimed affiliation with the Proud Boys in the voter intimidation\nand disinformation aspects of the campaign.\n\nIn addition to the 2020 U.S. election-focused operation in which the actors masqueraded as members of the\nProud Boys, Emennet previously conducted cyber-enabled information operations, including operations that\nused a false-flag persona. According to FBI information, in late 2018, the group masqueraded as the \"Yemen\nCyber Army\" and crafted messaging critical of Saudi Arabia. Emennet also demonstrated interest in leveraging\nbulk SMS services, likely as a means to mass-disseminate propaganda or other messaging.\n\nFBI information indicates Emennet poses a broader cybersecurity threat outside of information operations.\nSince 2018, Emennet has conducted traditional cyber exploitation activity targeting several sectors, including\nnews, shipping, travel (hotels and airlines), oil and petrochemical, financial, and telecommunications, in the\nUnited States, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\n## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nThe FBI is providing a summary of the group's past TTPs to recipients so they can better understand and\ndefend against the group’s future malicious activity.\n\nEmennet is known to use Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to obfuscate the origin of their activity. The\ngroup likely uses VPN services including TorGuard, CyberGhost, NordVPN, and Private Internet Access.\n\nOver the past three years, Emennet conducted reconnaissance and chose potential victims by performing web\nsearches for leading businesses in various sectors such as “top American news sites.” Emennet would then use\nthese results to scan websites for vulnerable software that could be exploited to establish persistent access. In\nsome instances, the objective may have been to exploit a large number of networks/websites in a particular\nsector as opposed to a specific organization target. In other situations, Emennet would also attempt to identify\nhosting/shared hosting services.\n\nAfter the initial reconnaissance phase, Emennet typically researched how to exploit specific software,\nincluding identifying open source available tools. In particular, Emennet demonstrated interest in identifying\nwebpages running PHP code and identifying externally accessible mysql databases (in particular,\nphpMyAdmin). Emennet also demonstrated an interest in exploiting the below software applications:\n\n  - Wordpress (in particular the revslider and layerslider plugins)\n\n  - Drupal\n\n  - Apache Tomcat\n\n  - Ckeditor and Fckeditor (including the exploitation of Roxy Fileman)\n\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n\n-----\n\nEmennet also expressed interest in numerous specific vulnerabilities, outlined in Appendix A.\n\nWhen conducting research, Emennet attempted to identify default passwords for particular applications a\ntarget may be using, and tried to identify admin and/or login pages associated with those same targeted\nwebsites. It should be assumed Emennet may attempt common plaintext passwords for any login sites they\nidentify.\n\nEmennet is known to use the open source penetration testing tools SQLmap and the commercially available\ntool Acunetix during operational activity. They also likely use the below tools or resources:\n\n  - DefenseCode Web Security Scanner\n\n  - Wappalyzer\n\n  - Dnsdumpster\n\n  - Tiny mce scanner\n\n  - Netsparker\n\n  - Wordpress security scanner (wpscan)\n\n  - Shodan\n\nFBI information indicates the group has attempted to leverage cyber intrusions conducted by other actors for\ntheir own benefit. This includes searching for data hacked and leaked by other actors, and attempting to\nidentify webshells that may have been placed or used by other cyber actors.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n  - Ensure anti-virus and anti-malware software is enabled and signature definitions are updated regularly\n\nin a timely manner. Well-maintained anti-virus software may prevent use of commonly deployed\nattacker tools that are delivered via spear-phishing.\n\n  - Adopt threat reputation services at the network device, operating system, application, and email\n\nservice levels. Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low-reputation email addresses,\nfiles, URLs, and IP addresses used in spear-phishing attacks.\n\n  - If your organization’s information was previously compromised, the FBI recommends considering how\n\nany data exfiltrated could be leveraged to conduct further malicious activity against your network, and\ntake appropriate measures to ensure security mechanisms are in place.\n\n  - If your organization is employing certain types of software and appliances referenced in the\n\naforementioned CVEs, the FBI recommends patching for those vulnerabilities.\n\n  - Review the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures in the referenced table and take steps to ensure you\n\ncan identify and defend against malicious activity by this actor.\n\n  - Consider reputable hosting services for websites and content management systems (CMS), if you need\n\nassistance in configuring and maintaining your external facing applications.\n\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Consider employing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block inbound malicious traffic.\n\n  - Disable Content Management Systems features if they are not needed, and configure them to:\n\n`o` Disable remote file editing\n`o` Restrict file execution to specific directories\n`o` Limit login attempts\n\n  - Review the logs generated by security devices for signs that your organizations external networks are\n\nbeing scanned for vulnerabilities.\n\n## Reporting Notice\n\nThe FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or criminal\nactivity to their local FBI field office. Field office contacts can be identified at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/fieldoffices. When available, each report submitted should include the date, time, location, type of activity,\nnumber of people, and type of equipment used for the activity, the name of the submitting company or\norganization, and a designated point of contact.\n\nThe FBI also notes the Department of State’s Rewards for Justice Program is offering up to $10 million for\ninformation leading to the identification or location of Emennet-associated cyber actors Seyyed Mohammad\nHosein Musa Kazemi and Sajjad Kashian:\n\n  - https://rewardsforjustice.net/terrorist-rewards/seyyed-kazemi/\n\n  - https://rewardsforjustice.net/terrorist-rewards/sajjad-kashian/\n\n## Administrative Note\n\nThis product is marked TLP:WHITE.

This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2017-0214.|\n|CVE-2018-8639|An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory, aka \"Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability.\" This affects Windows 7, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 10, Windows 10 Servers. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2018-8641.|\n|CVE-2017-14723|Before version 4.8.2, WordPress mishandled % characters and additional placeholder values in $wpdb-> prepare, and thus did not properly address the possibility of plugins and themes enabling SQL injection attacks.|\n|CVE-2017-8295|WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset e-mail message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to reset arbitrary passwords by making a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this message to bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker- controlled SMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message.|\n|CVE-2017-14726|Before version 4.8.2, WordPress was vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack via shortcodes in the TinyMCE visual editor.|\n|CVE-2017-5611|SQL injection vulnerability in wp-includes/class-wp-query.php in WP_Query in WordPress before 4.7.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by leveraging the presence of an affected plugin or theme that mishandles a crafted post type name.|\n\n\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n\n-----\n\nZimbra Collaboration Suite before 8.6 patch 13, 8.7.x before 8.7.11 patch 10, and 8.8.x before 8.8.10 patch 7 or 8.8.x before\n\nCVE-2019-9621 8.8.11 patch 3 allows SSRF via the ProxyServelet componet.\n\nSource: National Vulnerability Database (nvd.nist.gov)\n\n#### TLP:WHITE\n\n|Col1|TLP:WHITE|\n|---|---|\n|CVE|Description|\n|CVE-2019-0044|Receipt of a specific packet on the out-of-band management interface fxp0 may cause the system to crash and restart (vmcore).
