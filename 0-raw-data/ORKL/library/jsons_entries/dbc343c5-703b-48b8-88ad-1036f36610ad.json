    "plain_text": "# Putin Warns Russian Critical Infrastructure to Brace for Potential Cyber Attacks\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/02/putin-warns-russian-critical.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/putin-warns-russian-critical.html)**\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\nThe Russian government on Thursday warned of cyber attacks aimed at domestic critical\ninfrastructure operators, as the country's full-blown invasion of Ukraine enters the second day.\n\nIn addition to cautioning of the \"threat of an increase in the intensity of computer attacks,\" Russia's\n[National Computer Incident Response and Coordination Center said that the \"attacks can be aimed](https://safe-surf.ru/specialists/news/675925/)\nat disrupting the functioning of important information resources and services, causing reputational\ndamage, including for political purposes.\"\n\n\"Any failure in the operation of [critical information infrastructure] objects due to a reason that is not\nreliably established, first of all, should be considered as the result of a computer attack,\" the agency\nadded.\n\nFurthermore, it notified of possible influence operations undertaken to \"form a negative image of the\nRussian Federation in the eyes of the world community,\" echoing a [similar alert released by the](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/us-cybersecurity-agency-publishes-list.html)\nU.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) last week about information\nmanipulation efforts from foreign actors to strike critical entities.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nThe agency, however, didn't share more specifics on the nature of the attacks or their provenance.\n\n[The advisory comes as multiple](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1496907105579814916) [government and](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1496878462690340865) [banking](https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1496904885455007749) [websites in Russia, including that of](https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1496961857638309893)\nmilitary (mil.ru), the Kremlin (kremlin.ru), and the State Duma (duma.gov.ru), were rendered\n[unreachable amid a spate of cyber offensives targeting Ukraine that resulted in the deployment of a](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1496775905192161280)\n[data wiper called](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/24/hermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine/) [HermeticWiper on hundreds of machines in the East European nation.](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-wiper-malware-targeting-ukraine.html)\n\n\"It's important to note that the wiper leverages high privileges on the compromised host to make the\nhost 'unbootable' by overriding the boot records and configurations, erase device configurations,\nand delete shadow copies,\" Lavi Lazarovitz, head of security research at CyberArk Labs, said in a\nstatement shared with The Hacker News.\n\n\"The wiper is configured to not encrypt domain controllers – that is to keep the domain running and\nallow the ransomware to use valid credentials to authenticate to servers and encrypt those. This\nfurther highlights that the threat actors use compromised identities to access the network and / or\nmove laterally,\" Lazarovitz elaborated.\n\nIt's not clear how many networks have been affected by the previously unseen data-wiping\nmalware, which targeted organizations in the financial, defense, aviation, and IT industries,\naccording to Symantec. The Broadcom-owned company also said it observed evidence of wiper\nattacks against machines in Lithuania, implying a spillover effect.\n\n[What's more, HermeticWiper shares overlaps with another data wiper called WhisperGate that was](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/a-new-destructive-malware-targeting.html)\nfirst reported as being used against Ukrainian organizations in January. Like the latter, the newly\ndiscovered malware is accompanied by the distribution of a ransomware strain on compromised\nsystems.\n\nThe [ransomware malware is a 64-bit, 3.14 MB .EXE file, written in Golang, per Cybereason's](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4dc13bb83a16d4ff9865a51b3e4d24112327c526c1392e14d56f20d6f4eaf382/detection)\nincident response engineer, [Chen Erlich, who shared a preliminary analysis of the executable.](https://twitter.com/chen_erlich/status/1496844075332509701)\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n\"It appears likely that the ransomware was used as a decoy or distraction from the wiper attacks,\"\nSymantec [said. \"This has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate wiper attacks against](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ukraine-wiper-malware-russia)\nUkraine, where the wiper was disguised as ransomware.\"\n\nInitial forensic analysis suggests that the attacks may have been in preparation mode for at least\nthree months, what with potentially related malicious activity detected in a Lithuanian organization\nas early as November 12, 2021. Also, one of the HermeticWiper samples was found to have a\ncompilation timestamp of December 28, 2021.\n\nWhile the latest disruptive actions are yet to be formally attributed, the U.K. and U.S. governments\n[linked the DDoS attacks on Ukraine in mid-February to Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (also](https://cip.gov.ua/en/news/shodo-kiberataki-na-saiti-viiskovikh-struktur-ta-derzhavnikh-bankiv)\nknown as GRU).\n\n\n-----\n\n[As the attacks continue to unfold both on the physical and digital realms, Reuters reported that the](https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-ukraine-calls-hacker-underground-defend-against-russia-2022-02-24/)\nUkrainian government is seeking the help of the underground hacker community in the country to\nfend off cyber infiltrations aimed at critical infrastructure and conduct covert espionage missions\nagainst the invading Russian forces.\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
