    "plain_text": "# RevengeHotels: cybercrime targeting hotel front desks worldwide\n\n**securelist.com/revengehotels/95229**\n\nBy GReAT\n\nRevengeHotels is a targeted cybercrime malware campaign against hotels, hostels, hospitality\nand tourism companies, mainly, but not exclusively, located in Brazil. We have confirmed more\nthan 20 hotels that are victims of the group, located in eight states in Brazil, but also in other\ncountries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, France, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain,\nThailand and Turkey. The goal of the campaign is to capture credit card data from guests and\ntravelers stored in hotel systems, as well as credit card data received from popular online travel\nagencies (OTAs) such as Booking.com.\n\nThe main attack vector is via email with crafted Word, Excel or PDF documents attached. Some\nof them exploit CVE-2017-0199, loading it using VBS and PowerShell scripts and then installing\ncustomized versions of RevengeRAT, NjRAT, NanoCoreRAT, 888 RAT and other custom\nmalware such as ProCC in the victim’s machine. The group has been active since 2015, but\nincreased its attacks in 2019.\n\nIn our research, we were also able to track two groups targeting the hospitality sector, using\n[separate but similar infrastructure, tools and techniques. PaloAlto has already written about one](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/operation-comando-or-how-to-run-a-cheap-and-effective-credit-card-business/)\nof them. We named the first group RevengeHotels, and the second ProCC. These groups use a\nlot of social engineering in their attacks, asking for a quote from what appears to be a government\nentity or private company wanting to make a reservation for a large number of people. Their\ninfrastructure also relies on the use of dynamic DNS services pointing to commercial hosting and\nself-hosted servers. They also sell credentials from the affected systems, allowing other\ncybercriminals to have remote access to hotel front desks infected by the campaign.\n\nWe monitored the activities of these groups and the new malware they are creating for over a\nyear. With a high degree of confidence, we can confirm that at least two distinct groups are\nfocused on attacking this sector; there is also a third group, though it is unclear if its focus is\nsolely on this sector or if carries out other types of attacks.\n\n## Not the quotation you’re expecting\n\nOne of the tactics used in operations by these groups is highly targeted spear-phishing\nmessages. They register typo-squatting domains, impersonating legitimate companies. The\nemails are well written, with an abundance of detail. They explain why the company has chosen\nto book that particular hotel. By checking the sender information, it’s possible to determine\nwhether the company actually exists. However, there is a small difference between the domain\nused to send the email and the real one.\n\n\n-----\n\n_An email sent to a hotel supposedly from an attorney’s office_\n\n\nThis spear-phishing message, written in Portuguese, has a malicious file attached misusing the\nname of a real attorney office, while the domain sender of the message was registered one day\nbefore, using a typo-squatting domain. The group goes further in its social engineering effort: to\nconvince the hotel personnel about the legitimacy of their request, a copy of the National Registry\nof Legal Entities card (CNPJ) is attached to the quotation.\n\nThe attached file, Reserva Advogados Associados.docx (Attorneys Associates\nReservation.docx), is a malicious Word file that drops a remote OLE object via template injection\nto execute macro code. The macro code inside the remote OLE document contains PowerShell\ncommands that download and execute the final payload.\n\n\n_PowerShell commands executed by the embedded macro_\n\n\nIn the RevengeHotels campaign, the downloaded files are .NET binaries protected with the Yoda\nObfuscator. After unpacking them, the code is recognizable as the commercial RAT RevengeRAT.\nAn additional module written by the group called ScreenBooking is used to capture credit card\ndata It monitors whether the user is browsing the web page In the initial versions back in 2016\n\n\n-----\n\nthe downloaded files from RevengeHotels campaigns were divided into two modules: a backdoor\nand a module to capture screenshots. Recently we noticed that these modules had been merged\ninto a single backdoor module able to collect data from clipboard and capture screenshots.\n\nIn this example, the webpage that the attacker is monitoring is booking.com (more specifically, the\npage containing the card details). The code is specifically looking for data in Portuguese and\nEnglish, allowing the attackers to steal credit card data from web pages written in these\nlanguages.\n\nIn the ProCC campaigns, the\ndownloaded files are Delphi\nbinaries. The backdoor installed in\nthe machine is more customized\nthan that used by RevengeHotels:\nit’s developed from scratch and is _Title searched by the malware in order to capture the screen_\nable to collect data from the _contents_\n**clipboard and printer spooler, and**\n**capture screenshots. Because the**\npersonnel in charge of confirming reservations usually need to pull credit card data from OTA\nwebsites, it’s possible to collect card numbers by monitoring the clipboard and the documents\nsent to the printer.\n\n\n_Screenshot is captured when the user copies something to the clipboard or makes a print_\n\n_request_\n\n\n-----\n\n## A bad guy’s concierge\n\nAccording to the relevant underground forums and messaging groups, these criminals also infect\nfront desk machines in order to capture credentials from the hotel administration software; they\ncan then steal credit card details from it too. Some criminals also sell remote access to these\nsystems, acting as a concierge for other cybercriminals by giving them permanent access to steal\nnew data by themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Access to hotel booking systems containing credit card details is sold by criminals as a service_\n\n\nSome Brazilian criminals tout credit card data extracted from a hotel’s system as high quality and\nreliable because it was extracted from a trusted source, i.e., a hotel administration system.\n\n\n_Message sent to an underground channel selling data extracted from hotel systems_\n\n\n## Guests and victims\n\nThe majority of the victims are associated with the hospitality sector. Based on the routines used,\nwe estimate that this attack has a global reach. However, based on our telemetry data, we can\nonly confirm victims in the following countries:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Victims confirmed in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, France, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain,_\n\n_Thailand and Turkey_\n\n\nBased on data extracted from Bit.ly statistics, we can see that potential victims from many other\ncountries have at least accessed the malicious link. This data suggests that the number of\ncountries with potential victims is higher than our telemetry has registered.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Victims per country based on data from a malicious Bit.ly link from the RevengeHotels campaign_\n\n\n## A safe stay\n\nRevengeHotels is a campaign that has been active since at least 2015, revealing different groups\nusing traditional RAT malware to infect businesses in the hospitality sector. While there is a\nmarked interest in Brazilian victims, our telemetry shows that their reach has extended to other\ncountries in Latin America and beyond.\n\nThe use of spear-phishing emails, malicious documents and RAT malware is yielding significant\nresults for at least two groups we have identified in this campaign. Other threat actors may also\nbe part of this wave of attacks, though there is no confirmation at the current time.\n\nIf you want to be a savvy and safe traveler, it’s highly recommended to use a virtual payment card\nfor reservations made via OTAs, as these cards normally expire after one charge. While paying\nfor your reservation or checking out at a hotel, it’s a good idea to use a virtual wallet such as\nApple Pay, Google Pay, etc. If this is not possible, use a secondary or less important credit card,\nas you never know if the system at the hotel is clean, even if the rooms are…\n\nAll Kaspersky products detect this threat as:\n\n#### HEUR:Backdoor.MSIL.Revenge.gen HEUR:Trojan-Downloader.MSIL.RevengeHotels.gen HEUR:Trojan.MSIL.RevengeHotels.gen HEUR:Trojan.Win32.RevengeHotels.gen HEUR:Trojan.Script.RevengeHotels.gen\n\n## Indicators of compromise (IoCs)\n\n### Reference hashes:\n\n74440d5d0e6ae9b9a03d06dd61718f66\ne675bdf6557350a02f15c14f386fcc47\ndf632e25c32e8f8ad75ed3c50dd1cd47\na089efd7dd9180f9b726594bb6cf81ae\n81701c891a1766c51c74bcfaf285854b\n\nFor a full list of IoCs as well as the YARA rules and intelligence report for this campaign, please\n[visit the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal: https://tip.kaspersky.com/](https://tip.kaspersky.com/)\n\n\n-----",
