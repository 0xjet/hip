It contains hidden files, an LNK file that initiates the\ninfection, and an executable file designed to unhide a decoy document while executing\n[Advanced Monitoring Agent, a remote administration tool.](https://www.n-able.com/features/advanced-monitoring-agent)\n\nThis is the first public report about MuddyWater utilizing this remote administration tool.\n\nThe Multi-stage Social Engineering Campaign\n\nWhile Deep Instinct could not verify the spreading mechanism of the new campaign, it most\nlikely starts with a spear-phishing email, similar to previous campaigns.\n\nThe content of the email lures the victim into downloading an archive hosted at\n“a.storyblok[.]com”\n\nIn this analysis, we examine the “defense-video.zip” file.\n\nWhen the archive is extracted, several folders must be navigated until a LNK shortcut, which\nlooks like another folder named “Attachments,” is found:\n\nFigure 2: LNK Shortcut\n\nHowever, there are additional hidden folders and files extracted from the archive:\n\nFigure 3: Hidden folders\n\nWhen the victim opens the LNK file, the infection chain starts.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy examining the LNK file, we can see that it executes an executable from one of the hidden\ndirectories:\n\nFigure 4: LNK command line arguments\n\nThe file “Diagnostic.exe” has been used in both archives Deep Instinct observed. The\npurpose of this file is to execute another executable called\n“Windows.Diagnostic.Document.EXE,” which is located in the hidden directory named “.end”\nunder a “Windows.Diagnostic.Document” hidden directory.\n\nThe file named “Windows.Diagnostic.Document.EXE” is a signed, legitimate installer for\n“Advanced Monitoring Agent.”\n\nIn addition to executing the remote administration tool, “Diagnostic.exe” also opens a new\nWindows Explorer window of the hidden “Document” folder. This is done to fool the victim\nthat opened the LNK file into thinking that it was indeed a folder.\n\nThe decoy document is an official memo from the Israeli Civil Service Commission, which\n[can be publicly downloaded from their website.](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/news/disciplinary-treatment-statements-against-israel-wartime-news)\n\nThe memo describes what to do in case a government worker expresses opinions against\nthe Israeli state on social networks:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Decoy document\n\nConclusion\n\nMuddyWater continues to attack Israeli targets in various ongoing campaigns.\n\nIn this campaign, MuddyWater employs updated TTPs. These include a new public hosting\nservice, employing a LNK file to initiate the infection, and utilizing intermediate malware that\nmimics the opening of a directory while executing a new remote administration tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the victim has been infected, the MuddyWater operator will connect to the infected host\nusing the legitimate remote administration tool and will start doing reconnaissance on the\ntarget.\n\nAfter the reconnaissance phase, the operator will likely execute PowerShell code which will\ncause the infected host to beacon to a custom C2 server.\n\nMuddyWater has used [PhonyC2 in the past. However, Deep Instinct recently observed](https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog/phonyc2-revealing-a-new-malicious-command-control-framework-by-muddywater)\nMuddyWater using a new C2 framework named MuddyC2Go – a detailed blog will be\npublished soon, stay tuned.\n\nIOCs:\n\nFile\n\n**MD5** **Description**\n\n37c3f5b3c814e2c014abc1210e8e69a2 Archive containing Atera Agent\n\n16923d827a440161217fb66a04e8b40a Atera Agent Installer\n\n7568062ad4b22963f3930205d1a14df7 Archive containing Atera Agent\n\n39eea24572c14910b67242a16e24b768 Archive containing Atera Agent\n\n2e09e53135376258a03b7d793706b70f Atera Agent Installer\n\n1f0b9aed4b2c8d958a9b396852a62c9d Archive containing SimpleHelp\n\n065f0871b6025b8e61f35a188bca1d5c SimpleHelp Installer\n\n146cc3a1a68be349e70b79f9115c496b defense-video.zip\n\ndd247ccd7cc3a13e1c72bb01cf3a816d Attachments.lnk\n\n8d2199fa11c6a8d95c1c2b4add70373a Diagnostic.exe\n\n04afff1465a223a806774104b652a4f0 Advanced Monitoring Agent Installer\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** **Description**\n\n6167f03c8b2734c20eb02d406d3ba651 Decoy Document (defense-video.zip)\n\ne8f3ecc0456fcbbb029b1c27dc1faad0 attachments.zip\n\n952cc4e278051e349e870aa80babc755 Decoy Document (attachments.zip)\n\nNetwork\n\n**IP or URL** **Description**\n\nws.onehub[.]com/files/7f9dxtt6 URL to Archive of Atera\nAgent\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/253959/x/b92ea48421/form.zip URL to Archive of Atera\nAgent\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/255988/x/5e0186f61d/questionnaire.zip URL to Archive of Atera\nAgent\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/259791/x/94f59e378f/questionnaire.zip URL to Archive of\nSimpleHelp\n\n146.70.149[.]61 MuddyWater’s SimpleHelp\nserver\n\n146.70.124[.]102 Suspected MuddyWater’s\nSimpleHelp server\n\n37.120.237[.]204 Suspected MuddyWater’s\nSimpleHelp server\n\n37.120.237[.]248 Suspected MuddyWater’s\nSimpleHelp server\n\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/259837/x/21e6a04837/defensevideo.zip\n\n\nURL to Archive of Advanced\nMonitoring Agent\n\n\n-----\n\n**IP or URL** **Description**\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/259791/x/91e2f5fa2f/attachments.zip URL to Archive of Advanced\nMonitoring Agent\n\nAdditional IOCs regarding MuddyWater can be found in our GitHub page:\n\n[https://github.com/deepinstinct/Israel-Cyber-Warfare-Threat-Actors](https://github.com/deepinstinct/Israel-Cyber-Warfare-Threat-Actors)\n\n\n-----",
