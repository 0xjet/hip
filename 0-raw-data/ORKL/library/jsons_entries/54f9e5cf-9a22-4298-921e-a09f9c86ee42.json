A\nfew hours ago, we lost access to the public part of our infrastructure, namely : Blog,\nPayment server, DOS servers,\" reads the forum post from UNKN.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow these servers are unavailable via SSH, the hosting panels are blocked. Hosting\nsupport, apart from information \"at the request of law enfocement agencies\", does not\nprovide any other information.\"\n\n**Forum post by UKNK about DarkSide seizure**\n\n_Source:_ _[Dmitry Smilyanet](https://twitter.com/ddd1ms)_\nThis news comes a day after President Biden said in a White House press conference that\ncountries harboring ransomware networks must take action to shut them down.\n\n\"We do not believe — I emphasize, we do not believe the Russian government was\ninvolved in this attack. But we do have strong reason to believe that criminals who did the\nattack are living in Russia. That’s where it came from — were from Russia,\" Biden said in\na [press conference about the Colonial Pipeline attack.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/05/13/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-colonial-pipeline-incident/)\n\n\"We have been in direct communication with Moscow about the imperative for responsible\ncountries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks.\"\nStarting yesterday, security researchers and journalists noted that the DarkSide data leak\nsite [was no longer accessible, and it was speculated that law enforcement had seized the](https://twitter.com/MikaelThalen/status/1392892160106659848)\nserver.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Offline DarkSide data leak site**\nHowever, BleepingComputer has confirmed that the DarkSide Tor payment server is still\noperational at the time of this writing. If law enforcement seized the server, they might have\nkept it running to allow victims to access their decryptors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DarkSide Tor payment live at the time of writing**\nFeeling the heat from law enforcement, it has also been speculated that the DarkSide\nransomware gang may be pulling an exit scam.\n\n[After pulling in $9.4 million in ransom payments this week between Brenntag and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chemical-distributor-pays-44-million-to-darkside-ransomware/) Colonial\nPipeline, they may be stealing the money, so they do not have to pay affiliates and to blame\nit on a law enforcement operation.\n\n## DarkSide shuts down affiliate program\n\nAfter we published our story, [Intel471 gained access to the full message sent to affiliates of](https://www.intel471.com/blog/darkside-ransomware-shut-down-revil-avaddon-cybercrime)\nthe DarkSide ransomware-as-a-service operation.\n\nAccording to this message, DarkSide decided to close their operation \"due to the pressure\nfrom the US\" and after losing access to their public-facing servers.\n\nThe full translated message acquired by Intel471 is below:\n\n\n-----\n\nStarting from version one, we promised to speak about problems honestly and openly.\nA couple of hours ago, we lost access to the public part of our infrastructure, in\nparticular to the\n\nblog\n\npayment server\n\nCDN servers\n\nAt the moment, these servers cannot be accessed via SSH, and the hosting panels\nhave been blocked.\n\nThe hosting support service doesn't provide any information except \"at the request of\nlaw enforcement authorities.\" In addition, a couple of hours after the seizure, funds\nfrom the payment server (belonging to us and our clients) were withdrawn to an\nunknown account.\n\nThe following actions will be taken to solve the current issue: You will be given\ndecryption tools for all the companies that haven't paid yet.\n\nAfter that, you will be free to communicate with them wherever you want in any way\nyou want. Contact the support service. We will withdraw the deposit to resolve the\nissues with all the affected users.\n\nThe approximate date of compensation is May 23 (due to the fact that the deposit is\nto be put on hold for 10 days on XSS).\n\nIn view of the above and due to the pressure from the US, the affiliate program is\nclosed. Stay safe and good luck.\n\nThe landing page, servers, and other resources will be taken down within 48 hours.\n\nAn interesting point in this message is that the affiliates will be provided decryptors for their\nvictims. These decryptors will allow the affiliates to extort those victims on their own without\nany affiliation with DarkSide.\n\n## REvil ransomware adds new restrictions\n\nHistorically, the REvil ransomware gang has shown no scruples regarding who they attack.\n\nHowever, after the DarkSide's reported takedown, REvil has now begun to impose new\nrestrictions on who can be encrypted.\n\nREvil's representative, UNKN, states that affiliates are now required first to gain permission\nto target an organization and that they can no longer target the following entities:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Work in the social sector (health care, educational institutions) is prohibited;\n2. It is forbidden to work on the gov-sector (state) of any country;\n\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operations have historically run as a free-for-all, where\naffiliates encrypt any victim they want without gaining prior approval.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if these new rules will lead affiliates to move to other RaaS\noperations with fewer restrictions.\n\n_Update 5/14/21: Added full message sent to affiliates about DarkSide closing down._\n_Changed DoS to CDN (thx Evgueni)._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[REvil's TOR sites come alive to redirect to new ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revils-tor-sites-come-alive-to-redirect-to-new-ransomware-operation/)\n\n[CryptoCurrency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cryptocurrency/)\n[DarkSide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/darkside/)\n[Law Enforcement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/law-enforcement/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
