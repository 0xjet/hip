Activist.\n\nFeb 14 · 13 min read\n\n# Operation Kingphish: Uncovering a Campaign of Cyber Attacks against Civil Society in Qatar and Nepal\n\nOver the course of 2016 — and particularly intensifying towards the\n\nend of the year — several individuals known to Amnesty International\n\nwere approached via email and through social media by “Safeena\n\nMalik”, seemingly an enthusiastic activist with a strong interest in\n\nhuman rights. What lied beneath this facade was a well-engineered\n\ncampaign of phishing attacks designed to steal credentials and spy on\n\nthe activity of dozens of journalists, human rights defenders, trade\n\nunions and labour rights activists, many of whom are seemingly\n\ninvolved in the issue of migrants’ rights in Qatar and Nepal.\n\nOur investigation of the attacks didn’t yield any evidence that would\n\nindicate the conclusive responsibility of a particular government,\n\nalthough we suspect these attacks might have been orchestrated by a\n\nstate-affiliated actor. We refer to this campaign and the associated\n\nactor as Operation Kingphish (“Malik”, in one of its written forms in\n\nArabic, translates to “King”).\n\nIt is worth noting that in December 2016, Amnesty International\n\npublished an investigation into another social engineering campaign\n\nperpetrated by a seemingly fake human rights organization known as\n\n[Voiceless Victims, which targeted international human rights and](https://medium.com/amnesty-insights/beyond-fake-news-an-investigation-into-the-murky-world-of-fake-campaigns-f4af8118844b)\n\nlabour rights organizations campaigning on migrant workers’ rights in\n\nQatar. While there is a clear alignment of interests, we have found no\n\nevidence to suggest these two campaigns are directly connected.\n\n## . . .\n\n# Migrants’ rights in Qatar\n\nMigrant workers, mainly from South Asia, comprise more than 90% of\n\nQatar’s workforce, with Nepalis being one of the largest nationalities.\n\nThe exploitation of migrant workers in Qatar, particularly in the\n\nconstruction sector, has been widely reported on since Qatar won the\n\nright to host the 2022 World Cup. The sponsorship system, which ties\n\n\n-----\n\nmigrant workers to their employers has been widely criticized as\n\nbeing a major driver of exploitation.\n\n### Qatar: World Cup 2022 forced labour\n\nYouTube\n\n[As Amnesty International reported, recent changes to laws governing](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/12/qatar-migrant-workers-still-at-risk-of-abuse-despite-reforms/)\n\nthe migrant labour system in Qatar barely scratch the surface of the\n\nproblem and continue to leave migrant workers, including those\n\nbuilding stadiums and infrastructure for the World Cup, at the mercy\n\nof exploitative bosses and at risk of serious human rights abuses\n\nincluding forced labour. Workers still require exit permits to leave the\n\ncountry, which can still be blocked by their employer, and employers\n\ncan now legally keep hold of their workers’ passports under a new\n\nloophole which can be easily exploited.\n\n## . . .\n\n# “Safeena Malik” phishing expedition\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: throughout the report we have redacted, where necessary, names\n\nand email addresses of individuals and organizations targeted in order to\n\nprotect their identity and safety. We have also obscured wherever possible\n\nthe pictures utilized by the attackers on the fake social media profiles, as\n\nthey have been likely stolen from people with no involvement in these\n\nattacks.\n\nOur investigation revealed that unidentified attackers have\n\npurposefully created and maintained what appears to be a fake online\n\npersona, named “Safeena Malik”, in order to regularly engage in\n\nconversations with the selected targets, and at different times and\n\nwith different pretenses try to lure them into giving away their\n\ncredentials to their Gmail account through the use of phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing is a hacking technique that often consists of mimicking\n\npopular online services (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and\n\nLinkedin) and credibly replicating their login pages, with the goal of\n\nstealing usernames and passwords from the designated victims by\n\nluring them into mistakenly authenticating through such pages.\n\nThis type of attack is extremely popular, and often used against\n\nmembers of civil society. It is relatively easy and cheap to orchestrate,\n\nand if successful it grants the attackers access to victims’ personal and\n\nprofessional email accounts, which can obviously reveal very sensitive\n\ninformation. For example, having an activist’s email account phished\n\nmight lead to the reconstruction of their network, exposure of sources’\n\nidentities, as well as abuse of their accounts for impersonation. By\n\ncomparison, phishing attacks are likely significantly more common\n\nthan malware attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are normally delivered through emails soliciting the\n\ntarget to open a link and login to, for example, a Google-like page.\n\nThe strategies used to make this solicitation credible can vary. Often,\n\nfor example, the email would falsely inform the victim that their\n\naccount has been hacked, urgently requiring a password reset.\n\n\n-----\n\n“Safeena Malik” has a full presence on social media but her twitter\n\naccount, created in December 2014 has only one visible tweet, dating\n\nfrom 23 December 2014, a simple “hi”. We believe it is possible that\n\nthe operators of Operation Kingphish might have acquired a set of\n\npre-registered (or stolen) social media profiles online. The accounts\n\n“Safeena Malik” follows show a clear pattern: a large number of\n\nMiddle East-based journalists for international publications, staff of\n\ninternational human rights organizations and trade unions, and\n\nvarious campaigns for migrants’ rights in Qatar.\n\nTheir Facebook account appears to be more active, and their LinkedIn\n\nprofile, has 500+ connections.\n\nThe various social media accounts communicated regularly with\n\nseveral of the victims we identified, often for many months. It appears\n\nthat the attackers may have impersonated the identity of a real young\n\nwoman and stole her pictures to construct the fake profile, along with\n\na professional biography also stolen from yet another person. The\n\nemails and messages sent by the fake “Safeena Malik” would normally\n\nbe timed around — before, and following — the delivery of yet another\n\nattempt at phishing the credentials of the designated victims.\n\n## Case 1: Fake Google, real Google\n\nFor example, in the exchange below, “Safeena” tried to lure the target\n\nby purporting to be seeking help on some important research on\n\nhuman trafficking.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the course of this email correspondence, the attacker — “Safeena”\n\n— then sent what appeared to be invitations to access several\n\ndocuments on Google Drive.\n\nThe links and buttons contained in the emails would direct the victim\n\nto a webpage that looked something like this:\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: the pro�le picture has been manipulated to protect the identity of the target.\n\nThe page is designed to mimic a standard Google login page, with a\n\nhigh degree of accuracy. While most common phishing pages would\n\nonly provide an empty form to enter an email address and password,\n\nthis one instead is configured to display the profile picture, the\n\naccount name, and the email address of the victim. This is obscured in\n\nthe above screenshot to protect the privacy of the victim.\n\nThis design effectively replicates a real Google login page, which\n\nwould similarly display the same information if you had previously\n\nlogged into your account from a computer. The attackers were\n\nmeticulous in making their phishing page as credible as possible.\n\nInterestingly, after the victims would have entered their Google\n\naccount credentials, they would be redirected to an actual document\n\nhosted on Google Drive, effectively recreating a normal browsing\n\nexperience in order to avoid suspicion. In the example below, the\n\ntarget would have been redirected to a PowerPoint presentation on\n\nhuman trafficking. Amnesty has identified that this presentation had\n\n[also been stolen from another source.](http://slideplayer.com/slide/4051538)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Case 2: Making friends and connections\n\nAmong the targets of this campaign is the International Trade Union\n\nConfederation (ITUC). ITUC is a trade union federation based in\n\nBrussels and among the largest in the world, counting over 170\n\nmillion members. ITUC has been very outspoken in recent years about\n\n[migrant labour rights in Qatar, and is behind the “Re-Run the Vote!”](http://www.rerunthevote.org/)\n\ncampaign against the award of the organization of the 2022 FIFA\n\nWorld Cup to Qatar.\n\nBoth in the attacks against ITUC and in other occasions, the attackers\n\napproached selected targets over social media, prominently Facebook,\n\nand engaged in chat conversations with them on and off, sometimes\n\nover a period of several months. At times the attackers behind the\n\nprofile would just have a short casual conversation, while at others\n\nthey attempted an attack. Possibly in order to identify further targets,\n\n“Safeena Malik” found her way into several Facebook groups dealing\n\nwith migrant workers and forced labour.\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarly to attempts described previously, in this case the attackers\n\nalso invited the targets to open a document seemingly shared on\n\nGoogle Drive. This time the document purported to be about the\n\ninvolvement of the Emir of Qatar in funding ISIS, which was\n\nseemingly copied from a website critical of Qatar.\n\nOnce the target would provide their credentials through the fake\n\nGoogle login page, they would also be automatically redirected to an\n\nexisting document hosted on the legitimate Google Drive.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile it might not appear significant, this attention to detail is what,\n\nin our experience, sets apart these phishing attempts from more\n\ncommon ones, as they demonstrate a level of experience and care that\n\nis both unusual and remarkable.\n\n## Case 3: Hanging out\n\nSimilar tactics are exemplified by yet another case we’ve become\n\naware of and portrayed in the picture below, where the fake “Safeena\n\nMalik” profile is conversing with a prominent activist from Nepal\n\nworking on migrant workers issues, soliciting them to give away their\n\nGmail address.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the attackers tried to leverage common Facebook friends\n\nin an attempt to convince the target of their legitimacy. This is a tactic\n\nwe’ve observed the attackers utilize on numerous occasions across\n\ntheir conversations with some of the targets we know of, which\n\nexplains the time and effort spent in building a large social graph.\n\nIn this case, the attackers very credibly pretended to have been\n\ninviting the targets to participate in a Google Hangout (a\n\nvideoconferencing service operated by Google).\n\n\n-----\n\nAgain, when clicking on the button the target would be presented\n\nwith a Google-like login page.\n\n\n-----\n\nNote: the pro�le picture has been manipulated to protect the identity of the target.\n\n## . . .\n\n# Identifying the Victims\n\nWhile we first learned of these attacks through a journalist who was\n\ntargeted, we soon learned of many others.\n\nWhat we discovered, is that the phishing pages are in fact\n\n“configurable”. The links sent via email to the targets contains all the\n\nrequired information for the phishing page to load the appropriate\n\nprofile picture and names.\n\nFor example, a link would look like this (please note that the links have\n\nbeen edited to disable any accidental clicks and redacted to protect the\n\nvictim’s privacy):\n\n\nhxxp://rqeuset.hanguot.g-puls.viwe.accnnoutloookout.auditi.devisionial-checlkout.inistructiionmutuael.halftoine.appliacctiorn-gurad-way.leigacy-fs.termpforn.provider-saefe.alvie-valuse.tokencenteir.recollect.label.ping2port[.]info/?ml=\n\n[REDACTED]=&n@e=[REDACTED]&P4t=\n\n\n-----\n\n[REDACTED]&Re3d=aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tL2g5d3h3cDg=&pa=2&gp\n=1\n\n\nIn the URL there are some encoded values passed to the webpage,\n\nwhich decode to the following:\n\n\nhxxp://rqeuset.hanguot.g-puls.viwe.accnnoutloookout.auditi.devisionial-checlkout.inistructiionmutuael.halftoine.appliacctiorn-gurad-way.leigacy-fs.termpforn.provider-saefe.alvie-valuse.tokencenteir.recollect.label.ping2port[.]info/?ml=[REDACTED]&n@e=\n\n[REDACTED]&P4t=//ping2port.info/[REDACTED]/[REDACTED].jpg&Re\n3d=http://tinyurl.com/h9wxwp8&pa=2&gp=1\n\n\nThe first value is the email address of the target, the second is the\n\naccount name (most often the full real name of the intended target),\n\nthe third value is an address pointing to a copy of the target’s profile\n\npicture pulled from their Google+ or YouTube profile, and the last is a\n\nlink to which the victim will be redirected after their credentials have\n\nbeen successfully stolen.\n\nThe stolen profile pictures would be stored on the server owned by\n\nthe attackers. Interestingly, their filename and location were\n\npredictable as they would be normally saved in a particular folder\n\nwith a filename that would be a combination of two lower-case letters.\n\nFor example:\n\nhxxp://ping2port[.]info/[REDACTED]/xx.jpg (this particular\n\nfilename is fictional, and the URL has been disabled to prevent misclicks).\n\nAs we noticed that this pattern was repeated across a couple of\n\nattacks that came to our attention, we realized we might be able to\n\nidentify additional victims by regularly attempting to download all the\n\navailable profile pictures stored with all the 676 possible combinations\n\nof two-letter filenames. Once we obtained new profile pictures, a\n\nsimple image search online could reveal the identity behind these\n\nvictims.\n\nSurely enough, it allowed us to identify nearly 30 distinct targets.\n\nMost identified targets were activists, journalists, and labour union\n\nmembers. While some of targets had published critical opinions about\n\nQatar’s international affairs, the majority of identified targets were\n\n\n-----\n\naffiliated with organisations supporting migrant workers in Qatar.\n\nInterestingly, a significant number of them are from Nepal, which is\n\none of the largest nationalities amongst migrant workers in Qatar, and\n\na country that has featured prominently in the migrant worker\n\nnarrative on Qatar.\n\nWe learned however of several more targets who appeared to not\n\nhave been configured with a stored profile picture, so it is possible\n\nthat the number of actual targets was far larger. Through our\n\nconversations with identified targets it became clear that “Safeena\n\nMalik” often approached members of thematic Facebook groups and\n\nasked for information and contact details about further targets we\n\nwere not originally aware of.\n\n## . . .\n\n# Who is behind the attacks?\n\nWe don’t have conclusive evidence that could implicate any particular\n\ngovernment or individual as being responsible for these attacks, but\n\nthe fact that the campaign specifically targets individuals active on\n\nhuman rights issues in Qatar, makes us believe that it might be a\n\nstate-sponsored or affiliated actor. We believe it is also possible that\n\nthese attacks have been orchestrated by contractors. In fact, similar\n\nintelligence gathering operations uncovered in other GCC countries,\n\nhave shown a reliance on outsourcing this work to private firms.\n\nInterestingly, the attackers logged into some of the harvested email\n\naccounts from the IP address 178.152.139.XXX [last octet redacted] as\n\nthese Gmail recent activity records display:\n\nThis IP address appears to be an Internet connection provided by\n\nOoredoo, an Internet Service Provider with headquarters in Doha,\n\n\n-----\n\nQatar.\n\nNote: the geographical mapping of an IP address is often very approximate, and while it indicates that the\nattackers used a connection in Doha, the coordinates, which were provided by the free MaxMind service should\n\nnot to be considered to be a precise location.\n\nWe wrote to the Government of Qatar with information about this\n\nphishing campaign and asking about their possible involvement. They\n\nresponded, vigorously denying any link to the attacks. (We should\n\nnote that Amnesty International was not one of the targets of this\n\ncampaign.)\n\nThe Government of Qatar also expressed their interest in stopping the\n\nphishing attacks.\n\nWe also wrote to “Safeena Malik” on the Gmail address used to\n\ncontact targets. We summarized our findings and asked for a\n\nresponse. We similarly contacted the Facebook account used in the\n\nattacks. As of publication, we have not received any reply.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile there is a clear underlying Qatar migrant workers theme in this\n\ncampaign, it is also hypothetically possible that these attacks could\n\nhave been perpetrated by a malicious actor affiliated to a different\n\ngovernment with an interest in damaging the reputation of the State\n\nof Qatar.\n\nHowever, in the absence of clear evidence, trying to identify the entity\n\nbehind this attack can only be speculative. As such, we cannot make\n\nany conclusive attribution.\n\n## . . .\n\n# Have I been targeted too?\n\nFollowing is a Gmail query to search for specific keywords that we\n\nbelieve are unique to the malicious emails sent by the “Safeena Malik”\n\nprofile.\n\nfrom:safeenamalik6 OR \"ropelastic.com\" OR \"ping2port.info\"\n\nYou can copy and paste it in the search bar at the top of your Gmail\n\nwindow like so:\n\nIf you have received any emails related to this campaign, Gmail\n\nshould filter them from your inbox and highlight them to you.\n\nIf you have further information about this campaign or have been\n\ntargeted, and would like to share information with us, you can write\n\n[us at tech.reports@amnesty.org or use Amnesty’s secure dropbox](mailto:tech.reports@amnesty.org)\n\n[https://amlea.org/en/.](https://amlea.org/en/)\n\n# Some tips to protect yourself against phishing\n\nBe careful with links: before clicking a link or button on an email\n\ncheck where it is redirecting you to. You can usually do this by\n\n\n-----\n\nhovering your mouse pointer over the link or button; you can also find\n\nout by right-clicking and copying the link. If an email tells you it’s\n\ntaking you to Facebook or Gmail but the link doesn’t look like like a\n\nFacebook or Google address, then there might be something wrong. If\n\nyou’re not sure, type the address yourself and log in.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication: two-factor authentication is an\n\nextra step you need to log-in to your account. In most cases, it’s very\n\nsimple and you only need to do it when you use a new device or once\n\nevery few weeks. Most commonly you will be required to provide a\n\nsix-digit code delivered through your phone either through an SMS\n\nmessage, or preferably through a mobile app, like Google\n\nAuthenticator, Authy or Duo Mobile. While it might appear tedious at\n\nfirst, this process makes it a lot harder to hack your online accounts,\n\nas your passwords alone wouldn’t be sufficient to access them.\n\n[Many popular services have two-factor authentication, including](https://twofactorauth.org/)\n\nGmail, Outlook, Facebook and Twitter. You can read more details on\n\n[two-factor authentication here.](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication)\n\nBe wary of strangers: if someone you don’t know contacts you and\n\nstarts asking you for personal details, contact details and names of\n\npeople you know, treat it with suspicion. A simple rule is: if you\n\nwouldn’t share it on twitter, don’t share information with someone\n\nyou don’t know, even if it is someone who appears to have friends on\n\nsocial media in common with you. As we learned from this campaign,\n\nattackers do commonly befriend many people to leverage common\n\nsocial connections as a way to appear more credible and legitimate.\n\n## . . .\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n[This report is the product of investigations by Claudio Guarnieri,](https://twitter.com/botherder)\n\n[Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Ashmita Sapkota and others at Amnesty](https://twitter.com/sherifea)\n\nInternational, and with the help Collin Anderson.
