The emails were made to look like they](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=38d9a6b0-433c-4ab6-8a37-4413343e3c0c&CommunityKey=f5d62f53-a337-4805-842f-e5bc06329b21&tab=librarydocuments)\nwere from the Central Bank of Russia and offered employment to their recipients. Instead of\n[being an actual employment offer, the emails were an attempt to deliver Trojan.Ratopak](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-120705-5313-99)\nonto the target’s computer.\n\nTrojan.Ratopak was likely used because it can allow the attacker to gain control of the\ncompromised computer and steal information. The threat can open a back door on the\ncomputer and allow the attacker to perform a variety of actions, including logging\nkeystrokes, retrieving clipboard data, and viewing and controlling the screen. It can also be\nused to download other malicious files and tools. The narrow focus of the attacks and the\nuse of Ratopak could be a hint to what the attackers were after.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Legitimate-looking emails**\nThe attackers went to some effort to make the emails appear legitimate, even going as far\nas to register a domain very similar to the genuine Central Bank of Russia website. The\nURL for the Central Bank of Russia website is “cbr.ru”, while the URL for the attackercontrolled website is “cbr.com.ru”. The link to the attacker’s site was included in the email\nsent to their victims and pointed to an archive file. Once extracted, the archive file opened a\nfake document and downloaded Trojan.Ratopak. We have seen Ratopak signed with stolen\ncertificates, which can be used to avoid detection because it makes the malware appear to\ncome from a legitimate source. We’ve previously seen stolen certificates used by attack\n[groups including Black Vine and](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-black-vine-cyberespionage-group.pdf) [Hidden Lynx.](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/hidden_lynx.pdf)\n\nThe emails sent out for this campaign appear to have been written by a native Russian\nspeaker, using clean and simple language. This is also backed up by the fact that the\nattackers would need to speak Russian to make use of the information stolen through\nRatopak. There are no obvious errors, except for one. The name in the “From:” line of the\nemail header differs from the signature at the end of the email. This and the “.com” in the\nURL are the clearest indicators that this is a fake email.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure. Spoofed employment offer email (in Russian) with a link to Trojan.Ratopak and_\n_translation_\n\nA similar email attack that also utilized Trojan.Ratopak occurred in October. We discovered\nthat the attackers used another domain similar to a legitimate one to host the threat, but\nwere not able to obtain a copy of the email. The attackers used the name of a private bank\nand the URL again included “.com.ru” instead of “.ru”. Given the attack in December, it is\nvery likely that the attackers spoofed their email so it appeared to come from the private\nbank, and then used a link or attachment from the fake banking website to download the\nthreat onto the victim’s computer.\n\n**Narrow, targeted attacks**\n\nSymantec has identified six Russian banks that were targeted in these attacks. All of the\naffected computers are located in Russia. Of those computers, a substantial number used\naccounting and document management software that allowed secure documents to be\nexchanged with the government for tax purposes. A common link between several of the\nvictims was a piece of software created by SBIS, a Russian company that develops, among\nother things, accounting and payroll applications. In URLs used by SBIS, their accounting\nsoftware is referred to as “buh” (buh.sbis.ru/buh/ for example. “Buh” is the Russian term for\n\n\n-----\n\naccountant).The attackers behind these attacks used buh in their URLs, knowing their\nvictims would be running SBIS accounting software. By using this string in their URLs, the\nattackers can disguise their attack by making their activities look like normal traffic. This\n[approach has led other researchers to label Trojan.Ratopak as “Buhtrap”](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/04/09/operation-buhtrap/)\n\nCompromised computers may connect to the following domains; note the use of “buh” in\nseveral of them:\n\ngoogle997.com\nmicrosoft775.com\nnewsbuh1c.net\nbuh.klerk.us\nbuhnews.com\nfootball.championat.biz\nforum.ru-tracker.net\nicq.chatovod.info\nrss.sport-express.biz\n\nThe threat also checks the language of the compromised computer. If it isn’t Russian or\nUkrainian, then the malware stops its attack. Ratopak may also terminate and delete itself if\nit recognizes that it is being run on a virtual machine or a researcher’s computer.\n\n**The attackers’ goal**\nWhile there is no conclusive evidence of the attacker’s goal, the attacks appear to be\nfinancially motivated. The specificity of the targets−employees at certain banks using\naccounting software to send the government tax information−certainly points towards this\ngoal. By using Ratopak, which can open a backdoor and log keystrokes, the attackers could\nposition themselves to steal money, either by controlling the compromised computer or\nusing the employees’ stolen login credentials. Any goal beyond that, including what the\nattackers may have wanted with government tax information, is currently unknown.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTargeted emails using finely crafted social-engineering tricks have become commonplace,\n[with an increasing number targeted at employees of financial institutions. While these](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=cb348610-d171-4302-a5f4-349ab4596500&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nemails sent to Russian bank employees appear to contain job offers, they only help give\nattackers access to the targeted computers. Users can avoid these attacks and others like\nthem by being aware and taking the appropriate action if offered a job or service that they\ndidn’t apply for.\n\n**Mitigation**\nSymantec advises caution when receiving unsolicited emails extending job offers or\nreferencing non-existent job applications. Even if an email seems legitimate, the attackers\nmay have gone to serious effort to disguise the fact that it is actually fake. We also advise\nfollowing these best practices:\n\n\n-----\n\nDo not open attachments or click on links in unsolicited email messages\nEnsure that your computer is fully patched and up to date\nKeep security software up to date with the latest definitions\n\n**Protection**\n[Symantec's Email Security products can be used to defend against email-based attacks.](http://www.symantec.com/email/)\n\n[Norton Security,](https://us.norton.com/) [Symantec Endpoint Protection, and other](https://www.symantec.com/endpoint-protection/) [Symantec security products](http://www.symantec.com/products-solutions/)\nprotect users against these attacks with the following detections:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n[Trojan.Ratopak](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-120705-5313-99)\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\n[System Infected: Trojan.Ratopak Activity](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=23644)\n\n## Technical details\n\nTrojan.Ratopak is delivered in a convoluted way and is a collection of several components\ninstalled in three stages.\n\n**Stage 1: Email**\n\nThe path to Trojan.Ratopak begins with an email (Figure 1) that is sent to the victims. This\nemail contains a link to a file on the cbr.com.ru website. If the victim clicks on the link, a\nmalicious file with downloader capabilities is downloaded. This file has the following hash:\n\nbbac2e213bb8bafae6c6587a5bf477d3\n\n**Stage 2: Downloader**\n\nThe downloaded file from stage 1 is a Nullsoft installer that contains obfuscated Nullsoft\nscript.\n\nThe following decoy file is extracted from the Nullsoft installer and then opened with\nshellexecute:\n\n%Temp%\\vacanciya.doc\n\nThe malware then checks the default language ID using the following API:\n\nGetSystemDefaultLangID\n\nIf the language is not Russian or Ukrainian, the malware will exit and delete itself.\n\nIt checks for the following processes to determine if it is running on a virtual machine or a\nresearcher's computer:\n\n\n-----\n\nwireshark.exe\nregmon.exe\nfilemon.exe\nprocmon.exe\nvboxservice.exe\nvmtoolsd.exe\nollydbg.exe\nwindbg.exe\nsyserapp.exe\nx96_dbg.exe\nx32_dbg.exe\nx64_dbg.exe\n\nIf it finds any of these processes, the threat will exit and delete itself.\n\nIt checks for the following .dll files to determine if it is running on a sandbox:\n\ndbghelp.dll\npstorec.dll\nvmcheck.dll\n\nIf it finds any of these .dll files, the threat will exit and delete itself.\n\nAfter the threat passes these checks, it downloads a file from the following HTTP URL:\n\n[REDACTED]7.com/kliko/res1.cab\n\n**Stage 3: Trojan.Ratopak**\nThis downloaded file from stage 2 has the following hash and is Trojan.Ratopak:\n\nf4ae5579930f20ccc41d1f8b1e417e87\n\nRatopak arrives as a Nullsoft installer containing both clean files and malicious\ncomponents. Ratopak uses clean applications to launch itself. This technique is referred to\n[as side-loading and has also been seen with Backdoor.Korplug.](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=92ba6c16-9661-478c-bda5-6427f3061ab6&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n\nThe threat checks for the language ID with the following API:\n\nGetSystemDefaultLangID\n\nIf the language is not Russian, it will exit and delete itself.\n\nThe Trojan drops the following file, which is a .7z password-protected archive:\n\n%Temp%\\install.dat\n\n\n-----\n\nThe password for install.dat is 9041bU7n4R and it contains clean and malicious files. The\nclean files (Guide.exe and Videoconverter.exe) are executed first and then the malicious\nfiles are loaded through the side-loading technique.\n\nThe Trojan may then try to connect to one of the following domains to receive instructions:\n\ngoogle997.com\nmicrosoft775.com\nnewsbuh1c.net\n\nSymantec has also detected the threat connecting to the following locations:\n\nbuh.klerk.us\nbuhnews.com\nfootball.championat.biz\nforum.ru-tracker.net\nicq.chatovod.info\nrss.sport-express.biz\n\n\n-----",
