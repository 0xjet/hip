    "plain_text": "# Conti puts the ‘organized’ in organized crime\n\n**intel471.com/blog/conti-leaks-cybercrime-fire-team**\n\nCombing through business intelligence platforms to find new prospects. Deciding whether to\nfocus on huge multinational companies or small- and medium-sized businesses. Finding the\nright person to contact in the organization. Developing a script that will land information\nthat’s critically needed for success.\n\nThe above scenario is one that may seem familiar to anyone that works in sales. However,\nthis set of actions has also been adopted by organizations which make money by less\n[conventional means, particularly criminals who are responsible for ransomware attacks.](https://intel471.com/glossary/ransomware)\n\nDue in part to the leak of information tied to the Conti ransomware group, Intel 471 was able\nto piece together the inner workings of the notorious criminal syndicate. With this\ninformation, researchers were able to understand how Conti conducted its actions, which\noften mirrored processes used by countless legitimate businesses.\n\nIntel 471 discovered communications tied to one division of Conti which had its own\ndedicated mission. This team was responsible for collecting information on targets for\n[ongoing and future attacks, drafting phishing scripts that were used over the phone and sent](https://intel471.com/glossary/phishing)\nvia email, and applying multiple forms of pressure in the course of ransomware negotiations.\nThe team had access to several open-source intelligence (OSINT) and business intelligence\ntools, as well as a legal “expert” who provided advice on how to threaten victims with\nlitigation or official complaints that would be sent to government authorities. In chats found\nby Intel 471 researchers, some team members were unaware they were working for criminals,\ninstead believing they worked for a company providing competitive intelligence to their\ncustomer base.\n\n**Team Building!**\n\nThe division, known inside Conti as the “Fire Team,” started in July 2021 as a way for the\ngang to invent cover stories for phishing phone calls to targeted personnel, as well as\nrandomize spam letters to potential victims. By November 2021, the team consisted of 10\npeople, which prepared operational and revenue reports on potential targets. The team\nleader allegedly made US $3,000 per month while members were paid US $2,000 per\nmonth. In addition to their salary, team members also received a one percent cut of any\nransom they helped negotiate. While ransom cuts were dispersed via cryptocurrency, some\nsalaries were paid via prepaid bank cards.\n\n[Despite initially being stood up to do reconnaissance on future targets, the team started](https://intel471.com/glossary/reconnaissance)\nransomware negotiations as more members were brought on board.\n\n**I'm going to need those TPS reports... ASAP**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe reports put together by the team contained general information on targeted companies\nthat included operations and revenue. However, the team focused heavily on the target’s\npersonnel. The reports were required to include phone numbers, email addresses and social\nmedia accounts of the company’s leadership, mid-level employees, and some information\ntechnology personnel. Leaders requested contact information of at least 20 personnel per\nreport, with encouragement to focus on female employees.\n\nSome people were also tasked to collect open source information on a target’s network\ninfrastructure following directions that included:\n\nInternet domains\n\n[WHOIS data like IP notations, domain registrar, age, and who purchased the domain.](https://intel471.com/glossary/ip)\n\nSubdomains, with IP addresses if possible\n\nSSL certificates in raw format, open TCP ports, and vulnerabilities found using OSINT\ntools\n\n“Remember, any information about the company may be useful for its competitor (our\nclient), therefore, do not disregard any nuances that may seem insignificant at first glance.\nWe need EVERYTHING!,” a team leader posted in a Russian-language chat discovered by\nIntel 471 researchers.\n\nThe team apparently utilized several tools and subscription-based services to gather the\ninformation required. Those most frequently mentioned included the SignalHire contact\ninformation platform, the SpiderFoot OSINT tool and the Shodan search engine. Another\nteam member brought on in November 2021 apparently also had access to a paid version of\nthe ZoomInfo business intelligence platform.\n\n**Companies that made the cut**\n\nIn the early stages of standing up the division, the higher-level leaders of Conti asked for\ndraft reports on a variety of high-profile technology, pharmaceutical and finance industry\ncompanies. However, a month later, the team changed direction, focusing on organizations\nin the aerospace, chemical, defense, energy, hospitality and medical equipment industries,\nparticularly those with an annual revenue from US $500 million to US $5 billion.\n\nAs affiliates launched attacks, reconnaissance assignments changed. Actors from other parts\nof the group told the team to find information on dental clinics and online stories, as they\nwere considered to be the “best” targets. Preference also was given to insurance, law and\nlogistics companies.\n\n**Circling back on deliverables**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Fire Team s leader took the information gathered in the reports and used it for various\nransomware negotiations, often collaborating with other people working within the\nsyndicate. Some of these actors managed calls to Conti victims and potential targets, while\nothers would jump into ongoing conversations and leave messages for victims, even if they\ndid not start the negotiation process. Additionally, an alleged “lawyer” familiar with U.S. and\nEuropean legislation sought additional ways to pressure hacked companies with threats of\nlitigation from customers or employees, or official complaints that would be sent to\ngovernment authorities. This set of actors would also have side conversations about\nransomware victims, primarily focused on data that would be posted on the Conti name-andshame blog from time to time.\n\nOver the course of the conversations Intel 471 researchers observed, other actors gave the\nFire Team feedback on what types of companies it should reconnaissance on in the future.\nOne actor specifically mentioned that they were having trouble convincing JP MorganChase\nemployees over the phone to install malware. In turn the actor suggested targeting smaller\ncompanies with less strict security policies.\n\n**No job is perfect**\n\nEven criminal syndicates can’t avoid office politics. Despite the structure set up by Conti,\nteam members still complained to their bosses and one another about time spent working\nand the amount of money each member made. One team member who received 0.5% of\nransom payouts often claimed to have a much higher workload compared to the team leader\nand complained about being exploited. The team leader often called this actor “greedy” and\nactively sought to give this person more work and pay the actor less.\n\n**Ransomware, Inc.**\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries for years when discussing ransomware was wondering how\nthese criminal groups conducted operations. With the Conti leaks, the information security\ncommunity now has the best look it's ever gotten at what makes these criminal groups tick.\nAs Intel 471’s analysis shows, these groups are set up to conduct crimes as if they were a\nlegitimate business. There are divisions dedicated to examining every facet of a potential\ntarget — no matter the size — in the hopes that the information can help them extract more\nmoney post-attack. The stereotype of young men in a basement coding their way into\ninternational crime sprees is woefully inaccurate. Ransomware-as-a-service groups operate\nlike corporate entities, with payroll, revenue goals and salary bonuses worked into their\noperations. By understanding their inner workings, security teams can better adjust their\nthreat models and take the necessary steps to make sure that security measures make similar\nreconnaissance efforts worthless.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
