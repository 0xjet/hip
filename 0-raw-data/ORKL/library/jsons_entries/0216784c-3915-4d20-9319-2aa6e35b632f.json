(Getty Images)\nWritten by [Tim Starks](https://www.cyberscoop.com/author/tim-starkscyberscoop-com/)\n\nMay 26, 2021 | CYBERSCOOP\nA Belgian government ministry said this week that it was the victim of a cyber-espionage\ncampaign that began two years ago, one that has apparent links to Beijing.\n\nThe Federal Public Service Interior said it began an investigation in March after Microsoft\nrevealed that Chineses state-sponsored hackers had used zero-days to attack its Exchange\nServer technology. The ministry called in the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium for aid.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe complexity of this attack indicates an actor who has cyber capacities and extensive\n[resources,” the ministry aid in a statement on it website Tuesday. “The perpetrators acted in](https://www.ibz.be/fr/presse/le-spf-interieur-a-fait-face-a-une-cyberattaque-et-modernise-son-infrastructure-informatique)\na targeted manner, which suggests espionage.”\n\nA ministry spokesperson didn’t immediately answer a message about whether the attack it\nendured dating back to 2019 were explicitly linked to the espionage Microsoft first alleged\ntwo months ago, instead of merely triggering a probe that uncovered a separate campaign.\n\nThe earliest reported attacks exploiting the Exchange Server vulnerabilities surfaced in\nJanuary of this year. But those vulnerabilities had been in its code base for more than 10\nyears. Microsoft blamed a Chineses government-connected group it calls Hafnium for\nexploiting the Exchange Server vulnerabilities.\n\nEither way, [Belgium cyber experts told local press that the campaign the FPS Interior](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/belgium-hacked-most-likely-by-china/)\ndescribed suggests Chinese involvement. Regardless of any direct links, the Microsoft\nExchange Server zero-day announcement prompted reviews that turned up attacks across\nEurope.\n\nThe FPS Interior suggested that despite the attackers spending two years in its systems, the\ndamage was both limited and now contained.\n\n“Urgent action has been taken: attacker access has been stopped, malware has been\nremoved and important information has been secured,” the website statement reads.\n\nThat said, the ministry also said its investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe announcement is the second time this month that news has broken about a cyberattack\naffecting the Belgium government. Earlier this month Belnet — which provides internet\nservices to the nation’s parliament, government agencies, universities and scientific\n[institutions — said a distributed denial of service attack disrupted internet availability.](https://www.euronews.com/2021/05/05/belgium-s-parliament-and-universities-hit-by-cyber-attack)\n\n\n-----",
