Threatens to auction Madonna's legal documents in a future auction.\n\nWritten by Catalin Cimpanu, Contributor on June 2, 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nrevil auction.png\n\n\n## See als\n\n[10 dangerous app vulnerabilities to watch out for (free PDF)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/10-dangerous-app-vulnerabilities-to-watch-out-for-free-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)\n\nThe operators of the REvil (Sodinokibi) ransomware gang have launched today an eBay-like auction site where they plan to sell data stolen\nfrom the companies they hack.\n\nThe auction portal is the latest trick in REvil's big bag of extortion tactics, and again confirms their role as trend-setter in the ransomware\ncommunity.\n\nToday, the REvil gang is known to be one of the most active and aggressive ransomware operations. They never target home consumers, but\nfocus primarily on corporate targets.\n\nThey use exploits in network appliances to breach enterprise networks, where they encrypt the victim's files and ask for astronomical extortion\nf ( ith th i d [d b i](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-average-ransom-demand-for-a-revil-ransomware-infection-is-a-whopping-260000/) $260 000 ti t d li thi )\n\n\n-----\n\ne ga g a so ope ates a ea s te o t e da eb, e e t ey pub s tease s o sto e es, a d t e t e o e sto e data, ct s\ndon't pay their desired extortion fee.\n\nHowever, in a blog post on their leak site today, the group announced the launch of a new \"auction\" feature that will allow the group to\nmonetize the stolen files instead of releasing them for free, as they did until now.\n\nThe first auction is made up of files stolen from a Canadian agricultural company, hacked and encrypted last month, but which chose not to\npay the ransom demand.\n\nThe company's files are being auctioned from a starting price of $50,000, payable in the Monero cryptocurrency, a cryptocurrency to which the\nREvil gang switched from Bitcoin in back in April, citing anonymity and privacy concerns.\n\nHowever, while the Canadian company is the first REvil victim to have its files put up for auction, the idea for the new auction feature appears\n[to have formed in the minds of the REvil gang during their ongoing extortion of a New York law firm that represents celebrities.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-asks-42m-from-ny-law-firm-threatens-to-leak-dirt-on-trump/)\n\nWhile trying to ante up the pressure on the NY law firm, in a blog post last week, the REvil gang threatened to hold an auction for Madonna's\nprivate legal documents.\n\nWhile Madonna files have not been put up for an auction just yet, the REvil gang said today that they \"remember Madonna and other people,\"\nsuggesting that her files will soon be published too, as well as other files stolen from the NYC law firm.\n\n\n-----\n\nrevil auction idea.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\n**The FBI's most wanted cybercriminals**\n\n\n-----",
