The group is using living-off-the-land tools as well as custom\nmalware in this attack campaign, including a custom malware - Backdoor.Hartip - that\nSymantec has not seen being used by the group before. Among the machines compromised\nduring this attack campaign were domain controllers and file servers, and there was\nevidence of files being exfiltrated from some of the compromised machines.\n\nThe attackers extensively use DLL side-loading in this campaign, and were also seen\nleveraging the ZeroLogon vulnerability that was patched in August 2020.\n\n## How was this campaign discovered?\n\nThis campaign was first discovered by Symantec when suspicious DLL side-loading activity\n[on one of our customer’s networks triggered an alert in our Cloud Analytics technology,](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security/endpoint/end-user/complete#related-products)\nwhich is available in Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SESC). This activity was then\nreviewed by our Threat Hunter analysts before being passed on to our investigations team\nfor further analysis.\n\nCloud Analytics leverages artificial intelligence in order to comb through Symantec’s vast\ndata and spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. It is capable of automatically\nflagging incidents that would otherwise have taken thousands of hours of analyst time to\nidentify. The initial Cloud Analytics alert allowed our threat hunting team to identify further\nvictims of this activity, build a more complete picture of this campaign, and attribute this\nactivity to Cicada. It also allowed us to update and create new protections to ensure our\ncustomers are protected from this activity.\n\n## Victims\n\nThis campaign has been ongoing since at least mid-October 2019, right up to the beginning\nof October 2020, with the attack group active on the networks of some of its victims for close\nto a year. The campaign is very wide-ranging, with victims in a large number of regions\nworldwide.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Locations of some of the companies targeted in this campaign; most of those\ntargeted have links to Japan or Japanese organizations\nThe companies hit are, in the main, large, well-known organizations, many of which have\nlinks to Japan or Japanese companies, which is one of the main factors tying the victims\ntogether. Cicada has been known to have a strong focus on Japanese organizations in\nprevious attack campaigns. As is clear from the map in Figure 1, South and East Asia are\nstrong areas of focus for the attackers in this campaign. It is unusual to see a reportedly\nChinese-government-linked group attacking companies within China’s borders but, like many\nof the companies targeted in this campaign, the target in that instance is a subsidiary of a\nJapanese organization.\n\nWe also saw similar loaders on all the victim networks. These are among the main factors\nlinking these victims together, with all of them coming from a wide variety of sectors,\nincluding:\n\nAutomotive, with some manufacturers and organizations involved in supplying parts to\nthe motor industry also targeted, indicating that this is a sector of strong interest to the\nattackers\nClothing\nConglomerates\nElectronics\nEngineering\nGeneral Trading Company\nGovernment\nIndustrial Products\nManaged Service Providers\nManufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\nPharmaceutical\nProfessional Services\n\nThe amount of time the attackers spent on the networks of victims varied, with the attackers\nspending a significant amount of time on the networks of some victims, while spending just\ndays on other victim networks. In some cases, too, the attackers spent some time on a\nnetwork but then the activity would cease, but start again some months later.\n\n## Tactics, tools, and procedures\n\nWe observed the attackers using a wide variety of living-off-the-land, dual-use, and publicly\navailable tools and techniques in these attacks, including:\n\n[Network Reconnaissance – gathering information from machines on the network.](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/)\n[Credential Theft – stealing user names and passwords, potentially to provide them with](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/)\nfurther access to the victim network.\n[RAR archiving – files are transferred to staging servers before exfiltration. They may be](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/)\nencrypted or compressed, to make them easier to extract.\n[Certutil – a command-line utility that can be exploited and used for various malicious](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil)\npurposes, such as to decode information, to download files, and to install browser root\ncertificates.\n[Adfind – a command-line tool that can be used to perform Active Directory queries.](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/7535.adfind-command-examples.aspx)\n[Csvde – can be used to extract Active Directory files and data.](https://www.computerperformance.co.uk/logon/csvde-export/)\n[Ntdsutil – can be used as a credential-dumping tool.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc753343(v=ws.11))\n[WMIExec – can be used for lateral movement and to execute commands remotely.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n[PowerShell - a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/)\nincluded in the Windows operating system. It can be used to find information and\nexecute code, and is frequently abused by malicious actors.\n\nThe threat actors also use a legitimate cloud file-hosting service for exfiltration.\n\nThe attackers also use [DLL side-loading at multiple stages during the attack, including using](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\nit to load Backdoor.Hartip. DLL side-loading occurs when attackers are able to replace a\nlegitimate library with a malicious one, allowing them to load malware into legitimate\nprocesses. Attackers use DLL side-loading to try and hide their activity by making it look\nlegitimate, and it also helps them avoid detection by security software. It is a tactic that is\ncommonly used by APT groups and has often been observed being used by nation-state\nbacked actors. Monitoring networks for unusual activity, as Symantec’s Cloud Analytics\ntechnology does, is key for detecting this kind of malicious activity.\n\nThe attackers were also seen deploying a tool capable of exploiting the ZeroLogon\n[vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472). The critical elevation-of-privilege vulnerability was first](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)\ndisclosed and patched on August 11, 2020, and can allow attackers to spoof a domain\ncontroller account and then potentially use it to steal domain credentials, take over the\n\n\n-----\n\ndomain, and completely compromise all Active Directory identity services. It has been\nexploited by multiple malicious actors since its disclosure, leading both Microsoft and the\nDepartment of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n(CISA) to issue warnings to Windows users to patch the issue as quickly as possible.\n\n## Links to Cicada\n\nThe scale and sophistication of this attack campaign indicate that it is the work of a large and\nwell-resourced group, such as a nation-state actor, with Symantec discovering enough\nevidence to attribute it with medium confidence to Cicada.\n\nSymantec analysts have linked this activity to Cicada due to the use of previously seen\nobfuscation techniques and shellcode on loader DLLs.\n\nActivity seen in one of the victim organizations has various trait similarities with previously\n[seen Cicada activity that was described in a blog by Cylance in 2019, including:](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/threat-spotlight-menupass-quasarrat-backdoor.html)\n\nThird-stage DLL has an export named \"FuckYouAnti\"\nThird-stage DLL uses CppHostCLR technique to inject and execute the .NET loader\nassembly\n.NET Loader is obfuscated with ConfuserEx v1.0.0\nFinal payload is QuasarRAT – an open-source backdoor used by Cicada in the past\n\nIn another affected organization, the loaders deploying Backdoor.Hartip overlap in the\nobfuscation and shellcode used, making us confident it is the same actor in both\norganizations.\n\n**Similarities between activity in both organizations**\n\nSide-loading DLL\nC++ usage\nAPI call sequence\nGetModuleFileName -> lstrcat -> CreateFile -> ReadFile\nLoad next-stage payload from another file\nObfuscation: lots of garbage OutputDebugString, _time64, srand, rand API calls\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Image showing links between Cicada and two victim organizations in this campaign\nThese similarities leave us confident that this is the same group carrying out this activity in\nboth organizations, and that this group is Cicada. Historically, Cicada has been seen using\ncustom DLL loaders to decrypt and execute its final payload, as is observed in these attacks.\nWe also saw similar loaders as those used in these two organizations used on other victim\nnetworks.\n\nThe scale of the operations also points to a group of Cicada’s size and capabilities. The\ntargeting of multiple large organizations in different geographies at the same time would\nrequire a lot of resources and skills that are generally only seen in nation-state backed\ngroups. The link all the victims have to Japan also points towards Cicada, which has been\nknown to target Japanese organizations in the past.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe targeting of MSPs is also a hallmark of Cicada s activity. Successfully compromising an\nMSP can give attackers high-level access to multiple companies without them having to\ncompromise the individual companies’ networks.\n\nWe have also seen Cicada utilizing some of the same publicly available tools – such as\nWMIExec – in the past. The attackers also take various steps to reduce the chances of their\nactivity being spotted – including searching for security software on victim machines using\nWMIC, and using PowerShell to clear event logs to hide their activity once they are finished\non victim machines. This kind of activity is the hallmark of sophisticated and experienced\nthreat actors.\n\nAll of these facts point to Cicada being the perpetrator of these wide-ranging and\nsophisticated attacks.\n\nIntelligence gathering and stealing information has generally been the motivation behind\nCicada’s attacks in the past, and that would appear to be the case in this attack campaign\ntoo. We observed the attackers archiving some folders of interest in these attacks, including\nin one organization folders relating to human resources (HR), audit and expense data, and\nmeeting memos.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJapan-linked organizations need to be on alert as it is clear they are a key target of this\nsophisticated and well-resourced group, with the automotive industry seemingly a key target\nin this attack campaign. However, with the wide range of industries targeted by these\nattacks, Japanese organizations in all sectors need to be aware that they are at risk of this\nkind of activity.\n\nCicada clearly still has access to a lot of resources and skills to allow it to carry out a\nsophisticated and wide-ranging campaign like this, so the group remains highly dangerous.\nIts use of a tool to exploit the recently disclosed ZeroLogon vulnerability and a custom\nbackdoor that has not been observed by Symantec before show that it continues to evolve its\ntools and tactics to actively target its victims.\n\nThe group’s use of techniques such as DLL side-loading and a wide array of living-off-theland tools underline the need for organizations to have a comprehensive security solution in\nplace to detect this kind of suspicious activity before actors like Cicada have the chance to\ndeploy malware or steal information from their networks.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\nThis activity was first discovered thanks to an alert triggered by our Cloud\nAnalytics technology, which is available in Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SESC).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n8b6ad87e408e38fc1db868da6e643f616dac59fbae08382c4a7dd4ea119ea057\nd5e38ac1187c607e701f506c4015bde94be6c485d566d004d810d7565c188743\n26460aa2df29f766cb5712ebca44cb3365ebfdb5cae0b2ec36ef1e3568911d6a\ncdec58a57381bb8c1e374efb0bf1897d89d1e096d2b704820893859d9f08d086\nea9d994de91389280b334f2af991baa49ca613a6bf898d7bb25f88cc66488f5c\n3f5b623222c755d59052fab9e096c9d2b9a47d06b3a5de62fb9a66750af4efc4\n27873e3d4ec3a0e7d66bee8bda4d65cc8fcefbdca2c8d5c049372a63ff0bc2ed\ncf3ae16b01f7eb129e0e7387ac7feb61ecfce5db0d7494b3962c02c681f504d4\n578ea26729b43fd976365a6700c80950e0b71a39e67bfff715423d60ae6bfab9\n03ab1588acaabdb509e9db7cfe1e60522bc8baa13bbd35160b4bde7d1b6402ef\n4a08eb0eb1f4ebb54bceabbebcb7da48238f0278ae5421326ee65ec7951e4239\n\n178.73.210.238\n188.119.112.225\n213.252.246.245\n45.14.224.93\n45.67.230.134\n81.7.7.159\n95.179.143.32\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n## Want to comment on this post?\n\n\n-----",
