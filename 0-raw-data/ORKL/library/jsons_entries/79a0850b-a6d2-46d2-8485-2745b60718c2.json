Detailed Analysis\n\nESRC has been investigating the cyber campaigns for several years, and found that the group has been conducting\n\nthe cyber campaigns on and off Korea since 2013. The major threat vectors exploited by the group are Watering Hole,\n\nSpear Phishing, Social Network Phishing, Torrent Phishing attacks and so on.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest spear phishing targeting a specific Korean was discovered in August of 2018 and interesting facts\n\nare found while analyzing the attack. In addition, the attacker is disguised as a corporate HR representative in Korea\n\nfor the attack.\n\nThe following IoCs are identified in the attack. ESRC has promptly shared the information with Korea Internet & Security\n\nAgency (KISA), in order to prevent the distribution of the malware.\n\n\n\n- http://m.ssbw.co.kr/admin/form_doc/image/down/down[.]php (MD5 : af6721145079a05da53c8d0f3656c65c)\n\n\n\n- http://m.ssbw.co.kr/admin/form_doc/image/down/worldnews[.]doc (MD5 :1213e5a0be1fbd9a7103ab08fe8ea5cb)\n\n\n\n- http://m.ssbw.co.kr/admin/form_doc/image/img/111[.]hwp (MD5 : edc1bdb2d70e36891826fdd58682b6c4)\n\n\n\n- http://m.ssbw.co.kr/admin/form_doc/image/img/Ant_3.5[.]exe (MD5 : b710e5a4ca00a52f6297a3cc7190393a)\n\n\n\n- http://m.ssbw.co.kr/admin/form_doc/image/img/desktops[.]ini (MD5 : 05eef00de73498167b2d7ebdc492c429)\n\n\nThe spear phishing strategy used by Geumseong121 contains the distinctive features. Instead of attaching a Lure or\n\nDecoy file, it adds the infected Korean website address and disguises as the attached file image.\n\nThe sophisticated Hangul was observed in the attack, but some geographic expressions of the language were subtlety\n\nvague. The approach is utilized to analyze local characteristics based on the linguistic abilities of the attacker, and the\n\nprofessional analysts who are good at using the language can access to more in-depth data through.\n\nIn addition, the metadata used in the attack is utilized as a key clue to the Correlations between traces of the past and\n\nthe infringements.\n\nThe malware disguised as the icon that seems the Korean security program is used in the newly discovered campaign\n\nin August. The tactic is similar to the one of the attack discovered in March, but this time it is disguised as security\n\nprogram for PC, not mobile.\n\nSecurity Response Center                                             7\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 3] Flow of Attack disguised as a security program\n\nThe malware disguised as a security program depending on the attack vector installs additional files through the\n\nmultiple steps. It executes optional commands for each .Net version.\n\nThe build data called 'Ant.pdb' is observed in malicious file distributed on the .Net basis. In particular, an attacker is\n\nconstantly creating a series of malicious file variants in a project folder called 'Rocket'.\n\n\n\n###### - E:\\project\\windows\\Rocket\\Ant\\Api\\PubnubApi\\obj\\Debug\\net35\\Pubnub.pdb\n\n\n\n###### - E:\\project\\windows\\Rocket\\Ant_3.5\\Ant\\obj\\Release\\Ant.pdb\n\n\nSecurity Response Center                                             8\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 3-1] PDB path created in Rocket path\n\nWe categorized the cyber campaigns using the main keywords and named it 'Operation Rocket Man'.\n\nESRC found many False Flags to confuse Threat Intelligence (TI) while analyzing the code used in the attack. The\n\n[attacker used the word 'Haizi'](https://dictionary.hantrainerpro.com/chinese-english/translation-haizi_child.htm) [in English, which means a child in Chinese expression.](https://dictionary.hantrainerpro.com/chinese-english/translation-haizi_child.htm)\n\nThe expression was identically used in the .Net based programs installed later. There is a word 'PAPA' in the .Net based\n\n[malware. However, 'BABA' is used as an English expression of Chinese, which means father.](https://dictionary.hantrainerpro.com/chinese-english/translation-baba_father.htm)\n\nThe evidence revealed that the attacker's native language may not be Chinese.\n\nSecurity Response Center                                             9\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 4] English expression of Chinese in the malware\n\n\nThe installed malware will download the encrypted ini configuration file and decrypt it. The configuration file is\n\n\nnamed 'desktops.ini' and receives the commands from the same C2 server exploiting the vulnerability attack.\n\n\n###### public void SetPubnub(string[] strArr)\n\n\n###### {\n\n\n###### if (strArr.Length != 7)\n\n\n###### {\n\n\n###### return;\n\n\n###### }\n\n\n###### for (int i = 0; i < strArr.Length; i++)\n\n\n###### {\n\n\n###### strArr[i] = this.calcXor(strArr[i], 23);\n\n\n###### }\n\n\n###### this.m_strChannelNameTmp = strArr[1];\n\n\nThe configuration file encrypted according to the command is decrypted with the key value of XOR 0x17.

The HWP vulnerability was also\n\nused for the attack, and the metadata is identical to the IOC of the attack on August 2018.\n\nThe attacker’s account name and the OLE code are disguised as references and reply to the original message.\n\n[Figure 6] E-mail used in the attack\n\nThe file name 'icloud.exe' is used for the malicious program and the following PDB (Program Data Base) code is inside.\n\n\n\n###### - E:\\))PROG\\doc_exe\\Release\\down_doc.pdb\n\n\nThe PDB series is diverse depending on the variant malicious files, and it is also related to the 2013 versions using the\n\nAOL messenger (AIM).\n\nAOL Messenger was used for communicating in the early days before the infected Korean websites were used as a\n\nSecurity Response Center                                             15\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunication method.

Some of them have been posted on\n\n[the blog](https://s.tencent.com/research/report/274.html) [by Chinese security company Tencent.](https://s.tencent.com/research/report/274.html)\n\n###### ■ Deep Analysis on Correlation\n\nA number of similar threat appeared in February of 2017. The domain endlesspaws.com was leveraged to distribute\n\nthe malware by luring the users with the safety guideline for strengthening the protection of North Korean defectors.\n\n[Figure 8] Distributing the malware by disguising as the safety guideline\n\nSecurity Response Center                                             17\n\n\n-----\n\nIt looks like it attaches a safety tips .zip file to an email, but it actually is linked to the endlesspaws.com domain to\n\ninstall a compressed file, and it contains malicious EXE executable files with a double extension disguised as an HWP\n\ndocument.\n\nIt masquerades as a double extension, and the icon is disguised as a normal HWP file by utilizing the document file\n\nresource.\n\nThe malicious file loads the code that is configured of the cryptographic function routines inside, and decodes certain\n\nhexadecimal codes into a logical XOR 0x55 key value.\n\nEXE executable malicious files will attempt to connect to the following addresses, same as the C2 domain used to\n\ndistribute ZIP compressed files:\n\n\n\n###### - http://endlesspaws.com/vog/tan[.]php?fuck=x\n\n\n\n###### - http://endlesspaws.com/vog/denk[.]zip\n\n\nSecurity Response Center                                             18\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 9] Code for converting the encrypted C2 data\n\nThe additionally downloaded 'denk.zip' file, which appears to be a seemingly zip compressed file, is actually a HWP\n\nformat document file.\n\nThe malware distributed in EXE format contains the normal HWP document inside. It shows users the normal\n\ndocument in the process of infecting the device or it can download the normal HWP document from the C2 server.\n\nHowever, this case is different from the common type of the malware. It downloads and install additional malicious\n\nHWP documents.\n\nThis is an unusual case of installing the additional document-based malicious files on the already infected system. As\n\nthe document file contains content that matches the email content used in the attack, it is not likely that the file is\n\nimproperly linked due to confusion with other cyber operations.\n\nSecurity Response Center                                             19\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious script code is injected in the DefaultJScript area in the denk.zip file.
