We said this explicitly in the original post but\nsome reports have suggested that the malware leaves no trace at all on the hard drive.\nWhile that is not the case, we do think “stealthy” is still an appropriate term to use with\nrespect to Linux/Cdorked.\n\n## How stealthy is Linux/Cdorked?\n\n\n-----\n\nFew blog posts on We Live Security have attracted the amount of attention accorded to\n[Linux/Cdorked.A: New Apache backdoor being used in the wild to serve Blackhole which](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/04/26/linuxcdorked-new-apache-backdoor-in-the-wild-serves-blackhole)\nPierre-Marc Bureau and his team posted last Friday. Their analysis of malware which they\ndubbed Linux/Cdorked.A, revealed “a sophisticated and stealthy backdoor meant to drive\ntraffic to malicious websites.”\n\nAfter reports of the malware appeared in numerous publications, questions were raised\nabout just how stealthy it was. Pierre-Marc and his team are preparing a follow-up post with\nadditional details about Linux/Cdorked and we think that will address a number of key\nquestions, but in the meantime we wanted to clarify the stealth factor. Here is what the\noriginal blog post said:\n\nThe backdoor leaves no traces of compromised hosts on the hard drive other than its\nmodified httpd binary, thereby complicating forensics analysis. All of the information\nrelated to the backdoor is stored in shared memory. The configuration is pushed by\nthe attacker through obfuscated HTTP requests that aren’t logged in normal Apache\nlogs. This means that no command and control information is stored anywhere on the\nsystem.\n\nNow, I think you will agree that’s pretty stealthy. Nowhere on the hard drive of the infected\nserver will you find the Linux/Cdorked payload, that is, the malicious code that the bad guys\nwant to run. In the sample we analyzed, the payload–which resides in memory, not on the\nhard drive–was redirecting web traffic, from the web server infected by Linux/Cdorked, to\nwebsites that seek to infect visitors via the Blackhole Exploit kit.\n\nWe also noted that the messages used by the bad guys to remotely activate and modify the\npayload are not logged in normal Apache logs. Furthermore, rebooting the system removes\nall trace of the payload. However, as stated earlier, we did not say that there is no trace of\nLinux/Cdorked.A on the server’s hard drive. We said there were no traces on the hard drive\n“other than its modified httpd binary“. In other words, there is a trace of this infection that\ncan be detected by monitoring changes to binaries on the server, or by scanning the files on\nthe server with an anti-malware program that can spot Linux/Cdorked.A (such a scan, for\n[example with ESET File Security for Linux, will flag the httpd binary).](http://www.eset.com/us/business/products/file-linux/)\n\n## An open Apache range\n\nSomething that emerged in the many valuable comments on Dan Goodin’s widely read\narticle about Linux/Cdorked in Ars Technica is the differing levels of expertise and resources\napplied to administering Apache web servers in different contexts.\n\nOn the one hand you have experienced sysadmins who were quick to point out that\n[changes to httpd would be detected by something like Tripwire, software that detects](http://www.tripwire.org/)\nunauthorized changes to files by creating checksums of them in a known good state, then\n\n\n-----\n\nroutinely comparing those checksums to production files. Some folks in this camp can t\nimagine running an Apache server without such security measures in place (including\nstoring copies of the checksums somewhere other than the server).\n\nOn the other hand there are potentially millions of websites running on Apache servers that\ncome preconfigured from hosting providers in ways that seriously complicate the use of\nsuch security measures by the server “owners,” many of whom have little knowledge of the\nfiner points of managing a Linux server. I would not be surprised to find that this particular\nsubset of Apache servers is being targeted by bad guys who well understand the\nimplications: greater probability of successful and persistent compromise.\n\nPlease stay tuned for more coverage.\n\n2 May 2013 - 08:01PM\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
