The use of two cryptonyms for this group exemplifies**\nhow this adversary has demonstrated two different motivations for conducting malicious\ncyber operations.\n\nWICKED PANDA refers to the targeted intrusion operations of the actor publicly known as\n“Winnti,” whereas WICKED SPIDER represents this group’s financially-motivated criminal\nactivity. Originally, WICKED SPIDER was observed exploiting a number of gaming\ncompanies and stealing code-signing certificates for use in other operations associated with\nthe malware known as Winnti. Now, Winnti is commonly associated with the interests of the\ngovernment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe flexibility of the cryptonym system used by CrowdStrike to track adversaries is\nhighlighted by the case of WICKED PANDA/SPIDER. In this instance, one set of activity\nassociated with criminal motivations can be easily separated from a second set of\nbehaviors by the same actor when operating in the interest of a nation-state.\n\nThe WICKED PANDA adversary makes use of a number of open-source and custom\n**tools to infect and move laterally in victim networks. Analysis of these tools and**\ninfrastructure linked to WICKED PANDA operations has traced these operations back to\ncontractors who count multiple Chinese government agencies as clients, including the\nMinistry of Public Security (MPS). Observed targeting by the WICKED PANDA adversary\nhas focused on high-value entities in the engineering, manufacturing and technology\nsectors, aligning with the PRC’s strategic economic plans. WICKED PANDA has also\ntargeted chemical and think tank sectors around the world.\n\nMost recently, our [cyber threat intelligence and proactive threat hunting teams identified](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)\nongoing activity by WICKED PANDA targeting organizations in the mining sector, where\nthey attempted to perform lateral movement and credential harvesting before being\ncontained by customer responders and the CrowdStrike Falcon® endpoint protection\nplatform.\n\nAs for WICKED SPIDER, earlier this year the Falcon OverWatch team identified malicious\nactivity on the network of a company operating in the technology sector. The incident\ninvolved the PlugX malware, as well as a scanning and exploitation tool for the\nETERNALBLUE vulnerability with support for DOUBLEPULSAR.\n\n## Wicked Spider’s Targets\n\nWICKED SPIDER has been observed targeting technology companies in Germany,\n**Indonesia, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the**\n**United States, and elsewhere. Notably, WICKED SPIDER has often targeted gaming**\ncompanies for their certificates, which can be used in future PRC-based operations to sign\nmalware. Ongoing analysis is still evaluating how these certificates are used — whether\nWICKED SPIDER hands the certificates off to other adversaries for use in future campaigns\nor stockpiles them for its own use.\n\n## Other Known Criminal Adversaries\n\n[Cobalt Spider](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-september-cobalt-spider/)\n[Dungeon Spider](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-october-dungeon-spider/)\n[Mummy Spider](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-february-mummy-spider/)\n\n**_Curious about other nation-state adversaries?_** _[Visit our threat actor center to learn about](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)_\n_the new adversaries that the CrowdStrike team discovers._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Want the insights on the latest adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures**\n**(TTPs)?
