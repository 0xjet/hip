One important development in NSM, along with\n[increasing emphasis on host-centric detection, is the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/articles/big-data/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-and-beyond.html)\n(ML/AI) mechanisms to analyze large, streaming datasets to identify items deviating from normal operations.\n[Such advances enable security anomaly detection, where a combination of ML/AI and advanced statistics](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/06/ADwithGraderFeedback.pdf)\n[generate alerts and alarms relevant to an underlying baseline of normal operations.](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/network-baseline-information-key-to-detecting-anomalies/d/d-id/1141121)\n\nAn anomaly-based approach to network defense and monitoring is very powerful, but the current perspective\nof anomaly detection is overly weighted toward statistical and ML/AI modeling techniques. While these items\nare expansive and will be increasingly useful as underlying datasets become ever larger, space still exists for\na more classic version of anomaly-driven detection.\n\nIn this post, we will examine an expanded conception of anomaly analysis to demonstrate how network\noperators and defenders still retain various options for monitoring and protecting their respective\nenvironments using a threat-focused, intelligence-driven approach to NSM and similar alerting.\n\n## Anomalies Defined and Reviewed\n\n[The idea of an “anomaly” is quite simple: something that deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anomaly)\nBased on this general definition, network anomalies would encompass items ranging from a newly resolved\ndomain, a never-before-seen user agent, or something more exotic such as a mismatch between\ncommunication protocol and standard port assignment.\n\nYet the idea of anomaly-based defense in NSM and related security disciplines increasingly is linked directly\nand exclusively to mathematical models for identifying anomalous trends in a large dataset. While this\napproach is certainly valuable and may over time prove to be the only viable approach to dealing with\nmassive datasets, this technique largely abandons contextuality in favor of mathematical speculation.\n\nML/AI-derived anomalies represent a deviation from a baseline. Such an approach can be very valuable in\nidentifying new or unusual traffic, but at the same time such events are confusing as their only reason for\nbeing interesting is their strangeness. Such strangeness can arise for several reasons: misconfiguration, a\n[change in operations, user error, or potentially malicious operations. Given a black box approach to ML/AI](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/f9kuryi8/release/6)\nanomaly identification, contextuality as to why a given item is even relevant — let alone a security concern —\nis lost.\n\nYet if we break free of a strictly mathematical view of potential security anomalies, several possibilities\nemerge. Looking at anomalies as more than just a statistical deviation, but as a meaningful, identifiable\nalteration from a normal state of affairs allows us to inject context and meaning into the event in question. In\n\n\n-----\n\nthis fashion, differentiating the simply weird from the concerning becomes possible because we can begin\nframing unusual events in light of how such an observation relates to pre- and post-event actions and how\nsuch an event may relate to an adversary’s intrusion lifecycle.\n\nIn this perspective, an anomaly becomes not just an observation deviating from a long-term baseline, but an\nitem that represents a change in operations that at the same time can be associated with potential malicious\nbehaviors. Searching for anomalies thus becomes enriched by understanding and projecting why such an\nanomalous, unusual occurrence matters. Such an outlook represents a refinement from a view of the simply\nstrange to the unusual, and potentially malicious, which reduces our corpus of possible events — but does so\nin a way that is useful since it redirects our focus to higher-confidence instances where such unusual events\ncan be highly correlated with behaviors associated with adversary operations.\n\nWhat we seek in this perspective is a refinement of anomaly to include observations that incorporate an\nunderstanding of adversary operations. By enriching our understanding of outlier events and anomalous\nnetwork occurrences to incorporate cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and similar perspectives, we can drive\nhigher value and higher confidence alerting on items of interest. Analysts and network defenders can then\ndevote energy towards exploring and investigating a likely malicious event, rather than focusing on first trying\nto determine whether a given occurrence is truly malicious, or merely weird but ultimately benign.\n\n## Examples of Network Anomalies for Detection Purposes\n\nThe above considerations are not merely theoretical in nature. Rather, adopting a CTI-enriched\nunderstanding of anomalies to incorporate perspectives on adversary operations unlocks powerful detection\npossibilities related to known techniques and campaigns. By exploring a few examples of such activity, we\ncan gain greater understanding of how the concept of an anomaly should be expanded to include detecting\nitems straying from the usual, but informed by CTI understanding of adversary operations and behaviors.\n\n### Sandworm Operations and Mismatches\n\n[In June 2020, the U.S. National Security Agency published a report on exploitation activity linked to a threat](https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/28/2002306626/-1/-1/0/CSA-Sandworm-Actors-Exploiting-Vulnerability-in-Exim-Transfer-Agent-20200528.pdf)\n[actor typically referred to as Sandworm.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/) [Subsequent analysis of this campaign revealed various actions](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/centreon-to-exim-and-back-on-the-trail-of-sandworm)\n[associated with this actor and the specific campaign targeting the Exim mail transfer agent (MTA). Reviewing](https://www.exim.org/)\nanalysis of this actor’s activity in this campaign, several mismatches in functionality or expected relationships\nemerge:\n\nUse of Windows-specific user agent strings for retrieval of follow-on payloads as part of malicious script\nexecution in likely Linux system environments\nLeveraging standard ports but using uncommon protocols or services on these ports for command and\ncontrol (C2) functionality\n\nWe observe the former in connection with a post-intrusion script executed by Sandworm:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Post-intrusion\n\nscript executed by Sandworm.\nAn anomalous situation emerges given the nature of communication in the above item. While the Exim MTA\nwill typically reside only on Linux servers, the script in question uses a hard-coded user agent string\nassociated with Windows workstations. Identifying this communication anomaly will allow a defender to spot\nthe C2 channel through the mismatch in system type and traffic information. If sufficient visibility and IT asset\nidentification exists, defenders can articulate alerts identifying functional mismatches for further investigation\nand analysis.\n\nFigure 2. Post\nexploitation Sandworm activity shows mismatch.\nIn addition to the user agent item, the above section of post-exploitation Sandworm activity shows another\ninteresting mismatch between expected and observed behavior. In this case, a hard-coded HTTP connection\nexists (again using a Windows-based user agent), but instead of using TCP 80 for communication, the\n[request leverages TCP 53 (typically associated with DNS zone transfers). Such activity could be used to](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5936)\nevade firewall or similar controls (as DNS is typically allowed outbound). But examination of traffic flow\ninformation would show a mismatch between protocol used (HTTP) and associated port (TCP 53). This type\nof mismatch would not be randomly occurring and can be highly correlated with evasive activity by an entity\nwithin the network. By detecting such traffic, defenders can identify not merely suspicious but likely malicious\nbehaviors for further response and investigation.\n\n### NOBELIUM and Unusual DNS Queries\n\n[Multiple](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) [entities identified a complex, long-running intrusion campaign leveraging a supply chain intrusion](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/)\nthrough [Solar Winds](https://www.solarwinds.com/) [Orion network monitoring software in December 2020. Subsequent](https://www.solarwinds.com/solutions/orion) [analysis, along with](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/01/08/cisa-releases-new-alert-post-compromise-threat-activity-microsoft)\n[labeling the adversary responsible as NOBELIUM, identified additional intrusion and lateral movement](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\nmechanisms leveraging adversary compromise of Microsoft Cloud and O365 environments. The combination\nof Microsoft and Solar Winds vectors for intrusion and access represent a formidable combination for\ndefenders to deal with — a situation made more complicated still given the adversary’s savvy use of network\ninfrastructure [to evade indicator-driven network defense and investigation.](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/change-in-perspective-on-the-utility-of-sunburst-related-network-indicators)\n\n[Examination of the Solar Winds Orion intrusion vector, labeled SUNBURST, reveals one key observable](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\nlinking all known events: use of a common initial C2 domain for victim identification and filtering. The domain,\navsvmcloud[.]com, was used to collect lengthy DNS requests, such as the below items observed in\n\n\n-----\n\nDomainTools Iris, that contained encoded victim information. Based on this information, the responding server\nwould then determine whether the victim would receive a CNAME response back to move events on to\nsecond-stage C2 infrastructure.\n\nFigure 3.\n\navsvmcloud[.]com was used to collect lengthy DNS requests.\nWhile a variety of careful, operations security-centric steps are made by NOBELIUM in establishing this\nnested C2 activity, the initial C2 beacon nonetheless stands out while linking first-stage infection vectors.\nWhile detecting anomalous DNS activity (long subdomains, DNS lookups followed by no actual traffic to the\nidentified resource, etc.) on its own may be insufficient for meaningful alerting, additional enrichment may\nenable higher-confidence assessments. For example, linking this DNS activity to the specific device\nresponsible, such as a Solar Winds Orion network monitoring server, can tie an anomalous network event to\nhigh-profile, high-value infrastructure. Such correlation, in this case based on functionality and context, serves\nto bubble up the merely anomalous to activity that requires investigation.\n\n### Large Archive Downloads for Analysis Evasion\n\n[NOBELIUM-linked activity continued in late May 2021 with a phishing campaign spoofing non-governmental](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\norganizations (NGOs) and other entities. For this campaign, the initial infection vector was a malicious link in\n[the NGO-spoofing email leading to an ISO optical disk image file.](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000348.shtml)\n\nFor reasons of efficiency and scalability, ISO file types (which are legitimately used for a number of purposes,\nincluding distributing operating system installation disks) are often excluded from active analysis (scanning\n[engines or sandboxing) because of their size. For example, a typical Linux installation ISO for Ubuntu is](https://releases.ubuntu.com/21.04/)\n[approximately 2.6 gigabytes in size, while Windows 10 ISO installers are typically larger than 3 gigabytes. To](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO)\navoid undue stress on security appliances, such files are therefore exempt from security analysis — allowing\nan entity such as NOBELIUM (among other adversaries) to use this visibility gap to transfer malware within\nan ISO archive.\n\nAs reported by multiple entities, NOBELIUM distributed malware as an ISO with several components inside: a\ndecoy document or PDF, a DLL containing the actual payload, and a LNK file that would handle execution of\nthe payload while displaying the decoy. While ISO files can (obviously) be of any size, what is notable about\nthe images distributed in this campaign is that they are relatively small, as shown in the samples provided in\nthe following table:\n\n**File Name** **File Hash** **File Size**\n\n\n-----\n\nICS-Declass.iso 2523f94bd4fba4af76f4411fe61084a7e7d80dec163c9ccba9226c80b8b31252 21.06\nMB\n\nICA-Declass.iso 94786066a64c0eb260a28a2959fcd31d63d175ade8b05ae682d3f6f9b2a5a916 21.06MB\n\nICA-Declass.iso 324c9201b71c9e62dc7120a0e010617039ea6a25df0d1fee9eaa1fbd3e87bff1 5.28 MB\n\nICA-Declass.iso 54923793beb5d51261effaf636e3b95c64f38daeca8594fb72ad278844ce2eac 12.64\nMB\n\nICA-Declass.iso b36823cea4ef39b9a30efb57d6db1c1dc15f2e65d16af217b554506cb7ee7bbe 10 MB\n\nICA-Declass.iso d035d394a82ae1e44b25e273f99eae8e2369da828d6b6fdb95076fd3eb5de142 10 MB\n\nDOCUMENTS.iso 6e2069758228e8d69f8c0a82a88ca7433a0a71076c9b1cb0d4646ba8236edf23 1.19 MB\n\nReply slip.iso f006af714379fdd63923536d908f916f4c55480f3d07adadd53d5807e0c285ee 1.19 MB\n\nWhereas typical ISOs are often measured in gigabytes, these items at most come in at a little over 20\nmegabytes. As such, an anomaly can be identified in this behavior: retrieval of relatively small ISO files, and\nin this case from likely new (to the victim) network infrastructure. This combination of anomalous observations\n— odd file given file type and newly observed network infrastructure — can be used as an identifier for activity\nthat requires further analysis and investigation.\n\n## Context-Driven Anomalies and Enabling Response\n\nA threat-centric, intelligence-driven approach to anomalies also enables response due to greater contextuality\nand background understanding of suspicious activity. In identifying an anomalous object given a known,\nidentifiable behavioral deviation, defenders can now ask relevant questions as to how the observation\nmanifested and toward what it likely leads. This stands in contrast to the approach in most black-box\nmathematical model identifications, where significant effort must first be expended to determine whether the\nodd observation is even suspicious (or malicious) before considering what comes next.\n\nThus, in a behavior-aware, intelligence-driven perspective for identifying anomalies relevant to networknormal behaviors, possibilities emerge for guiding investigation and response post-detection. Frequently\n[described as playbooks within the security industry, incident response (IR) personnel can leverage pre-](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/it-teams/how-to-create-an-incident-response-playbook)\ndetermined, historically relevant follow-on actions to pursue a detection after it emerges. Since the triggering\nanomaly is strange because of context and operation relative to the network and potential adversary actions,\nIR actions can be focused toward known-valuable investigative paths.\n\nEnabling IR and defensive operations is a goal for many organizations to better utilize and direct limited\nresources. By ensuring an intelligence and contextual perspective for security detections, such as an\nenriched identification of anomalies, organizations can meaningfully enable such a posture. In doing so, asset\nowners and decision makers create a more focused, rapid response to malicious activity, minimizing\nadversary dwell time and improving defender identification and response metrics.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe concept of a security anomaly has been debased due to the exclusive focus on mathematical and\nstatistical model identification of odd events in network security as the only perceived manner of implementing\nsuch an approach.\n\nThrough reevaluation of the anomaly concept, we find possibilities for contextual, behavior-driven variants\nthat allow defenders and responders to rapidly triage and transition initial observations toward highconfidence security alerts. By adopting this enriched conception, we as network security professionals can\nreclaim the idea of anomalous events from black-box modeling and reintroduce it to fundamental security\nmonitoring and response. In doing so, we will enable a more focused, more accurate means to respond to\nsecurity events as they occur, while significantly reducing wasteful actions in response to events that are\nmerely odd but fundamentally benign.\n\n**Featured Webinars**\n[Hear from our experts on the latest trends and best practices to optimize your network visibility and analysis.](https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/webinar-hub.html?intcid=blog)\n\nCONTINUE THE DISCUSSION\n\nPeople are talking about this in the Gigamon Community’s [Network Detection and Response group.](https://community.gigamon.com/gigamoncp/s/group/0F91O0000009cbJSAQ/network-detection-response-ndr)\n\n**Share your thoughts today**\n\n## RELATED CONTENT\n\nREPORT\n\n2022 Ransomware Defense Report\n\nGET YOUR COPY\n\nWEBINAR\n\nThreatINSIGHT: Eliminating Adversaries’ Dwell Time Advantage\n\nWATCH ON DEMAND\n\nWEBINAR\n\nDeep Dive INSIGHTS: Fighting Ransomware and Shifting Security Priorities\n\nWATCH ON DEMAND\n\nREPORT\n\n\n-----\n\nGigamon ThreatINSIGHT Guided SaaS Network Detection and Response\n\nGET YOUR COPY\n\nOLDER ARTICLE\n[Partner Spotlight: Digital Scepter and Gigamon Help Customers Get the Most from Their Security Tools](https://blog.gigamon.com/2021/07/27/partner-spotlight-digital-scepter-and-gigamon-help-customers-get-the-most-from-their-security-tools/)\nNEWER ARTICLE\n[Gigamon ThreatINSIGHT: How Not to Ignore the “R” in NDR](https://blog.gigamon.com/2021/07/29/gigamon-threatinsight-how-not-to-ignore-the-r-in-ndr/)\n\n\n-----",
