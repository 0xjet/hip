The seller has been actively promoting the malware since April 2022. In August of that year, the\nseller posted a new promotional article under the name LummaC Stealer. Then, the seller continuously\nupdates the malware, including changing its name to LummaC2 Stealer, as seen in a post title from\nDecember 2022.\n\nFigure 1. Activity history of LummaC users\nFigure 2. LummaC2 Stealer promotional post\n\n## Seller Information\n\nNot only the underground forum, but the seller also uses Telegram to notify users of updates to the\nmalware and to respond to inquiries. The seller also operates a separate website for selling the malware.\nThe Telegram channels operated by the seller are divided into different categories, such as providing\nupdated information, offering support, and allowing users to report bugs.\n\n@LummaC2Stealer: Channel for updated information\n@lummaseller126: Channel for offering support\n@Lummanowork: Channel for reporting bugs\n\nTable 1. Terelgram channels operated by Lumma Stealer sellers\n\n## Price Policy\n\nThe seller has created their own website to sell the malware and has set different functions and pricing\npolicies depending on the type of level. According to a promotional post on the underground forum, the\nseller also offers the ability to install a control panel on the server when using the corporate level of the\nservice.\n\nFigure 3. Pricing policies and supported cryptocurrency for trading\nPayment for the Lumma Stealer is made through Coinbase, and a unique coin address is generated and\nprovided for each payment.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 2. Features by pricing policy\n\n## Targeted a voice actor YouTuber in South Korea\n\nOn February 6, 2023, a voice actor YouTuber in Korea received an e-mail impersonating a Bandai\nNamco game company. The e-mail embedded a Dropbox link downloading malware, then the YouTuber\ndownloaded the malware and executed it. Later, his YouTube channel was compromised and changed to\na Tesla US channel.\n\nFortunately, the YouTuber was able to regain access to his compromised account and posted a video\n[explaining how the attack had taken place. Thanks to the information provided by him, we were able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI9fwFEU8z0)\nobtain the original spear-phishing email and malware from VirusTotal. We would like to express our\ngratitude to him for their bravery in sharing the details of the attack and helping to uncover the truth.\n\nBased on our analysis, we have identified the following attack flow:\n\n1. The attacker sends a spear-phishing email targeting the YouTuber.\n2. Downloads a ZIP file containing malware via the Dropbox link in the spear-phishing email.\n3. Executes the malware, which is disguised as a PDF document inside the ZIP file.\n4. The malware downloads additional malware from the command and control (C&C) server.\n5. The malware loads the additional malware, Pure Crypter.\n6. The Pure Crypter injects the Lumma Stealer into the process.\n7. The Lumma Stealer steals information from the victim’s system and sends it to the C&C server.\n\nFigure 4. Lumma Stealer infection and execution flow\nIt has been confirmed that the victim’s YouTube account, which was infected with Lumma Stealer, was\nhacked and the channel name was changed to “Tesla US”.\n\nFigure 5. Victim’s YouTube channel changed to the Tesla advertising account\n\nThe channel name and thumbnail changed, but the previously uploaded channel notices not\nchanged.\n\n## Distributed via Spear-phishing\n\nThe e-mail used the “bandai.namco.ma[@]kakao.com” account to impersonate Bandai Namco game\ncompany. The email requested the victim’s cooperation in promoting a new game and urged them to\ndownload and execute the file via the Dropbox link included in the email.\n\nTitle : Re: Bandai Namco YT Offer 2023\nSender : bandai.namco.ma[@]kakao.com\n\nAlthough Bandai Namco is a Japanese company, the email was sent through the account from\nkakao.com, one of the most used mail domains in Korea. As the targeted YouTuber is also Korean, we\nassess with low-confidence that there is a possibility that the attacker is also Korean.\n\nFigure 6. A phishing email masquerading as a game company (Source: Victim’s YouTube channel)\nThe file downloaded through the Dropbox link contained a normal video file and a malicious file\ndisguising a PDF document. Once executed, additional malware is downloaded from the C&C server,\nand Lumma Stealer is finally installed.\n\n\n-----\n\nDownloaded filename from Dropbox: One Piece Odyssey Youtube Deal.zip\nDropbox Link:\nhxxps[:]//www.dropbox[.]com/s/rcrreonkI7d0ah9/One%20Piece%20Odyssey%20Youtube%20Deal.zip?\ndl=1\n\nFigure 7. Malicious attachments in the phishing email\n\n## Pure Crypter\n\nUpon analyzing the downloaded from the C&C server, it was identified as a Pure Crypter. Pure Crpyter is\na tool written in C# and developed by an individual known as “PureCoder,” which is available for sale on\nunderground forums in the form of software as a service (SaaS). This tool includes features designed to\nbypass security products, including obfuscation and process injection, and is commonly used to drop\nadditional malware.\n\nTable 3. Features provided by Pure Crypter\nFigure 8. Pure Crypter sales site\nThe Pure Crypter reads the separate data included within and then decrypts it to obtain configuration\nvalues for performing malicious actions set as desired.\n\nTable 4. Fields in configuration\n```\n{\"1\":0,\"2\":\"Itself\",\"3\":\"\",\"4\":false,\"5\":\"Vszbhncwjwcaklzwbvyio\",\"6\":\n{\"1\":false,\"2\":false,\"3\":null,\"4\":null,\"5\":false},\"7\":\n{\"1\":false,\"2\":0,\"3\":0,\"4\":null},\"8\":false,\"9\":false,\"10\":false,\"11\":0,\"12\":null,\"13\":false,\"14\":\n2022.4.enUS.win64.installer.exe\",\"22\":false,\"23\":false,\"24\":false,\"25\":0,\"26\":false,\"27\":null,\"28\":null,\"2\n\n```\nAfter extracting the configuration values, an additional malware payload is read from the resource and\ndecrypted. In this case, the Lumma Stealer malware is loaded and injected into a separate process for\nexecution. If the file name specified in the injection-related configuration does not exist, Pure Crypter\nperforms injection using the Process Hollowing technique in the current process.\n\n## Stolen Information via Lumma Stealer\n\nThe types of information that the finally executed Lumma Stealer steals are as follows.\n\nTable 5.

To disguise\nthe communication as browser traffic, the Tesla Browser is set as the User-Agent.\n\nFigure 9. Exfiltration traffic\nThe Admin Panel of Lumma Stealer is as follows. As explained in an advertisement in the forum, the\npanel has functions such as damage status by country, infection status, number of items stolen, and\ndownloading log files.\n\nFigure 10.
