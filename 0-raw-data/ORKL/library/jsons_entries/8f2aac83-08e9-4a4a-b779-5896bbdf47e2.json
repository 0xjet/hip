These findings also\n\nprovide baseline data from which the results of future annual surveys can be compared, to help ascertain\n\noverall trends.\n\nImportantly, business is taking cyber security seriously. This is paramount for the security of the individual\n\norganisation and its clients, as well as the industry sector, and the business community more broadly.\n\nHowever, the survey results also indicate that many organisations are not confident that cyber security is\n\nsufficiently understood and appreciated by staff, management and boards.\n\nIn terms of cyber security incidents, more than half the organisations considered attacks on their organisation\n\nto be targeted. This indicates a shift from previous views or conceptions, that most attacks are non-targeted\n\nor indiscriminate. And while the majority of attacks were reported to come from external sources, the fact\n\nthat 44% originated from within organisations serves as a reminder that internally-focused cyber security\n\ncontrols and measures are also important.\n\nReporting of cyber security incidents – which is critical to the effectiveness of the government-business\n\npartnership – clearly requires further attention. The CERT needs to articulate to business the benefits of\n\nreporting cyber security incidents to CERT Australia and to law enforcement, and that all information provided\n\nto the CERT is held in the strictest confidence.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key findings\n\nThe key findings for this survey include:\n\n� over 90% of respondents deployed firewalls, anti-spam filters and anti-virus software\n\n� \u0007two-thirds of respondents had documented incident management plans, however only 12% had a\n\nforensic plan\n\n� nearly two-thirds of organisations used IT security related standards\n\n� over two-thirds of respondents had staff with tertiary level IT security qualifications. Over half had vendor\n\nIT security certifications, whilst just under half had non-vendor IT security certifications\n\n� over 20% of organisations know they experienced a cyber incident in the previous 12 months, with 20%\n\nof these organisations experiencing more than 10 incidents.\n\nOf the organisations which know they experienced cyber incidents:\n\n� 17% suffered from loss of confidential or proprietary information, 16% encountered a denial-of-service\n\nattack, and 10% financial fraud\n\n� 44% reported the incident to a law enforcement agency, whereas only 13% sought a civil remedy\n\nthrough action from legal counsel\n\n� 20% chose not to report the matter to a law enforcement agency because of the fear of negative publicity\n\n� the most common responses as to why incidents were successful, were that they used powerful\n\nautomated attack tools, or exploited unpatched or unprotected software vulnerabilities or misconfigured\n\noperating systems, applications or network devices\n\n� over half of all organisations have increased their expenditure on IT security in the previous 12 months.\n\n\n### Over 90% of respondents deployed firewalls, anti-spam filters and anti-virus software\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction_\n\n### The 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey: Systems of National Interest was commissioned by Australia’s national computer emergency response team, CERT Australia (the CERT), part of the Federal Attorney-General’s Department.\n\nThis report provides analysis of the findings, and identifies areas for further exploration or improvement\n\nwhich may be addressed in future surveys. As there was a strong response rate of almost 60% for this\n\ninaugural survey, the findings are considered to be representative of this particular sample. The strong\n\nresponse rate also indicates a good level of trust between the CERT and its business partners.\n\nEstablished in 2010, the CERT works with the Australian business sector – primarily the owners and\n\noperators of systems of national interest. These are the businesses that underpin the social and economic\n\nwellbeing of the nation and the economy, such as banking and finance, communications, energy, resources,\n\ntransport and water.\n\nThe CERT provides cyber security threat and vulnerability information to help these businesses manage\n\nrisk, as well as providing support with incident response. The CERT is also a member of the Cyber Security\n\nOperations Centre and the global CERT community. By using its government, international and industry\n\nnetworks, the CERT seeks to provide the most effective and timely advice and assistance possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n## About the survey_\n\nThe survey was designed to obtain a better picture of how cyber incidents are affecting the businesses\n\nthat partner with the CERT. It was produced by the Centre for Internet Safety at the University of Canberra.\n\nMore information on the Centre can be found at www.canberra.edu.au/cis. The Centre was created to foster\n\na safer, more trusted internet by providing thought leadership and policy advice on the social, legal, political\n\nand economic impacts of cybercrime and threats to cyber security. The survey was hosted by the Online\n\nResearch Unit.\n\nParticipating organisations were asked that an appropriate person complete the survey, and were assured\n\nthat all responses are anonymous.\n\nThe survey consisted of 24 questions, both closed and open ended, to ascertain:\n\n� business description\n\n� types of IT security used\n\n� types of cyber security incidents experienced, and\n\n� industry reporting of incidents.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Respondents_\n\n\n### The strong response rate of almost 60% reflects the trusted relationship CERT Australia has with its business partners\n\n\nOf the almost 450 organisations contacted, responses were received from 255, which is approximately 60%.\n\nThis is a strong response rate and reflects the trusted relationship the CERT has with its business partners.\n\nIt also reflects the willingness of business to participate in a survey that will help government and improve\n\nunderstanding of the cyber security threat environment in Australia.\n\n### Industry sector\n\nMore than 11 industry sectors responded, with the greatest representation being from energy (17%),\n\ndefence industry (15%), communications (12%), banking and finance (9%) and water (9%).\n\nFigure 1 provides a breakdown of the sectors – with ‘government’ referring to state-owned enterprises and\n\n‘other’ referring to companies from aviation/aerospace, business services and insurance.\n\nFigure_01 – breakdown of respondents by industry sector\n\nBanking & finance\nEnergy\nCommunications\nFood\nHealth\nTransport\nWater\nGovernment\nMining\nDefence industry\nOther\n\n\n-----\n\n### Trusted Information Sharing Network\n\nThe Trusted Information Sharing Network for Critical Infrastructure Resilience (TISN) is led by the Federal\n\nAttorney-General’s Department. It provides an environment where business and government can share\n\ninformation on security issues relevant to the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure, and the\n\ncontinuity of essential services in the face of all hazards. The TISN has seven main sector groups – banking\n\nand finance, communications, food, energy, health, transport and water.\n\nDisruption of Australia’s systems of national interest or critical infrastructure could have a range of serious\n\nimplications for business, governments and the community. It is vital that owners and operators of these\n\nimportant organisations, both in the private and public sector, are able to plan for, withstand and respond to a\n\nbroad range of threats, including cyber attacks from outside and inside their organisation.\n\nOne third of respondents reported their organisation to be a member of the TISN. This included organisations\n\nfrom banking, energy, communications, transport and water. This provides a mostly representative picture of\n\nthe TISN sectors that partner with the CERT. One third of respondents reported their organisation was not a\n\nmember of the TISN, while one third of respondents did not know if their organisation is a member.\n\nFigure 2 provides a breakdown of industry sectors, according to whether or not the respondent identified the\n\norganisation as being a member of the TISN.\n\nFigure_02 – breakdown of industry sectors identifying as members of the TISN\n\nEnergy\n\nWater\nBanking & finance\nTransport\n\nCommunications\n\nDefence industry\n\nGovernment\n\nHealth\n\nOther\n\nMining\n\nFood\n\n\nYes\nNo\nDon’t Know\n\n\n-----\n\n## Security of IT systems_\n\nSecurity of IT systems centers on preventing and detecting the unauthorised access to or use of IT systems\n\nor impairment of those systems. To achieve such security, modern organisations layer security defences in IT\n\nsystems to reduce the chance of a successful attack. This concept is known as defence-in-depth and seeks\n\nto manage risk with multiple defensive strategies, so that if one layer of defence turns out to be inadequate,\n\nanother layer of defence will hopefully prevent a full breach. The multiple defence mechanisms layered across\n\nan organisation’s network infrastructure protect data, networks, and users. A well-designed and implemented\n\ndefence-in-depth strategy can help system administrators identify internal and external attacks on a computer\n\nsystem or network.\n\n### IT security technology\n\nOrganisations were asked what type of computer security technologies they used. More than 90% of\n\nrespondents reported using antivirus software, spam filters, and firewalls. More than 80% also reported\n\nusing access control and virtual private networks (VPNs).\n\nIT security technology such as firewalls and spam filters are not always effective in preventing or detecting\n\nsophisticated attacks, so security techniques are increasingly incorporating the use of intrusion detection\n\nsystems (IDS). Almost 60% of respondents reported using a type of IDS.\n\nAlmost half the respondents also reported deploying reusable passwords and multifactor authentication\n\ntechnologies such as biometrics, smartcards and tokens.\n\nThese results indicate that some organisations may need to strengthen their IT security, by adopting a\n\ndefence-in-depth approach.\n\nFigure 3 provides a breakdown of the security technology being used by respondents.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure_03 – breakdown of security technology used\n\nAnti-virus software\n\nFirewalls\n\nAnti-spam filters\n\nAccess control\n\nVPNs\n\nDigital certificates\nEncrypted login/sessions\n\nIntrusion detection systems\nEncrypted files\n\nBiometrics, smart cards/tokens\nReusable passwords\n\nDon’t know\nNone of these\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n\n-----\n\n### basic security policies are being applied by the majority of surveyed organisations\n\n\n### IT security policy\n\nAccording to respondents, basic security policies are being applied by the majority of surveyed organisations.\n\nFor example, 84% deploy user access management, 79% perform media backup, 75% use documented\n\nstandard operating procedures, and 73% have external network access control.\n\nResults indicate there are areas for improvement. For example, less than 50% of respondents have plans in\n\nplace for the management of removable computer media, such as USB memory drives, and less than 25%\n\nhave policies and procedures in place for using cryptographic controls.\n\nIn addition, less than 12% of respondents reported having a forensic plan in place. These plans help monitor use of\n\nthe ICT systems, provide mechanisms to recover lost data, and provide ways to protect information on systems.\n\nFigure 4 provides a breakdown of the security policies being used by respondents.\n\nFigure_04 – breakdown of security policies in place\n\nUser access management\n\nMedia backup\n\nDocumented standard operating procedures\n\nExternal network access control\n\nChange control\n\nControls against malicious software\n\nBusiness continuity management\n\nIncident management\n\nMonitoring system access and use\nClock synchronisation\n\nSystem auditing\n\nManagement of removable computer media\n\nPolicy and procedures for use of cryptographic controls\n\nForensic plan\n\nDon’t know\nNone of these\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n\n-----\n\n### IT security standards\n\nOverall, 64% of respondents reported their organisation did apply IT security standards or guidelines.\n\nOf the remaining respondents, 25% reported their organisation did not apply IT security standards or\n\nguidelines, and 11% did not know. These findings are a concern and warrant future investigation.\n\nFigure 5 provides a breakdown of industry sectors and their use of IT security standards or guidelines.\n\nFigure_05 – breakdown of industry sectors and standards\n\nFood\n\nBanking & finance\nEnergy\n\nOther\n\nWater\n\nHealth\n\nCommunications\n\nTransport\n\nGovernment\nMining\n\nDefence industry\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nYes No Don’t know\n\n\n-----\n\n### It’s important to take cyber security seriously… layer security defences in  IT systems\n\n\nOf the respondents who reported their organisation did apply some form of IT security standard, almost 50%\n\nfollowed or used as a guide, the ISO 27001. This standard states it is mandatory for management to examine\n\ntheir organisation’s IT security risks to form a risk mitigation system, and to ensure that the controls applied\n\nare current for the needs of the business.\n\nOf this same subset of respondents, just over 20% reported their organisation adhered to the Payment Card\n\nIndustry Data Security Standard (PCI DDS). This is the IT security standard commonly used by organisations\n\nusing credit card data. In addition, just over 15% used a vendor specific standard.\n\n### IT security qualifications\n\nResponses indicated that 65% of participating organisations had IT security staff with tertiary level IT\n\nqualifications. More than 50% of participating organisations had IT security staff with some type of vendor\n\nbased IT certifications. Almost 35% of participating organisations had IT security staff with no formal training,\n\nalthough most of these staff had more than five years working in the IT security industry.\n\nFigure_06 – IT security qualifications of IT staff\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\nTertiarty IT Vendor IT Ad hoc Vendor Vendor neutral No formal Do not know None of the\nqualifications certifications IT training IT security IT security qualifications above\n\n(MCSE, CCNA, security certifications certifications but at least\nt ) (Ch k i t (CREST SANS 5\n\n\n-----\n\nThese findings indicate that some organisations may need to improve the skill set of their IT security staff.\n\nThis was supported by the additional finding that 55% of respondents thought their organisation needs to do more\n\nto ensure their IT security staff have an appropriate level of qualification, training, experience and awareness.\n\nThese findings indicate that respondents are aware of the need for IT security staff to keep their skills and\n\nknowledge up to date – which is essential, as cyber threats are constantly evolving.\n\nRespondents also thought their organisation needs to do more to ensure other staff have an appropriate level\n\nof IT skill and awareness:\n\n� 70% of respondents reported this need for general staff\n\n� 70% of respondents reported this need for management, and\n\n� 48% of respondents reported this need for their board of directors.\n\nThese findings indicate that respondents are aware that cyber security is a shared responsibility. Even where\n\nnetworks are secure at the perimeter, security is dependent on all staff being aware of vulnerabilities such as\n\nphishing attacks. This is a method used to penetrate organisations without needing to breach IT security defences,\n\nby attempting to get staff to divulge information and provide access – unwittingly – to corporate systems.\n\nThese findings also indicate that many organisations are not confident that cyber security is sufficiently\n\nunderstood and appreciated by staff, management and boards.\n\nFigure 7 provides a breakdown of organisational staff and respondents’ views on the need for the\n\norganisation to do more to ensure they have an appropriate level of IT security skill and awareness.\n\nFigure_07 – breakdown of staff and need to ensure appropriate IT security skill\n\nGeneral staff\n\nManagers\n\nIT staff\n\nDirectors\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n\n### respondents are aware of the need for IT security staff to keep their skills and knowledge up to date\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cyber incidents_\n\n\n### Respondents were asked about the types of cyber security incidents their organisation had experienced...\n\n\nRespondents were asked about the types of cyber security incidents their organisation had experienced in the\n\nprevious 12 months, as well as possible motives for the attacks, and why the attacks may have been successful.\n\nA cyber security incident was classified as an electronic attack that harmed the confidentiality, integrity or\n\navailability of the organisation’s network data or systems.\n\n\nFigure_08 – \u0007organisations that\nexperienced one or more\ncyber incidents\n\nYes\nNo\nDo not know\n\n\nFigure_09 – \u0007breakdown of number of\n\nincidents experienced\n\n1 to 5\n6 to 10\n10+\nDo not know\n\n\n-----\n\n### Number of incidents experienced\n\nWhen asked if their organisation had experienced a cyber security incident in the previous 12 months:\n\n� 69% of respondents reported ‘no’\n\n� 22% of respondents reported ‘yes’, and\n\n� 9% of respondents reported they ‘did not know’.\n\nWhile these results indicate the majority of organisations did not experience a cyber incident in the previous\n\n12 months, this may more accurately reflect that a number of cyber intrusions have gone undetected by\n\nsome organisations. Anecdotal evidence available to the CERT suggests that some businesses are unaware\n\nof the full scope of unauthorised activity on their networks.\n\nThe CERT is also aware of hesitation from organisations to report a cyber security incident. This may be for a\n\nvariety of reasons – some are concerned that the information they report may lead to negative publicity and/\n\nor regulatory scrutiny, others don’t consider reporting to be worthwhile.\n\nOf the respondents who reported their organisation had experienced an incident in the previous 12 months:\n\n� 65% reported experiencing one to five incidents\n\n� 21% reported experiencing more than 10 incidents\n\n� 9% reported experiencing six to 10 incidents, and\n\n� 5% did not know how many incidents had been experienced.\n\nFigure 9 provides a percentage breakdown of the number of cyber security incidents experienced by\n\norganisations in the previous 12 months.\n\n\n-----\n\n### These findings may help organisations decide where to place additional resources to protect their information assets\n\n\n### Types of incidents experienced\n\nOf the respondents who reported their organisation had experienced a cyber incident in the previous\n\n12 months, the main types reported were:\n\n� theft of a notebook, tablet or mobile devices – 32%\n\n� virus or worm infection – 28%\n\n� trojan or rootkit malware – 21%\n\n� unauthorised access – 18%\n\n� theft or breach of confidential information – 17%, and\n\n� denial-of-service attack – 16%.\n\nThese findings may help organisations decide where to place additional resources to protect their information\n\nassets. The high percentage of physical computing assets being stolen highlights the need for physical\n\nsecurity measures to be included in an organisation’s security risk management plan.\n\nInterestingly, although respondents were provided with 13 specific types of incident from which to choose –\n\n34% of respondents reported the incidents their organisation had experienced were ‘none of the above’. As\n\nthe types of incident were comprehensively listed, this finding may be due to the respondent not knowing\n\nwhat type of incident was actually experienced.\n\nFigure 10 provides a breakdown of the type of cyber security incidents experienced by organisations in the\n\nprevious 12 months.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure_10 – breakdown of type of incidents experienced\n\nTheft of computing device\n\nVirus or worm\nTrojan or rootkit\n\nUnauthorised access\n\nTheft / breach of information\n\nDenial of service attack\n\nUnauthorised privileged access\n\nDegradation of network\n\nComputer facilitated financial fraud\n\nSystem penetration\n\nWeb site defacement\n\nTheft of customer information\nInterception of telecommunications\n\nNone of the above\n\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35%\n\nOf the respondents who knew they had suffered electronic attack, 71% reported they had been subject to\n\nbetween 1 and 5 external attacks, whilst 44% reported they had been subject to between 1 and 5 internal\n\nattacks. Many companies spend the majority of their IT security budget on protection from external attacks. But\n\nthe figures above serve as a reminder that internal controls and measures are also important, to ensure that\n\ninternal risks are also managed. Should they have sufficient motivation – financial, personal or cause-related –\n\ninternal employees, whether they are permanent or casual staff or contractors, can have access to sensitive\n\ninformation and the opportunity to understand critical systems and exploit potential weaknesses in security.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Building resilience to cyber security incidents requires constant vigilance by IT security staff\n\n\n### Motives for the attacks\n\nRespondents were asked what they thought the motives for the incidents were. The highest suspected motive\n\nwas non-targeted unsolicited malicious damage (17%), followed by indiscriminate attack (almost 16%).\n\nInterestingly, more than half the respondents viewed the attacks to be targeted at their organisation – with\n\nmotives being illicit financial gain (15%), hactivism (9%), using the system for further attacks (9%), using the\n\nsystem for personal use (6%), being from a foreign government (5%), personal grievance (5%), and being a\n\ncompetitor (4%).\n\nThis finding indicates a shift from previous views or conceptions, that most attacks are non-targeted or\n\nindiscriminate.\n\nEither way, building resilience to cyber security incidents requires constant vigilance by IT security staff, in\n\norder to create and apply current and efficient risk treatments.\n\nAttribution is always difficult. Where respondents think an attack may have come from, may not be where it actually\n\ncame from. What’s important is that an organisation understands enough about attacks so they can work out:\n\n� the vulnerabilities on their network exploited by the attacker\n\n� what data may have been accessed, and\n\n� what needs to be done to increase the protections of that network.\n\nFigure 11 provides a breakdown of suspected motives for cyber security incidents experienced by\n\norganisations in the previous 12 months.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure_11 – breakdown of motives for incidents experienced\n\nUnsolicited malicious damage\n\nIndiscriminate\n\nIllicit financial gain\n\nDemonstrate attacker skills\n\nHactivism\n\nUse system for further attacks\n\nUse system for personal use\n\nForeign government\n\nPersonal grievance\n\nCompetitor\n\nUnknown\n\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20%\n\n\n-----\n\n### The victims were then asked by the attacker to pay a fine using a payment or money transfer service...\n\n\n### case study – Ransomware_\n\nIn late September 2012, CERT Australia received a series of calls from more than 25 organisations being\n\ntargeted by ransomware.\n\nThe attacks encrypted files on the compromised system and/or locked the victim out of the desktop\n\nenvironment. The attacks also encrypted files in the system backups.\n\nThe victims were then asked by the attacker to pay a fine using a payment or money transfer service, to\n\nobtain the codes that would unlock the computer and/or decrypt the data.\n\nIn some cases, the ransomware included scareware, displaying a fake warning screen, claiming that the victim’s\n\ncomputer had been associated with criminal activity. This was a tactic to discourage the victim from reporting\n\nthe attacks to law enforcement agencies or the CERT. For example, one warning screen was set up to look like\n\nit was from the Anti Cyber Crime Department of the Federal Internet Security Agency. There is no such agency.\n\nIn the majority of cases, the attackers used Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol as an entry point to the\n\ntarget network. This was possibly using authentication credentials obtained by key loggers, or accessing\n\nsystems with weak credentials.\n\nThe severity of the damage done by the attacks varied across the target organisations. In the worst case scenario\n\nreported to the CERT, one victim lost 15 years’ worth of critical business data, which is a serious compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo how does the CERT help business deal with such attacks?\n\nFirstly, it worked directly with the affected organisation to help it better defend against the attack. Where the\n\norganisation had outsourced management of its website, the CERT helped the service provider protect the\n\naffected network.\n\nThe CERT also worked with law enforcement locally – because of the criminal nature of the activity;\n\nMicrosoft – to share data and analysis; and international colleagues – as the threat actors or attackers used\n\ninfrastructure based overseas.\n\nIn addition, the CERT identified other organisations in Australia that had not yet reported the activity. It then\n\ncontacted them to warn the attacks were happening in their sector, and then gave them advice about how to\n\nprotect their systems.\n\nThe CERT also issued a guidance paper on the ransomware threat, which was made publicly available on\n\nits website.\n\nThis case study highlights the nature of CERT Australia’s mission – it’s all about helping business best prepare\n\nfor and respond to cyber attacks. It does this by using its government, industry and international partnerships\n\nto provide the most useful advice possible – as soon as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n### These findings highlight the need for organisations to stay vigilant to vulnerabilities...\n\n\n### Contributing factors to the attacks\n\nRespondents were asked what factors they thought may have contributed to the incidents. The highest\n\nrated reason was the use of powerful automated attack tools (14%), followed by exploitation of unpatched or\n\nunprotected software vulnerabilities (11%), and exploitation of misconfigured operating systems, applications\n\nor network devices (10%).\n\nThese findings highlight the need for organisations to stay vigilant to vulnerabilities and apply appropriate\n\nmitigations – specifically where misconfigured systems are the reason an attack was successful.\n\nFigure 12 provides a breakdown of respondents’ views on contributing factors to cyber incidents.\n\nFigure_12 – breakdown of contributing factors to incidents\n\nUse of powerful automated attack tools\nExploitation of unpatched or unprotected software vulnerabilities\nExploitation of misconfigured operating systems, applications or network devices\nAttractiveness of your organisation to attack\nInadequate staff training\nSophisticated attacker skill which defeated counter-measures in place\nLack of security technologies\nPoor security culture in organisation\nRemote accessibility and/or connectivity of your network to the internet\nInadequate levels of security on 3rd party computers (e.g. home, internet cafes)\nExploitation of default operating system configurations\nLack of control and knowledge of network changes\nNone of the above\n\n0% 3% 6% 9% 12% 15%\n\n\n-----\n\n### Expenditure on IT security\n\nWhen asked if their organisation had increased expenditure on IT security in the previous 12 months:\n\n� 52% of respondents reported ‘yes’\n\n� 42% of respondents reported ‘no’, and\n\n� 6% of respondents reported they ‘did not know’.\n\nFigure_13 – \u0007organisations that increased expenditure on IT security\n\nin the previous 12 months\n\nYes\nNo\nDo not know\n\n\n### 52% of organisations increased expenditure on IT security in the previous 12 months\n\n\n-----\n\n### There is a need for continual investment in information security\n\n\nThese findings indicate that more than half of participating organisations are increasing their expenditure in\n\ninformation security.

The more recent trend, however, is for DDoS to be used for extortion.\n\nEarly in 2012, CERT Australia received reports from a range of Australian financial companies that were being\n\ntargeted by extortion-based DDoS attacks. They had been called and threatened with an attack against their\n\nwebsite, unless they made a payment.\n\nThis type of attack can cause serious problems. It can not only disrupt the company’s online activities via its\n\nwebsite, it can also stop clients from doing business with them online.\n\nThe attackers chose their targets carefully. They combed victim websites for pages that would generate the\n\nmost processing in order to increase the likelihood of successfully taking down the site. Some websites were\n\nbrought down by the attack; others had the infrastructure to withstand it.\n\nThe CERT located the target list for the attacks and contacted the listed companies. As the attacks were of\n\na criminal nature, the CERT also provided all relevant information to the Australian Federal Police’s High Tech\n\nCrime Operations for investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sites which had the ability to mitigate the attack were not targeted for long. With the attacks being\n\nfinancially motivated, the attacker seemed quick to move on to other potential victims. However, if the\n\ncompany communicated with the attacker, the site appeared on the target list for longer periods of time.\n\nThe CERT was able to identify the international source of the attacks from a sample of the DDoS traffic\n\nprovided by one of the companies – this highlights the value of sharing information. The CERT then notified\n\nits international counterpart, asking for assistance in having the control hub taken down. The international\n\nCERT responded quickly and the host was shut down.\n\nHowever, as is normally the case with such incidents, the control hub then moved to another internet address and\n\nrecommenced attacks. The CERT again contacted overseas counterparts to issue further take down requests.\n\nThe CERT also continued to follow up with affected companies, providing options and advice on mitigation\n\ntechniques for possible future attacks. The companies that were most effective in mitigating the attacks had\n\nalready well-established and tested response procedures in place for dealing with DDoS.\n\nThis case study highlights the need for organisations to develop DDoS response plans and test them. By\n\npartnering with the CERT – ideally before an incident occurs – business can be better prepared to mitigate\n\ncyber attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## reporting of incidents_\n\n\n### It’s important and necessary for business to report cyber incidents to CERT Australia... all information is held in the strictest confidence\n\n\nRespondents who indicated their organisation had experienced cyber attacks in the previous 12 months,\n\nwere asked a range of questions about reporting the incidents.\n\nJust under half the respondents (44%) said they had chosen not to report the incidents to an outside\n\norganisation. Of the respondents who did report one or more incidents, 44% were to a law enforcement\n\nagency, and 29% were to the CERT.\n\nFigure_15 – to whom organisations reported a cyber security incident\n\nChose not to report the incident/s to anyone outside the organisation\n\nReported one or more incidents to a law enforcement agency\n\nReported one or more incidents to CERT Australia\n\nReported one or more incidents to legal counsel to seek civil remedy\n\n\n-----\n\nThese findings indicate a high level of caution from organisations in reporting incidents – although they may\n\nalso reflect the actions of the respondent, rather than the overall practice of the organisation.\n\nWhen asked why they had chosen not to report a cyber security incident to a law enforcement agency, 74%\n\nindicated that they didn’t think the incident/s warranted law enforcement intervention. This response may\n\nindicate the incident/s suffered by these organisations were of a minor level and/or they were unaware of the\n\nthreshold level for interest and acceptance for investigation by a law enforcement agency. In addition, 35% of\n\norganisations didn’t believe law enforcement had the capability to effectively conduct an investigation into the\n\nincident, while 26% didn’t think the perpetrator would get caught.\n\nFigure_16 – \u0007why organisations chose not to report a cyber security incident\n\nto a law enforcement agency\n\nNegative publicity would hurt your organisation if/when\nthe news of the incident/s became public\n\nYour organisation was unaware law enforcement\nwere interested in such incidents\n\nYour organisation did not think the perpetrators would be caught\n\nYour organisation didn’t believe law enforcement had\nthe capability to effectively investigate the incident\n\nDid not think the incident/s was serious\nenough to involve law enforcement\n\nCivil remedy seemed the best course of action\n\n\n-----\n\n### ...the benefits of reporting cyber security incidents to CERT Australia and to law enforcement...\n\n\nOut of those respondents who did report a cyber security incident to law enforcement, 33% stated that it\n\nwas their understanding the incident was not investigated and 29% stated they did not know the outcome\n\nfrom the referral, while 8% of matters referred to law enforcement were reported to have resulted in a\n\nperson being charged.\n\nFigure_17 – \u0007outcomes of reporting of a cyber security incident’s\n\nto law enforcement\n\nIncident allegation was not investigated\n\nDon't know\n\nIncident allegation was investigated but no one was charged\ndue to international jurisdictional difficulties\n\nOther\n\nIncident allegation was investigated and persons\nwere charged with an offence\n\nIncident allegation was investigated but no one\nwas charged due to insufficient evidence\n\nThese findings highlight that the CERT needs to articulate to business the benefits of reporting cyber security\n\nincidents to CERT Australia and to law enforcement, and that all information provided to the CERT is held in\n\nthe strictest confidence.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Case Study – Criminal Investigation\n\nIn 2009, the Australian Federal Police received information regarding the unauthorised modification of data at\n\na Western Australian government department. The subsequent investigation revealed two males who were\n\ncontractors to the department, sharing information regarding the illegal access to the departmental computer\n\noperating system.\n\nThe investigation revealed communications between the two males pertaining to the creation of malicious\n\nsoftware and subsequent commands to hack network security controls in an attempt to crack a file and reveal\n\nthe user-names and passwords of departmental staff.\n\nThe AFP executed search warrants at both males’ addresses and seized a number of computers and\n\nassociated media. Both males were subsequently charged with conspiracy to cause an unauthorised\n\nmodification of data held in a computer, knowing the modification to be unauthorised, and being reckless\n\nas to whether the modification impaired the reliability, security or operation, of any such data and the\n\nmodification is caused by means of a carriage service, contrary to section 11.5(1) and sub-section 477.2(1)\n\nof the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).\n\nUpon appearing at Court, both males pleaded not-guilty to the above offence. Following a trial, they were\n\nboth found guilty. One of the offenders was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment to be released after\n\nhaving served 10 months and the other to 36 months to be released after having served 12 months, both to\n\nenter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of 20 and 24 months respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n## About CERT Australia_\n\n\n### The CERT encourages business to be prepared before an incident occurs\n\n\nAs Australia’s national computer emergency response team, the CERT works to ensure that all Australians\n\nand Australian businesses have access to information on how to better protect their information technology\n\nenvironment from cyber based threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe CERT is the initial point of contact for cyber security incidents impacting on Australian networks.\n\nThe CERT is keen to highlight and reinforce the importance of business taking cyber security seriously. This\n\nnot only means being aware of cyber threats but also putting effective controls and safeguards into practice.\n\nIn Australia, it’s now publicly acknowledged that cyber operations are one of the most rapidly evolving threats\n\nto our national security.\n\nThe CERT encourages business to be prepared before an incident occurs. This involves a business knowing\n\nits network, understanding the value of its information, and understanding how both are protected.\n\nAs general guidance, the CERT advises business to use the Top 35 strategies for mitigating cyber intrusions,\n\nreleased by the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD). This list is informed by DSD’s experience in operational\n\ncyber security, including responding to serious cyber incidents and performing vulnerability assessments\n\nand penetration testing for Australian Government agencies. While the first four strategies have the potential\n\nto mitigate up to 85% of attacks, this information does need to be tailored to suit the needs and operating\n\nenvironment of each business.\n\nThe CERT also encourages business to understand what constitutes normal behaviour on its network. By\n\nknowing this, the business is more likely to detect unusual behaviour.\n\n\n-----\n\nBeing prepared before an incident occurs also involves having operational relationships in place with those\n\nwho can assist, such as the CERT and law enforcement agencies. Having such contacts already established\n\nhelps with the efficient and effective sharing of information for prevention – and if necessary, mitigation.\n\nReporting incidents to the CERT is necessary and important. It allows the CERT to make sure that businesses\n\nreceive the right help – and all information provided to the CERT is held in the strictest confidence.\n\nThe CERT is the entry point into government for Australian businesses. It works in the Cyber Security\n\nOperations Centre, sharing information with other key agencies including the Australian Security Intelligence\n\nOrganisation, the Australian Federal Police and the Defence Signals Directorate. The CERT also works closely\n\nand shares information with its international counterparts.\n\nThis means the CERT is very well connected and very well informed, which is a great asset in helping\n\nbusinesses protect themselves from cyber attacks. The CERT is also a strong point of referral, which can lead\n\nto some very positive outcomes in terms of resolution and prosecution.\n\nAs such, the important messages for businesses are to:\n\n� continue taking cyber security seriously by implementing effective controls\n\n� partner with the CERT before an incident occurs, and\n\n� report cyber incidents to the CERT.\n\nTo report an incident\n\n� call the CERT Australia hotline on 1300 172 499, or\n\n� email info@cert.gov.au\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",
