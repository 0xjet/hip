Importantly, this incident\ndid not affect our patient care delivery operations, overall campus network, or COVID-19\nwork.\n\nWhile we stopped the attack as it was occurring, the actors launched malware that encrypted\na limited number of servers within the School of Medicine, making them temporarily\ninaccessible. Since that time, we have been working with a leading cyber-security consultant\nand other outside experts to investigate the incident and reinforce our IT systems’ defenses.\nWe expect to fully restore the affected servers soon.\n\nOur investigation is ongoing but, at this time, we believe that the malware encrypted our\nservers opportunistically, with no particular area being targeted. The attackers obtained\nsome data as proof of their action, to use in their demand for a ransom payment. We are\ncontinuing our investigation, but we do not currently believe patient medical records were\nexposed. As additional facts become known, we will provide further updates.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data that was encrypted is important to some of the academic work we pursue as a\nuniversity serving the public good. We therefore made the difficult decision to pay some\nportion of the ransom, approximately $1.14 million, to the individuals behind the malware\nattack in exchange for a tool to unlock the encrypted data and the return of the data they\nobtained.\n\nThis incident reflects the growing use of malware by cyber-criminals around the world\nseeking monetary gain, including several recent attacks on institutions of higher education.\nWe continue to cooperate with law enforcement, and we appreciate everyone’s\nunderstanding that we are limited in what we can share while we continue with our\ninvestigation.\n\n\n-----",
