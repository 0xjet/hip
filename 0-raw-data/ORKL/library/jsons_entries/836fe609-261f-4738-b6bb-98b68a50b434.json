The actor, previously identified by\nSymantec as Tortoiseshell, deployed a website called hxxp://hiremilitaryheroes[.]com that\nposed as a website to help U.S. military veterans find jobs. The URL is strikingly close to that\n[of legitimate websites, such as www.hiringourheroes.org. The site prompted users to](https://www.hiringourheroes.org/)\ndownload an app, which was actually a malware downloader, deploying malicious spying\ntools and other malware.\n\nThis is just the latest actions by Tortoiseshell. Previous research showed that the actor was\nbehind an attacker on an IT provider in Saudi Arabia. For this campaign Talos tracked,\nTortoiseshell used the same backdoor that it has in the past, showing that they are relying on\nsome of the same tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).\n\n## Fake veteran hiring website\n\nThe fake website, called \"Hire Military Heroes\" (hxxp://hiremilitaryheroes[.]com/), which\nimmediately goes after veterans with an image from the movie \"Flags of our Fathers.\"\n\nThe website is only composed of three links to download a desktop app for free. The app is a\nfake installer. Contrary to standard malware installers, this one does not need to be silent, as\nthe user expects an installation. Here's a look at the user interface, and the error message is\nalways displayed to suggest something has \"stopped\" the app from accessing its database.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe progress bar almost fills up entirely, and then displays an error message:\n\nThe installer checks if Google is reachable. If not, the installation stops. If it is reachable, the\ninstaller downloads two binaries from hxxp://199[.]187[.]208[.]75/MyWS.asmx/GetUpdate?\nval=UID:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded binaries are stored in base64. One of the binaries is a tool used to perform\na reconnaissance stage on the system and the second is the Remote Administrative Tool.\nThe RAT is executed as a service. The installer installs the service first (for the -install\nargument) and then stops/starts the service with the command and control (C2) server IP in\nargument:\n\n\n-----\n\nIf something fails during the installation, an email is sent to the attacker. The credentials are\nhardcoded in the installer. The email account is ericaclayton2020@gmail[.]com and the error\nemail is sent to marinaparks108@gmail[.]com.\n\n## Reconnaissance phase\n\nThe downloaded reconnaissance tool is named \"bird.exe\" on the system and the internal\n[name is Liderc. Liderc is a unique supernatural being of Hungarian folklore. The original form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lid%C3%A9rc)\nof this creature is a chicken, that would explain the name of the dropped PE on the system,\n\"Bird.exe.\"\n\nThe purpose is to collect a lot of information on the victim machine:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker retrieves information such as the date, time and drivers. The attacker can then\nsee information on the system, the patch level, the number of processors, the network\nconfiguration, the hardware, firmware versions, the domain controller, the name of the admin,\nthe list of the account, etc. This is a significant amount of information relating to a machine\nand makes the attacker well-prepared to carry out additional attacks. The attacker even gets\nthe size of the screen by using WMI, which is potentially a trick to identify if the system is a\nsandbox.\n\nAll this information is sent by email by using the same emails:\n\n## Remote access tool\n\nThis actor also deploys a RAT named \"IvizTech\" on the system. The code and features are\nsimilar to the ones outlined by Symantec. The IP is put in argument to the service. The\nattackers hoped that this would make it impossible to get to the C2, as the installer is needed\n— you can't just get there with the RAT itself. This allows an attacker to have a malware that\n\n\n-----\n\nthey can add modules onto (no need to recompile when you want to update the C2).\nRequiring the installer also could make it more complicated for researchers to access the C2\nand get hands-on analysis of the malware.\n\nThe malware has four features:\n\nkill_me: It stops the service and removes the malware\nUpload: It downloads a file on the internet\nUnzip: It uses PowerShell to unzip and execute code on the system\nAnd finally, the malware can execute a command\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis new campaign utilizing the malicious hiring website represents a massive shift for\nTortiseshell. This particular attack vector has the potential to allow a large swath of people to\nbecome victims of this attack. Americans are quick to give back and support the veteran\npopulation. Therefore, it's this website has a high chance of gaining traction on social media\nwhere users could share the link in the hopes of supporting veterans.\n\nAt the time of publication, we do not have a method of distribution used, nor do we have\nproof of this existing in the wild. The level of sophistication is low as the .NET binary used\nhas poor OPSEC capabilities, such as hard-coded credentials, but then other more\nadvanced techniques by making the malware modular and aware that the victim already ran\nit. There is a possibility that multiple teams from an APT worked on multiple elements of this\nmalware, as we can see certain levels of sophistication existing and various levels of\nvictimology.\n\n## Coverage\n\n[Intrusion prevention systems such as SNORT® provide an effective tool to detect](https://snort.org/)\nTortoiseshell activity due to specific signatures present at the end of each command. In\naddition to intrusion prevention systems, it is advisable to employ endpoint detection and\n[response tools (EDR) such as Cisco AMP for Endpoints, which gives users the ability to](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\ntrack process invocation and inspect processes.
