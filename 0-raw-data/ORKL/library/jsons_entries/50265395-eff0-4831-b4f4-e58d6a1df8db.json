High-profile cyber activity publicly attributed to Russian state-sponsored APT actors\nby U.S. government reporting and legal actions includes:\n\n     - **Russian state-sponsored APT actors targeting state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)**\n**governments and aviation networks, September 2020, through at least December 2020.**\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors targeted dozens of SLTT government and aviation\nnetworks. The actors successfully compromised networks and exfiltrated data from multiple\nvictims.\n\n     - **Russian state-sponsored APT actors’** **global Energy Sector intrusion campaign, 2011 to**\n**2018. These Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a multi-stage intrusion campaign**\nin which they gained remote access to U.S. and international Energy Sector networks,\ndeployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related data.\n\n     - **Russian state-sponsored APT actors’** **campaign against Ukrainian critical**\n**infrastructure, 2015 and 2016. Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a**\ncyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution companies, leading to multiple companies\n[experiencing unplanned power outages in December 2015. The actors deployed BlackEnergy](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/software/S0089)\nmalware to steal user credentials and used its destructive malware component, KillDisk, to\nmake infected computers inoperable. In 2016, these actors conducted a cyber-intrusion\n[campaign against a Ukrainian electrical transmission company and deployed CrashOverride](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/software/S0604)\nmalware specifically designed to attack power grids.\n\nFor more information on recent and historical Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see\n[the referenced products below or cisa.gov/Russia.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/russia)\n\n     - [Joint FBI-DHS-CISA CSA Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Cyber Operations:](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-116a)\n[Trends and Best Practices for Network Defenders](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-116a)\n\n     - [Joint NSA-FBI-CISA CSA Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to](https://media.defense.gov/2021/jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF)\n[Compromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments](https://media.defense.gov/2021/jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF)\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\n     - [Joint FBI-CISA CSA Russian State-Sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat Actor](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a)\n[Compromises U.S. Government Targets](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a)\n\n     - [Joint CISA-FBI CSA APT Actors Chaining Vulnerabilities against SLTT, Critical Infrastructure,](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-283a)\n[and Elections Organizations](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-283a)\n\n     - [CISA’s webpage Remediating Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-apt-compromised-networks)\n[Directory/M365 Compromise](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-apt-compromised-networks)\n\n     - [CISA Alert Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy Sector](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A) and Other Critical\n[Infrastructure Sectors](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\n\n     - CISA ICS: Alert Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure\n\nTable 1 provides common, publicly known TTPs employed by Russian state-sponsored APT actors,\nwhich map to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 10.

Without a centralized log collection and**\nmonitoring capability, organizations have limited ability to investigate incidents or detect the\nthreat actor behavior described in this advisory. Depending on the environment, examples\ninclude:\n```\n        o Native tools such as M365’s Sentinel. \n        o Third-party tools, such as Sparrow, Hawk, or CrowdStrike's Azure Reporting Tool\n\n```\n(CRT), to review Microsoft cloud environments and to detect unusual activity, service\nprincipals, and application activity. Note: for guidance on using these and other\n[detection tools, refer to CISA Alert Detecting Post-Compromise Threat Activity in](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\n[Microsoft Cloud Environments.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\n\n    - **Look for behavioral evidence or network and host-based artifacts from known Russian**\nstate-sponsored TTPs. See table 1 for commonly observed TTPs.\n```\n        o To detect password spray activity, review authentication logs for system and\n\n```\napplication login failures of valid accounts. Look for multiple, failed authentication\nattempts across multiple accounts.\n```\n        o To detect use of compromised credentials in combination with a VPS, follow the below\n\n```\nsteps:\n\n            - Look for suspicious “impossible logins,” such as logins with changing\nusername, user agent strings, and IP address combinations or logins where IP\naddresses do not align to the expected user’s geographic location.\n\n            - Look for one IP used for multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.\n\n            - Look for “impossible travel.” Impossible travel occurs when a user logs in from\nmultiple IP addresses that are a significant geographic distance apart (i.e., a\nperson could not realistically travel between the geographic locations of the two\nIP addresses during the time period between the logins). Note: implementing\nthis detection opportunity can result in false positives if legitimate users apply\nVPN solutions before connecting into networks.\n\n            - Look for processes and program execution command-line arguments that may\nindicate credential dumping, especially attempts to access or copy the\n```\n            ntds.dit file from a domain controller. \n\n```\n            - Look for suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or\napplying user account mitigations.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\n            - Look for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.\n\n            - Look for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated\nwith normal user activity, which may indicate bot activity.\n\n     - For organizations with OT/ICS systems:\n```\n        o Take note of unexpected equipment behavior; for example, unexpected reboots of\n\n```\ndigital controllers and other OT hardware and software.\n```\n        o Record delays or disruptions in communication with field equipment or other OT\n\n```\ndevices. Determine if system parts or components are lagging or unresponsive.\n\n## INCIDENT RESPONSE \n\nOrganizations detecting potential APT activity in their IT or OT networks should:\n\n1. Immediately isolate affected systems.\n\n2. Secure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup\ndata with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.\n\n3. Collect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.\n\n4. Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter\nexpertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that\ncould enable follow-on exploitation.\n\n[5. Report incidents to CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/report) [and/or the FBI via your local FBI field office](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field) or the FBI’s 24/7\n\n[CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.](mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov)\n\n**Note: for OT assets, organizations should have a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if**\nyou lose access to—or control of—the IT and/or OT environment.

Assign main points of contact for a suspected incident as well\nas roles and responsibilities and ensure personnel know how and when to report an incident.\n\n     - Minimize gaps in IT/OT security personnel availability by identifying surge support for\n[responding to an incident. Malicious cyber actors are known to target organizations on](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-243a)\n[weekends and holidays](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-243a) when there are gaps in organizational cybersecurity—critical\ninfrastructure organizations should proactively protect themselves by minimizing gaps in\ncoverage.\n\n     - Ensure IT/OT security personnel monitor key internal security capabilities and can identify\nanomalous behavior. Flag any identified IOCs and TTPs for immediate response. (See table 1\nfor commonly observed TTPs).\n\n#### Create, Maintain, and Exercise a Cyber Incident Response, Resilience Plan, and Continuity of Operations Plan\n\n     - Create, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations plan.\n\n     - Ensure personnel are familiar with the key steps they need to take during an incident and are\npositioned to act in a calm and unified manner. Key questions:\n```\n        o Do personnel have the access they need? \n        o Do they know the processes? \n\n```\n     - For OT assets/networks,\n```\n        o Identify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to—or\n\n```\ncontrol of—the IT and/or OT environment.\n\n            - Identify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or\nmanual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated if the connections\ncreate risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test\ncontingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety critical functions can\nbe maintained during a cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate\nat necessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.\n```\n        o Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or\n\n```\nOT networks need to be taken offline.\n```\n        o Implement data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks. Backup\n\n```\nprocedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis. Regularly test backup\nprocedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could\nenable the spread of malware.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n```\n        o In addition to backing up data, develop recovery documents that include configuration\n\n```\nsettings for common devices and critical OT equipment. This can enable more efficient\nrecovery following an incident.\n\n### Enhance your Organization’s Cyber Posture\n\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend organizations apply the best practices below for identity and\naccess management, protective controls and architecture, and vulnerability and configuration\nmanagement.\n\n#### Identity and Access Management\n\n     - Require multi-factor authentication for all users, without exception.\n\n     - Require accounts to have strong passwords and do not allow passwords to be used across\nmultiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have access.\n\n     - Secure credentials. Russian state-sponsored APT actors have demonstrated their ability to\nmaintain persistence using compromised credentials.\n```\n        o Use virtualizing solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials are\n\n```\nsecurely stored.\n```\n        o Disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory.\n        o Consider disabling or limiting New Technology Local Area Network Manager\n\n```\n(NTLM) and WDigest Authentication.\n`o Implement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (Refer to` [Microsoft:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage)\n\n[Manage Windows Defender Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage) for more information). For Windows\nServer 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).\n```\n        o Minimize the Active Directory attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting activity.\n\n```\nMalicious activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ TGS and can\nbe used to obtain hashed credentials that attackers attempt to crack.\n\n     - Set a [strong](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002) password policy for service accounts.\n\n     - Audit Domain Controllers to log successful Kerberos TGS requests and ensure the events are\nmonitored for anomalous activity.\n```\n        o Secure accounts.\n        o Enforce the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the\n\n```\nminimum permission they need to do their tasks.\n```\n        o Ensure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of\n\n```\nadministrative tasks.\n```\n        o Create non-privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the non\n```\nprivileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email access).\n\n#### Protective Controls and Architecture \n\n     - Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate lateral movement by a\nthreat actor or malware. Use network monitoring tools and host-based logs and monitoring\ntools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools are particularly\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\nuseful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon\nnetwork connections for each host.\n\n     - Enable strong spam filters.\n```\n        o Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users. \n        o Filter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching end users.\n        o Implement a user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious\n\n```\nwebsites or opening malicious attachments.\n\n**Note: CISA, the FBI, and NSA also recommend, as a longer-term effort, that critical infrastructure**\norganizations implement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and\nfunctionality. Network segmentation can help prevent lateral movement by controlling traffic flows\nbetween—and access to—various subnetworks.\n\n     - Appropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network\nsegmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network\nis compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated communication\nbetween the IT and OT networks.\n\n     - Organize OT assets into logical zones by taking into account criticality, consequence, and\noperational necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones and\ndeploy security controls to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones.\nProhibit ICS protocols from traversing the IT network.\n\n#### Vulnerability and Configuration Management\n\n     - Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network\nassets, in a timely manner. Prioritize patching [known exploited vulnerabilities, especially those](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\nCVEs identified in this CSA, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote\ncode execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment.\n```\n        o Consider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a risk\n```\nbased assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones that should\nparticipate in the patch management program.\n```\n        o Consider signing up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability\n\n```\nscanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service\nevaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP\naddresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.\n\n     - Use industry recommended antivirus programs.\n```\n        o Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets\n\n```\nusing up-to-date signatures.\n```\n        o Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are\n\n```\nidentified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\n\n     - Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and\nmitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security\nweaknesses.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** CISA | FBI | NSA\n\n     - Disable all unnecessary ports and protocols\n```\n        o Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary\n\n```\nports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control\nactivity.\n```\n        o Turn off or disable any unnecessary services (e.g., PowerShell) or functionality within\n\n```\ndevices.\n\n     - Ensure OT hardware is in read-only mode.\n\n### Increase Organizational Vigilance\n\n     - [Regularly review reporting on this threat.
