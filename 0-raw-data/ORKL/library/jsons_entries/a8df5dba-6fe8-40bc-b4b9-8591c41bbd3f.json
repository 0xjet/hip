The malware\nhas functionality that enables it to download/upload/execute files, steal credentials from Chrome/Firefox browsers, and perform file\nmanagement, among other things.\n\nBy: Matthew Stewart June 09, 2020 Read time: ( words)\n\n[We recently noticed a Twitter post by MalwareHunterTeam that showed a Java downloader with a low detection rate. Its name,](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1255840193745215489)\n“Company PLP_Tax relief due to Covid-19 outbreak CI+PL.jar”, suggests it may have been used in a Covid-19-themed phishing\ncampaign. Running this file led to the download of a new, undetected malware sample written in Node.js; this trojan is dubbed as\n“QNodeService”.\n\nThe use of Node.js is an unusual choice for malware authors writing commodity malware, as it is primarily designed for web server\ndevelopment, and would not be pre-installed on machines likely to be targeted. However, the use of an uncommon platform may have\nhelped evade detection by antivirus software.\n\nThe malware has functionality that enables it to download/upload/execute files, steal credentials from Chrome/Firefox browsers, and\nperform file management, among other things. It targets Windows systems, but its design and certain pieces of code suggest crossplatform compatibility may be a future goal.\n\nThe infection begins with a Java downloader which, in addition to downloading Node.js, downloads the following files: “wizard.js”, and\n“qnodejs-win32-ia32.js” or “qnodejs-win32-x64.js”. We analyzed these components to learn more about their behavior.\n\n## Analysis of Java Downloader\n\nThe sample mentioned above, “Company PLP_Tax relief due to Covid-19 outbreak CI+PL.jar”, serving as the Java downloader, has been\nobfuscated with the Allatori obfuscator. Allatori adds junk code and obfuscates strings to make analysis more difficult. We deobfuscated\nthe code to be able to start the analysis.\n\nDecompiled code of the sample (obfuscated with Allatori obfuscator) Figure 1. Decompiled code of the sample (obfuscated with Allatori\nobfuscator)\n\nDeobfuscated code of the sample Figure 2. Deobfuscated code of the sample\nIt downloads Node.js to the User Profile directory. It checks the system architecture and downloads the 32-bit or 64-bit version\nappropriately.\n\node snippet for downloading Node.js to the user directory Figure 3. Code snippet for downloading Node.js to the user directory\nIt also downloads a file named “wizard.js” from the URL hxxps://central.qhub.qua.one/scripts/wizard.js. It then runs this file using Node.js\n[with multiple command line arguments, including the URL of the C&C server:](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/command-and-control-server)\n\nwizard.js being run by Node.js Figure 4. wizard.js being run by Node.js\nNote that “–group user:476@qhub-subscription[…]” is a parameter used during communication with the C&C server; the presence of a\nuser identifier and mention of a “subscription” suggest that this malware may be sold as a subscription service.\n\n## Analysis of wizard.js\n\nThe wizard.js file is an obfuscated Javascript (Node.js) file. It is responsible for persistence (by creating a “Run” registry key entry) and\nfor downloading another payload depending on the system architecture.\n\nIt creates a file named “qnodejs-<8 digit hex number>.cmd” which contains the arguments used to launch the file. This is invoked by the\nregistry key entry it creates at “HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run”. It also checks whether it’s running on a\nWindows platform, suggesting the authors may have cross-platform compatibility in mind.\n\nFigure 5. wizard.js checks if it’s running on windows, and installs the Run registry key entry if so Figure 5. wizard.js checks if it’s\nrunning on windows, and installs the Run registry key entry if so\n\nFigure 6. The registry “Run” key entry added by wizard.js Figure 6. The registry “Run” key entry added by wizard.js\nIt downloads a file from hxxps://central.qhub.qua.one/scripts/qnodejs-<platform>-<arch>.js. Based on possible values for\nprocess.platform and process.arch in Node.js, we found files qnodejs-win32-ia32.js and qnodejs-win32-x64.js hosted on the server. The\nserver also contains SHA1 hashes for each sample, although they are named .sha256. These hashes are downloaded and checked by\nthe downloaded sample when it runs.\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing process.platform and process.arch to determine the payload to download Figure 7. Using process.platform and process.arch to\ndetermine the payload to download\n\n## Analysis of qnodejs-win32-<architecture>.js\n\nA file named qnodejs-win32-ia32.js or qnodejs-win32-x64.js is downloaded based on the system architecture (whether the OS is 64-bit or\n32-bit).\n\nThe files contain an embedded “node_modules” folder with libraries for Node.js, which is extracted upon execution. Unlike the Javascript\ncode itself, these libraries are architecture-specific, which is the reason separate files are distributed based on system architecture.\nScreenshots below are based on the “win32-ia32” variant from 2020-04-30.\n\nWe named this malware “QNodeService,” since this seems to be the name used internally, as indicated by the code that validates\ncommand line arguments.\n\n“QNodeService” used internally in the code Figure 8. The name “QNodeService” used internally in the code\nThe malware is divided into modules. Access to these modules is obfuscated with the use of a lookup function named “v”. Some modules\nconsist solely of a “require” call to import libraries, while others are custom modules written by the author.\n\nModules used by the malware Figure 9. Modules used by the malware\nModules are referenced by index with lookup function “v” Figure 10. Modules are referenced by index with lookup function “v”\nCertain modules in this file are identical to wizard.js; in particular, these reuse the code that determines the URL for the sample and its\nhash. In this file, the module is used to download and verify the SHA1 hash. If the hash fails, the malware terminates.\n\nThe malware uses the socket.io library for communication with the C&C server. As a result, it is designed with a reactive programming\nparadigm, and uses WebSocket to communicate with the server.\n\nWebSocket handshake Figure 11. WebSocket handshake\nThe malware can steal passwords from Chrome and Firefox.\n\nCode snippets for stealing passwords from Chrome Figure 12. Code snippets for stealing passwords from Chrome\nCode snippets for stealing passwords from Firefox Figure 13. Code snippets for stealing passwords from Firefox\nBelow is a list of commands accepted by the malware:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\ncontrol/reload Signals wizard.js to redownload the main payload.\n\ncontrol/uninstall Signals wizard.js to remove the Run key entry from the system and terminate.\n\ninfo/get-ip-address Gets IP address, location, hostname, etc.\n\ninfo/get-label Returns label set by the “set-label” command\n\ninfo/get-machine-uuid Gets a UUID generated by the malware.\n\ninfo/get-os-name Gets the platform (windows) and architecture (x32/x64) of the system.\n\ninfo/get-user-home Gets the user profile directory (os.homedir())\n\ninfo/set-label Sets label\n\nfile-manager/absolute Gets the full path of a file\n\nfile-manager/execute Executes a file with the command ‘start “” /B <file>’\n\nfile-manager/delete Removes a file or files on the system (accepts globs, using “rimraf” library)\n\nfile-manager/forward-access Generates URL and token to use for the “http-forward” command (see below)\n\nfile-manager/list Lists files in specific directories\n\nfile-manager/mkdirs Creates a directory on the system\n\nfile-manager/write Writes a file sent from the C&C SERVER onto the system\n\nhttp-forward HTTP requests sent to a specific URL at the C&C are routed to the infected machine (see below)\n\npassword-recovery/applications Lists applications for which passwords can be read (Chrome & Firefox)\n\npassword-recovery/recover Recovers passwords from a specific application (Chrome or Firefox)\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 5th, the malware was updated with three additional commands:\n\ninfo/get-tags Returns list of tags set by “add-tag” command\n\ninfo/add-tag Adds tags\n\ninfo/remove-tag Removes tags\n\nOf particular note is the http-forward command, which allows an attacker to download a file without directly connecting to the victim\nmachine, as shown below in figures 13-16. However, a valid request path and access token are required to access files on the machine.\nThe C&C server must first send “file-manager/forward-access” to generate the URL and access token to use for the http-forward\ncommand later\n.\n\nC&C server sends “file-manager/forward-access” command over WebSocket Figure 14. C&C server sends “file-manager/forwardaccess” command over WebSocket\n\nThe malware responds with the access token and URL Figure 15. The malware responds with the access token and URL that are used\nin the cURL request in Figure 16\nThe malware responds with the forwarding URL and access token. Then, a third party who has been given the URL and access token\ncould send an HTTP request to the C&C server to retrieve files from the victim machine without directly connecting to it.\n\nAn HTTP cURL request to the C&C Figure 16. An HTTP cURL request to the C&C server requesting “C:\\foo.txt” (with contents “bar”)\nThe C&C server forwards the HTTP request to the malware on the victim machine using the http-forward command. If the access token\nis correct, the malware sends the file’s contents back to the C&C server, which in turn sends the contents back to the attacker in its HTTP\nresponse, enabling remote download.\n\nC&C server forwards the cURL request to the malware on the victim machine Figure 17. C&C server forwards the cURL request to the\nmalware on the victim machine with the “http-forward” command\nSimilar to wizard.js, the authors seem to have cross-platform compatibility in mind. Although this sample is the win32-ia32 variant, it\ncontains code that would improve compatibility on Darwin (MacOS) and Linux platforms.\n\nCode snippet showing cross-platform compatibility Figure 18. Code snippet showing cross-platform compatibility\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThreat actors constantly come up with ingenious ways to create malware and ensure that it affects as many systems for as long as it can,\nsuch as using environments that are less utilized for malware creation, maintaining persistence, and giving them cross-platform\ncompatibility.
