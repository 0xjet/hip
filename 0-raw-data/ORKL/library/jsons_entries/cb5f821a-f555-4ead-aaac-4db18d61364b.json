Schwartz (euroinfosec) • November 12, 2020](https://www.twitter.com/euroinfosec)\n\nAdvertisement by Darkside operators on a cybercrime forum (Source: Kela)\nDarkside is the latest ransomware gang to announce that it's launched an affiliate program\nas part of its bid to maximize revenue.\n\n**See Also:** [Ransomware Demystified: What Security Analysts Need to Know](https://www.databreachtoday.com/whitepapers/ransomware-demystified-what-security-analysts-need-to-know-w-10021)\n\nIn recent days, the operators behind Darkside have taken to XSS and Exploit - two major,\nRussian-language cybercrime forums - to announce the details of the gang's new affiliate\n[program, Israeli cyberthreat intelligence monitoring firm Kela reports.](https://ke-la.com/)\n\n\"The share paid to affiliates is 75% to 90%, depending on the size of the ransom.\" —\nKela\n\nHere's how such affiliate programs work: Ransomware operators provide crypto-locking\nmalware code to third parties. Each affiliate receives a version of code with their unique ID\nembedded. For every victim that pays a ransom, the affiliate shares the take with the\nransomware operator.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Darkside ransom note (Source: Bleeping Computer)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/)\nFor example, the affiliate program run by Sodinokibi - aka REvil - as of last year was giving\n30% of every ransom payment to an affiliate, rising to 40% after three successful ransom\n[payments (see: Sodinokibi Ransomware Gang Appears to Be Making a Killing).](https://www.databreachtoday.com/sodinokibi-ransomware-gang-appears-to-be-making-killing-a-13269)\n\nDarkside's terms and conditions differ. \"They stated that their average payments to their\naffiliates are about $400,000 and the share paid to affiliates is about 75-90% of every haul,\ndepending on the size of the ransom, with the ransomware operators keeping the\nremainder,\" Kela says, noting that Darkside claims the average ransom it receives is\nbetween $1.6 million and $4 million.\n\n\n-----\n\nPost by Darkside operators to a Russian-language cybercrime forum (Source and\ntranslation: Kela)\n[Ransomware affiliate programs abound. Victoria Kivilevich, a threat intelligence analyst at](https://ke-la.com/torum-is-dead-long-live-cryptbb/)\nKela, says some of the more famous [\"big game\" ransomware operators running affiliate](https://www.databreachtoday.com/operators-behind-prolocker-ransomware-seek-big-game-a-14985)\nprograms - as well as blogs for leaking stolen data - include:\n\n[Avaddon;](https://www.databreachtoday.com/avaddon-ransomware-joins-data-leaking-club-a-14809)\n[Darkside;](https://www.databreachtoday.com/ransomware-darkside-debuts-script-kiddies-tap-dharma-a-14874)\n[LockBit;](https://www.databreachtoday.com/lockbit-ransomware-uses-automation-tools-to-pick-targets-a-15236)\n[Netwalker;](https://www.databreachtoday.com/fbi-covid-19-themed-phishing-spreads-netwalker-ransomware-a-14744)\nRanzy;\n[Sodinokibi, aka REvil;](https://www.databreachtoday.com/sodinokibi-ransomware-gang-appears-to-be-making-killing-a-13269)\n[Suncrypt - now apparently retired.](https://www.databreachtoday.com/blogs/data-exfiltrating-ransomware-gangs-pedal-false-promises-p-2965)\n\nOther ransomware operations - some active, some now defunct - that have run affiliate\nprograms include Chimera, CryLock, Exorcist, Gretta, Makop, Thanos and Zeppelin, she\nsays.\n\n## Affiliate Program Upsides\n\nRunning an affiliate program offers numerous upsides. For starters, the ransomware operator\nhandles the technical side, including \"product updates.\" Once the operator has built all\nrequired infrastructure - typically including a self-service portal for victims to pay - they can,\nin theory, scale to handle as many affiliates as they want. This crowdsourcing model can give\nthem the ability to realize much greater profits, especially compared to trying to hit victims\nthemselves. Affiliates, meanwhile, don't need to build and maintain their own malware and\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Other upsides include the ability of the operation to attract specialists - in network](https://www.databreachtoday.com/eyeing-bigger-targets-ransomware-gangs-recruit-specialists-a-14968)\npenetration, for example - who can focus on amassing victims while leaving tech support and\n[customer service, so to speak, to the operator.](https://www.databreachtoday.com/blogs/ransomware-gangs-take-customer-service-approach-p-2203)\n\n## Two Main Downsides\n\nSo, what are the downsides to running an affiliate program? Kivilevich highlights two main\nproblems: reputation and infiltration.\n\nIf an affiliate does something bad, that reflects on the operator, as Darkside has noted in one\nof its posts. \"For example, when an affiliate of Suncrypt attacked hospitals, you see Suncrypt\nwriting: 'A new affiliate locked it unknowingly, and for this he was punished! Hospitals,\ngovernment, airports, etc., we do not attack,'\" she says.\n\nRelying on affiliates also means that the ransomware operation may be inadvertently\nrecruiting undercover security researchers or law enforcement agents who might potentially\n\"gather more intelligence about their activities,\" Kivilevich says.\n\n## Ransomware Features\n\nHow big a threat does Darkside pose? The operators say that the crypto-locking malware\nthat Darkside provides to affiliates can encrypt both Windows and Linux files. Researchers at\nRussian security firm Kaspersky recently determined that RansomEXX ransomware also can\n[crypto-lock Linux files (see: RansomEXX Ransomware Can Now Target Linux Systems).](https://www.databreachtoday.com/ransomexx-ransomware-now-target-linux-systems-a-15332)\n\nLike many types of malware, Darkside is designed so it cannot infect PCs that are in one of\nthe member states of the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States, which includes\nRussia and 11 other nations (see: Russia's Cybercrime Rule Reminder: Never Hack\n_Russians)._\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Press release\" from Darkside in August announcing its debut (Source:\n[MalwareHunterTeam)](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/)\nAs proof of its success to date, Darkside has deposited 20 bitcoins - worth about $315,000 with the XSS forum. Kivilevich says this is \"a common method ransomware gangs will use to\nshow that their operation generates plenty of profit.\"\n\nLike many other ransomware operations, the gang maintains a leak site, where it names and\nshames victims and can post samples of stolen data to try to force victims to pay (see: Data_Exfiltrating Ransomware Gangs Pedal False Promises)._\n\nEven so, it's not yet clear how many organizations Darkside or its affiliates might have hit.\n\n\"Darkside has been relatively quiet since the gang emerged. They've published only four\nvictims on their site, with one being removed,\" Kivilevich says. \"It's possible the gang is\nextending their efforts, meaning that we could expect to see them performing more attacks.\"\n\nIn a likely bid to boost profits, the gang has posted that it's looking for initial access brokers\nthat can give it access to U.S. businesses with annual revenue of at least $400 million.\n\n\n-----\n\nPost by Darkside operators to a Russian-language cybercrime forum (Source and\ntranslation: Kela)\n\"Darkside is aiming for big targets,\" Kivilevich says, adding that it's the first time she's seen\n\"ransomware operators offering initial access brokers the opportunity to directly trade with\nthem\" rather than attempting to rely on \"affiliates or other middlemen.\"\n\n[As always with ransomware, criminal innovation - in a nonstop drive by attackers to](https://www.databreachtoday.com/blogs/ransomware-cybercrime-public-enemy-no-1-p-2952)\nmaximize profits - appears to be paying off at victims' expense.\n\n_This piece has been updated to clarify the amount DarkSide pays to affiliates._\n\n\n-----",
