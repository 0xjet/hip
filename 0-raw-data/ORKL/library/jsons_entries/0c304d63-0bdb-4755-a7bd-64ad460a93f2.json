Wednesday, March 2, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team_\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers investigated a Computer\nEmergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) [warning of phishing activity posted to](https://www.facebook.com/UACERT/posts/312939130865352)\nFacebook on February 25, 2022 (see Figure 1). CERT-UA attributed the activity to the Minsk\n\n-----\n\nbased UNC1151 threat group. UNC1511 is [reportedly linked to the Belarusian government](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\n[and responsible for the Ghostwriter influence campaigns. As of this publication, CTU™](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/pdfs/unc1151-ghostwriter-update-report.pdf)\nresearchers have not validated this attribution assessment. CTU researchers attribute this\nactivity to the MOONSCAPE threat group.\n\n_Figure 1. CERT-UA Facebook post warning of phishing attacks. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe rudimentary phishing message coaxes the target to use a malicious phishing link. It is\npossible that the phishing messages included imagery that was not included in the Facebook\npost.\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the two domains listed in the Facebook post and identified seven\nadditional domains based on WHOIS and passive DNS data. This cluster uses the '.space'\ntop-level domain (TLD), shares a common registrant \"Apolena Zorka\", was registered via\nPublic Domain Registry Ltd., and is primarily hosted behind Cloudflare infrastructure. Each of\nthe domains aligns with a small set of common themes typical of MOONSCAPE\ninfrastructure. Themes include information portals, email validation, cloud services, or\ngovernment entities. The Apolena Zorka cluster is a mix of generic email validation and\ndomains spoofing popular Ukrainian information services (see Figure 2). This combination\nsuggests that the websites may have been created for Ukrainian targets, including those that\nprompted the CERT-UA warning.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Apolena Zorka cluster of domains used in phishing attacks against Ukrainian_\n_targets. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCTU researchers identified another set of domains with similar characteristics to the Apolena\nZorka cluster, although this cluster used the \"Radka Dominika\" registrant (see Figure 3).\nThese domains included similar themes but used Polish words for verification (weryfikacja)\nand validation (walidacja) in several generic email validation-themed domains. Another\nidentified domain (ron-mil . space) appears to spoof the legitimate domain of the Polish\nMinistry of National Defense (ron . mil . pl).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Radka Dominika cluster of domains likely used in phishing attacks against Polish-_\n_speaking targets. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nWhen ordered by creation date, the threat actors switch between domains aligned to\nUkrainian targets and domains likely aligned with Polish-speaking targets. This pattern\nillustrates a regular cadence of new domain creation (see Figure 4). This activity likely\nreflects an operational rotation involving multiple demographics they target.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. MOONSCAPE-associated domains ordered by creation date. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nMOONSCAPE creates new infrastructure but maintains a preference for specific keywords\nand reuses old infrastructure. For example, the 'verify-email . space' domain was created on\nFebruary 2 and resolves to IP address 185 . 244 . 180 . 13. This IP address also hosted 'uapassport . site', which was created on June 22, 2021. With the exception of the TLD, the 'uapassport . site' domain is identical to the 'ua-passport . space' domain created on December\n15, 2021.\n\nMOONSCAPE has conducted phishing campaigns for years, targeting military, diplomatic,\nand government personnel in Eastern European NATO countries such as Poland, Lithuania,\nand Latvia as well as countries that border Belarus such as Ukraine. The February phishing\nattacks demonstrate that the group's espionage-focused activity continues and potentially\ncontributes to intelligence collection on Ukrainian entities in support of Russia's military\ninvasion of Ukraine that commenced on February 24, 2022.\n\nTo mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use\navailable controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. The\ndomains may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before opening them in a\nbrowser.\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\nua-passport.space Domain\nname\n\nbigmir.space Domain\nname\n\n\nUsed in MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\nUsed in MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\nmirrohost.space Domain\nname\n\nmil-gov.space Domain\nname\n\nverify-email.space Domain\nname\n\nverify-mail.space Domain\nname\n\n\ncreditalsemail.space\n\n\nDomain\nname\n\n\nmeta-ua.space Domain\nname\n\ni-ua.space Domain\nname\n\n\nkontrolapoczty.space\n\nwalidacjapoczty.space\n\nweryfikacjapoczty.space\n\n\nDomain\nname\n\nDomain\nname\n\nDomain\nname\n\n\nkonto-verify.space Domain\nname\n\n\nweryfikacjakonta.space\n\nwalidacjauzytkownika.space\n\nakademiamil.space\n\n\nDomain\nname\n\nDomain\nname\n\nDomain\nname\n\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting\nUkrainian government and military personnel\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting Polishspeaking individuals\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting Polishspeaking individuals\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting Polishspeaking individuals\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting Polishspeaking individuals\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting Polishspeaking individuals\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting Polishspeaking individuals\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting Polishspeaking individuals\n\nLinked to MOONSCAPE phishing attacks targeting Polishspeaking individuals\n\n\nron-mil.space Domain\nname\n\n\n_Table 1.
