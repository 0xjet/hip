In\nmost of identified infections, indeed, the victims were users having a mail registered on naver dot com, a\nSouth Korean web platform that includes free email boxes, news, and search engine functionality.\n**Cluster25 attributed this campaign to a DPRK-nexus adversary as similarities have been identified with**\nthe operation Kitty Phishing [1]\n\n## EVENT INSIGHTS\n\nThe Word document attached to the phishing email exploits a template injection vulnerability (CVE-2017**0199) that allows the threat actors to download a new weaponized document from a remote source. Once**\nthe document is opened, a remote URL is contacted (e.g., http:// naveicoipd.\n_tech/ACMS/0lvNAK1t/accountsTemplate) to download the malicious remote template._\n\nThe downloaded template embeds a VBA (Visual Basic Application) script that is automatically\nexecuted thanks to the already reported vulnerability. This VBA code acts as downloader for the nextstage of the kill-chain using two embedded remote URLs (32-bit and 64-bit versions of the next-stage\npayload). All the embedded strings in the VBA project are obfuscated through a base64 encoding and a\n**bytes-XOR encryption using a hardcoded XOR key.**\n\nOnce the next-stage payload is downloaded, various APIs are resolved at runtime through the\n**LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress** **APIs (e.g., RtlMoveMemory, CryptBinaryToString,**\n**DispCallFunc) and the payload is decoded through the same process used for the embedded strings.**\nFinally, the decoded payload is dropped under the path %LOCALAPPDATA%\n**\\Microsoft\\TokenBroker\\RuntimeBroker.exe and executed through the DispCallFunc API (low-level**\nimplementation of the Invoke method).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe executable RuntimeBroker.exe is protected with the UPX packer and it plays the role of a dropper\nfor the late-stage implant. The RuntimeBroker.exe execution starts with two evasion checks aimed at\navoiding the execution under sandbox or virtualized environments. In particular, the first check is\nrepresented by a time-based sandbox evasion through the GetTickCount API to check for a possible\nsandbox delay-skip feature.\n\nThe second check, instead, is represented by a hardware-based evasion through the CreateFileA API\nand a direct access on the physical drive \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0 to check for known HDD Vendor ID (e.g.,\nVBOX, VMware).\n\nAfter that, the malware performs some checks for a possible antivirus process. In particular, if there is an\nactive process named v3l4sp.exe (V3 Lite Antivirus by AhnLab Inc), the malware deletes itself and\nexits immediately. Subsequently, the malware tries to access to the C:\\ProgramData\\Intel directory\nchecking for write permissions.\n\nIf the desired permissions on this sub-directory are available, the malware proceeds with an HTTP POST\nrequest to a remote URL in order to download the final payload. Once the payload is downloaded, the\nexecutable is dropped under the C:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\IntelRST.exe path and a new registry key is\ncreated to ensure persistence. The final payload (IntelRST.exe) is heavily packed through a double\nprotection with the ASProtect packing tool. This leads to a partial unpacking of the second layer of\nprotection due to a broken IAT reconstruction.\n\nDespite the packing mechanism it was possible to extract some useful information; first of all, the\nmalware contacts a remote TXT resource stored on a Dropbox cloud server (i.e.,\n_https://dl.dropboxusercontent. com/s/k288s9tu2o53v41/zs_url.txt?dl=0) to obtain the domain of the C&C_\nserver (i.e., naveicoipd. tech). Once the command and control domain is obtained, the following\ninformation about the victim system are exfiltrated through an HTTP POST request to the C&C server:\n\n**uid: the string Cjtpp17D_ combined with the username of the current logged Windows user.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**avtype: an integer specifying the infection status of the victim machine**\n\nThe value 2 is specified if the v3l4sp.exe process exists on the system (V3 Lite Antivirus by\nthe south-korean AhnLab Inc)\nThe value 3 is specified if the AYAgent.exe is present on the system (ALYac Enterprise by the\nsouth-korean ESTsecurity Corp)\nThe value 1 is specified if neither antivirus is detected.\n**majorv and minorv: integers used to specify the major and minor version of the infected Operating**\nSystem\n\nFinally, the malware waits for a possible responsefrom the C&C server that could lead to exfiltration and\nexecution of other functionalities. In this campaign all the domains are generated through a DGA (Domain\nGeneration Algorithm)and varies from payload to payload. In most of the cases, the drop-point domains\nand the C&C domains follows the naveicoip[a-z]{1}[.](online|tech) pattern and looks registered on the\n**Hostinger or Contabo platforms. In some recent cases, certain domains are also registered on the OVH**\nplatform.\n\n## RELATED CAMPAIGNS\n\nWe identified a variants of the described campaign which showed minimal changes in the kill-chain. This\none presents a different initial access vector through a Windows Help File (CHM) and a new middle**layer dropper instead of the previous template injection. More in detail, the CHM file has different built-in**\nfiles which are dropped once the file is opened.\n\nIn particular, the most relevant files are an HTML file (called 1hh.htm) and an executable (called\n**WINWORD.exe) representing the middle-layer dropper. Once the CHM file is opened, the HTML file is**\ninjected into the CHM view to execute some malicious JavaScript code that forces the creation of a\n**shortcut under C:\\ProgramData\\chmtemp\\ pointing to WINWORD.exe.**\n\nOnce the shortcut is created, the execution of this middle-layer dropper is initiated through the Click()\nmethod on the just created Object instance. Briefly, winword.exe is responsible for the decryption and\nthe execution of the real UPX-packed dropper. The middle-layer dropper performs the same checks\nalready seen in the dropper RuntimeBroker.exe belonging to the other campaign.\n\nAfter that, the dropper checks for write permissions under %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Feeds\\ and,\nin positive case, proceeds with the decryption of the real dropperdirectly from the memory through an\nhardcoded key, as evidence following:\n\n\n-----\n\nThen the file is written under %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Feeds\\ with the name FeedsBroker.exe\nand a new registry key is created to ensure the persistence on the victim system. Before the execution\nof the UPX-packed FeedsBroker.exe the path to this executable is excluded from Microsoft Defender\nthrough the following PowerShell command:\n\n_PowerShell -Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath “PATH_TO_FEEDSBROKER.EXE”_\n\nStarting from FeedsBroker.exe, the kill-chain is identical to the just analyzed chain, as described above.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nDue to the particular situation in the area, similar campaigns targeting organizations and individuals in\nSouth Korea can be expected. Such campaigns are unlikely to abate in the foreseeable future in terms of\nfrequency and intensity. We will continue to follow these operations hoping such reporting can help to\nprevent and mitigate these attacks in many areas.
