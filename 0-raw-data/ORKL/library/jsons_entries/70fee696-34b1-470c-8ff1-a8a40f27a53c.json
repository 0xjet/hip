    "plain_text": "# How China’s cybercrime underground is making money off big data\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/china-cybercrime-big-data-privacy-laws](https://intel471.com/blog/china-cybercrime-big-data-privacy-laws/)**\n\nApr 19, 2021\n\nBoth of these things are true: Big data is big business, and cybercriminals love money. So it\nshouldn’t be a surprise that these two ideas have blended together in some corners of the\ncybercrime underground.\n\nThrough Intel 471’s observation and analysis of open source information and behavior on\nmultiple closed forums, we found actors adopting the use of legitimate big data technology\nfor cybercrime and monetizing the data they obtain on the Chinese-language underground.\n\nThe behavior we have analyzed points to a cycle that involves several different layers of\ncybercriminals, the use of insider information, and unwitting victims in order to earn illgotten gains. The schemes themselves proliferate partly due to China’s desire to be a global\nepicenter in big data analytics, especially as it pushes to become synonymous with new\ntechnology sectors like the Internet of Things (IoT). With China injecting big data into every\neconomic sector, the environment has become ripe for criminals to create and execute\nschemes that hide in the noise brought on by the amount of data at hand.\n\n## Why the schemes work\n\nAs big data becomes a key cog in Chinese industry, the management, regulation, and\ngovernance around data has become a growing challenge for the country. Like much of the\nindustrialized economies in the world, China’s big data sector is worth hundreds of billions of\ndollars.\n\n[A 2019 report compiled by the China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1652603819656879512&wfr=spider&for=pc)\nTeam (CICS-CERT) that examined more than 3,000 big data-related companies found that\nthe industry was worth more than 800 billion yuan (about US $122 billion) in 2019. By the\nend of 2020, the report projected the industry’s worth to exceed 1 trillion yuan (about US\n$156 billion). [Another report published earlier this year by a Chinese think tank found big](http://mp.ofweek.com/bigdata/a256714466057)\ndata practices were well integrated with the communications, finance, internet and security\nindustries. Increasingly, it is also becoming a key part of business in sectors such as energy,\nindustry and transportation.\n\nThat growth has not been paired with oversight. We observed several problems documented\nin open source articles that reported the increased difficulty of regulating and governing big\ndata. The lines between private and public data are not clearly defined, while security risks in\n\n\n-----\n\ndata collection, storage and sharing add to the challenges from a security perspective. The\ncorrect usage and protection of personal information in China is largely dependent on the\ncompanies themselves.\n\n## How the scheme works\n\nWe have observed the a data underground monetization chain within the Chinese-language\nunderground consisting of the following groups or individuals with a clear division of labor,\nresponsibilities and a delineated chain of command that includes:\n\nA boss or requester who requires data for illegal use or commands a group or syndicate\ndealing with illegal products or services.\nInsiders or hackers who receive instructions directly from a boss and can gain access to\nraw data and extract the information from a service provider. These individuals profit\nfrom the information they provide to the main boss or requester.\nMiddlemen who act as intermediaries for the boss and any other individuals requesting\nto purchase such data products. The middlemen profit by taking a cut of the\ncommission from product sales.\nEscrow and underground platforms which serve as an avenue for the syndicate or\nmiddlemen to advertise their products. End users, such as scammers, multiple types of\nthreat actors and even direct marketers can purchase the data or engage the services of\nsuch syndicates directly on these platforms.\n\nThe graphic below shows how this chain tends to progress:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Where the schemes make money\n\nIntel 471 has observed numerous listings on forums popular in the Chinese cybercrime\nunderground, including:\n\nOne actor in January 2021 offered real-time data for casino gaming, lottery and stocks\non a popular forum used by chinese-linked cybercriminals. The data allegedly\noriginated from big data sources of the two of most popular mobile network operators\nin China.\nAn actor in February 2021 offered website and application crawler data collection\nservices on a Chinese-language cybercrime marketplace. The actor claimed to have\naccess to insider channels of Chinese mobile operators for data collection purposes.\nIn early March, an actor on a marketplace offered 10,000 user records tied to a\nparenting application. The offering was described as big data from an undisclosed\nmobile operator or operators.\nIn late March, another actor offered big data information for Canada and the U.S. that\nincluded commercial databases of Canadian and U.S. businesses and investors, a\nhacked Twitter database and Canadian and U.S. citizens’ information.\n\n## What is being done to stop the schemes\n\n\n-----\n\nChinese law enforcement has tried in recent years to hold companies accountable for how\nthey handle. In 2019, seemingly legitimate Chinese companies also were observed providing\nthird-party data crawling services and selling the data collected from unknown victims to\nreap a profit in addition to being exploited by underground threat actors. Our research\nidentified an article discussing the circumstances surrounding the arrests of the following\nindividuals and entities:\n\n**Sept. 12, 2019: Police apprehended the general manager, deputy general manager**\nand marketers of 天翼征信 (Eng. Tianyi Credit) for investigation. Tianyi Credit is a\nsubsidiary of the state-owned telecommunications service provider China Telecom\nCorp. Ltd.\n**Sept. 11, 2019: Law enforcement officers suspended and seized the operations of 杭州**\n存信数据科技有限公司 (Eng. Hangzhou Cunxin Data Technology Co. Ltd.) Hangzhou\nCunxin Data Technology Co. Ltd. is the physical entity operating 公信宝 (GXB), a\nblockchain-based decentralized data exchange.\n**Sept. 6, 2019: Police requested the CEO of 新颜科技人工智能科技有限公司 (Eng.**\nXinyan Artificial Intelligence Tech Co. Ltd.) assist in investigations.\n**Sept. 6, 2019: Law enforcement officers apprehended the CEO of the well-known**\nHangzhou-based big data service company 杭州魔蝎数据科技有限公司 (Eng. Hangzhou\nMagic Scorpion Data Technology Co. Ltd.) and placed restrictions on the company.\n\nAccording to the Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) on its annual\nname-and-shame television program 3.15晚会 (Eng. 3.15 Gala), another 11 companies were\nexposed for harassing people over the phone, marketing big-data related products and\nservices that are actually against Chinese privacy laws, and other violations of user privacy.\nAlthough the companies named were not large in operational scale, they were linked to a\nbigger group of well-known companies.\n\nChinese authorities reportedly adopted measures to crack down on the illegal big data trade\nand tighten regulations governing personal data and privacy. A series of regulatory measures\nregarding internet privacy protection and the security of personal information reportedly was\nintroduced by the Cyberspace Administration of China in addition to the large-scale\ncrackdown.\n\nNations that are highly digitized have struggled with privacy over the last decade. We’ve seen\nlaws like GDPR, CCPA, and PDPA put in place to help citizens exercise some control over the\ninformation they generate on the internet. However, if more scenarios like China’s\nunderground big data trade are replicated as other countries develop data-reliant economies,\nregulations and law enforcement are going to face an uphill battle in stopping data trading\nschemes. The prevalence of these schemes show the importance of securing the data\nbusinesses generate on the same levels as the services that keep business running on a dayto-day basis.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
