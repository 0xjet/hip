We believe that the main goal of�**\n**attackers using these tools is cybersabotage. This blog post outlines the details about the campaign that**\n**we discovered.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**attackers, and the toolset used, share a number of similarities with the BlackEnergy group, which**\n**[conducted attacks against the energy industry in Ukraine in December 2015 and January 2016. In fact, we](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/)**\n**think that the BlackEnergy group has evolved into the TeleBots group.**\n\n## Infection vector\n\n**As with campaigns attributed to BlackEnergy group the attackers used spearphishing emails with Microsoft**\n**Excel documents attached that contain malicious macros as an initial infection vector. This time malicious**\n**documents don’t have any content with social engineering directing potential victims to click an Enable**\n**Content button. It seems that the attackers are depending on the victims to decide entirely on their own**\n**whether to click it or not.**\n\n\n**Figure 1: One example of a malicious XLS document used in the spearphishing attack.**\n\n\n**Usually, the malicious documents don’t contain meaningful information in the metadata, but this time the**\n**metadata of the document contains the nickname of the person who is responsible for its modification.�**\n**Moreover, this nickname matches that of an individual who is actively communicating within a Russian-**\n**speaking community of cybercriminals. However, we should say that it is possible that this was intended**\n**deceptively as a false flag or a coincidence.�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Metadata reveals what might be the**\n\n**attacker’s nickname.**\n\n\n**Once a victim clicks on the Enable Content button, Excel executes the malicious macro. Our analysis**\n**shows that the code of the macro used in TeleBots documents matches the macro code that was used by**\n**the BlackEnergy group in 2015. Figure 3 illustrates these similarities.**\n\n**The main purpose of the macro is to drop a malicious binary using the explorer.exe filename and then�**\n**to execute it. The dropped binary belongs to a trojan downloader family, its main purpose being to**\n**download and execute another piece of malware. This trojan downloader is written in the Rust**\n**programming language.**\n\n**It should be noted that during the first stages of the attack, the TeleBots group abuse various legitimate�**\n**servers in order to hide malicious activity in the network. For example, the trojan downloader fetches data**\n**from a hardcoded URL that points to a text file on the putdrive.com service (which allows anyone to upload�**\n**and share files online). The text file that is hosted on the online service is a final payload, encoded using�**\n**the Base64 algorithm.**\n\n**[The final payload is a backdoor written in Python and detected as the �Python/TeleBot.AA trojan. This](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Python_TeleBot.AA/description)**\n**backdoor is the main piece of malware used by these attackers, which is why we’ve named the TeleBots**\n**group as such.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Similarities between malicious macro code used by BlackEnergy and TeleBots.**\n\n\n## Python/TeleBot.AA backdoor\n\n**[In January 2016 we published our analysis of a spearphishing attack against energy companies in Ukraine.](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/20/new-wave-attacks-ukrainian-power-industry/)**\n**That attack probably has a connection to the infamous BlackEnergy attacks in 2015 because the attackers**\n**used exactly the same mail server to send spearphishing messages. However, the attacks in January 2016**\n**were different. Instead of using the BlackEnergy malware family, the attackers used a relatively simple�**\n**open-source backdoor, written in the Python programming language, called GCat. The Python code of the**\n**GCat backdoor was obfuscated, then converted into a stand-alone executable using the PyInstaller**\n**program.**\n\n**The Python/TeleBot malware uses exactly the same approach; the Python backdoor code is obfuscated**\n**and packed into a standalone executable using PyInstaller. In addition, the Python code is ROT13**\n**encoded, AES encrypted, compressed using zlib library and then Base64 encoded.**\n\n**But what really makes this backdoor interesting is the way in which it communicates with attackers in**\n**[order to receive commands. Python/TeleBot abuses the Telegram Bot API from Telegram Messenger to](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)**\n**communicate with the attackers. The Telegram Bot API is based on HTTP and to a network administrator**\n**within a compromised network, the communication between the infected computer and the attackers will**\n**look like HTTP(S) communication with a legitimate server, specifically �api.telegram.org. We have**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: The Python/TeleBot.AA malware code that uses Telegram Bot API.**\n\n\n**Each of the samples we discovered has a unique token embedded in its code, which means that each**\n**sample uses its own Telegram Messenger account. Python/TeleBot uses private chats for communicating**\n**with the cybercriminals. This scheme allows the control of infected computers through any device with**\n**Telegram Messenger installed, even from a smartphone, just by issuing commands via chat.**\n\n**The Python/TeleBot malware has support for following commands:**\n\n**Command** **Purpose**\n\n**cmd|| %shellcmd%** **Executes shell command and sends result in chat**\n\n**cmdd|| %shellcmd%** **Executes shell command but does not send result in chat**\n\n**getphoto|| %path%** **Uploads picture from infected computer to chat**\n\n**getdoc|| %path%** **Uploads any type of file up to 50 MB in size to chat�**\n\n**forcecheckin|| %random%** **Collects Windows version, platform (x64 or x86), current privileges**\n\n**time|| %seconds%** **Changes interval between execution of commands**\n\n**ss||** **Captures screenshot (not implemented)**\n\n**In addition, the malware automatically saves all incoming files from the attacker to its own folder. By this�**\n**means, attackers can push additional malicious tools to an infected computer. During our research, we**\n**were able to find a Telegram account belonging to one of the attackers.�**\n\n|Command|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|cmd|| %shellcmd%|Executes shell command and sends result in chat|\n|cmdd|| %shellcmd%|Executes shell command but does not send result in chat|\n|getphoto|| %path%|Uploads picture from infected computer to chat|\n|getdoc|| %path%|Uploads any type of file up to 50 MB in size to chat�|\n|forcecheckin|| %random%|Collects Windows version, platform (x64 or x86), current privileges|\n|time|| %seconds%|Changes interval between execution of commands|\n|ss|||Captures screenshot (not implemented)|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: Profile of one of the attackers in Telegram Messenger.�**\n\n\n**It should be noted that the Telegram Bot API was not the** **_only legitimate protocol that was used by these_**\n**attackers. We have seen at least one sample of this backdoor that uses an outlook.com mailbox as C&C.**\n\n## Password stealing malicious tools\n\n**After successful compromise of the network, attackers use various malicious tools in order to collect**\n**passwords, allowing them to subsequently perform a lateral movement within the compromised LAN.**\n\n**A string, that contains a PDB-path to debug symbols, suggests one such tool was named** **CredRaptor by**\n**the attackers. This tool collects saved passwords from various browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet**\n**Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.**\n\n\n**Figure 6: PDB-Path reveals the name of the password stealer.**\n\n\n**The attackers are using a tool with name** **plainpwd in order to dump Windows credentials from memory.**\n**This tool is a slightly modified version of the open-source project �mimikatz.**\n\n**In addition to plainpwd and CredRaptor the toolkit includes a keylogger. The keylogger uses a standard**\n**technique to capture keystrokes, specifically the �SetWindowsHookEx function.**\n\n**In order to also sniff passwords in network traffic, the attackers use a console version of Interceptor-NG.�**\n**Since it requires WinPcap drivers to be installed, the attackers made a custom tool to install them silently.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: Intercepter-NG password sniffing tool.�**\n\n\n**The combined use of all these tools allows attackers to gain a foothold in a compromised network, with the**\n**objective of gaining full control by obtaining domain administrator privileges.**\n\n## LDAP query tool\n\n**Another interesting discovery was a tool that was used during attacks to make queries to Active Directory**\n**using LDAP. This tool is able to dump detailed information about computers and usernames listed in Active**\n**Directory, and is tailored for a specific victim’s domain.�**\n\n\n**Figure 8: Disassembled code of the tailored LDAP query tool.**\n\n\n## Additional backdoor\n\n**Further research revealed that the attackers deployed additional backdoors in order to regain access to the**\n**compromised network, should their main Python/TeleBot backdoor be discovered and removed. This**\n**additional backdoor is written in VBS and some samples we discovered were packaged using the**\n**script2exe program.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Source code of additional backdoor written in VBS.**\n\n\n**There are several samples of this VBS backdoor, but all of them have pretty straightforward functionality.**\n**The backdoor sends the computer name and MAC address of the computer executing it to its C&C server**\n**using HTTP. The variable timeout defines the period of time in minutes between calls to the server. The�**\n**server can push additional commands for execution. Here is a list of supported commands:**\n\n**Command** **Purpose**\n\n**!cmd** **Executes shell command and sends results back to the server**\n\n**!cmdd** **Executes shell command but does not send result back to the server**\n\n**!dump** **DecodesBase64 data and saves it to %TEMP% folder**\n\n**!timeout** **Defines a new timeout between calls to server�**\n\n**!bye** **Quits**\n\n**!kill** **Quits and deletes itself**\n\n**!up** **Uploads file from agent computer to C&C server�**\n\n## BCS-server\n\n**The attackers also used a malicious tool that they named BCS-server. This tool allows them to open a**\n**tunnel into an internal network and then this tunnel can be used to send and receive data between the C&C**\n**server and even non-infected computers in the network. The main idea of this tool is based on the same**\n**[principles as the XTUNNEL malware used by the Sednit group](http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-part-2.pdf#36)** **.**\n\n**During our analysis we discovered that the attackers used a guide for this specific tool. Interestingly, the�**\n**guide was written in Russian.**\n\n|Command|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|!cmd|Executes shell command and sends results back to the server|\n|!cmdd|Executes shell command but does not send result back to the server|\n|!dump|DecodesBase64 data and saves it to %TEMP% folder|\n|!timeout|Defines a new timeout between calls to server�|\n|!bye|Quits|\n|!kill|Quits and deletes itself|\n|!up|Uploads file from agent computer to C&C server�|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10: Guide for BCS-server in Russian.**\n\n\n**The guide in Russian can be roughly translated as:**\n\n**_Parameters_**\n**_-saddr – address of BCS server_**\n**_-hport – port of a host, which we did setup on the server, this how we bypass firewall�_**\n**_Examples:_**\n**_phost_win.exe –saddr=10.10.10.10 –hport=80_**\n**_Debug versions:_**\n**_phost_cnv.exe – console version_**\n**_phost_win_log.exe – version that logs to file�_**\n\n**So attackers specify an external C&C server in the command line and the tool connects to this server using**\n**HTTP. This remote server is used as a proxy by attackers: the connection that goes to this server is**\n**redirected to the internal network by the tool and any response that the tool gets from a computer in the**\n**internal network goes to the C&C server. Thus, attackers can communicate with internal servers that are**\n**normally unreachable from the internet.**\n\n**The communication traffic between the BCS-server tool and the C&C server is base64 encoded and�**\n**encapsulated in HTML tags.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11: The captured handshake of BCS-server tool and C&C server.**\n\n\n## KillDisk\n\n**The KillDisk is a destructive component that is used by these attackers as the final stage of an attack.�**\n**Previous versions of this component were used in attacks against media companies in November 2015 and**\n**[against power grid companies in Ukraine in December 2015.](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/)**\n\n**KillDisk is designed to run with high privileges, this time it registers itself as a service under** **Plug-And-**\n**Play Support name. Since at the final stage attackers have probably collected network administrator�**\n**level credentials, that’s why they are using Microsoft PsExec in order to execute KillDisk with the highest**\n**possible privileges on servers and workstations.**\n\n**The attackers may specify an activation date of KillDisk via the command line. However, one of the**\n**samples had a predefined activation time that is set to 9:30am, 6 December 2016.�**\n\n**There are improvements in the code, however the main idea of KillDisk hasn’t change so much – it deletes**\n**important system files and makes computer unbootable. Beside that it also overwrites files with specific file�**\n**extensions – those defined by the malware authors in this version of KillDisk are:�**\n\n**.kdbx .bak .back .dr .bkf .cfg .fdb .mdb .accdb .gdb .wdb .csv .sdf .myd .dbf .sql .edb .mdf .ib .db3**\n**.db4 .accdc .mdbx .sl3 .sqlite3 .nsn .dbc .dbx .sdb .ibz .sqlite .pyc .dwg .3ds .ai .conf .my .ost .pst .mkv**\n**.mp3 .wav .oda .sh .py .ps .ps1 .php .aspx .asp .rb .js .git .mdf .pdf .djvu .doc .docx .xls .xlsx .jar .ppt**\n**.pptx .rtf .vsd .vsdx .jpeg .jpg .png .tiff .msi .zip .rar .7z .tar .gz .eml .mail .ml .ova .vmdk .vhd .vmem .vdi�**\n**.vhdx .vmx .ovf .vmc .vmfx .vmxf .hdd .vbox .vcb .vmsd .vfd .pvi .hdd .bin .avhd .vsv .iso .nrg .disk .hdd**\n**.pmf .vmdk .xvd**\n\n**The KillDisk malware may create new, small files instead of deleted ones with the exact same filename and�**\n**these new files will contain one of two strings �mrR0b07 or fS0cie7y instead of the original content This**\n\n\n-----\n\n**is illustrated in Figure 12.**\n\n\n**Figure 12: Picture displayed by KillDisk component.**\n\n\n**Interestingly, the KillDisk malware does not store this picture anywhere: rather it has code that draws this**\n**picture in real-time using the Windows GDI. It looks like attackers put a lot of effort just to make the code�**\n**that draws this picture.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The cybercriminals behind these targeted attacks demonstrate serious intention to conduct cybersabotage**\n**attacks. To be able to mount such attacks, they are constantly inventing new malware and techniques, such**\n**as the use of the Telegram Bot API instead of a more conventional C&C server for example.**\n\n**_Special thanks to David Gabris for help with the analysis._**\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)\n\n**TeleBots IoCs are also available on ESET’s** **[GitHub repository.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/telebots)**\n\n**ESET detection names:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Win32/TrojanDownloader.Agent.CWY trojan**\n**Python/TeleBot.AA trojan**\n**Python/Agent.Q trojan**\n**Python/Agent.AE trojan**\n**Python/Agent.AD trojan**\n**VBS/Agent.AQ trojan**\n**VBS/Agent.AO trojan**\n\n**VBS/Agent.AP trojan**\n**Win32/HackTool.NetHacker.N trojan**\n**Win32/HackTool.NetHacker.O trojan**\n**Win32/PSW.Agent.OCO trojan**\n**Win64/Riskware.Mimikatz.H application**\n**Win32/RiskWare.Mimikatz.I application**\n**Win32/PSW.Delf.OQU trojan**\n**Win32/PSW.Agent.OCP trojan**\n**Win64/Spy.KeyLogger.G trojan**\n**Win32/KillDisk.NBH trojan**\n**Win32/KillDisk.NBI trojan**\n\n**C&C Servers:**\n\n**93.190.137.212**\n**95.141.37.3**\n**80.233.134.147**\n\n**Legitimate servers abused by malware authors:**\n\n**srv70.putdrive.com (IP: 188.165.14.185)**\n**api.telegram.org (IP: 149.154.167.200, 149.154.167.197, 149.154.167.198,**\n**149.154.167.199)**\n**smtp-mail.outlook.com (IP: 65.55.176.126)**\n\n**XLS documents with malicious macro SHA-1:**\n\n**7FC462F1734C09D8D70C6779A4F1A3E6E2A9CC9F**\n**C361A06E51D2E2CD560F43D4CC9DABE765536179**\n\n**Win32/TrojanDownloader.Agent.CWY SHA-1:**\n\n**F1BF54186C2C64CD104755F247867238C8472504**\n\n**Python/TeleBot.AA backdoor SHA-1:**\n\n**16C206D9CFD4C82D6652AFB1EEBB589A927B041B**\n**1DC1660677A41B6622B795A1EB5AA5E5118D8F18**\n\n\n-----\n\n**30D2DA7CAF740BAAA8A1300EE48220B3043A327D**\n**385F26D29B46FF55C5F4D6BBFD3DA12EB5C33ED7**\n**4D5023F9F9D0BA7A7328A8EE341DBBCA244F72C5**\n**57DAD9CDA501BC8F1D0496EF010146D9A1D3734F**\n**68377A993E5A85EB39ADED400755A22EB7273CA0**\n**77D7EA627F645219CF6B8454459BAEF1E5192467**\n**7B87AD4A25E80000FF1011B51F03E48E8EA6C23D**\n**7C822F0FDB5EC14DD335CBE0238448C14015F495**\n**86ABBF8A4CF9828381DDE9FD09E55446E7533E78**\n**9512A8280214674E6B16B07BE281BB9F0255004B**\n\n**B2E9D964C304FC91DCAF39FF44E3C38132C94655**\n**FE4C1C6B3D8FDC9E562C57849E8094393075BC93**\n\n**VBS backdoors SHA-1:**\n\n**F00F632749418B2B75CA9ECE73A02C485621C3B4**\n**06E1F816CBAF45BD6EE55F74F0261A674E805F86**\n\n**35D71DE3E665CF9D6A685AE02C3876B7D56B1687**\n**F22CEA7BC080E712E85549848D35E7D5908D9B49**\n**C473CCB92581A803C1F1540BE2193BC8B9599BFE**\n\n**BCS-server SHA-1:**\n\n**4B692E2597683354E106DFB9B90677C9311972A1**\n**BF3CB98DC668E455188EBB4C311BD19CD9F46667**\n\n**Modified Mimikatz SHA-1:�**\n\n**B0BA3405BB2B0FA5BA34B57C2CC7E5C184D86991**\n**AD2D3D00C7573733B70D9780AE3B89EEB8C62C76**\n**D8614BC1D428EBABCCBFAE76A81037FF908A8F79**\n\n**LDAP query tool SHA-1:**\n\n**81F73C76FBF4AB3487D5E6E8629E83C0568DE713**\n\n**CredRaptor password stealer SHA-1:**\n\n**FFFC20567DA4656059860ED06C53FD4E5AD664C2**\n**58A45EF055B287BAD7B81033E17446EE6B682E2D**\n\n**Win64/Spy.KeyLogger.G trojan SHA-1:**\n\n**7582DE9E93E2F35F9A63B59317EBA48846EEA4C7**\n\n\n-----\n\n**64CB897ACC37E12E4F49C4DA4DFAD606B3976225**\n**A0B9A35675153F4933C3E55418B6566E1A5DBF8A**\n\n**Win32/KillDisk SHA-1:**\n\n**71A2B3F48828E4552637FA9753F0324B7146F3AF**\n**8EB8527562DDA552FC6B8827C0EBF50968848F1A**\n\n**28**\n\n**LikeLike** **[Whats app](whatsapp://send?text=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/13/rise-telebots-analyzing-disruptive-killdisk-attacks/)**\n\n### You might also be interested in:\n\n**[Modern attacks on Russian financial institutions�](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/12/modern-attacks-russian-financial-institutions/)** **[Stegano exploit kit poisoning pixels](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/06/stegano-exploit-kit/)**\n\n**[Dorkbot: Life after disruption](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/02/dorkbot-life-disruption/)** **[Avalanche takedown: Check if you are safe](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/01/avalanche-takedown-check-safe/)**\n\n### Follow us\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sign up to our newsletter**\n\n**The latest security news direct to your inbox**\n\n\n**Email...**\n\n\n**[About Us](http://www.welivesecurity.com/about-us/)**\n\n**[Contact Us](http://www.welivesecurity.com/contact-us/)**\n\n**Home**\n\n**[How To](http://www.welivesecurity.com/category/how-to/)**\n\n**Expert Opinion**\n\n**[Videos](http://www.welivesecurity.com/media/videos/)**\n\n**[Papers](http://www.welivesecurity.com/papers/conference-papers/)**\n\n**[Our Experts](http://www.welivesecurity.com/our-experts/)**\n\n**[Virus Radar](http://www.virusradar.com/)**\n\n**[Sitemap](http://www.welivesecurity.com/sitemap/)**\n\n**[Privacy policy](http://www.welivesecurity.com/privacy/)**\n\n**[Legal Information](http://www.welivesecurity.com/legal-information/)**\n\n**COPYRIGHT © 2016 ESET, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.**\n\n\n**Submit**\n\n\n-----",
