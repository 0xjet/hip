For instance, the US Department of Justice named the group as being responsible for the Democratic National\nCommittee (DNC) hack just before the US 2016 elections. The group is also presumed to be behind the hacking of global television network\nTV5Monde, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) email leak, and many others. This group has a diversified set of malware tools in its\n[arsenal, several examples of which we have documented previously in our Sednit white paper from 2016.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-full.pdf)\n\n[Meanwhile, ESET researchers released a whitepaper on LoJax, a UEFI rootkit we attribute to Sednit, used against organizations in the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/27/lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-found-wild-courtesy-sednit-group/)\nBalkans, and Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn August 2018, Sednit’s operators deployed two new Zebrocy components, and since then we have seen an uptick in Zebrocy deployments.\nZebrocy is a set of downloaders, droppers and backdoors; while downloaders and droppers are doing reconnaissance, backdoors implement\npersistence and spying activities against the target. These new components use a an unusual way to exfiltrate gathered information by using\nprotocols related to mail services such as SMTP and POP3.\n\n\n-----\n\ne ct s ta geted by t ese e co po e ts a e s a to ct s e t o ed ou p e ous [eb ocy post a d by](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/) [aspe s y](https://securelist.com/masha-and-these-bears/84311/) e ta gets\nof such attacks are located in Central Asia, as well as countries in Central and Eastern Europe, notably embassies, ministries of foreign\naffairs, and diplomats.\n\n## The big picture\n\nFor two years now, the Sednit group has primarily used phishing emails as the infection vector for Zebrocy campaigns (Case 1 and Case 2).\nOnce the targets have been compromised, they use different first stage downloaders to gather information about the victims and, should the\nvictims be interesting enough, after a delay of several hours – or even days – they deploy one of their second-level backdoors.\n\nThe classic modus operandi for a Zebrocy campaign is for the victim to receive an archive attached to an email. This archive contains two\nfiles, one a benign document and one an executable. The operator tries to fool the victim by naming the executable with an apparent\ndocument or image file name by incorporating the “double extension” trick..\n\nThis new campaign, depicted as Case 3 in Figure 1, uses a more involved procedure. We dissect this process below.\n\n## Delphi dropper\n\nThe first binary is a Delphi dropper, which is kind of unusual for a Zebrocy campaign. Most of the time it’s a downloader rather than a dropper\nthat is installed on the victim system as the first stage.\n\nThis dropper contains some tricks to make it more difficult to reverse-engineer. It uses a keyword – liver in the samples we described here –\nto mark the start and end of key elements as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\n$ yara -s tag_yara.yar SCANPASS_QXWEGRFGCVT_323803488900X_jpeg.exe\n\nfind_tag SCANPASS_QXWEGRFGCVT_323803488900X_jpeg.exe\n\n0x4c260:$tag: l\\x00i\\x00v\\x00e\\x00r\\x00\n\n0x6f000:$tag: liver\n\n0x6f020:$tag: liver\n\n0x13ab0c:$tag: liver\n\n\nThe YARA rule above looks for the string liver. The first liver is the one used in the code and it doesn’t separate anything from anything,\nwhile the others separate the key descriptor, the image (hexdump below) and the encrypted payload in the dropper.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n$ hexdump -Cn 48 -s 0x6f000 SCANPASS_QXWEGRFGCVT_323803488900X_jpeg.exe\n\n0006f000 6c 69 76 65 72 4f 70 65 6e 41 69 72 33 39 30 34 |liverOpenAir3904|\n\n0006f010 35 5f 42 61 79 72 65 6e 5f 4d 75 6e 63 68 65 6e |5_Bayren_Munchen|\n\n0006f020 6c 69 76 65 72 ff d8 ff e0 00 10 4a 46 49 46 00 |liver……JFIF.|\n\n\nStarting with the image, this is dropped as C:\\Users\\public\\Pictures\\scanPassport.jpg if a file of that name does not already exist.\nInterestingly, the dropper’s filename, SCANPASS_QXWEGRFGCVT_323803488900X_jpeg.exe, also hints at a phishing scheme revolving\naround traveling or passport information. This might indicate that the operator knew the phishing message’s target. The dropper opens the\nimage: if the file exists, it stops executing; otherwise, it drops the image, opens it, and retrieves the key descriptor\n**_OpenAir39045_Bayren_Munchen. The image doesn’t seem to display anything while the file format is valid; see Figure 2._**\n\n\n-----\n\ne ey desc pto s st g co ta s **_ay e __** **_u c e_** c see s e y to e e to t e Ge a socce tea C aye u c\nRegardless, it is not the content of the key descriptor – but its length – that matters, with that length used to retrieve the XOR key used to\nencrypt the payload.\n\nTo get the XOR key, the dropper looks for the last liver keyword and adds the offset of the key descriptor. The length of the XOR key – 27\n(0x1b) bytes – is the same as that of the key descriptor.\n\nUsing the XOR key and a simple XOR loop, the dropper decrypts the last part – which is the encrypted payload – right after the last tag until\nthe end of the file. Notice that the executable payload’s MZ header starts right after the keyword liver and the XOR key retrieved from a part\nof the PE header that is normally a sequence of 0x00 bytes, which are restored once the payload is decrypted, as seen in Figure 3.\n\nIt drops the payload as C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\AcrobatReader.txt and moves the file to\n**_C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\AcrobatReader.exe_**\n\nPerhaps this is an attempt to avoid endpoint protection systems triggering an alert based on a binary dropping a file with a .exe extension.\n\nOnce again, the operator tries to fool victims in the event that they take a look at the directory, in which case they’ll see the file displayed as in\nFigure 4:\n\n\n-----\n\ny de au t, do s des t e e te s o, a d t s s e e aged by t e ope ato to d op a e ecutab e a ocu e ts d ecto y a d t a es t\nlook like a PDF file.\n\nFinally, the dropper executes its freshly-dropped payload, and exits.\n\n## MSIL mail downloader\n\nThe payload of the previous dropper is a UPX-packed MSIL downloader. To make the process easier to understand, the main logic is\ndescribed below, followed by source code, then an overview of the dissected control flow.\n\nThe Main method calls Run to start the application, which then creates the form Form1.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n{\n\nApplication.EnableVisualStyles();\n\nApplication.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);\n\nApplication.Run((Form) new Form1());\n\n}\n\n\n**_[Form1 initiates a lot of variables, including a new Timer for seven of them.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timers.timer)_**\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\nthis.start = new Timer(this.components);\n\nthis.inf = new Timer(this.components);\n\nthis.txt = new Timer(this.components);\n\nthis.subject = new Timer(this.components);\n\nthis.run = new Timer(this.components);\n\nthis.load = new Timer(this.components);\n\nthis.screen = new Timer(this.components);\n\n\nA Timer object has three important fields:\n\nEnabled: indicates if the timer is active.\nInterval: the time, in milliseconds, between elapsed events.\nTick: the callback executed when the timer interval has elapsed and the timer is enabled.\n\nHere these fields are initialized as:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\nthis.start.Enabled = true;\n\nthis.start.Interval = 120000;\n\nthis.start.Tick += new EventHandler(this.start_Tick);\n\nthis.inf.Interval = 10000;\n\nthis.inf.Tick += new EventHandler(this.inf_Tick);\n\nthis.txt.Interval = 120000;\n\nthis.txt.Tick += new EventHandler(this.txt_Tick);\n\nthis.subject.Interval = 120000;\n\nthis.subject.Tick += new EventHandler(this.subject_Tick);\n\nthis.run.Interval = 60000;\n\nthis.run.Tick += new EventHandler(this.run_Tick);\n\nthis.load.Interval = 120000;\n\nthis.load.Tick += new EventHandler(this.load_Tick);\n\nthis.screen.Interval = 8000;\n\nthis.screen.Tick += new EventHandler(this.screen_Tick);\n\n\nFor each object, it sets an Interval which is from 8 seconds to 2 minutes. A callback is added to the event handler. Notice that start is the\nonly one that sets Enabled as true, meaning that after 2 minutes (12000 milliseconds = 120 seconds) start_Tick will be called by the event\nhandler.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\nprivate void start_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)\n\n{\n\ntry\n\n{\n\nthis.start.Enabled = false;\n\nLenor lenor = new Lenor();\n\nthis.dir = !Directory.Exists(this.label15.Text.ToString()) ? this.label16.Text.ToString() + \"\\\" : this.label15.Text.ToString() + \"\\\";\n\nthis.att = this.dir + \"audev.txt\";\n\nthis._id = lenor.id(this.dir);\n\nthis.inf.Enabled = true;\n\n}\n\n\nThereafter each method has the same behavior: it sets the Enabled variable to false at the beginning of the method. The method occurs, and\nafterwards sets the Enabled variable of the next object to true, which will activate the next timer. The Enabled variable is used by the\noperator to put in place a kind of state machine: if the functions fail, this is a mechanism to repeat failed functions until they succeed. The time\nbetween the execution of two functions might be an attempt to evade endpoint protection systems by adding a delay.\n\nNow the structure of each method is defined; the following part will focus on the control flow of the malware.\n\nAs the exchanges happen between different email inboxes, here is an overview of the different steps.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the early checks made by the malware is for the existence of a specific path used to drop every file used during its execution. If\npossible, it uses C:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\ — otherwise it will fall back to C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Documents\\ as its default\ndirectory. Notice that the latter path is specific to Windows XP while the former is for Vista and above.\n\nA 16-byte id is generated by concatenating the C: volume serial number and the UserName, and stored in the file audev.txt.\n\nThe downloader gathers the following information:\n\ncurrent path of the application\noperating system version\nsystem directory\nuser domain\nmachine name\nUserName\ncurrent time zone\ncurrent date\nlogical drive list and information about each of them (model, serial number, etc…)\ndirectory listing of C:\\Program Files\\ and C:\\Program Files (x86)\\\nprocess list\n\nAll this information is stored in the C:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\si.ini file and sent in an email message, as an attachment, via SMTPS, using the\ndefault port 465. The email body contains the string SI (which probably stands for System Information), the recipient is sym777.g@post.cz.\nF ll il h th ’ S bj t t t th **_id_**\n\n\n-----\n\ne ope ato c ooses to a e u t p e a bac add esses a d se ds t e sa e e a to t o ot e, d e e t ec p e ts, p esu ab y case t e\nmain one is not working. Once the email has been sent, the downloader deletes the si.ini file.\n\nFor the first execution of the malware, it creates the file set.txt with {System_Parametrs = 10} inside and creates the Windows registry entry:\n\nOne screenshot of the victim’s computer is taken under the name scx.bin and sent as an email attachment with SC (which probably stands\nfor Screenshot) in the email’s body.\n\nAfter dispatch, this malware connects to the kae.mezhnosh@post.cz mailbox via POP3 over SSL (port 995) and looks for messages with a\nSubject: that corresponds to its own id. If there is such a message and the body is not empty, the malware hex decodes it and then sends a\nmessage with okey in the body to sym777.g@post.cz. The content of the email previously retrieved is cleaned and parsed as below:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nstring[] strArray = this._adr.Replace(\"B&\", \"\").Replace(\"Db\", \"\").Split('%');\n\nstring str1 = strArray[0];\n\nstring str2 = strArray[1];\n\n\nTwo strings are obtained: the first one is a password and the second is a username for an email address.\n\nThese new credentials are used to connect to the specified inbox freshly collected, and to also look there for a message with a subject that\nmatches the malware’s id as well as an attachment with the string audev in its filename. If both conditions are met, the malware saves the\nattachment and deletes the message from the server.\n\nAll logging messages are sent to sym777.g@post.cz while messages retrieved via POP3 come from credentials recently obtained.\n\nThese decisions from the operators make forensics more difficult. First, if you have the downloader with emails, you can’t connect to the\nmailbox that contains the next stage.\n\nSecond, if you retrieve the email credentials, you still can’t get the next payload because it was deleted after retrieval.\n\nOnce the downloader successfully writes the attachment to disk, it sends an email with okey2 in the body and an attachment, named l.txt,\ncontaining 090. The same file is overwritten with 000 and the malware tries to retrieve another message. Again – if it works – the l.txt file is\nsent with body text of okey3. The content of the attachment is a directory and a filename. The malware moves the audev file to this filepath.\nFinally, the malware sends an email with a body message of okey4 and l.txt as attachment. It starts the executable — audev.exe and checks\nin the list of processes to see if one of them contains the string audev.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\nProcess.Start(this.rn);\n\nforeach (Process process in Process.GetProcesses())\n\n{\n\nif (process.ProcessName.Contains(\"audev\"))\n\n}\n\n\nIf a process with such a name is found, it sends a last email with okey5 as the body message and l.txt as the attachment. Finally, it deletes\n**_l.txt and set.txt, deletes the Windows registry key it created, and exits._**\n\n## Delphi mail downloader\n\nThe main role of this downloader is to assess the importance of the compromised system and, if it is deemed important enough, to download\nand execute Zebrocy’s last downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\ne b a y s tte e p a d pac ed t U e co p ete de t o o t e **_o_** object ca be ou d ts esou ce sect o a d\ncontains some configuration parameters used by the malware. The following sections focus on the initialization, capabilities, and network\nprotocol of the downloader.\n\n## Initialization\n\n[At the beginning, it decrypts a bunch of strings that are email addresses and passwords. The operator uses the AES ECB encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_Codebook_(ECB))\nalgorithm. Each string is hex-encoded, with the first four bytes corresponding to the final size of the decrypted string (the decrypted strings\nmay contain some padding at the end). There are two AES keys in the TForm1 object; the first one is used to encrypt data while the second\nis used to decrypt.\n\nEmails and passwords are used by the operator to send commands to the malware and also to retrieve information harvested from the\nvictim’s computer. The communication protocols are SMTP and POP3 – both of them over SSL. To use OpenSSL, the malware drops and\nuses two OpenSSL dynamic link libraries (DLLs): libeay32.dll (98c348cab0f835d6cf17c3a31cd5811f86c0388b) and ssleay32.dll\n(6d981d71895581dfb103170486b8614f7f203bdc).\n\nNotice that all files are dropped in the malware’s working directory, C:\\Users\\Public\\\n\n[The persistence is done during the first execution of the malware using a well-known technique, the “Logon scripts”. It creates a script file](http://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2014/11/14/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-18/)\n**_registration.bat and writes several strings from the TForm1 object. The final script is:_**\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nreg add HKCU\\Environment /v \"UserInitMprLogonScript\" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\audev.exe\" /f\n\ndel C:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\registr.bat\n\nexit\n\n\nLast but not least, the malware creates an id, in the same way as seen in previous Zebrocy binaries. It retrieves the UserName via the\n**_GetUserNameW Windows API and prepends the volume serial number of the C:\\ drive._**\n\n## Capabilities\n\n\n-----\n\ne t e e a e so e co d t o s a d o de t e e ecut o o to co ect o at o about t e ct, t e o o g sect o desc bes\ndifferent gathering capabilities. The scan configuration is stored in the TForm1 object, grouped under seven different possibilities for\nretrieving information from the victim’s computer.\n\nStarting with a simple scan, the first information that the malware can collect is related to files with the following extensions: .docx, .xlsx,\n**_.pdf, .pptx, .rar, .zip, .jpg, .bmp, .tiff. For each file found on the disk, it retrieves the full path and the last modified date of the file. That_**\ninformation is encrypted using the AES key mentioned earlier and stored in the file 0.txt. Another scan targets the extensions .dat, .json, .db\nand like the previous scan it retrieves the full path and last modified date of the file. Then it encrypts them and it stores it under the file 57.txt.\n\nListing running processes is also one of the capabilities of this malware and it stores that information in the 08.txt file, and this looks like the\nlisting below:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\n======Listing_of_processes=======\n\n[System Process]\n\nSystem\n\nsmss.exe\n\ncsrss.exe\n\nwininit.exe\n\ncsrss.exe\n\nwinlogon.exe\n\nservices.exe\n\nlsass.exe\n\n[…]\n\n\nIn the file i.txt the malware gathers general information regarding the victim’s computer as well as some information about the malware, like\nthe version number and the path where it’s executed, as shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n\nv7.00\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\audev.txt\n\n============================================\n\nLog_Drivers:\n\nC: fixed; size= 102297 Mb, free=83927 Mb S/N: [redacted]\n\n==================================================\n\nOSV: Windows 7\n\nWinType: 32\n\nWinDir: C:\\Windows\n\nLang: English (United States)\n\nTZ: UTC1:0 Romance Standard Time\n\nHostN: [redacted]-PC\n\nUser: [redacted]\n\n===============S_LIST=====================\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\n\nC:\\Program Files\\desktop.ini\n\nC:\\Program Files\\DVD Maker\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft.NET\n\nC:\\Program Files\\MSBuild\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Reference Assemblies\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Uninstall Information\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender\n\n[…]\n\n\nThe malware is capable of taking screenshots, which are stored as 2\\[YYYY-mm-dd HH-MM-SS]-Image_001.jpg, and generates another file\n**_2\\sa.bin, populated with the path listing of all screenshots taken. Its last capability is network enumeration; the output is found as 4.txt._**\n\n## Network Protocol\n\nThe Delphi Mail Downloader is quite a new addition to Zebrocy’s toolset and it features a new way to exfiltrate data and retrieve commands\nfrom the operator. The exfiltration is quite simple but very noisy on the network, as all the encrypted files gathered previously are sent over\nSMTPS and each version of the file is sent three times.\n\n**Sender** **Recipient**\n\nkevin30@ambcomission.com rishit333@ambcomission.com\n\nsalah444@ambcomission.com rishit333@ambcomission.com\n\nkarakos3232@seznam.cz antony.miloshevich128@seznam.cz\n\nThe Subject: of the mail is the id of the victim and the file is sent as an attachment with a keyword corresponding to the file content. Notice\nthat for each file there is an encrypted version of the file sent.\n\n**files** **files encrypted** **keywords**\n\n - 0.txt SCAN\n\n57.txt 58.txt ACC\n\n08.txt 082.txt PrL\n\n\n-----\n\n**files** **files encrypted** **keywords**\n\ni.txt i2.txt SYS_INFO\n\n4.txt 42.txt GET_NETWORK\n\nScreenshots taken and files matching both scans are sent as well but with different keywords.\n\n**Content** **Keywords**\n\nscreenshots SC\n\n.docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .pptx, .rar, .zip, .jpg, .bmp, .tiff FILEs\n\n.dat, .json, .db D_ACC\n\nWhile the exfiltration uses SMTP, the binary connects to the email address tomasso25@ambcomission.com via POP3 and parses emails.\nThe body of the email contains different keywords that are interpreted as commands by the malware.\n\n**Keywords** **Purpose** **Log**\n\nscan scan\n\nldfile scan\n\nedit34 execute and delete\n\npKL90 register isreg\n\nprlist process listing\n\nStart23 execute isr\n\nnet40 enumerating network resources\n\ndele5 delete file isd\n\ndele6 delete directory isd\n\n\n-----\n\n**Keywords** **Purpose** **Log**\n\ncd25 create directory isc\n\nautodel delete itself\n\nCo55 copy file is_cp\n\nMo00 move file is_m\n\nOnce executed, a debug log and the result of the command, if any, are sent back to the operator. For example, for a scan command, the\noperator receives a file that contains the list of files matching the scan extensions along with each matching file.\n\nWhile this downloader has some backdoor features, it drops a Delphi downloader already associated with the group, and described in our\n[previous Zebrocy article.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the past, we identified an overlap between Zebrocy and other traditional Sednit malware. We caught Zebrocy dropping XAgent, the Sednit\nflagship backdoor. Thus, we attribute Zebrocy to the Sednit group with high confidence.\n\nHowever, the analysis of these binaries shows some mistakes at the language level as well as development decisions that indicate a different\nmaturity in the development of the toolset. Both downloaders are using mail protocols to exfiltrate information and share common\nmechanisms to gather the same information. Both are also very noisy on the network and on the system, as they create a lot of files and send\na lot of them over the network. While analyzing the Delphi mail downloader, some features seem to have disappeared but some strings still\nremain the binary.
