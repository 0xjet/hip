Attackers are targeting Windows\nplatform and aiming at government institutions as well as big companies in Colombia.\n\nThe first sample being captured was in April 2018 and since that we observed a lot more\nrelated ones. Attackers like to use spear-fishing email with password protected RAR\nattachment to avoid being detected by the email gateway. Decryption password is\nprovided in the mail body and inside the attachment it is a MHTML macro based document\nwith the .doc suffix. Its purpose is to implant Imminent backdoor and gain a foothold into\nthe target network which may make the follow up lateral movement easier to implement.\n\nAfter analyzing the last modified time of the encrypted documents, character set (locale) of\nthe MHTML files, author names used by attackers, as well as elements like geopolitics in\nAPT attacks, 360 Threat Intelligence Center suspect attackers come from South America\nand are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent ones).\n\n# Target and Victim Analysis\n\nAfter performing investigations on the classified victims, we find the attacker targets big\ncompanies and government agencies in Colombia. The purpose is to implant Imminent\nbackdoor to gain a foothold into the target network which may make the follow up lateral\nmovement easier to implement. Based upon victims’ backgrounds, the attacker is focusing\non strategic-level intelligence and may also have motivations to steal business intelligence\nand intellectual properties.\n\n## Spoofed Source and Industry Distribution\n\nBased on the statistics of the attack information collected by 360 Threat Intelligence\nCenter, the attacker disguised as Colombian national institutions to attack government\nagencies, financial institutions, large domestic companies and multinational corporation\nbranches in Colombia.\n\nSpoofed Source Target\n\nColombian National Civil Registry INCI (Colombian National Institute for the Blind)\n\n\n-----\n\nHocol (Subsidiary of Ecopetrol)\n\nWheel manufacturer in Colombia (IMSA)\n\nByington Colombia\n\nNational Administrative Department of Statistics Logistics company in Colombia (Almaviva)\n\nColombian National Cyber Police Bank in Colombia (Banco de Occidente)\n\nOffice of the Attorney General ATH Columbia Division\n\nBank in Colombia (Banco de Occidente)\n\nColombia Migration Sun Chemical Columbia Branch\n\nSome malicious domains used by the attacker also masquerade as Colombian\ngovernment websites. For example, “diangovcomuiscia.com” looks like the official one\n“muiscia.dian.gov.co” that belongs to the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs.\n\nThe attacker also forged the company information in the Imminent RAT:\n\nCompany Information in RAT Company Description\n\nAbbott Laboratories A healthcare company based in the United States\n\nChevron A multinational energy company in the United States\n\nEnergizer Holdings Inc. American battery manufacturer\n\nProgressive Corporation Auto insurance provider in America\n\nSimon Property Group Inc A commercial real estate company in America\n\nSports Authority Inc A sports goods retailer in the United States\n\nStrongeagle, Lda. A company related to law suit in Portugal\n\n## Affected Targets\n\nAfter monitoring and correlating the APT attack, 360 Threat Intelligence Center discovered\nmultiple related emails to attack Colombian government agencies, financial institutions\nand large enterprises. Based upon the above work, we collected the following spearfishing emails, bait documents and the corresponding victims.\n\n### Ecopetrol\n\n**Information and Related Email of the Attacked Corporation**\n\n[Ecopetrol, also known as Colombian Petroleum Co. (www.ecopetrol.com.co), is the largest](http://www.ecopetrol.com.co/)\nand primary petroleum company in Colombia.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Related Bait Document**\n\nThe document was disguised as originating from the National Directorate of Taxes and\nCustoms (www.dian.gov.co):\n\nDian Embargo Bancario # 609776.doc\n\n### Hocol Petroleum Limited\n\n**Information and Related Email of the Attacked Corporation**\n\nHocol was founded in 1956.

It is part of the Grupo Aval\nconglomerate of financial services in Colombia.\n\nTargeted Email Attack Against Banco de Occidente\n\n**Related Bait Document**\n\nThe bait document was spoofed from the Office of the Attorney General\n(www.fiscalia.gov.co):\n\n\n-----\n\nCitacion Fiscalia general de la Nacion Proceso 305351T.doc\n\n### ATH Columbia Division\n\n**Information and Related Email of the Attacked Corporation**\n\nATH is a multinational financial institution with a branch in Colombia.\n\nTargeted Email Attack Against ATH Columbia Branch\n\n**Related Bait Document**\n\nThe attacker pretends to come from the Office of the Attorney General\n(www.fiscalia.gov.co):\n\n\n-----\n\nFiscalia proceso 305351T.doc\n\n### Sun Chemical Columbia Branch\n\n**Information and Related Email of the Attacked Corporation**\n\nSun Chemical is a multinational chemical company focusing on inks, paint, etc. It also has\na branch in Colombia.\n\nTargeted Email Attack Against Sun Chemical Columbia Branch\n\n**Related Bait Document**\n\nThe bait document was spoofed from the Colombia Migration\n(www.migracioncolombia.gov.co):\n\n\n-----\n\nProceso Pendiente Migracion Colombia.doc\n\n### Byington Colombia\n\n**Information and Related Email of the Attacked Corporation**\n\nByington Colombia provides business credit management and information solutions. Its\nbusiness credit information services include business and credit information, commercial\ncollection, and marketing services.\n\nTargeted Email Attack Against Byington\n\n**Related Bait Document**\n\nThe document was disguised as originating from the National Directorate of Taxes and\nCustoms:\n\n\n-----\n\nestado de cuenta.doc\n\n# Technical Details\n\n360 Threat Intelligence Center conducted a detailed analysis of the attack process based\non the common attack techniques used by the APT group.\n\n## The Latest Attack\n\nOn February 14, 2019, 360 Threat Intelligence Center monitored attacks by the APT group\nagain. The corresponding mail was not found by using the recently captured bait\ndocument (MD5:0c97d7f6a1835a3fe64c1c625ea109ed). However, after investigation we\nfound another similar bait document (MD5: 3de286896c8eb68a21a6dcf7dae8ec97) and\nrelated target attack mail (MD5: f2d5cb747110b43558140c700dbf0e5e). The mail was\ndisguised from the Colombian National Civil Registry and attacked the Colombian National\nInstitute for the Blind.\n\nRecently captured bait document, disguised from the Colombian National Civil Registry\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail attacking the Colombian National Institute for the Blind\n\n## Spoofed Source and Detection Bypass\n\nWhen attacking different targets, attackers carefully consider how to spoof the source of\nthe message to make it look more credible. For example, by masquerading the National\nCivil Registry to attack the Institute for the Blind, pretending to be the Tax and Customs\nAdministration to attack companies with international trade, disguising as the judiciary and\nimmigration authorities against banks and multinational corporation branches located in\nColombia.\n\nThe attacker also carefully constructs the content of the message to appear originating\nfrom the forged institution and relating to the target. The following picture shows the\ntranslation of the corresponding mail disguised as originating from the judiciary of\nColombia to attack the ATH Colombia branch.\n\nThe email attachment is encrypted and stored in the compressed package, and a\ndecryption password is provided in the mail body to bypass the security detection of the\nemail gateway.\n\n\n-----\n\nDecryption password provided in the email\n\nAfter analyzing the mail, we found that the attacker used approaches such as proxy and\nVPN to hide its IP address when sending emails. So the sender’s real IP has not yet been\nobtained, only to figure out that these messages are sent through IDCs in Florida, USA.\nSome related IP addresses are as follows:\n\n128.90.106.22\n\n128.90.107.21\n\n128.90.107.189\n\n128.90.107.236\n\n128.90.108.126\n\n128.90.114.5\n\n128.90.115.28\n\n128.90.115.179\n\n## The Bait Document\n\nAll of the bait documents are MHTML ones with malicious macro embedded and the .doc\nsuffix to bypass detection. Below is an example of bait document captured by 360 Threat\nIntelligence Center in February 2019:\n\nFile Name Registraduria Nacional - Notificacion cancelacion cedula de ciudadania.doc\n\nMD5 0c97d7f6a1835a3fe64c1c625ea109ed\n\nForged Source The Colombian National Civil Registry\n\n\n-----\n\nMHTML macro based document with the .doc suffix\n\nThe document is disguised from the Colombian National Civil Registry and uses Spanish\nto prompt the victim to enable the macro code in order to execute the subsequent payload.\n\nWhen the macro code gets executed, it calls the Document_Open function automatically.\n\nFunction Document_Open first calls the Main function to download binary data from\nhxxp://diangovcomuiscia.com/media/a.jpg and save as %AppData%\\1.exe (MD5:\nef9f19525e7862fb71175c0bbfe74247).\n\n\n-----\n\nThen calls the fcL4qOb4 function to set the scheduled task and disguise as the one used\nby Google:\n\nAuthor Google Inc\n\n\nDescription\n(after\ntranslation)\n\n\nThis task stops the Google Telemetry Agent, that examines and uploads information\nabout the use and errors of Google solutions when a user logs in to the system.\n\n\nTask Action Launch %AppData%\\1.exe\n\n\nTask\nDefinition\n\n\nGoogleUpdate\n\n\nThe relevant code is shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFile Name 1.exe\n\nMD5 ef9f19525e7862fb71175c0bbfe74247\n\nCompiler .NET\n\nThe backdoor payload (1.exe) get dropped out is in C# with obfuscation:\n\nAfter deobfuscation you can see “Imminent Monitor” string which may indicate it is related\nto Imminent Monitor RAT:\n\nWhen get executed, it first extracts resource named as \"application\" and decrypt to a\nlegitimate lzma.dll library:\n\n\n-----\n\nThen extract resource named as \"_7z\", and decompress it with lzma.dll to get the\nImminent Monitor RAT (MD5: 4fd291e3319eb3433d91ee24cc39102e).\n\n### Core Component\n\nMD5 4fd291e3319eb3433d91ee24cc39102e\n\n**Static Analysis**\n\nIt is a variant of Imminent Monitor RAT while obfuscated by ConfuserEx and\nEazfuscator.NET:\n\nAfter partially removing the obfuscation, it can be seen that the backdoor supports below\nfunctions:\n\nID Function\n\n\n-----\n\nChatPacket User support\n\ncokLfFnjBwgKtzdTpdXSgQIPacR Registry management\n\nCommandPromptPacket Remote shell\n\nConnectionSocketPacket Network transmission channel management\n\nExecutePacket Upload, download, and execute PE files\n\nFastTransferPacket Fast transmission\n\nFilePacket File management\n\nFileThumbnailGallery Support file thumbnail library\n\nKeyLoggerPacket Keylogger\n\nMalwareRemovalPacket Malicious function management\n\nMessageBoxPacket Chat message\n\nMicrophonePacket Microphone chat\n\nMouseActionPacket Mouse action\n\nMouseButtonPacket Mouse button action\n\nNetworkStatPacket Host network management\n\nPacketHeader Packet header information\n\nPasswordRecoveryPacket Browser password recovery\n\nPluginPacket Plugin management\n\nProcessPacket Process management\n\nProxyPacket Proxy management\n\nRDPPacket Remote desktop\n\nRegistryPacket Registry operation\n\nRemoteDesktopPacket Mark remote desktop package\n\nScriptPacket Execute script (html, vbs and batch)\n\nSpecialFolderPacket Windows special folder\n\nStartupPacket Startup operation\n\nTcpConnectionPacket TCP refresh and shutdown\n\nThumbnailPacket Thumbnail related\n\nTransferHeader Connection operation\n\nWebcamPacket Webcam related\n\nWindowPacket Window operations (refresh, maximize, minimize, etc.)\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is consistent with the descriptions provided on the official website:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dynamic Debugging**\n\nThe core component will check whether it is located in the %temp%\\[appname] directory,\notherwise it copies itself to %temp%\\[appname]\\[appname] and set the file attribute to\nhidden.\n\nThen launch the copied file:\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally delete the original file and exit the process:\n\nWhen the copied file gets executed, it creates the Imminent directory in the %AppData%\ndirectory to save the encrypted log, network information and system information. The file\nwill be uploaded to C2 when related command is received.\n\nC2: mentes.publicvm.com:4050\n\n# TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)\n\n360 Threat Intelligence Center summarized TTPs of the APT group as follows:\n\n\nAttack\nTarget\n\nEarliest\nActivity\n\n\nColombian government agencies, large domestic corporations, and Colombian branch‐\nes of multinational corporations\n\nApril 2018\n\n\nRisk Remote control of computer device and data exfiltration\n\n\nAttack\nApproach\n\nInitial\nPayload\n\nMalicious\nCode\n\nCommuni‐\ncation\n\nAnti-de‐\ntection\ncapability\n\nAffected\nPlatform\n\n\nEmail\n\nMHTML macro based document with the .doc suffix\n\nImminent Backdoor\n\nDynamic domain name\n\nMedium\n\nWindows\n\n\n-----\n\nTactics load for delivery;\n\n2.Spear-fishing email with password protected attachment and MHTML macro based\ndocument to bypass detection;\n\n3.Disguised as national agencies in Colombia to attack Colombia’s government, finan‐\ncial institutions, large domestic companies or Colombian branches of multinational cor‐\nporations;\n\n4.Commercial Trojan Imminent is used to remotely control the target;\n\n# Attribution\n\nAfter analyzing the last modified time of the encrypted documents, character set (locale) of\nthe MHTML files, as well as elements like geopolitics in APT attacks, 360 Threat\nIntelligence Center suspect attackers are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent ones).\n\n## The Reliable Last Modified Time\n\nSince RAR will save the modified time of the file, the time of the document obtained after\ndecryption is very reliable. Take password protected RAR archive (Registraduria Nacional\ndel Estado Civil -Proceso inicado.rar) as an example, the time after decryption is the same\nas the left one located in the MHTML meta data (the last modified time on the right side\nneeds to be reduced by 8 hours since we are in the UTC +8 time zone).\n\nBy comparing each last modified time of the RAR archive with the one located in the meta\ndata, we have confidence to say that the time is not spoofed. So it makes sense to\nperform related statistics of all the bait documents captured.\n\n## Statistics of the Last Modified Time\n\nAll of the last modified time from the captured bait documents are shown in the table\nbelow:\n\n**UTC+00**\n\n00:32\n\n01:15\n\n01:15\n\n01:17\n\n01:35\n\n01:59\n\n\n-----\n\n04:40\n\n04:55\n\n05:17\n\n12:27\n\n12:49\n\n12:50\n\n13:38\n\n13:42\n\n13:49\n\n14:21\n\n14:22\n\n15:19\n\n15:26\n\n15:30\n\n15:56\n\n17:22\n\n17:58\n\n18:31\n\n20:53\n\n21:31\n\n23:30\n\nFrom the above we could see that the time never distributed between 05:30 and 12:30,\nwhich supposed to be sleep hours. Combining with the fact that most of the activities are\nbetween 13:00 and 2:00, we suspect attackers are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent\nones).\n\n## PE Timestamp\n\nWe also performed statistics of timestamps in the dumped PE samples and figure out they\nare not far from the one in the bait documents:\n\n**Last Modified Time of Bait Document** **Timestamp in PE Dump**\n\n2019/2/11 17:58 2019/2/14 3:28\n\n2018/12/3 15:30 2018/12/3 23:26\n\n2018/11/26 18:31 2018/10/17 22:29\n\n2018/11/15 12:49 2018/10/17 22:29\n\n\n-----\n\n2018/10/26 13:49 2018/10/17 22:29\n\n2018/10/22 17:22 2018/10/17 22:29\n\n2018/10/12 15:56 2018/10/17 22:29\n\n2018/10/4 5:17\n\n2018/9/13 13:42 2018/8/27 22:08\n\n2018/9/9 0:32\n\n2018/9/2 20:53 2018/8/27 22:08\n\n2018/8/27 15:19 2018/8/27 22:08\n\n2018/8/6 1:35 2018/8/1 11:25\n\n2018/8/1 2:57 2018/8/1 11:25\n\n2018/7/31 1:59 2018/8/1 11:25\n\n2018/7/30 1:17 2018/8/1 11:25\n\n2018/7/26 3:28 2018/8/27 22:08\n\n2018/7/10 4:55 2018/7/11 11:47\n\n2018/6/19 21:31\n\n2018/6/14 1:15\n\n2018/6/14 1:15\n\n2018/5/29 13:38\n\n2018/5/18 14:22 2018/5/22 20:11\n\n2018/4/28 12:27 2018/5/22 20:11\n\n2018/4/25 23:30 2018/5/22 20:11\n\n2018/4/24 12:50\n\n2018/4/17 15:26 2018/5/22 20:11\n\n2018/4/6 4:40\n\n## Language and Charset\n\nWe also perform statistics on the language and charset of the bait documents (MHTML)\nand find they are created on Western European language environment (Spanish, etc.).\n\n\n-----\n\nCharset：windows-1252\n\nSome of the author information are also Spanish.\n\nCentro de Servicios Judiciales\n\n## Attacker Profile\n\nBased on the time zone of the attacker, the language being used, and the geopolitical\nfactors of the APT attack, we come up with following findings:\n\n1. The time zone (UTC -4) is related to countries in South America.\n\n2. Most of the countries in South America use Spanish (except Brazil), which matches\n\nthe attacker’s locale and user names in the bait documents.\n\n3. APT attack could probably be carried out by neighboring countries.\n\n4. The background of the victims and the duration of the attack indicate the attacker\n\nkeeps concerned with strategic-level intelligence for a long time.\n\nAbove all, 360 Threat Intelligence Center suspect the APT group probably comes from\nSouth American countries with government support.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Bait Document MD5s** **File Name**\n\n0c97d7f6a1835a3fe64c1c625ea109ed Registraduria
