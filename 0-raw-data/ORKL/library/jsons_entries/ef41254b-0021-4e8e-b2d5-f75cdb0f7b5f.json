We identified at least 12 different organizations targeted\nin this attack. These organizations include aviation, air traffic control, and government and\ndefense contractors.\n\n**_Figure 1. Spear phishing email targeting aerospace and defense industry_**\n\nIn choosing their targets, the attackers identified individuals in important roles, including\ndirectors and vice presidents. The content of all the emails were identical. The attackers\nused a report published in 2012 regarding the outlook of the aerospace and defense\nindustries as the lure. The intention of the attackers was to make it seem as though this\nemail originally came from the company that authored the report. The emails were also\ncrafted to look as though they were being forwarded by internal employees or by\nindividuals from within the industries identified.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the malicious PDF attached to the email is opened, it attempts to exploit the Adobe\nFlash Player CVE-2011-0611 'SWF' File Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE2011-0611). If successful, it drops malicious files as well as a clean PDF file to keep the\nruse going.\n\n**_Figure 2. Clean PDF file displayed to the user_**\n\nThe clean PDF file that is dropped is the industry report identified as the lure, however, it\ncuriously has been modified by the attackers to remove some branding elements.\n\nIn addition to the clean PDF file, the threat drops a malicious version of the svchost.exe\nfile. This file then drops a malicious version of ntshrui.dll into the Windows directory. The\n[threat leverages a technique known as DLL search order hijacking (the ntshrui.dll file is not](https://www.mandiant.com/blog/malware-persistence-windows-registry/)\n[protected by KnownDLLs). When the svchost.exe file calls the explorer.exe file, it will load](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/07/19/187752.aspx)\nthe malicious ntshrui.dll file in the Windows folder instead of the legitimate ntshrui.dll file in\nthe Windows system directory. Symantec detects both the svchost.exe and ntshrui.dll files\nas [Backdoor.Barkiofork.](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-042403-0432-99)\n\nThis version of Backdoor.Barikiofork has the following capabilities:\n\nEnumerates disk drives\nContacts the command-and-control (C&C) server at osamu.update.ikwb.com\nSteals system information\nDownloads and executes further updates\n\nThis spear phishing campaign continues to show the sophistication and preparation of\nattackers, especially gathering intelligence on what social engineering will best entice\ntargets.\n\nOrganizations should ensure proper email security is in place and also make patch\nmanagement a priority, as the vulnerability exploited here was patched in 2011.\n\nStatistics\n\n0 Favorited\n\n0 Views\n\n0 Files\n\n\n-----\n\n0 Shares\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
