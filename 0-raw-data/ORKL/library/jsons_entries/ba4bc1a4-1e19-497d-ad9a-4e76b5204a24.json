From an increase in enterprise-focused threats to diversification of sophisticated hacking, evasion, and stealth techniques to aggressive adware aimed at Androids, the 2019 threat\n\n**Global Windows malware** landscape was shaped by a cybercrime industry that was all\n\n**detections increased by** grown up.\n\n**13% on business endpoints**\n\nWhile Malwarebytes observed a relative plateau in the overall volume of threat\n\ndetections in 2019, our telemetry showed a clear trend toward industrialization.\n\nGlobal Windows malware detections on business endpoints increased by 13\n\npercent, and a bifurcation of attack techniques split threat categories neatly\n\nbetween those targeting consumers and those affecting organizations’\n\nnetworks. The Trojan-turned-botnets Emotet and TrickBot made a return in\n\n2019 to terrorize organizations alongside new ransomware families, such as\n\n**Rise in pre-installed**\n\nRyuk, Sodinokibi, and Phobos. In addition, a flood of hack tools and registry\n\n**malware and adware on**\n\nkey disablers made a splashy debut in our top detections, a reflection of the\n\n**Android devices**\n\ngreater sophistication used by today’s business-focused attackers.\n\nMeanwhile, the 2019 mobile threat landscape fared no better. While\n\nMalwarebytes launched a massive drive to combat stalkerware—apps that\n\nenable users to monitor their partners’ every digital move—which led to an\n\nincrease in our detections, other nefarious threats lingered on the horizon,\n\nwith increases in their detections not being helped along by our own research\n\n**For the first time ever,** efforts. We observed a rise in pre-installed malware and adware on the devices\n\n**Macs outpaced Windows** of our Android customers, with the goal to either steal data or steal attention.\n\n**PCs in number of threats**\n\nIn fact, adware reigned supreme for consumers and businesses on Windows,\n\n**detected per endpoint**\n\nMac, and Android devices, pulling ever more aggressive techniques for serving\n\n\n-----\n\nup advertisements, hijacking browsers, redirecting\n\nweb traffic, and proving stubbornly difficult to uninstall.\n\nAnd for the first time ever, Macs outpaced Windows\n\nPCs in number of threats detected per endpoint. Even\n\nexploits, malvertising, and web skimmers had a banner\n\nyear. Outside of cryptominers and leftover WannaCry\n\ninfections, it seemed there were few cybercrime tactics\n\nbeing outright abandoned or on the decline.\n\nWith an increase in impact and reach, then, came an\n\nincrease in public awareness and scrutiny. And in no area\n\n### Methodology\n\nThe State of Malware report features data sets collected\n\nfrom product telemetry, honey pots, intelligence, and\n\nother research conducted by Malwarebytes threat\n\nanalysts and reporters from January 1 through December\n\n31, 2019. Data from the previous year is used to\n\ndemonstrate year-over-year change.\n\nOur telemetry is derived from Malwarebytes customers,\n\nboth consumer and business, limited to only real-time\n\ndetections from active, professional, and premium\n\naccounts. This selection reduces outlier data that may\n\nskew trends. For example, a user installing Malwarebytes\n\nfor the first time may have hundreds or thousands of\n\n\nwas this more apparent than data privacy. On the heels\n\nof the Global Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) in Europe\n\nand several public social media failures, a tsunami of data\n\nprivacy legislation, proposals, fines, controversies, and\n\npublic policies came forward in 2019. After a decade\n\n**marked by seemingly hundreds of high-profile**\n\n**data breaches, the fallout from all that personally**\n\n**identifiable information (PII) floating around on the**\n\n**dark web finally arrived.**\n\ndetections from existing infections that weren’t actively\n\nspread during the timeframe of our study. These\n\ndetections could then muddy data on the distribution or\n\nprominence of a particular threat.\n\nIn addition, we focus on named threats rather than\n\ngeneric detections gathered by heuristics (i.e. anomalous\n\nbehavior detections), as they provide little-to-no\n\nintelligence value. To that end, the numbers presented in\n\nthis report represent a percentage of our total collected\n\ntelemetry, however, this percentage tells the most\n\naccurate story about the global threat landscape in 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n\n❱ There’s been an increasing move over the last two\n\nyears to organizations over consumers. Overall\n\nconsumer threat detections are down by 2 percent\n\nfrom 2018, but business detections increased by 13\n\npercent in 2019. This resulted in a mere 1 percent\n\nincrease in threat volume year-over-year.\n\n❱ The sophistication of threat capabilities in 2019\n\nincreased, with many using exploits, credential\nstealing tools, and multi-stage attacks involving mass\n\ninfections of a target. While seven of 10 top consumer\n\nthreat categories decreased in volume, HackTools—a\n\nthreat category for tools used to hack into systems\n\nand computers—increased against consumers by 42\n\npercent year-over-year, bolstered by families such as\n\nMimiKatz, which also targeted businesses.\n\n❱ Organizations were once again hammered with\n\nEmotet and TrickBot in 2019, two Trojan families\n\nthat started out as simple bankers/info-stealers\n\nthen evolved into downloaders and botnets. This\n\nwas reflected in global business detections, as well\n\nas regional and vertical-focused telemetry, where\n\nTrickBot and Emotet surfaced in the top five threats\n\nfor nearly every region of the globe, and in top threat\n\ndetections for the services, retail, and education\n\nindustries. Emotet was Malwarebytes’ overall\n\nsecond most-detected threat against organizations,\n\nincreasing by 6 percent over 2018. However, TrickBot’s\n\ngrowth in 2019 has been much greater than Emotet’s.\n\nAt fourth place in our top business detections,\n\nTrickBot rose by 52 percent from last year.\n\n❱ Ransomware detections have slightly declined from\n\n2018, however, this is due to a lower rate of WannaCry\n\ndetections leftover from 2017. Net new ransomware\n\nactivity against organizations remains higher than\n\nwe’ve ever seen before, with families such as Ryuk,\n\nPhobos, and Sodinokibi making waves against cities,\n\nschools, and hospitals. In fact, Ryuk detections\n\n\nincreased by 543 percent over Q4 2018, and since its\n\nintroduction in May 2019, detections of Sodinokibi\n\nhave increased by 820 percent.\n\n❱ Adware has become much more aggressive\n\nin 2019, heavily targeting consumer and\n\nbusiness endpoints on Windows, Mac,\n\nand Android devices. A new team of\n\nthe most active adware families have\n\nreplaced the top adware family\n\ndetections of 2018. In total, we saw\n\napproximately 24 million Windows\n\nadware detections and 30 million\n\nMac detections. The top three\n\nconsumer threat detections\n\nbelonged to adware families\n\nand the number one business\n\ndetection was also adware. The\n\nnumber one Mac detection, an\n\nadware family called NewTab,\n\nbrought in 28 million detections\n\nitself.\n\n❱ We saw a significant rise in the overall\n\nprevalence of Mac threats in 2019, with\n\nan increase of over 400 percent from\n\n2018. However, part of that increase can be\n\nattributed to an increase in our Malwarebytes for\n\nMac userbase. To see if that increase reflects the\n\nreality of the Mac threat landscape, we examined\n\nthreats per endpoint on both Macs and Windows PCs.\n\nIn 2019, we detected an average of 11 threats per Mac\n\nendpoint—nearly double the average of 5.8 threats\n\nper endpoint on Windows.\n\n❱ Of the four global regions, North America (NORAM)\n\nwas responsible for 48 percent of our detections, with\n\nEurope, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) in second\n\nplace at 26 percent. Latin America (LATAM) and Asia\n\nPacific (APAC) brought up the rear, with 14 and 12\n\n\n-----\n\npercent, respectively. Two regions saw decreases\n\nin overall threats: EMEA detections dropped by 2\n\npercent and APAC, outside of Australia, New Zealand,\n\nand Singapore, decreased by 11 percent. In Australia\n\nand New Zealand, the dip was more prominent at 14\n\npercent. North America was at the receiving end of\n\nmore than 24 million threats, up 10 percent from 2018.\n\nBut LATAM saw the most growth in 2019, up to 7.2\n\nmillion detections, an increase of 26 percent.\n\n❱ On the web threats front, a shift by browser\n\ndevelopers to rely more on the Chromium platform\n\ngave us concern for the discovery and development\n\nof new exploits against today and tomorrow’s browser\n\napplications, and not just for the aging and dwindling\n\nInternet Explorer. Meanwhile, web skimmer activity\n\nwas at an all-time high in 2019, with groups like\n\nMageCart aggressively modifying payment processor\n\nsites to steal financial information without the need\n\nfor malware to be installed on the endpoint.\n\n❱ Finally, data privacy was heavy on the public mind in\n\n2019, post-GDPR. Several new pieces of legislation\n\nwere passed in the United States, including laws in\n\nMaine, Nevada, and California that may serve as the\n\nbackbone for future federal regulation. In addition,\n\ntech companies such as Apple, Malwarebytes,\n\nProtonMail, and Mozilla launched privacy-forward\n\nproducts in 2019, including tracking blockers,\n\ntracking-free browsers, and encrypted calendar\n\ntools. On the flip side, many privacy blunders were\n\nmade by tech juggernauts, such as Google, Amazon,\n\nand Facebook, who shipped products with secret\n\nmicrophone features and vulnerabilities enabling\n\ncustomer data to be viewed by employees, sold\n\nuser data to third-party companies without express\n\npermission, and committed other manhandlings of\n\nuser PII. While the companies publicly pledged to do\n\nbetter on privacy, their revenue models are largely\n\ndependent on advertising dollars—meaning user data\n\nis their most valuable asset.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Windows threat landscape 2019\n\n###### Global detections 2018-2019\n\n 2018 2019\n\n Overall 50,170,502 50,510,960\n\n Business 8,498,934 9,599,305\n\n Consumer 41,671,568 40,911,655\n\nFigure 1. Total number of consumer and business detections in 2019 vs. 2018\n\n\nWelcome to 2020, stats fans! It’s time for us to observe\n\nthe 2019 threat landscape through the rearview mirror\n\nand take note of the interesting developments that\n\nhappened throughout the year. To begin, we’ll examine\n\nthe total number of business and consumer detections\n\nin 2019 compared with 2018.\n\nAccording to our product telemetry, overall detections\n\nof malware have increased year-over-year by only 1\n\npercent, from 50,170,502 to 50,510,960. However, when\n\nwe separate business and consumer detections, we can\n\n\nsee that while consumer threats declined by 2 percent,\n\nbusiness detections increased by nearly 1 million, or 13\n\npercent, from 2018 to 2019.\n\nThe volume of consumer detections still far outweighs\n\nthat of businesses, but this trend has been reversing\n\nsince 2018, when many threat actors began to shift focus\n\nto development of malware families and campaigns\n\naimed at organizations where they could profit from\n\nlarger payouts.\n\n\n### Consumer threat categories\n\n\nTo get a sense of the types of malware consumers\n\nacross the globe faced in 2019, we first looked at the\n\ntop threat categories detected on endpoints running\n\nMalwarebytes Premium.\n\nAdware is once again the dominant threat category\n\nfor consumers, as it was in 2018. Detections of adware\n\nremained steady throughout the year, with just a slight\n\n\ndip during the summer months. We expect to see\n\nadware detections holding on strong for consumers\n\nthrough 2020.\n\nTrojan activity, however, has been on the decline for\n\nconsumers for most of the year, slipping in volume by\n\n7 percent from 2018. As Trojan families such as Emotet\n\nmoved away from targeting consumers, we saw the\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Top 10 consumer category detections 2019\n\n90,000\n\n80,000\n\nTrojan\n\n70,000\n\n60,000\n\nAdware\n\n50,000\n\n40,000\n\n30,000\n\nRiskware Tool\n\n20,000\n\nTrojan\n\n10,000\n\nSpyware\nBackdoor Rogue HackTool\n\n0\n\n1-Jan-19 1-Feb-19 1-Mar-19 1-Apr-19 1-May-19 1-Jun-19 1-Jul-19 1-Aug-19 1-Sep-19 1-Oct-19 1-Nov-19 1-Dec-19\n\n\nAdware\n\nRiskware Tool\n\nTrojan\n\nHacktool\n\nCrack Tool\n\nBackdoor\n\nHijacker\n\nSpyware\n\nRogue\n\nWorm\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Trojan||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||\n|Adware||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||\n|Riskware Tool||||||||||||\n|Trojan||||||||||||\n|Spyware Backdoor Rogue HackTool||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||\n\n\nFigure 2. Top 10 consumer threat categories in 2019\n\noverall category drop as a result. In fact, the dramatic\n\nspike in Trojan detections at the beginning of the\n\nyear was due to an Emotet campaign, but we saw no\n\nother such drastic increases in Trojan activity against\n\nconsumers this year. We expect to see Trojan malware\n\ncontinue to be a problem for consumers in 2020, but\n\nless so than other threats, and especially less than in\n\nprevious years.\n\nMeanwhile, riskware (detected as RiskwareTools), which\n\ncontains most of our cryptominer detections, has\n\nbeen on a steady downward slope, with 4 million fewer\n\ndetections in 2019 than in 2018—a 35 percent decrease.\n\nIt’s been more than two years since the “CryptoRush”\n\nfirst enamored cybercriminals with dreams of striking\n\nit rich via GPU, and reality has begun to sink in. While\n\nfluctuations of both cryptocurrency value and spikes\n\nof miner detections are common, threat actors are\n\nrecognizing that the return on investment opportunities\n\nfor cryptomining have mostly dried up—for now.\n\nWhile the decline in riskware is one of the most\n\nstatistically significant decreases (alongside a steep\n\n\n73 percent dive in hijacker detections), it follows the\n\nsame pattern as seven of the top 10 consumer threat\n\ncategories: diminishing importance. Cybercriminals\n\nare losing interest in consumer targets, at least by way\n\nof the usual threat suspects. Trojans, cryptominers,\n\nransomware, hijackers, backdoors, worms, and more\n\nare either being reserved for organizations or ditched\n\naltogether.\n\nOn the flip side, one threat category saw a surge in\n\n2019 consumer detections: hack tools (detected as\n\n[HackTools). Increasing by 42 percent over 2018, hack](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/hacktool/)\n\ntools moved up in the rankings from fifth to fourth place\n\nwith nearly 1 million more detections. Hack tools are a\n\ncategory of threats that are frequently used for hacking\n\ninto a computer or network. These tools may not be\n\nmalicious themselves, but they are capable of additional\n\nintrusion, data collection, and dropping other malware\n\npayloads. The sharp increase in hack tools detections\n\non consumer endpoints is concerning, and we’ll be\n\nkeeping a close watch on this category in early 2020 and\n\nbeyond.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Top 10 consumer threat category rankings\n\n### Business threat categories\n\n\nMoving on to telemetry gathered from organizations\n\nrunning Malwarebytes business products, we saw\n\na greater amount of diversity in threat types and\n\ndistribution than on the consumer side.\n\nWhile normally a constant thorn in the side of\n\nconsumers, adware detections spiked for organizations\n\nduring the first half of the year, dropping to a\n\nmanageable level by early summer. Adware was thrown\n\nout of the top spot at various periods of the year by\n\n\nTrojans, backdoors, and riskware, but remained our\n\nnumber one threat category for businesses overall,\n\nincreasing by 463 percent over its 2018 levels.\n\nTrojan malware, meanwhile, slipped to the second\nhighest category of business detections in 2019,\n\ndethroned from its first-place ranking in 2018. Trojan\n\nthreats decreased by 25 percent this year, dropping\n\nsignificantly in May and never recovering to its Q1\n\nand Q2 levels. Despite this dip, we still saw 2.8 million\n\ndetections of Trojan malware in 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Top 10 business category detections 2018-2019\n\n30,000\n\nAdware\n\n25,000\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\nTrojan\n\n10,000\n\nAdware\nRiskware Tool\n\nBackdoor Backdoor\n\n5,000\n\nRansom Rogue\nSpyware\n\n0\n\n30-Dec-18 30-Jan-19 28-Feb-19 31-Mar-19 30-Apr-19 31-May-19 30Jun-19 31-Jul-19 31-Aug-19 30-Sep-19 31-Oct-19 30-Nov-19\n\n\nTrojan\n\nAdware\n\nHijacker\n\nRiskwareTool\n\nBackdoor\n\nSpyware\n\nRansom\n\nWorm\n\nHackTool\n\nRogue\n\nHackTool\n\n|Adware|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||\n|Trojan||||||||||||\n|Adware Riskware Tool Backdoor Backdoor||||||||||||\n|Ransom Rogue Spyware||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||\n\n\nFigure 4. Top 10 business threat categories in 2019\n\nWe’ve observed a heavy volume of backdoor malware\n\naimed at organizations over the years, thanks to families\n\nlike Vools. This year, backdoor detections increased by 14\n\npercent for organizations. However, the rate of infection\n\ndeclined throughout 2019, starting off the year stronger\n\nthan ending it.\n\nMeanwhile, riskware detections on business endpoints\n\nincreased by 52 percent this year, a striking difference\n\nfrom the 35 percent decline on the consumer side. This\n\ntells us that threat actors are trying to squeeze the last\n\njuice out of the crypto-lemon, looking for higher returns\n\non investment by targeting businesses with fatter crypto\n\nwallets or more endpoints to generate CPU.\n\nThe 224 percent increase in hack tools detections\n\nreinforces what we already know about an attack vector\n\ngaining in popularity with cybercriminals—the manual\n\ninfection of business networks through misconfigured\n\nports or unpatched vulnerabilities. There are also many\n\nfamilies of malware, like Mimikatz, that use hacker tools\n\nas part of their regular operations, and this probably\n\n\ncontributed to the category’s rise through the rankings\n\nfrom position 10 in 2018 to 7 in 2019. In fact, business\n\ndetections of hack tools more than tripled in number this\n\nyear. Combining both consumer and business data, there\n\nwere over 1 million more hack tools detections in 2019\n\nthan in 2018. It’s clear this threat category meant business.\n\nAnd then there’s the omnipresent ransomware. Despite\n\nbeing dwarfed by other threat categories in volume,\n\nransomware detections in 2019 were both noticeable\n\nand concerning. Many of the most high-profile\n\ncyberattacks of the year involved ransomware, so we’re\n\nnone too surprised to see it poking its head through\n\nthe pile of adware and Trojan detections. Year-over\nyear volume of ransomware detections declined by 6\n\npercent, but the numbers don’t tell the full story. The\n\nransomware families most popular with threat actors in\n\n2019 were far more advanced than what we saw in 2018\n\nand the years before.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Top 10 business threat category rankings\n\n### Consumer threat families\n\n\nSwitching gears to discuss specific families of malware,\n\nwhich live under the umbrella of threat categories,\n\nwe have identifed the top 10 families that plagued\n\nconsumers over the last year.\n\nMuch of the top threats dealt with by consumers\n\nin 2019 were some form of adware. Adware is the\n\nperfect type of threat to attack a consumer. Rather than\n\ninvesting in sophisticated forms of malware that can\n\ninfiltrate entire networks or ransom files, cybercriminals\n\nchoose inexpensive adware to assist in social\n\nengineering tricks, technical support scams, page\n\nredirections, or system hijacks meant to sell something\n\n\nto users, inflate views of ads, or scam people out of\n\ntheir money.\n\nAdware families took seven of the top 10 spots, with\n\nSearchEncrypt, IronCore, FusionCore, CrossRider,\n\nand Spigot joining the list for the first time in 2019.\n\nMindspark and InstallCore are two adware mainstays\n\nthat experienced 497 and 367 percent increases in 2019,\n\nrespectively. SearchEncrypt saw an astounding 1,730\n\npercent increase year-over-year. Even if the family didn’t\n\nmake our top 10 for global consumer detections, many\n\nother adware families are living large in specific regions\n\nand against businesses.\n\n\n-----\n\nOther notable changes include a 375 percent increase\n\nof Emotet infections in 2019, which is likely due to an\n\nespecially active campaign launched at the beginning of\n\n###### Threat family\n\n 1 Adware.MindSpark\n\n 2 Adware.InstallCore\n\n 3 Adware.SearchEncrypt\n\n 4 RiskWare.BitCoinminer\n\n 5 Trojan.Emotet\n\n 6 Adware.IronCore\n\n 7 HackTool.FilePatch\n\n 8 Adware.FusionCore\n\n 9 Adware.Crossrider\n\n 10 Adware.Spigot\n\nFigure 6. Top 10 consumer threat family rankings\n\n\nthe year. In addition, BitCoinMiner detections dropped\n\nby 46 percent, which follows the slow decline of the\n\nriskware category we witnessed throughout the year.\n\n\n### Business threat families\n\n\nBusiness endpoints running Malwarebytes in 2019\n\ndetected and blocked an enormous number of threats,\n\nwith several new families observed in the top 10\n\nranking—more than half of which experienced triple\n\ndigit percentage increases in 2019. In fact, every single\n\nbusiness threat family listed in the top 10 experienced\n\ngrowth this year, with the exception of a single family.\n\n\nWhile the adware family Yontoo dropped out of\n\nconsumer rankings this year, it’s now the top threat\n\nlodged against businesses, increasing by more than\n\n6,000 percent year-over-year—a clear sign that the\n\nthreat actors pushing this family have an interest in\n\nbusiness victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Top 10 business threat family rankings\n\nWe saw the ever-popular Trojan Emotet land in our\n\nnumber two spot, having increased by a marginal\n\n6 percent. Bringing up the rear as our fourth most\ndetected business threat family is TrickBot, another\n\ndangerous Trojan that experienced a 52 percent incline\n\nover the previous year. In 2018, TrickBot was most\n\noften seen pairing with other malware families, such as\n\nEmotet, acting as a secondary payload. In 2019, however,\n\nwe saw a near steady flow of TrickBot detections,\n\nregardless if Emotet was active or not.\n\nA fascinating and alarming family that made our top 10\n\nbusiness threats this year is the malware we detect as\n\nTrojan.BrowserAssistant.PowerShell. We observed over\n\n100,000 instances of this threat, which is a massive\n\n\namount for a detection that didn’t even exist in 2018.\n\nWhile known for pushing advertisements to users’\n\nbrowsers by injecting code, we can easily see this same\n\nmethod of infection being used to redirect users to\n\ndrive-by exploits or phishing pages.\n\nFinally, at number 9 on our list is the backdoor known\n\nas QBot or QakBot, a lesser known but nonetheless\n\ndangerous threat that increased by 465 percent this\n\nyear. QBot has historically been known as a banking\n\nTrojan, meaning that it steals financial data from\n\nsystems, but it has also been seen using PowerShell\n\nscripts to summon credential theft tools like Mimikatz to\n\nself-propagate.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Family deep dive\n\nWhile we have seen a wide variety of threats throughout\n\n2019, these next five families have had a significant\n\nimpact on the Windows threat landscape. First, we’ll talk\n\nabout some old buddies of ours, Emotet and TrickBot.\n\nAfter a quick check-in with those chuckleheads, we’ll\n\ndelve into two ransomware families making waves: Ryuk\n\nand Sodinokibi. Finally, we’ll take a look at a little-known\n\nbut fairly crafty threat: a hijacker called SecurityRun.\n\n30,000\n\n25,000\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\n0\n\n31-Mar-19 30-Apr-19 31-May-19 30-Jun-19\n\nFigure 8. Emotet in the second half of 2019\n\nIn 2019, we observed an overall increase of 73 percent\n\nin Emotet detections (between both consumer and\n\nbusiness customers), much of it coming from a massive\n\ncampaign in early 2019. Figure 8 expresses the trend\n\nin Emotet detections from April to the end of the year,\n\nspecifically so we can observe what happened after\n\nEmotet “went back to sleep” over the summer.\n\nAs we expected, Emotet picked back up its campaigns\n\nin the fall, targeting businesses over consumers and\n\ncreating a niche for themselves in selling secondary\n\n\n##### Emotet\n\nNearly every report we’ve released over the last two\n\nyears has mentioned the notorious Emotet Trojan.\n\nAs much as it would be nice to say, “We’re just fans,”\n\nthe reality is that we can’t seem to get away from this\n\nmalware family.\n\nConsumer\n\nBusiness\n\n31-Aug-19 31-Oct-19 30-Nov-19\n\npayload access to other criminals through their existing\n\ninfections. The motivation of the actors behind Emotet\n\nseems to be expansion of their botnet and offerings to\n\nother threat actors.\n\nEmotet seems to focus on Western countries as its\n\nprimary target, however we’ve seen increases in Emotet\n\ndetections all over the world in 2019, from Singapore to\n\nthe United Arab Emirates to Mexico.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Emotet’s top 10 national targets\n\nDistribution of Emotet relies on malicious phishing\n\nemails spread by the malware and its controllers. In 2019,\n\nwe observed campaigns pushing Emotet that used\n\nthe names of controversial public figures to ensnare\n\nusers into opening emails and malicious attachments.\n\nFor example, Emotet was the “prize” for opening up\n\nattachments from the following phishes:\n\n❱ [Emails claiming they had Edward Snowden’s new](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/botnets/2019/09/emotet-malspam-campaign-uses-snowdens-new-book-as-lure/)\n\n[book, Permanent Record, as a Word attachment](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/botnets/2019/09/emotet-malspam-campaign-uses-snowdens-new-book-as-lure/)\n\n❱ Emails with Word attachments urging users to\n\n“support Greta Thunberg,” Time Magazine’s Person of\n\nthe Year\n\nIn addition, we saw Emotet emails delivered in a variety\n\nof languages, including English, Italian, Spanish, German,\n\nand French.\n\nAs you may remember, one of the capabilities of Emotet\n\nincludes establishing an affected system as a spam\n\nsender. The malware scrapes the users’ contacts and\n\n\nsends out malspam similar to the phishes mentioned\n\nhere, but further disguised as coming from the infected\n\nuser.\n\nCombine its spam module functions with frequently\nseen secondary payloads of families that can move\n\nlaterally throughout a network, such as Trickbot or QBot,\n\nand you’ve got the perfect toolkit for infecting an entire\n\ncorporate network.\n\n##### TrickBot\n\nSpeak of the devil. While mostly associated as a\n\nsecondary payload for Emotet in the second half of 2018,\n\nTrickBot had a steady amount of detections throughout\n\n2019, thanks in part to its own infection efforts.\n\nIn 2019, TrickBot was spread in multiple ways, including\n\nas a secondary payload, via connected, infected\n\nsystems (typically, a corporate network), or through\n\ngood old-fashioned phishing. To get into a corporate\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10.

In addition, TrickBot added a new\n\nfeature to defeat multi-factor authentication, as well as\n\nits own spam module called TrickBooster, which was\n\nfound to have compromised over 250 million accounts.\n\nIn 2019, we’ve observed TrickBot phishing emails\n\ndisguised as:\n\n❱ Scanned documents from a Xerox printer\n\n❱ Legislation on tax bills\n\n❱ Harassment complaints\n\nOnce on the network, besides stealing personally\n\nidentifiable information from organizations and\n\nindividuals, TrickBot was observed attempting to steal\n\ntax documents so the actors behind the malware could\n\nfile fraudulent returns.\n\n\nTrickBot’s distribution is slightly more varied and\n\nwidespread than that of Emotet, though the US and UK\n\nare still its top targets. The actors behind this family have\n\nmade existing infections of TrickBot available to nation\nstate actors, as well as to other cybercriminals.\n\nWe find it interesting that both TrickBot and Emotet\n\nevolved from being regular banking Trojans to first-stage\n\ninfection vendors and botnets. As much we we’d like to\n\nbid farewell to both of these families, our guess is we’ll\n\nbe seeing them again in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. TrickBot national targets in 2019\n\n##### Ryuk\n\nThese next two ransomware families didn’t pull down the\n\nsame numbers as their Trojan brothers, but the damage\n\nthey caused made their impact in 2019 monumental.\n\nThe days of seeing massive, year-long ransomware\n\ncampaigns are over. Instead, ransomware attacks this\n\nyear relied on more covert and specialized infection\n\nmethods, such as existing infections of Emotet or\n\nTrickBot, to make their presence known.\n\nRansomware operations in 2019 haven’t so much slowed\n\ndown as their targeting has become more precise.\n\nInstead of spraying a wide cross-section of potential\n\nvictims, ransomware authors sniped the most vulnerable\n\nrich targets they could find.\n\nWe’ll start the story with Ryuk. First discovered in mid\nAugust 2018, Ryuk immediately turned heads after\n\n[disrupting operations of Tribune Publishing newspapers](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/malware/2019/01/ryuk-ransomware-attacks-businesses-over-the-holidays/)\n\nover the Christmas holiday heading into 2019. It was\n\nquarantined eventually; however, Ryuk re-infected and\n\nspread onto connected systems in the network because\n\n\nthe security patches failed to hold when tech teams\n\nbrought the servers back. Detections of Ryuk increased\n\nby more than 500 percent in Q1 2019 over the previous\n\nquarter, and by Q4 2019, they were up another 43\n\npercent.\n\n[There was a time when Ryuk ransomware arrived on](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2019/12/threat-spotlight-the-curious-case-of-ryuk-ransomware/)\n\nclean systems to wreak havoc. But most strains observed\n\nin 2019, especially in the second half of the year,\n\nbelonged to multi-attack campaigns involving Emotet\n\nand TrickBot. As such, Ryuk variants arrive on systems\n\npre-infected with other malware—a “triple threat” attack\n\nmethodology. Once threat actors confirm the systems\n\nthey’ve infected with Emotet and TrickBot are in the\n\ncorrect sector, and that they’ve reached endpoints on\n\nwhich valuable assets are stored, they check for and\n\nestablish a connection with the target’s live servers via\n\nremote desktop protocol (RDP). From there, they drop\n\nRyuk.\n\nRyuk had been seen targeting various enterprise\n\norganizations worldwide in 2019, asking ransom\n\npayments ranging from 15 to 50 Bitcoins (BTC), which\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Ryuk detections on business endpoints in 2019\n\ntranslates to between US$97,000 and $320,000 at\n\ntime of valuation. This method of exclusively targeting\n\nlarge organizations with critical assets for a high ROI is\n\ncalled “big game hunting.” To date, Ryuk ransomware\n\nis hailed as the costliest among its peers. According to\n\n[a report by Coveware, Ryuk’s asking price is 10 times](https://www.coveware.com/blog/2019/2/19/ryuk-ransomware-exploring-the-technical-and-human-connections)\n\nthe average, though they claim that their ransoms are\n\nhighly negotiable. The varying ways adversaries work\n\nout ransom payments suggests that there may be more\n\nthan one criminal group behind Ryuk ransomware.\n\nAs detections spiked heading into 2020, we realized\n\nwe’d be seeing more of this dangerous and expensive\n\nransomware in the year to come.\n\n##### Sodinokibi\n\n[Sodinokibi is a ransomware-as-a-service threat model](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2019/07/threat-spotlight-sodinokibi-ransomware-attempts-to-fill-gandcrab-void/)\n\nthat first appeared on the scene in May 2019, curiously\n\ncongruent with the time that the infamous GandCrab’s\n\nauthors publicly called it quits. Our telemetry lends\n\nweight to the theories that Sodinokibi is actually run by\n\nGandCrab’s authors, who many researchers say simply\n\ntweaked some of GandCrab’s old features, gave it a new\n\n\nname, and found new “affiliates” for distribution. Looking\n\nat the downturn in GandCrab detections at the end of\n\nMay and subsequent spike in Sodinokibi detections in\n\nJune, we’d be hard-pressed to argue otherwise.\n\nSodinokibi attack methods include:\n\n❱ Active exploitation of a vulnerability in Oracle\n\nWebLogic, officially named CVE-2019-2725\n\n❱ Malicious spam or phishing campaigns with links or\n\nattachments\n\n❱ Malvertising campaigns that lead to the RIG exploit\n\nkit, an avenue that GandCrab used before\n\n❱ Compromised or infiltrated managed service\n\nproviders (MSPs) to push the ransomware en-masse.\n\nThis is done by accessing networks via a remote\n\ndesktop protocol (RDP) and then using the MSP\n\nconsole to deploy the ransomware.\n\n❱ Evading detection through the “Heaven’s Gate”\n\ntechnique used to execute 64-bit code on a 32-bit\n\nprocess, which allows malware to run\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Sodinokibi spikes as GandCrab makes its exit\n\nAlthough affiliates used many of these tactics to push\n\nGandCrab, many cybercriminals—nation-state actors\n\nincluded—have done the same to run their own malware\n\ncampaigns.\n\nSodinokibi has shown to be nearly as much of a threat as\n\nRyuk, with high spikes of detections that outweigh what\n\n1,600\n\n1,400\n\n1,200\n\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\nJan. 19 Feb. 19 Mar. 19 April. 19 May 19 June 19\n\nFigure 14. Detections of Sodinokibi on business endpoints in 2019\n\n\nwe’ve seen with other business-focused ransomware\n\n[families in 2019, such as Phobos or SamSam. Since its](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2020/01/threat-spotlight-phobos-ransomware-lives-up-to-its-name/)\n\nintroduction, detections of this family have increased by\n\n820 percent, a foreboding number as we look ahead.\n\nWe’ll likely see both Ryuk and Sodinokibi as the primary\n\nfamilies being distributed in the first half of 2020,\n\nheralding back to the days of Cerber and Locky.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### SecurityRun\n\nIn a world where malware doesn’t merely exist to infect,\n\nbut to disable security tools, it’s no surprise we’ve seen\n\nan increase of threats attempting to do the latter in 2019.\n\nOne of these threats is a hijacker known as SecurityRun.\n\nThis detection is simple: There is a registry key in your\n\nsystem that can be set to prevent certain applications\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n0\n\n6-Jan-19 6-Feb-19 6-Mar-19 6-April-19 6-May-19 6-June-19\n\nConsumer\n\nFigure 15. SecurityRun global detections in 2019\n\nfrom running, including security software. If our product\n\nidentifies one of these modifications and it wasn’t made\n\nby the user, that means there’s a high probability that\n\nthe software disabling it doesn’t want you running your\n\nsecurity tools. Any program quietly disconnecting your\n\nsecurity services without your knowledge is likely up to\n\nno good.\n\nThe registry key altered in this attack is:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\\n\nWindows\\safer\\codeidentifiers\\0\\Paths\n\n\nWe thought it prudent to highlight this threat because\n\nit was able to achieve such high distribution almost\n\nexclusively against business victims.\n\nAnother interesting note about this threat: is It’s\n\noverwhelmingly found in the United Kingdom.\n\n6-July-19 6-Aug-19 6-Sept-19 6-Oct-19 6-Nov-19 6-Dec-19\n\nBusiness\n\nHowever, we started seeing an increase in US detections\n\nover the UK at the end of October 2019, meaning this\n\nthreat may soon turn its focus westward. Regardless of\n\nthe target, these modifications can be made manually\n\nby an attacker or automatically by malware, and their\n\ndiscovery should raise some alarms. Best to treat any\n\nsystem with SecurityRun detections as though it’s likely\n\nbeen infected, and conduct further investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16.

SecurityRun switched targets by October 2019 to the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Windows threats summary\n\n\nAs we examine the trends for Windows users in 2019 and\n\nlook ahead to 2020, we see that the threat landscape\n\nis becoming increasingly divided between consumer\n\nand business targets. The major malware threat for\n\nconsumers on the horizon will be new and more\n\nintrusive forms of adware. As the primary pusher of\n\nconsumer threats in 2019, adware creators in 2020 will\n\ncount on a more relaxed stance from security providers\n\non detecting threats seen as “diet malware” to continue\n\nexploiting humans for their attention, their individual\n\nsystems, and some of their personal information.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, however, we’re seeing much\n\nmore diverse malware coming out of the woodwork,\n\nnot just Emotet and TrickBot, but QBot, SecurityRun,\n\nand numerous ransomware families, including Ryuk,\n\nSodinokibi, and Phobos, which have caused significant\n\ndisruption across the world in 2019. Greater detections\n\nof threats such as SecurityRun or hacking tools like\n\nMimikatz show that criminals are doing as much as\n\nthey can to attack organizations from all angles, using\n\ncode and tools made available to penetration testers\n\nand network administrators to not only infiltrate our\n\nspace and steal our data, but become more and more\n\nproficient at hiding from us.\n\nAs detections on organizations ramp up and\n\ncybercriminals become more adept at targeting high\n\nROI victims, we expect to see even more diversification\n\nand sophistication in 2020 for global Windows business\nfocused malware.\n\n\nBut that’s a lot of racket for only a 1 percent increase in\n\noverall malware detections, no? Considering that we’re\n\ncoming down from a cryptocurrency craze, which had\n\ncovered almost the entire threat landscape in miners,\n\nand are dispatching of errant WannaCry detections\n\nwandering the net, that 1 percent actually reflects a\n\nhealthy and growing cybercrime industry. Drastic drops\n\nin consumer detections and reasonable increases in\n\nbusiness detections mean that we may continue to\n\nsee overall malware volume decline. However, the\n\nfinancial and operational impact of businesses losing\n\nmillions, insurance prices spiking, cities and schools\n\nhalting because of ransomware attacks, and critical\n\ninfrastructure being exposed and targeted may make it\n\nfeel as though the Windows threat landscape has indeed\n\nbecome much harsher.\n\nPerhaps the grass is greener, then, on the Mac side? If\n\nonly.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mac threat landscape 2019\n\n\nWe saw a significant rise in the overall prevalence of Mac\n\nthreats in 2019, with an increase of over 400 percent\n\nfrom 2018. However, since you could argue—validly—that\n\npart of this was due to a corresponding increase in the\n\ntotal number of Mac endpoints running Malwarebytes\n\nsoftware, it’s more interesting to look at the change in\n\nthe number of detections per endpoint. Mac detections\n\nper endpoint increased from 4.8 in 2018 to a whopping\n\n11.0 in 2019, a figure that is nearly double the same\n\nstatistic for Windows.\n\nThis means that the average number of threats detected\n\non a Mac is not only on the rise, but has surpassed\n\n11.0\n\n8.3\n\n5.5\n\n###### 5.8\n\n2.8\n\n0.0\n\nWindows - 2019\n\nFigure 18. Mac threats per endpoint vs. Windows threats per endpoint\n\n\n[Windows—by a great deal. This is likely because, with](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide)\n\n[increasing market share in 2019, Macs became more](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide)\n\nattractive targets to cybercriminals. In addition, macOS’\n\nbuilt-in security systems have not cracked down on\n\nadware and PUPs to the same degree that they have\n\nmalware, leaving the door open for these borderline\n\nprograms to infiltrate.\n\nFurther, for the first time ever, Mac threats appeared\n\nat the top of Malwarebytes’ overall threat detections.\n\nTwo Mac threats—NewTab and PCVARK—showed up in\n\nsecond and third place in our list of the most prevalent\n\ndetections across all platforms.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Top Mac threats\n\nMacs differ drastically from Windows in terms of the\n\ntypes of threats seen. Where we found several different\n\ncategories and families in our top detections of Windows\n\nthreats that classify as traditional malware, especially\n\nthose aimed at businesses, most Mac threats, and\n\ncertainly the most prevalent ones of 2019, are families\n\nof adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).\n\nThe most common Mac malware family, OSX.Generic.\n\nSuspicious, fell well down the list at 30th place in Mac\nspecific detections, and hundreds of spots down on a\n\ncross-platform threat list.\n\nAmong the top 10 Mac threats (for both consumers and\n\nbusinesses) are a mix of PUPs and adware. The PUPs\n\nare a variety of mostly “cleaning” apps that have been\n\ndetermined as unwanted not just by Malwarebytes, but\n\n\nby the Mac user community at large. PUPs MacKeeper\n\nand MacBooster, previously first and third on the list in\n\n2018, fell to third and fifth place in 2019. This is likely due\n\nto the reliance of the companies behind these PUPs on a\n\nsingle app, each with a known bad reputation in the Mac\n\ncommunity.\n\nIn contrast, the PCVARK and JDI PUPs have seen a\n\nrise in 2019 to second and fourth place, with PCVARK\n\ntaking third place on cross-platform detections. In 2018,\n\nPCVARK was only at 31st place on the list, and JDI was\n\nranked sixth. These detections flag a number of different\n\n“cloned” apps, which provide identical functionality\n\nunder different names. It is likely this strategy of\n\nspreading wide under many different names that had\n\nlaunched these apps to the top of our detections.\n\n\n1 We define “traditional malware” as malicious software such as backdoors, Trojans, and spyware. As mentioned previously, adware is often considered\n“malware light,” as it can run the gamut from legitimate, advertising-supported software to malicious code.\n\n###### Top Mac detections 2019\n\nAdware.NewTab\n\nPUP.PCVARK\n\nPUP.MacKeeper\n\nPUP.JDI\n\nPUP.MacBooster\n\nOSX.Genieo\n\nPUP.Kromtech\n\nPUP.TuneupMyMac\n\nPUP.MacReviver\n\nAdware.OperatorMac\n\nOSX.VSearch\n\nPUP.MegaBackup\n\nAdware.Mindspark\n\nAdware.Crossrider\n\nAdware.Conduit\n\n0M 7.5M 15M 22.5M 30M\n\nFigure 19.

While that’s not true for a\n\ncouple adware families that topped our list of Mac threats,\n\nit’s certainly the case for Mac malware detections. The\n\ntop two Mac malware detections, with healthy numbers\n\nFigure 20. NewTab as a fake package tracker\n\n##### NewTab\n\n[NewTab, at the top of the list, only appeared on the](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/adware-newtab/)\n\nscene in December 2018, but rapidly rose to the top of\n\nour detections in 2019. NewTab is an adware family that\n\nattempts to redirect searches in the web browser for the\n\npurpose of earning illicit affiliate revenue, and it is mostly\n\ndelivered in the form of apps with embedded Safari\n\nextensions.\n\n\nexceeding 300,000, are still dwarfed by the number\n\none overall Mac detection, the adware NewTab, which\n\nwas detected nearly 30 million times in 2019. Let’s take a\n\ncloser look at some of the Mac families that dominated or\n\ndisrupted the threat landscape this year.\n\nNewTab apps are often spread through fake flight or\n\npackage tracking pages, fake maps, or fake directions\n\npages. In one early example, a fake package tracking\n\npage would accept any number entered, and\n\nregardless of the number, clicking the Track button\n\nwould download a “PackagesTracker” app, with some\n\ninstructions on how to open it. The app did not actually\n\nprovide any tracking functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Genieo\n\nGenieo is another interesting piece of adware, crossing\n\nthe line into malware due to some installation methods\n\nthat abuse system vulnerabilities. It’s one of the oldest\n\npieces of adware in the Mac world—the only threat of\n\nits magnitude to operate successfully on the Mac since\n\n2013. In 2019, our detections of Genieo reached nearly 7\n\nmillion, placing it as our sixth most-detected Mac threat\n\nof the year.\n\n[Genieo has undergone fairly frequent changes since its](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/osx-genieo/)\n\nintroduction in 2013. The adware aims to earn affiliate\n\nFigure 21. A web page serving up Genieo\n\n\nrevenue from redirected searches and home pages,\n\nand operates under hundreds of different names, often\n\nrunning from pages linked to that name that have a\n\ndistinctive and consistent look (with only graphics and\n\nminor wording changes). Users affected with Genieo will\n\nfind their search engines replaced and browser hijacked,\n\nwith sponsored results served up to help the adware\n\nauthors cash in. Uninstalling Genieo can also be difficult,\n\npushing this adware further into aggressive, malware-like\n\nmodality.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### OSX.Generic.Suspicious\n\nWhen it comes to traditional Mac malware, such as\n\nbackdoors, cryptominers, and spyware, the list is topped\n\nin 2019 by a group of files exhibiting similar malicious\n\nOSX.Generic.Suspicious\n\nOSX.FakeFileOpener\n\nOSX.FakeAV\n\nOSX.BirdMiner\n\n0K 100K\n\nFigure 22. Top Mac malware detections of 2019\n\nThe OSX.Generic.Suspicious group of detections all\n\nexhibit known bad behaviors that no legitimate software\n\n<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>\n\n\n[behavior, detected with a generic moniker: OSX.Generic.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/osx-generic-suspicious/)\n\n[Suspicious.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/osx-generic-suspicious/)\n\n200K 300K 400K\n\nprogram would engage in. For example, consider the\n\nfollowing launch agent .plist:\n\n\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC “-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN” “http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList\n1.0.dtd”>\n\n<plist version=”1.0”>\n\n<dict>\n\n<key>Label</key>\n\n<string>com.xpnsec.escape</string>\n\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n\n<array>\n\n<string>python</string>\n\n<string>-c</string>\n\n<string>import sys,base64,warnings;warnings.filterwarnings(‘ignore’);exec(base64.\n\nb64decode(‘aW1…pKQ==’));</string>\n\n</array>\n\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n\n<true/>\n\n</dict>\n\n</plist>\n\n\nThere’s no reason for legitimate software to decode\n\nbase64-encoded data and then execute it, especially\n\nwithin a launch agent .plist file. This is classic malware\n\n\nbehavior, and it would trigger our OSX.Generic.\n\nSuspicious detection criteria.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have seen a rise in this behavior over the past couple\n\nyears, and expect to see that trend continue in 2020\n\nas Apple tightens the requirements and conditions for\n\nchecking, code signing, and notarization. Since shell\n\nscripts are exempt from these restrictions, we expect to\n\nsee them used more and more by malware.\n\n##### FakeFileOpener\n\n[FakeFileOpener is another interesting piece of malware,](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/osx-fakefileopener/)\n\ndesigned to abuse and imitate legitimate macOS\n\n\nfunctionality to direct users to scam websites. This\n\nrevolves around what happens when the user opens\n\na file that no app on the system knows how to open.\n\nNormally, macOS will offer to search the App Store for\n\nyou. When the FakeFileOpener malware is installed,\n\nthe user is instead redirected to a page that indicates\n\nthey may be infected with malware, offering malicious\n\ndownloads to remedy the situation (ironic).\n\nThese apps have been circulating since 2016 and show\n\nno signs of stopping.\n\n\nFigure 23. A message from FakeFileOpener urging users to (unbeknownst to them) download more malicious apps\n\n### iOS\n\n\nOn the iOS side, malware exists, but there’s no way to\n\nscan for it. Most iOS malware is nation-state malware,\n\nspread via targeted attacks through iOS vulnerabilities,\n\nsuch as NSO’s Pegasus spyware. It was learned this year\n\n\nthat China had gotten in on the action as well, using iOS\n\nzero-days to infect phones in a targeted attack against\n\nthe Uyghur people.\n\nAlso found this year was an unprecedented zero-day\n\n\n-----\n\nvulnerability in the bootrom of iPhones ranging from\n\nthe iPhone 4S up to the iPhone X, as well as a number\n\nof other iOS, watchOS, and tvOS devices. The presence\n\nof this bug in the bootrom meant that it could not be\n\npatched; the only way to fix the bug was to buy a new\n\n[phone. Dubbed checkm8, this vulnerability was soon](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/mac/2019/09/new-ios-exploit-checkm8-allows-permanent-compromise-of-iphones/)\n\nleveraged to create the checkra1n jailbreak, capable of\n\n### Mac threat summary\n\nOf all the threats seen this year, only one incident\n\ninvolved anything other than tricking the user into\n\ndownloading and opening something they shouldn’t.\n\nThat is the incident in which Coinbase, and several\n\nother cryptocurrency companies, were targeted with\n\nmalware that infected systems through a Firefox zero\nday vulnerability. Affected systems were infected with\n\nthe older Wirenet and Mokes malware. This was the first\n\ntime such a vulnerability had been used to infect Macs in\n\nany significant way since 2012, when Java vulnerabilities\n\nwere used repeatedly to infect Macs (until Apple ripped\n\nJava out of the system, ending the threats).\n\nBeyond that what we saw was a virtual landslide of\n\nadware and PUP detections, far outpacing growth on the\n\nWindows side. While these threats are not considered\n\nas dangerous as traditional malware, they are becoming\n\n\njailbreaking many devices regardless of what version of\n\niOS they were running.\n\nAlthough initially feared, checkm8 turned out to be\n\nnot much of a problem for iPhone users, and more of a\n\nboon for iOS security researchers, who suddenly had a\n\npowerful tool they could use to analyze any recent iOS\n\nsystem and most iPhone hardware.\n\na much larger and more noticeable nuisance for Mac\n\nusers, who can no longer say that their beloved systems\n\nare immune from malware. And despite the relative\n\nlow-grade hassle from adware compared to that of, say,\n\nransomware, these families are becoming more and\n\nmore aggressive, displaying malicious and persistent\n\nbehaviors to trick users into a false sense of security.\n\nMeanwhile, straight-forward malicious behavior from\n\nMac files is increasing year-over-year, with more\n\ndeceptive techniques to evade Apple’s rather stringent\n\neye. And breakthroughs on the iOS side may have the\n\ntech behemoth reconsidering whether they should\n\nallow antivirus products on their beloved mobile\n\ndevices. If 2019’s threat landscape tells us anything, it’s\n\nthat it’s time to take a good hard look at Mac security\n\nand finally get serious.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Android threat landscape 2019\n\n\nMere stats cannot fully explain the threat landscape for\n\nAndroid users in 2019. Although numbers help guide our\n\nconclusions, it takes an extra level of expertise to get\n\nthe true lay of the land. By digging through the highest\ndetected categories and families of Android malware,\n\nwe can determine how many Malwarebytes users were\n\n### Pre-installed malware\n\nPre-installed malware. Sounds like a fallacy, doesn’t it?\n\nHow could manufacturers ship devices pre-installed\n\nwith malicious apps? Unfortunately, it’s a reality, and\n\none that’s becoming a growing problem. Although still\n\nconcentrated on budget manufacturers’ devices, such as\n\n[the US-funded UMX mobile phone that shipped with pre-](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/android/2020/01/united-states-government-funded-phones-come-pre-installed-with-unremovable-malware/)\n\ninstalled, unremovable Trojan malware, these malicious\n\napps are starting to trick big name brands as well.\n\nAt the height of the conflict is a well-known PUP we\n\n\naffected by which threats. However, some threats made\n\na massive impact without having to infect such a wide\n\nswath of devices. In the following sections, we take a\n\nlook at some of the most influential malware categories\n\nand families of the 2019 Android threat landscape.\n\n[detect as Android/PUP.Riskware.Autoins.Fota, a variant of](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/android-pup-riskware-autoins-fota/)\n\n[Adups. Adups is malicious app is found on China-made](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/12/mobile-menace-monday-upping-the-ante-on-adups-fwupgradeprovider/)\n\nmobile devices running the Android OS. This baked-in\n\nauto installer is used to update the device’s firmware, but\n\nit also steals personal information. This year, it’s our top\nrated mobile threat, with 255,514 detections. Not too far\n\ndown the list is another variant, Android/PUP.Riskware.\n\nAutoins.Fota.INS, with 65,589. Combined, this makes a\n\nstaggering 321,103 detections for this one family of pre\ninstalled malware alone.\n\n\nFigure 24. A look inside UMX U683CL, the US-funded mobile phone that came pre-installed with malware\n\n\n-----\n\n### HiddenAds\n\nUnsurprisingly, the second-most detected Android\n\nmalware is a large family of Android Trojans we detect\n\n[as Android/Trojan.HiddenAds. Why is that unsurprising?](http://Android/Trojan.HiddenAds)\n\nBecause it is a favorite silent install of the aforementioned\n\nAdups variant. Just looking at the top 10 list of Android\n\nthreats, excluding the PUP, monitor, and adware\n\ncategories, variants of HiddenAds are seen four times.\n\nCombined, this accounts for 283,233 detections in 2019.\n\n\nAlthough the Adups auto installer accounts for a number\n\nof these infections, it is also a favorite among infected\n\napps found on third-party app stores. HiddenAds’ only\n\nsymptoms are to aggressively display advertisements—\n\nby any means necessary. This includes but is not limited\n\nto: ads in notifications, on the lock screen, and full\n\nscreen pop-ups. Users who install HiddenAds apps are\n\nnot informed of the advertising behavior beforehand.\n\n\n### Monitor category: stalkerware\n\n\nOur monitor category saw a huge bump in detections\n\nthis year, but this cannot be attributed to an overall\n\nincrease of these types of threats on Androids, though\n\ntheir prevalence and public awareness does indeed\n\nseem to be growing. Thanks to concerted efforts\n\nbetween our research, writing, and product teams—as\n\n[well as a new coalition formed in 2019 among security](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/android-trojan-hiddenads/)\n\nvendors, digital rights advocates, shelters, and domestic\n\n[violence victim groups—Malwarebytes has cracked](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/stalkerware/2019/10/cybersecurity-domestic-violence-awareness-month-fight-stalkerware/)\n\n[down on apps deemed to be stalkerware.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/stalkerware/2019/10/cybersecurity-domestic-violence-awareness-month-fight-stalkerware/)\n\nThe term stalkerware can be applied to any application\n\n\nwith capabilities that allow it to be used to stalk or\n\nspy on someone else. That includes collecting the\n\nfollowing data from someone else’s device without\n\ntheir informed consent: GPS location data, photos,\n\nemails, text messages, call logs, contacts lists, non\npublic social media activity, and more. In addition, some\n\nstalkerware apps can be installed without displaying an\n\nicon or remotely operate a user’s device, microphone, or\n\ncamera. With over 100 new variants added in 2019, we\n\nare taking an even harder stance on these creepy apps,\n\nsome of which still appear in Google Play and Apple’s\n\niTunes stores.\n\n\nFigure 25. In October 2019, the FTC slapped Retina-X Studios, makers of the MobileSpy app, with a suit banning the company from\nselling its apps until changes were made—the first enforcement against stalkerware in US history.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Android threat summary\n\n\nThere are two pieces of stealthy mobile malware that\n\ndeserve mentioning in 2019. First up is Android/Trojan.\n\nDropper.xHelper. First seen in spring 2019, this malware\n\ntopped the charts for many weeks before fizzling out\n\nat the end of the year. There is high probably that this\n\naccounted for a drop in Android/Trojan.HiddenAds\n\nas well. The second stealth malware, Android/Trojan.\n\nFakeAdsBlock, was first seen in October and is still\n\ngoing strong into 2020. Just like HiddenAds, this Trojan\n\naggressively displays ads while hiding its presence on\n\nthe mobile device.\n\n\nThese two new variants highlight the increase of a\n\nstealthier and more aggressive breed of Android\n\nmalware in 2019. Whether its functionality is to drop\n\nother adware or to display aggressive ads itself, the\n\nproliferation of this type of threat shows cybercriminals’\n\nintent to skirt the law by the skin of their teeth while\n\nattempting to evade detection by mobile scanners.\n\nMake money and fly under the radar seems to be the\n\nname of the game in 2019. We predict this trend will\n\ncontinue into 2020.\n\n\n## Web threat landscape 2019\n\n\nThere is a strong correlation between the web threat\n\nlandscape and browser market share. In 2019, Google\n\nChrome still has the dominant position over rivals, such as\n\nMozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge. However, it is interesting\n\n[to note that Microsoft’s browser is one of many to switch](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20942038/microsoft-edge-chromium-release-date-new-logo-features)\n\n\nproject developed by Google) as its main engine.\n\nThe majority of web attacks we observe happen in the\n\nbackground, leveraging server-side compromises or\n\nrelying on social-engineering. However, throughout 2019\n\nInternet Explorer was still getting exploited, keeping\n\n\nor adopt Chromium (the open-source web browser\n\ndrive-by downloads alive.\n### Compromised infrastructure\n\n\nAs we’ve seen in the past, any website, big or small, can be\n\nvaluable to threat actors. The eventual payload will depend\n\non several factors in order to best maximize this resource.\n\nOne of the top Windows threats of 2019, Emotet, largely\n\nused compromised sites as part of its payload delivery.\n\nDisassociating the malware binary from the spam\n\nemail is not a new technique, but it continues to be\n\n\nan effective one, especially when it is done at scale by\n\nrelying on a large supply of hacked web properties.\n\n[A researcher described how Emotet is using WSO](https://github.com/NavyTitanium/Misc-Malwares/tree/master/Emotet)\n\nwebshells on compromised WordPress sites to keep\n\nthe malware payloads updated. This is another way of\n\nattempting to bypass detection by repacking code and\n\nthen pushing it back onto the distribution nodes.\n\n\nDecoy Compromised Final\nSpam email PowerShell\nDocument Site Payload\n\n\nFigure 26. Emotet distribution flow via attached document\n\n\n-----\n\n### Web skimmers\n\nFigure 27. Web skimming process\n\nOnline shoppers in 2019 were the target of credit\n\ncard skimmers, also known as web skimmers, or more\n\ngenerally referenced as Magecart.\n\nE-commerce sites are most valuable to attackers as\n\na source to steal payment information from unaware\n\ncustomers. By injecting malicious code (the skimmer) into\n\none of those sites, criminals can monitor when someone\n\nis on a checkout page and leak the data they type (name,\n\naddress, credit card number, etc.) in real time.\n\nWeb skimming became one of the most prevalent web\n\nthreats we tracked through 2019. During the past year,\n\nthe techniques improved, and the number of threat\n\nactors involved multiplied as well.\n\nUnlike other attacks that often require to either infect\n\nusers (banking Trojans) or social engineer them\n\n(phishing), web skimming works quietly on all devices\n\nand browsers. This makes it particularly effective and\n\nscalable to harvest and monetize stolen credit cards.\n\nThe challenge for defenders is to be able to detect\n\nthese compromises in order to map out and\n\nsubsequently block the criminal infrastructure. While\n\nmany skimmers are virtually invisible because they rely\n\non server-side code, even client-side ones can be very\n\n\nFigure 27. Web skimming process\n\n\nhard to identify. While threat actors could concentrate\n\non server-side skimmers only, in practice there are\n\nsome benefits to doing both. For example, many of\n\nthe e-commerce hacks can be traced to database\n\ninjections which are easier to do and harder for site\n\nowners to detect and clean up.\n\n[Some of the latest trends include using steganography](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/12/new-evasion-techniques-found-in-web-skimmers/)\n\n(a technique that consists of hiding data inside image\n\nfiles) as well as relying on the WebSocket protocol\n\ninstead of HTTP.\n\nSteganography has long been used by malware authors\n\nto smuggle their code inside innocuous images. In the\n\ncase of web threats, images are the perfect vehicle\n\nbecause they tend to be excluded from web scanners\n\ndue to their size. Parsing data other than typical HTML\n\nand JavaScript requires different tooling and takes up\n\ntime as well.\n\nThe same goes for WebSocket, which is a different\n\nprotocol than the most commonly used HTTP. Rather\n\nthan looking at a series of requests and responses, one\n\nhas to observe the bidirectional messages inside the\n\nWebSocket. By adding custom obfuscation to those\n\ncommunications, the exfiltration of stolen credit card\n\ndata will most likely never be caught.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 28. Skimmer hidden inside an image\n\n### Exploit kits\n\nThe drive-by download threat landscape is alive and well,\n\ndespite the fact that it still relies on an aging and ever\n\nless popular Internet Explorer browser. 2019 brought in\n\nmany surprises on this front, with the identification of\n\nseveral new exploit kits and the increased adoption of\n\nfileless payloads.\n\n[In fall 2019, we had registered nine active exploit kits](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/exploits-and-vulnerabilities/2019/11/exploit-kits-fall-2019-review/)\n\nranging from fairly unsophisticated ones, to more\n\nadvanced frameworks. Despite relying on less potent\n\nvulnerabilities (and no zero days), their developers\n\nmanaged to pack in some clever techniques to evade\n\nsandboxes and distribute their payloads in covert ways.\n\n\nFallout EK, Spelevo EK, and RIG EK came out as the\n\ntop three most active exploit kits serving stealers,\n\nransomware, and a variety of other malware. Stealers\n\nwere actually one of the most common payloads we\n\nsaw, either as a first drop or secondary via loaders such\n\nas Smoke Loader.\n\nOne particular exploit kit called Underminer EK has given\n\nus a lot of research material due to its unique payload\n\n(Hidden Bee) and tricks, including steganography, to\n\ndeceive researchers. We believe that it may be the work\n\nof an advanced group, rather than a standalone malware\n\nauthor.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29. Traffic capture from Underminer EK\n\n### Malvertising and redirection campaigns\n\n\nAs always, malvertising is adapting to the threat\n\nlandscape itself by pushing more scams onto desktop\n\nand mobile users. It remains the primary vector to\n\ndistribute fake software updates.\n\nHowever, we have seen a return of compromises on\n\nlarger sites as well with the purpose of redirecting traffic.\n\n[This includes the FakeUpdates campaign discovered in](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/04/fakeupdates-campaign-leverages-multiple-website-platforms/)\n\n[2018 and the newly-discovered Domen toolkit, which](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering/2019/09/new-social-engineering-toolkit-draws-inspiration-from-previous-web-campaigns/)\n\ncombines several elements from various predecessors\n\nand was built on a rental model.\n\nBrowser lockers, also known as browlocks, continue\n\n\nto fuel most of the calls leading to tech support\n\nscams. Users are redirected to these fake pages via\n\na combination of malvertising or redirection from\n\ncompromised sites. While many browlocks can be\n\nclosed using the user interface, occasionally the crooks\n\ncome up with new templates that effectively block\n\nusers out of their computer, short of forcefully killing the\n\nbrowser process. Google Chrome was historically the\n\nmost targeted browser in this area, but Mozilla Firefox\n\nseems to be the newer focus, and was caught in a true\n\n[browlock in November 2019.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/scammers-are-exploiting-an-unpatched-firefox-bug-to-send-users-into-a-panic/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 30. Fake error messages from the Domen toolkit\n\n### Web threats summary\n\nThe web threat landscape in 2019 was dominated by\n\nonline credit card skimmers as they provide direct and\n\nquick monetization to criminals with limited effort. Web\n\nskimmers can also be more difficult to protect against,\n\nespecially because they do not compromise machines\n\nvia exploit and can reside only inside the infrastructure\n\nof online stores.\n\nCompromised infrastructure on its own is a problem that\n\nhas large repercussions on the overall web ecosystem.\n\nIt’s clear that threat actors will continue to automate the\n\nhacking of sites in bulk and use them as a commodity for\n\ndistributing malware, such as Emotet.\n\nExploit kits generated a level of activity that surprised\n\nus and, despite relying on using older vulnerabilities,\n\n\nshowed some creative ways of infecting systems. As\n\nWindows 7 comes out of support in 2020, it remains to\n\nbe seen how much longer threat actors will be able to\n\nabuse IE. What we may see instead is a shift to other\n\nbrowsers, as the few zero-days seen in 2019 indicate that\n\nas a possibility for targeted or mainstream attacks.\n\nMalvertising and malicious redirections in general have\n\nbeen a continuous problem, despite the wide adoption\n\nof ad blockers. Attackers keep coming up with clever\n\nways to abuse technologies that were meant to make\n\nthe web better and faster. Although the browser market\n\nis dominated by Google Chrome, a new browser way\n\n(where privacy and ads are at the center of discussions)\n\nmay very well be looming.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Regional threats 2019\n\n###### Regional detections 2019\n\n APAC 12%\n\n EMEA NORAM 26% 48%\n\n LATAM 14%\n\nFigure 31. Percentage of threats per region\n\n\nSwinging back around to “traditional malware,” we’ll\n\nnow slice and dice our 2019 detections according to\n\nfour distinct regions: North America (NORAM), Europe,\n\nthe Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific (APAC),\n\nand Latin America (LATAM). Unsurprising, NORAM came\n\naway with the lion’s share of threats, with 48 percent\n\n\nof the world’s malware aimed at the North American\n\ncontinent. EMEA also grabbed a large slice of the pie at\n\n26 percent. LATAM and APAC brought up the rear at 14\n\nand 12 percent, respectively.\n\n\n### NORAM threat landscape 2019\n\n\nNorth America was at the receiving end of more\n\nthan 24 million threats, up 10 percent from 2018 and\n\ncomprising almost half of all detections in 2019. The top\n\nfive countries impacted in NORAM were, in descending\n\norder: the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, US Virgin\n\nIslands, and Guam.\n\nAdware features heavily in NORAM regions, taking\n\nmost of the top five positions across the US, Canada,\n\nand Puerto Rico for consumer detections. Emotet and\n\nTrickBot both made strong showings for both US and\n\nCanadian business detections (first and second place\n\n\nfor Canada; second and third place for the US), while\n\nPuerto Rico’s top business detection is a worm known as\n\nConficker.\n\nWhile overall detections decreased by 1 and 5 percent\n\nfor Canada and Puerto Rico, detections in the US shot\n\nup by 10 percent from 21,371,182 in 2018 to 23,625,567\n\nin 2019. For all the potency of Emotet and TrickBot, the\n\nnumber one detection for US businesses is the Yontoo\n\nadware. The US is traditionally the home of a huge\n\narray of adware and PUP development, yet it may still\n\nsurprise some to discover that browser extensions are so\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 32. Top NORAM threats 2019\n\npervasive in corporations, where locked-down browsers\n\nand other software should, in theory, make for smooth\n\nday-to-day operations.\n\nEven so, the power of Emotet and TrickBot should\n\nnever be discounted. Major North American attacks\n\n\n[took place throughout the year, with large spam runs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/emotet-todays-most-dangerous-botnet-comes-back-to-life/)\n\nand more focused phishing tactics for Emotet, and\n\n[new techniques and targets, including healthcare](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/trojans/2019/09/trickbot-adds-new-trick-to-its-arsenal-tampering-with-trusted-texts/)\n\n[organizations, for TrickBot as well. NORAM users should](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/reports/2019/11/labs-report-cyberthreats-healthcare-increasing-security-circles-drain/)\n\nexpect to see plenty of this dangerous duo in 2020.\n\n\n### EMEA threat landscape 2019\n\n\nLooking at the developments in EMEA from 2018 to 2019,\n\nwe can see a major trend that reflects what happened\n\naround the globe: the number of cryptominer detections\n\nfor both consumers and businesses dropped to make\n\nroom for more adware. Overall detections decreased\n\nminimally by roughly 2 percent, except for France, which\n\ndropped by almost 16 percent.\n\n\nWhile EMEA detections don’t differ much from those\n\nin NORAM from a broad, regional perspective, we start\n\nto see more “cultural differences” in the top detections\n\nwhen we compare the top three countries and their\n\nmost prevalent malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 33. Top consumer and business threats in the UK, France, and Germany\n\nEMEA’s top five countries in 2019 by threat volume\n\nwere, in descending order: the United Kingdom, France,\n\nGermany, Spain, and Russia. Compared to 2018, the\n\nonly notable change is Russia dropping from second\n\nplace to fifth.\n\nOnce again, we see Emotet, TrickBot, SecurityRun,\n\nHackTools, and various adware families. But some\n\nnotable differences include an adware family called\n\nKeenValue as the top German consumer threat, and a\n\nbackdoor making its way to the third most-detected\n\nthreat on German business endpoints. In France,\n\nWannaCry (detected as WannaCrypt) still factors\n\nheavy in detections as the top business threat, while a\n\nrootkit named Cidox came in at fifth place in business\n\ndetections. Meanwhile, the UK looked the picture of the\n\nNorth American threat landscape, with the exception\n\nof a Trojan injector wiggling its way into fourth place in\n\nbusiness detections.\n\nNot to be outdone by the action across the pond,\n\nEmotet managed to make quite a splash in EMEA in\n\n\n2019. In the public sector, the botnet crippled the city of\n\nFrankfurt, one of the largest financial hubs in the world\n\nand the home of the European Central Bank.\n\nMissing from top detections, but not to be discounted:\n\nThe dominance of ransomware as the main threat\n\ncontinued to make headlines in EMEA. Noteworthy\n\nEuropean victims of ransomware were the universities\n\nof Freiburg and Maastricht. But the commercial sector\n\nwas hit almost as bad. The most newsworthy stories\n\nwere those of Norwegian Norsk Hydro ASA, which is\n\na major global player in the aluminum and renewable\n\nenergy sectors, as well as Belgian metal producer\n\nNyrstar. On the other end of the EMEA region, the city of\n\nJohannesburg, the largest city in South Africa, fell victim\n\nto a ransomware called Bitpaymer.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APAC detections w/o Singapore/Aus/NZ 2018-2019\n\n\n###### 5.

At a 7 percent increase with\n\n114,654 total detections, it remains one of the most\n\nsought-after targets by cybercriminals. This is because\n\ncybersecurity—not to mention privacy—have taken a\n\nbackseat in retail. Having little resources allotted for\n\n\nsecurity and a severe lack of training among employees\n\nonly compound the problem. Also, retail has a wide\n\nrange of potential attack vectors, from Magecart\n\nskimmers, malvertising, and other online compromises\n\nto antiquated or vulnerable point-of-sale (POS) systems,\n\nto openness to fraud. Organizations in the retail\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 44.

In fact, what’s more surprising is that it\n\nisn’t higher up on the list or that there aren’t multiple\n\nfamilies dominating the top five, considering retail are\n\n\nsome of the strongest advertisers themselves. In 2019,\n\nEmotet and TrickBot made more of an impact on retail\n\norganizations, and WannaCry infections fell one spot\n\nto second place.

The\n\nnew Facebook would include end-to-end encryption\n\nacross its three largest platforms (Facebook Messenger,\n\n\n-----\n\nInstagram, and WhatsApp), disappearing messages,\n\nposts, and photos, and a commitment to store less user\n\ndata, while also refusing to put that data in countries\n\nwith poor human rights records.\n\n[Facebook’s end-to-end encryption project is nowhere](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-default/)\n\n[near done, but that is largely due to the expected](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-default/)\n\ntechnological complexity of rehauling and merging\n\nthree different chat systems into one, secure system.\n\nFacebook’s announcement received mixed responses\n\nfrom a public burnt out on the company’s mishaps. Two\n\nweeks after Zuckerberg made his promises, Facebook\n\n[admitted that it previously stored hundreds of millions](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/)\n\n[of user passwords in plain text for years.

The documents also revealed\n\nthat Facebook’s plan to restrict certain third-party access\n\nto user data—though described to the public as a pro\n### Data privacy in US law\n\nFor a few of the above privacy fiascos, Congress\n\nstepped in. One Senator asked Amazon about Ring’s\n\npartnerships with police and its data collection\n\nprotections. Another Senator asked Google about how\n\nit failed to tell consumers about an internal microphone\n\ninstalled in a device that is meant for the home.\n\nBut 2019 was not just a year of Congressional questions.\n\n[It was a year of Congressional and legislative demands.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/privacy-2/2019/12/online-privacy-in-2019-a-legislative-review/)\n\nAcross the US, federal and state lawmakers introduced\n\ndozens of bills and bill amendments to protect Americans’\n\n[data privacy.

COPRA aims to](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/privacy-2/2019/12/new-consumer-online-privacy-rights-act-copra-would-empower-consumers/)\n\nimprove the relationship that Americans have with\n\ntechnology companies by empowering them with\n\nnew rights to control their data, while also placing new\n\nrestrictions on how companies collect and share that\n\ndata.\n\nIf passed, Americans would enjoy new data privacy\n\nrights, including the rights to access, delete, and correct\n\ncertain types of data, along with the right to take\n\ntheir data and move it to another company. Further,\n\nsome data, which COPRA calls “sensitive covered\n\ndata,” would be prohibited from collection unless a\n\nuser gives explicit, opt-in approval. That type of data\n\nincludes passport numbers, Social Security numbers,\n\ninformation about physical and mental health, financial\n\naccount usernames and passwords, biometrics, precise\n\ngeolocation, communications content and metadata\n\n\n-----\n\n(the time a message was sent and what user or phone\n\nnumber it was sent to), emails, phone numbers, and any\n\ninformation that reveals race, religion, sexual orientation\n\nand behavior, and union membership.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, under COPRA, individuals\n\nwould have the right to sue a company that violated their\n\ndata privacy rights. And while COPRA gives the public\n\nnew rights, it also gives companies new responsibilities.\n\nIf the bill passes, companies would need to post a clear,\n\neasy-to-find data privacy policy on their websites, select\n\nand name a data privacy officer and data security officer,\n\ninstall data security practices, and commit to “data\n\nminimization,” which would prohibit companies from\n\nprocessing or transferring certain user data “beyond\n\nwhat is reasonably necessary, proportionate, and\n\nlimited.”\n\nThough many of COPRA’s legislative contenders were\n\nintroduced in the Senate, a separate data privacy bill\n\nintroduced in the House of Representatives caught\n\n### Data privacy summary\n\nOn January 1, California’s Consumer Privacy Act came\n\ninto effect, almost a year and a half after it was signed by\n\nthe former governor. Its eventual, regulatory impact will\n\ntake time to assess, but its immediate, influential impact\n\ncan already be measured.\n\nAs one of the first states to pass data privacy legislation,\n\nCalifornia’s efforts have been matched by Maine and\n\nNevada, which both passed data privacy laws last year.\n\n\nattention last year—the Online Privacy Act of 2019. As the\n\nbill states, its purpose is “to provide for individual rights\n\nrelating to privacy of personal information, to establish\n\nprivacy and security requirements for covered entities\n\nrelating to personal information, and to establish an\n\nagency to be known as the United States Digital Privacy\n\nAgency to enforce such rights and requirements, and for\n\nother purposes.”\n\nThe proposed “United States Digital Privacy Agency”\n\nwould serve as a government enforcement arm devoted\n\nto the increasing problem of data privacy violations.\n\nBut that idea has sparked opposition by lawmakers who\n\nbelieve data privacy enforcement should remain with the\n\nFederal Trade Commission.\n\nUnfortunately, that agency’s track record for effective\n\nenforcement has been less than stellar—remember that\n\nwhen Facebook received its record-breaking $5 billion\n\nfine, its public stock price shot up.\n\nMeanwhile, data privacy legislation has been introduced\n\nin a bevvy of other US states, including Connecticut,\n\nHawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,\n\nMinnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,\n\nNorth Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and\n\nWashington. It appears that, whether Congress is ready\n\nor not, data privacy will become the law of the land.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2020 cybersecurity predictions\n\n\nWe’ve had a predictably unpredictable year for\n\ncybercrime in 2019, though many of the issues we were\n\nconcerned about heading into the year turned out to be\n\njustified by increased activity or efforts to exploit, infect,\n\ncollect, and blackmail users and their systems.\n\nSo, what about 2020? Is it going to be different? We’ve\n\ncollected six highly likely predictions for the next 12\n\nmonths, based on what we’ve seen in the past and what\n\nwe’re most afraid of in the future.\n\n##### Ransomware attacks on organizations will continue at a more rapid pace, thanks to a diversification in attack vectors.\n\nOver the last two years, malware developers have turned\n\ntheir focus to business targets over consumers, and\n\nransomware is the threat of choice. While in the past,\n\nransomware was typically delivered via exploit, 2019 saw\n\na huge diversity in attack vectors dropping their favorite\n\nmalware on organizations’ endpoints, from exploit kits to\n\nbotnets to hacking tools and manual infection.\n\nWe saw more vulnerabilities in 2017 and 2018 than in\n\nany year before, and 2019 was a close match in volume.\n\nMore vulnerabilities means more exploits, and we’re likely\n\nto see some of the 43,000 vulnerabilities discovered\n\nover the last two years show up in future EK offerings.\n\nWe saw an example of this with BlueKeep, a software\n\nvulnerability that affects older versions of Microsoft\n\nWindows. It attacks an operating system’s Remote\n\nDesktop Protocol (RDP), which connects to another\n\ncomputer over a network connection to quickly spread.\n\nWe’ve seen so much Emotet and TrickBot in the last two\n\nyears—often the precursors to ransomware payloads—\n\n\nwe’ve starting saying their names in our sleep.\n\nThe “triple threat” attack model has proven so\n\neffective, we expect even more Trojans and\n\ndroppers and downloaders and botnets to\n\njoin the party in 2020, offering affiliates\n\na multitude of options for multi-stage\n\nattacks.\n\nFinally, the development and\n\nprevalence of malicious hacking\n\ntools designed to more effectively\n\nattack networks will surely attract\n\nransomware authors and affiliates\n\nto first penetrate, then decimate\n\nbusiness infrastructures in 2020.\n\nBottom line, this ransomware\n\nproblem isn’t going away. We are\n\nlikely to see more non-affiliated\n\ncybercriminals using tricks developed by\n\nstate-sponsored malware groups (APT), as\n\nwe did with EternalBlue. And if we do, we’re\n\nin for a turbulent year of cybercrime.\n\n##### Web skimmers will broaden their impact by going after  more e-commerce platforms and plug-ins.\n\nLooking at web skimming activity in 2019, we saw that\n\nthere was no target too big to take on and no platform\n\nspared. As long as there is data to be stolen, criminals\n\nwill put the effort into compromising online merchants\n\ndirectly or indirectly. The indirect attacks are, in fact,\n\nmore dangerous, more pervasive, and easier to pull off.\n\nEssentially any third-party code such as web libraries\n\n\n-----\n\ncan be\n\n\ntampered\n\n\nwith and\n\n\nloaded by a number\n\nof websites downstream.\n\nThe current state of web\n\nsecurity is still way behind, and most\n\nshops are not validating external content before loading\n\nit. That’s why we expect to see a lot more of these\n\nattacks in 2020.\n\nAnother shift we will see is in the placement of\n\nskimmers. The majority of them are loaded at the\n\ncheckout form, where customers enter their payment\n\ndata. However, we now see skimmers impersonating\n\npayment processors, social engineering users with\n\nphishing-like tricks. Overall, this is a dynamic field where\n\nwe can expect to see many novel attack techniques\n\nintroduced over the next year.\n\n##### Exploit kit activity will be at its highest since the post-Angler era.\n\nWhile this may seem counterintuitive, since Internet\n\nExplorer market share is decreasing, we expect to see\n\na surge of exploits and zero days pivot to Chrome and\n\nChromium-based browsers in 2020. This year, we heard\n\nof at least a few zero-day vulnerabilities for Google\n\nChrome. While rare and difficult to achieve, they are\n\nbecoming more common. And since the browser market\n\nwill be even more dominated by Chrome/Chromium\n\nbecause of Microsoft’s Edge browser switch to a\n\nChromium engine in January 2020, attackers will see\n\nthese two as prime targets for exploitation.\n\nIn addition, we expect to see more drive-by attacks\n\ninvolving fileless malware. Magnitude EK, Underminer\n\nEK, and Purple Fox are all current examples of exploit kits\n\nthat do not drop a typical payload on disk. Their success\n\nwill fuel copycats and code-toppers in 2020 looking to\n\nedge out the old guard.\n\n\n##### Biometrics and genetic tracking will draw an international outcry for data privacy laws.\n\nOver the last year, we’ve seen some worrying\n\ndevelopments in the collection, dissemination, selling,\n\n[sharing, and stealing of health data. Consumer DNA](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2018/11/dna-testing-kit-companies-really-data/)\n\n[testing kits drew warnings from the Pentagon about](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2018/11/dna-testing-kit-companies-really-data/)\n\nnational security, accuracy, and career implications.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada, the United States, and China\n\nquietly amassed DNA databases for tracking immigrants\n\n[and citizens. London’s police force rolled out facial](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51237665)\n\n[recognition cameras throughout the city in January](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51237665)\n\n[2020, much to the chagrin of its citizens. Google’s](https://time.com/5717726/google-fitbit/)\n\n[purchase of Fitbit worried users about the dissemination](https://time.com/5717726/google-fitbit/)\n\nof health data to advertisers, though the company\n\npublicly stated that health and wellness data would not\n\n[be used for Google ads. Menstrual tracking apps have](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/01/23/period-tracker-apps-privacy-concerns/4546797002/)\n\ndrawn much the same ire.\n\nWhat will happen to this private healthcare information?\n\nConsumers are generally unaware that their health\n\ntracking devices could be used for unauthorized\n\npurposes, by legitimate companies and cybercriminals\n\nalike. And health tracking apps, facial recognition\n\ncameras, and DNA databases all paint concerning\n\npictures when considered in the context of abuse by law\n\nenforcement, immigration, or repressive governments.\n\nThe increased use of biometric data for authentication\n\ncalls for stronger regulations for data privacy, and\n\nconsumers and pro-privacy organizations will push hard\n\non lawmakers to make that a reality in 2020.\n\n##### Election security mishaps will undermine the confidence of US voters.\n\nFrom compromised voting machines to fake news\n\nspread across the Internet and social media, US voters\n\nwill call into question the reliability of the voting process,\n\nespecially if the results of the 2020 presidential election\n\nonce again fail to align with projections. Foreign\n\n\n-----\n\ndisinformation is at an all-time high, the result of nation\nstate actors tasked with destabilizing the country.\n\nScammers and malware authors will, of course, use\n\nthe election to spread their threats via phishing emails.\n\nHowever, we will also see plenty of deepfakes and\n\ncheapfakes technology used political purposes. And\n\nwhile some journalists will be able to verify the veracity\n\nof a particular soundbyte or video, users following\n\npropogandist or radial publications on both sides of the\n\npolitical spectrum will likely believe what they want to\n\nbelieve.\n\nFrom a lower tech perspective, we expect to see floods\n\nof bot accounts on social media, created with more\n\nbackground and “humanity” than we’ve seen before.\n\nWith a greater deployment of refined AI technologies, it\n\nwill be harder to spot these accounts in 2020 because\n\nof how convincing they are made. Regardless of scam\n\ntactics or potential voting machine compromises, the\n\nreal threat will be the attacks on our hearts and minds\n\nthrough social media and media manipulation.\n\n##### Hybrid attacks with multi-stage payloads will escalate. \n\nA multi-stage attack allows for an attacker to infiltrate a\n\nnetwork in the most efficient and effective way possible.\n\nThe first stage gathers information so the attacker can\n\nconsider the best way to launch the next stage of the\n\nattack, which could include further infection across\n\nthe network or the sale of the infection to someone\n\nwho wants to mine for cryptocurrency or spread more\n\nmalware.\n\n\nWhile we already mentioned the triple threat in reference\n\nto ransomware, we predict there will be more types of\n\nmalware developed in 2020 where the dwell time will\n\nbe days or even weeks before attackers decide on what\n\nto do next. This is an interesting type of monetization\n\nby alternating payloads and conducting proper victim\n\ntriage.\n\nSo those are our predictions for 2020, today. From bots\n\nto exploits to criminals stealing your DNA, the future is all\n\nabout privacy, authentication, and non-repudiation. Let’s\n\nhope that the attacks launched against our identities\n\nand how, or who we trust online, push forward new\n\ndevelopment of tech and policy that combats this\n\ngrowing trend.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite relative plateaus in threat numbers across\n\nthe globe, it’s been a fascinating and tumultuous year\n\nin cybercrime. Mac and Android threats increased in\n\nvolume and severity. Businesses, governments, and\n\nschools were hit with sophisticated and diverse threats\n\naimed at disrupting critical infrastructure. Adware\n\ninundated consumer and business users on all platforms\n\nand in all regions. Exploit kits, malvertising campaigns,\n\nand web skimmers threatened browsers. Consumers\n\nand lawmakers worried about the safety of their PII\n\nand other data. There was no oasis where users could\n\nescape from cybercrime in the 2019 threat landscape.\n\n### Contributors\n\n\nTen years ago, average Internet users embraced social\n\nmedia, browsed without abandon, and just started\n\nexperimenting with smart devices, holding mini\n\ncomputers in their hands instead of simple phones.\n\nRemote work was uncommon. Data breaches were\n\nunheard of. Cybercrime, security, and data privacy were\n\nhardly matters of public concern, relegated to lone\n\nbasement-dwellers and super-technical early adopters.\n\nAs we march into the next decade, considering how\n\nquaint those early days of the 2010s sound now, we\n\nrealize how far we’ve come—and how seriously we\n\nshould all be taking our cybersecurity practices now.\n\n\n###### Adam Kujawa Director of Malwarebytes Labs\n\n Wendy Zamora Editor-in-chief, Malwarebytes Labs\n\n Jerome Segura Director of Threat Intelligence\n\n Thomas Reed Director of Mac and Mobile\n\n[blog.malwarebytes.com](http://blog.malwarebytes.com)\n\n\n###### Nathan Collier Senior Malware Intelligence Analyst, Mobile\n\n Jovi Umawing Senior Threat Content Writer\n\n Chris Boyd Senior Threat  Intelligence Analyst\n\n\n###### Pieter Arntz Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst\n\n David Ruiz Threat Content Writer,  Online Privacy\n\n\n[corporate-sales@malwarebytes.com](mailto:corporate-sales%40malwarebytes.com?subject=)\n\n1.800.520.2796\n\n\nMalwarebytes is a cybersecurity company that millions worldwide trust.\nMalwarebytes proactively protects people and businesses against malicious\nthreats, including ransomware, that traditional antivirus solutions miss.
