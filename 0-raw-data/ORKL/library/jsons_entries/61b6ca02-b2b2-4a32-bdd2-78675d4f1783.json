    "plain_text": "# WARZONE RAT – Beware Of The Trojan Malware Stealing Data Triggering From Various Office Documents\n\n**blogs.quickheal.com/warzone-rat-beware-of-the-trojan-malware-stealing-data-triggering-from-various-office-**\ndocuments/\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\nWarzone RAT is part of an APT campaign named “Confucius.” Confucius APT is known to\ntarget government sectors of China and few other South Asian countries. This APT\ncampaign was quite active around January 2021. Warzone RAT first emerged in 2018 as\nmalware-as-a-service (MaaS) and is known for its aggressive use of “.docx” files as its initial\ninfection vector. The initial payload is known as “Ave Maria Stealer,” which can steal\ncredentials and log keystrokes on the victim’s machine. The advanced version of this\nmalware is currently sold in the underground market for $22.95 per month and $49.95 for\nthree months. The Warzone creators have an official website where it’s up for sale.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Warzone website showing selling price_\n\nThese are the various features of the RAT mentioned on the website:\n\nRemote Desktop & Webcam\nPrivilege Escalation – UAC Bypass\nPassword Recovery\nDownload & Execute.\nLive Keylogger\nRemote Shell\nPersistence\nWindows Defender Bypass\n\nWe came across a cracked version of Warzone RAT on GitHub. Here is the screenshot of\nthat repository:\n\n_Figure 2: A cracked version of warzone on GitHub_\n\nBased on our research, we confirmed that the threat actor is trying to circumvent attacks with\na decoy and manipulate users, delivering the next stage payload via template injection\ntechnique. In this blog, we are going to talk about “.docx” used as an initial attack vector and\nhow it’s delivering its final payload -Warzone RAT.\n\n## Technical Analysis:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Attack Chain_\n\nThe various phases of the attack are:\n\nThe victim opens the word document.\nThis document further downloads an RTF exploit (CVE-2017-11882).\nExploit in RTF is triggered and muka.dll is dropped and executed.\nMuka.dll downloads Warzone RAT.\n\n**Phase 1:**\n\nHere the infection chain starts with a “.docx” file. We can see below the decoy document\n(Hash: 59ccfff73bdb8567e7673a57b73f86fc082b0e4eeaa3faf7e92875c35bf4f62c). This\ndecoy document was crafted by attackers to induce the victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Screenshot from the “Suparco Vacancy Notification.docx”_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile executing, it uses the template injection technique to download the next stage RTF\nexploit. This exploit delivers a dll embedded final payload that connects to the domain to\nconnect to the CNC to download payload Warzone Rat. We can see from the below image.\n\n_Figure 5: Using Template Injection Technique_\n\nThe RTF exploit is downloaded through “\\word\\_rels\\settings.xml.rels” file present in\ndocument structure using template injection technique as shown below.\n\n_Figure 6: settings.xml.rels containing a link to the template_\n\n**Phase 2:**\n\nThe downloaded RTF file (Hash:\n_686847b331ace1b93b48528ba50507cbf0f9b59aef5b5f539a7d6f2246135424) contains code_\nthat exploits an old vulnerability “CVE-2017-11882”. The flaw resides within equation editor\n(EQNEDT32.exe), a component in Microsoft office that inserts or edits object linking and\nembedding (OLE) Objects. We found that muka.dll is embedded in an OLE object.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: muka.dll embedded in an ole object_\n\n**Phase 3:**\n\nThe embedded muka.dll file (Hash:\n_1c41a03c65108e0d965b250dc9b3388a267909df9f36c3fefffbd26d512a2126) contains export_\nfunction zenu and this dll is used to provide functionalities to other programs. Here is an\nimage showing this:\n\n_Figure 8: Export directory containing export function zenu_\n\n**Phase 4:**\n\nUpon successful exploitation, the dll connects to a malicious domain (wordupdate.com)\nwhich is active nowadays also and downloads the final warzone payload.\n\n_Figure 9: Requesting access to the malicious domain_\n\nThe Warzone payload is saved as update.exe (Hash:\n_7dd1dba508f4b74d50a22f41f0efe3ff4bc30339e9eef45d390d32de2aa2ca2b)._\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\n-----\n\nWarzone RAT exploits a pretty old but popular vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882, in Microsoft s\nequation editor component. This RAT works as an Info stealer malware. Attackers typically\nspread such malware through document files as email attachments. We recommend our\ncustomers not to access suspicious emails/attachments and keep their AV software up-todate to protect their systems from such complex malware. We detect the initial infection\nvector as well as the final Warzone RAT as XML.Downloader.39387 and\nTrojan.GenericRI.S16988580 respectively.\n\n**IOCs:**\n\nDOCX:59ccfff73bdb8567e7673a57b73f86fc082b0e4eeaa3faf7e92875c35bf4f62c\nRTF:686847b331ace1b93b48528ba50507cbf0f9b59aef5b5f539a7d6f2246135424\nDLL:1c41a03c65108e0d965b250dc9b3388a267909df9f36c3fefffbd26d512a2126\nEXE:7dd1dba508f4b74d50a22f41f0efe3ff4bc30339e9eef45d390d32de2aa2ca2b\n\n**Domains:**\n\n_recent.wordupdate.com_\n_wordupdate.com_\n\n**Ayush Puri**\n\n[Follow @](https://twitter.com/)\n\n\n-----",
