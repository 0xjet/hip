Any one of those could be malicious and\nharboring a mobile malware app, right there in a trusted official app store. In an ongoing\ntrend, IBM X-Force noted that malicious apps manage to circumvent controls and infiltrate\n[legitimate stores. And this is not about the plethora of adware apps infecting users in the app](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/818772/Android-warning-Google-Play-adware)\nstores, which has almost become the norm, but rather that banking malware is now turning\ninto somewhat of a resident in Google Play.\n\nBankBot is one of the mobile banking Trojans that has taken to the Play store in the past few\nmonths, managing to get through in the guise of widgets and benign apps. After the\n[discovery and takedown of these apps — hundreds of them, to be exact — it seems that](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/hundreds-of-google-play-apps/)\nBankBot still finds ways to get in and infect unwitting users.\n\nIn a recent discovery, IBM X-Force mobile researchers identified at least 20 different\nmalicious Android apps that made it into Google’s Play store delivering BankBot.\n\nLanding a place in official app stores is both effective and profitable for cybercriminals who\noperate mobile malware. For one, they do not have to invest in the distribution of the\nmalware. They can save on costs associated with spam lists, SMS messaging or sending\nmass emails, not knowing who would eventually click and bother fetching the app from a\nthird-party store — provided they’ve already enabled side-loading. It’s a longer shot.\n\nSecond, malicious apps will get all that much more exposure in an official store, where\nhundreds of millions of people search for apps daily. Botnets are always a numbers game.\nBeyond sheer traffic, malware that makes it into the official stores enjoys the trust factor that\ncomes with downloading an app from a legitimate source, likely leading to more app\npermissions being granted to malicious applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Worried about mobile security? You should be. Read the white paper to learn more](https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=mrs-form-3310&S_PKG=ov50873)\n\n## A Dangerous, Rising Trend\n\n[Bad Android apps making it into the official app store is not new by any means. It appears](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/06/18/google-android-hacker-claims-innocence-as-banking-trojans-spread/#cac976c6a6f3)\nthat criminals manage to find their way into legitimate stores, concealing their malware or\nincluding it in app updates that comes later on.\n\nThe rising trend is this: While adware and other nuisance apps have been making in into\nofficial app stores for the past few years, now we are seeing banking malware increasingly\nshowing up in those trusted download sources. This trend is extremely problematic because\nit introduces an entirely different threat level to the users of official stores, making them\ndownload a mobile banking Trojan, which can inevitably lead to a significant rise in fraudulent\nfinancial activity in the weeks and months following the installation.\n\n## BankBot — In Store and Ready for Fraud\n\n[The BankBot malware emerged in January 2017, initially identified in the wild as](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=14895561&lng=en)\n[Android.BankBot.149, go_p00t, and later named BankBot and Mazain. In essence, all these](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/BankBot-c7c285af82fbaf0c9a6c93431e47d077)\n[malware names relate to the same code base that was](https://github.com/bemre/bankbot-mazain) [leaked soon after it was discovered.](https://www.scmagazine.com/bankbot-created-with-leaked-banking-trojan-source-code/article/633264/)\n\nAccording to X-Force research, BankBot affects only Android-based mobile devices at this\ntime. It is part of the overlay class of mobile banking Trojans, which uses fake activity\nscreens on top of legitimate apps to lure users into divulging their banking and payment card\ncredentials. BankBot is geared toward financial fraud, and used by cybercriminals to commit\nidentity theft, account takeover and spamming of the malware to additional devices.\n\nIn April 2017, IBM X-Force researchers observed this malware use another notable manner\nto get into the official Play store. It started out as a benign application purporting to display\nfunny videos. After downloading and executing it, the app would update itself, fetching and\ninstalling malware modules into the original application. This effectively turned the once\nbenign app into a mobile banking malware complete with permissions and persistency on the\ndevice.\n\n## BankBot’s Fraud M.O.\n\nBefore mobile malware, cybercriminals looking to take over bank accounts for fraudulent\ntransactions would run into SMS-based two-factor authentication and get stuck.\n\nThose launching phishing attacks saw their attack capabilities quickly decline as more banks\nadopted out-of-band authentication challenges. To bypass this authentication method, they\nstarted writing SMS hijackers, convincing infected PC owners to download those apps to\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir smartphones. This social engineering worked for a while, but it required resources and\na very convincing ploy to make victims enable side-loading and get the malicious app from a\nthird-party store.\n\nThis is where mobile banking Trojans such as BankBot came in. They are a one-stop shop\nfor authentication elements cybercriminals typically use to take over an account. The\nfollowing is the takeover flow for criminals using malware like BankBot.\n\nIt’s important to note that the infection begins on a mobile device, usually unbeknownst to the\ncommon user. When the fraud attempt eventually takes place, it happens from an entirely\ndifferent device. The attacker uses his or her own endpoint to access the victim’s bank’s\nwebsite to initiate the fraudulent transaction, and the user will not always logically connect\nthe dots and realize the two are linked.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen victims see their phones locked with a fake update message displayed by BankBot,\nthey may think that there’s a technical issue. They could reach out to a local mobile repair\nshop or call their service provider to ask about it. Even if they do realize they’ve been hit by\nmalware, it’s difficult to know what sort of malware and know that their bank account, and\nsometimes payment cards, have most likely been compromised at that point.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the malware prevents victims from receiving calls, and so\nprevents banks from being able to contact them about the suspicious transaction. By often\nresorting to a factory reset, victims unfortunately eliminate forensic information that can be\nuseful for identification and analysis of the infection.\n\nAccording to X-Force research, BankBot variants have been actively targeting banks in\nSpain and in France in July 2017. BankBot and the M.O. described in this post were\n[detected and thwarted by IBM Trusteer Mobile SDK. The account takeover phase was](https://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/trusteer-mobile-sdk)\n[detected with holistic cross-channel detection capabilities provided by IBM Trusteer Pinpoint](https://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/trusteer-pinpoint-criminal-detection)\nDetect.\n\n_Figure 1: BankBot infected devices per device geography (Source: IBM Trusteer)_\n\nAdditionally, recent BankBot target lists include banks in Australia, Germany and Romania.\n\nX-Force research noted that BankBot is an overlay Android bot. It monitors for the launch of\ntargeted banking applications on the infected device and then dynamically fetches a\nmatching HTML overlay from its controller’s server. The overlay is presented to users, hiding\nthe original app they may have opened and requesting their online banking credentials,\ncredit card details or login combination. Once entered, the malware sends the details to the\nattacker in cleartext.\n\nUpon installation, this malware requests app administrator privileges on the device under the\nguise of a system update. Once installed, the application icon disappears, but the app\ncontinues to run in the background. BankBot will not operate if it detects that the infected\n\n\n-----\n\ndevice is located in CIS countries, alluding to its possible operator s whereabouts.\n\nBankBot can lock the device’s screen to keep the user out when it is performing fraudulent\nactivity on the victim’s account; to do so, it displays a fake update message on screen to\ndelay access attempts to the device. The malware further possesses data exfiltration\ncapabilities that enable it to hijack incoming SMS messages and forward them to the\nattacker, thus compromising SMS-based two-factor authentication.\n\nSince it is commercially available in underground forums and code-sharing sites, BankBot\ntargets include a long list of banks across Europe, especially in Spain, Australia, New\nZealand and some banks in Argentina. In some cases, the malware targets both Android\nsmartphone and Android tablet versions of the banking apps it is after, depending on the\nbotnet’s operator’s goals.\n\n## More to Come?\n\nAccording to ongoing research by X-Force, mobile malware has been rising in sophistication\nin the past few years, making it less surprising to see its operators manage to circumvent\nautomated security controls on legitimate app stores.\n\nWith various code leaks in the mobile malware scene, the number of malicious actors has\nalso been steadily growing — especially since unlike PC botnets, mobile malware does not\nrequire a high level of technical savvy. Together, these factors make for a continually rising\nthreat that now reaches more users than ever, turning them into potential fraud victims.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nX-Force identified the following apps as the malicious BankBot apps that made it into the\nGoogle Play store:\n\n**APK MD5** **Package Name** **Date**\n**Entered**\n**Google**\n**Play**\n\n**1** 34D70B6A2C2B1B07128726499FAC19B1 com.detective.wid 22-Jul-17\n\n**2** 4D51687ADB3B75DD18DD68A70204AE56 com.ak47fl.wid 21-Jul-17\n\n**3** FEFACA64DFE0BF6D7081CBBF6A05CCD5 com.comfl.wid 18-Jul-17\n\n**4** 210B717194C265739F055B9D8BF4F5F2 com.defl.wid 13-Jul-17\n\n**5** 0F996382F01E4502BCA36EF48A87BE86 com.simfl.wid 9-Jul-17\n\n**6** 069BF2F0B21DA3579F7C76EF2B9284D1 com.safarifl.widg 26-Jun-17\n\n\n-----\n\n**APK MD5** **Package Name** **Date**\n**Entered**\n**Google**\n**Play**\n\n**7** 5d68069e8d258c796af5011e27c11423 com.tactflashlight.widget 22-Jun-17\n\n**8** 832ABF77D80FD9A204ABBEB7E7CA9E4A com.spyflashlight.widg 17-Jun-17\n\n**9** F4A0D659C8F7F79D0CD629296CA95478 com.flashdet.widg 17-Jun-17\n\n**10** 3AE09A3D86BC1083A7B67C7827F510B1 com.ledflash.widg 11-Jun-17\n\n**11** 69D0286289A18A2BCF8C1BAFD431B2B7 com.flashmarines.widget 9-Jun-17\n\n**12** A36FA1C70BB238A83547580ED013F8F7 com.flashwar.widg 8-Jun-17\n\n**13** A1007FCB2F238B1A0E63E6B195446086 com.goldflash.widg 7-Jun-17\n\n**14** F16FE16ACD942AA1AF79BE2BD1C1F923 com.goldwidg.flashlight 5-Jun-17\n\n**15** B534F3CA69BBDE1299CCDDDCB3591E5B com.pwidget.flashlight 4-Jun-17\n\n**16** F59D91BCF3CFC8C94E4345C218D9E41C com.eco.fwidget 31-May-17\n\n**17** 9515BA4A7D3E9113402DE9F858E001A4 com.funfl.wid Unknown\n\n**18** 9698340576e27fd11643e6869a192bd0 com.warfl.widget Unknown\n\n**19** DF22128F3C66BCC8074538E47DEC7544 com.flashpolice.widg Unknown\n\n**20** A543A7FE67C99EAC11F5E6B8C5F6B5FB com.flashlight.army Unknown\n\nMost apps have already been removed from the Play store at the time of this writing.
