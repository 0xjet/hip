Tools\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snatch-ransomware-reboots-to-windows-safe-mode-to-bypass-av-tools/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snatch-ransomware-reboots-to-windows-safe-mode-to-bypass-av-tools/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nDecember 9, 2019\n06:08 PM\n0\n\nResearchers discovered a new Snatch ransomware strain that will reboot computers it\ninfects into Safe Mode to disable any resident security solutions and immediately starts\nencrypting files once the system loads.\n\nEncrypting the victim's files is possible because most security tools are automatically\ndisabled when Windows devices boot in Safe Mode as the Sophos Managed Threat\nResponse (MTR) team and SophosLabs researchers found.\n\n\"Snatch can run on most common versions of Windows, from 7 through 10, in 32- and 64bit versions,\" they add. \"The samples we’ve seen are also packed with the open-source\npacker UPX to obfuscate their contents.\"\n\n[Snatch ransomware came out towards the end of 2018 and it became noticeably active](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/702782/snatch-ransomware-support-help-topic-decrypt-extension-datatxt/)\nduring April 2019 as shown by a spike in ransom notes and encrypted file samples\nsubmitted to [Michael Gillespie's](https://twitter.com/demonslay335) [ID Ransomware platform.](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Snatch ransomware 2019 activity (ID Ransomware)**\n\n## Persistence, stealing data, and payload delivery\n\nA suspected member of the Snatch ransomware team was observed by Sophos'\nresearchers while \"looking for affiliate partners with access to\nRDP\\VNC\\TeamViewer\\WebShell\\SQL inj [SQL injection] in corporate networks, stores, and\nother companies.\"\n\nThis hints at the group or its affiliates abusing this type of security holes into organizations'\ncomputing systems, as shown by logs the researchers discovered on one the victims'\nencrypted servers pointing at the threat actors brute-forcing a server's Microsoft Azure\nadmin account and logging in via Remote Desktop (RDP).\n\n\"Subsequent hunts for related files revealed several other attacks in which precisely the\nsame collection of tools was used in what appear to be opportunistic attacks against\norganizations located around the world, including the United States, Canada, and several\n[European countries,\" Sophos says.](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2019/12/09/snatch-ransomware-reboots-pcs-into-safe-mode-to-bypass-protection/)\n\n\"All the organizations where these same files were found also were later discovered to have\none or more computers with RDP exposed to the internet.\"\n\nAfter the initial intrusion, the attackers logged into the domain controller (DC) machine using\nthe same admin account and maintained access, collecting and exfiltrating information, as\nwell as monitoring the victim's network for a few weeks.\n\n**Installing a service to exfiltrate stolen data (Image: Sophos)**\nThey also installed surveillance software on around 5% of all machines on the network\n(roughly 200 computers), which also allowed for remote access making it possible to\nmaintain persistence on the compromised network even if the compromised Azure server\n\n\n-----\n\nwould ve been taken down.\n\n\"The threat actors have also innovated their crime in another important way: one piece of\nmalware used in the Snatch attacks is capable of, and has been, stealing vast amounts of\ninformation from the target organizations,\" Sophos adds.\n\nThe group behind it has also been observed while dropping a series of other tools including\nProcess Hacker, IObit Uninstaller, PowerTool, and PsExec that would also help them\ndisable security tools on devices they compromise.\n\nDropping the Snatch ransomware component payload on the compromised network\nhappens following a seemingly random timeline, in some cases taking just a few days while\nin others it can take weeks.\n\n**Snatch**\n\n**ransomware ransom note sample**\n\n## Disabling anti-malware solutions and encrypting devices\n\nTo take advantage of anti-malware solutions not loading in Safe Mode, the Snatch\nransomware component installs itself as a Windows service dubbed SuperBackupMan\ncapable of running in Safe Mode that can't be stopped or paused, and then force restarts\nthe compromised machine.\n\nAfter the device enters Windows Safe Mode, Snatch ransomware will delete \"all the Volume\nShadow Copies on the system\" as the researchers discovered, preventing \"forensic\nrecovery of the files encrypted by the ransomware.\"\n\nIn the next stage, the malware will start encrypting its victims' files, with the attackers now\nbeing sure that recovery without payment is impossible.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe researchers made a video demo showing one of the Snatch ransomware samples\nrebooting an infected system and encrypting files once the Windows Safe Mode is loaded.\n\nCoveware, a company specialized in intermediating ransomware negotiations, told Sophos\nthat they negotiated with the Snatch team \"on 12 occasions between July and October on\nbehalf of their clients\" with the ransom demands ranging between $2,000 to $35,000 worth\nof bitcoins, going up over those four months.\n\nTo avoid getting breached and infected with Snatch ransomware, companies are advised by\nSophos not to expose RDP services to the Internet or protect them by using a VPN.\n\nSince the group behind this ransomware is also actively looking for affiliates with access to\nexposed VNC and TeamViewer endpoints, as well as with experience in SQL server\nhacking and deploying/using web shells, exposing this type of services could also expose\npotential victims to attacks.\n\nLast but least, Sophos recommends organizations to use multifactor authentication (MFA)\nfor protecting administrator accounts to prevent brute force attacks.\n\nAn extensive list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) including malware sample hashes,\n[exfiltration server addresses, commands used in the attacks, and more, are available
