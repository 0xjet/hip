It is most well-known for being tied_\n_with the Dyre banking trojan, with a peak of over 250,000 Upatre infections per month_\n_delivering Dyre back in July 2015. In November 2015 however, an organization thought_\n_to be associated with the Dyre operation was raided, and subsequently the usage of_\n_Upatre delivering Dyre dropped dramatically, to less than 600 per month by January_\n_2016._\n\n_From PaloAlto Unit42_\n\nFrom 2016 until today I’ve never experienced a new Upatre campaign, or something like\n[that, but something looks to be changed. Analyzing the Cyber Threats Trends findings (for an](https://marcoramilli.com/cyber-threat-trends/)\nupcoming post) I spotted an interesting revival of the Upatre downloader starting from April\n**2020. The following image shows what I mean. Zero Upatre findings until April 21 2020 and**\nalmost 50 single detections per day since that date. Those statistics are so strange to me,\nthat I need to doubt about that. So let’s take a closer look to it and see if there is some\nmisclassification around.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpatre Time Distribution\nDigging a little bit on that samples by asking a second opinion to VirusTotal it looks like\nmatches are genuine. In order to verify that “revival”, I firstly have taken some random\nsamples (with Upatre classification tag) and then verified on VirusTotal the malware\nclassification and the first submission date. Following an example of the performed checks.\nAs you might see from the following picture, 9 AV classified that sample as Upatre, so we\nmight consider not a “false positive” or a “miss-classificated” sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpatre Correct Classification\nThe following image shows the “First Submission Date” which is aligned to what I’ve seen on\n[Cyber Threats Trends. If you take some more samples from the following list (IoC Section)](https://marcoramilli.com/cyber-threat-trends/)\nyou will probably see much more cases similar to that one. I did many checks and I wasn’t\nable to find mismatches at all, so I decided to write up this post about it.\n\nUpatre First Submission\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt’s something very interesting, at least to my understanding, to see an ancient downloader\nbe resumed in such a specific period. Many people starting from April up to today are stuck\nat home performing what has been called “quarantine” due to COVID pandemic. Curiously\nduring the same time, while people are working from home and potentially have much more\nfree time (since they can’t get out home), this older downloader reappears. Maybe somebody\ntook advantage from this bad situation to resurrect some old tools stored in dusty external\nhard-drive ?\n\n## IoC (3384)\n\nFor the complete IoC list check it out: [HERE](https://pastebin.com/ZrCWUU8E)\n\n\n-----",
