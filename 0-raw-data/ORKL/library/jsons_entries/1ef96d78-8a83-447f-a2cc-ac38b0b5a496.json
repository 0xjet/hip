In this article, we dissect the Android version that was](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/)\n[initially analyzed by Lookout in this paper, and we recommend reading it along with this post.](https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/lookout-pegasus-android-technical-analysis.pdf)\nDuring our research about Pegasus for Android, we’ve found out that vendors wrongly\n[attributed some undocumented APK files to Pegasus, as highlighted by a researcher here.](https://twitter.com/maldr0id/status/1492520053702602755)\nWe’ve splitted the analysis into 3 parts because of the code’s complexity and length. We’ve\nalso tried to keep the sections name proposed by Lookout whenever it was possible so that\nanybody could follow the two approaches more easily. In this part, we’re presenting the\ninitialization of the application (including its configuration), the targeted applications, the\ncommands related to the core functionality, and the methods that Pegasus could use to\nremove itself from a device. Our contributions consist of dissecting the application deeper\nthan before and explaining additional functionalities that were identified.\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nSHA256: ade8bef0ac29fa363fc9afd958af0074478aef650adeb0318517b48bd996d5d5\n\nWe’ve performed the analysis using JD-GUI Java Decompiler and Android Studio.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Initial Launch and Configuration**\n\nThe application must obtain an initial configuration from an URL found in the Browser history\nor from a file called “/data/myappinfo” or “/system/ttg”. As we’ll see during the entire analysis,\nthe malware is pretty noisy and logs messages using the Log.i method. Interestingly, the\nauthor mentions the JigglyPuff character from Pokemon in the logging function:\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 2\n\nFirstly, the application tries to parse a config file called “/data/myappinfo” or “/system/ttg” if\nthe first one doesn’t exist:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 4\nThe malware deletes a file called “/data/cksnb.dat” using a binary called “/system/csk”.\nAccording to Lookout, this file is present on devices that were previously rooted. The\npurpose of this binary is to run a command passed as a parameter (such as “rm”) with root\nprivileges:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5\nWhether the process finds one of the configuration files mentioned above, it reads an URL\nthat will be deleted from the Browser history. Some of the settings are Base64-encoded and\nwill be decoded using an implementation of the Base64 algorithm:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6\nThe application reads a token and an “installation” value from the configuration file:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7\nFurthermore, the process reads a configuration value called “local” and another one called\n“userNetwork”, which represents the mobile country code of the victim’s phone:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8\nThe malware reads a configuration value that specifies whether it should communicate with\nthe C2 server while the phone is roaming. The configuration file also contains commands to\nbe executed by Pegasus:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9\nThe version of the installed agent (“packageVersion”) and a value called\n“vulnarbilityIndicator” are also read from the configuration file. The last value is set when\nrequesting an update package, and it would create an mp3 file that exploits the Media Player\non the phone, according to our analysis:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10\nThe agent copies a file called “/data/cksnb.dat” to\n“/data/data/com.network.android/output.mp3”. As also highlighted below, the mp3 file would\nexploit a “vulnarbility” [sic] in Media Player:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11\n\nFigure 12\nA config value called “url address” will be removed from the browser history. The application\nextracts a table containing both bookmarks and history items from\nBrowser.BOOKMARKS_URI:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13\nAs we mentioned before, the application could retrieve the configuration from an URL\ncontaining “rU8IPXbn” found in the Browser history, as highlighted in figure 14.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14\nThe agent parses the target URL and extracts a token (“t=” parameter), a Base64-encoded\ncommand and signature (“&c”), the “installation” value (“&b”), the “userNetwork” configuration\noption (“&d”), and the “windowYuliyus” value (“&r”):\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15\nThe malware expects a valid token and a valid target URL; otherwise, it calls the Log.e\nmethod with the “getSettingsFromBH no valid settings on getSettingsFromHistory” message:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16\nThe agent calls a function that validates the MCC (mobile country code) extracted from the\nconfiguration:\n\nFigure 17\nThe getSubscriberId function is utilized to extract the unique subscriber ID. The first 3 digits\nrepresent the mobile country code (MCC), which is compared with the value extracted from\nthe configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18\nThe application verifies whether the “did_we_restart_after_upgrade_already” value, which\nindicates that the device was rebooted after the installation of Pegasus, is true or false. In the\ncase of no reboot, the application restarts the phone using the “reboot” command:\n\nFigure 19\nFigure 20 reveals how the “/system/csk” binary is used to run commands with root privileges:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20\nThe agent uses a regex to parse the target URL and to extract the IP address and the token,\nas highlighted below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22\nThe process calls a function that deletes the target URL from the Browser history based on\nthe IP address extracted above:\n\nFigure 23\nThe malware starts logging some messages before performing the deletion operation:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24\nThe application retrieves the bookmarks and history items from\n“Browser.BOOKMARKS_URI” and “Browser.HISTORY_PROJECTION”:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25\nThe URL containing “rU8IPXbn” is deleted from the Browser history by calling the\nBrowser.deleteFromHistory function:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26\n\nFigure 27\nThe configuration data is saved in a preference file called “NetworkPreferences” that can be\naccessed using the Android SharedPreferences APIs.\n\n**Targeted Applications**\n\n\n-----\n\n1.

Default Calendar\n\nThe agent extracts the Android version string from the “Build.VERSION.RELEASE” property:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 42\nDepending on the Android version, the calendar’s events can be found at\n“content://com.android.calendar/events” or “content://calendar/events”, as shown in figure\n43:\n\nFigure 43\n\nThe application extracts the events title, summary, description, and other properties (see\nfigure 44). The calendar entries are added to an XmlSerializer object that has multiple\nattributes:\n\nFigure 44\n**Suicide Functionality**\n\n1st method\n\nThe agent will kill itself if it finds a file called “/sdcard/MemosForNotes” on the device:\n\nFigure 45\n\nThe malware starts the removal operation by logging the “removeAppalication start”\nmessage, as shown in the figure below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 46\nThe application removes all files that are located in the “/data/local/tmp/ktmu” directory:\n\nFigure 47\n\nThe SharedPreferences.Editor.clear function is utilized to remove the following preference\nfiles containing configuration data: “NetworkPreferences”, “NetworkWindowAddresess”, and\n“NetworkDataList” (see figure 48).\n\nFigure 48\n\nThe following commands are run by the malware:\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib:/system/lib – set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nenvironment variable\n\n\n-----\n\nmount -o remount,rw /dev/null /system – remount the system directory\n\nforce-stop com.network.android – stop the malicious application\n\ndisable com.network.android – disable the malicious application\n\nrm /system/app/com.media.sync.apk – remove this file\n\npm uninstall com.network.android – uninstall the malicious application\n\nrm /system/ttg – remove the configuration file\n\nchmod 0777 /system/csk; rm /system/csk – delete the binary used to run commands\nwith root privileges (“superuser binary”)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 49\n2nd method\n\nThe malware will also remove itself if it didn’t communicate with the C2 server in the last 60\ndays:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 50\n3rd method\n\nThe suicide functionality is also used when no subscriber ID is identified (see figure 18).\n\n4th method\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Pegasus C2 server can issue a command to the agent in order to remove itself.\n\nPegasus implements 4 main commands that can be executed: dumpCmd, upgradeCmd,\ncamCmd, and emailAttCmd (figure 51).\n\nFigure 51\n\n**dumpCmd command**\n\nThe agent can activate/deactivate some actions depending on the dumpSms,\ndumpWhatsApp, dumpEmails, dumpContacts, dumpCalander [sic], dumpCall boolean\nvalues:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 52\nThe agent extracts the SMS messages sent and received from “content://sms/sent” and\n“content://sms/inbox”. Every SMS is stored in a new XmlSerializer object, as highlighted\nbelow:\n\nFigure 53\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 54\nThe malware extracts the Phone call logs from “CallLog.Calls.CONTENT_URI”. Each log is\nstored in a new XmlSerializer object that contains attributes such as “recordId”, “timestamp”,\n“type”, “number”, “duration”, “isStart”, and “direction”:\n\nFigure 55\n\nFigure 56\n\n\n-----\n\nThe application retrieves the phone contacts from the\n“ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_VCARD_URI” entry. Every contact is stored in an\nXmlSerializer object:\n\nFigure 57\n\nFigure 58\n\nFigure 59\nThe agent obtains a list of application processes running on the device via a call to\ngetRunningAppProcesses:\n\nFigure 60\n\n\n-----\n\nThis command is also responsible for retrieving the information already described in the\n“Targeted applications” section.\n\n**upgradeCmd command**\n\nThe process creates a file called “/data/data/com.network.android/upgrade/uglmt.dat” that\nwill store the upgraded application that is downloaded from the C2 server. It computes the\nMD5 hash of the file and then compares the result with a value that comes with the package:\n\nFigure 61\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 62\nThe agent loads uglmt.dat as a dex file using DexClassLoader and then calls the\n“com.media.provapp.DrivenObjClass.perfU” method with the\n“/data/data/com.network.android/upgrade/intro.mp3” argument:\n\nFigure 63\n\nFigure 64\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter successfully upgrading the agent, the following files are deleted by calling the\nFile.delete function:\n\n/data/data/com.network.android/upgrade/uglmt.dat\n\n/data/data/com.network.android/upgrade/cuvmnr.dat\n\n/data/data/com.network.android/upgrade/zero.mp3\n\n/data/data/com.network.android/upgrade/*com.media.sync*\n\nFigure 65\n**camCmd command**\n\nFirstly, the process relies on a binary that should exist on Android called\n“/system/bin/screencap” in order to take a screenshot of the screen. The result is saved as a\nPNG image at “/data/data/com.network.android/bqul4.dat”:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 66\nSecondly, if the above binary doesn’t exist then the malware will use a resource (found in\nres/raw/ folder) called “take_screen_shot” that will handle the operation. The result is stored\nat “/data/data/com.network.android/tss64.dat”:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 67\nIn any case, the screenshots’ information will be stored in an XmlSerializer object described\nbelow:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 68\nAs we can see in the assembly code of take_screen_shot, the binary captures the Android\nscreen content by reading the “/dev/graphics/fb0” framebuffer that is processed and stored\nas a PNG image:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 69\n\nFigure 70\nThe captured PNG images are compressed to JPG and saved as “ScreenShot-res<Integer><Current Time in seconds>.jpg”:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 71\nThe process can take photos with the front/back camera. It calls the getParameters function\nin order to obtain the current settings for the Camera service and then calls\ngetPreviewFormat:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 72\nDepending on the front/back camera, the taken photo is saved as “Front-res<Integer><Current Time in seconds>.jpg” or “Back-res<Integer>-<Current Time in seconds>.jpg”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 73\n**emailAttCmd command**\n\nThe application creates a database containing a table called “NetworkData” that stores the\nemail attachments’ name and path, as displayed in figure 74.\n\nFigure 74\nThe command’s purpose is to extract a specific email attachment mentioned by the C2\nserver:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 75\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 76\nWe were surprised to find out that during the initialization routine, the threat actor mentioned\nthe “Pegasus” string in a log message:\n\nFigure 77\n\n\n-----",
