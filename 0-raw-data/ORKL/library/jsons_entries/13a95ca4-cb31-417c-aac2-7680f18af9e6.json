He had arrived two days\nahead of a talk he was scheduled to give at a nearby security conference and found that\nthere was no Wi-Fi, and the ethernet jack wasn't working. Downstairs, one of the hotel's staff\ninsisted he wait while a technician was sent up to fix it. Delpy refused, and went back to wait\nin the room instead.\n\nWhen he returned, as Delpy tells it, he was shocked to find the stranger standing at the\nroom's desk, a small black rollerboard suitcase by his side, his fingers hurriedly retracting\nfrom Delpy's keyboard. The laptop still showed a locked Windows login screen.\n\nThe man mumbled an apology in English about his keycard working on the wrong room,\nbrushed past Delpy, and was out the door before Delpy could even react. \"It was all very\nstrange for me,\" Delpy says today. \"Like being in a spy film.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nIt didn t take Delpy long to guess why his laptop had been the target of a literal black bag job.\nIt contained the subject of his presentation at the Moscow conference, an early version of a\nprogram he'd written called Mimikatz. That subtly powerful hacking tool was designed to\nsiphon a Windows user's password out of the ephemeral murk of a computer's memory, so\nthat it could be used to gain repeated access to that computer, or to any others that victim's\naccount could access on the same network. The Russians, like hackers around the world,\nwanted Delpy's source code.\n\nIn the years since, Delpy has released that code to the public, and Mimikatz has become a\nubiquitous tool in all manner of hacker penetrations, allowing intruders to quickly leapfrog\nfrom one connected machine on a network to the next as soon as they gain an initial\nfoothold.\n\nBenjamin Delpy\n\nMost recently, it came into the spotlight as a component of two ransomware worms that have\n[torn through Ukraine and spread across Europe, Russia, and the US: Both NotPetya and](https://www.wired.com/story/petya-ransomware-outbreak-eternal-blue/) last\nmonth's BadRabbit ransomware strains paired Mimikatz with leaked NSA hacking tools to\ncreate automated attacks whose infections rapidly saturated networks, with disastrous\nresults. NotPetya alone led to the paralysis of thousands of computers at companies like\nMaersk, Merck, and FedEx, and is believed to have caused well over a billion dollars in\ndamages.\n\nThose internet-shaking ripples were enabled, at least in part, by a program that Delpy coded\non a lark. An IT manager for a French government institution that he declines to name, Delpy\nsays he originally built Mimikatz as a side project, to learn more about Windows security and\nthe C programming language—and to prove to Microsoft that Windows included a serious\nsecurity flaw in its handling of passwords.\n\nHis proof-of-concept achieved its intended effect: In more recent versions of Windows, the\ncompany changed its authentication system to make Mimikatz-like attacks significantly more\ndifficult. But not before Delpy's tool had entered the arsenal of every resourceful hacker on\nthe planet.\n\n\"Mimikatz wasn’t at all designed for attackers. But it's helped them,\" Delpy says in his\nunderstated and French-tinged English. \"When you create something like this for good, you\nknow it can be used by the bad side too.\"\n\nEven today, despite Microsoft's attempted fixes, Mimikatz remains an all-too-useful hacker\ntool, says Jake Williams, a penetration tester and founder of security firm Rendition Infosec.\n\"When I read a threat intelligence report that says someone used Mimikatz, I say, 'tell me\nabout one that doesn’t,'\" Williams says. \"Everyone uses it, because it works.\"\n\nSecrets for the Taking\n\n\n-----\n\nMimikatz first became a key hacker asset thanks to its ability to exploit an obscure Windows\nfunction called WDigest. That feature is designed to make it more convenient for corporate\nand government Windows users to prove their identity to different applications on their\nnetwork or on the web; it holds their authentication credentials in memory and automatically\nreuses them, so they only have to enter their username and password once.\n\nWhile Windows keeps that copy of the user's password encrypted, it also keeps a copy of the\nsecret key to decrypt it handy in memory, too. \"It’s like storing a password-protected secret in\nan email with the password in the same email,\" Delpy says.\n\nDelpy pointed out that potential security lapse to Microsoft in a message submitted on the\ncompany's support page in 2011. But he says the company brushed off his warning,\nresponding that it wasn't a real flaw. After all, a hacker would already have to gain deep\naccess to a victim's machine before he or she could reach that password in memory.\nMicrosoft said as much in response to WIRED's questions about Mimikatz: \"It’s important to\nnote that for this tool to be deployed it requires that a system already be compromised,\" the\ncompany said in a statement. \"To help stay protected, we recommend customers follow\nsecurity best practices and apply the latest updates.\"\n\n'When you create something like this for good, you know it can be used by the bad\nside, too.'\n\nMimkatz Creator Benjamin Delpy\n\nBut Delpy saw that in practice, the Windows authentication system would still provide a\npowerful stepping stone for hackers trying to expand their infection from one machine to\nmany on a network. If a piece of malware could run with administrative privileges, it could\nscoop up the encrypted password from memory along with the key to decrypt it, then use\nthem to access another computer on the network. If another user was logged into that\nmachine, the attacker could run the same program on the second computer to steal their\npassword—and on and on.\n\nSo Delpy coded Mimikatz—whose name uses the French slang prefix \"mimi,\" meaning\n\"cute,\" thus \"cute cats\"—as a way to demonstrate that problem to Microsoft. He released it\npublicly in May 2011, but as a closed source program. \"Because you don’t want to fix it, I’ll\nshow it to the world to make people aware of it,\" Delpy says of his attitude at the time. \"It\nturns out it takes years to make changes at Microsoft. The bad guys didn’t wait.\"\n\nBefore long, Delpy saw Chinese users in hacker forums discussing Mimikatz, and trying to\nreverse-engineer it. Then in mid-2011, he learned for the first time—he declines to say from\nwhom—that Mimikatz had been used in an intrusion of a foreign government network. \"The\nfirst time I felt very, very bad about it,\" he remembers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat September, Mimikatz was used in the landmark hack of DigiNotar, one of the certificate\nauthorities that assures that websites using HTTPS are who they claim to be. That intrusion\nlet the unidentified hackers issue fraudulent certificates, which were then used to spy on\nthousands of Iranians, according to security researchers at Fox-IT. DigiNotar was blacklisted\n[by web browsers, and subsequently went bankrupt.](https://www.wired.com/2011/09/diginotar-bankruptcy/)\n\nThe Second Russian Man in a Suit\n\nIn early 2012, Delpy was invited to speak about his Windows security work at the Moscow\nconference Positive Hack Days. He accepted—a little naively, still thinking that Mimikatz's\ntricks must have already been known to most state-sponsored hackers. But even after the\nrun-in with the man in his hotel room, the Russians weren't done. As soon as he finished\ngiving his talk to a crowd of hackers in an old Soviet factory building, another man in a dark\nsuit approached him and brusquely demanded he put his conference slides and a copy of\nMimikatz on a USB drive.\n\nDelpy complied. Then, before he'd even left Russia, he published the code open source on\nGithub, both fearing for his own physical safety if he kept the tool's code secret and figuring\nthat if hackers were going to use his tool, defenders should understand it too.\n\nAs the use of Mimikatz spread, Microsoft in 2013 finally added the ability in Windows 8.1 to\ndisable WDigest, neutering Mimikatz's most powerful feature. By Windows 10, the company\nwould disable the exploitable function by default.\n\nBut Rendition's Williams points out that even today, Mimikatz remains effective on almost\nevery Windows machine he encounters, either because those machines run outdated\nversions of the operating system, or because he can gain enough privileges on a victim's\ncomputer to simply switch on WDigest even if it's disabled.\n\n\"My total time-on-target to evade that fix is about 30 seconds,\" Williams says.\n\nIn recent years, Mimikatz has been used in attacks ranging from the Russian hack of the\nGerman parliament to the [Carbanak gang's multimillion dollar bank thefts. But the NotPetya](https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Carbanak_APT_eng.pdf)\nand BadRabbit ransomware outbreaks used Mimikatz in a particularly devious way: They\nincorporated the attacks into self-propagating worms, and combined it with the EternalBlue\nand EternalRomance NSA hacking tools leaked by the hacker group known as Shadow\nBrokers earlier this year.\n\nThose tools allow the malware to spread via Microsoft's Server Message Block protocol to\nany connected system that isn't patched against the attack. And along with Mimikatz, they\nadded up to a tag-team approach that maximizes those automated infections. \"When you\nmix these two technologies, it’s very powerful,\" says Delpy. \"You can infect computers that\naren’t patched, and then you can grab the passwords from those computers to infect other\ncomputers that are patched.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nI think we must be honest: If it wasn t Mimikatz there would be some other tool.\n\nNicholas Weaver, UC Berkeley\n\nDespite those attacks, Delpy hasn't distanced himself from Mimikatz. On the contrary, he has\ncontinued to hone his creation, speaking about it publicly and even adding more features\nover the years. Mimikatz today has become an entire utility belt of Windows authentication\ntricks, from stealing hashed passwords and passing them off as credentials, to generating\nfraudulent \"tickets\" that serve as identifying tokens in Microsoft's Kerberos authentication\nsystem, to stealing passwords from the auto-populating features in Chrome and Edge\nbrowsers. Mimikatz today even includes a feature to cheat in Windows' Minesweeper game,\npulling out the location of every mine in the game from the computer's memory.\n\nDelpy says that before adding a feature that exploits any serious new security issue in\nWindows, he does alert Microsoft, sometime months in advance. Still, it has grown into quite\nthe repository.\n\n\"It's my toolbox, where I put all of my ideas,\" Delpy says.\n\nA Bitter Password-Protection Pill\n\nEach of those features—the Minesweeper hack included—is intended not to enable criminals\nand spies but to demonstrate Windows' security quirks and weaknesses, both in the way it's\nbuilt and the way that careless corporations and governments use it. After all, Delpy says, if\nsystems administrators limit the privileges of their users, Mimikatz can't get the administrative\naccess it needs to start hopping to other computers and stealing more credentials. And the\n[Shadow Brokers' leak from the NSA in fact revealed that the agency had its own Mimikatz-](https://twitter.com/TalBeerySec/status/854333710010896388)\nlike program for exploiting WDigest—though it's not clear which came first.\n\n\"If Mimikatz has been used to steal your passwords, your main problem is not Mimikatz,\"\nDelpy says.\n\nMimikatz is nonetheless \"insanely powerful,\" says UC Berkeley security researcher Nicholas\nWeaver. But he says that doesn't mean Delpy should be blamed for the attacks it's helped to\nenable. \"I think we must be honest: If it wasn't Mimikatz there would be some other tool,\"\nsays Weaver. \"These are fundamental problems present in how people administer large\ngroups of computers.\"\n\nAnd even as thieves and spies use Mimikatz again and again, the tool has also allowed\npenetration testers to unambiguously show executives and bureaucrats their flawed security\narchitectures, argues Rendition security's Williams. And it has pressured Microsoft to slowly\nalter the Windows authentication architecture to fix the flaws Mimikatz exploits. \"Mimikatz\nhas done more to advance security than any other tool I can think of,\" Williams says.\n\n\n-----\n\nEven Microsoft seems to have learned to appreciate Delpy s work. He s spoken at two of the\ncompany's Blue Hat security conferences, and this year was invited to join one of its review\nboards for new research submissions. As for Delpy, he has no regrets about his work. Better\nto be hounded by Russian spies than to leave Microsoft's gaping vulnerability a secret for\nthose spies alone to exploit.\n\n\"I created this to show Microsoft this isn't a theoretical problem, that it’s a real problem,\" he\nsays. \"Without real data, without dangerous data, they never would have done anything to\nchange it.\"\n\n\n-----",
