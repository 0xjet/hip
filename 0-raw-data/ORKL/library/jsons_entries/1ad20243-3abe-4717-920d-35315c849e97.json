The Lazarus Group is composed of at\n[least two subgroups, both known as Andariel and](https://www.attackiq.com/2022/12/22/emulating-the-politically-motivated-north-korean-adversary-andariel/) [BlueNoroff, and has notable overlaps with](https://www.attackiq.com/2022/12/14/emulating-the-financially-motivated-north-korean-adversary-bluenoroff/)\nthe adversaries known as APT37 and Kimsuky.\n\nLazarus Group’s main motivations are theft of proprietary information, espionage, sabotage,\n[and destruction. The group first came to media attention in 2013, following a series of](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html)\ncoordinated attacks against South Korean media and financial entities using the wiper known\nas [DarkSeoul.](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/03/20/south-korea-cyber-attack/)\n\nTheir most notorious campaign occurred in November 2014 when the Lazarus Group\nconducted a large-scale destructive attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE),\nwhich was notable due to the substantial penetration through the network, the large amount\nof exfiltrated data, and the use of a wiper to erase all forensic evidence.\n\nAttackIQ has released six new attack graphs emulating the actor’s historical campaigns to\nhelp customers validate their security controls and their ability to defend against this group.\nValidating your security program performance against these behaviors is vital to reducing\n\n\n-----\n\nrisk. By using these new attack graphs in the AttackIQ Security Optimization Platform,\nsecurity teams will be able to:\n\nEvaluate security control performance against the top North Korean threat actor who\nhas targeted all regions and sectors.\nAssess their security posture against a threat actor who is not afraid to commit\ndestructive actions.\nContinuously validate detection and prevention pipelines against the techniques shared\namongst many of the North Korean adversaries.\n\n## Lazarus Group – 2018-12 – Operation Sharpshooter\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\n[The first attack graph is based on Operation Sharpshooter reported by McAfee in December](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-sharpshooter-targets-global-defense-critical-infrastructure/)\n2018. Operation Sharpshooter took place between October and November 2018 against\nmore than 80 organizations worldwide, predominantly those located in the United States.\nDuring this attack, the adversary focused on targeting multiple sectors, specifically those\ninvolved in finance, energy, and defense.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nThe attack graph begins with the downloading and saving of the malicious Office Document\nused for the deployment of the Rising Sun implant, which obtains persistence through the\nStartup folder.\n\n**[Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105): This scenario downloads to memory and saves to disk in](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)**\ntwo separate scenarios to test network and endpoint controls and their ability to prevent the\ndelivery of known malicious samples of Lazarus malware. These scenarios are used for each\nstage of the malware delivered in these attacks.\n\n**[Logon Autostart Execution: Startup Folder (T1547.001): The Startup folder is a directory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)**\nassociated with the Windows Start Menu that can be used to launch a process at Windows\nlogon. This scenario creates a binary file in this directory that would execute at next logon for\nusers.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nDuring the second stage, the graph seeks to collect information from various sources about\nthe system environment prior to the exfiltration of the encrypted collected data.\n\n**[File and Directory Discovery (T1083): This scenario uses the native dir command to find](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)**\nfiles of interest and output to a temporary file.\n\n**[System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016): Native Window’s commands like](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016)**\n```\nroute, ipconfig, and net use are executed to collect details about the infected host and\n\n```\nnetwork shares.\n\n**[System Owner / User Discovery (T1033): Living off the land by running whoami and users](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/)**\nto gain details about the currently available accounts and permission groups.\n\n**[System Information Discovery (T1082): The native hostname and systeminfo commands](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082)**\nare used to get the infected host’s computer name and basic details about the system.\n\n**[Query Registry (T1012): The HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012)**\nregistry key contains information about Windows properties for the user account logged into\nthe system.\n\n**[Data Staged: Local Data Staging (T1074.001): Files are collected and stored in a](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001/)**\ntemporary directory so they can be exfiltrated later\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol (T1048.001): Files are first](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/001)**\nencrypted using AES encryption and then transmitted over HTTPS using POST requests.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nIn the last stage, the implant seeks to obtain in-depth information about the files contained in\nthe system and peripheral devices, finalizing with the communication to the adversary’s\ninfrastructure.\n\n**[Process Discovery (T1057):](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)** `tasklist is executed as a command process and the results`\nare saved to a temporary location.\n\n**[System Information Discovery (T1082): The native Windows commands logicaldisk and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082)**\n```\ndiskdrive are executed to collect information about the installed disks, including caption,\n\n```\ndescription, drive type, provider name, and size.\n\n**[Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols (T1071.001): This scenario emulates the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)**\nHTTP requests made by the Rising Sun backdoor by making an HTTP POST to an AttackIQ\nserver that mimics the URL format and data sent by a real infection.\n\n## Lazarus Group – 2020-06 – Operation In(ter)ception\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\n[The second attack graph is based on the Operation In(ter)ception report by ESET published](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ESET_Operation_Interception.pdf)\nin June 2020. Operation In(ter)ception was a campaign conducted against military and\naerospace organizations in Europe and the Middle East. The actor used social engineering\nvia LinkedIn, hiding behind the ruse of attractive, but bogus, job offers.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nThe attack graph begins with the downloading and saving of a malicious LNK file, which\nseeks to evade defenses by masquerading as a legitimate process when executed. Next, the\ngraph seeks to obtain persistence through a scheduled task and executes a remote XSL\nscript. The first-stage downloader is downloaded, saved, and executed as a new service.\n\n**[Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location (T1036.005): A copy of the legitimate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/)**\n```\nwmic.exe binary is placed in a temporary directory.

This\nfunctionality allows an actor to deploy a malicious DLL and have a native Windows tool\nexecute the code as the parent process. This scenario executes RegSvr32 with an AttackIQ\nbinary.\n\n**[System Network Connections Discovery (T1049): The native Windows command line tool](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1049)**\n```\nnetstat is used to collect active connections and any listening services running on the host.\n\n## Lazarus Group – 2020-08 – Operation Dream Job (ClearSky)\n\n```\n(Click for Larger)\n\n[This attack graph emulates the first iteration of the Operation Dream Job, reported by](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dream-Job-Campaign.pdf)\nClearSky in August 2020. Operation Dream Job was a cyberattack carried out against\nmultiple individuals worldwide from early 2020 to mid-2022. The actors used social media to\nphish victims in the defense sector and various government organizations leveraging fake\njob offers from prominent defense and aerospace companies.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nThe attack graph begins with the downloading and saving of a malicious Office document,\nwhich obtains persistence through the Startup folder, using a dropped LNK shortcut file.\nSubsequently the DBLL Loader is downloaded and saved to the system which is executed\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough RunDLL32 and to complete the deployment of the final payload known as\nDRATzarus.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nIn the last stage, after downloading and saving DRATzarus to the system, the attack graph\nrecreates the communications captured between the malware sample and the adversary’s\ninfrastructure, ending with the collection of the network connections available in the system\nand obtaining credentials from the browser through LaZagne.\n\n**[OS Credential Dumping (T1003): This scenario uses the open-source tool LaZagne to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003)**\ndump credentials available on the host including the saved browser passwords.\n\n## Lazarus Group – 2022-04 – Operation Dream Job (Symantec)\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nThe next attack graph continues to emulate the second iteration of the Dream Job operation,\nthis time from activity [reported by Symantec in April 2022.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/lazarus-dream-job-chemical)\n\n\n-----\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nThe attack graph starts by downloading and saving a trojanized version of the ComparePlus\nplugin DLL, which is a Notepad++ plugin used to compare two files and show differences\nside by side. After being executed via RunDLL32, the attack graph will seek to inject code\ninto an active process.\n\n**[Process Injection (T1055): This scenario injects a DLL file into another running process and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)**\nvalidates if a canary file can be created.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nSubsequently, it will attempt to perform lateral movement by using Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI), continuing with obtaining credentials through the registry or by\ndumping of the SAM database, and finishing with obtaining persistence through a scheduled\ntask.\n\n**[Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047): This scenario uses wmic commands to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)**\nexecute commands on a remote target.\n\n**[Unsecured Credentials: Credentials in Registry (T1552.002): A PowerShell script is](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/002)**\nexecuted that searches for DefaultPassword and AltDefaultPassword registry keys that\ncontain hard-coded credentials.\n\n**[OS Credential Dumping: Security Account Manager (T1003.002): The built-in reg save](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/002)**\ncommand is executed to dump the Windows SAM hive.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nIn the last stage, the attack graph will try to obtain information about the active network\nconnections and drop their tool known as SiteShooter. Finally, it will collect information about\nthe infected environment, ending up obtaining the system network configuration.\n\n## Lazarus Group – 2021-01 – ThreatNeedle Campaign\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nThe ThreatNeedle campaign was a cyberattack against security researchers and the\n[defense industry from mid-2020 to early 2021 reported by Kaspersky. During this attack,](https://securelist.com/lazarus-threatneedle/100803/)\nLazarus made use of the malware family known as ThreatNeedle, which is based on the\nManuscrypt family. The group leveraged COVID-19-themed emails, personalizing them with\npersonal information obtained during an initial reconnaissance effort.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nThe attack graph begins with obtaining persistence through the Startup folder and\nimmediately continues with the deployment of the ThreatNeedle Loader, which seeks to\ncreate a new service to load the ThreatNeedle backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Modify Registry (T1112): This scenario sets the same registry key used by the actor by](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)**\ncalling the New-ItemProperty cmdlet.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nIn the last stage, the attack graph will seek to collect system information, obtain credentials,\nand move laterally through the victim network, ending with tunneling an SSH connection to\nexternal infrastructure.\n\n**[OS Credential Dumping (T1003): This scenario uses the open-source tool MimiKatz to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003)**\ndump all possible credentials available on the host.\n\n**[System Service Discovery (T1007): Microsoft’s native sc utility is executed to query a list of](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007)**\nall running services.\n\n**[Protocol Tunneling (T1572): This scenario tests security controls responsible for blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572)**\noutbound SSH connections to external servers.\n\n## Lazarus Group – 2022-07 – MagicRAT + TigerRAT Campaign\n\n\n-----\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\n[The sixth and final attack graph seeks to emulate the activity reported by Cisco Talos in](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-magicrat/)\nSeptember 2022. During this activity, researchers observed the compromise of victims with a\nnew Remote Access Trojan they named MagicRAT delivered by exploiting publicly exposed\nVMWare Horizon platforms. During this activity, Lazarus Group additionally used TigerRAT, a\nmalware previously attributed to the Andariel adversary during Operation ByteTiger in\nSeptember 2021.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attack graph starts with the deployment of MagicRAT immediately after the exploitation\nof vulnerabilities present in VMWare Horizon platforms. During this first stage, MagicRAT will\nseek to obtain persistence using a scheduled task or the Startup folder prior to checking in\nand registering with the actor’s infrastructure.\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nIn the second stage of the attack, the actor completes some basic discovery commands\nbefore attempting to quickly exfiltrate some files of interest.\n\n**[Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041): Files are sent to an AttackIQ controlled server using](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)**\n```\nHTTP POST requests.\n\n```\n(Click for Larger)\n\nIn the next stage, Lazarus Group uses a lightweight port scanner to obtain information about\nthe open ports available on other systems located in the infected host’s local network. The\nactor continues to stage data it discovers for delivery on the next check-in with the\ncommand-and-control server.\n\n**[Network Service Discovery (T1046): This scenario uses nmap for scanning hosts that are](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046)**\nopen on ports 139,389,445,636,3389 that would identify remotely accessible hosts to the\nattacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Click for Larger)\n\nTigerRAT, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) previously used during Operation ByteTiger first\n[reported by the KrCERT, is deployed.

All of the data collected during the attack is exfiltrated to the actor’s\ninfrastructure.\n\n**[Data from Removable Media (T1025): The native utility fsutil is used to identify any](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1025)**\nadditional hard disks connected to the host. PowerShell is then used to iterate through every\nremovable media device and harvest a list of files.\n\n### Detection and Mitigation Opportunities\n\nWith so many different techniques being used by threat actors, it can be difficult to know\nwhich to prioritize for prevention and detection assessment. AttackIQ recommends first\nfocusing on the following techniques emulated in our scenarios before moving on to the\nremaining techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacks from the Lazarus Group are long drawn-out campaigns that require the actor to\ncollect data and infiltrate the victim over time. One of best ways to limit the actor’s ability to\nlive in your network is to scrutinize the persistence mechanisms used by the group.\n\n**[1. Windows Service (T1543.003)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/)**\n\nActors can create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as\npart of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called\nservices that perform background system functions.\n\n1a. Detection\n\nThe following rules can help identify when that persistence mechanism is being set.\n```\nProcess Name == (Cmd.exe OR Powershell.exe)\nCommand Line CONTAINS (‘sc’ AND ‘create’ AND ‘start= “auto”’)\n\n```\n1b. Mitigation\n\nMITRE ATT&CK has the following mitigation recommendations\n\n**[2. Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task (T1053.005)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)**\n\nAdversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or\nrecurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler\nin Windows. The [schtasks utility can be run directly from the command line, or the Task](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111)\nScheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the\nControl Panel.\n\n2a. Detection\n\nWith an EDR or SIEM Platform, you can detect the following commands being issued to\nschedule a malicious task\n```\nProcess Name = (“cmd.exe” OR “Powershell.exe”)\nCommand Line CONTAINS (“schtasks” AND “/CREATE” AND (“cmd” OR “powershell”)\n\n```\n2b. Mitigation\n\nMITRE ATT&CK has the following mitigation recommendations\n\n**[3. Startup Folder (T1547.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)**\n\nEach user profile has their own StartUp directory and there is also an additional directory\nthat applies to all folders. Actors may place binaries and scripts in here directly or they can\nplace shortcut LNK files that can point to a file to be executed.\n\n3a. Detection\n\n\n-----\n\nWith an EDR or SIEM Platform, you can identify processes originating from the StartUp\ndirectory and later add exclusions for known legitimate processes specific to your\nenvironment.\n```\nCommand Line CONTAINS (“StartUp”)\n\n```\n3b. Mitigation\n\nMITRE ATT&CK does not have any mitigation recommendations as this is an abuse of\nsystem features. Auditing and Process Logging are the best options.\n\n## Wrap-up\n\nIn summary, these attack graphs will evaluate security and incident response processes and\nsupport the improvement of your security control posture against one of the most dangerous\nthreat actors in the world today. With data generated from continuous testing and use of\nthese attack graphs, you can focus your teams on achieving key security outcomes, adjust\nyour security controls, and work to elevate your total security program effectiveness against\na known and dangerous threat.\n\nAttackIQ stands at the ready to help security teams implement this attack graph and other\naspects of the AttackIQ Security Optimization Platform, including through our co-managed\n[security service, AttackIQ Vanguard.](https://attackiq.com/platform/attackiq-vanguard/)\n\n\n-----",
