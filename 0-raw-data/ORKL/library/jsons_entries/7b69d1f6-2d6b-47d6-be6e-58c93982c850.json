    "plain_text": "# Bitter APT adds Bangladesh to their targets\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/bitter-apt-adds-bangladesh-to-their.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/bitter-apt-adds-bangladesh-to-their.html)**\n\nCisco Talos has observed an ongoing malicious campaign since August 2021 from\nthe Bitter APT group that appears to target users in Bangladesh, a change from the\nattackers' usual victims.\nAs part of this, there's a new trojan based on Apost Talos is calling \"ZxxZ,\" that,\namong other features, includes remote file execution capability.\nBased on the similarities between the C2 server in this campaign with that of Bitter's\nprevious campaign, we assess with moderate confidence that this campaign is\noperated by the Bitter APT group.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nCisco Talos discovered an ongoing campaign operated by what we believe is the Bitter\nAPT group since August 2021. This campaign is a typical example of the actor targeting\nSouth Asian government entities.\n\nThis campaign targets an elite unit of the Bangladesh's government with a themed lure\ndocument alleging to relate to the regular operational tasks in the victim's organization.\nThe lure document is a spear-phishing email sent to high-ranking officers of the Rapid\nAction Battalion Unit of the Bangladesh police (RAB). The emails contain either a\nmalicious RTF document or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet weaponized to exploit known\nvulnerabilities. Once the victim opens the maldoc, the Equation Editor application is\nautomatically launched to run the embedded objects containing the shellcode to exploit\nknown vulnerabilities described by CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798 and CVE-20180802 — all in Microsoft Office — then downloads the trojan from the hosting server and\nruns it on the victim's machine. The trojan masquerades as a Windows Security update\n\n\n-----\n\nservice and allows the malicious actor to perform remote code execution, opening the\ndoor to other activities by installing other tools. In this campaign, the trojan runs itself\nbut the actor has other RATs and downloaders in their arsenal.\n\nSuch surveillance campaigns could allow the threat actors to access the organization's\nconfidential information and give their handlers an advantage over their competitors,\nregardless of whether they're state-sponsored.\n\n## Bitter threat actor\n\nBitter, also known as T-APT-17, is a suspected South Asian threat actor. They have been\nactive since 2013, targeting energy, engineering and government sectors in China,\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia. In their latest campaign, they have extended their targeting to\nBangladeshi government entities.\n\nBitter is mainly motivated by espionage. The adversary typically downloads malware onto\ncompromised endpoints from their hosting server via HTTP and uses DNS to establish\ncontact with the command and control. Bitter is known for exploiting known\nvulnerabilities in victims' environments. For example, in 2021, security researchers\n[discovered that the adversary was exploiting the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2021-28310,](https://securelist.com/zero-day-vulnerability-in-desktop-window-manager-cve-2021-28310-used-in-the-wild/101898/)\na security flaw in Microsoft's Desktop Manager. Bitter is known to target both mobile and\ndesktop platforms. Their arsenal mainly contains Bitter RAT, Artra downloader,\nSlideRAT and AndroRAT.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe actor's infrastructure consists of the C2 server (helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com) and\nseveral domains that host the adversary's malware, which is outlined below.\n\n_Domains hosting Bitter APT malware._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SSL thumbprints are unique for each domain's certificate. We compiled a list of these\nSSL thumbprints in the IOCs section of the report. The timeline below shows the various\ndomains based on their certificate creation date.\n\nThe C2 host is helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com. Its WhoIs record indicates that the\ndomain autodefragapp[.]com registered it in November 2020, and later updated it on\nNov. 3, 2021. We have seen the actor use this C2 in previous campaigns.\n\nThe C2 domain resolved to 99[.]83[.]154[.]118 during the period of the campaign. This is\n[a legitimate IP address for the AWS Global Accelerator networking service. Usually, the](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/?blogs-global-accelerator.sort-by%3Ditem.additionalFields.createdDate%26blogs-global-accelerator.sort-order%3Ddesc%26aws-global-accelerator-wn.sort-by%3Ditem.additionalFields.postDateTime%26aws-global-accelerator-wn.sort-order%3Ddesc)\nAWS Global Accelerator provides static IPs to the registrant, which allows the user to\nredirect traffic to their application or host for improved performance. In this case, we\nbelieve that the actor is using the AWS Global Accelerator to redirect traffic to their actual\nC2 host, which is parked behind the legitimate AWS service. We believe that the actor has\nemployed this technique to conceal their identity.\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that this campaign is operated by Bitter based on the\nuse of the same C2 IP address from previous campaigns and similarities in the decrypted\nstrings of the payload, such as module names, payload executable name, paths and the\nconstants.\n\nThe 99[.]83[.]154[.]118 IP also hosts mswsceventlog[.]net, according to Cisco Umbrella, a\n[domain that was previously reported as Bitter's C2 server in a campaign against Pakistani](https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/259453)\ngovernment organizations.\n\n## The campaign\n\nCisco Talos observed an ongoing campaign operated by the Bitter APT group since August\n2021 targeting Bangladeshi government personnel with spear-phishing emails. The email\ncontains a maldoc attachment and masquerades as a legitimate email. The sender asks\nthe target to review or verify the attached maldoc, which is either a call data record\n(CDR), a list of phone numbers, or a list of registered cases. We have seen the actor use\nthese themes in phishing emails in the past.\n\nThe maldocs are an RTF document and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Examples of the\nspecific subjects of the phishing emails are below.\n\nSubject: CDR\nSubject: Application for CDR\nSubject: List of Numbers to be verified\nSubject: List of registered cases\n\nThe maldocs' file names are consistent with the phishing emails' themes, as seen in the\nlist of file names below:\n\nPassport Fee Dues.xlsx\nList of Numbers to be verified.xlsx\nASP AVIJIT DAS.doc\n\n\n-----\n\nAddl SP Hafizur Rahman.doc\nAddl SP Hafizur Rahman.xlsx\nRegistered Cases List.xlsx\n\nBelow are two spear-phishing email samples of this campaign.\n\n_Phishing email sample 1_\n\n_Phishing email sample 2_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actor is using JavaMail with the Zimbra web client version 8.8.15_GA_4101 to send\nthe emails. Zimbra is a collaborative software suite that includes an email server and a\nweb client for messaging.\n\n_Phishing email header information._\n\nThe originating IP address and header information indicates the emails were sent from\nmail servers based in Pakistan and the actor spoofed the sender details to make the email\nappear as though it was sent from Pakistani government organizations. The actor\nexploited a possible vulnerability in the Zimbra mail server. By modifying the Zimbra\nmail server configuration file, a user can send emails from a non-existing email\naccount/domain. We have compiled a list of fake sender email addresses from this\ncampaign:\n\ncdrrab13bd@gmail[.]com\narc@desto[.]gov[.]pk\nso.dc@pc[.]gov[.]pk\nmem_psd@pc[.]gov[.]pk\nchief_pia@pc[.]gov[.]pk\nrab3tikatuly@gmail[.]com\nddscm2@pof[.]gov[.]pk\n\n## The infection chain\n\nThe infection chain begins with the spear-phishing email and either a malicious RTF\ndocument or an Excel spreadsheet attachment. When the victim opens the attachment, it\nlaunches the Microsoft Equation Editor application to execute the equations in the form\nof OLE objects and connects to the hosting server to download and run the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Malicious RTF infection chain summary._\nIn the case of a malicious Excel spreadsheet, when the victim opens the file, it launches\nthe Microsoft Equation Editor application to execute the embedded equation object and\nlaunches the task scheduler to configure two scheduled tasks. One of the scheduled tasks\ndownloads the trojan \"ZxxZ\" into the public user's account space, while the other task\nruns the \"ZxxZ\".\n\n_Malicious Excel infection chain summary._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload runs as a Windows security update service on the victim's machine and\nestablishes communication with the C2 to remotely download and execute files in the\nvictim's environment.\n\n## RTF document\n\nThe Malicious RTF document is weaponized to exploit the stack overflow vulnerability\nCVE-2017-11882, which enables arbitrary code execution on victims' machines running\n[vulnerable versions of Microsoft Office. Our previous blog outlines how this particular](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/10/old-dog-new-tricks-analysing-new-rtf_15.html)\nexploit works in the victim's environment.\n\n_Malicious RTF document sample._\nThe RTF document is embedded with an OLE object with the class name \"Equation 3.0.\"\nIt contains the shellcode as an equation formula created using Microsoft Equation Editor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Embedded Microsoft Equation object._\nWhen the victim opens the RTF file with Microsoft Word, it invokes the Equation Editor\napplication and executes the equation formula containing the Return-Oriented\nProgramming (ROP) gadgets. The ROP loads and executes the shell code located at the\nend of the maldocs in an encrypted format that connects to the malicious host\nolmajhnservice[.]com and downloads the payload from the URL\nhxxp[:]//olmajhnservice[.]/nxl/nx. The payload is downloaded in the folder\n\"C:\\$Utf&quot created by the shellcode and runs as a process on the victim's machine.\n\n_Download URL captured during runtime of the maldoc._\n\n## Excel spreadsheet\n\nThe malicious Excel spreadsheet is weaponized to exploit the Microsoft Office memory\ncorruption vulnerabilities CVE-2018-0798 and CVE-2018-0802.\n\nWhen the victim opens the Excel spreadsheet, it launches the Microsoft Equation Editor\napplication to execute the embedded Microsoft Equation 3.0 objects.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Malicious Excel spreadsheet._\n\nOnce the Microsoft Equation Editor service executes the embedded objects, it invokes the\nscheduled task service to configure the task scheduler with the commands shown below:\n\nTask 1: Rdx\n\nTask 2: RdxFac\n\nThe actor creates the folder \"RdxFact '' in the Windows tasks folder and schedules two\ntasks with the task names \"Rdx '' and \"RdxFac '' to run every five minutes. When the first\ntask runs, the victim's machine attempts to connect to the hosting server through the URL\nand, using the cURL utility, downloads the \"RdxFactory.exe\" into the public user profile's\nmusic folder. RdxFactory.exe is the trojan downloader.\n\nAfter five minutes of execution of the first task, \"Rdx,\", the second task, \"RdxFac,\"runs to\nstart the payload.\n\nBased on other related samples we discovered, the actor also uses different folder names,\ntasks names and dropper file names in their campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe noticed that the actor is using the cURL command-line utility to download the\npayload in the Windows environment. Systems running Windows 10 and later have the\ncURL utility, which the actor abuses in this campaign.\n\n## The payload\n\nThe payload is a 32-bit Windows executable compiled in Visual C++ with a timestamp of\nSept. 10, 2021. We named the trojan \"ZxxZ\" based on the name of a separator that the\npayload uses while sending information to the C2. This trojan is a downloader that\ndownloads and executes the remote file. The executables were seen with the filenames\n\"Update.exe\", \"ntfsc.exe\" or \"nx\" in this campaign. They are either downloaded or\ndropped into the victim's \"local application data\" folder and run as a Windows Security\nupdate with medium integrity to elevate the privileges of a standard user.\n\nThe actor uses common encoding techniques to obfuscate strings in the WinMain\nfunction to hide its behavior from static analysis tools.\n\n_WinMain function snippet._\nThe decryption function receives the encrypted strings and decrypts each character with\nthe XOR operation and stores the result in an array that will be returned to the caller\nfunction.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decryption function._\nThe malware searches for the Windows Defender and Kaspersky antivirus processes in\nthe victim's machine by creating the snapshot of running processes using\nCreateToolhelp32Snapshot and iterates through each process using API Process32First\nand Process32Next.\n\n\n-----\n\n_WinMain() snippet showing antivirus process detection._\nThe information-gathering function gathers the victim's hostname, operating system\nproduct name, and the victim's username and writes them into a memory buffer.\n\n_Information-gathering function._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 communicating function at offset 401C50 is called from the two other requests\nmaking functions to send the victim's information with the decrypted strings\n\"xnb/dxagt5avbb2.php?txt=\" and \"data1.php?id=\" to C2 and receive the response.\n\nThe received response is a remote file saved into the \"debug\" folder and executed with the\nAPI \"ShellExecuteA\". In our research debugging environment, the remote file is similar to\nthe trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Requests making function 1 at offset 00401E00._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Requests making function 2 at offset 00402130._\n\n## C2 communication\n\nFor C2 communication, first, the trojan sends the victim's computer name, user name, a\nseparator \"ZxxZ\" and the Windows version pulled from the registry. The server responds\nback with data in the format <id><user>:\"<Program name\">.\n\nNext, the malware requests the program data. The server sends back the data of the\nPortable Executable effectively matching the pattern:<zero or more bytes>ZxxZ<PE data\nminus the MZ>. It then saves the file to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Debug\\<program\nname>.exe and tries to execute it.\n\n_Request sent to C2._\nIf the download is successful, the server sends back the request with the opcode DN-S\nand, in case of a failure, the opcode RN_E in their response. Based on our analysis, the\nopdoce DN-S means \"download successful\" and RN_E stands for run error. If failed, the\nmalware attempts to download the program data 225 times, and after that, it will launch\nitself and exit.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations should be vigilant about the highly motivated threat actors who are known\nto conduct targeted attacks in their region. Threat actors usually emerge with smart\ntechniques to accomplish their adversarial objectives and we have seen such an attempt\nin this campaign with the addition of a new variant to their arsenal.\n\nIn this current campaign, upon compromising the victim's machine and implanting the\ntrojan ZxxZ - which has remote file execution capability - the adversary can deploy and\nrun other tools from their arsenal to achieve their malicious objective.\n\nOrganizations should have a layered defense strategy with the implementation of the\nlatest detection rules and behavioral protections in their endpoint defense solutions - not\nonly with technical controls, but the organizations should have matured incident\nresponse plans and have the organization's security posture streamlined to protect their\nenvironment against the latest threats.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
