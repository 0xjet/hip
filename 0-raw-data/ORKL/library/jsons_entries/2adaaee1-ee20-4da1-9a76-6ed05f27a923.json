It is fairly elemental malicious code\nbased on an old RAT known as [njRAT, it implements common spying features such as](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37430/cyber-crime/njrat-campaign-fakeav.html)\nkeylogger, webcam hijacker, screen capturing and of course the ability to execute attackers’\ncode on the victim’s system.\n\n_“The Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team has been monitoring a new remote access Trojan_\n_(RAT) family called Cobian RAT since February 2017. The RAT builder for this family was_\n_first advertised on multiple underground forums where cybercriminals often buy and sell_\n_[exploit and malware kits.” reads the analysis from Zscaler. “This RAT builder caught our](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cobian-rat-backdoored-rat)_\n_attention as it was being offered for free and had lot of similarities to the njRAT/H-Worm_\n_[family, which we analyzed in this report.”](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/njrat-h-worm-variant-infections-continue-rise)_\n\nUnfortunately, the Cobain RAT hides a malicious feature in an encrypted library, the code\nallows the author of the malware to take full control of machines infected with the RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code could be used by the author also to completely cut off the crooks who initially\ninfected the machine with the Cobain RAT.\n\nThe malware researchers noticed that the backdoor module hidden in the Cobian builder kit\ncommunicates with a preset page on Pastebin that was managed by the original author. In\nthis way, the malware gets the current address of the command and control servers run by\nthe original writer, but it first checks for the presence of the second level operator online to\navoid being detected.\n\nThe experts speculate the original author’s purpose is to build a massive botnet exploiting\nthe effort of second operators in spreading the Cobian RAT.\n\n_“It is ironic to see that the second level operators, who are using this kit to spread malware_\n_and steal from the end user, are getting duped themselves by the original author. The original_\n_author is essentially using a crowdsourced model for building a mega Botnet that leverages_\n_the second level operators Botnet.” concluded. “The original author is essentially using a_\n_crowdsourced model for building a mega Botnet that leverages the second level operators’_\n_Botnet.”_\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(Security Affairs – Cobian RAT, malware)](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)**\n\nShare On\n\n\n-----\n\nYou might also like\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n**[GhostTouch: how to remotely control touchscreens with EMI](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131714/hacking/ghosttouch-touchscreens-attack.html)**\n\nMay 27, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n\n\n-----\n\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
