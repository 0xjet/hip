Since they first emerged back in 2007 with a series of\ncyberespionage attacks against the South Korean government, these threat actors have successfully\nmanaged to pull off some of the most notable and devastating targeted attacks—such as the widely[reported 2014 Sony hack and the 2016 attack on a Bangladeshi bank—in recent history.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/the-hack-of-sony-pictures-what-you-need-to-know)\n[Throughout the Lazarus group’s operational history, few threat actors have managed to match the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/a-look-into-the-lazarus-groups-operations)\ngroup in terms of both scale and impact, due in large part to the wide variety of tools and tactics at\nthe group’s disposal.\n\nThe malware known as RATANKBA is just one of the weapons in Lazarus’ arsenal. This malicious\n[software, which could have been active since late 2016, was used in a recent campaign targeting](https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers/)\n[financial institutions using watering hole attacks. The variant used during these attacks](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/137/watering-hole-101)\n[(TROJ_RATANKBA.A) delivered multiple payloads that include hacking tools and software](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/TROJ_RATANKBA.A)\ntargeting banking systems. We analyzed a new RATANKBA variant (BKDR_RATANKBA.ZAEL–\nA), discovered in June 2017, that uses a PowerShell script instead of its more traditional PE\n[executable form—a version that other researchers also recently identified.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67090/apt/lazarus-apt-interest-cryptocurrencies.html)\n\nWe identified a number of servers Lazarus used as a backend system for temporarily holding stolen\ndata. We were able to access this backend, which provided us with valuable information about this\nattack and its victims.\n\nAround 55% of the victims of RATANKBA’s Powershell version were located in India and\nneighboring countries. This implies that the Lazarus group could be is either collecting intelligence\nabout targets in this region, or is at an early stage of planning. They could have also been\nperforming exercises in preparation for an attack against similar targets.\n\nThe majority of the observed victims were not using enterprise versions of Microsoft\nsoftware. Less than 5% of the victims were Microsoft Windows Enterprise users, which means that\ncurrently, RATANKBA mostly affects smaller organizations or individual users, not larger\norganizations. It’s possible that Lazarus is using tools other than RATANKBA to target larger\norganizations.\n\nLazarus’ backend logs also record victim IP addresses. Based on a reverse WHOIS lookup, none of\nthe victims can be associated with a large bank or a financial institution. However, we did manage\nto identify victims that are likely employees of three web software development companies in India\nand one in South Korea.\n\n**_Infection Flow_**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: RATANKBA Infection Flow_\n\nRATANKBA is delivered to its victims using a variety of lure documents, including Microsoft\nOffice documents, malicious CHM files, and different script downloaders. These documents\ncontain topics discussing either software development or digital currencies. The growth of\ncryptocurrencies may be a driving force behind the use of cryptocurrency-related lures.\n\nAn example of a lure used in a RATANKBA attack can be seen below:\n\n_Figure 2: Malicious CHM file used as RATANKBA lure_\n\nOnce the lure’s recipient opens and executes the file, a backdoor will be dropped into the victim’s\nsystem. This RATANKBA backdoor is what is used to communicate with RATANKBA’s\nCommand-and-Control (C&C) server. We have observed two initial conversations with the C&C\nserver (all are done via HTTP GET or POST to the server):\n\nHTTP POST to {script}.jsp?action=BaseInfo&u=XXX: Sends the victim information to the\nbackend server\nHTTP GET to {script}.jsp?action=What&u=XXX: Checks if there are any pending jobs for the\nbackdoor\nThis means that the backdoor is responsible for both uploading victim information, as well as\nexecuting any tasks that the controller has assigned to it, which includes the following:\n\n_Killkill: Stops the backdoor’s activities_\n_interval: Changes the interval in which the backdoor retrieves jobs; the default interval is set at 120_\nseconds\n_cmd: Executes shell commands_\n_exe:Reflectively injects a DLL downloaded from a specific URL_\nIn addition to the backdoor’s modus operandi, the attackers will use a Microsoft WMI commandline tool to list the compromised system’s running processes, which are sent to the C&C server:\n\n_“C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe” /c “wmic process get processid,commandline,sessionid | findstr_\n_SysWOW”_\n_“C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe” /c “wmic process get processid,commandline,sessionid | findstr_\n_x86”_\n**_Technical Analysis_**\n\n\n-----\n\np j y\ncompromised endpoint. The controller gives the attackers the ability to manipulate the victims’ host\nby queueing tasks on the main server. RATANKBA retrieves and executes the tasks, and retrieves\nthe collected information.\n\n_Figure 3: RATANKBA communication diagram_\n\nThe RATANKBA malware has a control model that does not use real-time communication between\nthe backdoor and the attacker. Instead, both the remote controller and the backdoor connect to its\nmain communication control server to push or pull pieces of information. The controller uses a\ngraphical UI interface and can be used to push code to the server, while the backdoor regularly\nconnects to the server to check for pending tasks. The controller downloads the victim profiles from\nthe server. If the profiles are already downloaded by the controller, they are deleted from the server\nside. The controller can post victim-specific tasks as well as global specific tasks to the server.\nBelow are the various functionalities of RATANKBA’s controller:\n\n**Command Name** **Function**\n_get_time_ Retrieves the server time\n_delete_inf_ Deletes the downloaded victim profiles\n_delete_con_ Deletes the connection log files if they were\nalready downloaded\n_Kill:_ Posts a job to kill the backdoor\n_inject_ Posts a job for DLL injection\n_Interval_ Changes the sleep interval\n_Cmd_ Posts a job for command shell execution\n_delete_cmd_ Retrieves the job results and deletes the posted\njob\n_broadcast_cmd:_ Posts a job for all the backdoors connecting to\nthe server\n\n_Figure 4: RATANKBA main console interface_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: RATANKBA host manipulation console_\n\nRATANKBA’s controllers use the “Nimo Software HTTP Retriever 1.0” user-agent string for its\ncommunication. The communication protocol format for the controller and backdoor is as follows:\n\n_<domain>/<jsp filename>.jsp?action=<corresponding actions plus additional needed_\n_parameters>`_\nOne of most notable changes on the new RATANKBA variant is that the new version was written\nin Powershell, whereas the original variant was in PE form. The shift from PE to Powershell makes\nit more difficult for antivirus solutions to detect. The screenshot below shows the conversion from\nC/C++ code to Powershell, while the protocol remained unchanged.\n\n_Figure 6: C/C++ version of RATANKBA_\n\n_Figure 7: Powershell version of RATANKBA_\n\n**_Profile of the Attackers_**\n\nWhile we do not have any knowledge of who the actual Lazarus attackers are, the data collected\nfrom the backend systems gives us some insights into the internet usage patterns of systems likely\nowned by Lazarus group members. Clues regarding the profiles of the attackers was also found,\nincluding those connected to developers and at least one operator. All of them appear to be native\nKorean speakers, or at least have Korean language proficiency that is at the near-native level. We\nbelieve at least one of them also understands Chinese.\n\nWe also observed clues that the attackers are interested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC)\nand Ant Share (NEO). One of them transferred shares of NEO at a good market price.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Empty cryptocurrency wallet of the attacker_\n\n_Figure 9: An attacker transfers 594 NEO to another wallet, with the money going to a mixer_\n\n_Figure 10: An attacker mining Ant Share_\n\n**_Defending against RATANKBA_**\n\nGiven Lazarus’ use of a wide array of tools and techniques in their operations, it’s reasonable to\nassume that the group will continue to use ever-evolving tactics in their malicious activities.\nOverall, an organization will need multilayered security strategies, as Lazarus and other similar\ngroups are experienced cybercriminals who employ different strategies to get past organizational\ndefenses.\n\nThe impact of this malware can be mitigated with proven mitigation techniques such as routinely\nscanning the network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and\nspreading through an organization. In addition, educating employees and other key people in an\n[organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look out for when](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/keep-an-eye-out-for-these-social-engineering-scams)\nit comes to malicious attacks.\n\nOther mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s\n[perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help](http://blog.trendmicro.com/ensuring-comprehensive-endpoint-security/)\nprevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.\n\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Security™ and Vulnerability Protection provide virtual patching that protects](https://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/cloud-solutions/deep-security/index.html)\nendpoints from threats such as malicious redirections to malware-hosting URLs as well as those\n[that exploit unpatched vulnerabilities.
