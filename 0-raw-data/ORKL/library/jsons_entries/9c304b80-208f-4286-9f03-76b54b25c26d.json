The malware is named after one of its payloads, Blister, which further deploys second-stage\npayloads.\n\nThe threat actors orchestrating the Blister campaigns have been active since 15 September 2021, and have been using code-signing\ncertificates that were validated on 23 August 2021. These certificates were issued by Sectigo to Blist LLC’s mail.ru email address. It is notable\nthat mail.ru is a widely used Russian email service provider.\n\nThe malware masquerades malicious components as genuine executable files, due to which it has a low detection rate. Apart from using codesigning certificates, the threat actors are also leveraging other techniques, such as binding Blister to a legitimate library on the infected system,\nto stay under the radar.\n\n## Modus Operandi of the Blister Campaign\n\nThreat actors are known to use code-signing to circumvent basic static security checks to compromise the victim systems. The Blister malware\nis no different in that it uses a Sectigo issued certificate to make the loader malware program look genuine to security products. It then deploys\na Remote Access Trojan (RAT) on the target system to gain unauthorized access.\n\nA .dll file is used as a second stage payload to execute the encoded RAT/ CobaltStrike beacon. Since the .dll file has no malicious traces there\nhave been very few detections on VirusTotal. However, the loader uses Rundll32.exe to execute the LaunchColorCpl function exported by the\nmalicious .dll file.\n\n_Overview of the Blister malware campaign_\n\n## Leveraging Code-Signing Certificates to Avoid Detection\n\nThe below image contains the details of the certificate to an entity called “Blist LLC”. It is common for cybercriminals to either steal codesigning certificates from compromised targets, or to use a front company to obtain the certificate, to sign the malware with.\n\n_Certificate issued to Blist LLC_\n\nSectigo has since revoked the certificate issued to the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Certificate issued by Sectigo_\n\n## First Stage of Infection\n\n**Overview of the Loader**\n\nThe loader writes a malicious .dll file in a directory created inside the user Temp folder.\nIn one of the analysed samples, the malware created a folder named “goalgames” and inside it the loader dumped holorui.dll.\nThe .dll houses the code for deploying the RAT to gain unauthorized access to the infected system.\n\n_The loader writes a .dll file in the user_\n\n_Temp folder_\n\n**Step by Step Working of the Loader**\n\nThe Win32 API createDirectoryW is used to create a folder called “goalgames” in the path: C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\n_directory. as shown below._\n\n_Using Win32 API createDirectoryW to_\n\n_create a folder in the user Temp folder_\n\nBefore dumping the .dll, the loader sets the working directory to C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\goalgames via Win32 API\n_SetCurrentDirectoryW._\n\n_Using Win32 API_\n\n_SetCurrentDirectoryW to set the working directory_\n\nAfter setting the working directory, the malware resolves the filename for the .dll file to holorui.dll and stores it in the register RCX, to later\npass it to Win32 API CreateFileW.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The malware resolves the filename for the .dll_\n\n\n_file to holorui.dll_\n\nThe file C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\goalgames\\holorui.dll is created using the CreateFileW API.\n\nusing CreateFileW API\n\n\n_holorui.dll created_\n\n\nOnce the file is created, the malware starts writing the content to the file by iteratively transferring bytes from the .dll payload in the\nloader. The Win32 API WriteFile is used to write contents into holorui.dll.\n\n_Win32 API WriteFile used to write contents_\n\n_into holorui.dll_\n\nThe malicious .dll is embedded in the initialized data segment of the PE executable of the loader and the bytes are transferred into\n_C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\goalgames\\holorui.dll._\n\n_The MZ header of the embedded file_\n\nUpon closing the handle to the holorui.dll file, written on to the disk in the Temp directory, the malware finishes delivering the second\nstage payload. Then the file handles are closed by the malware.\n\n_File handles closed by the malware_\n\nThe successful delivery of the malicious .dll can be confirmed by analyzing the interaction of the malware on the system.\n\n_Successful delivery of the malicious .dll_\n\nBased on analysing multiple signed loader samples, we have enumerated following distinct directory and payload names used within\ndifferent samples from the same campaign:\n\n_C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\goalgames\\holorui.dll_\n_C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Framwork\\axsssig.dll_\n_C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\oarimgamings\\holorui.dll_\n_C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\guirtsframworks\\Pasade.dll_\n\nNote: The content inside the .dll is the same despite having different names\n\n## Second Stage of Infection\n\nAt the second stage of infection, the loader generates a command line to execute the function LaunchColorCpl exported from the .dll, via\n_Rundll32.exe on the infected system._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Command line to execute the function_\n\n_LaunchColorCpl_\n\nA new process is created with the above command line to spawn a Rundll32 process via CreateProcessW Win32 API.\n\nSpawning a\n\n_Rundll32 process via CreateProcessW Win32 API_\n\nThe newly spawned Rundll32.exe process is listed in the process listing on the infected machine.\n\n_Newly spawned Rundll32.exe_\n\n_process_ _Command line confirmation for the newly spawned_\n\n_process_\n\nThe final payload is executed by the Rundll32.exe process.\n\n_Network activities between the infected host and the_\n\n_attacker C2_\nIn the part 2 of this article we will cover the internal working of the .dll payload in detail.\n\n##
