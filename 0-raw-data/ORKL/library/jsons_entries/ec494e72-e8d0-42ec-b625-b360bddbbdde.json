Due to their\nwide use in the region, threat actors are now more commonly using webhards to distribute\nmalware.\n\nThe actor behind the new BitRAT campaign appears to be Korean based on some of the\nKorean characters in the code snippets and the manner of its distribution.\n\n**Post promoting the BitRAT dropping Windows activator** _(ASEC)_\nTo properly use Windows 10, you need to purchase and activate a license with Microsoft.\n[While there are ways to get Windows 10 for free, you still need a valid Windows 7 license to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/you-can-still-upgrade-to-windows-10-for-free-heres-how/)\nget the free upgrade.\n\n\n-----\n\nThose who do not want to deal with licensing issues or do not have a license to upgrade\ncommonly turn to pirating Windows 10 and using unofficial activators, many of which\ncontain malware.\n\nIn this campaign, the malicious file promoted as a Windows 10 activator is named\n'W10DigitalActiviation.exe' and features a simple GUI with a button to \"Activate Windows\n10.\"\n\n**The malware downloader posing as a Windows activator** _(ASEC)_\nHowever, instead of activating the Windows license on the host system, the \"activator\" will\ndownload malware from a hardcoded command and control server operated by the threat\nactors.\n\nThe fetched payload is BitRAT, installed in %TEMP% as ‘Software_Reporter_Tool.exe’ and\nadded to the Startup folder. The downloader also adds exclusions for Windows Defender to\nensure that BitRAT won’t encounter detection issues.\n\nOnce the malware installation process is completed, the downloader deletes itself from the\nsystem leaving behind only BitRAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The downloader fetching the BitRAT payload** _(ASEC)_\n\n## A versatile RAT\n\nBitRAT is promoted as a powerful, inexpensive, and versatile malware that can snatch a\nwide range of valuable information from the host, perform DDoS attacks, UAC bypass, etc.\n\nBitRAT supports generic keylogging, clipboard monitoring, webcam access, audio\nrecording, credential theft from web browsers, and XMRig coin mining functionality.\n\nAdditionally, it offers remote control for Windows systems, hidden virtual network computing\n(hVNC), and reverse proxy through SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 (UDP). On that front, ASEC’s\n[analysts have found strong code similarities with TinyNuke, and its derivative, AveMaria](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tinynuke-info-stealing-malware-is-again-attacking-french-users/)\n(Warzone).\n\nThe hidden desktop feature on these RATs is so valuable that some hacking groups, like\nthe Kimsuky, incorporated them in their arsenal just to use the hVNC tool.\n\n## Risk of piracy\n\nEven if the legal and ethical aspects are ignored, using pirated software is always a security\ngamble.\n\nThe more tools are used to activate illegally obtained copies of software or crack their\nintellectual property protection systems, the greater the chances of ending up with a nasty\nmalware infection.\n\nThose who can’t afford to purchase a Windows license should look at alternative options\ninstead, such as accepting the limitations of the free version, monitoring for special offers\nfrom trustworthy platforms, or using Linux.\n\nUltimately, users should not trust license activators and any unsigned executable authored\nand released by unknown vendors to run on your system.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Ukraine supporters in Germany targeted with PowerShell RAT malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-supporters-in-germany-targeted-with-powershell-rat-malware/)\n\n[New stealthy Nerbian RAT malware spotted in ongoing attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-nerbian-rat-malware-spotted-in-ongoing-attacks/)\n\n[Microsoft May 2022 Patch Tuesday fixes 3 zero-days, 75 flaws](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-may-2022-patch-tuesday-fixes-3-zero-days-75-flaws/)\n\n[New NetDooka malware spreads via poisoned search results](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-netdooka-malware-spreads-via-poisoned-search-results/)\n\n[BitRAT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/bitrat/)\n[Microsoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft/)\n[RAT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rat/)\n[Remote Access Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/remote-access-trojan/)\n[South Korea](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/south-korea/)\n[webhards](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/webhards/)\n[Windows 10](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/windows-10/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
