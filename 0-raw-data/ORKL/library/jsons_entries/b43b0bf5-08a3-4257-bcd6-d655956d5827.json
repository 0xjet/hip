This data provided CTU™ researchers with insight into emerging threats and\n\n developing trends that customers can use to guide risk management decision-making and\n\n prioritization.\n\n The motivation and context for IR engagements vary. For example, an organization's\n\n decision to use IR services could be influenced by the organization's internal resources,\n\n media reporting, or the organization entering a sensitive operational period. As a result,\n\n observed threat types may not reflect the broader threat landscape. Despite these\n\n limitations, data from IR engagements reveals how threat actors breach networks, how this\n\n activity impacts affected organizations, and how the incidents could have been prevented.\n\n\n-----\n\n### KEY POINTS:\n\n###### Early detection of malicious activity can stop malware infections from progressing to ransomware deployment.\n\n The vast majority of cyberattacks observed by Secureworks incident responders are likely financially motivated. Both ransomware and business email compromise (BEC) remain major threats.\n\n Phishing continues to represent the most significant initial attack vector (IAV).\n\n\n-----\n\n### OBSERVED TRENDS\n\n###### CTU researchers examined the threat actors, engagement types, and IAVs observed in Q1 2023 IR engagements.\n\n##### Engagement types\n\n###### Malware infections comprised almost one-third of IR engagements during the\n\n quarter (see Figure 1). Network compromise was the second-largest type of\n\n engagement at 15%. The engagement type classifications can reflect the point\n\n at which the incident is detected. Some of the incidents in these categories\n the overall threat landscape\n might have progressed to ransomware attacks if they had not been detected\n or reflect the prevalence of\n and stopped at an early stage by the victim’s extended detection and response\n the threat. For example, BEC\n (XDR) solution.\n\n\n###### Malware Infection\n32%\n\n###### Network Compromise\n15%\n\n\n###### Other\n15%\n\n###### Ransomware\n6%\n\n###### Business Email Compromise\n7%\n\n###### Compromised Account\n7%\n\n###### Web Phishing Compromise Activity 7%\n11%\n\n\nFIGURE 1. _IR engagement types in Q1 2023. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Initial access vectors\n\n###### Phishing was the most frequently observed IAV (see Figure 2), accounting for 34% of Secureworks\n\n engagements this quarter. The second most prevalent IAV was exploitation of vulnerabilities in\n\n internet-facing devices at 20%. The proportion of drive-by downloads (17%) was a significant increase\n\n over 2022, when it comprised only 2% of IR engagements across the entire year. This increase may\n\n reflect financially motivated threat actors’ growing interest in the use of SEO poisoning. During Q1\n\n 2023, drive-by downloads led to malware infections and network compromises.\n\n\n###### Other 2%\n\n Phishing 34%\n\n Vulnerabilities in Internet-Facing Devices 20%\n\n\n###### Brute Force 7%\n\n\n###### Insider 5%\n\n\n###### Stolen Credentials 15%\n\n Drive-By Download 17%\n\n\n###### Internet-Facing Devices 20%\n\nFIGURE 2. _IAVs observed in Q1 2023.

The threat actor then posed as a senior\n\nexecutive to send text messages to employees’ personal cell\n\nphones and request gift cards. The investigation highlighted\n\nissues that organizations should consider when implementing\n\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA).\n\nThe attacker initially authenticated to an employee’s Microsoft\n\n365 (M365) account using credentials they had previously\n\nobtained from an unknown source. The authentication\n\noriginated from a network address associated with a public\n\nvirtual private network (VPN) service. Although the account\n\nwas protected with MFA, the employee’s acceptance of the\n\nattacker-generated MFA request gave the threat actor access\n\nto the account.\n\nThe threat actor made several attempts to distribute a\n\nmalicious file to gain access to other employees’ accounts\n\nby uploading a file to the compromised user’s SharePoint,\n\nrenaming it, and sharing it. Microsoft Defender Advanced\n\nThreat Protection (ATP) flagged the file and classified it as a\n\nPhish_PDF_MacLer_A malware sample. This detection made\n\nthe link inaccessible to the recipients.\n\nAfter sharing the linked file, the attacker followed up with an\n\nemail asking if the recipients received the link and were able\n\nto access the shared file. On discovering that the link was\n\ninaccessible, the threat actor created a malicious inbox rule to\n\ndelete messages mentioning ‘Sharepoint’ or ‘file.’ They then\n\nuploaded a new file and successfully re-shared it.\n\nTwo employees opened the file. One employee’s account\n\nwas protected with MFA, but the other account was not.\n\nThe threat actor authenticated to the unprotected account\n\nand then posed as this employee to send texts requesting\n\ngift cards.\n\n\nOrganizations could mitigate BEC attacks by comprehensively\n\nimplementing MFA across all user accounts, including senior\n\nexecutives’ accounts, and training employees not to accept\n\nMFA requests they did not generate.\n\n##### Use of corporate devices to access personal resources led to malware\n\nSecureworks incident responders investigated several\n\nincidents during the quarter where an employee accessing\n\npersonal or non-work resources from a corporate device\n\nresulted in a malware infection or compromise. One\n\ncompromise began with an individual using a corporate laptop\n\nto read personal email and clicking a link that downloaded and\n\nexecuted a Qakbot malware variant. The email message was\n\nmanipulated to appear that it was part of an existing business\nthemed email thread, although it was sent to the recipient’s\n\npersonal email account and was not relevant to their\n\nemployment. Clicking a link in the email led to a download that\n\nculminated in obfuscated Qakbot code loading and running on\n\nthe victim’s system.\n\nQakbot then downloaded additional malware that allowed the\n\nthreat actor to execute network reconnaissance commands.\n\nApproximately 20 minutes later, the attacker used a privileged\n\nuser account to remotely execute Cobalt Strike on at least\n\nthree domain controllers. Then they leveraged the impacted\n\nsystems to deploy Cobalt Strike throughout the environment,\n\nultimately compromising numerous systems across multiple\n\ncountries. In addition, Cobalt Strike enabled the threat actor\n\nto obtain user account information and password hashes\n\nfor all accounts within the domain, putting all user account\n\npasswords at risk. The attack took just over one day from the\n\ninitial download.\n\nIn another incident, two malicious files detected on a\n\ncompromised host (‘123.txt’ and ‘123.bat’) contained the same\n\n[contents: ‘%0 |%0.’ Known as a fork bomb, this technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb)\n\n\n-----\n\ncontinuously spawns processes and repeatedly executes the\n\nfile. Fork bombs consume system resources and slow down\n\nthe system, sometimes leading to a system crash. Analysis\n\nsuggests that the fork bomb was created when the victim\n\nvisited a puzzle site and downloaded what they believed to be\n\npuzzle code.\n\nIn a third incident, a user downloaded and opened a ZIP\n\narchive file containing adult content on a corporate device.\n\nAlthough the user deleted the files, an additional malicious\n\n[file containing Raspberry Robin malware had been created](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/raspberry-robin-worm-highly-complex-upgrade)\n\nseconds after opening the downloaded content. This malware\n\nexecuted twice, generating traffic from the host to the Tor\n\nanonymity network.\n\nWhile it may not be practical or desirable to prevent\n\nemployees from accessing non-work resources on corporate\n\ndevices, monitoring downloads and using application\n\nallowlisting solutions could have prevented these incidents\n\nfrom creating malicious files on the system.\n\n##### Malicious OneNote file led to Black Basta ransomware incident\n\nOne Secureworks IR engagement revealed that a threat\n\nactor inserted a malicious email into an existing legitimate\n\nemail thread to deliver Qakbot. The sender posed as a third\n\nparty known to the recipient, although there was no attempt\n\nto disguise the actual sender’s email address and it visibly\n\nbelonged to a different individual and domain. The email\n\ncontained a malicious OneNote file attachment. When the\n\n\nscripts and PowerShell downloaded and executed a Qakbot\n\npayload. This infection chain allowed the attacker to remotely\n\naccess the compromised system.\n\nThe presence of Qakbot triggered Microsoft Defender alerts,\n\nwhich caused the payload file to be quarantined. Nonetheless,\n\nthe threat actor was able to continue the compromise,\n\ndownloading tools for reconnaissance, privilege escalation,\n\n[and lateral movement. The AdFind.exe command-line query](https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/)\n\ntool queried Active Directory, and Base64-encoded PowerShell\n\nlaunched a reconnaissance-related function to discover\n\naccounts with local administrator access.\n\nThe attacker logged on to one of the two servers in the\n\nenvironment via an Administrator account and installed the\n\n[ScreenConnect remote desktop tool. This tool provided an](https://control.connectwise.com/support/trial)\n\nadditional foothold and allowed persistent and direct access\n\nto the compromised host after rebooting. After 15 hours of\n\ninactivity, the threat actor then installed additional tools and\n\nservices on the originally compromised host and the server.\n\nThese tools included the PSEXESVC service, which is created\n\n[when the PsExec remote access tool executes a command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)\n\non the system. Finally, the attacker connected to the second\n\nserver. Both servers were encrypted with the Black Basta\n\n[ransomware operated by the GOLD REBELLION threat group,](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-rebellion)\n\nand the ransom note was created. This incident continues a\n\n[trend Secureworks incident responders observed in late 2022 of](https://www.secureworks.com/resources/rp-irs-learning-from-incident-response-team-2022-year-in-review)\n\nmultiple engagements involving Qakbot leading to Black Basta\n\ndeployment.\n\n\nrecipient downloaded and executed the attachment, batch\n\n\n-----\n\n### RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nAt the end of engagements, Secureworks incident responders provide customers with proactive recommendations to\n\nreduce the chance of similar incidents in the future, as well as remediation advice to prevent further damage from the\n\ncurrent incident. General proactive recommendations reflect good security practices relevant to most organizations:\n\n###### • Enforce MFA for access to corporate systems and services. Comprehensive enforcement of\n\n MFA across all accounts and platforms helps prevent threat actors from successfully using\n\n stolen credentials. Implementing phishing-resistant MFA that incorporates number matching,\n\n geolocation validation, or PKI adds extra protection.\n\n • Develop and implement security awareness training. A relevant and accessible training program\n\n helps users understand the role they play in limiting the impact of cybersecurity breaches.\n\n • Conduct regular internal and external penetration tests and vulnerability scans. Penetration\n\n testing lets organizations understand possible attack vectors and security weaknesses from the\n\n perspective of a potential attacker.\n\n • Regularly patch and update systems and applications.\n\n • Implement full endpoint, cloud, and network traffic monitoring.\n\nSecureworks incident responders also issue specific proactive advice relevant to each engagement. The case studies in\n\nthis report prompted the following recommendations:\n\n###### • Implement an allowlisting policy and solution for software and website access to limit exposure to\n unwanted and malicious programs and content. Perform comprehensive testing before deploying\n\n any solution.\n\n • Conduct phishing simulation exercises to help users avoid falling victim to malicious emails.\n\n • Implement web filters to restrict users from accessing personal email accounts or other non work content.\n\n • Ensure that local administrators have separate credentials for their standard and administrative\n activities to make it difficult for threat actors to elevate privileges.\n\nThe following were the most common remediation recommendations Secureworks incident responders gave in Q1 2023:\n\n###### • Reset any potentially compromised or exposed passwords and credentials. This action prevents\n\n the attacker from reusing the credentials to regain entry or from sharing them with other\n\n threat actors.\n\n • Rebuild or restore affected systems and hosts from known-good media.\n\n • Reset the KRBTGT (Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket) service account if the attacker could have\n\n accessed it.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CONCLUSION \n\n###### CTU researchers track threats and behaviors identified during IR engagements to develop\n\n an understanding of the nature and evolution of various threats. Through countermeasure\n\n development, periodic trend analysis, and ad-hoc tactical reporting on activity observed during\n\n IR engagements, CTU researchers and Secureworks incident responders continuously provide\n\n protection, insight, and guidance derived from real-world incidents to Secureworks customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### About Secureworks Incident Response\n\n###### The Secureworks incident response team provides a wide range of expertise, cyber threat intelligence, and\n\n purpose-built technologies to help organizations prepare for and respond to cyber incidents successfully.\n\n Secureworks can assist organizations with onsite (subject to applicable pandemic travel restrictions) or\n\n remote Incident Commanders in support of an incident response.
