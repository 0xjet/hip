But in recent years, a mysterious\nhacker crew called WindShift has targeted specific individuals working in government\ndepartments and critical infrastructure across the Middle East. And they’re exploiting\nweaknesses believed to affect all Apple Mac models.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat s according to United Arab Emirates-based researcher Taha Karim, who said the targets\nwere located in the so-called Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. That encompasses\nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. The targets were sent spear\nphishing emails containing a link to a site run by the hackers. Once the target clicked on the\nlink, an attack would launch, the eventual aim of which was to download malware dubbed\nWindTale and WindTape.\n\nKarim, a researcher at cybersecurity company DarkMatter, said the attackers had found a\nway to “bypass all native macOS security measures.” Once they’d penetrated those\ndefenses, the malware would exfiltrate documents of interest and continuously take\nscreenshots of the victims’ desktops. The attacks have been ongoing from 2016, through to\ntoday, the researcher added.\n\nKarim declined to say what kinds of critical infrastructure had been targeted and would name\nneither specific countries nor victims. He’s presenting his full findings on Thursday at the\n[Hack In The Box conference in Singapore.](https://gsec.hitb.org/sg2018/sessions/commsec-the-trails-of-windshift-apt/)\n\n**The Mac hack explained**\n\nDarkMatter said the hackers’ web page would attempt to install a .zip file containing the\nmalware. Once the download was completed, the malware would attempt to launch via\nwhat’s known as a “custom URL-scheme.” That’s not as complex as it sounds. Developers\ncan create their own URL scheme so that specific parts of their app will open when a link is\nopened. For instance, imagine a link that opens a Maps application that takes the user to a\nspecific place and instantly provides directions from their location. That requires a custom\nURL scheme to be registered on the computer or smartphone first to work as it does.\n\nHere’s what happens in the case of the WindShift team’s malware: First, a user visits a\nwebsite that tries to install a .zip file. Inside is the malware. The Apple Safari browser will\nautomatically unzip the file and macOS will automatically register the malware’s chosen URL\nscheme. The same website from which the malware was downloaded will then make a\nrequest, via the now-registered custom URL scheme, to launch the malicious software. The\nattackers are relying on victims to keep the site live once they’ve installed the .zip file, long\nenough for the malware to work. The malware is then run by the operating system to handle\nthe custom URL scheme’s request. From there, WindTale and WindTape can silently start\npilfering documents and taking screenshots.\n\nLooking across major desktop operating systems, the problem may be unique to Apple. This\nsame method wouldn’t have worked on Windows, according to Karim, who said Microsoft\nhad added extra protections to prevent such attacks.\n\nThere are some barriers the WindShift hackers had to overcome to successfully infect their\ntargets. The latest versions of Safari will show a prompt asking the user to confirm they want\nto run those custom URL schemes. And if the user clicks allow, there will be another request\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom Apple s Gatekeeper security feature, which will again ask the user if they really want to\ninstall the files.\n\nThose might seem like decent preventative measures, but as Karim said, the attacker can\ncontrol much of what’s inside the Safari alert to make their malware appear innocuous.\nWardle, who tested the attack method for Forbes, played around with prompts, so that one\nasked: “Do you want to allow this page to open Google?” Another replaced “Google” with a\nsmiley face emoji. Karim suggested Mail.app might dupe the average user.\n\nMac hacker Patrick Wardle replicates an attack that tries to trick users into downloading\nmalware. ... [+] In this demo, the malware's name has been turned into a smiley face.\n\nPatrick Wardle\nThere’s another potentially troublesome aspect to the WindShift hacks. If the attackers or\ntheir victims copied the malware so it was shared across a network, all users could have the\nmalicious custom URL scheme automatically added to their Apple Macs. “Attackers could\nuse this simple technique to move laterally inside the network resulting in the infection of a\nlarger number of Mac computers,” Karim added.\n\nKarim said he’d contacted Apple. The company told him the issue was closed from its\nperspective. “But it’s unclear whether any specific remediation action was taken,” he added.\n\nAt the time of publication, Apple hadn’t responded to a request for comment.\n\n[Follow me on Twitter.
