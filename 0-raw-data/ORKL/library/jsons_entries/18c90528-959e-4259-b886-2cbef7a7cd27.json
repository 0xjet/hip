Remote administration tools (RATs) can be used to connect to a](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/rat-remote-access-tools/?utm_source=kdaily&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation&_ga=2.76390038.267654168.1540215705-938421168.1494508493)\nremote device on the network and not only view the screen contents, but also take full\ncontrol, issuing commands from remote input devices (keyboard/mouse on a computer;\ntouch screen on a smartphone).\n\nRATs were initially created with good intentions — to help manage various settings and apps,\nwell, remotely. After all, it is far easier for tech support staff to select the right check boxes\nand settings themselves rather than trying to explain to the user what to do over the phone\n— and even easier for the user.\n\nBut in cybercriminals’ hands, RATs are transformed into a formidable weapon: Installing a\n[Trojan on your smartphone that provides someone with remote access to the gadget is like](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/trojan/?utm_source=kdaily&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\ngiving the keys to your apartment to a stranger. The malicious use of RATs is so common\nthat the acronym increasingly stands for “remote access Trojan.”\n\nHaving connected to your device through a RAT, hackers can do as they please, including\nsnooping on all your passwords and PINs, logging into banking apps and transferring your\nmoney, and subscribing you to unwanted services that quietly eat up funds on your mobile\naccount or credit card — as well as stealing your mail, social network, and IM accounts to\nextract money from friends in your name. And that’s after copying all your photos to\nblackmail you later if any of them happen to be of a private nature.\n\nTypically, RATs are used for spying. Such malware allows jealous husbands or wives to spy\non their spouses, but more seriously, it can also be used for stealing corporate secrets. For\nexample, [AndroRAT (detected in spring this year) sneakily takes pictures with the](https://www.zdnet.com/article/androrat-new-android-malware-strain-can-hijack-older-phones/)\nsmartphone camera and records sound (including telephone conversations). It also steals\nWi-Fi passwords based on geolocation. This means that no negotiations are ever\nconfidential, and it makes penetrating the office network a piece of cake.\n\n### Rooting Trojans\n\n“Root access” in some operating systems, including Android, is another name for superuser\nrights, which allow changes to system folders and files. For regular user tasks, such access\nis completely unnecessary and disabled by default. But some advanced enthusiasts like to\nhave it to customize the operating system. See our post Rooting your Android: Advantages,\ndisadvantages, and snags to learn why you should think twice before doing so.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome malicious programs, called rooting Trojans, can get root privileges using vulnerabilities\nin the operating system. Having superuser rights allows cybercriminals to configure your\nsmartphone for their purposes. For example, they can force the device to open full-screen\nads. Or install malware or adware in the background, without any notifications.\n\nA favorite rooting malware trick is to secretly delete apps installed on the smartphone and\nreplace them with either phishing or malware-augmented software. Moreover, superuser\nrights can be used to prevent you from removing malware from your device. No wonder that\nrooting Trojans are considered today’s most dangerous type of mobile threat.\n\n### Modular Trojans\n\nJack-of-all-trades modular Trojans can perform several different malicious actions, either\nsimultaneously or selectively according to the situation. One of the most striking examples of\nsuch a Trojan is [Loapi, detected in late 2017. As soon as it penetrates a victim’s device, it](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/loapi-trojan/20510/)\nimmediately ensures its own safety by requesting administrator rights — and it won’t take no\nfor an answer; if it is refused, the dialog window pops up again and again, preventing the\nsmartphone from being used. And if access is granted, it becomes impossible to remove\nLoapi from the device.\n\nThe Trojan then launches any one of five modules. It can display ads, subscribe the user to\n[paid content by following links, carry out DDoS attacks on command from a remote server,](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/ddos-distributed-denial-of-service-attack/?utm_source=kdaily&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nand forward SMS messages to cybercriminals, concealing them so that the user does not\nnotice malicious transactions.\n\nAnd in its spare time, when not engaged with these important tasks, the Trojan stealthily\nmines cryptocurrency, most often when the smartphone is connected to a power outlet or\nexternal battery. Mining is a complex computational process that gobbles up energy and\nresources, so the battery takes a very long time to charge. This can have fatal consequences\n[for phones: Our experts discovered firsthand that a couple of days of Loapi activity is enough](https://securelist.com/jack-of-all-trades/83470/)\nto ruin a smartphone battery through overheating.\n\n### How to defend against the worst Android malware\n\nAs you can see, the dangers posed by RATs, rooting Trojans, and modular malware are\nserious. But you can guard against them. Here are some simple rules:\n\nFirst of all, [block app installs from unknown sources. This option is disabled in Android](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/android-8-permissions-guide/23981/#install-unknown-apps)\nby default, and it should stay that way. It is no panacea, but it does solve most\nproblems associated with mobile Trojans.\nDo not try to skimp by downloading hacked versions of apps. Many of them are\ninfected.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Do not click on links promising the moon. WhatsApp offers of free airline tickets are](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/new-airline-tickets-scam/22179/)\nusually just an attempt to steal your personal data, and they download malware to your\n[smartphone as a bonus. The same applies to phishing, including texts from friends or](https://securelist.com/the-rise-of-mobile-banker-asacub/87591/)\nstrangers containing “Is this your photo?”-type messages.\nDo not ignore updates for Android and apps installed on your device. Updates patch\nholes through which attackers can sneak into your smartphone.\nCheck what rights apps are asking for, and do not be afraid to refuse access to\npersonal information and potentially dangerous functions in Android — in most cases,\nnothing terrible will happen if such requests are denied.\nPut a good antivirus on your smartphone. For example, Kaspersky Internet Security for\nAndroid not only finds and removes Trojans, but also blocks websites with malware and\nmobile subscriptions.\n\n[android](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/android/)\n[AndroRAT](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/androrat/)\n[Loapi](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/loapi/)\n[mobile apps](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/mobile-apps/)\n[modular Trojans](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/modular-trojans/)\n[RAT](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/rat/)\n[root](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/root/)\n[rooting](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/rooting/)\n[smartphones](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/smartphones/)\n[threats](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/threats/)\n[trojans](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/trojans/)\n\nShare article\n\nRelated\n\n\n-----",
