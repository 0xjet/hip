The Shellcode for\ncommunication is conducted depending on Beacon mode which is generated on the basis of automatic attack\ndetection platform-Cobalt Strike. This kind of attack pattern disguising as non-malicious real file in the host of its\ntarget, it sending a network heartbeat package every 60 seconds, and it also send data information via the Cookie\nfield, all these features of this attack pattern are designed to evade the detection of security software and the\ninterception of firewall on the targeted host. Considering the relationship between this attack and Cobalt Strike\nplatform, we name it as APT-TOCS (TOCS refers to Threat on Cobalt Strike.) for now.\n\nThe core step of APT-TOCS is downloading the script functionalities of Shellcode, which downloads a field of data\ninto memory for operation by calling powershell.exe.The decrypted data is a field of executable Shellcode that is\ngenerated by Cobalt Strike (An automatic attack testing platform). After loading the script of Shellcode, the\nAnalysis Group of ANTIY did a series of correlation analysis, then we found a PE program that maybe act as a\nguiding executable file in similar attacks. The loaded Shellcode script can be used to call command line to add a\ncertain field of encrypted date into memory and run it. The decrypted date turns out to be executable Shellcode\nwhich is generated by Cobalt Strike. The related script can be loaded via the guiding PE program or vulnerability.\nThis kind of attack pattern has several features which including running in memory, no hard disk writing operations,\ncommunicating via Beacon, multi-beacon communication is acceptable, and several Beacons can work\nsimultaneously. Such attack can be launched without the support of vector file, in fact it depends on network\nprojection and laterally move in the internal network as required conducting an attack. So, it will bring great\ndifficulties to the forensic work. It is important to note that, all the Sandboxes we know are disabling to fight\nagainst this kind of attack.\n\nIt seems that the attack capability of APT-TOCS is close to that of APT-level. However, it relied on automatic\nattack testing platform instead of abilities of the attack team.\n\n## 2 Analysis on incident sample \n\n### 2.1 Leading files and sample downloading\n\nAPT-TOCS used “powershell.exe” to execute Shellcode scripts to realize remote control on targeted system. The\nanalysts of Antiy thought that the attacker might know several remote injection methods of script downloading\nprivilege, such as directly making the scrip be executed on the host by using security vulnerabilities. Meanwhile,\nwe found the following binary leading attack files (hereinafter referred to as Sample A) were used in similar attacks\nbefore:\n\n**Virus name** Trojan/Win32.MSShell\n\n**Original file name** ab.exe\n\n**MD5** 44BCF2DD262F12222ADEAB6F59B2975B\n\n**Processor structure** X86\n\n**File size** 72.0 KB (73,802 bytes)\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 1**\n\n|Virus name|Trojan/Win32.MSShell|\n|---|---|\n|Original file name|ab.exe|\n|MD5|44BCF2DD262F12222ADEAB6F59B2975B|\n|Processor structure|X86|\n|File size|72.0 KB (73,802 bytes)|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\n**File format** BinExecute/Microsoft.EXE[:X86]\n\n**Time Stamp** 2009-05-10 07:02:12\n\n**Digital signature** NO\n\n**Shell type** Unknown\n\n**Compilation language** Microsoft Visual C++\n\nThe functionality code of the scripts embedded in this PE sample is completely the same with the one of Shellcode\nscript Antiy has acquired, while the encryption data of them differs from each other. This PE sample was firstly\nuploaded to Virustotal on May 2, 2015:\n\n**Figure 1 Downloading encryption data using powershell.exe embedded in PE files**\n\nThe PE sample used WinExec to operate embedded malware:\n\n**Figure 2 Using function WinExec to call powershell.exe to download leading data**\n\nTherefore, we can see that the “leading file” can be regarded as the leading part of attack. However, the execution\nand control still can be made depending on system and application vulnerabilities without this leading file.\n\nAccording to above information, we cannot make sure this leading sample has relationship with this APT incident.\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 2**\n\n|File format|BinExecute/Microsoft.EXE[:X86]|\n|---|---|\n|Time Stamp|2009-05-10 07:02:12|\n|Digital signature|NO|\n|Shell type|Unknown|\n|Compilation language|Microsoft Visual C++|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\n### 2.2 Key mechanism\n\nThe core part of APT-TOCS relies on the encrypted data scripts (hereinafter referred to as Sample B) downloaded\nby PowerShell. Figure 1 consists of various derivation relationships and major module functionalities:\n\n**Figure 3 Various derivation relationships and major module functionalities**\n\n### 2.3 Analysis on the major sample (Sample B) of APT-TOCS\n\nThe content (Here omitted the content of base64.) of Sample B is as follows:\n\n**Figure 4 Content of Sample B**\n\nThe functionality of this part of script is: decrypting the encrypted content of base64, decompressing with Gzip,\nresulting in module 1 and using PowerShell to download and execute.\n\n### 2.4 Analysis on script 1\n\nThe content of script 1 is as follows:\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 3**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\n**Figure 5 Content of script 1**\n\nThe functionality of this part is: decrypting data with base64 encryption and getting module 1, then writing to\nprocess powershell.exe, and executing and operating.\n\n### 2.5 Analysis on module 1\n\nThe functionality of this module is as follows: calling the function of wininet module, connecting the network,\ndownloading operations of module 2; and executing by downloading to the memory.\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 4**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\n**Figure 6 Request of HTTP GET**\n\n[Figure 6 shows that using request of HTTP GET to get file: http://146.0.43.107/hfYn.](http://146.0.43.107/hfYn)\n\n### 2.6 Analysis on module 2\n\nModule 2 established and listed system process rundll32.exe:\n\n**Figure 7 Establishing and listing process rundll32.exe**\n\nData that has been written into module 3:\n\n**Figure 8 Data that has been written into module 3**\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 5**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\nThough the data of module 3 started with “MZ”, it does not belong to PE files. Instead, it is the Shellcode with\nbackdoor functionality.\n\n**Figure 9 Shellcode that started with MZ（4D 5A）**\n\n### 2.7 Analysis on module 3\n\nThe module might connect the following 2 addresses with port 80:\n\n 146.0.***.*** (Romania)\n\n dc.******69.info (146.0.***.***) (Romania)\n\nSending request data and receiving return data.\n\n**Figure 10 Sending request data**\n\nThe decryption to above IP, domains and accessing addresses is “XOR 0x69”.\n\nJudging from the module strings and the system functions, the module belongs to backdoor program that can send\nGET request to designated addresses and heartbeat packages by using Cookie fields with 60 seconds’ interval. The\nheartbeat package data includes: check code, process ID, system version, IP address, computer name, account,\nwhether it is 64 bit process. Then it transmits by making use of both RSA and BASE64 encryption.\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 6**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\n**Figure 11 The original data of heartbeat package**\n\nAs the process ID and check code are different, the transmitted heartbeat package data are different each time. The\ncheck code is calculated through using process ID and the millisecond process during system startup. The algorithm\nis as follows:\n\n**Figure 12 Algorithm of check code**\n\nThe encrypted heartbeat package used Cookie field to transmit:\n\n**Figure 13 Content of the data package**\n\n## 3 The authentication analysis on the technology sources of this attack\n\nThe leading PE files, Sample_A and Sample B, associated by analysts of Antiy CERT used the exactly same\nmethod of PowerShell. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that Sample_A has no positive connection\nwith this attack due to the high standardization of relevant scripts. We still consider it as a series of attack incidents\nbased on other comprehensive analysis. The attacker might exploit the following ways to control the target host,\nsuch as social engineering e-mails, file bundling, exploiting system and application vulneratbilities, lateral\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 7**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\nmovement of intranet and so on.\n\nWe found “Beacon” strings when analyzing “Module 1”. According to existed experience, we doubted that\nShellcode is closely related with automatic attack testing platform Cobalt Strike. Therefore, our analysts carried out\ncomparison analysis on Beacon generated by Cobalt Strike, and authenticated the relationships between them.\n\nCobalt Strike is the GUI framework penetration tool based on metasploit. The business version of it integrates the\nfollowing characteristics: service scan, automatic overflow, multi-mode port espionage, various Trojan generation,\nphishing attack, site clone, target information obtaining, automatic browser attack and so on.\n\n### 3.1 Comparison of Module 1\n\nWe compared module 1 and the payload generated by using Beacon, and found only the following different data:\nthe Head data, request file name and IP address.\n\n**Figure 14 Comparison of Module 1**\n\nThe left is sample module 1, while the right is the module generated by Beacon. We can lead to the conclusion from\nthe comparison: module 1 is generated by Beacon.\n\nThe screenshot of data package in request is as follows:\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 8**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\n**Figure 15 The data package comparison of module 1**\n\n### 3.2 Comparison of disassembling commands of module 2\n\nOur analysts compared sample module 2 and relevant files of Beacon, and found that the disassembling commands\nbetween them are exactly the same with exception of functionality code, including XOR encryption at the entry,\ndownloading system DLL, obtaining function address, function calling modes and so on. The following lists three\npoints.\n\n**Sample module 2** **Relevant Beacon files**\n\n**XOR decry**\n**ption at t**\n**he entry**\n**(Using x86**\n**/shikata_g**\n**a_nai)**\n\n**© Antiy Labs All rights reserved** **Page 9**\n\n|Sample module 2 Relevant Beacon files|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|XOR decry ption at t he entry (Using x86 /shikata_g a_nai)|||\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis on APT-to-be Attack That Focusing on China s Government Agency**\n\n**The**\n**decrypted**\n**code** **at**\n**the entry**\n\n**Function**\n**calls**\n\n### 3.3 Comparison analysis on module 3 data package\n\nThe following figure is the GET request comparison of the module generated by sample module 3 and Beacon.\nHere we can see both of them use Cookie to transmit information that has been encrypted, and send requests\nactively every 60 seconds.

According to the traces in the past, we believe that the threat has been active for 5 years;\nunfortunately, there isn’t any powerful detection production and methods to defeat the malicious attack till now.\n\nThe reason why the CERT Analysis Team of ANTIY classified APT-TOCS into APT incidents is that it’s a kind of\ntargeted attack (one of the features of APT attack), it has anti-detection functions and also it can conceal itself.\nCompared with APT incidents in the past, the APT attack in this case doesn’t cost too much, and the attackers\naren’t responsible for coding. With the application of commercial attack platform, the attackers saved the cost of\nan attack, also the vulnerability built joint function provided by relevant attack platform make the attackers easy to\ndo injection. As a result, nations and organizations which without its own elite hacker groups and abundant capital\ncan also launch some kind of APT attack via the attack pattern mentioned in this case. Meanwhile, it’s more\ndifficult for us to tracing when facing such modeled attack.\n\nOne of the leaders in Information Security area-Bruce Schiner said, “when big events on information security\nhappened, people tend to treat it as an example of cyber warfare. It’s ridiculous. From my point of view, what’s\nhappening and going to happen is: more and more tactics in physical warfare are applied to cyber warfare. It’s\nimportant to note that, attack capabilities can be widely distributed if attackers take full advantages of certain\ntechnology, especially computer technology can make attack more powerful and automated.” Obviously, highly\nautomated commercial platform realized a high speed of spread of this attack capability (exceeded our\nanticipation).\n\nWe have to remind all relevant parties that we are confronting with the risk of large scale diffusion of network\narmaments which is led by the low cost of the attack capability. The commercial penetration attack detecting\nplatform has two sides, on one hand, it can check the network environment of systems effectively, on the other hand,\nfor nations, organizations and industries which has limited budget, it costs too much. Given the situation, all related\nparties should conduct more communication with each other, additionally, there is no doubt that both offensive\nparty and defensive party are supported by superpowers, these superpowers should prevent the attack technique\nfrom widely distributing.\n\nThe incident mentioned there has no difference with other cases we detected in the past, it shows that, on the way to\nrealize national informatizaion, we must fight against serious security challenges as we confronting now; it’s also a\ngood opportunity for our Chinese people and enterprises to demonstrate our faith and the efforts we made to\nconquer the challenge.\n\n## Appendix 1 References of Cobalt Strike and the author\n\nCobalt Strike is the business version of Armitage which is the penetration testing software of Metasploit figure\ninterface written by Java.
