During our research we\nobserved multiple variants impacting Windows and Linux systems. Unlike other ransomware groups, this ransomware family\ndoesn’t have an active leak site; instead it prefers to direct the impacted victim to negotiations through TOX chat and onionbased messenger instances.\n\nUnit 42 performed an in-depth analysis of the ransomware samples, the obfuscation and execution from this ransomware family,\nwhich contains very similar core functionality to the leaked Babuk/Babyk source code. It was also observed that one of the\nsamples deployed MicroBackdoor, an open-source backdoor allowing an attacker to browse the file system, upload and\ndownload files, execute commands, and remove itself from the system. We believe this was likely done to monitor the progress\nof the ransomware and maintain an additional foothold in compromised systems.\n\nDuring the analysis of the MicroBackdoor sample, Unit 42 observed the configuration and found an embedded IP address,\nbelonging to a threat actor we believe is potentially the developer: x4k, also known as L4ckyguy, unKn0wn, unk0w, _unkn0wn\nand x4kme.\n\nUnit 42 has observed x4k in various hacking and non-hacking forums, which has linked the threat actor to additional malicious\nactivity such as:\n\nCobalt Strike Beacon deployment.\nSelling proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits.\nCrypter services.\nDeveloping custom Kali Linux distros\n\n\n-----\n\nHosting and distributing malware.\nDeployment of malicious infrastructure.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks detects and prevents HelloXD and adjacent x4k activity with the following products and services: Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n[and Next-Generation Firewalls (including cloud-delivered security subscriptions such as WildFire).](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\n\nDue to the surge of this malicious activity, we’ve created this threat assessment for overall awareness.\n\nRelated Unit 42 Topics [Ransomware,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/ransomware/) [Ransomware Threat Report](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/ransomware-threat-report/)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nHelloXD Malware Overview\n\nPacker Analyses\n\nRansomware Internals\n\nWTFBBQ Pivots\n\nHunting for Ransomware Attribution\n\nConclusion\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n## HelloXD Malware Overview\n\nHelloXD is a ransomware family first observed in the wild on Nov. 30, 2021. This ransomware family uses a modified ClamAV\nlogo in their executables. ClamAV is an open-source antivirus engine used to detect malware. We also have observed additional\nsamples with different versions of the logo, which led us to believe the ransomware developer may like using the ClamAV\nbranding for their ransomware. Additionally, some of the observed samples include properties information that can be observed\nin Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Ransomware sample properties details.\n\nThe file description included the entry VlahmAV, a play on words on ClamAV, and the developer named the ransomware HelloXD\nand used another potential alias, uKnow, as the developer of HelloXD in the copyright section.\n\nWhen executed, HelloXD tries to disable shadow copies to inhibit system recovery before encrypting files using the following\ncommands embedded in the sample:\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally the ransomware does a ping to 1.1.1[.]1 and asks to wait a timeout of 3000 milliseconds between each reply, quickly\nfollowed with a delete command to delete the initial payload.\n\ncmd.exe /C ping 1.1.1[.]1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & Del /f /q\n\"C:\\Users\\admin\\Desktop\\xd.exe\"\n\nTwo of the initial set of samples identified create a unique mutex containing the following message:\n\nmutex: With best wishes And good intentions...\n\nAfter those commands are executed, the ransomware finishes by appending the file extension .hello, alongside a ransom note\ntitled Hello.txt (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Encrypted files and ransom\n\nnote.\nThe ransom note was modified between the observed samples. In the first sample we encountered (Figure 3, left), the ransom\nnote only linked to a TOX ID, whereas a later observed sample (Figure 3, right) links to an onion domain as well as a TOX ID\n(different from the one in the first version). At the time of writing, this site is down.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Ransomware note comparison between\n\nthe two observed variants.\n\nThe ransomware creates an ID for the victim which has to be sent to the threat actor to make it possible to identify the victim and\n[provide a decryptor. The ransom note also instructs victims to download Tox and provides a Tox Chat ID to reach the threat actor.](https://tox.chat/)\nTox is a peer-to-peer instant messaging protocol that offers end-to-end encryption and has been observed being used by other\n[ransomware groups for negotiations. For example, LockBit 2.0 leverages Tox Chat for threat actor communications.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lockbit-2-ransomware/)\n\nWhen observing both variants executing on virtual environments, we noted that the more recent variants changed the\nbackground to a ghost – a theme we’ve noticed in this threat actor’s work since our earliest observations of it. However, the\nprevious version didn’t change the background at all – it simply left the ransom note we observed previously (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4. Desktop wallpaper change –\n\nnone for older variant (left), ghost for newer variants (right).\n\n## Packer Analyses\n\nDuring analysis and threat intel gathering, we discovered two main packers used for HelloXD ransomware binaries, as well as for\nother malware samples linked to the potential author (Figure 5).\n\nThe first type of packer is a modified version of UPX. The code is extremely similar between UPX-packed binaries and the\ncustom packer, however the custom packer avoids using identifiable section names such as .UPX0 and .UPX1, and leaves the\ndefault text data and rsrc names unchanged There are also no magic bytes within the packed payload unlike UPX-packed\n\n\n-----\n\nbinaries, which contain the magic bytes UPX!.\n\nHowever, a dead giveaway that the sample is packed is the raw size of the .text section, which is zeroed out, while the virtual\nsize is much larger, as expected; this is identical to a .UPX0 section. As there is no data within the .text section on disk, the entry\npoint of the unpacking stub is within the .data section, which will unpack the malicious code into the .text section on runtime.\n\nAll of these details point toward the threat actor having modified or copied certain elements from the UPX packer, which can be\nfurther confirmed by comparing a UPX-packed binary with a custom-packed HelloXD binary.\n\nFigure 5. Similarities between custom packed sample (left) and sample packed with original UPX (right).\nThe second packer we discovered consists of two layers, with the second being the custom UPX packer discussed above. This\nparticular packer seems to be more common on x64 binaries and involves decrypting embedded blobs using a seemingly custom\nalgorithm containing unconventional instructions such as XLAT (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6. Decryption with XLAT and ROR8 instructions inside packer.\nAside from storing the encrypted second layer, there is little to no obfuscation within the packer; API calls such as VirtualAlloc\nand VirtualProtect are clearly visible, and there is no control flow obfuscation.\n\n## Ransomware Internals\n\nWe have observed two different samples of the HelloXD ransomware publicly available, indicating it is still under development by\nthe author(s). The first sample is fairly rudimentary, with minimal obfuscation and typically paired with an obfuscated loader\nresponsible for decrypting it through the use of the WinCrypt API before injecting it into memory. The second sample, on the\n\n\n-----\n\nother hand, is far more obfuscated, and is executed in memory by a packer rather than a full scale loader.\n\nWhile the obfuscation and execution may differ between the two, both samples contain very similar core functionality, due to the\nauthor copying the leaked Babuk/Babyk source code in order to develop the HelloXD ransomware (Figure 7). As a result, a lot of\nthe function structure overlaps with Babuk, after getting past the obfuscation.\n\n**Sample 1 - Windows** **Sample 2 - Windows**\n\nHashes 4a2ee1666e2e9c40d372853e2203a7f2336b6e03 1758a8db8485f7e70432c07a9e3d5c0bb5743889\n\nExecution Obfuscated Loader Packer\n\nAlgorithms Modified HC-128, Curve25519-Donna Rabbit Cipher, Curve25519-Donna\n\nObfuscation Minimal Control Flow\n\nFiles Generic Files Generic Files, MBR, Boot Files\n\n_Table 1. Ransomware sample comparison summary._\n\nFigure 7. Side-by-side of encryption function in Babuk (left) and HelloXD (right).\nWhile there is a lot of overlap between HelloXD and Babuk, there are some small but crucial differences to take note of between\nBabuk and the two different variants.\n\nHelloXD version 1 is the least modified, utilizing Curve25519-Donna and a modified HC-128 algorithm to encrypt file data, while\nalso containing the same CRC hashing routine incorporating the string dong, possibly referencing Chuong Dong, who had\npreviously analyzed and reported on the first version of Babuk (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8. HelloXD checksum calculation.\nThe HelloXD author(s) did modify the infamous file marker and mutex however, opting for dxunmgqehhehyrhtxywuhwrvzxqrcblo\nas the file marker and With best wishes And good intentions… as the mutex (Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Original HelloXD mutex.\nWith HelloXD version 2, the author(s) opted to alter the encryption routine, swapping out the modified HC-128 algorithm with the\n[Rabbit symmetric cipher. Additionally, the file marker changed again, this time to what seems to be random bytes rather than a](https://github.com/vbdaga/Rabbit-Cipher)\ncoherent string. The mutex is also modified, set to nqldslhumipyuzjnatqucmuycqkxjon in one of the samples (Figure 10).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Rabbit cipher.\nBoth versions have been compiled with the same compiler (believed to be GCC 3.x and above based on the mangling of export\nnames), resulting in very similar exports between not only the ransomware variants, but also other malware that we have linked\nto the potential author (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 11. Export tables revealing similar export naming conventions.\nThe biggest difference between the versions is the interesting addition of a secondary payload embedded within version 2. This\npayload is encrypted using the WinCrypt API, in the same fashion as the obfuscated loader discussed above. Once decrypted,\nthe payload is dropped to System32 with the name userlogin.exe before a service is created that points to it. userlogin.exe is\nthen executed (Figure 12).\n\nFigure 12. HelloXD decrypts and drops MicroBackdoor to userlogin.exe\nWhat is peculiar about this file is it is a variant of the open-source MicroBackdoor, a backdoor allowing an attacker to browse the\nfile system, upload and download files, execute commands and remove itself from the system (Figure 13). As the threat actor\nwould normally have a foothold into the network prior to ransomware deployment, it raises the question of why this backdoor is\npart of the ransomware execution. One possibility is that it is used to monitor ransomed systems for blue team and incident\nresponse (IR) activity, though even in that case it is unusual to see offensive tools dropped at this point in the infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. MicroBackdoor configuration.\n\n## WTFBBQ Pivots\n\nWhile analyzing the ransomware binaries, we discovered a unique string prevalent in almost all of the samples: :wtfbbq (stored\nas UTF-16LE). Querying VirusTotal with this string led to the discovery of eight files, six of which could be directly attributed to\nx4k through their own VirusTotal graph mapping out their infrastructure. The discovered samples are primarily Cobalt Strike\nBeacons, utilizing heavy control flow obfuscation – unlike the HelloXD ransomware samples we had previously seen.\n\nUnfortunately, this specific string is not completely unique to x4k, and is instead found on several GitHub repositories as part of a\ntechnique to allow a running executable to delete itself from disk through renaming primary data streams within the file to\n**:wtfbbq. Running a search for the non-UTF-16LE string results in multiple files, and filtering for executables yields 10 results, the**\n[majority of which are NIM-based binaries – potentially linked to this GitHub repository.](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim/blob/master/src/self_delete_bin.nim)\n\nWhile the :wtfbbq string is not unique to x4k, by searching for the UTF-16LE version found inside the analyzed HelloXD\nransomware samples, we only came across binaries linked to x4k’s infrastructure, providing a fairly strong link between HelloXD\nand x4k.\n\n## Hunting for Ransomware Attribution\n\nThe backdoor provided extremely useful insight into the potential threat actor behind the ransomware, as it had the following\nhardcoded IP address to use as the command and control (C2): 193[.]242[.]145[.]158. Upon navigating to this IP address, we\nobserved an email address – tebya@poime[.]li – on the page title, the first link in the chain of attribution (Figure 14).\n\nFigure 14. Site contents with the email address on the page title.\nUsing the email address as a pivot, we identified additional domains that were linked to tebya@poime[.]li.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain** **Email** **Phone** **Nameserver** **Registrar** **Country** **Created** **IP**\n\n\nx4k.us tebya@poime.li 19253078717 dns1.registrarservers.com;dns2.registrarservers.com;\n\n\nnamecheap,\ninc.\n\n\nNZ 202007-26\n\n\n167[.]86[.]87[.]27\n\n164[.]68[.]114[.]29\n\n\n1q.is tebya@poime.li 19253078717 forwarding00.isnic.is N/A NZ 202105-30\n\n_Table 2.

PDNS of 164[.]68[.]114[.]29 and 167[.]86[.]87[.]27_\n\nWhen looking at this infrastructure on VirusTotal, we observed that some of the domains we found were part of a VirusTotal\ngraph called a.y.e/ created by the user x4k on June 30, 2021. On this graph, we found his infrastructure mapped out and\nmalicious files that were also linked to the domains. This, however, was not the only graph we observed x4k creating. We also\nencountered additional graphs, mapping different things such as “Russian Hosts,” “DDoS Guard” and others, dating back to\nAugust 10, 2020 (Figure 15).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. x4k VirusTotal Graph created by x4k.\n[Additionally, we observed the initial email being linked to a GitHub account (Figure 16), as well as various forums including XSS,](https://github.com/x4kme)\na known Russian-speaking hacking forum created to share knowledge about exploits, vulnerabilities, malware and network\npenetration.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. x4k GitHub account.\nFrom the GitHub page, we also observed a URL to a site – xn--90a5ai[.]com(фсб[.]com) – resolving to the previously mentioned\nIP 164[.]68[.]114[.]29, which at this point in time only shows an animation of interconnecting points. That being said, when\nlooking at the HTML source code of the site, we discovered a couple of references to the user observed before – x4kme – and\nother aliases such as uKn0wn, which was observed in the HelloXD ransomware samples.\n\nFigure 17. Snippet of Script in HTML Source Code xn--90a5ai[.]comFrom the list of aliases used by the threat actor, we were\n[able to observe another GitHub account with the name l4ckyguy, sharing the profile picture, location and URL in the description,](https://github.com/l4ckyguy)\nwith a link to the previously observed account (x4kme), and a name, Ivan Topor, which we believe may be another alias for this\nthreat actor. A further account, [l4cky-control, was also discovered. This repository contained a Python script that would decrypt a](https://github.com/l4cky-control)\nsecondary Python script which reached out to the IP 167[.]86[.]87[.]27 to download and execute another Python script. This\nparticular IP was linked to a Contabo server that x4k had also included within their VirusTotal graph discussed above.\nWe also found a YouTube account linked to the actor through the initial email tebya@poime[.]li, using another alias, Vanya Topor.\nIt’s worth pointing out that “Vanya” is a diminutive for Ivan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. GitHub account for l4ckyguy\n\n(left) and YouTube account for Vanya Topor (right).\nThe YouTube account has no public videos, but we observed this threat actor sharing unlisted links in various hacking forums.\nThe content of the videos were tutorials and walkthroughs, where the threat actor showed his methodology of performing certain\nactions, depending on the video. The videos had no sound, but the threat actor would type commentary on a terminal to address\nsomething the viewer was observing on screen.\n\nThe videos found gave us insight into x4k operations before moving into ransomware activity specifically. We learned how this\nthreat actor leverages Cobalt Strike for his operations, including how to set up Beacons as well as how to send files to\ncompromised systems. In one of the videos, we actually observed the threat actor performing a DNS leak test on his Android\nphone. We also got to observe how the domain фсб[.]com used to look in October 2020 – a blog of sorts titled “Ghost in the\nWire.” Where the threat actor keeps alluding to his “Ghost” theme, a similar theme was observed in the HelloXD ransomware\nsamples (Figure 19).\n\nFigure 19. Screenshots of unlisted x4k\n\nYouTube videos.\nIn another video instance, we observed the threat actor submit a LockBit 2.0 sample on Cuckoo sandbox and compare the\nresults with another presumably LockBit 2.0 sample prior to the one submitted in the video. At the time of writing, we don’t\nbelieve x4k is related to LockBit 2.0 activity, but we did find the choice of this particular ransomware family interesting (Figure\n20). We also noticed this threat actor leveraging the use of other sandboxes besides Cuckoo – such as ANY.RUN and Hybrid\nAnalysis – to test out verdicts and tooling, alongside the use of various virtual machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20a. LockBit 2.0 samples executed on X4K YouTube video.\n\nFigure 20b. LockBit 2.0 samples executed on X4K YouTube video.\nAdditionally, this threat actor not only leverages open-source tooling, but also develops his own tools and scripts. We were able\nto see this threat actor demonstrating some of his tools performing automated actions in his videos, such as obfuscating files,\ncreating executables and code signing (Figure 21).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21. Custom scripts used by x4k\n\nTaking a closer look at x4k’s main OS, we believe it to be a customized Kali Linux instance, tailored to his needs. Most of his\nvideos, comments, configurations and tutorials are written in Russian – and when combined with knowledge gained from a few\nOPSEC mistakes – Russia is also where we believe x4k originates from. Additionally, we encountered the ClamAV logo during\none of the threat actor walkthrough videos – the same logo used on the HelloXD ransomware samples (Figure 22). This time\naround, x4k is using the logo as the start menu for his OS enviorment.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. ClamAV logo used in the threat\n\nactor’s personal environment.\nOn the same taskbar, we also noticed the Telegram icon, which is a very popular messaging app for chatting – but is also used\nby threat actors such as LAPSUS$ to post news into specific channels. Using his username and alias and pivot, we were able to\nidentify two Telegram accounts sharing the same picture as observed before, and descriptions pointing to the threat actor’s main\nsite фсб[.]com. We noticed that the x4k Telegram account is used actively versus the old account – which, according to\nTelegram, hasn’t been active in a while (Figure 23).\n\nFigure 23. Telegram accounts.\n\nx4k has a very solid online presence, which has enabled us to uncover much of his activity in these last two years. This threat\nactor has done little to hide malicious activity, and is probably going to continue this behavior.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnit 42 research encountered HelloXD, a ransomware family in its initial stages – but already intending to impact organizations.\nWhile the ransomware functionality is nothing new, during our research, following the lines, we found out the ransomware is most\nlikely developed by a threat actor named x4k. This threat actor is well known on various hacking forums, and seems to be of\nRussian origin. Unit 42 was able to uncover additional x4k activity being linked to malicious infrastructure, and additional\nmalware besides the initial ransomware sample, going back to 2020.\n\n[Ransomware is a lucrative operation if done correctly.
