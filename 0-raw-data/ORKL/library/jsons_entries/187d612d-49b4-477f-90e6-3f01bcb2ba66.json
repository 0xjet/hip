    "plain_text": "# Elizabethan England has nothing on modern-day Russia\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/privateer-groups.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/privateer-groups.html)**\n\n[This post was authored by Warren Mercer and](https://twitter.com/securitybeard) _[Vitor Ventura](https://twitter.com/_vventura)_\n\nThe threat landscape is changing. Organizations need to defend against an ever-evolving\ntranche of threat actors. For a long time, the lines that distinguish state-sponsored and\ncrimeware groups were well-defined. We believe this is no longer the case. In today's\nlandscape there are groups that although their modus operandi (MO) is consistent with\n\n\n-----\n\ncrimeware groups, act like state sponsored groups. This poses new challenges to the\ndefending organizations as these groups become more prevalent and dangerous which,\ndepending on the organization's risk profile, may require more attention.\n\nIn light of recent events, we believe it's time to recognize that a new category can be defined,\none where the ransomware syndicates enjoy some kind of protection from Governments,\neven if not intentionally. Therefore, Talos proposes the term \"privateers'' to describe actors\nwho benefit either from government decisions to turn a blind eye toward their activities or\nfrom more material support, but where the government doesn't necessarily exert direct\ncontrol over their actions. Which in itself does not diminish the responsibility these\ngovernments share with these groups by protecting them or simply allowing them to operate\nby turning a blind eye.\n\n## State-related threats\n\nIt's easy to split state-related actors in two main categories: ones that have been directly\nassociated with state structures, like the U.S.'s National Security Agency, APT28, APT29,\nAPT1, and the ones that, in spite of not being directly associated with a specific state, there\nis a common agreement in the infosec community that they benefit from decisions that the\nstate makes to support them.\n\nThe first kind of groups' (tier one) motivations, usually, are not monetary, and as such, they\ndon't have a monetization scheme. They usually have small infrastructure, which is\ncompletely destroyed once the campaign ends or is somehow exposed. These are groups\nthat try to make their operations as stealthy as possible that don't want to attract attention to\n[themselves. In specific operations like SolarWinds,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/12/solarwinds-supplychain-coverage.html) [CCleaner or](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/ccleaner-c2-concern.html) [VPNFilter they act as](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)\nstealthy as possible in the preparation/reconnaissance stage, knowing that the final act will\nprobably expose them, hoping to execute as much as possible their agenda before exposure\nhappens.\n\nAs one example of the second category (tier two), look at Gamaredon (or Armageddon or\nArma, as some know them). The group is complex, originating from Ukraine in the wake of\nRussia's annexation of Crimea. They are not part of the traditional Russian intelligence\napparatus, but we have high confidence that much of the intelligence they gather from their\noperations are passed to Russian interests. In this case, we have a state-related threat that\nisn't an element of the sponsoring state, but receives active support and direction from that\nstate sponsor.\n\nGamaredon do not pinpoint their victims, quite the opposite they target large swaths of users.\nTheir infrastructure is massive — they have hundreds of domains — and they do not\nsignificantly change their malware or infrastructure despite being exposed. However, they\nshare the non-deterrence aspect of the tier one groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are two other categories that are state related; Mercenary groups that a state can\nhire to perform specific actions and \"privateer\" groups we detail in the next section.\nMercenary groups can often fall into the first tier of state-related categories based on the\nexact campaign they're asked to carry out, so we will not be detailing those here.\n\n## The \"Privateer\" groups\n\nPrivateer groups are not sponsored directly by a state and are financially motivated, but they\ndo benefit from direct or indirect protection from that state. This frequently manifests as a\nlack of law enforcement action, even when requested through normal channels by other\ncountries. The protecting state doesn't receive direct benefit from these groups, but it is\nshielded from their activities, which frequently target the geopolitical adversaries of the\nprotecting state. There is also the possibility that the protecting state may pressure the\nprivateer group to engage in specific actions or target specific entities.\n\nThe only other kind of actors that have this level of protection are the ones that operate\ndirectly on a state structure. For example, actors the U.S. Department of Justice charged for\na cyber attack on credit reporting agency Equifax had direct connections to the China's\n[People's Liberation Army PLA 54th Research Institute. The DOJ has carried out other](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-military-personnel-charged-computer-fraud-economic-espionage-and-wire-fraud-hacking)\nindictments against state-sponsored actors including the Lazarus Group, a North Korean\n[citizen involved in the WannaCry incident and the six GRU officers involved in several cases](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and)\nof computer hacking.\n\nDarkSide could be considered one such \"privateer\" group. This ransomware family, which\n[was recently responsible for targeting a major oil pipeline in the U.S., checks the target's](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/05/11/joint-cisa-fbi-cybersecurity-advisory-darkside-ransomware)\nkeyboard configuration to avoid any user whose keyboard is in the Cyrillic language. Lockbit\ncould also be considred a privateer group, given that an operator for that group told Talos\nthat they would [not target Russia or any Russian-allied countries.](https://talosintelligence.com/resources/152)\n\nIt is worth noting that, historically, no ransomware operator has ever been detained in any of\nthe Commonwealth of Independent Countries (CIS) as long has they don't target its member\nstates. However, if a ransomware group targets any of these countries they will be\ninvestigated and taken down. An example of one such group is Lurk, which was linked to the\n[Angler exploit kit. The operator behind Lurk was arrested in Russia after the group targeted](https://talosintelligence.com/angler-exposed)\nRussian banks.\n\nThese groups usually fall in the crimeware category, however, we propose that they are not\nsimple crimeware gangs. These are highly organized groups, with a plethora of support\nservices they provide to their affiliates. Their operations and lack of deterrence from their\nhome state makes them a persistent threat to the community. This cannot be said for typical\nspammers or ordinary password stealers. \"Privateers\" are in the \"big game hunting\" space,\nexfiltrating hundreds of gigabytes of information This indicates a certain level of\n\n\n-----\n\nsophistication. Although they don t stack up to top-tier state-sponsored groups, privateer\ngroups are far more sophisticated than regular crimeware groups and should be identified as\nsuch.\n\n## \"Privateer\" groups criteria\n\nSince we are introducing a new classification, we felt it appropriate to outline what makes a\ngroup a \"privateer\" in Talos' eyes. We have decided on the following criteria to identify when\na group should be considered a privateer. There may be other considerations, but at a\nminimum, we believe the following must be met:\n\n1. Benefit from, either directly or indirectly, state protection and/or tolerance.\n2. The country does not cooperate with foreign law enforcement, intelligence services or\n\noffer extradition.\n3. Big-game hunting victimology ie; large enterprise or governmental organisations.\n4. It must have a sophisticated organization, i.e. has affiliates or third parties involved.\n5. Potential for societal disturbance.\n\nWe are aware that some groups may not specifically check every box here and there is\npotential for this criteria to change. The privateer group should remain exclusive to actors\nwho meet the aforementioned criteria.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe term \"APT\" has a broad meaning that's being used in more loose terms nowadays. This\nterm often includes the state-sponsored groups. However, we believe state-sponsored\nshould be referred as state-related and be split into three distinct categories: ones working\non behalf of specific state organizations, ones closely related to state actors, but with no\nclear organization affiliation and with no apparent financial motivation, and, finally, ones that\nare not directly related to state organizations but benefit from state protection, directly or\nindirectly.\n\nThe first tier includes actors like the Lazarus Group (aka APT38), a state-sponsored actor\ncarrying out attacks for direct gains for a nation-state. The second tier includes groups like\nGamaredon and PROMETHIUM. These groups don't seem to be directly linked to state\norganizations but are believed to work for states. These don't share the same level of\nsophistication as prime APTs but are not primarily financially motivated.\n\nFinally, we have groups like the DarkSide syndicate that we are referring to as \"privateers.\"\nPrivateers benefit from a certain level of state protection or acceptance without any real links\nto the states. These privateer groups are becoming increasingly prevalent and will likely\nsignificantly change the threat landscape in the years to come.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
