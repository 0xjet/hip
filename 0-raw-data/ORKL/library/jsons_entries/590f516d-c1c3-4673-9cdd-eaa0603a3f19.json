The campaign is linked to a\ngroup of suspected Chinese cyber espionage actors we have tracked since 2013, dubbed\n[TEMP.Periscope. The group has also been reported as “Leviathan” by other security firms.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leviathan-espionage-actor-spearphishes-maritime-and-defense-targets)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since summer 2017. Like multiple other\nChinese cyber espionage actors, TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged and has been observed\nconducting operations with a revised toolkit. Known targets of this group have been involved in the\nmaritime industry, as well as engineering-focused entities, and include research institutes, academic\norganizations, and private firms in the United States. FireEye products have robust detection for the\nmalware used in this campaign.\n\n**TEMP.Periscope Background**\n\nActive since at least 2013, TEMP.Periscope has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across\nmultiple verticals, including engineering firms, shipping and transportation, manufacturing, defense,\ngovernment offices, and research universities. However, the group has also targeted\nprofessional/consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare, and media/publishing. Identified victims\nwere mostly found in the United States, although organizations in Europe and at least one in Hong\nKong have also been affected. TEMP.Periscope overlaps in targeting, as well as tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs), with TEMP.Jumper, a group that also overlaps significantly with public reporting\non “NanHaiShu.”\n\n**TTPs and Malware Used**\n\nIn their recent spike in activity, TEMP.Periscope has leveraged a relatively large library of malware\nshared with multiple other suspected Chinese groups. These tools include:\n\nAIRBREAK: a JavaScript-based backdoor also reported as “Orz” that retrieves commands from\nhidden strings in compromised webpages and actor controlled profiles on legitimate services.\nBADFLICK: a backdoor that is capable of modifying the file system, generating a reverse shell,\nand modifying its command and control (C2) configuration.\nPHOTO: a DLL backdoor also reported publicly as “Derusbi”, capable of obtaining directory, file,\nand drive listing; creating a reverse shell; performing screen captures; recording video and audio;\nlisting, terminating, and creating processes; enumerating, starting, and deleting registry keys and\nvalues; logging keystrokes, returning usernames and passwords from protected storage; and\nrenaming, deleting, copying, moving, reading, and writing to files.\nHOMEFRY: a 64-bit Windows password dumper/cracker that has previously been used in\nconjunction with AIRBREAK and BADFLICK backdoors. Some strings are obfuscated with XOR\nx56. The malware accepts up to two arguments at the command line: one to display cleartext\ncredentials for each login session, and a second to display cleartext credentials, NTLM hashes,\nand malware version for each login session.\nLUNCHMONEY: an uploader that can exfiltrate files to Dropbox.\nMURKYTOP: a command-line reconnaissance tool. It can be used to execute files as a different\nuser, move, and delete files locally, schedule remote AT jobs, perform host discovery on\nconnected networks, scan for open ports on hosts in a connected network, and retrieve\ninformation about the OS, users, groups, and shares on remote hosts.\nChina Chopper: a simple code injection webshell that executes Microsoft .NET code within HTTP\nPOST commands. This allows the shell to upload and download files, execute applications with\nweb server account permissions, list directory contents, access Active Directory, access\ndatabases, and any other action allowed by the .NET runtime.\n\nThe following are tools that TEMP.Periscope has leveraged in past operations and could use again,\nthough these have not been seen in the current wave of activity:\n\n\n-----\n\nBeacon: a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike software platform,\ncommonly used for pen-testing network environments. The malware supports several capabilities,\nsuch as injecting and executing arbitrary code, uploading and downloading files, and executing\nshell commands.\n[BLACKCOFFEE: a backdoor that obfuscates its communications as normal traffic to legitimate](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/05/hiding_in_plain_sigh.html)\n[websites such as Github and Microsoft's Technet portal. Used by APT17 and other Chinese cyber](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/apt17-hiding-in-plain-sight-fireeye-and-microsoft-expose-obfuscation-tactic)\nespionage operators.\n\nAdditional identifying TTPs include:\n\nSpear phishing, including the use of probably compromised email accounts.\nLure documents using CVE-2017-11882 to drop malware.\nStolen code signing certificates used to sign malware.\nUse of bitsadmin.exe to download additional tools.\nUse of PowerShell to download additional tools.\nUsing C:\\Windows\\Debug and C:\\Perflogs as staging directories.\nLeveraging Hyperhost VPS and Proton VPN exit nodes to access webshells on internet-facing\nsystems.\n[Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence.](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/wp-windows-management-instrumentation.pdf)\nUsing Windows Shortcut files (.lnk) in the Startup folder that invoke the Windows Scripting Host\n(wscript.exe) to execute a Jscript backdoor for persistence.\nReceiving C2 instructions from user profiles created by the adversary on legitimate\nwebsites/forums such as Github and Microsoft's TechNet portal.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe current wave of identified intrusions is consistent with TEMP.Periscope and likely reflects a\nconcerted effort to target sectors that may yield information that could provide an economic advantage,\nresearch and development data, intellectual property, or an edge in commercial negotiations.\n\nAs we continue to investigate this activity, we may identify additional data leading to greater analytical\nconfidence linking the operation to TEMP.Periscope or other known threat actors, as well as previously\nunknown campaigns.\n\n**Indicators**\n\n_File_ _Hash_ _Description_\n\nx.js 3fefa55daeb167931975c22df3eca20a HOMEFRY, a 64-bit Windows password\ndumper/cracker\n\nmt.exe 40528e368d323db0ac5c3f5e1efe4889 MURKYTOP, a command-line reconnaissance\ntool\n\ncom4.js a68bf5fce22e7f1d6f999b7a580ae477 AIRBREAK, a JavaScript-based backdoor which\nretrieves commands from hidden strings in\ncompromised webpages\n\n\n-----\n\n**Historical Indicators**\n\n_File_ _Hash_ _Description_\n\ngreen.ddd 3eb6f85ac046a96204096ab65bbd3e7e AIRBREAK,\na JavaScriptbased\nbackdoor\nwhich\nretrieves\ncommands\nfrom hidden\nstrings in\ncompromised\nwebpages\n\nBGij 6e843ef4856336fe3ef4ed27a4c792b1 Beacon, a\ncommercially\navailable\nbackdoor\n\nmsresamn.ttf a9e7539c1ebe857bae6efceefaa9dd16 PHOTO, also\nreported as\nDerusbi\n\n\n1024aa6a121f98330df2edee6c4391df21ff43a33604\n\n\nbd9e4c82bf12c4e7a58221fc52fed705 BADFLICK,\nbackdoor that\nis capable of\nmodifying the\nfile system,\ngenerating a\nreverse shell,\nand\nmodifying its\ncommandand-control\nconfiguration\n\n\n-----",
