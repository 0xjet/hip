This malware family had remained undetected for over two years and was delivered via\na unique downloader named Carp Downloader. Since that publication, we have continued to\nmonitor this threat, resulting in the discovery of a series of attacks using an updated version\nof Cardinal RAT. A series of modifications have been made to the RAT, many of which are\nused to evade detection and hinder analysis.\n\nWe witnessed attacks targeting the financial technology (FinTech) sector, primarily focused\non organizations based in Israel. While researching these attacks, we discovered a possible\nrelationship between Cardinal RAT and another malware family named EVILNUM. EVILNUM\nis a JavaScript-based malware family that is used in attacks against similar organizations.\n\n## Cardinal RAT Employs BMP Trick\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the original discovery of Cardinal RAT, the attackers have made some minor\nupdates that are worth discussing, particularly regarding obfuscation techniques. For the\nsake of this analysis we’ll look at the most recent version of Cardinal RAT:\n\n**SHA256** b742162197744a8caeb09f954213a3172ed699f8375f69c40b57b8c219c5e37c\n\nThe last time [we wrote about Cardinal RAT in 2017, we looked at version 1.4 of the malware](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-cardinal-rat-active-two-years/)\nfamily. We identify this latest sample as version 1.7.2 based on information within the\npayload. Unlike previously discussed samples, this latest instance of Cardinal RAT employs\nvarious obfuscation techniques to hinder analysis of the underlying code. The first layer of\nobfuscation comes in the form of steganography; the initial sample is compiled with .NET\nand contains an embedded bitmap (BMP) file.\n\n_Figure 1. Embedded BMP file contained within .NET loader_\n\nUpon execution, the malware will read this file, parse out pixel data from the image, and\ndecrypt the result using a single-byte XOR key. We have provided a Python script to\nautomate this process in the Appendix of the blog post. The result is a DLL also compiled\nwith .NET, with the following hash:\n\n**SHA256** 01e007b8304eb0cbcb2be11ddb86298dc85c084fb5459eda319a69ef50799f88\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter this file has been loaded in memory, the initial loader will load and execute the\n‘corerun’ function, initiating the second stage of the malware. The DLL begins by performing\n[a sleep using the built-in Windows choice utility:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_(command))\n\ncmd.exe /c choice /C Y /N /D Y /T 20\n\nThe command prompts the user for a choice with a 20 second timeout, at which point the\nprocess will exit. Since the window is hidden, and there is no utility for this choice,\nthe malware simply uses this as an alternative sleep command.\n\nThe second stage DLL reads in the ‘strings’ embedded resource from the first stage\nexecutable. Part of this resource is decrypted to provide configuration information to the\ndropper. This configuration information will instruct whether or not the malware enters its\ninstallation routine. In the installation routine, it begins by writing a unique GUID identifier to\n%TEMP%\\[random].ini. Afterwards, it creates the following directory:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\IEConfig\n\nIt then writes an embedded executable with the hash below to %TEMP%\\[random].exe. This\nfile has an internal filename of RunExecutive.exe and simply copies the contents of\nargument #2 to the file path specified in argument #1.\n\n**SHA256** 2167d393ec89ec0c6e2d7557a7ad22aa1953dd8082f599bee14977c25a128cce\n\nThe malware creates an LNK file in the victim’s startup folder with a randomly\ngenerated filename using a GUID (Example: {fcb29182-b3cc-47e2-a95cb22c6d87dda1}.lnk). The LNK file executes the following command:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden\n\"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\IEConfig\\[random]\\sqlreader.exe\"\n\nFinally, the malware will execute the previously written RunExecutive executable with\narguments to copy the original executable to the previously referenced sqlreader.exe file\npath.\n\nThe remaining segment of the embedded resource is decrypted using a 16-byte XOR key,\nresulting in a .NET executable. This executable is injected into one of the following two\nlegitimate executables or processes on the system:\n\nRegSvcs.exe\n\nRegAsm.exe\n\nIn previous versions of this malware family, there were a larger number of legitimate\nprocesses Cardinal RAT would inject into. The final payload has the following hash:\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** 04de4b51c881e65236c9efdbfbc0099e6b48fd1723a6e51bf480b52104dd2ba2\n\nUnderneath all this obfuscation, this Cardinal RAT payload does not have any significant\nchanges compared to the previously discussed version in terms of its operation or\ncapabilities. One of the most significant changes lies in the obfuscation used by the\nmalware; all of the functions, methods, and variables have been renamed to MD5 hashes.\n\n_Figure 2. Obfuscation present in Cardinal RAT payload_\n\nIn addition to the obfuscation routines in use, there have been a few minor changes within\nthe malware itself. First, the embedded configuration has a few changes both in the order of\nthe embedded values, as well as what values are present. Additionally, the way this\nconfiguration is encoded has changed slightly, as several values that were previously base\n64 encoded in version 1.4 are no longer base64-encoded.\n\n$ python parseConfig.py GreyCardinalConfig\n\nMutex: {509ce3ef-e03e-467e-be19-710782f13c28}\n\nCampaign Identifier: '\\xf1\\xaf\\x02i.]\\xa4\\xe0'\n\nC2 Server: affiliatecollective[.]club\n\nC2 Port: 443\n\nHash Value: 0304674e9876530dfbea5a9b4fec7b98\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional C2 Servers: 0\n\nGUID: '\\xd6\\x04hr\\x9a\\xedLN\\xae\\xe8\\xd0\\x87\\x80\\x19\\x15z'\n\nBuffer Size: 81920\n\nMax Buffer Size: 40960000\n\nSleep Timer Between Requests: 2000\n\nUnused Integer: 60000\n\nUnused Integer: 0\n\nPerform Keylogging: 0\n\nDisable Sleep on Victim: 0\n\nNetwork communication and actions available to the remote operator remain consistent\nbetween versions. The script provided in our previous report continues to work as expected\nagainst the network traffic generated by this malware family. The following actions continue\nto be present within the malware:\n\nCollect victim information\nUpdate settings\nAct as a reverse proxy\nExecute command\nUninstall itself\nRecover passwords\nDownload and Execute new files\nKeylogging\nCapture screenshots\nUpdate Cardinal RAT\nClean cookies from browsers\n\n## Enter EVILNUM\n\nWhen looking at files submitted by the same customer in a similar timeframe to the\nCardinal RAT samples, we saw that the customer had also submitted a malware family we’d\nbeen tracking as EVILNUM. From our viewpoint this is another family that seems to be used\nsolely in attacks against finance related organisations.\n\nWhen we cross-referenced submissions to online sandboxes, we found an\nadditional case to ours, where another organization had submitted both EVILNUM and\nCardinal RAT on the same day; both of which are rare malware families with limited\ndistribution\n\n\n-----\n\nWe opted to use the name EVILNUM, since in some versions of the malware the C2 is\n[calculated by reading the page, parsing a numerical value, dividing it by 666 and then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast)\nconverting the resulting decimal to an IP address. There are at least two versions of this\nmalware, one written in JavaScript, and another written in .NET.\n\n**SHA256** **Type**\n\nbee6c5a506d6fb2cc129443c74b7676fbb9a79b53b92b2cac4c7fb8209592714 .NET\n\n97c97ad2baef37eea023549131c192f441aa7976747166cd31095e7dad17948c JS\n\nDespite the differences in programming language used, the samples are similar, and we\nbelieve the .NET edition is likely a rewrite of the .JS version.\n\n[EVILNUM has been covered in the public domain previously (albeit with no name assigned](http://www.pwncode.club/2018/05/javascript-based-bot-using-github-c.html)\n[to the malware family) and has been noticed by multiple analysts on Twitter. It’s a first-](https://twitter.com/KorbenD_Intel/status/1068560640359481345)\nstage malware family which gives an attacker data about the infected host before they\ndecide to install other utilities on the machine. EVILNUM’s supported commands vary from\nversion to version and include but are not limited to:\n\nSetting up persistence\nRun an arbitrary command using “cmd /c”\nDownload of additional files\nAbility to take screenshots\n\nSince the operation of the malware is well covered already in the pwncode article, we’ll\nsimply illustrate a few of the differences and similarities between the older and newer\nversions of the malware in the table below:\n\n**[May 2018 version](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/0713c5c3db572d88b08d527533cb07d25d33c1c7535cf59075e693b4fefba1fc/analysis/)** **[January 2019 version](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/97c97ad2baef37eea023549131c192f441aa7976747166cd31095e7dad17948c/analysis/)**\n\nVersion # 1.3 2.1\n\n\nC2s used Public Forums/Git, find number,\ndivide by 666, num2ip\n\n\nPublic Forums/Git, find number,\ndivide by 8, num2ip\n\n\nFunctionality to steal\nlocal cookies\n\n\nn y\n\n\nUse of Lock file y y\n\n\nAdds to Startup as\nLNK?\n\nAdd to startup\nmethod?\n\n\ny y\n\nvia cmd line By importing a reg file\n\n\n-----\n\nFunction naming this_function ThisFunction\n\n\nAbility to take\nscreenshots\n\n\nn y\n\n\n_Table 1. Highlights of the similarities (in green) and differences (in red) between EVILNUM_\n_versions_\n\nThe malware appears to have been given a general rewrite, (as indicated by the authors’\nversion number) with many functions being rewritten from scratch.\n\nDespite this, the core functionality of the malware is mostly the same, and some of the\nconcepts used in the malware family (such as the lock file) remain the same. It’s likely that\nthe malware only serves as a first stage and the attackers deploy further tools to target\nnetworks of interest.\n\n## Targeting\n\nSince April 2017, we have observed Cardinal RAT in attacks against two customers, both\ncustomers were FinTech companies who write software relating to forex and\ncryptocurrency trading, and both companies were based in Israel. Looking at submissions\nto VirusTotal, there are 13 Carp Downloader documents. Note that we are only looking at\nsubmissions for “entry” type files, not subsequent dropped files. When looking at the first\nsubmitters for these documents in Figure 1, we see they are predominantly uploaded from\nIsrael.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Distribution by country for Carp Downloader submissions to VirusTotal_\n\nIn the case of EVILNUM, we have only seen one instance at a customer (the same one we\nreferred to earlier in this article). When it comes to investigations from public sandboxes\nthough, the distribution of the initial files used in infections is most commonly via LNK\nfiles. The geographical distribution of first submitters for EVILNUM is quite different, as\nshown in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Distribution by country for EVILNUM submissions to VirusTotal_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCardinal RAT and EVILNUM are both used in limited distribution attacks against FinTech\ncompanies. In one case, both families were observed at the same target in a short space of\ntime, whilst droppers for both families share similarly themed lure documents.\n\nWe suggest that these families are used in targeted attacks against FinTech companies\nbecause:\n\nOur telemetry shows these families are only used against companies in this sector.\nThe lure documents used consistently related to lists of names/numbers of individuals\ninvolved in trading forex/crypto currency, a niche theme to use if targeting individuals\noutside of this sector.\n\nWe believe it’s possible that both families are used by the same attackers because:\n\nWe know of two cases where a company was targeted or appears to have been\ntargeted by both malware families in short succession.\nBoth families have been distributed using malicious documents containing lists of\nnames/numbers of individuals involved in trading forex/crypto currency.\nThe differences in geographical distribution can be easily explained as a difference in\nvisibility.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, there are a number of arguments against the two families being related:\n\nIn terms of the geographic spread of where these families are seen, the targeting for\neach family seems to be quite different.\nThe delivery methods for each family do not share any similarities.\nThe infrastructure associated with each malware family is distinctive and different\nwith no cross-over in terms of hosting providers or other attributes being observed.\n\nEven if the two families are not linked, they both have similar targeting interests, and so\nFinTech organisations should ensure they are protected against the malware used. Whilst we\nhaven’t been able to gain an insight into what the attackers do once successfully on a target\nnetwork, it’s likely (based on the targets) they use their access to facilitate financial gain.\n\nOrganizations with effective spam filtering, proper system administration, and up-to-date\nWindows hosts have a much lower risk of infection. Generic defenses against these threats\ninclude:\n\nDo not allow inbound e-mails with LNK file as attachments, or, do not allow inbound emails with attached ZIP files containing a single LNK file inside them.\nDo not allow inbound e-mails from external sources where the documents contain\nmacros, or, if you do, [ensure proper policy is configured.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enable-or-disable-macros-in-office-files-12b036fd-d140-4e74-b45e-16fed1a7e5c6?redirectSourcePath=%252farticle%252fEnable-or-disable-macros-in-Office-documents-7b4fdd2e-174f-47e2-9611-9efe4f860b12&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)\n[Enforce
