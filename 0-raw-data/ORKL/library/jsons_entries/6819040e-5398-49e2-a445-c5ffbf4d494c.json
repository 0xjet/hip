Although the group’s exact motives remain unclear, its initial tranche of information\n[exposed individuals connected to long-running GOTHIC PANDA (APT3) operations, culminating in a connection to the Chinese firm Boyusec](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2017/05/09/apt3-is-boyusec-a-chinese-intelligence-contractor/)\n(博御信息) and, ultimately, Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) entities in Guangzhou.\n\nRecently, in July and August 2018, IntrusionTruth has returned with new reporting regarding actors with ties to historic STONE PANDA\n[(APT10) activity and has ultimately associated them with the MSS Tianjin Bureau (天津市国家安全局). Though CrowdStrike® Falcon](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/apt10-was-managed-by-the-tianjin-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\nIntelligence™ is currently unable to confirm all of the details provided in these most recent posts with a high degree of confidence, several key\npieces of information can be verified.\n\nSeveral of the named individuals have been active registering domains as recently as June 2018, and they responded to the\nIntrusionTruth blog posts by scrubbing their social media or by following IntrusionTruth’s Twitter account.\nNamed individuals ZHANG Shilong and GAO Qiang have significant connections to known Chinese hacking forums, and they have\nsourced tools currently in use by China-based cyber adversaries.\nZHANG has registered several sites with overlapping registrant details that show both his affiliation with several physical technology firm\naddresses as well as his residence in Tianjin.\nNamed firm Huaying Haitai has been connected to a Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) sponsored attack\nand defense competition; this is similar to GOTHIC PANDA’s ties to an active defense lab sponsored by China Information Technology\nEvaluation Center (CNITSEC).\nHuaying Haitai has previously hired Chinese students with Japanese language skills; this is significant, as STONE PANDA has engaged\nin several campaigns targeting Japanese firms.\nThe MSS Tianjin Bureau is confirmed to be located at the described address, not far from many of the registrant addresses listed by\nZHANG as well the firms GAO was likely recruiting for.\n\nMore details that may further illuminate these findings and provide a higher confidence in connecting STONE PANDA to the MSS Tianjin\nBureau are likely to emerge.\n\n### Background\n\nThroughout May 2017, using a variety of historical information and open-source intelligence (OSINT), IntrusionTruth released several blog\n[posts identifying several](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2017/05/02/who-is-mr-wu/) [individuals connected to Boyusec. Though CrowdStrike’s](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2017/05/05/who-is-mr-dong/) [Threat Intelligence team had suspected GOTHIC PANDA](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)\n[was an MSS contractor for several years, the IntrusionTruth posts and subsequent research by RecordedFuture into MSS ties to the China](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-behind-apt3/)\nInformation Technology Evaluation Center (CNITSEC/中国信息安全测评中心) corroborated additional details from various sources and\nprovided a higher degree of confidence. Confidence in these findings was further boosted when the U.S. Department of Justice named\n[Boyusec and several of the described individuals in an indictment, and detailed GOTHIC PANDA tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1013866/download)\ndetail.\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence was able to independently verify the majority of this information and concluded that not only is CNITSEC\nassociated with the MSS, but its former director WU Shizhong (吴世忠) was simultaneously dual-hatted as the director of the MSS\nTechnology/13th Bureau (国家安全部科技局局长)1 2 3, implying that the MSS plays a crucial role in China’s code review of foreign products and\n\n\n-----\n\ns o ab e to c e y p c g a ue u e ab t es o ts o capab e do est c bug u t g tea s C S C s o e code e e o\n[foreign entities has led to its access to Microsoft’s source code dating back to 2003 and the use by KRYPTONITE PANDA of a high-value](https://news.microsoft.com/2003/09/26/china-information-technology-security-certification-center-source-code-review-lab-opened/)\nvulnerability (CVE-2018-0802), discovered by Chinese firm Qihoo 360, a month before it was publicly revealed.\n\nWU Shizhong Presenting on the “Digital Silk Road” at the Second Wuzhen World Internet Conference in 2015\n\nAs research into the IntrusionTruth leads on STONE PANDA continues, Falcon Intelligence has already observed some consistencies with\nknown MSS operations.\n\n### Sinking Like a STONE \n\n**GAO Qiang (高/郜** 强)\n\nMany of the personal details for GAO were scrubbed shortly after IntrusionTruth’s post [introducing him went live, including his Tencent QQ](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/02/who-is-mr-gao/)\naccount. The blog connects him to the moniker fisherxp via an initial spear-phishing campaign from 2010 previously\nattributed to STONE PANDA. Multiple sites with profile pictures appear to show the owner of the fisherxp accounts,\nthough this has yet to be independently confirmed as GAO. Fisherxp’s QQ shows his alternate username as 肥猪 or\n“big porker”. IntrusionTruth later links GAO to several [documented Uber rides to the MSS Tianjin Bureau’s office](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/apt10-was-managed-by-the-tianjin-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\naddress where both his first name, Qiang/强, and 猪 are used by the app to identify him and tie him to the QQ number\n420192. CrowdStrike cannot confirm the validity of these Uber receipts at this time.\n\nHowever, fisherxp’s account on popular Chinese technology forum 51CTO is still active and shows that he has\ndownloaded not only the open-source DarkComet RAT and numerous password cracking tools, but more importantly,\nseveral favorite tools used by a plethora of known Chinese cyber adversaries including Gh0st RAT 3.6, zxarps (an\nARP-spoofing tool by legacy hacker LZX), and lcx.exe (a port-forwarding tool by legacy hacker LCX) .4\n\n**ZHANG Shilong (张世龙)**\n\n[ZHANG was originally introduced by IntrusionTruth as a reciprocal follower of fisherxp’s Twitter account via his own @baobeilong account.](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/06/who-is-mr-zhang/)\n_Baobeilong (宝贝龙/”Baby Dragon”) also maintained a GitHub account that had forked both the Quasar and Trochilus_\nRATs, two open-source tools historically used by STONE PANDA, but the account has since been scrubbed. This\ninformation was verified by CrowdStrike before being removed completely. Falcon Intelligence recently independently\nconducted detailed analysis of the RedLeaves malware used to target numerous Japanese defense groups and\nfound it was directly sourced from Trochilus code, but it has undergone several evolutions and contains prefixes\nsuggesting it could also be used to target Russia and the DPRK. There is no conclusive evidence at this time that\nRedLeaves is solely attributed to STONE PANDA.\n\n_Baobeilong did maintain a Flickr account with numerous pictures that proved key in identifying his location later,_\nsimilar to how cpyy’s photos helped identify his affiliation to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in CrowdStrike’s\n[PUTTER PANDA report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hat-tribution-pla-unit-61486/)\n\nIntrusionTruth then drew connections from baobeilong’s other online accounts to registrant details for xiaohong[.]org, which dated back to 2007\nand revealed ZHANG’s full name—ZHANG Shilong. From there, a trail of overlapping registrant details reveals ZHANG’s hanzi characters for\nhis name (张世龙), likely one of his personal home addresses, potential work addresses and several email addresses:\n\nlong@xiaohong[.]org\nbaobei@xiaohong[ ]org\n\n\n-----\n\nat ee p@ya oo[ ]co c\nrobin4700@foxmail[.]com\neshilong@vip.qq[.]com\n\nSpecifically tracing registrant details from atreexp → robin4700 → eshilong shows that ZHANG was active registering sites as recently as June\n5, 2018, including a personal blog where his picture and name features prominently along with several technology-related blog posts.\n\nA picture from baobeilong’s Flickr account shows a fire at the Tianjin Medical Center 120\n\n**Laoying Baichen Instruments**\n\nThe original blog post on GAO lists his contact information in recruitment postings for two separate companies, one of which is Laoying\nBaichen Instruments (characters unknown at the time of this writing). No records could be found for such a firm, however, IntrusionTruth lists\nthe address associated with it as Room 1102, Guanfu Mansion, 46 Xinkai Road, Hedong District, Tianjin (天津市河东区新开路46号冠福大厦\n1102).\n\nDuring the course of investigating Laoying and the Guanfu mansion, Falcon Intelligence noticed that the Guanfu Mansion is also the registered\naddress of a firm called Tianjin Henglide Technology Co., Ltd. (恒利德天津科技有限公司), which is listed as one of only a few “review centers”\ncertified by CNITSEC in Tianjin . Laoying and Henglide are listed as being on different floors, however having a CNITSEC review center in the5\nsame building is noteworthy given CNITSEC’s connection to MSS and previous linkage to Boyusec/GOTHIC PANDA.\n\n\n-----\n\nZhang is believed to have taken the photo of the fire from the Wanchan Meizhuan Mansion. This is relatively close to both the Yuyang Complex (one of\n\nZhang’s listed registrant addresses) and the Guanfu Mansion, Laoying Baichen’s listed address.\n\n**Tianjin Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company**\n\nThe other firm GAO appears to have been recruiting for is Huaying Haitai (天津华盈海泰科技发展有限公司). As the IntrusionTruth blog post\nmentions, it is a registered firm with two listed representatives, Fang Ting (方亭) and Sun Lei (孙杰), and a listed address of 1906 Fuyu\nMansion (天津市河西区解放南路中段西侧富裕大厦1-1906).\n\nSearches for more information on Huaying Haitai turned up two interesting government documents. One is a recruitment Excel sheet detailing\nrecent graduates, their majors and their new employers and addresses. Huaying Haitai is listed as having hired a recently graduated female\nstudent from Nankai University in 2013 who majored in Japanese. This is interesting considering STONE PANDA’s extensive targeting of\nJapanese defense firms after this time period, but it is by no means conclusive evidence that the firm is connected to STONE PANDA.\n\nThe second government document lists Huaying Haitai as the co-organizer of a Network Security Attack and Defense competition with the\nMinistry of Industry and Information Technology’s (MIIT) national training entity, NSACE . It was open for all students of Henan Province.6\n\n\nNSACE appears to be a national education body that teaches network information security, including offensive activity . This information is7\nparticularly interesting given Boyusec’s previous work at CNITSEC’s Guangdong subsidiary setting up a joint active defense lab . It suggests8\nthat these technology firms act as both shell companies and recruitment grounds for potential MSS use in cyber operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n### MSS Tianjin Bureau\n\nThe most recent IntrusionTruth post assesses that GAO’s Uber rides frequently took him from Huaying’s address at the Fuyu Mansion to 85\nZhujiang Road (珠江道85号).\n\nWhen observed closely, the compound is a striking one complete with towers, a fenced perimeter with surveillance cameras, guarded\nentrances, and a building with a significant number of satellite dishes.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are no markers on the building and no government listed address; however, it is apparently difficult for locals to determine where the\nTianjin Bureau’s location is as well. There are several Baidu questions asking what transportation routes are best to get to that specific\naddress. Three separate ones specifically mention the 85 Zhujiang Road address as the headquarters for the MSS’s Tianjin Bureau and the\ndifficulty in finding its location9 10 11.\n\nAs with most cyber-enabled operations, satellite arrays are often indicative of installations with significant signals intelligence (SIGINT)\ncapabilities. The Tianjin Bureau appears to have the potential for such capabilities, housing several large arrays that appear to have existed\nsince at least January 2004.\n\n\n-----\n\nBarely visible satellite dishes from the street view of 85 Zhujiang Road outside the compound\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are still significant intelligence gaps that prevent Falcon Intelligence from making an assessment about STONE PANDA’s potential\nconnections to the MSS Tianjin Bureau with a high degree of confidence. However, additional information is likely to materialize either directly\nfrom IntrusionTruth or from other firms in the infosec community who are undoubtedly looking at this material as well and may have unique\ninsight of their own. Ultimately, IntrusionTruth’s prior releases on GOTHIC PANDA proved accurate and led to a U.S. Department of Justice\nindictment resulting in the dismantling of Boyusec. From their latest post, which contains GAO’s Uber receipts, it is clear the group’s\ninformation likely goes beyond merely available OSINT data.\n\nIt cannot be ignored that there are striking similarities between the entities associated with GOTHIC PANDA and the actors and firms\nmentioned in the blogs about STONE PANDA. In addition, FalconIntelligence notes that following the late 2015 Sino-U.S. brief cyber detente,\nmuch of the responsibility for western cyber intrusion operations was handed to the MSS as the PLA underwent an extensive reform that is still\ncurrently underway, and which is consolidating its military cyber forces under the Strategic Support Force.\n\nThough the detente saw an initial drop in Chinese intrusion activity, it has steadily been increasing over the past several years, with a majority\nof the intrusions into western firms being conducted by suspected contractors. These adversaries are tracked by CrowdStrike as GOTHIC\nPANDA, STONE PANDA, WICKED PANDA, JUDGMENT PANDA, and KRYPTONITE PANDA. Many of these adversaries have begun\ntargeting supply chain and upstream providers to establish a potential platform for future operations and enable the collection of larger sets of\ndata.\n\nWhile the APT1, PUTTER PANDA, and Operation CameraShy reports all exposed PLA units at a time when Chinese military hacking against\nwestern firms was rampant, the attention has now swung toward identifying MSS contractors. The exposure of STONE PANDA as an MSS\ncontractor would be another blow to China’s current cyber operations given STONE PANDA’s prolific targeting of a variety of sectors, and may\nprompt an additional U.S. investigation at a tenuous time for Sino-U.S. relations during an ongoing trade war. However, it is important to note\nthat such public revelations often force these actors to cease operations, improve their operational security (OPSEC), and then return stronger\nthan before. As such, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence assesses that although Boyusec may have shuttered, elements of GOTHIC PANDA are\nlikely to still be active. The same is likely to be true for STONE PANDA following a period of silence.\n\n[The activities of STONE PANDA impact entities in the Aerospace & Defense,](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors?filter=target_industries.value.raw%3A%27Aerospace%20%26%20Defense%27) [Government,](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors?filter=target_industries.value.raw%3A%27Government%27) [Healthcare,](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors?filter=target_industries.value.raw%3A%27Healthcare%27) [Technology,](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors?filter=target_industries.value.raw%3A%27Technology%27) Telecommunications\nServices of several nations.\n\n_For more information on how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors like STONE PANDA into your security strategy, please visit the_ _Falcon_\n_Intelligence product page._\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. http://kjbz.mca.gov[.]cn/article/mzbzhzcwj/201106/20110600157934.shtml\n2. http://bjgwql[.]com/a/hezuojiaoliu/2011/0422/288.htm\n3. http://alumni.ecnu.edu[.]cn/s/328/t/528/3b/02/info80642.htm\n4. http://down.51cto[.]com/424761/down/1/\n5. http://www.djbh[.]net/webdev/web/LevelTestOrgAction.do?p=nlbdLv3&id=402885cb35d11a540135d168e41e000c\n6. http://rjzyjsxy.zzia.edu[.]cn/picture/article/25/27/01/6c8b24a143f9959a85301d4527f0/801f81cf-8f30-4aa4-8428-7f9d4e778e76.doc\n7. http://www.yingjiesheng[.]com/job-001-607-536.html\n8. https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-behind-apt3/\n9. https://zhidao.baidu[.]com/question/1046720364336588899.html?\n\nfr=iks&word=%CC%EC%BD%F2%CA%D0%D6%E9%BD%AD%B5%C085%BA%C5%CA%C7%CA%B2%C3%B4%B5%A5%CE%BB%C2%\n10. https://zhidao.baidu[.]com/question/146035392.html?\n\nfr=iks&word=%CC%EC%BD%F2%CA%D0%D6%E9%BD%AD%B5%C085%BA%C5%CA%C7%CA%B2%C3%B4%B5%A5%CE%BB%C2%\n11. https://zhidao.baidu[.]com/question/223614321.html?\n\nfr=iks&word=%CC%EC%BD%F2%CA%D0%D6%E9%BD%AD%B5%C085%BA%C5%CA%C7%CA%B2%C3%B4%B5%A5%CE%BB%C2%\n\n\n-----",
