An interesting correlation with this event (though perhaps not directly related..) is the\nsudden uptick of Emotet email spam shortly after the Microsoft news hit. Emotet has the\nfunctionality to drop other strains of malware on machines that it compromises, and lately\nTrickbot has been one of the main ones dropped by Emotet. Perhaps these actors are flexing\nthat Microsoft’s attempts did nothing; or perhaps they fear this is only the beginning of botnet\ntake downs and are increasing their efforts before they are fully taken down.\n\nA recent [bleeping computer article mentions a new malicious document template that is](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/watch-out-for-emotet-malwares-new-windows-update-attachment/)\npretending to be a ‘Windows Update’. It uses this to try to trick people into essentially\n‘enabling macros’, which allows the successful execution of the Emotet malware.\n\nHowever, it is odd that this is the approach in helping people avoid infection. You should not\nbe getting to the point where you download a suspicious attachment, execute it, and see the\nfake Windows Update document asking you to Enable Editing/Enable Content. Although\nthere are many different iterations of Emotet, there does appear to be a set of characteristics\nthat all Emotet spam share to some degree. This article will be going over the most recent\nemail spam templates we’ve seen from Emotet so that you can identify the spam without\ndownloading and executing a malware file.\n\n## Emotet Spam Templates\n\nWe’ve broken down the latest Emotet spam campaign into pieces that anyone can\n[understand and identify. A few months back we wrote a similar article on how to spot Emotet;](https://spamauditor.org/2020/02/spam-analysis-markings-of-an-emotet-phishing-email/)\nthis article will have more relevant information on current Emotet trends. Although Emotet\nhas been shown to consistently change email templates, usually it is only enough to bypass\nspam filters and will still retain a familiar Emotet ‘feel’. Emotet spam will not always contain\nall the characteristics which we will describe below, but we can be sure at least a subset will\nbe present.\n\n### 1. Emotet’s Payload is either an Attachment or Link\n\n\n-----\n\n_The redacted sections are mostly going to be domain of the recipient, or a ‘spoofed’ sender._\n_Emotet loves to make you think the email is from somebody you know, or that knows you._\nFairly straightforward, the two ways the malware file will reach your computer will be via\nattachment or link. The .doc attachment is likely to be identified and blocked by common\nemail antivirus scanners. The password protected zip file is the actors’ method of evading\nthese antivirus scans. With regards to links, in the current campaign we are noticing that the\n‘real’ URL when you hover over the link is different than what the link represents. This ‘fake’\nlink method is commonly used by spammers to trick people into believing they are clicking a\nfamiliar link. Always check where the link goes, either by hovering over it or right clicking and\ncopying the link’s location to paste somewhere (but not into your browser!).\n\n### 2. Emotet may Pretend to be part of an Existing Thread\n\nEmotet spam may pretend to be part of an already existing conversation with you. You might\nrecognize the ‘—-Original Message—-‘ line of the email, as it is a common method for\nEmotet to add this section. Emotet may also just copy and paste a real email reply chain that\nyou might have had with someone in the past (third example in the above picture).\n\n\n-----\n\nEmotet also likes to create a fake ‘Reply’ or ‘Forward’ message by adding that to the\nbeginning of the Subject line. If you have more expertise with email headers, you’ll be able to\nsee why these are not genuine Reply or Forward email chains.\n\nThe Emotet malware has many capabilities, and one of them is data exfiltration. When\nEmotet compromises a computer, it has been seen to steal data such as your email address\nand name, your email contact list, and emails in your ‘Sent’ folder. With this data, these\nactors will eventually send spam (using a different compromised machine) with your name in\nthe ‘From’, delivering malware to people on your contact list. This leads to our next point…\n\n### 3. Emotet may send an Email where the From:Name appears to be Someone you know\n\nEmotet will sometimes ‘spoof’ the ‘From name’ (the name of the sender in the From line, not\nto be confused with the ‘domain’ or ’email address’ portion of the From line). Typically the\nname that is spoofed will be the name of someone whose machine was previously infected\nwith the Emotet malware. It is likely that you will recognize this name, or have engaged in\nemail communication with this person some time in the past. The first example of the above\npicture shows that sometimes the whole email address will be in the ‘From name’ (disguised\nas the address by putting brackets <> around it). Many mobile applications for email will only\nshow you the ‘From name’ portion, hiding the actual email address. This method can\n\n\n-----\n\npotentially trick people into thinking they have received an email from someone they know,\nwhen in reality the actual sender is a different email address. It is a big red flag if you see two\n<email1@address><email2@address> in the From line of your email.\n\n### 4. The latest Trend is that the Subject will contain the Recipient’s Domain\n\nThis particular trend will very likely change if it hasn’t already. We have seen a variety of\ndifferent subject patterns such as Coronavirus News or Fake Invoices. The latest wave of\nEmotet spam has the ‘To name’ portion copied into the Subject line.\n\n## Concluding Remarks\n\nA typical Emotet spam message will always have either an attachment or link. Afterwards, it\nwill have some combination of the characteristics described in this article. However, be\nwarned that there will be some cases with very little identifying characteristics, as seen\nbelow.\n\nRemain vigilant, and keep up to date with the latest Emotet trends in order to avoid getting\ncompromised!\n\n\n-----",
