    "plain_text": "# U.K. Hospitals Hit in Widespread Ransomware Attack\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/u-k-hospitals-hit-in-widespread-ransomware-attack/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/u-k-hospitals-hit-in-widespread-ransomware-attack/)**\n\nAt least 16 hospitals in the United Kingdom are being forced to divert emergency patients\ntoday after computer systems there were infected with ransomware, a type of malicious\nsoftware that encrypts a victim’s documents, images, music and other files unless the victim\npays for a key to unlock them.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how this ransomware strain is being disseminated and why it\nappears to have spread so quickly, but there are indications the malware may be spreading\nto vulnerable systems through a security hole in Windows that was recently patched by\n**Microsoft.**\n\nThe ransom note left behind on computers infected with the Wanna Decryptor ransomware strain.\n\nImage: BleepingComputer.\n\nIn [a statement, the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) said a number of NHS](https://www.digital.nhs.uk/article/1491/Statement-on-reported-NHS-cyber-attack)\norganizations had suffered ransomware attacks.\n\n“This attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and is affecting organizations from\nacross a range of sectors,” the NHS said. “At this stage we do not have any evidence that\npatient data has been accessed.”\n\nAccording to [Reuters, hospitals across England are diverting patients requiring emergency](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-hospitals-idUSKBN18820S)\ntreatment away from the affected hospitals, and the public is being advised to seek medical\ncare only for acute medical conditions.\n\n\n-----\n\nNHS said the investigation is at an early stage but the ransomware that hit at least 16 NHS\nfacilities is a variant of Wana Decryptor (a.k.a. “WannaCry“), a ransomware strain that\nsurfaced roughly two weeks ago.\n\n**[Lawrence Abrams, owner of the tech-help forum BleepingComputer, said Wana Decryptor](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/)**\nwasn’t a big player in the ransomware space until the past 24 hours, when something\ncaused it to be spread far and wide very quickly.\n\n“It’s been out for almost two weeks now, and until very recently it’s just been sitting there,”\nAbrams said. “Today, it just went nuts. This is by far the biggest outbreak we have seen to\ndate.”\n\nFor example, the same ransomware strain apparently today also hit Telefonica, one of\n[Spain’s largest telecommunications companies. According to an article on](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telefonica-tells-employees-to-shut-down-computers-amid-massive-ransomware-outbreak/)\nBleepingComputer, Telefonica has responded by “desperately telling employees to shut\ndown computers and VPN connections in order to limit the ransomware’s reach.”\n\n[An alert published by Spain’s national computer emergency response team (CCN-CERT)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telefonica-tells-employees-to-shut-down-computers-amid-massive-ransomware-outbreak/)\nsuggested that the reason for the rapid spread of Wana Decryptor is that it is leveraging a\nsoftware vulnerability in Windows computers that Microsoft patched in March.\n\nAccording to CCN-CERT, that flaw is [MS17-010, a vulnerability in the Windows Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx)\nMessage Block (SMB) service, which Windows computers rely upon to share files and\nprinters across a local network. Malware that exploits SMB flaws could be extremely\ndangerous inside of corporate networks because the file-sharing component may help the\nransomware spread rapidly from one infected machine to another.\n\nThat SMB flaw has enabled Wana Decryptor to spread to more than 36,000 Windows\ncomputers so far, according to Jakub Kroustek, a malware researcher with Avast, a\nsecurity firm based in the Czech Republic.\n\n[“So far, Russia, Ukraine, and Taiwan leading,” the world in new infections, Kroustek wrote in](https://twitter.com/JakubKroustek/status/863045197663490053)\na tweet. “This is huge.”\n\nAbrams said Wana Decryptor — like many ransomware strains — encrypts victim computer\nfiles with extremely strong encryption, but the malware itself is not hard to remove from\ninfected computers. Unfortunately, removing the infection does nothing to restore one’s files\nto their original, unencrypted state.\n\n“It’s not difficult to remove, but it also doesn’t seem to be decryptable,” Abrams said. “It also\nseems to be very persistent. Every time you make a new file [on an infected PC], it encrypts\nthat new file too.”\n\n\n-----\n\nExperts may yet find a weakness in Wana that allows them to way to decode the\nransomware strain without paying the ransom. For now, however, victims who don’t have\nbackups of their files have one option: Pay the $300 Bitcoin ransom being demanded by the\nprogram.\n\nWana Decryptor is one of hundreds of strains of ransomware. Victims who are struggling\n[with ransomware should pay a visit to BleepingComputer’s ransomware help forum, which](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/f/239/ransomware-help-tech-support/)\noften has tutorials on how to remove the malware and in some cases unlock encrypted files\n[without paying the ransom. In addition, the No More Ransom Project also includes an online](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\ntool that enables ransomware victims to learn if a free decryptor is available by uploading a\nsingle encrypted file.\n\n**Update, May 13, 9:33 a.m.: Microsoft today took the unusual step of releasing security**\nupdates to fix the SMB flaw in unsupported versions of Windows, including Windows XP,\n[Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003.
