The United States, together with our allies, will do everything in our power to identify\nthe perpetrators of ransomware attacks, to bring them to justice, and to recover the funds\nthey have stolen from their victims.”\n\n“Our message to ransomware criminals is clear: If you target victims here, we will target\nyou,” said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. “The Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware group\nattacks companies and critical infrastructures around the world, and today’s announcements\nshowed how we will fight back. In another success for the department’s recently launched\nRansomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, criminals now know we will take away your\nprofits, your ability to travel, and – ultimately – your freedom. Together with our partners at\nhome and abroad, the Department will continue to dismantle ransomware groups and disrupt\nthe cybercriminal ecosystem that allows ransomware to exist and to threaten all of us.”\n\n“The arrest of Yaroslav Vasinskyi, the charges against Yevgeniy Polyanin and seizure of $6.1\nmillion of his assets, and the arrests of two other Sodinokibi/REvil actors in Romania are the\nculmination of close collaboration with our international, U.S. government and especially our\nprivate sector partners,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The FBI has worked creatively\nand relentlessly to counter the criminal hackers behind Sodinokibi/REvil. Ransomware\ngroups like them pose a serious, unacceptable threat to our safety and our economic wellbeing. We will continue to broadly target their actors and facilitators, their infrastructure, and\ntheir money, wherever in the world those might be.”\n\n“Ransomware can cripple a business in a matter of minutes. These two defendants deployed\nsome of the internet’s most virulent code, authored by REvil, to hijack victim computers,” said\nActing U.S. Attorney Chad E. Meacham for the Northern District of Texas. “In a matter of\nmonths, the Justice Department identified the perpetrators, effected an arrest, and seized a\nsignificant sum of money. The Department will delve into the darkest corners of the internet\nand the furthest reaches of the globe to track down cyber criminals.”\n\nAccording to court documents, Vasinskyi was allegedly responsible for the July 2\nransomware attack against Kaseya. In the alleged attack against Kaseya, Vasinskyi caused\nthe deployment of malicious Sodinokibi/REvil code throughout a Kaseya product that caused\nthe Kaseya production functionality to deploy REvil ransomware to “endpoints” on Kaseya\ncustomer networks. After the remote access to Kaseya endpoints was established, the\nransomware was executed on those computers, which resulted in the encryption of data on\ncomputers of organizations around the world that used Kaseya software.\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough the deployment of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware, the defendants allegedly left\nelectronic notes in the form of a text file on the victims’ computers. The notes included a web\naddress leading to an open-source privacy network known as Tor, as well as the link to a\npublicly accessible website address the victims could visit to recover their files. Upon visiting\neither website, victims were given a ransom demand and provided a virtual currency address\nto use to pay the ransom. If a victim paid the ransom amount, the defendants provided the\ndecryption key, and the victims then were able to access their files. If a victim did not pay the\nransom, the defendants typically posted the victims’ stolen data or claimed they sold the\nstolen data to third parties, and victims were unable to access their files.\n\nVasinskyi and Polyanin are charged in separate indictments with conspiracy to commit fraud\nand related activity in connection with computers, substantive counts of damage to protected\ncomputers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted of all counts, each\nfaces a maximum penalty of 115 and 145 years in prison, respectively.\n\nThe $6.1 million seized from Polyanin is alleged to be traceable to ransomware attacks and\nmoney laundering committed by Polyanin through his use of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware.\nThe seizure warrant was issued out of the Northern District of Texas. Polyanin is believed to\nbe abroad.\n\nOn Oct. 8, Vasinskyi was taken into custody in Poland where he remains held by authorities\npending proceedings in connection with his requested extradition to the United States,\npursuant to the extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Poland. In\nparallel with the arrest, interviews and searches were carried out in multiple countries, and\nwould not have been possible without the rapid response of the National Police of Ukraine\nand the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine.\n\nThe FBI’s Dallas and Jackson Field Offices are leading the investigation. Substantial\nassistance was provided by the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs and the\nNational Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany H. Eggers of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of Texas and Senior Counsel Byron M. Jones from the Justice Department’s\nComputer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are prosecuting the case.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, the FBI’s Dallas and Jackson\nField Offices, and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nconducted the operation in close cooperation with Europol and Eurojust, who were an\nintegral part of coordination. Investigators and prosecutors from several jurisdictions,\nincluding: Romania's National Police and the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime\nand Terrorism; Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police; France’s Court of Paris and BL2C\n(anti-cybercrime unit police); Dutch National Police; Poland’s National Prosecutor’s Office,\nBorder Guard, Internal Security Agency, and Ministry of Justice; and the governments of\nNorway and Australia provided valuable assistance.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),\nDepartment of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n(CISA), Germany’s Public Prosecutor’s Office Stuttgart and State Office of Criminal\nInvestigation of Baden-Wuerttemberg; Switzerland’s Public Prosecutor’s Office II of the\nCanton of Zürich and Cantonal Police Zürich; United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency; U.S.\nSecret Service; Texas Department of Information Resources; BitDefender; McAfee; and\nMicrosoft also provided significant assistance.\n\nThis case is part of the Department of Justice’s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task\nForce, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion\nattacks. As part of the task force, the Criminal Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys’\nOffices, prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital\nextortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware,\nidentifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their\ncrimes. The department, through the task force, also strategically targets the ransomware\ncriminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government\nagencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.\n\nFor more information about the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task\nForce, read the [Deputy Attorney General’s recent guidance memo on related investigations](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1402001/download)\nand cases.
