These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat\n(APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or\ndestructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber\nactors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property\n[damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.](https://www.cisa.gov/national-critical-functions-set)\n\nOT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, often incorporate vulnerable information\ntechnology (IT) components, and include external connections and remote access that\nincrease their attack surfaces. In addition, a multitude of tools are readily available to exploit\nIT and OT systems. As a result of these factors, malicious cyber actors present an increasing\nrisk to ICS networks.\n\nTraditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats to\nthose systems. However, owners and operators who understand cyber actors’ tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) can use that knowledge when prioritizing hardening\nactions for OT/ICS.\n\nThis joint Cybersecurity Advisory, which builds on previous NSA and CISA guidance to stop\nmalicious ICS activity and [reduce OT exposure [1] [2], describes TTPs that malicious actors](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/23/2002462846/-1/-1/1/OT_ADVISORY-DUAL-OFFICIAL-20200722.PDF)\nuse to compromise OT/ICS assets. It also recommends mitigations that owners and\noperators can use to defend their systems. NSA and CISA encourage OT/ICS owners and\noperators to apply the recommendations in this CSA.\n\n[Download the PDF version of this report: pdf, 538.12 kb](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/22/2003083007/-1/-1/0/CSA_ICS_Know_the_Opponent_.PDF)\n\n## Technical Details\n\nOT/ICS assets operate, control, and monitor industrial processes throughout U.S. critical\ninfrastructure. Traditional ICS assets are difficult to secure due to their design for maximum\navailability and safety, coupled with their use of decades-old systems that often lack any\nrecent security updates. Newer ICS assets may be able to be configured more securely, but\n\n\n-----\n\noften have an increased attack surface due to incorporating Internet or IT network\nconnectivity to facilitate remote control and operations. The net effect of the convergence of\nIT and OT platforms has increased the risk of cyber exploitation of control systems. [3]\n\nToday’s cyber realm is filled with well-funded malicious cyber actors financed by nationstates, as well as less sophisticated groups, independent hackers, and insider threats.\nControl systems have been targeted by a variety of these malicious cyber actors in recent\nyears to achieve political gains, economic advantages, and possibly destructive effects. [4]\n\n[5] [6] [7] [8] More recently, APT actors have also developed tools for scanning,\ncompromising, and controlling targeted OT devices. [9]\n\n## Malicious actors’ game plan for control system intrusions\n\nCyber actors typically follow these steps to plan and execute compromises against critical\ninfrastructure control systems:\n\n1. Establish intended effect and select a target.\n2. Collect intelligence about the target system.\n3. Develop techniques and tools to navigate and manipulate the system.\n4. Gain initial access to the system.\n5. Execute techniques and tools to create the intended effect.\n\nLeveraging specific expertise and network knowledge, malicious actors such as nation-state\nactors can conduct these steps in a coordinated manner, sometimes concurrently and\nrepeatedly, as illustrated by real world cyber activity. [5] [10]\n\n## Establish intended effect and select a target\n\nCyber actors, from cyber criminals to state-sponsored APT actors, target critical\ninfrastructure to achieve a variety of objectives. Cyber criminals are financially motivated and\ntarget OT/ICS assets for financial gain (e.g., data extortion or ransomware operations).\nState-sponsored APT actors target critical infrastructure for political and/or military\nobjectives, such as destabilizing political or economic landscapes or causing psychological\nor social impacts on a population. The cyber actor selects the target and the intended effect\n—to disrupt, disable, deny, deceive, and/or destroy—based on these objectives. For\nexample, disabling power grids in strategic locations could destabilize economic landscapes\nor support broader military campaigns. Disrupting water treatment facilities or threatening to\ndestroy a dam could have psychological or social impacts on a population. [11] [12]\n\n## Collect intelligence about the target system\n\nOnce the intent and target are established, the actor collects intelligence on the targeted\ncontrol system. The actor may collect data from multiple sources, including:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Open-source research: A great deal of information about control systems and their**\ndesigns is publicly available. For example, solicitation information and employment\nadvertisements may indicate components and—list specific model numbers.\n**Insider threats: The actor may also leverage trusted insiders, even unwitting ones, for**\ncollecting information. Social engineering often elicits a wealth of information from\npeople looking for a new job or even just trying to help.\n**Enterprise networks: The actor may compromise enterprise IT networks and collect**\nand exfiltrate ICS-related information. Procurement documents, engineering\nspecifications, and even configurations may be stored on corporate IT networks.\n\nIn addition to OT-specific intelligence, information about IT technologies used in control\nsystems is widely available. Knowledge that was once limited to control system engineers\nand OT operators has become easily available as IT technologies move into more of the\ncontrol system environment. Control system vendors, in conjunction with the owner/operator\ncommunity, have continually optimized and reduced the cost of engineering, operating, and\nmaintaining control systems by incorporating more commodity IT components and\ntechnologies in some parts of OT environments. These advancements sometimes can make\ninformation about some systems easily available, thereby increasing the risk of cyber\nexploitation.\n\n## Develop techniques and tools\n\nUsing the intelligence collected about the control system’s design, a cyber actor may procure\nsystems that are similar to the target and configure them as mock-up versions for practice\npurposes. Nation-state actors can easily obtain most control system equipment. Groups with\nlimited means can still often acquire control systems through willing vendors and\nsecondhand resellers.\n\nAccess to a mock-up of the target system enables an actor to determine the most effective\ntools and techniques. A cyber actor can leverage resident system utilities, available\nexploitation tools; or, if necessary, develop or purchase custom tools to affect the control\nsystem. Utilities that are already on the system can be used to reconfigure settings and may\nhave powerful troubleshooting capabilities.\n\nAs the control system community has incorporated commodity IT and modernized OT, the\ncommunity has simplified the tools, techniques, scripts, and software packages used in\ncontrol systems. As a result, a multitude of convenient tools are readily available to exploit IT\nand OT systems.\n\nActors may also develop custom ICS-focused malware based on their knowledge of the\ncontrol systems. For example, TRITON malware was designed to target certain versions of\nTriconex Tricon programmable logic controllers (PLCs) by modifying in-memory firmware to\nadd additional programming. The extra functionality allows an actor to read/modify memory\n\n\n-----\n\ncontents and execute custom code, disabling the safety system. [13] APT actors have also\ndeveloped tools to scan for, compromise, and control certain Schneider Electric PLCs,\nOMRON Sysmac NEX PLCs, and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture\n(OPC UA) servers. [9]\n\nWith TTPs in place, a cyber actor is prepared to do virtually anything that a normal system\noperator can, and potentially much more.\n\n## Gain initial access to the system\n\nTo leverage the techniques and tools that they developed and practiced, cyber actors must\nfirst gain access to the targeted system.\n\nMost modern control systems maintain remote access capabilities allowing vendors,\nintegrators, service providers, owners, and operators access to the system. Remote access\nenables these parties to perform remote monitoring services, diagnose problems remotely,\nand verify warranty agreements.\n\nHowever, these access points often have poor security practices, such as using default and\nmaintenance passwords. Malicious cyber actors can leverage these access points as vectors\nto covertly gain access to the system, exfiltrate data, and launch other cyber activities before\nan operator realizes there is a problem. Malicious actors can use web-based search\nplatforms, such as Shodan, to identify these exposed access points.\n\nVendor access to control systems typically use connections that create a bridge between\ncontrol system networks and external environments. Often unknown to the owner/operator,\nthis bridge provides yet another path for cyber exploitation and allows cyber actors to take\nadvantage of vulnerabilities in other infrastructure to gain access to the control system.\n\nRemote access points and methodologies use a variety of access and communication\nprotocols. Many are nothing more than vendor-provided dial-up modems and network\nswitches protected only by obscurity and passwords. Some are dedicated devices and\nservices that communicate via more secure virtual private networks (VPNs) and encryption.\nFew, if any, offer robust cybersecurity capabilities to protect the control system access points\nor prevent the transmission of acquired data outside the relatively secure environment of the\nisolated control system. This access to an ostensibly closed control system can be used to\nexploit the network and components.\n\n## Execute techniques and tools to create the intended effects\n\nOnce an actor gains initial access to targeted OT/ICS system, the actor will execute\ntechniques, tools, and malware to achieve the intended effects on the target system. To\ndisrupt, disable, deny, deceive, and/or destroy the system, the malicious actor often\nperforms, in any order or in combination, the following activities:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Degrade the operator s ability to monitor the targeted system or degrade the operator s\n\nconfidence in the control system’s ability to operate, control, and monitor the targeted\nsystem. Functionally, an actor could prevent the operator's display (human machine\ninterface, or HMI) from being updated and selectively update or change visualizations\non the HMI, as witnessed during the attack on the Ukraine power grid. [5] (Manipulation\n[of View [T0832] )](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0832/)\n2. Operate the targeted control system. Functionally, this includes the ability to modify\n\nanalog and digital values internal to the system (changing alarms and adding or\nmodifying user accounts), or to change output control points — this includes abilities\nsuch as altering tap changer output signals, turbine speed demand, and opening and\n[closing breakers. (Manipulation of Control [T0831])](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0831)\n3. Impair the system's ability to report data. Functionally, this is accomplished by\n\ndegrading or disrupting communications with external communications circuits (e.g.,\nICCP, HDLC, PLC, VSAT, SCADA radio, other radio frequency mediums), remote\nterminal units (RTUs) or programmable logic controllers (PLCs), connected business or\ncorporate networks, HMI subnetworks, other remote I/O, and any connected\n[Historian/bulk data storage. (Block Reporting Message [T0804], Denial of View](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0804)\n\n[[T0815])](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0815/)\n4. Deny the operator's ability to control the targeted system. Functionally, this includes the\n\nability to stop, abort, or corrupt the system’s operating system (OS) or the supervisory\ncontrol and data acquisition (SCADA) system’s software functionality. (Denial of Control\n\n[[T0813])](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0813/)\n5. Enable remote or local reconnaissance on the control system. Functionally, an actor\n\ncould obtain system configuration information to enable development of a modified\n[system configuration or a custom tool. (Collection [TA0100], Theft of Operational](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0100)\n[Information [T0882])](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0882/)\n\nUsing these techniques, cyber actors could cause various physical consequences. They\ncould open or close breakers, throttle valves, overfill tanks, set turbines to over-speed, or\nplace plants in unsafe operating conditions. Additionally, cyber actors could manipulate the\ncontrol environment, obscuring operator awareness and obstructing recovery, by locking\ninterfaces and setting monitors to show normal conditions. Actors can even suspend alarm\nfunctionality, allowing the system to operate under unsafe conditions without alerting the\noperator. Even when physical safety systems should prevent catastrophic physical\nconsequences, more limited effects are possible and could be sufficient to meet the actor’s\nintent. In some scenarios though, if an actor simultaneously manipulates multiple parts of the\nsystem, the physical safety systems may not be enough. Impacts to the system could be\ntemporary or permanent, potentially even including physical destruction of equipment.\n\n## Mitigations\n\n\n-----\n\nThe complexity of balancing network security with performance, features, ease-of-use, and\navailability can be overwhelming for owner/operators. This is especially true where system\ntools and scripts enable ease-of-use and increase availability or functionality of the control\nnetwork; and when equipment vendors require remote access for warranty   compliance,\nservice obligations, and financial/billing functionality. However, with the increase in targeting\nof OT/ICS by malicious actors, owner/operators should be more cognizant of the risks when\nmaking these balancing decisions. Owner/operators should also carefully consider what\ninformation about their systems needs to be publicly available and determine if each external\nconnection is truly needed. [1]\n\nSystem owners and operators cannot prevent a malicious actor from targeting their systems.\nUnderstanding that being targeted is not an “if” but a “when” is essential context for making\nICS security decisions. By assuming that the system is being targeted and predicting the\neffects that a malicious actor would intend to cause, owner/operators can employ and\nprioritize mitigation actions.\n\nHowever, the variety of available security solutions can also be intimidating, resulting in\nchoice paralysis. In the midst of so many options, owner/operators may be unable to\nincorporate simple security and administrative strategies that could mitigate many of the\ncommon and realistic threats. Fortunately, owner/operators can apply a few straightforward\nICS security best practices to counter adversary TTPs.\n\n## Limit exposure of system information\n\nOperational and system information and configuration data is a key element of critical\ninfrastructure operations. The importance of keeping such data confidential cannot be\noverstated. To the extent possible, avoid disclosing information about system hardware,\nfirmware, and software in any public forum. Incorporate information protection education into\ntraining for personnel. Limit information that is sent out from the system.\n\nDocument the answers to the following questions:\n\n1. From where and to where is data flowing?\n2. How are the communication pathways documented and how is the data\n\nsecured/encrypted?\n3. How is the data used and secured when it arrives at its destination?\n4. What are the network security standards at the data destination, whether a\n\nvendor/regulator or administrator/financial institution?\n5. Can the data be shared further once at its destination? Who has the authority to share\n\nthis data?\n\nEliminate all other data destinations. Share only the data necessary to comply with\napplicable legal requirements, such as those contractually required by vendors—nothing\nmore Do not allow other uses of the data and other accesses to the system without strict\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrative policies designed specifically to protect the data. Prevent new connections to\nthe control system using strict administrative accountability. Ensure strict agreements are in\nplace with outside systems/vendors when it comes to sharing, access, and use. Have strong\npolicies for the destruction of such data. Audit policies and procedures to verify compliance\nand secure data once it gets to its destination, and determine who actually has access to it.\n\n## Identify and secure remote access points\n\nOwner/operators must maintain detailed knowledge of all installed systems, including which\nremote access points are—or could be—operating in the control system network. Creating a\nfull “connectivity inventory” is a critical step in securing access to the system.\n\nMany vendor-provided devices maintain these access capabilities as an auxiliary function\nand may have services that will automatically ‘phone home’ in an attempt to register and\nupdate software or firmware. A vendor may also have multiple access points to cover\ndifferent tasks.\n\nOnce owner/operators have identified all remote access points on their systems, they can\nimplement the following recommendations to improve their security posture:\n\nReduce the attack surface by proactively limiting and hardening Internet-exposed\nassets. See CISA’s [Get Your Stuff Off Search page for more information.](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/stuff-off-search)\nEstablish a firewall and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the control system and the\nvendor’s access points and devices. Do not allow direct access into the system; use an\nintermediary service to share only necessary data and only when required. For more\n[information see CISA’s infographic Layering Network Security Through Segmentation.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/layering-network-security-segmentation_infographic_508_0.pdf)\n\n[14]\nConsider using virtual private networks (VPNs) at specific points to and from the\nsystem rather than allowing separate access points for individual devices or vendors.\nUtilize jump boxes to isolate and monitor access to the system.\nEnsure that data can only flow outward from the system – administratively and\nphysically. Use encrypted links to exchange data outside of the system.\nEnforce strict compliance with policies and procedures for remote access, even if\npersonnel complain that it is too difficult.\nIf the system does not use vendor access points and devices, ensure that none are\nactive. Use strict hardware, software, and administrative techniques to prevent them\nfrom becoming covertly active.\nDo not allow vendor-provided system access devices and software to operate\ncontinuously in the system without full awareness of their security posture and access\nlogs.\nInstall and keep current all vendor-provided security systems associated with the\ninstalled vendor access points.\n\n\n-----\n\nReview configurations to ensure they are configured securely. Operators typically focus\non necessary functionality, so properly securing the configurations and remote access\nmay be overlooked.\nConsider penetration testing to validate the system’s security posture and any unknown\naccesses or access vulnerabilities.\nAdd additional security features to the system as needed. Do not assume that one\nvendor has a monopoly on the security of their equipment; other vendors may produce\nsecurity features to fill gaps.\nChange all default passwords throughout the system and update any products with\nhard-coded passwords, especially in all remote access and security components.\nPatch known exploited vulnerabilities whenever possible. Prioritize timely patching of\nall remote access points. Keep operating systems, firewalls, and all security features\nup-to-date.\nContinually monitor remote access logs for suspicious accesses. Securely aggregate\nlogs for easier monitoring.\n\n## Restrict tools and scripts\n\nLimit access to network and control system application tools and scripts to legitimate users\nperforming legitimate tasks on the control system. Removing the tools and scripts entirely\nand patching embedded control system components for exploitable vulnerabilities is often\nnot feasible. Thus, carefully apply access and use limitations to particularly vulnerable\nprocesses and components to limit the threat.\n\nThe control system and any accompanying vendor access points may have been delivered\nwith engineering, configuration, and diagnostic tools pre-installed. Engineers use these tools\nto configure and modify the system and its processes as needed. However, such tools can\nalso be used by a malicious actor to manipulate the system, without needing any special\nadditional tools. Using the system against itself is a powerful cyber exploitation technique.\nMitigations strategies include:\n\n1. Identify any engineering, configuration, or diagnostic tools.\n2. Securely store gold copies of these tools external to the system if possible.\n3. Remove all non-critical tools.\n4. Prevent these tools from being reinstalled.\n5. Perform routine audits to check that these tools have not been reinstalled.\n\n## Conduct regular security audits\n\nThe owner/operator of the control system should consider performing an independent\nsecurity audit of the system, especially of third-party vendor access points and systems. The\nowner/operator cannot solely depend on the views, options, and guidance of the\nvendor/integrator that designed, developed, or sold the system. The goal of such an audit is\n\n\n-----\n\nto identify and document system vulnerabilities, practices, and procedures that should be\neliminated to improve the cyber defensive posture, and ultimately prevent malicious cyber\nactors from being able to cause their intended effects. Steps to consider during an audit\ninclude the following:\n\n1. Validate all connections (e.g., network, serial, modem, wireless, etc.).\n2. Review system software patching procedures.\n3. Confirm secure storage of gold copies (e.g., OS, firmware, patches, configurations,\n\netc.).\n4. Verify removal from the system of all non-critical software, services, and tools.\n5. Audit the full asset inventory.\n6. Implement CISA ICS mitigations and best practices. [15] [16]\n7. Monitor system logs and intrusion detection system (IDS) logs.\n\n## Implement a dynamic network environment\n\nStatic network environments provide malicious actors with persistent knowledge of the\nsystem. A static network can provide cyber actors the opportunity to collect bits of\nintelligence about the system over time, establish long-term accesses into the system, and\ndevelop the tools and TTPs to affect the control system as intended.\n\nWhile it may be unrealistic for the administrators of many OT/ICS environments to make\nregular non-critical changes, owner/operators should consider periodically making\nmanageable network changes. A little change can go a long way to disrupt previously\nobtained access by a malicious actor. Consider the following:\n\n1. Deploy additional firewalls and routers from different vendors.\n2. Modify IP address pools.\n3. Replace outdated hardware (e.g., workstations, servers, printers, etc.).\n4. Upgrade operating systems.\n5. Install or upgrade commercially available security packages for vendor access points\n\nand methodologies.\n\nPlanning these changes with significant forethought can help minimize the impact on network\noperation.\n\nOwner/operators should familiarize themselves with the risks to the system as outlined by\nthe product vendor. These may be described in manuals as the system using insecure\nprotocols for interoperability or certain configurations that may expose the system in\nadditional ways. Changes to the system to reduce these risks should be considered and\nimplemented when feasible.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe combination of integrated, simplified tools and remote accesses creates an environment\nripe for malicious actors to target control systems networks. New IT-enabled accesses\nprovide cyber actors with a larger attack surface into cyber-physical environments. It is vital\nfor OT/ICS defenders to anticipate the TTPs of cyber actors combining IT expertise with\nengineering know-how. Defenders can employ the mitigations listed in this advisory to limit\nunauthorized access, lock down tools and data flows, and deny malicious actors from\nachieving their desired effects.\n\n## Disclaimer of endorsement\n\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without\nany warranties or guarantees.
