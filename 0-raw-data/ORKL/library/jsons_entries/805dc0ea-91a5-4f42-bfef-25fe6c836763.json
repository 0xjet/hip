Witt,\nwho defected to Iran in 2013, is alleged to have assisted Iranian intelligence services in\ntargeting her former fellow agents in the U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC). Witt is also\nalleged to have disclosed the code name and classified mission of a U.S. Department of\nDefense Special Access Program. An arrest warrant has been issued for Witt, who remains\nat large.\n\nThe same indictment charges four Iranian nationals, Mojtaba Masoumpour, Behzad Mesri,\nHossein Parvar and Mohamad Paryar (the “Cyber Conspirators”), with conspiracy, attempts\nto commit computer intrusion and aggravated identity theft, for conduct in 2014 and 2015\ntargeting former co-workers and colleagues of Witt in the U.S. Intelligence Community. The\n\n\n-----\n\nCyber Conspirators, using fictional and imposter social media accounts and working on\nbehalf of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), sought to deploy malware that\nwould provide them covert access to the targets’ computers and networks. Arrest warrants\nhave been issued for the Cyber Conspirators, who also remain at large.\n\nThe announcement was made by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John\nDemers, U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu for the District of Columbia, Executive Assistant Director\nfor National Security Jay Tabb of the FBI, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Special\nAgent Terry Phillips of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and Assistant Director in\nCharge Nancy McNamara of the FBI’s Washington Field Office.\n\n“Monica Witt is charged with revealing to the Iranian regime a highly classified intelligence\nprogram and the identity of a U.S. Intelligence Officer, all in violation of the law, her solemn\noath to protect and defend our country, and the bounds of human decency,” said Assistant\nAttorney General Demers. “Four Iranian cyber hackers are also charged with various\ncomputer crimes targeting members of the U.S. intelligence community who were Ms. Witt’s\nformer colleagues. This case underscores the dangers to our intelligence professionals and\nthe lengths our adversaries will go to identify them, expose them, target them, and, in a few\nrare cases, ultimately turn them against the nation they swore to protect. When our\nintelligence professionals are targeted or betrayed, the National Security Division will\nrelentlessly pursue justice against the wrong-doers.”\n\n“This case reflects our firm resolve to hold accountable any individual who betrays the public\ntrust by compromising our national security,” said U.S. Attorney Liu. “Today’s announcement\nalso highlights our commitment to vigorously pursue those who threaten U.S. security\nthrough state-sponsored hacking campaigns.”\n\n“The charges unsealed today are the result of years of investigative work by the FBI to\nuncover Monica Witt’s betrayal of the oath she swore to safeguard America’s intelligence and\ndefense secrets” said Executive Assistant Director for National Security Tabb. “This case\nalso highlights the FBI’s commitment to disrupting those who engage in malicious cyber\nactivity to undermine our country’s national security. The FBI is grateful to the Department of\nTreasury and the United States Air Force for their continued partnership and assistance in\nthis case.”\n\n[“Treasury is taking action against malicious Iranian cyber actors and covert operations that](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm611)\nhave targeted Americans at home and overseas as part of our ongoing efforts to counter the\nIranian regime’s cyber-attacks,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. “Treasury is\nsanctioning New Horizon Organization for its support to the IRGC-QF. New Horizon hosts\ninternational conferences that have provided Iranian intelligence officers a platform to recruit\nand collect damaging information from attendees, while propagating anti-Semitism and\nHolocaust denial. We are also sanctioning an Iran-based company that has attempted to\ninstall malware to compromise the computers of U.S. personnel.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe alleged actions of Monica Witt in assisting a hostile nation are a betrayal of our nation s\nsecurity, our military, and the American people,” said Special Agent Phillips. “While violations\nlike this are extremely rare, her actions as alleged are an affront to all who have served our\ngreat nation.”\n\n“This investigation exemplifies the tireless work the agents and analysts of the FBI do each\nand every day to bring a complex case like this to fruition,’ said Assistant Director in Charge\nMcNamara. “Witt's betrayal of her country and the actions of the cyber criminals - at the\nbehest of the IRGC - could have brought serious damage to the United States, and we will\nnot stand by and allow that to happen. The efforts by the Iranian government to target and\nharm the U.S. will not be taken lightly, and the FBI will continue our work to hold those\nindividuals or groups accountable for their actions.”\n\nAccording to the allegations contained in the indictment unsealed today:\n\nMonica Witt’s Espionage\n\nMonica Witt, a U.S. citizen, was an active duty U.S. Air Force Intelligence Specialist and\nSpecial Agent of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, who entered on duty in 1997\nand left the U.S. government in 2008. Monica Witt separated from the Air Force in 2008 and\nended work with DOD as a contractor in 2010. During her tenure with the U.S. government,\nWitt was granted high-level security clearances and was deployed overseas to conduct\nclassified counterintelligence missions.\n\nIn Feb. 2012, Witt traveled to Iran to attend the Iranian New Horizon Organization’s\n“Hollywoodism” conference, an IRGC-sponsored event aimed at, among other things,\ncondemning American moral standards and promoting anti-U.S. propaganda. Through\nsubsequent interactions and communications with a dual United States-Iranian citizen\nreferred to in the indictment as Individual A, Witt successfully arranged to re-enter Iran in\nAug. 2013. Thereafter, Iranian government officials provided Witt with a housing and\ncomputer equipment. She went on to disclose U.S. classified information to the Iranian\ngovernment official. As part of her work on behalf of the Iranian government, she conducted\nresearch about USIC personnel that she had known and worked with, and used that\ninformation to draft “target packages” against these U.S. agents.\n\nIranian Hacking Efforts Targeting Witt’s Former Colleagues\n\nBeginning in late 2014, the Cyber Conspirators began a malicious campaign targeting Witt’s\nformer co-workers and colleagues. Specifically, Mesri registered and helped manage an\nIranian company, the identity of which is known to the United States, which conducted\ncomputer intrusions against targets inside and outside the United States on behalf of the\nIRGC. Using computer and online infrastructure, in some cases procured by Mesri, the\nconspiracy tested its malware and gathered information from target computers or networks,\nand sent spearphishing messages to its targets. Specifically, between Jan. and May 2015,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Cyber Conspirators, using fictitious and imposter accounts, attempted to trick their\ntargets into clicking links or opening files that would allow the conspirators to deploy malware\non the target’s computer. In one such instance, the Cyber Conspirators created a Facebook\naccount that purported to belong to a USIC employee and former colleague of Witt, and\nwhich utilized legitimate information and photos from the USIC employee’s actual Facebook\naccount. This particular fake account caused several of Witt’s former colleagues to accept\n“friend” requests.\n\n***     *     ***\n\nThe case is being investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office with assistance from the\nAir Force Office of Special Investigations. The prosecution is being handled by Assistant\nU.S. Attorneys Deborah Curtis, Jocelyn Ballantine and Luke Jones of the U.S. Attorney’s\nOffice for the District of Columbia with assistance from Trial Attorney Evan N. Turgeon of the\nNational Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\n\n-----",
