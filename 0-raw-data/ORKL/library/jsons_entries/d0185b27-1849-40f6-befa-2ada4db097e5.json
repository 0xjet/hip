In this blog, we reveal two of FIN7’s new tools that we have called\nBOOSTWRITE and RDFSNIFFER.\n\nThe first of FIN7's new tools is BOOSTWRITE – an in-memory-only dropper that decrypts\nembedded payloads using an encryption key retrieved from a remote server at runtime. FIN7 has\nbeen observed making small changes to this malware family using multiple methods to avoid\ntraditional antivirus detection, including a BOOSTWRITE sample where the dropper was signed\nby a valid Certificate Authority. One of the analyzed BOOSTWRITE variants contained two\n[payloads: CARBANAK and RDFSNIFFER. While CARBANAK has been thoroughly analyzed and](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/carbanak-week-part-one-a-rare-occurrence.html)\nhas been used maliciously by several financial attackers including FIN7, RDFSNIFFER is a\nnewly-identified tool recovered by Mandiant investigators.\n\nRDFSNIFFER, a payload of BOOSTWRITE, appears to have been developed to tamper with\nNCR Corporation's “Aloha Command Center” client. NCR Aloha Command Center is a remote\nadministration toolset designed to manage and troubleshoot systems within payment card\nprocessing sectors running the Command Center Agent. The malware loads into the same\nprocess as the Command Center process by abusing the DLL load order of the legitimate Aloha\nutility. Mandiant provided this information to NCR.\n\n## BOOSTWRITE Loader: Where You At?\n\nBOOSTWRITE is a loader crafted to be launched via abuse of the DLL search order of\napplications which load the legitimate ‘Dwrite.dll’ provided by the Microsoft DirectX Typography\nServices. The application loads the ‘gdi’ library, which loads the ‘gdiplus’ library, which ultimately\nloads ‘Dwrite’. Mandiant identified instances where BOOSTWRITE was placed on the file system\nalongside the RDFClient binary to force the application to import DWriteCreateFactory from it\nrather than the legitimate DWrite.dll.\n\nOnce loaded, `DWrite.dll` connects to a hard-coded IP and port from which it retrieves a\ndecryption key and initialization vector (IV) to decrypt two embedded payload DLLs. To\naccomplish this task, the malware first generates a random file name to be used as a text log\nunder the current user's %TEMP% directory; this filename starts with ~rdf and is followed by a set\nof random numbers. Next, the malware scans its own image to find the location of a 32-byte long\nmulti-XOR key which is used to decode data inside its body. Part of the decoded data is an IP\naddress and port which are used to retrieve the key and the IV for the decryption of the\nembedded payloads. The encryption algorithm uses the ChaCha stream cipher with a 256-bit key\nand 64-bit IV.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the key and the IV are downloaded the malware decrypts the embedded payloads and\nperforms sanity checks on the results. The payloads are expected to be PE32.DLLs which, if the\ntests pass, are loaded into memory without touching the filesystem.\n\nThe malware logs various plaintext messages to the previously created logfile\n%TEMP%\\~rds<rnd_numbers> which are indicative of the loader’s execution progress. An\nexample of the file content is shown in Figure 1:\n\nLoading...\nStarting...\nInit OK\nKey OK\nData: 4606941\nHS: 20\nK:[32] V:[8]\nDCnt: 732642317(ERR)\n\nFigure 1: BOOSTWRITE log file\n\nBefore exiting, the malware resolves the location of the benign DWrite.dll library and passes the\nexecution control to its DWriteCreateFactory method.\n\nThe malware decrypts and loads two payload DLLs. One of the DLLs is an instance of the\nCARBANAK backdoor; the other DLL is a tool tracked by FireEye as RDFSNIFFER which allows\nan attacker to hijack instances of the NCR Aloha Command Center Client application and interact\nwith victim systems via existing legitimate 2FA sessions.\n\n## RDFSNIFFER Module: We Smell a RAT\n\nRDFSNIFFER is a module loaded by BOOSTWRITE which allows an attacker to monitor and\ntamper with legitimate connections made via NCR Corporation’s ‘Aloha Command Center Client’\n(RDFClient), an application designed to provide visibility and system management capabilities to\nremote IT techs. RDFSNIFFER loads into the same process as the legitimate RDFClient by\nabusing the utility’s DLL load order, launching each time the ‘Aloha Command Center Client’ is\nexecuted on an impacted system.\n\nWhen the RDFSNIFFER module is loaded by BOOSTWRITE it hooks several Win32 API\nfunctions intended to enable it to tamper with NCR Aloha Command Center Client sessions or\nhijack elements of its user-interface (Table 1). Furthermore, this enables the malware to alter the\nuser’s last input time to ensure application sessions do not time out.\n\n**Win32 API Function** **Hook Description**\n\nCertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy Used to man-in-the-middle SSL sessions\n\nCertGetCertificateChain Used to man-in-the-middle SSL sessions\n\nWSAConnect Used to man-in-the-middle socket connections\n\n|Win32 API Function|Hook Description|\n|---|---|\n|CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy|Used to man-in-the-middle SSL sessions|\n|CertGetCertificateChain|Used to man-in-the-middle SSL sessions|\n\n\n-----\n\nconnect Used to man-in-the-middle socket connections\n\nConnectEx Used to man-in-the-middle socket connections\n\nDispatchMessageW Used to hijack the utility's UI\n\nDispatchMessageA Used to hijack the utility's UI\n\nDefWindowProcW Used to hijack the utility's UI\n\nDefWindowProcA Used to hijack the utility's UI\n\nGetLastInputInfo Used to change the user's last input time (to avoid timed lock outs)\n\nTable 1: RDFSNIFFER’s Hooked Win32 API Functions\n\nThis module also contains a backdoor component that enables it to inject commands into an\nactive RDFClient session. This backdoor allows an attacker to upload, download, execute and/or\ndelete arbitrary files (Table 2).\n\n**Command** **Legit Function in** **RDFClient Com‐** **Description**\n**Name** **RDFClient** **mand ID**\n\nUpload FileMgrSendFile 107 Uploads a file to the remote system\n\nDownload FileMgrGetFile 108 Retrieves a file from the remote\nsystem\n\nExecute RunCommand 3001 Executes a command on the remote\nsystem\n\nDeleteRemote FileMgrDeleteFile 3019 Deletes file on remote system\n\nDeleteLocal - - Deletes a local file\n\nTable 2: RDFSNIFFER’s Backdoor Functions\n\n## Signed: Yours Truly, FIN7\n\nWhile the majority of BOOSTWRITE variants recovered from investigations have been unsigned,\nMandiant identified a signed BOOSTWRITE sample used by FIN7 during a recent investigation.\nFollowing that discovery, a signed BOOSTWRITE sample was uploaded to VirusTotal on October\n3. This executable uses a code signing certificate issued by MANGO ENTERPRISE LIMITED\n(Table 3).\n\n|ConnectEx|Used to man-in-the-middle socket connections|\n|---|---|\n|DispatchMessageW|Used to hijack the utility's UI|\n|DispatchMessageA|Used to hijack the utility's UI|\n|DefWindowProcW|Used to hijack the utility's UI|\n|DefWindowProcA|Used to hijack the utility's UI|\n|GetLastInputInfo|Used to change the user's last input time (to avoid timed lock outs)|\n\n|Command Name|Legit Function in RDFClient|RDFClient Com‐ mand ID|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Upload|FileMgrSendFile|107|Uploads a file to the remote system|\n|Download|FileMgrGetFile|108|Retrieves a file from the remote system|\n|Execute|RunCommand|3001|Executes a command on the remote system|\n|DeleteRemote|FileMgrDeleteFile|3019|Deletes file on remote system|\n|DeleteLocal|-|-|Deletes a local file|\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** **Organization** **Co**\n**un‐**\n**try**\n\na67d6e87283c34459b4660f19747a306 mango ENTER‐ GB\nPRISE LIMITED\n\nTable 3: Code signing certificate used for BOOSTWRITE\n\n\n**Serial**\n\n|a67d6e87283c34459b4660f19747a306|mango ENTER‐ PRISE LIMITED|GB|32 7F 8F 10 74 78 42 4A BE B8 2A 85 DC 36 57 03 CC 82 70 5B|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nThis indicates the operators may be actively altering this malware to avoid traditional detection\nmechanisms. Notably, the signed BOOSTWRITE sample had a 0/68 detection ratio when it was\nuploaded to VirusTotal, demonstrating the effectiveness of this tactic (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: Current VirusTotal detection ratio for signed BOOSTWRITE\n\nUse of a code signing certificate for BOOSTWRITE is not a completely new technique for FIN7 as\nthe group has used digital certificates in the past to sign their phishing documents, backdoors,\nand later stage tools. By exploiting the trust inherently provided by code certificates, FIN7\nincreases their chances of bypassing various security controls and successfully compromising\nvictims. The full evasion achieved against the detection engines deployed to VirusTotal – as\ncompared to an unsigned BOOSTWRITE sample with an invalid checksum– illustrates that\nFIN7’s methods were effective in subverting both traditional detection and ML binary classification\nengines. This is a known issue and has been deeply studied since at least 2016’s “Chains of\n[Distrust” research and 2017’s “Certified Malware” paper. Since there are plenty of goodware](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/papers/CCS-2017.pdf)\nsamples with bad or no signatures – and a growing number of malware samples with good\nsignatures – there is no easy solution here. The upside is that vendors selectively deploy engines\nto VirusTotal (including FireEye) and VT detection performance often isn’t a comprehensive\nrepresentation of encountering full security technology stacks that implement detection-in-depth.\nLater in this blog we further explore BOOSTWRITE’s PE Authenticode signature, its anomalies,\nand how code signing can be turned from a detection challenge into detection opportunities.\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nWhile these incidents have also included FIN7’s typical and long-used toolsets, such as\nCARBANAK and BABYMETAL, the introduction of new tools and techniques provides further\nevidence FIN7 is continuing to evolve in response to security enhancements. Further, the use of\n\n\n-----\n\nlimiting their use of these certificates to cases where they have been attempting to bypass\nparticular security controls. Barring any further law enforcement actions, we expect at least a\nportion of the actors who comprise the FIN7 criminal organization to continue conducting\ncampaigns. As a result, organizations need to remain vigilant and continue to monitor for changes\nin methods employed by the FIN7 actors.\n\n## Sigs Up Dudes! Indicators, Toolmarks, and Detection Opportunities\n\nWhile FireEye does not release our production detection logic for the code families, this section\ndoes contain some identification and hunting concepts that we adopt in our layered detection\nstrategy. Table 4 contains malware samples referenced in this blog that FireEye is able to share\nfrom the larger set recovered during active investigations.\n\n**Type** **Indicator(s)**\n\nBOOSTWRITE (signed) MD5: a67d6e87283c34459b4660f19747a306\nSHA-1: a873f3417d54220e978d0ca9ceb63cf13ec71f84\nSHA-256:\n18cc54e2fbdad5a317b6aeb2e7db3973cc5ffb01bbf810869d79e9cb3bf02bd5\n\nC2: 109.230.199[.]227\n\n\nBOOSTWRITE\n(unsigned)\n\n\nMD5: af2f4142463f42548b8650a3adf5ceb2\nSHA1: 09f3c9ae382fbd29fb47ecdfeb3bb149d7e961a1\nSHA256:\n8773aeb53d9034dc8de339651e61d8d6ae0a895c4c89b670d501db8dc60cd2d0\n\nC2: 109.230.199[.]227\n\n\nTable 4: Publicly-shareable BOOSTWRITE samples\n\nThe signed BOOSTWRITE sample has a PE Authenticode anomaly that can be detected using\n[yara’s PE signature module. Specifically, the PE linker timestamp is prior to the Authenticode](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pe.html#c.signatures)\nvalidity period, as seen in Table 5.\n\n**Timestamp** **Description**\n\n\n2019-05-20 09:50:55\nUTC\n\n2019-05-22 00:00 UTC\nthrough\n2020-05-21 23:59 UTC\n\n\nSigned BOOSTWRITE’s PE compilation time\n\nSigned BOOSTWRITE’s “mango ENTERPRISE LIMITED” certificate validity\nwindow\n\n\nTable 5: Relevant executabe timestamps\n\nA public example of a Yara rule covering this particular PE Authenticode timestamp anomaly is\navailable in a blog post from David Cannings, with the key logic shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\npe.number_of_signatures > 0 and not for all i in (0..pe.number_of_signatures - 1):\npe.signatures[i].valid_on(pe.timestamp)\n\nFigure 3: Excerpt of NCC Group’s research Yara rule\n\nThere are other PE Authenticode anomalies that can also be represented as Yara rules to surface\nsimilarly suspicious files. Of note, this signed BOOSTWRITE sample has no counter signature\nand, while the unauthenticated attributes timestamp structure is present, it is empty. In preparing\nthis blog, FireEye’s Advanced Practices team identified a possible issue with VirusTotal’s parsing\nof signed executable timestamps as seen in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Inconsistency in VirusTotal file signature timestamps for the signed BOOSTWRITE\nsample\n\nFireEye filed a bug report with Google to address the discrepancy in VirusTotal in order to remove\nconfusion for other users.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo account for the detection weaknesses introduced by techniques like code signing, our\nAdvanced Practices team combines the malicious confidence spectrum that comes from ML\ndetection systems with file oddities and anomalies (weak signals) to surface highly interesting and\nevasive malware. This technique was recently described in our own Dr. Steven Miller’s Definitive\nDossier of Devilish Debug Details. In fact, the exact same program database (PDB) path-based\napproach from his blog can be applied to the toolmarks seen in this sample for a quick hunting\nrule. Figure 5 provides the PDB path of the BOOSTWRITE samples from this blog.\n\nF:\\projects\\DWriteImpl\\Release\\DWriteImpl.pdb\n\nFigure 5: BOOSTWRITE PDB path\n\nThe Yara rule template can be applied to result in the quick rule in Figure 6.\n\nrule ConventionEngine_BOOSTWRITE\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Nick Carr (@itsreallynick)\"\nreference = \"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/definitive-dossier-of-devilish-debugdetails-part-one-pdb-paths-malware.html\"\nstrings:\n$weetPDB = /RSDS[\\x00-\\xFF]{20}[a-zA-Z]?:?\\\\[\\\\\\s|*\\s]?.{0,250}\\\\DWriteImpl[\\\\\\s|*\\s]?.{0,250}\\.pdb\\x00/\nnocase\ncondition:\n(uint16(0) == 0x5A4D) and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 and $weetPDB and filesize < 6MB\n}\n\nFigure 6: Applying BOOSTWRITE’s PDB path to a Yara rule\n\nWe can apply this same concept across other executable traits, such as BOOSTWRITE’s export\nDLL name (DWriteImpl.dll), to create quick and easy rules that can aid in quick discovery as seen\nin Figure 7.\n\nrule Exports_BOOSTWRITE\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Steve Miller (@stvemillertime) & Nick Carr (@itsreallynick)\"\nstrings:\n$exyPants = \"DWriteImpl.dll\" nocase\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 and $exyPants at pe.rva_to_offset(uin‐\nt32(pe.rva_to_offset(pe.data_directories[pe.IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT].virtual_address) +\n12)) and filesize < 6MB\n}\n\nFigure 7: Applying BOOSTWRITE’s export DLL names to a Yara rule (Note: this rule was updated\nfollowing publication.
