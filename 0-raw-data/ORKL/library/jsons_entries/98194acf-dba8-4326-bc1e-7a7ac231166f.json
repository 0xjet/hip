We\nhave been able to decode the raw traffic in command and control, find sophisticated lure\ndocuments used in the campaign, connect other previously unknown samples, and associate\na number of legitimate organizations whose infrastructure is referenced and used in the\ncampaign.\n\nThe campaign targets Middle Eastern organizations largely from the Lebanon and United\nArab Emirates, though, Indian and Canadian companies with interests in those Middle\nEastern countries are also targeted. There are new TTPs used in this attack – for example\nAgent_Drable is leveraging the Django python framework for command and control\ninfrastructure, the technical details of which are outlined later in the blog.\n\nWe are not sure which threat actor or proxy of a threat actor is behind the campaign. This\ncampaign is using previously undiscovered toolcraft and we speculate that right-to-left\nlanguages used has influenced the hardcoded string “Agent_Drable” name into the implant\n\n\n-----\n\nused in the campaign. It references a 2007 conflict of the Lebanese army at the Nahr\nElbard” Palestinian Refugee camp, which is a transliteration of Nahr el bared. The English\ntranslation of Nahr Elbard is “Cold River.”\n\nIn short, “Cold River” is a sophisticated threat that utilizes DNS subdomain hijacking,\ncertificate spoofing, and covert tunneled command and control traffic in combination with\ncomplex and convincing lure documents and custom implants.\n\n**_[Note: the campaign described in this blog post has been also covered by Talos and](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjnjP7b9-3fAhWVtXEKHZDfBGEQFjAAegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.talosintelligence.com%2F2018%2F11%2Fdnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html&usg=AOvVaw2GjQrr4nr6dAWET006zhBF)_** _CERT-_\n_OPMD, whereas the underpinning DNS hijacking attacks have been recently described in_\n_[detail by FireEye in this article.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale.html)_\n\n## MalDoc Droppers\n\nTwo malicious word documents were found, differing only in the decoy content (same VBA\nmacro, same payload). The first sample is an empty document but is weaponized (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of the weaponized empty document, sha1:\n\n1f007ab17b62cca88a5681f02089ab33adc10eec\n\nThe second one is a legitimate HR document from the SUNCOR company to which they\nadded the malicious payload and VBA macro (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of the HR document from Suncor, sha1:\n\n9ea865e000e3e15cec15efc466801bb181ba40a1\n\nWhile gathering open intelligence about the callback domain `0ffice36o[.]com we found a`\nreference to a potential linked document from Twitter (see Figure 3); although that document\ndid not contain the same payload. The person behind this Twitter account may have attached\nthe wrong document.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Tweet referencing a third document:\n[https://twitter.com/KorbenD_Intel/status/1053037793012781061](https://twitter.com/KorbenD_Intel/status/1053037793012781061)\n\nThe timestamps listed in Table 1 tend to confirm the hypothesis that the Suncor document is\na legitimate document which was weaponized: the creation date is old enough, and the last\nsave matches the timeframe of the campaign. The empty document is most likely the one\nused to test the macro or to deliver the payload in an environment not related to Suncor.\n\n\n**SHA1** **Description** **Creation**\n**Time**\n\n`1f007ab17b62cca88a5681f02089ab33adc10eec` Empty doc 2018-1005\n07:10:00\n\n\n**Last**\n**Saved**\n**Time**\n\n2018-1015\n02:59:00\n\n\n-----\n\n`9ea865e000e3e15cec15efc466801bb181ba40a1` Suncor\ndecoy\n\nTable 1: Malicious documents and related metadata.\n\n\n2012-0607\n18:25:00\n\n\n2018-1015\n22:22:00\n\n\nFor a more global timeline of the document and their payload, please refer to Figure 4.\n\n**Behavior Analysis**\n\nRegarding the VBA macro, it stays basic but efficient. The macro is split into two\ncomponents, one executing when the document is opened and the other at document close.\nThe actual payload is not stored directly into the VBA code, but instead hidden in a form\nwithin the document.\n\nWhen opening the Suncor document, macro execution must be enabled by the user to\nactually see its content. This makes the macro activation part appear legitimate to an\naverage user. The only additional obfuscation taking place is the use of string concatenation,\nsuch as “ t ” & “ mp “, “ Microsoft.XML ” & “ DOM “, “ userp ” & “ rofile “, etc.\n\nThe malicious macro contains some basic anti-sandboxing code, checking to see if a mouse\nis available on the computer using the API `Application.MouseAvailable . Overall, the`\nlogic of the macro is the following:\n\nAt document opening:\n\nCheck if `Environ(\"userprofile\")\\.oracleServices\\svshost_serv.exe exists.`\nIf yes, stop. If no, continue.\nCreate the directory `Environ(\"userprofile\")\\.oracleServices if it does not exist.`\nFetch the base64 encoded payload stored in `UserForm1.Label1.Caption .`\nDecode and write it into\n```\n   Environ(\"userprofile\")\\.oracleServices\\svshost_serv.doc .\n\n```\nReveal the document content.\n\nAt document close:\n\nRename the dropped “ svshost_serv.doc ” file as “ svshost_serv.exe ”.\nCreate a scheduled task that runs the EXE file every minute, named “ chrome\n```\n   updater ”.\n\n```\nA last interesting thing to note is that the part of the code setting up the scheduled task is\ncopied from an online resource .1\n\n## Payloads and CnC Communication\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found two related payloads, shown in Table 2. The main difference between the two\npayloads is that one of them has some event logging capabilities, making it easier to\ndetermine the actual intention of the implant; most likely it was an early development or\ndebug version. The sample actually packaged inside the Suncor documents was stripped of\nthis functionality.\n\n**SHA1** **Description** **Compilation**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n`1c1fbda6ffc4d19be63a630bd2483f3d2f7aa1f5` Payload with logs\ninformation\n\n`1022620da25db2497dc237adedb53755e6b859e3` Payload without\nlogs information\n\nTable 2: the Agent_Drable payloads.\n\n\n2018-09-03\n16:57:26 UTC\n\n2018-09-15\n02:31:15 UTC\n\n\nOne interesting string found inside the binary is “ AgentDrable.exe “. This name is written\nin the DLL Name entry of the Export directory inside the PE header. It will reappear in\ndifferent parts of this campaign, such as the infrastructure configuration. We can assume\nwith confidence that this is the name given to this implant by the threat actor. There is very\nlittle evidence referencing AgentDrable outside of recent submissions to a few analysis\nportals. One hypothesis is that it would be the name “Elbard” reversed.\n\nCompilation timestamps of the two samples are interesting as well. One has to be fully aware\nthat timestamps can easily be falsified, however, these can be found in multiple places\nacross the binaries (Debug directory, File header) and are coherent with the other events of\nthe campaign. We placed all the dropper and payloads timestamps in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Note that the creation timestamp of WORD_1 is omitted, being way further back in time\n\n(2012).\n\n\n-----\n\nOne interesting fact is the compilation timestamp of the dropped sample without logs, which\nmatches the last save time of the two word documents in which the dropped file was\nembedded. Meaning that they likely compiled the last version of their implant and directly\nweaponized the document for delivery.\n\nBoth malicious documents were submitted to VirusTotal from Lebanon just a few days\nlater. Overall this timeline provides a coherent story and suggests that none of the\ntimestamps were altered by the attackers. This completes the overview of the campaign\ndeployment; we will provide additional insight as we compare this with the evolution of the\nattackers command and control infrastructure.\n\n**Dropped Executable – Behavior Analysis**\n\nThe primary function of the dropped payload is to operate as a reconnaissance tool. There\nare no advanced functionalities implemented inside the binary (no screen capture or\nkeylogger, for example). This file’s main functions are:\n\nRunning commands from CnC and returning the output\nFile download and execution\nFile exfiltration\n\nOne IP and one domain name are hardcoded inside the binary, as well as a user agent:\n```\n   0ffice36o[.]com (clearly mimicking the legitimate office360[.]com )\n   185.161.211[.]72\n\n```\n`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0;` rv :11.0) like Gecko\n\nThe implant has two main ways of communicating with a CnC: (1) DNS requests, and (2)\nHTTP(S) GET/POST. The first execution defaults to DNS communication then, based on the\ncommands received, it may switch to HTTP.\n\nThe binary is executed every minute thanks to a scheduled task created by the malicious\ndocument. At the beginning of every run, it creates the following subdirectories if they do not\nexist:\n```\n   .\\Apps\n   .\\Uploads\n   .\\Downloads\n\n```\nDirectories “ Uploads ” and “ Downloads ” act exactly according to their name. Any\nexecutable located in the “ Apps ” directory will run each time the dropper implant is\nexecuted.\n\nAll the configuration data is handled using JSON and the cJSON library. Key names are\ngeneric, using one or two letters (‘a’, ‘m’, ‘ul’, …) but we managed to get a comprehensive\nlisting as shown in Table 3 The configuration is stored in the file “ Configure txt ” and\n\n\n-----\n\nretrieved at the beginning of every execution.\n\n\n**Parameter**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Comment**\n\n```\n a Execution mode (DNS/HTTP)\n m Max query length, used to split long DNS queries into\n        multiple shorter ones\n f Phase\n c DNS counter\n h Home path, where the subdirectories and config file are\n        created\n u HTTP CnC resource path\n s HTTP CnC IP address\n d DNS CnC domain\n p HTTP CnC port number\n l Connection type, HTTP or HTTPS\n i Victim ID (2 chars)\n k Custom base64 alphabet\n\n```\nTable 3: JSON configuration parameters (list not exhaustive).\n\nIn order to communicate with the DNS CnC, the sample performs DNS queries of specially\ncrafted subdomains. For example, here are some DNS queries from different victims:\n```\n   crzugfdhsmrqgq4hy000.0ffice36o[.]com\n   gyc3gfmhomrqgq4hy.0ffice36o[.]com\n   svg4gf2ugmrqgq4hy.0ffice36o[.]com\n   Hnahgfmg4mrqgq4hy.0ffice36o[.]com\n   6ghzGF2UGMD4JI2VOR2TGVKEUTKF.0ffice36o[.]com\n\n```\nThe subdomains follow a specific schema: they are made of 4 random alphadecimal chars\nand a base32 encoded payload. When applied to the domains listed above we get:\n\n**Subdomain** **Plain text**\n```\n crzugfdhsmrqgq4hy000 1Fy2048|\n gyc3gfmhomrqgq4hy 1Xw2048|\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n svg4gf2ugmrqgq4hy 1uC2048|\n 6ghzGF2UGMD4JI2VOR2TGVKEUTKF 1uC0|J5WGS5TJME\n\n```\nThese three first plain texts differ only by two letters: Fy / Xw / uC. It is an ID generated by\nthe sample, that allows the CnC to identify the source of a request. It is generated from the\nusername and/or hostname, and thus stays consistent between implant executions. The\nsame ID is used during HTTP communications.\n\nWhile in DNS mode, the implant communicates with the CnC exclusively through these\ncrafted subdomains and gets its command by interpreting the IP addresses returned. The\nHTTP communication mode is a bit more advanced: requests and answers from the implant\nrespectively use GET and POST methods. By default, the sample builds the URL\nhttp ://[CNC_IP]/[RESOURCE_PATH]?id=[ID] where:\n\n**Parameter** **Default Value** **Note**\n\n`CNC_IP` `185.161.211[.]72` This IP can be updated\n\n`RESOURCE_PATH` `/index.html` This path can be updated\n\n`ID` `Fy` This ID is constant for a given infection\n\nThe hardcoded CnC IP stored in the binaries was offline at the time of the analysis. We were\nable to find another active CnC hosted at `185.20.184[.]138 . Figure 5 shows what the`\npage looks like when accessed through a web browser.\n\nFigure 5: The fake Wikipedia page.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CnC commands are hidden inside HTML comments or within specific tags and encoded\nusing a custom base64 alphabet. Below is an excerpt of the source code of the page,\nshowing the encoded data.\n\nOnce decoded, they give the following JSON object from which the commands are extracted:\n\nThese commands show the typical steps that an attacker would take to perform host\nreconnaissance before proceeding with the intrusion. The full list of tags containing\ninstructions or commands is in Table 4.\n\n**Tag** **Description**\n\n`<!--[DATA]-->` Base64 encoded JSON content\n\n`<link href=\"[DATA]\">` Resource path from which a download must occur\n\n`<form action=\"[DATA]\"` Resource path on which the POST answers should be\nperformed\n```\n <style>/*\n [DATA]*/</style>\n <script>/*\n [DATA]*/</script>\n\n```\nTable 4: List of the tags that are extracted from the page.\n\nThe HTTP CnC is powered by a Django framework with debug mode activated. Thanks to\nthat misconfiguration, it is possible to gather some additional pieces of information that can\nbe used to map their whole infrastructure. Table 5 lists all the endpoints available.\n\n**Path** **Description**\n\n`/index.html (GET)` Retrieves commands and generic conf\nparams\n\n\n-----\n\n`/Client/Login (GET)` Retrieves the custom b64 alphabet used to\nencode data\n\n`/Client/Upload (POST)` Upload exfiltrated data or command results\n\n```\n/Client/Download/<str:url>\n\n```\n```\n/DnsClient/Register\n\n```\n```\n/DnsClient/GetCommand\n\n```\n```\n/DnsClient/SendResult\n\n```\n```\n/DnsClient/SendNotification\n\n```\n```\n/static/\n\n```\n```\n ^\\.well\\-known\\/acme\\-challenge\\/(?\n P<path>.*)$\n\n```\nTable 5: List of all available endpoints.\n\n\nUsed to generate let’s encrypt certificates\n\n\nBesides all the resource paths, the debug mode leaked all of the environment variables and\nsome Django internal settings. The most interesting values are listed in Tables 6 and 7 (the\nfull list is available upon request):\n\n**Var Name** **Value** **Comment**\n\n`PWD` `/root/relayHttps` Interesting directory name\n\n`PATH_INFO` `/static/backup.zip` Password protected backup of the\ndatabase\n```\n SERVER_NAME debian\n SERVER_SOFTWARE WSGIServer/0.2\n SHELL /usr/bin/zsh\n\n```\n`SSH_CLIENT` `194.9.177[.]22 53190` Leaked IP of their VPN server\n```\n            22\n\n```\nTable 6: Environment variables leaked due to a misconfigured Django instance.\n\n**Var Name** **Value** **Comment**\n```\n LOGIN_URL /accounts/login/\n\n```\n`MAGIC_WORD` `microsoft` Unknown\n```\n PANEL_PATH /Th!sIsP@NeL\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n PANEL_PORT :7070\n PANEL_USER_NAME admin\n DATABASES /root/relayHttps/ db .sqlite3\n SERVER_PORT :8083\n\n```\n`SERVER_URL` `https://185.20.184[.]157` Leaked IP, unknown usage\n\nTable 7: Settings leaked due to a misconfigured Django instance.\n\nOnce again we can find a mention to the “drable” monicker, this time as part of one of the\nqueries used to fetch data from the underlying database:\n\n```\nWHERE \"Client_drable\".\"relay_id\" = %s\n\n```\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThanks to the data leaked by the CnC and additional passive DNS data, we were able to\nidentify with high confidence, multiple hosts which belong to the campaign infrastructure.\nOne interesting fact is they are all part of the same autonomous system, Serverius N (AS\n50673), and hosted by Deltahost. Furthermore, all the domain names were registered\nthrough NameSilo.\n\n**IP** **Description**\n\n`185.161.211[.]72` Hardcoded HTTP CnC, not used at the time of the analysis.\n\n`185.20.187[.]8` Mostly used to generate Let’s Encrypt certificates. Port 443 still\nanswers with memail.mea.com[.]lb. Port 444 has a “GlobalSign”\ncertificate of memail.mea.com[.]lb.\n\n`185.20.184[.]138` Live HTTP CnC. Ports 80 and 443 return interesting Django debug\ninfo.\n\n`185.20.184[.]157` Unknown usage. Basic authentication protected page on port 7070\nwith https, cert CN is ” kerteros “. Port 8083 hosts a webserver,\nbut only returns a blank page.\n\n`185.161.211[.]79` Hosted the HR phishing domains hr-suncor[.]com and hrwipro[.]com, now redirect to the legitimate website.\n\n`194.9.177[.]22` Openconnect VPN used to reach the HTTP CnC.\n\nBy correlating these IP addresses with DNS resolutions (See timeline in Appendix A), we\nidentified three domains that were most likely used to deliver the weaponized first stage\ndocuments:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nhr-suncor[.]com\n\n```\n\nThese similar looking domains names match well with the Suncor document template used\nin the attack. We have not found any specific document linked to Wipro yet. We also found\nsuspicious DNS resolution from government AE and LB domain names pointing towards\n185.20.187[.]8 for a short amount of time (~ 1 day each).\n\n[By cross-referencing this data with certificate generation records available on https://crt.sh,](https://crt.sh/)\nwe conclude that the attackers managed to take over the DNS entries of these domains and\ngenerated multiple “Let’s encrypt” certificates allowing them to transparently intercept any\nTLS exchange.\n\n**Domain** **Certificate** **Redirection**\n**Dates**\n\n```\n2018-11-06\n\n```\n```\n2018-11-06\n\n```\n```\nmail.apc.gov[.]ae https://crt.sh/?id=782678542 2018-09-23\n\n```\n```\n2018-09-15\n\n```\n```\n2018-09-12\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Cold River is a sophisticated threat actor making malicious use of DNS\ntunneling for command and control activities, compelling lure documents, and previously\nunknown implants. The campaign targets Middle Eastern organizations largely from the\nLebanon and United Arab Emirates, though, Indian and Canadian companies with interests\nin those Middle Eastern countries may have also been targeted.\n\nCold River highlights the importance of detection diversity and contextualized threat\nintelligence. Without correlating Behavioral Intelligence and Network Traffic Analysis, the full\nscope of Cold River’s capabilities would go unseen, exposing victims to additional risk.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Droppers (maldocs)**\n\n```\n9ea865e000e3e15cec15efc466801bb181ba40a1 (Suncor document)\n\n```\n```\n678ea06ebf058f33fffa1237d40b89b47f0e45e1\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**Payloads**\n\nIP addresses\n```\n185.161.211[.]72\n185.20.184[.]138\n185.20.187[.]8\n185.20.184[.]15\n185.161.211[.]79\n194.9.177[.]22\n104.148.109[.]193\n\n```\n**Domain names**\n```\n0ffice36o[.]com\nhr-suncor[.]com\nhr-wipro[.]com\nfiles-sender[.]com\nmicrosoftonedrive[.]org\n\n```\n**Certificates domain names**\n```\nmemail.mea.com[.]lb\nwebmail.finance.gov[.]lb\nmail.mgov[.]ae\nadpvpn.adpolice.gov[.]ae\nMail.apc.gov[.]ae\n\n```\n**Generated certificates**\n```\nhttps://crt.sh/?id=923463758\nhttps://crt.sh/?id=922787406\nhttps://crt.sh/?id=782678542\nhttps://crt.sh/?id=750443611\nhttps://crt.sh/?id=741047630\n\n```\n**User agent**\n\n```\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\n\n```\n\n**Filesystem artifacts**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Scheduled task**\n```\nName: “chrome updater”\nDescription: “chromium updater v 37.5.0”\nInterval: 1 minute\nExecution: “%userprofile%\\.oracleServices\\svshost_serv.exe”\n\n## Appendix A: DNS Resolution Timeline\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFootnotes\n\n1 https://www.experts-exchange.com/articles/11591/VBScript-and-Task-Scheduler-2-0\nCreating-Scheduled-Tasks.html\n\nAbout\nLatest Posts\n\n## Quentin Fois\n\nQuentin Fois is a Malware Reverse Engineer at Lastine.
