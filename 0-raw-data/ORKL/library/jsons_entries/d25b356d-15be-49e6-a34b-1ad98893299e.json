    "plain_text": "# The Good, the Bad, and the Web Bug: TA416 Increases Operational Tempo Against European Governments as Conflict in Ukraine Escalates\n\n**proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-**\neuropean\n\nMarch 7, 2022\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nProofpoint researchers have identified ongoing activity by the China-aligned APT\nactor TA416 in which the group is targeting European diplomatic entities, including\nan individual involved in refugee and migrant services.\n[This targeting is consistent with other activity reported by Proofpoint, showing an](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/asylum-ambuscade-state-actor-uses-compromised-private-ukrainian-military-emails)\ninterest in refugee policies and logistics across the APT actor landscape which\ncoincides with increased tensions and now armed conflict between Russia and\nUkraine.\nThe campaigns utilize web bugs to profile the victims before sending a variety of\nPlugX malware payloads via malicious URLs.\nTA416 has recently updated its PlugX variant, changing its encoding method and\nexpanding its configuration capabilities.\n\n## Overview\n\nSince 2020, Proofpoint researchers have observed TA416, an actor assessed to be aligned\nwith the Chinese state, utilizing web bugs to profile their targets. Commonly referred to as\ntracking pixels, web bugs embed a hyperlinked non-visible object within the body of an\nemail that, when enabled, will attempt to retrieve a benign image file from an actorcontrolled server. This provides a “sign of life” to threat actors and indicates that the\ntargeted account is valid with the user being inclined to open emails that utilize social\nengineering content. TA416 has been using web bugs to target victims prior to delivering\nmalicious URLs that have installed a variety of PlugX malware payloads. The operational\ntempo of these campaigns, specifically those against European governments, have\nincreased sharply since Russian troops began amassing on the border of Ukraine.\n\nThe use of the web bug reconnaissance technique suggests TA416 is being more\ndiscerning about which targets the group chooses to deliver malware payloads.\nHistorically, the group primarily delivered web bug URLs alongside malware URLs to\nconfirm receipt. In 2022, the group started to first profile users and then deliver malware\nURLs. This may be an attempt by TA416 to avoid having their malicious tools discovered\nand publicly disclosed. By narrowing the lens of targeting from broad phishing campaigns\nto focus on targets that have proven to be active and willing to open emails, TA416\nincreases its chance of success when following up with malicious malware payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n## What’s In a Web Bug – Delivery in 2020 and 2021\n\nStarting in early November 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified web bug\nreconnaissance campaigns targeting European diplomatic entities. Notably this activity\naligned with the escalation of tensions between Russia, Ukraine, and, by extension, NATO\nmember states in Europe. The emails first originated from a spoofed sender that\nimpersonated a Meetings Services Assistant at the United Nations General Assembly\nSecretariat. Proofpoint did not observe these campaigns targeting the United Nations\n(UN), but did observe the targeting of diplomatic entities in Europe under the pretense of\ncommunicating with the UN. The threat actor achieved this impersonation by utilizing\nthe legitimate email marketing service SMTP2Go, which allows users to alter the envelope\nsender field while using a unique sender address generated by the service.\n\nTA416 has used SMTP2Go to impersonate various European diplomatic organizations\nsince at least 2020. The threat actor in an August 2020 campaign impersonated the same\nMeetings Services Assistant at the UN General Assembly and again targeted\ngovernmental entities in Europe. In this historical campaign, TA416 delivered a DropBox\n[URL that delivered a PlugX variant aligning with Recorded Future’s analysis of \"Red](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations/)\nDelta\" PlugX malware. Proofpoint assesses that there is sizeable overlap between the\nentities TA416 and the publicly disclosed group “Red Delta.” Both campaigns from August\n2020 and November 2021 targeted European diplomatic entities and utilized SMTP2Go\nto impersonate an external diplomatic organization that may communicate with the end\ntargets. Included below is a publicly available malicious Zip file hash from August 2020\ndelivered via a DropBox URL which is attributable to TA416/Red Delta.\n\nAdvance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-General on Peacebuilding and\nSustaining Peace .zip |\n0e3e47697539f1773fb53114ab53229c0304d86ed35aec05e5f5bfdf3bd35f9a\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. TA416 August 2020 “Advance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-_\n_General on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace” PDF decoy_\n_54b491541376bda85ffb02b9bb40b9b5adba644f08b630fc1b47392625e1e60a._\n\n## From Web Bugs to PlugX\n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint researchers continued to identify web reconnaissance campaigns in November\nand December 2021 that utilized a rudimentary style of encoding and resource names.\nFundamentally, a web bug URL includes infrastructure that hosts a benign image file,\nseveral designations about the email campaign, which can include date and campaign\nname, and a unique designation for each individual user targeted in the email campaign.\nThis allows a threat actor to validate which recipients received and opened the phishing\nemail. TA416 web bugs appear rudimentary while demonstrating slight evolution over\ntime. The web bug URL structure began with an actor-controlled IP which retrieved jpg\nresources named after the email aliases of the targeted victims from the actor-controlled\nservers. Proofpoint researchers next observed base64 encoded values of the entire email\naddress.\n\nExample:\n\nhxxp://45.154.14[.]235/jdoe.jpg\nhxxp://45.154.14[.]235/amRvZUBwcm9vZnBvaW50LmNvbQ==/328.jpg\n\nResearchers identified the same method of base64 encoded target emails, including in the\nweb bug URL, consistently from August to November 2020 in TA416 campaigns that\npreceded the delivery of PlugX malware. On more than one occasion in 2020, this web\nbug technique appeared in an email alongside a Dropbox URL that ultimately delivered\n[the Trident Loader variant of PlugX malware. Proofpoint, Avira, and Recorded](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta416-goes-ground-and-returns-golang-plugx-malware-loader)\nFuture have publicly attributed this installation technique to TA416/Red Delta. In the\nabove referenced campaign from August 2020 in which TA416 impersonated UN\npersonnel, the threat actor utilized base64 encoded web bug resources representing\ntargeted emails alongside the cloud hosted URLs that delivered PlugX malware. Actorcontrolled IPs observed during web bug reconnaissance campaigns during the November\nto December 2021 period included the IP 45.154.14[.]235.\n\nBeginning on January 17, 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed TA416 threat actors\nutilizing the IP address 45.154.14[.]235 in phishing emails attempting to deliver a\nmalicious Zip file to European Diplomatic entities. These entities had previously received\nweb bug URLs in phishing emails during the prior months. Rather than the emails\ndelivering further reconnaissance URLs, this IP now attempted to deliver malicious Zip\nfiles. The phishing email also included a Dropbox URL attempting to deliver the same\nmalicious archive file. Like historical TA416 campaigns, the Zip file had a geopolitically\nthemed title, which was shared with a PDF decoy that would be later downloaded as part\nof the infection chain. For example, the campaign on January 17, 2022 included the\nfollowing Zip and PDF file titles:\n\nState_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.zip\nState_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. TA416 January 2021 PDF decoy - EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in_\n_UN human rights fora in 2022.zip._\n\nWhile historically TA416 has delivered Zip files from cloud hosting providers containing a\ndecoy file, legitimate PE file, a DLL loader, and a PlugX malware configuration DAT file,\nrecent campaigns used a different tactic. Proofpoint researchers noted that the malicious\nZip files delivered from DropBox now contain a rudimentary executable which is a\ndropper malware. This malware establishes persistence for a legitimate executable file\nused in DLL search order hijacking, as well as initiates the download of four components.\nThese components are included below and resemble the components used in the past to\ninstall PlugX malware. Public research has previously documented TA416’s propensity for\nincluding PlugX Trident Loader components and decoy in the initial delivered Zip file.\nActors in recent months use a more convoluted delivery chain, in which a PE dropper is\nused to retrieve the Trident Loader components from an actor-controlled resource. The\nmethod of installing PlugX via DLL Search Order hijacking that displays a PDF decoy\nremains constant.\n\nRequests Resulting from the Execution of Malware Dropper Executable\n\nPDF Decoy File\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/State_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\nLegitimate PotPlayer PE file used in DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious PlugX Malware Loader\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.dll\n\nPlugX Malware Configuration Executed by DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\nMost recently on February 28, 2022, TA416 began using a compromised email address of\na diplomat from a European NATO country to target a different country’s diplomatic\noffices. The targeted individual worked in refugee and migrant services. The below URL\nwas sent in a phishing email and delivered a compressed archive containing a PE dropper.\nThis dropper similarly called out to an actor-controlled URL to deliver a decoy document\nand the components of an updated Trident Loader PlugX malware payload.\n\nhxxp://www.zyber-i[.]com/europa/2022.zip\nSituation at the EU borders with\nUkraine.zip|8a7fbafe9f3395272548e5aadeb1af07baeb65d7859e7a1560f580455d7b1fac\nSituation at the EU borders with\nUkraine.exe|effd63168fc7957baf609f7492cd82579459963f80fc6fc4d261fbc68877f5a1(Stage\n1 Dropper)\nhxxp://103.107.104.19/2022/eu.docx (Decoy Document)\nhxxp://103.107.104.19/FontEDL.exe (PE Legit)\nhxxp://103.107.104.19/DocConvDll.dll (DLL Loader)\nhxxp://103.107.104.19/FontLog.dat (PlugX Encrypted Payload)\n\n## Communicates with C2\n\nhxxps://92.118.188[.]78/\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. TA416 February 28, 2022 Word document decoy – eu.docx._\n\n## A More Discerning Breed of TA416 PlugX Malware\n\nClose analysis of the delivered payloads and legitimate resources retrieved from URLs by\nthe first stage malware dropper reveals that TA416 is once again using an updated version\nof PlugX malware to target their victims. Historically, the group has relied on a variety of\nlegitimate antivirus files, including the Avast file resource wsc_proxy.exe, to begin the\nprocess of DLL search order hijacking that results in PlugX malware installation. In the\nJanuary 2022 campaigns, TA416 used the PE file potplayermini.exe to initiate DLL search\norder hijacking. This is a legitimate executable file that is part of the publicly available\n[media player Daum PotPlayer 1.5.29825, which Mandiant has previously documented as](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/abusing-dll-misconfigurations)\nbeing susceptible to search order hijacking since at least 2016. Numerous Chinese APT\ngroups, which are not directly correlated to TA416, have utilized it since that time. This\ncampaign leveraged the vulnerability of potplayermini.exe to load the file PotPlayer.dll\nwhich contains an obfuscated launcher that in turn executes the file PotPlayerDB.dat. The\nfile DocConvDll.dll has also intermittently been used as a loader of the PlugX DAT\nconfiguration files. For those that are familiar with TA416’s historic tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs), this is highly similar to the Trident Loader method which the\ngroup used to install PlugX in previous campaigns.\n\nWhile PotPlayerDB.dat is a variant of PlugX malware, TA416 has updated the payload by\nchanging both its encoding method and expanding the payload’s configuration\ncapabilities. Historically, TA416 relied on the DLL launcher to decode the PlugX payload\nutilizing an XOR key included at the offset 0 within the PlugX DAT configuration file. In\nthis case, TA416 has abandoned that approach in favor of something with less\ndependencies that is more convoluted. The latest version contains obfuscation to thwart\n\n\n-----\n\nanalysis. One of the main ways it does this is by resolving API functions during runtime.\nGenerally, malware loads a DLL, iterates over the set of exports of the DLL and hashes the\nstring, looking for a matching hash. This iteration of PlugX does standard API hashing,\nbut only to resolve the address of the functions GetProcAddress as well as LoadLibrary.\nOnce those functions are resolved properly, it loads the rest of the functions via their text\nname.\n\n_Figure 4. PlugX malware API hashing method._\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to this obfuscation attempt, most of the functions that contain the \"business\nlogic\" of the malware are obfuscated with a state machine. At a high level this obscures\nthe order of which blocks are executed within a function. It does this by maintaining a\nstate variable with many comparisons in the function. After each block, the state variable\nis modified to whatever the subsequent block should be, making analysis more difficult.\nThis sample further implements anti-analysis techniques via the malware’s design. After\nevery iteration of the state machine, the malware sample will modify the state with a XOR\noperation. This makes it difficult to analyze as the states are not hardcoded as the result\nof a function. This control obfuscation is apparent below with the highly cyclical nature of\nthe control flow graph.\n\n_Figure 5. PlugX malware control flow graph._\n\nOnce researchers defeated the PlugX anti-analysis techniques, they were able to examine\nthe malware’s configuration. Notably the configuration contained three additional fields\nthat were not present in the previous versions nor in standard PlugX malware. The new\nversion included:\n\nTwo hardcoded dates for latest write time used to filter over files within a specified\ndirectory.\nA minimum and maximum file size to filter over files within a specified directory.\nA format string that defaults to “public/Publics” that modifies characteristics of the\nfolder and hide it from the infected user.\n\nIn the past, when fields have been added to PlugX malware configurations they have\npersisted in future samples identified in subsequent campaigns. Recently, this has not\nalways proven to be true. In recent campaigns, a consistent and clear configuration that is\nrepeated has not been present. The expansion of the malware’s configuration fields\ndemonstrates that this tool is undergoing additional development by TA416. Further, the\ntype of added features that enable better filtering of victim files for exfiltration and better\nconcealment from the infected user demonstrates that the actor is going beyond anti\n\n-----\n\nanalysis to create a more functional and precise tool to use during intrusions. It also\nindicates the varying versions of the PlugX payload that are being used in a short period\nof time.\n\n## Command and Control\n\nThe January 2022 version of PlugX malware utilizes RC4 encryption along with a\nhardcoded key that is built dynamically. For communications, the data is compressed\nthen encrypted before sending to the command and control (C2) server and the same\nprocess in reverse is implemented for data received from the C2 server. Below shows the\nRC4 key \"sV!e@T#L$PH%\" as it is being passed along with the encrypted data. The data\nis compressed and decompressed via LZNT1 and RtlDecompressBuffer. During the\nJanuary 2022 campaigns, the delivered PlugX malware samples communicated with the\nC2 server 92.118.188[.]78 over port 187. In the February 2022 campaign, Proofpoint\nresearchers observed a variation in which PlugX malware used an RC4 key that was sent\nto the bot in the first HTTP response which was then used to encrypt data going to the C2\nserver.\n\n_Figure 6. PlugX malware RC4 encryption key with encrypted data._\n\n**A Rapid Pace of Malware Development**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn response to historical disclosures detailing TA416 PlugX malware infection and\nencoding methods, the group appears to have adopted a rapid rate of development for\ntheir PlugX payloads. While the distinctly TA416 installation method of a PE dropper\nretrieving Trident loaded payload components using a legitimate PE and a DLL loader file\nto load a PlugX payload remains constant, the components in this infection chain are\nregularly changing. The group uses different legitimate PE files to initiate sideloading, as\nwell as a variety of PlugX DLL loaders including the PotPlayer and DocCon versions noted\nin this publication. TA416 also uses different variants of the final PlugX payload in which\nthe communication routines are observed to be different when closely analyzed.\nAdditionally, the payload DAT file decryption method has evolved regularly since the\nbeginning of 2022. Several observed decryption schemas and a sample configuration are\nincluded below with date ranges detailing the evolution of observed PlugX payloads.\n\n_Figure 7. 2020 - 2022 PlugX DAT file decryption._\n\n_Figure 8. January 2022 – February 2022 PlugX DAT file decryption._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Mid-February 2022 PlugX DAT file decryption._\n\n_Figure 10. PlugX malware configuration sample._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nProofpoint researchers assess with high confidence that the operator identified in recent\ncampaigns delivering PlugX malware is the same as previously identified in 2020 as part\nof Recorded Future's Red Delta campaign. This assessment is based on the use of the\nsame email marketing service to deliver emails, the consistent impersonation of European\ndiplomatic entities, the repetition of web bug patterns in the 2020, 2021, and 2022\ncampaigns, the consistent victimology observed between the campaigns, a nearly identical\nfile naming structure observed between Zip and PDF decoy files, and the highly similar\nTrident Loader TTPs used for the execution of PlugX malware.\n\n\n**Tactic** **2020**\n\n**TA416 Campaigns**\n\n**Spoofing Via SMPT2Go**\n\n**Impersonation of UN Personnel**\n\n**Rudimentary Base64 Web Bugs**\n\n**Trident Loaded PlugX**\n\n**Politically Themed PDF Decoys**\n\n**Shared Zip and PDF Decoy File Names**\n\n**Targeted European Diplomatic Entities**\n\n_Figure 11. Mapping TA416 TTPs over time._\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n**2021 – 2022**\n\n**TA416 Campaigns**\n\n\nThe multiyear campaign against diplomatic entities in Europe suggests a consistent area\nof responsibility belonging to TA416. This mandate may have increased against entities in\nEurope during the current period of geopolitical conflict and economic upheaval in\n\n\n-----\n\nEurope. While historically the phishing tactics and tools of this group have not been so\nthoroughly explored, the consistent reliance on updating PlugX malware installation\nusing the Trident Loader method belies a lack of innovation on the part of TA416\nfollowing several major publications surrounding this actor. TA416 has chosen to\ncompensate for this lack of innovation with a greater tempo of variation. The group has\nproved to be pragmatic, making incremental and staggered changes to their PlugX toolkit\nrapidly and regularly altering a toolset it has used for the past number of years. Despite\nthese variations, the group’s persistent targeting of a habitual target set paired with\ningrained phishing tactics often leads to periodic discovery by threat researchers. Once\nTA416 reads this latest publication regarding their tactics, researchers at Proofpoint fully\nanticipate they will remain the metaphorical “Tubthumping” of the APT landscape.\nResearchers can publish their tactics but will never keep them down.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n**IOC**\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_ma\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_a\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/EU%20adopts%20conclusions%20on%20EU%20priorities\ndl=1\n\nhxxps://uepspr[.]com/2023/EU%20adopts%20conclusions%20on%20EU%20priorities%2\n\nhxxps://uepspr[.]com/2023/EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights fo\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights\n\nhxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/EU%20adopts%20conclusions%20on%20EU%20priorities\ndl=1\n\nhxxps://uepspr[.]com/2023/EU%20adopts%20conclusions%20on%20EU%20priorities%2\n\nhxxps://uepspr[.]com/2023/EU adopts conclusions on EU priorities in UN human rights fo\n\nhttps://upespr[.]com/Council conclusions on the European security situation.zip\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/mfa/Council%20conclusions%20on%20the%20European%20sec\n\nhxxp://www.zyber-i[.]com/europa/2022.zip\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/2023.rar\n\nCouncil conclusions on the European security situation.exe 6fd9d745faa77\n\n\nState_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.exe\n\n\n5851043b2c04\n\n\nSituation at the EU borders with Ukraine.exe effd63168fc79\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE\nCOUNCIL.exe\n\n\nb2ff5535caa1d\n\n\n-----\n\nAdvance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-General on\nPeacebuilding and Sustaining Peace.pdf\n\n\n54b491541376\n\n\nCouncil conclusions on the European security situation.pdf a4ff2c5913cce\n\nSituation at the EU borders with Ukraine.docx a07cece1fa9b3\n\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE\nCOUNCIL.pdf\n\nState_aid__Commission_approves_20222027_regional_aid_map_for_Greece.pdf\n\n\n0c2f5b6fe538d\n\nec32ff0c049bd\n\n\nPotPlayer.exe 76da9d0046fe\n\nFontEDL.exe 19870dd4d8c6\n\nPotPlayer.dll e1dbe5839326\n\nDocConvDll.dll 436d5bf9eba9\n\nDocConvDll.dll a01f353c92afc\n\nPotPlayer.dll 472822c6bdc7\n\nPotPlayerDB.dat fac8de00f0312\n\n\n-----\n\nFontLog.dat 82df9817d0a8\n\nFontLog.dat b9e330373b38\n\nPotPlayerDB.dat 03a836034360\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/2023/PotPlayer.exe\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/2023/PotPlayer.dll\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/2023/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\nhxxp://103.107.104[.]19/2022/eu.docx\n\nhxxp://103.107.104[.]19/FontEDL.exe\n\nhxxp://103.107.104[.]19/DocConvDll.dll\n\nhxxp://103.107.104[.]19/FontLog.dat\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/2022.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/FontEDL.exe\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/DocConvDll.dll\n\nhxxps://69.90.184[.]125/lt/FontLog.dat\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_ma\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.exe\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.dll\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\nhxxp://upespr[.]com/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\nhxxp://upespr[.]com/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_map_f\n\nhxxp://upespr[.]com/PotPlayer.dll\n\nhxxp://upespr[.]com/PotPlayer.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/State_aid__Commission_approves_2022-2027_regional_aid_ma\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.exe\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayer.dll\n\nhxxps://45.154.14[.]235/PotPlayerDB.dat\n\n103.107.104[.]19\n\n69.90.184[.]125\n\n45.154.14[.]235\n\nupespr[.]com\n\nwww.zyber-i[.]com\n\nhxxps://92.118.188[.]78\n\n**Emerging Threats Signatures**\n\n2851112     ETPRO TROJAN ta416 Related PlugX Activity (POST)\n\n\n-----",
