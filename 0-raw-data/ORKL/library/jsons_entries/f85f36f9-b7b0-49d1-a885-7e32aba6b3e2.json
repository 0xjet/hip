Our 11pm newscast (which](https://twitter.com/CBS6Albany?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nis starting late after football) will be unconventional. We’re working with handwritten\nnotes, and it’s going to be a bit more conversational. Tune in, and thanks for bearing\nwith us! [pic.twitter.com/D620UCD72F](https://t.co/D620UCD72F)\n\n[— Leanne DeRosa (@CBS6Leanne) October 18, 2021](https://twitter.com/CBS6Leanne/status/1449906114020225026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThis week, it was discovered that both attacks were conducted by a new ransomware known\nas Macaw Locker.\n\nIn a conversation with Emsisoft CTO Fabian Wosar, BleepingComputer was told that, based\non code analysis, MacawLocker is the latest rebrand of Evil Corp's ransomware family.\n\nBleepingComputer has also learned from sources in the cybersecurity industry that the only\n[two known Macaw Locker victims are Sinclair and](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/sinclair-broadcast-hack-linked-to-notorious-russian-cybergang) [Olympus.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/olympus-americas-ransomware-evil-corp/)\n\nSources also shared the private Macaw Locker victim pages for two attacks, where the threat\nactors demand a 450 bitcoin ransom, or $28 million, for one attack and $40 million for the\nother victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is unknown what company is associated with each ransom demand.\n\nThe Macaw Locker ransomware will encrypt victims' files and append the .macaw extension\nto the file name when conducting attacks.\n\nWhile encrypting files, the ransomware will also create ransom notes in each folder\nnamed macaw_recover.txt. For each attack, the ransom note contains a unique victim\nnegotiation page on the Macaw Locker's Tor site and an associated decryption ID, or\ncampaign ID, as shown below.\n\n**Macaw Locker ransom note**\nThe gang's dark web negotiation site contains a brief introduction to what happened to the\nvictim, a tool to decrypt three files for free, and a chatbox to negotiate with the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Macaw Locker Tor**\n\n**payment negotiation site**\nNow that Macaw Locker has been exposed as an Evil Corp variant, we will likely see the\nthreat actors rebrand their ransomware again.\n\nThis constant cat-and-mouse game will likely never end until Evil Corp stops performing\nransomware attacks or sanctions are lifted.\n\nHowever, neither of those scenarios is likely to take place in the immediate future.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
