Such builders indicate the author's intent to bundle malware generation functionalities\nfor easy distribution and use by operators, customers and affiliates.\n\nWe've also observed some resemblance to the tactics and techniques used by a known\n[crimeware actor \"Aggah,\" especially the final payload delivery stages. Aggah has traditionally](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/upgraded-aggah-malspam-campaign.html)\nutilized highly modular infection chains with a focus on hosting malicious payloads on public\nrepositories such as Pastebin, Web Archive and Blogger.\n\n## How did it work?\n\nThe campaigns targeting Latin American countries consist of macro-enabled Office documents\nthat act as the entry points into the infection. What follows is a modular chain of PowerShell and\n[VB scripts, all working towards disabling anti-virus protection features such as AMSI and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal)\neventually delivering the RAT payloads.\n\nWe've also observed some Aggah campaigns using similar infection chains including scripts\nand similar commodity malware. However, unlike Aggah, the operators working the Latin\nAmerican campaigns tend to use either compromised or attacker-controlled websites to host\ntheir components and payloads instead of using public hosting services such as Blogger,\nPastebin and Web Archive.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infection chains used in these campaigns are built using a .NET-based crypter called 3losh\ncrypter rat\" [SIC]. This crypter has been actively advertised on social media by the authors and\nused to generate infection chains for campaigns operated by the crypter's authors themselves.\n\n## So what?\n\nIt is important for defenders to identify distinct adversaries and their tactics. The usage of\ncrypters makes it [difficult to do so since completely disjointed actors can now generate identical](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/08/attribution-puzzle.html)\ninfection chains for unrelated campaigns. Our research uncovers one such scenario where\nthere are three distinct campaigns identified using the 3losh crypter: the Latin American\ncampaigns, the Aggah campaigns and those operated by the crypter authors.\n\nAll these campaigns however, aim to distribute commodity RAT families. Commodity malware\n[families are increasingly being used by both crimeware and APT groups to infect their targets.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\nRATs in particular are extremely popular since they provide a wide range of functionalities to\ntheir operators to take advantage of the infected systems. These functionalities can be used for\nmalicious activities such as:\n\nPerforming preliminary reconnaissance to scope out victim networks and infrastructure.\n[Deploying more malware such as ransomware and wipers to disrupt enterprise](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/11/crat-and-plugins.html)\noperations.\nExecuting arbitrary commands.\nExfiltrating confidential and proprietary information from enterprises.\nStealing credentials, opening up more systems and services to unauthorized access.\n\n## Dropper/Crypter developer threat actor\n\nThis threat actor uses the nickname \"alosh.\" We have found indications that they've been active\nsince at least 2018. This actor is the developer of the \"3losh crypter rat\" crypter. They advertise\nservices on Facebook and YouTube where they keep several videos demonstrating evasion\ncapabilities of the 3losh crypter or 3losh RAT. Although we can't establish a direct link between\nthe actor and the current campaign, there are several links between this actor and previous\ncampaigns, making this actor the developer and operator of some malware campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nFacebook image advertising the infection builder.\n\nTheir YouTube page shows several videos that explain how to use similar builders to bypass\nseveral commercial anti-virus products.\n\nThe crypter author's YouTube page.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe discovered an email address of the crypter author inside one of these videos. Pivoting off\nthis email, we found a huge number of payloads hosted at archive[.]org.\n\nYouTube video still from the crypter's author displaying their email ID.\n\nThis leads us to conclude that, in some cases, the actor is the developer and operator — there\nare also plenty of videos on Instagram and YouTube where the developer demonstrates that\nthey have compromised several websites.\n\nOn the Web Archive, the actor uses two different usernames: 3losh-rat and alo0ch0011. During\nour research, the payloads were removed from the archive due to breach of terms and\nconditions. However, we still listed them based on the cache. Most of these payloads had\n[several stages finally delivering njrat.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.njrat)\n\n\n-----\n\nCrypter author hosting malicious artifacts on archive[.]org.\n\n## The current campaign\n\n### The threat actor\n\nWe believe the threat actor behind the current campaign targeting Latin America is not the\ncrypter developer. In fact, there are several indications that this actor is, in fact, a Brazilian.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are several technical and tactical links that support this assertion.\n\nTo begin with, one of the most prolific domains owned and operated by the threat actors\n(updatewin32[.]xyz) was registered in Brazil.\n\nWhois record for domain updatewin32[.]xyz.\n\nTalos discovered several maldocs predominantly named in Portuguese. One such malicious\ndocument was called \"Documento.doc\" (Portuguese for \"document\"). Looking at the several\nfiles that constitute the doc file, there are two files called \"AquiTaLimpo,\" one with the XML\nextension and another with \".xml.rels\" extension. \"AquiTaLimpo\" is Portuguese slang for \"here is\nclean.\"\n\nConstituent files in the open XML-based maldoc.\n\nThese XLSM files had VBA macro code that would download the main payload. The macro\nname is \"EstaPastaDeTrabalho,\" as it can be seen in the screenshot below, which roughly\ntranslates to \"this work folder\" — again translated from Portuguese.\n\n\n-----\n\nPortuguese stream and macro names used in the maldocs.\n\nAdditional metadata indicates the creator and the last modified tags of the maldoc are also\nwritten in Portuguese, as can be seen below. These findings indicate that the operating\nenvironment, especially the maldoc generation systems of the actor use the Portuguese\nlanguage.\n\nMaldoc metadata showing the creator and \"last modified by\" party names in Portuguese.\n\nThe creator is a common Portuguese language name, however, the \"last modified by\" tag can\nbe translated to \"Knight from Troy,\" implying a trojan. The same name appears on the properties\nof the XLSM files.\n\nMalware authors and campaign operators will frequently submit their payloads to public\ndetection systems such as VirusTotal to check the efficacy of anti-virus products against its\nmalware. This is a practice seen frequently across many crimeware groups.\n\nThe Brazilian threat actor used this practice to submit test files with Portuguese names to\nVirusTotal in June and July 2021 — all files submitted from Brazil. These files are named\n\"Exploit pronto para envio.rar,\" which translates to \"exploit ready to be sent.\"\n\nEarly versions of the test maldocs were true test copies, simply executed calc.exe. At the time\nof writing, there were approximately 11 files submitted with slight differences, all submitted from\nthe same Brazilian origin around the same time.\n\n\n-----\n\nPreliminary versions of the test maldcos executing calc.exe.\n\nOngoing testing conducted by the actors consists of the same file names, author name,\nmalicious domains and URLs as those used in the Latin American campaign embedded in\nthem.\n\nA quick look at the metadata of these test files also confirms the usage of Brazilian Portuguese\nto build the test maldocs.\n\nBrazilian Portuguese language code in the test maldocs.\n\nAs we said above, the crypter author advertises the crypter on social networks like Facebook,\n\n\n-----\n\nInstagram or YouTube. We ve found Portuguese-speaking users either praising the crypter or\nasking for it.\n\nAs described in subsequent sections, the text on the email is in near perfect Brazilian\nPortuguese, the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code in the PPAM file attached to the email,\nshows that it was written in a Portuguese language office installation, since the VBA module is\ncalled \"Módulo1,\" which is Portuguese for \"module1.\"\n\n### Victimology\n\nThe countries targeted by this set of attacks are primarily based in Latin America:\n\n\n-----\n\nTargeted countries.\n\nThe campaign uses maldocs posing as something as inconspicuous as reservation dates for\nhotels.\n\nA good example of a maldoc's file name is \"Fechas informativas para reservar Amérian Portal\ndel Iguazú,'' which roughly translates to \"Informative dates to reserve Amérian Portal del\nIguazú\" (\"Amérian Portal del Iguazú'' is a hotel in Argentina.). It is worth noting that the content\nof the email is in near perfect Brazilian Portuguse.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese campaigns focussing on Latin American countries usually use malspam as a means to\ndeliver the malicious macro-enabled document to their victims.\n\nAn example of a malspam email delivering a PPAM maldoc as early as Jan. 19, 2021.\n\n### Infection chain\n\nSome of the Word documents discovered for this campaign use a chain of relationships\ndefinitions to load embedded XLSM files which contain the actual VBA code that will download\n\n\n-----\n\nthe payloads.\n\nAdditional malicious XLSM files loaded during runtime.\n\nThe maldocs are Office Open XML documents consisting of two key relationship definition files the main one called \"AquiTaLimpo.xml.rels,\" and another one called \"comments.xml.rels,\" which\nwill load the embedded XLSM files which contain the VBA code.\n\nMalicious relationship file linking to the embedded XLSM files.\n\nWhen the Word document is open, Excel is also loaded to open the XLSM files embedded in\nthe document and will launch the macro to download the payloads.\n\nWe also discovered a variety of the maldocs that are macro-enabled files such as PPAM and\nXLAM serving as entry points of the infection chain. PPAM files are add-on files used by\nMicrosoft PowerPoint to add additional functionality such as custom macros, tools and\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands. These macros enabled maldocs act as entry points to the infection chain. Finally,\nthe infection chain drops a popular RAT that can be njRAT or AsyncRAT.\n\nThe earliest infection chain discovered contains a macro that downloads and executes a remote\nHTA file from an attacker-controlled location.\n\nMalicious macro in the PPAM.\n\n**Stage 1A: Malicious HTA**\n\nThe malicious HTA is simply an escaped JavaScript snippet that, in turn, executes a VBScript\n(embedded in an HTA) to download and execute the next stage (Stage #2 PowerShell script) of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe infection chain.\n\nStage #1A malicious HTA containing escaped JavaScript code.\n\n\n-----\n\nUn-escaped VB code used to download and execute Stage 2 on the endpoint.\n\n**Stage 2: PS1 Script**\n\nThe powershell script executed on the endpoint is the de-facto instrumentor of the infection\nchain.\n\nThis script performs the following actions on the endpoint:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Change the current user s Startup folders to those specified in the script by modify the\n\nregistry values:\n\nHKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders | Startup\n= <custom_directory>\nHKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell Folders | Startup =\n<custom_directory>\nwhere\n<custom_directory> = Directory created by the malicious ps1 script.\n\n2. Create a custom VBS (Stage #2A) in this modified Startup directory to execute a\n\ndownloaded Powershell (ps1) script (Stage #3 e.g. \"msi.ps1\") across reboots.\n\nVBScript created in a custom Startup folder to run a ps1 downloaded subsequently.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. The script will then check for the presence of five Anti-Virus products on the endpoint.\n\nBased on the AV found it will download a specific version of the ps1 specified in the\nprevious step (Step 2 and Stage 3 — msi.ps1 above) and execute the VB script created in\nStage 2A.\n\nAV product-based Stage 4 script download and execution.\n\nThe AV products checked by the script are:\n\n1. ESET Security\n2. Avast\n3. McAfee\n4. Malwarebytes\n5. AVG\n\n4. If no AV products are found on the endpoint, the script will perform the following actions:\n\n1. Create four configuration scripts on the endpoint.\n\n2. Script 1 is used to modify the \"windir\" path to execute itself when a user or\n\napplication accesses the \"windir\" environment variable. The script also runs Script 3\nif the current user is an Administrator.\n\n\n-----\n\nModify the \"windir\" path to execute itself.\n\n3. Script 2 is used to create exclusions for Microsoft Defender for specific paths,\n\nexecutables and to deploy a specific .Net framework:\n\nAdd-MpPreference -ExclusionPath C:\\\n\nAdd-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess powershell.exe\n\nAdd-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess Wscript.exe\nDism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFX3\n\n4. Script 3 is used to run Script 2.\n5. Script 4 is used to run Script 1.\n\n6. Execute Script 4 on the endpoint.\n\nThe execution of these scripts is convoluted and the following diagram illustrates the\nexecutions:\n\nMini-scripts execution order.\n\n\n-----\n\n7. Finally, the parent ps1 script will download another version of the Stage 4 script and\n\nexecute it via the Stage 2A VB script.\n8. Once the configuration scripts have completed execution, they are deleted from the\n\nendpoint.\n\n**Stage 3: PS1**\n\nThe Stage 3 ps1 is simple and consists of three key components:\n\n1. Hexlified injector DLL: This DLL is used to run a specified process and inject the\n\naccompanying malware into it.\n2. Hexlified malware payload: either njRAT or AsyncRAT.\n\n3. Base64-encoded or plaintext command to reflective load the injector DLL into the\n\npowershell process with the target process' image path and malware payload bytes\npassed as an argument to the injector. An example of the reflective loading\ncommand used is:\n\n[Reflection.Assembly]::Load($H5).GetType('VBNET.PE').GetMethod('Run').Invoke($null,\n\n[object[]] (\n'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\aspnet_compiler.exe',$H1))\n\nwhere\n\n$H5 = injector DLL bytes\n\n$H1 = malware payload bytes\n\naspnet_compiler.exe = target process to inject the payload into. May vary for\ndifferent instances of the infections.\n\n\n-----\n\nStage 3 ps1 script.\n\nThe overall infection chain is:\n\nComplete infection chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have also observed minor variations in the infection chains where some of the (mini)\nscripts used in Stage 2 are hosted independently, downloaded and executed during the\ninfection process. This is another example of a threat actor modularizing their infection\nchains to be able to control/update different stages of its attack.\n\nThe executables accompanying the Stage 3 PowerShell script consist of:\n\nInjector DLL: This DLL accepts two arguments:\n\nThe filepath of a process to be spawned, hollowed and replaced with the\naccompanying malware payload.\nMalware payload bytes to be injected into the hollowed out target process.\nMalware payload: The actual malware payload to be deployed on the endpoint.\n\nThe DLL is a simple injector based on .NET. The DLL is usually obfuscated with .NET\nReactor which can be easily deobfuscated using de4dot. There is only one exported\nmethod that takes the two arguments mentioned above and deploys the malware payload\ninto the target process.\n\nThe injection method is a straight process hollowing, following all the usual steps. If any\nerror occurs during the injection it will kill the target process and retry five times before\ngiving up.\n\n[Interestingly, the DLL which is a modified version of RunPE, also contains code to change](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/CSharp-RunPE/blob/master/RunPE/RunPE.cs)\nACL to kernel objects, which is never called, indicating either a work-in-progress or\nredundant code borrowed from somewhere else but never used.\n\n### Malware Payloads\n\n[The malware payloads found so far belong to two families AsyncRAT and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.asyncrat) [njRAT.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.njrat)\n\nAsyncRAT and njRAT are well-known and highly prolific RATs used by crimeware groups\nand APTs.\n\nMany malware families use victim names or group IDs to identify different types of\ninfections. This is done so that campaign operators can easily identify infections for\nadministration and deploy additional malware to their victims.\n\nNow, AsyncRAT and njRAT both use these victim identification methods. While njRAT\nidentifies victims using the \"victim name,\" AsyncRAT uses a \"group name\" to keep track of\ninfections and their respective groups.\n\nThe victim identifiers found embedded in the RATs were indicative of their targeting of\nLatin American countries. This finding matches with the targeting tactics, themes and\nlanguages used in the maldocs employed in these attacks. Some of these victim\nidentifiers (specific to Latin America) used are:\n\n\n-----\n\n### The infection chain builder\n\nTalos also discovered a builder used by the operators of the attacks to create multiple\nscripts used in various stages of the attack chain. This builder is named \"Crypter 3losh\nRAT.\" This builder contains a set of malicious scripts embedded in it in the form of\nresources which are modified based on the inputs provided by the operator to generate\nthe various scripts. The builder is built in .NET and can carry out a variety of malicious\nactions, which we will outline below.\n\n**Build Stage 1A scripts**\n\nThe builder only supports the generation of the VBScripts used in the Stage 1A HTAs. The\nembedded VBScript modified is an older version used in previous attack campaigns by the\noperators.\n\nThe builder accepts the URL for the next stage and generates a VBScript. The VBScript is\ndisplayed to the user in a textbox on the UI but also saved to the builder's working\ndirectory with the name \"alosh-rat.vbs.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nStage 1A VBScript generated in the bottom left text box based on the Stage 2 URL\nspecified in the text box at the top.\n\n**Build Stage 2 scripts**\n\nThe second-stage scripts are built using an embedded PS1 script. This UI accepts two\nURLs for the Stage 3 PS1 scripts and spits out a file called \"3.txt\" in the current user's\nDesktop folder.\n\n\n-----\n\nBuilder UI for creating the Stage 2 scripts with the Stage 3 scripts being used as inputs.\n\n**Build Stage 3 scripts**\n\nThe Stage 3 scripts are perhaps the most important part of the infection chain. These\nscripts are responsible for unhexlifying the injector DLL and malware payload and in turn\ndeploying both to infect the victim's endpoint.\n\nAgain, the builder here uses two embedded PS1 scripts as templates. These templates\nalready contain the hex representation of the injector DLL. This builder UI accepts the a\nlocal filepath of (upto) two malware payloads to be embedded in the generated Stage 3\nscripts called \"1.txt\" and \"2.txt,\" respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nStage 3 builder UI accepting path to the RAT binaries.\n\nThe builder contains references to its creator on Facebook, YouTube and Skype. The\nYouTube page shows several videos which explain how to use the builder to bypass\nseveral commercial anti-virus.\n\n## The Aggah connection\n\nMany distinct malware campaigns sometimes tend to have commonalities and overlap in\ntheir TTPs. At times, this is due to the use of the same publicly or semi-privately available\ntools, builders and malware-as-a-service. An interesting commonality between the Latin\nAmerican and Aggah campaigns seen recently are the Stage 3 PowerShell scripts. They\nutilize the same structure, syntax and semantics, down to the exact variable names.\nIdentical Stage 3 PowerShell scripts are also present in the \"3losh rat\" crypter/Builder\ndescribed previously. This indicates a common source of malicious code base for both\nthese campaign sets or the use of a common crypter to build infection chains.\n\nThe malware families distributed by Aggah are also very similar to those seen in the Latin\nAmerican campaigns, i.e. AsyncRAT and njRAT.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are, however, a few distinctions between the two campaigns sets:\n\nAggah relies heavily on the use of URL redirection services in their campaigns.\nSpecifically using bitly, j[.]mp etc. We have not observed the use of these services in\nthe Latin American campaigns.\nAggah is also known to heavily abuse public hosting services such as Blogger,\nPastebin, Web Archive etc. to host their malicious components. The Latin American\ncampaigns however, indicate that the operators tend to use either compromised or\nattacker controlled websites to host their components and payloads.\n\nThus there are three distinct campaigns utilizing the same Crypter and infection scripts:\n\nThe campaigns conducted by the crypter author \"Alosh\" — also seen abusing\narchive[.]org to host their malicious payloads.\nThe campaigns conducted by the Bralizian threat actor targeting Latin America.\nThe campaigns were conducted by the crimeware group \"Aggah\" using the same\nscripts found in the \"3losh rat\" crypter.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis campaign details a crypter used by operators to build infection artifacts for spreading\nmalware in Latin America with a focus on the travel and hospitality industry. The campaign\nstarted in October 2020 and is currently ongoing. The fact that the actor is regional does\nprovide the advantage of being able to write more targeted and perfect emails. This is a\ngood example on how an actor can inflict losses to organizations without being part of an\nAPT or a crimeware syndicate.\n\nThe variety and the ease of generating infection artifacts via Crypters indicates that the\nattackers will likely expand their net of victims to more industries and geographies.\n\nThe threat actor authoring the crypter primarily aims to sell it as a service. We've observed\nthe authors' advertise their crypters on Facebook, YouTube and other social media.\nHowever, we've also discovered that the crypter's authors have conducted their own\nmalware campaigns abusing archive[.]org to deliver commodity RATs.\n\nThe highly modular structure of the Latin American attack indicates a focus on stealth to\ndeliver two widely popular RAT families of AsynRAT and njRAT. These techniques along\nwith other indicators are shared with the Aggah group indicating that the crypter author\nmight have sold it to both parties.\n\nOrganizations should remain vigilant against such threats as they are likely to proliferate in\nthe future.\n\n## Coverage\n\n\n-----\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
