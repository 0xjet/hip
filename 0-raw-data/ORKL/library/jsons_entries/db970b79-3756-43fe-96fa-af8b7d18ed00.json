    "plain_text": "# Threat actor leverages coin miner techniques to stay under the radar – here’s how to spot them\n\n**microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/11/30/threat-actor-leverages-coin-miner-techniques-to-stay-under-the-radar-heres-**\nhow-to-spot-them\n\nNovember 30, 2020\n\nCryptocurrency miners are typically associated with cybercriminal operations, not\nsophisticated nation state actor activity. They are not the most sophisticated type of threats,\nwhich also means that they are not among the most critical security issues that defenders\naddress with urgency. Recent campaigns from the nation-state actor BISMUTH take\nadvantage of the low-priority alerts coin miners cause to try and fly under the radar and\nestablish persistence.\n\nBISMUTH, which shares similarities with OceanLotus or APT32, has been running\nincreasingly complex cyberespionage attacks as early as 2012, using both custom and opensource tooling to target large multinational corporations, governments, financial services,\neducational institutions, and human and civil rights organizations. But in campaigns from\nJuly to August 2020, the group deployed Monero coin miners in attacks that targeted both\nthe private sector and government institutions in France and Vietnam.\n\nBecause BISMUTH’s attacks involved techniques that ranged from typical to more advanced,\ndevices with common threat activities like phishing and coin mining should be elevated and\ninspected for advanced threats. More importantly, organizations should prioritize reducing\nattack surface and hardening networks against the full range of attacks. In this blog, we’ll\nprovide in-depth technical details about the BISMUTH attacks in July and August 2020 and\nmitigation recommendations for building organizational resilience.\n\nWhile this actor’s operational goals remained the same—establish continuous monitoring\nand espionage, exfiltrating useful information as is it surfaced—their deployment of coin\nminers in their recent campaigns provided another way for the attackers to monetize\ncompromised networks. Considering some of the group’s traditional targets are human and\ncivil rights organizations, BISMUTH attacks demonstrate how attackers give little regard to\nservices they impact.\n\nThe use of coin miners by BISMUTH was unexpected, but it was consistent with the group’s\nlongtime methods of blending in. This pattern of blending in is particularly evident in these\nrecent attacks, starting from the initial access stage: spear-phishing emails that were\nspecially crafted for one specific recipient per target organization and showed signs of prior\nreconnaissance. In some instances, the group even corresponded with the targets, building\neven more believability to convince targets to open the malicious attachment and start the\ninfection chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe other way that BISMUTH attempted to blend in and hide in plain sight was the heavy\nuse of DLL side-loading, a technique in which a legitimate DLL is replaced with a malicious\none so that the latter is loaded when the associated application is run. In their recent attacks,\nBISMUTH utilized copies of various legitimate software to load malicious DLL files and\nperform tasks in the context of these legitimate applications. To perform DLL sideloading,\nBISMUTH introduced outdated versions of various applications, including Microsoft\nDefender Antivirus. They also leveraged the Sysinternals DebugView tool, the McAfee ondemand scanner, and Microsoft Word 2007.\n\nBlending in was important for BISMUTH because the group spent long periods of time\nperforming discovery on compromised networks until they could access and move laterally to\nhigh-value targets like servers, where they installed various tools to further propagate or\nperform more actions. At this point in the attack, the group relied heavily on evasive\nPowerShell scripts, making their activities even more covert.\n\nThe coin miners also allowed BISMUTH to hide its more nefarious activities behind threats\nthat may be perceived to be less alarming because they’re “commodity” malware. If we\nlearned anything from “commodity” banking trojans that bring in human-operated\nransomware, we know that common malware infections can be indicators of more\nsophisticated cyberattacks and should be treated with urgency and investigated and resolved\ncomprehensively.\n\n## Initial access\n\nBISMUTH attempted to gain initial access by sending specially crafted malicious emails from\na Gmail account that appears to have been made specifically for this campaign. It’s likely the\ngroup conducted reconnaissance using publicly available sources and chose individual\n\n\n-----\n\ntargets based on their job function. Each email was sent to only one recipient at each target\norganization and used tailored subject lines and lure themes, for example:\n\nDự thảo hợp đồng (translates from Vietnamese to “Draft Contract”)\nỨng tuyển – Trưởng ban nghiên cứu thị trường (translates from Vietnamese to\n“Application form – Head of Market Research”)\n\nOf note, the group sent several replies to one of these emails, which indicated that they\ncorresponded with some targets before convincing them to open the malicious document\nattachment and inadvertently launch the payload. When opened, the malicious .doc file\ndropped several files in the hidden ProgramData folder: (1) MpSvc.dll, a malicious DLL with\nthe same name as a legitimate Microsoft Defender Antivirus DLL, and (2) a copy\nof MsMpEng.exe the legitimate Microsoft Defender Antivirus executable.\n\nThe malicious document then added a scheduled task that launched the MsMpEng.execopy\nand sideloaded the malicious MpSvc.dll. Because the latest versions of Microsoft Defender\nAntivirus are no longer susceptible to DLL sideloading, BISMUTH used an older copy to load\nthe malicious DLL and establish a persistent command-and-control (C2) channel to the\ncompromised device and consequently the network.\n\nUsing the newly established channel, the group dropped several files for the next stages of\nthe attack, including a .7z archive, a copy of Word 2007, and another DLL, wwlib.dll. While\nit used the same name as a legitimate Microsoft Word DLL, wwlib.dll was a copy of\nKerrDown, a family of custom malware exclusive to BISMUTH. This file was subsequently\nsideloaded by the dropped copy of Word 2007—a technique used by BISMUTH extensively\nto load malicious code from a DLL file in the context of a legitimate process\nlike winword.exe.\n\nBISMUTH established another persistence method by dropping another copy of Word 2007\nin a subfolder in ProgramData. The group then created a scheduled task that launched that\ncopy in the same malicious manner every 60 minutes – further increasing their chances of\ngoing undetected and maintaining their presence.\n\n## Discovery\n\nOnce established as a scheduled task, the co-opted Word 2007 process dropped and loaded a\nscanning tool popular among attackers, NbtScan.exe. BISMUTH then immediately used the\nscanning tool to scan an IP address range within the organization. Following this network\nscan, the Word 2007 process launched a malicious script using a living-off-the-landbinary, rundll32.exe, resulting in a scan on a myriad of common ports, including 21, 22, 389,\n139, and 1433. BISMUTH listed devices with open ports in a .csv file.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile network scanning was underway, the group performed other reconnaissance activities.\nThey gathered information about domain and local administrators, checked whether users\nhad local administrative privileges, and collected device information—aggregating results in\na .csv for exfiltration. In addition, the group once again used MsMpEng.exe with the\nmalicious sideloaded DLL to connect to another device that appears to have been designated\nby BISMUTH at some point during the attack as an internal C2 foothold and exfiltration\nstaging device.\n\n## Continued lateral movement, discovery, and intel gathering\n\nAfter a month of continual discovery on compromised devices, the group moved laterally to a\nserver and copied over a malicious DLL that masqueraded as the system file mpr.dll and a\ncopy of the Sysinternals DebugView tool. They dropped the tool onto different devices using\nSMB remote file copy, using file names related to popular Japanese video game characters\nand a seemingly random word. The actors then registered and launched malicious services\nmultiple times, launching DebugView tool to connect to multiple Yahoo websites and\nconfirm Internet connectivity, followed by a connection to their C2 infrastructure.\n\nAt this point, BISMUTH switched to running their attacks using PowerShell, quickly\nlaunching multiple script cmdlets. First, they dumped credentials from the Security Account\nManager (SAM) database using the Empire PowerDump command and then quickly deleted\nPowerShell event logs to erase records generated by Script Block Logging. They then\ncontinued their discovery efforts using a PowerShell script that gathered user and group\ninformation and sent the gathered data to .csv files.\n\nThe script collected the following information about each user:\n\n_description, distinguishedname, lastlogontimestamp, logoncount, mail, name,_\n_primarygroupid, pwdlastset, samaccountname, userprincipalname, whenchanged,_\n_whencreated_\n\nAnd the following information about each domain group:\n\n_adspath, description, distinguishedname, groupType, instancetype, mail, member,_\n_memberof, name, objectsid, samaccountname,whenchanged, whencreated_\n\nNext, the group exported directory forest and domain organizational unit (OU) information.\nThey then started connecting to dozens of devices using WMI. Following that, they collected\ncredentials by dumping security logs under Event ID 680, possibly targeting logs related to\nNTLM fallbacks. Lastly, the group used the system tool Nltest.exe to gather domain trust info\nand pinged multiple servers they have identified by name during reconnaissance. Some of\nthese servers appear to be database and file servers that could have contained high-value\ninformation for espionage objectives typically pursued by BISMUTH.\n\n\n-----\n\nBISMUTH then installed a Cobalt Strike beacon. The group dropped a .rar file and extracted\nits contents—McOds.exe, which is a copy of the McAfee on-demand scanner, and a malicious\nDLL—into the SysWOW64 folder. The group then created a scheduled task that launched the\ncopy of the McAfee on-demand scanner with SYSTEM privileges and sideloaded the\nmalicious DLL. This persistence mechanism established a connection to their Cobalt Strike\nserver infrastructure. To clean up evidence, they deleted the dropped McAfee binary.\n\nIn terms of targets for this campaign, there were some commonalities among targets located\nin Vietnam that Microsoft has assessed to be tied to their previous designation as stateowned enterprises (SOEs). The observed BISMUTH activity in Vietnam targeted\norganizations that included former SOEs previously operated by the government of Vietnam,\nentities that have acquired a significant portion of a former SOE, and entities that conduct\ntransactions with a Vietnamese government agency. Although the group’s specific objectives\nfor these recent attacks cannot be defined with high confidence, BISMUTH’s past activities\nhave included operations in support of broader espionage goals.\n\n## Coin miner deployment and credential theft\n\nAs mentioned, BISMUTH deployed coin miners during these attacks. To do this, they first\ndropped a .dat file and loaded the file using rundll32.exe, which in turn downloaded a copy\nof the 7-zip tool named 7za.exe and a ZIP file. They then used 7-Zip to extract a Monero coin\nminer from the ZIP file and registered the miner as a service named after a common Virtual\nMachine process. Each coin miner they deployed had a unique wallet address that earned\nover a thousand U.S. dollars combined during the attacks.\n\nAfter deploying coin miners as their distraction technique, BISMUTH then focused much of\nits efforts on credential theft. They registered multiple malicious services that\nused %comspec%—a relative reference to cmd.exe commonly used by attackers—to run the\nrenamed DebugView tool while loading a malicious DLL. The group used DebugView and the\nmalicious DLL in a fairly unexpected fashion to launch Base64-encoded Mimikatz\ncommands using one of several Windows processes: makecab.exe, systray.exe, w32tm.exe,\n_bootcfg.exe, diskperf.exe, esentutl.exe, and typeperf.exe._\n\nThey ran the following Mimikatz commands that require SYSTEM or Debug privileges:\n\n_sekurlsa::logonpasswords full–lists all account and user password hashes, typically_\nuser and computer credentials for recently logged on users\n_lsadump::lsa /inject—injects LSASS to retrieve credentials and request the LSA Server_\nto grab credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database and Active\nDirectory (AD)\n\nAfter running these commands, the co-opted DebugView tool connected to multiple attackercontrolled domains, likely to exfiltrate stolen credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the affected organizations worked to evict BISMUTH from their networks, Microsoft\nsecurity researchers saw continued activity involving lateral movement to other devices,\ncredential dumping, and planting of multiple persistence methods. This highlights the\ncomplexity of responding to a full-blown intrusion and the significance of taking quick action\nto resolve alerts that flag initial stages of an attack.\n\n## Building organizational resilience against attacks that blend in\n\nBISMUTH attacks put strong emphasis on hiding in plain sight by blending in with normal\nnetwork activity or common threats that attackers anticipate will get low-priority attention.\nThe combination of social engineering and use of legitimate applications to sideload\nmalicious DLLs entail multiple layers of protection focused on stopping threats at the earliest\npossible stage and mitigating the progression of attacks if they manage to slip through. Here\nare mitigation recommendations that organizations can implement to limit exposure:\n\nLimit the attack surface that attackers can leverage for initial access:\n\nEducate end users about protecting personal and business information in social media,\nfiltering unsolicited communication, identifying lures in spear-phishing email, and\nreporting of reconnaissance attempts and other suspicious activity.\n[Configure Office 365 email filtering settings to ensure blocking of phishing & spoofed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365-atp?view=o365-worldwide)\n[emails, spam, and emails with malware.
