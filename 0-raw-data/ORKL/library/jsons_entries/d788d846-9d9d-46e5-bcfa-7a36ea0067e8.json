Were you\n\namazed by the diversity of TV channels and radio stations\n\navailable? Have you ever looked in wonder at satellite\n\nphones or satellite­based Internet connections wondering\n\nwhat makes them tick? What if we told you that there’s\n\nmore to satellite­based Internet connections than\n\nentertainment, traffic and weather? Much, much more.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen you are an APT group, you need to deal with many\n\ndifferent problems. One of them, and perhaps the biggest,\n\nis the constant seizure and takedown of domains and\n\nservers used for command­and­control (C&C). These\n\nservers are constantly appropriated by law enforcement or\n\nshut down by ISPs. Sometimes they can be used to trace\n\nthe attackers back to their physical locations.\n\nSome of the most advanced threat actors or users of\n\ncommercial hacking tools have found a solution to the\n\ntakedown problem — the use of satellite­based Internet\n\nlinks. In the past, we’ve seen three different actors using\n\nsuch links to mask their operations. The most interesting\n\nand unusual of them is the Turla group.\n\nAlso known as Snake or Uroburos, names which come\n\nfrom its top class rootkit, the Turla cyber­espionage group\n\nhas been active for more than 8 years. Several papers\n\nhave been published about the group’s operations, but\n\n[until the Epic Turla research was published by Kaspersky](http://securelist.com/analysis/publications/65545/the-epic-turla-operation/)\n\nLab, little information was available about the more\n\nunusual aspects of their operations, such as the first\n\nstages of infection through watering­hole attacks.\n\nWhat makes the Turla group special is not just the\n\ncomplexity of its tools, which include the Uroboros rootkit,\n\naka “Snake”, as well as mechanisms designed to bypass\n\nair gaps through multi­stage proxy networks inside LANs,\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this blog, we hope to shed more light on the satellite­\n\nbased C&C mechanisms that APT groups, including the\n\nTurla/Snake group, use to control their most important\n\nvictims. As the use of these mechanisms becomes more\n\npopular, it’s important for system administrators to deploy\n\nthe correct defense strategies to mitigate such attacks.\n\nFor IOCs, see the appendix.\n\n## Technical details\n\nAlthough relatively rare, since 2007 several elite APT\n\ngroups have been using — and abusing — satellite links\n\nto manage their operations — most often, their C&C\n\ninfrastructure. Turla is one of them. Using this approach\n\noffers some advantages, such as making it hard to identify\n\nthe operators behind the attack, but it also poses some\n\nrisks to the attackers.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s valuable because the true location\n\nand hardware of the C&C server cannot be easily\n\ndetermined or physically seized. Satellite­based Internet\n\nreceivers can be located anywhere within the area\n\ncovered by a satellite, and this is generally quite large.\n\nThe method used by the Turla group to hijack the\n\ndownstream links is highly anonymous and does not\n\nrequire a valid satellite Internet subscription.\n\nOn the other hand, the disadvantage comes from the fact\n\n\n-----\n\nresearchers whether some of the links observed were\n\ncommercial Internet connections via satellite, purchased\n\nby the attackers, or if the attackers had breached the ISPs\n\nand performed Man­in­the­Middle (MitM) attacks at the\n\nrouter level to hijack the stream. We have analyzed these\n\nmechanisms and come to the astonishing conclusion that\n\nthe method used by the Turla group is incredibly simple\n\nand straightforward, as well as highly anonymous and\n\nvery cheap to operate and manage.\n\n## Real satellite links, MitM attacks or BGP hĳacking?\n\nPurchasing satellite­based Internet links is one of the\n\noptions APT groups can choose to secure their C&C\n\ntraffic. However, full duplex satellite links can be very\n\nexpensive: a simple duplex 1Mbit up/down satellite link\n\nmay cost up to $7000 per week. For longer term contracts\n\nthis cost may decrease considerably, but the bandwidth\n\nstill remains very expensive.\n\nAnother way of getting a C&C server into a satellite’s IP\n\nrange is to hijack the network traffic between the victim\n\nand the satellite operator and to inject packets along the\n\nway. This requires either exploitation of the satellite\n\nprovider itself, or of another ISP on the way.\n\nThese kinds of hijacking attacks have been observed in\n\nthe past and were documented by Renesys (now part of\n\nDyn) in a blogpost dated November 2013.\n\nAccording to Renesys: “Various providers’ BGP routes\n\n_were hijacked, and as a result a portion of their Internet_\n\n_traffic was misdirected to flow through Belarusian and_\n\n_Icelandic ISPs. We have BGP routing data that show the_\n\n_second­by­second evolution of 21 Belarusian events in_\n\n_February and May 2013, and 17 Icelandic events in July­_\n\n_August 2013.”_\n\n[In a more recent blogpost from 2015 Dyn researchers](http://research.dyn.com/2015/01/vast-world-of-fraudulent-routing/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_is important to appreciate that the IP addresses identified_\n\n_as the source of incidents can and are regularly spoofed._\n\n_For example, an attack that appeared to come from a_\n\n_Comcast IP located in New Jersey may really have been_\n\n_from a hijacker located in Eastern Europe, briefly_\n\n_commandeering Comcast IP space. It is interesting to note_\n\n_that all six cases discussed above were conducted from_\n\n_either Europe or Russia.”_\n\nObviously, such incredibly apparent and large­scale\n\nattacks have little chance of surviving for long periods of\n\ntime, which is one of the key requirements for running an\n\nAPT operation. It is therefore not very feasible to perform\n\nthe attack through MitM traffic hijacking, unless the\n\nattackers have direct control over some high­traffic\n\nnetwork points, such as backbone routers or fiber optics.\n\nThere are signs that such attacks are becoming more\n\ncommon, but there is a much simpler way to hijack\n\nsatellite­based Internet traffic.\n\n## Satellite link (DVB-S) hĳacking\n\nThe hijacking of satellite DVB­S links has been described\n\na few times in the past and a presentation on hijacking\n\nsatellite DVB links was delivered at BlackHat 2010 by the\n\n\n-----\n\nTo hijack satellite DVB­S links, one needs the following:\n\nA satellite dish – the size depends on geographical\n\nposition and satellite\n\nA low­noise block downconverter (LNB)\n\nA dedicated DVB­S tuner (PCIe card)\n\nA PC, preferably running Linux\n\nWhile the dish and the LNB are more­or­less standard, the\n\ncard is perhaps the most important component. Currently,\n\nthe best DVB­S cards are made by a company called TBS\n\n[Technologies. The TBS­6922SE is perhaps the best entry­](http://www.tbsdtv.com/products/tbs6922se-dvb-s2-tv-tuner-pcie-card.html)\n\nlevel card for the task.\n\n**_TBS­6922SE PCIe card for receiving DVB­S channels_**\n\nThe TBS card is particularly well­suited to this task\n\nbecause it has dedicated Linux kernel drivers and\n\nsupports a function known as a brute­force scan which\n\nallows wide­frequency ranges to be tested for interesting\n\nsignals. Of course, other PCI or PCIe cards might work as\n\nwell, while, in general the USB­based cards are relatively\n\npoor and should be avoided.\n\nUnlike full duplex satellite­based Internet, the\n\ndownstream­only Internet links are used to accelerate\n\nInternet downloads and are very cheap and easy to\n\ndeploy. They are also inherently insecure and use no\n\nti t bf t th t ffi Thi t th\n\n\n-----\n\nCompanies that provide downstream­only Internet access\n\nuse teleport points to beam the traffic up to the satellite.\n\nThe satellite broadcasts the traffic to larger areas on the\n\nground, in the Ku band (12­18Ghz) by routing certain IP\n\nclasses through the teleport points.\n\n## How does satellite internet hĳacking work?\n\nTo attack satellite­based Internet connections, both the\n\nlegitimate users of these links as well as the attackers’\n\nown satellite dishes point to the specific satellite that is\n\nbroadcasting the traffic. The attackers abuse the fact that\n\nthe packets are unencrypted. Once an IP address that is\n\nrouted through the satellite’s downstream link is identified,\n\nthe attackers start listening for packets coming from the\n\nInternet to this specific IP. When such a packet is\n\nidentified, for instance a TCP/IP SYN packet, they identify\n\nthe source and spoof a reply packet (e.g. SYN ACK) back\n\nto the source using a conventional Internet line.\n\nAt the same time, the legitimate user of the link just\n\nignores the packet as it goes to an otherwise unopened\n\nport, for instance, port 80 or 10080. There is an important\n\nobservation to make here: normally, if a packet hits a\n\nclosed port, a RST or FIN packet will be sent back to the\n\nsource to indicate that there is nothing expecting the\n\npacket. However, for slow links, firewalls are\n\nrecommended and used to simply DROP packets to\n\n\n-----\n\n## Abused Internet ranges\n\nDuring the analysis, we observed the Turla attackers\n\nabusing several satellite DVB­S Internet providers, most of\n\nthem offering downstream­only connections in the Middle\n\nEast and Africa. Interestingly, the coverage of these\n\nbeams does not include Europe or Asia, meaning that a\n\ndish is required in either the Middle East or Africa.\n\nAlternatively, a much larger dish (3m+) can be used in\n\nother areas to boost the signal.\n\nTo calculate the dish size, one can use various tools,\n\nincluding online resources such as satbeams.com:\n\n**_Sample dish calculation – (c) www.satbeams.com_**\n\nThe table below shows some of the command­and­control\n\nservers related to the Turla actor with domains resolving\n\nto an IP belonging to satellite­based Internet providers:\n\n**IP** **First seen** **Hosts**\n\n84.11.79.6 Nov, 2007 n/a, see note below\n\n\nFeb 25th,\n92.62.218.99\n\n2014\n\nFeb 27th,\n209.239.79.47\n\n2014\n\n\npressforum.serveblog.net\n\nmusic­world.servemp3.com\n\npressforum.serveblog.net\n\nmusic­world.servemp3.com\n\n\nMarch\n209.239.79.52 hockey­news.servehttp.com\n\n\n-----\n\n18th, 2014\n\nJanuary\n209.239.79.33\n\n25th, 2014 [eu­society.com]\n\ncars­online.zapto.org\n\nfifa­rules.25u.com\n\nforum.sytes.net\n\nhealth­everyday.faqserv.com\n\n\nMarch\n92.62.220.170\n\n19th, 2014\n\n\nmusic­world.servemp3.com\n\nnhl­blog.servegame.com\n\nolympik­blog.4dq.com\n\nsupernews.sytes.net\n\ntiger.got­game.org\n\ntop­facts.sytes.net\n\nx­files.zapto.org\n\n\nApril 26th,\n92.62.219.172 eu­society.com\n\n2013\n\n\nMay 28th,\n82.146.174.58\n\n2014\n\n\nforum.sytes.net\n\nhockey­news.servehttp.com\n\nleagueoflegends.servequake.com\n\nmusic­world.servemp3.com\n\n\nMarch\n82.146.166.56\n\n11th, 2014 [easport­news.publicvm.com]\n\nJune 24th,\n82.146.166.62 hockey­news.servehttp.com\n\n2014\n\n\n62.243.189.231 [April 4th,]\n\n2014\n\n\nafricankingdom.deaftone.com\n\naromatravel.org\n\nmarketplace.servehttp.com\n\nnewutils.3utilities.com\n\npeople­health.net\n\npressforum.serveblog.net\n\nweather­online.hopto.org\n\n\nMarch\n77.246.76.19\n\n17th, 2015 [onlineshop.sellclassics.com]\n\n62.243.189.187 [May 2nd,] eu­society.com\n\n2012\n\n\n62.243.189.215 [January] people­health.net\n\n3rd, 2013\n\n\nJuly 3,\n217.20.243.37\n\n2014\n\nSeptember\n\n\nforum.sytes.net\n\nmusic­world.servemp3.com\n\n\n-----\n\nAugust 05,\n83.229.75.141\n\n2015\n\n\naccessdest.strangled.net\n\nchinafood.chickenkiller.com\n\ncoldriver.strangled.net\n\ndeveloparea.mooo.com\n\ndowntown.crabdance.com\n\ngreateplan.ocry.com\n\nindustrywork.mooo.com\n\nradiobutton.mooo.com\n\nsecuresource.strangled.net\n\nsportnewspaper.strangled.net\n\nsupercar.ignorelist.com\n\nsupernews.instanthq.com\n\n\n_Note: 84.11.79.6 is hardcoded in the configuration block of_\n\n_the malicious sample._\n\nThe observed satellite IPs have the following ‘WHOIS’\n\ninformation:\n\n**IP** **Country** **ISP**\n\n\n92.62.220.170\n\n92.62.219.172\n\n92.62.218.99\n\n209.239.79.47\n\n209.239.79.52\n\n209.239.79.152\n\n209.239.79.33\n\n82.146.174.58\n\n82.146.166.56\n\n82.146.166.62\n\n62.243.189.231\n\n62.243.189.187\n\n62.243.189.215\n\n\nNigeria\n\nUAE\n\n\nSkylinks\n\nSatellite\n\nCommunications\n\nLimited\n\nTeleskies,\n\nTelesat Network\n\nServices Inc\n\n\nLebanon Lunasat Isp\n\nDenmark Emperion\n\n\n77.246.71.10 Intrasky\n\nLebanon\n77.246.76.19 Offshore S.a.l.\n\n84.11.79.6 Germany IABG mbH\n\n\nSky Power\n217.20.243.37 Somalia\n\nInternational Ltd\n\n\n-----\n\nUnited\n83.229.75.141\n\nKingdom\n\n217.194.150.31 Niger\n\n\nSkyVision\n\nGlobal Networks\n\nLtd\n\nSkyVision\n\nGlobal Networks\n\nLtd\n\n\n41.190.233.29 Congo Orioncom\n\nOne interesting case is probably 84.11.79.6, which falls\n\ninto the satellite IP range of IABG mbH.\n\nThis IP is encrypted in the C&C of the following backdoor\n\n[used by Turla group, known as “Agent.DNE“:](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7d5d7a372d6b4b48640fae95238ee74b99be35d8e64b4de5bde8d8d140c91d7c/analysis/1430803399/)\n\nmd5 0328dedfce54e185ad395ac44aa4223c\n\nsize 91136 bytes\n\ntype Windows PE\n\n**_Agent.DNE C&C configuration_**\n\nThis Agent.DNE sample has a compilation timestamp of\n\nThu Nov 22 14:34:15 2007, meaning that the Turla group\n\nhas been using satellite­based Internet links for almost\n\neight years.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe regular usage of satellite­based Internet links by the\n\nTurla group represents an interesting aspect of their\n\n\n-----\n\noperational security limitations self­imposed by the group\n\nor because of shutdown by other parties due to malicious\n\nbehavior.\n\nThe technical method used to implement these Internet\n\ncircuits relies on hijacking downstream bandwidth from\n\nvarious ISPs and packet­spoofing. This is a method that is\n\ntechnically easy to implement, and provides a much\n\nhigher degree of anonymity than possibly any other\n\nconventional method such as renting a VPS or hacking a\n\nlegitimate server.\n\nTo implement this attack methodology, the initial\n\ninvestment is less than $1000. Regular maintenance\n\nshould be less than $1000 per year. Considering how\n\neasy and cheap this method is, it is surprising that we\n\nhave not seen more APT groups using it. Even though this\n\nmethod provides an unmatched level of anonymfor\n\nlogistical reasons it is more straightforward to rely on\n\nbullet­proof hosting, multiple proxy levels or hacked\n\nwebsites. In truth, the Turla group has been known to use\n\nall of these techniques, making it a very versatile, dynamic\n\nand flexible cyber­espionage operation.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that Turla is not the only APT\n\ngroup that has used satellite­based Internet links.\n\nHackingTeam C&Cs were seen on satellite IPs before, as\n\nwell as C&Cs from the Xumuxu group and, more recently\n\nthe Rocket Kitten APT group.\n\nIf this method becomes widespread between APT groups\n\nor worse, cyber­criminal groups, this will pose a serious\n\nproblem for the IT security and counter­intelligence\n\ncommunities.\n\n_* A full paper on the Turla group’s use of satellite­based Internet_\n\n_links is available to the customers of Kaspersky Intelligence_\n\n_Services._\n\n## Indicators of compromise:\n\n\n-----\n\n84.11.79.6\n\n41.190.233.29\n\n62.243.189.187\n\n62.243.189.215\n\n62.243.189.231\n\n77.246.71.10\n\n77.246.76.19\n\n77.73.187.223\n\n82.146.166.56\n\n82.146.166.62\n\n82.146.174.58\n\n83.229.75.141\n\n92.62.218.99\n\n92.62.219.172\n\n92.62.220.170\n\n92.62.221.30\n\n92.62.221.38\n\n209.239.79.121\n\n209.239.79.125\n\n209.239.79.15\n\n209.239.79.152\n\n209.239.79.33\n\n209.239.79.35\n\n209.239.79.47\n\n209.239.79.52\n\n209.239.79.55\n\n209.239.79.69\n\n209.239.82.7\n\n209.239.85.240\n\n209.239.89.100\n\n217.194.150.31\n\n217.20.242.22\n\n217.20.243.37\n\n#### Hostnames:\n\naccessdest.strangled[.]net\n\nbookstore.strangled[.]net\n\nbug.ignorelist[.]com\n\ncars­online.zapto[.]org\n\nchinafood chickenkiller[ ]com\n\n\n-----\n\ndeveloparea.mooo[.]com\n\ndowntown.crabdance[.]com\n\neasport­news.publicvm[.]com\n\neurovision.chickenkiller[.]com\n\nfifa­rules.25u[.]com\n\nforum.sytes[.]net\n\ngoldenroade.strangled[.]net\n\ngreateplan.ocry[.]com\n\nhealth­everyday.faqserv[.]com\n\nhighhills.ignorelist[.]com\n\nhockey­news.servehttp[.]com\n\nindustrywork.mooo[.]com\n\nleagueoflegends.servequake[.]com\n\nmarketplace.servehttp[.]com\n\nmediahistory.linkpc[.]net\n\nmusic­world.servemp3[.]com\n\nnew­book.linkpc[.]net\n\nnewgame.2waky[.]com\n\nnewutils.3utilities[.]com\n\nnhl­blog.servegame[.]com\n\nnightstreet.toh[.]info\n\nolympik­blog.4dq[.]com\n\nonlineshop.sellclassics[.]com\n\npressforum.serveblog[.]net\n\nradiobutton.mooo[.]com\n\nsealand.publicvm[.]com\n\nsecuresource.strangled[.]net\n\nsoftstream.strangled[.]net\n\nsportacademy.my03[.]com\n\nsportnewspaper.strangled[.]net\n\nsupercar.ignorelist[.]com\n\nsupernews.instanthq[.]com\n\nsupernews.sytes[.]net\n\ntelesport.mooo[.]com\n\ntiger.got­game[.]org\n\ntop­facts.sytes[.]net\n\ntrack.strangled[.]net\n\nwargame.ignorelist[.]com\n\nweather­online.hopto[.]org\n\nwintersport.mrbasic[.]com\n\nx­files.zapto[.]org\n\n\n-----\n\n0328dedfce54e185ad395ac44aa4223c\n\n18da7eea4e8a862a19c8c4f10d7341c0\n\n2a7670aa9d1cc64e61fd50f9f64296f9\n\n49d6cf436aa7bc5314aa4e78608872d8\n\na44ee30f9f14e156ac0c2137af595cf7\n\nb0a1301bc25cfbe66afe596272f56475\n\nbcfee2fb5dbc111bfa892ff9e19e45c1\n\nd6211fec96c60114d41ec83874a1b31d\n\ne29a3cc864d943f0e3ede404a32f4189\n\nf5916f8f004ffb85e93b4d205576a247\n\n594cb9523e32a5bbf4eb1c491f06d4f9\n\nd5bd7211332d31dcead4bfb07b288473\n\n#### Kaspersky Lab products detect the above Turla samples with the following verdicts:\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Turla.cd\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Turla.ce\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Turla.cl\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Turla.ch\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Turla.cj\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Turla.ck\n\nTrojan.Win32.Agent.dne\n\n## References:\n\n1.

When such a packet is\n\nidentified, for instance a TCP/IP SYN packet, they identify the\n\nsource and spoof a reply packet (e.g. SYN ACK) back to the source\n\nusing a conventional Internet line.\n\nSay, Alice is the ordinary/legitimate subscriber, Bob sends this SYN\n\npacket to her, which is also received by Mallory, and Mallory sends\n\nthe SYN/ACK. If Bob sends this SYN packet, he probably expects\n\nAlice to send the SYN/ACK, which she does. So, both Alice and\n\nMallory send a SYN/ACK. What is Mallory supposed to gain from\n\nthis?\n\n- At the same time, the legitimate user of the link just ignores the\n\n\n[Reply](https://securelist.com/blog/research/72081/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/?replytocom=585306#respond)\n\n\n-----\n\nHuh? Bob opened that connection, so he certainly does not ignore\n\npackets. Alice responds to a SYN packet, so she does not ignore\n\neither. The port observed by Mallory quite likely is *not* unopened.\n\nInstead, if I were Mallory, I would do the following: I see that Alice is\n\na satellite subscriber and learn her IP address. Thus, I can send\n\nTCP SYN to Port 80 on her IP address. If she does not run a web\n\nserver and is behind a firewall, I won’t receive a reply. Thus, I can\n\nuse her IP address and port 80 for my own server. (In fact, I can\n\nport scan on her; if she drops any SYN packet I can use that port\n\ninstead of 80.) Packets will be delivered to her and me, she (or her\n\nfirewall) throws away the packets, so my own connection will be\n\nstable.\n\nI’d like to point out the lesson to be learned here: If you are on a\n\nbroadcast network, send your RST packets. Otherwise, everyone is\n\nfree to hide under your IP address.\n\n(Besides, if there are unassigned IP addresses, Mallory might just\n\nuse one of those—if they are routed by the satellite network’s\n\noperator, although they are unassigned.)\n\n\n[Reply](https://securelist.com/blog/research/72081/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/?replytocom=587144#respond)\n\n\n-----",
