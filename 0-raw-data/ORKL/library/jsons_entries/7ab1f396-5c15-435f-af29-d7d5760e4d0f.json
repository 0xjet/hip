This article has been updated with the**\n**analysis of the attack on Globant, which came to light on 30 March 2022.**\n[CloudSEK’s flagship digital risk monitoring platform XVigil discovered a post on Telegram, sharing the Nvidia employee credentials,](https://cloudsek.com/)\nSamsung’s Source code along with that the latest addition to those already high profile targets are Microsoft’s Cortana and Bing’s Source\ncode and Okta the SSO giant’s customer data was exfiltrated.\n\n\n-----\n\napsus$ a so a e ga g c a ed to a e co p o sed d a a d o ta gets Sa su g t t e b eac u t e c a g to a e\ngained access to source code used in Samsung Galaxy smartphones, Okta’s Customer data etc.\nThe ransomware gang leaked source code, dehashed credentials, code signing certificates and source code to the driver. The leaked\ndata unlocks the potential for threat actors to gain unauthorized access to personal, proprietary, and Intellectual Property (IP) data of\nNvidia and they have also leaked 90% source code of Bing Maps, Bing and Cortana claiming to be at 45%.\nWhile writing this report, we have discovered that PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or dox Information related to the Lapsus$\nransomware gang was released at a Russian language cybercrime forum.\n\n_This screenshot was posted on the telegram group and while analyzing closely we can see that they have access to Jira, Slack, G-Suite and_\n_other internal applications as well. RDP access is being used in the screenshot_\n\n## Analysis and Attribution\n\n**Information from the Telegram**\n\nOn 22nd March, 2022 the group claimed to leak Bing Maps, Bing and Cortana source code. Our threat Intelligence team has confirmed that\n[these claims are true, shortly after there were official blogs from Microsoft and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction/) [Okta confirming the breach.](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/03/updated-okta-statement-on-lapsus/)\n\n_Leaked Information shared on Telegram Channels_\n\n**Original Perpetrators of Breach**\n\nThe LAPSUS$ cyber-criminal group has been known to exploit the weakest link in the security chain of a corporate network: Human mistakes\n**and bad practices.**\n\n**They achieve initial access using the following tactics:**\n\n[Redline Malware stealer logs, which can be understood here](https://www.xvigil.com/underground-intelligence/details?identifier=Z2xvYmFsLXRocmVhdC1pbnRlbCN5ZUktVDM4QkExVjVOUGVqYzFxRA&nav_search=WyJjYXRlZ29yeT0xJnNlYXJjaD1yZWRsaW5lJnBhZ2U9Z3RpX2xpc3QmaW5kZXhfbm89MCJd)\n\n\n-----\n\nopu a a et p aces e a gos, uss a a et to get ogs, c ede t a s a d sess o to e s to get access\nThey are known to pay insiders to provide them with VPN, VDI(citrix), Identity providers and even RDP access\n\nLapsus Recruitment Post\n\nPublicly available secrets on github/gitlab repositories\n\n**The next steps involve Privilege escalation and Post Exploitation:**\n\nExploiting existing vulnerabilities which include unpatched versions of Jira, confluence, Fortiguard, Microsoft exchange servers etc.. We\nhave created a list of curated vulnerabilities that they target\nAccessing version control systems and looking at private repositories to gain access to secrets and gems\nThey also access mailboxes/collaboration software like slack to get access to credentials being shared in plain text.\n\n_They have highlighted the post-exploitation steps they took as a part of the_\n\n_response to Okta’s latest blog._\n\n**Microsoft Leak Analysis:**\n\nMicrosoft in an official blog today has stated the following:\n```\n“This week, the actor made public claims that they had gained access to Microsoft and exfiltrated portions of source code. No\ncustomer code or data was involved in the observed activities. Our investigation has found a single account had been compromised,\ngranting limited access. Our cybersecurity response teams quickly engaged to remediate the compromised account and prevent further\nactivity. Microsoft does not rely on the secrecy of code as a security measure and viewing source code does not lead to elevation\nof risk.”\n\n```\nThe leak contains 56484 directories, 333743 files and the source code for Cortana, Bing Maps and Bing. The aggregate size of the data\nleaked is 37.8 GB.\n\nThe leak also contains multiple sensitive endpoints like the one mentioned in the above screenshot. Similarly there are 135 .pfx files which are\npresent in the leak A pfx file contains the SSL certificate(public key) and the corresponding private key These can in turn be used maliciously\n\n\n-----\n\ne e a e docu e tat o es as e as te a pd es\n\nBy looking at the files we can conclude the following:\n\nNo customer data was affected\nNo PII was leaked\nSource code along with certificates and pfx files were leaked\nThe Lapsus$ group is not very strong with Operational Security as they posted a Proof of Concept in the Telegram channel while the\nexfiltration was still underway\n\n**Okta Breach Analysis:**\n\nOkta has also released a statement earlier in the form of a blog stating:\n```\n“Okta detected an unsuccessful attempt to compromise the account of a customer support engineer working for a third-party provider.\nAs part of our regular procedures, we alerted the provider to the situation, while simultaneously terminating the user’s active\nOkta sessions and suspending the individual’s account. Following those actions, we shared pertinent information (including\nsuspicious IP addresses) to supplement their investigation, which was supported by a third-party forensics firm.”\n“After a thorough analysis of these claims, we have concluded that a small percentage of customers – approximately 2.5% – have\npotentially been impacted and whose data may have been viewed or acted upon. We have identified those customers and are contacting\nthem directly. If you are an Okta customer and were impacted, we have already reached out directly by email. We are sharing this\ninterim update, consistent with our values of customer success, integrity, and transparency”\n\n```\nIn response to the above statement, Lapsus$ group has also released a message which can be summarized in the following points:\n\nThey were successful in breaching a Superuser/Admin account that had access to Slack, Jira, Confluence boards etc ..\n\n\n-----\n\nt s susp c ous t at t e custo e suppo t e g ee ad access to 8 6 s ac c a e s a d te a app cat o s\nThey had access to internal AWS secret and key pairs/ other API keys as they were being shared in plain text over Slack and emails\nThe breached account had the ability to reset the Password and MFA of ~95% of their clientele\n\n_The screenshot was shared by Lapsus as a POC claiming they had access to Slack and other applications._\n\n**Globant Leak Analysis:**\n\nGlobant in an official confirmation has not contested the claim of Lapsus$. Globant released the following statement:\n\n“We have recently detected that a limited section of our company’s code repository has been subject to unauthorized access. We have\nactivated our security protocols and are conducting an exhaustive investigation. According to our current analysis, the information that was\naccessed was limited to certain source code and project-related documentation for a very limited number of clients. To date, we have not found\nany evidence that other areas of our infrastructure systems or those of our clients were affected”\n\nThe 70 GB data leak contains public and private keys (SSH and SSL) present in the leak asa part of their source code. It consists of the\nfollowing information for a number of their clients:\n\n\n-----\n\nCredential files leaked:\n\nSensitive information and PII leaked:\n\nSQL files leaked:\n\n**Information from the Cyber Crime forum**\n\nLapsus Ransomware group emerged in early January 2022.\n\nThe group is actively operating over their Telegram channel and engages with subscribers. They keep their subscribers updated on their\nupcoming data breaches and host polls.\nRecently, we came across a post on a Russian speaking cybercrime forum that mentioned PII as the operator of the Lapsus$ group.\n\n\n-----\n\ne do ed o at o s o s a ot o pe so a o at o\nName: Arion Kurtaj\nInterests: Minecraft, Fishing, selling 0days\nAge: 16 years\nPotential Address: Spain\nNationality: British\nDOB: February 19th, 2005\nPersonal Emails:\n\n[[email protected],](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6f0e0108030601080b061d0a0c1b2f1f1d001b0001020e0603410c0002) [[email protected],](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c1e0e191d1f141e1d0f193c0c0e13081312111d1510521f1311) [[email protected],](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4622293e242f28312e2f3223063634293229282b272f2a6825292b) [[email protected],](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea8b98838584819f989e8b809e8b88aa8d878b8386c4898587) [[email protected],](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fb9a89929495908e898f9a919c9a9692959cbb948e8f97949490d5989496) [[email protected],](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea8b98838584819f989e8b809a8285848faa8d878b8386c4898587) [[email protected],](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7b6a5beb8b9bca2a5a3b6bde4e5e697b0bab6bebbf9b4b8ba)\n\n[[email protected],](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0362716a6c6d687671776269323a333143646e626a6f2d606c6e) [[email protected]](https://cloudsek.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a6b78636564617f787e6b60657d646b6d6f6265797e63646d4a6d676b636624696567)\n\nAliases:\n\n## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE)\n\nLapsus$ gang previously targeted an organization in Nepal and an investigation blog was published for the same mentioning the targeted\nCVEs.\n\n**CVEs targeted by Lapsus$**\n\nCVE-2022-21702: XSS vulnerability in Grafana CVE-2022-0510: XSS reflected in Packagist pimcore/pimcore\nprior to 10.3.1.\n\n\nCVE-2022-0139: Use After Free in GitHub repository radareorg/radare2\nprior to 5.6.0\n\nCVE-2021-45327: Trusting HTTP Permission Methods on the Server\nSide when referencing the vulnerable admin or user API\n\nCVE-2021-45325: SSRF vulneraility exists in Gitea before 1.7.0 using\nthe OpenID URL\n\nCVE-2021-44956: Two Heap based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in\nffjpeg through 01.01.2021\n\nCVE-2021-34473: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability\n\nCVE-2021-26858: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability\n\nCVE-2021-26855: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability\n\nCVE-2020-23705: A global buffer overflow vulnerability through 2020-0622\n\n\nCVE-2021-45328: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (‘Open\nRedirect’) via internal URLs\n\nCVE-2021-45326: CSRF vulnerability exists in Gitea before\n1.5.2 via API routes\n\nCVE-2021-44957: Global buffer overflow vulnerability exist in\nffjpeg through 01.01.2021\n\nCVE-2021-44864: TP-Link WR886N 3.0 1.0.1 Build 150127\nRel.34123n is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow\n\nCVE-2021-31207: Microsoft Exchange Server Security Feature\nBypass Vulnerability\n\nCVE-2021-26857: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code\nExecution Vulnerability\n\nCVE-2020-23852: A heap based buffer overflow vulnerability\nexists in ffjpeg through 2020-07-02\n\nCVE-2020-12812: An improper authentication vulnerability in\nSSL VPN in FortiOS\n\n\nCVE-2019-5591: A Default Configuration vulnerability in FortiOS CVE-2018-13379: An Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a\nRestricted Directory (“Path Traversal”) in Fortinet\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nNvidia was targeted by Lapsus$ group last month.
