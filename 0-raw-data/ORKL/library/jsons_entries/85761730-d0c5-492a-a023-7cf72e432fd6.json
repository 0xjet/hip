Ranging from\n\ndenial of service attacks to backdoor-implanting espionage to attempts to bring down critical\n\ninfrastructure, these computer network attacks fill a spectrum from juvenile on one end to dire on\n\nthe other. Having failed to field an effective comprehensive computer network defense strategy,\n\nsome have suggested that the U.S. establish a doctrine of cyber-deterrence as a core component\n\nof such a strategy. Determining the feasibility of cyberdeterrence is of critical importance as the\n\nU.S. prepares to establish a new military command, U.S. Cyber Command, which would be\n\nresponsible for carrying out such a doctrine. This doctrine would vow proportional and\n\nmeasured cyber attacks against nations attacking U.S. network infrastructure in order to deter\n\nattacks from taking place.[1] However, cyber warfare, unlike the nuclear warfare dynamic that\n\ngave birth to our contemporary understanding of deterrence, is dissimilar in ways that make\n\ndeterrence a difficult policy and a broader deterrence strategy one potentially destined to fail.\n\nThe core problem of cyber warfare is the problem of attribution. Cyber attacks are not\n\neasily attributed. Attackers can hide in the cloud. Determined combatants can disguise\n\nthemselves as other actors. Conducted properly, the victim never knows the attack is occurring\n\nand may be lucky to discover it years after the fact. Complicating this further, attacks directed\n\nby states need not be conducted by states. Some victims, presented with evidence of attribution,\n\nmay not wish to acknowledge attacks for political reasons. In analyzing a series of significant\n\n1 Alexander, Keith. \"Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, USA, Nominee for Commander,\nUnited States Cyber Command.\" Senate Armed Services Committee. 14 April 2010.\n(http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/questions.pdf). 15 April 2010.\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\ncontemporary cases of cyber attacks, I will show that attribution at a degree required by a\n\ndeterrence policy is so difficult that a deterrence strategy is ipso facto infeasible.\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n**DETERRENCE**\n\nDeterrence strategy is a framework under which the deterring state, under threat of pain,\n\ndemands that the deterred state does _not conduct a specific, overt action. Deterrence is_\n\nfundamentally about the maintenance of the status quo on the part of the deterring state, designed\n\nto maintain a specific condition under threat of change by the deterred party. The setting of\n\ndemands by the deterring state is generally non-provocative—it consists of, as Thomas Schelling\n\nexplains, setting the stage and waiting; in contrast, overt actions on the part of the deterred state\n\nto violate those demands are viewed as provocative.[2] Primary to the value of deterrence is the\n\nrealization that violence is best utilized when it is threatened but not used, as Schelling\n\nidentifies.[3] This contrasts with the employment of brute force.\n\nThe mechanics of deterrence have been likened to a ―trip wire‖ or ―plate-glass window,‖\n\nas Schelling identifies in his discussion of U.S. troops in Berlin as an empirical example.[4] In this\n\nsituation, the deterrence calculus identifies the troops as a ―trip wire‖ that, if attacked by the\n\nSoviets or their satellites, would trigger a massive military response on the part of NATO. To\n\nincrease the robustness of the deterrent threat, a deterrent state can engage in a _commitment_\n\n_process under which it eliminates possible situations that may give it avenues to avoid enforcing_\n\nits deterrence strategy demands upon the deterred state, all in an attempt to make the deterrent\n\nthreat more credible.[5] Schelling uses the example of Quemoy, but perhaps a better example\n\nwould be the ―doomsday machine‖ from the nuclear deterrence satire _Dr. Strangelove. By_\n\nautomating the processes of this machine so that no human could interrupt and prevent universal\n\nglobal atomic holocaust in the event of an attack on the Soviet Union, the Soviets had achieved\n\n2 Schelling, Thomas. Arms and Influence. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1966.  Pages 71-72\n3 _Ibid.,  Page 10_\n4 _Ibid.,  Page 47_\n5 _Ibid.,  Page 44_\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\nthe perfect deterrent by _committing themselves to mandatory enforcement of their threat. Of_\n\ncourse, this highlights an obvious issue with deterrence in general, that the deterrent threat has to\n\nbe communicated to the enemy and properly understood; an unknown or misinterpreted deterrent\n\nis not a deterrent.\n\nDeterrence is not without its shortcomings. One well-discussed impediment to effective\n\ndeterrence is the utilization of _salami tactics, an attempt by the deterred state to progressively_\n\nand in small steps come close to and or actually violate the demands of the deterring state in a\n\nway that prevents the deterrent from being employed.[6] A recent example of salami tactics can be\n\nseen in the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. While Israel made clear to Hezbollah\n\nthat it would not tolerate rocket fire on its population centers and the kidnapping of its soldiers,\n\nHezbollah periodically did both, growing bolder with each operation. The Israeli deterrent was\n\nnot used after the first harassing Hezbollah events, reducing its power and credibility. Hassan\n\nNasrallah stated as such when Israel finally invaded in July 2006 after another provocation; he\n\nhad no expectation of an Israeli response[7], showing that he had no faith in Israel‘s threat. As\n\nSchelling identified, to be effective the threat has to be credible.[8] The deterring party has to\n\nthreaten that it will act to prove its commitment; may act is not sufficient.[9]\n\nAbsent from much of the Cold War deterrence literature is the discussion of attribution.\n\nMost writers during this period examined deterrence in the U.S.-Russia framework. Attacks, be\n\nthey conventional or nuclear, were always assumed to be attributable. Either the U.S. launched\n\nballistic missiles first or the Soviets did. There were no immediate concerns that rogue,\n\n6 _Ibid.,  Page 66_\n7 Noe, Nicholas, ed., Voice of Hezbollah: the Statements of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. London: Verso, 2007\n\n8 Schelling, Thomas. The Strategy of Conflict. New York: Oxford University Press, 1960. Page 6\n9 _Ibid., Page 187_\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\nunattributed ICBMs would start raining down upon America. Attribution was so integral to the\n\nanalysis of deterrence as a strategy that it was hardly worth a mention.\n\nThis issue of attribution, so clear in the Cold War context, becomes muddy and complex\n\nwhen applied to the realm of cyber warfare. Take a simple policy statement, for example: the\n\nUnited States will respond with a massive cyber-offensive against China and its interests in the\n\nevent of a Chinese attack on the United States or its interests, sufficient in scale as to deter China\n\nfrom conducting such an attack. Chinese long-range bombers would be detectable flying over\n\nthe Pacific, as would ICBMs as they hurtle through space towards San Francisco. But packets\n\nstreaming through an undersea fiber optic cable landing at a terrestrial fiber backbone switching\n\ncenter in Los Angeles, destined to cripple American defenses, power production, or early\nwarning radar, would in all likelihood be undetectable. At that moment a prospective American\n\ncyber-deterrence strategy would be impotent. Deaf, dumb, and blind, the U.S. government\n\nwould know it had been attacked—but by whom? Who would the U.S. strike back against in\n\nrighteous anger?\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n**CYBER ATTACKS AND ATTRIBUTION – CASE STUDY**\n\nTo illustrate the problem of attribution, I will analyze five contemporary ―cyber attacks,‖\n\nbroadly defined. This basket of cases will include attacks against both government and civilian\n\ninfrastructure as well as a variety of attack methods ranging from denial of service attacks to\n\npotentially crippling sabotage of critical infrastructure. In each case I will explore a series of\n\nquestions:\n\n  - Who attributed the attack?\n\n  - At what confidence was the attack attributed?\n\n  - How was the attack attributed?\n\n  - How long of a delay was there between attack and attribution?\n\n  - What was the response of the attack‘s victim?\n\nThis set of cases will show the difficulties of attribution of cyber attacks, especially\n\nhighlighting the uncomfortably circumstantial nature of cyber-attribution. Throughout these\n\ncases, attribution will be shown often to be technically infeasible, politically undesirable, and in\n\nsome cases, both. Due to the lack of published reports of cyber warfare, several of the cases I\n\nexamine will not be especially consequential, particularly when presented to a U.S. audience.\n\nThe cases available for analysis are few, and those that exist are poorly sourced. But the lessons\n\nlearned in these cases I examine are universal, no matter how trivial or significant the\n\nconsequences of the attacks.\n\n**_ESTONIAN CYBER WAR_**\n\nOn 27 April 2007, the Estonian government relocated a Soviet-era World War II\n\nmemorial. A lightning rod for the acrimonious division between ethnic Russian and Estonian\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nnationalist elements with Estonian society, its relocation triggered violence on the streets.[10] To\n\nmany Estonians and the Estonian government, the memorial was a reminder of Soviet occupation\n\nand oppression, while to pro-Russian elements it memorialized those who fought valiantly\n\nagainst the Nazis.  The move caught the attention of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who\n\ncondemned the move.[11]\n\nEstonia is more wired and utilizes the internet more than most countries. Online banking\n\nis extensive and in 2007 a fraction of the votes for parliament were conducted online.[12] As a\n\nresult of Estonia‘s greater cyber linkages, cyber attacks would have had a significant negative\n\nimpact.\n\nA few days before it began, Estonia realized that a cyber attack was coming. Postings on\n\nRussian-language web forums suggested that a major cyber effort was underway.[13] Estonia\n\nrefrained from publicly warning Russia as diplomatic efforts were underway to defuse the crisis.\n\nOn 26 April 2007 at 10:00 p.m. local time, distributed denial of service attacks began against a\n\nlist of Estonian websites.[14] Step-by-step instructions allowed any internet user to launch attacks\n\nof their own.[15] Public websites and mail servers for a variety of organizations suffered and\n\nbegan crashing. Supplementing manual efforts, unknown attack coordinators triggered botnets\n\nto begin attacking Estonia, drastically increasing the stream of packets targeting Estonian\n\n10 ―Estonia Blames Russia for Unrest.‖ BBC News. 29 April 2007.\n[(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6604647.stm). 15 February 2010.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6604647.stm)\n11 _Ibid._\n12 Evron, Gadi. ―Battling Botnets and Online Mobs.‖ Georgetown Journal of International Affairs.

The onslaught continued for over\n\nthree weeks while Russian authorities did nothing to stop or discourage the attacks. Attacks\n\npeaked on 9 May, which was Victory Day in Russia.[17] The political damage outweighed the\n\nactual damage caused by the attacks; slowing internet connections, taking down websites, and\n\ndefacing others were more of a nuisance than a threat.\n\nOn 17 May Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet directly blamed the Russian\n\ngovernment for direct involvement in the attacks, which he claimed targed Estonian government\n\nwebsites, telephone networks, and emergency response systems.[18] He also directly attributed the\n\nattacks to Russian government infrastructure, claiming that they came from IP addresses and\n\nservers assigned to the Russian government.[19] Though appealing for help against a perceived\n\nRussian government onslaught, Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that NATO‘s\n\ncollective defense Article V could not be invoked because ―not a single NATO defense minister\n\nwould define a cyber-attack as a clear military action at present.‖[20] The Estonian defense\n\nministry hinted that, in addition to blocking access to Estonian infrastructure from foreign IP\n\naddresses, ―people‖ started to fight against the cyber attack, claiming that ―ways were found to\n\neliminate the attacker.‖[21]\n\nOther knowledgeable analysts cast doubts on the veracity of Paet‘s claim.

This assumes that\n\nthe Russian government wanted to be identified as the culprit; in a cyber war, measured attacks\n\nby proxy deflect blame and attribution when both are unwanted.\n\nInterestingly, nearly two years later, a member of the Russian Duma, Sergei Markov,\n\nexplained a possible government hand in the attacks. He claimed that an unnamed assistant of\n\nhis coordinated the attacks while residing in one of Russia‘s ―unrecognized republics,‖ possibly\n\nTransnistria.[24] While not explicitly coordinated by the Russian government, Markov admitted\n\nthat there was passive government support to what he described as ―purely a reaction from civil\n\nsociety‖ out of a sentiment that ―something bad had to be done to these fascists.‖[25]\n\nMarkov‘s assessment of the situation is the most plausible in retrospect: patriotic\n\nRussian hackers, with support of individuals acting in a non-governmental capacity but with\n\npassive encouragement from elements of the Russian government, banded together to attack with\n\ncriminally-sourced tools like Trojans and botnets. Not criminal, not state-driven, not\n\nnationalists, not pranksters, but rather a mix of them all were responsible for what has been\n\n22 Rantanen, Miska. ―Virtual Harassment, but for Real.‖ Helsingin Sanomat. 6 May 2007.\n[(http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Virtual+harassment+but+for+real+/1135227099868). 15 February 2010.](http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Virtual+harassment+but+for+real+/1135227099868)\n23 _Ibid._\n24 Coalson, Robert. ―Behind the Estonia Cyberattacks.‖ Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty. 6 March 2009.\n[(http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html). 15 February 2010.](http://www.rferl.org/Content/Behind_The_Estonia_Cyberattacks/1505613.html)\n25 _Ibid._\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\ntermed a ―cyber riot‖ rather than a cyber attack.[26] While information released by the Estonians\n\nand analysis by independent investigators suggested this was the case, it was not until this\n\nmoment 23 months later that attribution was this clear. Future victims of cyber attacks, however,\n\ncannot rely on the attacker claiming victory as the default method of attribution.\n\n**_MOONLIGHT MAZE_**\n\nLong before cyber warfare gained an elevated status and before a Department of Defense\n\ncyber command was a possibility, the Moonlight Maze intrusion set rattled the U.S. defense\n\nestablishment. In March 1998, back in a time when cyber warfare was referred to as ―netwar,‖\n\nthe U.S. government detected broad intrusions into defense networks, NASA, and other\n\ngovernment agencies. These intrusions, purported to be coming from Russia, were termed\n\nMoonlight Maze by the intelligence community.\n\nJames Adams, chairman of a cybersecurity firm and a member of the National Security\n\nAgency Advisory Board, made a splash in May 2001 when he announced the intelligence\n\ncommunity‘s Moonlight Maze investigation in Foreign Affairs.[27] Expanding upon the\n\nGovernment Accountability Office‘s brief mention of Moonlight Maze earlier that year, Adams\n\nclaimed that for three years the U.S. government was investigating actions by a ―group of\n\nhackers‖ targeting the Department of Defense, NASA, private universities, research labs, and\n\ngovernment agencies.[28] [29] Others specifically identified the Department of Defense‘s\n\nunclassified NIPRNET system as the biggest target.[30]\n\n26 James Hendler, as cited in Waterman, Shaun. ―Analysis: Who Cyber Smacked Estonia?‖ United Press\n[International. 11 June 2007.

Adams hinted that the grounds for future sabotage were laid and that many\n\nmore questions were left unresolved. Adams claims that the attacks appeared to come from\n\nRussian-registered IP addresses, but no definitive links to a state-sponsored effort could be\n\nfound. Dion Stempfley, a former analyst at the Pentagon who helped detect Moonlight Maze,\n\nsuggested that the attacks were ―state allowed,‖ in that the Russian government was either\n\ndirecting or knowingly permitting the attacks.[32] Attempts to ―hack-back‖ were limited because\n\nthe Pentagon was fearful of conducting an act of war in the even the attacks were coming from a\n\nstate program.[33] The Russian government was demarched on the issue and pleaded ignorance in\n\nthe face of evidence.\n\nMoonlight Maze was one of the first true cyber incidents to target the U.S. defense\n\nestablishment. No information has been made public regarding the timeline of attribution. First\n\ndetected in March 1998 by computer network analysts at the Department of Defense, Moonlight\n\nMaze may have been going on for years without detection. Even after detection, years of\n\nanalysis were required to understand and roughly attribute Moonlight Maze to Russian actors.\n\nEven with the best resources of the U.S. government marshaled to analyze the attacks and\n\nintrusions, no conclusive links could be found to the Russian government or another large,\n\ndeterrable actor. The frustrating lessons of Moonlight Maze persist; its story has been replayed\n\nmany times in the intervening years as shadowy attackers hiding their tracks have penetrated key\n\n29 Adams, James. ―Virtual Defense.‖ Foreign Affairs.

The operative word\n\nhere is _possible; these could have either been two of the most devastating cyber attacks of all_\n\ntime, with the greatest immediate real-world implications, or they may not have been cyber\n\nattacks at all. Alarmingly, these two cases illustrate both the potential of cyber attacks to do real\n\nharm as well as the tangled web of attribution. While sourcing of details related to these possible\n\nattacks is tenuous at best, available information can provide valuable lessons.\n\nU.S. security and intelligence officials have publicly painted a broad story in which an\n\nunnamed country had cities that suffered cyber attacks that ―plunged entire cities into\n\ndarkness.‖[34] Tied to off-the-record statements from similar officials, CBS News claimed in\n\nNovember 2009 that a number of credible sources indicated that cyber attacks were responsible\n\nfor two power outages in Brazil. The first occurred north of Rio de Janeiro in January 2005,\n\ncutting power to three cities and leaving tens of thousands without power.[35] The second and\n\nmost severe occurred on 26 September 2007 in the state of Espirito Santo, cutting power to more\n\nthan three million people, dozens of cities, and a network of plants belonging to an iron ore\n\n34 Messick, Graham. ―Cyber War: Sabotaging the System.‖ CBS News. 8 November 2009.\n[(http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/06/60minutes/main5555565.shtml). 15 February 2010.](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/06/60minutes/main5555565.shtml)\n35 _Ibid._\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\nproducer.[36] Their claim, which was rolled into a larger alarmist report on cyber warfare, did not\n\nattribute the attacks nor did it provide a motive. Tied to this incident are statements by CIA\n\ncyber official Tom Donahue, who claimed that the U.S. government had information indicating\n\nthat in ―at least one case‖ cyber attacks led to the disruption of power in multiple cities and that\n\nthe government had seen multiple examples of cyber intrusions followed by extortion demands.[37]\n\nThe CBS report as well as former Bush administration official Richard Clarke explain that this\n\nunnamed victim was Brazil.[38] [39]\n\nBrazilian officials not only deny that the cyber attacks took place but offer a specific\n\nreason why the blackouts occurred, claiming that physical infrastructure problems unrelated to\n\ncyber infrastructure plunged parts of the country into darkness. In the case of the reported 2007\n\nattack, the power company, Furnas Centrais Elétricas, claimed no knowledge of hackers\n\naccessing their systems.[40] They explained following the event that the outages were a result of\n\nsoot and dust accumulating on insulators on high-voltage lines.[41] Months without rain,\n\ncombined with burning fields emitting large quantities of particulate matter, resulted in dirty\n\ninsulators that failed to operate properly. Other authorities within Brazil concurred with this\n\nexplanation, blaming polluted insulators and fining Furnas $3.27 million for failing to maintain\n\nits transmission towers properly.[42]\n\n36 Messick, Graham. ―Cyber War: Sabotaging the System.‖ CBS News. 8 November 2009.\n[(http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/06/60minutes/main5555565.shtml). 15 February 2010.](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/06/60minutes/main5555565.shtml)\n37 ―CIA Confirms Cyber Attack Caused Multi-City Power Outage.‖ SANS News Bites.

Just\n\ndays after the CBS report aired, crippling power outages left over 60 million without power and\n\nseverely impacted the most populous areas of Brazil as well as all of Paraguay. The blame in\n\nthis case was assigned to the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, which provides 20% of Brazil‘s electricity\n\nand 90% of Paraguay‘s.[43]\n\nThe Brazilian cyber or non-cyber case illustrates a new range of issues for attribution.\n\nChastened commercial infrastructure providers, even in the face of facts, may seek to avoid\n\nblaming failures on cyber attacks. Acknowledging cyber weakness invites more attacks, and,\n\nespecially if there are no easy immediate fixes, may lead to costly reforms to improve network\n\nsecurity. Particularly embarrassing are incidents where cyber attacks benefit from insider\n\nknowledge, as Donahue hinted at in his discussion of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.[44]\n\nBlaming the weather or a dirty insulator may be more politically and commercially appealing.\n\nEven if cyber attacks are properly attributed, the victim may not want to advertise the\n\nfact. This is not just a problem in the commercial sector, but one for government as well. The\n\nU.S. government rarely discloses penetrations of its systems by the Chinese and Russians; only\n\nonce in a while do specific cases like Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze go public. Public\n\nattribution also informs the attacker that the victim is able to detect and discover attack attempts.\n\nParticularly for stealthy state-based intelligence gathering and covert cyber operations, victims\n\npotentially have far more to learn by identifying attack signatures and quietly studying them to\n\nlearn attacker methodology, behavior, priorities, and tools. Honeypots, or systems designed to\n\nintentionally lure attackers as a way of learning about them, are particularly useful in these cases.\n\n43 ―Major Power Failures Hit Brazil.‖ BBC News. 11 November 2009.\n[(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8353878.stm) 15 February 2009.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8353878.stm)\n44 Zetter, Kim. ―Feds‘ Smart Grid Race Leaves Cybersecurity in the Dust.‖ Threat Level.

Focusing mostly on the Department of Defense and its\n\ncontractors, the attacks also targeted the Departments of State, Energy, and Homeland Security.[65]\n\nThis series of attacks was first disclosed in mid-2005, having gone on for several years before\n\ndisclosure. A parade of unnamed defense officials provided information on background\n\nregarding the case. Opinions ranged from blame of the Chinese government to others who\n\nassessed that at best hackers were using Chinese networks to disguise themselves.\n\nAttackers gained access to unclassified systems on government networks. They pilfered\n\nsensitive but unclassified data from computers, including export-controlled technology. One\n\nanalyst who followed the Titan Rain actors claimed that the attackers left behind covert beacons\n\nthat allowed them to gain access to systems at a later date, permitting both further data collection\n\nas well as laying the foundations for a future malicious cyber attack.[66] According to the few who\n\nwould speak in detail about the attacks, the preponderance of evidence pointed to the Chinese\n\n64Clinton, Hillary Rodham. ―Remarks on Internet Freedom.‖ Department of State. 21 January 2010.\n[(http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm). 15 February 2010.](http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm)\n65 Graham, Bradley. ―Hackers Attack Via Chinese Web Sites; U.S. Agencies‘ Networks Are Among Targets.‖\nWashington Post. 25 August 2005: A01.\n66 Thornburgh, Nathan. ―The Invasion of the Chinese Cyberspies.‖ Time. 29 August 2005.\nhttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1098961-4,00.html\n\n19\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment, as these analysts hacked back against the attackers to map their networks and steal\n\ntheir tools.\n\nStatements both on and off the record regarding Titan Rain highlight both the difficulties\n\nand the politics of attribution. One unnamed U.S. official asked: ―Is this an orchestrated\n\ncampaign by the PRC or just a bunch of disconnected hackers? We just can‘t say at this point.‖[67]\n\nThat attacks originated from China was not sufficient to assign blame to the Chinese\n\ngovernment; the possibility that other actors were using Chinese addresses to mask themselves\n\nprevented definitive assignment of blame. The coached language and sparse details briefed by\n\nsenior government officials on background also highlights the desire to keep sensitive details of\n\nthe attack a secret. In the original report in the Washington Post that announced Titan Rain to\n\nthe world, the author‘s sources made clear that legal and policy considerations, and especially a\n\n―desire to avoid giving any advantage to the hackers‖, prevented them from disclosing more or\n\nmaking a public claim of attribution.[68]\n\n67 Graham, Bradley. ―Hackers Attack Via Chinese Web Sites; U.S. Agencies‘ Networks Are Among Targets.‖\nWashington Post. 25 August 2005: A01.\n68 _Ibid._\n\n20\n\n\n-----\n\n**LESSONS FOR ATTRIBUTION**\n\nSophisticated attackers take measures to obfuscate their activity, hopping through\n\nmultiple nodes and coding stealthy programs to evade detection. Infrastructure from which\n\nattacks are launched are often stolen or hacked themselves, making the job of tying the pointy\n\nend of the cyber spear back to a specific actor often impossible. Chinese attackers nearly got\n\naway with this in the case of Aurora but used sloppy tradecraft and overreached against too many\n\ntargets simultaneously. Ultimately they picked the wrong opponent in Google, which was\n\nclearly enraged and not willing to swallow its pride. Less sophisticated attackers harness\n\ncriminal and malicious systems like botnets, worms, Trojans, and viruses to magnify their power\n\nand distribute attack vectors around the world. The organizers of the nebulous efforts against\n\nEstonia utilized this model, turning a symbolic protest into a cyber riot riding on the back of\n\ncriminal botnets and scripted attacks for anti-Estonian hackers around the world. Defense\n\nofficials will not likely see naval-inspired line-of-battle attacks with flagged government war\ncomputers matched up against opponent war-computers in a battle of tactics and wit. Cyber\n\nattacks will emerge from the cloud.\n\nBreaking through the cloud of obfuscation requires significant cyber-sleuthing resources,\n\npotential offensive ―hack-back‖ operations, and most troublesome, time. Moonlight Maze\n\nhighlighted how it may take years of passive monitoring of attacks to piece together enough bits\n\nof circumstantial evidence to tie attacks back to a region or country, let alone to a specific state\n\nactor or criminal element. Conducted properly and with appropriate stealth, attacks may never\n\nbe properly diagnosed through passive means alone. Both Aurora and Titan Rain illustrated\n\nhow, when combined with the political will to call it as they see it, victims can hack-back in self\n\ndefense to crack through the layers of obfuscation protecting attackers. Google and McAfee did\n\n21\n\n\n-----\n\nnot learn the technical, scary details about the Aurora attacks merely by being attacked. They\n\nstruck back, spying on the enemy and tracking the data as it was exfiltrated out of their networks.\n\nBut even this took time; there was almost a month-long gap between detection of the attacks and\n\na public announcement of attribution to China. In the event that China were to attack U.S.\n\ndefense systems in a far more malicious way, disabling vital systems to cause grave non-virtual\n\nharm to the U.S., waiting a month to forensically swim upstream back to the attacker systems\n\nwould not be acceptable.\n\nThe case of the potential Brazilian cyber attacks on power infrastructure highlight another\n\nstrain of cyber-attribution difficulties: politics. Attribution implies vulnerability. Companies\n\nand governments alike do not like to admit weaknesses, especially weaknesses that they are\n\nunable to fix in the short-term. Admitting weaknesses causes domestic political issues and\n\nespecially in the realm of cyber invites malicious actors to take advantage of the announced\n\nweaknesses. If the Brazilian government or the power company were to admit that both outages\n\nwere due to cyber attacks, enterprising criminal entities would begin in earnest to gain access to\n\nthose systems to hold them hostage for a princely ransom. Additionally, blaming problems on\n\nphysical infrastructure and taking a hit with fines may be preferable to re-engineering entire\n\nnetworks and the costs of increased network security.\n\nAttribution implies a capability to detect and analyze the attacker‘s actions. Stealthy\n\nstate-sponsored cyber attack and espionage systems are designed to go unnoticed. Announcing\n\nto the world that the victim has developed the technical capacity to detect and monitor this\n\nactivity will trigger a change in operating procedure for the attacker. In some cases, the known\n\nand manageable attack is preferable to the unknown and thus unmanageable attack. This is\n\nlikely the case with the Titan Rain intrusion set; its disclosure probably caused much\n\n22\n\n\n-----\n\nconsternation at the Pentagon as it alerted the Chinese that their tools and tricks were being\n\ncaught, triggering a change in behavior, tools, and standard operating procedures.\n\nPublicly declaring the identity of the assessed perpetrator of cyber attacks can be\n\nsatisfying for investigators. But once the attacks start to dissipate the fears of the unknown grow.\n\nHave the attackers learned from the disclosure how to better hide their attacks? Have they\n\nstopped? Hacking back can be stealthy as well if managed properly; public attribution of attacks\n\nmay cripple these efforts to aggressively uncover enemy actions, tools, and intentions.\n\n23\n\n\n-----\n\n**CONCLUSION - IMPLICATIONS FOR DETERRENCE**\n\nThe set of cases analyzed here demonstrate decisively that attribution of cyber attacks is\n\ntechnically difficult and often politically unpalatable. Established networking protocols allow\n\neasy spoofing and obfuscation of source, destination, and intent of packets as they stream around\n\nthe world. Attribution, as demonstrated in these cases, is often circumstantial at best. While\n\nvictims often have strong suspicions of attackers‘ identities built from pieces of intelligence, the\n\ndecisions of war and peace involved in a deterrence policy require a higher level of confidence\n\nthan a measured hunch. To reach even elementary levels of attribution significant resources,\n\nexpertise, and time are required.\n\nThe chilling suspicion of the unknown unknowns, the realization that undetected attacks\n\nmay be underway at any moment, is potentially paralyzing to any deterrence policy. A\n\ndeterrence policy of ―I will attack you back if you attack me, but only if I find out that you did it‖\n\nis not an appropriate cornerstone of a computer network defense strategy. Without a response,\n\nan attacker can assume that the victim is either unable to detect the attack or, even more\n\nemboldening, the victim is unable or unwilling to make good on its threat. Cyber attacks can be\n\na powerful part of salami tactics on the part of the attacker. If attacks are unable to generate a\n\ndeterrent response in the cyber realm, what other lines can the attacker cross?\n\nAddressing cases where the victim state realizes that it is being attacked, Lt. Gen. Keith\n\nAlexander, director of the National Security Agency, recently proposed that his future U.S.\n\nCYBERCOMMAND would support a deterrence doctrine by attacking back in a proportional\n\n24\n\n\n-----\n\nand discriminating way against the sources of any cyber attack against the United States.[69] He\n\nextended this case specifically to those where the identities of the attackers are unknown.\n\nAccording to Gen. Alexander, the U.S. will attack back in accordance with the rules of\n\nengagement and in accordance with the principles of proportionality and discrimination, with the\n\ncaveat that ―neither proportionality nor discrimination requires that we know who is responsible\n\nbefore we take defensive action.‖[70] With statements like this, Gen. Alexander and others are\n\nproviding a strong incentive for enemies of the U.S. to launch cyber attacks on the United States\n\nfrom third-party territory, hoping to lure the U.S. into conflict with a nation that had no role in or\n\nidea of the attack.\n\nWhat the cases analyzed in this paper illustrate is that deterrence is a phenomenally poor\n\nchoice as a core component in a computer network defense strategy. Bloviation and bluster,\n\nvowing deterrent responses to attacks, make for good sound bites and allow for easy porting of\n\ndeep deterrence scholarship to the cyber realm. But less flashy policies and measures are more\n\neffective. Defense in depth, better security standards for software and hardware, robust\n\ncomputer network intelligence systems, and information sharing between and among industry\n\nand government are all good and necessary elements of a more successful computer network\n\ndefense strategy. Combined with aggressive hack-back defensive measures that work to disrupt\n\nor exploit attacker infrastructure, vital networks will be better defended and deterrence as a\n\ngeneral national policy tool will be better preserved for realms where it is more applicable.\n\n69 Alexander, Keith. \"Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, USA, Nominee for Commander,\nUnited States Cyber Command.\" Senate Armed Services Committee. 14 April 2010.\n(http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/questions.pdf). 15 April 2010.\n70 _Ibid._\n\n25\n\n\n-----\n\n**BIBLIOGRAPHY**\n\nAdams, James. ―Virtual Defense.‖ Foreign Affairs.
