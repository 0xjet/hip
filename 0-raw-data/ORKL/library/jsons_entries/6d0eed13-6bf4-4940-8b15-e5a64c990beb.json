    "plain_text": "# Treasury Sanctions Russian Persons in the Crimea Region of Ukraine\n\n**home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0125**\n\n_OFAC takes action in partnership with the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and_\n_Australia_\n\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl (OFAC) designated five individuals and three entities related to Russia’s occupation\nof the Crimea region of Ukraine and its severe human rights abuses against the local\npopulation. These designations, pursuant to Executive Orders (E.O.) 13660 and 13685,\nimpose sanctions on individuals who have asserted governmental authority over the Crimea\nregion of Ukraine without the authorization of Ukraine, as well as target individuals and\nentities for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Today’s actions demonstrate the\nDepartment of the Treasury’s unwavering commitment to counter Russia’s attack on\nUkraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and Russia’s human rights abuses against\nUkrainians. Several of these individuals and entities have recently been sanctioned by the\nEuropean Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), Canada, and Australia.\n\n“This action, taken in close cooperation with our allies, represents the international\ncommunity’s firm commitment to hold Russia accountable for the attempted annexation of\nCrimea,” said OFAC Director Andrea M. Gacki. “These designations impose additional costs\non Russia for its forceful integration with Crimea and highlight the abuses that have taken\nplace under Russia’s attempted annexation. The United States remains committed to\nsupporting Ukrainian sovereignty: Crimea is Ukraine.”\n\n\n-----\n\n## KERCH STRAIT BRIDGE\n\nFollowing Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia sought to connect the\nRussian mainland to the Crimea region of Ukraine, which is separated from Russia by the\nKerch Strait. In 2016, Russia began the construction of what would become the longest\nbridge in Europe: a railway bridge over the Kerch Strait. In 2018, construction was\ncompleted, linking Russia with the Crimea region of Ukraine. With our international partners,\nthe United States has continued to take targeted actions against persons involved in this\nproject, undertaken by Russia in furtherance of its illegitimate assertion of sovereignty over\nUkraine. For example, on January29, 2020, OFAC designated one individual and one entity\nrelated to the construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge as well as seven so-called officials of\nthe so-called Republic of Crimea.\n\nIn partnership with our international allies, Treasury designated Leonid Kronidovich\n**Ryzhenkin (Ryzhenkin), Lenpromtransproyekt, and Joint-Stock Company The**\n**Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Railway Line’s Construction Directorate in response to their**\ninvolvement in the construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge. The construction of the Kerch\nStrait Bridge is a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and has been condemned by the\ninternational community.\n\n**Ryzhenkin is a Russian national and the chief executive officer (CEO) of Mostotrest, a**\nRussian construction company that operates in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Mostotrest’s\nshare in the total construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge was worth more than $1.9 billion.\nMostotrest and its owner, Arkady Rotenberg, were previously designated by OFAC pursuant\nto E.O. 13685 and E.O. 13661, respectively. Prior to Mostotrest, Ryzhenkin worked for\nanother designated Russian construction company, Stroygazmontazh, where he also\nsupervised projects related to the construction of the Kerch Strait Bridge. OFAC previously\ndesignated Stroygazmontazh pursuant to E.O. 13661. Ryzhenkin was designated pursuant\nto E.O. 13685 for being the leader of an entity operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine.\n**Ryzhenkin was previously designated by the EU and the UK in 2020 and in 2021 by Canada**\nand Australia.\n\n**Lenpromtransproyekt is a Russian company that designed the Kerch Strait Bridge.**\n**Lenpromtransproyekt was designated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the Crimea**\nregion of Ukraine. The company was previously designated by the EU and the UK in 2020\nand in 2021 by Canada and Australia.\n\n**Joint-Stock Company The Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Railway Line’s Construction**\n**Directorate is a Russian company thatparticipated in the construction of the railway for the**\nKerch Strait Bridge. Joint-Stock Company The Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Railway Line’s\n**Construction Directorate was designated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the**\nCrimea region of Ukraine. The companywas previously designated by the EU and the UK in\n2020 and in 2021 by Canada and Australia.\n\n\n-----\n\n## ABUSES AGAINST THE LOCAL POPULATION\n\nThe atrocious conditions at the Simferopol SIZO-1 pre-trial detention centerin Simferopol, in\nthe Crimea region of Ukraine, are emblematic of the widespread human rights abuses\nperpetrated against Ukraine’s people. The notorious prison is known for severe abuses,\ncommunicable diseases, poor and inhumane living conditions, and inadequate medical\nassistance. Prisoners are known to freeze, starve, suffer from parasites, and be kept in\npoorly ventilated, unsanitary cells. Among the wide variety of prisoners held at this\novercrowded prison are those detained on politically motivated criminal charges, as well as\nCrimean Tatars and other Ukrainians held in indefinite detention. Simferopol SIZO-1 was\ndesignated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine.\n\n## OFFICIALS CARRYING OUT THE OCCUPATION OF CRIMEA\n\nToday’s action also targeted three Russian officials and a local official involved in Russia’s\noccupation of and efforts to control and govern the Crimea region of Ukraine. These\nbureaucrats are critical to the Russian government’s malign effort to exercise authority within\nUkrainian territory following Russia’s illegal seizure of Crimea. Individuals included in this\naction were: Larisa Vitalievna Kulinich (Kulinich); Pavel Leonidovich Karanda\n(Karanda); Leonid Mikhailiuk (Mikhailiuk); and Vladimir Nikolaevich Terentiev\n(Terentiev).\n\n**Kulinich, a Ukrainian and Russian national, is theso-called Minister of Property and Land**\nRelations in the so-called Republic of Crimea. Previously, Kulinich was First Deputy Minister\nof Property and Land Relations.\n\n**Karanda, a Russian national, is the so-called Minister of Internal Affairs for the so-called**\nRepublic of Crimea.\n\n**Mikhailiuk, a Russian national, is the so-called Chief of the Russian Intelligence Services’**\nFederal Security Service (FSB) Department in Crimea and Sevastopol. Prior to his\nillegitimate position in Crimea, Mikhailiuk was the head of the FSB departments in Russia’s\nVologda and Kaliningrad oblasts.\n\n**Terentiev, a Russian national, is the so-calledHead of the Main Directorate of the**\nInvestigative Committee in the so-called Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\n**Kulinich, Karanda, Mikhailiuk, and Terentiev were designated today pursuant to E.O.**\n13660 for asserting governmental authority over any part or region of Ukraine without the\nauthorization of Ukraine.\n\n## SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result of today s action, all property and interests in property of these individuals and\nentities that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be\nblocked and reported to OFAC. OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all dealings by U.S.\npersons or dealings within the United States (including transactions transiting the United\nStates) that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.\nAdditionally, any entities owned 50 percent or more in the aggregate by designated persons\nare also blocked by operation of law. Moreover, foreign persons that knowingly engage in a\nsignificant transaction or transactions with the persons designated today may themselves\nface the risk of designation.\n\n[View identifying information on the individuals designated today.](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20210415)\n\n###\n\n\n-----",
