    "plain_text": "# COVID Omicron Variant Lure Used to Distribute RedLine Stealer\n\n**[fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/omicron-variant-lure-used-to-distribute-redline-stealer](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/omicron-variant-lure-used-to-distribute-redline-stealer)**\n\nJanuary 10, 2022\n\nJust like the previous year, 2021 ended with COVID and 2022 started with the same. The\nonly difference is that the world is now dealing with the new Omicron variant rather than the\nDelta variant, which emerged in April 2021. While reportedly less lethal than its predecessor,\nthe Omicron variant has a much higher transmission rate, and as a result, daily counts of\nnew Omicron patients have become a global concern. This has renewed heightened concern\nabout the pandemic, and as we have all sadly learned, threat actors don’t shy away from\nusing misery and fear to their advantage.\n\n[FortiGuard Labs recently came across a curiously named file, “Omicron Stats.exe”, which](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/threat-intelligence/threat-research.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=threat-research)\nturned out to be a variant of Redline Stealer malware. This blog will look at the Redline\nStealer malware, including what’s new in this variant, its core functions, how it communicates\nwith its C2 server, and how organizations can protect themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Affected Platforms: Windows**\n**Impacted Users: Windows users**\n**Impact: Various data including confidential information on the compromised machine will be**\nstolen\n**Severity Level: Medium**\n\n## RedLine Stealer\n\nBefore talking specifics on this new RedLine Stealer variant, let’s review what we know about\nRedLine Stealer in general.\n\nThe first reports of RedLine Stealer go back to at least March of 2020 and it quickly became\none of the more popular infostealers sold in underground digital markets. The Information\n[harvested by RedLine Stealer is sold on the dark net marketplace for as low as 10 US dollars](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/how-threat-researchers-leverage-darknet-to-stay-ahead-of-cyber-threats)\nper set of user credentials. The malware emerged just as the world began to deal with\nincreased numbers of COVID patients and the growing fear and uncertainty that can cause\npeople to lower their guard, which may have prompted its developers to use COVID as its\nlure.\n\nAccording to the CIA, open source intelligence, or OSINT, is intelligence “drawn from publicly\navailable material,” although it can include sources only available to specialists or\nsubscribers. Based on the global OSINT information collected and analyzed by FortiGuard\nLabs, the current Redline Stealer includes the following functionalities.\n\nNormally, these are the victims whose systems have been infected with any of the abovementioned stealers, due to which victim have unknowingly had their account passwords and\nfull browser details recorded, and then sent to marketplace operators. Generally, in such\ncases, each user profile includes login credentials for accounts on online payment portals, ebanking services, file-sharing or social networking platforms. As such, it attempts to collect\nthe following information from browsers installed on the compromised machine, including all\nChromium-based browsers and all browsers based on Gecko (i.e. Mozilla):\n\n1. Stored system information:\n\n1. Login and passwords\n2. Cookies\n3. Auto-Fill Forms\n4. Browser User Agent Details\n5. Credit Card information\n6. Browser history\n2. Installed FTP clients\n3. Installed IM clients\n4. It also engages in highly configurable information collection based on file path and file\n\nextension, including searching in subfolders.\n5. It sets up a blacklist of countries where Redline Stealer will not function\n\n\n-----\n\n6. It also collects the following machine information\n\n1. IP\n2. Country\n3. City\n4. Current user name\n5. Hardware ID\n6. Keyboard layouts\n7. Screenshot\n8. Screen resolution\n9. Operating system\n10. UAC settings\n\n11. User-Agent\n12. Information about PC components such as video cards and processors\n13. Installed antivirus solution\n14. Data/Files from common folders such as desktop/downloads, etc.\n\nThe current variant continues to perform all these functions. However, this new version\nincludes additional changes and improvements, which are detailed below:\n\n## Infection vector for the RedLine Stealer variant (Omicron Stats.exe)\n\nWhile we have not been able to identify the infection vector for this particular variant, we\nbelieve that it is being distributed via email. Past RedLine Stealer variants are known to have\nbeen distributed in COVID-themed emails to lure victims. The file name of this current\nvariant, “Omicron Stats.exe,” was used just as the Omicron variant was becoming a global\nconcern, following the pattern of previous variants. And given that this malware is embedded\nin a document designed to be opened by a victim, we have concluded that email is the\ninfection vector for this variant as well.\n\n## Victimology\n\nBased on the information collected by FortiGuard Labs, potential victims of this RedLine\nStealer variant are spread across 12 countries. This indicates that this is a broad-brush\nattack and that the threat actors did not target specific organizations or individuals.\n\n## Functionality\n\nOnce Omicron Stats.exe is executed, it unpacks resources encrypted with triple DES using\nciphermode ECB and padding mode PKCS7. Unpacked resources are then injected into\nvbc.exe. It copies itself to C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\chromedrlvers.exe and\ncreates the following scheduled task for persistence:\n\nschtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn \"Nania\" /tr\n\n\"'C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\chromedrlvers.exe'\" /f\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then attempts to exfiltrate the following system information from Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI):\n\nGraphics card name\nBIOS manufacturer, identification code, serial number, release date and version\nDisk drive manufacturer, model, total heads and signature\nProcessor (CPU) information like unique ID, processor ID, manufacturer, name, max\nclock speed and motherboard information\n\nThe malware also decrypts strings with base64 and xor key \"Margented.\" The decrypted\nstrings are \"freelancer.com\" and 207[.]32.217.89. It then accesses a Command and Control\n(C2) server (207[.]32[.]217[.]89:14588). It uses a unique header,\"Authorization:\nns1=d8cc092a9e22f3fc55d63aad32150529\" to verify itself, and the decrypted ID\n“freelancer.com” to prevent connections from other malware or researchers.\n\nFigure 1. Configuration file of the RedLine Stealer variant\n\nThe malware searches for the following strings on the compromised machine to locate\nrelevant folders for data exfiltration:\n\nwallet.dat (information related to cryptocurrency)\nwallet (information related to cryptocurrency)\nLogin Data\nWeb Data\nCookies\nOpera GX Stable\nOpera GX\n\nFigure 2. Code to search cryptocurrency wallets on the compromised machine\n\nThe malware also looks for the following files for data exfiltration:\n\n\\Telegram Desktop\\tdata folder, which Telegram stores images and conversations.\n%appdata%\\discord\\Local Storage\\leveldb, which stores Discord channel and channelspecific information that a user has joined, for the following files:\n\n.log and .db files\nFiles that match the following regular expression: [A-Za-z\\d]{24}\\.[\\w-]{6}\\.[\\w-]{27}\n\n[A-Z] is a regular expression used to search for files with names using any upper case\nalphabet from A-Z\n\n[a-z] is a regular expression used to search for files with names using any lower case\nalphabets from a-z\n\\d is a regular expression used to search for any digits\n\n\n-----\n\n{24} is a regular expression used to match the previous tokens exactly 24 times\n\\. Is a regular expression used to find “.” (\\ is an escape)\n\\w is a regular expression used to find any word characters that include underscore\n\nTokens.txt (used for Discord access)\n\nFigure 3. Code to search log files under %appdata%\\discord\\Local Storage\\leveldb on the\ncompromised machine\n\nThe malware also looks for and attempts to steal the following stored browser data:\n\nLogin Data\nWeb Data\nBrowser User Agent Details\nCookies\nExtension Cookies\nAutofill\nCredit Card information\n\nThe malware also attempts to collect the following system information:\n\nProcessors\nGraphics cards\nTotal of RAM\nInstalled programs\nRunning processes\nInstalled languages\nUsername\nInstalled Windows version\nSerial number\n\nThe RedLine Stealer variants steals stored credentials for the following VPN applications:\n\nNordVPN\nOpenVPN\nProtonVPN\n\n## C2 Infrastructure\n\nThis variant uses 207[.]32.217.89 as its C2 server through port 14588. This IP is owned by\n1gservers. Over the course of the few weeks after this variant was released, we noticed one\nIP address in particular communicating with this C2 server. Some telemetry data is shown\nbelow.\n\n**IP Address** **Start Time** **End Time**\n\n\n-----\n\n149.154.167.91 2021-11-26 04:34:54 2021-11-26 10:05:15\n\n149.154.167.91 2021-12-05 12:06:03 2021-12-05 13:19:35\n\n149.154.167.91 2021-12-09 16:18:46 2021-12-09 20:00:13\n\n149.154.167.91 2021-12-22 18:38:18 2021-12-23 11:33:58\n\nThis 149[.]154.167.91 IP address is located in Great Britain and is part of the Telegram\nMessenger Network. It seems that the C2 server may be controlled by the Redline operators\nthrough an abused Telegram messaging service. This conclusion is not a huge leap as the\nmalware author(s) offer both dedicated purchasing and support lines through their respective\nTelegram groups.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRedLine Stealer takes advantage of the ongoing COVID crisis and is expected to continue\nthat trend. While it is not designed to have a catastrophic effect on the compromised\nmachine, the information that it steals can be used for malicious actions by the same\ncybercriminal or sold to another threat actor for future activities. Stay outside of the red zone\nby exercising basic security practices, detailed below:\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortiGuard Labs provides the following AV coverage against the RedLine Stealer variant:\n\nPossibleThreat.PALLASNET.H\n\nFortiGuard Labs provides the IPS signature “RedLine.Stealer.Botnet” to detect RedLine\nStealer’s communication with Command and Control (C2) servers.
