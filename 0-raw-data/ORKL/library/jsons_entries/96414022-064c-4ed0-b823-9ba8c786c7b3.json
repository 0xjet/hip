    "plain_text": "## Private Sector Security Advisory | 02/2024 | 1 October 2024\n\n# Subject | North Korean IT Workers\n\n### Situation\n\nNorth Korean intelligence services carry out offensive cyber operations worldwide\nto obtain foreign currency. In this context, undercover IT specialists (IT workers)\nare offering their services to companies around the globe via remote work. The\nproceeds benefit the North Korean regime. There have already been contractual\nrelationships between North Korean IT workers and German companies, too.\n\n### Facts\n\n\nSearch for\nfreelance jobs\nand manifold\nfields of\noperation\n\nConcealing\nthe origin\n\n\nIT workers sometimes work directly from North Korea but sometimes also from\nabroad. They mainly look for freelance jobs on platforms for freelancers such as\n“Fiverr”, “Upwork” and “freelancer.com”. From general IT support to programming\napps and games or smart contract development, they cover a broad range of fields.\nFurthermore, they are active in various sectors, including healthcare, entertainment\nand finance.\n\nNorth Korean IT workers professionally conceal their true origins and use purely\nfictitious as well as stolen identities. To this end, they use forged or stolen\ndocuments such as identity cards, passports and educational qualifications.\nApplication photographs are sometimes generated using AI programmes.\nAlternatively, stolen photographs are altered using image editing software. The\ncountries of origin that are indicated the most are South Korea and Japan. However,\nEastern European countries are also repeatedly indicated. The false names that are\nused are sometimes adapted to the alleged origin. The geographical location is also\nadapted and the possibly North Korean location is concealed from the client by\nusing Virtual Private Networks (VPN) or proxy accounts. The locations that are\nindicated the most are America, Japan and China. In order to further increase their\ncredibility, North Korean IT workers, in addition to their accounts on freelancer\nplatforms, often also have profiles on popular social media platforms and\nmessenger services. In the profiles, the different accounts are sometimes linked\n\n\n-----\n\nDigital\npayment\n\nImpersonal\ncommunication\n\nInconsistent\nCVs\n\n\nwith each other. Most particularly, the platforms and services used include\n“LinkedIn”, “X” (formerly “Twitter”), “GitHub”, “Facebook”, “Telegram” and\n“Skype”. Often, the individuals pretend to have several years of professional\nexperience in the field of IT and especially in the field of software development. The\nindividuals often provide a broad spectrum of references in order to underline their\nexpertise.\n\nThe payment is preferentially effected through cryptocurrency such as “Bitcoin”\nand “Ethereum” or digital payment solutions such as “PayPal” or “Wise”. That\nmakes transfers easy to manage and difficult to trace. Occasionally, the IT workers\nuse accounts that are provided by intermediaries in order to further conceal their\nidentities. Declining advance or bonus payments frequently leads to aggressiveness\nand aggravation. Often, threats are made to publish parts of the company’s internal\nsource code if demands are not met.\n\nPreferably, communication takes place in written form via text messages. To this\nend, the chat feature of the freelancer platforms as well as independent applications\nsuch as “Telegram” are used. In most cases, video and telephone calls are avoided\nand meetings on site, for example to carry out face-to-face job interviews, are\ndeclined. The preferred language is English. However, communication in Korean is\nfrequently offered too, even if another origin is indicated.\n\nPersonal details as well as information on the IT worker's professional career, such\nas spellings of names, work experience, educational qualifications and languages\nspoken, are often inconsistent. For example, if the alleged university studies took\nplace in China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore or other Asian countries, but the\nindividual has so far only been employed in the US, in Korea or in Canada, this might\npoint to an application from North Korea.\n\n\nBundesamt für Verfassungsschutz 1 October 2024\n\n\n-----\n\nConspicuous\nfeatures of\nsocial media\nprofiles and\naddresses\n\nPlacement\nof malware\n\nPotentially\nsevere\nconsequences\n\n\nIn many cases, social network profiles indicated do not match the CV provided.\nSometimes, there are also several profiles under the same name but with different\npictures. Residential and delivery addresses (for work equipment such as laptops\nand other hardware) often change in rapid succession. Accounts are characterised\nby long time spans of online activity. Furthermore, the customer ratings on the\naccounts on the freelancer platforms are usually extremely positive. The\nremuneration demanded, however, tends to be in the lower price segment.\n\nIn confirmed cases, North Korean IT workers have been proven to have installed\nmalware immediately upon receiving their work equipment.\n\n### Assessment\n\nCompanies that work with North Korean IT workers help the regime to procure\nforeign currency and thus indirectly support it in financing its nuclear weapons and\nmissile programme. This can not only lead to risks regarding the reputation of the\ncompany due to compliance infringements but also to a breach of sanctions and\nensuing legal consequences. Furthermore, there is a risk that intellectual property\nand internal data of a company are leaked.\n\n### Recommended actions\n\n_Measures for HR recruiters:_\n\n  - Carry out job interviews in a face-to-face setting or as video calls so that\n\nyou can verify the identity of freelancers.\n\n  - During video calls, please check for eye movements or long speaking\n\nbreaks that might suggest that the answers are being read off somewhere.\n\n  - Avoid paying salaries exclusively with cryptocurrencies.\n\n  - Make sure that personal details such as the spelling of the name, the\n\nnationality, the place where the person is staying, the contact details, the\ncourse of education, former employers etc. are consistent throughout all\nprofiles, portfolios and payroll accounts.\n\n  - Become suspicious when you are being asked whether communication\n\ncould take place via separate platforms outside of the freelancer or work\nplatform.\n\n  - Verify the qualifications indicated directly with the institutions that have\n\nissued them. Only use contact details that you have verified independently\nof information provided by applicants.\n\n_Measures for IT (safety) officers:_\n\n  - Only send work equipment to the addresses indicated on the identification\n\ndocuments and become suspicious when allegedly no deliveries can be\naccepted at the address indicated.\n\n\nBundesamt für Verfassungsschutz 1 October 2024\n\n\n-----\n\n          - Make sure that remote staff cannot download programmes of their own\n\nchoice (such as remote maintenance software) to their work equipment\nwithout consent.\n\n          - Check the access rights of new staff and make sure that staff members\n\nonly have access to files they need for their work.\n\n          - Use end device protection and install new updates in a timely manner.\n\n### How to reach us\n\nFor information about threats to your sector in terms of espionage and sabotage, terrorism or\nviolence-prone extremism and in case of concrete security-related questions or cases of suspicion,\nplease contact our Prevention/Economic Protection Unit:\n\n**wirtschaftsschutz@bfv.bund.de**\n**+49 30 18792-3322**\n\nOf course, you can also contact the domestic intelligence service of your respective German federal\nstate. If you do not know the contact details, we will be happy to communicate them to you.\n\nIn any case, your information will be treated confidentially.\n\n\nBundesamt für Verfassungsschutz 1 October 2024\n\n\n-----",
