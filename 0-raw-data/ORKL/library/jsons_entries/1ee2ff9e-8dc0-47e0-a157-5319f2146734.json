    "plain_text": "**In October 2014, Kaspersky Lab started to research “Blue Termite”, an Advanced Persistent Threat**\n\n**(APT) targeting Japan. The oldest sample we’ve seen up to now is from November 2013.**\n\n**This is not the first time the country has been a victim of an APT. However, the attack is different in two**\n\n**respects: unlike other APTs, the main focus of Blue Termite is to attack Japanese organizations; and**\n\n**most of their C2s are located in Japan. One of the top targets is the Japan Pension Service, but the list**\n\n**of targeted industries includes government and government agencies, local governments, public**\n\n**interest groups, universities, banks, financial services, energy, communication, heavy industry,**\n\n**chemical, automotive, electrical, news media, information services sector, health care, real estate, food,**\n\n**semiconductor, robotics, construction, insurance, transportation and so on. Unfortunately, the attack is**\n\n**still active and the number of victims has been increasing.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The following graph shows daily access to some of the known C2s:**\n\n**You will see a significant increase in the middle of July (marked in orange). The spike resulted from**\n\n**new attack methods that the Blue Termite group employed and that Kaspersky Lab detects. This article**\n\n**introduces the new methods and technical details on how they work.**\n\n**Originally, the main infection vector of the APT was spear-phishing emails. Kaspersky Lab has detected**\n\n**a new method of first infection that uses a drive-by-download with a flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119, the**\n\n**one leaked from The Hacking Team incident).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The malicious code inserted into the compromised site points to “faq.html”.**\n\n**The source code of “faq.html”:**\n\n**The “faq.html” loads “movie.swf” which contains the exploit. In this way, the malware infects a visitor’s**\n\n**machine when it’s accessed.**\n\n**The “movie.swf” header is “ZWS”, a flash file compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm**\n\n**(LZMA):**\n\n**The file contains a big data section, marked in blue:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The data includes 12 bytes of header. The encoded data begins at 0x5dca (“\\x78\\x9c\\xec\\xb7….”) and**\n\n**is compressed using zlib. After decompression, an executable file (with an “MZ header”) is found.**\n\n**In addition to the above data, the swf file also has a shellcode in ActionScript (AS):**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The function of this shellcode is quite simple: it saves the extracted executable file as “rdws.exe” in the**\n\n**current temp directory, then executes it with WinExec().**\n\n**The extracted executable file is “emdivi t17”, a new infection vector used by the attackers. We found**\n\n**several kinds of malware that execute as rdws.exe, and emdivi t17 is one of them.**\n\n**Kaspersky Lab also found some watering hole attacks, including one on a website belonging to a**\n\n**prominent member of the Japanese government. We sent a notification email to the admin and ISP of**\n\n**the affected site but didn’t receive any reply. However, the malicious code was removed after about an**\n\n**hour. The code below filters out any IPs except for the one belonging to the specific Japanese**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Interestingly, the script includes IP information with the variable name “TEST”. We suspect this is the**\n\n**attackers’ testing IP, located in Shanghai.**\n\n**Kaspersky Lab detected the tailored malware, “emdivi t20”. This malware is basically used after the**\n\n**infection by emdivi t17 that serves as a backdoor. Although the versions emdivi t17 and emdivi t20 are**\n\n**from the same emdivi family, the latter is more sophisticated.. For example, let’s look at the backdoor**\n\n**commands they make use of. emdivi t17 has 9 commands; on the other hand, some of emdivi t20**\n\n**samples have up to 40 commands.**\n\n**Commands supported by emdivi t17:**\n\n**command** **md5**\n\n**DOABORT** **d895d96bc3ae51944b29d53d599a2341**\n\n**DOWNBG** **39cd12d51b236befc5f939a552181d73**\n\n**GETFILE** **74a9d3a81b79eec0aa2f849cbc8a7efb**\n\n**GOTO** **4b8bb3c94a9676b5f34ace4d7102e5b9**\n\n**LOADDLL** **67ca07ecb95c4055d2687815d0c0f8b9**\n\n**SETCMD** **48bb700b80557ee2e5cf06c90ba6698c**\n\n**SUSPEND** **ee93a0b023cef18b34ebfee347881c14**\n\n**UPLOAD** **8dff5f89b87ebf91a1ecc1dbed3a6fbb**\n\n**VERSION** **021321e8c168ba3ae39ce3a2e7b3ec87**\n\n\n-----\n\n**command** **md5**\n\n**abort** **5bb94a1c12413a2e5d14deabab29f2aa**\n\n**cd** **6865aeb3a9ed28f9a79ec454b259e5d0**\n\n**copy** **12cba3ee81cf4a793796a51b6327c678**\n\n**dir** **736007832d2167baaae763fd3a3f3cf1**\n\n**diskls** **e120a254f254978fc265354a4e79d1d6**\n\n**doabort** **1f6dcc1149b2eef63f6dd4833d5ef0d3**\n\n**downbg** **1e04875a872812e1f431283244b180d2**\n\n**downbg2** **7f3e982a0d9b4aa5303332aaf414d457**\n\n**download** **fd456406745d816a45cae554c788e754**\n\n**download2** **b5a4000c99977ce512052d4e8bf737f8**\n\n**execute** **ec0cd3cb91fe82b9501f62a528eb07a9**\n\n**exhide** **fc236c4ddd3414cee8bd3cbd937461c0**\n\n**exit** **f24f62eeb789199b9b2e467df3b1876b**\n\n**exuser** **0b5396d6bd0867485ff63067ad9363e7**\n\n**get** **b5eda0a74558a342cf659187f06f746f**\n\n**getfile** **b24ba6d783f2aa471b9472109a5ec0ee**\n\n**getlnk** **71574cf393bf901effa0cbc6c37e4ce2**\n\n**goto** **de94e676c0358eefea4794f03d6bda4f**\n\n**hash** **0800fc577294c34e0b28ad2839435945**\n\n**head** **96e89a298e0a9f469b9ae458d6afae9f**\n\n**hjlnk** **ebb0149209e008e3f87e26659aa9b173**\n\n**loaddll** **0340b5e3f0d0ea71eeef6ab890270fc0**\n\n**md** **793914c9c583d9d86d0f4ed8c521b0c1**\n\n**mklnk** **a3bb50704b87da1858a46455dfb5e470**\n\n**move** **3734a903022249b3010be1897042568e**\n\n**post** **42b90196b487c54069097a68fe98ab6f**\n\n**postfile** **316713cb9f82ff9ade53712ab1cbf92c**\n\n**postfile2** **f15ae485061a10adead43d7f5d5a9889**\n\n**rd** **eeec033a2c4d56d7ba16b69358779091**\n\n**runas** **d88f585460839dd14ad3354bb0d5353b**\n\n**screen** **599eba19aa93a929cb8589f148b8a6c4**\n\n**setcmd** **27dc2525548f8ab10a2532037a9657e0**\n\n**setlen** **846a44d63b02c23bcfee5b4ccaa89d54**\n\n**suspend** **497927fb538c4a1572d3b3a98313cab1**\n\n\n-----\n\n**type** **599dcce2998a6b40b1e38e8c6006cb0a**\n\n**unzip** **0a342b59ecdcede0571340b9ed11633f**\n\n**upload** **76ee3de97a1b8b903319b7c013d8c877**\n\n**version** **2af72f100c356273d46284f6fd1dfc08**\n\n**zip** **adcdbd79a8d84175c229b192aadc02f2**\n\n**They both store the md5 checksums of backdoor commands.**\n\n**When analyzing emdivi t20 samples, we found that it is highly targeted in two respects.**\n\n**Firstly, an emdivi t20 sample contains hardcoded internal proxy information, being encrypted at**\n\n**0x44e79c:**\n\n**The decrypted code is “proxy.??????????.co.jp:8080”:**\n\n**This trick is not new, but it is not widely used. This is because it may reveal its targets, or it is not a**\n\n**generic method and only works in a specific organization. However, similar cases have been observed**\n\n**sometimes in other APTs.**\n\n**The second aspect is quite interesting. The emdivi family stores important data about itself, including**\n\n**C2, API name, strings for anti-analysis, value of mutexes, as well as the md5 checksum of backdoor**\n\n**commands and the internal proxy information. They are stored in encrypted form, and are decrypted**\n\n**when necessary. Therefore, to analyze an emdivi sample in detail, we need to locate which hex codes**\n\n**are encrypted, and how to decrypt them. In the process of decryption, a unique decryption key is**\n\n**required for each sample.**\n\n**emdivi t20 has a function to generate a decryption key using Salt1 and Salt2. Salt1 is generated from a**\n\n**magic string (suspected to be a version of emdivi) with certain four digits (suspected to be an ID of the**\n\n**C2).**\n\n**Example of a magic string:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Part of the emdivi name (“t17” and “t20”) is taken from this hardcoded magic string.**\n\n**Salt2 is generated with a large amount of data that is hardcoded:**\n\n**In most cases, the emdivi family generates a decryption key using Salt1 and Salt2.**\n\n**In early July 2015, however, Kaspersky Lab found a sample that creates a decryption key with Salt1,**\n\n**Salt2, and Salt3. Salt3 is the security identifier (SID) from a compromised PC.**\n\n**The flow of decryption key generation (with additional Salt3):**\n\n\n-----\n\n**In other words, the sample works only on its target PCs. Without knowing the victim’s SID, the**\n\n**decryption key will not be generated successfully, making it difficult to decrypt important data. This**\n\n**means it’s not possible to analyze the malware in detail.**\n\n**Fortunately, we were able to analyze those samples. We were able to successfully brute-force the**\n\n**decryption keys from several samples without SIDs.**\n\n**From early June, when the cyber-attack on the Japan Pension Service started to be reported widely,**\n\n**various Japanese organizations would have started to deploy protection measures. However, the**\n\n**attackers from Blue Termite, who it seems kept a close eye on them, started to employ new attack**\n\n**methods and successfully expanded their operation. While writing this article, another sample of emdivi**\n\n**t20 has been found. It employs AES in addition to SID tricks, making it difficult to decrypt sensitive data.**\n\n**In order to fight back against this cyber-espionage, Kaspersky Lab will continue its research.**\n\n**Kaspersky products detect emdivi t17, emdivi t20, and the flash exploits using the verdicts below:**\n\n**Backdoor.Win32.Emdivi.***\n\n**Backdoor.Win64.Agent.***\n\n**Exploit.SWF.Agent.***\n\n\n-----\n\n**HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic**\n\n**Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.***\n\n**Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.***\n\n**[Kaspersky Lab products already successfully mitigates this APT modules.](https://business.kaspersky.com/bluetermite-apt/4409)**\n\n**Hashes of flash exploit:**\n\n**f46019f795bd721262dc69988d7e53bc**\n\n**512d93c711f006891cbc124392c2e8d9**\n\n**Hashes of emdivi t17:**\n\n**b3bc4b5f17fd5f87ec3714c6587f6906**\n\n**f8d9af763e64c420ffa6e8930727f779**\n\n**Hashes of emdivi t20:**\n\n**3b42577bbd602934a728744f242ffe26**\n\n**f07216c34689a9104b29bbdcba17325f**\n\n**C&Cs:**\n\n**hxxp://**********kind.com/**\n\n**hxxp://j*******a.org/**\n\n**hxxp://j*******b.biz/**\n\n**hxxp://www.n*******b.com/**\n\n**hxxp://www.s********ei.com/**\n\n**More information about the Blue Termite targeted attacks is available to Kaspersky Security**\n\n**Intelligence Services customers.
