While the company](https://breaking-security.net/shop/remcos/)\nsays it will only sell the software for legitimate uses as described in comments in response to\n[the article here and will revoke the licenses for users not following their EULA, the sale of the](https://krabsonsecurity.com/2018/03/02/analysing-remcos-rats-executable/)\nRAT gives attackers everything they need to establish and run a potentially illegal botnet.\n\nRemcos' prices per license range from €58 to €389. Breaking Security also offers customers\nthe ability to pay for the RAT using a variety of digital currencies. This RAT can be used to\nfully control and monitor any Windows operating system, from Windows XP and all versions\nthereafter, including server editions.\n\n[In addition to Remcos, Breaking Security is also offering Octopus Protector, a cryptor](https://breaking-security.net/octopus/)\ndesigned to allow malicious software to bypass detection by anti-malware products by\n[encrypting the software on the disk. A YouTube video available on the Breaking Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVxQxSfNJXQ)\nchannel demonstrates the tool's ability to facilitate the bypass of several antivirus protections.\n[Additional products offered by this company include a keylogger, which can be used to](https://breaking-security.net/keylogger/)\n[record and send the keystrokes made on an infected system, a mass mailer that can be](https://breaking-security.net/poseidon/)\n[used to send large volumes of spam emails, and a DynDNS service that can be leveraged](https://breaking-security.net/dns-service/)\nfor post-compromise command and control (C2) communications. These tools, when\ncombined with Remcos provide all the tools and infrastructure needed to build and maintain\na botnet.\n\nWithin Cisco's Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) telemetry, we have observed several\ninstances of attempts to install this RAT on various endpoints. As described below, we have\nalso seen multiple malware campaigns distributing Remcos, with many of these campaigns\nusing different methods to avoid detection. To help people who became victims of a harmful\n[use of Remcos, Talos is providing a decoder script that can extract the C2 server addresses](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/remcos-decoder/blob/master/remcos_decryptor.py)\nand other information from the Remcos binary. Please see the Technical Details section\nbelow for more information.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Remcos distribution in the wild\n\nTalos has observed several malware campaigns attempting to spread Remcos to various\nvictims. Since Remcos is advertised and sold on numerous hacking-related forums, we\nbelieve it is likely that multiple unrelated actors are leveraging this malware in their attacks\nusing a variety of different methods to infect systems. Earlier this year, RiskIQ published a\n[report regarding an attacker who was reportedly targeting defense contractors in Turkey.](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/spear-phishing-turkish-defense-contractors/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSince then, this threat actor has continued to operate and has been observed targeting\nspecific types of organizations. Talos has confirmed that in addition to defense contractors,\nthis attacker has also targeted other organizations such as:\n\nInternational news agencies;\nDiesel equipment manufacturers and service providers operating within the maritime\nand energy sector; and\nHVAC service providers operating within the energy sector.\n\nIn all of the observed campaigns, the attack begins with specially crafted spear phishing\nemails written in Turkish. The emails appear as if they were sent from a Turkish government\nagency and purport to be related to tax reporting for the victim's organization. Below is an\nexample of one of these email messages:\n\nThe attacker put effort into making the emails look as if they were official communications\nfrom Gelir İdaresi Başkanlığı (GIB), the Turkish Revenue Administration, which operates\nunder the Ministry of Finance and is responsible for handling taxation functions in Turkey.\nThe attacker even went as far to include official GIB graphics and the text at the bottom\nwhich translates to:\n\n_\"Thank you for your participation in the e-mail notification system of [the] Department of_\n_Revenue Administration's e-mail service. This message has been sent to you by GIB Mail_\n_Notification System. Please do not reply to this message.\"_\n\nAs is common with many spear phishing campaigns, malicious Microsoft Office documents\nare attached to the emails. While the majority of these documents have been Excel\nspreadsheets, we have also observed the same attacker leveraging Word documents. In\n\n\n-----\n\nmany cases, the contents of the document have been intentionally blurred as way to entice\nvictims to enable macros and view the content. Below is an example of a Word document\nassociated with one of these campaigns that have been made to look as if it is a tax bill:\n\nMany of the Excel spreadsheets we analyzed were mostly blank, and only included the\nfollowing image and warning prompting the victim to enable macros in Turkish:\n\nWe have also observed campaigns that appear to be targeting English-speaking victims.\nBelow is an example of one of the malicious attachments that were made to appear as if it\nwas an invoice on letterhead associated with Iberia, which is the flagship airline in Spain.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the Iberia-themed malicious documents, we uncovered multiple malicious\ndocuments that were created to appear as if they were invoices associated with AMC\nAviation, a Polish charter airline. Talos has observed the following same itinerary decoy\nimage used across both Excel and Word documents:\n\nAs described in the RiskIQ report, the macros in these files contain a small executable that is\nembedded into the document in the form of a series of arrays. When executed, the macros\nreconstruct the executable, save it to a specific location on the system and execute it. The\nfile location specified changes across malicious documents, but includes directories\ncommonly used by malware authors such as %APPDATA% and %TEMP%. The executable\nfilename also changes across documents\n\n\n-----\n\nThe extracted executable is simple and functions as the downloader for the Remcos\nmalware. It is a very basic program and is used to retrieve Remcos from an attackercontrolled server and execute it, thus infecting the system. An example of this is below:\n\nRemcos is a robust RAT that can be used to monitor keystrokes, take remote screen\ncaptures, manage files, execute commands on infected systems and more. In several cases,\nthe distribution servers associated with these campaigns have been observed hosting\nseveral other malicious binaries in addition to Remcos.\n\n### Who is behind Remcos?\n\nAs previously mentioned, a company called Breaking Security has been offering Remcos\nand other questionable software for purchase on their website. There are no details about\nthe company or the people behind it listed on its website. The website does, however, list a\nvalue-added tax (VAT) number (DE308884780) which shows the company is registered in\nGermany. Interestingly, you can look up the name and address of companies in almost any\n[European Union (EU) country except Germany on this website. Germany does not share this](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/vatRequest.html)\ninformation due to privacy concerns. Because Breaking Security was registered in Germany,\nwe were unable to identify the name and address of the individual behind this company.\nNevertheless, we were able to identify several artifacts that give us an idea as to who might\nbe behind the company.\n\n**Comparison of Public and Private VAT Entries**\n\nThe Breaking Security domain is hosted behind Cloudflare currently, and Whois privacy\nprotects the registrant information. Quite a bit of effort has been put into attempting to mask\nwho is behind this company and the associated software. During our analysis, we were able\n\n\n-----\n\nto uncover several clues about the individual that we believe is behind this organization,\neither due to mistakes or very well organized false evidence on the internet.\n\nThe first thing we identified was the following email address and domain present in the Viotto\nKeylogger screenshot below:\n\n_logs@viotto[.]it_\n_viotto-security[.]net_\n\nWhile the viotto-security[.]net domain server and registrant information is protected similar to\nwhat was seen with the breaking-security[.]net domain, the domain viotto[.]it listed in the\n\"Sender's e-mail\" text field is not. The Whois information associated with this domain can be\nseen in the screenshot below:\n\n\n-----\n\nNormally Talos would obfuscate this data however since it is public in so many places we\nhave elected not to. We also identified additional email, Jabber, and XMPP addresses that\nappear to be used by the author of Remcos by leveraging the data we collected from the\nwebsite, as well as other sources:\n\n_viotto@null[.]pm_\n\n_viotto24@hotmail[.]it_\n\n_viotto@xmpp[.]ru_\n\nIn multiple cases, the domains investigated were leveraging the Cloudflare service. This\noften obscures the address of servers hosting domains, as the DNS configuration typically\npoints the name resolution to Cloudflare IPs rather than the IP of the web servers\n\n\n-----\n\nthemselves. One common mistake is that while the domain itself may be protected by\nCloudflare, in many cases, a subdomain exists that does not point to Cloudflare servers,\nallowing the server IP address to be unmasked.\n\nThis was the case with the breaking-security[.]net domain. While Cloudflare shields the\ndomain, their mail subdomains are not protected. The A record that was configured for the\nmail subdomains is as follows:\n\n_mail[.]breaking-security[.]net. A 146.66.84[.]79_\n_webmail[.]breaking-security[.]net A 146.66.84[.]79_\n\n[The IP address 146.66.84[.]79 is hosted at SiteGround Amsterdam. After various testing, we](https://www.siteground.com/)\nare confident that this is also the IP address where the main breaking-security[.]net website\nis hosted.\n\nOne of the other domains we identified as being associated with Remcos was viottosecurity[.]net. This domain is currently configured to redirect traffic to the main breakingsecurity[.]net domain. However, this was not always the case. Searching for pages\nassociated with this domain in the Wayback Machine, a website that allows users to view\npast versions of a web page, yields the following result in the form of a personal biography.\nThere are multiple clear overlaps between the interests of this individual and the developer of\nthe various tools the company sells:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also identified several instances where Viotto was advertising, selling and supporting\nRemcos on various hacking forums, including HackForums since at least 2016, which makes\ntheir intentions questionable. Below is an example of one of these threads.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the company states that they revoke user licenses if they were to use Remcos for\nillegal activity, as illustrated by the thread below the purported official reseller of Remcos\ndoesn't seem to mind another user informing it that they are using the software to control 200\nbots.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nViotto also appears to be active on other hacking forums, including OpenSC, where he is a\nmoderator. Below is a thread where this user is advertising Remcos and Octopus Protector.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Remcos Technical Details:\n\n[As described in other blog posts, Remcos appears to be developed in C++.](https://krabsonsecurity.com/2018/03/02/analysing-remcos-rats-executable/)\n\nAs the release notes show, it is actively maintained. The authors release new versions on\nalmost a monthly basis:\n\nv2.0.5 – July 14, 2018\n\nv2.0.4 – April 6, 2018\n\nv2.0.3 – March 29, 2018\n\nv2.0.1 – Feb. 10, 2018\n\nv2.0.0 – Feb. 2, 2018\n\nv1.9.9 – Dec. 17, 2017\n\nRemcos has the functionalities that are typical of a RAT. It is capable of hiding in the system\nand using malware techniques that make it difficult for the typical user to detect the existence\nof Remcos.\n\nSeveral routines are looking like they were just copied and (best case) slightly modified from\npublicly available sources. A good example is the anti-analysis section:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is checking for an outdated artifact, the 'SbieDll.dll'. In our opinion, there are not many\nanalysts using Sandboxie these days anymore. A closer look at the other functions is also\nshowing a high code similarity to publicly available projects. Below you can see the Remcos\nVMware detection code:\n\n\n-----\n\n[The following is a code sample from aldeid.com:](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/VMXh-Magic-Value)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe blog referenced above has already described several functions of Remcos features in\ndetail. We would like to focus on Remcos' cryptographic implementation. It uses RC4 pretty\nmuch everywhere when there is a need to decode or encode any data. Examples are\nregistry entries, C2 server network communication or file paths shown below:\n\nThe exepath registry data is base64-encoded, RC4-encrypted data. Decoded, it is the path\nof the executable:\n\n_C:\\TEMP\\1cc8f8b1487893b2b0ff118faa2333e1826ae1495b626e206ef108460d4f0fe7.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe RC4 implementation is the standard RC4 implementation that can be found in many\ncode examples on the internet. They are first building the Key Scheduling Algorithms (KSA)\nS_array at 00402F01.\n\nThis can be converted into the typical RC4 pseudo code:\n```\nfor i from 0 to 255\n    S[i] := i\nendfor\nj := 0\nfor i from 0 to 255\n    j := (j + S[i] + key[i mod keylength]) mod 256\n    swap values of S[i] and S[j]\nendfor\n\n```\nWhich is followed by the RC4 Pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA) at 00402F5B.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhich looks in pseudo code like this:\n```\ni := 0\nj := 0\nwhile GeneratingOutput:\n    i := (i + 1) mod 256\n    j := (j + S[i]) mod 256\n     swap values of S[i] and S[j]\n    K := S[(S[i] + S[j]) mod 256]\n    output K\nendwhile\n\n```\nAs the screenshots above illustrate, Remcos is using RC4 to encrypt and decrypt its data,\nand it is using the PE resource section to store the initial encryption key in the 'SETTINGS'\nresource. This key can have a variable length — we have seen short keys from 40 bytes to\nkeys with more than 250 bytes.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey are storing the data in the following format:\n\n[Length of key]\n\n[Encryption Key]\n\n[Encrypted configuration data]\n\nThis encrypted configuration data section contains the command and control servers, RAT\ncommands to execute and other data. Decoded, it looks like this:\n\nThe decoded data contains the C2 server, e.g. ejiroprecious[.]ddns[.]net, and the\ncorresponding port number, followed by a password. This password is used to generate a\nseparate S_array for the RC4 encrypted C2 communication. The picture shows the relevant\npart of the RC4 Key Scheduling Algorithms (KSA) from above.\n\nEven if a stronger password is used than in the example above, using such a weak\nencryption algorithm means that everyone who gets his or her hands on the binary file can\nextract the password and decrypt the C2 traffic or inject their own commands into the C2\nchannel to control the RAT. The good news is that companies who became a victim of\nRemcos have a good chance to analyse the threat if they have stored the network traffic and\nthe Remcos binary file.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo make the life of forensic investigators easier, we are providing a small decoder Python\nscript that can decode the config data from the resource section:\n\nAs mentioned above, Remcos is using the same encryption routine for all kinds of other\nfunctions, too. For this reason, the decoder program also offers an option to hand over\nencrypted bytes manually. This can be used to decode, for example, the exepath registry\nkey.\n\nWe have used this tool to extract all the IOCs below. It is tested with the latest 2.0.4 and\n2.0.5 versions of Remcos, but likely also works with other versions.\n\nThe user can also copy bytes from a network sniffer to a binary file, and hand it over to\ndecrypt the bytes from the C2 communication to see which commands the C2 server has\nsent to the victim. Keep in mind to use the extracted password, e.g. \"pass.\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the organization that sells Remcos claims that the application is only for legal use, our\nresearch indicates it is still being used extensively by malicious attackers, as well. In some\ncases, attackers are strategically targeting victims to attempt to gain access to organizations\nthat operate as part of the supply chain for various critical infrastructure sectors.\nOrganizations should ensure that they are implementing security controls to combat\nRemcos, as well as other threats that are being used in the wild. Remcos is a robust tool that\nis being actively developed to include new functionality increasing what the attackers can\n\n\n-----\n\ngain access to. To combat this, organizations should continue to be aware of this threat, as\nwell as others like this that may be circulated on the internet.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can
