They called the actor Group5, because it\ntargets [Syrian opposition after regime-linked malware groups, the Syrian Electronic Army,](https://www.securityweek.com/search/google/Syrian%20opposition?query=Syrian%20opposition&cx=016540353864684098383%3A6mcx-eenlzi&cof=FORID%3A11&sitesearch=&safe=off)\n[ISIS (also known as the Islamic State or ISIL), and a group linked to Lebanon did the same](https://www.securityweek.com/search/google/ISIS?query=ISIS&cx=016540353864684098383%3A6mcx-eenlzi&cof=FORID%3A11&sitesearch=&safe=off)\nin the past.\n\nTo conduct its attacks, the group uses social engineering, as it “borrows opposition text and\n[slogans for e-mail messages and watering holes,” Citizen Lab researchers say. The group’s](https://citizenlab.org/2016/08/group5-syria/)\ntechnical quality, however, is low, and researchers suggest that they identified the actor early\nin its lifecycle, before it could launch a full campaign using the malware it staged and\nprepared.\n\nThe group is believed to be state-sponsored, at least in some form, though it’s yet unclear\nwhich state is behind it. However, Citizen Lab researchers reveal that Group5 is likely a new\nentrant in Syria, and that there is “only circumstantial evidence pointing to an Iranian nexus.”\nYet, the group’s activity shows that Syrian opposition is facing continuing information security\nrisks.\n\nThe investigation was triggered by a suspicious email received in early October 2015 by\nNoura Al-Ameer, a well-connected Syrian opposition political figure, which was sent from the\nsame IP address that hosted the command and control (C&C) server the malware inside it\nwas connecting to.\n\nThe email was sent from an address on assadcrimes[.] info, a website found to be\ndistributing other malicious files, including a . ppsx and a .exe. The PPSX documents, for\n[example, were found to be leveraging the CVE-2014-4114 vulnerability to drop and execute](https://www.securityweek.com/multiple-patch-tuesday-vulnerabilities-under-attack)\n\n\n-----\n\nmalicious code, but also to execute OLE objects using animation actions within a PowerPoint\nslideshow.\n\nResearchers also discovered that the group was employing two commonly available Remote\nAccess Trojans (RATs): [njRat and](https://www.securityweek.com/njrat-malware-gains-popularity-among-middle-east-attack-groups) [NanoCore RAT for its nefarious operations. The binaries](https://www.securityweek.com/nation-state-actors-use-fileless-tricks-deliver-rats)\nwere delivered hidden under several layers of obfuscation to reduce the possibility of\ndetection by antivirus software.\n\nThe two malware variants were used to collect data from the compromised machines, to\nkeep an eye on the victim’s screen, or capture passwords and keystrokes. They were also\nused to remotely delete files and even to spy on the computer user via the microphone or\nwebcam.\n\nIn addition to these malicious applications for Windows, the assadcrimes[.]info website also\ncontained a decoy Flash Player update page that linked to a piece of Android malware called\n[DroidJack. The Trojan, which evolved from a piece of malware called SandroRAT, was](https://www.securityweek.com/developers-android-rat-droidjack-traced-india)\n[recently used in a global attack, hidden inside a fake Pokémon GO application.](https://www.securityweek.com/backdoored-pokemon-go-app-infects-android-devices)\n\nThe Trojan was created to capture messages, contacts, photos and other data from the\ninfected Android device, as well as to remotely activate the phone camera and microphone,\nwithout notifying the victim. The use of this malware isn’t surprising, researchers say: “It is\ncommon for Syrians to share Android APK files outside the Google Play Store, as Google\nPlay Services are not available within Syria.”\n\nBecause the assadcrimes[.]info operators left a folder containing the website logs public,\nresearchers were able to identify the IP addresses used by Group5 while developing the site,\nthough they couldn’t conclusively identify victims’ IPs. During the site’s early development in\nthe first half of October, it was accessed hourly from an Iranian IP block. The operators also\naccessed the site from the malware’s C&C server, Citizen Lab says.\n\n“These links provide evidence for an Iranian nexus, and suggest that the operator may have\nbeen taking steps to conceal their true origin IP. However, these steps were not well\nexecuted, which enabled us to track Group5 as they continued to access the site,”\nresearchers reveal. According to them, however, the threat actor appears to have\nabandoned the site after New Year, following a flurry of activity in October 2015.\n\nAccording to researchers, there is also the possibility that a known group was behind all this\noperation and that a key piece that was missing from the puzzle prevented the investigators\nfrom making the correct associations, although the tools used to obfuscate the RATs link the\ngroup to known threat actors (Mr. Tekide) and tools (the PAC Crypt tool).\n\n“We cannot conclude with certainty that Group5 is Iran-based, although the confluence of\ninformation outlined above provides a circumstantial case. The IP addresses observed\nduring early stages of development of the Assadcrimes website, as well as the Iranian\nhosting provider and the Persian language mailer all speak to a level of Iranian presence\n\n\n-----\n\nThe additional apparent involvement of an Iranian malware developer with ties to a known\nIranian cyber actor, whether his involvement was unwitting or intentional, only strengthens\nthe Iranian connection,” researchers say.\n\nRelated: [India-Linked Threat Actor Targets Military, Political Entities Worldwide](https://www.securityweek.com/india-linked-threat-actor-targets-military-political-entities-worldwide)\n\nRelated: [Hacktivists Leak 43GB of Data From Syrian Government](https://www.securityweek.com/hacktivists-leak-43gb-data-syrian-government)\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\nPrevious Columns by SecurityWeek News:\n[SecurityWeek to Host Threat Intelligence Summit Virtual Event on May 18th](https://www.securityweek.com/securityweek-host-threat-intelligence-summit-virtual-event-may-18th)\n[U.S. Offers $15 Million Bounty for Leaders of Conti Ransomware Gang](https://www.securityweek.com/us-offers-15-million-bounty-leaders-conti-ransomware-gang)\n[Webinar Today: Blast Radius & Simulated Attack Paths](https://www.securityweek.com/webinar-today-blast-radius-simulated-attack-paths)\nUS Offers $10 Million Reward for Russian Intelligence Officers Behind NotPetya\nCyberattacks\n[Watch: The Four Stages of Zero Trust Maturity](https://www.securityweek.com/watch-four-stages-zero-trust-maturity)\n[Virtual Event Series - Security Summit Online Events by SecurityWeek](https://www.securitysummits.com/)\n\n[2022 ICS Cyber Security Conference | USA [Hybrid: Oct. 24-27]](http://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/)\n\n[2022 CISO Forum: September 13-14 - A Virtual Event](http://www.cisoforum.com/)\n\n[2022 Singapore/APAC ICS Cyber Security Conference]](http://www.icscybersecurityconference.com/singapore)\n\nsponsored links\n\n**Tags:**\n\n[Cyberwarfare](https://www.securityweek.com/cybercrime/cyberwarfare)\n[NEWS & INDUSTRY](https://www.securityweek.com/news-industry)\n\n[Copyright © 2022 Wired Business Media.
