Working with U.S. government partners, DHS and FBI identified Internet\nProtocol (IP) addresses and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with a Trojan malware variant used by the\nNorth Korean government—commonly known as Volgmer. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the\nNorth Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.uscert.gov/hiddencobra.\n\nFBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using the IP addresses—listed in this report’s IOC files—to\nmaintain a presence on victims’ networks and to further network exploitation. DHS and FBI are distributing these IP\naddresses to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity.\n\nThis alert includes IOCs related to HIDDEN COBRA, IP addresses linked to systems infected with Volgmer malware,\nmalware descriptions, and associated signatures. This alert also includes suggested response actions to the IOCs\nprovided, recommended mitigation techniques, and information on reporting incidents. If users or administrators detect\nactivity associated with the Volgmer malware, they should immediately flag it, report it to the DHS National Cybersecurity\nand Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give it the highest priority for\nenhanced mitigation.\n\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n\n[IOCs (.csv)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TA-17-318B-IOCs.csv)\n[IOCs (.stix)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TA-17-318B-IOCs.xml)\n\nNCCIC conducted analysis on five files associated with or identified as Volgmer malware and produced a Malware\nAnalysis Report (MAR). MAR-10135536-D examines the tactics, techniques, and procedures observed. For a\ndownloadable copy of the MAR, see:\n\n[MAR (.pdf)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10135536-D_WHITE_S508C.PDF)\n[MAR IOCs (.stix)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10135536-D_WHITE_stix.xml)\n\n## Description\n\nVolgmer is a backdoor Trojan designed to provide covert access to a compromised system. Since at least 2013, HIDDEN\nCOBRA actors have been observed using Volgmer malware in the wild to target the government, financial, automotive,\nand media industries.\n\nIt is suspected that spear phishing is the primary delivery mechanism for Volgmer infections; however, HIDDEN COBRA\nactors use a suite of custom tools, some of which could also be used to initially compromise a system. Therefore, it is\npossible that additional HIDDEN COBRA malware may be present on network infrastructure compromised with Volgmer\n\nThe U.S. Government has analyzed Volgmer’s infrastructure and have identified it on systems using both dynamic and\nstatic IP addresses. At least 94 static IP addresses were identified, as well as dynamic IP addresses registered across\nvarious countries. The greatest concentrations of dynamic IPs addresses are identified below by approximate\npercentage:\n\nIndia (772 IPs) 25.4 percent\nIran (373 IPs) 12.3 percent\n\n\n-----\n\nPakistan (343 IPs) 11.3 percent\nSaudi Arabia (182 IPs) 6 percent\nTaiwan (169 IPs) 5.6 percent\nThailand (140 IPs) 4.6 percent\nSri Lanka (121 IPs) 4 percent\nChina (82 IPs, including Hong Kong (12)) 2.7 percent\nVietnam (80 IPs) 2.6 percent\nIndonesia (68 IPs) 2.2 percent\nRussia (68 IPs) 2.2 percent\n\n## Technical Details\n\nAs a backdoor Trojan, Volgmer has several capabilities including: gathering system information, updating service registry\nkeys, downloading and uploading files, executing commands, terminating processes, and listing directories. In one of the\nsamples received for analysis, the US-CERT Code Analysis Team observed botnet controller functionality.\n\nVolgmer payloads have been observed in 32-bit form as either executables or dynamic-link library (.dll) files. The\nmalware uses a custom binary protocol to beacon back to the command and control (C2) server, often via TCP port 8080\nor 8088, with some payloads implementing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to obfuscate communications.\n\nMalicious actors commonly maintain persistence on a victim’s system by installing the malware-as-a-service. Volgmer\nqueries the system and randomly selects a service in which to install a copy of itself. The malware then overwrites the\nServiceDLL entry in the selected service's registry entry. In some cases, HIDDEN COBRA actors give the created service\na pseudo-random name that may be composed of various hardcoded words.\n\n## Detection and Response\n\nThis alert’s IOC files provide HIDDEN COBRA indicators related to Volgmer. DHS and FBI recommend that network\nadministrators review the information provided, identify whether any of the provided IP addresses fall within their\norganizations’ allocated IP address space, and—if found—take necessary measures to remove the malware.\n\nWhen reviewing network perimeter logs for the IP addresses, organizations may find instances of these IP addresses\nattempting to connect to their systems. Upon reviewing the traffic from these IP addresses, system owners may find\nsome traffic relates to malicious activity and some traffic relates to legitimate activity.\n\n## Network Signatures and Host-Based Rules\n\nThis section contains network signatures and host-based rules that can be used to detect malicious activity associated\nwith HIDDEN COBRA actors. Although created using a comprehensive vetting process, the possibility of false positives\nalways remains. These signatures and rules should be used to supplement analysis and should not be used as a sole\nsource of attributing this activity to HIDDEN COBRA actors.\n\n**Network Signatures**\n```\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"Malformed_UA\"; content:\"User-Agent: Mozillar/\"; depth:500;\nsid:99999999;)\n\n```\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**YARA Rules**\n```\nrule volgmer\n{\nmeta:\n  description = \"Malformed User Agent\"\nstrings:\n  $s = \"Mozillar/\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\ncondition:\n  (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550) and $s\n}\n\n## Impact\n\n```\nA successful network intrusion can have severe impacts, particularly if the compromise becomes public and sensitive\ninformation is exposed. Possible impacts include\n\ntemporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,\ndisruption to regular operations,\nfinancial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and\npotential harm to an organization’s reputation.\n\n## Solution\n\n**_Mitigation Strategies_**\n\nDHS recommends that users and administrators use the following best practices as preventive measures to protect their\ncomputer networks:\n\nUse application whitelisting to help prevent malicious software and unapproved programs from running. Application\nwhitelisting is one of the best security strategies as it allows only specified programs to run, while blocking all\nothers, including malicious software.\nKeep operating systems and software up-to-date with the latest patches. Vulnerable applications and operating\nsystems are the target of most attacks. Patching with the latest updates greatly reduces the number of exploitable\nentry points available to an attacker.\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus software, and scan all software downloaded from the Internet before executing.\nRestrict users’ abilities (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications, and apply the principle of\n“least privilege” to all systems and services. Restricting these privileges may prevent malware from running or limit\nits capability to spread through the network.\nAvoid enabling macros from email attachments. If a user opens the attachment and enables macros, embedded\ncode will execute the malware on the machine. For enterprises or organizations, it may be best to block email\nmessages with attachments from suspicious sources.
