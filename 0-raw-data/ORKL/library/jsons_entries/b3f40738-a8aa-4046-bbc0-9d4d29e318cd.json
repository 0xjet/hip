On the other hand, some APT attacks are\ncarried out by exploiting vulnerabilities in region-specific software. Government agencies\nfrequently use such localized software, and this tends to be the target of attackers. Such\nattacks are rarely discussed at international conferences as, by their nature, they relate\nexclusively to a particular country. In Japan, there have been many cases where attacks\nhave been carried out by exploiting vulnerabilities in software that is only used in Japan,\nusing malware that is unique to Japan. In this paper, we will describe the TTPs of attack\ngroups in recent years. We will also describe the APT groups exploiting vulnerabilities in\nlocal software. This paper will provide insights into intelligence analysis and APT handling\nby looking at the attack characteristics (shellcode, malware, etc.) of different campaigns.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nVarious tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) are used by different attackers in order\nto trick victims into becoming infected with malware. Particularly in APT attacks, highly\nsophisticated methods such as supply chain attacks, zero-day attacks, etc. are observed.\n\n\n-----\n\nSoftware that is in widespread use (e.g. Microsoft Office, IE, Adobe Flash Player) is often\ntargeted in zero-day attacks. These types of software are installed on many hosts, making\nthem ideal entry points for malware.\n\nOn the other hand, there are other types of software that are only used in specific countries.\n_Hangul Word Processor (HWP) in South Korea and Ichitaro in Japan are examples. Such_\nsoftware is often targeted and leveraged in attacks against a specific country. There are\nreported cases in which HWP has been leveraged for APT attacks [1]. It is important to\nunderstand such attack cases in order to determine appropriate countermeasures. This\nresearch is intended to document and share examples of attacks in which region-specific\nsoftware is leveraged.\n\nIn Japan, there are many cases where attacks have been carried out by exploiting\nvulnerabilities in software that is only used within the country. JPCERT/CC has been\ninvolved in the incident handling and investigation of many of the cases. In this paper, we\nwill describe the details of these attacks by APT groups in recent years. In particular,\nattacks involving three types of software will be discussed:\n\n_Sanshiro_\n_Ichitaro_\n_SKYSEA Client View_\n\n_Sanshiro is a spreadsheet program used in Japan, similar to Excel. Attackers leveraged a_\nvulnerability in this program to attach a malicious file to an email, which infected the user\nwith the PlugX malware. Ichitaro is a Word-like application used in Japan. APT groups\nleveraged a vulnerability in this program to attach a malicious document file to an email,\nwhich infected the user with PlugX. We have confirmed that this vulnerability was leveraged\nin multiple APT campaigns. This zero-day attack is a peculiar case in which two different\nAPT groups conducted attacks at the same time. SKYSEA is a popular asset management\n(SAM) solution in Japan. An attack group known as ‘Tick’ infects clients with multi‑platform\nmalware by leveraging a vulnerability in the software remotely. This attack has been\nobserved as of 2019, and the attack pattern continues to change. We will also summarize\nother TTPs deployed by these APT groups.\n\n## 2. Attack exploiting Sanshiro’s vulnerability\n\n### 2.1 Summary of the vulnerability\n\n_Sanshiro is a spreadsheet program which is widely distributed in Japan. The file extension_\nof Sanshiro is ‘jsd’. The latest major version of the program was released in 2010, and it\nceased to be sold in 2014. It was mainly used in the Japanese government and education\nsector. The Sanshiro series contains a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution\n(CVE-2014-0810 [2]), which was leveraged as a zero-day exploit [3] by APT actors against\nJapanese government agencies\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2.2 Delivery of the zero-day exploit\n\nThe APT group delivered the zero-day exploit code via a spear-phishing email sent to\nJapanese government agencies (Figures 1 and 2). The email contained a new year\ngreeting and a decoy document with the zero-day exploit attached.\n\nFigure\n\n1: The spear-phishing email.\n\nFigure 2: The decoy image.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detail of CVE-2014-0810 (JVNDB-2014-000011)**\n\nThe Sanshiro software contains a component file which has a copy processing error. The\nvulnerability originates in its lack of data size validation and allows overwriting of the return\naddress of the stack frame. As a result, arbitrary code can be executed on the stack frame.\nThis vulnerability was leveraged to embed shellcode in the Sanshiro document. In the case\nof the APT attack, the shellcode was then executed through the exploit.\n\nThe following software is affected by CVE-2014-0810:\n\n_Sanshiro 2007 before update 3_\n_Sanshiro 2008 before update 5_\n_Sanshiro 2009 before update 6_\n_Sanshiro 2010 before update 6_\n_Sanshiro Viewer before 2.0.2.0_\n\nThe shellcode searches for the encrypted binary embedded in the Sanshiro document. It\nthen decodes the binary with a single-byte XOR routine, writes a PE binary to the file\nsystem, and executes it. The bundled PE file was PlugX [4].\n\nFigure 3:\n\nSingle-byte XOR decode routine.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2.3 The bundled malware with the exploit\n\nIn actual attack cases, a malicious Sanshiro document which delivers PlugX was attached\nto a spear-phishing email. PlugX is a remote access tool (RAT), and infected devices were\ncommunicating with a certain C&C server. Further analysis revealed that PlugX had also\nbeen used in some past attacks in combination with other vulnerability exploits such as\n_Adobe Flash, Microsoft Word and Ichitaro. As shown in Figure 4, each PlugX sample was_\ncommunicating with a C&C server with a different domain name. However, it turned out that\nthe domain names all resolved to the same IP address. From the characteristics, it seems\nas if the series of attacks using PlugX had been conducted by the same actor.\n\nFigure 4: PlugX samples connect to 103.246.112.123.\n\n### 2.4 Attack timeline\n\nThe actor had developed the Sanshiro exploit and used it before the vulnerability was\ndisclosed in January 2014. JPCERT/CC has observed several spear-phishing emails from\nthe same actor since at least 2013. They used various exploits such as Adobe Flash (CVE2011-2462 [5]), Microsoft Office Word (CVE-2012-0158 [6]) and Ichitaro (CVE-2013-5990\n\n[7]). In the case of Ichitaro, the actor leveraged the vulnerability as a zero-day exploit. In\n\n\n-----\n\nJanuary 2014, the developer of Sanshiro released a patch [8] and disclosed the\nvulnerability. Considering the facts, the actor is believed to be highly skilled in developing\nthe exploit and researching the vulnerability of local Japanese software such as Sanshiro\nand Ichitaro.\n\n**Date** **Note**\n\nApril 2013 Spear-phishing mail with MS Office exploit (CVE-2012-0158)\n\nMay 2013 Spear-phishing mail with Adobe pdf exploit (CVE-2011-2462)\n\nSeptember Spear-phishing mail with Ichitaro zero-day exploit (CVE-2013-5990)\n2013\n\nNovember Disclose CVE-2013-5990 and, release the update patches of Ichitaro\n2013 series\n\nNovember Spear-phishing mail with Ichitaro exploit (CVE-2013-5990)\n2013\n\nDecember Spear-phishing mail with Sanshiro zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0810)\n2013\n\nJanuary 2014 Disclose CVE-2014-0810 and, release the update patches of Sanshiro\nseries\n\nTable 1: Exploits used by the actor.\n\n## 3. Attack exploiting Ichitaro’s vulnerability\n\n### 3.1 Summary of Ichitaro\n\n_Ichitaro is a popular Japanese word-processing program, first released in 1983. It has been_\nwidely used in government agencies as well by the general consumer market. In spite of its\npopularity, however, a number of vulnerabilities have been found in this product, some of\nwhich have been leveraged in targeted attacks. Table 2 shows the vulnerabilities that have\nbeen leveraged in targeted attacks. The next section will describe CVE-2014-7247, which\nhas been exploited in many attack cases.\n\n|Date|Note|\n|---|---|\n|April 2013|Spear-phishing mail with MS Office exploit (CVE-2012-0158)|\n|May 2013|Spear-phishing mail with Adobe pdf exploit (CVE-2011-2462)|\n|September 2013|Spear-phishing mail with Ichitaro zero-day exploit (CVE-2013-5990)|\n|November 2013|Disclose CVE-2013-5990 and, release the update patches of Ichitaro series|\n|November 2013|Spear-phishing mail with Ichitaro exploit (CVE-2013-5990)|\n|December 2013|Spear-phishing mail with Sanshiro zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0810)|\n|January 2014|Disclose CVE-2014-0810 and, release the update patches of Sanshiro series|\n\n|Published|CVE|Overview|CVSSv2|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2014/11/13|CVE-2014-7247|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|9.3|\n|2013/11/12|CVE-2013-5990|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|9.3|\n|2013/06/18|CVE-2013-3644|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|9.3|\n\n\n-----\n\n|2013/02/26|CVE-2013-0707|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|6.8|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2011/06/16|CVE-2011-1331|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|9.3|\n|2010/11/04|CVE-2010-3916|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|9.3|\n|2010/11/04|CVE-2010-3915|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|9.3|\n|2010/06/01|CVE-2010-2152|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|9.3|\n|2010/04/12|CVE-2010-1424|Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)|9.3|\n\n\nTable 2: Ichitaro vulnerabilities used in targeted attacks.\n\n### 3.2 CVE-2014-7247\n\nCVE-2014-7247 was exploited as a zero-day vulnerability. The attack was carried out\nthrough targeted emails which were distributed to government agencies and enterprises in\nJapan. The emails were crafted to convince recipients to open the attachment, which\ncontained an Ichitaro document leveraging the CVE-2014-7247 vulnerability. Figures 5 and\n6 show the email contents and the decoy document.\n\nFigure\n\n5: The spear-phishing email.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Decoy document to be displayed.\n\n**Summary of the vulnerability**\n\nCVE-2014-7247 is a vulnerability that causes a stack overflow due to a failure in copy\nprocessing called from JCXCALC.DLL, one of the component files in Ichitaro, that allows\nwriting of an excessive amount of data in the local static array. As a result, the return\naddress on the stack can be altered to an arbitrary value. By leveraging this vulnerability,\nattackers can execute shellcode on the stack.\n\n**Detail of the shellcode**\n\nThe shellcode consists of two sets of code. The first set of code searches for the second set\nembedded in the Ichitaro file loaded in the memory. The second code decodes the\nshellcode with XOR (Figure 7). The decoded shellcode extracts and executes the malicious\n\n\n-----\n\nprogram embedded in the Ichitaro file (PE image). The following types of malware are\nexecuted, as confirmed by JPCERT/CC.\n\nEmdivi\nPlugX\nAgtid\n\nFigure 7: XOR decode processing.\n\n**Details of the malware**\n\nEmdivi\n\nEmdivi is a bot that communicates via HTTP protocol. The malware versions are managed\nsystematically by the developer, and there are occasional functional updates. Among these,\nversions t17, t19 and t20 have outstanding characteristics. These versions seem to be used\nin different phases of the attack: t17 for initial intrusion, and t19 and t20 during the\nincubation period. t17 contains about 10 commands, which perform file download/upload\nand event log deletion. t20 is a more advanced HTTP bot and contains up to 40 commands.\nIt has self-camouflage functions such as hard-coding IP addresses of victims’ proxy servers\nand running on certain devices only [9].\n\nAgtid\n\nAgtid is a bot that communicates via HTTP protocol. It performs basic functions such as file\noperations and downloading/executing files. One of its features is that its communication\ncontains the string ‘Agtid’ in the HTTP request header. It also contains the string\n‘DGGYDSYRL’, as described by FireEye [10].\n\nThe following is an example of the communication that Agtid performs:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPOST /info.asp HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAgtid: [16 bytes of hex]08x\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)\nHost: 180.150.228.102:443\nContent-Length: [data size]\nCache-Control: no-cache\n[16 bytes of hex]08x&[Encrypted string]\n\n### 3.3 Threat actor\n\n```\nIn this section we will examine the actors who conducted attacks leveraging CVE-20147247 based on the malware compile time and file property information. The compile time of\nthe malware used by the attackers is shown in Figure 8. It shows that PlugX was created\nbetween 2014/11/3 and 2014/11/6. Emdivi was also created between the same dates. It is\nclear that the two types of malware were created during the same time period. For Agtid,\nthe compile time was set to 1970/1/1 (Unix time number 0), and the attack using the\nmalware was observed on 2014/11/7. Two weeks after the attack was confirmed, the vendor\nreleased a patch for Ichitaro.\n\nFigure 8: Timeline.\n\n|Ichitaro document|Col2|Windows binary|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Filename|Author|Filename|Family|Compile time|\n|概要と評価.jtd|gfz-l|windump.exe|Emdivi|2014/11/03 2:32|\n|日米外安全保障政策20141106(未 定稿).jtd|Windows ユ ーザー|windump.exe|PlugX|2014/11/03 3:01|\n\n\n-----\n\n|沖縄振興特別措置法のあらま し.jtd|gfz-l|windump.exe|PlugX|2014/11/04 9:19|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|石油技術開発 調査事業成果報告 書.jtd|gfz-l|windump.exe|PlugX|2014/11/04 10:15|\n|★合体版.jtd|gfz-l|windump.exe|Emdivi|2014/11/05 12:15|\n|悪質な資格講座の電話勧誘に御 注意！！.jtd|gfz-l|windump.exe|Emdivi|2014/11/06 4:20|\n|健康保険のお知らせ.jtd|gfz-l|windump.exe|Emdivi|2014/11/06 4:55|\n|有識者懇談会報告書.jtd|gfz-l|windump.exe|PlugX|2014/11/06 11:20|\n\n\nTable 3: Detailed timeline.\n\nThe file properties of the malware are listed in Table 3. We can see similarities in the file\nproperties. One is that the author of the Ichitaro document file (Figure 9) is the same. Also,\nthe file name of the malware itself is identical. Based on the similarity between the files and\nthe timeline of the zero-day exploit, it is assumed that the attackers who used Emdivi and\nPlugX are the same. They are referred to as ‘Blue Termite’ by Kaspersky [11] and others. In\naddition, attack activities using Agtid (referred to as ‘APT17’ by FireEye [12] and others)\nwere observed soon after the Blue Termite campaign. In this way, it is suggested that CVE2014-7247 had been leveraged as a zero-day by these two actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Ichitaro document \nauthor.\n\n**C&C server**\n\nA backdoor was installed in the C&C servers used in Blue Termite. It was created based on\nASP and PHP. The following backdoor has been confirmed:\n\nDST Asp站長檢測Tools (Figure 10)\nAnti-shell (Figure 11)\nSpider PHP shell\nX14ob-Sh3ll\n\nThe backdoor’s functions include file upload, download and execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n\n10:DST Asp站長檢測Tools (ASP).\n\nFigure 11: Anti-shell (PHP).\n\n## 4. Attack exploiting SKYSEA Client View’s vulnerability\n\n### 4.1 Summary of the vulnerability\n\n\n-----\n\n_SKYSEA Client View is a popular piece of asset management (SAM) software in Japan._\nThe software had a vulnerability (CVE-2016-7836 [13]) that allowed remote code execution\ndue to a flaw in processing authentication on the TCP connection with the management\nconsole program. This vulnerability was zero-day-exploited by the APT group BRONZE\nBUTLER [14] (also known as ‘Tick’).\n\nThis software is only used in networks that are protected by a firewall and is not subject to\nremote exploit attacks. However, if it is installed on a laptop PC, it may run on a global IP\naddress via a mobile hotspot. In such cases, it will be exposed to the risks of remote exploit\nattack.\n\nWhen the remote exploit attack is successful, the following file is created and executed on\nthe PC:\n```\nC:\\Program Files\\Sky Product\\SKYSEA Client View\\tmp\\00000001.BIN\n\n```\nThe attacker can infiltrate the network through the infected PC and spread the infection to\nother hosts on the network.\n\n### 4.2 Attack timeline\n\nBRONZE BUTLER used watering hole attacks (e.g. Adobe Flash Player zero-day exploit)\nas its main attack method until 2016, however, since late 2016 it has shifted to attacks that\nleverage the above vulnerability. The attack started in June 2016 and continued until\nFebruary 2019. Figure 12 shows the behaviour related to this attack activity based on\nobservations in the traffic monitoring system operated by JPCERT/CC.\n\nThe activity went quiet temporarily in October 2017, but resumed on 15 March 2018. The\nsame vulnerability is being leveraged for the entire period. The scan activity is only\nobserved on the sensors placed in Japan, indicating that the attacker is targeting IP\naddresses allocated to Japan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Scan count attempting to leverage a vulnerability in SKYSEA Client View\n(Observation using TSUBAME )1 .\n\n### 4.3 Malware infections exploiting this vulnerability\n\nThe following three types of malware are used in this attack:\n\nWali\nSmall downloader\nNodeRAT\n\nWali [15] was used from 2016 to May 2017, and another small downloader was used from\naround July 2017. Before March 2018, the attackers used to leverage Wali and the small\ndownloader in order to spread xxmm [16] and Datper [17], however, the distributed malware\nchanged to another kind after that.\n\n**Wali**\n\nWali is a downloader similar to xxmm. Like xxmm, this malware uses Reflective DLL\nInjection based on Stephen Fewer’s GitHub code [18]. The pattern of configuration data is\nalso the same (see Figure 13). This malware also has the ability to execute PowerShell\ncommands. When a host is infected by Wali, the attacker sends an encoded PowerShell\ncommand to collect information about the host. Figure 14 is an example of a decoded\nPowerShell command. This command results in the host name, OS version, IP address,\nusername etc. being sent to a C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter executing the PowerShell commands, the attacker downloads xxmm, etc.\n\nFigure 13: Wali (left) and xxmm (right) configuration data patterns.\n\nFigure 14: Received PowerShell commands.\n\n**Small downloader**\n\nDue to the fact that Wali’s behaviour has been analysed and its details published in many\nreports by security vendors, BRONZE BUTLER stopped using it and changed to another\ndownloader. This downloader only has the function to download and execute PE files.\nWhen the malware is executed, it downloads Base64-encoded xxmm. This Base64encoded data deletes the MZ signature, and six bytes of data, ‘TVqQAA’ (MZ signature in\nBase64), are added before decoding. Figure 15 shows the code used to decode the\nBase64 data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: Received Base64-encoded xxmm.\n\n**NodeRAT**\n\nNodeRAT is written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js. NodeRAT is a multi-platform\nmalware which operates in any environment as long as Node.js is installed. This implies\nthat the adversary targets macOS and others as well as Windows. Figure 16 is an example\nof source code that changes the command to execute depending on the environment. This\nmalware operates according to the JSON configuration information as shown in Figure 17.\nTable 4 is the list of files that are created when a victim is infected with the malware. If a\nremote exploit attack succeeds, node.exe will be installed because Node.js is not on\n_Windows OS._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: app.js source code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: NodeRAT\n\n\nconfiguration file.\n\n**File/folder name** **Description**\n\napp.js Malware itself\n\nnode.exe Node.js\n\nflash.vbs Script to execute app.js\n\nconfig.regeditKey.rc Registry entry information\n\nconfig\\auto.json\n\nconfig\\app.json Communication destination\n\ntools\\getProxy.exe\n\ntools\\uninstaller.exe Tool to uninstall malware\n\nTable 4: Files created when infected .2\n\n|File/folder name|Description|\n|---|---|\n|app.js|Malware itself|\n|node.exe|Node.js|\n|flash.vbs|Script to execute app.js|\n|config.regeditKey.rc|Registry entry information|\n|config\\auto.json|File to temporarily save configuration|\n|config\\app.json|Communication destination|\n|tools\\getProxy.exe|Tool to obtain proxy information|\n|tools\\uninstaller.exe|Tool to uninstall malware|\n\n\n### 4.4 Attack infrastructure\n\nThe remote attack had several attributes corresponding with the attacker’s infrastructure.\nThe attributes will be illustrated below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attacking IP address**\n\nAlthough the remote exploit attack lasted a long time, only the three IP addresses listed\nbelow were used. In particular, 180.150.227.72 was used in many cases:\n\n107.189.139.237\n180.150.227.72\n27.255.84.171\n\n**C&C server**\n\nCompromised websites were used as C&C servers in this attack, with ChinaChopper [19]\ninstalled as a backdoor. This C&C panel, to which malware is connected, is created in PHP.\nThe data sent from the malware is stored on the server, but the C&C panel does not decrypt\nthe data because there is no decryption key. The attackers also connect to the C&C panel\nin order to download data. Figure 18 shows the source code for the xxmm and Datper PHP\npanels – there are similarities in the features. The victim IP addresses connected to the\nC&C panel are from Korea, USA and Japan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18: xxmm C&C panel source code (left: xxmm, right: Datper).\n\nThe file ‘index_old.php’ was embedded by the attackers in many of the C&C servers. This\nPHP file is loaded on an infected website (Figure 19) and records the IP address and UserAgent of the users accessing the site in ‘htaccess.log’ (Figure 20). It is likely that BRONZE\nBUTLER selects an attack target based on these access logs. We observed many cases in\nwhich ‘index_old.php’ was embedded on Japanese websites.\n\nFigure 19: Infected website loading index_old.php.\n\nFigure 20: Access log recorded in htaccess.log.\n\n## 5. Discussion of APT campaigns targeting Japan\n\n\n-----\n\nThe chart shown in Figure 21 describes the timeline of APT campaigns that targeted\nJapanese organizations.\n\nAs for the campaign conducted by APT10, spear-phishing emails were distributed to\nJapanese organizations in October 2016. The campaign is referred to as ‘Operation Cloud\nHopper’ by PwC [20]. Different types of malware, such as ChChes [21] and RedLeaves\n\n[22], were used in the campaign. The spear-phishing emails impersonated a specific\nindividual and were sent with a malware-embedded decoy document regarding international\npolitics. Most of the emails were sent from free webmail services.\n\nBlackTech is an APT group that is associated with malware such as TSCookie [23] (also\nreferred to as ‘PLEAD’ by Trend Micro [24]). As an example, emails that impersonated the\nMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan and that led to\nTSCookie infection were distributed in January 2018.\n\nIn the Winnti group’s attack campaign, code-signing certificates were stolen, which were\nused illegitimately to authenticate malware and attack tools. The Winnti malware [25] used\nin the campaign has three file components: an installer, a loader (to load the malware), and\nthe malware itself. From 2015 to 2016, a particular sector was targeted by this campaign,\nwhich resulted in code‑signing certificates being stolen and Winnti malware infection in\nvictim organizations.\n\nThis section describes the attack campaigns observed in Japan, which were conducted by\nthe following APT groups by leveraging the vulnerabilities described in Chapters 2 to 4.\n\nAPT17\nCloudy Omega / Blue Termite\nBRONZE BUTLER\n\nFigure 21: APT campaign timelines.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 5.1 APT17\n\n**Attack timeline**\n\nFrom August to September 2013, watering hole attacks leveraging a zero-day vulnerability\nin Internet Explorer were observed. The August campaign is referred to as ‘Operation\nDeputyDog’ [26] and the September campaign as ‘Operation Ephemeral Hydra’ [27] (both\nby FireEye), and the series of attacks are considered to be related.\n\nIn 2014 through to 2015, malware that had been used in Operation DeputyDog was\ndistributed by compromising software updating systems (a so-called ‘supply chain attack’).\nIP addresses that were used in the supply chain attack in 2015 were also referred to in the\nIoCs associated with APT17 in a FireEye report [28].\n\n**Initial access**\n\nAPT17 actors used watering hole attacks and supply chain attacks as a means to gain\ninitial access to victim networks.\n\n**Watering hole attack**\n\nThe watering hole attacks observed in August 2013 leveraged a zero-day vulnerability in\n_Internet Explorer (CVE-2013-3893) [29] and eventually infected victims with Agtid (see_\nsection 3). The attacks observed in September 2013 leveraged another zero-day\nvulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-2013-3918) [30]. In these cases, the PlugX malware,\na plug-in-based bot known as McRAT and a tunnelling tool, Htran [31], were later found in\nthe victim’s environment.\n\nIn the watering hole attack observed in 2014, the domain registration information of a\nlegitimate website had been altered so that the name resolution was performed on a DNS\nserver that the attacker had configured. The server processed DNS queries only for certain\nsubdomains according to the iptable’s rules, and other DNS queries were transferred to a\nlegitimate DNS server (Figure 22).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n22: Domain name hijacking.\n\n**Supply chain attack**\n\nIn the supply chain attack, altered files on legitimate update servers or DNAT configuration\nchanges in iptables resulted in software update requests being redirected to an illegitimate\nserver (Figure 23). If the software update downloaded from the malicious server was\nexecuted, the device was then infected with a downloader, and a bot program was installed.\nAnalysis of an affected device revealed that it was also infected with several types of\nmalware such as Agtid, Derusbi [32] and BLACKCOFFEE [33].\n\nThe compromised update server was found embedded with the backdoor program\n‘mod_rootme’ [34], which operates as an apache module. Mod_rootme can send HTTP\nrequests with specific strings included so that the remote attacker can access the backdoor\nwith root privileges. In addition, the ‘pam_unix.so’ module on the server was also\ncompromised, allowing any user to log in with a specific password and harvest credentials\nof legitimate users who had logged into the service. .htaccess and iptables in the server\nused as an infrastructure were configured to accept access from the IP address range that\nbelongs to the target organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n23: Update hijacking.\n\n**Lateral movement**\n\nDevices that were infected with the bot program in the initial access phase were then\nremotely controlled by the attacker via commands provided from a C&C server, and\nreconnaissance activities were conducted. In addition to the standard Windows commands\nand Active Directory tools (e.g. dsget [35] and dsquery [36]) used to steal network and\nActive Directory information, other tools for network scans, SQL server investigation and\npassword hash dumps were also used. After harvesting the domain admin’s credentials,\nremote attackers gained access to the domain controller using the pass-the-hash\ntechnique.\n\n### 5.2 Cloudy Omega / Blue Termite\n\n**Attack timeline**\n\nAccording to Symantec, the Emdivi malware, which is related to the APT campaigns\nreferred to as ‘Cloudy Omega’ by Symantec and as ‘Blue Termite’ by Kaspersky, has been\nseen since 2011 [37].\n\nIn 2013, a compromised website was found embedded with a Java Applet which leverages\na Java vulnerability (CVE-2011-3544) [38], resulting in Emdivi being downloaded to visitors’\ndevices (a drive-by download attack). From May 2014 to September 2015, spear-phishing\nemails leading to Emdivi infection were distributed to a number of organizations in Japan.\n\n**Initial access**\n\n\n-----\n\nSpear-phishing emails and a watering hole attack were the main attack vectors for initial\naccess. In 2014 and 2015, numerous spear-phishing emails impersonating a health\ninsurance society were observed (Figure 24). Most of the emails had the Emdivi executable\nfile attached, with a fake icon. Emails observed in November 2014 had a document\nattachment leveraging an Ichitaro vulnerability (CVE-2014-7247) (see section 3).\n\nIn July 2015, drive-by download attacks leading to Emdivi infection were confirmed.\nAttackers leveraged a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (which was disclosed by\n_Hacking Team_ [39]) to spread malware.\n\nFigure 24:\n\nA spear-phishing email impersonating a health insurance society.\n\n**Lateral movement**\n\nAfter successfully intruding into the target’s network through Emdivi-infected devices,\nattackers investigated the network drive using standard Windows commands such as ‘net’\nand ‘wmic’. When they found a file they wanted, they compressed it with WinRAR and send\nit to a C&C server using the Emdivi download command. The compressed file was then\ndeleted so that there would be no evidence.\n\nIn addition, attackers used Active Directory tools such as csvde [40] and dsquery to dump\nor search for credentials. Vulnerabilities in the kernel-mode driver (CVE-2014-4113) [41]\nand Kerberos KDC (CVE-2014-6324) [42] were leveraged for privilege escalation, and tools\nsuch as Quarks PwDump [43], Mimikatz [44] and Windows Credential Editor [45] were used\nfor credential harvesting.\n\nOnce the attackers had obtained domain admin credentials, they copied malware to other\ndevices and registered the task to execute it taking advantage of the privilege. Devices that\nwere affected by the secondary infection had a downloader installed, which was configured\nto communicate only on certain days of the week. Even if the first affected device was\nrepaired or replaced, attackers were still able to distribute Emdivi to other infected devices\nthrough the downloader and were able to maintain a continuous presence on the victim’s\nnetwork.\n\n### 5.3 BRONZE BUTLER / Tick\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attack timeline**\n\n_Symantec reports that the attack campaign by BRONZE BUTLER (referred to as ‘Tick’ by_\n_Symantec) started around 2006 [46]. In 2015, watering hole attacks leveraging a zero-day_\nvulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (disclosed by Hacking Team) were observed. Since\n2016, scans targeting a vulnerability in asset management software have been observed,\nwhich was still ongoing in 2018 (see section 4).\n\n**Initial access**\n\nWhile a watering hole attack was the major attack vector during 2014 and 2015, since 2016\nthe attack has begun with scans targeting a vulnerability in asset management software.\nAccording to some public reports, spear-phishing emails were also used prior to 2014. The\nattackers attempt to infect victims with a downloader, such as Wali, by leveraging a\nvulnerability so that an HTTP bot is downloaded from a C&C server to the victim’s\nenvironment. Until early 2016 the HTTP bot used in the attack was Daserf; from mid-2015\nto mid-2016 the Delphi version of Daserf was used, and after that it shifted to xxmm and\nDatper.\n\n**Lateral movement**\n\nOnce the attackers had entered a victim’s network through a bot-infected device, they\ncreated batch files to collect network environment information using standard Windows\ncommands (e.g. dir, net, tasklist, ipconfig). Using the Domain Admin’s privilege, they\nexecuted the ‘net use’ command to connect to remote devices and send files with ‘copy’\nand ‘move’ commands. Other commands used were ‘at’ and ‘schtacks’ to register tasks,\nand ‘Psexec’ in Windows Sysinternals [47] to execute files.\n\nCollected information was compressed to a certain size using WinRAR and divided into\npieces. After having been sent to an external server, it was deleted. The compressed file,\nincluding the header, was encrypted by WinRAR. Even if the file is recovered, the\ncompressed contents cannot be retrieved unless the password is available. In some cases,\nthe attackers sent files to an external server using free file upload services.\n\nDuring the lateral movement phase, Mimikatz and Windows Credential Editor were used to\nharvest credentials and create golden/silver tickets. While a vulnerability in the SMBv1\nprotocol (MS17-010) [48] was addressed and a patch was released in March 2017, a tool\nwhich exploits this vulnerability, known as ‘Double Pulsar’, was used for lateral movement in\nApril 2017.\n\nAttackers set up a VBScript-based downloader in a victim’s device to perform\ncommunication with a C&C server only once upon the user’s login. This way, the attackers\nwere able to maintain access to the network for a while.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this paper, we described targeted attacks against Japanese organizations exploiting\nthree different zero-day vulnerabilities. The software in these cases is used only in Japan\nand is not distributed outside of the country. Nevertheless, the APT groups investigated\nthese software vulnerabilities and leveraged them for attacks. Unlike more popular\nsoftware, it is often the case that countermeasures against vulnerabilities in such regionspecific software are not well prepared. Attackers understand and aim at such weak points.\nIn preparation for future APT cases, security countermeasures for local software also need\nto be considered. As well as supply chain attacks, the targeting of local software\nvulnerabilities continues to be a problem. Details of attacks that target local software\nvulnerabilities are not usually available outside of the country in question, but ideally such\ninformation should also be published in the future. Such information will help analysts to\nbetter understand the threat landscape in different regions and could be useful in\nconsidering countermeasures against similar attacks in their own regions.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Cha, M (J).
