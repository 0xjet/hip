policies\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-now-encrypts-windows-domains-using-group-policies/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-now-encrypts-windows-domains-using-group-policies/)**\n\nLawrence Abrams\n\nBy\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nJuly 27, 2021\n05:10 PM\n1\n\nA new version of the LockBit 2.0 ransomware has been found that automates the encryption\nof a Windows domain using Active Directory group policies.\n\nThe LockBit ransomware operation launched in September 2019 as a ransomware-as-aservice, where threat actors are recruited to breach networks and encrypt devices.\n\nIn return, the recruited affiliates earn 70-80% of a ransom payment, and the LockBit\ndevelopers keep the rest.\n\nOver the years, the ransomware operation has been very active, with a representative of\nthe gang promoting the activity and providing support on hacking forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n[After ransomware topics were banned on hacking forums [1,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-ads-now-also-banned-on-exploit-cybercrime-forum/) [2], LockBit began promoting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-russian-hacking-forum-xss-bans-all-ransomware-topics/)\nthe new LockBit 2.0 ransomware-as-a-service operation on their data leak site.\n\n**LockBit 2.0 affiliate program features**\nIncluded with the new version of LockBit are numerous advanced features, with two of them\noutlined below.\n\n## Uses group policy update to encrypt network\n\nLockBit 2.0 promotes a long list of features with many used by other ransomware\noperations in the past.\n\nHowever, one promoted feature stuck out where the developers claim to have automated\nthe ransomware distribution throughout a Windows domain without the need for scripts.\n\nWhen threat actors breach a network and finally gain control of the domain controller, they\nutilize third-party software to deploy scripts that disable antivirus and then execute the\nransomware on the machines on the network.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In samples of the LockBit 2.0 ransomware discovered by MalwareHunterTeam and](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\n[analyzed by BleepingComputer and Vitali Kremez, the threat actors have automated this](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nprocess so that the ransomware distributes itself throughout a domain when executed on a\ndomain controller.\n\nWhen executed, the ransomware will create new group policies on the domain controller\nthat are then pushed out to every device on the network.\n\nThese policies disable Microsoft Defender's real-time protection, alerts, submitting samples\nto Microsoft, and default actions when detecting malicious files, as shown below.\n```\n[General]\nVersion=%s\ndisplayName=%s\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender;DisableAntiSpyware]\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time\nProtection;DisableRealtimeMonitoring]\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Spynet;SubmitSamplesConsent]\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\nDefender\\Threats;Threats_ThreatSeverityDefaultAction]\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Threats\\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction]\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Threats\\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction]\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Threats\\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction]\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Threats\\ThreatSeverityDefaultAction]\n[Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\UX\nConfiguration;Notification_Suppress]\n\n```\nOther group policies are created, including one to create a scheduled task on Windows\ndevices that launch the ransomware executable.\n\nThe ransomware will then run the following command to push the group policy update to all\nof the machines in the Windows domain.\n```\npowershell.exe -Command \"Get-ADComputer -filter * -Searchbase '%s' | foreach{\nInvoke-GPUpdate -computer $_.name -force -RandomDelayInMinutes 0}\"\n\n```\nKremez told BleepingComputer that during this process, the ransomware will also use\nWindows Active Directory APIs to perform LDAP queries against the domain controller's\nADS to get a list of computers.\n\nUsing this list, the ransomware executable will be copied to each device's desktop and\nthe scheduled task configured by group policies will launch the ransomware using the UAC\nbypass below:\n```\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ICM\\Calibration \"DisplayCalibrator\"\n\n```\nAs the ransomware will be executed using a UAC bypass, the program will run silently in\nthe background without any outward alert on the device being encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\n[While MountLocker had previously used Windows Active Directory APIs to perform LDAP](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mountlocker-ransomware-uses-windows-api-to-worm-through-networks/)\nqueries this is the first time we have seen a ransomware automate the distribution of the\nmalware via group policies.\n\n\"This is the first ransomware operation to automate this process, and it allows a threat actor\nto disable Microsoft Defender and execute the ransomware on the entire network with a\nsingle command,\" Kremez told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"A new version of the LockBit 2.0 ransomware has been found that automates the\ninteraction and subsequent encryption of a Windows domain using Active Directory\ngroup policies.\"\n\n\"The malware added a novel approach of interacting with active directory propagating\nransomware to local domains as well as built-in updating global policy with anti-virus disable\nmaking \"pentester\" operations easier for new malware operators.\"\n\n## LockBit 2.0 print bombs network printers\n\n[LockBit 2.0 also includes a feature previously used by the Egregor Ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware-print-bombs-printers-with-ransom-notes/)\nthat print bombs the ransom note to all networked printers.\n\nWhen the ransomware has finished encrypting a device, it will repeatedly print the ransom\nnote to any connected network printers to get the victim's attention, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Print bomb of ransom notes**\n[In an Egregor attack against retail giant Cencosud, this feature caused ransom notes to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-giant-cencosud-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-attack-stores-impacted/)\nshoot out of receipt printers after they conducted the attack.\n\n###
