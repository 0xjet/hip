The group has spent more than a year attacking organizations where\nIT outages can have life-threatening consequences: hospitals, 911 dispatch carriers,\nemergency medical services and law enforcement agencies. Ireland has yet to recover from\nan attack in mid-May that prompted the shutdown of the entire information technology\nnetwork of the nation's healthcare system – prompting cancellation of appointments, the\nshutdown of X-ray systems and delays in COVID testing.\n\nConti also stands out as unreliable. We've seen the group stiff victims who pay ransoms,\nexpecting to be able to recover their data.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FBI has connected Conti to more than 400 cyberattacks against organizations\nworldwide, three-quarters of which are based in the U.S., with demands as high as $25\nmillion. This makes Conti one of the greediest groups out there.\n\n_If you think you may have been impacted, please email unit42-_\n_investigations@paloaltonetworks.com or call (866) 4-UNIT42 to get in touch with the Unit 42_\n_Incident Response team._\n\n## Conti Ransomware Overview\n\nWe’ve followed Conti for more than a year through our work helping organizations respond to\nransomware attacks. It appears to be one of many private cybercrime groups that have set\nup their operations by leveraging the booming ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) ecosystem.\nSuch gangs obtain their foothold in the networks of their victims by purchasing access from\nother threat actors, who sell it as a commodity. They can also procure infrastructure,\nmalware, communications tools and money laundering from other RaaS providers. Most of\nthese actors use the same methods of access found in many ransomware attacks, such as\nphishing emails and exploiting unprotected internet-facing applications, the lack of multifactor authentication (MFA), as well as the typical avenues used to preserve and enhance\naccess once it’s achieved, such as through the use of Cobalt Strike or PowerShell.\n\nThese approaches are not particularly clever or sophisticated, but often they are effective.\nConti’s methodology often follows the “double extortion” approach that many leading\nransomware groups are presently using. When using double extortion, attackers will not only\nlock up a victim’s files and demand ransom, but they will also steal files and threaten to\npublish them on a website or otherwise leak them if their initial ransom demand is not met.\n\nBut Conti’s methods do have atypical elements.\n\nUsually, the more successful ransomware operators put a lot of effort into establishing and\nmaintaining some semblance of “integrity” as a way of facilitating ransom payments from\nvictims. They want to establish stellar reputations for “customer service” and for delivering on\nwhat they promise – that if you pay a ransom, your files will be decrypted (and they will not\nappear on a leak website). Yet in our experience helping clients remediate attacks, Conti has\nnot demonstrated any signs that it cares about its reputation with would-be victims.\n\nIn one recent case, Conti did not return a client’s files who had paid the ransom. This client\ngot only a small fraction of the file restorations that were promised before the Conti\nransomware representatives disappeared back into the dark web. In another case, our client\nneeded an inventory of all files accessed, so that they could notify parties whose data was\naffected. Conti agreed to share that information if a payment was made, then changed their\nminds, saying, “We do not own that data anymore. It was deleted and there is no chance to\nrestore it.” Like many ransomware gangs, Conti is constantly adapting to changes, including\nrecent heightened scrutiny by law enforcement and policy makers following high-profile\n\n\n-----\n\ndisruptive attacks on the Colonial pipeline and healthcare organizations. When Ireland s\nhealthcare system refused to pay any ransom, Conti provided the agency with what it said\nwas a free decryption key. But there was a twist: The group maintained that it would still\nmake good on its \"double extortion\" threat to publish stolen data on its leak site.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnfortunately, keeping Conti out of your network often isn’t simple. A primary means of\ninfection appears to be through phishing scams, and attackers are constantly upping their\ngame in this area. While phishing emails used to be pretty easy for almost anyone to spot,\nparticularly after some awareness training, we are seeing increasingly sophisticated attacks\nin which the threat actors have done plenty of homework on their intended victims.\nSometimes they’ll send a blitz of scam emails to employees throughout an organization, and\nit takes only one to open the attachment and release the malware into the network.\n\nRansomware attacks are getting easier to unleash, and the rewards to the attackers are still\ngrowing by leaps and bounds. Accordingly, it continues to be a growth industry that will\nattract multitudes of new practitioners, and it is likely that high-profile targets will continue to\nfall.\n\nPalo Alto Networks detects and prevents Conti ransomware in the following ways:\n\n[WildFire: All known samples are identified as malware.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\n[Cortex XDR with:](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n\nIndicators for Conti ransomware.\nAnti-Ransomware Module to detect Conti ransomware encryption behaviors.\nLocal Analysis detection for Conti binaries.\n[Next-Generation Firewalls: DNS Signatures detect the known Conti ransomware](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\ncommand and control (C2) domains, which are also categorized as malware in\n[Advanced URL Filtering.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering)\n[AutoFocus: Tracking related activity using the Conti tag.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus)\n[Unit 42 Security Consulting: The Ransomware Readiness Assessment detects any](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-readiness-assessment)\nhidden threats, tests for preparedness and provides remediation recommendations.\n\n[Additionally, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) associated with Conti are available on GitHub,](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/Conti_IOCs.txt)\nand have been published to the Unit 42 TAXII [feed.](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/tree/master/stix2-reports/report_json)\n\n## Courses of Action\n\n**Product / Service** **Course of Action**\n\n**Initial Access**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe below courses of action mitigate the following\ntechniques:\n[Exploit Public-Facing Application [T1190], Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190)\n[Attachment [T1566.001]](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)\n\nThreat Prevention† Ensure a secure Vulnerability\nProtection Profile is applied\nto all security rules allowing\ntraffic\n\nEnsure a Vulnerability Protection Profile is set to block\nattacks against critical and high vulnerabilities, and set to\ndefault on medium, low and informational vulnerabilities\n\nEnsure that antivirus profiles are set to block on all\ndecoders except 'imap' and 'pop3'\n\nEnsure a secure antivirus profile is applied to all relevant\nsecurity policies\n\nWildfire† Ensure forwarding is enabled\nfor all applications and file\ntypes in WildFire file blocking\nprofiles\n\nEnsure that WildFire file size upload limits are maximized\n\nEnsure a WildFire Analysis profile is enabled for all\nsecurity policies\n\nEnsure forwarding of decrypted content to WildFire is\nenabled\n\nEnsure all WildFire session information settings are\nenabled\n\nEnsure alerts are enabled for malicious files detected by\nWildFire\n\nEnsure 'WildFire Update Schedule' is set to download and\ninstall updates every minute\n\nCortex XSOAR Deploy XSOAR Playbook\nCortex XDR -
