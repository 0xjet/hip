While supply[chain attacks were already a documented attack vector leveraged by a number of APT](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/)\nactors, this specific campaign stood out due to the extreme carefulness of the attackers and\n[the high-profile nature of their victims. It is believed that when FireEye discovered the first](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\ntraces of the campaign, the threat actor (DarkHalo aka Nobelium) had already been working\non it for over a year. Evidence gathered so far indicates that DarkHalo spent six months\ninside OrionIT’s networks to perfect their attack and make sure that their tampering of the\nbuild chain wouldn’t cause any adverse effects.\n\nThe first malicious update was pushed to SolarWinds users in March 2020, and it contained\na malware named Sunburst. We can only assume that DarkHalo leveraged this access to\ncollect intelligence until the day they were discovered. The following timeline sums up the\ndifferent steps of the campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky’s GReAT team also investigated this supply-chain attack, and released two blog\nposts about it:\n\nIn December 2020, we analyzed the DNS-based protocol of the malicious implant and\n[determined it leaked the identity of the victims selected for further exploitation by](https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/)\nDarkHalo.\n[One month later, we discovered interesting similarities between Sunburst and Kazuar,](https://securelist.com/sunburst-backdoor-kazuar/99981/)\n[another malware family linked to Turla by Palo Alto.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/)\n\n[In March 2021, FireEye and](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/sunshuttle-second-stage-backdoor-targeting-us-based-entity.html) [Microsoft released additional information about the second-](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\nstage malware used during the campaign, Sunshuttle (aka GoldMax). Later in May 2021,\n[Microsoft also attributed spear-phishing campaign impersonating a US-based organization to](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\nNobelium. But by then the trail had already gone cold: DarkHalo had long since ceased\noperations, and no subsequent attacks were ever linked to them.\n\n## DNS hijacking\n\nLater this year, in June, our internal systems found traces of a successful DNS hijacking\naffecting several government zones of a CIS member state. These incidents occurred during\nshort periods in December 2020 and January 2021 and allowed the malicious threat actor to\nredirect traffic from government mail servers to machines they controlled.\n\n\n**Zone** **Period during which the authoritative servers were**\n**malicious**\n\n\n**Hijacked**\n**domains**\n\n\n-----\n\nmfa.*** December 22-23, 2020 and\n\nJanuary 13-14, 2021\n\n\nmail.mfa.***\n\nkk.mfa.***\n\n\ninvest.*** December 28, 2020 to January 13, 2021 mail.invest.***\n\nfiu.*** December 29, 2020 to January 14, 2021 mx1.fiu.***\n\nmail.fiu.***\n\ninfocom.*** January 13-14, 2021 mail.infocom.***\n\nDuring these time frames, the authoritative DNS servers for the zones above were switched\nto attacker-controlled resolvers. These hijacks were for the most part relatively brief and\nappear to have primarily targeted the mail servers of the affected organizations. We do not\nknow how the threat actor was able to achieve this, but we assume they somehow obtained\ncredentials to the control panel of the registrar used by the victims.\n\nWhile the malicious redirections were active, visitors were directed to webmail login pages\nthat mimicked the original ones. Due to the fact that the attackers controlled the various\ndomain names they were hijacking, they were able to obtain legitimate SSL certificates from\nLet’s Encrypt for all these fake pages, making it very difficult for non-educated visitors to\nnotice the attack – after all, they were connecting to the usual URL and landed on a secure\npage.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Malicious webmail login page set up by the attackers_**\n\nIn all likelihood, any credentials typed in such webpages were harvested by the attackers\nand reused in subsequent stages of the attack. In some cases, they also added a message\non the page to trick the user into installing a malicious “security update”. In the screenshot\nabove, the text reads: “to continue working with the email service, you need to install a\nsecurity update: download the update”.\n\nThe link leads to an executable file which is a downloader for a previously unknown malware\nfamily that we now know as Tomiris.\n\n## Tomiris\n\nTomiris is a backdoor written in Go whose role is to continuously query its C2 server for\nexecutables to download and execute on the victim system. Before performing any\noperations, it sleeps for at least nine minutes in a possible attempt to defeat sandbox-based\nanalysis systems. It establishes persistence with scheduled tasks by creating and running a\nbatch file containing the following command:\n\n\n-----\n\n1 SCHTASKS /CREATE /SC DAILY /TN StartDVL /TR \"[path to self]\" /ST 10:00\n\nThe C2 server address is not embedded directly inside Tomiris: instead, it connects to a\nsignalization server that provides the URL and port to which the backdoor should connect.\nThen Tomiris sends GET requests to that URL until the C2 server responds with a JSON\nobject of the following structure:\n\n1 {\"filename\": \"[filename]\", \"args\": \"[arguments]\", \"file\": \"[base64-encoded executable]\"}\n\nThis object describes an executable that is dropped on the victim machine and run with the\nprovided arguments. This feature and the fact that Tomiris has no capability beyond\ndownloading more tools indicates there are additional pieces to this toolset, but unfortunately\nwe have so far been unable to recover them.\n\nWe also identified a Tomiris variant (internally named “SBZ”, MD5\n[51AA89452A9E57F646AB64BE6217788E) which acts as a filestealer, and uploads any](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/51AA89452A9E57F646AB64BE6217788E/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\nrecent file matching a hardcoded set of extensions (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .rar, etc.) to the C2.\n\nFinally, some small clues found during this investigation indicate with low confidence that the\nauthors of Tomiris could be Russian-speaking.\n\n## The Tomiris connection\n\nWhile analyzing Tomiris, we noticed a number of similarities with the Sunshuttle malware\ndiscussed above:\n\nBoth malware families were developed in Go, with optional UPX packing.\nThe same separator (“|”) is used in the configuration file to separate elements.\nIn the two families, the same encryption/obfuscation scheme is used to encode\nconfiguration files and communicate with the C2 server.\nAccording to Microsoft’s report, Sunshuttle relied on scheduled tasks for persistence as\nwell.\nBoth families comparably rely on randomness:\n\nSunshuttle randomizes its referrer and decoy URLs used to generate benign\ntraffic. It also sleeps 5-10 seconds (by default) between each request.\nTomiris adds a random delay (0-2 seconds or 0-30 seconds depending on the\ncontext) to the base time it sleeps at various times during the execution. It also\ncontains a list of target folders to drop downloaded executables, from which the\nprogram chooses at random.\nTomiris and Sunshuttle both gratuitously reseed the RNG with the output of Now()\nbefore each call.\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth malware families regularly sleep during their execution to avoid generating too\nmuch network activity.\nThe general workflow of the two programs, in particular the way features are distributed\ninto functions, feel similar enough that this analyst feels they could be indicative of\nshared development practices. An example of this is how the main loop of the program\nis transferred to a new goroutine when the preparation steps are complete, while the\nmain thread remains mostly inactive forever.\nEnglish mistakes were found in both the Tomiris (“isRunned”) and Sunshuttle\n(“EXECED” instead of “executed”) strings.\n\nNone of these items, taken individually, is enough to link Tomiris and Sunshuttle with\nsufficient confidence. We freely admit that a number of these data points could be accidental,\nbut still feel that taken together they at least suggest the possibility of common authorship or\nshared development practices.\n\nA final piece of circumstantial evidence we would like to present is the discovery that other\nmachines in a network infected with Tomiris were infected with the Kazuar backdoor.\nUnfortunately, the available data doesn’t allow us to determine whether one of the malicious\nprograms leads to the deployment of the other, or if they originate from two independent\nincidents.\n\nThe next diagram sums up the weak links we were able to uncover between the three\nmalware families mentioned in this article:\n\nIn the end, a number of clues hint at links between Sunburst, Kazuar and Tomiris, but it feel\nlike we’re still missing one piece of evidence that would allow us to attribute them all to a\nsingle threat actor We would like to conclude this segment by addressing the possibility of a\n\n\n-----\n\nfalse flag attack: it could be argued that due to the high-profile nature of Sunshuttle, other\nthreat actors could have purposefully tried to reproduce its design in order to mislead\nanalysts. The earliest Tomiris sample we are aware of appeared in February 2021, one\nmonth before Sunshuttle was revealed to the world. While it is possible that other APTs were\naware of the existence of this tool at this time, we feel it is unlikely they would try to imitate it\nbefore it was even disclosed. A much likelier (but yet unconfirmed) hypothesis is that\nSunshuttle’s authors started developing Tomiris around December 2020 when the\nSolarWinds operation was discovered, as a replacement for their burned toolset.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIf our guess that Tomiris and Sunshuttle are connected is correct, it would shed new light on\nthe way threat actors rebuild capacities after being caught. We would like to encourage the\nthreat intelligence community to reproduce this research, and provide second opinions about\nthe similarities we discovered between Sunshuttle and Tomiris. In order to bootstrap efforts,\nKaspersky is pleased to announce a free update to our Targeted Malware Reverse\nEngineering class, featuring a whole new track dedicated to reverse engineering Go malware\nand using Sunshuttle as an example.
