In this part of the analysis, we will try to discover who might be behind the\ndistribution of these files.\n\n## Who’s Behind these Malicious Files\n\nIn part 1, we discussed that the BADNEWS backdoor is being dropped by a malicious RTF\nexploiting CVE-2015-1641. Interestingly, these RTF exploits contain an INCLUDEPICTURE\nfield to insert a picture into the document which points to these URLs:\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://aliandqazi.com/Jobs/\n\nhxxp://www.tassonedil.it/news/\n\nhxxp://www.justfood.pk/news/\n\nCuriously, we tried visiting the URL hxxp://www.justfood.pk/news/ from the RTF exploit to see\nthe reply:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe URL returns the DOC file, Senate_panel.doc. However, the file returned is only 8 bytes\nlong. Interestingly, it contains next sequence of bytes:\n\n“0D 0A 20 20-20 20 20 20”:\n\n“0D 0A” – is a “\\r\\n” – standard sequence of bytes for new line.\n\n“20” – is a spacebar.\n\nThere is not much we can tell from the content of this file, but the name of the returning file,\n“Senate_panel.doc”, is not accidental. This name is closely tied with the file content.\nMoreover, the initial RTF exploit was submitted on VT with this name:\n\nSo this is not a coincidence, and the people who crafted the RTF exploit somehow control\n_Justfood.pk._\n\nSo let’s now look at this main page of the site:\n\nWe see that this site was hacked by somebody with the Nickname R00T D3STR0Y3R. And it\nwas hacked before the RTF file was uploaded on VT.\n\nHere is a screenshot from hacker’s database, from February of 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we can see, Justfood.pk was hacked by R00T D3STR0Y3R from the anti-Pakistan group\n“LulzSec india,” and it is happened no later than 2017-02-09.\n\nThe RTF exploit file was uploaded on VT on 2017-03-06. So there is a good chance that\nR00T D3STR0Y3R already controlled this site when it was used for attacks with the RTF\nexploit.\n\nWe can’t tell for sure if R00T D3STR0Y3R stands behind the BadNews attacks, or this may\njust be a coincidence and he merely “defaced” the site that was used by another antiPakistan group.\n\nBut that seems unlikely. However, we think that the legal authorities of India have no need to\nguess since it is very probable that they can ask R00T D3STR0Y3R in person.\n\nActually, finding R00T D3STR0Y3R’s real identity was pretty easy and straightforward.\n\nFirst, we found this script on the cxsecurity site:\n\n[https://cxsecurity.com/search/author/DESC/AND/FIND/1/10/r00t+d3str0y3r/](https://cxsecurity.com/search/author/DESC/AND/FIND/1/10/r00t+d3str0y3r/)\n\n\n-----\n\nInside the script there are credits to “R00T D3STR0Y3R,” along with greetings to “Lulzsec\n_India” and “All indian Hackers”:_\n\nThere is also a reference to this Facebook page.\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/rootdestroyer](https://www.facebook.com/rootdestroyer)\n\nWe followed the link and…\n\nPlease welcome Mukund Rajput from the “Dr. Jivraj mehta Institute Of Technology”:\n\nThis page claims that Mukund and r00t d3str0y3r are the same person.\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course, we can t tell if this claim is true or not. But we hope that Indian Law enforcement\nagencies try to answer that question.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBADNEWS backdoor is not a sophisticated piece of malware. In fact, it doesn’t use any new\nmalware techniques at all. It is neither packed nor heavily obfuscated. Its tring obfuscation is\njust simple reversing and minus 1 encryption. But, it uses proven techniques to bypass the\nHIPS detection used by security programs by piggybacking onto a signed legitimate file,\nwhich allows it to deliver its malicious payload. It also proves, once again, that there’s rarely\nany need to use stealthier or more sophisticated attacks, because simple techniques work.\n\nBad news though for the bad guys, and good news for our customers, as Fortinet covers\ndetection for the BADNEWS backdoor as W32/Bdnews.A!tr.bdr and the malicious RTF as\nMSOffice/CVE_2015_1641.A!exploit.\n\n[C&C URLs were also blocked by Fortinet’s Web Filter.](https://fortiguard.com/iprep?data=109.228.49.213)\n\n-= FortiGuard Lion Team =\n**IOCs:**\n\nSha256:\n\nbf93ca5f497fc7f38533d37fd4c083523ececc34aa2d3660d81014c0d9091ae3\n\n17c3d0fe08e1184c9737144fa065f4530def30d6591e5414a36463609f9aa53a\n\n8e0574ebf3dc640ac82987ab6ee2a02fc3dd5eaf4f6b5275272ba887acd15ac0\n\n0c63ef29d5a9674a00bb71a150d2ae6f3dc856a43291e79260992f08fdcd53d3\n\n0c63ef29d5a9674a00bb71a150d2ae6f3dc856a43291e79260992f08fdcd53d3\n\n722e8909235ae572c7baa522a675ce45ac7e10170be7428de74d04f051f473c9\n\nf61aa8c6590926533b67467603d2f42cdb1d5e1f20a5439d7e58fdaf81710711\n\nc9642f44d33e4c990066ce6fa0b0956ff5ace6534b64160004df31b9b690c9cd\n\n**C&C Urls:**\n\nhxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.php?feedid=49321\n\nhxxp://feed43.com/0414303388550176.xml\n\nhxxps://r0nald2017.wordpress.com/2017/02/16/my-first-post/\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://github.com/r0nald2017/project1/blob/master/xml.xml\n\nr0b1n.crabdance.com\n\nr0nald.ignorelist.com\n\nhxxps://musicall12.wordpress.com/29-2/\n\nhxxp://overthemontains.weebly.com/paragliding-stuff\n\nhxxps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zunaid-zunaid1/project11/master/xml.xml\n\nd0nald1.strangled.net\n\nd0nald2.strangled.net\n\nd0nald.strangled.net\n\nhxxp://feed43.com/5787707581531238.xml\n\nhxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.php?feedid=49297\n\nhxxps://robins0n12.wordpress.com/2017/01/31/my-biography/\n\nhxxps://raw.githubusercontent.com/devonkearns/cricket/master/xml.xml\n\nmaxx.crabdance.com\n\nmu5.ignorelist.com\n\nhxxp://80.255.3.96/r0g3r/dqvabs.php\n\n185.82.217.200/@lb3rt/dqvabs.php\n\nhxxp://80.255.3.96/max1mu5/dqvabs.php\n\n### Related Posts\n\nCopyright © 2022 Fortinet, Inc.
