One is the compiled build of the\nexecutable to make the tool more accessible and the second is a sample encrypted file\n“spider.png.blackbyte” that can be used to test the decryptor.\n\nThe decryptor takes a file (or files) encrypted by the ransomware as well as the raw encryption key in the\nfake image file “forest.png”. For instance:\n\nBlackByteDecryptor forest.png spider.png.blackbyte\n\nIn the example the file “spider.png.blackbyte” has been encrypted by BlackByte. By using the key in\n“forest.png”, we can decrypt the file and retrieve “spider.png”. At no time is the original encrypted file,\n“spider.png.blackbyte”, modified.\n\nAs mentioned in the blog post, we know that “forest.png” was used as a key across multiple systems\ninfected with BlackByte. Based on the retrieval of that key from a hardcoded web server\n(hxxp://45.9.148.114/forest.png), we believe that it’s likely that this key was reused across many, if not all,\ncurrent victims.\n\nHowever, it’s certainly possible that the actors behind BlackByte might have changed that key file at some\npoint. While it was taken down and no longer accessible, they may have used different “forest.png” files for\ndifferent victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In cases where the key might be different, the decryptor and key we provide here will not work to recover](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/BlackByteDecryptor)\nthe victim’s data. That said, it will also cause no harm or damage your data (at least not any further than it\nalready was by BlackByte). When the victim attempts to run the decryptor as in the previous example:\n\nBlackByteDecryptor forest.png spider.png.blackbyte\n\nThe resulting recovered file “spider.png” will simply be garbage data as the incorrect key was used.\nAdditionally, if the file “spider.png” already existed on the system for any reason, perhaps recovered from a\nbackup, or copied from another system, the decryptor will exit out with the error:\n\nWarning: Target file spiderlabs.png exists. Not overwriting.\n\nThe important part here is that the original, encrypted file, “spider.png.blackbyte”, will still be on the system\nand unmodified. If the victim can access the correct key file originally used to encrypt their data, then\nrecovery is still possible.\n\nThe key itself however is only downloaded to the victim system’s memory and not stored on disk. This\nmeans victims would need to pull the key using memory dump tools on a fresh victim system. Because of\nthis, and since we believe that the key we spotted and archived is likely reused by many victims, we provide\nthat key with the decryptor in the hopes of helping those affected to recover.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDuring a recent malware incident response case, we encountered an interesting piece of ransomware that\ngoes by the name of BlackByte.\n\nWe thought that this ransomware was not only interesting but also quite odd:\n\n1. Same as other notorious ransomware variants like REvil, BlackByte also avoids systems with Russian\n\nand ex-USSR languages.\n2. It has a worm functionality similar to RYUK ransomware.\n3. It creates a wake-on-LAN magic packet and sends it to the target host - making sure they are alive\n\nwhen infecting them.\n4. The author hosted the encryption key in a remote HTTP server and in a hidden file with .PNG\n\nextension.\n5. The author lets the program crash if it fails to download the encryption key.\n6. The RSA public key embedded in the body is only used once, to encrypt the raw key to display in the\n\nransom note – that’s it.\n7. The ransomware uses only one symmetric key to encrypt the files.\n\nThe auction site that is linked in the ransom note is also quite odd, see below. The site claims that it has\nexfiltrated data from its victims, but the ransomware itself does not have any exfiltration functionality. So this\nclaim is probably designed to scare their victims into complying.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19: BlackByte's Onion site_\n\n## File Decryption\n\nUnlike other ransomware that may have a unique key in each session, BlackByte uses the same raw key\n(which it downloads) to encrypt files and it uses a symmetric-key algorithm – AES. To decrypt a file, one\nonly needs the raw key to be downloaded from the host. As long as the .PNG file it downloaded remains the\nsame, we can use the same key to decrypt the encrypted files.\n\n[So, we wrote a file decryptor that is available at this link: https://github.com/SpiderLabs/BlackByteDecryptor](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/BlackByteDecryptor)\n\nThe GitHub repository also includes the \"forest.png\" file that has the necessary encryption keys embedded\nin it.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\nDecrypting an encrypted file\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackByteDecryptor forest.png spider.png.blackbyte\n\nDecrypting a directory\n\nBlackByteDecryptor forest.png c:\\temp\n\nThis will decrypt files in the c:\\temp directory, or recursively decrypt a directory:\n\nBlackByteDecryptor forest.png c:\\temp -r\n\n## Launcher\n\n[The initial sample we analyzed can be found at this VirusTotal link and is a JScript launcher file. Upon](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/884e96a75dc568075e845ccac2d4b4ccec68017e6ef258c7c03da8c88a597534/detection)\ninspection, we saw that it utilizes obfuscation techniques to hide its malicious nature. If you want to dig in\n[further on the obfuscation details, and how we deobfuscated it, we posted a separate blog about this.](https://blog.spiderlabs.com/2021/10/blackbyte-ransomware-de-obfuscating-the-obfuscated.html)\nBelow is an overview diagram of the initial execution flow.\n\n_Figure 1: JScript execution flow_\n\nThe main function of the obfuscated Jscript is to decode the main payload and launch it in the memory.\nBelow is the de-obfuscated and the beautified code:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2_\n\n## The DLL Payload\n\nThe payload is a .NET DLL (managed code) that contains a class named jSfMMrZfotrr.\n\n_Figure 3. DLL file .NET assemblies_\n\nThe main purpose of this DLL is the following:\n\n1. Add .JS and .EXE file extensions into Microsoft Defender's exclusion list.\n2. Evade the Microsoft Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) DLL so that it will not scan the loaded\n\nmalware and alert the user for suspicious activity .\n3. Check to see if the following DLLs are present:\n\n- SbieDll.dll (Sandboxie)\n\n- SxIn.dll (Qihoo360 Sandbox)\n\n- Sf2.dll (Avast Antivirus)\n\n\n-----\n\n- snxhk.dll (Avast)\n- cmdvrt32.dll (Comodo Internet)\n\n1. Extract and decode the main payload (BlackByte ransomware) from the resources then execute it in\n\nthe memory.\n\nExtracting the main payload – BlackByte - didn’t come easy, as it turns out that the executable binary is\nencrypted.\n\n_Figure 4. The Ransomware binary is tucked in the .NET assembly resource file named GOor.PVT5._\n\nTo make it easier and bypass analyzing the encryption and obfuscation layer, we simply let the JScript code\nrun using cscript command:\n\ncscript.exe <malicious JScript launcher>\n\nThen we let the malicious .NET assembly run in memory. Afterward, we dumped all the .NET assemblies\n[including the decrypted BlackByte .NET executable. We used a tool called MegaDumper to achieve this.](https://github.com/CodeCracker-Tools/MegaDumper)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. By dumping the CSCRIPT.EXE that executes the malicious script, we can dump all the.NET_\n_assemblies running in its memory space._\n\n_Figure 6: Once dumped, the decrypted .NET assemblies are saves in the drive and we can start analyzing_\n_them._\n\n## BlackByte: Preparing the Infected System\n\nBefore encrypting, BlackByte first prepares the system so that nothing may hamper it from its file encryption\nroutine. During the initialization, the ransomware sets the value of essential fields such as the ransom\nnotes, the encrypted file extension, cryptographic salt, OS name, among others. Victim identification is then\n\n\n-----\n\ngenerated by combining the infected system s processor ID and the volume serial number and hashing\nthem with MD5. The ransomware creates a mutex named Global\\1f07524d-fb13-4d5e-8e5c-c3373860df25\nand terminates if that mutex name already exists.\n\n_Figure 7_\n\nAfterward, it checks if the system language locale is on its list of language codes – as shown below. If the\nsystem default language is on the list, BlackByte terminates:\n\n**BCP 47 Code** **Language** **Language Code**\n\n**hy-AM** Armenian (Armenia) 1067\n\n**az-Cyrl-AZ** Azeri (Cyrillic) - Azerbaijan 2092\n\n**Cy-az-AZ** Azeri (Cyrillic) - Azerbaijan\n\n**Lt-az-AZ** Azeri (Latin) - Azerbaijan 1068\n\n**be-BY** Belarusian - Belarus 1059\n\n**kk-KZ** Kazakh - Kazakhstan 1087\n\n**ky-KZ** Kyrgyz - Kazakhstan\n\n**ky-KZ** Kyrgyz - Kazakhstan\n\n**tt-RU** Tatar - Russia\n\n**ba-RU** Bashkir (Russia)\n\n**sah-RU** Sakha (Russia)\n\n\n-----\n\n**ru-RU** Russian (Russia) 1049\n\n**tg-Cyrl-TJ** Tajik (Cyrillic, Tajikistan) 1064\n\n**uz-Cyrl-UZ** Uzbek (Cyrillic, Uzbekistan) 2115\n\nUzbek (Latin) 1091\n\n**uk-UA** Ukrainian (Ukraine) 1058\n\n**ka-GE** Georgian (Georgia) 1079\n\nTurkmen 1090\n\nThe ransomware also sets its process priority class to above normal and uses SetThreadExecutionState\nAPI to prevent the system from entering sleep. It then removes applications and terminates processes that\ncan hinder the encryption of the target files. Below are the actions it does in the system:\n\nIt enumerates the registry key:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\n\nAnd then deletes the following subkeys:\n\n1. vssadmin.exe\n2. wbadmin.exe\n3. bcdedit.exe\n4. powershell.exe\n5. diskshadow.exe\n6. net.exe\n7. taskkill.exe\n8. wmic.exe\n\nBlackByte terminates Raccine, an anti-ransomware utility, and uninstalls it from the infected system by\nrunning the command:\n\ntaskill.exe /F /IM Raccine.exe\n\ntaskill.exe /F /IM RaccineSettings.exe\n\nschtasks.exe /DELETE /TN \\\"Raccine Rules Updater \\\" /F\n\nIt also deletes any Raccine related registry keys including:\n\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nName = “Raccine Tray”\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Application\\Raccine\n\n\n-----\n\nIt runs a series of SC commands to disable a list of services:\n\nsc.exe config SQLTELEMETRY start = disabled\n\nsc.exe config sc SQLTELEMETRY$ECWDB2 start = disabled\n\nsc.exe config SQLWriter start = disabled\n\nsc.exe config SstpSvc start = disabled\n\nsc.exe config MBAMService start = disabled\n\nsc.exe config wuauserv start = disabled\n\nIt also enables the following services:\n\nDnscache fdPHost\n\nFDResPub SSDPSRV\n\nupnphost RemoteRegistry\n\nIt uses the Microsoft Restart Manager API RmShutdown to terminate the following processes:\n\nagntsvc CNTAoSMgr dbeng50 dbsnmp encsvc\n\nexcel firefox firefoxconfig infopath isqlplussvc\n\nmbamtray msaccess msftesql mspub mydesktopqos\n\nmydesktopservice mysqld mysqld-nt mysqld-opt Ntrtscan\n\nocautoupds ocomm ocssd onenote oracle\n\noutlook PccNTMon powerpnt sqbcoreservice sql\n\nsqlagent sqlbrowser sqlservr sqlwriter steam\n\nsynctime tbirdconfig thebat thebat64 thunderbird\n\ntmlisten visio winword wordpad xfssvccon\n\n\n-----\n\nzoolz anydesk chrome opera msedge\n\nfirefox iexplore explorer winlogon SearchIndexer\n\nwininit SearchApp SearchUI Powershell\n\nThe following living-off-the-land commands are also executed to delete all shadow copies on all volumes,\ndelete Windows restore points, disable controlled folder access, enable network discovery, grant \"everyone\"\nfull access to target drives, delete the recycle bin, enable file and printer sharing, and enable SMB1\nprotocol.\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=c: /on=c: /maxsize=401MB\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=c: /on=c: /maxsize=unbounded\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=d: /on=d: /maxsize=401MB\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=d: /on=d: /maxsize=unbounded\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=e: /on=e: /maxsize=401MB\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=e: /on=e: /maxsize=unbounded\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=f: /on=f: /maxsize=401MB\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=f: /on=f: /maxsize=unbounded\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=g: /on=g: /maxsize=401MB\n\nvssadmin.exe vssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=g: /on=g: /maxsize=unbounded\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=h: /on=h: /maxsize=401MB\n\nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=h: /on=h: /maxsize=unbounded\n\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /all /quiet\npowershell.exe Get-CimInstance Win32_ShadowCopy | Remove-CimInstance\n\npowershell.exe Set-MpPreference -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled\n\ncmd.exe /c rd /s /q %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\\\$Recycle.bin\n\n\n-----\n\ncmd.exe /c rd /s /q D:\\\\$Recycle.bin\n\nnetsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"Network Discovery” new enable=Yes\n\nnetsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"File and Printer Sharing\" new enable=Yes\n\npowershell.exe Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol\n```\n icacls.exe\" \"<DRIVE LETTER>:*\" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q\n\n```\nThe ransomware sets the following registry settings to elevate local privilege, connect mapped drives,\nenable long paths:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n\nLocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy = REG_DWORD:1\n\nEnableLinkedConnections = REG_DWORD:1\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FileSystem\n\nLongPathsEnabled = REG_DWORD:1\n\nBlackByte uses the mountvol.exe command to mount volume names and leverage the Microsoft\nDiscretionary Access Control List tool – icacls.exe to grant the group to “Everyone” full access to the root of\nthe drive.\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\icacls.exe\" \"{DRIVE LETTER}:*\" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q\n\n## BlackByte: Worm\n\nThis ransomware also has a worm capability. It first checks if the file %AppData%\\<Generated Victim ID>\nexists. If this file does not exist, it means that the ransomware has not infected the network yet.\n\n_Figure 8: Once dumped, the decrypted .NET assemblies are saved in the drive and we can start analyzing_\n_them._\n\nWhen the worm function is called, it initially sleeps for 10 seconds then queries at least 1,000 hostnames in\nthe domain from the active directory.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: To get all the computer names in the network, BlackByte attempts to retrieve the_\n_defaultNamingContext from RootDSE from the Active Directory server, then it filters objects in the Active_\n_Directory identifying as computer and fetching a limit of up to 1,000 records._\n\n[It enumerates the returned record of hostnames, sends a wake-on-lan magic packet and then pings the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN#Magic_packet)\ntarget hosts making sure they are alive. Below is the worm routine and execution flow:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Worm routine execution flow_\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackByte then proceeds to infect the host by copying itself to the path\n<hostname>\\c$\\Users\\Public\\obamka.js (if it has admin rights) or <hostname>\\Users\\Public\\obamka.js and\nthen creates a scheduled task in the remote host to execute the file.\n\nschtasks.exe <remotehost> /TN joke /TR \\\"wscript.exe C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\obamka.js\\\" /sc\n```\n once /st 00:00 /RL HIGHEST\n\n```\n```\nschtasks.exe /S <remotehost> /Run /TN joke\n\n```\n\nBlackByte then creates an infection marker file in the target host in the path c:\\Users\\Public\\blockator.\n\n## BlackByte: Encryption Routine\n\nWhat we found interesting about this ransomware, is that it initially downloads a .PNG file from the link\nhxxp://45.9.148.114/forest.png which contains a key to be used later to encrypt the files. If the ransomware\nfails to download the key, it will crash and will save the infected system from getting its files encrypted.\n\n_Figure 11: Fatal Exception Error when the ransomware failed to download the .png file_\n\nThe file it downloaded is not actually a PNG image file, instead:\n\nThe first 40 bytes is the raw key used to encrypt the user's files, this is encrypted with 3DES.\nThe last 32 bytes contain the 3DES key used to decrypt the first 40 bytes raw key.\nThe raw key then goes through a PBKDF2 derivation function to derive the AES 128-bit key and\nInitialization Vector for the AES algorithm used to encrypt the user files.\nThis raw key is also re-encrypted using RSA with a public key embedded in the module and displayed\nin the ransom note.\nThe attacker can decrypt this key using his private key, but this key is the same - provided the user\nalways gets the same “forest.png” file. Presumably, the file forest.png is replaced periodically.\n\nThe first 40 bytes of the PNG file is a key (encrypted in TripleDES) used later for the ransomware’s file\nencryption.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: TripleDES encrypted key in the first 40 bytes of the file_\n\nThe TripleDES key to decrypt the key is found in the last 32 bytes of the PNG file.\n\n_Figure 13: The last 32 bytes of the PNG file as highlighted is the KEY to decrypt the TripleDES encrypted_\n_key_\n\nBelow is the decrypted raw key:\n\n=hQ;d'%44eLHt!W8AU9y?(FO:<swB[F#<F\n\nThis raw key is then re-encrypted with RSA using a public key embedded in the module (shown below) and\nthen after the encryption, the key gets encoded with Base64.\n\n</RSAKeyValue>\n<Modulus>\nwKUX7pbo9XM/Z2gWbVADG8yV7ZklXOSRPv/KvtJHLIBUPvNWgjmKeiIgT3f5h\nCxaxqUzCi0QrrIhVIzA0WM+mPY9CLfIFLhq90v8H/+VezQtqeajO5J4ilDbqut9GH3x0ojVjC\ntF4/Q1Mxk125Af3D8IZQnXAw5uQ/uGXqP8e3E=\n</Modulus>\n<Exponent>AQAB</Exponent>\n</RSAKeyValue>\n\nThe encrypted raw key is replaced in the ransom note's key placeholder where it gets displayed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Ransomnote_\n\nAfter downloading and decrypting the raw key, it will derive the raw key using Rfc2898DeriveBytes\nimplementation with the salt byte-array { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08 } and with 1000\niterations\n\n_Figure 15: Key derivation function_\n\nThe graphic below will help visualize the encryption routine:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Encryption Routine_\n\nThe ransomware will then start enumerating the drives (excluding the CD-ROM drive) and add them to a\nlist. It makes sure it has full control of the target drives by changing its access control to full.\n\nAfter gathering all the drives (local and remote) and shared folders on the remote host, the ransomware will\nstart traversing it and searches for all the target files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17: BlackByte file traversal routine_\n\nIt avoids encrypting files with a system file attribute, and also filenames and file extensions from this list:\n\nFilenames:\n\nobamka.js thumbs.db\n\nntdetect.com ntuser.dat.log\n\nbootnxt bootsect.bak\n\nntldr autoexec.bat\n\nRecycle.Bin iconcache.db\n\nbootmgr bootfont.bin\n\nFile extensions:\n\nmsilog log ldf lock theme\n\nmsi sys wpx cpl adv\n\nmsc scr key ico dll\n\n\n-----\n\nhta deskthemepack nomedia msu rtp\n\nmsp idx ani 386 diagcfg\n\nbin mod ics com hlp\n\nspl nls cab exe diagpkg\n\nicl ocx rom prf themepack\n\nmsstyles icns mpa drv cur\n\ndiagcab cmd shs\n\nIf the ransomware encounters a virtual hard drive file extension .vhd and .vhdx, it will attempt to dismount\nthese drives using a PowerShell command:\n\npowershell.exe Dismount-DiskImage -ImagePath <vhd path>\n\nA target file to be encrypted undergoes file size filtering:\n\nIf the file is greater than 150MB\n\nencrypt the first 50MB and the last 50MB of the file\nIf the file is greater than 15MB\n\nencrypt the first 5MB and the last 5MB of the file\nIf the file is greater than 3MB\n\nencrypt the first 1MB and the last 1MB of the file\nIf the file is less than 3MB\n\nencrypt the whole file\n\nTo encrypt a file, it uses AES symmetric-key algorithm using the RFC2898 derived raw keys from the .png\nfile.\n\nBelow is the code snippet of the file encryption routine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: BlackByte's encryption routine_\n\nIn [BlackByte Ransomware – Part 2, we will show you how we de-obfuscated the JScript launcher,](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/trustwave-blog/blackbyte-ransomware-pt-2-code-obfuscation-analysis/)\ndecompiled the ransomware code, and analyzed more of its inner workings.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Filename** **Description** **SHA256**\n\n\nObamka.js Jscript\nlauncher\n\n\n884e96a75dc568075e845ccac2d4b4ccec68017e6ef258c7c03da8c88a597534\n\n\nforest.png Key file 9bff421325bed6f1989d048edb4c9b1450f71d4cb519afc5c2c90af8517f56f3\n\n\nyk0pdddk BlackByte\nRansomware\n\nvylvz3le.dll BlackByte\nLoader\n\n2edpcniu.dll BlackByte\nLoader\n\n**Network**\n\n\nd3efaf6dbfd8b583babed67046faed28c6132eafe303173b4ae586a2ca7b1e90\n\n92ffb5921e969a03981f2b6991fc85fe45e07089776a810b7dd7504ca61939a3\n\nf8efe348ee2df7262ff855fb3984884b3f53e9a39a8662a6b5e843480a27bd93\n\n\nhxxp://45.9.148.114/forest.png\n\n\n-----",
