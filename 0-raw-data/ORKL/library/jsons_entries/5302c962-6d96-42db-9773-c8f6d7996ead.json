I urgently advise you to apply this Fix-it](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2794220)\nsolution, or to use another browser, until the release of the final patch surely planned for the\n8 January Microsoft Patch Tuesday.\n\nI have some interesting and funny additional information’s regarding the CFR watering hole\n**attack, and I would like to share them with you. But previously I recommend you to read the**\nfollowing analysis done by security companies or independent security researchers:\n\nLet’s start with the analysis of only two samples, “news_14242aa.html” and “Helps.html“.\nThese two samples are quiet interesting, and a complete blog post is enough for them. I will\nanalyze the other samples in dedicated further blog posts.\n\n**news_14242aa.html (545cb268267609910e1312399406cdbc)**\n\n[This sample was extracted from Google cache with a cache date of 7 Dec 2012 14:12:28](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=site:cfr.org&btnG=Recherche+Google&meta=&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=#q=site:cfr.org+news_14242aa.html&hl=en&safe=off&tbo=d&tbas=0&source=lnt&sa=X&psj=1&ei=Xc3eUOnSPMfR4QT8toCoBg&ved=0CBgQpwUoAA&fp=1&bpcl=40096503&biw=1376&bih=739&cad=b&sei=kxzgUL-oE8rb4QSoxYHYDA&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&sei=UG3jUNPBO6Ta4QSlh4DQBA)\nGMT. This sample clearly demonstrate that the compromise of CFR.org wasn’t the 20, or 21\nDecember as mentioned by security companies or medias, but really sooner. The proof is\nstill indexed and in cache of Google.\n\n**Helps.html (a25c13d4edb207e6ce153469c1104223)**\n\nI received this sample, around the 29 December. This file is the equivalent of the first sample\nbut with some modifications, you can see the differences in the following online\ndiff. Additional languages have been added (jp – ru – ko), all the stuffs regarding Microsoft\nOffice documents have been removed (boy or girl), some additional “blank” locations have\nbeen added and the body text has been hide.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow, if you do research on [VirusTotal with this MD5, you can find a relate sample, but with](https://www.virustotal.com/file/e2a61961f96ae2079d38d1c4cfb6703b28f233b2a25b20951376186b8c277e94/analysis/)\nanother filename “config.html” who was submitted the 2012-12-31 18:29:47 UTC. Looks like\ninteresting, but has to be confirmed.\n\nIf you execute a request on urlQuery in order to search all “config.html” file for the last past\nmonth, you will discover a submission, dating from 2012-12-29 22:58:29, for URL\n[“http://www.capstoneturbine.com/_include/config.html” on server 74.62.198.72. If you take a](https://urlquery.net/report.php?id=551220)\nlook at the urlQuery report you can see some “deployJavaPlugin” strings.\n\nThe [Capstone Turbine Corporation company description, make me believe that this company](http://www.capstoneturbine.com/company/)\nprofile could be a choice of quality for targeted attack:\n\nCapstone Turbine Corporation ® is the world’s leading producer of low-emission\nmicroturbine systems, and was first to market with commercially viable microturbine\nenergy products. Capstone Turbine has shipped thousands of Capstone MicroTurbine\nsystems to customers worldwide.\n\n[By doing a Google dork research “site:capstoneturbine.com “_include”” you can see](https://www.google.lu/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&safe=off&tbo=d&sclient=psy-ab&q=site:capstoneturbine.com+%22_include%22&oq=site:capstoneturbine.com+%22_include%22&gs_l=hp.3...254718.261820.0.261928.20.18.1.0.0.0.363.3123.0j14j2j1.17.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.BxgBVk8rSRk&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.1355534169,d.Yms&fp=a256d4f28226d313&bpcl=40096503&ion=1&biw=1050&bih=783)\nsomething strangely similar to CFR.org “news_14242aa.html“ file.\n\n[This page is also cached in google cache, and guess what ? Ho, Ho Ho, CVE-2012-4792 is](https://pastebin.com/q02MFhwF)\nin the house since the 18 December 16:10:40 GMT. So CFR.org was and is not the only\ntarget of this attack !\n\nNow we will try to define the date of compromise of Capstone Turbine Corporation through\n[research on Google by another google dork ““capstoneturbine.com” “_include”“. And we can](https://www.google.lu/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&ie=UTF-8#q=%22capstoneturbine.com%22+%22_include%22&hl=en&safe=off&tbo=d&ei=GGrjUJ-GIsnk4QT9mYGwAg&start=10&sa=N&filter=0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&fp=a256d4f28226d313&bpcl=40096503&biw=1436&bih=783&ion=1)\nfind some interesting informations 😉\n\n[On support.clean-mx.de we can discover that the same “/_include/config.html” URL was](http://support.clean-mx.de/clean-mx/viruses.php?id=2251432)\nindexed since 2012-09-19 04:31:01. But what is awesome is the evidence attached to this\nsubmission hoho it is [CVE-2012-4969 I discovered in September 🙂 “Grumgog.swf” is in the](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/09/17/microsoft-internet-explorer-execcommand-vulnerability-metasploit-demo/)\nhouse.\n\n\n-----\n\nMy conclusions are:\n\nCFR.org was comprised since minimum beginning December.\nCVE-2012-4792 was present on CFR.org since minimum beginning December.\nCVE-2012-4792 was also used to target visitors of another company named Capstone\nTurbine Corporation.\nCVE-2012-4792 was present on Capstone Turbine Corporation since minimum 18\nDecember.\nCapstone Turbine Corporation was also used to spread CVE-2012-4969 and this since\nmid-September.\nPotentially Capstone Turbine Corporation is compromised since minimum beginning\nSeptember\nPotentially the guys behind CVE-2012-4969 and CVE-2012-4792 are the same.\n\nBut, there is always a but in a story, take a look at the first submission for Capstone Turbine\nCorporation in August, “http://www.capstoneturbine.com/_flash/videos_native/exploit.html “.\nImagine 🙂\n\n**Update 1 – 2013-01-02 1:30 am:**\n\nJindrich Kubec director of Threat Intelligence at avast! confirm presence of CVE-20124969 in September on Capstone Turbine Corporation.\n\n[@eromang I wrote to Capstone Turbine on 19th Sep about the Flash exploit stuff they](https://twitter.com/eromang)\nwere hosting. They never replied. And also not fixed 😉\n\n[— Jindrich Kubec (@Jindroush) January 2, 2013](https://twitter.com/Jindroush/status/286268899010416640)\n\n\n-----",
