While it might seem implausible for criminal groups to be\nsharing resources, we found these groups had a connection that is enabled by a fourth; a threat\nactor we have dubbed Zebra2104, which we believe to be an Initial Access Broker (IAB).\n\nIn this post, we will discuss what led us to these findings, what an IAB is, and how each piece fits\ninto the puzzle. Once we look at each piece in context, we can better assess the full ramifications\nof these discoveries, and project what is yet to come.\n\n### Introduction\n\nWhen conducting research for our book, “Finding Beacons in the Dark: A Guide to Cyber Threat\n_Intelligence,” we stumbled upon a domain that piqued our interest due to its similarity to a naming_\nconvention that we’d seen in a previous threat hunt.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis single domain led us down a path where we would uncover multiple ransomware attacks, and\nan APT command-and-control (C2). The path also revealed what we believe to be the\ninfrastructure of an IAB: Zebra2104.\n\nIABs typically first gain entry into a victim’s network, then sell that access to the highest bidder on\nunderground forums located in the dark web. Later, the winning bidder will often deploy\nransomware and/or other financially motivated malware within the victim’s organization, depending\non the objectives of their campaign.\n\nThis discovery presented a great opportunity for us to understand the attribution of IABs.\nPerforming intelligence correlation can help us build a clearer picture of how these disparate threat\ngroups create partnerships and share resources to further enhance their nefarious goals.\n\nAs we delved into and peeled off each overlapping layer throughout our investigation, it appeared\nat times that we were merely scratching the surface of such collaborations. There is undoubtedly a\nveritable cornucopia of threat groups working in cahoots, far beyond those mentioned in this blog.\n\nIn this first installment, we will document the tip of this iceberg. A more comprehensive set of\nfindings will come in a follow-up piece in the near future.\n\nNow, let’s explore what we found!\n\n### It All Begins with Cobalt Strike\n\nIn April of 2021, we observed the domain trashborting[.]com serving Cobalt Strike Beacons. We\nalso identified multiple Beacons containing differing configuration data that was reaching out to this\nsame domain, during April and August of this year.\n\nOne such Beacon served from the IP 87.120.37[.]120 had trashborting[.]com specified as the C2\nserver in its configuration.\n\n**IP** **Country** **ASN** **ASN Number**\n\n**87.120.37.120** Bulgaria Neterra Ltd AS34224\n\n_Table 1 – Trashborting[.]com IP address_\n\nThe domain trashborting[.]com had previously resolved to this IP address, as well as the\nneighboring IP 87.120.37[.]119.\n\nThese IP addresses had also hosted two domains with the .us Top Level Domain (TLD):\n\nlionarivv[.]us\nokergeeliw[.]us\n\n### Rediscovering Malicious Spam Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nEach of the aforementioned domains had a mail server and associated MX record, meaning they\nhad the capability to send emails en masse. By examining the WHOIS information for these\nservers, we discovered that both domains were registered on 2020-09-12 by the email address\n_georgesdesjardins285[at}xperi[.]link. By digging into the domain registrant information, we found_\nthat this email address had registered eight additional .us domains on the same date.\n\nThese domains popped up previously in a Microsoft blog titled: “What tracking an attacker’s email\n_infrastructure tells us about persistent cybercriminal operations.”_\n\nThe Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team found that these servers had been serving\n[malspam that resulted in varying ransomware payloads, such as Dridex, which we were able to](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/08/threat-thursday-ta575-dridex)\ncorroborate.\n\n**Type** **IOC**\n\n**Domain** bertolinnj[.]us\n\n**Domain** eixirienhj[.]us\n\n**Domain** auswalzenna[.]us\n\n**Domain** megafonasgc[.]us\n\n**Domain** zensingergy[.]us\n\n**Domain** infuuslx[.]us\n\n**Domain** mipancepezc[.]us\n\n**Domain** kavamennci[.]us\n\n_Table 2 - Additional .us domains_\n\nThe interlinking relationships between all these domains can be seen in Figure 1 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 - Malspam distribution_\n\n### Dridex Malspam\n\nTwo domains of particular interest to us were kavamennci[.]us and zensingergy[.]us. These were\ninvolved in a phishing campaign targeting Australian real estate companies and state government\ndepartments in September of 2020, which are evidenced as follows.\n\nThe first spam-mail was sent from an address coming from the kavamennci[.]us domain, and it\nappears to target employees at one of the Australia's largest property groups. The mail was titled\n“Your Transaction was Approved 697169IR54253” and it contained an embedded hyperlink that\ndecoded to “hxxps[:]//mail[.]premiumclube[.]org[.]br/zpsxxla.php.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 - Phishing email targeting employees at one of Australia’s largest property groups_\n\nThe second email was directed at an Australian government agency, and titled “Payment\n_Notification-0782704YX50906.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 - Phishing email targeting an Australian Government Agency_\n\nSent from an address originating from the “zensingergy[.]us” domain, this email contained a similar\nembedded link: “hxxps[:]//magesty[.]in-expedition[.]com/zxlbw.php.”\n\nIn addition, the last portion of the embedded malicious links — “zpsxxla.php” and “zxlbw.php” —\nalso appear in the Microsoft blog, and are mentioned as part of a Dridex campaign from September\n2020 that was [described by Microsoft as follows:](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/01/what-tracking-an-attacker-email-infrastructure-tells-us-about-persistent-cybercriminal-operations/)\n\n“These Dridex campaigns utilized an Emotet loader and initial infrastructure for hosting, allowing\n_the attackers to conduct a highly modular email campaign that delivered multiple distinct links to_\n_compromised domains. These domains employed heavy sandbox evasion and are connected by a_\n_series of PHP patterns ending in a small subset of options: zxlbw.php, yymclv.php, zpsxxla.php, or_\n_app.php.”_\n\nThis is significant because it demonstrates the power of open-source intelligence (OSINT) and\nthreat hunting. Initially, we started off with one domain (trashborting[.]com), which helped us to\nunravel other threat actors that we will look at in more detail later. Although Dridex is not the target\nof this paper, it is certainly a noteworthy find to mention.\n\n### Peering Down the Intelligence Rabbit Hole\n\nThe trashborting.com domain was registered with a ProtonMail email address\n(ivan.odencov1985[at]protonmail[.]com) and contained Russian WHOIS registrant information:\n\n**Type** **IOC**\n\nRegistrar PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com\n\nDomain Status client delete prohibited\n\nclient update prohibited\n\nclient delete prohibited\n\nclient hold\n\nEmail Ivan.odencov1985[at]protonmail[.]com (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nName Ivan (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nOrganization \nStreet \n\n-----\n\nCity Moscow (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nState Moscow (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nPostal Code 123066 (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nCountry RU (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nPhone +7.993216690 (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nName Servers ns1.entrydns.net\n\nns2.entrydns.net\n\nns3.entrydns.net\n\nns4.entrydns.net\n\n_Table 3 - Trashborting WHOIS information_\n\nThis email address was also used to register two additional sister domains on the same date: July\n[17, 2020. Both had been observed serving Cobalt Strike Beacon.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/10/blackberry-shines-spotlight-on-evolving-cobalt-strike-threat-in-new-book)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 - Trashborting and sister domains_\n\nIn March of 2021, Sophos listed supercombinating[.]com as an indicator of compromise (IOC).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 - Sophos MountLocker IOCs_\n\nThe MountLocker group is a financially motivated threat group that offers a Ransomware-as-aService (RaaS) model; they have been active since July of 2020. As has become the trend with\nrecent ransomware operators, MountLocker employs double extortion tactics. This means that the\nmalware operators exfiltrate sensitive documents and data from the victim prior to encryption, then\nthreaten to publish said data on the dark web should their ransom demands not be met.\n\n[Such attacks typically leverage Cobalt Strike Beacon to both spread laterally and propagate the](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cobalt_strike)\nMountLocker ransomware within the victim network. In this instance, this is done via\nsupercombinating[.]com.\n\n[Sophos has supposed that the MountLocker group has links to, or has in fact become, the recently](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/94954-sophos-identifies-connection-between-mount-locker-and-astro-locker-team-ransomware)\nemerged AstroLocker group. This is because one of the group’s ransomware binaries has been\nlinked to a support site of AstroLocker. It’s possible that this group is trying to shed any notoriety or\n\n\n-----\n\nbaggage that it had garnered through its previous malicious activities.\n\n[For additional information, you can check out our blog on MountLocker, which sheds further light](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/12/mountlocker-ransomware-as-a-service-offers-double-extortion-capabilities-to-affiliates)\non affiliate operations and double extortion capabilities.\n\n### MountLocker Activity\n\nAt this point, we noticed that supercombinating[.]com had also resolved to the IP address\n_91.92.109[.]174, which itself had hosted the domain mentiononecommon[.]com._ Both domains\nresolved to this IP in an alternating fashion between April and November of 2020, as illustrated in\nthe image below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 - Domain resolution_\n\nThis alternating resolution timeline can be seen below:\n\n_Figure 7 - Alternating IP resolution_\n\nSo, what does this mean, and where does mentiononecommon[.]com fit into the puzzle? The\nanswer to this question requires a little more background information to paint a clearer picture.\nAdditional OSINT led to us uncover links between mentiononecommon[.]com and the APT group\nknown as StrongPity. Before we discuss those connections, let’s look at who the StrongPity group\nare, and what they are known for.\n\n### Why Hello There, StrongPity!\n\nStrongPity, aka Promethium (Microsoft), is an APT group that has been operational as far back as\n[2012. It was previously alleged that this group is Turkish state-sponsored, though this is](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/promethium-extends-with-strongpity3.html)\nunconfirmed.\n\n[Their modus operandi has typically been to use watering hole attacks to deliver Trojanized](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/newly-identified-strongpity-operations)\nversions of various commonly used utilities. To accomplish these attacks, a combination of\nimitation websites and redirects are employed to lure the victim into a false sense of security.\n[Utilities such as WinRAR, Internet Download Manager, and CCleaner have all been victimized in](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2018/10/whack-a-mole-the-impact-of-threat-intelligence-on-adversaries)\nthe past to deliver the group’s malware.\n\n[The scope of their activities includes victims based across several continents, as seen in Figure 8](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/promethium-extends-with-strongpity3.html)\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 - Countries targeted by StrongPity_\n\nIn June of 2020, Cisco’s Talos Intelligence reported mentiononecommon[.]com as a StrongPity C2\nserver. The domain also served three files related to StrongPity, one of which was the previously\nmentioned Trojanized version of the Internet Download Manager utility.\n\n**SHA256** **Filename**\n\n**c936e01333e3260547a8c319d9cfc1811ba5793e182d0688db679ec2b30644c5** Installer.exe\n\n**e843af007ac3f58e26d5427e537cdbddf33d118c79dfed831eee1ffcce474569** SecurityHost.exe\n\n**8844d234d9e18e29f01ff8f64db70274c02953276a2cd1a1a05d07e7e1feb55c** SecurityHost.exe\n\n_Table 4 - mentiononecommon[.]com StrongPity samples_\n\nFurthermore, the domain mentiononecommon[.]com was registered to the email address\ntimofei66[at]protonmail[.]com, which also has WHOIS registrant information pointing to Russia.\n\nWhile this is far from definitive evidence, it is certainly a notable similarity.\n\n**Type** **IOC**\n\nWHOIS Server whois.namecheap.com\n\nRegistrar NameCheap, Inc.\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain Status clientTransferProhibited\n\nEmail **Timofei66[at]protonmail[.]com (registrant, admin, tech)**\n\nName Timofei Solomin (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nOrganization \nStreet YU.gagarina, bld. 12/2, appt. 76 (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nCity Ufa (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nState Respublika Bashkortostan (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nPostal Code 49875 (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nCountry RUSSIAN FEDERATION (registrant, admin, tech)\n\nPhone 77347382066 (registrant, admin, tech)\n\n_Table 5 - mentiononecommon[.]com WHOIS registrant information_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 - mentiononecommon[com] serving StrongPity binaries_\n\nAt this point, we started to suspect that MountLocker and StrongPity may have worked together in\nsome capacity. This theory seemed unlikely, as their motivations did not appear to align. Despite\nthe improbability of the hypothesis, we set out to see whether we could prove it, and we stumbled\nupon yet another curious find.\n\n### Three Groups — Is That All?\n\n[Through a tweet from The DFIR Report, we saw that more ransomware was deployed from](https://twitter.com/pmelson/status/1290030989679329280?lang=en)\nsupercombinating[.]com, but it was not MountLocker as we had seen previously. This time, Phobos\n[ransomware took its place, which we confirmed through the linked Any.Run sandbox report.](https://app.any.run/tasks/0e5e8db2-82fe-43e7-8450-485ecd0057f7/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis raised more questions. Were MountLocker and Phobos possibly related? Were two different\nransomware groups operating from the same infrastructure? Was this a delivery system? Was an\nIAB playing a part in all this?\n\n_Figure 10 – Tweet by Paul Melson re: Cobalt Strike Beacon relating to supercombinating[.]com_\n\n_Figure 11 – Tweet by The DFIR Report re: Cobalt Strike Phobos deployment via_\n_supercombinating[.]com_\n\n[Phobos is a ransomware variant that was first seen in early 2019. It is thought to be based on the](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/09/threat-thursday-phobos-ransomware)\nDharma ransomware family. Unlike a lot of other ransomware operators that cast for larger “whale”sized organizations, Phobos has been seen angling for small-to-medium-sized organizations\n[across a variety of industries, with its average ransom payment received being around $54,000 in](https://www.coveware.com/phobos-ransomware-payment)\nJuly of 2021.\n\nA possible insight as to why the authors chose the name for their ransomware is that Phobos was\nthe god of fear in ancient Greek mythology. Few malware groups are so direct about the feeling\nthey seem to want to instill in their victims\n\n\n-----\n\n### A Mysterious Fourth Group Emerges\n\nThis new information presented a bit of a conundrum. If MountLocker owned the infrastructure,\nthen there would be a slim chance of another ransomware operator also working from it, although it\nhas happened before.\n\n[Back in June 2020, the Maze threat actor group added stolen files to its leak site. However, upon](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-team-up-to-form-extortion-cartel/)\n[visiting the leak site, the stolen data was actually provided by the LockBit threat actor group. When](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/08/threat-spotlight-lockbit-2-0-ransomware-takes-on-top-consulting-firm)\nBleeping Computer reached out to Maze for more information regarding the implied partnership\nbetween them and LockBit, the Maze group replied with the following:\n\n\"In a few days another group will emerge on our news website, we all see in this cooperation the\n_way leading to mutual beneficial outcome, for both actor groups and companies. Even more, they_\n_use not only our platform to post the data of companies, but also our experience and reputation,_\n_building the beneficial and solid future. We treat other groups as our partners, not as our_\n_competitors. Organizational questions is [sic] behind every successful business.”_\n\nIn several instances, a delay was observed between an initial compromise using Cobalt Strike and\nfurther [ransomware being deployed. Based on these factors, we can infer that the infrastructure is](https://twitter.com/pmelson/status/1290037432264601600?s=20)\nnot that of StrongPity, MountLocker, or Phobos, but of a fourth group that has facilitated the\noperations of the former three. This is either done by providing initial access, or by providing\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS).\n\n### IABs: the Lowdown\n\nAn IAB performs the first step in the kill chain of many attacks; this is to say they gain access into a\nvictims' network through exploitation, phishing, or other means.\n\n_Figure 12 - IAB’s operation workflow_\n\nOnce they have established a foothold (i.e., a reliable backdoor into the victim network), they then\nlist their access in underground forums on the dark web, advertising their wares in hopes of finding\na prospective buyer.\n\n[The price for access ranges from as little as $25, going up to thousands of dollars. Typically, the](https://ke-la.com/kelas-100-over-100-september2020-in-network-access-sales/)\nmore annual revenue that the target organization generates, the higher the price an IAB charges\nfor “access.”\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon successful sale agreement, the winning bidders will generally deploy their malware of choice.\nThis can be anything from ransomware to infostealing malware, and everything in between.\n\nWe believe that our three threat actors – MountLocker, Phobos and StrongPity, in this instance –\nsourced their access through these means.\n\n### Additional IAB Infrastructure?\n\nWe saw two new domains registered on July 21, 2021, both of which resolved to the same IP\naddress of 87.120.37[.]120:\n\nticket-one-two[.]com\nbooking-sales[.]com\n\n_Figure 13 - IP resolution_\n\nThat is the same IP that trashborting[.]com resolved to, as well as lionarivv[.]us!\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14 - 87.120.37[.]120 reverse resolutions_\n\nTicket-one-two[.]com has not been used at the time of writing, however its counterpart, bookingsales[.]com, had served one specific item of note; a tiny, 13KB portable executable (PE) file that\nupon inspection proved to be a shellcode loader.\n\nThis loader turned out to be loading a shellcode Cobalt Strike DNS stager, which is used to\ndownload a Cobalt Strike Beacon via DNS TXT records.\n\n### Taking a Closer Look at the Loader/DNS Stager\n\nThe shellcode loader expects a specific command-line argument in order to execute properly,\nwhich it hashes and then checks against the value 0xB6E35C. Fortunately, we can just patch a\ncomparison and proceed without a match.\n\nThe file then allocates RWX memory using VirtualAlloc, and then decodes data stored within the\nbinary into memory, using a combination of subtraction and division operations – no special\ncryptography necessary here.\n\n_Figure 15 – Subtraction and division decoding loop_\n\nThe resulting data is a shellcode blob, which we can identify based on the initial bytes FC E8 89 00\n00 00, a fairly typical opcode sequence for shellcode.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16 - Resulting shellcode_\n\nDisassembling the shellcode in the disassembly tool IDA, we can immediately identify a new\ndomain that appears to be trying to masquerade as a DNS name-server:\n\n_Figure 17 - A new URL attempting to look like a name server_\n\nWe can also see what appear to be 4-byte hex values being pushed onto the stack before a call.\nThis is indicative of Windows API import name hashing, a common technique to masquerade the\nloading of API calls from identification during analysis. This can be seen in Figure 20, where\n[C99CC96A is pushed onto the stack before a call to ebp.](https://practicalmalwareanalysis.com/2012/04/03/all-about-ebp/)\n\nWe then see that it performs a DNS query on the URL using DnsQueryA.\n\n_Figure 18 - Using DnsQuery_A to query the website’s DNS records_\n\nOnce it receives a DNS response, it parses out the TXT Record from the DNS response and\nchecks its length, as shown in Figure 19.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19 - Extracting the TXT record length and data from the DnsQueryA result_\n\nThis behavior is typical of a DNS stager; it pulls down a later stage payload via the DNS TXT\nrecords, abusing the DNS protocol in an attempt to be stealthy. This is also why the domain name\nwas set to masquerade as a DNS name server.\n\nWhen we look at the Cobalt Strike Malleable C2 documentation, we can see that the URL above in\nFigure 17 uses a strikingly similar domain in their example. For that reason, we believe this to be a\nCobalt Strike DNS stager that will download a Cobalt Strike Beacon upon successful execution.\n\n_Figure 20 – A striking similarity to the Cobalt Strike DNS server example from the developer’s_\n_documentation_\n\n### One More Thing, Before You Go!\n\n\n-----\n\nNow that we ve seen the potential IAB group infrastructure in all its glory, do you notice anything\nabout the IPs discussed here?\n\nAll the domains mentioned in this paper at one time resolved to IPs that were provided by the\nsame Bulgarian Autonomous System Numbers (ASN), which belongs to Neterra Ltd.\n\nThis is not to say we believe the threat actor to be Bulgarian, but that all their infrastructure is\nhosted with one specific company. Furthermore, Neterra isn’t known to be a bulletproof hosting\nprovider; it’s more likely that it’s being abused to facilitate this malicious activity.\n\nThe fact that all these IPs are on the same ASN helps us bind together the theory that this is in fact\nall the work of one threat group, underpinning the operation of the groups it sells its access to.\n\n_Figure 21 - Bulgarian IP addresses on the same ASN_\n\n### Finding Beacons in the Dark\n\nFor those of you interested, here’s a shameless plug for our new book “Finding Beacons in the\n_Dark: A Guide to Cyber Threat Intelligence,” which the BlackBerry Research & Threat Intelligence_\nTeam has lovingly crafted over the course of this year.\n\nIn the book, we demonstrate our Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) lifecycle, and show how you can\nbuild your own automation system to hunt for threats. In this case, that threat would be the Cobalt\nStrike Team Server.\n\nWe also give you an in-depth look at Beacon configuration and their Malleable C2 profiles, and\nreveal insights, trends, and discoveries from over 48,000 Beacons and 6,000 unique Team\nServers.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, we show you the power of intelligence correlation that can be gleaned from datasets\nsuch as these, including how it can be used to:\n\nBuild profiles of threat actors\nBroaden knowledge of existing threat groups\nTrack both ongoing and new threat actor campaigns\n\nThe end result is that you can then:\n\nProvide actionable intelligence to SOC analysis, IR teams and investigators\nReduce “alert fatigue”\nImprove threat detection\nFine-tune security solutions and services\n\n### Conclusions\n\nAs is the case with many cyber investigations in today’s threat landscape, this journey began with\nthe analysis of a Cobalt Strike Beacon and the data contained within its configuration. The\npresence of a single domain – trashborting[.]com – along with both its current and historical\nresolution information, led us to uncover links to many different campaigns and a new group that\nthe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team named, and continues to track, as Zebra2104. This\nname stems from the use of initial access services that, as a byproduct, allow for threat actors to\n“hide in the herd.”\n\nOne such campaign was the malspam infrastructure previously documented by Microsoft, which\nwas seen to serve an assortment of malware – from ransomware to infostealers – and many more\nin between. This same infrastructure had also been observed waging a phishing campaign that\ntargeted Australian entities, both in the governmental and private sector, in September of 2020.\n\nWhen we delved deeper, we found two sister domains that led us down further intelligence\navenues, to ultimately identifying both a MountLocker and a Phobos intrusion from the same\ndomain.\n\nWe then identified another domain sharing a past IP resolution, linked to the StrongPity APT group\nby Talos Intelligence in June of 2020.\n\nWith three seemingly unrelated threat groups using and sharing overlapping infrastructure, we\nasked ourselves the question, “What is the most plausible explanation for these peculiar links?”\n(Especially as these groups’ motives didn’t seem to align.)\n\nWe concluded that this was not the work of the three groups together, but of a fourth player; an\nInitial Access Broker we dubbed Zebra2104, which provided the initial access into victim\nenvironments.\n\nThe interlinking web of malicious infrastructure seen throughout this research has shown that, in a\nmanner that mirrors the legitimate business world, cybercrime groups are in some cases run not\nunlike multinational organizations. They create partnerships and alliances to help advance their\n\n\n-----\n\ngoals. If anything, it is safe to assume that these threat group business partnerships are going to\nbecome even more prevalent in future.\n\nTo counter this, it is only via the tracking, documenting, and sharing of intelligence in relation to\nthese groups (and many more) that the wider security community can monitor and defend against\nthem. This cooperation will continue to further our collective understanding of how cybercriminals\noperate.\n\nIf the bad guys work together, so should we!\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats, providing\nintelligence analysis for the benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\nBack\n\n\n-----",
