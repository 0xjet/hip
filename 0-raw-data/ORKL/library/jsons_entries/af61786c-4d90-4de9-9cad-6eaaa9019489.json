By\nidentifying and focusing on adversary techniques – especially those which\nwill be required in any intrusion event – ICS defenders can achieve an\nadvantageous position with respect to identifying and monitoring future\nattacks. This report seeks to inform ICS defenders and asset owners on\nnot just known attacks, but to provide an overview for how an adversary\nmust and will operate in this environment moving forward. By adopting\na threat-centric defensive approach, defenders can mitigate not just the\nadversaries currently known, but future malicious actors as well.\n\n###### Joe Slowik\n\nAdversary Hunter | Dragos, Inc.\n\n\n-----\n\nPERSPECTIVE\n\n\n###### | INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM THREATS\n 2017 ICS THREAT REVIEW\n\n 2017 was a watershed year in industrial control systems (ICS) security largely due to\n\n the discovery of new capabilities and a significant increase in ICS threat activity groups.\n\n Cybersecurity risks to the safe and reliable operation of industrial control systems have\n\n never been greater. While numerous, incidental infections occur in industrial networks\n\n on a regular basis, ICS-specific or ICS-tailored malware is rarer.\n\nrior to 2017 only three families of ICS-specific malware were known: STUXNET, BLACKENERGY\n2, and HAVEX. In 2017 the world learned of two new ICS-specific malware samples: TRISIS and\n\n###### P\n\nCRASHOVERRIDE. Both of these samples led to industry firsts. CRASHOVERRIDE was the first\nmalware to ever specifically target and disrupt electric grid operations and led to operational\noutages in Kiev, Ukraine in 2016 (although it was not definitively discovered until 2017). TRISIS is\nthe first malware to ever specifically target and disrupt safety instrumented systems (SIS), and\nis the first malware to ever specifically target, or accept as a potential consequence, the loss of\nhuman life. The impact of these events cannot be understated.\n\nThe number of adversaries targeting control systems and their investment in ICS-specific capabilities\nis only growing. There are now five current, active groups targeting ICS systems – far more than our\ncurrent biases with respect to the skill, dedication, and resources required for ICS operations would\nhave us believe possible. These events and continued activity will only drive a hidden arms race for\nother state and non-state actors to mature equivalent weapons to affect industrial infrastructure and\nensure parity against possible adversaries.\n\nWe regrettably expect ICS operational losses and likely safety events to continue into 2018 and the\nforeseeable future.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### | 2017 ICS THREATS\n A SUMMARY\n\n2017 featured multiple, concerning developments within the ICS security space. On a general\nlevel, wormable ransomware such as WannaCry and NotPetya provided notice to ICS owners\nand operators that industrial networks are far more connected to the IT environment than\nmany realized. While significant and – for some organizations – costly, 2017 also featured some\ntargeted events led by activity groups focused exclusively on the ICS environment.\n\nPreviously, defenders perceived ICS threat actors as rare with significant technical limitations\nor hurdles to overcome. But 2017 demonstrated – either because ICS is an increasingly enticing\ntarget, or because researchers and defenders are merely ‘looking harder’ – that these groups\nare more common than previously thought. Toward that end, Dragos identified five active, ICSfocused groups that displayed various levels of activity throughout 2017. While only one has\ndemonstrated an apparent capability to impact ICS networks through ICS-specific malware\ndirectly, all have engaged in at least reconnaissance and intelligence gathering surrounding the\nICS environment.\n\nOverall, the scope and extent of malicious activity either directly targeting or gathering information\non ICS networks increased significantly throughout 2017.\n\n###### As a result of these events, Dragos has been able to analyze and develop strategies\n\n for defending and mitigating various types of attack against ICS assets.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### | NEW ICS-FOCUSED MALWARE\n\n2017 witnessed a dramatic expansion in ICS security activity and awareness. During the year,\nDragos identified and analyzed CRASHOVERRIDE, responsible for the Ukraine power outage\nevent that occurred in December of 2016, and then discovered and analyzed TRISIS, the first ICS\nmalware designed to target industrial safety systems in November. Considering that defenders\nknew of only three ICS-focused malware samples before 2017 – STUXNET (pre-2010),\nBLACKENERGY2 (2012), and HAVEX (2013), the emergence and discovery of two more this year\nindicates that adversaries are focusing more effort and resources on ICS targeting, and those\ncapabilities are expanding.\n###### | TRADITIONAL IT MALWARE CRIPPLING OPERATIONAL NETWORKS\n\nEarly 2017 saw the release of the EternalBlue vulnerability (MS17-010) and the subsequent\nWannaCry ransomware worm. The infection of operational networks with this ransomware\nand operational disruption illustrated the symbiotic relationship between the two networks.\nWhile engineers and operations staff have long held the separation between “business” and\n“operational” environments as the ICS model, the border is increasingly permeable and therefore\noperational ICS networks are facing traditional business threats.\n\nClosely following the WannaCry ransomware adversaries launched NotPetya. What was unique\nis that this was a wiper masquerading as ransomware appearing to initially target Ukraine\nbusiness and financial sectors. In addition to weaponizing the EternalBlue exploit, NotPetya\nleveraged credential capture and replay to provide multiple means of propagation, resulting in\nrapid spreading to organizations well-removed from Ukrainian business sectors. Perhaps the\nmost sobering example is Maersk, which is estimated to have lost up to $300 million USD while\nalso having to rebuild and replace most of its IT and operations network.[1]\n\nTo combat malware infection events such as the above examples, Dragos pursues ‘commodity’,\nnon- ICS-focused malware through the MIMICS project: Malware In Modern ICS Environments. By\naggressively hunting for standard IT threats that can pose a specific danger to ICS environments,\nDragos works to provide early warning and defensive guidance on potentially overlooked threats.\n###### | ADVERSARIES STAYING BUSY: ICS-FOCUSED ACTIVITY\n\nDragos currently tracks five activity groups targeting ICS environments: either with an ICSspecific capability, such as CRASHOVERRIDE or with an intention to gather information and\nintelligence on ICS-related networks and organizations. These groups have remained relatively\nconstant regarding overall activity throughout the year, and Dragos is confident that additional\nunknown events have occurred.\n\n1\n[https://www.itnews.com.au/news/maersk-had-to-reinstall-all-it-systems-after-notpetya-infection-481815](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/maersk-had-to-reinstall-all-it-systems-after-notpetya-infection-481815)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nAn ICS intelligence-driven approach to threat intelligence is not universal. Indicators of compromise\n\nare not intelligence and will not save any organization. Organizations must understand and consume\n\n\n**DETECTION-IN-DEPTH**\nJust as defense-in-depth is a necessary\ncomponent of modern cybersecurity,\ndetection-in-depth must become a necessary\ncomponent across all industrial control levels.\nEnhanced monitoring must especially Include\nany permeable “barriers” such as the IT-OT\nnetwork gap. ICS networks are increasingly\nconnected not only to the IT network but\nalso directly to vendor networks and external\ncommunication sources leaving monitoring of\nthe IT environments alone entirely inefficient.\n\n**ICS-SPECIFIC INVESTIGATIONS**\nIn the event of a breach or disruption there\n\nmust be ICS-specific investigation capabilities\n\nand ICS-specific incident response plans.\n\nThis is the only effective way of identifying\n\nroot cause analysis and reducing mean time\n\nto recovery in the operations environments\n\nwhen facing industrial specific threats.\n\n\n###### | RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n\n**ASSUME BREACH**\nDisruptive ICS-specific malware is real,\ntraditional IT threats now regularly cross\nthe “IT-OT” divide, and ICS knowledgeable\nactivity groups are targeting industrial\ninfrastructure directly instead of just the\nIT networks of industrial companies.\nGone are the days of protection via a\nsegmented network – detection is the\nfirst component of an assume- breach\nmodel – you can only respond to what\nyou can see.\n\n**RESILIENCE AGAINST CYBER ATTACK**\nResiliency analysis and engineering\n\nsurrounding industrial processes must\n\ninclude cyber-attacks. For example,\n\nsafety systems must be designed and\n\noperated with the understanding that\n\nthey may now be purposefully attacked\n\nand undermined.\n\n\n2\n\n\nTo understand ICS threat intelligence read the Dragos whitepaper “Industrial Control Threat Intelligence”\nhtt //d / di /I d t i l C t l Th t I t lli Whit df\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2017\n\n# ICS THREATS\n###### IN DETAIL\n\n\n-----\n\n###### | CRASHOVERRIDE\n\nAlthough taking place in late December 2016, the ICS\nsecurity community did not fully understand the extent\nand significance of the 2016 Ukrainian power outage\nuntil later in 2017. After identifying samples, Dragos\ndetermined that specifically-tailored malware caused the\n2016 event by manipulating the breakers at the target\nsubstation in Ukraine.\n\nAt the time, this represented only the second instance\nwhere malware was utilized to directly impact an ICS\ndevice or process with little human intervention – the\nother example being the Stuxnet worm. In this case, the\nadversary developed a modular attack framework that\ncombined a reasonably protocol-compliant manipulation\nprogram to create an ICS impact (opening breakers\nto generate a power outage), with malicious wiper\nfunctionality to impede and delay system recovery.\n\n###### Further investigation identified a distinct activity group behind the CRASHOVERRIDE\n\n event, as both a developer and attacker: ELECTRUM. As detailed below, ELECTRUM\n\n is assessed to be a highly sophisticated, well-resourced activity group that remains\n\n active.\n\nDefenders lack any knowledge of CRASHOVERRIDE itself or similar capabilities used after the\nDecember 2016 event. While CRASHOVERRIDE, as deployed in the Ukraine attack, is not capable\nof impacting environments dissimilar to the equipment and protocol setup at the target utility,\nthe framework and method of operations deployed provide an example for other adversaries to\nfollow. Examples of new ‘tradecraft’ to emerge from CRASHOVERRIDE include: leveraging ICS\nprotocols to create a malicious impact; creating modular malware frameworks designed to work\nwith multiple protocols; and incorporating automatically-deployed wiper functionality chained to\nan ICS impact.\n\nThus, even if CRASHOVERRIDE itself cannot be used again outside of very narrow circumstances,\nthe tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by it can be adapted to new\nenvironments. By identifying these TTPs and building defenses around them, organizations can\nprepare themselves for the next CRASHOVERRIDE-like attack, rather than focusing exclusively\non the specific events from December 2016 leaving the enterprise open and undefended against\neven minor variations in the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### | TRISIS\n\nTRISIS is the third-recorded ICS attack executed via malware, the previous two being Stuxnet\nand CRASHOVERRIDE (see above). TRISIS is a specifically-targeted program designed to upload\nnew ladder logic to Schneider Electric Triconex safety systems. The malware utilizes a speciallycrafted search and upload routine to enable overwriting ladder logic within memory based on a\ndeep understanding of the Triconex product.\n\nUnique compared to past ICS events, TRISIS targeted safety instrumented systems (SIS), those\ndevices used to ensure system remain in and fail to a ‘safe’ state within the physical environment.\nBy targeting SIS, an adversary can achieve multiple, potentially dangerous impacts, ranging from\nextensive physical system downtime to false safety alarms, physical damage, and destruction.\nAdditionally, by targeting a SIS the adversary must either intend or willfully accept the loss of\nhuman life from the operation.\n\n###### Although extremely concerning both as an attack and as an extension of ICS\n\n operations to cover SIS devices, TRISIS represents a highly-targeted threat.\n\n Specifically, TRISIS is designed to target a specific variant of Triconex systems.\n\n Additionally, an adversary would need to achieve extensive access to and\n\n penetration of a target ICS network to be in a position to deliver a TRISIS-like attack.\n\nWhile TRISIS is profoundly concerning and represents a\nsignificant new risk for defenders to manage, TRISIS-like\nattacks require substantial investments in both capability\ndevelopment and network access before adversary\nsuccess.\n\nWhile ICS defenders and asset owners should note the\nabove regarding TRISIS’ immediate impact, in the longerterm TRISIS is likely to have a concerning effect on the\nICS security space. Specifically, while TRISIS itself is\nnot portable to any environment outside of the specific\nproduct targeted in the attack, the TRISIS tradecraft has\ncreated a ‘blueprint’ for adversaries to follow concerning\nSIS attacks. This is not bound to any specific vendor and\nvendors such as ABB maturely and rightfully stated that\nsimilar styled attacks could equally impact their products.\nFurthermore, the very extension of ICS network attack to\nSIS devices sets a worrying precedent as these critical\nsystems now become an item for adversary targeting.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### | DISRUPTIVE IT MALWARE\n\nIT malware infecting and causing issues in\noperational networks is not a new phenomenon.\nTracking the metrics related to these infections\nhas always been difficult due to collection\nissues from these environments. This led to very\nlow metrics, such as the ICS- CERT’s consistent\n~200 incidents each year, to very high metrics\nincluding some vendors claiming upwards\nof 500,000 infections a year. For this reason,\nDragos created the Malware in Modern ICS\n(MIMICS) project in late 2016 and running\nthrough early 2017.[3] The research performed\na census-styled metrics count of infections in\nICS networks and identified around 3,000 unique\nindustrial infections during the research period.\nThis led to the estimate of around 6,000 unique\ninfections in industrial environments every year\nincluding various types of viruses, trojans, and\nworms. While any of these infections could\ncause issues in operational environments none\nrepresented the type of disruption that would\ncome from the latest generation of ransomware\nworms.\n\nWannaCry appeared in May 2017 following the\nweaponization of the MS17-010 vulnerability\nin the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB)\nprotocol (EterenalBlue), released as part of\nthe ‘Shadow Brokers’ continual leak of alleged\nNational Security Agency hacking tools.\nWannaCry itself was a form of ransomware\ndesigned to self-propagate via the MS17-010[4]\nvulnerability, resulting in not only a quick spread\nglobally but also the systematic infection of\nnetworks due to the malware’s ‘wormable’\nnature.\n\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n[https://dragos.com/blog/mimics/](https://dragos.com/blog/mimics/)\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security- updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### While ransomware is typically not a concern for ICS defenders,\n\n WannaCry challenged the traditional view due to its self\n propagating method exploiting a common ICS communication\n\n mechanism (SMB). \n\nVarious data transfer functions, such as moving data from the ICS\nnetwork (e.g., historians) to the business network for business\nintelligence purposes, rely upon SMB for functionality. Combined\nwith poor patch management and enabling older, vulnerable forms of\nSMB instead of the newer SMB version 3 variant, hosts within the ICS\nnetwork were not only reachable through pre-existing connections to\nthe IT network but vulnerable as well.\n\nThe result of the above circumstances was WannaCry spreading into\nand impacting ICS environments, including automotive manufacturers\nand shipping companies. The impact to operations from system loss\ndue to encryption certainly varies, but in ICS environments the damage\npotential is significant regarding lost production and capability.\n\nFurthermore, WannaCry was not the only ransomware type to\nimplement worm-like functionality, with additional malware NotPetya\nand BadRabbit emerging over the course of 2017. Of these, NotPetya\nwas especially concerning for several reasons: first, it included\nmultiple means of propagation through credential capture and reuse aside from relying solely on the MS17- 010 vulnerability; second,\nthe malware was effectively a ‘wiper’ as encrypted filesystems could\nnot be recovered. Although initially targeting Ukrainian enterprises,\nNotPetya soon spread to many organizations resulting in significant\nsystem impacts and, in several documented cases, production losses\nin ICS environments.\n\nAlthough not targeted at ICS environments, the impact of WannaCry and\nrelated malware demonstrates the capability for IT-focused malware\nto migrate into ICS environments. While patching may not be a viable\nsolution for ICS defenders in cases such as MS17-010, strengthening\nand hardening defenses at porous boundaries could help.\n\n\n###### mechanism (SMB). \n\nin ICS environments.\n\n\n-----\n\n### ACTIVITY GROUPS\n\nDragos tracks and organizes related threat activity as ‘activity\ngroups’: essentially, combinations of behavior or techniques,\ninfrastructure, and victimology.[5] This process avoids the\npotentially messy and hard-to- prove traditional attribution\nroute – aligning activity to specific actors or nation-states\n– while also providing concrete benefits to defenders by\norganizing observed attackers into collections of identified\nactions.\n\nWithin the scope of ICS network defense, Dragos currently\ntracks five activity groups that have either demonstrated the\ncapability to attack ICS networks directly or have displayed\nan interest in reconnaissance and gaining initial access into\nICS-specific entities.\n\n5 [The concept of activity groups comes from The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis: http://www.diamondmodel.org/](http://www.diamondmodel.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## ELECTRUM\n\n\n**LECTRUM is responsible for the 2016 Ukrainian  power  outage  event,  created**\nthrough CRASHOVERRIDE. In addition to this signature, high-profile event, Dragos\n##### E\nhas linked ELECTRUM with another group, the SANDWORM Advanced Persistent\nThreat (APT) (iSight), responsible for the 2015 Ukrainian outage. ELECTRUM\npreviously served as the ‘development group’ facilitating some SANDWORM activity\n– including possibly the 2015 Ukrainian power outage – but  moved into a\ndevelopment and operational role in the CRASHOVERRIDE event.\n\nWhile ELECTRUM does not have any other high-profile events to its name as of this\nwriting, Dragos has continued to track on- going, low-level activity associated with\nthe group. Most notably, 2017 did not witness another Ukrainian power grid event,\nunlike the previous two years. Based on available information, ELECTRUM remains\nactive, but evidence indicates the group may have ‘moved on’ from its previous\nfocus exclusively on Ukraine.\n\nWhile past ELECTRUM activity has focused exclusively on Ukraine, ongoing activity\nand the group’s link to SANDWORM provide sufficient evidence for Dragos to assess\nthat ELECTRUM could be ‘re-tasked’ to other areas depending on the focus of their\nsponsor.\n\n###### Given ELECTRUM’s past activity and ability to successfully operate within the ICS environment, Dragos considers them to be one of the most significant and capable threat actors within the ICS space.\n\n\n## ELECTRUM\n\n\n-----\n\n## COVELLITE\n\n\n**OVELLITE** First emerged in September 2017, when Dragos identified a\nsmall, but highly targeted, phishing campaign against a US electric grid\n#### C\ncompany. The phishing document and subsequent malware  – embedded\nwithin a malicious Microsoft Word document – both featured numerous\ntechniques to evade analysis and detection. Although the attack identified\nis particular to the one targeted entity, Dragos soon uncovered attacks with\nvarying degrees of similarity spanning Europe, North America, and East Asia.\n\n###### Common to all of these observed COVELLITE-related instances was the use of similar malware functionality, including the use of HTTPS for command and control (C2), and the use of compromised infrastructure as C2 nodes.\n\nAs Dragos continued tracking this group, we identified similarities in both\ninfrastructure and malware with the LAZARUS GROUP APT[6] (Novetta), also referred\nto as ZINC (Microsoft), and HIDDEN COBRA (DHS). This activity group has variously\nbeen associated with destructive attacks against Sony Pictures[7] and to bitcoin theft\nincidents in 2017.[8] While Dragos does not comment on or perform traditional\nnation-state attribution, the combination of technical ability plus the willingness to\nlaunch destructive attacks displayed by the linked group LAZARUS make COVELLITE\nan actor of significant interest.\n\nDragos has yet to identify another grid- specific targeting event since September 2017\nalthough similar malware and related activity continue. Finally, noted capabilities\nthus far would only suffice for initial network access and reconnaissance of a target\nnetwork – COVELLITE has not used or shown evidence of an ICS-specific capability.\n\n\n## COVELLITE\n\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\n[https://www.novetta.com/tag/the-lazarus-group/](https://www.novetta.com/tag/the-lazarus-group/)\n[http://www.novetta.com/2016/02/operation-blockbuster-unraveling-the-long-thread-of-the-sony-attack/](http://www.novetta.com/2016/02/operation-blockbuster-unraveling-the-long-thread-of-the-sony-attack/)\n[https://www recordedfuture com/north korea cryptocurrency campaign/](https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-)\n\n\n-----\n\n## DYMALLOY\n\n\nDragos began tracking the activity group we refer to as DYMALLOY in response to\nSymantec’s ‘Dragonfly 2.0’ report. Importantly, Dragos found a significant reason\nto doubt an association to the legacy Dragonfly ICS actor with the newly-identified\nactivity.\n\nDragonfly was originally active from 2011 to 2014 and utilized a combination of\nphishing, strategic website compromise, and creating malicious variants of legitimate\nsoftware to infiltrate ICS targets. Once access was gained, Dragonfly’s HAVEX[9]\nmalware leveraged OPC communications to perform survey and reconnaissance\nactivities within the affected networks.\n\n###### Although no known destructive attacks emerged from these events, Dragonfly proved itself to be a capable, knowledgeable entity able to penetrate and operate within ICS networks.\n\n**YMALLOY** is only superficially similar to Dragonfly, in that the group\nutilized phishing and strategic website compromises for initial access.\n#### D\nHowever, even at this stage, DYMALLOY employed credential harvesting\ntechniques by triggering a remote authentication attempt to attackercontrolled infrastructure, significantly different from the exploits deployed by\nDragonfly. All subsequent activity shows dramatic changes in TTPs between\nthe groups, such as differences between the content and targeting of the\nphishing messages, and the outbound SMB connections.\n\n9 The Impact of Dragonfly Malware on Industrial Control Systems – SANS Institute Whitepaper\n\n\n## DYMALLOY\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Although DYMALLOY does not appear to be linked with Dragonfly, or at least not directly, the group remains a threat to ICS owners.\n\nStarting in late 2015 and proceeding through early 2017, DYMALLOY was able to\nsuccessfully compromise multiple ICS targets in Turkey, Europe, and North America.\nDragos has also learned that, while the group does not appear to have a capability\nequivalent to Dragonfly’s HAVEX malware, the group was able to penetrate the\nICS network of several organizations, gain access to HMI devices, and exfiltrate\nscreenshots. While less technically sophisticated than HAVEX, such activity shows\nclear ICS intent and knowledge of what information could be valuable to an attacker\n– either to steal information on process functionality in the target environment or to\ngather information for subsequent operations.\n\nSince Symantec’s public reporting, followed by additional US-CERT notifications\nseveral weeks later, Dragos has not identified any additional DYMALLOY activity.\nWhile analysts found some traces of DYMALLOY-related malware in mid-2017, no\nartifacts or evidence suggesting DYMALLOY operations appear since early 2017.\nGiven the publicity, Dragos assesses with medium confidence that DYMALLOY has\nreduced operations or significantly modified them in response to security researcher\nand media attention.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CHRYSENE\n\n\nHRYSENE is an evolution of on-going activity which initially focused on\ntargets in the Persian or Arabian Gulf. CHRYSENE emerged as an off-shoot\n#### C\nto espionage operations – as well as potential preparation actions before\ndestructive attacks such as SHAMOON[10] – that focused mostly on the Gulf area\ngenerally, and Saudi Arabia specifically. CHRYSENE differs from past activity\nin that it utilizes a unique variation of a malware framework employed by other\ngroups such as Greenbug (Symantec) and OilRig (Palo Alto Networks), with\na very particular C2 technique reliant upon IPv6 DNS and the use of 64-bit\nmalware.\n\n###### Where CHRYSENE mostly differentiates itself is in targeting: all observed CHRYSENE activity focuses on Western Europe, North America, Iraq, and Israel. CHRYSENE targets oil and gas and electric generation industries primarily within these regions. This activity first emerged in mid-2017 and has continued at a steady state since.\n\nWhile CHRYSENE’s malware features notable enhancements over related threat\ngroups using similar tools, Dragos has not yet observed an ICS-specific capability\nemployed by this activity group. Instead, all activity thus far appears to focus on\nIT penetration and espionage, with all targets being ICS-related organizations.\nAlthough CHRYSENE conducts no known ICS disruption, the continued activity and\nexpansion in targeting make this group a concern that Dragos continues to track.\n\n10 [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/business/global/cyberattack-on-saudi-oil-firm-disquiets-us.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/business/global/cyberattack-on-saudi-oil-firm-disquiets-us.html)\n\n\n## CHRYSENE\n\n\n-----\n\n## MAGNALLIUM\n\n\nRAGOS began tracking MAGNALLIUM in response to public reporting\nby another security company on a group identified as ‘APT33’ (FireEye).\n#### D\nThe press initially treated MAGNALLIUM as a significant threat to ICS and\ncritical infrastructure. A subsequent investigation by Dragos indicated that\nall of this group’s activity focused on Saudi Arabia, specifically governmentrun or -owned enterprises in petrochemicals and the aerospace industry.\n\n###### While the group targets organizations which contain ICS, the lack of an ICS- specific capability combined with the group’s very narrow targeting profile make this less of a concern.\n\nWe continue to monitor MAGNALLIUM to determine if targeting changes, or if\nthis group’s actions splinter resulting in new, ‘out of area’ operations, as observed\nwith CHRYSENE.\n\n\n## MAGNALLIUM\n\n\n-----\n\nDRAGOS, INC.\n\n[www.dragos.com](http://www.dragos.com)\n\n1745 DORSEY ROAD\nHANOVER, MD 21076 USA\n[EMAIL: INFO@DRAGOS.COM](mailto:info@dragos.com)\n\n\n-----",
