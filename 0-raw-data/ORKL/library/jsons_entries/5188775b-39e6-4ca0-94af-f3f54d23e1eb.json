The group behind these attacks is known as\nDragonfly. The group has been in operation since at least 2011 but has re-emerged over the past two years from a\n[quiet period following exposure by Symantec and a number of other researchers in 2014. This “Dragonfly 2.0”](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dragonfly-western-energy-companies-under-sabotage-threat-energetic-bear)\ncampaign, which appears to have begun in late 2015, shares tactics and tools used in earlier campaigns by the\ngroup.\n\nThe energy sector has become an area of increased interest to cyber attackers over the past two years. Most\n[notably, disruptions to Ukraine’s power system in 2015 and 2016 were attributed to a cyber attack and led to power](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber-attack-energy-idUSKBN1521BA)\noutages affecting hundreds of thousands of people. In recent months, there have also been media reports of\n[attempted attacks on the electricity grids in some European countries, as well as reports of](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/statesponsored-hackers-targeted-eirgrid-electricity-network-in-devious-attack-36005921.html) companies that manage\nnuclear facilities in the U.S. being compromised by hackers.\n\nThe Dragonfly group appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access\nto operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain\ncontrol of these systems should it decide to do so. Symantec customers are protected against the activities of the\nDragonfly group.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. An outline of the Dragonfly group's activities in its most recent campaign_\n\n## Dragonfly 2.0\n\n\n-----\n\nSymantec has strong indications of attacker activity in organizations in the U.S., Turkey, and Switzerland, with\ntraces of activity in organizations outside of these countries. The U.S. and Turkey were also among the countries\ntargeted by Dragonfly in its earlier campaign, though the focus on organizations in Turkey does appear to have\nincreased dramatically in this more recent campaign.\n\nAs it did in its prior campaign between 2011 and 2014, Dragonfly 2.0 uses a variety of infection vectors in an effort to\ngain access to a victim’s network, including malicious emails, watering hole attacks, and Trojanized software.\n\nThe earliest activity identified by Symantec in this renewed campaign was a malicious email campaign that sent\nemails disguised as an invitation to a New Year’s Eve party to targets in the energy sector in December 2015.\n\nThe group conducted further targeted malicious email campaigns during 2016 and into 2017. The emails contained\nvery specific content related to the energy sector, as well as some related to general business concerns. Once\nopened, the attached malicious document would attempt to leak victims’ network credentials to a server outside of\nthe targeted organization.\n\nIn July, Cisco blogged about [email-based attacks targeting the energy sector using a toolkit called Phishery. Some](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/template-injection.html)\n[of the emails sent in 2017 that were observed by Symantec were also using the Phishery toolkit (Trojan.Phisherly),](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071414-3257-99)\nto steal victims’ credentials via a template injection attack. This toolkit became generally available on GitHub in late\n2016,\n\nAs well as sending malicious emails, the attackers also used watering hole attacks to harvest network credentials,\nby compromising websites that were likely to be visited by those involved in the energy sector.\n\nThe stolen credentials were then used in follow-up attacks against the target organizations. In one instance, after a\n[victim visited one of the compromised servers, Backdoor.Goodor was installed on their machine via PowerShell 11](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071207-0015-99)\ndays later. Backdoor.Goodor provides the attackers with remote access to the victim’s machine.\n\n[In 2014, Symantec observed the Dragonfly group compromise legitimate software in order to deliver malware to](tel:2014)\nvictims, a practice also employed in the earlier 2011 campaigns. In the 2016 and 2017 campaigns the group is using\n[the evasion framework Shellter in order to develop Trojanized applications. In particular, Backdoor.Dorshel was](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071206-3422-99)\ndelivered as a trojanized version of standard Windows applications.\n\nSymantec also has evidence to suggest that files masquerading as Flash updates may be used to install malicious\nbackdoors onto target networks—perhaps by using social engineering to convince a victim they needed to download\nan update for their Flash player. Shortly after visiting specific URLs, a file named “install_flash_player.exe” was seen\n[on victim computers, followed shortly by the Trojan.Karagany.B backdoor.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073103-3836-99)\n\nTypically, the attackers will install one or two backdoors onto victim computers to give them remote access and allow\nthem to install additional tools if necessary. Goodor, Karagany.B, and Dorshel are examples of backdoors used,\n[along with Trojan.Heriplor.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073113-4148-99)\n\nWestern energy sector at risk from ongoing cyber attacks, with potential for sabotage #dragonfly\n\n## Strong links with earlier campaigns\n\nThere are a number of indicators linking recent activity with earlier Dragonfly campaigns. In particular, the Heriplor\nand Karagany Trojans used in Dragonfly 2.0 were both also used in the earlier Dragonfly campaigns between 2011\nand 2014.\n\nT j H i l i b kd th t t b l i l d b D fl d i f th t t\n\n\n-----\n\nbehind the more recent attacks. This custom malware is not available on the black market, and has not been\nobserved being used by any other known attack groups. It has only ever been seen being used in attacks against\ntargets in the energy sector.\n\nTrojan.Karagany.B is an evolution of [Trojan.Karagany, which was previously used by Dragonfly, and there are](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-121515-0725-99)\nsimilarities in the commands, encryption, and code routines used by the two Trojans. Trojan.Karagny.B doesn’t\nappear to be widely available, and has been consistently observed being used in attacks against the energy sector.\nHowever, the earlier Trojan.Karagany was leaked on underground markets, so its use by Dragonfly is not\nnecessarily exclusive.\n\n**Feature** **Dragonfly (2013-2014)** **Dragonfly 2.0 (2015-2017)** **Link strength**\n\nBackdoor.Oldrea Yes No None\n\nTrojan.Heriplor (Oldrea stage II) Yes Yes Strong\n\nTrojan.Karagany Yes Yes (Trojan.Karagany.B) Medium-Strong\n\nTrojan.Listrix (Karagany stage II) Yes Yes Medium-Strong\n\n“Western” energy sector targeted Yes Yes Medium\n\nStrategic website compromises Yes Yes Weak\n\nPhishing emails Yes Yes Weak\n\nTrojanized applications Yes Yes Weak\n\n_Figure 2. Links between current and earlier Dragonfly cyber attack campaigns_\n\n## Potential for sabotage\n\nSabotage attacks are typically preceded by an intelligence-gathering phase where attackers collect information\nabout target networks and systems and acquire credentials that will be used in later campaigns. The most notable\nexamples of this are Stuxnet and Shamoon, where previously stolen credentials were subsequently used to\nadminister their destructive payloads.\n\nThe original Dragonfly campaigns now appear to have been a more exploratory phase where the attackers were\nsimply trying to gain access to the networks of targeted organizations. The Dragonfly 2.0 campaigns show how the\nattackers may be entering into a new phase, with recent campaigns potentially providing them with access to\noperational systems, access that could be used for more disruptive purposes in future.\n\nThe most concerning evidence of this is in their use of screen captures. In one particular instance the attackers used\na clear format for naming the screen capture files, [machine description and location].[organization name]. The\nstring “cntrl” (control) is used in many of the machine descriptions, possibly indicating that these machines have\naccess to operational systems.\n\nNumerous organizations breached in six-year campaign against the energy sector #dragonfly\n\n## Clues or false flags?\n\nWhile Symantec cannot definitively determine Dragonfly’s origins, this is clearly an accomplished attack group. It is\n\nbl f i i t t d i ti th h i t f th d t l d ti l t t\n\n\n-----\n\ndeveloped. Dragonfly is a highly focused group, carrying out targeted attacks on energy sector targets since at least\n2011, with a renewed ramping up of activity observed in the last year.\n\nSome of the group’s activity appears to be aimed at making it more difficult to determine who precisely is behind it:\n\nThe attackers used more generally available malware and “living off the land” tools, such as administration\ntools like PowerShell, PsExec, and Bitsadmin, which may be part of a strategy to make attribution more\ndifficult. The Phishery toolkit became available on Github in 2016, and a tool used by the group—Screenutil—\nalso appears to use some code from CodeProject.\n\nThe attackers also did not use any zero days. As with the group’s use of publicly available tools, this could be\nan attempt to deliberately thwart attribution, or it could indicate a lack of resources.\n\nSome code strings in the malware were in Russian. However, some were also in French, which indicates that\none of these languages may be a false flag.\n\nConflicting evidence and what appear to be attempts at misattribution make it difficult to definitively state where this\nattack group is based or who is behind it.\n\nWhat is clear is that Dragonfly is a highly experienced threat actor, capable of compromising numerous\norganizations, stealing information, and gaining access to key systems. What it plans to do with all this intelligence\nhas yet to become clear, but its capabilities do extend to materially disrupting targeted organizations should it\nchoose to do so.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec customers are protected against Dragonfly activity, Symantec has also made efforts to notify identified\ntargets of recent Dragonfly activity.\n\nSymantec has the following specific detections in place for the threats called out in this blog:\n\nSymantec has also developed a list of Indicators of Compromise to assist in identifying Dragonfly activity:\n\n**Family** **MD5** **Command & Control**\n\nBackdoor.Dorshel b3b5d67f5bbf5a043f5bf5d079dbcb56 hxxp://103.41.177.69/A56WY\n\nTrojan.Karagany.B 1560f68403c5a41e96b28d3f882de7f1 hxxp://37.1.202.26/getimage/622622.jpg\n\nTrojan.Heriplor e02603178c8c47d198f7d34bcf2d68b8\n\nTrojan.Listrix da9d8c78efe0c6c8be70e6b857400fb1\n\nHacktool.Credrix a4cf567f27f3b2f8b73ae15e2e487f00\n\nBackdoor.Goodor 765fcd7588b1d94008975c4627c8feb6\n\nTrojan.Phisherly 141e78d16456a072c9697454fc6d5f58 184.154.150.66\n\nScreenutil db07e1740152e09610ea826655d27e8d\n\nCustomers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have\npreviously received reporting on the Dragonfly 2.0 group, which included methods of detecting and thwarting the\nactivities of this adversary.\n\n\n-----\n\nDragonfly relies heavily on stolen credentials to compromise a network. Important passwords, such as those\nwith high privileges, should be at least 8-10 characters long (and preferably longer) and include a mixture of\nletters and numbers. Encourage users to avoid reusing the same passwords on multiple websites and\nsharing passwords with others should be forbidden. Delete unused credentials and profiles and limit the\n[number of administrative-level profiles created. Employ two-factor authentication (such as Symantec VIP) to](https://vip.symantec.com/)\nprovide an additional layer of security, preventing any stolen credentials from being used by attackers.\n\nEmphasize multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard against single point\nfailures in any specific technology or protection method. This should include the deployment of regularly\nupdated firewalls as well as gateway antivirus, intrusion detection or protection systems (IPS), website\nvulnerability with malware protection, and web security gateway solutions throughout the network.\n\nImplement and enforce a security policy whereby any sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Ensure\nthat customer data is encrypted as well. This can help mitigate the damage of potential data leaks from within\nan organization.\n\nImplement SMB egress traffic filtering on perimeter devices to prevent SMB traffic leaving your network onto\nthe internet.\n\nEducate employees on the dangers posed by spear-phishing emails, including exercising caution around\nemails from unfamiliar sources and opening attachments that haven’t been solicited. A full protection stack\n[helps to defend against emailed threats, including Symantec Email Security.cloud, which can block email-](https://www.symantec.com/products/email-security-cloud)\n[borne threats, and Symantec Endpoint Protection, which can block malware on the endpoint.](https://www.symantec.com/products/endpoint-protection) Symantec\nMessaging Gateway’s Disarm technology can also protect computers from threats by removing malicious\ncontent from attached documents before they even reach the user.\n\nUnderstanding the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of adversaries through services like DeepSight\nAdversary Intelligence fuels effective defense from advanced adversaries like Dragonfly 2.0. Beyond\ntechnical understanding of the group, strategic intelligence that informs the motivation, capability, and likely\nnext moves of the adversaries ensures more timely and effective decisions in proactively safeguarding your\nenvironment from these threats.\n\n[Tags: Security, Endpoint Protection, Endpoint Protection Cloud, Security Response, Dragonfly, energy](https://www.symantec.com/connect/search?filters=im_vid_31:691)\n[sector, sabotage, Switzerland, targeted attacks, Turkey, U.S.](https://www.symantec.com/connect/search?filters=im_vid_111:70001)\n\n\n-----",
