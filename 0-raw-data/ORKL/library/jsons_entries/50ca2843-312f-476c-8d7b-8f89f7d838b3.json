The contents and organization of the files led experts to conclude that](https://medium.com/@thegrugq/shadow-broker-breakdown-b05099eb2f4a#.184ic97r1)\nthey were accidentally left behind on a compromised server once used as a staging area by\nan NSA-linked hacking entity called Equation Group.\n\n[That theory was reinforced last week, when Reuters reported that \"four people with direct](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-nsa-tools-idUSKCN11S2MF)\nknowledge\" of an FBI investigation into the leak had stated that the files were found by\nRussian hackers after NSA operatives \"mistakenly\" abandoned them on a remote server.\nThere is still no conclusive evidence that TheShadowBrokers is associated with Russian\nintelligence services, however.\n\nMotherboard reached out to the hackers and will post an update if we receive a response.\nHowever, the group stated in their Medium post that they would only agree to interviews if\noffered money.\n\nOf course, it's not exactly surprising that no one is rushing to bid on the group's stolen files.\nWhile the tools are likely legit, the high profile of the leak makes it insanely risky, and the\nsuspected age of the exploit code makes it unclear whether the hacks are even still effective.\n\nAt the time of this writing, TheShadowBrokers have only received bids for a total of 1.76\nbitcoins—or about $1,082—far below the group's asking price of $1 million.\n\n## ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
