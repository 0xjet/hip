    "plain_text": "Spamhaus tracks both Internet Protocol\n(IP) addresses and domain names used\nby threat actors for hosting botnet\ncommand & control (C&C) servers. This\ndata enables us to identify associated\nelements, including the geolocation of the\nbotnet C&Cs, the malware associated with\nthem, the top-level domains used when\nregistering a domain for a botnet C&C, and\nthe sponsoring registrars and the network\nhosting the botnet C&C infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Spotlight\n## Initial Access Brokers – are they selling access to your network?\n\nInitial Access Brokers (IABs) have been one of the top\nthreats over the past years. But what are they, and why\nare they so dangerous?\n\n\n### An explanation\n\n\nThe term “Initial Access Brokers” refers to threat\nactors who usually operate in groups, trying to breach\ncorporate networks. They use various tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs) to achieve their goals.\n\n\n### Ways IABs operate\n\n\nOne of their preferred TTPs is to spread malware via\nopportunistic or targeted malspam campaigns. For\nthis purpose, brokers either develop their own piece of\nmalware or rent access to Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)\nbotnets. The list of malware families known to be used\nby such brokers is long: Emotet, IcedID, Dridex, Qakbot,\nand many more. One of the most recent emerging threats\nused by such brokers is BumbleBee. You can read more\nabout the rise of BumbleBee in this update.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, malware isn’t the only way these IABs enter\nyour corporate network. Another tactic is to exploit\nexposed software or devices connected to the internet.\nBrokers focus on known software vulnerabilities that\npotential victims have failed to patch (e.g., Microsoft\nExchange Servers). Alternatively, they’ll use brute force\nattacks where weak credentials are employed, e.g.,\nfor remote access.\n\n\n### And after they’ve breached your network…?\n\n\nInitially, the broker will try to identify which network\nthey have penetrated. Important information for the\nattackers to ascertain is the organization’s country and\nsector along with its size, e.g., the number of employees\n& revenue.\n\nArmed with a good understanding of the value attached\nto the “asset”, the broker will then engage with potential\nbuyers to see who wants to purchase access to the\nvictim’s network.\n\n\n### And then?\n\n\nWhat happens from this point forwards wholly depends\non the buyer. They may not use the access immediately.\nOn the other hand, the buyer may immediately conduct\nreconnaissance and lateral movement as soon as they\nhave access, which may lead to full encryption of the\nvictim’s network with ransomware within just a couple\nof hours.\n\n\n### How can you protect against IABs?\n\n\nWhile this may sound scary, there are simple ways\nto protect yourself from this kind of threat.\n\n1. \u0007Watch out for indicators of potential compromise\non the network level and your endpoints.\n\n2. \u0007Secure any remote access with multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA).\n\n3. \u0007Deploy critical security patches as soon as possible,\nonce they are released.\n\nThis may sound like security 101, but breaches regularly\noccur because organizations do not follow these best\ncommon practices.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Number of botnet C&Cs observed,  Q3 2022\n\nIn Q3 2022, Spamhaus identified 4,331 botnet C&Cs\ncompared to 3,141 in Q2 2022. This was a 38% increase\nquarter on quarter. The monthly average increased from\n\n**What are botnet command**\n\n1,047 in Q2 to 1,444 botnet C&Cs per month in Q3.\n\n**& controllers?**\n\nA ‘botnet controller,’ ‘botnet C2’ or\n\n**Quarter** **No. of Botnets** **Quarterly Average** **% Change** ‘botnet command & control’ server\n\nQ4, 2021 3,271 1,090 +23% is commonly abbreviated to ‘botnet\n\nC&C.’ Fraudsters use these to both\n\nQ1, 2022 3,538 1,179 +8% control malware-infected machines\n\nQ2, 2022 3,141 1,047 -11% and extract personal and valuable\n\ndata from malware-infected victims.\n\nQ3, 2022 4,331 1,444 +38%\n\n\n-----\n\n## Geolocation of botnet C&Cs,  Q3 2022\n\n### Botnet C&C boom in China \n\nThe number of newly observed botnet C&C servers in\nChina went through the roof last quarter - we recorded\na 3884% increase in botnet C&C activity in China. That’s\nmore than 900 additional botnet C&Cs than we saw in Q2.\nMost of the activity in this region was related to misuse of\nthe legitimate penetration testing tool, Cobalt Strike.\n\n### Increase in botnet C&C activity in central Europe and North America\n\nWe saw an increase in botnet C&C activity across central\nEurope, including Switzerland (+126%), United Kingdom\n(+116%), Germany (+57%), France (+54%) and Netherlands\n(+36%). Meanwhile, the United States experienced a 140%\nincrease in botnet C&Cs, and Canada was a new entry\nat #11.\n\n\n### Improvements across Eastern Europe\n\n\nAn interesting observation for Q3 is that overall, many\nEastern European countries experienced a decrease\nin the numbers of botnet C&Cs, e.g., Bulgaria, Latvia,\nMoldova, Romania and Ukraine. As a result, these\ncountries all departed from our quarterly ranking.\nNice work!\n\n\n### Significant decrease in Russia\n\n\nOne surprise in Q3 was a significant decrease in the\nnumber of newly observed botnet C&Cs in Russia.\nThe number fell by 891, from 1254 botnet C&Cs\nin Q2 to only 363 in Q3. That’s reduced by almost\nthree quarters (-71%).\n\n### Improvements continue across the  LatAm region\n\nWith the exception of Brazil, the situation in LatAm\ncountries continues to improve in Q3, as it has done since\nthe beginning of the year. The Dominican Republic (-44%)\nand Mexico (-24%), both experienced a reduction in the\nnumber of botnet C&Cs. Let’s hope they drop off the\nTop 20 in Q4, just as Uruguay did in Q2.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Geolocation of botnet C&Cs, Q3 2022 (continued)\n\n\n### Top 20 locations of botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Country** **Q2** **Q3** **% Change**\n**2022** **2022** **Q on Q**\n\n**#1** China 25 996 3884%\n\n**#2** United States 384 922 140%\n\n**#3** Russia 1254 363 -71%\n\n**#4** Netherlands 216 293 36%\n\n**#5** Germany 159 249 57%\n\n**#6** France 78 120 54%\n\n**#7** Saudi Arabia 205 110 -46%\n\n**#8** Mexico 137 104 -24\n\n**#9** Singapore - 96 New Entry\n\n**#10** United Kingdom 31 67 116%\n\n\n**Rank** **Country** **Q2** **Q3** **% Change**\n**2022** **2022** **Q on Q**\n\n**#11** Canada - 52 New Entry\n\n**#12** Japan - 50 New Entry\n\n**#13** Korea - 48 New Entry\n\n**#13** Dominican Rep 85 48 -44%\n\n**#15** Finland - 47 New Entry\n\n**#16** Lithuania - 44 New Entry\n\n**#17** Switzerland 19 43 126%\n\n**#18** India - 42 New Entry\n\n**#19** Czech Republic - 33 New Entry\n\n**#20** Brazil 22 29 32%\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs, Q3 2022\n\n\n### Cobalt Strike strikes!\n\n\nWe have previously reported on Cobalt Strike - sadly,\ndespite being a legitimate tool, Cobalt Strike is extensively\nused by threat actors with malicious intent, for example,\nto deploy ransomware. Last quarter, we identified almost\n2,000 new Cobalt Strike botnet C&Cs, making it the most\ndominant threat in Q3.\n\n### RedLineStealer C&Cs go through the roof\n\nRedLineStealer has been present in our Top 20 for\nyears. However, the number of newly observed C&Cs\nassociated with RedLineStealer exploded in Q3 by 409%,\nfrom 77 to 392. RedLine is one of the most successful\ncredential stealers, sold as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)\non the dark web.\n\n### RATs and more RATs!\n\nRemote Access Trojans (RATs) have always been very\npopular among threat actors - in Q3, they accounted\nfor 35% of all botnet C&Cs. Increases occurred across\nalmost all of the popular RATs that criminals are\ncurrently selling on the dark web, including DCRat\nwith 521% (#10), NanoCore with 264% (#15) and\nRemcos with 200% (#10).\n\n### Hello, BumbleBee!\n\nHeard about BumbleBee before? If not, keep reading!\nBumbleBee is a backdoor that provides threat actors\naccess to the victim’s machine. Like Emotet and IcedID,\nBumbleBee acts as an Initial Access Broker, selling\naccess to compromised corporate networks on the\ndark web that often leads to ransomware. In Q3,\nBumbleBee eclipsed all its competitors, including\nEmotet. We suggest you keep a close eye on this\nthreat over the coming months!\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs, Q3 2022 (continued)\n\n\n### Emotet\n\n\nSince we’ve mentioned Emotet, we thought some readers\nmight wonder if its appearance in the Top 20 means this\nmalware is back up and running following its takedown in\n[January 2021. The truth is that while our researchers are](https://www.spamhaus.org/news/article/805/emotet-infrastructure-disrupted-after-coordinated-action)\nobserving botnet C&Cs firing, we haven’t seen Emotet\nactivity for some time i.e., the house door may be open,\nbut no one is home.\n\n### Flubot labeling\n\nAlthough FluBot’s activity decreased massively in the\nsecond half of 2022, we continue to see a high number\nof newly observed botnet C&Cs associated with it.\nAs we’ve mentioned in previous updates, this is because\nFlubot is using a technique called “FastFlux” to host its\nbotnet C&Cs. The same botnet infrastructure also serves\nas C&Cs for other malware families, such as TeamBot.\nTo make our internal tracking of this threat easier, we\ncontinue to label the associated infrastructure as “FluBot.”\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,  Q3 2022 (continued)\n\n\n### Malware families associated with botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Q2 2022** **Q3 2022** **% Change** **Malware Family** **Description**\n\n**#1** - 1902 New Entry Cobalt Strike Pentest Tool\n\n**#2** 77 392 409% RedLineStealer Credential Stealer\n\n**#3** - 346 New Entry Flubot Android Backdoor\n\n**#4** - 213 New Entry Qakbot Backdoor\n\n**#5** - 154 New Entry RecordBreaker Credential Stealer\n\n**#6** - 152 New Entry Bumblebee Backdoor\n\n**#7** - 112 New Entry Emotet Backdoor\n\n**#8** - 97 New Entry NjRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#9** 71 89 25% AsyncRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#10** 14 87 521% DCRat Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#10** 29 87 200% Remcos Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#12** 41 67 63% AveMaria Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#13** - 61 New Entry Tofsee Spambot\n\n**#14** 15 58 287% Arkei Credential Stealer\n\n**#15** 14 51 264% NanoCore Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#16** - 43 New Entry Dridex Backdoor\n\n**#17** 99 35 -65% Loki Credential Stealer\n\n**#18** - 28 New Entry NetWire Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#19** 27 25 -7% Vjw0rm Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#20** 13 20 54% Socelars Credential Stealer\n\n\n**0** **500** **1000** **1500** **2000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware type comparisons between  Q2 2022 and Q3 2022\n\n1.21%\n\nDDoS bot\n\n0%\n\n3.78%\n\ne-banking Trojan\n\n0%\n\n26.17%\n\nDropper\n\n0%\n\n0%\n\nAndroid Backdoor\n\n8.61%\n\nPentest 0%\nFramework 47.33%\n\n1.82%\n\nBackdoor\n\n12.94%\n\nSpambot 0.00%\n\n1.52%\n\nRemote Access 34.64%\nTrojan (RAT) 13.21%\n\n32.38%\n\nCredential Stealer\n\n16.40%\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%**\n\nQ2 2022 Q3 2022\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Q3 2022\n\n### Freenom continues to dominate our Top 20\n\nWhile a few of the TLDs operated by Freenom improved\nover the last quarter, others had marked increases in the\nnumber of new botnet C&Cs associated with them. TLDs\n\n**a brief overview**\n\ngq, tk, ga, ml, cf are all operated by Freenom and appear\ntoo frequently in the Top 20. Come on, Freenom – you\ncan do better.\n\n**Generic TLDs (gTLDs)**\n\n### Increase in botnet C&Cs hosted on LatAm TLDs\n\nWhen it comes to the LatAm region, both ccTLD .co (#13)\nand .br (#20) both experienced significant increases in\nbotnet C&Cs associated with their TLDs in Q3. some are closed e.g., .honda.\n\n\n### Interpreting the data\n\n\nRegistries with a greater number of active domains have\ngreater exposure to abuse. For example, in Q3 2022,\n.com had more than 150 million domains, of which 0.001%\nwere associated with botnet C&Cs. Meanwhile, .ga had\napproximately 6,500 domains, of which 3.263% were\nassociated with botnet C&Cs. Both are in the top ten\nof our listings. Still, one had a much higher percentage\nof domains related to botnet C&Cs than the other.\n\n(1) www.spamhaus.com/resource-center/we-hope-you-keep-sbs-clean-shortdot/\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,  Q3 2022 (continued)\n\n### Working together with the industry for  a safer internet\n\nNaturally, our preference is for no TLDs to have botnet **New entries**\nC&Cs linked with them, but we live in the real world\nand understand there will always be abuse.\n\n.br(#20).\n\nWhat is crucial is that abuse is dealt with quickly.\n\n**Departures**\n\nWhere necessary, if domain names are registered\nsolely for distributing malware or hosting botnet C&Cs, .club, .eu, .live, .site\nwe would like registries to suspend these domain names.\nWe greatly appreciate the efforts of many registries\nwho work with us to ensure these actions are taken.\n\n\n### Top abused TLDs - number of domains\n\n\n**Rank** **Q2 2022** **Q3 2022** **% Change** **TLD** **Note**\n\n**#1** 2133 1674 -22% com gTLD\n\n**#2** 168 442 163% ml Originally ccTLD, now effectively gTLD\n\n**#3** 228 244 7% top gTLD\n\n**#4** 112 213 90% ga Originally ccTLD, now effectively gTLD\n\n**#5** 218 181 -17% cloud gTLD\n\n**#6** 171 139 -19% tk Originally ccTLD, now effectively gTLD\n\n**#7** 121 134 11% xyz gTLD\n\n**#8** 167 117 -30% org gTLD\n\n**#9** 102 101 -1% info gTLD\n\n**#10** 173 85 -51% cf Originally ccTLD, now effectively gTLD\n\n**#11** - 84 New Entry cyou gTLD\n\n**#11** 76 84 11% us ccTLD\n\n**#13** 38 78 105% co ccTLD\n\n**#14** - 73 New Entry online gTLD\n\n**#15** 57 71 25% net gTLD\n\n**#16** 31 59 90% ru ccTLD\n\n**#17** 119 56 -53% gq ccTLD\n\n**#18** 25 52 108% shop gTLD\n\n**#19** - 49 New Entry fun gTLD\n\n**#20** - 47 New Entry br ccTLD\n\n\n**0** **500** **1000** **1500** **2000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused domain registrars,  Q3 2022\n\n\n### Kudos to Key Systems and PDR\n\n\nThe German-based domain registrar Key Systems and\nIndian-based PDR have both improved massively.
