In this report\nwe provide a broad view of the 2015 threat\nlandscape, ranging from industry-wide data\nto a focused look at different technologies,\nincluding open source, mobile, and the\nInternet of Things. The goal of this report is\nto provide security information leading to a\nbetter understanding of the threat landscape,\nand to provide resources that can aid in\nminimizing security risk.\n\n###### About Hewlett Packard\n Enterprise Security Research\n\nHPE Security Research conducts innovative\nresearch in multiple focus areas, delivering\nsecurity intelligence across the portfolio\nof HPE security products. In addition, our\npublished research provides vendor-agnostic\ninsight and information freely to the public\nand private security ecosystems.\n\nHPE Security Research brings together data\nand research to produce a detailed picture\nof both sides of the security coin—the state\nof the vulnerabilities and threats composing\nthe attack surface, and the ways adversaries\nexploit those weaknesses to compromise\ntargets. Our continuing analysis of threat\nactors and the methods they employ guides\ndefenders to better assess risk and choose\nappropriate controls and protections.\n\n\nHPE Security Research publishes detailed research and findings\nthroughout the year, but our annual Risk Report stands apart from the\nday-to-day opportunities and crises our researchers and other security\nprofessionals face.\n\nJust as HPE has evolved to stay ahead of the challenges brought on by\ngrowing frequency and sophistication in enterprise attacks, the threat\nlandscape and how we protect the digital enterprise has also transformed.\nTaking a retrospective look at this changing landscape provides critical\ninsights into the most prominent cyber risks while offering intelligence to\nenterprises looking to focus security investments and resources.\n\nIn 2015, we saw a continued rise in attackers’ success at infiltrating\nenterprise networks, making it all the more critical for HPE’s cybersecurity\nresearch team to provide this unique perspective on significant trends\nin the marketplace. Just as attackers continue to evolve their techniques,\ndefenders must accelerate their approach to detection, protection,\nresponse, and recovery.\n\nOur research saw an increased sophistication of attacks, even as the\nsecurity world is encumbered by the same issues that have plagued\nus for years. The work done by our research team shows that even as\nregulations become more complex and attack surfaces continue to grow,\nfoundational problems exist that challenge even the best defender.\nOur more sophisticated customers are responding to these threats,\nbut many small and mid-market customers are not, thus making them\nan easier target.\n\nSecurity practitioners from enterprises of all sizes must embrace the\nrapid transformation of IT and ready themselves for both a new wave of\nregulations and an increased complexity in attacks. The HPE Security\nResearch group continues to prepare for the challenges—and the\nopportunities—the future will doubtless hold. It remains our fullest\nintention to invest in driving our thought leadership throughout the\nsecurity community and to share our findings as they become available.\n\nSue Barsamian\nSenior Vice President and General Manager\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Security Products\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Our data\n\nTo provide a broad perspective on the nature\nof the attack surface, the report draws on\ndata from HPE security teams, open source\nintelligence, ReversingLabs, and Sonatype.\n\n###### Key themes\n\n**Theme #1: The year of collateral damage**\nIf 2014 was the Year of the Breach, 2015 was\nthe Year of Collateral Damage as certain\nattacks touched people who never dreamed\nthey might be involved in a security breach.\nBoth the United States Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) and the Ashley Madison\nbreaches affected those who never had\ndirect contact with either entity, and whose\ninformation resided in their networks only as\nit related to someone else—or, in the case of\nthe Ashley Madison breach, did not appear at\nall but could be easily deduced from revealed\ndata. With the OPM breach, the true targets\nof the breach may be people who never\nthemselves consented to inclusion in the\nOPM database—and who may be in danger\nthanks to its compromise. Data compromise\nis no longer just about getting payment card\ninformation. It’s about getting the information\ncapable of changing someone’s life forever.\n\n**Theme #2: Overreaching regulations**\n**push research underground**\nWhen horrific events occur impacting the\nlives of many, there is a natural reaction\nto do something to try to prevent future\noccurrences. Too often, the “something”\n(legislation) incurs unwanted consequences\nto go along with the intended result. This is\nthe case with various proposed regulations\ngoverning cybersecurity. While the intent\nto protect from attack is apparent, the\nresult pushes legitimate security research\nunderground and available only to those\ndenizens who dwell there. To be effective,\nregulations impacting security must\nprotect and encourage research that\nbenefits everyone.\n\n\n**Theme #3: Moving from point fixes to**\n**broad impact solutions**\nWhile it is laudable that Microsoft® and\nAdobe® both released more patches than at\nany point in their history, it remains unclear if\nthis level of patching is sustainable. It strains\nresources of both the vendor developing\nthe patch and the customer deploying the\npatch. Microsoft has made some headway\nwith defensive measures that prevent classes\nof attacks. It and others must invest in these\nbroad, asymmetric fixes that knock out many\nvulnerabilities at once.\n\n**Theme #4: Political pressures attempt to**\n**decouple privacy and security efforts**\nA difficult and violent year on the global\nscene, combined with lingering distrust\nof American tech initiatives in the wake of\nrevelations by Edward Snowden and other\nwhistleblowers, led to a fraught year for\ndata privacy, encryption, and surveillance\nworldwide. Many lawmakers in the US, UK,\nand elsewhere claimed that security was\nonly possible if fundamental rights of privacy\nand due process were abridged—even as,\nironically, the US saw the sunset of similar\nlaws passed in the wake of the September\n11, 2001, attacks. This is not the first time\nthat legislators have agitated to abridge\nprivacy rights in the name of “security” (more\naccurately, perceived safety), but in 2015\nefforts to do so could easily be compared to\nthe low success of previous efforts made after\nthe attacks of 2001. Those evaluating the\nsecurity of their enterprises would do well\nto monitor government efforts such as\nadding “backdoors” to encryption and other\nsecurity tools.\n\n\n**Theme #5: The industry didn’t learn**\n**anything about patching in 2015**\nThe most exploited bug from 2014 happened\nto be the most exploited bug in 2015 as\nwell—and it’s now over five years old. While\nvendors continue to produce security\nremediations, it does little good if they are\nnot installed by the end user. However, it’s not\nthat simple. Applying patches in an enterprise\nis not trivial and can be costly—especially\nwhen other problems occur as a result. The\nmost common excuse given by those who\ndisable automatic updates or fail to install\npatches is that patches break things. Software\nvendors must earn back the trust of users—\ntheir direct customers—to help restore faith\nin automatic updates.\n\n**Theme #6: Attackers have shifted their**\n**efforts to directly attack applications**\nThe perimeter of your network is no longer\nwhere you think it is. With today’s mobile\ndevices and broad interconnectivity, the\nactual perimeter of your network is likely in\nyour pocket right now. Attackers realize this\nas well and have shifted their focus from\nservers and operating systems directly to\napplications. They see this as the easiest\nroute to accessing sensitive enterprise\ndata and are doing everything they can to\nexploit it. Today’s security practitioner must\nunderstand the risk of convenience and\ninterconnectivity to adequately protect it.\n\n**Theme #7: The monetization of malware**\nJust as the marketplace has grown for\nvulnerabilities, malware in 2015 took on a new\nfocus. In today’s environment, malware needs\nto produce revenue, not just be disruptive.\nThis has led to an increase in ATM-related\nmalware, banking Trojans, and ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The business of bugs\n\nIn the modern world, having insecure software\nand services can negatively impact the\nbottom line of an enterprise. As breaches\nbecome more prevalent, the tools and\ntechniques used in these breaches gain\nlegitimacy and a monetary value. Put more\nsimply, 2015 saw the culmination of the\nmonetization of vulnerabilities.\n\nLooking at the past year, it becomes clear\nthat security researchers play an increasingly\nimportant role in identifying security\nvulnerabilities and investigating statesponsored threats. As they do so, researchers\nbecome increasingly misunderstood,\nbordering on imperiled, by well-meaning\ngovernments resorting to broad legislation\nto protect themselves and their citizens\nfrom attacks. The playing field on which the\ninformation security community operates may\nhave undergone a major shift in 2015, but it’s\nbeen a long time coming.\n\n**Hacking Team exposes the gory details**\n\nHacking Team, a Milan-based company\nselling offensive technology, found itself the\nvictim of a breach resulting in the release of\ncompany emails, passwords, and documents.[1]\nThis breach gave everyone a rare look into\nthe inner workings of a zero-day exploits\nvendor. Hacking Team began moving from a\ntraditional defensive information consultancy\nto a surveillance business in 2009 with the\ncultivation of relationships with zero-day\nvendors. It began purchasing exploit packs\nbut was not impressed with the quality.[2]\n\n1 http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/07/06/hackingteam hacked/\n\n\n3 https://tsyrklevich.net/2015/07/22/hacking-team-0day-market/. 5 This list is only reporting vendor programs and not those run by thirdparty platforms\n\n\nIn 2013 it made several new contacts and\ncontinued to grow external relationships with\nzero-day providers.[3] The exposure of detailed\nexploit deals and Hacking Team’s customer\nlist has allowed us to check assumptions\nabout the zero-day marketplace, revealing\npricing, exploit quality, and limiters to the\nsurveillance business, such as the\nWassenaar Arrangement.\n\n**20 years and counting**\n\nIncentivizing security researchers to find\ncritical vulnerabilities in software has been a\ntactic employed by software vendors, security\ncompanies, and—more recently—B2B/B2C\nentities for two decades. Netscape initiated\nits rewards program in 1995 and is most\ncommonly credited with establishing the\nconcept of “bug bounties.” Rewarding skilled\nresearchers for identifying potential avenues\nto the enterprises’ crown jewels has taken\nmany forms, from public recognition to money,\nand everything in between. Over the past\ncouple of years there has been growth in the\nnumber of organizations outside of high tech\nrunning bug-bounty programs. There has also\nbeen an increase in the number of third-party\nplatforms (e.g., Bugcrowd, Crowdcurity, and\nHackerOne) as they manage the operational\nend of the program, saving their customers\nsignificant expense in doing so themselves.\nThe Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), at the time a\npart of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE),\noperated a hybrid version of a bug-bounty\nprogram, which accepted critical vulnerabilities\nin enterprise software including that offered\nby HPE.\n\n\nOver the course of 2014 and 2015 there has\nbeen an observable increase in vendors\nlaunching programs—either through thirdparty platforms as mentioned above—\nor doing so themselves. Bugsheet, a\ncommunity-curated list of bug-bounty and\ndisclosure programs, is currently tracking\nmore than 350 programs[4] with varying\nrewards (bounties, acknowledgements, or\nswag).[5] Bugcrowd also tracks a list of bugbounty and disclosure programs as reported\nby their researcher community and lists over\n450 programs, noting whether they pay a\nreward, give acknowledgements, or provide\nswag to the participating researchers.[6] Many\ncompanies appear on both lists. Historically,\nthe vendors offering bug bounties have been\nin the high-tech industry, but we are starting\nto see a growth in non-IT industries joining in,\nespecially as they look to breach risks related\nto their online presence.\n\nConsistent security at scale is incredibly hard\nto achieve alone. Running a bug-bounty\nprogram expands a company’s available\nresources more affordably. Some of the\nmost notable programs in the past 20 years\n(Figure 1) can attest to this fact. Engaging the\ncommunity returns many high value bugs the\nvendor may never learn about or only learn\nof through an attack in the wild (i.e., used\nin active attacks). None of the bug-bounty\nprograms are about silencing the researcher.\nWhile some may view it as hush money, the\nresearch community sees it as payment for\nits work—especially when it reports a clever\nedge case.\n\n\n-----\n\n**ZDI@10**\n\nOne of the oldest bug-bounty programs\naround, the ZDI was founded in 2005 to\nprotect the IT ecosystem by compensating\nindependent researchers for submitting their\nfinds to the program. Since that launch and\nsince its purchase by Hewlett Packard in 2010,\nZDI grew into the world’s largest vendoragnostic bug-bounty program. In the fall of\n2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced\nthe signing of a definitive agreement to\ndivest the TippingPoint business and ZDI to\nTrend Micro. Throughout the lifespan of the\nprogram, the core principles established\nat the beginning have remained in force\n(Figure 2).\n\nThe ZDI follows iDefense’s middleman\nmodel. In fact, the ZDI was originally founded\nat TippingPoint by the same people that\ncreated iDefense’s program.[7] In 2007, Dragos\nRuiu started the Pwn2Own contest to run at\nhis CanSecWest security conference.[8] The\ninitial contest prize was a laptop, but later\nupgraded to a $10,000 reward provided by\nZDI. Pwn2Own proved to be a great success\nand became a recurring event at CanSecWest.\nIn 2012, the ZDI and Dragos teamed up to\nlaunch Mobile Pwn2Own (mPwn2Own)\nat the EUSec conference in Amsterdam.\nIt later moved to Tokyo and the PacSec\nconference. In 2014, the event paid out\n$850,000 in rewards to skilled security\nresearchers for more than 30 vulnerabilities,\nthe highest contest payout to date.[9] In\n10 years, the ZDI program has paid more\nthan $12M and disclosed more than 2000\nvulnerabilities, with another 300+ with\nvendors awaiting patch.\n\n|Col1|1995: Netscape|Col3|2004: Mozilla, Firefox|Col5|2007: Pwn20wn|Col7|2011: Facebook|Col9|2014: Etsy, Microsoft, GitHub|Col11|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||2002: iDefense||2005: Zero Day Initiative||2010: Google, Barracuda Networks, Deutche Post||2013: Tesla||2015: United Airlines, F-Secure|\n\n\nFigure 1.

In 2013, Tesla\nMotors created a bug-bounty program, later\nexpanding it and handing it over to Bugcrowd\nto manage.[11] Earlier this year, the first airline\njoined the community. United Airlines\nfocuses on vulnerabilities reported against its\nwebsites, applications, and online portals and\nrewards researchers in a rather unique way—\nwith 50,000 to one million air miles.[12]\n\nWhile working to gain researcher interest\nand loyalty on the one hand, a successful\nbug-bounty program must also establish\ncontacts with the affected vendors. Gaining\ntheir trust is crucial to long-term success.\nNot surprisingly, conversations between\nvendors and ZDI have been both congenial\nand contentious—often during the same\nconversation. Ultimately, most have come to\ntrust that the program is helping them and\nour collective customers.\n\n\nFigure 3. Vulnerability marketplace options\n\n###### Different types of bounties\n**White/Gray/Black**\n\nAt its core, a bug bounty is a cooperative\nrelationship with the intent of identifying and\ncorrecting application vulnerabilities before\nthey are exploited in the wild. Identifying\napplication vulnerabilities has become a\nlucrative business with its own marketplace\nand players. When talking about the\n\n\nvarious players in this market, their ethics\nand motivations are often the first thing\nquestioned, with categorization by the color\nof a hat (black, gray, or white) following close\nbehind. The things that actually differentiate\nthe players are the marketplace and the\ngovernment under which each of them finds\nhimself operating. Let’s start with a look at the\nmarketplace.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### WHITE MARKET\n\n\n###### Option 3 Result 3\n\nSubmit flaw directly to vendor. Bugs get fixed.\nResearchers can submit flaws\ndirectly to vendors or through\ntheir bug-bounty programs.\n\n\nFigure 4. The vulnerability white market\n\nBoth vendor programs and the previously\nmentioned third-party programs operate\nin the white market. Security researchers\nsubmit the vulnerability to either and receive\na reward, recognition, or both in trade for\ntheir promise to not disclose it—publicly or\nprivately—until the vendor has fixed the flaw.\nIt is understood that the fix should happen in\na timely fashion, but ideas differ on just what\ntimely means (Figure 4).\n\nIn the gray market, the researcher sells\nthe vulnerability to a private broker. It’s\noften unclear where the flaw will end up\nand what it will be used for. Some brokers\nhave policies that state they will only sell to\nethical and approved sources. Of course,\nwhat they consider to be ethical may be\ndifferent than what others consider to be\nethical. Vulnerabilities on the gray market may\nultimately be used to spy on private citizens\nsuspected of criminal activities or used to\nshut down terrorist operations (Figure 5).\n\n\n###### GRAY MARKET\n\n\n###### Option 4 Result 4\n\n\n**Implications**\nSell vulnerability to\nprivate broker\n\nIt is unclear where the flaw\nwill end up and what it will\nbe used for. Some gray\nmarket brokers have policies\nstating that they will only\n\nsell to ethical and\n###### approved sources.\n\nFigure 5. The vulnerability gray market\n\n\n**Examples of what can happen**\n\nUsed to spy on\nprivate citizens\nsuspected of\ncrimes\n\nUsed to shut down\nsuspected terrorist\noperations\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BLACK MARKET\n\n\nHistorically, the black market has been\na method for researchers to sell the\nvulnerability to the highest bidder with the\nunderstanding that it will be used at the sole\ndiscretion of the purchaser and likely not for\nthe greater good. Typical outcomes include\ncybercrime (used to exploit companies in\norder to steal data or money) and spying\n(used for political gain or for corporate\nespionage). More recently, there have been\nprivate brokers operating openly on the black\nmarket. They pay top dollar for critical wares,\nsuch as jailbreaks of the latest version of iOS,\nand only make these exploits available to their\npaying customers—never to the software\nvendor.[13, 14 ](Figure 6)\n\nThere’s always a way to avoid the market\naltogether by dropping zero days outside of\nany vendor reporting, an option known as\nfull disclosure (Figure 7). Even in these cases,\nresearchers still monetize the bug by being\ninvited to conferences and increasing their\nreputational standing in the community.\n\n\n###### Option 5 Result 5\n\n**Implications** **Examples of what can happen**\n\n\nFlaw is\n###### sold to highest bidder, \nand will be used to\ndisrupt private or public\nindividuals and groups.\n\nFigure 6. The vulnerability black market\n\n\n###### Cybercrime:\nused to steal money from\nindividuals or groups\n\n###### Spying:\nused for political gain or\nto steal corporate secrets\n\n\n###### OPT OUT\n\n\n###### Option 6 Result 6\n\n**Disclose flaw publicly** If disclosed publicly, vendors are\n(full disclosure). pressured to respond faster.\n\n\nPublic disclosure is often a\nresult if vendors are\n###### unresponsive or slow to fix issues that have\nbeen disclosed to them by\nindependent researchers.\n\nFigure 7. Opting out of the market altogether\n\n\n“After having its security\n**disclosure go ignored since**\n**August, Gibson Security has**\npublished Snapchats previously\nundocumented developer\nhooks (APRO) and code for\n**two exploits that allow mass**\n**matching of phone number**\n**with names and mass creation**\nof bogus accounts.” ( ZDNet )\n\n\n-----\n\nAs an example of the complexities\nWassenaar introduces, in 2015 the ZDI\nworked closely with a number of trade\nlawyers and government officials to ensure\nCanada’s implementation of the Wassenaar\nArrangement was not violated during\nthe annual Pwn2Own contest held at the\nCanSecWest conference. To do so took\nmany months of security research and\ncommunication. With mere weeks to navigate\nthe complexity of obtaining real-time import/\nexport licenses in countries that participate\nin the Wassenaar Arrangement, the ZDI was\nunable to sponsor mPwn2Own at PacSecWest\nin November 2015.\n\n**Speculation on the impact to**\n**future research**\n\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement affects the\nsecurity research community today, and the\neffects will only increase in the coming years.\nAs the number of cyber-attacks continues\nto grow, there will likely be a corresponding\nresponse by governments to implement\nlaws on how the information security\nindustry operates. Considering the law of\nunintended consequences—the actions of\npeople/governments always have effects\nthat are unanticipated[20]—we can expect\nto see increased implementation of the\nWassenaar Arrangement and other legislation\nresulting in decreased efficacy in the security\ncommunity. The end result means creating\na better protection solution becomes harder\nand takes more time. This, in turn, increases\nthe likelihood of successful breaches as the\nenvironment favors those operating in the\nblack market.\n\n20 http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html.\n\n\n**Pros and cons of market participation**\n\nThe fundamental elements of trade are\nbuyers and sellers, along with the actual\nexchange of goods and services.\nAs in any market, if the number of buyers\nincreases, the number of sellers tends to\nincrease as well. In the case where there\nare incentives for criminal activities, a black\nor underground market often appears. As\nlong as there is someone willing to pay,\nthere will be someone willing to sell. Security\nresearchers and threat actors seek out\nvulnerabilities to improve their opportunity\nfor financial gain through the monetization\nof bugs. What differentiates the two is\nthe market they operate in, as discussed\npreviously. It is assumed that those selling\nvulnerabilities in the gray and black markets\ndo not execute the exploits themselves out\nof concern for their own safety. As more and\nmore legislation is being implemented, the risk\nof prosecution increases. Generally, there are\ntwo considerations for selling vulnerabilities\non the black market: the financial gain and\nthe risk of being caught by law enforcement.\nA third possible outcome, in all three markets,\nis “failure,” which occurs if others find and sell/\nreport the same bug. For the researcher—\nregardless of motivation—it comes down\nto risk tolerance. All three markets offer\nincreasing rates of return with a correlating\nincrease in risk of running afoul of the law.\n\n15 http://www.wassenaar.org/introduction/overview.html.\n\n16 http://www.wassenaar.org/introduction/index.html.\n\n\n###### Wassenaar effect on\n security research\n**Overview**\n\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement, implemented by\nmore than 40 countries, uses export controls\nas a means to combat terrorism.[15]\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement means\nto promote transparency and greater\nresponsibility in the transfer of conventional\narms and dual-use technology. The goal\nin doing so is to prevent destabilizing\naccumulations of both. Whether or not a\ntransfer is permitted or denied rests with the\nparticipating state and not with the governing\nbody. Each participant implements Wassenaar\nin accordance with its national legislation\nand policies.[16]\n\n**How it already affects research**\n\nWhere researchers operate in the marketplace\nis often driven by the country and laws they\nlive under. This is also true for customers in\nthe marketplace. Customers have become\nwary of the potential consequences of\nengaging with surveillance companies such\nas Hacking Team and Gamma International\nwhich sell to repressive countries.[17] The\nrecent inclusion of “intrusion software” under\nthe Wassenaar Arrangement seems to be a\nbacklash to offensive security offerings. In\nMay 2015 the US Department of Commerce’s\nBureau of Industry and Security (BIS)\nstepped into the fray by offering its proposed\nimplementation of the December 2013\nchanges for public comment. The proposed\nimplementation of the 2013 changes amended\ndual-use technologies to include security\nsystems—including intrusion software—for\nthe first time.[18] The BIS proposal included\nan incredibly broad set of controls related\nto intrusion software, so broad as to make\nmuch of today’s defensive cybersecurity\nresearch untenable—if not criminal—under\nthe revision. The outcry from the community\nhelped sway BIS into withdrawing its\nproposed changes and vowing to issue new\nlanguage in the future.[19]\n\n18 https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/we-must-fight-proposed-uswassenaar-implementation.\n\n19 http://www privsecblog com/2015/09/articles/cyber-national-security/\n\n\n-----\n\n### “Infosec has become incredibly important, as recent news amply demonstrates. As a society that depends heavily on technology we need to do much more to ensure that vendors ship securely designed products and are responsive to reports of vulnerabilities.” [21]\n\n\n###### Moving forward\n\nDuring the past 20 years, we have watched\nthe world change quite a bit. Just a decade\nago, most of the population didn’t know what\na breach was or that there were careers in\ncybersecurity. We’ve seen researchers step\ninto the spotlight and we’ve seen them shun\npublicity. There have been laws around\nresearch, copyrights, exports, and many other\ntopics. Today, with the “Year of the Breach”\njust past us, there is more legislation in the\n\n\nUS congressional pipeline than ever before,\nall trying to define “good hackers”\nand “bad hackers.” The vulnerability white\nmarket has had a tremendous positive\neffect in securing the landscape by bringing\nresearchers and vendors together and setting\nthe standard for coordinated disclosure. We\nexpect the white market will continue to\nevolve as more and more vendors announce\ntheir own programs to incentivize research.\n\n\nWe also anticipate regulations and legislation\nto impact the nature of disclosure. While\nthe environment in which the information\nsecurity community operates evolves, it is in\nall of our best interest to continue to find and\ndisclose security bugs in popular software so\nvendors can fix things in a timely manner. The\nincreasing complexity aside, it continues to be\nan endeavor we consider worth doing.\n\n\n21 http://community.hpe.com/t5/Security-Research/HP-Zero-Day-Initiative-Life-begins-at-10/ba-p/6770464.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The fragility of privacy\n\nThere was perhaps no clearer sign of privacy’s\nfragile situation in 2015 than the notice on\nthe International Association of Privacy\nProfessionals (IAPP) website in November,\nimmediately after the Paris, Kenya, and\nBeirut bombings.[22]\n\nThe IAPP Europe Data Protection Congress\n2015, which was scheduled to be held in\nBrussels during the first week of December,\nis not an insignificant conference. The\ntopics on its plate this year were mighty:\nthe then-recent upending of the US-EU\nSafe Harbor agreement; the continuing\nfallout from Edward Snowden’s surveillance\nrevelations in 2013; the role of encryption; and\nconversations concerning such rising topics\nas metadata, data localization, the Internet\nof Things (IoT), data sharing and breach\nreporting, and more.\n\nFigure 8. Posting on the IAPP website\n\n\nAnd yet it did not happen, and some who\nhad previously cited privacy as their reason\nfor offering certain services used by (among\nothers) the Islamic State/IS terrorists were\nceding their ground and changing their\nservices in the face of outrage over their\nuse.[23] By the end of 2015, privacy issues\nseemed dangerously close to decoupling\nfrom security issues in the mind of legislators,\nthe industry, and the public. At what would\nbecome a prophetic keynote talk during the\nCato Institute’s second annual Surveillance\nConference in October, Senator Patrick\nLeahy remarked:\n\n\n“There are some in Congress who want to\ngive our national security agencies a blank\ncheck. They think any attempt to protect our\nprivacy somehow makes us less safe. I hear\nmembers accept a framework of ‘balancing’\nprivacy rights and national security. But\nprivacy rights are pre-eminent. Protecting\nour basic privacy rights and protecting our\ncountry are not part of a zero-sum equation.\nWe can do both. But we have to keep in mind:\nIf we don’t protect Americans’ privacy and\nConstitutional liberties, what have we given\nup? Frankly I think far too much. And I think\nthis great nation is hurt if we do.”[24]\n\nPrivacy issues gave the security world much\nto discuss and ponder throughout 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\na lighthearted “S*fe H*rbor Naming Contest”\nto pre-christen the new arrangement.[34] While\nthis contest drew some creative entries,[35]\nit was later announced that the group was\nrecommending that the new arrangement\nbe called “The Transatlantic Data Protection\nFramework.”[36]\n\nThe US Department of Commerce, with\nwhich the original agreement was negotiated\nand which had been working for two years\nprior to nail down a stronger agreement,\ntermed itself “deeply disappointed” and\nvowed to work for a rapid upgrade to the\nproblematic frameworks.[37] The US House of\nRepresentatives passed the Judicial Redress\nAct giving certain foreign citizens the right\nto sue over US privacy violations related to\nshared law enforcement data, which chief\nsponsor Jim Sensenbrenner said explicitly\ncould help to mend US-EU fences.[38]\n\nAs this Risk Report went to press,\nthe target date for a new framework was\nJanuary 31, 2016. If no solution is found\nby then, “EU data protection authorities\nare committed to take all necessary and\nappropriate actions, which may include\ncoordinated enforcement actions.”[39] According\nto at least one European official, the likelihood\nof a solution in that time frame was not\ngood,[40] in which case business slowdowns and\neven very large fines would ensue.\n\n36 https://iapp.org/news/a/and-the-winner-is/.\n\n37 https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2015/10/statementus-secretary-commerce-penny-pritzker-european-court-justice.\n\n38 http://judiciary.house.gov/index.cfm/2015/10/goodlattesensenbrenner-and-conyers-praise-house-passage-of-legislation-tostrengthen-privacy-protections-for-individuals.\n\n39 https://www.technologyslegaledge.com/2015/10/breaking-newssafe harbor g29 issues its first statement on schrems/\n\n\n###### The swamping of Safe Harbor\n\nFor enterprises, international data-privacy\nissues years in the making came to a head in\nOctober when Europe’s highest court struck\ndown the pact that allowed US and European\ninterests to share data that has privacy\nconsiderations, specifically data that includes\nconsumers’ personally identifiable information\n(PII).[25] The EU has safe-harbor relationships\nwith various nation-states; the agreement in\neffect with the US had been in place\nsince 2000.[26]\n\nThe US-EU privacy climate has been tepid\nsince well before Edward Snowden’s data\nreleases in June 2013, but the case that\ntipped the EU justices’ scales was a result of\nSnowden revelations about the Planning Tool\nfor Resource Integration, Synchronization,\nand Management program, better known as\nPRISM, a program launched by the National\nSecurity Agency (NSA) in 2008.[27] Among\nthe data PRISM gathers is “audio, video and\nimage files, email messages and web searches\non major U.S. Internet company websites,”[ 28]\nincluding the likes of Google and Facebook.\n\nAustrian Facebook user Max Schrems filed\na complaint stating that Facebook’s Irish\nsubsidiary transferred data to the US and thus\npassed it through PRISM, in contravention\nof Europe’s rigorous privacy protections.\nThe Irish court agreed to look at the matter,\n\n25 https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/eucourt-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-deal-over-privacyconcerns/2015/10/06/2da2d9f6-6c2a-11e5-b31c-d80d62b53e28_story.\nhtml.\n\n26 Op. cit.\n\n27 http://uspolitics.about.com/od/antiterrorism/a/What-Is-Prism-InThe-National-Security-Agency.htm.\n\n28 Op cit\n\n\nand ultimately asked the European Court of\nJustice whether privacy watchdogs are bound\nto accept the original declaration that the\nUS is adherent to the standard set for Safe\nHarbor relationships. The EU court found that\nthe current Safe Harbor arrangement indeed\ndid not adequately protect user privacy rights,\nbecause it allowed US officials to gain access\nto user data even when European law would\nforbid it and allowed for data to move to thirdparty nations with which the Safe Harbor\nagreement was not in force.[29] The Irish data\nregulator was therefore free to investigate\nwhether the data transfer was properly\nhandled, and Safe Harbor was\nthus trumped.[30]\n\nCompanies on both sides of the Atlantic\nwere in an uproar, scrambling to put together\nalternate data-transfer mechanisms (that\nis, mechanisms that are protected by\nlegal devices, such as contractual dataprotection clauses, other than the Safe\nHarbor agreement) even as regulators\ncame knocking.[31] Specialized sectors such as\nhealthcare wondered if they would be able to\nexchange certain kinds of security research\ndata, while Internet titans such as Google and\nFacebook were warned[32] by representatives\nof the Article 29 Working Party, the entity\nthat oversees privacy matters in the EU,\nnot to get “too creative”[33] when plotting end\nruns around the ruling.

In the\nyears after 9/11, the tide of judicial and public\nopinion had turned against what many saw\nas vast overreach and even vaster failure to\nperform. In May, the US Second Circuit Court\nruled that the program to systemically collect\nAmericans’ phone records—specifically, the\nclause known as Section 215[42]—had never\nbeen properly authorized.[43 ]The Patriot Act\nexpired on June 1, and Section 215 with it. On\nJune 2, Congress approved the USA Freedom\nAct, which included a ban on those collection\nactivities.[44] Various Congressional attempts[45]\nto restore the program were unsuccessful, and\nthe ban took effect on November 29.[46]\n\nEven as the NSA has struggled to give the\npublic and Congress more transparency\ninto its workings,[47] evaluations indicate that\nthe bulk-collection program was a failure. A\nnumber of investigations[48] by various\ngovernment committees[49 ]and other\n\n\nobservers[50] described a broken program\nwith no provable success at pinpointing\ndata applicable to the stated task—that is,\nprotecting Americans from attack. The most\nsuccessful case spotted in the data—that of\na Somali man convicted of sending $8500\nto a group in his home country—involved no\nthreat of attack against the US.[51]\n\nEven the agencies themselves seemed\nnonplussed by the results of bulk data\ncollection. At a Cato Institute event, senior\nfellow John Mueller speaking on the efficacy\nof the programs (“Surveilling Terrorists:\nAssessing the Costs and Benefits”) noted\nthat the data has been proven remarkably\nineffectual at spotting terrorists.[52] Moreover,\nhe said, the very facts of the tidal wave of\ndata, coupled with the “9/11 Commission\nSyndrome” expectation that every lead must\nbe followed up regardless of implausibility,\nhas led to high levels of conflict between\nagencies, which resent the low-quality and\nirrelevant leads derived from the data.[53] He\nnoted a troubling brain-drain cost as good\ninvestigators become increasingly hopeless\nand paranoid as a byproduct of pointless\n“protection” efforts.[54]\n\n\n###### “Protecting our privacy rights and protecting our country are not part of a zero-sum equation.\n We can do both.”\n\n - Sen.

Those arguments were\ncountered by equally venerable arguments\nby crypto experts[67] about the certainty\nthat backdoors—or, worse, giant stores of\nunencrypted data—are a recipe for unwanted,\nsustained, and ultimately catastrophic\nattention from attackers.[68] At the time of this\nReport’s writing, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR)\nwas brushing off his proposed 2014 Secure\nData Act,[69] which seeks to ban governmentmandated tech backdoors.[70] One hardware\nmanufacturer left an entire market rather than\nbend to government demands for unfettered\nbackdoor access, as BlackBerry prepared\nto leave the Pakistan market at year’s end\nrather than expose its BlackBerry Enterprise\nService (BES) traffic to wholesale traffic\nmonitoring.[71]\n\n66 http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/24/the-encryption-debate-isnttaking-a-thanksgiving-break/.\n\n67 http://passcode.csmonitor.com/influencers-paris.\n\n68 http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/30/feds-wantbackdoor-into-phones-while-terrorists-walk-through-front-door.html.\n\n69 https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wydenintroduces-bill-to-ban-government-mandated-backdoors-intoamericans-cellphones-and-computers.\n\n70 https://medium.com/backchannel/encryption-is-not-the-enemyb5c1652e30b8#vmnu2lnj1\n\n\n-----\n\n72 http://www.law360.com/articles/621688.\n\n73 http://stixproject.tumblr.com/post/119254803262/a-history-ofstixtaxiicyboxmaec-news-media.\n\n\n75 http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/716526/groups-slam-bidto-use-cybersecurity-bill-to-expand-cfaa.\n\n76 https://fcw.com/articles/2015/11/09/information-sharing-isao.aspx.\n\n\n###### Information sharing\n\nThere are positive ways of sharing threat\ninformation, of course, and some progress\nwas made to build those systems. In February,\nPresident Obama signed Executive Order\n13691,[72] which details a framework to expand\nboth private sector and public-private sharing\nof information on threats and attacks. Such\nprograms have long been the goal of a\nnumber of public and private efforts. The STIX\nand TAXII framework standards, for instance,\nhave been around for years,[73] while several\ncommercial entities have attempted to build\nthe infrastructure and attract the critical\nmass necessary to make such entities a going\nconcern. Over the course of the year, the\nHouse and Senate worked on legislation[74] that\nwould protect companies engaged in such\nsharing, though as mentioned above at least\none senator made an attempt to piggyback a\nsurveillance project onto the Senate offering.[75]\nBy the end of the year, the Information\nSharing and Analysis Organization (ISAO)\nstandards group was holding public meetings\nto discuss next steps,[76] and various state[77] and\nlocal[78 ] entities were examining how they might\nparticipate, whether by standing up their own\nISAO groups as suggested by the Executive\nOrder or via some other means.\n\n###### Spotlight: three tech giants\n\nMany of the issues discussed so far in this\nsection center on broad, nation-state-type\nentities, but these issues also tended to touch\nthe largest technology businesses. The 2015\ncorporate accountability index published by\nRanking Digital Rights found that none of\nthe world’s highest-profile tech firms were\nparticularly trusted by their users. According\nto the results of the survey, the customers\nfound them lacking in transparency,\ninconsistent in their privacy disclosures,\nand generally ranging from not-great to\njust awful.[79]\n\nIn previous years, such companies as\nMicrosoft, Google, and Facebook had various\nincidents in privacy, and 2015 brought new\nvariations on that theme. We will touch on\nhow other sectors were affected (mainly by\nregulation and legislation) in the next section,\nbut for now let’s take a look at some of the\nissues these three corporate giants faced\nin 2015.\n\n78 http://www.law360.com/articles/699517/dhs-grants-ut-san-antonio11m-for-info-sharing-standards?article_related_content=1.\n\n79 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/03/data\n\n-----\n\n**Spotlight: Google**\n\nGoogle spent much of its year addressing\nrequests to remove well over one million\nURLs from search results in the wake of the\nEU’s May 2014 “right to be forgotten” ruling\n(Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja\nGonzalez).[80] At the time of this writing, the\ncompany had received over 350,000 requests\nand evaluated over 1.2 million URLs for\nremoval.[81] The company has declined just\nover half of those requests[82] and publicly\ndocumented its progress.[83] Interestingly, the\ndomain most frequently cited in removal\nrequests appears to be Facebook. Google has\nalso been fighting privacy-violations claims in\na suit consolidating two dozen smaller, similar\nsuits.

The\ncompany has been in court ever since and\npresented its argument to the Second Circuit\nin September.[85] The outcome, especially with\nSafe Harbor now in play, remains to be seen.[86]\nIn that suit, the company is arguing a position\nthat includes protection of its customers’ data.\n\n85 http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/699043.\n\n86 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/\nwp/2015/07/23/does-it-matter-who-wins-the-microsoft-irelandwarrant-case/.\n\n87 http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/723008.\n\n88 http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/\nfacebook-to-tweak-real-name-policy-after-backlash-from-lgbt-groupsand-native-americans-a6717061.html.\n\n\n**Spotlight: Facebook**\n\nFacebook is experiencing interesting\nchallenges with regard to its use of\ninformation this year.

The\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) in September\nreleased new cybersecurity regulations in\nthe wake of the OPM breach. These new\nregulations covered everything from breach\nreporting to log retention to cloud-related\nissues.[113] Later in the fall, it updated rules\npertaining to how IT contractors are brought\ninto their supply chain and how sensitive\ninformation may be shared with them.[114] The\nDepartment of Commerce (DoC) continued\nto fine-tune proposed rules controlling the\nexport of hacking tools; an open-comment\nperiod in May drew a large response[115] from\nsecurity researchers and firms already\nfeeling a Wassenaar[116]-related chill in the\nair. Commerce has so far given no date for\nrelease of a revised ruleset.[117] Meanwhile, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS)\nput out an end-of-year call for applicants\nto three-year appointments to its Data\nPrivacy and Integrity Advisory committee.[118]\nBy year’s end, the federal Office of\nManagement and Budget announced a\nFederal Privacy Council that will coordinate\nprivacy policies and strategies across multiple\ngovernment agencies.[119]\n\n111 http://www.commlawblog.com/2014/04/articles/broadcast/droneeven-go-there-on-newsgathering-drones-and-the-faa/.\n\n112 http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ctdrones-privacy-laws-20150803-story.html.\n\n113 http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/705295.\n\n114 http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/721375/pentagon-finalizescyber-risk-rule-for-sensitive-it-contracts.\n\n115 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/30/us_to_rethink_wassenaar/.\n\n116 http://www.wassenaar.org/publicdocuments/index.html.\n\n117 http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/702478.\n\n118 https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.\ngov/2015-30545.pdf.\n\n\nBeyond the US, international nation-specific\nefforts to think about data privacy (and\nsurveillance, and encryption) continued\neven as the US-EU Safe Harbor situation\nunspooled, and a full recounting on them\nis beyond the scope of this Risk Report.\nCross-border efforts to reach rule consensus[120]\nincreased as legislators and the general public\nworldwide finally got a look at the text of the\nTrans-Pacific Partnership,[121] which will be a\nmajor factor in 2016’s privacy story. However,\nthe trend toward data localization—that is,\nto require citizens’ data to reside in territory\ncontrolled by the nation of which they are\ncitizens—will likely affect privacy-protection\nefforts in new ways.[122] Earlier this year,\nAustralia accused China of hacking its Bureau\nof Meteorology. Over the years Australia’s\nmedia offices, power grids, and intelligence\nheadquarters have allegedly come under\nattack from the same quarter.[123] And to\ncomplete our circumnavigation of\nthe globe, in September the US and China\nsigned a bilateral anti-cyber espionage\naccord that raised eyebrows inside\ngovernment and beyond.[124, 125]\n\n120 http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/699125.\n\n121 https://ustr.gov/tpp/.\n\n122 http://www.law360.com/privacy/articles/698895.\n\n123 http://shanghaiist.com/2015/12/03/china_hacks_australian_\nweather_bureau.php.\n\n124 http://atimes.com/2015/11/counterintelligence-chief-skeptical-thatchina-has-curbed-spying-on-us/.\n\n125 http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/09/analysis-china-ushacking-accord-is-tall-on-rhetoric-short-on-substance/.\n\n126 http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202743330885/Anthem-FiresBack-at-Data-Breach-Suit?slreturn=20151030065146.\n\n127 http://mashable.com/2015/11/10/bank-data-breach-100\n\n###### Breaches in the news\n\nIf 2014 was the Year of the Breach, 2015 was\nthe Year of Collateral Damage, as certain\nattacks touched people who never dreamed\nthey might be present in, or identifiable from,\nthe data involved.\n\nIt was, as every year for years has been, a\nyear of new records.

The bulk of\nthe action took place in a quiet, intense catand-mouse game, with the affected parties\nlearning details after the fact. In contrast, the\nAshley Madison breach[148] was deliberately\nloud and messy—a previously unknown\nhacker, claiming moral authority over both the\nsite’s customers and its business operations,[149]\n\n142 http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/11/hacked-toymaker-leakedgigabytes-worth-of-kids-headshots-and-chat-logs/.\n\n143 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/13/smartbarbie-that-can-listen-to-your-kids-privacy-fears-mattel.\n\n144 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/26/hackerscan-hijack-wi-fi-hello-barbie-to-spy-on-your-children.\n\n145 https://fcw.com/articles/2015/08/21/opm-breach-timeline.aspx.\n\n146 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/world/asia/us-decides-toretaliate-against-chinas-hacking.html.\n\n\nunleashed a tidal wave of intensely personal\ndata[150]—in addition to the startling-to-most\nfact that an adultery-matchmaking site had 32\nmillion registered accounts, though perhaps\nnot all of them operated by actual humans.[151]\n\nThese breaches don’t initially look the same;\nhowever, both breaches had terrible effects\non people who never had direct contact\nwith the keepers of the data, and whose\ninformation appeared in it only as it related\nto someone else—or, in the case of the\nAshley Madison breach, did not appear at all\nbut whose identity could be easily deduced\nfrom revealed data (e.g., a spouse’s name\nand address would be knowable to a nosy\nneighbor if one spouse was registered on the\nsite under his or her true name[152]).\n\n148 http://fortune.com/2015/08/26/ashley-madison-hack/.\n\n149 Op. cit.\n\n150 http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/19/9179037/ashley-madison-datahack-name-address-phone-birthday.\n\n151 http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/31/ashley-madison-refutes-claimsthat-its-site-was-populated-with-fake-female-accounts/.\n\n152 http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2015/08/ashley-madisonusers-mapped.html.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Ashley Madison situation revealed\nnew levels of negative effect as individuals\nreacted to having the information put on\nblast. Stories of firings,[153] grief,[154] divorce,[155]\nruin,[156] and suicide[157] were all over the news,\nthereby intensifying public scrutiny of many\npeople who had no business relationship\nto Ashley Madison. One observer noted\nthat certain effects could be even more\ncataclysmic, because active-duty members of\nthe military found in the database could be\nsubject to dishonorable discharge—meaning\nthat unemployment and loss of pension are\ngenuine possibilities.[158]\n\nDespite the three years of credit counseling\noffered to persons whose names were\nrevealed in the OPM hack, it’s a relatively\ngood bet that the stolen data wasn’t\nmeant for the hands of criminal gangs or\nidentity thieves. Instead, the OPM hack\nbore a resemblance to a rash of hacks\nagainst newspaper reporters a couple of\nyears ago[159]—hacks that sought the names\nof reporters’ contacts, most likely those\ncontacts who are dissident to a particular\ngovernment.[160] It is believed that within\nthe rich trove of data taken were tens of\nthousands of Standard Form (SF)-86s, which\nare filled out by any service member or\ncivilian who seeks a security clearance.[161]\n\n153  http://nypost.com/2015/12/06/ashley-madison-hack-steals-mansjob-wife-and-mind/.\n\n154 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drs-bill-and-ginger-bercaw/thesad-irony-of-the-ashl_b_7868828.html.\n\n155 http://fusion.net/story/185647/ashley-madison-hack-victims/.\n\n156 http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/21/technology/ashley-madisonruined-lives/.\n\n157 http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/09/09/ashley-madison-suicidemarried-baptist-pastor-john-gibson/.\n\n158 Private conversation with retired military person who requests\nanonymity.\n\n159 http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/technology/washington\nt j i li t f di h k d b th hi ht l\n\n\nAs those who have gone through that\nscreening are aware, one provides a great\ndeal of information on the SF-86 about one’s\nfamily, friends, and associates[162]—for security\nand intelligence professionals, a delicate\nsituation. In other words, the true targets of\nthe breach may, again, be people who never\nthemselves consented to inclusion in the\nOPM database—and who may be in danger\nthanks to its compromise. (It is estimated\nthat the potential for damage could last\nfor over 40 years.[163]) In at least one case, it\nwas decided that a number of CIA officials\ncovertly stationed in a particular embassy\nneeded to be pulled precisely because they\ndid not appear in OPM files, as genuine state\nemployees would.[164]\n\n###### Déjà vu again\n\nA handful of 2015 incidents seemed to have\nreturned from a previous calendar.

As Bruce Schneier noted in his Cato\nInstitute keynote, “nobody here lies to their\nsearch engine.” In our current system, it’s\nrelatively easy for surveilling entities to obtain\ncourt permission to track certain kinds of\nrevealing activity because it’s classified as\n“just metadata.” The Columbia paper is\ndue out next year. A recently passed\ndigital privacy\n\nlaw in California, traditionally a leader in these\nmatters, also looks to an updated idea of\nwhat we mean by, and learn from, data that\nmay not be so “meta” after all. An amicus\nbrief filed with the Ninth Circuit Court in\nsupport of an appeal raised by Basaaly Saeed\nMoalin—the Somali man convicted in the\nsole successful Section 215 case mentioned\nabove—is also apt to shape our discussion of\nmetadata going forward.

The Year\nof the Breach was followed by 2015’s Year\nof Collateral Damage, as hacks exposing\npersonal information of people with no direct\nrelationship to the sites breached caused\npain and mayhem for tens of thousands\nof innocent bystanders. The US federal\ngovernment struggled with many privacy\nissues, even as the European Union and other\nentities pressed the accelerator on efforts\nto bring US companies in line with norms\noverseas. With geopolitical tensions worldwide\nas the year closed, it seems as if privacy issues\nwill struggle in 2016 to keep their rightful\nfooting side by side with security efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Vulnerability methods, exploits, and malware\n\nThe past year saw a record number of\nadvisories published by the ZDI.[204] While\nvendors continue to create patches to\naddress individual bugs, efforts have also\nbeen taken to provide defenses for entire\nclasses of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Take it to the source:**\n**vulnerability-specific mitigations**\n\nWhat happens when vulnerabilities are\ndiscovered? If everything works, patches are\nreleased. These patches typically comprise\npoint fixes that remediate the discovered\nissue. It is a never-ending cycle of activities:\n\n- Researcher uncovers zero-day\nvulnerability; reports to vendor.\n\n- Developers implement a fix.\n\n- Vendor releases a patch.\n\n- End user deploys a software update.\n\nAll of this activity costs a significant amount\nof money and requires numerous manhours to do correctly.[205] In the end, the user\nis secured from that vulnerability, which can\nno longer be used to breach a corporate\nnetwork—at least until the next vulnerability\nis discovered. With code bases reaching\nmillions of lines of code the next vulnerability\nis never far away.\n\n\n**What else can be done?**\n\nIn the past, vendors analyzed exploits\ndiscovered in the wild and engineered\ncountermeasures to combat the techniques\nused. Data execution prevention (DEP) and\naddress space layout randomization (ASLR)\nare classic examples of these mitigations\ndeveloped by vendors.\n\nThe DEP mitigation marks memory regions\nas executable or non-executable and denies\ndata the option to be executed in nonexecutable regions. DEP can be enforced by\nhardware (when it is sometimes known as the\nNX [No-eXecute] bit) as well as by software.\nWhen released, it was a formidable defense\nagainst the standard exploitation techniques\nof executing shellcode from an attackercontrolled buffer. Today, however, attackers\nhave several techniques to bypass DEP.\n\nOne common way is to use returnoriented programming (ROP) chains to\ncall VirtualProtect/mprotect and flag a\ncertain region as “executable.” To combat\nthis technique, vendors implemented ASLR\nto randomize the base address of loaded\ndynamic link libraries (DLLs), thus increasing\nthe difficultly in fielding a reliable exploit.\nAttackers could rely on the known addresses\nof ROP gadgets to disable DEP. With the\nintroduction of ASLR, attackers must either\nfind a way to load a non-ASLR DLL or to leak\na DLL address. With this new requirement for\nexploitation, vulnerabilities that disclosed the\nlayout of memory in a process became highly\nprized in the attacker community.\n\n\nThese types of mitigations were successful\nat breaking the common exploit techniques\nof the time, but attackers worked their way\naround the defenses. The cat-and-mouse\ngame between software vendors and exploit\nwriters continues with new exploit-specific\nmitigations being released and new\noffensive techniques quickly following.\nWhile these mitigations evolved, new\nvulnerabilities continued to be discovered\nand patches deployed. Recently, vendors\nthat receive hundreds of vulnerability reports\nbegan taking a different approach\nto software mitigations.\n\n\n-----\n\nallocated block of memory, MemGC fills\nthe memory with zeroes. This serves as an\neffective mitigation against UAFs. MemGC\nkeeps the memory in an allocated and\nzeroed state. Periodically, MemGC executes\na “recycling” operation to perform final\ndeallocation of all such memory blocks. A\nmemory block will only be recycled when no\nreferences remain, either on stacks or in other\nMemGC-tracked allocations.\n\nMemGC represents a highly effective\nmitigation. At the time of this writing, the vast\nmajority of use-after-free vulnerabilities in\nMicrosoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 are\nrendered non-exploitable by this mitigation.\n\n**New industry norms**\n\nFor complex code bases like web browsers,\nmitigations targeting the effectiveness\nof a common vulnerability type are a\nwelcome change. Fortunately, Microsoft\nis not the only vendor developing these\ntypes of countermeasures. Mozilla Firefox\nimplemented Frame Poisoning[212] and\nGoogle Chrome developed PartitionAlloc[213 ]\n\nto combat use-after-free vulnerabilities.\nThese mitigations increase the complexity\nof successfully writing a reliable exploit\nleveraging this style of vulnerability. The\nbrowser developers successfully disrupted\nthe threat landscape and forced attackers to\nadjust their tactics, which is the ultimate goal.\n\n211 https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-106.aspx.\n\n212 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=497495.\n\n213 http://blog.chromium.org/2014/08/64-bits-of-awesome-64-bitwindows 26 html\n\n\n**New mitigation strategy**\n\nMicrosoft’s flagship browsers, Internet\nExplorer® and Edge®, offer a unique case study\n\non this new approach to mitigations. Over\nthe years, use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities\nbecame one of the most common\nvulnerability classes in the browser.\nThey were the vulnerability of choice in\neverything from nation-state attacks to\ncommon campaigns launched from exploit\nkits.[206] In response to each one, Microsoft\nremediated and released patches for\nhundreds of UAFs. During this time, Microsoft\nnot only implemented point fixes but also\ndeveloped a new set of mitigations hoping to\neliminate this vulnerability class.[207]\n\n\ndeallocated as long as they are being\nreferenced directly on the stack or processor\nregisters. MemoryProtection guarantees\nthe block will remain on the wait list until\nreuse, and will remain filled with zeroes. This\nprevents an attacker from controlling the\ncontents of the freed block before it is reused.\nBoth of these mitigations had an immediate\nimpact on the use-after-free landscape by\nimplementing techniques to mitigate the\neffects of the vulnerability’s existence.\n\nIsolated heap and MemoryProtection were\nnot the only use-after-free mitigations in\nthe development pipeline at Microsoft.\nMemGC was introduced in Microsoft Edge\nand Internet Explorer browsers in Windows®\n\n10.[210] MemGC is a major evolutionary step,\nimproving upon the protections afforded\nby MemoryProtection. In October of 2015,[211]\nMemGC was additionally back-ported to\nInternet Explorer 11 running on earlier\nWindows versions.\n\nMemoryProtection only guards against\nreferences to freed objects residing on the\nstack or processor registers. In contrast,\nMemGC aims to provide protection to a\nfull-fledged managed memory solution by\nprotecting against references to freed objects\nregardless of where the reference may live.\n\nMemGC knows of all allocations made\nthrough the MemGC allocator.\nWhen application code requests to free an\n\n208 https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms14-035.\naspx.\n\n209 https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms14-037.\naspx.\n\n\nIn the summer of 2014, Microsoft introduced\ntwo new mitigations into its browser to\nincrease the complexity of successfully\nexploiting a UAF. June’s patch[208] introduced\na separate heap, called isolated heap, which\nhandles most of the document object model\n(DOM) and supporting objects. From a\ndefensive perspective, the isolated heaps\nmake it harder for an attacker to fill a freed\nobject residing inside the isolate heap region\nwith controlled values.\n\nMicrosoft released a subsequent patch[209]\nin July, 2014, introducing a new strategy\nfor freeing memory on the heap—\nMemoryProtection. This mitigation operates\nby preventing memory blocks from being\n\n206 http://community.hpe.com/t5/Security-Research/Microsoft-IEzero-day-and-recent-exploitation-trends-CVE-2014/ba-p/6461820#.\nVnQmo_mDFBc.\n\n207 https://securityintelligence.com/understanding-ies-new-exploit\ni i i h d h i l d h /\n\n\n-----\n\nAn attacker’s goal is to execute a privileged\nAPI (or security-restricted function) from\nwithin the “doc” context, providing the ability\nto execute unintended operations by strictly\nviewing the PDF. This needs to be completed\nwithout alerting the victim with a security\nwarning dialog. Surprisingly, attackers do not\nneed to resort to classic memory corruption\ntechniques to accomplish the goal. This can\nbe accomplished by simply understanding\nwhen the JavaScript language makes implicit\nfunction calls. These implicit calls allow the\nattacker to execute user-defined code in an\nunintended context.\n\n\n**Logical abuses of implicit calls**\n\nThere is no denying 2015 was the year for\nactive exploitation of Adobe Flash. This was\ndriven by the existence of an easy-to-use\nexploit primitive made available through\nthe corruption of vector objects and an\nabundance of UAFs in the code base. Given\nall this attention, Adobe Flash is being heavily\naudited by security researchers interested in\naiding in the fight against adversaries,[214] but\nit is not the only Adobe product receiving\nattention. Adobe Reader fixed a record\nnumber of vulnerabilities[215] in the 2015\ncalendar year.\n\nMost of the Reader vulnerabilities discovered\nreside in the code handling the JavaScript\nAPIs. These JavaScript APIs offer document\nauthors a rich set of functionality, allowing\nthem to process forms, control multimedia\nevents, and communicate with databases.\nThe primary purpose for this flexibility is to\ngive the end user easy-to-use yet complex\ndocuments. Unfortunately, this flexibility is\na perfect avenue for attackers. By thinking\noutside the box, an attacker can execute\nmalicious logic by leveraging weaknesses in\nthis code base.\n\nFigure 9. Adobe Reader security warning\n\n\nAdobe built a security boundary into these\nAPIs.[216] The boundary limits what type of\nfunctionality is made available to document\nauthors based on the mode in which the\napplication is operating. In Adobe Reader, this\nsecurity boundary is implemented based on\nthe concept of privileged and non-privileged\ncontext. When the code is executing in a\nprivileged context, the document author is\nallowed access to the subset of securityrestricted APIs. Examples of points within\nAdobe Reader where code executes in a\nprivileged context include operating in\nconsole mode, performing batch operations,\nexecuting application initialization events, and\ntrusting the document’s certificate. During\nthese times, the document author will have\naccess to the security-restricted APIs.\n\nSome examples of non-privileged APIs\ninclude mouse-up and mouse-down events\nand any functionality that can be executed\nin the “doc” context. A specific example of\na security-restricted API is app.launchURL.\nThis API should not be available from the\n“doc” context and should only be executed\nwhen you are in batch or console mode. If\nyou try to execute a privileged API from the\ndoc context, you will be prompted with the\nfollowing error dialog:\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing property redefinition techniques, the\nattacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary\nsecurity-restricted APIs from a context in\nwhich they are not allowed. Now all the\nattacker needs to do is find some interesting\nsecurity-restricted APIs to call. In this case,\nAdobe Reader’s undocumented APIs[217] fulfill\nthis exact requirement. The undocumented\nprivileged API Collab.uriPutData provides\nthe end user the ability to dump a file to\ndisk. Using the undocumented API, attackers\ncan either stash their payload in the victim’s\nstartup folder or drop a DLL in the disk.\nEither option allows them to gain remote\ncode execution of the victim’s machine.\n\n\nWith these exploit primitives, attackers\nhave everything needed to construct an\nexploit that achieves remote code execution\nthrough JavaScript API restriction bypass\nvulnerabilities. They begin their attack by\nattaching a malicious payload to a PDF. Next,\nthey write JavaScript that executes when the\ndocument is opened. The JavaScript needs\nto extract the contents of the attachment\ninto a JavaScript object. Following that, they\nleverage a JavaScript API restriction bypass\nvulnerability to execute the undocumented\nprivileged API Collab.uriPutData to drop a\nDLL to the disk. Once the DLL is dropped,\nthey force Adobe Reader to load the attackersupplied DLL and execute the payload.\n\n\nThis type of attack is devastating as there is\nlittle indication of compromise. In this case,\nthe attacker is not corrupting memory within\nthe application so the application will not\ncrash. No security dialog will be displayed\nto the end user to show that privileged\nfunctionality is being executed. The exploit is\nsimply redefining what methods are implicitly\ncalled within the JavaScript so that it executes\nunintended privileged APIs. These abuses\noffer an interesting case study of when using\nthe language as designed results in a security\nboundary failure.\n\n\nFigure 10. The result of successful exploitation\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The need for\n wide-reaching fixes\n\nWhile the fixes for use-after-free\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer\nand Edge are commendable, history\nteaches us it is only a matter of time before\nattackers leverage a different vector to\nexploit these programs. Still, the inclusion of\nMemoryProtection and MemGC demonstrates\nhow wide-reaching fixes disrupt attack in\nan asymmetric fashion. Instead of releasing\npatches to fix many different vulnerabilities,\nthese defensive measures take out the entire\nclass—at least for some period of time.\nOther vendors would do well to consider\nimplementing similar strategies to disrupt\nclasses of attacks.\n\n###### Exploits\n\nAs detailed in the “business of bugs” section\nearlier in this report, finding vulnerabilities\nin software is usually the domain of security\nresearchers, with many of them participating\nin coordinated disclosure with vendors.\nDespite the progress made with a recordsetting year (both reporting and patching),\nexploits remained one of the main vectors\nallowing remote code execution and privilege\nescalation by attackers.\n\nThe distribution of newly discovered\nsamples for vulnerabilities identified in 2015\n(CVE-2015-xxxx) shows the high prevalence\nof exploits for the Windows privilege\nescalation vulnerability CVE-2015-1701,[218]\nwhich accounts for over 45% of exploit\nsamples for the year. CVE-2015-1701, first\nobserved in a highly targeted attack,[219] was\nused in combination with Adobe Flash remote\ncode execution exploits.\n\n\n###### 2% 3% 3%\n\n\nCVE-2015-1701\nCVE-2015-2331\nCVE-2015-5119\nCVE-2015-0311\nCVE-2015-5122\nCVE-2015-1671\nCVE-2015-1692\nCVE-2015-3113\nCVE-2015-5097\nCVE-2015-0313\nOthers\n\n\nFigure 11. Top 10 CVE-2015 exploits by prevalence discovered by ReversingLabs\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking at vulnerable applications\n(Figure 12), however, the top 20 were\ndominated by Adobe Flash exploits. Indeed,\n2015 was fraught with newly discovered Flash\nvulnerabilities in spite of several security\nimprovements implemented by Adobe and\nMicrosoft Windows such as Control Flow\nGuard (CFG) and a more secure Action Script\nvector class. Out of the top 20 applications,\nhalf affected Adobe Flash. The most\ncommonly encountered Flash samples\ninclude two discovered after the Hacking\nTeam breach (CVE-2015-5119[220] and CVE2015-5122[221 ]), and a third (CVE-2015-0311[222 ])\nfound in the Angler exploit toolkit.[223]\n\nLooking at the proportion of samples\ndiscovered by ReversingLabs in 2015, it is\nMicrosoft vulnerabilities that dominate the\ntop 20, accounting for nearly 50% of all\ndiscovered samples, followed by Adobe Flash\n(29%) and a single PHP vulnerability (10%).\n\n\nFigure 12.

Looking at newly discovered exploit\nsamples for all known vulnerabilities, not just\nthose discovered in 2015, different patterns\nemerge. Alarmingly, 2015 is still dominated\nby CVE-2010-2568[224] (patched again in early\n2015[225]), although the overall proportion is\na bit lower (29% in 2015 vs. 33%in 2014). In\nfact, it is disheartening to see that the top 10\nvulnerabilities exploited overall (Figure 14)\ncontinue to be those that are more than a\nyear old (and 48% are five or more years old).\n\nSurprisingly, the old Shortcut Icon Loading\nVulnerability first discovered by VirusBlokAda\nduring the initial analysis of Stuxnet is\nfollowed by samples exploiting CVE-20126422,[226] a vulnerability in Samsung Exynos\nprocessors, which allows the attacker\nto escalate privileges by being able to\narbitrarily read and write system memory.\nThe prevalence of CVE-2012-6422 is likely\nindicative of the increased popularity of\nSamsung smartphones and the Android\noperating system.\n\nNow, let’s look at this from the perspective of\ntargeted applications and platforms. Again,\nthe data shows Microsoft Windows dominates\nwith more than 42%—largely attributed to\nthe Stuxnet vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568).\nConfirming our belief that attackers are\nvery much interested in mobile platforms,\nAndroid is second with 18%. Oracle Java (12%),\nMicrosoft Office (11%), and Adobe (Flash and\nReader at 7% each) round out the top five.\n\n\nFigure 14.

This is\na change from last year’s report when Java\nexploits were the second most prevalent,\naccounting for more than 21% of all\ndiscovered exploit samples.\n\nAlthough several vulnerabilities in JRE were\ndiscovered in 2015, none of them allowed\nremote code execution,[227] which lowers the\ninterest of malware attackers in Java. Combine\nthis with the fact that many people learned\nhow to disable Java from running within a\nweb browser[228] environment, and it is easy to\nunderstand why Java fell in 2015—at least as\na platform.\n\nLooking at only newly discovered exploit\nsamples delivered through web pages,\nthe situation is somewhat different as HTML\n(JavaScript) leads with 35%—more than\nAdobe Reader, Java files, and Adobe Flash\nfiles.\n\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nOracle Java 6\n\nMicrosoft Office 3\n\nWindows 3\n\nAndroid 3\n\nAdobe Flash 2\n\nAdobe Reader 2\n\nLinux 1\n\nFigure 16.

It’s important to\nnote that ReversingLabs’ number includes\npotentially unwanted applications (PUAs).\n\n\n160,000,000\n\n120,000,000\n\n\n80,000,000\n\n\n40,000,000\n\nFigure 18.

Even we\npredicted this in our 2015 report. It is difficult\nto pinpoint exact reasons for this apparent\nstagnation, but it’s likely due to improvements\nin defenses such as the operating system\nand protection components implemented in\nthe enterprise. Another contributing factor\ncould be the takedown of several large\nmalware operations in 2015.[230, 231] We can also\nreasonably attribute some percentage of\ndecline to the consumer shift from traditional\ncomputers to mobile devices. The centralized\ndistribution model for apps used by iOS and\nAndroid has proven more difficult for malware\nattackers despite the obvious growth in\ninterest in attacking mobile platforms.\n\nRegardless of increased interest in attacking\nmobile platforms, Microsoft Windows remains\nthe top platform for malware with 94%,\nas seen in Figure 19.\n\n\n###### 1% 1%\n\n 3%\n\nWindows\nAndroid\nDocument\nMSIL\nPHP (0)\nMacOS (0)\nLinux (0)\nPerl (0)\nUNIX (0)\n\n###### 94% iOS (0)\n\nFreeBSD (0)\n\nFigure 19.

Yearly growth in newly discovered malware samples by platform (ReversingLabs)\n\n\nThe only other platform of note here is\nAndroid, with 3% (or just over 4.5 million\nsamples). Of interest, Android’s (and other\nmobile platforms’) main threats are potentially\nunwanted applications (PUAs) and advertising\nframeworks collecting private and potentially\nidentifiable user information.\n\nExamining overall growth rates per platform,\nwe see a shift away from Windows-only\nmalware. The absolute champion, in terms of\ngrowth rate, was Apple iOS, with an increase\nof more than 230% (although the number\nof discovered Apple malware samples, just\nunder 70,000, is still very small compared to\nthe number of Windows malware samples) as\nseen in Figure 20.\n\n\nThe increase of interest in Linux can be\ncontributed to its popularity for hosting\nweb content.[232] Users of popular content\nmanagement applications such as\nWordPress[233] often fail to promptly update\nto the latest versions, allowing attackers\ntime to install malicious code on the server.\nThe growth of PHP-based samples can be\nattributed to remote administration (remote\nshell) tools exposed through a web-based\nuser interface.\n\nOverall, despite being a very serious\nproblem, we can be happy with a slowdown\nin Windows-based malware—at least for\n2015. Security features and mitigations as\naddressed earlier in this report are expected\nto further contribute to a stagnation in\nthe growth of malware and hopefully,\nan eventual decline.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Windows malware in 2015**\n\nLooking more closely at Windows malware,\nthe data reveals that self-replicating malware\nsuch as network worms and parasitic viruses\ndominate. However, most of the top families\nare not new, showing us that patching is still\nvery much a problem. Let’s look at the top two\nfamilies (Figure 21) more closely.\n\nAllaple[234] tops the charts with 26% of samples\nand is a polymorphic worm discovered more\nthan eight years ago that affects HTML\nfiles, which may contribute to such a high\nnumber of samples. Allaple is similar to Ramnit\n(infecting files other than Windows PE files),\nwhich accounted for almost 5% of the\nsamples despite being taken down in February\nby Europol.[235]\n\nElkern,[236] at 19%, is another surprise. Elkern\nis a polymorphic parasitic virus and worm\ndiscovered in the old era of viruses (over 10\nyears ago) when malware was created to\nshowcase the author’s technical skills or, at\nworst, overwrite or delete files.\n\nAlthough the growth in newly discovered\nmalware samples slowed, 2015 was not\nwithout innovation including malware\ndesigned to attack users in general,\nas well as malware designed to target\nspecific organizations.[237]\n\n234 http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.\n\nf ll l\n\n\n235 https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/02/27/europol-takedown-of\nb f ll f b l /\n\n\n###### 2%\n\n\n###### 2% 2%\n\n\nAllaple\nElkern\nMultiplug\nVirut\nVirlock\nRamnit\nMira\nVobfus\nUpatre\nSality\nOthers\n\n\nFigure 21.

Perhaps the most\ninteresting examples are Bitcoin stealers such\nas CoinThief[238] or Bitcoin mining malware,\nwhich uses a computer’s computing resources\nto mine Bitcoins for the benefit of the attacker.\n\nThe majority of threats on OS X, in fact over\n99% of all newly discovered threats, belong\nto the category of potentially unwanted\napplications (PUAs). They are usually\ninstalled in a bundle along with useful, wanted\napplications.[239] Once installed, PUAs often\ndownload and install additional components\nor display advertisements through browser\nplugins such as VSearch.[240] The most\ncommonly encountered OS X PUA is known\nas Macnist,[241] which encompasses several\ndownloader families.\n\nAlthough the malware protection module\nGatekeeper, built into the OS X operating\nsystem, is improving with every new release,\nthis year has seen a few successful attacks\ndesigned to bypass it.[242] We expect that the\nresearch in this area will continue in the\nnext year, as bypassing built-in security\nmechanisms is key to successfully installing\nmalicious software on OS X.\n\n238 http://www.securemac.com/privacyscan/new-apple-mac-trojancalled-osxcointhief-discovered.\n\n\n240 http://www.thesafemac.com/arg-vsearch/.\n\n241 https://cynomix3 appspot com/tag/not-a\n\n###### 1% 1% 1%\n\n 5%\n\nMacnist\n\n###### 30% Vsearch\n\nGenieo\nMac bundlore\n\n###### 62% Bundlore\n\nInstallcore\nGetshell (0)\nAgent (0)\nSpigot (0)\nOthers (0)\n\nFigure 22.

Most DDoS\nTrojans connect to a central command and\ncontrol (C&C) server used by the attackers to\nsynchronize denial of service attacks,\nusually conducted by choosing one of the\nwell-known[243] DoS methods such as TCP,\nUDP, and ICMP flood or DNS amplification.\n\nThe world of Linux malware, in terms of threat\n\ntypes, has not seen a major change from\nthe last year and DDoS malware continues\nto dominate the top 20 threats, accounting\nfor more than 60% of all discovered samples.\nA notable trend is the further increase in\n\ninfecting small office and home routers, which\nare often misconfigured or not updated with\nthe latest security patches. Several Linux\nmalware families spread in this manner with\nfunctionally identical executables designed to\nrun on different processor architecture, with\nMISP, ARM, x86, and PowerPC being the most\ncommon ones.\n\n\n###### 2% 2%\n\n 3%\n 8%\n\n 24%\n 61%\n\nDDoS\nGeneric\nBackdoor Trojan\nHacktool\nParasitic virus\nWorm\n\nFigure 24.

Top Linux malware samples discovered in 2015\n\n\nFirst discovered in 2014, the Linux malware\nfamilies Darlloz and Aidra[244] continued to\ntarget routers throughout 2015. Samples of\n\nboth families attempted to secure infected\ndevices from infection by another family,\nreminiscent of the Netsky, Bagle, and\nMyDoom wars,[245] which happened over 10\nyears ago.\n\nThis year, router-based malware has seen\n\nthe addition of the purportedly “benevolent”\nworm Wifatch,[246] which spread to unprotected\nrouters in an attempt to secure them\nfrom further infections with no malicious\npayloads included in its code. First mention\nof benevolent viruses was recorded in one of\nthe first-ever research efforts into computer\nviruses, published by Fred Cohen in 1984.\nIn his book “Computer Viruses—Theory\nand Experiments,”[ 247] Cohen describes a\ncompression virus,[248] which preserves the\noriginal function of the infected executables\n\nbut also saves disk space by compressing the\nhost code.\n\n244 http://now.avg.com/war-of-the-worms/.\n\n245 http://news bbc co uk/2/hi/technology/3532009 stm\n\n\nThe level of sophistication in Linux malware\n\nis still generally low, which can be attributed\nto the relatively low level of user awareness\nabout malware threats to Linux. An additional\ncontributing factor is the fact that antivirus software is rarely installed on Linux\nsystems. More advanced anti-debugging\nand obfuscation techniques are generally not\nused as they are typically not required when\ninfecting systems.[249]\n\nWith the further increase of Linux as a\npopular platform for hosting applications and\nthe adoption of software containers as a de\nfacto standard for packaging applications, it\nis likely we will see more sophisticated Linux\nmalware in the near future.\n\n246 http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/and-now-amalware-tool-that-has-your-back/d/d-id/1322451.\n\n\n248 http://all.net/books/virus/part2.html.\n\n249 http://www zdnet com/article/two stealthy linux malware samples\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 500,000\n\n 400000\n\n\n###### 300,000\n\n 200000\n\n\n###### 100,000\n\n 0\n\n\nFigure 25.

Top Android malware families discovered by ReversingLabs in 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n**Android ransomware**\n\nRansomware is a very successful model of\nattack and its mobile variant is not much\ndifferent from its desktop counterpart. Usually,\nthe user is tricked into installing a useful\napp—for example, an app that pretends to\n\nbe Adobe Flash player.[251] Once installed and\nexecuted, the malicious application attempts\nto encrypt all accessible documents, images,\nand multimedia files on the device. When\nthis process is finished, the ransomware\napplication displays a text, a warning that\noften seems to come from law enforcement\nagencies such as the FBI[252] and instructs the\nuser how to pay to restore files and access\nto the device.\n\n\n50\n\n\n350\n\n300\n\n\n250\n\n200\n\n\n150\n\n100\n\n\nSome of the most successful Android\nransomware families are Simplocker[253] and\nKoler.[254] The recently discovered Locker[255]\nfamily actually sets a PIN for the device and\nmakes the restore almost impossible if the\nuser is not willing to pay the attackers for\nrecovery instructions.\n\n**Banking (phishing) malware**\n\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n\nFake Internet banking apps are another\nsuccessful attack pattern that uses purported\n\nbanking apps to steal user credentials and\nallow attackers access to user’s bank accounts.\nThe fake banking app attacks often targeted\n\nKorean,[256] Russian, Indian, or Vietnamese\nbanks.[257] In Korea, users received spoofed\nSMS messages that enticed them to install\nthe fake app, which led to loss of banking\ncredentials. In other cases, such as those\n\ninvolving the Zeus malware,[258] fake apps\nrequired users to enter a code to access\nonline banking while forwarding the access\ncode to the attacker by sending a background\nSMS message.\n\n251 https://blog.avast.com/2015/02/10/mobile-crypto-ransomwaresimplocker-now-on-steroids/.\n\n252 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/26/android_ransomware_\nmobile scam fbi/\n\n\n254 https://blog.malwarebytes.org/mobile-2/2014/05/difficulty-removingkoler-trojan-or-other-ransomware-on-android/.\n\n255 http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/09/10/aggressive-androidransomware spreading in the usa/\n\n\n800\n\n600\n\n\n400\n\n200\n\n\n0\n\n\nFigure 27.

Top malicious iOS apps discovered in 2015\n\n\n**Information-stealing malware**\n\nPhone numbers, email addresses, and other\ncontact details are valuable for malware\nwriters. Many malicious applications,\nincluding PUAs, will attempt to collect this\ndata from infected devices and send it to\nattackers. Apart from sending SMS messages\nto invite users to install malicious apps, some\nattackers also spread them through\nTwitter and WhatsApp messages.[259] In Japan,\na group behind the Godwon information\nstealing malware collected the contact\ndetails to try to extort the user[260] after sharing\ncompromising photos and videos with\nattackers.\n\n259 https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2015/01/06/socialpath/.\n\n260 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/online-criminal-groupuses-android-app-sextortion.\n\n261 https://developer.apple.com/xcode/.\n\n\n**iOS malware**\n\nDue to the popularity of the platform,\nresearchers have been investigating all\nfactors of the security of the iOS platform\nsince its release. However, until 2015, we have\nnot seen any successful malware attacks get\n\ninto Apple’s closely guarded App Store.\n\nUnfortunately, this year witnessed the first\nmajor compromise of applications uploaded\nto the App Store. This is a consequence of\nan attacker’s modification of Apple’s Xcode[261]\nprogramming environment, which was shared\namong many developers in China.[262] This\nresulted in a malicious information-stealing\ncomponent, known as XcodeGhost,[263] being\n\nincluded with more than 4000 apps[264]\npublished to the App Store by legitimate\ndevelopers of IOS apps.\n\n263 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/09/novel-malwarexcodeghost-modifies-xcode-infects-apple-ios-apps-and-hits-app-store/.\n\n264 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/executive-perspective/2015/09/\nprotecting_our_custo.html.\n\n265 http //researchcenter paloaltonet orks com/2015/10/ ispecter first\n\n\nWhile XcodeGhost managed to get into\nApple’s App Store, two additional families\n\ntargeting third-party app stores for jailbroken\nphones became prevalent: Yispecter[265]\nand Keyraider.[266] Interestingly all major iOS\nmalware families are geographically targeting\nChinese and Taiwanese users.[267]\n\nAlthough the total number of IOS malicious\napps is very low compared to all other\npopular malware platforms, the growth of\n235% indicates that it should be a closely\nwatched area in 2016.\n\n266 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/08/keyraider-iosmalware-steals-over-225000-apple-accounts-to-create-free-app-utopia/.\n\n267 http://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/20/xcodeghost-chinesemalware-faq/.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Spotlight: significant malware in 2015\n\nJust as the marketplace grows for\n\nvulnerabilities, malware in 2015 took on a new\nfocus. In today’s environment, malware needs\nto produce revenue, not just be disruptive.\nThis has led to an increase in ATM-related\n\nmalware, banking Trojans, and ransomware.\n\n**ATM malware prevalence and trends**\n\n2015 bore witness to a steady increase in\nautomated teller machine (ATM)-related\nattacks. While not new-ATM malware attacks\n\nhave existed since 2004[268]—they have risen\nin frequency exponentially the past few\nyears.[269] ATM-targeting malware, as reported\n\nby our telemetry, occurs in moderate\nbut still alarming numbers. Due to the\noscillated nature of targeted platforms, once\ncompromised they appear on the radar of\nAV companies and major news feeds. These\nattacks are most likely only reported back to\nthe banks and ATM manufacturers, making it\ndifficult to gather reliable telemetry.\n\nAttacks targeting ATMs generally fall into one\nof two categories:\n\n- Stealing credit card information. These\nattacks may use hardware such as\nskimmers, software loaded onto the\nATM, or a combination of both.\n\n- Directly dispensing cash. These\nattacks rely on directly bypassing card\nauthentication and are performed at the\nsoftware level.\n\nWhile there’s no definitive answer as to what\ncontributes to the rise of ATM malware, it\n\nis likely that an aging ATM fleet plays a\nsignificant role. The ease of access to the\n\ninner workings of certain ATMs and their\nlocations contribute as well. What is certain\nis that cybercriminals attacking ATMs are\nwell-organized and operate on an\ninternational scale.[270]\n\n269 http://newsroom.mastercard.com/2015/05/11/security-matters-thecontinuous-evolution-of-atm-fraud-attacks/.\n\n270  http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/atm-heist-a-8178.\n\n271 http://www.cen.eu/Pages/default.aspx.\n\n\n**Targeted platforms**\n\nATM software architecture follows the design\nof the common architecture and consists of\nthe following major blocks:\n\n- Hardware modules\n\n- Service providers’ drivers for hardware\nmodules\n\n- Financial services extension (XFS)\nmanager\n\n- Business application\n\nMaintained and promoted by the European\nCommittee for Standardization[271] (CEN), the\nXFS manager is based on earlier work of\nWindows Open Architecture Extension for\nFinancial Services by Microsoft (WOSA/XFS).\nThe CEN/XFS manager communicates to the\nservice providers, which in turn implement\ndevice drivers for particular hardware\nmodules. In doing so, CEN/XFS abstracts a\n\nbusiness application (e.g., money dispenser,\nsecure crypto-processor, a money vault, a\npin-keyboard, a card reader, a printer) from\nATM hardware modules by providing a set\nof standard APIs. The business application\nreceives, interprets, and acts on user inputs\nultimately rendering services exposed by\nthe ATM. Ninety-five percent of ATMs use\na locked down version of Windows XP,[272]\ndespite the fact that Windows XP is no longer\nsupported by Microsoft.[273] The ATMs are not\nexpected to be connected to the Internet\nwithout an encrypted transport layer, such as\na Cisco VPN tunnel.[274] Small ATMs found in\n\nkiosks, small shops, and service stations can\nalso utilize proprietary telemetry links using\nISM bands[275] or phone lines.\n\n272 http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/04/technology/security/atmwindows-xp/.\n\n273 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xpsupport.\n\n274 http // cisco com/c/dam/en/ s/td/docs/sol tions/Verticals/\n\n\n**ATM malware prevalence**\n\nStandalone ATMs do not typically run\nendpoint security software or provide any\ntelemetry to gain knowledge about the\nprevalence and distribution of malware. For\n\ninsight into the prevalence and distribution\nof ATM malware, we monitored the crowdsourced sample gateway VirusTotal.[276]\nOperating under the assumption that\nmalware targeting ATMs has a high\nprobability of traversing client systems\nand being spotted by users or AV engines\n\nbefore installing, as well as knowing that the\nXFS manager is implemented via msxfs.dll\n(in the Microsoft Windows environment) a\nsimple YARA[277] rule was crafted to identify\nfiles linked with msxfs.dll and importing a\nset of XFS APIs common to known ATM\nmalware. We limit our observations to three\ncommon AV engines—Kaspersky, Microsoft,\nand ESET—based on the prevalent number\nof malware detections and the uniqueness\nand consistency of chosen malware names.\nIt is important to note that the simplified\nATM malware files selection rule would not\nexclude legitimate XFS applications infected\n\nby viruses. As such, these were carefully\nexamined and filtered out. Further analyzing\nsourced files revealed the following ATM\nmalware landscape throughout 2015.\n\n275 http://www.conceptdraw.com/examples/diagram-example-atmsystem.\n\n276 https://www.virustotal.com/.\n\n277 https://plusvic.github.io/yara/.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 1% 1% 1% 3%\n\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Suceful.a\nBackdoor.MSIL.Tyupkin.a\nBackdoor.MSIL.Tyupkin.c\nBackdoor.Win32.Tyupkin.h\nTrojan-Banker.Win32.GreenDispenser.c\nTrojan-Banker.Win32.GreenDispenser.d\nBackdoor.Win32.Tyupkin.g\nBackdoor.Win32.Tyupkin.d\nBackdoor.MSIL.Tyupkin.b\nBackdoor.Win32.Tyupkin.c\nTrojan-Banker.Win32.GreenDispenser.a\nTrojan-Banker.Win32.GreenDispenser.b\nBackdoor.Win32.SkimerNC.a\nBackdoor.Win32.Atmmng.a\nTrojan-Banker.Win32.GreenDispenser.e\nWorm.Win32.Huhk.c\n\n\nThe total number of samples within a\n\nmalware family reflects all cases submitted\nto VirusTotal over the course of the year,\n\nincluding non-unique submissions and\nrepresentation from different geographical\nregions. Having a ratio of unique\nsubmissions relative to the total number\nof samples, coupled with the geographical\n\ninformation for each individual submission\nsource gives us a sense of prevalence\nand distribution for a particular malware\nfamily. Of particular note, the total number\nalso reflects the readiness of AV engines\nto detect the sample at the time of the\nsubmission and does not take into account\nthe subsequent re-scans.\n\nWhen comparing these AV engines,\nKaspersky’s provides the best results based\non granularity of malware identification.\n\nUsing Kaspersky’s AV engine as a baseline,\nand layering the overall distribution and\nnumber of detected files within individual\nmalware families, a few interesting cases\nemerged.\n\n\nFigure 30.

The first file\noriginated in Russia at the end of August\n(08/28/2015). Later submissions of the\nsame file were made from countries such\nas Germany, India, Ukraine, Netherlands,\nMalaysia, Italy, South Republic of Korea, and\nTaiwan. The last submission occurred on\n\nSeptember 19 from Korea.\n\nThe second file was submitted just one\n\nminute later on August 28 and originated\n\nin France. It might suggest a check by\nthe malware actors using Internet proxies\nfor anonymization, or it may just be a\ncoincidence. The later submissions of this\n\n\nsame file were made from India, Ukraine,\n\nMalaysia, Netherlands, and Taiwan. As seen\nin the first case, the whole distribution took\nabout a month with the last submission made\non September 23. The monthly lifespan likely\n\nindicates that most of the AV engines have\ncaught up with the malware. It could also\nmean the malware finished its transitions\nthrough gateways and now resides on\nendpoints, such as ATMs, which are not\nroutinely scanned.\n\nThe third file is likely a continuation of the\ncampaign started in July. There are only two\nsubmissions made, both on September 21\nand originating from Vietnam.\n\nSuch a broad range of countries of origin\nsuggests a very wide and multinational\ndistribution as well as possible involvement of\nan organized group or groups of actors.\n\n\nThe malware is written in Delphi.[278] The\n\nprevalent language of the file resources\nsuggests a Russian-speaking country as\na point of origin. The malware uses the\n\nWFSAsyncExecute API and also employs\nthe WFSOpen, WFSStartup WFSExecute\nAPIs from the msxfs.dll library. References\n\nto Pinpad, IDCardUnit, RequestID,\nDBD_MOTOCARDRDR, Key-ENTER, KeyCANCEL, Key-CLEAR as well as other\nXFS-related strings suggests ATM card\nreader manipulations. The malware derives\n\nits name from a typo made in an internally\nused return status string (SUCEFUL) during\na successfully executed operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**AKA Tyupkin**\n\nThe name Backdoor:MSIL/Sidkey.A is used\nby Microsoft AV and covers most variations\nof the Backdoor.Win32.Tyupkin and Win32/\nPadpin families as identified by Kaspersky’s\nand ESET-NOD32 AV engines respectively.\n\nThis family of malware is not new, yet it\npersisted throughout 2015 despite its\nrelatively high rate of detections by AV\nengines. In April 2015, a file detected as\nBackdoor.MSIL.Tyupkin, a variant flagged\nby Kaspersky AV, was submitted. The first\nsubmission of the file came on April 9 and\noriginated in Russia. Again, judging by the\nfile’s prevalent language and the initial locale\nof submission, it is fair to say that the malware\nwas likely targeting Russian-speaking\nregions. As suggested by the detection name,\nthis malware was written using the .NET\nframework and utilizes XFS framework for its\nmalicious purposes. The most prevalent file\nname for this variant seen in the wild is ulssm.\nexe, which is hardcoded in the malware.\nSeveral notable XFS functions utilized by this\nsample are: WFSExecute, WFSFreeResult,\nWFSGetInfo, WFSIsBlocking, WFSOpen, _\nwfs_pin_data, _wfs_pin_func_key_detail,\n_wfs_pin_getdata, _wfs_result, WFSStartUp,\n_wfsversion, WFSCancelBlockingCall, _wfs_\ncdm_cu_info, _wfs_cdm_denomination,\nand _wfs_cdm_dispense.\n\n\nThe names of the APIs used suggest this\nmalware is focused on pin-pad and money\ncassette dispenser manipulation. Other\nsubmissions of this variant came from the\nUnited States, Israel, Malaysia, Great Britain,\nFrance, Taiwan, Estonia, Indonesia, Czech\nRepublic, and Brazil with the last submission\nmade on July 18, originating in France.\n\nThe Tyupkin malware family proved to be\npopular among attackers. One recent and\npersistent submission is a Tyupkin.h variant.\nThe first submission of this variant was made\non April 15 and originated in China. The\nmost recent was from Italy and submitted on\nNovember 4. From the dynamic of submission\nwe observed it appears as if the different\nvariants were released nearly simultaneously\ntargeting different geographical regions.\nSome of the variants proved to be more\npersistent continuing to appear in the wild at\nthe time of this writing.\n\nAs with the previously mentioned Suceful,\njudging by the exported XFS functions and\nservices, Tyupkin is very pervasive and\nattempts to dispense cash from the ATM to\nthe attackers. At this time, known variants of\nTyupkin do not attempt to manipulate or steal\nthe user’s card.\n\nDespite the high detection rate by AV\nengines, this malware family still manages to\npersist and due to its international prevalence\nand efficacy[279] is most likely used by organized\ncrime groups mostly targeting NCR ATMs.\n\n\n###### The names of the APIs used suggest Tyupkin is focused on pin-pad and money cassette dispenser manipulation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**AKA GreenDispenser**\n\nThis family of malware first came to\nlight in the beginning of June 2015. The\nfile is detected as Trojan-Banker.Win32.\nGreenDispenser.A, a variant of Win32/ATM.B,\nand Trojan:Win32/Greeodode.A by the\nKaspersky, ESET-NOD32, and Microsoft AV\nengines respectively.\n\nAs well as its predecessor Tyupkin,\nGreenDispenser targets NCR ATMs and\nonce installed dispenses unauthorized cash\nto malevolent actors.[280] It is written in C and\nimports the WFSGetInfo, WFSFreeResult,\nWFSOpen, WFSClose, WFSExecute,\nWFSStartUp, WFSIsBlocking APIs from the\nMSXFS.dll. It includes functionality to delete\nitself on request and simulate the ATM out-ofservice message. The malware can be limited\nto act within a certain time frame to reduce\nexposure and the chance of being detected.\n\nThe initial submission to VirusTotal was\nmade on June 4 and originated in India. Later\nsubmissions were made from the United\nStates, France, and Japan. These submissions\noccurred more or less evenly throughout\nthe following months up to September 29.\nThe later variations of the GreenDispenser\nTrojan family included Trojan-Banker.Win32.\nGreenDispenser.b, Trojan-Banker.Win32.\nGreenDispenser.c, and the Trojan-Banker.\nWin32.GreenDispenser.d as detected by\nKaspersky AV.\n\nThe Trojan-Banker.Win32.GreenDispenser.b\nsubmissions started in the second half of\nJune, originating in Mexico, and ran up until\nthe end of September. The submissions were\nmade from sources in Japan, Netherlands, and\nFrance.\n\nThe Trojan-Banker.Win32.GreenDispenser.c\nvariant submissions were only seen in\nSeptember and covered regions such as\nFrance, Netherlands, and Mexico.\n\nThe final variant, Trojan-Banker.Win32.\nGreenDispenser.d, was initially seen in\nJune with the first sample submitted on\nJune 11 from a source in Mexico. Additional\nsubmissions began in August and continued\nuntil the beginning of October from countries\nsuch as Japan, France, the United States,\nand Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\n**From point of sale to point of steal**\n\nATM malware prevalence is on the rise\n\nin 2015 compared to 2014. ATM malware\ntargets financial institutions directly and\nadds to an already hefty portfolio of attacks\non financial services such as credit card\nskimming devices and point-of-sale (PoS)\ncredit card information memory scraping.\nThe ATM attacks expose weaknesses in\nATM infrastructure such as a lack of regular\nmaintenance, misplacement of the service\n\nkeys that allow easy access to the ATM\nsoftware, the use of unsupported and\nmisconfigured operating systems, and the\nabsence of regular checks by AV solutions.\nSome of the attacked ATMs were located\nwithin convenience stores. Many of these\nstores run extended business hours and\nprovided an easy target during evening and\nnight hours of operation when such locations\nare less crowded. As seen in the prevalence\nand the geographical distribution data, the\nproblem is truly global and the attacks are\nwell organized. As a precaution, banks should\nconstantly review the physical security[281] of\nATMs in addition to updating the software\n\nthat controls and protects the machines.\n\n\n**Banking Trojan takedowns do little to**\n**stem the scourge**\n\nIn October, the banking Trojan Dridex\ngenerated a fair amount of public attention\nas the FBI, Department of Justice, the UK\nNational Crime Agency, and a number\nof other European law enforcement and\ntechnology companies announced the arrest\nof an administrator and the disruption of\nthe botnet’s command and control (C&C)\nservers.[282] Dridex evolved from the Cridex\nTrojan, which itself is based on the Zbot/Zeus\nTrojan.[283] These newer versions better protect\n\ntheir communications and disseminate\nthemselves more efficiently than their\npredecessors. The C&C networks of Zeus\nand related banking Trojans are typically\nencrypted and peer-to-peer capable. They\nutilize domain-name generator algorithms\n(DGAs) and a host of other anti-interception\ntechnologies to maintain the online presence\nrequired for continued operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n120,000\n\n80,000\n\n\nAny\nSophos\nKaspersky\n\n\n40,000\n\nFigure 33. Banking Trojan detections in VirusTotal\n\n\nDridex infections often begin with a Microsoft\nOffice macro chaining together multiple\nscripts, usually JavaScript or PowerShell, to\nsolicit a download of the main executable.\nThe sample W2KM_DRIDEX.YYSPE\ndemonstrates implementation. This case is\n\njust one of many where the Visual Basic for\nApplications (VBA) macro invokes a base64encoded PowerShell to construct JavaScript,\nwhich then builds x86 shellcode that solicits\nthe download. Automated file scanning of\nsuch documents is made particularly difficult\ndue to this blending of technologies and\n\nlayering, which renders the malicious payload\nopaque to static analysis.\n\nThe continued success of these Trojans\n\nis likely due to the combination of two\nfactors. The malware uses Microsoft\nOffice documents rather than executables\nto disseminate itself. While many users\n\nhave learned not to run programs from\nunknown sources, they are still likely to open\ndocuments. The Trojans also explicitly pack\n\n\nan executable. Anti-virus engines are more\n\nlikely to identify a clearly packed file and flag\nit. This behavior resulted in a new approach\nby the malware authors. The surreptitious\nembedding of unpacking code in what\nappears to be high-level-language (HLL)\ncompiled code, complete with WinMain, APIs,\n\nlibrary code such as printf(), can fool even\nhuman analysts. This use of HLL compilers\ngives the malware binary an initial allure of\n\nlegitimacy. However, it is the source-level\nobfuscation, realistic binary constructs, and\n\nlooser emulation context that collectively\ncontribute to resisting current generic\ndetection strategies.\n\nAiding the distribution of banker malware is\n\nthe resurgence of the Office Macro, which\nappears to be making a comeback.[284] This\ncomes as no surprise, because finding\nand exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in\nOffice applications is not as trivial a task as\ncompared to obfuscating a bit of VBA.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt appears that Microsoft Office Word\ndocuments and Excel[®] spreadsheets remain\nthe favored attachments. Many businesses\nuse these programs to conduct day-to-day\noperations, which provides a broad user\nbase for attackers to target.\n\n**Ransomware**\n\nThis past year saw a number of ransomware\n\nfamilies, including Cryptolocker,[285]\nCryptowall,[286] CoinVault,[287] BitCryptor,[288]\nTorrentLocker,[289] TeslaCrypt,[290] and others,\n\nwreaking havoc by encrypting files of private\nand corporate users alike. Once encrypted,\nthe malware author typically demands\nransom in exchange for decryption keys\nrequired to restore the files. In coordinated\ntakedowns between law enforcement and\nsecurity researchers, some ransomware\noperations were stopped, or at least slowed.\nThis often includes taking over the command\nand control infrastructure, which contains the\ndecryption keys. One excellent example is the\nCoinVault takedown by Kaspersky Labs and\nthe Netherland National High Tech Crime,[291 ]\n\nwhich exposed over 14,000 decryption keys.\n\nThe best protection against ransomware\n\nis a sound backup policy for all important\nfiles on the system. By default, Windows\nkeeps shadow copies of the files in the user’s\nhome folder. Sometimes the system can\nbe recovered from a ransomware attack by\nrestoring shadow copies, but ransomware\nauthors will try to disable shadow copy\nrestores by deleting them.\n\n285 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cryptoransomware-sightings-and-trends-for-1q-2015/.\n\n286 http://www.computerworld.com/article/3012101/security/ponyangler-and-cryptowall-mixed-into-dangerous-cyberthreat-cocktail.html.\n\n\n287 https://securelist.com/blog/virus-watch/67699/a-nightmare-onmalware-street/.\n\n288 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/02/kaspersky_announces_\ndeath_of_coinvault_bitcryptor_ransomware/.\n\n\n###### 1% 2%\n\n 26%\n\n 58%\n\n 16% 77%\n\n\ndoc\ndocx\nxls\nxlsx\n\nFigure 34.

Over\nthe past year, there has been a general\nshift from wholesale packing of malware\nexecutables toward better utilizing the\n\ninherent strengths of high-level language\ncompiled binaries (i.e., HLL/C, MFC, .NET,\nVisual Basic, etc.) and off-the-shelf scripting\nengines (i.e., AutoIt, cscript, vbscript,\n\nPowerShell, etc.). Regardless of the type of\nmalware, this combination provides a new\n\nlevel of difficulty in detection and eradication.\n\nBinaries compiled in .NET, Visual Basic, and\nMFC are less trivial to emulate and traverse.\nThis allows for malicious functionality to be\n\nmore easily hidden, from both inexperienced\nmalware analysts and automated scanning\ntools.\n\n\nexe\nmacro\nexploit\n\n\n290 https://securelist.com/blog/research/71371/teslacrypt-2-0disguised-as-cryptowall/.\n\n291 https://noransom.kaspersky.com/.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Outlook for 2016**\n\nIncreasingly skillful cybercriminals seem\nhighly motivated and intent on stealing our\nidentity, emptying our bank accounts, and\nholding our data for ransom. This threat\nis compounded by the ever increasing\ncomplexity of running a modern IT enterprise.\n\nFor businesses and their IT departments,\nvigilance needs to be fortified with action\nand preparedness.\n\nEnd users and security professionals alone\nshould not be shouldering the burden\nof ensuring the storage and integrity\nmanagement of data. Security product\nvendors must become as nimble as the\nadversary by staying abreast of the multitude\nof emerging techniques—even while\nconstrained by existing business factors.\n\nProgramming errors, system oversights,\nill-conceived features, and poor QA are not\nassisted by time-to-market and resourcing\npressure justifications. The adversary is\ndetermined. The defense must be more so.\n\n\nFigure 35. Languages used in malware creation 2011–2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conclusion\n\nWhile the apparent stagnation in the overall\ngrowth of malware is an unexpected positive,\nthe slow shift of focus away from Windows\ntoward Linux, Android, and OS X means the\noverall attack surface for malware continues\nto grow. While always disruptive, today’s\nmalware has become focused more on\nmoney than disrupting services. For these\nnon-Windows platforms, malware often\ntakes the shape of potentially unwanted\napplications, which could confuse a nontechnical user as to what is or isn’t malware.\nThis is especially troubling given the first\nsigns that Apple’s walled-garden application\nstore approach may not be infallible. While\nthe anticipated flood of attacks on Internet of\nThings (IoT) devices has yet to occur, attacks\non home routers[292] may be a precursor of\nthings to come.\n\n\nThe ever-present ATM has become the focus\n\nfor many types of attacks, with malware\nauthors targeting the users of ATMs and the\nmachines themselves. While there have been\ncoordinated law enforcement takedowns\nof banking Trojan infrastructure, statistics\nshow the attackers are capable of restoring\nservices to the botnets in a surprisingly\nrapid fashion. As more and more of our\nfinancial transactions occur online, criminals\nwill continue to target these transactions\nfor profit. Put simply, if there is money to\nbe made, there is money to be stolen. The\nindustry must focus on securing these\ntransactions to deprive attackers of the illicit\n\nincome they so desire.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Software analysis\n\nIn order to have a consistent view of the\ndata analyzed for this report, all identified\nissues were classified according to the HPE\nSoftware Security Taxonomy (originally the\n“Seven Pernicious Kingdoms”[293] ), which was\nsubstantially updated and refined[294 ]in\nmid-2014.\n\nDuring 2015, the taxonomy extended further\nto include other assessment techniques (such\nas manual analysis and mobile vulnerabilities)\nand HPE Security Fortify products such as\nHPE Security Fortify on Demand (FOD). This\nendeavor continues as the taxonomy evolves\nwith the most recent updates considered\nfor analysis in this report. Changes to the\ntaxonomy that affect statistics presented\nin this report are flagged as necessary\nthroughout the text. As a reminder of how\nthe taxonomy works, findings are sorted\ninto kingdoms, which consist of vulnerability\ncategories, each of which includes one or\nmore security issues.\n\n\n-----\n\n0 20% 40 60% 80 100%\n\n16%\nAPI Abuse\n30%\n\n17%\n\nCode Quality\n\n21%\n\n72%\n\nEncapsulation\n\n72%\n\n82%\n\nEnvironment\n\n77%\n\n47%\n\nErrors\n\n43%\n\nInput Validation 52%\nand Representation 44%\n\n86%\n\nSecurity Features\n\n90%\n\n22%\n\nTime and State\n\n20%\n\nFigure 36.

Year-to-year changes in the\nrankings for the three kingdoms with the\nlowest representation (API Abuse, Code\nQuality, and Time and State) are primarily\ndue to changes to the HPE Software\nSecurity Taxonomy itself. The most prevalent\nvulnerabilities remain the same for both\nyears. Likewise, the increase in API Abuse\nissues may be attributed to changes in the\ntaxonomy. In order to make a fair comparison,\ndisregarding the changes and comparing\nthe values based on the older classification,\nAPI Abuse vulnerabilities were actually\nreduced by half from 2014, to about 8% of\nvulnerabilities noted.\n\n\n**Why and how we do this analysis**\n\nOur yearly analysis of trends in application\nsecurity provides a unique snapshot of the\nstate of application security during the past\nyear. Readers are encouraged to use our\nfindings as a guide for issues to watch for\nduring their own development processes,\nto help plan their own effective security\ndevelopment lifecycle, and to structure and\ndeliver effective security training.\n\nBefore diving into the data, let’s define it. First,\nthe dataset is separated into two groups:\nmobile applications and those not geared\ntoward mobile (in this Risk Report, referred to\nsimply as “mobile” and “apps” or “web apps”).\nThe issues affecting the two types continued,\nin 2015, to differ significantly. Separating\nthe datasets provides a clearer picture of\nwhich vulnerabilities occur in each group.\nIt also accounts for significant differences\nin sample size, which are predicated on\nsignificant differences in dataset size. Each\nof the two main datasets is drawn from the\n\n\napplications processed by the HPE Security\nFortify on Demand service between October\n30, 2014, and October 30, 2015. This data\nwas anonymized and sanitized. The apps\ndataset, drawn from over 7000 scanned\napplications, includes both web and desktop\napps but, as previously noted, excludes\nmobile. The mobile dataset is drawn from\nover 450 scanned apps. Note that though\nboth datasets have expanded in size since\nlast year’s Risk Report, the rate of increase\nfor mobile is double that of apps—a 20%\nincrease as opposed to apps’ 9% bump.\n\n\n-----\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\n30%\nAPI Abuse\n79%\n\n21%\n\nCode Quality\n\n40%\n\n72%\n\nEncapsulation\n\n93%\n\n77%\n\nEnvironment\n\n88%\n\n43%\n\nErrors\n\n9%\n\nInput Validation 44%\nand Representation 82%\n\n\nWeb app containing\ntype of weakness\n\nMobile app containing\ntype of weakness\n\n\nSecurity Features\n\n20%\n\nTime and State\n\n23%\n\nFigure 37.

As with\nFigure 36, the chart shows the percentage of\napplications that exhibited a vulnerability in\nthe given kingdom at least once, but provides\nno information on what percentage of\napplications had more than one vulnerability\nthere. (This chart includes results from HPE\nSecurity Fortify on Demand’s Manual Mobile\nAnalysis tool.)\n\n\nSecurity Features continues to be the most\nrepresented kingdom for both traditional\nand mobile applications. Mobile applications\ntend to see over 10% more issues related to\nsecurity features than do other applications.\nThe vast majority of API Abuse issues in\n\nmobile are from three categories: Push\nNotifications, Ad/Analytics Frameworks,\nand General Pasteboard. As noted before,\nchanges to the taxonomy affected the API\nAbuse kingdom. Likewise, taxonomy changes\naffected mobile’s results in the Environment\n\nkingdom (showing a 14% apparent increase\nin vulnerabilities from before the changes)\nand in Time and State (showing a\n10% decrease).\n\n\n-----\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n\n6\n\n5\n\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n\n4\n\n3\n\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\n0%\n\nFigure 38.

Four of the\n\nkingdoms—Encapsulation, Security Features,\nEnvironment, and Errors—are represented\nin this chart.\n\n\nOnce again, a prominent result looks more\nremarkable than it is. The System Information\nLeak: External category, which didn’t make\nan appearance in last year’s analysis, would\nseem to be at the top of the heap in 2015.\nThe numbers aren’t actually as overwhelming\nas the bars would indicate—another artifact\nof changes to the taxonomy—but the\nvulnerability itself is well worth examining. It\ndescribes a situation in which too-detailed\n\n\nerror messages leak system data that might\n\nhelp attackers gain dangerous visibility into\nthe system. It’s not in itself a critical-severity\nvulnerability, but it can certainly assist in\nother attacks, including critical ones. It is\ntroubling to note in the analysis that half\nof the applications scanned exhibited a\nmedian of two System Information Leak:\nExternal issues per application. The Insecure\nTransport: HSTS Not Set category, second\n\nfrom the left in Figure 38, is a fairly new\ntaxonomy entry. The HTTP Shared Transport\nSecurity (HSTS) header was introduced to\nbattle man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks over\nSSL/TLS, such as protocol downgrade and\ncookiejacking. The good news is that most\nmodern browsers now support the HSTS\n\nheader. The bad news is that the analysis\nindicates many applications do not yet take\nadvantage of it.\n\n\n-----\n\n30%\n\n25%\n\n\n25%\n23%\n\n\n15\n\n10 10\n\n14% 14%\n12%\n11% 10% 10% 10%\n\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n\n10%\n\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\nMedian\nvulnerability\ncount\n\nPercentage\n\n\n3\n\n5%\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n0%\n\nFigure 39. The 10 most commonly occurring critical-class vulnerabilities in the applications dataset\n\n\n3\n\n\nOf course, mere prevalence isn’t what\nmakes a vulnerability vicious. Figure 39\npares down the dataset to show the 10\nmost frequently spotted critical-severity\nvulnerabilities in applications. Here, the most\nstrongly represented kingdoms are Security\n\nFeatures, Input Validation and Representation,\nEncapsulation, Code Quality, and API Abuse.\nEnvironment and Errors issues for the most\npart do not rise to the critical level.\n\nOver one-third of the applications\nscanned—35%—exhibited at least one criticalor high-severity vulnerability.\n\n\nits reach from SSLv3 (CVE-2014-3566) to\nTLSv1 (CVE-2014-8730).[295] Statistics for\n\nthese vulnerabilities are available for the\nfirst full year in 2015, and it’s disheartening\nto see them make such a strong showing.\nIt’s likely that many applications continue\nto use weak SSL protocols and ciphers for\n\nbackward-compatibility purposes, but it’s still\na dangerous choice.\n\nThe presence of Privacy Violations on the\n\nlist and the high occurrence median—10—\nare daunting in their own way. Elsewhere,\nthe critical-severity chart delivers a headslap moment with hardcoded passwords\nappearing in no less than 10% of applications.\nAs if that wasn’t bad enough, the median\nnumber of occurrences in affected\napplications was three. Five years after\nStuxnet made clear the profound security\nshortcomings of making a “password” part\nof the code itself, this particular vulnerability\nshould embarrass any software architect that\nallows it to happen.\n\n\n###### Over one-third of the applications scanned—\n 35%—exhibited at least\n one critical- or high-severity vulnerability.\n\n\nTwo categories, Insecure Transport: Weak\n\nSSL Protocol and Cross-Frame Scripting,\nappear in both the common and the\ncritical top 10. Indeed, most issues in those\ncategories are sufficiently dangerous to\nmerit the most severe classifications. The\nSSL finding is worth looking at more closely.\nAs longtime observers of the vulnerability\nscene know, SSL-related problems made\na very big splash in the last months of\n2014, with the POODLE exploit extending\n\n\n-----\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%\n\nInsecure Transport 67%\n\nWeb Server Misconfiguration 62%\n\nCookie Security 58%\n\nSystem Information Leak 52%\n\nPrivacy Violation 48%\n\nFigure 40. The five most frequently spotted categories across applications\n\n\nWith all of these insecure-transport issues\nturning up, we were interested to see that in\nmany cases cookies sent over SSL aren’t very\nsecure either. Nearly 38% of the applications\nwe saw with cookie-related issues failed to\nsend them over SSL—an excellent example\nof developer misuse of SSL/TLS. Meanwhile,\n\nHTTPOnly Not Set is strongly represented,\ncontributing to a third of cookie security\n\nissues. The HTTPOnly flag has been around\nfor quite some time, and yet it’s still missing\nin 41% of applications scanned.\n\nWith System Information Leak issues, it’s\ninteresting to note that over 97% of the\napplications that leak information do so to\nsome external entity. Also, based on the\noccurrences of the various issues, System\n\nInformation Leak: External contributes to\nmore than 80% of vulnerable instances.\n\n\n###### Top five vulnerability\n categories in applications\n\nBack to the apps dataset. Figure 40 shows\nthe five vulnerability categories most likely\nto appear in an application. They come to us\nfrom the Security Features, Environment, and\nEncapsulation kingdoms.\n\nLet’s discuss these five more closely to\ndetermine precisely what issues are turning\nup in each category. Insecure Transport,\nCookie Security, and Privacy Violation all fall\nunder the Security Features kingdom. While\nthese three categories refer to the cause of\na specific vulnerability in an application, the\nultimate effect of issues in these categories\nwould lead to some form of privacy violation.\n\nInsecure Transport: HSTS Not Set is the\nmost prevalent issue within this category,\naccounting for nearly 29% of findings. Again,\nthis may be due to the fact that HSTS is\na fairly new browser capability. We’ll be\nmonitoring this issue with interest in next\n\n\nyear’s Risk Report. Likewise, Weak SSL\nProtocol (20%) and Weak SSL Cipher (95%)\nboth may appear as a result of relatively new\nindustry standards and regulations (e.g., RC4\nbeing marked as unsafe,[296] the January 2015\nrelease of PCI SSC’s Data Security Standard\n3.1[297]), which result in more issues being\nflagged for existing configurations. Again,\nbackward compatibility decisions may be an\nissue here. Missing Perfect Forward Security\n(6%) is another relatively recent mitigation\ntechnique making a significant showing.[298]\n\nIn the Web Server Misconfiguration category,\ntwo issues—Unprotected Directories and\nUnprotected File—together composed just\nunder 64% of our findings. The Insecure\nContent-Type Setting header seems to\ncontribute to a lot of misconfiguration\nproblems, as well. Such issues are often an\nenabler for other problems, such as crosssite scripting. Our data indicates that around\n29%of applications in the sample set are\nvulnerable to misconfiguration issues such\nas these.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, let’s look at privacy violations. While\nautocomplete issues occur in well over a\nthird of the applications (38%), generic\nprivacy-violation issues corresponding to the\nexposure of user data seem to occur more\noften within the affected apps. In addition,\nmost autocorrect issues are of relatively low\nseverity, while other frequently seen privacyviolation issues are of critical or high severity\n(as we saw in Figure 39). We also noticed that\nwhile autocomplete issues occurred a median\nof twice per affected application, criticalseverity privacy issues occurred a median of\n10 times per affected application.\n\n\n###### Mobile vulnerabilities\n\nReturning to the mobile sphere to see what\nissues most plagued scanned apps there,\nsee Figure 41.\n\nFor mobile applications, it’s internal system\ninformation leaks that lead the most common\nlist. Their very large presence atop the list\nof most frequently encountered mobile\nvulnerabilities indicates that a substantial\nmajority of the applications we saw are\nstoring sensitive information on devices that\ncan be left on restaurant tables, stolen from\n\nbackpacks, and dropped in toilets. Note the\nhigh showing of Weak Encryption (69%), a\nflaw one sees far less often in\nnon-mobile applications.\n\n\nAs before, the issues that are common\nare not necessarily critical-level. Insecure\nTransport, eighth on the list of common\n\nflaws, leads the list of critical issues. A quick\nskim of the category names represented\nconfirms that developers are still struggling\nwith privacy issues on these devices. Overall,\nit should be noted that 75% of the mobile\napplications scanned have at least one\ncritical- or high-level finding, compared to\n35% of non-mobile applications.\n\n\n20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nSystem Information Leak: Internal 83%\n\nInsecure Storage: Lacking Data Protection 75%\n\nInsecure Deployment: Missing Jailbreak Detection 72%\n\nWeak Encryption 69%\n\nOften Misused: Push Notifications 65%\n\nPrivacy Violation: Geolocation 54%\n\nPrivacy Violation: Screen Caching 52%\n\nInsecure Transport 50%\n\nPrivacy Violation: iOS Property List 49%\n\nInsecure Transport: Missing Certificate Pinning 43%\n\nFigure 41.

Perhaps the problem is that\nmobile development is less mature than older\napplication types, and as such, developers\nmay not be following mature best practices\nfor mobile-specific APIs and frameworks (e.g.,\nPush Notifications, Ad/Analytics Frameworks,\nGeneral Pasteboard, Shared Keychain, and\nCalendar).\n\nRounding out the top five most frequently\nseen categories of mobile flaws, the\n\nEnvironmental category of Insecure\nDeployment takes the fifth spot, with 75% of\nmobile applications exhibiting weaknesses\nsuch as Missing Jailbreak Detection,\n\nMalicious Behavior, and OpenSSL issues. It\nis interesting to note that, had we expanded\nFigure 43 to show the 10 most frequently\nseen categories of vulnerabilities, positions\nsix through eight on that list are held by\ncategories related to Security Features (in\naddition to Privacy Violation)—specifically,\n\nWeak Encryption (70%), Insecure Transport\n(67%), and Privilege Management (49%).\n\n\n###### Top five vulnerability\n categories in mobile\n\nThe reason for that gap is clear—and it’s not\nonly a question of the size and portability\nof the device. Mobile applications have\na different runtime environment than do\ntraditional desktop and enterprise server\napplications. On mobile, the environment\nmakes heavy use of unique personally\n\nidentifiable information, such as geolocation\nand screen/keyboard caching. Moreover,\nthe environment often contains both\ntrusted and untrusted applications, creating\na unique situation in which the storage\nand transmission of private and sensitive\n\ninformation becomes a more pressing issue.\nAs such, it isn’t surprising that developers\nappear to be introducing an equally large\npercentage of Insecure Storage and Privacy\nViolation weaknesses into their mobile\napplications (88%). Compare this to the top\nfive vulnerabilities in the applications space\n(Figure 40), where Privacy Violations, though\nstill making the list, have a relatively weak\nshowing at 48%.\n\nWithin the Privacy Violations category for\nmobile, Geolocation, Screen Caching, iOS\nProperty List (iPhone only), and HTTP\n\n\nGET issues occur at very nearly the same\nfrequency and together account for 85%\nof all findings. Less frequently seen issues\n\ninclude problems related to credit cards,\npasswords, and autocomplete handling.\n\nIn the Insecure Storage category, 58%\nof issues spotted involve a lack of data\nprotection. Two issues, Android Backup\nStorage and Android World Readable or\nWriteable, are only found on that platform\nand together account for 28%\nof findings.\n\nIn the category of System Information Leak\nweaknesses, 86% of the mobile applications\nscanned had at least one detected issue,\nwhile 52% of traditional applications had\nsensitive system information leaks detected.\n\nWhile the majority of System Information\nLeak issues, 71%, were detected as local\nto the device, another 24 percent had the\npotential to leak sensitive information outside\nof the device.\n\nOften Misused comes in at the fourth spot\n(78%) for mobile apps as seen in Figure 43; in\nthe sphere of traditional apps, it shows up at\nan anemic 13th on the frequency list, with just\n23% of those applications having trouble of\nthis sort. It’s not entirely clear why this might\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Vulnerabilities in open\n source software\n\nJust as we examined trends in commercial\n\nsoftware as seen in the customer applications\nsubmitted to the Fortify on Demand service,\nwe examined similar trends in open source\nsoftware. We used HPE Security Fortify\nOpen Review (FOR) data on 287 applications\nspanning more than 10 programming\n\nlanguages. The dataset used for our analysis\ndid not include any mobile software.\n\nThe two most prevalent languages\n\nin the FOR dataset are PHP (50% of\nall applications) and Java (28% of all\napplications), which is reflective of the state\nof open source software today—with the\npossible exception of JavaScript, which is\ngaining in popularity and ubiquity. Because\nthe dataset for other languages is statistically\n\ninsignificant, our analysis focuses on PHP\nand Java applications.\n\n\nIt’s important to analyze open source\napplications separately from libraries and\nframeworks. The Fortify Open Review\nuses the HPE Security Fortify Static Code\nAnalyzer (SCA) to perform security analysis.\n\nWhen analyzing an application, the static\nanalyzer has a complete picture of all the\ndataflow traces and execution paths for that\napplication, and therefore can provide endto-end dataflow analysis results. Analyzing\n\nlibraries and frameworks separately from\napplications built on top of them is different,\n\nbecause libraries and frameworks only\nprovide some intermediate steps of the\napplication’s flow and therefore will not\ngenerate the same full execution paths\nand data flows as those of an end-to-end\napplication. Figure 45 demonstrates the\n\nbreakdown of Java and PHP applications\nby type. For the purposes of our analysis,\nlibraries and frameworks are treated\nthe same.\n\n\n**Number of**\n**Language**\n**applications**\n\n\n**Type** **PHP** **Java**\n\n\nPHP 143\n\nJava 80\n\nPython 19\n\n.NET 14\n\nCFML 13\n\nRuby 5\n\nOther 5\n\nMBS (Fortify SCA\n4\nintermediate language)\n\nSQL 2\n\nC/C++ 1\n\nXML 1\n\n**Total** **287**\n\nFigure 44.

HPE Security Fortify taxonomy kingdom distribution across all Java applications in the FOR\ndataset\n\n\nexperience, there are a lot more libraries for\ndoing input validation for Java than there are\nfor PHP, which we believe explains why the\npercentage across Java applications is lower\nthan that across PHP applications. Security\nFeatures takes second place for both Java\n(82%) and PHP (87%) applications. Both types\nof applications contain a number of password\nmanagement and privacy violation issues that\nbelong to the Security Features kingdom.\nTheir presence implies that these applications\ndo not take good care of private data. Fortify\nStatic Code Analyzer does not detect Time\nand State and Errors issues in PHP out of\nthe box, which is why the percentage of\nPHP applications that contain these kinds of\nfindings is zero percent for both kingdoms. On\nthe contrary, 64% of Java applications contain\nissues related to Time and State. Specifically,\na number of Java applications incorrectly use\ndouble-checked locking patterns.\n\n\n###### Distribution by kingdom: applications\n\nLet’s start by looking at the distribution of\ntaxonomy kingdoms across applications in\nour dataset.\n\nFigure 46 shows the percentage by kingdom\nof open source Java applications that have\nat least one vulnerability, and presents the\ndistribution across all of the Java applications\n\nin the FOR dataset. Figure 47 illustrates the\nsame data, but for PHP applications.\n\n\nIt is interesting to observe that in the case of\nJava, Code Quality is an obvious “winner,” with\n97% of applications vulnerable to issues from\nthis kingdom. We have seen quite a few Code\nQuality findings in Java applications, including\nunreleased resources such as sockets and\ndatabases, and dereferences of null values.\nOn the other hand, the HPE Security Fortify\nStatic Code Analyzer (SCA) does not detect\ncode quality issues in PHP out of the box,\nwhich explains why no PHP applications\ncontain any issues from the Code Quality\nkingdom.\n\nInstead, the most active kingdom for PHP\nis Input Validation and Representation\n(97%). This makes a lot of sense when one\nconsiders notoriously numerous cross-site\nscripting findings and CVEs in open source\nPHP applications. Input Validation and\nRepresentation takes third place across\nJava applications, with 76% of applications\nvulnerable to issues in this kingdom. In our\n\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nAPI Abuse        28%\n\nCode Quality 0%\n\nEncapsulation 45%\n\nEnvironment 4%\n\nErrors 0%\n\n\nInput Validation and Representation\n\nSecurity Features\n\nTime and State\n\n\n97%\n\n\nFigure 47. HPE Security Fortify taxonomy kingdom distribution across all PHP applications in the FOR dataset\n\n\n-----\n\nComparing the trends in open source\nsoftware to those in commercial software,\nthere are a number of interesting\nobservations. First of all, the Security Features\nkingdom is prominent, with over 80% of both\nopen source and commercial applications\nvulnerable to issues in this kingdom. This\nimplies that both types of applications have\ntrouble managing private data. The reason a\nmuch higher percentage (77%) of commercial\napplications are vulnerable to issues in the\nEnvironment kingdom, as opposed to open\nsource Java (36%) and PHP (4%) applications,\nis because in addition to static analysis,\ncommercial applications also underwent\ndynamic analysis, which is much more suitable\nfor detecting issues in the environment rather\nthan in actual application source code. A\nlot fewer commercial applications (44%, as\nopposed to 76% of open source Java and 97%\nof open source PHP) are vulnerable to issues\nin the Input Validation and Representation\nkingdom. This kingdom contains\nvulnerabilities that have been in existence for\na long time and have been tackled by security\nteams in our customers’ organizations for a\nwhile, through either thorough code reviews\nor enforcement of the usage of open source\nand proprietary validation libraries. Similarly,\n\n\na lot fewer commercial applications (21%)\nare susceptible to Code Quality issues than\nare open source Java applications (97%).\nThis seems to indicate that developers of\ncommercial applications do a much better job\nof releasing resources and doing null checks\nbefore dereferencing a value. This could be\ndue to their access to better tools for finding\nmemory management issues during the\ntesting cycle.\n\nThe only other outlier seems to be the\nEncapsulation kingdom, where more\ncommercial applications (over 70%) but only\n39% of open source Java and 45% of open\nsource PHP applications contain issues in this\nkingdom. Most of the reported issues have to\ndo with leaking system information outside\nof the application. Because commercial\napplications were analyzed both statically and\ndynamically, and system information leaks\ncan be found both statically and dynamically,\nmore commercial applications exhibited\nissues in the Encapsulation kingdom during\nour scans, as compared to open source\napplications.\n\n\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n\nAPI Abuse 30%\n\nCode Quality 21%\n\nEncapsulation 72%\n\nEnvironment 77%\n\nErrors 43%\n\nInput Validation and Representation 44%\n\nSecurity Features 90%\n\nTime and State 20%\n\nFigure 48.

HPE Security Fortify taxonomy kingdom distribution across all Java and PHP libraries and frameworks in the FOR dataset\n\n\n###### Distribution by kingdom: libraries\n\nNow let’s take a look at the same trends in\nopen source libraries and frameworks.\n\nFigure 49 displays kingdom distribution\nacross all Java and PHP libraries and\nframeworks in the FOR dataset. The results\nlook pretty similar to those observed for\nopen source applications. The Code Quality\nkingdom is the most prolific for Java libraries\nand frameworks, with almost identical\nincidence percentages (97% for applications\nand 98% for libraries). If the 1% difference\nhas any significance, it may be that libraries\nare exposing APIs for opening and closing\nresources, which would mean that managing\nthem is left to the application. The number\nof libraries that contain Input Validation and\nRepresentation vulnerabilities, while still\nhigh (70% for Java and 88% for PHP), is a\nlittle lower than the number of applications\n(76% for Java and 97% for PHP) because, as\nexplained earlier, libraries and frameworks\nrepresent only a step in a flow of data through\nthe application built on top of these libraries\nand frameworks.\n\n\nThe same is true for Security Features. The\nnumber of libraries that contain issues in this\nkingdom (70% for Java and 80% for PHP) is\nslightly lower than the number of affected\napplications (82% for Java and 87% for PHP)\nbecause two major categories from this\nkingdom represented in the dataset—Privacy\nViolation and Password Management—\nusually involve flow of data, which cannot\nbe provided end to end in a library as\nopposed to the application built using it.\nSimilar conclusions can be made about the\nEncapsulation kingdom represented by\nSystem Information Leak issues—another\ndataflow category. As for Environment, more\nJava applications (36%) than libraries (17%)\ncontain issues in this kingdom because it’s\nusually the application that needs to be\nconfigured to use a particular framework, not\nthe framework itself. The situation is different\nfor PHP: The number of applications (4%) that\ncontain issues in this kingdom is about the\nsame as the number of libraries (6%) because\nfewer misconfiguration patterns specific to\ncertain PHP frameworks are supported by the\nFortify SCA out of the box.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Open source vulnerabilities\n\nNext, let’s look at the top 10 vulnerability categories across applications and libraries.\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\n\nUnreleased Resource\n\nNull Dereference\n\nPrivacy Violation\n\nCross-Site Scripting\n\nPassword Management\n\nCode Correctness\n\nXML External Entity Injection\n\nXML Entity Expansion Injection\n\nHeader Manipulation\n\nSystem Information Leak\n\n\n40%\n\n38%\n\n\nFigure 50.

Top 10 vulnerability categories for Java libraries and frameworks in the FOR dataset\n\n\n-----\n\nThe results look very much like those\nobserved in the distribution-by-kingdom\ndata. For example, Code Quality categories\nUnreleased Resource and Null Dereference\nare the corresponding number one and\ntwo for both Java applications (Figure 50)\nand frameworks (Figure 52), which meshes\nwith the Code Quality kingdom being the\ntop kingdom across both Java applications\n(Figure 46) and libraries (Figure 49).\nFurthermore, as is the case with distribution\nby kingdom, the percentage of Java libraries\nthat contain Unreleased Resource and Null\nDereference issues is slightly higher than\nthose of Java applications, because libraries\ncould provide an API for opening and closing\nresources, leaving it up to the application\nto securely use these APIs. Similarly,\nthe leading category for both PHP\napplications (Figure 51) and libraries\n(Figure 53) is Cross-Site Scripting, which is\none of the most widespread vulnerability\ncategories of the Input Validation and\nRepresentation kingdom—the numberone kingdom across both PHP applications\n(Figure 47) and libraries (Figure 49).\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that the XML External\nEntity Injection vulnerability category appears\nin third place for Java libraries (Figure 52)\nand seventh place for Java applications\n(Figure 50). We observed similar trends in\nour analysis of open source Java software\ndependencies. According to that analysis,\nXML External Entity Injection tops the list\nof vulnerability categories for open source\nJava software dependencies. In general, XML\nExternal Entity Injection and XML Entity\nExpansion Injection vulnerabilities both\nmade the top 10 list for Java applications\nand libraries. This shows how much Java\napplications and libraries rely on XML and\nhow much they don’t handle it securely.\nPHP applications and libraries, on the other\nhand, still struggle with more traditional\nvulnerability types, such as Path Manipulation,\nHeader Manipulation, Open Redirect,\nand Cookie Security.\n\n\nCross-Site Scripting\n\nPossible Variable Overwrite\n\nPrivacy Violation\n\nPassword Management\n\nPath Manipulation\n\nHeader Manipulation\n\nCookie Security\n\nOpen Redirect\n\nDangerous File Inclusion\n\nDynamic Code Evaluation\n\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\n29%\n\n24%\n\n20%\n\n19%\n\n19%\n\n18%\n\n17%\n\n17%\n\n13%\n\n11%\n\n\nFigure 53.

After all, an attacker looks\nfor a hole to allow entry in the organization,\nand doesn’t care how it got there (unless\nit can lead to other useful points of entry\nto the targeted system). Last year’s Risk\nReport presented analysis of third-party Java\nlibraries and the known vulnerabilities that\nthose libraries introduced in the applications\nscanned. This section updates that research,\nin addition to a few fresh views and insights.\n\nThe sample used for this analysis consists\nof 212 CVEs that were reported across 129\ndifferent libraries, if all versions of the same\nlibrary are counted as a single library. (If each\nversion was to be counted as a separate\nlibrary, the total is 330.) The usage data was\ncollected from 232 enterprise applications.\n\n\n**Reliance on open source components**\n\nLast year, 65% of the applications scanned\nused at least one open source component.\nThis year that has risen to 79%, substantially\ndue to the apps newly added this year.\n\nFurthermore, 44% of the applications are\nmore than 50% composed of open source\ncomponents, down from 55% of applications\nscanned last year.\n\nTo further understand the factors\ncontributing to the significant increase in\nopen source component adoption, we looked\nat open source component usage in the 103\napplications that are new in this year’s dataset.\nThe distribution of usage is shown in\nFigure 55.\n\nThe Y axis in Figure 55 indicates one\nprobable reason for the increase in open\nsource presence in our dataset—all 103 new\napplications have at least one open source\ncomponent. This is another indication that\nopen source components are becoming an\nintegral part of software development.\nTheir weaknesses must thus be taken into\naccount in overall risk analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nInput Validation and Representation issues\nrepresent the most reported kingdom in\nFigure 56. The Code Quality kingdom is\nnot heavily represented here, likely because\nissues in that kingdom tend not to\ngarner CVEs.\n\nConsider a different view of the data, one\nin which we look at the ranking of the\nkingdoms when their occurrences across all\napplications are tallied. This would provide\nthe likelihood of an issue in a kingdom\noccurring in an application. While Input\nValidation and Representation and Security\nFeatures remain the top kingdoms affecting\nthe applications, in Figure 57 Errors rises up\nto third place from last in number of CVEs.\nThis shows that just a few issues in the Errors\nkingdom issues seem to affect 17% of all\napplications in the sample.\n\nComparing this chart with Figure 48,\nit’s interesting to note that while 77%\nof applications organically introduced\nEnvironment issues, less than 2% of\napplications inherited these issues from\nexternal libraries. This is probably because\nmost third-party references aren’t standalone\napplications, but rather libraries configured\nfrom the app itself. Almost 72% of proprietary\napplications had boundary issues (Kingdom:\nEncapsulation); meanwhile, 7% of applications\nhave Encapsulation issues because of thirdparty libraries. For all applications with at\nleast one Security Feature flaw, it is twice as\nlikely that a flaw was introduced organically\n(that is, by the developers themselves) than\nthat it got into the code by way of a thirdparty library. Considering that this is the\ntop kingdom of vulnerabilities introduced in\nproprietary and mobile (Figure 37) as well\nas open source applications (Figure 48),\nvulnerabilities introduced due to improper\nusage (or non-usage) of Security Features\nseem to plague all types of applications.\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%\n\nAPI Abuse 1%\n\nCode Quality 0%\n\nEncapsulation 2%\n\nEnvironment 1%\n\nErrors 1%\n\nInput Validation and Representation 68%\n\nSecurity Features 23%\n\nTime and State 3%\n\nFigure 56.

When the count is not restricted to issues with CVEs, issues in the Errors\nkingdom move up the charts.\n\n\n-----\n\nXML External Entity Injection has become\nthe top concern this year, switching places\nwith Denial of Service. The vulnerability is\npervasive, affecting over 20% of all referenced\nlibraries, which in turn were referenced by\n33% of the applications in our dataset. When\ncompared with Figure 59, the top issue not\nrelated to Code Quality is in fact XML External\nEntity Injection (XXE). As mentioned before,\n\n\ncode quality issues don’t generally get CVEs.\nThat leaves XXE as the most prevalent and\ndisclosed vulnerability in these dependencies\nduring the survey period. This year, fewer\nencryption-related issues were observed\ncompared to last year, when Insecure SSL was\naccompanied with weak\ncryptographic signatures.\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n\n\nXML External Entity Injection\n\nDenial of Service\n\nCross-site Scripting: Reflected\n\nDirectory Traversal\n\nAccess Control: Authorization Bypass\n\nOGNL Expression Injection: Struts 2\n\nInsecure SSL: Server Identity Verification Disabled\n\nHeader Manipulation\n\nDynamic Code Evaluation: Code Injection\n\nAccess Control: Missing Authorization Check\n\nFigure 58.

The severity of instances in the top 10 CVEs\n\nIt is important to note that although the XXE\nissue is an Input Validation weakness and\nnormally considered a critical bug, not all\ninstances of reported issues are critical. For\nthe purposes of this analysis, the severity\nscale is based on CVSS base score and is\nnormalized into three levels (Critical, Severe,\nand Moderate). Most XXE issues are severe,\nbut only four are critical-class. In contrast,\nseven out of 11 OGNL Expression Injection\ninstances are considered critical, making\nit one of the most concerning issues this\nyear. Figure 61 shows the 10 libraries most\nfrequently seen in our sample dataset.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor a glimpse of the complex and fluid\nrelationship between the number of versions\nreleased of any particular library and the\nnumber of CVEs known for it, take a look at\nadoption and result patterns for the library\nmost commonly encountered in our\nscans—commons-fileupload–as shown in\nFigure 62.\n\nThere are seven versions of this library in\nthe dataset, with 1.3 being the latest version.\nThirty percent of all applications that\nreferenced open source components in the\nsample referenced some version of the library.\nHowever, only four referenced the latest 1.3\nversion; of those four, only one had upgraded\nto the latest from an older version.\n\nGenerally speaking, about 9% of all scanned\napplications that use at least one open\nsource component in the sample upgraded\nat least one of their libraries. Within this data\nsubset, only around 5 percent of applications\nupgraded to the latest version of the library.\n\nOverall, 49% of applications referencing open\nsource components used the latest version of\nsome library.\n\nLastly, we looked again at the five most\nvulnerable applications scanned in 2015 in\norder to compare the vulnerabilities found\nin each application’s native code to the\nvulnerabilities each inherited from\nexternal dependencies.\n\n\n1\n\n1.0-beta-1\n\n1.1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.2.1\n\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\ncommons-fileupload 41%\n\ncommons-httpclient 33%\n\naxis 32%\n\nhttpclient 28%\n\nspring-web 27%\n\nstruts 26%\n\nspring-core 26%\n\nxalan 26%\n\nxercesImpl 26%\n\nspring-webmvc 21%\n\nFigure 61.

For this analysis, we looked\nat vulnerabilities that were both found for the\nfirst time and fixed within the same yearlong\nperiod (October 30, 2014, to October 30,\n2015). All vulnerabilities represented in the\ndata were triaged and closed. The closed\nissues may or may not have been remediated.\nThis question is considered in the analysis\nbelow.\n\n\nOnly 48% of the mobile issues in our sample\nseem to have been remediated—a stark\ndifference from the 92% we saw on the\napplications side. There are a couple of\nanomalous moments in Figure 66, as one\nmight expect from a very small dataset. For\ninstance, the poor showing in Environment\nis actually down to one specific Android app\nwith multiple issues in that kingdom. The\ndevelopers of that app did not successfully\nremediate, and the bar chart pays the price\n(as do, presumably, the users). In this dataset,\n86% of all vulnerabilities fall into the Security\nFeatures, Code Quality, or Environment\nkingdoms. In the Security Features kingdom,\n57% of all issues are in the Privacy Violation\ncategory, out of which around 53% were\nremediated. In turn, within Privacy Violation,\nmore than 65% of the findings were Screen\nCaching issues, and 54% of those were\nremediated. Alas, almost all of the issues not\nremediated were critical- or high-severity\nissues.\n\nCritical\n\n\n**Number of vulnerabilities fixed**\n\nWe begin with the applications dataset.\nFigure 66 shows the percentage of\nvulnerabilities fixed across all kingdoms,\ncolor-coded by severity.\n\n\nOverall, more than 92% of all issues closed\nwere remediated. This is good; most of the\nissues that are triaged are seen through to\nremediation. The remediation rate in Errors is\nparticularly fine, perhaps because\n\n100%\n\n\nproblems in that kingdom are generally\neasier to fix. In contrast, the API Abuse\nkingdom appears to be lagging. Further data\nanalysis indicates that the anomaly can be\nascribed to a very few applications—less\nthan 2% of those in the dataset—that did\nnot successfully remediate three specific\ntypes of weakness: Mass Assignment, ASP\n.NET MVC Bad Practices, and File Disclosure.\nShifting to mobile applications in Figure 66,\nit’s important to note our mobile remediation\nsample size was extremely limited, especially\ncompared to that available in the applications\nsphere. Though the sample is more or less\nevenly balanced between Android and iOS\napplications, the total number of samples\nin mobile (45) is such that our researchers\nregard the data here as interesting,\nbut possibly non-representative of the\nwider world.\n\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n\nHigh\n\nMedium\n\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n\nLow\n\nTotal\n\n\n0%\n\n100%\n\n\nPer kingdom\n\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n\nFigure 65.

Typically, the process unfolds\nlike so:\n\n\n**Scan results**\n\nIn order to analyze remediation patterns\namong static scans, we compiled a sample\ndataset of 327 applications.\n\n\ncross-site scripting issues we saw were fixed\nin this range. Of those, the vast majority were\nin the Cross-Site Scripting: Reflected category,\nthough a few Persistent and DOM issues\nturned up as well. This pattern makes sense\ndue to the general pervasiveness of\nReflected XSS compared to other examples\nof the problem.\n\nFurther down the chart, the random spikes\nafter the fourth range of scans are caused by\nunusual activities in a very few applications.\nThese are anomalous artifacts of the small\ndataset and do not represent the pattern\nexhibited by a majority of the applications.\n\n\nThe scanning patterns of users for static and\ndynamic scans vary. Static scans are usually\nmore frequent, with a median of six days\nbetween scans. There tends to be a longer\ninterval—27 days—between dynamic scans.\nDue to this variation, the following analysis is\nperformed separately for static and dynamic\nscans within our sample set.\n\n80%\n\n70%\n\n60%\n\n50%\n\n40%\n\n30%\n\n20%\n\n10%\n\n\nMost low-severity vulnerabilities found in\nstatic scans seem to be fixed very early on.\nIn this dataset, these numbers reflect System\nInformation Leak issues, most of which were\nrelatively straightforward and fixed very\nquickly. Most critical-severity issues are\naddressed in the second range of scans (6\nto 11 scans, or 31 to 60 days). This may be\nbecause critical vulnerabilities tend to require\nlonger investigations, and the fixes take\nlonger to engineer as well.

Remediation patterns in static and dynamic scans for mobile applications\n\n\nTotal\n\nStatic\n\n\nDynamic\n\n\nWe used scan data on 301 applications\nto analyze remediation patterns among\ndynamic scans. In Figure 69, each range\nroughly corresponds to the time between\ntwo dynamic scans. A lot of vulnerabilities\nof every severity are addressed early on. Of\nparticular note, most critical-class Cross-Site\nScripting findings were remediated within\nthe first range of dynamic scans. In contrast,\nthe critical XSS findings caught by static\nscans weren’t remediated until the second\nscan range (Figure 68). The difference may\nlie in the kinds of information presented to\ndevelopers by the two scan technologies.\n\nTurning our attention to scanning patterns\nfor mobile, we noted that the median time\n\n\nbetween scans was much closer—17 days\nbetween static scans, 21 days between\ndynamic scans. Once more, this may be an\nartifact of the small dataset, or something\nelse may be a factor here. It makes sense to\npresent these numbers in a single chart.\n\nAlthough the sample dataset is much smaller\nthan that available to examine remediation of\napplication vulnerabilities, it is still interesting\nto note that overall trends of dynamic and\nstatic scans over 30-day ranges are very\nsimilar to those observed with the application\nscans.\n\nWith all this analysis, we’re now in a position\nto make some cumulative observations about\nour remediation data.\n\n\n-----\n\n120%\n\n80%\n\n\n40%\n\nFigure 71.

Cumulative remediation of remediated applications\n\n\nStatic\n\n\nOverall, about 90% of all issues discovered\nin static scans seem to be resolved within\nthe first four ranges. Within those first four\nranges, we saw spikes for each severity of\nvulnerability. This shows that vulnerabilities\nof all severities are addressed within this time,\nand that outliers to those ranges are not\ndetermined by severity class.\n\n\nLooking at the speed with which application\ndevelopers remediated their triaged issues,\nthere is notable parity between scan\ntechnologies. For static scans, 35% of all\napplications remediated issues that were\nspotted within the first scan range (that is,\nwithin six static scans; the day of the first\nscan in which the vulnerability appears is\nnumbered as day zero). By the end of the\nfourth range (21 scans, or 90-120 days), that\npercentage was up to 76%. For dynamic scans,\n32% of issues were remediated within the first\nrange By the end of the fourth range the\n\n\nDynamic\n\npercentage was up to 79%. Though there’s\ncertainly a functional difference between the\nstatic and dynamic scan technologies, both\nare clearly being used for their intended\npurpose of making apps better.\n\n\nFinally, let’s see how mobile time to fix shapes\nup, keeping in mind once again the oddities a\nsmall dataset brings.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this sphere, vulnerabilities reported from\ndynamic scans seem to be remediated a bit\nfaster than those from static scans, though\nagain the difference in static and dynamic\nscan intervals on the mobile side is not as\ngreat as the gap on the applications side.\n\n120%\n\n\n80%\n\n\n40%\n\nFigure 73.

Both applications\nand mobile software pose unique challenges\nto developers, and various vulnerabilities\ndetected in these platforms support that\nimpression. It was also interesting to note that\napplications and mobile shared certain trends\nin vulnerabilities when analyzed by kingdom,\nthus pointing to common fundamental failures\nin the software. The rate of vulnerability\nremediation seems to be increasing, which\nsuggests that technologies are becoming\nbetter understood as they mature.\nNevertheless, there is room for improvement\nas shown by the prevalent issues detected.\n\n\nOn the mobile front, the race to compete in a\nnew, powerful market has forced vulnerable\ndeployments with known issues. Moreover,\nall types of applications tend to use thirdparty libraries to ease and speed up the\ndevelopment process. But such actions can\nlead to inheritance of additional vulnerabilities\nfrom yet another source. Here, two main items\nneed to be noted. While most high-impact\nissues in third-party libraries are disclosed\nas CVEs, it is disturbing to note that the\napplications that use them are not updated\nsoon enough. Also, CVEs do not represent all\nthe issues found in third-party software and,\nas shown by data from the FOR project,\n\n\nother undisclosed issues may still exist.\nBased on these discoveries, more awareness\nand training could be offered to improve\nthe quality of applications being developed.\nThe goal of secure software development\nis not only to remediate all vulnerabilities,\nbut to develop applications that don’t have\nvulnerabilities in the first place. While we\nmove toward this ideal world, the right kinds\nof investment could take us closer to the goal.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Defense and defenders\n\n**The security state of defenders**\n\nAs organizations struggle to address security\ngaps and to operate in an assume-the-breach\nworld, defenders grapple with the need for\nimproved detections. Currently, the most\ncommon method of event detection involves\nmonitoring correlated log data, but there’s\na whole world of options for defenders to\nnavigate. For this year’s Risk Report, we polled\ndefenders and derived a clearer picture of the\ndefender landscape.\n\nAll organizations need the ability to respond\nto threats. In research we conducted[299] among\na self-selecting group of incident responders\nand enterprises, 80% of respondents report\nhaving security operations functions within\ntheir organization as seen in Figure 74.\n\n\n-----\n\nFifty-one percent report the presence of a\nformal security operations center (SOC),\nand almost 11% reported themselves to be in\nthe process of building one, as seen in Figure\n75. These numbers do not take into account\nsmall or midsized businesses[300] in which\nthe expectation would be a much smaller\npercentage of formal SOCs.\n\nThe fundamental purpose of a security\noperations center is monitoring.\nAdditionally, according to Ponemon’s 2015\nCost of Cyber Crime Report, detection\nand recovery make up 53% of internal activity\ncost (incident/non-budget costs), followed\nclosely by containment and investigation—all\nprocesses that are often managed by\nsecurity operations.[301]\n\n\n###### 2.7%\n\n 6.8%\n\n 10.8%\n\nYes\n\n###### 79.7% No\n\nIn the process of building\nOther (please specify)\n\nFigure 74.

For decades,\noperational logs have been collected to\nfacilitate troubleshooting. However, in an\neffort to maintain availability, the collection\nprocess has relied on the centralization\nof IT. The largest gap in security log\ncollection occurs in areas where operational\nlog collection has not been a priority. In\nmany organizations, server log collection\nis limited to events dictated by various\ncompliance requirements, or is stymied\nby a lack of centralized management and\nconcurrence in event collection. Likewise,\nclient host event collection is virtually nonexistent, with ROI decisions focused on the\ncost to re-image machines versus event\ncollection infrastructure, storage, and even\ntroubleshooting investigation costs. Antivirus\ndata is one of the primary client and server\nhost findings most organizations collect and\nfeed into their SIEM, although log collection\nand monitoring infrastructure scale concerns\ngrow as the company does.\n\n\nSecurity analysis content. For security\noperations to have a chance of analysis and\ndetection of intrusion, SIEM content must\nexist that allows reasonable notification of\nsecurity relevant concerns. The creation\nand honing of content is more than a data\nproblem; it’s simple math. Let’s assume an\norganization has 20 different device types\nto monitor (firewall, server, proxy, antivirus,\napplications, and so on), and each of the\ndevice types has the potential to generate\n200 different events. This means we have\na data field of 4000 potential event IDs\nto review. Some events will be strictly\noperational, some will be security, and some\ncould apply to both, so conservatively we\nreduce the interesting event types to 75\nper device, yielding an analysis field of 1500\ninteresting items. Now take this base of 1500\ninteresting events and multiply it by 500\nindividual devices—and don’t forget that this\ndata expands exponentially when factors such\nas device OS versions and time are included\nin calculations.\n\n\nThese equations become important when\nconsidering security information detection\nand correlation. Some may believe reactive\nsecurity operations to be at a disadvantage,\nas they must spot the initial intrusion to\neffectively protect an organization. In reality,\nhowever, this is inaccurate; there are multiple\npoints at which defenders can detect, and\ncontain, an issue. Monitoring may catch an\nevent at any point in the attack chain, at any\ndevice event, at any time there is malicious\nactivity. The data to be considered expands\nconsiderably, but so does the ability to detect.\nThere is not one single event in an active\nintrusion, but the potential to catch any\nactivity that occurs.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Analysis of breaches over the last couple of\n years shows a major trend of attacks that\n focus on applications and their assets.\n\n\n###### OpSec:\n detection in the real world\n\nThe 2014 Ponemon report noted that “certain\norganizational factors reduced the overall\ncost [of a breach]. If the organization has a\nstrong security posture or a formal incident\nresponse plan in place before the incident, the\naverage cost of a data breach was reduced\nby as much as (respectively) $21 and $17 per\nrecord. Finally, appointing a CISO to lead the\ndata breach incident response team reduced\nper capita cost by $10.”[303] While there’s not\na direct correlation between employing a\nCISO and reducing breach costs, one need\nlook no further than the 2014 quarterly\nprofit expectations at Target, an organization\nwithout a CISO at the time of its breach.[304]\n\nLet’s look at how detection played a role in\nthe January 2015 Anthem data breach, which\nwe mentioned in the privacy section. When\nAnthem reported the incident,[305] it had been\nunderway for seven weeks—well below the\naverage breach duration of 200+ days for the\n\n303  http://www.hp.com/go/ponemon.\n\n304 http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/21/investing/target-earnings/index.\nhtml.\n\n305 https://www.anthemfacts.com/.\n\n306 http://www.hp.com/go/ponemon.\n\n307 htt // i / i l i k\n\n\ndataset cited in Ponemon.[306] (Other studies\nsuggest other durations.[307]) The company\nfigured out it had been breached when a\nsharp-eyed database administrator noticed\nunusual activity—specifically, a database\nquery made with his ID code.[308] This all\nsounds very positive, but Anthem probably\ndidn’t feel that way, as it was one of the\nlargest known corporate breaches of personal\ninformation to date (at that time).[309] It was also\nAnthem’s second time at the breach rodeo.\nIt was compromised as well in 2010 under a\nprevious name, WellPoint.[310]\n\nThe Anthem breach is just one of many\nindications that attackers have shifted their\nefforts to directly attack applications.

The success of these\nattacks in spite of perimeter, network, and\ntraditional application defenses indicates that\ndefenders must adapt their strategies.\n\n312 https://www4.symantec.com/mktginfo/whitepaper/ISTR/21347931_\nGA-internet-security-threat-report-volume-20-2015-appendices.pdf.\n\n313 http://f6ce14d4647f05e937f4-4d6abce208e5e17c2085b466b9\n8c2083.r3.cf1.rackcdn.com/work-smarter-harder-to-secure-yourapplications-pdf-9-w-1884.pdf.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur research found a relatively low degree\nof comfort with application monitoring.\nThe trend of using applications directly for\nthreat intelligence is new, and many of the\norganizations surveyed did not know exactly\nwhat applications to monitor or how they\nshould monitor their applications, or what\nsecurity threats could be derived from this\ndata. This low visibility, combined with the\nfact that application-related breaches are not\ndecreasing despite the use of more traditional\nsecurity methods, shows that this area of\nsecurity intelligence is still immature. Most\norganizations are not yet getting the results\nthey need and are not keeping pace with\nattacker trends. But defenders must adapt to\nsurvive. They must learn to treat applications\nas security devices. An application should\nhave defensive capabilities, and it should\nprovide security-related events such as\nauthentication, authorization, configuration,\nand resource access to security analysts.\n\n318 https://www.qualys.com/docs/guide_vulnerability_management.pdf.\n\n319 http://cyberattackdefenders.com/blog/security-operations-centersoc automation why it matters/\n\n\n###### Direct defense\n and automation\n\nOrganizations are becoming more aware of\nthe need for direct application monitoring\nand defense. In our recent survey[314] of\norganizations, 28% said they monitored their\ninternal applications for security-related\nevents, and 43% reported monitoring their\nexternal-facing applications. This is a dramatic\nincrease from just a few years ago, when\nalmost no one was monitoring applications\nfor security-related events. Industry analysts\nhave also recognized[315] new product market\ncategories for direct application monitoring\nand defense, with most products allowing for\ncentralized monitoring and analysis.\n\nWhether related to a direct application attack\nor simply a vulnerability, studies have shown\na security flaw will most likely be exploited\nwithin 60 days of discovery, but companies\nmay take over 100 days to remediate it.[316] This\nposes the question, “Can humans react fast\nenough to network security attacks?” Most\nof information security history points to the\nanswer being “No.” This is borne out by the\ngreat number of successful attacks that were\ndetected, some even at the early stage of the\nattack, but that companies nonetheless failed\nto stop in time.\n\nMany companies are relying on installing\n\n314  www.surveymonkey.com/r/ProtectSOC\n\n315  https://www.gartner.com/doc/3090717/hype-cycle-applicationsecurity\n\n\nmore detection systems, many of which are\nplaced in passive mode, meaning they will\nnot interrupt traffic when a threat is detected.\nThis is primarily because one device is not\nenough to differentiate between an actual\nattack and a false positive.\n\nOne of the manual methods used to mitigate\na confirmed attack is to configure a firewall\nto stop the traffic. The problem is that these\nconfigurations take time to implement, and\nthe attack may have already succeeded in\nremoving data or compromising systems.\nUndetectable malware may have been\ndeposited to wait and send data out to one or\nmore Internet hosts. Knowing your network,\naddressing, and current real-time network\nconfigurations along with point-of-contact\nadmins along each node helps to cut down on\nresponse time.\n\nThe industry generally agrees that the fastest\nremediation is automated remediation.[317, 318]\nFor example, defenders might use a security\nenterprise manager to correlate events from\ndifferent devices, first confirming an actual\nattack is occurring, then sending commands\nto routers or firewalls to block the traffic.[319]\nThis may cause some inconvenience to\ncompany users, but the alternative, as\nAnthem and so many others can attest,\nis much worse.\n\n316 http://www.complysmart.com/component/easyblog/entry/studyclaims-enterprise-vulnerability-remediation-can-take-120-days.\nhtml?Itemid=52.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conclusion\n\nIn research we conducted among a selfselecting group of incident responders\nand enterprises, four-fifths of respondents\nreport having security operations functions\nwithin their organization. This low number\ngives us pause, because it is clear from our\nresearch that many organizations are not\nkeeping pace with attacker trends, including\ndirect attacks of the systems on which\nenterprises rely. We found evidence that\nadversaries are taking excellent advantage\nof technologies enterprises have put in place\nto serve their customers. Only by learning to\ntreat applications as security entities on the\nnetwork can defenders hope to adapt to the\nnew adversary landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Trends in security: the conference scene\n\nDespite the wealth of research resources\navailable to us in-house, the HPE Security\nResearch team still remembers there’s a world\noutside its doors. Last year, our researchers\nlooked at security trends in the news. This\nyear, we turned our attention to what drew\ninterest at information security conferences in\n2014 and 2015.\n\n\nWe discerned a number of security trends,\nbased on analyzed abstracts for 4239\naccepted talks at more than 80 industryoriented conferences and six top-tier\nacademic security conferences. Because\na single talk can touch on more than one\ntheme, Figures 78 and 79 depict the overall\ndistributions for 12 security tracks that cover\nalmost every aspect of information security.\n(Note that we determined some talks to fit\ninto more than one category.)\n\n\nIn the industry sphere, threat and vulnerability\ntopics were the meat of the conference\nscene, with talks in this category appearing in\none-third of the abstracts analyzed. Privacy\ncontinues to excite discussion, as do GRC\n(governance, risk, and compliance) and mobile\ntopics. Despite high levels of industry chatter\nabout the Internet of Things, IoT-related\ntopics made a weak showing in both 2014 and\n2015, though both IoT and mobile saw slight\nbumps of a percentage point year over year.\nPrivacy, network security, and data security\nitself declined in interest to conference\norganizers as did, surprisingly, cloud security.\n\n\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35%\n\n21%\nPrivacy 19%\n\n11%\n\nCryptography 11%\n\n6%\n\nIoT 7%\n\n13%\n\nMobile 14%\n\n11%\n\nApplication security 11%\n\n13%\n\nNetwork security 11%\n\n15%\n\nGRC 15%\n\n13%\n\nData security 12%\n\n11%\n\nCloud security 9%\n\n9%\n\nOpSec/DevOp 9%\n\n6%\n\nFinance and healthcare security 6%\n\n\n2014 industry\n2015 industry\n\n\nThreat and vulnerability\n\n\n34%\n34%\n\n\nFigure 78 Presentation topics at industry-focused security conferences, 2014–15\n\n\n-----\n\nFor a lively privacy conversation, apparently\nacademic conferences are the place to be. The\nacademic conference sphere, we noted, tends\nto be a little more dynamic overall than that\nof industry. Here we see a significant rise in\nprivacy-related talks—up 11% year over year.\nThreat and vulnerability issues, data security,\nand cryptography rounded out the year’s\nbiggest conference attractions. (What is not\nknowable from this research, but what may\nbe visible as more data becomes available, is\nwhether increases in one sphere are echoed\nin the other.) Several themes showed a strong\nincrease in year-over-year presence including\nprivacy, crypto, data security, IoT, and cloud\n(the latter two with a 50% increase year over\nyear), while network security, GRC, and mobile\ndeclined.\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%\n\n34%\nPrivacy 45%\n\n\nCryptography\n\nIoT\n\nMobile\n\nApplication security\n\nNetwork security\n\nGRC\n\nData security\n\nCloud security\n\nOpSec/DevOp\n\nFinance and healthcare security\n\nThreat and vulnerability\n\n\n25%\n32%\n\n4%\n6%\n\n22%\n20%\n\n8%\n7%\n\n18%\n14%\n\n8%\n5%\n\n26%\n30%\n6%\n9%\n\n13%\n13%\n\n5%\n7%\n\n38%\n38%\n\n\n2014 academic\n2015 academic\n\n\nFigure 79 Presentation topics at academic security conferences, 2014–15\n\n\n-----\n\n|Academic|Change|\n|---|---|\n|Application, analysis|4.40%|\n|Network application|3.50%|\n|System, attack|3.40%|\n|Application, attack|3.30%|\n|Software, attack|3.20%|\n|Data, detection||\n\n|Industry|Change|\n|---|---|\n|Software, system|0.80%|\n|Application, system|0.70%|\n|System, exploit|0.70%|\n|Mobile, data|0.70%|\n|Attack, Internet|0.70%|\n|Internet, device Attack, detection|0.70%|\n|||\n||-0.50%|\n|Data, vulnerability|-0.50%|\n|Data, analysis|-0.50%|\n|Vulnerability, research|-0.70%|\n|Attack, threat|-0.80%|\n|Data, attack|-0.90%|\n\n|Application, device|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Application, protection|-0.50%|\n|Exploit, detection|-0.60%|\n|Mobile, application|-1.30%|\n|Mobile, device|-1.50%|\n|Attack, device|-3.10%|\n\n\nFigure 80 Trending terms in conference abstracts (numbers indicate the percentage changes in popularity between 2014 and 2015)\n\n\nFascinatingly, the industry chart appears\nto show a maturity process—specifically,\nthe move from simpler presentations on\npreliminary analysis and protection to topics\nthat are deeper and more intellectually\nweighty. In this light, it’s easy to see the rise\nof terms associated with threat intelligence,\nbest practices, security programs, and insider\nthreats. Likewise, we see the diminution\nof terms related to incident response, web\napplications, application security, critical\ninfrastructure, denial of service, and—\nironically—big data. It is, in fact, entirely\npossible that we are watching data research\ntransform into intelligence before our eyes.\n\n\n###### Gram analysis\n\nFinally, we analyzed the combinations of\ngrams in our dataset to see which topics\nshowed the most movement. Figure 80\nshows, for industry and academic\nconferences, the 12 terms with the most\nand the least change in occurrence between\n2014 and 2015. For the sake of readability we\nhave used full words, but the data analysis\nis designed to use grams (essentially, word\nfragments to gather all appropriate tenses,\ncombinations, singular/plural usages, and\nso on—for instance, “internet of things” in\nthis chart actually covered “IoT,” “Internet of\nThings,” and “Internet-of-Things” in our\ndata analysis.\n\n\nAs we see, terms related to threat intelligence\nand the Internet of Things increased in\nfrequency of use in the industry sphere,\nwhile the academic side tended toward more\ndiverse security-related terms (e.g., control\nflow, memory disclosure, key exchange, static\nanalysis). The data also seems to bolster the\ntraditional impression in both spheres that\nindustry talks tend to focus more on the big\nsecurity picture, while academic speakers\ndelve into the nitty-gritty details of problems.\n\n\n-----\n\nContinued world instability also brought the\ntopic of surveillance and encryption into the\nminds of many. If surveillance manages time\nand again to seem like a white knight after\nterrorist incidents, encryption is often the\ndragon. In the days after the terrorist attacks\non Paris, various simmering encryptionrelated debates were back on the boil, despite\nearly evidence that encryption played no role\nin the terrorists’ planning. Governments wish\nto monitor communications for significant\nthreats, but doing so in a manner that does\nnot interfere with civil liberties has proven\nproblematic. This is coupled with the fact\nthat current surveillance programs have not\nyielded the expected results.\n\nWhile the breaches at OPM and Ashley\nMadison seem unrelated on the surface, both\nbreaches had potentially terrible effects on\npeople who never had direct contact with\neither agency. Despite the three years of\ncredit counseling offered to persons whose\nnames were revealed in the OPM breach,\nit’s a relatively good bet that the stolen data\nwasn’t meant for the hands of criminal gangs\nor identity thieves. Among the rich trove of\ndata taken was, it is believed, data entered\ninto Standard Form-86s, a document required\nfor the background checks needed to obtain a\nsecurity clearance. The form provides a great\ndeal of information about one’s family, friends,\nand associates—for security and intelligence\nprofessionals, a delicate situation. In other\nwords, the true targets of the breach may be\npeople who never consented to inclusion in\nthe OPM database.\n\n\n###### Summary\n\nIf 2014 was dubbed the “Year of the Breach,”\nit could be argued 2015 became the “Year of\nCollateral Damage.” While Target and Home\nDepot previously grabbed headlines for the\nloss of customer data, the attacks on OPM\nand Ashley Madison demonstrated a level\nof impact beyond just credit card numbers.\nThis year’s Risk Report details the evolving\nnature of cybercrime as well as the developing\nlegislation meant to curtail it. The report\nmoves beyond the various techniques used\nby attackers, still driven primarily by financial\ninterests, to delve into what defenders now\nface as they look to secure their enterprise.\n\n2015 marks two decades of bug-bounty\nprograms as well as the 10th anniversary\nof the ZDI program. During that time,\nvarious markets developed for researchers\nto highlight their work. The vulnerability\nwhite market has had a tremendous positive\neffect in securing the landscape by bringing\nresearchers and vendors together. We expect\nthe vulnerability market will continue to\nevolve as more and more vendors announce\ntheir own programs to incentivize research,\nfurther monetizing the value of independent\nsecurity research.\n\nWe also anticipate regulations and legislation\nto affect the nature of disclosure. The impact\nof the Wassenaar Arrangement continues to\nhave a ripple effect on the security research\ncommunity. The recent inclusion of “intrusion\nsoftware” under the Wassenaar Arrangement\nseems to be a backlash reaction to offensive\nsecurity offerings. As the number of cyber\n\nattacks continues to grow, there will likely be\na corresponding response by governments\nto implement laws on how the information\nsecurity industry operates. The end result\nof additional legislation related to security\nresearch will be that creating better protection\nsolutions becomes harder and takes more\ntime. This, in turn, increases the likelihood\nof successful breaches as the environment\nfavors those researchers and agencies\noperating in the black market.\n\nThese legislative changes will certainly have\nan effect on the nature of disclosure. While\nthe environment in which the information\nsecurity community operates evolves, it is in\nall of our best interest to continue to find and\ndisclose security bugs in popular software so\nvendors can fix things in a timely manner. The\nincreasing complexity aside, it continues to be\nan endeavor worth doing.\n\nThis year also saw renewed efforts\nto decouple security and privacy. For\nenterprises, international data-privacy issues\nyears in the making came to a head when\nEurope’s highest court struck down the pact\nthat allowed US and European interests to\nshare data that has privacy considerations.\nThe dissolution of the long-standing EU-US\nSafe Harbor agreement sent vendors to put\ntogether alternate data-transfer mechanisms\neven as regulators came knocking.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the case of the Ashley Madison breach,\ninformation about an individual could\npotentially be derived even if it did not\nspecifically appear in the data (e.g., a spouse’s\nname and address would be obvious to a\nnosy neighbor). Again, even if it is unlikely\nthe data leaked will end up being used by\nidentity thieves, it could certainly have lifechanging consequences. It’s chilling to think\nthat the exposure of data accessible through\nthe Internet could have such a life-altering\neffect, but as more and more data migrates\nonline, the scenario is likely to repeat itself\nunless data protections—namely privacy\nsafeguards—are held firmly in place.\n\nIn the realm of security updates, the record\nnumber of point fixes for individual issues\nshows vendors are capable of keeping up with\nthe current rate of vulnerability disclosures.\nWhat is not clear is whether this rate is\nsustainable. As evidenced with Microsoft\nweb browsers, the inclusion of wide-reaching\ndefensive strategies demonstrates how\nthese fixes disrupt classes of attacks in an\nasymmetric fashion. Instead of releasing\npatches to fix many different vulnerabilities,\nthese defensive measures take out the entire\nclass—at least for some period of time.\nOther vendors would do well to consider\nimplementing similar strategies to disrupt\nclasses of attacks.\n\nDespite the advancement of defensive\nstrategies, malware continues to be a\npervasive piece of life online. However, this\npast year did see a shift in the focus of\nmalware. While always disruptive, today’s\nmalware has become focused more on\nmoney than on disruption of services. The\never-present ATM has become the focus\nfor many of these attacks, with malware\nauthors targeting the users of ATMs and the\nmachines themselves. While coordinated law\nenforcement efforts achieved takedowns\nof banking Trojan infrastructure, statistics\nshow the attackers are capable of restoring\nservices to the botnets in a surprisingly\nrapid fashion. As more and more of our\nfinancial transactions occur online, criminals\nwill continue to target these transactions\n\n\nfor profit. Put simply, if there is money to\nbe made, there is money to be stolen. The\nindustry must focus on securing these\ntransactions to deprive attackers of the illicit\nincome they so desire.\n\nOur yearly analysis of trends in application\nsecurity provides a unique snapshot of the\nstate of applications security during the\npast year. As in previous years, all identified\nissues were classified according to the HPE\nSoftware Security Taxonomy. During 2015, the\ntaxonomy extended further to include other\nassessment techniques and HPE Security\nFortify products such as HPE Security Fortify\non Demand (FOD).\n\nGenerally, the breakdown of application\nsecurity issues between 2014 and 2015 is\nstrikingly similar. Year-to-year changes in\nthe rankings for the three kingdoms with\nthe lowest representation (API Abuse, Code\nQuality, and Time and State) are primarily\ndue to changes to the HPE Software\nSecurity Taxonomy itself; the most prevalent\nvulnerabilities remain the same for both\nyears. Mobile applications present different\nissues from those seen in non-mobile\napplications. Security Features continues to\nbe the most represented kingdom for both\nweb applications and mobile applications.\nStill, mobile applications tend to see over 10%\nmore issues related to security features than\ndo web applications. For mobile applications,\nit’s internal system information leaks that lead\nthe most common list. Remediation of these\nmobile issues remains a concern. Only 48%\nof the mobile issues in our sample seem to\nhave been remediated—a stark difference\nfrom the 92% we saw on the applications side.\nTheir very large presence atop the list of most\nfrequently encountered mobile vulnerabilities\nindicates that a substantial majority of the\napplications we saw are storing sensitive\ninformation on devices that can be left on\nrestaurant tables, stolen from backpacks, and\ndropped in toilets.\n\n\nIn security operations, the reactive nature\nof security monitoring is commonly the\nsubject of complaints. In a reactive system,\nevents must occur before they can be\ndetected, as opposed to the more proactive\nprevention approach. The reactive-proactive\nconversation must occur within the context of\nthe technology available, the most common\nof which is SIEM. While the use of security\nintelligence systems has been shown to\nequate to potentially millions of dollars in\nsavings, implementation is not without its\nhazards. An operations analyst’s ability to\ndetect an event is predicated on his ability\nto see relevant event data. As data sources\ncontinue to grow, enterprises will need\nthe capability of storing and analyzing the\nmultitude of events gathered by various\nsensors. This requires investments in both\npeople and technologies. While these\ninvestments have an initial outpouring of\ncapital, the savings will be seen in preventing\nand responding to the inevitable breach.\n\nIn the coming years, the complexities of\nlegislation and international events will have\na greater impact in the realms of security and\nprivacy. As a result, network defenders need\nto understand the complexities of privacy\nissues as thoroughly as they understand the\nimpact of security vulnerabilities. Instead of\nsymmetric responses to threats, tomorrow’s\nnetwork defender must understand how to\nrespond asymmetrically to threats through\nautomated analysis, wide-reaching fixes,\nand a community-based defense. While the\nthreat of cyber-attack is unlikely to go away,\nthoughtful planning can continue to increase\nboth the physical and intellectual price an\nattacker must pay to successfully exploit\nan enterprise.\n\n\n-----\n\nKen Tietjen\n\nJewel Timpe\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Glossary\n\nAmicus brief\n\nA brief filed to a court by someone who\nis not a party to a case on which they are\ncommenting (amicus curiae, “friend of\nthe court”).\n\nAPI (application programming interface)\n\nA set of tools and resources that provide\nvarious functions developers can utilize\nwhen creating software.\n\nAshley Madison\n\nAshley Madison is a Canada-based online\ndating service and social networking service\nmarketed to people who are married or in a\ncommitted relationship. The company was\nbreached in July 2015.\n\nASLR (address space layout randomization)\n\nA security mechanism where the locations of\nimportant elements of a program in memory\nare randomized in order to make them\nharder for an attacker to find and utilize. This\nincreases the difficulty for the attacker to\nperform particular types of exploits that rely\non jumping to particular address areas\nof memory.\n\nATM (automated teller machine)\n\nAn electronic telecommunications device\nthat enables the customers of a financial\ninstitution to perform financial transactions,\nparticularly cash withdrawal, without the need\nfor a human cashier, clerk, or bank teller.\n\nBuffer overrun/overflow\n\nA buffer overflow is a type of vulnerability\nthat arises when a program writes an\nexcessive amount of data to the buffer,\nexceeding the capacity of the buffer and\nthen overwriting adjacent memory. This type\nof vulnerability may be exploited to crash\nprograms or, with the correct manipulation\nby a skilled attacker, used to execute\narbitrary code on a targeted computer. Buffer\nvulnerabilities can be avoided by the use of\nbounds checking, which checks the capacity\nfor inputs before they are written.\n\nC&C: See Command and control\n\n\nCEN (European Committee for\nStandardization)\n\nAn EU body charged with establishing\nstandards for goods originating from any\nof the Union’s 28 member countries.\n\nCircuit Court (US)\n\nIn the US, the federal system of appellate\ncourts above the District Court level and\nbelow the US Supreme Court. There are 12\ngeographically defined circuits, including one\nfor Washington, DC. In addition, there is an\nadditional United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit whose (nationwide)\njurisdiction is based on subject matter.\n\nCookiejacking\n\nCookiejacking is a form of hacking wherein\nthe attacker can gain access to session\ncookies of a browser’s user.\n\nCommand and control (C&C)\n\nAs with many terms used in computer\nsecurity, this term has been borrowed from\nthe military. Similar to the military use of\nthe term it means a method of exercising\nauthority over resources; for example, a\ncommanding officer commanding his troops.\nThis term is often used in the context of\nmalware and botnets in particular, where a\nstructure is set up to command and control\nmany compromised computers from either a\ncentralized, or in some cases, decentralized\nposition. A centralized command and\ncontrol structure might be a single server\nthat compromised computers connect to in\norder to receive commands. A decentralized\ncommand and control structure could be one\nin which compromised computers connect\nto a peer-to-peer network, where commands\nare spread through the network from many\npossible nodes. Command and control is also\nknown as C2.\n\n\nCommand injection\n\nCommand injection occurs when an attacker\nis able to pass unsafe data to a system shell\nvia a vulnerable application so that the unsafe\ndata is then executed on the targeted system.\nThe result therefore of a successful command\ninjection attack is the execution of arbitrary\nattacker-supplied code on a targeted system.\nThe risk of command injection attacks can be\nmitigated by appropriate input checking and\nvalidation.\n\nCross-frame scripting\n\nA form of cross-site scripting attack, in which\nattackers exploit a vulnerability in a web\nbrowser in order to load malicious thirdparty content that they control in the frame\nof a webpage on another site. This attack\nmay allow an attacker to steal sensitive\ninformation, such as login details, that may\nbe input into the frame because the targeted\nuser believes the request for login details\ncame from the legitimate site.\n\nCross-site scripting\n\nAn attack that occurs when an attacker\nexploits a vulnerability in web applications in\norder to inject malicious code into client-side\ncode that is delivered from a compromised\nwebsite to an unsuspecting user. The code\nthat is delivered to the user is trusted, and\nhence executed, as it appears to come from a\nlegitimate source. These types of attack occur\ndue to insufficient checking and validation\nof user-supplier input. Attackers may use\nthis type of attack in order to bypass access\ncontrols or steal sensitive data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Glossary\n\nCVSS (Common Vulnerabilities\nScoring System)\n\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring\nSystem (CVSS) is an open framework for\ncommunicating the characteristics and\nseverity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS\nconsists of three metric groups: Base,\nTemporal, and Environmental. The Base\ngroup represents the intrinsic qualities of a\nvulnerability, the Temporal group reflects\nthe characteristics of a vulnerability that\nchange over time, and the Environmental\ngroup represents the characteristics of a\nvulnerability that are unique to a user’s\nenvironment. The Base metrics produce a\nscore ranging from 0 to 10, which can then\nbe modified by scoring the Temporal and\nEnvironmental metrics. A CVSS score is also\nrepresented as a vector string, a compressed\ntextual representation of the values used to\nderive the score.\n\nDEP (data execution prevention)\n\nA security measure used by modern\noperating systems that is intended to\nprevent the running of malicious code on an\naffected system. It operates by marking areas\nof memory as either executable or nonexecutable and raises exceptions when code\nattempts to run from areas that are deemed\nnon-executable.\n\nDLL (dynamic link library)\n\nA dynamic link library (DLL) is a collection of\nsmall programs, any of which can be called\nwhen needed by a larger program. DLLs are\nMicrosoft’s iteration of the “shared library”\nconcept used on other platforms.\n\nExploit\n\nCode written expressly to take advantage\nof the security gap created by a particular\nvulnerability in order to deliver a malicious\npayload. Exploits may be targeted at specific\norganizations or used en masse in order\nto compromise as many hosts as possible.\nDelivery mechanisms utilize many different\ntechnologies and vehicles and often contain\na social engineering element—effectively an\nexploit against vulnerabilities in human nature\nin order to make the victim take a particular\naction of the attacker’s choosing.\n\n\nExternal leakage\n\nAn external information leak occurs when\nsystem data or debugging information leaves\nthe program open to a remote machine via a\nsocket or network connection.\n\nNational Security Letters\n\nA subpoena letter issued by the US federal\ngovernment in order to gather information\nrelated to issues of national security. The\nPatriot Act gave the FBI greatly expanded\npower to demand certain records, including\nISP information.\n\nOPM (Office of Personnel Management)\n\nIn the US, the Office of Personnel\nManagement is a federal department\nthat handles human resources issues for\ngovernment employees.\n\nPCI-DSS\n\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard was developed by the payment card\nindustry as a framework for secure handling\nand storage processes for information\nrelated to credit, debit, and similar cards. It\nis managed by the PCI Security Standards\nCouncil.\n\nPII\n\nPersonally identifiable information. The\ndefinition of what kinds of data are to be\ntreated as PII varies from jurisdiction to\njurisdiction.\n\nPOODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded\nLegacy Encryption)\n\nThe POODLE attack was a 2014 man-in-themiddle exploit that took advantage of Internet\nand security software clients’ fallback to\nSSL 3.0.\n\nRemote code execution (RCE) vulnerability\n\nA vulnerability that allows attackers to\nexecute their own code on a target system.\nDepending on the vulnerability used, the RCE\nmay be executed with either user- or systemlevel permissions.\n\nROP (return oriented programming)\n\nAn exploit technique that allows an attacker\nto execute code while bypassing certain types\nof defense-in-depth measures, such as ASLR.\n\n\nSafe Harbor\n\nGenerally, a provision within a statute or\nregulation that states that specified behaviors\nare not in violation of that law. In the privacy\nrealm, it refers to a framework developed by\nthe US and the European Union describing\nhow US companies could receive, handle, and\nuse European citizens’ personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) without running afoul of\nEuropean privacy laws.\n\nSecure Data Act\n\nProposed US legislation that would forbid\nfederal agencies from requiring private\nenterprises to build technology into products\nfor government surveillance purposes.\n\nShellcode\n\nA small piece of code used as the payload\nduring the exploitation of a vulnerability.\nWhile these types of payloads typically\nstart from a command shell, any code that\nperforms a similar function is generically\nreferred to as shellcode.\n\nSmall and midsize business (SMB)\n\nA small and midsize business (SMB) is a\nbusiness which, due to its size, has different\nIT requirements—and often faces different IT\nchallenges—than do large enterprises, and\nwhose IT resources (usually budget and staff)\nare often highly constrained.\n\nSTIX (Structured Threat Information\nExpression) and TAXII (Trusted Automated\nExchange of Indicator Information)\n\nAn open community-driven effort and a\nset of free, available specifications that\nhelp with the automated exchange of\ncyber-threat information. This allows cyberthreat information to be represented in a\nstandardized format. They are not pieces of\nsoftware themselves, but rather standards\nthat software can use. The combination\nof STIX and TAXII allows participants to\nmore easily share threat information with\nconstituents and peers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Glossary\n\nSOC (security operations center)\n\nA business unit that deals with enterprise\nsecurity issues, both ongoing and responsive,\nincluding the processing of data, alerts, and\nlogs pertaining to the enterprise’s security.\nDoes not necessarily refer to a physical space.\n\nTrojan\n\nMalicious software that, unlike worms or\nviruses, is unable to spread of its own accord.\nThere are many different types of Trojans\nthat are used in conjunction with other types\nof malware in order to perpetrate computer\ncrime. One of the most notorious types is a\nremote access Trojan (RAT) that can be used\nby a remote attacker to access and control a\nvictim’s computer.\n\nUSA Freedom Act\n\nA 2015 law that restored certain provisions of\nthe Patriot Act that had sunsetted earlier in\nthe year. The name is an acronym for\n“Uniting and Strengthening America by\nFulfilling Rights and Ensuing Effective\nDiscipline Over Monitoring Act.”\n\nUSA Patriot Act\n\nIn the US, a set of laws passed in the wake\nof the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\nThe name is an acronym for “Uniting\nand Strengthening America by Providing\nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and\nObstruct Terrorism Act.”\n\nUse-after-free\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability can occur\nwhen memory is allocated to an object that\nis used after it is deleted (or deallocated).\nGood programming practice dictates that\nany reference pointing to an object should be\nmodified when the memory is deallocated,\nto keep the pointer from continuing to\nmake the area of memory where the object\nonce resided available for use. (A pointer in\nthis abandoned condition is broadly called\na “dangling pointer.”) If the pointer isn’t\nmodified and tries to access that area of\nmemory, the system can become unstable\nor corrupt. Attackers can use a dereferenced\npointer in a variety of ways, including\nexecution of malicious code.\n\n\nVulnerability\n\nDefects or bugs that allow for external\ninfluence on the availability, reliability,\nconfidentiality, or integrity of software or\nhardware. Vulnerabilities can be exploited\nto subvert the original function of the\ntargeted technology.\n\nWassenaar Arrangement\n\nAgreement to establish the Wassenaar\nArrangement was reached on 19 December\n1995 in Wassenaar, near The Hague, in the\nNetherlands. The Wassenaar Arrangement\nhas been established in order to contribute\nto regional and international security\nand stability, by promoting transparency\nand greater responsibility in transfers of\nconventional arms and dual-use goods and\ntechnologies, thus preventing destabilizing\naccumulations. The aim is also to prevent the\nacquisition of these items by terrorists. There\nare currently 41 participating\nstates (countries).\n\nWorm\n\nA self-contained malicious program that\nis able to spread of its own accord. The\nclassification “worm” is only used to describe\nthe ability to spread without a host file (as\nmay be the case with computer viruses) and\nworms contain many different and varied\npayloads beyond spreading from host system\nto host system.\n\nYARA\n\nYARA is a tool to aid malware researchers in\nidentifying and classifying malware samples.\nYARA allows for the creation of malware\nfamily descriptions based on textual or\nbinary patterns.\n\nZero day\n\nA previously unknown vulnerability for which\nno patch from the vendor currently exists. It is\nreferred to as a zero day because the vendor\nhas had zero days to fix the issue.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sign up for updates**\n\nRate this document\n\n\n##### Learn more at\n###### hp.com/go/hpsr\n\n© Copyright 2016 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP.
