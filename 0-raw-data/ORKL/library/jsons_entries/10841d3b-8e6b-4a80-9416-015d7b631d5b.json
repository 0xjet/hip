Earlier this year, Mandiant researchers observed Batloader using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/seo-poisoning-batloader-atera)\nin its attacks.\n\nBatloader is associated with an intrusion set that we have dubbed “Water Minyades.” The actors behind Water Minyades are known for\ndelivering other malware during the last quarter of 2022, such as Qakbot, RaccoonStealer, and Bumbleloader via social engineering\ntechniques.\n\nIn this blog entry, we discuss notable Batloader campaigns that we’ve observed in the last quarter of 2022, including the abuse of custom\naction scripts from the Advanced Installer software and Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset, the use of obfuscated JavaScript files as a firststage payload, and the use of PyArmor tool to obfuscate Batloader Python scripts. We also shed light on noteworthy Water Minyades-related\nevents and give a detailed look at Batloader’s technical details.\n\n## Batloader’s Capabilities\n\nThe table below summarizes the capabilities of Batloader:\n\nCapability Description\n\nAnti-sandbox Batloader is usually inflated to a very large size by being bundled to a legitimate installer file. This can prevent sandboxes\nwith file size limits from properly detonating and observing the behavior of the file.\n\n\nFingerprints\nhost\n\nCommunicates\nwith C&C\n\n\nBatloader fingerprints the host to determine if it is a legitimate victim. It checks for environment artifacts such as the user,\ncomputer name, and if it is domain-joined.\n\nBatloader is a modular malware that communicates with its C&C server and has been observed to drop malware according\nto the specifications of the victim host it has infected. If the victim host belongs to an enterprise environment, it is more\nlikely to drop remote management tool Atera and Cobalt Strike beacon, which would then lead to ransomware deployment.\n\n\n-----\n\nStops security\nsoftware\nservices\n\nEscalates\nprivileges\n\nEvades\nantivirus (AV)\nsolutions\n\nInstalls other\ncomponents\n\nInstalls\nadditional\nmalware\n\n\nBatloader executes open-sourced scripts that attempt to stop services related to security software, such as Windows\nDefender.\n\nBatloader abuses legitimate tools like NirCmd.exe and Nsudo.exe to escalate privileges.\n\nBatloader uses different techniques to attempt evading antivirus solutions, such as hyperinflating MSI file sizes for antivirus\nengines that have file size limits, using noticeably short modular scripts that can be hard to structurally detect, acquiring\nlegitimate digital signatures for the MSI files, obfuscating scripts connecting to the Batloader command and control (C&C)\nservers, and abusing legitimate file sharing services to host malware payloads.\n\nBatloader uses a modular approach wherein the first-stage payload of the campaign is usually an MSI file bundled with\ncustom action scripts. The other components of the campaign, including the legitimate tools it will download to escalate its\nprivileges and download other malware, will be downloaded by these scripts.\n\nBatloader has been observed to drop several malware payloads, such as Ursnif, Vidar, Bumbleloader, RedLine Stealer,\nZLoader, Cobalt Strike, and SmokeLoader. It can also drop legitimate remote management tools, such as Syncro and\nAtera. We have also seen Batloader being a key enabler for Royal ransomware, the second-most prevalent ransomware\nfamily we have been observing recently.\n\n\nTable 1. Batloader's capabilities\n\n## Examining the Water Minyades Intrusion Set\n\nWater Minyades is known for heavily relying on defense evasion techniques, one of which is deploying payloads with very large file sizes to\nevade sandbox analysis and antivirus engines’ file size limits. Water Minyades also abuses legitimate tools, such as system management tool\nNSudo and email and file encryption tool Gpg4win, to elevate privileges and decrypt malicious payloads. This intrusion set also abuses MSI\n[files’ legitimate digital signatures, exploits vulnerabilities related to Windows’ PE Authenticode signatures to execute malicious scripts that have](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/seo-poisoning-batloader-atera)\nbeen appended to signed DLLs (dynamic-link libraries) and uses scripts that can be easily modified to evade scanning engines that rely on\nstructural signature detection techniques.\n\nUsing Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN) feedback data, we determined that Batloader attacks are mostly deployed in the\nUnited States, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.\n\nCountry Percentage of Attacks\n\nUnited States 61\n\nCanada 8\n\nGermany 8\n\nJapan 4\n\nUnited Kingdom 3\n\nAustralia 2\n\nBrazil 2\n\nNetherlands 2\n\nPoland 1\n\nSingapore 1\n\nOthers 8\n\nTable 2. Distribution of Batloader attacks in Q4 2022\n\nAfter tracking the activities related to Water Minyades and back tracking since early 2020, we were able to determine several noteworthy\nevents in this timeline:\n\nPeriod Water Minyades attack details\n\n\nH2\n2020\n\nOct.\n2020\n\n\nAn open-source intelligence report indicates that this was when the intrusion set became active. During this time, the group’s most\n[dropped payload was the Smokeloader malware, and it also heavily used exploit kits such as Rig and Fallout.](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/09/malvertising-campaigns-come-back-in-full-swing)\n\nThe group behind the intrusion set stopped using exploit kits in favor of social engineering schemes, which meant that targets were\n[no longer limited to Internet Explorer users. They posted malicious advertisements on porn websites to lure victims into](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/11/malsmoke-operators-abandon-exploit-kits-in-favor-of-social-engineering-scheme)\ndownloading a fake Java MSI, which then led to the deployment of Zloader payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nFeb.\n2022\n\nSep.\n2022\n\nOct.\n2022\n\nDec.\n2022\n\n\nThe group behind Water Minyades distributed Batloader using SEO poisoning techniques to trick victims into downloading\nlegitimate software and applications that were trojanized with malware script. During this time, Batloader dropped Zloader and\nlegitimate remote-management tool Atera to enterprise victim machines. Batloader was also observed using the PE (portable\n[executable) polyglotting technique, which is the process of executing signed DLL files with appended malicious scripts.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/seo-poisoning-batloader-atera)\n\nInitial Batloader infections were observed to have led to Cobalt Strike deployments and Royal ransomware infections.\n\n[Water Minyades actors abused Google Ads and the legitimate Keitaro Traffic Direction System (TDS) to redirect victims into](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/17/dev-0569-finds-new-ways-to-deliver-royal-ransomware-various-payloads/)\ndownloading Batloader malware.\n\nWater Minyades actors used JavaScript instead of MSI files as a first-stage payload. The group eventually obfuscated the\ndownloader of the JavaScript files.\n\n\nTable 3. Water Minyades’ noteworthy events from 2020 to 2022\n\n## A Technical Analysis of Batloader\n\nBatloader usually arrives via malicious websites that impersonate legitimate software or applications. Victims can be redirected to these\nwebsites via malvertising techniques and fake comments on forums containing links that lead to Batloader distribution websites.\n\nBased on our investigation, we determined that Batloader impersonates a slew of legitimate software and application websites in its campaign:\n\nAdobe\nAnyDesk\nAudacity\nBlender\nCCleaner\nFileZilla\nFortinet\nFoxit\nGetNotes\nGoogle Editor\nGrammarly\nJava\nKMSAuto\nLogmeIn\nLuminar\nMinersoft\nPutty\nSchwab\nSlack\nTeamViewer\nTradingView\nuTorrent\nWinRAR\nZoho\nZoom\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Examples of malicious websites that distribute Batloader\nWhen victims select the “Install” or “Download” option, the Batloader package will be downloaded to the system via a .ZIP file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Typical Batloader kill chain\nThe stages below are typical Water Minyades techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) but may vary slightly over time.\n\nStage Stage No. Description\n\nArrival 1 Water Minyades actors create malicious\nadvertisements that abuse legitimate services such\nas Google Ads and Keitaro TDS. These malicious\nadvertisements lead victims to malicious websites\nthat aim to resemble the legitimate websites of\npopular software and applications.\n\nInfection 2 Victims are lured into installing a malicious file from\nthe fake website. Based on recent Water Minyades\nactivities, this can take the form of an MSI, VHD\n(Virtual Hard Disk), VHDX (Virtual Hard Disk v2), or\na JavaScript file.\n\n3 Earlier campaigns that used MSI files were observed to drop PE polyglot\nbinaries containing malicious appended scripts. These scripts can be\nexecuted by MSHTA.exe due to a vulnerability in the PE Authenticode\nverification process. The MSI and VHD files usually contain a custom\naction script that is designed to connect to Batloader’s C&C server to\ndownload the next-stage payload.\n\n4 Water Minyades’ C&C server will decide which payload to drop.\n\n\n-----\n\nPostinfection\n\n\n5 Batloader can install different malware families, such\nas:\n\nBumble Loader\nCobalt Strike\nQakbot\nRaccoon Stealer\nRedLine Stealer\nSmoke Loader\nSystem BC\nUrsnif (Bot)\nVidar (Stealer)\nZLoader\n\nBased on our observations, these malware families’\npayloads are typically hyperinflated in size and are\nencrypted. Batloader can also install the following\nlegitimate applications to aid with other stages of the\nkill chain, such as privilege escalation and defense\nevasion:\n\nNsudo – Is abused to run processes with\nelevated privileges\nGpg4win – Is abused to decrypt next-stage\npayloads downloaded by Batloader.\nNirCmd – Is a command-line utility tool\nPowerShell – Is abused to run malicious\nPowerShell scripts\nMsiExec.exe – Is abused to run MSI files with\nmalicious custom action scripts\nMshta.exe – Is abused to execute malicious\ncode appended to PE files\n\nBatloader also abuses legitimate remote admin\ntools, such as Syncro and Atera, to facilitate\nransomware deployment.\n\n\n6 Second-stage malware like Ursnif, Cobalt Strike Beacon, and Bumblebee\nusually connect to their own C&C server to execute follow-on activities.\n\n7 Follow-on activities can include the deployment of ransomware families\nsuch as Royal.\n\nTable 4. Water Minyades attack stages\n\n## Batloader’s Notable Q4 Campaigns\n\nIn this section, we identify the different campaigns’ techniques observed. We see from the campaigns above that although the Batloader\nmalware is predominantly script-based, this intrusion set continuously finds ways to evade detection and improve its antianalysis techniques by\nutilizing legitimate tools to hide and obfuscate their scripts.\n\n**Abuse of custom action scripts of the Advanced Installer software**\n\nWe have observed that some Batloader MSI packages were used to abuse a legitimate installer file via a custom action PowerShell script.\nPotentially, this was carried out by abusing the Advanced Installer software 30-day free trial application form.\n\nFigure 4. Advanced Installer’s 30-day free\n\ntrial form abused by Water Minyades actors\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. An example of an MSI file with a custom action\n\nPowerShell script viewed using the Pe Studio tool\nIn Figure 6, we can see that the Batloader script was launched via the “PowerShellScriptLauncher.dll” file that was created using the Advanced\nInstaller software.\n\nFigure 6. Batloader\n\nscript launched via “PowerShellScriptLauncher.dll”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Batloader kill chain using compromised MSI package\nFrom our tracking, this technique was used in a number of campaigns between September 2022 and December 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Batloader C&C server activities abusing Advanced Installer software. Data taken from Trend Micro SPN.\n**Abuse of Windows Installer XML Toolset**\n\nAnother tool that was recently abused by Water Minyades actors was the WiX toolset.\n\nFigure 9. An example of an MSI file created using\n\nthe WiX toolset viewed using the PE Studio tool\nUsing this toolset, malicious actors can insert a custom action script and identify when it will be executed. In Figure 10, we can see that the\ncustom action \"checkforupdate.bat\" will be executed, which will also drop and execute additional malicious scripts inside the “update.zip” file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. A custom action created using the WiX toolset\n\nFigure 11. Snippet of code from checkforupdate.bat’s follow-on activities\nWe also observed a significant number of campaigns using this technique during the month of November 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Batloader C&C server activities abusing Windows Installer XML Toolset. Data taken from Trend Micro SPN.\n**Use of JavaScript files instead of MSI files in campaigns**\n\nStarting November 27, 2022, we observed that Water Minyades actors switched to using JavaScript files instead of MSI files as the initial\nBatloader payload.\n\nThis technique uses small-sized JavaScript files that have straightforward commands, ones that are also used for non-malicious purposes.\nThis is in direct contrast to the technique used with MSI files, wherein MSI file sizes are hyperinflated to evade scanning engines with file size\nlimitations.\n\nFrom a detection point of view, this can also pose as a challenge because the only malicious parts of the file are the C&C URLs themselves,\nsince a structure-based detection algorithm can also detect non-malicious JavaScript files.\n\nFigure 13. Contents of a Batloader JavaScript file\n\nnamed “InstallerV61.js”\nThis highlights the need for a multilayered security solution, one that can successfully detect malicious artifacts related to Batloader\ncampaigns.\n\nAfter a few days of analyzing this Batloader campaign, we have observed that the malicious actors behind it have obfuscated the JavaScript\nfiles as an additional detection evasion measure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. An obfuscated\n\nBatloader JavaScript file\n\nFigure 15. A typical execution chain for the JavaScript Batloader campaign\nBased on the distribution domains used in this campaign, we believe that this campaign was launched during Black Friday:\n\nlogmeinofferblackfriday[.]com\nanydeskofferblackfriday[.]com\nzoomofferblackfriday[.]com\nslackcloudservices[.]com\nanydeskofferblackfriday[.]com\n\nAccording to our telemetry, a significant number of campaigns used this technique between the end of November to the first week of\nDecember 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Batloader C&C server activities abusing JavaScript downloaders. Data taken from Trend Micro SPN.\n**Use of PyArmor tool to obfuscate Batloader Python script**\n\nAfter the JavaScript campaigns of Batloader, we observed since the second week of December 2022 that the group abused the Advanced\n[Installer Software again. This time the malicious file that it executed in the end is a Python script protected with PyArmor.](https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\nWe found a sample MSI file (SHA256: 2e65cfebde138e4dd816d3e8b8105e796c4eb38cfa27015938c0445ee5be8331), which is a trojanized\nChat Mapper installer masquerading as an Anydesk.msi installer. This installer was created using Advanced Installer application, and one of its\ncustomized actions is to execute a file called “viewer.exe” with the command line “#InstallPython.bat”.\n\nFigure 17. Custom Action script of the latest Batloader campaign observed in Q4 2022\nThe file InstallPython.bat will install Python 3.9.9, copy and extract the openssl.zip archive, and run the PyArmor encrypted Python script\nnamed main4.py.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. InstallPython.bat\n\nPyArmor is a free-with-restrictions command line tool that can be used to obfuscate Python scripts. The obfuscated Python file in this case is\nnamed main4.py:\n\nFigure 19. Batloader PyArmor-protected Python script\n[Deobfuscating this script using the techniques identified by PyArmor Unpacker, we see that this script connects to the Batloader C&C](https://github.com/Svenskithesource/PyArmor-Unpacker)\nupdateclientssoftware[.]com. We’ve observed this Batloader C&C server active from the second week of December until the second week of\nJanuary 2023. We are continuously monitoring this campaign for any additional activities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Connecting to the Batloader C&C\nBatloader’s C&C Activities in Q4 2022\n\nWe started observing an increase in Water Minyades activity in September 2022, which was also the time when we started seeing Batloader\ndeploying Royal ransomware to its victims. The number of attacks peaked from November until the first week of December 2022.\n\nFigure 21. Batloader requests to C&C domain from October to December 2022. Data taken from Trend Micro SPN.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. Most requested Batloader C&C domains from October to December 2022. Data taken from Trend Micro SPN.\nThe C&C domain with the most number of requests for Q4 2022 is “installationupgrade6[.]com.” Interestingly, this was the first C&C domain\nused in the Batloader campaign via JavaScript droppers and Black Friday Sale-related malicious distribution websites.\n\nThis could mean that victims are more likely to fall for malvertising campaigns that promote sales or discounts. This highlights the massive\nimpact social engineering lures have on the success of these malicious campaigns.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on our investigation, Batloader is a highly evasive and evolutionary malware family capable of deploying different types of malware,\nincluding loaders, bots, and ransomware. Batloader tricks victims by using different malvertising and social engineering techniques to distribute\nmalicious payloads.\n\nBatloader is a prime example of a modern malware and a modular threat, and protecting systems against it requires not just one defensive\n[strategy, but a robust and multilayered solution that provides shared visibility from a central place. Trend Micro Vision One™ is a technology](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\nthat can provide powerful XDR capabilities that collect and automatically correlate data across multiple security layers — from email and\nendpoints to servers, cloud workloads, and networks. Trend Vision One can prevent attacks via automated protection, while also ensuring that\nno significant incidents go unnoticed.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nURLs\n\n105105105015[.]com       Batloader C&C server\n\n24xpixeladvertising[.]com    Batloader C&C server\n\nclodtechnology[.]com       Batloader C&C server\n\ncloudupdatesss[.]com       Batloader C&C server\n\nexternalchecksso[.]com     Batloader C&C server\n\ngrammarlycheck2[.]com     Batloader C&C server\n\ninstallationsoftware1[.]com  Batloader C&C server\n\ninstallationupgrade6[.]com  Batloader C&C server\n\ninternalcheckssso[.]com     Batloader C&C server\n\n\n-----\n\nt p e [ ]co at oade C&C se e\n\nupdatea1[.]com            Batloader C&C server\n\nupdateclientssoftware[.]com Batloader C&C server\n\nupdatecloudservice1[.]com  Batloader C&C server\n\n**SHA256** **Description** **Detection**\n\n\n23373654d02cb7eace932609826cca4f82fcac67ca44b9328baba385acc00c67 Component of\n2e65cfebde138e4dd816d3e8b8105e796c4eb38cfa27015938c0445ee5be8331\n\nf8f3f22425ea72fafba5453c70c299367bd144c95e61b348d1e6dda0c469e219 Component of\n2e65cfebde138e4dd816d3e8b8105e796c4eb38cfa27015938c0445ee5be8331\n\n\nBatloader\nFile\n\nBatloader\nFile\n\n\nTrojan.BAT.BATLOADER.A\n\nTrojan.Python.BATLOADER.A\n\nTrojan.JS.BATLOADER.SMYXCLAZ\n\nTrojan.JS.BATLOADER.SMYXCLAZ\n\nTrojan.JS.BATLOADER.SMYXCLAZ\n\nTrojan.JS.BATLOADER.SMYXCLAZ\n\nTrojan.Win32.BATLOADER.SMYXCK3Z\n\nTrojan.Win32.BATLOADER.SMYXCK3Z\n\nTrojan.Win32.BATLOADER.SMYXCK3Z\n\nTrojan.Win32.BATLOADER.SMYXCK3Z\n\nTrojan.Win32.BATLOADER.SMYXCK3Z\n\nTrojan.Win32.FRS.VSNW1DK22/Trojan.PS1.BAT\n\nTrojan.Win32.FRS.VSNW1DK22/Trojan.PS1.BAT\n\n\n61e0926120f49b3d5edf3a5e0842b04640911974ecbbc93b6b33ca20c1f981bc Batloader\nFile\n\n91730741d72584f96ccba99ac9387e09b17be6d64728673871858ea917543c1e Batloader\nFile\n\naef18b7ab1710aaeb0d060127750ba9d17413035309ec74213d538fb1b1bdf79 Batloader\nFile\n\ne7735cb541e7afd50759eae860b7d1a43d627fbf5cd96d016241084e91659817 Batloader\nFile\n\n23a5981d086242349f6e3476eff11ea3244cebef3d65c76c7bc74470c1ec4b49 Batloader\nFile\n\n3707ad9d9ea318757883ede9691e5c4e8d778c839a056f8b4a94ed47a76da2c8 Batloader\nFile\n\n86f6af51d30159f4d2e00ed733a88dc05cc5dd846b1b2d1ba30582f6e33ac998 Batloader\nFile\n\nb28047cda1c688c844f676e94770c08cf570f4d65fa4c5e4454ae449c2439e3f Batloader\nFile\n\ne1dcc098a6585dbbf4df64f09f8e8508e218485e1958fe6fe04b91547e109a83 Batloader\nFile\n\ne528cb5e7a2d04269d955ce771b7326bae929355807039f49106126b1a5ff227 Batloader\nFile\n\nfcbfbc2ae4ed3e51631ecb3184004d96f0a6fd5e9de55400dedfa6b5cafc7c41 Batloader\nFile\n\n\n-----",
