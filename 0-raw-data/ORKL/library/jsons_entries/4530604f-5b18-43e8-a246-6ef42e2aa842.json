The\nsummaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative\nsnapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT\nreports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people\nshould be aware of.\n\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q3 2020.\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more\n[information on a specific report are encouraged to contact intelreports@kaspersky.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## The most remarkable findings\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have already partly documented the activities of DeathStalker, a unique threat group that\nseems to focus mainly on law firms and companies operating in the financial sector. The\ngroup’s interest in gathering sensitive business information leads us to believe that\nDeathStalker is a group of mercenaries offering hacking-for-hire services, or acting as an\ninformation broker in financial circles. The activities of this threat actor first came to our\nattention through a PowerShell-based implant called Powersing. This quarter, we unraveled\nthe threads of DeathStalker’s LNK-based Powersing intrusion workflow. While there is\nnothing groundbreaking in the whole toolset, we believe defenders can gain a lot of value by\nunderstanding the underpinnings of a modern, albeit low-tech, infection chain used by a\nsuccessful threat actor. DeathStalker continues to develop and use this implant, using tactics\nthat have mostly been identical since 2018, while making greater efforts to evade detection.\nIn August, our [public report of DeathStalker’s activities summarized the three scripting](https://securelist.com/deathstalker-mercenary-triumvirate/98177/)\nlanguage-based toolchains used by the group – Powersing, Janicab and Evilnum.\n\nFollowing our initial private report on Evilnum, we detected a new batch of implants in late\nJune 2020, showing interesting changes in the (so far) quite static modus operandi of\nDeathStalker. For instance, the malware directly connects to a C2 server using an embedded\nIP address or domain name, as opposed to previous variants where it made use of at least\ntwo dead drop resolvers (DDRs) or web services, such as forums and code sharing\nplatforms, to fetch the real C2 IP address or domain. Interestingly, for this campaign the\nattackers didn’t limit themselves merely to sending spear-phishing emails but actively\nengaged victims through multiple emails, persuading them to open the decoy, to increase the\nchance of compromise. Furthermore, aside from using Python-based implants throughout\nthe intrusion cycle, in both new and old variants, this was the first time that we had seen the\nactor dropping PE binaries as intermediate stages to load Evilnum, while using advanced\ntechniques to evade and bypass security products.\n\nWe also found another intricate, low-tech implant that we attribute to DeathStalker with\nmedium confidence. The delivery workflow uses a Microsoft Word document and drops a\npreviously unknown PowerShell implant that relies on DNS over HTTPS (DoH) as a C2\nchannel. We dubbed this implant PowerPepper.\n\nDuring a recent investigation of a targeted campaign, we found a UEFI firmware image\ncontaining rogue components that drop previously unknown malware to disk. Our analysis\nshowed that the revealed firmware modules were based on a known bootkit named VectorEDK, and the dropped malware is a downloader for further components. By pivoting on\nunique traits of the malware, we uncovered a range of similar samples from our telemetry\nthat have been used against diplomatic targets since 2017 and have different infection\nvectors. While the business logic of most is identical, we could see that some had additional\nfeatures or differed in implementation. Due to this, we infer that the bulk of samples originate\n[from a bigger framework that we have dubbed MosaicRegressor. Code artefacts in some of](https://securelist.com/mosaicregressor/98849/)\nthe framework’s components, and overlaps in C2 infrastructure used during the campaign,\n\n\n-----\n\nsuggest that a Chinese-speaking actor is behind these attacks, possibly one that has\nconnections to groups using the Winnti backdoor. The targets, diplomatic institutions and\nNGOs in Asia, Europe and Africa, all appear to be connected in some way to North Korea.\n\n## Europe\n\n[Since publishing our initial report on WellMess (see our APT trends report Q2 2020), the UK](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/)\nNational Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has released a joint technical advisory, along with\nCanadian and US governments, on the most recent activity involving WellMess. Specifically,\nall three governments attribute the use of this malware targeting COVID-19 vaccine research\nto The Dukes (aka APT29 and Cozy Bear). The advisory also details two other pieces of\nmalware, SOREFANG and WellMail, that were used during this activity. Given the direct\npublic statement on attribution, new details provided in the advisory, as well as new\ninformation discovered since our initial investigation, we published our report to serve as a\nsupplement to our previous reporting on this threat actor. While the publication of the NCSC\nadvisory has increased general public awareness on the malware used in these recent\nattacks, the attribution statements made by all three governments provided no clear\nevidence for other researchers to pivot on for confirmation. For this reason, we are currently\nunable to modify our original statement; and we still assess that the WellMess activity has\nbeen conducted by a previously unknown threat actor. We will continue to monitor for new\nactivity and adjust this statement in the future if new evidence is uncovered.\n\n## Russian-speaking activity\n\nIn summer, we uncovered a previously unknown multimodule C++ toolset used in highly\ntargeted industrial espionage attacks dating back to 2018. So far, we have seen no\nsimilarities with known malicious activity regarding code, infrastructure or TTPs. To date, we\nconsider this toolset and the actor behind it to be new. The malware authors named the\n[toolset MT3, and based on this abbreviation we have named the toolset MontysThree. The](https://securelist.com/montysthree-industrial-espionage/98972/)\nmalware is configured to search for specific document types, including those stored on\nremovable media. It contains natural language artefacts of correct Russian and a\nconfiguration that seek directories that exist only in Cyrilic version of Windows, while\npresenting some false flag artefacts suggesting a Chinese-speaking origin. The malware\nuses legitimate cloud services such as Google, Microsoft and Dropbox for C2\ncommunications.\n\n## Chinese-speaking activity\n\nEarlier this year, we discovered an active and previously unknown stealthy implant dubbed\nMoriya in the networks of regional inter-governmental organizations in Asia and Africa. This\ntool was used to control public facing servers in those organizations by establishing a covert\nchannel with a C2 server and passing shell commands and their outputs to the C2. This\ncapability is facilitated using a Windows kernel mode driver. Use of the tool is part of an\n\n\n-----\n\nongoing campaign that we have named TunnelSnake. The rootkit was detected on the\ntargeted machines in May, with activity dating back as early as November 2019, persisting in\nnetworks for several months following the initial infection. We found another tool showing\nsignificant code overlaps with this rootkit, suggesting that the developers have been active\nsince at least 2018. Since neither rootkit nor other lateral movement tools that accompanied\nit during the campaign relied on hard-coded C2 servers, we could gain only partial visibility\ninto the attacker’s infrastructure. That said, the bulk of detected tools, apart from Moriya,\nconsisted of both proprietary and well-known pieces of malware that were previously used by\nChinese-speaking threat actors, giving a clue to the attacker’s origin.\n\nPlugX continues to be effectively and heavily used across Southeast and East Asia, and also\nAfrica, with some minimal use in Europe. The PlugX codebase has been in use by multiple\nChinese-speaking APT groups, including HoneyMyte, Cycldek and LuckyMouse.\nGovernment agencies, NGOs and IT service organizations seem to be consistent targets.\nWhile the new USB spreading capability is opportunistically pushing the malware throughout\nnetworks, compromised MSSPs/IT service organizations appear to be a potential vector of\ntargeted delivery, with CobaltStrike installer packages pushed to multiple systems for initial\nPlugX installation. Based on our visibility, the majority of activity in the last quarter appears to\nbe in Mongolia, Vietnam and Myanmar. The number of systems in these countries dealing\nwith PlugX in 2020 is at the very least in the thousands.\n\nWe discovered an ongoing campaign, dating back to May, utilizing a new version of the\nOkrum backdoor, attributed to Ke3chang. This updated version of Okrum uses an\nAuthenticode-signed Windows Defender binary using a unique side-loading technique. The\nattackers used steganography to conceal the main payload in the Defender executable while\nkeeping its digital signature valid, reducing the chance of detection. We haven’t previously\nseen this method being used in the wild for malicious purposes. We have observed one\naffected victim, a telecoms company located in Europe.\n\nOn September 16, the US Department of Justice released three indictments associated with\nhackers allegedly connected with APT41 and other intrusion sets tracked as Barium, Winnti,\nWicked Panda and Wicked Spider. In addition, two Malaysian nationals were also arrested\non September 14, in Sitiawan (Malaysia), for “conspiring to profit from computer intrusions\ntargeting the video game industry”, following cooperation between the US DoJ and the\nMalaysian government, including the Attorney General’s Chambers of Malaysia and the\nRoyal Malaysia Police. The first indictment alleges that the defendants set up an elite “white\nhat” network security company, called Chengdu 404 Network Technology Co, Ltd. (aka\nChengdu Si Lingsi Network Technology Co., Ltd.), and under its guise, engaged in computer\nintrusions targeting hundreds of companies around the world. According to the indictment,\nthey “carried out their hacking using specialized malware, such as malware that cybersecurity experts named ‘PlugX/Fast’, ‘Winnti/Pasteboy’, ‘Shadowpad’, ‘Barlaiy/Poison Plug’\n\n\n-----\n\nand Crosswalk/ProxIP . The indictments contain several indirect IoCs, which allowed us to\nconnect these intrusions to Operation ShadowPad and Operation ShadowHammer, two\nmassive supply-chain attacks discovered and investigated by Kaspersky in recent years.\n\n## Middle East\n\nIn June, we observed new activity by the MuddyWater APT group, involving use of a new set\nof tools that constitute a multistage framework for loading malware modules. Some\ncomponents of the framework leverage code to communicate with C2s identical to code we\nobserved in the MoriAgent malware earlier this year. For this reason, we decided to dub the\nnew framework MementoMori. The purpose of the new framework is to facilitate execution of\nfurther in-memory PowerShell or DLL modules. We detected high-profile victims based in\nTurkey, Egypt and Azerbaijan.\n\n## Southeast Asia and Korean Peninsula\n\nIn May, we found new samples belonging to the Dtrack family. The first sample, named\nValefor, is an updated version of the Dtrack RAT containing a new feature enabling the\nattacker to execute more types of payload. The second sample is a keylogger called Camio\nwhich is an updated version of its keylogger. This new version updates the logged\ninformation and its storage mechanism. We observed signs indicating that these malware\nprograms were tailored for specific victims. At the time of our research our telemetry\nrevealed victims located in Japan.\n\nWe have been tracking LODEINFO, fileless malware used in targeted attacks since last\nDecember. During this time, we observed several versions as the authors were developing\nthe malware. In May, we detected version v0.3.6 targeting diplomatic organizations located in\nJapan. Shortly after that, we detected v0.3.8 as well. Our investigation revealed how the\nattackers operate during the lateral movement stage: after obtaining the desired data, the\nattackers wipe their traces. Our private report included a technical analysis of the LODEINFO\nmalware and the attack sequence in the victim’s network, to disclose the actor’s tactics and\nmethods.\n\nWhile tracking Transparent Tribe activity, we discovered an interesting tool used by this APT\nthreat actor: the server component used to manage CrimsonRAT bots. We found different\nversions of this software, allowing us to look at the malware from the perspective of the\nattackers. It shows that the main purpose of this tool is file stealing, given its functionalities\nfor exploring the remote file system and collecting files using specific filters. Transparent\nTribe (aka PROJECTM and MYTHIC LEOPARD) is a very prolific APT group that has\nincreased its activities in recent months. We reported the launch of a new wide-ranging\ncampaign that uses the CrimsonRAT tool where we were able to set up and analyze the\nserver component and saw the use of the USBWorm component for the first time; we also\n\n\n-----\n\n[found an Android implant used to target military personnel in India. This discovery also](https://securelist.com/transparent-tribe-part-2/98233/)\nconfirms much of the information already discovered during previous investigations; and it\nalso confirms that CrimsonRAT is still under active development.\n\nIn April, we discovered a new malware strain that we named CRAT, based on the build path\nand internal file name. The malware was spread using a weaponized Hangul document as\nwell as a Trojanized application and strategic web compromise. Since its discovery the fullfeatured backdoor has quickly evolved, diversifying into several components. A downloader\ndelivers CRAT to profile victims, followed by next-stage orchestrator malware named\nSecondCrat: this orchestrator loads various plugins for espionage, including keylogging,\nscreen capturing and clipboard stealing. During our investigation, we found several weak\nconnections with ScarCruft and Lazarus: we discovered that several debugging messages\ninside the malware have similar patterns to ScarCruft malware, as well as some code\npatterns and the naming of the Lazarus C2 infrastructure.\n\nIn June, we observed a new set of malicious Android downloaders which, according to our\ntelemetry, have been actively used in the wild since at least December 2019; and have been\nused in a campaign targeting victims almost exclusively in Pakistan. Its authors used the\nKotlin programming language and Firebase messaging system for the downloader, which\nmimics Chat Lite, Kashmir News Service and other legitimate regional Android applications.\nA report by the National Telecom & Information Technology Security Board (NTISB) from\nJanuary describes malware sharing the same C2s and spoofing the same legitimate apps.\nAccording to this publication, targets were Pakistani military bodies, and the attackers used\nWhatsApp messages, SMS, emails and social media as the initial infection vectors. Our own\ntelemetry shows that this malware also spreads through Telegram messenger. The analysis\nof the initial set of downloaders allowed us to find an additional set of Trojans that we believe\nare strongly related, as they use the package name mentioned in the downloaders and focus\non the same targets. These new samples have strong code similarity with artefacts\npreviously attributed to Origami Elephant.\n\nIn mid-July, we observed a Southeast Asian government organization targeted by an\nunknown threat actor with a malicious ZIP package containing a multilayered malicious RAR\nexecutable package. In one of the incidents, the package was themed around COVID-19\ncontainment. We believe that the same organization was probably the same target of a\ngovernment web server watering-hole, compromised in early July and serving a highly\nsimilar malicious LNK. Much like other campaigns against particular countries that we have\nseen in the past, these adversaries are taking a long-term, multipronged approach to\ncompromising target systems without utilizing zero-day exploits. Notably, another group\n(probably OceanLotus) used a similar Telegram delivery technique with its malware implants\nagainst the same government targets within a month or so of the COVID-19-themed\nmalicious LNK, in addition to its use of Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn May 2020, Kaspersky technologies prevented an attack using a malicious script for\nInternet Explorer against a South Korean company. Closer analysis revealed that the attack\nused a previously unknown full chain that consisted of two zero-day exploits: a Remote Code\nExecution exploit for Internet Explorer and an Elevation of Privilege exploit for Windows.\nUnlike a previous full chain that we discovered, used in Operation WizardOpium (you can\nread more [here and here), the new full chain targeted the latest builds of Windows 10, and](https://securelist.com/chrome-0-day-exploit-cve-2019-13720-used-in-operation-wizardopium/94866/)\nour tests demonstrated reliable exploitation of Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 10 build\n18363 x64. On June 8, we reported our discoveries to Microsoft, who confirmed the\nvulnerabilities. At the time of our report, the security team at Microsoft had already prepared\na patch for vulnerability CVE-2020-0986 that was used in the zero-day Elevation of Privilege\nexploit; but before our discovery, the exploitability of this vulnerability had been considered\nless likely. The patch for CVE-2020-0986 was released on June 9. Microsoft assigned CVE2020-1380 to a use-after-free vulnerability in JScript and the patch for this was released on\n[August 11. We are calling this and related attacks Operation PowerFall. Currently, we are](https://securelist.com/ie-and-windows-zero-day-operation-powerfall/97976/)\nunable to establish a definitive link with any known threat actor, but due to similarities with\npreviously discovered exploits we believe that DarkHotel may be behind this attack.\n\nOn July 22, we came across a suspicious archive file that was uploaded to VirusTotal from\nan Italian source. The file seemed to be a triage consisting of malicious scripts, access logs,\nmalicious document files and several screenshots related to suspicious file detections from\nsecurity solutions. After looking into these malicious document files, we identified that they\nare related to a Lazarus group campaign that we reported in June. This campaign, dubbed\nDeathNote, targeted the automobile industry and individuals in the academic field using lure\ndocuments containing aerospace and defense-related job descriptions. We are confident that\nthese documents are related to a recently reported attack on an Israeli defense company.\nWe have uncovered webshell scripts, C2 server scripts and malicious documents, identified\nseveral victims connected to the compromised C2 server, as well as uncovering the method\nused to access the C2 server.\n\nWe have observed an ongoing Sidewinder campaign that started in February, using five\ndifferent malware types. The group made changes to its final payloads and continues to\ntarget government, diplomatic and military entities using current themes, such as COVID-19,\nin its spear-phishing efforts. While the infection mechanism remains the same as before,\nincluding the group’s exploit of choice (CVE-2017-1182) and use of the DotNetToJScript tool\nto deploy the final payloads, we found that the actor also used ZIP archives containing a\nMicrosoft compiled HTML Help file to download the last-stage payload. In addition to the\nexisting .NET-based implant, which we call SystemApp, the threat actor added JS\nOrchestrator, the Rover/Scout backdoor and modified versions of AsyncRAT, warzoneRAT to\nits arsenal.\n\n## Other interesting discoveries\n\n\n-----\n\nAttribution is difficult at the best of times, and sometimes it s not possible at all. While\ninvestigating an ongoing campaign, we discovered a new Android implant undergoing\ndevelopment, with no clear link to any previously known Android malware. The malware is\nable to monitor and steal call logs, SMS, audio, video and non-media files, as well as\nidentifying information about the infected device. It also implements an interesting feature to\ncollect information on network routes and topology obtained using the “traceroute” command\nas well as using local ARP caches. During this investigation we uncovered a cluster of\nsimilar Android infostealer implants, with one example being obfuscated. We also found\nolder Android malware that more closely resembles a backdoor, with traces of it in the wild\ndating back to August 2019.\n\nIn April, Cisco Talos described the activities of an unknown actor targeting Azerbaijan’s\ngovernment and energy sector using new malware called PoetRAT. In collaboration with\nKaspersky ICS CERT, we identified supplementary samples of associated malware and\ndocuments with broader targeting of multiple universities, government and industrial\norganizations as well as entities in the energy sector in Azerbaijan. The campaign started in\nearly November 2019; and the attackers switched off the infrastructure immediately following\npublication of the Cisco Talos report. We observed a small overlap in victimology with Turla,\nbut since there is no technically sound proof of relation between them, and we haven’t been\nable to attribute this new set of activity to any other previously known actor, we named it\nObsidian Gargoyle.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nThe TTPs of some threat actors remain fairly consistent over time (such as using hot topics\nsuch (COVID-19) to entice users to download and execute malicious attachments sent in\nspear-phishing emails), while other groups reinvent themselves, developing new toolsets and\nwidening their scope of activities, for example, to include new platforms. And while some\n[threat actors develop very sophisticated tools, for example, MosiacRegressor UEFI implant,](https://securelist.com/mosaicregressor/98849/)\nothers [have great success with basic TTPs. Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to](https://securelist.com/deathstalker-mercenary-triumvirate/98177/)\nhighlight the key developments of APT groups.\n\nHere are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q3 2020:\n\nGeo-politics continues to drive the development of many APT campaigns, as seen in\nrecent months in the activities of Transparent Tribe, Sidewinder, Origami Elephant and\nMosaicRegressor, and in the ‘naming and shaming’ of various threat actors by the\nNCSC and the US Department of Justice.\nOrganizations in the financial sector also continue to attract attention: the activities of\nthe mercenary group DeathStalker is a recent example.\nWe continue to observe the use of mobile implants in APT attacks with recent\nexamples including Transparent Tribe and Origami Elephant.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile APT threat actors remain active across the globe, recent hotspots of activity\nhave been Southeast Asia, the Middle East and various regions affected by the\nactivities of Chinese-speaking APT groups.\nUnsurprisingly, we continue to see COVID-19-themed attacks – this quarter they\nincluded WellMess and Sidewinder.\nAmong the most interesting APT campaigns this quarter were DeathStalker and\nMosaicRegressor: the former underlining the fact that APT groups can achieve their\naims without developing highly sophisticated tools; the latter representing the leadingedge in malware development.\n\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat\nlandscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve,\nthere is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Chinese-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/chinese-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Firmware](https://securelist.com/tag/firmware/)\n[Google Android](https://securelist.com/tag/google-android/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[MuddyWater](https://securelist.com/tag/muddywater/)\n[RAT Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/rat-trojan/)\n[Russian-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/russian-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nAPT trends report Q3 2020\n\nYour email address will not be published.
