It is a banking Trojan\nbuilt to steal financial data such as credentials and credit/debit card numbers, but not limited\nto this functionality. The propagation of this threat began during the 2018 Brazilian elections,\nregistering over 10,000 installations to April 2019 from the official Google Play Store alone.\n\nThis malware can perform tasks such as keystroke logging, screen recording, SMS\ninterception, and the theft of credit card and financial information. To trick users into\ndownloading the malware, the authors advertise it via Facebook and WhatsApp messages.\nCampaign’s new URLs redirect victims either to the official Google Play Store or to a website\nhosting malicious APK packages.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious applications used to distribute BasBanke, hosted in the Google Play Store.\n\nThe malicious applications hosted in Google Play Store disguise themselves as applications\nwith supposed functionality such as a secure QR reader, a fake app for a real travel agency\nwith travel deals, and – implementing a well-known trick – as an application to “see who\nvisited your profile.” The most widespread malicious application is a fake version of\nCleanDroid, first announced in a paid advertisement on Facebook, and linking to the\napplication hosted on the Play Store. This “miraculous” application promises to protect the\nvictim’s device against viruses, to optimize memory space, and to save data when using a\n3G or 4G connection. In reality it is a banking Trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious CleanDroid application shown in a Facebook advertisement.

A\nconsiderable number of Brazilian financial institutions and other popular websites such as\nSpotify, YouTube, and Netflix are on the target list. However, when it comes to stealing\nbanking credentials, metadata such as the device name, IMEI, and the telephone number\nused by the victim are sent to a remote C2. Why pay special attention to this data? Well,\nfraudsters need it to mimic legitimate access to the account of the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nMetadata extracted from the phone and sent to the remote C2.\n\nDepending on the version of the malware, we found different targets – and they are all\nfinancial institutions. In addition, an extensive list of keywords defines what other brands or\nwebsites will trigger the keylogging procedure.\n\nWe have previously found a few malicious campaigns similar to this but with significantly\nreduced distribution when compared to BasBanke. Another difference is that BasBanke uses\nFacebook and WhatsApp as a mass distribution vector. Also, it appears to have sparked new\nideas among Brazilian cybercriminal crews, by showing how easy it is to infect an Android\ndevice with a malicious application hosted in the official store. The attackers behind\n\n\n-----\n\nBasBanke have proved that the Play Protect feature is not enough to stop them and\neffectively block their malware. In fact, Basbanke is the forerunner of a larger malicious\ncampaign that we’ll be reporting on soon.\n\n**Reference IoC**\n\n**Hashes**\n\n00de6f665a41be232a4df975944a2580\n\n0f455547228459c65044845671c9de83\n\n5ff98c27c34ec90c82bb46c28453e3e0\n\n41301a295044410c41d547e6abc9a1a9\n\ne1dfeee5bb82b27c5866da16063aa833\n\n1aa0a4992168953a631a625ab181e236\n\n11edce35dad85f3e188bfd13b718d19c\n\n79cf391a3ae2477cd804c68850dba80d\n\n6938b27cdbc5ac5e98fd2a34bde034a6\n\n7e1bb73f514b6af7be16ab5bcb0efa5e\n\n**Domains**\n\ndodothebest.esy.es\n\nzalthome.esy.es\n\nservcobranca.in\n\nibercob.com.br\n\nrootcenter.com.br\n\nroyhols.com\n\nautopecasecreta.com.br\n\ninvestcerto.site\n\nbancobrasil.mobi\n\ncitiapp.mobi\n\nltau.mobi\n\nmoduloempresa.com\n\nnoisquevoa.mobi\n\npagseguro.mobi\n\naplicativo-sms.com\n\n[Interested in more information?
