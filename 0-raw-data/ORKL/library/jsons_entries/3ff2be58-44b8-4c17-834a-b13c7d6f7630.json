Threat actors of all kinds try to infiltrate corporate networks for\nreconnaissance, ransomware deployment, and plainly to steal money from those exchanges, specifically\nfrom their \"hot\" (i.e. active, connected) wallets. This kind of targets is somewhat unique, different from\ntraditional financial institutions for two reasons:\n\n  - Banks in general, and the SWIFT system in particular, are perceived as highly secured targets in\ncomparison to cryptocurrency exchanges. The lower security of those exchanges’ networks rises\ntheir potential as a lucrative target for cybercriminals.\n\n  - While at first it seems easier to track the stolen money through blockchain, identifying and\nattributing wallets to entities and individuals is generally more difficult.\n\nFrom the top 3 attacks against Coinbase, Upbit, and Binance (which was hacked at least twice and had\nits KYC[1] leaked), to smaller-scale but still sophisticated attacks, such as those carried out by the DPRKattributed group \"Lazarus\" (aka HIDDEN COBRA), or the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Ethereum\nplatform in the (ultimately unsuccessful) attack on Uniswap and Lenf.me[2], attacks against cryptoexchanges had had a discernible place in the 2019-early 2020 landscape.\n\nIn this research we would like to present a hidden and persistent group, that has been targeting cryptoexchanges, mainly in the US and Japan since as early as 2018, stealing millions' worth of cryptocoins; we\ntrack it as \"CryptoCore\" (or “Crypto-gang”), aka “Dangerous Password”[3], “Leery Turtle”[4].\n\nUnlike other reports about this threat actor, the CryptoCore report mainly focuses on the group’s profile,\nmodus operandi, and digital infrastructure. The “Dangerous Password” and “Leery Turtle” reports zoom\nin on different aspects of the operation (e.g. toolset, anti-software detection capabilities) and provide\ncomplementary findings to what is presented in this report.\n\nWe will briefly introduce the report with a general overview, and then proceed to discuss in detail its\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and also present one case study from our experience. We will\nconclude with a list of indicators of compromise (IoC).\n\nTo all future targeted cryptocurrency exchanges, we encourage your IR team to validate malicious\nactivity with our findings to fingerprint and mitigate additional CryptoCore operations. For further help,\nplease reach us out at info@clearskysec.com.\n\n1 \"Know Your Customer\" – a fairly common practice by crypto-exchanges to ask their customers to provide some\nidentification documents and/or photos\n2 zdnet.com/google-amp/article/hackers-steal-25-million-worth-of-cryptocurrency-from-uniswap-and-lendf-me/\n3 [https://www.secrss.com/articles/16505](https://www.secrss.com/articles/16505)\nhttps://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/offshore%20APT%20organization/DangerousP\nassword/2020-04-02/Analysis.md\n4 https://cyberstruggle.org/delta/LeeryTurtleThreatReport_05_20.pdf\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Introducing CryptoCore\n\nCryptoCore is a group that targets, as mentioned above, almost exclusively cryptocurrency exchanges\nand companies working with them via supply-chain attack. Although we have seen singular infections in\ndifferent countries, the group seems to focus on the United States, Japan, and other countries.\nThe CryptoCore group is known for having accumulated a sum of approximately 70mil USD from its\nheists on exchanges. We estimate that the group managed to rake in more than 200mil USD in two years.\nThis group is not extremely technically advanced, yet it seems to be swift, persistent, and effective,\nnevertheless. We assess it to be active at least since May 2018, judging from the timestamp of the first\nknown relevant sample, and it maintained steady activity since then. Its activity has receded in the first\nhalf of 2020, one possible reason being the limitations induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it didn't\nstop completely.\n\nFigure 1: CryptoCore operations timeline\n##### Attribution\nWe have been tracking CryptoCore group campaigns for almost two years, with no conclusive\nunderstanding of the operators’ origin; however, we assess with medium level of certainty that the threat\nactor has links to the East European region, Ukraine, Russia or Romania in particular.\n##### Modus Operandi\nThe key goal of CryptoCore’s heists is to gain access to cryptocurrency exchanges’ wallets, be it general\ncorporate wallets or wallets belonging to the exchange’s employees. For this kind of operation, the group\nbegins with an extensive reconnaissance phase against the company, its executives, officers and IT\npersonnel. While the group’s key infiltration vector to the exchange is usually through spear-phishing\nagainst the corporate network, the executives’ personal email accounts are the first to be targeted.\nInfiltrating the personal email accounts is an optional phase; however, it’s a matter of hours to weeks\nuntil the spear-phishing email is sent to a corporate email account of an exchange’s executive.\nThe spear-phishing is typically carried out by impersonating a high-ranking employee either from the\ntarget organization or from another organization (e.g. advisory board) with connections to the targeted\nemployee. After gaining initial foothold, the group’s primary objective is obtaining access to the victim’s\npassword manager account. This is where the keys of crypto-wallets and other valuable assets – which\nwill come handy in lateral movement stages – are stored. The group will remain undetected and\nmaintain persistence until the multi-factor authentication of the exchange wallets will be removed, and\nthen act immediately and responsively.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Cyber Kill Chain\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CryptoCore Group’s Main Characteristics \n\n  - Persistence and adherence to same general TTPs and targets – the group maintains the\nsame general course of action regarding the infection and post-exploitation stages. While the\nbait document type, the services the phishing sites mimic, the exact tooling and others may vary,\nan overarching strategy remains the same. Also, the group seems to be reluctant to let go of a\ntarget: in some cases that we have investigated, the group keeps attacking the same company\nover and over. The group also appears to steadily use the same titles for its bait documents and\neven some payloads.\n\n  - Use of Cloud services, particularly – but not limited to – Google Drive – the group often\nuses Google Drive as the storage for its files, specifically the baits. Sometimes, the phishing\nemails contain links claiming to be from Drive, while actually directing to a copycat site, and\nsometimes it uses the actual Drive service. Again, Drive is not the only service they use, it's just\ncommon.\n\n  - Use of malicious cryptocurrency-themed domains such as btcprime[.]tk, krypitalvc[.]com,\nblockchaintransparency[.]institute and the like.\n\n  - Use of bit.ly URL shortening service – the group uses this service widely for its\ncommunications, specifically to deploy scripts and files for further infection. The service has two\nmain advantages for the group's operators: first, it allows to mask a suspiciously looking link\nbehind a neutral bit.ly link; second, it provides the attacker with click statistics, which allow them\nto track the number of potential infections and their geographical spread.\n\n  - Use of LNK shortcuts as downloaders – we have seen the attackers hide LNK shortcuts behind\nicons and titles of other file types, mostly text files. Sometimes it could be a password file needed\nto open the main document, sometimes it could be the main document that is actually a\nshortcut, but LNK files are a staple for this group. These files are used to connect to the\ncommand and control (C2) server and download next-stage files.\n\n  - Use of Visual Basic Script (VBS) files – one distinct characteristic of the group is a relatively\nheavy use of VBS files both as downloaders and as backdoors. What appears to be the main\nbackdoor of the group is also a VBS file (tracked by Proofpoint Emerging Threats as\nCageyChameleon), rather than an executable or an in-memory payload. We are not sure why\nVBS, but we can assume that these files are deemed lighter and less prone to detections, as\nopposed to, say, EXE or DLL files. However, in singular cases we have seen the group\ndownloading and using the Mimikatz password-dumping tool as well, so VBS files are not the\nonly tools used in post-exploitation.\n\n  - Swiftness and responsiveness – the group's infrastructure is continuously and rapidly\nchanging. While in some cases we have seen the same infrastructures being constantly reused,\nperhaps against multiple victims, the group is generally quick to register and employ new\ndomains and links. In some cases, the freshly created bit.ly link is used immediately, on the same\nday; in one case, a new domain was registered, we have alerted the client, and within 30-40\nminutes their systems identified an attack from that new domain.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CryptoCore Infrastructure Insights:\n\n1) CryptoCore Working Time Zone\n\nIn attempt to better understand the origin of CryptoCore operators, we have collected the Whois\nregistration dates of C&C domains. After data cleaning, a plot of the distribution of Whois registration\nrecords showed no distinct time zone. As shown in the chart below, as for UTC+0, the operators do\nnot register their C&C domains in certain working hours.\n\nFigure 2: CryptoCore C&C Whois registration records by hour\n\n2) CryptoCore operators use dedicated IP addresses where they host their C&C domains. These IPs\n\nare associated with AS networks located in multiple countries, mainly the United States, Taiwan,\nBrazil, Egypt, Mongolia, and Thailand (in descending order).\n\n3) C&C TLD to Registrar & Nameserver Distribution\n\nCryptoCore group mostly registers dedicated C&C domains, using the .xyz TLD via NameCheap\nregistrar services. Moreover, the operators register all dedicated C&C domains that are associated\nwith the .info TLD via NameSilo registrar services. The hostname usually contains keywords that\nresemble names of cloud services (also through typo-squatting). They frequently use the known TLD\n.com, alongside gTLDs containing meaningful words to mislead the victims, such as .email, .services,\netc. In addition, it appears that the threat group prefers PublicDomainRegistry and NameSilo\nregistrars; however, these are not the only registrars used.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: CryptoCore C&C TLD Distribution\n\n4) Anomalous Registration of multiple C&C Domains in 3 Days\n\nUsually, CryptoCore operators do not register multiple C&C domains on the same day, except on\nspecial occasions. One company was targeted by CryptoCore in July 2018, two months before the\ngroup registered 10 domains within 3 days. This may indicate that the group's operators were aware\nthat their digital infrastructure has been discovered, so they have started quickly setting up new\ndigital infrastructure in a few days.\nIn addition, they tend to register a new C&C domain once or twice a month until this day.\n5) CryptoCore operators re-register expired C&C domains\n\nThis may suggest the attackers’ intent to reuse the infrastructure for different ongoing campaigns, as\nwell as future ones. In addition, it emphasizes that year-old domains are still in use, and hence\nshould be blocked for long periods.\n6) Use of DDNS services till 2019\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, CryptoCore operators had heavily relied on DDNS services such as dynu (dynu.com,\nkozow.com, theworkpc.com), ChangeIP (onmypc.org, itemdb.com, itsaol.com) and\nDNSExit/Netdorm (linkpc.net, publicvm.com). However, in 2020 we have observed an uptick in\nregistering new domains and pointing C&C domains to dedicated servers.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Infection Chain\n\nThe following diagram shows the general infection pattern of CryptoCore, as presented in a research\npublished independently by the Japanese CERT and dealing with CryptoCore's activity in Japan[5].\n\nFigure 4: CryptoCore's TTP outline as presented in JPCERT's research\n\n#### CryptoCore TTPs\n\nAs previously mentioned, the campaign begins with an extensive reconnaissance stage against the\ncompany, it’s executives, IT managers and key employees. Optionally, the group operators gain access to\nprivate email accounts of executives in the targeted cryptocurrency exchange. The next stage would be\nspear-phishing, typically impersonating a high-ranking employee, either from the target company itself\nor from a company that deals with the target. The email's quality is not consistent and can vary from\nalmost generic-looking phishing email with a shared link (see Figure 5), to a well-crafted email that is only\nslightly flawed (see Figure 6).\n\n5 blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: example of a simplistic phishing email by the group\n\nFigure 6: example of a spear-phishing email by the group, note the misplaced punctuation\n\nFigure 7: An href attribute leads to a bit.ly link instead of Google Drive\n\nWhile the link in the email states that its destination is Google Drive, it really leads to malicious landing\npage with a similarly-sounding name. The true link is served via an HTML href attribute, shortened with\nbit.ly, probably for analysis obstruction and statistics' collection as bit.ly allows its users to track the\nshortened link's clicks. In parallel, another bit.ly connection will be established, using an <img> HTML tag\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\nprobably containing the company's logo and the second bit.ly link. However, this tactic in not a\nconsistent characteristic of Crypto Core, as it has only been observed once until now – in most cases the\nlink will not hide behind another link but rather lead to the download.\n\nFigure 8: a code snippet with the link in the <img> tag\n\nClicking the link in the email will result in a compressed file being downloaded to the target computer.\nThis file will typically contain two additional files – a bait document (DOC, PDF or XLS) that is passwordprotected, and an LNK file disguised as a text file with the password (see Figure 9). However, in singular\ncases we have seen the password file being a text file indeed, while the password-protected bait initiated\nthe connection with the C2 server (see Figure 10)\n\nFigure 9: the LNK file\n\nFigure 10: the txt file\n\nUsually, the LNK file will present the target with a text file containing the password and at the same time\nit will also download a malicious VBS script, also through a bit.ly-shortened URL. At this point, the\ncampaigns slightly differ, specifically those presented in the JPCERT/CC report[6].\n\nIn the Japanese case, in addition to presenting the password, the LNK also creates and runs a VBS file in\n%TEMP%, and also lists the processes running on target computer, looking for specific strings: \"hudongf\"\nor \"qhsafe\", which are suspected to represent the \"zhudongfangyu.exe\" and \"qhsafemain.exe\" processes\nof the Quihoo360 security solutions suite. If those are absent, an LNK file, named \"xBoxOne.lnk\", will be\nadded to the Startup folder, making it run every time a user logs into the infected computer; if one of\nthose strings is present in the process list, no further action will be taken. The Japanese CERT was unable\n\n6 blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\nto confirm, as of June 2019, the LNK's ultimate purpose, however, given the fact that it sits in the Startup\nfolder, we assume it to give the attackers persistence on the target.\n\nAs for the VBS created in %TEMP%, it acts as a downloader for another VBS. That VBS collects the\nfollowing information:\n\n- Username\n\n- Host name\n\n- OS version, install date and run time\n\n- Time zone\n\n- CPU name\n\n- Execution path of the VBS in %TEMP%\n\n- Network adapter information\n\n- List of running processes\n\nThe information is sent to the C2 server every minute, and it expects additional VBS as a response. The\nJPCERT couldn't confirm the nature of this latter-stage payload.\n\nIn the cases observed by us, manual execution of the LNK file initiates the infection chain. While the user\nis presented with the password for the bait document, the compromised host performs a one-time\ncommunication with the C2 to download a VBS payload identified as VBS/CageyChameleon by\nProofpoint’s Emerging Threats service. This VBS collects the same information as the one mentioned in\nthe Japanese case, i.e. username, OS, time zone etc. The cases differ, then, in the intermediate stages\nbetween the \"password\" file's opening and the activation of the stage 2 payload – in the Japanese case\nthere are additional stages (e.g. the presence of oezjrjua.vbs), not seen by us.\n\nFigure 11: the second stage VBS payload identified as part of the campaign\n\nAs already mentioned, the group makes extensive use of the legitimate bit.ly shortening service in its\ncommunications. The service not only allows the attacker to hide their links behind innocuously looking\nshortcuts, but also provides them with click statistics. It’s worth the mention that those statistics used to\nbe publicly viewable, roughly until early 2020, but are currently open only to the links’ creators.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Statistics provided for the attacker through one of the links\n\nAs depicted in Figure 12, CryptoCore operators tend to use their bit.ly links to a limited number of highly\ntargeted victims originated in different countries. They reuse the same bit.ly links, using them\ncontinuously for 3-7 days, as seen in December 2019 and January 2020 (Figure 12).\n\nAnother characteristic of the group is communicating with the C2 server through the 8080 port with the\ntarget's unique identifier appended usually to an “id” parameter, or, rarely, to a “topic” parameter:\n\na. <C2 domain>:8080/edit?(<id or topic>)=<unique_identifier>\n\nb. <C2 domain>:8080/open?(<id or topic>)=<unique_identifier>\n\nc. <DDNS C2 subdomain>:8080/search.php\n\n#### CryptoCore in action: Case Study\n\nWe have presented out main understandings about the group, now we would like to demonstrate it in\naction, through one case that we have investigated this March.\n\nThat morning, we've notified one of our clients about freshly discovered CryptoCore indicators. The\nclient informed us, that roughly 30-40 minutes after we've sent the notification their systems identified\nan attack through the new infrastructure.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attack began with a phishing email impersonating the client's CEO and supposedly containing some\nnew instructions which should be distributed and acquainted with by the employees. The email was\nwritten in fairly good local language, but it was nevertheless imperfect and with odd punctuation. What's\nmore is that communications inside the company are conducted mostly in English, so however good was\nthe language used by the operators, it was still suspicious.\n\nAnalyzing the emails headers, we saw it being initially sent from a computer belonging to the Italian\nhosting company \"Aruba\". Moreover, the link written in the email was supposedly leading to Google\nSpreadsheets, while the <href> actually contained a bit.ly link and the Spreadsheets link was just a ruse.\nThe true link led to a page mimicking Google Drive and registered that same morning.\n\nFigure 13: The newly registered page being employed right away\n\nFor the second stage, another bit.ly link was used, leading to a page created in late February:\n\nFigure 14: Use of another bit.ly link that was created in late February\n\nDuring the attack, we suspect the group also employing Mimikatz for credentials harvesting.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nC) 2020 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd [info@clearskysec com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com) www clearskysec com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CryptoCore Digital Infrastructure - Graph\n\nThe following Maltego graph visualizes CryptoCore digital infrastructure, mainly dedicated IP addresses\nlinked to C&C domains via passive DNS.
