In just a short period of time, Prometheus\ncaused a lot of damage, and breached over 40 companies.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n**High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given the**\ndestructive potential of the attacks.\n**Human Operated Attack: Prior to the deployment of the ransomware, the attackers attempt to**\ninfiltrate and move laterally throughout the organization, carrying out a fully-developed attack\noperation.\n**Shared Builder: The Prometheus group, as well as other threat actors, used the Thanos builder to**\nbuild and customize their ransomware.\n**Group of REvil?: Prometheus ransomware branding themselves as part of the REvil group, probably**\nin an attempt to piggyback on the fame of one of the most infamous - and successful - ransomware\ngroups.\n**Detected and Prevented:** [The Cybereason Defense Platform fully detects and prevents the](https://www.cybereason.com/platform)\nPrometheus ransomware:\n\n_Cybereason Detects and Blocks Prometheus Ransomware_\n\n[Like other prominent ransomware groups, such as the DarkSide group, Prometheus follows the RaaS](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-darkside-ransomware)\nbusiness model and operates as a professional enterprise where it refers to its victims as “customers,” and\ncommunicates with them using a customer service ticketing system.\n\n[In addition, Prometheus follows the double extortion trend and hosts a leak site, where it has a “hall of](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/rise-of-double-extortion-shines-spotlight-on-ransomware-prevention)\nshame” for victims and posts stolen data for sale. The names of the victims are posted on the website even\nbefore the victims decide whether to pay or not, either under the status “waiting for the company decision” or\n“company paid, data is not for sale.”\n\nWhen it comes to the affected industries and regions, the group seems to attack almost indiscriminately.\nAccording to their website, the group claims to have breached over 40 organizations from different\nindustries/sectors. Among their victims observed were companies in the following industries: consulting, oil\nand gas, financial, media, governments, advertising, manufacturing, retail, food, hotels, manufacturing,\ninsurance, transportation, and medical services. The regions affected are South America, US, UK, MiddleEast, UAE, Asia and Europe.\n\nIt’s also interesting to note that some victims appear to be on the list more than once, but attacked in\ndifferent time periods. Since those victims had paid, it’s unclear at this point if it’s by mistake or that the\ngroup has attacked the same victim more than once before or even after paying.\n\n[A recent Cybereason report titled Ransomware: The True Cost to Business, found that 80% of organizations](https://www.cybereason.com/ebook-ransomware-the-true-cost-to-business)\nthat paid a ransom were hit by a second attack, and almost half of those were hit by the same threat group.\n\n### Group of REvil?\n\nUp until June 14th, the operators of Prometheus claimed to be part of the notorious REvil ransomware\ngroup, and even mentioned them in their logo. On June 15th, the group decided to delete the name of REvil\nfrom their logo, and remove any potential relation to the group.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is worth noting that there hasn t been strong or conclusive evidence of a real connection or collaboration\n[between the two groups and the assumption is that the Prometheus group was most likely just using the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/prometheus-ransomware/)\nname and reputation of REvil to increase the likelihood of ransom payments.\n\nAlthough it is unclear why the group has decided to remove the name of REvil from their logo, it’s interesting\nto look at the timing. The REvil group was just attributed to another major attack infecting potentially\nthousands of companies by way of an exploit against Kaseya VSA remote management service which\npropagated ransomware through the IT service provider’s Managed Services Provider network, and a recent\n[attack against the global food company JBS which drew attention to them from the US authorities.](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002819883/revil-a-notorious-ransomware-gang-was-behind-jbs-cyberattack-the-fbi-says)\n\nIn May, it was the [DarkSide group that made big headlines after attacking the Colonial Pipeline network,](https://www.cybereason.com/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY3liZXJlYXNvbi5jb20vYmxvZy9jeWJlcmVhc29uLXZzLWRhcmtzaWRlLXJhbnNvbXdhcmU%3D&ct=SEARCH&pid=3354902&cid=44194973264&t=ZGFya3NpZGU%3D&d=www.cybereason.com&c=2&c=6&rp=1&ab=false&opcid=&rs=UNKNOWN&hs-expires=1657129691&hs-version=1&hs-signature=APUk-v4w7sXWik9kxyVU_-9L7cJ5dXS_tw)\nwhich caused the US authorities to take actions that eventually led to the DarkSide group shutting down\ntheir operations (allegedly). Ransomware operators will usually try to evade such unwanted publicity\n[because of their fear of retaliation from law enforcement agencies.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/inside-the-darkside-ransomware-attack-on-colonial-pipeline)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Screenshots from the Prometheus leaks website_\n\n### From one Builder to Multiple Ransomware\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning of this blog post, Prometheus is not an entirely new ransomware. It is a\nvariant of the Thanos ransomware, which has been sold in underground forums since late 2019. The group\nbehind Prometheus, as well as other threat actors, bought Thanos and used the builder that comes with it to\ncustomize their ransomware:\n\n_[The builder used to configure Thanos. Credit: Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/thanos-ransomware-builder/)_\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the distinguishing changes observed include the extension that is added to the encrypted files and\nof course the ransom note content. Because of that, there are different variants of the Thanos ransomware\nout there, with most of them named after the extension that is appended to the encrypted files.\n\nThe following table presents some of the variants found in the wild:\n\n\n**Ransomware**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Ransom note** **Extension**\n\n\nThanos RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt .crypted\n\nrandom string\n\nHakbit HOW_TO_RECOVER_YOUR_FILES.txt .[ID-30BC8771].\n\n[black_private@tuta.io].CRYSTAL\n\n.VIPxxx\n\nAbarcy Abarcy#2996.txt .abarcy\n\nHard RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt .hard\n\nMilleni5000 RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt .secure\n\nRavack HELP_ME_RECOVER_MY_FILES.txt .ravack\n\nEnergy HOW_TO_DECYPHER_FILES.txt .energy[potentialenergy@mail.ru]\n\nAlumni HOW_TO_RECOVER_YOUR_FILES.txt .alumni\n\nPrometheus RESTORE_FILES_INFO.txt .[XXX-XXX-XXXX] format (unique per victim)\n\n.PROM[prometheushelp@mail[.]ch]\n\nXXXXXXXXXX[prometheusdec@yahoo[.]com]\n(unique per victim)\n\n### Prometheus Ransomware Analysis\n\nThe binary generated by the builder is an obfuscated .NET executable that consists of a main function that\nis responsible to decode base64 strings in memory and pass them to the other functions.\n\nAmong the functionality observed by the malware is the ability to enumerate processes and manipulate with\nthem, changing registry keys, setting persistence, downloading additional files, collecting information about\nthe machine and more:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The execution of the ransomware as shown in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\n### Setting Persistence\n\nPrometheus creates persistence by copying the file into the startup folder of the user. This ensures that the\nmalware will continue to run after logoff-login of the user:\n\n_Adding the ransomware binary to the startup folder_\n\n### Ensuring Successful File Encryption\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon execution, Prometheus performs a series of tasks to ensure that it will run smoothly without\ninterference.\n\nThese tasks include stopping common security tools and backup related processes, interacting with the\nregistry and scheduled task, deleting files, and interacting with services.\n\n**Deleting Raccine:**\n\nRaccine is a ransomware prevention tool that tries to stop ransomware from deleting shadow copies in\nWindows. Prometheus deletes the scheduled task and the registry keys of the software:\n\n_reg delete \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /V \"Raccine Tray\" /F_\n\n_reg delete

other ransomware, Prometheus deletes the shadow copies to prevent restoring backups of the machine\nafter encrypting files. To do so, it runs the following PowerShell command:\n\n_\"powershell.exe\" & Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object { $_Delete(); }_\n\n**Configuring Services**\n\n\n_sc.exe config SSDPSRV start=_\n_auto_\n\n\nEnables discovery of UPnP devices on your home network\n\n\n_sc.exe config Dnscache start= auto_ Caches DNS names and registers the full computer name for your\ncomputer\n\n_sc.exe config upnphost start= auto_ Allows UPnP devices to be hosted on your computer\n\n\n_sc.exe config FDResPub start=_\n_auto_\n\n\nPublishes your computer and resources attached to your computer\nso they can be discovered over the network\n\n\n-----\n\n_sc.exe config_\n_SQLTELEMETRY$ECWDB2 start=_\n_disabled_\n\n_sc.exe config SQLTELEMETRY_\n_start= disabled_\n\n_sc.exe config SQLWriter start=_\n_disabled_\n\n_sc.exe config SstpSvc start=_\n_disabled_\n\n### Spreading Across The Network\n\n\nSQL service, disabled to prevent backup and unlocking files\n\nSQL service, disabled to prevent backup and unlocking files\n\nSQL service, disabled to prevent backup and unlocking files\n\nPrevent users from being able to use SSTP (Secure Socket\nTunneling Protocol) to access remote servers\n\n\nOnce successfully executed, Prometheus will try to spread in the network using different methods. First, it\nwill “prepare the ground” by performing some reconnaissance commands that include running “Net view”\nand “arp -a”, followed by a ping sweep to check the connections and potential machines to infect.\n\n[Then it continues with changing local firewall rules, downloading Psexec/Paexec and in some cases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)\n[ProcessHider as well, and enabling SMB1 protocol - most likely to exploit a vulnerability for spreading using](https://github.com/M00nRise/ProcessHider)\nSMB, much like as [EternalBlue:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue)\n\n_netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\\\"Network Discovery\\\" new enable=Yes_\n\n_netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"File and Printer Sharing\" new enable=Yes_\n\n_powershell.exe & Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol_\n\nAfter that, the malware begins the spreading process. Initially it will try an easy way using the “Net use”\ncommand to try to copy itself into shared folders. Then it will run PsExec/PaExec remotely to execute the\nbinary. On other occasions it will try to exploit a SMB vulnerability to spread:\n\n_A VirusTotal graph showing the connection between Prometheus binaries and Psexec, Paexec and_\n_ProcessHider_\n\n### Encrypting The Files\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter ensuring successful execution of the malware and deleting backup files, Prometheus begins it s\nencryption routine. First, it will search for files matching extensions that were passed in build time. Those\nextensions vary from Microsoft Office files, images, scripts, archives, music, videos, and different database\nfiles:\n\n_Searching for DB files_\n\nThe builder also supports a “fast mode” of encryption where only a portion of each file is encrypted. When\nthis mode is enabled during build time, the ransomware encrypts a preconfigured amount of data from each\nfile and overwrites the file with the encrypted content. This technique saves Prometheus time and shortens\nthe entire encryption time, which can take just seconds up to a few minutes, depending on the number of\nfiles on the targeted machine.\n\nPrometheus appends a custom extension that is unique for every executable and in some variants even\ncontains the name of the victim:\n\n_Custom extension appended to the encrypted files_\n\nFinally, Prometheus drops a ransom note in .hta and text format, and presents the .hta file to the end user:\n\n\n-----\n\n_.hta file ransom note_\n\n_.txt file ransom note_\n\n## Cybereason Detection and Prevention\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware attacks are on the rise. A recently released report by Cybereason, titled Ransomware: The\n_True Cost to Business, detailed how malicious actors are fine-tuning their ransomware campaign tactics and_\nhow both the frequency and severity of successful ransomware attacks have tremendous impact on victim\norganizations and their ability to conduct business.\n\nThe [Cybereason Defense Platform is able to prevent the execution of the Prometheus Ransomware using](https://www.cybereason.com/platform)\nmulti-layer protection that detects and blocks ransomware with threat intelligence, machine learning, and\nnext-gen antivirus (NGAV) capabilities. Additionally, when the Anti-Ransomware feature is enabled,\nbehavioral detection techniques in the platform are able to detect and prevent any attempt to encrypt files\n[and automatically generates a MalopTM for it with the complete attack narrative:](https://www.cybereason.com/platform#malop)\n\n_Malop for Prometheus ransomware as shown in the Cybereason Defense Platform_\n\nUsing the Anti-Malware feature with the right configurations (listed in the recommendations below), the\nCybereason Defense Platform will also detect and prevent the execution of the ransomware and ensure that\nit cannot encrypt targeted files.
