Tuesday, July 20, 2021 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn [March and](https://community.rsa.com/t5/rsa-netwitness-platform-blog/exchange-exploit-case-study-cve-2020-0688/ba-p/517916) [November 2020, third-party researchers reported on a campaign where threat](https://www.digital14.com/insights/blogs/posts/2020/11/09/the-exploitation-of-cve-2020-0688-in-the-uae)\n[actors targeted organizations using CVE-2020-0688, a remote code execution vulnerability in](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2020-0688)\nMicrosoft Exchange Server. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers\nobserved a continuation of this activity through to at least April 2021, and potentially ongoing\nas of June 2021.\n\n## Discovering historic and current intrusion activity\n\nDuring a threat hunting engagement in April 2021, Secureworks incident responders\nidentified web shells on multiple hosts in a customer’s environment, as well as other\nevidence of post-exploitation activity. Subsequent analysis revealed a previous compromise\nof SharePoint servers within the environment, as well as ongoing activity initially facilitated by\nthe compromise of on-premises Exchange servers. CTU™ analysis indicates that the two\nsets of activity were unrelated and were conducted by different threat groups.\n\n### Historic compromise of SharePoint servers\n\nIn April 2019, a threat actor compromised several SharePoint servers in the customer's\n[environment by exploiting SharePoint remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2019-0604.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2019-0604)\nThis compromise led to the creation of multiple web shells, including simple China Chopper\nweb shells (see Figure 1). Some of these web shells used the same filename as their hardcoded parameter (e.g., t.aspx).\n\n_Figure 1. China Chopper web shells dropped onto compromised SharePoint servers._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCTU researchers previously linked the IP addresses and filenames used by the attackers to\nwidespread and opportunistic exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 in the April 2019 timeframe.\n[Third-party reporting linked some of the exploitation activity to the China-based BRONZE](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emissary-panda-attacks-middle-east-government-sharepoint-servers/)\nUNION threat group (also known as Emissary Panda and APT27).\n\nFrom June 2019 to June 2020, several C# web shells were installed on the same SharePoint\nservers, written to the same directories as the China Chopper web shells. These web shells\ntake a key and a Base64-encoded buffer as input, use the key to decrypt the buffer to a byte\n[array, and load the array into memory via the System.Reflection.Assembly.Load method (see](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.load)\nFigure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Formatted C# web shell that loads decoded data into memory. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nOther than being installed on the same compromised servers in the same locations, there is\nno evidence to link this second set of web shells to the earlier China Chopper deployment.\nBy June 2019, the SharePoint vulnerability was widely known and multiple threat actors were\nopportunistically exploiting it.\n\n### Ongoing campaign leveraging compromised Exchange Servers\n\nSecureworks incident responders discovered that a basic file upload and command\n[execution web shell (owafont.aspx) was installed on an Exchange Server within the](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/aspx/asp.net-backdoors/fileupload.aspx)\ncustomer's environment in late 2020. Initial access was likely achieved by exploiting CVE2020-0688. An attacker possessing valid user credentials can leverage this vulnerability to\nexecute arbitrary code. There is no evidence linking this activity to the 2019 SharePoint\ncompromise.\n\nIn early 2021, the same web shell was installed on other Exchange Servers within the\nenvironment, likely using the same compromised administrator account. CTU researchers\nidentified a hostname for the threat actor's system (WIN-P6LP3KP4SQ6) in associated\nWindows authentication events.\n\n\n-----\n\nApproximately three months later, the attacker re-entered the environment using the same\nhostname and the same compromised credentials to upload the TransportClient.dll web\n[shell. According to third-party analysis of this small C# web shell, it can execute commands](https://community.rsa.com/t5/rsa-netwitness-platform-blog/exchange-exploit-case-study-cve-2020-0688/ba-p/517916)\ndirectly via cmd.exe or can send commands to the 'splsvc' named pipe. CTU researchers\nobserved that the attacker used a Base64-encoded PowerShell script to create the named\npipe (see Figure 3). This script potentially leveraged open-source code available from\n[GitHub.](https://github.com/p3nt4/Invoke-Piper/blob/master/Invoke-Piper.psm1)\n\n_Figure 3. Extract of decoded PowerShell script that creates the splsvc named pipe. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nCTU researchers identified a second variant of this script in the environment as well. In\naddition to creating the named pipe, this variant creates a scheduled task called 'Google\nUpdater' (see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. Decoded PowerShell script that creates splsvc named pipe and 'Google Updater'_\n_scheduled task. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\nTransportClient.dll contains a PDB string (see Figure 5) that is also present in other identified\ncopies of the web shell. Elements in the string led CTU researchers to name this web shell\n'SheepTransportShell'.\n\n_Figure 5. PDB string in SheepTransportShell sample. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n[Figure 6 shows how the threat actor used the Appcmd.exe Internet Information Services (IIS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/getting-started-with-iis/getting-started-with-appcmdexe)\nutility to install SheepTransportShell. Multiple threat groups have used this technique,\n[including the Iranian COBALT LYCEUM threat group. Appcmd.exe could reportedly be used](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/lyceum-takes-center-stage-in-middle-east-campaign)\n[to install the RGDoor IIS backdoor used by COBALT LYCEUM and COBALT GYPSY.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/cobalt-gypsy)\nCOBALT GYPSY and COBALT LYCEUM are subsets of the threat group described in open\nsource as APT34.\n\n_Figure 6. Installing SheepTransportShell on host. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nBy investigating the combination of the hostname and the compromised accounts,\nSecureworks incident responders identified additional intrusion activity in the customer's\nenvironment. The attacker accessed a critical business server to deploy a web shell named\nservice.aspx. Service.aspx provides file upload, file download, and remote code execution\ncapabilities.\n\nA second web shell with a slightly different filename (services.aspx) was uploaded to the\nsame server. Services.aspx appears to borrow code (see Figure 7) from the HighShell and\nHyperShell web shells. These tools are associated with COBALT GYPSY but were posted\n[online in 2019 as part of the 'Lab Dookhtegan' leaks. As a result, they cannot be considered](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-hackers-oilrig-read-my-lips/)\nexclusive to this threat group.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Code overlap between services.aspx (top) and publicly available HighShell web_\n_[shell (bottom). (Source: Secureworks, GitHub)](https://github.com/misterch0c/APT34/blob/master/Webshells_and_Panel/HighShell/HighShell.aspx)_\n\nThe threat actor uploaded an s.aspx web shell to the same SharePoint servers that were\npreviously exploited in April 2019. This web shell has the same functionality as\nservices.aspx. The attacker then used PowerShell to modify the file metadata timestamps\n(see Figure 8) to match those of srchrss.aspx, a legitimate file that builds an RSS feed based\non a search query. This modification was likely an effort to make the web shell blend in with\nlegitimate files. The s.aspx and services.aspx web shells are nearly identical, suggesting that\nthe same threat actor deployed both of them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Modifying s.aspx web shell timestamps to match those of an existing legitimate file._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAs part of the same intrusion activity, the threat actor dumped and exfiltrated credentials from\nthe organization's certificate authority server and from a domain controller. After a dropped\nMimikatz credential harvester binary (6.exe) was blocked by antivirus software, the threat\nactor used native system tools. Ntdsutil.exe was used on the domain controller to dump the\ncredentials, which were then exfiltrated as a compressed file (a.zip) via one of the\ncompromised Exchange Servers.\n\nApproximately one week later, a threat actor exploited a different administrator account to\nview the C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Web Server Extensions\\\nsubdirectories for ASPX files. Endpoint telemetry captured the attacker viewing the file\ncontents of the t.aspx China Chopper web shell (see Figure 9). It is likely that these actions\nwere performed by the same threat actor, although CTU researchers do not have evidence\nto confirm this.\n\n_Figure 9. Threat actor viewing contents of a China Chopper web shell deployed in April 2019._\n_(Source: Secureworks)_\n\n## Attribution\n\nCTU analysis suggests that an Iranian threat group, possibly COBALT GYPSY, was\nresponsible for the activity that started with the compromise of the Exchange Servers:\n\nThe long-running nature of the intrusion ─ The emphasis on persistence, the multiple\nentry points, and the lengthy duration are typical of threat actors focused on espionage\nrather than on financial gain.\nThe nature of affected organizations ─ The targeting and activity observed by CTU\nresearchers and described in third-party reporting is consistent with Iranian threat\ngroups' objectives.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data ingress and egress technique ─ The threat actors used a subdomain of\n[pipedream, which is a service that provides webhook-like functionality. Iranian groups](https://pipedream.com/)\n[have previously used similar services. These services allow the attacker to return](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Operation-Quicksand.pdf)\ncustom responses to command and control (C2) traffic, and traffic to these services\nmay appear legitimate to network defenders.\nUse of web shells ─ The web shells are generic but are stylistically similar to those\npreviously associated with Iranian threat groups such as COBALT GYPSY. The use of\na malicious IIS module for the SheepTransportShell web shell is reminiscent of the\nRGDoor backdoor, which is linked to COBALT GYPSY and COBALT LYCEUM.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIranian threat groups continue to pose a significant threat. These and other threat actors\nactively search for vulnerabilities that they can weaponize. After gaining access to a\ncompromised network, they attempt to establish multiple entry points and steal legitimate\nuser credentials to maintain access even after vulnerabilities have been patched. In addition\nto patching, organizations must gain visibility on their endpoints, particularly internet-facing\nand business-critical servers. This visibility lets network defenders detect and rapidly\nrespond to network intrusions.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 1 can be used to detect activity related to this threat.\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\n7e63f43d61fa5ec8fbbafbe3dfc6d417 MD5 hash SheepTransportShell\nweb shell likely\nassociated with Iranian\nthreat actors\n\n\n25378e5370d63c0835a92cc53b400d3a82999b0b SHA1\nhash\n\n\nd4a9200bcc10945b92685298dcbcbee1b66fd0bd8\n74e9b2bdcc40654c3092404\n\n\nSHA256\nhash\n\n\nSheepTransportShell\nweb shell likely\nassociated with Iranian\nthreat actors\n\nSheepTransportShell\nweb shell likely\nassociated with Iranian\nthreat actors\n\n\nddb1eaf4b3b27f7c120a261d512d7d74 MD5 hash Mimikatz binary (6.exe)\nlikely associated with\nIranian threat actors\n\n\n-----\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\n\nfa2204f491844732a1942d07fd9f37c7cd4a7f4d SHA1\nhash\n\n\n1a80ccdb125d754ae4f7c84f168ba225fa161500e\n2012c6dbdfc2c3eb25d056a\n\n\nSHA256\nhash\n\n\nMimikatz binary (6.exe)\nlikely associated with\nIranian threat actors\n\nMimikatz binary (6.exe)\nlikely associated with\nIranian threat actors\n\n\nWIN-P6LP3KP4SQ6 Hostname Associated with likely\nIranian threat actor's\nsystem\n\nbd020bcf23a934d0651d13103af6daa6 MD5 hash Web shell with file\nupload and execute\ncapability\n(owafont.aspx) likely\nassociated with Iranian\nthreat actors\n\n\n6c7526ca14bf1f98f5181ce378fce50d9fdd530a SHA1\nhash\n\n\ne6c96d0a9da0ca2018e5e7c719ba04f1940a24999\n27cdfee3417091a96068833\n\n\nSHA256\nhash\n\n\nWeb shell with file\nupload and execute\ncapability\n(owafont.aspx) likely\nassociated with Iranian\nthreat actors\n\nWeb shell with file\nupload and execute\ncapability\n(owafont.aspx) likely\nassociated with Iranian\nthreat actors\n\n\ne10fbb596869b19accc16625e3e2166a MD5 hash Web shell with file\nupload and execute\ncapability (service.aspx)\nlikely associated with\nIranian threat actors\n\n\n9df006e1896d426469993b60d22079a5d5c93c69 SHA1\nhash\n\n\nfd4a8684392664d180751246c088142be4d2bec8d\n77d4fedd5f18c480a938c90\n\n\nSHA256\nhash\n\n\nWeb shell with file\nupload and execute\ncapability (service.aspx)\nlikely associated with\nIranian threat actors\n\nWeb shell with file\nupload and execute\ncapability (service.aspx)\nlikely associated with\nIranian threat actors\n\n\n-----\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\n4bd64522dd13357b705b7456a5b4c473 MD5 hash Web shell similar to\nCOBALT GYPSY web\nshells (services.aspx)\nlikely associated with\nIranian threat actors\n\n\n0ce91e5fa9268007a1d409744916d16217ba7869 SHA1\nhash\n\n\n84ac4199817b3944c9970862826523703d54c156f\na10c5bd9fce2640e74ed003\n\nMozilla/5.0 (X11;
