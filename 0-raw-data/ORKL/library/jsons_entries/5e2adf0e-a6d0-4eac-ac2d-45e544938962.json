This serves the dual purpose of also signaling to NATO nations that\nRussia is unwilling to accept the further encroachment of NATO nations on its borders, especially\nUkraine and Georgia.\n\n   - The false flag defacement attacks on Ukrainian websites were tied to Belarusian entities but with\nbenefits to Russian strategic objectives.\n\n   - The Kremlin remains a dangerous source of global geo-cyber instability precisely because of its\nwillingness, at times, to deviate from formal doctrine to improvisation when engaging in direct\nmilitary action—Russia has accelerated the weaponization of confusion and provocation to create\na multi-state standoff centered around Ukraine, to thwart NATO expansionary pressures.\n\n### Russia Accelerates Aggression Towards Ukraine\n\nThe Kremlin is a complex actor within both the geopolitical and cyber domains. Since the 2014 Maidan\n\nrevolution which led to the fall of the Ukrainian government of Victor Yanukovych and resulted in the Russian\n\nmilitary invasion of Crimea, Russia has accelerated military force, influence operations, and cyber capabilities\n\ntowards Ukraine. Yet rather than directly engage in military invasion, Russia has leveraged elements of “active\n\nmeasures”–subterfuge, indirect action, and cyber campaigns–complicating analysis and clouding insight. In\n\nthis article, we explore and clarify the last few weeks of activity within Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan,\n\nlooking at three domains: diplomatic and military actions, cyber offensive actions, and traditional espionage.\n\nStarting March 2021 and surging late last year, Russia has accelerated regional tensions through a\n\nseries of aggressive actions mainly directed against Ukraine. At present, Russia has marshaled approximately\n\n[100,000 troops and support units near the Ukraine border, representing around 35% of its total battle groups.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/07/world/europe/ukraine-maps.html)\n\n[The troop surge has drawn considerable consternation from NATO members, which has placed its own troops](https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article235806816/Russland-Ukraine-Konflikt-Nato-versetzt-Krisenkraefte-in-erhoehte-Einsatzbereitschaft.html)\n\n[on increased operational alert.](https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article235806816/Russland-Ukraine-Konflikt-Nato-versetzt-Krisenkraefte-in-erhoehte-Einsatzbereitschaft.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Some European countries, like Germany and the UK, have publicly denounced Russian actions and warned](https://www.reuters.com/world/blinken-german-minister-reiterate-warning-russia-over-ukraine-2022-01-05/)\n\nof serious consequences for Russia should an invasion against Ukraine take place. During a press briefing on\n\n[November 15, 2021, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned of a “significant, large Russian military](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_188552.htm)\n\nbuild-up, along the Russian/Ukrainian border”, and noted that NATO is monitoring the situation. On November\n\n20, 2021, Ukraine’s defense intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov stated that Russia “is preparing for an attack\n\nby the end of January or beginning of February”. The United States has supported NATO allies, reportedly\n\n[negotiating with Germany to halt the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, and](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-07/u-s-wants-nord-stream-2-halted-if-putin-were-to-invade-ukraine)\n\n[also weighing the removal of Russia from the SWIFT banking system in a sanctions package. Russian President](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/west-could-cut-russia-swift-sanction-nord-stream-latvia-says-2021-12-07/)\n\nVladimir Putin responded on December 9, calling the ongoing conflict in Donbas a “genocide” during a meeting\n\nof the Presidential Human Rights Council.1 Still, the United States and the United Kingdom have stated they\n\n[will not be deploying troops to Ukraine. On January 22, 2022, the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary issued a](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59712020)\n\n[statement stating that it has information that Russian intends to install a pro-Russian leader for Ukraine as it](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/kremlin-plan-to-install-pro-russian-leadership-in-ukraine-exposed)\n\nconsiders invasion. According to the statement, the former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev is being considered\n\nas a potential candidate. Additionally, the statement claims, “We have information that the Russian intelligence\n\nservices maintain links with numerous former Ukrainian politicians including:\n\n   - Serhiy Arbuzov, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine from 2012-2014, and acting Prime Minister\n\nin 2014\n\n   - Andriy Kluyev, First Deputy Prime Minister from 2010-2012 and Chief of Staff to former Ukrainian\n\nPresident Yanukovich\n\n   - Vladimir Sivkovich, former Deputy Head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council\n\n(RNBO)\n\n   - Mykola Azarov, Prime Minister of Ukraine from 2010-2014”\n\n### Russian Espionage May Enable Pretext for Ukraine Invasion\n\nAdding to the regional chaos, increasing Russian government espionage, planned sabotage, and\n\ninformation operations can act as a force multiplier for any pretext for war.\n\n[• In October 2021, NATO expelled Russian diplomats in Brussels due to alleged espionage activities,](https://euobserver.com/world/154016)\n\nand Russia responded by closing its entire NATO embassy.\n\n[• On December 2, 2021, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) announced the arrest of “3](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/02/russia-says-arrests-ukrainian-spy-trio-amid-high-tensions-a75717)\n\n[Ukrainian spies” who were purportedly plotting acts of terrorism.](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/02/russia-says-arrests-ukrainian-spy-trio-amid-high-tensions-a75717)\n\n   - Recorded Future’s Insikt Group tracked a viral claim posted on Russian social media website\n\n[Odnoklassniki in December 2021 claiming that Ukrainian soldiers, allegedly “left without food” are](https://ok.ru/vladiglorius/album/814789302751/853506727135)\nstealing livestock from residents in Donbas.\n\n   - On December 14, 2021, the Russian Mission to the United Nations (UN) denounced a Ukrainian\n\n“water blockade” on the Crimean Peninsula, claiming that this behavior has limited Crimeans’\naccess to safe and sanitary drinking water.\n\n   - On December 21, Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu, stated that a US private military\n\n[company is preparing a provocative action using an unidentified chemical weapon which was](https://www.rt.com/russia/543861-us-pmc-chemical-provocation-ukraine/)\nallegedly delivered to Avdiivka and Krasnyi Lyman, Donbas.\n\n   - On Monday, January 10, 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced, that it had\n\n[detained an alleged Russian military intelligence agent, stating that the individual was in process](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-zatrymala-ahenta-rosiiskykh-spetssluzhb-yakyi-splanuvav-nyzku-teraktiv-v-odesi-video%C2%A0)\nof planning a series of terror attacks near the port of Odessa.\n\n[• Subsequently on January 14, 2022, US officials accused Russia of sending saboteurs into eastern](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/us/politics/russia-ukraine-us-intelligence.html)\n\n[Ukraine in order to create pretext for an invasion.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/us/politics/russia-ukraine-us-intelligence.html)\n\nWhile giving plausible deniability to Russian officials, these claims and subversive acts work together to\n\nfoment domestic distrust of Ukraine and potentially set the stage for further action. What is less deniable are\n\nthe measures that Russian military forces are preparing for action, including publicizing a video on November\n\n[29, 2021, showing a RS-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) being loaded into a silo at the 28th](https://function.mil.ru/news_page/country/more.htm?id=12396159@egNews)\n\nGuards Missile Division Kozelsk Missile Base in Kaluga Oblast.\n\n1 http://en kremlin ru/events/president/news/67331\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ukrainian Government Websites Defaced, and Suffers Additional Destructive Cyber Attack\n\nIn apparent coordination with Russian diplomatic and military aggressions, cyber activity against Ukraine\n\nhas increased in recent days, including a false flag defacement and destructive attack against Ukrainian\n\norganizations. On the night between January 13 and January 14 2021, threat actors defaced the websites of\n\nthe Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Defense, the State\n\n[Emergency Service, the website for the Cabinet of Ministers, and others. According to The Record, all website](https://therecord.media/hackers-deface-ukrainian-government-websites/)\n\ndata was wiped and a message was posted stating the following: “Ukrainian! All your personal data has been\n\nsent to a public network. All data on your computer is destroyed and cannot be recovered. All information\n\nabout you stab (public, fairy tale and wait for the worst. It is for you for your past, the future and the future.\n\nFor Volhynia, OUN UPA, Galicia, Poland and historical areas”.\n\nUkrainian officials attributed the attack to Belarusian intelligence. On January 14, 2022, Ukrainian CERT\n\nissued a [statement regarding the attack, and noted in addition to the website defacement, there was a](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-ukraine-suspects-group-linked-belarus-intelligence-over-cyberattack-2022-01-15/)\n\ncoinciding destructive wiper and corrupter attack on Ukrainian networks. Ukrainian CERT described preliminary\n\nanalysis that determined the likely attack vector for the website defacement was a known vulnerability in\n\n[the October CMS web content management platform, CVE-2021-32648. Though the scope of the Ukrainian](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32648)\n\nCERT analysis focused on the October CMS, Ukrainian SBU analysis shows this may have been one part of\n\na wider attack against a hosting provider. The defacement included a message as an image file and was\n\nposted in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish languages, and included metadata with the following coordinates:\n\nLatitude: 52° 12’ 31.1’’ N, Longitude: 21° 0’ 33.9’’ E, GPS position: 52.208630, 21.009427, which is the parking\n\n[lot of the Warsaw School of Economics. As noted by the Polish Ministry of Defense CSIRT, the image used in](https://csirt-mon.wp.mil.pl/pl/articles6-aktualnosci/analiza-cyberataku-na-ukrainskie-zasoby-rzadowe/)\n\nthe defacements is not a photograph, so the image metadata was likely added manually. Additionally, open\n\n[source commentators noted errors in the Polish language text, with the Polish government issuing a statement](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59992531)\n\nsuggesting that the content was likely not written by a native Polish speaker.\n\nUkrainian authorities attributed the website defacement attack to [UNC1151, a threat activity group](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\n\nlinked by Mandiant to the Belarusian government, and which has also been associated with the Ghostwriter\n\ncampaign. Previous attacks in this campaign have [targeted Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland with “narratives](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/ghostwriter-influence-campaign)\n\ncritical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) presence in Eastern Europe”. In September 2021,\n\n[UNC1151 was blamed for temporarily disrupting the websites belonging to the authority managing Germany’s](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/german-election-authority-confirms-likely-cyber-attack)\n\nGeneral Election. UNC1151 appears to leverage credential harvesting as an initial entry vector. While some\n\n[early speculation placed blame directly on Russian entities, when Ukraine blamed UNC1151 many news outlets](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59992531)\n\nreported on the ties to Belarus. As noted above, previous reporting did tentatively tie UNC1151 to Belarus,\n\n[though Germany maintains likely Russian involvement with UNC1151. Attribution has interesting implications](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/newsroom/regierungspressekonferenz/2480282#content_4)\n\nhere. If Belarus is behind the activity targeting Ukraine, Silverado Policy Accelerator founder Dmitri Alperovitch\n\npoints out this may indicate Belarus has decided to support a potential Russian campaign against Ukraine.\n\nFurther investigation is needed to conclusively identify the culpable actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Stages of WhisperGate malware (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nIn addition to the website defacement, a destructive wiper attack posing as ransomware targeted\n\n[Ukrainian organizations. On January 15, Microsoft published a blog covering the destructive malware, which](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)\n\nthey named WhisperGate and attributed to DEV-0586, an as-of-yet unattributed threat actor. Microsoft stated\n\nthis attack spanned ”multiple government, non-profit, and information technology organizations, all based in\n\nUkraine”, indicating broader targeting than the government website defacement. As described by Microsoft,\n\nWhisperGate malware uses three stages, functionally named stage1[.]exe, stage2[.]exe, and a third stage\n\ndownloaded from a Discord server as a .jpg file. On Sunday, January 16, Microsoft submitted the files into file\n\nanalyzer service VirusTotal. The malware overwrites a hard disk’s Master Boot Record (MBR) with no recovery\n\noption, corrupts a number of files based on file extension, and displays a fake ransom message (in that no\n\nransom can actually be paid to recover the files) requesting payment of $10,000 USD to a Bitcoin address,\n\n1AVNM68gj6PGPFcJuftKATa4WLnzg8fpfv. Microsoft noted this Bitcoin wallet address is consistent across\n\nall DEV-0586 intrusions and appears to only have a single small transfer on January 14.\n\n### Other Russian-Nexus Cyber Activity Occurring\n\nInterestingly, the Ukraine defacement activity is not the only recently observed activity with a potential\n\nRussian nexus. Google Threat Analysis Group detected ongoing APT28-related credential phishing campaigns\n\ntargeting Ukraine, which appears to be independent from the website defacements. Domains reported are:\n\n   - consumerpanel.eu3[.]biz\n\n   - consumerpanel.eu3[.]org\n\n   - consumerspanelsrv.eu3[.]org\n\n   - protectpanel.eu3[.]biz\n\n   - updateservicecenter.blogspot[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nMeanwhile Russian-affiliated ransomware actors continue to operate, albeit with an apparent nod towards\n\nconsequences. On January 14, 2022, Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) raided and [shut down the](https://therecord.media/fsb-raids-revil-ransomware-gang-members/)\n\n[operations of the REvil ransomware gang. According to news reports, raids were conducted at 25 residences](https://therecord.media/fsb-raids-revil-ransomware-gang-members/)\n\nowned by 14 members suspected to be part of the REvil team across Moscow, St. Petersburg, and the\n\nLeningrad Oblast and Lipetsk Oblast regions. Subsequent to the arrests, the Biden administration says\n\n[one of the arrested members was responsible for the May 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack. Analysts tracking](https://therecord.media/biden-official-one-of-arrested-russian-hackers-carried-out-the-colonial-pipeline-attack/)\n\n[ransomware gang conversations on closed forums have stated that actors believe “this arrest was a publicity](https://www.advintel.io/post/storm-in-safe-haven-takeaways-from-russian-authorities-takedown-of-revil)\n\n[operation aimed at a formal public demonstration of Russia’s political intent to cooperate” with United States-](https://www.advintel.io/post/storm-in-safe-haven-takeaways-from-russian-authorities-takedown-of-revil)\n\nled negotiations.

Ransomware is not only a US-problem,\n\nas entities globally, across all industry verticals have been impacted. According to the Risky Business\n\nNewsletter, “Chinese organizations are [routinely being compromised by ransomware”, and the bulk of this](https://srslyriskybiz.substack.com/p/srsly-risky-biz-thursday-january-39c)\n\nactivity is attributed to Russian-speaking criminal actors. “Chinese security vendors attribute these attacks\n\nto a lot of familiar names. Sodinokibi and GandCrab, both associated with REvil, top the list.” And Russian law\n\nenforcement isn’t the only agency targeting ransomware gangs–Ukrainian law enforcement is also continuing\n\nto crack down on ransomware activity. Earlier in the week of January 14, 2022, Ukrainian authorities detained\n\n[five members of a ransomware gang that carried out attacks on more than 50 companies across Europe and](https://therecord.media/ransomware-gang-behind-attacks-on-50-companies-arrested-in-ukraine/)\n\nthe Americas. Since the start of 2021, Ukrainian authorities have arrested members of the Egregor, Cl0p,\n\nREvil, LockerGoga, and MegaCortex ransomware gangs.\n\n### Kazakhstan Uprising, Invites Russia, Others To Send Troops\n\nRussia’s focus on addressing NATO expansion has been further complicated by the January 2022 protests\n\nacross Kazakhstan. Battling countrywide protests, the government and security forces of Kazakhstan shut\n\ndown the internet and communications, increased rhetoric and [violence against protesters, and formally](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/01/07/kazakhstan-russia-protests-csto/)\n\nrequested assistance from Russia-aligned nations.

When viewed globally, Russia is a country with a GDP roughly equivalent to Canada, about one third\n\nof Germany’s GDP, and due to its reliance on exports of oil and gas is prone to market fluctuations. Russia’s\n\nlackluster response to the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated domestic instability and even resulted in\n\n[violence relating to pandemic public health restrictions, as was the case when a former SVR officer opened](https://meduza.io/feature/2021/12/07/v-moskve-posetitel-mfts-otkazalsya-nadet-masku-i-otkryl-strelbu-pogibli-dva-cheloveka)\n\n[fire in Moscow after being asked to don a mask, killing 2.

In October 2021, the Kremlin declared Navalny and his organization [as](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-navalny-says-his-prison-status-changed-terrorist-2021-10-11/)\n\n[terrorists and extremists, a designation coming the same week Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov was awarded](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-navalny-says-his-prison-status-changed-terrorist-2021-10-11/)\n\nthe Nobel Peace Prize for reporting on government corruption and human rights violations in Russia. Russian\n\nauthorities have engaged in a number of efforts to label prominent independent journalistic outlets and other\n\n“undesirable” organizations as “foreign agents”, effectively blocking them from operating or receiving funding\n\nin Russia. These organizations pose a threat to prevailing Kremlin narratives, some of which seek to reframe\n\n[the recent past.

The Kremlin has a clear interest to build stronger allegiances\n\n[with former Soviet states as a strategic hedge to NATO, notably joint exercises between CSTO members and](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-china-hold-large-scale-joint-military-drills-2021-08-10/)\n\nChina. While enjoying close ties historically, the relationship between Belarus and Russia has not always been\n\nsmooth, with Belarus at times courting European interests as well as Russian - a marked shift has occurred\n\nsince the contested 2021 Belarusian elections, however, with Belarus more closely aligned to Russia than\n\nin previous years. 2021 saw the largest Russian joint military exercise since 2012 occurring in Belarus in the\n\nform of the Zapad (West) 2021 exercises, with Russian and Belarusian forces executing a defense against\n\n[a simulated NATO incursion–and the two nations are starting new military exercises in February. There are](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-belarus-plan-joint-military-drills-february-lukashenko-2022-01-17/)\n\nadditional insights to draw from the Zapad 2021 joint military exercise with Belarus, most notably a shift\n\n[in Russian strategy to preserving the military force and an emphasis on strategic targets versus sustained](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/09/23/zapad-2021-what-we-learned-from-russias-massive-military-drills-a75127)\n\n[combat. As noted Russian scholar Michael Kofman states, “The clearest shift in Russian thinking is away from](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/09/23/zapad-2021-what-we-learned-from-russias-massive-military-drills-a75127)\n\nstrategic ground offensives and towards long-range strikes against critically important economic and military\n\ntargets, seeking to degrade a state’s ability or will to sustain a conflict”. The shift to strategic targeting to\n\ndegrade a state’s will to sustain a conflict highlights recent efforts by the Kremlin to engage Ukraine on cyber\n\nand information domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther complicating issues are the internal politics of Putin’s empire. Political opportunists and oligarchs\n\nwho seek favor with the Kremlin hold incredible power, and may come to play in a Ukrainian invasion. Political\n\n[opportunists hold power despite never being elected, such as Vladislav Surkov. In a 2014 interview, Vladislav](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/hidden-author-putinism-russia-vladislav-surkov/382489/)\n\nSurkov described himself as, “…the author, or one of the authors, of the new Russian system.” Surkov is the\n\nformer Russian Deputy Chairman and personal advisor to Putin. Though no longer holding official office,\n\nSurkov stage-led the Kremlin annexation of Crimea and ongoing conflict eastern Ukraine from 2014. While\n\n[never elected, Surkov was known as Putin’s “Grey Cardinal”, and though officially dismissed from his post in](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51553732)\n\n[2020, he has continued to influence and promote the Kremlin’s agenda, even recently stating, “An overdose](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/interview-an-overdose-of-freedom-is-lethal-to-a-state-says-former-key-putin-adviser-1.4598641)\n\n[of freedom is lethal to a state.” On the business side are players like Yevgeny Prigozhin, once called “Putin’s](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/interview-an-overdose-of-freedom-is-lethal-to-a-state-says-former-key-putin-adviser-1.4598641)\n\n[Chef” for his catering and restaurant businesses used by the Kremlin for state dinners. Prigozhin’s businesses](https://apnews.com/article/7f9e63cb14a54dfa9148b6430d89e873)\n\nextend from a $3 billion-a-year Kremlin contract for food services to Russian government institutions, to\n\ngovernment-backed disinformation campaigns such as the [2016 US election interference campaigns, and](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html)\n\nparamilitary operations conducted by the [Wagner Group, an unincorporated private military company with](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-slaps-sanctions-on-8-linked-to-russias-wagner-group/1912057)\n\nlinks to the Russian Ministry of Defense and a history of clandestine operations in Eastern Ukraine, Syria and\n\n[several African countries. The Wagner Group has been linked to the Russian-backed mercenaries operating](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/07/08/putin-s-not-so-secret-mercenaries-patronage-geopolitics-and-wagner-group-pub-79442)\n\n[in eastern Ukraine. These opportunists serve to muddy the waters of Russian influence and may come into](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/07/08/putin-s-not-so-secret-mercenaries-patronage-geopolitics-and-wagner-group-pub-79442)\n\nplay in a Ukraine invasion.\n\nEmploying cyber elements and information campaigns in advance of [or “in place of”] kinetic actions\n\nhelps the Kremlin maintain deniability and add unpredictability to the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Adding to\n\nthis confusion are the lack of consensus around Russian actions and strategies such as hybrid warfare. In\n\nthe 2014 Crimean annexation which occurred in the shadow of the Maidan revolution, some commentators\n\nstated relatively few hybrid elements were present; [RAND Corporation notes, “The Russian information](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1498/RAND_RR1498.pdf)\n\ncampaign accompanying its military movements was no more than a minor contributor to what proved\n\nto be a conventional takeover”. Yet the US Army War College noted a number of [cyber and information](https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2931&context=parameters)\n\n[warfare elements in the invasion of Crimea, including that, “cyberattacks against Crimea shut down the](https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2931&context=parameters)\n\ntelecommunications infrastructure, disabled major Ukrainian websites, and jammed the mobile phones of\n\nkey Ukrainian officials before Russian forces entered the peninsula.” While some Russian military offensives\n\nin Ukraine look less contrived than improvised, Russian views warfare is conducted on all strategic fronts\n\navailable, military advances coordinated with non-official government organizations such as mercenary forces\n\nand disinformation campaigns leading and preparing the way. Yet this coordination can vary in both execution\n\nand results–a [“Gerasimov doctrine” this is not, and in the Kremlin view, hybrid warfare is spearheaded by](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/05/im-sorry-for-creating-the-gerasimov-doctrine/)\n\n[Western governments and reflective of their doctrine. As stated by NATO in November 2021, “To [Russia],](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/11/12/inside-out-what-changing-russian-domestic-politics-mean-for-nato/index.html)\n\nhybrid warfare – gibridnaya voina – is something NATO uses against Russia, not vice versa”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis hybrid element–where loosely coordinated or official independent organizations operate–makes\n\nthe current atmosphere particularly dangerous. Russia appears to aim to thwart attempts to incorporate\n\nUkraine further into the European sphere of influence, both economically and militarily. Historically, Ukraine\n\nserved as a buffer zone between the powers, such as in 1991, when a newly independent Ukraine became\n\nthe third largest nuclear power in the world, whose weapons were inherited from the former Soviet Union. So\n\nthat Ukraine would relinquish its nuclear weapons, the US, the UK, and Russia promised to protect Ukraine’s\n\n[territorial integrity, through the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. That treaty has now been repeatedly violated](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/12/05/why-care-about-ukraine-and-the-budapest-memorandum/)\n\n[by the Kremlin, as have subsequent agreements such as the Minsk Protocol aiming for cessation of fighting](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/UA_150212_MinskAgreement_en.pdf)\n\nin eastern Ukraine. While signatories to the Memorandum are not obligated to use military means to enforce\n\nthe Memorandum, for its part, the US and other nations have not upheld their end of the bargain by defending\n\nthe territorial integrity of Ukraine, either. The use of non-attributed attacks, such as cyber attacks, or armed\n\nproxies helps in perpetuating the Kremlin narrative of appeasement though. Even in the ongoing conflict in\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk oblasts, Russia has mainly relied on proxies rather than to commit troops–only when\n\nthose proxies were on the verge of failing did Russian forces beat back Ukrainian advances. And while it\n\nappears Belarus acting as a proxy for Russia is behind the Ukrainian website defacement, unattributed actors\n\nconducted a companion destructive attack. Additionally, Recorded Future and others have noted infrastructure\n\nassociated with APT28, APT29, and NOBELIUM created recently, likely indicates future use. Whether directly\n\ncontrolled or influenced, Russia has demonstrated capability and willingness to conduct extraordinary cyber\n\nattacks, as witnessed by the SolarWinds software supply chain attack. Even the use of law enforcement to\n\ntakedown cyber actors comes into the equation, as the FSB arrests of remnants of the REvil ransomware gang\n\npossibly demonstrates attempts to appease the United States and Western nations.\n\nRussia remains a dangerous source of global geo-cyber instability precisely because of its willingness\n\nto eschew formal agreements and engage in non-linear warfare—the Kremlin weaponizes confusion and\n\nprovocation to create a multi-state standoff in eastern Ukraine. Yet Russia also possesses a high tolerance\n\nin the cyber realm for collateral damage, as shown by the NotPetya campaign in 2017 and the SolarWinds\n\nattack in 2020. With the news of the recent attacks by UNC1151, a group with a likely Belarus-nexus, we can\n\nreasonably conclude that Russia is permissive to encouraging other state-sponsored cyber actors to pursue\n\ntargeting, and furthering its strategic goals.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe Russian military buildup on the Ukrainian border continues to be a risk to regional stability in eastern\n\n[Europe. A recent article in The Record highlights what a possible Russia invasion might look like, predicting](https://therecord.media/what-would-russias-big-attack-on-ukraine-look-like/)\n\ninitial information operations before “a series of air- and missile- strikes”, amphibious landings at “key cities\n\nof Odessa, Kherson, and Mykolaiv”, a possible offense from the east and from the southeast rushing “towards\n\n[the key cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhia”. The United States has issued a travel advisory for Ukraine as “Level](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ukraine-travel-advisory.html)\n\n4: Do Not Travel” due to COVID-19 and increased threats from Russia. If your organization has personnel in\n\nUkraine, we recommend monitoring ongoing activity through open source intelligence and ensuring up-to\ndate evacuation procedures and exfiltration in the event of an invasion.\n\nWithin the digital space, all organizations should monitor infrastructure against known tactics, techniques,\n\nand procedures (TTPs) of Russian state-affiliated actors such as APT28 or NOBELIUM. Russia and its proxies\n\nhave previously shown little regard for limiting the scope of cyber operations, and may well consider Western\n\nEuropean and United States businesses as fair game for disruptive cyber attacks in order to reduce appetite\n\nfor NATO responses to Russia aggression.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A: Public resources\n\nFSB arrests of REvil\n\n   - https://therecord.media/fsb-raids-revil-ransomware-gang-members/\n\nBiden administration says arrested REvil actor was responsible for Colonial Pipeline\n\n   - https://therecord.media/biden-official-one-of-arrested-russian-hackers-carried-out-the-colonial\npipeline-attack/\n\nMicrosoft Security technical blog on WhisperGate malware\n\n   - https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian\norganizations/\n\n      - VirusTotal files for Stage1[.]exe – https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/\n\na196c6b8ffcb97ffb276d04f354696e2391311db3841ae16c8c9f56f36a38e92\n\n      - VirusTotal file for Stage2[.]exe – https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/\n\ndcbbae5a1c61dbbbb7dcd6dc5dd1eb1169f5329958d38b58c3fd9384081c9b78\n\nMandiant reporting on Ghostwriter\n\n   - https://www.mandiant.com/resources/ghostwriter-influence-campaign\n\n   - https://www.mandiant.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter\ninfluence-activity\n\n   - https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest provider of intelligence for enterprise security.
