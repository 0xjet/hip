The attack came just hours after a series of\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) onslaughts knocked several important websites in the\ncountry offline.\n\nBreaking. [#ESETResearch discovered a new data wiper malware used in Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESETResearch?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\ntoday. ESET telemetry shows that it was installed on hundreds of machines in the\ncountry. This follows the DDoS attacks against several Ukrainian websites earlier\ntoday 1/n\n\n— ESET research (@ESETresearch) [February 23, 2022](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581903205511181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[Detected by ESET products as Win32/KillDisk.NCV, the data wiper was first spotted just](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1bc44eef75779e3ca1eefb8ff5a64807dbc942b1e4a2672d77b9f6928d292591/detection)\nbefore 5 p.m. local time (3 p.m. UTC) on Wednesday. The wiper’s timestamp, meanwhile,\nshows that it was compiled on December 28, 2021, suggesting that the attack may haveth\nbeen in the works for some time.\n\nHermeticWiper misused legitimate drivers of popular disk management software. “The\nwiper abuses legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software in order to\ncorrupt data,” according to ESET researchers.\n\nAdditionally, the attackers used a genuine code-signing certificate issued to a Cyprus-based\ncompany called Hermetica Digital Ltd., hence the wiper’s name.\n\nIt also appears that at least in one case, the threat actors had access to a victim’s network\nbefore unleashing the malware.\n\n_READ ALSO:_ _[IsaacWiper and HermeticWizard: New wiper and worm targeting Ukraine](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)_\n[Earlier on Wednesday, a number of Ukrainian websites were knocked offline in a fresh](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60500618)\nwave of DDoS attacks that have been targeting the country for weeks now.\n\n[In the middle of January, another data wiper swept through Ukraine.
