The usual modus operandi involves appealing to the recipient’s desire to avoid incurring a\ndebt, especially where a business may be involved.\n\nFortiGuard Labs recently came across an interesting phishing e-mail masquerading as a purchase order\naddressed to a Ukrainian manufacturing organization that deals with raw materials and chemicals. The email contained a PowerPoint attachment that is in reality a sophisticated, multi-stage effort to deploy the\nAgent Tesla RAT (Remote Access Trojan).\n\nWhat makes this campaign unique is the usage of PPAM, which is a file format that is not very common. A\nPPAM is a Microsoft PowerPoint add-in that gives developers extra functionality, such as extra commands,\ncustom macros, and new tools. This blog will detail the infection process and subsequent malware\ndeployment.\n\n**Affected Platforms: Windows**\n\n**Impacted Users: Windows users**\n\n**Impact: Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actor**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Severity Level: Medium**\n\n## Examining the phishing e-mail\n\nLike so many computer-based attacks, this one began as a phishing e-mail sent to an organization in\nUkraine.\n\nFigure 1. E-mail to the target recipient.\n\nSpelling and grammar issues aside, like most good phishing campaigns this one provides a time sensitive\nstatement urging the recipient to urgently review the attached order.\n\nLooking deeper at the e-mail and where it came from, we can see some additional information in the\nheaders.\n\nFigure 2. E-mail headers showing the origin of the message.\n\nFigure 2b. Parked page.\n\nThe e-mail originated at an address of 194[.]99[.]46[.]38 that corresponds to slot0.warongsoto.com. This is\nhosted on a run-of-the-mill VPS server. Visiting the server, we noticed that the site states that the server\ncontrol panel is controlled by VESTA. Recent CVE data highlights that Vesta Control Panel is affected by\nremote command execution and elevation of privilege vulnerabilities that ultimately allow for full\n[compromise of the system (CVE-2020-10786 and](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-10786) [CVE-2020-10787).](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-10787)\n\nThe domain itself appears to be either abandoned or at least unused with no active content hosted. It was\nregistered in the United States in October 2021.\n\nThe originating e-mail address does not appear to reference an actual individual and a search for other\ninstances of this being used elsewhere came up empty.\n\n## Examining the dropper – stage 1\n\n### Phase 1\n\nDropping the final payload occurs in multiple phases, making this, in actuality, a very complex operation.\nAs shown in Figure 1, attached to the e-mail is the file “order001.ppam”. This is an add-in file format used\nby Microsoft PowerPoint that, in this case, contains a malicious macro that acts as a dropper for Agent\nTesla.\n\nThe first phase of stage 1 begins with opening the PPAM attachment to activate the macro contained\nwithin.\n\nFigure 3. Visual Basic macro contained within “order001.ppam”.\n\nOnce the macro is executed, it will reach out to the URL shortener Bit.ly to download the next phase of the\ndropper. The address used is: hXXp://www[.]bitly[.]com/awnycnxbcxncbrpopor/\n\n### Phase 2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe call out to Bitly will be redirected to a location on MediaFire – a file hosting site\n(hXXp://download2261[.]mediafire[.]com/6lcqxbws032g/wctsdmx4dsh95xs/19.htm). As possibly inferred,\nthis was a campaign and not simply directed at one recipient. There were multiple files made available\nover several days, as shown below in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4. MediaFire repository showing multiple other files from this campaign.\n\nEach of the files is very similar (with minor tweaks) to the download location of the next step. Figure 5,\nbelow, shows 19.htm as it appears if downloaded directly.\n\nFigure 5. HTM file as it appears when downloaded.\n\nIf we arrange the file into a more readable format, we get a better sense of what it’s trying to do.\n\nFigure 6. Key part of the HTM file.\n\nAs seen in Figure 6, the file attempts to taskkill several applications and services followed by adding a\nscheduled task into the Windows Task scheduler. The script then attempts to download and execute\nanother file from MediaFire - hXXp://www[.]mediafire[.]com/file/otza6n31talvvle/19.dll.\n\n### Phase 3\n\nWhile the file extension gives the impression of a Microsoft dynamic link library (.dll), 19.dll is in actuality a\nPowerShell script containing instructions in a large amount of hexadecimal data.\n\nFigure 7. HTM file as it appears when downloaded.\n\nOnce executed, the hexadecimal data will be transformed into additional PowerShell commands that will\nrun in memory. For example, new registry keys will be added to assist with persistence.\n\nFigure 8. Added entries to the Windows Registry.\n\nIf captured and reviewed, the entries that stand out the most are two large, compressed byte arrays —\n$nona and $STRDYFUGIHUYTYRTESRDYUGIRI.\n\nFigure 9. Large byte arrays.\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 9, the byte arrays are then decompressed for use. Once decompressed, these\ncan be saved as executable Windows files. $nona is the larger of the two and is Agent Tesla.\n$STRDYFUGIHUYTYRTESRDYUGIRI will inject Agent Tesla into a running Windows process.\n\nRenaming 19.dll to 19.ps1 allows it to be executed as a normal PowerShell script. With this particular\nsample, it will attempt to launch and then inject Agent Tesla into the aspnet_compiler.exe application.\n\nFigure 10. On the left, the PowerShell script can be seen to be launching aspnet_compiler.exe\n\n## Examining the malware – stage 2\n\nAt its core, Agent Tesla is a keylogger and RAT (Remote Access Trojan). It will take any results captured\nfrom the keyboard and clipboard and send them back to its C2 (Command and Control) server. In this\ninstance, once injected into the aspnet _compiler.exe process Agent Tesla will be up and running. With\nentries in the registry it will have persistence to run even if the host machine is rebooted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Agent Tesla running inside a debugger.\n\n[As can be seen in Figure 11, this variant is similar to one FortiGuard Labs has analyzed previously.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/phishing-campaign-targeting-korean-to-deliver-agent-tesla-new-variant)\n\nFrom this point, it will run in the background and observe the user, recording their actions and sending\nthem back to the threat actor.\n\nFigure 12. Typical connection cycle to Agent Tesla’s C2.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreat actors for the most part like to use lures that are tried and true, as was the case here with the\ninvoicing phishing e-mail, because they continue to enjoy success. The dropper attached to the phishing\ne-mail shows the continuing evolution and complexity required to evade modern security controls\ncombined with the need to traverse several gates to arrive at the release point for the final payload.\n\nOnce finally deployed to a system, the ability to obfuscate and hide inside everyday files and processes\nproves that Agent Tesla is a very capable and formidable threat. Unfortunately, this trend towards\nincreasing sophistication is unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortiMail’s integrated antivirus, sandbox, and content disarm and reconstruction (CDR) functions detect\nand disable this malicious attachment.
