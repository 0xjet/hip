[Sandworm, also known as Sandworm Team, Quedagh, and VOODOO BEAR,](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/threat/threat.xhtml?threat=1003869&owner=Common%20Community#/)\nis a Russian threat actor group that has historically targeted energy, industrial, government,\nand media organizations in Ukraine.\n\nThreatConnect Research, in conjunction with industry colleagues, identified a network of\nprobable Sandworm infrastructure dating back to at least 2018. NSA released a report on\nSandworm activity on May 29 2020 that identified the domain hostapp.be (IPs:\n[95.216.13[.]196,](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=95.216.13.196&owner=Common%20Community) [103.94.157[.]5). This domain was registered on December 24 2018 through](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=103.94.157.5&owner=Common%20Community)\nNjalla. In reviewing historical registrations, we were only able to identify seven other domains\nthat were registered on that date through Njalla. While we were unable to directly associate\nany of these domains to hostapp.be due to its lack of a creation timestamp, three of the other\n[domains — fbapp[ ]top fbapp[ ]info fbapp[ ]link — appeared notable and possibly related](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=fbapp.top&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe reviewed the hosting history, subdomains, and co-locations for these additional domains\nand to-date have identified a network of 30 domains, 17 IPs, and hundreds of subdomains\nthat we assess probably are related with largely historic Sandworm activity. Further indicative\nof the probable association to Sandworm, some of the identified domains, such as\n[hostapp[.]art and](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=hostapp.art&owner=Common%20Community) [hostapp[.]link, share strings with the domain identified in NSA’s report.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=hostapp.link&owner=Common%20Community)\n\nIn reviewing subdomains for the identified domains, many subdomains strings were reused\nacross the domains. Many Twitter, Google, and Facebook-related subdomains were\nidentified. The following notable subdomain strings were also identified and possibly are\nindicative of operational targets, themes, or affected countries:\n\npassport.abv.bg.*\npassport.above.bg.*\nmail.bg.*\naccounts.ukr.net.*\nmail.adm.khv.ru.*\n\nIt’s important to note that while the identified infrastructure is largely historic, at least two\ndomains — [userarea[.]click (46.4.10[.]58) and](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=userarea.click&owner=Common%20Community) [userarea[.]eu (185.226.67[.]190) — and/or](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=userarea.eu&owner=Common%20Community)\ntheir subdomains were actively resolving in May 2020. At this time, we do not have any\nadditional insight into how or against whom this infrastructure has been operationalized.\n\n## Update 5/31/20\n\nThreatConnect Research identified another set of domains and IPs that are a part of this\nnetwork of probable Sandworm infrastructure. The following domains were registered\nthrough Njalla at essentially the same time as userarea[.]click and userarea[.]eu and are\ncurrently hosted on dedicated servers:\n\n[userarea[.]top (194.117.236[.]33)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=userarea.top&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[userarea[.]in (5.255.90[.]243)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=userarea.in&owner=Common%20Community)\n\nThree other domains were registered through Njalla about two and a half hours later:\n\n[myaccount[.]click (185.76.68[.]70)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=myaccount.click&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[myaccount[.]one (92.62.139[.]114)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=myaccount.one&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[webcache[.]one (195.211.197[.]25)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=webcache.one&owner=Common%20Community)\n\nNotably, four of these IP addresses were identified by GreyNoise as exploiting the Exim\n[vulnerability CVE-2019-10149.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/tags/tag.xhtml?tag=CVE-2019-10149&owner=Common+Community&owners=631&owner=Common%20Community#/)\n\n## Update 6/3/20\n\n\n-----\n\n[Two other domains — userzone[.]one and](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=userzone.one&owner=Common%20Community) [userzone[.]eu — are associated with this network](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=userzone.eu&owner=Common%20Community)\nof infrastructure. These domains were registered through Njalla on November 13 2019, the\nsame day as those in the previous update. These domains and/or their subdomains have\n[been hosted on a dedicated server at 141.101.196[.]50.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=141.101.196.50&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n**ThreatConnect Research Team Intelligence: Items recently created or updated in the**\nThreatConnect Common Community by our Research Team.\n\n[20200604B: Additional Entertainment Industry Spoofed Infrastructure ThreatConnect](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=3263759732#/)\nResearch identified additional domains and subdomains that spoof organizations in or\n[related to the entertainment industry.
