The group focuses on companies that have**\n**intellectual property or sensitive information like those in the Defense and High-Tech**\n**industries. The group is known to use custom malware called Daserf, but also employs**\n**multiple commodity and custom tools, exploit vulnerabilities, and use social engineering**\n**techniques.**\n\n**Regarding the command and control (C2) infrastructure, Tick previously used domains**\n**registered through privacy protection services to keep their anonymity, but have moved to**\n**compromised websites in recent attacks. With multiple tools and anonymous infrastructure,**\n**they are running longstanding and persistent attack campaigns. We have observed that the**\n**adversary has repeatedly attacked a high-profile target in Japan using multiple malware�**\n**families for the last three years.**\n\n### Tick Tools\n\n**[Symantec was first to publicly report on Tick, followed by �LAC in 2016. These reports](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/adobe-zero-day-used-ladyboyle-attack)**\n**discussed the group’s malware, Daserf (a.k.a Muirim or Nioupale) and some additional**\n**downloader programs. Though Daserf wasn’t a popular attack tool at the time of publishing**\n**[the two reports, it dates back to at least 2011. Using AutoFocus, we were able to identify the](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/autofocus)**\n**link among Daserf and two other threats, 9002 and Invader. These threats shared**\n**infrastructure between July 2012 and April 2013.**\n\n**_Figure 1 Sharing C2 servers among threats_**\n\n**Invader (a.k.a Kickesgo) is a backdoor that injects its main code into a legitimate process,**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Captures screenshots**\n**Opens cmd.exe shell**\n**Enumerates processes**\n**Executes programs**\n**Removes itself**\n**Enumerates all opening TCP and UDP ports**\n\n**9002 is the infamous RAT frequently seen in targeted attacks reported by various security**\n**[vendors, including Palo Alto Networks. Interestingly, the C2 servers linking 9002 to Daserf](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/9002/)**\n**[were described in the report of an Adobe Flash Zero-day attack from FireEye in 2013. These](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/02/lady-boyle-comes-to-town-with-a-new-exploit.html)**\n**domains were registered through the privacy protection services in 2008 and 2011.**\n\n**krjregh.sacreeflame[.]com�**\n**lywja.healthsvsolu[.]com**\n\n**Though we don’t know the targets of these malware samples at the time of writing this article,**\n**we suspect the same group is behind these threats for a number of reasons. The samples of**\n**Daserf that shared infrastructure were submitted to VirusTotal only from Japan multiple times**\n**in 2013. As noted in a later section, another Invader sample shared different C2 servers with�**\n**Daserf. Symantec reported that Tick exploited additional Adobe Flash and Microsoft Office�**\n**[vulnerabilities. SecureWorks said the adversary group is abusing a previously undisclosed](https://www.secureworks.jp/resources/rp-bronze-butler)**\n**vulnerability in Japanese Software Asset Management system on endpoints. Therefore, Tick**\n**or their digital quartermaster is capable of deploying new and unique exploits.**\n\n### Minzen and Nameless Backdoor\n\n**In July 2016, we identified a compromised website in Japan that was hosting a Daserf variant.�**\n**The web server was also a C2 server for another threat, Minzen (a.k.a, XXMM, Wali, or**\n**ShadowWali). The threat often uses compromised web servers in Japan and the Republic of**\n**Korea.**\n\n**[As Kaspersky and Cybereason recently posted, Minzen is a modular malware that has both](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78010/old-malware-tricks-to-bypass-detection-in-the-age-of-big-data/)**\n**32-bit and 64-bit components in its resource section or configuration data in its body. One of�**\n**the Minzen samples (SHA256:**\n**9374040a9e2f47f7037edaac19f21ff1ef6a999ff98c306504f89a37196074a2) found in the�**\n**Republic of Korea in December 2016 installs simple backdoor module as a final payload on a�**\n**compromised computer. It opens a TCP port and receives commands from a remote attacker.**\n**According to the debug path in the body, the author of the tool called it “NamelessHdoor,”**\n**and its internal version is identified as “V1.5.”�**\n\n**_Figure 2 Debug path left in the backdoor module in Minzen_**\n\n**The payload is based on “Nameless Backdoor” which has been publicly available for more**\n**than ten years. The oldest code we could identify was hosted on a famous Chinese source**\n**code sharing site since 2005. The author of the NamelessHdoor appears to have created**\n**additional versions of the Nameless Backdoor by removing unnecessary functions, and**\n**[added open-source DLL injection code from ReflectiveDLLLoader�.](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3 Nameless Backdoor posted on Chinese Source File Sharing Site_**\n\n**There is minimal public information regarding the Nameless Backdoor, except for the**\n**[interesting report from Cyphort in 2015. The researcher of the company analyzed multiple](https://www.cyphort.com/multiple-malwares-used-to-target-an-asian-financial-institution/)**\n**threats, including Invader, Nioupale(Daserf) and Hdoor found in an attack against an Asian**\n**financial institution. We examined the sample described in the report as Hdoor and found it’s�**\n**a previous version of the NamelessHdoor we discovered in the Minzen sample, but without**\n**support for DLL injection.**\n\n**_Figure 4 Strings in NamelessHdoor sample found in 2015_**\n\n### Shared Infrastructure and Cipher Code with Custom Gh0st\n\n**Other interesting samples in the report are dllhost.exe and Shell64.dll. We don’t have the**\n**same files but found possible variants close to their description in the article. These include�**\n**the following:**\n\n**Executable files that connect to the same remote server, blog.softfix.co[.]kr:80,�**\n**download a DLL file and execute the ‘lowmain’ export function.�**\n**DLL files have ‘lowmain’ and ‘main’ exports.�**\n\n**It turned out that the DLL files we found are a custom variant of Gh0st RAT, and the EXE files�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The domain, softfix.co[.]kr was registered in 2014. One of subdomains, news.softfix.co[.]kr�**\n**was the C2 server of Daserf (SHA256:**\n**9c7a34390e92d4551c26a3feb5b181757b3309995acd1f92e0f63f888aa89423). Another**\n**subdomain, bbs.softfix.co[.]kr was hosted on same IP address as bbs.gokickes[.]com, which�**\n**was reported as the C2 server of Invader by Cyphort. We also identified www.gokickes[.]com�**\n**was the C2 of another Invader variant (SHA256:**\n**57e1d3122e6dc88d9eb2989f081de88a0e6864e767281d509ff58834928895fb).�**\n\n**In addition to the infrastructure, the attacker also shared code. The Gh0st downloaders**\n**employ simple substitution ciphers for hiding strings.**\n\n**_Figure 5 Decryption code in Gh0st Downloader_**\n\n**The cipher converts one character to another based on a substitution table, which can be**\n**seen below. As an example, the character ‘K’ in plain text is changed to ‘5’ in cipher text, ‘h’**\n**is converted to ‘j’ and so on.

An overview of the connections among these threats is discussed in below.**\n\n**_Figure 6 Links among threats and servers_**\n\n**HomamDownloader is a small downloader program with minimal interesting characteristics**\n**from a technical point of view. HomamDownloader was discovered to be delivered by Tick via**\n**a spearphishing email. The adversary crafted credible email and attachment after**\n**understanding the targets and their behavior.**\n\n**The email below was sent from a personal email account with a subject line of “New Year**\n\n\n-----\n\n**extension from ._X_ to .exe and opening it with the password specified in the email to�**\n**view the Happy New Year eCard in the correct and polite language.**\n\n**_Figure 7 Spearphishing Email with HomamDownloader_**\n\n**The image above is translated to the following in English:**\n\n**_Dear XXXX,_**\n\n**_Heartfelt Greetings for the New Year._**\n**_Thank you very much for your support over the past year._**\n**_I will greatly appreciate your further guidance and encouragement._**\n\n**_Would you please change the file extension of the attachment from “._X_” to “.exe” and open�_**\n**_it?_**\n**_Password is “nengajyo”._**\n\n**For those who are not familiar with Japanese companies, the email must look suspicious,**\n**especially given that the executable file attachment has the incorrect file extension. However,�**\n**this may look legitimate in some cases. Many Japanese companies introduced a file�**\n**encryption system for secure data exchange over email. The system encrypts documents**\n**with a user-specified password and often creates a self-extracting (SFX) file for ease of�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**the attachment by an email gateway or security product. The adversary may know Japanese**\n**enterprise users exchange these emails in such a way and crafts the spearphishing email in**\n**the same manner.**\n\n**In addition to the social engineering email technique, the attacker also employs a trick to the**\n**attachment. The actor embedded malicious code to a resource section of the legitimate SFX**\n**file created by a file encryption tool, and modified the entry point of the program for jumping�**\n**to the malicious code soon after the SFX program starts. The malicious code drops**\n**HomamDownloader, then jumps back to the regular flow in the CODE section, which in turn�**\n**asks the user the password and decrypts the file. Therefore, once a user executes the�**\n**attachment and sees the password dialog on SFX, the downloader dropped by the malicious**\n**code starts working even if the user chooses the Cancel on the password window. Should the**\n**user become aware of the infection later, it may be difficult to find the cause due to the fact�**\n**that the original embedded file contained within the SFX is benign.�**\n\n**_Figure 8 Execution flow of Patched SFX file�_**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Tick was spotted last year, but they are actively and silently attacking various organizations in**\n**South Korea and Japan for a number of years. While some of the group’s tools, tactics, and**\n**procedures (TTPs) have been covered within this article, it is likely there is much that still**\n**remains uncovered.**\n\n**Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by these threats in the following ways:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.
