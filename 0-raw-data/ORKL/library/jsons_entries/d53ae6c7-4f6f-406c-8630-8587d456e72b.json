    "plain_text": "# Annual Threat trends 2021\n\n**intrinsec.com/annual-threat-trends-2021/**\n\nEquipe Cyber Threat Intelligence February 8, 2022\n\n## Surge in ransomware attacks\n\n 2722\n\nThat’s the total number of ransomware attacks claimed in 2021, corresponding to 7\nclaims per day\n\n**Targeted geography**\n\nWhen looking at the victimology of ransomware operators, one significant fact stands out: the\ngeographical distribution of victims. Although few countries have been spared (108 countries\ntargeted in total), this victimology points to two major trends :\n\n– North America and Western Europe entities represent priority targets for these actors\n\n– The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Russia remain untouched areas by\nthese attacks\n\n**Most active ransomware operators in France**\n\n[The majority of incident responses involving CERT Intrinsec have been from actors whose](https://www.intrinsec.com/cert-intrinsec/)\nattribution cannot be certain. However, several cases have been explicit enough to be able to\ndetermine with certainty the nature of the ransomware operators. This year, among the\nobserved cases, the most prolific actors were Conti, Darkside, Ryuk and Lockbit. Our daily\nmonitoring of data leak websites shows that these actors remain in the top 10 most active\nransomware affiliates against French entities (see Figure 1.)\n\n**Most common techniques used by the most active ransomware operators**\n\nWe have analyzed the tactics, techniques and procedures employed by the 10 most active\nransomware operators in 2021. This analysis reveals that the following techniques are\nshared by at least 6 of the 10 selected groups :\n\n– Initial Access: External Remote Services (T113)\n\n– Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)\n\n– Defense Evasion: Impair Defense (Disable or Modify Tools) (T1562.001)\n\n– Discovery: File and Directory Discovery (T1083)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Top 10 most active ransomware against France in 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Most active ransomware operators against French entities, based on data leak_\n_website monitoring_\n\n## Initial access vector: vulnerabilities and phishing on the top\n\nOur SOC and CERT operations as well as our monitoring on hacking platforms shows that\n[phishing and vulnerabilities exploitation remain the most common techniques employed by](https://www.intrinsec.com/bonnes-pratiques-phishing/)\nthreat actors to gain an initial foothold on targeted networks.\n\n**Exploitation of remote access appliances**\n\nThis is a trend largely documented in 2020 after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic,\nRDP and VPN appliances used by employees to access their network remotely increased\nthe attack surface of the corporate network. On the 49 missions covered by our CERT\nthroughout 2021 and with a pandemic still ongoing, Citrix, Fortinet, SonicWall and Pulse\nappliances have been largely exploited by threat actors to compromise networks. The\ninterest in RDP is also largely observed on hacking platforms with a lot of initial access\nbrokers specialized in selling this type of product as shown in the next slide.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Most frequent vulnerabilities**\n\nAmong the most exploited vulnerabilities identified by our CERT in 2021, Microsoft Exchange\nServer and ProxyShell exploits in particular are far ahead in terms of frequency with 18% of\nincidents involving one of these vulnerabilities. However, more than 20% of all the\nvulnerabilities observed by our CERT as being actively exploited in 2021 are dating back\nfrom 2020, 2019 and 2018. Patches are not always applied immediately, allowing threat\nactors to exploit vulnerabilities months after their public releases. For example, ZeroLogon’s\nvulnerability CVE-2020-1472, discovered in 2020, has continued to be exploited by actors\nsuch as Conti and Darkside during the first half of 2021. This interest for vulnerabilities\ndemonstrated by threat actors is largely supported by our SOC operations as in 15 496\ndetections in 2021 “Execution of malicious code attempts” remains one of the most observed\none (13%).\n\n**Phishing**\n\n[Two key statistics highlighted by our SOC and CERT reveal that threat actors keep using](https://www.intrinsec.com/soc-securite-operationnelle/)\nphishing to get an initial foothold on a network :\n\n– 12% of the incident responses conducted by CERT Intrinsec involved phishing attempts;\n\n– The incident type “malicious link” is among the most observed one by our SOC (alongside\n\n\n-----\n\naggressive port scans, aggressive subnet scans and bruteforce attempts)\nThis initial access technique is used by threat actors distributing loaders such as Emotet,\nIceID, Bazar Loader or QakBot. This type of threat continues to target corporates and is\noften combined with other threats such as the exploitation of known vulnerabilities or\nransomware, making them potentially\n\n## Cybercrime marketplace still going strong\n\nThe activity on cybercrime marketplaces keeps growing, as well as shifting from Dark\ntowards Surface Web platforms. Our investigations conducted on these networks throughout\n2021 identify particularly strong demand for the diverse typologies of criminal goods and\nservices as follows :\n\n### 33% Vulnerabilities\n\nPronounced interest in buying/selling Remote Desktop Protocol configurations for fraudulent\naccess to systems of companies operating across multiple sectors. SQL injections to target\nvulnerable websites are also in high demand.\n\n### 33% Customer Data\n\nStolen customer databases, containing sensitive information such as connection credentials\nto diverse online services or financial data, remain one of the most popular goods on\ncybercrime networks.\n\n### 29% Company Data\n\nEmployee connection credentials to internal companies’ internal services, i.e. efficient\nvectors of compromise, are a sought-after product. Likewise for internal sensitive or\nconfidential data, such as strategic projects or HR information.\n\n### 5% Counterfeit goods / services\n\n\n-----\n\nDemand for counterfeit goods and services on criminal marketplaces is persistent, although\nhandled to a lesser extent from the viewpoint of CTI teams (dealing mostly with cases of\nfraudulent configurations imitating real services).\n\n## Zero-days and supply chain attacks\n\n Most impactful 2021 flaws involving Zero-Day vulnerabilities and/or a supply chain attack\n\n**JANUARY 2021**\n\n**05/01/2021**\n\nUS intelligence agencies formally accuse Russia of association with the SolarWinds attack\nthat dates back in September 2019\n\nRussian-state sponsored attackers inserted a backdoor into SolarWinds Orion IT monitoring\nsoftware updates to 18,000 government entities and Fortune 500 companies. Through this,\nmalware was distributed to at least nine US federal agencies and more than 100 companies\n\n**MARCH 2021**\n\n**01/03/2021**\n\nAccellion releases a last patch based on IR mandiant report fixing a series of 0-day\nvulnerabilities affecting Accellion File Transfer Appliance compromise that started back in\n\n\n-----\n\nDecember 2020;\n\nAttacks carried out by a Russian-speaking cybercriminal group known as FIN11 using zerodays against Accellion FTA servers hit around 100 companies across the world in December\n2020 and January 2021. In some cases FIN11 leveraged CLOP double extortion\ninfrastructure\n\n**03/03/2021**\nMass exploitation of Microsoft on-prem Exchange RCE dubbed Proxylogon. Indications of\nretroactive exploitation dating back two weeks\n\nIn March 2021 Chinese cyber espionage groups exploited four vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s\non-premises Exchange Server software. This compromised more than 100,000 servers\nworldwide.\nBeyond the intelligence gathering from emails, the latter were abused for hijack existing\nemail threads by the infamous Emotet botnet\n\n**JULY 2021**\n\n02/06/2021\nPre-auth remote code execution of 0-day exploits against Kaseya VSA server\n\nAt the end of June Kaseya, which provides a service to manage enterprise IT infrastructures,\nwas compromised by the Russia-based REvil criminal gang. Kaseya can deploy software\nupdates (patches) to the systems under management, so REvil used this to push\nransomware to all Kaseya customers, affecting thousands of companies worldwide. 100 had\nsome measure of impact from the attack, with another 25 of those experiencing significant\ndata loss.\n\n**DECEMBER 2021**\n\n**01/12/2021**\nThe first proof of exploitation attempts would have been observed by Cloudflare and Cisco\nTalos\n\nThis open-source component is widely used across many suppliers’ software and services.\nNot only numerous state-sponsored threats crystallized on the situation as well as top-tier\nransomcartels but also coin miners and botnets.\n\n\n-----",
