    "plain_text": "# WeTheNorth: A New Canadian Dark Web Marketplace\n\n**recordedfuture.com/wethenorth-canadian-dark-web/**\n\nThis Summer, Insikt Group discovered a new Canada-focused darknet marketplace called\nWeTheNorth, a salute to the Toronto Raptors basketball team slogan. This localized criminal\nmarketplace features a variety of illegal goods and services for sale, many of which pose a\nthreat to local and global enterprises.\n\nInsikt Group judges that with moderate confidence that WeTheNorth market was likely\ncreated to replace the now debunked The Canadian Headquarters, which shut down in July\n2021. Insikt Group’s Criminal Underground Team first discovered WeTheNorth in July 2021\nin advertisements posted on open source forums such as Reddit. The new market appears\nsimilar in appearance to the now-debunked Empire market, Alpha Bay, and Torrez.\n\nWhat makes WeTheNorth unique is the lengths the administrators have gone to create a\nmarketplace that is ostensibly geared toward protecting Canadian buyers and sellers and\nfostering a relatively safe place to complete transactions.\n\nTheir mission statement is “to provide a safe environment so that Canadians are able to\npurchase safely, scam-free and away from the street violence, drugs and other items that are\nmore potent, cleaner and safer to use.”\n\nThe rules of the marketplace are geared towards reigning in what types of services can be\nsold, as well as being explicit about what is not allowed: sharing of third-party contact\ninformation, sales of weapons, and anything related to terrorism.\n\nAdditional safeguards include mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) for all vendors,\nwhen signing up users are given a unique token to protect their account, vendor fees are\nnon-refundable to prevent scamming, and there are rules in place to prevent padding\naccounts with fake reviews.\n\nLike many darknet markets that operate in service of customers, WeTheNorth offers 24/7\ncustomer service in both English and French, and it’s open to anyone who uses the site.\nVendors or buyers having trouble with the site can reach out and ask for assistance at any\n\n\n-----\n\ntime, report technical issues, vendor problems, and scams.\n\nThe types of transactions that occur on WeTheNorth are largely illegal and undermine any\nappearance of legitimacy. The most popular sales are drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and\nparty drugs, but WeTheNorth marketplace also allows the sale of digital products such as\nstolen credit cards, login credentials, accesses, software and hardware exploits, fraud\ntutorials, and more.\n\nInsikt Group researchers discovered issues with the policing and categorization of listings on\nWeTheNorth market. Many items are cross-posted and do not align with the category they\nare listed under. The administrator of the site, whose contact information is also associated\nwith other darknet markets, has not cracked down on cross-category posting and multiple\nlistings, which could be an indicator that their attention is still focused elsewhere, leaving\nWeTheNorth open to low-level drug sellers that wish to bypass market rules.\n\nWeTheNorth is a new Canadian dark web marketplace that appears to be hosting a semisafe space for locals to sell illegal goods and services. There are strict rules in place and\nthey have banned certain categories to help the site be more legitimate and not attract a\ncertain clientele.\n\nDark web markets like WeTheNorth serve as valuable sources of cyber threat intelligence for\nboth private and public sector alike. Insikt Group has observed an increase in localized dark\nweb markets and predicts with moderate confidence that criminal underground websites\nsuch as WeTheNorth will continue to increase as international criminals look to localize\noperations and avoid international law enforcement. As law enforcement cracks down on\ndark markets and threat actors move quickly to stand up replacement websites, it is\nimperative for information security teams to monitor these sources for fraud, theft, and\ntargeting of employees, and be able to stop fraudsters and cybercriminals before they use\nthese tools to move through the attack chain. Recorded Future clients can access more\ninformation about WeTheNorth market and other darknet activity through Intelligence Cards\nin the Recorded Future platform.\n\n\n-----",
