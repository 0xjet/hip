APT17 hacked Chinese targets and offered the data for sale\n\n**[intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2019/07/25/encore-apt17-hacked-chinese-targets-and-offered-the-data-for-sale/](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2019/07/25/encore-apt17-hacked-chinese-targets-and-offered-the-data-for-sale/)**\n\nintrusiontruth July 25, 2019\n\nWe started this story with Guo Lin (郭林), identified to us as an MSS Officer. We showed that\nhe had personal links to a number of companies and individuals involved in Cyber security,\nat least one of whom helped develop a key tool used by APT17. We have also shown direct\nlinks between Guo Lin’s company Antorsoft and the Chinese Ministry of State Security.\n\nBut what were APT17 really doing? We know from media coverage in our part of the world\nthat APT17 hacked a number of targets in the West and did untold damage. What isn’t well\nknown is that they were also hackers for hire, acquiring data and selling it for profit.\n\n**The sales brochure**\n\nThe images below show a ‘Price List’ made available to this blog by an analyst working with\nus. Members of APT17 actively circulated this list amongst the hacking community in China\nseeking buyers.\n\nThe list shows data for sale, and not just from Western companies…\n\n\n-----\n\n_Either, APT17 has some sort of domestic remit, acquiring data on Chinese citizens and_\nselling it to the MSS (but that is unlikely, because China’s new intelligence law compels\ncompanies to provide information required by the government, and the price list certainly\nwouldn’t be circulated online).\n\n_Or, the MSS has lost all control of APT17, which is hacking Chinese victims and selling the_\ndata to the highest bidder.\n\n**Which do you think?**\n\n\n-----",
