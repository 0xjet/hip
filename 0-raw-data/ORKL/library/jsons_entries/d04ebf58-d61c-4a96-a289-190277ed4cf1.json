In between those highly advanced\nattacks, more and more attackers possessing only a basic set of skills started to pop up – spreading\nwell known RATs, obfuscated with generic publicly-available packers.\n\nThis report focuses on the CopyKittens, a mid-level group.\n\nThe CopyKittens attacks are effective and advanced in a few ways:\n\n  - Infecting of computers is performed in multi-stage, stealthy method\n\n  - Data exfiltration is performed over DNS protocol\n\n  - They avoid using known RATs and packers, tools are \"homemade\"\n\n  - Constant development is performed to overcome security products improvements\n\nYet, this group is clearly not made up of dozens of high-end computer and security experts. The\nCopyKittens assembled major parts of their attack from code snippets carefully picked from public\nrepositories and online forums, hence their nickname. We also named their attack tool\n\"Matryoshka\"[1] due to the fact that it was written as a multi-stage framework, with each part of it\nbuilt to integrate its subsequent step.\n\nWe have had only a partial window to the targets of these semi-sophisticated yet highly effective\nattacks. Among them were high ranking diplomats at Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some\nwell-known Israeli academic researchers specializing in Middle East Studies. Even if we combine\nthis with the fact that attackers goal seemed to be theft of sensitive data, we still lack the ability\nto clearly identify who is behind this attacks and if it was sponsored by another major actor.\n\nIn our opinion, this will not be the last time we hear from this group. Their constant striving toward\nimproved performance, the fact that they probably executed successful attacks and the current\nturmoil in the Middle East region leads us to the conclusion that the CopyKittens will keep striking\ntargets with similar profiles in the near future.\n\n1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n### The Group Attack Cycle \nCopyKittens has conducted at least three waves of cyber-attacks in the past year. In each of the\nattacks the infection method was almost identical and included an extraordinary number of stages\nused to avoid detection. As with other common threat actors, the group relies on social\nengineering methods to deceive its targets prior to infection.\n\n#### Step One – Spear Phishing \nThe attack is initiated by sending an infected document file as an email attachment. In most cases\nthe email subjects have been carefully chosen to match the target’s interests. We were able to\nretain a copy of an email used to target an Israeli ambassador in a large eastern European country.\nSome of the emails subjects were:\n\n1. _Registration form to the United Nations CTITF (Counter Terrorism Implementation Task Force)._\n2. _[Israeli MFA] questionnaire - URGENT– An original paper, probably stolen in previous attacks[2]._\n\nThe email contains the first link in the chain, a word document, containing an OLE binary object.\n\n2 https://malwr.com/analysis/ZDg3Nzg3MDM3MWQwNDdmNTgwYWRmOTJkNWFhYTQ0ZjY/\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\nThe embedded binary objects in the lure documents contained a trailing “fdp.scr” in their names\nwith a special invisible Unicode character. This character officially described as \"Right-To-Left\nOverride\" flips the directionality of the string from its position and onward.\n\nFor example, if we name a file \"filename [special flipping char]fdp.scr\" it will be displayed as\n\"filename rcs.pdf”.\n\nThis form of subterfuge has been previously employed by other Middle Eastern threat actors such\nas “Desert Falcons”, reported by Kaspersky[3] and by elements operating in Syria[4].\n\nIn other cases, the document includes instructions motivating the victim to enable macro code\nexecution. If the trap is successful and the user played his part, the infection stage begins.\n\n3 [https://securelist.com/blog/research/68817/the-desert-falcons-targeted-attacks/](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68817/the-desert-falcons-targeted-attacks/)\n4 [http://syrianmalware.com/](http://syrianmalware.com/)\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Step Two - Droppers Matryoshka\nUnlike most malwares, CopyKittens’ tools are bound to each other. The Matryoshka infection\nframework is built of three parts:\n\n  - **Dropper**\n\n`o` Obfuscating code and signaling to the C2 that the file has been executed\n`o` Launching the loader and using it to execute functions.\n`o` Comparing anti-analysis logic and reporting it back to C2\n\n  - **Reflective Loader**\n\n`o` Employing anti-debugging and anti-sandboxing techniques\n`o` Runtime API Address resolver\n`o` Covert DLL injection of the RAT library\n`o` Persistence file on disk\n\n  - **RAT component**\n\n`o` Configuring the Reflective Loader to survive reboots and process exits\n`o` DNS Command and Control communication\n`o` Common RAT functionalities\n\n##### Dropper – SCR PE File \nFiles with scr extension are just the same as exe executables. Windows screen savers originally\nused this extension but nowadays medium-level threat actors commonly use it as a way to deceive\nthe average user who might be deterred from an exe file extension.\n\nThe dropper name always matched the promised content of the spear phishing email.\n\nIn the latest version of the dropper, the lure pdf is saved to the user’s %TEMP% folder with an\n“~st” prefix and random number, followed by a “.pdf” extension. Once the file has been\nsuccessfully saved, the pdf is opened and displayed to the user via ShellExecute API and Open\ncommand. This is done to lower the target's suspicions and mask the true functionality of the\nexecutable.\n\nWhile the user unsuspectingly reads the document, the following routine runs hidden in the\nbackground:\n\nThe malware first unpacks the “Reflective Loader” component into the memory and signals to its\n“C2 parents” the attack has been executed by downloading an image file from a remote server.\nThe URL of the remote file is built out of two constant strings which again might suggest some\nkind of builder to this platform.\n\n  - We believe the first string to be a unique ID of the target or sample.\n\n  - The second is the full URL –\n[“HTTP://DOMAIN/”RandomString”/%s(TargetID)/”CampgainIdentifer”/”NameOFFile”.png”](http://domain/)\n\nAfter signaling to the attackers, the malware calls a specific export function from the Reflective\nLoader named “_check”. This routine is a copied code from the “Pafish” open source project, led\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nby Alberto Ortega (@a0rtega)[5] who describes it as: “A demonstration tool that employs several\ntechniques to detect sandboxes and analysis environments in the same way as malware families\ndo”.\n\nPafish will enumerate and look for known virtualization and sandbox artifacts and then print\nresults back to the researcher screen.\n\nSince the original Pafish code is built to improve security researchers’ ability to discover evasive\nmalware, the CopyKittens group has modified the code logic.\n\nInstead of printing the functions’ results back to the user, the code will now assign a static number\nfrom 1-27 in the case of an artifact being found, and will return that value to the calling function\n(the SCR dropper in this case).\n\nUpon returning from the “_check” function, the dropper will perform a simple comparison and if\nan analysis machine has been detected, it will signal the attackers again using almost the same\nURL as it did before but replacing the name of the “.png” file to the letter “n” concatenated with\nthe number of the artifact found by Pafish.\n\nBelow is a table demonstrating the artifacts and their corresponding value:\n\nsandbox usernames and paths 1,2\n\nGeneric sandbox sleep patch 5\n\nDeleteFile is hooked 6\n\nSandboxie sbiedll is injected 7\n\nWine Linux emulator is present 8\n\nRunning in Virtualbox VM 9-21\n\nRunning in VMWARE VM 22-25\n\nRunning in QEMU VM 26,27\n\n5 [https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish)\n\n7\n\n|sandbox usernames and paths|1,2|\n|---|---|\n|Generic sandbox sleep patch|5|\n|DeleteFile is hooked|6|\n|Sandboxie sbiedll is injected|7|\n|Wine Linux emulator is present|8|\n|Running in Virtualbox VM|9-21|\n|Running in VMWARE VM|22-25|\n|Running in QEMU VM|26,27|\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our investigation we were able to identify an example of this behavior in a VirusTotal\nreport on one of the domains used by the attackers:\n\nWe believe this URL was submitted by a target or other researchers analyzing the malware.\n\nAfter alerting the attackers they have been discovered, the dropper will try to delete the\ntemporary files created by him and terminate activity of the infection process.\n\nIn the case no analysis machine is found, Reflective Loader will be called again with the “_dec”\n(possibly abbreviation of the word “decrypt”) and the third stage of the attack will commence.\n\n#### Step Three - Reflective Loader \nIn an attempt to increase stealthiness, the CopyKittens group has decided to use another open\nsource project[6] by Stephen Fewer (@stephenfewer). The project implements a remote library\ninjection technique called “Reflective DLL Injection”. Fewer describes the method in his paper[7]:\n\n_“Reflective DLL injection is a library injection technique in which the concept of reflective_\n_programming is employed to perform the loading of a library from memory into a host process”._\nThis method enables the RAT library to run on the host machine without a dedicated process and\nwithout registration of the library under the loaded modules.\n\nThe original project was built as a command line utility with the target process identifier provided\nas an argument. In a real attack scenario, the injected process identifier is obviously unknown to\nthe attacker and a suitable host process should be located at runtime. The CopyKittens group has\nimplemented this routine by using WTSEnumerateProcess API to get a list of current active\nprocesses and then trying to get a handle to each process via OpenProces API, avoiding x64\nprocesses.\n\n6 [https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection)\n7 [http://www.harmonysecurity.com/files/HS-P005_ReflectiveDllInjection.pdf](http://www.harmonysecurity.com/files/HS-P005_ReflectiveDllInjection.pdf)\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a suitable host has been found for infection, the rest of Fewer’s project code will be used to\ninject the malicious library and execute the RAT.\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Step Four - RAT Component \nThe main part of “Matryoshka” is a remote administration tool library. It is designed to exist in\nthe infected computer memory and is never written to the computer's physical disk itself.\n\nWhen we “dumped” the RAT to the disk, some of the AV tools detect it with the following\nsignatures:\n\n**Trojan.Jectin identified on April 9[th] 2015 by Symantec[8].**\n\n**Troj/Agent-AMEY that was identified on March 25[th] 2015 by Sophos[9].**\n\nThis, however, is not the case while the RAT is injected into a legitimate host process.\n\n##### Runtime API Address Resolution\nSince the library is injected into memory, the imported functions must be resolved in runtime, to\nsolve this problem the CopyKittens group used a method called “Runtime API Address\nResolution”[10] using the LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress APIs. In order to evade static virus\nscanners in new version of the RAT, the attackers obfuscated the names of the API functions. They\nresolve them in runtime using a simple substitute cipher combined with Base64 encoding. The\nsame trick was used in the Reflective Loader component. We retrieved the original functions\nnames as plaintext strings by using a simple Python script. A list of decrypted API strings and the\npython code can be found in the Appendix and Minerva Labs Research GitHub repository[11].\n\n##### Installation and Persistence \nSince the RAT library was built to run from the memory of a host process, it relies on the loader\nto survive system restart. The first time the RAT runs, it will copy the reflective loader, named\n“kernel.dll” to one of Windows’ common folders and will create a registry key named {0355F5D0467C-30E9-894C-C2FAEF522A13} under “SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run”\nwith the value of “C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe \"\\%LOCATION%\\kernel.dll\" _dec” to rerun the injection routine after each boot.\n\nIn addition, to make sure the RAT always runs (since host process might be closed or crash), the\nRAT creates a task in the Windows task scheduler named “Microsoft Boost Kernel Optimization”\nwhich will re-run the injection routine every 20 minutes. The task scheduler method has also been\nadded to the newest version of the RAT.\n\n[8](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/earthlink_writeup.jsp?docid=2015-040923-3643-99) [http://www.symantec.com/security_response/earthlink_writeup.jsp?docid=2015-040923-3643-99](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/earthlink_writeup.jsp?docid=2015-040923-3643-99)\n[9](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses/viruses-and-spyware/Troj~Agent-AMEY/detailed-analysis.aspx) [https://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses/viruses-and-spyware/Troj~Agent-](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses/viruses-and-spyware/Troj~Agent-AMEY/detailed-analysis.aspx)\n[AMEY/detailed-analysis.aspx](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses/viruses-and-spyware/Troj~Agent-AMEY/detailed-analysis.aspx)\n10\n\n[https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/a_museu](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/a_museum_of_api_obfuscation_on_win32.pdf)\n[m_of_api_obfuscation_on_win32.pdf](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/a_museum_of_api_obfuscation_on_win32.pdf)\n11 [https://github.com/MinervaLabsResearch/BlogPosts](https://github.com/MinervaLabsResearch/BlogPosts)\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\nThis makes the RAT unstable as multiple instances may be executed simultaneously on the same\nhost machine causing unexpected behavior. To reduce this risk, the authors have used a global\nmutex.\n\n##### DNS Command & Control \nThe RAT uses DNS protocol to communicate with the attackers C2 server.\n\nThe DNS queries are constructed from the following sections:\n\n1. C2 domain name\n\n2. The unique ID of the infected machine (computer name + HD serial\n\n3. Random string\n\n4. Data to be transmitted.\n\nTo make traffic analysis and detection more difficult, the group uses a substitute cipher to\nobfuscate the data before it is sent to the C2:\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother way used to disguise the DNS traffic and lower the suspicions of SOC and NOC teams was\nthe use IPs from address blocks of Microsoft and McAfee in the C2 responses:\n\nOnce a command is received from the C2 server in the DNS response, the RAT will translate it to\na corresponding command.\n\nFor example, when the C2 sends a DNS response with the IP address 134.170.185.13, the RAT will\ntry and steal outlook passwords.\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Common RAT Capabilities \n\n_Outlook passwords_\nThis functionality resembles a method described by SecurityExploded [12] for “Recovering\nPasswords from Outlook 2002-2013”. We can assume that the group has copied this code as well.\n\n_Screen Grabbing and Keylogging_\nThis RAT is also capable of screen grabbing and keylogging. Unsurprisingly, here too we were able\nto trace back a portion of the original source code from the popular rohitab.com online forum[13] .\n\n12 [http://securityxploded.com/outlookpasswordsecrets.php](http://securityxploded.com/outlookpasswordsecrets.php) (Recovering Passwords from Outlook 20022013)\n13 [http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/topic/40069-keylogging-all-users-across-windows-7-professional/](http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/topic/40069-keylogging-all-users-across-windows-7-professional/)\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting fact is that the author also copied the registry key described in the installation\nstage above, replacing only a single character of the original randomly generated unique ID.\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Improvement Over Time\nIn comparing samples from different attack cycles, we can easily see that the attackers have spent\ntime improving their tool, making it more persistent and harder to detect.\n\nFor example, between the first versions of the RAT and the latest, the group started to resolve\nmore API during runtime, using obfuscated strings. A comparison of the outlook password\nextraction function from previous and current RAT versions can be seen below.\n\nIn addition, the group has been adding anti sandboxing techniques, such as the code from Pafish\ndescribed above and anti-debugging methods:\n\nThis anti-debugging code seems to have been copied from CodeProject[14], a well-known online\nsource.\n\n14 [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30815/An-Anti-Reverse-Engineering-Guide](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30815/An-Anti-Reverse-Engineering-Guide)\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\n## About Us\n\n\n##### Minerva Labs\nMinerva offers a low footprint endpoint\nprotection platform.
