The customs authorities are investigating the suspicion\n„that software may have been exported without the required export license from the Federal\nOffice of Economics and Export Control“.\n\n[The raids follow our criminal complaint, which we have written and submitted together with](https://freiheitsrechte.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-07-04-FinFisher-Strafanzeige-EN.pdf)\nthe [Society for Freedom Rights,](https://freiheitsrechte.org/illegal-spyware-exports/) [Reporters Without Borders and the](https://rsf.org/en/news/spyware-exports-turkey-rsf-germany-denounces-german-company-finfisher) European Center for\nConstitutional and Human Rights.\n\n## 15 objects\n\n[A spokesperson of the responsible public prosecutor’s office in Munich comments:](https://www.justiz.bayern.de/gerichte-und-behoerden/staatsanwaltschaft/muenchen-1/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn co-operation with the Customs Investigation Bureau and supported by further\nprosecution authorities the public prosecutor’s office Munich I searched 15 objects\n(business premises and private apartments) around Munich and an enterprise from the\nentrepreneurial group in Romania on 06.10.2020. The search lasted until the evening\nof 08.10.2020.\n\nInvestigations are still being conducted against managing directors and employees of\nFinFisher GmbH and at least two other companies on suspicion of violation of the\nForeign Trade and Payments Act. The investigations were started in summer 2019 on\nthe basis of criminal charges.\n\n[German public broadcasting first reported the raid.](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr/spaehsoftware-finfisher-101.html)\n\n## 3 days\n\n[FinFisher advertises its state malware as „complete IT intrusion portfolio“, both](https://netzpolitik.org/2013/interne-gamma-folien-die-fin-familie-staatlicher-ueberwachungstechnologien-als-komplettes-it-intrusion-portfolio/) German\nfederal police and [Berlin police have purchased the powerful surveillance tool.

The authors of the criminal](https://www.accessnow.org/new-report-finfisher-changes-tactics-to-hook-critics/)\ncomplaint assume that FinFisher is developed and produced in Munich. If true, the group of\n[companies needs an export license, which the German government has not issued. An](https://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/110/1911017.pdf#page=25)\n[export without a license would be a criminal offense.](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_awg/englisch_awg.html#p0201)\n\n[FinFisher denies these accusations. In a statutory declaration, the CEO states in September](https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2020/11/2019-09-30_FinFisher-GmbH_Eidesstattliche-Versicherung.pdf)\n2019:\n\nFinFisher Labs GmbH has developed the FinFisher software.\n\nFinFisher GmbH has at no time sold or distributed the FinFisher software in Turkey.\nAgainst this background, FinFisher GmbH has at no time violated export regulations of\nthe Federal Republic of Germany or the EU.\n\nThe [company Elaman also states, it „at no time sold or distributed the FinFisher software in](https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2020/11/2019-10-09_Elaman-GmbH_Eidesstattliche-Versicherung.pdf)\nTurkey“.\n\n## 2 Countries\n\n[After our intial reporting on the criminal complaint, FinFisher took legal action with expensive](https://netzpolitik.org/2019/we-filed-a-criminal-complaint-prosecutor-launches-investigation-into-finfisher-for-illegal-export-of-state-spyware/)\nlawyers and obtained a preliminary injunction against us, which was confirmed by the Berlin\nRegional Court. According to the court our accusations were not provable and our reporting\nwas too one-sided and prejudicial. On the advice of our lawyer, we did not appeal the verdict\nany further.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Customs Investigation Bureau and Public Prosecutors however take the accusations of\ncriminal charges seriously enough to search 15 business premises and private apartments in\nMunich and Romania over a period of three days. If the investigators find enough evidence,\nthey can bring the case to trial.\n\nUntil then the presumption of innocence applies. We have sent a number of questions to\nFinFisher GmbH and its partner companies for this reporting. FinFisher, [as always, has not](https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-gehackt-werbe-videos-von-exploits-und-quelltext-von-finfly-web-veroeffentlicht/)\nresponded to our request for comments.\n\n\n-----",
