We have already provided a detailed analysis of the WhisperGate wiper here.](https://www.lifars.com/2022/01/a-detailed-analysis-of-whispergate-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)\n\nThe Russian APT group Gamaredon (Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM) was attributed to the\nRussian Federal Security Service (FSB) and was identified by Unit 42 researchers [1] and\nMicrosoft [2] targeting Ukrainian organizations in the last few months. Unit 42 collected three\nsignificant clusters of infrastructure (malicious domains, IP addresses, and malware\nsamples).\n\nThe first cluster represents the Gamaredon downloader infrastructure. The threat actor\ndeployed the UltraVNC software to connect back to a remote system (reverse tunnel). The\nsecond cluster contains C2 domains associated with Gamaredon’s file stealer tool. The last\ncluster serves as the C2 infrastructure for a custom RAT called Pteranodon. We recommend\nblocking the IoCs reported by Unit 42 [3] [4].\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example of a lure document used by Gamaredon in the past is displayed in figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1 (Source: Microsoft)_\n\nAfter the WhisperGate attacks that occurred in January 2022, several cybersecurity\ncompanies reported about a new wiper called HermeticWiper [5] [6] [7]. Before deploying the\nwiper, multiple DDoS attacks took place against Ukrainian organizations that were attributed\nto Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).\n\nThe wiper was signed with a certificate issued to a Cyprus-based company called Hermetica\nDigital Ltd. Legitimate drivers from a tool called EaseUS Partition Master were utilized to\ncorrupt the MBR (Master Boot Record) and MFT (Master File Table) for every physical drive.\nAfter a system reboot, the user is presented with the following screen:\n\n_Figure 2 (Source: Unit 42)_\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA also issued an alert regarding the WhisperGate and HermeticWiper wipers [8]. We\nrecommend implementing the mitigation techniques presented in the alert to prevent similar\nattacks.\n\nUAC-0056 (Lorec53) is another threat group that recently attacked organizations in Ukraine\n\n[9]. The infection vector is a spear-phishing email with a document attached containing three\nembedded objects. The malicious document’s purpose is to write a JavaScript file that uses\nPowerShell to download a payload known as SaintBot (downloader) and OutSteel (document\nstealer). The malicious document used in this campaign is displayed below:\n\n_Figure 3_\n\nESET researchers documented a new wiper called IsaacWiper, and a worm that spreads\nHermeticWiper in the LAN called HermeticWizard [10]. HermeticWiper is spread across a\nlocal network via WMI and SMB. IsaacWiper wipes the first 0x10000 bytes of each physical\n[disk using the ISAAC pseudorandom generator and all files on logical drives with random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAAC_(cipher))\nbytes generated by the same generator. A timeline of the events is shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 (Source: ESET)_\n\nAny Ukraine-based company for the next 6 months can get entirely free access\nto [SecurityScorecard’s enterprise license to protect themselves from malware resilience in](https://securityscorecard.com/solutions/enterprise)\nlight of ongoing cyber-attacks. We are also providing them with free access to\nSecurityScorecard forensics remediation team to deal with ransomware issues or to recover\n[from any outage.
