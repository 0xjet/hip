This advanced operation combines a targeted phishing attack with\nadvanced tools that gather intel on the environment. The operation chooses whether or not\nto create persistence and installs a sophisticated backdoor called ServHelper used to take\nover the network.\n\n## Key Aspects of TA505’s Operation\n\nHighly targeted phishing campaign to a small number of specific accounts within the\ncompany.\nSigned and verified malicious code. This is an extra precaution taken to avoid\ndetection.\nA deliberate timeline, indicated by the timing of the phishing attack and signing of the\nmalicious code.\nA selective persistence mechanism and self destruct commands based on autonomous\nreconnaissance.\nLarge emphasis on removal of evidence using self destruct commands and deleting\nscripts.\nMultiple C2 domains, in the event of blacklisting or inability to connect for another\nreason.\n\nThe operation integrates four different LOLBins, which indicates the attackers\ncontinued, advanced attempts to avoid detection.\n\nThe attack was carried out by TA505, a [threat actor that is behind infamous campaigns like](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridex-globeimposter)\nthe infostealer malware Dridex, the Locky ransomware, and more. More recently, TA505\ncarries out targeted attacks on multiple continents, including North America, Asia, Africa, and\n[South America. Primarily focusing on large financial institutions, this group carries out well-](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ta505-targets-financial-retail-1/)\nplanned, advanced attacks in order to extract valuable data it can later leverage.\n\nAs 2019 begins, it is clear that the most widely-used and effective attack vector for malware\nis still email attacks. The initial phishing attack focused on a number of accounts in a specific\nfinancial institution at a single time and date. This enterprise was explicitly targeted with a\n\n\n-----\n\nsmall number of emails to a very small number of accounts within the company. This hints at\nthe possibility of reconnaissance done at an earlier stage of the operation in order to select\nthe best targets.\n\nThe malware uses a signed and verified certification from Sectigo RSA Code Signing CA to\nspread. This is an extra precaution taken to avoid detection. It gives the malware the\nappearance of legitimacy when dealing with various defense mechanisms. Furthermore, the\nmalware was signed mere hours prior to the attack- an indication of the operation’s\ndeliberate timeline and nature.\n\nParticularly interesting and unusual is the selective persistence mechanism used by some of\nthe tools in this operation. Whereas most malware will attempt to gain persistence whenever\npossible, the tools being used in this operation create persistence based on their\nenvironment. The tools will collect information about the target machine and send this\ninformation to a remote C2 server, which will decide whether to set up persistence. This is a\ntechnique commonly used in advanced operations.\n\nThe attackers clearly placed a large emphasis on covering their tracks. The malware\ngathered information specifically to decide whether to remove evidence from an infected\ncomputer. This demonstrates the level of care taken in this operation, and indicates at the\nthreat actor’s potential goal- to plant a backdoor that would remain undetected for as long as\npossible in order to more effectively exfiltrate data.\n\nThe malware makes extensive and varied use of LOLbins and legitimate, native Windows\nOS processes to perform malicious activities, including the delivery of the payload and the\n[implementation of the ServHelper backdoor. The ServHelper backdoor used in this operation](https://threatpost.com/ta505-servhelper-malware/140792/)\n[is a relatively new malware family that was discovered at the end of 2018. This continues the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\ntrend Cybereason researchers have seen over the past several months towards the wider\nadoption of LOLbins for attacks.\n\nCybereason detected the new ServHelper backdoor and analyzed the campaign in order\nto identify the techniques and tools being used.\n\n## A Breakdown of the ServHelper Backdoor Spear Phishing Campaign\n\n_A breakdown of the attack from the Cybereason Platform._\n\n## Phase One: Gaining Access\n\nThis attack begins with a spear phishing attack through a targeted email campaign. Over 80\nfiles were sent to 40 email accounts within the organization, within the span of about an hour.\n[The email contains Microsoft Excel attachments with malicious macros. When the file is](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/create-or-run-a-macro-c6b99036-905c-49a6-818a-dfb98b7c3c9c)\nopened, it loads in Microsoft Excel and urges the user to enable macros.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The malicious .xls files that contains the macros_\n\nAfter the victim clicks the Enable Content button, the macro commands are executed and\n[invoke the Windows OS process msiexec.exe. This process is the Windows Installer, a](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/msi/windows-installer-portal)\nsoftware component and application programming interface of Microsoft Windows used for\nthe installation, maintenance, and removal of software.\n\nThe macro commands use msiexec.exe to connect to a remote C2 server and download the\nfirst stage payload. A second msiexec.exe process is created to execute the payload and\ntake part in the second stage of the attack chain.\n\n_msiexec manipulated to communicate with the C2 server._\n\nAfter a TCP connection is established with the C2 server, a payload Alg is downloaded to the\ninfected machine. This payload is a dropper for several files the malware uses in the second\nstage of the attack with msiexec.exe.\n\n_The malware being downloaded from the C2 server._\n\nThe full attack tree of the first phase is visible in the Cybereason Platform. This includes all\ninitial activity, including the attempt of the Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) to communicate\nwith the C2 server.\n\n_The infiltration of the malware as seen in the Cybereason Platform._\n\n## Phase Two: Deploying the Backdoor\n\nAfter Alg is downloaded, it is loaded as a binary with a .tmp extension to msiexec.exe and\nbegins to execute its sequence of malicious activity. This temporary file acts as the main\ndropper of the malware and the deployer of the malware across the target machine.\n\nWithin the .tmp file are three folders, which contain two modules pegas.dll and nsExec.dll as\nwell as a .nsi script.\n\nAccording to threat intel, NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a legitimate tool to\ncreate installers for Windows. This indicates the script is used to install something pertinent\nto the malware. It also allows the attack to evade detection, as it is a legitimate tool.\n\n_The content inside the temporary file._\n\nThe script contains commands for the .tmp to execute, and instructs the .tmp file to\nmanipulate and execute pegas.dll from a function kest()using the nsExec.dll module. This\nactivity is considered legitimate because NSIS scripts are legitimate by their nature.\n\n_The NSIS script_\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter being loaded and executed by msiexec.exe, the temporary file creates several\nadditional files. It creates another temporary file that will be loaded into the memory map of\nthe creator temporary file, but, more importantly, it creates two modules pegas.dll, and\nnsExec.dll.\n\n_The malware creates the file nsExec.dll._\n\n_The malware creates the file pegas.dll._\n\n[In addition, the temporary file also create a rundll32.exe process using the Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/rundll32)\ncommand line in order to load the dropped module pegas.dll and execute it from a function\n_kest()._\n\n_The execution command of rundll32.exe that will load pegas.dll._\n\nThe rundll32.exe process executes pegas.dll. These events were detected by the\nCybereason Defense Platform.\n\n_The malware deployment in the Cybereason Platform._\n\n## Functionality of Modules\n\n### nsExec.dll\n\n[The nsExec.dll module was created by Nullsoft, and is related to the NSIS installers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft)\nmentioned above. nsExec.dll will execute command-line-based programs and capture the\n[output without opening a DOSBox. This gives the attacker the ability to execute the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOSBox)\ncommand line and run the rundll32.exe process without appearing on the target machines\ndesktop. This increases the stealthiness of the malware when executing commands from the\nWindows command line.\n\n### pegas.dll\n\npegas.dll is the main module responsible for executing the full capabilities of the backdoor.\nThis includes the creation of malicious activity in the target machine, including\nreconnaissance, information stealing, and backdoor capabilities. In addition, this module is\nalso responsible for communicating with another C2 server that determines the next steps for\nthe malware. These steps are executed by the pegas.dll module.\n\nInterestingly, pegas.dll is actually a signed and verified module by certification company\nSectigo RSA Code Signing CA.This is very unusual, and is the mark of a sophisticated threat\nactor. This certificate company is also known for being used in the recent famous Norsk\n[Hydro LockerGoga Ransomware Attack from last month. This attack used their Sectigo](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://swimlane.com/blog/norsk-hydro-ransomware-attack/&sa=D&ust=1556137356175000)\ncertificate to propagate.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of this certificate gives the malware an advantage that most modern malware does\nnot have: legitimacy. Malware that is “confirmed” and “verified” will appear harmless, and\nmay lower the guard of security and IT specialists in an investigation. This shows that the\nthreat actors that developed this malware are more advanced than most malware authors.\n\n_The abused certificate._\n\npegas.dll makes use of several defense mechanisms. It is packed twice in order to ensure\nthat it is difficult to reverse-engineer. In addition, the module is compiled merely a few hours\nbefore the spear phishing attack occurs, which ensures it is quite new. Despite this, the\nCybereason Defense Platform was able to collect all the data associated with the module.\n\n_The malware packed twice._\n\nrundll32.exe executes the module pegas.dll from the function kest(). This function is one of\nseveral functions from the malware export table that is responsible for the initial execution of\nthe malicious code.\n\nThe other functions from the export table are loer()and tempora().\n\n_The three export functions._\n\nThese functions share similar functionality in terms of code and functions. All the variables\n_kest() contains also appear in tempora(). In addition, kest()and loer() share function_\n_FUN_12345f08(), which is essentially the only functionality loer() has._\n\n_The export functions pseudo-code in Ghidra._\n\n_FUN_12345f08() is one of the most important functions for the malware. The malware_\nauthors execute pegas.dll with kest() as soon as possible to make use of FUN_12345f08().\nWithin FUN_12345f08() there is a new indicator of compromise, a domain joisff333.icu that\nacts as the second C2 for the malware. This domain is reached from the rundll32.exe\nprocess. In addition, a string enu.ps1 appears, which indicates that this malware will use\nPowerShell. Lastly, a string asfasga33fafafaaf is also visible, which appears to be related to\nthe creation of the mutex BaseNamedObjects\\Global\\asfasga33fafafaaf.\n\n_FUN_13246F08 pseudo-code in Ghidra._\n\nUsing static investigation, additional indicative strings become visible that show some of the\nmalware capabilities including network ability, C2 commands, additional domains, and\nPowerShell execution activity.\n\n_Additional indicative strings from the unpacked malware._\n\n## Reconnaissance and Information Collection\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the execution of rundll32.exe, the PowerShell script enu.ps1 is executed. This script is\nencoded with Base64 in order to avoid detection by antivirus products.\n\n_enu.ps1 obfuscated using Base64._\n\nUpon decoding the script, it is clear that the script is responsible for gathering\n[reconnaissance on the target machine. This includes collecting information with WMI queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/wmisdk/wmi-start-page)\nto identify if the user is an administrator.\n\n_Internal reconnaissance by WMI queries._\n\nThe ServHelper backdoor gathers additional intel on the target machine including the users\nSID. An SID of S-1-5-32-544 is an identifier for the built-in Administrators group. This\nincludes the local administrator and all local and domain administrators user groups.\nGathering this information indicates two things: the malware authors are targeting\norganizations as opposed to regular home computer users, and within the organization they\nare targeting the highest priority user machines.\n\n_The malware searching for administrators users._\n\nOnce the malware confirms the target machine is an administrator group user, it collects\n[information from the method WindowsIdentity GetCurrent().](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.principal.windowsidentity.getcurrent?view=netframework-4.8)\n\n_The malware continuing to search for administrators users and collecting information on_\n_them._\n\nAfter the malware is able to verify this user is an administrator, it collects additional\ninformation about the target machine and retrieves data on all file system drives, including\nthe virtual drives\n\n_The malware collecting data about the system drives._\n\nThe last bit of information the script attempts to aggregate is the name of the server and the\nnames of the local groups on the computer. It uses net.exe, a legitimate Windows OS\nprocess, to collect this information.\n\n_Local group administrators reconnaissance._\n\nThe complete process tree of the deployment of the malware shows four different LOLBins\nthat took part in the attack cycle. Between the extensive use of LOLBins and the use of a\nsigned and verified module pegas.dll, it is clear the malware authors went to great lengths to\nevade detection.\n\n_Full process tree by process hacker._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Phase Three: The Dynamic C2 Server\n\nAfter deployment, the malware connects to a second C2 domain from rundll32.exe. The\nmalware makes use of multiple C2 domains to ensure there is at least one C2 server\navailable to attack from. It communicates with pegas.dll to decide the malware execution’s\nnext steps.\n\nThe second C2 server responds dependent on the information gathered on the target\nmachine. This is an indication of the level of sophistication of the malware. Whereas most\nmalware collects and sends data to a fixed C2 server, which responds the same regardless\nof the information, this takes on a more dynamic approach.\n\n_The malware communicates with its second C2 server._\n\n## Interaction with the Second C2 Server\n\nIn the process of communicating with the C2 domain, there are several key commands and\nactivities that the malware performs. Some of these activities are known from previous\nvariants seen in the wild.\n\n### Abusing Certifications\n\nThe following network activity observed from msiexec.exe illustrates how the malware\nleveraged a signed and verified certification from Sectigo RSA Code Signing CA to\npropagate.\n\n_Abusing certification traffic._\n\n### Executing Reconnaissance\n\nThe shell command is responsible for executing the net user /domain command on the target\nmachine. This command is a remote control command that allows the attacker to execute\nadditional reconnaissance activities.\n\n_Executing the net user /domain command._\n\n### The Persistence Mechanism\n\nThe persist command is responsible for the malware persistence mechanism on the target\nmachine. The C2 server decides whether to create persistence. This is another major\nindication of the sophistication of the malware, as the malware does not create persistence\non every target machine, but only does so on certain computers.\n\n_The C2 server informs the malware to create persistence._\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the persist command is sent by the C2 server, the malware creates persistence using\nthe registry. It creates a registry key Intel Protect under Run and store pegas.dll as the value.\n\n_Persistent mechanism._\n\n### Internal Reconnaissance\n\nThe malware changes its behavior based on the information it gathers from the infected\nmachine. This information is stored in the HTTP Payload, /URL: /jquery/jquery.php packet\nthat the infected machine delivers to the C2 domain.\n\nThe information is divided into four hardcoded parameters:\n\n_Key: the hardcoded parameter that stays the same in every iteration of the malware._\n_Sysid: the information about the operating system, service pack, and computer name._\n_Resp: the information about whether the user has administrator group privileges in the_\nactive directory.\n\n_Misc: additional information regarding the PowerShell file. This is the newest_\nparameter, and was observed only in this version of ServHelper. This includes\nadditional reconnaissance to help decide persistence.\n\n_Four hardcoded strings that will be used to deliver information to the C2 server._\n\nThe behavioral change in the malware’s response to the C2 domain is dependent on\nwhether the infected machine is a high priority target for the malware authors. When the\nmachine is not a valuable target, the Resp parameter will fill with, “the specified domain\neither does not exist or could not be contacted”.\n\n_The malware informs the C2 server about the findings (No AD admin)._\n\nIf the malware identifies that the target machine is valuable, it will fill the Resp parameter\nwith, “User accounts for testing.com [ׁ](The domain controller)” with the names the groups and\naccounts the machine has, such as, “Administrator”, along with the name of the user.\n\n_The malware informs the C2 server about the findings (With AD admin)._\n\nSimilar to many kinds of backdoor malware, ServHelper is able to lurk quietly in a sleep\nstate. This is a known backdoor characteristic that lets the malware stay under the radar and\nstrike at the exact time the attacker wants to activate additional malicious activities.\nServHelper gets information about the target machine date and time using the function\n[GetSystemTime().](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsystemtime)\n\n_The malware staying under the radar using the sleep function._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware contains several other commands known to be associated with ServHelper that\nappear in the strings mentioned above. This includes:\n\n_loaddl: a command responsible for downloading and executing additional modules_\nusing the rundll32.exe process.\n_selfkill: a command that is responsible for self-terminating and deleting the malware_\nfrom the machine.\n\nThe events that indicate the attempts to connect to the C2 server are identified by the\nCybereason Defense Platform.\n\n_The data exfiltration attempt within the Cybereason Platform._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThrough the evaluation of this malware, we discovered an evasive infection technique used\nto deploy the newest variant of the ServHelper Backdoor. We were able to detect and\nevaluate a targeted spear phishing attack conducted by the malware authors. This signals a\ncontinuation of an existing trend towards phishing attacks as an initial attack vector.\n\nIn this discovery, we highlighted the use of legitimate, native Windows OS processes used to\nperform malicious activities to deliver a payload without being detected, as well as how the\nServHelper Backdoor operates and deploys itself without being noticed. We also showed\nhow sophisticated this backdoor is, and how it specifically targets valuable machines and\nusers in order to maximize potential damage.\n\nThe analysis of the tools and techniques used in this ServHelper spear phishing attack show\nhow truly effective LOLBins are at evading antivirus products and how malware authors can\nmaximize the use of them. This furthers the trends [we have seen since 2018 with regards to](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/information-stealing-malware-targeting-brazil-full-research)\nLOLBins more common use. This research is an example of widespread LOLbin adoption,\nand shows that the use of LOLBins will only grow as we will continue through 2019.\n\nThe affected customer was able to contain the attack before any damage was done. The\nServHelper Backdoor was controlled, msiexec.exe and rundll32.exe were terminated, and all\nthe downloaded files were deleted. Furthermore, the connections to the malicious C2\ndomains were blocked and the attack was halted in its tracks.\n\nPart of the difficulty in identifying this attack is in how it evades detection. It is difficult to\ncatch, even for security teams aware of the complications in ensuring a secure system, as\nwith our customer. LOLBins are deceptive because their execution seems benign at first, or\neven sometimes safe. In addition, the use of a signed and verified file with certification\nincreases the likelihood that the malware will stay under the radar.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the use of LOLBins becomes more commonplace, we suspect this complex method of\nattack will become more widely used as well. The potential for damage will grow as attackers\nlook to other, more destructive payloads.\n\nLast month we discovered a new variant of the prolific Ursnif trojan.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n**SHA1**\n\n880b383532534e32f3fa49692d676d9488aabac1\n\n**SHA1**\n\n63aeb16b5d001cbd94b636e9f557fe97b8467c8d\n\n**SHA1**\n\nad35fa0b3799562931b4bfa3abd057214b8721ff\n\n**SHA1**\n\n06f232210e507f09f01155e7d0cb5389b8a31042\n\n\nHash Work report 011042019.xls\n\nHash Alg\n\nHash msie988.tmp\n\nHash pegas.dll\n\n\n79.141.171[.]160 IP First C2\n\naasdkkkdsa3442[.]icu Domain Second C2\n\njoisff333[.]icu Domain Second C2\n\nzxskjkkjsk3232[.]pw Domain Second C2\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout the Author\n\n**Cybereason Nocturnus**\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus Team has brought the world’s brightest minds from the military,\ngovernment intelligence, and enterprise security to uncover emerging threats across the\nglobe.
