Like the U.S.,\ncompanies in this region face a complex\nthreat landscape filled with advanced cyber\nattackers intent on stealing corporate data\nand state secrets.\n\nAdvanced persistent threat (APT) actors\nare one of the biggest challenges for the\nregion. Leading companies that do business\nin the energy, telecommunications, hightech, finance, and transportation sectors are\ntargets of APT groups.\n\n\nThis report describes malware detected at\ncommercial and government entities across\nSingapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,\nPhilippines, Indonesia, and Brunei. It also discusses\nadvanced threat groups behind many of these\nattacks and their unique motives in this region.\n\n\n###### THE MISSION IS TWO-FOLD:\n\n\nSteal intellectual\nproperty and inside\ninformation from\nleading companies.\n\n\nObtain intelligence on rival\ngovernments during longrunning political disputes,\nespecially those involving the\ndisputed South China Sea.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KEY FINDINGS\n\nDETECTING MALWARE ACROSS\nSOUTHEAST ASIA\n\n## 29%\n\nFrom July to December 2014, FireEye\nproducts helped 29 percent of our\ncustomers in Southeast Asia detect\nmalware used by APT groups and other\nactors targeting their networks.\n\n###### Detecting Targeted Threats in Southeast Asia and Beyond\nFrom July to December 2014, FireEye products\nhelped 29 percent of our customers in Southeast\nAsia detect malware used by APT groups and\nother attackers targeting their networks.

We\n\n### W\n\nbelieve that once stolen, this IP often makes its\nway to Chinese companies. These companies can\nuse the stolen IP to bypass years of research and\ndevelopment costs and get an inside edge when\nthey deal with competitors in the region.\n\nAs increasing investments and diversifying\neconomies spur development in the region, this\ngrowth simultaneously becomes even more\nattractive to APT groups.\n\nThese industry sectors appear to be most heavily targeted by APT groups:\n\n\nSoutheast Asia’s financial sector faces a dual\nthreat. First, standard cybercriminals are looking\nto steal money from them. Second, advanced\nthreat actors are seeking sensitive financial\ninformation for a business advantage.\n\n|ENERGY|TELECOMMUNICATIONS|HIGH-TECH|TRANSPORTATION|FINANCIAL SERVICES|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following table outlines some of the targeted sectors and why APT groups would target companies’ information:\n\n|Sector|Why are APT Groups Interested?|Recent Cases|Most Likely Corporate Targets|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Energy|APT groups have long targeted U.S. and multinational corporations with strong offerings in green technology and other clean energy production. R&D breakthroughs in this sector would provide tremendous value to China’s energy sector, especially in light of continued international pressure to lower emissions. Southeast Asia is an important potential source of hydrocarbon reserves. The disputed territories in the South China Sea are estimated to contain a considerable amount of natural gas and petroleum. As rapid economic growth creates a surge in energy demand, energy resources in the disputed maritime territories have become increasingly valuable. All of these factors are likely to provoke further APT activity.|FireEye has observed multiple instances of APT groups breaching the networks of regional energy companies. In one case, we discovered three different threat groups attempting to gain access to the network of an oil company that conducts offshore oil exploration. The threat groups appeared to target affiliates of the company, as well as its infrastructure development divisions. We believe these threat groups chiefly sought data of competitive value. But they were also on the lookout for any information about the company’s exploration plans and movements in the area.

More than half of the organizations we have observed being targeted or breached by APT5 operate in these sectors. Several times, APT5 has targeted organizations and personnel based in Southeast Asia. APT5 has been active since at least 2007. It appears to be a large threat group that consists of several subgroups, often with distinct tactics and infrastructure. APT5 has targeted or breached organizations across multiple industries, but its focus appears to be on telecommunications and technology companies, especially information about satellite communications.|APT5 targeted the network of an electronics firm that sells products for both industrial and military applications. The group subsequently stole communications related to the firm’s business relationship with a national military, including inventories and memoranda about specific products they provided. In one case in late 2014, APT5 breached the network of an international telecommunications company. The group used malware with keylogging capabilities to monitor the computer of an executive who manages the company’s relationships with other telecommunications companies. This method allowed APT5 to collect data on topics such as: • Pricing discussions, bidding strategies and competitor pricing information • Schedules for contract bidding and product deployment • Opportunities in Asian telecommunications market • Business opportunities with other telecommunications companies APT5 also targeted the networks of some of Southeast Asia’s major telecommunications providers with Leouncia malware. We suspect that the group sought access to these networks to obtain information that would enable it to monitor communications passing through the providers’ systems.|• Regional Telecommunication Providers • Asia-Based Employees of Global Telecommunications and Tech Firms • High-Tech Manufacturing • Military Application Technology|\n|||||\n|High-Tech||||\n|||||\n\n\n-----\n\n|Sector|Why are APT Groups Interested?|Recent Cases|Most Likely Corporate Targets|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Transportation|APT groups likely target the region’s transportation companies to monitor the progress of high-profile projects that have the potential to fuel continued economic growth in the region.|In one case, a threat group that has historically focused its operations on targets in the Philippines and Malaysia spoofed the domain names of two well-known international shipping companies. One of the spoofed companies was a major commercial freight company that transports commodities around the globe. The other was a regional shipbuilding company. The plausible URLs were designed to entice potential victims within targeted industries to click. Another APT group targeted a major operator of container ship terminals in Southeast Asia. We suspect the group targeted the port operator to monitor its communications with regional security and military organizations that partner with the company. A threat group targeted a rail operator. We detected variants of the Lecna/BackSpace APT malware in the transit company’s networks in early 2014.|• Shipping Companies • Port Operators • Airlines • Public Transit Systems|\n|||||\n\n\n-----\n\n|Sector|Why are APT Groups Interested?|Recent Cases|Most Likely Corporate Targets|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Financial Services|Banks in Southeast Asia appear to face a double threat. The first is the pernicious cybercrime activity we observe around the world, such as credit card fraud and the theft of banking credentials. The second threat is focused specifically on banks with a development mission in the region.|In one case, a threat group targeted a development bank that invests in the growth of strategic projects and industries in the region. In another instance, we saw two different threat groups infect the networks of a central bank. Stolen data on the country’s monetary policies and banking system could be highly valuable information to someone looking to understand and anticipate broader banking and funding trends in the country and region.|• Banks • Companies Funding Major Regional Development Projects • Institutions Dealing With Monetary Policy|\n|||||\n\n\n###### Banks that invest in the region’s strategic growth face more threats than traditional credit card fraud and financial hackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND MILITARIES: IN APT GROUPS’ CROSSHAIRS\n\n|Col1|SOUTH CHINA SEA|BRUNEI|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n|||MALAYSIA INDONESIA|\n\n\nhe APT groups that we track actively target\ngovernments and militaries for inside\ninformation into negotiations and political\n\n### T\n\nissues.

It contains potential reserves of up to\n11 billion barrels of oil, 190 trillion cubic feet of\nnatural gas, and prime fishing areas.\n\nTerritorial disputes have lingered for decades.\nAlong with militaries and coast guards of claimant\ncountries, South China Sea disputes involve\nregional oil firms, cargo companies, and fisheries.\nThe territory has been at the center of many\ninternational incidents, reflecting the considerable\nnational and economic security implications for\nthe rival claimants.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Government and military entities are frequently targeted with malware that steals sensitive security details.\n\n Threat Groups Target Southeast Asian Governments and Militaries over Territorial Claims\nSoutheast Asian government and military entities\nhave been targeted several times in what we\nsuspect are efforts to obtain intelligence related\nto territorial disputes.\n\n             - An APT group stole data from one country’s\n\ngovernment and military networks on several\noccasions, including a period of heightened\ntension over competing claims in the South\nChina Sea.[1]\n\nSome of the files that the APT group took\nincluded the following:\n\n–– General military documents\n–– Internal communications\n–– Equipment maintenance reports and\nspecifications\n–– Event-related materials\n–– Documentation of organizational\nprograms and initiatives\n\n              - Other threat groups have targeted a country’s\n\nair force with spear-phishing emails that\nreferenced the country’s military and regional\nmaritime disputes. These emails were designed\nto appear to originate from email accounts\nassociated with other elements of the military.\n\n\n\n- Other threat actors have used the Grillmark\n\nbackdoor to attempt to gain access to the\nnetworks of two countries’ government and\nmilitary entities. These threat actors targeted\ntheir victims through spear-phishing emails\nthat contained weaponized documents relating\nto either diplomatic or military affairs.\n\n###### APT Groups Gather\n Political Intelligence\nIn August 2014, an APT group appeared to\ntarget intelligence related to a Southeast Asia\ngovernment. The threat actors sent a spearphishing email that referenced the country’s\nleadership and contained a document with\nsections extracted from related news articles.\nThe email appeared to originate from a\ncompromised intelligence agency email account,\nalthough the threat actors may have faked the\nemail address. Many of the email’s recipients\nwere associated with the targeted country’s\ngovernment and military or were involved in intelsharing partnerships. In either case, the recipient\nwould likely have access to information regarding\nthe country’s security and internal stability.\n\n\n1 Whaley, Floyd. “A Leviathan Turns Philippine Fishermen into Desperate Darters.” The New York Times. 18 May 2014.
