Active since at least 2014, this actor has long-standing interest in maritime industries, naval\ndefense contractors, and associated research institutions in the United States and Western Europe.\n\nKey takeaways from this research include:\n\nIndustry targeting: The actor targets defense contractors, universities (particularly those with military research\nties), legal organizations [3] and government agencies [3]. The actor has particular interest in naval industries\nincluding shipbuilding and related research\nGeographical targeting: Targeting includes United States, Western Europe, and South China Sea\nTools: Custom JavaScript [malware known as “Orz” and “NanHaiShu”, Cobalt Strike, the SeDll JavaScript](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\nloader, and MockDll dll loader\nDelivery: Emailed attachments and URLs, often employing a fraudulent lookalike domain and stolen branding\nExploitation: Microsoft Excel and Word documents with macros (sometimes password-protected), very recent\n[vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-0199 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0199) [CVE-2017-8759, and malicious Microsoft Publisher files](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8759)\nInstallation: JavaScript, JavaScript Scriptlets in XML, HTA, PowerShell, WMI, regsvr32, Squiblydoo\nLateral Movement: The actor sometimes utilizes access at one compromised organization to attack the next.\nFor example, compromised email accounts at one organization were used to send the next wave of malicious\nattachments to potential victims in the same industry. Similarly the actor attempts to compromise servers within\nvictim organizations and use them for command and control (C&C) for their malware.\n\nThis blog traces key activities connected to this actor and examines a number of their tools and techniques.\nCampaigns and details are presented in reverse chronological order to highlight the group’s most recent activities.\n\n**Delivery and Exploitation**\n\n_September 2017_\n\n[On September 15 and 19, 2017, Proofpoint detected and blocked spearphishing emails from this group targeting a](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spear-phishing)\nUS shipbuilding company and a US university research center with military ties. Example emails used the subject\n“Apply for internship position” and contained an attachment “resume.rtf”. Another attachment,\n“ARLUAS_FieldLog_2017-08-21.doc” contained a “Torpedo recovery experiment” lure. The attachments exploited\nCVE-2017-8759 which was discovered and documented only five days prior to the campaign [1].\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Example attachment resume.rtf from September 2017 campaign_\n\n_August 2017_\n\nBetween August 2 and 4, the actor sent targeted spearphishing emails containing malicious URLs linking to\ndocuments to multiple defense contractors. Some of this activity was documented and observed by a fellow\nresearcher [2]. Many of the documents, C&C domains, and payload domains abused the brand of a major provider of\nships, submarines, and other vessels with military applications. Some of the documents exploited CVE-2017-0199 to\ndeliver the payload.\n\n_Figure 2: One of the documents involved in the campaign used Microsoft licensing lures purporting to be from a well-_\n_known shipbuilder (sha256: 6f6ee01e9dc2d8c4c260ef4131fe88dc152e53ee8afd3e66e92d4e1bf5fd2e92)._\n\nOther documents were Microsoft Publisher files that relied on social engineering. The potential victims were lured\ninto starting an embedded PowerPoint presentation, moving the mouse to trigger execution of an embedded\nJavaScript [5], and then pressing “Enable” in a warning dialog to cause the payload download. The Publisher files\nwere poorly crafted, relied on multiple user interactions, and contained multiple grammatical and typographic errors.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Publisher document delivered via a link in email is in Italian, and is a simple reuse of a student’swork._\n\n_February 2015_\n\nFrom February to October of 2015, our colleagues at F-Secure and McAfee reported on campaigns [3][4] by this\nactor targeting South China Sea interests. During this time, the group utilized Microsoft Excel and Word documents\nwith macros to target the Philippines Department of Justice, APEC organizers, and an international law firm.\nTargeting of these companies is different from that which we typically observe for this actor; however it still centers\naround marine and naval issues as related to South China sea politics.\n\n_Figure 4: Example attachment “DOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015.xls”. Similar to this document attachment, most of_\n_the attachments in this campaign did not contain meaningful content_\n\n_November 2014_\n\nThe period between November 2014 and January 2015 marked one of the earlier instances in which Proofpoint\nobserved persistent exploitation attempts by this actor. The actor generally emailed Microsoft Excel documents with\nmalicious macros to US universities with military interests, most frequently related to the Navy. The actor also\noccasionally used macro-laden Microsoft Word documents to target other US research and development\norganizations with military and intelligence ties during this period.\n\nEmails were often very simple with a greeting and an attachment. On other occasions, it appears that the attackers\nused highly topical lures based on current events or legitimate documents stolen from previous victims. Lure topics\nincluded symposia, the Navy, IT, and relevant research.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Example Excel attachment “2014 Accomplishments Input Template.xls”_\n\n**Installation**\n\nThe actor continues to:\n\nInnovate and modify the code that accomplishes the installation, while the backdoor code remains more static\nUse scripting languages such as JavaScript, JavaScript Scriptlets, VBScript, and XML\nUse simple obfuscation such as base64, gzip compression, and insertion of garbage characters\nSplit functionality of the backdoor & code that establishes persistence for the backdoor into separate files and\nscripts\n\n_Example 1: Resume.rtf_\n\nThe “resume.rtf” file from the September 19, 2017 attack retrieves the malicious SOAP WSDL definition named\n“readme.txt “ using an anonymous FTP logon to the attacker’s server.\n\n_Figure 6: SOAP WSDL definition (“readme.txt “)_\n\nThis definition in turn downloads a VBScript favicon.ico file, which then creates and runs two JavaScript files in the\n%TMP% directory:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Code snipped showing VBScript dropping 2 JavaScript files_\n\nThe job of the smaller of the two JavaScripts is to establish a system autostart mechanism. It accomplishes this by\ndeobfuscating another script, link.js, into %TMP%. Link.js in turn creates a shortcut file \"Java(TM) Platform SE Auto\nUpdater.lnk\" in the \"Startup\" special folder pointing to the main backdoor JavaScript.\n\n_Figure 8: Code for establishing persistence after reboot (autostart mechanism)_\n\nThe job of the larger of the two JavaScripts is to download and execute the Cobalt Strike payload. It accomplishes\nthis by writing more code to rWug5n0PHUFjDFyb8k.js in the temporary directory, which then runs a PowerShell\ncommand (obfuscated using garbage characters, base64 encoding, and Gzip compression). The PowerShell is a\ndefault Cobalt Strike downloader.\n\n_Figure 9: PowerShell code downloading Cobalt Strike_\n\n_Example 2: Malicious Microsoft Publisher document_\n\nThe malicious script executed by the Microsoft Publisher file downloads and runs yet another JavaScript file, 0.js,\nhosted on the attacker-controlled server:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Malicious script executed by the Microsoft Publisher file (sha256:_\n_305f331bfb1e97028f8c92cbcb1dff2741dcddacc76843e65f9b1ec5a66f52bc)_\n\nSimilar to the previous example (resume.rtf), the 0.js handles the system autostart mechanism via a shortcut file\n\"office 365.lnk\" in the \"Startup\" special folder. However, the shortcut abuses the “Squiblydoo” technique [6].\nMoreover, the backdoor is not run directly but via an intermediary SeDll (see below).\n\n0.js also downloads two additional files from the C&C server (green.ddd and green.tmp) The first of these files,\ngreen.ddd, is an executable file internally named “SEDll_Win32.dll”. This is a known backdoor used by this actor\nsince 2014 for the same purpose: decrypting and executing the final JavaScript backdoor “Orz”.\n\n**Tools**\n\n_NanHaiShu_\n\nWe have observed variants of this JavaScript backdoor used in various campaigns, including those publically\nreported. The actor continues to improve and refine the malware by, for example, wrapping it inside an HTA wrapper.\nSeveral good descriptions are available in analyses from fellow researchers [3][4]. Basic functionality includes:\n\nInformation gathering (computer name, user name, serial number, proxy server)\nDownloading from URL\nExecuting other JavaScript\nRegistry, system, process, directory, file operations\nSafeIE (change IE settings to reduce warnings about about malware activity)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Screenshot from 2015 version of the malware dropped by “DOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015.xls”_\n\n_Orz_\n\nWe observed this backdoor in an August 2017 campaign dropped by the Microsoft Publisher files, as well as much\nearlier in 2014. We named it due to a variable name “orz”, which is changed to “core” in the more recent version. The\nactor consistently tweaks and improves this backdoor as well. The backdoor is a fairly involved script malware. Its\nfunctionality includes:\n\nInformation gathering (IE version, OS version, OS 64-bit/32-bit, etc)\nOverwriting registry settings to reduce malware visibility on system\nDownload file\nUpload file\nExecute a command with cscript\nExecute JavaScript\nExecute shell command\nExecute a dll (via an embedded ‘MockDll')\nGet proxy info\nGet process list\nTerminate process\nGet drive info\nGET request to a URL\nPOST request to a URL\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: Snippet of the Orz backdoor code delivered by the the Microsoft Publisher document. The URL domain is_\n_a fraudulent lookalike domain._\n\nThere is an extensive configuration section at the top of the script. The \"jmpUrlList\" provides the initial C&C servers,\nwhich are used to determine the secondary C&C server as well as additional commands to execute. It is worth noting\nthat the secondary C&C may be the same as the first. We have observed attacker-controlled web servers,\ncompromised victim web servers, and Technet and Pastebin web pages used for the initial C&C.\n\nThe initial C&C response is parsed with a regex. The backdoor first looks for the secondary encoded C&C server\nusing the \"jmpRegex\" regex. Next, the backdoor looks for additional code to execute using the \"codeRegex\" regex.\nFor additional code, we observed simple code blocks that provide a different upload/download functionality.\n\n_Figure 13: The encoded response \"vcmQx3ELgTyTyOVSvsm7wrBKwraFw8VFwCuL\" in the image above decodes to_\n_\"hxxp://www.vitaminmain[.]info\" which is the secondary C&C server for an older backdoor variant (Decoder provided_\n_in Appendix)._\n\n\n-----\n\n_MockDll_\n\nSome versions of the Orz backdoor have 32- and 64-bit embedded DLLs, stored internally as base64 strings. Their\npurpose is to simply run another binary. These are used as loaders for future executable payloads, using the wellknown process hollowing technique. To use the MockDll, the backdoor creates a configuration .ini file like that shown\nin Figure 14:\n\n_Figure 14: MockDll configuration file_\n\nmock: defaults to 'regsvr32'\n\nreal: the dll, which is the ultimate goal to execute\n\nargs: arguments to the dll that will be executed, if any\n\noutf: file in which to write results of the MockDll run\n\ntime: timeout defaults to 5\n\nAfter the configuration file is created, the MockDll is executed with regsvr32. MockDll reads the mentioned .ini config\nfile to determine what to execute. It can log its execution results into a file specified by the “outf” parameter, as\nshown in Figure 15:\n\n_Figure 15: Contents of the log file created by MockDll_\n\n_SeDll_\n\nThis DLL is used for decrypting and executing another JavaScript backdoor such as Orz. The DLL is registered by\nthe installer using regsvr32. The DllRegisterServer export is then called, which performs checks on the commandline\nparameter. If the string “DR” is passed as an argument, or if the DLL is running in the active session with a username\nthat is not “system”, the final JavaScript backdoor is decoded using a custom base64 alphabet. This backdoor has to\nbe present in the same directory as the dll, with a “.tmp” file extension. The backdoor script is then executed using\nthe IActiveScript and IActiveScriptParse32 COM interfaces.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Decoding and executing of the JavaScript backdoor_\n\nIf those conditions are not met, it runs the following command line “\"regsvr32 /s \\\"%s\\\" DR __CIM__\"” to register the\nDLL, where %s is the path to the DLL. It tries to do this with the current user privileges, but if the privileges cannot be\nadjusted it defaults to the available execution environment.\n\n_Cobalt Strike_\n\nThis is a penetration testing tool. The attackers often abuse the free trial version.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis actor, whose espionage activities primarily focus on targets in the US and Western Europe with military ties, has\nbeen active since at least 2014. The tools, techniques, and targets consistently connect their work, particular given\ntheir attention to naval and maritime defense interests and use of custom backdoors. While defense contractors and\nacademic research centers with military ties should always be cognizant of the potential for cyberattacks,\norganizations fitting their targeting profiles should be especially wary of legitimate-looking but unsolicited emails from\noutside entities. Appropriate layered defenses at the firewall, email gateway, and endpoint can all help prevent the\nkinds of lateral movement we have observed with this actor, as well as the compromise and abuse of systems via\nwhich this group expands its attack surface to other organizations.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/zero-day-used-to-distribute-finspy.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/zero-day-used-to-distribute-finspy.html)\n\n[2] [https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box/status/893525493059788800](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box/status/893525493059788800)\n\n[3] [https://labsblog.f-secure.com/2016/08/04/nanhaishu-rating-the-south-china-sea/](https://labsblog.f-secure.com/2016/08/04/nanhaishu-rating-the-south-china-sea/)\n\n[4] https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1028936-stealthy-cyberespionage-campaign-attacks-with-socialengineering\n\n[5] [http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mouseover-otlard-gootkit/](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mouseover-otlard-gootkit/)\n\n[6] https://www.carbonblack.com/2016/04/28/threat-advisory-squiblydoo-continues-trend-of-attackers-using-nativeos-tools-to-live-off-the-land/\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n-----\n\ncdf6e2e928a89cbb857e688055a25e37a8d8b8b90530bd52c8548fb544f66f1f SHA256 Resume.rtf exploiting\nCVE-2017-8759 (Sep 19,\n2017)\n\nc7fa6f27ec4f4142ae591f2dd7c63d046431945f03c87dbed88d79f55180a46d SHA256 ARLUAS_FieldLog_201708-21.doc exploiting\nCVE-2017-8759 (Sep 19,\n2017)\n\nftp://185.106.120[.]206/pub/readme.txt URL Resume.rtf downloading\nscripts (Sep 19, 2017)\n\nhxxp://185.106.120[.]206/favicon.ico URL Resume.rtf downloading\nscripts (Sep 19, 2017)\n\n39c952c7e14b6be5a9cb1be3f05eafa22e1115806e927f4e2dc85d609bc0eb36 SHA256 Favicon.ico (Sep 19,\n2017)\n\n5860ddc428ffa900258207e9c385f843a3472f2fbf252d2f6357d458646cf362 SHA256 Cobalt Strike (Sep 19,\n2017)\n\nced7ca9625543d3d3d09f70223cc19f0d99e21792854452df5ba84b3a59d17b8 SHA256 20170720_final_pm_app2.doc (August\n2017)Document hash\n(August 2017)\n\n305f331bfb1e97028f8c92cbcb1dff2741dcddacc76843e65f9b1ec5a66f52bc SHA256 Publisher hash (August\n2017)\n\nbfc5c6817ff2cc4f3cd40f649e10cc9ae1e52139f35fdddbd32cb4d221368922 SHA256 MockDll 32-bit (August\n2017)\n\n80b931ab1798d7d8a8d63411861cee07e31bb9a68f595f579e11d3817cfc4aca SHA256 MockDll 32-bit (August\n2017)\n\n146aa9a0ec013aa5bdba9ea9d29f59d48d43bc17c6a20b74bb8c521dbb5bc6f4 SHA256 green.ddd SeDll (August\n2017)\n\n4029b43c7febd05e8bf013c1022244aaa238341ca44bbce2250667614c1a4932 SHA256 2014 Accomplishments\nInput Template.xls\n(December 2014)\n\nhxxp://www.vitaminmain[.]info URL Orz secondary C2\n(December 2014)\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Coverage**\n\n2024192 | ET EXPLOIT Possible CVE-2017-0199 HTA Inbound\n\n2024196 | ET WEB_CLIENT HTA File containing Wscript.Shell Call -
