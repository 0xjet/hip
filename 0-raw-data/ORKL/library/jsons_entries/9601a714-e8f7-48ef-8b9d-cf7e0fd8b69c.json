By and large, this is a fairly simple cryptor. What is interesting in this case is the\npurpose for which attackers are using it.\n\n## HermeticRansom goals\n\n\n-----\n\nHermeticRansom attacked computers at the same time as another malware known as\nHermeticWiper, and based on publicly available information from security community, it was\nused in recent cyberattacks in Ukraine. According to our experts, the relative simplicity and\nquestionable malware workflow implementation suggests that HermeticRansom was used as\na smokescreen for HermeticWiper attacks.\n\n## What HermeticRansom is capable of\n\nOnce infecting the victim’s computer, the malware first identifies hard drives and collects a\nlist of directories and files located everywhere except for the Windows and Program Files\nfolders. It then encrypts certain categories of files and renames them adding а .encrypted tag\nand the email address of the ransomware operators. The malware also creates a\nread_me.html file in the Desktop folder containing a ransom note with the attackers’\ncontacts. The note looks like this:\n\nRansom note left by HermeticRansom malware\n\nHermeticRansom encrypts files with following extensions: .inf, .acl, .avi, .bat, .bmp, .cab, .cfg,\n.chm, .cmd, .com, .crt, .css, .dat, .dip, .dll, .doc, .dot, .exe, .gif, .htm, .ico, .iso, .jpg, .mp3,\n.msi and odt.\n\n## HermeticRansom peculiarities\n\nHermeticRansom is written in Golang. It does not use any obfuscation mechanisms, and the\nencryption method itself is rather cumbersome and inefficient. Judging by these and some\nother signs, our experts think that this malware was created in a hurry.\n\nYou can find a more detailed technical analysis of the malware along with indicators of\n[compromise on our Securelist blog.](https://securelist.com/elections-goransom-and-hermeticwiper-attack/105960/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## How to stay safe\n\nKaspersky Lab security solutions successfully detect HermeticRansom malware and similar\nthreats.
