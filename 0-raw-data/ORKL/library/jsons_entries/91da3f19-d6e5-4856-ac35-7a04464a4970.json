It’s in active development,](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/who-is-agent-tesla/)\nconstantly being updated and improved with new features, obfuscation, and encryption\nmethods. The malware is sold as a service with a relatively cheap licensing model, which\nmakes it particularly easy to use and can explain its distribution on such a wide scale. At the\ntime of writing two versions of Agent Tesla can still be found in the wild – version 2 and 3.\nVersion 3 comes with some updates and additional features and is currently the most\nprevalent.\n\nAgent Tesla’s most common and successful delivery method is through email, either in the\n[form of spam or more targeted campaigns (OPEC+,](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/04/oil-gas-spearphishing-campaigns-drop-agent-tesla-spyware-in-advance-of-historic-opec-deal/) [COVID-19,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/covid-19-themed-cyber-attacks-target-government-and-medical-organizations/) [ISPS), where the malware is](https://cofense.com/strategic-analysis-agent-tesla-expands-targeting-and-networking-capabilities/)\nbundled as an attachment, usually in the form of a document or a compressed archive\n(Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: VMRay Analyzer – Email delivering Agent Tesla (left) and the email displayed in an_\n_email client (right)._\n\n[In the following Threat Bulletin, we’ll explore the delivery process of an Agent Tesla sample](https://www.vmray.com/cyber-security-blog/tag/threat-bulletin/)\nand some of the differences and similarities between different versions of Agent Tesla. With\nthat in mind, we begin by looking into a fairly recent sample of Agent Tesla (v3) delivered as\nan email attachment (Figure 1).\n\n## Agent Tesla – Initial Stages\n\nThe email arrives with an attachment posing as an invoice with the .doc extension but is\nactually an RTF document. When it’s opened, it exploits CVE-2017-11882 to execute further\nstages. The shellcode used in the exploitation of the Equation Editor (eqnedt32.exe) is\n\n\n-----\n\nresponsible for downloading and executing the next stage (Figure 2).\n\n[View the VMRay Analyzer Report for Agent Tesla v3 (INVOICE-6754.doc.rtf)](https://www.vmray.com/analyses/teslav3cmstp/report/overview.html)\n\n_Figure 2: VMRay function log of the Equation Editor process downloading the next stage_\n_(top) and a VTI depicting document creating other processes (bottom)._\n\nInterestingly, with this delivery, the threat actors leverage the [CMSTP.exe to launch further](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmstp)\nstages (Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3: Abusing CMSTP to launch further stages._\n\n\n-----\n\nCMSTP is usually used to install Connection Manager service profiles. It takes an .INF file s\npath as argument. It describes the profile’s characteristics and the steps to be taken when\ninstalling it. This can be abused to start another executable by a legitimate, signed binary or\n[used as a UAC bypass. It’s one of the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/003/) [Living Off The Land techniques. In this case, the .INF](https://www.vmray.com/resource/sans-webcast-dissecting-living-off-the-land-techniques/)\n[file itself seems to have been taken from a public example (by Tyler Applebaum) (Figure 4).](https://gist.github.com/tylerapplebaum/ae8cb38ed8314518d95b2e32a6f0d3f1#file-uacbypass-inf)\nIt extends the installation with a RunPreSetupCommandsSection which allows one to run\ncommands before the profile is installed. The malicious actor leverages this to run the\nmalware.\n\n_Figure 4: .INF file passed to CMSTP.exe as an argument._\n\nDuring the following steps of the execution, we observe how Agent Tesla makes sure that it’s\nnot easily discovered by adding its image path as an exclusion for Windows Defender\n(Figure 5). Additionally, it also disables the UAC dialog by overwriting the corresponding\nsettings in the registry. Doing this, the user won’t be notified or prompted for permission if an\nelevated (requiring administrator access token) action is taken. Thus, Agent Tesla is silently\ninstalled.\n\n_Figure 5: Defense evasion methods of the loader._\n\nFinally, the actual Agent Tesla payload is extracted and injected using the process hollowing\nmethod (Figure 6). We have observed many samples using this approach however there\n[were also cases using .NET in-memory reflective loading or a similar method. The process of](https://blog.f-secure.com/detecting-malicious-use-of-net-part-1/)\n\n\n-----\n\ndelivering and loading Agent Tesla varies greatly but the actual payload has many similarities\neven between versions.\n\n_Figure 6: Agent Tesla’s loader using process hollowing._\n\n### Agent Tesla – Execution Flow\n\nEven though Agent Tesla has been in development for at least 7 years, the overall execution\nflow hasn’t changed much. Some new features were added to the newer versions of Agent\nTesla, but the behavior has remained fairly similar. The following section summarizes the\nhigh-level execution steps it usually performs. In some cases, we have observed that the\norder changes slightly but it doesn’t impact the behavior. It also highlights additions made in\nthe newer version of Agent Tesla (v3).\n\nAt the beginning of its execution, Agent Tesla often uses certain methods to evade automatic\nanalyses. Some of the common evasion techniques include the introduction of an execution\ndelay, which can evade sandboxes that have a limited monitoring duration, and checking the\nuser and computer name for certain hard-coded values that could indicate it’s being\nanalyzed (Figure 7). The spyware also makes sure that no other processes with the same\nname are currently running. It iterates over all processes with the same name and kills any\nwhich aren’t the current process.\n\nEach infected system is identified by a unique ID generated from different hardware\ninformation. There are different ways Agent Tesla can achieve this. It applies the MD5\nhashing algorithm on a string created by concatenating different hardware properties:\n\nSystem Serial Number,\nCPU identification value retrieved from the processorID property of the\n[Win32_Processor WMI management class,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/retrieving-a-class)\nThe MAC address is taken from the MACAddress property of the\nWin32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration WMI class. It takes the MAC address of a\nnetwork adapter that is currently connected.\n\nThe hardware ID is generated at the beginning of the execution but appears to be only used\nduring the HTTP communication.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother common evasion between versions, that Agent Tesla uses at the beginning of its\nexecution, is the [GetLastInputInfo function. If no input event was detected in the last 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getlastinputinfo)\nminutes a configuration variable is set (Figure 7).\n\n_Figure 7: Agent Tesla’s last input detection (top) and user/computer name detection (bottom)._\n\nIts next step is usually to copy itself to a less obvious location (an installation folder) like\n%appdata% which is also configurable and might not be used at all. The config file also\nindicates if the file should have the hidden and system attributes set. Persistence is achieved\nby installing itself as a startup application in the registry. In this case, Agent Tesla also\n\n\n-----\n\nenables the corresponding startup entry via\n\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\StartupApproved\\Run by setting the\nvalue 02 00 00 00 00 00 (Figure 8).\n\n_Figure 8: Agent Tesla’s persistence via Registry._\n\nFurthermore, it also deletes the ZoneIdentifier from the base image. A ZoneIdentifier is an\nAlternate Data Stream created (when a file is downloaded and saved from the internet). This\ninformation is used by Windows and various security products. Deleting it makes the\nmalware look as if it wasn’t downloaded from the internet. Depending on the configuration\nAgent Tesla is able to take screenshots periodically. It uses a timer that will invoke the\nregistered callback function according to a specified interval which is also configurable. One\ndifference between versions is in the choice of protocols the malware can use to exfiltrate the\ncollected information. Version 2 and 3 are both capable of using HTTP, SMTP, and FTP. On\ntop of that, v3 comes with another possibility which is sending a document to a Telegram\nchannel (Figure 9).\n\n_Figure 9: Example configuration of Agent Tesla using Telegram as C2 (left) and screenshot_\n_functionality of a v3 that can use Telegram (right)._\n\n\n-----\n\nA new addition that came with Agent Tesla v3 is the ability to collect clipboard data and the\nexternal IP of the infected host (Figure 10).\n\n[View the VMRay Analyzer Report for Agent Tesla v3 (External IP Check)](https://www.vmray.com/analyses/agentteslav3/report/overview.html)\n\n_Figure 10: Agent Tesla v3 checking external IP._\n\nFurthermore, v3 comes with the option to use the Tor proxy for its HTTP communication.\nThis is a newer addition which isn’t found in the previous versions (Figure 11). If the\ncorresponding configuration is set, Agent Tesla first tries to kill all currently running Tor\ninstances and then download and set up the Tor client.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Agent Tesla with the Tor proxy option (v3) (left) and Agent Tesla without Tor proxy_\n_v2 (right)._\n\nWith HTTP communication set-up, Agent Tesla starts one of its main tasks – credentialstealing (Figure 12). Agent Tesla v3 has some additions to the application list that it targets.\n\n_Figure 12: Agent Tesla’s Stealing attempts._\n\nBoth versions are also able to function as a keylogger. The keylogging functionality is again\nimplemented with the help of timers. The set interval specifies how often the logs are\ncollected and exfiltrated (Figure 13). The hook itself is installed using the native\nSetWindowsHookExA function with idHook WH_KEYBOARD_LL which takes an applicationdefined hook.\n\n_Figure 13: Keyboard log exfiltration (left) and hook installation (right)._\n\n### String and Config Decryption\n\n\n-----\n\nAll strings that are used by Agent Tesla are encrypted by default and mostly used on\ndemand. The ability to decrypt Agent Tesla’s strings, allows one to extract parts of the\nconfiguration information like the c2 server, the passwords used, or other data related to\nnetwork connections. Appendix B contains a small list of extracted network information from\ndifferent Agent Tesla samples.\n\n**Version 2**\nAgent Tesla v2’s encrypted strings are usually located in the .text segment of the PE file. To\nbe exact, they start 0x50 bytes past the beginning of the section. The strings are encrypted\nusing AES in CBC mode (Figure 14). Each string is encrypted with its own Key and IV.\nStrings are stored in an array of objects, where each object is an array of units. The\ndecryption routine takes an encoded offset into the array which is then decoded at runtime to\nextract the corresponding string.\n\n_Figure 14: Agent Tesla v2 string decryption routine._\n\nInvestigating the object in dnSpy shows that the static object array corresponds to the token\n0x04000001 (Figure 15 left). It describes the Field table (0x4) and its first row (0x000001).\nEach element in the array is described by its own token (Figure 15 right). dnSpy already\nprovides us with the corresponding RVA and file offset. However, this information can also be\nextracted manually from the FieldRVA table in the metadata stream of the PE file by looking\nup the corresponding row number. This information would allow to statically parse the file\nand its metadata, extract the RVAs and decrypt the strings without assuming any offsets.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15: Encrypted strings as shown in dnSpy (left) and the metadata of each element_\n_(right)._\n\n**Version 3**\n\nAgent Tesla v3 changes how the strings are encrypted. AES is no longer used for decryption.\nInstead, the encrypted strings are stored in a byte array which is decrypted by XORing the\nvalue with the current array offset and a hard-coded key. This decryption takes place when\nthe class is constructed, i.e., the array and the decryption loop (Figure 16 left) are\nimplemented inside a class constructor. The decrypted strings are stored without any\nseparators as a single blob of characters. When a particular string is required, a function that\ntakes the offset and length of the string as parameters is used (Figure 16 right). This also\nmeans that it’s harder to statically extract information from the strings and requires, e.g.,\nparsing of the actual decoding function wherever it’s used and extracting its arguments.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: String decryption in a class constructor (top) and example decoding function_\n_(bottom)._\n\n### Conclusions\n\nUnderstanding a malware family, its usual delivery methods, and the techniques used can be\nvery beneficial from an incident response standpoint. The research of a family can give the\nblue team enough information to start an internal investigation if a breach is suspected. They\ncan better assess the initial impact of such a breach, can look for indicators and start their\ninitial analysis from there and expand outwards.\n\n###
