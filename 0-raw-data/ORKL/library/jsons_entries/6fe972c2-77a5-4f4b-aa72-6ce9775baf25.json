This Researcher Has a Plan to Change That\n\n**[therecord.media/cyber-attribution-is-more-art-than-science-this-researcher-has-a-plan-to-change-that/](https://therecord.media/cyber-attribution-is-more-art-than-science-this-researcher-has-a-plan-to-change-that/)**\n\nFebruary 19, 2021\n\n[Adam Janofsky](https://therecord.media/author/adam/)\nFebruary 19, 2021\n\nWhen Timo Steffens got his first job in threat intelligence more than a decade ago, with\nGermany’s Federal Office for Information Security, or BSI, he had only a passing knowledge\nof advanced persistent threat groups and other hacking concepts that he’s now an expert in.\n\nHis background was in artificial intelligence, and the agency, which is responsible for the\nGerman government’s cybersecurity, was working on an early warning system to detect\ncomputer worms. Before his interview, he read through two books on cybersecurity, which\n[sparked a passion for hunting down adversaries. Since then, he’s written his own book on](https://www.amazon.com/Attribution-Advanced-Persistent-Threats-cyber-espionage/dp/3662613123/ref=mp_)\nhow to identify advanced persistent threat actors behind notorious cyber espionage\ncampaigns.\n\nThe Record caught up with Steffens recently to talk about the latest in threat hunting, and\nwhy he thinks it’s similar to disciplines like art history and criminology. He also discussed why\nthe whole concept of APT groups—the term security professionals often use to categorize\n\n\n-----\n\nnation state or state-sponsored hacking operations—is a simplification that the industry might\nhave to move past. The conversation below has been lightly edited for space and clarity.\n\nTimo Steffens\n\n**The Record: What’s the benefit of attribution? What can be gained from knowing who**\n**attacked you?**\n\n**Timo Steffens: When you look at the benefit, it depends who you are. When you’re talking**\nto security teams, they have different benefits than politicians and government agencies.\n\nI think it’s also a general psychological phenomenon that people just want to know who did\nsomething. I worked quite a few years as an incident handler, and when I came to sites and\ntalked to victims, one of the first questions was always who was it and why did they do it—\nthe technical means and how they got into the network were often secondary. And it was\nuseful in that role to know who the actors might be and infer motivation and what they’re after\non the network… In the real world, you have a limited set of people and money, and you\nhave to prioritize. If you know what some countries are strategically after, and your company\nis doing a joint venture in some region, attribution certainly influences your decisions on how\nto prioritize your security measures.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe last thing is around diplomacy and governments. Attribution is a prerequisite and\nnecessary for anything diplomatic.\n\n**TR: Can you talk more about how attribution would influence decisions? If you found**\n**out an attack was carried out by a group like APT29, how would it be different from**\n**another group?**\n\n**TS: When you’re an incident handler and you talk to people and companies, the managers**\nget really nervous that their production networks and [operational technology] networks are\nsomehow in danger. If you can say that the [indicators of compromise] we have look like a\ncertain APT group, and that group does espionage and the country they belong to has really\nnever shown an interest in sabotage, you can really calm them down. Espionage is bad, they\ncan steal your intellectual property, but they probably won’t destroy your OT networks… at\nleast on purpose!\n\n**TR: How would you compare and contrast attribution done by the private sector and**\n**government agencies?**\n\n**TS: I think they complement each other in methods and, most of all, in sources. I often say**\nthere are three main challenges in attribution: the first is data, the second is data, and the\nthird is data. The sources are really the most important, and the difference is that law\nenforcement and government agencies can see some servers and request data from social\nmedia networks, stuff like that. On the other hand, the private sector has the treasure of\ntelemetry—signals and feedback from their security products, of course. So they compliment\neach other, but any formal cooperation between the two is difficult because everyone has\nlimitations on what data they can share. The private sector has its terms and conditions, and\nit can’t share customer data with everyone else. The government has its own rules. But even\nif there isn’t formal cooperation, the private and public sectors influence each other, and\nthey’re aware of what the other sector publishes.\n\nOnly when [art historians] realize that the artist didn’t paint all the paintings themselves\n—they had a workshop, where they may have made a sketch and had an assistant\npaint the background—then they were able to attribute it to a certain artist. That’s the\nsame problem we have with APT groups. They don’t necessarily have a fixed set of\npeople—some leave, some join, they might share malware or an idea for an exploit\nwith another group—so we have to… understand that the whole landscape is more\ndynamic, like a workshop.”\n\nAnother difference is that the private sector is really good at detecting new attacks and\nroughly clustering groups and malware. They often inform the agencies, which look further\ninto certain things.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysts and security companies do something called continuous attribution… their main job\nis not really attribution, but protecting customers, writing signatures, improving their security\nproducts. But every now and then they stumble across something that can be useful for\nattribution. The law enforcement approach is different—they really have the explicit goal to\ndo attribution. That’s what they’re paid for, that’s what they’re expected to do every day. They\ntypically look at specific incidents, where you have a specific case, a certain victim, and they\ncan’t stop if they have a specific country—indictments can only be issued against individuals.\nSo they have different goals and processes from the private sector.\n\n**TR: Do you think anything needs to change with how the public and private sector**\n**collaborate?**\n\n**TS: Well in the best of all worlds, I think there are many opportunities to collaborate. But the**\nmain limitations are sharing data. So in the end, it works OK, there aren’t hard boundaries\nbetween the public and private sectors… maybe you don’t always exchange data on\nattribution, but you share things related to malware, infrastructure, and stuff like that. In the\nlatest indictments, U.S. agencies have seemed to find a way to work together with some\nreally good analysts from companies, but I don’t know exactly what these arrangements look\nlike, and I think it will be case-by-case for future collaboration.\n\n**TR: When it comes to attribution and naming, you have FireEye giving groups a**\n**number, CrowdStrike does animals, Microsoft does elements… Do you think we will**\n**ever get to the point where we’ll have a unified system where we all know what each**\n**other is talking about?**\n\n**TS: In my view, the clustering and definition of APT groups is where the magic happens and**\nwhere the debate is going on. If you look at attribution, there’s always a debate about which\nincidents belong to one group or another. So it’s not just naming, it’s really the underlying\ndefinitions.\n\nI think my main point is that the whole concept of APT groups is just a simplification. It works\nas a model, just as the nuclear model works in physics, but everyone knows the reality is\nmore complicated. When we talk about groups, it’s not like a fixed set of people working\ntogether in an office for years and years. The reality is much more difficult. And for some of\nthese setups, even if you had complete knowledge, I don’t think it would be conceptually\nclear what the best or correct definition of groups would be. You have people that develop\nmalware and then provide it to operators, and for the next job might take a piece of that and\ngive it to someone else. The question then is, is this the same group? Groups also change\nover time—people age, they have families, they find different jobs or get promoted. It’s really\ndifficult to press this very complicated reality into APT groups, so we’ll have to live with this\nchallenge where every security company thinks their understanding of this group is the\ncorrect one and everyone else is wrong. This will certainly last for a long time, unless we\nfigure out a better model or theoretical concept for how to describe these APT landscapes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TR: How accurate do you think most attribution is?**\n\n**TS: I think in general the industry is doing quite fine nowadays. They do have a certain set of**\nmethods and most people have a general understanding of how strong an attribution is,\ngiven the evidence. If you look at the indictments that the U.S. agencies released, in my view\nI trust them and I’m not aware of any big surprises. Everything the indictments said, it aligned\nwith what the industry published beforehand.\n\nMost companies agree at least on the attribution to countries, but it’s different if you look at\nattributions to organizations or individuals. The indictments always contain something new\nbecause for the private sector it’s really hard to attribute to individuals or organizations, and\nmaybe it’s not even their motivation to do this. So I think the state-of-the-art is that we’re\ngood on country-level attribution, but it’s really hard on the organization or even individuallevel.\n\n**TR: Do you think APT groups are getting better at covering their tracks?**\n\n**TS: There have been several developments that complicate attribution. Groups outsource**\ntheir tools and techniques, so it can be really hard to figure out if an attack is APT10 or a new\ngroup. It’s certainly a problem. And the setup of groups is becoming more complicated, or\nmaybe we only now understand the difficulty of grasping all these capabilities into one\ngroup.\n\nOn the one hand, as the state of attribution progresses, we have so much knowledge about\ngroups and countries and what they’re after—their goals and how they run their APT groups.\nThis helps, since you don’t have to start from scratch every time you want to make an\nattribution. But on the other hand, sometimes this preexisting knowledge is a problem,\nbecause we’ve been doing these attributions for ten years or longer, and the group that\nattacked ten years ago is probably not composed of the same people, setup, contractors, or\nmaybe not even the same agency that runs it today. We need to find some rules or methods\nwhen it’s better to just discard APT definitions and not try to match incidents to groups that\nyou saw ten years ago.\n\n**TR: You’ve written a lot about false flags. What are the most common ones, and how**\n**do you identify them?**\n\n**TS: False flags are a really fascinating concept, and not just because actors apply them so**\nwell. The existence of the concept itself is the problem. Anything that you find could, in\ngeneral, be a false flag. When you look at the real false flags we’ve observed, most of them\nare quite similar. One thing that today most people wouldn’t even call a false flag is basically\ndomain registration data—it’s always fake. Nobody really sees it as a false flag, but in\ngeneral it is. Another common false flag is something written in a foreign language, but it’s\n\n\n-----\n\noften so badly done, because the people who plant these false flags don t speak the\nlanguage. You find grammatical errors and bad Google translations, so it’s really funny at\ntimes.\n\nSometimes this preexisting knowledge is a problem, because we’ve been doing these\nattributions for ten years or longer, and the group that attacked ten years ago is\nprobably not composed of the same people, setup, contractors, or maybe not even the\nsame agency that runs it today. We need to find some rules or methods when it’s better\nto just discard APT definitions and not try to match incidents to groups that you saw ten\nyears ago.”\n\nBut there can also be very complicated false flags. There was a famous and smart case of\nthe Olympic Destroyer malware, where an analyst at Kaspersky found they copied a rich\nheader to make it look like a known probably North Korean group. It was really complicated,\nbut if you use some methods it’s possible to infer that it may be a false flag. The malware\nisn’t the only aspect you need to look into—you need to look at the infrastructure, domain\nregistrations, telemetry, the stuff you might find on control servers. I’m not aware of threat\ngroups that really consistently plant their false flags in all of these aspects of their campaigns\n—they might focus on one or two, often the malware itself because the industry often\nfocuses on that.\n\n**TR: The state of attribution is something of an art right now. Can you talk about**\n**turning it into a science?**\n\n**TS: My goal is really to establish attribution as an accepted discipline, like criminology.**\nThere’s no guarantee that you can find a murderer or perpetrator, but there’s a certain set of\nmethods and processes and standards for how to present your results and establish\nconfidence in hypotheses. I think it would be really beneficial if we could reach this level for\nattribution. Of course, this is a bit tempered by the fact that we’re talking about espionage\nmostly, and so not all of the data can be transparent and public. It’s challenging to make\nattribution a discipline, but I really think we should aim to do it. One of the steps is to codify\nmethods and processes into a document, like a book. If you have these things documented,\nthey don’t have to start from scratch, they can start from there.\n\n**TR: You’ve mentioned how you see attribution as being similar to art history, too. Can**\n**you talk more about that?**\n\n**TS: I think it’s really odd that when you work in our field you always have to stay in threat**\nintelligence mode. I really enjoy going into art museums, and when I’m there I can’t help\nmyself from thinking like a threat intelligence analyst. At one exhibition, I realized that art\nhistory has the same problem as attribution. You have some artifacts and you need to find\nwho is behind them. They try to find the artist or painter, and we try to find the developer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are documented cases in art history where they try to figure out whether a certain\npainting was done by a certain artist or not, and they might say that a portion of a painting is\nnot done as well as the artist would normally have done. So they’re stuck. Only when they\nrealize that the artist didn’t paint all the paintings themselves—they had a workshop, where\nthey may have made a sketch and had an assistant paint the background—then they were\nable to attribute it to a certain artist. That’s the same problem we have with APT groups.\nThey don’t necessarily have a fixed set of people—some leave, some join, they might share\nmalware or an idea for an exploit with another group—so we have to abandon our idea that\neverything is a fixed set of APT groups and understand that the whole landscape is more\ndynamic, like a workshop. It’s a more difficult and complicated reality than just a single artist.\n\n**TR: What’s a group that has been easy to track, in your opinion, and how does it**\n**compare to a group that has given you headaches?**\n\n**TS: Everyone jokes about Gamaredon. Everyone can track them very easily, but**\nnevertheless they are very active and they accomplish their goals. So in the end, it’s not\nimportant whether you can be detected and attributed, but if you accomplish your job.\nThey’re very different from groups like APT29—they retool, get under the radar, and it can\nget hard to get back to tracking them. Once you do find them, you can unravel it and then\nyou’re fine again.\n\n**TR: How would you recommend a young analyst learn the tradecraft around**\n**attribution?**\n\n**TS: I’m a fan of books. I had an AI background, and when I had my job interview with my first**\nemployer, I didn’t know a lot of cybersecurity concepts. So I bought two books and went over\nthem. So I think the first is getting good recommendations for general overview books, and\nthen sticking with what you’re most interested in and practicing it. Try to get feedback on your\nanalysis. You’ll fail, you’ll get a lot of people telling you that you could do better, but the\nfeedback is so valuable and there are many good people out there and most of them are\nwilling to help and train and teach.\n\n**TR: How would you recommend sharing methods of tracking groups so as not to tip**\n**off adversaries now that in-person conferences aren’t an option?**\n\n**TS: I think this is quite established with the community, that we have some close groups and**\ntrusted corporations, and you should try to share your insights with these groups first who\ncan then help the public and the wider community. Don’t blast everything on Twitter. And also\ndon’t talk about attribution if you don’t have first-hand knowledge and data on it.\n\n**TR: How did you get into this type of work?**\n\n**TS: My background is in artificial intelligence and I also took a lot of psychology classes**\nbecause I was really interested in how the human mind works, how human problem solving\nworks and whether you can simulate this with computers Back when I was a student\n\n\n-----\n\nartificial intelligence was more about understanding the human brain and building something\nlike Data—the android in Star Trek. Today it looks a lot more like data crunching…\n\nMy PhD was on learning opponent behavior in robotic soccer. I developed some algorithms\nand approaches to predict the moves of your opponent. Then I was hired to work on early\nwarning systems—to predict the behavior of computer worms. Back then, 10-12 years ago,\ncomputer worms were a really big issue. Yes, we had WannaCry a few years ago, but before\nthat computer worms were really dead. I think that’s a lesson about how the threat landscape\nevolves in cycles, and I’m curious what we will talk about in five years.\n\n**TR: What motivated you to change your focus to attribution?**\n\n**TS: That’s a good question. I think it was really a byproduct of when I was an incident**\nhandler and having people constantly asking me who was behind an attack. It’s also in line\nwith my interests in the past. When I said I was interested in the human mind, I’m interested\nin how the opponent thinks and works, so I’m just trying to get as near to the people behind\nthe attacks as possible.\n\nAdam is the founding editor-in-chief of The Record by Recorded Future.
