We will continue to track the actor for any**\nfurther updates.\n\nAberebot malware author discussing the new version of malware on a cybercrime forum after Cyble reversed their malware and\npublished findings.\nDuring Cyble’s routine Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) research, we came across a malware posted by\n[a researcher on Twitter. The malware is a new banking trojan variant named Aberebot that steals sensitive information from](https://twitter.com/alberto__segura/status/1420008705672810500)\ninfected devices. This variant share similar behavioral patterns with other banking Trojans such as Cerberus. In addition to these\nsimilarities, the trojan also steals credentials using phishing, targeting customers of 140+ banks in 18 countries.\n\nAccording to an investigation conducted by the Cyble Research Labs, the Threat Actor (TA) behind Aberebot is using GitHub\nto store the phishing pages. This is because, adding the webpages to the APK will drastically increase the file size.\n\nWe suspect that the TAs are targeting users via a range of vectors such as phishing campaigns or third-party app\nstores. Additionally, in this case we found the malicious Trojan app masquerading as the legitimate Google Chrome app.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### APK Metadata Information: \n\nApp Name: Chrome\nPackage Name: com.example.autoclicker\nSHA256 Hash: 8bef7b86043f758a775a9cf4080f5b87d50df4778d03ecd94989f98cc5c91e75\n\n_Figure 1: APK Information of the Malware Sample Analyzed_\nThe malicious app requests 10 permissions in the manifest file. Out of these, 7 are dangerous and are listed in Table 1.\n\n**Permission Name** **Description**\n\n**android.permission.READ_CONTACTS** Access to phone contacts\n\n**android.permission.READ_SMS** Access SMS data\n\n**android.permission.RECEIVE_MMS** Receive and process MMSes\n\n\n-----\n\n**android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS** Receive and process SMSes\n\n**android.permission.SEND_SMS** Send SMSes\n\n**android.permission.WRITE_SMS** Modify/write the SMS data stored in the device\n\n**android.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE** Monitor device screen activities\n\n_Table 1 Permissions Requested by the Trojan_\nOnce the user enables the permissions listed in Table 1, the malware can steal information such as\ncontacts, OTPs, credentials etc., that are available in the infected device.\n\nDuring our static analysis, we identified the entry point classes of the Trojan. The two classes which can be used to start the\ntrojan are:\n\n1. com.example.autoclicker.MainActivity: This class is launched when the user clicks on the icon of the malicious\n\nChrome app.\n\n1. com.example.autoclicker.SmsReceiver – This class is initiated when the victim’s device receives an SMS/MMS.\n\nUpon analyzing from the entry points, we observed that the Trojan uses an obfuscation technique to\nrestrict Reverse Engineering (RE) and to avoid detection. It also uses special characters for class names to make the RE more\ncomplex. In addition, this app has multiple encrypted strings in various parts of the code, as shown in the Figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2: Code with Encrypted Strings_\nBy going through the malware’s obfuscated code, we found that it uses a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard\n(AES) and string operations for encryption.\n\nAES is a symmetric block encryption that uses a key to encrypt/decrypt the data. In this case, the app uses different keys for\ndecrypting suspicious encrypted strings. Some of these keys are shown in the code below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Code to Invoke Decryption Function with the Key_\nFigure 4 showcases the decryption code used by the Aberebot Trojan.\n\n_Figure 4: Code for the Decryption Function_\n\nUpon decrypting the strings, we found several suspicious strings such as URLs, commands, etc., as shown in Table 2.\n\nhxxps://api.telegram[.]org/bot1900116382:AAHdStvE0Pr4vI7ZEHj5BdFJAlCOvaovRRY/getUpdates\nhxxps://api.telegram.org/bot1900116382:AAHdStvE0Pr4vI7ZEHj5BdFJAlCOvaovRRY/sendMessage?\nchat_id=-561929911&text=\nhxxps://github.com/yutronsayshi/aberebot234/raw/main/\n\n\n-----\n\nContacts%0A %0A\n%0ABanking Apps%0A——————–%0A\nit_it.bnl.apps.banking.html\nCom.unocoin.unocoinwallet.html\n\n_Table 2 : Subset of suspicious strings after decryption_\n\nAs per our analysis, we found that the Trojan constantly communicates with a Command and Control (C&C) server hosted on\na Telegram bot account.\n\nWe also observed that the app steals information based on the commands from the Telegram bot. The Aberebot Trojan receives\ncommands from\nthe URL: hxxps://api.telegram[.]org/bot1900116382:AAHdStvE0Pr4vI7ZEHj5BdFJAlCOvaovRRY/getUpdates\n\nData is sent as a message to the Telegram bot using the\nURL: hxxps://api.telegram[.]org/bot1900116382:AAHdStvE0Pr4vI7ZEHj5BdFJAlCOvaovRRY/sendMessage?\n**chat_id=-561929911&text=**\n\nThe trojan then proceeds to perform malicious activities based on the C&C server commands. Some of the malicious\nactivities that Aberebot is capable of performing are listed below.\n\n### Malicious Capabilities:\n\n1. Collecting contact information from the device: The code used to collect contact data on\n\nthe victim’s device’s is shown in the figure below.\n\n_Figure 4: Code for the Decryption Function_\nThe contact data is uploaded with tag: – Contacts%0A————–%0A\n\n1. Intercepting OTP: The malware is capable of receiving SMSes and uploading the ones that contain numbers, as shown\n\nbelow.\n\n_Figure 6: Code to Collect OTPs from SMSes Received_\nOTP data upload tag: – New SMS Received!%0ABOT ID:\n\n1. Collecting the list of installed applications from the device\n\n1. Sending SMS messages to numbers as per the TA’s commands, as shown in the figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Code to Send SMS Messages Based on TAs Commands_\n\n1. Stealing credentials of social media accounts and banking portals from the victim device.\n\n1. Monitoring the victim device by leveraging the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE\n\n**BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICEis a permission that allows the AbereBot to monitor the device’s screen.**\n\n**Techniques used to steal credentials of social media and banking accounts:**\n\nThe banking Trojan uses phishing pages to steal credentials. The malware author has stored the phishing pages as HTML in a\nGitHub repository: hxxps://github.com/yutronsayshi/aberebot234/raw/main/\n\n_Figure 8: GitHub repo with Fake webpages_\nThe malware checks for the geolocation of the device and then downloads fake HTML pages based on it. Based on the command\nfrom C&C server, it shows the counterfeit HTML content on a WebView.\n\nWebView is view used by Android to display web pages inside applications\n\n\n-----\n\nThe below figure depicts the code used to show the HTML content using WebView.\n\n_Figure 9: Code to display fake page using web view_\nUpon analyzing the HTML pages, we observed that the credentials are uploaded to the C&C server in Telegram. The below figure\nshows the Gmail phishing page and the credential upload code.\n\n_Figure 10: Fake Gmail page and code to send credentials_\n\n### Abusing BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission:\n\nUpon enabling the BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission, the malware leverages this capability to enable\nall other permissions for itself. It constantly monitors the device screen using the same permission. Along with that, the app\nrestricts the user from modifying the app settings. The activities performed by abusing the\nBIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission are:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Restricting the user to enter or modify the app s settings page\n\n1. Constantly checking for targeted banking/social apps on the screen, and if any targeted app is present on the screen, the\n\nmalware shows the phishing page related to it for credential stealing.\n\n### Additional actions conducted by Aberebot: \n\n1. Tricking the user with legitimate-looking Google Chrome icon and name, as shown in figure 11.\n\n_Figure 11: The Aberebot Banking Trojan Masquerades as Google Chrome_\n2. Hiding the application icon from the device home screen after the app starts. The code used for hiding the icon is shown in\nfigure 12.\n\n_Figure 12: Code Used to Hide the Icon_\nCountries targeted by Aberebot: Austria, Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, France, Hong Kong, India,\n**Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Aberebot malware targets customers of 140 banks, including BCR Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, US\n**Bank, SBI, etc. In addition, apart from banks, other targeted**\naccounts include PayPal, MobiKwik, Unocoin wallet and Gmail, etc.\n\n### Targeted Banks in India:\n\nAccording to our findings, the malware uses phishing pages specifically designed for mobiles users. The State Bank of\n**India (SBI), HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, and Union Bank are some of the India-based**\n**banks targeted by Aberebot.**\n\nThe figure below shows the malware’s phishing page that has been designed to resemble the banking page of SBI, along\nwith the code for stealing credentials from unsuspecting users.\n\n_Figure 13: Phishing Page Designed to Target SBI customers_\nThe image below showcases the comparison between SBI’s legitimate banking portal and Aberebot’s malicious\nSBI phishing portal.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: Comparison of the Original SBI portal with the Fake SBI portal designed by Aberebot’s creator_\nAlong with banks, Aberebot Trojan is also targeting financial applications such as MobiKwik and **Oxigen Wallet, etc.**\nThe MobiKwik’s phishing page is shown in the figure given below.\n\n_Figure 15: Malicious MobiKwik’s Phishing Page Designed by Aberebot’s Author_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur research indicates that TAs are increasingly introducing new malware techniques to evade detection. Banking threats are\nincreasing with every passing day and are being enhanced with sophisticated techniques. Aberebot is one\nsuch example. According to our research, these types of malware are only distributed via sources other than Google Play\nStore. As a result, it’s imperative for consumers to practice cyber hygiene across their mobile\ndevices and online banking applications.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. If you find this malware in your device, uninstall it immediately.\n2. Use the shared IoCs to monitor and block the malware infection.\n3. Keep your anti-virus software updated to detect and remove malicious software.\n4. Keep your system and applications updated to the latest versions.\n5. Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.\n6. Download and install software only from registered app stores.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\nDefense Evasion [T1406](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406) Obfuscated Files or Information\n\n\nDiscovery [T1421](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1421)\n[T1430](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1421%22%20%EF%BF%BDHYPERLINK%20%22https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1430)\n\nCollection [T1507](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1507)\n[T1412](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1412/)\n[T1432](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1432/)\n\nCommand and Control [T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571)\n[T1573](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573)\n\n\nSystem Network Connections Discovery\nLocation Tracking\n\nNetwork Information Discovery\nCapture SMS Messages\nAccess Contact List\n\nNon-Standard Port\nEncrypted Channel\n\n\nImpact [T1447](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1447) Delete Device Data\n\nNetwork Effects [T1449](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1449) Exploit SS7 to Redirect Phone Calls/SMS\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): \n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n8bef7b86043f758a775a9cf4080f5b87d50df4778d03ecd94989f98cc5c91e75 SHA256 Hash of the\nAPK\nmalware\n\na1e56b54768a70b73f131ef3508bd47fff20ae7f80856a11a83894fe686d8cc1 SHA256 Hash of the\nsecond APK\nsample\n\nhxxps://api.telegram[.]org/bot1900116382:AAHdStvE0Pr4vI7ZEHj5BdFJAlCOvaovRRY/getUpdates URL Telegram\nBot URL\n\n\nhxxps://api.telegram[.]org/bot1900116382:AAHdStvE0Pr4vI7ZEHj5BdFJAlCOvaovRRY/sendMessage?\nchat_id=-561929911&text=\n\n\nURL Telegram\nBot URL\n\n\nhxxps://github.com/yutronsayshi/aberebot234/raw/main/ URL GitHub\nRepo\n\n## About Us\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves from cybercrimes and exposure in](https://cyble.com/)\nthe Darkweb.
