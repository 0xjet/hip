    "plain_text": "# Important Security Update\n\n**mimecast.com/blog/important-security-update/**\n\nAt Mimecast, we prioritize the security of our customers, and our commitment to being\ntransparent with them, above all else. These two principles have guided our rapid response\nto the [recent security incident, as well as this update and the customer and partner guidance](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/important-update-from-mimecast/)\nwe are providing today via directed actions in the Administration Console and the Mimecast\nCommunity.\n\nAs we previously shared, when Microsoft informed us about the compromise of a Mimecastissued certificate used to authenticate a subset of Mimecast’s products, we advised affected\ncustomers to break and re-establish their connections with newly issued keys. The vast\nmajority of these customers have taken this action, and Microsoft has now disabled use of\nthe former connection keys for all affected Mimecast customers.\n\nWe also launched an internal investigation, supported by leading third-party forensics\nexperts, and we are coordinating our activities with law enforcement. Our investigation has\nnow confirmed that this incident is related to the SolarWinds Orion software compromise and\nwas perpetrated by the same sophisticated threat actor.\n\nOur investigation also showed that the threat actor accessed, and potentially exfiltrated,\ncertain encrypted service account credentials created by customers hosted in the United\nStates and the United Kingdom. These credentials establish connections from Mimecast\ntenants to on-premise and cloud services, which include LDAP, Azure Active Directory,\nExchange Web Services, POP3 journaling, and SMTP-authenticated delivery routes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Although we are not aware that any of the encrypted credentials have been decrypted**\n**or misused, we are advising customers hosted in the United States and United**\n**Kingdom to take precautionary steps to reset their credentials.**\n\nWe have taken actions to isolate and remediate the identified threat, which we believe to be\neffective. We continue to examine and closely monitor our environment. We will continue to\ncommunicate updates directly to our customers if warranted, and, where appropriate, these\n[will be disclosed here on the Mimecast Blog. While we are committed to transparency and](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/)\nsharing insights with our customers, there may be limits to the details we can provide at this\ntime while elements of the investigation into this threat actor remain ongoing.\n\nRecent threat intelligence reports have described the campaign of attacks waged by this\nthreat actor. It is clear that this incident is part of a highly sophisticated large-scale attack and\nis focused on specific types of information and organizations.\n\nNow more than ever, transparency and cooperation within the security community are\nessential to an effective response. We expect that additional organizations will learn or share\nthat they were affected by the threat actor behind the SolarWinds Orion software\ncompromise. We have benefited from the expertise shared by others facing this threat, and\nwe are committed to doing the same, based on our own experience, to create a more secure\nand resilient community.\n\nProtecting our customers will always be our company’s top priority.\n\n## Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis communication contains “forward-looking” statements, which are subject to the safe\nharbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal\nsecurities laws, that are based on currently available information and our current beliefs,\nexpectations and understanding.
