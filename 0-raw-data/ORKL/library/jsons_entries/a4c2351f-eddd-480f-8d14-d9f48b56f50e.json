Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on\nthe dark underbelly of the internet.\n\n[See More →](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/cyber)\nOn Monday the FBI, DHS, and CISA—the U.S. government agency focused on defensive\n[cybersecurity—published a report laying out the tools, techniques, and capabilities of the](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-116a)\nSVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service that the U.S. has blamed for the wide-spanning\n\n\n-----\n\n[SolarWinds supply chain hack. That report said that the SVR makes use of a specific](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vz74/the-solarwinds-hacks-show-supply-chain-attacks-are-business-as-usual)\nanonymous email service called cock.li.\n\nThe administrator of cock.li has now told Motherboard that this is the first time he has heard\nof the SVR using his service, but that \"it's hard to surprise me nowadays.\"\n\n\"This is the first time I've heard for sure that Russian intelligence is using cock.li, but it's not\nsurprising, since the CIA uses it too,\" Vincent Canfield, the administrator of cock.li, said in a\nTwitter direct message. Canfield declined to provide evidence that American intelligence\nagencies use the service.\n\n**_Do you know anything else about how intelligence services are using_**\n**_anonymous email services? We’d love to hear from you. Using a non-work_**\n**_phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20_**\n**_8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on_** **_jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email_**\n**_joseph.cox@vice.com._**\n\nCock.li is an established, albeit obscure, meme email service. In 2015, Motherboard reported\nhow Canfield said that German authorities had seized a hard drive from one of his servers\nafter someone used the service to send a hoax bomb threat. Following the threat, all public\nschools in Los Angeles closed for a day. Two years later Canfield said SoundCloud removed\naudio of a phone call he had with the FBI concerning a bomb threat made against the Miami\nFBI office.\n\nThe site allows users to also create XMPP accounts, which can be used for encrypted\ninstant messaging, and lets them sign up while using the anonymity network Tor or other\nproxies. Many other email services block users who sign up using a VPN, for instance.\nCanfield claimed the service has over a million users, including with domains that aren't\nlisted on the site's front page. The tagline of the service is \"Yeah it’s email with cocks.\"\n\nUnder the heading \"General Tradecraft Observations,\" the joint FBI-DHS-CISA report says\nthat \"SVR cyber operators are capable adversaries.\"\n\n\"FBI investigations have revealed infrastructure used in the intrusions is frequently obtained\nusing false identities and cryptocurrencies,\" it continues. \"These false identities are usually\nsupported by low reputation infrastructure including temporary e-mail accounts and\ntemporary voice over internet protocol (VoIP) telephone numbers. While not exclusively used\nby SVR cyber actors, a number of SVR cyber personas use e-mail services hosted on\ncock[.]li or related domains.\" Some of cock.li's other domains include\n\"national.shitposting.agency\" and \"wants.dicksinmyan.us\".\n\n\"Anonymous e-mail is a necessary tool enjoyed by people across the world, including\ngovernments. It's a critical building block to a free Internet and if it's not provided by\nindependent companies like ours these state actors are likely to operate their own e-mail\n\n\n-----\n\nproviders, Crypto AG style, Canfield continued, referring to a historical case where the CIA\nsecretly ran an encryption company in Switzerland in order to intercept others'\ncommunications.\n\n\"We're proud to have worked with dozens of governments by educating them on the nature\nof anonymous e-mail, and while data is never handed over without legal obligation in our\njurisdiction, these reports have still helped to stop thousands of bad actors and these\ngovernments have thanked us as a result,\" Canfield said, adding that those who have\ninformation about users violating cock.li's terms of service can contact an abuse address.\nCock.li's terms of service says that users may be banned for \"Conducting any activity that\nbreaks the laws in which cock.li is governed,\" and \"Encouraging others to break cock.li's\nrules or the law using cock.li.\"\n\nAfter publication of the joint report, Kyle Ehmke, a researcher with cybersecurity firm\nThreatConnect, [tweeted that \"it's worth noting that 4400+ domains (current and historic) have](https://twitter.com/kyleehmke/status/1386695109392183298)\nbeen registered using a cock[.]li address. SVR registration among those almost certainly are\na small percentage.\"\n\n**_Subscribe to our cybersecurity podcast,_** **_[CYBER.](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2)_**\n\n## ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
