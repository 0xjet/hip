Sanger, Nicole Perlroth, Julian E. Barnes January 2, 2021\n\nContinue reading the main story\nOn Election Day, General Paul M. Nakasone, the nation’s top [cyberwarrior, reported that the](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/us/politics/pipeline-hack-darkside.html)\n[battle against Russian interference in the presidential campaign had posted major successes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/us/politics/russia-hack-usaid.html)\nand exposed the other side’s online weapons, tools and tradecraft.\n\n“We’ve broadened our operations and feel very good where we’re at right now,” he told\njournalists.\n\nEight weeks later, General Nakasone and other American officials responsible for\n[cybersecurity are now consumed by what they missed for at least nine months: a hacking,](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/us/politics/biden-putin-russia-hacking.html)\nnow believed to have affected upward of 250 federal agencies and businesses, that Russia\naimed not at the election system but at the rest of the United States government and many\nlarge American corporations.\n\nThree weeks after the intrusion came to light, American officials are still trying to understand\nwhether what the Russians pulled off was simply an espionage operation inside the systems\nof the American bureaucracy or something more sinister, inserting “backdoor” access into\ngovernment agencies, major corporations, the electric grid and laboratories developing and\ntransporting new generations of nuclear weapons.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt a minimum it has set off alarms about the vulnerability of government and private sector\nnetworks in the United States to attack and raised questions about how and why the nation’s\ncyberdefenses failed so spectacularly.\n\nThose questions have taken on particular urgency given that the breach was not detected by\nany of the government agencies that share responsibility for cyberdefense — the military’s\nCyber Command and the National Security Agency, both of which are run by General\nNakasone, and the Department of Homeland Security — but by a private cybersecurity\ncompany, FireEye.\n\n“This is looking much, much worse than I first feared,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat\nof Virginia and the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “The size of it\nkeeps expanding. It’s clear the United States government missed it.”\n\n“And if FireEye had not come forward,” he added, “I’m not sure we would be fully aware of it\nto this day.”\n\nInterviews with key players investigating what intelligence agencies believe to be an\noperation by Russia’s S.V.R. intelligence service revealed these points:\n\nThe breach is far broader than first believed. Initial estimates were that Russia sent its\nprobes only into a few dozen of the 18,000 government and private networks they\ngained access to when they inserted code into network management software made by\na Texas company named SolarWinds. But as businesses like Amazon and Microsoft\nthat provide cloud services dig deeper for evidence, it now appears Russia exploited\nmultiple layers of the supply chain to gain access to as many as 250 networks.\n\nThe [hackers managed their intrusion from servers inside the United States, exploiting](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/06/technology/cyber-hackers-usa.html)\nlegal prohibitions on the National Security Agency from engaging in domestic\nsurveillance and eluding cyberdefenses deployed by the Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\n\n“Early warning” sensors placed by Cyber Command and the National Security Agency\ndeep inside foreign networks to detect brewing attacks clearly failed. There is also no\n[indication yet that any human intelligence alerted the United States to the hacking.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/us/politics/russia-hack-usaid.html)\n\nThe government’s emphasis on election defense, while critical in 2020, may have\ndiverted resources and attention from long-brewing problems like protecting the “supply\nchain” of software. In the private sector, too, companies that were focused on election\nsecurity, like FireEye and Microsoft, are now revealing that they were breached as part\nof the larger supply chain attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nSolarWinds, the company that the hackers used as a conduit for their attacks, had a\nhistory of lackluster security for its products, making it an easy target, according to\ncurrent and former employees and government investigators. Its chief executive, Kevin\nB. Thompson, who is leaving his job after 11 years, has sidestepped the question of\nwhether his company should have detected the intrusion.\n\nSome of the compromised SolarWinds software was engineered in Eastern Europe,\nand American investigators are now examining whether the incursion originated there,\nwhere Russian intelligence operatives are deeply rooted.\n\nThe intentions behind the attack remain shrouded. But with a new administration taking office\nin three weeks, some analysts say the Russians may be trying to shake Washington’s\nconfidence in the security of its communications and demonstrate their cyberarsenal to gain\nleverage against President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. before nuclear arms talks.\n\n“We still don’t know what Russia’s strategic objectives were,” said Suzanne Spaulding, who\nwas the senior cyberofficial at the Homeland Security Department during the Obama\nadministration. “But we should be concerned that part of this may go beyond\nreconnaissance. Their goal may be to put themselves in a position to have leverage over the\nnew administration, like holding a gun to our head to deter us from acting to counter Putin.”\n\nImage\nThe Commerce Department, the Treasury Department, the State Department, the Energy\nDepartment and parts of the Pentagon were targets of the breach.Credit...Alyssa Schukar for\nThe New York Times\n\n## Growing Hit List\n\nThe U.S. government was clearly the main focus of the attack, with the Treasury\nDepartment, the State Department, the Commerce Department, the Energy Department and\nparts of the Pentagon among the agencies confirmed to have been infiltrated. (The Defense\nDepartment insists the attacks on its systems were unsuccessful, though it has offered no\nevidence.)\n\nBut the hacking also breached large numbers of corporations, many of which have yet to\nstep forward. SolarWinds is believed to be one of several supply chain vendors Russia used\nin the hacking. Microsoft, which had tallied 40 victims as of Dec. 17, initially said that it had\nnot been breached, only to discover this week that it had been — and that resellers of its\nsoftware had been, too. A previously unreported assessment by Amazon’s intelligence team\nfound the number of victims may have been five times greater, though officials warn some of\nthose may be double counted.\n\n\n-----\n\nPublicly, officials have said they do not believe the hackers from Russia s S.V.R. pierced\nclassified systems containing sensitive communications and plans. But privately, officials say\nthey still do not have a clear picture of what might have been stolen.\n\nThey said they worried about delicate but unclassified data the hackers might have taken\nfrom victims like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including Black Start, the\ndetailed technical blueprints for how the United States plans to restore power in the event of\na cataclysmic blackout.\n\nThe plans would give Russia a hit list of systems to target to keep power from being restored\nin an attack like the one it pulled off in Ukraine in 2015, shutting off power for six hours in the\ndead of winter. Moscow [long ago implanted malware in the American electric grid, and the](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/russia-cyberattacks.html)\nUnited States has done the same to Russia as a deterrent.\n\n## A Supply Chain Compromised\n\nOne main focus of the investigation so far has been SolarWinds, the company based in\nAustin whose software updates the hackers compromised.\n\nBut the cybersecurity arm of the Department of Homeland Security concluded the hackers\nworked through other channels, too. And last week, CrowdStrike, another security company,\n[revealed that it was also targeted, unsuccessfully, by the same hackers, but through a](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/us/russia-microsoft-resellers-cyberattacks.html)\ncompany that resells Microsoft software.\n\nBecause resellers are often entrusted to set up clients’ software, they — like SolarWinds —\nhave broad access to Microsoft customers’ networks. As a result, they can be an ideal Trojan\nhorse for Russia’s hackers. Intelligence officials have expressed anger that Microsoft did not\ndetect the attack earlier; the company, which said Thursday that the hackers viewed its\nsource code, has not disclosed which of its products were affected or for how long hackers\nwere inside its network.\n\n“They targeted the weakest points in the supply chain and through our most trusted\nrelationships,” said Glenn Chisholm, a founder of Obsidian Security.\n\nImage\nSolarWinds, the company most directly exploited by the hackers, had a history of lackluster\nsecurity for its own products, making it an easy target, according to its\nemployees.Credit...Sergio Flores/Reuters\nInterviews with current and former employees of SolarWinds suggest it was slow to make\nsecurity a priority, even as its software was adopted by America’s premier cybersecurity\ncompany and federal agencies.\n\nEmployees say that under Mr. Thompson, an accountant by training and a former chief\nfinancial officer, every part of the business was examined for cost savings and common\nsecurity practices were eschewed because of their expense His approach helped almost\n\n\n-----\n\ntriple SolarWinds annual profit margins to more than $453 million in 2019 from $152 million\nin 2010.\n\nBut some of those measures may have put the company and its customers at greater risk for\nattack. SolarWinds moved much of its engineering to satellite offices in the Czech Republic,\nPoland and Belarus, where engineers had broad access to the Orion network management\nsoftware that Russia’s agents compromised.\n\nThe company has said only that the manipulation of its software was the work of human\nhackers rather than of a computer program. It has not publicly addressed the possibility of an\ninsider being involved in the breach.\n\nNone of the SolarWinds customers contacted by The New York Times in recent weeks were\naware they were reliant on software that was maintained in Eastern Europe. Many said they\ndid not even know they were using SolarWinds software until recently.\n\nEven with its software installed throughout federal networks, employees said SolarWinds\ntacked on security only in 2017, under threat of penalty from a new European privacy law.\nOnly then, employees say, did SolarWinds hire its first chief information officer and install a\nvice president of “security architecture.”\n\nIan Thornton-Trump, a former cybersecurity adviser at SolarWinds, said he warned\nmanagement that year that unless it took a more proactive approach to its internal security, a\ncybersecurity episode would be “catastrophic.” After his basic recommendations were\nignored, Mr. Thornton-Trump left the company.\n\nSolarWinds declined to address questions about the adequacy of its security. In a statement,\nit said it was a “victim of a highly-sophisticated, complex and targeted cyberattack” and was\ncollaborating closely with law enforcement, intelligence agencies and security experts to\ninvestigate.\n\nBut security experts note that it took days after the Russian attack was discovered before\nSolarWinds’ websites stopped offering clients compromised code.\n\n## Offense Over Defense\n\nBillions of dollars in cybersecurity budgets have flowed in recent years to offensive\nespionage and pre-emptive action programs, what General Nakasone calls the need to\n“defend forward” by hacking into adversaries’ networks to get an early look at their\noperations and to counteract them inside their own networks, before they can attack, if\nrequired.\n\nBut that approach, while hailed as a long-overdue strategy to pre-empt attacks, missed the\nRussian breach.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage\nGeneral Paul M. Nakasone leads both the National Security Agency and the military’s Cyber\nCommand.Credit...T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\nBy staging their attacks from servers inside the United States, in some cases using\ncomputers in the same town or city as their victims, according to FireEye, the Russians took\nadvantage of limits on the National Security Agency’s authority. Congress has not given the\nagency or homeland security any authority to enter or defend private sector networks. It was\non these networks that S.V.R. operatives were less careful, leaving clues about their\nintrusions that FireEye was ultimately able to find.\n\nBy inserting themselves into the SolarWinds’ Orion update and using custom tools, they also\navoided tripping the alarms of the “Einstein” detection system that homeland security\ndeployed across government agencies to catch known malware, and the so-called C.D.M.\nprogram that was explicitly devised to alert agencies to suspicious activity.\n\nSome intelligence officials are questioning whether the government was so focused on\nelection interference that it created openings elsewhere.\n\nIntelligence agencies concluded months ago that Russia had determined it could not infiltrate\n[enough election systems to affect the outcome of elections, and instead shifted its attention](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/politics/mail-in-voting-russian-disinformation.html)\nto deflecting ransomware attacks that could disenfranchise voters, and influence operations\naimed at sowing discord, stoking doubt about the system’s integrity and changing voters’\nminds.\n\nImage\nThe focus on election defense, while critical in 2020, may have diverted both resources and\nattention from other long-brewing problems.Credit...Lauren Justice for The New York Times\nThe SolarWinds hacking, which began as early as October 2019, and the intrusion into\nMicrosoft’s resellers, gave Russia a chance to attack the most vulnerable, least defended\nnetworks across multiple federal agencies.\n\nGeneral Nakasone declined to be interviewed. But a spokesman for the National Security\nAgency, Charles K. Stadtlander, said: “We don't consider this as an ‘either/or’ trade-off. The\nactions, insights and new frameworks constructed during election security efforts have broad\npositive impacts for the cybersecurity posture of the nation and the U.S. government.”\n\nIn fact, the United States appears to have succeeded in persuading Russia that an attack\naimed at changing votes would prompt a costly retaliation. But as the scale of the intrusion\ncomes into focus, it is clear the American government failed to convince Russia there would\nbe a comparable consequence to executing a broad hacking on federal government and\ncorporate networks.\n\n## Getting the Hackers Out\n\n\n-----\n\nIntelligence officials say it could be months, years even, before they have a full\nunderstanding of the hacking.\n\n[Since the extraction of a top Kremlin informant in 2017, the C.I.A.’s knowledge of Russian](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/us/politics/cia-informant-russia.html)\noperations has been diminished. And the S.V.R. has remained one of the world’s most\ncapable intelligence services by avoiding electronic communications that could expose its\nsecrets to the National Security Agency, intelligence officials say.\n\nThe best assessments of the S.V.R. have come from the Dutch. In 2014, hackers working for\nthe Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service pierced the computers used by the\ngroup, watching them for at least a year, and at one point catching them on camera.\n\nIt was the Dutch who helped alert the White House and State Department to an S.V.R.\nhacking of their systems in 2014 and 2015, and last month, they caught and expelled from\nthe Netherlands two S.V.R. operatives [accused of infiltrating technology companies there.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55258790)\nWhile the group is not known to be destructive, it is notoriously difficult to evict from computer\nsystems it has infiltrated.\n\nImage\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia outside S.V.R. headquarters in Moscow in\nDecember.Credit...Alexey Nikolsky/Sputnik, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\nWhen the S.V.R. broke into the unclassified systems at the State Department and White\nHouse, Richard Ledgett, then the deputy director of the National Security Agency, said the\nagency engaged in the digital equivalent of “hand-to-hand combat.” At one point, the S.V.R.\ngained access to the NetWitness Investigator tool that investigators use to uproot Russian\nback doors, manipulating it in such a way that the hackers continued to evade detection.\n\nInvestigators said they would assume they had kicked out the S.V.R., only to discover the\ngroup had crawled in through another door.\n\nSome security experts said that ridding so many sprawling federal agencies of the S.V.R.\nmay be futile and that the only way forward may be to shut systems down and start anew.\nOthers said doing so in the middle of a pandemic would be prohibitively expensive and timeconsuming, and the new administration would have to work to identify and contain every\ncompromised system before it could calibrate a response.\n\n“The S.V.R. is deliberate, they are sophisticated, and they don’t have the same legal\nrestraints as we do here in the West,” said Adam Darrah, a former government intelligence\nanalyst who is now director of intelligence at Vigilante, a security firm.\n\nSanctions, indictments and other measures, he added, have failed to deter the S.V.R., which\nhas shown it can adapt quickly.\n\n“They are watching us very closely right now,” Mr. Darrah said. “And they will pivot\naccordingly.”\n\n\n-----",
