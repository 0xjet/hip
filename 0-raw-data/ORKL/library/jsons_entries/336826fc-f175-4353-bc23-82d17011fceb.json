We found a new variant of the ShadowPad backdoor, the group’s flagship\nbackdoor, deployed using a new launcher and embedding numerous modules. The Winnti\nmalware was also found at these universities a few weeks prior to ShadowPad.\n\nThe Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for for high-profile supply-chain\nattacks against the video game and software industries leading to the distribution of trojanized\n[software (such as CCleaner, ASUS LiveUpdate and multiple video games) that is then used to](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/cconsiderations-on-ccleaner-incident/)\ncompromise more victims. It is also known for having compromised various targets in the\nhealthcare and education sectors.\n\n[ESET researchers recently published a white paper updating our understanding of the arsenal](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/14/connecting-dots-exposing-arsenal-methods-winnti/)\nof the Winnti Group, following a blog post documenting a supply-chain attack targeting the\nvideogame industry in Asia. Additionally, we published a blog post on a new backdoor named\n\n\n-----\n\nskip-2.0 that targets Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nThis article focuses on the technical details of this new ShadowPad variant.\n\n_About the “Winnti Group” naming:_\n\n_We have chosen to keep the name “Winnti Group” since it’s the name first used to identify it, in 2013,_\n_by Kaspersky. Since Winnti is also a malware family, we always write “Winnti Group” when we refer_\n_to the malefactors behind the attacks. Since 2013, it has been demonstrated that Winnti is only one_\n_of the many malware families used by the Winnti Group._\n\n## ShadowPad found at several Hong Kong universities\n\n[In November 2019, ESET’s machine-learning engine, Augur, detected a malicious and unique](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/20/machine-learning-eset-road-augur/)\nsample present on multiple computers belonging to two Hong Kong universities where the\nWinnti malware had already been found at the end of October. The suspicious sample\ndetected by Augur is actually a new 32-bit ShadowPad launcher. Samples from both\nShadowPad and Winnti found at these universities contain campaign identifiers and C&C URLs\nwith the names of the universities, which indicates a targeted attack.\n\nIn addition to the two compromised universities, thanks to the C&C URL format used by the\nattackers we have reasons to think that at least three additional Hong Kong universities may\nhave been compromised using these same ShadowPad and Winnti variants.\n\nThis campaign of the Winnti Group against Hong Kong universities was taking place in the\ncontext of Hong Kong facing civic protests that started in June 2019 triggered by an extradition\nbill. Even though the bill was withdrawn in October 2019, protests continued, demanding full\ndemocracy and investigation of the Hong Kong police. These protests gathered hundreds of\nthousands of people in the streets with large support from students of Hong Kong universities,\nleading to multiple university campus occupations by the protesters.\n\nWe have contacted the compromised universities and provided the necessary information and\nassistance to remediate the compromise.\n\n### Updated launcher\n\nUnlike previous ShadowPad variants documented in our white paper on the arsenal of the\nWinnti Group, this launcher is not obfuscated using VMProtect. Furthermore, the encrypted\npayload is neither embedded in the overlay nor located in a COM1:NULL.dat alternate data\nstream. And the usual RC5 encryption with a key derived from the volume ID of the system\ndrive of the victim machine (as seen in the PortReuse backdoor, skip-2.0 and some ShadowPad\nvariants) is not present either. In this case, the launcher is much simpler.\n\n### DLL side-loading\n\n\n-----\n\nThe launcher is a 32-bit DLL named hpqhvsei.dll, which is the name of a legitimate DLL loaded\nby hpqhvind.exe. This executable is from HP and is usually installed with their printing and\nscanning software called “HP Digital Imaging”. In this case the legitimate hpqhvind.exe was\ndropped by the attackers, along with their malicious hpqhvsei.dll, in C:\\Windows\\Temp.\n\nAlthough we do not have the component that dropped and executed this launcher, the\npresence of these files leads us to think that the initial execution of this launcher is done\nthrough DLL side-loading.\n\nWhen the malicious DLL is loaded at hpqhvind.exe startup, its DLLMain function is called that\nwill check its parent process for the following sequence of bytes at offset 0x10BA:\n\n85 C0 ; test eax, eax\n0F 84 ; jz\n\nIn the case where the parent process is hpqhvind.exe, this sequence of bytes is present at this\nexact location and the malicious DLL will proceed to patch the parent process in memory. It\nreplaces the original instructions at 0x10BA with an unconditional jump (jmp – 0xE9) to the\naddress of the function from hpqhvsei.dll that decrypts and executes the encrypted payload\nembedded in the launcher.\n\nThe decompiled function responsible for patching the parent process is shown in Figure 1. In\ncase hpqhvsei.dll is loaded by a different process than hpqhvind.exe, the malicious code will\nnot be decrypted and executed.\n\n_Figure 1. Decompiled function responsible for patching the parent process_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe difference between the original and patched hpqhvind.exe is shown in Figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2. Difference between original (left) and patched (right) hpqhvind.exe_\n\nThe part of the code that is patched is located at the very beginning of the main function of\nhpqhvind.exe. As we can see in Figure 2, the patched code is located right after the load of\nhpqhvsei.dll. This means that the function responsible for decrypting and executing the\npayload is executed directly after the load of the malicious DLL.\n\n### Payload decryption\n\nThe encrypted payload is located in the .rdata section of hpqhvsei.dll and the decryption\nalgorithm is an XOR loop where the XOR key is updated at each iteration, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3. Pseudocode of the payload decryption loop_\n\nThe decrypted payload is the usual shellcode responsible for ShadowPad initialization\n(obfuscated using fake conditional jumps to hinder disassembly).\n\n### Persistence\n\nAfter having been decrypted, ShadowPad’s shellcode is executed. It will first achieve\npersistence on the system by writing the in-memory patched parent process to disk to a path\nspecified in the configuration string pool. In the case we examined, the path was\nC:\\ProgramData\\DRM\\CLR\\CLR.exe. It then creates a service named\nclr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32, which is responsible for executing CLR.exe. To avoid suspicion,\nthis service name, as well as the executable name, were chosen to look similar to the name of a\nMicrosoft .NET optimization Service.\n\nThe full staging process is summarized in Figure 4. The numbering on each arrow corresponds\nto the chronological sequence of events.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. ShadowPad staging process_\n\n### Modules\n\nShadowPad is a multimodular backdoor where the modules are referenced from the Root\nmodule with a circular list from which one can extract the module address, a UNIX timestamp\n(probably embedded automatically during the module’s compilation process) and a module\nidentifier. From the module itself we can also extract the name the developer gave to the\nmodule. This version embeds the 17 modules listed in the following table:\n\n_Table 1. Modules used with this ShadowPad version_\n\n#### ID Name Timestamp Description\n\n\n#### 100 Root Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:08:27 PM UTC\n\n 101 Plugins Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:07:02 PM UTC\n\n 102 Config Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:07:09 PM UTC\n\n 103 Install Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:07:46 PM UTC\n\n 104 Online Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:07:17 PM UTC\n\n\n#### Initial shellcode\n\n Provides API for the other modules; loads modules \n\n Handles encrypted configuration string pool\n\n Achieves persistence\n\n Overall communications with the C&C server\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ID Name Timestamp Description\n\n\n#### 106 ImpUser Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:07:24 PM UTC\n\n 200 TCP Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:01:01 PM UTC\n\n 202 HTTPS Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:01:15 PM UTC\n\n 207 Pipe Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:01:35 PM UTC\n\n 300 Disk Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:02:29 PM UTC\n\n 301 Process Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:02:36 PM UTC\n\n 302 Servcie Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:02:45 PM UTC\n\n 303 Register Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:02:52 PM UTC\n\n 304 Shell Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:03:00 PM UTC\n\n 306 Keylogger Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:03:16 PM UTC\n\n 307 Screen Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:03:25 PM UTC\n\n 317 RecentFiles Thu 24 Oct 2019 12:04:44 PM UTC\n\n\n#### User impersonation via token duplication\n\n TCP communications\n\n HTTPS communications\n\n Handles named pipes\n\n File system operations\n\n Process handling\n\n Service handling\n\n Registry operations\n\n Command line operations\n\n Keylogging to file system\n\n Screenshot capture\n\n Lists recently accessed files\n\n\n[These modules, except for RecentFiles, have already been mentioned by Kaspersky and Avast.](https://2018.conference.auscert.org.au/contents/data/2018/06/18161612/Noushin_Shabab_Finding_A_Monster_By_Its_Shadow_AusCERT18.pdf)\nNotice the “Servcie” typo.\n\nAs usual, all the module timestamps are spread over a short time range, which could suggest\nthe use of a build framework to compile these modules. This also suggests that these modules\nwere built a few hours before the launcher itself, whose compilation timestamp is Thu Oct 24\n\n\n-----\n\n14:10:32 2019. Since this compilation timestamp dates back two weeks before this campaign,\nit’s likely that it hasn’t been tampered with by the attackers.\n\nOne might also note that the number of modules embedded in this variant is much higher (17)\nthan the number of modules embedded in the variants previously documented in our white\npaper (8 to 10 modules).\n\nBy default, every keystroke is recorded using the Keylogger module ( 306, previously\ndocumented by Avast) and saved to disk in the file %APPDATA%\\PAGM\\OEY\\XWWEYG\\WAOUE.\n\nThe log file is encrypted using the same algorithm as the one used to encrypt static strings\nfrom the module. Using this module by default indicates that the attackers are interested in\nstealing information from the victims’ machines. In contrast, the variants we described in our\nwhite paper didn’t even have that module embedded.\n\n### Configuration\n\nAs with previous ShadowPad variants, the Config module (102) contains an encrypted string\npool that can be accessed from any other module. The string pool is never stored entirely\ndecrypted in memory; the field of interest is decrypted when needed and then immediately\nfreed (thus quickly unavailable). The configuration size is 2180 bytes and the encrypted strings\nare located at offset 0x84. The algorithm used to decrypt the strings is the same as the one\nused to decrypt the static strings of the module. The decrypted content of the string pool is the\nfollowing:\n\n0x84: 2019/11/7 16:28:36\n0x99: CAMPAIGN_ID_REDACTED\n0xa1: %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\DRM\\CLR\\CLR.exe\n0xc5: clr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32\noxe6: clr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32\n0x107: clr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32\n0x128: SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n0x158: CLR\n0x15e: %ProgramFiles%\\Windows Media Player\\wmplayer.exe\n0x197: %windir%\\system32\\svchost.exe\n0x1b7: TCP://b[redacted].dnslookup.services:443\n0x1db: UDP://b[redacted].dnslookup.services:443\n0x202: SOCKS4\n0x21e: SOCKS5\n\nThe campaign ID is located at offset 0x99 and is the name of the targeted university. Having a\ncampaign ID related to the target is quite common in the case of ShadowPad and Winnti.\n\nInterestingly, the timestamp present in this config at offset 0x84 is later than the modules’\ntimestamps and the loader compilation timestamp This suggests that this config is added\n\n\n-----\n\nmanually to the sample after having been built. Even though it s probably coincidental, the date\nwithin the config corresponds to the date of the first detection of this sample at the\ncorresponding university.\n\n### Network Communications\n\nOnce installed on the system, ShadowPad starts a hidden and suspended Microsoft Windows\nMedia Player wmplayer.exe process and injects itself into that process. The path to\nwmplayer.exe is provided by the Config module.\n\nOnce ShadowPad is injected into wmplayer.exe, the Online module will contact the C&C server\nusing the URL specified in the configuration. It will then start listening for connections on port\n13567 after having updated firewall rules accordingly:\n\nRegistry key:\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\FirewallRules\\\n{816381AB-1400-45E5-B560-B8E11C5988CF}\n\nValue:\nv2.10|Action=Allow|Active=TRUE|Dir=In|Protocol=6|Profile=Public|LPort=13567|Name=Network\nDiscovery (TCP)|\n\nThe communication is then handled by the TCP module (200), which was previously\n[documented by Kaspersky.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2017/08/07172148/ShadowPad_technical_description_PDF.pdf)\n\n## Winnti malware was there as well\n\nIn addition to ShadowPad, the Winnti malware was found on some machines at these two\nuniversities at the end of October (i.e. two weeks before ShadowPad) in the file\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\oci.dll and is detected by ESET products as Win64/Winnti.CA.\n\nThe Winnti malware usually contains a configuration specifying a campaign ID and a C&C URL.\nOn all machines the campaign ID matches the name of the targeted university and the C&C\nURLs are:\n\nw[redacted].livehost.live:443\nw[redacted].dnslookup.services:443\n\nwhere the redacted part corresponds to the name of the targeted university.\n\n## C&C URL format\n\nOne can observe that the C&C URL used by both Winnti and ShadowPad complies to the\nscheme [backdoor_type][target_name].domain.tld:443 where [backdoor_type] is a single letter\nwhich is either “w” in the case of the Winnti malware or “b” in the case of ShadowPad.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom this format, we were able to find several C&C URLs, including three additional Hong Kong\nuniversities’ names. The campaign identifiers found in the samples we’ve analyzed match the\nsubdomain part of the C&C server, showing that these samples were really targeted against\nthese universities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Winnti Group is still actively using one of its flagship backdoors, ShadowPad, this time\nagainst Hong Kong universities. In this campaign, the VMProtected launcher used with\nShadowPad, as well as with the PortReuse backdoor and skip-2.0, was replaced by a simpler\none. That these samples, in addition to having been found at these universities, contain\ncampaign IDs matching the universities’ names and use C&C URLs containing the universities’\nnames are good indications that this campaign is highly targeted.\n\nWe will continue to monitor new activities of the Winnti Group and will publish relevant\n[information on our blog.
