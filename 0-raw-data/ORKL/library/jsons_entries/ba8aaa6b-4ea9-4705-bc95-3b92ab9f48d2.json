A paper released today by our colleagues at Palo Alto\nNetworks presented a portion of data on this crew under the label “the Lotus Blossom\nOperation“, likely named for the debug string present in much of the “Elise” codebase since\nat least 2012: “d:\\lstudio\\projects\\lotus\\…”.\n\nThe group’s capabilities are more than the much discussed CVE-2012-0158 exploits over the\npast few years. Instead, the group is known to have employed half day spearphish exploits,\nstrategic web compromises, and watering holes employing fake Flash player update redirections. The group’s spearphish toolset includes PDF exploits, Adobe Flash Player\nexploits, and the common CVE-2012-0158 Word exploits including those generated from the\ninfamous “Tran Duy Linh” kit. While ongoing attacks by the Spring Dragon APT take us back\nto a focus on Vietnam, they appear to have rolled out a steady mix of exploits against\n\n\n-----\n\ndefense subcontractors around the world and government related organizations in VN, TW,\nPH, and other locations over the past few years. Let’s take a quick look at a couple more\nexamples of their intrusion capabilities that haven’t been mentioned elsewhere.\n\nOrganizations located in Myanmar and targeted by Spring Dragon have gone unmentioned.\nBut Spring Dragon’s infiltration techniques there were not simply 0158 spearphish, they also\ncompromised sites. In one case, they replaced specialized font installers needed to render\nMyanma font. You can see an image here of the “Planet Myanmar” website in late 2012\ndistributing such a package. All of the zip links were redirected to a poisoned installer zip file.\nThe download name was “Zawgyi_Keyboard_L.zip”, and it dropped a “setup.exe” that\ncontained several backdoor components, including an Elise “wincex.dll”\n(a42c966e26f3577534d03248551232f3, detected as Backdoor.Win32.Agent.delp). It\nbeacons out with the typical Elise GET request “GET\n/%x/page_%02d%02d%02d%02d.html”, as documented in the Lotus Blossom paper.\n\nAnother APT later abused this exact site to deliver malicious VBS (CVE-2014-6332) exploits\nin November of 2014 with a Lurid variant payload. And that same group also served a\nmalicious PDF exploit (CVE-2010-2883) from this site in June 2012 as “Zawgyi Unicode\nKeyboard.pdf”. Even earlier than that, they spearphished with that same PDF exploit object\nlater hosted on the website under different file names. In November 2011, they used\nfilenames appropriate for their spearphishing targets with this exploit like “台灣安保協會「亞\n太區域安全與台海和平」國際研討會邀 請 函_20110907.pdf” (“Taiwan Security Association\n\n\n-----\n\nInternational Seminar Invitation – the Asia-Pacific regional security and peace in the Taiwan\nStrait”), “china-central_asia.pdf”, “hydroelectric sector.pdf”, and various governmental related\nproposals. In this case, there was unexpected overlap from two APT.\n\nAnother interesting technique that we observed in use against government targets was a\ncampaign that lured recipients to a site redirecting users to a spoofed Flash installer site.\n\nThis site in turn redirected users to a Flash installer bundled with the common Elise\nbackdoor, eventually communicating with 210.175.53.24 and its usual “GET\n/14111121/page_321111234.html HTTP/1.0”.\n\nhxxp://www.bkav2010.net/support/flashplayer/downloads.html → redirected to\n\nhxxp://96.47.234.246/support/flashplayer/install_flashplayer.exe (TrojanDropper.Win32.Agent.ilbq)\n\nWhile this particular actor effectively used their almost worn out CVE-2012-0158 exploits in\nthe past, Spring Dragon employs more involved and creative intrusive activity as well.\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Social engineering](https://securelist.com/tag/social-engineering/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\n[Kurt Baumgartner](https://securelist.com/author/kurtb/)\n\nThe Spring Dragon APT\n\nYour email address will not be published.
