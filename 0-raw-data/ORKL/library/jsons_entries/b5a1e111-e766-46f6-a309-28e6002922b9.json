A primary objective of the\nattack, they claimed, was aimed at hindering Russian troop movements inside Belarus.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn public media reports, it has been stated that the rail service’s website issued a warning to passengers\n[that some e-ticket systems were unavailable (source: rw[.]by), seemingly confirming the Cyber-Partisans’](https://www.rw.by/corporate/press_center/news_of_passengers/2022/01/vnimaniyu-passazhirov_24012022/)\nclaims that they targeted network assets in order to disrupt operations. The Belarusian government has not\ncommented on the incident.\n\n[On Tuesday 24 January, Curated Intelligence member @SttyK obtained documents from Cyber-Partisans,](https://twitter.com/SttyK)\nwhich the group claimed would help SttyK “understand some of the methods used” during the attack. Initially\nSttyK reached out to the group seeking access to the malware used in the attack, which would have then\nbeen studied. However, the group declined to share the code, but noted they would “gladly do that once the\nauthoritarian regime in Belarus is gone.”\n\n## Known Information:\n\nBased on public reporting and previous interviews, the Belarusian Cyber-Partisans are \"a group of 15 self\ntaught hacktivists who claim to have assistance and support from disaffected Belarusian security forces\"\n[(source: CyberScoop). The group has been closely associated with a series of government website](https://www.cyberscoop.com/cyber-partisans-belarus-russia-ukraine/)\n[defacement operations. Last August, the group spoke to Patrick Howell O’Neill at Technology Review, in a](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/26/1033205/belarus-cyber-partisans-lukashenko-hack-opposition/)\nrather informative interview, should anyone want some additional background.\n\n## New Information:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned, SttyK reached out to the group in order to obtain malware samples for study. Instead, what\nthe group responded with were a series of documents. These documents represent a report based on an\ninvestigation into an attack on 14 March 2021, which concluded on 8 April of the same year.\n\nEditor Note: One of the first questions asked internally by Curated Intelligence members was “why?”. Why\nare they sharing such details, and what do they have to gain by exposing a previously released incident\nreport? There are a number of answers to that question, but the key answer is exposure. As is the case with\narticles in major publications, blogs such as this one give hacktivists attention to their cause. So then the\nquestion becomes, is the information they shared with us of importance to the public (yes, it is). Thus giving\nthem attention is worth the trade-off in our opinions, and serves our goal of informing the public.\n\n## The Stolen Incident Response Report:\n\nThe report was first mentioned in a YouTube video on the Cyber-Partisans’ own YouTube Channel in\n[November 2021 (see here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4etG0YKKQ)\n\n[The investigation and report began on 25 March 2021 and was done by VirusBlokAda (the antivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vba32_AntiVirus#VirusBlokAda)\nfirm that also first discovered Stuxnet)\n\nThe incident report costed 2530.00 BYN (worth an estimated $1,000 USD)\n\nIn the report, the initial date of compromise was discovered to be 14 March 2021\n\nAccording to the report, the victim was the Academy of Public Administration under the President of\nthe Republic of Belarus\n\nFig. 1 - Confirmation of who the victim was in the report\n\nFig. 2 - The incident report costed 2530.00 BYN (worth $1,000)\n\nFig. 3 - Initial date of compromise was 14 March 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 4 - Screenshot of files containing employee data being deleted\n\nFig. 5 - Screenshot of files in the backup server being deleted\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 6 - Screenshot of the report mentioning the use of Impacket\nImpacket - [https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)\n\nFig. 7 - Screenshot of the report mentioning the use of Chisel\nChisel - [https://github.com/jpillora/chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)\n\nFig. 8 - Screenshot of the report mentioning the use of 3proxy[.]ru\n\n3proxy - [https://3proxy.org/](https://3proxy.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 9 - Screenshot of the report mentioning 3389 (RDP) port forwarding over TCP\n\nFig. 10 - Screenshot of the report mentioning the use of Nmap, Mimikatz, CVE-2019-0708\n\nConsidering this was a full incident response investigation that cost less than $1,000 it is unsurprising that\nthe findings are unclear. The attack chain was not fully explained, but we have tried to piece it together as\nbest we can with the help of a Curated Intelligence member, [@0xDISREL, who can read and write Russian.](https://twitter.com/0xDISREL)\nWe still are not confident this is a full accurate representation of the group's TTPs, but should help\nnonetheless.\n\n## Summary of Attack:\n\nInitial access via BlueKeep RCE (CVE-2019-0708) in RDP in a Windows Server 2008 R2 system\n\nUsed the 3proxy[.]ru service to launch attacks from a VPS\n\nUse of Mimikatz to dump LSASS (SYSTEM level privileges are required however, how they obtained\nthese is currently unclear)\n\nNmap to identify systems (used Nmap to identify systems with Port 3389 open)\n\nUsed RDP to move laterally\n\nEventually landed on the victim's Domain Controller\n\nConfigured TCP port forwarding to open Port 3389 to the internet for persistent access\n\nDeleted data (such as employee records) from live and backup systems\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs):\n\n\n-----\n\nType Indicator Context\n\nSHA256 3c2fe308c0a563e06263bbacf793bbe9b2259d795fcc36b953793a7e499e7f71 RemoteAdmin.exe\n\nSHA256 bae88a899f41ddce157ed42a2a5f800cd00fcbc400a98a11a9563976ef4c9655 psexec.py\n\nDomain 3proxy[.]ru VPS Proxy\n\nThreat Hunting Tips:\n\n**Executed commands:**\n\nmstcpsvc32 %COMSPEC% /Q /c echo net user aaiadmin /domain ^> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\hibfile.sys\n2^>^&1 > %TEMP%\\execute.bat & %COMSPEC% /Q /c %TEMP%\\execute.bat & del\n%TEMP%\\execute.bat\n\n**Forwarded Ports:**\n\n3389 (RDP) -> Port 9000\n3389 (RDP) -> Port 9001\n4899 (RAdmin) -> Port 9002\n3389 (RDP) -> Port 9003\n\n**User Accounts:**\n\nThey used the default user aaiadmin\n\nCyber Kill Chain:\nCurated Intelligence member, [@TrevorGiffen, roughly mapped the intrusion analysis to Cyber Kill Chain,](https://twitter.com/TrevorGiffen)\nDiamond Model, and MITRE ATT&CK.\n\n\n-----",
