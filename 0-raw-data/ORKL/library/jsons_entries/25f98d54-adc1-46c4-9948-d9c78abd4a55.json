During incident\nresponse activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple\nAPT groups compromised the organization’s network,\nand some APT actors had long-term access to the\nenvironment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit\ncalled Impacket to gain their foothold within the\nenvironment and further compromise the network, and\nalso used a custom data exfiltration tool,\nCovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.\n\nActions to Help Protect Against APT\nCyber Activity.\n•\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nEnforce multifactor authentication\n(MFA) on all user accounts.\nImplement network segmentation\nto separate network segments\nbased on role and functionality.\nUpdate software, including\noperating systems, applications,\nand firmware, on network assets.\nAudit account usage.\n\nThis joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides APT actors tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) identified during the incident response activities by CISA\nand a third-party incident response organization. The CSA includes detection and mitigation actions\nto help organizations detect and prevent related APT activity. CISA, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA) recommend DIB sector and other critical\ninfrastructure organizations implement the mitigations in this CSA to ensure they are managing and\nreducing the impact of cyber threats to their networks.\n\nAll organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at\nreport@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to FBI via your local FBI field office or FBI’s 24/7 CyWatch at (855)\n292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov. When available, please include the following information regarding the incident:\ndate, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the\nactivity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact.

See the MITRE\nATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the APT cyber activity mapped to MITRE\nATT&CK for Enterprise framework.\nFrom November 2021 through January 2022, CISA conducted an incident response engagement on\na DIB Sector organization’s enterprise network. The victim organization also engaged a third-party\nincident response organization for assistance. During incident response activities, CISA and the\ntrusted –third-party identified APT activity on the victim’s network.\nSome APT actors gained initial access to the organization’s Microsoft Exchange Server as early as\nmid-January 2021. The initial access vector is unknown. Based on log analysis, the actors gathered\ninformation about the exchange environment and performed mailbox searches within a four-hour\nperiod after gaining access. In the same period, these actors used a compromised administrator\naccount (“Admin 1”) to access the EWS Application Programming Interface (API). In early February\n2021, the actors returned to the network and used Admin 1 to access EWS API again. In both\ninstances, the actors used a virtual private network (VPN).\nFour days later, the APT actors used Windows Command Shell over a three-day period to interact\nwith the victim’s network. The actors used Command Shell to learn about the organization’s\nenvironment and to collect sensitive data, including sensitive contract-related information from shared\ndrives, for eventual exfiltration. The actors manually collected files using the command-line tool,\nWinRAR. These files were split into approximately 3MB chunks located on the Microsoft Exchange\nserver within the CU2\\he\\debug directory. See Appendix: Windows Command Shell Activity for\nadditional information, including specific commands used.\nDuring the same period, APT actors implanted Impacket, a Python toolkit for programmatically\nconstructing and manipulating network protocols, on another system. The actors used Impacket to\nattempt to move laterally to another system.\nIn early March 2021, APT actors exploited CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858,\nand CVE-2021-27065 to install 17 China Chopper webshells on the Exchange Server. Later in March,\nAPT actors installed HyperBro on the Exchange Server and two other systems. For more information\non the HyperBro and webshell samples, see CISA MAR-10365227-2 and -3.\nIn April 2021, APT actors used Impacket for network exploitation activities. See the Use of Impacket\nsection for additional information. From late July through mid-October 2021, APT actors employed a\ncustom exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to exfiltrate the remaining sensitive files. See the Use of\nCustom Exfiltration Tool: CovalentStealer section for additional information.\nPage 2 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nAPT actors maintained access through mid-January 2022, likely by relying on legitimate credentials.\n\nUse of Impacket\nCISA discovered activity indicating the use of two Impacket tools: wmiexec.py and smbexec.py.\nThese tools use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Server Message Block (SMB)\nprotocol, respectively, for creating a semi-interactive shell with the target device. Through the\nCommand Shell, an Impacket user with credentials can run commands on the remote device using\nthe Windows management protocols required to support an enterprise network.\nThe APT cyber actors used existing, compromised credentials with Impacket to access a higher\nprivileged service account used by the organization's multifunctional devices. The threat actors first\nused the service account to remotely access the organization’s Microsoft Exchange server via\nOutlook Web Access (OWA) from multiple external IP addresses; shortly afterwards, the actors\nassigned the Application Impersonation role to the service account by running the following\nPowerShell command for managing Exchange:\npowershell add-pssnapin *exchange*;New-ManagementRoleAssignment name:\"Journaling-Logs\" -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User:<account>\nThis command gave the service account the ability to access other users’ mailboxes.\nThe APT cyber actors used virtual private network (VPN) and virtual private server (VPS) providers,\nM247 and SurfShark, as part of their techniques to remotely access the Microsoft Exchange server.\nUse of these hosting providers, which serves to conceal interaction with victim networks, are common\nfor these threat actors. According to CISA’s analysis of the victim’s Microsoft Exchange server\nInternet Information Services (IIS) logs, the actors used the account of a former employee to access\nthe EWS. EWS enables access to mailbox items such as email messages, meetings, and contacts.\nThe source IP address for these connections is mostly from the VPS hosting provider, M247.\n\nUse of Custom Exfiltration Tool: CovalentStealer\nThe threat actors employed a custom exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to exfiltrate sensitive files.\nCovalentStealer is designed to identify file shares on a system, categorize the files, and upload the\nfiles to a remote server. CovalentStealer includes two configurations that specifically target the\nvictim's documents using predetermined files paths and user credentials. CovalentStealer stores the\ncollected files on a Microsoft OneDrive cloud folder, includes a configuration file to specify the types\nof files to collect at specified times and uses a 256-bit AES key for encryption. See CISA MAR10365227-1 for additional technical details, including IOCs and detection signatures.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques\nMITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based\non real-world observations. CISA uses the ATT&CK Framework as a foundation for the development\nof specific threat models and methodologies. Table 1 lists the ATT&CK techniques employed by the\nAPT actors.\n\nPage 3 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\nTable 1: Identified APT Enterprise ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques\nInitial Access\nTechnique Title\nValid Accounts\n\nID\nT1078\n\nUse\nActors obtained and abused credentials of existing\naccounts as a means of gaining Initial Access,\nPersistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense\nEvasion.

Examine connection logs for\naccess from unexpected ranges, particularly from machines hosted by SurfShark and M247.\nMonitor for suspicious account use (e.g., inappropriate or unauthorized use of\nadministrator accounts, service accounts, or third-party accounts). To detect use of\ncompromised credentials in combination with a VPS, follow the steps below:\no Review logs for “impossible logins,” such as logins with changing username, user\nagent strings, and IP address combinations or logins where IP addresses do not align\nto the expected user’s geographic location.\no Search for “impossible travel,” which occurs when a user logs in from multiple IP\naddresses that are a significant geographic distance apart (i.e., a person could not\nrealistically travel between the geographic locations of the two IP addresses in the time\nbetween logins). Note: This detection opportunity can result in false positives if\nlegitimate users apply VPN solutions before connecting to networks.\no Search for one IP used across multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.\n Take note of any M247-associated IP addresses used along with VPN\nproviders (e.g., SurfShark). Look for successful remote logins (e.g., VPN,\nOWA) for IPs coming from M247- or using SurfShark-registered IP addresses.\no Identify suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or applying\nuser account mitigations.\no Search for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.\no Search for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated with\nnormal user activity, which may indicate bot activity.\n\nPage 9 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nReview the YARA rules provided in MAR-10365227-1 to assist in determining whether\nmalicious activity has been observed.\nMonitor for the installation of unauthorized software, including Remote Server\nAdministration Tools (e.g., psexec, RdClient, VNC, and ScreenConnect).\nMonitor for anomalous and known malicious command-line use. See Appendix: Windows\nCommand Shell Activity for commands used by the actors to interact with the victim’s\nenvironment.\nMonitor for unauthorized changes to user accounts (e.g., creation, permission changes,\nand enabling a previously disabled account).\n\nCONTAINMENT AND REMEDIATION\nOrganizations affected by active or recently active threat actors in their environment can take the\nfollowing initial steps to aid in eviction efforts and prevent re-entry:\n•\n\nReport the incident. Report the incident to U.S. Government authorities and follow your\norganization’s incident response plan.\no Report incidents to CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or 888282-0870).\no Report incidents to your local FBI field office at fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices or to\nFBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) via (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.\no For DIB incident reporting, contact the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) via DIBNET\nat dibnet.dod.mil/portal/intranet or (410) 981 0104.\n\n•\n\nReset all login accounts. Reset all accounts used for authentication since it is possible that\nthe threat actors have additional stolen credentials. Password resets should also include\naccounts outside of Microsoft Active Directory, such as network infrastructure devices and\nother non-domain joined devices (e.g., IoT devices).\nMonitor SIEM logs and build detections. Create signatures based on the threat actor TTPs\nand use these signatures to monitor security logs for any signs of threat actor re-entry.\nEnforce MFA on all user accounts. Enforce phishing-resistant MFA on all accounts without\nexception to the greatest extent possible.\nFollow Microsoft’s security guidance for Active Directory—Best Practices for Securing\nActive Directory.\nAudit accounts and permissions. Audit all accounts to ensure all unused accounts are\ndisabled or removed and active accounts do not have excessive privileges. Monitor SIEM logs\nfor any changes to accounts, such as permission changes or enabling a previously disabled\naccount, as this might indicate a threat actor using these accounts.\nHarden and monitor PowerShell by reviewing guidance in the joint Cybersecurity\nInformation Sheet—Keeping PowerShell: Security Measures to Use and Embrace.\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nPage 10 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nMITIGATIONS\nMitigation recommendations are usually longer-term efforts that take place before a compromise as\npart of risk management efforts, or after the threat actors have been evicted from the environment\nand the immediate response actions are complete. While some may be tailored to the TTPs used by\nthe threat actor, recovery recommendations are largely general best practices and industry standards\naimed at bolstering overall cybersecurity posture.\n\nSegment Networks Based on Function\n•\n\n•\n\nImplement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and\nfunctionality. Proper network segmentation significantly reduces the ability for ransomware\nand other threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—\nvarious subnetworks. (See CISA’s Infographic on Layering Network Security Through\nSegmentation and NSA’s Segment Networks and Deploy Application-Aware Defenses.)\nIsolate similar systems and implement micro-segmentation with granular access and\npolicy restrictions to modernize cybersecurity and adopt Zero Trust (ZT) principles for both\nnetwork perimeter and internal devices. Logical and physical segmentation are critical to\nlimiting and preventing lateral movement, privilege escalation, and exfiltration.\n\nManage Vulnerabilities and Configurations\n•\n\n•\n\nUpdate software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on network\nassets. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities and critical and high vulnerabilities\nthat allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment.\nImplement a configuration change control process that securely creates device\nconfiguration backups to detect unauthorized modifications. When a configuration change is\nneeded, document the change, and include the authorization, purpose, and mission\njustification. Periodically verify that modifications have not been applied by comparing current\ndevice configurations with the most recent backups. If suspicious changes are observed,\nverify the change was authorized.\n\nSearch for Anomalous Behavior\n•\n\n•\n\nUse cybersecurity visibility and analytics tools to improve detection of anomalous\nbehavior and enable dynamic changes to policy and other response actions. Visibility tools\ninclude network monitoring tools and host-based logs and monitoring tools, such as an\nendpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools are particularly useful for detecting\nlateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for\neach host.\nMonitor the use of scripting languages (e.g., Python, Powershell) by authorized and\nunauthorized users. Anomalous use by either group may be indicative of malicious activity,\nintentional or otherwise.\n\nPage 11 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nRestrict and Secure Use of Remote Admin Tools\n•\n\n•\n\nLimit the number of remote access tools as well as who and what can be accessed\nusing them. Reducing the number of remote admin tools and their allowed access will\nincrease visibility of unauthorized use of these tools.\nUse encrypted services to protect network communications and disable all clear text\nadministration services (e.g., Telnet, HTTP, FTP, SNMP 1/2c). This ensures that sensitive\ninformation cannot be easily obtained by a threat actor capturing network traffic.\n\nImplement a Mandatory Access Control Model\n•\n\nImplement stringent access controls to sensitive data and resources. Access should be\nrestricted to those users who require access and to the minimal level of access needed.\n\nAudit Account Usage\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nMonitor VPN logins to look for suspicious access (e.g., logins from unusual geo locations,\nremote logins from accounts not normally used for remote access, concurrent logins for the\nsame account from different locations, unusual times of the day).\nClosely monitor the use of administrative accounts. Admin accounts should be used\nsparingly and only when necessary, such as installing new software or patches. Any use of\nadmin accounts should be reviewed to determine if the activity is legitimate.\nEnsure standard user accounts do not have elevated privileges. Any attempt to increase\npermissions on standard user accounts should be investigated as a potential compromise.\n\nVALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS\nIn addition to applying mitigations, CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend exercising, testing, and validating\nyour organization's security program against threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for\nEnterprise framework in this advisory. CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend testing your existing security\ncontrols inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this\nadvisory.\nTo get started:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nSelect an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 1).\nAlign your security technologies against the technique.\nTest your technologies against the technique.\nAnalyze the performance of your detection and prevention technologies.\nRepeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance\ndata.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the\ndata generated by this process.\nCISA, FBI, and NSA recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production\nenvironment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this\nadvisory.\n\nPage 12 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nRESOURCES\nCISA offers several no-cost scanning and testing services to help organizations reduce their exposure\nto threats by taking a proactive approach to mitigating attack vectors.

When interacting with the victim’s system and executing\ncommands, the threat actors used /q and /c parameters to turn the echo off, carry out the command\nspecified by a string, and stop its execution once completed.\nOn the first day, the threat actors consecutively executed many commands within the Windows\nCommand Shell to learn about the organization’s environment and to collect sensitive data for\neventual exfiltration (see Table 2).\nTable 2: Windows Command Shell Activity (Day 1)\nCommand\n\nDescription / Use\n\nnet share\n\nUsed to create, configure, and delete network shares from the\ncommand-line.[1] The threat actor likely used this command to\ndisplay information about shared resources on the local computer\nand decide which directories to exploit.\n\npowershell dir\n\nAn alias (shorthand) for the PowerShell Get-ChildItem cmdlet.\nThis command maps shared drives by specifying a path to one\nlocation and retrieving the items from another.[2] The threat actor\nadded additional switches (aka options, parameters, or flags) to\nform a “one liner,” an expression to describe commonly used\ncommands used in exploitation: powershell dir -recurse path e:\\<redacted>|select fullname,length|export-csv\nc:\\windows\\temp\\temp.txt. This particular command lists\nsubdirectories of the target environment when.\n\nsysteminfo\n\nDisplays detailed configuration information [3], tasklist – lists\ncurrently running processes [4], and ipconfig – displays all current\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP network configuration\nvalues and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\nand Domain Name System (DNS) settings, respectively [5]. The\nthreat actor used these commands with specific switches to\ndetermine if the system was a VMware virtual machine:\nsysteminfo > vmware & date /T, tasklist /v > vmware &\ndate /T, and ipconfig /all >> vmware & date /.\n\nroute print\n\nUsed to display and modify the entries in the local IP routing table.\n[6] The threat actor used this command to display the entries in the\nlocal IP routing table.\n\nPage 14 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\nnetstat\n\nUsed to display active TCP connections, ports on which the\ncomputer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPv4\nstatistics, and IPv6 statistics.[7] The threat actor used this\ncommand with three switches to display TCP connections, prevent\nhostname determination of foreign IP addresses, and specify the\nprotocol for TCP: netstat -anp tcp.\n\ncertutil\n\nUsed to dump and display certification authority (CA) configuration\ninformation, configure Certificate Services, backup and restore CA\ncomponents, and verify certificates, key pairs, and certificate\nchains.[8] The threat actor used this command with three switches\nto test if they could download files from the internet: certutil urlcache -split -f https://microsoft.com temp.html.\n\nping\n\nSends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echoes to verify\nconnectivity to another TCP/IP computer.[9] The threat actor used\nping -n 2 apple.com to either test their internet connection or to\ndetect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments or\nnetwork restrictions.\n\ntaskkill\n\nUsed to end tasks or processes.[10] The threat actor used\ntaskkill /F /PID 8952 to probably disable security features.\nCISA was unable to determine what this process was as the\nprocess identifier (PID) numbers are dynamic.\n\nPowerShell CompressArchive cmdlet\n\nUsed to create a compressed archive or to zip files from specified\nfiles and directories.[11] The threat actor used parameters\nindicating shared drives as file and folder sources and the\ndestination archive as zipped files. Specifically, they collected\nsensitive contract-related information from the shared drives.\n\nOn the second day, the APT cyber actors executed the commands in Table 3 to perform discovery as\nwell as collect and archive data.\nTable 3: Windows Command Shell Activity (Day 2)\nCommand\nntfsinfo.exe\n\nDescription / Use\nUsed to obtain volume information from the New Technology File\nSystem (NTFS) and to print it along with a directory dump of NTFS\nmeta-data files.[12]\n\nPage 15 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\nUsed to compress files and subsequently masqueraded\nWinRAR.exe by renaming it VMware.exe.[13]\n\nWinRAR.exe\n\nOn the third day, the APT cyber actors returned to the organization’s network and executed the\ncommands in Table 4.\nTable 4: Windows Command Shell Activity (Day 3)\nCommand\n\nDescription / Use\n\npowershell -ep bypass\nimport-module\n.\\vmware.ps1;exportmft -volume e\n\nThreat actors ran a PowerShell command with parameters to\nchange the execution mode and bypass the Execution Policy to run\nthe script from PowerShell and add a module to the current section:\npowershell -ep bypass import-module\n.\\vmware.ps1;export-mft -volume e. This module appears to\nacquire and export the Master File Table (MFT) for volume E for\nfurther analysis by the cyber actor.[14]\n\nset.exe\n\nUsed to display the current environment variable settings.[15] (An\nenvironment variable is a dynamic value pointing to system or user\nenvironments (folders) of the system. System environment\nvariables are defined by the system and used globally by all users,\nwhile user environment variables are only used by the user who\ndeclared that variable and they override the system environment\nvariables (even if the variables are named the same).\n\ndir.exe\n\nUsed to display a list of a directory's files and subdirectories\nmatching the eagx* text string, likely to confirm the existence of\nsuch file.\n\ntasklist.exe and\nfind.exe\n\nUsed to display a list of applications and services with their PIDs for\nall tasks running on the computer matching the string\n“powers”.[16][17][18]\n\nping.exe\n\nUsed to send two ICMP echos to amazon.com. This could have\nbeen to detect or avoid virtualization and analysis environments,\ncircumvent network restrictions, or test their internet connection.[19]\n\ndel.exe with the /f\nparameter\n\nUsed to force the deletion of read-only files with the *.rar and\ntempg* wildcards.[20]\n\nPage 16 of 16 | Product ID: AA22-277A\n\nTLP:WHITE",
