The PlugX malware stood out to us as this variant infects any attached removable\nUSB media devices such as floppy, thumb or flash drives and any additional systems the\nUSB is later plugged into.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis PlugX malware also hides actor files in a USB device using a novel technique that\nworks even on the most recent Windows operating systems (OS) at the time of writing this\npost. This means the malicious files can only be viewed on a Unix-like (*nix) OS or by\nmounting the USB device in a forensic tool.\n\nWe also discovered a similar variant of PlugX in VirusTotal that infects USB devices and\ncopies all Adobe PDF and Microsoft Word files from the host. It places these copies in a\nhidden folder on the USB device that is created by the malware.\n\nPlugX is a second-stage implant used not only by multiple groups with a Chinese nexus but\nalso by several cybercrime groups. It has been around for over a decade and has been\nobserved in some high-profile cyberattacks, including the U.S. Government Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) breach in 2015. It is a modular malware framework,\nsupporting an evolving set of capabilities throughout the years.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the types of threats discussed in\n[this blog by products including Cortex XDR and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) [WildFire.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/wildfire)\n\n**Related Unit 42 Topics** [PlugX,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/thor-plugx-variant/) [Brute Ratel C4](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/brute-ratel-c4-tool/)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nPlugX Malware Infection\n\nPlugX Malware USB Overview\n\nPlugX Malware USB Infection\n\nPlugX Malware Post USB Infection\n\nPlugX Malware USB Variant Two\n\nAssociation With PlugX Malware\n\nConclusion\n\nUnit 42 Managed Threat Hunting Queries\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt's not uncommon for multiple malware samples to be discovered during an investigation, as\noccurred in this situation with GootLoader, Brute Ratel C4 and PlugX. Numerous threat\nactors compromise targets and can coexist simultaneously on the affected machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause we can t conclusively say whether these malware samples were left by one group\nor several, we can't attribute these tools to the Black Basta ransomware group. However, the\n[version of Brute Ratel C4 used in this case is the same one reported by Trend Micro, which](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ca/research/22/j/black-basta-infiltrates-networks-via-qakbot-brute-ratel-and-coba.html)\nalso involved the Black Basta ransomware group.\n\n## PlugX Malware Infection\n\nHistorically, a PlugX infection begins by hijacking a known and trusted, digitally signed\nsoftware application to load an actor-created encrypted payload. This technique has been\nused since 2010 and is listed in the MITRE ATT&CK techniques as Hijack execution flow\nDLL-Side loading ID: T1574.002 Sub-technique T1574.\n\nIn this case, the threat actors decided to hijack a popular and free open source debugging\n[tool for Windows called x64dbg, which is used by the malware analysis/reverse engineering](https://x64dbg.com/)\ncommunity. X64dbg applications are digitally signed by \"Open Source Developer Duncan\nOgilvie.\"\n\nThe developers of this tool offer two types of debugger applications: x64 for 64-bit\napplications and x32 for 32-bit applications. In this case, the actors used x32dbg.exe, which\nis the 32-bit debugger of x64dbg.\n\nUpon execution of x32dbg.exe, Microsoft Windows will attempt to resolve any dependency\nfiles necessary to run the application. That search starts locally (i.e., in the current working\ndirectory). If found, the necessary files are loaded and executed.\n\nX32bridge.dll is a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL) dependency file of x32dbg.exe. A\nlegitimate x32bridge.dll also carries the same digital signature. In this case, the file is not\nsigned.\n\nOnce loaded, the malware searches locally for an actor-created encrypted payload file:\nx32bridge.dat (SHA256:\ne72e49dc1d95efabc2c12c46df373173f2e20dab715caf58b1be9ca41ec0e172).\n\nX32bridge.dat was first submitted to VirusTotal on Jan. 22, 2021. As of Dec. 15, 2022, it has\na detection score of eight out of 61 engines. None of the engines identify the file as PlugX\nmalware.\n\nOnce loaded and decrypted in memory, the malware infects the host and any removable\nUSB devices attached with the PlugX malware. Figure 1 below illustrates PlugX DLL side\nloading using x64dbg DLL hijacking.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. PlugX DLL sideloading using x64dbg.\nBoth the hijacking of x64dbg and the association of this behavior with the PlugX malware\n[were reported by Sophos back in November 2020. Their blog refers to this malware as](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/11/04/a-new-apt-uses-dll-side-loads-to-killlsomeone/)\n_KilllSomeOne, based on a Program Database (PDB) string found in one of the binaries._\n\nSophos performed an excellent analysis of the samples and touched on the USB infection.\nWe confirmed that our sample matched the behaviors described in their report. From there,\nwe wanted to expand our research by focusing on the USB infection, other USB variants in\nthe wild and links to the PlugX malware.\n\n## PlugX Malware USB Overview\n\nThe technique used by the PlugX malware to hide files in a USB device involves using a\ncertain Unicode character. This hinders Windows Explorer and the command shell (cmd.exe)\nfrom displaying the USB directory structure and any files, concealing them from the victim.\n\nThe Unicode character used by this PlugX malware for the directories is 00A0 (a whitespace\ncharacter called a no-break space). The whitespace character prevents the Windows\nOperating System from rendering the directory name, concealing it rather than leaving a\nnameless folder in Explorer.\n\nTo achieve code execution of the malware from the hidden directory, a Windows shortcut\n(.lnk) file is created on the root folder of the USB device. The shortcut path to the malware\ncontains the Unicode whitespace character, which is a space that does not cause a line\nbreak, but this is not visible when viewed via Windows Explorer, as shown below in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Windows shortcut properties for accessing the hidden directory.\nWhen the shortcut file is viewed in a hex editor, the hex representation of these characters is\nshown as highlighted below in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Windows shortcut properties shown in a hex editor display.\nThe PlugX malware uses the Component Object Model (COM) interface to create the .lnk\nfiles and includes the Unicode character 00A0. It does this by creating an instance of a shell\ndesktop to create the associated Windows shortcut files. The ShellLink SetArguments\nmethod is used to set the command line arguments, which include the white space no break\nUnicode character, as shown in Figure 4 below.\n\nFigure 4. COM ShellLink::SetArguments.\nFinally, the ShellLink::Save method saves the shortcut file with all the changes.\n\n\n-----\n\n## PlugX Malware USB Infection\n\nThe PlugX malware x32bridge.dll loads x32bridge.dat, which is responsible for implanting the\nhost with malware and infecting any attached removable media USB devices such as floppy,\nthumb or flash drives. If a removable media device is found, the following steps are\nperformed:\n\n1. It creates the following directory structure:\n\n_<usb volume>:\\u00A0\\u00A0\\RECYCLER.BIN\\files. Example: F:\\ \\_\n_\\RECYCLER.BIN\\files._\n2. It creates a hidden file named desktop.ini in each folder, which specifies the icon for the\n\nfolder. This file contains the following data:\n\n[.ShellClassInfo]\n\nIconResource=%systemroot%\\system32\\SHELL32.dll,7\n\nThe Windows OS uses a single file to retrieve icon images that are displayed on the desktop\nas shortcuts or from Windows Explorer files and folders. The Shell32.dll file contains a list of\nicons and a unique number. In this case, the drive icon and the number 7 are used, as\nshown below in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5. Drive icon number 7.\n\nThe use of this drive icon makes the directories appear as drives within Windows Explorer\nwhen viewed with hidden files enabled. If deleted, the directories appear as folders.\n\n1. In the second directory, it creates a subfolder named RECYLER.BIN. This directory\n\nacts as a recycle bin. In that directory is a subdirectory named files and a hidden\ndesktop.ini file. This desktop.ini file contains the following data:\n\n[.ShellClassInfo]\n\nCLSID = {645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\n\nThis CLSID instructs Windows Explorer to display the created RECYCLER.BIN folder as a\nrecycle bin directory by giving it the recycle bin icon. This is shown in Figure 11 as an\nexample.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The files subfolder contains copies of the PlugX malware x32dbg.exe, any encrypted\n\nactor .dat files and the actor’s malicious DLL. An example of this is shown in Figure 6\nbelow.\n\nFigure 6. Infected UBS removable device displayed via WinHex.\nIt should be noted that pre-infection of the USB device, existing files or directories on the root\nof the removable device are moved to the second hidden folder on the USB device, as\nshown below in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7. Side-by-side comparison of the root directories of a non-infected versus infected\nUSB device.\n\n1. Whenever the shortcut file from the infected USB device is clicked, the PlugX malware\n\nlaunches Windows Explorer and passes the directory path as a parameter. This then\ndisplays the files on the USB device from within the hidden directories and also infects\nthe host with the PlugX malware. The victim sees their files and assumes all is working\nas expected.\n\nFigure 8 below illustrates how an infected USB thumb drive would appear to a victim in\nWindows Explorer using default settings (i.e., not displaying hidden files).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Windows Explorer showing infected USB Removable Device. (Show hidden files\nnot enabled.)\nAn infected PlugX USB device has no files or directories in the root folder and contains only\na .lnk file.\n\nFigure 9 shows that the shortcut file is TESTDRIVE, which matches the USB device name.\nThe shortcut file is responsible for infecting the host and navigating to the hidden directory on\nthe USB device each time it is clicked. For example, the shortcut file referenced in Figure 9\ncontains the following data:\n\n%comspec% /q /c \" \\ \\RECYCLER.BIN\\files\\x32dbg.exe\"\n\nOnce the target clicks the shortcut, x32dbg.exe is launched via cmd.exe from the hidden files\ndirectory on the USB device. The host the USB is attached to is now infected with the PlugX\nmalware.\n\nWhen viewing the contents of the infected USB device with Windows Explorer and hidden\nitems enabled, a victim would see the following images:\n\nFigure 9. Windows Explorer showing infected USB Removable Device (root folder).\nThey would then see the following, as shown in Figure 10, within the first hidden directory:\n\nFigure 10. Windows Explorer showing an infected USB removable device (hidden directory\n\n\n-----\n\nnumber one).\nAs shown in Figure 11, Windows Explorer displays another hidden directory along with a\nshortcut file. The shortcut file has the same properties to launch x32dbg.exe and will infect\nthe host with the USB device attached.\n\nWhen viewing the contents of the next hidden folder, Windows Explorer shows the following\ndirectory structure:\n\nFigure 11. Windows Explorer showing infected USB Removable Device (hidden directory\nnumber two).\nThis directory contains a RECYLER.BIN folder that masquerades as a Windows recycle bin,\nalong with any files or directories that existed in the root folder of the USB device at the time\nof infection. When viewing the contents of the RECYLER.BIN with Windows Explorer, a\nvictim will see what’s shown in Figure 12:\n\nFigure 12. Windows Explorer showing infected USB Removable Device (RECYLER.BIN\nfolder).\nSince the default setting for Windows Explorer is not to show hidden items, the only item\nvisible to the victim is the shortcut file, as shown in Figure 8. Even with hidden files enabled,\nWindows Explorer or cmd.exe cannot show the malware files that reside in the files\nsubdirectory.\n\nThe malware files can only be viewed on a *nix OS or by mounting the USB device in a\nforensic tool. Figure 13 shows how the USB device looks once it’s mounted in Ubuntu,\nbrowsing to it via File Explorer.\n\nFigure 13.\n\nUbuntu File Explorer viewing an infected USB device.\n\n\n-----\n\n## PlugX Malware Post USB Infection\n\nWhen a host is infected with this variant of the PlugX malware, the malware continuously\nmonitors for USB removable devices. Once a USB device is discovered and infected, any\nnew files written to the USB device root folder post-infection are moved to the hidden folder\nwithin the USB device. Since the Windows shortcut file resembles that of a USB device and\nthe malware displays the victim's files, they unwittingly continue to spread the PlugX\nmalware.\n\n## PlugX Malware USB Variant Two\n\nArmed with this knowledge, we wondered if other similar PlugX USB infection malware\nexisted in the wild. File SHA256:\n5b496972a86cea66aeecaac6e3f67a92e22f35cd5d2a98d54a2f1218fcd5dfc5 in VirusTotal\nmatches the behaviors of x32bridge.dat, specifically the creation of the Windows Scheduled\nTask and PDB string referenced in the Sophos blog.\n\nThis file is a Windows x86 PE file (DLL), the in-memory equivalent of x32bridge.dat. Our\nanalysis shows the runtime behavior is identical to the x32bridge.dat USB infection detailed\nearlier, but it has an added capability. It copies documents from the host machine to a new\nhidden USB subfolder named da520e5.\n\nThe malware specifically copies all Adobe PDF and Microsoft Word documents from the host\nto this directory. Figure 14 below shows an example of the directory and files copied from our\nhost.\n\nFigure 14. PlugX malware variant with two exfil files.\nThis PlugX USB malware variant was designed to exfiltrate specific files from its target that\ncould be retrieved later, as this directory and files are not used by the malware or displayed\nto the victim.\n\n## Association With PlugX Malware\n\nIn addition to USB infection, both x32bridge.dat and the second PlugX malware variant\ndiscovered in VirusTotal check the target for specific running processes. If found, it\nterminates them and deletes the directories from which they were executed.\n\nX32bridge.dat seeks out process names starting with AAM and, if found, terminates the\nprocess and deletes specific directories associated with the process. The Sophos blog\nspeculated that this behavior likely removed older PlugX malware variants. Previous variants\n\n\n-----\n\nattributed to PlugX started with AAM file names (i.e., AAM Updates.exe).\n\nThe second variant we discovered in VirusTotal also performs this check, including one for\nthe specific process file name AAM Updates.exe. Additionally, if AAM Updates.exe is found,\nit deletes the directory AAM UpdatesikB, which is a folder that has also been associated with\nthe PlugX malware family.\n\nSince both x32bridge.dat and the second PlugX malware variant discovered in VirusTotal\nshare the same USB infection method along with other runtime behaviors, we can\nconclusively state that it is indeed associated with PlugX.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPlugX malware has been used for over a decade and was historically extensively associated\nwith Chinese nation-state APT groups. Over the years, it has been adopted and used by\nother threat groups, from nation-states to ransomware actors.\n\nThe typical tradecraft of PlugX uses benign files to achieve code execution, also known as\nDLL side loading, that many security vendors now detect and prevent. This might be part of\nwhy the actors added the capability to infect any attached removable media USB devices\nsuch as floppy, thumb or flash drives as well as any additional systems the USB is later\nplugged into.\n\nAny host infected with this variant of the PlugX malware will continuously monitor for new\nUSB removable devices to infect. This PlugX malware also hides attacker files in a USB\ndevice with a novel technique, which makes the malicious files only viewable on a *nix OS or\nby mounting the USB device in a forensic tool. Because of this ability to evade detection, the\nPlugX malware can continue to spread and potentially jump to air-gapped networks.\n\nAdditionally, we discovered a similar variant of PlugX in VirusTotal with the added capability\nof copying all Adobe PDF and Microsoft Word documents from the infected host to the USB\ndevice's hidden folder created by the PlugX malware. The discovery of these samples\nindicates PlugX development is still alive and well among at least some technically skilled\nattackers, and it remains an active threat.\n\nFor Palo Alto Networks customers, our products and services provide the following coverage\nassociated with this campaign:\n\nIf you think you may have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the Unit 42\nIncident Response team or call:\n\nNorth America Toll-Free: 866.486.4842 (866.4.UNIT42)\nEMEA: +31.20.299.3130\nAPAC: +65.6983.8730\n\n\n-----\n\nJapan: +81.50.1790.0200\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared these findings, including file samples and indicators of\ncompromise, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.
