OverWatch’s mission includes using the market-leading CrowdStrike Falcon endpoint\nsecurity platform to detect intrusions by sophisticated or persistent adversaries that might\notherwise go unnoticed, and then providing timely, actionable and relevant notifications to\ncustomers [1].\n\nThis report provides a summary of OverWatch’s findings from intrusion hunting during\nthe first half (January through June) of 2018. It reviews intrusion trends during that time frame,\nprovides insights into the current landscape of adversary tactics and delivers highlights\nof notable intrusions OverWatch identified. OverWatch specifically hunts for targeted\nadversaries. Therefore, this report’s findings cover state-sponsored and targeted eCrime\nintrusion activity, not all forms of attacks.\n\n## INTRUSIONS SUMMARY\n\nOverWatch observed and analyzed numerous intrusion events during this time period.\n\n###### INTRUSION CASES[*] BY THREAT TYPE INTRUSION CASES[*] BY OPERATING SYSTEM\n\n1%\n\n33%\n\n2%\n\n48%\n\n97%\n\n19%\n\nTargeted (State-Sponsored) Windows\neCrime Mac\nOther/Unknown Linux\n\n*Percentages in these graphs reflect only those intrusion cases involving notable sophisticated and/or persistent\n\n\n1 For more information on how Falcon\nOverWatch performs its mission,\nplease see the Falcon OverWatch\nproduct page: https://www.crowdstrike.\ncom/products/falcon-overwatch/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\n PERCENTAGE OF INTRUSION CASES BY VERTICAL\n\nAcademic\n\nAgriculture\n\nAutomotive\n\nAviation\n\nBiotechnology\n\nDefense\n\nEnergy\n\nEngineering\n\nEntertainment\n\nFinancial\n\nFood and Beverage\n\nHealthcare\n\nHospitality\n\nInsurance\n\nInternet Services\n\nLaw Enforcement\n\nLegal\n\nManufacturing\n\nMining\n\nNGO\n\nOil and Gas\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nProfessional Services\n\nRetail\n\nTechnology\n\nTelecommunications\n\nThink Tanks\n\nTransportation and Logistics\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40%\n\nNote: Combined percentages add up to more than 100% because some victims belong to more than one vertical.\n\nWhile OverWatch analyzed numerous intrusions during this period, only some could be\nattributed to an adversary at this time.

Historically, the OverWatch team has seen such actors take advantage of their access\nto steal sensitive information that could be used for financial gain. However, in these cases, adversaries\npursued post-exploitation financial gain by deploying cryptocurrency miners. They employed\ntechniques that allowed them to perform extensive lateral movement, creating as large a foothold\nas they could to commandeer mining resources. It appears that the rise in the value\nof cryptocurrencies during the winter of 2017 led eCrime actors to shift their preferred objectives\nin several cases. Two examples of these intrusions are the following:\n\nIn January, OverWatch observed an unidentified criminal actor installing a number of malicious tools\non compromised hosts belonging to an organization in the legal vertical. These tools included\nthe xDedic[3] RDPPatch tool, the Monero cryptocurrency mining tool XMRig and a disk usage tool\nused for reconnaissance purposes.\n\nRDPPatch allows threat actors to patch the Windows RDP substitution system, which then supports\nmultiple user logins to the compromised host. The RDPPatch binary used in the attack was:\nFILE: C:\\Temp\\3\\Temp1_xrdp.zip\\xRdp.v2.1.exe\n[HASH:  daddc833bffcade36b432b21046487b29dcd2a162d91b503334a52caee9c1fd2](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/daddc833bffcade36b432b21046487b29dcd2a162d91b503334a52caee9c1fd2)\n\nXMRig is an open-source Monero cryptocurrency mining software distributed via a public code\nrepository. During this intrusion, the actor attempted to download and install XMRig with\nthe likely intent to passively generate revenue while the host was not otherwise in use:\nFILE: XMRig 64bit version 2.4.3\n[HASH: 08b55f9b7dafc53dfc43f7f70cdd7048d231767745b76dc4474370fb323d7ae7](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/08b55f9b7dafc53dfc43f7f70cdd7048d231767745b76dc4474370fb323d7ae7)\n\nNOTE: Installed from minergate[.]com/download/win-srv\n\nThe disk usage tool observed was the otherwise legitimate tool, TreeSize[4]. TreeSize provides an\noperator with the ability to easily view disk space usage, which could facilitate actions\non objectives.\n\nIn late January, Falcon OverWatch assisted CrowdStrike Services in responding to an engagement\non the network of an organization in the insurance vertical. OverWatch uncovered widespread\nmalicious activity involving WMI and PowerShell on multiple hosts. Among the extensive telemetry\ncollected during the intrusion were several notable TTPs, including:\n\nAttempts to download Pupy RAT[5] files from\nhttps://54.183.214[.]137:8080/eiloShaegae1 and\nhttps://54.183.214[.]137:8080/IMo8oosieVai\nAccessing the Domain Controller via RDP using valid credentials\nUse of PowerShell for host reconnaissance and credential theft\nCreation of malicious scheduled tasks via Microsoft Management Console\n\nBeyond these behaviors, the adversary also used PsExec to execute a batch file\non numerous hosts\n\n\n3 xDedic is a criminal Russian\nunderground marketplace that brings\ntogether affiliates who want to either\nbuy or sell access to compromised\ndedicated RDP servers.\nThe compromised servers are used for\nactivities such as spam email\nor as VPN endpoints.\n\n4 https://www.jam-software.com/\ntreesize_free/\n\n5 https //github com/n1nj4sec/pupy\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\nAdversary use of PsExec to deploy xpudate.bat to various hosts in an attempt to install\nMonero miners across the victim network.\n\nThe batch script, named xupdate.bat, used PowerShell to download and install a Monero miner:\nFILE: C:\\Program Files\\MSUtil\\x.exe\n[HASH: 85623bf5df6e1ad047bc1b8e94e1db91b922907357251cb7451e1507a38c6426](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/85623bf5df6e1ad047bc1b8e94e1db91b922907357251cb7451e1507a38c6426)\n\nNOTE: Downloaded from https://bread.rumpus[.]press/zwxjwy\n\n#### BLURRED LINES CONTINUE\n\n[A key theme noted in the CrowdStrike 2018 Global Threat Report was the blurring of lines](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2018-crowdstrike-global-threat-report-blurring-the-lines-between-statecraft-and-tradecraft/)\nbetween the TTPs of highly skilled nation-state adversaries and their criminally motivated\ncounterparts. That trend has continued as CrowdStrike saw less skilled criminal actors adopt\nmore advanced TTPs used by well known nation-state actors. One specific manner in which this\nrecurring trend was observed was with the malicious use of TeamViewer software. TeamViewer\nis a legitimate, publicly available remote control software tool[6]. Malicious use of TeamViewer\ncame to light in 2013 when the adversary that CrowdStrike first tracked as TEAM BEAR was\nfound using the software maliciously to facilitate remote access to targets. Malicious versions\nof TeamViewer ensured persistence on victim machines, hid their locations and were configured\nto report to command and control (C2) servers. Since 2013 when TEAM BEAR’s tactics were\npublicly reported, multiple adversaries possessing varying levels of capability and intent,\nincluding criminal, have adopted the malicious use of TeamViewer in their operations. Despite\nextensive public exposure of this known threat, even recently[7], OverWatch continues to see\nthe malicious use of TeamViewer plague organizations across the spectrum of industry verticals.\n\n\n##### The rise in the value of cryptocurrencies during the winter of 2017 led eCrime actors to shift their preferred objectives in several cases.\n\n6 https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy\n\n7 https://blog.avast.com/updateccleaner-attackers-entered-viateamviewer\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, OverWatch uncovered malicious activity leveraging TeamViewer\nspecifically targeting the hospitality sector. At the time of this writing, at least four global\nhospitality organizations were victimized during the quarter. In each case, TeamViewer\nbinaries were masquerading as otherwise expected file names, including msoobe.exe\n(Microsoft Out-of-Box Experience) and jusched.exe (Java Update Scheduler).\nVictims’ TeamViewer config files had also been modified so that TeamViewer network\ncommunications would connect to actor-controlled C2 nodes.\n\nThe malicious TeamViewer activity at each hospitality victim shared overlapping C2\ninfrastructure, indicating a common adversary was responsible. C2 domains observed\nin this campaign were:\n\n[teravisore[.]ru](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/search?query=teravisore.ru)\nvotonafo[.]ru\nsistemappruve[.]ru\nlirubhdk1753[.]ru\n\nIn January, an unknown actor gained remote access to the network of an entertainment\norganization. Among the behaviors observed were WebDAV scans, enumerating SMB\nshares, lateral movement and creating malicious scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe and at.exe.\nThe initial entry, however, was via TeamViewer. The adversary used valid credentials to log\ninto TeamViewer remotely, and then dropped various malicious tools that facilitated\nthe extensive follow-on activity.\n\nAfter gaining initial access to the network via TeamViewer, the actors moved laterally to another\nhost and deployed PlugX using a method that leverages InstallUtil.exe[8 ]to bypass whitelisting.\nInstallUtil.exe is a Microsoft signed binary that can run any .NET executables, bypassing\nAppLocker restrictions while doing so. OverWatch has observed actors exploiting that capability\nby recompiling malicious payloads as .NET executables and running them with InstallUtil.\nThe command line in the Falcon console detection of this event demonstrates the tactic:\n\n\n##### Despite extensive public exposure of this known threat, even recently, OverWatch continues to see the malicious use of TeamViewer plague organizations across the spectrum of industry verticals.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\nAs noted in the image above, InstallUtil.exe executes with a command line employing\nthe following format:\nInstallUtil.exe \"/logfile= /LogToConsole=false /u\" {path to implant}\n\nIn this case, the path to the implant points to a previously unknown InstallUtil.sql file. This\nbinary was dropped by the adversary and further analysis identified it as a variant of\nthe PlugX RAT, which is malware commonly associated with PANDA threat actors. PlugX has\nbeen designed to leverage Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) side-loading[9] to successfully obtain\nexecution, typically via a legitimate and signed host binary. During this event, PlugX was sideloaded by the otherwise legitimate FlashPlayerApp.exe process spawned by IntallUtil.exe\nas shown in the process tree above. The adversary then was able to leverage PlugX to initiate\nthe the interactive cmd.exe shells.\n\n#### IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE\n\nIn March, a business technology solutions organization began deploying the Falcon platform\nacross its network. OverWatch quickly identified evidence of an ongoing, legacy intrusion.\nAn adversary was actively targeting the web-hosting branch of the victim company, resulting\nin successful exploitation of numerous servers. C2 infrastructure included domains and IP\naddresses attributed to WICKED PANDA. Malicious network activity in this campaign was seen\nconnecting to the following:\n\nbackup.aolonline[.]cc\ntiwwter[.]net\nbot.googlecustomservice[.]com\nmall.googlebills[.]net\n[login.googlebills[.]net](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/search?query=login.googlebills.net)\n43.239.159[.]41\n45.32.9[.]211\n[103.84.91[.]78](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/search?query=103.84.91.7)\n103.84.91[.]146\n\nDuring the time of observation, the actor performed limited actions on objectives beyond staging\ntheir custom tools, which included PlugX[10]. In this case, OverWatch assesses with moderate\nconfidence that the victim was not the primary target. Rather, the actor was likely taking\nadvantage of this target of opportunity to build their malicious infrastructure to facilitate future\noperations. An important take-away from this event is the reminder that sophisticated, nationstate adversaries could target anyone as part of a larger operation. OverWatch has observed\nsimilar activity across several industry verticals. As a result, customers in any sector could find\nthemselves in the cross-hairs of targeted adversaries.\n\n\n##### An important take- away from this event is the reminder that sophisticated, nation- state adversaries could target anyone as part of a larger operation.\n\n8 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/\ndotnet/framework/tools/installutilexe-installer-tool\n\n9  https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/\nTechnique/T1073\n\n10 https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/\nSoftware/S0013\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\n#### POLICY NGOs A PRIME TARGET\n\nDuring the last several months, OverWatch has observed multiple adversary campaigns\nagainst policy NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) operating overseas. In the first case,\nthreat actors exploited an external server prior to Falcon endpoint protection deployment.\nOnce Falcon was installed, OverWatch was able to identify active use of China Chopper[11]\non the victimized server when the adversary connected to the web shell. It appeared the actor\nhad long had a foothold in the environment and was returning to perform access maintenance.\nOver the course of an hour, they performed host, account and network discovery operations.\nSpecifically, they tested previously compromised credentials by attempting to connect\nto remote network shares with several valid accounts.\n\nBefore leaving, the adversary wrote files associated with the open-source HTran reverse\nproxy tool[12] in a likely attempt to redirect C2 traffic from additional targets. HTran files were\nwritten to the following locations:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\htran.exe\nC:\\HR\\htran.exe\nC:\\[REDACTED]\\Template\\htran.exe\n\nFalcon endpoint protection customers should be aware that they can turn on Falcon’s\nprevention policy setting to block the Chopper web shell.\n\nA separate and distinct set of adversary activity was also observed against another policy NGO.\nOverWatch discovered artifacts and active beaconing associated with malicious implants\nfollowing installation of the Falcon platform across the victim’s network. The backdoor\nof choice in this case was PlugX. As noted before, PlugX remains a prevalent choice for targeted\nadversaries and historically has been popular among those groups associated with China.\n\nIn this case, the legitimate binary used by PlugX for DLL side-loading was a signed BitDefender\nCrash Handler file:\n\nFILE: C:\\ProgramData\\DSSM\\log.exe\nHASH: 386eb7aa33c76ce671d6685f79512597f1fab28ea46c8ec7d89e58340081e2bd\n\nOnce running, the malicious process was observed making network connections to\nthe following nodes:\n\n46.101.119[.]159:80\n46.101.119[.]159:443\n\nNo further actions on objections were observed. While both of these campaigns against policy\nNGOs involve tactics bearing hallmarks of previously observed Chinese targeted intrusions,\nCrowdStrike has not yet attributed this activity to a specific adversary.\n\n\n\n[11] https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/\nSoftware/S0020\n\n12 https://github.com/zcnhonkerHTran\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\n#### FURTHER TARGETING OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY\n\nOverWatch has observed continued targeted adversary interest in the biotechnology industry\nvertical in recent months. Industrial espionage is the likely motive behind these attacks. During\nthe rollout of the Falcon platform to one such customer in the first quarter of 2018, OverWatch\nwas able to quickly identify an existing breach.\n\nAn unknown adversary had established persistence on an infected host belonging to a senior\nexecutive in the organization. The Windows Registry had been modified to execute the following\nPowerShell commands upon execution of Explorer:\n\npowershell.exe -noprofile Invoke-Command -scriptblock{$path='C:\\Users\\\n\n[REDACTED]\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Network\\log\\inf32.dat';$data=Get-Content\n$path;foreach($cmd in $data){iex $cmd;}}\n\npowershell.exe -noprofile Invoke-Command -scriptblock{$path='C:\\Users\\\n\n[REDACTED]\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Network\\log\\imeins32.dat';$data=GetContent $path;foreach($cmd in $data){iex $cmd;}}\n\nThese commands leveraged script blocks to read and execute each line in inf32.dat and\nimeins32.dat. Analysis of the .dat files revealed them to be keylogger and file extraction utilities,\nrespectively.\n\nIn addition to the key logging and file copying performed by the two malicious .dat files,\nthe adversary also connected to the host to actively perform additional exfiltration.\nOver the course of 44 minutes, the actor employed the compression utility WinRAR (renamed\nas winrs) to create archives of targeted files from within the active user’s home Desktop and\nDocuments directories. The files they targeted were very specific to the highly specialized\nresearch and intellectual property of the victim company.\n\nAdversary use of WinRAR to prepare specific files of interest for exfiltration.\n\nThe archives created were subsequently deleted after exfiltration. As visible in the Falcon\nUI detection displayed above, the operator used WinRAR’s -ta flag to select files by a date\nrange. This is a tactic often observed with nation-state or sophisticated adversaries who are\nmaintaining an ongoing collection effort against an organization\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\n#### TECHNOLOGY SECTOR INTRUSION EXHIBITS CREATIVE EVASION TECHNIQUES\n\nIn March, a persistent and embedded nation-state adversary returned to a victim network\nin the technology sector to perform further intrusion operations. The actors gained access\nvia RDP by leveraging valid credentials. They then demonstrated defensive evasion creativity\nby using the legitimate Microsoft certutil.exe and expand.exe tools to decode binaries\nmasquerading as Windows Update log files. The decoded files turned out to be the following:\n\nFILE: C:\\[REDACTED]\\psping.exe\n[HASH: c8453110682d999223a84146462b0b4fc6979f40a01b60a7b925783b71b2d6ff](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/search?query=c8453110682d999223a84146462b0b4fc6979f40a01b60a7b925783b71b2d6ff)\n\nNOTE: Legitimate SysInternals PsPing[13] tool\n\nFILE: C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Documents\\pie.exe\n[HASH: b072e3a32aea8ba555614ad573364c8469da7023efec984185168733230a45d0](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/b072e3a32aea8ba555614ad573364c8469da7023efec984185168733230a45d0)\n\nNOTE: Spetnik TCPing[14] utility\n\nThese legitimate scanning tools were executed thousands of times to identify open 3389 ports.\nResults of their enumeration activity were written to the following file:\n\nFILE: C:\\[REDACTED]\\a.txt\n\nIn the course of scanning wide swaths of internal network IP ranges, the adversary potentially\nrevealed part of their C2 infrastructure by pinging the external IP address 45.77.233[.]19.\n\nThe adversary was intent on covering their tracks beyond disguising the tools they dropped and\nexecuted. They also removed numerous entries in the Windows Remote Desktop Connection\nClient listing within the victim machines’ registries. They performed further measures to hide\nevidence of their presence by clearing a wide array of log files using wevtutil.exe.

The victim organization had an externally facing SQL server\nthat was unknowingly exploited prior to the victim moving it to the internal network.\nAfter the customer placed it inside their DMZ and installed the Falcon sensor on it, OverWatch\nwas able to identify the intrusion. An unknown, likely criminal adversary was observed returning\nto the victimized server to perform access maintenance.\n\nThe actors initially performed taskkill.exe commands in attempts to kill an array of potentially\nexisting security products. However, their attempts to disable Falcon were unsuccessful.\n(Current versions of Falcon for Windows and Mac include the ability for an organization to set\nadditional safeguards that will help to prevent the sensor from being uninstalled even by users\nwith administrative privileges.) In conjunction with the taskkill.exe commands, the operators\nalso ran cacls.exe to determine permissions for disabling the security tools.\n\nLater, the adversary attempted to deploy a large number of tools to further build on their\nbeachhead within the network. However, Falcon blocked their attempted expansion and\nexposed their use of external IP address 222.186.58[.]186 for C2.\n\nAmong the tools they attempted to use was a privilege escalation tool[15] that exploits\nCVE-2016-0099 (MS16-032):\nFILE: C:\\ProgramData\\as.exe\n[HASH: 33a584a0d4907b063af867fd33cc39362b74e96e72d2ad97db7748131364eab1](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/33a584a0d4907b063af867fd33cc39362b74e96e72d2ad97db7748131364eab1)\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon endpoint protection blocking execution of privilege escalation tool.\n\nOther tools the operator attempted to employ included:\n\nCryptocurrency miner\nSQLCrack[16]\nPacked version of SysInternals PsKill[17 ]\n\nTCP scan utility\niSQL query tool\n\nThanks to Falcon, the impact of this pre-existing intrusion was mitigated and the attackers were i\n\n\n15 https://github.com/zcgonvh/MS16032/blob/master/ms16-032/ms16032.cpp\n\n16 https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/ourservices/cyber-security/productsand-cloud-services/informationsecurity-software/\n\n17 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/\ni l /d l d / i\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\n#### ADVERSARY ATTACKS THINK TANK WITH COMPROMISED TELECONFERENCING SOFTWARE\n\nIn April 2018, Falcon OverWatch detected targeted activity on the network of a think tank\norganization utilizing a set of relatively rare TTPs. The attack began when a user received\na spear-phishing message. The sender, claiming to be a university professor hosting a series\nof webinars for students, asked the targeted victim to join one of the webinars as an expert\nin the class topic of global politics and economics. The victim user proceeded to follow\nthe sender’s instructions to install a teleconferencing application in order to join the webinar.\nUnbeknownst to the victim, the teleconferencing application was actually a trojanized version\nof the legitimate Arcadin Vision Desktop App program. As part of the installation, the victim\ndownloaded and extracted the following malicious files:\n\nFILE: C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Temp1_VisionDesktopApp.zip\\\nVisionDesktopApp.exe\nHASH: 9cbcfb735db96abf9b0774f5311a69bd8bec45beaddae8adb38cae085275d3e6\n\nFILE: C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\VisionDesktopApp\\VisionDesktopApp.exe\nHASH: c76fbf957b158aa78239e3a3bd8f478fe7a35f1237c6f730b57b6b318fc9ddad\n\nDuring subsequent installation, these binaries fetched and executed second stage payloads\nfrom the adversary’s C2 domain anywhereconferencelic[.]com, which the attacker had created\nto spoof the legitimate domain of Arcadin’s teleconferencing service “Anywhere Conference.”\n\nSnapshot of the legitimate “Anywhere Conference” website, spoofed in this attack as anywhereconferencelic[.]com to\ndisguise malicious C2 communications.\n\nFollowing the C2 connections, the actors performed hands-on-keyboard activity. Initially,\nthey carried out brief host reconnaissance, enumerating the local user account and network\ninterfaces. They returned shortly thereafter to drop additional second stage tools, including\nthe following implant:\n\nFILE: C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Roaming\\aylnlfdx.exe\nHASH: 1c02630c75d85a3ae59de0a22d3bb82411957ad2cb93626d54f48138c9b0e9e2\nC2 89 34111[ ]113\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\nThe adversary then attempted to establish persistence via a scheduled task by executing\nthe following command:\n\nschtasks.exe /Create /Sc MINUTE /MO 2 /TN \"Microsoft Windows DataBase Components\" /\nTR \"C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\wdusrv.exe\n\nMinutes later, OverWatch identified the use of a Meterpreter reverse shell attempting to run\nMimikatz, but the operation was blocked by the Falcon sensor. The attacker then downloaded\nan OpenSSL certificate, presumably to secure C2 communications. During this phase, C2 traffic\nto asbisua[.]com was identified, which represents another possible attempt to hide\nthe malicious nature of this activity because the domain closely resembles the website for\nthe legitimate Ukraine-based communications technology distributor, ASBIS. Another defense\nevasion technique OverWatch uncovered was the actor’s use of the Windows “extract”\ncommand to uncompress a malicious .dat file containing malicious files, followed by use\nof the “attrib” command to manipulate the visibility of those files.\n\nThe host targeted in this intrusion belonged to an employee of the think tank who was\nresponsible for event coordination. While there is no evidence to confirm that the affected host\nwas specifically targeted by the actor, OverWatch has observed targeted intrusion adversaries\nfocusing on personnel involved in event coordination for think tank organizations in the past.\nThese individuals are of interest to nation-state actors because they may possess information\nthat could facilitate targeting of events involving key individuals involved in global affairs.\n\nThis campaign bears similarities to another that also used a fake university professor persona\nto facilitate targeting of bitcoin exchanges[18]. Social engineering tactics were used to convince\nvictims to install fake GoToMeeting software. If the victim proceeded to join a staged call,\nthe attackers would claim technical difficulties while carrying out actions on objectives.\n\n#### EXTENSIVE DEFENSE EVASION TECHNIQUES OBSERVED IN INTRUSION AGAINST A UNIVERSITY NETWORK\n\nThe Falcon OverWatch team often sees attempts to breach universities, likely due to the\npotentially valuable research, financial and personal data resources available on those\nnetworks. Academic institutions also have reputations for somewhat relaxed IT security\npostures, providing adversaries with potential opportunities to easily build malicious network\ninfrastructures to facilitate additional attacks elsewhere.\n\nDuring Q2, OverWatch observed an unknown adversary conducting operations against\nAmerican universities. In one case, the attacker employed smbexec[19], an open source tool that\nleverages Samba tools, to provide a PsExec-style shell. Under smbexec, the operator created\na new user account, “SQLDebugger,” and added it to the local administrators group. They also\nperformed reconnaissance and deployed additional tools to dump credentials, including the\nfollowing binary:\n\nFILE: C:\\Users\\SQLDebugger\\Desktop\\gp2.exe\nHASH: 25f236981c13620575967d4e0521539920c6b8eb9140f0fc15d000a36ed157e8\n\n\n18 https://www.slideshare.net/JISC/\nparallel-session-security\n\n19 https://github.com/brav0hax/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\nAfter using these dropped tools, the actors immediately overwrote their malicious files with\na copy of a legitimate Windows DLL:\ncopy c:\\windows\\system32\\crypt32.dll gp2.exe /y\n\nThey then proceeded to delete their executable files from the filesystem. The actors also\ndeleted the user account they had created (SQLDebugger). These efforts at removing artifacts\nfrom the host make recovery and investigation more difficult, and demonstrate a high level\nof operational security (OPSEC).\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the attackers accessed a second machine using recently stolen\ncredentials. Once again, they employed a remote shell but this time they used a different opensource shell known as CACTUSTORCH[20]. The actors changed shells, possibly, because they\nwere concerned their previous one was detected.\n\nCACTUSTORCH was spawned as a scheduled task in the following manner:\nschtasks /create /ru system /sc daily /tr \"cmd /c cscript c:\\windows\\temp\\osww.js\" /tn osww /f\n\nThe adversary then deleted the osww.js file from disk, leaving only the copy running in memory\nvia the cscript.exe process. This again demonstrates the remarkable lengths taken to cover their\ntracks and inhibit response efforts.\n\n#### WICKED PANDA TARGETS MULTINATIONAL RESOURCES COMPANY\n\nOverWatch identified a targeted intrusion in May 2018 impacting a multinational resources\ncompany. The first signs of malicious activity began when a suspicious TeamViewer process\non a victim machine wrote the following DLL, which was then loaded into an Explorer process:\n\nFILE: C:\\Windows\\winmm.dll\nHASH: 32998d564425bb796ad55dc464cb0dbf983c1acd200bfd75a8329b7aeed2e2a3\n\nThis DLL spoofs a legitimate Windows component of the same name by copying its filename\nas well as a large number of exported function names. This allows it to be installed on a target\nsystem in a location chosen so that it will be loaded by legitimate software via a DLL searchorder hijacking technique. When loaded, the DLL acts as a flexible loader for a shellcode\npayload.\n\nAfter its installation, the implant connected to the following adversary-controlled infrastructure:\n\nC2 : newspic.x24hr[.]com\nC2 : 150.109.37[.]160\n\nNOTE: Registered to Tencent Cloud Computing Co. Ltd., Beijing, China.\n\nThe actors used their implant to perform reconnaissance and deploy a number of tools and\nscripts, including the legitimate “dsquery” tool, likely to perform account and permission groups\ndiscovery while attempting to blend in with the native Windows environment. They also dropped\nthe legitimate WinRAR utility and used it to package output from the dsquery tool for exfiltration\n\n\n##### The Falcon OverWatch team often sees attempts to breach universities, likely due to the potentially valuable research, financial and personal data resources available on those networks.\n\n20 https://github.com/\nmdsecactivebreach/CACTUSTORCH/\nbl b/ t /CACTUSTORCH j\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\nAnother malicious file installed during this phase of the attack was the following implant:\n\nFILE: C:\\ProgramData\\DatacardService\\version.dll\nHASH: 54cb25a1d7c71e01920929e834b9376e50636a83ac12f2135730e59c56de72df\nC2 : newspic.x24hr[.]com\n\nIn addition, the adversary installed the following legitimate service file, which was then executed\nas service, and sideloaded the malicious version.dll implant:\n\nFILE: C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\HWDeviceService64.exe\nHASH: bb18c63c1982f5cb99c9b65d2b801e8c1909ad7cd0171326dc0015d6b781b451\n\nNOTE: Legitimate service file\n\nUnder the newly installed implant, the attacker attempted to dump credentials using a variant\nof AceHash[21] as well as the Nishang “Get-PassHashes” function[22], but the Falcon endpoint\nprotection platform blocked these operations.\n\nThe following day, the actor returned to perform network scanning and then employ the\nfollowing binary:\n\nFILE: C:\\System Volume Information\\Cpsx64.exe\nHASH: dc52bdf5e3f71fb9ab3b1730d445287d16d3a3c81f026861247086d7e228792e\n\nThis tool was executed with the following command line as part of a pass-the-hash attack to\nfacilitate lateral movement to three further hosts in the network, as shown in the Falcon UI here:\n\nFalcon UI display of the pass-the-hash attack\n\nA credential-dumping utility was deployed on the additional victim machines and further\nreconnaissance was performed.

Once the victim organization responded by using the Falcon platform to contain the exploited systems, adversary activity ceased.\n\n21  https://jpcertcc.github.io\nToolAnalysisResultSheet/details/\nAceHash.htm\n\n22 https://github.com/samratashok/\nnishang/blob/master/Gather/GetPassHashes ps1\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\n#### THREAT ACTOR EMPLOYS SEVERAL CREDENTIAL THEFT TECHNIQUES AGAINST A SINGLE VICTIM\n\nAnother intrusion OverWatch analyzed this year involved an unidentified adversary targeting\nthe network of a policy research organization. The attacker gained initial access to a domain\ncontroller using valid credentials over an RDP session. The malicious activity included lateral\nmovement attempts to other systems over RDP and SMB shares, as well as reconnaissance\nof the types of research carried out by various staff.\n\nThroughout the attack, the operator placed a high priority on stealing more credentials,\nemploying several TTPs[23] to do so:\n\nCredentials in Files[24]\n\nCredential Dumping[25]\n\nKerberoasting[26]\n\n###### CREDENTIALS IN FILES\nThe actor employed the “Credentials in Files” technique by using xcopy to gather the domain\nGroup Policy Preference (GPP) files from the domain controller’s SYSVOL folder with the\nfollowing command:\n\nxcopy /S /E /C /Q /H \\\\[REDACTED]\\sysvol\\[REDACTED]\\policies\\*.*\n\nThe purpose of copying GPP files is that they can be mined for credentials and other information,\nfacilitating a deeper foothold in the network.\n\n###### CREDENTIAL DUMPING\nThe adversary returned later to perform credential dumping by deploying and executing\nthe legitimate Windows Sysinternals tool “AD Explorer”[27] with the following command:\n\nadexplorer -snapshot \"\" c:\\users\\[REDACTED]\\downloads\\adexplorer\\\\snapshot1.snp\n\nThis utility provides the ability to save snapshots of the Active Directory database for offline\nviewing. Later, the actor accessed a SQL server over RDP using valid credentials and deployed\nthe ProcDump utility to dump memory from the LSASS process, providing the attacker with\nadditional credentials.[28] OverWatch also identified that the adversary connected to a third host\nover a network logon session and attempted to harvest the Ntds.dit file and SYSTEM registry\narchive from a Volume Shadow Copy. The SYSTEM registry archive contains the key required\nto decrypt the Ntds.dit file as well as other sensitive information.\n\n###### KERBEROASTING\nThe Falcon platform also captured the malicious operator downloading and running the\nlegitimate Windows Setspn[29] tool, which searches for service principal names (SPNs)\nover the network’s domain. This information was used in an attempt to compromise credentials\nvia Kerberoasting. Kerberoasting occurs when an attacker, using a valid Kerberos ticket-granting\nticket requests one or more ticket granting service tickets for SPNs from the domain controller\n\n\n23These credential access TTPs are\npart of the MITRE ATT&CK model,\nwhich provides an industry standard\nfor understanding and categorizing\nadversary post-exploitation behavior.\nMore information available at https://\nattack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page.\n\n24 https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/\nTechnique/T1081\n\n25 https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/\nTechnique/T1003\n\n26 https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/\nTechnique/T1208\n\n27 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/\nsysinternals/downloads/adexplorer\n\n28https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/\nsysinternals/downloads/procdump\n\n29 https://technet.microsoft.com/pt-pt/\nlibrary/cc773257(v=ws10) aspx\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\nThese tickets may be vulnerable to offline brute force attacks that can expose plaintext\ncredentials. In this case, OverWatch identified the adversary retrieving and executing\na PowerShell script that employed PowerSploit’s Invoke-Kerberoast module, which requests\nservice tickets and returns crackable ticket hashes.\n\nWhile the Falcon OverWatch team commonly sees attempts to harvest credentials during\ntargeted intrusions, this case was unique in the number of techniques observed. The attackers\nclearly placed credential theft as a top priority for their operation, likely with the intention\nof maintaining access to a network they consider a high-value target.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nDuring the first half of 2018, Falcon OverWatch continued to identify and analyze a growing\nnumber of sophisticated and/or persistent intrusions. The technology, professional services\nand hospitality sectors were targeted most often, but government-sponsored and criminal\nadversaries attacked victims across a wide range of industries. The actors used a variety\nof techniques, demonstrating particular creativity and perseverance in defense-evasion and\ncredential-access TTPs. OverWatch sees no evidence suggesting these trends will EDR\nchange significantly over the next several months.\n\nThreat hunting across detailed endpoint data, such as that collected by EDR (endpoint detection\nand response) tools like CrowdStrike Falcon, is invaluable in identifying stealthy adversaries\nusing these types of TTPs and evasions. All organizations that are at risk from these threats\nshould deploy threat hunting teams — internal or MDR services like Falcon OverWatch — to\nrapidly detect, investigate and remediate intrusions before adversaries can accomplish their\nobjective and cause a data breach.\n\nOne of the key metrics that CrowdStrike OverWatch tracks for all intrusions it identifies\nis breakout time, the time it takes for an intruder to begin moving laterally outside of the initial\nbeachhead to other systems in the network. The current average breakout time is 1 hour and 58\nminutes, which means that if defenders are able to detect, investigate and remediate\nthe intrusion within 2 hours, they can stop the adversary before they can cause serious damage.\nCrowdStrike recommends that all organizations adopt the \"1-10-60\" rule:\n\nStrive to detect a threat in 1 minute on average\nInvestigate the detection in 10 minutes\nRemediate and contain the attack in 1 hour\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONT LINES OF THREAT HUNTING\n\n## APPENDIX\n\n#### CROWDSTRIKE FALCON OVERWATCH INTRUSIONS MAPPED TO
