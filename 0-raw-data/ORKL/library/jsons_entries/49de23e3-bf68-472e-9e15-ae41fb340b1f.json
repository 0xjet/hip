Like most infostealing Trojans, Evrial can steal browser\ncookies and stored credentials, but this Trojan also has the ability to monitor the Windows\nclipboard for certain text, and if detected, modify it to something else.\n\n[First discovered and tracked by security researchers MalwareHunterTeam and Guido Not](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nCISSP, by monitoring the Windows clipboard for certain strings, Evrial makes it easy for\nattackers to hijack cryptocurrency payments and Steam trades. This is done by replacing\nlegitimate payment addresses and URLs with addresses under the attacker's control.\n\nFresh Evrial sample (at 8/67): [https://t.co/ClNOvw2GbS](https://t.co/ClNOvw2GbS)\n\nInteresting that previous versions had 20-30 (or more after some time on VT) detections, with\nonly 2 features. Now it has all the features from Reborn Stealer (previously Ovidiy), and now\nit's under 10...\n\n[🤔@malwareforme](https://twitter.com/malwareforme?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n— MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam) [January 16, 2018](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/953313514629853184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Evrial being sold on criminal forums\n\nAccording to MalwareHunterTeam, Evrial is currently being sold on Russian criminal forums\nfor 1,500 Rubles or ~ $27 USD. In the advertisement, the seller states that after purchasing\nthe product, an attacker gains access to a web panel that allows them to build an executable.\nThis web panel also keeps track of what clipboard modifications have taken place and allows\nan attacker to configure what replacement strings should be used.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Translated Post on a Russian Forum**\n\nIncluded in the advertisement are some sample screenshots of the web panel as shown\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Web Panel Screenshot**\n\n## Evrial takes control of the Windows clipboard\n\nEvrial's most interesting feature is that it will monitor the Windows clipboard for certain\ntypes of strings and replace them with ones sent by the attacker. This allows the attacker to\nreroute a cryptocurrency payment to an address under their control. While clipboard\nmonitoring is common with programs like this, MalwareHunterTeam has told\nBleepingComputer that modifications are much more rare.\n\nFor example, bitcoin addresses are not the easiest string of text to type into a program or\nwebsite. Due to this, when someone sends bitcoins to an exchange or wallet, they typically\ncopy the address that the coins should be sent to into the Windows clipboard and then paste\nthat address into the other app or site that is performing the sending.\n\nWhen Evrial detects a bitcoin address in the clipboard, it replaces that legitimate address\nwith one under the attacker's control. The victim then pastes that address into their app,\nthinking its the legitimate one and not realizing its been replaced, and clicks send. Now when\nthe bitcoins are sent, they go to the attackers address rather than your intended recipient.\n\nEvrial is configured to detects strings that correspond to Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero,\nWebMoney, Qiwi addresses and Steam items trade urls.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detecting Strings in the Windows Clipboard**\n\nWhen Evrial detects one of the supported strings in the clipboard, it will connect to a remote\nsite, upload the original string, and then download a string that it should be used as the\nreplacement.\n\n**Replacing String in Clipboard**\n\nAs the string has now been replaced in the clipboard, when the victim performs a paste into a\nprogram, the attacker's string will be used instead.\n\n## Evrial steals passwords documents\n\nIn addition to monitoring and modifying the clipboard, Evrial will also steal bitcoin wallets,\nstored passwords, documents from the victim's desktop, and a screenshot of the active\nwindows. All of this information will be compiled into a zip file and uploaded to the attackers\nweb panel as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nEvrial will determine the location of Bitcoin's wallet.dat file from querying a registry key. If\nthe key exists, it will then steal that wallet so it can gain access to the victim's bitcoins.\n\n**Find Bitcoin wallet.dat Location**\n\nEvrial will also attempt to steal credentials stored in browsers. The browsers targeted by\nEvrial include Chrome, Yandex, Orbitum, Opera, Amigo, Torch, and Comodo.\n\n**Steal Browser Credentials**\n\n\n-----\n\nEvrial will also attempt to steal credentials stored in Pidgin and Filezilla.\n\n**Steal FileZilla Credentials**\n\nLast, but not least, Evrial will steal cookies & documents found on a desktop.\n\n**Steal Cookies**\n\nAll of this data, plus a screenshot of the active window, will be uploaded to a remote server so\nit can be accessed by the attacker.\n\n### How to protect yourself from Evrial\n\nAt this time it not 100% known how Evrial is being distributed, but the best way to protect\nyourself is to practice good computing habits. Make sure that you have security software\ninstalled, that you scan attachments that you receive using a site like VirusTotal, and that you\npractice good and safe computing habits.\n\nA tutorial on how to use your computer safely can be found here: Simple and easy ways to\nkeep your computer safe and secure on the Internet\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Fake Binance NFT Mystery Box bots steal victim s crypto wallets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-binance-nft-mystery-box-bots-steal-victims-crypto-wallets/)\n\n[Fake Pixelmon NFT site infects you with password-stealing malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-pixelmon-nft-site-infects-you-with-password-stealing-malware/)\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Pixiv, DeviantArt artists hit by NFT job offers pushing malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pixiv-deviantart-artists-hit-by-nft-job-offers-pushing-malware/)\n\n[New powerful Prynt Stealer malware sells for just $100 per month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-powerful-prynt-stealer-malware-sells-for-just-100-per-month/)\n\nAD\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
