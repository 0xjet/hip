In this blog post, we will provide more\ninformation on one of the new groups: TALONITE. The fundamental assessment of threats\ntracked by Dragos is that they are explicitly attempting to gain access to ICS networks and\n_operations or are successful in achieving access, not simply trying to gain access to an_\nindustrial organization. To learn more about ICS threat activity groups and how they’re\n[created, we invite you to read our blog post “Uncovering ICS Threat Activity Groups.”](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/webinar-summary-uncovering-ics-threat-activity-groups/)\n\n**Activity Group: a set of intrusion events related with varying degrees of confidence**\n_by similarities in their features or processes used to answer analytic questions and_\n_develop broad mitigation strategies that achieve effects beyond the immediate threat._\n\n\n-----\n\n[Dragos ICS Cybersecurity 2020 Year In Review](https://www.dragos.com/year-in-review/)\n\n## TALONITE Activity Group Overview\n\nDragos began tracking the TALONITE activity group in July 2019 with operations focusing\non initial access compromises in the United States (U.S.) electric sector. The group uses\nphishing techniques with either malicious documents or executables. TALONITE uses two\ncustom malware families that both feature multiple components known as LookBack and\nFlowCloud.\n\nTALONITE focuses on subverting and taking advantage of trust with phishing lures focusing\non engineering-specific themes and concepts, malware that abuses otherwise legitimate\nbinaries or modifies such binaries to include additional functionality, and a combination of\nowned and compromised network infrastructure. This activity is difficult to track and contain\ngiven the group’s propensity to blend techniques and tactics in order to ensure a successful\nintrusion. There is behavioral and tooling overlap between TALONITE and activity known by\n[some as APT10. Alleged members of APT10 were indicted in 2018.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1121706/download)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Diamond\n\nModel representation of TALONITE\n\n## Detecting and Mitigating TALONITE Activity\n\nTALONITE gains initial enterprise network access via spearphishing activity that leverages\nmalicious documents and executables. The lures (Figure 2) focus on engineering-specific\nthemes and concepts, and distributed malware known as FlowCloud and LookBack.\n\nFigure 2: TALONITE phishing engineering-themed email\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware incorporates multiple components including legitimate items such as\ncertutil.exe from Microsoft that the malware abuses, or malware components items\nmasquerading as legitimate utilities such as the malicious proxy tool GUP.exe, named after\na legitimate Notepad++ executable.\n\nThe infrastructure appears to be shared or reused through the overlapping LookBack and\nFlowCloud campaigns. Dragos previously identified infrastructure associated with LookBack\nand concurrently used in FlowCloud activity. Most items indicate an adversary registering,\nhosting, and maintaining infrastructure on controlled servers. TALONITE registers domains\nmasquerading as legitimate engineering or regulatory bodies and uses mostly adversaryowned and -controlled domains and servers, occasionally using legitimate but compromised\ninfrastructure.\n\nDragos did not observe any lateral movement for TALONITE. Based on the capabilities of\nLookBack and FlowCloud, both of which facilitate various means of credential capture,\nDragos assesses with high confidence that TALONITE lateral movement incorporates\ncredential reuse. Both malware types are Remote Access Trojans (RAT) that contain\ncapabilities to establish persistence within the environment. LookBack malware contains\npersistence mechanisms that add two Windows registry keys to execute legitimate but\nmaliciously modified files when the infected user next logs in.\n\nTo obtain persistence, FlowCloud performs minor operations on the system then launches a\nrenamed copy of the legitimate HTML Help Workshop (hhw.exe) utility from Microsoft.\nExtensive database and related processes are used to capture host data that is stored in\nthose database files in a subdirectory of the legitimate but renamed utility.\n\nThe Dragos Platform incorporates multiple detections and analytics designed specifically to\ndetect credential reuse and malicious logon activity. Such tactics are deployed by multiple\nactivity groups tracked by Dragos, making coverage of such abuse vital for ICS network\nprotection. In the [ICS Cybersecurity 2020 Year in Review, Dragos found that 90 percent of](https://www.dragos.com/year-in-review/)\nits services customers lacked fundamental visibility into ICS environments. This means\nmost ICS asset owners and operators will be blind to threats and lack critical cybersecurity\ndata.

Targeting behavior from July\n2019 through the present strongly indicates that TALONITE is exclusively focused on the\nelectric sector, especially within the United States. TALONITE at minimum represents an\ninitial access and information gathering capability leveraged against multiple entities within\n\n\n-----\n\nthe U.S. electric sector over an extended period of time. TALONITE focuses on U.S. electric\nutilities, with some evidence of capabilities targeting unknown entities in Japan and Taiwan\nprior to 2019.\n\nDragos cannot definitively link TALONITE to any known intrusion set or state interest,\ndespite behaviors and tooling that suggest an overlap with APT10 (also referred to as\n[menuPass and STONE PANDA). TALONITE’s targeting focus on critical engineering, and](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045/)\npower generation and distribution know-how within electric utilities is consistent with a wellresourced adversary with strong long-term interests in industrial control and grid operations.\n\nTALONITE targets U.S. electric utilities for initial access and information gathering. Although\nTALONITE is not associated with any known and deliberate ICS disruptive event,\nTALONITE’s identified behaviors and capabilities do not rule out future ICS-targeting\noperations. While TALONITE’s relationship to People’s Republic of China (PRC) strategic\ninterests is unknown, sufficient information identifies this group as an emerging and serious\nthreat to security in the electric sector.\n\nTo learn more about Dragos and our industrial cybersecurity products and services,\nvisit: [dragos.com/why-dragos.](http://dragos.com/why-dragos)\n\n\n-----",
