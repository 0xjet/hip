However, it is still widely used, notably in Russia.\n\n[As noted in our previous blog on Buhtrap, this gang has been actively targeting Russian](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/04/09/operation-buhtrap/)\nbusinesses, mostly through spear-phishing. It is thus interesting to see them add strategic\nweb compromises to their arsenal. As remote administrator software is routinely used by\nbusinesses, it definitely makes sense for this gang to try to compromise visitors to this site.\nIt’s worth noting that Ammyy’s website lists clients that include the top 500 Fortune\ncompanies as well as Russian banks.\n\n## The compromise\n\nIt appears Ammyy’s website is now clean and serves the malware-free Ammyy Admin remote\nadministrator package, but for about a week, visitors were downloading an installer that\ncontained both malware and the Ammyy product. After investigation, different malware\nfamilies were found to have been distributed through Ammyy’s website. The timeline below\nshows which and when.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The first malware we saw was the lurk downloader, which was distributed on October 26 .th](http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/malware-analysis-of-the-lurk-downloader/)\n[We then saw Corebot on the 29, Buhtrap on the 30th](https://securityintelligence.com/watch-out-for-corebot-new-stealer-in-the-wild/) th, and finally, [Ranbyus and the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/12/19/win32spy-ranbyus-modifying-java-code-in-rbs/) Netwire\nRAT on November 2nd.\n\nAlthough these families are not linked together, the droppers that might have been\ndownloaded from Ammyy’s website were the same in every case. The executable would\ninstall the real Ammyy product, but would also launch a file called either AmmyyService.exe\nor AmmyySvc.exe which contained the malicious payload. Thus, it is quite possible that the\ncybercriminals responsible for the website hack sold access to different groups.\n\n### Buhtrap\n\n[The install package behaves in exactly the same way as described in our previous blog. It](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/04/09/operation-buhtrap/)\nfirst fingerprints the system by looking at software installed on the computer and at what\nURLs have been visited. It then downloads an additional package if the system is deemed\nvaluable. This downloader is signed with the following certificate:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – Downloader’s certificate\n\nWe notified Comodo which promptly revoked this certificate. The downloaded package is\nused to spy on the system and ultimately run code to log all keystrokes, enumerate smart\ncards and communicate with C&C servers. This module has exactly the same functionalities\nas the one that we analyzed previously and is loaded in memory through a DLL sideloading\ntechnique. The main difference this time is that the legitimate application that is used for DLL\n[sideloading is no longer Yandex Punto, but a program called The Guide, a two-pane extrinsic](http://theguide.sourceforge.net/)\n[outliner.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner)\n\nOperation Buhtrap is still ongoing and we regularly see new updates coming from the\n[malware’s authors. This group, in much the same way as the Carbanak gang, is using](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/09/08/carbanak-gang-is-back-and-packing-new-guns/)\ntechniques that we are accustomed to see in targeted attacks. The fact that they now use\n\n\n-----\n\nstrategic web compromises is another sign of the closing gap between techniques used by\ncybercriminals and by APT actors.\n\nIf you downloaded and installed Ammyy Admin recently, your computer might be\ncompromised by one of the malware described above. Since we do not know exactly when\nthe attack started nor if the site is still compromised, we recommend that you take\nprecautionary measures and use or install a security product to scan and protect your\ncomputer.\n\nWe tried to contact Ammyy’s developers about this problem for several days and in different\nways, but did not receive an answer from them. As Ammyy Admin is widely used, we wanted\nto warn its users about this security problem.\n\n_Special thanks to Anton Cherepanov, Peter Košinár and Jan Matušík for their help in this_\n_analysis._\n\n**Indicator** **Value**\n\n\nAmmyy + Lurk downloader\n(Win32/TrojanDropper.Agent.REV)\nbundle SHA1\n\nAmmyy + CoreBot\n(Win32/Agent.RLY) bundle SHA1\n\nAmmyy + Buhtrap\n(NSIS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.NSU)\nbundle SHA1\n\nAmmyy + Buhtrap\n(NSIS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.NSU)\nbundle SHA1\n\nAmmyy + Ranbyus\n(Win32/Spy.Ranbyus.L) bundle SHA1\n\nAmmyy + Netwire RAT\n(Win32/Spy.Weecnaw.A) bundle\nSHA1\n\n\n11657755FAD6F7B8854959D09D5ED1E0DE01D485\n\n92CF622E997F43C208DD3835D87A9B984CE73952\n\n44769DD6A5291D1EAC79E78FEE3ED1F147990120\n\n39CE37DC0E3009E536416F5CE25C0E538CBE41E0\n\n2A336AC995B6526529E01EB6303E229E40D99763\n\n10C22B70899E0F0B741C8E10964E663EBD73F4FD\n\n\nCertificate thumbprint 71 49 30 ac cf 5d 9a 7f fc d7 8c 0b 58 aa a5 a7 95 38\n51 be\n\nCertificate serial number 00 8b 2f fa 23 26 66 36 f2 30 77 82 66 bb 32 41 47\n\n\nBuhtrap downloaded package\n(Win32/RA-based.AB) SHA1\n\n\n07F0B293F29EF13C61B33453E50C8C79C69BF22B\n\n\nBuhtrap downloaded package URL http://shevi-reg.com/bor/notepad.cab\n\n\n-----\n\n11 Nov 2015 - 02:49PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
