This threat actor\nextensively uses the watering-hole attack for compromising social engineering websites to deliver\nmalware payloads. It carries out cyber espionage activities that targets organizations of interest to\nthe Vietnamese Government. In the recent past, the OceanLotus APT group has had strong focus\non South East Asian countries like the Philippines, Laos and Cambodia.\n\nThe compromised websites have functionalities like profiling users, redirecting to exploit landing\npage, and are being leveraged to serve malware payloads for Windows and OSX. As per open\nsource intelligence, it was observed that the OceanLotus APT group has leveraged multiple fake\nnews websites to target users.\n\nIn this post we will shed light on one of the latest campaigns of the threat actor with suspected ties\nto the Vietnamese Government. Cyble discovered that the OceanLotus APT group used an RAR\narchive named “Adobe_Flash_Install.rar” to pretend to be an adobe installation, followed by the\n_silent execution of malware payload. The figure below shows the contents of archive file._\n\nFurther research revealed that the threat actor group has used cloud storage like Google Drive to\nhost malware payload files. The Hook diagram below shows that malware payload file is hosted on\nthe dropbox link “hxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/s/puhwqhjcvn2xuum/Adobe_Flash_Install[.]rar?dl=1″.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Analysis:\n\nAs discussed above, the RAR file contains Adobe_Flash_Install.exe and goopdate.dll. The file\nnamed “Adobe_Flash_Install.exe” is a legitimate Google update utility used in the side-loading of\nthe malicious dynamic link library named “goopdate.dll” from the attacker. The version information\nof file provides more insight about the Installer, as shown in the figure below.\n\nUpon execution, the installer side-loads and executes the attacker DLL through the search order\nhijacking method. The process explorer figure below clearly shows the DLL loaded by a legitimate\nGoogle Update utility.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker DLL is heavily packed using custom packer as seen in the Hex view of Entry point\nbytes and data section as depicted in the image below.\n\nThe obfuscated attacker DLL is responsible for loading and executing the Cobalt Strike stager into\nthe memory, followed by its execution. This DLL contains several configuration strings encoded\nwith a simple xor encryption, and these strings include C2 url, browser information and cookie\ndetail etc,.\n\nAt the time of our analysis, we observed that the Cobalt Strike stager tries to download and execute\na shellcode from a remote server that has links to the URL “summerevent.webhop[.]net/f2JZ”. The\n_debugger image attached below shows the hardcoded C2 domain that is decoded during the_\n_runtime._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload file has interesting functionalities like the capturing of victim system information as in\nthe debugger view below.\n\nThe network capture depicts multiple connection requests to the attacker C2 server\n(summerevent.webhop[.]net) as showcased in the Wireshark image below.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe OceanLotus APT group, a threat actor with suspected ties to the Vietnamese Government,\ncontinuously evolves with enriched Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP’s) as it seeks to\ntarget outside of standard spear phishing and leveraging of compromised websites. The threat\nactor has now created its own fake website to deliver payload, which is a clear indication of its\ninclination towards organized cyberattacks.\n\nThe Cyble Research team is continuously monitoring to harvest the threat indicators/TTP’s of\nemerging APT’s in the wild to ensure that targeted organizations are well informed and proactively\nprotected.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise(IOC’s):**\n\nFile hashes (SHA- 256) :\n\n230ac0808fde525306d6e55d389849f67fc328968c433a5053d676d688032e6f- Adobe_Flash_Install.rar\n\n7fd58fa4c9f24114c08b3265d30be5aa8f6519ebd2310cc6956eda6c6e6f56f0 –\nFlash_Adobe_Install.exe(legit Google’s Update utility)\n\n69061e33acb7587d773d05000390f9101f71dfd6eed7973b551594eaf3f04193[goopdate.dll(BackDoor.Meterpreter)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/drweb%253ABackDoor.Meterpreter.164)\n\ncbca9a92a6aa067ff4cab8f1d34ec49ffc9a06c90881f48da369c973182ce06d[Backdoor:Win32/CobaltStrike](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/alibaba%253A%2522Backdoor%253AWin32%252FCobaltStrike.191228%2522)\n\n**URLs:**\n\nsummerevent.webhop[.]net/f2JZ\n\nAbout **[Cyble](https://cyble.io/)**\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves from](https://cyble.io/)\ncybercrimes and exposure in the darkweb.
