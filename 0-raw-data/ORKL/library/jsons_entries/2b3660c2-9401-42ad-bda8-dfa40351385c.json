    "plain_text": "# CryptoCore – Cryptocurrency Exchanges Under Attack\n\n**[atlas-cybersecurity.com/cyber-threats/cryptocore-cryptocurrency-exchanges-under-attack/](https://atlas-cybersecurity.com/cyber-threats/cryptocore-cryptocurrency-exchanges-under-attack/)**\n\nJune 26, 2020\n\nFriday, June 26th, 2020 | [Cyber Threats](https://atlas-cybersecurity.com/category/cyber-threats/)\n\nCryptoCore has established itself as a hidden and persistent hacker group that has been\ntargeting cryptocurrency exchanges, mainly in the US and Japan, since 2018, effectively\nstealing millions’ worth of cryptocurrencies. Their main targets have been almost exclusively\nexchanges and companies working with them via supply-chain attacks and have netted\naround 70-million US dollars from its attacks. ClearSky Cyber Security has been tracking the\ngroup for nearly two years and notes that the group has maintained steady activity ranging\nas far back as May 2018, while their activity has seemingly slowed down in the first half of\n2020, ClearSky attributes this to the COVID-19 pandemic rather than the group’s\ndisbandment. While there doesn’t exist much evidence to the group’s origins, ClearSky is\nrelatively confident that the threat actor has links to the East European region, specifically\nUkraine, Russia, or Romania.\n\nThe main motivation behind their attacks is to gain access to the cryptocurrency exchanges’\nwallets, whether it be general corporate wallets or wallets belonging to the exchanges’\nemployees. They begin their attacks with an extensive reconnaissance phase against the\ncompany and its employees, ranging from executives to IT personnel. Their main avenue for\ninfiltration is through spear-phishing, typically targeting the executives’ personal email\naccounts first, but this is sometimes an optional phase and they will instead simply target\ncorporate email accounts instead of personal. These phishing emails are typically crafted to\nappear from a high-ranking supervisor within the target’s own organization or from another\norganization, such as an advisory board, with connections to the target organization.\n\nAfter gaining initial foothold, CryptoCore then attempts to access the victim’s password\nmanager account as this is where the keys of crypto-wallets and other valuable assets – to\nbe used during the lateral movement stages – are stored. The threat actor will remain\nundetected and maintain persistence until the multi-factor authentication of the exchange\nwallets will be removed, ClearSky suspects that the group utilizes Mimikatz for credential\nharvesting. Once that is achieved, the group will act immediately in stealing the\ncryptocurrency within the wallets.\n\nSome of the CryptoCore’s main characteristics are:\n\n\n-----\n\nPersistence and adherence to same general TTPs and targets\n\nThe group maintains the same general infection avenue, reconnaissance, and\npost-exploitation behaviors, while also changing the format of their bait document,\nspoofed webpages, and specific tools used; their naming convention for their\ndocuments and even some payloads also remain consistent between campaigns.\nThey group also seems to be reluctant to “give up” on a target, attacking the\nsame exchange until they are successful.\nUse of Cloud services such as Google Drive\n\nGoogle Drive is often used by the group to store their files, specifically their bait\ndocuments, with some phishing emails containing links directly to Google Drive or\nto a spoofed version. They do not limit themselves specifically to Google Drive,\nbut it is their most utilized hosting service.\nUse of malicious cryptocurrency-themed domains\n\nSuch as btcprime[.]tk, krypitalvc[.]com, blockchaintransparency[.]institute, etc.\nUse of bit.ly URL shortening service\n\nHaving two main advantages for the CryptoCore group: the ability to mask\nsuspiciously looking links behind a neutral bit.ly link and providing the attacker\nwith click statistics to track the number of potential infections; bit.ly is widely used\nby the threat actor for its communications and the deployment of scripts and files\nfor further infection.\nUse of LNK shortcuts as downloads\n\nThe attacker is known to hide LNK shortcuts behind icons and titles of other file\ntypes, mostly text files. Whether it be a password file needed to access the main\ndocument or the main document itself that is the shortcut, but LNK files are widely\nutilized by the group. These files are used to connect to the command and control\n(C2) server and download next-stage files.\nUse of Visual Basic Script (VBS) files\n\nVBS files are utilized quite heavily by CryptoCore as both downloaders and\nbackdoors. The group’s seemingly main backdoor, named by Proofpoint\nEmerging Threats as ‘CageyChameleon,’ is also a VBS file rather than an\nexecutable or an in-memory payload. The group has been known to utilize the\nMimikatz password-dumping tool as well, so VBS files are not the group’s only\npost-exploitation tool.\nSwiftness and responsiveness\n\nWhile the group has been known to reuse the same infrastructures (domains, IPs,\netc.) they are also quick to register and employ new domains and links. In one\ncase, ClearSky was able to ascertain that a domain being utilized in an attack\nwas only registered for use thirty-minutes prior to the attack.\n\nWhile not much is known about CryptoCore besides their attacks, targets, and MO, there\ndoes exist some information about their internal infrastructure. This evidence includes:\n\n\n-----\n\nUse of Dedicated IP Addresses\n\nCryptoCore operators use dedicated IP addresses where they host their C2\ndomains and these IPs are associated with autonomous systems (AS) located in\nmultiple countries, but located mainly within the US, Taiwan, Brazil, Egypt,\nMongolia, and Thailand (in descending order according to their usage.)\nC2 TLD to Registrar and Nameserver Distribution\n\nThe threat actor mostly registers their C2 domains using the .xyz TLD via\nNameCheap registrar services. Also, the group also registers all dedicated C2\ndomains that are associated with the .info TLD via NameSilo registrar services.\nThese domains typically contain keywords that resemble names of cloud\nservices, possibly with the intention of typo-squatting. The group also frequently\nuses the TLD .com, alongside gTLDs containing relevant words to mislead their\nvictims, such as .email, .services, etc. CryptoCore apparently prefers\nPublicDomainRegistry and NameSilo registrar services but by no means limits\nthemselves to only these two services.\nAnomalous Registration of Multiple C2 Domains in 3 Days\n\nTo this day, the CryptoCore group typically tends to register a new C2 domain\nonce or twice a month, while also not registering multiple C2 domains on the\nsame day, except for one time. Two months after targeting a specific company in\nJuly 2018, CryptoCore registered ten domains within three days, pointing to the\npossibility that the group’s digital infrastructure had been compromised and that\nthey needed to quickly set up a new system in a few days.\nRe-Registering Expired C2 Domains\n\nThis behavior may suggest the attacker’s intent to reuse the same infrastructure\nfor different ongoing campaigns, as well as future ones. There also exists\nevidence that year-old domains are still being utilized by the group and should\nthus remain blocked for long periods.\nUse of DDNS Services Until 2019\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, CryptoCore operators had heavily relied on DDNS services\nsuch as dynu (dynu.com, kozow.com, theworkpc.com), ChangeIP (onmypc.org,\nitemdb.com, itsaol.com) and DNSExit/Netdorm (linkpc.net, publicvm.com). In\n2020, however, ClearSky observed an uptick in registering new domains and\npointing C2 domains to dedicated servers.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of CryptoCore’s indicators of compromise (IOCs) please reference\nthe attached document ‘CryptoCore IOCs.’\n\nSources:\n\n[ClearSky](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CryptoCore_Group.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n[CyberStruggle](https://cyberstruggle.org/delta/LeeryTurtleThreatReport_05_20.pdf)\n\nIt’s important to note that CyberStruggle has dubbed this threat actor as ‘Leery\nTurtle’\n[Safety Internal Reference](https://www.secrss.com/articles/16505)\n\nTranslated from Chinese\n\n## Attachments\n\n[CryptoCore IOCs (535 kB)](https://atlascybersecuritywebsite.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CryptoCore-IOCs.pdf)\n\n[Previous](https://atlas-cybersecurity.com/cyber-threats/wastedlocker-ransomware-demands-millions/)\n[Next](https://atlas-cybersecurity.com/cyber-threats/linkedin-spear-phishing-campaign-targets-aerospace-military-firms/)\n\n\n-----",
