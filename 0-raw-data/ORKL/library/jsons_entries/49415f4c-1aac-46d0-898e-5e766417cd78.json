For more than a century, Australia’s economy has\nsignificantly benefited from the mining industry, with a particularly strong influence in the last\n[decade. Employing over 260,000 people and being valued at more than 200 billion AUD, the](https://lmip.gov.au/default.aspx?LMIP/GainInsights/IndustryInformation/Mining#:~:text=Mining%20employs%20approximately%20261%2C900%20persons,increased%20by%2021.4%20per%20cent.)\nmining industry is the primary contributor to the Australian economy, and in parallel under the\nspotlight for many cybercriminals. As growth of this industry continues to be evident,\ncybercriminals may be seen profiting more and more from the mining companies’ sensitive\ninformation. This industry, once relying almost solely on human work, has now evolved with\nthe digital age to make use of technological support for day-to-day operations – naturally\ncreating more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit.\n\nAustralia’s mining industry comprises numerous companies, however for this research, we’ve\ndecided to look into the top 5 companies to identify the interest of cybercriminals in this\nindustry. The research consists of an overview of numerous cyber threats that we have\nidentified, which if exploited correctly could cause significant risk to this industry. The\nhighlights include:\n\nKELA identified more than 91,000 leaked employee-credentials pertaining to the\n**top 5 Australian mining companies, leaked through third party breaches over the last**\nfew years.\nKELA discovered multiple compromised accounts related to employees in the\nAustralian mining industry, which might provide access to sensitive corporate\n**services.**\nKELA observed numerous network vulnerabilities in the Internet-facing\n**infrastructure of the top 5 companies in the mining industry.**\nKELA detected a compromised network access listed for sale. Upon research,\n**KELA identified that the victim is a company that provides services and stores**\nsensitive data belonging to companies in the mining and energy sector in Australia.\n\n## Practicing Safety Across the Board: Miners Must Maintain Both Physical and Cyber Safety\n\nMining employees are busy in the underground, but what they may not know is that\ncybercriminals are just as busy in their underground cybercrime ecosystem. Diving into our\nsources we’ve identified more than 91 000 leaked employee-credentials pertaining to\n\n\n-----\n\n**the top 5 Australian mining companies. These exposed credentials are email addresses**\nor email:password pairs belonging to mining companies’ employees, extracted from various\nbreached databases constantly traded and circulating in the underground. These databases\nmostly include private and corporate email addresses and associated passwords, including\nplaintext ones. Looking further into this data, we found that these credentials were exposed\nin well-known breaches, such as NitroPDF, Canva, and several others.\n\nThe threats on mining companies’ employees stemmed mostly from third-party breaches on\nvictims unrelated to the mining industry, however we also identified a targeted attack where\n**cybercriminals succeeded in obtaining users’ credentials of a website related to the**\n**mining industry. KELA observed a breached database that was offered on the now**\nunavailable Cit0day shop. Cit0Day.in – a private underground service advertised on hacking\nforums to other cybercriminals – operated as a database-as-a-service market by collecting\nhacked databases and then providing access to usernames, email addresses, and even\ncleartext passwords to other hackers for daily or monthly fees. Due to the automation of this\ntype of market, Cit0day essentially offered actors to trade in much higher volumes but has\nbeen taken down by authorities in late 2020.\n\nHowever, with KELA’s caching capabilities, we were able to identify more than 36,000 user\n**credentials (including email addresses with plaintext passwords) that have been leaked in a**\n**breach of a South African website that provides daily news and updates about mining**\n**around the world. While looking into the domains of the email addresses leaked, we were**\nable to discover that nearly 250 corporate email addresses of Australian individuals were\nleaked, with the majority of those being corporate email addresses for individuals in the\nmining industry in Australia.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Exposed credentials (redacted) that were sold as part of a breached database belonging to a South_\n_African-based site offering daily news and updates about mining activities worldwide._\n\nOne of the recent breaches where we identified compromised credentials of mining\n[companies’ employees was in the Capital Economics breach discovered by KELA. The](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/113581/deep-web/capital-economics-data-leak.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=capital-economics-data-leak)\nexposed data here contained data not only of Australian mining companies’ employees but\nalso data of users all over the world. Due to the fact that the victim – Capital Economics – is\none of the leading independent economic research companies in the world, many of the\nrecords leaked included corporate email addresses, which could be of great value to\ncybercriminals looking to target corporate victims.\n\n## What Value is Seen in Leaked Credentials of Mining Companies’ Employees?\n\nAustralia’s mining industry has seen a vast shift towards automation over the last few years.\nThe systems and processes, controlled by employees in the Australian mining industry, are\nvulnerable and valuable for cybercriminals looking for their next target. Leaked credentials\nlay out a plethora of opportunities for cybercriminals that get their hands on them.\n\nCybercriminals who obtain this data could use it to perform actions such as phishing\n**schemes in order to lure further victims into downloading malicious links to plant**\n**malware. By doing so cybercriminals can eventually infect systems with ransomware that**\ncould disrupt daily mining processes. In a worst-case-scenario, these cybercriminals may\n**use this opportunity to lock systems and prevent mining companies from continuing**\n**operations until a ransom is paid. As learned from analyzing past ransomware attacks and**\n\n\n-----\n\nthe ransom amounts demanded, we ve observed that ransomware groups generally price\ntheir ransom demands based on company revenue. That being said, the ransom that could\nbe demanded from these companies will likely be in the millions, if not more. Other attacks\nthat could be enabled through leaked credentials could be business email compromises,\n**social engineering attacks, and other internal network exploitations.**\n\nWhat is certain is that with leaked credentials circulating in the Dark Net, Australian mining\n**companies are actively at risk. The exposed sensitive data provides cybercriminals with**\nopportunities to cause disruption of activities for long periods of time on Australia’s most\nprofitable critical infrastructure.\n\n## Access to Corporate Services Through Compromised Accounts\n\nWhile leaked credentials pose a significant threat to organizations when utilized correctly by\nthe obtainers, compromised accounts are both easy to purchase and instantly ready to use\nby its buyers. KELA discovered multiple compromised accounts related to employees in the\nAustralian mining industry, essentially providing buyers with access to portals behind\nsensitive corporate domains and subdomains.\n\nCompromised accounts refer to any credentials, cookie sessions and additional technical\n[fingerprints that are available for sale in various automated shops, such as Genesis, which is](https://ke-la.com/exploring-the-genesis-supply-chain-for-fun-and-profit/)\nautomatically monitored by KELA’s technologies. These accounts are stolen from victims’\ncomputers generally via infections by banking trojans or other stealers. Such accounts can\ngrant access to tools and software used in a targeted environment, such as RDP, VPN\nsolutions, and more. They could be leveraged by a sophisticated actor to gain initial network\naccess to the relevant corporate’s network. These markets grant threat actors with access to\ndesired services with the click of a button and at a price of a couple of dollars per bot.\n\nIn our research, we identified that accounts for security token services were compromised for\nthree of the top 5 companies.[1] These services instantly provide cybercriminals with\n**access to the companies’ corporate environments, enabling them to manipulate**\n**security mechanisms within them. Within these compromised accounts, we also identified**\nthat accounts to Active Directory Services were compromised – accounts that can be used to\naccess systems and applications located across organizational boundaries.[2] Upon further\nresearch, we also detected a compromised account that likely leads to the intranet of one of\nthe companies.[3] By purchasing this account, the attacker is instantly granted access to the\n**internal computer network of the organization and gains visibility into internally**\n**shared information by the organization.**\n\n\nLast, we identified an instance of an infected computer that contains details to access a\nmining company’s contractor website. For the same company, the portal used to securely\ntransfer files to clients could be compromised through the bots available for purchase.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe examples of compromised accounts listed above can easily and quickly provide\nattackers with the initial access they need in order to enter the corporate network of these\nmining companies.\n\nUntil now, the examples laid out in this research highlighted threats that are targeting the\nemployees of the industry through leaked credentials or compromised accounts, however,\nwe have also identified threats targeting the companies’ networks and supply chains that\npose a significant risk to their attack surface.\n\n## Mapping Out Mining Companies’ Network Vulnerabilities\n\nKELA identified multiple network vulnerabilities – weaknesses in the Internet-facing\n**infrastructures – pertaining to the top 5 companies of the Australian mining industry.**\nAmong these, KELA identified multiple accessible developer-related environments, that were\neasily detectable by the presence of indicative keywords in the hostnames. When analyzing\nthese hostnames, we found that they require corporate credentials to sign in. By leveraging\nthe tens of thousands of credentials that are publicly circulating, an attacker may be able to\naccess these internal resources by testing out the different corporate email addresses and\npasswords that are exposed.\n\nLast, KELA identified that some of the companies researched are actively operating with\ntechnologies that have known flaws exposed to the public internet. For example, one\ncompany was found to be using version 2.0 of ASP.NET (an open-source web framework for\n.NET) for its contractor system which can be exploited through multiple publicly disclosed\nCVEs.\n\nWhile each threat on its own may seem minimal, the combination of available sensitive\nresources proves to pose a real-time risk to the organizations. In this instance, we were able\nto find both an internal resource that’s publicly exposed to the internet (i.e. the sensitive\nhostname) and the opportunity to gain access to said resources (i.e. the 91,000+ leaked\ncredentials related to these organizations or multiple compromised accounts available for\nsale on automated botnet markets).\n\nDuring our research, we have also identified possible supply chain threats that could affect\nthese and other companies in the Australian mining industry.\n\n## Attack Surface Threats Through the Mining Industry Supply Chain\n\nAs ransomware attacks grow, we’ve been seeing an increasing trend of ransomware-as-aservice, with ransomware operators working together with affiliates and initial access brokers\nto help simplify the infection process. While looking into initial network access for sale related\n\n\n-----\n\nto mining companies, we were able to identify compromised access to an Australian\ninsurance company, which offers services tailored to the Australian mining and energy\nsector.\n\nThe victim whose services consist of protecting businesses in the mining industry from cyber\nrisks was targeted by network exploitation. The threat actor posted this access specifying\nthat he had Citrix access with domain admin privileges for sale and priced it at $2,500. This\nshowcases a typical example of how a buyer can purchase this access to perform lateral\nmovement in order to compromise other areas of the network and potentially gain sensitive\ninformation related to clients – in this case mining companies using the victim’s insurance\nservices.\n\n_Listing of compromised network access for sale belonging to an Australian insurance company that offers_\n_services tailored to the mining and energy sector._\n\n## Summing Up the Exposure of Australian Mining Companies in the Dark Net\n\nAs presented above Australian mining companies play a critical role in supporting their\ncountry’s economy. What mining companies and their employees must understand is that\nthis critical infrastructure is just as important and appealing in cybercriminals’ eyes. With the\nnumerous threat types that we observed in the Dark Net, mining companies and their\nemployees are facing a serious risk that continues to grow as the industry undergoes a\ndigitization process.\n\nThroughout this research we’ve presented numerous threats posed to the employees,\nnetworks, and supply chains of companies in the Australian mining industry. Each threat is\nobviously critical on its own, however when combining several of them, the overall threat\ninstantly becomes more severe.\n\nDuring this research we’ve taken a look at the top 5 companies, however the industry as\nmentioned earlier is the greatest influencer on the Australian economy. The mining industry\nmust be actively mitigating the ongoing threats that are targeting their environment. Based\non the threats listed throughout this research this could mean:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Investing in prioritization of vulnerability patching.\n\n2. Implementing the necessary monitoring tools and systems, in order to be made aware of\nany threats that emerge in real time.\n\n3. Educating employees not only about physical safety – which is something enforced and\nheavily practiced by mining companies – however also about cyber safety, including how\ntheir data should be safely used online, and how to properly identify suspicious activity\n\nBy combining ongoing monitoring with the necessary education and mitigation activities, the\ncompanies within this highly valuable industry can be sure to be one step ahead of attackers\nin order to mitigate threats and thwarts attempts of cyber-attacks against them.\n\nInterested in learning more about how mining companies can proactively monitor their\n[environment and better protect themselves?
