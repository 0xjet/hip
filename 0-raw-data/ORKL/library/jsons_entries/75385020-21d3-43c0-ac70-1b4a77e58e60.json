However, as the\nabove post on their telegram chat group shows they have no intention no of stopping.\n\nThe telegram channel was their only official communication method where they have\npublished stolen data, and in at least one instance, held a vote on who to attack next.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group chat is used to share stolen data (not linked to Lapsus$), tools and requests for\nhacking help. However, the channel is not quite a wild west…there are rules:\n\n1. No porn\n2. Not too much trolling\n3. No spam\n\nBut outside of these rules anything goes…\n\nThe channel is not just for English speakers, there are a significant number of users\ncommunicating in Portuguese. This is potentially a throwback to the first few public victims of\nLapsus$ being the Ministério da Saúde do Brasil (Ministry of Health of Brazil) and latterly\nPortugal’s Impresa media group.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven that the rise of Lapsus$ has coincided with the downfall of Raidforums, a popular\nentry-level hacking forum, it appears that the Lapsus$ chat has attracted a significant\nnumber of like-minded individuals.\n\n[The telegram group still bears the name of its initial victim (https://t.me/saudechat), we can](https://t.me/saudechat)\nassume that it was initially set up to share the stolen data from the Ministério da Saúde do\nBrasil. That has long since passed, but still, the attacks keep coming even after what many\nthought would be arrested that would bring about their downfall. Likewise, the doxing of one\nof the supposed main members of the group has also not stopped their progress.\n\nGiven the naming of the telegram channel, we can assume that their ongoing activity was not\nplanned. One would expect that they are making it up as they go along, thinking barely one\nstep ahead. This may be one reason law enforcement is having such problems shutting them\ndown. There is no plan, victims are targets of opportunity and profit is not the main\nmotivation.\n\nIt has been reported that members of the group originate from the Sim Swapping world, a\nrelatively small sub-section of the hacking community that is specifically focused on illegally\nobtaining control of phone numbers and subsequently control of their linked social media\naccounts. These social media accounts have then been used in several high-profile scams\noften involving crypto. Alternatively, sim swaps have been used to gain control of specific\nusers’ social media accounts due to a unique Twitter or Instagram handle that can then be\nsold in online forums. Much like Lapsus$, individuals arrested in sim swapping are largely of\na similar youthful age.\n\nThis might explain the brazen attacks against mega-corporations and so far their lack of\ninterest in regularly using these attacks for financial gain or at least it does not appear to be\ntheir main motive. Hacks of Okta and Microsoft are by far more valuable than even the most\nhigh-profile Twitter handle. The reasons for these attacks are quite bizarre. The hack of\nNvidia was followed by a demand to remove all Lite Hash Rate (LHR) limitations to its\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU) hash rate that prevents faster crypto mining activities. It\nalso wanted Nvidia to publish the base codes of its GPU drivers as open-source, making\nthem publicly accessible and openly modifiable forever. Neither of these demands would\ndirectly benefit Lapsus$ and seem more targeted at pleasing their fans and enhancing their\nreputation amongst the community.\n\n### How are they doing….what they do!\n\nThere have been a number of in-depth reports on how Lapsus$ has evaded the defenses of\ntheir victims. Researching the group, we discovered how incredibly simple some of their\nmethods were.\n\nThe technical skills and social engineering techniques bear resemblance to those used in the\nsim swapping world, which is after all where they first got started.\n\n\n-----\n\nLapsus$ group put out a call on their telegram channel to employees at potential victim\ncompanies, as seen below:\n\nWhilst this was widely mocked in cybercriminal communities for the lack of hacking prowess\nit takes to recruit insiders to simply give you access, it has been reported that this was in fact\nthe reason Microsoft fell prey to the attack. Lapsus$’s approach may seem less sophisticated\ncompared with advanced threats groups, but as we have witnessed, they are a force to be\nreckoned with. Given that Lapsus$ appears to have used this technique as early as\nNovember 2021, we can easily assume that it has been more successful than reported.\n\nAside from this, Lapsus$ techniques are a throwback to their sim swapping days and revolve\naround social engineering techniques.\n\n### Lapsus$’s methods – they seem so easy\n\n\n-----\n\nSim swapping involves obtaining control of a victim’s phone number by tricking the phone\nservice provider to transfer the phone number and therefore control to another device as per\nthe above illustration. This method requires a significant level of knowledge of potential\nquestions posed by the phone service provider and their requisite and often personal\nanswers. Lapsus$ likely makes use of openly available data through social media and\npreviously breached data to answer these questions.\n\nOnce the number has been transferred, threat actors can then get access to most if not all\nthe victim’s linked accounts through password resetting via the transferred phone number\nwhere the phone number is used as a method of recovery. Email accounts often hold\nvaluable information, including account details, passwords and answers to security\nquestions. Lapsus$ has also been reported to deploy Redline malware, a password and\nsession token stealer.\n\nThere is another avenue much like sim swapping where it requires the threat actor to make a\ncall impersonating the victim. The hacker will call the employee’s IT department and attempt\nto have their password reset. Depending on the security stance of the organization, this often\nrequires answering numerous questions which are personal to the victim.\n\nOnce the victim’s password has been obtained, there is another line of defense.\n\nMultifactor Authentication (MFA) or 2-factor authentication (2FA) comes in many forms as it\nis an additional security measure should a password be leaked or otherwise obtained by an\nunauthorized party. MFA requires the approval or authentication on an additional device to\ngrant access.\n\nOnce an employee password is known, the group would need to pass MFA. Should they\nhave access to the victim phone number and MFA is linked to the compromised number,\naccess can be obtained. If this is not the case, then there are a number of other methods\nthat can be used.\n\n\n-----\n\nSpamming employees with push requests and automated calls to get MFA approval is one\nsuch method. Lapsus$ even brag about this technique on their channel “Call the employee\n100 times at 1 AM while he is trying to sleep, and he will more likely to accept it. Once the\nemployee accepts the call, you can access the MFA enrolment portal and enroll another\ndevice”\n\nWhilst bombarding an employee with MFA requests creates a lot of noise and could\npotentially alert the victim, there are other stealthy methods at play. One such method\ninvolves sending MFA push requests a few times a day, hoping the employee’s guard drops\nmomentarily.\n\nOpting for more advanced MFA such as FIDO2 provides a higher degree of security. FIDO2\nrequires the authentication to be performed on the device that is used to log in, making\nremote logging in on any other device ineffective.\n\nOf course, awareness by employees of these techniques is key. Suspicion should\nimmediately be raised if an unrequested MFA notification is received. Likewise, IT staff must\nremain vigilant to suspicious password resets requests. Staying updated on what is shared\nonline on social media and awareness of any personal data that has been leaked will help\navoid becoming a victim.\n\n### So what’s next from Lapsus$?\n\nAs we have seen, law enforcement coming down on Lapsus$ has not stopped the group’s\nactivities. We can assume a leadership group is controlling the telegram channel rather than\nan individual. One would expect that it is a point of pride that the channel stays up despite\nlaw enforcement action. The group has a plan to use Element.io instant messaging platform\nas a backup should their Telegram channel shut down.\n\nIn the meantime, the channel continues to grow, as Lapsus$ have triumphantly noted that\ntheir telegram chat group now has over 30,000 members. Should the leadership group be\ntaken down, it would not be out of the question for one of these members to form their own\nLapsus$ franchise if they have not already done so. The added humiliation of a multinational\ncorporation being hacked by a group most associated with teenagers doing it for the ‘Lolz’\nwould make the Lapsus$ name an attractive brand.\n\nAPTS have imaginative animals as their mascot, Hacktivists have Guido Fawkes masks, will\nmalicious teenagers use the Lapsus$ name as their logo?\n\nIf we were to illustrate a picture of the Lapsus$ group based on their history and current\ntrajectory, we should draw a multi-headed hydra, each head laughing as Law Enforcement\narrests teenager after teenager, and the regrown heads hack their way through the\nsophisticated defenses of company after company……just for the Lolz.\n\n[Back to Listing](https://www.cyfirma.com/blogs/)\n\n\n-----",
