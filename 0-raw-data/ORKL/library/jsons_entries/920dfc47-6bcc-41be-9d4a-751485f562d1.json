Morphisec researchers began investigating the attacks on\nApril 24 and continue to uncover more details. Initial reports of the attacks, published April\n[26 (in Hebrew) by the Israel National Cyber Event Readiness Team (CERT-IL) and The](https://cert.gov.il/Updates/Alerts/SiteAssets/CERT-IL-ALERT-W-120.pdf)\nMarker, con�rm that the attack was delivered through compromised email accounts at BenGurion University and sent to multiple targets across Israel. Ironically, Ben-Gurion University\nis home to Israel’s Cyber Security Research Center Investigators put the origin of the attack\n\n\n-----\n\nsame infamous hacker group responsible for the OilRig malware campaigns.\n\n\nThe attack was delivered via Microsoft Word documents that exploited a former zero-day\nvulnerability in Word, CVE-2017-0199, to install a �leless variant of the Helminth Trojan\nagent. Microsoft released the patch for the vulnerability on April 11, but many organizations\nhave not yet deployed the update. The attackers actually based their attack on an existing\nProof-of-Concept method that was published by researchers after the patch release.\n\nBy hunting through known malware repositories, Morphisec identi�ed matching samples\nuploaded by Israeli high-tech development companies, medical organizations and education\norganizations, indicating that they were victims of the attack. For security purposes,\nMorphisec is not revealing these names.\n\nThe delivery was executed by compromising the email accounts of a few high-pro�le\nindividuals at Ben-Gurion University. The Word document was sent as a reply to legitimate\nemails sent from those accounts and was propagated to more than 250 individuals in\ndifferent Israeli companies, according to CERT-IL.\n\nUpon deeper investigation into the installed Helminth �leless agent, we identi�ed a near\nperfect match to the OilRig campaign executed by an Iranian hacker group against 140\n[�nancial institutions in the Middle East last year, as analyzed by FireEye, Palo Alto Networks](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html)\n[and Logrhythm. This group has become one of the most active threat actors, with](https://logrhythm.com/oilrig-campaign-analysis-threat-research/)\nnoteworthy abilities, resources and infrastructure; speculations indicate the hacking\norganization to be sponsored by the Iranian government. In other recent attacks (January\n2017), the group used a fake Juniper Networks VPN portal and fake University of Oxford\n[websites to deliver malware as described by ClearSky.](http://www.clearskysec.com/oilrig/)\n\nOur report presents the technical details of the attack, emphasizing differences from last\nyear’s attack. In particular, there are several enhancements to different evasive mechanisms\nand some modi�cations in the communications protocol, which delivers PowerShell\ncommands from the C&C.\n\nThe most important difference is that the use of macros was exchanged with a vulnerability\nexploit. With their ability to set up the attack in a relatively short time, the threat actors could\ncorrectly speculate that their window of opportunity between patch release and patch\nrollout was still open.\n\nAt the time of publication, the C&C servers are still active and will be listed herein as all other\nsignatures and indicators of compromise.\n\n#### TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\n##### Word Delivery\n\nThe different delivered documents, as shown below, are generally named with some\nrandom number <random number>.doc.\n\n\n-----\n\nMorphisec identi�ed the following set of documents:\n\n**Name** **SHA256**\n\n13.doc a9bbbf5e4797d90d579b2cf6f9d61443dff82ead9d9ffd10f3c31b686ccf81ab\n\n558.doc,\n2869664d456034a611b90500f0503d7d6a64abf62d9f9dd432a8659fa6659a84\n2.doc\n\n1.doc 832cc791aad6462687e42e40fd9b261f3d2fbe91c5256241264309a5d437e4d8\n\n3.doc d4eb4035e11da04841087a181c48cd85f75c620a84832375925e6b03973d8e48\n\n##### CVE-2017-0199 Vulnerability Exploit\n\nThe most notable difference from last year’s OilRig campaign is the way the attack was\ndelivered. In the previous campaign, the Iranian group sent specially crafted Excel and Word\n�les, which contained macros that targeted individuals were convinced to enable.\n\n**In this campaign, no macros were required. Each document utilized the vulnerability by**\n**an embedded link that delivers an .hta �le (html executable).**\n\nMorphisec identi�ed the following delivered test<number>.hta �le with the same signature\ndelivered from the following domains:\n\n|Name|SHA256|\n|---|---|\n|13.doc|a9bbbf5e4797d90d579b2cf6f9d61443dff82ead9d9ffd10f3c31b686ccf81ab|\n|558.doc, 2.doc|2869664d456034a611b90500f0503d7d6a64abf62d9f9dd432a8659fa6659a84|\n|1.doc|832cc791aad6462687e42e40fd9b261f3d2fbe91c5256241264309a5d437e4d8|\n|3.doc|d4eb4035e11da04841087a181c48cd85f75c620a84832375925e6b03973d8e48|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name** **Delivery Server**\n\n|test4.hta|hxxp://comonscar[.]in (82.145.40.46)|\n|---|---|\n|test5.hta|80.82.67.42|\n|test1.hta|reserved|\n\n\nSHA256:\n**5ac61ea5142d53412a251eb77f2961e3334a00c83da9087d355a49618220ac43**\n\nThe .hta �le is immediately executed by mshta.exe, the Windows process which executes\nhtml executables. As a result, the user is usually shown a warning message, despite the fact\nthat the HTA is still executed even if the user chooses “No”:\n\n\n-----\n\n[actually disables this message by sending an Enter command to the warning window. This](http://www.morphisec.com/)\nis covered in the next section.\n\n##### HTA Execution and Persistency\n\nThe HTA execution goes through the following steps:\n\n1. Before installing the agent, the .hta �le sends the “Enter” key into the Word application\n\nto remove the warning message and minimize any appearance of suspicious\nexecution. It is done by creating and executing a 1.vbs script.\n\n2. The next step writes and executes the 0011.ps1 PowerShell script, which is described\n\nin the following section.\n\n3. The last step kills the original process that activated the .hta �le, to remove any\n\nsuspicion.\n\n##### Helminth Trojan Installation and Persistency\n\n0011.ps1 script, which is activated by the .hta �le, is in charge of generating the Helminth\nTrojan PowerShell and VBS �les.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|0011.ps1|042F60714E9347DB422E1A3A471DC0301D205FFBD053A4015D2B509DB92029D1|\n|1.vbs|BE7F1D411CC4160BB221C7181DA4370972B6C867AF110C12850CAD77981976ED|\n\n\nMorphisec identi�ed the following structure:\n\n[This structure matches the attack structure from October 2016, as described by Logrhythm:](https://logrhythm.com/oilrig-campaign-analysis-threat-research/)\n\nAside the unique generation of the �les, the structure and the functionality of the trojan is\nvery similar to the previous campaign:\n\n1. The PowerShell script ps1 creates similar variants of Helminth trojan PowerShell and\n\nVBS �les templates (DnS1.Ps1, DnE1.Ps1, backup1.vbs). Those templates are\n**regenerated** on the infected computer by replacement of all variables and function\nnames to random names in order to slow down detection and remediation.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. All the scripts are installed in the Public\\Libraries\\RecordedTV\\ folder.\n3. As in the previous campaign, persistency is achieved by adding a schedule task with a\n\nsimilar name to the Google update task (“GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI”), which\nexecutes vbs every 3 minutes:\n\nNote: All the parameters in the 0011.ps1 script can be recon�gured, therefore some of\nthe names could be different for the tasks and locations.\n\n##### Communication Protocol\n\nWe will focus here on the DnE1.Ps1 �le because all other �les are almost identical to the\nprevious campaign. This �le executes some of the same commands executed by VBS script\nin the previous campaign, but there are differences as well. The script connects to a C&C\nserver – vpsupdate[.]tk. At the time of this report’s publication, the C&C server is still live;\nthe server was �rst registered on April 16, 2017. The goal of the script is to:\n\nDownload bat script\nExecute it and upload the results back to the C&C\nClear traces\n\n\n-----\n\nAt each new activation (�rst) activation of the download command (GET request), the\ninfected computer receives a bat script for activation from the C&C:\n\n**vpsupdate[.]tk/index.aspx?id=<random character><randomnumber>[b] (the “b” is for**\ndownload)\n\nThe �le name of the bat script is then delivered through the response headers, and the\ncontent of the bat script is delivered through the response. Both of them are encoded in\nbase 64.\n\nThe name of the �le is default.bat (decoded from Content-Disposition property in the\nheader) and it is saved temporary in the dn folder (described in the next section).\n\nNote: Morphisec identi�ed several other samples of communication with different C&C\nservers (“alenupdate[.]info” and “maralen[.]tk”) in which a more advanced customized\nversion of Mimikatz was sent to speci�c users, and an additional agent was installed in the\n**“C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Idle\\” directory:**\n\n\n-----\n\nBack to the popular variant of the protocol: As soon as the �le executes and the result\noutput is written to default.bat.txt (similarly to the previous campaign), the resulting �le is\nuploaded back to the C&C using the following URL command (POST request):\n\n**vpsupdate[.]tk/index.aspx?id=<random character><randomnumber>[u] (the “u” is for**\nupload)\n\nAt the same time, the DnE1.Ps1 is executed. The DnS1.Ps1 is also executed and\ncommunicates with the C&C using DNS exchange queries (the same as in the previous\ncampaign). This kind of communication is very hard to block since DNS is a basic\nfunctionality required in any organization.\n\n##### Delivered Commands\n\nThe bat script is a customized version of Mimikatz (with slight modi�cation from the last\ncampaign). Its goal is to gather information from the computer and the network:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe added commands are chcp to handle non-ASCII characters (e.g. Hebrew) and the\nvalidation of the scheduled task (which should have been added by the persistency\nmechanism).\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, Morphisec identi�ed an advanced version of the\nsame bat script communicating with the alenupdate[.]info C&C. In that case, the\ninformation that is gathered includes A.V., Firewall and AntiSpy product information. The\npersistent tasks are slightly different as well, “Google Update Core” and “Google Sync\n**Core”.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Remediation\n\n1. The scheduled task “GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI” should be removed. Note that\n\nregular Google update tasks look like GoogleUpdateTask[Machine|User]* without the\n**“s” in Tasks).**\n\n1. In case “Google Update Core” or “Google Sync Core” exists, those need to be\n\nremoved as well.\n2. Access Public\\Libraries\\RecordedTV folder. Note that the Libraries folder in Public is\n\nhidden, and you should delete the folder and not the RecordedTV icon – if you have\nonly the icon, then the agent is not installed.\n3. If the following directory exists, remove it: “Program Files(x86)\\Microsoft Idle”\n4. If the following directory contains “WinInit.lnk” or “SyncInit.lnk” �les, remove those\n\n�les: “%userpro�le%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\n**Menu\\Programs\\Startup”**\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nEvery few years, a new “logic bug” CVE in OLE object linking is identi�ed; the previous one\nwas three years ago (CVE-2014-0640). This kind of vulnerability is rare but powerful. It\nallows attackers to embed OLE objects (or links in the case of CVE-2017-0199) and bypass\nMicrosoft validation of OLE execution without warning. In essence, it is the same as playing\nanimation in PowerPoint.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Such vulnerabilities should be patched immediately.**\n\nIt is signi�cant to note how the Iranian threat actors advanced their abilities in such a short\ntime:\n\nUtilizing a vulnerability PoC immediately after its publication\nSetting up the required infrastructure with multiple domains and delivery servers\nIncreasing the sophistication of the delivered Helminth agent, including regeneration of\nits signatures on the infected computer\nImproving the customized information gathering Mimikatz version\n\nWith many organizations taking high-risk vulnerabilities seriously and patching them as\nquickly as possible, attackers can no longer exploit them for an extended period of time. We\ntherefore expect that threat actors will return to macro-based campaigns like Hancitor.\n\n#### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n##### Document delivery\n\n**Name** **SHA256**\n\n**13.doc** a9bbbf5e4797d90d579b2cf6f9d61443dff82ead9d9ffd10f3c31b686ccf81ab\n\n**558.doc,**\n2869664d456034a611b90500f0503d7d6a64abf62d9f9dd432a8659fa6659a84\n**2.doc**\n\n**1.doc** 832cc791aad6462687e42e40fd9b261f3d2fbe91c5256241264309a5d437e4d8\n\n**3.doc** d4eb4035e11da04841087a181c48cd85f75c620a84832375925e6b03973d8e48\n\n##### HTA delivery servers:\n\n**hxxp://comonscar[.]in (82.145.40.46)**\n\n**80.82.67.42**\n\n##### HTA �les:\n\n**Name** **SHA256**\n\n|Name|SHA256|\n|---|---|\n|13.doc|a9bbbf5e4797d90d579b2cf6f9d61443dff82ead9d9ffd10f3c31b686ccf81ab|\n|558.doc, 2.doc|2869664d456034a611b90500f0503d7d6a64abf62d9f9dd432a8659fa6659a84|\n|1.doc|832cc791aad6462687e42e40fd9b261f3d2fbe91c5256241264309a5d437e4d8|\n|3.doc|d4eb4035e11da04841087a181c48cd85f75c620a84832375925e6b03973d8e48|\n\n\n-----\n\n**test5.hta**\n\n\n##### Helminth Trojan Installers:\n\n**Name** **SHA256**\n\n**0011.ps1 042F60714E9347DB422E1A3A471DC0301D205FFBD053A4015D2B509DB92029D1**\n\n**1.vbs** BE7F1D411CC4160BB221C7181DA4370972B6C867AF110C12850CAD77981976ED\n\n##### C&C:\n\n**Name**\n\nvpsupdate[.]tk\n\nalenupdate[.]info\n\nMaralen[.]tk\n\n##### Persistency:\n\n**Task Name**\n\nGoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI\n\nGoogle Update Core\n\nGoogle Sync Core\n\n[CERT-IL has listed additional IoCs that are not mentioned in this list, which include the](https://cert.gov.il/Updates/Alerts/SiteAssets/CERT-IL-ALERT-W-120.pdf)\nJanuary campaign that involved malicious Juniper Networks VPN and fake Oxford\nregistration form executables and their C&C domain server.\n\n|Name|SHA256|\n|---|---|\n|0011.ps1|042F60714E9347DB422E1A3A471DC0301D205FFBD053A4015D2B509DB92029D1|\n|1.vbs|BE7F1D411CC4160BB221C7181DA4370972B6C867AF110C12850CAD77981976ED|\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Topics: 0-day exploits, Zero-day, Attack Analysis, �leless attacks](http://blog.morphisec.com/topic/0-day-exploits)**\n\n#### Welcome to our Blog\n\nKeeping you in the loop with company updates, industry insight, cyber security trends, and\ncyber attack information.\n\n### SUBSCRIBE TO THE BLOG\n\n**EMAIL***\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n## Morphisec Named a Cool Vendor 2016\n\nEach year Gartner identi�es new Cool Vendors it considers innovative or transformative.\n[Morphisec is honored be to named a Cool Vendor 2016.
