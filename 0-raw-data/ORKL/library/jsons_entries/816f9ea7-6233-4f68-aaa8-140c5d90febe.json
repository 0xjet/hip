Many of the personas are linked to the fictitious news agency NewsOnAir.org, which reposts and\ncredits themselves with the work of other media outlets to legitimize personas as journalists. While the\nultimate sponsor of this activity is unknown, several indicators suggest it originates in Iran. This incident\nunderscores the threats posed by social networking platforms and affirms that enterprises must take\nsteps to control the human factors that may place them at risk. Though the covert nature of this\ncampaign obscures its impact, successful compromises could be leveraged for diplomatic, military and\nother strategic advantages and possibly even used as reconnaissance for attack.\n\n## The NEWSCASTER Threat\n\nWe believe NEWSCASTER is a long-term, resource intensive cyber espionage\noperation motivated by the prospect of strategic intelligence. Targeting,\nprofessional operational schedule and complexity suggest this activity is\ncarried out by Iranian actors, though there is a dearth of information\nimplicating its ultimate sponsor.\n\n  - Personas are used to directly target several current and former senior\n\nUS military and diplomatic personnel and several specific defense contracting firms in the US and\nIsrael. Though targeting of organizational senior leadership and those associated with the defense\nindustrial base (DIB) are tactics that have been used in hacktivist activity, long-term persistent\nreconnaissance and exploitation of specific targets is inconsistent with actors who intend to\nultimately expose their operations.\n\n  - The activity is carried out from infrastructure previously registered in Tehran and co-hosted with\n\nother Iranian websites. The activity also appears to occur in line with a professional schedule\nfeasible for actors located in Tehran.\n\n  - The network of personas is exceptionally complex, including dozens of accounts with fictitious\n\npersonal and professional material, many of whom claim to work for the news provider\nNewsOnAir.org.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Personas Across Multiple Platforms\n\niSIGHT Partners has uncovered multiple social networking accounts leveraged in a coordinated, longterm cyber espionage campaign since at least 2011. The network of personas is interconnected and\nsupported by an extensive social engineering regimen that crosses multiple social networking platforms\nand websites.\n\n  - iSIGHT Partners has uncovered more than a dozen operational fictitious personas residing on\n\nFacebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other platforms connected to more than 2000 accounts.\n\n**Known**\n**Persona** **Purported Profession** **Known Platforms**\n**Connections**\nSandra Maler Reporter, NewsOnAir LinkedIn, Facebook, 226\nTwitter, Google\n\nAdia Mitchell Reporter, NewsOnAir LinkedIn, Facebook, 281\nTwitter, Wordpress\n\nAmanda Teyson Reporter, NewsOnAir LinkedIn, Facebook, 310\nTwitter, Google\n\nSara McKibben Reporter, NewsOnAir LinkedIn, Facebook Unknown\nJoseph Nilsson Founder, NewsOnAir LinkedIn, Facebook 231\nJane Baker (Ava T.

For example, profiles purporting to be\nassociated with the journalist Sandra Maler of Thompson Reuters used identifying\nprofile images that clearly do not depict the known journalist. In addition, the Alfred\n\n|Persona|Purported Profession|Known Platforms|Known Connections|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Sandra Maler|Reporter, NewsOnAir|LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google|226|\n|Adia Mitchell|Reporter, NewsOnAir|LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Wordpress|281|\n|Amanda Teyson|Reporter, NewsOnAir|LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google|310|\n|Sara McKibben|Reporter, NewsOnAir|LinkedIn, Facebook|Unknown|\n|Joseph Nilsson|Founder, NewsOnAir|LinkedIn, Facebook|231|\n|Jane Baker (Ava T.

The\n\nfabricated NewsOnAir persona of Amanda Teyson used pictures of an Italian national\nreenacting a World War II combat cameraman. The Italian national is friends with the\nAdia Mitchell persona. Pictures used in the Dorotha Baash persona are taken from a\nprofile who is friends with the persona of Jeann Maclkin.\n\n  - Several personas are linked via claims of employment by the fictitious journalism organization\n\nNewsOnAir. The NewsOnAir.org website uses news from other sources and credits it to the\naffiliated personas.\n\n_NewsOnAir.org website_\n\n  - Still others indicate they are members of a Nilsson family, whose patriarch is ostensibly Joseph\n\nNilsson, the persona who claims to have founded NewsOnAir.\n\n  - Additional ties include active social networking connections such as sharing and endorsements\n\nand the reuse of distinctive language in profiles. For instance, several profiles intimated they\nworked with targeted companies using the phrase, \"I've some working between my company\n\n[company they claim to work for] and your company [targeted company].\"\n\n## Targeting\n\nThe network was principally leveraged against US and Israeli targets in public and private sectors,\nthough additional targeting included personnel from the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq,\nAfghanistan and elsewhere. Though it is possible anyone connected to the network was compromised,\ndeliberate attempts to connect with certain entities suggest an interest in political, military, diplomatic\nand technical intelligence. With the exception of personas that appear to be solely used to support the\nbonafides of others, the majority of personas purport to be journalists, members of the military or\ndefense contractors.\n\n  - Several accounts intimated the targeting interest of the actors by creating profiles tailored to\n\ntargeted organizations. In passages in several profiles, the actors defined a relationship between\nthe company for which they claimed to work and the profile's reader, whom they referred to in\nthe first person and whose company they identified. These profiles intimated an interest in US and\nIsraeli defense contractors working in aerospace.\n\n\n-----\n\n_LinkedIn profiles indicated, in first person, which companies were specifically targeted_\n\n  - Social networking accounts were found with extensive relationships to several current and former\n\nflag officers of the US military and senior government officials. The deliberate nature of their\ntargeting was indicated by a long-term process of \"friending\"(or connecting their profiles to)\npeople with whom the target is familiar or intimately related, building bona fides prior to\nultimately friending the targeted person.\n\n  - Entities connected to the network included, but were not limited to:\n\n`o` Several current and former senior members of the military\n`o` Current and former senior foreign policy leaders, to includes those associated with\n\nnuclear non-proliferation and sanctions\n`o` Politicians and bureaucrats at the state and federal level with a particular concentration\n\naround the state of North Carolina\n`o` The US-Israel lobby\n`o` Personnel from at least ten separate US and Israeli defense contractors\n`o` Several other accounts that have no apparent connection to geopolitics or organizations\n\ntypically targeted in espionage activity\n\n  - Of note, a persona using the name Kendrick Babson is inconsistent with the aforementioned\n\ntargeting motivation demonstrated by the choice of associated occupation. While others leverage\nmilitary, DIB or journalist profiles, Kendrick Babson is purportedly an accountant working for a\npayment processor.\n\n## NewsOnAir.org, the Nilsson Family and Supporting Personas\n\nMany of the personas claim to belong to the fictitious news organization NewsOnAir, which has its own\nFacebook and LinkedIn presence and a content-rich webpage setup at NewsOnAir.org designed to\nfurther legitimize the personas. Additionally, several of the personas are members of a fictitious\n\"Nilsson\" family, which includes NewsOnAir's so-called founder. We anticipate that there are several\nsupporting personas that we have not yet identified that were created solely to legitimize other\npersonas.\n\n  - NewsOnAir.org is a website that features news stories updated several times weekly. The stories'\n\ncontent is not original and is taken from other sources such as CNN, Reuters and the BBC. Stories\nare frequently reposted with the bylines of the NewsOnAir personas and reposted to their social\nnetworking sites.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Reuters article, reposted one day later to NewsOnAir.org and credited to Amanda Teyson (her name is misspelled, a_\n\n_common mistake)_\n\n - After new stories are posted to the NewsOnAir site, links to the stories are shared through the\n\nNewsOnAir Twitter account \"@NewsOnAir2.\"\n\n - In addition to Twitter, NewsOnAir maintains a presence on LinkedIn and Facebook.\n\n - In addition to news content, the NewsOnAir website offers apps for download. A weather\n\napplication, a radio application and an application that reminds users to rest their eyes are offered\nthrough the site. The applications are modified to call back to a server controlled by the operators\nwith user details, but no additional functionality was found.\n\n - Several personas claim to be members of the Nilsson family or use the surname Nilsson. Joseph\n\nNilsson, Alfred Nilsson and Josh Nilsson appear to be actively associated with direct targeting, while\nadditional accounts with the Nilsson name appear to have been created to support the bonafides of\nothers.\n\n_High Value Targets (HVT) and Malicious Links_\n\n\n-----\n\n_In Facebook posts, personas intimated their fictitious familial relationships_\n\n## Malicious Activity\n\nPersonas are linked through infrastructure to a number of credential collection sites, which we believe\nare being leveraged to gain access to accounts of targeted personnel. These sites, which at first glance\nappear to be the banal login pages for Yahoo, Google and Outlook Web Access, are linked to the\nNewsOnAir.org infrastructure and can be leveraged to gain covert access to sensitive accounts.\nFurthermore, other connected activity suggests additional, possibly nascent malicious capabilities that\nare being deployed or have previously been used.\n\n  - NewsOnAir.org is connected to credential phishing sites associated with domain com-login.mobi\n\nthrough links to eyeleo.com-login.mobi, offered as an App of the Week through the website.\nOther sites hosted on the domain include:\n\n`o` youtube.com-login.mobi\n`o` login.yahoo.com-login.mobi\n`o` accounts.google.com-login.mobi\n`o` m.login.live.com-login.mobi\n\n_NewsOnAir.Org: A Front News Agency_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Credential collection site that resembles an Outlook Web Access portal_\n\n- Several of the sites hosted on com-login.mobi are fictitious login sites used to surreptitiously\n\ncollect unsuspecting visitors' credentials. The sites, which appear to be Outlook Web Access,\nYahoo and Google login pages, have been leveraged in spear-phishing messages containing links\nthat appear to be banal. The following link was used to send users to a credential collection page\nprior to redirecting them to a YouTube clip posted by the persona Jeann Maclkin:\n\nhttp://youtube.comlogin.mobi/watch.aspx?v=uYvYJtzT8js&feature=youtu.be&f=g&h=http://youtu.be/kxXA\n2_4Yv2A\n\n- EyeLeo and at least two other apps offered for download through the NewsOnAir.org website are\n\nmodified to send victim system information back to IP address 198.20.182.55. However, they do\nnot appear to have any additional functionality.\n\n- An embedded and broken iFrame on NewsOnAir.org pointed to the domain internetexplorers.org.\n\nThe iFrame had an extraneous double quotation mark rendering the tag invalid.\n\n- Multiple IRC malware samples were discovered that communicate with internetexplorers.org,\n\nupdatexplore.com and mcaffeea.com, domains associated through registrants and other\nconnections to NewsOnAir.org. All of the samples used the Persian term \"parastoo\" as a\npassword. Of the IRC malware analyzed, samples were configured to communicate with four\nchannels: \"weather,\" \"radio,\" \"albert\" and \"tistani.\" Notably, two of the apps offered on the\nwebsite are radio and weather related.\n\n- iSIGHT Partners linked the following infrastructure to the activity:\n\n|Domain|IP Address|\n|---|---|\n|com-login.mobi|198.20.182.55|\n|internetexplorers.org|213.152.173.147|\n|updatexplore.com|70.168.71.240|\n|mcafeea.com|184.82.202.248|\n|mediaplayercodec.net|192.69.208.213|\n|fun4us.us|192.69.204.57|\n||46.4.149.236|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain** **IP Address**\n199.26.84.143\n\n## Iranian Origins\n\nTargeting, social engineering ploys, adversary operational schedule and technical indicators suggest this\nactivity has an Iranian origin.\n\n  - In 2011 and 2012, the Adia Mitchell Facebook account \"friended\" multiple accounts associated\n\nwith conservative and North Carolina state politics. The persona proceeded to post awkward\nattempts to engage Facebook friends in conversation regarding Iranian diplomacy, culminating in\nthe posting of an online poll in which friends of the account could participate.\n\n_Early Facebook activity included attempts to engage others on Iranian topics_\n\n  - The distinctly Persian term \"Parastoo\" was used as a password for IRC malware associated\n\nthrough infrastructure to this activity. While the term is not distinct to any operator (such as the\nhacktivist Parastoo) it is distinctly Persian.\n\n  - NewsOnAir.org was previously registered in Tehran, and IP addresses used in infrastructure\n\nalmost exclusively host Iranian content, suggesting hosting was obtained from an Iranian provider\nor intermediary.\n\n  - An analysis of Facebook activity indicates operators maintain regular hours that coincide with the\n\nprofessional workday in Tehran, Iran. Furthermore, activity drops off midday Thursday and\nresumes on Saturday, coinciding with the professional workweek.\n\n|Domain|IP Address|\n|---|---|\n||199.26.84.143|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Activity closely correlated with Tehran professional hours_\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nCyber espionage activity with origins in Iran is not unprecedented. The Mahdi campaign, which largely\nfocused on targets in Iran, the Gulf States and Israel, was attributed by iSIGHT Partners to an Iranian\nactor in 2012. Since then, iSIGHT Partners has tracked additional activity that appears to target Iran's\ndissident population and the US defense industrial base, such as activity attributed to members of the\nAjax Security Team. International pressure and strategic uncertainty have almost certainly created an\nexigent need for intelligence in the country, which has been recently publicly implicated in several\noffensive cyber actions.\n\nGiven the covert nature of cyber espionage, its impacts are often difficult to forecast or measure;\nhowever, in this instance, we expect any accesses obtained by the NEWSCASTER network will be\nultimately exploited for intelligence value. We infer, from our limited knowledge of NEWSCASTER\ntargeting, that such intelligence could ultimately support the development of weapon systems, provide\ninsight into the disposition of the US military or the US alliance with Israel, or impart an advantage in\nnegotiations between Iran and the US, especially with regards to sanctions and proliferation issues. It is\nalso possible that the compromise of such high-ranking and influential people could be used to access\nthe senior levels of as-of-yet unidentified organizations in the US, Israel, and elsewhere. Furthermore,\nwe surmise that access could be leveraged as reconnaissance-for-attack, supporting eventual disruptive\nor destructive attacks against targeted entities. Though there is no evidence indicating the NEWSCASTER\nnetwork was created to support such activity, previous incidents publicly attributed to Iran, such as\nOperation Ababil and the attacks on Saudi Aramco underscore this possibility.\n\nMethods used in this campaign are not novel, but they are brazen, especially when compared with\nshort-term considerably less resource intensive efforts used by other cyber espionage actors. The\npersonal nature of this campaign sets it apart from others and raises concerns that threats to\norganizations and personnel are not limited to enterprise systems or the office—social networking sites,\npersonal accounts and even family members can be a vector for compromise by an adversary who\ncompensates for sophistication with audacious, long-term actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe advise that victims and potential victims of this campaign consider the following course of actions:\n\n  - If you suspect you may be a victim:\n`o` Check for communications between enterprise system and known NEWSCASTER domains\n\nand IPs.\n`o` Check for communications to URLs associated with NEWSCASTER social network accounts.\n\n  - If you determine you are victim:\n`o` Immediately contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation at either your local FBI Cyber Task\n\nForce or FBI CYWATCH:\n\nE-Mail: cywatch@ic.fbi.gov\nVoice: +1-855-292-3937\n\n  - Above all:\n`o` Never directly engage social network accounts.\n`o` Never visit the Newsonair.org website or any other associated sites.\n`o` Never disclose sensitive personally identifiable information on public social network sites.\n`o` Only \"friend\" or \"accept\" invites on social network sites from people who you know.\n`o` Be wary of unsolicited links and confirm their veracity whenever possible.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Annex\n\n**Analysis of IRC Bot**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n  - Analysis was performed on a binary and was found to be an IRC bot.\n\n  - Command and control (C&C) servers associated with the bot family include internetexplorers.org,\n\nupdate.mcafeea.com and download.updatexplore.com.\nChannels the bot attempts to join include #tistani, #Weather, #albert and #Radio. Each channel\nuses the same password: \"Parastoo.\"\n\n  - Victim usernames follow consistent naming convention, such \"t__\" followed by three digits.\n\n**Summary**\n\niSIGHT Partners analyzed a malicious IRC bot. Several samples of the bot were found, all connecting to\nshared infrastructure and using the same password to join channels on the network. From past data, it is\nclear the IRC bot is intended for targeted operations, as the number of simultaneous users (8) allowed\nonto the IRC server at a given time is extremely small.\n\nIn our search, we uncovered samples that communicated with internetexplorers.org,\nupdate.macafeea.com and download.updateexplore.com. The channels the bots attempted to join\nvaried, but the most commonly seen channel was #tistani. Others observed were #Weather, #Radio and\n#albert. Each used the same password for joining the channel \"Parastoo.\"\n\n**Technical Details**\n\n_Execution_\n\nWhen executed, the malware first writes a configuration file to a folder in the TEMP directory. This\nconfiguration file contains a version number, the channel to join, two possible IRC nicks to use, a date\nand an unknown number field. The IRC bot is then copied and executed; a batch file is also written that\nsets the IRC bot's persistence mechanisms via registry.\n\nAfter a period of sleeping, the bot attempts to join the IRC server, join the channel and await further\ncommands.
