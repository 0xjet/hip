    "plain_text": "# Advanced Persistent Threats: A Decade in Review\n\nCommand Five Pty Ltd\nJune 2011\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nThis document defines the term Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) in\nthe context of cyber threats and cyber attack. It presents a timeline and\nsummary of prominent cyber attacks likely attributable to APTs over\nthe past decade. Commonalities are identified and assessed in the\ncontext of the current cyber threat environment. Trends are used to\npredict future APT targeting. APT attack methodology is discussed, and,\nin conclusion, a set of security practices and policies are provided that\ncould help many organisations increase their resilience to APT attack.\n\n\n**DEFINITION**\n\nWhen the term Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is\nused in the context of cyber threats (or cyber attack)\neach component of the term is relevant.\n\n_Advanced_\n\nThe hacker has the ability to evade detection and the\ncapability to gain and maintain access to well\nprotected networks and sensitive information\ncontained within them. The hacker is generally\nadaptive and well resourced.\n\n_Persistent_\n\nThe persistent nature of the threat makes it difficult\nto prevent access to your computer network and,\nonce the threat actor has successfully gained access\nto your network, very difficult to remove.\n\n_Threat_\n\nThe hacker has not only the intent but also the\ncapability to gain access to sensitive information\nstored electronically.\n\n\n**ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS**\n\nAdvanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a well­\nresourced, highly capable and relentless class of\nhacker increasingly referred to in the media, by IT\nsecurity companies, victims, and law enforcement.\nMost hackers target indiscriminately and instead of\npersisting with a particular target draw their focus\nto more vulnerable targets. APTs on the other hand\nare not only well resourced and capable but\npersistent in their covert attempts to access\nsensitive information, such as intellectual property,\nnegotiation strategies or political dynamite, from\ntheir chosen targets.\n\nThe sophistication of APT intrusion attempts\nvaries and likely depends on the attacker’s\nobjectives, the tools and techniques available to\nthem, and the anticipated ability of their target both\nto detect and defend against an attack. The activity\nconducted by APTs is not necessarily sophisticated\nbut the attacker has the ability to upgrade their\nsophistication in order to gain or maintain access to\ncomputer systems of interest. The level of\ncovertness employed may depend on factors such as\nthe anticipated ability of the target to detect the\n\n\nPAGE 1 OF 13\n\n\n-----\n\nactivity, the anticipated response of the target\nshould the targeting be detected, the level of risk the\nhacker is willing to accept, their timeframe to obtain\nthe desired information and the effects on their\nlonger term goals.\n\nThe term APT is commonly used in reference to\nthe cyber threat posed by foreign intelligence\nservices, or hackers working on behalf of such\nentities, but is not limited just to this and can equally\nbe applied to other threat actors such as organised\ncrime syndicates and those involved in traditional\nespionage. Even though some organised crime\nsyndicates are very well resourced and capable, they\nare not usually classed as an APT since they are less\nlikely to persist with attempted access to a\nparticular target. The term is not usually used to\nrefer to the threat posed by an individual hacker as\nthey rarely have a sufficient level of resourcing.\n\nAPTs often target unpublicised vulnerabilities in\ncomputer programs or operating systems using\n‘zero day’ exploits[1]. Typically only well­resourced\nhackers develop such exploits as they are\nexpensive[2], time­consuming[3], and the vulnerabilities\nthey target may be patched prior to deployment\naffecting the value of the investment. In addition,\nzero day exploits are exposed the first time they are\nused and, if detected, may be less effective in future\nattacks. As such, zero day exploits are usually only\ndeployed when the hacker has determined that\nother exploits (that take advantage of publicly\nknown vulnerabilities) will not work on the target,\nor are not expected to work within an acceptable\ntimeframe. Increased use of a zero day exploit may\nalso be observed if the hacker believes their exploit\nhas been detected or the vulnerability it exposes has\nbecome known. This behaviour reflects a desire to\nmaximise the return on their investment before the\nrelevant vulnerability is patched. Zero day exploits\nare commonly used in combination with social\nengineering techniques, to exploit vulnerabilities in\nhuman nature and make the targeting more\neffective. Social engineering techniques are also\n\n1 A ‘zero day’ exploit is a computer attack capability that takes\nadvantage of a software flaw before it is known to the public or\npatched by the vendor, that is, before the first day of public\nawareness of the flaw; on the zeroth day.\n2 On the black market zero day exploits can be worth hundreds of\nthousands or possibly even millions of dollars. (Moyanhan, 2011)\n3 Developing a zero day exploit can take up to several months\neven from the most expert hackers. (Borders, 2007)\n\n\noften used to increase the effectiveness of exploits\nthat target known, but unpatched, vulnerabilities.\n\n**VICTIM REPORTING**\n\nMany of the organisations targeted by APTs are\nlikely unaware they are among the victims. Those\nthat are aware of attacks against them may not\npublicly disclose the fact due to concerns about their\nreputation or share price. Public reports of APT\nattacks date back to at least 1998, when the\nPentagon, National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA), the United States (US)\nEnergy Department, research laboratories and\nprivate universities were targeted. The past year\n(2010/2011) has seen an increase in the number of\norganisations coming forward, admitting they have\nbeen targeted. It has also seen an increase in US\nSecurities and Exchange Commission filings warning\nshareholders about the risks of cyber attack.\n\nThe majority of companies that have come\nforward and admitted they are among the victims\nhave not been forthcoming with the details. This is\npresumably because they do not want to provide the\nhackers with feedback, or cause further\nembarrassment to their organisation. It is\nunfortunate that such potential negative\nramifications of detailed reporting are often seen to\noutweigh the community benefit of sharing lessons\nlearned.\n\n\nPAGE 2 OF 13\n\n\n-----\n\n**TIMELINE OF SIGNIFICANT ATTACKS**\n\nThrough examination of media reports and public\nannouncements a timeline of significant cyber\nattacks likely attributable to APTs can be drawn as\nin Figure 1. In several cases a single operation is\nnamed to refer to a set of similar intrusions, or\nintrusion attempts, affecting numerous targets.\n\n**1998-2000**\n\nMoonlight Maze\n\n**2006**\nUS Congressmen\n\n**2007**\nUS Congressmen (contd.)\nOak Ridge National Laboratory\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\n**2008**\nUS Department of Defense\nOffice of His Holiness the Dalai Lama\n\n**2009**\nGhostNet\nStuxnet\nNight Dragon\nOperation Aurora\n\n**2010**\nStuxnet (contd.)\nAustralian Resource Sector\nFrench Government\n\n**2011**\nFrench Government (contd.)\nCanadian Government\nAustralian Government\nComodo Affiliated Root Authority\nRSA\nOak Ridge National Laboratory\nL­3 Communications\nLockheed Martin\nNorthrop Grumman\nInternational Monetary Fund\n\nFIGURE 1 ­ TIMELINE OF APT ATTACKS\n\n\n**SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ATTACKS**\n\n_March 1998­2000 – Moonlight Maze_\n\nCyber attacks dubbed ‘Moonlight Maze’ targeted\ncomputers at the Pentagon, NASA, the US Energy\nDepartment, research laboratories and private\nuniversities. The attackers successfully gained\naccess to tens of thousands of files. (Arquila, 2003)\n(Central Intelligence Agency, 2007)\n\n_August 2006­2007 – US Congressmen_\n\nThe office computer networks of two congressmen\nwere reportedly compromised. Information is\nbelieved to have been stolen about dissidents critical\nof the Beijing regime. (The Washington Times, 2008)\n\n_29 October 2007 ­ Oak Ridge National Laboratory_\n\nOak Ridge National Laboratory was successfully\ntargeted using emails that were socially engineered\nto appear as though they were legitimate official\ncommunications. Computers were compromised, as\nwas a database which contained information about\nvisitors to the facility. The hackers are believed to\nhave stolen data from the database. (Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory, 2007)\n\n_9 November 2007 – Los Alamos National Laboratory_\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory advised all\nemployees of a recent malicious hacking event that\naffected a small number of computers on the\nlaboratory’s unclassified ‘Yellow’ network. A\nsignificant amount of unclassified data was stolen.\nThe attack is believed to have been part of a broader,\ncoordinated attack against US laboratories and other\ninstitutions. (Anastasio, 2007) (Snodgrass, 2007)\n(Goodin, 2007)\n\n_Early 2008 – US Department of Defense_\n\nThe US Department of Defense suffered a significant\ncompromise of both unclassified and classified\nmilitary computer networks after a foreign\nintelligence agency placed malicious software on a\nUSB flash drive. The device infected a US military\nlaptop upon insertion. The malicious code then\npropagated through US networks infecting\nnumerous computers. (Lynn III, 2010)\n\n\nPAGE 3 OF 13\n\n\n-----\n\n_September 2008 – Office of His Holiness the Dalai_\n_Lama_\n\nA legitimate email was intercepted in transit to the\nOffice of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL) and\nthe attachment replaced with a file containing\nmalicious content. This attack appeared to be part of\na concerted effort in which hackers used social\nengineering techniques to gain access to the OHHDL\ncomputer network. The hackers appear to have\nobtained user passwords through the intrusion and\nlater used these to remotely access the OHHDL mail\nserver. (Nagaraja & Anderson, 2009)\n\n_29 March 2009 – GhostNet_\n\nResearchers released a report detailing a cyber\nespionage operation dubbed ‘GhostNet’ which\ninfiltrated at least 1295 computers in 103 countries,\nincluding those belonging to embassies, South Asian\ngovernments and the Dalai Lama. (Secdev, 2009)\n\n_June 2009 – Stuxnet_\n\nFirst known targeting of an unnamed organisation\noccurred using the Stuxnet[4] worm. The organisation\nwas again targeted in March and April 2010.\nNumerous other organisations, primarily in Iran,\nwere also targeted. The worm appears to have been\npart of a coordinated effort to reprogram a specific\nindustrial control system, such as a gas pipeline or\npower plant, likely located in Iran. (Farlliere, O\nMuchu, & Chien, 2011) (U.S Office of\nCounterintelligence, 2011)\n\n_November 2009 – Night Dragon_\n\nStarting in November, coordinated covert and\ntargeted cyber attacks were observed against global\noil and petrochemical companies. These attacks,\nlabelled as ‘Night Dragon’, used socially engineered\nemails along with Microsoft Windows operating\nsystem vulnerabilities to gain access to computers.\nUsing the access obtained the hackers accessed\ninformation on operational oil and gas field\nproduction systems and financial documents\nrelating to field exploration and bidding. (McAfee\nFoundation Professional Services and McAfee Labs,\n2011)\n\n4 The Stuxnet worm is a malicious computer program capable of\nreplicating itself to infect multiple linked computer systems.\n\n\n_Mid December 2009 – Operation Aurora_\n\nGoogle detected a highly sophisticated and targeted\nattack on Google corporate infrastructure that\nresulted in the theft of intellectual property. This\nevent is believed to have been part of a coordinated\nattack, known as ‘Operation Aurora’, in which\nhackers sought source code from Google, Adobe\nSystems and dozens of other high profile companies.\n(Drummond, 2010) (Zetter, 2010)\n\n_2010 – Australian Resource Sector_\n\nThree major Australian resource sector companies\n(BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group and Rio Tinto)\nwere targeted by cyber attacks. Targeting of Rio\nTinto’s computer network occurred around the time\nof the arrest of Stern Hu in July 2010. (AAP, 2010)\n\n_December 2010­March 2011 – French Government_\n\nThe French Government was successfully targeted\nby a socially engineered email campaign. Over 150\ncomputers in the French Ministry of Economy and\nFinance’s Central Services division were\ncompromised. The hackers were able to remotely\ncontrol the ministry’s computers and retrieve\ndocuments for over three months. The hackers\nsought documents related to the French presidency\nof the G20 and international economic affairs. (Walid\nBerissoul et agencies, 2011) (AFP, 2011)\n\n_January 2011 – Canadian Government_\n\nCanadian Government departments were targeted\nusing emails socially engineered to appear as though\nthey were sent from senior staff members within the\ndepartments. The emails contained malicious\nattachments that compromised Canadian\nGovernment computers and resulted in the theft of\nclassified information. (Postmedia News, 2011)\n\n_February­March 2011 – Australian Government_\n\nAustralian parliamentary computers were accessed\nover a period of at least one month. During that time\nseveral thousand emails may have been accessed\nincluding those of the Australian Prime Minister,\nForeign Minister and Defence Minister. (Benson,\n2011)\n\n\nPAGE 4 OF 13\n\n\n-----\n\n_15 March 2011 – Comodo Affiliated Root Authority_\n\nA Comodo affiliated digital certificate Root Authority\n(RA) was compromised resulting in the issue of\nfraudulent SSL certificates for the popular domains:\nmail.google.com, www.google.com, login.yahoo.com,\nlogin.skype.com, addons.mozilla.org, login.live.com\nand global trustee. (Comodo, 2011)\n\n_17 March 2011 – RSA_\n\nRSA released a public statement advising that they\nwere recently targeted via socially engineered\nemails containing malicious attachments that\nexploited a zero day Adobe Flash vulnerability.\nHackers successfully gained access to the network\nand exfiltrated information including that related to\nRSA’s SecurID two­factor authentication products.\nThe stolen information was later used to enable\ntargeting of defence contractors. (Coviello, Open\nLetter to RSA Customers, 2011)\n\n_Mid April 2011 – Oak Ridge National Laboratory_\n\nOak Ridge National Laboratory was targeted with\nsocially engineered emails tailored to appear as\nthough they were from the laboratory’s Human\nResources department. The emails tricked recipients\ninto downloading malicious software that exploited\na zero day vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The\nlaboratory shut down all internet access and email\nsystems from April 15 to April 17 to ensure no data\nwas exfiltrated before the infection could be cleaned\nup. No large scale exfiltration of data is known to\nhave occurred. (Munger, 2011)\n\n_6 April 2011 – L­3 Communications_\n\nAn L­3 Communications executive notified\nemployees that the company had been actively\ntargeted leveraging information stolen from RSA the\nmonth prior. (gHale, 2011) (Poulsen, 2011)\n\n_21 May 2011 – Lockheed Martin_\n\nLockheed Martin detected a cyber attack on its\ncomputer network. The company’s information\nsecurity team took aggressive actions to protect the\nsystems. No exfiltration of data is known to have\noccurred. RSA has publicly stated that information\nstolen from it in March was used as an element of\nthe attack on Lockheed Martin. (Lockheed Martin\nCorporation, 2011) (Coviello, Open Letter to RSA\nSecurID Customers, 2011)\n\n\n_26 May 2011 – Northrop Grumman_\n\nNorthrop Grumman reportedly shut down remote\naccess to its network without warning and\nconducted an organisation wide password reset,\nraising speculation that it had also been targeted\nusing information stolen from RSA. (Kaplan, 2011)\n\n_May­June 2011 – International Monetary Fund_\n\nAt least one International Monetary Fund (IMF)\ncomputer was compromised in a large and\nsophisticated cyber attack that involved significant\nreconnaissance and utilised software written\nspecifically to target the IMF. The compromised\ncomputer was used to access internal systems and\nfiles. The hackers’ access could have given them\nvisibility of sensitive economic and political\ninformation. (Reddy, Gorman, & Perez, 2011; Sanger\n& Markoff, 2011) (The Guardian, 2011)\n\n\nPAGE 5 OF 13\n\n\n-----\n\n**THE CURRENT CYBER THREAT ENVIRONMENT**\n\nAPTs have targeted governments around the world,\nglobal oil, energy, and petrochemical companies, the\nmining sector, financial institutions, military\ncontractors, the science and technology sector,\ndissidents, critical infrastructure and likely many\nadditional sectors. They have also targeted\ntechnology companies that could enable future\ntargeting. The Operation Aurora attacks, the Comodo\naffiliated RA compromise and the RSA attack set a\nprecedent for such targeting.\n\nThe Aurora attacks appear to have been carried\nout to provide the attacker with source code and\nother information that may allow them to develop\nzero day exploits and rootkits[5] for use on their\ntargets. The certificates generated in the Root\nAuthority attack would likely be of use for future\nstate­driven attacks (despite a lone Iranian\nindividual claiming full responsibility for the attack,\nand stating that there was no government\ninvolvement (Kobie, 2011)). The attack against RSA\nappears to have been conducted to gather sensitive\ninformation to facilitate attacks against\norganisations that use RSA security tokens for two\nfactor authentication; including US defence\ncontractors who work on classified projects.\n\nBased on the trend toward the targeting of\nenabling companies and the increasing popularity of\nvirtualisation, VMware Inc. and other virtualisation\ncompanies seem likely to be among companies\ntargeted by APTs in the future. If unknown\nvulnerabilities in VMware software were discovered\nit could have far reaching ramifications, affecting the\nsecurity of other companies. Especially given the\nincreased popularity of cloud computing which often\nuses virtualisation to separate data belonging to\ndifferent customers. It could also make it easier for\nmalicious software to escape from virtualised\nanalysis platforms and infect connected systems.\n\nEven though details of APT attacks are scarce in\nthe media, the released information is quite\ninformative. Firstly, it tells us that humans are often\nthe weakest link in the security chain and that users\nneed to be better educated on the threat from social\nengineering. Socially engineered email campaigns\n\n5 Rootkits consist of software designed to hide an attacker’s\npresence on a computer system. They can change the way\nmalicious programs are seen by the operating system, making it\nblind to the presence of the malicious programs.\n\n\nare the most common social engineering technique\nused but not the only one. Secondly, it tells us\ntechnology companies need to be better prepared to\nprotect sensitive information that can be used to\nnegatively affect the security of their customers and\nbusiness partners, and undermine the security\nsafeguards put in place.\n\n\nPAGE 6 OF 13\n\n\n-----\n\nTARGET TARGETING METHODS SOCIAL\nENGINEERING?\n\n\nZERO DAYS?

While most victims do not provide\nmany details about the attacks against them, RSA[6] is\none of the few that has provided quite detailed\ninformation. The attack methodology observed in\nthe case of RSA appears to be quite typical. The\ndistinct attack phases are shown in simplified form\nin Figure 3. (Rivner, 2011)\n\n\nReconnaisance\n\n\nMaintenance\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\nData Gathering\n\n\nTargeting\n\n\nFurther Access\n\n\nFIGURE 3 ­ BASIC APT ATTACK METHODOLOGY\n\n_Reconnaissance_\n\nThe attacker passively gathers information about\ntheir target to identify the best targeting method.\nThis may include research into the location of the\ntarget’s offices, the location of their computers,\ntechnologies used by the company, how they\ncommunicate (between offices, with customers,\nsuppliers and shareholders), their employees, their\nemployees’ contact details, interests and contacts.\n\n_Preparation_\n\nThe attacker actively prepares for the attack,\ndeveloping and testing appropriate tools and\n\n6 The attack on RSA is described in a blog post on the official RSA\nblog site; see http://blogs.rsa.com/rivner/anatomy­of­an­attack/\n\n\ntechniques to target their intended victim. This may\ninclude scanning to determine vulnerabilities,\nwriting malicious code or acquiring code, drafting\nsocially engineered emails, determining which email\naccount to send socially engineered emails from,\nacquiring necessary hardware (such as USB flash\ndrives), determining what infrastructure to use to\nlaunch the attack and for command and control\ncommunications, registering for and setting up\nnecessary accounts (email addresses, callback\ndomains etc.) and conducting testing.\n\n_Targeting_\n\nThe attacker launches their attack and monitors for\nsigns of compromise or failure. The sender may\nattempt to connect remotely to a server to exploit a\nvulnerability, strategically place a USB flash drive or\ngive one to a target, send socially engineered emails\nand if possible, check for bounce back notifications,\nmonitor command and control infrastructure for\nbeaconing activity from the victim, try to connect\ninbound to the potentially compromised computer,\nor await feedback from an insider.\n\n_Further Access_\n\nOnce an attacker has successfully gained access to a\ncomputer network they will usually try to identify\nwhere in the network they are and move laterally\nwithin the network to access data of interest and to\ninstall additional backdoors. This will usually\nrequire a return to step 2 (Preparation) and step 3\n(Targeting), the upload of tools and malicious\nsoftware, privilege escalation, network enumeration\nand identification of vulnerable hosts on which to\ninstall backdoors. It may also involve gaining access\nto the domain controller to obtain password hashes,\ncovering tracks by altering logs, and accessing mail\nor file servers to enable data gathering.\n\n_Data Gathering_\n\nOnce an attacker has identified information of\ninterest they will try to gather this information and\nexfiltrate it. They may do this using a ‘smash and\ngrab’ approach, trying to exfiltrate the desired data\nbefore it is detected, or they may opt for a ‘low and\nslow’ approach in which they exfiltrate the data in\nsmall quantities over a longer period.\n\n\nPAGE 8 OF 13\n\n\n-----\n\n_Maintenance_\n\nOnce an attacker has gained access to a network for\ninformation gathering purposes they will usually\nattempt to maintain their access. This may involve\nminimising the amount of malicious activity they\ngenerate on the network to avoid detection,\nperiodically communicating with backdoors on the\nnetwork to ensure they are working as intended,\nand making changes as appropriate. If automated\ndata gathering tools are in use, it may also involve\nmodifying search terms or the exfiltration path,\nvolume or frequency. Maintenance also requires\nmaintaining callback domains and any intermediary\ninfrastructure used to communicate with the\nbackdoors. If access is lost, the attacker may return\nto step 1 (Reconnaissance) or step 2 (Preparation)\nin an attempt to regain access.\n\n**IMPROVING ORGANISATIONAL RESILIENCE**\n\nTo improve resilience to APTs organisations should\nemploy good security practices and policies\nincluding those described below.\n\n_Information Centric Security_\n\nAdopt an information centric approach to security\nby applying multiple layers of security, affording the\nmost sensitive information the most protection. If\npossible store sensitive information offline, or on a\nseparate restricted access network.\n\n_Regular Patching_\n\nRegularly patch operating systems and applications\nincluding document viewers (e.g. Microsoft Office,\nAdobe Acrobat) and web browser plugins.\n\n_Computer Administration Restrictions_\n\nMinimise administrative access and restrict access\nso users do not possess both ‘write’ and ‘execute’\nprivileges for the same folder.\n\n_User Education_\n\nEducate users on the threat from socially engineered\nemails and other forms of social engineering.\nEncourage users to notify IT staff of suspicious\nevents.\n\n\n_Network Access Restrictions_\n\nRestrict which computers can be placed on the\ncorporate network via wired, wireless, and remote\naccess methods.\n\n_Known Network Topology_\n\nEnsure system administrators are aware of the\nlocation of all computers, computer equipment and\nInternet gateways so they can secure the network\n(including wireless access points and 3G USB\nmodems).\n\n_USB Drive Control_\n\nRestrict which USB drives can be used on corporate\nnetworks and develop policies on permitted usage\nand minimum encryption requirements.\n\n_Intrusion Analysis_\n\nConduct intrusion analysis (both host­based and\nnetwork based) to detect anomalous activity.\n\n_Access Control_\n\nEmploy two­factor authentication where possible,\nparticularly on Virtual Private Networks. Restrict\nuser access using least privilege methodology,\nencourage good password control, regularly audit\naccess logs, and review access levels.\n\n_Sender Policy Framework_\n\nEmploy the Sender Policy Framework [7] to help\nprotect against spoofed emails.\n\n7 The Sender Policy Framework is an open standard specifying a\ntechnical method to prevent sender address forgery.
