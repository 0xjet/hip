The developers refer to this tool by the name Kazuar, which is a**\n**Trojan written using the Microsoft .NET Framework that offers actors complete access to compromised systems targeted by its operator. Kazuar�**\n**includes a highly functional command set, which includes the ability to remotely load additional plugins to increase the Trojan’s capabilities. During our**\n**analysis of this malware we uncovered interesting code paths and other artifacts that may indicate a Mac or Unix variant of this same tool also exists.**\n**Also, we discovered a unique feature within Kazuar: it exposes its capabilities through an Application Programming Interface (API) to a built-in**\n**webserver.**\n\n**[We suspect the Kazuar tool may be linked to the Turla threat actor group (also known as Uroburos and Snake), who have been reported to have](https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/2014/02/23968-uroburos-highly-complex-espionage-software-with-russian-roots)**\n**compromised embassies, defense contractors, educational institutions, and research organizations across the globe. A hallmark of Turla operations is**\n**[iterations of their tools and code lineage in Kazuar can be traced back to at least 2005. If the hypothesis is correct and the Turla threat group is using](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/waterbug-attack-group.pdf)**\n**Kazuar, we believe they may be using it as a replacement for Carbon and its derivatives. Of the myriad of tools observed in use by Turla Carbon and its**\n**variants were typically deployed as a second stage backdoor within targeted environments and we believe Kazuar may now hold a similar role for Turla**\n**operations.**\n\n### The Kazuar Malware\n\n**[Kazuar is a fully featured backdoor written using the .NET Framework and obfuscated using the open source packer called ConfuserEx. We used a](https://yck1509.github.io/ConfuserEx/)**\n**[combination of tools such as NoFuserEx, ConfuserEx Fixer, ConfuserEx Switch Killer, and de4d0t in order to deobfuscate the code for in depth analysis.](https://github.com/CodeShark-Dev/NoFuserEx)**\n**[We then used dnSpy to export the code to a Microsoft Visual Studio project, so that we could rename the random method names to better understand](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy)**\n**the flow of the code. We will describe how Kazuar works and what capabilities it offers threat actors.�**\n\n### Initialization\n\n**The malware initializes by gathering system and malware filename information and creates a mutex to make sure only one instance of the Trojan�**\n**executes on the system at a time. Kazuar generates its mutex by using a process that begins with obtaining the MD5 hash of a string**\n**“[username]=>singleton-instance-mutex”. The Trojan then encrypts this MD5 hash using an XOR algorithm and the serial number of the storage volume.**\n**Kazuar uses the resulting ciphertext to generate a GUID that it appends to the string “Global\\\\” to create the mutex.**\n\n**An interesting artifact that we found within the mutex creation process is that if the code cannot obtain the system’s storage serial number, it will use a**\n**static integer of 16456730 as a key to encrypt the MD5 hash. The hexadecimal representation of 16456730 is 0xFB1C1A, which appears to be included**\n**by the malware author as a potential reference to the United States’ FBI and CIA organizations.**\n\n**The Trojan then creates a set of folders on the system to store various files created during its execution. Kazuar creates its folders using group names,�**\n**which logically organize the files contained within the folder. Table 1 shows the folder layout:�**\n\n**Folder** **Files Description**\n**Group**\n\n**base** **Parent folder that contains the following folder groups below**\n\n**sys** **Files that Kazuar uses for configuration settings, such as the ‘serv’ item�**\n**that stores the C2 server locations**\n\n**log** **Files contain debug messages**\n\n**plg** **Files are plugins used to extend the functionality of Kazuar**\n\n**tsk** **Files that Kazuar will process as commands and their arguments**\n\n**res** **Files contain the results of the successfully processed tasks**\n\n**_Table 1 Kazuar’s folder group names and the files stored within�_**\n\n**The Trojan uses a similar process to create these folder and file names as it uses to generate its mutex, generating an MD5 hash of the name, using XOR�**\n**on each byte using the volume serial number as a key and generating a GUID based on the ciphertext. The resulting GUIDs are used as file and folder�**\n**names, which are combined with the local system path to the %LOCALAPPDATA% folder to create Kazuar’s folders.**\n\n**Throughout its code, Kazuar verbosely logs its activities by writing debug messages to log files stored within the “log” folder. Kazuar encrypts the debug�**\n**[messages saved in these log files using the �Rijndael cipher. We decrypted the initial entry that was added to the log files during the execution of the�](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)**\n**Trojan. This entry reveals the following information:**\n\n|Folder Group|Files Description|\n|---|---|\n|base|Parent folder that contains the following folder groups below|\n|sys|Files that Kazuar uses for configuration settings, such as the ‘serv’ item� that stores the C2 server locations|\n|log|Files contain debug messages|\n|plg|Files are plugins used to extend the functionality of Kazuar|\n|tsk|Files that Kazuar will process as commands and their arguments|\n|res|Files contain the results of the successfully processed tasks|\n\n\n**1** **malware_file_name[2720]: Kazuar's** **entry point started in** **process malware_file_name** **[2720]** **as** **user USERNAME**\n\n\n**The log message above shows that the malware author refers to the Trojan as “Kazuar”. Interestingly, the word “Kazuar” appears in several languages,**\n**[such as Polish, Hungarian and Slovenian, and is the ASCII form of the Russian word “казуар”. The word “Kazuar” and казуар translates to Cassowary,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary)**\n**which is a large flightless bird native to New Guinea and Australia as shown in Figure 1.�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1 Cassowary (Source; Wikicommons)_**\n\n**After initial setup, the method at the main entry point of the malware, as seen in Figure 2 may follow one of four main paths of execution. The main entry**\n**point contains a relatively simple set of if statements that determine the execution path of the malware. Interestingly, one of the paths appears to be for**\n**execution on a Mac or Unix host.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2. Main entry point shows if statements that control the flow of execution�_**\n\n**The four possible paths of execution taken by Kazuar’s main entry point are as follows:**\n\n**1. If the malware was executed with the “install” command-line argument, which uses .NET Framwork’s InstallHelper method to install the malware as**\n\n**a service.**\n**2. If the malware is started in a non-user interactive environment (no user interface), the malware installs itself as a service.**\n**3. If no arguments are provided and the malware determines it is running in a Windows environment, it saves a DLL to the system that it injects into**\n\n**the explorer.exe process. The injected DLL executable loads the malware’s executable and runs it within memory of the explorer.exe process.**\n**4. If the malware was executed with the “single” command-line argument or the malware determines its running in a Mac or Unix environment, it runs**\n\n**the method containing Kazuar’s functional code and will limit certain Windows specific functionality if a Mac or Unix environment is detected.�**\n\n**The flow of execution is carefully guided by its operating environment, which is determined using the .NET Framework�**\n**Environment.OSVersion.Platform.PlatformID enumeration, as seen in the function in Figure 3 that is responsible for gathering system specific�**\n**information. Interestingly, we see a specific boolean variable for a PlatformID value of Unix that suggests that Kazuar might be used against Mac or Unix�**\n**targets that return True for that API.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3. The getsysinfo() function provides various environment enumeration capabilities for Kazuar._**\n\n**After enumerating the operating environment, Kazuar will attempt to establish persistent access to the system. Kazuar uses the method displayed in**\n**Figure 4 within its Autorun class to set up persistence on Windows systems, which has multiple options including:**\n\n**1. Adding a shortcut (lnk file) to the Windows startup folder�**\n**2. Adding a sub-key to the following paths in the current user (HKCU) hive:**\n\n**SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run**\n**SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce**\n**SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run**\n**SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell**\n**SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\load**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4. Kazuar’s Autorun class is a Windows specific method that contains multiple options for persistence using the startup folder and registry.�_**\n\n### Command and Control (C2)\n\n**The Kazuar Trojan initially relies on its command and control channel to allow actors to interact with the compromised system and to exfiltrate data.�**\n**Kazuar has the capabilities to use multiple protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or FTPS, determined by the prefixes of the hardcoded C2 URLs. So far,�**\n**we have only observed HTTP used as the C2 protocol in our sample set. All of the known Kazuar C2 servers appear to be compromised WordPress**\n**blogs, suggesting that the threat group using Kazuar in attacks also locates and exploits vulnerable WordPress sites as part of their playbook.**\n\n**To interact with its C2 server, Kazuar begins its communication by creating an HTTP GET request to use as a beacon. The beacon, generated by the**\n**code seen in Figure 5 contains a cookie that has an “AuthToken” value that is a base64 encoded GUID used to uniquely identify the compromised**\n**system. Kazuar refers to this GUID as an “agent” identifier.�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5. The createGET and getWebRequest classes define the construction of the HTTP request used for command and control communication.�_**\n\n**During our analysis, we observed the beacon seen in Figure 6 sent via HTTP from a Kazuar sample to its C2 server. The initial HTTP beacon shows the**\n**base64 encoded AuthToken value within the Cookie field that we believe the C2 server uses to uniquely identify and track individual compromised hosts.�**\n\n**_Figure 6. Wireshark snippet of a fully constructed HTTP GET request which shows the base64 encoded GUID within the Cookie header._**\n\n**Kazuar will read the response from the C2 server and attempt to parse the response as XML formatted data. The XML formatted data will contain what**\n**Kazuar refers to as a “task”, which is comprised of an action identifier and specific arguments for each action. Figure 7 below shows the code�**\n**responsible for receiving the response to the HTTP request and using a long integer stored in the “num” variable as the action identifier.�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7. The response parser listens for new tasks to be received from the command and control server._**\n\n**The action identifier is directly related to the command which the actor wishes to run on the compromised system. Surprisingly, Kazuar also contains�**\n**methods for each command to equate the action identifier to a string that describes the command, which makes determining the purpose of each�**\n**command much easier. Table 2 shows a list of available commands within Kazuar, specifically each action identifier, command string and a description.�**\n\n**Action** **Commands** **Description**\n**ID**\n\n**1** **log** **Logs a specified debug message�**\n\n**2** **get** **Upload files from a specified directory.

The ‘tasklist’ command**\n**will use a WMI query or the “ps” command, which allows Kazuar to obtain running processes from both Windows and Unix systems. Also, Kazuar’s**\n**‘cmd’ command will run commands using “cmd.exe” for Windows systems and “/bin/bash” for Unix systems. These two commands provide evidence**\n**that the authors of Kazuar intended to use this malware as a cross-platform tool to target both Windows and Unix systems.**\n\n**Kazuar contains three commands related to plugins: plugin, plugout and pluglist. These three commands allow an actor to administer a framework that**\n**allows Kazuar to use additional plugins. This plugin framework provides Kazuar potentially endless functionality, as its operators can provide additional**\n**.NET applications that Kazuar can load and execute.**\n\n### Kazuar’s Remote API\n\n**While many backdoor Trojans have extensive command handlers and plugin frameworks, Kazuar’s ‘remote’ command provides a functionality that is**\n**rarely seen in backdoors used in espionage campaigns. This command instructs the Trojan to start a thread to listen for inbound HTTP requests, which**\n**effectively turns Kazuar into a webserver. This functionality provides an API for the Trojan to run commands on the compromised system. Figure 8 shows�**\n**the code within Kazuar that provides this functionality.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8 HTTP method handler used by Kazuar to provide threat actors with API access_**\n\n**To initiate this functionality, the actor will issue the ‘remote’ command and provide a list of URI prefixes that Kazuar’s HTTP listener will process and�**\n**respond to. The URI prefix supplied by the actor would be added to the “Prefixes” property of the HttpListener class, which requires a schema, a host,�**\n**an optional port and optional path. The actor would then issue HTTP requests to URLs that match these URI prefixes using specific methods,�**\n**specifically OPTIONS, POST, GET and PUT methods to interact with the compromised system using Kazuar’s command set seen in Table 3.�**\n\n**This functionality flips the communication flow between the Trojan and the C2 server. Instead of the Trojan initiating communications with its C2 server,�**\n**the C2 server sends requests directly to the Trojan. This communications flow is important if the compromised system is a remotely accessible server�**\n**that may raise flags when initiating outbound requests. Also, by creating this type of API access, the threat actors could use one accessible server as a�**\n**single point to dump data to and exfiltrate data from.�**\n\n**HTTP Method** **Description of Functionality**\n\n**OPTIONS** **No functionality, just responds with an HTTP “OK” status**\n\n**POST** **Actor provides XML formatted data that Kazuar will use to create a new task. Uses the exact same method**\n**(‘readResponse0’ seen in Figure 7) to parse the XML data obtained in the initial C2 communications channel discussed**\n**earlier. Kazuar writes the results of the task to a log file that it references as “res” within a folder referenced as “tsk”.�**\n\n**GET** **Provides the contents of the results of the previous task created via the HTTP POST request that is stored in the “res” file.�**\n\n**PUT** **Actor provides XML formatted data that Kazuar will use to create a new task. This method is similar to the POST method,**\n**however, instead of saving the results of the command to a “res” file it responds to the HTTP PUT request with the results�**\n**of the command.**\n\n**_Table 3 HTTP methods and the functionality they provide in Kazuar’s API_**\n\n**This functionality flips the communication flow between the Trojan and the C2 server. Instead of the Trojan initiating communications with its C2 server,�**\n**the C2 server sends requests directly to the Trojan. This communications flow is important if the compromised system is a remotely accessible server�**\n**that may raise flags when initiating outbound requests. Also, by creating this type of API access, the threat actors could use one accessible server as a�**\n**single point to dump data to and exfiltrate data from.�**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**While yet another fully featured backdoor alone is not particularly novel, the existence of a code path for Unix, combined with the portability of .NET**\n**Framework code makes the Kazuar Trojan an interesting tool to keep an eye on. Another interesting portion of this malware is its remote API that allows**\n**actors to issue commands to the compromised system via inbound HTTP requests. Based on our analysis, we believe that threat actors may compile**\n**Windows and Unix based payloads using the same code to deploy Kazuar against both platforms. Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus subscribers can**\n**explore additional samples using the Kazuar AutoFocus tag.**\n\n### Related Indicators and Identifying Information\n\n|HTTP Method|Description of Functionality|\n|---|---|\n|OPTIONS|No functionality, just responds with an HTTP “OK” status|\n|POST|Actor provides XML formatted data that Kazuar will use to create a new task.

This method is similar to the POST method, however, instead of saving the results of the command to a “res” file it responds to the HTTP PUT request with the results� of the command.|\n\n\n-----\n\n**b51105c56d1bf8f98b7e924aa5caded8322d037745a128781fa0bc23841d1e70**\n\n**bf6f30673cf771d52d589865675a293dc5c3668a956d0c2fc0d9403424d429b2**\n\n**cd4c2e85213c96f79ddda564242efec3b970eded8c59f1f6f4d9a420eb8f1858**\n\n**URLs**\n\n**http://gaismustudija[.]lv/wp-includes/pomo/kontakti.php**\n\n**http://hcdh-tunisie[.]org/wp-includes/SimplePie/gzencode.php**\n\n**http://www.gallen[.]fi/wp-content/gallery/�**\n\n**File Activity**\n\n**%LOCALAPPDATA%\\/[a-f0-9]{32}\\/[a-f0-9]{32}\\.dll**\n\n**%LOCALAPPDATA%\\/[a-f0-9]{32}\\/[a-f0-9]{32}/**\n\n**%USERPROFILE%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\*.lnk**\n\n**RSA Keys**\n\n**<RSAKeyValue>**\n**<Modulus>gSI+OxtBrfXVfSRRSlNIMVYr9HFy40jokIDkUqffhU7Y/VcFB1nc8GwT4GOjK6lR/mJi3XcGg+nxqR9iLoeoOLgBFFz9O1l++81tPtRaVZ8yg+IzmZlaM**\n**</Modulus><Exponent>EQ==</Exponent>**\n**<P>hGjs2pEZW4pN2b0Bm9xl84zxqQ2BMSflj2xpf5MH+XvCY5BBN3YROm24LYtGwy3xOdKeUJOENvYbkvirBcm2ecRxmLgE5AMMeWxZpOayUtOUd+Abx**\n**</P>**\n**<Q>+ap/8gRvidWrAhZcAiCAYdFZIt6hSwBz5ohU5ZSPomv9e/Urtts8cin+QeBvDwF6UvyP1vz3wxUOXycaBI3StCMjCXHuBLN+wfpEhfdt6KKywsmW7I5Odo**\n**</Q>**\n**<DP>D5PfoT4/N/InRsrxIWU5K7Y6jFvxFNeEaznuSz55aKUl7ZiAJKR6f1gzyR9xvJv+Qwm4RbcAfu/HAjtfahe7HWJnt50twHjUSoU3uQwU+q964O0wcdLGCW**\n**</DP>**\n**<DQ>vuvLQJn68O6v8omRp0YH0lTLsUDVsdMrdA3mkXGbA7v+E38/i9TT3tTRfaugOKbG9CqMHN+QSeLs31oi9Gxz8yntnc+X5XozwYMlV2Lbk8e14D/Nw/R**\n**</DQ>**\n**<InverseQ>cfVixwsMog8F8CDikcYKNmUGNJPeJ4grdJi4ZIMX5mSuhdvSccTnx7JoCMJ2LKwFLyMnmZIIeYF4EYBgwHz6rumL8Zam6Zr04uIpxWL3MZyR9B**\n**</InverseQ>**\n**<D>PMTR/bJ5Qs4KHMXL5r3Hnr8jvlOBW+YTFtM+RQO0evftpGUviv0crWAJWok9ujGP/z1bs4NOXDHbImkfJPSLZfw8vknglGZZ3+gzaNxmvuGBLwEJOTkb**\n**</D></RSAKeyValue>**\n\n**<RSAKeyValue>**\n**<Modulus>m4SbvlZhH5UzcgDLIEIygjTCCQMxc/TrwUYZ5JA5SU2jtSBt9aqwljKJ7h4Tv5eP2Efy4Z+2QajDNtOThift4nVTWsl+iOoMKKV6pvQOFj6k2P4kRTBG**\n**</Modulus><Exponent>EQ==</Exponent></RSAKeyValue>**\n\n**Decrypted Log and Error Messages**\n\n**‘{0}’ autorun algorithm is not supported!**\n\n**‘{0}’ request method isn’t supported.**\n\n**Accessed date mismatch in get command!**\n\n**Accessed date mismatch in list command!**\n\n**Action with identifier {0} is not implemented.�**\n\n**Autorun command requeres autorun type to be set!**\n\n**Autorun failed due to {0}**\n\n**Cmd command requires actual commands list!**\n\n**Commiting suicide…**\n\n**Control server address ‘{0}’ is invalid.**\n\n**Copy command requires destination path!**\n\n**Copy command requires source path!**\n\n**Copying file from {0} to {1}…�**\n\n**Created date mismatch in get command!**\n\n**Created date mismatch in list command!**\n\n**Directory listing for {0}**\n\n**Executing command with {0}…**\n\n**Failed to create agent due to {0}**\n\n**Failed to create channel due to {0}**\n\n**Failed to create injector due to {0}**\n\n**Fatal failure due to {0}**\n\n**Getting file query {0}…�**\n\n**Getting system information…**\n\n**Going to sleep for {0}…**\n\n**Got ‘{0}’ command from {1}.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**HTTP listening isn t supported.**\n\n**IPC channel is not ready.**\n\n**Injected into explorer.**\n\n**Injected into {0} [{1}].**\n\n**Injecting into explorer…**\n\n**Injecting into {0} [{1}]…**\n\n**Injection failed due to {0}**\n\n**Installing plugin…**\n\n**Invalid FTP server status ({0}).**\n\n**Invalid last contact time.**\n\n**Invalid or unknown action format ({0})!**\n\n**Invalid sender interval.**\n\n**Kazuar’s {0} started in process {1} [{2}] as user {3}/{4}.**\n\n**Killing processes…**\n\n**List command requires file query string!�**\n\n**Listening**\n\n**Listing plugins…**\n\n**Listing processes…**\n\n**Max interval value is less than min value!**\n\n**Max interval value is more than supported!**\n\n**Min interval value is less than supported!**\n\n**Modified date mismatch in get command!�**\n\n**Modified date mismatch in list command!�**\n\n**Move command requires destination path!**\n\n**Move command requires source path!**\n\n**Moving file from {0} to {1}…�**\n\n**Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT {0}.{1};
