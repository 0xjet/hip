The malware offers many\ncapabilities for device reconnaissance, remote control, and information stealing, including:\n\nData from browsers (e.g. login, passwords, credit cards, cookies, etc.);\nData from Discord and Telegram (e.g. chat logs, tokens, etc.);\nVPN and FTP Credentials;\n\nSince its discovery, attackers have used many different vectors to spread this stealer,\n[including through fake installers and fake](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/i/fake-installers-drop-malware-and-open-doors-for-opportunistic-attackers.html) [game hacking tools. Also, RedLine Stealer was](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-valorant-cheats-on-youtube-infect-you-with-redline-stealer/)\n[found in compromised devices by the DEV-0537 hacking group (a.k.a. lapsus$).](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/lapsus)\n\nIn April 2022, Netskope Threat Labs identified a new RedLine Stealer campaign spread on\nYouTube, using a fake bot to buy Mystery Box NFT from Binance. The video description\nleads the victim to download the fake bot, which is hosted on GitHub.\n\nIn this blog post, we will analyze this campaign, showing how it’s being spread and how the\nfake bot leads to RedLine Stealer.\n\n\n-----\n\n## YouTube Videos\n\nThe malware is spread through YouTube videos that lure victims into downloading a fake bot\nto automatically buy Binance NFT Mystery Boxes. At this point, we found five videos across\nmultiple channels that are part of the same campaign. All the URLs can be found in our\n[GitHub repository.](https://github.com/netskopeoss/NetskopeThreatLabsIOCs/tree/main/RedLine%20Stealer/IOCs)\n\n_Attacker spreading RedLine through YouTube video._\nThe video description provides details and the download link for the fake bot, which is\nsupposed to be presented as a Chrome extension.\n\n\n-----\n\nVideo description with the link to download the fake bot.\nThe video description also contains different tags, probably to increase its visibility, including:\n\n_binance, nft, bot, buy, mysterybox, box, busd, autobuy, cryptobot, binance, bitcoin, crypto_\n_trading bot, cryptocurrency, binance trading bot, binance trade bot, bitcoin trading bot, btc,_\n_bot, binance bot trading, nance grid trading, bnb, binance nft, bot for binance, binance_\n_trading tutorial_\n\n## Stage 01 – Loader\n\nAll the videos we found are pointing to the same GitHub URL, downloading a file named\n“BinanceNFT.bot v.1.3.zip”.\n\nOnce we decompress the ZIP file, we have the packed RedLine sample (“BinanceNFT.bot\n**v.1.3.exe”) and a Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installer (“VC_redist.x86.exe”).**\n\nDecompressed ZIP file downloaded from GitHub.\n\nThe “README.txt” file contains the instructions that should be followed to run the fake NFT\nbot, including installing the Microsoft Visual C++. This is probably needed as RedLine is\ndeveloped in .NET and it is also unpacked and injected into an executable from this\nframework.\n\n\n-----\n\nReadme file.\n\nThe first stage was likely compiled on April 5, 2022, and it’s responsible for decrypting and\nloading RedLine Stealer into another process.\n\nDetails of the packed RedLine Stealer sample.\nThe binary details also include values that seem to be copied from another executable, using\n“LauncherPatcher.exe” as the original filename.\n\nFurther details about the\n\nfirst stage\n\n\n-----\n\n[Many malware families use a trick to delay the execution of its functions, often to delay the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/003/)\nexecution inside sandboxes, which usually contain limited time of operation. As a result,\n[there are sandboxes that are able to bypass this technique, by patching or hooking Sleep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleep)\nfunctions, for example.\n\nThis RedLine Stealer loader contains a simple trick to evade sandboxes with such\nfunctionality. Upon execution, it tries to delay the execution by 15 seconds and compares the\n[timestamp (GetTickCount) before and after the Sleep API execution. If the elapsed time is](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-gettickcount)\nless than 15 seconds, it exits the process.\n\nTrick to evade\n\nsandbox analysis.\nThis can be tested by patching the Sleep function in a debugger.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedLine loader exiting the process if the Sleep function is bypassed.\nIf the sandbox is not detected through this simple trick, it then decrypts the next stage using\na simple rolling XOR algorithm with “OdoAAtK” as the key.\n\n\n-----\n\nLoader decrypting RedLine Stealer payload.\nThen, it executes a shellcode, which is decrypted using the same algorithm.\n\nLoader decrypting and executing a shellcode.\nAnd finally, the payload is injected to “RegSvcs.exe” using a simple process injection\n[technique, similar to RunPE. We also found cases where a similar loader injects RedLine](https://github.com/Zer0Mem0ry/RunPE/blob/master/RunPE.cpp)\nStealer into “AppLaunch.exe”, as we will describe later.\n\n\n-----\n\nLoader injecting unpacked RedLine Stealer into another process.\n\n## Stage 02 – Payload\n\nRedLine Stealer is developed in .NET, and the compilation timestamp was altered in the\n[binary, showing a date from the year 2102. Formbook was also using altered timestamp](https://www.netskope.com/blog/new-formbook-campaign-delivered-through-phishing-emails)\ndates in its payloads, which is a common behavior for malware authors to deceive\nanalysts/researchers.\n\nFortunately, RedLine Stealer uses a very nonsense date, which can be used for detection in\nYara rules, for example.\n\nRedLine Stealer payload details.\nOnce executed, the infostealer calls a function named “Check”. If this function returns true,\nthe malware exits its process.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedLine Stealer\n\n“Check” function.\nIn summary, this function verifies if the malware is running in blocklisted countries, by\ncomparing the country name with the OS region information.\n\nThis malware does not execute if any of these countries is detected:\n\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nBelarus\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyzstan\nMoldova\nRussia\nTajikistan\nUkraine\nUzbekistan\n\nWe tested this by changing the OS language to Ukrainian. The malware uses the field\n[“EnglishName” from the .NET RegionInfo Class to compare with the blocklist.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.regioninfo?view=net-6.0)\n\n\n-----\n\nRedLine Stealer\n\nexits the process if a blocklisted country is found.\nRedLine Stealer maintains a simple configuration, where the values are base64 encoded\nand encrypted with a rolling XOR algorithm.\n\nRedLine Stealer configuration.\nThe decryption key used by this sample is “Wombles”, and we can use a simple Python\nscript to retrieve the C2 address value:\n\nDecrypting\n\nRedLine Stealer C2 address.\nThe “ID” value also uses the same algorithm:\n\n\n-----\n\nDecrypting RedLine Stealer ID.\n\nAs previously mentioned, RedLine Stealer offers many capabilities to the attacker, including\n[stealing Discord tokens.](https://www.netskope.com/blog/here-comes-troublegrabber-stealing-credentials-through-discord)\n\nRedLine Stealer function that reads Discord tokens.\n\n## More Files From the Same Campaign\n\nLooking at the GitHub account (“NFTSupp”) that owns the repository where the file linked on\nthe YouTube videos is hosted, we can see that the activities started in March, 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nGitHub account and repository hosting RedLine Stealer.\nAside from the files we analyzed in this blog post contained within “BinanceNFT.bot\nv.1.3.zip”, there are 15 additional compressed files hosted in the same repository\n(“NFTBOT”), where two of them are password protected (“45.rar” and\n“Upload.Openbot.rar”).\n\n\n-----\n\nCompressed files within the same repository.\nWithin these compressed files, we found five **distinct RedLine Stealer loaders.**\n\nDifferent RedLine Stealer loaders in the\n\nsame repository.\nAll five loaderswe analyzed are slightly different, but they all unpack and inject RedLine\nStealer in a similar way, as we described earlier in this analysis. The oldest sample we found\nwas likely compiled on March 11, 2022 and the newest one on April 7, 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, two out of five files are digitally signed, which may bypass some antivirus\n[engines. The first one seems to be using a signature from “NordVPN S.A.”](https://nordvpn.com/)\n\nRedLine Stealer digitally signed.\n[And the second is signed for “EasyAntiCheat Oy”.](https://www.easy.ac/en-us/support/h2o/account/eula/)\n\nRedLine Stealer digitally signed.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso, one of the loaders is injecting the payload into **AppLaunch.exe instead of**\n“RegSvcs.exe”.\n\nRedLine Stealer being injected into AppLaunch process.\nWe found four distinct RedLine Stealer payloads from these five loaders, which are all\nsharing the same C2 address.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nAlthough RedLine Stealer is a low-cost malware, it offers many capabilities that could cause\nserious damage to its victims, such as the loss of sensitive data. RedLine Stealer was\nalready known for abusing YouTube videos to spread through fake themes, however, we saw\nin this campaign that the attacker is also abusing GitHub in the attack flow, to host the\npayloads.\n\n## Protection\n\nNetskope Threat Labs is actively monitoring this campaign and has ensured coverage for all\nknown threat indicators and payloads.\n\n**Netskope Threat Protection**\n\nWin32.Trojan.RedLineStealer\n**Netskope Advanced Threat Protection provides proactive coverage against this**\nthreat.\n\nGen.Malware.Detect.By.StHeur indicates a sample that was detected using static\nanalysis\nGen.Malware.Detect.By.Sandbox indicates a sample that was detected by our\ncloud sandbox\n\n## IOCs\n\nAll the IOCs related to this campaign and the Yara rules can be found in our GitHub\nrepository.\n\n\n-----",
