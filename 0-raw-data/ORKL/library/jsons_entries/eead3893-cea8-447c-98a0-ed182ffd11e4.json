In June 2022, Mandiant Managed Defense detected and responded to an UNC2970 phishing](https://advantage.mandiant.com/actors/threat-actor--90d4205f-c1a0-54ab-9d43-e2a507c82de9)\ncampaign targeting a U.S.-based technology company. During this operation, Mandiant observed UNC2970 leverage three new code families:\nTOUCHMOVE, SIDESHOW, and TOUCHSHIFT. Mandiant suspects UNC2970 specifically targeted security researchers in this operation.\nFollowing the identification of this campaign, Mandiant responded to multiple UNC2970 intrusions targeting U.S. and European Media\norganizations through spear-phishing that used a job recruitment theme and demonstrated advancements in the groups ability to operate in\ncloud environments and against Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools.\n\n[UNC2970 is suspected with high confidence to be UNC577, also known as Temp.Hermit. UNC577 is a cluster of North Korean cyber activity](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/mapping-dprk-groups-to-government)\nthat has been active since at least 2013. The group has significant malware overlaps with other North Korean operators and is believed to\nshare resources, such as code and complete malware tools with other distinct actors. While observed UNC577 activity primarily targets entities\nin South Korea, it has also targeted other organizations worldwide.\n\nUNC2970 has historically targeted organizations with spear phishing emails containing a job recruitment theme. These operations have\n[multiple overlaps with public reporting on “Operation Dream Job” by Google TAG,](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/) [Proofpoint, and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/above-fold-and-your-inbox-tracing-state-aligned-activity-targeting-journalists) [ClearSky.](https://www.clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/)\n\nUNC2970 has recently shifted to targeting users directly on LinkedIn using fake accounts posing as recruiters. UNC2970 maintains an array of\nspecially crafted LinkedIn accounts based on legitimate users. These accounts are well designed and professionally curated to mimic the\nidentities of the legitimate users in order to build rapport and increase the likelihood of conversation and interaction. UNC2970 uses these\naccounts to socially engineer targets into engaging over WhatsApp, where UNC2970 will then deliver a phishing payload either to a target’s\n[email, or directly over WhatsApp. UNC2970 largely employs the PLANKWALK backdoor during phishing operations as well as other malware](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--ec04315b-0ba3-552b-a008-fa519265cf1b)\n[families that share code with multiple tools leveraged by UNC577. Mandiant recently published a blog post detailing UNC2970 activity that was](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/dprk-whatsapp-phishing)\nidentified by Mandiant Managed Defense during proactive threat hunting. This activity was initially clustered as UNC4034 but has since been\nmerged into UNC2970 based on multiple infrastructure, tooling, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) overlaps.\n\n[When you're done reading this post, don't forget to check out part two on LIGHTSHIFT and LIGHTSHOW.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/lightshift-and-lightshow)\n\n## Summary\n\nIn June 2022, Mandiant Managed Defense detected and responded to an UNC2970 phishing campaign targeting a U.S.-based technology\n[company. During this operation, Mandiant observed UNC2970 leverage three new code families: TOUCHMOVE,](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--4df9ff57-29d1-5094-a27c-841a416b07d6) [SIDESHOW, and](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--b209ce9f-5e33-5c51-a8f5-6307ced37da4)\n[TOUCHSHIFT. Mandiant suspects UNC2970 specifically targeted security researchers in this operation. Following the identification of this](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--aa058a44-5f15-59a4-94eb-4891bc817794)\ncampaign, Mandiant responded to multiple UNC2970 intrusions targeting U.S. and European Media organizations through spear-phishing that\nused a job recruitment theme.\n\n### Initial Access\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen conducting phishing operations, UNC2970 engaged with targets initially over LinkedIn masquerading as recruiters. Once UNC2970\ncontacts a target, they would attempt to shift the conversation to WhatsApp, where they would continue interacting with their target before\nsending a phishing payload that masqueraded as a job description. In at least one case, UNC2970 continued interacting with a victim even\nafter the phishing payload was executed and detected, asking for screenshots of the detection.\n\nThe phishing payloads primarily utilized by UNC2970 are Microsoft Word documents embedded with macros to perform remote-template\ninjection to pull down and execute a payload from a remote command and control (C2). Mandiant has observed UNC2970 tailoring the fake job\ndescriptions to specific targets.\n\nFigure 1: UNC2970 lure document\nThe C2 servers utilized by UNC2970 for remote template injection have primarily been compromised WordPress sites, a trend observed in\nother UNC2970 code families as well as those used by other DPRK groups. At the time of analysis, the remote template was no longer present\non the C2, however following this phishing activity, Mandiant identified it beaconing to a C2 associated with PLANKWALK.\n\nIn the most recent UNC2970 investigation, Mandiant observed the group returning to WhatsApp to engage their targets. This activity overlaps\nwith a [recent blog post by MSTIC on operations from ZINC, as well as the previously mentioned Mandiant blog post from July 2022.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/29/zinc-weaponizing-open-source-software/)\n\nThe ZIP file delivered by UNC2970 contained what the victim thought was a skills assessment test for a job application. In reality, the ZIP\n[contained an ISO file, which included a trojanized version of TightVNC that Mandiant tracks as LIDSHIFT. The victim was instructed to run the](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--7ab8deac-e1ae-502f-a12f-2bab9a7d398e)\nTightVNC application which, along with the other files, are named appropriately to the company the victim had planned to take the assessment\nfor.\n\nIn addition to functioning as a legitimate TightVNC viewer, LIDSHIFT contained multiple hidden features. The first was that upon execution by\nthe user, the malware would send a beacon back to its hardcoded C2; the only interaction this needed from the user was the launching of the\nprogram. This lack of interaction differs from what MSTIC observed in their recent blog post. The initial C2 beacon from LIDSHIFT contains the\nvictim’s initial username and hostname.\n\nLIDSHIFT’s second capability is to reflectively inject an encrypted DLL into memory. The injected DLL is a trojanized Notepad++ plugin that\n[functions as a downloader, which Mandiant tracks as LIDSHOT. LIDSHOT is injected as soon as the victim opens the drop down inside of the](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--a9181d67-5769-5c15-91f1-16ea10c6788c)\nTightVNC Viewer application LIDSHOT has two primary functions: system enumeration and downloading and executing shellcode from the\n\n\n-----\n\nC\n\nLIDSHOT sends the following information back to its C2:\n```\n   Computer Name\n   Product name as recorded in the following registry key SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\ProductName\n   IP address\n   Process List with User and Session ID associate per process\n\n### Establish Foothold\n\n```\nIn multiple investigations, Mandiant has observed UNC2970 deploy PLANKWALK to establish footholds within environments. PLANKWALK is\na backdoor written in C++ that communicates over HTTP and utilizes multiple layers of DLL sideloading to execute an encrypted payload.\nPLANKWALK is initially executed through a launcher that will import and execute a second stage launcher expected to be on disk.\n\nObserved First Stage Launcher names:\n```\n   destextapi.dll\n   manextapi.dll\n   pathextapi.dll\n   preextapi.dll\n   Wbemcomn.dll\n\n```\nOnce loaded and executed, the secondary launcher will attempt to decrypt and execute an encrypted PLANKWALK sample on disk that\nmatches the following pattern:\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Vault\\cache<three numerical digits>.db\n\n```\nOnce executed, PLANKWALK will decrypt an on-host encrypted configuration file that contains the C2 for the backdoor. The C2 for\nPLANKWALK has largely been co-opted by legitimate WordPress sites.\n\nFollowing the deployment of PLANKWALK, Mandiant observed UNC2970 leverage a wide variety of additional tooling, including Microsoft\nInTune to deploy a shellcode downloader.\n\n## Tool Time: Kim “The Toolman” Taylor\n\nDuring their operations, Mandiant has observed UNC2970 use a wide range of custom, post-exploitation tooling to achieve their goals. One of\nUNC2970's go-to tools has been a dropper tracked as TOUCHSHIFT. TOUCHSHIFT allows UNC2970 to employ follow-on tooling that range\nfrom keyloggers and screenshot utilities, to full featured backdoors.\n\n### TOUCHSHIFT\n\nTOUCHSHIFT is a malicious dropper that masquerades as mscoree.dllor netplwix.dll. TOUCHSHIFT is typically created in the same\ndirectory and simultaneously as a legitimate copy of a Windows binary. TOUCHSHIFT leverages DLL Search Order Hijacking to use the\nlegitimate file to load and execute itself. TOUCHSHIFT has been observed containing one to two various payloads which it executes inmemory. Payloads that have been seen include TOUCHSHOT, TOUCHKEY, HOOKSHOT, TOUCHMOVE, and SIDESHOW.\n\nTo appear legitimate, the file uses over 100 exports that match common system export names. However, the majority all point to the same\nempty function. The malicious code has been seen located in exports LockClrVersion or UsersRunDllW in different instances.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Malicious export alongside several of the dummy exports\nWhen TOUCHSHIFT contains a second payload, it takes a single character command line option as its first argument to determine which of\nthe two payloads to execute.\n\nFigure 3: Checking command line options\n\nTo unpack its payload(s), TOUCHSHIFT generates a decryption key by XOR encoding its second argument and the first 16 characters of the\nlegitimate executable’s file name.\n\nFor example, in one instance Mandiant observed the arguments -CortanaUIFilter, XOR encoded with the hardcoded key\n```\n009WAYHb90687PXkS,and printfilterpipel,which was XOR encoded with the hardcoded key .sV%58&.lypQ[$= and was loaded by the file\nprintfilterpipelinesvc.exe. In another instance, the argument used was --forkavlauncher and the loading file was\nC:\\windows\\Branding\\Netplwiz.exe.\n\n```\nOnce the code is unpacked, it is then loaded into a memory location created by a call to VirtualAlloc and executed from there.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Beginning of unpacked payload in memory\nOnce the payload(s) has/have been executed, the main portion of TOUCHSHIFT will sleep for a period of time allowing the payload(s) to\ncontinue executing.\n\n## TOUCHSHIFT-ing into Gear — Follow on payloads\n\n### TOUCHSHOT\n\n[TOUCHSHOT takes screenshots of the system on which it is running and saves them to a file to be retrieved by the threat actor at a later time.](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--be93805b-2f6f-5192-95c5-2ddaf8069086)\nTOUCHSHOT is configured to take a screenshot every three seconds, and then uses ZLIB to compress the images. The compressed data is\nthen appended to a file that it creates and continues appending new screenshots to this file until the file reaches five megabytes in size, at\nwhich point it will create a new file with the same naming convention. TOUCHSHOT was seen embedded in the same instance of\nTOUCHSHIFT as TOUCHKEY (discussed later in the post).\n\nTOUCHSHOT will create a file in the C:\\Users\\{user}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Themes\\ directory, and will name the file\n```\n~DM{####}P.dat, where the four numbers are pseudo-randomly generated. Once TOUCHSHOT has generated the file name, it attempts to\n\n```\ncreate a handle to the file. If the return value indicates that the file does not exist, it will then create the file. This check is performed as part of a\nloop that continues until a new file needs to be created. After each iteration of the loop, TOUCHSHOT will then take a screenshot, which is\nappended to the staging file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Generation of the directory path\n\nFigure 6: Generation of file name with pseudo-random numbers\n\nFigure 7: Creating a handle to the file or creating it\n\nFigure 8: Taking a screenshot\n\n### TOUCHKEY\n\n[TOUCHKEY is a keylogger that captures keystrokes and clipboard data, both of which are encoded with a single-byte XOR and saved to a file.](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--de7f76ac-05bf-52e7-9da0-46a99589ef21)\nAs with TOUCHSHOT, these files need to be acquired by the threat actor through additional means.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: XOR’ing data with byte 0x62 before writing to the staging file\n\nTOUCHKEY creates two files in the C:\\Users\\{user}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Templates\\directory. The file name\n```\nNormal.dostis used for storing the captured keystrokes, while the file name Normal.docbis used for the clipboard data. The full paths are then\n\n```\npassed into their own thread, where the keystrokes or clipboard data will be captured and appended to their respective files.\n\nFigure 10: Path generation for the staging files\n\nFigure 11: Adding file names to the full path and creating the threads\n\nIn one of the created threads, TOUCHKEY will open the clipboard and grab the data that is stored within it. In the other thread, TOUCHKEY\nwill set a hook into the keyboard, and record any keys that are pressed.\n\nFigure 12: Capturing the clipboard data\n\nFigure 13: Capturing keystrokes\n\n### HOOKSHOT\n\n[HOOKSHOT is a tunneler that leverages a statically linked implementation of OpenSSL to communicate back to its C2. While it connects over](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--b32a4eed-a125-5535-aba5-54ad762f0e4e)\nTCP, it does not make use of a client certificate for encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Example of OpenSSL statically linked in the file\n\nHOOKSHOT takes an encoded argument containing two IP and port pairs, which it will leverage for communicating with its C2.\n\nFigure 15: Separating IP’s and ports\n\nHOOKSHOT will then create a socket using these two IP addresses, and tunnel traffic across them utilizing TLSv1.0.\n\nFigure 16: Socket creation\n\n### TOUCHMOVE\n\nTOUCHMOVE is a loader that decrypts a configuration file and a payload, both of which must be on disk, and then executes the payload.\nTOUCHMOVE generates an RC6 key to decrypt the two files by querying the system’s BIOS date, version, manufacturer, and product name.\nOnce decrypted, the results are XOR encoded with a hardcoded key. If the generated RC6 key is incorrect, the configuration and payload files\nwill not successfully decrypt, indicating that UNC2970 compiles instances of TOUCHMOVE after having already conducted reconnaissance on\nthe target victim system. Once the RC6 key is successfully generated, a handle is created to the configuration file, and the decryption process\nis conducted. If the configuration file is successfully decrypted, the payload’s full path is located within it, and the same decryption process then\noccurs on the payload. Following this, the payload is executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: Bios query strings\n\nFigure 18: Creating a handle to the configuration file\n\nFigure 19: Creating a handle to the payload\n\n### SIDESHOW\n\nSIDESHOW is a backdoor written in C/C++ that communicates via HTTP POST requests with its C2 server. The backdoor is multi-threaded,\nuses RC6 encryption, and supports at least 49 commands, which can be seen in Table 1. Capabilities include arbitrary command execution\n(WMI capable); payload execution via process injection; service, registry, scheduled task, and firewall manipulation; querying and updating\nDomain Controller settings; creating password protected ZIP files; and more. SIDESHOW does not explicitly establish persistence; however,\nbased on the multitude of supported commands it may be commanded to establish persistence.\n\nSIDESHOW derives a system-specific RC6 key using the same registry values as TOUCHMOVE and uses the generated key to decrypt the\nsame configuration file from disk that TOUCHMOVE decrypted. The decrypted configuration file contains a list of C2 URLs to which\nSIDESHOW communicates using HTTP POST requests. SIDESHOW iterates this C2 URL list and attempts to authenticate to each C2 URL\nuntil it is successful. Once successful, SIDESHOW enters a state of command processing and sends additional HTTP POST requests to\nretrieve commands. SIDESHOW attempts to use the system's default HTTP User-Agent string during C2 communications; however, if not\navailable it uses the hard-coded HTTP User-Agent string:\n```\n Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36\n Edg/97.0.1072.69\n\n```\nWhen communicating to its C2 server via HTTP POST requests, SIDESHOW forms a URI parameter string consisting of a mix of randomly\nselected and hard-coded URI parameters.\n\nAuthentication requests use the following URI parameter string format:\n```\n 1<param_1>=<hex_seed>&<param_2>=pAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2C&<param_3>=<16_random_hex_chars>\n\n```\nThe first URI parameter value comes from SIDESHOW’s configuration and is used to seed the random function.\n\nThe second URI parameter value, pAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2C, is hardcoded and likely an authentication credential.\n\nThe third URI parameter value, <16_random_hex_chars>, is a session identifier (<session_id>) used for future communications and consists\nof two subcomponents:\n\n1. <8_random_hex_based_on_seed>\n2. <8_random_hex_based_on_tickcount>\n\nThe first URI parameter's value, <hex_seed>, is used as a random seed value to derive the first eight hexadecimal characters\n(<8_random_hex_based_on_seed>), whereas the last eight hexadecimal characters (<8_random_hex_based_on_tickcount>) are derived using\nthe CPU's current tick count as the random seed value. This results in the value <8_random_hex_based_on_seed> being deterministic, while\n```\n<8_random_hex_based_on_tickcount> is pseudo-random.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\ne o o g s a e a p e aut e t cat o U pa a ete st g\n```\n 1pguid=A59&ssln=pAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2C&cup2key=184B280E341AE63F\n\n```\nFigure 20: Building of URI parameter string\n\nSIDESHOW parses the response and considers it a successful authentication if it contains the string <!DOCTYPE html>.\n\nCommand requests use the following URI parameter string format (notice that the <param_2> and <param_3> have switched locations in the\nstring).\n```\n 1<param_1>=<5_random_digits>&<param_3>=2<session_id>&<param_2>=<6_random_digits>\n\n```\nExample command URI parameter string:\n```\n 1other=37685&session=2184B280E341AE63F&page=593881\n\n```\nSIDESHOW parses the command response body and extracts data following the string <!DOCTYPE html>. SIDESHOW then appears to\nBase64 decode and RC6 decrypt the extracted data. SIDESHOW responds to the commands listed in Table 1 (commands are described on a\nbest effort basis).\n\nFigure 21: Switch statement following parsing of commandTable 1: Commands\n\nsupported by SIDESHOW\n\n**Command ID** **Description**\n\n`00` Get lightweight system information and a few configuration details\n\n`01` Enumerate drives and list free space\n\n`02` List files in directory\n\n`03` Execute arbitrary command via CreateProccess() and return output\n\n`04` Likely zip directory to create password protected ZIP file with password AtbsxjCiD2axc*ic[3</8Ad81!G./1kiThAfkgnw\n\n`05` Download file to system\n\n`06` Execute process\n\n`07` Execute process and spoof parent process identifier (PID)\n\n`08` Execute PE payload via process injection for specified PID\n\n`09` Execute PE payload via loading into malware's memory space\n\n\n-----\n\n`0A` List running processes and loaded DLLs\n\n`0B` Terminate process\n\n`0C` Securely delete a file by first writing random data and then calling DeleteFile()\n\n`0D` Connect to specified IP address and port -- use unknown\n\n`0E` Not implemented\n\n`0F` Set current directory\n\n`10` Timestomp a file using another file's timestamp\n\n`11` Update beacon interval\n\n`12` Update beacon interval and save configuration to disk\n\n`13` Clean up by securely deleting supporting files, registry values, services, and exit\n\n`14` Load configuration from disk\n\n`15` Update configuration and save to disk\n\n`16` Get size of all files in a directory\n\n`17` Get specified drive's free disk space\n\n`18` Suspend a process\n\n`19` Suspend a process\n\n`1A` Load DLL in another process\n\n`1B` Unload DLL in another process\n\n`1C` Copy file to another location\n\n`1D` Remove directory\n\n`1E` Move file to another location\n\n`1F` Execute shellcode payload via process injection for specified PID\n\n`20` Execute shellcode payload via loading into malware's memory space\n\n`21` Get networking configuration information\n\n`22` Query or modify settings on a Windows Domain Controller\n\n`23` Query or modify system's firewall settings\n\n`24` List active TCP and UDP connections\n\n\n-----\n\n`25` Ping a remote system via ICMP requests -- usage unknown\n\n`26` Query or modify system's registry\n\n`27` Query or modify system's services\n\n`28` Ping a remote system via ICMP requests -- usage unknown\n\n`29` Get domain and user account name for which the malware's process is running under\n\n`2A` Execute WMI command\n\n`2B` Resolve domain name via DNS query\n\n`2C` Query or modify system's scheduled tasks\n\n`2D` Get heavyweight system information\n\n`2E` Get networking interface information\n\n`2F` Create directory\n\n`30` List files in directory\n\n## Reaching for the Clouds: Intune with CLOUDBURST\n\nIn at least one investigation, Mandiant identified the threat actors leveraging Microsoft Intune, Microsoft's endpoint management solution, to\ndeploy malware to hosts in the environment. Mandiant suspects that this method of malware deployment was used due to the absence of a\n[VPN solution for remote machines. In order to remotely execute code, the attackers leveraged the Microsoft Intune management extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/intune-management-extension)\n(IME) to upload custom PowerShell scripts containing malicious code to various hosts in the client environment. While conducting forensic\nanalysis on a host, Mandiant identified the following Microsoft IME related PowerShell script command line arguments:\n```\n \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -NoProfile -executionPolicy bypass -file \"C:\\Program Files\n (x86)\\Microsoft Microsoft IME\\Policies\\Scripts\\42fb3cca-48dd-4412-a11a-245384544402_f391eded-82d3-4506-8bf4 9213f6f4d586.ps1\n\n```\nAt the time of analysis, Mandiant was unable to acquire the PS1 file itself, however; Mandiant was able to acquire a full copy of the PS1 file\nfrom local Microsoft IME logs identified on a host, located at:\n```\n C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\IntuneManagementExtension\\Logs\\IntuneManagementExtension-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log\n\n```\nThe entry in the local logs appeared as follows:\n```\n <![LOG[[PowerShell] response payload is [{\"AccountId\":\"[userGUID]\",\"PolicyId\":\"f391eded-82d3-4506-8bf4 9213f6f4d586\",\"PolicyType\":1,\"DocumentSchemaVersion\":\"1.0\",\"PolicyHash\":\"P23cVfMyHLECSGPt1T6YYcoxhCLWKS05jX5M\n ukC3MIw=\",\"PolicyBody\":\"$EnModule = \\\"[Base64_encoded_CLOUDBURST_payload]\"\\r\\n$DeModule =\n [System.Convert]::FromBase64CharArray($EnModule, 0, $EnModule.Length)\\r\\nSet-Content\n \\\"C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\mscoree.dll\\\" -Value $DeModule -Encoding Byte\\r\\nCopy-Item\n \\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\PresentationHost.exe\\\" -Destination \\\"C:\\\\ProgramData\\\"\\r\\nStart-Process  NoNewWindow -FilePath \\\"C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\PresentationHost.exe\\\" -ArgumentList \\\" embeddingObject\\\"\\r\\n\",\"PolicyBodySize\":null,\"PolicyScriptParameters\":null,\"ContentSignature\":\"\n [Base64_encoded_signing_certificate]\",\"isTombStoned\":false,\"isRecurring\":false,\"isFullSync\":false,\"ExecutionContext\":0,\n \"InternalVersion\":1,\"EnforceSignatureCheck\":false,\"RunningMode\":1,\"RemediationScript\":null,\"RunRemediation\":false,\"\n RemediateScriptHash\":null,\"RemediationScriptParameters\":null,\"ComplianceRules\":null,\"ExecutionFrequency\":0,\"\n RetryCount\":0,\"BlockExecutionNotifications\":false,\"ModifiedTime\":null,\"Schedule\":null,\"IsFirstPartyScript\":false,\"TargetTy\n \"ScriptApplicabilityStateDueToAssignmentFilters\":null,\"AssignmentFilterIdToEvalStateMap\":\n {},\"HardwareConfigurationMetadata\":null}]]LOG]!><time=\"06:59:15.2941778\" date=\"6-9-2022\" component=\"IntuneManagementExtens\n context=\"\" type=\"1\" thread=\"5\" file=\"\">\n\n```\n\n-----\n\ne a c ous o e S e sc pt as used to decode t e ase6 e coded C OU U S pay oad a d d op t o d s as\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\mscoree.dll. The script would then write a copy of C:\\Windows\\System32\\PresentationHost.exe to C:\\ProgramData and\n\n```\nexecute it with the argument -embeddingObject. PresentationHost.exe is a legitimate Windows binary used by UNC2970 to sideload\nCLOUDBURST.\n\nUpon execution, PresentationHost.exe would load the CLOUDBURST payload into memory. Upon further analysis of the Microsoft IME\nendpoint logs, Mandiant identified a unique GUID, f391eded-82d3-4506-8bf4-9213f6f4d586, in the PolicyID field, which is a \"Unique identifier\nof the Policy in the data warehouse\". The Intune Data Warehouse provides insight and information about an enterprise mobile environment,\nsuch as historical Intune data and Intune data refreshed on a daily occurence. The identified GUID also matched the GUID of the PowerShell\nscript file name and the GUID observed in an IME associated registry key.\n\n[When reviewing the Intune Tenant admin Audit logs, Mandiant identified the same GUID under the ObjectID field. The Intune Tenant audit logs](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/TenantAdminMenu/auditing)\nshows records of activities that generate a change in Intune, including create, update (edit), delete, assign, and remote actions. The logs\nrevealed that the threat actors used a previously compromised account to perform a create, assign, patch, and finally a delete action of a\nDevice Management Script, using the Target Microsoft.Management.Services.Api.DeviceManagementScript and the GroupID f391eded```\n82d3-4506-8bf4-9213f6f4d586.\n\n```\nFurther analysis revealed that ObjectID GUIDs referenced in the Intune Tenant admin Audit logs maps to the ID of Mobile App assignment\ngroups.\n\nAt the time of analysis, the GroupID f391eded-82d3-4506-8bf4-9213f6f4d586, was no longer present in the Intune Endpoint management\nadmin center, and was likely deleted by the threat actors.\n\nIn order to determine malicious usage of Microsoft Intune, Mandiant performed the following analysis steps:\n\n1. Analyzed AzureAD sign-in logs for evidence of suspicious logons to the Microsoft Intune application\n\nAnalyzed Microsoft Intune audit logs for evidence of unexpected deployments and performed the following:\n\nUtilized the GroupID GUID to search for the presence of the following endpoint artifacts:\n\n1. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\IntuneManagementExtension\\Policies\\<UserGUID>\\<suspicious ObjectID\n\n_GUID>_\n2. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Microsoft IME\\Policies\\Scripts\\<UserGUID>_<suspicious ObjectID GUID>.ps1\n2. For hosts that had the aforementioned artifacts, the following was performed:\n\nAcquired the PS1 file(s) and analyzed for malicious code\nPerformed traditional endpoint analysis\n\nMandiant tracks the malware being distributed via InTune as CLOUDBURST. CLOUDBURST is a downloader written in C that communicates\nvia HTTP. The malware attempts to make itself look like a legitimate version of mscoree.dll, but contains fake exports, the same way that\nTOUCHSHIFT uses fake exports. One variant of CLOUDBURST made use of legitimate open-source software that was added as exports, in\naddition to the fake exports. The actual export with malicious code is CorExitProcess. The CorExitProcessexport expects the single\nargument -embeddingObject.\n\nFigure 22: Comparing command line argument with -embeddingObject\n\nOnce the aforementioned command line argument has been verified, CLOUDBURST builds the domain as a stack string, and sends out the\ntwo following requests to the C2 server:\n```\n hxxps://[c2domain]/wp-content/plugins/contact.php?gametype=<random_dword>&type=O8Akm8aV09Nw412KMoWJd\n hxxps://[c2domain]/wp-content/plugins/contact.php?gametype=tennis&type=k<random_dword>\n\n```\nFollowing the network connections, CLOUDBURST conducts a host survey, in which it will determine the Product Name, Computer Name, and\nenumerate running processes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 23: Calling functions to enumerate the host\n\nUpon completion of the host enumeration, CLOUDBURST then downloads and executes shellcode from the C2 server. At this time, Mandiant\nwas unable to recover and identify the purpose of the shellcode downloaded by CLOUDBURST.\n\nFigure 24: Allocating and populating memory space, and\n\nexecuting the shellcode\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nThe identified malware tools highlight continued malware development and deployment of new tools by UNC2970. Although the group has\npreviously targeted defense, media, and technology industries, the targeting of security researchers suggests a shift in strategy or an\nexpansion of its operations. Technical indicators and the group’s TTPs link it to TEMP.Hermit, although this latest activity suggests the group is\n[adapting their capabilities as more of their targets move to cloud services. To learn more about how UNC2970 further enabled its operations,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/lightshift-and-lightshow)\nplease see part two of our research.\n\n## Campaign Tracking\n\nMandiant will continue to monitor UNC2970’s [campaigns and intrusion operations and will provide notable and dynamic updates regarding](https://advantage.mandiant.com/campaigns/campaign--a88d0ca3-6887-5024-ac17-b1682250710c)\nchanges in tactics and techniques, the introduction of tools with new capabilities, or the use of new infrastructure to carry out their mission.\n\n[For more insights into how Mandiant tracks this and similar campaigns, see our Threat Campaigns feature within](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/attacker-visibility-threat-campaigns) Mandiant Advantage Threat\nIntelligence.\n\n## Recommended Mitigations\n\n### Hardening Azure AD and Microsoft Intune\n\nMandiant has observed UNC2970 leverage weak identity controls in Azure AD combined with Microsoft Intune’s endpoint management\ncapabilities to effectively deploy malicious PowerShell scripts onto unsuspecting endpoints.\n\nIncreasing Azure AD identity protections and limiting access to Microsoft Intune is essential in mitigating the attacker activity observed by\nMandiant. Organizations should consider implementing the following hardening controls:\n\n**Cloud-Only Accounts: Organizations should utilize cloud-only accounts for privileged access within Azure AD (e.g., Global Admins, Intune**\nAdministrator) and never assign privileged access to synced accounts from on-premises identity providers such as Active Directory.\nAdditionally, admins should utilize a separate “daily-driver” account for day-to-day activities such as sending email or web-browsing. Dedicated\nadmin accounts should be utilized to carry out administrative functions only.\n\n**Enforce Strong Multi-Factor Authentication Methods: Organizations should consider enforcing enhanced and phishing-resistant Multi-**\nFactor Authentication (MFA) methods for all users and administrators. Weak MFA methods commonly include SMS, Voice (phone call), OTPs,\nor Push notifications and should be considered for removal. MFA enhancements for non-privileged users should include contextual information\nregarding the MFA request such as number-matching, application name, and geographic location. For privileged accounts, Mandiant\nrecommends the enforcement of hardware tokens or FIDO2 Security Keys as-well as requiring MFA per each sign-in regardless of location\n(e.g., Trusted Network, Corporate VPN). As an initial roll out for enhanced MFA methods, organizations should focus on all accounts with\nadministrative privileges in Azure AD. Microsoft has [additional information regarding contextual MFA settings.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-additional-context)\n\n**Privileged Identity Management (PIM) Solution: Mandiant recommends that organizations consider utilizing a PIM solution. A PIM solution**\nshould include a Just-In-Time (JIT) access capability which will provide access when requested, for a specific duration of time, and should\ninitiate an approval flow, prior to providing an account access to a highly privileged role (e.g., Global Administrator or Intune Administrator).\n\n**Conditional Access Policies (CAPs) to Enforce Security Restrictions in Azure AD: A CAP allows organizations to set requirements for**\naccessing cloud apps such as Intune, based on various conditions including location and device platform. Mandiant recommends that\nOrganizations utilize CAPs to restrict Azure administrative functions to only compliant and registered devices in Azure AD and only from a\nspecific subset of trusted IPs or ranges. Microsoft has [more information on leveraging CAPs to access Cloud Apps.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps)\n\n\n-----\n\n**u e de t ty** **otect o** u e de t ty otect o s a secu ty eatu e t u e ct e ecto y t at a o s o ga at o s to auto ate\nthe detection and remediation of identity-based risks. Identity Protection analyzes user account activity as-well as sign-in activity to identify\npotentially compromised accounts or unauthorized authentication requests. Identity Protection data can be leveraged to enhance Conditional\nAccess Policies by enforcing access controls based on user or sign-in risk. Additionally, Identity Protection risk data should be exported to a\nSecurity Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for further correlation and analysis. Note: Azure Identity Protection requires an\nAzure AD Premium P2 License.\n\n**Multi Admin Approval with Intune: To prevent unauthorized changes, organizations utilizing Intune should implement the Multi Admin**\nApproval feature. This feature enforces a multiple administrative approval process that requires secondary admin approval before modifying or\ncreating Script and App deployments. Note: As of February 2023, Multi Admin Approval is in Public Preview and does not yet support request\nnotifications. Requests will need to be manually communicated to expedite the approval workflow. Microsoft has more information regarding\nMulti Admin Approval.\n\n### Additional Security Controls\n\n**Block Office Macros: While Microsoft has changed the default behavior of Office applications to block macros from the internet, Mandiant still**\nrecommends Organizations proactively deploy policies to control and enforce the behavior of office files containing macros. Microsoft has more\ninformation on using policies to manage how Office handles macros.\n\n**Disable Disk Image Auto-Mount: Mandiant has observed UNC2970 utilize trojanized ISO files containing malicious payloads to bypass**\nsecurity controls and trick victims into executing malware. On Windows systems, the option to mount an ISO by “right-clicking” the file then\n[selecting “Mount” from the context menu can be removed by deleting the registry keys associated with image file types (.iso, .img, .vhd, .vhdx).](https://gist.github.com/wdormann/fca29e0dcda8b5c0472e73e10c78c3e7)\nDeleting these registry keys will also prevent a user from auto-mounting an image file by “double-clicking” the file.\n\n**Enhance PowerShell Logging: Increase PowerShell logging to provide security engineers and investigators the visibility needed to detect**\nmalicious activity and provide a historical record of how PowerShell was used on systems. For additional details regarding enhancing\n[PowerShell logging, please reference to the Mandiant blog post, “Greater Visibility Through PowerShell Logging”.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/greater-visibility)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**IOC** **Signature**\n\ne97b13b7e91edeceeac876c3869cc4eb PLANKWALK\n\na9e30c16df400c3f24fc4e9d76db78ef PLANKWALK\n\nf910ffb063abe31e87982bad68fd0d87 PLANKWALK\n\n30358639af2ecc217bbc26008c5640a7 LIDSHIFT\n\n41dcd8db4371574453561251701107bc LIDSHOT\n\n866f9f205fa1d47af27173b5eb464363 TOUCHSHIFT\n\n8c597659ede15d97914cb27512a55fc7 TOUCHSHIFT\n\na2109276dc704dedf481a4f6c8914c6e TOUCHSHIFT\n\n3bf748baecfc24def6c0393bc2354771 TOUCHSHOT\n\n91b6d6efa5840d6c1f10a72c66e925ce TOUCHKEY\n\n300103aff7ab676a41e47ec3d615ba3f HOOKSHOT\n\n49425d6dedb5f88bddc053cc8fd5f0f4 TOUCHMOVE\n\nabd91676a814f4b50ec357ca1584567e SIDESHOW\n\n05b6f459be513bf6120e9b2b85f6c844 CLOUDBURST\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://webinternal.anyplex[.]com/images/query_image.jsp PLANKWALK C2\n\nhxxp://www.fainstec[.]com/assets/js/jquery/jquery.php PLANKWALK C2\n\nhxxps://ajayjangid[.]in/js/jquery/jquery.php PLANKWALK C2\n\nhxxps://sede.lamarinadevalencia[.]com/tablonEdictal/layout/contentLayout.jsp PLANKWALK C2\n\nhxxps://leadsblue[.]com/wp-content/wp-utility/index.php LIDSHOT C2\n\nhxxps://toptradenews[.]com/wp-content/themes/themes.php SIDESHOW C2\n\nhxxp://mantis.quick.net[.]pl/library/securimage/index.php SIDESHOW C2\n\nhxxp://www.keewoom.co[.]kr/prod_img/201409/prod.php SIDESHOW C2\n\nhxxp://abba-servicios[.]mx/wordpress/wp-content/themes/config.php SIDESHOW C2\n\nhxxp://www.ruscheltelefonia[.]com.br/public/php/index.php SIDESHOW C2\n\nhxxps://olidhealth[.]com/wp-includes/php-compat/compat.php CLOUDBURST C2\n\nhxxps://doug[.]org/wp-includes/admin.php CLOUDBURST C2\n\nhxxps://crickethighlights[.]today/wp-content/plugins/contact.php CLOUDBURST C2\n\n## Mandiant Security Validation Actions\n\n[Organizations can validate their security controls using the following actions with Mandiant Security Validation.](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/security-validation)\n\n**VID** **Name**\n\nA105-491 Command and Control - QUESTDOWN, Exfiltration, Variant #1\n\nA105-492 Command and Control - QUESTDOWN, Exfiltration, Variant #2\n\nA105-493 Command and Control - QUESTDOWN, Next Stage Download Attempt, Variant #1\n\nA105-494 Command and Control - QUESTDOWN, Status, Variant #1\n\nA105-507 Phishing Email - Malicious Attachment, PLANKWALK Downloader, Variant #1\n\nA105-508 Phishing Email - Malicious Attachment, QUESTDOWN Dropper, Variant #1\n\nA105-514 Protected Theater - QUESTDOWN, Execution, Variant #1\n\nS100-218 Malicious Activity Scenario - Campaign 22-046, QUESTDOWN Infection\n\n## Signatures\n\n### PLANKWALK\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n rule M_Hunt_APT_PLANKWALK_Code_String {\n  meta:\n   author = \"Mandiant\"\n   description = \"Detects a format string containing code and token found in PLANKWALK\"\n  strings:\n   $hex = { 63 6F 64 65 [1-6] 3D 25 64 26 [1-6] 75 73 65 72 [1-6] 3D 25 73 26 [1-6] 74 6F 6B 65  }\n  condition:\n   (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550) and $hex\n }\n\n### LIDSHIFT\n rule M_APT_Loader_Win_LIDSHIFT_1 {\n  meta:\n    author = \"Mandiant\"\n    description = \"Detects LIDSHIFT implant\"\n   strings:\n    $anchor1 = \"%s:%s:%s\" ascii\n    $encloop = { 83 ?? 3F 72 ??
