It is built to steal OpenSSH credentials and\nmaintain access to a compromised server.\n\n21 Feb 2014 - 03:35PM\n\nIn this blog post, we provide an in-depth analysis of Linux/Ebury – the most sophisticated\nLinux backdoor ever seen by our researchers. It is built to steal OpenSSH credentials and\nmaintain access to a compromised server.\n\n[ESET has been analyzing and tracking an OpenSSH backdoor and credential stealer](http://openssh.org/)\nnamed Linux/Ebury. The result of this work on the Linux/Ebury malware family is part of a\njoint research effort with [CERT‑Bund, the](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/IT-Crisis-Management/Cert-Bund/cert-bund_node.html) [Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing,](http://www.snic.vr.se/)\n\n\n-----\n\nthe [European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and other organizations forming](http://home.web.cern.ch/about)\nan international Working Group.\n\nIn this blog post, we provide an in-depth analysis of Linux/Ebury. It is a sophisticated\nbackdoor used to steal OpenSSH credentials and maintain access to a compromised\n[server. According to previous reports, this backdoor has been in the wild for at least two](http://plog.sesse.net/blog/tech/2011-11-15-21-44_ebury_a_new_ssh_trojan.html)\nyears. Linux/Ebury comes in two different shapes: a malicious library and a patch to the\nmain OpenSSH binaries. The malicious library is a modified version of libkeyutils.so.\nThis shared library is loaded by all OpenSSH executables files such as ssh, sshd and\n```\nssh-agent. We will describe how the backdoor works and how the OpenSSH\n\n```\nfunctionalities are hooked. We will also show how passwords are captured and exfiltrated.\nFinally, we will provide detailed information on how system administrators can identify\ninfected systems.\n\nIf a system is found to be infected with Linux/Ebury, we strongly recommend re-installing the\noperating system. It is also very important to consider all credentials used to log into this\nmachine as compromised. All passwords and private OpenSSH keys should be changed\n\n## Known variants\n\nLinux/Ebury is noteworthy for multiple reasons. Although this is something common under\nthe Windows operating system, it is the first time we’ve seen a malicious library being used\non [POSIX systems. Linux/Ebury also uses innovative tricks to hook functions, discover the](http://www.opengroup.org/austin/)\n[address space of the ELF executable that loaded the library and apply patches to its code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)\nat runtime. We believe that before using the external library to hook into OpenSSH\nprocesses, the author of Linux/Ebury used a patch to modify the source code of OpenSSH,\nthereby adding “new functionalities” to the software. The first variants found were modified\nbinaries left on the disk. The three affected files are ssh, sshd and ssh-add. We have\n[also seen usage of the rpm commands to remove signature from the original OpenSSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager)\npackages (openssh-server, openssh-clients) and modify the RPM database to\nupdate the file hashes with those of the malicious files. This will make the output of rpm -```\nverify openssh-servers report the files as unmodified. However, the output from rpm\n-qi openssh-servers will clearly show the package is missing its signatures.\n\n```\nLater variants of Linux/Ebury do not modify the OpenSSH files directly. Instead, a shared\nlibrary that is loaded by all OpenSSH executable files is modified to change the behaviour\nof the programs. The changes are the same as the patched OpenSSH variants, except that\nthe some functions are hooked and patches to the original code are applied at run time. The\nshared library that is modified on the system is libkeyutils.so. Usually, this file is about\n10KB in size. The malware adds approximately 20KB of additional malicious code, making\nthe file weigh in at about 30KB in total.\n\n\n-----\n\nHere are two examples of how the backdoor is deployed. The first one shows a\nLinux/Ebury-infected file next to the clean libkeyutils.so. The symbolic link is modified\nto point the rogue version.\n\nThe second screenshot shows the libkeyutils.so is replaced with Linux/Ebury’s\nversion.\n\nAlthough placing malicious code inside libraries has already been seen before, this is the\nfirst time we have observed this technique being used on the Linux operating system to\nmodify the behaviour of OpenSSH.\n\n[To enable the different features of the malware, a constructor function was added in](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#index-g_t_0040code_007bconstructor_007d-function-attribute-2825)\nthe libkeyutils.so. This function is called when the library is loaded. This function\ndetects which binary it was loaded from, applies patches to the original code, and hooks\nfunctions from the original import table.\n\nIn the most recent variants of Linux/Ebury, strings are obfuscated with a simple XOR\nencryption with a static key. After unpacking, the malware loads various functions it requires\nusing multiple calls to the dlsym function. Linux/Ebury then discovers the original\nexecutable address space by calling dlopen(NULL, RTLD_NOW) and passing the returned\n[handle to dlinfo(handle, RTLD_DI_LINKMAP, …). This will work even if ASLR is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization)\nenabled on a system. This behaviour gives Linux/Ebury the ability to walk the import table\nof an ELF executable and replace the original imported function address in memory. The\nresult is that when the programsssh, sshd or ssh-add call one of the hooked function, it\nwill be redirected to the malicious libkeyutils.so implementation that can replace the original\nbehaviour. The following code snippet shows the calls to dlopen and dlinfo to find the main\nprogram address space and walk the ELF header information:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe logging functions are hooked so that whenever the backdoor is used, nothing gets sent\nto the logging facility, leaving no trace of the backdoor in the log files on disk. If the\nbackdoor is not in use, logging will behave normally and function calls will get redirected to\nthe original function implementation.\n\nThe following functions are hooked when the malicious libkeyutils.so is loaded inside\nthe sshd process.\n```\n   audit_log_user_message\n   audit_log_acct_message\n   hosts_access\n   connect\n   __syslog_chk\n   write\n   syslog\n   popen\n   hosts_access\n   crypt\n   pam_start\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe other functions such as pam_start and crypt are used to get the password used\nby a user to authenticate. Interestingly, the pam_start hook will place an additional hook\nfor pam_authenticate to grab the password. The function connect is hooked so that\nwhen the Xbnd (documented below) command is used, a call to bind is made with the\nsocket before the real call to connect is made.\n\n## Runtime code modification\n\nWhen hooking from the import table is not an option, Linux/Ebury will modify the code\nsegment by patching specific sections of the program to redirect call instruction to its own\nimplementation. The following figure shows an example where the ssh program calls its\nown function key_parse_private_pem and the execution flow is redirected to malicious\ncode. The address is shown in red because it is in the libkeyutils.so address space,\noutside ssh’s. The hook will call the original implementation and log the private key in\nmemory that will later be fetched by the operators.\n\nBefore attempting to modify the code segment, the program carefully sets a handler to\nintercept any segmentation fault it may cause. More specifically, the handler will be called if\n[the process receives a SIGSEGV or SIGBUS signal. In the case such signal is caught,](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Program-Error-Signals.html)\nLinux/Ebury will simply abort its task and let the OpenSSH do its legitimate behavior. The\nway to recover from a segmentation fault is interesting. Before doing something that could\n[potentially crash the process, sigsetjmp is called to create a snapshot of the current state.](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/sigsetjmp.html)\n[Then, if an access violation ever happens, siglongjmp is used in the signal hander to](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7990989799/xsh/siglongjmp.html)\nrestore to the previous state.\n\nThis code patching technique is limited because offsets of code to patch is hardcoded\ninside the libkeyutils.so trojan. Thus, its effectiveness is limited to the binary targeted by the\nvariant. Typically each libkeyutils.so variant will work for 3 to 5 different OpenSSH\nbuilds from a specific Linux distribution.\n\n## Functionalities\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor is activated by sending specially-crafted data inside of the SSH client\nprotocol version identification string. Here is what the SSH specification has to say about\nprotocol version identification.\n```\nAfter the socket is opened, the server sends an identification\nstring, which is of the form \"SSH-<protocolmajor>.<protocolminor><version>\\n\", where <protocolmajor> and <protocolminor> are\nintegers and specify the protocol version number (not software\ndistribution version). <version> is server side software version\nstring (max 40 characters); it is not interpreted by the remote\nside but may be useful for debugging.\n\n```\nhttp://www.openssh.com/txt/ssh-rfc-v1.5.txt — T. Ylonen\n\nThe <version> portion could be anything and should not be interpreted by the SSH\nserver. In the case of a Linux/Ebury backdoor connection, the <version> contains a\nhexadecimal string of twenty-two (22) characters or more. It embeds an eleven (11)\ncharacter password that is first encrypted with the client IP address and then encoded as a\nhexadecimal string; optionally a four (4) byte command may be encrypted and encoded as\nwell after the password.\n\nNote that the protocol version identification is also sent before the encryption handshake is\ndone, making it possible to flag potential intrusion detection from a network trace.\n\nAn example SSH protocol version to start a root shell looks like this:\n\n```\nSSH-2.0-fb54c28ba102cd73c1fe43\n\n```\n\nOnce the backdoor password is verified, the sshd process will allow any password to work\nduring a password authentication.\nIf PermitRootLogin, PasswordAuthentication or PermitEmptyPassword is\ndisabled, it will enable them to make sure it works. It will also disable all logging of the\nsuccessful session creation. It will be like nothing happened.In version 1.3.1 and newer, a\nSHA-1 sum of the password is kept in the binary instead of an eleven (11) character string\n(basic security practice by the Linux/Ebury’s authors). This makes guessing of the password\nimpractical unless you have a packet capture of the operators logging in successfully.\nFurthermore, the password is different from one variant to another. This leads us to think\nthe operators have a database of infected servers with corresponding backdoor passwords\nso they can activate each backdoor successfully.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main purpose of the Linux/Ebury module is to steal credentials. The stolen credentials\nare most likely used to infect more servers. There is no code in Linux/Ebury to propagate\nitself; the backdoor is probably spread manually by an attacker or installed through\ndeployment scripts.\n\n### Credential Stealing\n\nCredentials are intercepted at multiple locations, when they are typed or used by the victim:\n\n**Password from successful login to the infected server: Whenever someone logs**\nin a system infected with Linux/Ebury, the sshd daemon will save the password and\nsend it to the exfiltration server.\n\n**Any password login attempt to the infected server: Even if the attempt is**\nunsuccessful, the username and password used will be sent to the operators. They\nwill be formatted differently, however, allowing the operators to differentiate these\ninvalid credentials from the valid ones.\n\n**Password on successful login from the infected server: When someone uses**\nthe ssh client on an infected server, Linux/Ebury will intercept the password and sent it\nto its exfiltration server.\n\n**Private key passphrase: When the ssh client on an infected server prompts the user**\nfor an private key passphrase, the passphrase will be sent to the remote exfiltration\nserver.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Unencrypted private key: When a private key is used to authenticate to a remote**\nserver, the unencrypted version is intercepted by the malware. Unlike passwords, it\nwill not send the key to the exfiltration server. Instead, it will store it memory and wait\nfor the operators to fetch the key with the Xcat command.\n\n**Private keys added to the OpenSSH agent with ssh-add: The keys added to an**\nOpenSSH agent are also intercepted by the malware. Both the unencrypted key itself\nand the passphrase typed by the user will be logged.\n\nWhatever the credential type, Linux/Ebury will add all relevant information for the operators\nto be able to use it, like the username, the target IP address and its OpenSSH listening\nport.\n\n### Password exfiltration\n\nWhen a password is intercepted by Linux/Ebury, the information is sent to a remote server\nvia a crafted DNS request sent to a specific IP address. The malware creates a\nregular A record request that will be sent on UDP port 53. The domain name requested\ncontains encrypted and hexadecimal-encoded data as well as an IP address. The data has\nthe following format:\n```\n<hexadecimal-encoded data>.<IP address>\n\n```\nThe <hexadecimal-encoded data> contains the credentials previously described. It is\n```\nXOR encrypted with the 4-byte static key 0x000d5345 before being hexadecimal-encoded.\n\n```\nThe IP address included in the query depends on the type of stolen credentials. If the\ncredentials are for the infected server itself, the client IP address is used. Otherwise, the\nremote IP address where the infected server is connecting to is used.\n\nWe believe the malware authors chose to send packets that look like legitimate DNS\nrequests over UDP port 53 to avoid being blocked by firewalls. It is very common to whitelist\nDNS requests in firewall configurations because blocking them could disrupt name\nresolution.\n\nThere are 2 ways by which Linux/Ebury can choose a server where the DNS packets are\nsent. First, it can be set explicitly by the operator when sending an Xver command. The\nsecond method uses an algorithm to generate a domain name dynamically. This domain\nname will be queried for its A and TXT records. The TXT record will be used to verify that it\nis under the control of the operators using public key cryptography. Details about the\ndomain generation algorithm and the verification processed will be published later.\n\n### Extra commands\n\n\n-----\n\nThree commands are available to the malicious actors to ease the management of the\ncompromised server. A command is appended to the backdoor password before being\nencrypted. When the backdoor identifies a command, it interprets it instead of starting a\nshell. Here is a list of commands that can be processed by the backdoor:\n```\n   Xcat: print all the passwords, passphrases, and keys saved in the shared memory\n\n```\nand exit.\n```\n   Xver: print the installed Linux/Ebury version and exit. Xver also accept an optional\n\n```\nfour (4) byte argument. If present, it will set the exfiltration server IP address to the\ngiven one.\n```\n   Xbnd: Xbnd takes a four (4) byte argument. When creating a tunnel to a remote host,\n\n```\nbind the client socket to the specified interface IP address.\n\n## Version tracking\n\nThe authors of Linux/Ebury have a good practice of leaving version number inside their\nbinaries. This allows operators to know what version is installed on each system. It also\nhelped researchers understand the chronology of events and sort samples more easily.\n\nFor example, since version 1.3.2, Linux/Ebury will not send any information to a remote\nserver if an interface is in promiscuous mode. An interface is set to promiscuous mode\nwhen software like tcpdump is capturing the traffic on a network interface. The authors\n[probably added this feature in reaction to an article from cPanel about Linux/Ebury that](http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/CompSystem)\nsuggested running tcpdump to monitor DNS requests and notice exfiltration data as an\nindicator of compromise.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nWe will provide two means of identifying the presence of the Linux/Ebury SSH backdoor.\nThe easiest way to identify an infected server relies on the presence of a feature added by\nthe malware to the ssh binary. A longer process involves inspection of the shared memory\nsegments used by the malware.\n\nThe command ssh -G has a different behaviour on a system with Linux/Ebury. A clean\nserver will print\n```\nssh: illegal option -- G\n\n```\nto stderr but an infected server will only print the typical “usage” message. One can use\nthe following command to determine if the server he is on is compromised:\n```\n$ ssh -G 2>&1 | grep -e illegal -e unknown > /dev/null && echo\n\"System clean\" || echo \"System infected\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nLinux/Ebury relies on POSIX shared memory segments (SHMs) for interprocess\ncommunications. The current version uses large segments of over 3 megabytes of memory\nwith broad permissions allowing everyone to read and write to this segment.\n\nOther processes could legitimately create shared memory segments with broad\npermissions. Make sure to validate that sshd is the process that created the segment like\nwe show below.\n\nOne can identify large shared memory segment with broad permissions by running the\nfollowing as root:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\n# ipcs -m\n\n------ Shared Memory Segments -------\nkey    shmid   owner   perms   bytes   nattch\n\n0x00000000 0     root   644    80     2\n\n0x00000000 32769   root   644    16384   2\n\n0x00000000 65538   root   644    280    2\n\n0x000010e0 465272836 root   666    3282312  0\n\n\nThen to look for the process that created the shared memory segment, use:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\n# ipcs -m -p\n\n------ Shared Memory Creator/Last-op PIDs -------\nshmid   owner   cpid    lpid\n\n0     root    4162    4183\n\n32769   root    4162    4183\n\n65538   root    4162    4183\n\n465272836 root    15029   17377\n\n\nIf the process matches sshd:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n# ps aux | grep &lt;pid&gt;\n\nroot   11531 0.0 0.0 103284  828 pts/0  S+  16:40  0:00 grep 15029\n\nroot   15029 0.0 0.0 66300 1204 ?    Ss  Jan26  0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd\n\n\nAn sshd process using shared memory segments larger than three (3) megabytes\n(3,145,728 bytes) and with broad permissions (666) is a strong indicator of compromise.\n\n### Network-based indicators\n\n[We are providing simple snort rules in order to easily pinpoint malicious activity in large](http://snort.org/)\nnetworks. The Internet being a wild place these have greater chances of triggering false\npositives. Use wisely.\n\nThis first rule matches against the SSH Client Protocol field that the backdoor uses to\nconnect to a victim. Any external host trying to connect to the backdoor on properly\nidentified SSH ports will trigger the alert.\n\n1 alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -&gt; $HOME_NET $SSH_PORTS\n(msg:\"Linux/Ebury SSH backdoor activty\"; content:\"SSH-2.0\"; isdataat:20,relative;\npcre:\"/^SSH-2\\.0-[0-9a-f]{22,46}/sm\"; reference:url,/2014/02/21/an-in-depth-analysisof-linuxebury/; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:1000001; rev:1;)\n\nThe following Snort rule for detecting Linux/Ebury infected machines sending harvested\n[credentials to a exfiltration server has been provided by CERT‑Bund.](https://www.cert-bund.de/ebury-faq)\n\n1 alert udp $HOME_NET any -&gt; $EXTERNAL_NET 53 (msg:\"Linux/Ebury SSH\nbackdoor data exfiltration\"; content:\"|12 0b 01 00 00 01|\"; depth:6;\npcre:\"/^\\x12\\x0b\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x01[\\x00]{6}.[a-f0-9]{6,}(([\\x01|\\x02|\\x03]\\d{1,3})\n{4}|\\x03::1)\\x00\\x00\\x01/Bs\"; reference:url,/2014/02/21/an-in-depth-analysis-oflinuxebury/; reference:url,https://www.cert-bund.de/ebury-faq; classtype:trojan-activity;\nsid:1000002; rev:1;)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Linux/Ebury malware clearly is a complex threat with many interesting features such as\ncode hooking, advanced POSIX exception handling and various ways of hiding itself on an\ninfected system. Based on data we captured, we estimate that thousands of systems are\ncurrently infected with Linux/Ebury. We feel it is important to specify that we have not\nwitnessed a weakness in the OpenSSH software itself. The Linux/Ebury trojan propagates\n\n\n-----\n\nusing the stolen credentials collected by the operators. With the administrator s credentials,\nthere is no need for a “0-day” exploit, although how the operators bootstrapped the whole\ncredential stealing operation is still a mystery.\n\n## File Details\n\nTrojanized libkeyutils.so file SHA-1 hashes.\n```\n09c8af3be4327c83d4a7124a678bbc81e12a1de4 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\n2e571993e30742ee04500fbe4a40ee1b14fa64d7 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.4\n39ec9e03edb25f1c316822605fe4df7a7b1ad94a – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\n3c5ec2ab2c34ab57cba69bb2dee70c980f26b1bf – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\n471ee431030332dd636b8af24a428556ee72df37 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.2.1\n5d3ec6c11c6b5e241df1cc19aa16d50652d6fac0 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.3\n74aa801c89d07fa5a9692f8b41cb8dd07e77e407 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\n7adb38bf14e6bf0d5b24fa3f3c9abed78c061ad1 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\n9bb6a2157c6a3df16c8d2ad107f957153cba4236 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\n9e2af0910676ec2d92a1cad1ab89029bc036f599 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.3\nadfcd3e591330b8d84ab2ab1f7814d36e7b7e89f – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\nbf1466936e3bd882b47210c12bf06cb63f7624c0 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\nd552cbadee27423772a37c59cb830703b757f35e – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.3\ne14da493d70ea4dd43e772117a61f9dbcff2c41c – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\nf1ada064941f77929c49c8d773cbad9c15eba322 – Linux/Ebury – Version 1.3.2\n\n## References\n\n```\nCERT‑Bund: Ebury FAQ – [https://www.cert-bund.de/ebury-faq](https://www.cert-bund.de/ebury-faq)\n\ncPanel – [http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/CompSystem](http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/CompSystem)\n\nDr. Web – [http://news.drweb.com/show/?i=3600&lng=en&c=5](http://news.drweb.com/show/?i=3600&lng=en&c=5)\n\n[Dr.Web – http://news.drweb.com/?i=3332&lng=en](http://news.drweb.com/?i=3332&lng=en)\n\nGunderson, Steinar – http://plog.sesse.net/blog/tech/2011-11-15-2144_ebury_a_new_ssh_trojan.html\n\nSANS [https://isc.sans.edu/diary/SSHD+rootkit+in+the+wild/15229](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/SSHD+rootkit+in+the+wild/15229)\n\n[WebHosting Talk – http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1235797](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1235797)\n\n21 Feb 2014 - 03:35PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
