data\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-unix-rootkit-used-to-steal-atm-banking-data/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-unix-rootkit-used-to-steal-atm-banking-data/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nMarch 17, 2022\n06:23 PM\n0\n\nThreat analysts following the activity of LightBasin, a financially motivated group of hackers,\nreport the discovery of a previously unknown Unix rootkit that is used to steal ATM banking\ndata and conduct fraudulent transactions.\n\n[The particular group of adversaries has been recently observed targeting telecom companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lightbasin-hacking-group-breaches-13-global-telecoms-in-two-years/)\nwith custom implants, while back in 2020, they were spotted compromising managed service\n[providers and victimizing their clients.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/live-off-the-land-an-overview-of-unc1945)\n\nIn a new report by Mandiant, researchers present further evidence of LightBasin activity,\nfocusing on bank card fraud and the compromise of crucial systems.\n\n## Tapping into your banking data\n\n\n-----\n\nLightBasin s new rootkit is a Unix kernel module named Caketap that is deployed on\nservers running the Oracle Solaris operating system.\n\nWhen loaded, Caketap hides network connections, processes, and files while installing\nseveral hooks into system functions to receive remote commands and configurations.\n\nThe commands observed by the analysts are the following:\n\nAdd the CAKETAP module back to the loaded modules list\nChange the signal string for the getdents64 hook\nAdd a network filter (format p)\nRemove a network filter\nSet the current thread TTY to not to be filtered by the getdents64 hook\nSet all TTYs to be filtered by the getdents64 hook\nDisplays the current configuration\n\nThe ultimate goal of Caketap is to intercept banking card and PIN verification data from\nbreached ATM switch servers and then use the stolen data to facilitate unauthorized\ntransactions.\n\nThe messages intercepted by Caketap are destined for the Payment Hardware Security\nModule (HSM), a tamper-resistant hardware device used in the banking industry for\ngenerating, managing, and validating cryptographic keys for PINs, magnetic stripes, and\nEMV chips.\n\nCaketap manipulates the card verification messages to disrupt the process, stops those that\nmatch fraudulent bank cards, and generates a valid response instead.\n\nIn a second phase, it saves valid messages that match non-fraudulent PANs (Primary\nAccount Numbers) internally and sends them to the HSM so that routine customer\ntransactions aren't affected and the implant operations remain stealthy.\n\n“We believe that CAKETAP was leveraged by UNC2891 (LightBasin) as part of a larger\noperation to successfully use fraudulent bank cards to perform unauthorized cash\n[withdrawals from ATM terminals at several banks,” explains Mandiant’s report.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2891-overview)\n\nOther tools linked to the actor in previous attacks include Slapstick, Tinyshell, Steelhound,\nSteelcorgi, Wingjook, Wingcrack, Binbash, Wiperight, and the Mignogcleaner, all of which\nMandiant confirmed as still deployed in LightBasin attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LightBasin uses Caketap, Slapstick, and Tinyshell in every step** _(Mandiant)_\n\n## Sophisticated targeting\n\nLightBasin is a highly skillful threat actor that takes advantage of relaxed security in missioncritical Unix and Linux systems that are often treated as intrinsically secure or largely ignored\ndue to their obscurity.\n\nThis is precisely where adversaries like LightBasic thrive, and Mandiant expects them to\ncontinue to capitalize on the same operational strategy.\n\nAs for attribution, the analysts spotted some overlaps with the UNC1945 threat cluster but\ndon’t have any concrete links to draw safe conclusions on that front yet.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing
