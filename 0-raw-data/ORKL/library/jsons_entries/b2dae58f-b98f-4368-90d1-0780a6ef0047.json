This approach has\nincluded destructive missile and cyber strikes on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine,\ncyberattacks on Ukrainian and now foreign-based supply chains, and cyber-enabled\ninfluence operations[1]—intended to undermine US, EU, and NATO political support for\nUkraine, and to shake the confidence and determination of Ukrainian citizens.\n\nIn recent months, cyberthreat actors affiliated with Russian military intelligence have\nlaunched destructive wiper attacks against energy, water and other critical infrastructure\norganizations’ networks in Ukraine as missile strikes knocked out power and water supplies\nto civilians across the country. Russian military operators also expanded destructive\ncyberactivity outside Ukraine to Poland, a critical logistics hub, in a possible attempt to\ndisrupt the movement of weapons and supplies to the front.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian propaganda seeks to amplify the intensity of popular dissent over\nenergy and inflation across Europe by boosting select narratives online through stateaffiliated media outlets and social media accounts to undermine elected officials and\n\n\n-----\n\ndemocratic institutions. To date, these have had only limited public impact, but they\nforeshadow what may become broadening tactics during the winter ahead.\n\nWe believe these recent trends suggest that the world should be prepared for several lines of\npotential Russian attack in the digital domain over the course of this winter. First, we can\nexpect a continuation of Russia’s cyber offensive against Ukrainian critical infrastructure. We\nshould also be prepared for the possibility that Russian military intelligence actors’ recent\nexecution of a ransomware-style attack – known as Prestige – in Poland may be a harbinger\nof Russia further extending cyberattacks beyond the borders of Ukraine. Such cyber\noperations may target those countries and companies that are providing Ukraine with vital\nsupply chains of aid and weaponry this winter.\n\nSecond, we should also be prepared for cyber-enabled influence operations that target\nEurope to be conducted in parallel with cyberthreat activity. Russia will seek to exploit cracks\nin popular support for Ukraine to undermine coalitions essential to Ukraine’s resilience,\nhoping to impair the humanitarian and military aid flowing to the region. The good news is\nthat, when equipped with more information, a media-savvy public can act with awareness\nand judgment to counter this threat.\n\nHere’s what we are seeing at Microsoft since Ukraine’s counteroffensive has pushed the\nRussian army into retreat, what we anticipate Russia’s cyber and influence operations might\nlook like headed into the winter months, and how we at Microsoft will help prepare and\nprevent harm to Microsoft customers and democracies facing these attacks.\n\n**Combined missile and cyber strikes focus on destruction of civilian infrastructure**\n\nAs Russia retreated from formerly occupied territory in Ukraine in late October, the Kremlin\nunleashed new missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian cities and the energy and\ntransportation infrastructure that supports them. Missile barrages cut power to more than 10\nmillion Ukrainians and left up to 80% of Kyiv’s population without running water.[2] The intent\nto inflict suffering on Ukraine’s civilians has been clear, and was effectively acknowledged by\nRussian officials.[3]\n\nNotably, these recent missile strikes have been accompanied by cyberattacks on the same\nsectors, perpetrated by a threat group – known at Microsoft by the element name IRIDIUM\nand by others as Sandworm – associated with Russia’s military intelligence service, the\nGRU. The repeated temporal, sectoral and geographic association of these cyberattacks by\nRussian military intelligence with corresponding military kinetic attacks indicate a shared set\nof operational priorities and provides strong circumstantial evidence that the efforts are\ncoordinated, as reflected in the timelines below.\n\nMicrosoft’s research of IRIDIUM shows a history of destructive attacks against Ukraine’s\ncritical energy infrastructure that dates back nearly a decade. Following Russia’s annexation\nof Crimea in 2014, IRIDIUM launched a series of wintertime operations against Ukrainian\n\n\n-----\n\nelectricity providers, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of citizens in 2015 and 2016.[4]\nThe group’s pursuit of destruction in Ukraine spread globally in 2017 with the NotPetya\nattack, which inflicted $10 billion of damage to companies including international firms such\nas Maersk, Merck and Mondelēz, and underscores the risk of this actor’s operations to the\nglobal digital ecosystem.[5]\n\nThe wave of Russian destructive cyberattacks that began on February 23, and subsequent\ndestructive attacks against Ukrainian targets in support of the Russian war effort have been\nthe responsibility of IRIDIUM, as we have previously reported.[6] In October, IRIDIUM’s\ndestructive attacks against Ukrainian critical services networks spiked, after two months of\nlittle to no wiper activity. As the Ukrainian counteroffensive progressed and winter\napproached, Microsoft observed that IRIDIUM deployed Caddywiper and FoxBlade wiper\nmalware to destroy data from networks of organizations involved in power generation, water\nsupply and the transportation of people and goods. The predominant focus was on the Kyiv\nregion, as well as the southern and central-eastern regions of the country, where the physical\nconflict has been the most intense.\n\nCyber and missile strikes on transportation and logistics companies may interfere with the\ntransportation of weapons and supplies. However, such attacks can also disrupt the passage\nof humanitarian aid to Ukrainian citizens, compounding the harm from curtailing the supply of\nelectricity.\n\nThis tactic of targeting civilian infrastructure has been in play since the beginning of the\nconflict. Of the roughly 50 Ukrainian organizations that Russian military operators have hit\nwith destructive wiper malware since February 2022, 55% were critical infrastructure\norganizations, including in the energy, transportation, water, law enforcement and emergency\nservices, and health care sectors.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn most instances, threat actors have deployed wipers against the business networks of the\ntargeted critical infrastructure organizations. However, operational technology networks are\nalso vulnerable. For example, IRIDIUM attempted to inflict severe damage on energy\n[production in April by targeting the industrial control systems (ICS) of a Ukrainian energy](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/12/industroyer2-industroyer-reloaded/)\nprovider.[7] Quick action by CERT-UA and international partners thwarted the attack, but the\nrisk of future ICS attacks that would disrupt or destroy the productive capacity of Ukrainian\npower or water infrastructure is high.\n\n**Russian cyberattacks extend outside Ukraine**\n\nRussian cyber strikes extended outside Ukraine in October, when IRIDIUM deployed its\nnovel Prestige ransomware against several logistics and transportation sector networks in\nPoland and Ukraine.[8] This was the first war-related cyberattack against entities outside of\nUkraine since the Viasat KA-SAT attack at the start of the invasion.[9]\n\nThe Prestige event in October may represent a measured shift in Russia’s cyberattack\nstrategy, reflecting a willingness by Moscow to use its cyberweapons against organizations\noutside Ukraine in support of its ongoing war. Since Spring 2022, Microsoft has observed\nthat IRIDIUM and suspected Russian state operators have targeted transportation and\nlogistics organizations across Ukraine in probable attempts to collect intelligence on or\ndisrupt the flow of military and humanitarian aid through the country. But these recent attacks\nin Poland suggest that Russian state-sponsored cyberattacks may increasingly be used\noutside Ukraine in an effort to undermine foreign-based supply chains.\n\n\n-----\n\nIRIDIUM’s success in the Prestige destructive attack was limited. Early customer notifications\nand rapid response, including from Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team (DART) and\nthe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), along with local incident responders in\nPoland, reportedly helped contain the attack’s impact to less than 20% of one targeted\norganization’s network. However, while the destructive impact was limited, IRIDIUM almost\ncertainly collected intelligence on supply routes and logistics operations that could facilitate\nfuture attacks.\n\nPerhaps in part because the impact was successfully limited by the defenders and\nresponders in this instance, international outcry against this new extension of the hybrid war\nbeyond the borders of Ukraine has been muted. Nevertheless, this attack highlights the\ncontinued risk of Russian destructive cyberattacks to European organizations that directly\nsupply or transport humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n**Cyber-enabled influence operations seek to fuel real-world discord across Europe**\n\nThis winter, European populations seeking to keep warm amid energy shortages and\nheightened inflation will likely be targeted by Russian attempts to stir up and potentially\nmobilize grievances through cyber-enabled influence operations.\n\nSuch operations offer the Kremlin a more deniable but nonetheless effective method of\nshaping discourse around conflict and major geopolitical events. Russia’s “active measures”\napproach involves infiltrating the constituencies of Kremlin adversaries while elevating\ncandidates and officials who share Russia’s preferred foreign policy positions. Since 2014,\nRussia has sought to achieve its objectives “through the force of politics, rather than the\npolitics of force,”[10] across democratic contests including the 2016 Brexit referendum and\n\n\n-----\n\nelections in the US, France and Germany, among others. Russia has also exploited political,\neconomic and social divisions to mobilize citizens and even incite violence inside\ndemocracies. It is likely that these tools will be deployed in Europe and globally to reduce\nsupport for Ukraine’s defense.\n\nRussia has a well-established ability to sway public opinion both in the U.S. and Europe\nthrough cyber-enabled influence operations. In 2016, the Internet Research Agency in St.\nPetersburg, known better as the Russian “troll farm,” famously orchestrated protests in\nTexas[11] and Florida.[12] Earlier that same year, Russian state media ran a story about an\nalleged assault of a young girl by migrants in Germany – accusations later disproved – and\npromoted the narrative that the German government had deliberately concealed the truth.\nThe subsequent media flurry sparked a series of protests within Germany’s sizeable Russian\ndiaspora, who were outraged by what they were being told was failure on the part of the\nGerman justice system.[13]\n\nIn 2018, the same Kremlin trolls involved in the 2016 US presidential election amplified the\n“yellow vest” protests in France. Russia did not organize these protests, but its online\ncampaigns elevated calls to protest President Emmanuel Macron’s government by using a\nblend of overt, state-sponsored media to promote the cause while boosting the movement’s\nhashtag #giletsjaunes via covert accounts online.[14]\n\nOur Digital Threat Analysis Center (DTAC) team closely tracks cyber-enabled influence\noperations. Protests in Europe this fall related to energy, inflation, and the war in Ukraine\nbroadly – and their steady promotion by Russian propaganda outlets – foreshadow additional\noperations we may encounter this winter in support of Russian objectives by seeking to\nincrease European dissatisfaction with energy supply, energy pricing and inflation.[15] If\nenergy and electricity disruptions in Ukraine lead to more refugees throughout Europe,\nRussian cyber-enabled influence operations may seek to increase frictions over migration to\ncreate intra- and inter-country conflicts – a theme visible in the Kremlin’s campaigns over the\nlast decade as refugees fled to Eastern and Central Europe during the Syrian Civil War.[16]\n\nIn the coming months, European nations will likely be subjected to a range of influence\ntechniques tailored to their populations’ concerns about energy prices and inflation more\nbroadly. Russia has and will likely continue to focus these campaigns on Germany, a country\ncritical for maintaining Europe’s unity and home to a large Russian diaspora, seeking to\nnudge popular and elite consensus toward a path favorable to the Kremlin.[17] Strong\nconnections between Kremlin-affiliated ideologues and Germany’s far right will likely be\nleveraged both online and offline in campaigns targeting German audiences with hardline\nnarratives on the war in Ukraine as well as criticism of the government’s handling of the\nenergy crisis.[18]\n\n\n-----\n\nRecent quantitative analyses support these assessments. Microsoft s AI for Good Lab has\ncreated a Russian Propaganda Index (RPI) to monitor the consumption of news from\nRussian state-controlled and state-sponsored news outlets and amplifiers. This index\nmeasures the proportion of this propaganda flow to overall news traffic on the internet. The\nRPI in Germany currently is the highest in Western Europe, over three times the regional\naverage.\n\nHigher Russian propaganda consumption in Germany may be in part due to decades of\nRussian investment in soft power and public diplomacy targeting the country, home to one of\nthe largest Russian diaspora populations in Europe. Many of the soft power organizations’\nexpress purpose is to create people-to-people and party-to-party ties between the two\ncountries, and several Russian state-sponsored media outlets have been based in Germany.\n\n[19] Germany’s large Russian-speaking population, estimated at nearly 6 million people,\nmakes Russian cyber-enabled influence operations and propaganda published in both\nRussian and German more accessible to German audiences.[20] Meanwhile, German policy\nsince the end of the Cold War, during which time Soviet and East German active measures\nefforts were conducted synergistically,[21] has sought a normalization of relations with\nRussia bolstered by economic cooperation, with no greater example than the Nord Stream 2\nnatural gas pipeline. U.S. sanctions against this project, unpopular in both Russia and\nGermany, gave anti-Western and pro-Russian propaganda and influence operations,\nparticularly on economic and energy topics, a more sympathetic audience.[22]\n\nThroughout Western Europe, readers are exposed to Russian propaganda on both Russianlanguage sites – including Russian state-owned media sites – and local-language, proRussia sites. Consumption of local-language sites in Germany is three times higher than the\nWestern European average, in keeping with Germany’s high levels of Russian propaganda\nconsumption in the aggregate. In Germany, the local-language sites that generate the most\ntraffic are anti-spiegel.ru, uncutnews.ch and the German-language edition of Russia\nToday (RT), de.rt.com. Local sites focus more attention on local issues. Anti-Spiegel in\nparticular has focused its content on leveraging the current economic climate to promote the\nKremlin and vilify the West. The headlines of its three most-read articles, for example, from\nthe last four months are:\n\n1. “That the US wants to destroy the German economy is considered a conspiracy theory\n\nand Russian propaganda, but it is obvious.”[23]\n2. “The Nord Stream pipelines have been blown up and the Western media are staging\n\nwhat is arguably the stupidest propaganda operation ever.”[24]\n3. “I am often asked why I am so convinced that Russian President Putin is not part of\n\n[the World Economic Forum] & Co. and its new world order. Here I want to answer\nthat.”[25]\n\n\n-----\n\nAside from Germany, many other European nations may also need to reckon with the\ncombined weight of Russian meddling and organic popular discontent. Earlier this year,\nRussia-affiliated threat actor SEABORGIUM (which overlaps with threat groups tracked as\nCallisto Group, TA446 and COLDRIVER) targeted the UK, utilizing allegedly stolen material\nto sow distrust in the British government,[26] while pro-Russia media like Modern Diplomacy\nand Strategic Culture Foundation, an outlet directed by the Russian Foreign Intelligence\nService (SVR),[27] publish content alleging British involvement in the Kerch Strait Bridge\nexplosion.[28]\n\nOngoing protests in the Czech Republic, meanwhile, have promoted Russia’s talking points\non energy and are repeatedly featured in Russian state-owned and state-affiliated media.[29]\nLadislav Vrábel – one of the organizers of the protest movement Czech Republic First – has\nbeen a repeated guest on Russian media such as Sputnik News since protests began,[30]\nwhile PolitNavigator – a Russian-language site reportedly directed by the FSB[31] – sent a\ncorrespondent to cover the protests from the beginning.[32] Further, among public figures\nwho supported and spoke at the demonstrations are several politicians with long and welldocumented records of pro-Russian activity, such as unofficial trips to occupied Crimea and\nhigh-level involvement with Kremlin-funded biker gang Night Wolves.[33]\n\nFrance, not as reliant on Russian gas as its neighbors, is perhaps less vulnerable to energyrelated influence. However, there is an ongoing risk that Russian agencies will seek to\nmeddle in French affairs through inauthentic social media campaigns – building on previous\nefforts[34] and its success seeding and exploiting anti-French sentiment throughout Africa\nvia propaganda, fake think tanks, and local engagement – which point to Russia’s\nwillingness undermine French leadership.[35] Finally, Italy, with rising energy costs,[36]\nemerges as an additional target.\n\n**Defending the digital domain this winter: A way forward**\n\n[In our June 2022 report, Defending Ukraine: Early Lessons from the Cyber War, Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/22/defending-ukraine-early-lessons-from-the-cyber-war/)\noffered a methodology for combating digital threats. Multidimensional threats require\nmultidimensional defenses. At Microsoft, we’ve built our approach around “Four Ds” to\ncounter malicious cyber and influence activity. Throughout the winter and into 2023, we will\nbe working with our customers and in support of democracies to:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Detect: Collectively identify, across Microsoft s threat intelligence teams, those cyber**\nactors that may strike at supply chains supporting Ukraine and the energy industry\nkeeping Europe warm this winter. We will also evaluate cyberattacks to determine\nwhich are designed to limit support and supplies to Ukraine and which may be part of\nbroader hack-and-leak operations designed to undermine unity of support for Ukraine.\nFor customers, we’ll preemptively evaluate and assess potential risks to those that may\nbe targets of Russia or other nation state threat actors. This vulnerability assessment\nwill closely evaluate transportation, defense and energy companies Microsoft serves to\nhelp increase the collective speed of detection and response. Microsoft will also\ncontinue to track and identify Russian cyber-enabled influence operations, publishing\nour findings to notify the public and industry partners to improve information integrity of\nour own platforms and broader detection efforts.\n**Disrupt: Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) will alert customers and the**\npublic to emerging cyber methods enabling the entire ecosystem to rapidly employ\nsensors, patches, and mitigations. Where we encounter cyber-enabled influence\ncampaigns, we will pursue a similar strategy, shining a light on operations aimed at\ncreating doubt, distrust or dissent within Ukraine or across its partners seeking to\nundermine support for Ukraine. Our team will share this information with our customers\nand the public to these operations and lessen their impact.\n**Defend: Microsoft will increase the collective defenses of the broader cyber ecosystem**\nthrough increased information sharing and improved technology to defend against\nRussian threats and address vulnerabilities. Our teams will continue to support\nnonprofits, journalists and academics both within Ukraine and across allies, allowing\nthose partners to broaden their defense of the information ecosystem. For example,\nMicrosoft recently partnered with International Media Support (IMS) and the Center for\nStrategic Communication and Information Security within Ukraine to improve rapid\ninformation sharing and response between the private sector, NGOs and journalists\nwithin Ukraine through a dedicated secure communications hub.\n**Deter: Microsoft has been dedicated for more than a decade to securing international**\nnorms for cyberspace. This winter, our Digital Diplomacy and Democracy Forward\nteams will work with affected customers and their representative governments to push\nfor unified action to protect our customers’ supply chains against nation state attacks.\nAnd we will continue our ongoing efforts to provide actionable threat intelligence to\nentities targeted or compromised by Russian actors in Ukraine and in the countries\nsupporting its defense.\n\nFinally, for customers, Microsoft encourages the use of strong cyber hygiene and the latest\ndetection and response technology to reduce vulnerabilities to and recover from cyberattacks\n– a listing of these specific recommendations can be found in the recently released Microsoft\nDigital Defense Report (MDDR) 2022.[37]\n\n\n-----\n\nUkraine has fought a brave defense both online and on-the-ground against a merciless\nRussian assault. With the help of its partner nations, companies and democratic citizens, we\nall can ensure that Ukraine and Europe’s infrastructure is protected and democracy resilient\nin the face of authoritarianism this winter.\n\n[1] Cyber-enabled influence operations refer to targeted, online information campaigns\n_designed to shift public opinion through manipulative or subversive means._\n\n[2]\n\n_[3] Following the attack, Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary,_\n_implied Russia’s intentions with its strikes on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure is to force_\n_President Zelenskyy to negotiate._\n\n_[4]_ _[https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-kremlin-most-dangerous-hackers/](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-kremlin-most-dangerous-hackers/)_\n\n_[5]_ _https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/3-years-after-notpetya-many-_\n_organizations-still-in-danger-of-similar-attacks_\n\n_[6]_ _https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/22/defending-ukraine-early-lessons-_\n_from-the-cyber-war/_\n\n[7]\n\n_[8]_ _https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/14/new-prestige-ransomware-_\n_impacts-organizations-in-ukraine-and-poland/_\n\n_[9]_ _[https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/russia-viasat-cyberattack/](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/russia-viasat-cyberattack/)_\n\n_[10]_ _https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/so-what-did-we-learn-looking-back-on-four-years-_\n_of-russias-cyber-enabled-active-measures/_\n\n_[11]_ _https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/10/08/russian-trolls-orchestrated-2016-_\n_clash-houston-islamic-center-senate-intel-report-says/_\n\n_[12]_ _https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-appear-to-use-facebook-to-push-pro-trump-_\n_flash-mobs-in-florida_\n\n[13]\n\n_[14]_ _https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/17/gilets-jaunes-grassroots-heroes-or-_\n_kremlin-tools_\n\n[15]\n\n[16]\n\n[17]\n\n\n-----\n\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\n_[20]_ _https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-russian-community-faces-harassment-and-hostility/a-_\n_61055867_\n\n[21]\n\n_[22]_ _https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/world/europe/germany-russia-nord-stream-_\n_pipeline.html_\n\n_[23]_ _https://www.anti-spiegel.ru/2022/mit-hilfe-der-gruenen-die-usa-planen-die-zerstoerung-_\n_der-deutschen-wirtschaft/_\n\n_[24]_ _https://www.anti-spiegel.ru/2022/nord-stream-gesprengt-die-wohl-duemmste-_\n_propaganda-aller-zeiten/_\n\n_[25]_ _https://www.anti-spiegel.ru/2022/sitzt-putin-mit-schwabs-weltwirtschaftsforum-co-in-_\n_einem-boot/_\n\n_[26]_ _https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-_\n_ongoing-phishing-operations/_\n\n_[27]_ _[https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126)_\n\n_[28]_ _https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/10/14/the-grayzone-ukraine-blew-up-kerch-bridge-_\n_british-spies-plotted-it,_ _https://strategic-culture.org/news/2022/10/13/before-ukraine-blew-up-_\n_kerch-bridge-british-spies-plotted-it_\n\n[29]\n\n[30]\n\n_[31]_ _https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-coronavirus-pandemic-health-moscow-media-_\n_ff4a56b7b08bcdc6adaf02313a85edd9_\n\n[32]\n\n[33]\n\n[34]\n\n[35]\n\n[36]\n\n_[37]_ _https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-insider/threat-_\n_guidance/using-cybersecurity-to-help-manage-volatility-in-the-global-threat-landscape/_\n\n\n-----",
