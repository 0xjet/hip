At the time, the learning curve for\nunderstanding its functionality was rather steep and analysis required specific\nknowledge of a manufacturer's ATM API functions and parameters, which were not\npublicly documented.\n\nBefore the discovery of Skimer, anti-malware researchers' considered ATMs secure\nmachines containing proprietary hardware, running non-standard operating systems,\nand implementing a number of advanced protection techniques designed to prevent\nattacks using malicious code. Researchers eventually discovered that the most popular\nATM manufacturers use a standard Windows operating system and add on some\nauxiliary devices, such as a safe and card reader.\n\nOver time, actors behind some of the newer ATM malware families such as\nGreenDispenser and Tyupkin realized that there is a generic Windows extension for\nFinancial Services API (CEN/XFS) that can be used to make malware that runs\nindependent of the underlying hardware platform, as long as the ATM manufacturer\nsupports the framework. This malware can trick the machines into dispensing cash,\nregardless of whether the attacker has a legitimate bank card.\n\nATM malware has evolved to include a number of different families and different actors\nbehind them, ranging from criminal groups to actors affiliated with nation states. The\nsignificance of ATM malware stems from the fact that it can bring significant financial\n\n\n-----\n\nbenefits to attackers and as a consequence cause a significant damage to targeted\nbanks, financial institutions and end users.\n\nNow that this type of malware has been around for more than 10 years, we wanted to\nround up the specific families we've seen during that time and attempt to find out if the\ndifferent families share any code.\n\n## ATM malware overview\n\n### Significance\n\nATM malware provided criminals with a subtler alternative to physically breaking into the\nsafe built into the ATM. Before the appearance of ATM malware, criminals typically had\nto employ traditional ways of robbing ATMs, often pulling the physical device out of the\nground or blowing it to pieces with dynamite. Obviously, these methods would quickly\ndraw the attention of law enforcement and passersby.\n\nOver the past 10 years, we have seen a steady increase in the number of ATM malware\nsamples discovered. Still, the number of discovered samples is very small compared to\nalmost any other malware category.\n\n_Number of ATM malware samples discovered year over year based on the year of first_\n_submission to VirusTotal._\n\nAs a digital substitute for dynamite, ATM malware allows criminals to employ money\nmules and instruct them how to dispense money from targeted ATMs. Typically, it\nhappens by supplying a special authorisation code or card created to authorise the\ntransaction.\n\nBefore that, criminals had to infect the targeted ATM to install the code, which more often\nthan not meant that they had to physically open the device to access its optical media\nreading devices or USB ports.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere have been many reported attacks on various banking organizations throughout\nthe world, but they seem to be more prevalent in Latin America and Eastern Europe,\nwhere the ATM infrastructure is older and are not regularly updated with security\nsoftware or tamper-proof sensors. The damage caused by ATM malware to banks and\nindividuals is rarely disclosed but it likely reaches millions of dollars a year.\n\nATM malware affects banks and other financial institutions, as well as the reputation of\nATM manufacturers and individuals and companies whose account details are stolen in\nATM malware attacks.\n\n### Classification\n\nThere are several different ways we can classify ATM malware families. Based on its\nfunctionality, we can classify ATM malware into virtual skimmers and cash dispensers.\nThe purpose of skimmers is to steal card and transaction details and individual PINs if\nthe encryption keys used by pin pad are successfully retrieved.\n\nCash-dispensing malware uses functions to allow for so-called \"jackpotting\" of ATMs\nwhere money is dispensed by attackers without the authorisation from the bank. But\nthere are malware families that can steal card details and dispense cash.\n\nAs far as the installation process is concerned, we again have two major groups. The\nfirst one requires the attacker to physically access the device. The second group\nassumes that the attacker installs malware indirectly, typically by compromising the\ninternal network of the bank and then targeting ATMs using stolen credentials.\n\nThese types of malware will also either target specific models of ATMs, or will be more\ngeneric. Recently, ATM malware typically deploys generic functions.\n\nThe most common framework is the CEN/XFS framework, which allows the developers\nof the ATM applications to compile and run their code regardless of the ATM model or\nthe manufacturer but there are others, such as Kalignite framework built on top of XFS.\n\nThe XFS API contains high-level functions for communicating with the various ATM\nmodules such as the cash dispensing module (CDM), PIN pad (EPP4) or printer. The\nhigh-level functions are provided through a generic SDK, while the lower level functions,\nsupplied through service providers, are developed by ATM manufacturers. The\narchitecture is quite similar to Win32 architecture where the developers use the highlevel API to communicate with the OS kernel and various device drivers provided by the\nmanufacturers of the individual hardware components.\n\n\n-----\n\n_High-level CEN/XFS architecture._\n\nMost ATM samples require physical access to the targeted ATM. ATMs are not typically\nconnected to the internet and communicate with bank's central systems through\nspecialized lines. However, most of the ATMs are connected to internal networks for their\nmaintenance and administration so the second, smaller group of ATM malware may be\nintroduced by compromising the internal network first. This technique requires a higher\nlevel of sophistication but potentially brings higher returns if successful.\n\nSome generic hacking tools, such as [Cobalt Strike, have reportedly been used for](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/multiple-cobalt-personality-disorder.html)\nattacking ATMs and the transaction systems. This method has been more commonly\nused by more advanced groups such as Carbanak, Cobalt Gang and Lazarus (Group\n77), whose Fastcash attack affects IBM AIX operating system, which is rarely targeted\nby malware.\n\n### Notable ATM malware families and their functionality\n\nOver the past 10 years, we have seen more than 30 different ATM malware families. In\nthis section, we will briefly describe some of the more notable ones.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Number of ATM malware samples per family._\n\n**Ploutus**\n\n[Ploutus is the malware family with the largest number of discovered samples. The](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/atm-malware-variants/ploutus)\nmajority of them having been reported in Mexico. Ploutus is a standard ATM-dispensing\nmalware. The attackers need to be able to access physical ports or a CD-ROM drive to\nbe able to boot from it and modify the ATM system image to install the malware.\n\nAttackers allegedly used newer Ploutus variants to attack some U.S.-based ATMs.\nPloutus.D communicates with the ATM using the multi-vendor [KAL Kalignite framework,](https://www.kal.com/en/kal-products)\nwhich allows it to work with ATMs from different vendors with minimal changes to its\ncode base.\n\n\n-----\n\n_One of the Ploutus variant's interface._\n\n**Skimer**\n\n[Skimer is one of the first ATM attacks, and bears all of the features of well-developed](http://blog.threatexpert.com/2009/03/effect-of-credit-crunch-on-backdoors.html)\nmalware. Skimer functions as a virtual skimming device that attempts to steal bank card\nnumbers and details of the account and owner details stored on the magnetic stripe\n[tracks 1 and 2. A recent review of its functionality also indicates that it may also attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card%23Financial_cards)\nto steal users' PINs by retrieving the encrypted pin pad encryption keys from the system.\n\nApart from the virtual skimming function, Skimer acts as a backdoor to the ATM\nfunctionality for its operators — money mules employed to collect stolen data and\ndispense cash.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Main code loop for servicing Skimer's operators with cash._\n\nIf the user knows the secret code to activate the backdoor, the malware displays a\nmenu, which allows the operator to empty one of the four cash-dispensing modules\n(CDMs).\n\n_The code locking the dispenser module and dispensing cash._\n\nMost of the other ATM malware families follow a similar principle. The attackers need to\nbe able to physically access the ATM, which requires a key or drilling a hole to access\nspecific ports or devices. Once the malware is deployed, the money mules need a\nspecific code to access the menu and dispense cash.\n\n**Tyupkin (Padpin)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most interesting characteristic of [Tyupkin is that it has the ability to limit its operation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/01/07/atm-hacking-arrests-tyupkin/)\nto specific hours and days of the week. It was reported that some Tyupkin instances can\nonly be used on Sundays and Mondays at night.\n\n_Tyupkin function for checking the hours of operation._\n\nBefore dispensing cash, Tyupkin disables any network connections, presumably to\nprevent administrators from shutting down the ATM if a suspicious activity is detected.\n\nSome members of Tyupkin family are developed using C# and the .NET framework and\nsome using Microsoft Visual C++. The family uses XFS API to manage infected ATMs\nand dispense cash in multiple currencies. Tyupkin has been active since 2014 and the\nassociated gangs reportedly target Eastern European countries.\n\n**Alice**\n\n[Alice follows a similar pattern to other ATM malware. It is installed by attackers and](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/atm-malware-variants/alice)\nrequires physical access to the system. When the operator launches it, Alice displays a\nwindow requiring a PIN.\n\n_First Alice screen._\n\nIf the code is correct, Alice will access the dispenser module and allow the operator to\nretrieve cash.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Main Alice UI window._\n\n**Cutlet**\n\n[Cutlet, or Cutlet Maker, has been sold as a do-it-yourself ATM malware kit on some](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/atm-malware-variants/cutletmaker)\nunderground markets since 2016. The bundle contains detailed instructions in Russian\nand English on how to infect systems and how to acquire codes required to dispense\ncash.\n\n_Main Cutlet Maker user interface._\n\nThe Cutlet manual details operational security practices required to avoid being caught\nby law enforcement officers and shows where to drill holes in the ATM enclosure in order\nto access USB ports of a specific ATM model. The kit also contains a testing application\nnamed \"Stimulator\" for users to practice before they decide to conduct real attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nCutlet follows a similar pattern to the previous ATM malware. The owner of the kit has\nthe ability to generate codes per ATM required for its operation.\n\n**Fastcash**\nThe significance of [Fastcash malware is its mode of operation and its targeting of IBM](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A)\nAIX operating system. [Fastcash consists of a process injector and shared objects](https://github.com/fboldewin/FastCashMalwareDissected/blob/master/Operation%2520Fast%2520Cash%2520-%2520Hidden%2520Cobra%25E2%2580%2598s%2520AIX%2520PowerPC%2520malware%2520dissected.pdf)\npresumably injected into the process space of compromised bank payment authorization\nsystems. The malware monitors [ISO8583-based transactions using code from a fairly old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583)\nopen-source [library for parsing ISO8583 packets.](https://github.com/sabit/Oscar-ISO8583)\n\nIf an ATM transaction contains the attackers' codes, the data will not be forwarded to the\noriginal payment authorisation application and the transaction approval will be sent back\nto the target ATM system allowing attackers to dispense cash.\n\nThis mode of operation is similar to some rootkits, where malware attempts to hide its\npresence on the system by modifying the responses sent back from the operating\nsystem to the application that attempts to list system objects such as files or processes.\nThe returned list is usually modified to remove names of processes that belong to the\nmalware.\n\nFastcash has been attributed to the Lazarus Group and it is an example of a nationstate-related actor targeting financial systems for the attacker's financial benefit.\nFastcash shows a level of sophistication and knowledge that is not seen in other, run-ofthe-mill, ATM malware.\n\n### Code sharing between families\n\nThanks to [Xylitol and the](https://twitter.com/Xylit0l) [ATM Cybercrime tracker, it was easy to retrieve a fairly](http://atm.cybercrime-tracker.net/)\ncomplete ATM malware data set, with the addition of the few files connected with the\nFastcash campaign.\n\nThe data set contains 121 files and it is well suited for analysis and clustering. Out of\n121 files, there are 114 PE files and those were used for clustering using the static\nanalysis techniques. Out of 114 PE files there were 37 packed files which may not be\nsuitable for static analysis techniques and 20 DLLs.\n\nWhile investigating various methods for clustering, we stumbled upon an interesting\n[book, \"Malware Data Science\" by Joshua Saxe and Hillary Sanders. This book shows](https://www.malwaredatascience.com/)\nbasic and more advanced methods for classifying and clustering malicious files and used\nsome of the ideas to cluster our own set.\n\nIn our case, the clustering was conducted by extracting the following attributes of each\nsample:\n\nStrings extracted from the file\nDisassembled code from the entry point of the file\nFile entropy and the presence of a known packer\nImported or exported functions\nEmbedded resources\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter collecting the attributes from each sample, Jaccard distance is calculated for every\npair of the files in the set. The Jaccard index is a measure of similarity between two sets.\nThe more similar the two samples are, the higher their Jaccard index will be. The index\nis a number between 0 and 1. For example, the Jaccard index of 0.5 indicates 50\npercent overlap between the two sets.\n\n_Clusters with Jaccard index threshold of 0.7._\n\nWe need to set the threshold required for two samples to be connected as a part of a\nsingle cluster. The higher the Jaccard threshold we choose, the more related will be the\nmembers of the defined cluster. By varying the threshold we come to the optimal value\nfor our purpose. For example, for correct classification of samples we should choose the\nvalue higher than 0.7, and for code sharing purposes, higher than 0.3.\n\nAs expected, the results show that as we lower the thresholds we see more clusters\nappear and some of the clusters show overlap between distinct ATM malware families.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Clusters with Jaccard index threshold of 0.3._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe width of the lines in the graph show how strongly the files in the clusters are related.\nFor example, we see that the members of individual GreenDispenser, Tyupkin or\nDispCash clusters are very closely related, while mixed Ligsterac/Skimer,\nTyupkin/Dispcash and ATMtest/Helloworld clusters show weaker connections that likely\nindicate some overlap in the malware code.\n\n## Protection and detection best practices\n\nWhen considering protection and detection of attacks with ATM malware, it is important\nto consider the physical security of ATMs, the security of software running on the system\nand the security of any segment of the organization's network that communicates with\nATMs.\n\nHere are 15 best practices that organizations should follow when considering protection\nof ATMs networks and successful and timely detection of attacks when they happen.\n\nEnsure ATMs and all related systems run up-to-date software and the latest\noperating system versions with the latest security patches applied.\nDisable Windows AutoPlay and configure BIOS to disable the ability to boot\nsoftware from USB sticks and CD/DVD drives. Set strong BIOS password\nprotection to prevent boot settings from being changed.\nDisable access to the Windows desktop at the ATM, ensure RDP sessions are\nsecured with multiple authentication factors such as Duo Authentication for\nWindows Logon and RDP.\nRemove any unused services and applications from the system to reduce the\nattack surface. Implement other measures to harden the underlying ATM operating\nsystem.\nMonitor the operation of ATMs, as well as their physical integrity. Look for unusual\npatterns of resets, communication failures and transaction volume.\nImplement strong encryption between the ATM and the host.\nEnsure access to the ATM cabinet is restricted to authorized persons and that\nsuch access is electronically logged.\nPerform a security assessment of ATMs, including their physical locations and any\nnetworks connecting to them.\nEnsure that firewalls and anti-malware protection are correctly configured.\nConfigure whitelisting solutions or operating system features to allow only known,\ntrusted software to run. Make sure that whitelisting cannot be disabled without\ngenerating a remote log entry.\nPrevent unauthorized USB devices from being installed using a device control\nfunction.\nEducate employees about how they can avoid introducing malware into\noperational systems.\nMaintain a physically and logically segmented network environment throughout the\norganization using segmentation technology such as [Cisco TrustSec.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/trustsec/index.html)\nEnsure visibility over network traffic to ATM systems and payment authorisation\nservers using technology that enhance network visibility, such as Cisco\nStealthwatch.\n\n\n-----\n\nMonitor threat intelligence feeds to learn about newly detected ATM malware\nthreats.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nATM malware is a niche area attacks, but it potentially brings significant benefits to\nactors that successfully manage to deploy it. Over 10 years since the discovery of the\nfirst specialized malicious code targeting the Diebold Agilis line of ATMs, we have seen\nover 30 other malware families with varying degrees of sophistication, complexity and\nsuccess. Most of the successful attacks are reported in countries where the ATMs are\nolder, such as some Latin American countries and Eastern Europe.\n\nWhile the majority of actors behind ATM malware seem to be less sophisticated criminal\nactors, the potential of being able to dispense large amounts of cash also attracts more\nsophisticated criminal groups such as Carbanak and Cobalt Gang, as well as some\nstate-sponsored actors such as Lazarus.\n\nAlthough the number of known malware samples for ATMs has been very low there has\nbeen a steady increase in the trendline for number of discovered samples year over\nyear.\n\nFinancial organizations and banks have to be particularly vigilant when considering\nprotection against malware for ATMs and payment systems. Enterprises and individuals\nmay also experience financial loss due to potential of their card details being used for\nillegal transactions after being skimmed by ATM malware. Best practices should be\nfollowed to ensure the highest possible level of protection and organizations should\ninvest into increasing user awareness about the dangers of ATM malware.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block these threats are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection](http://cs.co/reviewamp)\n[(AMP) is ideally suited to prevent](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nthe execution of the malware used\nby these threat actors.
