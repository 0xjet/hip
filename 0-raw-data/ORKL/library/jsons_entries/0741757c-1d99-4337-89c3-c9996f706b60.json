This can occur after the release is published, and without notification or\naudit logging accessible in the UI to either the project owners or the public. However, some\naudit information may be available via the GitHub APIs. An attacker can compromise a\ncollaborator’s account and use it to modify releases without the knowledge of project owners\nor the public, thus resulting in supply chain attacks against the users of the project.\n\nThis issue was reported to the vendor – their response is that this is intended behavior and is\nan intentional design decision. While the vendor is planning improvements in this area, they\nare not able to provide additional details. GitHub.com paid plans and the GitHub enterprise\nserver were not tested.\n\nAs a mitigation measure, project owners using GitHub.com are encouraged to use other\nmethods for securing releases such as digitally signing releases with PGP. Users are\nencouraged to check digital signatures and use the GitHub.com release APIs to extract and\nverify release assets data.\n\n## Background\n\n**[GitHub.com is a widely used tool for software development offering source code](https://github.com/)**\nmanagement (SCM) and other tools. It is used for hosting and distribution by many open\nsource projects (OSS). The release functionality within GitHub.com offers a way to publish\npackaged software iterations as releases. These include a compressed snapshot of the\nsource within the project as a .ZIP and .TAR.GZ file, as well as as additional binary assets.\nThis functionality is a common way for open source projects to distribute their releases.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\nThe release functionality on GitHub.com allows modification of assets within a release by\nany project collaborator, after the initial release is published. An attacker can use this gap to\nmodify releases without the knowledge of project owners by compromising an account of any\nproject collaborator, thus resulting in supply chain attacks against those using the project.\nThe following specific issues facilitate this:\n\n**Release assets can be modified after initial publication – except for the source**\ncode snapshots\n\n\n-----\n\n**Any project collaborator can modify a release – there are no fine-grained controls to**\nallow code access and not release access.\n**There is no notification or indication within the UI that a release was modified –**\nto either the project owners or other collaborators, or the public. However, some data is\nexposed via API.\n**A “verified” flag is displayed if the Git commit was verified – but this only applies**\nto the source code snapshot and not the other release assets\n\n[The releases API provided by GitHub does expose additional information about release](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#releases)\nassets, which could potentially be used to see if a release was modified. This information\nincludes the username of the uploader and the timestamp when the upload took place. This\ncan be compared to the main release metadata. An example of using APIs for checking\n[releases can be found at our release_auditor project.](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/release_auditor)\n\n**NOTE: Paid GitHub.com plans and the GitHub enterprise server were not tested.**\n\n[Example of a release (see here):](https://github.com/nightwatchcyber/gh_release_test/releases/tag/0.1)\n\n[Example of API response exposing asset data:](https://api.github.com/repos/nightwatchcyber/gh_release_test/releases/41605278)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Steps to Replicate\n\nThe following steps can be used to replicate this issue:\n\n1. Alice creates a public repository on GitHub.com, and adds some code including a shell\n\nscript “test.sh”.\n2. Alice invites Bob as a collaborator on this repository.\n3 Alice publishes a release including the shell script “test sh” as a separate asset\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Bob accesses the release, and modifies the test.sh script within the release.\n5. When viewing the release via GitHub.com UI, there is no indication the script was\n\nmodified. Downloading the script shows that it is different from what Alice published.\n\n**NOTE: Paid GitHub.com plans and the GitHub enterprise server were not tested.**\n\n## Vendor Response and Mitigation\n\nThe issue was reported to the vendor via their bounty program. Their response is that this\n**is intended behavior and is an intentional design decision. While the vendor is**\n**planning improvements in this area, they are not able to provide additional details.**\n\nGitHub.com paid plans and the GitHub enterprise server were not tested.\n\nAs a mitigation measure, project owners using GitHub.com are encouraged to use other\nmethods for securing releases such as digitally signing releases with PGP. Users are\nencouraged to check digital signatures and use the GitHub.com release APIs to extract and\nverify release assets data.\n\n[An example of using APIs to check releases can be found in our release_auditor project.](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/release_auditor)\n\n## References\n\n[Example repository: https://github.com/nightwatchcyber/gh_release_test](https://github.com/nightwatchcyber/gh_release_test)\nGitHub.com docs: [here,](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases) [here and](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#releases)\nHackerOne report # 1167780\n[release_auditor: see here](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/release_auditor)\n\n## Credits\n\nAdvisory written by Y.
