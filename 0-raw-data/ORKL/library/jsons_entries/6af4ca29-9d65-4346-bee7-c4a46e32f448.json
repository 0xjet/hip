Not only do U.S. officials not disclose it, neither do most private threat\nintelligence firms (insofar as they have insight), for reasons of patriotism, pedigree and\nprofit.\n\n**Generally, only foreign-owned private cyber firms like the Russia-based Kaspersky, the**\n[object of deep distrust by U.S. intelligence officials, have treated U.S. threat actors like](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2019/09/us-finalizes-rule-banning-kaspersky-products-government-contracts/159742/)\nothers: by naming them, describing their targets, and detailing their tactics, techniques and\nprocedures.\n\n**Between the lines: The greater visibility, and heated rhetoric, surrounding cyber operations**\ntargeting the U.S. leads to more ink being spilled on the subject, which, in an escalatory\nspiral, further raises the public temperature.\n\nMany within the halls of government — including in Congress, where most lawmakers\nare not regularly privy to classified information regarding U.S. government hacking —\nare also taking their cues from public reporting.\nThat means U.S. officials are themselves absorbing, and then often further amplifying,\nthis distorted view.\n\n**Even when officials do acknowledge American cyber spying, it's often in coded language**\nor to describe a specific subset of U.S. actions.\n\nOfficials will talk of \"defending forward\" — that is, U.S. activity meant to raise the costs\nfor adversaries to be successful in cyberspace — rather than speaking clearly and\nfrankly about cyber espionage for traditional intelligence collection purposes.\n\n**Yes, but: \"Russia launched SolarWinds — the latest in a long series of hostile Russian cyber**\noperations — not because the U.S. has engaged too proactively in cyberspace,\" Gary Corn,\na former senior Cyber Command official, [wrote in Lawfare. \"Quite the opposite; it did so, very](https://www.lawfareblog.com/solarwinds-bad-retreat-defend-forward-would-be-worse)\nsimply, because it could.\"\n\nThe U.S.' own cyber operations neither explains nor justifies the actions or motivations\nof America’s adversaries. But a clearer public understanding of what the U.S. does in\ncyberspace would mean a clearer understanding of what other countries are up to.\n\n**The most measured reactions to SolarWinds have therefore often come from top U.S.**\nintelligence officials, who know too much about the country’s own activities to pretend\notherwise.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo while lawmakers like Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) compared\nSolarWinds to a Russian act of war, current and former intel officials were more muted.\n\n**\"Good on them, bad on us,\"** [said former acting CIA director Michael Morell to news of the](https://twitter.com/margbrennan/status/1351974835874914307?s=20)\nRussian hack. Morell emphasized that SolarWinds appears to have \"just\" been espionage\nand not, apparently, some type of prelude to destruction.\n\nPaul Kolbe, a former senior CIA official, decried the “indignant howling” over\n[SolarWinds in a provocative and clear-eyed essay in the New York Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/opinion/russia-united-states-hack.html)\nIn [a statement about the hack, CISA, FBI, NSA and ODNI also underlined their](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/01/05/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure)\nassessment that SolarWinds “was, and continues to be, an intelligence gathering\neffort.”\n\n**The bottom line: The question isn’t whether U.S. cyber operators are, for example, targeting**\nmajor Russian government agencies, but how successful these ventures have been and\ncontinue to be.\n\n\n-----",
