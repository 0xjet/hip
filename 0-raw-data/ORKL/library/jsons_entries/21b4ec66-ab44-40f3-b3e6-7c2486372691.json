Cyber attackers used living off](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/banking-trojan-delivered-by-lolbins-ramnit-trojan)\nthe land binaries (LOLbins) to hide their malicious activity and operate stealthily in target\nsystems. Using native, legitimate operating system tools, attackers were able to infiltrate and\ngain remote access to devices without any malware. For organizations with limited visibility\ninto their environment, this type of attack can be fatal.\n\nIn this research, we explain one of the most recent and unique campaigns involving the\n**Astaroth trojan. This Trojan and information stealer was recognized in Europe**\nand chiefly affected Brazil through the abuse of native OS processes and the exploitation of\nsecurity-related products.\n\n_[Pervasive Brazilian Financial Malware Targets Bank Customers in Latin America and Europe](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/brazilian-financial-malware-banking-europe-south-america)_\n\nThe [Cybereason Platform was able to detect this new variant of the Astaroth Trojan in a](https://www.cybereason.com/deep-detect-and-respond)\nmassive spam campaign that targeted Brazil and parts of Europe. Our Active Hunting\nService team was able to analyze the campaign and identify that it maliciously took\n[advantage of legitimate tools like the BITSAdmin utility and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/bits/bitsadmin-tool) [the WMIC utility to interact with a](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/wmisdk/wmic)\nC2 server and download a payload. It was also able to use a component of multinational\n[antivirus software Avast to gain information about the target system, as well as a process](https://www.avast.com/en-us/index#mac)\n[belonging to Brazilian information security company GAS Tecnologia to gather personal](https://www.bnamericas.com/company-profile/en/gas-tecnologia-gas)\ninformation. With a sophisticated attack such as this, it is critical for your security team to\nhave a clear understanding of your environment so they can swiftly detect malicious activity\nand respond effectively.\n\n## Unique Aspects to this Latest Version of the Astaroth Trojan Campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Astaroth Trojan campaign is a phishing-based campaign that gained momentum\ntowards the end of 2018 and was identified in thousands of incidents. Early versions differed\nsignificantly from later versions as the adversaries advanced and optimized their attack. This\nversion contrasted significantly from previous versions in four key ways.\n\n1. This version maliciously used BITSAdmin to download the attackers payload. This\n\n[differed from early versions of the campaign that used certutil.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil)\n2. This version injects a malicious module into one of Avast's processes, whereas early\n\nversions of the campaign detected Avast and quit. As Avast is the most common\nantivirus software in the world, this is an effective evasive strategy.\n3. This version of the campaign made malicious use of unins000.exe, a process that\n\nbelongs to the Brazilian information security company GAS Tecnologia, to gather\npersonal information undetected. This trusted process is prevalent on Brazilian\nmachines. To the best of our knowledge, no other versions of the malware used this\nprocess.\n\n4. This version used a fromCharCode() deobfuscation method to avoid explicitly writing\n\nexecution commands and help hide the code it is initiating. Earlier versions did not use\nthis method.\n\n## A Breakdown of the Latest Astaroth Trojan Spam Campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nAs with many traditional spam campaigns, this campaign begins with a .7zip file. This file\ngets downloaded to a user machine through a mail attachment or a mistakenly-pressed\nhyperlink.\n\nThe downloaded .7zip file contains a .lnk file that, once pressed, initializes the malware.\n\n_The .lnk file extracted from the .7zip file._\n\nAn obfuscated command is located inside the Target bar in the .lnk file properties.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hidden command inside the .lnk file._\n\n\n-----\n\n_The full obfuscated command inside the .lnk file._\n\nWhen the .lnk file is initialized, it spawns a CMD process. This process executes a command\n[to maliciously use the legitimate wmic.exe to initialize an XSL Script Processing (MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1220/)\nTechnique T1220) attack. The attack executes embedded JScript or VBScript in an XSL\nstylesheet located on a remote domain (qnccmvbrh.wilstonbrwsaq[.]pw).\n\nwmic.exe is a powerful, native Windows command line utility used to interact with Windows\n[Management Instrumentation (WMI). This utility is able to execute complicated WQL queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/wmisdk/querying-with-wql)\n[and WMI methods. It is often used by attackers for](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/wmisdk/calling-a-wmi-method) lateral movement, reconnaissance, and\nbasic code invocation. By using a trusted, native utility, the attackers can hide the scope of\nthe full attack and evade detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The initial attack vector as detected by the Cybereason Platform._\n\nwmic.exe creates a .txt file with information about the domain that stores the remote XSL\nscript. It identifies the location of the infected machine, including country, city, and other\ninformation. Once this information is gathered, it sends location data about the infected\nmachine to the remote XSL script.\n\nThis location data gives the attacker a unique edge, as they can specify a target country or\ncity to attack and maximize their accuracy when choosing a particular target.\n\n_The .txt file contains information about the C2 domain and infected machine, as detected in a_\n_Cybereason Lab environment._\n\n## Phase one: An Analysis of the Remote XSL\n\n\n-----\n\nThe remote XSL script that wmic.exe sends information to contains highly obfuscated JScript\ncode that will execute additional steps of the malicious activity. The code is obfuscated in\norder to hide any malicious activity on the remote server.\n\nInitially, the XSL script defines several variables for command execution and data storage. It\n[also creates several ActiveX objects. The majority of ActiveX Objects created with](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms221401(v=vs.85).aspx)\n**Wscript.Shell and Shell.Application are used to run programs, create shortcuts,**\nmanipulate the contents of the registry, or access system folders. These variables are used\nto invoke legitimate Windows OS processes for malicious activities, and serve as a bridge\nbetween the remote domain that stores the script and the infected machine.\n\n_Malicious script variables._\n\n### Obfuscation Mechanism for the JScript Code\n\nThe malicious JScript code obfuscation relies on two main techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The script uses the function [fromCharCode() that returns a string created from a](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode)\n\nsequence of UTF-16 code units. By using this function, it avoids explicitly writing\ncommands it wants to execute and it hides the actual code it is initiating. In particular,\nthe script uses this function to hide information related to process names. To the best of\nour knowledge, this method was not used in early versions of the spam campaign.\n\n2. The script uses the function radador(), which returns a randomized integer. This\n\nfunction is able to obfuscate code so that every iteration of the code is presented\ndifferently. In contrast to the first method of obfuscation, this has been used effectively\nsince early versions of the Astaroth Trojan campaign.\n\n_String.fromCharCode() usage in the XSL script._\n\n\n-----\n\n_The random number generator function radador()._\n\nThese two obfuscation techniques are used to bypass antivirus defenses and make security\nresearcher investigations more challenging.\n\n### Choosing a C2 Server\n\nThe XSL script contains variable xparis() that holds the C2 domain the malicious files will be\ndownloaded from. In order to extend the lifespan of the domains in case one or more are\nblacklisted, there are twelve different C2 domains that xparis() can be set to. In order to\ndecide which domain xparis() holds, a variable pingadori() uses the radador() function to\nrandomize the domain. pingadori() is a random integer between one and twelve, which\ndecides which domain xparis() is assigned.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The C2 domain selection mechanism._\n\nOne of the most used functions in the XSL script is Bxaki(). Bxaki() takes a URL and a file as\narguments. It downloads the file to the infected machine from the input URL using\nBITSAdmin, and is called every time the script attempts to download a file.\n\nIn previous iterations, the Astaroth Trojan campaign used cerutil to download files. In order to\nhide this process, it was renamed certis. In this iteration, they have replaced certutil with\nBITSAdmin.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Bxaki obfuscated function._\n\n_deobfuscated function._\n\n\n_Bxaki_\n\n\nIn order to gain access to the infected computer’s file system, the XSL script uses the\nvariable fso with FileSystemObject capabilities. This variable is created using an ActiveX\nobject. The XSL script contains additional hard coded variables sVarRaz and sVar2RazX,\nwhich contain file paths that direct to the downloaded files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The file’s path._\n\n_The directory creation._\n\n### Downloading the Payloads\n\nThe remote XSL script downloads twelve files from the C2 server that masquerade\nthemselves as JPEG, GIF, and extensionless files. These files are downloaded to a directory\n_(C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\tempsys) on the infected machine by Bxaki() and xparis(). Within_\nthese twelve files are the Astaroth Trojan modules, several additional files the Trojan may\nuse to extend its capabilities, and an r1.log file. The r1.log file stores information for\nexfiltration. A thorough explanation of what information is collected can be found in a\n[breakdown by Cofense from late 2018.](https://cofense.com/seeing-resurgence-demonic-astaroth-wmic-trojan/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_The script verifies all parts of the malware have been downloaded._\n\nAfter downloading the payload, the XSL script checks to make sure every piece of the\nmalware was downloaded.\n\n_One of the twelve download commands as detected by the Cybereason platform in same_\n_variant of Astaroth._\n\n\n-----\n\n_The twelve downloaded files._\n\n### Detecting Avast\n\nA unique feature of this latest Astaroth Trojan campaign is the malware's ability to search for\nspecific security products and exploit them.\n\nIn earlier variants, upon detecting Avast, the XSL script would simply quit. Instead, it now\nuses Avast to execute malicious actions.\n\nSimilar to earlier versions of the Astaroth Trojan campaign, the XSL script searches for Avast\non the infected machine, and specifically targets a certain process of Avast aswrundll.exe. It\nuses three variables stem1, stem2, and stem3 that, when combined, form a specific path\n_(C:\\Program Files\\AVAST Software\\AVAST\\aswRunDll.exe) to aswRundll.exe. It obfuscates_\nthis path using the fromCharCode() function.\n\n**aswrundll.exe is the Avast Software Runtime Dynamic Link Library that is responsible for**\nrunning modules for Avast. If aswrundll.exe exists at this path, Avast exists on the machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Note: aswrundll.exe is very similar to Microsoft s own rundll32.exe - it allows you to execute**\nDLLs by calling their exported functions. The use of aswrundll.exe as a LOLbin has been\nmentioned in the past year.\n\n_Stem variables presented as unicode strings._\n\n_Stem variables decoded to ASCII._\n\n### Manipulating Avast\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the XSL script has identified that Avast is installed on the machine, it loads a malicious\nmodule Irdsnhrxxxfery64 from its location on disk. In order to load this module, it uses an\nActiveX Object ShA created with Shell.Application capabilities. The object uses\n[ShellExecute() to create an aswrundll.exe process instance and loads Irdsnhrxxxfery64. It](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/shell/shell-shellexecute)\nloads the module with parameter vShow set to zero, which opens the application with a\nhidden window.\n\nAlternatively, if Avast is not installed on the machine, the malicious module loads using\n**regsvr32.exe. regsvr32.exe is a native Windows utility for registering and unregistering**\nDLLs and ActiveX controls in the Windows registry.\n\n_The script attempts to load the malicious module using regsvr with the run function._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Procmon shows the malicious module loaded to the Avast process._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Procmon shows the malicious module loaded using the regsvr32.exe process._\n\n## Phase two: Payload Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nThe only module the XSL script loads is Irdsnhrxxxfery64, which is packed using the UPX\npacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Information pertaining to lrdsnhxxfery64.~._\n\nAfter unpacking the module, it is packed with an additional inner packer\n**Pe123\\RPolyCryptor. This module has to be investigated in a dynamic way to fully**\nunderstand the malware and the role the module played during execution.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Information pertaining to lrdsnhrxxfery64_Unpacked.dll._\n\nThroughout the malware execution, Irdsnhrxxxfery64.~ acts as the main malware\ncontroller. The module initiates the malicious activity once the payload download is complete.\nIt executes the other modules and collects initial information about the machine, including\ninformation about the network, locale, and the keyboard language.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The main module collecting information about the machine._\n\n**Continuing Malicious Activity and Manipulating Additional Security Products**\n\nAfter the module loads with regsvr32.exe, the Irdsnhrxxxfery64 module injects another\nmodule Irdsnhrxxxfery98, which was downloaded by the script into regsvr32.exe using the\n[LoadLibraryExW() function.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryexa)\n\nSimilar to the previous case, if Avast and aswrundll.exe are on the machine,\n**Irdsnhrxxxfery98 will be injected into that process instead of regsvr32.exe.**\n\n_Irdsnhrxxxfery64 injecting lrdsnhrxxfery98._\n\n\n-----\n\n_The malicious modules in regsvr32.exe memory_\n\nAfter the Irdsnhrxxxfery98 module is loaded, the malware searches different processes to\ncontinue its malicious activity depending on the way Irdsnhrxxxfery64 was loaded.\n\n1. If Irdsnhrxxxfery64 is loaded using aswrundll.exe, the module will continue to target\n\n**aswrundll.exe. It will create new instances and continue to inject malicious content to**\nit.\n2. If Irdsnhrxxxfery64 is loaded using regsvr32.exe, it will target three processes:\n\nIt will target unins000.exe if it is available. unins000.exe is a process developed by\nGAS Tecnologia that is common on Brazilian machines.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf unins000.exe does not exist, it will target Syswow64\\userinit.exe. userinit.exe is a\nnative Windows process that specifies the program that Winlogon runs when a user\nlogs on to their computer. Similarly, if unins000.exe and Syswow64\\userinit.exe do not\nexist, it will target System32\\userinit.exe.\n\n_The malware searches for targeted processes._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Irdsnhrxxxfery64 manipulation on userinit.exe & unins000.exe_\n\n**Injection Technique To Increase Stealthiness**\n\nAfter locating one of the target processes, the malware uses Process Hollowing (MITRE\nTechnique T1093) to evasively create a new process from a legitimate source. This new\nprocess is in a suspended state so the malware can unmap its memory and write its contents\nto the new, allocated space. Once this is complete, it will resume the suspended process. By\nusing this technique, the malware is able to leverage itself from a signed and verified\nlegitimate Windows OS process, or, alternatively, if aswrundll.exe or unins000.exe exists, a\nsigned and verified security product process.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Astaroth module creates a process in a suspended state (dwCreationFlags set to 4)._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Unmapping process memory._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Writing content and resuming the process._\n\nThe Cybereason platform was able to detect the malicious injection, identifying\n**Irdsnhrxxxfery64.~, Irdsnhrxxxfery98.~, and module arqueiro.**\n\n\n-----\n\n_The downloaded modules found in regsvr32.exe as detected by the Cybereason platform._\n\n### Data Exfiltration\n\nThe second module Irdsnhrxxxfery98.~ is responsible for a vast amount of information\nstealing, and is able to collect information through hooking, clipboard usage, and monitoring\nthe keystate.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Irdsnhrxxxfery98 information collecting capabilities._\n\nIn addition to its own information stealing capabilities, the Astaroth Trojan campaign also\n[uses an external feature NetPass. NetPass is one of the downloaded payload files renamed](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/network_password_recovery.html)\nto lrdsnhrxxferyb.jpg.\n\n[NetPass is a free network password recovery tool that, according to its developer Nirsoft,](https://www.nirsoft.net/)\ncan recover passwords including:\n\nLogin passwords of remote computers on LAN.\nPasswords of mail accounts on an exchange server stored by Microsoft Outlook.\nPasswords of MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger accounts.\nInternet Explorer 7.x and 8.x passwords from password-protected web sites that\ninclude Basic Authentication or Digest Access Authentication.\nThe item name of Internet Explorer 7 passwords that always begin with\n**Microsoft_WinInet prefix.**\n\nThe passwords stored by Remote Desktop 6.\n\n_NetPass usage._\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attack Flow and Exfiltration\n\nAfter injecting into the targeted processes, the modules continue their malicious activity\nthrough those processes. The malware executes malicious activity in a small period of time\nthrough the target process, deletes itself, and then repeats. This occurs periodically and is\npersistent.\n\n_The malware’s_\n\n_different functionality._\n\nOnce the targeted processes are infected by the malicious modules, they begin\ncommunicating with the payload C2 server and exfiltrating information saved to the r1.log\nfile. The communication and exfiltration of data was detected in a real-world scenario using\nthe Cybereason platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The malicious use of GAS Tecnologia security process unins000.exe._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Data exfiltration from unins000.exe to a malicious IP._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur Active Hunting Service was able to detect both the malicious use of the BITSAdmin\nutility and the WMIC utility. Our customer immediately stopped the attack using the\nremediation section of our platform and prevented any exfiltration of data. From there, our\nhunting team identified the rest of the attack and completed a thorough analysis.\n\nWe were able to detect and evaluate an evasive infection technique used to spread a variant\nof the Astaroth Trojan as part of a large, Brazilian-based spam campaign. In our discovery,\nwe highlighted the use of legitimate, built-in Windows OS processes used to perform\nmalicious activities to deliver a payload without being detected, as well as how the Astaroth\nTrojan operates and installs multiple modules covertly. We also showed its use of well-known\ntools and antivirus products to expand its capabilities. The analysis of the tools and\ntechniques used in the Astaroth campaign show how truly effective LOLbins are at evading\nantivirus products. As we enter 2019, we anticipate that the use of LOLbins will likely\nincrease. Because of the great potential for malicious exploitation inherent in the use of\nnative processes, it is very likely that many other information stealers will adopt this method\nto deliver their payload into targeted machines.\n\nAs a result of this detection, the customer was able to contain an advanced attack before any\ndamage was done. The Astaroth Trojan was controlled, WMIC was disabled, and the attack\nwas halted in its tracks.\n\nPart of the difficulty identifying this attack is in how it evades detection. It is difficult to catch,\neven for security teams aware of the complications ensuring a secure system, as with our\ncustomer above. LOLbins are deceptive because their execution seems benign at first, or\n\n\n-----\n\neven sometimes safe, as with the malicious use of antivirus software. As the use of LOLbins\nbecomes more commonplace, we suspect this complex method of attack will become more\ncommon as well. The potential for damage will grow as attackers will look to other more\ndestructive payloads.\n\n_For more information on LOLbins in the wild, read our research into a different Trojan._\n\n## Indicators of CompromisE\n\n\n**SHA1**\n\n01782747C12Bf06A52704A144DB59FEC41B3CB36\n\n**SHA1**\n\n1F83403398964D4E8B6C70B171C51CD278909172\n\n**SHA1**\n\nCE8BDB56CCAC55C6881701EBD39DA316EE7ED18D\n\n**SHA1**\n\n926137A50f473BBD257CD19E207C1C9114F6B215\n\n**SHA1**\n\n5579E03EB1DA076EF939196CB14F8B769F30A302\n\n**SHA1**\n\nB2734835888756929EE3FF4DCDE85080CB299D2A\n\n**SHA1**\n\n206352E13D601239E2D043D971EA6657C091071A\n\n**SHA1**\n\nEAE82A63A980998F8D388BCCE7D967F28309F593\n\n\nHash NF-e513468.zip\n\nHash Script.js\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxfery64.~\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxfery98.~\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferyb.jpg\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferyc.jpg\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferydwwn.gif\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferydwwn.gif\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA1**\n\n9CD5A399C9320CBFB87C9D1CAD3BC366FB12E54F\n\n**SHA1**\n\n206352E13D601239E2D043D971EA6657C091071A\n\n**SHA1**\n\n4CDE9A53A9A49D606BC89E74D47398A69E767056\n\n**SHA1**\n\nF99319B1B321AE9F2D1F0361BC756A43D25444CE\n\n**SHA1**\n\nB85C106B68ED410107f97A2CC38b7EC05353F1FA\n\n**SHA1**\n\n77809236FDF621ABE37B32BF073B0B893E9CE67A\n\n**SHA1**\n\nB85C106B68ED410107f97A2CC38b7EC05353F1fA\n\n**SHA1**\n\nC2F3350AC58DE900768032554C009C4A78C47CCC\n\n104.129.204[.]41\n\n63.251.126[.]7\n\n195.157.15[.]100\n\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferydx.gif\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferye.jpg\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferyg.gif\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferygx.gif\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferyxa.~\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferyxb.~\n\nHash lrdsnhrxxferyxa.~\n\nHash r1.log\n\nIP C2\n\nIP C2\n\nIP C2\n\n\n-----\n\n173.231.184[.]59\n\n64.95.103[.]181\n\n19analiticsx00220a[.]com\n\nqnccmvbrh.wilstonbrwsaq[.]pw\n\nAbout the Author\n\n**Cybereason Nocturnus**\n\n\nIP C2\n\nIP C2\n\nDomain C2\n\nDomain C2\n\n\nThe Cybereason Nocturnus Team has brought the world’s brightest minds from the military,\ngovernment intelligence, and enterprise security to uncover emerging threats across the\nglobe.
