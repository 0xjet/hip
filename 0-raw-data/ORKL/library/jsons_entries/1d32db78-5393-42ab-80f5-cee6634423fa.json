In the case of Wannacry,\n\nGoogle’s Neel Mehta was able to identify a code fragment which became\n\nthe most important clue in the story, and was later confirmed by further\n\n[evidence, showing Wannacry as a pet project of the Lazarus group.](https://securelist.com/wannacry-and-lazarus-group-the-missing-link/78431/)\n\nTo date, nobody has been able to find any significant code sharing\n\nbetween ExPetr/Petya and older malware. Given our love for unsolved\n\nmysteries, we jumped right on it.\n\n## Analyzing the Similarities\n\nAt the beginning of the ExPetr outbreak, one of our team members\n\npointed to the fact that the specific list of extensions used by ExPetr is\n\nvery similar to the one used by BlackEnergy’s KillDisk ransomware from\n\n[2015 and 2016 (Anton Cherepanov from ESET made the same observation](https://twitter.com/cherepanov74/status/879789032401719296)\n\non Twitter).\n\n[The BlackEnergy APT is a sophisticated threat actor that is known to have](https://securelist.com/blackenergy-apt-attacks-in-ukraine-employ-spearphishing-with-word-documents/73440/)\n\nused at least one zero day, coupled with destructive tools, and code\n\ngeared towards attacking ICS systems. They are widely confirmed as the\n\nentity behind the Ukraine power grid attack from 2015 as well as a chain\n\nof other destructive attacks that plagued that country over the past years.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more about the BlackEnergy APT, be sure\n\nto check our previous blogs on the topic:\n\n[BE2 custom plugins, router abuse and target profiles](https://securelist.com/be2-custom-plugins-router-abuse-and-target-profiles/67353/)\n\n[BE2 extraordinary plugins](https://securelist.com/be2-extraordinary-plugins-siemens-targeting-dev-fails/68838/)\n\nBlackEnergy APT Attacks in Ukraine employ spearphishing with Word\n\ndocuments\n\n\n-----\n\nlists looks in ExPetr and a version of a wiper used by the BE APT group in\n\n2015:\n\n2015 BlackEnergy wiper\nExPetr\n\nsample\n\n.3ds, .7z, .accdb, .accdc, .ai,\n\n.asp, .aspx, .avhd, .back,\n\n.bak, .bin, .bkf, .cer, .cfg,\n\n.conf, .crl, .crt, .csr, .csv,\n\n.dat, .db3, .db4, .dbc, .dbf,\n\n\n3ds, .7z, .accdb, .ai, .asp,\n\n.aspx, .avhd, .back, .bak,\n\n.c, .cfg, .conf, .cpp, .cs,\n\n.ctl, .dbf, .disk, .djvu,\n\n.doc, .docx, .dwg, .eml,\n\n.fdb, .gz, .h, .hdd, .kdbx,\n\n.mail, .mdb, .msg, .nrg,\n\n.ora, .ost, .ova, .ovf, .pdf,\n\n.php, .pmf, .ppt, .pptx,\n\n.pst, .pvi, .py, .pyc, .rar,\n\n.rtf, .sln, .sql, .tar, .vbox,\n\n.vbs, .vcb, .vdi, .vfd, .vmc,\n\n.vmdk, .vmsd, .vmx,\n\n.vsdx, .vsv, .work, .xls\n\n\n.dbx, .djvu, .doc, .docx, .dr,\n\n.dwg, .dxf, .edb, .eml, .fdb,\n\n.gdb, .git, .gz, .hdd, .ib, .ibz,\n\n.io, .jar, .jpeg, .jpg, .jrs, .js,\n\n.kdbx, .key, .mail, .max,\n\n.mdb, .mdbx, .mdf, .mkv,\n\n.mlk, .mp3, .msi, .my, .myd,\n\n.nsn, .oda, .ost, .ovf, .p7b,\n\n.p7c, .p7r, .pd, .pdf, .pem,\n\n.pfx, .php, .pio, .piz, .png,\n\n.ppt, .pptx, .ps, .ps1, .pst,\n\n.pvi, .pvk, .py, .pyc, .rar, .rb,\n\n.rtf, .sdb, .sdf, .sh, .sl3, .spc,\n\n.sql, .sqlite, .sqlite3, .tar, .tiff,\n\n.vbk, .vbm, .vbox, .vcb, .vdi,\n\n.vfd, .vhd, .vhdx, .vmc,\n\n.vmdk, .vmem, .vmfx, .vmsd,\n\n.vmx, .vmxf, .vsd, .vsdx, .vsv,\n\n.wav, .wdb, .xls, .xlsx, .xvd,\n\n.zip\n\n\nObviously, the lists are similar in composition and formatting, but not\n\nidentical. Moreover, older versions of the BE destructive module have\n\neven longer lists. Here’s a snippet of an extensions list from a 2015 BE\n\nsample that is even longer:\n\nNevertheless, the lists were similar in the sense of being stored in the\n\nsame dot-separated formats. Although this indicated a possible link, we\n\nwondered if we could find more similarities, especially in the code of\n\nolder variants of BlackEnergy and ExPetr.\n\n\n-----\n\nand shared this gut feeling of a similarity between ExPetr and BlackEnergy\n\nwith our friends at Palo Alto Networks. Together, we tried to build a list of\n\nfeatures that we could use to make a YARA rule to detect both ExPetr and\n\nBlackEnergy wipers.\n\nDuring the analysis, we focused on the similar extensions list and the code\n\nresponsible for parsing the file system for encryption or wiping. Here’s the\n\ncode responsible for checking the extensions to target in the current\n\nversion of ExPetr:\n\nThis works by going through the target file system in a recursive way, then\n\nchecking if the extension for each file is included in the dot-separated list.\n\nUnfortunately for our theory, the way this is implemented in older\n\nBlackEnergy variants is quite different; the code is more generic and the\n\nlist of extensions to target is initialized at the beginning, and passed down\n\nto the recursive disk listing function.\n\nInstead, we took the results of automated code comparisons and paired\n\nthem down to a signature that perfectly fit the mould of both in the hope\n\nof unearthing similarities. What we came up with is a combination of\n\ngeneric code and interesting strings that we put together into a cohesive\n\nrule to single out both BlackEnergy KillDisk components and ExPetr\n\nsamples. The main example of this generic code is the inlined wcscmp\n\nfunction merged by the compiler’s optimization, meant to check if the\n\nfilename is the current folder, which is named “.”. Of course, this code is\n\npretty generic and can appear in other programs that recursively list files.\n\nIt’s inclusion alongside a similar extension list makes it of particular\n\ninterest to us –but remains a low confidence indicator.\n\nLooking further, we identified some other candidate strings which,\n\nlth h t i h bi d t th ll t fi i t th\n\n\n-----\n\nexe /r /f\n\nComSpec\n\nInitiateSystemShutdown\n\nWhen put together with the wcscmp inlined code that checks on the\n\nfilename, we get the following YARA rule:\n\n1\n2 rule blackenergy_and_petya_similarities {\n3\n4 strings:\n5 //shutdown.exe /r /f\n6 $bytes00 = { 73 00 68 00 75 00 74 00 64 00 6f 00 77 00 6e\n7\n8 //ComSpec\n9 $bytes01 = { 43 00 6f 00 6d 00 53 00 70 00 65 00 63 00 }\n10\n11 //InitiateSystemShutdown\n12 $bytes02 = { 49 6e 69 74 69 61 74 65 53 79 73 74 65 6d 53\n13\n14 //68A4430110           push     0100143A4 ;’n\n15 //FF151CD10010          call     GetModuleHand\n16 //3BC7              cmp     eax,edi\n17 //7420              jz     …\n18 $bytes03 = { 68 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 ff 15 ?? ?? ?? ?0 3b c7 74 ??\n19\n20 // “/c”\n21 $bytes04 = { 2f 00 63 00 }\n22\n23 //wcscmp(…\n24 $hex_string = { b9 ?? ?? ?1 ?0 8d 44 24 ?c 66 8b 10 66 3b\n25 85 d2 74 15 66 8b 50 02 66 3b 51 02 75\n26 de 33 c0 eb 05 1b c0 83 d8 ff 85 c0 0f\n27 44 24 ?c 66 8b 10 66 3b 11 75 1e 66 85\n28 75 0f 83 c0 04 83 c1 04 66 85 d2 75 de\n29 0f 84 ?? 0? 00 00 }\n30\n31 condition:\n32\n33 ((uint16(0) == 0x5A4D)) and (filesize < 5000000) and\n34 (all of them)\n\n}\n\nWhen run on our extensive (read: very big) malware collection, the YARA\n\nrule above fires on BlackEnergy and ExPetr samples only. Unsurprisingly,\n\nwhen used alone, each string can generate false positives or catch other\n\nunrelated malware. However, when combined together in this fashion,\n\nthey become very precise. The technique of grouping generic or popular\n\nstrings together into unique combinations is one of the most effective\n\nmethods for writing powerful Yara rules.\n\nOf course, this should not be considered a sign of a definitive link, but it\n\ndoes point to certain code design similarities between these malware\n\nfamilies.\n\n\n-----\n\nother researchers around the world to join us in investigating these\n\nsimilarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of\n\nExPetr/Petya. Looking back at other high profile cases, such as the\n\nBangladesh Bank Heist or Wannacry, there were few facts linking them to\n\nthe Lazarus group. In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and\n\nothers, to link them together with high confidence. Further research can\n\nbe crucial to connecting the dots, or, disproving these theories.\n\nWe’d like to think of this ongoing research as an opportunity for an open\n\ninvitation to the larger security community to help nail down (or disprove)\n\nthe link between BlackEnergy and ExPetr/Petya. Our colleagues at ESET\n\nhave published their own excellent analysis suggesting a possible link\n\nbetween ExPetr/Petya and TeleBots (BlackEnergy). Be sure to check out\n\ntheir analysis. And as mentioned before, a special thanks to our friends at\n\nPalo Alto for their contributions on clustering BlackEnergy samples.\n\n###### Hashes\n\nExPetr:\n\n027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a7\n\n45\n\nBE:\n\n11b7b8a7965b52ebb213b023b6772dd2c76c66893fc96a18a9a33c8cf125a\n\nf80\n\n5d2b1abc7c35de73375dd54a4ec5f0b060ca80a1831dac46ad411b4fe4eac\n\n4c6\n\nF52869474834be5a6b5df7f8f0c46cbc7e9b22fa5cb30bee0f363ec6eb056\n\nb95\n\n368d5c536832b843c6de2513baf7b11bcafea1647c65df7b6f2648840fa50f\n\n75\n\nA6a167e214acd34b4084237ba7f6476d2e999849281aa5b1b3f92138c7d91\n\nc7a\n\nEdbc90c217eebabb7a9b618163716f430098202e904ddc16ce9db994c65\n\n09310\n\nF9f3374d89baf1878854f1700c8d5a2e5cf40de36071d97c6b9ff6b55d837f\n\nca\n\n\n-----\n\n[WIPER](https://securelist.com/all?tag=214)\n\n\n#####   \n\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n###### BlackOasis APT and new targeted attacks leveraging zero-day exploit\n\n\n###### The Festive Complexities of SIGINT- Capable Threat Actors\n\n\n###### Introducing WhiteBear\n\n\n-----",
