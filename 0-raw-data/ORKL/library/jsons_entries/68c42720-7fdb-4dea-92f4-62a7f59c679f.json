    "plain_text": "# Lockbit 3.0: Another Upgrade to World’s Most Active Ransomware\n\n**[socradar.io/lockbit-3-another-upgrade-to-worlds-most-active-ransomware/](https://socradar.io/lockbit-3-another-upgrade-to-worlds-most-active-ransomware/)**\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\nLockbit Ransomware gang, also known as Bitwise Spider, are the cybercriminal masterminds\n[behind the popular Lockbit Ransomware-as-a-service. They are one of the most active](https://socradar.io/what-is-ransomware-as-a-service-raas/)\nransomware gangs with generally multiple victims per day, sometimes higher. On March 16,\n2022, they began continuously announcing new victims on their Dark Web site much faster\nthan any ransomware group. SOCRadar has detected more than 22 victims in 48 hours.\n\n## Origins of the Lockbit Ransomware\n\n[They have begun their operations in September 2019 as ABCD ransomware and then](https://socradar.io/the-story-of-lockbit-ransomware/)\nchanged its name to Lockbit. They have rebranded and came back with even better\nransomware on June 2021, as Lockbit 2.0. We have seen that the Lockbit 2.0 ransomware\nintroduced new features such as shadow copy and log file deletion to make recovery\nharder for the victims. In addition, Lockbit has the fastest encryption speed among the most\npopular ransomware gangs, with around 25 thousand files encrypted in under one minute.\n\n[The gang is believed to be originated in Russia. According to a detailed analysis of Lockbit](https://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2022/03/19/LockbitRansomware/)\n[2.0, the ransomware checks the default system language and avoids encryption, and stops](https://socradar.io/lets-start-from-the-beginning-what-is-encryption/)\nthe attack if the victim system’s language is Russian or the language of one of the nearby\n\n\n-----\n\ncountries.\n\nLockbit 2.0 checks the language of the victim machine\n\n### Lockbit on Russia – Ukraine Cyberwar\n\nIn the [cyber crisis between Russia and Ukraine, which began on February 23rd, 2022,](https://socradar.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-russian-cyber-escalation-in-ukraine/)\nLockbit announced that it would not participate in the cyberattacks. They announced that\nthey would not take part in cyberattacks on international conflicts. They are only in it for the\nbusiness and do not care about politics. Another very active ransomware gang also believed\nto be from Russia, Conti, had stated that they would be siding with Russia, which some\nmembers of Conti were not pleased with. Following the events, some insider members of\n**Conti began leaking internal chat logs and source code for the Conti locker and decryptor.**\n[You can read more about the Conti Leaks in our blog post.](https://socradar.io/an-overview-on-conti-ransomware-leaks-is-this-the-end-for-conti/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLockbit’s announcement on the Russia-Ukraine Cyberwar\nA funny detail about the gang is that they are confident in their skills and arrogant. On March\n25, 2022, a member of Lockbit has announced on a hacker forum that they’ll be giving a\nmillion dollars to an FBI agent who can doxx them, placing a million-dollar bounty on its own\nhead.\n\n\n-----\n\nA member of Lockbit placing bounty on its own head\n\n## Dark Web Gossips: Lockbit 3.0 Emerging\n\n[FBI’s cyber division published an FBI Flash security advisory on Lockbit 2.0’s Indicators of](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220204.pdf)\n**Compromise (IOCs) on March 4th, 2022. After the FBI’s advisory, a user in a** [Dark Web](https://socradar.io/solutions/dark-and-deep-web-monitoring/)\nforum has posted a forum entry with the title “Kockbit fuckup thread.” In the post, the user\naddresses the bugs found in Lockbit 2.0 ransomware and a recovery method for the victims,\naddressing the FBI’s advisory along with Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team’s\n(DART’s) research on Lockbit. Below, you can find the links for Microsoft DART’s research.\nMicrosoft DART researchers have discovered a method by uncovering and exploiting bugs\nfound in the Lockbit 2.0 ransomware, enabling them to successfully revert the encryption\nprocess on an MSSQL database of one of Lockbit’s victims.\n\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/part-1-lockbit2-0-ransomware-bugs-and-database-recovery/ba-p/3254354\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/part-2-lockbit2-0-ransomware-bugs-and-database-recovery/ba-p/3254421\n\nDark web forum post on Lockbit bugs and a recovery method\nA member of the Lockbit ransomware group has commented on the post explaining the\nreason for the MSSQL bug. The Lockbit member says the bug will not exist in Lockbit 3.0,\nsignaling the newest version’s release.\n\n\n-----\n\nLockbit member’s comment on the post\nAfter a couple of days, on March 17, the cyber research team vx-underground has posted a\nscreenshot of their talks with one of Lockbit’s associates. On the screenshot, the vxunderground researcher asks when Lockbit 3.0 is being released, and the Lockbit affiliate\nsays the newest version will be released in one or two weeks.\n\nSource: vx-underground\nThe Lockbit group is still using the Lockbit 2.0 name, but we can expect an update in the\nfollowing month. It has been two weeks since vx-underground tweeted their conversation\nwith the Lockbit affiliate, but the Lockbit team has no deadline to uphold. They can release\nthe new version whenever they want.\n\nThe new features and upgrades in Lockbit 3.0 is still a mystery.
