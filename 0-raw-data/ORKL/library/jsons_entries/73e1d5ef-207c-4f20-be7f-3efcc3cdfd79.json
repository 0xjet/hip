Therefore, activity related to this\nthreat is likely to increase as the malware continues to mature.”\n\n_[Featured image via Rob Koopman,](https://www.flickr.com/photos/koopmanrob/5523527145/)_ _[CC BY-ND 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/)_\n\nTags\n\n[Ares](https://therecord.media/tag/ares/)\n[banker](https://therecord.media/tag/banker/)\n[banking trojan](https://therecord.media/tag/banking-trojan/)\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[hacking forum](https://therecord.media/tag/hacking-forum/)\n[Kronos](https://therecord.media/tag/kronos/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[Osiris](https://therecord.media/tag/osiris/)\n[retirement](https://therecord.media/tag/retirement/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
