To ensure the smooth flow\n\nthese cybercriminal hideouts.\n\nof transactions, both hideouts and BPHSs must be\n\nstrategically located to make them harder to seize\n\n\n-----\n\n### BPHS basics\n\nBulletproof hosting servers are hardware-, software-, or application-based hosting facilities that can store\n\nany type of content or executable code. Unlike regular hosts, bulletproof servers can primarily host malicious\n\ncontent like phishing sites, pornography, fake shopping and carding sites, and command-and-control (C&C)\n\ninfrastructure.\n\nBPHS operations are complex; diversifying bulletproof-hosting-server structures, much more so. On one\n\nhand, bulletproof hosts need to offer solid services that ensure stability to customers. On the other, BPHS\n\nproviders aspire to appear as legitimate as possible so authorities would not shut them down. Bulletproof host\n\nowners rent hardware colocation facilities in various countries to ensure the continuity of their operations.\n\nThey normally rely on countries with lax laws to minimize the risk of being blacklisted or shut down.\n\n###### Noteworthy BPHS providers\n\nThe Russian Business Network (RBN) can be considered one of the first big BPHS providers. It was rooted\n\non free-hosting service providers like narod.ru, GeoCities.com (now Yahoo! Small Business), ucoz.ru, and\n\ntripod.com, which were ad based [1]. Tagging their service offerings “free” allowed the providers to gain\n\npopularity as hosts to small phishing campaigns and good places to store and share music and other files.\n\nAs time passed, anyone who wanted to earn from cybercrime required “professional” hosting services in the\n\nform of bulletproof servers. Though RBN provided services worldwide, it also primarily served local clients.\n\nPerhaps the most notable BPHS-related incident recorded in history happened on March 2013 [2], when the\n\ninfamous Off-sho.re and a group of attackers, all BPHS providers, targeted Spamhaus—a project established\n\nin 1998 by Steve Linford to track email spammers [3, 4]. The attack caused the site to crash.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Popular content and services\n\nBPHS providers in certain countries or regions specialize in hosting different kinds of content and services.\n\nWhat we listed below are just a few of the many content and service types:\n\n- **Fakes shopping sites: These include sites that sell any kind of fake products (watches, designer clothes,**\n\nelectronics, pharmaceuticals, etc.) to users in various countries where selling them may be prohibited\n\nand punishable by law.\n\n- **Torrent file download sites: These strictly follow internally structured rules that help them keep**\n\ntheir torrent files searchable and accessible [5].\n\n- **Blackhat search engine optimization (SEO) pseudo sites: These are developed and maintained**\n\nfor fully searching engines so customers can buy or sell Web traffic, which can help them get bigger\n\nrevenue from their own sites. They also act as traffic concentrators, traffic direction systems (TDSs), drop\n\nzones, or doorways. The traffic driven to customers’ sites is, in most cases, obtained through malicious or\n\nfraudulent techniques and tools like malvertising, fake apps, and iframes.\n\n- **Brute-forcing tools: Sites that host these focus on discovering weak passwords and access credentials**\n\nthat can be exploited and owned to compromise email accounts, server infrastructure, Web-based services,\n\nand other online accounts. Brute-forcing tools scan networks and guess passwords to gain access.\n\n- **C&C components: Sites that host these have environments suited for controlling networks of infected**\n\nclient systems and other botnet-related infrastructure (infected file drop zones, exploit kit locations,\n\nstolen data storage sites, etc.).\n\n- **Virtual private networks (VPNs): These hosting facilities can act as exit points to protect their**\n\nowners’ privacy from security researchers and law-enforcement agencies.\n\n- **Warez forums: These provide information on overriding protective measures against software and**\n\nhardware piracy. They refer to sites where key generators, cheat codes, and commercial software can be\n\nobtained for free.\n\n- **Files that violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)** [6]: Sites that host these\n\ncontain all kinds of commercially available copyrighted content, which can be downloaded free of charge.\n\n- **Spam: Sites that host these also contain all kinds of tools used in mass-mailing attacks for profit or other**\n\nmalicious gains.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Classifying BPHSs\n\nGiven the diversity of features that BPHSs offer, we devised a simple set of criteria below that would allow\n\nfellow researchers to better classify and analyze them:\n\n1 Business model How do BPHS providers operate?\n\n\n2 Toxicity level How malicious (toxic/dangerous) is the content/service hosted on\na BPHS infrastructure?\n\n3 Geolocation Where are the bulletproof servers physically located?\n\n4 Targets and exceptions Which regions are targeted by/protected from the hosted\ncontent?\n\n5 Price How much does hosting cost?\n\n6 Popularity How popular are BPHS providers based on customer feedback?\n\n\n7 Longevity How long has a BPHS provider been operating?\n\n###### Business model\n\nBPHS providers operate in a number of ways. We’ve broken them down into three simple models.\n\n###### Model 1: Dedicated bulletproof servers\n\nThose who operate under this model know exactly what they’re doing. BPHS providers who use this business\n\nmodel allow their customers to host content that may be considered illegal in certain countries.\n\n###### Cybercriminals BPHSs Dedicated bulletproof servers\n\n Price: US$70+ Owner: BPHS providers\n\n_Dedicated BPHS business model_\n\n\n-----\n\nThese BPHS operators make their infrastructure appear as legitimate as possible to avoid arousing suspicion\n\nfrom law enforcement. They also make their servers as takedown-proof as possible. This is why cybercriminals\n\noften avail of their services. They will continue to make their servers available to customers unless they are\n\nmandated to stop serving bad content.\n\n_Sample contact details of a BPHS provider_\n\nProviders who use this model often only make their ICQ or phone number publicly available. In the given\n\nexample, a provider is renting out a bulletproof server for US$70 or more a month.\n\n###### Model 2: Compromised dedicated servers\n\nSome BPHS providers choose to compromise dedicated servers. They then rent these out to parties who wish\n\nto host malicious content. But this is a temporary setup. Once the real owner of the compromised server\n\ndetects the anomaly, the BPHS providers can no longer use the server.\n\n###### Cybercriminals BPHSs Compromised dedicated servers\n\n Price: US$5+ Owner: Innocent\n\n_Dedicated servers compromised_ server owners\n_for malicious use_\n\n\n-----\n\nHosts of this type are often used to facilitate blackhat SEO and brute-forcing attacks. Below is a list of\n\ncompromised dedicated servers ideal for brute-forcing attacks. For US$5, a customer can rent a server for a\n\none-time attack.\n\n_Sample market list of compromised dedicated servers (Дедики)_\n\nThese servers can also be used as a malicious traffic proxy and act as a stolen data drop zone. Due to the\n\nunstable availability of this service, it is rarely used for C&C activities.\n\n###### Model 3: Abused cloud-hosting services\n\nGoing back to our crime ring comparison, we can think of the providers in this category as strict landlords\n\nwho run an honest business. They lease their units to tenants and don’t tolerate rule breakers. This doesn’t\n\nstop their tenants from engaging in illegal operations in the privacy of their own units though.\n\n###### Cybercriminals BPHSs Abused cloud-hosting services\n\nDepends on the Examples include\n###### Price: cloud-hosting Cloud-hosting services abused  Owner: AWS, Hetzner,\nservice OVH, LeaseWeb\n\n_for malicious purposes_\n\n\n-----\n\nLegitimate providers may restrict the hosting of malicious content on their dedicated servers, but some\n\nof their customers will still find ways to abuse their infrastructure. Abusive customers are only stopped\n\nif they are reported and consequently blacklisted. In the past, we’ve seen providers like Amazon Web\n\nServices (AWS) [7], Hetzner [8], OVH [9], and LeaseWeb [10] have their services abused by cybercriminals.\n\nThe criminals either used their infrastructure as C&C server or drop zone for stolen data.\n\n###### Toxicity\n\nThe toxicity of a bulletproof server depends on the kind of content hosted on it. The more illicit or malicious\n\nthe content, the more unsafe it is to host. It is therefore much harder to find a BPHS provider that allows\n\nhighly toxic content hosting.\n\nMalicious content stored in bulletproof hosts and their corresponding toxicity\n\nHOSTED CONTENT TOXICITY LEVEL\n\nChild exploitation Very high\n\nC&C components\n\nExploits High\n\nMalware\n\nSpam\n\nBrute-forcing tools Medium\n\nTorrent file download sites\n\nFiles that violate DMCA\n\nVPNs\n\nShopping sites for fake goods Low\n\nBlackhat SEO pseudo sites\n\nAdult content\n\n_Note: Though none of the BPHS providers admit to hosting content related to child exploitation,_\n_it doesn’t mean that such content may be found up on their domains._\n\n###### Geolocation\n\nA server’s physical location is always important, especially when considering what’s legal and illegal in the\n\ncountries where BPHS providers operate. Deploying a blackhat SEO doorway server or establishing an online\n\nshop for fake watches may be legal in certain countries but not in others.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo minimize risks, attackers normally rent bulletproof servers that don’t share their intended targets’\n\ngeolocation. A BPHS customer, for instance, can attack users in the United States using an exploit kit hosted\n\non a server in Lebanon. The geographical distance between the BPHS provider and targets slows down the\n\nreaction time on abuse reports.\n\n\nBPHS users, meanwhile, who host content that violate DMCA prefer to be as near as possible to their\n\ncustomers in order to minimize connection latency.\n\n\nDiversifying BPHS infrastructure protects providers from becoming victims of distributed denial-of-service\n\n(DDoS) attacks and blacklisting. This measure allows them to distribute resources and evade detection.\n\n\nTo show how diverse BPHS offerings and prices are, we analyzed a small sample. The list in the table below\n\nis by no means exhaustive, but it does show how diverse BPHSs are.\n\n\nSample BPHS offerings by host country\n\nFiles that violate DMCA x x x x x x x\n\n\nVPNs x x x x x\n\nFakes shopping sites x x x x\n\n\nSpam x x\n\nC&C components x x x\n\n\nTorrent download sites x x x\n\nBlackhat SEO pseudo sites x x x\n\n\nWarez forums x x x\n\n\nBrute-forcing tools x x x x\n\n\n_The list of offerings in the table above is by no means exhaustive._\n_Bulletproof hosts may operate in countries that aren’t in the list._\n\nA lot of BPHS infrastructures have remained relatively unchanged over time, especially in countries where\n\nthey are difficult to legally shut down. In stricter countries, BPHS providers move their servers around a\n\nlot to keep their services online. They also use untraceable Whois details to register servers aided by fake\n\n\nidentification documents and/or privacy-protection legal services, which can be quite costly.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Targets and exceptions\n\nWe’ve seen notifications posted on BPHS providers’ sites that claim they protect the interests of the countries\n\nthey operate from. Everything outside is fair game and can be considered targets. This could be due to two\n\nprimary reasons:\n\n- Local law-enforcement authorities have an easier time tracking attackers who go after victims from their\n\nhost country. These attackers are, after all, under the law enforcers’ jurisdiction. In such cases, BPHS\n\nproviders are forced to move to other countries that have laxer laws.\n\nA good example of this is Pirate Bay. Before it was taken down in 2009, it moved its operations to\n\nthe Ukraine and has almost had no problems since then [11]. This could be due to the fact that under\n\nUkrainian communication laws, providers are not responsible for what their customers do. It also has\n\nmultiple backup servers in various countries.\n\n- Some governments either sponsor or control a number of BPHS providers. This protects the latter from\n\nbeing shut down.\n\n_Warez forum notice that bans content that can harm Russia and some Eastern European countries_\n\n###### Pricing\n\nBPHS prices depend on the risk involved in hosting certain content:\n\n- **Low: BPHS providers that allow low-risk content hosting rent out their servers for as low as US$2 per**\n\nmonth. This kind of offer is available in several countries. Any customer found guilty of engaging in\n\nmalicious or fraudulent activities can be refused service.\n\n- **Medium: Predominantly based in Russia and Lebanon, these servers can host both medium- and high-**\n\nrisk content for around US$70 (hardware) or US$20 (virtual private server [VPS]) per month.\n\n- **High: At US$300 or more per month, a customer can host critical infrastructure projects or high-risk**\n\ncontent in servers mostly based in China, Bolivia, Iran, and the Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Popularity\n\nA BPHS provider’s popularity can be determined based on forum recommendations and customer feedback.\n\nSatisfied clients usually create forum threads to show their appreciation. Novice BPHS providers who haven’t\n\nhad many customers yet can enhance their reputations by providing a guarantee of at least US$1,000.\n\n_Sample feedback from a satisfied BPHS customer_\n\n###### Longevity\n\nThe reputation of BPHS providers also relies on how long they’ve been serving customers in the cybercriminal\n\nunderground without having to change their name or domain. Being able to keep their name or domain for a\n\nlong time shows that they are able to ensure the confidentiality of their customers’ activities from the prying\n\neyes of security researchers and law enforcers. Changing names or domains could often mean that the BPHS\n\nprovider keeps getting caught dealing with underground elements and eventually gets shut down. Longevity\n\ncan be determined by observing forum activities and reading customer feedback.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The case of RandServers\n\nA good example of a BPHS provider is RandServers. We first encountered it being promoted by a forum user\n\nwith the handle “sosweet.”\n\n_Forum post by sosweet on darkmoney.cc promoting RandServers_\n\nBased on the underground forum thread we found, RandServers claims it can host any type of content with\n\nsome restrictions. It doesn’t, for instance, allow hosting any content related to child pornography.\n\nAvailing of RandServers’s services requires talking to its support team that gives potential customers a list\n\nof package offerings. All packages include the use of Radware (a DDoS-mitigation application) and Cacti or\n\nZabbix (monitoring tools). Some also include the use of out-of-the-box solutions for hosting ZeuS, Citadel, or\n\nCARBERP C&C servers. Others give customers an option to use virtual private or dedicated servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Who are behind RandServers?\n\nForum posts on RandServers don’t contain contact information. Clicking any of the two light bulbs though\n\ntakes users to the BPHS provider’s site, _http s://rand serv ers.com, which contains details on its service_\n\nofferings.\n\n_The light bulbs point to RandServers’s site that showcases its service offerings_\n\nWe dug a little and found an open folder with some of the content from the provider’s old site\n\n(ht tp://rand servers.com/lc/). This folder, however, has now been removed.\n\n_Site of LanKeeper.org, a DDoS-mitigation service provider based in Kharkiv, Ukraine_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe conducted an open source intelligence (OSINT) investigation to find out more about sosweet. This person\n\nposted RandServers ads and most likely responded to technical and sales queries on forum pages. Sosweet,\n\nwhose Jabber username is “OVERFLOW@PIZDEC.TODAY,” answered questions related to RandServers’s\n\nservice offerings.\n\nA complaint by a user named “Fsystem” on a forum thread revealed information on sosweet, particularly the\n\nlatter’s WebMoney wallet ID, “Z186456037356.” Users don’t usually give out this ID number to just anyone.\n\n_Sosweet’s WebMoney wallet details exposed on exploit.in_\n\nThis information allowed us to obtain more details on sosweet, including his name, birth date, address, and\n\nmobile number.\n\nA look at pastebin.com for information on sosweet turned up the document, http ://pastebi n.com/1UiJ4tZe,\n\nwhich was most likely a virtual host configuration file for Nginx. It contained the email address,\n\n_overf lowpps@gmail .com. A look at the reset parameter for the email address showed the mobile number_\n\n“************9,” which was likely sosweet’s mobile number tied to his WebMoney wallet ID.\n\nWe chatted with the owner of over flowpps@gmail .com in the guise of a possible customer looking for IP\n\naddresses or an ISP based in Western Europe. The person suggested RandServers. A sales representative\n\nwho owned the address confirmed that the provider rents colocation services from OVH to serve\n\ncustomers’ needs.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Jabber chat with over flowpps@gmail .com_\n\nThe following table sums up our findings on RandServers:\n\n\nCRITERIA DETAILS\n\n\nBusiness model RandServers follows both models 1 and 3. It has its own infrastructure\nthat allows it to host all kinds of content, but it also rents small\ncolocation environments from well-known ISPs like OVH.\n\n\nToxicity level RandServers is highly toxic since it allows customers to host all kinds of\ncontent, including malicious content.\n\nGeolocation The servers are physically located in a part of the Ukraine that is difficult\nto locate and reach. The rented ones are located in the Netherlands and\nCanada.\n\nTargets and RandServers’s customers aren’t required to have preferred country\nexceptions targets though the provider strictly disallows attacks against any entity\nwith ties to the Ukraine.\n\nPricing Service offerings cost from US$100 a month (VPSs) to US$300 a month\n(dedicated servers).\n\nPopularity We saw complaints regarding 24 x 7 support availability and VPS\ninstability.\n\n\nLongevity Three years\n\n\n-----\n\n### What keeps BPHS providers alive?\n\n###### Technical support\n\nThe scale of a BPHS provider’s operation isn’t really important to its customers; what matters more is its ability\n\nto provide immediate support. Strong BPHS providers have a very good support team who communicates\n\nwith clients via ICQ, Jabber, or their own JavaScript™-based messaging service. Like legitimate providers,\n\ntheir support team uses a ticketing system to process queries.\n\n###### Infrastructure migration due to blacklisting\n\nLaw enforcement agencies, security vendors, and root-hosting service providers commonly blacklist BPHS\n\nproviders. This is why BPHS providers are very interested in feeds from organizations like Spamhaus and\n\nsecurity vendors. They constantly check if their IP subnets or addresses have been categorized as malicious.\n\nIn case these have, BPHS providers immediately move their infrastructure while conducting internal\n\ninvestigations to find out which customer violated their rules.\n\n###### Protection against DDoS attacks\n\nBPHS infrastructure can be the subject of serious DDoS attacks due to various reasons. Perhaps the most\n\ncommon is abusive customers. As such, high-end BPHS providers offer DDoS protection as part of their\n\nstandard package.\n\n###### Software to control VPSs\n\nBPHS clients need full control over the physical or VPSs they rent from providers. Experienced clients can\n\nmanage servers using the command-line interface though others need Windows® and a mouse to do so.\n\nMost BPHS providers offer such for free or a fee via Web-based interfaces, which usually have installations\n\nfor File Transfer Protocol (FTP), virtual hosts, Apache, PHP, Cron, email configuration, Secure Sockets Layer\n\n(SSL), proxy, and one-click content management systems (CMSs).\n\nToday’s markets have several applications that allow users to fully control most of the services normally\n\nfound on physical or VPSs like cPanel, ISPmanager, DirectAdmin, and Parallels Plesk.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Proxying visibility using whitehat-provided services\n\nBPHS providers sometimes hide their IP addresses behind whitehat-provided proxy services. This isn’t very\n\ncommon, but techniques to protect real BPHS IP addresses from detection work, especially when they are\n\nused to deploy and run exploits. A good example of this involves CloudFlare, which was used as a proxy by\n\nthose behind the Fiesta Exploit Kit [12].\n\n###### Multilevel proxying via distributed VPS presence\n\nSome BPHS providers allow clients to build networks of multilayer VPSs with Nginx Reverse Proxy\n\ntechnology. This enables HTTP requests to pass through and allows the modification of headers and content\n\n(as in man-in-the-middle [MitM] attacks) to hide the address of real destination servers. Strong bulletproof\n\nprotection requires a multilayer structure and specifically configured A or CNAME Domain Name System\n\n(DNS) records with multiple IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) with high SEO scores, if\n\npossible [13, 14]. That way, losing one VPS or FQDN due to detection and takedown from a chain of domains\n\nand servers doesn’t affect the core VPS.\n\nMultilevel and distributed VPS and FQDN infrastructures normally drive up hosting costs but ensure stability.\n\nAn example of a professional BPHS provider that provides multilevel VPS proxy services is Eurobyte.\n\n###### Advertising\n\nEvery BPHS provider relies on advertising to gain potential clients. But because they need to stay under the\n\nradar, they do so only on underground forums and similar venues. At present, two types of BPHS ads exist:\n\n- **Legitimate ads: These appear as search results for a query on BPHS providers. They don’t, however,**\n\nreveal ties to malicious activity. When clicked, the links lead to Web pages with more information on the\n\nproviders’ offerings, including contact details (normally ICQ, Jabber, or Skype IDs).\n\n- **Forum ads: Because these only appear on underground forums, BPHS providers can opt to include**\n\ndetails on shadier offerings. They normally take the form of clickable banners linked to forum threads\n\nwhere more detailed information like that normally seen on legitimate providers’ sites is given. BPHS\n\nproviders who use these rely on “thank you” messages from clients to widen their client bases.\n\n###### Forum ads for bulletproof blackhat-SEO-related services\n\nHosting sites for blackhat-SEO-related purposes is easy. It doesn’t require a really powerful server unless the\n\noperation involves a TDS. All it requires are permanent links and additional doorways for crawlers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_BPHS provider with expensive offerings_\n\n###### Forum ads for bulletproof VPN services\n\nAlmost every BPHS provider rents out machines that can be used as VPN exit nodes. Bad actors, however,\n\noften use stolen machines as VPN exit nodes. The second option is actually cheaper and quite stable. Bad\n\nactors can have 2–5 exit points for less if they avail of a real BPHS provider’s offerings.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Forum post advertising access to compromised dedicated servers that have been checked_\n\n###### Forum ads for BPHS for sites that violate DCMA\n\nA Romania-based BPHS provider called “Hostimvse.ru” specializes in sites that host torrent files and files\n\nthat violate DMCA.\n\n_Sample BPHS provider known for sites that host DMCA violators and torrent files_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Forum ads for bulletproof botnet-hosting services\n\nMy.Galkahost.com is an example of a distributed bulletproof hosting provider, which specializes in botnet\n\nC&C and SEO hosting. Service prices are determined on a case-to-case basis, but can be as low as US$10.\n\nBased on forum reviews, they sublease hosting facilities from Hetzner in Germany.\n\n_Sample BPHS provider known for providing botnet-hosting services_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Forum ads for bulletproof spam-sending IP addresses\n\nAn example of a known spam-related BPHS provider is Spamz.ru. Customers can avail of its offerings for\n\nUS$70. It comes with anti-DDoS-attack support and free services for seven days.\n\n_Sample ad for bulk-mail-sending support services_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ongoing security challenges\n\nGiven the complexity of bulletproof hosting, is it really possible to shut down BPHS operations?\n\nIn early 2013, a group of individuals with ties to the Gozi malware attacks were prosecuted for their\n\ncybercriminal activities. One of these men was the then 28-year-old Romanian, Mihai Ionut “Virus” Paunescu,\n\nadministrator of Power Host. He provided the Gozi operation’s BPHS needs. Paunescu leased around 130\n\nservers from legitimate hosting operations then resold them for cybercriminal use. He reportedly made €190\n\nper month for every server he resold. Because of his negligence though, the Romanian police were able to\n\nindict him.\n\n_Screenshot of the Power Host site taken in 2012_\n\n\n-----\n\nThough Power Host was taken down after Paunescu’s arrest, accessing its domain name now redirects to\n\nCloudFlare—a legitimate U.S. company, which interestingly provides DDoS protection and content delivery\n\nnetwork (CDN) services.\n\nSecurity vendors\ncontact BPHS providers\nregarding malicious\n\nCybercriminals activity; if providers\n\ndon't respond, security\nvendors block malicious\nsites then contact law\nenforcement agencies\nfor help with takedown\nefforts\n\nBPHS providers that Security Law\noperate in countries with vendors/ enforcement\n\nresearchers agencies\n\nstrict laws just transfer to\nthose with lax jurisdiction\n\nBPHSs\n\nto evade takedown\n\nDedicated Compromised Abused cloud-hosting\nbulletproof servers dedicated servers servers\n\nDDoS Spam Malware\n\nAffected users\n\n_The role that law enforcement agencies and security vendors play in BPHS takedowns_\n\n\n-----\n\nPower Host’s case shows that it is possible to take down BPHS operators, but doing so will require political\n\nwill and the cooperation of security vendors. Security providers like Trend Micro identify BPHS sites that host\n\nmalicious content and block access to them to protect customers. We also cooperate with law enforcement by\n\npassing on our research findings so they can take action as quickly as possible.\n\nLaw enforcement can place external pressure on companies that host malicious content. This kind of pressure\n\nworks well on service providers that follow the third business model. These are mostly legitimate enterprises\n\nthat don’t want to get shut down. Some hosting companies based in friendly countries like Germany often\n\ncomply to avoid any inconvenience.\n\nIn the case of providers that follow the first business model—meaning their bulletproof servers are dedicated\n\nto hosting malicious content, and are most probably based in countries with lax regulations—international\n\nlaw enforcement will have a much harder time putting pressure on them. There is an exception though.\n\nMany BPHS providers explicitly state that they don’t allow hosting any material that exploits children. Most\n\ncountries condemn that kind of content and actively work together with law enforcement to put a stop to\n\nhosting services that allow it.\n\nThe very nature of BPHSs is that they protect malicious activity against law enforcement, giving cybercriminals\n\nthe much-needed loophole to wriggle out of and escape from the clutches of both law enforcement and the\n\nsecurity industry. That loophole unfortunately largely remains open today.\n\nUnless major changes happen in the way international laws protect or turn a blind eye to services like these,\n\nBPHSs will continue to exist, and cybercriminals will continue to thrive. For our part, FTR will continue to\n\nwork with security colleagues in international law enforcement to drive up the cost of carrying out cybercrime\n\nin order to make the world safe for the exchange of digital information.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### “The very nature of BPHSs is that they\n\n protect malicious activity against law\n\n enforcement, giving cybercriminals the\n\n much-needed loophole to wriggle out of\n\n and escape from the clutches of both law\n\n enforcement and the security industry.\n\n That loophole unfortunately largely\n\n remains open today.”\n\n —Robert McArdle,\n\n###### Trend Micro FTR Senior Manager\n\n\n-----\n\n###### References\n\n1.
