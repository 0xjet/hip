    "plain_text": "# Taking Action Against Hackers in China\n\n**[about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china/](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china/)**\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nFacebook threat intelligence analysts and security experts work to find and stop a wide\n[range of threats including cyber espionage campaigns,](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/taking-action-against-hackers-in-bangladesh-and-vietnam/) [influence operations and hacking of](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\nour platform by nation-state actors and other groups. As part of these efforts, our teams\nroutinely disrupt adversary operations by disabling them, notifying users if they should take\nsteps to protect their accounts, sharing our findings publicly and continuing to improve the\nsecurity of our products.\n\nToday, we’re sharing actions we took against a group of hackers in China known in the\nsecurity industry as [Earth Empusa or](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/f/new-android-spyware-actionspy-revealed-via-phishing-attacks-from-earth-empusa.html) [Evil Eye — to disrupt their ability to use their](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2019/09/02/digital-crackdown-large-scale-surveillance-and-exploitation-of-uyghurs/)\ninfrastructure to abuse our platform, distribute malware and hack people’s accounts across\nthe internet. They targeted activists, journalists and dissidents predominantly among\nUyghurs from Xinjiang in China primarily living abroad in Turkey, Kazakhstan, the United\n\n\n-----\n\nStates, Syria, Australia, Canada and other countries. This group used various cyber\nespionage tactics to identify its targets and infect their devices with malware to enable\nsurveillance.\n\nThis activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation while obfuscating\nwho’s behind it. On our platform, this cyber espionage campaign manifested primarily in\nsending links to malicious websites rather than direct sharing of the malware itself. We saw\nthis activity slow down at various times, likely in response to our and other companies’\nactions to disrupt their activity.\n\nWe identified the following tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by this threat\nactor across the internet:\n\n**Selective targeting and exploit protection: This group took steps to conceal their**\nactivity and protect malicious tools by only infecting people with iOS malware when\nthey passed certain technical checks, including IP address, operating system, browser\nand country and language settings.\n**Compromising and impersonating news websites: This group set up malicious**\nwebsites that used look-alike domains for popular Uyghur and Turkish news sites. They\nalso appeared to have compromised legitimate websites frequently visited by their\ntargets as part of watering hole attacks. A watering hole attack is when hackers infect\nwebsites frequently visited by intended targets to compromise their devices. Some of\nthese web pages contained malicious javascript code that resembled previously\n[reported exploits, which installed iOS malware known as INSOMNIA on people’s](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/04/21/evil-eye-threat-actor-resurfaces-with-ios-exploit-and-updated-implant/)\ndevices once they were compromised.\n**Social engineering: This group used fake accounts on Facebook to create fictitious**\npersonas posing as journalists, students, human rights advocates or members of the\nUyghur community to build trust with people they targeted and trick them into clicking\non malicious links.\n**Using fake third party app stores: We found websites set up by this group that mimic**\nthird-party Android app stores where they published Uyghur-themed applications,\nincluding a keyboard app, prayer app, and dictionary app. These apps were trojanized\n(contained malware that misled people of its true intent) with two Android malware\nstrains — [ActionSpy or](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/f/new-android-spyware-actionspy-revealed-via-phishing-attacks-from-earth-empusa.html) [PluginPhantom.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-pluginphantom-new-android-trojan-abuses-droidplugin-framework/)\n**Outsourcing malware development: We’ve observed this group use several distinct**\nAndroid malware families. Specifically, our investigation and malware analysis found\nthat Beijing Best United Technology Co., Ltd. (Best Lh) and Dalian 9Rush Technology\nCo., Ltd. (9Rush), two Chinese companies, are the developers behind some of the\nAndroid tooling deployed by this group. Our assessment of one of them benefited from\nresearch by FireEye, a cybersecurity company. These China-based firms are likely part\nof a sprawling network of vendors, with varying degrees of operational security.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Industry tracking: Our industry peers have been tracking parts of this activity as being**\n[driven by a single threat actor broadly known as Earth Empusa, or](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/f/new-android-spyware-actionspy-revealed-via-phishing-attacks-from-earth-empusa.html) [Evil Eye,](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2019/09/02/digital-crackdown-large-scale-surveillance-and-exploitation-of-uyghurs/)\nor [PoisonCarp. Our investigation confirmed that the activity we are disrupting today](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/09/poison-carp-tibetan-groups-targeted-with-1-click-mobile-exploits/)\nclosely aligns with the first two — Earth Empusa or Evil Eye. While PoisonCarp shares\nsome TTPs including targeting and use of some of the same vendor-developed\nmalware, our on-platform analysis suggests that it is a separate cluster of activity.\n\nWe shared our findings and threat indicators with industry peers so they too can detect and\nstop this activity. To disrupt this operation, we blocked malicious domains from being shared\non our platform, took down the group’s accounts and notified people who we believe were\ntargeted by this threat actor.\n\n**Threat Indicators:**\n\n**Hashes**\n```\n MD5 Hash Description Malware\n                                   Family\n\n```\n```\n10c1f38305792a0f925e8a2cf94\n82ce3\n3c0a20f0726032ad816e6709715\n09b2d\n01fe88068e43c2276f7d8bbf548\n24f0f\nfd8da30dd9e45bd31af79a9652d\n50ece\n10748ca7648d26316b4857b6139\nca93d\na5199e6f1904f5a532a562fbb9d\n5abc6\n\n```\n```\nKeyboard Plugin\n                Phantom\n\n```\n\n系统服务 (System Service) `Plugin`\n```\n                Phantom\n\n```\n地球 (Earth) `Plugin`\n```\n                Phantom\nAwazlikKitap Plugin\n                Phantom\nUighur Keyboard Plugin\n                Phantom\n\n```\n```\nﻛەرىﻢ رﺋﺎنۇﻗ (The Holy\nQuran)\n\n```\n```\nPlugin\nPhantom\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n 670a389a93b82ccf198dd7789a8\n 65096\n 9bc5fec740bdb4d93f2da9b2db7\n 5dc3f\n\n```\n**Domains**\n\n```\nEkran Action\n                Spy\nUyghurs History Action\n                Spy\n\n```\n```\nDomain Description\nmisran[.]org Hosting PluginPhantom malware\napkprue[.]info Hosting PluginPhantom malware\nwww.apkpure[.]bz Hosting PluginPhantom malware\ngotossl[.]ml Hosting ActionSpy malware\ngeo2ipapi[.]org Hosting ActionSpy malware\nanayurt[.]net Hosting ActionSpy malware\npreservtyg[.]com Watering hole with malicious iframe\n\n```\n```\nuhtpuerdfbnm[.]c\nom\nuyghurhaber[.]co\nm\n\n```\n```\nWatering hole with malicious iframe\nWatering hole with malicious iframe\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nnewyorkingsite[.\n]com\nistiqlaihaber[.]\ncom\nuyghurnews[.]com\n\n```\n```\nWatering hole with malicious iframe\nWatering hole with malicious iframe\nWatering hole with malicious iframe\n\n```\n```\nstrunhvgpk[.]com Contained malicious javascript resembling previously reported\n           exploit code which installed INSOMNIA\n\n```\n```\nsslportservices[\n.]com\n\n```\n```\nConnected to infrastructure hosting malicious javascript\n\n```\n```\nplaygoog1e[.]com Believed to be used to host Android malware\nwww.apkhl[.]pw Believed to be used to host Android malware\n\n```\n```\nuyghur-softmarket[.]com\n\n```\n```\nBelieved to be used to host Android malware\n\n```\n```\nicptime[.]com Believed to be used to host Android malware\n\n```\n\n-----",
