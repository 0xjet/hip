This led to the wide adoption of\nMFA - from corporate accounts to social media profiles, almost all provide the option of\nenabling MFA, with many requiring it.\n\nThis means that, for attackers, stealing credentials or brute forcing passwords is no longer\nenough - if they don’t have access to victims’ multi-factor access token or code they will still\nnot be able to access their accounts. The increasing use of MFA means that attackers have\nhad to endeavor to find ways to bypass it, or avoid carrying out attacks that may be stalled\nby it. When we look at recent high-profile attacks, such as SolarWinds, the Microsoft\nExchange Server ProxyLogon attacks, and the vulnerabilities found in Pulse Secure VPN\nrecently, all these attacks help attackers avoid the hurdle of needing to overcome MFA.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile MFA has perhaps only gained wide adoption in the last couple of years, attacks\nattempting to bypass MFA [date as far back as 2011, when RSA Security was forced to](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790070/000119312511070159/dex991.htm)\nreplace 40 million SecurID tokens - which were used for MFA at the time - after the company\nwas hacked.\n\nHowever, recently, there have been some more notable examples of attacks that attempt to\neither bypass MFA, or eradicate the need to bypass it at all, with five of these outlined in this\nblog.\n\n## Recent zero-day vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN (CVE-2021-22893)\n\nOn April 20, 2021, Pulse Secure published an advisory warning about a zero-day remote\ncode execution vulnerability in its popular VPN product. On the same day, FireEye published\n[a blog detailing how the vulnerability (CVE-2021-22893) was being exploited by a China-](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22893)\nlinked APT group it tracks as UNC2630. FireEye said this group was attempting to leverage\nthe vulnerability in attacks targeting defense industrial base (DIB) targets in the U.S.\n\nThis new vulnerability was exploited, alongside a number of known Pulse Secure\nvulnerabilities, as the initial infection vector in these attacks. FireEye said that at least 12\nmalware families have been associated with exploit attempts against vulnerabilities in Pulse\nSecure. The malware was associated with what appears to be three threat actors, with\nattacks taking place in organizations in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nThe UNC2630 activity that was analyzed by FireEye demonstrated that successfully\nexploiting this vulnerability in the VPN software allowed attackers to Trojanize shared objects\nwith malicious code to log credentials and bypass authentication flows, including multi-factor\nauthentication requirements. FireEye said it was tracking this activity as SlowPulse. The\nattackers were also able to maintain persistence, inject web shells, and modify files.\n\nVPNs became a very popular target for hackers over the last year, as increased working\nfrom home due to the pandemic meant that workers were increasingly using VPNs to log into\ntheir corporate networks. If an attacker is able to compromise the VPN software - through a\nvulnerability like this - it negates a need for them to acquire anything more in the line of multifactor authentication.\n\nA [patch for this bug was issued on Monday (May 3), and all users of Pulse Secure should](https://blog.pulsesecure.net/pulse-connect-secure-patch-availability-sa44784/)\napply it quickly.\n\nSymantec has released Hacktool.Webshell and Hacktool.Atrium to block files believed to be\nrelated to this vulnerability.\n\n## Microsoft Exchange Server (ProxyLogon) attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nOn March 2, Microsoft released emergency patches for four zero-day vulnerabilities in\nMicrosoft Exchange Server that were being actively exploited by attackers in the wild. At the\ntime, Microsoft said these vulnerabilities were being exploited by an APT group it dubbed\nHafnium (Symantec tracks this group as Ant) in targeted attacks. However, it quickly became\napparent that multiple threat actors had started exploiting these vulnerabilities, with numbers\nrising rapidly once the existence of the vulnerabilities became public knowledge.\n\n[Two of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26855) [CVE-2021-27065) and the technique used](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27065)\n[to chain them together for exploitation were given the name “ProxyLogon”. Successful](https://proxylogon.com/)\nexploitation of these vulnerabilities allowed unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary\ncode on vulnerable Exchange Servers, allowing them to gain persistent system access,\naccess to files and mailboxes on the server, and access to credentials stored on the system.\nSuccessful exploitation may also allow attackers to compromise trust and identity in a\nvulnerable network. This gives attackers extensive access to infected networks, allowing\nthem to steal potentially highly sensitive information from victim organizations, without the\nneed to bypass any multi-factor authentication steps. In several instances the threat actors\nusing these vulnerabilities were seen stealing emails from victim inboxes.\n\nTo learn how Symantec helps protect you from these attacks, read our blog: How Symantec\n_Stops Microsoft Exchange Server Attacks_\n\n## SolarWinds\n\nThe SolarWinds attacks [were uncovered in December 2020, and have rarely been out of the](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/solarwinds/sunburst-supply-chain-attack-targets-solarwinds-users)\n[headlines since, with the U.S. recently announcing that it would be imposing sanctions](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/15/2002621240/-1/-1/0/CSA_SVR_TARGETS_US_ALLIES_UOO13234021.PDF/CSA_SVR_TARGETS_US_ALLIES_UOO13234021.PDF)\nagainst Russia as a response to the SolarWinds breach, as well as a number of other cyber\nattacks. The statement from U.S. officials said they had “high confidence” that the SVR, the\nRussian Foreign Intelligence Service - also known as APT29, Cozy Bear, The Dukes - was\nresponsible for the SolarWinds attack.\n\nThe SolarWinds incident is believed to have started in around March 2020, with any user of\nSolarWinds Orion software who downloaded an update between March and December 2020\nbelieved to have become infected with the first-stage malware, Backdoor.Sunburst. The\ninitial infection of victims was indiscriminate, but only a small number of those who\ndownloaded the initial compromised update saw additional malicious activity on their\nnetworks.\n\nThe motivation of the SolarWinds attackers was always believed to be information stealing,\nwith email appearing to be an area of particular interest to them. The attackers were also\nseen using various techniques to bypass MFA in the course of their attacks. In one incident,\n[security firm Veloxity said it saw the attackers using a novel technique to bypass 2FA](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/12/solarwinds-hackers-have-a-clever-way-to-bypass-multi-factor-authentication/)\nprovided by Duo, though the same technique would likely bypass MFA from any provider that\nrequires integration secrets stored in the potentially compromised environment. After gaining\nadministrator privileges on an infected network, the hackers used those rights to steal a Duo\n\n\n-----\n\nsecret known as an akey from a server running Outlook Web App (OWA), which\nenterprises use to provide account authentication for various network services. The hackers\nthen used the “akey” to generate a cookie, so they’d have it ready when someone with the\nright username and password would need it when taking over an account.\n\n[In another report, FireEye described the techniques it saw the attackers using. Among the](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/pdfs/wp-m-unc2452-2021-000343-01.pdf)\ntechniques FireEye saw were:\n\nAttackers stealing the Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) token-signing\ncertificate and using it to forge tokens for arbitrary users, which would allow the\nattacker to authenticate into a federated resource provider (such as Microsoft 365) as\nany user, without the need for that user’s password or MFA.\nModifying or adding trusted domains in Azure AD to add a new federated identity\nprovider (IdP) that the attacker controls. This would allow the attacker to forge tokens\nfor arbitrary users.\nCompromising the credentials of on-premises user accounts that are synchronized to\nMicrosoft 365 and are assigned high privileged directory roles, such as administrator.\nHijacking an existing Microsoft 365 application by adding a rogue credential to it in\norder to use the legitimate permissions assigned to the application, such as the ability\nto read email, send email as an arbitrary user, access user calendars, etc., while\nbypassing MFA.\n\nAttackers know they need a way to bypass or avoid MFA altogether if they want to access\nvictims’ email accounts, which still appears to be the goal of many sophisticated attackers,\nincluding state-sponsored actors like those behind SolarWinds.\n\nRead all our SolarWinds research, and how Symantec helps protect you, on our dedicated\nblog page.\n\n## Hackers targeting Iranian dissidents seek to steal 2FA text codes\n\nIn September 2020, Check Point published research on the Rampant Kitten hacking group,\nwhich it said had developed a new Android malware that was capable of intercepting and\nstealing 2FA codes sent via text. It is known that text 2FA is significantly less secure than\nusing an app or token - as tactics like SIM swapping (where a malicious actor gains access\nto your phone number) would allow codes to be intercepted - and many security experts\nthink neither organizations nor individuals should be using this kind of 2FA if there is another\noption.\n\nCheck Point said Rampant Kitten’s surveillance campaign had been ongoing for as long as\nsix years, targeting dissidents and minorities in Iran. The malware was hidden inside an app\nthat purported to be designed to help Iranian citizens get a Swedish driver's license.\nHowever, as well as harvesting contacts, old text messages, and recording using the\nmicrophone, the malicious app was also designed to look for SMS messages that contained\n\n\n-----\n\na G- string, which is a prefix used by Google as part of the two-factor authentication\nprocess. The attackers would send phishing messages to victims in order to harvest their\ncredentials, and would then also be able to access their 2FA codes and gain access to their\naccounts. The malware also forwarded all text messages to the attackers, meaning they\ncould bypass 2FA for any other apps or services using text message 2FA too.\n\n## Chinese attackers attempting to bypass 2FA\n\nBack in 2019, [FOX-IT blogged about a Chinese state-sponsored group - APT20 - that was](https://www.fox-it.com/en/news/whitepapers/operation-wocao-shining-a-light-on-one-of-chinas-hidden-hacking-groups/)\n[bypassing 2FA in its attacks. FOX-IT had been monitoring the attacker’s activity over a](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chinese-hacker-group-caught-bypassing-2fa/)\nperiod of two years, stating that it used living-off-the-land techniques to maintain a stealthy\npresence on victims’ networks in order to siphon off data for the purposes of espionage.\nFOX-IT found evidence the attackers had connected to VPN accounts that were protected by\n2FA, with the researchers theorizing that they did this by stealing an RSA SecurID software\ntoken from a hacked system, which they then used to generate valid one-time codes and\nbypass 2FA at will.\n\nAs FOX-IT explained at the time: “The software token is generated for a specific system, but\nof course this system specific value could easily be retrieved by the actor when having\naccess to the system of the victim.\n\n“As it turns out, the actor does not actually need to go through the trouble of obtaining the\nvictim's system specific value, because this specific value is only checked when importing\nthe SecurID Token Seed, and has no relation to the seed used to generate actual two-factor\ntokens. This means the actor can actually simply patch the check which verifies if the\nimported soft token was generated for this system, and does not need to bother with stealing\nthe system specific value at all.\n\n“In short, all the actor has to do to make use of the two-factor authentication codes is to steal\nan RSA SecurID Software Token and to patch one instruction, which results in the generation\nof valid tokens.”\n\n## Worrying trend\n\nWhile it has been known for some time that some advanced persistent threat (APT) groups\nand sophisticated actors were able to bypass MFA in some instances, the recent\nsophisticated attacks that appear to have bypassing these kinds of protections as one of\ntheir main goals provides a reminder no single solution is sufficient.\n\nFortunately, these attacks also show MFA is working as attackers need to go to great lengths\nto find alternative means to breach MFA-protected organizations. Organizations should take\nadditional steps to increase protection, such as:\n\nAuditing login and Active Directory events\n\n\n-----\n\nReviewing and reducing services and accounts that do not require MFA\nKeeping up to date on patches for any discovered vulnerabilities\nConsidering a threat model where MFA may be bypassed or on-site secrets may be\ncompromised\nExpanding their zero trust architecture beyond simple 2FA.\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
