Unlike most of the group’s\nmalware, MQsTTang doesn’t seem to be based on existing families or publicly available projects.\n\n[Mustang Panda is known for its customized Korplug variants (also dubbed PlugX) and elaborate loading chains. In a](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/)\ndeparture from the group’s usual tactics, MQsTTang has only a single stage and doesn’t use any obfuscation techniques.\n\n## Victimology\n\nWe have seen unknown entities in Bulgaria and Australia in our telemetry. We also have information indicating that this\ncampaign is targeting a governmental institution in Taiwan. However, due to the nature of the decoy filenames used, we\nbelieve that political and governmental organizations in Europe and Asia are also being targeted. This would also be in line\n[with the targeting of the group’s other recent campaigns. As documented by fellow researchers at Proofpoint, Mustang Panda](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european)\nhas been known to target European governmental entities since at least 2020 and has increased its activity in Europe even\nfurther, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Figure 1 shows our view of the targeting for this campaign.\n\n_Figure 1. Map showing known and suspected targets of MQsTTang_\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nWe attribute this new backdoor and the campaign to Mustang Panda with high confidence based on the following indicators.\n\nWe found archives containing samples of MQsTTang in two GitHub repositories belonging to the user YanNaingOo0072022.\nAnother GitHub repository of the same user was used in a previous Mustang Panda campaign described by Avast in a\n[December 2022 blogpost.](https://decoded.avast.io/threatintel/apt-treasure-trove-avast-suspects-chinese-apt-group-mustang-panda-is-collecting-data-from-burmese-government-agencies-and-opposition-groups/)\n\nOne of the servers used in the current campaign was running a publicly accessible anonymous FTP server that seems to be\nused to stage tools and payloads. In the /pub/god directory of this server there are multiple Korplug loaders, archives, and\ntools that were used in previous Mustang Panda campaigns. This is the same directory that was used by the stager described\nin the aforementioned Avast blogpost. This server also had a /pub/gd directory, which was another path used in that\ncampaign.\n\nSome of the infrastructure used in this campaign also matches the network fingerprint of previously known Mustang Panda\nservers.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nMQsTTang is a barebones backdoor that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a victim’s machine and get\n[the output. Even so, it does present some interesting characteristics. Chief among these is its use of the MQTT protocol for](https://mqtt.org/)\nC&C communication. MQTT is typically used for communication between IoT devices and controllers, and the protocol\nhasn’t been used in many publicly documented malware families. One such example is Chrysaor, also known as Pegasus for\nAndroid. From an attacker’s perspective, one of MQTT’s benefits is that it hides the rest of their infrastructure behind a\nbroker. Thus, the compromised machine never communicates directly with the C&C server. As seen in Figure 2, this\n[capability is achieved by using the open source QMQTT library. This library depends on the Qt framework, a large part of](https://github.com/emqx/qmqtt)\nwhich is statically linked in the malware. Using the Qt framework for malware development is also fairly uncommon.\n[Lazarus’s MagicRAT is one of the rare recently documented examples.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-magicrat/)\n\n_Figure 2. RTTI showing classes from the QMQTT library_\n\nMQsTTang is distributed in RAR archives which only contain a single executable. These executables usually have names\nrelated to Diplomacy and passports such as:\n\nCVs Amb Officer PASSPORT Ministry Of Foreign Affairs.exe\nDocuments members of delegation diplomatic from Germany.Exe\nPDF Passport and CVs of diplomatic members from Tokyo of JAPAN eXE\n\n\n-----\n\nNote No.18 NG 23 from Embassy of Japan.exe\n\nThese archives are hosted on a web server with no associated domain name. This fact, along with the filenames, leads us to\nbelieve that the malware is spread via spearphishing.\n\nSo far, we have only observed a few samples. Besides variations in some constants and hardcoded strings, the samples are\nremarkably similar. The only notable change is the addition of some anti-analysis techniques in the latest versions. The first\nof these consists of using the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Windows API function to iterate through running processes and\nlook for the following known debuggers and monitoring tools.\n\ncheatengine-x86_64.exe\nollydbg.exe\nida.exe\nida64.exe\nradare2.exe\nx64dbg.exe\nprocmon.exe\nprocmon64.exe\nprocexp.exe\nprocesshacker.exe\npestudio.exe\nsystracerx32.exe\nfiddler.exe\ntcpview.exe\n\nNote that, while the malware is a 32-bit executable, it only checks for the presence of x64dbg and not its 32-bit counterpart,\nx32dbg.\n\nThe second technique uses the FindWindowW Windows API to look for the following Window Classes and Titles used by\nknown analysis tools:\n\nPROCMON_WINDOW_CLASS\nOLLYDBG\nWinDbgFrameClass\nOllyDbg – [CPU]\nImmunity Debugger – [CPU]\n\nWhen executed directly, the malware will launch a copy of itself with 1 as a command line argument. This is repeated by the\nnew process, with the argument being incremented by 1 on every run. When this argument hits specific values, certain tasks\nwill be executed. Note that the exact values vary between samples; the ones mentioned below correspond to the sample with\nSHA-1 02D95E0C369B08248BFFAAC8607BBA119D83B95B. However, the tasks themselves and the order in which they are\nexecuted is constant.\n\nFigure 3 shows an overview of this behavior along with the tasks that are executed when the malware is first run.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Execution graph showing the subprocesses and executed tasks_\n\nTable 1 contains a list of the tasks and the value at which each of them is executed. We will describe them in further detail in\nthe upcoming paragraphs.\n\n_Table 1. Tasks executed by the backdoor_\n\n**Task number** **Argument value** **Task description**\n\n1 **5** Start C&C communication.\n\n2 **9** Create copy and launch.\n\n3 **32** Create persistence copy.\n\n4 **119** Establish persistence.\n\n5 **148** Stop recursive execution.\n\nIf any analysis tool or debugger is detected using the techniques we described previously, the behavior of task 1 is altered and\ntasks 2, 3, and 4 are skipped entirely.\n\n### Task 1: C&C communication\n\nAs was previously mentioned, MQsTTang communicates with its C&C server over the MQTT protocol. All observed samples\nuse 3.228.54.173 as broker. This server is a public broker operated by EMQX, who also happen to be the maintainers of the\nQMQTT library. This could be a way to make the network traffic seem legitimate and to hide Mustang Panda’s own\ninfrastructure. Using this public broker also provides resiliency; the service is unlikely to be taken down because of its many\nlegitimate users and, even if the current C&C servers are banned or taken down, Mustang Panda could spin up new ones and\nuse the same MQTT topics without disrupting MQsTTang’s operation.\n\nHowever, this campaign could also be a test case by Mustang Panda before deciding whether to invest the time and resources\nto set up their own broker. This is supported by the low number of samples we’ve observed and the very simple nature of\nMQsTTang.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, the malware and C&C server use two MQTT topics for their communication. The first one, iot/server2,\nis used for communication from the client to the server. The second one is used for communication from the server to the\nclient. It follows the format iot/v2/<Unique ID> where <Unique ID> is generated by taking the last 8 bytes, in hex form, of a\nUUID. If any analysis tool is detected, server2 and v2 are respectively replaced with server0 and v0. This is likely in order to\navoid tipping off defenders by entirely aborting the malware’s execution early.\n\n_Figure 4. Simplified network graph of the communication between the backdoor and C&C server_\n\nAll communication between the server and the client uses the same encoding scheme. The MQTT message’s payload is a\nJSON object with a single attribute named msg. To generate the value of this attribute, the actual content is first base64\nencoded, then XORed with the hardcoded string nasa, and base64 encoded again. We will describe the exact format of these\npayloads in the relevant sections.\n\nUpon first connecting to the broker, the malware subscribes to its unique topic. Then, and every 30 seconds thereafter, the\nclient publishes a KeepAlive message to the server’s topic. The content of this message is a JSON object with the following\nformat:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n{\n\n\"Alive\": \"<malware’s uptime in minutes>\",\n\n\"c_topic\": \"<client’s unique topic>\"\n\n}\n\n\nWhen the server wants to issue a command, it publishes a message to the client’s unique topic. The plaintext content of this\nmessage is simply the command to be executed. As shown in Figure 5, the client executes the received command using\nQProcess::startCommand from the Qt framework. The output, obtained using QProcess::readAllStandardOutput, is then sent\nback in a JSON object with the following format:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n{\n\n\"c_topic\": \"<client’s unique topic>\",\n\n\"ret\": \"<Command output>\"\n\n}\n\n_Figure 5. Execution of received commands using the QProcess class_\n\n\nSince only the content of standard output is sent back, the server will not receive errors or warnings. From the server’s point\nof view, a failed command is thus indistinguishable from a command that simply produces no output unless some sort of\nredirection is performed.\n\n### Tasks 2 and 3: Copying the malware\n\nThe second and third tasks are fairly similar to each other. They copy the malware’s executable to a hardcoded path;\nc:\\users\\public\\vdump.exe and c:\\users\\public\\vcall.exe respectively. The filenames used are different for each sample, but\nthey are always located in the C:\\users\\public directory.\n\nIn the second task, the newly created copy is then launched with the command line argument 97.\n\n### Task 4: Establishing persistence\n\nPersistence is established by the fourth task, which creates a new value qvlc set to c:\\users\\public\\vcall.exe under the\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run registry key. This will cause the malware to be executed on\nstartup.\n\nWhen MQsTTang is executed on startup as c:\\users\\public\\vcall.exe, only the C&C communication task is executed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Mustang Panda campaign described in this article is ongoing as of this writing. The victimology is unclear, but the decoy\nfilenames are in line with the group’s other campaigns that target European political entities.\n\nThis new MQsTTang backdoor provides a kind of remote shell without any of the bells and whistles associated with the\ngroup’s other malware families. However, it shows that Mustang Panda is exploring new technology stacks for its tools. It\nremains to be seen whether this backdoor will become a recurring part of the group’s arsenal, but it is one more example of\nthe group’s fast development and deployment cycle.\n\n_ESET Research offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.
