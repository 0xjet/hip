Once installed, malicious\nactors will use SDBBot to move laterally within a network and exfiltrate data. SDBBot is a\nknown precursor of the Clop ransomware.\n\nWhile the recently observed activity is targeting the health sector, the ACSC recommends\nthat all network owners review their controls against ransomware as per ACSC’s publication\n[Ransomware in Australia.](https://www.cyber.gov.au/node/2889)\n\n\n-----",
