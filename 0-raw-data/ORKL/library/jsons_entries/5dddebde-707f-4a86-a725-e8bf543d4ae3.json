We came across this operation while monitoring other targeted attack campaigns,[1,2] and\nwhat caught our interest, apart from its highly targeted nature, is the lack of sophistication in the\ntools and tactics it used.\n\nApart from using email and social engineering as entry point, this operation exploits a relatively\nold vulnerability, uses a malware that can easily be decompiled for a researcher to map out its\nnetwork infrastructure, and has command-and-control (C&C) servers with open directories\nwhere exfiltrated data can be accessed and analyzed. Compared to its contemporaries, in terms\nof technique this targeted attack campaign is amateur at best, sloppy at worst. Despite this, it\nwas able to get at least 16 gigabytes’ worth of data from 160 targets.\n\nOur analysis also leads us to believe that the attackers are located in Pakistan, although there is\nno evidence to suggest this attack is tied to the Pakistani government. We also have reason to\nbelieve that this operation also goes for information found in mobile devices of its targets.\n\nThis technical brief provides a detailed look into the operation: its targets, its tools and its\ntactics.\n\n## The attack\n\nLike most targeted attacks, the actors behind this campaign use email as their point of entry. As\nin most targeted attacks, the attackers have a very good idea what the individual targets are\ninterested in, what subjects they are most likely to click on, and use this to their advantage.\nBelow is a sample email from this group, which was sent to the military attaché of a foreign\ncountry who was assigned to India:\n\n1 Proofpoint, Inc. (2016). Threat Insight Blog. “Operation Transparent Tribe - APT Targeting Indian Diplomatic and Military\n[Interests.” Last accessed March 23, 2016. https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Operation-Transparent-Tribe](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Operation-Transparent-Tribe)\n2 Cloudsek (2015). “Crimeware / APT Malware Masquerade as Santa Claus and Christmas Apps.” Last accessed March 23, 2016\n[https://www.cloudsek.com/announcements/blog/apt-malware-masquerade-as-christmas-apps-and-santa-claus/](https://www.cloudsek.com/announcements/blog/apt-malware-masquerade-as-christmas-apps-and-santa-claus/)\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the PDF files are opened using Adobe Acrobat Reader, an exploit is triggered which drops\na malicious Windows executable file—a Trojan—which then connects to and communicates\nwith the C&C server. The main features of this Trojan are keylogging and password theft;\nhowever, the attackers, upon their request, can also make it record audio, steal any amount of\nfiles, or take screenshots. Invariably, after a few minutes, the server instructs the infected client\nto upload the keystroke log.\n\nWe assume that the attackers would use these logs to determine if the affected system is\ninteresting enough that they need to perform more actions against it. More technical information\nabout the binary and the C&C communication protocol can be found in the appendix below.\n\nThe malware is also compiled into a Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) binary using\nVisual Studio. This means that: 1) the original source code was probably VB# (Visual Basic\n.NET) or C# (.NET version of C++), and; 2) the developers don’t know (or didn’t care) that these\nprograms can be easily decompiled. This shows an unusual case of targeted information theft\nwhere the attackers are providing the source code for free. This implies that the threat actors\nresponsible for it are not very sophisticated, not knowledgeable, or both.\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors’ command-and-control (C&C) servers have open directories, and from there\nwe were also able to identify Microsoft Office files related to several other campaigns against\nother Indian targets:\n\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n## The targets\n\nWe found three open directories on the C&C servers associated with this operation.\n\nThese directories contained more than 16 gigabytes’ worth of the targets’ data, and a careful\nanalysis of the 160 records found in these directories gave us a good idea of the kind of people\nthe attackers were after. The majority of them belonged to officers of the Indian army, although\nwe identified some as IT consultants and/or resellers. The data that were exfiltrated from these\npeople included:\n\nPassport scans and other photo IDs\nSalary and taxation data (Indian army PDF payslips)\nArmy strategic and tactical documents\nArmy training documentation\nPersonal photos\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nThe personal data of the targets identified them as brigadiers, colonels, lieutenant colonels,\nmajors, and lieutenants.\n\n## Command-and-control (C&C) servers\n\nThe malware connects to a single C&C server hardcoded into the malicious binary. Different\ncampaigns use different C&C servers and ports. Here are some of the servers in use:\n\n  - 178.238.235.143:9999\n\n  - 213.136.79.50:80\n\n  - 80.240.134.51:80\n\n  - 82.196.13.94:80\n\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\n  - 93.104.213.217:1337\n\n  - 95.85.43.35:9999\n\nUsing reverse DNS, we were able to find associated domain names for the above IP addresses,\nas follows:\n\n  - 93.104.213.217 – vmi22485.contabo.host – Contabo is the ISP hosting this server.\n\n  - 95.85.43.35 – bbmsync2727.com\n\n  - 213.136.79.50 – bluesync2121.com\n\n  - 82.196.13.94 – pradahandbagsshoes.com\n\n  - 178.238.235.143 – vdjunky.org – also m1343.contabo.host\n\n  - 80.240.134.51 – ordering-checks.com\n\nOlder C&C servers give us the following information, too:\n\n  - bhai1.ddns.net:3050 (182.185.110.142) – This IP is hosted in Pakistan.\n\nEspecially interesting for us is the domain vdjunky.org. It was registered with the email address\n_akml614@yahoo.com. This address was also used to register other malicious domains, as_\nfollows:\n\n  - Idnnews.net (91.194.91.202)\n\n  - Mpjunkie.com (193.164.131.225)\n\n  - Pbxmobiflex.com (178.238.230.88)\n\nIn addition, we found five more domains with a familiar pattern, the same as some of the C&C\nservers listed above. In fact, all of them are, or have been, C&C servers.\n\n  - Applemedia1218.com (213.136.79.50)\n\n  - Avssync3357.com (213.136.79.50)\n\n  - Bluesync2121.com (213.136.79.50)\n\n  - Eastmedia2112.com (75.98.175.79 and 213.136.79.50)\n\n  - Mvssync8767.com (213.136.79.50)\n\nIf we look at the first three domain names along with our original vdjunky.org, we see more\ninteresting things too: pbxmobiflex.com was used as the C&C server of an Android spying app.\nThis mobile malware can read the affected user’s SMS and listen to phone conversations. We\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\nsuspect that malicious apps running on iOS and Blackberry may also connect to this same\nserver, presumably used in similar spying campaigns.\n\nWhile it is possible that the Windows and mobile malware are owned by different actors who are\nonly sharing a hosted server, at least one news article[3] from Indian media reports that this very\nserver was used to spy on Android users from the Indian army. Chances are that the same\nactors are behind both operations.\n\nIn addition, we found that a server connected with this group, 93.104.213.217, is actually a live\nC&C for a Windows .EXE file called “NATO soldier killed in firefight between US_ Afghan\n_forces.exe”. This same server also acts as the C&C for an off-the-shelf Android malware called_\nSandrorat. We believe that there is a definite connection between the Android malware, these\nactors, and their spying campaigns against India.\n\n## The Pakistani connection\n\nAlthough we cannot be 100% certain who is behind the operation and exactly where it is coming\nfrom, there are certain clues that point to it with a high probability. First, the Indian army is\ntargeted by both the Android and Windows versions of this malware. The older C&C servers of\nthis malware were located in Pakistan until they were moved to Internet service providers (ISPs)\nin Western countries. The new C&C servers seem to be administered by somebody located in\nPakistan.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that malware samples from this group get a lot of rescans on\nVirusTotal by the same user ID from Pakistan. The picture this paints becomes clearer: threat\nactors (without much training or resources) located in Pakistan are responsible for attacks\nagainst targets predominantly tied to the Indian Army.\n\nThese actors send emails to high-ranking officers with relevant social engineering techniques,\nand are intent on stealing information. Additionally, there is evidence that these same attackers\ninfect mobile phones of Indian army officers with spyware that steals communication data.\n\n3 IBN Khabar (2016). “सबसे बड़ापऱ्ााफ़ाश, 200 फौजियों की हर ि़ानक़ारी प़ाककस्त़ान के प़ास!” Last accessed, March 23, 2016.\n[http://khabar.ibnlive.com/news/desh/more-than-200-army-personnels-under-pakistani-honey-trap-460616.html](http://khabar.ibnlive.com/news/desh/more-than-200-army-personnels-under-pakistani-honey-trap-460616.html)\n\n[article in Hindi]\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen one thinks of targeted attacks, the first thought always goes to bigger countries with big\nbudgets and very tight well-thought-out operations. As Operation C-Major shows, smaller\nplayers are in this game, too, and what they may lack in technical sophistication, they make up\nfor through tenacity, persistence and clever social engineering.\n\nFor those in charge of defending a corporate or organization network, this attack reinforces the\nfact that any user, regardless of rank or position, is susceptible in becoming the organization’s\nweakest security link. As such, while network defenders should be prepared to help prevent, or\nminimize the damage of attacks, people who use the said network should likewise be\nknowledgeable of threats that could possibly come. The need for proper user awareness\ntraining is clear.\n\nIn the same way that there are different levels of cybercriminals with varying levels of\nsophistication, the same thing applies to threat actors and info-stealing attacks. Methods of\ndefense in the technological realm are, of course, recommended—one could say they are a\nmust nowadays—but do not underestimate plain social engineering attacks on the basis that\nonly cybercriminals lurk behind all malicious attachments.\n\nThe attackers don't need to be high-tech in order to conduct a successful targeted attack\noperation and in cases such as these, the same thing can be said of a successful defense.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Technical Features\n\nThe malware used in the operation is an information-stealing Trojan. Its main purpose seems to\nbe obtaining and exfiltrating information from the target Windows computer and uploading it to\nan external server. Although it is flexible in what it can do, by observing the ways it is being\ninstalled in its targets, we believe this to be a targeted operation.\n\nBased on how this Trojan was programmed and compiled, it’s highly doubtful that it came from\na well-funded organization. Rather, it appears that a modest, low-profile developer team or even\na single programmer created it.\n\nThe strings within the malware code are in English, although the amount of misspellings point to\na non-native English speaker. The EXE seems to have been compiled in Visual Studio and\nprogrammed in VB#. Therefore, the final product is a .NET binary that has not been obfuscated,\nand the original function names and variables are kept as they were written. This makes\nanalysis much easier.\n\n### Main program\n\nThe main program’s internal name is msdocuments but the attackers rename it depending on\nthe social engineering theme used against the target. We have observed names like\n_securescan.exe and wservices.exe. The original internal version we analyzed was 1.0.0.0,_\nwhich implements a primitive communication protocol with the C&C server that only supports\nupdates. This communication happens through a high TCP port; ports 1337, 9990, 9999 and\nothers have been observed. Once the client connects for the first time to the server, it stays\nquiet. Then the server responds with a string: “info=command”, which the client does not\nimmediately reply to. After a brief moment, the client starts sending the following command:\n\nupdatc=<user>  |  <machine>  | WINDOWS  <AV_installed>\n\nIn this command, the client is requesting an update for the infected computer. <user> refers to\nthe logged in user name and <machine> to the hostname of the infected PC. “WINDOWS” is a\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\nhardcoded string, although we have not seen other OS ports of this Trojan. <AV installed> is a\nkey string that the client assigns based on an analysis of the process list. If no active antivirus\nprogram is found, this string is “Not.Found”. Otherwise, there are a few strings, like\n“[Kaspersky]”, “[Symantec]”, “[Microsoft-Security-Essentials]” or a generic “[Anti-Malware”].\nTrend Micro is not on the list, although an Indian vendor's AV is: “[Quick-Heal]”. Perhaps this is\na reflection of the AV market share of the region the developer is from or where the expected\ntarget might be.\n\nThe reply to the update request coming from the server is the following:\n\nupdatc=client=\\wservices.exe<BINARY>\n\nThis binary is an updated version of the main program, which will replace the older version. The\nmalware writes the new version to disk and starts it up.\n\nThe new malware sample has a version number 1.0.0.6 and the communication protocol is\nmuch more comprehensive. Whereas the old one had only three commands (updatec, info, and\n_upsecs), this new one supports 40._\n\nThe downloader program seems to be the spearhead part of the attack, but the new version\nlooks like the real client. Each of the EXEs in this attack group seem to have an internal name\nassigned to them. In this case, the downloader’s is DOSERS and the main client program’s is\n_FORYUO”. This string will later be used as a prefix of each command, perhaps to identify the_\nversion of the client.\n\nOnce the new client starts up, it establishes again a TCP connection with the same server and\nport and stays quiet. As usual, the server responds with an “info=command”, which the client\ndoesn’t immediately respond to. The client then sends a full info command, telling the server\nmore information. This is the command observed:\n\nFORYUOR-info=user <MAC>|<hostname>|<user>|<OS>|<version>|<AV_installed>|\nFORYUOR-uklog>\nFORYUOR-sndps>\nFORYUOR-secup>\nFORYUOR-audio>\nFORYUOR-usbdiv>\nFORYUOR-sapp=httpscan<\\Scaner\\>\nFORYUOR-kapp=svehost<\\services\\>\nFORYUOR-uapp=udriver<\\Drivers\\>\nFORYUOR-papp=servicescan<\\services\\>\nFORYUOR-mapp=httpservice<\\Windows Data\\>||c:\\Documents and\nSettings\\user\\Application Data\\Windows Data\\\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\n<MAC> refers to the MAC address of the network card used to connect. <version> refers to the\nclient version. In our sample, this was “Microsoft-1.0.0.6”. The rest of the fields point to the\nmany modular components of the attack. “uklog” refers to the keylogger binary, “sndps” to the\nsound binary, “secup” to the backup client process, “audio” to the audio driver and “usbdi” to the\nfilestealing module. On first call, this set of commands is empty, as shown above, although the\ndirectory paths assigned to them are already decided and set up by the client program. The\npath where each of them will reside, are sent in the last few lines (the commands “sapp” (the\nbackup program), “kapp” (the keylogger), “uapp” (the file stealing module), “papp” (a password\nstealing module not requested although the path is already set up) and “mapp” (the main\napplication).\n\nThe response to this message coming from the C&C server brings all the binaries that the client\nhas requested (keylogger, sound module, audio driver, filestealing module and backup module):\n\nuclntn=98\nuklog=loger=\\svshost.exe<BINARY>\nsecup=client=\\servicescan.exe<BINARY>\naudio=mcaudio=\\Naudio.dll<BINARY>\nupdate=usbdriver=\\udriver.exe<BINARY>\n\nThe TCP connection is left open and the C&C server will be sending a ping command at\nspecified intervals to keep it that way:\n\nclping=Ping\n\nOther commands supported by the 1.0.0.6 version of the clients shed more light on what the\npurpose of this threat really is. Here is a list of all the commands and a brief explanation of their\nfunctionality:\n\n  - afile: Functionality not identified\n\n  - audio: Updates the audio driver\n\n  - clping: Sets last communication time to current time\n\n  - clrklg: Stops and deletes the keylogger module\n\n  - cnls: Enables “Cnls” capability\n\n  - cscreen: Takes screenshot and uploads it to server\n\n  - delt: Deletes a file on disk\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\n- dirs: Lists drives in the system, then uploads results to server\n\n- dowf: Downloads a file from the server\n\n- dowr: Downloads a remote executable file and runs it\n\n- endpo: It quits the main program\n\n- file: Uploads a file to the server\n\n- filsz: Provides filesize\n\n- fldr: Lists folders on disk, then uploads it to server\n\n- fles: Searches files on disk\n\n- info: Sends pc info (MAC, user, hostname, AV, etc.)\n\n- klgs: No functionality. Possibly a remnant of an older version.\n\n- listf: Looks for files with certain extensions on any disk\n\n- mesg: Send a message to the user. It displays a MessageBox\n\n- passl: Runs password logger, then uploads results to server\n\n- procl: Lists all windows processes and uploads the results to server\n\n- runf: Runs an executable in a separate process\n\n- rupth: Sends back the path where the main program is located\n\n- savaf: Saves a remote file to the infected PC\n\n- scren: Takes a screenshot\n\n- scrsz: Sets screenshot size\n\n- secup: Updates the backup module\n\n- sndpl: Updates password logger, runs it and uploads results to server\n\n- sndps: Updates password stealing module\n\n- splitr: Splits a file in pieces. Possibly to steal bigger files more efficiently.\n\n- stops: Disables screenshot capability\n\n- stpre: Stops audio recording\n\n- stsre: Starts audio recording\n\n- sysky: Uploads keylogs to server\n\n- thumb: Saves an image to disk (of the current application, possibly)\n\n- uclntn: Sets a version number in the registry. It looks like a sequential number\n\n- udlt: Downloads a \"remove user\" module and runs it\n\n- uklog: Updates the keylogger module\n\n- updatc: Updates main module\n\n- updatu or usbwrm: Updates file stealing module\n\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n### Malware hashes involved in the attacks\n\n  -
