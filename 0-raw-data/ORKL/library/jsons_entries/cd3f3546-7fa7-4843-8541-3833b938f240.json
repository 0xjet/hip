Messages that appear legitimate\nand specific fool us more often than random phishing attempts. Exploits that use patched\nvulnerabilities delivered via spear phishing email are one of the most successful\ncombinations used by attackers to infiltrate targeted organizations and gain access to\nconfidential information.\n\nDuring the last month, McAfee Labs researchers have uncovered targeted attacks carried\nout via spear phishing email against a French company. We have seen email sent to a large\ngroup of individuals in the organization. The attachments exploit the recently patched RTF\nvulnerability CVE-2014-1761 and the previously patched ActiveX control vulnerability CVE2012-0158. Both of these vulnerabilities have been popular in several ongoing targeted\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n\\\n\nThe preceding spear\nphishing emails come\nfrom attackers using the\nFrench Yahoo and\nLaposte email services\nand possibly\nimpersonating\nemployees of the\ntargeted organization.\n\n## RTF Vulnerability\n\nThese exploits target the recently discovered RTF zero-day vulnerability CVE-2014-1761.\nThe flaw lies in the value of the “ListOverrideCount,” which is set to 25.\n\nHowever,\naccording to\nMicrosoft’s RTF\nspecifications\nthis value\nshould be\neither 1 or 9. This error eventually causes an out-of-bounds array overwrite that results in\nincorrect handling of the structure by Word and leads to the attacker’s controlling an\nextended instruction pointer (EIP).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shellcode\n\nMcAfee Labs researchers discovered that all the bytes of the shellcode, the return oriented\nprogramming (ROP) chain, are directly controlled by the attacker and come straight from the\nRTF structure. Here is a high-level view of how the ROP chain is formed:\n\nNext we see a\nsnapshot of the\nparsed RTF\nstructure in\nmemory leading to\nthe control of the\nEIP:\n\nSuccessful\nexecution of the\nshellcode opens\nthe decoy\ndocument and\ndrops the malware\nsvohost.exein the\n\n%TEMP%directoryandthen connects to the control server.\n\n[(McAfee Labs researchers Haifei Li and Xie Jun have already blogged on the technical](https://mcafee.com/blogs/others/mcafee-labs/close-look-rtf-zero-day-attack-cve-2014-1761-shows-sophistication-attackers/)\ndetails of the vulnerability and the shellcode.)\n\nIn this cycle of spear phishing attacks we’ve also seen email targeting the same organization\nwith attachments that exploit the two-year-old CVE -2012-0158 vulnerability. The malicious\npayload arrives in the innocuous-sounding article.doc.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following API trace gives an\nidea of the sequence of activities\nonce the exploit is launched on the\nsystem:\n\n**Payload Analysis**\n\nOur analysis of the dropped binary\nreveals that it was specifically\n\nwritten to\ngather\ninformation\nabout the\nnetwork of\nthe target\norganization\nas well as\nthe\nconfiguration\nof the\nendpoint—\nleading us to\nbelieve that\nthis is a\nspear\n\nphishing\n\nreconnaissance. The payload seems to have been compiled on April 9:\n\nThe malware starts by retrieving the %Temp% path and prepares to log the communication\nwith its control server in the file %Temp%explorer.exe.\n\nSubsequently, the malware collecting following information:\n\nHostname\nUsername\nSystem type by resolving IsWOW64Process AP\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrent TCP and UDP\nconnections and open ports\nOrganizational\ninformation from the\nregistry key:\n\nHKLM/Software/Microsoft/WindowsNT/CurrentVersion,\nProductname,\nCSDVersion,\nCurrentVersion,\nCurrentBuildNumber,\nRegisteredOrganization,\nRegisteredOwner\nCurrent running system services\nInstalled software from the registry key:\n\nHKLM/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Uninstall\nInformation about network adapters, IP configuration, netcard numbers, IP mask,\ngateway, DHCP server, DHCP host, WINS server, and WINS host\n\nHere is a high-level snapshot of the malware’s information gathering code:\n\n\n-----\n\nEncryption is primarily done using the SYSTEMTIME structure. It forms the repetitive 256byte key using SYSTEMTIME information, shown below:\n\nThe\nmalware\nconverts\nthe key\ninto 16\nbytes to\n\n\n-----\n\nencrypt the information.\n\nOnce the buffer has been encrypted, it connects to the control server\nsophos.skypetm.com.tw.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Command and Control Research\n\nDuring our analysis of this exploit, sophos.skypetm.com.tw resolved to the IP address\n66.220.4.100. located in the Fremont, California. McAfee sensors first observed the\noutbound traffic to this domain on January 27, at which time it resolved to 198.100.113.27,\nlocated in Los Angeles.\n\nFrom our passive DNS data, we found following MD5 hashes connecting to the same\ndomain resolving to 198.100.113.27.\n\n4ab74387f7a02c115deea2110f961fd3 January 27, 2014 sophos.skypetm.com.tw\n\n8dc8e02e06ca7c825d42d82ec19d8377 January 28, 2014 sophos.skypetm.com.tw\n\n0331417d7fc3d075128da1353ae880d8 March 30, 2014 sophos.skypetm.com.tw\n\n5e2360a8c4a0cce1ae22919d8bff49fd April 25, 2014 sophos.skypetm.com.tw\n\nThe whois record reveals that the skypetm.com.tw domain has been registered under the\nemail ID longsa33@yahoo.com. This ID also registered the domain avstore.com.tw, which\nhas been used as the control server.\n\nWe\nhave\nseen\n\nseveral other malware binaries communicating with the various subdomains of\nskypetm.com.tw and avstore.com.tw. All of them have been identified as “PittyTiger”\nmalware, which appears in numerous CVE-2012-0158 exploits used in recent targeted\nattacks. The same payload was used in the “Tomato Garden” APT campaign, uncovered in\nJune 2013, against Tibetan and Chinese democracy activists.\n\n\n-----\n\n65809985e57b9143a24ac57cccde8c77 asdf.skypetm.com.tw 113.10.240.54\n\nvbnm.skypetm.com.tw 122.10.39.52\n\nc0656b66b9f4180e59e1fd2f9f1a85f2 zeng.skypetm.com.tw 113.10.221.126\n\nb84342528942cec03f5f2976294613ba gmail.skypetm.com.tw 122.208.59.188\n\nd4f96dba1900d53f1d33ee66f7e5996d gmail.skypetm.com.tw 122.208.59.188\n\nb84342528942cec03f5f2976294613ba gmail.skypetm.com.tw:8080 122.208.59.188\n\nd4f96dba1900d53f1d33ee66f7e5996d gmail.skypetm.com.tw:8080 122.208.59.188\n\n2be9fc56017aab1827bd30c9b2e3fc27 jamessmith.avstore.com.tw 58.64.175.191\n\nbe18418cafdb9f86303f7e419a389cc9 chanxe.avstore.com.tw 122.10.48.189\n\n65809985e57b9143a24ac57cccde8c77 asdf.avstore.com.tw 122.10.39.105\n\n17bc87b13b0a26caa2eb9a0d2a23fc72 bluer.avstore.com.tw 58.64.185.200\n\n90f3973578ec9e2da4fb7f22da744e4c avast.avstore.com.tw 198.100.121.15\n\nAdditional domains related to this attack:\n\n- 63.251.83.36\n\n- 64.74.96.242\n\n- 69.251.142.1\n\n- 218.16.121.32\n\n- 61.145.112.78\n\n- star.yamn.net\n\n- 216.52.184.230\n\n- 212.118.243.118\n\n- bz.kimoo.com.tw\n\n- mca.avstore.com.tw\n\n**McAfee Product Coverage**\n\n\n-----\n\n[McAfee coverage for CVE 2014-1761 is detailed here.
