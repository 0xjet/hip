With all of the calamity of 2020, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic\nand the numerous protests in the United States and elsewhere, attackers are leveraging the\nglobal news cycle to lure unsuspecting victims to download and open malicious\nattachments.\n\nThe campaign uses a variety of subject lines for emails with an attached malicious Microsoft\nWord document to compel the user into opening the attachment. The content of the body is\nwritten in haste and uses poor grammar, but the Black Lives Matter subject is used to compel\n\n\n-----\n\nvictims into opening the attachment:\n\n_Leave a review confidentially about [various Black Lives Matter subjects]_\n_Claim in attached file_\n\nThese emails utilize variations in subjects and sender names to either circumvent spam\nfilters or to simply create confusion. An example of the variety of subjects and senders being\nused is shown below:\n\nFigure 1. Variants of Black Lives Matter Spam and Subject lines\n\n## Technical Details of the Malicious Spam Campaign Using Black Lives Matter to Lure Victims\n\nThe attachment is a standard Microsoft Word document with a generic image enticing the\nuser to enable macros.\n\nFigure 2. Image in Word Document Compelling User to Enable Macros.\n\nWhen we try to examine the macro, we find that it is protected by a password, as is the case\nwith many malicious documents. This adds an additional layer of protection to prevent casual\nanalysis. And after extracting the macro, we also see that an obfuscated string is used to\nhide the payload.\n\nFigure 3. Obfuscation to hide payload\n\nOnce it goes through the deobfuscation process, we can see that it is using injection to\ndeliver its malicious payload. In this case, it is loading the stage 1 downloader.\n\nFigure 4. Thread created after call to VirtualProtectEx that contains the injection instruction to\ndownload and execute Trickbot\n\nOnce a memory region is created by the call to VirtualProtectEx, a thread is created and\nexecuted. This new thread contains the actual payload to execute assembly instructions in\nmemory. It then unpacks itself and proceeds to contact C2 servers in order to download and\nexecute Trickbot.\n\nThe campaign utilizes that same strategy as previous Trickbot attacks. The individuals\nbehind Trickbot have used trending topics before to lure victims and extend their installed\nbase. The campaign just prior to the current one leveraging the Black Lives Matter\n[movement in the United States, was focused on COVID-19, which we previously analyzed.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/attackers-taking-advantage-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-media-frenzy)\nPerforming OSINT research, it appears that the command and control servers used by the\nactors behind this latest campaign have also compromised two specific sites, a city\ngovernment website based in South East Asia using the Joomla CMS, and a manufacturer in\nthe United States that is using WordPress as its CMS.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the time of discovery, FortiGuard Labs was one of a handful of vendors who had detected\nthe sample used in this analysis:\n\nFile name: e-vote_form_78211.doc\n\n[SHA256 35E1F022861474407246F0C66218A83019381E8745E4C6B294CF150F401C16DC\n\nDetected as: VBA/Agent.KJMLBSB!tr\n\nFigure 5. Limited Coverage During Time of Discovery\n\n## Global Spread\n\nAnalyzing the domains and infrastructure used by the threat actors, we find that they are all\nhosted in the Czech Republic (CD-Telematika a.s.). While this does not mean anything in\nterms of attribution, it is still interesting that this is the ISP chosen by the actors behind this\nlatest Trickbot campaign. Scouring our passive DNS records has revealed nothing in terms\nof past campaigns originating from the identified servers, which is increasingly the case\ngiven the reality of easy-to-spin-up virtual private servers and on-demand cloud\ninfrastructures.\n\nWe can also see that a spike developed quite noticeably on the day this was discovered\n(June 10 ). This is true for all domains related to this specific campaign:th\n\nFigure 6. Brand new spike for all domains used in this campaign observed on June 10\n\nWhile the US and Canada are its primary targets, we have detected variations of this\ncampaign affecting other countries as well. Here is a brief breakdown of what we have\ndiscovered.\n\nName: mnjcszrh.monster\n\nAddress: 82.202.65.177\n\nFigure 7: Domain Name - mnjcszrh.monster\n\nBased on our telemetry, the top 5 countries targeted by this specific campaign are Canada\n(48%) and the United States (46%), with France, Cyprus, and Italy having seen activity\naveraging less than one percent.\n\nName: shmbidgp.monster\n\nAddress: 82.202.65.178\n\nFigure 8: Domain Name - shmbidgp.monster\n\n\n-----\n\nThe top 5 countries targeted by this specific campaign are Canada (48%) and the United\nStates (46%). This time, France, Thailand, and Cyprus have seen less than 1% of activity.\n\nName: ygzggxeh.monster\n\nAddress: 82.202.65.125\n\nFigure 9: Domain Name - ygzggxeh.monster\n\nWe can now see a pattern developing. The top countries targeted by this specific campaign\nare again, the United States (46%) and Canada (45%), this time with Italy, Cyprus, and\nOman averaging less than one percent of activity. While the US and Canada are clearly the\nprimary targets, Cyprus is consistently included in the spillover.\n\nName: vmrriktf.monster\n\nAddress: 89.203.251.79\n\nFigure 10: Domain Name - vmrriktf.monster\n\nInterestingly, based on our telemetry, there were only 4 countries targeted by this specific\ncampaign. And other than the usual targets of the United States (49%) and Canada (48%),\nthe other countries impacted this time are Rwanda and United Kingdom, averaging less than\none percent of activity.\n\nName: copsbiau.monster\n\nAddress: 89.203.248.175\n\nFigure 11: Domain Name - copsbiau.monster\n\nFinally, our telemetry shows that the top 5 countries targeted by this specific campaign again\ninclude the United States (61%) and Canada (36%), and with Italy and Cyprus again\nshowing up, but this time with Germany included. These three countries have also seen\nactivity averaging less than one percent.\n\n## Mitigation of the Malicious Spam Campaign\n\n[FortiGuard Labs recommends that all AV and](https://fortiguard.com/learnmore#av) [IPS definitions are kept up to date on a](https://www.fortinet.com/products/ips.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-ips-landing-page)\ncontinual basis, and that organizations maintain a proactive patching routine when vendor\nupdates are available. If it is deemed that patching is not feasible, it is recommended that\nIPS be used for proximity control, also known as virtual patching, and that a risk assessment\nis conducted to determine additional mitigation safeguards within an environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the meantime, organizations are strongly encouraged to conduct ongoing training\nsessions to educate and inform personnel about the latest phishing/spearphishing attacks.\nThey also need to encourage their employees to never open attachments from someone\nthey don’t know, and to always treat emails from unrecognized/untrusted senders with\ncaution.\n\n**Initial Access Mitigation:** [FortiMail or other secure mail gateway solutions can be used to](https://www.fortinet.com/products/email-security/fortimail.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-fortimail-main-page)\nblock specific file types such as the ones outlined in this blog. FortiMail can also be\n[configured to send attachments to our FortiSandbox solution (ATP), either on-premises or in](https://www.fortinet.com/products/sandbox/fortisandbox.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-fortisandbox-main-page)\nthe cloud, to determine if a file displays malicious behavior. [FortiGate firewalls with anti-virus](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-fortigate-main-page)\nenabled, combined with a valid subscription, are able detect and block this threat if properly\nconfigured.\n\n**Execution: Since it has been reported that this threat has been delivered via social**\nengineering distribution mechanisms, it is crucial that end users within an organization are\nmade aware of the various types of attacks being delivered using this method. This can be\naccomplished through regular training sessions and impromptu tests using predetermined\ntemplates by internal security departments within an organization. Simple user awareness\ntraining on how to spot emails with malicious attachments or links could stop initial access\ninto the network.\n\n**Fortinet Solutions: If user awareness training fails and a user opens a malicious**\n[attachment or link, FortiEDR is able to prevent TrickBot from executing. FortiClientrunning](https://www.fortinet.com/products/endpoint-security/fortiedr.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2020-q1-fortiedr)\nthe latest up-to-date virus signatures will also detect and block this file and associated\nfiles.The file(s) highlighted in our report are currently being detected with the current\ndefinition:\n\n**[78.072 (Added Jun 10, 2020)](https://fortiguard.com/updates/antivirus?version=78.072)**\n\n**Exfiltration and C&C: A FortiGate located at each of your ingress and egress points with its**\nWeb Filtering service enabled, and with up-to-date definitions and/or Botnet Security enabled\nwill detect and block any observable outbound connections if configured correctly.\n\n**Web Filtering: All network IOCs in this report have been placed on the block list by the**\nFortiGuard Web Filtering service.\n\n**Malicious Word Document Protection: FortiGuard CDR (Content Disarm &**\n[Reconstruction) supported by FortiMail and FortiGate, processes all incoming files,](https://www.fortinet.com/products/email-security/fortimail.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-fortimail-main-page)\ndeconstructs them, and then strips all active content from those files in real-time to create a\nflat, sanitized file. CDR fortifies zero-day file protection strategies by proactively removing\nany possibility of malicious content in your files.\n\n**Other Fortinet Safeguards: It is important to note that as attacks continue to become more**\nsophisticated they can sometimes circumvent your security defenses. This is why it is\nimportant to ensure that in addition to a layered security strategy you also have the ability to\n\n\n-----\n\ndetect anomalous activity that could be malicious.\n\nIn addition, our Enterprise Bundle addresses this and similar attacks.
