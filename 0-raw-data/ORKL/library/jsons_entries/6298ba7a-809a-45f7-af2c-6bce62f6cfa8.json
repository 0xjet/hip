SVR cyber actors are known_\n_and tracked in open source as APT29,_\n_Cozy Bear, and the Dukes._\n\n**UK and US governments recently**\n**[attributed](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-us-call-out-russia-for-solarwinds-compromise)** **SVR’s responsibility for a**\n**series of cyber-attacks, including the**\ncompromise of SolarWinds and the\ntargeting of COVID-19 vaccine\ndevelopers.\n\nAlongside this attribution, the United\nStates’ National Security Agency\n(NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI), and Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\n[released an advisory](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/15/2002621240/-1/-1/0/CSA_SVR_TARGETS_US_ALLIES_UOO13234021.PDF) detailing the\nexploits most recently used by the\ngroup. The FBI, Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS) and CISA\n[also issued a joint report providing](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-116a)\ninformation on the SVR’s cyber tools,\ntargets, techniques, and capabilities.\n\nThe SVR is Russia’s civilian foreign\nintelligence service. The group uses a\n**variety of tools and techniques to**\n**predominantly target overseas**\n**governmental, diplomatic, think-tank,**\n**healthcare and energy targets globally**\n\n\nfor intelligence gain. The SVR is a\ntechnologically sophisticated and\nhighly capable cyber actor. It has\ndeveloped capabilities to target\norganisations globally, including in the\nUK, US, Europe, NATO member\nstates and Russia’s neighbours.\n\nThe NCSC, NSA, CISA and CSE\n[previously issued a joint report](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development)\nregarding the group’s targeting of\norganisations involved in COVID-19\nvaccine development throughout 2020\nusing [WellMess](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/07/malware-wellmes-9b78.html) and WellMail\nmalware.\n\nSVR cyber operators appear to have\nreacted to this report by changing their\nTTPs in an attempt to avoid further\ndetection and remediation efforts by\nnetwork defenders.\n\nThese changes included the\n[deployment of the open-source tool](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver)\n[Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) in an attempt to maintain their\naccesses.\n\nThe group has also been observed\nmaking use of numerous\nvulnerabilities, most recently the\n[widely reported Microsoft Exchange](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advice-following-microsoft-vulnerabilities-exploitation)\n[vulnerabilities.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advice-following-microsoft-vulnerabilities-exploitation)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Initial access\n\n###### Further CVEs in use by SVR\n\nAs previously reported, the group frequently uses publicly available exploits to\n[conduct widespread scanning (T1595.002) and exploitation (T1190) against](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/002/)\nvulnerable systems. The group seeks to take full advantage of a variety of exploits\nwhen publicised. The group has used:\n\n  - [CVE-2018-13379 FortiGate](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/critical-risk-unpatched-fortinet-vpn-devices)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-1653 Cisco router](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-2725 Oracle WebLogic Server](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2725.html)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-9670 Zimbra](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9670)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/alert-vpn-vulnerabilities)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-19781 Citrix](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/citrix-alert)\n\n  - [CVE-2019-7609 Kibana](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-6-6-1-an-5-6-15-security-update/169077)\n\n  - [CVE-2020-4006 VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html)\n\n  - [CVE-2020-5902 F5 Big-IP](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K52145254)\n\n  - [CVE-2020-14882 Oracle WebLogic](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14882)\n\n  - [CVE-2021-21972 VMWare vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html)\n\nThis list should not be treated as exhaustive. The group will look to rapidly exploit\nrecently released public vulnerabilities which are likely to enable initial access to their\ntargets. More information about these exploits can be found in previous NCSC\n[advisories on Citrix](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/citrix-alert) [and VPN vulnerabilities.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/alert-vpn-vulnerabilities)\n\n###### Network defenders should ensure that security patches are applied promptly following CVE announcements for products they manage.\n\nMost recently, the group has also scanned for Microsoft Exchange servers\n[vulnerable to CVE-2021-26855. Such activity is typically followed by the use of](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers)\n[further exploits and deployment of a webshell (T1505.003) if successful. Other](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003/)\nMicrosoft Exchange exploits commonly used in conjunction with this CVE include:\n\n  - CVE-2021-26857 (SOAP payload)\n\n  - CVE-2021-26858 (Arbitrary files)\n\n  - CVE-2021-27065 (Arbitrary files)\n\nMore information about these exploits and mitigation advice can be found on the\n[NCSC website.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advice-following-microsoft-vulnerabilities-exploitation)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Supply chain compromises\n\nThe SolarWinds campaign demonstrates the actor’s willingness to target\n[organisations that supply privileged software (T1195.002), such as network](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002/)\nmanagement or security applications, to many users or organisations.\n\nThese types of attacks give SVR actors initial access to a large number of\norganisations. From this initial access, the actors select a much smaller number of\nvictims for follow-on compromise activity. These victims are targeted in line with\nintelligence priorities.\n\nEnterprise products and applications deployed across multiple organisations will be\nattractive supply chain targets. Products which require access to a significant portion\nof user or network data to operate are likely to be especially attractive targets. Earlier\n[this year Mimecast](https://www.mimecast.com/incident-report/) [and SolarWinds](https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/securityadvisory) acknowledged compromises, now known to be\nconducted by SVR cyber operators.\n\n#### Post-compromise\n\n###### Additional malware in use by SVR \n\nNCSC and partner industry analysis shows that on multiple occasions, SVR actors\nused Cobalt Strike, a commercial Red Team command and control framework, to\ncarry out their operations after initial exploitation (e.g. compromise of SolarWinds\nplatform).\n\nThe group also deployed GoldFinder, GoldMax and Sibot malware after\ncompromising a victim via SolarWinds. GoldMax is a custom backdoor, GoldFinder\nis a custom tool – both are written in Golang. Sibot is a simple custom downloader\n[and, unlike other malware in recent use by the group, is written in VBS (T1059.005).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005/)\n[Microsoft’s analysis of this malware can be found here.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\n\nIn separate incidents, the NCSC observed that once SVR actors had gained initial\naccess to a victim’s network, they then made use of the open-source Red Team\ncommand and control framework named Sliver.\n\n###### The use of the Sliver framework was likely an attempt to ensure access to a number of the existing WellMess and WellMail victims was maintained.\n\n[Following the publication of the joint WellMess Advisory SVR cyber operators used](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development)\n[the Sliver framework. Sliver is an “…open source, cross-platform adversary](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver)\n\n\n-----\n\nsimulation/red team platform…” written in Golang that supports command and\n[control mechanisms over a variety of protocols including Mutual-TLS (T1573.002),](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002/)\n[HTTP/S (T1071.001) and DNS (T1071.004).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/)\n\nThe use of the Sliver framework was likely an attempt to ensure access to a number\nof the existing WellMess and WellMail victims was maintained following the exposure\nof those capabilities. As observed with the SolarWinds incidents, SVR operators\noften used separate command and control infrastructure for each victim of Sliver.\n\nSVR actors have used methods other than malware to maintain persistence on high\nvalue targets, including the use of stolen credentials.\n\n###### Mail server persistence \n\nSVR actors often target administrator mailboxes in order to acquire further network\ninformation and access. This is likely in an effort to better understand the target\nnetwork and obtain further privileges or credentials for persistence and/or lateral\nmovement.\n\nIn one example identified by the NCSC, the actor had searched for authentication\n[credentials in mailboxes, including passwords and PKI keys (T1552).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/)\n\nIn another incident, the actor leveraged access gained from the SolarWinds\n[campaign to compromise a certificate (T1552.004) issued by Mimecast. The actor](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004)\nused that access to authenticate a subset of Mimecast’s products with customer\n[systems (T1199). In this way, the actor was able to abuse the Mimecast Azure app](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)\nin order to compromise the final target.\n\nThe Mimecast Azure application's default application permissions allowed the\napplication full access to all mailboxes in the victim organisation's tenant. Once the\nactor had gained access to this application, they were able to utilise the applications\npermissions in order to extract emails from any mailbox used by the victim\n[organisation (T1114.002). For reference, the default permissions that were granted](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/002)\nto the Mimecast application can be seen below, along with a definition of the\npermission:\n\n  - “full_access_as_app” under Exchange. This is a highly privileged permission\n\nand allows the app to use Exchange Web services with full access to all\nmailboxes.\n\n  - “User.Read” under Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is an API that allows\n\ncustom applications to access Microsoft O365 data and services. This\npermission grants the app the ability to read the profile of the signed-in user.\n\nAs a result, no further privilege escalation or lateral movement was needed by the\nactor to access emails of interest.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Mandiant FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/01/remediation-and-hardening-strategies-for-microsoft-365-to-defend-against-unc2452.html) has detailed a number of detection and mitigation strategies that\nwill help organisations proactively harden Microsoft O365 environments against\nthese techniques. This includes recommendations on how to detect suspicious\nmodifications in a user’s O365 mailbox permissions.\n\n#### MITRE ATT&CK[® ]\n\n[This advisory has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework, a\nglobally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on\nreal-world observations.\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Procedure**\n\n|Tactic|Technique|Procedure|\n|---|---|---|\n|Reconnaissance|T1595.002: Active Scanning|SVR frequently scans for publicly available exploits, most recently including Microsoft Exchange servers vulnerable to CVE-2021- 26855.|\n|Initial Access|T1190: Exploit Public- Facing Application|SVR frequently uses publicly available exploits to conduct widespread exploitation of vulnerable systems, including against Citrix, Pulse Secure, FortiGate, Zimbra and VMWare.|\n||T1195.002: Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain|SVR targets organisations who supply privileged software to intelligence targets.|\n||T1199: Trusted Relationship|SVR leveraged access gained from the SolarWinds campaign to compromise a certificate issued by Mimecast, which it then used to authenticate a subset of Mimecast's products with customer systems.|\n|Execution|T1059.005: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic|SVR deployed Sibot, a simple custom downloader written in VBS, after compromising victims via SolarWinds.|\n|Persistence|T1505.003: Server Software Component: Web Shell|SVR typically deploy a web shell on Microsoft Exchange servers following successful compromise.|\n||T1078: Valid Accounts|SVR actors have maintained persistence on high value targets using stolen credentials.|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion \n\nThe SVR targets organisations that align with Russian foreign intelligence interests,\nincluding governmental, think-tank, policy and energy targets, as well as more timebound targeting, for example COVID-19 vaccine targeting in 2020.\n\nOrganisations are advised to follow the mitigation advice and guidance below, as well\nas the detection rules in the appendix to help protect against this activity.\n\nOrganisations should also follow the advice and guidance in the recently published\njoint NSA/CISA/FBI [advisory and the subsequent joint FBI/DHS/CISA](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/15/2002621240/-1/-1/0/CSA_SVR_TARGETS_US_ALLIES_UOO13234021.PDF) [report,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-116a) which\ndetail further TTPs linked to SVR cyber actors.\n\n###### Reporting to the NCSC \n\nUK organisations affected by the activity outlined in should report any suspected\n[compromises to the NCSC via the website.](https://report.ncsc.gov.uk/)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Mitigation advice\n\n  - SVR actors regularly make use of publicly known vulnerabilities (alongside\n\ncomplex supply chain attacks) to gain initial access onto target networks.\nManaging and applying security updates as quickly as possible will help\nreduce the attack surface available for SVR actors, and force them to use\nhigher equity tooling to gain a foothold in the networks.\n\n  - Despite the complexity of supply chain attacks, following basic cyber security\n\nprinciples will make it harder for even sophisticated actors to compromise\ntarget networks. By implementing good network security controls and\neffectively managing user privileges organisations will help prevent lateral\nmovement between hosts. This will help limit the effectiveness of even\ncomplex attacks. Further NCSC advice is available via the links in the\nguidance section below.\n\n  - Detecting supply chain attacks, such as the Mimecast compromise, will\n\nalways be difficult. An organisation may be able to detect this sort of activity\nthrough heuristic detection methodologies such as the volume of emails being\naccessed or by identifying anomalous IP traffic. However, the actor frequently\nuses malicious infrastructure located within the target organisation’s own\ncountry, likely in an effort to frustrate detection efforts.\n\n  - Organisations should ensure sufficient logging (both cloud and on premises)\n\nis enabled and stored for a suitable amount of time, to identify compromised\naccounts, exfiltrated material and actor infrastructure. Mail retention and\ncontent policies should also be implemented to reduce the amount of\nsensitive information available upon successful compromise. Particularly\nsensitive information, including information relating to network architecture\nand network security, should be safeguarded appropriately.\n\n  - As part of Microsoft's 'Advanced Auditing' functionality, Microsoft have\n\nintroduced a new mailbox auditing action called 'MailItemsAccessed' which\nhelps with investigating the compromise of email accounts. This is part of\nExchange mailbox auditing and is enabled by default for users that are\nassigned an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 E5 license or for organisations with a\nMicrosoft 365 E5 compliance add-on subscription.\n\n  - With ‘MailItemsAccessed’ enabled, administrators are able to identify almost\n\nevery single email accessed by a user, giving organisations forensic\ndefensibility to help assert which individual pieces of mail were or were not\nmaliciously accessed by an attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Further guidance \n\nA variety of mitigations will be of use in defending against the campaigns detailed in this\nreport:\n\n  - **Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date: use the latest**\nsupported versions, apply security patches promptly, use anti-virus and scan\nregularly to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC\nguidance: [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware)\n\n  - **Use multi-factor authentication (/2-factor authentication/two-step**\n**authentication) to reduce the impact of password compromises. See NCSC**\nguidance: [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services)\n[services](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services) [and https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa)\n2fa\n\n  - **Treat people as your first line of defence. Tell staff how to report suspected**\nphishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Investigate their reports\npromptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening\nattachments. See NCSC guidance: [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing)\n\n  - **Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be**\nneeded to analyse network intrusions. See NCSC\nGuidance: [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes)\n[purposes.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes)\n\n  - **Prevent and detect lateral movement in your organisation’s networks. See**\nNCSC guidance: [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix\n\n###### Snort rules\n```\nSliver HTTP request URLs are procedurally generated according to a\nset pattern, as per the implant/sliver/transports/tcp-http.go file.\n\n```\n  - `The resource file extension defines the beacon type.`\n\n  - `A random number generator decides whether to include a parent`\n```\n   folder in the URL path.\n\n```\n  - `The parent folder and resource filename are randomly chosen`\n```\n   from predefined lists per beacon type.\n\n```\n  - `The URL query parameter underscore _ is a numeric value which`\n```\n   specifies the payload encoding format.\n\n```\n  - `Results can be further filtered by User-Agent, Accept-Language`\n```\n   and PHPSESSID Cookie headers.\n alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon  robots.txt getPublicKey\"; content:\"/robots.txt?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\AGET\n (?:\\/(?:static|www|assets|text|docs|sample))?\\/robots\\.txt\\?_=[0-9]{1,9}\n HTTP/\";)\n alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon  sample.txt getPublicKey\"; content:\"/sample.txt?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\AGET\n (?:\\/(?:static|www|assets|text|docs|sample))?\\/sample\\.txt\\?_=[0-9]{1,9}\n HTTP/\";)\n alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon - info.txt\n getPublicKey\"; content:\"/info.txt?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\AGET\n (?:\\/(?:static|www|assets|text|docs|sample))?\\/info\\.txt\\?_=[0-9]{1,9}\n HTTP/\";)\n alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon  example.txt getPublicKey\"; content:\"/example.txt?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\AGET\n (?:\\/(?:static|www|assets|text|docs|sample))?\\/example\\.txt\\?_=[0-9]{1,9}\n HTTP/\";)\n alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon - .jsp\n getSessionID\"; content:\".jsp?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\APOST\n (?:\\/(?:app|admin|upload|actions|api))?\\/(?:login|admin|session|action)\\.\n jsp\\?_=[0-9]{1,9} HTTP/\";)\n alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon  login.php Send\"; content:\"/login.php?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\APOST\n (?:\\/(?:api|rest|drupal|wordpress))?\\/login\\.php\\?_=[0-9]{1,9} HTTP/\";)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon signin.php Send\"; content:\"/signin.php?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\APOST\n(?:\\/(?:api|rest|drupal|wordpress))?\\/signin\\.php\\?_=[0-9]{1,9} HTTP/\";)\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon - api.php\nSend\"; content:\"/api.php?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\APOST\n(?:\\/(?:api|rest|drupal|wordpress))?\\/api\\.php\\?_=[0-9]{1,9} HTTP/\";)\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon samples.php Send\"; content:\"/samples.php?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\APOST\n(?:\\/(?:api|rest|drupal|wordpress))?\\/samples\\.php\\?_=[0-9]{1,9} HTTP/\";)\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon underscore.min.js Poll\"; content:\"/underscore.min.js?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\AGET\n(?:\\/(?:js|static|assets|dist|javascript))?\\/underscore\\.min\\.js\\?_=[09]{1,9} HTTP/\";)\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg: \"Sliver HTTP implant beacon jquery.min.js Poll\"; content:\"/jquery.min.js?_=\"; pcre:\"/\\AGET\n(?:\\/(?:js|static|assets|dist|javascript))?\\/jquery\\.min\\.js\\?_=[09]{1,9} HTTP/\";)\n\n```\n\n###### YARA Rules\n```\nThe following Yara rules will aid network defenders in\ndetecting Sliver.
