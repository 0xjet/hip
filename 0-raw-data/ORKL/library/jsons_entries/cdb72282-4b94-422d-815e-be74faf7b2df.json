SysJoker uses different temporary text files to log the results of the\n[commands,” explains Intezer’s report.](http://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/new-backdoor-sysjoker)\n\n\"These text files are deleted immediately, stored in a JSON object and then encoded and\nwritten to a file named \"microsoft_Windows.dll”.”\n\nAfter gathering system and network data, the malware will create persistence by adding a\nnew registry key\n(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run). Random\nsleep times are interposed between all functions leading to this point.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next step for the malware is to reach out to the actor-controlled C2 server, and for this,\nit uses a hardcoded Google Drive link.\n\n**Resolving the hardcoded Google Drive link**\n\n_Source: Intezer_\nThe link hosts a \"domain.txt” file that the actors regularly update to provide available servers\nto live beacons. This list constantly changes to avoid detection and blocking.\n\nThe system information collected in the first stages of the infection is sent as the first\nhandshake to the C2. The C2 replies with a unique token that serves as the identifier of the\ninfected endpoint.\n\nFrom there, the C2 may instruct the backdoor to install additional malware, run commands\non the infected device, or command the backdoor to remove itself from the device. Those\nlast two instructions haven't been implemented yet, though.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SysJoker C2 communications diagram**\n\n_Source: Intezer_\nWhile the Linux and macOS variants do not have a first-stage dropper in the form of a DLL,\nthey ultimately perform the same malicious behavior on the infected device.\n\n## Detection and prevention\n\nIntezer has provided full indicators of compromise (IOCs) in their report that admins can use\nto detect the presence of SysJoker on an infected device.\n\nBelow, we have outlined some of the IOCs for each operating system.\n\n**On Windows, the malware files are located under the \"C:\\ProgramData\\RecoverySystem\"**\nfolder, at C:\\ProgramData\\SystemData\\igfxCUIService.exe,\nand C:\\ProgramData\\SystemData\\microsoft_Windows.dll. For persistence, the malware\ncreates an Autorun \"Run\" value of \"igfxCUIService\" that launches the igfxCUIService.exe\nmalware executable.\n\n**On Linux, the files and directories are created under \"/.Library/” while persistence is**\nestablished by creating the following cron job: @reboot\n(/.Library/SystemServices/updateSystem).\n\n**On macOS, the files are created on \"/Library/” and persistence is achieved via**\nLaunchAgent under the path: /Library/LaunchAgents/com apple update plist\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 domains shared in the Intezer report are the following:\n\nhttps[://]bookitlab[.]tech\nhttps[://]winaudio-tools[.]com\nhttps[://]graphic-updater[.]com\nhttps[://]github[.]url-mini[.]com\nhttps[://]office360-update[.]com\nhttps[://]drive[.]google[.]com/uc?export=download&id=1NVty4YX0dPHdxkgMrbdCldQCpCaE-Hn\nhttps[://]drive[.]google[.]com/uc?\nexport=download&id=1W64PQQxrwY3XjBnv_QaeBQu-ePr537eu\n\nIf you found that you have been compromised by SysJoker, follow these three steps:\n\n1. Kill all processes related to the malware and manually delete the files and the relevant\n\npersistence mechanism.\n2. Run a memory scanner to ensure that all malicious files have been uprooted from the\n\ninfected system.\n3. Investigate the potential entry points, check firewall configurations, and update all\n\nsoftware tools to the latest available version.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Malicious PyPI package opens backdoors on Windows, Linux, and Macs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-pypi-package-opens-backdoors-on-windows-linux-and-macs/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[New Windows Subsystem for Linux malware steals browser auth cookies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-windows-subsystem-for-linux-malware-steals-browser-auth-cookies/)\n\n[BPFDoor malware uses Solaris vulnerability to get root privileges](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-malware-uses-solaris-vulnerability-to-get-root-privileges/)\n\n[Backdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Linux](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/linux/)\n[macOS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/macos/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[SysJoker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sysjoker/)\n[Windows](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/windows/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
