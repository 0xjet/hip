If a malicious document is opened, a remote access trojan that we're calling \"NavRAT\" is\n\ndownloaded, which can perform various actions on the victim machine, including command\n\nexecution, and has keylogging capabilities.\n\nThe decoy document is named \"미북 정상회담 전망 및 대비.hwp\" (Prospects for US-North Korea\n\nSummit.hwp). The HWP file format is mainly used in South Korea. An Encapsulated PostScript\n\n(EPS) object is embedded within the document in order to execute malicious shellcode on the victim\n\nsystems. The purpose is to download and execute an additional payload hosted on a compromised\n\nwebsite: NavRAT.\n\nThis is a classic RAT that can download, upload, execute commands on the victim host and, finally,\n\nperform keylogging. However, the command and control (C2) infrastructure is very specific. It uses\n\n\nSearch Blog\n\n\n**S UB S C R IB E TO OUR FE E D**\n\nPosts\n\nComments\n\n[Subscribe via Email](https://www.talosintelligence.com/blog_subscription)\n\n**B LOG A R C HIV E**\n\n[▼ 2 01 8](javascript:void(0)) (79)\n\n[► J U N E](javascript:void(0)) (1)\n\n[▼ M AY](javascript:void(0)) (15)\n\nNavRAT Uses US-North Korea\n\nSummit As Decoy For Att...\n\n[Vulnerability Spotlight: Natus](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/vulnerability-spotlight-natus-part2.html)\n\nNeuroWorks Multiple...\n\n[Beers with Talos EP 30 - VPNFilter,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/beers-with-talos-ep-30-vpnfilter.html)\n\nthe Unfiltered...\n\n[Threat Roundup for May 18-25](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/threat-roundup-0518-0525.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the most interesting questions we still have is regarding attribution — and who is behind this\n\n[malware. Previously, we published several articles concerning Group123 (here, here, here, here and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/01/korea-in-crosshairs.html&sa=D&ust=1527796940962000)\n\n[here).

The summit is the latest in a line of signs of\n\ndiplomatic outreach from North Korea, following the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity\n\nand Unification of the Korean Peninsula between South Korea and North Korea on April 27, 2018.\n\nThis document contains the aforementioned EPS object. This object is used to execute malicious\n\nshellcode on the system. This is a seemingly common vector for attackers when using HWP\n\ndocuments, which we have previously encountered and described.\n\n## Malicious Code\n\nAs we already mentioned in our previous articles concerning malicious documents, EPS is effective\n\nfrom an attacker's point of view. It is a powerful, stack-based scripting language, and in malicious\n\nuse cases, can be abused to obtain additional payloads. Here is the content of the file:\n\n\n/shellcode <90909090909090909090E800<...redacted…\n\n>4D2D6DC95CBD5DC1811111111111111> def\n\n<7B0D0A2756...redacted…>312067657420636C6F736566696C650D0A717569740D0A7D>\n\n\n-----\n\nThe executed shellcode will first perform a decoding routine designed to download an additional\n\npayload from the internet. In our case, the file URI was:\n\n\nhxxp://artndesign2[.]cafe24[.]com:80/skin_board/s_build_cafeblog/exp_include\n\n/img.png\n\n\nThis website is a legitimate Korean website. We assume that this website was compromised in\n\norder to deliver the final payload on the targeted systems. This is a method we have previously\n\nobserved with attacks focusing on the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe image is downloaded directly, and the shellcode is loaded and executed in memory. This is an\n\nexample of fileless execution by only running malicious processes within the memory of the victim\n\nhost. The purpose is to drop and execute a decoded executable using the following path:\n\n\n%APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp\\~emp.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /C systeminfo >> \"C:\\Ahnlab\\$$$A24F.TMP\"\n\n\n\"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /C tasklist /v >> \"C:\\Ahnlab\\$$$A24F.TMP\"\n\n\n## NAVRAT\n\n Capabilities\n\nNavRAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) designed to upload, download and execute files. The\n\nanalysed sample contains many verbose logs. The malware's author logs every action to a file\n\n(encoded). It's not often we are able to use the attacker's own logging capability to facilitate\n\nanalysis, which can make our research easier.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis screenshot shows the logs messages during the process injection with the API usage.\n\nNavRAT starts by copying itself (~emp.exe) to the %ProgramData%\\Ahnlab\\GoogleUpdate.exe\n\n[path. It uses the path of a well-known security company located in South Korea named AhnLab.](http://www.ahnlab.com/&sa=D&ust=1527796940968000)\n\nNavRAT then creates a registry key in order to execute this file copy at the next reboot of the\n\nsystem, an initial method of persistence. The log files mentioned previously are stored in the same\n\ndirectory as NavRAT on the victim machine, again making it easy for us to find and analyse the\n\nadditional log files.\n\nNavRAT has support for process injection. By using this method, it will copy itself into a running\n\nInternet Explorer process in order to avoid detection by running as an independent process. The\n\nmalware is able to register the keystrokes on the targeted user's system:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most interesting part of this RAT is the C2 server architecture. The malware uses the Naver\n\nemail platform in order to communicate with the operators.\n\n## Command & Control\n\nThe malware communicates with the Naver email platform in order to communicate with the\n\noperator. The credentials are hardcoded in the sample:\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, during our investigation, NavRAT was unable to communicate with the email address:\n\n\n\n[05/30/2018, 17:39:45] NaverUpload Start!!\n\n[05/30/2018, 17:39:46] NaverUpload :PreUploading success\n\n[05/30/2018, 17:39:46]  uploading step-1 : HttpSendRequest failed.\n\nErr[12150]\n\n[05/30/2018, 17:39:46] ////////////// Response Headers getting failure\n\n//////////\n\n[05/30/2018, 17:39:46] NaverUpload :Uploading failed.

Try[4]\n\n[05/30/2018, 17:39:52] UploadProc : UploadFile Err\n\n\n-----\n\nThe broken communication was due to protection implemented by Naver. The malware was\n\npresumably executed from too many different countries, and the account is currently locked:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nNavRAT is able to download and execute files located in the attachment of a received email. It is\n\nable to remove emails, and finally, it is able to send an email via the Naver account. In our sample,\n\nthe data is attempted to be sent to: chioekang59@daum[.]net.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Archeology\n\nDuring our investigation, we tried to find additional samples of NavRAT. We only identified one old\n\nsample compiled in May 2016. As in our case, this old sample used a fake AhnLab directory to store\n\nlogs files (C:\\AhnLab\\). In this version, the compilation path was not removed:\n\n\nN:\\CodeProject\\VC_Code Project\\Attack_Spy\\mailacounts.com\\src_total_20160430\n\n- v10.0(DIV)\\bin\\PrecomExe(Win32).pdb\n\n\nWe can conclude that NavRAT has probably existed since 2016 — which we believe to be version 10\n\nat the time. The attacker(s) appear to have remained under the radar for several years. We assume\n\nthis malware has been sparingly used and only for very specific targets.\n\n## GROUP123 LINKS?\n\nAs we explore the Korean malware landscape, we always have burning questions relating to any\n\npossible links with Group123. We identified some relevant points which we believe with medium\n\nconfidence suggests the involvement of Group123 based on previous TTPs used by this group.\n\nThe modus operandi is identical to previous Group123 campaigns — a HWP document with\n\nembedded EPS object containing malicious shellcode. The shellcode of the embedded object is\n\ndesigned to download an image, which is, in fact, a new shellcode used to decode an embedded\n\nexecutable. We saw this exact same methodology used by Group123 during previous attacks. One\n\n[such example is ROKRAT, another remote access trojan we discovered in April 2017 that targeted](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/04/introducing-rokrat.html&sa=D&ust=1527796940972000)\n\nthe Korean peninsula.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe performed the same analysis for the shellcode located in the downloaded image file and the\n\nshellcode is not exactly the same, but the design is very similar.\n\nAdditionally, we can add the victimology and usage of a public cloud platform as C2 server. The\n\nattacker simply moved from Yandex, Pcloud, Mediafire, Twitter, and now they are using Naver. This\n\nplatform is mainly used locally in South Korea. A connection to this platform cannot be identified as\n\na malicious activity. The malicious traffic will be hidden in the global flow.\n\nll h l h d f d h d h\n\n\n-----\n\nNavRAT we do not see this intentional and less vague level of IOC/False Flag scenarios in an\n\nattempt to infer attribution to another entity. NavRAT lacks these non-obvious false flags and thus\n\nwe do not believe this to be related to non Group123 actors.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nSouth Korea is still, and always will remain, an attractive target for advanced actors. The region has\n\ngeopolitical interests that arise from the segregations that exist between the secretive North Korea\n\nand the more open South Korea. In this campaign, the attackers used a classical HWP document in\n\norder to download and execute a previously unknown malware: NavRAT. The author used real\n\nevents in order to forge the decoy document. It chose the U.S. - North Korea Summit to entice the\n\ntargets to open it.\n\nThe approach is close to the techniques used by Group123 attacks we have observed and written\n\nabout over the past 18 months or so: the shellcode contains similarities, the final payload is\n\nmalicious shellcode located in an image hosted on a compromised website, and the author uses an\n\nopen platform as the C2 server. In this case, NavRAT used an email provider: Naver, while ROKRAT\n\npreviously used cloud providers. And finally, the victimology and the targeted region are the same.\n\nAll these elements are not strict proof of a link between NavRAT and ROKRAT. However, we asses\n\nwith medium confidence that NavRAT is linked to Group123.\n\nUsing well-known local cloud/email providers is smart from an attacker's point of view. It's really\n\nhard to identify the malicious traffic in the middle of the legitimate traffic. In this case, the email\n\nprovider locked the account due to attempts from too many different countries to access the email\n\ninbox. We identified the sample on several public sandbox systems, and we assume the multiple\n\nconnection attempts were performed by these sandboxes.\n\n## COVERAGE\n\n\n-----\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection&sa=D&ust=1527796940975000)\n\nby these threat actors.\n\n[CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware used in](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html&sa=D&ust=1527796940975000)\n\nthese attacks.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html&sa=D&ust=1527796940976000)\n\n[Network Security appliances such as NGFW, NGIPS, and Meraki MX can detect malicious activity](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/index.html&sa=D&ust=1527796940976000)\n\nassociated with this threat.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html&sa=D&ust=1527796940977000)\n\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious domains,](https://umbrella.cisco.com/&sa=D&ust=1527796940977000)\n\nIPs and URLs hether sers are on or off the corporate net ork\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCS\n\nMalicious HWP: e5f191531bc1c674ea74f8885449f4d934d5f1aa7fd3aaa283fe70f9402b9574\n\nNavRAT: 4f06eaed3dd67ce31e7c8258741cf727964bd271c3590ded828ad7ba8d04ee57\n\nOnline Payload:\n\nhxxp://artndesign2[.]cafe24[.]com:80/skin_board/s_build_cafeblog/exp_include/img.png\n\n2016 NavRAT sample:\n\ne0257d187be69b9bee0a731437bf050d56d213b50a6fd29dd6664e7969f286ef\n\nP O S T E D BY [WARRE N M E RC E R AT](https://www.blogger.com/profile/01772306994239678057) 7 : 0 0 P M\n\nL ABE L S : [AP T, G RO U P 1 2 3, H ANG U L, H WP, K O RE A](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/search/label/APT) [, M ALWARE, NAVRAT, NO RT H K O RE A, S O U T H](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/search/label/Malware)\n\nK O RE A\n\nS H A RE T H I S\n\nP O S T\n\nNO COMMENTS:\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comment as:** [Google Account]\n\n\n\n[Google Account]\n\n\n**PreviewPreview**\n\n\nNE WE R\n\nP O S T\n\nS U BS C RI BE T O : [P O S T C O M M E NT S (AT O M )](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/feeds/6022799513636558525/comments/default)\n\n\n**PublishPublish**\n\n\n[H O M E](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/)\n\n\nO L D E R\n\nP O S T\n\n\n[Software](https://talosintelligence.com/software)\n\n[Reputation Center](https://talosintelligence.com/reputation)\n\n[Vulnerability Information](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability-reports)\n\n\n[Library](https://talosintelligence.com/resources)\n\n[Support Communities](https://talosintelligence.com/community)\n\n[Microsoft Advisory Snort Rules](https://talosintelligence.com/ms_advisories)\n\n\n[IP Blacklist Download](https://talosintelligence.com/documents/ip-blacklist)\n\n[AWBO Exercises](https://talosintelligence.com/awbo_exercises)\n\n[About Talos](https://talosintelligence.com/about)\n\n\n[Careers](https://talosintelligence.com/careers)\n\n[Blog](https://blog.talosintelligence.com)\n\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
