    "plain_text": "**August 11, 2017 | by Lindsay Smith, Ben Read | Threat Research**\n\n**FireEye has moderate confidence that a campaign targeting the hospitality sector is attributed to Russian**\n**[actor APT28. We believe this activity, which dates back to at least July 2017, was intended to target travelers](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/10/apt28-a-window-into-russias-cyber-espionage-operations.html)**\n\n**to hotels throughout Europe and the Middle East. The actor has used several notable techniques in these**\n\n**incidents such as sniffing passwords from Wi-Fi traffic, poisoning the NetBIOS Name Service, and spreading**\n\n**[laterally via the EternalBlue exploit.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/smb-exploited-wannacry-use-of-eternalblue.html)**\n\n**FireEye has uncovered a malicious document sent in spear phishing emails to multiple companies in the**\n\n**hospitality industry, including hotels in at least seven European countries and one Middle Eastern country in**\n\n**early July. Successful execution of the macro within the malicious document results in the installation of**\n\n**[APT28’s signature GAMEFISH malware.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/eps-processing-zero-days.html)**\n\n**The malicious document – Hotel_Reservation_Form.doc (MD5: 9b10685b774a783eabfecdb6119a8aa3), as**\n\n**seen in Figure 1 – contains a macro that base64 decodes a dropper that then deploys APT28’s signature**\n\n**GAMEFISH malware (MD5: 1421419d1be31f1f9ea60e8ed87277db), which uses mvband.net and**\n\n**mvtband.net as command and control (C2) domains.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Hotel_Reservation_Form.doc (MD5: 9b10685b774a783eabfecdb6119a8aa3)**\n\n**[APT28 is using novel techniques involving the EternalBlue exploit and the open source tool Responder to](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder)**\n**spread laterally through networks and likely target travelers. Once inside the network of a hospitality company,**\n\n**APT28 sought out machines that controlled both guest and internal Wi-Fi networks. No guest credentials**\n**were observed being stolen at the compromised hotels; however, in a separate incident that occurred in Fall**\n\n**2016, APT28 gained initial access to a victim’s network via credentials likely stolen from a hotel Wi-Fi**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Responder. Responder facilitates NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning. This technique listens for**\n**NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts from victim computers attempting to connect to network resources. Once**\n\n**received, Responder masquerades as the sought-out resource and causes the victim computer to send the**\n**username and hashed password to the attacker-controlled machine. APT28 used this technique to steal**\n\n**usernames and hashed passwords that allowed escalation of privileges in the victim network.**\n\n**To spread through the hospitality company’s network, APT28 used a version of the EternalBlue SMB exploit.**\n\n**This was combined with the heavy use of py2exe to compile Python scripts. This is the first time we have seen**\n**APT28 incorporate this exploit into their intrusions.**\n\n**In the 2016 incident, the victim was compromised after connecting to a hotel Wi-Fi network. Twelve hours**\n**after the victim initially connected to the publicly available Wi-Fi network, APT28 logged into the machine with**\n\n**stolen credentials. These 12 hours could have been used to crack a hashed password offline. After**\n\n**successfully accessing the machine, the attacker deployed tools on the machine, spread laterally through the**\n**victim's network, and accessed the victim's OWA account. The login originated from a computer on the same**\n\n**subnet, indicating that the attacker machine was physically close to the victim and on the same Wi-Fi**\n**network.**\n\n**We cannot confirm how the initial credentials were stolen in the 2016 incident; however, later in the intrusion,**\n**Responder was deployed. Since this tool allows an attacker to sniff passwords from network traffic, it could**\n\n**have been used on the hotel Wi-Fi network to obtain a user’s credentials.**\n\n**Cyber espionage activity against the hospitality industry is typically focused on collecting information on or**\n\n**from hotel guests of interest rather than on the hotel industry itself, though actors may also collect information**\n**on the hotel as a means of facilitating operations. Business and government personnel who are traveling,**\n\n**especially in a foreign country, often rely on systems to conduct business other than those at their home**\n\n**office, and may be unfamiliar with threats posed while abroad.**\n\n**APT28 isn’t the only group targeting travelers. South Korea-nexus Fallout Team (aka Darkhotel) has used**\n**[spoofed software updates on infected Wi-Fi networks in Asian hotels, and Duqu 2.0 malware has been found](http://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-are-using-hotel-wi-fi-to-spy-on-guests-steal-data/)**\n\n**on the networks of European hotels used by participants in the Iranian nuclear negotiations. Additionally, open**\n**sources have reported for several years that in Russia and China, high-profile hotel guests may expect their**\n**[hotel rooms to be accessed and their laptops and other electronic devices accessed.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/russia-monitor-communications-sochi-winter-olympics)**\n\n**These incidents show a novel infection vector being used by APT28. The group is leveraging less secure**\n**hotel Wi-Fi networks to steal credentials and a NetBIOS Name Service poisoning utility to escalate privileges.**\n**APT28’s already wide-ranging capabilities and tactics are continuing to grow and refine as the group expands**\n\n**its infection vectors.**\n\n**Travelers must be aware of the threats posed when traveling – especially to foreign countries – and take extra**\n**precautions to secure their systems and data. Publicly accessible Wi-Fi networks present a significant threat**\n\n**and should be avoided whenever possible.**\n\n**[Additional technical information and details are available to FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence customers through](https://www.fireeye.com/products/isight-cyber-threat-intelligence-subscriptions.html)**\n**our portal.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Posts, Lindsay Smith, Spear Phishing, Targeted Attacks, and Threat Research.**\n\n**Get information and insight on today's advanced threats from the leader in advanced**\n**threat prevention.**\n\n# First Name\n\n Last Name\n\n Email Address\n\n**Executive Perspective Blog**\n\n**Threat Research Blog**\n\n**Products and Services Blog**\n\n**Subscribe**\n\n**Contact Us**\n**+1 888-227-2721**\n\n**Company**\n\n**About FireEye**\n\n**Customer Stories**\n\n**Careers**\n\n**Partners**\n\n**[Investor Relations](http://investors.fireeye.com/)**\n\n**Supplier Documents**\n\n**News & Events**\n\n**Newsroom**\n\n**Press Releases**\n\n**Webinars**\n\n**Events**\n\n\n**Get information and insight on today's advanced threats from the leader in advanced**\n**threat prevention.**\n\n# First Name\n\n Last Name\n\n Email Address\n\n**Executive Perspective Blog**\n\n**Threat Research Blog**\n\n**Products and Services Blog**\n\n**Subscribe**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Technical Support**\n\n**Incident?**\n\n**Report Security Issue**\n\n**Contact Support**\n\n**[Customer Portal](https://csportal.fireeye.com/secur/login_portal.jsp?orgId=00D3000000063LS&portalId=06030000000pSNE)**\n\n**[Communities](https://community.fireeye.com/welcome)**\n\n**[Documentation Portal](https://docs.fireeye.com)**\n\n**Cyber Threat Map**\n\n\n**Copyright © 2017 FireEye, Inc.
