They also used Mimikatz to extract\npasswords that would help with lateral movement.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe researchers found that discovering computers of interest on the network is done by\nscanning for live hosts that have specific ports open.\n\nServices like FTP, SSH, SMB, SQL server, remote desktop, and VNC are targeted because\nthey help move to other computers on the network or indicate a valuable target.\n\n## Dropping Ryuk\n\nAccording to SentinelOne’s [examination, the threat actor profiles each machine to extract](https://labs.sentinelone.com/inside-a-trickbot-cobaltstrike-attack-server/)\nas much useful information as possible. This allows them to take complete control of the\nnetwork and get access to as many hosts as possible.\n\nReconnaissance and pivoting stages are followed by planting Ryuk ransomware and\ndeploying it to all accessible machines using Microsoft’s PsExec tool for executing\nprocesses remotely.\n\nBased on the timestamps, SentinelOne researchers estimate that it took two weeks for the\nattacker to gain access to machines on the network and profile them before executing\nRyuk.\n\n[Vitali Kremez of Advanced Intelligence (AdvIntel) security boutique told BleepingComputer](https://www.advanced-intel.com/)\nthat this average for the “incubation” period is accurate, although it varies from one victim to\nanother.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn some cases, Ryuk was deployed after just one day, while in other instances the fileencrypted malware was executed after the attacker had spent months on the network.\n\nKremez told us that Ryuk infections have slowed down lately, as the threat actor is likely in\na vacation kind of state.\n\nIt is important to note that not all TrickBot infections are followed by Ryuk ransomware,\nprobably because the actors take the time to analyze the data collected and determine if the\nvictim is worth encrypting or not.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[Malicious PyPI package opens backdoors on Windows, Linux, and Macs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-pypi-package-opens-backdoors-on-windows-linux-and-macs/)\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[TrickBot cybercrime group linked to new Diavol ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-cybercrime-group-linked-to-new-diavol-ransomware/)\n\n[Cobalt Strike](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cobalt-strike/)\n[Ryuk](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ryuk/)\n[TrickBot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/trickbot/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
