As usual, we'll break the post down in several points:\n\n[Background](http://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html#Background)\n\n[Diagnosis](http://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html#Diagnosis)\n\n[Analysis](http://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html#Analysis)\n\n[Disinfection](http://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html#Disinfection)\n\n[Prevention](http://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html#Prevention)\n\n[Conclusion](http://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html#Conclusion)\n\nThe variant discussed in this blog post is an older variant, so certain infection mechanisms\nmay have changed, as well as C&C's. The point of this post is to familiarize yourself with ELF\nmalware in a better way - how to diagnose, analyse, remove and finally prevent malware\nfrom infecting your Linux machines. A lot of malware is going around and it's not (all)\nexclusively for Windows machines.\n\n**Background**\nYou may have heard about Linux/Xor.DDoS already, a Linux Trojan with rootkit capabilities\n(belonging to the category of 'ELF malware'). What exactly is an ELF file? According to\nWikipedia:\n\n_In computing, the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF, formerly called Extensible_\n_Linking Format) is a common standard file format for executables, object code, shared_\n_libraries, and core dumps._\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)\n\nIn other words: ELF is to Linux as PE (.exe, .com, .scr, ...) is to Windows and Mach-O to OS\nX.\n\nThere's a nice mini poster available by Corkami as well:\n\n\n-----\n\n[(Source)](https://imgur.com/a/5PdMA#2)\n\nMore information about the ELF format can also be found at the Resources section.\n\nIf you haven't heard about Linux/Xor.DDoS itself already, be sure to read the initial post by\nMalwareMustDie uncovering this malware:\n\n[Fuzzy reversing a new China ELF \"Linux/XOR.DDoS\"](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2014/09/mmd-0028-2014-fuzzy-reversing-new-china.html)\n\nIn short: Xor.DDoS is a multi-platform, polymorphic malware for Linux OS and its ultimate\ngoal is to DDoS other machines. The name Xor.DDoS stems from the heavy usage of XOR\nencryption in both malware and network communication to the C&Cs (command and control\nservers).\n\nThere have been other write-ups about this malware as well, which will be mentioned\n[throughout this article or referenced in the Resources section.](http://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2015/09/notes-on-linuxxorddos.html#Resources)\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nHow do you know you're infected with Xor.DDoS?\n\nFirst and foremost (and obviously), you'll be conducting DDoS attacks from your machine(s)\nto targets chosen by the malware authors.\n\n_Sending of large SYN packets_ [(Source)](http://security.radware.com/uploadedFiles/Resources_and_Content/Attack_Tools/ERT_Alert_Malware_Report.pdf)\n\n[You may use netstat to print any current network/internet connections. Use tcpdump to get a](http://linux.die.net/man/8/netstat)\nmore detailed analysis of which packets you are sending out.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecondly, another indication is seeing processes running with random names and sudden\nnew executable files created in /etc/init.d/ or /usr/bin/ (see example below). New entries will\n[be/are added to your crontab as well (/etc/crontab).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)\n\n_Malware running and its related files_\n\n[You may use any command based on top or on](http://linux.die.net/man/1/top) [ps to check for running malicious processes.](http://linux.die.net/man/1/ps)\nWe will see more in the Disinfection part of this blog post.\n\nThirdly, if you are running the standard OpenSSH server you may see an unauthorised but\nsuccessful login and immediate logout afterwards.\n\n[(Source)](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/02/anatomy_of_a_brutef.html)\n\nThese symptoms should be very clear, even more so if you've already implemented several\nmeasures to protect yourself from potential intruders. If not, then it'll be harder to track the\ninfection origin as well. (but more often than not the SSH credentials of the root users are\nbrute forced.)\n\nTo ensure your machines will not get pwned, be sure to read the Prevention part of this blog\npost.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analysis**\nFirst off, we have to identify how the malware entered the system. Usually, a weak root\npassword is used (like admin or 123456, see [here for a list of tried passwords. Note: huge](http://blogs.cisco.com/wp-content/uploads/SSHPsycho_Passwords.txt)\n_.txt file!) or the attackers are brute forcing their way in. (brute forcing the SSH credentials of_\nthe root user) Another, but less common possibility, is exploiting a vulnerable service that you\nhave running (Apache for example).\n\nThis figure is an excellent visual representation on how it all happens:\n\n[(Source)](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/02/anatomy_of_a_brutef.html)\n\nThis variant copies itself over to /lib/libgcc.so, then creates a copy in /etc/init.d and a\nsymbolic link to /usr/bin. Afterwards a new cron script is created and added to the crontab.\n\nWe will now take a look at one of the samples created - named bmtsfnlgxu.\n(SHA1: b34b6f0ec42a0153c043b0665ec47bf6e5aac894)\n\nEasiest way on Linux is to just use the \"file\" command:\n\nWe can see it's an ELF 32-bit executable for i386 - and it's not stripped.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhy is that last part important? [strip allows you to remove symbols and sections from](http://linux.die.net/man/1/strip)\nchoosen files, which in turn makes it harder to reverse engineer (disassemble) as well. In this\ncase, the file doesn't seem to be stripped, great! For example, we can see the source files\nand get an idea of what this malware does:\n(this will also be shown later on in the video below, using IDA)\n\n[Moving on, we will start by using readelf for some further investigation of the file. We know,](http://linux.die.net/man/1/readelf)\nthanks to the file command, it's an ELF 32-bit executable for i386. Using readelf and\nparameter -h we will be able to gather more information:\n\nThis gives us more information already, for example; the [magic (7F 45 4C 46 for ELF files,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)\n4D 5A for MZ files) [2's complement,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) [little endian, the exact type of the file (an executable;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)\nother types for ELF files may be a relocatable file, a shared object, a core file or processor\nspecific) but most importantly here being the Entry point address, or the start of the program.\n\nIn regards to readelf, using parameter -a we can dump a ton of information, you can find the\n[output of this command on our malware on Pastebin: Xor.DDoS - \"readelf -a\" output](http://pastebin.com/Vw5bst48)\n\n[Note that VirusTotal has added (since November 2014) detailed ELF information in reports](http://blog.virustotal.com/2014/11/virustotal-detailed-elf-information.html)\nas well, which is more or less similar to readelf's output.\n\n\n-----\n\n[To disassemble the file, we can use objdump which allows us to disassemble only those](http://linux.die.net/man/1/objdump)\nsections which are expected to contain instructions (-d parameter) or to disassemble the\ncontents of all sections (-D parameter).\n\n[However, to dive a bit deeper into the malware code, we will be using IDA, a multi-processor](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/)\n[disassembler and debugger and Radare, a well-known (portable) reversing framework. Note](http://www.radare.org/r/)\nthat it will still be a quick glance, as MalwareMustDie has already reported extensively about\n[it as well [1][2][3][4]. Note also that it's always a good idea to analyse malware in a virtual](http://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2014/09/mmd-0028-2014-fuzzy-reversing-new-china.html)\nenvironment (VM).\n\nWe will be using both tools on Windows, but you can just as easily run them on Linux or Mac.\n\nI've made an instruction video on how to use IDA Pro Free to take a quick peek into the file\ndiscussed:\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QzwjSAXsxWc\n\n[Download IDA Pro Free for Windows from here. If you're interested in working more with](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml)\n[IDA, there's a handy list of IDA plugins available here.](https://github.com/onethawt/idaplugins-list)\n\n... And just the same for Radare, where we will discover a bit more - namely the C&C of the\nmalware:\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/l82CSJVL1z8\n\n[Download radare2 for Windows from here. More documentation about Radare can be found](http://www.radare.org/r/)\n[here. There's also a handy cheat sheet available here.](http://www.radare.org/r/docs.html)\n\nNote that the Xor.DDoS variant discussed in this blog uses 2 XOR keys for its (network)\ncommunication, they are the following:\n\nBB2FA36AAA9541F0\nECB6D3479AC3823F\n\nIf you like GUIs, then I have another useful utility: [ELFparser. It will perform a scoring based](http://elfparser.com/)\non several factors, such as shell commands, HTTP functionality and process manipulation.\nFor example, for our file:\n\nYou can see it's scored pretty highly. I wonder what it has to say about the hardcoded IP\naddresses..:\n\n\n-----\n\n_You can also see 8.8.8.8, Google's DNS server_\n\n_and likely used to resolve the C&C domains_\n\nGreat, it was able to extract our C&C servers:\n**103.25.9.228 -** [VirusTotal -](https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/103.25.9.228/information/) [IPvoid -](http://www.ipvoid.com/scan/103.25.9.228/) [DomainTools (whois)](http://whois.domaintools.com/103.25.9.228)\n**103.25.9.229 -** [VirusTotal -](https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/103.25.9.229/information/) [IPvoid -](http://www.ipvoid.com/scan/103.25.9.229/) [DomainTools (whois)](http://whois.domaintools.com/103.25.9.229)\n\nUsing ELFparser you can also look at the ELF header, sections, but also all of its capabilities\nlike Information Gathering and Network Functions for example. It's a handy second-opinion\ntool.\n\nFinally, one last tool which should not be missed when analysing ELF files: a sandbox. We\n[will be using detux, a multiplatform Linux sandbox.](http://detux.org/index.php#)\n\n_Connections to wangzongfacai.com and dsaj2a1.org_\n\nYou have Network Analysis (IPs connected and DNS queries) and Static Analysis (Elf Info\nand Strings). In our example we have connections to wangzongfacai.com, not an unfamiliar\n[domain. View the complete report made by Detux on our file here.](http://detux.org/report.php?sha256=a7669ff64f18f3da019e8d257976ea5ff757ba433b4911206312164d0b4d4049)\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s worth noting that several months ago, I already sent a file to Detux (and VirusTotal) which\nyielded similar results:\n\n_3000uc.com, another familiar player - and again dsaj2aX_\n\nDetux report of that file [here. When I sent the latter file to VirusTotal several months ago, it](http://detux.org/report.php?sha256=117fbf3fcbc607a5034c1e4438b9253ad0f7ed897993e943ecb30be6f10879ba)\n[only had 12 detections, after re-submitting it had 19 detections. That's better but we're still](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/117fbf3fcbc607a5034c1e4438b9253ad0f7ed897993e943ecb30be6f10879ba/analysis/)\nnot there.\n\n_[Just a visual representation of detection difference. Read this for info.](http://blog.virustotal.com/2012/08/av-comparative-analyses-marketing-and.html)_\n\nYou may find an overview of all gathered files as well as most common/recurring domains\n[and their IPs they connect to/download from here, available via AlienVault's OTX.](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/560559844637f21ecf297f9a/)\n\nThat's it for our Analysis section, let's move on to Disinfection.\n\n**Disinfection**\nMost importantly, you'd of course like to remove/disinfect this malware completely. Some\npointers:\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Identify malicious processes: run ps ef (ps stands for process status) to see which](http://linux.die.net/man/1/ps)**\n[processes are running. Alternatively, you can use top or again ps with other](http://linux.die.net/man/1/top)\nparameters, for example ps ej or ps aux for a more complete, human readable table.\nLook for processes with random names; in our example it started with S90 and random\nletters afterwards, linked to files with all random names, as is the case in our example\nmalware named bmtsfnlgxu.\n\nOnce you've identified the malicious process(es), you can use the following command\nto find related files as well: for pid in $(ps -C -o pid=); do ls -la /proc/$pid/fd; done\nWhere is the name of the suspicious process. This command will display any open,\nrelated files.For example, for bmtsfnlgxu it would be:\n**for pid in $(ps -C bmtsfnlgxu -o pid=); do ls -la /proc/$pid/fd; done**\n\n**Identify malicious files: look for newly created files in /etc/init.d/, /boot/ and**\n**/usr/bin/. Again, look for files with random names. You may also use the command ls -**\n**lat | head to view recently changed files.**\n\nCheck your crontab (/etc/crontab). Delete the malicious cron jobs, more specifically\nthe cron.hourly jobs and in the case of Xor.DDoS they will be the following:\n\n_*/3 * * * * root /etc/cron.hourly/cron.sh_\n_*/3 * * * * root /etc/cron.hourly/udev.sh_\n\nDelete these two lines from your crontab. Don't forget to save. Delete the related files,\nlocated in /etc/cron.hourly. In our case, their content was as follows:cron.sh\n\n**_udev.sh_**\n\nAs said earlier, delete these files manually, as well as the file(s) mentioned in the scripts. (in\nthis case: /lib/libgcc.so.bak, /lib/libgcc.so and /lib/libgcc4.4.so.) Note that these files are\nnot related to [GCC's runtime library and thus can be safely deleted. It's just another way how](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Libgcc.html)\nthe malware tries to hide itself.\n\nAlso double-check there are no malicious files or scripts in /etc/rc.d. If so, remove them as\nwell.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Stop and kill malicious processes: identify the parent process; usually it will be the**\none consuming the most CPU (which you can verify using any of the earlier\ncommands, top being the easiest). Firstly, be sure to stop the parent process and wait\nfor the child processes to die. Use the command: kill -STOP $pid\n\nWhen the child processes are dead, kill the parent by using: kill -9 $pid\n**Note: in case you see any other malicious processes, go through the last 2 commands**\nagain.\n\n**Delete any leftover malicious files: locations where the malware may reside have**\nbeen indicated before, but to be complete:\n\n**/ (root directory, in rare cases)**\n**/bin/**\n**/boot/**\n**/etc/init.d/**\n**/etc/rc.d**\n**/etc/rcX.d (where X is a number)**\n**/lib/**\n**/lib/udev/**\n**/sbin/**\n**/tmp/**\n**/usr/bin/**\n\nThat's it. Some additional tips and tricks:\n\nUse **[rm -rf to permanently remove a file. Be careful with this command.](http://linux.die.net/man/1/rm)**\nHaving troubles removing a file? Are you root? If not, try killing a process or deleting a\nfile using root by prepending sudo before your command. For example: sudo kill _STOP $pid_\n\nMalicious process keeps coming back? Go over the steps again, but this time note\ndown where the malware resides. Make that directory and its files unmodifiable by\nmaking use of the [chattr command. For example, malware is being recreated in](http://linux.die.net/man/1/chattr)\n_/usr/bin/. Use the command: chattr -R +i /usr/bin/ Then, stop the parent, wait for the_\nchildren to die and kill the parent. Remove the files. Don't forget to use chattr again\nafter you cleaned the infection. (in our example: chattr -R -i /usr/bin/)\n\nIt's also possible the malware is temporarily storing files into /tmp/ while you are trying\nto kill its processes. When that happens, use the same chattr command on the /tmp/\ndirectory and start over. If you are in doubt, use that chattr command on all\naforementioned directories and start over. Very important: do not forget to use chattr R -i on them afterwards!\n\n\n-----\n\nIn rare cases, the attacker may still be connected to your box. If possible, cut the\ninternet connection and go over the disinfection steps. If this is not possible, firstly stop\nSSH by entering the command:\n**sudo /etc/init.d/ssh stop**\n\nThen, use [iptables to drop any connection to the IPs the malware is connecting to (use](http://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables)\nnetstat for example, see also Diagnosis) and to drop any connection from the attacker\nor cybercriminal. How to do this:\n\nIn our example, we learned that our C&C's were 103.25.9.228 and 103.25.9.229. Thus,\ntype or copy/paste these 2 commands:\n**iptables -A OUTPUT -d 103.25.9.228 -j DROP**\n**iptables -A OUTPUT -d 103.25.9.229 -j DROP**\n\nTo block connection(s) from the attacker (you can find the attacker's IP using netstat\nfor example):\n**iptables -A INPUT -s $attackerIP -j DROP**\n\nDon't forget to save your freshly created iptables rules by using the command\n**/etc/init.d/iptables save**\n\nAfterwards, change all passwords. (SSH, your user, root)\n\nBest case scenario here is obviously:\n\nrestoring from a backup\nif the machine is virtual, restore to a previous snapshot\n\nWhen you have either of these available, don't forget to change all passwords afterwards to\nprevent re-infection - and patch your machine(s)!\n\nSome Xor.DDoS variants may also incorporate a rootkit. In that case, hope you have a \"best\ncase scenario\" available to you. Once a box is fully compromised, it may be hard to reinstate\nit back to normal or its original state.\n\n[For double-checking for rootkits and other malware, you may want to check out chkrootkit or](http://www.chkrootkit.org/)\nalternatively, [rkhunter. Additionally, you may download and install an antivirus, for example](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rkhunter/)\n[ClamAV.](http://www.clamav.net/index.html)\n\nIf you perform manual clean-up as indicated above and have confirmed all is in order again,\nyou can install ClamAV and perform an extra scan to be sure. Better be safe than sorry.\nThen, follow the prevention tips below to stay safe.\n\n**Prevention**\n\n\n-----\n\nUse strong passwords for SSH or use keys instead of passwords for authentication.\n[You can read how to do that here. In the unlikely event of you not needing SSH to a](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-authenticate-over-ssh-with-keys-instead-of-passwords/)\nparticular machine, disable it on that machine by:\n**sudo apt-get remove openssh-server**\n\nTo disable it from starting up you can use:\n**update-rc.d -f ssh remove**\nDon't open the incoming SSH port (default 22) to ANY, but rather restrict it to trusted IP\naddresses.\n[For more information about safely using SSH, see: SSH: Best practices](https://blog.0xbadc0de.be/archives/300)\nUse a strong firewall. In Linux there are many options, iptables is a solid choice. A\n[good basic iptables howto can be found here. In a network or if you need to protect](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo)\nseveral machines, you may want to consider a seperate hardware appliance as your\nfirewall/UTM/... of choice.\nIptables can do a very decent job once properly configured. In case you want to do less\n[manual work, I advise to check out sshguard or](http://www.sshguard.net/) [artillery. Both can monitor and alert you](https://github.com/trustedsec/artillery/)\nwhen something funky happens. In the context of our blog post, it also looks for &\n[protects against SSH bruteforce attempts. Another application to consider is fail2ban.](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban)\n[An additional tool is snort. For more information about these tools, refer to their pages.](https://www.snort.org/)\n\n[Consider using SELinux. Security-Enhanced Linux is a compulsory access control](http://linux.die.net/man/8/selinux)\nsecurity mechanism provided in the kernel.\n\nConsider locking down cron jobs to only certain users. To deny all users from using\ncron you can use:\n**echo ALL >>/etc/cron.deny**\n[Consider disabling remote root login. Read how to do that here.](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/security-tip-disable-root-ssh-login-on-linux/)\n[If you browse a lot, consider using NoScript as well.](https://noscript.net/)\nKeep your software and applications up-to-date, as on any system.\nConsider installing an antivirus as second opinion or at least as an additional layer.\nThis is not a necessity but may come in handy. I recommend [ClamAV.](http://www.clamav.net/index.html)\nDon't forget to protect other appliances that may be running on *nix systems, for\n[example your router (and nowadays, IoT devices). Upgrade the firmware as soon as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things)\npossible and change the default root/admin password(s). Install updates/patches for\nyour particular firewall/UTM/... as well.\nFor even more (general) tips on hardening your Linux system (not against Xor.DDoS in\nparticular):\n[20 Linux Server Hardening Security Tips](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-security.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\nDon't be fooled: Linux malware very much exists and starts to become more prevalent.
