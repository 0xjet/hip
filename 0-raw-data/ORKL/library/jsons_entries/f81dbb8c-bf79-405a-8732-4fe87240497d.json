Stroz Friedberg has tracked some of\nthe activities tied to this threat group going back to January 2020. It has been widely reported that this threat group used the\n[SUNBURST backdoor to gain initial access to victim networks. However, Stroz Friedberg is investigating incidents where the same](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\nthreat group gained initial access through alternative means, without any evidence of SUNBURST use.\n\nBased on open-source reporting, a common theme associated with this threat group is its focus on victims’ email data – be it in\n[O365](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2021/01/malwarebytes-targeted-by-nation-state-actor-implicated-in-solarwinds-breach-evidence-suggests-abuse-of-privileged-access-to-microsoft-office-365-and-azure-environments/) [or](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-statement-solarwinds-update) [on-premise](https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-statement-following-treasury-and-irs-briefing-on-solarwinds-hack) [Exchange. On December 13, 2020, Microsoft issued an advisory on this threat group detailing the tactics that](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nenabled persistent long-term access to users’ email in Office 365 (“O365”) – specifically by adding the application-level\npermissions “Mail.Read” or “Mail.ReadWrite” to cloud applications in Azure.\n\nIn this post, we’re going to enumerate (1) the attack chain wherein the threat group gains long-term access to all users’ mailboxes\nwithin an O365 tenant and (2) the evidence sources that track such activity.\n\n## Attack Chain\n\nA crucial component needed to gain long-term persistent access to read all users’ mailboxes in O365 is access to an administrator\naccount in Azure Active Directory. This is especially easy for a threat group to accomplish when an administrator account is not\nprotected by multi-factor authentication (“MFA”). Even in cases where MFA is implemented, this threat group has taken steps to\nbypass MFA. In our investigations, the threat group took the following steps:\n\n1. Compromise administrator account credentials and/or forge authentication tokens for an administrator account and log into\n\nthe account.\n2. Modify existing Azure applications to add “Mail.Read” or “Mail.ReadWrite” application permissions.\n[3. Create a client secret to enable “client credentials grant” authentication to modified Azure applications with the newly added](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)\n\npermissions.\n4. With access to (1) the client ID of the targeted Azure application, (2) the Azure tenant ID and (3) the client secret, connect to\n\nvictim’s Azure tenant via the registered application to read email from any mailbox in the tenant.\n\n\n-----\n\nSample threat workflow involving modification of Azure application permissions\nIt’s helpful to visualize this and walk through an example scenario. When an application is registered in Azure, a delegated\npermission “User.Read” is automatically assigned to the application. In Azure, delegated permissions differ from application\n[permissions as described by Microsoft below:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent)\n\n**_Delegated Permissions: Delegated permissions are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, either the_**\n_user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests. The app is delegated permission to act as the signed-_\n_in user when it makes calls to the target resource._\n\n**_Application Permissions: Application permissions are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present, for example, apps_**\n_that run as background services or daemons. Only an administrator can consent to application permissions._\n\nIn this example, suppose the organization also adds the permission “Dataset.ReadWrite.All” for their purposes. Once a threat\ngroup gains access to Azure using an administrator account, they can add an application permission like “Mail.Read” to this\nexisting application in Azure. Adding this permission will not impact the legitimate usage of the application by the organization, and\nas a result may go undetected. Upon adding the “Mail.Read” permission, the threat group can then create a client secret to\nauthenticate to this application. Armed with the client ID, tenant ID and the client secret, the threat group can now connect to Azure\nand read all email via an external application. That external application could be a commercial product designed to export mail\nfrom O365 or could be a custom application to pull mail via the Microsoft Graph API. Alternatively, the threat group could register a\nnew application of their own to Azure as a method of persistent access. This method is much more likely to be detected,\ndepending on the tenant configurations and diligence of the organization.\n\nAs an example, issuing an HTTP GET request like GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages would result in retrieving all\nemail messages for a specific user. A list of Graph API methods that can be used is documented by Microsoft [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-messages?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)\n\nUsing the Microsoft Graph API, a threat group can also issue requests based on certain filters. For example, they can retrieve all\nemails within a tenant that contain specific keywords such as “PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL” in the body of an email.\n\nAs a proof of concept, Stroz Friedberg created an external application called “MailFetch” that takes as inputs client ID, tenant ID\nand the client secret and issues Microsoft Graph API requests through the registered Azure application associated with the client\nID. To manage the output and to prevent reading all email within the tenant, the application takes as an input a “username” which\nis used as a filter. Using MailFetch, you can verify that the “Mail.Read” permission grants read access to all users’ mailboxes.\n[MailFetch is publicly available on our GitHub page.](https://github.com/strozfriedberg/msgraph-mailfetch)\n\nOrganizations impacted by this threat workflow may be interested to know the following data that was accessible through the\nGraph API permission “Mail.Read” during our testing:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Message__body__content\n2. Message__body__contentType\n3. Message__bodyPreview\n4. Message__conversationId\n5. Message__conversationIndex\n6. Message__flag__flagStatus\n7. Message__from__emailAddress__address\n8. Message__from__emailAddress__name\n9. Message__hasAttachments\n10. Message__importance\n\n11. Message__inferenceClassification\n12. Message__internetMessageId\n13. Message__isDraft\n14. Message__isRead\n15. Message__isReadReceiptRequested\n16. Message__parentFolderId\n17. Message__receivedDateTime\n18. Message__replyTo__emailAddress__address\n19. Message__replyTo__emailAddress__name\n20. Message__sender__emailAddress__address\n21. Message__sender__emailAddress__name\n22. Message__sentDateTime\n23. Message__subject\n24. Message__toRecipients__emailAddress__address\n25. Message__toRecipients__emailAddress__name\n26. Message__webLink\n27. Message__changeKey\n28. Message__createdDateTime\n29. Message__lastModifiedDateTime\n30. Message__id\n31. Message__isDeliveryReceiptRequested\n32. Attachments__contentBytes\n33. Attachments__contentType\n34. Attachments__isInline\n35. Attachments__lastModifiedDateTime\n36. Attachments__name\n37. Attachments__size\n38. Attachments__id\n39. Attachments__contentId\n40. Attachments__contentLocation\n\nAs we see from the email properties exposed above, a threat group using an Azure application with the “Mail.Read” application\npermission has access to the body of the email, email senders/recipients and attachments in addition to other email properties.\n\nAs mentioned in the example scenario, the threat group is also able to filter on email properties to retrieve only emails of interest.\nPer Microsoft’s [documentation, filters can be applied to the following properties:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters#search-parameter)\n\n1. attachment\n2. bcc\n3. body\n4. cc\n5. from\n6. hasAttachment\n7. importance\n8. kind\n9. participants\n10. received\n\n11. recipients\n12. sent\n13 size\n\n\n-----\n\n14. subject\n15. to\n\n[Examples on how these HTTP requests can be crafted can be found here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters#search-parameter)\n\n## Detection Mechanisms\n\n[On December 16, 2020, Microsoft released Azure Sentinel queries that detect the Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (“TTPs”)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/solarwinds-post-compromise-hunting-with-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1995095)\nmentioned in this post, including but not limited to: (1) the creation of service principals; and (2) addition of permissions to\napplications. Leveraging these, Stroz Friedberg recommends organizations review the following areas to detect the attack chain\ndetailed above.\n\n### Sign-in Activity\n\nWhen investigating sign-in activity for this attack chain, focus on sign-ins to Office 365 and Azure Service Principals.\n\nAs with any investigation into malicious activity in Office 365, look out for user sign-ins that originate from anomalous IP addresses,\nespecially those from anonymization services. Administrator accounts are of particular interest since these are the accounts that\ncan modify cloud applications in Azure. Gaining access to an administrator account is the first step in this attack chain.\n\nIn addition to common methods such as phishing or credential stuffing, one potential avenue for O365 account compromise that\nthis threat group has been known to use is SAML token forgery. If the threat group has stolen the SAML-signing certificate from the\norganization’s network, or added their own certificate to the tenant, they can sign their own tokens to impersonate any user in the\n[tenant, including administrator accounts. A January 2021 CISA alert addressing ways to detect malicious activity in Azure notes a](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\nspecific “UserAuthenticationValue” of 16457, which is described as an indicator of potential SAML forgery. Looking for non-guest\nusers whose sign-in events in the Unified Audit Log contain this value could identify sign-ins that have used forged SAML tokens.\n\nAdditionally, Service Principal sign-ins should be reviewed for unauthorized activity. These events can be found in the Azure Active\nDirectory portal under Sign-Ins. Within Azure Sentinel, this data is tracked in a table named “AADServicePrincipalSigninLogs”,\nwhich displays the source IP address that the sign-in attempt originated from. As with Office 365 user logins, anomalous IP\naddresses could be indicative of compromise.\n\nPlease note that AADServicePrincipalSigninLogs is only enabled in Azure Sentinel when diagnostic logging is enabled on the\n[workspace. Microsoft has listed the steps to enable diagnostic logging here.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/solarwinds-post-compromise-hunting-with-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1995095)\n\n### Modifications to Azure Applications\n\nA core component of these types of attacks involves modifying existing applications with additional permissions. There are two\nways to detect this, (1) via the Unified Audit Log which shows historical activity (retention will vary depending on the environment),\nand (2) the active application-level permissions within Azure.\n\n### Unified Audit Log\n\nOrganizations should review operations in the Unified Audit Log that relate to application creations, changes, and deletions. Any of\nthe following Unified Audit Log events could indicate changes to an Azure application:\n\n1. Update application.\n2. Consent to application.\n3. Add OAuth2PermissionGrant.\n4. Add app role assignment to service principal.\n5. Add app role assignment grant to user.\n6. Add service principal.\n7. Update service principal.\n8. Update application.\n9. Update application – Certificates and secrets management\n\nAlthough each operation is formatted slightly differently, you will most often find the Application/Service Principal name in the\n**AdditionalDetails portion of the log; specifically, under the targetname attribute.**\n\nA User Agent attribute can also be found in the AdditionalDetails section of the log entry which can also be used as a potential\nindicator of compromise, the exact attribute name is “User-Agent”.\n\n### Audit of active application level permissions in registered Azure Apps\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to a review of the Unified Audit Log, Stroz Friedberg also recommends an audit of active application-level permissions\nassigned to registered Azure applications to ensure there is no active compromise.\n\nApart from email access via an Azure application with “Mail.Read” or “Mail.ReadWrite” permissions, threat actors could plausibly\nadd other application-level permissions such as “Sites.Read.All” or “Files.Read.All” which would grant read access to documents\nstored on all SharePoint/OneDrive sites in the organization.\n\nTo review these application permissions within Azure, one can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Go to the [Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)](https://portal.azure.com/)\n2. Search for Enterprise Applications, and navigate to the page\n3. Select the application to review\n4. On the left-hand side, select Permissions\n5. Look for permissions that are potentially overinclusive such as Mail.Read permissions. If the Type is labeled as “Application”\n\nthis indicates that there is potential for global read abilities.\n\nSee below for an example of an application with malicious “Mail.Read” permissions added:\n\nAzure application with “Mail.Read” permissions\n[If you have more than a couple of applications in Azure, Stroz Friedberg recommends using Sparrow, a tool created by](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow)\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”), to perform this audit across all applications in your Azure tenant. Upon\nsuccessful execution, this tool creates a report called “ApplicationGraphPermissions.csv” that contains all the application-level\npermissions assigned to applications in Azure.\n\n[A list of all application-level graph permissions can be found in Microsoft’s documentation here. If a compromised application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference)\ncontains unexpected permissions that could access Mail, Sites or Files, Stroz Friedberg recommends reviewing the Unified Audit\nLog for associated activities. Below is advice on identifying access to mail by a compromised application.\n\n### Emails Accessed through Compromised Application\n\nIn some cases, organizations can determine the exact emails that were accessed via the compromised Azure application. To\nperform this analysis, organizations must already have premium Office 365 E5 subscriptions. Only users that were already\nassigned the Office 365 E5 license will be eligible for this investigation. Enabling E5 licenses at the start of the O365/Azure\ninvestigation will not provide historical data.\n\nTo start this workflow, organizations will need to get the Application ID of the application(s) deemed compromised.\n\n**To find the Application ID:**\n\n1. Go to the [Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)](https://portal.azure.com/)\n2. Search for Enterprise Applications, and navigate to the page\n3. Select the application you have deemed as compromised\n4. Select Properties on the left-hand side of the screen\n5. Note and save the Application ID; this will be needed later.\n\nSee below for an example of the Application Properties page and location of Application ID:\n\n\n-----\n\nSample of\n\nan Application ID from https://portal.azure.com\nWith the Application ID documented, use the ID to determine all emails accessed by the application.\n\n**Unified Audit Log / Mailbox Audit Log Analysis**\n\n[Within the Unified Audit Log and Mailbox Audit Logs, analyze the “MailItemsAccessed” operation. Both the Unified Audit Log and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide)\n[Mailbox Audit Logs contain this operation, and the client ID can be found in the “ClientAppID” field.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailboxauditlog?view=exchange-ps)\n\nSee below for a sample of attributes found in one MailItemsAccessed Unified Audit Log entry (values shown below are randomized\nor generic). Stroz Friedberg identified the user agent “Client=REST;Client=RESTSystem;;” utilized across multiple cases,\nhowever it is possible the threat actor could utilize a different user agent in other environments.\n\nHighlighted in red is the compromised client application ID. Highlighted in blue are the Internet Message IDs of emails accessed –\nmultiple messages may be aggregated into one MailItemsAccessed event. These Internet Message IDs can then be correlated to\nmetadata within acquired mailboxes to extract the exact emails accessed.\n\n**Attribute Name** **Value**\n\n**CreationTime** 2021-01-01T12:00:00\n\n**Id** a123bcde-1a2b-3c4c-1234-abcde12f34g5\n\n**Operation** MailItemsAccessed\n\n**OrganizationId** abcdef-7247-92fj-b184-24789fde193e\n\n**RecordType** 50,”ResultStatus” Succeeded\n\n**UserKey** 123456789A12345\n\n**UserType** 0,”Version” 1,”Workload” Exchange\n\n\n-----\n\n**UserType.Version** 1\n\n**UserType.Workload** Exchange\n\n**UserId** jane.doe@YourDomain.com\n\n**ClientAppId** **8db2c6d7-1abc-123a-a123-ab12cd34567e**\n\n**ClientIPAddress** 168.63.129.16\n\n**ClientInfoString** Client=REST;Client=RESTSystem;;\n\n**ExternalAccess** FALSE\n\n**ExternalAccess.InternalLogonType** 0\n\n**ExternalAccess.LogonUserSid** S-1-2-34-1234567891-234567890-123456789-12345678\n\n**MailboxGuid** a12345bc-67d8-1234-56ef-1234g567h890\n\n**MailboxOwnerSid** S-1-2-34-1234567891-234567890-123456789-12345678\n\n**MailboxOwnerUPN** jane.doe@YourDomain.com\n\n**OperationProperties.MailAccessType** Bind\n\n**OperationProperties.IsThrottled** FALSE\n\n**OrganizationName** YourDomain.com\n\n**OriginatingServer** AB1CD2345EF3456 (12.34.5678.901)u111bu222c\n\n**SessionId** 12a34567-1234-123b-a12b-a123bcd45e6f\n\n**Folders.FolderItems.InternetMessageId** **<12345678a1b2345c1a12345ab1a12ab@EXCH01.YourDomain.com>**\n\n**Folders.FolderItems.InternetMessageId** **<43215678a1b2345c1a12345ab1a12ab@EXCH01.YourDomain.com>**\n\n**Folders.FolderItems.InternetMessageId** **<34565678a1b2345c1a12345ab1a12ab@EXCH01.YourDomain.com>**\n\n**Folders.FolderItems.InternetMessageId** **<22345678a1b2345c1a12345ab1a12ab@EXCH01.YourDomain.com>**\n\n**Folders.FolderItems.Id** LgAAAAB1aABCDefABCDEFgHIj1aABCD+AbBcdEFGHiJ1aB1CDEFGHIJKLM1ABCD\n\n**Folders.Path** Inbox\n\n**Folders.OperationCount** 4\n\n**ResultIndex** 1\n\n**ResultCount** 4500\n\n**Identity** a123bcde-1a2c-3d4e-1234-a1ab123a45b6\n\n**IsValid** TRUE\n\n**ObjectState** Unchanged\n\nSample MailitemsAccessed\n\nMailItemsAccessed logging does have some limitations; for instance, if an account has over 1,000 items accessed in a single day,\nMailItemsAccessed logging will pause for the next 24 hours.
