Unfortunately,\nmany malware distributors have taken notice and are now using OneNote to deliver\nmalicious files to their victims. These actors attach malicious files to a page within OneNote\nand then share it with their targets as a .one file. The ONE file reaches its targets through\nphishing emails. Upon opening the attachment, the victim’s computer is compromised.\n\n_Figure 1: Overview_\n\n_of OneNote Malware Campaign_\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe inclusion of the MoTW flag and disabling macros in Microsoft Office applications has\nresulted in a notable reduction in the use of MS Word and other executables for distributing\nmalware. OneNote enables its users to attach files without constraints, making it a\nconvenient means for TAs to deliver malicious payloads. To address this concern, Microsoft\nhas introduced a warning dialog box that prompts users when attempting to open an\nattachment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Evolution in Malware Distribution_\n\n**How TAs are using OneNote**\n\n[OneNote malware campaign is propagated via phishing emails, with Emotet being the latest](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-now-distributed-in-microsoft-onenote-files-to-evade-defenses/)\nmalware to take part in this campaign. The attackers employ a tactic of deception by\ndisplaying a counterfeit button, concealing the actual harmful attachment underneath it.\nVictims are lured into clicking the button with the promise of accessing the document upon\n[clicking the fake button. Nviso Labs also reported the use of embedded URLs by the TAs to](https://blog.nviso.eu/2023/03/27/onenote-embedded-url-abuse/)\ndeliver their payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors have been disseminating the malware by using various file types as\nattachments. Our findings reveal that the primary purpose of these attachments is to\ndownload and execute the intended malware. Presented below is a list of some file\nextensions that the TAs favor.\n\n.bat\n.js\n.cmd\n.wsf\n.ps\n.lnk\n.exe\n.hta\n.vbs\n\n[One noteworthy technique that was observed involved the use of Right-to-Left Override to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/002/)\n[masquerade the file extension. The malware has also been seen with double file extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/007/)\nin order to evade detection.\n\nIn late November 2022, Qakbot was observed utilizing OneNote to distribute its malware and\nsince then, numerous threat actors have followed suit, taking advantage of this feature. This\ncampaign has brought together multiple malware families and integrated them into a unified\napproach. Threat actors still continue to incorporate OneNote as a tool in their arsenal for\ndelivering their malware.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the distribution trend of malware by various TAs in the last four\nmonths. OneNote has been extensively used by Qakbot in recent months, which is evident\nfrom the chart. Emotet joined the campaign in March and has been consistently active since\nthen. Meanwhile, AsyncRAT has shown a gradual rise in the number of malwares detected\nover the months, with a halt in March.\n\nThe OneNote Malware Campaign displayed no bias towards specific malware categories as\nit welcomed all types of malwares, including info-stealers and ransomware, with open arms.\n\nA list of some popular malware utilizing the OneNote malware campaign that was observed,\nis provided below.\n\n[IcedID](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.icedid)\n[Emotet](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emotet)\n[Quasar](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.quasar_rat)\n[XWorm](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.xworm)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Malware samples using OneNote can be found in MalwareBazaar, and there are open-](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/one/)\n[source tools developed by DidierStevens and](https://github.com/DidierStevens/Beta/blob/master/onedump.py) [knight0x07 that will be helpful for static](https://github.com/knight0x07/OneNoteAnalyzer)\nanalysis of the .one file format.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the campaign is being spread through emails. An adequate way for\nyour organization to protect itself is by either creating a rule in Microsoft Exchange Online or\nby creating a new Anti-malware policy to block emails containing .one files as attachments.\n\nIf these options are not feasible, you can limit the launching of embedded file attachments in\nOneNote by utilizing Microsoft Office group policies.\n\nCreating an Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rule on `D4F940AB-401B-4EfC-AADCAD5F3C50688A` as shown below will help prevent the execution of OneNote attachments. If\na user tries to open the attachment, they will receive a notification alerting them that the\nadministrator has blocked this action.\n```\nAdd-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids D4F940AB-401B-4EfC-AADCAD5F3C50688A -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions Enabled\n\n```\n**Detection**\n\n[OneNote Malware Campaign can be detected using sigma rules.](https://www.loginsoft.com/blog/2020/06/17/threat-detection-with-sigma-rules/)\n\nThe below rule detects the creation of .one file in users machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nlogsource:\n\n  category: file_event\n\n  product: windows\n\ndetection:\n\n  selection:\n\n    TargetFilename|contains:\n\n      - '\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\'\n\n      - '\\Users\\Public\\'\n\n      - '\\Users\\'\n\n      - '\\Windows\\Temp\\'\n\n      - 'C:\\Temp\\'\n\n    TargetFilename|endswith: '.one'\n\n  condition: selection\n\n```\nAs we highly observed the use of RUNDLL32 for the execution of the malware where the\nattachment was an .hta file. This behavior can be detected using the following rule.\n```\nlogsource:\n\n product: windows\n\n category: process_creation\n\ndetection:\n\n selection_process:\n\n  Image|contains: 'rundll32.exe'\n\n  ParentImage|contains: 'mshta.exe'\n\n  ParentCommandLine|contains|all:\n\n   -
