    "plain_text": "# APT Trends report Q2 2017\n\n**securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2017/79332**\n\nBy GReAT\n\n## Introduction\n\nSince 2014, Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) has been\nproviding threat intelligence reports to a wide-range of customers worldwide, leading\nto the delivery of a full and dedicated private reporting service. Prior to the new\nservice offering, GReAT published research online for the general public in an effort to\nhelp combat the ever-increasing threat from nation-state and other advanced actors.\nSince we began offering a threat intelligence service, all deep technical details on\nadvanced campaigns are first pushed to our subscriber base. At the same time, to\nremain true to our efforts to help make the internet safer, important incidents, such\nas WannaCry or Petya are covered in both private and public reports.\n\nKaspersky’s Private Threat Intelligence Portal (TIP)\n\n[In Q1 of 2017 we published our first APT Trends report, highlighting our top research](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2017/78169/)\nfindings over the last few months. We will continue to publish quarterly reports as a\nrepresentative snapshot of what has been offered in greater detail in our private\nreports in order to highlight significant events and findings we feel most users should\nbe aware of. If you would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request\nmore information for a specific report, readers are encouraged to contact:\n**intelreports@kaspersky.com.**\n\n## Russian-Speaking Actors\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat actors. Topping the list of ‘attention grabbers’ were the Sofacy and Turla threat\nactors.\n\nMarch and April started off with a bang, with the discovery of three zero-day exploits\nbeing used in-the-wild by Sofacy and Turla: two of these targeted Microsoft Office’s\nEncapsulated PostScript (EPS) and the third being a Microsoft Windows Local Privilege\nEscalation (LPE). Sofacy was discovered utilizing both CVE-2017-0262 (an EPS\nvulnerability) and CVE-2017-0263 (LPE) over the Easter holiday, targeting a swath of\nusers throughout Europe. Prior to this attack, Turla was also discovered using CVE2017-0261 (a different EPS vulnerability). Neither actor appeared to deviate from\ntheir usual payload repertoire, with Sofacy dropping their typical GAMEFISH payload\nand Turla utilizing what we refer to as ICEDCOFFEE (a.k.a. Shirime). Targeting for\nthese attacks was also directly within the normal wheelhouse for both actors,\nfocusing mainly on foreign ministries, governments, and other government-affiliated\norganizations.\n\nGReAT produced additional reports on Sofacy and Turla beyond those mentioned\nabove. In April, we notified customers of two new experimental macro techniques\nutilized by Sofacy. These techniques, while not particularly sophisticated, caught our\nattention as they had not been seen before in-the-wild. The first technique involved\nusing the built-in ‘certutil’ utility in Microsoft Windows to extract a hardcoded payload\nwithin a macro. The second technique involved embedding Base64-encoded payloads\nwithin the EXIF metadata of the malicious documents. While the targeting for this\nnew set of activity was again fairly standard, we discovered some noteworthy\ntargeting against a French political party member prior to the 2017 elections. Moving\ninto May and June, we wrote two additional reports of interest involving these two\nactors: the first was an update on the long running “Mosquito Turla” campaign\nshowing the usage of fake Adobe Flash installers and continued targeting of foreign\nMinistries. The other documented yet another update on Sofacy’s unique Delphi\npayload we call ‘Zebrocy’.\n\n[June saw the massive outbreak of a piece of malware dubbed “ExPetr”. While initial](https://securelist.com/schroedingers-petya/78870/)\nassessments presumed that this was yet another ransomware attack à la WannaCry, a\ndeeper assessment by GReAT places the initial intent as constituting an operation\ndestructive in nature. We were also able to confidently identify the initial distribution\nof the malware, as well as indicate a low confidence assessment that the attacks may\nshare traits with the BlackEnergy actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a summary of report titles produced for the Eastern European region only.\nAs stated above, if you would like to learn more about our threat intelligence\nproducts or request more information on a specific report, please direct inquiries to\n**intelreports@kaspersky.com.**\n\n1. Sofacy Dabbling in New Macro Techniques\n2. Sofacy Using Two Zero Days in Recent Targeted Attacks – early warning\n3. Turla EPS Zero Day – early warning\n4. Mosquito Turla Targets Foreign Affairs Globally\n5. Update on Zebrocy Activity June 2017\n6. ExPetr motivation and attribution – Early alert\n7. BlackBox ATM attacks using SDC bus injection\n\n## English-Speaking Actors\n\nEnglish-speaking actors are always particularly fascinating due to their history of\ncomplex tooling and campaigns. Actors like Regin and Project Sauron have proven\nfascinating examples of new techniques leveraged in long-lasting, hard to catch\ncampaigns and as such make ideal subjects for further research. Not to be outdone,\nEquation and the Lamberts were the subjects of our most recent investigations.\n\nContinuing our practice of conducting malware paleontology while integrating new\ndiscoveries, we published a report on EQUATIONVECTOR, an Equation backdoor first\nused as early as 2006. This backdoor is a fascinating passive-active shellcode staging\nimplant. It’s one of the earliest noted instances of a NObody But US (‘NOBUS’)\nbackdoor for staging further attacks. Despite its age, the EQUATIONVECTOR backdoor\n(identified as ‘PeddleCheap’ in the latest ShadowBrokers disclosures) incorporates\nmany advanced techniques for prolonged stealthy operations in victim networks,\nallowing the Equation operators to deliver further payloads without arousing\nsuspicion. The report tracks the development of these tools through subsequent\niterations year-by-year.\n\n\n-----\n\nLambert report in June, the most advanced Lambert known to date. This too is a\nNOBUS backdoor, a passive implant operating strictly in user-land. The intricate\nusefulness of Gray Lambert lies in its ability to orchestrate multiple sniffer victims on\na network via broadcast, multicast, and unicast commands, allowing the operators to\nemploy surgical precision in networks with many infected machines. The sniffers\ndouble as next-stage payload delivery mechanisms for an infected network. A notable\nfeature of the Lambert campaigns is the level of precision with which targets are\nchosen; Gray Lambert’s victimology is primarily focused on strategic verticals in Asia\nand Middle East. During this investigation, GReAT researchers have also discovered\ntwo additional Lambert families (Red Lambert and Brown Lambert) currently under\ninvestigation for Q3. Below is a list of report titles for reference:\n\n1. EQUATIONVECTOR – A Generational Breakdown of the PeddleCheap\n\nMultifunctional Backdoor\n2. The Gray Lambert – A Leap in Sophistication to User-land NOBUS Passive\n\nImplants\n\n## Korean-speaking Actors\n\nOur researchers focusing on attacks with a Korean nexus also had a very busy\nquarter, producing seven reports on the Lazarus group and WannaCry attacks. Most\nof the reports on Lazarus directly involved a sub-group we refer to as BlueNoroff.\nThey are the arm that focuses mainly on financial gain, targeting banks, ATMs, and\nother “money-makers”. We revealed to customers a previously unknown piece of\nmalware dubbed ‘Manuscrypt’ used by Lazarus to target not only diplomatic targets in\nSouth Korea, but also people using virtual currency and electronic payment sites.\nMost recently, ‘Manuscrypt’ has become the primary backdoor used by the\nBlueNoroff sub-group to target financial institutions.\n\nWannaCry also created quite a stir in the second quarter, with our analysts producing\nthree reports and multiple blog posts on this emerging threat. What proved most\ninteresting to us, was the probable linkage to Lazarus group as the source of the\nattacks, as well as the origins of the malware. GReAT researchers were able to trace\nback some of its earliest usage and show that before the ‘EternalBlue’ exploit was\nadded to version 2, WannaCry v1 was used in spearphishing attacks months prior.\nHere is a listing of our reports from Q2 on actors with a Korean nexus:\n\n1. Manuscrypt – malware family distributed by Lazarus\n2. Lazarus actor targets carders\n3. Lazarus-linked ATM Malware On the Loose In South Korea\n4. Lazarus targets electronic currency operators\n5. WannaCry – major ransomware attack hitting businesses worldwide – early alert\n6. WannaCry possibly tied to the Lazarus APT Group\n7. The First WannaCry Spearphish and Module Distribution\n\n## Middle Eastern Actors\n\n\n-----\n\nproduce two reports revolving around the use of a zero-day exploit (CVE-2017-0199).\nThe most notable involved an actor we refer to as BlackOasis and their usage of the\nexploit in-the-wild prior to its discovery. We have previously reported on BlackOasis\nusing other zero-days in the past; CVE-2016-4117 in May 2016, CVE-2016-0984 in June\n2015, and CVE-2015-5119 in June 2015. It is believed that BlackOasis is a customer of\nGamma Group and utilizes the popular ‘lawful surveillance’ kit FinSpy. Other than the\nusage of the exploit, this report was significant because it also showed one of the\nearliest known uses of a new version of FinSpy, which is still being analyzed by our\nresearchers.\n\nAfter the discovery of CVE-2017-0199, a plethora of threat actors also began to\nleverage this exploit in their attacks. We reported to customers on the usage of this\nexploit by a well-known Middle Eastern actor dubbed ‘OilRig’. OilRig has actively\ntargeted many organizations in Israel with the exploit via spearphishes appearing to\noriginate from well-known doctors within Ben Gurion University. While their\nexecution was less than stellar, it highlighted the widespread usage of this exploit\nshortly after its discovery.\n\n1. OilRig exploiting CVE-2017-0199 in new campaign\n2. BlackOasis using Ole2Link zero day exploit in the wild\n\n## Chinese-Speaking Actors\n\nOn the Chinese speaking front, we felt it necessary to produce two reports to our\ncustomers. While Chinese speaking actors are active on a daily basis, not much has\nchanged and we prefer to avoid producing reports on ‘yet another instance of APTxx’\nfor the sake of padding our numbers. Instead we try to focus on new and exciting\ncampaigns that warrant special attention.\n\nOne of those reports detailed a new finding regarding a fileless version of the wellknown ‘HiKit’ malware dubbed ‘Hias’. We have reported on Hias in the past, and one\nof our researchers was finally able to discover the persistence mechanism used,\nwhich also allowed us to tie the activity to an actor we call ‘CloudComputating’.\n\nAnother report detailed a new campaign we referred to as ‘IndigoZebra’. This\ncampaign was targeting former Soviet Republics with a wide swath of malware\nincluding Meterpreter, Poison Ivy, xDown, and a previously unknown malware called\n‘xCaon’. This campaign shares ties with other well-known Chinese-speaking actors,\nbut no definitive attribution has been made at this time.\n\n1. Updated technical analysis of Hias RAT\n2. IndigoZebra – Intelligence preparation to high-level summits in Middle Asia\n\n## Best of the rest\n\n\n-----\n\nreport to our subscribers without being able to make an immediate or definitive\ndetermination on regional provenance. Several reports fell into this category in the\nlast quarter. ChasingAdder is a report describing a new persistence technique that\nhijacked a legitimate WMI DLL for the purposes of loading a malicious payload. This\nactivity targeted high-profile diplomatic, military, and research organizations\nbeginning in the fall of 2016, but to date we have not been able to pinpoint the\nspecific actor responsible.\n\nDemsty is a new piece of MacOS malware that is targeting University researchers in\nHong Kong, among others. At the time of writing, we have a low confidence\nassessment that the campaign was conducted by Chinese-speaking actors, and thus\ncategorize this as ‘Unknown’ until greater evidence comes to light.\n\nDuring Q2, the mischievous ShadowBrokers also continued their regular activities\ndumping multiple tools and documentation allegedly stolen from Equation Group. In\nApril, the ShadowBrokers released another dump of information detailing the alleged\ntargeting of SWIFT service bureaus and other banks by Equation Group. Since some\nof our customers are financial entities, we found it necessary to evaluate the data and\nprovide an expert’s opinion on the validity of the dump.\n\nReports in the ‘unknown’ category:\n\n1. ShadowBrokers’ Lost in translation leak – SWIFT attacks analysis\n2. ChasingAdder – WMI DLL Hijacking Trojan Targeting High Profile Victims\n3. University Researchers Located in Hong Kong Targeted with Demsty\n\n## Predictions\n\nBased on the trends we’ve seen over the last three months, as well as foreseeable\ngeopolitical events, we have listed a few predictions for the upcoming quarter (Q3). As\nalways, this isn’t an exact science and some cases won’t come to fruition. Analyzing\ncurrent and future events and combining those with the motivations of known active\nactors can help organizations prepare for likely forthcoming activity:\n\n1. Misinformation campaigns will remain a threat to countries with upcoming\n\nelections, specifically Germany and Norway, as they have been previous targets\nfor Eastern European based actors.\n2. ‘Lawful Surveillance’ tools will continue to be utilized by governments that don’t\n\nhave well-established Cyber Operations capabilities, mainly based out of the\nMiddle East. Companies such as Gamma Group, Hacking Team, and NSO will\ncontinue to offer new zero-day exploits to those customers. As prices increase\nand exchanges thrive, new organizations and marketplaces will continue\npopping up.\n3. Destructive malware disguised as ransomware will continue to be a problem. In\n\nthe last quarter we’ve seen two instances of this, and with the continued release\nof tools / exploits from dumps like Vault7 and ShadowBrokers, this is going to\nb l i d d l i h\n\n\n-----\n\ngrowth, rising tensions with North Korea and the US, and increased exchanges\nbetween South Korean / Japanese / American organizations. In addition to\nthese, the 19th Party Congress is set to be held in the fall of 2017 and according\nto multiple public predictions, it is likely that some major changes will happen in\nthe leadership. It’s possible that these events will have wide regional influences\nthat could affect the way that threat actors operate in Asia, both in terms of\ntargeting and TTPs.\n5. Targeting energy-related companies and organizations will be on the rise.\n\nCountries such as Norway may be a top target moving forward given their\ncontrol on oil and gas in the region in the buildup to an election. Saudi Arabia\nwill also top the charts for potential targeting as they have in years past.\n6. Lower-tier threat actors continue to increase cyber-espionage efforts and\n\ncapabilities both in complexity and size. Expect more activity with varied\ntechnical capabilities coming from lesser known or previously unseen actors.\n\n## How to keep yourself protected\n\nOne of the biggest problems when it comes to leveraging threat intelligence is judging\nthe quality of the data and how it can be used for defense. For instance, we may\nobserve an increase in the number of fileless attacks or attacks in which all IOCs are\nunique or specific per victim. In such situations, having not only host-based IOCs, but\nalso network IOCs and Yara rules that can help identify malware in all cases is very\nimportant.\n\nAnother problem comes from the fact that many threat intelligence providers have a\nlimited world view and their data covers only a small set of threats. It’s easy for an\nenterprise to fall into the trap of thinking that ‘actor X’ is not something they need to\nworry because their focus has been only certain countries or certain industry sectors;\nonly to discover later that their ignorance left them blind to those attacks.\n\nAs shown by many incidents, but especially by WannaCry and ExPetr’s EternalBluebased spreading subroutines, vulnerabilities remain a key approach to infecting\nsystems. Therefore timely patching is of utmost importance – which, being one of the\nmost tedious IT maintenance tasks, works much better with good automation.\nKaspersky Endpoint Security for Business Advanced and Kaspersky Total Security\ninclude Vulnerability & Patch management components, offering convenient tools for\nmaking patching much easier, and much less time-consuming for IT staff.\n\nGiven the above, it is highly recommended that prevention (such as endpoint\nprotection) along with advanced detection capabilities, such as a solution that can\ndetect all types of anomalies and scrutinize suspicious files at a deeper level, be\npresent on users’ systems. The Kaspersky Anti Targeted Attack solution (KATA)\nmatches events coming from different infrastructure levels, discerns anomalies and\naggregates them into incidents, while also studying related artifacts in a safe\nenvironment of a sandbox. As with most Kaspersky products, KATA is powered by\n\n\n-----\n\nlearning processes coupled with real-time analyst expertise and our understanding of\nthreat intelligence big data.\n\nThe best way to prevent attackers from finding and leveraging security holes, is to\neliminate the holes altogether, including those involving improper system\nconfigurations or errors in proprietary applications. For this, Kaspersky Penetration\nTesting and Application Security Assessment services can become a convenient and\nhighly effective solution, providing not only data on found vulnerabilities, but also\nadvising on how to fix it, further strengthening corporate security.\n\n\n-----",
