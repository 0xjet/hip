    "plain_text": "# APT group Lorec53 (Lori Bear) recently launched a large- scale cyber attack on Ukraine\n\n**blog.nsfocus.net/apt-lorec53-20220216**\n\nFuying Lab\n\n## 1. Summary of the event\n\nRecently, NSFOCUS Fuying Lab has captured a large number of phishing file attacks against\nUkraine, and the associated malicious files include pdf, doc, cpl, lnk and other types. After\nanalysis, we confirmed that this series of fishing activities came from the APT organization\nLorec53 (Chinese name: Lori Xiong). During the period from the end of 2021 to February 2022,\nthe organization used a variety of attack methods to deliver a variety of phishing documents to key\nstate institutions such as the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Finance, embassies, state-owned\nenterprises, and public medical facilities of Ukraine to collect organizational Personnel\ninformation-based network attack activities.\n\n## 2. Organizational Background\n\nLorec53 (Chinese name: Lori Xiong) is a new type of APT organization first identified and named\nby NSFOCUS Fuying Laboratory, active in Eastern Europe. The Ukrainian Computer Emergency\nResponse Center identified the organization as UAC-0056 in a recent report\n(https://cert.gov.ua/article/18419). Fuying Lab found that the group's captureable spy Trojans\nfirst appeared in 2020, and began to organize large-scale cyber espionage attacks against Ukraine\nand Georgia in early 2021.\n\nLorec53 exposed a large number of Russian hacker characteristics in terms of attack tools, domain\nname registration information, asset location, etc., and its attack targets are also closely related to\nRussia's national interests. A study of Lorec53's development trajectory found that the\norganization was suspected of being employed by other high-level espionage organizations to gain\nrevenue by undertaking state-level espionage attacks or selling confidential government\ndocuments.\n\nLorec53 has strong infiltration ability and changeable attack methods. It can organize large-scale\nand high-density phishing attacks. It is also good at learning from other organizations' social\nengineering technology and network resource management methods.\n\nAt present, the victims affected by the Lorec53 attack include users of the National Bank of Iran,\nGeorgia's Epidemic Prevention and Health Department, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, the\nPresidential Office, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Border Guard.\n\nFor more reports related to the organization, please refer to the analysis report of Fuying Lab on\nthe organization (http://blog.nsfocus.net/lorec-53/, http://blog.nsfocus.net/lorec53-nsfocus/,\nhttp://blog.nsfocus.net/apt-lorec/)\n\n## 3 Overview of events\n\n\n-----\n\nLorec53's current round of attacks lasted for a long time, with a wide range of targets, and the\nattack methods had obvious organizational characteristics.\n\nLorec53 continued the previous decoy design methods in this round of attacks, constructing\nphishing including Ukrainian government documents that mask some information, shortcut files\nwith Ukrainian titles and camouflaged extensions, and cpl files with Ukrainian file names. bait,\nand distribute these bait masquerading as a member of a credible organization.\n\n**bait name** **translate**\n\n\nдо рішення Ради національної безпеки і\nоборони України від 7 вересня 2021 року\n\"Про внесення зміни до персональних\nспеціальних економічних та інших\nобмежувальних заходів (санкцій)\"\n\n\nAccording to the decision of the National\nSecurity and Defense Council of Ukraine of\nSeptember 7, 2021 \"On the modification of\nspecial economic and other restrictions on\nindividuals (sanctions)\"\n\n\nПовідомлення про вчинення злочину crime report\n\n\nСкарга на абонента у судовому порядку\n12-01-2022\n\nПетиція щодо повернення майна\nгромадянам України\n\nПриклад заповнення пояснювальної текст\nзаповнюється вручну\n\nРоз'яснення щодо коректності ведення\nелектронних медичних записів в\nелектронній системі охорони здоров'я, а\nпророж\n\n\nComplain to the court orderer 12-01-2022\n\nPetition to return property to Ukrainian\ncitizen\n\nThe example of filling in the description text\nis filled in manually\n\nClarify the correctness of electronic medical\nrecords in the electronic health system, and\nthe impact of the law\n\n\nTable 3.1 Some fishing lures names and translations\n\nIn this series of phishing attacks, Lorec53 attackers mainly used three domain names, 3237.site,\nstun.site, and eumr.site, as download servers for various phishing files. The site domain is one of\nthe commonly used domains of Lorec53. As of February 11, some URLs are still accessible and can\ndeliver payload files, indicating that this round of attacks is still ongoing.\n\nIn this series of attacks, Lorec53 directly wrote the collected mailboxes of key Ukrainian facilities\ninto the decoy text. Judging from Lorec53's past behavior, such an operation may be used to\nincrease the credibility of the bait. This feature also provides a basis for investigators to confirm\nthe attack coverage.\n\nThis time, Lorec53 still uses known Trojan programs, including LorecDocStealer (also known as\nOutSteel), LorecCPL, SaintBot, and packaged these Trojan programs as much as possible.\n\n## 4. Event Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4.1 Attack event one\n\nFirst from phishing attacks occurred in late 2021, Lorec53 constructed a lot to \"до рішення Ради\nнаціональної безпеки і оборони України від 7 вересня 2021 року\" Про внесення зміни до\nперсональних спеціальних економічних та інших обмежувальних заходів (санкцій) \"\" the\ntitle of the fishing documentation. The contents of these phishing documents refer to a presidential\ndecree adopted by the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine on September 7, 2021,\nclaiming that special asset restrictions and sanctions will be imposed on a specific person.\n\nFigure 4.1 Phishing document titled “Restrictions (sanctions) on modification of personal special economics”\n\nAccording to the relevant decrees of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Security Service, the Cabinet and other\nstate departments can modify the document \"Restriction Measures (Sanctions) for Individual\nSpecial Economics and Others\" to add or delete specific economic sanctions. In the amendment on\nSeptember 7, the economic sanctions object numbered 85 was added.\n\nIt should be noted that the content of the phishing file is roughly the same as the content of the\nattachment in the presidential decree published by the Ukrainian government\n(https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/n0062525-21#Text), but the Lorec53 attacker The\nfollowing changes have been made to the text:\n\n1. The use of asterisks obscures specific citizen information;\n\nThis is Lorec53's usual practice when building phishing documents, in this way to lure victims to\nenable the editing function of the document, and then run the macro code in the document\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Added email addresses that do not exist in the original text;\n\nThe Lorec53 attacker added government email addresses to the original citizen information\nwithout fuzzing. After query, the \"DMYTROTSAN@ukr.net\" address in the sample fishing email\ndoes not matter, but point to the Ukrainian Wolin Treasury (головне управління державної\nклужбееіккїї у уобииііііни у іііі їїїїл іі).\n\nThe above two changes indicate that the target of Lorec53's phishing operation is the Ukrainian\ngovernment, and the email address in the phishing email is likely to be the same as the victim's\nemail address. Fuying Lab counted the mailbox information in all captured phishing emails to\nevaluate the impact of this Lorec53 phishing attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mail** **Corresponding institution or enterprise**\n\ndmytrotsan@ukr.net Ministry of Finance of Volin Oblast, Ukraine\n\nemb_sm@mfa.gov.ua Embassy of Ukraine in Serbia\n\nkev_dnipro@post.mil.gov.ua Ministry of Housing and Operations of Dnipro\nOblast, Ukraine\n\nzorkz@mil.gov.ua Joint Operations Command of the Armed Forces\nof Ukraine\n\noffice.skdvs@ks.treasury.gov.ua Ministry of Finance, Skadovsk District, Kherson\nOblast, Ukraine\n\nsadovska-ii@utg.ua UKRTRANSGAZ AG\n\nufg.csc@ufg@.com.ua Ukrainian Financial Group\n\npokrovske_tckspdp@post.mil.gov.ua Staffing and Social Support Center of the Third\nSector, Sinernikivsky District, Dnipropetrovsk\nOblast, Ukraine\n\nzmievkazna@ukr.net Ministry of Finance, Zmiv District, Kharkiv Region,\nUkraine\n\nkuzmych@naftogaz.com Ukrainian Naftogaz Joint Stock Company\n\nzvernmou@ukr.net Department of Civil Work and Access to Public\nInformation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine\n\nperevod@pivdenny.ua Pivdennyi Bank\n\nkevzp@post.mil.gov.ua Press and Information Department of the Ministry\nof Defense of Ukraine\n\ni.kozarovska@ukrburgas.com.ua UkrGasVydobuvannya JSC Branch Ukrburgaz\n\nkanivkamvo@ukr.net Department of Education, Executive Committee,\nKanif City Council, Cherkassy Region\n\nt.litovko@direkcy.atom.gov.ua VP KB ATOMPRILAD DP NAEK ENERGOATOM\n\ntimm93@ukr.net Ministry of Finance of Vasilevka, Zaporozhye\nOblast, Ukraine\n\noffice.cherv@lv.treasury.gov.ua Ministry of Finance of Chervonohrad, Lviv Oblast,\nUkraine\n\nkevplt_kes@post.mil.gov.ua\n\nbabich-ka@utg.ua UKRTRANSGAZ AG\n\nkevplt_zhytlo@post.mil.gov.ua\n\n\n-----\n\ncorruption@direkcy.atom.gov.ua Ukrainian state-owned enterprise \"NNEGC\"\nEnergoatom\"\n\nemb_jp@mfa.gov.ua Embassy of Ukraine in Japan\n\ngenotdel@odessa.gov.ua Odessa Oblast Administration of Ukraine\n\nzoya_skl@ukr.net Ministry of Finance, Oleshandrivka District,\nKirovolad Oblast, Ukraine\n\nruslan.marunia@bank.gov.ua Department of Currency Circulation, National\nBank of Ukraine\n\nmalyshev.tender@ukroboronprom.com Maleshev Plant\n\nemb_pl@mfa.gov.ua Embassy of Ukraine in Poland\n\nirudksu@i.ua Ministry of Finance, Irshava District, Zakarpatia\nRegion, Ukraine\n\nemb_lt@mfa.gov.ua Embassy of Ukraine in Lithuania\n\nemb_fi@mfa.gov.ua Embassy of Ukraine in Finland\n\nabashinao@kv.treasury.gov.ua Ministry of Finance of Kiev, Ukraine\n\n1545@ukc.gov.ua Ukrainian Government Hotline 1545\n\ntetiana.rupcheva@bank.gov.ua Monetary Policy and Market Operations\nDepartment of the National Bank of Ukraine\n\npr@atom.gov.ua Ukrainian state-owned enterprise \"NNEGC\"\nEnergoatom\"\n\n1201_buhg@dmsu.gov.ua Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Immigration Office of\nUkraine\n\nkherson_kev@post.mil.gov.ua Ministry of Housing and Operations of Kherson\nOblast, Ukraine\n\nsholyak27@ukr.net Ministry of Finance of the Transcarpathian State\nof Ukraine\n\noffice@novator-tm.com Ukrainian state-owned enterprise \"Novator\"\n\nmps@industrialbank.ua AKB Industrialbank PAT\n\nv.harchenko@mil.gov.ua\n\nTable 4.1 Email addresses and corresponding organizations in phishing emails\n\nThe associated information of these email addresses shows that the main goal of Lorec53 in this\nphishing attack is early detection and information collection, which is the same as the\norganization's previous activities.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious macro in these phishing documents will download and run the Trojan at\nhttp[:]//3237[.]site/test01.exe. Also associated with this domain is a phishing shortcut file named\n\"Особливі документи СБУ.lnk\" (a special file of the Ukrainian Security Service.lnk), and a known\nLorec53 Trojan named \"08-2021.cpl\" LorecCPL, so The direct correlation of this domain name to\nLorec53 can be confirmed.\n\nFigure 4.2 The main logic part of the LorecCPL Trojan\n\nA malicious shortcut file named \"Особливі документи СБУ.lnk\" was also used by Lorec53 in\nseveral attacks. Lorec53 constructs named \"sadovska-iiutg.ua.zip\", \"feukslpost.mil.gov.ua.zip\",\n\"n.lashevychdirekcy.atom.gov.ua.zip\", \"feukslpost.mil.gov.ua. zip”, etc., and put this malicious\nshortcut file in the same folder as a large number of non-toxic decoy files, expecting the victim to\nrun the malicious file while browsing file by file. This baiting method also fits with Lorec53's\nhistorical approach.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4.3 Decoy zip file directory, red is the malicious shortcut file\n\nFrom the name of the compressed package, it can be seen that the target of this attack is similar to\nand partially overlapped with the aforementioned personal economic sanctions phishing\ndocument, which can be speculated to be the same series of attacks.\n\n### 4.2 Attack event 2\n\nAnother phishing attack occurred between December 2021 and February 2022.\n\nIn early February, Lorec53 produced a series of phishing documents with the theme of\n\"Повідомлення про вчинення злочину\" (criminal report), which were delivered in the form of\npdf vulnerability files and docx malicious macro files.\n\nThe phishing document named \"Повідомлення про вчинення злочину.pdf\" (criminal\nreport.pdf) displayed the words \"please update\" when opened.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4.4 Phishing document titled \"Crime Report\"\n\nThis is the commonly used pdf decoy construction method for Lorec53, the file is used to download\nthe link\nhttps[:]//get.adobe.com.uk.reader.updateadobeacrobatreaderdc.stun[.]site/get.adobe.com.uk.reader/\nTrojan programs corresponding to\nget.adobe.com.uk.reader/get.adobe.com.uk.reader/AdobeAcrobatUpdate.exe. The trojan is a\npackaged LorecDocStealer (also known as OutSteel) trojan, which is used to steal various\ndocument files on the victim's host. The shell wrapping technique used by Lorec53 on this Trojan\nis very common in AgentTesla spyware.\n\nA similar phishing document \"Повідомлення про вчинення злочину (Білоус Олексій\nСергійович).docx\" was opened to display images and textual information with obvious Lorec53\nlure build characteristics.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4.5 Phishing document titled “Crime Report (Belous Alexei Sergeevich)”\n\nThe document is disguised as a document of the investigation department of the Ukrainian\nNational Police. By blocking the image and red prompt information, it induces the victim to click\nthe icon ole object in the document, and then execute the js script, download and run\nhttps[:]//cdn.discordapp[.] Trojan in\ncom/attachments/932413459872747544/938291977735266344/putty.exe. The Trojan is also the\npackaged LorecDocStealer (OutSteel) Trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith reference to the aforementioned attack incident, the unobfuscated email address\no.bilous@ukrtransnafta.com in this document may be the email address of the direct victims of\nthis incident. The affiliate company of this mailbox is UKRTRANSNAFT Joint Stock Company of\nUkraine.\n\nIn addition, the docx phishing document was also captured and published by the Ukrainian\nComputer Emergency Response Center (CERT-UA). In related reports\n(https://cert.gov.ua/article/18419), CERT-UA referred to the Lorec53 organization as the UAC0056.\n\nThrough correlation analysis of the stun.site domain name that appeared in this attack, Fuying Lab\nconfirmed a variety of decoy files released by Lorec53 from December 2021. These files include\n.lnk, .cpl, .rar and other formats, all of which are known decoy forms of Lorec53. The main\nfunction is to obtain and run the subsequent LorecDocStealer (OutSteel) Trojan from stun.site.\n\n### 4.3 Attack event 3\n\nThe third attack incident mainly revolved around the domain name eumr[.]site.\n\nIn early 2, Lorec53 structure called \"Роз'яснення щодо коректності ведення електронних\nмедичних записів в електронній системі охорони здоров'я, а також впливу прави\" (electronic\nmedical system to clarify the validity of electronic medical records, as well as the impact of the law)\nbait, delivered in the form of a zip archive. Based on the name of the decoy, it can be speculated\nthat the file comes from an attack campaign against the Ukrainian medical system, which overlaps\nwith previous Lorec53 targets.\n\nThe malicious shortcut file in the compressed package is a typical Lorec53 phishing lure, used to\ndownload and run the Trojan program located at http[:]//eumr[.]site/up74987340.exe, which is\nthe LorecDocStealer (OutSteel) spy Trojan.\n\nThe file properties show that these decoy files were modified on January 31, 2022.\n\nThe domain names and CnC communication addresses that appeared in this incident can be linked\nto a number of other malicious programs, which are various forms of wrappers for the\nLorecDocStealer (OutSteel) spyware.\n\n## V. Summary\n\nThe multiple attacks discovered this time are all part of the large-scale cyber attack activities\ncarried out by Lorec53 (Lori Bear) in different time periods from the end of 2021 to February 2022\nagainst Ukrainian government departments, the military, and state-owned enterprises. The main\ntargets of these attacks are still early detection and information collection, and they show the\ndistinctive characteristics of Lorec53 at various stages.\n\nThe phishing lures captured this time show that Lorec53 has indeed inherited the organization's\nmercenary hacking characteristics when operating a national-level cyber attack campaign. Lorec53\nwill batch-produce and regularly adjust the content of phishing bait, with flexible download server\n\n\n-----\n\naddresses and CnC addresses, to indiscriminately harass and attack the exposed mailboxes of key\nUkrainian institutions. This large-scale attack idea is similar to Lorec53's early operation idea as\nan email botnet operator.\n\nWith the changes in the situation in Eastern Europe, the activity of cyber espionage activities\nagainst Ukraine has increased significantly recently, and Fuying Lab will continue to pay attention\nto the progress of the activities of the Lorec53 organization.\n\n**Copyright Notice**\n\nThe copyright holder of all contents of the \"Technology Blog\" on this site is NSFOCUS Technology\nGroup Co., Ltd.
