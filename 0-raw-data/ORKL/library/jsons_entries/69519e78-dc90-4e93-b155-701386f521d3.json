YouTube) during the past year. We tracked this particular campaign as well and\nhave observed several high level domains being victim of malvertising with a combined\nmonthly traffic of 1.5 billion visitors.\n\n\n-----\n\nPeople surfing with outdated plugins or browser get infected through a drive-by download\nattack that turns their PCs into bots participating in Ad Fraud.\n\n## Affected sites\n\nDomain name Alexa rank* Monthly traffic**\n\nnews.yahoo.com 65 527\n\nhuffingtonpost.com 88 248\n\naol.com 156 218\n\nweather.com 159 138\n\nsports.yahoo.com 187 188\n\ntmz.com 454 43\n\nnydailynews.com 609 46\n\ntagged.com 611 58\n\nchron.com 736 31\n\nmatch.com 826 35\n\nlegacy.com 1537 22\n\nstartribune.com 3648 5\n\n123greetings.com 3854 12\n\ngaiaonline.com 4462 2\n\nbeforeitsnews.com 4553 7\n\nintellicast.com 4681 13\n\nmom.me 6515 4\n\ncenturylink.net 6580 8\n\nrent.com 12582 2\n\nentertainment.verizon.com 12667 3\n\nwindstream.net 12802 3\n\ntwincities.com 17457 2\n\n\n-----\n\nwebmail.comcast.net N/A N/A\n\nwebmaila.juno.com N/A 3\n\n_* Alexa rank based on Alexa.com data.

End users, of course, but also advertisers and publishers who have to fight\nto defend their legitimacy.\n\nCyber criminals will likely continue to hijack ad networks with malicious code and pocket the\ndividends from hundreds of thousands of successful infections.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis particular campaign is likely to migrate to other controllers or evolve into something else\nsince it is now in the public domain and affected parties are cleaning up and securing their\nsystems.\n\nMalwarebytes Labs will continue to monitor the situation and update you on any new\ndevelopments.\n\n[Special thanks to JP Taggart for providing the external recording system.](https://twitter.com/jean_taggart)\n\n\n-----",
