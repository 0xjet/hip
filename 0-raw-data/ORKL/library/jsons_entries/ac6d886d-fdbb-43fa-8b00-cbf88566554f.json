Due to their\nwidespread use and versatility, they have slowly become one of the most pervasive malware\ndistribution channels among hackers.\n\nIn the newly discovered campaign, the malicious file, named W10DigitalActiviation.exe,\nmimics a simple, one-button unofficial Windows 10 activator. Upon pressing the faux\n“Activate Windows 10” button, victims trigger the download of the BitRATpayload, which is\nthen deployed to %TEMP% as Software_Reporter_Tool.exe,configured to run at excluded\nfrom Windows Defender’s detection mechanisms.\n\nAfter the downloader performs the operations above, it deletes itself from the infected\ncomputer in an attempt to wipe its tracks.\n\nJudging from the campaign’s distribution manner and the presence of Korean characters in\nsome of its code snippets, security experts suspect Korean threat actors are behind the\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\nBitRAT is a notorious remote access trojan (RAT) marketed on underground cybercriminal\nweb markets and forums. Its price tag of $20 for lifetime access makes it irresistible to\ncybercriminals and helps the malicious payload spread.\n\nFurthermore, each buyer’s modus operandi makes BitRAT even harder to stop, considering it\ncan be employed in various operations, such as trojanized software, phishing and watering\nhole attacks.\n\nBitRAT’s popularity arises from its versatility. The malicious tool can perform a wide range of\noperations, including data exfiltration, UAC bypass, DDoS attacks, clipboard monitoring,\ngaining unauthorized webcam access, credential theft, audio recording, XMRig coin mining\nand generic keylogging.\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[industry news](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/tag/industry-news/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Vlad CONSTANTINESCU\n\nVlad's love for technology and writing created rich soil for his interest in cybersecurity to\nsprout into a full-on passion.
