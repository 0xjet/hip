    "plain_text": "# Let's Talk About FlexiSpy\n\n**randhome.io/blog/2017/04/23/lets-talk-about-flexispy/**\n\n23 Apr 2017 · 7 minutes read\n**Introduction: I started this blog post to explain the context of FlexiSpy leaks and show some**\ninformation I have found during my analysis. This information is incomplete and there is still\nplenty analysis of source code or binaries to be done. I have uploaded the source code and\n[binaries on github so that everyone can help with it. I will try to report in this articles the](https://github.com/)\n[publications I have seen on it, but feel free to ping me on Twitter if you see new information](https://twitter.com/tenacioustek)\nor have any question.\n\n## FlexiWho?#\n\nFlexiSpy is one of these companies selling surveillance software to people who want to spy\non their wife/husband/partner (a.k.a. StalkerWare). You think that it is creepy? Well, it is likely\nworse than you imagine. First, there are dozens of companies like FlexiSpy, selling software\nallowing to remotely track everything the other person is doing : emails, calls, chat apps,\n[calendar… The market is so developed that you can even find websites ranking them:](http://www.top10spysoftware.com/)\n\n[And the impact is really awful : a 2015 women’s aid survey showed that 29% of women](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/onlinesafety/)\nexperiencing domestic abuse had a spyware or GPS locator installed on their phone.\n\nFlexiSpy is not even the bigger StalkerWare seller (Mspy seems to have more than one\n[million customers) but they have something specific : in February a Forbes article showed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/02/16/government-iphone-android-spyware-is-the-same-as-seedy-spouseware/)\nthat FlexiSpy is sharing part of its code with a tool called FinFisher, done by a UK-German\ncompany called Gamma International.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Screenshot of FinFisher website...**\n\nFinFisher is also a tool to spy on computers and smartphones but specifically for Law\nEnforcement and Intelligence agencies, and although their website pretends that it is used\nagainst crime, we have seen consistent utilization of this spyware against activists or political\nopponents:\n\nIn March 2011, Egyptian protesters who broke into the headquarters of the Egyptian\nintelligence service found contracts between Gamma Group and the Egyptian\ngovernment\n[Since 2012, it was used several](https://citizenlab.org/2012/07/from-bahrain-with-love-finfishers-spy-kit-exposed/) [times against Bahrain political activists. Gamma](https://bahrainwatch.org/blog/2014/08/07/uk-spyware-used-to-hack-bahrain-lawyers-activists/)\ndenied selling FinFisher to the Bahrain government and stated that their software could\n[have been stolen but leaked Gamma documents later showed that not only Gamma](https://bahrainwatch.org/blog/2014/08/07/uk-spyware-used-to-hack-bahrain-lawyers-activists/)\nsold their product to the Bahraini government but also that they knew that their tool was\nused to target journalists and political dissidents\n[In 2013, Citizen Lab researchers identified FinFisher samples used against political](https://citizenlab.org/2013/03/you-only-click-twice-finfishers-global-proliferation-2/)\ngroups in Ethiopia, in Vietnam and in 25 other countries. An Ethiopian political dissident\n[in exile in London, Tadesse Kersmo, discovered with this report that he was targeted](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/hackers-without-borders)\nand that his computer was successfully compromised with FinFisher.\nIn 2015, Privacy International researchers confirmed the use of FinFisher against\npolitical opponents in Uganda\n\nIn 2015, Citizen Lab researchers scanned the Internet for FinFisher server and identified 33\ncountries using the product:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Map of government suspected to use FinFisher (CitizenLab - 2015)**\n\n## So What?#\n\n[Last week, we learned something interesting : two persons decided that the StalkerWare](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/inside-stalkerware-surveillance-market-flexispy-retina-x)\nbusiness was not ethically acceptable and went after FlexiSpy and another company called\nRetina-X. They found vulnerabilities in their systems, successfully hacked them, stole all their\ninformation and wiped the disks. They finally shared some of their files with Motherboard\njournalists through their SecureDrop instance.\n\n[We learned some interesting facts from the first article published by Motherboard but also in](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/inside-stalkerware-surveillance-market-flexispy-retina-x)\nthe [interview they gave and in the last Motherboard article about FlexiSpy:](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/hackers-why-they-hit-stalkerware-flexispy-retina-x)\n\nFlexiSpy started from a small Thai company called Vervata in 2004, developing\nsoftware until they started a first spying tool for Symbian in 2006. They later started a\ncompany called “Digital Endpoint” selling products to monitor employees.\nThey started a sister company called “RaySoft” selling to Law Enforcement agencies,\nand then a partnership with Gamma in 2011 on this market\nAround 130 000 people had an account on Retina-X or Flexispy platforms\nThe hack was apparently quite easy and exploited a bug in the API\n[The hacker called Leopard Boy (a reference to the classic 1995 Hacker Movie) is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film))\napparently gonna continue targeting companies doing this business : “It’s the beginning\n_of a reign of terror across this entire industry. I’m going to burn them to the ground, and_\n_leave absolutely nowhere for any of them to hide.”_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Map of compromised smartphones with FlexiSpy (motherboard - 2017)**\n\nBut more interesting, the Leopard Boy hacker started yesterday to publish documents and\ncode on [his Twitter account @fleximinx. I have uploaded the source code and binaries on a](https://twitter.com/fleximinx)\ngithub repository and I will go through the interesting information I got from them during the\npast days.\n\n## What did we get?#\n\nSo what did we get in these leaks:\n\nDocuments about the FlexiSpy and sisters companies\n[Source code of Flexispy Android App v1.00.1 and](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/tree/master/1.00.1/_build) [1.00.4](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/tree/master/Cyclops%20-1.00.4)\n[Source code of Blackberry spyware v.1.03.2 (from Jan 2012)](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/tree/master/2012-01-11_v.1.03.2)\n[Source code of iPhone spyware version 4.9.1](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/tree/master/FlexiSPY%20Phoenix%204.9.1)\nBinaries of FlexiSpy malware for all platforms:\n\n### A View Of FlexiSpy Market Strategy#\n\nOne document named Flexi - Battleplan gives an interesting view of FlexiSpy market\nstrategy (the document is from June 2009):\n\n\n-----\n\nSo their strategy focus mainly on buying Adwords, and bid more on Adwords used by their\ncompetitors on which they did an advanced analysis:\n\nThen they define different Adwords campaigns including a creepy one:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also learn that they created a website reviewing spy software (which is not online\nanymore but I bet FlexiSpy had good reviews):\n\n### They Don’t Like Taxes#\n\nTwo documents give also an interesting view on their off-shore strategy, first with the link\nbetween their companies:\n\n\n-----\n\n[But also with a copy of their contract with the notorious Mossack Fonseca laywer firm in the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossack_Fonseca)\n[Seychelles (Monssack Fonseca was the company at the center of the Panama Papers):](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers)\n\n### Installing Cyclops#\n\nCyclops is the name a surveillance tool used by Gamma and FlexiSpy (I don’t know exactly\nwhat is the difference with FinFisher, it may be FlexiSpy internal name), and the install\ndocumentation (from 2011) leaked clearly confirms the collaboration between FlexiSpy and\nGamma :\n\n\n-----\n\n**Introduction of the Install Guide**\n\n**List of Deliverables**\n\nThis documents seems to indicate that FlexiSpy was actually developing Cyclops while\nGamma was reselling it and maintaining it without involvement in the development of the\ntool. But as [@Josephfcox pointed out on Twitter, it is possible that it was a proposal for a](https://twitter.com/josephfcox/status/856007888715862016)\n\n\n-----\n\ncustomer that never happened (I doubt it though).\n\n### And Then Atlantis Arrived#\n\nAtlantis is an enterprise product to monitor employees mobile devices. It seems to be a\nFlexiSpy product in this documentation, but it may be the product which later led to the\ncreation of the Digital Endpoint company:\n\nThese documents also gives an idea of the price (in 2012):\n\n### Android Source Code#\n\nThe [Android source code leaked is for the version 1.00.1 while the Android APKs are in](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/tree/master/1.00.1/_build)\nversion 2.24.3 and 2.25.1m so it seems to be pretty old code.\n\nNevertheless, we can quickly get the IP addresses and domains used by the application\n[(here,](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/blob/master/1.00.1/_build/source/http/test/http_demo/src/com/vvt/httpdemo/HttpDemoActivity.java) [here,](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/blob/master/1.00.1/_build/source/phoenix/test/phoenix_component_test/src/com/vvt/phoenix/prot/test/CSMResumeRequestTest.java) [here or](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/blob/master/1.00.1/_build/source/phoenix/src/com/vvt/phoenix/http/test/DoubleConnectionTest.java) [here):](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/blob/master/1.00.1/_build/source/server_address_manager/src/com/vvt/server_address_manager/ServerAddressManagerImpl.java)\n\n192.168.2.60 and 192.168.2.116 are used as a dev IP\n\n\n-----\n\n58.137.119.227\n\nhxxp://58.137.119.227:880/RainbowCore/gateway/unstructured\nhxxp://58.137.119.227:880/RainbowCore/gateway\n58.137.119.229:\n\nhxxp://58.137.119.229/RainbowCore\nhxxp://58.137.119.229/RainbowCore/gateway\n58.137.119.230\n\nhxxp://58.137.119.230/Core/gateway\nhxxp://www.vervata.com\nhxxp://www.flexispy.com\ntrkps[.]com\n\nhxxp://trkps.com/m.php?lat=%f&long=%f&t=%s&i=%s&z=5\n\nPlease note that all the URLs in the code are in HTTP and not HTTPs :D :\n```\n$ find . -iname \"*.java\" -exec fgrep -iHn \"https://\" {} \\; | wc -l\n0\n\n```\n[@ben_ra started an analysis of the Android source code and binaries here : Part 1 and](https://twitter.com/ben_ra) Part\n2.\n\nAccording to [@PaulWebSec, they achieve persistence by mounting /system as read/write](https://twitter.com/PaulWebSec)\n[and installing the spyware in the system folder (code is here):](https://github.com/Te-k/flexidie/blob/master/Cyclops%20-1.00.4/application-main/src/com/fx/InstallingService.java)\n\n[Funny.
