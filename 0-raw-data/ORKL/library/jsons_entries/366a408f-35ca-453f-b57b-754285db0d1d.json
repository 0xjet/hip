Cybercriminals often use it to extract data that\nthey can use to financially exploit their victims. This data can range from financial data to\nhealth records, personal emails and passwords; the possibilities of what kind of information\ncan be compromised are endless. Digitization is increasing day by day and so are cyber\nattacks, scams and malware attacks. Although users take many security measures to protect\nthemselves from such attacks, hackers find various ways to penetrate users’ devices.\n\nNow, cybersecurity researchers have issued an important warning to Telegram users:\nDevices and PCs are being hacked by Windows-based malware that spreads via fake\nTelegram Messenger app installers. Malware can hide from installed antivirus systems, steal\n\n\n-----\n\nyour data and download other malicious files to the system. In this way, many users may not\nknow that their device is already infected. ToxicEye is a type of malware called a Remote\nAccess Trojan (RAT). RATs can allow an attacker to remotely control an infected computer.\n\n## Malware that chats on Telegram\n\nIn early 2021, dozens of users abandoned WhatsApp and switched to messaging apps that\npromised more data security after the company announced it would share users’ default\nmetadata with Facebook. Many of those users turned to rival apps Telegram and Signal.\nAccording to us, Telegram was the most downloaded app in January 2021, with over 63\nmillion installs. Telegram chats aren’t end-to-end encrypted like Signal chats, and now\nTelegram has another problem: malware.\n\nSoftware company Check Point recently discovered that malicious actors were using\nTelegram as a communication channel for a malware program called ToxicEye. It turns out\nthat attackers can use some features of Telegram to interact with their malware more easily\nthan through web-based tools. They can now mess with infected computers through a helpful\nTelegram chatbot.\n\n## What is ToxicEye and how does it work?\n\nToxicEye is a type of malware called a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). RATs can give an\nattacker remote control over an infected computer, which means that:\n\nsteal data from the host computer.\ndelete or transfer files.\nkill the processes running on the infected computer.\nhijack computer microphone and camera to record audio and video without user’s\nconsent or knowledge.\nencrypt files to extort money from users.\n\nToxicEye RAT is spread via a phishing scheme in which the targeted person receives an\nemail with an embedded EXE file. When the targeted user opens the file, the program\ninstalls the malware on their device. RATs are similar to remote access programs that, for\nexample, allow a technician to take control of your computer to fix a problem. But these\nprograms sneak around without permission. They can mimic or be hidden within legitimate\nfiles, often disguised as documents or embedded in a larger file, such as a video game.\n\n## The chain of infection\n\nThe attacker first creates a Telegram account, then a Telegram “bot”, which can\nperform actions remotely through the app.\nThis bot token is embedded in malicious source code.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malicious code is sent as spam, which is often disguised as something legitimate\nthat the user can click on.\nThe attached file is opened, installed on the host computer, and sends the information\nto the attacker’s command center via the Telegram bot.\n\n## Final remarks: How RAT Malware Is Using Telegram to Evade Detection\n\nI hope you understand this article, How RAT Malware Is Using Telegram to Evade Detection.\nIf your answer is no, you can ask anything via the contact forum section related to this article.\nAnd if your answer is yes, please share this article with your friends and family to give us\nyour support.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n-----",
