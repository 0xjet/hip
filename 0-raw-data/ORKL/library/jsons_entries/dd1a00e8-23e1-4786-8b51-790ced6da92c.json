By keeping track of their malware in spring 2021,\nwe were able to find a newer version. It contains the C++ Milum Trojan, a corresponding\nVBScript variant with the same version (1.6.1) and a set of modules that include an\norchestrator and three plugins. This confirms our previous assumption that there are more\nlast-stagers besides the C++ ones, based a field in the C2 communication protocol that\ncontains the “client” programming language.\n\nAnother language used by WildPressure is Python. The PyInstaller module for Windows\ncontains a script named “Guard”. Perhaps the most interesting finding here is that this\nmalware was developed for both Windows and macOS operating systems. The coding style,\noverall design and C2 communication protocol is quite recognizable across all three\nprogramming languages used by the authors.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe versioning system shows that the malware used by WildPressure is still under active\ndevelopment. Besides commercial VPS, this time the operators used compromised legitimate\nWordPress websites. With low confidence this time, we believe their targets to be in the oil\nand gas industry. If previously the operators used readable “clientids” like “HatLandid3”, the\nnew ones we observed in the Milum samples appear to be randomized like “5CU5EQLOSI”\nand “C29QoCli33jjxtb”.\n\nAlthough we couldn’t associate WildPressure’s activity with other threat actors, we did find\nminor similarities in the TTPs used by BlackShadow, which is also active in the same region.\nHowever, we consider that these similarities serve as minor ties and are not enough to make\nany attribution.\n\n**Python multi-OS Trojan**\n\n**SHA1** 872FC1D91E078F0A274CA604785117BEB261B870\n\n**File type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 (stripped to external PDB), for MS\nWindows\n\n**File size** 3.3 MB\n\n\n**File**\n**name**\n\n\nsvchost.exe\n\n\nThis PyInstaller Windows executable was detected in our telemetry on September 1, 2020,\nshowing version 2.2.1. It contains an archive with all the necessary libraries and a Python\nTrojan that works both on Windows and macOS. The original name of the script inside this\nPyInstaller bundle is “Guard”. The malware authors extensively relied on publicly available\nthird-party code[1] to create it. Near the entry point one can find the first operating systemdependent code, which checks on macOS if another instance of the Trojan is running.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_macOS-specific code snippet to check if another Trojan instance is already running_**\n\nThe Guard class constructor contains initial values, such as an XOR key (enc_key field) to\ndecrypt the configuration. In this sample, it is set to decimal 110 and the C2 message type\n(answer_type_value field) to “Check”. The code that initializes class members for encryption\nand network communications is OS independent, but persistence methods aren’t.\n\nFor macOS, Guard decodes an XML document and creates a plist file using its contents at\n$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.pyapple.plist to autorun itself; while for Windows,\nthe script creates a RunOnce registry key\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\gd_system. We provide the full list of\npersistence IoCs at the end of this article.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Malware decodes the XML, fills [pyscript] placeholder with its path and drops .plist file_**\n**_for persistence_**\n\nFor fingerprinting Windows and macOS operating systems, Guard uses standard Python\nlibraries. Beacon data for the C2 contains the hostname, machine architecture, OS release\nname. To fingerprint Windows targets, Guard also uses WQL (WMI Query Language)\nrequests similarly to Milum and WMIC command line utility features. For example, to\ndistinguish the installed security products it executes the following command:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\ncmd /c wmic /NAMESPACE:\\\\\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 PATH AntiVirusProduct GET\ndisplayName,\n\nproductUptoDate /Format:List\n\n\nOn macOS, Guard enumerates running processes using the “ls /Applications” command and\ncompares the results against a list of security solutions: [“kaspersky security.app”,”kaspersky\nanti-virus for mac.app”, “intego”, “sophos anti-virus.app”, “virusbarrier.app”,”mcafee internet\nsecurity.app”]\n\nThe path to the file containing Guard’s configuration data is\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\grconf.dat under Windows and $HOME\\.appdata\\grconf.dat under\nmacOS.\n\nGuard’s configuration data has to start with the string “*grds*”. Below is a comparison\nbetween different WildPressure sample parameters, including magic values used to pre- and\npost-fix the configuration data.\n\n**Parameter** **C++ Milum** **Python Guard** **VBScript Tandis**\n\n**Version** 1.0.1 – 1.6.1 2.2.1 1.6.1\n\n\n-----\n\n**Serial** Comparable to “clientid”\nwith values like\n“HatLandid3”\n\n**Relays** List of .php pages hosted\non VPS\n\n\n1——-C29QoCli\n————————\n\nList of hacked\nWordPress\nwebsites\n\n\n1——-Tandis_7\n————————\n\nList of hacked\nWordPress websites\n\n\n**Encoded**\n**configuration**\n**start\\end**\n\n\n(ws32) (we32) *grds* *grde* Configuration\nembedded inside\nthe script\n\n\nThese prefix and suffix values allowed us to decode Mulim and Guard configuration data as\nwell as the self-decrypted Tandis with Bash and Python scripts. Following configuration\nparsing, the Trojan is ready for its main working cycle. It awaits commands from its C2 that\nare XML-based and XOR-encrypted with the aforementioned decimal value 110. Among\nthem are typical Trojan functions: downloading files, uploading files, executing commands\nwith the OS command interpreter, updating the Trojan and cleaning up the target.\n\n**VBScript self-decrypted variant**\n\n**SHA1** CD7904E6D59142F209BD248D21242E3740999A0D\n\n**File type** Self-decrypting VBScript\n\n**File size** 51 KB\n\n**File name** l2dIIYKCQw.vbs\n\nWe named the Tandis Trojan after its “serial” configuration parameter. This VBScript Trojan\nversion is Windows-only and relies much more on WQL queries than Guard. It was first\ndetected in our telemetry on September 1, 2020, showing version 1.6.1. The abilities,\nparameters and working cycle are quite similar to Guard and other WildPressure malware.\n\nThe persistence is again system registry-based (please check the IoCs at the end). The\nfunction HexToBin() is in charge of the additional encryption used inside the script for some\nstrings and C2 communication. The basic unhexlify-XOR algorithm is the same as in the\ninitial self-decryption; and to read plain text we used the same aforementioned script with\ncorresponding key (again 110 decimal, stored in a class data member). The C2\ncommunication protocol is “encrypted XML over HTTP” (using Msxml2.XMLHTTP and\nMsxml2.DOMDocument objects).\n\nBelow are the commands that Tandis supports:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n1 Wait\n\n2 Silently execute command with interpreter with cmd /c\n\n3 Download file\n\n4 Update the script from server\n\n5 Clean up, remove persistence and the script file\n\n6 Upload file\n\n7 Update wait timings in the configuration\n\n8 Fingerprint the host. In particular, Tandis gathers all the installed security\nproducts besides Defender with a WQL query\n\n**Plugin-based C++ malware**\n\nIn addition to the already enumerated scripting implants that WildPressure uses, some\nfindings are related to C++ developments. We discovered several, previously unknown,\ninterconnected modules used to gather data on target hosts in our telemetry. The compilation\ntimes seen in this malware precedes our detection date by a large margin, and we therefore\nconsider them to be tampered with.\n\nThe plugins we found are rather simplistic. We will therefore focus on the implemented\ninterface between the orchestrator and its plugins.\n\n**Orchestrator**\n\n**SHA1** FA50AC04D601BB7961CAE4ED23BE370C985723D6\n\n**File type** PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**File size** 87 KB\n\n**File name** winloud.exe\n\nThis main module checks for the presence of a configuration file named “thumbnail.dat”. The\nprecise directory of this configuration file varies across Windows versions:\n\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\system\\thumbnail.dat\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application Data\\system\\Windows\\thumbnail.dat\n\nThe orchestrator uses a timer function that runs every two minutes and parses the\nconfiguration file for the plugin file path, function name, etc., and attempts to execute the\ncorresponding plugin.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The overall communication workflow between orchestrator and the plugins_**\n\nPlugins come in the form of a DLL that exports a function named accessPluginInterface(),\nwhich returns a pointer to a class object to the orchestrator. This main module then runs the\nsecond function from the virtual functions table, passing it the pointer to instantiated class\nobjects. The plugins we’ve seen so far contained RTTI information.\n\n**Fingerprinting plugin**\n\n**SHA1** c34545d89a0882bb16ea6837d7380f2c72be7209\n\n**File type** PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**File size** 194 KB\n\n**File name** GetClientInfo.dll\n\nThis plugin gathers really detailed data about the host with WQL queries and creates a JSON\nwith a publicly available library. The data includes OS version and the set of installed hotfixes,\nBIOS and HDD manufacturers, installed and running software and security products\nseparately, user accounts and network adapters settings, etc. The corresponding executed\nWQL queries look like this:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\nSELECT Domain, DomainRole, TotalPhysicalMemory, UserName, SystemType FROM\n\nWin32_ComputerSystem\n\nSELECT DHCPServer, DNSDomain, MACAddress, DHCPEnabled, DefaultIPGateway,\nIPAddress,\n\nIPSubnet FROM Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration WHERE IPEnabled ='TRUE'\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Keylogging and screenshotting plugins_**\n\n**SHA1** fb7f69834ca10fe31675bbedf9f858ec45c38239\n\n**File type** PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**File size** 90.5 KB\n\n**File name** Keylogger.dll\n\n**SHA1** 2bb6d37dbba52d79b896352c37763d540038eb25\n\n**File type** PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**File size** 78 KB\n\n**File name** ScreenShot.dll\n\nThese plugins are quite straightforward. The keylogger sets a WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook to\ngather the keystrokes and gets clipboard content and Windows titles. The second takes\nscreenshots by timer and by mouse events, setting a WH_MOUSE_LL hook.\n\n**Campaign infrastructure**\n\nThe actor used both VPS and compromised servers in their infrastructure, most of which\nwere WordPress websites. The legitimate, compromised websites served as Guard relay\nservers. In our previous 2019 investigation, we were able to sinkhole the Milum C2,\nupiserversys1212[.]com. During our current investigation we managed to sinkhole another\nMilum C2, mwieurgbd114kjuvtg[.]com. However, we haven’t registered any recent Milum\nrequests sent to these domains with the corresponding main.php or url.php URI.\n\n**Domain** **IP** **First seen** **ASN** **Malware**\n\nN/A 107.158.154[.]66 2021-04-07 62904, EONIX Milum\n\n185.177.59[.]234 2021-04-07 44901,\nBELCLOUD\n\n37.59.87[.]172 2014-12-26 16276, OVH\n\n80.255.3[.]86 2019-08-28 201011,\nNETZBETRIEB\n\n\nmwieurgbd114kjuvtg[.]com 139.59.250[.]183\n(Sinkholed)\n\nLegitimate, compromised Guard relay servers:\n\n\n2021-04-07\n(Sinkholed)\n\n\n14061,\nDIGITALOCEAN\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://adelice-formation[.]eu\nhxxp://ricktallis[.]com/news\nhxxp://whatismyserver123456[.]com\nhxxp://www.glisru[.]eu\nhxxp://www.mozh[.]org\n\n## Who was hit and by whom\n\nWe have very limited visibility for the samples described in this report. Based on our\ntelemetry, we suspect that the targets in the same Middle East region were related to the oil\nand gas industry.\n\nWe consider with high confidence that the aforementioned Tandis VBScript, PyInstaller and\nC++ samples belong to the same authors that we dubbed WildPressure due to the very\nsimilar coding style and victim profile. However, another question remains: is WildPressure\nconnected to other threat actors operating in the same region?\n\n[Among other actors that we’ve covered in the region Chafer and](https://securelist.com/chafer-used-remexi-malware/89538/) [Ferocious Kitten are worth](https://securelist.com/ferocious-kitten-6-years-of-covert-surveillance-in-iran/102806/)\nmentioning. Technically, there’s not much in common with their malware, but we observed\nsome minor similarities with another actor in the region we haven’t described publicly so far.\nMinor similarities with WildPressure are:\n\nThe “pk” parameter in HTTP requests to distinguish the Trojan beacons from, for\nexample, scanners;\nThe usage of hacked WordPress websites as relays.\n\nBoth tactics aren’t unique enough to come to any attribution conclusion – it’s possible both\ngroups are simply using the same generic techniques and programming approaches.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1v79QRhi1HM\n\nLearn [threat hunting and malware analysis with Denis Legezo and other GReAT experts.](https://xtraining.kaspersky.com/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=gl_xtr-generic-leaders_ay0073&utm_content=link&utm_term=gl_securelist_organic_tezngjogj73rli8&redef=1&THRU&reseller=gl_xtr-generic-leaders_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_post_______)\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Milum version 1.6.1**\n\n[0efd03fb65c3f92d9af87e4caf667f8e](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/0efd03fb65c3f92d9af87e4caf667f8e/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**PyInstaller with Guard**\n\n[92A11F0DCB973D1A58D45C995993D854 (svchost.exe)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/92A11F0DCB973D1A58D45C995993D854/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**Self-decrypting Tandis VBScript**\n\n[861655D8DCA82391530F9D406C31EEE1 (l2dIIYKCQw.vbs)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/861655D8DCA82391530F9D406C31EEE1/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**Orchestrator**\n\n[C116B3F75E12AD3555E762C7208F17B8 (winloud.exe)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/C116B3F75E12AD3555E762C7208F17B8/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**Plugins**\n\n[F2F6604EB9100F58E21C449AC4CC4249 (ScreenShot.dll)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/F2F6604EB9100F58E21C449AC4CC4249/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[D322FAA64F750380DE45F518CA77CA43 (Keylogger.dll)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/D322FAA64F750380DE45F518CA77CA43/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[9F8D77ECE0FF897FDFD8B00042F51A41 (GetClientInfo.dll)](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/9F8D77ECE0FF897FDFD8B00042F51A41/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**File paths**\n\n**macOS .plist files**\n\n$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.pyapple.plist\n\n$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/apple.scriptzxy.plist\n\n\n-----\n\n**Config files under Windows**\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\grconf.dat\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\vsdb.dat\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\system\\thumbnail.dat\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application Data\\system\\Windows\\thumbnail.dat\n\n**Config files under macOS**\n$HOME/.appdata/grconf.dat\n\n**Registry values**\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\gd_system\n\n**WQL queries examples**\nSELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name = ‘<all enumerated names here>’\nSelect * from Win32_ComputerSystem\nSelect * From AntiVirusProduct\nSelect * From Win32_Process Where ParentProcessId = ‘<all enumerated ids here>’\n\n**Milum C2**\nhxxp://107.158.154[.]66/core/main.php\nhxxp://185.177.59[.]234/core/main.php\nhxxp://37.59.87[.]172/page/view.php\nhxxp://80.255.3[.]86/page/view.php\nhxxp://www.mwieurgbd114kjuvtg[.]com/core/main.php\n\n[1] E.g.
