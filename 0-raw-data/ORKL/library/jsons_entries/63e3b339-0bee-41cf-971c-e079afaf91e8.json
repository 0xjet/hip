    "plain_text": "# The blurry boundaries between nation-state actors and the cybercrime underground\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/the-blurry-boundaries-between-nation-state-actors-and-the-cybercrime-underground](https://intel471.com/blog/the-blurry-boundaries-between-nation-state-actors-and-the-cybercrime-underground)**\n\nWhen it comes to attributing malicious cyber activity, there are two buckets by which actors\ngenerally fall in: “financially-motivated” or “nation-state.” The former is ultimately interested\nin money, while the latter is more concerned with obtaining or exploiting sensitive\ninformation to gain an advantage over a government or commercial entity. For the past\ndecade, defenders could generally discern whether attackers fit into each of the previously\nmentioned buckets by examining tools, infrastructure, techniques and/or processes. Now, as\ncybercriminal work becomes increasingly lucrative due to the amount of money or\ninformation that could be acquired, the border between those buckets is eroding. The lines\nbetween nation-state objectives and financially-motivated cybercrime have continued to blur\nas the relationship between profit and espionage has grown, particularly within the\ncybercrime underground.\n\nWhether nation-state threat actors were seen “moonlighting” in financially-motivated\ncybercrime or nation-states co-opted financially-motivated cybercriminals to do their\nbidding, Intel 471 has seen a slow and steady change in behavior where nation-states are\nincorporating the cybercrime underground to achieve their goals more than ever before.\n\n## An Opportunity Seized\n\nOne of the first instances of this behavior was formed in the heart of the cybercrime\nunderground: Russia. In 2014, the ZeuS trojan was one the most prolific pieces of malware,\ndescribed by security researchers as “smooth, effective and versatile” in its capabilities.\n\nDuring that year, law enforcement discovered a variant of ZeuS, known as GameOver, being\nleveraged to obtain credentials belonging to Georgian intelligence officers or leaders of elite\nTurkish police units in order to access classified Ukrainian secrets, material linked to the\nSyrian conflict, and information on Russian arms dealing. Over the course of an\ninvestigation, it appeared that the malware’s author, Yevgeniy Bogachev, was aware\nGameOver was being used as an intelligence tool, despite the fact that it was primarily used\nfor financial crime. Upon reflection of the operations, it’s likely that when Russian law\nenforcement had been monitoring Bogachev’s actions (the malware had been in use since\n2006) intelligence officers saw an opportunity to leverage GameOver for state objectives in\nexchange for looking the other way on ZeuS’s role in financial crimes. There are indications\nthat Russian security services were well aware of the significance of Bogachev and his ZeuS\n[malware around the time of Operation Trident Breach in 2010.](https://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/10/01/cyber.theft/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a similar turn of events, a prolific Iranian-linked actor who first surfaced in the cybercrime\nunderground in 2016 eventually carried out various actions that were linked in Iranian state\nactions. Operating under the handle bc.monster (though tied to several different monikers),\nthis actor was known for being sophisticated and highly experienced. The actor was likely\n[behind several major data breaches, including the compromise of the Citrix Systems](https://intel471.com/glossary/data-breach)\ncorporate network in late 2018.\n\nDespite making money on the cybercrime underground, Intel 471 discovered that a lot of\nbc.monster’s methods mimic those used by actors that have been linked to the Mabna\nInstitute, an Iranian-based organization that has ties to the country’s Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps. While Intel 471 did not find any evidence that directly linked bc.monster to the\nMabna Institute, we found a number of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that were\ncommon to the actor and the Mabna Institute. This included selling a Global Access List\n(GAL) from Exchange servers of various organisations, as well as the ability to perform\npassword spraying attacks against multi-factor authentication (MFA) implemented accounts.\nNotably, the alleged dates of compromise mentioned by the actor, such as Visa (Jan. 2018),\nthe National Bank of Canada (Feb. 2018), Saudi Aramco (Feb. 2018), were right before the\npublication of an FBI Flash Alert dated March 23, 2018 that detailed information on actors\ntied to the Mabna Institute.\n\nSince bc.monster’s work could be tied to both financial cybercrime and nation-state cyber\noperations, Intel 471 cannot rule out the possibility that the actor possibly worked for the\nIrainian government “by day” and engaged in financially motivated cybercrime after hours.\nHowever, despite the ties we’ve uncovered, that assessment remains uncorroborated at the\ntime for this report.\n\n## Room For Growth\n\nOver the past few years, the nation-states that are known to be aggressive actors have found\nways to co-opt the cybercrime underground into their efforts. What was first looked at as\nserendipity is now considered standard operating procedure. Nation-states now often look to\nthe know-how contained in the cybercrime underground as means to an end when it comes\nto their missions.\n\n### Iran\n\nBc.monster is only one example of Iran leaning on underground actors to carry out attacks.\nIn early 2020, Intel 471 observed the actor hidehacker, a vendor of compromised access and\ndata, specifically claiming to be based in Iran; working for the Iranian government as a\nmember of the APT34 hacking group. Also known as Helix, Helix Kitten, or OilRig, APT34\nlikely worked on behalf of Iranian state interests and specialized in cyber-espionage.\nEvidence that Hidehacker is a government-worker-by-day, criminal-actor-by-night came\nwhen he stated in a form that the Iranian government did not provide a satisfactory income,\n\n\n-----\n\nso the actor was going to sell some of the information obtained during his government-linked\nwork. Hidehacker also disclosed that most of the databases listed for sale were targets set by\nthe Iranian government.\n\nAdditionally, Intel 471 also suspects that drumrlu, a vendor of compromised data and\nunauthorized access to high-profile organizations, has also done work on behalf of the\nIranian government. In October 2020, we learned that drumrlu allegedly compromised and\ndeployed ransomware against several companies. Our research into those attacks revealed\nthat drumrlu’s TTPs matched other open-source research into the TTPs of Iran-based statesponsored group MuddyWater. While we cannot definitively say that drumrlu is associated\nwith MuddyWater, we have determined that it is likely.\n\n### China\n\nIn July 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice released an indictment that alleged two Chinese\nresidents hacked into the computer systems of hundreds of victim companies, governments,\nnon-governmental organizations, and individual dissidents, clergy, and democratic and\nhuman rights activists all over the world, including Hong Kong and China. The release stated\nLi Xiaoyu (李啸宇) and Dong Jiazhi (董家志) conducted a hacking campaign where the two\nacted for their own personal financial gain in some instances, while also working at the\ndirection of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) and other Chinese government agencies.\nUsing a host of tools, techniques, and procedures — including the well-known “China\nChopper” web shell program — The two stole information tied to technology designs,\nmanufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and chemical structures\nrelated to the pharmaceutical industry. After the indictment was announced, U.S. Assistant\nAttorney General John C. Demers declared that “China has now taken its place, alongside\nRussia, Iran and North Korea… providing a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for\nthose criminals being ‘on call’ to work for the benefit of the state.”\n\n### Russia\n\nOf course the country with the biggest share of the cybercrime underground is going to find a\nway to leverage it for its government’s objectives. Observers can examine the now-infamous\nSolarWinds hack to see the numerous ways Russian intelligence and the cybercrime\nunderground have worked side-by-side.\n\nComing to light in December 2020, the SolarWinds incident will likely be used for decades as\na prime example of the worst-case supply-chain-attack scenario. After months of speculation,\non April 15, 2021, the U.S. government formally claimed the Russian Foreign Intelligence\nService (SVR) was responsible for “the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited\nthe SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures.”\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile only coming to light in 2020, actors on the cybercrime underground have been\ntargeting SolarWinds for years prior to the discovered attack. Intel 471 observed an actor\nknown as Fxmsp in October 2017 claim to have gained access to some SolarWinds-controlled\nassets. By November 2017, Fxmsp stated the access was no longer available because they\nwere reserved for a “client.” Additionally, Fxmsp reportedly had issues with the SolarWinds\naccess, but claimed to be working to provide the client with what they were looking for. When\npressed for more details on the issues, Fxmsp revealed the actor allegedly was working\ntoward obtaining access to “the source codes and databases.”\n\nWhile there is no evidence of a connection between the 2017 actions and the SolarWinds\nhack, these two events show an overlap in targets of interest, as well as operational practices\nbetween sophisticated financially-motivated threat actors like Fxmsp and nation-state actors\nlike Russia’s SVR. On a deeper level, this exemplifies the level of access that a nation-state\nactor could obtain through the underground marketplace. Financially-motivated\ncybercriminals usually aim for the path of least resistance when it comes to making their\npersonal profit. This usually means working with already established, “plug-and-chug”\nproducts and services like ransomware, rather than getting into the complicated matter of\nsource code. Considering Fxmsp’s mention of a private “client” who allegedly appeared to be\ninterested in “source code,” the possibility that state-actors like those within or related to\nRussia’s SVR were the buyers of the SolarWinds access cannot be ruled out.\n\nAnother infamous, Russian-linked threat actor, Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets, was observed\nto be directly co-opted by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). Over time, Intel 471\ntracked Yakubets, operating under the handle “Aqua,” as the leader of the Russian hacking\n[group Evil Corp, which was involved with the Dridex malware and botnet. Yakubets also](https://intel471.com/glossary/botnet)\npurportedly supervised and managed the development, maintenance and distribution of, and\n[cashout activity related to Dridex. In 2019, Intel 471 reported (alongside other open source](https://intel471.com/glossary/cashout)\nreports) that Yakubets was actively collaborating with the FSB over a number of years. In\nApril 2021, the U.S. government announced sanctions against the government of the Russian\nFederation, citing “aggressive and harmful activities.” In a related press release from the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury, the U.S. claimed the FSB bolstered its cyber operations by coopting criminal hackers, “including the previously designated Evil Corp.” While Yakubets was\nnot specifically named in the press release, it’s likely that he was one of the many\ncybercriminals co-opted for Russian state objectives. As with Bogachev, there are strong\nindications that Russian security services were well aware of the significance of Yakubets and\nhis operations around the time of Operation Trident Breach in 2010.\n\n## A Blurry Reality\n\nThe majority of actors on the cybercriminal underground are heavily motivated by profit.\nThey come to the underground to make as much money as possible by illicit means.\nHowever, the notion that the underground is only an arena for financially-motivated\ncybercriminals is short-sighted. The instances discussed in this report, while far from\n\n\n-----\n\ndefinitive, show how the relationship between nation-states and the cybercriminal\nunderground have grown as each side embraced the benefits of utilizing cybercrime to carry\nout their goals. As more countries lean on computer network exploitation as a means to their\nown geopolitical objectives, the outreach to the cybercriminal underground suggests that the\nbuckets discussed in the beginning of the report may become one, murky mass where\nmotives become increasingly difficult to decipher.\n\n\n-----",
