It serves those_\n_looking to better understand, prepare for, and preempt an attack by Iranian operators against_\n_their personnel and organization and benefits Iran-focused analysts researching topics_\n_associated with Iranian social engineering to understand their typical targets, organizations,_\n_and objectives. Sources include the Recorded Future® Platform and industry reporting from_\n_Microsoft, Proofpoint, ClearSky, FireEye, Mandiant, and CitizenLab, among other open_\n_sources._\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nSince 2010, pro-Iranian government cyber intrusions have relied on social engineering as a\ncomponent of the cyberattack life cycle, whether executed through spearphishing attacks or\nmore directly through one-to-one engagements. Iranian operators have targeted members of\nforeign governments, militaries, businesses, and political dissidents. Their operations appear\nto use many of the studied “principles of influence” and overlap with human intelligence\n(HUMINT) recruitment practices, both of which influence social engineering methodologies.\nResearch on the Iranian government’s strategic and tactical approaches to the offensive and\ndefensive “Soft War” also suggests that social engineering is an indispensable element of the\ngovernment’s cyber capabilities, which it has relied on for at least a decade. Tehran views\nthe ability for a foreign power to incite domestic upheaval as being as dangerous as a\nmilitary attack on its territory. Equally so, the ability to foment social unrest internationally is a\ncapability at its disposal to attack its perceived enemies. Understanding and dissecting\nforeign societies, languages, cultures, and political systems has enabled Tehran to leverage\nsocial engineering in ways comparable to Russian threat activity groups.\n\nLarge-scale social engineering campaigns have predominantly been executed by APT35,\nTortoiseshell, and APT34, and their associated sub-groups. While their operations do not\ndiminish those run by other advanced persistent threat groups (APTs), these 3 Iran-nexus\ngroups have depicted substantial tradecraft overlaps in how they target their victims. These\ninclude the use of charismatic sock puppets, the lure of prospective job opportunities,\nsolicitation by journalists, and masquerading as think tank experts seeking opinions. These\nare just some of the personas which these 3 Iranian APTs have continued to use since the\nfirst major disclosure on Iranian social engineering — Operation Newscaster — was publicly\nreported in 2014.\n\n## Key Judgments\n\nThe use of social engineering is a central component of Iranian APT tradecraft when\nengaging in cyber espionage and information operations. Iranian APTs will continue to\nmodify their tradecraft, including phishing, spoofing, smishing, and other techniques to\ntarget their victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nMultiple Iranian threat activity groups use social engineering. APT35, APT34, and\nTortoiseshell remain among the earliest and most aggressive adopters of social\nengineering to aid their intrusion or credential theft operations. We expect these groups\nto continue to lead attacks using social engineering techniques in the future.\nPatterns in Iranian social engineering attacks suggest they aim to drive targets to\nmultiple platforms; this increases the attack surface by incorporating email, social\nmedia, and chat messengers as attack vectors. Malicious documents and applications\nwill continue to be disseminated via one-to-one sock puppet engagements with their\ntargets.\nVarious reported Iranian social engineering attacks share approaches, including\nrecruitment offers, offers to solicit targets for journalistic purposes or political analysis,\nromantic engagements, and supposed anti-government activism.\nThe use of foreign languages and knowledge of foreign societies and cultures will\ncontinue to play a central role in targeted social engineering attacks. Iranian APTs are\nimproving their command of major languages such as English and major European,\nMiddle Eastern, and South Asian languages.\n\n## Background\n\nThe growth of Iranian social engineering can be traced to Iranian hacker forums, with many\nincluding sub-threads on the techniques necessary to target unsuspecting victims. Some of\nthe earliest examples include the “Simorgh Security Team”, among the first to differentiate\nsocial engineering from other hacking disciplines. Members of that group claimed that a\nsocial engineer must be persuasive, articulate, and possess strong analytical and\nintelligence gathering skills.\nSocial engineering, a component of Iran’s defensive and offensive cyber capabilities\nembedded in pro-government Iranian cyber doctrine, can be traced to institutionalized\n[ideologies such as the “Soft War” (ﺟﻨﮓ ﻧﺮم). The concept of Soft War was](https://www.csis.org/analysis/united-states-soft-war-iran) [established as far](https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TM_008_44.pdf?x23987)\nback as 2010 and aims to counter subversion, or political, religious, economic, and cultural\nideals that may lead to the destabilization and fall of the Islamic Republic. These goals are\nlikely achieved by networks of trusted experts rooted deeply in Iran’s military and intelligence\norganizations.\n\nFor example, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Kerman\nprovince (Sarullah Corps) recognized the role of repatriating Iranian “elites” in countering\nenemy influence and disinformation campaigns, declaring them key in the struggle against\n“the disproportionate soft war and psychological operations [PSYOPS] of the enemy”. In this\ncontext, elites refer to highly educated Iranians close to the regime who have been directed\nto seek education and employment opportunities abroad.\n\nThe IRGC and its auxiliary force the Basij, as well as the Ministry of Intelligence and Security\n(MOIS), have cemented their role in the field to counter the Soft War since 2010; they have\nestablished multiple operational bases that, at least in name, are dedicated to the Soft War,\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch as the Baqiatallah al-Azam Social and Cultural Base (ﻗﺮارﮔﺎه ﺑﻘﯿﺔاﷲ اﻻﻋﻈﻢ). The Baqiatallah\nbase is currently headed by the former commander of the IRGC, General Mohammad Ali\nJafari, who on this matter claimed in November 2021 that the Islamic Republic’s enemies\naimed to destroy it and that “soft, cultural, and media wars” were harder to combat than a\nkinetic war.\n\nOpen source [analysis has referred to Tehran’s strategic threat perceptions within this space.](https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TM_008_44.pdf?x23987)\nAs early as 2010, Iran viewed social media platforms as “elements of a cyber warfare threat\n… particularly in the way rumors are spread online to ‘stir up’ discord within Iran”, following\nits own threats to the [establishment that arose from the 2009 Green Movement. Iran has](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-06-14/irans-green-movement-never-went-away)\nproven to strategically leverage the same threat calculus, along with the other Big Four\n(Russia, China, and to a lesser extent North Korea) adversarial nations, against its\nadversaries, including the US government.\n\nOperationally, Iranian social engineering depicts a strong emphasis on the use of foreign\nlanguages and cultures to execute defensive and offensive campaigns against domestic\nfoes, such as anti-revolutionary fronts like the Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MEK) and\nthe National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), and nations which Iran perceives to be its\nadversaries: the US, the UK, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. Pro-government operators understand\nadversarial societies and cultures well enough to mimic them; this capability manifests,\nwhether successful or not, in information operations, psyops, and cyber intrusions.\n\n**_[Editor’s Note: This post is an excerpt of a full report.
