In\naddition, the Guardia Civil said the suspects also had access to bank accounts storing\naround €3.5 million, which they had not yet moved and stolen from their respective owners.\n\n## A well-structured operation\n\nBoth the Mekotio and Grandoreiro malware strains are believed to be the work of Brazilian\ncybercrime groups who rent access to their tools to other gangs responsible for distributing\nthe trojan and laundering funds.\n\nBoth trojans are developed to target Windows computers and are usually spread using\nspoofed emails mimicking legitimate organizations. Once they infect a victim, they stay\nhidden and wait until users log into e-banking accounts, silently collecting their credentials.\n\nOfficials said the two trojans used in the attacks were capable of collecting data for up to 30\ndifferent banks. Once the attackers had access to victim bank accounts, they accessed ebanking portals and sent the funds to accounts under their control.\n\n“One characteristic in which all the victims agreed is that, once they carried out any banking\noperation through the web, their computers restarted several times until access was blocked,\nlater observing that large amounts of their money had been transferred to unknown\naccounts,” Guardia Civil officials said in a press release last week.\n\n“After that, the money was split by sending it to other accounts, or by withdrawing cash at\nATMs, transfers by BIZUM, REVOLUT cards, etc., in order to hinder possible police\ninvestigations,” the agency added. Officials did not say if the 16 suspects distributed the\nmalware, but said that they were heavily involved in helping launder the stolen funds.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe organization was perfectly structured and hierarchical, in 4 levels. On the one\nhand, there were those who were dedicated to receiving the amounts of fraudulent\ntransfers (Level 1), which they later transferred to other members of the organization\n(Level 2). On the other hand, there were those who transferred the money to other\naccounts located abroad (Level 3) and, finally, those who were dedicated to masking\nthe online operations of the accounts (Level 4).\n\n_[Guardia Civil](http://www.interior.gob.es/prensa/noticias/-/asset_publisher/GHU8Ap6ztgsg/content/id/13552853)_\n\n## Expansion of Brazil’s banking trojan ecosystem\n\nThe arrest of the 16 suspects in Spain confirm reports from security firms like ESET and\nKaspersky, both of whom warned last year that Brazilian cybercrime groups had been\nupdating their banking trojans with support for European banks, on top of their classic\nBrazilian and Latin American targets.\n\n[ESET, which has been tracking the evolution of both Mekotio and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/08/13/mekotio-these-arent-the-security-updates-youre-looking-for/) [Grandoreiro throughout](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/04/28/grandoreiro-how-engorged-can-exe-get/)\n2020, specifically highlighted how the two banking trojans grew in sophistication and reach\nlast year.\n\nWhile Mekotio is a relatively new operation, the Grandoreiro trojan has been around since\n2016 and is a well-known name in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nIn a July 2020 blog post, Kaspersky put both Mekotio (also known as Melcoz) and\n[Grandoreiro in the Tetrade, a codename the company was using to describe the four largest](https://securelist.com/the-tetrade-brazilian-banking-malware/97779/)\nbanking trojan families created, developed, and spread by Brazilian crooks on a global level.\nThe other two part of the Tetrade cartel were Guildma (Astaroth) and Javali.\n\n“Grandoreiro and Mekotio have been expanding to Europe (especially Spain) since around\nthe beginning of 2020, which attracted substantially more attention to these banking trojans\nthan before, whether it was from researchers, companies or police forces,” an ESET\nspokesperson told The Record earlier today.\n\n“The arrest demonstrates that the operation these threat actors are running is not a small\none. Additionally, it gives an estimate of how successful their European campaign was by\nrevealing how much money was stolen through Mekotio and Grandoreiro,” the security firm\nadded.\n\n[Stats released by Kaspersky today confirm both of Mekotio and Grandoreiro’s expansion to](https://securelist.com/arrests-of-members-of-tetrade-seed-groups-grandoreiro-and-melcoz/103366/)\nEurope, with Spain being the hardest hit after their native Brazil.\n\nThe Mekotio and Grandoreiro-related arrests in Spain are also the second time Spanish\nauthorities arrested local cybercriminals working with banking trojan malware in 2021. The\nfirst arrests took place in March when they apprehended four suspects for distributing the\nFluBot Android banking trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Article updated shortly after publication to clarify that the group was arrested mainly for_\n_money laundering activities and not malware distribution._ _Article also updated with ESET_\n_comments._\n\nTags\n\n[arrests](https://therecord.media/tag/arrests/)\n[banking trojan](https://therecord.media/tag/banking-trojan/)\n[Brazil](https://therecord.media/tag/brazil/)\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Grandoreiro](https://therecord.media/tag/grandoreiro/)\n[Law enforcement](https://therecord.media/tag/law-enforcement/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[Mekotio](https://therecord.media/tag/mekotio/)\n[Spain](https://therecord.media/tag/spain/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
