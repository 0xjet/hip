We have released our technical analysis in the form of a whitepaper.\n\n## Monsoon Targets Specific Victims\n\nThe overarching campaign appears to target both Chinese nationals within different\nindustries and government agencies in Southern Asia. It appears to have started in\nDecember 2015 and is still ongoing as of July 2016. The malware components used in\nMONSOON are typically distributed through weaponised documents sent through e-mail to\nspecifically chosen targets. Themes of these documents are usually political in nature and\ntaken from recent publications on topical current affairs.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Several Sophisticated Malware Components\n\nMONSOON includes the use of multiple malware families, including Unknown Logger Public,\nTINYTYPHON, BADNEWS, and an AutoIt backdoor. BADNEWS is particularly interesting,\ncontaining resilient command-and-control (C&C) capability using RSS feeds, Github, forums,\nblogs and Dynamic DNS hosts. Malware used in MONSOON contains the ability to bypass\nWindows User Account Control and evade modern anti-malware solutions.\n\n## Who Is Behind MONSOON?\n\nAmongst the evidence gathered during the MONSOON investigation were a number of\n[indicators which make it highly probable that this adversary and the Operation Hangover](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-05-20/hangover-report)\nadversary are one and the same and are operating out of the Indian Sub Continent.\n\n## How And When Did We Do The Research?\n\nOur investigation into MONSOON began in May 2016. Over the course of our investigation\nwe discovered over 170 malicious documents and 4 distinct malware families.\n\n## Download Links\n\nOur deep-dive technical analysis is available for download now\nfrom [https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/datasheets/monsoon-analysis-apt-campaign](https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/datasheets/monsoon-analysis-apt-campaign?utm_source=Labs&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=monsoon_whitepaper&utm_campaign=monsoon)\n\n### About Forcepoint\n\nForcepoint is the leading user and data protection cybersecurity company, entrusted to\nsafeguard organizations while driving digital transformation and growth.
