Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on\nthe dark underbelly of the internet.\n\n[See More →](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/cyber)\nKat Garcia is a cybersecurity researcher at Emsisoft, where, as part of her work, she tracks a\nransomware gang called Cl0p.\n\n\n-----\n\nYet, she was surprised when she got an email at the end of last month from the hackers. In\nthe message, the Cl0p hackers told her they had broken into the servers of a clothing shop\nfor expecting mothers and they had her phone, email, home address, credit card information,\nand Social Security number.\n\n\"We inform you that information about you and your purchases, as well as your payment\ndetails, will be published on the darknet if the company does not contact us,\" the hackers\nwrote. \"Call or write to this store and ask to protect your privacy.\"\n\nGarcia said that this incident \"shows how far threat actors are willing to go to monetize their\ncrimes.\"\n\n[The C10p cybercriminals are now trying to recruit customers of the breached companies to](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/ransom-gangs-emailing-victim-customers-for-leverage/)\nhelp them exhort the companies they hacked. It's the latest twist in the hacking group's\nattempts to extort money from victims, and it's one of the reasons that Cl0p has become one\nof the most interesting—and fearsome—hacking groups of early 2021.\n\n\"This is the first time I can recall a ransomware group using contact information of customers\nto reach out en masse through email,\" Brett Callow, a security researcher at Emsisoft, which\nspecializes in tracking ransomware, said in a phone call.\n\n\"In our team there is no me, there is only us, as a rule, most people are\ninterchangeable.\"\n\nSecurity researchers who have tracked Cl0p describe the group in blog posts and to\nMotherboard as a \"criminal enterprise\" that is \"ruthless,\" \"sophisticated and innovative,\"\n\"well-organized and well-structured,\" and \"very active—almost tireless.\"\n\n[The group's recent victims include: oil giant Shell, security company Qualys, U.S. bank](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252498363/Oil-giant-Shell-hit-through-Accellion-FTA-breach)\n[Flagstar, the controversial global law firm Jones Day,](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3an9vn/ransomware-gang-fully-doxes-bank-employees-in-extortion-attempt) [Stanford University, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-leaks-data-from-stanford-maryland-universities/) University of\nCalifornia, among several others, all victims of a supply chain hack against Accellion, a\ncompany that provides a file transfer application.\n\n[Cl0p, also known as TA505 and](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/eager-beaver-a-short-overview-of-the-restless-threat-actor-ta505-609546) [FIN11, has been around for at least three years, according](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/fin11-email-campaigns-precursor-for-ransomware-data-theft.html)\nto several security firms that have been tracking the group. But the hackers have recently\ngrabbed more headlines and become more prominent after gaining access to a treasure\ntrove of sensitive data from dozens of companies—and all thanks to one single hack.\n\nThe hackers are the benefactors—and, some think, the culprit—of the supply chain attack\nagainst the [Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA), a file-sharing service used by around](https://www.recordedfuture.com/dewmode-accellion-supply-chain-impact/)\n300 companies all over the world, according to Accellion. Security researchers still don't\nknow for sure whether Cl0p was the hacking group that compromised Accellion, or if they are\njust the ones that are monetizing the stolen data after the original hacking group gave them\naccess.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn an email conversation, Motherboard asked the hackers whether they were behind the\n[Accellion supply chain hack, and how they did it.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/d3y48v/what-is-a-supply-chain-attack)\n\n\"Yes. Somehow,\" the hackers responded.\n\n**Do you have knowledge of the inner workings of Cl0p or another ransomware**\n**gang? We’d love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you**\n**can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257**\n**1382, lorenzofb on Wickr, OTR chat at lorenzofb@jabber.ccc.de, or email**\n**[lorenzofb@vice.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:lorenzofb@vice.com)**\n\nCl0p published the name of the companies, and a sample of the stolen data, on its website,\nCL0P^_- LEAKS. As researchers from Talon, a division of South Korean cybersecurity\ncompany S2WLAB said in an email, \"some companies are found to be removed on the data\nleakage page on the dark web,\" presumably because they paid the ransom.\n\nThere are 52 companies on CL0P^_- LEAKS as of last week. These are presumably\ncompanies that have not paid the ransom requested by the hackers. Antonis Terefos, a\nresearcher at Fox-IT who has [studied the group, estimated that the group has hacked more](https://blog.fox-it.com/2020/11/16/ta505-a-brief-history-of-their-time/)\nthan 150 companies.\n\nA redacted screenshot of the website where Cl0p leaks some files to pressure companies\ninto paying a ransom to avoid further leaks. (Image: Motherboard)\n\nAs part of these breaches, Cl0p has posted victims' names, social security numbers, home\naddresses, financial documents, passport information, and other sensitive data on their\nwebsite, where they publicize their hacks in an attempt to show what data they have in their\nhands, and what they are capable of if the victim's don't pay up.\n\nAn Accellion spokesperson downplayed the extent of the hack, saying in an email that \"out of\napproximately 300 total FTA clients, fewer than 100 were victims of the attack. Within this\ngroup, fewer than 25 appear to have suffered significant data theft.\"\n\nCl0p normally contacts the breached companies directly via email, offering to negotiate a\npayment to avoid the leak of the stolen data on their chat portal. If the company agrees and\npays quickly, the hackers don't leak any data, nor put the company's name on their website.\nSometimes they even show a video as proof they deleted the sensitive data after a payment.\nIf the company refuses to engage, the hackers start leaking some data, according to multiple\nsecurity researchers who are tracking Cl0p.\n\n\"In the communications that they've had with victims that we've seen, they are relatively\nprofessional and respectful. So they do offer discounts,\" Kimberly Goody, the manager of the\nfinancial crime analysis team at FireEye, told Motherboard in a phone call.\n\nA screenshot of Cl0p chat portal. (Image: FireEye)\n\n\n-----\n\nIt seems that Cl0p knows that as long as they get a few big victims they can make good\nmoney.\n\nIn one case observed by FireEye at the end of 2020, the Cl0p hackers asked the victim for\n$20 million. After some negotiations, the victim company was able to get the price down to\n[$6 million. South Korean security firm S2WLAB said in January they saw a victim pay 220](https://twitter.com/S2WLAB/status/1346226971995475975)\nbitcoin, which appears to be the same case FireEye observed.\n\nIn another case, the hackers offered another victim a discount based on how quickly they\ncould reach an agreement: 30 percent discount if within three or four days, 20 percent if\nwithin 10 days, and 10 percent if it's within 20 days, according to Goody.\n\nThe hackers, however, have made some mistakes. To communicate with victims, Cl0p\nsometimes uses a custom chat portal that is not protected by a password. That makes the\nnegotiations visible to researchers and anyone who can guess the URL, according to Goody,\nwho said that that is how FireEye was able to observe some conversations between the\ngroup and its victims.\n\n[Unlike other ransomware groups such as Netwalker,](https://blog.knowbe4.com/new-ransomware-gang-pays-affiliates-up-to-70-of-the-loot) [REvil, and](https://intel471.com/blog/revil-ransomware-as-a-service-an-analysis-of-a-ransomware-affiliate-operation/) [CONTI, Cl0p doesn't run an](https://www.clearskysec.com/conti-ransomware/)\naffiliate program, meaning they don't share their malware with other cybercriminals to get a\nshare of their proceedings. Cl0p appears to run the whole hacking operation from start to\nfinish, which reduces the size of their earnings, according to Goody.\n\n\"They're content with the slow and steady pace. I mean, it's not like they aren't able to make\na lot of money potentially, from these compromises, given that they are demanding millions\nof dollars when they are successful,\" Goody said. \"They're not necessarily greedy, like\nmaybe some of these other actors are.\"\n\nA screenshot of Cl0p communicating with a victim on the group's chat portal. (Image:\nFireEye)\n\n\"It is indecent to ask strangers about how much they earn,\" the hackers said.\n\nThe hackers also declined to say much about themselves.\n\n\"In our team there is no me, there is only us, as a rule, most people are interchangeable.\"\nthey wrote in the email interview. \"There are several people in the team and we have existed\nfor several years.\"\n\nWhile the hackers' identities are unknown, security researchers agree that the group is likely\nbased in a country part of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which is formed\nby Russia and former Soviet Union countries.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before they make a mistake which will help [law enforcement\nto identify its members.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nGoody said that Cl0p s ransomware has metadata in Russian language, and the hackers\nappear to stop their activities during Russian holidays. Moreover, she added, their malware is\nprogrammed to check if the infected computers use the Russian language character set, or\nkeyboard layouts for countries in the CIS. If that's the case, the ransomware deletes itself.\n\nThis is a true and tested strategy to avoid attracting the attention of authorities in Russia or\nother Eastern European countries, which are sometimes believed to tolerate cybercrime as\nlong as it doesn't impact their own citizens. Despite these precautions, some believe Cl0p is\ngetting a bit too popular for its own good.\n\n\"They are getting too much attention, not a good thing. Last year, nobody was interested in\nthem. Now, there are many reports writing about them and [law enforcement] cases\nongoing,\" a security researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not\nauthorized to speak to the press, told Motherboard in an email. \"Maybe they'll rebrand like\nother ransomware gangs did to get out of the focus. Maybe they continue to operate\nbecause they reside in a safe haven like a [Commonwealth of Independent States] country.\nHopefully, their doors get kicked in one morning…\"\n\nTerefos agreed.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before they make a mistake which will help [law enforcement to\nidentify its members,\" he said.\n\n**_Subscribe to our cybersecurity podcast,_** **_[CYBER.](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2)_**\n\n## ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
