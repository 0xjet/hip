However, entities worldwide can\nmitigate the vulnerabilities listed in this report by applying the available patches to their systems and\nimplementing a centralized patch management system.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-209A_Joint_CSA%20Top%20Routinely%20Exploited%20Vulnerabilities.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n Key Findings\n\nIn 2020, cyber actors readily exploited recently disclosed vulnerabilities to compromise unpatched systems.\nBased on available data to the U.S. Government, a majority of the top vulnerabilities targeted in 2020 were\ndisclosed during the past two years. Cyber actor exploitation of more recently disclosed software flaws in 2020\nprobably stems, in part, from the expansion of remote work options amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid\nshift and increased use of remote work options, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and cloud-based\nenvironments, likely placed additional burden on cyber defenders struggling to maintain and keep pace with\nroutine software patching.\n\n**Four of the most targeted vulnerabilities in 2020 affected remote work, VPNs, or cloud-based**\n**technologies. Many VPN gateway devices remained unpatched during 2020, with the growth of remote work**\noptions challenging the ability of organizations to conduct rigorous patch management.\n\nCISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI consider the vulnerabilities listed in table 1 to be the topmost regularly\nexploited CVEs by cyber actors during 2020.\n\n_Table 1:Top Routinely Exploited CVEs in 2020_\n\n**Vendor** **CVE** **Type**\n\nCitrix CVE-2019-19781 arbitrary code execution\n\nPulse CVE 2019-11510 arbitrary file reading\n\nFortinet CVE 2018-13379 path traversal\n\n\n-----\n\n**Vendor** **CVE** **Type**\n\nF5- Big IP CVE 2020-5902 remote code execution (RCE)\n\nMobileIron CVE 2020-15505 RCE\n\nMicrosoft CVE-2017-11882 RCE\n\nAtlassian CVE-2019-11580 RCE\n\nDrupal CVE-2018-7600 RCE\n\nTelerik CVE 2019-18935 RCE\n\nMicrosoft CVE-2019-0604 RCE\n\nMicrosoft CVE-2020-0787 elevation of privilege\n\nMicrosoft CVE-2020-1472 elevation of privilege\n\nIn 2021, malicious cyber actors continued to target vulnerabilities in perimeter-type devices. Among those\nhighly exploited in 2021 are vulnerabilities in Microsoft, Pulse, Accellion, VMware, and Fortinet.\n\nCISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI assess that public and private organizations worldwide remain vulnerable to\ncompromise from the exploitation of these CVEs. Malicious cyber actors will most likely continue to use older\nknown vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-11882 affecting Microsoft Office, as long as they remain effective\nand systems remain unpatched. Adversaries’ use of known vulnerabilities complicates attribution, reduces\ncosts, and minimizes risk because they are not investing in developing a zero-day exploit for their exclusive\nuse, which they risk losing if it becomes known.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to remediate or mitigate vulnerabilities as quickly as possible to reduce the risk\nof exploitation. Most can be remediated by patching and updating systems. Organizations that have not\nremediated these vulnerabilities should investigate for the presence of IOCs and, if compromised, initiate\nincident response and recovery plans. See the Contact Information section below for how to reach CISA to\nreport an incident or request technical assistance.\n\n## 2020 CVEs\n\nCISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and FBI have identified the following as the topmost exploited vulnerabilities by\nmalicious cyber actors from 2020: CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-5902,\nCVE-2020-15505, CVE-2020-0688, CVE-2019-3396, CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2019-11580, CVE-2018-7600,\n[CVE 2019-18935, CVE-2019-0604, CVE-2020-0787, CVE-2020-1472.[1][2][3] Among these vulnerabilities,](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/15/2002621240/-1/-1/0/CSA_SVR_TARGETS_US_ALLIES_UOO13234021.PDF)\nCVE-2019-19781 was the most exploited flaw in 2020, according to U.S. Government technical analysis.CVE2019-19781 is a recently disclosed critical vulnerability in Citrix’s Application Delivery Controller (ADC)—a\nload balancing application for web, application, and database servers widely use throughout the United\n\n\n-----\n\n[States.[4][5] Nation-state and criminal cyber actors most likely favor using this vulnerability because it is easy](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/advisories/2020-001-4-remediation-critical-vulnerability-citrix-application-delivery-controller-and-citrix-gateway)\nto exploit, Citrix servers are widespread, and exploitation enables the actors to perform unauthorized RCE on\n[a target system.[6]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a)\n\n[Identified as emerging targets in early 2020,[7] unremediated instances of CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2019-](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-133a)\n11510 continued to be exploited throughout the year by nation-state advanced persistent threat actors (APTs)\n[who leveraged these and other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2018-13379[8][9], in VPN services[10][11] to](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/alerts/apt-exploitation-fortinet-vulnerabilities)\n[compromise an array of organizations, including those involved in COVID-19 vaccine development.[12][13]](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/16/2002457639/-1/-1/0/NCSC_APT29_ADVISORY-QUAD-OFFICIAL-20200709-1810.PDF)\n\nThe CVE-2019-11510 vulnerability in Pulse Connect Secure VPN was also frequently targeted by nation-state\nAPTs. Actors can exploit the vulnerability to steal the unencrypted credentials for all users on a compromised\nPulse VPN server and retain unauthorized credentials for all users on a compromised Pulse VPN server and\ncan retain unauthorize access after the system is patched unless all compromised credentials are changed.\n[Nation-state APTs also commonly exploited CVE-2020-15505 and CVE-2020-5902.[14][15][16][17]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-010a)\n\n## 2021 CVEs\n\nIn 2021, cyber actors continued to target vulnerabilities in perimeter-type devices. In addition to the 2020\nCVEs listed above, organizations should prioritize patching for the following CVEs known to be exploited.\n\n**Microsoft Exchange: CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065**\n\nSee CISA’s Alert: Mitigate Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities for more information on\nidentifying and mitigating malicious activity concerning these vulnerabilities.\n**Pulse Secure: CVE-2021-22893, CVE-2021-22894, CVE-2021-22899, and CVE-2021-22900**\n\nSee CISA’s Alert: Exploitation of Pulse Connect Secure Vulnerabilities for more information on how\nto investigate and mitigate this malicious activity.\n**Accellion: CVE-2021-27101, CVE-2021-27102, CVE-2021-27103, CVE-2021-27104**\n\nSee the Australia-New Zealand-Singapore-UK-U.S. Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: Exploitation of\nAccellion File Transfer Appliance for technical details and mitigations.\n**VMware: CVE-2021-21985**\n\nSee CISA’s Current Activity: Unpatched VMware vCenter Software for more information and\nguidance.\n**Fortinet: CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and CVE-2019-5591**\n\nSee the CISA-FBI Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: APT Actors Exploit Vulnerabilities to Gain Initial\nAccess for Future Attacks for more details and mitigations.\n\n## Mitigations and Indicators of Compromise\n\nOne of the most effective best practices to mitigate many vulnerabilities is to update software versions once\npatches are available and as soon as is practicable. If this is not possible, consider applying temporary\nworkarounds or other mitigations, if provided by the vendor. If an organization is unable to update all software\nshortly after a patch is released, prioritize implementing patches for CVEs that are already known to be\nexploited or that would be accessible to the largest number of potential attackers (such as internet-facing\nsystems). This advisory highlights vulnerabilities that should be considered as part of the prioritization\nprocess. To further assist remediation, automatic software updates should be enabled whenever possible.\n\nFocusing scarce cyber defense resources on patching those vulnerabilities that cyber actors most often use\noffers the potential of bolstering network security while impeding our adversaries’ operations. For example,\nnation-state APTs in 2020 extensively relied on a single RCE vulnerability discovered in the Atlassian Crow, a\ncentralized identity management and application (CVE-2019-11580) in its reported operations. A concerted\nfocus on patching this vulnerability could have a relative broad impact by forcing the actors to find alternatives,\nwhich may not have the same broad applicability to their target set.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, attackers commonly exploit weak authentication processes, particularly in external-facing\ndevices. Organizations should require multi-factor authentication to remotely access networks from external\nsources, especially for administrator or privileged accounts.\n\nTables 2–14 provide more details about, and specific mitigations for, each of the top exploited CVEs in 2020.\n\n**Note: The lists of associated malware corresponding to each CVE below are not meant to be exhaustive but**\nintended to identify a malware family commonly associated with exploiting the CVE.\n\n_Table 2: CVE-2019-19781 Vulnerability Details_\n\n**Citrix Netscaler Directory Traversal (CVE-2019-19781)**\n\n\n**Vulnerability Description**\nCitrix Netscaler Application Delivery Control (ADC) is vulnerable to RCE and full system\ncompromise due to poor access controls, thus allowing directory traversal.\n\n**Vulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns**\n\nThe lack of adequate access controls allows an attacker to enumerate system directories for\nvulnerable code (directory traversal). In this instance, Citrix ADC maintains a vulnerable Perl\nscript ( newbm.pl ) that, when accessed via `HTTP POST request ( POST`\n```\nhttps://$TARGET/vpn/../vpn/portal/scripts/newbm.pl ), allows local operating system\n\n```\n(OS) commands to execute. Attackers can use this functionality to upload/execute command\nand control (C2) software (webshell or reverse-shell executable) using embedded commands\n(e.g., curl, `wget,` `Invoke-WebRequest ) and gain unauthorized access to the OS.`\n\n_Multiple malware campaigns, including NOTROBIN, have taken advantage of this vulnerability._\n\n**Recommended Mitigations**\n\nImplement the appropriate refresh build according to the vulnerability details outlined by\nthe vendor: Citrix: Mitigation Steps for CVE-2019-19781\nIf possible, only allow the VPN to communicate with known Internet Protocol (IP)\naddresses (allow-list).\n\n**Detection Methods**\n\nCISA has developed a free detection tool for this vulnerability: cisagov/check-cve-201919781: Test a host for susceptibility to CVE-2019-19781.\nNmap developed a script that can be used with the port scanning engine: CVE-201919781 - Citrix ADC Path Traversal #1893.\nCitrix also developed a free tool for detecting compromises of Citrix ADC Appliances\n[related to CVE-2019-19781: Citrix / CVE-2019-19781: IOC Scanner for CVE-2019-19781.](https://github.com/citrix/ioc-scanner-CVE-2019-19781)\nCVE-2019-19781 is commonly exploited to install web shell malware.

Cyber actors most\nlikely continue to exploit this vulnerability because Microsoft Office use is ubiquitous worldwide,\nthe vulnerability is ideal for phasing campaigns, and it enables RCE on vulnerable systems.\n\n\n**CVSS**\n**3.0**\n\nHigh\n\n\n-----\n\n**Vulnerability Discussion, IOCs, and Malware Campaigns**\n\nMicrosoft Equation Editor, a component of Microsoft Office, contains a stack buffer overflow\nvulnerability that enables RCE on a vulnerable system. The component was compiled on\nNovember 9, 2000. Without any further recompilation, it was used in all currently supported\nversions of Microsoft Office. Microsoft Equation Editor is an out-of-process COM server that is\nhosted by `eqnedt32.exe, meaning it runs as its own process and can accept commands from`\nother processes.\n\nData execution prevention (DEP) and address space layout randomization (ASLR) should\nprotect against such attacks. However, because of the manner in which `eqnedt32.exe was`\nlinked, it will not use these features, subsequently allowing code execution. Being an out-ofprocess COM server, protections specific to Microsoft Office such as EMET and Windows\nDefender Exploit Guard are not applicable to `eqnedt32.exe, unless applied system-wide. This`\nprovides the attacker with an avenue to lure targets into opening specially crafted documents,\nresulting in the ability to execute an embedded attacker commands.\n\n_Multiple cyber espionage campaigns have taken advantage of this vulnerability.
