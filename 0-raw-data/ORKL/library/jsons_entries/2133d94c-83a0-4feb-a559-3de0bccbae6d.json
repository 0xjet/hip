Naikon was mentioned\n\nbecause of its role in what turned out to be a unique and\n\nsurprising story about payback. It was a Naikon attack on a\n\nHellsing-related organization that first introduced us to the\n\nHellsing APT.

The attackers appeared to be\n\nChinese-speaking and targeted mainly top-level government\n\nagencies and civil and military organizations in countries such as\n\nthe Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam,\n\nMyanmar, Singapore, Nepal, Thailand, Laos and China.\n\n\n-----\n\n## DecoyDecoy\n\nAn attack typically starts with an email carrying an attachment that\n\ncontains information of interest to the potential victim. The\n\ndocument may be based on information from open sources or on\n\nproprietary information stolen from other compromised systems.\n\nThis bait “document”, or email attachment, appears to be a\n\nstandard Word document, but is in fact an CVE-2012-0158\n\nexploit, an executable with a double extension, or an executable\n\nwith an RTLO filename, so it can execute code without the user’s\n\nknowledge or consent. When the executable is launched,\n\nspyware is installed on the victim computer at the same time as a\n\ndecoy document is displayed to the user; fooling them into\n\nthinking they have simply opened a document.\n\n## ConfigurationConfiguration\n\n\n-----\n\n, y, g j\n\ninto the browser along with configuration data. With the help of a\n\nstart-up module, this whole file is injected into the browser\n\nmemory and decrypts the configuration block containing the\n\nfollowing:\n\nC&C server\n\nPorts and path to the server\n\nUser-agent string\n\nFilenames and paths to its components\n\nHash sums of the user API functions\n\nThe same code then downloads its main body from the C&C\n\nserver using the SSL protocol, loads it independently from the\n\noperating system functions and, without saving it to the hard\n\ndrive, hands over control to the XS02 function. All functionality is\n\nhandled in memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main module is a remote administration utility. Using SSL, the\n\nmodule establishes a reverse connection to the C&C server as\n\nfollows: it sets up an outgoing connection to the C&C server and\n\nchecks if there is a command that it should execute. If there is, it\n\nexecutes the command and returns the result to the C&C. There\n\nare 48 commands in the module’s repertoire, which a remote\n\noperator can use to effectively control the victim computer. This\n\nincludes taking a complete inventory, downloading and uploading\n\ndata, installing add-on modules, or working with the command\n\nline.\n\n##### The main module supports 48\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fanalysis%2Fpublications%2F69953%2Fthe-naikon-apt%2F&text=The+main+module+supports+48+commands%2C+which+the+attackers+can+use+to+control+the+victim+machine+%23NaikonAPT) commands, which the\n\n##### attackers can use to control the victim machine #NaikonAPT\n\nHere is the complete list of commands:\n\n0 CMD_MAIN_INFO\n\n1 CMD_PROCESS_REFRESH\n\n2 CMD_PROCESS_NAME\n\n3 CMD_PROCESS_KILL\n\n4 CMD_PROCESS_MODULE\n\n5 CMD_DRIVE_REFRESH\n\n6 CMD_DIRECTORY\n\n7 CMD_DIRECTORY_CREATE\n\n8 CMD_DIRECTORY_CREATE_HIDDEN\n\n9 CMD_DIRECTORY_DELETE\n\n10 CMD_DIRECTORY_RENAME\n\n11 CMD_DIRECOTRY_DOWNLOAD\n\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fanalysis%2Fpublications%2F69953%2Fthe-naikon-apt%2F&text=The+main+module+supports+48+commands%2C+which+the+attackers+can+use+to+control+the+victim+machine+%23NaikonAPT)\n\n\n-----\n\n13 CMD_FILE_DELETE\n\n14 CMD_FILE_RENAME\n\n15 CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_NORMAL\n\n16 CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_HIDDEN\n\n17 CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_NORMAL_CMD\n\n18 CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_HIDDEN_CMD\n\n19 CMD_FILE_UPLOAD\n\n20 CMD_FILE_DOWNLOAD\n\n21 CMD_WINDOWS_INFO\n\n22 CMD_WINDOWS_MESSAGE\n\n23 CMD_SHELL_OPEN\n\n24 CMD_SHELL_CLOSE\n\n25 CMD_SHELL_WRITE\n\n26 CMD_SERVICE_REFRESH\n\n27 CMD_SERVICE_CONTROL\n\n28 CMD_PROGRAM_INFO\n\n29 CMD_UNINSTALL_PROGRAM\n\n30 CMD_REGESTRY_INFO\n\n31 CMD_ADD_AUTO_START\n\n32 CMD_MY_PLUGIN\n\n33 CMD_3RD_PLUGIN\n\n34 CMD_REG_CREATEKEY\n\n35 CMD_REG_DELETEKEY\n\n36 CMD_REG_SETVALUE\n\n37 CMD_REG_DELETEVALUE\n\n38 CMD_SELF_KILL\n\n39 CMD_SELF_RESTART\n\n40 CMD_SELF_CONFIG\n\n41 CMD_SELF_UPDATE\n\n42 CMD_SERVER_INFO\n\n43 CMD_INSTALL_SERVICE\n\n44 CMD_FILE_DOWNLOAD2\n\n45 CMD RESET\n\n\n-----\n\n50 CMD_HEART_BEAT\n\nSeveral modifications of the main module exist.

It can be used\n\nto manage an entire network of infected clients. In some cases, a\n\nproxy is used to tunnel victim traffic to the XSControl server. A\n\nNaikon proxy server is a dedicated server that accepts incoming\n\nconnections from victim computers and redirects them to the\n\noperator’s C&C. An individual Naikon proxy server can be set up\n\nin any target country with traffic tunnelling from victim systems to\n\nthe related C&C servers.\n\nXSControl is written in .NET with the use of DevExpress:\n\n\n-----\n\nIts main capabilities are:\n\nAccept initial connections from clients\n\nProvide clients with the main remote administration module\n\nEnable them to remotely administer infected computers with\n\nthe help of a GUI\n\nKeep logs of client activity\n\nKeep logs of operator activity\n\nUpload logs and files to an FTP server\n\nThe operator’s activity logs contain the following:\n\nAn XML database of downloaded files, specifying the time of\n\noperation, the remote path and the local path\n\nA database of file names, the victim computer registry keys for\n\nthe folders and requested sections\n\nA history of executed commands\n\n## Country X, Operator XCountry X, Operator X\n\n\n-----\n\ny\n\nAnalysis revealed that the cyber-espionage campaign against\n\ncountry X had been going on for many years. Computers infected\n\nwith the remote control modules provided attackers with access to\n\nemployees’ corporate email and internal resources, and access to\n\npersonal and corporate email content hosted on external services.\n\nBelow is a partial list of organizations affected by Naikon’s\n\n“operator X’s” espionage campaign in country X.\n\nOffice of the President\n\nMilitary Forces\n\nOffice of the Cabinet Secretary\n\nNational Security Council\n\nOffice of the Solicitor General\n\nIntelligence Services\n\nCivil Aviation Authority\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nFederal Police\n\nExecutive/Presidential Administration and Management Staff\n\nA few of these organizations were key targets and under\n\ncontinuous, real-time monitoring. It was during operator X’s\n\nnetwork monitoring that the attackers placed Naikon proxies\n\nwithin the countries’ borders, to cloak and support real-time\n\noutbound connections and data exfiltration from high-profile victim\n\norganizations.\n\nIn order to obtain employees’ credentials, operator X sometimes\n\nused keyloggers. If necessary, operator X delivered them via the\n\nremote control client. In addition to stealing keystrokes, this\n\nattacker also intercepted network traffic. Lateral movements\n\nincluded copying over and remotely setting up winpcap across\n\ndesktop systems within sensitive office networks, then remotely\n\nsetting up AT jobs to run these network sniffers. Some APTs like\n\nNaikon distribute tools such as these across multiple systems in\n\norder to regain control if it is lost accidentally and to maintain\n\npersistence.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### group took advantage of cultural idiosyncrasies in its target countries\n\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fanalysis%2Fpublications%2F69953%2Fthe-naikon-apt%2F&text=The+%23NaikonAPT+group+took+advantage+of+cultural+idiosyncrasies+in+its+target+countries)\n\n\nOperator X also took advantage of cultural idiosyncrasies in its\n\ntarget countries, for example, the regular and widely accepted use\n\nof personal Gmail accounts for work. So it was not difficult for the\n\nNaikon APT to register similar-looking email addresses and to\n\nspear-phish targets with attachments, links to sites serving\n\nmalware, and links to google drive.\n\n## The empire strikes backThe empire strikes back\n\nEvery once in a while the Naikon group clashes with other APT\n\ngroups that are also active in the region. In particular, we noticed\n\nthat the Naikon group was spear-phished by an actor we now call\n\n“Hellsing”.
