The outcome/results of the blacklist check are then printed to the console.\n\n Version 1 SHA1: 848b903a0f67f8fd71152b2b73a010fba547038c\n\n Version 2 SHA1: d4910eaf5620528905b371c9a91fa5e3467978be\n\n Version 3 SHA1: 37dc0e94a06257e91b041341f08dc435fe69d772\n\n## Example - when running on a system monitored by SentinelOne\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\infected\\Desktop>S1_SUNBURST_Assessment.exe\nSentinelLabs SUNBURST Assessment Tool Version 2\nDescription: This tool checks the current system for processes, services, and drivers\nthat SUNBURST attempts to identify in its blacklist, prints the match, as well as the\noutcome.\n[+] Checking running processes/services...\n[+] Done checking running processes/services!\n[+] Checking loaded drivers...\nDRIVERS BLACKLIST MATCH: Loaded driver SentinelMonitor.sys matches hardcoded\nblacklist hash 12343334044036541897\nOUTCOME: SUNBURST will exit!\n[+] Done checking loaded drivers!\n\n## Example - when running on a malware analyst machine\nC:\\Users\\REM\\Desktop>S1_SUNBURST_Assessment.exe\nSentinelLabs SUNBURST Assessment Tool Version 2\nDescription: This tool checks the current system for processes, services, and drivers\nthat SUNBURST attempts to identify in its blacklist, prints the match, as well as the\noutcome.\n[+] Checking running processes/services...\nBLACKLIST MATCH: Running process pestudio matches hardcoded blacklist hash\n10235971842993272939\nOUTCOME: SUNBURST will exit!\nBLACKLIST MATCH: Running process dnSpy matches hardcoded blacklist hash\n13825071784440082496\nOUTCOME: SUNBURST will exit!\n[+] Done checking running processes/services!\n[+] Checking loaded drivers...\n[+] Done checking loaded drivers!\n\n```\n\n-----",
