This report includes details related to the major\nhacking targets of the SectorJ04 group in 2019, how those targets were hacked, characteristics of\ntheir hacking activities this year and recent cases of the SectorJ04 group’s hacking.\n\n## SectorJ04 group activity range and hacking methods\n\nThe SectorJ04 group has maintained the scope of its existing hacking activities while expanding\nits hacking activities to companies in various industrial sectors located in East Asia and Southeast\nAsia. There was a significant increase in their hacking activities in 2019, especially those\ntargeting South Korea. They mainly utilize spam email to deliver their backdoor to the infected\nsystem that can perform additional commands from the attacker’s server.\n\n### Main countries and sectors targeted\n\nThe SectorJ04 group’s preexisting targets were financial institutions located in countries such as\nNorth America and Europe, or general companies such as retail and manufacturing, but they\nrecently expanded their areas of activity to include the medical, pharmaceutical, media, energy\nand manufacturing industries. They do not appear to place much restrictions on the sectors\ntargeted. The following are the sectors and countries under which SectorJ04 group was found in\n2019.\n\nFigure 1 SectorJ04 group’s first half activity timeline in 2019\n\n**Targeted Countries**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe saw SectorJ04 group activity in Germany, Indonesia, the United States, Taiwan, India,\nFrance, Serbia, Ecuador, Argentina, South Korea, Japan, China, Britain, South Africa, Italy, Hong\nKong, Romania, Ukraine, Macedonia, Russia, Switzerland, Senegal, the Philippines, UAE, Qatar,\nSaudi Arabia, Pakistan, Thailand, Bahrain, Turkey, Bulgaria, Bangladesh\n\nFigure 2 SectorJ04 group targeted countries\n\n**Targeted Industries**\n\nFinancial-related corporate and government departments such as banks and exchanges\nRetail business such as shopping malls and social commerce\nEducational institutions such as a universities\nManufacturing companies such as manufactures of electronic products\nMedia companies such as broadcasting and media\nPharmaceutical and biotechnology-related companies\nA job-seeking company\nEnergy-related companies such as urban gas and wind power generation\n\n### Hacking Techniques\n\nThe SectorJ04 group mainly utilizes a spear phishing email with MS Word or Excel files attached,\nand the document files downloads the Microsoft Installer (MSI) installation file from the attacker\nserver and uses it to install backdoor on the infected system. As anti-virus programs have\nrecently begun to detect MSI files, in some instances macro scripts contained in the malicious\ndocuments would install backdoors directly onto infected systems without using MSI files.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 Schematic drawing for SectorJ04 group’s hacking method\n\nMalicious documents used for hacking are mainly written as themes related to MS Office, and the\nsame themes are often used several times, with only language changes depending on the\nvictim’s language.\n\nIn addition, the MSI files backdoor used by SectorJ04 mostly had valid digital signatures, and\nmost of their malware were signed just days before they were found.\n\nFigure 4 Part of the malicious document execution screen that the SectorJ04 group attaches to\nthe spear phishing email\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 Part of the digital signature found in the executable used for hacking\n\n**Digital signature information found in malware**\n\nVAL TRADEMARK TWO LIMITED\nALLO LTD\nCOME AWAY FILMS LTD\nAWAY PARTNERS LIMITED\nANG APPCONN LIMITED\nSTART ARCHITECTURE LTD\nSLON LTD\nDIGITAL DR\nFIT AND FLEX LIMITED\nDream Body Limited\nBOOK A TEACHER LTD\nMARK A EVANS LTD\nWAL GRAY LTD\nMISHA LONDON LTD\nSTART ARCHITECTURE LT\nBASS AUTOMOTIVE LIMITE\nFILESWAP GLOBAL LT\nHAB CLUB LT\nET HOMES LT\n\n## Main Malware Used\n\nThe SectorJ04 group mainly used their own backdoor, ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT, for\nhacking. They also used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) RAT, a legitimate remote\nmanagement software created in Russia. Backdoors are installed in infected systems and they\nalso distributed email stealers, botnet malware and ransomware through those backdoors.\n\nThey were recently confirmed to use additional backdoor called AdroMut and FlowerPippi, which\nis used to install other backdoor such as FlawedAmmy RAT on behalf of the MSI file, or to collect\nsystem information and send it to the attacker’s server.\n\n**Malware Types Found Before 2019**\n\n\n-----\n\nDownloaded\nby MSI\n\n\nNullsoft Installer Encoded FlawedAmmy\nRAT\n\n\nCharacteristic C2 response has cer‐\ntain separator\n\n**Malware Types Found After 2019**\n\n\nCheck for Antivirus\nRegister AutoPlay with\n“wsus.exe”\n\n\nSFX File\n\nUtilize configuration files in\nDAT formats\n\n\n**Initial Infec‐**\n**tion Method**\n\n**Characteris‐**\n**tics**\n\n\n**AdroMut** **FlowerPippi**\n\nDocument files attached to the spear phishing emails\n\n\nInternal-used strings are decoded into AES-256ECB mode after base64 decode.\nConfigure infection system information in JSON\nformat (encrypted)\nLoad into “ComputerDefaults.exe” using DLL\nside loading technique\n\n\nA simpler function than hardcoded RC4 key AdroMut\n\n\nBackdoor installed in the infected system distributed additional botnet malware, ransomware and\nemail stealers. The email stealer collects connection protocol information and account\ninformation, such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3, which are stored in the registry by Outlook and\nThunderbird mail clients and sends them to the attacker server in a specific format.\n\nFigure 6 Format to send email credentials collected by email stealer\n\nFigure 7 Some of the email stealer codes that access email account information stored in the\nregistry\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 Some of the email stealer codes that access email account information stored in the\nregistry 2\n\nAn email stealer may also have a file collection function to collect email information that is\nrecorded in the metadata of the file corresponding to the hard-coded extension. In addition, the\nmalware eventually creates and executes a batch file for self-delete, removing the execution\ntraces from the infected PC.\n\nFigure 9 Some of the file extensions that the email stealer collects data from\n\nThe SectorJ04 group is believed to collect email accounts stored in infection systems for use in\nsubsequent attacks.\n\n## Characteristics of hacking activities of SectorJ04 group in 2019\n\nThe following are the features of the first half of 2019 activities identified through the analysis of\nthe SectorJ04 group’s hacking activities.\n\nIncreased hacking activities targeting East and Southeast Asia\nChanges in spam email format and hacking methods\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the SectorJ04 group mainly targeted countries located in Europe or North America, it\nhas recently expanded its field of activities to countries located in Southeast Asia and East Asia.\nIn particular, the frequency of hacking attacks targeting South Korea has increased, and spam\nemails targeting China were found in May.\n\nThe changes could also be seen in attachments to spam emails used by attackers. Existing spam\nemails used attachments in the form of malicious documents, but attachments with HTM and\nHTML extensions were also found and the text included links to download malicious documents\ndirectly.\n\nThe SectorJ04 group’s initial spam emails had no mail content or only short sentences, but the\nlatest spam emails found were elaborately written and included images. A new type of backdoor\ncalled AdroMut and a new malware called FlowerPippi was also found coming from SectorJ04.\n\nPrior to 2019, the SectorJ04 group conducted large-scale hacking activities for financial gain\nusing exploit kits on websites to install ransomware, such as Locky and GlobeImporter, along with\nits banking Trojan, on its victims computers. But after 2019 the group has changed its hacking\nstrategy to attack using spam email. In particular, a number of remote control malware are utilized\nto gain access to resources such as email accounts and system login information from the\ninfected machine to send more spam emails and distribute their malware.\n\n### Increased hacking activities targeting East and Southeast Asia\n\nThe hacking activities of SectorJ04 group, which targeted South Korea in the first half of 2019,\nhave been continuously discovered. The emails found were written in relation to invoice and tax\naccounting data, and were attached the MS Word or Excel files with malicious macros inserted.\nMalicious documents written in Korean have the same characteristics as other language hacking\nactivities under the theme of MS Office.\n\nFigure 10 Spear phishing emails\ndisguised as order sheets\n\nIn June 2019, continuous hacking\nactivities targeting South Korea were\nfound again and spam emails were\nwritten with various contents,\nincluding transaction statements,\nreceipts and remittance cards. During\nthat period, a number of spam emails\ndisguised as remittance cards of the\nsame type were found.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11 Spear phishing email disguised as a remittance card\n\nThe SectorJ04 group has carried out large-scale hacking activities targeting South Korea, while\nalso expanding the field of attacks to Southeast Asian countries such as Taiwan and the\nPhilippines. Spam emails and attachments written in Chinese were found in May, and the\nSectorJ04 group at that time targeted industrial sectors such as electronics and\ntelecommunications, international schools and manufacturing.\n\nFigure 12 Spear phishing emails written in Chinese\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13 Malicious excel file execution screen written in Chinese\n\n### Changes in spam email format and hacking methods\n\nIn June, SectorJ04 group conducted hacking using spam emails written in various languages,\nincluding English, Arabic, Korean and Italian, and the emails were written with various contents,\nincluding remittance card, invoice and tax invoice.\n\nAlong with the existing method of using MS Word or Excel files as attachments, they used HTML\nfiles to download malicious documents as attachments, or included links to download malicious\ndocuments directly in the text.\n\nIn the past, the emails used in attacks had little or no content, but the latest ones use elaborated\nspam emails for hacking, such as using images.\n\nFigure 14 Spear phishing email disguised as bank statement\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15 Spear phishing email disguised as a hospital certificate\n\nChanges have also been found in the hacking method of the SectorJ04 group. In addition to their\npreexist backdoor, ServHelper and FlawedAmmy, they have also been confirmed to use the\nbackdoor called AdroMut and FlowerPippi.\n\nAdroMut downloads the malware (ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT) used by the SectorJ04\ngroup from the attacker server and simultaneously performs the functions of a backdoor.\n\nFlowerPippi collects infection system information, such as the domain of the infected system,\nproxy settings, administrator rights, and OS version, and performs functions such as executing\ncommands received, downloading and executing DLL and EXE files.\n\nFigure 16 Encoded Strings on the AdroMut Backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17 RC4 key with hard-coded view from the FlowerPippi back door\n\nThe SectorJ04 group is believed to have developed and used malware that functions as a\ndownloader for the purpose of installing or downloading malware to replace the MSI installation\nfiles that they have used for hacking for more than six months as the detection rate of security\nsolutions increased.\n\nFigure 18 Some of the digital certificate information identified in the corresponding hacking activity\n\nThe SectorJ04 group, which has been utilizing the same pattern of infection and the same\nmalware for more than six months, is believed to be attempting to change its infection methods\nsuch as downloading malware directly from malicious documents without using MSI installation\nfiles, changing their spam email format and using new types of backdoor.\n\n### Changes in hacking targets from specific organizations and industries to random ones\n\nUntil 2019, SectorJ04 group had carried out massive website-based hacking activities that mainly\nutilize ransomware and banking trojans for financial profit, and has also been carrying out\ninformation gathering activities to secure attack resources such as email accounts and system\nlogin information from users since 2019.\n\nThis allows them to expand their range of targets of hacking activities for financial profit and in\n\n\n-----\n\nThey eventually hacked the Active Directory (AD) server and took control of the entire corporate\ninternal network, and then distributed the Clop ransomware on the AD server. From the hacking\nactivity, we also found malware for collecting email information and “AmadeyBot”, a botnet\nmalware that which has its source code available in Russia’s underground forums.\n\nFigure 19 Spear phishing email used\nfor hacking activities targeting AD\nservers in South Korea\n\nThey are believed to have\ncontinuously attempted to hack into\ncompanies in South Korea to\ndistribute Clop ransomware.\nAttackers used spam emails\ndisguised as being sent by the\nNational Tax Service in May to install\nFlawedAmmy RAT in the infected\nsystem, during which the Clop\nransomware was found using the\nsame certificate as the FlawedAmmy\nRAT executable file.\n\nFigure 20 Spear phishing email\ndisguised as tax bill\n\nThe SectorJ04 group has shown a\npattern of hacking activities that have\nchanged from targeted attacks to a\nlarge-scale distribution of spam.\n\n## Major Malware Installation Types\n\nThe following describes three types of backdoor infections that are installed from malicious\ndocuments identified in the SectorJ04 group-related hacking cases that occurred during the first\nhalf of 2019.\n\n### Type 1 – Using encoded executable file\n\nSectorJ04 group carried out intensive hacking on various industrial sectors, including South\nKorea’s media, manufacturing and universities, around February and March 2019. They used the\nspear phishing email to spread malicious Excel or malicious Word files, and downloaded the MSI\nfiles from the attacker’s server when the malicious documents were run\n\n\n-----\n\nThe MSI file installs a downloader that downloads FlawedAmmy RAT encoded in the infection\nsystem from the attacker server, and the downloaded FlawedAmmy RAT registers an automatic\nexecution under the name “wsus.exe.”\n\nFigure 21 Type of backdoor installation to install encoded executable file Type 1\n\nFlawedAmmy RAT performs remote control functions in the infected system and decodes\nencoded executable files downloaded from the attacker server using certain hard-coded strings. It\nalso has a function to check if a particular process is running to determine whether their malware\nshould be executed.\n\nFigure 22 “Ammy Admin” string found in FlawedAmmy RAT\n\nFigure 23 Part of decode code that uses hard-coded strings\n\n### Type 2 Using NSIS Script\n\n\n-----\n\nSectorJ04 group conducted hacking activities targeting financial institutions located in India and\nHong Kong around April 2019. Malicious documents delivered through the spear phishing email\ndownloaded the MSI file, which forwards the NSIS Installer to the infected system. The NSIS\nscript executes the final payload, ServHelper, in the DLL file format, using “rundll32.exe”.\n\nNote that NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a script-based installation system for\nWindows and is a lightweight installation system supported by Nullsoft.\n\nFigure 24 Backdoor installation type utilizing NSIS Installer Type 2\n\nDecompressing the NSIS installer installed by the MSI file shows that it consists of an NSIS script\nwith an NSI extension, a ServHelper in the DLL file format, and a “ncExec.dll,” the normal DLL\nrequired to run the NSIS.\n\nFigure 25 Uncompressed NSIS installer\n\nFigure 26 Part of the NSIS script for running ServHelper in the DLL file format\n\nServHelper performs the function of the backdoor in the infection system and sends specific types\nof responses to C2 servers using delimiters such as “key,” “sysid,” and “resp”. Different types of\ndelimiters are sometimes found depending on malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nSectorJ04 group carried out hacking activities targeting financial institutions located in Italy and\nother countries around May 2019. Malicious documents delivered through the spear phishing\nemail pass MSI files to the infection system, and MSI files download the executable selfextracting file (SFX). When the SFX file is executed, another SFX file inside is executed and the\nfinal payload, RMS RAT, is delivered to the infected system.\n\nFigure 28 Backdoor installation type utilizing SFX executable files Type 3\n\nWithin the first SFX file to be downloaded by the MSI file, there are four files. When executing an\nSFX file, it uses a command to change the extension of the SFX file (“kernel.dll”) of the DLL\nextension to EXE and decompress it using a hard-coded password. The files that make up the\nSFX file vary from malware to malware.\n\nFigure 29 The first SFX file to be downloaded from an MSI file\n\nFigure 30 “i.cmd” for decompression of the second SFX file\n\n\n-----\n\nsoftware created in Russia, and files with DAT extensions contain configuration information to run\nthe RMS RAT.\n\nFigure 31 Configuring a second SFX file disguised as a DLL file extension\n\nFigure 32 RMS RAT configuration file with a DAT extension\n\n## SectorJ04 Group Activity in South Korea\n\nThe following is about the activities of the SectorJ04 group found in South Korea in July and\nAugust 2019.\n\n### Hacking activities disguised as electronic tickets by large airlines\n\nIn late July, SectorJ04 group used FlawedAmmy RAT to carry out hacking attacks on companies\nand universities in sectors such as education, job openings, real estate and semiconductors in\nSouth Korea. Spam emails targeting email accounts used in the integrated mail service of public\nofficials were also found in the hacking activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 33 Spam email disguised as electronic tickets\n\nThey used spam emails disguised as those sent by large South Korean airlines and used ISOformat files as attachments. The group used the same body contents of the email to deliver spam\nemails to multiple hacking targets.\n\nDecompressing the ISO file attached to the spam email would show an SCR file disguised as a\n“.pdf” extension exists, which is a .NET executable file that downloads an MSI file. The ISO files\nsometimes contain LNK files, which, like the malware written in .NET, download an MSI files from\na remote location.\n\nFigure 34 A disguised SCR file identified within an ISO file\n\nFigure 35 MSI file downloader written as .NET\n\nFigure 36 Disguised LNK file identified within\nISO file\n\nThe following valid digital signatures were\nfound in the MSI file downloaded from the\nattacker server. Other digital signatures were\nalso found issued by “HAB CLUB LT” and\n“LUK 4 TRANSPORT LT”.\n\nFigure 37 Digital signature information for MSI files found in hacking activities\n\nFinally, FlawedAmmy RAT is downloaded from the remote server and the activity uses a Base64\nencoded Powershell script to determine if the infected system is a PC contained in an Active\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 38 Powershell script to determine if a PC belongs to a domain\n\n### Hacking activity using same email content as the past\n\nIn early August, the SectorJ04 group carried out extensive hacking activities targeting the users\naround the world, including South Korea, India, Britain, the United States, Germany, Canada,\nArgentina, Bangladesh and Hong Kong.\n\nTheir activities were particularly heavy in healthcare-related areas such as healthcare,\npharmaceuticals, biotechnology and healthcare-wage management, as well as energy-related\ncompanies such as gas and wind power. Also, they continued their attacks on preexisting hacking\ntarget areas such as manufacturing, distribution and retail.\n\nThe contents of the text written in French and English were found in the spam email, and an MS\nWord file with random numbers was used as an attachment. All emails found in the hacking\nactivity had the same text content.\n\nFigure 39 Spear phishing emails written in French and English\n\nSpam emails in Korean were also identified in the hacking activity, indicating that the contents of\nthe text of the email used in the hacking activity were reused in June. Attached file is an MS Word\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 40 Spear phishing email\ntargeted to South Korea using the\nsame text used in the past\n\nThe MS Word file used as an\nattachment is disguised as an order\nconfirmation and a goods receipt.\nRunning the macro from the\ndocument would allow the\ndownloader with the DLL file format to\nrun using “rundll32.exe”. The\ndownloader downloads FlawedAmmy\nRAT from the attacker server and\nruns under the name “rundl32.exe”.\n\nFigure 41 Malicious document execution screen disguised as order confirmation\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 42 Malicious document execution screen for Korea language users disguised as a receipt\nof goods\n\nFigure 43 Part of the macro script included in the malicious document\n\nFlawedAmmy RAT found in the hacking activity showed the existing “Ammyy Admin” string being\nmodified to “Popss Admin” and created Mutex with “KLGjigjuw4j892358u432i5”. In addition, the\ncompile path “c:\\\\123\\\\123\\\\clear\\\\ammyygeneric\\\\target\\\\TrFmFileSys.h” was found inside the file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 45 Mutex generation code using\nhard-coded string information\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned\nchanges in the FlawedAmmy RAT found\nin the most recent hacking activity, other\nchanges such as changes in their string\ndecoding were identified.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SectorJ04 group’s range of targets increased sharply in 2019, and they appear to be striving\nto carry out elaborated attacks while at the same time targeting indiscriminately. They are one of\nthe most active cyber crime groups in 2019, and they often modify and tweak their hacking\nmethods and perform periodic hacking activities.\n\nThe SectorJ04 group’s hacking activities are expected to continue to increase, and the\nThreatRecon team will continue to monitor the attack activity against the group.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n[IoCs of the SectorJ04 group included in the report can be found here.](https://github.com/nshc-threatrecon/IoC-List)\n\nMore information about the SectorJ04 group is available to customers of ThreatRecon\nIntelligence Service (RA.global@nshc.net).\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\nThe following is a list of MITRE ATT&CK Techniques we have observed based on our analysis of\nthese malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Initial Access\n\nSpearphishing Attachment\nSpearphishing Link\nTrusted Relationship\n\n### Execution\n\nCommand-Line Interface\nExecution through API\nExecution through Module Load\nExploitation for Client Execution\nPowerShell\nRundll32\nScheduled Task\nScripting\nService Execution\nUser Execution\nWindows Management Instrumentation\n\n### Persistence\n\nAccount Manipulation\nNew Service\nRegistry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\n\n-----\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\nBypass User Account Control\nNew Service\nScheduled Task\nStartup items\n\n### Defense Evasion\n\nBypass User Account Control\nCode Signing\nDisabling Security Tools\nDLL Side-Loading\nExploitation for Defense Evasion\nHidden Window\nModify Registry\nObfuscated Files or Information\nRundll32\nScripting\nSoftware Packing\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\n### Credential Access\n\nAccount Manipulation\nInput Capture\nInput Prompt\n\n### Discovery\n\nAccount Discovery\nFile and Directory Discovery\nNetwork Service Scanning\nNetwork Share Discovery\nPermission Groups Discovery\nProcess Discovery\nQuery Registry\nRemote System Discovery\nSecurity Software Discovery\nSystem Information Discovery\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery\nSystem Network Connections Discovery\nSystem Owner/User Discovery\nSystem Service Discovery\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nRemote Desktop Protocol\n\n\n-----\n\nAutomated Collection\nData from Local System\nEmail Collection\nInput Capture\n\n### Command and Control\n\nCommonly Used Port\nCustom Command and Control Protocol\nCustom Cryptographic Protocol\nData Encoding\nRemote Access Tools\nStandard Application Layer Protocol\nStandard Cryptographic Protocol\n\n### Exfiltration\n\nAutomated Exfiltration\nData Compressed\nExfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\nExfiltration Over Command and Control Channel\n\n### Intent\n\nData Encrypted for Impact\n\n## References\n\n**KRCERT – Analysis of Attacks on AD Server (2019.04.17)**\nhttps://www.krcert.or.kr/data/reportView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence=35006\n\n\n-----",
