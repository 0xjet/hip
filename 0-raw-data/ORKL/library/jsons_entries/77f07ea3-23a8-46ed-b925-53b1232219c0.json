According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo)\n[Grumman, Morgan Stanley,[8] and Dow Chemical[9] were also among the targets.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely\n[uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google)\nacknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices.\n\n[1] Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S.\n\ngovernment.[10]\n\n\n[The attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Alperovitch)\n[Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAfee)\n[that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing))\n[of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)\nname was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief\nTechnology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.[11]\n\nAccording to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially\n[modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)\n[companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management)\nsecuring them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways\n—much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may\nhave and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"[12]\n\n## History\n\n\nOn January 12, 2010, Google revealed on its blog that it\nhad been the victim of a cyber attack. The company said\nthe attack occurred in mid-December and originated from\nChina. Google stated that over 20 other companies had\nbeen attacked; other sources have since cited that more\nthan 34 organizations were targeted.[9] As a result of the\nattack, Google said it was reviewing its business in China.\n\n[[1] On the same day, United States Secretary of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State)\n\n[Hillary Clinton issued a brief statement condemning the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton)\nattacks and requesting a response from China.[13]\n\n\nFlowers left outside Google\nChina's headquarters after its\n\nannouncement it might leave\n\n\nthe country\n\n[On January 13, 2010, the news agency All Headline News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency)\n[reported that the United States Congress plans to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)\ninvestigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service\nto spy on human rights activists.[14]\n\n\n[In Beijing, visitors left flowers outside of Google's office. However, these were later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing)\nremoved, with a Chinese security guard stating that this was an \"illegal flower tribute\".\nThe Chinese government has yet to issue a formal response, although an anonymous\nofficial stated that China was seeking more information on Google's intentions.[16]\n\n## Attackers involved\n\n\n\n[15]\n\n\n-----\n\n[Further information: Cyberwarfare by China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare_by_China)\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other\nfactors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group\n[was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NortonLifeLock)\n[referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secureworks)\nGoogle's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists.[17]\nElderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms,\nenergy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.[2][18]\n\nThe \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is\nAPT17.[19]\n\n\nElderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers\nthat make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms\nthen become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One\nattack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by\nemployees of the target company – a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a\nwatering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that\ndownloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the\nnetwork to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading\nexecutives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and\nproduct designs.[2]\n\n## Attack analysis\n\n[In its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property)\n[suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail)\n[dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissidents)\nattacked, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state\nsecurity agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected\ncrimes\".[20] However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and\nthose details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation\ndate.[1]\n\n\nSecurity experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack.[11] Two days after the\nattack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zeroday vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in\n[Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer)\n[McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue,[21] and admitted that they had known about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)\nthe security hole used since September.[22] Additional vulnerabilities were found in\n[Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.[23][24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforce)\n\n[VeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VeriSign)\nChinese state or proxies thereof\".[25]\n\n\n-----\n\n[According to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak)\n[reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China)\nsystems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed\nby \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the\nChinese government.\"[26] The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in\n[which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States)\n[allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\"[27] According to The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama)\nGuardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of\nthe Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and\nfound articles criticising him personally.\"[28]\n\nOnce a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an\n[SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)\n[Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rackspace)\ncustomer accounts. The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate\nintranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of\n[intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control)\n\n\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and\ncontrol servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the\nattackers intentionally shut them down.[29] However, the attacks were still occurring as of\nFebruary 2010.[3]\n\n## Response and aftermath\n\n\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of\nInternet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until\na fix for the security hole was made.[30][31][32] The German, Australian, and French\ngovernments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially\nvulnerable.[33][34]\n\nIn an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and\nother U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The\nvulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows\nXP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000\nService Pack 4.[35]\n\n\nThe Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public\n[domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasploit_Project)\ntool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing\nweb-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of\nCalifornia, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility\nof widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO\nof McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft\nattacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"[36]\n\n\n-----\n\n[Security company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websense)\nvulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites.[37]\nAccording to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went\npublic last week. \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to\nthe public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the\npossibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee,\n[in a blog update.[38] Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified](http://siblog.mcafee.com/cto/dealing-with-%E2%80%9Coperation-aurora%E2%80%9D-related-attacks/)\nadditional sites using the exploit on January 19.[39] According to reports from Ahnlab, the\nsecond URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a\npopular IM client in South Korea.[39]\n\nResearchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7\n(IE7) and IE8—even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution\nPrevention (DEP)) is turned on. According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability\nresearcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP\nService Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the\nversion Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"[40]\n\nMicrosoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September.\n\n[22] Work on an update was prioritized[41] and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft\n\nreleased a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on\nit and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities.[42] They did not state if any of\nthe latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular\nrelation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for\nmost versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\n\n\n[Security researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBGary)\nreleased a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that\nmight help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese\nlanguage based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.[43]\n\nOn February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has\nclaimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks\nmade on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also\ntracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools,\n[Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School.[44] As highlighted by The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University)\n_[New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu)_\n[rival of Google China.[45] Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_China)\nthe allegation.[46][47]\n\n\n[In March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NortonLifeLock)\n[Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaoxing)\nworld.[48]\n\n## See also\n\n\n-----\n\n## References\n\n1. ^ Jump up to:   a b c d e _[\"A new approach to China\".
