This program is intended to be used for\neducational purposes only. Mercurial is only used to demonstrate what type of information\nattackers can grab from a user's computer. This is a project was created to make it easier for\nmalware analysts or ordinary users to understand how credential grabbing works and can be\nused for analysis, research, reverse engineering, or review.\n\nWhat is malware?\n\nMalware is a term that is used for malicious software that is designed to do damage or\nunwanted actions to a computer system.\n\nAn explanation of this tool:\n\nGoogle Chrome always store user data in the same place, so the stealer generated by\nMercurial Grabber has no problem in finding it. In theory at least, this data is stored in\nencrypted form. However, if the malware has already penetrated the system, then its actions\nare done in your name.\n\nTherefore, the malware simply finds a way to decrypt information stored on your computer\n(by making it seem like thie user is requesting it) . The stealer gets all your passwords and\ncookies.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tool is also able to find Roblox cookies that are stored in the Windows Registry. By\nrunning the malicious .exe file, it is able to search for the Roblox cookie. The same goes for\nMinecraft sessions, Discord tokens, etc since it is stored in the user's computer.\n\nRecommended tools for testing Mercurial: (when running the produced output after building)\n\nVirtualbox\nVMware\nProcess Hacker\nVirusTotal\n\nTips to check if an exe file is safe:\n\nAnalyze the file with VirusTotal\nCheck if the exe file has a publisher\nCheck it in a sandbox\nMonitor the file’s network activity for strange behavior\n\n### Educational Purposes Only\n\nThis tool demonstrates and makes it easy to create your own grabber. This shows what type\nof information attackers can grab from a victim's computer. Only use this on your own PC\nand do not use it on other people maliciously.\n\n\n-----",
