The Morphisec Threat Labs team has been tracing its\nactivities using our prevention telemetry along with dark-web activities.\n\nIn this blog post however, we aren’t going to cover Aurora, but a sometimes overlooked, extremely\ncritical component of the attack delivery chain. The component that makes Aurora’s delivery stealthy\nand dangerous is a highly evasive loader we named “in2al5d p3in4er.”\n\n[The in2al5d p3in4er loader is compiled with Embarcadero RAD Studio and targets endpoint](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio)\nworkstations using advanced anti-VM (virtual machine) technique we describe in detail in this post.\n\nWe also cover new techniques with significant negative outcomes that represent a concerning change\nin the landscape, especially in the new era of ChatGPT.\n\n## Delivery\n\nThreat actors always find innovative ways to spread malware and access sensitive information. One\n[growing trend is using YouTube as a malware distribution channel. Hackers take over popular YouTube](https://cloudsek.com/blog/threat-actors-abuse-ai-generated-youtube-videos-to-spread-stealer-malware)\naccounts and post videos with links to malicious websites or downloads. To increase video visibility,\nthey use search engine optimization (SEO) tags to make a video rank higher in search results.\n\nStealing YouTube accounts is a lucrative business for cybercriminals. Many underground forums and\nmarketplaces offer these services for a fee. The threat actor in this post appears to be using this\nmethod as a service, including the websites the videos redirect to.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Compromised YouTube channel_\n\nThe service uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate videos. This streamlines the process of creating\nconvincing budget backed content. And it allows threat actors to automate diverse lure creation, such\nas fake software that tricks users into clicking on links.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example video with download instructions_\n\nThe above video redirects to different websites that look legitimate.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fake websites redirected by the YouTube video_\n\nThe service the threat actors are using enables the creation of decoy websites that look identical to the\noriginal websites. These fake websites use similar URLs, logos, and branding to convincingly appear\nlegitimate. Once a user visits one of these sites, they’re enticed to download an application containing\nmalware or lured to enter sensitive/personal information into the decoy generated website. These\nwebsites use geographical targeting to deliver content based on the visitor’s geo-location.\n\nThe website below is a clone of jobseeker.com\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decoy website for jobseeker.com_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThis loader uses a surprisingly simple yet highly effective evasion technique. It leverages the usage of\nCreateDXGIFactory function of dxgi.dll library to query the vendor ID of the graphics card installed on a\nsystem. The ID is then compared against a whitelist of vendor IDs; specifically, the 0x10de (NVIDIA),\n0x1002 (AMD), and 0x8086 (Intel) graphics cards. If the vendor ID doesn’t match the whitelisted values,\nthe loader makes it appear as a benign application by terminating itself.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The anti-VM function checks the graphics vendor ID_\n\nAfter checking the vendor IDs, the loader decrypts the final payload in separate chunks and injects it\ninto `sihost.exe` using a process hollowing technique.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Payload decryption routine_\n\nSome samples of the loader do not use the process hollowing technique. Instead, they allocate memory\nto write the decrypted payload into the allocated memory, and then make a call to the payload entry\npoint (EP).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Payload injection_\n\nDuring the injection process, all loader samples resolve the necessary Win APIs dynamically and\ndecrypt these names using a XOR key: \"in2al5d p3in4er\" (invalid printer), as illustrated in the figure\nbelow.\n\n_String decryption routine using the \"invalid printer\" key_\n\nAnother element helping the low detection rate on VirusTotal is the threat actor using Embarcadero\nRAD Studio to generate executables. Embarcadero RAD Studio is an integrated development\nenvironment (IDE) for building software applications that runs on various platforms and operating\nsystems.\n\nExamining samples from our investigation, we found the threat actor is compiling executables using\nseveral options from the Embarcadero IDE. Those with the lowest detection rate on VirusTotal are\ncompiled using “BCC64.exe”, a new Clang based C++ compiler from Embarcadero. This compiler is\nbased on a different code base than a “Standard Library” (Dinkumware) or “Runtime Library” (compilerrt) and generates optimized code which changes the entry point and execution flow. This breaks\nsecurity vendors’ indicators, such as signatures composed from “malicious/suspicious code block.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_A zero detection rate on VirusTotal_\n\nThe loader is particularly successful in evading sandboxes and virtual machines. As seen in the image\nbelow, the loader has evaded execution by multiple sandboxes. This is a testament to the effectiveness\nof the loader's simplicity, which leverages a specific aspect of system configuration to achieve\nexceptional stealth.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Example of sandboxes that fail to execute_\n\nNote: A similar technique for evading virtual machines was [covered in 2016. It checked the graphics’](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/sfg-furtims-parent/#:~:text=Direct3D)\ncard vendor ID using the DXGI.dll. Although the anti-VM techniques observed in the wild are generally\nbased on blacklisting, this approach uses an inverse check which only searches for graphic cards the\ntarget victim should own. This helps to evade sandbox analysis that searches for blacklists of graphic\ncards.\n\n## Defending Against in2al5d p3in4er\n\nMalware loaders like in2al5d p3in4er are essentially basic delivery. They establish a foothold between\nan attacker and their compromised target and are typically the first stage of an attack.\n\nThe attackers behind in2al5d p3in4er are combining it with widely accessible social engineering tools\nfor a high impact campaign that takes over popular YouTube accounts and directs viewers to\nconvincing looking fake websites. They’re then enticed to download malware from a fake website.\n\nOne of the first steps to avoid compromise by in2al5d p3in4er is training organization employees how to\ndetect social engineering campaigns: ensuring URLs are legitimate, and not downloading cracked\nversions of software.\n\nBut as the detection ratio of zero on VirusTotal makes clear, reactive, detection-based cybersecurity\ntechnologies like those used in NGAV, EPP, and EDR/XDR are barely capable of detecting and\nstopping in2al5d p3in4er. Stopping this loader requires different technology.\n\nMorphisec’s Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) technology takes a fundamentally different\napproach to cybersecurity that isn’t detection-based. Instead of waiting for malware to breach a system\nbefore detecting it, Morphisec proactively secures runtime memory to prevent any unauthorized code—\nlike in2al5d p3in4er—from executing, regardless of whether a recognizable signature or behavior\npattern exists for it.
