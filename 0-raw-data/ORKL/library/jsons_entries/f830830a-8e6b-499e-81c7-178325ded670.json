    "plain_text": "# Leveraging ZeuS to send spam through social networks\n\n**[malwareint.blogspot.com/2010/01/leveraging-zeus-to-send-spam-through.html](http://malwareint.blogspot.com/2010/01/leveraging-zeus-to-send-spam-through.html)**\n\nWe were able to analyze a pack to make zombies of ZeuS at spammers through social\nnetworks. Specifically, the module is analyzed developed for use in Vkontakte.ru, the\nRussian clone of Facebook.\n\nThis crimeware has been created by someone calling himself Deex of Freedomscripts Team\nand sold for the modest price of USD 100 (via WebMoney).\n\nThe pack includes several configuration files, which make it:\n\n**config.ini: has defined the target (friends or online, although so far only seems to work**\nthe first option) and password of the administrator control panel. When selecting\nfriends, messages are sent to all our contacts, but are not online at that time.\n**message.txt: contains the text of the message to send.**\n**title.txt: contains the title of the message to send.**\n**results.txt: here were keeping the infected user statistics (vkontakte identifier, IP and**\nnumber of messages sent).\n**webinjects.txt: HTML code injected in the sitting of infected PCs sending spam trigger.**\n\nThe contents of that file should be added (or completely replace) the file of the same name\nnecessary to build binaries of ZeuS, and then reconstruct the configuration file and the\nexecutable of ZeuS.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the victim s PC is infected with this executable as well as sending a typical ZeuS\nreports, will check the page you visited and if the addition of Vkontakte.ru and be in English\n(does not work in other languages), activate the injection of code in the page, which always\nmaintains the appearance of authenticity.\n\nFrom that moment, all requests are processed by the HTML page that handles getconfig.php\nlater call to the real page to avoid suspicion, showing the user the actual content as you surf\nvkontakte.ru its pages; while below, sends a message every time you click a link from the\npage js.php, as seen in the following snippet from log:\n\nThe result can be seen in the sent items, where all messages that have been sending our\ncontacts:\n\n\n-----\n\nAll this is managed from a panel of independent control of ZeuS, which requires no database\nto run, since configuration and reporting are in separate text files.\n\nThe control panel is simple enough. It has a blank login page with a box to put the password\nthat gives access to the panel itself, with a menu of 5 options:\n\n**Reports: shows the result of sending spam. In our example, the ID has sent 20**\nmessages from the specified IP.\n\n**Inject: shows the code injection (webinjects.txt) and links to three pages responsible**\nfor performing tasks involving the shipment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Settings: From here you can manage the configuration files to change the password**\nand set the title and body of the message to send. This data is stored in the\nconfiguration files mentioned above.\n\n**Help: A brief page with some indication of what this pack and the two component parts:**\nInject and Admin.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Logout. To exit the control panel.**\n\nIn short, this package demonstrates how easy it's to take advantage of belonging to a botnet\nzombies under the control of ZeuS for the sending of messages through social networks.\nAlthough this case concerns only in the first instance, to Vkontakte.ru, adapt it to other social\nnetworks or use it for other attacks through web pages, such as making fraudulent clicks, it\nwould be pretty easy.\nRelated Information\n\n[ZeuS Botnet y su poder de reclutamiento zombi](http://www.blogger.com/ZeuS,%20spam%20y%20certificados%20SSL%20Eficacia%20de%20los%20antivirus%20frente%20a%20ZeuS%20Especial%21%21%20ZeuS%20Botnet%20for%20Dummies%20Botnet.%20Securizaci%C3%83%C2%B3n%20en%20la%20nueva%20versi%C3%83%C2%B3n%20de%20ZeuS%20Fusi%C3%83%C2%B3n.%20Un%20concepto%20adoptado%20por%20el%20crimeware%20actual%20ZeuS%20Carding%20World%20Template.%20%28...%29%20la%20cara%20de%20la%20botnet%20Entidades%20financieras%20en%20la%20mira%20de%20la%20botnet%20Zeus%20II%20Entidades%20financieras%20en%20la%20mira%20de%20la%20botnet%20Zeus%20I%20LuckySploit,%20la%20mano%20derecha%20de%20Zeus%20ZeuS%20Botnet.%20Masiva%20propagaci%C3%83%C2%B3n%20de%20su%20troyano%20II%20ZeuS%20Botnet.%20Masiva%20propagaci%C3%83%C2%B3n%20de%20su%20troyano%20I)\n[ZeuS, spam y certificados SSL](http://mipistus.blogspot.com/2009/10/zeus-spam-y-certificados-ssl.html)\n[Eficacia de los antivirus frente a ZeuS](http://mipistus.blogspot.com/2009/09/eficacia-de-los-antivirus-frente-zeus.html)\n[Especial!!
