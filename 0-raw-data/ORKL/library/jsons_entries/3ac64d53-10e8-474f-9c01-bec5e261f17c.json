But it becomes all the more disturbing when those\nunidentified intruders are identified—and appear likely to be part of a notorious team of\n[cyberspies working in the service of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU.](https://www.wired.com/tag/fancy-bear)\n\n[Last week the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency published an advisory that](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-268a)\nhackers had penetrated a US federal agency. It identified neither the attackers nor the\nagency, but did detail the hackers' methods and their use of a new and unique form of\nmalware in an operation that successfully stole target data. Now, clues uncovered by a\nresearcher at cybersecurity firm Dragos and an FBI notification to hacking victims obtained\nby WIRED in July suggest a likely answer to the mystery of who was behind the intrusion:\nThey appear to be Fancy Bear, a team of hackers working for Russia's GRU. Also known as\nAPT28, the group has been responsible for everything from hack-and-leak operations\ntargeting the 2016 US presidential election to a broad campaign of attempted intrusions\ntargeting political parties, consultancies, and campaigns this year.\n\n\"They’re a formidable actor, and they're still capable of getting access to sensitive areas.\"\n\nJohn Hultquist, FireEye\n\n\n-----\n\nThe clues pointing to APT28 are based in part on a notification the FBI sent to targets of a\nhacking campaign in May of this year, [which WIRED obtained. The notification warned that](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-fancy-bear-us-hacking-campaign-government-energy/)\nAPT28 was broadly targeting US networks, including government agencies and educational\ninstitutions, and listed several IP addresses they were using in their operations. Dragos\nresearcher Joe Slowik noticed that one IP address identifying a server in Hungary used in\nthat APT28 campaign matched an IP address listed in the CISA advisory. That would\nsuggest that APT28 used the same Hungarian server in the intrusion described by CISA—\nand that at least one of the attempted intrusions described by the FBI was successful.\n\n\"Based on the infrastructure overlap, the series of behaviors associated with the event, and\nthe general timing and targeting of the US government, this seems to be something very\nsimilar to—if not a part of—the campaign linked to APT28 earlier this year,\" says Slowik, the\nformer head of Los Alamos National Labs’ Computer Emergency Response Team.\n\nAside from that FBI notification, Slowik also found a second infrastructure connection. A\nreport last year from the Department of Energy warned that APT28 had probed a US\ngovernment organization's network from a server in Latvia, listing that server's IP address.\nAnd that Latvian IP address, too, reappeared in the hacking operation described in the CISA\nadvisory. Together, those matching IPs create a web of shared infrastructure that ties the\noperations together. \"There are one-to-one overlaps in the two cases,\" Slowik says.\n\nConfusingly, some of the IP addresses listed in the FBI, DOE, and CISA documents also\nseem to overlap with known cybercriminal operations, Slowik notes, such as Russian fraud\nforums and servers used by banking trojans. But he suggests that means Russia's statesponsored hackers are most likely reusing cybercriminal infrastructure, perhaps to create\ndeniability. WIRED reached out to CISA, as well as the FBI and DOE, but none responded to\nour request for comment.\n\nAlthough it doesn't name APT28, CISA's advisory does detail step-by-step how the hackers\ncarried out their intrusion inside an unidentified federal agency. The hackers had somehow\nobtained working usernames and passwords for multiple employees, which they used to gain\nentry onto the network. CISA admits it doesn't know how those credentials were obtained,\nbut the report speculates that the attackers may have used a known vulnerability in Pulse\nSecure VPNs that CISA says has been exploited widely across the federal government.\n\nThe intruders then used command line tools to move among the agency's machines, before\ndownloading a piece of custom malware. They then used that malware to access the\nagency's file server and move collections of files to machines the hackers controlled,\ncompressing them into .zip files they could more easily steal.\n\nWhile CISA didn't make a sample of the hackers' custom trojan available to researchers,\nsecurity researcher Costin Raiu says that the attributes of the malware matched another\nsample uploaded to the malware research repository VirusTotal from somewhere in the\nUnited Arab Emirates. By analyzing that sample, Raiu found that it appears to be a unique\n\n\n-----\n\ncreation built from a combination of the common hacking tools Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike,\nbut with no obvious links to known hackers, and obfuscated with multiple layers of\nencryption. \"That wrapping makes it kind of interesting,\" says Raiu, director of Kaspersky's\nglobal research and analysis team. \"It is kind of unusual and rare in the sense that we\ncouldn’t find connections with anything else.\"\n\nEven aside from their 2016 breaches of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton\ncampaign, Russia's APT28 hackers loom over the 2020 election. Earlier this month Microsoft\n[warned that the group has been carrying out mass-scale, relatively simple techniques to](https://www.wired.com/story/russias-fancy-bear-hackers-are-hitting-us-campaign-targets-again/)\nbreach election-related organizations and campaigns on both sides of the political aisle.\nAccording to Microsoft, the group has used a combination of password-spraying that tries\ncommon passwords across many users' accounts and password brute-forcing that tries\nmany passwords against a single account.\n\nBut if APT28 is indeed the hacker group described in the CISA advisory, it's a reminder that\nthey're also capable of more sophisticated and targeted spying operations, says John\nHultquist, the director of intelligence at security firm FireEye, which didn't independently\nconfirm Slowik's findings linking the CISA report to APT28. \"They’re a formidable actor, and\nthey're still capable of getting access to sensitive areas,\" says Hultquist.\n\nAPT28, before its more recent hack-and-leak operations of the last few years, has a long\nhistory of espionage operations that have targeted US, NATO, and Eastern European\ngovernment and military targets. The CISA advisory, along with the DOE and FBI findings\nthat track related APT28 hacking campaigns, all suggest that those spying operations\ncontinue today.\n\n\"It's certainly not surprising that Russian intelligence would be trying penetrate the US\ngovernment. That's kind of what they do,\" says Slowik. \"But it is worth identifying that not\nonly is such activity continuing, it's been successful.\"\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n[📩 Want the latest on tech, science, and more?
