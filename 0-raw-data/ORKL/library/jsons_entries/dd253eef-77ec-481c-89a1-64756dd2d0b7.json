Local reporters who shared\ndetails about the ransomware incident on Twitter were admonished and told to delete tweets.\n\nThe company did, however, formally confirm the attack in October, [four months later, but](https://therecord.media/four-months-later-cox-media-confirms-ransomware-attack/)\nwithout mentioning any details about the Iranian hackers.\n\nThe revelation that Iranian hackers were behind the Cox attack comes a month after the US\nDepartment of Justice [charged two Iranian nationals in November on several hacking-related](https://therecord.media/us-charges-iranian-hackers-for-spoofed-proud-boys-emails-threatening-us-voters/)\ncharges. One of them was for the hacking of a US media company, with the intention of\ndisseminating false news via its website regarding the legality of the US 2020 Presidential\n[election. The company was later identified as Lee Enterprises, the operator of news sites like](https://www.techmeme.com/211119/p20#a211119p20)\nBuffalo News, the Arizona Daily Star, and the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nAccording to a Microsoft threat intelligence report on the group, DEV-0270 has historically\nengaged in both intelligence collection operations and financially-motivated attacks alike,\nwhich muddies the real motivation behind the recent Cox ransomware attack.\n\nThe tactic of deploying ransomware on the networks of large companies is a tactic that was\n[first seen used by Iranian hackers, namely by the SamSam group, in late 2016.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/AA18-337A)\n\nTheir method of targeting large companies rather than end consumers was eventually\nadopted by most of the ransomware threat actor landscape and is today known as “big-game\nhunting.”\n\nSince then, most ransomware attacks have been linked to Russian-based groups; however,\nin recent years, some ransomware incidents have also been linked to members of statesponsored espionage groups based in Iran, China, and North Korea.\n\nThese groups deployed ransomware on the networks of some of their victims as a way to\nmonetize hacked companies that have no intelligence-collection value or as a way to hide\nintelligence collection under a more generic ransomware incident that wouldn’t trigger a more\nin-depth investigation.\n\nCox Media Group spokespersons did not return requests for comment about the May-June\nintrusion.\n\nTags\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[Cox](https://therecord.media/tag/cox/)\n[Cox Media Group](https://therecord.media/tag/cox-media-group/)\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[DEV-0270](https://therecord.media/tag/dev-0270/)\n[Iran](https://therecord.media/tag/iran/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
