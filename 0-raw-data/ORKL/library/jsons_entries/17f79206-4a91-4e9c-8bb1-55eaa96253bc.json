End users and companies\ncan check if their email addresses had been seen in Emotet email campaigns using\nthe [Have I Been Pwned service or a](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) [special website created by Dutch police.](https://www.politie.nl/algemeen/controleer-of-mijn-inloggegevens-zijn-gestolen.html)\n\n[Dutch police](https://therecord.media/tag/dutch-police/)\n[email](https://therecord.media/tag/email/)\n[email account](https://therecord.media/tag/email-account/)\n[Emotet](https://therecord.media/tag/emotet/)\n[Have I Been Pwned](https://therecord.media/tag/have-i-been-pwned/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[password reset](https://therecord.media/tag/password-reset/)\n\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
