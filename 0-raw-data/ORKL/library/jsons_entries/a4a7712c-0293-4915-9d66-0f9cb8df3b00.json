According to\nKaspersky, NullMixer is spread via malicious websites related to cracks, keygens, and\nactivators used for software piracy. Most NullMixer activity was observed targeting users in\nthe US, Brazil, India, Russia, Italy, Germany, France, Egypt, and Turkey.\n\nThe threat actors behind NullMixer employ sophisticated SEO to stay near the top of search\nresults. When unwitting victims attempt to download software from the sites, they experience\nmultiple redirects, eventually landing on a page containing an archived password-protected\nfile. While the victims think they are downloading the desired software, the archive actually\ncontains NullMixer.\n\nNullMixer drops the following malware families:\n\n**SmokeLoader**\n\nSmokeLoader is a modular malware primarily used to download and execute other payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n**RedLine Stealer**\n\nRedLine Stealer is a stealer malware that harvests various types of information, including\nsaved credentials, autocomplete data, cryptocurrency, and credit card information. It also\ntakes a system inventory of the victim’s machine, gathering information on the username,\nlocation data, hardware configuration, and installed security software. RedLine Stealer can\nalso upload and download files, execute commands, and send information about the infected\ncomputer to the C2.\n\n**PseudoManuscrypt**\n\nPseudoManuscrypt is a MaaS (malware as a service) used to steal cookies from multiple\napplications, including Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Yandex. The malware also allows\nkeylogging and cryptocurrency theft using ClipBanker. PseudoManuscrypt uses the KCP\nprotocol to download additional plugins.\n\n**ColdStealer**\n\nColdStealer is used to steal multiple types of information, including crypto wallets, FTP\ncredentials, and credentials from browsers.\n\n**FormatLoader**\n\nFormatLoader uses hardcoded URLs as format strings. It is used to download an additional\nfile and infect a victim's machine.\n\n**CsdiMonetize**\n\nCsdiMonetize is an advertising platform typically used to install PUAs (potentially unwanted\napplications). It also drops trojans, such as Glupteba.\n\n**Disbuk**\n\nDisbuk, also known as Socelar, steals Facebook cookies from Chrome and Firefox, access\ntokens, account IDs, and Amazon cookies. It installs a malicious browser extension\nmasquerading as Google Translate.\n\n**Fabookie**\n\n\n-----\n\nFabookie targets Facebook ads and steals browser session cookies. It also uses Facebook\nGraph API Queries to harvest information about a user’s account, linked payment method,\nbalance, and friends.\n\n**DanaBot**\n\nDanaBot is a modular banking trojan. Functionalities include stealing information and\ninjecting fake forms to collect payment data. It can also give a threat actor full remote access\nto a machine using the VNC plugin.\n\n**Racealer**\n\nRacealer, also known as RaccoonStealer, is a relatively unsophisticated malware as a\nservice written in C/C++. More recent versions use Telegram to retrieve C2 information and\nmalware configurations.\n\n**Generic.ClipBanker**\n\nGeneric.ClipBanker is a clipboard hijacker. It monitors the victim machine for cryptocurrency\naddresses and replaces them with the threat actor’s cryptocurrency wallet address to\nintercept payments.\n\n**SgnitLoader**\n\nSgnitLoader is a trojan downloader written in C#.\n\n**ShortLoader**\n\nShortLoader is another trojan downloader.\n\n**Downloader.INNO**\n\nDownloader.INNO is an Inno Setup installer that utilizes Inno Download Plugin to download a\nfile from the C2. The downloaded file is related to the Satacom downloader family.\n\n**LgoogLoader**\n\nLgoogLoader is an installer that drops three files: a batch file, an AutoIt interpreter, and an\nAutoIt script. After downloading, it executes the batch file.\n\n**Downloader.Bitser**\n\n\n-----\n\nDownloader.Bitser is an NSIS installer that installs Lightning Media Player and runs\nbitsadmin to download additional files.\n\n**C-Joker**\n\nC-Joker is an Exodus wallet stealer.\n\n**PrivateLoader**\n\nPrivateLoader is a pay-per-install loader similar to LgoogLoader and SmokeLoader.\n\n**Satacom**\n\nSatacom, also known as LegionLoader, is a loader that uses anti-analysis methods borrowed\nfrom al-khazer.\n\n**GCleaner**\n\nGCleaner is a pay-per-install loader. It was previously distributed as Garbage Cleaner, which\nmimicked CCleaner. GCleaner is used to download PUAs such as Azorult, Vidar, Predator\nthe Thief, and others.\n\n**Vidar**\n\nVidar is an infostealer that employs password grabbing. It steals browser autofill information,\ncookies, saved payment information, browser history, coin wallets, and Telegram databases.\nIt can also take screenshots.\n\n**IOCs**\n\nPolySwarm has multiple samples of NullMixer.\n\n[f2ec0aaf1cd2359465bd42b1951d1c59267137ddba96c85f28c981d622ecf093b69a81971bd4](https://polyswarm.network/scan/results/file/f2ec0aaf1cd2359465bd42b1951d1c59267137ddba96c85f28c981d622ecf093)\n800d1737ef67ef47e5b6793723c1fd4b75dfbdddf8b28bd93dd5c91dec1cd5b97079481c76d5d\n597dde67b60c301ea900eab7db99776d52b465a\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can use the following CLI command to search for all NullMixer samples in our portal:\n\n**_$ polyswarm link list -f NullMixer_**\n\n**_Don’t have a PolySwarm account?
