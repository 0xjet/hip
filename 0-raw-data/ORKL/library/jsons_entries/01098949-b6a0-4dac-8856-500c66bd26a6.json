They are sometimes portrayed as wild and reckless, but as seen under\nour visibility, the group can be pragmatic, measured, and agile. Our previous post on their\n2017 activity stepped away from the previously covered headline buzz presenting their\nassociation with previously known political hacks and interest in Europe and the US, and\nexamines their under-reported ongoing activity in middle east, central asia, and now a shift in\ntargeting further east, including China, along with an overlap surprise. There is much\n[understated activity that can be clustered within this set and overlap in APT activity. Here, we](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/apt-advanced-persistent-threats/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\nexamine current deployment, code, cryptography, and targeting.\n\n\n-----\n\nEssentially, this examination finds the group maintains subdivisions of efforts in targeting,\ndevelopment, and coding. Comparisons to other modules quickly shows a delineation in\nother Sofacy efforts. SPLM, GAMEFISH, and Zebrocy delivery all maintain their own\nclusters, but frequently overlap later.\n\nBecause SPLM is their primary and selective second stage tool, SPLM deployment is of\nmuch interest. But Zebrocy efforts are in such high volume, that these modules need\nexamination as well.\n\n## SPLM/CHOPSTICK/XAgent Code\n\nSPLM, otherwise known as CHOPSTICK, or by the author(s) as “XAgent”, is described as\nSofacy’s signature second stage tool, selectively used for years against around the world.\nReally, many modified XAgent modules have been deployed over the years. Even the\nindividual Linux modules renamed as “Fysbis” backdoors released in 2016 were merely\nmodified and reduced portions of recompiled XAgent C/C++ codebase. Anyway,\nSPLM/CHOPSTICK has maintained various combinations of code, with some recognizable\nfunctionality listed here.\n\n**Source** **Modules** **Channels**\n\nModules Keylogger HTTP\n\nChannels RemoteShell FTP\n\nBoot FileSystem SMTP\n\nLibrary Launcher\n\nMainHandler CameraShot\n\nInjectApp\n\nScreenshot\n\nFileObserver\n\nPasswordFirefox\n\nInfoOS\n\nVersion 3 and early version 4 SPLM modules maintained keylogger, remoteshell, and\nfilestealer code all within the larger compiled backdoor, and executed each body of\nfunctionality from within that process memory space. Later v4 SPLM injected individual\nkeylogger, filestealer, and remoteshell modules into memory space. But for the most part,\ndeployed SPLM maintained the structure of earlier executable code. In 2018, we now see\n\n\n-----\n\nthem pushing individual and separate blobs of keylogger, filesystem, and remoteshell code\nthat never touch disk. The larger, 300kb+ SPLM backdoors deployed in 2016 and 2017 are\nnot observed any longer at targets in 2018. Instead, in-memory modules appear in isolation.\n\nIn addition to purely XAgent based code, we also observe zebrocy modules completely\nrecoded into powershell from .Net.\n\n## Code and Crypto Comparisons\n\nCurrent SPLM code maintains the unusual cipher hack that Sofacy began deploying in 2017\nto hide away configuration details. Comparisons with cipher design and implementations we\nsee in WhiteBear, earlier SPLM and Zebrocy modules tell a few things about design\ndecisions and culture. And when specific malware sets are selectively deployed, that may tell\nus something about how efforts are divided.\n\n**SPLM full backdoor and plugins crypto and strings v4**\n\n973ff7eb7a5b720c5f6aafe4cd0469d5\n\nSummary: SPLM is being carved up and delivered as memory-only chunks of compiled\ncode. We observe the “retranslator” code, or ProcessRetranslator.dll, currently being\ndelivered to systems without the presence of the previous, large, SPLM code and injection\ncapabilities. The smaller plugins deployed in 2018 now maintain the same dynamic\nencryption code as the large 330kb full SPLM backdoors seen in more widespread use in\n2017. Strings are well organized and concise.\n\nCode and strings example (decrypted from 2018 “ProcessRetranslator.dll” plugin):\n\nsuccess command not correct\n\nerror save parameters\n\nerror set parameters for channel, see full info\n\ncommand processing error\n\nnot correct command\n\ncommand loading func/net module error\n\ncommand unloading func/net module error\n\ncmd.exe\n\nRetranslator is now launched\n\nRetranslator is now stopped\n\nthe process is destroyed\n\none thread has died so the process is killed too\n\ncreate process failed on: (%s), error (%d)\n\nRetranslator is already running\n\nRetranslator is not running\n\nexit\n\ncommand is successful\n\ncommand is unsuccessful\n\n\n-----\n\n**SPLM crypto v3 (DNC hack)**\ncc9e6578a47182a941a478b276320e06\nSummary: This earlier SPLM variant found on the DNC network in 2016 still maintains the\ninternal name “splm.dll”, with only one export “init” that was called at runtime. The C++\nstructure of this 280kb+ dll is familiar SPLM/CHOPSTICK, but it maintains a completely\ndifferent cipher for decrypting configuration data and error messages, etc. The loop\nperforming the bulk of the work is less than 100 bytes, performing pointer arithmetic\nalongside a couple xor operations of a lower nibble against sequential bytes.\n\nHere, the cipher uses a modolo pointer arithmetic along with a decryption key per blob.\nReviewing all the older ciphers and newer EC based ciphers in openssl and elsewhere\nresults in no match.\n\n**WhiteBear code and strings**\nSummary: WhiteBear is a cluster of activity targeting foreign embassies and MFA\norganizations, starting in early 2016 and continued into early 2017. Our private GReAT report\non this activity pushed in February 2017, and a public report from another vendor described\nmuch of the same content almost seven months later as “Gayzer”. It appeared to be a\nparallel project to WhiteAtlas Turla, and maintained quirks like modular, well logged code\nwith an elegant, professional RSA and 3DES encryption implementation and high quality\ncode injection capabilities, but lots of immature and crude language and english mistakes.\nClearly, english and maturity was not the developers’ native language.\n\nWhile WhiteBear is Turla related, it is interesting to compare to other ongoing development\nstyles. Strings and code are crass.\n\nDebug and command strings\n\ni cunt waiting anymore #%d\nlights aint turnt off with #%d\nNot find process\nCMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_NO_CONNECT_TO_GAYZER\nCMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_TAKE_LAST_CONNECTION\nCMessageProcessingSystem::Send_TAKE_FIN\n\n\n-----\n\n**Zebrocy custom crypto**\nSummary: innovative .Net, AutoIT, Delphi, and powershell components are continually\nupdated and deployed to new and old targets. Cryptography ranges from built-in windows api\nto custom RC4-based ciphers. Strings and code are simple, innovative, and concise.\n\nCode:\n\n## Targeting Overlap and a Pivot to Asia\n\n\n-----\n\nNews headlines repeatedly trumpet Sofacy s foray into Western targets in the US and\nEurope, especially those connected with NATO. But these efforts only tell a portion of the\nSofacy story.\n\nDelineating groups and activity can be messy, and there appears to be overlap in targeting\nefforts across varying groups in central and east asia throughout 2017 and into 2018. Sofacy\nhas been heavily interested in military and foreign affairs organizations here, resulting in\nmultiple overlapped and competing targeting scenarios:\n\nMosquito Turla and Zebrocy clusters – Zebrocy clusters targeting diplomatic and\ncommercial organizations within Europe and Asia that match Mosquito targeting\nprofiling\nSPLM overlap with traditional Turla – often Turla precedes SPLM deployments\nSPLM overlap with Zebrocy – Zebrocy often precedes SPLM deployments\nSPLM overlap with Danti\n\nCurrently, Sofacy targets large air-defense related commercial organizations in China with\nSPLM, and moves Zebrocy focus across Armenia, Turkey, Kazahkstan, Tajikistan,\nAfghanistan, Mongolia, China, and Japan. A previous, removed, report from another vendor\nclaimed non-specific information about the groups’ interest in Chinese universities, but that\nreport has been removed – most likely detections were related to students’ and researchers’\nscanning known collected samples and any “incidents” remain unconfirmed and unknown.\nOn the other hand, this Chinese conglomerate designs and manufactures aerospace and air\ndefense technologies, among many other enterprises. And here, an interest in military\ntechnologies is certainly within Sofacy purview.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, even more interesting than the shift eastward and other targeting overlap, is that the\nspecific target system in China was previously a Grey Lambert target. The Sofacy modules\nat this system appeared to never touch disk, and resemble the Linux Fysbis code. Only one\nmaintained the Filesystem.dll code, while another maintained ProcessRetranslator.dll code.\nHowever, it is unusual that a full SPLM backdoor was not detected on this system, nor was\nany powershell loader script. Because the injection source remains unidentified on such a\nunique system, we might speculate on what is going on here:\n\n1. Sofacy attackers had recorded a previous Grey Lambert remote session and replayed\n\nthe communication after discovering this host, essentially compromising the Grey\nLambert module on the system to gain access and later injecting SPLM modules\n2. Grey Lambert attackers inserted false flag and reduced SPLM modules\n3. a new and unrecognized, full variant of SPLM attempted to inject module code into\n\nmemory and deleted itself\n4. an unknown new powershell script or legitimate but vulnerable web app was exploited\n\nto load and execute this unusual SPLM code\n\nIn all likelihood, the last option is accurate.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSofacy is such a large, active group that appears to maintain multiple sub-groups and efforts\nthat all fit under the Sofacy “umbrella”. Sometimes, they share infrastructure, but more often\nthey do not share infrastructure and appear to compete for access within targets. Either way,\nthe group’s consistent activity throughout central and eastern asia seems to be poorly\nrepresented in the public discussion.\n\nSPLM did not change in substantial ways for several years, and now it is being split up and\nused for just functional modules. And much of the malware being deployed by Sofacy is\nquickly changed from C/C++ to .Net to powershell. Other open source and semi-legitimate\npen-testing tools like nbtscan and powercat are being used for mapping available resources\nand lateral movement as well. It is easy to expect deliberate changes within this group in\n2018, with even more .Net, Delphi, and powershell ports of various tools appearing at\nSofacy targets throughout the year.\n\n## Technical Appendix\n\nEarly 2018 Reference Set\nSPLM\n452ed4c80c1d20d111a1dbbd99d649d5\n\nZEBROCY\nefd8a516820c44ddbf4cc8ed7f30df9c\nff0e4f31a6b18b676b9518d4a748fed1\n\n\n-----\n\nGAMEFISH\nbd3e9f7e65e18bb9a7c4ff8a8aa3a784\n\nGREY LAMBERT\n86146d38b738d5bfaff7e85a23dcc53e\n\nGREYWARE/PEN-TESTING NBTSCAN\nf01a9a2d1e31332ed36c1a4d2839f412\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Sofacy](https://securelist.com/tag/sofacy/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nMasha and these Bears\n\nYour email address will not be published.
