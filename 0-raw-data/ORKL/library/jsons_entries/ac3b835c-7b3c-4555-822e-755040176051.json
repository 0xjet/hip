The activity and indicators in this report were detailed in several intelligence reports for Recorded\nFuture clients between February and June 2023.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group has continued to observe Russian state actors increasing efforts to\nconceal command-and-control network traffic via legitimate internet services (LIS) and to diversify the\nnumber of services being misused in support of this effort. BlueBravo is a threat group tracked by Insikt\nGroup whose activity overlaps with that of the Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) groups\ntracked as [APT29 and Midnight Blizzard. APT29 and Midnight Blizzard operations have been](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc2452-merged-into-apt29) [previously](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/)\n[attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), an organization responsible for foreign](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/24/new-activity-from-russian-actor-nobelium/)\nespionage, active measures, and electronic surveillance.\n\nIn January 2023, we released a public [report](https://www.recordedfuture.com/bluebravo-uses-ambassador-lure-deploy-graphicalneutrino-malware) describing how BlueBravo employed a theme suggestive\nof an ambassador’s schedule in order to deliver malware we dubbed GraphicalNeutrino. In this activity\nwe found that the group employed several consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs): the\nuse of compromised infrastructure, the employment of related known malware families, the periodic use\nof third-party services for command-and-control (C2), and the reuse of general themes for lures.\n\nIn addition to the identified TTPs, we also analyzed a novel malware variant used by BlueBravo, tracked\nby Insikt Group as GraphicalProton. GraphicalProton acts as a loader and, much like previously\ndescribed samples of GraphicalNeutrino, is staged within an ISO or ZIP file and relies on the newly\nidentified compromised domains for delivery to targeted hosts. Unlike GraphicalNeutrino, which\nemployed note-taking web application Notion for C2, the newly identified GraphicalProton sample uses\nMicrosoft's OneDrive for C2 communication. The misuse of LIS by BlueBravo is a continuation of its\nprevious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as it has employed multiple online services such\nas Trello, Firebase, and Dropbox in an attempt to evade detection. As a result, it is imperative for\nnetwork defenders to be aware of the possibility of the misuse of these services within their enterprise\nand to recognize instances in which they may be used in similar efforts to exfiltrate information.\n\nAlthough we do not have direct visibility into the targeted entities, we can infer from the lure themes\nand linguistic artifacts that the Russian government is likely prioritizing cyber-espionage efforts against\ngovernment sector entities in Europe, at present. The need for information from these sectors and\nregions is likely driven by the Russian government’s need for strategic data to facilitate its long-term\nsurvival during and after the war in Ukraine.\n\nBased on observed trends associated with malware and infrastructure development throughout the first\nhalf of 2023, we assess that it is likely BlueBravo will adapt and iterate upon existing malware families\nto develop new variants and will continue to leverage third-party services as necessary to obfuscate C2\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunications. The use of legitimate website compromise as one approach to malware delivery via\nHTML smuggling, as well as the use of PHP code for delivery, are recently observed approaches to the\ninfection chain.\n\nDue to how adaptive and evolving BlueBravo has been since 2022, tracking the group must also be an\nadaptive and evolving process and requires that the organizations most likely to be its victims invest\nadditional time and resources. This includes those within the government sector and other\norganizations that Russian state actors are likely to deem of interest in furthering their geopolitical\ninterests surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Defenders should detect, block, and hunt for the\nindicators and behaviors referenced in connection with BlueBravo reporting via the Recorded Future®\nIntelligence Cloud in network monitoring, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and any associated\nperimeter security appliances.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - Insikt Group has identified recent samples of the BlueBravo custom malware GraphicalNeutrino\nas well as a new strain of malware with similar characteristics that we call GraphicalProton.\n\n  - This activity likely represents efforts by BlueBravo operators to diversify their tooling, C2\ninfrastructure, and portfolio of legitimate services they abuse in order to successfully target\norganizations of interest to Russian state actors.\n\n  - BlueBravo is likely to continue developing infrastructure and compromising vulnerable websites\nto facilitate the deployment of subsequent strains of malware including GraphicalNeutrino (aka\nSnowyAmber), GraphicalProton, and QuarterRig.\n\n  - The lure pages we observed in this activity continue to reveal BlueBravo’s interest in targeting\npersonnel assigned to diplomatic or foreign policy institutions throughout Eastern Europe.\n\n  - As the war in Ukraine continues, it is almost certain that BlueBravo will continue to consider\ngovernment and diplomatic institutions high-value targets for the foreseeable future. It is likely\nthat BlueBravo, and by extension the Russian intelligence consumers reliant on the data\nBlueBravo provides, views these organizations as providing strategic insight into the\ndecision-making process of governments allied with Ukraine.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\n\nThe BlueBravo threat activity that Insikt Group has identified in H1 2023 consists of the use of\ncompromised and actor-controlled domains to deploy at least 3 custom tools — QuarterRig,\nGraphicalNeutrino, and GraphicalProton. QuarterRig was first described and named by Poland’s\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT-PL); GraphicalNeutrino (tracked by CERT-PL as\nSnowyAmber) and GraphicalProton were first described and named publicly by Recorded Future.\n\n  - **GraphicalNeutrino: Insikt Group initially described GraphicalNeutrino malware in public** [reporting](https://www.recordedfuture.com/bluebravo-uses-ambassador-lure-deploy-graphicalneutrino-malware)\non January 27, 2023. This malware acts as a loader with basic C2 functionality and implements\nnumerous anti-analysis techniques including API unhooking, dynamically resolving APIs, string\nencryption, and sandbox evasion. It exploits the API for the United States (US)-based, business\nautomation service Notion for C2 communications. Additionally, it uses Notion’s database feature\nto store victim information and stage payloads for download.\n\n  - **[QuarterRig: On April 14, 2023, CERT-PL released a comprehensive analysis](https://www.gov.pl/attachment/6f51bb1a-3ad2-461c-a16d-408915a56f77)** of QuarterRig, a\nnewly discovered malware family used by BlueBravo that was first identified in March 2023.\nQuarterRig is deployed via spearphishing emails containing attachments with malicious links.\nWhen victims click on these links, they are redirected to compromised websites that use scripts\nor HTML smuggling techniques to load QuarterRig onto the victim's computer. The QuarterRig\nmalware functions as a loader used to deliver a more advanced second-stage payload;\nCERT-PL's analysis indicates that all the examined samples of QuarterRig delivered Cobalt Strike\nBeacon payloads as their second-stage payload.\n\n  - **GraphicalProton: In May 2023, Insikt Group first described the GraphicalProton malware for**\nclients. GraphicalProton acts as a loader, and, much like previously described samples of\nGraphicalNeutrino, is staged within an ISO or ZIP file and relies on the newly identified\ncompromised domains for delivery to targeted hosts. Unlike some previously analyzed samples\nof GraphicalNeutrino that employed Notion for C2, we observed that the newly identified\nGraphicalProton samples use Microsoft OneDrive instead.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Overview of BlueBravo attack flow (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nThis report details Recorded Future’s tracking of BlueBravo’s use of compromised infrastructure to\ndeliver these 3 custom malware families.\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\n#### Infrastructure Analysis\n\n\n**QuarterRig Activity: March to May 2023**\n\n\nThrough analyzing known BlueBravo C2 infrastructure and related file artifacts, we identified multiple\nadditional compromised domains that we assess are almost certainly being used by the threat group to\ndeliver QuarterRig. One of the domains we observed, sylvio[.]com[.]br, was also publicly [identified](https://www.gov.pl/web/baza-wiedzy/espionage-campaign-linked-to-russian-intelligence-services) by\nCERT-PL in their analysis of the QuarterRig malware family.\n\n|Domain|Related Sample|Filename|\n|---|---|---|\n|te-as[.]no|22b037f0a42579b45530bed196dd2b47fd4d4dffb8daa273858128793 2794954|Note[.]iso|\n|remcolours[.]com|c71ec48a59631bfa3f33383c1f25719e95e5a80936d913ab3bfe2feb172 c1c5e|Note[.]zip|\n|sylvio[.]com[.]br|b84d6a12bb1756b69791e725b0e3d7a962888b31a8188de225805717c 299c086|Note[.]iso|\n\n\n**Table 1: Compromised BlueBravo infrastructure for delivery of QuarterRig (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\nOn April 12, 2023, Insikt Group identified the domain te-as[.]no, which was hosted on the IP address\n51.75.154[.]169 at the time of analysis, delivering a malicious ISO file (further described in the Malware\n**Analysis section of this report) named “Note.iso” (SHA256**\n22b037f0a42579b45530bed196dd2b47fd4d4dffb8daa2738581287932794954) via the web page\nhxxps://te-as[.]no/wine[.]php. This use of a PHP file to deliver the malware was a departure from\nprevious BlueBravo use of HTML files on compromised infrastructure.\n\nInsikt Group also identified a lure document which was nearly identical to a lure described in CERT-PL's\noriginal reporting, which included a link to another QuarterRig sample found at\nhxxps://sylvio.com[.]br/form.php. Both lure documents present themselves as invitations to a\nwine-tasting event on behalf of the Embassy of the Czech Republic. The only differences between the\n2 documents are the event dates, the signing date, and the URIs used for downloading additional\ninformation. A side-by-side comparison of each lure document is provided in Figure 2 below. The use of\nPHP web pages for malware delivery is in line with previous BlueBravo activity identified by Insikt Group\nin February 2023.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n|Date Range|Domain|IP Address|\n|---|---|---|\n|3/21/2023 to 5/21/2023|mightystake[.]com|176.10.111[.]77|\n|3/14/2023 to 5/22/2023|sharpledge[.]com|51.75.210[.]218|\n|4/17/2023 to 5/18/2023|fondoftravel[.]com|185.174.101[.]243|\n\n\n**Table 2: BlueBravo-controlled QuarterRig C2s for network communication (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**QuarterRig Activity: May to June 2023**\n\n\nOn May 22, 2023, Insikt Group [identified](https://urlscan.io/result/34ec7bb6-c414-4397-98d6-70cdb5ae4b25/) another compromised domain, easym6[.]com, which hosted a\nPHP file that delivered a QuarterRig sample that beacons to actor-controlled infrastructure. Users\nredirected to the URL hxxps://easym6[.]com/Information.php would download a ZIP file titled\nInformation.zip file (SHA256\nb422ba73f389ae5ef9411cf4484c840c7c82f2731c6324db0b24b6f87ce8477d). In addition to\nQuarterRig, Information.zip includes 3 other files essential to the execution and function of the malware.\n[URLScan shows](https://urlscan.io/result/34ec7bb6-c414-4397-98d6-70cdb5ae4b25/) that this domain, and specifically the identified URL, was delivering the Information.zip\nfile via Information.php.\n\nThe most recent QuarterRig sample identified by Insikt Group in connection with this research was in\nJune 2023. The sample was discovered in an ISO file titled “Specification.iso” (SHA256:\n55d01a923ab4fb73990699b0e53dd0e57cab0549049030a43029cdaec4dfea98). Insikt Group\nanalyzed the sample and identified the C2 domain as reidao[.]com, which was hosted on the IP address\n51.77.38[.]127 at the time of analysis.\n\n**GraphicalProton Activity: March to May 2023**\n\n##### resetlocations[.]com\n\n[On May 4, 2023, Insikt Group identified the domain resetlocations[.]com, hosted on the IP address](https://urlscan.io/result/effd52c2-799e-46ff-89aa-32ede1d83e96)\n192.254.235[.]191, delivering the malicious ISO file “bmw.iso” (SHA256:\n79a1402bc77aa2702dc5dca660ca0d1bf08a2923e0a1018da70e7d7c31d9417f) via the webpage\nresetlocations[.]com/bmw.htm. As in previous GraphicalNeutrino reporting, it is believed that BlueBravo\ncompromised the website in order to host a sample of GraphicalProton. Contained within the HTML of\nthe webpage is this obfuscated ISO file that is deployed via HTML smuggling; the ISO file is set to\nauto-download when the website is visited. On May 8, 2023, we observed 2 .docx files uploaded to a\nmalware repository that serve as lure documents for the URL referenced as\nresetlocations[.]com/bmw[.]htm. We observed that the HTML content on resetlocations[.]com (Figure\n**3) checks the victim’s user agent string to determine whether the bmw.iso payload should be**\ndownloaded, which differs from previous iterations of threat group activity from [earlier](https://www.recordedfuture.com/bluebravo-uses-ambassador-lure-deploy-graphicalneutrino-malware) in 2023 (Figure\n**4) that would download the payload regardless.**\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nThe prior targeting related to the misuse of the BMW brand is likely suggestive of wider targeting of\nindividuals who may have an interest in the type of vehicle or industry.

The DLL employs multiple\nanti-analysis techniques including encrypted strings, dynamic API resolution, and stack strings. After\ndecrypting API strings, it spawns a new thread that uses an RC4 stream cipher with a hardcoded key to\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen a victim tries to open any of the LNK files, it triggers the execution of the command cmd /c\n```\nstart .$Recycle.Bin\\windoc.exe && \".$Recycle.Bin\\bmw[X].png\". This command is used\n\n```\nto launch windoc.exe and open a PNG file corresponding to the number of the LNK file opened.\nWindoc.exe serves as the initial execution point for the malware, while the PNG file acts as a decoy to\ndivert attention away from the malware as it begins its execution within the Windoc.exe process.\n\nWindoc.exe is a benign copy of the Microsoft Word application that is used to load\nAppIsvSubsystems64.dll via DLL search order hijacking. AppIsvSubsystems64.dll serves as a loader to\nexecute GraphicalProton on the victim's machine, and employs several anti-analysis and\nanti-debugging techniques including:\n\n  - Verifying if the victim's system has more than 1 processor\n\n  - Checking if the system’s RAM is greater than 1,024 MB\n\n  - Timing-checks via sleep calls\n\n  - Checking for debuggers by calling ntQueryObject on the current process and looking for a\n[“DebugObject” (similar to the technique shown here)](https://gist.github.com/soxfmr/16c495d6e4ad99e9e46f5bfd558d152f)\n\n  - Dynamically resolving syscalls and Windows API functions\n\n  - Obfuscating control flow by manipulating the RIP register value via direct syscalls to\nzwGetContextThread and zwSetContextThread\n\n  - Using custom exception handlers and generating exceptions to redirect control flow\n\nAfter passing anti-analysis checks, the loader reads encrypted shellcode from the file ojg2.px and\ndecrypts its contents using an xor cipher with a rotating key. It then scans running processes to locate a\nsuitable 64-bit process for injecting shellcode into. Once a suitable process is identified, the loader\nperforms process injection in a similar manner as the [NtCreateSection + NtMapViewOfSection](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/ntcreatesection-+-ntmapviewofsection-code-injection)\ndescribed by ired.team. One deviation from the ired.team article is that the shellcode is executed via a\n[new thread with the THREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_HIDE_FROM_DEBUGGER](https://ntquery.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/anti-debug-ntcreatethreadex/) flag set, which is used as an\nadditional anti-analysis technique to prevent the thread from being visible to debuggers attached to its\nprocess.\n\nIn the remote process, the shellcode resolves APIs and then unhooks several modules including\nkernel32, ntdll, shell32, oleaut32, mscoree, and combase. Afterwards, it utilizes the\n[RtlDecompressBuffer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-rtldecompressbuffer) Windows API function to decompress an embedded PE file that is compressed\nusing [LZNT1. This decompressed PE file is the GraphicalProton payload that is then loaded into the](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-xca/5655f4a3-6ba4-489b-959f-e1f407c52f15)\nsame process, and a new thread is started to execute its start routine.\n\nGraphicalProton unhooks all DLL modules loaded by the process. It then attempts to renew an access\ntoken for Microsoft OneDrive by sending an HTTP request to login.microsoftonline[.]com with the\n[Microsoft Graph permissions files.readwrite.all and offline_access.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference)\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8: Refresh token request made by GraphicalProton (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nAfter obtaining a new token, a wordlist is used to create a randomly named directory under the\nOneDrive account’s App\\Teams_Test folder. Next, 2 randomly named subdirectories are created to\ncontain C2 communications to and from the victim. GraphicalProton then gathers the victim’s system\ninformation — including their username, computer name, Windows version, network connections, and a\nlist of running processes — by running the following commands:\n\n  - `cmd.exe /C \"chcp 65001 > NUL & whoami\"`\n\n  - `cmd.exe /C \"chcp 65001 > NUL & wmic datafile where`\n```\n   Name=\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntoskrnl.exe\" get Version”\n\n```\n  - `cmd.exe /C \"chcp 65001 > NUL & netstat -a\"`\n\n  - `cmd.exe /C \"chcp 65001 > NUL & tasklist\"`\n\n[The output of these commands are encrypted using a Chaskey](https://mouha.be/chaskey/) cipher in CTR mode. Each byte of the\nciphertext is encoded as binary represented by hex bytes corresponding to individual bits (0x00 and\n0x01) and stored within a BMP file that is subsequently uploaded to 1 of the victim’s previously created\nOneDrive subdirectories.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Chaskey encryption algorithm (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nNext, the malware periodically polls the OneDrive account for new files in the App\\Teams_Test folder.\nWhen one is found, it is downloaded, decoded, and decrypted. The malware expects the file to be in a\nBMP file format using the same binary encoding and Chaskey cipher encryption as the initial C2\ncheck-in. The payload of the BMP file is capable of requesting the malware to read or write files, inject\nshellcode into remote processes, or run commands via cmd.exe. Results and log messages from the C2\nrequest are stored in a new encrypted and encoded BMP file that is uploaded back to the OneDrive\naccount (to the same victim subdirectory into which the initial BMP was uploaded).\n\nThe malware then continues communicating with its C2 by periodically polling the description data\nstored on the victim’s OneDrive folder. This field is updated throughout the malware’s execution using\nshort codes to indicate what the malware is doing, and can also be updated by the malware operators\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nto request certain functionality. For example, if the value ''mw'' is added to the description, then\nGraphicalProton will look for a new BMP communication in the victim’s second subdirectory. If one is\npresent, then GraphicalProton will download, decode, and decrypt it in the same manner as previously\ndescribed and execute the BMP payload’s requested instructions.\n\nAside from its support for OneDrive, GraphicalProton also contains code, an API key and secret, and a\nrefresh token to integrate with DropBox as an alternative C2 backend. Many techniques from\nGraphicalProton coincide with a prior analysis [report](https://github.com/Dump-GUY/Malware-analysis-and-Reverse-engineering/blob/main/APT29_C2-Client_Dropbox_Loader/APT29-DropboxLoader_analysis.md) conducted by GitHub user Dump-GUY on an\nAPT29 DropBox loader. Both samples share similarities in their utilization of dynamically resolved\nsyscalls, employing online storage providers like DropBox for C2 communications, and camouflaging C2\ncommunications as benign files (MP3 in the earlier analysis and BMP in the more recent samples). This\noverlap suggests that GraphicalProton represents a continuation of the previously analyzed malware\nfamily, showcasing ongoing development efforts by BlueBravo operators.\n\nInsikt Group has created YARA rules to assist defenders in monitoring for GraphicalProton samples (see\n**Appendix C).**\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\nDefenders should conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate activity associated with\nBlueBravo:\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any\nnetwork defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking\nconnection attempts to and from — the external domains listed in Appendix A.\n\n  - Recorded Future proactively detects malicious server configurations and provides means to\nblock them in the Command and Control Security Control Feed. The Command and Control feed\nincludes tools used by BlueBravo and other Russian state-sponsored threat activity groups.\nRecorded Future clients should alert on and block these C2 servers to allow for detection and\nremediation of active intrusions.\n\n  - [Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI), Third-Party Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/threat-intelligence)\n[modules users can monitor real-time output from network intelligence analytics to identify](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nsuspected targeted intrusion activity involving your organization or key vendors and partners.\n\n  - Use the YARA rule provided in Appendix C to search your network for potential QuarterRig,\nGraphicalNeutrino, and/or GraphicalProton infections.\n\n  - [Implement an application allow-list policy](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/create-an-application-whitelist-policy-in-windows/) on Windows hosts, and enable AppArmor/SELinux on\nLinux-based hosts.\n\n## Outlook\n\nBased on BlueBravo’s ongoing adaptation of existing malware families, as well as a willingness to evolve\nthe malware delivery mechanism over time, we assess BlueBravo to be a highly capable actor. The\ngroup has routinely updated its TTPs to blend into legitimate network traffic and effectively evade\ndetection. Defenders should detect, block, and hunt for the indicators and behaviors referenced in\nconnection with BlueBravo reporting via the Recorded Future® Intelligence Cloud in network monitoring,\nintrusion detection systems, firewalls, and any associated perimeter security appliances.\n\nWe assess that as the war in Ukraine continues, it is almost certain BlueBravo will continue to consider\ngovernment and diplomatic institutions high-value targets, with a likely focus on entities in Europe or\nthose who are aligned with Ukraine. As such, we believe it is likely these entities will continue to be\ncentral in BlueBravo’s targeting calculus for the foreseeable future. BlueBravo’s targeting of these\nentities highlights their importance to decision-makers in military and strategic leadership positions in\nthe Russian government.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n```\nCompromised Domains Associated with BlueBravo Activity:\nte-as[.]no\neasym6[.]com\nremcolours[.]com\nsimplesalsamix[.]com\nsylvio[.]com[.]br\nreidao[.]com\nmightystake[.]com\nsharpledge[.]com\nfondoftravel[.]com\nURLs Associated with BlueBravo Activity:\nte-as[.]no/wine[.]php\neasym6[.]com/Information.php\nreidao[.]com/dashboard.php\nresetlocations[.]com/bmw.htm\nsimplesalsamix[.]com/e-yazi.html\nsylvio.com[.]br/form.php\nmightystake[.]com/sponsorship.php\nsharpledge[.]com/login.php\nfondoftravel[.]com/contact.php\nFiles:\n9da5339a5a7519b8b639418ea34c9a95f11892732036278b14dbbf4810fec7a3 AppvIsvSubsystems64.dll\n6c55195f025fb895f9d0ec3edbf58bc0aa46c43eeb246cfb88eef1ae051171b3 Note.exe\n22b037f0a42579b45530bed196dd2b47fd4d4dffb8daa2738581287932794954 Note.iso\ned5c3800cf9eb3d76e5bab079c7f8f3e0748935f0696ce0898f8bd421c3c306f Bdcmetadataresource.xsd\nb84d6a12bb1756b69791e725b0e3d7a962888b31a8188de225805717c299c086 Note.iso\naff3d7f9ebfdbe69c65b8441a911b539b344f2708e5cef498f10e13290e90c91 AppvIsvSubsystems64.dll\n9f2b400439e610577a6bbc1f83849c6108689d99a9fe7bdd1c74e4dfffadde14 Bdcmetadataresource.xsd\nc71ec48a59631bfa3f33383c1f25719e95e5a80936d913ab3bfe2feb172c1c5e Note.zip\n385973e7777081c81cfe236fcc8b3ebf5e4ae04f16030d525535f6cfe38cae7b AppvIsvSubsystems64.dll\nbecbd20a19bab555b92d471b30b8159dfa709e9bc417e5d42d72c94546d9e61c Schema.inf\n79a1402bc77aa2702dc5dca660ca0d1bf08a2923e0a1018da70e7d7c31d9417f bmw.iso\n640a08b52623cd8702de066f1f9a6923b18283fc2656137cd9c584da1e07775c bmw1.png.lnk\n6f37579d445639c7dfebb4927fe7f6ea70d25d1127f9d9b5078f8ccd4da36127 bmw2.png.lnk\n0e22e6a1dc529008d62287cfddaed53c7f4cc698feec144f00c92594dc76d036 bmw3.png.lnk\n02ce47bd766f7489c6326c30351eb9b365f9997de1b2f92924d130fa07e0d82c bmw4.png.lnk\nc5209127e65b0465c8a707ca127b067aa8756c1138bd0d3636f71bfbe8fd9bda bmw5.png.lnk\ne22bc75bb87e19554cd0f98c98b22a07368c2b23adacc41fe2cd68c20957d60a bmw6.png.lnk\n2589700d01c8a60a4f2d8188e31712821c7085a4715785e2871ac517c81477e3 bmw7.png.lnk\n\n```\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK Techniques|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|\n|Resource Development: Compromise Infrastructure|T1584|\n|Execution: User Execution: Malicious File|T1204.002|\n|Persistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder|T1547.001|\n|Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information: HTML Smuggling|T1027.006|\n|Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information: Dynamic API Resolution|T1027.007|\n|Defense Evasion: Masquerading: Right-to-Left Override|T1036.002|\n|Defense Evasion: Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location|T1036.005|\n|Defense Evasion: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information|T1140|\n|Defense Evasion: Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking|T1574.001|\n|Defense Evasion: Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading|T1574.002|\n|Defense Evasion: Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools|T1562.001|\n|Discovery: System Owner/User Discovery|T1033|\n|Discovery: System Information Discovery|T1082|\n|Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols|T1071.001|\n|Command and Control: Web Service: Bidirectional Communication|T1102.002|\n|Command and Control: Ingress Tool Transfer|T1105|\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix C — GraphicalProton YARA Rules\n\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nInsikt Group is Recorded Future’s threat research division, comprising analysts and\nsecurity researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and intelligence\nagency experience.
