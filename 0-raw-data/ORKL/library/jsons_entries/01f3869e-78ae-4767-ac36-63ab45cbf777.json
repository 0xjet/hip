I've had security warnings before, but this one just came to me hours after a\n[similar Google alert to my @theatlantic colleague @JamesFallows. Both of us already](https://twitter.com/TheAtlantic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[use Advanced Protection. https://t.co/UptU2rrVIr](https://t.co/UptU2rrVIr) [pic.twitter.com/lk2JTrBLh5](https://t.co/lk2JTrBLh5)\n\n[— Barton Gellman (@bartongellman) October 7, 2021](https://twitter.com/bartongellman/status/1446155364001587207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n“This particular campaign comprised 86% of the batch of warnings we sent for this month,”\nHuntley added.\n\n\n-----\n\nFirstly these warnings indicate targeting NOT compromise. If we are warning you there s a\n[very high chance we blocked,” Huntley said in a separate Twitter thread.](https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1446103822250565638)\n\n“If you are an activist/journalist/government official or work in NatSec, this warning honestly\nshouldn’t be a surprise.\n\n“At some point, some government-backed entity probably will try to send you something,” he\nadded while urging users to review account security settings,” he added.\n\nHuntley, who leads the TAG team, a Google security division focused on hunting apex threat\nactors, said they blocked all the emails sent by the APT28 group in this campaign.\n\nTracked as APT28, but also more commonly known as Fancy Bear, the FBI and NSA linked\nthis group earlier this summer to Russia’s military intelligence apparatus—and in particular to\nthe Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special\n**Service Center (GTsSS), military unit 26165.**\n\nAPT28 has been one of the most active threat actors over the past decade, and the group\nhas often relied on spear-phishing emails to go after targets of interest. Their aim is to\nbreach inboxes, get access to sensitive documents and communications, and then pivot to\nother individuals or internal networks.\n\n“If you received a warning or are a high-risk user, journalist, politician, celebrity, or CEO, we\n[recommend you enroll in the Advanced Protection Program for work and personal emails,”](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)\nHuntley said in an email, promoting a Google program meant to add and activate additional\nsecurity protections to high-risk accounts.\n\nThe warnings sent out this week are not a new Gmail feature. Google has been sending\n[alerts about attacks carried out by state-sponsored entities since 2012.](https://security.googleblog.com/2012/06/security-warnings-for-suspected-state.html)\n\nTags\n\n[APT28](https://therecord.media/tag/apt28/)\n[Fancy Bear](https://therecord.media/tag/fancy-bear/)\n[Gmail](https://therecord.media/tag/gmail/)\n[Google](https://therecord.media/tag/google/)\n[Google TAG](https://therecord.media/tag/google-tag/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[phishing](https://therecord.media/tag/phishing/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
