These are\nknown to be some of the most advanced, sophisticated and notorious APT groups out there – and\nnot in vain. These Russian-attributed actors are part of a bigger picture in which Russia is one of\nthe strongest powers in the cyber warfare today. Their advanced tools, unique approaches, and\nsolid infrastructures suggest enormous and complicated operations that involve different military\nand government entities inside Russia.\n\nRussia is known to conduct a wide range of cyber espionage and sabotage operations for the last\n[three decades. Beginning with the first publicly known attacks by Moonlight Maze, in 1996, going](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180251/Penquins_Moonlit_Maze_PDF_eng.pdf)\n[through the Pentagon breach in 2008, Blacking out Kyiv in 2016, Hacking the US Elections in](https://web.archive.org/web/20090221124901/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/28/nation/na-cyberattack28)\n2016, and up to some of the largest most infamous cyberattacks in history – targeting a whole\ncountry with NotPetya ransomware.\n\nIndeed, numerous Russian operations and malware families were publicly exposed by different\n[security vendors and intelligence organizations such as the FBI and the Estonian Foreign](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf)\nIntelligence Services. While all of these shed light on specific Russian actors or operations, the\nbigger picture remains hazy.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fog behind these complicated operations made us realize that while we know a lot about\nsingle actors, we are short of seeing a whole ecosystem with actor interaction (or lack thereof)\nand particular TTPs that can be viewed in a larger scope. We decided to know more and to look\nat things from a broader perspective. This led us to gather, classify and analyze thousands of\nRussian APT malware samples in order to find connections – not only between samples but also\nbetween different families and actors.\n\nDuring this research, we analyzed approximately 2,000 samples that were attributed to Russia\nand found 22,000 connections between the samples and 3.85 million non-unique pieces of code\nthat were shared. We classified these samples into 60 families and 200 different modules.\n\n## key findings ключевые результаты\n\nThis research is the first and the most comprehensive of its kind.\n\nFor the first time, thousands of samples were gathered, classified and analyzed in\norder to map connections between different cyber espionage organizations of a\nsuperpower country.\nIn most cases, the Russian actors do not share code with one another.\n\nWhile each actor does reuse its code in different operations and between different\nmalware families, there is no single tool, library or framework that is shared between\ndifferent actors.\nEvery actor or organization under the Russain APT umbrella has its own dedicated\nmalware development teams, working for years in parallel on similar malware toolkits and\nframeworks. Knowing that a lot of these toolkits serve the same purpose, it is possible to\nspot redundancy in this parallel activity.\nThese findings may suggest that Russia is investing a lot of effort into its operational\nsecurity.\n\nBy avoiding different organizations re-using the same tools on a wide range of\ntargets, they overcome the risk that one compromised operation will expose other\nactive operations.\nWe were able to verify previously reported connections between different families,\nsupporting it with code similarity analysis as evidence.\nWe are releasing several tools to be used by the research community\n\n[An interactive map of connections between dozens of Russian APT families and their](https://apt-ecosystem.com/russia/map/)\ncomponents\n[A signature-based tool to scan a host or a file against the most commonly re-used](https://apt-ecosystem.com/russia/detector)\npieces of code by the Russian APTs\n\n**For the complete list of findings and their meaning, please refer to the extended results**\n**section.**\n\n## getting started начинаем\n\nOur journey into this complex ecosystem began, as any thorough research, with a question. To be\nhonest, it wasn’t a single question, but many of them –\n\n_What information is already available publicly? What (if any) previous research of this type been_\n_conducted before? Who are the actors in the Russian APT Ecosystem? What are the malware_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis led us to a deep background reading of public information that was shared by other\nresearchers, vendors, and governments. Without the previous research conducted by these\npeople, and without this information we would’ve been lost, so this is the time to say thank you.\n\nAfter days of reading background materials and publications, it was clearer to us how we should\nproceed. To put it simply, we split the research into four steps:\n\n1. Gathering samples\n2. Classifying the samples\n3. Find code similarities between the samples\n4. Analyze the found connections\n\nIn the chapters below, we will try to explain each of these steps. We will describe what we have\ndone, how we did it and what problems we encountered. If you are not interested in the technical\naspects of the research and want to jump straight to the detailed results – click here.\n\n## gathering samples сбор образцов\n\nThe first step was to gather samples that we know that were attributed to malware families that\nare associated with official Russian actors. We began by listing the names of the actors and\nfamilies we read about in the background reading. We searched for technical reports that were\npublished about these names and extracted potentially-valuable Indication of Compromise from\nthem. IOCs are usually posted at the bottom of technical analysis reports and used by\nresearchers as a way to share hashes of the discussed malware samples. This information can\nlater be used by other researchers, vendors and SOC teams.\n\nWe then downloaded these samples from VirusTotal and from our internal databases and\ngathered them all together. Overall, we began with approximately 2,500 unique samples.\n\n## classifying классификация\n\nWhen we find code similarities between two or more samples, we basically know that a sample\nfile A shares a mutual code with another sample file – B. This alone is not enough for us, because\nwe need to know what are these A and B – are they variants or modules of the same family; do\nthey belong to the same actor; or most important – are these samples part of different families,\nwritten by different actors. In order to do this, we need to have a clear understanding of the\nascription of each sample. When taking it into practice, we tried to figure out the following\ninformation about each and every sample we gathered:\n\n**Actor – Which Russian APT actor is known or probable to have written this malware**\n**(Turla, Sofacy, GreyEnergy, …)**\n**Family – What is the common family name that is associated with this malware**\n**Module – Many malware families are built in a modular way in which a certain**\n**malware can load different payloads embedded in it or downloaded from a Command**\n**and Control server. When possible, we wanted to know whether the sample we have**\n**is a Keylogger module, a communication module, an injection module or anything**\n**else.**\n**Version – Some malware have a clear version stamp embedded in them. We wanted to be**\nable to differentiate between earlier and recent versions as well as versions that were\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough on the surface it looks easy, classifying turned out to be one of the most complicated\nparts of this research.\n\nStarting with this frustrating fact – there is no naming standardization for malware and threat\nactors in the infosec industry. Every Russian APT actor and every malware family have more than\na few names given to them by different Vendors, researchers, and intelligence institutions; Some\nnames will be used by different vendors to describe different families; Some malware families\nwould be described with different names by the same vendor; Other malware families simply do\nnot have a clear name. These issues and more, made us face one of the most painful drawbacks\nof classification and required us to be very careful when we classify a specific piece of malware to\na family and an actor.\n\n## code similarities сходство кода\n\nOnce we finished collecting and classifying all of the Russian APT samples, we began to cluster\nthem based on the shared unique and malicious code between the different samples. Using\nIntezer’s Genetic Malware Analysis technology, we automatically disassembled and dissected\neach binary file into thousands of small pieces of assembly code, also referred to as “genes”.\nThen, for each and every gene, we checked in which software/malware it was seen previously, by\nreferencing Intezer’s code genome database. This code genome database contains binary genes\nfrom both previously seen malicious and legitimate software, which helps us to focus on only the\nunique and malicious genes per file (without wasting time on shared library code, for example).\n\nIntezer’s technology also helped us to automatically unpack samples which were packed\n(statically or dynamically), and to ignore the irrelevant binary parts, such as library code. Since\nthe genome database contains all of the genes from the files that we have collected, the output of\nthis process was an automatically generated connections graph, based on the unique Russian\ncode, for further investigation of the results as described in the following sections.\n\n## visualizing the connections визуализация связей\n\nNow that we have analyzed thousands of samples for code similarities, it is time to gather all the\nfound connections in one visual place. Our current situation is that we basically have two lists –\n\n1. A list of all the samples\n\nSha256, Label, Actor\n2. A list of found connections\n\nsha256_sampleA, sha256_sampleB, # of shared genes\n\nThis is all we need in order to create an initial graph of connections, in which every sample is a\nnode (vertex), and a connection between two samples is an edge. We created the initial graph\n[using the networkx library for Python and produced a .gexf file that later can be used in our](https://networkx.github.io/)\nfavorite graph visualizer tool, Gephi.\n\n\n**_Gephi is an open-source interactive visualization and exploration platform for all kinds of networks and com‐_**\n_plex systems, dynamic and hierarchical graphs._\n\n**_GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format) is a language for describing complex networks structures, their asso‐_**\n_ciated data and dynamics._\n\n\n-----\n\nBy loading the produced file to Gephi, we begin with a complex and crowded web of connections.\nIn order to make it look clearer, we’d need to apply some layout algorithms to it.\n\n**_Figure 1: the initial graph as created by Gephi_**\n\nWithout getting too deep into Graph Theory and Graph Drawing, layout algorithms are\nresponsible for the way that vertices and edges are arranged in the graph. This has a direct effect\non the aesthetics, understandability, and usability of the graph. For our graph, we chose a Force[Directed layout algorithm, or more specifically – Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm.](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Fruchterman-Reingold)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: The graph of connections after applying layout algorithms_**\n\nNow we can notice some big clusters that are created and bridges between two or more clusters\nlike this. Circular and complete-linkage clusters are most likely to be collections of samples of the\nsame family. Two clusters that are joined together are most likely to belong to the same family\n(different variants) or to the same ancestry. There are many clusters, big ones, and smaller ones.\nThe different sizes indicate the number of nodes in the cluster. This is something that can be\neither relevant or irrelevant depending on the situation. We need to remember, after all, a graph\nwill present the data it was given with. Thus, the size of the cluster is directly affected by the\nnumber of samples of the same family that were in our dataset. The family may indeed be a big\none, but it is possible that the samples of this family were simply more accessible for us.\n\nNow that we have the shape of the graph, let’s add another layer – text, and colors. In our\nresearch, we want to show connections between families and actors. Thus, for each node on the\ngraph, we will add a label with its name and a unique color per attributed actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3: Colors applied to the graph in order to make it more readable_**\n\n## analyzing the connections анализ связей\n\nNow that Gephi did its magic and we have a nice, yet busy, visual graph, it is time to inspect the\nthousands of connections, starting from the most interesting ones – cross actor edges.\n\nA cross-actor edge is a line connecting two nodes that are attributed to different actors. Such a\nconnection, when verified, can indicate that two or more actors shared code.\n\n_While there are thousands of inter-family connections on the graph (a code is shared between_\n_samples of the same family) and cross-family connections (a code is shared between samples of_\n_different families attributed to the same actor), it is uncommon to see cross-actor connections._\n\nIn order to analyze the graph and its connections, we used Gephi’s Python API module. We wrote\nseveral clean-up scripts to remove and reduce false-positives and false attributions. Then, we\nextracted a list of connections between samples belong to different actors.\n\nWe then moved to our favorite part – reverse-engineering the shared genes in order to verify the\nunique mutuality or to flag the connection as false-positive.\n\n_A false-positive connection, in our terminology, would be a connection which is indeed true (the_\n_samples do share code), but not uniquely true. Mutually shared genes that we flagged as false-_\n_positive most-likely belong to some version of an open-source library, such as PolarSSL, B-Zip or_\n_a fork of any other open-source library._\n\nThis part required us to analyze the mutual pieces of code that were shared by two or more\nsamples in order to understand the nature of the connection. By looking at the shared code, we\ncould understand the goal of this code, how it is being used and in what context it was written.\n\nIn this part, we also verified that our research was able to spot and detect previously reported\nconnections between samples and actors, be it a TTP connection or a code-connection. In some\ncases, we are the first to provide code-based evidence for the connections.\n\n## interesting connections интересные связи\n\nNow, with the code connections graph in place, we were able to examine the interesting\nconnections between the different Russian APTs. We have observed many connections between\ndifferent tools used from the same actors, which ranged between a specific function to a whole\nmodule. Code similarities between samples of different actors were much rarer to find and those\nthat we did find are not unique or big enough to indicate that code or modules were actively\nshared. Here are the highlights of these connections.\n\n### BlackEnergy Password Stealer <—> PinchDuke\n\nBoth share credential dumping implementation for Outlook and “The Bat!” – which is a Moldovan\n[email client. We know that PinchDuke is based on an old credential stealer called Pinch (LdPinch)](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030745/dukes_whitepaper.pdf)\nthat was distributed in Russian speaking underground forums about a decade ago, and we\nbelieve that this shared piece of code between BlackEnergy and PinchDuke has originated from\nth Pi h d N t l th t l f ti t l b t th l t l\n\n\n-----\n\n_Pinch Duke [0ce3bfa972ced61884ae7c1d77c7d4c45e17c7d767e669610cf2ef72b636b464]_\n\n_Black Energy [3cf46c68dccb989fbda3f853cc19025d39d38d9ea5786f4ae6a926677d6c5f62]_\n\n### BlackEnergy <—> Energetic Bear\n\n[As published by McAfee, we also observed identical self-delete functions between BlackEnergy](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-dragonfly-analysis-suggests-links-to-earlier-attacks/)\nsample from 2015 and the newer Energetic Bear (Dragonfly) sample from 2017. Despite the fact\nthat self-delete functions are pretty common in malware, it is rare to see an exact 1:1 match in the\nbinary level, which matches only for these two malware families out of all the malware families\nindexed in Intezer’s Genome Database. We believe that this function was not actively shared\n[between these actors, but instead, was taken from a public source.](https://www.c-plusplus.net/forum/topic/157481/selbstl%C3%B6schende-dll-m%C3%B6glich)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Black Energy [11b7b8a7965b52ebb213b023b6772dd2c76c66893fc96a18a9a33c8cf125af80]_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Energetic Bear [fc54d8afd2ce5cb6cc53c46783bf91d0dd19de604308d536827320826bc36ed9]_\n\n### Potao Main Module <—> X-Agent\n\n[Both Potao’s main module sample from ESET’s publication and X-Agent sample which was](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Operation-Potao-Express_final_v2.pdf)\n[uncovered by USCYBERCOM share slightly similar PE Loader implementation.

Basically, this\nside-panel is a short identity-card of the entities on the map.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: A side panel with additional information about the nodes_**\n\nThe map and its data are available open-sourced in our repository and we are inviting you all to\nadd more information and improve it.\n\n\n-----\n\n### APT Scanning Tool\n\nHaving access to more than 3.5 Million pieces of code that were shared between the Russian\nAPT samples we gathered, allowed us to understand which unique genes are popular and more\nlikely to be shared between samples, families, and actors. We used this knowledge to write a tool\nthat can be used by organizations, CERT teams, researchers, and individuals to scan a specific\nfile, a folder, or a whole file system, and search for infections by Russian APTs.\n\nThe tool, which we named Russian APT Detector, is a set of Yara rules produced by Intezer’s\nplatform. The rules contain byte-sequences of popular mutual code between one or more\n[samples. We then wrapped it up in a binary to ease the use of the tool. The full ruleset can be](https://github.com/ITAYC0HEN/APT-Ecosystem/tree/master/russia/detector)\nfound in our repository and can be used freely using your favorite Yara scanner.

Using publicly known information we were able to gather, classify and analyze thousands of\nsamples attributed to one of the most active and advanced cyber-espionage ecosystem, the\nRussian. Throughout this research, we analyzed and investigated dozens of potential pieces of\ncode-based evidence that may indicate that code was shared between different Russian military,\ngovernmental and intelligence entities.\n\nThe connections we analyzed clearly showed that pieces of code such as functions, whole or\npartial module and, encryption schemes were shared between different teams and projects of the\nsame actor. That means that different malware families of the same organization are sharing such\ncode. This information may suggest that different teams, belonging to the same organization, are\naware of each other’s work and operations. By sharing code with each other, the teams can save\nhundreds of man-hours and a lot of money. Instead of re-implementing capabilities that already\nexist, the teams can focus on other things and re-use the code. Another benefit of using an\nexisting code is that most likely, the code was tested in real-life cyber operations and the team\nthat developed it had an experience of using and improving it. On the other hand, the price of\nsharing and re-using code is that when it gets caught by a security vendor or researchers, the\nshared pieces of code can be used to find new samples and familiesזthat are using the code.\nThus, one detected family can make more operations fall apart.\n\nInterestingly, our analysis and observations showed that when it comes to cross-actor\nconnections, in the vast majority of times, None of the connections we analyzed indicated that\nsome pieces of code are shared between two or more organizations. We find it very interesting\nand unexpected. While we can’t know for sure what brought the organizations in the Russian APT\nEcosystem not to share code with each other, we can make some hypotheses.\n\nA reasonable option can be that Russia, having one of the most advanced and strong cyberespionage capabilities, is aware of the disadvantages of code-sharing that we listed above. By\navoiding different organizations re-using the same tools on a wide range of targets, they\novercome the risk that one compromised operation will expose other active operations,\n\n\n-----\n\nagain, instead of sharing tools, libraries or frameworks, causing redundancy in this parallel\nactivity. If this is true, this can indicate that Operational Security has a priceless meaning for the\nRussian actors.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the different organizations do not share code due to internal politics.\nSince we are not familiar enough with the politics and the relationships between Russia’s\nintelligence organizations, this hypothesis should be taken with caution.\n\n## acknowledgments благодарности\n\nWe want to thank our team leaders, Mark Lechtik and Ari Eitan, for accompanying us in this\nresearch, for helping a lot and for always giving interesting and important insights.
