Diane helped with the_\n_translation portion of this research._\n\nThe Lookout [Threat Intelligence team has discovered a new mobile app threat targeting iOS](https://www.lookout.com/products/threat-intelligence?utm_source=BL&utm_medium=BL&utm_campaign=WW-MU-MU-MU-MU-P_NON-Goontact)\nand Android users in Chinese speaking countries, Korea and Japan. The spyware, which we\nhave named Goontact, targets users of illicit sites, typically offering escort services, and\nsteals personal information from their mobile device. The types of sites used to distribute\nthese malicious apps and the information exfiltrated suggests that the ultimate goal is\nextortion or blackmail.\n\n**We found that Goontact, which often disguises itself as secure messaging applications, can**\n**exfiltrate a wide range of data, such as:**\n\nDevice identifiers and phone number.\nContacts.\n\n\n-----\n\nSMS messages.\nPhotos on external storage.\nLocation information.\n\nTablets and smartphones are a treasure trove of personal data. These devices store private\ndata, such as contacts, photos, messages and location. Access to all of this data enables\ncybercriminals like the operators of Goontact to run a successful extortion campaign.\n\n## Malicious functionality and impact\n\nThese sextortion scams are exploiting Chinese-, Japanese- and Korean-speaking people in\nmultiple Asian countries. Evidence on distribution sites also suggests that this operation is\nfunctional in China, Japan, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nThe scam begins when a potential target is lured to one of the hosted sites where they are\ninvited to connect with women. Account IDs for secure messaging apps such as KakaoTalk\nor Telegram are advertised on these sites as the best forms of communication and the\nindividual initiates a conversation.\n\n_Lure site screenshots for Goontact that invite visitors to contact a KakaoTalk ID or a_\n_Telegram ID to access the services being advertised._\n\nIn reality, the targets are communicating with Goontact operators. Targets are convinced to\ninstall (or sideload) a mobile application on some pretext, such as audio or video problems.\nThe mobile applications in question appears to have no real user functionality, except to steal\nthe victim’s address book, which is then used by the attacker ultimately to extort the target for\nmonetary gain.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Potential attribution\n\nWe found that the websites associated with Goontact bear many similarities in naming\nconvention, appearance and targeted geographic region. The sites also used logos\nassociated with domains that were part of a sextortion campaign reported by Trend Micro in\n2015.1\n\nWe believe this campaign is operated by a crime affiliate, rather than nation state actors.\nWhile we have yet to uncover any definitive infrastructure links, we believe it is highly\nprobable that Goontact is the newest addition to this threat actor's arsenal. Most notably,\n**the iOS component of this scam has not been reported on before.**\n\nBased on our research, the campaign has been active since at least 2013. However, the\nGoontact malware family is novel and is still actively being developed. The earliest sample of\nGoontact observed by Lookout was in November 2018, with matching APK packaging and\nsigning dates, leading us to believe malware development likely started in this time frame.\n\n## Goontact iOS\n\n_Recent active Goontact distribution sites mimicking App Store pages. The servers used for_\n_distribution of the malware also host a login panel indicating that they serve as command-_\n_and-control (C2) servers. The apps are under continuous development and have been_\n\n\n-----\n\n_updated multiple times per month._\n\nEarly samples of the iOS version of Goontact show the primary functionality is to steal a\nvictim’s phone number and contact list. Later iterations incorporated functionality to\ncommunicate to a secondary command-and-control (C2) server and display a message to\nthe user that has been tailored by the attacker, before exiting the app.\n\n_Code that exfiltrates a victim’s address list from an infected device._\n\n**Signing identities**\n\nGoontact on iOS relies on the user side-loading an IPA file from a distribution site. These\nsites contained links to a distribution manifest, which provides a download URL for the IPA.\nTo successfully do this, Goontact abuses the Apple enterprise provisioning system.\n\nTo be distributed outside the App Store, an IPA file must contain a mobile provisioning profile\nwith an enterprise certificate. These enterprise certificates can be generated from the Apple\nDeveloper console and can then be used to code sign apps using a signing identity tied to\nthe company’s developer profile or TeamID. The operators of Goontact were able to obtain\nenterprise certificates apparently associated with legitimate businesses to sign their malware\nwhich was then distributed on sites mimicking App Store pages.\n\nThe Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to permit organizations to distribute\nproprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A\nbusiness can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by\nApple.\n\n[This is a similar tactic used by other iOS threats we have observed such as eSurvAgent. It](https://blog.lookout.com/esurv-research)\nrequires the user to download the app through a browser, install it, navigate to their Settings\napp and then explicitly trust the signing identity used to sign the IPA file. Only after a\n\n\n-----\n\nverification process of the signing identity with Apple s servers, is the app able to run on an\niOS device.\n\n_Screenshots of a live distribution site providing instructions on how to install the iOS version_\n_of Goontact. In the rightmost image above, the name of the company whose signing identity_\n_was used to create the mobile provisioning profile for the app can be seen._\n\nThe enterprise mobile provisioning profiles used by Goontact all reference apparently\nlegitimate companies. The list, as shown below, includes companies registered in China and\nin the United States across various sectors such as power generation companies, credit\nunions, and railroad companies.\n\n**TeamID**\n\nAKSVA57833\n\n5YMLXQ5HEE\n\nVWEN6QTM5A\n\nGCDHET33K9\n\nKRDUAN5QNS\n\n7TLJH7GP4B\n\n5383H5PWBS\n\n229BL7A3HR\n\n7RZF8699DK\n\n**TeamName (Company Name)**\n\n\n-----\n\nJinhua Changfeng Information Technology Co., Ltd.\nQingdao Haier Technology Co., Ltd.\nLinkplay Tech Inc.\nNorfolk Southern Corporation\nDalian Rural Commercial Bank Co., Ltd.\nDaikin Airconditioning (Hong Kong) Ltd\nAbleSky Inc.\nGUANGZHOU INSOONTO NETPAY TECHNOLOGY CO.; LTD.\nGuangzhou Jianxin Automation Technology Co.,Ltd.\n\nMost of the companies observed either have current or past developer profiles and\napplications on the iOS App Store. However, It is still unclear to us whether these signing\nidentities have truly been compromised, or if they were created by the malware operators\nmasquerading as representatives of the companies in question.\n\nDuring our research we observed multiple signing identities being revoked. In those cases,\nnew malware samples using a new identity immediately appeared on the distribution sites.\nWe sometimes observed this occurring multiple times a month, indicating the actors behind\nGoontact have little difficulty acquiring access to additional accounts.\n\n**Goontact Android**\n\nThe Android component of Goontact is much more feature-rich. In addition to contact\nstealing, these samples contain more advanced functionality such as exfiltration of SMS\nmessages, photos and location.\n\n_Icons of Goontact Android samples displaying the possible lures used in the campaign to_\n_entice individuals to download and install the malware samples._\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nMost command-and-control (C2) domains leveraged by Goontact are sites also hosting the\niOS variant of the malware. Almost all active malware C2s have login panels on nonstandard ports such as 8085 and 9905\n\n\n-----\n\n_All live C2 panels are in Chinese. This evidence, along with names of the companies being_\n_used for developer profiles suggest that the developers and operators of the campaign are_\n_Chinese speakers._\n\nThe path component of the C2 URL in current samples commonly includes “/JYSystem/” on\nboth iOS and Android, which is a reference to an open source HTML template available on\nGithub.2 After exploring the infrastructure during our research, we discovered dozens of\nactive sites with the same patterns hosting numerous IPA files. A number of them are listed\nin our screenshot below but new domains are registered daily. These domains were linked to\neach other using shared IP addresses and SSL certificates.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Domains generally appear to include the names of secure messaging apps in their names_\n_and the campaign prefers the use of .top and .vip TLDs._\n\nLure sites are middleman sites that offer the option of setting up dates and chats with women\nafter paying a session fee. Recent lure sites include links to the malicious applications and\nprovide detailed installation instructions to the victims. The malicious APK files have been\nobserved to be hosted on the lure sites, but the IPA files are all hosted on separate\ndistribution sites as described above.\n\n_A lure site (red-v10[.]com) in Korean links back to Goontact samples hosted on one of the_\n_distribution sites (redvios[.]com) along with instructions on how to install it. Sites are sensitive_\n_to User-Agent headers in order to display an application appropriate for the device of the_\n_user._\n\nWhile the Goontact surveillance apps described in this campaign are not available on Google\nPlay or the iOS App Store, the duration, breadth and tactics exhibited highlight the lengths\nmalicious actors will go to deceive victims and bypass built-in protections. Lookout secures\nconsumers and enterprise users from Goontact. On Android, all Lookout users are protected,\nwhereas on iOS, Lookout for Work users and Lookout Premium Plus subscribers are\nprotected.\n\nLookout Threat Advisory Services customers have already been notified with additional\n[intelligence on this and other threats.
