    "plain_text": "# What Service NSW has to do with Russia?\n\n**osint.fans/service-nsw-russia-association**\n\nGabor Szathmari September 22, 2020\n\n22 Sep 2020 • Posted by Gabor Szathmari\n\n3 min read\n\n[One interesting offshoot of researching .gov.au websites running outside Australia was an](https://osint.fans/risk-australian-gov-services-hosted-overseas)\nodd service running from Russia. How the Service NSW – a website offering government\nservices online – ended up associating with a Russian datacentre?\n\n[According to this Shodan query, the domain name](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=hostname%3Agov.au+-country%3AAU+country%3A%22RU%22) `mta.comms.service.nsw.gov.au (an`\nemail server belonging to Service NSW) appear to be hosted on the IP address\n```\n82.202.226.62 .\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nSix Australian Government-related services appear to be running from ... Russia?\n[The GeoIP database shows that this IP (82.202.226.62) belongs to Selectel, an IT company](https://ipinfo.io/82.202.226.62)\nwith six data centres in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nWhat is going on here?\n\nBefore anyone gets excited, there is no direct association between Service NSW and\n**Russia. The reality is more boring, but with a clever twist.**\n\n## Links to banking malware\n\n[According to Hybrid Analysis report from earlier, the IP address](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/3782f96c6d9f3136651da208465fa939313b7e4f21bdc4ef10c05926e0428a65/5abb75b27ca3e1643c798a83) `82.202.226.62 was`\nassociated with a phishing campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nA malware analysis of a phishing campaign shows the IP is associated with malware.\nThe phishing campaign featured a Word document with a malicious payload trying to\ndownload a banking trojan on the victims’ computer. The screenshots of this Word document\nwith the malicious payload indicate that the campaign was targeting NatWest (UK bank)\ncustomers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phishing campaign was targeting NatWest Bank customers in the UK.\nAn additional search reveals that the Russian IP address is (was) associated with a banking\n[trojan called Trickbot. This piece of malicious software was developed in 2016 with the sole](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/trojan-trickbot/)\npurpose of stealing from bank accounts, Bitcoin wallets and downloading other harmful code\nto the victims’ PC.\n\n[According to Vulners, the IP (82.202.226.62) appears to be a ‘Command and Control’ (C2)](https://vulners.com/sslabuse/SSLABUSE:TRICKBOT_CC)\nserver, which is an important network infrastructure element to control and operate the\nbotnet.\n\n\n-----\n\nVulners.com confirms that the Russian IP address was associated with the Trickbot baking\ntrojan.\n\n## How Trickbot is related to Service NSW?\n\nThe last remaining question is, what Trickbot has to do with the NSW Government? If we do\na reverse DNS lookup on `82.202.226.62, it resolves to`\n\n\n-----\n\nA reverse DNS lookup shows that the Russian IP resolves to a Service NSW domain name.\nThe answer is that it is a clever attempt to disguise any communication between the infected\nPCs and the Trickbot C2 server (82.202.226.62) on corporate networks.\n\nBig companies usually monitor and log network traffic originating from their internal network.\nIf a security analyst drills into the network logs to identify covert communication channels\nbetween the corporate network and C2 servers on the Internet, a reverse DNS lookup on\n```\n82.202.226.62 will result in the innocuous-looking domain name\nmta.comms.service.nsw.gov.au seemingly belonging to a government-run website.\n\n```\nAs DNS records for reverse DNS lookups are managed by the hosting provider (Selectel in\nthis case), the malware operator may choose any arbitrary hostname to deceive security\nanalysts.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe website on the Russian IP address was likely to be hacked and turned into a C2 server.\nThis is confirmed when we visit `http://82.202.226.62 . The website on this IP address`\nseems to belong to a chemical company based in Russia. The website is hosted on\nWordPress, which was likely to be hacked and turned into a Command and Control server\nfor the banking malware.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSecurity analysis should not always trust reverse DNS lookups when hunting for malware. As\nthis example shows, the operators of Trickbot were actively trying to evade detection by\ndisguising the Command and Control IP address as a legitimate NSW Government service.\n\n[What Service NSW can do in this situation is contacting either Selectel or RU-CERT to have](https://www.cert.ru/en/about.shtml)\nthe deceptive reverse DNS record removed.\n\n### Related Posts\n\n[Gumtree and Australia Post Credit Card Scam](https://osint.fans/gumtree-australia-post-credit-card-scam)\n\n[tfvpn – A self-hosted VPN for OSINT investigations](https://osint.fans/tfvpn-for-osint-investigations)\n\n[Full Address Search with the Unclaimed Money Portal](https://osint.fans/full-address-search-unclaimed-money-portal)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Bulletproftlink - A phishing service from Malaysia (Part 3)](https://osint.fans/bulletproftlink-phishing-service-p3)\n\n[BulletProftLink - A phishing service from Malaysia (Part 2)](https://osint.fans/bulletproftlink-phishing-service-p2)\n\n\n-----",
