The release of M-Trends[®] 2020 marks 11 years of providing the cyber security community with insights gained from the frontlines of those attacks.\n\nIn earlier editions of M-Trends, we observed that while some things change, many\nthings remain the same. For example, M-Trends 2010 discussed how phishing\nwas the most common and successful method APT groups were using to gain\ninitial access to an organization. That hasn’t changed. Many of the case studies in\n_M-Trends 2020 also begin with phishing, perpetuating the widely held belief that_\npeople are typically the weakest link in the security chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile attacker tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) may not be changing\ndramatically, the overall trends are still evolving. For example, organizations are\nmigrating to the cloud at an increasing rate, so M-Trends 2020 details cloudrelated incidents and some cloud best practices. Additional shifting trends and\nfresh observations in M-Trends 2020 include:\n\n- Attackers continue to grow more adept at working across a range of\n\noperating systems and device types, as well as in both on-premises and\ncloud architectures. Traditional barriers to attacker success continue to lessen\nover time. Put simply, more attackers can do more things in more diverse\nenvironments.\n\n- APT41, a recently named prolific cyber threat group, is responsible for carrying\n\nout Chinese state-sponsored espionage and financially motivated activity.\nThis group dates back to at least 2012, when they were conducting financially\nmotivated operations primarily targeting the video game industry—activity that\npreceded their state-sponsored campaigns.\n\n- Of all the malware families observed by FireEye this year, 41 percent were\n\npreviously unknown. This means that malware authors are innovating—possibly\nin an attempt to evade detection technologies—and not just relying on updates\nto existing malware.\n\n- Cyber criminals that historically targeted personal and credit card information\n\nare increasingly turning to ransomware as a secondary source of income. Cyber\ncriminals are also outsourcing tasks to monetize operations faster.\n\n- To expand the way they monetize operations, attackers have been observed\n\ntargeting corporate reward systems to steal gift cards. These gift cards are then\nresold or used to make direct purchases.\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course no edition of M-Trends would be complete without our “By the\nNumbers” data. Many readers are eager to learn if the industry is getting better at\ndetecting attacks; this year, the answer is yes. From October 1, 2018, to September\n30, 2019, the global median dwell time was 56 days. That’s a big improvement over\nthe 78-day global median dwell time we reported in M-Trends 2019.\n\nIn addition to dwell time data, this year we have introduced three new statistics to\nBy the Numbers—an overview of which threat groups were active over the past\nyear, an overview of new malware families observed in 2019 and a heat map of\nthreat techniques aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n\nWhile TTPs, trends and observations may have evolved over the past decade,\nthe goal of M-Trends has always stayed the same: to arm security teams with the\nknowledge they need to defend against today’s most often used cyber attacks, as\nwell as lesser seen and emerging threats.\n\nThe information in this report has been sanitized to protect identities of victims\nand data.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### BY THE\n NUMBERS\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Data from FireEye Mandiant Investigations\n\n The statistics reported in M-Trends 2020 are based on FireEye Mandiant investigations of targeted attack activity conducted between October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019.\n\n**Internal detection is** **Detection by Source**\nwhen an organization Over the last year, Mandiant consultants observed a 12-percentage point decrease\nindependently\ndiscovers that it has in the proportion of compromises detected internally. This is the largest decrease\nbeen compromised. in this metric since 2011. For the first time in four years, external notifications\n\nexceeded internal detections. This shift is potentially due to a variety of factors,\nsuch as increases in cyber security vendor and law enforcement notifications,\ncontinued expansion of the cyber security industry, changes in public disclosure\nnorms and compliance changes. It is unlikely that organizations’ ability to detect\nintrusions deteriorated, because other metrics show continued improvements in\n\n**External notification**\n\norganizational detections and response.\n\n\n###### Data from FireEye Mandiant Investigations\n\n The statistics reported in\n 2018 and September 30, 2019.\n\n**Internal detection is** **Detection by Source**\nwhen an organization\nindependently\ndiscovers that it has\nbeen compromised.\n\n**External notification**\n\norganizational detections and response.\n\nis when an outside\nentity informs an\norganization that it has\nbeen compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DETECTION BY SOURCE\n\n**Compromise**\n**Notifications**\n\n**External**\n\n**Internal**\n\n###### REGIONAL DETECTION BY SOURCE\n\n|Compromise Notifications External Internal|2011 94% 6%|2012 63% 37%|2013 67% 33%|2014 69% 31%|2015 53% 47%|2016 47% 53%|2017 38% 62%|2018 41% 59%|2019 53% 47%|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nAMERICAS\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\nAPAC\n\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n80\n\n60\n\n\n**73%**\n\n\n**52%** **56%**\n\n40\n\n20\n\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\n**27%**\n\n\nExternal Internal\n\n\nExternal\n\n\nInternal\n\n\nExternal Internal\n\n\n###### REGIONAL DETECTION BY SOURCE--2018-2019 COMPARISON\n\n70\n\n\n30\n\n40\n\n\n60\n\n50\n\n\n40\n\n30\n\n\n50\n\n60\n\n\n20\n\n\n70\n\n80\n\n|Col1|62 38|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||A m e ric a s 56 44 52 E M EA||\n||48 44 40 56||\n||60 A P A C||\n||27 73||\n\n\n2018 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n**Median Dwell Time**\n###### 416 > 56\n**DAYS IN 2011** **DAYS IN 2019**\n\n\nOrganizations are finding and containing attackers faster.

Twelve percent of\ninvestigations had dwell times greater than 700 days which is consistent with the\nprevious year.\n\nThese trends could be due to organizations developing their detection programs,\nas well as changes in attacker behaviors. Mandiant experts have seen a continued\nrise in disruptive attacks (such as ransomware and cryptocurrency miners) which\noften have shorter dwell times than other attack types.\n\n10%\n\n7% 7%\n\n8% 6% 6%\n\n4% 6%\n\n3% 5% 3%\n\n4% 4% 2% 2%\n\n1% 1%\n\n2% 0 1%\n\nDwell time (days)\n\n\n**20**\n\n**15**\n\n\n**10**\n\n**5**\n\n\n**0**\n\n\n2018\n2019\n\n\n-----\n\n###### AMERICAS MEDIAN DWELL TIME\n\nNotifications All\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n**Median Dwell Time**\n###### 71  > 60\n\n**DAYS IN 2018** **DAYS IN 2019**\n\n\nIn the Americas, median dwell time continued its downward trend. Mandiant analysts\nreviewed all investigations in the Americas with a dwell time of 14 days or fewer to\nidentify factors contributing to the decline. Disruptive attacks such as ransomware\nwere involved in 43% of these investigations. Such attacks had a similar contribution\nto the downward trend in dwell time in prior years. It is important to note that our\nresearchers have also observed multiple instances of dwell times for disruptive\nattacks well above the overall median. Other factors contributing to the decrease in\nmedian dwell time in the Americas included internal detections (30%) owing to the\nvigilance of security staff and investments in advanced technology and managed\ndetection and response (MDR) services. The final 27% of incidents with dwell times\nof 14 or fewer days were identified through some very efficient external notifications.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APAC MEDIAN DWELL TIME\n\nNotifications All\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n**Median Dwell Time**\n\n###### 204 > 54\n**DAYS IN 2018** **DAYS IN 2019**\n\n\nThe median dwell time for APAC during 2019 decreased to 54 days, from 204 days\nin the prior year.\n\nThis statistic is skewed by the significant amount of ransomware-related breaches\n(18% of all cases), which have a dwell time of zero days.\n\nWithout those ransomware cases, the median dwell time for APAC would be\n94 days, still an improvement over the prior year, but more indicative of the real\ntrend observed in the region and in line with the median dwell times reported in\n_M-Trends 2018 (498 days), and M-Trends 2019 (204 days)._\n\nWe have observed that the dwell time trend is still reflective of several advanced\nbreaches that remained undetected for a long time. Ten percent of breaches\ninvestigated during 2019 showed dwell times of more than three years, with the\nlongest dwell-time reported in APAC being 2,854 days—nearly eight years. As in\npast years, attackers in APAC still maintain access in compromised organizations\nfor far too long.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### EMEA MEDIAN DWELL TIME\n\nNotifications All\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\n**Median Dwell Time**\n###### 177 > 54\n**DAYS IN 2018** **DAYS IN 2019**\n\n\nEMEA has seen a marked reduction in dwell times. In M-Trends 2019, we suggested\nthat a steep rise in median dwell time was likely linked with organizations putting\nmore emphasis on GDPR and increasing focus on security which may have\nrevealed historic compromises. EMEA statistics are now generally in line with the\nglobal averages, which reflect the improving security posture of organizations\nand highlight the ongoing challenges organizations face from sophisticated\nthreat actors. While significant improvements have been made, attackers still go\nundetected in target environments for far too long, remaining stealthy and harder\nto spot as they pursue their goals.\n\nExternal notifications outnumbered internal detections compared to last year.\nThis reflects the volume of notifications that organizations receive and the various\nsources of external notifications which are expanding beyond the traditional law\nenforcement notifications. While some of these EMEA incidents with external\ndwell times were long-running intrusions, many of them were remnants of historic\nattacks rather than active attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Industry Targeting\n\nWe continue to see consistent industry targeting in the last year when compared\nto past M-Trends. This consistency is the strongest in the “Top 10” industries year\nover year and is unlikely to substantively change for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n###### TARGETED INDUSTRIES\n\n\nRank 2019\n\n1\n\n2 4\n\n3 5\n\n4 11 t\n\n5\n\n6 1\n\n7\n\n8 3\n\n9 8\n\n10\n\n11 10 t\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\n2018\n\n\n2017\n\n\n2016\n\n\n2015\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Targeted Attacks and Retargeting\n\nMandiant professionals responded to a number of attacks in the past year,\nobserving that:\n\n- 7% originated with or used compromised third party access\n\n- 15% had multiple attackers\n\n- Less than 1% involved an insider\n\n- 22% had data theft likely in support of intellectual property or espionage\n\nend goals\n\n- 29% were likely for direct financial gain. This includes extortion, ransom, card\n\ntheft, and illicit transfers\n\n- 3% of these targeted attacks were for the purpose of reselling access gained in\n\nthe intrusion\n\n- 4% likely served no purpose except for creating compromised architecture to\n\nfurther other attacks\n\nEleven percent of all Mandiant engagements in this period were for responses\nor assessments in environments with a significant cloud component. Overall, we\ncontinue to see more clients adopt a hybrid environment strategy using a mix of\non-premises and cloud architecture or services. And attackers are becoming more\ncomfortable working across such hybrid environments to pursue their goals.\n\n###### Re-Attack Rate\nIn 2019, 31% of FireEye Mandiant Managed Defense customers who previously\nunderwent a Mandiant Incident Response engagement were attacked within the\nfollowing 12 months. In this context, an attack is considered to be an event in which\none or more systems with unauthorized activity required further investigation.\nSuch an investigation goes beyond the data typically reviewed or acquired to\ndetermine the legitimacy of an alert.\n\nSimilarly, in 2018, FireEye identified that the same percentage of Managed Defense\ncustomers, 31%, were attacked in the following 12 months. This re-emphasizes\nthe need for organizations to be vigilant, especially those who have previously\nexperienced an incident.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threat Groups\n\nOur clients encountered activity from a wide range of established threat groups, as\nwell as hundreds of new threat groups that emerged in the last year (Fig. 1).\nSix of 10 named financial threat groups (FIN) and 17 named APT groups (44% of all\nknown APT groups) from six different countries were active. These named groups\nwere joined by 159 other groups in intrusion attempts against our clients.\n\n\n**Figure 1.**\nActive threat\ngroups tracked.\n\n\n**Total**\n**Tracked Efforts**\n\n\n###### 6\n2019 Active\nFIN Groups\n\n###### 10\n\nFIN Groups **159**\n\nEncountered\nDuring Active\nFireEye\n\n###### 461 InvestigationsMandiant\n\nNew Groups\nIdentified\nin 2019\n\n###### 1800+\nTotal Groups\n\n###### 41 17 6\nAPT 2019 Active Active\nGroups APT Groups APT Groups\nFrom These\nNation-States\n\n###### 22 • Russia• China\nNation    - Iran\nStates    - North Korea\n\n                        - Vietnam\n\n                          - Pakistan\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2.**\nMalware trends.\n\n\n###### Malware\n\nOur ability to analyze malicious code and assign them to malware families remains\ncritical to incident response efforts. In 2019, we observed over 500 new malware\nfamilies, 58% of which were discovered through Mandiant service efforts, including\nincident responses (Fig. 2). The majority of these new samples either impacted\nWindows or multiple platforms. While we do see new malware families solely\nimpacting macOS and Linux, they remain in the minority.\n\n**2019**\n**Malware Families** **45**\n\nNew Linux\nEffective\nMalware\n\n**Total** **141**\n**Malware Families** Linux\nEffective\nMalware **16**\n\nNew Linux\nOnly Malware\n\n###### 67\nLinux Only\nMalware\n\n**1.1 million Malware Samples** **1268**\nTotal Tracked\n**Analyzed Per Day**\nMalware Families\n\n\n###### 45\n\nNew Linux\nEffective\nMalware\n\n###### 141\n\nLinux\nEffective\nMalware **16**\n\nNew Linux\nOnly Malware\n\n###### 67\nLinux Only\nMalware\n\nTotal Tracked\n\n###### 55\nMac Effective\nMalware **16**\n\nNew Mac\nEffective\nMalware\n\n###### 11\nMac Only\nMalware\n\n###### 1\nNew Mac\nOnly Malware\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK is a**\npublicly-accessible\nknowledge base of\nadversary tactics and\ntechniques based on\nreal-world observations.\nIt was designed to be\na community-accepted\nand community-driven\nfoundation to align\nmethodologies and\ndrive improvements.\n\n\n###### Threat Techniques\n\nTo support community and industry efforts, our findings are now mapped to\nthe MITRE ATT&CK framework. There remains some variance in ATT&CK\ntechniques and naming conventions.\n\nOver the last two years, FireEye worked with MITRE to augment their ATT&CK\nframework and work on merging the FireEye technique catalog. Over 1300\nexisting FireEye techniques (and subsequent findings) have been mapped to\napplicable MITRE ATT&CK framework techniques. As FireEye continues to grow\nour techniques list and MITRE evolves the ATT&CK framework, we will continue\nto cross-map to improve both models, which may differ slightly from offerings by\nother vendors.\n\nIn 2019 a range of new techniques was used by threat actors, with a heavy reliance\non traditional, well-established actions. They included a mix of leveraging valid\naccess, use of valid client tools and attacker-owned files. Of the top five most\ncommon techniques, we observed three used for valid access (t1086, t1035, t1133),\none used for both valid and illicit access (t1064), and only one around purely\nattacker-derived tooling (t1027). This trend is pervasive throughout the full list\nof observed techniques (Fig. 3). We observed only 40% of all MITRE ATT&CK\ntechniques in use against FireEye clients. Of these, more than half were only seen\nin nine or fewer intrusions over the past year. While understanding the full range\nof attacker techniques is useful, developing effective response and remediation\nagainst just the top 10 covers the vast majority of actual attacker actions used in\nthe last year.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Top row: Mandiant Attack Lifecycle**\n\n**Subsections: MITRE ATT&CK Framework**\n\n\n**Figure 3.**\nMITRE ATT&CK\ntechniques related\nto attack

threat actors, including state-sponsored attackers responsible for carrying out advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks. Because the motivations of a state-sponsored attacker are often tied to strategic imperatives, APT threat actors often pursue their objectives over longer periods of time than other threat actors. Maintaining access to victim environments for months or years requires threat actors to be adept at handling attempts to remove their access.\n\n\n###### APT Named in 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2019, FireEye promoted one attack group from a tracked TEMP group to an APT\ngroup: APT41.\n\nAPT41 is a prolific cyber threat group responsible for carrying out Chinese\nstate-sponsored espionage as well as financially motivated activity. The group’s\nactivity dates to 2012 when APT41 conducted financially motivated operations\nfocused on the video game industry (Fig. 4). This activity preceded their statesponsored activity.\n\nAccessing video game production environments enabled APT41 to develop the\nTTPs that were later used to conduct software supply chain compromises. APT41\ncarried out the supply chain attacks to enable them to inject malicious code into\nlegitimate files, which would be used to compromise additional organizations.\nThese attacks affected a significant number of organizations and individuals,\nbut APT41 only conducted follow-on activity at a subset of victims, indicating\nAPT41 was interested in specific targets. The group’s distinct use of supply chain\ncompromises to target select individuals, consistent use of compromised digital\ncertificates and deployment of bootkits and rootkits (rare among APT operators),\nhighlighted a creative and well-resourced adversary.\n\nBased on early observed activity and APT41’s focus on the video game industry,\nwe believe the group’s cyber crime activities are most likely motivated by financial\ngain or hobbyist interests. This stands in contrast to the state-sponsored goals\nthat likely drive the group’s targeting of higher education, telecommunications,\ntravel services and news/media firms. The attacks appear to have been carried\nout as part of a surveillance operation. The group’s most recent activity included\ntargeting call record information and SMS data.\n\nTwo identified personas using the monikers “Zhang Xuguang” and “Wolfzhi”\nlinked to APT41 operations have also been identified in Chinese-language forums.\nThese individuals advertised their skills and services and indicated that they could\nbe hired.\n\nAPT41 is unique among China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware\ntypically reserved for espionage, in operations that appear to fall outside the scope\nof state-sponsored missions. The group’s mix of financial and state sponsored\nmotivations are remarkable because this type of activity is unusual among Chinese\nstate-sponsored threat groups.\n\nAPT41’s links to both underground marketplaces and state-sponsored activity may\nindicate the group is permitted to conduct its own for-profit activities. It is also\npossible that APT41 evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities. Regardless, APT41\noperations underscore a blurred line between state power and crime that lies at\nthe heart of threat ecosystems.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4.**\nAPT 41 TTPs across\nthe attack lifecycle.\n\n|Figure 4.

The term family\nbroadens the scope of\na single piece of\nmalware as it can be\naltered over time, which\nin turn creates new,\nbut fundamentally\noverlapping pieces\nof malware.\n\n\nMalware family code is often examined using disassembler or decompiler tools,\nthrough a process called reverse engineering. Being a family does not require the\ncode to be 100% identical. The most common differences FireEye sees among\nmembers of a family are related to configuration, command and control (CnC)\naddresses, and features. Depending on the features and how the malware evolves,\nFireEye sometimes identifies and tracks subgroups or subfamilies within a malware\nfamily. For FireEye Mandiant, defining a code family is part science and part art,\nand may involve comparison and analysis by automated systems and experts.\n\nIn samples found in the field between October 2018 and September 2019, Mandiant\nresearchers encountered 186 unique malware families, comprised of tens of\nthousands of malware samples. These statistics do not include malware that has\nbeen analyzed, but not assigned to a malware family.\n\n###### Highlights\n\n- 41% of the malware families seen this year were never seen before.\n\n- 70% of the samples identified belonged to one of the five most frequently seen\n\nfamilies, which are based on open source tools with active development.\n\n- 23% of the malware observed in this reporting period is publicly available and\n\nused by a range of attackers with varying skill levels.\n\n- The vast majority of malware is written to elevate privileges and move laterally in\n\nan environment.\n\nMandiant researchers analyzed the 186 unique malware families from Mandiant\nengagements this year to reveal six traits and trends. Traits focus on the malware\nspecifics, such as category, file type, accessibility and obfuscation. Trends include\nthe top families and how many of them were new in 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5.**\nCategories\nassigned to\nmalware families\nin 2019.\n\n\n###### Category Mandiant analysts assign categories to malware samples based on their\nclassification and behavior (Fig. 5). Each binary is placed into only one category.\nWhile a backdoor might have the ability to steal credentials, if the primary purpose\nof the malware was to function as a backdoor it would be counted as a backdoor.\nInversely, something will only be labeled as a credential stealer only if it’s primary\nfunction is to steal credentials.\n\nDropper\n\n\n**Malware category** **Primary purpose**\n\n**Backdoor** Allow an attacker to establish control over a victim host. Provides\ninteractive functionality such as sleep, file transfer, credential\nstealing, keylogging, reverse shells and process manipulation.\n\n**Dropper** Extract, install and potentially launch or execute one or more\nmalware files.\n\n**Credential Stealer** Access, copy or steal authentication credentials.\n\n**Point of Sale (POS)** Obtain payment card information.\n\n**Ransomware** Perform some malicious action (most often data encryption), with the\ngoal of denying access until a ransom is paid.\n\n**Other** Includes keyloggers, rootkits, bootkits and utilities. Keyloggers record\nkeystrokes. Rootkits hide other malware. Bootkits are embedded\ndeep in a system’s boot process. Utilities are tools and supporting\nfiles that perform functions such as clearing log files.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6.**\nFile types for\nmalware families\nseen in the\nlast year.\n\n\n###### File Type The file format or file structure of malware may indicate the architecture\nor operating system the attacker was targeting. Although most of the samples\nanalyzed were Portable Executable (PE) files, we had four Linux families (Fig. 6).\nThe remainder consists of scripts, WebShells, and .NET malware.\n\nScripts\n\n12%\n\nWebShells\n\n8%\n\n.NET\n\n\n**File type** **Descriptions**\n\n**Portable Executable (PE) Portable Executable; the executable file format for**\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n**WindowsScripts** Script-based malware e.g. JavaScript or Python\n\n**WebShells** Backdoors for web servers; many use PHP\n\n**.NET** A framework for applications; mostly written in C#\n\n**ELF** Executable file format for Linux\n\n**ELF & PE** Some malware families have both Windows and Linux versions\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7.**\nHow easy\nmalware families\nare obtained by\nattackers.\n\n**Figure 8.**\nAmount of\nobfuscated/packed\nmalware families.\n\n\n###### Accessibility Malware family accessibility (Fig. 7) is labeled as available or private.\nAvailable means that the sample is publicly available via open-source or can be\neasily obtained on underground forums. Private means that it isn’t easily found or\nis closed source.\n\nAvailable\n\n23%\n\n77%\nPrivate\n\n###### Obfuscation Scripts are obfuscated or packed to hinder analysis, especially\nby automated systems, since many static analysis tools cannot process such\nsamples. For example, a WebShell may change variable and function names,\ncontrol flow and string encoding. Malware in the form of executable files use\npacking to make their payloads small or inhibit analysis. Many open source and\ncommercial products can obfuscate or pack a sample.\n\nPacked or obfuscated samples are trivial to detect because they stand out due to\nhigh entropy; most benign executables are not packed or obfuscated (Fig. 8).\n\nObfuscated\n\n49%\n\n51%\nClear\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9.**\nNew Families\ndiscovered this\npast year.\n\n**Figure 10.**\nTop malware\nfamilies across\nvariants.\n\n\n###### New Families Forty-one percent of the malware families seen over the past year\nhad not been seen before by Mandiant researchers (Fig. 9).\n\nNew\n\n41%\n\n59%\nSeen\n\n###### Top Families After analyzing tens of thousands of malware variants across 186\nmalware families in 2019, we noted that over 70% of the variants belonged to just\nfive malware families (Fig. 10).\n\nSHORTBENCH\n\n13%\n\n11% TRICKBOT\n\n13%\n\nQAKBOT\n\n\n-----\n\nThese top five malware families are:\n\n**•** **BEACON A publicly available endpoint agent for Cobalt Strike. It is a popular**\n\ncommercial dual-use penetration toolkit with configurable CnC channels and a\nrobust feature set. While a new yearly license is $3500, this kit is readily available\non pirated websites and forums. Mandiant analysts have observed the following\nnamed attack groups using BEACON: APT19, APT32, APT40, APT41, FIN6, and\nFIN7. These groups represent a diverse mix of skillsets and motivations.\n\n**•** **EMPIRE An open-source post-exploitation framework and PowerShell endpoint**\n\nagent. It provides post-exploitation modules ranging from keyloggers to\nMimikatz, and adaptable network communications to evade network detection.\nMuch like BEACON, Mandiant has observed EMPIRE being used by a wide range\nof attackers at all skill levels, including APT19, APT33, and FIN10.\n\n**•** **TRICKBOT A modular banking trojan that uses web injects. This technique**\n\nallows malware to intercept users attempting to access legitimate websites\nand “injects” malicious content to steal credentials and financial information.\nDefault modules include banking and user Information theft, system/network\nreconnaissance and credential and network propagation. This framework is also\nused to install other malware and tools. Over the past year, we saw TRICKBOT\nused in conjunction with EMPIRE and RYUK (a ransomware tool) at a number of\nFireEye clients.\n\n**•** **SHORTBENCH A downloader used to download and execute shellcode to**\n\ndownload and install additional malware and tools. It is a simple, lightweight\nand open-sourced framework. SHORTBENCH can be used to download virtually\nany follow-on payload and has been observed in use by diverse actors in a wide\nrange of event types.\n\n**•** **QAKBOT A complex and full-featured modular stealthy banking trojan first seen**\n\nin 2008. It has worm-like propagation capabilities and anti-analysis features.\nQakbot is typically delivered via phishing email, exploit kit, removable drive and\ninfected web pages. The malware is typically used to steal sensitive information,\nsuch as banking and email credentials. Financial targets and other targeted\ndomains and blacklisted sites are hard-coded into the malware. We saw a sharp\ndecline in the use of QAKBOT in the last year.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11.**\nStrings from\ndeployment BAT\nfiles.\n\n\n###### Monetizing Ransomware\n\nThe successful monetization of ransomware attacks and the availability of\nransomware as a service have contributed to an increase in ransomware cases.\nIt has also led some established cyber crime groups to turn to ransomware as a\nsecondary means of generating revenue. In 2019 we saw several cases in which\nthreat actors that historically targeted sensitive information such as personally\nidentifiable information (PII) and credit card information turned to ransomware to\nmonetize access to victim networks.\n\n###### FIN6\nIn one case, FIN6, a cyber crime group known to target payment card information,\nwas identified operating inside a company in the engineering sector. The\npresence of FIN6 in an engineering company with no connection to payment card\ninformation seemed odd. The Mandiant investigation revealed that the attacker\nwas in the early stages of a deploying LockerGoga. Using domain administrator\ncredentials, the attacker ran batch files containing psexec commands to connect\nto remote systems and deploy LockerGoga. The batch scripts (Fig. 11) executed\nLockerGoga as the service “mstdc,” which was likely the attacker’s attempt to\nmasquerade as the legitimate Windows service “msdtc.” The batch files used by\nthe attacker followed the naming convention “xaa.bat”, “xab.bat”, “xac.bat” and\nso on.\n\n\nstart copy svchost.exe \\\\10.1.1.1\\c$\\windows\\temp\\start psexec.exe \\\\10.1.1.1\n-u domain\\domainadmin -p “password” -d -h -r mstdc -s -accepteula -nobanner\nc:\\windows\\temp\\svchost.exe\n\n\nMandiant analysts linked the tools and attacker infrastructure to other FIN6\nactivity, and eventually concluded that FIN6 had expanded to using ransomware to\nfurther monetize their access to compromised environments.\n\n###### UNC1733\nIn 2019, UNC1733 targeted a retailer and tried to obtain payment card information\nfrom the point-of-sale (POS) environment. The attacker gained access to the\nenvironment by exploiting the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability in a public-facing\nSharePoint server. The exploit allowed the attacker to access the system and\nlaunch a Cobalt Strike backdoor. After performing reconnaissance and lateral\nmovement, the attacker obtained domain administrator privileges by harvesting\ncredentials from systems in the environment. The attacker then began attempting\nto obtain payment card information from the POS environment. To support their\nefforts, the attacker deployed TRINITY and WETLINK to obtain payment card\ninformation from the memory of POS systems. Both attempts failed because\nthe victim organization was using point-to-point encryption. Within 24 hours of\nfailing to acquire payment card information, the attacker changed tactics and\nused Cobalt Strike backdoors deployed to non-POS servers to load an unknown\nransomware variant. The ransomware was in-memory only and could not be\nrecovered, but documents and database files were encrypted. The newly created\nfilenames had the name of the victim organization appended to them.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 12.**\nCommon elements\nof crimeware\nmarketplace\nofferings.\n\n\n###### Conclusion\nGiven the ease at which ransomware attacks can be carried out and the willingness\nof victims to pay, FireEye has assessed that threat groups will continue to\nleverage ransomware as a secondary means for monetizing their access to victim\nenvironments.\n\n###### Crimeware as a Service\n\nProfit-motivated cyber criminals are known to outsource elements of their\noperations to counterparts operating in underground communities. There are\nseveral common elements of malicious campaigns, corresponding marketplace\nofferings and notable trends surrounding this issue (Fig. 12).\n\n\nExamples of Common Elements of Malicious Campaigns\n\n\n**Payload Delivery**\n\n- Access Sales\n\n- Pay-per-Install Services\n\n- Exploit Kit Rental\n\n\n**Malware**\n\n- Source Code\n\n- Malware Builder\n\n- Malware-as-a-Service\n\n\nSample of Corresponding Marketplace Offerings\n\n\nThe level of access that an actor \u0003advertises\nis the most influential price \u0003factor, although\nsome trends in industry \u0003were also observed.\n\n\nActors continue advertising ransomware\n\u0003affiliate programs. These actors typically\n\u0003look for multiple partners who can distribute\nransomware in diversified ways \u0003such as\nthrough spam, RDP and network \u0003access.\n\n\n**Monetization**\n\n- Bank Drops\n\n- Credit Card Shops\n\nStolen payment card data is commonly\nmonetized through card shops. Various\nfactors can influence pricing of payment card\ninformation, including the data’s freshness,\nthe region from which the payment card\ndata was collected, and each card’s average\nassociated value.\n\n\nAccess Advertisement Trends\n\n\nMonetization Trends\n\n\nTechnology ($32,465)\n\n\n$22 $34 $28 $39 $39 $39 $27\n\n\nPrice of accesses and market share, by industry. Average price of payment card information, by region.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 13.**\nTruncated event\nlog associated\nwith execution\nof MetaSploit\nreverse shell.\n\n\nThe use of tool or service providers allows cyber criminals to increase the speed\nat which they monetize an operation. The use of such providers was evident\nthroughout the financially motivated operations investigated by Mandiant\nconsultants in 2019. Common examples included:\n\n- Attackers using malware that was available for purchase\n\n- Use of card shops to sell stolen payment card data\n\n- Victim PII offered for sale in criminal forums\n\n- Access to victim networks offered for sale in criminal forums\n\n###### Case Study: FIN6 Targets Point-of-Sale Systems\nIn one case, a victim was targeted with a military recruiting-themed phishing\nemail containing a link to a remotely hosted ZIP file. The ZIP file contained a\nmalicious payload that ultimately loaded an instance of SQUIDSLEEP, a JavaScript\ndownloader that was then used to install the SQUIDGATE backdoor. Throughout\nthe compromise, SQUIDGATE was used to execute PowerShell commands to\nlaunch a Metasploit reverse-shell (Fig. 13). SQUIDGATE is a malware family sold by\nan actor operating in a reputable, Russian-language forum. The attacker moved\nacross the environment using Metasploit and privileged credentials obtained\nearlier in the intrusion. Our tracking of the malware service provider and resultant\ncampaigns enabled us to attribute this operation to FIN6-motivated intrusions\nthroughout 2020.\n\n\nA service was installed in the system.

SCRAPMINT is used by several threat actors that use disparate tactics, techniques\nand procedures. We have not observed SCRAPMINT as publicly available, so it may be\noffered by private providers or shared among a group of attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 1.**\nAttacker\ncommands.\n\n**Command**\n\nfor /f %%i in (C:\\Windows\\Temp\\\ndpllist.log) do net use \\\\%%i\\c$ /\nuser:\"<REDACTED>\\<REDACTED>\"\n<REDACTED>\n\ntype \\\\%%i\\c$\\Windows\\Temp\\silconfig1.dat\n>> C:\\Windows\\Temp\\tmplog.dat\n\ncopy psemon10.dll \\\\%%i\\c$\\Windows\\Temp\\\npsemon10.dll /Y\n\ncopy cfgx.bat \\\\%%i\\c$\\Windows\\Temp\\cfgx.\nbat /Y\n\nping 127.0.0.1 -n 1\n\ndel \\\\%%i\\c$\\Windows\\Temp\\silconfig1.dat\n\nprocess call create \"cmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\\nTemp\\cfgx.bat\n\necho %%i >> C:\\Windows\\Temp\\proclog.csv\n\nnet use \\\\%%i\\c$ /delete\n\n**Figure 14.**\nBatch script used to\ndeploy SCRAPMINT\n(cfgx.bat).\n\n\nThe attacker used a batch script to execute the following commands, attacker\ncommands (Table 1), which deployed SCRAPMINT and pulled back files containing\npayment card information.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nRead in a list of hostnames from the file “dpllist.log” and mapped a network drive to the remote\nsystem.\n\nRead the content of “silconfig1.dat” on the remote system and copied it to the file “tmplog.dat”\non the POS server.

As the attacker identified POS terminals where\npayment card information was accessible, they were also able to identify the\nnaming scheme for POS terminals with hosts that had point-to-point encryption\nenabled. Following their discovery, the attacker deployed SCRAPMINT to 150 POS\nterminals–almost none of which were protected by point-to-point encryption.\nThe following month, the attacker attempted to deploy SCRAPMINT to hundreds\nof additional POS terminals that also did not have point-to-point encryption\nimplemented.\n\nFor the duration of the compromise, the attacker periodically returned to\nthe environment to copy and transfer payment card information out of the\nenvironment through the SQUIDGATE backdoor. The data from this incident\nappeared to be monetized through Joker’s Stash, a well-known card data shop\nthat our analysts have seen used by prolific threat actors such as FIN6 and FIN7.\n\n###### A Win-Win\nUnderground communities allow malicious threat actors to establish relationships\nthat are mutually beneficial. Threat actors can specialize in specific tasks or types\nof activity to achieve a greater overall impact when working together. For example,\nan individual who is a skilled coder doesn’t need to also have expertise on money\nlaundering or malware distribution. An intrusion operator doesn’t necessarily need\nto expend time and resources developing malware, standing up infrastructure,\nor worrying about how they can cash out stolen goods; instead, they can focus\nexclusively on active intrusion operations. As a result, it is likely that more skilled\noperators will be able to pivot through networks more quickly and ultimately\nincrease the velocity and scale of their operations. We expect these types of\nbusiness relationships to continue enabling financially motivated intrusions\nthroughout 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threats From Within\n\nOver the past year, FireEye Mandiant teams responded to an increasing number\nof incidents in which malicious insiders destroyed critical business systems,\nleaked confidential data, stalked employees and extorted and blackmailed the\norganizations they worked for. Some of the insiders were involved in economic\nespionage, some were motivated by greed and others vandalized their employer.\n\nConsequently, organizations are increasingly paying attention to the business risk\nand impact of insider threats. Some malicious insiders brought public attention\nto their misdeeds by leaking data, broadcasting demands or making threats.\nConversely, we saw some malicious insiders initially remain private, demanding\nmoney to prevent the release of stolen data. Some insiders acted with stealth to\nsteal research data or intellectual property. The increasing number of incidents is\nparticularly troubling for organizations of all sizes and missions because insiders\nare, by definition, those we normally trust most.\n\nMandiant engagements included investigations of malicious insiders who\nwere third-party contractors, current employees and past employees. The\nroles they played included contract staff, IT admins, individual contributors,\nlawyers, academics and senior executives. Their true goals included stalking,\nblackmail, extortion, intellectual property theft and sabotage. The insider incident\ninvestigations were complex and solved through a combination of technical\nforensic analysis and traditional non-cyber investigative techniques.\n\nLike traditional targeted attacks by external threat actors, malicious insider attacks\nare often carried out over time, with the insider usually taking steps to try to hide\ntheir malicious activity and remain undetected in the victim environment. And even\nwhen their malicious activity is detected, these insiders have sometimes taken\nsteps to divert culpability through the use of other employees’ accounts.\n\nMalicious insider incidents are likely to become an increasing trend given that\nthey involve trusted access, high impact and low cost to execute, combined with\norganizational cultures with open trust models. In addition, we have seen the rise\nof successful extortion incidents that have been publicized.\n\nFour types of insider threat—extortion, economic espionage, asset destruction,\nworkplace stalking—appeared to trend with FireEye clients in 2019.\n\n###### Trend 1: Extortion\nMandiant investigators observed an increasing number of insiders engaging\nin digital extortion schemes. Most often, the insiders attempted to extort their\norganization by threatening to publicly release stolen data if a monetary demand\nwas not met. The ransom demand often demanded payment in a decentralized\ndigital currency such as Bitcoin.\n\nThe ransom demand amount was usually commensurate with the perceived value\nof the stolen data. This helped ensure companies would consider payment. If the\ndemanded amount was too large, the attacker would likely not get paid.\n\nMost of the insider extortion cases we responded to followed a common approach.\nThe attacker sent an email to a company executive indicating that some amount of\nsensitive data was stolen, provided proof of the possession of the stolen data and\nstated that the data would be released publicly on a certain date unless a payment\nwas made.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttributing an extortion demand to an insider is complicated. An organization\nneeds to determine if the extortion demand is real by determining if the data is\nauthentic. If the data is authentic, the organization needs to understand where\nthe data came from and how it was obtained. A broad investigation of the\nenvironment is sometimes required to determine who may be behind the incident.\n\n_When authentic data accompanies an extortion demand, organizations_\n_must ask:_\n\n_•_ _Did the data come from inside the organization?_\n\n_•_ _Is there evidence of an intrusion and was the data stolen?_\n\n_•_ _Were legitimate credentials used to access the data, and if so, were those_\n\n_credentials stolen by a threat actor or used by the employee?_\n\nSometimes an extortionist attempts to deceive the victim organization. In one\ncase, an extortionist demanding money claimed to be an outside attacker that was\ncollaborating with an insider. We later learned the extortionist was an employee\ntrying to frame a coworker. In another situation, the extortionist claimed to have\ncompromised the credentials of an employee. This was likely an attempt by the\ninsider to create an alibi in case they were later caught.\n\nThere are several competing priorities in an insider investigation. An organization\nmust validate the risk exposure, establish and execute a communication strategy\nwith the extortionist and prevent further access to the network—all while under an\naggressive threat actor-imposed deadline. Immediate determination of whether an\nincident was caused by an internal or external actor is not often possible without a\nproper forensic investigation.\n\nThe obvious next question is whether a victim organization should pay the demand.\nEach scenario is unique and needs to be approached differently. Even if a victim\norganization pays the demand, there is always a chance the attacker will release\nthe data anyway to media, social networking platforms, file sharing sites and\nunderground forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Trend 2: Economic Espionage\nMandiant experts observed significant intellectual property research theft by\ninsiders, including some potentially associated with China’s Thousand Talents\nprogram. China’s program has been the subject of debate. In 2019, the United\nStates Senate, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Committee on\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs published a report that stated,\n“Launched in 2008, the Thousand Talents Plan incentivizes individuals engaged\nin research and development in the United States to transmit the knowledge and\nresearch they gain here to China in exchange for monetary payments… China\nunfairly uses the American [funded] research and expertise it obtains for [China’s]\nown economic and military gain.”1\n\nIn one case, an organization hired PhD scientists with ties to China to support a research project. As part\nof the scientific team, the organization provided access to years of sensitive research materials, experiment\ndata and findings from other researchers. The scientists were hired to materially and meaningfully\ncontribute to the research and collaborate with the team. The research model supported full access to all data, and IT\npolicies provided few security controls to authorized users or to their devices. The research team noted few research\ncontributions and a lack of participation with the research team’s efforts. The research team did notice the scientists\nspent a lot of time by themselves pouring through the data. Through forensic analysis, it was determined that the\nscientists installed a Chinese cloud-based file storage application on their laptops. Using their authorized access to\nsensitive data and intellectual property, the scientists uploaded significant volumes of sensitive research into a cloud\n\n###### Trend 3: Asset Destruction\nMandiant responders were engaged by a client at which an executive had received\nan extortion message via an anonymous email. The attacker had indicated that\nthey possessed access to the client’s internal network and had the ability to cause\noutages. A significant payment was demanded in Bitcoin. As proof, the attacker\nreferred to an unexplained outage of a critical security system that occurred a few\nweeks earlier.\n\nMandiant analysts identified evidence to suggest that the outage of the security\nsystem had occurred as a result of malicious actions by an insider where the root\naccount was used to delete several critical operating system files, rendering the\nsecurity service unavailable. Analysis of more than 20 different log sources led\nto identifying the insider. Forensic analysis identified malicious SSH connections\nfrom an unauthorized device to Linux servers hosting a critical security service.\nThe /var/log/secure authentication log file was recovered from one of the server’s\ndeleted space and allowed Mandiant investigators to identify the RSA key used\nby the attacker to connect to the system. The investigators determined that\nthe malicious insider, just prior to engaging in malicious actions, had disabled\nendpoint protection on his workstation and masked his behavior by using VMware\nwith guest systems in bridge mode. Mandiant analysts also identified evidence\nof destructive actions against critical production systems by analyzing the\nvirtual machines stored on the employee’s workstation. Forensic analysis of the\nemployee’s workstation showed the execution of anti-forensic programs.\n\n[1 U.S. Senate (November 18, 2019). Threats to the U.S. Research Enterprise: China’s Talent Recruitment Plans.](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2019-11-18%20PSI%20Staff%20Report%20-%20China's%20Talent%20Recruitment%20Plans%20Updated.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Trend 4: Workplace Stalking\nIn one case, Mandiant experts were called in after a client received alerts from\ntheir digital loss prevention solution that indicated an employee was trying to copy\nsensitive customer files to a USB drive. The organization noted other user accounts\nlogging into the employee’s system regularly. Camera footage showed the\nemployee was the only person there at the time of the logins; the employees who\nappeared to be logging in were not at work. During the investigation, keylogging\ndata was found in a log.txt file stored in one of the employee’s directories named\n“dumps,” which focused the investigation towards a physical keylogger. Corporate\nemail searches showed receipts for purchases of keylogging devices in the\nemployee’s name. Analysis of the log.txt files found other employee usernames\nand passwords, which validated how the employee had access to other employee’s\nuser accounts. Further analysis showed that the employee gained access to over\n30 other user accounts over a multi-year period. The employee used this account\naccess to view personal employee information such as salaries. The employee\nalso engaged in cyberstalking behaviors against several female employees. The\nemployee read their emails, obtained their personal user account credentials and\ngathered photos of them. Mandiant investigators were able to gather enough\nrelevant information via the user’s Outlook Personal Storage Table (.pst) email\nfiles to show the employee had emailed their keylogging files directly from their\nbusiness account to their personal accounts. The investigation also identified\nadditional stalking materials in backups of the employee’s home directory.\n\n###### Conclusion\nOrganizations across the world are investing more resources to detect and protect\ntheir most critical assets and crown jewels from malicious insiders. Unfortunately, in\nmany cases, these investments come after an event which caused organizational,\nbrand or reputational harm. The impact of an insider betraying an organization’s\ntrust can be devastating for organizations of all sizes. We expect to see this trend\nto continue into 2020 and beyond.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CASE STUDY\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Gift Cards in the Crosshairs\n\nIn 2019, Mandiant experts responded to intrusions we assessed with a high-level\nof confidence to be evolving FIN9 intrusions. These were notable due to the\nattacker’s shift to targeting IT service providers. This increased their impact and\nreach across multiple organizations compared to past activity. The attackers\nexpanded their monetization actions by targeting corporate reward systems to\nsteal gift cards. Finally, the attackers continue to expand and evolve their toolset\nwith a distinct focus on publicly available tools and compromised legitimate\naccess. Mandiant analysts expect to see these efforts continue due to their\nlucrative nature and favorable attacker outcomes.\n\n###### The Value of Targeting Gift Cards\n\nThe flexible characteristics of gift cards make them attractive to actors for use in\nfinancially-motivated operations. Gift cards can be used in many different venues\nand are easy to monetize through resale or by making direct purchases. The\nexistence of public marketplaces that allow individuals to exchange gift cards\ndirectly for Bitcoin also provides malicious actors a quick, anonymous way to\ncash out. Also, gift card processing generally does not require the use of PII, and\ngift card breaches are tracked differently than the more well-established PII/PCI\nmaterial. This alters organizations’ reporting requirements and, in practice, may\nmean that at least some organizations have established less robust measures to\nprevent the fraudulent use of gift cards.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 15.**\nSample phishing\nemail received by IT\nservice provider.\n\n\n###### First Stage: Targeting IT Service Providers\n\nInvestigations pursued by Mandiant professionals suggested the attackers\nprimarily obtained initial access to IT service providers using credentials\ncollected through phishing campaigns. In one case, over 50 individuals received a\nphishing email claiming to be an encrypted message from the organization’s HR\ndepartment. The phishing email was created using a legitimate email marketing\nplatform. Credentials obtained through this phishing campaign were then used to\nlog into the organization’s IT service management portal, and later used to attempt\nauthentication to Office365 email inboxes. All authentication attempts to the\norganization’s O365 environment were made from network nodes associated with\na commercial VPN service.\n\nThe embedded link in the phishing email (Fig. 15) mimicked those created by\nlegitimate secure email portals, but directed users to a phishing kit. The phishing\nkit was hosted at organization-specific subdomains of the attacker-controlled\ndomain internal-message[.]app. This phishing page was built using resources from\nthe publicly available LUCY Phishing Software platform.\n\n|You have received an encrypted message from HR Department Some of the content in this message couldn’t be downloaded because you’re working offline or aren’t connected to a network. *** DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL *** Dear The HR Department has sent you an encrypted message. You can access it under the following link: https:// /internal-message/a34fc9f417efef3c2 Please sign in with your network username and password to decrypt the message. Thank You! Ref:MSG13128387|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\nYou have received an encrypted message from HR Department\n\n\nThank You!\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Second Stage: Operations\n\n Initial Access / Establish Foothold\nIn several incident responses handled by Mandiant professionals, the attackers\nused these compromised legitimate credentials as initial access into victim\norganizations. While the attacker possessed multiple accounts with elevated\nprivileges, they did not use them in any specific way. Instead, the attacker would\noften attempt to access legitimate VPN architecture in the early phases of the\nintrusion (Fig. 16). This implies a preference for pre-determined intrusion steps\ninstead of adapting based on what they possessed from earlier intrusion actions.\nWe suspect this preference is due to expanding their footprint as valid users by\naccessing the victim through trusted corporate infrastructure.\n\n\n**Figure 16.**\nGift card attack\nlifecycle.\n\n|Maintain Presence Move Laterally • ScreenConnect • EMCO Remote Installer • CleverControl • SentryPC • Teramind • Virtual Network Computing (VNC) • Splashtop Streamer Initial Compromise/Establish Foothold Internal Reconnaissance Complete Mission|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|||||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Maintain Presence / Lateral Movement\nThe attacker primarily used both the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\nand a variety of legitimate and publicly available tools to maintain persistence\nand move laterally within victim environments. ScreenConnect, EMCO Remote\nInstaller and Splashtop Streamer were among the list of tools commonly used\nto both establish persistence and move laterally within the victim environments.\nIn intrusions observed throughout 2018, the attacker also used other publicly\navailable remote access tools including CleverControl, SentryPC, Teramind and\nVirtual Network Computing (VNC). While there is some variance in tool use\nbetween 2018 and 2019, all these tools effectively belong to the same category.\nThe tools may have been selected due to a range of factors, including their prior\nexistence in a victim environment or operator preference.\n\n###### Internal Reconnaissance / Privilege Escalation\nTo collect credentials and conduct reconnaissance, the attackers used\nProcDump, PsExec, and Mimikatz. Credentials obtained enabled further internal\nreconnaissance efforts, and supported end-stage operations. In multiple victim\nnetworks, after obtaining appropriate administrative credentials, the attacker\nused the O365 eDiscovery portal to perform keyword searches of emails and\nstickynotes looking for messages relating to gift cards and credit cards, and for\nevidence of administrative passwords sent via email. In at least one case, this same\nmethodology was employed in an earlier stage of the operation to search emails\nfor documentation or credentials related to corporate VPN access.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 17.**\nAttacker subverting\nemployee rewards\nsystem.\n\n\n###### End-Stage Operations: Gift Card Targeting\n\nConsistent with prior FIN9 operations, some compromised organizations had their\nvalid process for issuing gift cards subverted to create fraudulent gift cards for\nthe attacker (Fig. 17). In other instances, the compromised organization was not\nin the gift card supply chain, but the attacker was still able to obtain gift cards\nby exploiting corporate employee rewards systems. In one case, after harvesting\nuser credentials, the attacker submitted employee award nominations and then\napproved them from approver-privileged accounts that were also compromised.\nThese employee rewards points were then traded in for gift cards.\n\n###### Conclusion\nAttacks like this highlight organizations’ need to mitigate risks associated with\nusing managed IT service providers, which involves threats not unique to any one\nthreat actor. This means treating accounts, systems and services managed by\nthird parties with additional scrutiny and monitoring for any associated anomalous\nbehavior. From a detection perspective, this threat actor regularly performs\nreconnaissance of victim environments using their Office 365 eDiscovery portals.\nQueries from this portal can be monitored for any effort to look for credentials\nor search for systems or services relating to the management of gift cards. The\nattacker’s use of compromised legitimate credentials reinforces the importance of\nimplanting multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CLOUD SECURITY\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Breaching the Cloud\n\n Technology Subversion\n\nMost of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) intrusions encountered in Mandiant\nIncident Response engagements begin with compromised credentials, usually\nin the form of an AWS access key or an identity and access management (IAM)\nuser password. An AWS access key consists of a unique public identifier and\na corresponding private (secret) key, which are, analogous to a username and\npassword respectively. Used together, a user can perform API requests against\nAWS services or access the AWS environment via the AWS command line\ninterface (CLI). The CLI allows a user to modify and manage resources. Since\nthe keys are designed to enable applications to access an AWS environment,\norganizations typically do not enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\nIn one Mandiant Incident Response case, AWS access keys were compromised\nfrom a GitHub repository and leveraged to access the victim’s AWS\nenvironment.\n\n###### First Stage: Targeting GitHub Repository\n\nInvestigations into the early stages of the attack suggested the attacker initially\nobtained credentials to the victim’s GitHub code repository, which was not\nprotected by MFA. Once the attacker was able to gain access to the GitHub\nrepository with a known account, the attacker acquired a set of IAM user access\nkeys by searching the commit history. The IAM user access keys were used as\nlong-lived credentials for applications that interacted with and performed API\nrequests against AWS services in the victim’s environment.\n\n###### Second Stage: Initial Access / Reconnaissance / Establish Foothold\nAfter the attacker acquired the IAM access keys, they were able to access the\nvictim’s AWS environment using the AWS CLI from a virtual server located in\nthe Netherlands. The attacker then utilized the AWS CLI to interact with the\nAWS environment (Table 2).\n\n\n###### Breaching the Cloud\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 2.**\nReconnaissance\ncommands\nexecuted by\nattacker.\n\n|Command aws s3api list-buckets aws ec2 describe-instances aws ec2 describe-security-groups aws ec2 describe-snapshots aws ec2 describe-volumes aws ec2 describe-db-instances|Description Lists all S3 buckets in a region Lists all of the ec2 instances Describes all or specified security groups Describe all snapshots available or snapshots available to user Describes all or specified Elastic Block Store volumes Describes all or specified AWS account instances|\n|---|---|\n\n\n###### Third Stage: Maintain Presence / Move Laterally / Complete Mission\nAfter performing reconnaissance and not finding information of interest, the\nattacker provisioned a new IAM user account with both AWS Management\nConsole and programmatic access. This meant they no longer needed to rely on\nthe access key obtained from the GitHub repository. Shortly after authenticating to\nthe console, the attacker took snapshots of nine of the largest Elastic Block Store\n(EBS) volumes within the AWS account. After successfully creating snapshots\nof the large EBS volumes, the attacker proceeded to create a new EC2 instance,\nmounted the snapshots, and attached an existing security policy to the EC2\ninstance that allowed inbound and outbound traffic on port 22.\n\nThe attacker then authenticated to the EC2 instance to review the contents of the\nnine attached EBS volumes. Within an hour, the VPC flow logs recorded a large\nvolume of data being transferred via SSH to the virtual server in the Netherlands.\nThis was the first recorded high-volume data transfer via SSH, and it corresponded\nto the first data theft by the attacker. Shortly after the data transfer, the EBS\nsnapshots were unmounted from the instance and deleted from the account.\n\nThe attacker then targeted the victim’s AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)\ninstances. Specifically, the attacker targeted the MySQL database containing\nuser credentials for a service provided by the victim organization. VPC flow logs\nrecorded traffic between the attacker’s EC2 instance and the RDS database. Again,\na high volume of data was transferred between the two systems, and subsequently\ntransferred to the virtual server in the Netherlands. This was consistent with the\nattacker staging data on their EC2 instance and then transferring it to their server\nin the Netherlands.\n\nOnce the attacker had successfully transferred the data, the attacker terminated\nthe EC2 instance. This removed valuable forensic artifacts because the EC2\ninstance was not recoverable. The attacker did not remove the attacker-created\ncredentials, which would have permitted them to access additional data in the\ndatabase or EBS volumes.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Summary\nAWS and other CSPs enable organizations to rapidly develop, scale and deploy\ncode and systems. Once an attacker obtains credentials to a cloud infrastructure,\nthe same tools that empower the organization also enable the attacker to rapidly\ntarget and exploit cloud environments. The ability to access these cloud-native\ntools also removes the need for sophisticated backdoors or custom tooling.\nEverything the attacker needs is publicly accessible and provided by the CSP,\nusually in the form of a CLI.\n\n###### Common Weaknesses and Best Practices\n\n MFA not enforced on GitHub repository user accounts or\n for AWS IAM users\n\n Pitfall Attackers target code repositories to gather pertinent information about a\ncorporation’s cloud or on-premise environment, and to obtain credentials. In at least\none case, multi-factor authentication was not enforced for the victim’s user accounts\non GitHub repository. The victim also had console password enabled for an IAM user\nwithout enforcing MFA.\n\n###### Best Practice Organizations should enforce MFA for all user accounts that have\naccess to code repositories and AWS accounts. Enabling and enforcing MFA will\nenhance the overall security of these accounts and reduce the risk that an attacker\nwill be able to use a compromised account for nefarious activity. An organization\nshould disable any inactive IAM users until MFA is enabled.\n\nThe second factor may be a hard or soft token. Organizations should avoid using\nsecond-factor mechanisms that are stored on the user’s PC. Instead, consider soft\ntokens that are deployed onto mobile devices.\n\nFor additional hardening, organizations should require MFA not only for console\naccess, but also for CLI access. Organizations should restrict both console and CLI\naccess to known trusted IP ranges or IP addresses.\n\n###### Long-lived IAM Credentials\n\n Pitfall While long-lived IAM user credentials are used for application functionality,\nsuch user access keys can increase the attack surface of an organization’s AWS\nenvironment.\n\n###### Best Practice Organizations should rotate IAM user access keys every 90 days to\nlimit attacker access to AWS. When developing an application, IAM roles should be\nused to retrieve temporary credentials to interact with AWS resources within the\nenvironment. AWS provides features to reduce the use of long-lived IAM credentials\nfor application purposes in their cloud platform. An organization should be using\nIAM roles for EC2 instance profiles if they intend to have an application on an\nEC2 instance interact with different AWS services, such as S3, Lambda functions,\nRelational Database Service.\n\nUsing IAM roles rather than IAM access keys to perform AWS API requests has\nmultiple benefits. Once transitioned, an organization’s AWS administrator will\nnot be required to rotate credentials, because the AWS EC2 service will pass\ntemporary credentials to the metadata service of the underlying EC2 instance.\nAWS rotates the credentials in the EC2 metadata service every one to six hours.\nAs an added benefit, an organization can easily restrict which role an IAM user can\nassign to an EC2 instance profile during the launch process to prevent the user\nfrom gaining elevated privileges.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Overly permissive IAM roles\n\n Pitfall When IAM user accounts have an overly permissive IAM role, they are at\nrisk for both inadvertent or deliberate activity outside of their intended purpose or\nscope. In at least one instance, a compromised account has been observed with the\nAdministrator Access policy attached, which granted full administrative access to\nthe AWS account.\n\n###### Best Practice Organizations should follow the principle of least privilege\nwhen assigning IAM users and roles. To abide by the principle of least privilege,\norganizations should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM\nrole that has administrative privileges. An organization should strive to reduce all\npermanent privileged role assignments and conduct periodic entitlement reviews\non IAM users, roles and policies. AWS provides native services, such as AWS access\nadvisor to audit IAM roles for service access, assist with removal of unnecessary\npermissions and set appropriate permissions across different environments.\n\n###### Insufficient detection capabilities Pitfall Organizations may have insufficient detection capabilities and SIEM use\ncases established at the time of an incident.\n\n###### Best Practice Organizations should develop SIEM use cases to help detect threats\nimpacting cloud assets and services. An organization should identify the most\ncommon targeted threats impacting the AWS environment, and identify activity in\nAWS that would be considered anomalous. The use cases should sufficiently cover a\nvariety of assets and services.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Storing credentials in plaintext within a GitHub repository\n\n Pitfall Organizations may not be scanning for exposed credentials or preventing\nthem from being committed to the GitHub code repository.\n\n###### Best Practice Organizations should use a professional or open-source credential\nscanning solution to monitor and prevent inadvertent exposure of credentials.\nGitHub provides a professional token scanning solution that will analyze code for\nexposed credentials. The GitHub token scanning service will allow an organization\nto create regular expressions to match specific credential patterns and then alert\nthe user or security team after a credential has been committed.\n\nGitHub Enterprise can create pre-receive hooks, which allow a script or credential\nscanning tool to be executed before acceptance of the commit. An organization\ncan use these pre-receive hooks and webhooks to execute an open-source\ntool such as “git-secrets” or “detect-secrets” before allowing the commit, to\nprevent any code containing an exposed secret from being accepted into a code\nrepository.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CONCLUSION\n\n\n-----\n\n###### M-Trends 2020 Takeaways\n\nWhile the threat landscape is evolving, new is not replacing old. Although we have\nobserved new malware families, many of these attackers are the usual suspects we\nhave seen over the years using familiar types of attack techniques with malware\nbased on a handful of known malware families.\n\nAnd these threats and activities never stop. There are more active groups now\nthan ever before, with significant APT and FIN activity. These groups are using a\ncombination of custom intrusion tools and publicly available tools, typically in the\nsame parts of the attacker lifecycle.\n\nWhile targeted industries and overall motivations have remained consistent, we are\nseeing a marked expansion of threat actor goals, including new ways to monetize\nintrusions and overall diversification in threat activity. This requires incident\nresponders to be prepared for more scenarios, both familiar and unfamiliar.\n\nPerhaps most importantly is the good news: attacks are being detected and\nresponded to more quickly. The global median dwell time for 2019 was 56 days—\nless than two months! Also of note: more victims were notified by an outside\nparty, reversing a four-year trend where more organizations were identifying\ncompromises on their own.\n\nMany of the stats in M-Trends 2020 show that both the industry and\norganizations are getting better at cyber security, but there is no single reason\nwhy. Perhaps more vendors and more awareness are leading to better visibility\nacross the security spectrum. Or organizations are simply investing more in their\ncyber security programs.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne thing is for certain: cyber investments will fall short of achieving the desired\nsecurity outcomes if security staff are not properly trained. Security effectiveness\nvalidation using purple team and red team exercises is one of the best ways for\norganizations to evaluate and test their security. By going up against real-world\nattackers, security teams can assess their own ability to detect and respond to an\nactive attacker scenario. Response readiness assessments and incident response\ntabletop exercises also help improve preparedness. These exercises expose\nexecutives, legal personnel and other staff to incident response processes and\nconcepts, and let participants know what actions they need to take during\na typical intrusion scenario.\n\nAnd of course, FireEye will continue to publish M-Trends in the years to come, to\nimprove our collective security awareness, knowledge and capabilities.\n\n\nOne thing is for certain: cyber investments will fall short of achieving the desired\nsecurity outcomes if security staff are not properly trained.
