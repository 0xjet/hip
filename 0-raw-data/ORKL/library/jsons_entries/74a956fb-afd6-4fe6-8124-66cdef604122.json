Stitch is ONLY intended to be used on your own pentesting labs, or**\n**with explicit consent from the owner of the property being tested.**\n\n## About Stitch\n\nA Cross Platform Python Remote Administration Tool:\n\nThis is a cross platform python framework which allows you to build custom payloads for\nWindows, Mac OSX and Linux as well. You are able to select whether the payload binds to a\nspecific IP and port, listens for a connection on a port, option to send an email of system info\nwhen the system boots, and option to start keylogger on boot. Payloads created can only run\non the OS that they were created on.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Features\n\n### Cross Platform Support\n\nCommand and file auto-completion\nAntivirus detection\nAble to turn off/on display monitors\nHide/unhide files and directories\nView/edit the hosts file\nView all the systems environment variables\nKeylogger with options to view status, start, stop and dump the logs onto your host\nsystem\nView the location and other information of the target machine\nExecute custom python scripts which return whatever you print to screen\nScreenshots\nVirtual machine detection\nDownload/Upload files to and from the target system\nAttempt to dump the systems password hashes\nPayloads' properties are \"disguised\" as other known programs\n\n### Windows Specific\n\nDisplay a user/password dialog box to obtain user password\nDump passwords saved via Chrome\nClear the System, Security, and Application logs\nEnable/Disable services such as RDP,UAC, and Windows Defender\nEdit the accessed, created, and modified properties of files\nCreate a custom popup box\nView connected webcam and take snapshots\nView past connected wifi connections along with their passwords\nView information about drives connected\nView summary of registry values such as DEP\n\n### Mac OSX Specific\n\nDisplay a user/password dialog box to obtain user password\nChange the login text at the user's login screen\nWebcam snapshots\n\n### Mac OSX/Linux Specific\n\nSSH from the target machine into another host\nRun sudo commands\nAttempt to bruteforce the user's password using the passwords list found in Tools/\n\n\n-----\n\nWebcam snapshots? (untested on Linux)\n\n## Implemented Transports\n\nAll communication between the host and target is AES encrypted. Every Stitch program\ngenerates an AES key which is then put into all payloads. To access a payload the AES keys\nmust match. To connect from a different system running Stitch you must add the key by using\nthe showkey command from the original system and the addkey command on the new\nsystem.\n\n## Implemented Payload Installers\n\n[The \"stitchgen\" command gives the user the option to create NSIS installers on Windows](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)\n[and Makeself installers on posix machines. For Windows, the installer packages the payload](http://stephanepeter.com/makeself/)\nand an elevation exe,which prevents the firewall prompt and adds persistence, and places\nthe payload on the system. For Mac OSX and Linux, the installer places the payload and\n[attempts to add persistence. To create NSIS installers you must download and install NSIS.](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download)\n\n## Wiki\n\n[Crash Course of Stitch](https://github.com/nathanlopez/Stitch/wiki/Crash-Course)\n\n## Requirements\n\n[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\nFor easy installation run the following command that corresponds to your OS:\n```\n# for Windows\npip install -r win_requirements.txt\n# for Mac OSX\npip install -r osx_requirements.txt\n# for Linux\npip install -r lnx_requirements.txt\n\n```\n[Pycrypto](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto)\n[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)\n[Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama)\n[PIL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PIL)\n\n### Windows Specific\n\n[Py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/)\n[pywin32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mac OSX Specific\n\n[PyObjC](https://pythonhosted.org/pyobjc/)\n\n### Mac OSX/Linux Specific\n\n[PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/)\n[pexpect](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n\n## To Run\n```\npython main.py\nor\n./main.py\n\n Motivation\n\n```\nMy motivation behind this was to advance my knowledge of python, hacking, and just to see\nwhat I could accomplish. Was somewhat discouraged and almost abandoned this project\n[when I found the amazing work done by n1nj4sec, but still decided to put this up since I had](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy)\nalready come so far.\n\n## Other open-source Python RATs for Reference\n\n[vesche/basicRAT](https://github.com/vesche/basicRAT)\n[n1nj4sec/pupy](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy)\n\n## Screenshots\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## License\n\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/nathanlopez/Stitch/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n\n-----",
