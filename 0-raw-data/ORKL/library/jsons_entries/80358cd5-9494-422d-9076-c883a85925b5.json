Information is processed for investigative and intelligence purposes for law enforcement and public awareness. \n\n In an effort to promote public awareness, the IC3 produces this annual report to aggregate and highlight the data provided by the general public. The quality of the data is directly attributable to the information ingested via the public interface www.ic3.gov. The IC3 attempts to standardize the data by categorizing each complaint based on the information provided. The IC3 staff analyzes the data, striving to identify trends relating to Internet-facilitated crimes and what those trends may represent in the coming year. \n\n The crime types are described in Appendix I. Additional considerations relating to the crime types are provided in Appendix III.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n###### Introduction 3\n\n History of the IC3  4\n\n The IC3’s Role in Combating Cyber Crime  4\n\n IC3 Database Remote Access 7\n\n Operation Wellspring Initiative 8\n\n Hot Topics for 2015: Business Email Compromise (BEC)  10\n\n Hot Topics for 2015 continued: Email Account Compromise (EAC) 10\n\n Hot Topics for 2015 continued: Ransomware 11\n\n 2015 Overall Statistics 12\n\n 2015 Complainant Demographics  13\n\n 2015 Top 10 States by Victim Complaints  14\n\n 2015 Top 5 Countries by Victim Complaints 14\n\n 2015 Crime Types  15\n\n 2015 Overall State Statistics 17\n\n 2015 State by State Statistics 21\n\n Appendix I: Crime Type Descriptions 226\n\n Appendix II: Public Service Announcements 231\n\n Appendix III: Additional Information about IC3 Data 232\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\n###### Dear Reader,\n\n As cyber criminals become more sophisticated in their efforts to target cyber victims, we must also grow our capabilities to successfully combat and defeat them. The evolving nature of Internet crime presents a unique set of challenges, as crimes often overlap jurisdictional boundaries and perpetrators can attack from anywhere on the globe. A crucial element to our mission of identifying, pursuing, and defeating cyber threats against our nation is the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which aids citizens by bringing pervasive cyber crimes and scams to the attention of law enforcement.\n\n The 2015 Internet Crime Report highlights the IC3’s efforts over the past year, specifically focusing on their efforts regarding Business Email Compromise (BEC) and Email Account Compromise (EAC) scams and the Operation Wellspring Initiative (OWS). \n\n The IC3 first began tracking complaints describing BEC scams in 2010, with the scams evolving to include EAC scams in 2015. In 2015, IC3 received over 8,000 complaints related to these threats with a combined reported loss of nearly $275 million. OWS launched in August 2013 and is currently active in eight FBI field offices around the country, with the goal of building the cyber investigative capability and capacity of the state and local law enforcement community. In 2015, the IC3 provided 165 referrals to Cyber Task Forces (CTFs), which resulted in 39 OWS cases. \n\n We hope the information presented in this report will be of value to you as we work together to protect our nation and combat these threats.

Coleman Executive Assistant Director Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n\n-----\n\n### History of the IC3\n\n###### In May 2000, the IC3 was established as a center to receive complaints of Internet crime. The IC3 received its one millionth complaint seven years later, in June 2007, two millionth in November 2010, and three millionth in 2014. There have been 3,463,620 complaints reported to the IC3 since its inception. Over the last five years, the IC3 received an average of nearly 300,000 complaints per year. The complaints address a wide array of Internet scams affecting victims across the globe. \n\n A bar graph comparing the number of complaints since iC3's inception in 2010.\r\nIn 2010 there were 303,809 complaints. In 2011 there were 314,236 complaints.\r\nIn 2012 there were 289,974 complaints. In 2013 there were 262,813 complaints.\r\nIn 2014 there were 269,422 complaints.\r\nIn 2015 there were 288,012 complaints. Overall, since the inception of iC3 in 2010, there have been a grand total of 3,463,620 complaints.\n\n### The IC3’s Role in Combating Cyber Crime\n\n###### In an interconnected world, the IC3 plays a critical role in our nation’s effort to reduce the amount of economic loss by Internet crime. One can view the IC3’s role in combating Internet crime as a part of an intricate puzzle. A short description of each piece is provided to explain how all pieces must work together to effectively address this global issue.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Millions of people in the United States are victims of Internet crimes each year. Only an estimated 15 percent of the nation’s fraud victims report their crimes to law enforcement.[1] This is just a subset of the victims worldwide. Detection is the first piece of the puzzle and is the cornerstone of the larger Internet crime picture.\n\n Victims are encouraged and often directed by law enforcement to file a complaint online at www.ic3.gov. Complainants are asked to document accurate and complete information related to the Internet crime, as well as any other relevant information necessary to support the complaint.\n\n Detection: Evidence, Presence, and Attempt of fraud. Complaint: Victim files a complaint at www.ic3.gov. Mitigation: Stop fraud and losses, and attempt recovery. Liaison: ic3 collaborates with all levels of law enforcement and establishes relationships with industry representatives. Analysis: All ic3 data is available for assessment and intelligence products are developed. Deterence: make it harder to commit fraud, issue public service announcements, distribute information through the media, and post information to the ic3 website. Investigation: information is gathered, interviews are conducted, and evidence is obtained. Prosecution: legal action is brought against perpetrator. Prevention: the goal is to stop fraud from occuring.\n\n1 [http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/victim-witness/victim-info/financial-fraud](http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/victim-witness/victim-info/financial-fraud)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In addition to reporting the crime via www.ic3.gov, complainants should take steps to mitigate further loss. Victims can take actions such as contacting banks, credit card companies, and/or credit bureaus to block accounts, freeze accounts, dispute charges, or attempt recovery of lost funds. Victims should be diligent in reviewing credit reports to dispute any unauthorized transactions and consider credit monitoring services.\n\n The IC3 is well positioned to be the central point for Internet crime victims to report and to alert the appropriate agencies of suspected criminal Internet activity. The IC3 reviews and analyzes data submitted through its website, and produces intelligence products to highlight emerging threats and new trends. Public service announcements (PSAs), scam alerts, and other publications outlining specific scams are posted to the www.ic3.gov website. As more people become aware of Internet crimes and the methods utilized to carry them out, potential victims are equipped with a broader understanding of the dangers associated with Internet activity and are in a better position to avoid falling prey to schemes online.\n\n One of the largest pieces of the puzzle falls into place when the IC3 aggregates related complaints to build referrals, which are forwarded to local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies for potential investigation. If law enforcement conducts an investigation and determines a crime has been committed, legal action may be brought against the perpetrator. Each and every piece of this puzzle is necessary to assist law enforcement in stopping Internet crime.\n\n\n-----\n\n### IC3 Database Remote Access\n\n###### A remote search capability of the IC3 database is available to all sworn law enforcement through the FBI’s Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal (LEEP).\n\n LEEP is a gateway providing law enforcement agencies, intelligence groups, and criminal justice entities access to beneficial resources. These resources strengthen case development for investigators, enhance information sharing between agencies, and are accessible in one centralized location. \n\n This web-based access provides users the ability to aggregate victims and losses to substantiate criminal activity with the office’s area of jurisdiction, and to enhance the development of cases. \n\n The IC3 recently expanded the remote search capabilities of the IC3 database by allowing users the ability to gather IC3 complaint statistics. A new tab allows users the ability to run city, state, county, and country reports and sort by crime type, age, and gender. The user can also run overall crime type reports and sort by city, state, and country. The report results can be returned as a PDF or exported to Excel. This new search capability allows users to better understand the scope of cyber crime in their area of jurisdiction and enhance case development. \n\n\n-----\n\n### Operation Wellspring Initiative\n\n###### The Operation Wellspring (OWS) Initiative launched in August 2013 with the Salt Lake City FBI Cyber Task Force (CTF), in partnership with the Utah Department of Public Safety. In 2014, OWS expanded to Dallas, TX, and San Diego, CA. Currently, Operation Wellspring offices are active in eight FBI field offices, which include the addition of the New York, NY; Buffalo, NY; Oklahoma City, OK; Knoxville, TN; and Kansas City, MO, field offices. \n\n OWS key components are:\n\n • Develop a national platform to receive, develop, and refer Internet-facilitated fraud complaints\n • Coordinate with FBI Cyber and Criminal Units\n • Market Internet-fraud statistical reporting through CTFs\n • Address Internet-facilitated criminal cases, which do not meet most federal investigative thresholds, by utilizing CTF state and local officers\n\n OWS builds the cyber investigative capability and capacity of the state and local law enforcement community. The partnership addresses Internet-based fraud schemes which were not being investigated by state and local law enforcement.\n\n OWS overall objectives are:\n\n • Create cyber intelligence-sharing environments with the FBI CTF as the single point of contact to state, local, and tribal law enforcement\n • Support coordinated investigations and prosecutions of computer intrusion and cyber crime cases under both state and federal laws\n • Develop the cyber expertise and technical capabilities of the state and local officers through on-the-job, online, and formal training and mentoring\n • Develop best practices \n • Increase victim reporting to the IC3 through CTF outreach\n\n The IC3 receives, on average, 800 complaints per day, and OWS offers CTFs a consistent resource to identifying Internet fraud subjects and victims located throughout the world. \n\n\n-----\n\n### Operation Wellspring Initiative continued\n\n###### In 2015, the IC3 provided 165 referrals to eight CTFs. The CTFs opened 39 OWS investigations in 2015. Approximately 3,650 individual complaints were provided within the 165 referrals and the total victim loss associated with these complaints was approximately $55 million[2].\n\n Eight Cyber Crime Task Forces, 39 open investigations, 3,644 victim complaints, and $55,000,000 in victim losses.\n2 Loss is based on adjusted loss.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Hot Topics for 2015\n\n###### Business Email Compromise (BEC)\n\n BEC is defined as a sophisticated scam targeting businesses working with foreign suppliers and/or businesses that regularly perform wire transfer payments. The scam is carried out by compromising legitimate business email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.\n\n The IC3 began receiving complaints describing BEC scams in 2010. Victims at the time identified themselves as United States–based businesses which had long-term working relationships with Asian suppliers. Victims were instructed through spoofed emails, intercepted facsimiles, or telephone communications to redirect invoice remittance payments. Fraudulent transfers have gone through accounts in many countries, with a large majority traveling through Asia. The scam began to evolve in 2013 when victims indicated the email accounts of Chief Executive Officers or Chief Financial Officers of targeted businesses were hacked or spoofed, and wire payments were requested to be sent to fraudulent locations. BEC continued to evolve, and in 2014, victim businesses reported having personal emails compromised and multiple fraudulent requests for payment sent to vendors identified from their contact list. In 2015, victims reported being contacted by subjects posing as lawyers or law firms instructing them to make secret or time sensitive wire transfers.\n\n BEC is linked to other types of criminal activity including romance, lottery, employment, and check scams. Victims of these scams may be used to unknowingly transfer fraudulent funds on behalf of the perpetrators. In 2015, the IC3 received 7,838 BEC complaints with losses of over $263 million[3].\n\n Email Account Compromise (EAC)\n\n EAC is a sister scam to BEC. EAC differs from BEC in that it targets individuals or individual professionals instead of businesses.\n\n EAC is defined as a sophisticated scam that targets the general public and professionals associated with, but not limited to, financial and lending institutions, real estate companies, and law firms. As in BEC, subjects use compromised emails to request payments to fraudulent locations. The EAC scenario has been reported by victims over a long period of time; however, specific tracking of victims began in July 2015 as BEC subjects began to overlap. Some EAC complaints were originally categorized as BEC, but have since further been identified as being\n\n3 Loss is based on adjusted loss.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### EAC. In 2015, the IC3 received 281 complaints identified as EAC with losses of over $11 million[4].\n\n Ransomware\n\n Ransomware is a form of malware that targets both human and technical weaknesses in organizations and individual networks in an effort to deny the availability of critical data and/or systems. Ransomware is frequently delivered through spear phishing emails to end users, resulting in the rapid encryption of sensitive files on a corporate network. When the victim organization determines they are no longer able to access their data, the cyber actor demands the payment of a ransom, typically in virtual currency such as BitCoin, at which time the actor will purportedly provide an avenue to the victim to regain access to their data. Recent iterations target enterprise end users, making awareness and training a critical preventative measure. In 2015, the IC3 received 2,453 complaints identified as Ransomware with losses of over $1.6 million[4].\n\n4 Loss is based on adjusted loss.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2015 Overall Statistics $1,070,711,522 losses reprted. 288,012 complaints received. 127,145 complaints reporting a loss. $8,421 average dollar loss for complaints reporting a loss. $3,718 average dollar loss. $560 median dollar loss.

State by State Statistics\n\n###### In an effort to better equip law enforcement with data specific to their jurisdictions, the IC3 implemented an enhanced reporting program in 2015. Using the new program, the IC3 developed numerous ad hoc reports that can be generated for cities, states, or countries and crime types. These improvements permit personnel to generate a report on a specific area of responsibility (AOR), which can be used by the law enforcement agencies to develop a better understanding of the types of computer-enabled crimes in their jurisdictions.\n\n This section details the types of complaints received by the IC3 for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia utilizing the new reporting capabilities. It is based on the total number of complaints and loss amounts from each state and the District of Columbia when the complainant provided state information. \n\n\n-----\n\n### Alabama\n\n\n######

All data in this report is based off of the reviewed and adjusted loss amounts.\n\n One complaint may have multiple crime types.\n\n Some complainants may have filed more than once, creating a possible duplicate. \n\n All location-based reports are generated based off of information entered when known/provided by the complainant. \n\n Losses reported in foreign currencies were converted to U.S. dollars when possible.\n\n Complaint counts represent the number of individual complaints received from each state and do not represent the number of individuals filing a complaint. \n\n Social media and virtual currency alone are not crime types, but are used in conjunction with one or more of the other crime types. For this reason, they are tracked by the IC3 for trend and reporting purposes. \n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center www.ic3.gov\n\n\n-----",
