An even more interesting part\nof the BlackEnergy story is the relatively unknown custom plugin capabilities to attack ARM\nand MIPS platforms, scripts for Cisco network devices, destructive plugins, a certificate\nstealer and more. Here, we present available data – it is difficult to collect on this APT. We\nwill also present more details on targets previously unavailable and present related victim\nprofile data.\n\nThese attackers are careful to hide and defend their long-term presence within compromised\nenvironments. The malware’s previously undescribed breadth means attackers present new\ntechnical challenges in unusual environments, including SCADA networks. Challenges, like\nmitigating the attackers’ lateral movement across compromised network routers, may take an\norganization’s defenders far beyond their standard routine and out of their comfort zone.\n\n## Brief History\n\nBlackEnergy2 and BlackEnergy3 are known tools. Initially, cybercriminals used BlackEnergy\ncustom plugins for launching DDoS attacks. There are no indications of how many groups\npossess this tool. BlackEnergy2 was eventually seen downloading more crimeware plugins –\na custom spam plugin and a banking information stealer custom plugin Over time\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackEnergy2 was assumed into the toolset of the BE2/Sandworm actor. While another\ncrimeware group continues to use BlackEnergy to launch DDoS attacks, the BE2 APT appears\nto have used this tool exclusively throughout 2014 at victim sites and included custom\nplugins and scripts of their own. To be clear, our name for this actor has been the BE2 APT,\nwhile it has been called “Sandworm Team” also.\n\n## The Plugins and Config Files\n\nBefore evidence of BlackEnergy2 use in targeted attacks was uncovered, we tracked strange\nactivity on one of the BlackEnergy CnC servers in 2013. This strangeness was related to\nvalues listed in newer BlackEnergy configuration files. As described in Dmitry’s 2010 Black\nDDoS’ analysis, a configuration file is downloaded from the server by main.dll on an infected\nsystem. The config file provides download instructions for the loader. It also instructs the\nloader to pass certain commands to the plugins. In this particular case in 2013, the config file\nincluded an unknown plugin set, aside from the usual ‘ddos’ plugin listing. Displayed below\nare these new, xml formatted plugin names “weap_hwi”, “ps”, and “vsnet” in a BlackEnergy\nconfiguration file download from a c2 server. This new module push must have been among\nthe first for this group, because all of the module versions were listed as “version 1”, including\nthe ddos plugin:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Config downloaded from BE2 server_\n\nThe ‘ps’ plugin turned out to be password stealer. The ‘vsnet’ plugin was intended to spread\nand launch a payload (BlackEnergy2 dropper itself at the moment) in the local network by\nusing PsExec, as well as gaining primary information on the user’s computer and network.\nMost surprising was the ‘weap_hwi’ plugin. It was a ddos tool compiled to run on ARM\nsystems:\n\n_Weap_hwi plugin_\n\nAt first, we didn’t know whether the ARM plugin was listed intentionally or by mistake, so we\nproceeded to collect the CnC’s config files. After pulling multiple config files, we confirmed\nthat this ARM object inclusion was not a one-off mistake. The server definitely delivered\nconfig files not only for Windows, but also for the ARM/MIPS platform. Though unusual, the\nARM module was delivered by the same server and it processed the same config file.\n\n## Linux plugins\n\nOver time we were able to collect several plugins as well as the main module for ARM and\nMIPS architectures. All of these ARM/MIPS object files were compiled from the same source\nand later pushed out in one config: “weap_msl”, “weap_mps”, “nm_hwi”, “nm_mps”,\n“weap_hwi”, and “nm_msl”. It’s interesting that the BE2 developers upgraded the ddos\nplugin to version 2, along with the nm_hwi, nm_mps, and nm_msl plugins.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey simultaneously released version 5 of the weap_msl, weap_mps, and weap_hmi plugins.\nThose assignments were not likely arbitrary, as this group had developed BlackEnergy2 for\nseveral years in a professional and organized style:\n\n_Config with a similar set of plugins for different architectures_\n\nHere is the list of retrieved files and related functionality:\n\n**weap** DDoS Attack (various types)\n\n**ps** password stealer handling a variety of network protocols\n(SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP, FTP, Telnet)\n\n**nm** scans ports, stores banners\n\n**snif** logs IP source and destination, TCP/UDP ports\n\n**hook** main module: CnC communication, config parser, plugins\nloader\n\n**uper** rewrites hook module with a new version and launches it\n\n\n-----\n\n_Weap, Snif, Nm plugin grammar mistakes and mis-spellings_\n\nThe developers’ coding style differed across the ‘Hook’ main module, the plugins, and the\nWindows main.dll. The hook main module contained encrypted strings and handled all the\nfunction calls and strings as the references in a large structure. This structure obfuscation\nmay be a rewrite effort to better modularize the code, but could also be intended to\ncomplicate analysis. Regardless, it is likely that different individuals coded the different\nplugins. So, the BE2 effort must have its own small team of plugin and multiplatform\ndevelopers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hook module structure_\n\nAfter decrypting the strings, it became clear that the Linux Hook main module\ncommunicated with the same CnC server as other Windows modules:\n\n_The CNC’s IP address in the Linux module_\n\nThis Linux module can process the following commands, some of\nwhich are similar to the Windows version:\n\n**die** delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces\n\n**kill** delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces and\nreboot\n\n**lexec** launch a command using bin/sh\n\n**rexec** download and launch file using ‘fork/exec’\n\n**update** rewrite self file\n\n**migrate** update the CnC server\n\n## Windows Plugins\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the disclosure of an unusual CnC server that pushed Linux and the new Windows\nplugins we paid greater attention to new BE2 samples and associated CnCs.\n\nDuring an extended period, we were able to collect many Windows plugins from different\nCnC servers, without ever noticing Linux plugins being downloaded as described above. It\nappears the BE2/SandWorm gang protected their servers by keeping their non-Windows\nhacker tools and plugins in separate servers or server folders. Finally, each CnC server hosts\na different set of plugins, meaning that each server works with different victims and uses\nplugins based on its current needs. Here is the summary list of all known plugins at the\nmoment:\n\n**fs** searches for given file types, gets primary system and network information\n\n**ps** password stealer from various sources\n\n**ss** makes screenshots\n\n**vsnet** spreads payload in the local network (uses psexec, accesses admin shares), gets\nprimary system and network information\n\n**rd** remote desktop\n\n**scan** scans ports of a given host\n\n**grc** backup channel via plus.google.com\n\n**jn** file infector (local, shares, removable devices) with the given payload downloaded\nfrom CnC\n\n**cert** certificate stealer\n\n**sn** logs traffic, extracts login-passwords from different protocol (HTTP, LDAP, FTP,\nPOP3, IMAP, Telnet )\n\n**tv** sets password hash in the registry for TeamViewer\n\n**prx** Proxy server\n\n**dstr** Destroys hard disk by overwriting with random data (on application level and\ndriver level) at a certain time\n\n**kl** keylogger\n\n**upd** BE2 service file updater\n\n**usb** gathers information on connected USBs (Device instance ID, drive geometry)\n\n**bios** gathers information on BIOS, motherboard, processor, OS\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are pretty sure that our list of BE2 tools is not complete. For example, we have yet\nto obtain the router access plugin, but we are confident that it exists. Evidence also supports\nthe hypothesis that there is a encryption plugin for victim files (see below).\n\nOur current collection represents the BE2 attackers’ capabilities quite well. Some plugins\nremain mysterious and their purpose is not yet clear, like ‘usb’ and ‘bios’. Why would the\nattackers need information on usb and bios characteristics? It suggests that based on a\nspecific USB and BIOS devices, the attackers may upload specific plugins to carry out\nadditional actions. Perhaps destructive, perhaps to further infect devices. We don’t know yet.\n\nIt’s also interesting to point out another plugin – ‘grc’. In some of the BE2 configuration files,\nwe can notice an value with a “gid” type:\n\n_The addr number in the config_\n\nThis number is an ID for the plus.google.com service and is used by the ‘grc’ plugin to parse\nhtml. It then downloads and decrypts a PNG file. The decrypted PNG is supposed to contain\na new config file, but we never observed one. We are aware of two related GooglePlus IDs.\nThe first one, plus.google.com/115125387226417117030/, contains an abnormal number of\nviews. At the time of writing, the count is 75 million:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 plus profile_\n\nThe second one – plus.google.com/116769597454024178039/posts – is currently more\nmodest at a little over 5,000 views. All of that account’s posts are deleted.\n\n## Tracked Commands\n\nDuring observation of the described above “router-PC” CnC we tracked the following\ncommands delivered in the config file before the server went offline. Our observation of\nrelated actions here:\n\n**u ps** start password stealing (Windows)\n\n**Ps_mps/ps_hwi start** start password stealing (Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\n**uper_mps/uper_hwi start** rewrite hook module with a new version and launch it\n(Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\n\n**Nm_mps/nm_hwi start –ban -**\n**middle**\n\n**U fsget * 7 *.docx, *.pdf, *.doc**\n\n\nScan ports and retrieve banners on the router subnet\n(Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\nsearch for docs with the given filetypes (Windows)\n\n\n**S sinfo** retrieve information on installed programs and launch\ncommands: systeminfo, tasklist, ipconfig, netstat, route\nprint, tracert [www.google.com (Windows)](http://www.google.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**weap_mps/weap_hwi**\n**host188.128.123.52**\n**port[25,26,110,465,995]**\n**typetcpconnect**\n\n**weap_mps/weap_hwi**\n**typesynflood port80**\n**cnt100000 spdmedium**\n**host212.175.109.10**\n\n\nDDoS on 188.128.123.52 (Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\nDDoS on 212.175.109.10 (Linux, MIPS, ARM)\n\n\nThe issued commands for the Linux plugins suggest the attackers controlled infected\nMIPS/ARM devices. We want to pay special attention to the DDoS commands meant for\nthese routers. 188.128.123.52 belongs to the Russian Ministry of Defense and 212.175.109.10\nbelongs to the Turkish Ministry of Interior’s government site. While many researchers\nsuspect a Russian actor is behind BE2, judging by their tracked activities and the victim\nprofiles, it’s still unclear whose interests they represent.\n\nWhile observing some other CnCs and pulling down config files, we stumbled upon some\nstrange mistakes and mis-typing. They are highlighted in the image below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 config file mistakes_\n\nFirst, these mistakes suggest that the BE2 attackers manually edit these config files.\nSecondly, it shows that even skilled hackers make mistakes.\n\n## Hard-Coded Command and Control\n\nThe contents of the config files themselves are fairly interesting. They all contain a callback\nc2 with a hardcoded ip address, contain timeouts, and some contain the commands listed\nabove. We include a list of observed hardcoded ip C2 addresses here, along with the address\nowner and geophysical location of the host:\n\n**C2 IP address** **Owner** **Country**\n\n184.22.205.194 hostnoc.net US\n\n5.79.80.166 Leaseweb NL\n\n46.165.222.28 Leaseweb NL\n\n95.211.122.36 Leaseweb NL\n\n46.165.222.101 Leaseweb NL\n\n46.165.222.6 Leaseweb NL\n\n89.149.223.205 Leaseweb NL\n\n85.17.94.134 Leaseweb NL\n\n46.4.28.218 Hetzner DE\n\n78.46.40.239 Hetzner DE\n\n95.143.193.182 Serverconnect SE\n\n188.227.176.74 Redstation GB\n\n93.170.127.100 Nadym RU\n\n37.220.34.56 Yisp NL\n\n194.28.172.58 Besthosting.ua UA\n\n124.217.253.10 PIRADIUS MY\n\n84.19.161.123 Keyweb DE\n\n109.236.88.12 worldstream.nl NL\n\n\n-----\n\n212.124.110.62 digitalone.com US\n\n5.61.38.31 3nt.com DE\n\n5.255.87.39 serverius.com NL\n\nIt’s interesting that one of these servers is a Tor exit node. And, according to the collected\nconfig files, the group upgraded their malware communications from plain text http to\nencrypted https in October 2013.\n\n## BE2 Targets and Victims\n\nBlackEnergy2 victims are widely distributed geographically. We identified BlackEnergy2\ntargets and victims in the following countries starting in late 2013. There are likely more\nvictims.\n\nRussia\nUkraine\nPoland\nLithuania\nBelarus\nAzerbaijan\nKyrgyzstan\nKazakhstan\nIran\nIsrael\nTurkey\nLibya\nKuwait\nTaiwan\nVietnam\nIndia\nCroatia\nGermany\nBelgium\nSweden\n\nVictim profiles point to an expansive interest in ICS:\n\npower generation site owners\npower facilities construction\npower generation operators\nlarge suppliers and manufacturers of heavy power related materials\ninvestors\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, we also noticed that the target list includes government, property holding, and\ntechnology organizations as well:\n\nhigh level government\nother ICS construction\nfederal land holding agencies\nmunicipal offices\nfederal emergency services\nspace and earth measurement and assessment labs\nnational standards body\nbanks\nhigh-tech transportation\nacademic research\n\n## Victim cases\n\nWe gained insight into significant BE2 victim profiles over the summer of 2014.\nInteresting BE2 incidents are presented here.\n\n**Victim #1**\n\nThe BE2 attackers successfully spearphished an organization with an exploit for which there\nis no current CVE, and a metasploit module has been available This email message contained\na ZIP archive with EXE file inside that did not appear to be an executable. This crafted zip\narchive exploited a WinRAR flaw that makes files in zip archives appear to have a different\nname and file extension.\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 spearphish example_\n\nThe attached exe file turned out to be ‘BlackEnergy-like’ malware, which researchers already\ndubbed ‘BlackEnergy3’ – the gang uses it along with BlackEnergy2. Kaspersky Lab detects\n‘BlackEnergy3’ malware as Backdoor.Win32.Fonten – naming it after its dropped file\n“FONTCACHE.DAT”\n\nWhen investigating computers in the company’s network, only BE2 associated files were\nfound, suggesting BE3 was used as only a first-stage tool on this network. The config files\nwithin BE2 contained the settings of the company’s internal web proxy:\n\n_BE2 config file contains victim’s internal proxy_\n\nAs the APT-specific BE2 now stores the downloaded plugins in encrypted files on the system\n(not seen in older versions – all plugins were only in-memory), the administrators were able\nto collect BE2 files from the infected machines. After decrypting these files, we could retrieve\nplugins launched on infected machines: ps vsnet fs ss dstr\n\n\n-----\n\nBy all appearances, the attackers pushed the dstr module when they understood that they\nwere revealed, and wanted to hide their presence on the machines. Some machines already\nlaunched the plugin, lost their data and became unbootable.\n\n_Destructive dstr command in BE2 config_\n_file_\n\nAlso, on some machines, documents were\nencrypted, but no related plugin could\nbe found.\n\n**Victim #2**\n\nThe second organization was hacked via the first victim’s stolen VPN credentials. After the\nsecond organization was notified about the infection they started an internal investigation.\nThey confirmed that some data was destroyed on their machines, so the BE2 attackers have\nexhibited some level of destructive activity. And, they revealed that their Cisco routers with\ndifferent IOS versions were hacked. They weren’t able to connect to the routers any more by\ntelnet and found the following “farewell” tcl scripts in the router’s file system:\n\nCiscoapi.tcl – contains various wrappers over cisco EXEC-commands as described in the\ncomments.\n\nThe comment includes a punchy message for “kasperRsky”:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 ciscoapi.tcl fragment_\n\nKillint.tcl – uses Ciscoapi.tcl, implements destroying functions:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BE2 killint.tcl fragment_\n\nThe script tries to download ciscoapi.tcl from a certain FTP server which served as a storage\nfor BE2 files. The organization managed to discover what scripts were hosted on the server\nbefore BE/SandWorm gang deleted them, and unfortunately couldn’t restore them after they\nwere deleted. The BE2 actor performs careful, professional activity covering their tracks:\n\nciscoapi.tcl\nkillint.tcl\ntelnetapi2.tcl\ntelnetu.tcl\nstub.tcl\nstub1.tcl\n\nThere is evidence that the logs produced by some scripts were also stored on the FTP server,\nin particular the information on CDP neighbors which is provided by one of the procedures of\nciscoapi.tcl.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Victim #3**\n\nThe third organization got compromised by the same type of attack as the first one (an EXE\nfile spoofing a doc within a Zip archive). All the plugins discovered in BE2 files were known,\nand there was no revelation of hacked network devices on their side and no destroyed data.\nThe noticeable thing is that many computers contained both BE2 and BE3 files and some\nconfig files contained the following URL:\n\nhxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/f3395cd54cf857ddf8f2056768ff49ae/getcfg.php\n\nThe URL contains the md5 of the string ‘router’. One of the discovered config files contained\na URL with an as yet unidentified md5:\n\nhxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/bf0dac805798cc1f633f19ce8ed6382f/upgrade.php\n\nVictim set #4\n\nA set of victims discovered installed Siemens SCADA software in their ICS environment was\nresponsible for downloading and executing BlackEnergy. Starting in March 2014 and ending\nin July 2014, Siemens “ccprojectmgr.exe” downloaded and executed a handful of different\npayloads hosted at 94.185.85.122/favicon.ico. They are all detected as variants\nof “Backdoor.Win32.Blakken”.\n\n## Build IDs\n\nEach config file within BE2 main.dll has a field called build_id which identifies the malware\nversion for the operators. Currently this particular BE/SandWorm gang uses a certain\npattern for the build ids containing three hex numbers and three letters, as follows:\n\n0C0703hji\n\nThe numbers indicate the date of file creation in the format: Year-Month-Day. Still, the\npurpose of the letters is unknown, but most likely it indicates the targets. The hex numbers\nweren’t used all the time, sometimes we observed decimal numbers:\n\n100914_mg\n\n100929nrT\n\nMost interesting for us was the earliest build id we could find. Currently it is “OB020Ad0V”,\nmeaning that the BE2/SandWorm APT started operating as early as the beginning of 2010.\n\n## Appendix: IoC\n\n\n-----\n\nSince BE dropper installs its driver under a randomly picked non-used Windows driver\nname, there is no a static name for a driver to use it as IOC. The driver is self-signed on 64bit systems\n\nHowever, new “APT” BE2 uses one of the following filenames that are used as an encrypted\nstorage for plugins and the network settings. They are consistent and serve as stable IoC:\n\n%system32%driverswinntd_.dat\n%system32%driverswinntd.dat\n%system32%driverswincache.dat\n%system32%driversmlang.dat\n%system32%driversosver32nt.dat\n%LOCALAPPDATA%adobewind002.dat\n%LOCALAPPDATA%adobesettings.sol\n%LOCALAPPDATA%adobewinver.dat\n%LOCALAPPDATA%adobecache.dat\n\nBE2
