The bootkit, which we’ve named ESPecter, can bypass Windows Driver\nSignature Enforcement to load its own unsigned driver, which facilitates its espionage activities.\n[Alongside Kaspersky’s recent discovery of the unrelated FinSpy bootkit, it is now safe to say that real-](https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/)\n[world UEFI threats are no longer limited to SPI flash implants, as used by Lojax.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/27/lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-found-wild-courtesy-sednit-group/)\n\nThe days of UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) living in the shadows of the legacy BIOS are\ngone for good. As a leading technology embedded into chips of modern computers and devices, it plays a\ncrucial role in securing the pre-OS environment and loading the operating system. And it’s no surprise\nthat such a widespread technology has also become a tempting target for threat actors in their search for\nultimate persistence.\n\n[In the last few years, we have seen proof-of-concept examples of UEFI bootkits (DreamBoot, EfiGuard),](https://github.com/quarkslab/dreamboot)\n[leaked documents (DerStarke, QuarkMatter) and even leaked source code (Hacking Team Vector EDK),](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_26968082.html)\nsuggesting the existence of real UEFI malware either in the form of SPI flash implants or ESP implants.\nDespite all of the above, only three real-world cases of UEFI malware have been discovered so far\n[(LoJax, discovered by our team in 2018, MosaicRegressor, discovered by Kaspersky in 2019, and most](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ESET-LoJax.pdf)\nrecently the FinSpy bootkit, whose analysis was just published by Kaspersky). While the first two fall in\nthe category of SPI flash implants, the last falls in the ESP implants category, and surprisingly, it’s not\nalone there.\n\nToday, we describe our recent discovery of ESPecter, just the second real-world case of a UEFI bootkit\npersisting on the ESP in the form of a patched Windows Boot Manager to be analyzed. ESPecter was\nencountered on a compromised machine along with a user-mode client component with keylogging and\ndocument-stealing functionalities, which is why we believe ESPecter is mainly used for espionage.\nInterestingly, we traced the roots of this threat back to at least 2012, previously operating as a bootkit for\nsystems with legacy BIOSes. Despite ESPecter’s long existence, its operations and upgrade to UEFI went\nunnoticed and have not been documented until now. Note that the only similarity between ESPecter and\nthe Kaspersky FinSpy find is that they share the UEFI boot manager compromise approach.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Comparison of the Legacy Boot flow (left) and UEFI boot flow (right) on Windows (Vista and newer)_\n\n_systems_\n\nBy patching the Windows Boot Manager, attackers achieve execution in the early stages of the system\nboot process (see Figure 1), before the operating system is fully loaded. This allows ESPecter to bypass\nWindows Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) in order to execute its own unsigned driver at system\nstartup. This driver then injects other user-mode components into specific system processes to initiate\ncommunication with ESPecter’s C&C server and to allow the attacker to take control of the compromised\nmachine by downloading and running additional malware or executing C&C commands.\n\nEven though Secure Boot stands in the way of executing untrusted UEFI binaries from the ESP, over the\nlast few years we have been witness to various UEFI firmware vulnerabilities affecting thousands of\n[devices that allow disabling or bypassing Secure Boot (e.g. VU#758382, VU#976132, VU#631788, …).](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/758382)\nThis shows that securing UEFI firmware is a challenging task and that the way various vendors apply\nsecurity policies and use UEFI services is not always ideal.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Previously, we have reported multiple malicious EFI samples in the form of simple, single-purpose UEFI](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1275770256389222400?s=20)\napplications without extensive functionality. These observations, along with the concurrent discovery of\n[the ESPecter and FinFisher bootkits, both fully functional UEFI bootkits, show that threat actors are not](https://securelist.com/finspy-unseen-findings/104322/)\nrelying only on UEFI firmware implants when it comes to pre-OS persistence, but also are trying to take\nadvantage of disabled Secure Boot to execute their own ESP implants.\n\nWe were not able to attribute ESPecter to any known threat actor, but the Chinese debug messages in\nthe associated user-mode client component (as seen in Figure 2) leads us to believe with a low\nconfidence that an unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor is behind ESPecter. At this point, we don’t\nknow how it was distributed.\n\n_Figure 2. Example of Chinese debug messages in the user-mode client component_\n\n## Evolution of the ESPecter bootkit\n\nWhen we looked at our telemetry, we were able to date the beginnings of this bootkit back to at least\n2012. At its beginning, it used MBR (Master Boot Record) modification as its persistence method and its\nauthors were continuously adding support for new Windows OS versions. What is interesting is that the\nmalware’s components have barely changed over all these years and the differences between 2012 and\n2020 versions are not as significant as one would expect.\n\nAfter all the years of insignificant changes, those behind ESPecter apparently decided to move their\nmalware from legacy BIOS systems to modern UEFI systems. They decided to achieve this by modifying\na legitimate Windows Boot Manager binary (bootmgfw.efi) located on the ESP while supporting\nmultiple Windows versions spanning Windows 7 through Windows 10 inclusive. As we mentioned\nearlier, this method has one drawback – it requires that the Secure Boot feature be disabled in order to\nsuccessfully boot with a modified boot manager. However, it’s worth mentioning that the first Windows\nversion supporting Secure Boot was Windows 8, meaning that all previous versions are vulnerable to\nthis persistence method.\n\nFor Windows OS versions that support Secure Boot, the attacker would need to disable it. For now, it’s\nunknown how the ESPecter operators achieved this, but there are a few possible scenarios:\n\nThe attacker has physical access to the device (historically known as an “evil maid” attack) and\nmanually disables Secure Boot in the BIOS setup menu (it is common for the firmware\nconfiguration menu to still be labeled and referred to as the “BIOS setup menu”, even on UEFI\nsystems).\nSecure Boot was already disabled on the compromised machine (e.g., user might dual-boot\nWindows and other OSes that do not support Secure Boot).\nExploiting an unknown UEFI firmware vulnerability that allows disabling Secure Boot.\nExploiting a known UEFI firmware vulnerability in the case of an outdated firmware version or a\nno-longer-supported product.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our investigation, we discovered several malicious components related to ESPecter:\n\nInstallers, only for the older MBR versions of the bootkit, whose purpose was to set up persistence\non the machine by rewriting the MBR of the boot device.\nBoot code in the form of either a modified Windows Boot Manager (bootmgfw.efi) on UEFI\nsystems or a malicious MBR in the case of Legacy Boot systems.\nA kernel-mode driver used to prepare the environment for the user-mode payloads and to load\nthem in the early stages of OS startup by injecting them into specific system processes.\nUser-mode payloads responsible for communication with the C&C, updating the C&C\nconfiguration and executing C&C commands.\n\nFor the complete scheme of the ESPecter bootkit compromise, see Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. ESPecter bootkit components_\n\n### Achieving persistence – UEFI boot\n\nOn systems using UEFI Boot mode, ESPecter persistence is established by modifying the Windows Boot\nManager bootmgfw.efi and the fallback bootloader binary bootx64.efi, which are usually located in the\nESP directories \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\ and \\EFI\\Boot\\, respectively. Modification of the bootloader\nincludes adding a new section called .efi to the PE, and changing the executable’s entry point address so\nprogram flow jumps to the beginning of the added section, as seen in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Comparison of original (top) and modified (bottom) Windows Boot Manager (bootmgfw.efi)_\n\n**_Simplified boot chain_**\n\nAs shown in the scheme on the left in Figure 5, the boot process on UEFI systems (ignoring the firmware\npart) starts with execution of the bootloader application located in the ESP. For the Windows OS, this is\nthe Windows Boot Manager binary (bootmgfw.efi) and its purpose is to find an installed operating\nsystem and transfer execution to its OS kernel loader – winload.efi. Similar to the boot manager, the OS\nkernel loader is responsible for the loading and execution of the next component in the boot chain – the\nWindows kernel (ntoskrnl.exe).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Boot flow modified by ESPecter_\n\n**_How does ESPecter modify the UEFI boot process?_**\n\nIn order to successfully drop its malicious payload, ESPecter needs to bypass integrity checks performed\nby the Windows Boot Manager and the Windows kernel during the boot process. To do this, it looks for\nbyte patterns identifying the desired functions in memory and patches them accordingly.\n\nStarting with the bootloader, in our case Windows Boot Manager (bootmgfw.efi), the bootkit begins by\npatching the BmFwVerifySelfIntegrity function. This function is responsible for verification of the boot\nmanager’s own digital signature and is intended to prevent execution of a modified boot manager. In\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 you can see how ESPecter searches memory for BmFwVerifySelfIntegrity using various byte\npatterns (to support many bootmgfw.efi versions) and modifies this function in a way that it always\nreturns zero, indicating that verification was successful.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the bootloader’s main goal is to find an installed operating system and transfer\nexecution to its OS kernel loader. For the Windows Boot Manager, this happens in the\nArchpx64TransferTo64BitApplicationAsm function; therefore, ESPecter looks for this function in order\nto catch the moment that the OS loader is loaded into memory, but still hasn’t been executed. If found,\nESPecter patches this function to insert its own detour function, which can easily modify the loaded OS\nloader in memory at the right moment.\n\n_Figure 6. Hex-Rays decompiled code – searching for and patching the BmFwVerifySelfIntegrity function_\n\nModification of the OS loader does not include patching of any integrity checks or other functionality. At\nthis stage it’s important for the bootkit to reallocate its code, because as a UEFI Application it will be\nunloaded from memory after returning from its entry point function. For this purpose, it uses the\nBlImgAllocateImageBuffer or BlMmAllocateVirtualPages function (depending on the pattern found).\nAfter this reallocation, the bootkit inserts a detour (located in the previously allocated buffer) to the\nfunction responsible for transferring execution to the OS kernel – OslArchTransferToKernel – so it can\npatch the Windows kernel in memory, once it is loaded but before it is executed. The final stage of the\nbootkit’s boot code is responsible for disabling DSE by patching the SepInitializeCodeIntegrity kernel\nfunction (see Figure 7 for details).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Comparison of Hex-Rays decompiled SepInitializeCodeIntegrity function before (left) and after (right) it is_\n\n_patched in memory_\n\nInterestingly, the boot code also patches the MiComputeDriverProtection kernel function. Even though\nthis function does not directly affect successful loading of the malicious driver, the bootkit does not\nproceed to the driver dropping if it does not find and patch this function in kernel memory. We were not\nable to identify the purpose of this second patch, but we assume this modified function may be used by\nother, as yet unknown, ESPecter components.\n\n\\SystemRoot\\System32\\null.sys (driver)\n\\SystemRoot\\Temp\\syslog (encrypted configuration)\n\nThe configuration is used by the WinSys.dll user-mode component deployed by the kernel driver and\nconsists of a one-byte XOR key followed by the encrypted configuration data. To decrypt the\nconfiguration, WinSys.dll:\n\n1. Base64 decodes the configuration data\n2. XORs the data with the XOR key\n3. Base64 decodes each value delimited by “|” separately\n\nAn example of a configuration dropped by the EFI version of ESPecter is presented in Figure 8. A full list\nof IP addresses and domains from configurations embedded in the ESPecter bootkit samples that we\nhave discovered (both Legacy Boot and UEFI versions) is included in the IoCs section.\n\n_Figure 8. Decryption of configuration delivered by the EFI version of the ESPecter bootkit_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Achieving persistence – Legacy Boot\n\nAs already mentioned, there are ESPecter versions supporting UEFI, and others supporting Legacy\nBoot, modes. In the case of Legacy Boot mode, persistence is achieved by the well-known technique of\nmodifying the MBR code located in the first physical sector of the disk drive; therefore, we won’t explain\nit in detail here, but will just summarize it.\n\n**_How does ESPecter modify the Legacy Boot process?_**\n\nThe malicious MBR first decrypts code previously copied to disk sectors 2, 3 and 4 by the installer,\n[hooks the real-mode INT13h (BIOS sector read-write services) interrupt handler and then passes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_13H)\nexecution to the original MBR code, backed up to the second sector (sector 1) by the installer. Similar to\nother known MBR bootkits, when the INT13h interrupt handler is invoked, hook code (located in sector\n0) checks for service 0x02 (Read sectors from drive) and 0x42 (Extended read sectors from drive) being\nhandled in order to intercept loading of bootmgr – the legacy version of the Windows Boot Manager.\nNote that ESPecter legacy versions do not need to patch the BmFwVerifySelfIntegrity function in\nbootmgr, because the bootmgr binary wasn’t modified in any way.\n\nFrom this point, the functionality of the boot code is almost the same as in the UEFI version, resulting in\ndropping the malicious driver (located contiguously on Track 0, starting at sector 6) into one of the\nfollowing locations, depending on the architecture:\n\n\\SystemRoot\\System32\\drivers\\beep.sys (x86)\n\\SystemRoot\\System32\\drivers\\null.sys (x64)\n\nIn this case, the encrypted configuration is not dropped to the syslog file but stays hidden in sector 5 of\nthe compromised disk.\n\n_Figure 9. Modified disk scheme used by the legacy ESPecter version_\n\n### Kernel-mode driver\n\nThe driver’s main purpose is to load user-mode payloads, set up the keylogger and, in the end, delete\nitself. Setting up the keylogger is done in two steps:\n\nAt first, it creates a device named \\Device\\WebBK that exposes a function handling\nIRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL requests from the user-mode components. This function supports\none IOCTL (Input/Output Control) code (0x22C004), which can be used to trigger registration of\nan asynchronous procedure call routine responsible for processing intercepted keystrokes.\nInterception of keystrokes is done by setting up CompletionRoutine for IRP_MJ_READ requests\nfor the keyboard driver object \\Device\\KeyboardClass0.\n\nWhen done, any process can start logging intercepted keystrokes by defining its own routine and passing\nit to the created device object using the custom IOCTL 0x22C004.\n\nBy default, the driver tries to load two base payloads – WinSys.dll and Client.dll – which have the ability\n[to download and execute additional payloads. The first one, WinSys.dll, is an MPRESS-packed DLL](https://www.autohotkey.com/mpress/mpress_web.htm)\nembedded in the driver’s binary in an encrypted form. The second one, Client.dll, is downloaded by\n\n\n-----\n\nWinSys.dll to the file \\SystemRoot\\Temp\\memlog, also in an encrypted form, using the same\nencryption method – a simple one-byte XOR with subtraction – but not the same keys. Both libraries\nare decrypted and dropped to the system directory \\SystemRoot\\System32\\ by the driver.\n\nExecution of both WinSys.dll and Client.dll libraries is achieved by injecting them into svchost.exe and\nwinlogon.exe, respectively. To do this, the driver registers the image load callback routine NotifyRoutine\nusing PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine, which is used to execute:\n\nThe MainThread export from Client.dll, in context of the winlogon.exe process\nThe MainThread export from WinSys.dll, in context of the svchost.exe process\n\nNotifyRoutine hooks the entry point of the winlogon.exe and svchost.exe process images in memory\nbefore being executed; this hook is then responsible for loading and executing the appropriate payload\nDLL. As shown in Figure 10, only the first svchost.exe or winlogon.exe image being loaded is processed\nby the routine.\n\n_Figure 10. Hex-Rays decompiled NotifyRoutine checking if svchost.exe or winlogon.exe is being loaded_\n\n### User-mode components – WinSys.dll\n\nWinSys.dll acts as a base update agent, which periodically contacts its C&C server in order to download\nor execute additional payloads or execute simple commands. The C&C address, along with other values\nlike campaign ID, bootkit version, time between C&C communication attempts and active hours range,\nare located in the configuration, which can be loaded from:\n\nDefaultConfig value in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control registry\n\\SystemRoot\\Temp\\syslog file\nor directly from the specific disk sector (in the Legacy Boot version)\n\nIf both registry- and disk-stored configurations exist, the one from the registry is used.\n\n### C&C communication\n\nWinSys.dll communicates with its C&C using HTTPS and the communication is initiated by sending an\nHTTP GET request using the following URL format:\n\nhttps://<ip>/Heart.aspx?ti=<drive_ID>&tn=<campaign_ID>&tg=<number>&tv=<malware_version>\n\n\n-----\n\nwhere drive_ID is the MD5 hash of the serial number of the main system volume and the other\nparameters are further information identifying this instance of the malware.\n\nAs a result, the C&C can respond with the command ID represented as a string, optionally followed by\ncommand parameters. The full list of commands is available in Table 1.\n\n_Table 1. WinSys component C&C commands_\n\n**Command ID** **Description** **URL**\n\n1 or 4 Exit. \n\n2 Upload various system info (CPU\nname, OS version, memory size,\nethernet MAC address, list of installed\nsoftware, etc.) to the predefined URL\nusing the HTTP POST.\n\n3 Download or download and execute\nfile into one of the predefined\nlocations (listed in IoCs ) from the\npredefined URL using HTTP GET.\n\n5 Restart PC via ExitProcess (for\nWindows Vista only).\n\n6 Download new configuration from the\npredefined URL using HTTP GET and\nsave it in the registry.\n\n### User-mode components – Client.dll\n\n\nhttps://<ip>/GetSysteminfo.aspx\n\nhttps://<ip>/UpLoad.aspx?ti=<drive_ID>\n\nN/A\n\nhttps://<ip>/ModifyIpaddr.aspx?ti=<drive_ID>\n\n\nThe second payload deployed by the malicious driver, if available, is Client.dll. It’s a backdoor that\nsupports a rich set of commands (Table 2) and contains various automatic data exfiltration capabilities\nincluding document stealing, keylogging, and monitoring of the victim’s screen by periodically taking\nscreenshots. All of the collected data is stored in a hidden directory, with separate subdirectories for\n[each data source – the full list of directory paths used is available from our GitHub repository. Also note](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/especter)\nthat interception of the keyboard is handled by the driver and the client just needs to register its logging\nfunction by sending IOCTL 0x22C004 to the driver’s device in order to save intercepted keystrokes to\nthe file (Figure 11).\n\n_Figure 11. Client payload setting up keylogger function by sending IOCTL to the bootkit’s device driver_\n\nConfiguration for the Client component should be located in an encrypted form in the file’s overlay. It\ncontains information such as the C&C address and port, flags indicating what data should be collected\n(keystrokes, screenshots, files with specific extensions), time period for the screenshotting thread,\nmaximum file size for exfiltrated data and a list of file extensions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_C&C communication_**\n\nThe client sets its own communication channel with the C&C. For communication with the C&C, it uses\nthe TCP protocol with single-byte XOR encryption applied to non-null message bytes that are different\nfrom the key, which was 0x66 in the campaign analyzed here. Communication is initiated by sending\nbeacon messages to the IP:PORT pair specified in the configuration. This message contains the drive_ID\nvalue (the MD5 hash of the serial number of the main system volume) along with a value specifying the\ntype of message – that is, a command request or the uploading of collected data.\n\nAfter execution of the C&C command, the result is reported back to the C&C specifying the result code of\nthe executed operation, command ID and, interestingly, each such resulting report message contains a\nwatermark/tag representing the wide string WBKP located at offset 0x04, which makes it easier to\nidentify this malicious communication at the network level.\n\n_Table 2. List of Client C&C commands_\n\n**Command ID** **Description**\n\n0x0000 Stop backdoor.\n\n0x0064 Execute command line received from C&C and capture output using pipes.\n\n0x00C8 Execute power commands logoff, power off, reboot, or shutdown, depending on the\nvalue of this C&C command’s parameter.\n\n0x012C Take screenshot of foreground window, full screenshot, or change automatic\nscreenshotting parameters, depending on the value of the parameter.\n\n0x0190 Execute various file system operations.\n\n0x01F4 Upload collected data and files.\n\n0x0258 Execute various service-related commands.\n\n0x02BC Execute various process-related commands.\n\n0x0320 Modify configuration values.\n\n0x0384 Stop/start keylogger, depending on the value of the parameter.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nESPecter shows that threat actors are relying not only on UEFI firmware implants when it comes to preOS persistence and, despite the existing security mechanisms like UEFI Secure Boot, invest their time\ninto creating malware that would be easily blocked by such mechanisms, if enabled and configured\ncorrectly.\n\nTo keep safe against threats similar to the ESPecter bootkit, make sure that:\n\nYou always use the latest firmware version.\nYour system is properly configured and Secure Boot is enabled.\n[You apply proper Privileged Account Management to help prevent adversaries from accessing](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026)\nprivileged accounts necessary for bootkit installation.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n-----\n\n[A comprehensive list of IoCs
