The company confirmed the incident and that data had been](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/digital-security-giant-entrust-breached-by-ransomware-gang/)\nstolen.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Entrust did not pay the ransom and LockBit announced that it would publish all the stolen](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-claims-ransomware-attack-on-security-giant-entrust-leaks-data/)\ndata on August 19. This did not happen, though, because the gang’s leak site was hit by\na [DDoS attack believed to be connected to Entrust.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-blames-entrust-for-ddos-attacks-on-leak-sites/)\n\n## LockBit getting into DDoS\n\nEarlier this week, LockBitSupp, the public-facing figure of the LockBit ransomware operation,\nannounced that the group is back in business with a larger infrastructure to give access to\nleaks unfazed by DDoS attacks.\n\nThe DDoS attack last weekend that put a temporary stop to leaking Entrust data was seen\nas an opportunity to explore the triple extortion tactic to apply more pressure on victims to\npay a ransom.\n\nLockBitSupp said that the ransomware operator is now looking to add DDoS as an extortion\ntactic on top of encrypting data and leaking it.\n\n“I am looking for dudosers [DDoSers] in the team, most likely now we will attack targets and\nprovide triple extortion, encryption + date leak + dudos, because I have felt the power of\ndudos and how it invigorates and makes life more interesting,” LockBitSupp wrote in a post\non a hacker forum.\n\n## Leaking Entrust data\n\nThe gang also promised to share over torrent 300GB of data stolen from Entrust so “the\nwhole world will know your secrets.”\n\nLockBit’s spokesperson said that they would share the Entrust data leak privately with\nanyone that contacts them before making it available over torrent.\n\nIt appears that LockBit has kept its promise and released this weekend a torrent called\n“entrust.com” with 343GB of files.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Lockbit**\n\n**ransomware leaks Entrust data**\n_source: Artie Yamamoto_\nThe operators wanted to make sure that Entrust's data is available from multiple sources\nand, besides publishing it on their site, they also shared the torrent over at least two file\nstorage services, with one of them no longer making it available.\n\n\n-----\n\n## DDoS defenses\n\nOne method already implemented to prevent further DDoS attacks is to use unique links in\nthe ransom notes for the victims.\n\n“The function of randomization of links in the notes of the locker has already been\nimplemented, each build of the locker will have a unique link that the dudoser [DDoSer] will\nnot be able to recognize,” LockBitSupp posted.\n\nThey also announced an increase in the number of mirrors and duplicate servers, and a plan\nto increase the availability of stolen data by making it accessible over clearnet, too, via a\nbulletproof storage service.\n\n**Lockbit ransomware changes after suffering DDoS attack**\n\n_source: BleepingComputer_\nAfter publishing this article, BleepingComputer learned that LockBit has made the stolen\nEntrust data available over clearnet, on a website that provides files for a limited period.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LockBit shares**\n\n**over clearnet the torrent for stolen Entrust data**\n_[source: BleepingComputer (h/t DJX)](https://twitter.com/threatosint)_\nLockBit ransomware operation has been active for almost three years, since September\n2019. At the time of writing, LockBit’s data leak site is up and running.\n\nThe gang is listing more than 700 victims and Entrust is one of them, with data for the\ncompany leaked on August 27.\n\n**Update [August 29, 09:12]: Article updated with info on Entrust data being shared over**\nclearnet.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[LockBit ransomware blames Entrust for DDoS attacks on leak sites](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-blames-entrust-for-ddos-attacks-on-leak-sites/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - August 26th 2022 - Fighting back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-august-26th-2022-fighting-back/)\n\n[RansomEXX claims ransomware attack on Sea-Doo, Ski-Doo maker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomexx-claims-ransomware-attack-on-sea-doo-ski-doo-maker/)\n\n[LockBit claims ransomware attack on security giant Entrust, leaks data](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-claims-ransomware-attack-on-security-giant-entrust-leaks-data/)\n\n[BlackByte ransomware gang is back with new extortion tactics](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackbyte-ransomware-gang-is-back-with-new-extortion-tactics/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
