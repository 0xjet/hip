It is however often more interesting to\nanalyze campaigns smaller in volume as they might contain more interesting malware. A few\nweeks ago I became interested in just such a campaign with a smaller number of circulating\nemail messages. The email, first of them submitted from Middle East, purports to be coming\nfrom a Turkish trading company, which might further indicate the geographic area where the\nattacks were active. Analyzing malware is often like solving a puzzle, you have to do it piece\nby piece to reach the final image. In this case I spent more time analyzing the campaign than\nI initially planned. The campaign has many stages of the infection chain and all needed to be\nunraveled before the final payload level was reached. Furthermore, each of the stages used\ndifferent development platform and was obfuscated in a different way. But let us start from\nthe beginning.\n\n## Stage 1 - email\n\nThe email message contains two attachments. The first one is a Word document in the Office\nOpen XML file format while the second is a ZIP file PurchaseOrders zip containing an\n\n\n-----\n\nexecutable file PurchaseOrders.exe. This is a relatively unusual strategy for email\ncampaigns as it is much more common for malicious emails to contain a single attachment\nrather than two or more. It seems that the attackers wanted to be double sure that the\nrecipient will open at least one of the attachments.\n\nEmail campaign\n\n## Stage 2a - Word Document - CVE-2013-3906\n\nThe Word document attachment, “Letter of introduction.doc” contains an exploit for CVE2013-3906 tiff image file parsing vulnerability. The document contains multiple TabStrip\n(classid: {1EFB6596-857C-11D1-B16A-00C0F0283628}) ActiveX controls also used in CVE2012-1856.\n\n\n-----\n\nEmbedded ActiveX controls used for heap spray\n\nEmbedded TabStrip ActiveX controls are used for heap spraying and the embedded TIFF file\nnamed image1.jpeg triggers the CVE-2013-3906 vulnerability. There are 40 embedded\nActiveX controls and each is mapped in 2MB allocated memory space. In this case,\nexploitation takes time but the exploit eventually crashes the vulnerable versions of Word\nand starts the shellcode. The shellcode is immediately visible in the hex dump of the ActiveX\nOLE2 file and sprayed in the memory of the exploited Word process.\n\nHeap sprayed shellcode from ActiveXn.bin files\n\n**Shellcode - hook evasion**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe shellcode itself is relatively simple and, give or take, 450 bytes long, excluding the URL\nused for downloading the payload. As is often the case, the APIs are found by parsing the\nProcess Environment Block (PEB) and traversing the linked list of loaded modules as well as\ntheir respective exported functions.\n\nNotably, before calling required APIs, the shellcode checks for presence of inline hooks,\noften installed by endpoint security products and jumps over the installed hook code in order\nto avoid being noticed in their behavior detection windows.\n\nEvading security hooks\n\nIf the user was infected by the attached Word document, the shellcode would download and\nexecute an executable from a legitimate, compromised server. The C2 server for the final\npayload is extracted from a configuration blob stored encrypted within the downloaded\npayload body.\n\n## Stage 2b - PurchaseOrders.exe\n\nThe executable downloaded by the shellcode is identical in its functionality to the executable\nattached to the email so we are eventually coming to PurchaseOrder.exe which will\neventually get executed whether the user opens the attached document or if they\nimmediately go for launching the PurchaseOrder.exe. The executable has a PDF document\nicon and the user can be forgiven for not recognizing it as an executable, considering the fact\nthat Windows by default hides filename extensions of the known file types.\n\n\n-----\n\nIcon file used by PurchaseOrder.exe.\n\nThe executable itself is just over 1.4MB in size, which is rather large for attachments used in\nemail campaigns. The file itself is a self-extractable CAB archive which contains three\nrandomly named files.\n\n## Stage 3 - AutoIt Script\n\nThe first file is instantly recognisable and it is a legitimate, Autoit script interpreter. The\nsecond file is a Unicode file encoded as UTF-16 and is over 110MB in size which is at first\nalmost enough to discourage from analysis. The actual script code starts deep within the file,\nwhich provides the attacker with the ability to obfuscate the script code in a way that is not\nimmediately visible by researchers.\n\nTalos has [already written about a similar delivery method in the past and it seems that this](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2015/08/malware-meets-sysadmin-automation-tools.html)\ncampaign uses a similar generator of obfuscated Autoit scripts. Thankfully, It was relatively\nsimple to remove all the junk characters and reduce the size of the code to analyze to a\nmuch more manageable 41KBs.\n\nAutoit stage deobfuscated\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Autoit script itself creates a directory in the user's profile folder and sets its attributes to\nsystem and hidden. It then creates a copy of RegSvcs.exe .NET services installation tool or\ncopies the existing RegSvcs.exe to a filename splwow64.exe to set up the next stage.\nRegscvcs.exe is used for injecting and launching a remote thread within its process space.\nThe thread uses RC4 to decrypt the third file dropped by the original self-extractable CAB\narchive and reads it into the process space of regsvcs.exe. This leads us to the next stage,\nusing an executable developed in C/C++. This stage will only exist in its executable format in\nmemory, while it will be an RC4 encrypted data blob on the disk.\n\n## Stage 4 - Zyklon injector\n\nThe stage injected into RegSvcs.exe is another unobfuscated injector of the final payload.\nThe executable decompresses the payload from the resource section of the PE file, finds\nand launches Windows Explorer executable that is found in different folders depending on\nthe Windows platform (32 or 64 bit) and launches a remote thread that loads and runs a\n.NET executable, which is the final payload of the campaign, in this case a sample of the\nZyklon HTTP bot.\n\nLoading managed code into an unmanaged space is not entirely simple process. Attempting\nto cheat the infection chain to launch the Zyklon bot from the command line was apparently\nanticipated by the campaign author who modified the Zyklon class Main function to display a\ntext message for anybody trying to launch it this way.\n\nThe original Zyklon code for the version 1.0.0.0 does not seem to contain this mechanism\nthat ensures that the payload is run by a specific loader that does not call the Zyklon Class\nMain function but a different entry point.\n\nYou are not supposed to run it this way\n\nThe payload is obfuscated using Crypto Obfuscator and an additional code generator. The\ncode which uses xor operations to set a value of a variable used in a switch statement to\ndirect the program flow is relatively easy to follow once the Crypto Obfuscator code\n\n\n-----\n\ntransformations are removed, which can be done using a very useful .NET deobfuscation\nutility [de4dot. In fact, the Zyklon Builder, found on VirusTotal, uses the same dnlib library,](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot)\n[used also by de4dot and dnspy analysis tools, to add the configuration file to the malicious](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy)\n.NET assembly base Zyklon bot embedded in its resource section.\n\nOnce the obfuscator was removed it did not take too long to realize that for the purpose of\nthe analysis it was possible to manually modify the Zyklon class Main function to call the\nEntryPoint function which contains the bot code and debug the Zyklon using the dnspy\ndebugger.\n\n## C2 communication (encryption)\n\nZyklon's \"official\" name is \"Zyklon H.T.T.P Bot\", which is visible in the links to PDB files\nretained as a remainder of the compilation process. The bot is reasonably well written with\nprecautions for hiding the traffic from network based detection engines, even from\nintercepting proxies by encrypting all its communications.\n\nEstablishing communication with a C2 server\n\nThe bot connects to one of the three possible C2 servers, starting from the first one specified\nin its configuration. The server sends a certificate and the communication is first encrypted\nwith RSA and then with a 256 bit long AES with the initialization vector and the key\ngenerated by the server, sent back to the client after the client POSTs a request ending with\nthe query gate.php?getkey=y.\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking at the DNS requests for one of the C2 servers that remained active throughout the\ncampaign it is possible to see the time when the campaign was active.\n\nC2 DNS domain activity\n\nThe initial configuration for the bot is embedded within the resource section of the file,\ntogether with the list of user agent strings used by the bot when contacting the C2 server.\nThe malicious .NET assembly also contains an encrypted blob that becomes its persistence\nmodule injector. Once decrypted and loaded in memory its function is to make sure that the\nbot is respawned from a remote thread if the main executable is terminated as a process.\n\nThe client then sends a request containing the information about the infected system and\nreceives a configuration string from C2, which sets the internal bot parameters. Several\nthreads are also launched in order to download and execute required additional plugins.\n\nThe main command loop sleeps for 60 seconds and sends a request for a command to the\nC2 server. The main purpose of the bot seems to be conducting DDoS attacks but there are\nother more or less standard commands available such as downloading and executing\nadditional payloads from a user-specified URL or logging the user keystrokes and sending\nthem back to the C2 server.\n\nCuriously, Zyklon may also attempt to enumerate the usual automatic startup locations in the\nWindows registry to find potential competitive files and submit them to VirusTotal for\nscanning. So called cloud malware inspection is used to terminate processes based on the\nVirusTotal verdict. The bot also executes rudimentary heuristic checks for some of the known\ncompetitive bot names and filename extensions and tries to remove them if found on the\nsystem. Competition is never welcome by the bad guys.\n\n## Zyklon website\n\nThe website advertising Zyklon is hosted on a onion domain which is also accessible from\n\n\n-----\n\nthe clear net through a web to Tor proxy. The owners are advertising two different versions\nfor sale, one that can connect to Tor based C2 servers and the standard one without that\ncapability.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting page of the Zyklon website are its Terms of Service, which the\nauthors seem to believe may free them from potential prosecution. The user, aka the\nattacker, allegedly has the sole legal responsibility for damage caused by it, at least\naccording to Zyklon creators :\n```\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY NOT AND\nWARRANT THAT YOU WILL NOT:\n1. use the Zyklon H.T.T.P Remote Administration Software for any illegal\npurpose, or in violation of any laws, including, without limitation, laws\ngoverning intellectual property, data protection and privacy, and import or\nexport control;\n2. remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with securityrelated features of the Zyklon H.T.T.P Remote Administration Software,\nfeatures that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible\nthrough the Zyklon H.T.T.P Remote Administration Software, or features that\nenforce limitations on use of the Zyklon H.T.T.P Remote Administration\nSoftware;\n3. intentionally interfere with or damage operation of the Zyklon H.T.T.P\nRemote Administration Software or any user's enjoyment of them, by any\nmeans, including uploading or otherwise disseminating viruses, worms, or\nother malicious code;\n4. post, store, send, transmit, or disseminate any information or material\nwhich infringes any patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, or any\nother proprietary or intellectual property rights;or\n5. Install and/or use Zyklon H.T.T.P Remote Administration Software on any\ncomputer which you do not have explicit permission to do so on;\n6. distribute Zyklon H.T.T.P files over the Internet with the intent of\ninfecting/harming machines of other people;\n\n## Downloaded credential harvesting modules (email, browser, ftp)\n\n```\nZyklon creators also advertise a number of useful plugins for harvesting user credentials and\nstealing confidential information such as details of wallets of various crypto currencies like\nBitcoin, LiteCoin and DodgeCoin. For a potential customer, the list of features must be quite\nimpressive. However, not everything is as ideal as it seems at first.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the analyzed campaign, the Zyklon main executable downloaded only three plugins, as\ninstructed by the C2 server, all of them with a purpose of stealing user credentials from\npassword caches of the most popular web browsers as well as email and ftp clients.\n```\nCI=False|KT=1|UAC=False|S5=False|ER=False|UPNP=False|RP=True|RW=False|\nAK=False|BK_CYCLE=|BK_RUN_ONCE=False|SOCKS_PORT=3128|SOCKS_AUTH=False|\nSOCKS_USERNAME=Nothing|SOCKS_PASSWORD=Nothing|KLI=1|KLM=500|EKL=True|\nWC=False|BA=MyBtc|LA=MyLtc|KLF=False|BR=True|FTR=True|EMR=True|SFR=False|\nGR=False|AU=False|UF=N/A|\n\n```\nConfiguration command sent to Zyklon from C2 server\n\nThe plugin download URL follows the format of plugin/index.php?plugin=<pluginname> with\npossible plugins being\n```\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=browser\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=email\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=ftp!\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=software\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=games\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=cuda\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=minerd\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=sgminer\n/plugin/index.php?plugin=socks\n\n```\nAvailable Zyklon plugins\n\nDownloaded plugins are injected into a previously launched and hollowed legitimate process\nname \"%windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\RegAsm.exe\" and are in fact just\nfreeware command line tools written in C/C++ available from the website\n[http://www.securityxploded.com.](http://www.securityxploded.com/)\n\nIt is likely that Zyklon author realized it would take quite a long time to fully develop all the\nfeatures within the main Zyklon bot and decided to include available free password dumping\nutilities just to make its RAT more competitive in what is quite a cutthroat underground\nmarket for remote administration tools.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nZyklon is quite a well known botnet kit and it has been fairly active this year. In this smaller,\npossibly more targeted campaign we analyzed, it has shown that its users are employing a\nnumber of different technologies and obfuscation techniques to be more successful - from\nexploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Word over Autoit scripts and .NET executables, all the\nway to freeware utilities used as plugins for harvesting credentials from browser cache, email\nand ftp clients.\n\n\n-----\n\nZyklon campaign execution flow on an endpoint\n\nOverall, this was a well executed campaign which used compromised hosts as C2 servers.\nLuckily, there are several weaknesses which can be exploited for detecting its footprint either\nby inspecting IOCs or tracking the network communications patterns and behavior on\nendpoints.\n\n## Coverage\n\n\n-----\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/amp-firepower-software-license/tsd-products-support-series-home.html)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n\n[CWS or](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html) [WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/web-security-appliance/index.html)\nused in these attacks.\n\n[Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n[Network Security appliances such as NGFW,](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/asa-next-generation-firewall-services/index.html) [NGIPS, and](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/intrusion-prevention-system-ips/index.html) [Meraki MX with Advanced](https://meraki.cisco.com/products/appliances)\nSecurity can detect malicious activity associated with this threat.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella prevents DNS resolution of the domains associated with malicious activity.](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\n\n[Stealthwatch detects network scanning activity, network propagation, and connections to](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/stealthwatch/index.html)\nCnC infrastructures, correlating this activity to alert administrators.\n\n## Iocs\n\nDocument exploits\n\nac944374d5f50ecbdd3b9e7151d5a4b055ec18ea26482c2301ccc439164b25be\n\n996b19658cffedc9395243693c3ca1d12a2c2a2c986e35a877f1ae2a2b595a6d\n\nPE Exes downloaded by the exploit docs\n\n4bce73a29ee1b9840cd82d8c08e107179cd74dc1aed488f6d16772ce12092c69\n\nbcf8dbbc78883b2d84511819123cf39b1c2ffe3cd9763d08fe1544c89084cadf\n\n\n-----\n\nZIP Attachments\ne67db2e2ebd3c540489dd4844b066b45f31b2d879a085eabda1f63926ddc0688\nb1906c1d23f62df7f63a06030f27c3249414d027a9deb62d27f65ec6f3a61adb\n\nPE exe files within ZIPs\nb7101462507a8cf5bf91b62b641ef1ac3d268115d6dfca54a1625efb07fccf0d\n4bce73a29ee1b9840cd82d8c08e107179cd74dc1aed488f6d16772ce12092c69\n\nBrowser plugin\ne5d2c3a7ddd219ab361af4a709999a492387e3aaf8380187a7699895fc383e40\n\nFTP plugin\n6a32a0d83a5c955822502444833283a3fde8e1893f1490fac1ae5b84a00db5c6\n\nEmail plugin\nbbcc07baaa00bb30de43a39a04dc66754fe805630f155fde47ab259fdbd03748\n\nZyklon Builder v1.0.0\n682d5d60d6fc0e1d5810e9cd9d8b1c6b6fa154d5a790da944177074d28846d66\n\nDownload URLs\nhttp://wszystkozmetalu[.]pl/Invoiceq.exe\nhttp://www.blcpolychemical[.]com/re/PurchaseOrders.exe\nhttp://barkliaytire[.]com\nhttp://distriegroupelectric[.]com\nhttp://extreime-net[.]com\nhttp://distriegroupelectric[.]com:80/plugin/index[.]php?plugin=ftp\nhttp://distriegroupelectric[.]com:80/plugin/index[.]php?plugin=email\nhttp://distriegroupelectric[.]com:80/plugin/index[.]php?plugin=browser\n\nC2\n\nhttp://distriegroupelectric.com:80/gate[.]php\nhttp://distriegroupelectric.com:80/login[.]php - Control Panel\n\n\n-----",
