The LockBit 2.0 operators claimed to have the fastest encryption software of any\n\n\n-----\n\nactive ransomware strain as of June 2021, claiming accordingly that this added to its\neffectiveness and ability to disrupt the ransomware landscape.\n\n[While several top-tier RaaS affiliate programs, such as Babuk, DarkSide and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/darkside-ransomware/) [REvil (aka](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/revil-threat-actors/)\nSodinokibi) disappeared from the underground in 2021, LockBit 2.0 continued to operate and\ngradually became one of the most active ransomware operations. While Conti was\nrecognized as being the most prolific ransomware deployed in 2021 per our 2022 Unit 42\nRansomware Threat Report, LockBit 2.0 is the most impactful and widely deployed\nransomware variant we have observed in all ransomware breaches during the first quarter of\n2022, considering both leak site data and data from cases handled by Unit 42 incident\nresponders.\n\nAccording to data analysis of ransomware groups’ dark web leak sites, LockBit 2.0 was the\nmost impactful RaaS for five consecutive months. As of May 25, LockBit 2.0 accounted for\n46% of all ransomware-related breach events for 2022. And the LockBit 2.0 RaaS leak site\nhas the most significant number of published victims, with over 850 in total.\n\nAdditionally, LockBit 2.0 has affected many companies globally, with top victims based in the\nU.S., Italy and Germany. Its most highly targeted industry verticals include professional\nservices, construction, wholesale and retail, and manufacturing.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections against LockBit 2.0 attacks from Cortex\nXDR, as well as from the WildFire cloud-delivered security subscription for the NextGeneration Firewall. (Please see the Conclusion section for more detail.)\n\nRelated Unit 42 Topics [Ransomware,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/ransomware/) [Ransomware Threat Report](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/2022-ransomware-threat-report-highlights/)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nLockBit 2.0 Overview\n\nVictimology\n\nLeak Site Data\n\nUnit 42 Incident Response Data on LockBit 2.0\n\nLockBit 2.0 Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\nLockBit 2.0 Technical Details\n\nLockBit 3.0\n\nCourses of Action\n\nConclusion\n\nAppendix A\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n## LockBit 2.0 Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nLockBit 2.0 is another example of RaaS that leverages double extortion techniques as part of\nthe attack to pressure victims into paying the ransom.\n\nIn some cases, LockBit 2.0 operators have performed DDoS attacks on the victims'\ninfrastructure as well as using a leak site. This practice is known as triple extortion, a tactic\nobserved in groups like BlackCat, Avaddon and SunCrypt in the past.\n\n[Like other ransomware families such as BlackByte, LockBit 2.0 avoids systems that use](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/blackbyte-ransomware/)\nEastern European languages, including many written with Cyrillic alphabets.\n\nUnlike other RaaS programs that don't require the affiliates to be super technical or savvy,\nLockBit 2.0 operators allegedly only work with experienced penetration testers, especially\n[those experienced with tools like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike. Affiliates are tasked with](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/cobalt-strike/)\ngaining initial access to the victim network, allowing LockBit 2.0 to conduct the rest of the\nattack.\n\nLockBit 2.0 has been observed changing infected computers’ backgrounds to a ransomware\nnote. The ransomware note was also used to recruit insiders from victim organizations. The\nnotes claimed the threat actors would pay “millions of dollars” to insiders who provided\naccess to corporate networks or facilitated a ransomware infection by opening a phishing\nemail and/or launching a payload manually. The threat actors also expressed interest in\nother access methods such as RDP, VPN and corporate email credentials. In exchange, they\noffer a cut of the paid ransom.\n\n### Victimology\n\nLockBit 2.0 targets organizations opportunistically. The operators work with initial access\nbrokers to save time and allow for a larger profit potential. While typically seeking victims of\nopportunity, LockBit 2.0 does appear to have victim limitations. The group announced that\nthey would not target healthcare facilities, social services, educational institutions, charitable\norganizations and other organizations that “contribute to the survival of the human race”.\nHowever, despite these claims, there have been instances of affiliates undermining these\nguidelines by still opting to attack industry verticals such as healthcare and education.\n\nOrganizations in Europe and the U.S. are hit more often by LockBit 2.0 than those in other\ncountries, likely due to the high profitability and insurance payouts.\n\n### Leak Site Data\n\nDuring the first calendar year quarter of 2022, LockBit 2.0 persisted as the most impactful\nand the most deployed ransomware variant we observed in all ransomware breaches shared\non leak sites.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Ransomware leak site data from the first calendar year quarter of 2022.\nAccording to leak site data analysis, LockBit 2.0 was the most impactful RaaS for five\nconsecutive months. As of May 25, LockBit 2.0 accounted for 46% of all ransomware-related\nbreach events for 2022 shared on leak sites.\n\nAdditionally, the LockBit 2.0 RaaS leak site has the most significant number of published\nvictims, with over 850 in total. The site itself typically features information such as victim\ndomains, a time tracker and measures of how much data was compromised.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. LockBit 2.0 leak site extortion site.\nLockBit 2.0 [claims that they have demanded ransom from at least 12,125 companies, as](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1523323798266785792)\nshown in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Source: VX-underground.\nAccording to leak site data for LockBit 2.0, since its inception in June 2021, the RaaS has\naffected many companies globally, with top victims based in the U.S., Italy and Germany.\n\nFigure 4. LockBit 2.0 geographical impact chart.\nLockBit 2.0 has also impacted various victims across multiple industry verticals. Its most\nhighly targeted industry verticals include professional services, construction, wholesale and\nretail and manufacturing.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. LockBit 2.0 impacted industry vertical chart.\nWhen looking at leak site data across all ransomware families, we’ve observed LockBit 2.0\ntargeting the highest number of organizations in the following regions: JAPAC, EMEA, and\nLATAM.\n\n### Unit 42 Incident Response Data on LockBit 2.0\n\nCases handled by Unit 42 security consultants involving LockBit 2.0 since its appearance in\nJune 2021 demonstrate shorter dwell times and less flexibility in negotiation in the beginning\nof FY 2022 (measured October-September) in comparison to the end of FY 2021. The\nfollowing data is broken into fiscal years and quarters based on when the threat actor\nbreached the network, not when the activity was noticed by a client.\n\nLockBit 2.0 has shown a decrease in dwell time in FY 2022. From the last two quarters of FY\n2021 to the first two quarters of FY 2022, there has been an average 37-day difference.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. LockBit 2.0 average dwell time by fiscal quarter.\nThe difference in initial and final ransom demands over the past fiscal year has been\nconverted to percentages and then averaged. The graph below demonstrates that at the end\nof FY 2021, threat actors using LockBit 2.0 were much more open to negotiations of ransom\namounts; during that time the ransom was dropped approximately 83% from the initial ask on\naverage. In comparison, we see less flexibility in FY 2022 Q1 and Q3 – threat actors only\noffered an average of about 30% as a price drop. FY 2022 Q2 is not included due to lack of\nsufficient information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. LockBit 2.0 average difference in initial vs final ransom amount, shown as\npercentages.\n\n## LockBit 2.0 Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\nTechnically speaking, we have observed LockBit 2.0 affiliates leveraging the following tactics,\ntechniques and procedures:\n\n**TA0001 Initial**\n**Access**\n\n\nT1078 Valid\nAccounts\n\nT1133 External\nRemote Services\n\nT1190 Exploit PublicFacing Applications\n\n**TA0002 Execution**\n\nT1053.005\nScheduled Task/Job\n\n\nCredentials that have either been reused across multiple platforms\nor have previously been exposed. Additionally, this includes VPN\naccounts – not just domain and local accounts.\n\nAffiliates have been seen brute forcing exposed RDP services and\ncompromising accounts with weak passwords.\n\nVulnerabilities such as ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473) and\nimproper SQL sanitization (CVE-2021-20028) have been observed\nbeing utilized as footholds into the environment.\n\nScheduled Task. LockBit 2.0 can be executed via scheduled tasks.\n\n\n-----\n\nT1059 Command\nand Scripting\nInterpreter\n\n**TA0003 Persistence**\n\nT1053.005\nScheduled Task/Job\n\nT1078 Valid\nAccounts\n\nT1136.001 Create\nAccount\n\nT1505.003 Server\nSoftware\nComponent\n\n**TA0004 Privilege**\n**Escalation**\n\nT1068 Exploitation\nfor Privilege\nEscalation\n\nT1548.002 Abuse\nElevation Control\nMechanism: Bypass\nUser Account\nControl\n\n**TA0005 Defense**\n**Evasion**\n\nT1070 Indicator\nRemoval on Host\n\nT1140\nDeobfuscate/Decode\nFiles or Information\n\n\nLockBit 2.0 is typically executed via command line arguments via a\nhidden window.\nWindows SysInternals PsExec has been utilized for both\npersistence and execution purposes. Its ability to execute\nprocesses on other systems spread the ransomware and assisted\nin reconnaissance activities.\n\nScheduled Task. It was quite common to see scheduled tasks used\nto create persistence for the ransomware executable, PsExec, and\noccasionally some defense evasion batch scripts.\n\nCompromised accounts may be used to maintain access to the\nnetwork.\n\nIn rare cases, LockBit 2.0 has been observed to create accounts\nfor persistence with simple names, such as “a.”\n\nWith the upsurgence of ProxyShell, webshells have become more\ncommon entry points.\n\nThe ProxyShell elevation of privilege on the Exchange PowerShell\nBackend (CVE-2021-34523), Windows Background Intelligent\nTransfer Service (BITS) improperly handling symbolic links (CVE2020-0787), and abusing the CMSTPLUA COM interface have all\nbeen seen as methods of privilege escalation.\n\nLockBit 2.0 has utilized a UAC bypass tool.\n\nIndicators, such as logs in Windows Event Logs or malicious files,\nare typically removed using wevtutil, a batch script, or CCleaner.\n\nMost PowerShell scripts involved in LockBit 2.0 cases are Base64\nencoded.\n\n\n-----\n\nT1484.001 Domain\nPolicy Modification:\nGroup Policy\nModification\n\nT1562.001 Impair\nDefenses: Disable or\nModify Tools\n\nT1564.003 Hide\nArtifacts: Hidden\nWindow\n\n**TA0006 Credential**\n**Access**\n\nT1003 OS\nCredential Dumping\n\nT1555 Credentials\nfrom Password\nStores\n\n**TA0007 Discovery**\n\nT1046 Network\nService Discovery\n\nT1057 Process\nDiscovery\n\nT1082 System\nInformation\nDiscovery\n\nT1614 System\nLocation Discovery\n\n**TA00008 Lateral**\n**Movement**\n\nT1021 Remote\nServices\n\n\nLockBit 2.0 has been seen using the PowerShell module\nInvokeGPUpdate to update the group policy.\n\nWindows Defender, other anti-malware solutions and monitoring\ntools are disabled utilizing a process explorer tool, a batch script or\na specially crafted command line script.\n\nAffiliates use hidden windows to hide malicious activity from plain\nsight.\n\nAs seen with other ransomware cases, Mimikatz is a key player in\ndumping credentials but LockBit 2.0 has been occasionally seen\nutilizing MiniDump as well.\n\nLockBit 2.0 has been seen utilizing numerous tools to dump\npasswords from password stores and Chrome using GrabChrome\nand GrabRFF.\n\nBoth Advanced Port Scanner and NetScan have been used to\ndiscover local network infrastructure devices and services running\non remote hosts. Active Directory queries for remote systems have\nbeen performed by ADFind.\n\nProcess Explorer, Process Monitor and PCHunter have been\nutilized to discover any anti-malware or monitoring software and\nterminate it.\n\nLockBit 2.0 enumerates system information such as hostname,\nshares, and domain information.\n\nAttempts to check the language settings.\n\nAlthough Cobalt Strike has many capabilities beneficial to threat\nactors in ransomware attacks, it was mainly seen in LockBit 2.0\ninvestigations acting as a command and control beacon, a method\nof lateral movement and a tool for downloading/executing files.\n\n\n-----\n\nT1021.002 Remote\nServices:\nSMB/Windows\nAdmin Shares\n\n**TA0010 Exfiltration**\n\nT1030 Data Transfer\nSize Limits\n\nT1041 Exfiltration\nover C2 Channel\n\n**TA0011 Command**\n**and Control**\n\nT1219 Remote\nAccess Software\n\n**TA0040 Impact**\n\nT1486 Data\nEncrypted for Impact\n\n\nLockBit 2.0 has been known to self-propagate via SMB.\n\nIn some cases, LockBit 2.0 will limit the data transfer sizes to fly\nunder the radar of any monitoring services a client may have set\nup.\n\nMEGASync is the leading way for LockBit 2.0 affiliates to exfiltrate\ndata from clients with it being occasionally replaced by RClone.\n\nAnyDesk has been the most common legitimate desktop software\nused to establish an interactive command and control channel, with\nConnectWise seen slightly less frequently.\n\nLockBit 2.0 is known for its extortion tactics, encrypting devices\nand demanding a ransom.\n\n\nT1489 Service Stop During the defense evasion phase, anti-malware and monitoring\nsoftware is often disabled. Firewall rules have occasionally been\nseen being disabled as well.\n\n## LockBit 2.0 Technical Details\n\nLockBit 2.0 was developed using the Assembly and Origin C programming languages and\nleverages advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)\nalgorithms to encrypt victim data. It can affect both Windows and Linux OS, as the operator\nreleased a Linux version of LockBit 2.0 to target VMware ESXi hypervisor systems in\nOctober 2021, coded exclusively in the C programming language.\n\nThe LockBit group claimed that LockBit 2.0 is “the fastest encryption software all over the\nworld” and provided a comparative table showing the encryption speed of various\nransomware samples.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. LockBit encryption comparative table | Source: LockBit blog.\nLockBit 2.0 also contains a self-spreading feature, clears logs and can print the ransom note\non network printers until the paper runs out.\n\nA management panel that affiliates can use to manage victims and affiliate accounts,\ngenerate new ransomware builds and generate the decryptor if the demanded ransom is\npaid also exists.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. LockBit 2.0 management panel. Source: ProDaft.\nLockBit 2.0 operators also released an information-stealer dubbed StealBit, which was\ndeveloped to support affiliates of the LockBit 2.0 RaaS when exfiltrating data from breached\ncompanies.\n\nStealBit contains the following capabilities:\n\nOperates as a file grabber and dumps/uploads victim data to the LockBit victimshaming site.\nNo reliance on third-party cloud file-sharing services, where data can be easily\nremoved if the victim submitted a complaint.\nThe download speed is limited only by internet connection bandwidth, so it is possible\nto clone folders from corporate networks and upload them to the LockBit victim\nshaming blog quickly.\n\nThe operator of LockBit 2.0 has provided a comparative table speed showing the information\nstealer compared to other tools.\n\nFigure 10. LockBit 2.0 download speed, according to LockBit 2.0 operator.\n\n\n-----\n\n## LockBit 3.0\n\nThere was a bug that existed in LockBit 2.0 that allowed researchers to revert the encryption\nprocess on an MSSQL database. After the bug’s disclosure, LockBit forum members\ndiscussed how the bug will not exist in LockBit’s next iteration. Moreover, on March 17,\nLockBit forum members mentioned the release of LockBit’s next version in one or two weeks.\n[On March 25, VX underground posted a tweet with details of this new version, dubbed](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1528801206923141122)\nLockBit Black.\n\nFigure 11.

With\nclaims of this RaaS offering the fastest encryption on the ransomware market, coupled with\nthe fact that it has been delivered in high volume by experienced affiliates, this RaaS poses a\nsignificant threat. LockBit’s continuation with operations and its next iteration coming up on\nthe horizon means that organizations and their security teams need to stay vigilant in the\never-evolving threat landscape.\n\nPalo Alto Networks detects and prevents LockBit 2.0 ransomware in the following ways:\n\n[WildFire: All known samples are identified as malware.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\n[Cortex XDR:](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n\nIdentifies indicators associated with LockBit 2.0.\nAnti-Ransomware Module to detect LockBit 2.0 encryption behaviors on\nWindows.\nLocal Analysis detection for LockBit 2.0 binaries on Windows.\n[Next-Generation Firewalls: DNS Signatures detect the known C2 domains, which are](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\n[also categorized as malware in Advanced URL Filtering.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering)\n\nIf you think you may have been compromised or have an urgent matter, get in touch with the\n[Unit 42 Incident Response team or call:](http://start.paloaltonetworks.com/contact-unit42.html)\n\nNorth America Toll-Free: 866.486.4842 (866.4.UNIT42)\nEMEA: +31.20.299.3130\nAPAC: +65.6983.8730\nJapan: +81.50.1790.0200\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared these findings, including file samples and indicators of\ncompromise, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.

The team selected targets for ransomware attacks based on\nthe company’s finances — the bigger, the better. The location also did not matter.\nHowever, team members allegedly did not attack healthcare facilities, social services,\neducational institutions and charitable organizations or any other organization that\n“contributed to the survival of the human race.” [Note that Unit 42 case data does\ninclude indications that threat actors using LockBit 2.0 have targeted healthcare\norganizations at times.]\nThe threat actor claimed that the largest number of victims who paid ransom were\ncompany representatives who did not care about creating backup copies and did not\nprotect their sensitive data. According to the threat actor’s claims, companies that\nviolated regulations about collecting and handling customer or user personal\ninformation were among those eager to pay. The threat actor claimed that there\ngenerally were only a few companies who refused to pay ransom on principle, while\nmost of the victims evaluated profit and loss to decide whether or not to pay a ransom.\nLockBit 2.0 operators allegedly almost always offered discounts to their victims since\nthe goal was to streamline attacks.\nThe threat actor claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated ransomware attacks\nsignificantly, saying it was easy to compromise home computers of employees who\nwork remotely and use them as a springboard to access other networked systems.\nCompanies in Europe and the U.S. were hit with ransomware much more often than\ncompanies based in other countries allegedly because of high profit and insurance and\nnot because of language barriers.\nRansomware operators usually recruit negotiators, who coerce victims to pay ransom,\nsince professional penetration testers allegedly lack the time for chatter.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n\n-----\n\n[LockBit 3.0: Another Upgrade to the World s Most Active Ransomware](https://socradar.io/lockbit-3-another-upgrade-to-worlds-most-active-ransomware/)\n[Ransomware Groups to Watch: Emerging Threats](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emerging-ransomware-groups/)\n[Average Ransom Payment Up 71% This Year, Approaches $1 Million](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2022/06/average-ransomware-payment-update/)\n[2022 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report Highlights](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/2022-ransomware-threat-report-highlights/)\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
