As the security incident took place, the company](http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e201104.html)\nstopped some operations on its internal networks, likely to prevent the cyberattack from spreading further and potentially compromising\nadditional corporate resources.\n\nCapcom claims that there is \"no indication\" that customer information has been accessed or compromised; at least, at this stage.\n\n\"This incident has not affected connections for playing the company's games online or access to its various websites,\" the company said.\n\"Capcom expressed its deepest regret for any inconvenience this may cause to its various stakeholders.\"\n\n**CNET:** [Election still too close to call: How to spot misinformation while you wait for results](https://www.cnet.com/news/election-still-too-close-to-call-how-to-spot-misinformation-while-you-wait-for-results/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)\n\nAt the time of writing, Capcom says it is \"unable to reply to inquiries and/or to fulfill requests for documents\" made through the investor\n[relations contact form.](http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/inquiry/)\n\nThe game developer is currently working toward restoring its systems and has reported the cyberattack to law enforcement.\n\n**TechRepublic:** [It's an urgent plea this Election Day: Don't click on ransomware disguised as political ads](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/its-an-urgent-plea-this-election-eve-dont-click-on-ransomware-disguised-as-political-ads/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)\n\nCapcom has not revealed any further details relating to the attack, but the company is not the only game developer targeted this year.
