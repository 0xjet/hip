The decision follows recent fraud involving Japanese bank\naccounts linked to cashless payments services, which could be achieved by brute-forcing,\nusing compromised credentials to banking accounts or via other attack vectors. Attacks on\nthe banking infrastructure is just a part of threats targeting Japanese organizations, recently\nexplored by KELA. They include:\n\n**Leaked data and compromised accounts. KELA detected that data belonging to**\nJapanese corporations, as well as government and educational entities, is actively\ncirculating in the darknet and being demanded by threat actors. This data can be used\nto gain initial network accesses, i.e. entry points to targeted networks.\n**Initial network accesses. KELA observed several Japanese compromised**\ncompanies, ranging from corporations to universities, including one Japan ministry\ntarget during June-October 2020. These accesses can be leveraged to eventually\ndeploy ransomware.\n**Ransomware incidents. KELA detected at least 11 Japanese victims of ransomware**\nattacks in June-October 2020. The affected companies are from manufacturing,\nconstruction and government-related industries, with top victims having around $143\nbillion, $33 billion and $2 billion yearly revenue.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Leaked Data and Compromised Accounts: Demand for Japanese Companies\n\nAmong the most prominent threats on the darknet, KELA observed leaks and sales of\nJapanese entities’ data. While many offers are related to regular users, some actors are\n**specifically looking for corporate data of Japanese organizations.**\n\n**_A threat actor requesting for corporate emails in Asian countries, including Japan_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_A threat actor requesting for fresh Japan databases. During several days, he received three_**\n**_answers from potential sellers asking for contacts to probably make a deal_**\n\nExposed data may include personal information of companies’ customers and employees,\nsensitive internal documents, and credentials to the company’s resources. For example, the\nKelvinSecurityTeam hacking group has been trading a database of a major Japan\ncorporation since July 2020. It has been recently promoted again as a part of their offers.\n\nThe threat actor claimed that the database contains records of 150,000 customers, possibly\nJapanese ones. As KELA observed from samples of the database, the records include\nnames, addresses, birth dates, emails, and phone numbers, as well as some data related to\ntheir work history. KelvinSecurityTeam is a hacking collective with some members from\nVenezuela, Peru, and Colombia, which is known for selling hacking tools, carding services,\nand private data dumps on forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n**While personal information and internal documents require malicious actors to**\n**perform multiple steps to attack the company further (for example, via specially-**\n**crafted phishing campaigns), exposed credentials provide an easier way to**\n**compromise the company via accessing its internal systems and software in use.**\n\nExposed credentials can be divided into two types:\n\n**Leaked credentials. Corporate email logins, with or without passwords, which are**\nusually being leaked or sold by threat actors on underground forums. Overall, KELA\n**discovered more than 100 million exposed Japanese emails in our sources.**\n**Compromised accounts. Logins and passwords to accounts that grant access to**\ntools and software used in a compromised environment, such as RDP, VPN solutions,\nand more, which are usually being sold through underground autoshops.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Top 10 email domains featured in leaked credentials gathered by KELA’s tools from cybercrime_**\n**_communities_**\n\n**_Part of compromised accounts offered in autoshops (shown within KELA’s DARKBEAST)_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis data can enable attackers to access the company’s resources and provide further\nmalicious activity, ranging from social engineering to malware attacks. Ultimately, every\n**leaked data can theoretically become an entry point for large-scale attacks.**\n\nBased on information gathered from multiple darknet sources that KELA tracks, we defined\nthat many Japanese corporations, as well as government and educational entities, are\nsuffering significantly from these types of threats:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Network Accesses: Entry Points to Japanese Networks for Ransomware Attackers\n\nInitial network accesses, offered on underground forums, can serve as entry points for\nransomware operators and other malicious actors looking for a foothold from where they can\nmove laterally and deploy ransomware or steal intellectual property. Over the last three\nmonths, KELA observed several accesses to Japanese organizations being sold in the\ndarknet. While overall numbers are lower than other countries like the US, considering the\nscale of initial network accesses’ sales, each of these accesses can be turned into\n**millions of ransom demanded by buyers who would manage to leverage them to infect**\n**the victims with ransomware.**\n\nThe most dangerous offer appears to be related to a remote code execution vulnerability in\nthe Japanese Ministry of Justice network. According to a threat actor who posted the offer for\n210,000 JPY, exploiting this vulnerability could grant NT Authority/System privileges,\nmeaning a high level of permissions.\n\nAnother access on sale during the last months allegedly belonged to a “Japan ship\ninspection network” and had domain admin level privileges, which enables attackers to\nperform malicious actions on behalf of the targeted network’s administrator. It was offered for\n157,000 JPY. Interestingly, one week later, the Sodinokibi (REvil) ransomware gang attacked\na victim which appears to be the same company based on the description on the victim’s\nwebsite — “certification body of ship equipment.” However, it’s not known if the two incidents\n\n\n-----\n\nwere related. Ransomware operators usually wait for negotiations deadlines to expire\n**before exposing a victim on their blogs, so it’s hardly possible they would manage**\n**both to attack the victim and lose patience for one week.**\n\n**_Access to the Japanese “ship inspection network” offered for sale_**\n\n_Sodinokibi’s victim_\n\n\n-----\n\nAmong other offers, KELA observed access to a Japanese medical university being offered\nfor 105,000 JPY. The example highlights that despite the pandemic and the disapproval\n**of some members of the underground community, many actors continue to target** **the**\n**healthcare industry, as well as** **[the education sector.](https://ke-la.com/back-to-school-why-cybercriminals-continue-to-target-the-education-sector-2/)**\n\n## Ransomware Incidents: (At Least) Seven Gangs Targeting Japanese Organizations\n\n**During June-October 2020, at least 11 Japanese victims suffered ransomware attacks**\n(based on the media reports and data on ransomware gangs’ “naming-and-shaming” portals\nused to threaten victims, monitored by KELA technology), with the most well-known victims\n[being Honda and](https://www.honda.co.jp/content/dam/site/www/investors/cq_img/library/report/FY202003_yuho_j.pdf) [Canon.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/canon-confirms-ransomware-attack-in-internal-memo/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**The most active ransomware gang targeting Japanese entities appears to be the**\n**DoppelPaymer gang. The DoppelPaymer ransomware emerged in 2019 and is believed to**\nhave links with former members of the TA505 hacking group. This group has recently\nattacked four large Japanese companies from the construction, automotive and\nmanufacturing industries, including a corporation with $1 Billion in revenue, as well as a\nGerman subsidiary of a leading manufacturer of specialty paper in Japan. Interestingly, one\nof the victims of DoppelPaymer was later claimed to be attacked by Conti, a new\nransomware operation that started in August 2020 and believed to be associated with the\nRyuk ransomware.\n\n_DoppelPaymer’s leak blog featuring a Japanese manufacturing company with $153 million revenue_\n\nOther ransomware gangs spotted attacking Japanese entities are well-known Maze,\nSodinokibi and Ekans (Snake), and two ransomware operations that have recently adopted a\ntactic of public shaming – Egregor and LockBit.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Maze’s leak site featuring a full dump of stolen documents belonging to a Japanese manufacturing_**\n**_company_**\n\nNot much is known about initial infection vectors used to compromise networks of Japanese\nvictims. However, it’s clear that the attack surface is expanding due to COVID-19-related\nissues and increasing trend for remote working, meaning that more and more employees are\nusing vulnerable software and exposed credentials to access corporate networks remotely.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Business enterprises in Japan that implemented home office for employees after the outbreak of COVID-_\n_[19 (source: Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1103444/japan-share-companies-implemented-remote-work-coronavirus-outbreak/)_\n\nFor example, one Japanese victim, a manufacturing company, was probably attacked\n**by LockBit using exploit code for a Pulse Secure vulnerability (CVE-2019-11510). The**\nclue stems from the fact that the company’s IP address was included in a leak posted on a\ncybercrime community containing details and credentials of over 900 enterprise Pulse\nSecure servers exploited by threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe victim was first shared by LockBit in their thread on a Russian-speaking underground\nforum with a domain that had a Chinese TLD, which could indicate it is a Chinese branch\nthat was attacked. When LockBit started their blog a few days later, the victim appeared\nthere without domains mentioned.\n\n**_A post in LockBit’s thread, where the ransomware gang is recruiting affiliates, on a Russian-_**\n**_speaking underground forum_**\n\n**The Pulse Secure leak, for which additional directories were shared several days later,**\n**possibly affects about 117 Japanese entities, based on KELA’s analysis of the IP**\n**addresses. Darknet chatter on the matter shows that this information has been**\n**circulated between malicious actors before the leak that happened in August 2020.**\nTherefore, credentials to affected Japanese organizations’ Pulse Secure servers could be\nused by different actors in their malicious campaigns, including ransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Part of Japanese entities contained in the Pulse Secure leak (KELA’s document based on the_**\n**_leaked directory)_**\n\n## Conclusions and Mitigation Efforts\n\nAs can be concluded from this research, more and more threat actors, Advanced APT group\nand nation state actors are considering Japanese organizations as valuable targets and are\nactively attacking them via opportunistic and targeted attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the latest work from home trend and the increased attack surface, KELA has\nobserved many commercial and governmental Japanese entities being recently attacked by\nknown actors – from ransomware gangs to nation-state actors and other financially\nmotivated groups. They’re using multiple attack vectors aimed to compromise Japanese\nentities, gain a foothold into their network and steal sensitive information and funds.\n\nKELA strongly believes that real-time monitoring of darknet communities for both supply and\ndemand can hold significant intelligence value for Japanese defenders. It enables Japanese\nentities to be more proactive to threats, learn about new tactics used by malicious actors,\nand take measures to protect against them.\n\nIn our next blog post, we will cover the Japanese financial ecosystem and the opportunities\nthreat actors see in targeting both the consumer and the organizations’ sides.\n\n\n-----",
