The operation has amassed a steady stream of victims across the world. Play\nhas recently been in the news for attacking Argentina’s Judiciary of Cordoba and the\nGerman hotel chain “H-Hotels”. Play’s attacks focus on organizations in the Latin American\nregion – Brazil being their primary target. They have also been observed deploying attacks\non India, Hungary, Spain, and the Netherlands.\n\nPlay is known for their big game hunting tactics, such as using Cobalt Strike for postcompromise and SystemBC RAT for persistence. They have recently started exploiting the\nProxyNotShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange. The group also has similar tactics and\ntechniques to the ransomware groups Hive and Nokoyawa, leading researchers to believe\nPlay is operated by the same people. Let’s take a look at Play ransomware, their tactics and\ntechniques, as well as how organizations can protect themselves from this kind of threat\nactor.\n\n\n-----\n\n## play ransomware\n\nPlay was discovered in June 2022 after several victims of their ransomware attacks\nappeared in Bleeping Computer forums. Play’s ransomware name stems from its behavior,\nas the extension .play is added after file encryption. The ransomware note left behind also\ncontains the single word PLAY, as well as the group’s contact email address.\n\nNot long after victims started reporting attacks in Bleeping Computer forums, Play targeted\nArgentina’s Judiciary of Cordoba. The attack took place in August 2022 and the Judiciary\nhad to shut down their IT systems, as well as their online portal as a result. The Judiciary\nwas forced to use pen and paper for submitting official documents. The Argentinian\npublication, Clarin, reported that the attack was the “worst attack on public institutions in\nhistory.”\n\nImage 1: Play Ransomware Activity Compared to Other Ransomware Groups\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the Judiciary did not go into detail, journalist Luis Ernest Zegarra confirmed via\nTwitter that the Judiciary was hit by ransomware that appends the .play extension to\nencrypted files. The ransomware note that Play leaves behind is not lengthy and is unusually\nsimple. The note is only made at the root of a hard dive (C:\\) and only contains the word\n**PLAY and an email address for victims to contact. This kind of simplicity is not usual for**\nransomware operators.\n\nImage 2: Encrypted Files\n\n_Source: Bleeping Computer_\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough not confirmed, researchers suspect that Play was able to breach the Judiciary via a\nlist of leaked Globant employee email addresses. The attack on Globant took place in March\n2022 and the leaked email addresses may have allowed Play to launch a phishing attack to\nsteal credentials.\n\nImage 3: Globant's Breach\n\n_Source: Twitter_\n\n## tactics & techniques\n\n### PROXYNOTSHELL\n\nTowards the end of December 2022, Play was observed using a method to exploit two\n[ProxyNotShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft exchange to gain initial access in environments.](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/microsoft-patches-zero-days)\nThe ProxyNotShell flaws are:\n\n**CVE-2022-41040 – Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability**\n\n\n-----\n\n**CVE-2022-41082 – Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**\n\nThe flaws impact Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019. If successful, an attacker could\nexploit ProxyNotShell to elevate privileges to run PowerShell in the context of the system,\ngaining arbitrary or remote code execution on vulnerable servers. Although the vulnerabilities\nwere patched by Microsoft in November 2022, Play was able to bypass URL rewrite\nmitigations for the Autodiscover endpoint implemented by Microsoft.\n\nNext, Play was able to leverage legitimate Plink and AnyDesk executables to maintain\naccess. They also performed anti-forensics techniques on the server, attempting to hide their\nactivity. The security researchers at CrowdStrike investigated several Play ransomware\nintrusions where they suspected the threat actors used ProxyNotShell as their entry vector.\nHowever, after analyzing and after reviewing their logs, they determined that there was no\nevidence of exploitation of CVE-2022-41040 for initial access but “corresponding requests\nwere made directly through the Outlook Web Application (OWA) endpoint - signifying a\npreviously undisclosed exploit method for Exchange.”\n\nAccording to Security Affairs, a security researcher from Huntress Labs discovered Play’s\ntool set and shared it through MegaUpload. The tools include a Python script “poc.py”\n(which led CrowdStrike to replicate the logs generated in recent Play ransomware attacks).\n\n### CONNECTIONS TO OTHER GROUPS\n\nAs previously stated, Play’s name originated from the .play extension that is added after\n[encrypting files. The threat actors have similar behavior and tactics to HIVE and Nokoyawa](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/hive-ransomware-attacks-analysis)\nransomware. The threat actor was observed using similar file names and file paths of their\nrespective tools and payloads. Trend Micro also found evidence hinting that the operators\nbehind Nokoyawa are associated with the operators behind HIVE, as there are many\nsimilarities between their attack chains.\n\nOne of the ways that Play is set apart from [HIVE and Nokoyawa is through their use of](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/an-update-on-hive-ransomware)\nAdFind – a command-line query tool which collects information from Active Directory (AD).\nHIVE has been observed using tools such as the TrojanSpy.DATASPY trojan to gather victim\ninformation. Play, HIVE, and Nokoyawa may not share all the same indicators, but their\nshared tactics and tools indicate that they are affiliated in some way.\n\n[Trend Micro also found evidence of a possible connection between Play and Quantum](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/an-in-depth-look-at-quantum-ransomware)\nransomware. Quantum is known for being a splinter group of Conti. The ransomware\noperation was taken over by Conti Team Two in April 2022, but the group kept Quantum’s\noriginal name. Quantum is also known for employing their version of BazarCall, called\nJormungandr, and hiring people who specialize in OSINT, spamming, design, and call center\noperations.\n\n\n-----\n\nTrend Micro s researchers stated that the Cobalt Strike beacons used in Play s attacks, have\n[the same watermark that was dropped by the Emotet and SVCReady botnets – two botnets](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/an-in-depth-look-at-emotet-botnet)\nthat have been observed in Quantum ransomware attacks.\n\nImage 4: Play Infection Train\n\n_Source: Trend Micro_\n\nAs you can see above, Play’s infection chain includes using compromised valid accounts or\nunpatched Fortinet SSL VPN vulnerabilities to gain access to organization’s networks. They\nuse living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) during their attacks (i.e., using WinSCP for data\nexfiltration and Task Manger for Local Security Authority Server Service for dumping and\ncredential cracking). Like other ransomware gangs, Play uses the double extortion model\nagainst their victims. The threat actor exfiltrates data before deploying their ransomware and\narchives the victim’s files using WinRAR before uploading them to sharing sites.\n\nRegarding execution, Trend Micro observed Play using scheduled tasks and PsExec during\nexecution. The ransomware gang also creates a GPO, which can control user and machine\nsettings in the AD. Play uses batch files to execute PsExec, which executes processes on\nother systems and allows the spread of the ransomware. This also assists Play in its\nreconnaissance activities.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter gaining access to accounts, Play uses the accounts as a persistence mechanism. If\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is disabled on their victim’s system, Play will enable it by\nexecuting “netsh” commands – establishing inbound connects within the victim’s system.\nNext Mimikatz is used to extract high privilege credentials from memory. To avoid detection,\nGMER, IOBit, Process Hacker, and PowerTool is used to disable antivirus tools and\nmonitoring solutions. Wevtutil or a batch script is used to remove indicators that show Play\nwas present in a system, while Windows Defender is disabled through PowerShell or\ncommand script.\n\nPlay uses the following tools to move laterally across a victim’s system:\n\nCobalt Strike SMB beacon\nSystemBC\nEmpire\nMimikatz\n\nTo avoid triggering network data transfer, Play splits victim data into chunks before\nexfiltration. To compress the files in .RAR format, they use WinRaR.\n\n## what organization's can do\n\nhere are some best practices that can help protect organizations and end users from\nransomware operators such as Play, those best practices include:\n\nIf running Exchange servers, ensure they are fully patched and running on Windows\nServer 2019. Or move to M365 and a fully hosted environment.\nBlock or restrict the use of psexec within your environment.\nMinimize the use of administrator accounts (at both the local and domain level). All\ndomain administrators should have standard accounts for day-to-day use and\nadditional administrator accounts that are only used when required.\nUse Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software to detect and block aggregation and\nexfiltration of sensitive data.\nWhere possible disable the use of Remote Desktop Protocol via GPO and do not allow\nusers to install other remote access software.\nBack up all data and test those backups regularly. Even if you become the victim of a\nransomware attack, your business operations won’t be severely interrupted, and your\ndata will be retrievable.\nInstall updates regularly – maintain patch management protocols and keep your\noperating systems and applications up to date. This action will deter threat actors from\nexploiting software vulnerabilities.\nUsing phishing resistant MFA on all accounts, especially VPNs, webmail, and accounts\nwith access to critical systems will prevent attackers from performing lateral movement\ninside a network.\n\n\n-----\n\nDeploy and monitor Endpoint Detection and Response or antivirus software and ensure\nthat your analysts are trained to determine at what point of the cyber attack the\ndetection relates to.\n\nRemember, relying on outdated tools and point solutions will only compromise your network\nor system. Organizations should rely on modern technology to detect complex attacks.\n\n## How Avertium is Protecting Our CUSTOMERS\n\nBecause the cyber landscape is always changing, it is imperative to be aware of new cyber\nattack strategies and techniques. Avertium is here to keep you informed and to keep your\norganization safe. We recommend the following services for the best protection against\n**ransomware attacks:**\n\nAvertium offers [VMaaS to provide a deeper understanding and control over](https://www.avertium.com/attack-surface-management-asm#ztna)\norganizational information security risks. If your enterprise is facing challenges with the\nscope, resources, or skills required to implement a vulnerability management program\nwith your team, outsourced solutions can help you bridge the gap.\n\n[Fusion MXDR is the first MDR offering that fuses together all aspects of security](https://www.avertium.com/fusion-mxdr)\noperations into a living, breathing, threat-resistant XDR solution. By fusing insights from\nthreat intelligence, security assessments, and vulnerability management into our MDR\napproach, Fusion MXDR offers a more informed, robust, and cost-effective approach to\ncybersecurity – one that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nAvertium offers Zero Trust Architecture, like [AppGate, to stop malware lateral](https://www.avertium.com/resources/webinars/trust-but-verify-isnt-enough-appgate)\nmovement.\n\nIt is also recommended by Avertium and the FBI that your business require multifactor authentication (MFA) to remotely access networks.\n\nImplementing network segmentation and filtering network traffic to stop phishing\nemails from reaching victims is also helpful.\n\nReach out to your Service Delivery Manager or Account Executive if you need\nassistance applying any of the above recommendations.\n\n## avertium's recommendations\n\n**The FBI and CISA urge all organizations to apply the following recommendations to**\n**prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents:**\n\n\n-----\n\nReview the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your\norganization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software\nor hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\n\nImplement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or\nproprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location\n(i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).\n\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and\ndomain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.\n\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or\nunrecognized accounts.\n\nSegment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can\nhelp prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and\naccess to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.\n\nConsider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\n\nDisable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and\nlateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If\nthreat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating\nprivileges and/or moving laterally.\n\n**MITRE Map**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Supporting Documentation**\n\nAcuerdo Reglamentario 1778 A 15 08 2022 Plan de Contigencia Ciberatque PJ | PDF |\nJusticia | Crimen y violencia (scribd.com)\n\n[Argentina's Judiciary of Córdoba hit by PLAY ransomware attack (bleepingcomputer.com)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/argentinas-judiciary-of-c-rdoba-hit-by-play-ransomware-attack/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Play ransomware claims attack on Belgium city of Antwerp (bleepingcomputer.com)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/play-ransomware-claims-attack-on-belgium-city-of-antwerp/)\n\nThey denounce that they hacked the Judicial Power of Córdoba: it affects the website, the\nsystems and the database (clarin.com)\n\n[Play Ransomware Group Using New ProxyNotShell Exploit | Decipher (duo.com)](https://duo.com/decipher/play-ransomware-group-using-new-proxynotshell-exploit)\n\n[How to Prevent Ransomware Attacks: Top 10 Best Practices in 2022 | UpGuard](https://www.upguard.com/blog/best-practices-to-prevent-ransomware-attacks)\n\n[Play ransomware claims attack on German hotel chain H-Hotels (bleepingcomputer.com)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/play-ransomware-claims-attack-on-german-hotel-chain-h-hotels/)\n\n[Play Ransomware’s Attack Playbook Similar al de Hive, Nokoyawa | (ogdi.org)](https://ogdi.org/csirt/alertas/2089)\n\n[An In-Depth Look at Quantum Ransomware (avertium.com)](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/an-in-depth-look-at-quantum-ransomware)\n\nPlay Ransomware Attack Playbook Similar to that of Hive, Nokoyawa - AlienVault - Open\nThreat Exchange\n\n[Play Ransomware Attack Playbook Similar to that of Hive, Nokoyawa (trendmicro.com)](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/i/play-ransomware-s-attack-playbook-unmasks-it-as-another-hive-aff.html)\n\nPlay ransomware attacks use a new exploit to bypass ProxyNotShell mitigations on\nExchange serversSecurity Affairs\n\n[OWASSRF: CrowdStrike Identifies New Method for Bypassing ProxyNotShell Mitigations](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/owassrf-exploit-analysis-and-recommendations/)\n\n## APPENDIX II: Disclaimer\n\n_This document and its contents do not constitute, and are not a substitute for, legal advice._\n_The outcome of a Security Risk Assessment should be utilized to ensure that diligent_\n_measures are taken to lower the risk of potential weaknesses be exploited to compromise_\n_data._\n\n_Although the Services and this report may provide data that Client can use in its compliance_\n_efforts, Client (not Avertium) is ultimately responsible for assessing and meeting Client's own_\n_compliance responsibilities.
