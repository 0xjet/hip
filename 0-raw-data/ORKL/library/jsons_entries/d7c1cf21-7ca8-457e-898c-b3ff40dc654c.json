The first detection made it clear what the team was dealing with:\nrundll32 executing locker_64.dll – Mount Locker ransomware.\n\nMTR moved quickly to stop the attack on unsecured devices and ensure the ransomware\ngroup was banished from the organization’s network. Throughout the incident all evidence –\nfrom the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used, to the files involved, and even the\nransom note left behind – pointed to this being the work of the Mount Locker group.\n\nHowever, something odd happened when the investigators followed the link included in the\nransom note. Upon following the TOR link, MTR investigators were presented with a chat\ndirectly with the “support” team for the ransomware who introduced themselves as the\n“AstroLocker Team” and also the “Astro Locker Team.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing up on this new lead, an MTR expert found the Astro Locker leak site and, while\nthere was no listing there for the impacted organization of this case, other interesting links\nsurfaced.\n\nWhen comparing the Astro Locker leak site to the Mount Locker leak site, investigators noted\nthat all five of the organizations listed on the Astro Locker site were also listed as victims on\nthe Mount Locker site. Digging in further, the size of the data leaks on all five matched and\nshared some of the same links to the leaked data.\n\nLooking at the matching links more closely, Sophos experts noticed one last connection:\nsome of the leaked data linked on the Mount Locker site was being hosted on the Astro\nLocker onion site: http[:]//anewset****.onion\n\nWhile it is unclear what the relationship is between Mount Locker and Astro Locker,\ndefenders should consider both when dealing with a ransomware attack.\n\n“In recent incidents where Sophos experts investigated and neutralized an active Mount\nLocker attack, we noticed various techniques that suggest these attackers are not as\n[sophisticated as other ransomware groups like Ryuk, REvil and DoppelPaymer,” Peter](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/)\n[Mackenzie, manager of Sophos’ Rapid Response team said. “It is possible that the Mount](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/managed-threat-response/rapid-response.aspx)\nLocker group wants to rebrand themselves to create a new and more professional image, or\n\n\n-----\n\nit could be an attempt to kickstart a true ransomware-as-a-service program. Regardless, if\nany organizations become a victim of ‘Astro Locker’ in the future, they should investigate the\nTTPs of both Mount Locker and Astro Locker.”\n\n## Ransomware relationships and branding\n\nIt is known that [Ragnar Locker is affiliated with Mount Locker in some way but doesn’t](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/09/17/maze-attackers-adopt-ragnar-locker-virtual-machine-technique/)\nappear to be part of the Mount Locker ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). Although Ragnar is\nthe more skilled ransomware group and the two groups don’t overlap in TTPs or malware,\nMackenzie said it was possible there were “back end” services being shared, including\naccess to target networks.\n\nThe connection between Mount Locker and Astro Locker is clearer insofar as they both use\nMount Locker ransomware, the same ransom note, and share some TTPs, such as using\nservices to execute commands and batch scripts. Creating scheduled tasks called ‘updater’\nand ‘regsvr32’ as well as hiding some of their files in the same location: C:\\Users\\\\Music\\.\n\nAstro Locker:\n\nService Name: PrpOJqmErkoJtAAg – random 16-character string\n\nService File Name: %COMSPEC% /C echo whoami ^>\n%SYSTEMDRIVE%\\\\WINDOWS\\\\Temp\\\\FaUocMGJjmCAbJMr.txt >\n\\\\WINDOWS\\\\Temp\\\\uxvbnnSkrkOMnsJg.bat & %COMSPEC% /C start %COMSPEC% /C\n\nScheduled Task Name: updater\n\nAction: regsvr32.exe /i C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Drive\\wininit64.dll\n\nMount Locker:\n\nService Name: xGGXJTFBQlzNTVTT\n\nService File Name: %COMSPEC% /C echo whoami ^>\nZSYSTEMDRIVE%\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\pkLneFsUyHywlUwZ.txt >\n\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\sloKuaTCIYlTTPwM.bat & %COMSPEC% /C start %COMSPEC% /C\n\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\sloKuaTCIYlTTPwM.bat\n\nScheduled Task Name: updater\n\nAction: C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\FileTypePolicies\\archs64.dll\n\n“A few outside sources that have noticed the connection between Mount Locker and Astro\nLocker and suggested it may be a close affiliate relationship. Mount Locker has been\nreported to be running RaaS, but it has never been clear how many affiliates were in the\nprogram,” said Mackenzie. “Astro Locker, as a significant branded group to be part of a\nMount Locker RaaS, could imply Mount Locker is attempting to speed up a transition to\nbecoming a RaaS, or it could even be that the Mount Locker group is using the Astro name\nto pretend they have a big new affiliate.\n\n\n-----\n\n“Branding is a powerful force for ransomware groups,” Mackenzie added. “Good branding\ncan come from a single threat group being skilled at hitting high value targets and avoiding\ndetection – such as DoppelPaymer – or by running a successful RaaS network – like\n[Sodinokibi or Egregor. Powerful branding with ransomware groups can strike fear in targets](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/12/08/egregor-ransomware-mazes-heir-apparent/)\nand lead to a higher likelihood of payouts.\n\n“Mount Locker has proven itself as a less sophisticated ransomware group, so a pivot to an\naffiliate program might be a way to create a new brand and move up the hierarchy of threat\ngroups.”\n\nIOCs\n\n[Mount Locker/Astro Locker ransomware, on its own, is unable to bypass the CryptoGuard](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/Ransomware-MountLocker.csv)\nfeature of [Sophos Intercept X; Our endpoint products may detect components under one or](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/endpoint-antivirus.aspx)\n\n\n-----\n\nmore of the following definitions: Troj/Ransom-GFR and Malware/Generic-S. Network\n[protection products like the Sophos XG firewall can also block the malicious C2 addresses to](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/next-gen-firewall.aspx)\nprevent the malware from retrieving its payloads and completing the infection process.\n\n[IoCs relating to these threats can be found on the SophosLabs Github.](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/)\n\n_Special thanks to John Carlo Adriano, Colin Cowie, Blake Bowdoin, Jordon Carpenter, and_\n_Peter Mackenzie for their efforts in detecting, investigating, and responding to these threats._\n\n\n-----",
