The](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bazarbackdoor-trickbot-gang-s-new-stealthy-network-hacking-malware/)\nconclusion is drawn due to similarities in code, crypters, and infrastructure between the two malware variants.\n\nThe social engineering attacks that were used to spread the backdoor leverage topics such as customer complaints,\n[Covid-19-themed payroll reports, and employee termination lists for the emails they send out. The messages have links](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk-en/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/coronavirus-used-in-spam-malware-file-names-and-malicious-domains)\nto Google Docs files. Once the users click the links, they will be redirected to a landing page. The pages state that the\nWord Document, Excel Spreadsheet, or PDF cannot be properly viewed. It then instructs the user to click on a link to\nopen the file.\n\nClicking on the link downloads an executable that masquerades through icons and names associated with the mentioned\nfile types. For instance, the supposed customer complaint document will be downloaded as Preview.PDF.exe, which\nuses the PDF icon. Since the file extension is hidden by default, the file will convincingly appear as a PDF file.\n\nThe disguised executable serves as the loader for the backdoor. After launching the file, the loader sleeps for some time,\nthen connects to command and control (C&C) servers to check-in and download the payload. The payload will then be\n[injected filelessly into C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe through process hollowing and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/almost-hollow-and-innocent-monero-miner-remains-undetected-via-process-hollowing/) [process doppelgänging](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk-en/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/synack-ransomware-leverages-process-doppelg-nging-for-evasion-and-infection)\ntechniques. The backdoor will be installed on the computer.\n\nThis sets a scheduled task that launches the loader every time the user logs into Windows, which makes way for new\n[versions of the backdoor to be downloaded and injected into svchost.exe. Security researchers Vitali Kremez and James](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nrevealed that this malware was most likely created by the threat actors behind TrickBot trojan. This is because both\nmalware types use the same crypter and email chain deliverables. Both malware also utilize the Emercoin DNS\nresolution service for C&C server communication.\n\n## Defense against fileless threats\n\nFileless threats are stealthy and difficult to detect because they take advantage of existing applications to infiltrate and\nattack systems. However, users can still defend against these malware types by adhering to the following best practices:\n\n[[Related: Risks Under the Radar: Understanding Fileless Threats]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk-en/security/news/security-technology/risks-under-the-radar-understanding-fileless-threats)\n\n[Secure possible entry points. Malicious sites, spam, and third-party components like browser plug-ins can all be](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/hk-en/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-email-threats)\nsources of fileless malware. Be cautious when downloading attachments and other files, and never click links from\nunfamiliar sources.\n\n\n-----\n\nReboot device and change passwords. In case of infection, users can stop fileless attacks that do not employ\npersistence techniques by restarting the device. As an extra precaution, users should also change their passwords.\nUtilize behavior monitoring and analysis. These can detect and block malicious behaviors and routines associated\nwith malware, stopping threats before they can reach the system.\n\nTo further secure the system, the following security solutions are recommended:\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA-256** **Detection Name**\n\n11b5adaefd04ffdaceb9539f95647b1f51aec2117d71ece061f15a2621f1ece9 Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFI\n\n\n1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83\n\n\nTrojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFJ\n\n\n37d713860d529cbe4eab958419ffd7ebb3dc53bb6909f8bd360adaa84700faf2 Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFL\n\n4e4f9a467dd041e6a76e2ea5d57b28fe5a3267b251055bf2172d9ce38bea6b1f Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFK\n\n55d95d9486d77df6ac79bb25eb8b8778940bac27021249f779198e05a2e1edae TrojanSpy.Win64.LOKI.A\n\n5a888d05804d06190f7fc408bede9da0423678c8f6eca37ecce83791de4df83d Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFL\n\n5dbe967bb62ffd60d5410709cb4e102ce8d72299cea16f9e8f80fcf2a1ff8536 TrojanSpy.Win32.TRICKBOT.THAOFBO\n\n6cbf7795618fb5472c5277000d1c1de92b77724d77873b88af3819e431251f00 Trojan.Win32.TRICKBOT.TIGOCBAINS\n\n835edf1ec33ff1436d354aa52e2e180e3e8f7500e9d261d1ff26aa6daddffc55 TrojanSpy.Win64.LOKI.A\n\n859fa9acf0b8a989a1634a1eee309355438b9f6b6f73b69f12d53ac534618c6a Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFK\n\na76426e269a2defabcf7aef9486ff521c6110b64952267cfe3b77039d1414a41 Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFJ\n\nc55f8979995df82555d66f6b197b0fbcb8fe30b431ff9760deae6927a584b9e3 Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFL\n\nce478fdbd03573076394ac0275f0f7027f44a62a306e378fe52beb0658d0b273 Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFM\n\ne90ccb9d51a930f69b78aa0d2612c4af2741311088b9eb7731857579feef89c3 Trojan.Win64.TRICKBOT.CFL\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
