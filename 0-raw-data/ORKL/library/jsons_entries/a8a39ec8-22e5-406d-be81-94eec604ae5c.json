It can steal cookies, extract\nlogins/passwords from applications like Firefox and Microsoft Outlook, record the victim’s keystrokes, allow criminals to remotely view/interact\nwith the victim’s desktop, and can even add the victim’s computer to a botnet. It is most often spread via infected email attachments, via online\nadverts which contain the bot, and via other social engineering methods.\n\nThe original PsixBot malware surfaced in November 2017 but underwent significant development before arriving in beta format in 2019. It has\nsince been developed further and currently stands at version 1.1.0.4 in February 2020:\n\nPsixBot was generated in .NET framework. This blog takes you through the various iterations of PsixBot to illustrate how online criminals\n[constantly update their malware to improve its performance and features.](https://freethreatanalysis.comodo.com/?track=16053&af=16053)\n\n## Behaviour of PsixBot\n\nPsixBot changes the system certificate settings, which gives it virtually unlimited user access rights on the host machine:\n\n**Keys added:**\n\nKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\TrustedPeople\\Certificates\\636D2838EB7A7F3A8E6B6F7CD035375E7E7042\n\n**Values added:**\n\n\n-----\n\n_ OC _ C \\SO \\ c oso t\\Syste Ce t cates\\ usted eop e\\Ce t cates\\636 838 3 8 6 6 C 0353 5 0\n02 00 00 ……..\n\n**Files added:**\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\\n\nMicrosoft\\SystemCertificates\\My\\Certificates\\636D2838EB7A7F3A8E6B6F7CD035375E7E704248\n\n### Beta 1.0.0\n\nThe first version of PsixBot covered in this blog is Beta 1.0.0 with the core class 11.
