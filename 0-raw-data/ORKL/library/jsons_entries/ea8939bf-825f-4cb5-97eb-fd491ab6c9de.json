Many of these technologies have\nboth civilian and military applications.”\n\nThe Netherlands presented no evidence of unlawful acts by the Russian diplomats, Russia’s\nembassy in The Hague said, according to the Interfax news agency.\n\nRussia will give “an adequate and timely” response to the expulsion of the Russian\ndiplomats, Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of the Russian parliament’s foreign affairs\ncommittee, was quoted as saying by Interfax.\n\nIn April 2018, the Netherlands disrupted an attempt by Russian intelligence agents to hack\nthe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague.\n\nFour Russians who were caught with spying equipment at a hotel located next to the OPCW\nheadquarters, were expelled.\n\nThe second spying incident in as many years has prompted the Dutch government to review\nways to make foreign spying punishable, the AIVD said.\n\nReporting by Anthony Deutsch and Toby Sterling in Amsterdam; Additional reporting by\nAndrey Ostroukh in Moscow; Editing by Gareth Jones and Steve Orlofsky\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
