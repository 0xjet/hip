Copyright 2019**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### FORWARD\n\nRarely in the infosec industry do cyber investigators get the luxury of knowing the full scope of their\nadversary’s campaign—from tasking, to actual operations, all the way to completion. The oft-repeated\nmantra “Attribution is hard” largely stands true. Short of kicking down the door just as a cyber actor\npushes enter, it is frustratingly hard to prove who is responsible for cyber attacks with 100% certainty.\nHowever, a series of recent U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) indictments released over the course of\ntwo years, combined with CrowdStrike Intelligence’s own research, has allowed for startling visibility\ninto a facet of China’s shadowy intelligence apparatus.\n\nIn this blog, we take a look at how Beijing used a mixture of cyber actors sourced from China’s\nunderground hacking scene, Ministry of State Security (MSS/国安部) officers, company insiders, and state\ndirectives to fill key technology and intelligence gaps in a bid to bolster dual-use turbine engines which\ncould be used for both energy generation and to enable its narrow-body twinjet airliner, the C919, to\ncompete against western aerospace firms. What follows is a remarkable tale of traditional espionage,\ncyber intrusions, and cover-ups, all of which overlap with activity CrowdStrike Intelligence has previously\nattributed to the China-based adversary TURBINE PANDA. These operations are ultimately traceable\nback to the MSS Jiangsu Bureau, the likely perpetrators of the infamous 2015 U.S. Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) breach.\n\n###### Figure 1. Leap Engine\nSource: https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/cfm-delivers-first-leap-1c-to-comac-414924/\n\n1\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PART I: THE TARGET\n\nThe story starts with a simple fact: Beijing accurately predicted that due to its rising economic status,\nChina’s middle class demand for air travel would far outpace its ability to supply aircraft and a domestic\ncommercial aviation industry capable of supporting these logistics. Putting aside the obvious militarycivil (军民融合) benefits[1] that turbine engines have for the energy and aviation sectors, much of China’s\nstrategic push into this industry is predicated by necessity. China is predicted[2] to succeed the U.S. as the\nworld’s largest aviation market by 2022, adding nearly 1 billion passengers by 2036. From China’s 12th\nand 13th Five Year Plan to the increasingly scrutinized Made in China 2025 Plan,[3] numerous state\nstrategic plans have named aerospace and aviation equipment as one of ten priority industries to focus\non “leap-frog” developments.\n\n\n###### Figure 2. China’s Exponential Growth in Air Travel Mirrored by Rise of China’s\n\n\n###### Middle Class\n\n\nSource: CSIS China Power Project\n\nA major focus of this strategy centered on building an indigenous Chinese-built commercial aircraft\ndesigned to compete with the duopoly of western aerospace. That aircraft would become the C919—an\naircraft roughly half the cost of its competitors, and which completed its first maiden flight[4] in 2017 after\nyears of delays due to design flaws. But the C919 can hardly be seen as a complete domestic triumph as\n\n1 https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR200/RR245/RAND_RR245.pdf\n2 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/08/these-five-charts-show-how-rapidly-china-s-aviation-industry-is-expanding/\n3 https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/final_made_in_china_2025_report_full.pdf\n4 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/05/chinas-first-home-made-plane-makes-maiden-flight\n\n2\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nit is reliant on a plethora of foreign-manufactured components (see Figure 3).[5] Likely in an effort to\nbridge those gaps, a Chinese state-aligned adversary CrowdStrike calls TURBINE PANDA conducted cyber\nintrusions from a period of roughly 2010 to 2015 against several of the companies that make the C919’s\nvarious components.\n\n###### Figure 3. Components of C919\nSource: https://www.aerotime.aero/aerotime.team/447-made-in-china-why-c919-can-hardly-be-called\nchinese\n\nSpecifically, in December 2009, the state-owned enterprise (SOE) Commercial Aircraft Corporation of\nChina (COMAC/中国商用飞机有限责任公司) announced it had chosen CFM International’s (a joint venture\nbetween U.S.-based GE Aviation and French aerospace firm Safran, formerly Snecma) LEAP-X engine to\nprovide a custom variant engine, the LEAP-1C, for the then-newly announced C919. The deal was\nreportedly signed in Beijing during a visit by then-French Prime Minister François Fillon.[6] Despite the\nearly deal with CFM, both COMAC and fellow SOE the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC/中国\n\n航空工业集团公司) were believed[7] to be tasked by China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and\nAdministration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) with building an “indigenously created”\nturbofan engine that was comparable to the LEAP-X.[8]\n\nIn August 2016, both COMAC and AVIC became the main shareholders of the Aero Engine Corporation\nof China (AECC/中国航空发动机集团), which produced the CJ-1000AX engine. The CJ-1000AX bears\n\n5 https://www.aerotime.aero/aerotime.team/447-made-in-china-why-c919-can-hardly-be-called-chinese\n6 https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/cfm-international-to-provide-engines-for-comacs-c919-336414/\n7 http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/04/c_136257538.htm\n8 http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146397/c4244228/content.html\n\n3\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nmultiple similarities to the LEAP-1C,[9] including its dimensions[10] and turbofan blades. The AECC\nconducted its first test as recently as May 2018, having overcome significant difficulties in their first\nmockups. Though it is difficult to assess that the CJ-1000AX is a direct copy of the LEAP-X without direct\naccess to technical engineering specifications, it is highly likely that its makers benefited significantly\nfrom the cyber espionage efforts of the MSS, detailed further in subsequent blog installments, knocking\nseveral years (and potentially billions of dollars) off of its development time.\n\nThe actual process by which the CCP and its SOEs provide China’s intelligence services with key\ntechnology gaps for collection is relatively opaque, but what is known from CrowdStrike Intelligence\nreporting and corroborating U.S. government reporting[11] is that Beijing uses a multi-faceted system of\nforced technology transfer, joint ventures, physical theft of intellectual property from insiders, and\ncyber-enabled espionage to acquire the information it needs. Specifically, SOEs are believed to help\nidentify major intelligence gaps in key projects of significance that China’s intelligence services then are\nlikely tasked with collecting. It is assessed with high confidence that the MSS was ultimately tasked with\ntargeting firms that had technologies pertaining to the LEAP-X engine and other components of the\nC919, based on timing and the details revealed in the DoJ indictments. For example, the first\npreparatory activity in January 2010 believed to be associated with TURBINE PANDA targeted Los\nAngeles-based Capstone Turbine and began just a month after choosing CFM as its engine provider.\n\nThis brings us to our culprits: the Jiangsu Bureau of the MSS (JSSD/江苏省国家安全厅) located in Nanjing.\nIn Part II, we will discuss the JSSD’s location, and its joint operations between the JSSD’s cyber operators\nand its human intelligence officers.\n\n#### PART II: THE CULPRITS\n\nFrom August 2017 until October 2018, the DoJ released several separate, but related indictments\nagainst Sakula developer YU Pingan[12], JSSD Intelligence Officer XU Yanjun[13], GE Employee and insider\nZHENG Xiaoqing[14], U.S. Army Reservist and assessor JI Chaoqun[15], and 10 JSSD-affiliated cyber operators\nin the ZHANG et. al. indictment[16]. What makes these DoJ cases so fascinating is that, when looked at as a\nwhole, they illustrate the broad, but coordinated efforts the JSSD took to collect information from its\naerospace targets. In particular, the operations connected to activity CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked as\nTURBINE PANDA showed both traditional human-intelligence (HUMINT) operators and its cyber\noperators working in parallel to pilfer the secrets of several international aerospace firms.\n\n9 https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/china-completes-assembly-of-first-high-bypass-turbof-444526/\n10 https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/c919s-local-engine-alternative-powered-up-448721/\n11 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FINAL-China-Technology-Report-6.18.18-PDF.pdf\n12 https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/24/yu.pdf\n13 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1099881/download\n14 https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-york-man-charged-theft-trade-secrets\n15 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1096411/download\n16 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1106491/download\n\n4\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 4. JSSD’s Cyber Operations\n\n\n5\n\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, it is believed that cyber targeting of aerospace firms by TURBINE\nPANDA cyber operators began in January 2010, almost immediately after the LEAP-X engine was chosen\nfor the C919. The ZHANG indictment describes initial preparatory action that included compromising Los\nAngeles-based Capstone Turbine servers and later using a doppelganger site as a strategic web\ncompromise (SWC) in combination with DNS hijacking (including a specific technique the indictment\npoints out may have been borrowed from the Syrian Electronic Army/DEADEYE JACKAL[17]) to\ncompromise other aerospace firms. From a period of 2010 to 2015, the linked JSSD operators are\nbelieved to have targeted a variety of aerospace-related targets—including Honeywell, Safran, and\nseveral other firms[18, 19]—using two China-based APT favorites, PlugX and Winnti, and malware assessed\nto be unique to the group dubbed Sakula.\n\nThe same ZHANG indictment indicates that these operations were overseen by CHAI Meng (柴萌), who\nlikely managed the JSSD’s cyber operators as a pseudo Cyber Section Chief. Reporting to CHAI was the\ncyber operator team lead, LIU Chunliang (刘春亮/sxpdlc1r/Fangshou), who appeared to establish and\nmaintain much of the infrastructure used in the attacks on various aerospace targets as well as organize\nthe intrusions conducted by the operators ZHANG Zhanggui (张长贵/Ieanovr/Ieaonr), GAO Hongkun (高洪\n\n坤/Mer4en7y), ZHUANG Xiaowei (庄枭伟/jpxxav), MA Zhiqi (马志琪/Le Ma), and LI Xiao (李潇/zhuan86).\nMany of these individuals are assessed to have storied histories in legacy underground hacking circles\nwithin China dating back to at least 2004.\n\nNotably, LIU also appeared to broker the use of Sakula from its developer YU, as well as the malware\n_IsSpace (associated with SAMURAI PANDA) from its likely developer ZHUANG.[20] LIU and YU’s_\nconversations about Sakula would be a critical factor in tying all of this disparate activity together as\n_Sakula was believed to be unique to the JSSD operators and could be used to tie several aerospace_\nintrusion operations into a single, long-running campaign.\n\n###### JSSD’s HUMINT Efforts\n\nSimultaneously, there was a HUMINT element to the JSSD’s espionage operations against aerospace\ntargets. XU Yanjun, was identified in his indictment[21] as the Deputy Division Director of the Sixth Bureau\nof the JSSD in charge of Insider Threats. XU affiliated himself with two cover organizations—Jiangsu\nScience and Technology Association (JAST) and the Nanjing Science & Technology Association (NAST)—\nwhen interacting with potential targets. XU also was reported as frequently associating with the Nanjing\nUniversity of Aeronautics and Astronomics (NUAA), a significant national defense university controlled\nby China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), that interfaces directly with many of\nChina’s top defense firms and state-owned enterprises. It is likely no coincidence that NUAA is a regular\ncollaborator with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) COMAC and AVIC, the main shareholders of AECC,\nwhich went on to produce the LEAP-X inspired CJ1000-AX turbine engine for the C919.\n\n17 https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/28/syrian-hack-of-nytimes-com-and-twitter-could-have-inflictedmuch-more-than-mere-embarrassment/#3b3746944944\n18 https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-black-vinecyberespionage-group.pdf\n19 https://cyberthreatintelligenceblog.wordpress.com/2018/11/16/c0ld-case-from-aerospace-to-chinas-interests/\n20 https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/24/yu.pdf\n21 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1099881/download\n\n6\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nOver the course of several years, XU would recruit both an insider at LEAP-X manufacturer General\nElectric (GE), ZHENG Xiaoqing, and a Chinese-born Army reservist, JI Chaoqun (季超群). ZHENG’s\nbackground appears to have made him uniquely qualified to accurately assess turbine engine\nschematics, and it was clear from his indictment that he had received coaching on which sensitive\ninformation on GE’s turbine technology to access and how to use steganography in an attempt to\nexfiltrate the information. JI, who entered the U.S. on an F-1 student visa to study electrical engineering\nin Chicago, was approached by XU (initially undercover as an NUAA professor) in December 2013 and\neventually recruited to provide assessments on other high-value individuals in the aerospace industry\nfor potential recruitment by the MSS. JI’s position in the U.S. Army Reserve program known as Military\nAccessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) provided a perfect cover for JI’s assessment activities,\nas the program focuses on potential recruitment of foreign citizens with skills pertinent to national\ninterest and legally residing in the U.S. Had it been successful, JI would have been handing XU other\nforeign-born recruitment candidates as they were about to enter U.S. military service on potentially\nsensitive projects.\n\n###### HUMINT-Enabled Cyber Operations and the Role of CrowdStrike’s Own Blog\n\nIn February 2014, one of our own blogs described the relationship between cyber activity in 2012\nagainst Capstone Turbine and an SWC targeting Safran/Snecma carried out by TURBINE PANDA,\npotentially exposing the HUMINT-enabled cyber operations described in some of the indictments. As\ndescribed in the ZHANG indictment, on 26 February 2014, one day after the release of our “French\nConnection” blog publicly exposed some of TURBINE PANDA’s operations, intel officer XU texted his\nJSSD counterpart, cyber director CHAI, asking if the domain ns24.dnsdojo.com was related to their cyber\noperations. That domain was one of the few controlled by cyber operator lead LIU, and several hours\nafter CHAI responded to XU’s text that he would verify, the domain name was deleted.\n\nAccording to the ZHANG indictment, The deletion was believed to be carried out by GU Gen (顾根),\nSafran’s Suzhou Branch IT manager, when Safran began investigating beaconing from that domain\nfollowing the blog post and notification from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). GU had been\n\n7\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\npreviously recruited around January 2014 by XU, and was able to act as a fixer for LIU and his team’s\noperations. The indictment also showed that XU had also previously recruited another Safran Suzhou\ninsider named TIAN Xi (田曦) in November 2013, giving him a USB drive with Sakula on it. On 25 January\n2014, TIAN communicated to XU that he had installed Sakula on Safran’s networks, and XU in turn\ntexted confirmation to CHAI, who’s team subsequently began their operations on Safran’s networks\nover the next month.\n\n###### Where is the JSSD?\n\nThough not much is publicly known about the internal organizational structure of China’s secretive\nnational intelligence service, the MSS is known to operate a number of large municipal bureaus,\nnormally located in the provincial capitals. Through a mixture of open-source research and confirmation\nfrom sensitive source reporting, CrowdStrike Intelligence confirmed two locations that the JSSD likely\noperates out of:\n\n1.

Approximately 31°58'45.65\"N, 118°46'32.93\"E in the Yuhua District of Nanjing - 江苏省南京市雨花台区\n\n软件大道 33 号\n\n###### Figure 7. Architectural Mockup of JSSD Compound\n\nA particular Nanjing architectural firm appears fairly proud of the job it did on this JSSD compound (see\nabove), and prominently features pictures of architectural mockups of the building’s outside, atrium,\nand even its gym as splash pages on its main site.[24] Again, the JSSD hanzi (江苏省国家安全厅) are directly\non the site along with indications that it was built in 2009. A comparison with the street view[25] (see\nFigure 8) and corroboration with sensitive source reporting gives us fairly high confidence that this\nbuilding and location is affiliated with the JSSD. A satellite view shows an array of satellite dishes out\nfront as well.\n\n23\n\nhttps://jiangsu.youbianku.com/%E5%90%8D%E5%BD%95/%E6%B1%9F%E8%8B%8F%E7%9C%81%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5\n%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E5%8E%85%E5%B9%BC%E5%84%BF%E5%9B%AD\n24 https://web.archive.org/save/http:/dadda.cn/show-19-79-1.html\n25\n\nhttps://maps.baidu[.]cn/#panoid=09002500121709131120474746L&panotype=street&heading=353.22&pitch=3.8&l=21&tn=B\n_NORMAL_MAP&sc=0&newmap=1&shareurl=1&pid=09002500121709131120474746\n\n9\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mockup\n\nIn the next section, we’ll discuss the aftermath of these operations, their connection to other Chinese\ncyber campaigns, and how they fit into China’s larger strategy of “leapfrog” development.\n\n#### PART III: THE AFTERMATH\n\nThe arrests of MSS officer XU Yanjun, his insiders (ZHENG Xiaoqing and JI Chaoqun), and Sakula\ndeveloper YU Pingan will ultimately not deter Beijing from mounting other significant cyber campaigns\ndesigned to achieve leapfrog development in areas they perceive to be of strategic importance. Though\nXU’s arrest in particular was likely a massive boon to U.S. intelligence given he was the first MSS officer\n(not simply an asset) known to be arrested, China has not ceased cyber operations even after incidents\ntying GOTHIC PANDA[26] and STONE PANDA[27] to the MSS were exposed publicly.\n\nThe reality is that many of the other cyber operators that made up TURBINE PANDA operations will\nlikely never see a jail cell. YU was arrested in 2017 following his attendance at a U.S.-based security\nconference, and CrowdStrike Intelligence sensitive source reporting indicated that following his arrest,\nthe MSS issued strict orders for China’s security researchers to be barred from participating in overseas\nconferences or Capture the Flag competitions, likely fearing a repeat occurrence and more arrests of its\noffensive talents.\n\nIn years prior to that directive, Chinese teams—such as those from Qihoo 360, Tencent, and Baidu—had\ndominated overseas competitions and bug bounties including Pwn2Own and CanSecWest, earning\nthousands of dollars in cash rewards for their zero-day exploits for popular systems such as Android, iOS,\nTesla, Microsoft, and Adobe. Instead, the companies these researchers work for were required to\nprovide vulnerability information to the China Information Technical Security Evaluation Center\n\n26 https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2017/05/09/apt3-is-boyusec-a-chinese-intelligence-contractor/\n27 https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/two-birds-one-stone-panda/\n\n10\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n(CNITSEC/中国信息安全测评中心). CNITSEC was previously identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence and other\nindustry reporting[28] as being affiliated with the MSS Technical Bureau and it runs the Chinese National\nInformation Security Vulnerability Database (CNNVD/中国国家信息安全漏洞库), which was outed for its\nrole in providing the MSS with cutting-edge vulnerabilities likely for use in offensive operations.[29]\n\nHowever, even before this directive, it is likely that many of the vulnerabilities used in offensive MSS\noperations came from these researchers. Many of the senior security researchers and executives at\nChinese security firms got their start in legacy domestic hacking groups such as Xfocus and went on to\nturn their talents into successful careers—some whitehat, some blackhat, and the large majority\nprobably falling somewhere in the grey area. The majority of these firms are listed partners of the\nCNNVD (see the image below). NSFOCUS, for example, was formed out of the remnants of the\ncommercialized faction of China’s patriotic hacking group the Green Army; its hanzi characters are\nactually still the same as the original group’s name. Venustech and Topsec were both listed as known\nChinese state-affiliated contractors in leaked U.S. government cable. Topsec was also linked to\ncampaigns against the aerospace sector and Anthem breaches in public reporting.[30]\n\n###### Figure 9. Prominent Chinese Tech Firms Partnering with the MSS-Affiliated\n CNNVD\n\nWhat is notable about the use of certain vulnerabilities and strains of malware sourced from the Chinese\nunderground is that they often uniquely indicate which actors are responsible for which campaigns. In\nthis case, Sakula is described in the YU indictment as being relatively unique and was provided to JSSD\n\n28 https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-behind-apt3/\n29 https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-vulnerability-influence/\n30 https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-black-vinecyberespionage-group.pdf\n\n11\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nlead operator LIU Chunliang by YU along with multiple other vulnerabilities that were used against\naerospace firms by LIU and other cyber operators that comprised TURBINE PANDA operations. The\nusage of Sakula across multiple victims and the arrest of its developer, YU, by the FBI would prove\ncritical for several reasons.\n\nIndustry reporting[31] outlined the overlapping similarities between activity at one of TURBINE PANDA’s\nvictims that exhibited certain tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and the usage of Sakula in the\nAnthem breach publicly disclosed in 2015. As indicated by an FBI Flash Report[32] detailing the tools used\nin the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intrusion, Sakula was named along with FFRAT and\nthe IsSpace malware (tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as being used by SAMURAI PANDA and also\nconnected to JSSD operators in the ZHANG indictment via cyber operator ZHUANG Xiaowei) in the OPM\ncase, likely indicating the JSSD was also behind these operations.\n\nPublic reporting has long theorized that the same operators were behind the Anthem and OPM\nincidents, and that both operations were likely perpetrated by actors affiliated with the MSS. Further\nreporting tied a breach at United Airlines to the same group that perpetrated Anthem and OPM,\nreaffirming that those actors had interests in aviation as well.[33] It is likely that the DoJ indictments\nprovided yet another piece to this complicated puzzle that saw the pilfering of the data of millions of\ncleared U.S. government workers funneled to China, a veritable intelligence gold-mine for recruiting\npotential future spies.\n\n###### The Bigger Picture\n\nEven with the arrest of a senior MSS intelligence officer and a valuable malware developer, the potential\nbenefits of cyber-enabled espionage to China’s key strategic goals has seemingly outweighed the\nconsequences to date. Beijing still has a long way to go before it has a completely independent domestic\ncommercial aviation industry, as evidenced by the $45 billion USD deal to purchase 300 Airbus planes\nduring President XI Jinping’s recent visit to France.[34] XI inked a similar purchase agreement for 300\nBoeing planes during a November 2017 visit to the U.S. Yet China still seeks to decrease its dependency\non this duopoly and eventually compete on an even footing with them. Notably, China was the first\ncountry to ground Boeing’s 737 MAX and tout its own air safety records, following a second deadly 737\nMAX crash this year.[35]\n\nIn May 2017, weeks after the C919’s successful maiden flight in China, AECC and Russia’s United Aircraft\nCorp (UAC) announced a 50-50 joint venture (JV) called China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International\nCorp (CRAIC) to fund and design a new aircraft dubbed CR929 (see Figure 10), a wide-body jet designed\nto compete with the Airbus 350 and Boeing 787.[36] Though both countries will design much of the\n\n31 Ibid.\n32 https://info.publicintelligence.net/FBI-HackToolsOPM.pdf\n33 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-29/china-tied-hackers-that-hit-u-s-said-to-breach-united-airlines\n34 https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3003384/china-france-sign-us45-billion-deals-including-airbusorder?utm_medium=email&utm_source=mailchimp&utm_campaign=enlzscmp_china&utm_content=20190327&MCUID=f85aea33ab&MCCampaignID=ea970c4480&MCAccountID=3775521f5f5420472\n46d9c827&tc=5\n35 https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/business/china-boeing.html\n36 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-comac-russia-idUSKBN18I0KZ\n\n12\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\naircraft, the CR929’s engines, onboard electrical systems, and other components will still likely need to\nbe supplied by foreign suppliers.[37]\n\n\n###### Figure 10. CR929 Airliner\n\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nSimilar to the procedure for developing the C919, the JV is currently taking bids for an aircraft engine\nthat will be used until a Chinese-Russian substitute can take its place; this appears likely to be the CJ2000, an upgraded version of the CJ-1000AX used in the C919. Finalists in the bidding process may face\nadditional targeting from China-based adversaries that have demonstrated the capability and intent to\nengage in such intellectual property theft for economic gain. It is unclear whether Russia, a state that\nalso has experienced cyber operators at its disposal, would also engage in cyber-enabled theft of\nintellectual property related to the CR929.\n\nThe C919 still faces significant barriers to entry—namely, international certification and the current\nSino-U.S. trade war. COMAC aims to have the C919 pass grueling certification standards by the end of\n2020.\n\nNotably, public reporting in February 2019 detailed a potential cover-up involving a November 2016\ncyber intrusion at the Canada-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations\n(UN) body that sets global civil aviation standards.[38] The documents indicate that the intrusion at ICAO\nwas likely designed to facilitate a strategic web compromise (SWC) attack (similar to what TURBINE\n\n37 https://chinapower.csis.org/china-commercial-aviation/\n38 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-based-un-aviation-agency-tried-to-cover-up-2016-cyberattackdocuments-show-1.5033733\n\n13\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nPANDA did with Capstone Turbine and described in Part II of this series) that would easily provide a\nspringboard to target a plethora of other aerospace-related as well as foreign government victims. Upon\nbeing alerted to the breach by the Aviation Information Sharing and Analysis Center (AISAC), the ICAO\ninternal IT investigation staff was reportedly grossly negligent, and the cyber intruders may have had\ndirect access to one of their superuser accounts. In addition, a file containing a list of all the potential\norganizations who were compromised by the incident mysteriously disappeared during further\ninvestigations.\n\n\n###### Figure 11. ICAO’s Secretary General Gang LIU and IT Deputy Director James\n\n\n###### WAN Suspected of Having Mishandled Investigation of Breach\n\n\nSource: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)\n\nOutside, third-party investigations point to China-based EMISSARY PANDA as the culprit. CrowdStrike\nIntelligence is unable to independently confirm this; however, EMISSARY PANDA has been previously\nobserved targeting the aviation industry as well. Both the ICAO IT supervisor in charge of the mishandled\ninternal investigation, James WAN, and Fang LIU, the ICAO’s secretary general who shelved\nrecommendations to investigate WAN and his four team members, were both found by CrowdStrike to\nhave ties to China’s aviation industry. LIU previously was a major figure at the Civil Aviation\nAdministration of China (CAAC), one of several prominent Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\ntasked with advancing China’s aviation industry.[39] WAN was previously connected to the Civil Aviation\nUniversity of China (CUAC), another prominent institution in China’s aviation industry research that is\nadministered by CAAC. Though CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot make any high confidence\ndeterminations about the breach, the timing in 2016, the techniques (such as attempting an upstream\nSWC to target other industry victims), and the nature of the intrusion into ICAO is an eerily similar\nsituation to GU Gen, the MSS-recruited IT manager at Safran’s Suzhou branch who sought to cover up\n\n39 https://www.icao.int/DownloadDocs/liu_biography_en.pdf\n\n14\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nTURBINE PANDA operations (see the previous blog post). LIU, WAN, and the four employees are all still\nemployed at ICAO.\n\nA major facet of the current Sino-U.S. trade war is forced technology transfer, which Beijing has used to\ngreat effect by siphoning intellectual property from foreign firms in exchange for providing joint\nventures (JVs) and granting access to China’s lucrative market, only to be forced out later by domestic\nrivals as they grow competitive with state subsidies and support. Under current laws, the C919’s foreign\nsuppliers (many of whom were targets of TURBINE PANDA operations) are required to physically\nassemble components in China through a JV with COMAC.[40]\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the high-level Sino-U.S. trade negotiations will result in limiting Beijing’s\nability to speed its aviation development through JVs, forced technology transfer, HUMINT operations,\nor cyber-enabled theft of IP. But the unprecedented visibility into how the MSS and its cyber operators\nenhance China’s leapfrog development coming at this time is more than just a coincidence.\n\n40 https://apex.aero/2019/01/23/comac-aims-high\n\n15\n\nCopyright 2019\n\n\n-----",
