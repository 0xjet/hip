The most likely culprit at this time of the known ransomware groups is](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1359167108727332868)\na group known as HelloKitty.\n\nBelow we have taken a look at previous HelloKitty attacks, and found a trail of victims.\nPrevious attacks include potentially dangerous code to kill applications, including Industrial\nControl Systems. We also found links to earlier notable ransomware attacks.\n\n**Background**\n\n[Yesterday CD Projekt Red revealed they had fallen victim to a ransomware attack:](https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660/photo/1)\n\n\n-----\n\n_An unidentified actor gained unauthorized access to our internal network, collected certain_\n_data belonging to CD PROJEKT capital group, and left a ransom note the content of which_\n_we release to the public.”_\n\nThey join a [number of other gaming companies to have recently suffered the same fate.](https://www.wired.com/story/cd-projekt-red-ransomware-hack-cyberpunk-2077-source-code/)\n\nThe ransomware note shared by CD Projekt Red\nThe [Emsisoft CTO has](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/hated_and_hunted_the_computer_virus_malware_ransomware_cracker) [suggested this may be the work of HelloKitty ransomware. That is](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1359167108727332868)\n[based on the ransomware note and rare filename, and they caveat that it’s not possible to be](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/37783/hellokitty-ransomware-group-likely-responsible-for-cd-projekt-attack-heres-why/)\nsure without seeing the ransomware itself. We’d concur with that caution. Whilst the notes\nare certainly familiar (as shown below) – they are custom for most victims and not an exact\nmatch. As an anti-virus with a track record of ransomware analysis, it’s likely Emsisoft has\nseen samples of HelloKitty that we have not and have included that in their assessment.\n\nWith those caveats in hand – we took a look at previous HelloKitty attacks below.\n\n**Most Recent Attacks**\n\nThe most recent attack we’ve seen from HelloKitty targeted a UK Healthcare organisation at\nthe end of January 2021. Below is the ransomware note, with the name of the targeted\norganisation redacted:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt goes without saying that it is particularly irresponsible to be deploying targeted\nransomware to organisations that provide key medical services during a global pandemic.\n\n**Christmas 2020 Attacks**\n\nAttackers are well aware of the importance timing can make to the impact of their attacks.\nNotably, [Russian attackers successfully disabled Ukranian power networks for two](https://www.wired.com/story/crash-override-malware/)\nconsecutive Christmas Eve’s. The timing both left thousands of families without power on\nChristmas day, and only a skeleton crew at the power company to respond.\n\nWe’re aware of at least two, and likely more, attacks that HelloKitty delivered on Christmas\nDay 2020. They likely had access for some time before, but chose to deploy their\nransomware on Christmas day for maximum impact.\n\nThe first has previously been reported on. At Christmas 2020 the Brazilian powerplant\noperator [CEMIG disclosed on Facebook that they had fallen victim to a ransomware attack:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEMIG)\n\n_“CEMIG informs that on December 25, 2020, the SOC (security operation nucleus) detected_\n_anomalous behavior on the internal network, with characteristics of a malicious ransomware_\n_attack. The teams responsible for the correct detection of the attack and subsequent_\n_adoption of the containment measures were immediately activated._\n\n_Less than 10% of servers on the Windows / Microsoft Hyper-V platform had their content_\n_encrypted. Workstations have also been partially compromised and are in the process of_\n_being verified. It is important to highlight that, thanks to the fast and effective containment_\n_action carried out by Cemig, the operation of the electrical system and the main databases_\n_(customers, billing, customer service and business management) were not compromised,_\n_thus guaranteeing the provision of services to our clients.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe statement about the Hyper-V platform matches the ransomware note we ve seen linked\nto the attack:\n\nThe CEMIG Ransomware note\nReportedly, CEMIG had restored their system [within four days.](https://www.cisoadvisor.com.br/cemig-foi-atacada-pelo-kitty-ransomware-servicos-inoperantes/)\n\nAs normal with targeted ransomware, the attackers provided a chat link for CEMIG. The\n[conversation was captured by the site ID Ransomware (RU). Based on the conversation, we](https://id-ransomware.blogspot.com/2020/11/hellokitty-ransomware.html)\nthink it is unlikely that CEMIG* decided to pay the ransom:\n\n\n-----\n\n- Other analysts have [pointed out that given the payment link was made public, this may not](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1359974313668071425)\nbe CEMIG communicating with Hello Kitty.\n\nBut CEMIG was not the only target at Christmas. We’ve seen another HelloKitty ransomware\nnote from a different target that was uploaded to the site VirusTotal.com on Christmas day\n2020:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [ransom note to a French IT service (we have redacted the name)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/02a08b994265901a649f1bcf6772bc06df2eb51eb09906af9fd0f4a8103e9851/community)\n**Application Termination**\n\n[One sample of HelloKitty, compiled on 26th December 2020, contains a large list of](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/fa722d0667418d68c4935e1461010a8f730f02fa1f595ee68bd0768fd5d1f8bb)\napplications to terminate:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were disturbed to see terminated applications included Industrial Control System\n[software such as GE Proficy and](https://www.ge.com/digital/applications/proficy-historian) [Honeywell HMIWeb. Investigating this list, it appears it is](https://www.honeywellprocess.com/en-US/support/_layouts/honeywell/hps/support-product.aspx?column=Releases&PN=HMIWeb%20Solutions)\n[copied from the MegaCortex/Ekans/Snake ransomware.](https://www.wired.com/story/ekans-ransomware-industrial-control-systems/)\n\n[When the MegaCortex list was first identified it generated significant concern about the](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/blog/posts/snakeekans-ransomware-attacks-industrial-control-systems-acronis-stops-it)\nimpact it could have on SCADA systems. However, more day to day applications such as\n[backup software and accounting software are also terminated. As researchers noted at the](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-and-ics-operations/)\ntime – the attackers seem concerned with stopping any software that may limit its impact,\nrather than specifically targeting SCADA.\n\nNonetheless it is concerning to see such careless code in a sample of malware, which was\ncompiled at the same time that a Powerplant operator was enduring their attack.\n\n**Links to Earlier Campaigns**\n\n[We quickly found links to the “TechStrat” ransomware identified in October 2020. The](https://isarc.tachyonlab.com/3429?category=836647)\nransomware note is named the same (“read_me_lkdtt.txt”) as many HelloKitty ransomware\nnotes. And the note itself is very similar to the note that was deployed to CEMIG:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Decompiling the code of a sample, shows it to also be extremely similar to other HelloKitty](https://github.com/cado-security/hellokitty-ransomware)\nsamples. It also contains the code to kill a range of applications that was borrowed from\nMegaCortex.\n\nIn addition, [we (and others 1,](https://twitter.com/chrisdoman/status/1359223448803938310) [2) spotted possible overlaps with an earlier family called](https://twitter.com/tylabs/status/1359210228676370432)\n[“DeathRansom”. A quick review is shown from Intezer’s analysis and Antivirus vendors often](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/fa722d0667418d68c4935e1461010a8f730f02fa1f595ee68bd0768fd5d1f8bb)\ndetecting both HelloKitty ransomware binaries and notes as DeathRansom:\n\nIf so, that may be particularly interesting given that Fortinet tracked down the DeathRansom\n[author in an involved blog post in January 2020.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/death-ransom-attribution)\n\nAdditionally, [Emsisoft caveat here:](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/37783/hellokitty-ransomware-group-likely-responsible-for-cd-projekt-attack-heres-why/)\n\n_“Some analysts may refer to HelloKitty as DeathRansom, a strain of malware that was_\n_originally only capable of renaming files. Different versions of DeathRansom were later_\n_developed that could encrypt files in various ways. However, the relationship between_\n_DeathRansom and HelloKitty is still not fully clear.”_\n\n**In Closing**\n\nIt’s clear that HelloKitty is yet another set of targeted ransomware operators that have moved\nto threaten their victims with impact going beyond the immediate destruction of data. If they\nare indeed linked to the earlier DeathRansom attacks, they have improved significantly from\n[their initial forays into ransomware. The first version didn’t even encrypt anything. We have](https://www.zdnet.com/article/deathransom-evolves-from-joke-to-actual-ransomware/)\nprovided some suggested mitigation strategies below.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have included a number of mitigation strategies that Cado Security recommends both for\nHelloKitty and ransomware in general:\n\nConsider utilising separate IT systems (privileged access workstations) for used by\nnetwork and system administrators. For these systems, utilise additional two-factor\nauthentication and ensure there is no direct access to the Internet.\nConsider employing an “allowed list” to restrict server outbound communications to IP’s\n/ Domains that they need access to.\nConsider storing backups of key business and critical IT infrastructure systems e.g.\nActiveDirectory, off of your network.\nAvoid opening up RDP services to the internet, if it’s required consider using an\nALLOW LIST approach only, and DENY all unknown IPs by default.\nEnsure you have the ability to restore to a segregated network environment.\nEnsure you have tested the restore capabilities of your backups.\n\nBoth the [UK NCSC and](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware-and-ransomware-attacks) [ICS-CERT provide more extended mitigations for destructive](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-15-022-01)\nattacks.\n\n**About Cado Security**\nCado Security specialises in providing tooling and techniques that allow organisations to\nthreat hunt and investigate cloud and container systems.
