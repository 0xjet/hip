Oktober 2022\n\nNetzwerk\n\nWe analyzed a QAKBOT-related case leading to a Brute Ratel C4 and Cobalt Strike payload that can be attributed to the threat actors behind\nthe Black Basta ransomware.\n\nBy: Ian Kenefick, Lucas Silva, Nicole Hernandez\nOctober 12, 2022\nRead time: ( words)\n\n## Summary\n\n[QAKBOT’s malware distribution resumed on September 8, 2022 following a brief hiatus, when our researchers spotted several distribution](https://www.trendmicro.com/de_de/research/21/k/qakbot-loader-returns-with-new-techniques-and-tools.html)\n[mechanisms on this date. The distribution methods observed included SmokeLoader (using the ‘snow0x’ distributor ID), Emotet (using the](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/e/bruised-but-not-broken--the-resurgence-of-the-emotet-botnet-malw.html)\n‘azd‘ distributor id), and malicious spam that used the ‘BB’ and ‘Obama20x’ IDs.\n\nA recent case involving the QAKBOT ‘BB’ distributor led to the deployment of Brute Ratel (detected by Trend Micro as\nBackdoor.Win64.BRUTEL) — a framework similar to Cobalt Strike — as a second-stage payload. This is a noteworthy development because\nit is the first time we have observed Brute Ratel as a second-stage payload via a QAKBOT infection. The attack also involved the use of Cobalt\nStrike itself for lateral movement. We attribute these activities to the threat actors behind the Black Basta ransomware.\n\nIntrusion timeline\n\nFigure 1. The intrusion timeline for the attack\n\n## The rise of Brute Ratel and other C&C frameworks\n\n\n-----\n\nute ate s a co e c a (pa d) d e sa y u at o a e o a d a e at e e co e to t e co e c a C&C a e o space, e e\nit competes with more established players such as Cobalt Strike.\n\nAdversary Emulation frameworks like Brute Ratel and Cobalt Strike are marketed to penetration testing professionals (Red Teams) for use in\nlegitimate penetration testing activities in which organizations seek to improve their ability to detect and respond to real cyberattacks. These\nframeworks are used to provide hands-on keyboard access from remote locations to emulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nused by attackers in network intrusions.\n\nOn top of Cobalt Strike’s legitimate use cases, it has gained notoriety for its illicit usage and near omnipresence in high-profile, humanoperated ransomware attacks during the past few years. It serves as a common second-stage payload from Botnets such as QAKBOT\n(TrojanSpy.Win64.QAKBOT), IcedID (TrojanSpy.Win64.ICEDID), Emotet (TrojanSpy.Win64.EMOTET), and Bumblebee\n(Trojan.Win64.BUMBLELOADER), among others. Unfortunately, several versions of Cobalt Strike have been leaked over the past couple of\nyears, accelerating its malicious use by cybercriminals.\n\nAs a result of its popularity compared to Brute Ratel, its detection coverage is greater than that of the latter. This makes Brute Ratel and other\nless established C&C frameworks an increasingly more attractive option for malicious actors, whose activities may remain undetected for a\nlonger period.\n\nBrute Ratel has recently attracted greater interest from threat actors in the cybercriminal underground, where versions of the framework are\nactively traded and cracked versions circulated. It is unknown how Brute Ratel was initially leaked, but its developers have acknowledged the\nleak on Twitter.\n\nQAKBOT ‘BB’ to Brute Ratel\n\nFigure 2.\n\nA summary of the campaign’s procedure\nThe campaign commences via a SPAM email containing a malicious new URL being sent to potential victims. The URL landing page presents\nthe recipient with a password for a ZIP file.\n\nFigure 3. Notification that the ZIP file has been downloaded, along with the password to the file\n\n## Sandbox and security solution evasion\n\nThe use of password-protected ZIP files at this stage is likely an attempt to evade analysis by security solutions.\n\n## Mark of the Web evasion\n\n\n-----\n\ne e co ta s a s g e SO e e use o a SO e s a atte pt to de eat t e a o t e eb ( O ), c tags es as be g\ndownloaded from the internet. It subjects these files to additional security measures by Windows and endpoint security solutions.\n\nThe ISO file contains a visible LNK file that uses the “Explorer” icon and two hidden subdirectories, each containing various files and\ndirectories. By default, on Windows operating systems, hidden files are not displayed to the user. Figure 5 illustrates what the user sees when\nthe “Show hidden files” setting is enabled.\n\nFigure 4. The addition hidden subdirectories that the user sees when the “Show hidden files” setting is enabled\nThe directory structure is as follows:\n\nFigure 5.

The file names, detection names, and hashes for the indicators used in the initial part of the infection routine\n\n\n-----\n\n## Command line interface Execution sequence\n\nQAKBOT uses obfuscation across two script files, a JavaScript (.js) file and a Batch Script (.cmd) file, likely in an effort to conceal suspiciouslooking command lines.\n\nFigure 6.\n\nThe execution sequence for the command line interface\n\n## Initial QAKBOT C&C server communication\n\nThe C&C Infrastructure is geographically distributed across compromised hosts residing in predominantly residential Internet Service Provider\n(ISP) broadband networks.\n\nThe following countries are where the C&C servers reside:\n\nAfghanistan\nAlgeria\nArgentina\nAustria\nBrazil\n\n\n-----\n\nu ga a\nCanada\nChile\nColombia\nEgypt\nIndia\nIndonesia\nJapan\nMexico\nMongolia\nMorocco\nNetherlands\nQatar\nRussia\nSouth Africa\nTaiwan\nThailand\nTurkey\nUnited Arab Emirates\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\nVietnam\nYemen\n\nThese ‘Tier 1’ C&C Servers are considered disposable by the QAKBOT operators and are replaced frequently (nearly every time there is a\nnew distribution of the malware), though some persist across multiple QAKBOT malware configurations.\n\nAutomated reconnaissance commands\n\nJust six minutes after the initial C&C communication, and with the QAKBOT malware now running inside an injected process (wermgr.exe),\nautomated reconnaissance in the infected environment is performed via the execution of multiple built-in command line tools. The execution of\nthese command lines is in the following order:\n\n**Order** **Process** **Command Line**\n\n**1** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\net.exe net view\n\n**2** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ARP.EXE arp -a\n\n**3** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ipconfig.exe ipconfig /all\n\n**4** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\nslookup.exe nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain_fqdn>\n\n**5** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\net.exe net share\n\n**6** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ROUTE.EXE route print\n\n**7** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\NETSTAT.EXE netstat -nao\n\n**8** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\net.exe net localgroup\n\n**9** C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\whoami.exe whoami /all\n\nTable 2.

The\nfiles are then packed into a ZIP file in preparation for exfiltration. The entire process is scripted and takes less than two seconds to complete.\n\nFigure 10. Outputting JSON files via svchost.exe\n\n## Brute Ratel drops Cobalt Strike\n\nInterestingly, the actors chose to leverage Cobalt Strike for lateral movement. The first of several beacon files are dropped onto the same\ninfected endpoint running Brute Ratel C4, with the first being:\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Name-123456.xls\n\nThis beacon file is executed on the same host running the Brute Ratel C4 using the following command:\n\nrundll32 C:\\users\\public\\Name-123456.xls,DllRegisterServer\n\nThe actor drops the other beacon files and copies these to administrative shares on other hosts on the network, again using filenames bearing\nXLS attachments.\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\abcabc.xls\nC:\\Users\\Public\\abc-1234.xls\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Orders_12_34_56.xls\nC:\\Users\\Public\\MkDir.xls\n\nThe commands used to copy the files are as follows:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C copy C:\\users\\public\\fksro.xls\n\n\\\\<HOST>\\C$\\users\\public\\abcabc.xls\n\nThe following list is the beacon C&C Servers:\n\nhxxps://fewifasoc[.]com | 45.153.242[.]251\nhxxps://hadujaza[.]com | 45.153.241[.]88\nhxxps://himiketiv[.]com | 45.153.241[.]64\n\nThe threat actors were then evicted from the environment before any final actions could be taken. We assess based on the level of access and\ndiscovery activity that the likely final actions would have been a domain-wide ransom deployment.\n\nQAKBOT ‘Obama’ to Brute Ratel\n\n\n-----\n\na ot e, o e ece t, c de t, e d c o esea c spotted Q O us g t e Oba a d st buto p e ( e Oba a 08 ) a so\ndropping Brutel Ratel C4 as a second-stage payload.\n\nIn this case, the malware arrives as a password-protected ZIP file delivered via HTML smuggling, which allows the attacker to “smuggle” an\nencoded malicious script into an HTML attachment or web page. Once the user opens the HTML page in the browser, the script is decoded\nand the payload is assembled.\n\nFigure 11. QAKBOT distributors use password protection to defeat network and sandbox security scans\nOnce the ZIP file is decrypted using the password provided in the HTML attachment, the user is presented with an ISO file. The malicious files\nare contained in the ISO file, which is used as a Mark of the Web bypass. Inside, an ISO file bears the following directory structure:\n\nFigure 12. ISO file directory structure\n\nSince QAKBOT’s return, we have observed multiple varieties in the execution chain, from scripting languages to file extensions and the use of\nexport function names and ordinals. For this infection, the following variation was used:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. The\n\nvariation used for the infection\nThe infection plays out with the same TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) described in the first kill chain in this blog. However, one\nnotable difference was observed in the C&C configuration, which used DNS over HTTPS (DoH) vs a more traditional HTTPS C&C Channel.\nThe C&C servers observed used HTTPS with Let’s-Encrypt.\n\nBy using DoH, attackers can hide DNS queries from C&C domains. If SSL/TLS traffic is not being inspected using man-in-the-middle (MitM)\ntechniques, DNS queries to the C&C server will therefore go unnoticed.\n\nFigure 14. Brute Ratel Process\n\nperforming C&C Communication via DNS over HTTPS (DoH). The threat was contained before any final actions could be taken.\n\n## Links to the Black Basta ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Brute Ratel and Cobalt Strike Infrastructure used in QakBot to Black Basta Intrusions (click the image for a larger version of it)\nBased on our investigations, we can confirm that the QAKBOT-to-Brute Ratel-to-Cobalt Strike kill chain is associated with the group behind the\nBlack Basta Ransomware. This is based on overlapping TTPs and infrastructure observed in Black Basta attacks. It is not the first time that we\n[have observed intrusions via QAKBOT leading to Black Basta.](https://www.trendmicro.com/de_de/research/22/f/black-basta-ransomware-operators-expand-their-attack-arsenal-wit.html)\n\n## Conclusion and security recommendations\n\nUsers can thwart new QAKBOT variants and other threats that spread through emails by following some of these best practices:\nVerify the email sender and content before downloading attachments or selecting embedded links from emails.\nHover the pointer above embedded links to show the link’s target.\nCheck the sender’s identity. Unfamiliar email addresses, mismatched email and sender names, and spoofed company emails are some\nof the signs that the sender has malicious intent.\nIf the email claims to come from a legitimate company, verify if they actually sent it before taking any action.\n\nOrganizations should take note of the trending use of Cobalt Strike in attacks, living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins), and red team or\npenetration-testing tools, i.e. Brutel Ratel C4, to blend in with the environment.\n\nUsers can also protect systems through managed detection and response (MDR), which utilizes advanced artificial intelligence to correlate and\nprioritize threats, determining if they are part of a larger attack. It can detect threats before they are executed, thus preventing further\ncompromise.\n\nThe constant resurgence of new, more sophisticated variants of known malware, as well as the emergence of entirely unknown threats,\n[demand solutions with advanced detection and response capabilities such as Trend Micro Vision One, a technology that can provide powerful](https://www.trendmicro.com/de_de/business/products/detection-response.html)\nXDR capabilities that collect and automatically correlate data across multiple security layers — from email and endpoints to servers, cloud\nworkloads, and networks. Trend Micro Vision One can prevent attacks via automated protection, while also ensuring that no significant\nincidents go unnoticed.\n\n## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)\n\n\n-----\n\nTactic / Technique Notes\n\n**TA0001 Initial Access**\n\n\nT1566.001 Phishing: Spear phishing\nAttachment\n\n\nVictims receive spear phishing emails with attached malicious zip files - typically password\nprotected or HTML file.
