Another similar attack, also](https://twitter.com/HondaCustSvc/status/1270048801307234304)\n[disclosed on Twitter, hit Edesur S.A., one of the companies belonging to Enel Argentina](https://twitter.com/OficialEdesur/status/1269713550114684935)\nwhich operates in the business of energy distribution in the City of Buenos Aires.\n\nBased on samples posted online, these incidents may be tied to the EKANS/SNAKE\n[ransomware family. In this blog post, we review what is known about this ransomware strain](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware)\nand what we have been able to analyze so far.\n\n## Honda Ransomware Attack with a liking for ICS\n\nFirst public mentions of EKANS ransomware date back to January 2020, with security\n[researcher Vitali Kremez sharing information about a new targeted ransomware written in](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1214333066245812224?s=20)\nGOLANG.\n\nThe group appears to have a special interest for Industrial Control Systems (ICS), as\n[detailed in this blog post by security firm Dragos.](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-and-ics-operations/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: EKANS ransom note\n[On June 8, a researcher shared samples of ransomware that supposedly was aimed at](https://twitter.com/milkr3am/status/1269932348860030979?s=20)\nHonda and ENEL INT. When we started looking at the code, we found several artefacts that\ncorroborate this possibility.\n\nFigure 2: Mutex check\nWhen the malware executes, it will try to resolve to a hardcoded hostname\n(mds.honda.com). If, and only if it does, will the file encryption begin. The same logic, with a\nspecific hostname, also applied to the ransomware allegedly tied to Enel.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3:\n\nFunction responsible for performing DNS query\n**Target: Honda**\n\nResolving internal domain: mds.honda.com\nRansom e-mail: CarrolBidell@tutanota[.]com\n\n**Target: Enel**\n\nResolving internal domain: enelint.global\nRansom e-mail: CarrolBidell@tutanota[.]com\n\n### RDP as a possible attack vector\n\nBoth companies had some machines with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access publicly\n[exposed (reference here). RDP attacks are one of the main entry points when it comes to](https://twitter.com/1ZRR4H/status/1270066266137559042?s=20)\ntargeted ransomware opertaions.\n\n\n-----\n\nRDP Exposed: /AGL632956.jpn.mds.honda.com\nRDP Exposed: /IT000001429258.enelint.global\n\nHowever, we cannot say conclusively that this is how threat actors may have gotten in.\nUltimately, only a proper internal investigation will be able to determine exactly how the\nattackers were able to compromise the affected networks.\n\n### Detection\n\nWe tested the ransomware samples publicly available in our lab by creating a fake internal\nserver that would respond to the DNS query made by the malware code with the same IP\naddress it expected. We then ran the sample alleged to be tied to Honda against\n[Malwarebytes Nebula, our cloud-based endpoint protection for businesses.](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/cloud/)\n\nFigure 4: Malwarebytes Nebula dashboard showing detections\nWe detect this payload as ‘Ransom.Ekans’ when it attempts to execute. In order to test\nanother of our protection layers, we also disabled (not recommended) the malware\nprotection to let the behavior engine do its thing. Our anti-ransomware technology was able\nto quarantine the malicious file without the use of any signature.\n\nRansomware gangs have shown no mercy, even in this period of dealing with a pandemic.\nThey continue to target big companies in order to extort large sums of money.\n\nRDP has been called out as some of the lowest hanging fruit preferred by attackers.\n[However, we also recently learned about a new SMB vulnerability allowing remote execution.](https://blog.zecops.com/vulnerabilities/smbleedingghost-writeup-chaining-smbleed-cve-2020-1206-with-smbghost/)\nIt is important for defenders to properly map out all assets, patch them, and never allow them\nto be publicly exposed.\n\nWe will update this blog post if we come across new relevant information.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n-----\n\nHonda related sample:\n```\nd4da69e424241c291c173c8b3756639c654432706e7def5025a649730868c4a1\nmds.honda.com\n\n```\nEnel related sample:\n```\nedef8b955468236c6323e9019abb10c324c27b4f5667bc3f85f3a097b2e5159a\nenelint.global\n\n```\n\n-----",
