If found guilty, the suspects face up to eight years in\nprison.\n\n## A short history of Clop\n\nPrior to today’s arrests, incidents with the Clop ransomware have been documented as early\nas February 2019.\n\nThe gang is what security researchers would call a “big-game hunter,” a term that describes\nransomware groups that go only after large IT networks rather than home consumers.\n\nAcross its more than two years of activity, the Clop gang has breached many large\ncorporations and demanded payments of up to tens of millions of US dollars per victim.\n\nIf companies refused to pay, the Clop gang would resort to a double-extortion tactic and\nthreaten to leak victims’ data on a dark web “leak portal.” The leak site is still up and running\nat the time of writing.\n\nA [November 2020 Fox-IT report claimed the Clop gang had close ties to a malware](https://blog.fox-it.com/2020/11/16/ta505-a-brief-history-of-their-time/)\ndistribution group known as TA505, which would often allow the gang’s members to deploy\nClop ransomware strains on computers previously infected with the SDBbot malware.\n\nA [February 2021 FireEye report also claimed the Clop gang appears to have struck a deal](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/accellion-fta-exploited-for-data-theft-and-extortion.html)\nwith the FIN11 cybercrime group, allowing FIN11 operators to list data the group previously\nstole from hacked Accellion FTA file-sharing devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Clop s South Korean victims get their revenge\n\nThe arrests come in investigations that started back in 2019 when the Clop ransomware\ngang breached four South Korean companies and encrypted their files, asking for huge\npayouts.\n\nSources close to the investigation have told The Record that South Korean police ramped up\nits investigation into the gang last year after the Clop gang infected the network of South\n[Korean e-commerce giant E-Land in November 2020, forcing the Korean company to close](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20201122001900320)\nalmost have of its stores.\n\nIn a rare practice, South Korean police officers were physically present during the raids on\nClop suspects this week, something that is customarily left to local law enforcement\nagencies.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PqGaZgepNTE\n\nTags\n\n[arrests](https://therecord.media/tag/arrests/)\n[Cl0p](https://therecord.media/tag/cl0p/)\n[Clop](https://therecord.media/tag/clop/)\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[FIN11](https://therecord.media/tag/fin11/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[South Korea](https://therecord.media/tag/south-korea/)\n[TA505](https://therecord.media/tag/ta505/)\n[Ukraine](https://therecord.media/tag/ukraine/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
