We were then able to disable the GRU's control\nover those devices before the botnet could be weaponized.\"\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lwJpfC2a3qM\n\n## Malware removed from infected Watchguard and Asus devices\n\nFollowing this US Justice Department operation's initial March 18 court authorization, the\nmalware was removed from all remaining identified Watchguard devices acting as command\nand control servers.\n\nThe FBI has also notified owners of compromised devices in the United States and abroad\nthrough foreign law enforcement partners before removing the Cyclops Blink malware. US\nvictims whose contact info was not found were contacted by their providers following notices\nissued by the FBI.\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray said the botnet was disrupted following close cooperation with\nWatchguard while analyzing the malware and developing detection tools and remediation\ntechniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nI should caution that as we move forward, any Firebox devices that acted as bots, may still\nremain vulnerable in the future until mitigated by their owners. So those owners should still\ngo ahead and adopt Watchguard's detection and remediation steps as soon as possible,\"\nFBI Director Chris Wray added.\n\n\"Sandworm strung them together to use their computing power in a way that would obfuscate\nwho was really running the network and let them launch malware or to orchestrate distributed\ndenial of service attacks, like the GRU has already used to attack Ukraine.\"\n\n[WatchGuard has shared detailed instructions on how to restore compromised](https://techsearch.watchguard.com/KB?type=Article&SFDCID=kA16S000000SNyiSAG&lang=en_US)\nFirebox appliances to a clean state to remediate the infection and update them to the latest\nFireware OS version to prevent future infections.\n\nWatchGuard played an important role in eliminating the threat posed by Cyclops Blink,\nwith the rapid release of detection and remediation tools to protect its partners and\ncustomers following the government disclosure of the malware, and by cooperating\nwith the U. S. Department of Justice in its effort to disrupt the botnet. The company’s\nclose collaboration with its partner and customer communities was instrumental in\nmitigating this sophisticated state-sponsored threat, which affected less than 1% of\nWatchGuard appliances. — WatchGuard spokesperson\n\n## The Sandworm Russian-backed threat group\n\n[Sandworm (also tracked as Voodoo Bear, BlackEnergy, and TeleBots), the group behind the](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/sandworm)\nCyclops Blink botnet, is a Russian-sponsored hacking group active since the mid-2000s.\n\nIts operators are believed to be Russian military hackers part of Unit 74455 of the Russian\nGRU's Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST).\n\nSandworm was linked to the BlackEnergy malware behind blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and\n[2016 [1,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/01/ukraine-and-sandworm-team.html) [2,](https://ics.sans.org/blog/2016/01/09/confirmation-of-a-coordinated-attack-on-the-ukrainian-power-grid?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=25135530&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87XLhYBXFcESdxOIJIB8DSoYBZ5sPrfHQv9xNUp11BwFsfcUBouRDj-R7y6YcJY2BsrUeKvRVbwO4lPcVAPgHLmDrj7w&_hsmi=25135530) [3], the](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/sentinelone-discovers-a-new-delivery-tactic-for-blackenergy-3/) [KillDisk wiper attacks against Ukrainian banks, and highly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/killdisk/)\n[destructive NotPetya ransomware used to inflict billions worth of damage to companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/security-firms-find-thin-lines-connecting-notpetya-to-ukraine-power-grid-attacks/)\nworldwide starting with June 2017.\n\n\"Sandworm is the premier Russian cyber attack capability and one of the actors we have\nbeen most concerned about in light of the invasion,\" John Hultquist, Mandiant VP of\nIntelligence Analysis, told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"We are concerned that they could be used to hit targets in Ukraine, but we are also\nconcerned they may hit targets in the West in retribution for the pressure being placed on\nRussia.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[US, UK link new Cyclops Blink malware to Russian state hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-uk-link-new-cyclops-blink-malware-to-russian-state-hackers/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[US and allies warn of Russian hacking threat to critical infrastructure](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-and-allies-warn-of-russian-hacking-threat-to-critical-infrastructure/)\n\n[US eases sanctions that may lead to Russia's Internet isolation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/us-eases-sanctions-that-may-lead-to-russias-internet-isolation/)\n\n[FTC fines Twitter $150M for using 2FA info for targeted advertising](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/ftc-fines-twitter-150m-for-using-2fa-info-for-targeted-advertising/)\n\n\n-----",
