Having started my\ncareer in high performance computing (HPC) and then having moved into hardened Linux\nsystem architecting, I can say that it is not often we get the chance to study wide-spread\nmalware that targets these operating systems.\n\nKobalos is designed to replace the ssh client and server on a host. Once installed, it\nreplaces the normal ssh to allow collection of passwords to be used to access remote hosts.\nAs the listening service, it creates a backdoor when a client connects with the specific TCP\nsource port of 55201. This specific detail allows us to leverage Team Cymru’s Pure Signal™\nthreat reconnaissance solution to understand the potential size and scope of the Kobalos\nnetwork.\n\nUsing a signature of TCP connections with a destination port of 22 and a source port of\n55201, and removing noise like syn-scanners and other noisy hosts, we were able to look at\nthe past seven days of Internet activity. With search parameters we see 3475 hosts across\n1460 separate ASNs.\n\nGiven the ephemeral and service port combination as the only litmus, it’s possible that this\nport combination seen across the Internet is a coincidence. However, as it is our only IOC\nthat can be applied externally, this will have to do. That said, here is the list of potentially\nimpacted networks.\n\n[https://www.cymru.com/ThreatReports/Kobalos_ASN050221.txt](https://www.cymru.com/ThreatReports/Kobalos_ASN050221.txt)\n\n[The full IP list, and this kind of data, is shared daily via our CSIRT Assistance Program and](https://team-cymru.com/community-services/csirt-ap/)\nour membership in various trust groups. If you see your network listed and you’re not aware\n[of how to get started receiving alerts, please don’t hesitate to contact us.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:outreach@cymru.com%20%20?subject=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20data%20sharing%20with%20Team%20Cymru)\n\nMy thanks again to the fine team at ESET. Without their sharing of these indicators, we\ncouldn’t have looked into the scope of this activity. If you’re a researcher and have an IOC\n[you’d like to see matched against our Pure Signal intelligence, drop me a line!](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:dmonnier@cymru.com?subject=I%27d%20like%20to%20see%20what%20you%20know%20about%20an%20IOC%20I%27ve%20found)\n\n\n-----",
