We found a new variant of the ShadowPad backdoor, the group’s\nflagship backdoor, deployed using a new launcher and embedding numerous modules. The\nWinnti malware was also found at these universities a few weeks prior to ShadowPad.\n\nThe Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for for high-profile supply-chain\nattacks against the video game and software industries leading to the distribution of trojanized\n[software (such as CCleaner, ASUS LiveUpdate and multiple video games) that is then used](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/cconsiderations-on-ccleaner-incident/)\nto compromise more victims. It is also known for having compromised various targets in the\nhealthcare and education sectors.\n\n[ESET researchers recently published a white paper updating our understanding of the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/14/connecting-dots-exposing-arsenal-methods-winnti/)\narsenal of the Winnti Group, following a blog post documenting a supply-chain attack\ntargeting the videogame industry in Asia. Additionally, we published a blog post on a new\nbackdoor named skip-2.0 that targets Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nThis article focuses on the technical details of this new ShadowPad variant.\n\n_About the “Winnti Group” naming:_\n\n_We have chosen to keep the name “Winnti Group” since it’s the name first used to identify it,_\n_in 2013, by Kaspersky. Since Winnti is also a malware family, we always write “Winnti Group”_\n_when we refer to the malefactors behind the attacks. Since 2013, it has been demonstrated_\n_that Winnti is only one of the many malware families used by the Winnti Group._\n\n## ShadowPad found at several Hong Kong universities\n\n[In November 2019, ESET’s machine-learning engine, Augur, detected a malicious and unique](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/20/machine-learning-eset-road-augur/)\nsample present on multiple computers belonging to two Hong Kong universities where the\nWinnti malware had already been found at the end of October. The suspicious sample\ndetected by Augur is actually a new 32-bit ShadowPad launcher. Samples from both\nShadowPad and Winnti found at these universities contain campaign identifiers and C&C\nURLs with the names of the universities, which indicates a targeted attack.\n\nIn addition to the two compromised universities, thanks to the C&C URL format used by the\nattackers we have reasons to think that at least three additional Hong Kong universities may\nhave been compromised using these same ShadowPad and Winnti variants.\n\nThis campaign of the Winnti Group against Hong Kong universities was taking place in the\ncontext of Hong Kong facing civic protests that started in June 2019 triggered by an\nextradition bill. Even though the bill was withdrawn in October 2019, protests continued,\n\n\n-----\n\ndemanding full democracy and investigation of the Hong Kong police. These protests\ngathered hundreds of thousands of people in the streets with large support from students of\nHong Kong universities, leading to multiple university campus occupations by the protesters.\n\nWe have contacted the compromised universities and provided the necessary information\nand assistance to remediate the compromise.\n\n### Updated launcher\n\nUnlike previous ShadowPad variants documented in our white paper on the arsenal of the\nWinnti Group, this launcher is not obfuscated using VMProtect. Furthermore, the encrypted\npayload is neither embedded in the overlay nor located in a COM1:NULL.dat alternate data\nstream. And the usual RC5 encryption with a key derived from the volume ID of the system\ndrive of the victim machine (as seen in the PortReuse backdoor, skip-2.0 and some\nShadowPad variants) is not present either. In this case, the launcher is much simpler.\n\n### DLL side-loading\n\nThe launcher is a 32-bit DLL named hpqhvsei.dll, which is the name of a legitimate DLL\nloaded by hpqhvind.exe. This executable is from HP and is usually installed with their printing\nand scanning software called “HP Digital Imaging”. In this case the legitimate hpqhvind.exe\nwas dropped by the attackers, along with their malicious hpqhvsei.dll, in C:\\Windows\\Temp.\n\nAlthough we do not have the component that dropped and executed this launcher, the\npresence of these files leads us to think that the initial execution of this launcher is done\nthrough DLL side-loading.\n\nWhen the malicious DLL is loaded at hpqhvind.exe startup, its DLLMain function is called that\nwill check its parent process for the following sequence of bytes at offset 0x10BA:\n\n85 C0 ; test eax, eax\n\n0F 84 ; jz\n\nIn the case where the parent process is hpqhvind.exe, this sequence of bytes is present at\nthis exact location and the malicious DLL will proceed to patch the parent process in memory.\nIt replaces the original instructions at 0x10BA with an unconditional jump (jmp – 0xE9) to the\naddress of the function from hpqhvsei.dll that decrypts and executes the encrypted payload\nembedded in the launcher.\n\nThe decompiled function responsible for patching the parent process is shown in Figure 1. In\ncase hpqhvsei.dll is loaded by a different process than hpqhvind.exe, the malicious code will\nnot be decrypted and executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Decompiled function responsible for patching the parent process_\n\nThe difference between the original and patched hpqhvind.exe is shown in Figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2. Difference between original (left) and patched (right) hpqhvind.exe_\n\nThe part of the code that is patched is located at the very beginning of the main function of\nhpqhvind.exe. As we can see in Figure 2, the patched code is located right after the load of\nhpqhvsei.dll. This means that the function responsible for decrypting and executing the\npayload is executed directly after the load of the malicious DLL.\n\n### Payload decryption\n\nThe encrypted payload is located in the .rdata section of hpqhvsei.dll and the decryption\nalgorithm is an XOR loop where the XOR key is updated at each iteration, as shown in Figure\n3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Pseudocode of the payload decryption loop_\n\nThe decrypted payload is the usual shellcode responsible for ShadowPad initialization\n(obfuscated using fake conditional jumps to hinder disassembly).\n\n### Persistence\n\nAfter having been decrypted, ShadowPad’s shellcode is executed. It will first achieve\npersistence on the system by writing the in-memory patched parent process to disk to a path\nspecified in the configuration string pool. In the case we examined, the path was\nC:\\ProgramData\\DRM\\CLR\\CLR.exe. It then creates a service named\nclr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32, which is responsible for executing CLR.exe. To avoid\nsuspicion, this service name, as well as the executable name, were chosen to look similar to\nthe name of a Microsoft .NET optimization Service.\n\nThe full staging process is summarized in Figure 4. The numbering on each arrow\ncorresponds to the chronological sequence of events.\n\n_Figure 4. ShadowPad staging process_\n\n### Modules\n\nShadowPad is a multimodular backdoor where the modules are referenced from the Root\nmodule with a circular list from which one can extract the module address, a UNIX timestamp\n(probably embedded automatically during the module’s compilation process) and a module\nidentifier. From the module itself we can also extract the name the developer gave to the\nmodule. This version embeds the 17 modules listed in the following table:\n\n_Table 1.

Notice the “Servcie” typo.](https://published-prd.lanyonevents.com/published/rsaus18/sessionsFiles/8739/HTA-T10_CCleaner%20APT%20Attack-A%20Technical%20Look%20Inside.pdf)\n\nAs usual, all the module timestamps are spread over a short time range, which could suggest\nthe use of a build framework to compile these modules. This also suggests that these\nmodules were built a few hours before the launcher itself, whose compilation timestamp is\nThu Oct 24 14:10:32 2019. Since this compilation timestamp dates back two weeks before\nthis campaign, it’s likely that it hasn’t been tampered with by the attackers.\n\nOne might also note that the number of modules embedded in this variant is much higher (17)\nthan the number of modules embedded in the variants previously documented in our white\npaper (8 to 10 modules).\n\nBy default, every keystroke is recorded using the Keylogger module (306, previously\ndocumented by Avast) and saved to disk in the file\n%APPDATA%\\PAGM\\OEY\\XWWEYG\\WAOUE.\n\nThe log file is encrypted using the same algorithm as the one used to encrypt static strings\nfrom the module. Using this module by default indicates that the attackers are interested in\nstealing information from the victims’ machines. In contrast, the variants we described in our\nwhite paper didn’t even have that module embedded.\n\n### Configuration\n\nAs with previous ShadowPad variants, the Config module (102) contains an encrypted string\npool that can be accessed from any other module. The string pool is never stored entirely\ndecrypted in memory; the field of interest is decrypted when needed and then immediately\nfreed (thus quickly unavailable). The configuration size is 2180 bytes and the encrypted\nstrings are located at offset 0x84. The algorithm used to decrypt the strings is the same as\nthe one used to decrypt the static strings of the module. The decrypted content of the string\npool is the following:\n\n0x84: 2019/11/7 16:28:36\n\n0x99: CAMPAIGN_ID_REDACTED\n\n0xa1: %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\DRM\\CLR\\CLR.exe\n\n0xc5: clr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32\n\noxe6: clr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32\n\n0x107: clr_optimization_v4.0.30229_32\n\n0x128: SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\n0x158: CLR\n\n0x15e: %ProgramFiles%\\Windows Media Player\\wmplayer.exe\n\n0x197: %windir%\\system32\\svchost.exe\n\n0x1b7: TCP://b[redacted].dnslookup.services:443\n\n\n-----\n\n0x1db: UDP://b[redacted].dnslookup.services:443\n0x202: SOCKS4\n0x21e: SOCKS5\n\nThe campaign ID is located at offset 0x99 and is the name of the targeted university. Having a\ncampaign ID related to the target is quite common in the case of ShadowPad and Winnti.\n\nInterestingly, the timestamp present in this config at offset 0x84 is later than the modules’\ntimestamps and the loader compilation timestamp. This suggests that this config is added\nmanually to the sample after having been built. Even though it’s probably coincidental, the\ndate within the config corresponds to the date of the first detection of this sample at the\ncorresponding university.\n\n### Network Communications\n\nOnce installed on the system, ShadowPad starts a hidden and suspended Microsoft Windows\nMedia Player wmplayer.exe process and injects itself into that process. The path to\nwmplayer.exe is provided by the Config module.\n\nOnce ShadowPad is injected into wmplayer.exe, the Online module will contact the C&C\nserver using the URL specified in the configuration. It will then start listening for connections\non port 13567 after having updated firewall rules accordingly:\n\nRegistry key:\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\FirewallRules\\\n{816381AB-1400-45E5-B560-B8E11C5988CF}\n\nValue:\n\nv2.10|Action=Allow|Active=TRUE|Dir=In|Protocol=6|Profile=Public|LPort=13567|Name=Network\nDiscovery (TCP)|\n\nThe communication is then handled by the TCP module (200), which was previously\n[documented by Kaspersky.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2017/08/07172148/ShadowPad_technical_description_PDF.pdf)\n\n## Winnti malware was there as well\n\nIn addition to ShadowPad, the Winnti malware was found on some machines at these two\nuniversities at the end of October (i.e. two weeks before ShadowPad) in the file\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\oci.dll and is detected by ESET products as Win64/Winnti.CA.\n\nThe Winnti malware usually contains a configuration specifying a campaign ID and a C&C\nURL. On all machines the campaign ID matches the name of the targeted university and the\nC&C URLs are:\n\nw[redacted].livehost.live:443\nw[redacted].dnslookup.services:443\n\n\n-----\n\nwhere the redacted part corresponds to the name of the targeted university.\n\n## C&C URL format\n\nOne can observe that the C&C URL used by both Winnti and ShadowPad complies to the\nscheme [backdoor_type][target_name].domain.tld:443 where [backdoor_type] is a single\nletter which is either “w” in the case of the Winnti malware or “b” in the case of ShadowPad.\n\nFrom this format, we were able to find several C&C URLs, including three additional Hong\nKong universities’ names. The campaign identifiers found in the samples we’ve analyzed\nmatch the subdomain part of the C&C server, showing that these samples were really\ntargeted against these universities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Winnti Group is still actively using one of its flagship backdoors, ShadowPad, this time\nagainst Hong Kong universities. In this campaign, the VMProtected launcher used with\nShadowPad, as well as with the PortReuse backdoor and skip-2.0, was replaced by a simpler\none. That these samples, in addition to having been found at these universities, contain\ncampaign IDs matching the universities’ names and use C&C URLs containing the\nuniversities’ names are good indications that this campaign is highly targeted.\n\nWe will continue to monitor new activities of the Winnti Group and will publish relevant\n[information on our blog.
