    "plain_text": "# The CCleaner Malware Fiasco Targeted at Least 18 Specific Tech Firms\n\n**wired.com/story/ccleaner-malware-targeted-tech-firms**\n\nAndy Greenberg September 21, 2017\n\n_Update: On September 25, Avast_ _[confirmed that of the 18 companies targeted, a total of 40](https://blog.avast.com/additional-information-regarding-the-recent-ccleaner-apt-security-incident)_\n_computers were successfully infected with a secondary malware installation at the following_\n_companies: Samsung, Sony, Asus, Intel, VMWare, O2, Singtel, Gauselmann, Dyn,_\n_Chunghwa and Fujitsu._\n\nHundreds of thousands of computers getting penetrated by a corrupted version of an ultracommon piece of security software was never going to end well. But now it's becoming clear\nexactly how bad the results of the recent CCleaner malware outbreak may be. Researchers\nnow believe that the hackers behind it were bent not only on mass infections, but on targeted\nespionage that tried to gain access to the networks of at least 18 tech firms.\n\nEarlier this week, security firms Morphisec and Cisco revealed that CCleaner, a piece of\nsecurity software distributed by Czech company Avast, had been hijacked by hackers and\nloaded with a backdoor that evaded the company's security checks. It wound up installed on\nmore than 700,000 computers. On Wednesday, researchers at Cisco's Talos security division\n[revealed that they've now analyzed the hackers' \"command-and-control\" server to which](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/ccleaner-c2-concern.html)\nthose malicious versions of CCleaner connected.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn that server, they found evidence that the hackers had attempted to filter their collection of\nbackdoored victim machines to find computers inside the networks of 18 tech firms, including\nIntel, Google, Microsoft, Akamai, Samsung, Sony, VMware, HTC, Linksys, D-Link and Cisco\nitself. In about half of those cases, says Talos research manager Craig Williams, the hackers\nsuccessfully found a machine they'd compromised within the company's network, and used\ntheir backdoor to infect it with another piece of malware intended to serve as a deeper\nfoothold, one that Cisco now believes was likely intended for industrial espionage.2\n\n\"When we found this initially, we knew it had infected a lot of companies,\" says Williams.\n\"Now we know this was being used as a dragnet to target these [companies] worldwide...to\nget footholds in companies that have valuable things to steal, including Cisco unfortunately.\"\n\nA Wide Net\n\nCisco says it obtained a digital copy of the hackers' command-and-control server from an\nunnamed source involved in the CCleaner investigation. The server contained a database of\nevery backdoored computer that had \"phoned home\" to the hackers' machine between\nSeptember 12 and 16. That included over 700,000 PCs, just as Avast has said in the days\nsince it first revealed its CCleaner debacle. (Initially the company put the number much\nhigher, at 2.27 million.) But the database also showed a list of specific domains onto which\nthe hackers sought to install their secondary malware payload, as well as which ones\nreceived that second infection.\n\nThe secondary payload targeted 18 companies in all, but Williams notes that some\ncompanies had more than one computer compromised, and some had none. He declined to\nsay which of the targets had in fact been breached, but Cisco says it's alerted all the affected\ncompanies to the attack.\n\nWilliams also notes the target list Cisco found likely isn't comprehensive; it appears to have\nbeen \"trimmed,\" he says. It may have included evidence of other targets, successfully\nbreached or not, that the hackers had sought to infect with their secondary payload earlier in\nthe month-long period when the corrupted version of CCleaner was being distributed. \"It’s\nvery likely they modified this through the monthlong campaign, and it’s almost certain that\nthey changed the list around as they progressed and probably targeted even more\ncompanies,\" says Williams.\n\nIn an [update post Thursday morning, Avast backed Cisco's findings, and confirmed that eight](https://blog.avast.com/progress-on-ccleaner-investigation)\nof the 18 known target companies had been breached by the hackers. But it also wrote that\nthe total number of victim firms \"was likely at least in the order of hundreds.\"1\n\nThat target list presents a new wrinkle in the unfolding analysis of the CCleaner attack, one\nthat shifts it from what might have otherwise been a run-of-the-mill mass cybercrime scheme\nto a potentially state-sponsored spying operation that cast a wide net, and then filtered it for\n[specific tech-industry victims. Cisco and security firm Kaspersky have both pointed out that](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/910059453948579840)\n\n\n-----\n\nthe malware element in the tainted version of CCleaner shares some code with a\nsophisticated hacking group known as Group 72, or Axiom, which security firm Novetta\nnamed a Chinese government operation in 2015.\n\nCisco concedes that code reuse alone doesn't represent a definitive link between the\nCCleaner attack and Axiom, not to mention China. But it also notes that one configuration file\non the attackers' server was set for China's time zone—while still acknowledging that's not\nenough for attribution.\n\nSupply Chain Woes\n\nFor any company that may have had computers running the corrupted version of CCleaner\non their network, Cisco warns that its findings mean merely deleting that application is no\nguarantee the CCleaner backdoor wasn't used to plant a secondary piece of malware on\ntheir network, one with its own, still-active command and control server. Instead, the\nresearchers recommend that anyone affected fully restore their machines from backup\nversions prior to the installation of Avast's tainted security program. \"If you didn’t restore your\nsystem from backup, you’re at high risk of not having cleaned this up,\" Williams says.\n\nThe exact dimensions of the CCleaner attack will likely continue to be redrawn, as analysis\ncontinues. But it already represents another serious example in the string of software supplychain attacks that have recently rocked the internet. Two months earlier, hackers hijacked\nthe update mechanism of the Ukrainian accounting software MeDoc to deliver a destructive\n[piece of software known as NotPetya, causing massive damage to companies in Ukraine as](https://www.wired.com/story/petya-ransomware-outbreak-eternal-blue/)\nwell as in Europe and the United States. In that case, as in the CCleaner attack, victims\ninstalled seemingly legitimate software from a small but trusted company, only to find that it\nhad been silently corrupted, deeply infecting their IT systems.\n\nIn the days following the NotPetya attack, many in the security research community shifted\ntheir assessment of the attack from a criminal ransomware outbreak to something more\n[insidious, targeted, and created by nation-state hackers. Now, it seems that the mystery](https://www.wired.com/story/petya-ransomware-ukraine/)\nsurrounding the CCleaner attack may be moving in that same, disturbing direction.\n\n1Updated 9/21/2017 11:15am with a comment from Avast. Correction 9/21/2017 1:08pm to2\n\n_change the number of total companies targeted to 18. While Cisco had initially reported 20,_\n_that number had counted some different domains of companies separately. Updated3_\n_9/25/2017 4:20PM EST with additional information from Avast._\n\n\n-----",
