Alongside goals like\n\ncyberespionage and cybersabotage, the attacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies\n\naround the globe. Over the last few months, Lazarus has successfully compromised several banks and\n\ninfiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies.\n\nKaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response efforts. While investigating a cryptocurrency\n\nexchange attacked by Lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the\n\nhelp of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company\n\nover email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third\nparty application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware\n\nknown as Fallchill, an old tool that Lazarus has recently switched back to. There have been multiple reports\n\n[on the reappearance of Fallchill, including one from US-CERT.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-318A)\n\nTo ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the\n\nextra mile and developed malware for other platforms, including for macOS. A version for Linux is\n\napparently coming soon, according to the website. It’s probably the first time we see this APT group using\n\n\n-----\n\ng p p g p g y p\n\nfor users of non-Windows platforms.\n\n## Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application\n\nThanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security\n\nsoftware, we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This\n\nhelped us understand that one of Lazarus’ victims was infected with malware after installing a\n\ncryptocurrency trading program. We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link\n\ndelivered over email.\n\n### Trojanized trading application for Windows\n\nIncluding malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious.\n\nInstead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an\n\nupdate for a trading application.\n\n[A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious](https://www.celasllc.com/)\n\nbehaviour and looked genuine. This application is an all-in-one style cryptocurrency trading program\n\ndeveloped by Celas.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Screenshot of Celas Trade Pro_\n\nWhen we started this research, any user could download the trading application from the Celas website.\n\nChecking the installation package downloaded from the website confirmed the presence of a very\n\nsuspicious updater.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Installation package download page_\n\nWe have analyzed the following Windows version of the installation package:\n\nMD5: 9e740241ca2acdc79f30ad2c3f50990a\n\nFile name: celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi\n\nFile type: MSI installer\n\nCreation time: 2018-06-29 01:16:00 UTC\n\nAt the end of the installation process, the installer immediately runs the Updater.exe module with the\n\n“CheckUpdate” parameter. This file looks like a regular tool and most likely will not arouse the suspicion of\n\nsystem administrators. After all, it even contains a valid digital signature, which belongs to the same vendor.\n\nBut the devil is in the detail, as usual.\n\nThe code writer developed this project under the codename “jeus”, which was discovered in a PDB path\n\n\n-----\n\nProperties of the shady updater tool included in the package are:\n\nMD5: b054a7382adf6b774b15f52d971f3799\n\nFile Type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\nKnown file name: %Program Files%\\CelasTradePro\\Updater.exe\n\nLink Time: 2018-06-15 10:56:27 UTC\n\nBuild path: Z:\\jeus\\downloader\\downloader_exe_vs2010\\Release\\dloader.pdb\n\nThe main purpose of Updater.exe is to collect the victim’s host information and send it back to the server.\n\nUpon launch, the malware creates a unique string with the format string template “%09d-%05d” based on\n\nrandom values, which is used as a unique identifier of the infected host. This malware collects process lists,\n\nexcluding “[System Process]” and “System” processes and gets the exact OS version from the registry value\n\nat “HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion”. It seems that such values only exist from\n\nWindows 10, so we assume that the author developed and tested it on Windows 10.\n\nProductName: Windows OS version\n\nCurrentBuildNumber: Windows 10 build version\n\nReleaseID: Windows 10 version information\n\nUBR: Sub version of Windows 10 build\n\nBuildBranch: Windows 10 build branch information\n\nThe code encrypts the collected information with the hardcoded XOR key (“Moz&Wie;#t/6T!2y“) before\n\nuploading it to the server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Data encryption routine_\n\nThe code sends the victim’s information to a webserver using HTTP and the following URL:\n\nwww.celasllc[.]com/checkupdate.php\n\nThe server is a legitimate looking website owned by the developer of the program: Celas LLC. At this point\n\nwe were not able to conclude with high confidence whether the server was compromised by the threat\n\nactor or had belonged to the threat actor from the beginning. To learn more about the server, please read\n\nthe “Infrastructure” section below.\n\nThe malware used a hardcoded User-Agent string “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1;\n\nTrident/6.0)” and fixed a multipart form data separator string “jeus“.\n\nUsing encryption, the custom separator string wouldn’t be a red flag for a legitimate application, but\n\nsending a request with the context-irrelevant string “get_config”, as well as uploading collected system\n\ninformation as “temp.gif”, mimicking a GIF image with a magic number in the header, definitely made us\n\nraise our eyebrows.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter successfully uploading data, the updater checks the server response. If the server responds with HTTP\n\ncode 300, it means the updater should keep quiet and take no action. However, if the response is HTTP\n\ncode 200, it extracts the payload with base64 and decrypts it using RC4 with another hardcoded key\n\n(“W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd“). The decrypted data is an executable file that is prepended with the\n\n“MAX_PATHjeusD” string.\n\nDuring our research, we found other similar files. One was created on August 3rd and another on August\n\n11th. The PDB path shows that the author keeps improving this updater tool, apparently forked from some\n\nstable version released on July 2, 2018 according to the internal directory name.\n\nAdditional trojanized sample #1 Additional trojanized sample #1\n\n\n4126e1f34cf282c354e17587bb6\nInstallation package MD5\n\ne8da3\n\n\n0bdb652bbe15942e866083f29f\n\nb6dd62\n\n\nPackage creation date 2018-08-03 09:57:29 2018-08-13 0:12:10\n\n\nffae703a1e327380d85880b9037\nDropped updater MD5\n\na0aeb\n\n\nbbbcf6da5a4c352e8846bf91c33\n\n58d5c\n\n\nUpdater creation date 2018-08-03 09:50:08 2018-08-11 7:28:08\n\n\nH:\\DEV\\TManager\\DLoader\\201\n\n80702\\dloader\\WorkingDir\\Out\n\nput\\00000006\\Release\\dloader.\n\npdb\n\n\nUpdater Build path\n\n\nH:\\DEV\\TManager\\DLoader\\201\n\n80702\\dloader\\WorkingDir\\Out\n\nput\\00000009\\Release\\dloader.\n\npdb\n\n\nNote the TManager directory in the PDB path from the table. It will pop up again in another unexpected\n\nplace later.\n\n### Trojanized trading program for macOS\n\nFor macOS users Celas LLC also provided a native version of its trading app A hidden “autoupdater”\n\n\n-----\n\nexecutable from the server. The communication conforms to the Windows version of the updater and is\n\ndisguised as an image file upload and download, while carrying encrypted data inside.\n\nWe have analyzed the following installation file:\n\nMD5: 48ded52752de9f9b73c6bf9ae81cb429\n\nFile Size: 15,020,544 bytes\n\nFile Type: DMG disk image\n\nKnown file name: celastradepro_mac_installer_1.00.00.dmg\n\nDate of creation: 13 July 2018\n\nOnce the Cellas Trade Pro app is installed on macOS, it starts the Updater application on the system load via\n\na file named “.com.celastradepro.plist” (note that it starts with a dot symbol, which makes it unlisted in the\n\nFinder app or default Terminal directory listing). The “Updater” file is passed the “CheckUpdate” parameter\n\non start.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe command-line argument “CheckUpdate” looks redundant from a code analysis perspective: there is no\n\nother argument that the application expects. In the absence of all arguments, it doesn’t do anything and\n\nquits. This may or may not be way to trick sandboxes that could automatically execute this trojan updater,\n\nwith no suspicious activity produced without such a “secret” extra argument. The choice of a benign string\n\nsuch as “CheckUpdate” helps it to hide in plain sight of any user or administrator looking into running\n\nprocesses.\n\nThe trojanized updater works similar to the Windows version in many ways. Both applications are\n\n[implemented using a cross-platform QT framework. Upon launch, the downloader creates a unique](https://www.qt.io/)\n\nidentifier for the infected host using a “%09d-%06d” format string template. Next, the app collects basic\n\nsystem information, which for macOS is done via dedicated QT classes:\n\nHost name\n\nOS type and version\n\nSystem architecture\n\nOS kernel type and version\n\nThe process of encrypting and transferring data is the same as in the Windows version. This information is\n\nXOR-encrypted with hardcoded 16-byte static key “Moz&Wie;#t/6T!2y”, prepended with GIF89a header\n\nand uploaded to the C2 server via HTTP POST and the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.celasllc[.]com/checkupdate.php\n\n\n-----\n\n_POST request template strings_\n\nThe module relies on a hardcoded User-Agent string for macOS:\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\n\nChrome/66.0.3359.139 Safari/537.36\n\nOnce the server replies, it checks the HTTP response code. HTTP response code 300 indicates that the\n\nserver has no task for the updater and the application terminates immediately. If the HTTP response is code\n\n200, then the updater gets the data in the response, decodes it from base64 encoding and decrypts it using\n\nRC4 with the hardcoded static key “W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd“. It calculates the MD5 of the decoded and\n\ndecrypted data, which is compared to a value stored inside, to verify the integrity of the transferred file.\n\nAfter that, the payload is extracted and saved to a hardcoded file location “/var/zdiffsec“, sets executable\n\npermissions for all users and starts the app with another secret hardcoded command-line argument\n\n“bf6a0c760cc642“. Apparently the command-line argument is the way to prevent the detection of its\n\nmalicious functionality via sandboxes or even reverse engineering. We have previously seen this technique\n\nadopted by Lazarus group in 2016 in attacks against banks. As of 2018, it is still using this in almost every\n\nattack we investigated.\n\n## Downloaded payload\n\nAccording to data from Kaspersky Security Network, the threat actor delivered the malicious payload using\n\none of the shadowy updaters described above. We found a malicious file created at the same host:\n\nMD5: 0a15a33844c9df11f12a4889ae7b7e4b\n\nFile Size: 104,898,560 bytes\n\nFile Type: PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\nKnown file name: C:\\Recovery\\msn.exe\n\nLink time: 2018-04-19 13:30:19\n\nNote the unusually large size for an executable file We believe that it was inflated with junk data on\n\n\n-----\n\nSearching for the reason for the malware’s appearance on the system revealed that there was an additional\n\nprocess responsible for producing several files before this malware was launched, suggesting a trojan\n\ndropper in action. The main function of this malware is to implant the Fallchill backdoor loader linked to\n\nseveral files. Upon launch, the malware checks one of the command-line arguments passed to it. The\n\nmalware chooses one of the service names located in the following registry value as a disguise:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost\\netsvcs\n\nThis value includes a list of several dozen standard system service names.\n\nThe randomly chosen service name is used to name the dropped file and newly registered Windows service.\n\nLet’s refer to this randomly chosen service name as [service]. The malware contains references to several\n\nfiles inside:\n\nThe file passed as argument: contains a 16-byte key\n\nmsncf.dat: Encrypted configuration data\n\nmsndll.tmp: Encrypted Fallchill loader\n\nmsndll.dat: Encrypted Fallchill backdoor (payload for the loader)\n\n_[service]svc.dll: Fallchill backdoor loader_\n\n_[service].dat: Copy of msndll.dat_\n\nA mix of the above-mentioned files produces the final backdoor known as Fallchill. A more detailed\n\nprocedure for technical specialists is as follows:\n\n1. Check whether the command-line argument points to a file of 16 byte size.\n\n2. Read the file passed via the command-line argument. The contents of this file contains a crypto key,\n\nwhich we will call the main key.\n\n3. Open the msncf.dat file (configuration file). If the file size equals 192 bytes, read the content of the file.\n\n4 Open msndll tmp file and decrypt it using the main key\n\n\n-----\n\n10240) times. This is why it produces files which are at least 104,851,000 bytes.\n\n6. Copy the 16-byte main key at the end of the [service]svc.dll file.\n\n7. Encrypt the [service].dat file name with the main key and append it at the end of [service]svc.dll.\n\n8. Overwrite the beginning of [service]svc.dll with data decrypted from msndll.tmp.\n\n9. Move msndll.dat file to [service].dat.\n\n10. Delete temporary files: msndll.tmp, msncf.dat, msndll.log.\n\n11. Timestamp [service]svc.dll and [service].dat files.\n\n12. Register [service]svc.dll as a Windows service.\n\n13. Save a copy of data from msncf.dat file in the following registry value\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\TaskConfigs\\Description.\n\n_Infection process diagram_\n\n### Fallchill backdoor loader\n\nWe confirmed that the following malware was created on the infected host using the method described\n\nabove:\n\n\n-----\n\nMD5: e1ed584a672cab33af29114576ad6cce\n\nFile Size: 104,878,356 bytes\n\nFile Type: PE32+ executable (DLL) (console) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\nKnown file name: C:\\Windows\\system32\\uploadmgrsvc.dll\n\nLink time: 2018-01-18 01:56:32\n\nEncrypted Fallchill backdoor:\n\nMD5: d8484469587756ce0d10a09027044808\n\nFile Size: 143,872 bytes\n\nFile Type: encrypted data\n\nKnown file name: C:\\Windows\\system32\\uploadmgr.dat\n\nUpon starting, uploadmgrsvc.dll reads 276 bytes from the end of its own executable file. The first 16 bytes\n\nof this 276-byte data are used as a decryption key, and the remaining 260 bytes contain the encrypted file\n\npath used by the backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Data at the end of the loader module_\n\nAfter decryption of the last 260-bytes, the malware retrieves the name or path of the file that contains the\n\nactual backdoor body in encrypted form.\n\n_Decrypted file name in the end of loader module_\n\nThe malware reads the specified file and decrypts it using the same decryption routine. This is how the\n\nexecutable code of the backdoor is produced in memory and executed by the loader. Below is the meta\n\ninformation about the decrypted final payload in memory:\n\nMD5: d7089e6bc8bd137a7241a7ad297f975d\n\nFile Size: 143,872 bytes\n\nFile Type: PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\nLink Time: 2018-03-16 07:15:31\n\nWe can summarize the Fallchill backdoor loading process as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Loading the Fallchill backdoor_\n\nAs mentioned previously, the final payload belongs to a Fallchill malware cluster formerly attributed to the\n\nLazarus APT group. Upon launching, this malware resolves the API function addresses at runtime, and reads\n\nthe C2 server address from the registry value created during the installation stage:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\TaskConfigs\\Description\n\nIf there is no configuration value, the malware falls back to a default C2 server address.\n\n196.38.48[.]121\n\n185.142.236[.]226\n\nThis is a full-featured backdoor that contains enough functions to fully control the infected host. Some of\n\nits network protocol commands are described below.\n\nCommand\n\nDescription\nID\n\n\n-----\n\n0x8002 Replace configuration data in the fixed registry value\n\n0x8003 Execute Windows command, store output in temp file and upload\n\ncontents to C2\n\n0x8006 Show current working directory\n\n0x8007 Change current working directory\n\n0x8008 Collect process information\n\n0x8009 Terminate process\n\n0x8010 Start new process\n\n0x8011 Create process with security context of the current user\n\n0x8012 Connect to specified host/port\n\n0x8013 Get drive information\n\n0x8014 Directory listing\n\n0x8015 Search a file\n\n0x8019 Write data to a specified file\n\n0x8020 Read contents of specified file and upload to C2 server\n\n\nCompress multiples files to a temp file (name start with ZD) and\n0x8021\n\nupload to C2\n\n0x8023 Wipe specific file\n\n0x8025 Copy file time from another file time (timestamping)\n\n0x8026 Shutdown malware service and self-delete\n\nSend “Not Service” unicode string to C2 server (communication\n0x8043\n\ntest?).\n\nThis set of capabilities is very common for many Lazarus backdoors, which have been seen in other attacks\n\nagainst banks and financial industry in the past years.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nstatus of the Celas LLC company that developed this trojanized trading application.\n\n_Celas LLC main homepage._\n\nThe website had a valid SSL certificate issued by Comodo CA.

The key extracted\n\nfrom the Fallchill variant used in the current attack is DA E1 61 FF 0C 27 95 87 17 57 A4 D6 EA E3 82 2B.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Current RC4 key of Fallchill_\n\nWe were able to confirm that some of older Fallchill malware variants used exactly the same RC4 key.\n\nBelow are Fallchill malware samples that used the same key (the compilation timestamp may indicate the\n\ndate of malware creation).\n\nMD5 Timestamp\n\n81c3a3c5a0129477b59397173fdc0b01 2017-05-26 23:37:04\n\n6cb34af551b3fb63df6c9b86900cf044 2017-06-09 17:24:30\n\n21694c8db6234df74102e8b5994b7627 2017-11-07 17:54:19\n\n5ad7d35f0617595f26d565a3b7ebc6d0 2015-10-24 01:52:11\n\nc501ea6c56ba9133c3c26a7d5ed4ce49 2017-06-09 03:59:43\n\ncafda7b3e9a4f86d4bd005075040a712 2017-11-07 17:54:33\n\ncea1a63656fb199dd5ab90528188e87c 2017-06-12 19:25:31\n\n6b061267c7ddeb160368128a933d38be 2017-11-09 17:18:06\n\n56f5088f488e50999ee6cced1f5dd6aa 2017-06-13 08:17:51\n\ncd6796f324ecb7cf34bc9bc38ce4e649 2016-04-17 03:26:56\n\n### Same C2 server with older Fallchill\n\n\n-----\n\nbeen used by the older variant of Fallchill.\n\nMD5 Timestamp\n\n94dfcabd8ba5ca94828cd5a88d6ed488 2016-10-24 02:31:18\n\n14b6d24873f19332701177208f85e776 2017-06-07 06:41:27\n\nabec84286df80704b823e698199d89f7 2017-01-18 04:29:29\n\n_Overlap of C2 infrastructure_\n\nApparently, the attackers using the Fallchill malware continue to reuse code and C2 server infrastructure\n\nover and over again.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Security Network, Fallchill was not the only malware used in this attack. There was\n\nanother backdoor that was used by the threat actor. We omit a full description of this backdoor in the\n\ncurrent report to keep the write-up to an acceptable length, but we would like to highlight two important\n\nthings discovered in it. First, this backdoor was created on 2018-07-12 and revealed an already familiar\n\ndi t “TM ” hi h i l i th U d t li ti f th C ll T di P\n\n\n-----\n\nH:\\DEV\\TManager\\all_BOSS_troy\\T_4.2\\T_4.2\\Server_\\x64\\Release\\ServerDll.pdb\n\nSecond, what is probably one of the most interesting findings to come from this additional backdoor was\n\ndiscovered hidden in hardcoded headers used to communicate with C2 server. The Accept-Language HTTP\n\nheader string revealed a language code associated with North Korea. In our experience, this is something\n\nwe normally don’t see in malware.\n\nAccept-Language: ko-kp,ko-kr;q=0.8,ko;q=0.6,en-us;q=0.4,en;q=0.2\n\n_Accept-Language HTTP header value in the body of the backdoor_\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe Lazarus APT group’s continuous attacks on the financial sector are not much of a surprise to anyone. A\n\nlot of research has been done and published about such attacks. However, we think this case makes a\n\ndifference. Recent investigation shows how aggressive the group is and how its strategies may evolve in the\n\nfuture.\n\nFirst of all, Lazarus group has entered a new platform: macOS. There is steadily growing interest in macOS\n\nfrom ordinary users, especially in IT companies. Many developers and engineers are switching to using\n\nmacOS. Apparently, in the chase after advanced users, software developers from supply chains and some\n\nhigh profile targets, threat actors are forced to have macOS malware tools. We believe that in the future\n\nLazarus is going to support all platforms that software developers are using as a base platform, because\n\ncompromising developers opens many doors at once.\n\n\n-----\n\npush malware through an update mechanism. However, the multiple successful Lazarus attempts to\n\ncompromise supply chain companies suggest that it will keep exploring this infection method. From all\n\nangles, the Celas LLC story looks like the threat actor has found an elaborate way to create a legitimate\n\nlooking business and inject a malicious payload into a “legitimate looking” software update mechanism.\n\nSounds logical: if one cannot compromise a supply chain, why not to make fake one?\n\nThis should be a lesson to all of us and a wake-up call to businesses relying on third-party software. Do not\n\nautomatically trust the code running on your systems. Neither good looking website, nor solid company\n\nprofile nor the digital certificates guarantee the absence of backdoors. Trust has to be earned and proven.\n\nStay safe!\n\n## Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n\n### File Hashes (malicious documents, trojans, emails, decoys)\n\nTronized installer and payload\n\n9e740241ca2acdc79f30ad2c3f50990a celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi\n\n4126e1f34cf282c354e17587bb6e8da3 celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi\n\n0bdb652bbe15942e866083f29fb6dd62 CelasTradePro-Installer.msi\n\n48ded52752de9f9b73c6bf9ae81cb429 celastradepro_mac_installer_1.00.00.dmg\n\nb054a7382adf6b774b15f52d971f3799 Updater.exe\n\nffae703a1e327380d85880b9037a0aeb Updater.exe\n\nbbbcf6da5a4c352e8846bf91c3358d5c Updater.exe\n\n0a15a33844c9df11f12a4889ae7b7e4b msn.exe\n\nE1ed584a672cab33af29114576ad6cce uploadmgrsvc.dll\n\nD8484469587756ce0d10a09027044808 uploadmgr.dat\n\nD7089e6bc8bd137a7241a7ad297f975d\n\n\n-----\n\n81c3a3c5a0129477b59397173fdc0b01\n\n6cb34af551b3fb63df6c9b86900cf044\n\n21694c8db6234df74102e8b5994b7627\n\n5ad7d35f0617595f26d565a3b7ebc6d0\n\nc501ea6c56ba9133c3c26a7d5ed4ce49\n\ncafda7b3e9a4f86d4bd005075040a712\n\ncea1a63656fb199dd5ab90528188e87c\n\n6b061267c7ddeb160368128a933d38be\n\n56f5088f488e50999ee6cced1f5dd6aa\n\ncd6796f324ecb7cf34bc9bc38ce4e649\n\nSame C&C server Fallchill\n\n94dfcabd8ba5ca94828cd5a88d6ed488\n\n14b6d24873f19332701177208f85e776\n\nabec84286df80704b823e698199d89f7\n\n### File path\n\nC:\\Recovery\\msn.exe\n\nC:\\Recovery\\msndll.log\n\nC:\\Windows\\msn.exe\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\uploadmgrsvc.dll\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\uploadmgr.dat\n\n### Domains and IPs\n\nwww.celasllc[.]com/checkupdate.php (malware distribution URL)\n\n\n-----\n\n80.82.64[.]91\n\n185.142.239[.]173\n\n[APPLE MACOS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=113) [CRYPTOCURRENCIES](https://securelist.com/all?tag=683) [FINANCIAL MALWARE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=561) [LAZARUS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=867)\n\n[MALWARE DESCRIPTIONS](https://securelist.com/all?tag=123) [SPEAR PHISHING](https://securelist.com/all?tag=200) [TROJAN](https://securelist.com/all?tag=544)\n\n### Related Posts\n\n###### Dark Tequila Añejo Spam and phishing in Q2 2018\n\n\nShare post on:\n\n####   \n\n\n###### KeyPass ransomware\n\n\n-----",
