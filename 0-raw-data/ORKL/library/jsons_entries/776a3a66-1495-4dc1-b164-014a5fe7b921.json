But an investigation by one Taiwanese\nsecurity firm has revealed just how deeply a single group of Chinese hackers was able to\npenetrate an industry at the core of the Taiwanese economy, pillaging practically its entire\nsemiconductor industry.\n\nAt the Black Hat security conference today, researchers from the Taiwanese cybersecurity\nfirm CyCraft plan to present new details of a hacking campaign that compromised at least\nseven Taiwanese chip firms over the past two years. The series of deep intrusions—called\nOperation Skeleton Key due to the attackers' use of a \"skeleton key injector\" technique—\nappeared aimed at stealing as much intellectual property as possible, including source code,\nsoftware development kits, and chip designs. And while CyCraft has previously given this\ngroup of hackers the name Chimera, the company's new findings include evidence that ties\nthem to mainland China and loosely links them to the notorious Chinese state-sponsored\nhacker group Winnti, also sometimes known as Barium, or Axiom.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is very much a state-based attack trying to manipulate Taiwan s standing and power,\nsays Chad Duffy, one of the CyCraft researchers who worked on the company's long-running\ninvestigation. The sort of wholesale theft of intellectual property CyCraft observed\n\"fundamentally damages a corporation's entire ability to do business,\" adds Chung-Kuan\nChen, another CyCraft researcher who will present the company's research at Black Hat\ntoday. \"It's a strategic attack on the entire industry.\"\n\nSkeleton Key\n\nThe CyCraft researchers declined to tell WIRED the names of any victim companies. Some\nwere CyCraft customers, while the firm analyzed other intrusions in cooperation with an\ninvestigative group known as the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams. Several\nof the semiconductor company victims were headquartered at the Hsinchu Industrial Park, a\ntechnology hub in the Northwest Taiwanese city of Hsinchu.\n\nThe researchers found that in at least some cases, the hackers appeared to gain initial\naccess to victim networks by compromising virtual private networks, though it wasn't clear if\nthey obtained credentials for that VPN access or if they directly exploited vulnerabilities in the\nVPN servers. The hackers then typically used a customized version of the penetration testing\ntool Cobalt Strike, disguising the malware they planted by giving it the same name as a\nGoogle Chrome update file. They also used a command-and-control server hosted on\nGoogle's or Microsoft's cloud services, making its communications harder to detect as\nanomalous.\n\nFrom their initial access points, the hackers would attempt to move to other machines on the\n[network by accessing databases of passwords protected with cryptographic hashing and](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hacker-lexicon-password-hashing/)\nattempting to crack them. Whenever possible, CyCraft's analyst say, the hackers used stolen\ncredentials and legitimate features available to users to move through the network and gain\nfurther access, rather than infect machines with malware that might reveal their fingerprints.\n\nThe most distinctive tactic that CyCraft found the hackers using repeatedly in victim\nnetworks, however, was a technique to manipulate domain controllers, the powerful servers\nthat set the rules for access in large networks. With a custom-built program that combined\ncode from the common hacking tools Dumpert and Mimikatz, the hackers would add a new,\nadditional password for every user in the domain controller's memory—the same one for\neach user—a trick known as skeleton key injection. With that new password the hackers\nwould have surreptitious access to machines across the company. \"It's like a skeleton key\nthat lets them go anywhere,\" Duffy says\n\nChina Ties\n\nCyCraft quietly [published most of these findings about Operation Skeleton Key in April of this](https://cycraft.com/download/%5BTLP-White%5D20200415%20Chimera_V4.1.pdf)\nyear. But in its Black Hat talk, it plans to add several new findings that help to tie the hacking\ncampaign to mainland China.\n\n\n-----\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable of those new clues came from essentially hacking the hackers.\nCyCraft researchers observed the Chimera group exfiltrating data from a victim's network\nand were able to intercept a authentication token from their communications to a commandand-control server. Using that same token, CyCraft's analysts were able browse the contents\nof the cloud server, which included what they describe as a \"cheat sheet\" for the hackers,\noutlining their standard operating procedure for typical intrusions. That document was\nnotably written in simplified Chinese characters, used in mainland China but not Taiwan.\n\nThe hackers also appeared to operate largely within Beijing's time zone, to follow a \"996\"\nwork schedule—the 9am to 9pm, six-days-a-week regimen common in the Chinese tech\nindustry—and to take off Mainland Chinese holidays. Finally, CyCraft says they've learned\nfrom their cooperation with Taiwanese and foreign intelligence agencies that a hacker group\nusing similar techniques also targeted Taiwanese government agencies.\n\nMost specifically revealing, though, was the presence of one backdoor program on multiple\nvictims' networks that CyCraft says was previously used by the Winnti group, a large\ncollection of hackers who have operated for over a decade and who are widely believed to\nbe based in mainland China. In recent years, Winnti has become known for carrying out a\nmix of what appears to be state-sponsored hacking aligned with China's interests and forprofit criminal hacking, often targeting videogame firms. In 2015, Symantec found that Winnti\n[also appeared to be using skeleton key injection attacks like the kind CyCraft found used](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=db56700d-bb0b-4ae7-9574-cc6e44c0dec3&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nagainst the Taiwanese semiconductor companies. (CyCraft notes that it's still not certain that\nChimera is in fact Winnti, but considers it a likely possibility.)\n\nKaspersky, which first spotted and named the Winnti group in an investigation published in\n2013, last year linked the group to an attack that hijacked the update mechanism for\ncomputers sold by Taiwan-based Asus. Costin Raiu, the director of Kaspersky's Global\nResearch & Analysis Team, says Winnti is responsible for other attacks on a broad range of\nTaiwanese companies beyond the semiconductor makers CyCraft has focused on, from\ntelecoms to tech firms.\n\n\"It's possible that what they’re seeing is just a small fragment of a larger picture,\" Raiu says.\nWinnti isn't unique among China-linked groups in their widespread targeting of Taiwan, Raiu\nadds. But he says Winnti's innovative tactics, like the hijacking of Asus's software updates,\nset them apart.\n\nEven amidst China's wholesale hacking of its island neighbor, though, CyCraft's Duffy argues\nthat the semiconductor industry represents a particularly dangerous target. Stealing chip\nschematics, he points out, could potentially allow Chinese hackers to more easily dig up\nvulnerabilities hidden in computing hardware. \"If you have a really deep understanding of\nthese chips at a schematic level, you can run all sorts of simulated attacks on them and find\nvulnerabilities before they even get released,\" Duffy says. \"By the time the devices hit the\nmarket, they're already compromised.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nCyCraft concedes it can t determine what the hackers are doing with the stolen chip design\ndocuments and code. And the more likely motivation of the hacking campaign is simply to\ngive China's own semiconductor makers a leg up over their rivals. \"This is a way to cripple a\npart of Taiwan's economy, to hurt their long-term viability,\" Duffy says. \"If you look at the\nscope of this attack, pretty much the entire industry, up and down the supply chain, it seems\nlike it's about trying to shift the power relationship there. If all the intellectual property is in\nChina's hands, they have a lot more power.\"\n\n**_Correction 8/7/2020 10:30 AM EST: This story has been updated to more accurately_**\n_explain the skeleton key injection technique._\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n[There’s no such thing as family secrets in the age of 23andMe](https://www.wired.com/story/theres-no-such-thing-as-family-secrets-in-the-age-of-23andme/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nMy friend was struck by ALS.
