Its stealthiness comes from its advanced communication\nfeatures, which mix its data exchange with regular internet traffic.\n\n\"Daxin is, without doubt, the most advanced piece of malware Symantec researchers have\nseen used by a China-linked actor,\" Symantec said in a new report.\n\n\"Considering its capabilities and the nature of its deployed attacks, Daxin appears to be\noptimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the attackers to burrow deep into a\ntarget’s network and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions.\"\n\n## Hiding in legitimate network traffic\n\nBackdoors provide threat actors with remote access to a compromised computer system,\nallowing them to steal data, execute commands, or download and install further malware.\n\nBecause these tools are typically used to steal information from protected networks or\nfurther compromise a device, they need to involve some form of data transfer encryption or\nobfuscation to evade raising alarms on network traffic monitoring tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nDaxin does this by monitoring network traffic on a device for specific patterns. Once these\npatterns are detected, it will hijack the legitimate TCP connection and use it to communicate\nwith the command and control server.\n\nBy hijacking TCP communications, the Daxin malware can hide malicious communication in\nwhat is perceived as legitimate traffic and thus remain undetected.\n\n\"Daxin’s use of hijacked TCP connections affords a high degree of stealth to its\ncommunications and helps to establish connectivity on networks with strict firewall rules. It\nmay also lower the risk of discovery by SOC analysts monitoring for network anomalies,\"\n[explains the report by Symantec.](http://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/daxin-backdoor-espionage)\n\nThis essentially opens an encrypted communication channel for transmitting or stealing\ndata, all done through a seemingly innocuous TCP tunnel.\n\n“Daxin’s built-in functionality can be augmented by deploying additional components on the\ninfected computer. Daxin provides a dedicated communication mechanism for such\ncomponents by implementing a device named \\\\.\\Tcp4,” further explained Symantec.\n\n“The malicious components can open this device to register themselves for communication.\nEach of the components can associate a 32-bit service identifier with the opened \\\\.\\Tcp4\nhandle. The remote attacker is then able to communicate with selected components by\nspecifying a matching service identified when sending messages of a certain type.”\n\nDaxin also stands out due to its capability to establish intricate communication pathways\nacross multiple infected computers at once, using a single command to a set of nodes.\n\n**Daxin establishing communication channels on compromised networks** _(Symantec)_\nThis allows the threat actors to quickly re-establish connections and encrypted\ncommunication channels in well-guarded networks\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the same time, while the nodes are active and serve as relay points, the chances of the\nmalicious traffic being marked as suspicious are kept at a minimum.\n\n## Chinese cyber-espionage\n\nSymantec's threat analysts have found evidence linking Daxin to the Chinese state-backed\n[hacking group Slug (aka Owlproxy).](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/more-hacking-groups-join-microsoft-exchange-attack-frenzy/)\n\nReportedly, the particular backdoor has been actively used in attacks since at least\nNovember 2019, while researchers spotted signs of its deployment again in May 2020 and\nJuly 2020.\n\nThe most recent attacks involving Daxin were observed in November 2021, targeting\ntelecommunication, transportation, and manufacturing companies.\n\nIt's worth noting that Symantec claims the malware was first sampled back in 2013, already\nfeaturing the advanced detection-avoidance techniques that we see in today's version.\n\nHowever, no attacks that involved Daxin were observed until later, even though it's likely\nthat the stealthy hackers simply remained undetected until 2019.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BPFDoor: Stealthy Linux malware bypasses firewalls for remote access](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-stealthy-linux-malware-bypasses-firewalls-for-remote-access/)\n\n[Chinese hackers abuse VLC Media Player to launch malware loader](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-abuse-vlc-media-player-to-launch-malware-loader/)\n\n[Backdoor baked into premium school management plugin for WordPress](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/backdoor-baked-into-premium-school-management-plugin-for-wordpress/)\n\n[New ChromeLoader malware surge threatens browsers worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chromeloader-malware-surge-threatens-browsers-worldwide/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[Backdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[China](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/china/)\n[Daxin](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/daxin/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
