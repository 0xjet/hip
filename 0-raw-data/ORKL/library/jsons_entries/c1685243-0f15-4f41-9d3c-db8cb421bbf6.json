    "plain_text": "# Lazarus Targets Latin American Financial Companies\n\n**blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/lazarus-continues-heists-mounts-attacks-on-financial-**\norganizations-in-latin-america/\n\nNovember 20, 2018\n\nThe cybercriminal group Lazarus, and particularly its subgroup Bluenoroff, has a history of\nattacking financial organizations in Asia and Latin America. There seems to be a resurgence\nof activity from the group, and recent events show how their tools and techniques have\n[evolved. Just last week they were found stealing millions from ATMs across Asia and Africa.](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075124/north-korea-lazarus-atm-fastcash-hack-millions-dollars-stolen)\nWe also recently discovered that they successfully planted their backdoor (detected by Trend\nMicro as [BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) into several machines of financial institutions across](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/bkdr_binlodr.znfj-a)\nLatin America.\n\nWe determined that these backdoors were installed on the targets’ machines on September\n19 2018, based mainly on the service creation time of the loader component. We also saw\nthat the attack technique bears some resemblance to a previous 2017 Lazarus attack,\n[analyzed by BAE Systems, against targets in Asia. The use of FileTokenBroker.dll was a key](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2017/10/taiwan-heist-lazarus-tools.html)\npart of the group’s attack in 2017, and they seem to have used the same modularized\nbackdoor in the recent incident as well.\n\nOur analysis of the backdoors used in the September 2018 attacks show that\nAuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll was similarly used:\n\n\n**FileTokenBroker.dll**\n**(2017 attack)**\n\n\n**AuditCred.dll/Roptimizer.dll**\n**(2018 attack)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Launch Method** Service Service\n\n**Function** Loader Component Loader Component\n\n**Working directory** %Windows%\\System32 %Windows%\\System32\n\n\n**Loaded Component**\n**Path**\n\n**Loaded Component**\n**Blending**\n\n\n%Windows%\\System32\\enUS\n\n\nBlends with .mui files Blend with ActiveX data Object dll\nfiles\n\n\n%Program Files%\\Common\nFiles\\System\\ado\n\n\n_Table1: Similarities of the Loader components in both incidents_\n\n**Analysis of backdoors used in 2018**\n\nThe Lazarus group used a series of backdoors in their 2018 attacks, employing a\ncomplicated technique that involves three major components:\n\n**AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A)**\n– loader DLL that is launched as a service\n**Msadoz<n>.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR64_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted**\nbackdoor; n = number of characters in the loader dll’s filename\n**Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui (detected by Trend Micro as**\nTROJ_BINLODRCONF.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted configuration file\n\n_Figure 1: Loading sequence of the modularized backdoor_\n\nThe loader DLL is installed as a service and uses different names (AuditCred and\nROptimizer) on different machines. However, they still have the same capabilities and are\nessentially the same file. Its purpose is to load Msadoz<n>.dll in order to decrypt and\nexecute it in memory.\n\n**[Figure 2](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/11/lazaruslatinamerica2.png)**\n\n_Figure 2: AuditCred/ROptimizer Service_\n\nIf successfully installed, this particular backdoor poses quite a threat to its target. It is\ncapable of the following functions:\n\n**Collect file/folder/drive information**\n**Download files and additional malware**\n**Launch/terminate/enumerate process**\n**Update configuration data**\n**Delete files**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Inject code from files to other running process**\n**Utilize proxy**\n**Open reverse shell**\n**Run in passive mode — instead of actively connecting to the command and**\n**control (C&C) server, the backdoor will open and listen to a port then receive**\n**commands through it**\n\nOnce the backdoor is loaded, it will then load the encrypted configuration file\nAuditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui to extract the C&C information and connect to it. The\nconnection is necessary for conducting activities; and based on the backdoor's functions,\nthese actions could be quite damaging to targets.\n\n**[Figure 3](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/11/lazaruslatinamerica3.png)**\n\n**_Figure 3: The first step of decryption will perform XOR on one byte using the previous_**\n**_adjacent byte, starting from the last byte and excluding the first byte_**\n\n**[Figure 4](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/11/lazaruslatinamerica4.png)**\n\n**_Figure 4: The second step uses RC4, using the first 0x20 bytes from the result of the_**\n**_first step as the RC4 key_**\n\n[Figure 5](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/11/lazaruslatinamerica5.png)\n\n_Figure 5: Encrypted (Top) and decrypted (bottom) configuration file_\n\nIt is also important to note that while the loader component and the configuration file are\nlocated in the same directory (%windows%\\system32), the encrypted backdoor is located in\na different directory (%Program Files%\\Common Files\\System\\ado). This complex setup\nmakes it harder to detect and remove all the backdoors, and is more effective at hiding any\nactivities.\nThe complexity and the capabilities of these backdoors present a tough problem for the\ntargeted organizations. It is a sophisticated attack that needs equally sophisticated security\nsolutions.\n\nTrend Micro Solutions\n\nThe Lazarus group is an experienced organization, methodically evolving their tools and\nexperimenting with strategies to get past an organization’s defenses. The backdoors they are\ndeploying are difficult to detect and a significant threat to the privacy and security of\nenterprises, allowing attackers to steal information, delete files, install malware, and more.\n\nThese and other tools used by the Lazarus group can be mitigated by routinely scanning the\nnetwork for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and spreading\nthrough an organization. In addition, educating employees and other key people in an\n\n\n-----\n\n[organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look out for](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/keep-an-eye-out-for-these-social-engineering-scams)\nwhen it comes to malicious attacks.\n\nOther mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s\n[perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help](http://blog.trendmicro.com/ensuring-comprehensive-endpoint-security/)\nprevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.\n\n[Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps.html) WorryFree™ Business Security can protect users and businesses from these threats by detecting\nmalicious files and spammed messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs.\n[Trend Micro Deep Discovery™ has an email inspection layer that can protect enterprises by](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network/advanced-threat-protection.html)\ndetecting malicious attachments and URLs that could lead to malicious downloads.\n\n[Trend Micro XGen™ security provides a cross-generational blend of threat defense](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/all-solutions.html)\ntechniques to protect systems from all types of threats.
