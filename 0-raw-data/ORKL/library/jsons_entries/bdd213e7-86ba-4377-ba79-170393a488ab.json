As part of this\nongoing effort, we recently discovered a new targeted attack we believe is compelling for four main reasons:\n\n1. It appears to target Farsi-speaking code developers by using a Microsoft Word document that includes a Microsoft Dynamic Data\n\nExchange (DDE) exploit.\n2. It leverages a previously undiscovered remote access trojan (RAT)—dubbed CodeRAT by SafeBreach Labs researchers—that supports\n\n~50 commands.\n3. We were able to identify the developer of CodeRAT who, after being confronted by us, decided to publish the source code of CodeRAT\n\nin his public GitHub account.\n4. CodeRAT is using a unique exfiltration and command and control mechanism. Instead of using a dedicated C2 server, CodeRAT is\n\nusing a public anonymous file upload API.\n\nIn this research report, we will provide a high-level overview of CodeRAT, including when it first appeared, what it does, the type of\ncommunications it uses, and who might be behind it. We’ll also provide a deep-dive into the technical details behind the RAT, including its\noperational modes and available commands. Finally, we’ll provide insight into our conversation with the developer of CodeRAT and details\nabout how SafeBreach is sharing this information with the security community.\n\n## CodeRAT Overview\n\n[For initial access, the threat actor uses a Microsoft Word document that includes a DDE exploit, a well-known technique used by threat actors](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/malware-embedded-microsoft-office-documents-dde-exploit-macroless/)\nto deliver malicious code within a macro in the document. The document used in this attack contains information regarding hardware design\nlanguages ​​like Verilog and very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language (VHDL).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Sample of content in Word document used in attack_\n\n[The file, named 432gsbse5, was first uploaded to the alberfrancis GitHub repository on April 22, 2022—the exploit downloads and executes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alberfrancis/camo/main/432gsbse5)\nCodeRAT from this repository. The file was updated on July 10, 2022, and subsequently deleted and uploaded again 15 times by the threat\nactor.\n\n_Figure 2: The albertfrancis GitHub repository, including two versions of the RAT and two libraries_\n\nThis exploits document was first submitted to VirusTotal from Iran on July 5, 2022.\n\n_Figure 3: VirusTotal submission_\n\nOnce executed, the main goal of CodeRAT is to monitor the victim’s activity on social networks and on local machines. The monitoring\ncapabilities include almost 50 commands and allow the attacker to monitor webmail, Microsoft Office documents, databases, social networks,\n[games integrated development environments (IDEs) for Windows and Android and pornographic sites Moreover CodeRAT monitors a large](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/integrated-development-environment#:~:text=An%20IDE%20typically%20contains%20a,is%20executable%20for%20a%20computer.)\n\n\n-----\n\nu be o b o se do t t es, t o o c a e u que to a a ct s a popu a a a e co e ce s te a d a eb esse ge\nFarsi.\n\nThis type of monitoring—specifically of pornographic sites, use of anonymous browsing tools, and social network activities—leads us to\nbelieve CodeRAT is an intelligence tool used by a threat actor tied to a government. It is commonly seen in attacks operated by the Islamic\nregime of Iran to monitor illegal/immoral activities of their citizens.\n\nThe communication methods of CodeRAT are versatile and quite unique. CodeRAT supports communication over Telegram groups using the\nbot API or through USB flash drive. It can also act in silent mode, which includes no report back. CodeRAT uses an anonymous, public\nuploading site, rather than a dedicated C2 server, and uses anti-detection techniques to limit its usage to 30 days. In addition, it will use the\nHTTP Debugger website as a proxy to communicate with its C2 Telegram group.\n\n## CodeRAT Detailed Analysis\n\n**Operation Modes**\n\nCodeRAT has five modes of operation derived from a command line argument:\n\n1. “father” – Get a process ID (PID) from a second command line argument, then kill it and start it with the “continue” command line\n\nargument.\n2. “Continue” – Get a PID from a second command line argument, then kill it and delete its .exe, .pdb, and .exe.config files.\n3. “Word” – Check if the last modified date of the RAT binary is below 30 days.\n\n_Figure 4: Compile time anti-detection technique_\n\nIt will copy itself to %appdata%\\desktopmgr.exe. If it fails to copy, it will copy itself to myPictures\\deskmgr.exe. If the copy works, it will\nexecute it with the “Wordbetraied” argument (below) and its own working directory path as a second argument.\n\n1. “Wordbetraied” – Download Aspose.Words.dll from the same GitHub repository and check if a file pass.exe exists in the directory\n\nreceived in the second command line argument.\n\n1. If the pass.exe file does not exist, it will try to delete files received in second and third arguments.\n2. If the pass.exe file exists, it will search all the .docx files in his current directory. For each .docx file, it will rename it to\n\n_[working.docx and will use the LoadOptions class exported by the Aspose.Words.dll to load the document into a Document object](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document)_\nand set a password from the pass.txt file on the document. Next, it will search the winword process by enumerating all processes\nand searching for a process with a Window title that contains the name of the .docx file. It will delete the .docx file and save the\nobject with the password to a new file. Then it will terminate the winword process and start the new Word with the password file.\n\n2. If none of the four command arguments was used, it will execute a file with the same name but that ends with .exe.bak.\n\nCodeRAT generates a unique ID for each victim with this formula:\n\n_from cpu_id(13) + cpu_id(1,4) + the hard drive volume serial number + cpu_id(4)_\n\n**Commands**\n\nCommands can be received in three methods:\n\n1. Local file – CodeRAT will check if the file command.txt exists under myPictures folder. The content should end with “EOF”.\n\nIf it exists, it will read the last command before “EOF”. If it’s equal to “silence”, it won’t report back; if it’s not silent, it will use the\nusbFlash to report.\n\nSupported USB commands are: flashextentioncopy, flashcopyfilelist, flashcopyfolderlist (see details in the next section).\n2. Manual UI – CodeRAT will get the command from the main UI window (see details in the next section) and use usbFlash to report back\n\nby copying the exfiltrated data to the USB. The USB drive letter will be received from a combobox in the UI. There are two buttons: one\nwill hide the UI and one doesn’t hide it.\n3. Telegram bot API – CodeRAT will use getUpdates Telegram bot API to get messages/commands and for exfiltration. An interesting\n\nfeature is that it uses a proxy instead of directly querying the Telegram bot API. The proxy used is: [www.httpdebugger.com](http://www.httpdebugger.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: HTTP Debugger used as a proxy_\n\nCodeRAT parses the HTML response of the HTTP Debugger proxy and extracts the original response of the Telegram bot API:\n\n_<h3 class=’ls1 t400 h2long’>Response Content</h3><pre class=’brush: html; toolbar: false; wrap-lines: true;’>{“ok”:true,”result”:[]}</pre>_\n\nEach message will be between brackets and contain at least one “-”, which is the separator between messages.\nIf the message is the MD5 of * or includes the unique ID of the attackers machine, it will upload files, screen captures, and thumbnail images\n[using the public anonymous file upload API: https://api.anonfile.com/upload](https://api.anonfile.com/upload)\n\n_Figure 6: Anonymous file upload example_\n\n_Figure 7: Anonymous file upload example continued_\n\nThen it will send the URL to download the files to the Telegram group using the Telegram bot API.\n\n_Figure 8: Anonymous files upload example_\n\n_Figure 9: URL to download the file_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Code** **boss** **ode**\n\nCodeRAT will check for “boss” mode every two seconds.\n\n_Figure 10: BossWatch calls CheckBoss function_\n\nIf a file boss.txt exists under the myPictures folder and the MD5 of the data in that file is equal to “2A47E576EB06CA284E7B3D92A0412923”,\nit will unhide the main window or show the main window and allocate a new main form.\n\n_Figure 11: CheckBoss function unhides the main form window_\n\nThis mainForm is the main window that supports manual operation of CodeRAT functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12: CodeRAT main form_\n\nCodeRAT includes a second hidden UI form; it will run its logic in a thread if “data” and “zn” directories both exist in the working current\ndirectory.\n\n_Figure 13: CodeRAT ZipExtractor form – only reads files, does not extract them_\n\nThe code checks if the location is: “bossmohsen”. Mohsen is a popular Persian name and is probably the private name of one of the attackers\nnicknamed the “boss”. CodeRAT’s default folder is under %appdata%\\”Desktop Windows Manager”.\n\nCodeRAT includes an unused encryption password: “S14vahsh1@123”\n\nIt seems to include the obfuscated name Siavahsh. We found different accounts using this name on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, but we\ncan’t guarantee it belongs to the attackers.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nThere were a variety of clues that the threat actor was targeting Iranian victims who are developers, including:\n\nThe malicious Word document contains content in the Farsi language.\n[The monitoring of the sensitive window named Digikala, which is an Iranian e-commerce company based in Tehran. It has 30 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce)\n[visitors per month and is ranked by Alexa as Iran’s third-most visited website.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Internet)\nThe other sensitive windows being monitored, such as Visual Studio, Python, PhpStorm, and Verilog, also strongly imply the targets are\ncode developers.\nThere are indications that the attackers’ names may be Mohsen and Siavahsh, which are common Persian names.\n\nIn order to dig deeper we used the bot API getMe and discovered that the bot name was HellChainBot\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: getMe bot API result: HellChainBog_\n\nWe then used the bot API getChat and discovered that the user name of the attacker’s Telegram group was Mr Moded, with the bio of\n“Member of emptiness”.\n\n_Figure 15: Telegram getChat bot API result: Mr Moded_\n\nWe were then able to find this GitHub by Mr Moded, which includes a RoboThief Telegram session stealer.\n\n_Figure 16: Mr Moded GitHub repository – RoboThief_\n\n[The Telegram channel https://t.me/MrModedProduct includes the same user name and bio. The image returned by the getChat API query is](https://t.me/MrModedProduct)\nalso the same image used in the attacker’s Telegram bot.\n\n_Figure 17: Telegram getChat bot API result: Mr Moded_\n\nBelow, we’ve included the Mr Moded GitHub repository. At that time of our research, it included only the RoboThief source code.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: Mr Moded GitHub repository with RoboThief source code_\n\nNext, we found a publication from 2020 by a security researcher named Rico Jambor, who analyzed two attacks using RoboThief. Mr Moded,\nthe developer of RoboThief, contacted Jambor and asked that a clarification be added to the blog that he was not behind the past attack, but\nrather just a developer of the code.\n\n_Figure 19: Jambor’s blog post from 2020 regarding RoboThief attacks_\n\nBelow are the messages from Mr Moded to Jambor on this topic from 2020:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20: Conversation from 2020 between Jambor & Mr Moded_\n\n_Figure 21: Conversation from 2020 between Jambor & Mr Moded Continued_\n\nIn August 2022, we contacted Jambor and decided to confront Mr Moded again about the CodeRAT attacks. In the conversation, Mr Moded\ndidn’t deny the allegation, but instead requested more information about it.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22: Conversation from August 2022 between Jambor & Mr Moded_\n\n_Figure 23: Conversation from August 2022 between Jambor & Mr Moded Continued_\n\nAfter we provided Mr Moded proof that he was behind the development of the code, he published the source code on his GitHub account,\nproving we were correct and that he was indeed the developer of CodeRAT.\n\nThe code repository is under:\n\n[https://github.com/MrModed/DWM](https://github.com/MrModed/DWM)\n\n\n-----\n\ne o s t e desc pt o oded p o ded o Code t e de e op e t sou ce code, c deta s o t s d e e t t a e st g\nRATs:\n\n⭕ Most powerful TELEGRAM RAT, USB RAT ⭕\n\nWhat’s the difference with other RATS?\n\nHuge list of commands\nIn development source\nOpen source\nANTI FILTER Ability\n\n**The New Published UI**\n\nThe UI below is used for generating a command for CodeRAT.

By sharing information specifically about our discovery of CodeRAT, our goal is to raise\nawareness about this new, unrecognized type of malware that leverages a relatively new technique of using an anonymous uploads site as a\nC2 server. We also hope to warn the developer community about the fact that they are particularly vulnerable to being targeted by this attack.\nFinally, we hope organizations and individuals can use the indicators of compromise (IOCs) and YARA rules provided in Appendix A to better\ndetect and protect themselves against this threat.\n\nAs with any newly identified threat, SafeBreach has added coverage for CodeRAT to the [SafeBreach platform, so customers can immediately](https://www.safebreach.com/our-platform/)\nsimulate this attack, verify whether they are adequately protected, and take any necessary remedial action.\n\n## Appendix A: IOCs list\n\n**Docx**\n\n\n-----\n\n5d6 ccc8 ec3c3c6 86dcaa5d9 69 0b 69 5 50 ee 0 59b 35cd c55 b\nParsian – about hardware design languages ​​like Verilog and VHDL.\n\n**Contains XML file with DDE exploit 2a4e5e6f403ce913cb073d5c5d1fd999d8ae79deb04915b9777525e05e21a2b2**\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/alberfrancis/camo/main/432gsbse5\n\n**432gsbse5 – current version of CodeRAT**\n\nCD53FBA6DDD4AE4EF7A5747C6003236C85791477854CC1B7CE00E0F8EE7677D9\n\n**2.exe – another version of CodeRAT from April 2022**\n\nF22041B2EA1FD6D8E7F6F1DB7469DEC61B000D067AB4BE2C5B0654EDFECBDDB6\n\nhttps://api.telegram.org/bot5379338428:AAFkD8lIvAK1pvUDQYu-siFHUOxo7JlaziQ/getchat?chat_id=968019073\n\nhttps://api.telegram.org/bot1335021029:AAHbdgFSOPJ5KtcF1YMdtsN2jc7Yqu6Tou8/getchat?chat_id=968019073\n\n**YARA**\n\nrule CodeRAT\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\nsource = “SafeBreach.com”\n\ndate = “2022-08-23”\n\ndescription = “Detects CodeRAT binary”\n\nstrings:\n\n$interesting_string0 = “2A47E576EB06CA284E7B3D92A0412923”\n\n$interesting_string1 = “httpdebugger.com”\n\n$interesting_string2 = “wordbetraied”\n\n$interesting_string3 = “Newtonsoft.Json.dll”\n\n$interesting_string4 = “working.docx”\n\n$interesting_string5 = “wifipasswords”\n\n$interesting_string6 = “pass.txt”\n\n$interesting_string7 = “boss.txt”\n\n$interesting_string8 = “command.txt”\n\ncondition:\n\nall of ($interesting_*)\n\n}\n\n## Appendix B: Sensitive Windows Title List to Monitor\n\nCodeRAT’s main goal is to monitor the victim’s activity on social networks and on their machine.
