Additionally, Gu Jian appeared to manage a\nnetwork security competition at the university and was reportedly seeking novel ways of\ncracking passwords, offering large amounts of money to those able to do so. The registered\naddress for Hainan Xiandun is the Hainan University Library.\n\nOur analysts and contributors were reassured to know that this blog is not alone in being\nsuspicious of these Hainan front companies. Questions abound online about why these\ncompanies have such a thin presence on the Internet or, as below, whether the jobs they are\npromoting even exist.\n\nThis Chinese post is titled “Hainan Yili Technology Company: How can you find this company\non the Internet, can I trust this job advert?” and asks other users of the site for their views.\n\n\n-----\n\nFortunately, this blog has been able to identify a number of individuals who have worked at\none of these front companies. None of these leads are ground-breaking (check back\ntomorrow for that), but perhaps these individuals will provide other investigators with\ninteresting leads to follow in the future.\n\n**Mr Wu**\n\nWu Bingnan (吴炳南) worked as a translator for Hainan Xiandun from 2015-2016. An English\nspeaker who also specialised in project management. Where did he study? Hainan\nUniversity…\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Ms Guo**\n\nGuo Kua (郭跨), also known as ‘Sugar’, is a former Vietnamese translator at Hainan Kehua.\nAs we have seen so often for these companies, Sugar doesn’t provide much detail about her\nrole or responsibilities.\n\n**Mr Cai**\n\nCai Shiping (蔡世平) is a Project Manager at Hainan Tengyuan.\n\n**Mr Hou**\n\nHou Guorong (候国荣) is an Information Security Engineer at Hainan Kehua.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mr Lü**\n\nLü Bizhen (吕碧桢) is an engineer at Hainan Kehua.\n\n**In summary: the Hainan front companies that this blog identified have been viewed**\n**with suspicion online by Chinese netizens and have a limited digital footprint. Despite**\n**the companies repeatedly describing themselves as having 50-100 employees, there**\n**is little information online about who they are. We have identified Wu Bingnan, Guo**\n**Kua, Hou Guorong, and Lü Bizhen as current or former workers at these companies.**\n\n\n-----",
