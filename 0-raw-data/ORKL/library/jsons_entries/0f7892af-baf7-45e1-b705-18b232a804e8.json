Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers link two HUI Loader\n[activity clusters exclusively to China-based threat groups. The BRONZE RIVERSIDE threat group](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-riverside)\nis likely responsible for one cluster, which focuses on stealing intellectual property from Japanese\norganizations. The other cluster involves deployment of LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and\nPandora post-intrusion ransomware. CTU™ researchers attribute this activity to the Chinese\n[BRONZE STARLIGHT threat group.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-starlight)\n\nThe victimology, short lifespan of each ransomware family, and access to malware used by\ngovernment-sponsored threat groups suggest that BRONZE STARLIGHT’s main motivation may be\nintellectual property theft or cyberespionage rather than financial gain. The ransomware could\ndistract incident responders from identifying the threat actors’ true intent and reduce the likelihood\nof attributing the malicious activity to a government-sponsored Chinese threat group.\n\n## HUI Loader overview\n\nHUI Loader is a custom DLL loader whose name is derived from a string in the loader (see Figure\n[1). The malware is loaded by legitimate programs that are vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\nHUI Loader decrypts and loads a third file containing an encrypted payload that is also deployed to\nthe compromised host. CTU researchers have observed HUI Loader loading RATs such as\nSodaMaster, PlugX, Cobalt Strike, and QuasarRAT.\n\n_Figure 1. String that starts with ‘HUI’ in HUI Loader samples. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nSince early 2021, CTU researchers observed threat actors deploying HUI Loader in a cluster of\n[activity associated with intellectual property theft. This A41APT campaign primarily targets](http://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2022/pdf/JSAC2022_9_yanagishita-tamada-nakatsuru-ishimaru_en.pdf)\nJapanese organizations and uses HUI Loader to load the SodaMaster RAT. The victimology and\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in this campaign align with BRONZE RIVERSIDE\nactivity. In mid-2021, CTU researchers began tracking a second cluster of activity that uses HUI\nLoader to load Cobalt Strike Beacon and deploy ransomware. CTU researchers attribute this\nsecond cluster of activity to the BRONZE STARLIGHT threat group. Figure 2 compares the clusters\nlinked to HUI Loader.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Diamond model comparing HUI Loader clusters.

HUI Loader and Cobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to ransomware activity._\n\nIn March 2022, CTU researchers analyzed an updated version of HUI Loader that uses the RC4\ncipher to decrypt the payload. The malware sample also attempts to circumvent host-based\n[detection and protection measures by disabling Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW),](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-)\n\n\n-----\n\n[disabling Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) functions, and hooking Windows API calls (see Figure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal)\n3). CTU researchers identified code overlap between the updated HUI Loader samples and the\nPandora ransomware.\n\n_Figure 3. Updated HUI Loader code that disables ETW. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Ransomware C2 infrastructure\n\nAnalysis of the Cobalt Strike Beacon samples loaded by HUI Loader revealed a link between\nAtomSilo, Night Sky, and Pandora ransomware. The Cobalt Strike Beacons were configured with\nan uncommon HTTP POST URI beginning with /rest/2/meetings and a watermark value of 0 (see\nFigure 4). As of this publication, CTU researchers have only observed this configuration in Cobalt\nStrike Beacons associated with these ransomware families.\n\n_Figure 4. Cobalt Strike payload configuration information. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration of these Cobalt Strike payloads is likely based on a modified version of a public\n[C2 malleable profile that configures the HTTP GET request URI as ‘/functionalstatus’ and the HTTP](https://github.com/xx0hcd/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/gotomeeting.profile)\nPOST URI as ‘/rest/2/meetings’.

Cobalt Strike Beacon sample configuration information linked to ransomware activity._\n\nIn a January 2022 Secureworks incident response (IR) engagement, CTU researchers observed a\nthreat actor compromising a ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus server. The threat actor exploited\n[an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-40539) and deployed a Meterpreter reverse shell](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40539)\nthat communicated with a C2 IP address (172 . 105 . 229 . 30). They then deployed three files to\nthe compromised host: a legitimate Microsoft Defender executable vulnerable to DLL search order\nhijacking, a HUI Loader sample (mpclient.dll) that is loaded by the executable, and an encrypted\nCobalt Strike Beacon (dlp.ini). CTU researchers did not observe follow-on activity.\n\nThe C2 server also hosted a legitimate VMware executable (VMwareXferlogs.exe) vulnerable to\nDLL search order hijacking. This executable loads a DLL (glib-2.0.dll) from the same directory. CTU\nresearchers were unable to obtain glib-2.0.dll from this C2 server but identified other glib-2.0.dll HUI\n[Loader samples that could be sideloaded by VMwareXferlogs.exe. An April 2022 third-party report](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/lockbit-ransomware-side-loads-cobalt-strike-beacon-with-legitimate-vmware-utility/)\nlinks glib-2.0.dll HUI Loader samples that load Cobalt Strike to LockBit ransomware. However,\nthere is not enough evidence in the report for CTU researchers to validate this claim.\n\nThe VirusTotal analysis service revealed URLs indicating the presence of glib-2.0.dll files on two\nservers (45 . 32 . 101 . 191 and 45 . 61 . 139 . 38). Passive DNS data shows that 45 . 61 . 139 . 38\n[hosted sc . microsofts . net, which is a C2 domain that third-party reporting links to LockFile](https://nsfocusglobal.com/insights-into-ransomware-spread-using-exchange-1-day-vulnerabilities-2-2/)\nransomware activity. The 45 . 32 . 101 . 191 IP address hosted api . openssl-digicert. xyz, which\nhas sibling domain (peek . openssl-digicert . xyz) that is linked to Pandora ransomware.\n\nWhile CTU researchers do not have access to these servers, timeline analysis suggests that two\nHUI Loader samples uploaded to VirusTotal may have been hosted on these servers. Both samples\nhave compile timestamps that are the close to the ‘URL first seen’ timestamp listed on VirusTotal\n(see Table 3). Although threat actors can trivially modify compile timestamps, the timeframe of the\n\n\n-----\n\nassociated intrusion activity makes it unlikely that these timestamps were altered. The two HUI\nLoader samples that were possibly hosted on these servers share code with the Pandora\nransomware.\n\n\n**Executable**\n**compile**\n**timestamp**\n\n22/01/2022\n18:16:45\n\n16/02/2022\n13:01:30\n\n\n**Server/URL likely**\n**associated with the**\n**sample**\n\nhttp: //45 . 61 . 139 .\n38/glib-2.0.dll\n\nhttp: //45 . 32 . 101 .\n191/glib-2.0.dll\n\n\n**URL first seen**\n**(VirusTotal)**\n\n25/01/2022\n14:01:35\n\n18/02/2022\n17:28:16\n\n\n**Sample**\n\nHUI\nLoader\nsample 1\n\nHUI\nLoader\nsample 2\n\n\n**First**\n**submission**\n**(VirusTotal)**\n\n24/01/2022\n08:15:29\n\n18/03/2022\n20:25:32\n\n\n_Table 3. HUI Loader samples likely hosted on servers linked to ransomware activity._\n\n### Ransomware TTPs and code overlap\n\nCTU analysis indicates that the five ransomware families linked to HUI Loader were developed\nfrom two distinct codebases: one for LockFile and AtomSilo, and the other for Rook, Night Sky, and\nPandora. Based on the order in which these ransomware families appeared starting in mid-2021,\nthe threat actors likely first developed LockFile and AtomSilo and then developed Rook, Night Sky,\nand Pandora.\n\n[Third-party researchers leveraged code overlap between LockFile and AtomSilo to release a](https://medium.com/s2wblog/atomsilo-x-lockfile-atomsilo-copied-blackmatter-and-cerber-for-operating-the-double-extortion-site-7fb5aaac5f21)\ndecryptor for files encrypted with these ransomware families in October 2021. Other third-party\n[reporting describes TTP overlap in LockFile and](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/lockfile-ransomware-new-petitpotam-windows) [AtomSilo intrusion activity. The overlap includes](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/10/04/atom-silo-ransomware-actors-use-confluence-exploit-dll-side-load-for-stealthy-attack/)\n[identical filenames for the ransomware executable and components of the Kernel Driver Utility.](https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU)\n\nTable 4 lists feature similarities across Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora. These ransomware families\n[appear to leverage the Babuk ransomware source code. The Babuk source code was reportedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomwares-full-source-code-leaked-on-hacker-forum/)\nleaked in September 2021, a few months before Rook operations began in December 2021.\n\n\n**Features** **Rook**\n\n\n**Night**\n**Sky** **Pandora**\n\n\nContains an embedded 2,048-bit RSA public key X X X\n\nCreates victim keys X X X\n\nUses a 2,048-bit RSA victim public key X X X\n\nEncrypts each file with a different key X X X\n\n\nAdds a file trailer containing information required for file\ndecryption\n\n[Uses a statically linked Mbed TLS library for encryption](https://tls.mbed.org/)\nfunctionality\n\n\nX X X\n\nX X X\n\n\n-----\n\n**Features** **Rook**\n\n\n**Night**\n**Sky** **Pandora**\n\n\nStores encryption keys in registry X X\n\nPartially encrypts large files and uses chunking X X X\n\n_Table 4. Similarities across Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora ransomware._\n\nThe use of HUI Loader to load Cobalt Strike Beacon, the Cobalt Strike Beacon configuration\ninformation, the C2 infrastructure, and the code overlap suggest that the same threat group is\nassociated with these five ransomware families. It is likely that BRONZE STARLIGHT is\nresponsible for LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora intrusion activity.\n\n## Connections to China\n\nAs of this publication, CTU researchers have not linked HUI Loader to publicly available code and\nhave only observed HUI Loader usage in the A41APT campaign linked to BRONZE RIVERSIDE\nand the post-intrusion ransomware activity linked to BRONZE STARLIGHT. BRONZE RIVERSIDE\n[(also known as APT10) is associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). A third-](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nparty report [attributes LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, and Night Sky ransomware activity to a Chinese](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/#Night%20Sky)\nthreat group it calls DEV-0401. The discovery of links to PlugX and Chinese-language resources\nassociated with the ransomware activity further support the likelihood that BRONZE STARLIGHT is\nbased in China.\n\nCTU analysis revealed four HUI Loader samples that decrypt and load PlugX RAT payloads. PlugX\nis used by multiple Chinese threat groups. One of the HUI Loader-linked PlugX samples\ncommunicates with hr . indiabullamc . com, which is a sibling domain of a BRONZE STARLIGHT\nCobalt Strike C2 domain (servers . indiabullamc . com). This Cobalt Strike Beacon sends HTTP\nGET requests to /static/js/siteanalyze_2392.js (see Figure 5). CTU researchers identified four\nadditional Cobalt Strike Beacons that send HTTP GET requests to the same URI. One of these\nCobalt Strike Beacons communicates with cs . microsofts . net, which is a sibling of a Cobalt Strike\nC2 domain (sc . microsofts . net) used by LockFile.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Configuration information for Cobalt Strike Beacon linked to PlugX sample. (Source:_\n_Secureworks)_\n\nThe indiabullamc . com domain likely masquerades as the legitimate website for an India-based\ncompany. A ransomware note uploaded to VirusTotal suggests that a company with a similar name\nwas a LockFile victim in July 2021. Analysis of the indiabullamc . com PlugX payload revealed that\nit replaces the [MZ signature in the MS-DOS header and the portable executable (PE) signature in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable)\n[the PE header with ‘XV’. This PlugX variant uses the hard-coded value 0x20140307 to generate a](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/technical%20papers/plugx-thenextgeneration.pdf)\nkey to XOR-decrypt the PlugX configuration information (see Figure 6).\n\n_Figure 6. Analysis of PlugX sample linked to LockFile ransomware activity. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n[PlugX ‘XV’ samples can be grouped into sub-versions based on the hard-coded value in the](https://github.com/rivitna/APT/blob/main/PlugX/PlugX_XV/plugx_xv_versions.txt)\ndecryption routine. One of the other PlugX payloads loaded by HUI Loader was uploaded to\nVirusTotal in 2017 and was not the same sub-version as the indiabullamc . com payload. The\nremaining two samples were the same sub-version as the indiabullamc . com payload and were\n[observed in attacks targeting Southeast Asian organizations in April 2019. CTU researchers are](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/uncovering-new-activity-by-apt-)\nunable to corroborate the BRONZE RIVERSIDE attribution based on the information in the report,\nbut the TTPs align with Chinese threat group activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n[PlugX source code has allegedly been leaked online. However, it is unclear which variant was](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/plugx-a-talisman-to-behold.html)\nleaked and if it has been used by threat groups outside of China. It is unlikely that the indiabullamc\n.com PlugX sub-version is used widely across distinct threat groups or even across multiple\nChinese threat groups. The links connecting LockFile ransomware activity, HUI Loader, and a\nspecific PlugX sub-version associated with Chinese threat group activity suggest that the threat\ngroup responsible for the HUI Loader-linked ransomware activity has access to malware developed\nby Chinese government-sponsored threat groups.\n\nDuring an October 2021 Secureworks incident response engagement, CTU researchers observed\n[likely ransomware precursor activity that overlapped with third-party reporting of LockFile activity.](https://nsfocusglobal.com/insights-into-ransomware-spread-using-exchange-1-day-vulnerabilities-1-2/)\n[The engagement revealed that the threat actors exploited the ProxyShell vulnerabilities in a](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/8/17/from-pwn2own-2021-a-new-attack-surface-on-microsoft-exchange-proxyshell)\nMicrosoft Exchange server to deploy a web shell. They then ran a PowerShell wget command to\ndownload an unidentified file from a server at IP address 45 . 91 . 83 . 176, which the third-party\nreport links to LockFile activity. This server with this IP address [reportedly used a Chinese-](https://twitter.com/JRoosen/status/1429937629877972994)\nlanguage configuration during the LockFile ransomware campaign. Although CTU researchers\ncannot corroborate this claim, VirusTotal reported that the server returned a web page displaying an\nerror message in Chinese.\n\nCTU researchers identified additional artifacts that indicate attribution to a Chinese-speaking threat\ngroup. The inclusion of uncommon Subject DN and Issuer DN fields in an SSL certificate\nassociated with Pandora ransomware C2 infrastructure suggest it was likely generated following\ninstructions on a Chinese-language blog for setting up Cobalt Strike SSL certificates. CTU\nresearchers also detected a Chinese character font in a ransom note dropped by Night Sky\nransomware (see Figure 7).\n\n_Figure 7. Reference to a Chinese font family in a Night Sky ransom note. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n### Links between BRONZE STARLIGHT and BRONZE UNIVERSITY\n\nA January 2022 Secureworks incident response engagement revealed that BRONZE STARLIGHT\ncompromised a server running ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus and deployed HUI Loader with a\n[Cobalt Strike Beacon. CTU researchers observed the Chinese BRONZE UNIVERSITY threat group](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-university)\nactive on the same network with overlapping timeframes. Around mid-November 2021, BRONZE\n[UNIVERSITY compromised this server to deploy ShadowPad malware and stayed active on the](https://www.secureworks.com/research/shadowpad-malware-analysis)\nnetwork until January 2022. In addition to deploying ShadowPad, BRONZE UNIVERSITY\nharvested credentials, moved laterally within the network, and compressed sensitive data for\nexfiltration. The intrusion activity attributed to BRONZE STARLIGHT began in late November 2021\nand ended in early December 2021.\n\nCTU researchers did not observe additional BRONZE STARLIGHT activity after the threat actors\ndeployed and executed HUI Loader to load a Cobalt Strike Beacon. It is unclear why BRONZE\nSTARLIGHT suspended its intrusion activity. The simultaneous and continued operations by\nanother Chinese threat group on the same network suggests that the two groups may have\ndeconflicted their post-intrusion activity. This scenario assumes collaboration and knowledge\n\n\n-----\n\nsharing between the groups. It could indicate that BRONZE STARLIGHT participates in\ngovernment-sponsored intelligence-gathering efforts rather than being a purely financially\nmotivated threat group.\n\n## Targeting and victimology\n\nThe operational cadence and victimology of LockFile, AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and Pandora\ndeployments do not align with conventional financially motivated cybercrime operations. In each\ncase, the ransomware targets a small number of victims over a relatively brief period of time before\nit ceases operations, apparently permanently (see Figure 8). The number of victims is unclear, as\nleak sites often do not list victims who pay ransoms early.\n\n_Figure 8. Timeline of ransomware activity and number of victims listed on each ransomware leak_\n_site. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nCybercrime groups sometimes rebrand their ransomware, often in response to law enforcement or\n[government actions. For example, the GOLD WATERFALL threat group rebranded its Darkside](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-waterfall)\nransomware to BlackMatter likely as a result of law enforcement scrutiny following the Colonial\nPipeline attack. Similarly, [GOLD DRAKE made several changes to its Hades ransomware to hinder](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-drake)\nattribution and enable victims to circumvent payment sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment. Due to the overhead associated with retooling and the impact on revenue,\ncybercriminals tend to only make these adjustments when they are necessary for continued\noperations. These pressures typically do not apply to the BRONZE STARLIGHT ransomware\n[families. While the release of an AtomSilo and LockFile decryptor may have prompted the group to](https://decoded.avast.io/threatintel/decryptor-for-atomsilo-and-lockfile-ransomware/)\ncreate a ransomware family based on Babuk’s source code, the decision to limit the ransomware\nuse to brief, targeted deployments is likely to prevent security researchers from clustering activity\nand identifying trends. The rapid changes in the ransomware landscape make it unlikely that\nresearchers will investigate obsolete ransomware.\n\nBRONZE STARLIGHT operated LockFile as a traditional ransomware scheme but adopted the\nname-and-shame model for the other ransomware operations. It is possible that the change\nprovided a more plausible means of exfiltrating data. The threat actors may also have decided that\nthe public profile would be more effective as a distraction from their true operational objectives.\nPandora is the only ransomware with a leak site as of April 14, 2022, listing five victims. Two earlier\nvictims were removed. Descriptions of each company include anonfiles . com links to ZIP files\ncontaining allegedly stolen data.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs of mid-April, a total of 21 victims had been listed across the AtomSilo, Rook, Night Sky, and\nPandora leak sites. CTU researchers estimate that approximately 75% would be of interest to\nChinese government-sponsored groups focused on espionage based on the victims’ geographic\nlocations and industry verticals. The victims include pharmaceutical companies in Brazil and the\nU.S., a U.S.-based media organization with offices in China and Hong Kong, electronic component\ndesigners and manufacturers in Lithuania and Japan, a law firm in the U.S., and an aerospace and\ndefense division of an Indian conglomerate. The five victims that were not likely targeted for\nespionage include two real estate companies in the Americas, two small financial institutions in the\nU.S., and a small interior design company in Europe. One victim of Rook ransomware was a bank\nin Kazakhstan, which strongly suggests that the threat actors are not based in the Commonwealth\nof Independent States (CIS). There is an unspoken universal agreement among Russian-speaking\nransomware groups not to target entities in those jurisdictions.\n\nThe number and nature of LockFile victims is unclear. Third-party [reporting suggests that victims](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/lockfile-ransomware-new-petitpotam-windows)\nrepresented verticals such as manufacturing, financial services, legal, and engineering, and that\nmost were located in the U.S. and Asia. CTU researchers identified two victims that are consistent\nwith the targeting of a Chinese government-sponsored espionage-focused threat group: a financial\nservices organization in India and a local government entity in the U.S.\n\nVictimology does not provide conclusive attribution. Chinese government-sponsored threat groups\nhave broad targeting, so any ransomware operation could include victims of potential Chinese\ninterest. Conversely, Chinese government-sponsored groups using ransomware as a distraction\nwould likely make the activity resemble financially motivated ransomware deployments. However,\nthe combination of victimology and the overlap with infrastructure and tooling associated with\ngovernment-sponsored threat group activity indicate that BRONZE STARLIGHT may deploy\nransomware to hide its cyberespionage activity. While Chinese government-sponsored groups have\nnot historically used ransomware, there is precedent in other countries. For example, North Korea\n[deployed WCry (also known as WannaCry) for financial gain, the Russian IRON VIKING threat](https://www.secureworks.com/research/wcry-ransomware-analysis)\n[group used NotPetya for its destructive capabilities, and the Iranian COBALT FOXGLOVE threat](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/notpetya-campaign-what-we-know-about-the-latest-global-ransomware-attack)\ngroup used Pay2Key and N3tw0rm ransomware as a destructive wiper against entities in Israel.\n\nBRONZE STARLIGHT likely uses ransomware in these incidents to achieve the following tactical\nobjectives:\n\nDestroy evidence: Encrypting data destroys forensic evidence of espionage activities, making\nit much more challenging for victims to properly assess the threat and protect themselves.\nDistract investigators: Ransomware can significantly impact a compromised organization and\ncan consume all incident response efforts. Pressure to return to normal business operations\ncould prevent victims from detecting suspicious activity that does not directly relate to the\nransomware.\nExfiltrate data: Name-and-shame ransomware exfiltrates data, with an emphasis on\nproprietary or sensitive information. As this data is also targeted in espionage operations, the\nransomware operation could mask the threat actors’ motivation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBRONZE STARLIGHT compromises networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in network perimeter\ndevices, including known vulnerabilities for which patches are available. The threat actors deploy\nHUI Loader to decrypt and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon for command and control. They then\ndeploy ransomware and exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim’s environment.\n\nBoth the exploitation of known vulnerabilities and the use of the Cobalt Strike for command and\ncontrol provide opportunities to detect and prevent BRONZE STARLIGHT intrusion activity before\nexfiltration or ransomware deployment. Network defenders should implement a robust patch\nmanagement process to address network perimeter vulnerabilities in a timely manner. However,\nbreaches can occur even with preventative measures in place. Reactive measures such as a\nrobust and tested incident response plan, real-time network monitoring and alerting, and an\n[extended detection and response (XDR) solution are crucial for minimizing the impact of](https://www.secureworks.com/centers/what-is-xdr)\nransomware and other malicious activity.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 7 can be used to detect activity related to BRONZE STARLIGHT.\nNote that IP addresses can be reallocated.
