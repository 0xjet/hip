The group’s\ngoal appears to have been to deliver a variation of a JavaScript backdoor used by FIN7\nsince at least 2018.[1]\n\n### FIN7\n\nFIN7 is an Eastern European threat group that has been active since at least mid-2015.\nThey primarily target United States (US)-based companies across various industries but\nalso operate on a global scale. The group is one of the world’s most notorious cybercrime\n\n\n-----\n\ngroups and has been credited with the theft of over 15 million payment card records that\ncost organizations around the world approximately one billion dollars (USD) in losses.[2] In\nthe US alone, the group has targeted over 100 companies and compromised the networks\nof organizations in 47 states and the District of Columbia.[3] While FIN7’s primary objective\nis to directly steal financial information, such as credit and debit card data, they will also\nsteal sensitive information to sell on underground marketplaces.\n\nThere has been a concerted attempt by law enforcement to tackle the group, including the\narrest of three members arrested August 2018 and a high-level organizer in April 2021.[4]\nDespite these personnel losses and media attention, the group has continued a steady\nstream of documented activity since at least 2015.[5]\n\n\nIn early 2021, FIN7 was identified as gaining illicit access to a law firm’s network by using a\nfake legal complaint themed around Brown-Forman Inc., the parent company of Jack\nDaniels whiskey.[6]\n\n### Related Groups\n\nFIN7 is closely associated with the threat group referred to as “Carbanak,” with the two\ngroups sharing a significant number of TTPs including the use of the Carbanak backdoor.[7]\nAs such, news media and some intelligence vendors use the names interchangeably. To\nadd to the confusion, different vendors will use their own naming conventions for each\ngroup that include:\n\n\nFIN7 - Carbon Spider (Crowdstrike), Gold Niagara (Secureworks), Calcium (Symantec)\n\nCarbanak - Carbon Spider (Crowdstrike), Anunak (Group-IB)\n\nTrend Micro released a report in April 2021 outlining the differences in TTPs between the\ntwo groups and MITRE also track the two groups separately.[8] For clarity, we will treat FIN7\nand Carbanak as separate groups; the main distinction being FIN7 focuses on hospitality\nand retail sectors, while Carbanak targets banking institutions.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Word Document\n\n**MD5 d60b6a8310373c9b84e6760c24185535**\n\n**File name Users-Progress-072021-1.doc**\n\nThe infection chain began with a Microsoft Word document (.doc) containing a decoy image\nclaiming to have been made with Windows 11 Alpha. The image asks the user to Enable\nEditing and Enable Content to begin the next stage of activity, as shown in Figure 1 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1 – Windows 11-Themed Maldoc_**\n\nAnalyzing the file, we can see a VBA macro populated with junk data as comments, shown\nin Figure 2. Once the content/editing has been enabled, the macro is executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2 – VBA Macro with Junk Data_**\n\nJunk data is a common tactic used by threat actors to impede analysis. Once we remove\nthis junk data, we are left with a VBA macro, as shown in Figure 3 below.\n\n**_Figure 3 – VBA Macro without Junk Data_**\n\nThe VBScript will take encoded values from a hidden table inside the .doc file, shown in\nFigure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4 – Values and Key from Hidden Table_**\n\nThe values are deciphered with the function shown in Figure 5.\n\n**_Figure 5 – Decoding Function in VBScript_**\n\nThe values from the table are deobfuscated using an XOR cipher. In this sample, the key is\n“uPHdq3MxjOCfnXB.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6 – VBA Decoding Function Ported into Python_**\n\nAfter deobfuscating the VBA macro, using the script shown in Figure 6, we can see what is\noccurring in the code.\n\n**_Figure 7 – Checks Carried Out_**\n\nShown in Table 1 are the language checks carried out.\n\n**_Table 1 – Language checks_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**CodeCode** **LanguageLanguage**\n\n1049 Russian\n\n1058 Ukrainian\n\n2073 Russian-Moldova\n\n1070 Sorbian\n\n1051 Slovak\n\n1060 Slovenian\n\n1061 Estonian\n\n3098 Serbian\n\n2074 Serbian (Latin)\n\nIf these languages are detected, the function me2XKr is called which deletes the table and\nstops running.\n\n**_Figure 8 – VM Checks_**\n\nThe script checks for Virtual Machines, as shown in Figure 8, and if detected it stops\nrunning.\n\n**_Figure 9 – Domain Check_**\n\n\n-----\n\nShown in Figure 9, the script checks for the domain CLEARMIND, which appears to refer to\nthe domain of a Point-of-Sale (POS) service provider.\n\nThe checks include:\n\nDomain name, specifically CLEARMIND (Figure 9)\nLanguage, if any of the languages listed in Table 1\nReg Key Language Preference for Russian\nVirtual machine - VMWare, VirtualBox, innotek, QEMU, Oracle, Hyper and Parallels, if\na VM is detected the script is killed (Figure 8)\nMemory Available, if there is less than 4GB then don’t proceed\nCheck for RootDSE via LDAP\n\nIf the checks are satisfactory, the script proceeds to the function where a JavaScript file\ncalled word_data.js is dropped to the TEMP folder. However, if the language and VM\nchecks are detected, the table deletes itself and does not proceed to the JavaScript\npayload. This JavaScript file is also full of junk data, as shown in Figure 10 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10 – JavaScript File (word_data.js) with Junk Data_**\n\nOnce again, we removed the junk data to analyze the JavaScript, which we can see\ncontains obfuscated strings, shown in Figure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11 – Example JavaScript Function without Junk Data_**\n\nThe JavaScript file also contains a deobfuscation function which is shown in Figure 12\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 12 – JavaScript Snippet Containing the XOR Function_**\n\nAnalyzing the XOR cipher function, ‘ben9qtdx4t’ is the key used to decrypt the strings in the\nJavaScript file (word_data.js). The obfuscation is carried out using a substitution cipher that\ngoes from A through K, displayed in Table 2 below.\n\n**_Table 2 – Substitution Cipher_**\n\n**Key** A B C D E F G H I J K\n\n**Code** 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9,\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 13 – Deobfuscated Strings_**\n\nAfter replacing the obfuscated values with the deobfuscated strings, the Javascript\nbackdoor appears to have similar functionality with other backdoors reportedly used by\nFIN7.[9]\n\n**_Figure 14 – First Connection_**\n\nA connection is first made to ‘tnskvggujjqfcskwk.com,’ (Figure 14) and based on the\nresponse, a connection is then made to ‘bypassociation[.]com.’ This address is created by\npicking values from each array (Figure 15) at random.\n\n**_Figure 15 – Path and Arrays_**\n\nAfter connecting to the bypassociation[.]com address, the script checks for an active IP to\nretrieve the MAC address and DNSHostName (Figure 16), which are then submitted via a\nPOST request to the bypassociation address.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 16 – eq5w0 = xgq86 + z897r8d, aka the MAC address and DNSHostName are_**\n_appended to the data sent_\n\nBased on the response, further Javascript is executed, as shown in Figure 17.\n\n**_Figure 17 – Javascript Execution_**\n\n## Attribution\n\nTargeting of a POS provider aligns with previous FIN7 activity\nThe use of decoy doc files with VBA macros also aligns with previous FIN7 activity\nFIN7 have used Javascript backdoors historically\nInfection stops after detecting Russian, Ukrainian, or several other Eastern European\nlanguages\nPassword protected document\nTool mark from Javascript file\n\"group=doc700&rt=0&secret=7Gjuyf39Tut383w&time=120000&uid=\" follows similar\npattern to previous FIN7 campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nThe specified targeting of the Clearmind domain fits well with FIN7 s preferred modus\noperandi. As a California-based provider of POS technology for the retail and hospitality\nsector, a successful infection would allow the group to obtain payment card data and later\nsell the information on online marketplaces. The US Department of Justice calculates that\nas of 2018 FIN7 was responsible for stealing over 15 million card records from 6,500 POS\nterminals.[10]\n\nThe use of a JavaScript backdoor is also primarily associated with FIN7 and is a common\nfeature within its campaigns.[11] It is worth noting that Carbanak has also been known to use\nJavascript payloads but, as this targets retail and health POS systems, it aligns with FIN7\nactivity.\n\n\nWhile not providing solid attribution, the language check function and table it scores against\nindicate a likely geographic location for the creator of this malicious doc file. It is accepted\nas an almost unofficial policy that cybercriminals based in the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS) are generally left alone, provided they do not target interests or\nindividuals within their respective borders, ergo the VBA macro checking the target system\nlanguage against a list including common CIS languages which will terminate the infection if\nfound to match. The addition of Sorbian, a minority German Slavic language, Estonian,\nSlovenian and Slovak are unusual additions as these would not be languages considered\nfor exclusion but would be considered ‘fair game.’ It is worth noting that REvil ransomware\nalso includes these languages in their exclusion tables, a group that is believed to work with\nFIN7.[12]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFIN7 is one of the most notorious financially motivated groups due to the large amounts of\nsensitive data they have stolen through numerous techniques and attack surfaces. Things\nhave been turbulent for the threat group over the past few years as with success and\nnotoriety comes the ever-watchful eye of the authorities. Despite high-profile arrests and\nsentencing, including alleged higher-ranking members, the group continues to be as active\nas ever.[13] US prosecutors believe the group numbers around 70 individuals, meaning the\ngroup can likely accommodate these losses as other individuals will step in.[14] Targeting\ninfrastructure appears to be a more successful method of stopping or delaying these actors.\n\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[1] Kremez, Vitali. 2018.
