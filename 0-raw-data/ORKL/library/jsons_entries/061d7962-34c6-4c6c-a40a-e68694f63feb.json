In 2019, Volexity gave a presentation at RSA](https://www.volexity.com/company/resources/digital-surveillance-and-cyberespionage-at-scale-steven-adair/)\nConference that provided a historic and up-to-date look at various operations of the Vietnamese threat\nactor OceanLotus. Notably, the presentation revealed that, for years, OceanLotus set up and operated\nmultiple activist, news, and anti-corruption websites. At first glance, it appeared these were real\nwebsites that had been compromised. These fake websites were convincingly legitimate and allowed\nOceanLotus to have full control over the tracking of and attacks against website visitors. The most\npopular of these websites even had a corresponding Facebook page with over 20,000 followers.\nShortly after the presentation was given, these websites were shut down or abandoned.\nHowever, old habits and successful techniques die hard. Volexity has identified multiple new attack\ncampaigns being launched by OceanLotus via multiple fake websites and Facebook pages that have\nbeen set up within the last year. In addition to targeting those within Vietnam, Volexity has seen\nrenewed targeting of OceanLotus’s neighbors throughout Southeast Asia. These websites have been\nobserved profiling users, redirecting to phishing pages, and being leveraged to distribute malware\npayloads for Windows and OSX. This post will focus on one of the larger campaigns where OceanLotus\nhas leveraged multiple fake news websites to target users.\n\n**Newsworthy Websites**\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout the year, Volexity identified multiple Vietnamese-language news websites that appeared to\nbe compromised, as they were being used to load an OceanLotus web profiling framework. The exact\nfunctionality varied from site to site, but the goal of these frameworks was to gather information about\nsite visitors and, in some cases, deliver malware. This code appears to be a variation of what Volexity\n[has previously described as Framework A.](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2017/11/06/oceanlotus-blossoms-mass-digital-surveillance-and-exploitation-of-asean-nations-the-media-human-rights-and-civil-society/)\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the websites, Volexity found the sites were not compromised,\ninstead they were created and operated by OceanLotus. Each of the websites appears to have had a\ndecent level of effort to build it, as there are numerous variations in themes, content, and even custom\nimages and slogans.The websites all claim to be news sites and contain a great deal of benign content,\nwith no malicious redirects or profiling in place on the vast majority of pages including the main index\npage. Instead, generally speaking, only a handful of specific articles within each site contain malicious\ncontent. The sites vary in theme, with some focused on Vietnamese news while others are focused on\nnews themed around other Southeast Asian countries.\n\nA list of websites that Volexity has identified is provided below. Each listing includes a thumbnail image\nthat can be clicked to a see larger screen shot of the website. The majority of these websites are still live\nat the time of this blog post and Volexity recommends against visiting them.\n\n**Website** **Theme/Notes**\n\n**baodachieu.com** This website covers general news and is written in Vietnamese. It has a custom logo and slogan indicating it publishes things that others want to hide.\n\n\n**baomoivietnam.-**\n**com**\n\n\nThis website covers general news and is written in Vietnamese. It has a custom logo and tagline indicating it has short and reliable news.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Website** **Theme/Notes**\n\n**ledanvietnam.org** This website shares “the people’s news” and is written in Vietnamese. It is\ndesigned to provide news that is different than that of official government\nnews. It has a custom logo and slogan mentioning truth and responsibility.\n\n**nhansudaihoi13.org** This website is dedicated to news surrounding the upcoming 13th National\nCongress of the Communist Party of Vietnam, which convenes in January\n2021. There is no custom logo or slogan for this website.\n\n**tocaoonline.org** This website is dedicated to news and the “truth.” The website has a customized header image that is displayed on all pages.\n\n**thamcungbisu.org** This website covers general news and is written in Vietnamese. There is no\ncustom logo or slogan for this website. It uses many WordPress defaults to\ninclude the website description of “Just another WordPress site.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Website** **Theme/Notes**\n\n**tinmoivietnam.com** This website covers general news and is written in Vietnamese. There is no\ncustom logo or slogan for this website. The domain name is very similar in\nnaming to a non-malicious website that is accessible via tinmoivietnam.net.\n\n**kmernews.com** This website covers general news and is written in Cambodian. It purports to\nbe an “online newspaper” and does not have a custom logo or slogan.\n\n**laostimenews.com** This website covers general news and is written in English and Laotian. It\nlooks to take much of its content from the website of the Laotian Times (laotiantimes.com). The website does not have a custom logo or slogan.\n\n**malaynews.org** This website covers general news and is written in English and Malay. The\nwebsite does not have a custom logo or slogan.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Website** **Theme/Notes**\n\n\n**philiippines-**\n**news.net**\n\n**khmer-livenews.-**\n**com**\n\n\nThis website covers general news and is written in English. The website does\nnot have a custom logo or slogan.\n\nThis website covers general news and is written in Cambodian. The website\ndoes not have a custom logo or slogan.\n\n\n**khmerleaks.com** This website focuses specifically on Cambodia-centric news and offers content in both Cambodian and English. The slogan for the site is “Stay up to\ndate with the hottest news about the country.”\n\nWhile a couple of the websites above may use a similar layout, the vast majority have their own theme\nand layout which makes the sites appear to have nothing to do with one another. The sites also largely\nstick to a wide variety of news that would be interesting to the masses across the different targeted user\nbases.\n\nHowever, one of the sites is a bit more specific than the rest and is quite political in nature. The website\n**nhansudaihoi13[.]org pertains to the upcoming 13th Vietnamese Communist Congress where new**\npolitical leaders will be elected. This website has a corresponding Facebook page filled with posts copied\nfrom other Vietnamese media outlets focusing on corruption within Vietnamese politics. The page has\nover 1,000 likes and interactions from a number of individuals in Vietnam. Notably, the Facebook page\nhas a Messenger account associated with it which could be used to send messages to individuals of\ninterests.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Targeting Visitors**\n\nThe websites contain numerous articles and content to make them seem legitimate; in some cases the\nwebsites have over 10,000 individual news articles. Volexity has found the content is largely scraped\nand reposted in full from various other legitimate online news outlets. This appears to be done in an\nautomated fashion and most likely through WordPress plugins. Numerous posted articles and images\ncan be directly tracked back to other online blogs and newspapers; sometimes the byline or even\nwatermark in images show directly where the article was sourced. In some cases, only a small number of\npages on the site contains malicious code; in other cases, the profiling code is pervasive.\n\nVolexity believes it is likely that individuals are targeted through these websites in two ways. The first is\nthrough profiling frameworks that exist on many of the pages that can be used to identify and evaluate\ninformation about users that visit the website by happenstance. The second is through individually\ntargeting victims who are sent links to specific news containing malware delivery logic through spear\nphishing and social media messages.\n\nWhen the users visit a page with an infection chain on it, malicious JavaScript is loaded. The exact\nworkflow of the script varies between different infected pages but generally there are two parts:\n\n1. A script to capture and store information about the visitor;\n2. A second script which socially engineers targets into downloading a fake software update or\n\ndocument. The exact nature of the malware downloaded is sometimes configured based on the\nuser’s browser and the content.\n\nTo illustrate a real example of how this worked and looked to a website visitor, the following section will\nuse one of the few pages of the fake site baomoivietnam[.]com that was designed to profile visitors\nand deliver malware or a phishing link. On this site, a news story\n(https://www.baomoivietnam[.]com/dai-hoc-ton-duc-thang-hieu-truong-lam-quyen-de-xay-ra-sai_pham/) about an investigation into potential improper conduct by a university professor in Vietnam_\ncontained malicious content. Once the page was accessed, a special OceanLotus server on the\nhostname cdn.arbenha[.]com would be leveraged to load malicious JavaScript to load a fake video\nplayer. At first, the page would display a dialog indicating that the video was loading (Đang tải) as\nshown in Figure 1 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Fake video player dialog indicating a video is loading_\n\nIf the visitor is coming from a Windows system, after a few seconds the video will fail to load. A message\nwill be displayed indicating that Flash Player is required, along with a button that can be clicked to\nimmediately upgrade. An image of how this appears to the visitor is shown in Figure 2 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Message displayed alerting the user to upgrade Flash Player_\n\nThe button would then lead to the download a RAR archive named Adobe_Flash_Install.rar. This\narchive was designed to fool the targeted user into infected themselves with a Cobalt Strike implant.\nDetails on the contents of this file are included later in this report.\n\nIf a visiting user is on a mobile device that was detected as running iOS or Android, an image is\ndisplayed, indicating that the requested video contains age-restricted content. The visitor is supposed to\n“Sign in” to view the content as shown in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3. Mobile users presented with “Sign in” message_\n\nThe SIGN IN button contained a hyperlink to a page on the hostname accounts.gservice[.]reviews.\nThis page was down did not return interesting content in any of Volexity’s tests. Volexity believes this\npage is likely intended to be used for phishing credentials.\n\nFinally, if users attempt to access the page using a device for which there is no configured payload, they\nare advised to access the content using a different device. The error this is displayed is shown in Figure\n4.\n\n_Figure 4. Message displayed to users not on Windows, Android, or iOS devices._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe appearance of the overlay and the URL for the various buttons shown above are generated\naccording to the visitor’s browser data. A closer look at the payload delivery component of the\nJavaScript is shown below. It shows the malware download URLs hosted on Dropbox for Windows\nusers, and the identical phishing links for Android and iOS visitors.\n\nvar os_url_mapping = {\n‘windows_x86ʹ:’https://www.dropbox[.]com/s/puhwqhjcvn2xuum/Adobe_Flash_Install.rar?dl=1’,\n‘windows_x64ʹ:’https://www.dropbox[.]com/s/puhwqhjcvn2xuum/Adobe_Flash_Install.rar?dl=1’,\n‘linux_x86’:”,\n‘linux_x64’:”,\n‘mac_os’:”,\n‘android’:’https://accounts.gservice[.]reviews/?\nancf_=36562273654a289e0cc0418f1c9d4b&_hhobt=5b878805dc643d7e66d81b45797a3d323baa7def&edobt=5edf2e13ʹ,\n‘ios’:’https://accounts.gservice[.]reviews/?\nancf_=36562273654a289e0cc0418f1c9d4b&_hhobt=5b878805dc643d7e66d81b45797a3d323baa7def&edobt=5edf2e13ʹ\n};\n\nOn other websites, different cloud storage solutions such as Amazon S3 or Google Drive were used to\nhost Windows, OSX, and Android malware payloads. The OSX and Android implants will be detailed in\na future blog.\n\n**Cobalt Strike: For Red Teams and Nation State Actors**\n\nThe Adobe_Flash_install.rar archive that was returned from the baomoivietnam[.]com website\ncontained the files Flash_Adobe_Install.exe and goopdate.dll. The table below provides some\nbasic information on all three of these files.\n\n**Filename** **SHA256** **Notes**\n\n\nAdobe_Fl\nash_Install.rar\n\nFlash_Ad\nobe_Install.exe\n\n\n230ac0808fde525306d6e55d389849f67fc328968c433a5053d676d688032e6f RAR file\ncontaining\nAdobe_\nFlash_In\nstall.exe\nand\ngoopdate.dll\n\n69061e33acb7587d773d05000390f9101f71dfd6eed7973b551594eaf3f04193 A legitimate\ncopy of\nGoogle’s\nUpdate\nutility\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **SHA256** **Notes**\n\n\ngoopdate.dll\n\n\n7fd58fa4c9f24114c08b3265d30be5aa8f6519ebd2310cc6956eda6c6e6f56f0 A malicious\nDLL\ncrafted\nby the\nattacker\n\n\nThe file goopdate.dll has the hidden file attribute set and will not show in Windows Explorer on\nsystems using default settings. This results in the user seeing only the Flash_Adobe_Install.exe file\nto execute in order to install what they believe to be an update to Flash Player. When run, it will\nautomatically load goopdate.dll due to search order hijacking. Goopdate.dll is a highly obfuscated\nloader whose ultimate purpose is to load a Cobalt Strike stager into memory and then execute it. The\nCobalt Strike stager will simply try to download and execute a shellcode from a remote server, in this\ncase using the following URL:\n\n_summerevent.webhop[.]net/QuUA_\n\nThe table below has the details for the returned file from the Cobalt Strike staging server at the time of\nanalysis.\n\n**SHA256** **Notes**\n\n\ncbca9a92a6aa067ff4cab8f1d34ec49ffc9a06c90881f48da369c973182ce06d\n\n\nBEACON binary returned by C2\nserver\n\n\nThis payload is configured to talk to the same domain (summerevent.webhop[.]net) using a malleable\ncommand-and-control (C2) profile for Cobalt Strike that impersonates Google’s Safe Browsing service.\nThis malleable C2 profile is used by a wide variety of red team and real-world attackers. It is readily\n[available on GitHub and has been used by OceanLotus as far back as 2017. The payload contained](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/safebrowsing.profile)\nseveral configuration strings encoded with the single-byte XOR key 0x69. Interesting and relevant\ndecoded strings are listed below:\n\n_summerevent.webhop.net,/safebrowsing/rd/tnOztRgLx1ugKt8uumGcreRFm5CqXD9ge-zzz5sA6WzhC_\n\n_Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0_\n\n_@/safebrowsing/rd/r8l4jO3947jVxa5wBhEijGc0y77iX4oFy_\n\n_GAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8_\n\n_Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5_\n\n_Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate_\n\n_PREF=ID=_\n\n_Cookie_\n\n_GAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8_\n\n_Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5_\n\n_Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate_\n\n_U=sRv85UHijBrrWiHz_\n\n_PREF=ID=_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOceanLotus has continued to evolve the ways in which it seeks to target individuals outside of spear\nphishing and leveraging compromised websites. The creation and maintenance of several websites, for\nthe purpose of creating a larger online presence in which the attack chain against visitors can be fully\ncontrolled, is not an attack method commonly identified. This level of effort shows that OceanLotus will\ngo to great lengths to extend its reach and find new ways to compromise individuals and organizations it\nhas set its focus on.\n\nIndividuals that are at high risk and likely to be targeted by OceanLotus should be particularly careful\nwith respect to websites they are visiting, especially if the websites are suggested or otherwise linked to\nvia e-mail, chat, messaging services, or even SMS. Further, regardless of the websites, Volexity\nrecommends these individuals use extreme caution if a website presents a file for download or requests\nthat they sign in. OceanLotus has used techniques to fool users into revealing their credentials,\nauthorizing malicious OAuth access, or downloading malware onto their systems for several years.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n**Value** **Type** **Notes**\n\nthamcungbisu[.]org Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nbaomoivietnam[.]com Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nbaodachieu[.]com Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nnhansudaihoi13[.]org Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\ntinmoivietnam[.]com Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nlaostimenews[.]com Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\n\n-----\n\nmalaynews[.]org Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nkmernews[.]com Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nphiliippinesnews[.]net Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nledanvietnam[.]org Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nkhmerleaks[.]com Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nkhmer-livenews[.]com Domain Fake site\nset up by\nOceanLotus\n\nhypepodscase[.]com Domain Used to\nhost\nOceanLotus profiling kit and\nmalware\ndelivery\nJS\n\n\narbenha[.]com Hostname\n\n\nUsed to\nhost\nOceanLotus profiling kit and\nmalware\ndelivery\nJS\n\n\ngservice[.]reviews Domain Likely\nused in\nAndroid\nphishing in\nSWC\ncontext\n\n\n-----\n\nsummerevent.webhop[.]net Domain Cobalt\nStrike C2\naddress\n\ndance-til-dawn.podzone[.]net Domain Cobalt\nStrike C2\naddress\n\nandreagahuvrauvin[.]com Domain OceanLotus DNS\nmalware\nC2\naddress\n\n\ntheme.blogwix[.]com Hostname\n\n\nUsed to\nhost\nOceanLotus profiling kit and\nmalware\ndelivery\nJS\n\n\noutlook-client[.]com Domain Likely\nused in\nphishing in\nSWC\ncontext\n\ngusercontent[.]com Domain Likely\nused in\nphishing in\nSWC\ncontext\n\nserrvice[.]net Domain Likely\nused in\nphishing in\nSWC\ncontext\n\nyhsetting[.]com Domain Likely\nused in\nphishing in\nSWC\ncontext\n\nhmacount[.]com Domain Likely\nused in\nphishing in\nSWC\ncontext\n\n\n-----\n\nfontloading[.]com Domain Likely\nused in\nphishing in\nSWC\ncontext\n\nviewerservice[.]com Domain Likely\nused in\nphishing in\nSWC\ncontext\n\ncbca9a92a6aa067ff4cab8f1d34ec49ffc9a06c90881f48da369c973182ce06d SHA256 CobaltStrike\nBeacon\nfile\n\n230ac0808fde525306d6e55d389849f67fc328968c433a5053d676d688032e6f SHA256 RAR delivery file\n\n7fd58fa4c9f24114c08b3265d30be5aa8f6519ebd2310cc6956eda6c6e6f56f0 SHA256 Loader\nDLL\n\n\n-----",
