Multiple ransomware groups that have been\naccumulating access and maintaining persistence on target networks for several months\nactivated dozens of ransomware deployments in the first two weeks of April 2020.\n\n**_Additional resources_**\n_[Protect your organization against ransomware: aka.ms/ransomware](https://aka.ms/ransomware)_\n\n_Learn how attackers operate: Human-operated ransomware attacks: A preventable_\n_disaster_\n\nSo far the attacks have affected aid organizations, medical billing companies, manufacturing,\ntransport, government institutions, and educational software providers, showing that these\nransomware groups give little regard to the critical services they impact, global crisis\nnotwithstanding. These attacks, however, are not limited to critical services, so organizations\nshould be vigilant for signs of compromise.\n\nThe ransomware deployments in this two-week period appear to cause a slight uptick in the\nvolume of ransomware attacks. However, Microsoft security intelligence as well as forensic\ndata from relevant incident response engagements by Microsoft Detection and Response\nTeam (DART) showed that many of the compromises that enabled these attacks occurred\nearlier. Using an attack pattern typical of [human-operated ransomware campaigns, attackers](https://aka.ms/human-operated-ransomware)\nhave compromised target networks for several months beginning earlier this year and have\nbeen waiting to monetize their attacks by deploying ransomware when they would see the\nmost financial gain.\n\nMany of these attacks started with the exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing network\ndevices; others used brute force to compromise RDP servers. The attacks delivered a wide\nrange of payloads, but they all used the same techniques observed in human-operated\nransomware campaigns: credential theft and lateral movement, culminating in the\ndeployment of a ransomware payload of the attacker’s choice. Because the ransomware\ninfections are at the tail end of protracted attacks, defenders should focus on hunting for\nsigns of adversaries performing credential theft and lateral movement activities to prevent\nthe deployment of ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this blog, we share our in-depth analysis of these ransomware campaigns. Below, we will\ncover:\n\nWe have included additional technical details including hunting guidance and recommended\nprioritization for security operations (SecOps).\n\n## Vulnerable and unmonitored internet-facing systems provide easy access to human-operated attacks\n\nWhile the recent attacks deployed various ransomware strains, many of the campaigns\nshared infrastructure with previous ransomware campaigns and used the same techniques\ncommonly observed in human-operated ransomware attacks.\n\nIn stark contrast to attacks that deliver ransomware via email—which tend to unfold much\nfaster, with ransomware deployed within an hour of initial entry—the attacks we saw in April\nare similar to the Doppelpaymer ransomware campaigns from 2019, where attackers gained\naccess to affected networks months in advance. They then remained relatively dormant\nwithin environments until they identified an opportune time to deploy ransomware.\n\nTo gain access to target networks, the recent ransomware campaigns exploited internetfacing systems with the following weaknesses:\n\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Desktop endpoints without multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA)\nOlder platforms that have reached end of support and are no longer getting security\nupdates, such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, exacerbated by\nthe use of weak passwords\nMisconfigured web servers, including IIS, electronic health record (EHR) software,\nbackup servers, or systems management servers\nCitrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) systems affected by [CVE-2019-19781](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027)\nPulse Secure VPN systems affected by [CVE-2019-11510](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11510)\n\nApplying security patches for internet-facing systems is critical in preventing these attacks.\nIt’s also important to note that, although Microsoft security researchers have not observed\nthe recent attacks exploiting the following vulnerabilities, historical signals indicate that these\ncampaigns may eventually exploit them to gain access, so they are worth reviewing: CVE2019-0604, [CVE-2020-0688,](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0688) [CVE-2020-10189.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10189)\n\nLike many breaches, attackers employed credential theft, lateral movement capabilities using\ncommon tools, including Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike, network reconnaissance, and data\nexfiltration. In these specific campaigns, the operators gained access to highly privileged\nadministrator credentials and were ready to take potentially more destructive action if\ndisturbed. On networks where attackers deployed ransomware, they deliberately maintained\ntheir presence on some endpoints, intending to reinitiate malicious activity after ransom is\n\n\n-----\n\npaid or systems are rebuilt. In addition, while only a few of these groups gained notoriety for\nselling data, almost all of them were observed viewing and exfiltrating data during these\nattacks, even if they have not advertised or sold yet.\n\nAs with all human-operated ransomware campaigns, these recent attacks spread throughout\nan environment affecting email identities, endpoints, inboxes, applications, and more.\nBecause it can be challenging even for experts to ensure complete removal of attackers from\na fully compromised network, it’s critical that vulnerable internet-facing systems are\nproactively patched and mitigations put in place to reduce the risk from these kinds of\nattacks.\n\n## A motley crew of ransomware payloads\n\nWhile individual campaigns and ransomware families exhibited distinct attributes as\ndescribed in the sections below, these human-operated ransomware campaigns tended to\nbe variations on a common attack pattern. They unfolded in similar ways and employed\ngenerally the same attack techniques. Ultimately, the specific ransomware payload at the\nend of each attack chain was almost solely a stylistic choice made by the attackers.\n\n### RobbinHood ransomware\n\n[RobbinHood ransomware operators gained some attention for exploiting vulnerable drivers](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/17/secured-core-pcs-a-brief-showcase-of-chip-to-cloud-security-against-kernel-attacks/)\nlate in their attack chain to turn off security software. However, like many other humanoperated ransomware campaigns, they typically start with an RDP brute-force attack against\nan exposed asset. They eventually obtain privileged credentials, mostly local administrator\naccounts with shared or common passwords, and service accounts with domain admin\n\n\n-----\n\nprivileges. RobbinHood operators, like Ryuk and other well-publicized ransomware groups,\nleave behind new local and Active Directory user accounts, so they can regain access after\ntheir malware and tools have been removed.\n\n### Vatet loader\n\nAttackers often shift infrastructure, techniques, and tools to avoid notoriety that might attract\nlaw enforcement or security researchers. They often retain them while waiting for security\norganizations to start considering associated artifacts inactive, so they face less scrutiny.\nVatet, a custom loader for the Cobalt Strike framework that has been seen in ransomware\ncampaigns as early as November 2018, is one of the tools that has resurfaced in the recent\ncampaigns.\n\nThe group behind this tool appears to be particularly intent on targeting hospitals, as well as\naid organizations, insulin providers, medical device manufacturers, and other critical\nverticals. They are one of the most prolific ransomware operators during this time and have\ncaused dozens of cases.\n\nUsing Vatet and Cobalt Strike, the group has delivered various ransomware payloads. More\nrecently, they have been deploying in-memory ransomware that utilizes Alternate Data\nStreams (ADS) and displays simplistic ransom notes copied from older ransomware families.\n[To access target networks, they exploit CVE-2019-19781, brute force RDP endpoints, and](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027)\nsend email containing .lnk files that launch malicious PowerShell commands. Once inside a\nnetwork, they steal credentials, including those stored in the Credential Manager vault, and\nmove laterally until they gain domain admin privileges. The group has been observed\nexfiltrating data prior to deploying ransomware.\n\n### NetWalker ransomware\n\nNetWalker campaign operators gained notoriety for targeting hospitals and healthcare\nproviders with emails claiming to provide information about COVID-19. These emails also\ndelivered NetWalker ransomware directly as a .vbs attachment, a technique that has gained\nmedia attention. However, the campaign operators also compromised networks using\nmisconfigured IIS-based applications to launch Mimikatz and steal credentials, which they\nthen used to launch PsExec, and eventually deploying the same NetWalker ransomware.\n\n### PonyFinal ransomware\n\nThis Java-based ransomware had been considered a novelty, but the campaigns deploying\nPonyFinal weren’t unusual. Campaign operators compromised internet-facing web systems\nand obtained privileged credentials. To establish persistence, they used PowerShell\ncommands to launch the system tool mshta.exe and set up a reverse shell based on a\ncommon PowerShell attack framework. They also used legitimate tools, such as Splashtop,\nto maintain remote desktop connections.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Maze ransomware\n\nOne of the first ransomware campaigns to make headlines for selling stolen data, Maze\ncontinues to target technology providers and public services. Maze has a history of going\nafter managed service providers (MSPs) to gain access to the data and networks of MSP\ncustomers.\n\nMaze has been delivered via email, but campaign operators have also deployed Maze to\nnetworks after gaining access using common vectors, such as RDP brute force. Once inside\na network, they perform credential theft, move laterally to access resources and exfiltrate\ndata, and then deploy ransomware.\n\nIn a recent campaign, Microsoft security researchers tracked Maze operators establishing\naccess through an internet-facing system by performing RDP brute force against the local\nadministrator account. Using the brute-forced password, campaign operators were able to\nmove laterally because built-in administrator accounts on other endpoints used the same\npasswords.\n\nAfter gaining control over a domain admin account through credential theft, campaign\noperators used Cobalt Strike, PsExec, and a plethora of other tools to deploy various\npayloads and access data. They established fileless persistence using scheduled tasks and\nservices that launched PowerShell-based remote shells. They also turned on Windows\nRemote Management for persistent control using stolen domain admin privileges. To weaken\nsecurity controls in preparation for ransomware deployment, they manipulated various\nsettings through Group Policy.\n\n### REvil ransomware\n\nPossibly the first ransomware group to take advantage of the network device vulnerabilities\nin Pulse VPN to steal credentials to access networks, REvil (also called Sodinokibi) gained\nnotoriety for accessing MSPs and accessing the networks and documents of customers –\nand selling access to both. They kept up this activity during the COVID-19 crisis, targeting\nMSPs and other targets like local governments. REvil attacks are differentiated in their\nuptake of new vulnerabilities, but their techniques overlap with many other groups, relying on\ncredential theft tools like Mimikatz once in the network and performing lateral movement and\nreconnaissance with tools like PsExec.\n\n### Other ransomware families\n\nOther ransomware families used in human-operated campaigns during this period include:\n\nParadise, which used to be distributed directly via email but is now used in humanoperated ransomware attacks\nRagnarLocker, which is deployed by a group that heavily uses RDP and Cobalt Strike\nwith stolen credentials\n\n\n-----\n\nMedusaLocker, which is possibly deployed via existing Trickbot infections\nLockBit, which is distributed by operators that use the publicly available penetration\ntesting tool CrackMapExec to move laterally\n\n## Immediate response actions for active attacks\n\nWe highly recommend that organizations immediately check if they have any alerts related to\nthese ransomware attacks and prioritize investigation and remediation. Malicious behaviors\nrelevant to these attacks that defenders should pay attention to include:\n\nMalicious PowerShell, Cobalt Strike, and other penetration-testing tools that can allow\nattacks to blend in as benign red team activities\nCredential theft activities, such as suspicious access to Local Security Authority\nSubsystem Service (LSASS) or suspicious registry modifications, which can indicate\nnew attacker payloads and tools for stealing credentials\nAny tampering with a security event log, forensic artifact such as the USNJournal, or a\nsecurity agent, which attackers do to evade detections and to erase chances of\nrecovering data\n\n[Customers using Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) can consult a](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp)\n[companion threat analytics report for more details on relevant alerts, as well as advanced](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/threat-analytics)\n[hunting queries. Customers subscribed to the Microsoft Threat Experts service can also refer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-threat-experts)\nto the [targeted attack notification, which has detailed timelines of attacks, recommended](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-threat-experts#targeted-attack-notification)\nmitigation steps for disrupting attacks, and remediation advice.\n\nIf your network is affected, perform the following scoping and investigation activities\nimmediately to understand the impact of this breach. Using indicators of compromise (IOCs)\nalone to determine impact from these threats is not a durable solution, as most of these\nransomware campaigns employ “one-time use” infrastructure for campaigns, and often\nchange their tools and systems once they determine the detection capabilities of their\ntargets. Detections and mitigations should concentrate on holistic behavioral based hunting\nwhere possible, and hardening infrastructure weaknesses favored by these attackers as\nsoon as possible.\n\n### Investigate affected endpoints and credentials\n\nInvestigate endpoints affected by these attacks and identify all the credentials present on\nthose endpoints. Assume that these credentials were available to attackers and that all\nassociated accounts are compromised. Note that attackers can not only dump credentials for\naccounts that have logged on to interactive or RDP sessions, but can also dump cached\ncredentials and passwords for service accounts and scheduled tasks that are stored in the\nLSA Secrets section of the registry.\n\n\n-----\n\n[For endpoints onboarded to Microsoft Defender ATP, use advanced hunting to identify](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp)\naccounts that have logged on to affected endpoints. The threat analytics report\ncontains a hunting query for this purpose.\nOtherwise, check the Windows Event Log for post-compromise logons—those that\noccur after or during the earliest suspected breach activity—with event ID 4624 and\nlogon type 2 or 10. For any other timeframe, check for logon type 4 or 5.\n\n### Isolate compromised endpoints\n\nIsolate endpoints that have command-and-control beacons or have been lateral movement\ntargets. Locate these endpoints using advanced hunting queries or other methods of directly\n[searching for related IOCs. Isolate machines using Microsoft Defender ATP, or use other](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/respond-machine-alerts#isolate-machines-from-the-network)\ndata sources, such as NetFlow, and search through your SIEM or other centralized event\nmanagement solutions. Look for lateral movement from known affected endpoints.\n\n### Address internet-facing weaknesses\n\nIdentify perimeter systems that attackers might have utilized to access your network. You can\n[use a public scanning interface, such as shodan.io, to augment your own data. Systems that](https://www.shodan.io/)\nshould be considered of interest to attackers include:\n\nRDP or Virtual Desktop endpoints without MFA\nCitrix ADC systems affected by CVE-2019-19781\nPulse Secure VPN systems affected by CVE-2019-11510\nMicrosoft SharePoint servers affected by CVE-2019-0604\nMicrosoft Exchange servers affected by CVE-2020-0688\nZoho ManageEngine systems affected by CVE-2020-10189\n\nTo further reduce organizational exposure, Microsoft Defender ATP customers can use the\n[Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) capability to discover, prioritize, and remediate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt)\nvulnerabilities and misconfigurations. TVM allows security administrators and IT\nadministrators to collaborate seamlessly to remediate issues.\n\n### Inspect and rebuild devices with related malware infections\n\nMany ransomware operators enter target networks through existing infections of malware\nlike Emotet and Trickbot. These malware families, traditionally considered to be banking\ntrojans, have been used to deliver all kinds of payloads, including persistent implants.\nInvestigate and remediate any known infections and consider them possible vectors for\nsophisticated human adversaries. Ensure that you check for exposed credentials, additional\npayloads, and lateral movement prior to rebuilding affected endpoints or resetting\npasswords.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Building security hygiene to defend networks against human- operated ransomware\n\nAs ransomware operators continue to compromise new targets, defenders should proactively\nassess risk using all available tools. You should continue to enforce proven preventive\nsolutions—credential hygiene, minimal privileges, and host firewalls—to stymie these\nattacks, which have been consistently observed taking advantage of security hygiene issues\nand over-privileged credentials.\n\nApply these measures to make your network more resilient against new breaches,\nreactivation of dormant implants, or lateral movement:\n\nRandomize local administrator passwords using a tool such as LAPS.\n[Apply Account Lockout Policy.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/account-lockout-policy)\nEnsure good perimeter security by patching exposed systems. Apply mitigating factors,\nsuch as MFA or vendor-supplied mitigation guidance, for vulnerabilities.\nUtilize [host firewalls to limit lateral movement. Preventing endpoints from](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3185535/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections)\ncommunicating on TCP port 445 for SMB will have limited negative impact on most\nnetworks, but can significantly disrupt adversary activities.\nTurn on cloud-delivered protection for Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for\nyour antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloudbased machine learning protections block a huge majority of new and unknown\nvariants.\n[Follow standard guidance in the security baselines for Office and Office 365 and the](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/bg-p/Microsoft-Security-Baselines)\n[Windows security baselines. Use Microsoft Secure Score assesses to measures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score?view=o365-worldwide)\nsecurity posture and get recommended improvement actions, guidance, and control.\nTurn on [tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection?view=o365-worldwide)\nservices.\nTurn on [attack surface reduction rules, including rules that can block ransomware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction)\nactivity:\n\nUse advanced protection against ransomware\nBlock process creations originating from PsExec and WMI commands\nBlock credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem\n(lsass.exe)\n\nFor additional guidance on improving defenses against human-operated ransomware and\nbuilding better security posture against cyberattacks in general, read Human-operated\nransomware attacks: A preventable disaster.\n\n## Microsoft Threat Protection: Coordinated defense against complex and wide-reaching human-operated ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat we ve learned from the increase in ransomware deployments in April is that attackers\npay no attention to the real-world consequences of disruption in services—in this time of\nglobal crisis—that their attacks cause.\n\nHuman-operated ransomware attacks represent a different level of threat because\nadversaries are adept at systems administration and security misconfigurations and can\ntherefore adapt to any path of least resistance they find in a compromised network. If they\nrun into a wall, they try to break through. And if they can’t break through a wall, they’ve\nshown that they can skillfully find other ways to move forward with their attack. As a result,\nhuman-operated ransomware attacks are complex and wide-reaching. No two attacks are\nexactly the same.\n\n[Microsoft Threat Protections (MTP) provides coordinated defenses that uncover the](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/technology/threat-protection)\ncomplete attack chain and help block sophisticated attacks like human-operated\nransomware. MTP combines the capabilities of multiple Microsoft 365 security services to\norchestrate protection, prevention, detection, and response across endpoints, email,\nidentities, and apps.\n\nThrough built-in intelligence, automation, and integration, MTP can block attacks, eliminate\ntheir persistence, and auto-heal affected assets. It correlates signals and consolidates alerts\nto help defenders prioritize incidents for investigation and response. MTP also provides a\nunique cross-domain hunting capability that can further help defenders identify attack sprawl\nand get org-specific insights for hardening defenses.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Protection is also part of a [chip-to-cloud security approach that combines](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/17/secured-core-pcs-a-brief-showcase-of-chip-to-cloud-security-against-kernel-attacks/)\nthreat defense on the silicon, operating system, and cloud. Hardware-backed security\nfeatures on Windows 10 like address space layout randomization (ASLR), Control Flow\nGuard (CFG), and others harden the platform against many advanced threats, including\nones that take advantage of vulnerable kernel drivers. These platform security features\nseamlessly integrate with Microsoft Defender ATP, providing end-to-end security that starts\nfrom a strong hardware root of trust. On [Secured-core PCs these mitigations are enabled by](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows10-secured-core-computers)\ndefault.\n\nWe continue to work with our customers, partners, and the research community to track\nhuman-operated ransomware and other sophisticated attacks.
