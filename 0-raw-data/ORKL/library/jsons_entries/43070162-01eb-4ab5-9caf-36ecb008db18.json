This pipeline is 5,500 miles long.\"\n\nBiden said that he expects to see a \"region-by-region return to normalcy\" starting this\nweekend and into next week, but told Americans not to be alarmed or hoard gasoline.\n\n\"Don't panic,” he said. \"I know seeing lines at the pumps or gas stations with no gas can be\nextremely stressful. But this is a temporary situation. Do not get more gas than you need in\nthe next few days … Panic buying will only slow the process.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks about the Colonial Pipeline cyber attack, in the Roosevelt Room\nof the White House in Washington, D.C, on May 13, 2021.\n\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nLooking directly into the camera and leaning into the microphone, Biden warned gas stations\nagainst price-gouging, saying, \"do not try to take advantage of consumers during this time.\"\n\n\"I'm going to work with governors in the affected states to put a stop to price gouging\nwherever it arises. And I'm asking our federal agencies to stand ready to provide assistance\nto state level efforts to monitor and address any price gouging at the pump. Nobody should\nbe using this situation for financial gain.\"\n\n[Colonial Pipeline restarted its system late Wednesday afternoon and in a statement](https://abcnews.go.com/US/colonial-pipeline-restarts-operations-hacking-shutdown/story?id=77653517)\nThursday morning said it's \"made substantial progress\" and that \"product delivery has\ncommenced in a majority\" of markets they service in the southeast.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C., gas stations with fuel\n[outages are over 50%, according to GasBuddy.](https://www.gasbuddy.com/go/colonial-pipeline-shutdown-fuel-outages-by-state)\n\nAttendants direct cars as they line up to fill their gas tanks at a COSTCO in Charlotte, N.C.,\nMay 11, 2021. Fears the shutdown of a major fuel pipeline would cause a gasoline shortage\nled to some panic buying in several locations.\n\nLogan Cyrus/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe president has been briefed on the incident every day since the attack happened Friday\nnight by his counselor Steve Ricchetti and National Security Council chief of staff Yohannes\n[Abraham, a source familiar with the matter told ABC News and first reported by Axios. Biden](https://www.axios.com/colonial-pipeline-hack-biden-energy-crisis-e004b745-43ee-4963-81d7-b10765215a9d.html)\nwas also briefed by White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan twice on Sunday\nand again on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIn sign of the political sensitivities involved, the sources made a point of noting it was clear\nfrom Biden's first briefing that he wanted to be regularly updated on the latest developments\nand, in particular, what was being done to respond.\n\nThe president Thursday reiterated that there was no evidence that the Russian government\n[was behind the attack, but that those involved \"are living in Russia.\"](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/russia-nation)\n\n\n-----\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks about the Colonial Pipeline cyber attack, in the Roosevelt Room\nof the White House in Washington, D.C, on May 13, 2021.\n\nNicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHe told ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce that he believes the\nFBI's assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not involved and that the United\nStates would not be carrying out any kind of retaliatory cyberattacks to shut down the\ncriminals involved.\n\n\"We have been in direct communications with Moscow about the imperative for responsible\ncountries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks. We're also going to\npursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate.\"\n\n## MORE: Consumer prices rise amid growing inflation\n\nThere are few things more politically dangerous than high gas prices, and with the Memorial\nDay holiday around the corner, the president looked to tamper worries with his remarks and\nspoke directly to frustrated Americans, making the case that this issue will be short-lived.\n\n[His remarks came just hours after he signed an executive order to strengthen U.S.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-signs-executive-order-improve-government-response-cyber/story?id=77654403)\ncybersecurity defenses with the goal of preventing similar attacks and after the White House\nhas faced questions about why it wasn’t better prepared to protect its infrastructure.\n\nBiden’s order mandates companies \"doing business with the federal government\" share\ninformation with it about hacks, but would have no implications for private companies that\naren’t.The president acknowledged the restraints in his executive power, admitting “I cannot\n\n\n-----\n\ndictate that the private companies do certain things relative to cybersecurity.\n\nOn Wednesday, a senior administration official said they “pushed the authority as far as we\ncould,” in relation to the executive order and that “anybody doing business with the U.S.\ngovernment will have to share incidents, so that we can use that information to protect\nAmericans more broadly.\"\n\nIt will also require all software bought by the federal government to meet certain security\nstandards within nine months and \"creates a pilot program to create an 'Energy Star' type of\nlabel so the government – and the public at large – can quickly determine whether software\nwas developed securely.\"\n\nPeople line up to get gas at a station in Annapolis, Md., May 12, 2021. After a cyber attack\ncaused the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, fears of gasoline shortage led to panic buying\nin several locations.\n\nJim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnother danger the Biden administration is now confronted with are concerns over inflation\nand rising prices on consumer goods, including gas prices which crossed $3 a gallon on\nWednesday for first time in 7 years.\n\n\n-----\n\nPrices consumers pay for goods like food and gas went up 0.8 percent in April according to\nthe [Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the last 12 months, the “all items index” increased](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/#:~:text=In%20April%2C%20the%20Consumer%20Price,over%20the%20year%20(NSA).)\n4.2%., which is the largest 12-month increase since September 2008. Prices for used cars\nand trucks rose 10% in April as well, making it the largest 1-month increase since the series\nbegan in 1953, and were a significant contributor to the broader increase.\n\nAll three major stock indices fell Wednesday as data indicated inflation was higher than\nexpected in the month of April and investors seem to be nervous that it may be higher and\nmore persistent than the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have been\nforecasting.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki this week said that the administration takes \"the\npossibility of inflation quite seriously\" but that there are \"a range of factors\" in play.\n\n\"There’s a couple of data points that are specific to this moment. And we knew, just as the —\nas the economy, sort of, shrunk and shut down, that, as it’s turning back on, there would be\nsome of these impacts.\"\n\n_ABC News’ Molly Nagle and Zunaira Zaki contributed to this report_\n\nRelated Topics\n\n[Colonial Pipeline Hack](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/ColonialPipelineHack)\n\n\n-----",
