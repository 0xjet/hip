Microsoft\npreviously used ‘Solorigate’ as the primary designation for the actor, but moving\nforward, we want to place appropriate focus on the actors behind the sophisticated\nattacks, rather than one of the examples of malware used by the actors. Microsoft\nThreat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has named the actor behind the attack against\nSolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP malware, and related\n[components as NOBELIUM. As we release new content and analysis, we will use](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/04/goldmax-goldfinder-sibot-analyzing-nobelium-malware/)\nNOBELIUM to refer to the actor and the campaign of attacks.\n\nEven as investigations into the sophisticated attack known as Solorigate are still underway,\ndetails and insights about the tools, patterns, and methods used by the attackers point to\nsteps that organizations can take to improve their defenses against similar attacks.\n[Solorigate is a cross-domain compromise—comprehensive visibility and coordinated defense](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/20/deep-dive-into-the-solorigate-second-stage-activation-from-sunburst-to-teardrop-and-raindrop/)\nare critical in responding to the attack. The same unified end-to-end protection is key to\nincreasing resilience and preventing such attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**This blog is a guide for security administrators using Microsoft 365 Defender and**\n**Azure Defender to identify and implement security configuration and posture**\n**improvements that harden enterprise environments against Solorigate’s attack**\n**patterns.**\n\nThis blog will cover:\n\nThe recommendations on this blog are based on our current analysis of the Solorigate\nattack. While this threat continues to evolve and investigations continue to unearth more\ninformation, we’re publishing these recommendations to help customers apply improvements\ntoday. To get the latest information and guidance from Microsoft, visit\n[https://aka.ms/solorigate. Security operations and incident response teams looking for](https://aka.ms/solorigate)\n[detection coverage and hunting guidance can refer to https://aka.ms/detect_solorigate.](https://aka.ms/detect_solorigate)\n\n## What the Solorigate attack tells us about the state of cyberattacks\n\nSolorigate is a complex, multi-stage attack that involved the use of advanced attacker\ntechniques across multiple environments and multiple domains to compromise high-profile\ntargets. To perpetrate this sophisticated attack, the attackers performed the steps below,\n[which are discussed in detail in this blog:](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/18/analyzing-solorigate-the-compromised-dll-file-that-started-a-sophisticated-cyberattack-and-how-microsoft-defender-helps-protect/)\n\n1. Compromise a legitimate binary belonging to the SolarWinds Orion Platform through a\n\nsupply-chain attack\n2. Deploy a backdoor malware on devices using the compromised binary to allow\n\nattackers to remotely control affected devices\n3. Use the backdoor access on compromised devices to steal credentials, escalate\n\nprivileges, and move laterally across on-premises environments to gain the ability to\ncreate SAML tokens\n4. Access cloud resources to search for accounts of interest and exfiltrate emails\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. High-level end-to-end Solorigate attack chain_\n\nAs its intricate attack chain shows, Solorigate represents a modern cyberattack conducted by\nhighly motivated actors who have demonstrated they won’t spare resources to get to their\ngoal. The collective intelligence about this attack shows that, while hardening individual\nsecurity domains is important, defending against today’s advanced attacks necessitates a\nholistic understanding of the relationship between these domains and how a compromise in\none environment can be a jump-off point to another.\n\nThe Microsoft Defender for Endpoint threat analytics reports published in Microsoft 365\nsecurity center enable customers to trace such cross-domain threats by providing end-to-end\nanalysis of critical threats. In the case of Solorigate, Microsoft researchers have so far\npublished two threat analytics reports, which continue to be updated as additional\ninformation becomes available:\n\n[Sophisticated actor attacks FireEye, which provides information about the FireEye](https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3/a43fc0c6-120a-40c5-a948-a9f41eef0bf9/overview)\nbreach and compromised red-team tools\n[Solorigate supply chain attack, which provides a detailed analysis of the SolarWinds](https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3/2b74f636-146e-48dd-94f6-5cb5132467ca/overview)\nsupply chain compromise\n\nIn addition to providing detailed descriptions of the attack, TTPs, indicators of compromise\n(IoCs), and the all-up impact of the threat to the organization, the threat analytics reports\nempower security administrators to review organizational resilience against the attack and\napply recommended mitigations. These mitigations and other recommended best practices\nare discussed in the succeeding sections. Customers who don’t have access to threat\n[analytics can refer to a publicly available customer guidance.](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint threat analytics report on Solorigate attack_\n\n## Protecting devices and servers\n\nThe attackers behind Solorigate gain initial access to target networks by activating backdoor\ncodes inserted into the compromised SolarWinds binary. Protecting devices against this\nstage of the attack can help prevent the more damaging impact of the latter stages.\n\n### Ensure full visibility into your device estate by onboarding them to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint\n\nIn the ongoing comprehensive research into the complex Solorigate attack, one thing\nremains certain: full in-depth visibility into your devices is key to gaining insights on security\nposture, risk, and potential attack activity. Make sure all your devices are protected and\nmonitored by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\n\n_Figure 3. Status tile in the Device configuration management tab of Microsoft Defender for_\n_Endpoint, showing onboarded devices compared to the total number of devices managed via_\n_Endpoint Manager_\n\n### Identify and patch vulnerable SolarWinds Orion applications\n\nThe Solorigate attack uses vulnerable versions of the SolarWinds Orion application so we\nrecommend that you identify devices running vulnerable versions of the application and\nensure they are updated to the latest version. The threat analytics report uses insights from\n[threat and vulnerability management to identify such devices. On the Mitigations page in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt)\nThreat analytics, you can view the number of devices exposed to vulnerability ID TVM-20200002, which we added specifically to help with Solorigate investigations:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. The Threat analytics Mitigations page shows information on exposed devices_\n\nThe new vulnerability ID TVM-2020-0002 was added to the threat and vulnerability\n[management Weaknesses page in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint so you can easily find](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/tvm-weaknesses)\nexposed devices that have vulnerable SolarWinds software components installed. Additional\ndetails are available in the vulnerability details pane.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Threat and vulnerability management vulnerability details pane for TVM-2020-0002_\n\n[Customers can also use the software inventory page in threat and vulnerability management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/tvm-software-inventory)\nto view the SolarWinds Orion versions present on endpoints in your environment and\nwhether the vulnerable versions are present. Links to the threat analytics reports are\nprovided under the Threats column. You can then assess the footprint of a specific software\nin your organization and identify the impacted devices without the need to run scans across\nthe install base.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Threat and Vulnerability Management software inventory page displaying installed_\n_SolarWinds Orion software_\n\nSecurity recommendations are provided to update devices running vulnerable software\nversions.\n\n_Figure 7. Threat and Vulnerability Management security recommendations page_\n\nSecurity admins can also use advanced hunting to query, refine, and export data. The\n[following query retrieves an inventory of the SolarWinds Orion software in your organization,](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries/blob/master/Campaigns/possible-affected-software-orion%5BSolorigate%5D.md)\norganized by product name and sorted by the number of devices that have software\ninstalled:\n\n_DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities_\n\n_| where SoftwareVendor == ‘solarwinds’_\n\n_| where SoftwareName startswith ‘orion’_\n\n_| summarize dcount(DeviceName) by SoftwareName_\n\n_| sort by dcount_DeviceName desc_\n\n\n-----\n\n[The following query searches threat and vulnerability management data for SolarWinds](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-365-Defender-Hunting-Queries/blob/890b35646df777343e754e45807d91be26575ec2/Campaigns/known-affected-software-orion%5BSolorigate%5D.md)\nOrion software known to be affected by Solorigate:\n\n_DeviceTvmSoftwareInventoryVulnerabilities_\n\n_| where CveId == ‘TVM-2020-0002’_\n\n_| project DeviceId, DeviceName, SoftwareVendor, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion_\n\nFor each security recommendation you can submit a request to the IT administrator to\n[remediate vulnerable devices. Doing this creates a security task in Microsoft Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/tvm-remediation)\nManager (formerly Intune) that can be continuously tracked in the threat and vulnerability\nmanagement Remediation page. To use this capability, you need to enable a Microsoft\nEndpoint Manager connection.\n\n_Figure 8. Threat and vulnerability management ‘Remediation options’ for security_\nrecommendations and ‘Remediation activities’ tracking\n\n### Implement recommended security configurations\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to providing vulnerability assessments, Threat and Vulnerability Management also\nprovides security recommendation guidance and device posture assessment that help\nmitigate this attack. These recommendations use vulnerability data that is also present in the\nSolorigate threat analytics report.\n\n_Figure 9. Threat analytics Mitigation page shows secure configuration recommendations for_\n_devices exposed to Solorigate_\n\nThe following security recommendations are provided in response to Solorigate:\n\n**Component** **Secure configuration recommendations** **Attack**\n**stage**\n\n\nSecurity controls\n(Antivirus)\n\nSecurity controls\n(Antivirus)\n\nSecurity controls (Attack\nsurface reduction)\n\nSecurity controls (Attack\nsurface reduction)\n\nSecurity controls\n(Microsoft Defender\nSmartScreen)\n\n\nTurn on real-time protection Stage\n1\n\n\nUpdate Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions to\nversion 1.329.427.0 or later\n\n\nStage\n1\n\n\nBlock execution of potentially obfuscated scripts Stage\n2\n\n\nBlock executable files from running unless they\nmeet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion\n\nSet Microsoft Defender SmartScreen Microsoft\nEdge site and download checking to block or warn\n\n\nStage\n2\n\nStage\n2\n\n\nApplying these security controls can be accomplished using Microsoft Endpoint Manager\n(Intune and Configuration Manager). Refer to the following documentation for guidance on\ndeploying and managing policies with Endpoint Manager:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Manage endpoint security policies in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/endpoint-security-policy)\n[Windows 10 Antivirus policy settings for Microsoft Defender Antivirus in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows)\n[Intune endpoint security Attack surface reduction settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/endpoint-security-asr-profile-settings)\n\n## Protecting on-premises and cloud infrastructure\n\nIn addition to compromising client endpoints, attackers can also activate backdoor code via\nthe compromised SolarWinds binary installed on cloud or on-premises servers, allowing\nthem to gain a stronger foothold in the environment.\n\n### Protect your on-premises and cloud servers\n\n[A large part of many customers’ infrastructure are virtual machines. Azure Defender helps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/azure-defender)\nsecurity professionals protect cloud workloads spanning virtual machines, SQL, storage,\ncontainers, IoT, Azure network layer, Azure Key Vault, and more.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the key actions that should be taken to help prevent Solorigate\nand similar attacks is to ensure that all devices are protected and monitored by Microsoft\nDefender for Endpoint. Deploying Azure Defender for Servers enables Defender for Endpoint\n[for your virtual machines to provide comprehensive detection coverage across the Solorigate](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/28/using-microsoft-365-defender-to-coordinate-protection-against-solorigate/)\nattack chain. Azure Defender’s integrated vulnerability assessment solution for Azure and\nhybrid machines can also help address the Solorigate attack by providing visibility into\n[vulnerability assessment findings in Azure Security Center.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm#view-findings-from-the-scans-of-your-virtual-machines)\n\n### Enable additional infrastructure protection and monitoring\n\nTo help provide additional in-depth defenses against Solorigate, Azure Defender recently\nintroduced new protection modules for Azure resources. Enabling these protections can\nimprove your visibility into malicious activities and increase the number of Azure resources\nprotected by Azure Defender.\n\n[Azure Defender for Resource Manager allows you to continuously monitor all Azure resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/defender-for-resource-manager-introduction)\nmanagement operations and breadth in protection, which includes the ability to detect\nattempts to exclude known malicious files by the VM Antimalware extension and other\n[suspicious activities that could limit antimalware protection on Azure VMs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/alerts-reference#alerts-resourcemanager)\n\nIn addition, [Azure Defender for DNS ensures that all DNS queries from Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/defender-for-dns-introduction)\nusing Azure DNS, including communication with malicious domains used in the Solorigate\nattack, are monitored, and helps identify Solorigate activity across any of your Azure cloud\nresources. This helps prevent the malicious Solorigate DLL from being able to connect to a\nremote network infrastructure to prepare for possible second-stage payloads.\n\n### Protect your Active Directory and AD FS infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter gaining access, attackers may attempt to steal credentials, escalate privileges, and\nmove laterally in the environment. Having complete visibility into your Active Directory, either\ncompletely on-premises or hosted in IaaS machines, is key in detecting these attacks and\nidentifying opportunities to harden security posture to prevent them.\n\nIn hybrid environments, make sure that Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor components\n[are deployed on all your Domain Controllers and Active Directory Federation Services (AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/whats-new#-release-2136)\nFS) servers. Microsoft Defender for Identity not only detects malicious attempts to\ncompromise your environment but also builds profiles of your on-premises identities for\nproactive investigations and provides you with built-in security assessments. We recommend\nprioritizing the deployment of Microsoft Defender for Identity sensors and using the\n[“Unmonitored domain controllers” security assessment, which lists any detected domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/cas-isp-unmonitored-domain-controller)\ncontrollers in your environment that are unmonitored. (Note: this capability can monitor your\nenvironment only after deploying at least one sensor on a domain controller.)\n\n_Figure 10. Unmonitored domain controllers‘ security assessment in the Microsoft Cloud App_\n_Security portal_\n\n## Protecting Microsoft 365 cloud from on-premises attacks\n\nThe end goal of the attackers behind Solorigate is to gain access to a target organization’s\ncloud environment, search for accounts of interest, and exfiltrate emails. From a\ncompromised device, they move laterally across the on-premises environment, stealing\ncredentials and escalating privileges until they can gain the ability to create SAML tokens\nthat they then use to access the cloud environment. Protecting cloud resources from onpremises attack can prevent the attackers from successfully achieving their long game.\n\n### Implement recommended security configurations to harden cloud posture\n\nFurther best practices and recommendations to reduce the attack surface and protect the\ncloud from on-premise compromise can be found in our protecting Microsoft 365 cloud from\non-premises attacks blog.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Implement conditional access and session control to secure access to cloud resources\n\nIn addition to hardening the individual surfaces to disrupt and prevent the attack, extending\npolicies to implement zero trust and access controls is key in preventing compromised or\nunhealthy devices from accessing corporate assets, as well as governing cloud access from\ncompliant devices.\n\n**Enable conditional access policies**\n\nConditional access helps you better protect your users and enterprise information by making\nsure that only secure users and devices have access. We recommend implementing the\n[common recommended policies for securing access to Microsoft 365 cloud services,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide)\nincluding on-premises applications published with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)\nApplication Proxy.\n\n[Additionally, you can configure user risk and](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-risk-user) [device risk conditional access policies to enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-conditional-access)\naccess to enterprise information based on the risk level of a user or device, helping keep\ntrusted users on trusted devices using trusted applications.\n\n**Enable real-time monitoring and session control**\n\nDirectly integrated with conditional access, session controls in Microsoft Cloud App Security\nenable extending access decisions into the session, with real-time monitoring and control\nover user actions in your sanctioned apps. Implement policies to prevent data exfiltration in\n[risky situations, including blocking or protecting downloads to risky or unmanaged devices,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/best-practices#block-and-protect-download-of-sensitive-data-to-unmanaged-or-risky-devices)\n[as well as for partner users.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/best-practices#secure-collaboration-with-external-users-by-enforcing-real-time-session-controls)\n\n## Additional recommendations and best practices\n\nStrengthen your security posture even further by reviewing all improvement actions available\nvia [Microsoft Secure Score. Secure Score helps operationalize security posture](https://security.microsoft.com/securescore)\nmanagement and improve your organizational security hygiene for your production tenant.\nBelow are some of the Secure Score improvement actions for Azure Active Directory that\nhave a direct impact against Solorigate attack patterns:\n\nDo not allow users to grant consent to unmanaged applications\nEnable Password Hash Sync if hybrid\nEnable policy to block legacy authentication\nEnable self-service password reset\nEnsure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access\nRequire MFA for administrative roles\nTurn on sign-in risk policy\nTurn on user risk policy\nUse limited administrative roles\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, you can use the identity security posture assessment feature in Microsoft\nDefender for Identity to identify common protection gaps that might exist in your\nenvironment. Addressing detection gaps such as the following improves your Microsoft\nSecure Score and improves your overall resilience to a wide range of credential theft attacks:\n\nStop entities that are exposing credentials in cleartext, including ones that are tagged\nas sensitive. Attackers listen to cleartext credentials being sent over the network to\nharvest credentials and escalate privileges. While we have no indication that this\ntechnique was used in Solorigate, this is a general attack trend that organizations must\nbe aware of and prevent.\n\n_Figure 11. Entities exposing credentials in clear text security assessment in the Microsoft_\n_Cloud App Security portal_\n\nRemediate accounts with unsecure attributes that could allow attackers to compromise\nthem once an initial foothold in the environment is established.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. Unsecure account attributes security assessment in the Microsoft Cloud App_\n_Security portal_\n\nReduce risky lateral movement paths to sensitive users. An attacker could move\nacross devices to elevate to a more privileged role and operate deeper in your\norganization’s environment, as we’ve witnessed in the Solorigate attack.\n\n_Figure 13. Risky lateral movement paths security assessment in the Microsoft Cloud App_\n_Security portal_\n\n## Multiple layers of coordinated defense against advanced cross- domain attacks\n\n[Microsoft 365 Defender and](https://aka.ms/m365d) [Azure Defender deliver unified, intelligent, and automated](https://aka.ms/azuredefender)\nsecurity across domains to empower organizations to gain end-to-end threat visibility, which\nas the Solorigate attack has shown, is a critical security capability for all organizations to\nhave. In addition to providing comprehensive visibility and rich investigation tools, Microsoft\n365 Defender and Azure Defender help you to continuously improve your security posture as\n\n\n-----\n\na direct result of insights from collective industry research or your own investigations into\nattacks through configurations you can make directly in the product or in-product\nrecommendations you can implement.\n\nFor additional information and guidance from Microsoft, refer to the following:\n\n\n-----",
