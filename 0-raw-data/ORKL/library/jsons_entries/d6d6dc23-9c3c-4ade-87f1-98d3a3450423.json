We contacted the registrar and\nsoon realized that this is not the only domain that had unauthorized changes. We identified\n93 additional .ch and .li domain names that pointed to the two rogue name servers. While\ndomain hijacking by pointing to a rogue NS is a known attack, 94 domains on a single day is\nvery unusual. So we analyzed what the hijacked domains were used for and soon found out\nthat they are used to infect internet users with malware.\n\nVisitors to the hijacked domains were redirected to the Keitaro TDS (traffic distribution\nsystem):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nhXXp://46.183.219[.]227/VWcjj6\n\n```\nA TDS decides where to redirect the visitor to, often depending on its IP address (i.e.\ncountry),\nuser agent and operating system.\n\nA dead end may look like the following:\n```\nhXXp//46.183.219[.]227/favicon.ico\nhXXp://46.183.219[.]227/www.bingo.com\n\n```\nAnd the visitor will be redirected to Google.\n\nHowever, in some cases, the visitor is redirected to the Rig Exploit Kit:\n```\nhXXp://188.225.87[.]223/?doctor&news=...&;money=...&cars=236&medicine=3848\nhXXp://188.225.87[.]223/?health&news=...\n...\n\n```\nAnd the visitor gets infected.\n\nThe payload is Neutrino Bot:\n```\nMD5: a32f3d0a71a16a461ad94c5bee695988\nSHA256: 492081097c78d784be3996d3b823a660f52e0632410ffb2a2a225bd1ec60973d).\n\n```\nIt gets in touch with its command and control server and grabs additional modules:\n```\nhXXp://poer23[.]tk/tasks.php\nhXXp://poer23[.]tk/modules/nn_grabber_x32.dll\nhXXp://poer23[.]tk/modules/nn_grabber_x64.dll\n\n```\nA little later, it also gets an update\n```\nhXXp//www.araop[.]tk/test.exe\nMD5: 7c2864ce7aa0fff3f53fa191c2e63b59\nSHA256: c1d60c9fff65bbd0e3156a249ad91873f1719986945f50759b3479a258969b38)\n\n## Status\n\n```\nThe rogue NS were inserted in the .ch zone file at around 13:00 today. The registrar\ndiscovered soon what happened and rolled back the unauthorized changes. At 16:00 all of\nthe changes in the .ch & .li zone were reverted and the NS records pointed to the legitimate\nname servers again.\n\n## [Update 10.7.17 17:15]\n\n\n-----\n\n[Gandi the registrar of the 94 domain names has written a blog post, as](https://www.gandi.net/) [well as SCRT the](https://blog.scrt.ch/2017/07/10/numerous-swiss-domain-names-temporarily-hijacked/)\n[domain holder that initially informed us about the domain name hijacking of scrt.ch. SCRT](https://scrt.ch/)\n[also showed how Strict Transport Security protected their recurring visitors from being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)\nredirected to the bogus website!\n\n## Author: Michael Hausding\n\nCompetence Lead DNS & Domain Abuse at SWITCH the ccTLD registry for .ch & .li View all\nposts by Michael Hausding\n\n## 16 thoughts on “94 .ch & .li domain names hijacked and used for drive-by”\n\nComments are closed.\n\n\n-----",
