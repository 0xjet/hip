Using powerful filters, various methods of communication�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Central and Eastern Europe. ESET s SBDH findings were presented during the �Copenhagen Cybercrime**\n**Conference 2016 by researchers Tomáš Gardoň and Robert Lipovský.**\n\n**This toolkit – actually only its initial part – was spreading as an executable with a double extension attached**\n**to a phishing email (counting on Windows’ default behavior of hiding an extension). To further increase its**\n**chances of being run by the receiver, it uses legitimate looking icons of several Microsoft applications or a**\n**Word document.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Upon successful execution, the malware contacts a remote location in order to download two other main**\n**components of the toolkit: a backdoor and a data stealer. The combination of these modules provides the**\n**attacker not only with full remote control of the compromised computer, but also with an advanced method**\n**of data exfiltration.�**\n\n**Thanks to powerful filters the operator can specify in great detail which data should be exfiltrated, using�**\n**conditions such as file extension, date of creation, file size and others. These can be modified via the�**\n**malware configuration files.�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**depends heavily on handling network communication.**\n\n**To increase its chances, it uses multiple methods for connection. First it attempts to use HTTP protocol. If**\n**that fails, the SBDH malware opts for a second method and tries to communicate via SMTP protocol using**\n**a free external gateway.**\n\n**As a last resort, it has the capability to communicate by injecting specially crafted emails into Microsoft**\n**Outlook Express. This way, injected emails were sent under the account of the currently logged user,**\n**allowing the malware to bypass security measures (assuming the user had rights to send and receive**\n**emails). These malicious messages created by the malware were then placed directly in a victim’s outbox,**\n**to avoid their attention.**\n\n**In cases of incoming communication, the malware searched the victim’s inbox in order to identify emails**\n**received with a specific subject. If the toolkit found such emails, they were parsed and checked for�**\n**malware commands. Finally, the subjects of these emails were changed to prevent any further examination**\n**by the malware.**\n\n**However, this last option was only used up until 2006, when Outlook Express was replaced by the newer**\n**Windows Mail application. Since then, the developers of this toolkit have increasingly focused on**\n**improving the HTTP communication method and started camouflaging communications with the C&C�**\n**server by using fake image files (.JPG, .GIF) to carry the data.�**\n\n**In case of the C&C server’s unavailability, the backdoor component had yet another “backup solution” – a**\n**hard-coded URL pointing to a fake image (hosted on a free blog webpage) that contained the address of an**\n**alternative C&C server.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Some of the analyzed samples of this component implemented an interesting persistence method; the**\n**malware was replacing the handler for Word documents. It means, whenever the infected system tries to**\n**open/edit a Word document, the malware gets executed.**\n\n**Last but not least, if you are asking yourself where the name of the toolkit comes from, the “SBDH” string**\n**found in compilation paths of its downloader and – more interestingly – the string “B64SBDH”, acts as a**\n**trigger to download its remaining components from a remote server.**\n\n**Using similar techniques as the malware in** **[Operation Buhtrap, the SBDH espionage toolkit proves that](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/04/09/operation-buhtrap/)**\n**even advanced threats are still being spread via simple vectors, such as malicious email attachments. Yet,**\n**such risks can be spotted by properly trained staff in organizations and further mitigated by implementing a�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hashes:**\n**1345b6189441cd1ed9036ef098adf12746ecf7cb**\n**15b956feee0fa42f89c67ca568a182c348e20ead**\n**f2a1e4b58c9449776bd69f62a8f2ba7a72580da2**\n**7f32cae8d6821fd50de571c40a8342acaf858541**\n**5DDBDD3CF632F7325D6C261BCC516627D772381A**\n**4B94E8A10C5BCA43797283ECD24DF24421E411D2**\n**D2E9EB26F3212D96E341E4CBA7483EF46DF8A1BE**\n**09C56B14DB3785033C8FDEC41F7EA9497350EDAE**\n\n**30**\n\n**LikeLike** **[Whats app](whatsapp://send?text=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/07/01/espionage-toolkit-targeting-central-eastern-europe-uncovered/)**\n\n### You might also be interested in:\n\n\n**LikeLike**\n\n\n**Malicious scripts in compromised websites and how to protect**\n**yourself**\n\n\n**30**\n\n\n**[Nemucod ups its game](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/06/16/nemucod-ups-its-game/)**\n\n**[Infrastructure attacks: The next generation](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/06/07/infrastructure-attacks-next-generation/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Another malware wave hits Europe, mainly downloading Locky**\n**ransomware**\n\n\n**Recommend**\n\n\n**Share** **Sort by Best**\n\n\n## Start the discussion…\n\n\n**Email...**\n\n\n**[About Us](http://www.welivesecurity.com/about-us/)**\n\n\n**Submit**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[How To](http://www.welivesecurity.com/category/how-to/)**\n\n**[Expert Opinion](http://www.welivesecurity.com/category/opinion-2/)**\n\n**[Videos](http://www.welivesecurity.com/media/videos/)**\n\n**[Papers](http://www.welivesecurity.com/papers/conference-papers/)**\n\n**[Our Experts](http://www.welivesecurity.com/our-experts/)**\n\n**[Virus Radar](http://www.virusradar.com/)**\n\n**[Sitemap](http://www.welivesecurity.com/sitemap/)**\n\n**[Privacy](http://www.welivesecurity.com/privacy/)**\n\n**[Legal Information](http://www.welivesecurity.com/legal-information/)**\n\n**COPYRIGHT © 2016 ESET, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.**\n\n\n-----",
