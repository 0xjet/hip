offices\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doj-solarwinds-hackers-breached-emails-from-27-us-attorneys-offices/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doj-solarwinds-hackers-breached-emails-from-27-us-attorneys-offices/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJuly 30, 2021\n08:12 PM\n0\n\nThe US Department of Justice says that the Microsoft Office 365 email accounts of\nemployees at 27 US Attorneys' offices were breached by the Russian Foreign Intelligence\nService (SVR) during the SolarWinds global hacking spree.\n\n\"The APT is believed to have access to compromised accounts from approximately May 7\nto December 27, 2020,\" the DOJ said in a statement issued earlier today.\n\n\"The compromised data included all sent, received, and stored emails and attachments\nfound within those accounts during that time,\n\n\"While other districts were impacted to a lesser degree, the APT group gained access to\n**_the O365 email accounts of at least 80 percent of employees working in the U.S._**\nAttorneys’ offices located in the Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western Districts of New\nYork.\" [emphasis ours]\n\n\n-----\n\nUnited States Attorneys offices breached during the attacks that had at least one\nemployees’ Microsoft O365 email account compromised as part of the SolarWinds supplychain attack directly impacting the U.S. government and the private sector include:\n\nCentral District of California;\nNorthern District of California;\nDistrict of Columbia;\nNorthern District of Florida;\nMiddle District of Florida;\nSouthern District of Florida;\nNorthern District of Georgia;\nDistrict of Kansas;\nDistrict of Maryland;\nDistrict of Montana;\nDistrict of Nevada;\nDistrict of New Jersey;\nEastern District of New York;\nNorthern District of New York;\nSouthern District of New York;\nWestern District of New York;\nEastern District of North Carolina;\nEastern District of Pennsylvania;\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania;\nWestern District of Pennsylvania;\nNorthern District of Texas;\nSouthern District of Texas;\nWestern District of Texas;\nDistrict of Vermont;\nEastern District of Virginia;\nWestern District of Virginia; and\nWestern District of Washington.\n\nEven though other districts were also affected by the attacks to a lesser degree, the\nRussian SVR state hackers managed to breach the O365 email accounts of at least 80\npercent of employees from US Attorneys' offices located in the Eastern, Northern, Southern,\nand Western Districts of New York.\n\n\"After learning of the malicious activity, the Office of the Chief Information Officer eliminated\nthe identified method by which the actor was accessing the O365 email environment and in\naccordance with FISMA, the department took steps to notify the appropriate federal\nagencies, Congress, and the public as warranted,\" the DOJ added.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DOJ confirmed that the hacking group behind the SolarWinds supply-chain attack\n[breached the Department’s Microsoft O365 email environment in a statement published on](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-statement-solarwinds-update)\nJanuary 6, 2021.\n\n[In April, the United States government formally accused the Russian government of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-government-confirms-russian-svr-behind-the-solarwinds-hack/)\norchestrating the SolarWinds attack.\n\nThe White House named the SVR's hacking division (aka APT29, The Dukes, or Cozy\nBear) as the group behind the cyber espionage activity exploiting the SolarWinds Orion\nplatform, which allowed them to access the networks of multiple US federal agencies and\nprivate tech sector firms.\n\n## The SolarWinds Orion supply-chain attack\n\nThe attackers [breached SolarWinds' internal systems and trojanized the Orion Software](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/)\nPlatform source code and builds released between March 2020 and June 2020.\n\nThese malicious builds were later used to deploy a backdoor tracked as Sunburst to \"fewer\nthan 18,000\" victims, but, luckily, the Russian hackers only picked a substantially lower\nnumber of targets for second-stage exploitation.\n\nBefore the attack was disclosed, SolarWinds displayed a list of 300,000 customers\n[worldwide
