However, it’s a LNK shortcut disguised as a DOCX\nfile. Closer inspection reveals that the file uses the “WordPad” application icon instead of a\nDOCX icon. When opened, the specially crafted LNK file executes PowerShell with malicious\ncontent:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Malicious PowerShell commands inside the LNK file.\n\nThe malicious PowerShell code decodes two base64 blobs and writes the output into VBS\nand DOCX files. After that, the PowerShell code opens the DOCX file as a decoy while also\ncreating a new scheduled task that executes the VBS file every three minutes.\n\nThe VBS malware was named “LonePage” by CERT-UA. When executed, it creates a hidden\nPowerShell process that communicates with a hardcoded C2 URL to fetch a text file. The\nrest of the PowerShell code is executed only if the response from the C2 is greater than one\nbyte. In that instance, the PowerShell script checks to see if the string “get-content“ is\nincluded in the text file. If the string is present, then the script executes the code from the\nserver and saves it as an array of bytes. If the string is absent, the script executes a\ncombination of commands inside the text file from the server and some hard-coded basic\nenumeration commands such as “whoami:”\n\nFigure 5: LonePage VBS script.\n\nRegardless of the C2 response, the results of executing the commands inside the txt file or\nthe hardcoded commands are sent back to the same C2 server. However, it is sent to a\ndifferent port via HTTP POST method.\n\nThe DOCX document is a decoy to trick the victim into thinking they’re opening a legitimate\nDOCX file containing a court summons instead of a malicious file:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Contents of DOCX file.\n\n[In early November, another instance of this campaign was observed using a different C2](https://pastebin.com/rpFYCNPS)\naddress — 196.196.156[.]2.\n\nSince the threat actor controls the content of the “upgrade.txt” files, they can change it\naccording to their objectives. As such, the content is not always the same and can vary.\n\n[The following code was observed as a response from the C2 server at 2023-11-08 14:50:30](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/124c805af0ad7388f78fd0d048e4fadbc3217a897012615eb7aff7034d205c0b)\nUTC.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: C2 Get-Screenshot command.\n\nThis PowerShell code is responsible for taking a screenshot. As mentioned above, the\nLonePage VBS sends the results back to the C2, allowing the threat actor to execute any\nPowerShell code on the infected computer and receive the response back.\n\nAt the end of November 2023, another campaign instance was observed using the C2\naddress 2.59.222[.]98. In this case, the payload response from the C2 server aligns with\n[what was described as “recon” activity in the pastebin:](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108142010/https:/pastebin.com/rpFYCNPS)\n\nFigure 8: Recon commands received from C2 server.\n\nThe decoy document is a PDF file instead of a DOCX. And instead of the usual court\nsummons document, the PDF file shows a smudged document:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Smudged decoy PDF document.\n\nHTA Infection Vector\n\nIn contrast to the LNK attack vector described earlier, this attack uses HTA. The HTA method\nis similar, but there are notable differences. Instead of an LNK file invoking PowerShell, the\nHTA file includes HTML code that contains a VBScript that executes PowerShell. The\nscheduled task cadence is also different — it runs every four minutes instead of three in the\nprevious cases.\n\nWhile CERT-UA reported in their advisory that the HTA file drops an HTML file as a decoy,\nDeep Instinct observed a similar court summons DOCX decoy document, like what was\nobserved in the LNK chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: HTA file content.\n\nCVE-2023-38831 Infection Vector\n\nIn both attacks described below, “UAC-0099” exploited a known WinRAR vulnerability,\n[identified by Group-IB and traced back to April 2023.](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/cve-2023-38831-winrar-zero-day/)\n\nThe vulnerability stems from how WinRAR processes ZIP files. The exploitation requires a\nuser to interact with a specially crafted ZIP archive.\n\nHere’s how it works: the attacker creates an archive with a benign filename with a space\nafter the file extension — for example, “poc.pdf .” The archive includes a folder with the same\nname, including the space (something that is not possible under normal conditions, since the\noperating system does not allow the creation of a file with the same name). The folder\nincludes an additional file with the same name as the benign file, including a space, followed\nby a “.cmd” extension.\n\nWhen a user opens a ZIP file containing these files in an unpatched version of WinRAR and\ndouble-clicks on the benign file, the file with the “cmd” extension is executed instead.\n\nThe vulnerability might produce higher infection rates because the attacks are disguised so\nwell; even security-savvy victims can fall for the deception. Expecting to open a benign file,\nthe user will inadvertently execute malicious code.\n\n[You can find a POC for the vulnerability in GitHub. A patched WinRAR (version 6.23) was](https://github.com/deepinstinct/UAC-0099-Targeting_UA)\nreleased on August 2, 2023.\n\nDeep Instinct identified two ZIP files created by “UAC-0099\" on August 5, 2023:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Contents of malicious “cmd” file inside ZIP archive.\n\nThe malicious “cmd” file is different in the two files, each containing a different C2 URI path.\n\nThe modification time between the two files is only two seconds, indicating that, most likely,\nthe files were created in an automated fashion. This, combined with the fact that UAC-0099\nstarted to exploit the vulnerability several days after the patch, shows the level of\nsophistication of the attackers.\n\nWhile Google TAG [identified several Russian threat actors using the vulnerability to attack](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/government-backed-actors-exploiting-winrar-vulnerability/)\nUkrainian targets, the UAC-0099 activity is absent in their blog.\n\nThe CVE assignment and the Group-IB blog about the vulnerability were published after\n“UAC-0099” leveraged the attack technique, indicating they likely knew how to exploit it.\n\nThe decoy used in this campaign was once again the “summon to court” document theme.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe tactics used by “UAC-0099” are simple, yet effective. Despite the different initial infection\nvectors, the core infection is the same — they rely on PowerShell and the creation of a\nscheduled task that executes a VBS file.\n\nMonitoring and limiting the functionality of those components can reduce the risk of “UAC0099” attacks — and/or identify them quickly in the event of compromise.\n\nThe WinRAR exploitation is an interesting choice. Some people don’t update their software\nin a timely fashion, even with automatic updates. WinRAR requires a manual update,\nmeaning that even if a patch is available, many people will likely still have a vulnerable\nversion of WinRAR installed.\n\n[Please make sure you have the latest version of WinRAR installed.](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)\n\n[IOCs and the POC for the CVE-2023-38831 can be found on our GitHub.](https://github.com/deepinstinct/UAC-0099-Targeting_UA)\n\nIOCs\n\n147.78.46[.]40\n\n196.196.156[.]2\n\n2.59.222[.]98\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** **Descriptio**\n\nd21aa84542303ca70b59b53e9de9f092f9001f409158a9d46a5e8ce82ab60fb6 SFX\n\n0eec5a7373b28a991831d9be1e30976ceb057e5b701e732372524f1a50255c7 LNK\n\n8aca535047a3a38a57f80a64d9282ace7a33c54336cd08662409352c23507602 VBS\n\n2c2fa6b9fbb6aa270ba0f49ebb361ebf7d36258e1bdfd825bc2faeb738c487ed Decoy\n\n659abb39eec218de66e2c1d917b22149ead7b743d3fe968ef840ef22318060fd SFX\n\n0aa794e54c19dbcd5425405e3678ab9bc98fb7ea787684afb962ee22a1c0ab51 LNK\n\n4e8de351db362c519504509df309c7b58b891baf9cb99a3500b92fe0ef772924 VBS\n\n53812d7bdaf5e8e5c1b99b4b9f3d8d3d7726d4c6c23a72fb109132d96ca725c2 Decoy\n\n38b49818bb95108187fb4376e9537084062207f91310cdafcb9e4b7aa0d078f9 HTA\n\na10209c10bf373ed682a13dad4ff3aea95f0fdcd48b62168c6441a1c9f06be37 VBS\n\n61a5b971a6b5f9c2b5e9a860c996569da30369ac67108d4b8a71f58311a6e1f1 Decoy\n\n86549cf9c343d0533ef80be2f080a7e3c38c77a1dfbde0a2f89048127979ec2a SFX\n\n762c7289fb016bbcf976bd104bd8da72e17d6d81121a846cd40480dbdd876378 LNK\n\n39d56eab8adfe9eb244914dde42ec7f12f48836d3ba56c479ab21bdbc41025fe VBS\n\nf75f1d4c561fcb013e262b3667982759f215ba7e714c43474755b72ed7f9d01e Decoy\n\n986694cad425c8f566e4e12c104811d4e8b30ce6c4c4d38f919b617b1aa66b05 CVE-2023\n38831 ZIP\n\n54458ebfbe56bc932e75d6d0a5c1222286218a8ef26face40f2a0c0ec2517584 CVE\nPayload\n\n96ab977f8763762af26bad2b6c501185b25916775b4ed2d18ad66b4c38bd5f0d VBS\n\n6a638569f831990df48669ca81fec37c6da380dbaaa6432d4407985e809810da Decoy\n\n87291b918218e01cac58ea55472d809d8cdd79266c372aebe9ee593c0f4e3b77 CVE-2023\n38831 ZIP\n\nf5f269cf469bf9c9703fe0903cda100acbb4b3e13dbfef6b6ee87a907e5fcd1b CVE\nPayload\n\ne34fc4910458e9378ea357baf045e9c0c21515a0b8818a5b36daceb2af464ea0 VBS\n\n2a3da413f9f0554148469ea715f2776ab40e86925fb68cc6279ffc00f4f410dd SFX\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** **Descriptio**\n\n0acd4a9ef18f3fd1ccf440879e768089d4dd2107e1ce19d2a17a59ebed8c7f5d LNK\n\n6f5f265110490158df91ca8ad429a96f8af69ca30b9e3b0d9c11d4fef74091e8 VBS\n\n736c0128402d83cd3694a5f5bb02072d77385c587311274e3229e9b2fd5c5af7 Decoy\n\n\n-----",
