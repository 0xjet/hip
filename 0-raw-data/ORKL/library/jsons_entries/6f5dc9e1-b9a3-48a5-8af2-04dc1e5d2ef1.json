employees\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-modified-mfa-tool-against-indian-govt-employees/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-modified-mfa-tool-against-indian-govt-employees/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nMarch 29, 2022\n12:29 PM\n0\n\nA new campaign from the hacking group tracked as APT36, aka 'Transparent Tribe' or'\nMythic Leopard,' has been discovered using new custom malware and entry vectors in\nattacks against the Indian government.\n\nThe particular threat actor has been active since at least 2016, based in Pakistan, and its\ntargets have historically been almost exclusively Indian defense and government entities.\n\n[The group's goal is to collect intelligence through cyber-espionage, so all in all, APT36 is](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nation-backed-hackers-spread-crimson-rat-via-coronavirus-phishing/)\nconsidered to be a Pakistan-aligned and state-sponsored threat actor.\n\n[Researchers at Cisco Talos have published a report today detailing their recent findings on](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/transparent-tribe-new-campaign.html)\nthe activity of APT36 and underline some interesting new shifts in the threat actor's tactics.\n\n\n-----\n\n## New infection vector\n\nThe most interesting aspect of the new campaign is the use of laced Kavach authentication\napps targeting employees of the Indian government.\n\nKavach Authentication is an OTP application authored by the Indian National Informatics\nCenter for secure multi-factor authentication on critical IT systems.\n\n**Real Kavach app on the Google Play Store**\nThe app is used extensively by military personnel or employees of the Indian government\nthat need to access IT resources like email services or databases.\n\nThe distribution of the fake Kavach installers is done via counterfeit websites that are clones\nof legitimate sites of Indian governments, like that of the Defense Service Officers' Institute.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The downloader of the Kavach app and the malicious payload** _(Cisco)_\nThe victims receive a copy of a legitimate Kavach installer and also a malicious payload\nthat automatically initiates the infection process with the threat actor's malware of choice.\n\nBoth cloned websites and the use of malware masquerading as legitimate and known apps\nare common and previously observed tactics of APT36.\n\n## New custom malware\n\nThe threat actor is still using CrimsonRAT, first spotted in 2020 campaigns, but the malware\nhas evolved to offer more capabilities to its operators.\n\nCrimsonRAT is the primary spearhead tool of APT36, able to steal credentials from the\nbrowser, list running processes, retrieve additional payloads from the C2, and capture\nscreenshots.\n\nIn its 2022 version, CrimsonRAT also employs a keylogger, supports the execution of\narbitrary commands on the compromised system, can read the contents of files, delete files,\nand more.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CrimsonRAT's new command handler** _(Cisco)_\nAnother tool used in the recent campaigns is a lightweight .NET remote access trojan that is\nmore basic compared to CrimsonRAT but still offers powerful functions such as:\n\nList all running processes on the endpoint.\nDownload and execute a file from the C2.\nDownload and execute a file specified by the C2 from another remote location.\nClose connection with the C2 until the next run.\nGather system information from the endpoint such as Computer Name, username,\npublic and local IPs, Operating system name, list of runnings AVs, device type\n(desktop or laptop).\n\nAPT36 likely uses that second implant for redundancy, while it may be just the early\ndevelopment version of a new custom RAT that will be improved with more features in the\nfuture.\n\nIn 2021, APT36 also used ObliqueRAT in very narrow targeting attacks against government\npersonnel while the infection vector then was emails with VBS-laced documents\n\n\n-----\n\nTransparent Tribe is still evolving and remains highly active, improving its implants and\nregularly refreshing its infection vectors to stay elusive and undetectable.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing
