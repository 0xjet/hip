A deeper look into ScanBox\n\nPlease e-mail us at threatintelligence@uk.pwc.com for a version of this report with additional indicators\nthat you are welcome to distribute so long as it is not on public channels (TLP-GREEN).\nWe have observed actors amending the ScanBox framework to evade existing public signatures, detailed\nbelow.\n\n##### Overview\n\nSecurity researchers have often made the mistake of assuming that when a specific tool was observed\nbeing used in espionage attacks, it was representative of activity of a single actor. More frequently,\nhowever, many are now identifying that distinct groups of attackers are sharing their toolsets, just as in\nthe cybercrime world.\n\nOne such toolset, the ScanBox framework, is now shared between a number of groups who conduct\nespionage attacks. Evidence suggests that these groups include those behind the recent Forbes and\nAnthem attacks. This short paper outlines our current perspectives on the previously discussed espionage\ngroups currently using the framework and a hint that a 5[th] player is getting in on the game.\n\nScanBox performs keylogging of users when they visit a compromised website, without requiring malware\nto be deployed, and can collect a great deal of information which can be used to tailor future attacks\n\nIn October we published some details of the ScanBox tool set. Since then we have encountered 24\nadditional sites compromised with the framework. Over this time we have observed changes to the code\nand novel techniques for executing.\n\nWe have also received a number of tip offs from other researchers, as well as queries from victims who\nwere directly targeted by those using the framework. We would like to extend our thanks to these\nindividuals for their contributions towards this research.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Who’s using it, and who’s being targeted?\n\nThe following diagram shows the links in tools and targets between the groups discussed in our previous\nblog, but newer information has since come to light which allows us to more accurately associate these\ngroups with known threat actors:\n\nBetween these clusters, we’ve seen strategic web compromises designed to target users in the following\ncountries:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Variations on the framework\n\nSince our last post there have been several alterations to the ScanBox code base, including new modules,\nchanges to avoid signature based detection, as well as extra techniques to try to identify whether those\nbeing scanned are real machines or researchers.\n\n###### Fears of proliferation\n\nIn some cases we have been able to watch developers update and test variants of the framework, and even\ncome across server-side code being tested by budding hackers.\n\nOur findings are detailed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2. Updates to the ScanBox Framework\n\nFollowing on from our previous post on ScanBox[1], we have watched the clusters of activity outlined with\nclose interest, as well as keeping an eye on new adopters of the ScanBox framework.\n\nFor those who didn’t read our last entry on the framework, nor the excellent work by Jaime Blasco[2] which\npreceded it, ScanBox is a framework written in JavaScript and PHP which allows an attacker to perform\nreconnaissance and key logging of visitors to compromised websites without requiring any malware to be\ndownloaded or installed.\n\nThe framework has remained in use since initial analyses were published, and further analysis of the code,\npublic reporting, as well as the infrastructure used to host ScanBox infections has given us a better picture\nof some of the clusters of activity we identified in our earlier blog.\n\n##### Technical Updates\n\nIn addition to the four websites we previously identified hosting the malicious code, we’ve now identified\na further 24 websites hosting the framework. Anonymised data relating the countries and sectors affected\nare given in appendix A.\n\nBroadly, the ScanBox framework codebase has remained the same, however there are slight nuances in\nsome aspects of the code, or in the software attackers choose to search for.\n\n###### Software checks\n\nIn cases where the attackers have included software checks within their ScanBox code, it tends to be for\nthe same original list of filenames (Appendix C). In some cases the attackers customise the list,\npresumably based on the things they’re expecting to find. For example, adding or removing additional\nsecurity products based on the predominant software providers in their target region.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the standard list includes quite a lot of software which is less relevant to\nsecurity (examples include WinRAR, iTunes and WinZip). Some of these may be included in order to help\nthe attackers to try and identify real victims vs researchers/sandboxes/honeypots. An example list is\nshown in the following screenshot:\n\n1 http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2014/10/scanbox-framework-whos-affected-and-whos-using-it1.html\n2 https://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/blog/scanbox-a-reconnaissance-framework-used-on-wateringhole-attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n###### checkDrives\n\nIn one cluster of ScanBox activity, instead of checking for specific files as per the method above, the\nattackers have implemented a different method of tracking files and drives present on the victim machine.\n\nThe first piece of new functionality is that the attackers build a possible list of drive names (A-Z) and scan\nfor the existence of each drive:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### checkFolders\n\n\nThey do not check files directly either, instead, checking for the presence of a list of folder names:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, rather than determining what security software is present, this check would mainly be useful\nin assisting the attacker with identifying the victim’s operating system. This could then be used to tailor\nfuture attacks (i.e. should I deploy malware which can bypass UAC? Should I send malicious documents\ntargeting CVE-2012-0158 or not?).\n\nAlso, bizarrely the attackers check the path ‘Program Files (x80236)’ – if anyone knows what this\ncorresponds to, please get in touch and let us know.\n\n###### Avoiding analysis?\n\nAs we stated earlier, some of the features of the original ScanBox code were probably designed to help\nthose analysing results distinguish between honeypots/analysis environments and real-world victims.\nThe newly added variables include:\n\n  - colorDepth – This may help to identify virtual machines which are typically configured with\nspecific graphics options.\n\n  - Local Time on the machine – checking that the local time on the machine matches the expected\ntime given the geo-location of the infected IP address – in many cases analysis environments are\nnot configured with the correct time.\n\n###### Updates to evade signatures\n\nPossibly in response to our previous report, we’ve seen some of the groups using ScanBox alter the\ncontent of the modules to evade detection. Attackers do read reports, both to help them attack[3] and also to\nevade detection.\n\nOne change has been the URI formats used to deliver stolen key log data from obvious URLs such as:\n```\n/k.php?data=[KeyloggerData]\n\n```\nTo more subtle URLs such as:\n```\n/[KeyloggerData].jpg\n\n```\nWe also note that following our release of a signature to detect the phrase “No Java or Disable”,\nwhich was present in a number of related frameworks, some of the attackers have now changed this to\n```\n\"No or Disable\".\n\n```\n3 For example as in http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/01/destructive-malware.html\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3. Previously… on ScanBox…\n\n##### Clusters\n\nIn our previous entry on ScanBox we described four clusters of activity – this section includes updates on\nthose clusters.\n\nPreviously, we were only able to cluster activity based on the infrastructure used and the associated\nmalware, we now have a sufficient number of samples to cluster based on differences in implementation\nbetween the code used for ScanBox in each case.\n\n###### Flash Cluster (aka Cluster 1)\n\nThe recently published FBI flash alert #A-000049-MW[4], cited domain names previously referenced in\nour blog as being related to an actor known as Deep Panda, which we’ll get to in a minute. The link\nappears to have been made from the use of the DerUsbi malware family though, which we know to be\nused by several espionage actors.\n\nWhat is interesting is the potential overlap between the target selection of this cluster and the targets of\nthose behind the recently reported Forbes compromise[5,6].\n\nChecking the Google SafeBrowsing results for *.googlecaches.com, shows that the domain was used for\ndistribution of malicious code for a significant period after our previous blog entry:\n\nThis includes distribution via gokbayrak.com. Looking at whether any other domains or IP addresses were\nobserved delivering malicious software via gokbayrak.com shows that it was also observed delivering\nmalware via 88.80.190[.]133. This is the same IP address that was cited in iSight’s reporting of the Forbes\nbreach.\n\n4 http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fbi-pandaflash.png\n5 http://www.invincea.com/2015/02/chinese-espionage-campaign-compromises-forbes/\n6 http://www.isightpartners.com/2015/02/codoso/\n\n\n-----\n\nIn fact, the IP address 88.80.190.133 was involved in the compromise of the same 3 websites as\nSafeBrowsing shows were affected by googlecaches.com.\n\nThe same three sites targeted with the 0-day used in the Forbes attack were also observed distributing\nmalware via googlecaches[.]com - we therefore believe it’s likely that the group we previously described as\n‘Cluster 1’ was behind the Forbes compromise.\n\nWe can use similar techniques to explore other actors who have the same tasking as Cluster 1. In the\nscreenshot of websites delivering malware via gokbayrak.com, we saw that the domain name\nmacanna.com[.]tw was also used to distribute malware from this page.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhilst macanna.com[.]tw appears to be a legitimate site, it has also been observed as being a command\nand control destination for malware. The malware sample in question has a hash of\n3b8d7732de3b3c8823d241e7cd3185c4. The same sample also communicates with\nhappynewyear.dns04[.]com, which in turn resolves to the IP address 115.23.172[.]151, which hosts a large\nnumber of other malicious host names:\n\n\n-----\n\nThese following hostnames are activity associated with the actor best known as TH3Bug[7] - named after\ntheir choice of Poison Ivy password. Their malware samples are present in the same cluster:\n\n7 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/09/recent-watering-hole-attacks-attributed-apt-group-th3bugusing-poison-ivy/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Deep Cluster (aka Cluster 2, centred on news.foundationssl[.]com)\n\nThis cluster relates to the threat actor referred to as Deep Panda by CrowdStrike, as was confirmed in a\nrecent blog post[8]. In turn, this is widely believed to relate to the incident at Anthem, as described in a\nKrebs post[9].\n\nThe graph below shows the links between the we11point.com domain name, and\nnews.foundationssl[.]com as seen on the CrowdStrike blogpost:\n\nThe Krebs article also points toward other possible (although not explicit) links between the domain\nallegedly used in the Anthem hack (we11point.com) to Cluster 2 through shared WHOIS details, as\nwe11point.com was registered by domain re-seller ‘li2384826402@yahoo.com’\n\nOn its own, this would not be sufficient to associate the two clusters, but it is useful to note as a ‘softer’\noverlap.\n\n8 blog.crowdstrike.com/ironman-deep-panda-uses-sakula-malware-target-organizations-multiple-sectors/\n9 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/anthem-breach-may-have-started-in-april-2014/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mystery Cluster 3 (aka Cluster 3, centered on qoog1e[.]com):\n\nCluster 3 remains a mystery, unfortunately the code used in this instance is the most slim line version,\nand has since not been widely re-used – it is unclear who was behind the compromise using this domain\nname.\n\n###### Evil Cluster (aka Cluster 4, centred on webmailgoogle[.]com):\n\nWe’d previously missed the link between Cluster 4 – and malware widely known as ‘EvilGrab’ or\n‘Vidgrab’. From our view point, this malware is exclusively used by one group, known by CrowdStrike as\nStone Panda[10].\n\nIn addition to the four clusters outlined above, within the 24 additional compromises identified, we\nbelieve there are at least 3 other distinct groups using the framework.\n\n##### Digital Quartermastering\n\nIn their 2013 paper ‘From Quartermaster to Sunshop’[11], FireEye described the concept of a Digital\nQuartermaster, a kind of malware supply chain for intrusions, where a skilled team would develop\ntoolsets for a range of attackers who deploy them. The shared use of ScanBox may match up quite well to\nthis hypothesis, and indeed even to some extent the naming schema overlaps, as iSight refer to the actor\nbehind the Forbes breach as Codoso, but suggest they are publically known as ‘Sunshop’. In all likelihood\nthis relates to a series of blogs byFireEye which refer to a series of web compromises in 2013 as being the\nSunShop[12] campaign.\n\nAlthough we did not notice the correlation immediately, there is good overlap between the groups we’ve\ndescribed above, and the clusters of activity described as sharing a Flash 0-day in early 2014 by\nSymantec[13]. Although other groups have since begun using the framework, the first groups to use the\nframework (clusters 1-4) correspond quite nicely to the existing Symantec blog. For reference, we’ve\noverlaid our ScanBox clusters against the likely clusters Symantec created behind the scenes for their\nblog, as well as other popular names:\n\n\n**ScanBox**\n\n**Cluster**\n\n\n**CrowdStrike** **Symantec**\n\n**Group**\n\n\n**Other Names** **Vulnerabilities &**\n\n**Frameworks**\n\n\nScanBox\n\n\nCluster 1 ???

However one group of attackers using\nthe ScanBox framework are now actively sending e-mails to potential victims, where the e-mails contain\nlinks to websites hosting ScanBox. We believe these attackers are not covered by the existing clusters 1\nthrough 4, as the code differs from that used elsewhere.\n\nThis method of sending links rather than waiting for visiting a specific compromised website has two\nmain advantages:\n\n  - The advantage that the attacker doesn’t have to compromise sites that are relevant to the sector\nthey wish to perform reconnaissance against, so generally this will make things easier for the\nattacker; and,\n\n  - The attacker has to deal with fewer false positives in terms of data received from victims. Even\ngood IP whitelisting techniques will result in some false positives, by controlling the visitors\nhowever they can ensure only those they want to scan are scanned.\n\n\nThis group differs from the others based on the following characteristics:\n\n\n\n######  They send e-mails with links to compromised websites, rather than compromising sites of interest\nto their targets. Attackers send links to victims using a similar technique to that described in our\nSofacy phishing blog[14], where multiple redirects are deployed, one being a decoy, the other in this\ncase loading ScanBox:\n\n14 http://pwc.blogs.com/files/tactical-intelligence-bulletin---sofacy-phishing.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Uses the ‘checkFolders’ function within the ScanBox code, rather than explicitly checking for files;\nand,\n\n  - Hosts the ScanBox code on the same page they have compromised rather than on a 3[rd] party IP\naddress or domain name owned by the attacker.\n\nSo far we have identified four low key websites, all belonging to small companies based in the United\nStates or Canada which are being abused in this fashion.\n\n##### 3.1. Going behind enemy lines – fears of proliferation and upcoming\n attacks\n\nAt one point during our investigation into infrastructure hosting ScanBox code, we identified a server\nwhich appeared to be used for development and testing purposes. On this occasion, the server side code\nwas publicly accessible, allowing us to gain insights into the development and testing phase of an attack\nusing ScanBox. This also included the ScanBox framework’s own detailed reconnaissance against the\ndeveloper themselves.\n\nWe noted the developer repeatedly uploading the modified versions to VirusTotal, presumably in an\nattempt to improve evasion of anti-virus.\n\nWe do not believe this developer is part of the core group that has access to the original implementation,\nbut is instead another actor, who is likely rebuilding ScanBox from samples they find online.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshot on the left is from a version currently in development by a possible attacker, the\ncorresponding screenshot on the right is from a public article[15].\n\n15\n###### http://www.cnxhacker.com/2015/01/19/6412.html\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe publication of threat information allows us to draw links between different campaigns, tools and\nmalware but we need to be careful about which links we consider to be significant and ensure we’re\nconfident in how information that’s publically available was derived. The summary above is just our view\nof the overlaps in web based tools/exploits and targets between different threat actors, but those with\ndifferent datasets may be able to draw different conclusions.\n\nLast time, we identified three possible hypotheses to explain the overlap between the ScanBox users, in\nthis blog, based on the data we have available, we can settle on just one of these conclusions:\n\n## “\n\n2. Selections of actors share some resources, as per previous observations with similar kits by\nsome security vendors.\n\n## ”\n\nSpecifically, our key conclusions are:\n\n  - **[High Confidence] - The DQM theory presented by FireEye and later explored by Symantec in**\n2014 about likely tool and exploit sharing between a specific set of groups continues to hold true,\nwe can only speculate as to the nature of the relationships organisationally between these groups.\n\n  - **[Medium Confidence] - We currently believe that the activity represented by Cluster 1 and the**\nactivity related to Th3Bug are distinct, but that there is overlap in who they are tasked to target.\n\n  - **[Low confidence] – Th3Bug is one of the other actors who is in receipt of the same shared**\nresource pool as those clusters already identified in this blog.\n\nWhat is not clear is why specific resources (web-based exploits) appear to be shared, and why others\n(primarily malware families) are sometimes kept within a specific cluster.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 5.
