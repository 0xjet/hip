The goal behind the attack was to extract sensitive information from the victims devices for espionage\npurposes.\n\nOur investigation reveals that APT-C-23 has effectively upgraded its malware arsenal with new tools, dubbed Barb(ie) Downloader and\n_BarbWire Backdoor, which are equipped with enhanced stealth and a focus on operational security. The new campaign that targets Israeli_\nindividuals seems to have a dedicated infrastructure that is almost completely separated from the known APT-C-23 infrastructure which is\nassessed to be more focused on Arabic-speaking targets.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**New Espionage Campaign Targeting Israelis: Cybereason discovered a new and elaborate campaign that targets Israeli individuals**\nand officials. The campaign is characterized as an espionage campaign aiming to steal sensitive information from PCs and mobile\ndevices belonging to a chosen target group of Israeli individuals working for law enforcement, military and emergency services.\n\n**Attribution to APT-C-23: Based on our investigation and previous knowledge of the group, Cybereason assesses with moderate-high**\nconfidence that the group behind the new campaign is APT-C-23, an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group believed to be\noperating on behalf of Hamas.\n\n**Social Engineering as Primary Infection Vector: The attackers used fake Facebook profiles to trick specific individuals into**\ndownloading trojanized direct message applications for Android and PC, which granted them access to the victims’ devices.\n\n**Upgraded Malware Arsenal: The new campaign consists of two previously undocumented malware, dubbed Barb(ie) Downloader and**\n_BarbWire Backdoor, both of which use an enhanced stealth mechanism to remain undetected. In addition, Cybereason observed an_\nupgraded version of an Android implant dubbed VolatileVenom.\n\n**APT-C-23 Stepping Up Their Game: Until recently, the group has been using known tools which served them for years, and were**\nknown for their relatively unsophisticated tools and techniques. The analysis of this recent campaign shows that the group has\nrevamped their toolset and playbook.\n\n## Luring the Victims: A Wolf in a Beauty’s Clothing\n\nTo get to their targets, APT-C-23 has set up a network of fake Facebook profiles that are highly maintained and constantly interacting with\n[many Israeli citizens. The social engineering tactic used in this campaign relies mostly on classic catfishing, using fake identities of attractive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfishing)\nyoung women to engage with mostly male individuals to gain their trust.\n\nThese fake accounts have operated for months, and seem relatively authentic to the unsuspecting user. The operators seem to have\ninvested considerable effort in “tending” these profiles, expanding their social network by joining popular Israeli groups, writing posts in\nHebrew, and adding friends of the potential victims as friends:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fake Facebook account operated by APT-C-23_\n\nIn order to give the profiles an even more authentic appearance, the group uses the accounts to “like” various Facebook groups and pages\nthat are well known to Israelis, such as Israelis news pages, Israeli politicians’ accounts and corporate pages:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Liked_\n\n_profiles showed on the above mentioned Facebook page_\n\nOver time, the operators of the fake profiles were able to become “friends” with a broad spectrum of Israeli citizens, among them some highprofile targets that work for sensitive organizations including defense, law enforcement, emergency services and other government-related\norganizations:\n\n_Some Facebook accounts that interacted with the fake account and their workplace_\n\nAnother example of a fake profile used by APT-C-23 in this campaign, is the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fake Facebook account operated by APT-C-23_\n\n## From Chat to Infection\n\nAfter gaining the victim’s trust, the operator of the fake account suggests migrating the conversation from Facebook over to WhatsApp. By\ndoing so, the operator quickly obtains the target's mobile number. In many cases, the content of the chat revolves around sexual themes,\nand the operators often suggest to the victims that they should use a “safer” and more “discrete” means of communication, suggesting a\ndesignated app for Android.\n\nIn addition, they also entice the victims to open a .rar file containing a video that supposedly contains explicit sexual content. However, when\nthe users open the video they are infected with malware.\n\nThe following diagram captures the flow of the infection:\n\n**The VolatileVenom Malware: A supposedly “secure” and “confidential” Android messaging application.**\n**The Barb(ie) Downloader: A link to a site “hxxps://media-storage[.]site/09vy09JC053w15ik21Sw04” downloads a .rar file that contains**\na private video and the BarbWire Backdoor payload:\n\n_Graph_\n\n_that describes the initial infection chain of the campaign_\n\n## Stage One: Barb(ie) Downloader\n\n\n-----\n\nBarb(ie) is a downloader component used by APT C 23 to install the BarbWire backdoor. As mentioned above, in the infection phase the\ndownloader is delivered alongside a video in a .rar file. The video is meant to distract the victim from the infection process that is happening\nin the background.\n\nThe downloader sample analyzed in this section is named “Windows Notifications.exe”. When first executed, Barb(ie) decrypts strings using\na custom base64 algorithm that is also used in the BarbWire backdoor. Those decrypted strings are different Virtual Machine vendor names,\nWMI queries, command and control (C2), file and folders names which are used in different phases of the execution.\n\nOne way the malware uses those strings is in performing multiple checks, such as anti-vm and anti-analysis checks, in order to determine\nthat “the coast is clear.” If the check fails, a custom pop-up message is displayed to the user and the malware terminates itself:\n\n_Custom pop-up displayed to user before terminating process: “Unable_\n\n_to start program 'http:/localhost:60721/”_\n\nIf the malware finds the target machine to be clean and it doesn’t detect any sandboxing or other analysis being performed on the targeted\ndevice, the malware will continue its execution and collect information about the machine, including username, computer name, date and\ntime, running processes and OS version.\n\nLater, the malware will attempt to create a connection to the embedded C2 server: fausto-barb[.]website. When creating the connection, the\nmalware sends information about the victim machine that is composed of the data collected. In addition, it sends other information to the C2,\nlike the OS version, downloader name and compilation month (“windowsNotification” + “092021”) as well as information on any installed\nAntivirus software running:\n\n_C2 server for Barb(ie) downloader_\n\n_Data sent back to the C2 over http_\n\nBarb(ie) will attempt to download the payload by using the following URI: “/api/sofy/pony”:\n\n_URI structure for_\n\n_Barb(ie) downloader_\n\nIn addition, the downloader creates a file named “adbloker.dat” that stores the encrypted C2, copies itself to programdata and sets\npersistence via two scheduled tasks: “01” and “02”.\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, another Barb(ie) sample that was analyzed with a different name ( Windows Security.exe ) copies itself to appdata as well, but\nrenames the executable to “Windows Notifications.exe” and sets the same persistence:\n\n_Two scheduled tasks created by Barb(ie) downloader for persistence_\n\n_Execution of the Barb(ie) downloader as shown in the Cybereason XDR Platform_\n\nLooking at the metadata of Windows Notifications.exe, it appears that the author of the malware chooses a unique company name and\nproduct name that do not exist as part of Windows: “Windows Security Groups” as the company name, and “Windows Essential” as product\nname:\n\n_Metadata of the Barb(ie) downloader as shown in the Cybereason XDR Platform_\n\nOnce a successful connection has been established with the C2 Barb(ie) will download the payload the BarbWire backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n## BarbWire Backdoor\n\n### Background and Capabilities\n\nThe backdoor component of APT-C-23’s operation is a very capable piece of malware, and it is obvious that a lot of effort was put into hiding\nits capabilities using a custom base64 algorithm. Its main goal is to fully compromise the victim machine, gaining access to their most\nsensitive data. The backdoor’s main capabilities include:\n\nPersistence\nOS Reconnaissance\nData encryption\nKeylogging\nScreen capturing\nAudio recording\nDownload additional malware\nLocal/external drives and directory enumeration\nSteal specific file types and exfiltrate data\n\n### Variants\n\nAccording to the timeline of this operation, there are at least three different variants of the BarbWire backdoor. In addition to the compilation\ntimestamp, there is the “sekop” flag that is used as an identifier for a currently running campaign. It is worth mentioning that the variant that\nwas allegedly compiled in December 2021, still carries the Sep 2021 identifier, perhaps meaning that the Sep 2021 campaign was still\nongoing for at least two months:\n\n\n**MD5 Hash** **Variant** **Compilation**\n**timestamp**\n\nff1c877db4d0b6a37f4ba5d7b4bd4b3b980eddef Early variant 2021-07-04 07:39:15\nUTC\n\n\nad9d280a97ee3a52314c84a6ec82ef25a005467d Analyzed\nCampaign\n\n\n2021-07-07 11:02:11\nUTC\n\n\n**“sekop”** **Similarity**\n\n- 62% with campaign\nvariant\n\n\"&sekop=072021_\" 90% with new\nvariant\n\n“&sekop=092021_” 59% with early\n\n\n4dcdb7095da34b3cef73ad721d27002c5f65f47b New variant 2021-12-28 11:17:12\nUTC\n\n### Initial Execution and Victim Host Profiling\n\n\n[The BarbWire persistence techniques include the creation of a scheduled task and also the implementation of a known Process protection](https://malware.news/t/art-of-anti-detection-4-self-defense/32182)\ntechnique:\n\n_Process protection_\n\n_implementation_\n\nThe malware handles two execution scenarios; If it is being executed from a location that is other than %programdata%, the malware copies\nitself to %programdata%\\WMIhosts and creates a scheduled task:\n\n_The operative path of_\n\n_the BarbWire Backdoor_\n\n\n-----\n\n_The scheduled task_\n\n_created by the malware_\n\nAccording to a second execution scenario, where the file already operates from %appdata%, the malware starts collecting user information\nand gathering OS information including:\n\nPC name\nUsername\nProcess architecture\n\nWindows version\nInstalled AV products using WMI\n\n_WMI query to check installed AV products_\n\nIn order to hide the malware’s most sensitive strings, which can disclose its capabilities and communication patterns, it uses a custom-built\nbase64 algorithm.\n\nAfter successful C2 decryption, the BarbWire backdoor initiates a connectivity check using Google’s domain, and then connects with the C2:\n\n_Connectivity check_\n\n_code snippet_\n\nIt is worth noting that the URIs are in the same format as in the Barb(ie) downloader analyzed above, and other related files pivoted in this\nresearch:\n\n_One of the generated_\n\n_URLs with the same pattern as the downloader_\n\nOnce the initial information is gathered on the victim’s OS and the connectivity check is completed, the BarbWire Backdoor finally initiates the\nconnection with the C2 through a POST request:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Initial POST_\n\n_packet with information on the victim’s machine_\n\nThe data that is sent in the POST request includes:\n\n**Parameter** **Data**\n\nname A double layer encoded victim’s OS information\n\nsov Installed AV name\n\nsekop Campaign identifier and malware filename\n\npos The victim’s OS and architecture\n\n### Data Collection and Exfiltration\n\nThe BarbWire backdoor can steal a wide range of file types, depending on the instructions it receives from its operators. It specifically looks\nfor certain file extensions such as PDF files, Office documents, archives, videos, and images.\n\nIn addition to the local drives found on the host, it also looks for external media such as a CD-Rom drive. Searching for such an old media\nformat, together with the file extensions of interests, could suggest a focus on targets that tend to use more “physical” formats to transfer and\nsecure data, such as military, law enforcement, and healthcare:\n\n_Searching for a CD-Rom drive presence_\n\nBarbWire stores the data it collects from the host on special folders it creates under %programdata%\\Settings where it stores the collected\ndata from the machine. Each stolen “type” (i.e. keylogged data,screen capture data etc.) has its own resource “code name” in the C2,\nappended to the previously generated user id:\n\nBelow is a table summarizing each folder and its main role:\n\n**Folder Name** **Role**\n\n\nactivationData, backup,\nrecoveryFile\n\n\nStaging data in a RAR archive and exfiltration, download additional payloads, volumes and documents of\ninterest enumeration\n\n\nlogFile Audio recording\n\nscanLog Keylogger log file\n\nupdateStatus Screenshots files\n\n\n-----\n\n_Folders created by the_\n\n_BarbWire Backdoor_\n\nOnce the data is being staged and exfiltrated, the data is archived in a .rar file and sent to the C2 to a designated URI:\n\n_Exfiltration of archive data_\n\nAs detailed in the beginning of the analysis, the backdoor also has keylogging and screen capturing data-stealing capabilities. Both are being\nstored in an interesting way, applying unrelated extensions to the files containing the stolen data. This is perhaps another stealth mechanism,\nor just a way for the attacker to distinguish between the different stolen data types:\n\n_Stolen keylogging data_\n\n_A screenshot taken by the malware and saved with an .iso extension_\n\n## VolatileVenom Android Implant Analysis\n\nVolatileVenom is one of APT-C-23’s arsenal of Android malware. The attackers lure the victims into installing the VolatileVenom under the\npretext that the suggested app is more “secure” and “discrete.” Based on our investigation, it seems that VolatileVenom has been\noperationalized and integrated into the group's arsenal since at [least April of 2020, and disguises itself using icons and names of chat](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/09/30/aptc23-group-evolves-its-android-spyware/)\n\n\n-----\n\napplications:\n\n_messaging apps_\n\n\n_Additional Icons of VolatileVenom disguised as_\n\n\nAn example of a fake messaging app used in this campaign, is an Android app named “Wink Chat”:\n\n_Start-up screen of the app_\n\nAfter the user attempts to sign up for the application, an error message pops up and indicates the app will be uninstalled:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Error message after sign-up_\n\nHowever, in reality the application keeps running in the background, and if the Android version of the device is lower than 10, the application\nicon is hidden. If the Android version is higher than Android 10, the application icon is then replaced with the icon of Google Play installer.\nThe attackers have the option to change the application icon to Google Chrome or Google Maps as well.\n\n### Capabilities\n\nVolatileVenom has a rich set of espionage capabilities, which enable attackers to extract a lot of data from their victims.\n\nThe main espionage capabilities are the following:\n\nSteal SMS messages\nRead contact list information\nUse the device camera to take photos\nSteal files with the following extensions: pdf, doc, docs, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, txt, text\nSteal images with the following extensions: jpg, jpeg, png\nRecord audio\nDiscard system notifications\nGet installed applications\nRestart Wi-Fi\nRecord calls / WhatsApp calls\nExtract call logs\nDownload files to the infected device\nTake screenshots\nRead notifications of the following apps: WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, Skype, IMO, Viber\nDiscards any notifications raised by the system\n\n\n-----\n\n_Switch Case of Espionage Commands from the C2_\n\n### C2 Communication\n\nVolatileVenom uses HTTPS and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for C2 communication. The application appears to have two methods to\nretrieve the C2 domain:\n\nFirst the malware decrypts a hard coded encrypted domain which is encrypted and encoded with AES and Base64. The encrypted domain is\nretrieved from a .so (shared object) file. The app loads the .so file (named “liboxygen.so” in the analyzed sample), and executes a function\n(named “do932()” in the analyzed sample) that returns the encrypted domain:\n\n_The malware loads the .so file_\n\n_The encrypted hard-_\n\n_coded domain inside the .so file_\n\nNext, the encrypted domain is decoded and decrypted. In the analyzed sample, the encrypted domain is\n“https://sites google[ ]com/view/linda-lester/lockhart”:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Code snippet of the_\n\n_decryption routine_\n\nTo retrieve the final C2 domain, the malware connects to the decrypted domain and reads the title of the website (ex: FRANCES THOMAS\nCOM) and builds the final C2 domain from that: frances-thomas[.]com:\n\n_The malware builds the final C2 domain from the title of the_\n\n_decrypted domain_\n\nThe second method the malware retrieves the C2 domain is via SMS messages. In case the attackers wish to update the C2 domain, they\nmay send an SMS message containing a new C2 domain to the infected device. The malware intercepts every SMS message, and if a\nmessage arrives from the attackers, the malware will extract the new C2 domain to be used:\n\n_Regex to extract domains from SMS messages_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this report, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team investigated an active espionage campaign that victimizes Israeli citizens, among them high\nprofile targets, for espionage purposes. The campaign featured a classic social engineering tactic known as catfishing, where the group used\nsexual content in order to lure their victims, mostly Israeli men, into downloading malware.\n\nCybereason assesses with moderate-high confidence that APT-C-23, a politically-motivated APT group that operates on behalf of Hamas, is\nbehind the campaign detailed in this report. While the APT-C-23 operations against Arab-speaking targets (mostly Palestinians) are still\ntaking place, this newly identified campaign specifically targets Israelis and shows unique characteristics that distinguish it from other\ncampaigns. The attackers use a completely new infrastructure that is distinct from the known infrastructure used to target Palestinians and\nother Arabic-speakers. In addition, all three malware in use were also specifically designed to be used against Israeli targets, and were not\nobserved being used against other targets.\n\nThe Cybereason investigation found that some victims were infected with both PC and Android malware dubbed Barb(ie) Downloader,\n_BarbWire Backdoor, and VolatileVenom. This “tight grip” on their targets attests to how important and sensitive this campaign was for the_\nthreat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly, this campaign shows a considerable step up in APT C 23 capabilities, with upgraded stealth, more sophisticated malware, and\nperfection of their social engineering techniques which involve offensive HUMINT capabilities using a very active and well-groomed network\nof fake Facebook accounts that have been proven quite effective for the group.\n\nCybereason contacted Facebook and reported the fake accounts.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nLOOKING FOR THE IOCs?
