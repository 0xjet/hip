BlackTDS is a privately held tool that has\nbeen advertising its services on underground markets since the end of December 2017.\n\nBlackTDS offers a variety of services to its clients that they collectively refer to as a “Cloud TDS.”\nThe operators claim that their Cloud TDS can handle social engineering and redirection to\nexploit kits (EKs) while preventing detection by bots -- namely researchers and sandoxes. Cloud\nTDS also includes access to fresh domains with clean reputations over HTTPS if required.\n\nThe services offered by BlackTDS are summarized in their forum advertisements, the text of\nwhich we have left unaltered:\n\n_“Cloacking antibot tds based on our non-abuse servers from $3 per day of work. You do not need_\n_your own server to receive traffic. API for working with exploit packs and own solutions for_\n_processing traffic for obtaining installations (FakeLandings).

The low cost, ease of access, and relatively anonymity of BlackTDS\nreduce the barriers to entry to web-based malware distribution. With full support for social\nengineering and the flexibility to either distribute malware directly or simply redirect victims to\nexploit kit landing pages, BlackTDS demonstrates the continued maturation of crimeware as a\nservice. Moreover, it demonstrates that, despite their steady decline, EKs and web-based attacks\nare not a thing of the past. On the contrary, web-based attack chains are increasingly\n[incorporating social engineering, taking advantage of both existing underlying infrastructure and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/social-engineering-exploit-kits-web-attacks)\nhuman fallibility rather than short-lived exploits.\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\nThanks to @nao_sec for sharing the Japanese regionalized version of the Social Engineering\ntemplates.\n\n\n-----\n\nblacktds[.]com Domain Customer facing\ndomain from\nmiddle of\ndecember 2017 to\nend of february\n2018\n\nblacktds[.]cf Domain Customer facing\ndomain starting\n2018-03-04\n\n88.99.48[.]65 IP Both Victim and\nCustomer facing\nIP from middle of\ndecember 2017 to\nend of february\n2018\n\n46.30.45[.]78 IP Both Victim and\nCustomer facing\nIP starting 201803-04\n\n\nen.sundayloop[.]com|\n193.70.73[.]251\n\n\ndomain|IP BBSindex\nredirector from\n2017-02-06 till\n2017-09-18\n(earlier version of\nBlackTDS in\nprivate mode)\n\n\n6a207ea9d9e60a9bc9de7b1c2b87e06fa85ac31cbbf8c69e1627408c8f3d2b7f SHA256 PDF attachement\nwith link to\nblackTDS - 201802-19\n\n###### Most recent\n\n 6 DAYS AGO\n\n[Leaked source code for Ammyy Admin turned into FlawedAmmyy RAT](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leaked-source-code-ammyy-admin-turned-flawedammyy-rat)\n\n\n[Smominru Monero mining botnet making millions for operators](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/smominru-monero-mining-botnet-making-millions-operators)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Double dipping: Diverting ransomware Bitcoin payments via .onion domains](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/double-dipping-diverting-ransomware-bitcoin-payments-onion-domains)\n\n\n###### 1 MONTH AGO\n\n[Proofpoint Q4 2017 Threat Report: Coin miners and ransomware are front and center](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/proofpoint-q4-2017-threat-report-coin-miners-and-ransomware-are-front-and-center)\n\n###### 2 MONTHS AGO\n\n[Holiday lull?
