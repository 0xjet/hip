CrowdStrike and another firm have been supporting\nSolarWinds in its investigation and root cause analysis of the events that led to the inclusion of unauthorized malicious code into its build cycle. In\n[coordination with SolarWinds, which has posted a blog detailing its efforts to ensure the security of its customers and build processes,](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst)\nCrowdStrike is providing a technical analysis of a malicious tool that was deployed into the build environment to inject this backdoor into the\nSolarWinds Orion platform without arousing the suspicion of the development team charged with delivering the product. At this time,\n[CrowdStrike does not attribute the SUNSPOT implant, SUNBURST backdoor or TEARDROP post-exploitation tool to any known adversary; as](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html&sa=D&ust=1610392135094000&usg=AOvVaw2PE38JjvaIWmhkzPg-HoAG)\nsuch, CrowdStrike Intelligence is tracking this intrusion under the StellarParticle activity cluster.\n\n## Key Points\n\nSUNSPOT is StellarParticle’s malware used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into software builds of the SolarWinds Orion IT management\nproduct.\nSUNSPOT monitors running processes for those involved in compilation of the Orion product and replaces one of the source files to include\nthe SUNBURST backdoor code.\nSeveral safeguards were added to SUNSPOT to avoid the Orion builds from failing, potentially alerting developers to the adversary’s\npresence.\n\nAnalysis of a SolarWinds software build server provided insights into how the process was hijacked by StellarParticle in order to insert\nSUNBURST into the update packages. The design of SUNSPOT suggests StellarParticle developers invested a lot of effort to ensure the code was\nproperly inserted and remained undetected, and prioritized operational security to avoid revealing their presence in the build environment to\nSolarWinds developers.\n\nSUNSPOT was identified on disk with a filename of `taskhostsvc.exe (SHA256 Hash:`\n```\nc45c9bda8db1d470f1fd0dcc346dc449839eb5ce9a948c70369230af0b3ef168 ), and internally named taskhostw.exe by its developers. It\n\n```\nwas likely built on 2020-02-20 11:40:02, according to the build timestamp found in the binary, which is consistent with the currently assessed\nStellarParticle supply chain attack timeline. StellarParticle operators maintained the persistence of SUNSPOT by creating a scheduled task set to\nexecute when the host boots.\n\n### Initialization and Logging\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen SUNSPOT executes, it creates a mutex named `{12d61a41-4b74-7610-a4d8-3028d2f56395} to ensure only one instance is running. It`\nthen creates an encrypted log file at `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\vmware-vmdmp.log . Individual log entries are encrypted with the stream cipher RC4,`\nusing the hard-coded key `FC F3 2A 83 E5 F6 D0 24 A6 BF CE 88 30 C2 48 E7 . Throughout execution, SUNSPOT will log errors to this file,`\nalong with other deployment information. Log entries are delineated by the hex string `32 78 A5 E7 1A 79 91 AC and begin with the number`\nof seconds elapsed since the first log line. Most log lines corresponding to an error contain a step number (e.g., Step19) requiring knowledge of the\nmalware to understand their meaning. These steps and their mapping to the malware actions are provided at the end of this blog. The step\nnumbering does not follow the actual execution order, suggesting the calls to the logging function were added by the developers during the\ncreation of the malware as they progressed and needed to focus their efforts on debugging one part of the code. An extract of a log file generated\nby SUNSPOT in a test environment is given below.\n```\n0.000 START\n22.781[3148] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n194.343[13760] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n324.250[14696] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n351.125[14696] - 0\n352.031[14176] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n376.343[11864] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n439.953[9204] + 'msbuild.exe' [6252]\n485.343[9204] Solution directory: C:\\Users\\User\\Source\n485.343[ERROR]\nStep4('C:\\Users\\User\\Source\\Src\\Lib\\SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer\\BackgroundInventory\\InventoryManager.cs')\nfails\n\n```\nThe malware then grants itself debugging privileges by modifying its security token to add `SeDebugPrivilege . This step is a prerequisite for the`\nremainder of SUNSPOT’s execution, which involves reading other processes’ memory.\n\n### Build Hijacking Steps\n\n**Monitoring of Running Software Build Processes**\n\nAfter initialization, SUNSPOT monitors running processes for instances of `MsBuild.exe, which is part of Microsoft Visual Studio development`\ntools. Copies of `MsBuild.exe are identified by hashing the name of each running process and comparing it to the corresponding value,`\n```\n0x53D525 . The hashing algorithm used for the comparison is ElfHash and is provided in Python in Figure 1.\ndef elf_hash(name):\n  # Test input: b'msbuild.exe'\n  # Test output: 0x53D525\n  h = 0\n  for c in name:\n    v = (c + (h << 4))\n    msb = v & 0xF0000000\n    if msb != 0:\n      v ^= (msb >> 24)\n    h = ~msb & v\n  return h\n\n```\nFigure 1. Process Name Hashing Logic\n\nWhen SUNSPOT finds an `MsBuild.exe process, it will spawn a new thread to determine if the Orion software is being built and, if so, hijack the`\nbuild operation to inject SUNBURST. The monitoring loop executes every second, allowing SUNSPOT to modify the target source code before it\nhas been read by the compiler.\n\nAlthough the mutex created during the initialization should already prevent multiple process monitoring loops from running, the malware checks\nfor the presence of a second mutex — `{56331e4d-76a3-0390-a7ee-567adf5836b7} . If this mutex is found, the backdoor interprets it as a`\nsignal to quit, waits for the completion of its currently running backdoor injection threads, and exits. This mutex was likely intended to be used by\nStellarParticle operators to discreetly stop the malware, instead of using a riskier method such as killing the process. Stopping SUNSPOT in the\nmiddle of its operation could result in unfinished tampering of the Orion source code, and lead to Orion build errors that SolarWinds developers\nwould investigate, revealing the adversary’s presence.\n\n**Command-Line Arguments Extraction from Process Memory**\n\nThe malware extracts the command-line arguments for each running `MsBuild.exe process from the virtual memory using a methodology`\nsimilar to one publicly documented .1\n\nA call to `NtQueryInformationProcess allows the adversary to obtain a pointer to the remote process’s Process Environment Block (PEB),`\nwhich contains a pointer to a `_RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS structure. The latter is read to get the full command line passed to the`\n\n\n-----\n\nThe command line is then parsed to extract individual arguments, and SUNSPOT looks for the directory path of the Orion software Visual Studio\nsolution. This value is hard-coded in the binary, in an encrypted form using AES128-CBC, whose parameters are given below. The same material\nis used for all of the blobs encrypted with AES in the binary.\n\n```\nkey = FC F3 2A 83 E5 F6 D0 24 A6 BF CE 88 30 C2 48 E7 (same as the RC4 key)\n\n```\n```\niv = 81 8C 85 49 B9 00 06 78 0B E9 63 60 26 64 B2 DA\n\n```\n\nThe key and initialization vector (IV) are not unique and can be independently found in other binary samples of several popular video games. It is\nplausible the material was chosen on purpose in order to make static detections on the values impractical.\n\n**Orion Source Code Replacement**\n\nWhen SUNSPOT finds the Orion solution file path in a running `MsBuild.exe process, it replaces a source code file in the solution directory,`\nwith a malicious variant to inject SUNBURST while Orion is being built. While SUNSPOT supports replacing multiple files, the identified copy\nonly replaces `InventoryManager.cs .`\n\nThe malicious source code for SUNBURST, along with target file paths, are stored in AES128-CBC encrypted blobs and are protected using the\nsame key and initialization vector.\n\nAs causing build errors would very likely prompt troubleshooting actions from the Orion developers and lead to the adversary’s discovery, the\nSUNSPOT developers included a hash verification check, likely to ensure the injected backdoored code is compatible with a known source file, and\nalso avoid replacing the file with garbage data from a failed decryption. In the exemplar SUNSPOT sample, the MD5 hash for the backdoored\nsource code is `5f40b59ee2a9ac94ddb6ab9e3bd776ca .`\n\nIf the decryption of the parameters (target file path and replacement source code) is successful and if the MD5 checks pass, SUNSPOT proceeds\nwith the replacement of the source file content. The original source file is copied with a `.bk extension (e.g.,` `InventoryManager.bk ), to back`\nup the original content. The backdoored source is written to the same filename, but with a `.tmp extension (e.g.,` `InventoryManager.tmp ),`\nbefore being moved using `MoveFileEx to the original filename ( InventoryManager.cs ). After these steps, the source file backdoored with`\nSUNBURST will then be compiled as part of the standard process.\n\nSUNSPOT appends an entry in the log file with the date and time of the backdoor attempt and waits for the `MsBuild.exe process to exit before`\nrestoring the original source code and deleting the temporary `InventoryManager.bk file. If the Orion solution build is successful, it is`\nbackdoored with SUNBURST.\n\n**SUNBURST Source Code**\n\nThe source code of SUNBURST was likely sanitized before being included in SUNSPOT. The use of generic variable names, pre-obfuscated\nstrings, and the lack of developer comments or disabled code is similar to what could be obtained after decompiling a backdoored Orion binary, as\nillustrated in Figure 2, which provides a comparison between the injected source code (top) and a decompilation output (bottom).\n\n```\n  private static readonly object _lock = new object();\n\n```\n```\n  private static bool SearchConfigurations()\n\n```\n```\n  {\n\n```\n```\n    using (ManagementObjectSearcher managementObjectSearcher = new\nManagementObjectSearcher(ZipHelper.Unzip(\"C07NSU0uUdBScCvKz1UIz8wzNooPriwuSc11KcosSy0CAA==\")))\n\n```\n```\n    {\n\n```\n```\n      foreach (ManagementObject item in managementObjectSearcher.Get())\n\n```\n```\n      {\n\n```\n```\n        ulong hash =\nGetHash(Path.GetFileName(item.Properties[ZipHelper.Unzip(\"C0gsyfBLzE0FAA==\")].Value.ToString()).ToLower());\n\n```\n```\n        if (Array.IndexOf(configTimeStamps, hash) != -1)\n\n```\n```\n        {\n\n```\n```\n          return true;\n\n```\n```\n        }\n\n```\n```\n      }\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    return false;\n\n```\n```\n  }\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  // Token: 0x0600097C RID: 2428 RVA: 0x000435A4 File Offset: 0x000417A4\n\n```\n```\n  private static bool SearchConfigurations()\n\n```\n```\n  {\n\n```\n```\n    using (ManagementObjectSearcher managementObjectSearcher = new\nManagementObjectSearcher(OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.ZipHelper.Unzip(\"C07NSU0uUdBScCvKz1UIz8wzNooPriwuSc11KcosSy0CAA==\")))\n\n```\n```\n    {\n\n```\n```\n      foreach (ManagementBaseObject managementBaseObject in managementObjectSearcher.Get())\n\n```\n```\n      {\n\n```\n```\n        ulong hash =\nOrionImprovementBusinessLayer.GetHash(Path.GetFileName(((ManagementObject)managementBaseObject).Properties[OrionImprovementBusin\n\n```\n```\n        if (Array.IndexOf<ulong>(OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.configTimeStamps, hash) != -1)\n\n```\n```\n        {\n\n```\n```\n          return true;\n\n```\n```\n        }\n\n```\n```\n      }\n\n```\n```\n    }\n\n```\n```\n    return false;\n\n```\n```\n  }\n\n```\n\nFigure 2. Comparison between injected source code (top) and decompiled using DnSpy (bottom)\n\nIn order to remove compilation warnings that could be generated by the adversary’s own code — which could alert the SolarWinds developers —\nStellarParticle made their edits within `#pragma warning disable and` `#pragma warning restore statements, hinting at what parts were`\nedited. In particular, SUNSPOT’s entry point was added to the legitimate Orion software `RefreshInternal function by adding the following`\ntry/catch block:\n\ntry {  if (!OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.IsAlive) {\n\nThread th = new Thread(OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.Initialize)\n\n{ IsBackground = true };\n\nth.Start();\n\n}\n\n} catch (Exception) {\n\n}\n\n### Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)\n\nThe following TTPs may be used to characterize the SUNSPOT activity described in this blog:\n\nPersistence using scheduled tasks, triggered at boot time\nUse of AES128-CBC to protect the targeted source code files and the backdoored source code file in the binary\nUse of RC4 encryption with a hard-coded key to protect the log file entries\nLog entries from different executions of the malware that are separated with a hard-coded value `32 78 A5 E7 1A 79 91 AC`\nLog file creation in the system temp directory `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\vmware-vmdmp.log masquerading as a legitimate VMWare log file`\nDetection of the targeted Visual Studio solution build by reading the virtual memory of `MsBuild.exe processes, looking for the targeted`\nsolution filename\nAccess to the remote process arguments made via the remote process’s PEB structure\nReplacement of source code files during the build process, before compilation, by replacing file content with another version containing\nSUNBURST\nInsertion of the backdoor code within `#pragma statements disabling and restoring warnings, to prevent the backdoor code lines from`\nappearing in build logs\nCheck of the MD5 hashes of the original source code and of the backdoored source code to ensure the tampering will not cause build errors\nAttempt to open a non-existing mutex to detect when the malware operators want the backdoor to stop execution and safely exit\n\n\n-----\n\n## Host Indicators of Attack\n\nThe tables below detail files belonging to the
