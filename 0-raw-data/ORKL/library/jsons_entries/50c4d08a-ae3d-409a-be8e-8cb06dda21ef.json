This\nransomware appends the .velso extension to encrypted files and then drops a ransom note\nthat contains an email address that a victim can use to contact the developer.\n\nIn this article I will provide a brief summary of what we know about the velso ransomware\nand how you can protect yourself from it. You can also discuss or receive support for the\n[Velso Ransomware in our dedicated Velso Ransomware Help & Support Topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/669206/velso-ransomware-help-support-topic-velso-get-my-filestxt/)\n\n### What we know about the Velso Ransomware\n\n[The Velso Ransomware was first discovered by Michael Gillespie when saw a submission to](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nhis ID-Ransomware site. After tweeting about the sample, another researcher named Martin\nStopka was able to find a sample of the infection.\n\n[https://t.co/L1zrLcUbOC](https://t.co/L1zrLcUbOC)\n\n— Martin Stopka (@stopka_martin) [January 17, 2018](https://twitter.com/stopka_martin/status/953703184513544192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWhile it is not 100% confirmed, it appears that the Velso Ransomware is installed manually\nby an attacker hacking into a victim's computer via remote desktop services. The attacker\nthen manually executes the ransomware file. This causes it to display the victim's ID and\nthen the decryption key while it pauses waiting for the attacker to press a key on the\nkeyboard.\n\nOnce the attacker has finished copying the two strings, they can press any key and start the\nprocess of encrypting the computer. You can see below what the ransomware looks like when\nit was executed by BleepingComputer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Velso Ransomware**\n\nWhen encrypting files, it will modify the filename by appending the .velso extension to the\nencrypted file's name. For example, a file named test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed to\ntest.jpg.velso.\n\n**Folder of Encrypted Velso Files**\n\n\n-----\n\nA ransom note will also be created in every folder that a file is encrypted. This ransom note is\nnamed get_my_files.txt and contains an email address that a victim can contact for\npayment instructions and the victim's unique ID. The current email address is\nMerlinVelso@protonmail.com.\n\n**Velso Ransom Note**\n\nThe get_my_files.txt will be copied in the Windows Startup folder so that it is automatically\ndisplayed when a user logs into the computer.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there are no known weaknesses that could allow a victim to\nrecover their files for free.\n\n## How to protect yourself from the Velso Ransomware\n\nTo protect yourself from the Velso Ransomware, it is particularly important that you do not\nhave any computers running remote desktop services connected directly to the Internet.\nInstead place computers running remote desktop behind VPNs so that they are only\naccessible to those who have VPN accounts on your network.\n\nIn order to protect yourself from ransomware in general, it is important that you use good\ncomputing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a\nreliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such\nas a ransomware attack.\n\nYou should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat\nransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft Anti[Malware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\nmany, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.\n\nLast, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases\nare the most important steps of all:\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them\n\n\n-----\n\n[Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload)\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure\nyou update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs\ncontain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.\nTherefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral\ndetections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your\nwilling to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\n\nFor a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a\nComputer against Ransomware article.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Server Hashes:\n```\nSHA256: 4c8cf7ce3836edceb540edeccae97ef182331f6ed93e678d2e33105d01e809bf\n\n Filenames associated with the Server Cryptomix Variant:\nget_my_files.txt\n\n Server Ransom Note Text:\nHello.
