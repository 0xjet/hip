The sectors targeted by this](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/iranian-supergroup-muddywater.html)\nadvanced persistent threat actor include national and local governments and ministries,\nuniversities and private entities such as telecommunication providers.\n\n\n-----\n\nTalos researchers observed several instances of maldocs, specifically XLS files, distributed\nby the APT MuddyWater. These XLS files were observed targeting the Arabian Peninsula\nthrough a recent phishing campaign.\n\nThe documents consist of a malicious macro that, when triggered, drops two WSF files on\nthe endpoint.\n\n\"One of these scripts is the instrumentor script meant to execute the next stage. This\ninstrumentor script is placed in the current user's Startup folder by the VBA macro to\nestablish persistence across reboots,\" the researchers say. \"The second script is a WSFbased RAT we call \"SloughRAT\" that can execute arbitrary commands on the infected\nendpoint. This RAT consists of obfuscated code from interweaved Visual Basic and\nJavaScript.\"\n\nMuddyWater has been active since at least 2017 and is also known as MERCURY or Static\nKitten. U.S. Cyber Command has attributed the APT group to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence\nand Security (see: _[MuddyWater Targets Critical Infrastructure in Asia, Europe).](https://www.databreachtoday.asia/muddywater-targets-critical-infrastructure-in-asia-europe-a-18611)_\n\nThe group is known for conducting espionage campaigns against high-value targets in North\nAmerica, Europe and Asia.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe researchers found that the group is using maldocs to deliver a Windows script file-based\nremote access Trojan, which Cisco Talos researchers call \"SloughRAT,\" an implant known as\n\"Canopy\" in CISA's most recent [alert from February 2022 about MuddyWater.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/02/24/iranian-government-sponsored-muddywater-actors-conducting)\n\nThe obfuscated Trojan also attempts to execute arbitrary code and commands received from\nits command and control servers. The researchers say that their investigation led to the\ndiscovery of the use of two additional script-based implants: one written in Visual Basic\nduring 2021-2022 and one written in JavaScript in 2019-2020, which also downloads and\nruns arbitrary commands on the victim's system.\n\nMuddyWater also relies heavily on the use of DNS to contact their C2 servers, while the\ninitial contact with the hosting servers is conducted via HTTP.\n\n\"Their initial payloads usually use PowerShell, Visual Basic and JavaScript scripting along\nwith living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) and remote connection utilities to assist in the initial\nstages of the infection,\" the researchers say. \"The attackers attempted to deploy the\nConnectwise Remote Access client on the target's endpoints, a tactic commonly used by\nMuddyWater to gain an initial foothold on targets' endpoints.\"\n\nCisco Talos researchers say that the attackers deployed a RAT in April 2021 and the EXEbased infection vector from August 2021; the maldocs and decoy documents reached out to\na common server to download a common image file that links them.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese campaigns used a homemade implementation of signaling tokens. In this case, the\nmaldocs have an external entity downloaded from an attacker-controller server. This entity\nconsists in a simple image which has no malicious content,\" say Cisco Talos researchers\nAsheer Malhotra, Vitor Ventura, and Arnaud Zobec.\n\nThey say this may be a way for the attackers to track the initial infection vectors and identify\nwhich is more successful. The researchers say it is likely that the attackers used this server\nas a token tracker to keep track of successful infections in this campaign.\n\n\"This token-tracking system was then migrated to CanaryTokens in September 2021 in the\nattacks targeting Turkey using the malicious Excel documents,\" the researchers say.\n\nIn addition, during the tracing of MuddyWater's activity over the past year, the researchers\nsay that they saw some of the shared techniques are refined from one region to the other,\nsuggesting the teams use their preferred flavors of tools of choice, including final payloads.\n\nEarlier, the researchers disclosed two campaigns using the same types of Windows\nexecutables targeting Turkey in November 2021 and Armenia in June 2021.\n\n\"Another campaign illustrated previously used similar executables, this time to target\nPakistan. This campaign deployed a PowerShell-based downloader on the endpoint to\naccept and execute additional PS1 commands from the C2 server. Going further back, in\nApril 2021, we observed another instance of Muddywater targeting entities in Pakistan, this\ntime with a maldoc-based infection vector. The lure document claimed to be part of a court\ncase,\" the researchers say.\n\n## Is MuddyWater a Conglomerate?\n\nThe Cisco Talos report says MuddyWater's variety of lures and payloads and its targeting of\nseveral different geographic regions strengthens the growing hypothesis that MuddyWater is\na conglomerate of subgroups rather than a single actor.\n\n\"These sub-groups have conducted campaigns against a variety of industries. While these\nteams seem to operate independently, they are all motivated by the same factors that align\nwith Iranian national security objectives, including espionage, intellectual theft, and\ndestructive or disruptive operations based on the victims they target,\" the researchers say.\n\n\n-----\n\nMuddyWater teams appear to share TTPs\nCisco Talos researchers analyzed a variety of campaigns that are marked by the\ndevelopment and use of distinct infection vectors and tools to gain entry, establish long-term\naccess, siphon valuable information and monitor their targets. But the MuddyWater teams\nappear to share TTPs, as evidenced by the incremental adoption of various techniques over\ntime in different MuddyWater campaigns.\n\n\"We believe there are links between these different campaigns, including the migration of\ntechniques from region to region, along with their evolution into more advanced versions.\nOverall, the campaigns we describe cover Turkey, Pakistan, Armenia and countries from the\nArabian Peninsula,\" researchers say.\n\n\n-----",
