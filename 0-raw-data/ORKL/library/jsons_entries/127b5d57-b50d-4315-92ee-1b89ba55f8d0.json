The threat actors associated with DRAGONFISH have previously focused their campaigns on targets in Southeast Asia, specifically those located in countries near the South China Sea. These attacks have mainly targeted high-profile government, military and political institutions, but other victims include those operating in the education and telecommunication industries. iDefense analysts have identified a campaign likely to be targeting members of— or those with affiliation or interest in—the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM).\n\n\nThis threat analysis provides security operations center (SOC) analysts and engineers\nwith detailed information pertaining to the workings of the Elise malware family and\nthe indicators of compromise (IoCs) to assist them in their own independent analyses.\n\nThis threat analysis will help to inform organizations and support their decision\nmaking on how to better contain or mitigate the threat through monitoring or\nblocking.\n\nThey may consider using the information to inform hunting activities for systems that\nmay already have been compromised, or by using the IoCs by adding them to hunting\nlists or endpoint detection & response (EDR) solutions as well as to network- and host-\nbased backlists to detect and deny malware implantation—and command and control\n(C2) communication—or whatever mitigations they determine are most appropriate\nfor their environments.\n\nGiven the inherent nature of threat intelligence, it is based on information gathered\nand understood at a specific point in time.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TECHNICAL REPORT\n\n\n###### DESCRIPTION\n\niDefense analysts have identified a campaign likely to be targeting members of or\nthose with affiliation or interest in the ASEAN Defence Minister’s Meeting (ADMM).\niDefense assesses with high confidence that this campaign is associated with the\nthreat group DRAGONFISH (also known as Lotus Blossom and Spring Dragon).\n\n**MALWARE ANALYSIS**\n\nKnowledge of DRAGONFISH's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) helps to\nbetter inform detection and response to attacks by this threat group.\n\nThe sample iDefense identified is a malicious Microsoft Corp. Word document (see\nExhibit 1) with the following properties:\n\n  - **MD5: f12fc711529b48bcef52c5ca0a52335a**\n\n  - **Author: mary**\n\n  - **Last Modified by: mary**\n\n  - **Created Time Stamp: 2018:01:19 14:56:00 (Jan. 19, 2018, 2:56 p.m.)**\n\n  - **Last Modified Time Stamp: 2018:01:19 14:56:00 (JAn. 19, 2018, 2:56 p.m.)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 1: Decoy Document**\n\nThe Word document, which includes information on ADMM-Plus members, has a\nmalicious executable file embedded as an OLE object (see Exhibit 2).\n\n**Exhibit 2: Original Source Path**\n\nThe embedded file named a.b is dropped to the %temp% folder once the Word\ndocument is opened and is executed by exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability.\nThe payload is consequently moved to\n\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Caches\\ as a file named NavShExt.dll and the\nexecutable a.b is deleted.\n\nThis file NavShExt.dll is a PE32 dynamic-link library (DLL), and the filename suggests\nthat the malware author intended to disguise the file as a legitimate Symantec Corp.\nanti-virus component called the Norton Security Shell Extension Module.\n\nThe DLL has the following properties:\n\n  - MD5 Hash: cd36bbd7f949cf017edba0e6aaadf28c\n\n  - Compile Time: 2018-01-12 17:59:58 (Jan. 12, 2018, 5:59 p.m.)\n\n  - Export Function: Setting\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware performs the following set of actions:\n\n1. Starts iexplore.exe (Internet Explorer) in a suspended state\n\n2. Injects NavShExt.dll into the iexplore.exe process and calls the DLL\nexport Setting function\n\n3. The iexplore.exe process continues to run in the background\n\n4. Creates a mutex named donotbotherme (see Exhibit 3) to avoid having\nduplicated executions\n\n5. Creates a file named thumbcache_1CD60.db in\n\nAppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer\\ where the harvested data is\nstored\n\n6. Sends data to and downloads files and commands from the designated C2\nserver\n\n7. Harvests extensive system information from the machine, such as the\nfollowing:\n\n    - LAN and WAN IP addresses (for the latter, it uses the free IP address\nservice ipaddress.com)\n\n    - Proxy information\n\n    - Installed software list\n\n    - Process enumeration via tasklist\n\n    - List of all the files on the user’s desktop\n\n**Exhibit 3: Mutex Creation**\n\nBased on the currently available intelligence we also believe the malware is capable\nof providing the attacker with a remote shell on the host and can completely uninstall\nitself.\n\nExecution debug messages are stored in the %temp% folder in a file named\nFXSAPIDebugLogFile.tmp. Example messages include Client Start!, indicating a\n\n\n-----\n\nsuccessful infection, or an error message such as [2018-1-25 13:35:22] Try All Addr\nFailed! Sleep For: 10.100000 Minutes!, indicating that the C2 sever cannot be reached\nand the malware will sleep for a fixed amount of time.\n\nLogs are encrypted using the following static AES key:\nSs)4:WKsRr(3/VJrQq&2.UIqPp%1-THp.\n\nOf particular interest is an embedded, custom application in a .data section that is\nresponsible for loading and executing executables and DLLs from inside the main\nbinary. The application supports the following command-line options:\n\n  - runexe 1.exe /c command…\n\n  - rundll 1.dll, DllMain\n\nWhen attempting to find more information about this application, iDefense\ndiscovered a file with the MD5 hash cfa7954722d4277d26e96edc3289a4ce, which\nfeatures the same application and was mentioned in a 2015 report titled Operation\n_Lotus Blossom by the Unit42 team at partner organization Palo Alto Networks._\n\nSeveral observations detailed in this report on Elise variant C align with the findings\ndisclosed above:\n\n  - Similar targeting of Southeast Asia\n\n  - Same export function name in the dropper DLL: Setting\n\n  - Identical custom application to load and execute EXEs or DLLs\n\n  - Heavy anti-virtual-machine features\n\n  - Similar obfuscation techniques used to exfiltrate data to C2 server (using\nbase64-encoded cookie values)\n\nIn contrast to the earlier campaigns, debug paths are completely stripped.\nPersistence is achieved using the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD:\n\n  - HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\IAStorD\n\nAs mentioned earlier, two hidden DLLs can be discovered that are additionally\ninjected into iexplore.exe and have the export functions named DePatchEntry\nor EvilEntry. These DLLs provide additional loading and other anti-analysis\nfunctionalities.\n\nThe malware attempts to spoof the host and query non-existing domains, such as the\nfollowing:\n\n  - 3qyo4o7.7r7i3[.]info\n\n  - dtdf5vu.nt7yq[.]info\n\n  - j.4tc3ldw.g9ml.www0[.]org\n\n  - 38qmk6.0to9[.]info\n\n  - ubkv1t.ec0[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n  - 7g91xhp.envuy3[.]net\n\n  - l.hovux.eln9wj7.7gpj[.]org\n\n  - w.7sytdjc.wroi.cxy[.]com\n\nThis is likely done to throw off malware analysts or network administrators. The real\nC2 server, 103.236.150[.]14, is actually hardcoded (see Exhibit 4).\n\n**Exhibit 4: Real C2 Server Hardcoded in the Malware**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate the threat of the described campaign, security teams can consider\nblocking access to the C2 server 103.236.150[.]14 and, where applicable, ensure that\nthe Microsoft Security Update KB2553204 is installed in order to patch the CVE-201711882 vulnerability.\n\nFor threat hunting, iDefense also suggests that analysts to look for the following\nartifacts:\n\n  - A value named IAStorD in the autorun key\n\n  - A file named FXSAPIDebugLogFile.tmp\n\n  - A mutex handle named donotbotherme\n\n  - thumbcache_1CD60.db in AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer\\\n\nFor further information regarding the Microsoft Security Update KB25533204, please\nvisit:\n\n[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2553204/description-of-the-security-](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2553204/description-of-the-security-update-for-office-2010-november-14-2017)\n[update-for-office-2010-november-14-2017](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2553204/description-of-the-security-update-for-office-2010-november-14-2017)\n\nGiven the inherent nature of threat intelligence, the content contained in this alert is\nbased on information gathered and understood at the time of its creation.
