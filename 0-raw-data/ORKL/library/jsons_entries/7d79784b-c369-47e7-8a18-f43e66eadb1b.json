FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence has](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage/threat-intelligence)\npreviously documented this threat in our investigations of trends across ransomware\nincidents, [FIN6 activity,](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pick-six-intercepting-a-fin6-intrusion) [implications for OT networks, and other aspects of post-compromise](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/ransomware-against-machine-learning-to-disrupt-industrial-production)\nransomware deployment. Since November 2019, we’ve seen the MAZE ransomware being\nused in attacks that combine targeted ransomware use, public exposure of victim data, and\nan affiliate model.\n\nMalicious actors have been actively deploying MAZE ransomware since at least May 2019.\nThe ransomware was initially distributed via spam emails and exploit kits before later shifting\nto being deployed post-compromise. Multiple actors are involved in MAZE ransomware\noperations, based on our observations of alleged users in underground forums and distinct\ntactics, techniques, and procedures across Mandiant incident response engagements.\nActors behind MAZE also maintain a public-facing website where they post data stolen from\nvictims who refuse to pay an extortion fee.\n\nThe combination of these two damaging intrusion outcomes—dumping sensitive data and\ndisrupting enterprise networks—with a criminal service makes MAZE a notable threat to\nmany organizations. This blog post is based on information derived from numerous Mandiant\nincident response engagements and our own research into the MAZE ecosystem and\noperations.\n\nMandiant Threat Intelligence will be available to answer questions on the MAZE ransomware\nthreat in a May 21 webinar.\n\n**Victimology**\n\nWe are aware of more than 100 alleged MAZE victims reported by various media outlets and\non the MAZE website since November 2019. These organizations have been primarily based\nin North America, although victims spanned nearly every geographical region. Nearly every\nindustry sector including manufacturing, legal, financial services, construction, healthcare,\ntechnology, retail, and government has been impacted demonstrating that indiscriminate\nnature of these operations (Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\nGeographical and industry distribution of alleged MAZE victims\n\n\nFigure 1: Geographical and industry distribution of alleged MAZE victims\n\n**Multiple Actors Involved in MAZE Ransomware Operations Identified**\n\nMandiant identified multiple Russian-speaking actors who claimed to use MAZE ransomware\nand were seeking partners to fulfill different functional roles within their teams. Additional\n[information on these actors is available to Mandiant Intelligence subscribers. A panel used to](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage/threat-intelligence/subscribe)\nmanage victims targeted for MAZE ransomware deployment has a section for affiliate\ntransactions. This activity is consistent with our assessment that MAZE operates under an\naffiliate model and is not distributed by a single group. Under this business model,\nransomware developers will partner with other actors (i.e. affiliates) who are responsible for\ndistributing the malware. In these scenarios, when a victim pays the ransom demand, the\nransomware developers receive a commission. Direct affiliates of MAZE ransomware also\npartner with other actors who perform specific tasks for a percentage of the ransom\npayment. This includes partners who provide initial access to organizations and pentesters\n\n\n-----\n\nwho are responsible for reconnaissance, privilege escalation and lateral movement—each of\nwhich who appear to work on a percentage-basis. Notably, in some cases, actors may be\nhired on a salary basis (vs commission) to perform specific tasks such as determining the\nvictim organization and its annual revenues. This allows for specialization within the cyber\ncriminal ecosystem, ultimately increasing efficiency, while still allowing all parties involved to\nprofit.\n\n\nMAZE ransomware panel\n\n\nFigure 2: MAZE ransomware panel\n\n**MAZE Initially Distributed via Exploit Kits and Spam Campaigns**\n\n[MAZE ransomware was initially distributed directly via exploit kits and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-says-computer-type-determines-ransom-amount/) [spam campaigns](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta2101-plays-government-imposter-distribute-malware-german-italian-and-us)\nthrough late 2019. For example, in November 2019, Mandiant observed multiple email\ncampaigns delivering Maze ransomware primarily to individuals at organizations in Germany\nand the United States, although a significant number of emails were also delivered to entities\n\n\n-----\n\nin Canada, Italy, and South Korea. These emails used tax, invoice, and package delivery\nthemes with document attachments or inline links to documents which download and\nexecute Maze ransomware.\n\nOn November 6 and 7, a Maze campaign targeting Germany delivered macro-laden\ndocuments using the subject lines “Wichtige informationen uber Steuerruckerstattung” and\n“1&1 Internet AG - Ihre Rechnung 19340003422 vom 07.11.19” (Figure 3). Recipients\nincluded individuals at organizations in a wide range of industries, with the Financial\nServices, Healthcare, and Manufacturing sectors being targeted most frequently. These\nemails were sent using a number of malicious domains created with the registrant address\ngladkoff1991@yandex.ru.\n\n\nGerman-language lure\n\n\nFigure 3: German-language lure\n\n\n-----\n\nOn November 8, a campaign delivered Maze primarily to Financial Services and Insurance\norganizations located in the United states. These emails originated from a compromised or\nspoofed account and contained an inline link to download a Maze executable payload.\n\nOn November 18 and 19, a Maze campaign targeted individuals operating in a range of\nindustries in the United States and Canada with macro documents using phone bill and\npackage delivery themes (Figure 4 and Figure 5). These emails used the subjects “Missed\npackage delivery” and \"Your AT&T wireless bill is ready to view\" and were sent using a\nnumber of malicious domains with the registrant address abusereceive@hitler.rocks.\nNotably, this registrant address was also used to create multiple Italian-language domains\ntowards the end of November 2019.\n\n\nAT&T email lure\n\n\nFigure 4: AT&T email lure\n\n\n-----\n\nCanada Post email lure\n\n\nFigure 5: Canada Post email lure\n\n**Shift to Post-Compromise Distribution Maximizes Impact**\n\nActors using MAZE have increasingly shifted to deploying the ransomware post-compromise.\nThis methodology provides an opportunity to infect more hosts within a victim’s environment\nand exfiltrate data, which is leveraged to apply additional pressure on organizations to pay\nextortion fees. Notably, in at least some cases, the actors behind these operations charge an\nadditional fee, in addition to the decryption key, for the non-release of stolen data.\n\nAlthough the high-level intrusion scenarios preceding the distribution of MAZE ransomware\nare broadly similar, there have been notable variations across intrusions that suggest\nattribution to distinct teams. Even within these teams, the cyber criminals appear to be taskoriented meaning that one operator is not responsible for the full lifecycle. The following\nsections highlight the TTPs seen in a subset of incidents and serve to illustrate the\n\n\n-----\n\ndivergence that may occur due to the fact that numerous, disparate actors are involved in\ndifferent phases of these operations. Notably, the time between initial compromise to\nencryption has also been widely varied, from weeks to many months.\n\n_Initial Compromise_\n\nThere are few clear patterns for intrusion vector across analyzed MAZE ransomware\nincidents. This is consistent with our observations of multiple actors who use MAZE soliciting\npartners with network access. The following are a sample of observations from several\nMandiant incident response engagements:\n\nA user downloaded a malicious resume-themed Microsoft Word document that\ncontained macros which launched an IcedID payload, which was ultimately used to\nexecute an instance of BEACON.\nAn actor logged into an internet-facing system via RDP. The account used to grant\ninitial access was a generic support account. It is unclear how the actor obtained the\naccount's password.\nAn actor exploited a misconfiguration on an Internet-facing system. This access\nenabled the actor to deploy tools to pivot into the internal network.\nAn actor logged into a Citrix web portal account with a weak password. This\nauthenticated access enabled the actor to launch a Meterpreter payload on an internal\nsystem.\n\n_Establish Foothold & Maintain Presence_\n\nThe use of legitimate credentials and broad distribution of BEACON across victim\nenvironments appear to be consistent approaches used by actors to establish their foothold\nin victim networks and to maintain presence as they look to meet their ultimate objective of\ndeploying MAZE ransomware. Despite these commonplace behaviors, we have observed an\nactor create their own domain account to enable latter-stage operations.\n\nAcross multiple incidents, threat actors deploying MAZE established a foothold in victim\nenvironments by installing BEACON payloads on many servers and workstations.\nWeb shells were deployed to an internet-facing system. The system level access\ngranted by these web shells was used to enable initial privilege escalation and the\nexecution of a backdoor.\nIntrusion operators regularly obtained and maintained access to multiple domain and\nlocal system accounts with varying permissions that were used throughout their\noperations.\nAn actor created a new domain account and added it to the domain administrators\ngroup.\n\n_Escalate Privileges_\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough Mandiant has observed multiple cases where MAZE intrusion operators employed\nMimikatz to collect credentials to enable privilege escalation, these efforts have also been\nbolstered in multiple cases via use of Bloodhound, and more manual searches for files\ncontaining credentials.\n\nLess than two weeks after initial access, the actor downloaded and interacted with an\narchive named mimi.zip, which contained files corresponding to the credential\nharvesting tool Mimikatz. In the following days the same mimi.zip archive was identified\non two domain controllers in the impacted environment.\nThe actor attempted to find files with the word “password” within the environment.\nAdditionally, several archive files were also created with file names suggestive of\ncredential harvesting activity.\nThe actor attempted to identify hosts running the KeePass password safe software.\nAcross multiple incidents, the Bloodhound utility was used, presumably to assess\npossible methods of obtaining credentials with domain administrator privileges.\nActors primarily used Procdump and Mimikatz to collect credentials used to enable\nlater stages of their intrusion. Notably, both Bloodhound and PingCastle were also\nused, presumably to enable attackers' efforts to understand the impacted organization's\nActive Directory configuration. In this case the responsible actors also attempted to\nexfiltrate collected credentials to multiple different cloud file storage services.\n\n_Reconnaissance_\n\nMandiant has observed a broad range of approaches to network, host, data, and Active\nDirectory reconnaissance across observed MAZE incidents. The varied tools and\napproaches across these incidents maybe best highlights the divergent ways in which the\nresponsible actors interact with victim networks.\n\nIn some intrusions, reconnaissance activity occurred within three days of gaining initial\naccess to the victim network. The responsible actor executed a large number of\nreconnaissance scripts via Cobalt Strike to collect network, host, filesystem, and\ndomain related information.\nMultiple built-in Windows commands were used to enable network, account, and host\nreconnaissance of the impacted environment, though the actors also supplied and\nused Advanced IP Scanner and Adfind to support this stage of their operations.\nPreliminary network reconnaissance has been conducted using a batch script named\n'2.bat' which contained a series of nslookup commands. The output of this script was\ncopied into a file named '2.txt'.\nThe actor exfiltrated reconnaissance command output data and documents related to\nthe IT environment to an attacker-controlled FTP server via an encoded PowerShell\nscript.\nOver a period of several days, an actor conducted reconnaissance activity using\nBloodhound, PowerSploit/PowerView (Invoke-ShareFinder), and a reconnaissance\nscript designed to enumerate directories across internal hosts\n\n\n-----\n\nAn actor employed the adfind tool and a batch script to collect information about their\nnetwork, hosts, domain, and users. The output from this batch script (2adfind.bat) was\nsaved into an archive named 'ad.7z' using an instance of the 7zip archiving utility\nnamed 7.exe.\nAn actor used the tool smbtools.exe to assess whether accounts could login to systems\nacross the environment.\nAn actor collected directory listings from file servers across an impacted environment.\nEvidence of data exfiltration was observed approximately one month later, suggesting\nthat the creation of these directory listings may have been precursor activity, providing\nthe actors with data they may have used to identify sensitive data for future exfiltration.\n\n_Lateral Movement_\n\nAcross the majority of MAZE ransomware incidents lateral movement was accomplished via\nCobalt Strike BEACON and using previously harvested credentials. Despite this uniformity,\nsome alternative tools and approaches were also observed.\n\nAttackers relied heavily on Cobalt Strike BEACON to move laterally across the\nimpacted environment, though they also tunneled RDP using the ngrok utility, and\nemployed tscon to hijack legitimate rdp sessions to enable both lateral movement and\nprivilege escalation.\nThe actor moved laterally throughout some networks leveraging compromised service\nand user accounts obtained from the system on which they gained their initial foothold.\nThis allowed them to obtain immediate access to additional systems. Stolen credentials\nwere then used to move laterally across the network via RDP and to install BEACON\npayloads providing the actors with access to nearly one hundred hosts.\nAn actor moved laterally using Metasploit and later deployed a Cobalt Strike payload to\na system using a local administrator account.\nAt least one actor attempted to perform lateral movement using EternalBlue in early\nand late 2019; however, there is no evidence that these attempts were successful.\n\n_Complete Mission_\n\nThere was evidence suggesting data exfiltration across most analyzed MAZE ransomware\nincidents. While malicious actors could monetize stolen data in various way (e.g. sale in an\nunderground forum, fraud), actors employing MAZE are known to threaten the release of\nstolen data if victim organizations do not pay an extortion fee.\n\nAn actor has been observed exfiltrating data to FTP servers using a base64-encoded\nPowerShell script designed to upload any files with .7z file extensions to a predefined\nFTP server using a hard-coded username and password. This script appears to be a\nslight variant of a [script first posted to Microsoft TechNet in 2013.](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/80647f66-139c-40a4-bb7a-04a2d73d423c#content))\nA different base64-encoded PowerShell command was also used to enable this\nfunctionality in a separate incident.\n\n\n-----\n\nActors deploying MAZE ransomware have also used the utility WinSCP to exfiltrate\ndata to an attacker-controlled FTP server.\nAn actor has been observed employing a file replication utility and copying the stolen\ndata to a cloud file hosting/sharing service.\nPrior to deploying MAZE ransomware threat actors employed the 7zip utility to archive\ndata from across various corporate file shares. These archives were then exfiltrated to\nan attacker-controlled server via FTP using the WinSCP utility.\n\nIn addition to data theft, actors deploy MAZE ransomware to encrypt files identified on the\nvictim network. Notably, the aforementioned MAZE panel has an option to specify the date\non which ransom demands will double, likely to create a sense of urgency to their demands.\n\nFive days after data was exfiltrated from a victim environment the actor copied a MAZE\nransomware binary to 15 hosts within the victim environment and successfully\nexecuted it on a portion of these systems.\nAttackers employed batch scripts and a series to txt files containing host names to\ndistribute and execute MAZE ransomware on many servers and workstations across\nthe victim environment.\nAn actor deployed MAZE ransomware to tens of hosts, explicitly logging into each\nsystem using a domain administrator account created earlier in the intrusion.\nImmediately following the exfiltration of sensitive data, the actors began deployment of\nMAZE ransomware to hosts across the network. In some cases, thousands of hosts\nwere ultimately encrypted. The encryption process proceeded as follows:\n\nA batch script named start.bat was used to execute a series of secondary batch\nscripts with names such as xaa3x.bat or xab3x.bat.\nEach of these batch scripts contained a series of commands that employed the\ncopy command, WMIC, and PsExec to copy and execute a kill script\n(windows.bat) and an instance of MAZE ransomware (sss.exe) on hosts across\nthe impacted environment\nNotably, forensic analysis of the impacted environment revealed MAZE\ndeployment scripts targeting ten times as many hosts as were ultimately\nencrypted.\n\n**Implications**\n\nBased on our belief that the MAZE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we\nanticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will\ncontinue to vary somewhat, particularly in terms of the initial intrusion vector.
