cyberattack\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransom-x-ransomware-used-in-texas-txdot-cyberattack/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransom-x-ransomware-used-in-texas-txdot-cyberattack/)**\n\nLawrence Abrams\n\nBy\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nJune 26, 2020\n10:17 AM\n4\n\nA new ransomware called Ransom X is being actively used in human-operated and\ntargeted attacks against government agencies and enterprises.\n\nMay 2020 was not a good month for Texas as both the [Texas Courts and the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-courts-hit-by-ransomware-network-disabled-to-limit-spread/) Texas\nDepartment of Transportation (TxDOT) were hit with ransomware attacks.\n\nAt the time of the attacks, it was not known what ransomware targeted the government\nagencies.\n\nWe still do not know for the Texas Courts, but due to a ransomware sample found\nby [MalwareHunterTeam, we now know that TxDot suffered an attack by new targeted](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nransomware called Ransom X.\n\n## Taking a look at Ransom X\n\nAfter MalwareHunterTeam shared a sample of Ransom X with Advanced Intel's Vitali\nKremez and BleepingComputer, we took it for a spin to see what we could find.\n\n\n-----\n\nNaming ransomware infections is not always easy, as many times, there is no indication as\nto what the developers call it.\n\nIn this case, Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez found a 'ransom.exx' string in the executable,\nwhich we believe is the name of the ransomware.\n\nAs this is human-operated ransomware, rather than one distributed via phishing or\nmalware, when executed the ransomware will open a console that displays information to\nthe attacker while it is running.\n\n**Ransom X console**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nAccording to Kremez, Ransom.exx will terminate 289 processes related to security\nsoftware, database servers, MSP software, remote access tools, and mail servers.\n\nThe ransomware will also bypass various Windows system folders and any files that match\nthe follow extensions:\n```\n.ani, .cab, .cpl, .cur, .diagcab, .diagpkg, .dll, .drv, .hlp, .icl, .icns, .ico,\n.iso, .ics, .lnk, .idx, .mod, .mpa, .msc, .msp, .msstyles, .msu, .nomedia, .ocx,\n.prf, .rtp, .scr, .shs, .spl, .sys, .theme, .themepack, .exe, .bat, .cmd, .url, .mui\n\n```\nOf particular interest are three bypassed folders that Kremez and I theorize are being used\nto store the ransomware executable and other utilities used during an attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ncrypt_detect\ncryptolocker\nransomware\n\n```\nBy bypassing these folders, it allows the attackers to encrypt a computer while also attack\nother computers on the network without fear their tools will become encrypted.\n\nThe list of terminated processes and bypassed extensions and folders can be found on our\n[GitHub page.](https://github.com/Bleeping/Ransom.exx)\n\nRansom X will also perform a series of commands throughout the encryption process that:\n\nClear Windows event logs\nDelete NTFS journals\nDisable System Restore\nDisable the Windows Recovery Environment\nDelete Windows backup catalogs\nWipe free space from local drives.\n\nThe commands executed are listed below.\n```\ncipher /w %s\nwbadmin.exe delete catalog -quiet\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\nschtasks.exe /Change /TN \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SystemRestore\\SR\" /disable\nwevtutil.exe cl Application\nwevtutil.exe cl System\nwevtutil.exe cl Setup\nwevtutil.exe cl Security\nwevtutil.exe sl Security /e:false\nfsutil.exe usn deletejournal /D C:\n\n```\nThe ransomware will now begin to encrypt all of the data on the computer and append a\ncustom extension associated with the victim to each encrypted file.\n\nAs you can see below, the custom extension for the Texas Department of Transportation\nattack was .txd0t.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransom X encrypted files**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nWhen completed, the Ransom X console will display the number of encrypted files and how\nlong it took to complete it.\n\n**Encryption has finished**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\n\n\n-----\n\nIn each folder that was scanned during the encryption process, a ransom note named !\n\n[extension]_READ_ME!.txt will be created.\n\nThis ransom note includes the company name, an email address to contact, and\ninstructions on how to pay the ransom.\n\nAs you can see below, the ransom note is customized for the specific victim that is under\nattack, which in this case is the Texas Department of Transportation.\n\n**Ransom X ransom note**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nDue to the limited visibility into this ransomware operation, there is no information regarding\nthe ransom amounts or whether they steal data as part of the attacks.\n\nThis ransomware has been analyzed and appears secure, which means there is no way to\ndecrypt the files for free.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Luxury fashion house Zegna confirms August ransomware
