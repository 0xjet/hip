Patchwork threat actors utilized a pair of EPS exploits rolled into\n[legitimate, albeit malicious, documents in order to propagate their updated BADNEWS](https://www.forcepoint.com/sites/default/files/resources/files/forcepoint-security-labs-monsoon-analysis-report.pdf)\npayload. The use of weaponized legitimate documents is a longstanding operational\nstandard of this group.\n\nThe malicious documents seen in recent activity refer to a number of topics, including recent\nmilitary promotions within the Pakistan Army, information related to the Pakistan Atomic\nEnergy Commission, as well as Pakistan’s Ministry of the Interior.\n\nThe BADNEWS malware payload, which these malicious documents ultimately deliver, has\n[been updated since the last public report in December 2017. BADNEWS acts as a backdoor](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/tech-brief-untangling-the-patchwork-cyberespionage-group.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nfor the attackers, providing them with full control over the victim machine. It has historically\nleveraged legitimate third-party websites to host the malware’s command and control (C2)\ninformation, acting as “dead drops”. After the C2 information has been collected, BADNEWS\nleverages HTTP for communication with the remote servers.\nWe’ve observed modifications to how the malware obtains its (C2) server information, as well\nas modifications to the C2 communication. These changes to BADNEWS, as well as the use\nof recent EPS-based exploits, demonstrate that the group are actively updating their toolsets\nin efforts to stay ahead of the security community.\nIn this posting, we detail our findings and document these changes.\n\nDelivery\nThe malicious documents that Unit 42 examined contained legitimate decoy lures as well as\n[malicious embedded EPS files targeting the CVE-2015-2545 and](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2015-2545) [CVE-2017-0261](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0261)\nvulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are well covered in previous public works, which can be\nfound from [PWC and](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/05/exploring-cve-2015-2545-and-its-users.html) [FireEye. Older documents used by Patchwork focused on the CVE-](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/eps-processing-zero-days.html)\n2017-0261 vulnerability, however in late January 2018 when, paradoxically, newer\ndocuments abandoned this vulnerability to attack the older CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability.\nThe lures are primarily documents of interest to Pakistani nuclear organizations and the\nPakistani military as can be seen in the images below:\n\n_Figure 1 Lure extracted from_\n_a67220bcf289af6a99a9760c05d197d09502c2119f62762f78523aa7cbc96ef1_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Lure extracted from_\n_07d5509988b1aa6f8d5203bc4b75e6d7be6acf5055831cc961a51d3e921f96bd_\n\n_Figure 3 Lure extracted from_\n_b8abf94017b159f8c1f0746dca24b4eeaf7e27d2ffa83ca053a87deb7560a571_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Lure extracted from_\n_d486ed118a425d902044fb7a84267e92b49169c24051ee9de41327ee5e6ac7c2 and_\n_fd8394b2ff9cd00380dc2b5a870e15183f1dc3bd82ca6ee58f055b44074c7fd4_\n\nThe payload from each of the malicious documents is an updated version of the BADNEWS\nmalware family. When the shellcode embedded within the malicious EPS is executed, the\nfollowing three files are dropped:\n\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\VMwareCplLauncher.exe\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\vmtools.dll\n%PROGRAMDATA%\\Microsoft\\DeviceSync\\MSBuild.exe\n\nIn the list of dropped files, VMwareCplLauncher.exe is a legitimate, signed VMware\nexecutable that serves to ultimately deliver the BADNEWS payload. The vmtools.dll file is a\nmodified DLL that both ensures persistence and loads MSBuild.exe, which is the BADNEWS\nmalware renamed to spoof a legitimate Microsoft Visual Studio tool.\nAfter the files are dropped, the VMwareCplLauncher.exe executable is run, which in turn\nloads the vmtools.dll DLL file. This DLL file creates a scheduled task named\nBaiduUpdateTask1, which attempts to run the malicious, spoofed MSBuild.exe every\nsubsequent minute.\nThe technique of having a signed, legitimate, executable load a malicious library is\n[commonly referred to as side-loading, and has been witnessed in a number of campaigns](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1073)\n\n\n-----\n\nand malware families in the past.\nThe flow of execution from the time the victim opens the malicious Microsoft Word document,\nto the execution of BADNEWS, may be seen below:\n\n_Figure 5 Side-loading technique employed to deliver BADNEWS_\n\nThe following image demonstrates the scheduled task created by the modified vmtools.dll to\nensure BADNEWS runs and remains running on the victim machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Scheduled task created to load BADNEWS_\n\nBADNEWS\nMuch of BADNEWS has remained consistent from when it was originally discussed by\n[Forcepoint in August 2016. Additionally, recent analysis by Trend Micro notes some minor](https://www.forcepoint.com/sites/default/files/resources/files/forcepoint-security-labs-monsoon-analysis-report.pdf)\nchanges during 2017. To briefly recap, the BADNEWS malware family acts as a backdoor,\nwith communication occurring over HTTP. A number of commands are provided to the\nattackers, including the ability to download and execute additional information, upload\ndocuments of interest, and take screenshots of the desktop.\nThe malware collects C2 information when it is originally executed via “Dead Drop\nResolvers”. Dead drop resolvers have been used by multiple threat actor groups using\nvarious malware families and those behind Patchwork are well versed with this tactic. This\ntactic uses public web services to host content that contains encoded commands that are\ndecoded by the malware.\nFor the remainder of the analysis in this research blog, we are discussing the following file:\n\nSHA256 290ac98de80154705794e96d0c6d657c948b7dff7abf25ea817585e4c923adb2\n\nMD5 79ad2084b057847ce2ec2e48fda64073\n\n\nCompile\nDate\n\n\n2017-12-22 11:54:03 UTC\n\n\nOne of the first modifications we witnessed in this new variant of BADNEWS is a new mutex\nthat is created to ensure a single instance of BADNEWS is running at a given moment. This\nmalware family used the new mutex ‘com_mycompany_apps_appname_new’.\nThis variant of BADNEWS uses different filenames compared to previous versions. The\nfollowing filenames are used by BADNEWS throughout its execution. All of these files reside\nin the victim’s %TEMP% directory:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **Description**\n\n9PT568.dat Contains victim unique identifier\n\nTPX498.dat Keystroke logs\n\nedg499.dat List of interesting files\n\nTPX499.dat Temporarily holds screenshot when given command by C2\n\nup Temporarily contains downloaded file to be executed when given command\nby C2\n\nOther changes we noticed in this variant include how the malware obfuscates C2 information\nstored via dead drop resolvers. Previous variants of BADNEWS looked for data between ‘{{‘\nand ‘}}’, and used a simple cipher to decode this data. This new variant now looks for data\nbetween ‘[[‘ and ‘]]’ in a number of hardcoded URLs. This can be seen in the following\nimages taken from hxxp:// feeds.rapidfeeds[.]com/88604/, which is one of the dead drop\nresolvers we encountered in this sample:\n\n_Figure 7 Dead drop resolver used by BADNEWS_\n\nIn order to decrypt this data, the authors have included additional steps from previous\nversions. To decode this information, BADNEWS takes the following steps:\n\n1. Base64-decode the string\n2. Perform the decoding cipher used in previous versions\n3. Base64-decode the result\n4. Decrypt the result using the Blowfish algorithm and a static key\n\n\n-----\n\nA script, which is included in the Appendix, will decrypt data from these dead drop resolvers.\nIn the example shown above, we are presented with a result of 185.203.118[.]115 after all\nfour steps are taken.\nBADNEWS performs many of the expected functions associated with previous versions\nincluding keylogging and identifying files of interest. Unlike a previously reported variant, this\nversion of BADNEWS no longer looks at USB drives for interesting files. Instead, it looks at\nfixed drives only. It continues to seek out files with the following extensions:\n\n.xls\n.xlsx\n.doc\n.docx\n.ppt\n.pptx\n.pdf\n\nIn order to prepare for C2 communication, BADNEWS will aggregate various victim\ninformation, which is appended to two strings. These strings have the following format:\n\n1 uuid=[Victim ID]#un=[Username]#cn=[Hostname]#on=[OS Version]#lan=[IP\nAddress]#nop=#ver=1.0\n\n1 uuid=[Victim ID]#un=[Username]#\n\nAn example of the first string may be seen below:\n\n1 uuid=e29ac6c0-7037-11de-816d-806e6f6e696351c5#un=Josh Grunzweig#cn=WINLJLV2NKIOKP#on=mav6miv1#lan=192.168.217.141#nop=#ver=1.0\n\nIt should be noted that the variables used for this string are different from previous versions.\nFor example, in the previous variant of BADNEWS, the victim’s unique identifier was stored\nunder a variable named ‘uid’, the username was stored in a variable named ‘u’, etc.\nAdditionally, the hardcoded version string of ‘1.0’ is different from previous samples.\nC2 communication is also updated from prior versions, with the following commands now\nsupported by BADNEWS:\n\nCommand Description\n\n0 Kill BADNEWS.\n\n4 Upload edg499.dat, which includes the list of interesting files. Spawn a new\ninstance of BADNEWS after.\n\n5 Upload the file specified by the C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n8 Upload the TPX498.dat file, which contains the list of collected keystrokes.\n\n13 Copy file to adbFle.tmp, and upload it to the C2.\n\n23 Take screenshot, temporarily store it as TPX499.dat, and upload it to the C2.\n\n33 Download specified file to %TEMP%\\up and execute it in a new process\n\nDuring C2 communications, BADNEWS will communicate to the C2 previously identified via\nHTTP. The following hardcoded URI is used for normal communication with the C2 (note the\nadditional forward slashes):\n\n//e3e7e71a0b28b5e96cc492e636722f73//4sVKAOvu3D//ABDYot0NxyG.php\n\nIn the event data is uploaded to the attacker, the following hardcoded URI is used (note the\nuse of backslashes):\n\n\\e3e7e71a0b28b5e96cc492e636722f73\\4sVKAOvu3D\\UYEfgEpXAOE.php\n\nWhen initial pings are sent to the remote server, BADNEWS includes one of the two\npreviously created strings containing the victim’s information. An example request in a\nsandboxed environment may be seen below:\n\n_Figure 8 Example request made by BADNEWS_\n\nTo decrypt the data provided in the POST request, a number of steps are required. First, the\nattackers include a series of extra ‘=’ and ‘&’ characters within the data stream. Once these\nare removed, the data is decoded with base64. Finally, the result is decrypted using AES128 and the following static key (hex-encoded):\n\nDD1876848203D9E10ABCEEC07282FF37\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Patchwork group continues to plague victims located within the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough the use of relatively new exploits, as well as a constantly evolving malware toolset,\nthey aim to compromise prominent organizations and individuals to further their goals.\nRecent activity has shown a number of lures related to the Pakistan Army, the Pakistan\nAtomic Energy Commission, as well as the Ministry of the Interior.\nOne of the malware families tied to this group, BADNEWS, continues to be updated both in\nhow it uses dead drop resolvers, as well as how it communicates with a remote C2 server.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in a number of ways:\n\nTraps blocks the exploit documents witnessed during this campaign\nWildFire accurately identifies the samples mentioned in this blog as malicious\nThe [Patchwork and](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Patchwork) [BADNEWS tags in AutoFocus may be used for continued](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.BadNews)\nmonitoring and tracking of this threat.\n\nAdditionally, the providers being used for dead drops have been notified.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n**Malicious Word Document SHA256 Hashes**\na67220bcf289af6a99a9760c05d197d09502c2119f62762f78523aa7cbc96ef1\n07d5509988b1aa6f8d5203bc4b75e6d7be6acf5055831cc961a51d3e921f96bd\nfd8394b2ff9cd00380dc2b5a870e15183f1dc3bd82ca6ee58f055b44074c7fd4\nb8abf94017b159f8c1f0746dca24b4eeaf7e27d2ffa83ca053a87deb7560a571\nd486ed118a425d902044fb7a84267e92b49169c24051ee9de41327ee5e6ac7c2\n\n**BADNEWS SHA256 Hashes**\nab4f86a3144642346a3a40e500ace71badc06a962758522ca13801b40e9e7f4a\n290ac98de80154705794e96d0c6d657c948b7dff7abf25ea817585e4c923adb2\n\n**C2 Servers**\n185.203.118[.]115\n94.156.35[.]204\n\n**Dead Drop Resolvers**\nhxxp://feed43[.]com/8166706728852850.xml\nhxxp://feed43[.]com/3210021137734622.xml\nhxxp://www.webrss[.]com/createfeed.php?feedid=49966\nhxxp://feeds.rapidfeeds[.]com/88604/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Script to Decrypt Dead Drop Resolvers**\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n\n\nimport requests\nimport base64\nimport binascii\nimport re\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish\nfrom struct import pack\nrol = lambda val, r_bits, max_bits: (val << r_bits%max_bits) & (2**max_bits-1) | ((val\n& (2**max_bits-1)) >> (max_bits-(r_bits%max_bits)))\nror = lambda val, r_bits, max_bits: ((val & (2**max_bits-1)) >> r_bits%max_bits) | (val\n<< (max_bits-(r_bits%max_bits)) & (2**max_bits-1))\ndef unhexData(d):\nif len(d) % 2:\nd = d.zfill(len(d)+1)\nreturn ord(binascii.unhexlify(d))\ndef decodeDecrypt(data):\ndecdata = ''\nfor x in range(len(data)):\nx = x*2\nif x < len(data):\nc = unhexData(data[x])\nadd_num = unhexData(data[x+1])\nc = c << 4\nc = (c + add_num) & 0xff\nc ^= 0x23\nc = rol(c, 3, 8)\ndecdata += chr(c)\ndata2 = base64.b64decode(decdata)\nkey =\nbinascii.unhexlify(\"F0E1D2C3B4A5968778695A4B3C2D1E0F0011223344556677\")\ncipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)\ndec = cipher.decrypt(data2)\nreturn dec\nurls = [\n\"http://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/88604\"\n]\nfor d in urls:\nr = requests.get(d)\nbody = r.text\nr = re.search(\"\\[+\\s*([a-zA-Z0-9\\=]+)\\]+\", body)\nif r:\ndata = base64.b64decode(r.group(0))\nprint(\"[{}] Decrypted C2: {}\".format(d, decodeDecrypt(data).split(\"\\x00\")[0]))\n\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n\n-----\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
