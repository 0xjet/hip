(USA), a Los Angeles-based cybersecurity company providing managed\nthreat detection and response for Fortune 500's, identified threat actors leveraging Open\nRedirect Vulnerabilities popular in online services and apps to bypass spam filters to\nultimately deliver phishing content.\n\nUsing highly trusted service domains like Snapchat and other online-services, they create\nspecial URLs which lead to malicious resources with phishing kits. The kit identified is\nnamed LogoKit, which was previously used in attacks against the customers of Office 365,\nBank of America, GoDaddy, Virgin Fly, and many other major financial institutions and\nonline-services internationally.\n\nThe spike of LogoKit was been identified around the beginning of August, when multiple\nnew domain names impersonating popular services had been registered and leveraged\ntogether with Open Redirects. While LogoKit is known for a while in the underground, at\nleast since 2015, the cybercrime group behind it is constantly leveraging new tactics.\n\nLogoKit is known for its dynamic content generation using JavaScript – it is able to change\nlogos (of the impersonated service) and text on the landing pages in real-time to adapt on\nthe fly, by doing so the targeted victims are more likely to interact with the malicious\nresource. Around November 2021, there were over 700 identified domains names used in\ncampaigns leveraging LogoKit – their number is constantly growing.\n\nNotably, the actors prefer to use domain names in exotic jurisdictions or zones with\nrelatively poor abuse management process - .gq, .ml, .tk, ga, .cf or to gain unauthorized\naccess to legitimate WEB-resources, and then use them as hosting for further phishing\ndistribution.\n\nLogoKit relies on sending users phishing links that contain their email addresses. Once the\nvictim navigates to the URL, LogoKit fetches the company logo from a third-party service,\nsuch as Clearbit or Google's favicon database. The victim’s email is then auto filled in the\nemail or username field which consequently tricks them into feeling they’ve previously\nlogged in before. Should the victim then enter their password, LogoKit performs an AJAX\nrequest, sending the target's email and password to an external source, then finally\nredirecting the victim to their “legitimate” corporate website.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese tactics allow cybercriminals to masquerade their activity behind the notifications of\nlegitimate services to evade detection, thus tricking the victim into accessing the malicious\nresource. Unfortunately, the use of Open Redirect vulnerabilities significantly facilitates\nLogoKit distribution, as many (even popular) online-services don’t treat such bugs as\ncritical, and in some cases – don’t even patch, leaving the open door for such abuse.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how it works on the example of the campaign identified in July\n13th, it was targeting Office 365 users from the U.S. and Latin America:\n\nThis is an example of an email containing text and a link with an embedded link inside it\n\nThe embedded link is leveraging Open Redirect Vulnerability in Snapchat, and another\nURL from Google leading to a phishing resource:\n\nhttps://click[.]snapchat.com/aVHG?\n=http://29781.google.com&af_web_dp=http://bz.pn83f.parquedelprado.com.do.#.aHR0cH\nM6Ly9zdG9yYWdlYXBpLmZsZWVrLmNvLzBhZDkxYjFjLTk5OTQtNGExZC1iZjg4LTE4Y2\nYwN2RiYWY1Mi1idWNrZXQvY29udGludWUuaHRtbD8jY29udGFjdEByZXNlY3VyaXR5L\nmNvbQ==\n\nNotably, some of the observed anti-spam mechanisms don’t flag such links as malicious\nscoring them as trusted.\n\nOnce we decoded it, we found another link which contains the email address of the victim\nin question:\n\nhttps://storageapi.fleek[.]co/0ad91b1c-9994-4a1d-bf88-18cf07dbaf52bucket/continue.html?#contact@victim.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker used the Open Redirect in Snapchat to redirect the victim to new URL\nhttp://bz.pn83f.parquedelprado.com[.]do\n\nThe content of the pages generated by LogoKit is typically obfuscated.\n\nhttps://storageapi.fleek[.]co/0ad91b1c-9994-4a1d-bf88-18cf07dbaf52bucket/continue.html?#contact@victim.com\n\n\n-----\n\nHere you can see the code that deals with the Base64 portion of the attack.\n\nAnd here is the redirection part.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final page is leading to phishing impersonating Microsoft Office 365:\n\nNumerous others were identified with A records leveraging exactly the same domains:\n\n[https://urlscan.io/result/94a6995d-fa52-4007-acca-06a7effd168c/related/](https://urlscan.io/result/94a6995d-fa52-4007-acca-06a7effd168c/related/)\n\nInitially, multiple victims received phishing links from compromised emails registered at\nGMX:\n\n[Subject](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.5) Password Notification Wednesday, July 13, 2022 8:18:26 PM\n\n[Message Id](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.4) <20221307201826FA327A984E$921DB1434A@gmx.net>\n\n[Creation time](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.1) Wed, 13 Jul 2022 20:18:26 +0000 (Delivered after 6 seconds)\n\n[From](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.2) \"Service Request\" <tafuskazutcom4q@gmx.net>\n\n\n-----\n\n[To](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.6.3) <contact@victim.com>\n\nNotably, the actors are using hacked WEB-resources leveraging the access to them for\nplacing phishing without owners knowledge:\n\nAnd here we can see how the attacker was using the fleek service to host their malicious\ncode.\n\nLogoKit have already been identified on more than 300 domains which took place over the\npast week, and more than 700 sites over the past month.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome examples of various templates leveraged by LogoKit:\n\n- Bank of America\n\n- Virgin Fly\n\n- Office 365\n\n\n-----\n\n- GoDaddy\n\n- Firebase\n\n## References:\n\n[https://urlscan.io/result/acee5510-cde3-4003-a2cc-940764f43bbb/](https://urlscan.io/result/acee5510-cde3-4003-a2cc-940764f43bbb/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://urlscan.io/result/3134f384-6bee-47cf-baa6-4786fed728d3/](https://urlscan.io/result/3134f384-6bee-47cf-baa6-4786fed728d3/)\n\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-cybercrime-tool-can-build-phishing-pages-in-real-time/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-cybercrime-tool-can-build-phishing-pages-in-real-time/)\n\n[https://community.riskiq.com/article/a068810a](https://community.riskiq.com/article/a068810a)\n\n## IOCs:\n\nfleek[.]co\n\nstorageapi.fleek[.]co/0ad91b1c-9994-4a1d-bf88-18cf07dbaf52-bucket/continue.html?#\n(emailaddress)\n\ninstitutoaxioma.com.ar/ #(emailaddress) URL(http): /email25.godaddy.com-signrealm.getforge.io/ #(emailaddress)\n\nweb[.]app, csb[.]app\n\nus[.]archive[.]org\n\ngl1hz[.]csb[.]app\n\nia801507[.]us[.]archive[.]org\n\ncerstts[.]ga/100/wgbground\n\n## Newsletter\n\nKeep up to date with the latest cybersecurity news and developments.\n\nBy subscribing, I understand and agree that my personal data will be collected and\n[processed according to the Privacy and](https://resecurity.com/privacy-policy) [Cookies Policy](https://resecurity.com/cookies-policy)\n\n## Cloud Architecture\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
