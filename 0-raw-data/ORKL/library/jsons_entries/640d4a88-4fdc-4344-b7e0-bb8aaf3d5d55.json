    "plain_text": "# Threatening Redirect Web Service Instills Malicious Campaigns In Over 16,500 Websites\n\n**[digitalinformationworld.com/2022/04/threatening-redirect-web-service.html](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2022/04/threatening-redirect-web-service.html)**\n\nApril 10, 2022\n\nSecurity researchers are raising the alarm about a threatening traffic direction system named\nParrot.\n\nThe new redirect service is being outlined as the root cause of infecting more than 16,500\ndifferent servers playing host to various sectors like universities, blogs, adult sites, and even\nlocal governments.\n\nThis new TDS has been known to redirect vulnerable victims that match a particular target\nprofile towards different sources on the web like malicious sites or phishing programs.\n\nThe actors running these malicious campaigns begin the process by purchasing the TDS so\nthey can selectively control the target that’s coming in while forwarding it to another location\nthat has a similarly malicious theme.\n\nOn a routine basis, most TDS services are used by so those who belong to the marketing\nsector and that’s why there are credible reports showing how similar campaigns were run in\nthe recent past too\n\n\n-----\n\n[Parrot has been reported as being detected by security analysts that are working for Avast.](https://decoded.avast.io/janrubin/parrot-tds-takes-over-web-servers-and-threatens-millions/)\nThey have recently made claims about how the campaign was used for FakeUpdate which\nused fake browsers to deliver update notices about remote access trojans, better known as\nRATs.\n\nWhile the malicious incident may have been reported in February of this year, there are\nplenty of signs that show that it was very active since October of 2021.\n\nThe security analysts also shed light on how users can distinguish the alarming Parrot TDS\nfrom a number of others by how its far outreach and the number of target victims affected.\n\nIn addition, the analysts claim these malicious websites actually may not have too many\nsimilar findings other than the fact that servers hosted some unsecured CMS websites.\n\nThe new malicious web in place is based on poor servers that were laid down by hackers\nwho directed it to a number of locations through the parroting pattern.\n\nLast month alone, Avast was able to secure nearly 600,000 vulnerable targets through its\ndiverse services, disabling them from paying these infected areas a visit. And that just goes\nto show the huge potential of the Parrot gateway.\n\nCommon nations affected by Parrot included the likes of India, Singapore, Brazil, Indonesia,\nand the US too. But new emerging details showed how Parrot can finetune its filters to target\na particular user’s profile from hundreds of others.\n\nThey are known to achieve just that by forwarding the target to special URLs that have\ndetailed network profiles and intricately designed software.\n\nAnd while the RAT initiative may be the main target for the TDS, security experts believe\nsome of the affected servers actually serve as hosts for different phishing sites. And while\ntheir homepages may appear authentic like Microsoft’s classic log-in, they are not. Therefore,\nusers end up adding their credentials for accounts and become targeted.\n\nBut is there a solution to this problem? Well, Avast has been generous enough to outline a\nfew pointers worth a mention:\n\n1. Admins can scan their files using anti-virus software\n2. They should replace any JavaScript files with their originals\n3. Make use of the newest CMS version with extra plugins\n4. Keep an eye out for tasks that run automatically\n5. Make use of strong credentials for all accounts, including the use of 2FA where\n\nnecessary\n6. Add any security plugins for vulnerable sites like WordPress\n\nRead next: A new malware FFDroider is hacking social media accounts by stealing browser\ndata\n\n\n-----",
