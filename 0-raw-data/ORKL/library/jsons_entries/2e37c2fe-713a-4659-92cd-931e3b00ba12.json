Composite: NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock\nHungary’s far-right government suspected of hacking phones of investigative journalists and\ntargeting owners\n\nViktor Orbán’s government has deployed a new weapon in its war on the media in Hungary,\naccording to forensic analysis of several mobile devices, using some of the world’s most\ninvasive spyware against investigative journalists and the circle of one of the country’s last\nremaining independent media owners.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Pegasus project, a collaborative investigation run by the French nonprofit journalism\norganisation Forbidden Stories, has reviewed leaked records that suggest a wide range of\n[people in Hungary were selected as potential targets before a possible hacking attempt with](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hungary)\nthe sophisticated Pegasus spyware, sold by the Israeli company NSO Group. In a number of\ncases, forensic analysis confirmed devices had been infected with Pegasus.\n\nThe leaked data includes the phone numbers of people who appear to be targets of\nlegitimate national security or criminal investigations.\n\nQuick Guide\n\n**What is in the Pegasus project data?**\n\nShow\n**What is in the data leak?**\n\nThe data leak is a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to\nhave been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group,\nwhich sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers\nwere selected, or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit\njournalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared\naccess with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have\nworked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security\nLab, a technical partner on the project, did the forensic analyses.\n\n**What does the leak indicate?**\n\nThe consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients\nidentified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent, the\npresence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the\nphone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company’s signature surveillance tool, or whether\nany attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and\nUS numbers, which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools, reveals\nsome targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with\nPegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers\non the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the\nstart of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds.\n\n**What did forensic analysis reveal?**\n\nAmnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were\nsuccessfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30,\nthe tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced.\nFifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful\n\n\n-----\n\ninfection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of\ninformation required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of\ntargeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages.\n\nAmnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the\nUniversity of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed\nsigns of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic\nmethods, and found them to be sound.\n\n**Which NSO clients were selecting numbers?**\n\nWhile the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say\nwhich NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its\ntools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the\npattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to\nidentify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan,\nBahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the\nUnited Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO.\n\n**What does NSO Group say?**\n\nYou can read NSO Group’s [full statement here. The company has always said it does not](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/response-from-nso-and-governments)\nhave access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the\nconsortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s\ntechnology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list\nof numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to\nbelieve the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments\nusing Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been\nused by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. They said it was a list of numbers that\nanyone could search on an open source system. After further questions, the lawyers said the\nconsortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from\naccessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no\nbearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still\ndo not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group\ntechnologies”. Following publication, they explained that they considered a \"target\" to be a\nphone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus,\nand reiterated that the list of 50,000 phones was too large for it to represent \"targets\" of\nPegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative\nof whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus.\n\n**What is HLR lookup data?**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating\nmobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and\ntheir general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in\nrouting calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be\nused in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to\nconnect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an\ninterface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether\nPegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use\nits software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to\nPegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.\n\nHowever, the records also include the numbers of at least 10 lawyers, an opposition\npolitician and at least five journalists.\n\nThe phones of two journalists at the Hungarian Pegasus project partner, the investigative\noutlet Direkt36, were successfully infected with the spyware, including Szabolcs Panyi, a\nwell-known reporter with a wide range of sources in diplomatic and national security circles.\n\nForensic analysis of his device by Amnesty International stated conclusively it had been\nrepeatedly compromised by Pegasus during a seven-month period in 2019, with the infection\noften coming soon after comment requests made by Panyi to Hungarian government\nofficials.\n\nSzabolcs Panyi, left, and colleague András Szabó. Photograph: Andras Petho/Direkt36\n\n\n-----\n\nPegasus enables the attacker to view all content on a phone, including messages from apps\nwith end-to-end encryption, photographs and GPS location data. It can also turn the device\ninto an audio or video recorder. NSO has claimed the spyware is only meant for use against\nserious criminals and terrorists.\n\nPanyi thinks some in the Orbán government believe independent journalists are part of a\nconspiracy against them. “I think there’s widespread paranoia and they see much more in\nour motives and our networks than there actually is,” he said.\n\n“We are not aware of any alleged data collection claimed by the request,” said a Hungarian\ngovernment spokesperson in response to detailed questions about the targeting of Panyi and\nothers.\n\n[NSO Group said it “does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets”, cast doubt on](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/response-from-nso-and-governments)\nthe significance of the leaked data and said it would “continue to investigate all credible\nclaims of misuse and take appropriate action”.\n\n[Previously, Orbán’s spokesperson Zoltán Kovács has publicly attacked Panyi, accusing him](https://twitter.com/zoltanspox/status/1233003721010958336?s=11)\nof “Orbánophobia and Hungarophobia” and describing him as “deep into political activism”.\n\nSince Orbán became prime minister in 2010, Hungary has fallen from 23rd to 92nd in the\nWorld Press Freedom Index. Earlier this month, Reporters Without Borders put Orbán on its\nEnemies of Press Freedom list, the first time an EU leader has featured.\n\nSunrise in Budapest. There are few remaining Hungarian media outlets that are not under\nsome kind of government control. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n-----\n\nThere have been almost no cases of physical violence against journalists in Hungary;\ninstead, Orbán’s war of attrition against the media has used different means. These have\nincluded harassment of independent journalists, pressure on media owners, withdrawing\nstate advertising funds from critical titles and aggressive takeovers by government-friendly\nfigures.\n\n## Orbán’s covert war against the media\n\nWhen his forensics report came through, Panyi sat down in Direkt36’s Budapest newsroom,\na modest suite of offices inside a grand building one block from the Danube, and sketched\nout a chart in blue pen.\n\nOn the left-hand side: dates on which he sent official requests for comment to the Hungarian\ngovernment. On the right: dates on which forensic analysis shows his phone was\ncompromised by Pegasus.\n\nThe correlation was hard to ignore. On 3 April 2019, for example, Panyi sent a request for\ncomment to several government departments in relation to a story he was working on about\na Russian bank that was relocating to Budapest despite concerns it could be a front for\nRussian intelligence. One day later, Panyi’s phone was infected with Pegasus.\n\nThere were 11 occasions when a Pegasus infection was confirmed within a few days of a\ncomment request from Panyi to the government, according to Amnesty’s analysis.\n\nMore than half the comment requests he sent to various government offices during a sevenmonth period were followed up with an attack. The tactic, he assumes, was for the\ngovernment to get ahead of the story, work out what he was planning to publish and attempt\nto identify his sources.\n\nAnalysis carried out on the phone of one of Panyi’s colleagues at Direkt36, András Szabó,\nalso returned positive results. Direkt36 is one of just a few remaining Hungarian outlets not\nunder some kind of governmental control or influence.\n\n[explainer grey background version](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/07/mobile-explainer-zip/giv-825y7Y0FN3v6Ty5/)\nOther Hungarians selected for potential targeting include a photographer who worked as a\nfixer for a visiting foreign journalist, and a well-known investigative journalist, who declined to\nhave forensic analysis done or to be named, citing a fear of losing sources.\n\nAnother Hungarian journalist selected as a candidate for possible surveillance was Dávid\nDercsényi, who edits a newspaper put out by the authority of Budapest’s opposition-run\neighth district and previously worked for five years for the website of the independent outlet\nHVG.\n\nThree numbers linked to Dercsényi, including one belonging to his ex-wife that had been\nregistered in his name, were found in the data.\n\n\n-----\n\nHe expressed puzzlementhis name was in the data. Mostly I was working on average, notvery-sensitive topics,” he said. He suspects a request for comment sent to the government\nover a story about the trial of a former Islamic State operative could have drawn attention. He\nwas no longer in possession of any of the three phones appearing in the data, so analysis\nwas not possible.\n\nMore than 70 editorial staff at index.hu walked out of the newsroom after submitting\nresignations following Szabolcs Dull’s dismissal as editor in July 2020.

In an interview on the terrace of his grand villa in\nthe Buda Hills, he described receiving both enticements and threats from government-linked\nbusinesspeople to sell 24.hu and the rest of his sizeable media portfolio, which includes the\ncountry’s bestselling women’s magazine. On one occasion, he claims, he was told he would\nreceive generous state advertising subsidies if he made editorial staffing changes.\n\nPegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy – video\n“They think everything is about money.

Photograph: Central Media Group\n\n\n-----\n\nHe was right to be worried. A few weeks after Orbán won a third consecutive term as prime\n[minister in spring 2018, Varga invited six friends to dinner. Among them was Attila Chikán, a](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/thousands-rally-against-victor-orbans-election-victory-in-budapest)\nminister in Orbán’s first government in the late 1990s, who has since become a staunch critic\nof the prime minister. The others were wealthy and well-connected businessmen.\n\nOver wine and finger food on Varga’s expansive terrace, the men discussed creating a new\nfoundation that among other things would investigate and expose corruption among\nHungary’s ruling elite. “It was a friendly conversation, it wasn’t a coup,” said Varga.\n\nTwo weeks later he met a government-linked acquaintance for coffee and she\ndemonstratively referenced the dinner, suggesting such meetings could be “dangerous” for\nhim. Varga suspected Orbán’s circle had somehow put the meeting under surveillance.\n\nIndeed, the records show all seven people at the dinner were selected as potential\ncandidates for surveillance. Forensic analysis carried out on the handset of one of those\npresent showed clear evidence of a confirmed infection at the time of the dinner. The phone\nof another participant showed signs of Pegasus activity but not of compromise.\n\nQ&A\n\n**What is the Pegasus project?**\n\nShow\nThe Pegasus project is a collaborative journalistic investigation into the NSO Group and its\nclients. The company sells surveillance technology to governments worldwide. Its flagship\nproduct is Pegasus, spying software – or spyware – that targets iPhones and Android\ndevices. Once a phone is infected, a Pegasus operator can secretly extract chats, photos,\nemails and location data, or activate microphones and cameras without a user knowing.\n\nForbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty\nInternational had access to a leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers selected as targets\nby clients of NSO since 2016. Access to the data was then shared with the Guardian and 16\nother news organisations, including the Washington Post, Le Monde, Die Zeit and\nSüddeutsche Zeitung. More than 80 journalists have worked collaboratively over several\nmonths on the investigation, which was coordinated by Forbidden Stories.\n\nOne of those present expressed surprise the meeting had attracted such attention. “It was a\ntypical Hungarian discussion. We sat down, everybody said: ‘Fuck, the situation is really\nbad,’ but then it did not lead anywhere,” he said.\n\nAlong with Varga’s circle, the son and lawyer of the oligarch Lajos Simicska, Orbán’s\n[childhood friend turned enemy, also appear to have been candidates for surveillance around](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/12/orban-tightens-grip-on-hungary-as-oppositions-power-wanes)\nthe time that Simicska was pressured into selling his critical media holdings to governmentfriendly figures in 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nAjtony Csaba Nagy, Simicska s lawyer, recalled noticing strange sounds or replayed\nconversations during phone calls in 2018. “It also happened that some information appeared\nin the press that we only discussed on the phone, nowhere else,” he told Direkt36.\n\n[Map grey background version](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/07/journalist-map-zip/giv-8253ZtxIew3GjZH/)\n\n## Hungary, Israel and Pegasus\n\nA former NSO employee confirmed Hungary was among the company’s clients. It apparently\nacquired Pegasus in the aftermath of a 2017 visit to the country by the then Israeli prime\nminister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a close Orbán ally. NSO has denied it takes any direction\nfrom the Israeli government when choosing its customers.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu and Viktor Orbán shake hands at a joint press conference in Budapest\nin 2017. Photograph: AFP Contributor/AFP/Getty Images\nIn response to detailed allegations about Hungary’s acquisition and use of Pegasus, a\nHungariangovernment spokesperson said: “Hungary is a democratic state governed by the\nrule of law, and as such, when it comes to any individual it has always acted and continues\nto act in accordance with the law in force. In Hungary, state bodies authorised to use covert\ninstruments are regularly monitored by governmental and non-governmental institutions.”\n\n\n-----\n\n[Hungary has one of the loosest legislative frameworks in Europe for the authorisation of](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news)\nsurveillance. There is no judicial oversight if the request is made for national security\nreasons; only the signature of the minister of justice is required.\n\nInformation released to the Hungarian outlet 168 Óra under a freedom of information request\nshowed the justice minister, Judit Varga, approved 1,285 surveillance requests in 2020,\nwhich includes all forms of surveillance, not just Pegasus.\n\nIn an earlier interview with a Pegasus project partner, Varga said it was a “provocation” to\nask whether she would authorise surveillance of a journalist, but said “there are so many\ndangers to the state everywhere” when asked why she had approved so many requests. The\njustice ministry did not respond to detailed allegations about Hungary’s use of Pegasus.\n\nThe government communications office, when presented with the same allegations, replied\nwith questions of its own: “Have you asked the same questions of the governments of the\nUnited States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany or France? In the case you have,\nhow long did it take for them to reply and how did they respond? Was there any intelligence\nservice to help you formulate the questions?”\n\n[Orbán has built his political platform on staunchly opposing migration and claiming Hungary](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/hungary-viktor-orban-george-soros)\nis under attack from a network directed by the Hungarian-American financier and\nphilanthropist George Soros.\n\nThe leaked data reveals at least one case in which Pegasus appears to have been used in\nthe hope of uncovering – or inventing – a “Soros conspiracy”.\n\nOne of the numbers in the data belonged to Adrien Beauduin, a Belgian-Canadian PhD\nstudent.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdrien Beauduin. Photograph: Szabolcs Nagy/Index\nOn paper, he was the perfect “villain” for the Orbán government: a gender studies student at\nCentral European University (CEU), an institution founded by Soros. At the time, the\n[government was in the process both of ending the teaching of gender studies in Hungary](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/sep/06/state-control-over-academic-freedom-in-hungary-threatens-all-universities)\nand of [forcing CEU out of the country.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/dark-day-freedom-george-soros-affiliated-central-european-university-quits-hungary)\n\nBeauduin was arrested at a protest in Budapest in December 2018 and charged with\nassaulting police officers, which carries a sentence of up to eight years in prison. He denies\nhe was in any way violent towards police.\n\nBeauduin’s lawyer, Kata Nehéz-Posony, said there was “no real evidence” against him\nexcept for police testimony that was copied word for word from the case of another person\narrested.\n\nShe said she suspected the arrest was “highly politically motivated”. On 14 December, a few\ndays after the arrest, the then communications chief of Orbán’s Fidesz party publicly noted\nthat “the pro-immigration Soros network is organising violent demonstrations in Budapest”.\n\nAnalysis of Beauduin’s phone showed Pegasus activity on the device shortly after this,\nthough no sign of successful infection. Eventually, the most serious charges against him\nwere dropped, suggesting nothing incriminating was found.\n\n\n-----\n\nA former senior Hungarian counter-intelligence officer who left the service in the early part of\nthe last decade admitted there was a flexible approach to concocting national security\nreasons for surveillance during his time. “[But] there were two professions we kept our\ndistance from: lawyers and journalists,” he said.\n\nThe leaked records, and the analysis of infected devices, suggest that in Orbán’s Hungary\ntoday, this is no longer the case.\n\nTopics\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2Fjul%2F18%2Fviktor-orban-using-nso-spyware-in-assault-on-media-data-suggests&type=article&internalpagecode=news/2021/jul/18/viktor-orban-using-nso-spyware-in-assault-on-media-data-suggests)\n\n\n-----",
