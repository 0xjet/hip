One victim has already paid a $4 million ransom to\nBlackMatter this week to delete stolen data and receive both a Windows and Linux ESXi\ndecryptor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**BlackMatter ransom note**\n\n## BlackMatter's encryption routines match DarkSide\n\nWhile researching the new ransomware group, BleepingComputer found a decryptor from a\n[BlackMatter victim and shared it with Emisosft CTO and ransomware expert Fabian Wosar.](https://twitter.com/fwosar)\n\nAfter analyzing the decryptor, Wosar confirmed that the new BlackMatter group is using the\nsame unique encryption methods that DarkSide had used in their attacks.\n\nAfter looking into a leaked BlackMatter decryptor binary I am convinced that we are\ndealing with a Darkside rebrand here. Crypto routines are an exact copy pretty much\nfor both their RSA and Salsa20 implementation including their usage of a custom\nmatrix.\n\n— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar) [July 31, 2021](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1421504819890634754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWosar told BleepingComputer that the encryption routines used by BlackMatter are pretty\nmuch the same, including a custom Salsa20 matrix unique to DarkSide.\n\n[When encrypting data using the Salsa20 encryption algorithm, a developer provides an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#Structure)\ninitial matrix consisting of sixteen 32-bit words.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Salsa20 matrix**\n\n_Source: Wikipedia_\nWhen encrypting files, Fabian told BleepingComputer that instead of using constant strings,\na position, nonce, and key, for each encrypted file, DarkSide fills the words with random\ndata.\n\nThis matrix is then encrypted with a public RSA key and stored in the footer of the encrypted\nfile.\n\nFabian says this Salsa20 implementation was previously only used by DarkSide, and now\nBlackMatter.\n\nBleepingComputer was also told that DarkSide used an RSA-1024 implementation unique to\ntheir encryptor, which BlackMatter also uses.\n\nWhile there is not 100% proof that BlackMatter is a rebrand of the DarkSide operation, many\nsimilar characteristics make it hard to believe this is not the case.\n\nWhen we take the same encryption algorithms, the similar language used on the BlackMatter\nsites, similar craving of media attention, and similar color themes for their TOR sites, it is\nhighly like that BlackMatter is the new DarkSide.\n\nA rebrand from DarkSide also explains the reason the new BlackMatter group won't target\nthe \"Oil and Gas industry (pipelines, oil refineries),\" which led to their previous downfall.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a highly skilled group that targets multiple device architectures,\nincluding Windows, Linux, and ESXi servers.\n\nDue to this, we will need to keep an eye on this new group as they will surely perform attacks\non well-known targets in the future.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
