Reports\nfrom Trustwave and other security researchers show that Russian cyberattackers have\nmaintained pressure launching a series of attacks showing how malware has been used\nagainst organizations in Ukraine either to destroy or gain control over targeted systems.\n\nIn this article we will summarize some of the most prominent Russian threat actors involved\nand the malware tools used in cyberattacks against Ukraine.\n\n### Russian Threat Actors Behind the Attacks in Ukraine\n\nDespite the high level and technical sophistication of the cyberattacks, and the Russian\nSpecial Services’ ability to cover their tracks, several traces remain present after the attacks\nwhich leave no doubt of Russia’s involvement in the current attacks against Ukraine.\n\n[As mentioned in a report released by the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service and a UK](https://valisluureamet.ee/doc/raport/2018-en.pdf)\n[government publication we can clearly draw some connections between the most notorious](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russias-fsb-malign-cyber-activity-factsheet/russias-fsb-malign-activity-factsheet)\nthreat groups involved and Russian special services.\n\nAPT29, also known as Cozy Bear or The Dukes  to the Russian Foreign Intelligence\nService (SVR).\n\nAPT28, also known as Fancy Bear or Sofacy was traced to the Main Directorate of the\nGeneral Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (Former GRU) Unit 26165.\n\nSANDWORM, also known as Black Energy, was tied to the Main Directorate of the General\nStaff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (Former GRU) Unit 74455.\n\nDRAGONFLY, also known as Energetic Bear or Crouching Yeti was identified as the\nRussian Federal Security Service (FSB) Unit 71330.\n\nGAMAREDON, also known as Primitive Bear or Armageddon, traced to the Russian\nFederal Security Service (FSB) in November 2021. The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU)\nsuccessfully [identified individuals behind Gamaredon confirming their ties with FSB.](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vstanovyla-khakeriv-fsb-yaki-zdiisnyly-ponad-5-tys-kiberatak-na-derzhavni-orhany-ukrainy)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – Regular Hackers of the FSB_\n\n**https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vstanovyla-khakeriv-fsb-yaki-zdiisnyly-ponad-5-tys-**\n**kiberatak-na-derzhavni-orhany-ukrainy**\n\nOther actively involved threat actors such as UNC2589, also known as Ember Bear or\nLorec53, and InvisiMole do not present such clear ties with Russian special services.\n[However, as published by ESET researchers, InvisiMole was found to be using server](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ESET_InvisiMole.pdf)\ninfrastructure operated by Gamaredon.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – Threat Actors and Russian Special Services Connections_\n\n### Timeline of the Attacks & Malware Used\n\nThe flow timeline below illustrates the pressure placed on Ukrainian organizations and that\ngovernment infrastructure is the attacker’s primary target of the attackers. The variety of\nmalware used, and involvement of Russian state-sponsored threat actors makes it evident\nthat successful protection measures against attackers would require not only reactive but\nalso a proactive approach.\n\nLooking at the type of malware used, we can distinguish between 2 lines of attacks\ndifferentiated by the attacker's objectives:\n\nDestructive attacks are meant to destroy the data and render targeted systems\ninoperable.\nEspionage attacks are designed to establish a foothold and exfiltrate data from\ntargeted systems. Malware used in the attacks usually provides attackers backdoor\naccess with webcam and microphone captures, keylogging, and possibility to\ndownload and install additional components. Exfiltrated data includes operating\nsystem information, documents, pictures and stored passwords from web browsers\nand other software.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 – Malware Cyberattacks Targeting Ukraine_\n\n### Initial Vectors Used in the Attacks\n\nThe flow timeline below illustrates the initial attack vectors used to deploy malware.\nSpearphishing with malicious attachments or links are used to deliver CobaltStrike and\nGraphSteel backdoors or exploitation of vulnerabilities in public facing applications such as\nthe VPN appliances compromised in the Viasat cyberattack are some of the most common\nintrusion methods used. While the initial attack vector of HermeticWiper, HermeticRansom\nand CaddyWiper are not entirely known, at least one security vendor reported that the\nattackers appear to have exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server (CVE2021-1636).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 - Initial Attack Vectors_\n\n### HermeticWiper\n\nThis wiper malware was given the name “HermeticWiper” based on a stolen digital\ncertificate from a company called Hermetica Digital Ltd. HermeticWiper disables the Volume\nShadow Copy Service (VSS) responsible for data backup and abuses legitimate drivers\n[from the EaseUS Partition Master in order to corrupt data. As indicated by ESET and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\nconfirmed by the analysis of the Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Researchers, the wiper not\nonly corrupts master boot record (MBR) and volume boot records, but also wipes files by\ndefragmenting, rendering recovery impossible. It’s worth mentioning that HermeticWiper\nspecifically targets Windows registry files ntuser.dat and Windows event logs to minimize\nthe amount of usable forensic artifacts. Finally, the system restart is triggered rendering the\ntargeted host inoperable.\n\nIt's interesting to note that the compilation timestamp of the HermeticWiper malware was\nDecember 28, 2021. This suggests that the February attacks were in preparation since at\nleast that time.\n\nAPT responsible:\n\n_Sandworm (Black Energy,UAC-0082)_\n\nAttacks reported:\n\n\n-----\n\nFebruary 23, 2022: HermeticWiper used in massive cyberattacks against high-profile\n[Ukrainian organizations (Source: ESET)](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\n\nIOCs for HermeticWiper:\n\nSHA256:\n0385eeab00e946a302b24a91dea4187c1210597b8e17cd9e2230450f5ece21da\n\n### HermeticRansom\n\nHermeticRansom is written in Go language. As indicated by CrowdStrike’s [analysis, it](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-to-decrypt-the-partyticket-ransomware-targeting-ukraine/)\nenumerates available drives collecting a list of directories and files except for the Windows\nand Program Files folders. Selected file categories are renamed using the ransomware\noperator’s email address and .encryptedJB extension, then file contents are encrypted\nusing an AES algorithm. The ransomware also creates a read_me.html file in the Desktop\nfolder which contains a ransom note with the attackers’ contacts.\n\nThe encryption method is rather cumbersome and contains implementation errors making\nencrypted files recoverable. This flaw, together with political messaging found inside and\ndeployment timing consistent with HermeticWiper, suggests that HermeticRansom was\nlikely used as a distraction rather than a legitimate ransomware extortion attempt.\n\nAttacks reported:\n\nFebruary 23, 2022: HermeticRansom used in cyberattacks against Ukrainian\n[organizations (Source: ESET)](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\n\nIOCs for HermeticRansom:\n\nSHA256:\n4dc13bb83a16d4ff9865a51b3e4d24112327c526c1392e14d56f20d6f4eaf382\n\n### IsaacWiper\n\nAs indicated by ESET [analysis, IsaacWiper is entirely different from HermeticWiper from a](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\ncode perspective and is much less sophisticated. Upon execution it enumerates physical\ndrives and volumes overwriting the existing content with random bytes. If a volume access\nis denied, the wiper creates a temporary directory and file within this directory. The name of\nthe directory created will begin with the letters \"Tmd\" and file with the letters \"Tmf;” the\nremaining part of the name will be randomly generated alphanumerical characters. It will\nthen attempt to fill it with random data until the volume is out of space. The wiper also\nrenames files it can't access to temporary names and then attempts to wipe the newly\nrenamed file. IsaacWiper creates a log file C:\\ProgramData\\log.txt. where corrupting activity\nprogress is saved.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT responsible:\n\nGamaredon (Primitive Bear, Armageddon)\n\nAttacks reported:\n\nFebruary 24, 2022 - ESET: IsaacWiper used in cyberattacks against Ukrainian\ngovernment organizations. (Source: ESET)\n\nIOCs for IsaacWiper:\n\nSHA256: 13037b749aa4b1eda538fda26d6ac41c8f7b1d02d83f47b0d187dd645154e033\n\n### AcidRain\n\nAs indicated by Trustwave SpiderLabs’s analysis, AcidRain overwrites files and symbolic\nlinks with random data from the memory buffer in a recursive loop. If the wiper is executed\nwith root permissions certain directories such as: ‘bin,’ ‘dev,’ ‘lib,’ ‘proc,’ ’sbin ’ ’sys,’ and\n‘usr’ are avoided. The same random data buffer and write operation are used to wipe disk\ndevices ‘/dev/sdX,’ loop devices ‘/dev/loopX,’ memory block devices ‘/dev/block/mtdblockX’\nand multimedia card block devices ‘/dev/block/mmcblkX.’ Memory devices ‘/dev/mtdX’ are\nwiped using MEMWRITEOOB ioctl instead. After the wiping is done a device reboot is\ntriggered.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 – Reconstructed AcidRain’s Main Routine_\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the day the war started, a cyber-attack against Viasat’s KA-SAT\nnetwork impacted several thousand customers in Ukraine and tens of thousands across\nEurope. Spillover from this attack disabled the remote control of 5,800 Enercon wind\nturbines in Germany. As reported by Viasat, the attacker exploited Skylogic's VPN\nappliance gaining remote access to KA-SAT's network management segment. The attacker\nmoved laterally to a specific segment part used to operate the network and executed\nlegitimate, targeted management commands on a large number of residential modems,\nsimultaneously. Specifically, these destructive commands overwrote key data in the flash\nmemory on the SurfBeam modems.\n\nAcidRain wiper being discovered shortly after, is a plausible fit for this attack pattern.\nAnalysis of SurfBeam modems’ firmware published in a Reversemode blog revealed the\npossibility to install arbitrary binaries without requiring either a signature verification or a\ncomplete firmware upgrade. Moreover, the first Virustotal submission for AcidRain’s sample\naligns with the incident investigation timeframe and Skylogic Mediterraneo infrastructure\nlocation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – First AcidRain Sample Submitted to VirusTotal from Italy_\n\nIOCs for AcidRain:\n\nSHA256: 9b4dfaca873961174ba935fddaf696145afe7bbf5734509f95feb54f3584fd9a\n\n### LoadEdge (InvisiMole)\n\n[As indicated by CERT-UA analysis, LoadEdge backdoor used in this campaign supports](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37829)\nfunctionalities such as file execution, upload, download and deletion, obtaining system\ninformation, and interactive reverse shell over TCP port 1337.\n\nCommunication with the C&C server uses HTTP protocol and JSON formatted data, and\npersistence is provided by the HTA file creating an entry under the Run registry key.\n[Drawing conclusions from the ESET research paper, LoadEdge resembles an upgraded](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ESET_InvisiMole.pdf)\nversion of InvisiMole's TCP downloader component used to download further backdoor\nmodules called RC2FM and RC2CL, usually deployed as the first payload on a newly\ncompromised computer. InvisiMole's RC2FM and RC2CL backdoors provide extended\nsurveillance capabilities such as screen, webcam and microphone captures, documents\nexfiltration, collecting network information, and information about installed software.\n\nAPT responsible:\n\nInvisiMole (UAC-0035 )\n\nAttacks reported:\n\nMarch 18, 2022: LoadEdge used in email phishing attacks on Ukrainian government\n[organizations (Source: CERT-UA)](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37829)\n\nIOCs for LoadEdge :\n\nSHA256:\nfd72080eca622fa3d9573b43c86a770f7467f3354225118ab2634383bd7b42eb\n\n### GraphSteel & GrimPlant\n\nbackdoors are both written in the Go language. As indicated by a\n[BitDefender report, GrimPlant is a simple backdoor allowing for remote execution of](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/deep-dive-into-the-elephant-framework-a-new-cyber-threat-in-ukraine)\nPowerShell commands. Communication with the C2 server uses port 80 and is based on\n\n\n-----\n\ngRPC – an open-source RPC framework. The communications are encrypted with TLS, and\nits certificate is hardcoded in the binary. GrimPlant sends a heartbeat containing a basic\nhost information message every 10 seconds. Commands received from the C2 server are\nexecuted using PowerShell and the result is reported back.The GraphSteel backdoor is\ndesigned to exfiltrate data from infected machines. Communication with the C&C server\nuses port 443 and is encrypted using the AES cipher. GraphQL query language is used for\ncommunication. Files are exfiltrated from Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Desktop folders\nand all available drives from D:\\ to Z:\\. GraphSteel also exfiltrates basic system information,\nIP configuration, wifi profiles and steals credentials from the password vault using\npowershell.\n\nAPT responsible:\n\nUNC2589 Ember Bear, Lorec53, UAC-0056)\n\nAttacks reported:\n\nApril 26, 2022: GraphSteel & GrimPlant used in email phishing attacks on Ukrainian\n[government organizations (Source: CERT-UA)](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39882)\nMarch 28, 2022: GraphSteel & GrimPlant used in email phishing attacks on Ukrainian\n[government organizations (Source: CERT-UA)](https://cert.gov.ua/article/38374)\nMarch 11, 2022: GraphSteel & GrimPlant used in email phishing attacks on Ukrainian\n[government organizations (Source: CERT-UA)](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37704)\n\nIOCs for GraphSteel:\n\nSHA256: 47a734e624dac47b9043606c8833001dde8f341d71f77129da2eade4e02b3878\nSHA256: 8e77118d819681fdc49ce3362d8bfd8f51f8469353396be7113c5a8978a171f6\n\nIOCs for GrimPlant:\n\nSHA256: aca731d34c3e99d07af79847db369409e92e387520e44285608f18877b3a1d79\n\n### DoubleZero\n\nDoubleZero is a .NET wiper malware. Our analysis indicated that execution stops\nimmediately if the machine is a domain controller, otherwise it enumerates all the drives\nmounted to the machine and overwrites files with zero blocks, except for a specific\nhardcoded list of the system locations. Then the wiper moves on to the destruction of\nsystem files. In the end, the “lsass” process responsible for enforcing the security policy on\nthe system is terminated and all the subkeys in the HKLM, HKCU, and HKU registry hives\nare destroyed. Once all the destructive activity has been completed, the wiper will shut\ndown the system.\n\nAttacks reported:\n\n\n-----\n\nMarch 22, 2022: DoubleZero used in cyberattacks on Ukrainian enterprises (Source:\nCERT-UA)\n\nIOCs for DoubleZero :\n\nSHA256: d897f07ae6f42de8f35e2b05f5ef5733d7ec599d5e786d3225e66ca605a48f53\n\n### CaddyWiper\n\n[As indicated by a Cisco Talos advisory, CaddyWiper dynamically resolves most of the APIs](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/threat-advisory-caddywiper.html)\nused to make detection and analysis more challenging. CaddyWiper’s execution stops\nimmediately if the machine is a domain controller, otherwise the malware will attempt to\ndestroy files on \"C:\\Users\" followed by wiping all available drives from D:\\ to Z:\\. This means\nthat any network mapped drives attached to the system may be wiped also. It wipes a\nmaximum of a 10MB chunk from the beginning of the file, likely as part of performance\noptimization. Next the wiper attempts to zero out each physical drive corrupting master\nboot record (MBR) and extended information about a drive's partitions.\n\nAPT responsible:\n\nSandworm (Black Energy, UAC-0082)\n\nAttacks reported:\n\nApril 8, 2022: CaddyWiper used in a targeted cyberattack against a Ukrainian energy\n[provider (Source: CERT-UA)](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39518)\nMarch 14, 2022: CaddyWiper used in cyberattacks against Ukrainian organizations\n[(Source: ESET)](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1503436420886712321)\n\nIOCs for CaddyWiper:\n\nSHA256: a294620543334a721a2ae8eaaf9680a0786f4b9a216d75b55cfd28f39e9430ea\n\n### AwfulShred, SoloShred\n\nAwfulShred and SoloShred are malicious shell scripts designed to corrupt Linux systems.\nOur analysis revealed that the destructive activity of both scripts relies on a shred command\nwith one overwrite pass, chosen to increase the data damage. AwfulShred is also\nobfuscated, and its functionality is somewhat sophisticated. Prior to wiping the data, it\ndisables and corrupts Apache, HTTP and SSH services, deactivates the swap file, and\nclears bash history. Finally, a system reboot is triggered, rendering the targeted host\ninoperable.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – Deobfuscated Commands Revealing AwfulShred Functionalities_\n\nAPT responsible:\n\nSandworm (Black Energy, UAC-0082)\n\nAttacks reported:\n\nApril 8, 2022: AwfulShred and SoloShred used in a targeted cyberattack against a\n[Ukrainian energy provider (Source: CERT-UA)](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39518)\n\nIOCs for AwfulShred:\n\nSHA256:\nbcdf0bd8142a4828c61e775686c9892d89893ed0f5093bdc70bde3e48d04ab99\n\nIOCs for SoloShred:\n\nSHA256:\n87ca2b130a8ec91d0c9c0366b419a0fce3cb6a935523d900918e634564b88028\n\n### Industroyer2\n\nIndustroyer2 is a sophisticated piece of malware targeting industrial control systems (ICS).\nAs indicated by Nozomi Networks’ [analysis, it specifically abuses the IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC](https://www.nozominetworks.com/blog/industroyer2-nozomi-networks-labs-analyzes-the-iec-104-payload/)\n104) protocol used in electric power control systems. Unlike its predecessor, Industroyer,\nIndustroyer2 is a standalone executable consisting of a backdoor, loader, and several\npayload modules. Its only feature is to cause electric outages by disrupting operation of\ntransmission substations.\n\nOnce executed, Industroyer2 attempts to terminate legitimate processes responsible for\nIEC 104 service communication: PServiceControl.exe and PService_PPD.exe, then\nrenames the original executables by appending the “.MZ” file extension and begins IEC 104\ninteraction with transmission substations, interrupting the circuit breakers operation.\nSubstations IP addresses and ports were found hard-coded, meaning that the attackers had\nat least limited knowledge of their target.\n\nAPT responsible:\n\n\n-----\n\nSandworm (Black Energy, UAC-0082)\n\nAttacks reported:\n\nApril 8, 2022: Industroyer2 used in a targeted cyberattack against a Ukrainian energy\n[provider (Source: CERT-UA)](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39518)\n\nIOCs for Industroyer2:\n\nSHA256:d69665f56ddef7ad4e71971f06432e59f1510a7194386e5f0e8926aea7b88e00\n\n### CredoMap\n\nCredoMap is a .NET credential stealer used by the threat actor APT28.

Other interesting features include\npersistence using registry, stealing clipboard contents, command execution and DOS attack\nfunction. DCRat communicates with the C2 server via HTTP using GET and POST\nrequests.\n\n\n-----\n\nDark Crystal RAT (DCRat) appeared at the beginning of 2019. During its operation, the RAT\ngot a lot of followers and clients. The malware became widely known for a variety of plugins\nincluding Stealer, Hidden Remote Desktop, file manager, and anonymous operation (via\nTOR proxy). The software was distributed on a subscription basis: two months for 600 RUB\n(~9.5 USD), one year for 2500 RUB (~39 USD), and a lifelong subscription would cost you\n4500 RUB (~70 USD).\n\n_Figure 8 – DarkCrystal RAT_\n\nThe DCRat code has been available on GitHub since at least March 2021.

Although primarily designed for red\nteams, it is actively used by a wide range of threat actors from ransomware operators to\nAPT groups for downloading and executing malicious payloads. The Beacon implant is fileless, in the sense that it consists of stage-less or multi-stage shellcode that is loaded either\nby exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader. Communication with the C&C\nserver is supported over several protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB, named\npipes as well as forward and reverse TCP with a wide range of modifications. Connections\nalso can be established by chaining Beacons. Once an attacker gains access to a single\nsystem inside the compromised network, it can then be used to pivot internally into other\nsystems.\n\nAPT responsible:\n\nUNC2589 (Ember Bear, Lorec53, UAC-0056)\nOther\n\nAttacks reported:\n\nJuly, 7, 2022: Cobalt Strike Beacon used in email phishing attacks on Ukrainian\n[government organizations.

Cobalt Strike, originally\ncreated to train network defenders, is being actively abused by attackers in this conflict.\n\n### Protecting and Securing Your Network\n\nCritical infrastructure is vital for the functioning of modern societies and will always be a\nlucrative target for attackers seeking monetary gain, political or military advantage.\nUnderstanding what digital technologies and tools are used in a conflict can help identify\nand mitigate future threats before the damage happens.\n\nUnfortunately, people are usually the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain, as opening\nmalicious attachments or links often leads to a compromise. Effective prevention strategy\nshould include training programs, ensuring that personnel can identify and mitigate threats\ncoupled with use of secure email gateways such as Trustwave MailMarshal, anti-malware\nand endpoint protection solutions.\n\nInternet-facing systems should be always updated, protected by a firewall solution, regularly\nscanned for vulnerabilities, and audited for changes to the system integrity.\n\nTrustwave’s researchers are continuously gathering more information on the latest\ncyberattacks, helping our customers to stay safe during these turbulent times.\n\n\n-----",
