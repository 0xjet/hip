Following the leak, the US Department of Justice refused to admit some of the files\n[in a US case, saying they're classified material, and inadvertently confirming their validity,](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/whoops-the-doj-may-have-confirmed-some-of-the-wikileaks-cia-dump?utm_source=mbtwitter)\neven if the CIA never publicly acknowledging the leak.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Many clues support Symantec s findings\n\nNow, following an analysis of the WikiLeaks Vault 7 documents, US cyber-security firm\nSymantec is sure the documents describe the modus operandi and some of the tools of the\nLonghorn cyber-espionage group, which they first discovered in 2014, and tracked its activity\nback to 2007.\n\nThe tools used by Longhorn closely follow development timelines and technical\nspecifications laid out in documents disclosed by WikiLeaks. The Longhorn group shares\nsome of the same cryptographic protocols specified in the Vault 7 documents, in addition to\nfollowing leaked guidelines on tactics to avoid detection. Given the close similarities between\nthe tools and techniques, there can be little doubt that Longhorn's activities and the Vault 7\ndocuments are the work of the same group.\n\n[To sustain its conclusions, Symantec details its findings:](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/longhorn-tools-used-cyberespionage-group-linked-vault-7)\n\nA trojan detected by Symantec as Trojan.Corentry has all the features of the Fluxwire tool\ncontained in the Vault 7 dump. The Fluxwire changelog closely matches the timeline when\nSymantec detected new features in Corentry samples.\n\nUp until 2014, the CIA used GCC to compile Fluxwire samples, and then switched to MSVC,\na detail also observed with Corentry samples.\n\nEarly Corentry samples contained a reference to the file path for the Fluxwire program\ndatabase (PDB) file, linking Corentry with Fluxwire.\n\nThe CIA Fire and Forget tool, used for the user-mode injection of a payload called Archangel\nresembles the modus operandi of a trojan Symantec detected as Backdoor.Plexor.\n\nThe way the CIA used cryptography for its tools matches how the Longhorn group operated:\n\n- inner cryptography within SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks\n\n- key exchange once per connection\n\n- use of AES with a 32-bit key\n\nOther Vault 7 operational manuals describe attack techniques also used by the Longhorn\ngroup:\n\n- use of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) as a means of command and control (C&C)\ncommunications\n\n- usage of wipe-on-use as standard practice\n\n- in-memory string deobfuscation\n\n- use of a unique deployment-time key for string obfuscation\n\n- use of secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting\n\n- usage of a single domain and IP address combination per target for the C&C server\n\n## CIA accidentally hacked a computer in the US\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Symantec, Longhorn malware has been linked to attacks on 40 targets in 16\ncountries in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nAt one point, Longhorn infected a computer in the United States, but the group quickly\nremoved the malware within hours.\n\nWhile the Vault 7 dump helped Symantec link Longhorn with the CIA, the Shadow Brokers\n[dump from last year helped Kaspersky link the activities of a cyber-espionage group known](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/75812/the-equation-giveaway/)\nas the Equation Group, active since the mid-90s, to the CIA.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[White House: Prepare for cryptography-cracking quantum computers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/white-house-prepare-for-cryptography-cracking-quantum-computers/)\n\n['Hack DHS' bug hunters find 122 security flaws in DHS systems](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hack-dhs-bug-hunters-find-122-security-flaws-in-dhs-systems/)\n\n[US issues guidance on North Korean hackers, offers $5M reward](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-issues-guidance-on-north-korean-hackers-offers-5m-reward/)\n\n[FTC fines Twitter $150M for using 2FA info for targeted advertising](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/ftc-fines-twitter-150m-for-using-2fa-info-for-targeted-advertising/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a few\nmore.
