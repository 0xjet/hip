    "plain_text": "# Europe’s Largest Private Hospital Operator Fresenius Hit by Ransomware\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2020/05/europes-largest-private-hospital-operator-fresenius-hit-by-ransomware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/05/europes-largest-private-hospital-operator-fresenius-hit-by-ransomware)**\n\n**Fresenius, Europe’s largest private hospital operator and a major provider of dialysis**\nproducts and services that are in such high demand thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, has\nbeen hit in a ransomware cyber attack on its technology systems. The company said the\nincident has limited some of its operations, but that patient care continues.\n\nBased in Germany, the [Fresenius Group includes four independent businesses: Fresenius](https://www.fresenius.com/Group-Overview)\n**Medical Care, a leading provider of care to those suffering from kidney failure; Fresenius**\n**Helios, Europe’s largest private hospital operator (according to the company’s Web site);**\n**Fresenius Kabi, which supplies pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices; and Fresenius**\n**Vamed, which manages healthcare facilities.**\n\nOverall, Fresenius employs nearly 300,000 people across more than 100 countries, and is\nranked 258th on the Forbes Global 2000. The company provides products and services for\ndialysis, hospitals, and inpatient and outpatient care, with nearly 40 percent of the market\nshare for dialysis in the United States. This is worrisome because COVID-19 causes many\npatients to experience kidney failure, which has led to a shortage of dialysis machines and\nsupplies.\n\nOn Tuesday, a KrebsOnSecurity reader who asked to remain anonymous said a relative\nworking for Fresenius Kabi’s U.S. operations reported that computers in his company’s\nbuilding had been roped off, and that a cyber attack had affected every part of the company’s\noperations around the globe.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe reader said the apparent culprit was the Snake ransomware, a relatively new strain first\ndetailed earlier this year that is being used to shake down large businesses, holding their IT\nsystems and data hostage in exchange for payment in a digital currency such as bitcoin.\n\nFresenius spokesperson Matt Kuhn confirmed the company was struggling with a computer\nvirus outbreak.\n\n“I can confirm that Fresenius’ IT security detected a computer virus on company computers,”\nKuhn said in a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity. “As a precautionary measure\nin accordance with our security protocol drawn up for such cases, steps have been taken to\nprevent further spread. We have also informed the relevant investigating authorities and\nwhile some functions within the company are currently limited, patient care continues. Our IT\nexperts are continuing to work on solving the problem as quickly as possible and ensuring\nthat operations run as smoothly as possible.”\n\nThe assault on Fresenius comes amid increasingly targeted attacks against healthcare\nproviders on the front lines of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, the\ninternational police organization INTERPOL [warned it “has detected a significant increase in](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/Cybercriminals-targeting-critical-healthcare-institutions-with-ransomware)\nthe number of attempted ransomware attacks against key organizations and infrastructure\nengaged in the virus response. Cybercriminals are using ransomware to hold hospitals and\nmedical services digitally hostage, preventing them from accessing vital files and systems\nuntil a ransom is paid.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security‘s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\n**Security Agency (CISA) issued** [an alert along with the U.K.’s National Cyber Security](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/AA20126A)\n**Centre warning that so-called “advanced persistent threat” groups — state-sponsored**\nhacking teams — are actively targeting organizations involved in both national and\ninternational COVID-19 responses.\n\n“APT actors frequently target organizations in order to collect bulk personal information,\nintellectual property, and intelligence that aligns with national priorities,” the alert reads. “The\npandemic has likely raised additional interest for APT actors to gather information related to\nCOVID-19. For example, actors may seek to obtain intelligence on national and international\nhealthcare policy, or acquire sensitive data on COVID-19-related research.”\n\nOnce considered by many to be isolated extortion attacks, ransomware infestations have\nbecome de facto data breaches for many victim companies. That’s because some of the\nmore active ransomware gangs have taken to downloading reams of data from targets\nbefore launching the ransomware inside their systems. Some or all of this data is then\n[published on victim-shaming sites set up by the ransomware gangs as a way to pressure](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/ransomware-gangs-now-outing-victim-businesses-that-dont-pay-up/)\nvictim companies into paying up.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Security researchers say the Snake ransomware is somewhat unique in that it seeks to](https://labs.sentinelone.com/new-snake-ransomware-adds-itself-to-the-increasing-collection-of-golang-crimeware/)\nidentify IT processes tied to enterprise management tools and large-scale industrial control\nsystems (ICS), such as production and manufacturing networks.\n\nWhile some ransomware groups targeting businesses have publicly pledged not to single out\nhealthcare providers for the duration of the pandemic, attacks on medical care facilities have\ncontinued nonetheless. In late April, Parkview Medical Center in Pueblo, Colo. was hit in a\nransomware attack that [reportedly rendered inoperable the hospital’s system for storing](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ransomware-attack-on-colorado-hospital-highlights-fears-of-more-healthcare-hostage-situations/)\npatient information.\n\nFresenius declined to answer questions about specifics of the attack, saying it does not\nprovide detailed information or comments on IT security matters. It remains unclear whether\nthe company will pay a ransom demand to recover from the infection. But if it does so, it may\nnot be the first time: According to my reader source, Fresenius paid $1.5 million to resolve a\nprevious ransomware infection.\n\n“This new attack is on a far greater scale, though,” the reader said.\n\n**Update, May 7, 11:44 a.m. ET:** **[Lawrence Abrams over at Bleeping Computer says the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/large-scale-snake-ransomware-campaign-targets-healthcare-more/)**\nattack on Fresenius appears to be part of a larger campaign by the Snake ransomware\ncrooks that kicked into high gear over the past few days. The report notes that Snake also\nsiphons unencrypted files before encrypting computers on a network, and that victims are\ngiven roughly 48 hours to pay up or see their internal files posted online for all to access.\n\n\n-----",
