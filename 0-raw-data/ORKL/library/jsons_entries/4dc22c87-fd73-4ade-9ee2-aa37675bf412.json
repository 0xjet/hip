Our seventh annual\nretrospective is based on in-depth analysis of nearly 93,000 threats detected across our customers’\nover 4 million identities, endpoints, and cloud resources over the past year. This report provides you with\na comprehensive view of this threat landscape, including new twists on existing adversary techniques,\nand the trends that our team has observed as adversaries continue to organize, commoditize, and ratchet\nup their cybercrime operations.\n\nAs the technology that we rely on to conduct business continues to evolve, so do the threats that we face.\nHere are some of our key findings:\n\nMore data: Red Canary detected nearly 93,000 Trickier browser lures: The use of fake\nthreats in 2024, increasing last year’s total by CAPTCHA lures, a technique known as\nmore than a third.

The data that powers Red Canary and this report\nare not mere software signals—this data set is the result of hundreds of thousands of investigations\nacross millions of protected systems and identities.\n\nEach of the nearly 93,000 threats that we responded to have one thing in common: They weren’t\nprevented by our customers’ expansive security controls. This research is the result of a breadth and\ndepth of analytics and analysis that we use to detect the threats that would otherwise go undetected.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nRed Canary ingested 308 petabytes of security telemetry from our 1,400 customers’ endpoints,\nidentities, clouds, and SaaS applications in 2024. Our detection engine generated 30 million\ninvestigative leads that our platform pared down to nearly 93,000 confirmed threats, 25,000 of which\nwere high-severity threats that might’ve represented a significant risk to our customers if we hadn’t\ndetected them. Every one of these was scrutinized and enriched by professional detection engineers,\n[intelligence analysts, researchers, threat hunters, and an ever-expanding suite of bespoke generative](https://redcanary.com/blog/security-operations/genai-security-operations/)\n[artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools.](https://redcanary.com/blog/security-operations/genai-security-operations/)\n\n###### More than a quarter of the threats Red Canary  d t t d i 2024 hi h it\n\n\n###### More than a quarter of the threats Red Canary \n\n\n-----\n\nThe Threat Detection Report synthesizes the critical information we communicate to customers\nwhenever we detect a threat, the research and detection engineering that underlies those detections,\nthe intelligence we glean from analyzing them, and the expertise we deploy to help our customers\nrespond to and mitigate the threats we detect.\n\n###### What counts\n\nWe map our custom detection analytics and the other security signals we use to detect threats to\n[corresponding MITRE ATT&CK® techniques whenever possible. If the analytic or alert uncovers a](https://attack.mitre.org/)\nrealized or confirmed threat, we construct a timeline that includes detailed information about the\nactivity we observed, including extensive information about techniques an adversary leveraged.\nWe track this data over time to determine technique prevalence, correlation, and much more.\n\nDETECTIONS BY YEAR\n\nThis report also examines the threats that leverage these techniques and other tradecraft intending to\nharm organizations. While Red Canary broadly defines a threat as any suspicious or malicious activity\nthat represents a risk to you or your organization, we also track specific threats by programmatically\nor manually associating malicious and suspicious actions with clusters of activity, specific malware\nvariants, legitimate tools being abused, and known threat actors. We track and analyze these threats\ncontinually throughout the year, publishing Intelligence Insights, bulletins, and profiles, considering not\njust prevalence of a given threat, but also aspects such as velocity, impact, or the relative difficulty of\n[mitigating or defending against. The Threats section of this report highlights our analysis of common](https://redcanary.com/threat-…tion-report/threats/)\nor impactful threats, which we rank by the number of customers they affect.\n\nConsistent with past years, we exclude unwanted software and confirmed testing from the data we use\nto compile this report\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Limitations\n\nRed Canary optimizes heavily for detecting and responding rapidly to early-stage adversary activity.\nAs a result, the techniques that rank skew heavily between the initial access stage of an intrusion and\nany rapid execution, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and defense evasion. This will be in contrast\nto incident response providers, for example, whose visibility tends towards the middle and later stages\nof an intrusion, or a full-on breach. We often detect and action threats early, shielding organizations from\nthe wide array of risks associated with breaches and incidents. As such, one of the great benefits of this\nreport is that it acts as a playbook that organizations can follow to develop the ability to detect threats\nearly and often, before adversaries are able to accomplish their objectives and cause harm.\n\n\nKnowing the limitations of any methodology is important as you determine what threats your team\nshould focus on. While we hope our list of top threats and detection opportunities helps you and your\nteam prioritize, we recommend building your own threat model by comparing the top threats we share\nin our report with what other teams publish and what you observe in your own environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n## TRENDS\n\nRed Canary performed an analysis of emerging\nand significant trends that we’ve encountered\nin confirmed threats, intelligence reporting, and Ransomware\nelsewhere over the past year. We’ve compiled the\nmost prominent trends of 2024 in this report to\nshow major themes that may continue into 2025.\n\nInitial access tradecraft\n\nThe Technique and Threat sections of this report\nare focused on prevalent ATT&CK techniques and\nthreat associations from the more than 93,000\nconfirmed threats we detected in 2024. The\nTrends section takes us one step beyond that Identity attacks\ndata and allows us to narrate events that might\nnot be prevalent in our detection dataset but may\nbe emergent or otherwise deserve your attention.\n\nVulnerabilities\n\n###### What’s included in this section\n\nWe’ve written an extensive analysis of nine\ntrends we tracked throughout 2024. This PDF Stealers\nincludes an abridged version of our analysis,\ndescribing the trend and explaining why it matters.\nYou can view the full analysis—including mitigation,\ndetection, and testing guidance—in the\n\nInsider threats\n\n[web version of this report.](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/)\n\n###### How to use our analysis\n\nVPN abuse\n\nThe Trends section provides valuable insight and\nactionable recommendations for security leaders\nto make informed decisions. We offer advice to\nhelp defenders prepare, prevent, detect, and\nmitigate activity associated with these trends Cloud attacks\nwhere relevant. The guidance we provide differs,\nsince each trend requires a different approach.\nYou might also use our analysis to help anticipate\nand plan for key trends that may continue into\n\nMac malware\n\n2025, just as we saw with 2023 trends extending\ninto 2024.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware is holding strong as a lucrative\nbusiness model for criminals. Despite early wins\nfrom law enforcement actions, this past year saw\nincreasingly sophisticated and agile operations,\nwith adversaries asking for higher payouts.\n\nAs with last year, Red Canary’s visibility into the\nransomware landscape focused on the early\nstages of the ransomware intrusion chain—the\ninitial access, reconnaissance, lateral movement,\nand command and control (C2) occurring before\nexfiltration or encryption, which we refer to as\n“ransomware precursors.” Focusing on detecting\nthese precursors continued to be a solid approach\nto stopping ransomware in 2024, so we’ll focus on\nsharing what has worked for us.\n\nWe saw few intrusions making it to the final stages,\nand this meant that no ransomware group made\nit into our top 10 threats for any month or the year\noverall. This past year we observed activity related\nto the following ransomware variants:\n\n###### • Akira\n • Play\n • FOG\n • LockBit\n • RansomHub\n • Black Basta\n\nSince our visibility centers on ransomware\nprecursors, we also recommend checking out\nransomware reporting from other researchers\nfor a full perspective across the intrusion chain.\n\n\n###### Common ransomware precursors in 2024\n\nAs in previous years, multiple threats in our\ntop 10 play a role in ransomware intrusions\nas common precursors:\n\n\n###### TRENDS\n### Ransomware\n\n###### Ransomware continues to surge year-over-year,  and payout demands are only getting higher.\n\nRansomware is holding strong as a lucrative Common ransomware\nbusiness model for criminals. Despite early wins\n\n\n-----\n\nWe’ve previously shared the simplified\nransomware intrusion chain below as a way to\nthink about detection across the entire intrusion,\nand it continues to hold up as a high-level\napproach to breaking down ransomware.\n\n###### Initial access\n\n Lateral movement\n\n Recon\n\n Exfiltration\n\n Encryption\n\n Ransomware  intrusion chain\n\nHere are some of the common techniques,\ntools, and procedures we observe across\n“pre-ransomware” intrusion stages.\n\n###### Initial access\n\nRansomware affiliates continue to rely on the same\nbroad categories of exploitation of vulnerabilities\n\n\n[initial access. This year we observed affiliates](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/initial-access/)\n[exploiting vulnerabilities in ScreenConnect and](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/vulnerabilities/)\nFortinet software.\n\nWe also observed a plethora of phishing varieties,\nmost notably with Black Basta affiliates who\n[conducted extensive social engineering](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-intelligence/storm-1811-black-basta/)\n[campaigns that began with email bombing](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-intelligence/storm-1811-black-basta/)\nto flood a victim’s inbox with spam. Next, the\nadversary—posing as an IT admin offering to help\nwith the email problem—contacted the user via\nphone or a link to join a Microsoft Teams call. Once\nin contact, the adversary guided the user into\n[running a remote monitoring and management](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/rmm-tools/)\n[(RMM) tool like Microsoft Quick Assist, AnyDesk,](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/rmm-tools/)\nor TeamViewer.\n\nWatch our video on the Black Basta email\nbombing campaign.\n\nIn August 2024, we observed ransomware\n[incidents that leveraged virtual private networks](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/vpn-abuse/)\n[(VPN), particularly Cisco ASA, as an initial](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/vpn-abuse/)\naccess vector and to facilitate further access\nwithin organizations. To exploit VPN appliances,\nadversaries typically conduct password spray\nattacks targeting login accounts with weak\npasswords and without MFA. Reporting indicates\n[that both Akira and FOG ransomware affiliates](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/akira-ransomware-targeting-vpns-without-multi-factor-authentication)\nhave targeted VPN software for initial access.\n\n[Finally, as noted in the Stealers section of](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/info-stealers/)\nthis report, we continued to see increasing use\nof info-stealing malware for obtaining valid\ncredentials, which adversaries use or sell to\nransomware affiliates to gain access.\n\n###### Lateral movement\n\nAdversaries are fast and furious when it comes\nto lateral movement, with some intrusions\nprogressing in a matter of hours. A continuing\ntrend is adversaries quickly moving to unmonitored\nparts of the network; this past year, adversaries\noften favored moving to VMware ESXi hypervisors,\nwhich are rarely well-monitored. In these attacks,\nadversaries deploy encryptors developed for\nLinux to stop all virtual machines running on a\nvictim’s hypervisor before encrypting individual\n\n\n-----\n\nHypervisors are a particularly valuable target\nbecause organizations often use them to host\nbusiness-critical services, and they are unable\nto host endpoint sensors. Although most\nransomware reporting focuses on Windows\nvarieties, many of the more prolific ransomware\nfamilies—like RansomHub, Play, Black Basta,\nand Akira—include a Linux variant that they\ncan deploy against hypervisors.\n\nPrior to moving to ESXi environments, adversaries\ncommonly obtain credentials through tools like\nMimikatz and move laterally using detectable\n[tools like PsExec or Impacket. We also observed](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-detection/threat-hunting-psexec-lateral-movement/)\nadversaries downloading and using RMM tools\nto facilitate lateral movement as well as persist\nin the environment and act as their command\nand control.\n\n###### Reconnaissance\n\nAs adversaries land on new systems, we regularly\nobserve them conducting reconnaissance with the\nusual built-in commands:\n\n###### • ipconfig\n • whoami\n • net\n • nltest\n\nWe have also observed adversaries using free\nopen source tools like AdFind, Angry IP Scanner,\n[BloodHound, Nmap, PCHunter, SoftPerfect](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/bloodhound/)\nNetScan, and others to map out victim\nenvironments and scan the system for hosts.\n\n###### Command and control\n\nThis past year, we saw adversaries continue to\nabuse RMM tools. (Adversaries use these tools\nto facilitate lateral movement, persistence, and\ncommand and control; we classify RMM usage\n[under command and control consistent with](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/)\n[MITRE ATT&CK.) RMM tools are an attractive](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/)\noption for adversaries because they offer robust\nsets of remote administration features with the\nveneer of legitimacy, as they are used for regular\nbusiness functions.\n\n\nThis past year, we most commonly saw the\nfollowing RMM tools:\n\n###### • NetSupport Manager\n • AnyDesk Standalone\n • TightVNC\n • ConnectWise\n • TeamViewer Standalone\n • AdvancedRun\n • RUSTDESK\n • Ammyy Admin\n\n Notable ransomware trends in 2024\n\nIt’s hard to believe that only a couple years ago,\nit would have been relatively unheard of for a\nransomware actor to call their victim on the phone.\nHowever, what used to be SCATTERED SPIDER’s\nsignature technique has proliferated across\nransomware actors. Aggressive social engineering\ntactics that include calling the victim have spread\nacross the ransomware ecosystem. At Red\nCanary, we observed an increase in email\nbombing followed by voice phishing, consistent\n[with Black Basta precursor behavior.](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-intelligence/storm-1811-black-basta/)\n\nAnother technique that has spread across the\n[ransomware ecosystem is the use of RMM tools](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/rmm-tools/)\nfor command and control and lateral movement.\nFor example, this year we saw NetSupport\nManager break into our top 10, demonstrating\nthe popularity of the use of RMM tools.\n\n###### New ransomware groups\n\nThe past year saw an emergence of new\nransomware variants, with newer groups quickly\n[rising to the tops of charts for number of victims](https://www.ransomware.live/stats)\n[compromised (based on data from their own data](https://www.ransomware.live/stats)\nleak sites). Prolific groups like FOG, RansomHub,\nand FunkSec all first appeared on the scene in\n2024. Groups that began operations in 2024\nrepresented a large percentage of ransomware\n[attacks, with some researchers estimating](https://www.blackfog.com/new-ransomware-gangs-in-2024/)\nthat new groups made up over 50 percent of the\ncompromises in November and December 2024.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Record-high costs of a  ransomware event\n\nRansomware continues to be a lucrative business\nfor criminals, with victims in 2024 reportedly\nmaking record-high ransom payments, with one\n[as high as $75 million. Despite these individually](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/07/31/record-breaking-75-million-ransom-paid-to-dark-angels-gang/)\n[large ransom payments, there was a drop in](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-crime-ransomware-victim-extortion-2025/)\n[the total amount of ransom earnings in 2024,](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-crime-ransomware-victim-extortion-2025/)\n[combined with a decreasing percentage of](https://www.coveware.com/blog/2024/11/1/law-enforcement-doxxing-raises-risk-profile-for-threat-actors)\nvictims that pay the ransom. Whether victims\nchoose to pay or not, the costs of being\nransomed far exceed the requested\nransom amount.\n\nBusinesses often face regulatory fines, litigation,\nand reputational damage from ransomware\nevents, which can impact future earnings. Since\n[the SEC’s requirement to disclose material](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gerding-cybersecurity-disclosure-20231214)\n[cyber events in late 2023, there has been a boon](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2024/08/21/data-breach-securities-class-actions-record-settlements-and-investor-claims-on-the-rise/#1)\n[to class action lawsuits following data leaks.](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2024/08/21/data-breach-securities-class-actions-record-settlements-and-investor-claims-on-the-rise/#1)\nThe increased media reporting of ransomware\nincidents, made possible through adversary leak\nsites, has also likely contributed to this boon.\nAttorneys monitoring for any data breaches\nreported to the SEC or on data leak sites will\ninitiate these so-called “event-driven litigations”\nalmost immediately upon disclosure. In some\ncases, multiple attorney groups will initiate\nlawsuits, driving up the cost to the victim.\n\n\n###### A silver lining: Law enforcement takedowns\n\n2024 started off with a big win against\n[ransomware operator LockBit with Operation](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/the-nca-announces-the-disruption-of-lockbit-with-operation-cronos)\n[Cronos, a multi-national effort led by the UK](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/the-nca-announces-the-disruption-of-lockbit-with-operation-cronos)\nNational Crime Agency (NCA). The trans-national\ndisruption operation involved law enforcement\nagencies from nine countries, who collectively\ntook down 34 servers, seized more than 200\ncryptocurrency wallets, seized the LockBit data\nleak site, and arrested two alleged LockBit\nmembers. The LockBit disruption was quite\ndifferent than previous takedown efforts in that it\naimed not only at dismantling the infrastructure\n[but also sowing distrust in the ransomware](https://analyst1.com/ransomware-diaries-volume-5-unmasking-lockbit-2/)\n[marketplace, releasing affiliate names and](https://analyst1.com/ransomware-diaries-volume-5-unmasking-lockbit-2/)\nstating that developer LockBitSupp was\nworking with authorities.\n\nDespite this effort, LockBitSupp announced\nwithin five days that operations had resumed.\nAlthough LockBit continued to post victims\nthroughout 2024, some researchers assessed that\n[the majority of the posted victims listed were](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/d/operation-cronos-aftermath.html)\n[from older intrusions, calling into question the](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/d/operation-cronos-aftermath.html)\naccuracy of LockBit’s claims.\n\n\n###### Life-saving detection  and response:  Learn how Red Canary  stopped a ransomware  attack at a major hospital.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Take action\n\n[Visit the Ransomware trend page for detection](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/ransomware/) Prevention\nopportunities and relevant atomic tests to validate\nyour coverage.     - Educate employees on the latest\n\nransomware actor TTPs, such as the email\n\nThe good news for defenders is that even though flooding techniques employed by Black\nnew techniques and tools have emerged, many Basta affiliates.\nransomware techniques have remained the same    - To prevent unauthorized access to Microsoft\nfor the past several years.

Adversaries will often change\nthe filename, download and run it from a\nnon-standard directory, or make suspicious\nnetwork connections.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2024, adversaries used a wide range of\nmethods to access and mislead unsuspecting\nvictims. Users had to contend with malicious links\nand phishes presented in a multitude of ways,\nincluding via email, search engines, Microsoft\nTeams messages, and phone calls. “Paste and\nrun,” a technique used to fool users into running\nmalicious code, grew in popularity in the second\nhalf of the year. Adversaries used this method to\nobtain legitimate credentials and leveraged them\nto great effect, particularly for virtual private\nnetwork (VPN) access.\n\n###### Paste and run away\n\nOne of the most successful new initial access\ntechniques we observed this year was paste and\nrun, also known as “ClickFix” and “fakeCAPTCHA.”\nThe last half of the year made clear that this\nwas an effective method of luring victims into\n[executing malicious PowerShell code. Red Canary](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/powershell/)\nfirst observed the technique in August 2024,\n[although other researchers reported seeing it in](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/clipboard-compromise-powershell-self-pwn)\n[use as early as March 2024. Proofpoint coined](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/clipboard-compromise-powershell-self-pwn)\nthe commonly used moniker ClickFix to initially\ndescribe the ClearFake cluster and TA571’s use of\n[this technique. They subsequently expanded the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-actor-uses-compromised-accounts-customized-social-engineering)\nterm as they observed it being used by additional\nactors. At Red Canary we chose to refer to the\ntechnique in general as “paste and run,” since not\nall of the lures involve a “fix” of some kind.\n\n\n[Different styles of lures have been reported,](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf)\nincluding a phishing lure, where the victim has to\ncopy-paste-run the code to “fix” their access to\n[something, like a document or a video meeting:](https://blog.sekoia.io/clickfix-tactic-the-phantom-meet/)\n\n[Image courtesy of Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/clipboard-compromise-powershell-self-pwn)\n\nAdversaries have also employed this technique via\ncompromised websites with browser injects, posing\neither as fake CAPTCHAs to access the site or as\na page loading error requiring a “fix” to display\nthe page:\n\n\n###### TRENDS\n### Initial access tradecraft\n\n###### Sketchy CAPTCHAs, fake updates, social engineering, and more; adversaries continued their masquerading, tricking users throughout 2024.\n\nIn 2024, adversaries used a wide range of [Different styles of lures have been reported,](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf)\nmethods to access and mislead unsuspecting including a phishing lure, where the victim has to\n\n\n[reported,](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n[To give an example using a fake CAPTCHA—](https://x.com/g0njxa/status/1825940825400029483)\nthe lure we’ve most frequently observed—users\nare presented with the typical “Verify you\nare human” prompt with an “I’m not a robot”\nbutton. Clicking the button covertly copies an\nobfuscated PowerShell command to the clipboard\nand presents the user with “verification steps,”\ninstructing them to:\n\n###### • Press Windows button + R (the keyboard\nshortcut for the Windows Run dialog)\n\n###### • Press CTRL + V (to paste the previously copied\nPowerShell command, which the user likely\ndoes not realize was copied)\n\n###### • Press Enter (execute the command)\n\nAn encoded PowerShell command then leverages\n[Microsoft HTML Application Host (mshta.exe)](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/mshta/)\nto download and execute a malicious payload\nfrom a remote resource.

The malicious sites may present\nwhatever lure the adversary wants to use,\nincluding a fake software installer, a document\ndownload, or one of the fake browser updates\nmentioned above.\n\n###### Malvertising\n\nSEO poisoning is not the only way adversaries\nuse search engines to their advantage. Malicious\nadvertising, also called “malvertising,” is\nthe use of fake ads on search engine pages.\nThese ads masquerade as legitimate websites\nfor downloading software like Quickbooks,\nGrammarly, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and\nmore.

If anything, it’s\nmade them more valuable as adversaries can\nnow target a centralized identity—often without\never accessing an endpoint workstation at all—\nto gain access to numerous disparate SaaS\napplications, accounts, or systems. In this way, a\ncompromised identity is often the starting point for\nintrusions that can lead to the kinds of incidents\nmost organizations are actually concerned about,\nincluding:\n\n###### • intellectual property theft\n • theft of computing resources\n • espionage\n • ransomware\n\nOf course, organizations wouldn’t adopt identity\nproviders and IAM solutions if they only created\nrisk by centralizing access behind a single\nauthentication mechanism. In fact, the risk created\nby centralized identities is offset by the security\ncontrols that are baked into—and can be built on\ntop of—identity providers. Most identity solutions\nmake it easy to enforce multi-factor authentication\n(MFA).

Therefore,\norganizations should pay special attention to\nthe identity threat landscape and be careful to\nmanage their identity infrastructure as safely\nand securely as possible.\n\n###### Identity attacks in 2024\n\nThree of the top 10 ATT&CK techniques we\ndetected this year were cloud-native techniques\nenabled by identity.\n\n###### • Cloud Accounts\n • Email Forwarding Rule\n\n\n###### TRENDS\n### Identity attacks\n\n###### Thanks to new partnerships and technology, Red Canary detected  four times as many identity threats in 2024 than the year before.\n\nA working username and password (or an access remains valid.

It’s\ndifficult to say with certainty that identity attacks\nare increasing, remaining steady, or decreasing.\nHowever, the moment we started looking for\nidentity threats, we found them in droves, and\nas more customers have adopted our identity\nproducts, the number of identity threats we’ve\ndetected has ballooned dramatically.\n\n\nLikewise, identity threats are growing relative to\nnon-identity threats (e.g., endpoint and cloud\nthreats) across Red Canary as well, as shown on\nthe next page. Non-identity threats continue to\nmake up the bulk of what we detect, but that’s\nbecause managed detection and response for\nendpoints is our oldest and mostly widely adopted\nproduct. As customer adoption levels out between\nthe different detection domains (e.g., endpoint,\nidentity, cloud, email, etc.), we’d expect to see the\nratio of identity vs. non-identity threat detections\nto normalize—although it will be interesting to see\nwhat is normal for that ratio.\n\nWhat’s clear is this: Identities are a major focal\npoint for adversaries. However, identity attacks\nremain a means to an end. It’s impossible to\nenumerate all the things an adversary might do\n\n\n-----\n\n[from ransomware attacks to espionage to](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/ransomware/)\ncryptocurrency mining and includes just about\neverything in between.\n\nSince an adversary might choose to do anything\nonce they have access to an identity, it’s critical\nto understand how they gain access to an identity,\nwhich we will explain in the following paragraphs.\n\n###### How adversaries compromise identities\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of techniques\nand other factors that adversaries leverage to\ncompromise identities.\n\n###### Phishing\n\n[All varieties of phishing remain a powerful tool that](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/initial-access/)\nd i f tl l t t i k i t\n\n\nhanding over credentials that they can then use to\ncompromise an identity.\n\n###### Malware\n\nMalware is another powerful tool for gathering\nvalid credentials and session tokens. The\ninformation stealer ecosystem in particular is\nhighly commoditized with widely available and\nturnkey as-a-service solutions that seem to be\nfueling widespread account compromise and\ntakeover activity.\n\n###### Session hijacking\n\nAdversaries also frequently do an end-around on\nthe need to steal credentials at all by intercepting\n[session tokens (often stored in cookies) to gain](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-detection/aws-sts/)\naccess to accounts or identities without the need\nto authenticate.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Vulnerability exploitation\n\n[Software vulnerabilities arise from time to time](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/vulnerabilities/)\nthat enable adversaries to exploit their way into\nan account, elevate their privileges from an\nalready compromised account, or otherwise\nexecute code.\n\n###### Credential stuffing\n\nAdversaries take advantage of rampant\npassword reuse through a process known\nas credential stuffing, whereby they leverage\nvariously sourced username-password\ncombinations associated with a user and try\nto log into other accounts using those same\nusername-password combos.\n\n###### Password spraying\n\n[Password spraying is a technique similar to](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-detection/brute-force-attacks/)\ncredential stuffing where adversaries bombard\naccounts brute-force-style with common or easily\nguessed passwords to compromise the account.\n\n###### Data leaks\n\nData leaks warrant mention here as they provide\nfodder for the credential stuffing and password\nspraying attacks mentioned above.\n\n###### Adversary and  man-in-the-middle attacks\n\nAdversary-in-the-middle (AitM) and man-in-themiddle (MitM) attacks enable password theft by\npresenting users with a legitimate-looking (but\nfake) account access portal. If the user enters their\ncredentials into the fake login field, the adversary\ncan then use those credentials to log into the\nactual account in real time. An added benefit of\nthese techniques is that the adversary can present\nusers with an MFA field after the login, enabling\nthem to potentially bypass MFA protections as\nwell. If a user inputs their MFA challenge code, the\nadversary can relay it in real time to the actual\nf\n\n\n###### MFA circumvention\n\nSince many organizations enforce MFA\nfor sensitive accounts, circumventing or\nbypassing MFA protections is often a prerequisite\nfor adversaries attempting to compromise an\nidentity. And there’s a long list of techniques that\nadversaries leverage to overcome the protection\nprovided by MFA, including the following:\n\n###### • AitM/MitM attacks\n • MFA exhaustion\n • SIM swaps\n • Help desk social engineering\n\nAn adversary can also bypass MFA and take\nownership of an account if they are able to\nbypass any of the configured password reset\nmethods configured in Self-Service Password\nManagement (SSPM). While we’ve researched this\nin Entra ID and some terminology may be Azure/\nMicrosoft specific, this technique probably applies\ngenerally to other identity providers as well.\n\nIn essence, an adversary would initiate a\npassword reset on behalf of the user, which\nwould send a password reset code to the actual\nuser, via their mobile device, for example. The\nadversary would then convince the real user to\nsupply the generated code—either by phishing or\nanother method—before resetting the password\nand gaining access to the account in question.\n\n\n###### Learn how AI agents help us distinguish whether certain user behaviors are malicious or simply just unusual.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Take action\n\n[Visit the Identity attacks trend page for](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/identity-attacks/) Passwordless solutions\ndetection opportunities and relevant atomic tests\n\nPasswordless solutions are another great tool\n\nto validate your coverage.\n\nfor closing off wide varieties of identity attack\nvectors.

Mandiant\nreported that these individuals had also leveraged\ntheir access to organizations to conduct other\nkinds of malicious intrusions, beyond merely\ncollecting paychecks to provide revenue for their\nhome country.\n\nIt’s important for organizations to understand\nthis threat both specifically and in the abstract.\nWhile the report and subsequent headlines about\nNorth Korean workers infiltrating organizations\nare relatively new, the idea that geopolitical\nadversaries may try to compromise companies\nin this way is probably not new. It’s highly likely\nthat this kind of activity has been in the playbooks\nof countries with sophisticated electronic warfare\nand espionage capabilities for years, even\ndecades. The key distinction here is that North\nKorea’s objectives are primarily profit-driven,\nwhereas similar activities undertaken by other\ncountries are likely focused on espionage,\nintellectual property theft, and related\nstrategic goals.\n\n\n###### Assessing the risk for your business\n\nOrganizations and their leaders ought to be\naware of the risk posed by this variety of insider\nthreat, even though it may manifest in very\ndifferent ways. For example, if you manufacture\nmicrocontrollers and are deeply involved in the\nhyper-competitive, global semiconductor trade\nthat impacts everything from weapons systems\nto transportation to literally every variety of\ncomputing device, then you may have serious\nreasons to suspect that your country’s geopolitical\nfoes have a vested interest in implanting malicious\ninsiders within your company to steal data or spy.\nTo complicate matters further, the supply chain\nfor semiconductors—and the employees you might\nexpect to work within it—are global as well. So it’s\nreasonable to have workers capable of obtaining\nhighly sought after intellectual property travelling\nto and from—or even living in—adversarial nations.\n\nOn the other hand, if your company makes shoes,\nthen you may be a more likely target for insiders\nwho are profit-motivated like those described in\nMandiant’s report. In either case, this reporting\nand the revelations surrounding it highlight the\n\n\n-----\n\nimportance of vetting and monitoring employee\nactivities in relation to their roles, access, and\noverall expected behavior, and should serve as\na reminder to organizations of the risks posed by\ninsider threats.\n\n###### Insider threats from DPRK workers in 2024\n\nMandiant has been tracking this activity as\nUNC5267 across numerous incident response\nengagements since 2022, though they believe\nthe campaign may date back as far as 2018. We\n[won’t retread all of the details in Mandiant’s](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat)\n[report, since you can (and should) read it directly](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat)\nfrom the source. That said, the report included\nextensive technical information that’s proven\nuseful in helping other organizations identify\npotential North Korean nationals working within\ntheir own organizations.\n\nIn fact, Red Canary conducted a wide-ranging\nthreat hunt across our customer base using\ninformation from the report (e.g., network\nindicators, such as IP addresses, Autonomous\n[System Numbers, and known-abused VPNs)](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/vpn-abuse/)\nshortly after its release—and we immediately\ndiscovered unusual sign-ins from abnormal VPNs\nconsistent with details described in the Mandiant\nreport. We’re highly confident that countless other\norganizations and security vendors made similar\ndiscoveries in the weeks and months following\nthe release of Mandiant’s report, and we believe\nthis may be a widespread, ongoing problem\nacross organizations.\n\n###### What we found in  customer environments\n\nIdentifying potential impostor employees is a\ndifficult task that requires analyzing multiple\ndata points across multiple telemetry sources.\nOne common indication of suspicious activity\nis a user connecting from unusual IP ranges,\nincluding some consumer VPN products. Although\nnot inherently malicious, this anomalous activity\nis enough to warrant further investigation, but\ndoing so means you have to be able to collect and\n[investigate identity data from an identity provider](https://redcanary.com/solutions/identity-threat-detection-and-response/)\nor from SaaS platforms like Google Workspace or\n\n\nThe report also indicated that workers often\nleveraged remote access tools (RAT) to remotely\naccess company-issued devices. These devices\nseem to have been routed to various laptop\nfarms around the world rather than directly to\nthe imposter employees (presumably to cloak\ntheir true locations). They also leveraged software\nlike Caffeine to keep computers from going into\nsleep mode and maintain the illusion that the\nfake employees were online, at their computers,\nand working.\n\nMonitoring for unsanctioned remote access tools\nin your environment may help detect this and other\nmalicious activity.

Over the\nlast few years, most companies have moved their\ninfrastructure and business operations to the\ncloud: either partially or entirely. In 2024 we have\n[seen those numbers continue to grow. Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-11-29-gartner-says-cloud-will-become-a-business-necessity-by-2028)\nforecasts that IT spending on public cloud services\nwill exceed $1 trillion in 2027, adding that “by 2028,\ncloud computing will shift from being a technology\ndisruptor to becoming a necessary component for\nmaintaining business competitiveness….”\n\nThe cloud is here to stay, cementing itself as a core\nfunction of business operations for the foreseeable\nfuture. This trend has only been accelerated by the\n[recent interest in artificial intelligence (AI), as](https://redcanary.com/blog/security-operations/genai-security-operations/)\nmany businesses are leaning on cloud providers to\npower their AI business services and operations.\n\nAdversaries are well aware of this movement.\nIn recent years, they have shifted much of their\nefforts to attacking and compromising cloud\ninfrastructure, a trend we have observed directly.\nIn this section we will cover the current threat\nlandscape for the cloud and how you can ensure\nyou are employing effective strategies to protect\nyour business.\n\n\n###### TRENDS\n### Cloud attacks\n\n###### While we saw a general rise in cloud attacks in 2024, the  techniques adversaries employ have largely stayed the same.\n\nCloud technology continues to expand. Over the Surveying the skies\nlast few years, most companies have moved their\n\n\nBefore we can fully get into what the cloud threat\nlandscape looks like, we need to understand a few\nkey points. First, cloud technologies depend heavily\non identity. For more information on how identities\n[are compromised, see the Identity attacks](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/identity-attacks/)\n[section of this report. As identity technology is](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/identity-attacks/)\nheavily intertwined with cloud technologies, most\ncloud attacks begin with a compromised identity.\n\nSecond, many cloud attack techniques are enabled\nby a misconfiguration by a well-meaning developer,\nsecurity engineer, or IT administrator. It can be very\ndifficult to distinguish between “normal” behavior\nof a legitimate user and an adversary trying to\nperform some operation in an environment. Thus,\nit is important to monitor for anomalous behavior\nand configuration changes in your environment as\nit could indicate the presence of a malicious actor.\n\nThird and last of all, each major cloud provider\nmay have slight variations in what techniques\nshow up most frequently. We’ll highlight and\ngeneralize the most common patterns of behavior\nthat apply across cloud providers to help paint\na broad picture of what the current cloud threat\nlandscape looks like.\n\n###### What we saw in 2024\n\nThroughout the year Red Canary continued\nto ramp up our cloud detection capabilities.\n[We support cloud detection for Amazon Web](https://redcanary.com/integrations/aws-cybersecurity/)\n[Services](https://redcanary.com/integrations/aws-cybersecurity/) [(AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud](https://redcanary.com/integrations/aws-cybersecurity/)\n[Platform (GCP). We also have detection](https://redcanary.com/integrations/gcp-cybersecurity/)\n[capabilities for related areas such as identity](https://redcanary.com/solutions/identity-threat-detection-and-response/)\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter looking over threats we published and\nresearch from others, we have seen only minor\nchanges in how adversaries are attacking\ncloud environments.\n\nTo start, let’s consider how adversaries gain\naccess to cloud environments. Three of the most\ncommon ways they do this are:\n\n###### • misconfigurations\n • credential theft\n • application errors\n\nThis seems to indicate that when configured\nand managed correctly, the authentication\nmechanisms provided by cloud service providers\n(CSP) provide good security. Along with\nidentifying misconfigurations or bugs, adversaries\nhave also gone after the human element by\nattempting to get credentials from a user or\nfinding exposed credentials elsewhere. Once\nan adversary has access to an environment,\nthere are myriad techniques they can employ to\nperform reconnaissance, gather sensitive data,\ncompromise more privileged accounts, and more.\n\nWe’ll identify the most prolific threats we have\nseen once an adversary has some level of access\nto a cloud environment and highlight some\nemerging trends.\n\n###### Cloud attack techniques\n\nIn general we saw a rise in cloud-related threat\nactor activity in 2024. The techniques employed,\nhowever, did not change substantially. Let’s focus\non a few high-level MITRE ATT&CK techniques\nseen across all the major cloud providers.\n\n###### Impair Defenses (T1562)\n\nAcross our customer base we saw a clear trend\n[of adversaries attempting to impair defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/)\ninside of a cloud environment. The two most\ncommon approaches we observed were disabling\nor modifying firewall rules and disabling or\nmodifying logging in the cloud environment.\n\n\nDisabling or modifying firewall rules\n\nAdversaries attempt to access cloud environments\nto take advantage of the services that are running\ninside them. This can allow them to set up a Secure\nShell (SSH) into a compute instance or Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) into a virtual machine.\nThey may also gain access to internal applications\nhosted in the cloud environment. Having direct\nnetwork access to certain services allows the\nadversary to maintain access to the environment\neven if they lose access to the compromised\naccount they used for initial access.\n\nDisabling or modifying logging\n\nOur ability to detect adversary behavior in a cloud\nenvironment depends heavily on our ability to\nreview audit logs generated by the cloud provider.\nKnowing this, adversaries attempt to disrupt the\nability to view or receive these logs. This would\nallow them to operate in the cloud environment\nvirtually undetected.\n\n###### Account Manipulation (T1098)\n\nAdversaries are constantly looking for ways to\n[gain more privileges, often by compromising an](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/)\nidentity and then attempting to grant more roles\nto the identity. This then allows them to potentially\nexpand their operations to other services or even\ncompletely take over a cloud environment.\n\nIf an organization has granted its users overly\npermissive roles, adversaries can escalate\nprivileges with just one set of compromised\ncredentials. Each major cloud provider has\ndifferent defaults for assigning privileges to\nidentities. The identities may be human users or\nthey could be service accounts that are tied to\n[a specific service, such as Kubernetes, virtual](https://redcanary.com/solutions/kubernetes-and-linux-security/)\nmachines, serverless functions, etc.\n\n###### Credential Theft (TA0006)\n\nWhile a stolen username and password can\ngrant an adversary access to a victim’s cloud\n[environment, credentials such as API keys,](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/)\n[certificates, and various tokens enable the](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-detection/aws-sts/)\n[adversary to maintain that access over a longer](https://redcanary.com/blog/incident-response/aws-ransomware/)\n[period of time](https://redcanary.com/blog/incident-response/aws-ransomware/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCommon ways adversaries steal\ncredentials include:\n\n###### • finding publicly exposed credentials\n • using adversary-in-the-middle technologies\nsuch as Evilginx\n\n###### • phishing users for their login credentials\n • leveraging stealer malware\n\nRegardless of how the adversaries gain access\nto the credentials, the end goal is the same: They\nwant to gain access to a cloud environment as a\nlegitimate user. They can then leverage that access\nto understand the user’s permissions and what\ntradecraft they can execute as that user.\n\n\n###### AI enters the cloud\n\nMany of the major cloud service providers (CSPs)\n[offer artificial intelligence](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/ai-cybersecurity/) [(AI) services as part of](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/ai-cybersecurity/)\ntheir suite of products, and adversaries have taken\nnotice.

Red Canary’s overall detection\nvolume for macOS threats is relatively low,\nprimarily because macOS devices represent a\nrelatively small fraction of the endpoint devices we\nprotect. Even so, we saw a 400 percent increase\nin macOS threats from 2023 to 2024, driven in\nlarge part by stealer threats like Atomic, Poseidon,\nBanshee, and Cuckoo stealers. Importantly, these\nthreats were most active early in the year up until\naround the end of summer and then tapered off\nsignificantly toward the last few months of the\n\n\n###### TRENDS\n### Mac malware\n\n###### macOS stealers ran rampant throughout most of 2024, until  Apple remediated Gatekeeper bypassing with the release of macOS Sequoia.\n\nIn most years, macOS threats vary from their\n\n###### macOS threats in 2024\n\nWindows counterparts for a variety of reasons,\n\n\nAlthough stealers have targeted macOS prior to\n2024, this year showed a large proliferation of\nmultiple stealer families targeting the platform.\nDuring the year, we observed Atomic, Poseidon,\nand Banshee stealers targeting macOS systems,\nwith each family sharing some properties and\ndiverging in small ways.\n\n[In terms of initial access, each of these families](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/initial-access/)\nfollowed a well-tread pattern for most of the year.\nA victim encountered the malware by downloading\nit under the guise of free or cracked software or\nthrough a malicious advertisement. The user\nwould download a disk image (DMG) file for\nmacOS containing the malware inside. Once\nmounted, the user would encounter a dialog\ninstructing them to right click on the downloaded\nsoftware and click “Open.”\n\n[Image courtesy of Moonlock Labs](https://moonlock.com/atomic-macos-stealer)\n\n\n###### Red Canary observed four times as many macOS threats in 2024 than in 2023.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis dialog box surreptitiously instructed the\n[user to bypass macOS Gatekeeper controls—a](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-detection/gatekeeper-bypass-vulnerabilities/)\nsafety measure in macOS platforms to restrict\nthe system into only executing signed code. We\n[covered this technique extensively in the 2023](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/gatekeeper-bypass/)\n[Threat Detection Report. At the time Gatekeeper](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/gatekeeper-bypass/)\ncould be bypassed for unsigned software by rightclicking on the unsigned software and instructing\nit to open. In September 2024, Apple removed\nthe ability to bypass Gatekeeper in this manner\nin macOS Sequoia, likely explaining the drop in\ndetections we saw toward the end of the year.\n\nOnce executed, the stealer would prompt the\nuser for their password, mostly using AppleScript\nprocesses. Although the specific message often\nchanged between stealer versions, it always either\nexplicitly asked for password entry or implied the\nneed to supply a password for a system change.\n\n\nThe adversary’s goal here is two-fold: to obtain\nthe password itself and to use sudo commands\nin case they need to access additional sensitive\ndata that requires elevated access. Once the\nvictim enters their password, a multitude of filegathering activities occur. These actions may vary\nslightly between different stealer versions, but they\ncommonly target:\n\n###### • macOS keychain files\n • browser credentials in Google Chrome, Mozilla\nFirefox, Vivaldi, Brave, and others\n\n###### • cookies in Safari\n • Apple Notes databases txt, pdf, docx,\n```\n  wallet, key, keys, and doc files in user’s\n  Desktop and Documents folders\n • cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions\n • Telegram desktop data\n\n```\nDuring the stealer execution, message boxes\nfor macOS Transparency, Consent, and Control\n(TCC) would pop up asking to access sensitive\ndata. From the number of stealers we observed\nin the year, we can assert that the TCC messages\ndid precious little to stop the data theft as users\nclicked past them.\n\nImages from sandbox executions\n\nOnce the data was gathered into a staging folder\non disk, the stealers would compress it into a ZIP\narchive using a ditto command. Then, the ZIP\narchive would be exfiltrated to an adversarycontrolled system over HTTP. Depending on the\nstealer family, this exfiltration may use curl\ncommands to upload or it may be implemented in\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Apple takes action\n\n[In macOS Sequoia, Apple removed the Gatekeeper](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-detection/gatekeeper-bypass-vulnerabilities/)\n[bypass commonly used by multiple stealer families](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-detection/gatekeeper-bypass-vulnerabilities/)\nfor execution. This had a marked impact in the\nnumber of stealer executions we observed, with\n95 percent of stealer infections happening prior to\nSeptember and just 5 percent occurring after.\n\nStarting in September, the number of macOS\nstealer detections tapered off with only\noccasional encounters.\n\nThis feature change also caused adversaries to\nexperiment with different ways to distribute their\n[malware, as seen in this tweet by DefSecSentinel:](https://x.com/DefSecSentinel/status/1844494230376644678)\n\n\n###### 95 percent of the year’s stealer detections arrived before September 2024.\n\n\nIn the malware sample shown, the adversary\ndecided to distribute their initial payload as a shell\nscript within a DMG file, coaching the user through\ndragging it on top of a Terminal icon to launch it.\nWith this approach, Gatekeeper doesn’t stand in\nthe way of malware execution.\n\nWith Gatekeeper bypasses off the menu in new\nmacOS builds, adversaries now have to try\nharder to distribute their malware.

The use of fake update lures to entice\na user to run a malicious JS dropper to download\nand install NetSupport has remained consistent.\nHowever, at the procedure level, Scarlet Goldfinch\ndemonstrated several changes throughout 2024,\nindicating ongoing active development.\n\n\nSCARLET GOLDFINCH TIMELINE\n\nDecember 2023\nScarlet Goldfinch introduces\nrandom numbers to vary install\nfolders and the filenames\nused for the ZIP file containing\nNetSupport.\n\nFebruary 2024\nThe ZIP and JS lure names\nchange from including the date\nand a random number to a lure\n\n|December 2023 Scarlet Goldfinch introduces random numbers to vary install March 2024 folders and the filenames The name of the run key used for the ZIP file containing used for persistence changes NetSupport. to a\u0003 new value.|August 2024 Scarlet Goldfinch drops the u\u0003se of a ZIP file as the initial download, replacing it with a\u0003 direct download of a file n\u0003amed Update.js .

For about 15 months prior\n[to that, Scarlet Goldfinch had used PowerShell](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/powershell/)\ncode as the second-stage downloader to deploy\nNetSupport onto the system. Spawned by the\n```\nwscript process, PowerShell would reach out to \n\n```\na C2 domain to pull down a ZIP file containing\nthe NetSupport client32.exe binary, unzip the\ncontents to a folder in %AppData%, execute it,\nand modify the CurrentVersion\\Run key in\nthe Windows registry to establish logon\npersistence. This PowerShell code saw minor\nchanges over time, similar to the filename lures,\nadding increased obfuscation through variables\nand modifying the installation folder and run\nkey names. But the basic functionality\nremained unchanged.\n\n\nThen, in November 2024, the PowerShell\ncomponent disappeared from the infection chain.\nInstead, the adversaries beefed up the code in the\nJS file. The tactics and higher-level techniques\nremained the same–pull down a ZIP containing\nNetSupport, write it to a folder, and establish run\nkey persistence–but the procedures for doing this\nnow existed entirely within the initial JavaScript\ndropper. While this change not only represents\nactive code development, it also impacts\ndetection strategies.\n\nBut as often happens, when one door closes\nanother one opens. Scarlet Goldfinch no longer\ntriggers the subset of PowerShell detection logic\nit once did, but we’re now seeing new activity\nfrom some of our other detection logic.\n\n\n### Take action\n\n[Visit the Scarlet Goldfinch threat page for](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/scarlet-goldfinch/)\ndetection opportunities and relevant atomic\ntests to validate your coverage.\n\nOne of the best ways to mitigate risks associated\nwith Scarlet Goldfinch–as well as SocGholish,\n[Gootloader, and other threats that begin with](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/gootloader/)\nmalicious JavaScript files–is to change the\ndefault behavior in Windows to open JS files\nwith notepad or another editor rather than\nimmediately executing them.

Typically adversaries\ndeliver HijackLoader as a ZIP archive containing\na legitimate executable alongside a malicious\nDLL sideloaded as a DLL hijack (the “hijack” in\n“HijackLoader”), among other files. The malicious\npayload is steganographically hidden in a separate\nimage file and identified by the string of letters\nIDAT within the binary contents of the image.\n\n[HijackLoader’s execution flow begins with](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/08/31/fake-update-utilizes-new-idat-loader-to-execute-stealc-and-lumma-infostealers/)\nthe hijacked legitimate EXE, passing through\nthe sideloaded DLL, which reads in the image\nfile containing the encrypted HijackLoader\nconfiguration details.
