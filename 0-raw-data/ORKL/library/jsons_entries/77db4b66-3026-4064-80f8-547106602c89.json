    "plain_text": "# BlackNet RAT - When you leave the Panel unprotected\n\n**[pwncode.io/2019/12/blacknet-rat-when-you-leave-panel.html](http://www.pwncode.io/2019/12/blacknet-rat-when-you-leave-panel.html)**\n\nBlackNET is a PHP based Web Panel which has a builder written in VB.NET. It is being\nactively used in-the-wild for malicious activities.\n\nRecently, while analysing a malicious .NET Binary, I came across something interesting\nwhich caught my attention. Before I share those details, I will discuss a little bit about the\ncapabilities of the payload, the project itself and then will present the discovery :)\n\n**MD5 hash of the sample discussed: 7e88ccc91e0f9a242c4723e43afa93ab**\n\nThe .NET binaries used in-the-wild which leverage BlackNET panel are not obfuscated. At\nleast the binaries I analysed so far are not protected or obfuscated. This makes the process\nof analysis straightforward.\n\n**How to identify whether this is related to BlackNET?**\n\nWhen you decompile the binary, the list of .NET methods are sufficient to correlate and\n[understand that they have used the BlackNET project. In our case, after decompiling the](https://github.com/BlackHacker511/BlackNET/)\n.NET binary, we can see the list of methods as shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe names of the methods are self explanatory however for the purpose of brevity, I will\nmention below some of the capabilities:\n\n**AntiVM: It has the ability to detect a Virtual Machine by checking for the presence of the DLL**\nfiles, vmGuestLib.dll and vboxmrxnp.dll on the file system. If it finds these files, then it will\ndelete them.\n\nIt also tries to load the DLL, SbieDll.dll to check for the presence of Sandboxie (a very\ncommon method).\n\n**DDoS: Various methods of DDoS are supported by this binary which include: ARME,**\nSlowloris, UDP, TCP, HTTP GET and HTTP POST request based. The attacker can specify\nthe host address they want to perform the DDoS attack against using the BlackNET Panel.\n[They can also select the DDoS method as can be seen here](https://github.com/BlackHacker511/BlackNET/blob/bf8aa55934f423795ce70630403e36f1857f1362/BlackNET%20Panel/menus/ddos_attack.html)\n\n**LimeLogger: This is the key logging module which leverages LowLevelKeyboardProc()**\nfunction along with SetWindowsHookEx() to do keylogging.\n\n**Screening_Programs: This method checks for the presence of analysis tools used by**\nMalware Researchers. It performs checks using both the process names as well as the\nWindow Titles as shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nI have included the list in Appendix which can be used as a reference by you to harden your\nVirtual Machine while analyzing malwares in future.\n\n**Unprotected Web Panels**\n\nThese web panels are easy to deploy. Just get a web hosting, upload the PHP scripts, run\nthe Installation script which sets up the database and the Panel is ready to use.\n\nI noticed that most users of BlackNET Web Panel are leveraging the hosting provided by\n000webhostapp.com\n\nOne such example is the binary we are discussing in this article.\n\nOnce the sample is executed on the machine, it will gather basic details from the machine,\nsend them in an HTTP GET request to the BlackNET panel and register the machine. For\neach victim's machine, an ID is generated in the format: Hacked_<ID>\n\nBelow is an example of the HTTP GET requests initiated by the binary:\n\n\n-----\n\nWeb Panel is located at: kiraamora.000webhostapp.com/blacknet\n\nIf we visit the hosting, we notice that there is no index.php script present. As a result of it,\ndirectory listing is enabled as shown below:\n\nThere is an upload directory in which the information captured from the machines is stored.\nInside the upload directory, there is a directory for each victim's machine with the name in the\nformat: Hacked_<ID>\n\nThere is one directory of specific interest as shown below:\n\nThe JPG file there is the screenshot taken from the machine. If we check the screenshot, we\nnotice that it is the screenshot taken from the BlackNET panel's admin machine itself as\nshown below:\n\nIf we check the URL in the address bar in screenshot above, we can see that the command:\n\n\n-----\n\ntkschot was used to capture the screenshot from the machine.\n\n[The command itself is defined in the code here](https://github.com/BlackHacker511/BlackNET/blob/682c89b59fb5c718359ba2a9a08819773dd755ef/BlackNET%20Panel/sendcommand.php#L247)\n\nThis could be the result of the admin verifying whether the panel is working properly by\ntaking a screenshot of their machine. However, they forgot to delete the screenshot from the\npanel to clear any traces.\n\nBelow are some more MD5 hashes of .NET binaries using the BlackNET Panel:\n\nd25ee82934bec167345502a1e7e3c931\n3d28dc46e048daee4974dc5e2fe08bfd\n1fd19fcca59ed976ee57640dafba5518\n601b4e3b04069beed78e8ce1d2859d4a\nc736fcdba9c96eb9b7d8f65e6ab8a4c9\n52cd657b18efdbd92f7347d439016c6b\n6e36e783324800952f4c0ebea2262fb9\ne829cf7a744547e5f1aca6f53061a7b7\n2033caac6e8064bd845004d4d628ebe3\n8ea79fb698558a8fbed892a8297f3f4b\n8d72b32f0d9796443218f1363324f731\n281a4bbd61d5e5e310c407b10dafb78c\ncd1084d9755db2a38402df2171f25948\n83614ce163a71a04fb450f5cd55bfb9f\n4a9102b122d9a8dcfe693693f4d91910\n8c7e485a40ba5f1881801e56ca298eb0\n6fa52977cb3aef5606900cd7a11df4da\n6947014e2a2b60445860bfaf5ba35dc6\nbdfa464369c660fabff9ec700c49bab9\n9b4402ac464744fd4ed118c956752bbc\ndc4cf73a81f74f4aa3ec5224ba2cee91\n31dc0a5c441b531e029a4158354a1529\n6d34058315b46deb297c3d7f712f7451\n53c1d9cbf7ca1147880de072d64980dd\nd45bac3b009058b11cabc7a9b4048c8d\n\n**More Web Panels:**\n\nhxxp://davidescu.000webhostapp.com/BlackNET Panel/\nhxxps://imdavidfree.000webhostapp.com//BlackNET%20Panel\nhxxps://impieselfree.000webhostapp.com/blacknet\nhxxp://homedeco.id/\nhxxps://davidbotnet.000webhostapp.com/blacknet\nhxxp://piratashost.top:82/panel/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix:**\n\n**List of Process Names Checked:**\n\nprocexp\nSbieCtrl\nSpyTheSpy\nSpeedGear\nwireshark\nmbam\napateDNS\nIPBlocker\ncports\nProcessHacker\nKeyScrambler\nTiGeR-Firewall\nTcpview\nxn5x\nsmsniff\nexeinfoPE\nregshot\nRogueKiller\nNetSnifferCs\ntaskmgr\nReflector\ncapsa\nNetworkMiner\nAdvancedProcessController\nProcessLassoLauncher\nProcessLasso\nSystemExplorer\n\n**List of Window Titles Checked:**\n\nApateDNS\nMalwarebytes Anti-Malware\nTCPEye\nSmartSniff\nActive Ports\nProcessEye\nMKN TaskExplorer\nCurrPorts\nSystem Explorer\nDiamondCS Port Explorer\n\n\n-----\n\nVirusTotal\nMetascan Online\nSpeed Gear\nThe Wireshark Network Analyzer\nSandboxie Control\n.NET Reflector\n\nc0d3inj3cT\n\n\n-----",
