For example, hours before INA reported being infected,\na Sophos malware analyst reported a new malware command-and-control server going live and being involved in CLOP-related operations.\n\nFurthermore, this week, security researchers have also spotted new versions of the CLOP ransomware on VirusTotal, an aggregated malware\n[scanning service [1,](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1230201628399149058) [2,](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1230215255483129857) [3].](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1230196138097160192)\n\nThe use of the CLOP ransomware in the attack against INA also fits the bill when it comes to CLOP's regular modus operandi.\n\nAccording to BleepingComputer, a tech news site specialized in ransomware news and research, the operators of the CLOP ransomware\n[switched tactics in March 2019 from targeting end-users to targeting companies.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cryptomix-clop-ransomware-says-its-targeting-networks-not-computers/)\n\nThe CLOP gang is now what security researchers call \"big-game ransomware,\" which is a term referring to criminal groups that specifically\ntarget companies to infect their networks, encrypt data, and ask for extremely large ransom demands.\n\n\n-----",
