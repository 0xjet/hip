Update 02/22: The IOC section has been updated](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/_vventura&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1614016792619000&usg=AOvVaw3e2giezUj2hb0nczAoIyF3)\n\n\n-----\n\nGamaredon is a threat actor, active since at least 2013, that has long been associated\nwith pro-Russian activities in several reports throughout the years. It is extremely\naggressive and is usually not associated with high-visibility campaigns, Cisco Talos\nsees it is incredibly active and we believe the group is on par with some of the most\nprolific crimeware gangs.\n\nIt has been considered an APT for a long time, however, its characteristics don't match\nthe common definition of an APT. We should consider the possibility of this not being\nan APT at all, rather being a group that provides services for other APTs, while doing\nits own attacks on other regions/victimology.\n\nContradicting the usual APT method of operation, Gamaredon does not have a focused\nvictimology and insteads targets users all over the globe.\n\nThis group is targeting everyone, from banks in Africa to educational institutions in the\nU.S.\n\nThe actor is not as stealthy as other major APT actors, and instead acts more like a\ncrimeware gang.\n\n## What's new?\n\nGamaredon has been exposed several times in multiple threat intelligence reports, without\nany significant effects on their operations. Their information-gathering activities can almost\nbe classified as a second-tier APT, whose main goal is to gather information and share it with\ntheir units, who will eventually use that information to perform the end goal.\n\n## How did it work?\n\nThe actor uses common tactics from the crimeware world, such as trojanized applications\ninstallers, self-extracting archives with common names and icons and spam emails with\nmalicious payloads, sometimes even using template injection. For an APT, this actor is\nextremely noisy with an infrastructure that goes well above 600 active domains for the first\nstage command and control (C2). This first-stage C2 is responsible for the delivery of the\nsecond stage and the update of the first stage, which can also update the second stage if\nneeded. By opposition, the second stage seems to be delivered with a detailed criteria,\nrather than sending it to all targets.\n\n## So what?\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations need to understand the threat actors they are more likely to be targeted by.\nClassification of the threat actors becomes important to optimize the limited defensive\nresources available. APT groups are often associated with focused, high-impact activities\nwith extremely small footprints leading to an extremely stealthy activity that's hard to detect.\nHowever, Gamaredon is the opposite of that — though it's still considered an APT actor. Our\nobjective is to help organizations understand how Gamaredon fits into the larger\ncybersecurity landscape. Rather than doing a fully comprehensive report about Gamaredon,\nwe focused our attention on four campaigns that started in 2020 and are still active today.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe APT group Gamaredon is one of the most active and undeterred actors in the threat\nlandscape. Gamaredon breaks the APT mold — they use a fairly large footprint across their\ncampaigns with a large number of domains used. This is similar to the TTPs normally\nassociated with crimeware groups that don't often overlap with APTs. Their activity has been\ndocumented several times over the years, but the group relentlessly continued their activities\nwithout showing any signs of slowing down or covert operations. This group controls more\nthan 600 domains, which they deploy at various points in the infection timeline. It's not often\nthat we see an APT group with such a large infrastructure that's been active for this long. A\n[similar, but smaller, example could be the Promethium group.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/06/promethium-extends-with-strongpity3.html)\n\nThis level of activity is excessively noisy for an APT actor. Gamaredon lacks the fluency and\neloquent techniques we see in some of the most advanced operations. There is also no\nindication the group profits off their victim's information, which differentiates them from the\nregular crimeware crews that monetize all information in different ways. This doesn't mean\nthat Gamaredon, as an APT, should be considered a minor threat. This should be seen as an\nexpansion of their activities to a broader victimology, increasing the likelihood of an\norganization being a target.\n\nThe activity of this group matches up with the activities of usual information-stealers on the\ncrimeware scene who steal information and then sell it to other threat actors — second-tier\nAPT actors that pass critical information to other top-tier teams within their operational unit.\nThe other possibility is Gamaredon is a \"service provider\" that also performs some side jobs,\nwhich would explain why they've targeted a major national bank in West Africa.\n\nThis is a group that, although it's very active and noisy in some campaigns, does take special\ncare to avoid certain victims. Some of their campaigns have a simple first stage, and secondstage delivery seems to be vetted based on the information received after first contact.\n\nThis is not a group that denotes a high level of technical expertise — their first stages seem\nto be designed to complete the job quickly without hiding its capabilities. This, however,\nshould not be taken as a lack of capability. This group has a huge infrastructure, more than\n\n\n-----\n\n600 active domains linked to their activities. Gamaredon often uses Windows Batch\nlanguage and/or Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) in their first stage. Sometimes, the first-stage\nfiles are created directly by the VisualBasic for Applications (VBA) macros embedded in the\nmalicious documents used as an initial vector. Later in this post, we'll walk through the details\nof some past campaigns from this actor over the past two years. Talos observed some new\ncampaigns as of February 2021 that show this actor evolves in small ways, but very often.\nThis, along with the size of the infrastructure, implies a dedicated development effort to allow\nthe actor to continue operating while adding new capabilities and features, alongside\nmanaging their infrastructure to support their campaigns.\n\n## Victimology and infrastructure\n\nAs we have established previously, Gamaredon is not the average APT. This is an extremely\naggressive group with little or no reduction in their activity, which is supported in a large\ninfrastructure not often seen on APT groups. In one of the analyzed campaigns, Gamaredon\nhas a list of IPs that won't be infected by their first stage. Overall, there are roughly 1,709 IP\naddresses from 43 different countries.\n\nIt is not clear why these IP addresses were avoided. However there are a few possibilities:\nSome are Tor, VPN or sandbox exit nodes, others may be sinkholes, while others could be\nlocated in \"friendly\" countries or providers. Regardless of the reason, the actor is aware that\ntheir malware can have a wide geographical dispersion, which is a clear indication of their\naggressiveness.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike other APTs, when we look into the several campaigns from Gamaredon, we can see\nthat their victimology is not geographically restricted to countries like Ukraine or the U.S. We\nbelieve Gamaredon has a particular interest in Ukrainian targets, as most of the themes used\nin their malicious emails and documents are written in Russian, attempting to imitate official\ndocuments from the Ukranian government. However, as the map below shows, active\nGamaredon implants date back to only Jan. 1, 2021.\n\nWhile Cisco Talos have unveiled a large amount of Gamaredon infrastructure, domains and\nother IOCs, it's likely Gamaredon continues to have additional infrastructure for other attacks\nthat are not yet discovered. This is not an exhaustive list, but we believe it to be a\ncomprehensive list for the campaigns we've analyzed. In one campaign, we list more than\n600 domains, but as of the time of writing, we know more have been registered. Over time,\nthese domains have used more than 330 different IP addresses across 16 countries. Of\nthose, more than 230 of the IPs had geolocation data from Russia. At the time of this writing,\nthese domains were distributed along just 36 IP addresses, from which 35 are located in\nRussia, and one is located in Germany.\n\n## List of campaigns\n\n### The most common technique\n\nAs often happens with Gamaredon campaigns, this one also uses template injection in Word\ndocuments as an initial attack vector, which are normally delivered via spear-phishing emails\n\n\n-----\n\nto the victim. This has been seen in previous campaigns and they continue to use different\nhosting sites. For sake of simplicity, we will focus the analysis on a single sample.\n\nThe Microsoft Word document is called \"НУЖНА ПОМОЩЬ.doc,\" which translates to \"need\nhelp.\" The document below is a lure the actor used. This is clearly written in Cyrillic text,\nnamely of Russian origin, and it states that a relative has been arrested by the Russian FSB\naccused of terrorism in occupied Crimea. Talos identified two documents with the same\nname but used as different hashes. This may be an attempt to avoid some simpler methods\nof anti-virus detection or hunting based on the hash value:\n\nd5d080a96b716e90ec74b1de5f42f26237ac959da9af7d09cce2548b5fc4473d (C2:\nhttp://word-expert[.]online:80/September/jtFqxxHzQAw.dot) and\n36ed18f16e5d279ec11da50bd4f0024edc234cccbd8a21e76abcfc44e2d08ff2\n\nIf the user opens the Word DOT template, the file is retrieved and loaded from the C2\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://email-smtp[.]online/sequence/hjnerkXCXrc.dot.\n\nThis template file contains an embedded VisualBasic for Applications macro that will decode\nbase64-encoded lines and write them to a file creating a VisualBasic script file (see image\nbelow), which is then executed.\n\nThis is the first stage of the malware. It starts by checking if the second stage is running, and\nif so, terminates all second-stage-related processes.\n\nThe request in the first beacon contains details about the victim host. The user-agent is\nhardcoded in the script as \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.87 Safari/537.36 OPR/54.0.2952.64,\" which is suffixed with a\nstring in the format: \"::computername_SystemDriveSerialNumber::/.invalid/.\" The system\ndrive serial number will be in hexadecimal format.\n\nThe path of the request starts with \"/ingenious_\", which will be appended with _procexp,\n_wireshark or _tcpdump if it finds those processes running on the system. It's then\nterminated by \"/28.01/ivan.php\".\n\nIf the first request fails, the malware will ping the system and send the request again. Finally,\nthe script will randomly sleep between 95 and 154 seconds, before contacting the stage one\nC2 again. The first-stage C2 will either reply with a new stage two binary or zero bytes.\n\nIn this case, even if the victim detects stage two, by then, a lot of information has already\nbeen stolen during the initial reconnaissance phase.\n\n### Lesser-used approach using trojanized installers\n\nGamaredon also adopted the trojanedised application method. A campaign using a trojaned\nZoom installer was first seen on Jan. 28, 2020. Gamaredon has not previously been known\nto use trojanised Windows applications to form part of their attack chain. Talos believes this\nis a first for Gamaredon. This can be seen from the Cisco Secure Malware Analytics\nsandbox execution below. Once the installer starts, it will launch to processes. One will start\nthe first stage of the malware, and the second is the real Zoom installer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first stage is a Windows batch file that creates a VBS similar to the previous one. This\ntime, the VBS will only exfiltrate the C drive serial number and there is no retry mechanism,\nnor is there a sleep time. When the batch finishes the creation of the VBS, it will create a\nscheduled task that starts 14 minutes after its been scheduled and will run again every 14\nminutes. This means that the beaconing of the first stage will be 14 minutes as a response to\nthe C2 that supplies the malware with a new stage two.\n\n### Using a huge script file to allude sandboxes\n\nThis campaign is linked with the first one we described above and the email used to register\nthe stage one C2. The C2 domain for this campaign was \"atlanticos.site,\" registered with the\nemail \"macrobit@inbox[.]ru.\" Refer to the victimology section for more information. This time,\nthe Gamaredon group made a 68MB Visual Basic Script that helps to bypass sandbox\ndetections. The script is made up of random strings that have been commented out.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter removing the comments, the script is pretty similar to the previous one. The first stage\nuses the hex representation of the system drive serial number as a filename for its\nexecutable, which will be replaced if it already exists. Unlike the first example, this sample\ndoes not have a loop to contact the C2. It will likely use an external triggering mechanism like\nthe task scheduler. The script has a total of 49,200 milliseconds of sleep split across three\ndifferent points of execution which should push the total amount of execution time to at least\n50 seconds. Also, unlike the first example, this one will only exfiltrate the system drive hexencoded serial number and the computer name.\n\n### Sample that avoids certain IPs\n\nThis campaign was first seen in 2018 but it's still active today.. As often happens with this\nthreat actor, it uses dynamic domains. Three domains we examined from this campaign have\nbeen active since 2018, swapping between periods of activity and dormancy, as shown in the\ntimeline below.\n\n\n-----\n\nLet's look at spr-d4.ddns[.]net as an example, which is a dynamic DNS domain. This domain\nhas pointed to three different IP addresses (195.62.53.158, 185.248.100.104,\n142.93.110.250) over the past three years. The first two, (in 2018-19) belong to the ASN\nIPSERVER-RU-NET, and the last one is from DIGITALOCEAN-ASN in the U.S. The\noperations on this campaign seem to have spun back up in the beginning of June 2019 and\nare still active today.\n\nSamples from this campaign vary in the campaign version, but the code is mostly identical.\nInstead of using VBS or VBA, the Gamaredon group uses Windows Batch language to build\nthe entire first stage. As in the trojan application campaign, it uses 7-Zip self-extracting\nfeatures to pack and launch the entire first stage into a single executable. This campaign is\nthe only one Talos has seen that includes a list of IP addresses which is used to avoid\ncertain victims, as can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis list consists of more than 1700 IP addresses that are distributed across 43 countries.\nWe identified different lists used in the same kind of campaign. These lists overlap in time\nand IP addresses. We identified two samples with different IP sets. Sample A (db2fd....39af1)\nwas first seen in the wild on April 21, 2018. This same sample was seen on Dec. 14, 2020\nwith the hash (8babd…..efe06), the hash changed because the version code changed.\nHowever the code and the IP address list are the same. Another sample (940ed…..e6dc0)\nbelonging to the same type of campaign was seen in the wild in 2019. This time, the code\nwas not exactly the same, but it was still quite similar. The IP list, however, was updated with\n179 additional IP addresses, mainly located in Germany. There is no obvious reason why the\n2020 sample didn't use the updated list. However, given the amount of simultaneous\ncampaigns, it wouldn't be surprising if this was simply a mistake.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nState-sponsored actors and APT groups are not necessarily the same. A state-sponsored\nactor can be defined as an APT that is supported in some way by a state. This does not\nautomatically make all APTs state-sponsored. APT actors that provide hacking-as-a-service\nare not necessarily a state-sponsored actor because they can't be tied to a specific state —\nthey will work for whoever pays the most. But this doesn't mean that they shouldn't be\nconsidered an APT. These lines get even blurrier when an actor has the characteristics and\nbehaviour we observe in Gamaredon. This is a group whose main interest has been\nespionage, without any indications of being interested in using crimeware techniques to\nmonetize their activity. Which should put them outside the crimeware gang definitions,\nhowever their behavior certainly resembles a crimware gang rather than an APT.\n\nWe believe Gamaredon has a very specific interest in Ukraine that dates back to its initial\ndiscovery in 2013. Gamaredon remains a prolific group that does not appear to be deterred\nthrough exposure of their activities since their inception in 2013. These new discoveries from\nTalos show a very diverse level of targeting with an almost crimeware-like approach. This\ngroup has targeted a major bank in Africa, U.S. educational facilities, European\ntelecommunications and hosting providers. The seemingly specific victimology of\nGamaredon is thrown into doubt, as we have uncovered a myriad of different vertices, not\nlimited to the above mentioned, and seemingly with a widespread approach that goes\nbeyond only Ukraine.\n\nGamaredon shows there is a space for the second-tier APT classification, one where the\nactor provides breach services to a larger actor, almost mimicking what happens in the\ncrimeware scene, where some groups just gather credentials which they then sell to other\ncrimeware groups. There are other groups that may offer hacking-as-a-service, but rather\nthan working for the highest bidder, they serve a specific country or group, perhaps to align\nwith their own intentions. At the same time, these groups will do whatever is best to\n\n\n-----\n\nmaximize their gains. The advantage in this case is that they benefit from the protection of\nthe APT for which they provide the services. Finally, this second-tier category should also\ninclude the APTs that lack the sophistication of others and often have their operations\nexposed due to bad opsec or amateuristic mistakes.\n\nWe believe that challenging the status quo on Gamaredon and others that could fit the\nprevious definition, is beneficial as a whole. It will help organizations better understand the\nthreats that they must focus their resources on. The fact remains Gamaredon remains a\nnotoriously prolific group operating without any constraints on a globally impacting level.\n\n### Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1614016792635000&usg=AOvVaw3jwmu78dvkFCNTGse4PMFl)\nmalware used by these threat actors.
