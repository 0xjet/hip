2017\n\n**[therecord.media/russian-hackers-breached-dutch-police-systems-in-2017/](https://therecord.media/russian-hackers-breached-dutch-police-systems-in-2017/)**\n\nJune 10, 2021\n\nHackers working on behalf of Russian intelligence services breached the internal network of\nDutch police in 2017 during the country’s investigation of the MH-17 crash.\n\nThe intrusion was kept under wraps by Dutch investigators until this week when multiple\n[sources revealed the incident to Dutch newspaper the Volkskrant.](https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/russen-zaten-ten-tijde-van-mh17-onderzoek-door-hack-diep-in-systemen-politie~b0e044e1/)\n\n## Breach occurred via Police academy server\n\nAccording to the newspaper’s reporting, the attack was traced back to September 2017,\nwhen Russian hackers used a vulnerability in an “exotic software” to breach a server\nbelonging to the Dutch Police Academy, from where they pivoted to the main Dutch police\nnetwork.\n\nThe intrusion was uncovered by AIVD, the Dutch intelligence service, after it saw a Dutch\npolice IP address communicating with known malicious servers operated by Russian statesponsored threat actors.\n\nThe AIVD, which [previously breached a Russian intelligence service itself in 2014, alerted](https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2213767-dutch-intelligence-first-to-alert-u-s-about-russian-hack-of-democratic-party)\nDutch police.\n\n\n-----\n\nVolkskrant said that due to a lack of monitoring/logging, the AIVD and Dutch Police have\nvery little knowledge of what the hackers did inside the police network.\n\nSources also described several moments of friction between the two Dutch agencies when it\ncame to deciding on how to handle the intrusion and subsequent clean-up, with the AIVD\nwanting to keep the hackers under surveillance while police officials wanted them removed\nfrom their systems due to the possibility of compromising sensitive cases.\n\n## Intrusion linked to Russian intelligence\n\n[Volkskrant said that sources linked the 2017 Dutch police hack to APT29 (Cozy Bear), a](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/apt_29)\nwell-known hacking group that the White House linked earlier this year to the Russian\nForeign Intelligence Service, also known as the SVR.\n\nHowever, in a subsequent article update, Volkskrant said that attribution of the hack is far\n[from accurate, as some sources also linked the attack to APT28 (Fancy Bear), a hacking](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/sofacy)\ngroup that was previously linked to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence service.\n\nNeither Dutch police nor the AIVD confirmed or commented on the newspaper’s reporting.\n\nEither way, investigators were positive the attack was carried out by Russian intelligence as\n[Dutch authorities were investigating the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17), which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17)\nthey concluded was downed by a missile shot by rogue Russian-backed rebel forces active\nin eastern Ukraine.\n\nDuring the investigation into the flight’s crash, which was led by Dutch authorities, several\nDutch organizations were targeted by both APT28 and APT29 on multiple occasions.\n\nAs part of the Russian government’s desperate attempts at gaining insights into the\ninvestigation, Russian intelligence agents also traveled to the Netherlands to hack a police\nstation and the [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a notorious](https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2018/10/04/netherlands-defence-intelligence-and-security-service-disrupts-russian-cyber-operation-targeting-opcw)\n[incident for which the EU imposed sanctions against the Russian intelligence agents in 2020.](https://therecord.media/eu-extends-sanctions-against-chinese-russian-and-n-korean-hackers-for-another-year/)\n\nTensions between Russia and the Netherlands remain high due to the MH-17 investigation.\n\nA recent [AIVD report claimed that Russia still ran influence operations in 2020, trying to](https://www.aivd.nl/onderwerpen/jaarverslagen/jaarverslag-2020/internationale-dreigingen-en-politieke-veiligheidsbelangen)\ndiscredit the findings of its MH-17 investigation.\n\nEarlier this year, the Netherlands also said it discovered and kicked out two SVR\nagents working at the Russian embassy in The Hague under diplomatic accreditation.\n\nDutch officials, [led by the AIVD, are also currently looking into making espionage a crime.](https://www.aivd.nl/onderwerpen/spionage/vraag-en-antwoord/waarom-is-spionage-nog-niet-strafbaar)\n\n\n-----\n\nTags\n\n\nFun fact: espionage, while a crime in many places, is not in any extradition treaties.\n\nThis causes some weird pretenses when country A might very much want to extradite\na person from country B �👀
