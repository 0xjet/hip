Candiru didn’t immediately respond to a message**\n**seeking comment.**\n\n**While the company’s current name is Saito Tech Ltd, we will refer to them as 'Candiru'**\n**as they are most well known by that name.**\n\n**Candiru is a secretive Israel-based company that sells spyware exclusively to**\n**governments. Reportedly, their spyware can infect and monitor iPhones, Androids,**\n**Macs, PCs, and cloud accounts.**\n\n**Citizen lab identified a politically active victim in Western Europe and recovered a**\n**copy of Candiru’s Windows spyware.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Microsoft observed at least 100 victims in Palestine, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen,**\n**Spain, United Kingdom, Turkey, Armenia, and Singapore. Victims include human**\n**rights defenders, dissidents, journalists, activists, and politicians.**\n\n**Here we will try a short brief on the technical overview of the Candiru spyware’s**\n**persistence mechanism and some details about the spyware’s functionality accordiing**\n**to a research by citizen lab. Candiru has made efforts to obscure its ownership**\n**structure, staffing, and investment partners.**\n\n**The company known as Candiru, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, is a mercenary spyware firm**\n**that markets untraceable spyware to government customers. Their product offering**\n**includes solutions for spying on computers, mobile devices, and cloud accounts.**\n\n**How to identify**\n\n**Candiru’s spyware was persistently installed on the computer via COM hijacking of**\n**the following registry key:**\n\n**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{CF4CC405-E2C5-4DDD-B3CE-**\n**5E7582D8C9FA}\\InprocServer32**\n\n**Normally, this registry key’s value points to the benign Windows Management**\n**Instrumentation wmiutils.dll file, but the value on the infected computer had been**\n**modified to point to a malicious DLL file that had been dropped inside the Windows**\n**system folder associated with the Japanese input method (IMEJP)**\n**C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\ime\\IMEJP\\IMJPUEXP.DLL.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This folder is benign and included in a default install of Windows 10, but**\n**IMJPUEXP.DLL is not the name of a legitimate Windows component.**\n\n**To identify the websites used by Candiru’s spyware, citizen lab developed four**\n**fingerprints and a new Internet scanning technique. They searched for the historical**\n**data from Censys and conducted their own scans in 2021.**\n\n**They identified at least 764 domain names that we assess with moderate-high**\n**confidence to be used by Candiru and its customers. Examination of the domain**\n**names indicates a likely interest in targets in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North**\n**America.**\n\n**A leaked Candiru project proposal published by TheMarker shows that Candiru’s**\n**spyware can be installed using a number of different vectors, including malicious**\n**links, man-in-the-middle attacks, and physical attacks.**\n\n**The Candiru systems operated from Saudi Arabia, Israel, UAE, Hungary, and**\n**Indonesia, among other countries.**\n\n**A vector named Sherlock is also offered, that they claim works on Windows, iOS, and**\n**Android. This may be a browser-based zero-click vector.**\n\n**Like many of its peers, Candiru appears to license its spyware by number of**\n**concurrent infections, which reflects the number of targets that can be under active**\n**surveillance at any one instant in time. Like NSO Group, Candiru also appears to**\n**restrict the customer to a set of approved countries.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**How it Works**\n\n**Using Internet scanning citizen lab identified more than 750 websites linked to**\n**Candiru’s spyware infrastructure. Among them, many domains masquerading as**\n**advocacy organizations such as Amnesty International, the Black Lives Matter**\n**movement, as well as media companies, and other civil-society themed entities.**\n\n**After analyzing the spyware with the help of Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center**\n**(MSTIC), it discovered the CVE-2021-31979 and CVE-2021-33771 by Microsoft, two**\n**privilege escalation vulnerabilities exploited by Candiru. Microsoft patched both**\n**vulnerabilities on July 13th, 2021.**\n\n**The IMJPUEXP DLL file has eight blobs in the PE resources section with identifiers**\n**102, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110. The DLL decrypts these using an AES key and IV**\n**that are hardcoded in the DLL. Decryption is via Windows CryptoAPI, using AES-256-**\n**CBC.**\n\n**When Windows boots, it automatically loads the Windows Management**\n**Instrumentation service, which involves looking up the DLL path in the registry key,**\n**and then invoking the DLL.**\n\n**IMJPUEXP.DLL decrypts and loads the AgentService.dat file whose path is in resource**\n**103, using the same AES key and IV, and decompresses it via zlib.**\n\n**AgentService.dat file then loads the file in resource 105, KBDMAORI.dat, using a**\n**second AES key and IV hardcoded in AgentService.dat, and performs the decryption**\n**using a statically linked OpenSSL.**\n\n**Decrypting KBDMAORI.DAT yields a file with a series of nine encrypted blobs, each**\n**prefixed with an 8-byte little-endian length field. Each blob is encrypted with the same**\n**AES key and IV used to decrypt KBDMAORI.DAT, and is then zlib compressed.**\n\n**Candiru’s Windows payload appears to include features for exfiltrating files, exporting**\n**all messages saved in the Windows version of the popular encrypted messaging app**\n**Signal, and stealing cookies and passwords from Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox,**\n**Safari, and Opera browsers.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Microsoft’s analysis also established that the spyware could send messages from**\n**logged-in email and social media accounts directly on the victim’s computer.**\n\n**This could allow malicious links or other messages to be sent directly from a**\n**compromised user’s computer. Proving that the compromised user did not send the**\n**message could be quite challenging.**\n\n**Candiru spyware is part of a thriving private industry selling technology to**\n**governments and authoritarian leaders so they can gain access to the**\n**communications of private citizens and political opposition.**\n\n**Another Israeli company, NSO Group Ltd., has been accused of providing spyware to**\n**repressive governments that have used it to snoop on journalists and activists.**\n\n**NSO has maintained that it sells its technology exclusively to governments and law**\n**enforcement as a tool against terrorism and crime. In a report published on June 30,**\n**the Group said it refuses to sell spyware to 55 countries and has taken steps to curb**\n**misuse by customers.**\n\n**For 16 million euros ($18.9 million), Candiru’s clients can attempt to compromise an**\n**unlimited number of devices but are limited to actively tracking only 10 at a time,**\n**according to Citizen Lab. For an extra 1.5 million euro ($1.8 million), buyers can**\n**monitor an additional 15 victims.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Candiru has clients in Europe, Russia, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America,**\n**according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Local news organizations have reported**\n**contracts in Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Qatar,**\n**according to Citizen Lab’s report.**\n\n**Candiru’s clients are restricted to operating only in agreed upon territories, according**\n**to Citizen Lab. The company’s clients sign contracts that limit operations outside the**\n**U.S., Russia, China, Israel and Iran, according to the report.**\n\n**These contents are created by advertisers and are not related with Eyes on Life.**\n\n\n-----",
