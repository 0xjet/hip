As a\nlong-established family of ransomware, Shade has been in operation since 2014, and has\nbeen operating consistently ever since.\n\nIn late April 2020, its operators announced that they are stopping the Shade operation and\npublicly released around 750,000 decryption keys hinting that cyber-security companies\nshould build a better decryptor than theirs.\n\n**TL;DR, just show me the download**\n\nYou can download the decryptor here to get your files back for free.\n\n[mks_button size=”large” title=”Download the Shade Ransomware decryption tool”\nstyle=”squared” url=”https://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/shadetroldesh-decryption-tool/” target=”_self” bg_color=”#81d742″ txt_color=”#FFFFFF” icon=””\nicon_type=”” nofollow=”0″]\n\nIf you are interested in how the tool works, we have more information below.\n\n**Technical description:**\n\nThis tool recovers files encrypted by Shade/Troldesh ransomware. While it might be easy for\nthe untrained eye to mistake it with Crysis/Dharma ransomware, Shade is quite different in\nseveral ways. One can tell this ransomware family and version apart by the extension it\nappends to the encrypted files, by some 10 similar ransom-notes or by the way encrypted\nfiles are named (base64):\n\nExtensions used for encrypted file names:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n.xtbl\n.ytbl\n.breaking_bad\n.heisenberg\n.better_call_saul\n.los_pollos\n.da_vinci_code\n.magic_software_syndicate\n.windows10\n.windows8\n.no_more_ransom\n.tyson\n.crypted000007\n.crypted000078\n.rsa3072\n.decrypt_it\n.dexter\n.miami_california\n\n```\nRansom-notes:\n\nUser Ids, required for key match, are also found in encrypted file names, for most\nransomware sub-versions. For older versions of the malware, the ID can be recovered from\nransom-notes, or by brute-forcing the limited set of released keys.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy default malware comes with some public RSA3072 keys, which are used to encrypt files,\nif no server responds within several hours. The authors released the entire set of encryption\nkeys used in all malware versions in a public Github repository.\n\nWhile victims whose systems could successfully connect to server would have custom\nencryption keys, those who got infected with no active connection would have been\nencrypted by hardcoded RSA public keys.\n\nThe set of dynamic generated keys and uploaded to ransomware owner servers take up to\n1.8GB (~749K), the static shipped private keys are are only 1.6K in size, and do not exceed\n4MB.\n\nOur decryption tool is able to identify on the fly corresponding keys, cache them, and apply\nfaster on subsequent decryption attempts. The tool does not require any additional input\nfrom the user in order to decrypt. It requires an active internet connection to compute the\ndynamic keys, should files have been infected in online mode.\n\n**How to use this tool**\n\n**Step 1: Download the decryption tool below and save it on your computer.**\n\n[Download the Shade decryptor](https://download.bitdefender.com/am/malware_removal/BDShadeDecryptor.exe)\n\n_Note: This tool REQUIRES an active internet connection, as our servers will attempt to reply_\n_the submitted ID with a possible valid RSA-3072 private key. If this step succeeds, the_\n_decryption process will continue._\n\n**Step 2: Double-click the file (previously saved as BDParadiseDecryptor.exe ) and allow it to**\nrun by clicking Yes in the UAC prompt.\n\n**Step 3: Agree to the End User License Agreement**\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of this step, your files should have been decrypted.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please contact us via the e-mail address specified inside the\ntool.\n\nIf you checked the backup option, you will have both the encrypted and decrypted files at the\nend of the process. You may also find a log describing decryption process in\n%temp%\\BDRemovalTool folder:\n\nTo get rid of your left encrypted files, just search for files matching the extension and remove\nthem in bulk. We do not encourage you to do this, until you double-check your files can be\nopened safely and there is no trace of damage.\n\n**Do not remove large files, as their decryption may be tricky, and we may have some**\n**updates for specific cases where decryption may have failed.**\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\n_This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project, for use in the OpenSSL_\n_Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)_\n\n**TAGS**\n\n\n-----\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/) [free tools](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/free-tools/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Bitdefender\n\nThe meaning of Bitdefender’s mascot, the Dacian Draco, a symbol that depicts a mythical\nanimal with a wolf’s head and a dragon’s body, is “to watch” and to “guard with a sharp eye.”\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/bitdefenderteam/)\n\n\n## Bitdefender\n\nThe meaning of Bitdefender’s mascot, the Dacian Draco, a symbol that depicts a mythical\nanimal with a wolf’s head and a dragon’s body, is “to watch” and to “guard with a sharp eye.”\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/bitdefenderteam/)\n\n\n-----",
