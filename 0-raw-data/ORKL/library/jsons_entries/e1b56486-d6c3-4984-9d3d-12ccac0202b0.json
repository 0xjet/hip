Self-named the ‘Eternity Project’, this cyber threat group offers services from a Tor\nwebsite and on their Telegram channel. They sell a wide variety of malware in an organized\nfashion, including stealer, clipper, worm, miner, ransomware and distributed-denial-of-service\nbot services.\n\nThis alarms many security professionals. With Eternity, even inexperienced cyber criminals\ncan target victims with a customized threat offering. Eternity sells malware for $90 to $490.\nAs Malware-as-a-Service grows in sophistication, it’s easier than ever to access attack tools\nat low prices.\n\n## Malware for Sale on Telegram\n\nAccording to [Cyble, Eternity Project offers a wide variety of malware services on its Telegram](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/05/12/a-closer-look-at-eternity-malware/)\nchannel, which has around 500 subscribers. The channel provides detailed information about\nthe service’s features and even uses explainer videos. Eternity Project’s Telegram channel\nalso shares news about their malware’s updates, just like any brand showcasing new\nfeatures.\n\n_Source: Cyble_\n\n## Eternity Project Stealer\n\nWhat kind of damage can Eternity Project’s malware do? One example is Eternity Stealer.\nThis malware lets users steal passwords, cookies, credit cards and crypto wallets from\ntargets to later receive the stolen data directly on the Telegram bot.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe features of the stealer malware mentioned on the group s Telegram channel include:\n\nBrowsers collection (passwords, credit cards, cookies, autofill, tokens, history,\nbookmarks)\nChrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Chromium, Vivaldi, IE and other browsers\nEmail clients: Thunderbird, Outlook, FoxMail, PostBox and MailBird.\n\nIt also offers ways to break into messenger apps, password managers and more.\n\nAccording to the report, customers can build Eternity Stealer malware directly on the\nTelegram bot. Once the user selects a stealer product, options appear to add features such\nas AntiVM and AntiRepeat. Next, the user selects the available payload file extension such\nas .exe, .scr, .com or pif. Finally, users can download the exfiltrated payload directly from the\nTelegram channel.\n\nOther services such as miner, clipper, ransomware and worm offer the same kind of\nconvenience and customization. And it all occurs through an easy-to-use Telegram Q&A bot:\n\n_Source: Cyble_\n\n## Malware-as-a-Service Growth\n\n\n-----\n\nThe researchers state that they have seen a major increase in cyber crime through Telegram\nchannels and forums. Threat groups are selling their products in the open without any type of\nsanction.\n\n[A large part of the success of these groups is their businesslike approach. They employ an](https://securityintelligence.com/news/cyber-criminal-justice-system-resolves-disputes/)\nagile development framework to develop malware. Later they go online to test their products\non a victim, then they return to the lab to work out the bugs. They also implement advanced\nmarketing techniques and place an emphasis on user experience and user interface.\n\n## Thwarting Malware Attacks\n\n[The authors of the threat report suggest some ways to mitigate malware. For example, it’s](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/ransomware-attacks-gangs-2022/)\nimportant to keep backups of all critical files. These backups should be kept offline or on\ncompletely separate networks. Turn on automatic software updates, and have security teams\nscan often for warnings and updates about mission-critical software.\n\nThe official [CISA Stop Ransomware site also provides in-depth guidance against malware.](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware)\n\n[Jonathan Reed](https://securityintelligence.com/author/jonathan-reed/)\nFreelance Technology Writer\n\nJonathan Reed is a freelance technology writer.
