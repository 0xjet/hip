After analyzing this threat](https://repnz.github.io/posts/autochk-rootkit-analysis/)\nand describing its capabilities, he has rewritten the source code from a sample of this threat\nuploaded in 2018 to Virustotal, and published it in GitHub, which greatly facilitates the\nanalysis of newer versions. As he describes in his blog, the capabilities of this Rootkit are\nbasically the following:\n\n**File Redirection – Redirect malicious files to benign files. If you try to call CreateFile()**\nto open a malicious file you’ll get a handle to a benign file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Network Connection Hiding – Hide network connections from tools like**\nnetstat,proceshacker…\n\nWe found interesting to analyze the differences between the 2018 version and the most\nrecent 2019 version in order to try to identify new capabilities or changes in its capabilities.\nAfter comparing both samples using the GitHub source code, we have been able to see that\nmost of the functions are identical, except for 5 of them (including the Driver’s entrypoint):\n\nIdentical functions in both versions\n\nDifferent functions\n\nAfter analyzing the differences between this 5 funtcions, we have been able to observe that\nall the changes are focused on avoiding detections by slightly “obfuscating” some IOCs\nhardcoded as strings and code modification without impact in the capabilities on the driver…\n\nIn total, there are three notable changes between the two versions:\n\nThe first one basically consists in that they have reversed the list of strings that identify\nthe files that the Driver hides by default when it is loaded:\n\n\n-----\n\nOld and New list of file names\nAt code level, the impact this has had is that the function that redirects these files, now uses\nthe “wcrev” function that flips the strings before passing them to the function that hides the\nfiles:\n\nNew code (Red) and old code (Green)\n\n\n-----\n\nSecondly, they have tried to disguise their use of the undocumented Microsoft API\n“ObReferenceObjectByName”, which is used to get the pointer to the different\nDriver_Object drivers they intend to hook in each case. Until now, they had the name of\nthis function in their strings, and used it to resolve it by passing its name to the\nMmGetSystemRoutineAddress API which returns a pointer to it. Now they only keep\npart of the name, and complete the rest in a slightly more complex way before calling\nMmGetSystemRoutineAddress by building it from characters they store in the registers\nand other areas of the binary:\n\n_New code (Red) and old code (Green)_\n\nFinally, they have moved part of the logic of some functions to another point,\nmaintaining the same functionality. An example is the end of the driver entry function,\nwhere untill now, at the end they only called two functions that initialized the logic of\nhiding connections and redirecting files, and now, they have extracted part of the logic\nof these functions and moved it right after each one of them, but without any impact on\nthe capabilities and behavior of the Driver:\n\n_New code (Red) and old code (Green)_\n\n\nx64\nSample\n\n\n42eab05c611bf24d86bb6c985caa2ad7380ed7d98340c7f08de9361be14dc244\n\n\n-----\n\nx86\nSample\n\n\n9b7c1e37d5f56cc0b5e5e22ce9805e237a189297e78405b9c392a0953b6e0321\n\n\n-----",
