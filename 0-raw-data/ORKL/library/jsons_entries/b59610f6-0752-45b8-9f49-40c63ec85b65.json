    "plain_text": "# New tools uncovered from hacking group APT15\n\n_RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS backdoors discovered by NCC Group_\n\nNCC Group has discovered two previously unknown backdoors used by the elusive hacker\ngroup APT15, providing unique insight into its methods. The group is also known as K3chang,\nMirage, Vixen Panda, GREF and Playful Dragon.\n\nThe global cyber security and risk mitigation expert was able to track the movements of the\ngroup over more than a year by decoding more than 200 commands from several\ncompromised hosts, in turn understanding how APT15 uses bespoke tools to target victims.\n\nIn this instance, the attackers targeted a global company that provides multiple services to UK\ngovernment. The attackers operated within the victim’s network from May 2016 until late 2017,\ncompromising over 30 hosts during that period. APT15 were targeting information related to\nUK government departments and sensitive communication technology.\n\nBy using the open-source tool Mimikatz, the attackers were able to gain domain administrator\ncredentials aiding them in later stealing a VPN certificate which they used to access the\nvictim’s network remotely.\n\nAPT15 was then able to deploy three backdoors – BS2005, which has previously been\ndocumented by cyber security company FireEye, as well as RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS, which\nhave not been discussed publically before. By looking at the reuse of this code, NCC Group\nresearchers were able to link these backdoors to the same threat actor.\n\nThe RoyalCLI backdoor is similar to BS2005 in that it uses Windows command prompt\n(cmd.exe) to execute most of its commands. However, by copying the default cmd.exe and\npatching it, RoyalCLI is able to bypass policy settings that disable running of command prompt\non the host machine.\n\nIn contrast, the RoyalDNS backdoor takes commands, runs them, then returns output using\nDNS. It differs from the other two backdoors found on the victim’s network in that it installs\nitself persistently and communicates over DNS rather than HTTP.\n\nOnce inside the victim’s network, the group was able to extract and collect information in\nmultiple ways. The group used a tool called Comma Separated Value Data Exchange (CSVDE),\nwhich can export data in bulk from Microsoft Windows Active Directory, as well as Bulk Copy\n\n\n-----\n\ndatabases.\n\nThese methods were combined with bespoke tools to extract information from Microsoft\nSharepoint and Microsoft Exchange. In the case of the Microsoft Sharepoint tool the binary\nincluded hard coded project names that were specific to the victim.\n\nAhmed Zaki, senior malware researcher at NCC Group, said: “Through our investigation we\nwere able to identify and monitor the attack process from start to finish, offering us unique\ninsight into the behaviour of this group. It’s clear to see that this is a highly sophisticated threat\nactor that has no problem writing tools which are specific to its victims”.\n\n“Knowledge sharing in the security industry is vital in order to improve the security posture and\ncapabilities of the sector and UK as a whole. Discussing these types of insights is therefore\nnecessary to ensure that we’re always able to understand and adapt to an ever-increasing\nvariety of threats.”\n\nENDS\n\n**Published date: 10 March 2018**\n\n[(https://twitter.com/share)](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n**0 Comments** **[NCC Group](https://disqus.com/home/forums/nccgroup/)** [1](https://disqus.com/home/inbox/) **Login**\n\n\n Recommend\n\n\n### ⤤ Share Sort by Oldest\n\n\n### Start the discussion…\n\n\n**LOG IN WITH**\n**OR SIGN UP WITH DISQUS**\n\n\nName\n\n\nBe the first to comment.\n\n✉ **Subscribe** d **[Add Disqus to your siteAdd DisqusAdd](https://publishers.disqus.com/engage?utm_source=nccgroup&utm_medium=Disqus-Footer)** � **[Privacy](https://disqus.com/)**\n\n**Filter By Service**\n\nSoftware Escrow & Verification\n\n\n-----\n\nRisk Management & Governance\n\n[Website Performance](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/website-performance-rss-feed/)\n\nSoftware Testing\n\nCorporate\n\nBusiness Insights\n\nCareers\n\n**Filter By Date**\n\n[2018 (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2018)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2018)\n\n[March (1) (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2018&Month=3)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2018&Month=3)\n\n[February (1) (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2018&Month=2)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2018&Month=2)\n\n[January (7) (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2018&Month=1)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2018&Month=1)\n\n[2017 (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2017)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2017)\n\n[2016 (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2016)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2016)\n\n[2015 (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2015)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2015)\n\n[2014 (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2014)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/?Year=2014)\n\n## Call us on: +44(0)161 826 5867 (tel:+441618265867)\n\nNewsroom & Events\n\n[In the media (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/in-the-media/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/in-the-media/)\n[News (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/news/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/news/)\n[Press Releases (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/)\n[Events (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/events/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/events/)\n[Blogs (/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/)\n\nAbout Us\n\n[History (/uk/about-us/what-we-do/history/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/what-we-do/history/)\n\n\n-----\n\ncommittee/)\n[Careers (/uk/about-us/careers/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/careers/)\n[Resources (/uk/about-us/resources/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/resources/)\n[Office Locations (/uk/about-us/what-we-do/office-locations/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/what-we-do/office-locations/)\n\n©2018 NCC Group.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nInvestor Relations\n\n[Share Price (/uk/about-us/investor-relations/share-price/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/investor-relations/share-price/)\n[Results & Presentations (/uk/about-us/investor-relations/results-and-presentations/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/investor-relations/results-and-presentations/)\nStock Exchange Announcements (/uk/about-us/investor-relations/stock-exchangeannouncements/)\n\nLegal\n\n[Terms & Conditions (/uk/about-us/terms-and-conditions/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/terms-and-conditions/)\n[Privacy Policy (/uk/about-us/privacy-policy/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/privacy-policy/)\n[Cookie Policy (/uk/about-us/privacy-policy/cookie-policy/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/privacy-policy/cookie-policy/)\n[Accessibility (/uk/about-us/accessibility/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/accessibility/)\n[Sitemap (/uk/sitemap/)](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/sitemap/)\n\n[Latest from @NCCGroupplc (https://twitter.com/NCCGroupplc)](https://twitter.com/NCCGroupplc)\n\n\n## \n\n\nCOOK, a provider of high-quality frozen meals, suspected that slow load times were negatively\naffecting its business.
