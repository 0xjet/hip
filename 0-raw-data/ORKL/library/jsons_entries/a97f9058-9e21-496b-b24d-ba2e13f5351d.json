Since then, our](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/security-advisory-a-risk-based-approach-for-improving-your-cybersecurity-posture-due-to-the-invasion-of-ukraine?hsLang=en-us)\n[Threat Intelligence (TI) and](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/) [Managed Detection and Response (MDR) teams have been actively monitoring the situation and identifying active](https://www.bitdefender.com/business/enterprise-products/managed-detection-response-service.html)\nthreats. Not surprisingly, the highest risk group contains businesses and organizations located in Ukraine, especially government entities and\ncritical infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nO e o t e g oups act e y e gaged p o uss a cybe attac s s U C 0056 s g oup as bee act e s ce at east a c 0, a d ts\nprimary objective seems to be cyber espionage with a focus on key state sectors. Other names for this group are Lorec53, UNC2589,\nEmberBear, LorecBear, BleedingBear, SaintBear, and TA471.\n\nThis group has been associated with attacks using OutSteel and GraphSteel stealers (malicious software designed to steal data). OutSteel\nwas written in the AutoIt language, while GraphSteel was written in the Go language (often referred to as Golang). While both languages are\nknown for their ease of use, AutoIt is a simpler language often used by system administrators and scripters. The behavior of Go-based\nGraphSteel is also more sophisticated – while its primary purpose is harvesting credentials, it is also trying to exfiltrate the most common\narchives and Office formats like .docx or .xlsx and locate sensitive files like .ssh, .crt, .key, .ovpn, or .json.\n\nDue to the inclusion of media files with extensions like .jpg, .png, .gif, .webp, .avi, .mkv, .mpg, .mpeg, and .3gp, GraphSteel limits its\nsearches to files that are 50 MB or smaller. While there are certain similarities between OutSteel and GraphSteel, there is not a clear\nconnection between them currently. [The original announcement by the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA)](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37704)\nregarding GraphSteel indicates an average level of certainty for attribution to UAC-0056.\n\nFor the rest of this report, we will focus on attacks involving the use of GraphSteel malware. GraphSteel is part of the Elephant Framework – a\ncollection of tools also written in the Go language and deployed in a recent wave of phishing attacks on .gov.ua targets. Recently, three\ndifferent attacks have been observed which relied on the Elephant Framework:\n\n[February 11th, 2022 – SentinelOne detected an attack with fake dictionary software](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/threat-actor-uac-0056-targeting-ukraine-with-fake-translation-software/)\n[March 11th, 2022 – CERT-UA reported an attack with fake antivirus software](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37704)\n[March 28th, 2022 – CERT-UA reported an attack with an “Unpaid wages” email subject](https://cert.gov.ua/article/38374)\n\n## Anatomy of an Attack\n\nIn all known Elephant Framework attacks, the spear-phishing tactic was used for initial compromise. The group demonstrated a good\nknowledge of social engineering techniques, with emails originating from spoofed Ukrainian email addresses. Email subject and body would\noften use trending themes (COVID) or use official-looking text.\n\nIn one of the emails, the threat actor included recommendations for effective security controls after warning about intensified computer attacks\nby the Russian Federation, including recommendations to use email and web traffic filtering, avoid the use of 3rd party DNS servers, and\nprovide a briefing to employees about possible phishing attacks. This “helpful” email cleverly embedded a link to a malicious payload\n(masquerading as a recommended antivirus tool).\n\nA few different techniques were used to execute the malicious launcher. In this example, the link to the malicious download is included in the\nbody of the email. In other cases, an attached Excel spreadsheet with embedded macros was used.\n\n### Launcher Component\n\n[There are a few different variants of launchers for GraphSteel that we have seen to date. In the case reported by SentinelOne, the](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/threat-actor-uac-0056-targeting-ukraine-with-fake-translation-software/)\n[downloaded launcher was a Python script converted to an executable (using pyinstaller). In the other cases, the launcher was written in the Go](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)\nlanguage like the rest of the Elephant Framework with the launcher’s name varying depending on the attack.\n\nWhy might threat actors choose the Go language, which is not a mainstream programming language, for this malicious software? Potential\nreasons include:\n\nSome security vendors may struggle to detect malware written in the Go language given its less frequent use\nThe payload can be compiled for both Windows and Linux (without code changes)\nIt is easy to use and can be expanded by 3rd party modules\n\nAfter analyzing the GraphSteel code, we identified references to other community modules used by the Elephant Framework; for example, for\n[AES cipher,](https://github.com/jcmturner/aescts) [generating a unique client ID, or](https://github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid) [Coldfire (a malware development framework for Golang).](https://github.com/redcode-labs/Coldfire)\n\nThe launcher does not have the malware payload embedded – instead, it acts as a combination of a downloader and dropper. Upon execution,\nthe launcher connects to the command and control (C&C) server, downloads the malware payload encoded as base64 string, saves it to the\nlocal disk and then executes it. The address of the C&C server is hardcoded in this executable and, in all recorded cases, the file dropped by\nthis executable is named Java-sdk.exe.\n\n### Downloader Component\n```\nJava-sdk.exe acts as a downloader of the Elephant Framework and, as you probably are expecting by now, is written in the Go language. It\n\n```\nuses a similar technique as the launcher – first connecting to a C&C server, then streams a string encoded in base64 which contains the\nmalicious payload, saves it as an executable to disk, and executes it. The address of the C&C server is not embedded – it is provided by the\nlauncher as a base64(AES(<C&C>)) argument. Two different malware files are downloaded – GraphSteel (Microsoft-cortana.exe) and\nGrimPlant (Oracle-java.exe) which are automatically executed. GrimPlant is a relatively simple backdoor that allows remote execution of\nPowerShell commands. GraphSteel is used for data exfiltration of credentials, certificates, passwords, and other sensitive information.\n\n\n-----\n\ns do oade co po e t s a so espo s b e o estab s g pe s ste ce by c eat g a eg st y a ue Ja a S u de t e eg st y ey\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\. \n\n```\n_Typical flow of an attack based on the Elephant Framework_\n\nThis covers our findings for the initial phase where the Elephant Framework is deployed to the compromised machine. In the next section, we\nwill look in more detail at the core components of the Elephant Framework, GrimPlant and GraphSteel. Both implants are written in the Go\n[language, comprehensive research is available from Intezer.](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/elephant-malware-targeting-ukrainian-orgs/)\n\n### GrimPlant (Backdoor) Component\n\nGrimPlant’s primary purpose is to allow a threat actor to execute PowerShell commands remotely. The address of the C&C server is provided\nby Java-sdk.exe using the command line parameter -addr. This address is not provided in plain text, instead, it uses the same\n```\nbase64(AES(<C&C>)) syntax as the downloader.\n\n```\n[Communication with the C&C server uses port 80 and is based on gRPC – an open-source Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework,](https://grpc.io/)\noriginally designed by Google. The communications are encrypted with TLS, with the certificate hardcoded in the binary.\n\nAfter establishing a connection to the C&C server, GrimPlant sends a heartbeat message every 10 seconds. Included in the heartbeat\nmessage is information about the infected endpoint (uploadSystemInfo function):\n\nOperating System – Hostname, operating system, number of CPUs\nIP Address – Runs a query to api.ipify.org to retrieve a public IP address\n\nUser Info – Name, username, HomeDir\n\nThis malware and its heartbeat message run in an infinite loop, waiting to receive commands from the C&C server and execute them using\n```\nPowerShell.exe.\n\n### GraphSteel (Stealer) Component\n\n```\nGraphSteel’s primary purpose is to exfiltrate data from infected machines. The address of the C&C server is retrieved using the same method\nas GrimPlant. All communication is encrypted using the AES cipher on port 443. To communicate with the C&C server, it uses WebSockets\nand the GraphQL query language.\n\nBelow are the functions used by this malware:\n\n**getFileHash() – Checks if the file has been uploaded on the server**\n**getPublicKey() – Generates a random public key and receives a secret used to derive an AES key for subsequent communication**\n**uploadChunk() – Uploads files in chunks**\n\n**i** **()** S d li t ID t th C&C\n\n\n-----\n\n**up oadSyste** **o()** Up oads o at o about t e ected ac e Sa e p e e tat o as G a t\n**uploadCredentials() – Uploads credentials harvested from an infected machine**\n\nThe malware runs two routines to communicate with the C&C server:\n\nHeartbeat every 20 seconds\nExfiltration routine every 20 minutes\n\nThe exfiltration routine:\n\nSends information about the infected system using the uploadSystemInfo() function\nExfiltrates files using uploadChunk() function\n\nFiles are exfiltrated from folders Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Desktop and from all available drives (D:\\ to Z:\\)\nLimited to files that are smaller than 50 MBs and have one of the following extensions: .txt, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx,\n```\n      .pptx, .ovpn, .ssh, .zip, .rar, .7z, .jpg, .png, .gif, .webp, .avi, .mkv, .mpg, .mpeg, .3gp, .csv, .json,\n      .crt, .key\n\n```\nHarvests credentials and exfiltrates them using the uploadCredentials() function. Credentials and other sensitive information are\nextracted using different methods and from various locations:\n\nWifi passwords\nChrome and Firefox credentials\nCredentials from the password vault\nCredentials from Windows Credentials Manager\nSSH sessions from Putty, Mobaxterm, openSSH, and Filezilla\nThunderbird\n\nExfiltration of wifi passwords is done by parsing output from netsh wlan show profiles, followed by netsh wlan show profile name=\n```\n<name> key=clear. \n\n```\nCredentials from a password vault are extracted by parsing the output from following PowerShell command: ([void]\n```\n[Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault,Windows.Security.Credentials,ContentType=WindowsRuntime];$vault = New-Object\nWindows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault;$vault.RetrieveAll() | % { $_.RetrievePassword();$_} | Select UserName,\nResource, Password | Format-Table –HideTableHeaders\n\n## When one payload is not enough\n\n```\nThe analyzed incidents mentioned in the first section of this article above are based on the Elephant Framework and use the same kill chain,\n[except for an incident involving a faked copy of Bitdefender software. On March 11th, 2022, a phishing campaign was reported by CERT-UA](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37704)\nthat included instructions to download a fake Bitdefender antivirus product.\n\n_The original phishing email. Source: CERT-UA_\n\nBelow is the full text of this phishing email (loosely translated from Ukrainian):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\naggression of the Russian Federation.\nUnder the Law of Ukraine \"On Protection of Information in Information and Telecommunication Systems\" based on the\ndecision of The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine dated 06.03.2022, the State Service of Special\nCommunications together with the Security Service of Ukraine, with the financial support of the Government of France,\nare taking measures to strengthen information security.\nTo eliminate threats to the state security of Ukraine and ensure the protection of information resources of authorities,\norganizations, and institutions of all forms of ownership, the following recommendations must be followed:\n   Install additional critical security updates for the Microsoft Windows operating system with a pre-installed\n   certified antivirus available for download from the official Bitdefender website;\n   Use SBU-certified up-to-date antivirus on all computers;\n   Filter incoming e-mails on the e-mail server for the presence of spam messages, as well as e-mails containing\n   attachments of the following types: exe, bat, cpl, dll, jar, msi, scr, etc .;\n   Filter incoming web traffic using content filters for social networks, entertainment sites, and other potentially\n   dangerous resources;\n   Brief employees on the possible \"phishing\" attacks;\n   Avoid the use of third-party DNS servers;\n   Familiarize the responsible employees with the provided instructions.\nResponsibility for failure to comply with the above recommendations rests with the authorities, organizations, and\ninstitutions of all forms of ownership.\nTo organize cooperation in the investigation of computer incidents, contact the leading specialist of the State Special\nService <REDACTED>.\n\n```\nThe link to the “official Bitdefender website” points to the domain forkscenter[.]fr. This phishing site spoofs the website bitdefender.fr, a\nversion of the Bitdefender website localized in the French language.\n\n_The fake Bitdefender.fr website.

With\nother campaigns, the file BitdefenderWindowsUpdatePackage.exe would have likely been a launcher, only responsible for the initial\ndeployment of Elephant Framework. In this case, a parallel deployment was also triggered with a different payload. The initial executable\ndeployed a Discord downloader, Alt.exe, which in turn deployed two executables. The first is a familiar Go launcher that deployed the rest of\nthe Elephant Framework as described earlier. The second executable, One.exe, is a Cobalt Strike Beacon, which deployed another Discord\ndownloader, wisw.exe. Persistence was established by creating a startup link called BitdefenderControl.lnk, which executes wisw.exe.\nFinally, the malware downloads another executable, cesdf.exe, from Discord. Unfortunately, this file is not available for analysis, as the\ndownload server was shut down. While the Elephant Framework deployment used hxxp://45[.]84.0.116:443 as the C&C server, the Cobalt\nStrike deployment used the C&C server located at nirsoft[.]me.\n\n_Overview of two parallel deployments associated with the spoofed AV attack_\n\n## Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nThe best protection against modern cyber-attacks is a defense-in-depth architecture. Start with reducing your attack surface and employing\nautomated controls to prevent most security incidents. For the few incidents that get through your defenses, you want to lean on security\noperations, either in-house or through a managed service, and leverage strong detection and response tools.\n\nIntegrated reputation services can stop an attack during multiple stages – from an initial phishing email, through the execution of a previously\nunknown payload, through to the successful compromise and subsequent call home to a C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\ntde e de eat te ge ce ( ) s suc a eputat o se ce a d ca be teg ated t you e st g secu ty ast uctu e us g t e S\nAPI.
