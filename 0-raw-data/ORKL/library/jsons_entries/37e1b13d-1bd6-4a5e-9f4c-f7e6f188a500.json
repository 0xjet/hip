These malicious applications were initially distributed through both Google\nPlay and third-party application stores. Zimperium zLabs reported the findings to Google,\nwho verified the provided research and removed the malicious applications from the Google\n\n\n-----\n\nPlay store. However, the malicious applications are still available on third-party, unsecured\napp repositories, highlighting the risk of sideloaded applications to mobile endpoints and\nuser data.\n\n_Disclosure: As a key member of the Google App Defense Alliance, Zimperium scans_\n_applications prior to publishing, as well as providing ongoing analysis of Android apps in the_\n_Google Play Store._\n\nIn this threat blog, we will:\n\nCover the capabilities of the FlyTrap Trojan;\nDiscuss the techniques used to collect and store data;\nDemonstrate the communication with the C&C server to exfiltrate stolen data; and\nExplore the victimology and impact.\n\n## What Can FlyTrap Trojan Do?\n\nThe mobile application poses a threat to the victim’s social identity by hijacking their\nFacebook accounts via a Trojan infecting their Android device. The information collected\nfrom the victim’s Android device includes:\n\nFacebook ID\nLocation\nEmail address\nIP address\nCookie and Tokens associated with the Facebook account\n\nThese hijacked Facebook sessions can be used to spread the malware by abusing the\nvictim’s social credibility through personal messaging with links to the Trojan, as well as\npropagating propaganda or disinformation campaigns using the victim’s geolocation details.\nThese social engineering techniques are highly effective in the digitally connected world\nand are used often by cybercriminals to spread malware from one victim to another.\n\n## How Does FlyTrap Trojan Work?\n\nThe threat actors made use of several themes that users would find appealing such as free\nNetflix coupon codes, Google AdWords coupon codes, and voting for the best football\n(soccer) team or player. Initially available in Google Play and third-party stores, the\napplication tricked users into downloading and trusting the application with high-quality\ndesigns and social engineering. After installation, the malicious application displays pages\nthat engage the user and asks for a response from them, such as the ones shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figures 1-6: The screens displayed upon installation and launch of the FlyTrap_**\n**_Trojans._**\n\nThe engagement continues until the user is shown the Facebook login page and asks to log\nin to their account to cast their vote or collect the coupon code or credits. All this is just\nanother trick to mislead the user since no actual voting or coupon code gets generated.\nInstead, the final screen tries to justify the fake coupon code by displaying a message\nstating that “Coupon expired after redemption and before spending.” The following images\nshow one of the applications’ UI navigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7-12: The graphical flow of the FlyTrap Trojans finally leading to the login_**\n**_page_**\n\nContrary to popular belief that a phishing page is always at the forefront for compromising\nor hijacking an account, there are ways to hijack sessions even by logging into the original\nand legit domain. This Trojan exploits one such technique known as JavaScript injection.\n\nUsing this technique, the application opens the legit URL inside a WebView configured with\nthe ability to inject JavaScript code and extracts all the necessary information such as\ncookies, user account details, location, and IP address by injecting malicious JS code.\n\n**_Figure 13: A code snippet containing the type of data to be exfiltrated to the C&C_**\n**_server_**\n\nThe manipulation of web resources is addressed as cross-principal manipulation (XPM) in\nthe research “An Empirical Study Of Web Resource Manipulation In Real-world Mobile\nApplications.” Successful login into Facebook by the victim initiates the data exfiltration\nprocess and can be seen in the below screenshots of the communication with the C&C\nserver.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 14,15: The exfiltrated cookie information matches the legitimate cookie_**\n\nSeveral of the Trojans have the same malicious script and therefore identifies the source of\ndata by the parameter “from_app” as seen in the screenshots below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 16-18: The exfiltrated cookie information matches the legitimate cookie_**\n\nThe Command & Control server makes use of login credentials for authorizing access to the\nharvested data. Security vulnerabilities in the C&C server expose the entire database of\nstolen session cookies to anyone on the internet, further increasing the threat to the victim’s\nsocial credibility.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 19: One of the Command & Control servers that stores hijacked sessions_**\n\n## The Victims of FlyTrap Trojan\n\nThe exposed database contains the geolocation information of several thousands of victims\nbased on which, the victimology map shown below was generated. The Zimperium zLabs\nmobile threat research team found over 10,000 victims across 144 countries to date, which\nillustrates the impact of the social engineering campaign.\n\n**_Figure 20: Thousands of the victims are spread across 144 countries_**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Zimperium vs. FlyTrap Trojan\n\nZimperium zIPS customers are protected against FlyTrap Trojan with our on-device z9\nMobile Threat Defense machine learning engine.\n\nTo ensure your Android users are protected from FlyTrap Trojan malware, we recommend a\nquick risk assessment. Any application with FlyTrap will be flagged as a Suspicious App\nThreat inside zConsole. Admins can also review which apps are sideloaded onto the device\nthat could be increasing the attack surface and leaving data and users at risk.\n\n## Summary of FlyTrap\n\nMalicious threat actors are leveraging common user misconceptions that logging into the\nright domain is always secure irrespective of the application used to log in. The targeted\ndomains are popular social media platforms and this campaign has been exceptionally\neffective in harvesting social media session data of users from 144 countries. These\naccounts can be used as a botnet for different purposes: from boosting the popularity of\npages/sites/products to spreading misinformation or political propaganda.\n\nJust like any user manipulation, the high-quality graphics and official-looking login screens\nare common tactics to have users take action that could reveal sensitive information. In this\ncase, while the user is logging into their official account, the FlyTrap Trojan is hijacking the\nsession information for malicious intent.\n\nFlyTrap is just one example of the ongoing, active threats against mobile devices aimed at\nstealing credentials. Mobile endpoints are often treasure troves of unprotected login\ninformation to social media accounts, banking applications, enterprise tools, and more. The\ntools and techniques used by FlyTrap are not novel but are effective due to the lack of\nadvanced mobile endpoint security on these devices. It would not take much for a malicious\nparty to take FlyTrap or any other Trojan and modify it to target even more critical\ninformation.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### FlyTrap Trojan Android applications:\n\n_com.luxcarad.cardid : GG Voucher_\n_com.gardenguides.plantingfree : Vote European Football_\n_com.free_coupon.gg_free_coupon : GG Coupon Ads_\n_com.m_application.app_moi_6 : GG Voucher Ads_\n_com.free.voucher : GG Voucher_\n_com.ynsuper.chatfuel : Chatfuel_\n_Com.free_coupon.net_coupo  n : Net Coupon_\n_com.movie.net coupon : Net Coupon_\n\n\n-----\n\n_com.euro2021 : EURO 2021 Official_\n\n_00833ff71a1709e60cb04acbcc7ceecd56323e693de3c424fb37205204d43105_\n_fa08c2ca7d8614be2b0b58095d0f3115464e9139bf5051c4f3da15963bb31062_\n_30a3ad09199660baca6410a4ada290887390d9453d95eb1e84bdd984c89ecc3a_\n_8e6c98b247a2bb34d5004c3f14d2cbf2a22c987f960e86c760d44766f9361c59_\n_21b85beb9992fccb268fcef2904c5e6591a3c80b7fa8dd201e28782887fea2cb_\n_d1cf14ccbc8f718111e59f9173475b2882dc6d1ca381ff3b726f2b471711aa7e_\n_c4eed338a3449c57eb919eac9a41b5b5ca4d0223fda341005e68f5b673d745ad_\n_3b0137302a6b93cc4dd4d0a58749fc959f8d9ad26d022d6b10dc3d7608af3279_\n_3cd5cee4326d48c0b1f0c40d3b8f3e0d7ef7ef2b782afbe95e07a3d519ba5aee_\n_1a3b448853479bf6b23d283bd44b0458132c3cda1648eac631dfdc178aee5ac0_\n_5d671f5ed5e5855dc5727412b2a9293f42b7b5f31c3b924a30beacd8304863b6_\n_64f4f085050294d064860d0c9e323bbf21cb4f66773944646a9eaf4eab49e115_\n_8e2aa1a1a144f84511aafd76c83a23e33c3c107c914bb67761df32f6b68b6cf5_\n_96b235bc715d6089a163ca212d1e752c26918b3d3b1acec5bdebbdd1b40c4b85_\n_f8845f98ca1233b6db2ef44913a115f3093308846ba805aaaf21753d97e4219c_\n\n### Command and Control Servers:\n\n_hxxp://47.57.237.26_\n_hxxp://165.232.173.244:3023_\n_hxxps://manage-ads.com_\n_hxxp://quanlysanpham.work_\n\n**About Zimperium**\n\nZimperium, the global leader in mobile security, offers the only real-time, on-device,\nmachine learning-based protection against Android, iOS, and Chromebook threats.\nPowered by z9, Zimperium provides protection against the device, network, phishing, and\nmalicious app attacks.
