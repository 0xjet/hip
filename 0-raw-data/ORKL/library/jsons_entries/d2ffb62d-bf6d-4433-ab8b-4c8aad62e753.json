US authorities arrested Yu on Monday,\nAugust 21, at the Los Angeles airport, as the suspect entered the US to attend a security\nconference.\n\n## Yu alleged criminal past tied to Sakula trojan\n\n[According to an official indictment, authorities accused Yu and two other unnamed co-](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3963927-Yu-Pingan.html)\n[conspirators of infecting four US companies with Sakula, a backdoor trojan.](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-black-vine-cyberespionage-group.pdf)\n\nThe US Department of Justice described Yu as a \"malware broker\" and charged him with\nthe tool's distribution and four hacking charges. US authorities did not accuse Yu of creating\nSakula, nor hacking OPM or Anthem.\n\n\n-----\n\nBetween 2014 and 2015, hackers stole the personal records of over 21 million government\n[employees from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and over 80 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach)\n[medical records from Anthem Inc., a US company that provides health insurance, including](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach)\nfor several government agencies.\n\n## Yu accused of using three zero-days, knowing of a fourth\n\nUS cyber-security firms have accused Chinese state hackers of carrying out the OPM and\nAnthem breaches. They blamed a cyber-espionage unit named Deep Panda — also known\nas APT19.\n\nUS authorities did not elaborate on Yu's connection to Deep Panda. Nonetheless, the\nindictment mentioned that Yu and his co-conspirators were in the possession of at least four\n[zero-days — CVE-2014-0322 (affecting IE10),](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0322) [CVE-2012-4969 (affecting IE6),](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2012-4969) CVE-20124792 (affecting IE6), and an unidentified Flash Player zero-day that Yu mentioned in chat\ntranscripts.\n\nThe hacks for which Yu stands accused all took place before the OPM and Anthem\nbreaches. Historically, security firms have observed the Sakula trojan used in nation-state\ncyber-espionage campaigns exclusively.\n\nYu will be arraigned in court next week.\n\nOn a side note, the video below gives a basic introduction into nation-state cyber-espionage\ncampaigns. At 27:55, security expert The Grugq provides a very simple explanation of why\nChinese hackers targeted OPM and Anthem. The rest of the video also explains how the\nChinese cyber apparatus works, along with similar infrastructures in Russia and the US.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wP2J9aYM6Oo\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Chinese ‘Space Pirates’ are hacking Russian aerospace firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-space-pirates-are-hacking-russian-aerospace-firms/)\n\n[Google: Chinese state hackers keep targeting Russian govt agencies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chinese-state-hackers-keep-targeting-russian-govt-agencies/)\n\n[Cyberspies use IP cameras to deploy backdoors, steal Exchange emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberspies-use-ip-cameras-to-deploy-backdoors-steal-exchange-emails/)\n\n[US and allies warn of Russian hacking threat to critical infrastructure](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-and-allies-warn-of-russian-hacking-threat-to-critical-infrastructure/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[Arrest](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/arrest/)\n[China](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/china/)\n[Cyber-espionage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Data Breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-breach/)\n[Hack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hack/)\n[USA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/usa/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
