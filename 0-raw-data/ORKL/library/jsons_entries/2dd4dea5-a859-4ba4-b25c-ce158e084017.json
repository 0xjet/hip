    "plain_text": "# Business as usual: Criminal Activities in Times of a Global Pandemic\n\n**[gdatasoftware.com/blog/global-pandemic-remcos-tesla-netwire](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/global-pandemic-remcos-tesla-netwire)**\n\n11/18/2020\n\nG DATA Blog\nThe beginning of 2020 has been appalling for most parts of the world being affected by\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This brought about a change in the everyday life of\nevery individual in every country striving to sustain their daily tasks while simultaneously\npreventing further infection. Given this situation, businesses and schools have opted to\ntransition to a ‘virtual setting’ wherein a job can be done remotely and school discussion as\nwell as office meetings can be held via conference calls using applications like Zoom, Skype\nor Microsoft Teams. There has been a surge in demand for platforms for video and audio\nconferencing, chat and webinar solutions.\n\n2018 FIFA World Cup Spam Email Sample\n\n\n-----\n\nThis upheaval created opportunities for cybercriminals, as they exploit these situations in\nexecuting their malicious intents. This is not the first time that cybercriminals have taken\nadvantage of the current and significant events to lure more victims, as there were instances\nfrom the past years that shows how they utilize these happenings to spread malware. An\nexample of which was the 2018 FIFA World Cup wherein cybercriminals created a fake FIFA\npartner website to gain access to victim’s bank accounts and drop a malicious file into the\nvictim’s machine.\n\n## COVID-19 Related Phishing Emails\n\nCopy of a legitimate infection heatmap, used by\n\ncybercriminals in their fake websites (July,2020)\nWith the rise in numbers of people infected by COVID-19 all over the world, cybercriminals\nwork their way to increase the number of spam emails and phishing links related to COVID19 proliferating in the cyberworld as well. They even made their cyberattacks more diverse in\na way that they not only send spam emails with malicious attachments, but also created fake\nwebsites with fake COVID-19 related contents for victims to freely access like coronavirusmap[.]com(website is already unreachable at the time of writing). Some of these fake\nwebsites contain fake information regarding the current world statistics of COVID-19 cases.\nThese fake websites often contain malicious cryptomining related contents known as\ncryptojacking which can harm the user’s system by utilizing the system’s resources to earn\ndigital money such as Bitcoin for the malicious actor’s gain without the user’s consent.\n\nWhile some cybercriminals choose to explore new ways with their approach in pursuing their\ncybercrimes, some opt to carry on with the old ways like spam emails but with improved\ncontents to make their attacks more successful.\n\nLike the spam emails from 2018 FIFA World Cup, cybercriminals use and abuse COVID-19\nas the subject for the spam emails that they were sending out. It is noticeable on the\nfollowing two sample emails below with different contents and language used. It is one of\nthe innovations that cybercriminals do to make their spam emails more tailored to their\ntargets which increases the chance of a successful attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first email is geared towards English-speaking individuals while the second email is\naimed in targeting anyone who can understand Italian. At first look, it may seem that these\ntwo emails are different considering the language used, the subjects of the email, and the\ncontent of its message. But we can notice that both emails contain an attachment - List.arj\n_(24 KB) and Newsletter della COVID-19 Organizzazione mondialle della sanita.zip(36 KB)._\n\nExample of a COVID19-related email campaign in\n\nEnglish\n\nExample of a COVID19-related email campaign in\n\nItalian\n\n### File attachments\n\nEmail Attachment – RAR Archive\n\nThe attachment to the first email is said to be a list of the victims of COVID-19. However,\nupon analyzing the file, it can be easily identified as an archive that contains an executable\nfile – LIST.exe. This is a red flag already as a file that claims to be a text file, is an archive\nthat contains an executable file. The attachment from the second email looks like a usual\narchive, but also contains an executable file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther analysis shows that the malicious executable files from the extracted archives are\nfiles associated with a well-known malware family called GuLoader, that has been existing\nsince way before COVID19. GuLoader is a known malware that downloads its payload from\ncloud services such as Google Drive and Microsoft Drives. It is then used to download a\nremote access trojan (RAT), a malicious program that includes a backdoor for administrative\ncontrol over the target computer. In this case, considering that the files we analyzed came\nfrom two different emails with two distinct targets, the attachment files were identical, which\nboth end up downloading a Parallax RAT.\n\nFurther analysis shows that the malicious executable files from the extracted archives are\nfiles associated with a well-known malware family that has been existing since way before\nCOVID19: GuLoader is a known malware that downloads its payload from cloud services\nsuch as Google Drive and Microsoft Drives. It is then used to download a remote access\ntrojan (RAT), a malicious program that includes a backdoor for administrative control over the\ntarget computer. In this case, considering that the files we analyzed came from two different\nemails with two distinct targets, the attachment files were identical, which both end up\ndownloading a Parallax RAT.\n\nControl Backend of the Parallax RAT\n\nParallax RAT is being considered as the “new RAT on the block” which had its first\nappearance in December 2019. It is a type of RAT that can work across all versions of\nWindows OS, capable of bypassing detections, stealing credentials, and executing remote\ncommands like grabbing keystrokes and screenshots. This is a new RAT being offered as a\nMaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) and it has become a favorite amongst malware criminals as it\nis being sold in the black market for as low as $65 with a promise of 99% reliability for the\nservice it provides.\n\n\n-----\n\nTelemetry Statistics of RATs utilizing Covid-19 related\n\nnews to propagate\nWhile checking our telemetry statistics for the past 6 months with 58,524 malware samples,\naside from Parallax, there are several other malware families that leverages COVID-19\nrelated news to entice a large number of potential victims to open attachments from unknown\nsource. These malware families, most of which are RATs like Remcos, Nanocore, Netwire,\nAgent Tesla and other trojans, ranging from least destructive to most destructive, are\nunceasingly being distributed through various means like spam emails or as a downloadable\nfile from deceitful websites.\n\n## Typical malware during the pandemic\n\nDuring the time of a global health crisis, RATs are the most commonly used tools found in\nmalicious emails. Those RATs follow a distict pattern. We have taken a closer look at some\nof the proponents.\n\nGeneral Propagation Routine of RAT\n\n### Remcos\n\n\n-----\n\nThe GUI of the Remcos RAT\n\nRemcos was first seen in the wild at the 2nd half of 2016 being promoted as a\ncommercialized RAT at the price of $58 to $389. It was first used in spear phishing\ncampaigns targeting Turkish organizations. Currently, it is being sold by a German company\ncalled ‘Breaking Security’[2] and their website advertised it as a legitimate powerful remote\ncontrol and surveillance software that can be used to access computers anywhere around\nthe world.\n\n\nThe current trend for Remcos malware campaigns involved malware authors leveraging new\nand trending news worldwide for its phishing emails. Those mails usually have a pdf\nattachment. Once opened, this PDF contains a Remcos RAT dropper which runs a VB Script\nwhich in turn will execute the malware. To ensure persistence, a startup key is added to the\nregistry.\n\n**Aliases:**\n\nRemcosRAT\nRemvio\n\n**Other reference lines used in previous campaigns:**\n\n\"Re: nCoV: Coronavirus outbreak and safety measures in your city (Urgent)\".\nSmall Business Grant/Testing Centre Vouchers\nSBA Grant/Testing Centre Vouchers\nSBA Payroll Protection Program Status\n\n### AGENT TESLA\n\n\n-----\n\nAgent Tesla Monitoring GUI\n\nAgentTesla was first seen in 2014 and during the pandemic has been used in attacks that\ntarget energy companies. This may have been one of the effects of the pandemic where\nthere is a low demand for oil. Before the pandemic, Agent Tesla the preferred toold for\nattacks against the oil industry.. Since Agent Tesla is also a commercial malware that can be\nbought on the Dark Web, it has a feature that allows you to monitor or customize the payload\nand monitor its targeted victims.\n\nAgentTesla has been modified to be an advanced RAT that can also function as a keylogger\nand information stealer that can steal the victim’s Microsoft outlook credentials and other\nsaved passwords in web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Mozilla\nFirefox.\n\nWhat sets AgentTesla apart from other RATs is its added feature of stealing Wifi profiles.\nMalware actors uses this functionality in using WiFi as a mechanism to spread infection\nacross different endpoints as well as using it as a gateway for future attacks on the victim’s\nmachine\n\n**Aliases:**\n\nAgenTesla\nAgentTesla\n\n**Other Email Subjects Used by AgentTesla RAT when sending Phishing Emails:**\n\nURGENT INFORMATION LETTER: FIRST HUMAN COVID-19 VACCINE\nTEST/RESULT\nUPDATE Covid19″ Latest Tips to stay Immune to Virus!!\n“World Health Organization/Let’s fight Corona Virus together”\n\"Attention: List of Companies Affected With Coronavirus March 02, 2020\".\n\n### NANOCORE\n\n\n-----\n\nNanocore RAT GUI\n\nNanocore was first seen in the wild in 2013. Its author Thoms Huddleston aka AeonHacks,\nadmitted to developing and marketing NanoCore on the DarkWeb betweeen 2012 to 2016.\nHe was arrested, but this does not stop the spread of his creation. It was kept alive and was\nupdated since then. The new version of NanoCore was being sold on unterground markets\nfor as low as $25. Some features included remote surveillance, reverse proxy connection,\nplugins and even customer support.\n\nNetwire RAT Source Code\n\nNanocore is a sophisticated RAT that enables the attackers to gain access to details of\nvictim’s machine such as hostname and operating system. This in turn will let the cyber\ncriminals carry out more malicious activities in the victim’s machine like hijacking the web\ncamera and microphone, steal confidential information and more.\n\nWhat sets this RAT apart from other RATs is how difficult it is to detect. Unlike other RAT\ndesigned to run in a specific way, most of its behavior were similar with that of legitimate\napplications. Nanocore allows malware actors to just do anything they want to, once they\ngain access to a victim machine\n\n### Netwire\n\nScreenshot of the cybercriminal’s message to the\n\nvictim\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NetWire RAT is a malicious tool that emerged in the wild during the first half of 2012.\nNetwire became famous as a RAT hidden in an IMG file (a file extension used by disk\nimaging software). Since then it has undergone various modifications that makes it remain\nstealthy as the years passes by. Like other RATs, NetWire RAT is offered commercially and\ncan be easily purchased on Dark Web markets, which makes it accessible to malware\n[authors.

Wipers are malicious programs that\ncause data destruction on its victim machine. Unlike other malware whose aim is to achieve\nsome sort of financial gain, wipers’ main motivation is to destroy all its targeted files/directory\non a system or to replace the content of its target with a malicious content. As wipers\nevolved, malware authors decided to tweak the functionality of wipers and make these kinds\nof malwares to rewrite into master boot records (MBR).\n\nCurrently, a “Coronavirus.exe”[3] is spreading amongst Windows users. This malware’s name\nis very much connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. At first, this malware will drop several\nhidden helper files and batch files in a temporary folder in the computer system. Then, while\nstill remaining unnoticed, it will disable Windows Task Manager and User Access Control and\nplace itself inside the Startup registry. Lastly, upon reboot of the victim’s machine, a pop-up\nmessage box that tells victims to “not wast [sic] your time” because “you can’t terminate this\nprocess!” will be executed and won’t be terminated because the task manager was disabled.\nMeanwhile, the original MBR is being overwritten with a new malicious code.\n\n\nAnother variant of this MBR-modifying malware was discovered by one of our analysts[4]\nwhich at first may seem to be a simple screenlocker, but unknown to the user, is also a\nmalware infecting the MBR.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis type of malware may not be as destructive as the previous malwares we have cited, but\nthis can mislead the user into thinking that something is wrong with their system. One\nCOVID-19 themed jokeware will prompt a message box that says “CoronaVirus has stopped\nworking” when executed. This is very likely to cause alarm in many users and lead them into\nthinking that something is wrong with their computers, when in reality, all is well and the\nsystem was never in any danger to begin with. Jokewares may be the least of our worries\ninvolving COVID-19 malwares circulating the cyber world right now, but it is better to be safe\nthan to be sorry. It may be mildly annoying to some, but has the potential to launch an\norganization into full “damage control mode” and cause some level of disruption.\n\nLooking at the mode of delivery for malware,, there is one thing that stick out:\n\nEven though malware authors take advantage of the current events around the world, most\nmalicious files they commonly attach to spam emails are part of long-established and wellknown malware families which have a high infection rate and enjoy broad support and a\nlarge user base within the underground community.\n\n**Aliases:**\n\nNetWeird\nNetWire\nRecam\n\n**Other Email Subjects Used by Netwire RAT when sending Phishing Emails:**\n\nMalspam claiming to be from Dr Stella Chungong at the WHO\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nJust like in the real world, with proper hand washing, using mask and social distancing, we\ncan prevent becoming a victim of these kind of attacks in cyberworld, through practicing and\nsharing appropriate cyber-hygiene too such as:\n\n1. Avoid opening emails, downloading attached files, and clicking on links from unsolicited\n\nsender.\n2. Disabling macro editing in your Microsoft office setting. You may refer to the\n\ninstructions [here.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/enable-or-disable-macros-in-office-files-12b036fd-d140-4e74-b45e-16fed1a7e5c6)\n3. Always have an updated AV for your protection.\n\nWhile we are still in search for a vaccine that can cure COVID-19 in the real world,\ncyberworld on the other hand has its ‘vaccine’ against these malicious files which is the\ncreation of advanced detections to identify possible threats and prevent further infection. Just\nlike G Data’s latest DeepRay Technology that uses artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning in countering sophisticated attacks from cybercriminals. This ‘vaccine’ in the\ncyberworld is what will help every individual and organizations to thrive with their work and\nstudies despite the change in their daily norms.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**GuLoader**\n\n11a834cda4a55c8adb663fbcdd4b1f1018715dd737d3089a731b9840b77e5e76:\n\nDetected as Win32.Trojan.Agent.YIZBCK\n\n**Remcos**\n\n73c07d1b17e8224996866c53ac95c9c327a1b88f78bef72852ca250016d06c33:\n\nDetected as Trojan.GenericKD.30581682\n\nDeepRay detection: RemcosRAT\n\n**Parallax**\n\n0a689281e5c807412fd9fca5f4a2d02f90e149da1ecc16179a09d88fa88eed74\n\nDetected as Win32.Packed.Kryptik.WP03OZ\n\nDeepRay detection: ParallaxRAT\n\n**NanoCore**\n\n2add0397fccd1c5cfe522530d20e672c47e6259ea625a3338845b1383272c23e:\n\nDetected as Gen:Variant.MSIL.Lynx.52,\n\n\n-----\n\nDeepRay detection: Nanocore\n\n**Netwire**\n\ncdd2e26792bd7ee81a6297d13dd514836778620c9bd96e79ae6ee26239c546b1:\n\nDetected as Win32.Trojan.Netwire.C\n\n**AgentTesla**\n\n484aa9b06abff6b8b07695522b81fc70a8163f466b2aee2076481fab3e57840e:\n\nDetected as Trojan.GenericKD.41932285\n\nDeepRay detection: AgentTesla\n\n**Wiper/MBR-Rewriting Malware**\n\nfba31181ed1957e81c452fa1e860414d3a2bd2da470074a32f196f873a37d9ad\n\nDetected as Trojan.GenericKD.33570587\n\n**Jokeware**\n\n6b61c223d618ead7ca78f4731a0128e30bf602bdfe8d940e442041486cb2fe76\n\nDetected as Gen:Heur.Bodegun.1\n\n\n-----",
