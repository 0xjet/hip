The campaigns were limited — in each case, we assess\n[the number of targets was in the tens of users,\" the Google TAG analysts added.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/protecting-android-users-from-0-day-attacks/)\n\n\"Once clicked, the link redirected the target to an attacker-owned domain that delivered the\nexploits before redirecting the browser to a legitimate website. If the link was not active, the\nuser was redirected directly to a legitimate website.\"\n\nThis attack technique was also used against journalists and other Google users who were\nalerted that they were the target of [government-backed attacks.](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9007870)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Spyware implant dropped using Android banking trojan\n\n[In these campaigns, the attackers first installed the Android Alien banking trojan with RAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/apk.alien)\nfunctionality used to load the Predator Android implant, allowing recording audio, adding CA\ncertificates, and hiding apps.\n\nThis report is a follow-up to a July 2021 analysis of four other 0-day flaws discovered in 2021\nin Chrome, Internet Explorer, and WebKit (Safari).\n\nAs Google TAG researchers revealed, Russian-backed government hackers linked to the\nRussian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) exploited the Safari zero-day to target iOS\ndevices belonging to government officials from western European countries.\n\n\"TAG is actively tracking more than 30 vendors with varying levels of sophistication and\npublic exposure selling exploits or surveillance capabilities to government-backed actors,\"\nGoogle TAG added on Thursday.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Mozilla fixes Firefox, Thunderbird zero-days exploited at Pwn2Own](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mozilla-fixes-firefox-thunderbird-zero-days-exploited-at-pwn2own/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Google: Chinese state hackers keep targeting Russian govt agencies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chinese-state-hackers-keep-targeting-russian-govt-agencies/)\n\n[Google gives 50% bonus to Android 13 Beta bug bounty hunters](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-gives-50-percent-bonus-to-android-13-beta-bug-bounty-hunters/)\n\n[Google Play Store now forces apps to disclose what data is collected](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-play-store-now-forces-apps-to-disclose-what-data-is-collected/)\n\n[Google Chrome emergency update fixes zero-day used in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-emergency-update-fixes-zero-day-used-in-attacks/)\n\n\n-----",
