APT\ngroups may potentially try to mask the identity of their government sponsor by posing as an independent\nhacktivist group when targeting a victim company.\n\n- Enterprise-like cybercriminals seeking personal profit through targeting the gaming industry and stealing\n\naccount credentials, activation codes, in-game valuables, and personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nCASE STUDY: APT28 SUSPECTED IN FALSE FLAG OPERATION ON FRENCH MEDIA COMPANY\n\nIn April 2015, threat actors compromised TV5 Monde, a French news station with a global audience. The actors\ndamaged equipment, disrupting broadcasts for several hours, and defaced the company’s website and social\nmedia accounts with propaganda pertaining to ISIS and the CyberCaliphate, a hacktivist group allegedly\nassociated with ISIS. However, although the activity initially appeared to be the work of the CyberCaliphate,\n\n1 Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors are assessed to take direction from a nation state to steal information or\nconduct network attacks, tenaciously pursue their objectives, and are capable of using a range of tools and tactics.\n\n\n**WE HAVE OBSERVED AT LEAST 17**\n**ADVANCED THREAT GROUPS COMPROMISE**\n**COMPANIES IN THESE SUBSECTORS:**\n\n- Entertainment & Games Software\n\n- Diversified Entertainment\n\n- Information Collection & Delivery\n\n- Internet Publishing, Broadcasting & Search Portals\n\n- Magazine Publishers\n\n- Multimedia, Graphics & Publishing Software\n\n- Newspaper Publishers\n\n- Television Station Groups\n\n\n-----\n\n# TOP 5\n#### MALWARE FAMILIES\n\n**59% ChinaChopper**\n**15%** SOGU (aka Kaba)\n**10%** Gh0stRAT\n**8%** PoisonIvy\n**8%** Page\n\nFireEye Threat Intelligence suspects that APT28, a group associated with the Russian government, was instead responsible\nfor the activity. APT28 likely posed as the CyberCaliphate to capitalize on Western fears over Islamic extremism, particularly\nfollowing the Charlie Hebdo-inspired attacks of several months prior. The compromise of TV5 Monde was likely a Russian\ninformation operation intended to alarm the French, with whom Russia’s relations have been declining (as with the rest of\nthe West), and draw the West’s attention away from Russia’s ongoing role in the Ukraine crisis and towards the threat of\nterrorism in the Middle East.\n\nTHREAT HORIZON & INDUSTRY OUTLOOK\n\n\n# TOP 5\n#### CRIMEWARE FAMILIES\n\n**35% Upatre**\n**32% Delf**\n**15% ZeroAccess (aka SIREFEF)**\n**10% Allaple**\n**8% Muxif**\n\n\nThe entertainment and media industries play a key role in shaping public opinion and even national image, making it a\nvaluable target for APT groups and hacktivists seeking influence. The following factors may further influence threat activity\ntowards these sectors:\n\n- Concerns over domestic stability and government legitimacy will likely result in increased targeting from APT groups\n\nseeking to assist their associated government in monitoring public opinion, shaping its image, promoting its message, and\notherwise leveraging its soft power to maintain and spread its influence.\n\n- A desire to discourage publication of controversial stories and views may prompt some threat actors to attempt to gain\n\naccess to a relevant media organization’s raw reporting and acquire information on the identities of its sources. Statesponsored threat actors aiming to suppress a certain story, for example, may target a media organization reporting on the\ntopic in an effort to evaluate what the organization knows about the issue, and identify its sources.\n\n- Efforts to intimidate or punish a media organization for publishing a critical or unflattering story might prompt the threat\n\nactors to retaliate by targeting the offending media organization. Threat actors may steal data on employees and sources\n\n\n\n- Negotiations Information\n\n- Network Infrastructure Documents\n\n- PR and Marketing Materials\n\n- Reporters’ Communications\n\n- User Credentials\n\n\n-----\n\nactors may try to steal and then publicly release sensitive data, in an attempt to\nembarrass the targeted organization and damage its credibility.\n\n- Tensions or conflicts between adversaries, whether state or non-state, will\n\nprobably lead to increased threat activity from associated threat actors\naiming to prevent their adversary from spreading its own message or\npropaganda, while potentially seeking to spread its own propaganda through\nits opponents’ channels.\n\n**ChinaChopper**\n\n### TOP .NET code within HTTP POST commands.\n\n**SOGU**\n\n### MALWARE\n FAMILIES\n\nFireEye most frequently **GH0STRAT**\n\ndetected threat actors command shell, wipe event logs, and create, manipulate, delete, launch, and transfer files.\n\nusing the following\n\n**POISONIVY**\n\ntargeted malware families\n\nto compromise\norganizations in the\n\nentertainment and **Page**\n\nmedia sectors:\n\n### TOP Upatre CRIMEWARE\n\n**Delf**\n\n### FAMILIES without the consent or knowledge of the user and may also have the ability to steal sensitive information.\n\nFireEye’s sinkhole and\ndynamically shared threat **ZeroAccess**\n\ndata indicate that the perform click fraud.\n\nfollowing crimeware\n\n**Allaple**\n\nvariants were the most\n\ncommonly detected in\nthe entertainment and **Muxif**\n\nmedia sectors: the registry to maintain persistence.\n\n**FireEye, Inc.**\n1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 / 408.321.6300 / 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) / info@FireEye.com\n\n**Fi** **E**\n\n\ntargeting of providers and platforms by APT groups, cybercriminals,\nand hacktivists aiming to facilitate further targeting through social\nengineering, and/or promote their own views through disrupting services\nor defacing webpages.\n\n|TOP MALWARE FAMILIES FireEye most frequently detected threat actors using the following targeted malware families to compromise organizations in the entertainment and media sectors:|ChinaChopper SOGU GH0STRAT POISONIVY Page|is a small webshell that provides threat actors unauthorized access to an information system using a simple password for authentication and is capable of executing Microsoft .NET code within HTTP POST commands. (aka Kaba, PlugX), a backdoor that is capable of file upload and download, arbitrary process execution, filesystem and registry access, service configuration access, remote shell access, and implementing a custom VNC/RDP-like protocol to provide the command and control (C2) server with graphical access to the desktop. is a remote access tool (RAT) derived from publicly available source code. It can perform screen and audio captures, enable a webcam, list and kill processes, open a command shell, wipe event logs, and create, manipulate, delete, launch, and transfer files. is a publicly available RAT that provides comprehensive remote access capabilities on a compromised system. Its variants are configured, built, and controlled using a graphical Poison Ivy management interface available online. It can be configured to produce shellcode, which can be packaged into an executable or combined with an existing executable to hide its presence. It is typically configured to inject multiple shellcode stubs into the explorer.exe process. (aka ELISE) is a downloader that attempts to retrieve encoded DLLs from a pre-configured command and control server, which it communicates with using HTTP requests. Once the DLLs are downloaded, the downloader loads them into memory. It also incorporates several source-level anti-reverse engineering functions.|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|TOP CRIMEWARE FAMILIES FireEye’s sinkhole and dynamically shared threat data indicate that the following crimeware variants were the most commonly detected in the entertainment and media sectors:|Upatre Delf ZeroAccess Allaple Muxif|is a Trojan downloader that often arrives via a spam email, drive-by download or exploit,. Upatre will download one or more additional types of malware onto an infected system and has been observed distributing a wide variety of malware including, but not limited to, Zbot, Dyre, Rovnix, CryptoLocker, and Necurs. is a family of Trojans whose files are often compiled in Delphi. It has the ability to connect to remote server for downloading and installing additional malware onto the system without the consent or knowledge of the user and may also have the ability to steal sensitive information. (aka SIREFEF) is a Trojan with advanced rootkit capabilities. Initially developed as a delivery mechanism for other types of malicious software, it has been re-architected to perform click fraud. is a worm that will perform denial of service attacks on specific targets and attempt to propagate to other systems on the same network. is a Trojan downloader that communicates with a C2 server to send system information, receive instructions, and download additional malicious executables. It also modifies the registry to maintain persistence.|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----",
