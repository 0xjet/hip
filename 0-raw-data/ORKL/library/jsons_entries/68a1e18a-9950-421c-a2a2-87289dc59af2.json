Malware authors are not much different and need to adapt to survive\n[in changing technological landscapes and marketplaces. In a previous blog, we highlighted](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=6396eabd-005b-4589-8099-f12ad60e5ade&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n[a free Android remote administration tool (RAT) known as AndroRAT (Android.Dandro)](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-012916-2128-99)\nand what was believed to be the first ever malware APK binder. Since then, we have seen\nimitations and evolutions of such threats in the threat landscape. One such threat that is\n[making waves in underground forums is called Dendroid (Android.Dendoroid), which is](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-030418-2633-99)\nalso a word meaning something is tree-like or has a branching structure.\n\n**_Figure 1. Dendroid advertisement banner_**\n\n\n-----\n\nDendroid is a HTTP RAT that is marketed as being transparent to the user and firmware\ninterface, having a sophisticated PHP panel, and an application APK binder package. The\nAPK binder used by Dendroid just so happens to share some links to the author of the\noriginal AndroRAT APK binder.\n\n**_Figure 2. Dendroid control panel_**\n\nAccording to postings on underground forums, the official seller of Dendroid is known as\n“Soccer.” The seller markets Dendroid as offering many features that have never been\nseen before and comes with 24/7 support, all for a once off payment of $300 to be paid\nthrough BTC, LTC, BTC-e, or other services. Some of the many features on offer include\nthe following:\n\nDelete call logs\nCall a phone number\nOpen Web pages\nRecord calls and audio\nIntercept text messages\nTake and upload photos and videos\nOpen an application\nInitiate a HTTP flood (DoS) for a period of time\nChange the command-and-control (C&C) server\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3. Dendroid APK binder_**\n\nAs previously mentioned, according to reports on underground forums, the author of the\nDendroid APK binder included with this package had assistance writing this APK binder\nfrom the author of the original AndroRAT APK binder.\n\nThe evolution of remote access tools on the Android platform was inevitable. The creation\nof Dendroid and the positive feedback on underground forums for this type of threat shows\nthat there is a strong cybercriminal marketplace for such tools. On the PC platform, other\n[crimeware toolkits like Zeus (Trojan.Zbot) and SpyEye (Trojan.Spyeye) started off in a](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-011016-3514-99)\nsimilar manner and grew quickly in popularity due to their ease of use and notoriety\nstemming from the high profile crimes perpetrated as a result of their usage. While this\nmay be early days for Dendroid, Symantec will be keeping a close eye on this threat.\n\nTo stay protected, Symantec recommends installing a security app, such as Norton Mobile\nSecurity, which detects this threat as [Android.Dendoroid.
