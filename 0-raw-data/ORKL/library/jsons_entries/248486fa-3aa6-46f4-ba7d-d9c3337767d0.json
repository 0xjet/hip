The US National Security Agency\n(NSA), the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the US\nCyber National Mission Force (CNMF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\nAustralian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC),\nthe Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) and the New Zealand National\nCyber Security Centre (NCSC) agree with this attribution and the details\nprovided in this advisory.\n\nThis advisory provides an overview of TTPs deployed by the actor to gain initial\naccess into the cloud environment and includes advice to detect and mitigate\nthis activity.\n\n#### Previous actor activity\n\nThe NCSC has previously detailed how Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)\ncyber actors have targeted governmental, think tank, healthcare and energy\ntargets for intelligence gain. It has now observed SVR actors expanding their\ntargeting to include aviation, education, law enforcement, local and state\ncouncils, government financial departments and military organisations.\n\nSVR actors are also known for:\n\n  - [the supply chain compromise of SolarWinds software](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-us-call-out-russia-for-solarwinds-compromise)\n\n\n-----\n\n  - [activity that targeted organisations developing the COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development-V1-1.pdf)\n\n##### Evolving TTPs\n\nAs organisations continue to modernise their systems and move to cloud-based\ninfrastructure, the SVR has adapted to these changes in the operating\nenvironment.\n\nThey have to move beyond their traditional means of initial access, such as\nexploiting software vulnerabilities in an on-premise network, and instead target\nthe cloud services themselves.\n\nTo access the majority of the victims’ cloud hosted network, actors must first\nsuccessfully authenticate to the cloud provider. Denying initial access to the\ncloud environment can prohibit SVR from successfully compromising their target.\nIn contrast, in an on-premise system, more of the network is typically exposed to\nthreat actors.\n\nBelow describes in more detail how SVR actors are adapting to continue their\n\ncyber operations for intelligence gain. These TTPs have been observed in the last\n\n12 months.\n\n#### Access via service and dormant accounts \n\nPrevious SVR campaigns reveal the actors have successfully used brute forcing\n[(T1110) and password spraying to access service accounts. This type of account is](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/)\ntypically used to run and manage applications and services. There is no human\nuser behind them so they cannot be easily protected with multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA), making these accounts more susceptible to a successful\ncompromise. Service accounts are often also highly privileged depending on\nwhich applications and services they’re responsible for managing. Gaining\naccess to these accounts provides threat actors with privileged initial access to\na network, to launch further operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nSVR campaigns have also targeted dormant accounts belonging to users who no\nlonger work at a victim organisation but whose accounts remain on the system.\n[(T1078.004).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004/)\n\nFollowing an enforced password reset for all users during an incident, SVR actors\nhave also been observed logging into inactive accounts and following\ninstructions to reset the password. This has allowed the actor to regain access\nfollowing incident response eviction activities.\n\n#### Cloud-based token authentication\n\nAccount access is typically authenticated by either username and password\ncredentials or system-issued access tokens. The NCSC and partners have\nobserved SVR actors using tokens to access their victims’ accounts, without\n[needing a password (T1528).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528/)\n\nThe default validity time of system-issued tokens varies dependant on the\nsystem, however cloud platforms should allow administrators to adjust the\nvalidity time as appropriate for their users. More information can be found on this\nin the mitigations section of this advisory.\n\n#### Enrolling new devices to the cloud\n\nOn multiple occasions, the SVR has successfully bypassed password\n\nauthentication on personal accounts using password spraying and credential\n\nreuse. SVR actors have also then bypassed MFA through a technique known as\n\n‘MFA bombing’ or ‘MFA fatigue’, in which the actors repeatedly push MFA requests\n\n[to a victim’s device until the victim accepts the notification (T1621).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621/)\n\nOnce an actor has bypassed these systems to gain access to the cloud\n\nenvironment, SVR actors have been observed registering their own device as a\n\n[new device on the cloud tenant (T1098.005). If device validation rules are not set](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/005/)\n\nup, SVR actors can successfully register their own device and gain access to the\n\nnetwork.\n\nBy configuring the network with device enrolment policies, there have been\n\ninstances where these measures have defended against SVR actors and denied\n\nthem access to the cloud tenant.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Residential proxies\n\nAs network-level defences improve detection of suspicious activity, SVR actors\nhave looked at other ways to stay covert on the internet. A TTP associated with\n[this actor is the use of residential proxies (T1090.002). Residential proxies typically](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/002/)\nmake traffic appear to originate from IP addresses within internet service\nprovider (ISP) ranges used for residential broadband customers and hide the true\nsource. This can make it harder to distinguish malicious connections from typical\n\nusers. This reduces the effectiveness of network defences that use IP addresses\nas indicators of compromise, and so it is important to consider a variety of\ninformation sources such as application and host-based logging for detecting\nsuspicious activity.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe SVR is a sophisticated actor capable of carrying out a global supply chain\n\ncompromise such as the 2020 SolarWinds, however the guidance in this advisory\n\nshows that a strong baseline of cyber security fundamentals can help defend\n\nfrom such actors.\n\nFor organisations that have moved to cloud infrastructure, a first line of defence\n\nagainst an actor such as SVR should be to protect against SVR’s TTPs for initial\n\naccess. By following the mitigations outlined in this advisory, organisations will be\n\nin a stronger position to defend against this threat.\n\nOnce the SVR gain initial access, the actor is capable of deploying highly\n[sophisticated post compromise capabilities such as MagicWeb, as reported in](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/24/magicweb-nobeliums-post-compromise-trick-to-authenticate-as-anyone/)\n2022. Therefore, mitigating against the SVR’s initial access vectors is particularly\nimportant for network defenders.\n\n[CISA have also produced guidance through their Secure Cloud Business](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/secure-cloud-business-applications-scuba-project)\n\n[Applications (SCuBA) Project](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/secure-cloud-business-applications-scuba-project) which is designed to protect assets stored in cloud\n\nenvironments.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the TTPs listed in this report, such as residential proxies and exploitation\n\nof system accounts, are similar to those reported as recently as January 2024 by\n\n[Microsoft.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/25/midnight-blizzard-guidance-for-responders-on-nation-state-attack/)\n\n#### MITRE ATT&CK®\n\nThis report has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, a\nglobally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based\n\non real-world observations.\n\n|Tactic ID Technique Procedure|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Credential Access|T1110|Brute forcing|The SVR use password spraying and brute forcing as an initial infection vector.|\n|Initial Access|T1078.0 04|Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts|The SVR use compromised credentials to gain access to accounts for cloud services, including system and dormant accounts.|\n|Credential Access|T1528|Steal Application Access Token|The SVR use stolen access tokens to login to accounts without the need for passwords.|\n|Credential Access|T1621|Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation|The SVR repeatedly push MFA requests to a victim’s device until the victim accepts the notification, providing SVR access to the account.|\n|Command and Control|T1090.0 02|Proxy: External Proxy|The SVR use open proxies in residential IP ranges to blend in with expected IP address pools in access logs.|\n|Persistence|T1098.0 05|Account Manipulation: Device Registration|The SVR attempt to register their own device on the cloud tenant after acquiring access to accounts.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mitigation and Detection\n\nA number of mitigations will be useful in defending against the activity\ndescribed in this advisory:\n\n**>** **Use multi-factor authentication (/2-factor authentication/two-step**\n\nverification) to reduce the impact of password compromises. See NCSC\n[guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services)\n[authentication-online-services](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services) and\n\n[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa)\n\n**>** Accounts that cannot use 2SV should have strong, unique passwords.\n\nUser and system accounts should be disabled when no longer required\n\nwith a ‘joiners, movers and leavers’ process in place and regular reviews\nto identify and disable inactive/dormant accounts. See NCSC guidance:\n[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps/identity-and-access-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps/identity-and-access-management)\n[management](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps/identity-and-access-management)\n\n**>** System and service accounts should implement the principle of least\n\nprivilege, providing a tightly scoped access to resources required for the\nservice to function.\n\n**>** Canary service accounts should be created which appear to be valid\n\nservice accounts but are never used by legitimate services. Monitoring\nand alerting on the use of these account provides a high confidence\nsignal that they are being used illegitimately and should be investigated\nurgently.\n\n**>** Session lifetimes should be kept as short as practical to reduce the\n\nwindow of opportunity for an adversary to use stolen session tokens. This\nshould be paired with a suitable authentication method that strikes a\nbalance between regular user authentication and user experience.\n\n**>** Ensure device enrolment policies are configured to only permit authorised\n\ndevices to enrol. Use zero-touch enrolment where possible, or if self\n\n-----\n\nenrolment is required then use a strong form of 2SV that is resistant to\nphishing and prompt bombing. Old devices should be prevented from\n(re-)enrolling when no longer required. See NCSC guidance:\n[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/getting-](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/getting-ready/provisioning-and-distributing-devices)\n[ready/provisioning-and-distributing-devices](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/getting-ready/provisioning-and-distributing-devices)\n\n**>** Consider a variety of information sources such as application events and\n\nhost-based logs to help prevent, detect and investigate potential\nmalicious behaviour. Focus on the information sources and indicators of\ncompromise that have a better rate of false positives. For example,\nlooking for changes to user agent strings that could indicate session\nhijacking may be more effective than trying to identify connections from\nsuspicious IP addresses.
