The ransomware gang has a total of 18 global victims, with the largest\nnumber of victims based in the U.S. Black Basta is known for stealing corporate data and\ndocuments before encrypting devices. They’re also known for their double extortion attacks,\nwhich shame victims into paying the demanded ransom or risk having data leaked on a leak\nsite.\n\n[Last week, Avertium published a Threat Intelligence Report discussing the state of](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-avoslocker-ransomware)\nransomware in 2022. Ransomware trends are on the rise and one of those trends is victim\nshaming – a trend that Black Basta has made used heavily. As we get ready to dive deeper\ninto the tactics and techniques of Black Basta ransomware, let’s remember that even though\nransomware is here to stay, there are ways to protect your cyber environment and keep your\norganization safe from ransomware threat actors like Black Basta.\n\n## Black Basta Ransomware\n\nActive since April 2022, Black Basta is both ransomware and a ransomware gang. The gang\nhas been observed targeting organizations in the U.S with a hyper focus on the construction\nand manufacturing industries. They’ve also been observed targeting the real estate,\n\n\n-----\n\nbusiness services, food and beverage, chemicals, insurance, healthcare, and metals and\nmining industries.\n\nTwo of the most recent and well known Black Basta attacks include their attack on the\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA), as well as their attack on Deustsche Windtechnik.\n\nThe ADA is a dentist and oral hygiene advocacy association. The organization had 2.8 GB of\ndata stolen, with 30% of that data leaked on Black Basta’s leak site. The attack disrupted\nsome of the organization’s email, phone, and chat systems. The ADA had to take their\nsystems offline and worked with third party cyber security specialists to determine the\nseverity of the attack.\n\nThe German wind farm operator, Deustsche Windtechnik was attacked in April 2022 and had\nto shut off their remote data monitoring connections to their wind turbines for about two days\nas they recovered. Despite the company not confirming if they were hit with a ransomware\nattack, researchers were able to confirm that they were due to finding the company’s name\non the leak site of Black Basta.\n\nThe attack on Deustsche Windtechnik is just one of several cyber attacks on German energy\nproviders this year. In March 2022, Nordex was forced to shut down their IT systems across\nseveral locations due to a cyber attack. Viasat also suffered from a cyber attack this year,\ncausing 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany to malfunction. It has not been confirmed if\nthe ADA or if Deustsche Windtechnik paid a ransom to Black Basta.\n\n## techniques and tactics\n\nA deep dive analysis into Black Basta ransomware reveals that the cyber criminals’\nransomware appends the extension “.basta” at the end of encrypted files. According to Cyble\nResearch Labs, Black Basta is a console-based executable ransomware that can only be\nexecuted with administrator privileges. After the ransomware executes, it deletes shadow\ncopies by using vssadmin.exe, removing the Windows backup so their victims can’t revert\nthe system to its previous state after encryption.\n\nAfter removing the backups, Black Basta drops two image files into the temp folder of the\ninfected system. Next, the ransomware changes the desktop wallpaper using the API\n**systemparamaterssinfoW() and uses a file called dlaksjdoiwq.jpg as the desktop**\nbackground wallpaper. Once Black Basta creates the registry entry, it hijacks the FAX\nservice, checking to see if the service name FAX is present in the system. Once it verifies\nthat it’s present, Black Basta deletes the original, creating a new malicious service named\nFAX.\n\nNext, the boot options are checked using GetSystemMetrics() API, while\n_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Network\\Fax is_\nadded in the registry to start the FAX service in safe mode After the ransomware reboots the\n\n\n-----\n\nsystem using the ShellExecuteA() API, FAX service launches and begins encryption.\nAccording to Cyble Research Labs, the following list of files and folders are excluded from\nencryption:\n\nBin\nWindows\nLocal Settings\nApplication Data\ntxt\nboot\ntxt\njpg\nDAT\nico\n\nUsing FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW) APIs to find files, Black Basta finds the files in\ntheir victim’s machines and encrypts them – using a multithreading approach for faster\nencryption.\n\nImage 1: Infection System in Safe Mode\n\n_Source: Cyble Research Labs_\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 2: Ransom Note by Black Basta\n\n_Source: Cyble Research Lab_\n\nResearchers believe that Black Basta hasn’t started recruiting affiliates in underground\nforums, but their previous advertisements they posted before their attacks suggest they use\nstolen credentials (purchased on the dark net) to get into organization’s systems.\n\n## connections to conti\n\nThe threat actors behind Black Basta were suspected to be a rebrand of the ransomware\n[gang, Conti. In a previous Threat Intelligence Report we explained that Conti is a Russian-](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/an-in-depth-look-at-ransomware-gang-conti)\nspeaking RaaS organization, who uses RaaS to deploy disruptive ransomware attacks that\ntarget critical infrastructure, like hospitals and government organizations. Conti generally\nfocuses on attacking companies with more than $100 million in annual revenue. They\nspecialize in double extortion operations of simultaneous data encryption and data\nexfiltration for financial gain. If the ransom is not paid, Conti will blackmail their victims by\nthreatening to publish stolen files.\n\nIn May 2021, the FBI notified the public stating that Conti tried to breach over a dozen\nhealthcare and first responder organizations. By September 2021, the gang successfully\nstole the data of several healthcare organizations. In March 2022, we published another\n[Threat Intelligence Report featuring the gang. This time, we discussed Conti’s leaked internal](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-contis-leaked-log-chats)\nchats, published on Twitter by a Ukrainian security researcher in February 2022. The leak\n[contained several years’ worth of internal chat logs linked to Conti and can be read here.](https://intelx.io/?did=51fbf19b-91f5-4d2d-b4e7-504477ebe916)\n\nBecause of the leaked chats and Conti’s leaked source code, there was speculation that\nConti’s successful ransomware operation was soon to be dismantled, but researchers found\nthat not to be the case. In fact, it appears as if Conti has simply started to rebrand and\nstrategize despite the leaked chats.\n\nWhen Black Basta hit the scene in April 2022, researchers stated that the ransomware gang\nshared similarities with Conti. For example, Black Basta’s data leak site was very similar to\nConti’s data leak site. The gangs also shared the same victim recovery portals. However,\nConti denied that they rebranded as Black Basta and called the group “kids”.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 3: Black Bata and Conti s Recovery Portals\n\n_Source: Cyble Research Lab_\n\nImage 4: Conti's Message\n\n_Source: Twitter.com/BrettCallow_\n\nDespite this declaration, researchers still held the belief that Conti rebranded as Black Basta.\nWhen Black Basta was discovered and the similarities between the two groups were pointed\nout, there was speculation that Black Basta could have been a faction of Conti that went\nrogue, and Conti was not telling the truth. When Conti’s chats were leaked, we not only\nlearned how the ransomware gang operated, but we also learned how some Conti\nemployees truly felt about attacking certain critical industries, such as healthcare.\n\nIn October of 2020, Conti’s members had plans to attack 400 hospitals in the U.S and in\nBritain. The attacks were launched during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when\nhospitals needed their computers the most. Additionally, Conti ultimately had access to over\n400 healthcare facilities (not specifically hospitals). In May 2021, Conti attacked Ireland’s\nHealth Service Executive (HSE) that operates the country’s public health system. It ended up\ndisrupting the public health system and the recovery costs were expected to exceed $600\nmillion.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attack on HSE led to questions from some Conti members because the members were\nunder the assumption that the group didn’t attack public resources like hospitals. Some of\nConti’s managers adhered to this policy, and in June 2021, a manager named “Reshaev” told\nanother user named “Pin” that he wouldn’t attack a target he infiltrated because of this policy.\n“Pin” countered “Reshaev” and said that the network belonged to a sports clinic. “Reshaev”\nreplied that they don’t touch the healthcare sector at all, therefore they would be avoiding the\nclinic.\n\nHowever, the ban wasn’t upheld across the entire Conti organization because in October\n2021, “Reshaev” asked someone named “Stern” (the most senior Conti manager) if he\napproved of a ransomware attack against a hospital by an affiliate called “Dollar”. However,\nthere was no reply, so the question was asked again.\n\n**Reshaev: “Did you give the green light to the hospital lock to Dollar?”**\n\n**Stern: “I usually don’t approve locks,” replied Stern. “Dollar” was later sent an encrypted**\nnote.\n\n“Dollar” responded with a series of numbers and sums apparently calculating a 20 percent\nshare of something. In the case above, you can see how it’s possible for a former Conti\nemployee to branch off and start their own ransomware gang due to differing opinions.\nHowever, Cyberint Research, dug a little deeper and found that a ransomware sample from\nFebruary 2022, generated a ransomware note from a group named “no_name_software”.\nThe group took responsibility for Black Basta ransomware, and the Onion page disclosed in\nthe ransom note was the same Onion page Black Basta currently operates.\n\n### CONTI REBRANDING INTO SMALLER GROUPS\n\nConti may not be associated with Black Basta, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t trying to\nrebrand at all. According to our partners, AdvIntel, Conti is currently rebranding as multiple\nransomware groups and that the brand, not the organization, is shutting down. On May 19,\n2022, Conti’s official website went offline, as well as their negotiations service site. Conti’s\ninfrastructure (chat rooms, servers, proxy hosts, etc.) went through a massive reset.\n\nThe publicity function of Conti’s blog is still active, but the operational function of “Conti\nNews” (used to upload new data to force victims to pay) is defunct – including infrastructure\nrelated to data uploads, negotiations, and the hosting of stolen data. AdvIntel believes that\nConti can no longer support and obtain extortion and that the shutdown was not\nspontaneous but calculated. May 19, 2022 is Conti’s official date of death with their attack on\nCosta Rica being their final dance.\n\nThe attack on Costa Rica, which forced the country to declare a state of emergency, was\nConti’s way of keeping the illusion that they were still active and diverting everyone’s\nattention, while working on their restructuring. During the diversion tactics, Conti’s extension\n\n\n-----\n\n[groups such as BlackByte and KaraKurt were actively and silently attacking organizations.](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/superbowl-weekend-blackbyte-coinbase-were-real-stars-of-show)\nAdditionally, infiltration specialists who were the backbone of Conti, were forming alliances\nwith [BlackCat,](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/blackcat-ransomware-triple-extortion-analysis-tactics) [AvosLocker,](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-avoslocker-ransomware) [HIVE, and](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/hive-ransomware-attacks-analysis) [HelloKitty/FiveHands.](https://www.avertium.com/blog/fivehands-ransomware-overview)\n\nThere is no evidence that suggests that Conti’s leaked chats have an impact on their recent\nactivities, but perhaps the event that provoked the leak (Conti’s support of Russia) in the first\nplace may have played a part in their demise. By engaging in political discourse, Conti\nintervened in Russian state matters, and opened themselves up for scrutiny and attacks from\n[hacktivists like Anonymous and NB65.](https://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/russia-vs-ukraine-part-two)\n\ng shorter. This happened with Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855\nand CVE-2021-27065).\n\n### Stay Vigilant\n\nAs we stated in our previous Threat Intelligence Report featuring AvosLocker ransomware,\nransomware trends are on the rise and ambitious threat actors like Black Basta are in it for\nthe long haul. Black Basta’s recent attacks prove that they are not only consistent but\npersistent. Conti even addressed them in their blog when there was speculation surrounding\na connection to the gang. This acknowledgement could be an indicator of Black Basta’s\ntalent, as well as their gaining popularity. It’s important for organizations to remain vigilant in\n[implementing cyber security best practices and to keep a watchful eye on threat actors on](https://www.avertium.com/blog/understanding-cybersecurity-best-practices)\nthe rise.\n\n## How Avertium is Protecting Our CUSTOMERS\n\nSometimes anti-malware solutions just aren’t enough.
