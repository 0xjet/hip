The group has\nbeen around for nearly a decade and some researchers believe its members are Korean\nspeakers.\n\nThe attackers targeted their victims using several methods, including through their hotel’s WiFi, zero-day exploits and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing websites. Nearly one year later, the\n[threat group was observed using new attack techniques and an exploit leaked from Italian](https://www.securityweek.com/darkhotel-apt-uses-hacking-team-exploit-target-specific-systems)\nspyware maker Hacking Team.\n\nDarkHotel victims have been spotted in several countries, including North Korea, Russia,\nSouth Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Taiwan, China, the United States, India,\nMozambique, Indonesia and Germany. Up until recently, the attacks appeared to focus on\ncompany executives, researchers and development personnel from sectors such as defense\nindustrial base, military, energy, government, NGOs, electronics manufacturing,\npharmaceutical, and medical.\n\n[In more recent DarkHotel attacks it has dubbed “Inexsmar,” security firm Bitdefender said the](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2017/07/inexsmar-an-unusual-darkhotel-campaign/)\nhackers targeted political figures, and they appeared to be using some new methods.\n\nBitdefender’s analysis is based on samples from September 2016. The initial Trojan\ndownloader, delivered via phishing emails, collects information on the infected device and\nsends it back to its command and control (C&C) server. If the compromised system meets\nrequirements (i.e. it belongs to an individual who is of interest), the first stage DarkHotel\ndownloader, disguised as a component of OpenSSL, is fetched.\n\nIn the meantime, in an effort to avoid raising suspicion, the malware opens a document titled\n“Pyongyang e-mail lists - September 2016,” which provides a list of email contacts for\nvarious organizations in North Korea’s capital city.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the system profile does not match what the attackers are looking for, the C&C server\nreturns a “fail” string and the attack stops. If the attack continues, a second payload is\nretrieved.\n\nWhen Bitdefender analyzed the malware samples, the C&C server was offline, making it\nimpossible to know exactly who the victims were and how much damage was caused.\nHowever, Bitdefender’s Bogdan Botezatu told SecurityWeek that, based on the structure of\nthe phishing message, the intended targets are most likely individuals working for\ngovernments or state institutions who have an interest in the political situation in North\nKorea.\n\nExperts believe that the use of social engineering and a multi-stage downloader is an\nimprovement compared to the direct use of exploits as it gives the attackers more flexibility in\nmalware distribution and ensures that the Trojan remains up to date.\n\n**[Related:Jaku Botnet - Active Operation With Possible Links to Darkhotel APT Group](https://www.securityweek.com/jaku-botnet-active-operation-possibly-controlled-darkhotel-apt-group)**\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n[Eduard Kovacs (@EduardKovacs) is a contributing editor at SecurityWeek.
