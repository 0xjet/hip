These\nIOCs don’t necessarily relate to the defending organization, meaning blue teams regularly\nmiss the actors crafting domains and infrastructure to get beyond their particular defenses.\n\nIt is too easy for the organized crime or espionage group to develop new, bespoke assets to\nattack an organization safe in the knowledge of how to evade traditional security products\nand services. We regularly see assets set up with such specific evasion techniques in mind.\n\nWe see domains registered and then aged for a period of time before malicious use to\navoid aged based reputation scores; we see domains imitating supply chain partners of\nvarious types to avoid security practitioners and potential victims becoming suspicious\n\n\n-----\n\nwhen seeing them in logs; we see rotating name servers and customized name servers in\norder to communicate with specialized malware while avoiding fingerprinting rules and\nbehavior-based detection techniques. At the same time, we see very few innovations from\nsecurity vendors to react to these new techniques. It’s time for the security industry and\nthose defending teams to fight back.\n\nWe want to equip enterprises with the freedom to protect themselves.\n\nEverybody needs their own customized threat intelligence. If an organization can’t\nmeaningfully search for the attacks that are being tailored to them, what chance do they\nhave?\n\nWe are exposing the analytics to help organizations track and trace the very attacker\ninfrastructure being designed just for them. We allow threat intelligence teams to shine a\nlight on this infrastructure as it is going live so they have a chance to proactively defend\ntheir organizations instead of hoping to discover the infrastructure after it’s hit someone\nelse.\n\nEnterprises have been expected to accept ‘black box’ thinking from their security vendors\nfor years: ‘You don’t need to know the details of how we detect things, just pay us the\nmoney and trust that we are defending you.’ That clearly hasn’t worked.\n\nWe are now exposing the underlying connections and patterns to enable enterprises to\ncreate their own intelligence feeds, focused on what they need to defend against.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf 5 threat groups use the same malicious infrastructure provider, then the enterprise needs\nto defend against that infrastructure provider. If numerous advanced threat groups use the\nsame technique of managing and aging domains over time, then the enterprise needs to be\nable to identify domains currently managed with that technique going live. If a virtual Bullet\nProof Hosting Provider is the commonality across numerous campaigns by different groups\nthen a defending enterprise must be able to identify the fingerprint of that provider to defend\nagainst it.\n\nThese are the things we can allow the enterprise to do. We want to empower enterprise\nThreat Intelligence teams with the tools to generate their own new intelligence and to fuse\ntheir current intelligence with new insights that help contextualize and prioritize what\nmatters today.\n\n## Subscribe\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nWe respect your privacy.\n\nThank you!\n\n[Ken Bagnall](http://10.10.0.46/blog?author=6081bc3c4920d358398731f8)\n\n\n-----",
