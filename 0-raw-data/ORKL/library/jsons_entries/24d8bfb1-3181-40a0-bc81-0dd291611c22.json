In the past month, BianLian has been observed being](https://redacted.com/blog/bianlian-ransomware-gang-gives-it-a-go/)\n[deployed against numerous sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, and education. Throughout](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/08/18/bianlian-new-ransomware-variant-on-the-rise/)\nAugust, Redacted researchers reported observing BianLian threat actors rapidly expanding their\ncommand and control (C2) infrastructure and increasing their attack rate.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nBianLian is written in the Go programming language, likely to frustrate reverse engineering efforts by\nsecurity researchers and to make compromising multiple platforms easier for the threat actors\ndeploying the ransomware.\n\nAccording to Redacted researchers, the threat actor appears technically sophisticated in\ncompromising targeted networks, but is likely inexperienced at ransomware operations, based on the\nfollowing behaviors observed during the investigation:\n\nMistakenly sending data from one victim to another.\nPossessing a relatively stable backdoor toolkit but have an actively developing encryption tool\nwith an evolving ransom note.\nLong delays in communications with victims.\nThrough the group’s own admission on their onion site, the business side of their infrastructure\nis unreliable.\n\nRedacted researchers also noted that the BianLian threat actors targeted the ProxyShell vulnerability\nchain (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207) and SonicWall VPN devices to gain\ninitial access into victim networks. The threat actors also employ Living off the Land (LOL)\nmethodology to move laterally, adjusting operations based on defensive controls present on infected\nnetworks.\n\n## Mitigation Options\n\nResearchers with Redacted provided the following defensive measures:\n\nAn aggressive, prioritized patching regime.\nEmploy multi-factor authentication on every system that allows that as an option.\nVisibility into your network and endpoint devices to quickly identify breaches.\nSecure backups to allow return to business operations as soon as possible.\nA well-practiced incident response plan, so everyone involved knows their role.\nAn assessment of your “Crown Jewels” that can be used to both inform your security posture\nand decide ahead of an incident what data you could afford to have leaked so you can avoid\npaying the ransom.\n\nIn addition to these strategic recommendations, there are multiple opportunities for behavioral\ndetections in the attack chain leveraged by BianLian:\n\n\n-----\n\nDefense Evasion: Svchost not a child of services.exe\n\nBianLian called one of their LOL tools svchost, then launched it via a process other than\nservices.exe.\nDefense Evasion: Svchost executing from an unusual path\n\nBianLian called one of their LOL tools svchost.exe, then executed it from a non-standard\npath.\nDefense Evasion: Netsh to modify firewall rules\n\nBianLian leveraged netsh to add a firewall rule to open 3389 to Remote Desktop.\nReconnaissance: Ping -4 -n 1\n\nBianLian used single pings to perform network reconnaissance. This is a false-positive\nprone alert.\nLateral Movement: Winrm dropping a file via PowerShell\n\nThe binary wsmprovhost.exe is used to mediate the relationship between WinRM and\nPowerShell. Alerting on file modification by wsmprovhost.exe proved a reliable method to\ndetect BianLian dropping malicious files.\nLateral Movement: Unknown Binary Established Connection on 3389\n\nIf leveraging an EDR that classifies binaries as known and unknown and ties network\nconnections to binaries, looking for 3389 in use by unknown binaries can be extremely\nfruitful. This rule detects BianLian’s custom Go backdoor.\nCredential Access: Account manipulation via net.exe\n\n“Net user” is too loud to alert on in most environments, but we recommend alerting on a\nthreshold of “net user” executions. Even a threshold as high as 10 events in 15 minutes\nwould have detected BianLian in the attacks witnessed.\nExecution: Unknown binary launching PowerShell\n\nIf leveraging an EDR that classifies binaries as known and unknown, searching for\nunknown binaries launching PowerShell will frequently detect use of the BianLian\nbackdoor\nDefense Evasion: Reg.exe modifying safeboot keys\n\nBianLian added a remote access tool to safeboot keys in order to enable network access\nfor their remote access tool in safeboot.\n\n## IOCs\n\nRedacted researchers provided the following indicators of
