Researchers need to rely on tradecraft and analytic**\n\n**rigor to understand the unseen components of the attack, this often necessitates an intelligence**\n\n**assessment. The use of an intelligence assessment around a set of activity introduces room for**\n\n**error, which is generally balanced with confidences and likelihoods. A window into the mind of the�**\n\n**analyst making these assessments and the difficulty imposed by the ambiguity of looking at the�**\n\n**fragments of an attack can be glimpsed through the case of the malware dubbed Sakula.**\n\n**Sakula is a well known malware variant linked to several significant targeted intrusion campaigns�**\n\n**over the past 2-3 years. This remote access toolkit has been publicly examined multiple times by**\n\n**the threat intelligence community. CrowdStrike has released two blog posts detailing Sakula**\n\n**campaigns and continues to investigate its usage. In the past two years, two campaigns of**\n\n**[Sakula activity stand out as being particularly significant – the �“French Aerospace” Campaign and](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/french-connection-french-aerospace-focused-cve-2014-0322-attack-shares-similarities-2012/)**\n\n**[the “Ironman” Campaign. In recent months, CrowdStrike has observed limited use of what](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/ironman-deep-panda-uses-sakula-malware-target-organizations-multiple-sectors/)**\n\n**appears to be a third Sakula variant.**\n\n**Investigation into the use of Sakula malware leads the CrowdStrike analyst to assess that there is**\n\n**no definitive connection between these three campaigns. Further the analyst assesses that�**\n\n**Sakula is a limited-release tool in use by multiple adversaries. An interesting facet of this**\n\n**malware to highlight, is the apparent connection between the use of Sakula and PlugX. In one**\n\n**case detailed below, Sakula was directly observed as a first stage used to deliver a second stage�**\n\n**PlugX payload, and in another case there is evidence that Sakula and PlugX samples have relied**\n\n**on the same command and control (C2) infrastructure. What follows is a brief discussion of a**\n\n**recent Sakula campaign and a summary of previously observed Sakula activity.**\n\n**The INOCNATION Campaign**\n\n**In early July, CrowdStrike’s Falcon Host technology detected an attack leveraging the CVE-2015-**\n\n**5119 exploit code that was publicly exposed after the breach of the European information security**\n\n**company Hacking Team. The exploit was hosted at www[.]cbppnews[.]com/movie.swf, which**\n\n**CrowdStrike speculates was meant to spoof the website of the US-based think tank “Center on**\n\n**Budget and Policy Priorities”. Upon successful exploitation, a file was saved at�**\n\n**“%Temp%/Rdws.exe” which is executed and writes another file at “%TEMP%/adobe.dat.” This file�**\n\n**was used as a first stage downloader to retrieve a second stage PlugX file that connected to�**\n\n**several C2 domains beginning with cdn[.]sanecat[.]com. Analysis of this first stage downloader�**\n\n**revealed it to be a new variant of Sakula malware.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**investigation of this activity identified malware included in a fake installer alleging to be a security�**\n\n**plugin customized to the target organization. This attack was assessed to be part of highly**\n\n**tailored phishing campaign, which utilized a registered domain purporting to be owned by the**\n\n**target organization’s security team. Once activated, the malware beaconed to port 443 on the**\n\n**same domain used to send the initial phishing email.**\n\n**Finally, a few weeks after the second incident, CrowdStrike identified another sample of the new�**\n\n**Sakula variant. This new file masqueraded as an installer for legitimate software and conducted�**\n\n**C2 communications with the domain inocnation[.]com. This domain appears to be meant to spoof**\n\n**that of a legitimate entity which would indicate the target for this campaign, although it is unclear**\n\n**at this time exactly which organization this may be. Possible candidates for this targeting include**\n\n**the Iraq National Oil Company or the Indian National Overseas Congress.**\n\n**The Ironman Campaign**\n\n**Before the identification of this new variant, CrowdStrike last publicly reported on Sakula in�**\n\n**November 2014. That investigation began in late July 2014 when CrowdStrike identified an�**\n\n**interesting file with zero anti-virus detections being used to drop an older variant of the Sakula�**\n\n**malware. The file was an executable disguised as an installer for Adobe software signed with a�**\n\n**certificate for the organization DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd. When opened, this file displayed a spoofed�**\n\n**webpage for an American university alumni event and also dropped a Sakula payload that**\n\n**communicated with a C2 IP address of 180.210.206.246.**\n\n**Within days of the discovery of this file, two other similar Sakula dropper files were identified that�**\n\n**were also disguised as installers for legitimate software, redirected victims to sites meant to spoof**\n\n**the legitimate sites of the target organizations, and were also signed with the DTOPTOOLZ**\n\n**certificate. These incidents targeted a US-based defense company and the Mongolian�**\n\n**government.**\n\n**The use of a fake installers, spoofed domains, and Sakula malware overlaps the tactics,**\n\n**techniques, and procedures of the Ironman campaign with the activity observed during the**\n\n**INOCNATION Campaign. A table highlighting notable similarities between the Ironman and**\n\n**INOCNATION Campaigns follows.**\n\n**CODE SIMILARITIES** **TTP SIMILARITIES BETWEEN** **NOTABLE DIFFERENCES**\n**WITH OLDER SAKULA** **IRONMAN AND INOCNATION** **BETWEEN OLD AND NEW**\n**SAMPLES** **CAMPAIGNS** **VARIANTS**\n\n**C2 protocol with integer-** **Malware disguised as an installer** **Old variant communicates over**\n**based command ID** **for legitimate software** **plain HTTP; New variant over**\n\n**HTTPS**\n\n**Same dropper used with** **Malware leverages domain** **C2 message formats differ**\n**previous Sakula activities** **spoofing target entity�** **between old and new variants**\n\n**Both variants likely use** **Malware displays spoofed login**\n**same build environment** **page for target entity**\n\n\n-----\n\n**dating back to April 2014 that appeared to be targeted at a healthcare organization and an IT**\n\n**business serving US government clients. One of these files communicated with the domain�**\n\n**we11point[.]com domain which appeared to be a spoof of the website for the healthcare**\n\n**company, WellPoint, which is now known as Anthem. The spoofed domain suggests that the**\n\n**WellPoint healthcare organization was a target in this campaign, and, in fact, in February 2015,**\n\n**Anthem announced a massive data breach which is believed to be the result of a compromise by**\n\n**China-based targeted intrusion actors**\n\n**The Anthem breach announcement preceded a number of similar notifications from other�**\n\n**healthcare entities like Premera and CareFirst, and the U.S. government’s Office of Personnel�**\n\n**Management. Security researchers investigating this activity found additional indicators**\n\n**suggesting that the operators carrying out the DTOPTOOLZ Sakula campaign were the same**\n\n**ones responsible for all of these breaches.**\n\n**It should be noted that a previous blog post discussed possible connections between the Ironman**\n\n**Campaign and CrowdStrike’s DEEP PANDA adversary. Further investigation into this campaign**\n\n**and Sakula activity in general has reduced confidence in this connection and it now appears�**\n\n**unlikely that the two are linked.**\n\n**The French Aerospace Campaign**\n\n**CrowdStrike’s first public report on Sakula activity came in February 2014, as a result of strategic�**\n\n**web compromise (SWC) activity affecting French aerospace-related websites. The SWC**\n\n**leveraged what was, at the time, zero-day exploit code for the CVE-2014-0322 vulnerability. The**\n\n**payload ultimately delivered in these attacks was Sakula connecting to a command and control**\n\n**(C2) domain of oa[.]ameteksen[.]com.**\n\n**Some of the general Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of this operation were shared**\n\n**with a 2012 SWC attack using the website of US-based turbine manufacturer Capstone Turbine**\n\n**to host a zero-day exploit. The tactical similarities include the use of SWC sites to infect victims,**\n\n**the use of exploit code for zero-day vulnerabilities, and overlaps in the infrastructure used.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**been leveraged as C2 for PlugX samples. Furthermore, the Capstone Turbine-related**\n\n**infrastructure also includes multiple domains referencing “GIFAS” which is the acronym for the**\n\n**French Aerospace Industries Association (Groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques**\n\n**et spatiales). GIFAS-themed domains were also used in the February 2014 SWC activity.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n**The Sakula malware demonstrates the difficulty of attribution and the rationale for bookending�**\n\n**technical information with analytic judgements. Sakula has relatively restricted deployments when**\n\n**compared to more widespread RATs used by China-based adversaries such as PlugX. Its use is**\n\n**linked to the use of a number of zero-day exploits and high-profile incidents such as those�**\n\n**resulting in the healthcare and government data breach notifications earlier this year. While its�**\n\n**use is relatively limited, prolonged monitoring of Sakula activity leads the CrowdStrike Intelligence**\n\n**team to assess that it is likely used by a small subset of operators, which, given the access to**\n\n**zero-day exploits and high-profile operations, are likely well-resourced. �**\n\n**For more information on the Sakula malware, feel free to contact us at**\n\n**intelligence@crowdstrike.com.
