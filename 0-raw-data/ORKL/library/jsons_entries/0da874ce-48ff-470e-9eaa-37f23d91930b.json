The power\ncompanies recovered pretty quickly by going to manual operation.\n\nAccess for some time\nThe group that did this had been gaining access to the networks for some time.\n\nThey did similar attacks taking TV stations offline during Ukranian elections a few months\nearlier.\n\nAnd the US government warned about the same group over a year earlier when they found\nthem exploring power stations in the US.\n\nThe attackers tripped circuit breakers by connecting to SCADA consoles with stolen VPN\ncredentials.\nIt was reported the power operators could actually see the attackers taking stuff down on the\nSCADA screens in front of them, but they were locked out so they couldn’t do anything\n\nhttps://www.eenews.net/assets/2016/07/19/document_ew_02.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n- 2 minutes\n\nSo the group behind these are a pretty typical example of medium capability, likely state-linked\nattackers\n\nCustom Developed\nThey have their own 0-days – one was for powerpoint to deliver black energy.\nAnother was for remote access to Generel Electric SCADA software.\nKillDisk was used against file servers. In one case it also took out part of a SCADA system that\nwas running Windows.\n\nCommercial Stuff\nIn terms of commercial stuff – they used remote admin tools like teamviewer and legit tools like\nRDP to blend into the network\n\nBlackEnergy is the malware this group is known for – and indeed sometimes the group are just\nreferred to as BlackEnergy\nBlackenergy has a really weird history, it could kind of it in any of these categories.\nVersion 1 was commercially sold for $700 for the source code, though its now freely available.\nIt was used in DDoS attacks in the Russia-Georgia conflict in 2008.\nVersion 2 was commercially available again, and used by this group and others.\nVersion 3 is used just by this group.\n\nSandworm made great use of open source tools:\n\nOpen Source\nReDuh proxies tcp traffic over http – so you can run all your tools on networks with a strict\nfirewall\nWeevely is a webshell\nDropbear is an unfortunately named SSH server\nAnd DSE fix allows you to run unsigned drivers on Windows\n\nTools for the job\nSo as you might expect they use whatever tools they need for the job.\nThey cherry pick open source tools to augment their capabilities as they need it – and that’s\ntypical of most groups that don’t have the resources to custom design everything.\n\nAttribution\nIt can also help blur the attribution.\nFor example WannaCry has code overlaps with North Korean malware – you won’t get those\nkinds of hints with something open source\n\nThese middle capability groups have been where the growth in open source seems to be\nrecently.\n\n\n-----\n\nTheres an Iranian group called Newscaster and a Russian group called Fancy Bear that have\nbeen using customised versions of the open source BeeF browser exploitation framework\nrecently in watering holes.\n\nIn the case of Fancy Bear that has meant using it in the place of an exploit kit that they had\nalready built themselves\n\nThey can quickly adapt the source to their needs, and operators can quickly pick up new tools\nwhen their custom main toolset is either too easily detected or attributed\n\nIn contrast\nLow skilled attackers have always needed free or open source software.\nBut there is a big jump in low quality criminals taking advantage of things like open source\nransomware to gain funds\nThe danger here is they then re-invest their stolen cash into other attacks\n\nAnd at the other endAnother far more capable Russian group called Turla started out in the 90s using source code\ntaken, pretty much exclusively, from Phrack magazine – but they now have their own platforms.\n\n- They do some crazy stuff with using satellite connections for command and control and other\nvery clever things to evade detection\n\n- 40 seconds\n\nThere were follow up attacks a couple of weeks later, perhaps trying to regain lost access\n\nThis time instead of their beloved blackenergy malware, they were using something called Gcat\n\nGcat is an open source backdoor that uses gmail for command and control.\n\nPerhaps Sandworm were concerned that blackenergy was being too easily detected.\n\nOr perhaps they didn’t want the targets to know it was the same people behind these later\nattacks. It was still obvious though as they hadn’t changed their macro code that delivered the\nmalware.\n\nThe author of Gcat was understandably a little upset about this, and it’s no longer developent\n\nTo be clear- I’m not in anyway saying the author of Gcat is responsible for these attacks. There\nare plenty of rats out there to choose form and he happened to have written one that was pretty\nreliable -- and pretty hard to detect.\n\n\n-----\n\n- 1 minute – Shorten this?\n\nBut it does make you worry about the worst case\n\nHere are a bunch of videos on how to use freely available tools - like njRat - to hack into\npeople’s computers\n\nNow obviously there are tons of videos like this on Youtube- but what’s different here is that the\nauthor claims affiliation at points to either Al Qaeda or ISIS.\nI’m not sure how seriously to take this guy, given he seems confused about which competing\nterrorist organisation he’s in.\nBut it does make you worry about the kind of worst cases.\n\nInterestingly - I think he hosted these videos on the internet archive as Youtube and Facebook\ntook down his earlier videos\nIn terms of how this information is shared – the internet archive is a stretched charity – they\ndidn’t have time to reply to my email about this.\n\nThat’s probably why the internet archive is banned in Russia for hosting terrorist content. That\nmight also be why it was used by Russia to host the files they stole from President Macrons\ncampaign team - during the recent french elections.\n\nSimiliarly if Github started blocking open source Rats from having a home – they’d just be\nhosted somewhere else.\n\n30 seconds\n\nFast forward a year to December 2016 – and ESET reported on new attacks mostly targeting\nthe finance sector in Ukraine\n\nBy now Sandworm had re-tooled and were using a custom backdoor again. This time it looked\nlike a Gcat inspired backdoor that instead uses Telegram for command and control\n\nThey’d built their own tunneling software to replace Reduh – you can see the help file there\n\nAnd they’d also upgraded their KillDisk malware to leave this scary desktop background \n  - 5 seconds\nThere you are – inspired by Mr Robot apparently\n\n\n-----\n\n15 seconds \nAnd this is still going on– more attacks were reported this Christmas\n\nAnd - stock footage really is taking it to the extreme - isnt it?\n\nNot only is he wearing a hoodie in the dark – but he’s also staring at a roomful of anonymous\nmasks\n\n- 30 seconds\n\nSo Mirai is very well known – some guy wrote a worm that infects internet of things devices to\nbuild a botnet\n\nWhich was then used for DDoS attacks\n\nHe lots of attention after launching the biggest ever DDoS attack against Krebs – and at that\npoint he decided to open source it\n\nI think the reason he released it onto Hackforums was probably to get some of the heat off him\n\nIf a ton of script kiddies are also using your malware, it’s a bit harder to tie you to a particular\nattack\n\n- 30 seconds\n\nSince then someone has modified the Mirai source code added the ability to exploit some\nvulnerabilities in more home routers\n\nLots of mirai attacks are still going on – someone recently use one to try and knock malware\ntechs WannaCry sinkhole off\n\nInterestingly there’s also a worm called Hajime that is inspired by Mirai but far better built – that\ngoes round closing security holes in internet of things devices\n\n- 10 seconds\n\nSo hidden tear is a pretty well known piece of open source ransomware\nI’ve seen a few articles on it already – so you may not know it already\n\nBut I havent seen anything that covers all the ups and downs of the story\n\n\n-----\n\n- 1 minute\nSo it was released by Utku, who I believe was a university student at the time\nSo you might ask – why would you create open source ransomware?\nHe said he released it as an educational tool so people could understand how ransomware\nworks better\nThe disclaimer said it was for educational use only\nAn article said it was to impress a girl – the later version called Eda was apparently named after\nher\nIt was named a ransomware honeypot, and later implied it was to get bad actors to use a weak\ncrypto implementation\n\nI think it was probably just curiosity and a bit of self publicity to get into the industry. Which I’ve\ncertainly released tools for before, just with less risky consequences\n\nThe code itself is pretty much what you’d expect – a few hundred lines of Visual basic that\nencrypts files only within one folder\n\n- 10 seconds\n\nSome people suggested he should add a backdoor, though he chose not to\n\nAnd users discussing the code on Reddit pointed out a number of potential issues with the\nimplementation of the encryption\n\nI’ll go into those in a bit\n\n10 seconds\n\nOf course It didn’t take long before real world ransomware started to take advantage of HiddenTear\n\nThis was one of the first – it infected users of a website in Paraguay\n\n- 10 seconds\n\nUtku saw the report and offered to help get the victims their files back\n\n\n-----\n\n- 1 minute\n\nSo I mentioned some issues with the implementation of the crypto in HiddenTear earlier\n\nThe key is generated from the system time\n\nIt uses a call to Environment.TickCount - a 32 bit integer – so it only has about 2 billion values\nOn a modern machine that could be brute forceable in it self\n\nBut the other weakness is that this value is the time that HiddenTear started.\n\nSo all you need to do is get the time the first file got encrypted, within a certain window of time.\n\nSo that’s how Utku broke his own crypto.\n\nHe attempted to decrypt a file that he knew the contents of until he’d found the key. This flaw\nwas actually pointed out by other users, and was inspired by Bitdefender’s decryption of Linux\nEncoder\n\nIn that case it didn’t work a lot of the time – because Linux Encoder is so dumb it often encrypts\nfiles in multiple rounds or simply accidentally deletes them – rendering them unrecoverable\n\n-15 seconds\n\nAfter HiddenTear Utku later released an improved\n\nMost of the crypto flaws were removed – and he added features such as setting the desktop\nbackground\n\n- 15 seconds\n\nSo – lets say that you want to play Far Cry\n\nAnd I can it does look pretty fun, looking at this dude with antlers on his head\n\nBut unfortunately you’ll have to pay 39 pounds and 99 pence – that’s a lot of money\n\n\n-----\n\n-20 seconds\nSo naturally you’ll want to Google for a crack\n\nSo the first result in Google when looking for a crack is this youtube video\n\n- Google makes sure that Youtube ranks well in search results\n\nAnd it’s great that these two lovely people are going to give you Farcry for free\n\n- You can probably see where this is going\n\n  - 5 seconds\nBut oh no – they lied\nActually the crack just installs this ransomware – based on eda2\n\n-15 seconds\n\nThe worst thing about this ransomware is the ransom note the guy gives user sis really\narrogant\n\nYou’ll never be able to find me (Voice)\nEven the NSA cant get your files back\n\n- 20 seconds\n\nSo Utku to the rescue again\nHe saw users on the bleeping computer forums reporting they’d lost their files in the\nransomware attack\nAnd he logged into the command and control server using a backdoor he’d secretly left in Eda2\n\nI’ve got to say – in the UK I think this might be a violation of the computer misuse act\n\n- 25 seconds\n\nOf course it wasn’t long before someone made a fork that improved on EDA2\nThey improved the security of the encryption and added some other features\n\nThey said they made it for law enforcement…\nIf anyone here is from law enforcement perhaps they can thank them\n\n\n-----\n\n- 10 seconds\n\nEmpinel – the author of Stolich – actually missed the backdoor in EDA2 at first\n\nbut other users let them know and they then removed it\n\n- 10 seconds\n\nSo, lets say you want to play minecraft…\nYou can probably see where this is going\n\n- 20 seconds\n\nOh no – it’s a backdoored minecraft installer\n\nI’m not sure how to pronounce this\nEither Laughing My Ass Off at You?\nOr LmaoxUs\n\nBut yeah this is based on Stolich\n\n- 60 seconds\n\nThis all happened a few months ago, but he’s only removed the code from Github a couple of\nweeks ago\n\nOf course, forks are still available on github so the code is still available for anyone to find\n\nI was surprised when I looked into this to find the guy that forked EDA2 and wrote Stolich is\nonly 13 years old\n\nSo I give him a bit of a pass given hes only 13. Maybe when he’s older he can try to stop\nransomware instead, which is a much harder job.\n\nAnd the other point here is that stuff stays with you.\n\nThe line at the bottom is a very immature - disclaimer from a password cracker I wrote ad open\nsourced when I was the same age as this guy\n\nI was a teenager then but all the tutorials and zines I used to write as a kid are still floating\naround in various places\n\n\n-----\n\n  - 10 seconds\nHere’s a another piece of ransomware - called Magic - that is forked from EDA2\n\n- 30 seconds\n\nThe good guys took down the command and control server – but that also meant that the\ndecryption keys were lost and the backdoor wouldnt work\n\nThe malware author offered to provide a backup he had made of the keys\n\nBut only if Utuk took down the source code for HiddenTear and Eda2\n\nIt isnt clear just why he wanted HiddenTear taking down, perhaps having openly available\nransomware was hurting his business\n\n____\n\nhttps://www.utkusen.com/blog/project-eda2-is-abandoned-due-to-magic-ransomwareincident.html\n\nI removed all the files and commits of Eda2 project. Since nobody is discovered the backdoor\nof Eda2, I won’t reveal it right now. Because we may deal with new Eda2 implementations in\nfuture.\nI’m sorry, I failed this time.\n\n- 15 seconds\n\nSo Utku took the code for them down\n\nLooking at the commit logs though, he did have enough time to upgrade the logo to EDA2 first\n\nBut thankfully the attacker did give the encryption keys back so people could get their files\n\n___\n\nhttp://news.softpedia.com/news/ransomware-author-blackmails-security-researcher-whorefuses-to-give-in-499437.shtml\n\nUPDATE: After further discussions, the blackmail attempt turned into full-on negotiations, but\nUtku Sen and the ransomware operator have come to an agreement.\n\nUtku will take down the Hidden Tear repository in three days while the author of the Magic\nransomware will provide all the encryption keys for free for the next 15 days. Victims should\nemail the ransomware operator at viper1990@safe-mail.net.\n\n\n-----\n\n- 25 seconds\n\nSo even though the code is removed from the original Github repository – it’s still available via:\n\n- The Commit history\n\n- Forks – you can see some up here\n-There are Improved versions too\nPorts – you can see one person decided to port it to C++ for some reason\nAnd also other malware inspired by the overall design decisions in HiddenTear\n\n- 20 seconds\n\nAnd there have been a ton of ransomware attacks using the Hidden Tear and EDA2 code\nYou can see here some of them….\n“Don’t Download Random Shit on the Internet” one says up there..

Does it look familiar?\n\nThis variant came out the same time as WannaCry\n\nIt’s a bit like those insects that impersonate more dangerous ones so they don’t get eaten\n\n- 15 seconds\n\nYou’ve probably heard of this one\nRequires you to play a weird anime game and get a certain score to get your files back\nWhich is strange\nThe author later apologised and released a tool to get peoples files back\n\n- 5 seconds\n\nThis one doesn’t actually ask for any money, says its just to educate people about ransomware,\nand gives you your files back for free\n\n- 20 seconds\n\nThis one probably scares me the most – its ransomware as a service\nYou pay $175 dollars and then you have a platform to spread ransomware from\n\nit includes a HiddenTear variant\n\nIt’s a very low cost entry into ransomware for criminals, and the money they make might get\nreinvested in more attacks\n\n- 25 seconds\n\nSo this is a great map of all the ransomware families F-Secure tagged over time\n\nI meant to highlight which ones were based on hiddentear- but it was taking too long\n\nWhen I was counting it was looking to be around 1 in 5, which is a pretty high amount\n\nOf course this doesn’t take into account how much each variant spread\n\nSo something like Locky, which is custom developed, is underrepresented here\n\n\n-----\n\n- 25 seconds\n\nTrend Micro have some numbers – these are the unique families based on Hidden Tear that\nthey’re seeing\n\nAgain this doesn’t take into account how widely those families are being seen though\n\nThis goes up to March – look at the samples we’re getting I’d guess it’s stayed pretty stable\nbetween March and May\n\n- 20 seconds\n\nI’ve always found it funny seeing disclaimers like “for educational use only”\nAs far as I can tell these mean nothing\n\nAlso I’ve read, though I am definitely not a lawyer myself,\nThat Open source license means you cant dictate usage\n\nAnd again from what I’ve read the Wassenaar treaty on arms control doesn’t apply to open\nsource software\n\n- 30 seconds\n\nAnd finally, 2sec who these days is probably best known as Malware Tech’s mate\nMade this poll- Do people think open source ransomware is a good thing?\n\nHe got pretty much 50/50 – so as a rough show of hands\nPut your hands up if you think open source ransowmare is a good idea\nAnd bad?\n\n….\n\nAnyway – so that’s hiddentear\n\n15 seconds\n\nSo – the next section is mostly on leaked source code.\nIt’s not open source in the sense that there isn’t a license explicitly allowing you to use the code\n– but then if you’re deploying malware you’re probably not to bothered about license anyway\n\n\n-----\n\n- 1 minute\n\nProbably the most famous leaked code is from shadow brokers\nThey leaked a bunch of exploits and tools allegedly stolen from the NSA\n\nThis was actually taken down when first republished onto github, from somewhere else\nAnd it wasn’t taken down because of the exploits\nIt was taken down because they included the auction message from the shadow brokers\n– and you’re not allowed to ask for cash on Github\n\nTo be fair Github has got a pretty hard job deciding what to allow or not\nFor example they don’t allow compiled malware\nBut they do allow you to host scripts that can you can run as is\nSo I’ve seen on incident response jobs, attackers running powershell mimikatz straight off of\ngithub.com\nAnd that’s a pain to detect at the network level without ssl terminators\nSo you just see an encrypted connection to Github.com\nIts also a pain to stop with application whitelisting as it’s not an executable\nthough there’s plenty you can do to detect malicious powershell usage\n\n- 50 seconds\n\nOne of these exploits is EternalBlue – the SMB version 1 exploit made famous by its abuse in\nWannaCry\n\nThe exploit was leaked back in April, and some people were playing with it when it came out\n\nBut WannaCry didn’t happen until a month after those exploits were released\n\nAn analysis by BAE showed that WannaCry used an easier to use version of the exploit\n\n- Developed just a couple of days before WannaCry spread to Github\n\nIf they hadn’t released this version of the exploit – would WannaCry have still happened?\n\nAnd now its in metasploit…\nAnd whenever things end up in metasploit – you quickly see that code being reused in malware\n\n\n-----\n\n- 80 seconds\n\nThis is leaked source code from Fancy bear or APT28\nFunnily enough there’s a good chance these are the same guys behind Shadow Brokers,\n\n- So what goes around - comes around\n\nThey left two of their command and control servers open so anyone could grab the source code\n\nAlso in terms of sharing is caring\nA journalist leaked the analysis that one of the security guys at Google had done on this\nmalware\nAnd that’s a whole other side of sharing is caring – on the defensive side- that I don’t have time\nto cover in this talk\nThe product that I work on, OTX, we have problems with getting the sharing right.\nWe really want users to share information on attacks there, but we’ve also had plenty of cases\nof people using our platform to leak vendors private threat intelligence reports\nAnd some of that is pretty sensitive- both commercially because we don’t want people stealing\nother peoples intellectual property\nBut more importantly because if attackers see there’s a private report on their malware, clearly\nthey will change how they operate and then we won’t be able to detect them anymore\n___\n\nJournalist leaked Google report – sharing is caring – tlp amber\n\n- 45 seconds\n\nHacking team are a very controversial surveillance company\nThey sell exploits and malware to law enforcement\n\nBut they also have a habit of not only selling to regimes that would use it for things like counter\nterrorism, but also to places where they use it against dissidents and journalists that criticse the\ngovernment\n\nSo someone hacked them and put all their stuff on Github…\n\nThe exploits were used almost immediately\n\nPirated versions of HackingTeams malware has been seen in targeted attacks by Russian\nnationalists.\nThey’re quite a low capability group but pretty dangerous\nWhen Putin talks about nationalist hackers it could be these guys he means – but these aren’t\nthe group that are impacting elections\n\n\n-----\n\n- 50 seconds\n\nShadowserver did a really nice analysis of how two of the Hacking team leaked exploits were\npackaged up and used by some groups based in China\n\nIt looks like there was one central development shop - or quartermaster, that packaged up the\nexploits then shared them with various other China based groups\n\nAnd this is something you see a lot with targeted attacks\n\nI saw something similar when looking at groups that used a Chinese exploit framework, which\nis a frankenstein of various open source bits of code, and is distributed from one central\ndevelopment shop\n\n- 35 seconds\n\nSo Carberp was a banking trojan that made many millions of pounds a few years ago\nIt was built by about 25 programmers who all worked remotely, they were paid a couple of\nthousand dollars to write modules to extend the trojan\nMost worked around the black sea, which is a hot bed for this kind of high end cyber crime\n\nIt’s always interesting to see whose behind a big operation like this – you can see one of the\nringleaders getting arrested here\n-hes not having a good day\nHe lives in Moscow and made the mistake of targeting a ton of Russian banks\n\nAnd what happened after these guys were arrested is pretty much the same as what happened\nwith the Zeus banking malware\n\nThe code was soon being sold on forums by people who had access, and finally it got leaked\nenough it was freely available\n\n___\n\nShow video from\nhttps://life.ru/t/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/86143\nSummarise\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/carberp/\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/07/02/all-carberp-botnet-organizers-arrested/\nhttp://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF8&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kommersant.ua%2Fdoc%2F2160535&act=url&act=url&act=url\n\n\n-----\n\n2 minutes\n\nAnd it seems that everyone uses Carberp!\n\nBoth Carberp and Zeus are used as the basis for most banking malware sold on forums today\n\n- To the extent that people selling malware advertise if their malware isn’t based on Zeus and\nCarberp – because they are now so easy to detect\n\nSofacy or APT28 use it in some of their code, together with Metasploit\n\n- They are a very well resourced organisation, but it makes sense for them to develop as\nquickly as possible given they have a remit to hack thousands of people every year\n\nIt was pretty well reported on that Wikileaks leaked what is apparently CIA tools and malware\nrecently\nOne of the things in that massive dump is a backdoor which uses parts of Carberp\nIts nice to see them saving tax payer money\nThey also say that they’ve carefully vetted the code for vulnerabilities and backdoors,\nwhich is quite hard to do\n\nThe quote here comments that making Carberp, which previously cost $40k, available to\neveryone is like “handing a bazooka to a child”\n\n- Which makes you wonder what the comparison would be for making entire NSA and CIA\nentire platforms, worth many millions of pounds, freely available is like\n\nMaybe its more like handing a nuke to a child, and that’s why we have things like WannaCry\n\n- 10 seconds\n\nSo are there some upsides to all this open source malware and leaked code being available to\nanyone?\n\n- 15 seconds\n\nAs mentioned earlier, when everyone bases their malware on the same code base it can make\nit easier to detect\nMost HiddenTear variants are detected pretty trivially as HiddenTear\nThere are packers and obfuscators though that can make the job more difficult\n\n\n-----\n\n- 40 seconds\n\nFor one thing having the source code for Carberp made it easier to find vulnerabilties\nAnd looking at it some of the code is actually pretty terrible\nSo it didn’t take long before researchers found they could remotely take control of Carberp\ncommand and control servers\nAnd whilst people can fork Carberp and fix these holes – I havent seen anyone do it.\n\nI guess it’s hard to get the many eyes advantages of open source when there’s not a central\nactive developer for leaked code\n\nSo up here on the screen are some command and control servers that Xylitol took over\n\n10 And finally I didn’t have space on the slides to thank everyone whose screenshots and\nresearch I used, so many thanks to them\n\n20 \nSo – that’s it �\nAny questions?\n\n## Just for you: FREE 60-day trial to the world’s largest digital library.\n\nThe SlideShare family just got bigger.
