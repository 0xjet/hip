One that it is\ndominated by the petrochemical industry, nuclear\nenrichment, an ideological framework, regional turmoil\nand relative isolation[4]. Since the fall of the Soviet\nUnion and the increased presence of US troops in the\nregion, it has had to handle perceived existential threat\nfrom the US and its allies and a unique set of regional\ninfluences[5]. Overall Iran experiences cordial relations\nwith South Caucasus and Central Asia, underpinned\nby a pragmatic outlook that does not want to upset\nMoscow or Beijing. It sees Armenia as its “gateway to\nEurope” and Turkmenistan as its “gateway to Central\nAsia”. Iran prioritises relations from the Persian Gulf\nand Levant alongside Turkey. It sees Israel and Saudi\nArabia as threats to its existence and its future as the\ndominant regional power. Iran’s nuclear ambitions have\nbeen the cause for ongoing international sanctions\nagainst its financial, petrochemical, transportation and\nshipping sectors. Reports surrounding their enrichment\nprogram suggest the country is a long way off equipping\nmissiles with nuclear warheads and that for the most\n\n\npart they have an abundance of conventional missiles[6].\nHowever, the goal to become a nuclear power is in\nalignment with its regional ambitions to have better US\ndeterrence and more regional political leverage. The\nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), set forth\nrequirements for Iran to halt its uranium enrichment,\nand make efforts to alter regional activities, including\nsupporting proxy groups and terrorist organisations, for\nsome sanctions relief. The US Trump administration has\nadopted an oppositional outlook towards Tehran once\nagain however, as evidenced by changing their position\non the JCPOA.\n\n#### Internal security posture\n\nSecuring control of its internal political space is a top\npriority for the Iranian regime. The ability to cause societal discontent through online communication channels,\nand generate conflict was felt keenly by the Middle East\nin the aftermath of the Arab Spring in 2011. Since then,\nIran has invested in internal internet governance and\npursued a hard-line stance against perceived dissident\nor anti-revolutionary activity. The Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps (IRGC) website details some of the country’s\n\n\n1.

The pursuit of internal control has led to the implementation of\nthe National Information Network (NIN). This is based\non ideas to monitor internet usage, and block subversive content, not unlike SORM of Russia and the “Great\nChinese Firewall”. The data captured by this national\nintranet can be accessed by the country’s intelligence\nand law enforcement agencies[8]. Freedom of expression\nis regularly reported as being restricted as well. Iranian\nlegislation makes many non-violent crimes punishable\nby death. Many ordinary users of social media have been\nbrought to the IRGC or arrested for making comments\non controversial issues (such as fashion)[9]. In 2016 Iran\ncarried out the largest mass executions in years. Despite\nbeing considered a moderate, President Rouhani has\nbeen accused of not doing enough to counter the more\nhard-line actions of the judiciary or the IRGC[10].\n\n#### Economy\n\nIran is the second largest economy (after Saudi Arabia)\nin the Middle East and North African region (MENA),\nand has the second largest population after Egypt[11]. The\ncountry relies heavily on oil revenues. Rigorous implementation of sanctions over the last several years have\nbeen hard hitting on the economy. Between 2011 and\n2014 the currency took a nosedive as the Rial lost 80% of\nits value against the dollar[12]. Iran has the second largest\nproven natural gas deposits globally, and could counter\nthe impact of sanctions on oil, but it requires foreign\ninvestment. Due to the sanctions, many countries and\ncompanies have shied away from investing in Iran’s gas\ndeposits. Despite some gains under previous sanctions in the international community’s eyes, present US\nleadership does not seem to articulate a very promising\noutlook. However, Europe, Russia, China and India have\n\n### Supreme National Security Council (SNSC)\n\n\nall voiced opposition to Trump s unilateral stance. During\n2016 the economy experienced a notable recovery.\n\n## National Cyber-Strategy\n\nIran’s attention was drawn to the development of its\nown offensive and defensive cyber capability after being\nattacked by the Stuxnet virus, followed by Duqu and\nFlame. The government pledged $1 billion investment\nin 2011[13], creating the Supreme Council of Cyberspace\n(SCC), Cyber Headquarters (under the Armed Forces\nGeneral Staff), Cyber Command, the Basij cyberspace\ncouncil, Cyber Police FETA and began recruiting talent\ninto the industry. ICT ministries cooperated with the\nAFGS Cyber Headquarters to monitor vulnerabilities\nand threats to infrastructure. The SCC works with the\nNational Center of Cyberspace under the direction of\nPresident Hassan Rouhani and Secretary Abolhassan\nFirouzabadi, coordinating and implementing cyberspace\npolicy in Iran[14]. The MAHER/ Iran National CERT is\nresponsible for incident response[15]. Since Stuxnet, Iran\nhas matured into one of the more advanced actors\nglobally, not afraid of being offensively oriented.\n\n## Iranian Intelligence and Cyber Services\n\nThe fast development of Iran’s cyber capability has meant\nthat a number of organisations have been either created\nor have developed their own subdivisions to carry out\nactivity. The Supreme National Security Council under\nthe auspices of the Supreme Leader Khamenei, seems\nto oversee all of the different intelligence services. The\nmost prominent intelligence service seems to be the\nMinistry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), which works\nin conduit with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp’s\n(IRGC) Quds-Force and intelligence unit.\n\n\nHead:\nPresident:\nAreas of Concern:\n\n\nSupreme Leader Ali Hoseini-Khamenei\nPresident Hassan Fereydoon Rouhani\nTo “watch over the Islamic revolution and safeguard the Islamic Republic of Iran’s national\ninterests”.

This is because\nof the unique regional influences it has to contend\nwith, including a number of global powers exercising\ndirect and indirect power over its affairs. Because of\nthe early trauma of the Stuxnet virus, Iran has been\nable to experience first-hand the impact of such a\ncampaign. With investment, a sophisticated offensive\ncyber capability could grant Iran the leverage it craves\nas a US deterrent and regional power. Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that Iran capitalized on the attack and has\nsince aggressively pursued its own capability. They are\nalready more mature than most of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil states (GCC).\n\nOne of the major worries from the international\ncommunity, voiced in the implementation of sanctions\nover the years, has been Tehran’s support of proxygroups. Some of these groups, labelled as terrorist\norganisations, operate in regional conflict hotspots such\nas Palestine, Yemen and Syria. Iran provides training\nand resources to groups such as Lebanese Hezbollah,\nBadr Corps, Kata’ib Hezbollah and Asa’ib ahl al-Haq[38]. In\na similar fashion (and not unlike other global powers),\nthe Islamic Republic has been using hacktivist groups\nto support its endeavours and further their own aims.\nThere has even been reports that Iran may has been\nfunding the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA)[39 40]. Its overt\nsupport for Hezbollah, Houthis and Hamas are paralleled\nin accusations that Iran is helping to form cyber units for\nproxy groups as well.\n\nParallels can be drawn between those countries that\nIran perceives as a priority threat to the security of\nthe republic, and attributed cyber campaigns. This is\nevidenced by US indictment of several Iranian individuals\nbelieved to be associated with the IRGC. The indictment\nis in response to denial of service attacks against US\nfinancial entities between 2011 and 2013[41]. In 2012,\n\n\nthe destructive Shamoon virus targeted Saudi Aramco\n(Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company). Saudi is a\ncompeting regional power led by a Sunni government\nthat Iran is in direct confrontation with. This manifests\nin the surrounding conflicts and in the energy industry.\nThey also share a long-term, overarching historic notion\nof religious superiority that is in direct conflict (Sunni\nvs Shia). This ideological conflict is entrenched and is\nunlikely to be resolved.\n\n## Future Concerns\n#### Saudi Arabia\n\nThe relationship between Riyadh and Tehran has been\ntenuous and complex at best. The two regional powers\nare usually discussed in context of their ideologically\nopposed religious affiliation, Saudi Arabia has majority\nSunni population whilst Iran is Shia. The conflict between\nthe two countries was deepened more recently by a\nharsh anti-Iranian resolution issued at the UN in 2016,\nand the execution of a prominent Shia cleric Sheikh\nNimr al-Nimr[42]. When Iran was given the opportunity to\nstart participating in the international economic system\nagain, Saudi Arabia viewed this with alarm[43]. Given the\npragmatic approach Iran has displayed towards meeting\nits requirements in the JCPOA, some would suggest that\nIran is not going to be provocative and offensive. Saudi is\nbetter financed militarily and better equipped. However,\nin the long-term, Iran sees itself as progressing and\nonly becoming more influential whilst Saudi Arabia\nhas to contend with maintaining an edge. Iran is likely\nto continue to use indirect means to undermine Saudi\nArabia, using proxy-groups and disinformation.\n\n#### The United States\n\nThe United States has already been the at the receiving\nend of some of Iran’s offensive activity. The US is responsible for the implementation of harsh international\nsanctions that have demonstrably impacted the Iranian\neconomy. The JCPOA, agreed upon by moderate President Hassan Rouhani with the P5+1, provided some\n\n\n33. https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/270968/assets/Cleaver/Cylance_Operation_Cleaver_Report.pdf\n34. http://www.clearskysec.com/tulip/\n35. http://www.iranwatch.org/iranian-entities/passive-defense-organization\n36. https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/154842/No375_15OCT2012.pdf\n37. https://phoenixts.com/blog/the-iranian-cyber-threat-part-1-irans-total-cyber-structure/\n38. https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/congressional_testimony/ts161206_Dalton_Testimony.pdf\n39. https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nze5nk/the-syrian-electronic-armys-most-dangerous-hack\n40. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-cyberspace-analysis/analysis-syria-aided-by-iran-could-strike-back-at-u-s-incyberspace-idUSBRE97S04Z20130829\n41. https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/iranian-ddos-attacks\n42. https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/the-iran-saudi-arabia-conflict-and-its-impact-the-organization-islamic-cooperation\n43. http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/iran-nuclear-deal-fuels-tension-saudi-arabia-inflaming-new-conflicts\n\n\n-----\n\nsanctions relief and this contributed to economic growth in\n2016. However, the real threat of fresh and revived sanctions from the Trump administration is likely to hurt Iran’s\nrenewed optimism and hostility can already be observed.\nConfounded by a mixture of Anti-American sentiment based\non historic regional US interference, Iran is unlikely to stop\nperceiving the US as an adversary in the near future. Consequently, the US is a worthy adversary to conduct asymmetric activity against. This may manifest in both direct\nand indirect campaigns. It is probably not a coincidence\nthat a country under harsh sanctions against its financial\nsector has historically targeted the financial sector of the\nsaid persecutor (US). This might be repeated, if so then the\nmirror target for the IRGC would be US Cyber Command or\nanother government/military adversary. he ability for Iran\nto think strategically has been observed too though. It may\nopt for continuing its tradition of using proxy-groups to\nprovoke and attack larger better equipped forces it doesn’t\nreally want a full-scale war with[44].\n\n#### Israel\n\nIran has pursued an aggressive stance towards Israel since\nfall of the Soviet Union, after which it severed diplomatic\nrelations. This may have been due in part, for the need to\nappeal to Arab and Muslim opinion whilst relations were\nredefined in that era. The then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad used very anti-Semitic language[45]. The creation\nof the state of Israel, and expansion of settlements, is a\nhistoric wound and reminder of Western interference in the\nregion. Israel is accused of being behind the Stuxnet virus\nalongside the US. Iran is accused of funding and equipping\nPalestinian paramilitary group Hamas with missiles. During\nOperation Protective Edge in 2014, in which 2,100 Palestinians (mostly civilians)[46] were killed by the Israel Defense\nForce (IDF), Iran is attributed to a number of cyber-attacks\nagainst Israeli entities[47]. This relationship is unlikely to\nchange in the near future as Israel is viewed as a justifiable\nadversary to attack and undermine through any means.\n\n#### Kazakhstan\n\nThe location of Kazakhstan combined with it being the top\nproducer of Uranium, makes this country a very important ally of Iran. Sanctions impacted economic exchanges\nbetween the two states. Diplomatic relations between the\ntwo countries have come under suspicion in the past as Iran\n\n\nis accused of only being interested in knowledge transfer\nfrom Kazakstan’s scientists and as a source of Uranium[48].\nInternational suspicion has led Kazakhstan to be demonstrably cautious in its dealings with Tehran. Iran’s interest\nin Kazakhstan’s scientists could be an area of intellectual\ntheft and cyber espionage as part of achieving its nuclear\nambitions.\n\n#### Syria/Iraq\n\nTehran supports President Bashar al-Assad along with\nRussia in the Syrian civil war. Continued engagement in\nthis area is highly likely. Iran shares a border with Iraq, so\nthe outcome of the conflict and the need for a pro-Iranian government is important. Iran is likely to continue to\nundermine any progress Western-backed, or Saudi-backed\nforces make in the area through proxy-groups, cyber-attacks and conventional military support.\n\n#### Latin America\n\nIran has reportedly operated an intelligence network in\nLatin America for decades[49]. The network is believed to\nbe channeled through embassies, mosques and affiliation\nthrough Hezbollah. Hezbollah’s presence in the region has\nbeen linked to organized crime and as a means for revenue[50]. Iran is also not shy about conducting cyber-attacks\nin Latin America. A recent report showed Iran, working\nin conduit with Venezuela, planning an attack against US\nsystems made to look like it originated from Mexico[51].\nVenezuela and Iran are both coping with oil sanctions, and\nare working with Syria to construct a new refinery. With\nthis in mind, it would not be unreasonable to assume Iran\nwill continue to penetrate Latin America for intelligence\npurposes, to subvert some of the constraints placed by\ninternational sanctions and as a means for proxy attacks.\n\n#### South Caucasus and Central Asia\n\nDespite cordial relations with the majority of states in this\nregion, Iran has to be very strategic in how it handles its\nrelationships and access to resources. This is because of\nthe competing influences of China and Russia. Azerbaijan\nhas also been very close to Israel, exchanging defence technology and increased trade. This has given Iran some cause\nfor concern. Any opportunity to understand the web of\ninterests in this area is likely to be taken advantage of. This\nmight indicate an area of interest for espionage campaigns.\n\n\n44. http://www.soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-irans-growing-cyber-capabilities/\n45. http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/iran-and-israel\n46. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28439404\n47. https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/183365/No.%20598%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Sami%20for%20web.pdf\n48. https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/160420_Milani_IranReconnectingEurasia_Web.pdf\n49. https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column_article/iran-and-hezbollah-remain-hyperactive-in-latin-america\n50. http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2015/mar/18/irans-influence-latin-america\n51. http://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/iran-conducting-anti-us-operations-latin-america\n\n\n-----",
