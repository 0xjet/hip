The following month US\n[authorities seized 63.7 bitcoins that made up the affiliate’s share of the 75 BTC Colonial](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-authorities-seize-darkside)\nPipeline ransom payment.\n\nDarkSide is an example of “Ransomware as a Service” (RaaS). In this operating model, the\nmalware is created by the ransomware developer, while the ransomware affiliate is\nresponsible for infecting the target computer system and negotiating the ransom payment\nwith the victim organisation.\n\nThe DarkSide developer maintained a wallet to hold its share of the ransom payments —\n[including 11.3 bitcoins from the Colonial payment. On May 13, DarkSide claimed that its](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-servers-reportedly-seized-operation-shuts-down/)\ninfrastructure, including the wallet, had been seized by an unknown third party. On the same\n[day the wallet was emptied, with 107.8 bitcoins (then worth $5.3 million) being sent to a new](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/darkside-ransomware-has-netted-over-90-million-in-bitcoin)\nbitcoin address.\n\nThese funds remained dormant until yesterday (October 21). Beginning at 7am GMT, the\nfunds, now worth $7 million, were moved through a series of new wallets over the course of\nseveral hours, with small amounts being “peeled” off at each step. This is a common money\nlaundering technique, used to attempt to make the funds more difficult to track and to aid\ntheir conversion into fiat currency through exchanges. The process is ongoing, but small\namounts of the funds have already been sent to known exchanges.\n\n[The movement of the dormant DarkSide funds comes on the same day that it was reported](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/)\nthat the REvil ransomware group had been hacked and forced online in a government-led\n[operation. DarkSide has been strongly linked to REvil, with the ransomware groups sharing](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/what-we-know-about-darkside-ransomware-and-the-us-pipeline-attac.html)\nsimilarly structured ransom notes and using the same code.\n\nElliptic’s clients, including financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges can be alerted\nto any client deposits that originate from the DarkSide wallet, by using our transaction and\nwallet screening solutions.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis blog is provided for general informational purposes only.
