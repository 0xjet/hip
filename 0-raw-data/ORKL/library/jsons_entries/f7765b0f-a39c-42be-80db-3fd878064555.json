Industrial cybersecurity developed into a board-level topic during 2017.\n\nBut what do user companies really want? What are their priorities, and what concerns and\n\nchallenges do they face? What external and internal factors are impacting industrial\n\ncybersecurity? What strategies and measures are being employed, now and in the future?\n\nThe present trend study \"The State of Industrial Cybersecurity 2018\" seeks to answer all these\n\nquestions. It was carried out by PAC on behalf of Kaspersky Lab and analyzes the status quo and\n\nfuture developments worldwide with regard to industrial cybersecurity. It is based on a CATI\n\nsurvey of 320 worldwide professionals with decision-making power on OT/ICS cybersecurity, as\n\nwell as 12 expert interviews. This study is an annual study. The first one was carried out in 2017.\n\n\n###### “Cybersecurity is grabbing a lot of attention at every level. But to deal with\n this problem we must do more. Cyber\n threats are a harsh reality of today’s\n world, which we can’t keep on ignoring. With most of the processes\n\n\n###### being handled remotely, there is\n always a chance of breach, of someone getting ahold of these processes and causing a lot of harm.”\n\n**(Steel manufacturing, US)**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### KEY FINDINGS – TAKE-AWAYS\n\n\n\n- **Over three quarters of the companies surveyed state that OT/ICS cybersecurity is a major**\n\n**priority**\n\nBut if companies really attribute such a high level of importance to this topic, it would\n\nbe essential to carry out the associated measures in a very stringent way. This seems not\n\nto be the case in all companies.\n\n- **Over three quarters of the companies surveyed state that it is very likely or at least quite**\n\n**likely to become a target of a cybersecurity attack in the OT/ICS space**\n\nDespite this, only 23% are compliant with minimal mandatory industry or government\n\nguidance and regulations around cybersecurity of industrial control systems. On the\n\nother hand, the vast majority of the companies surveyed are increasing their OT/ICS\n\ncybersecurity investments or keeping them at least steady.\n\n- **More than half of the companies did not experience any incident or breach in the past**\n\n**12 months**\n\nAlthough this seems to be a good thing at first glance, the question is whether or not\n\nthey would even have recognized it. Many companies do not detect or even track\n\nattacks! Moreover, since the companies surveyed have only just started digital\n\ntransformation, it can be said that the attack surface will increase along with the level\n\nof digitalization.\n\n- **For most companies that experienced OT/ICS cybersecurity incidents or breaches this**\n\n**had a relevant negative impact on their bottom line**\n\nIf incidents or breaches occur, they have a strong negative impact, usually regarding\n\nthe company’s bottom line; in the worst-case scenarios, the consequences could even\n\nmean casualties.\n\n- **Low but increasing maturity**\n\nThe maturity of ICS/OT cybersecurity remains low, e.g. the way OT/ICS security is\n\norganized, but the potential impacts and liabilities make it a priority; besides, the level\n\nof maturity is quickly rising, even if it is strongly limited by the lack of skills and\n\ncollaboration.\n\n- **Collaboration between IT and OT teams is critical**\n\nCollaboration is a critical factor for cybersecurity, even more so in OT/ICS cybersecurity.\n\nIT and OT people have different goals, processes, tools, and languages, but they must\n\ncollaborate if they want to protect the OT/ICS space that is more and more blended\n\nwith the IT space.\n\n\n\n   -\n\n\n\n   -\n\n\n\n   -\n\n\n-----\n\n###### “Cybersecurity of ICS in our organization is critical,\n and we take it very seriously. Ensuring best-quality\n products is the top priority and undoubtedly a fundamental concern. Any breach into our drug manufacturing systems can lead to a wide range of\n operational disruptions – including production downtime – or may result in inefficient or poisonous drugs, spillage of hazardous materials etc. There are\n many compliance requirements we need to follow.”\n\n\n**(Pharmaceuticals, US)**\n\n\n#### CYBERSECURITY IN AN INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT: MANAGING RISKS AND COMPLIANCE ARE KEY\n\nAs digital transformation is spreading within the industrial environment, cybersecurity is becoming\n\nmore and more important across the board. This section will look at the business priorities, the\n\npriorities of OT/ICS cybersecurity, OT/ICS cybersecurity business risks and concerns, and the\n\nchallenges that lie in management of OT/ICS cybersecurity.\n\n###### “Although it appears there are incremental improvements in several\n areas of addressing OT cybersecurity risk, it is discouraging to see\n that for the most part we still lack significant progress across the board when it comes to dedicating resources to these challenges. As we increase the level of automation in our critical infrastructures,\n we MUST take security issues seriously.”\n\n (Marty Edwards, Managing Director, Automation Federation, USA)\n\n BUSINESS PRIORITIES\n\nBasically, all surveyed business priorities have become even more pronounced at most companies,\n\nas we compare the 2017 survey results with the 2018 ones. The most important ones are still the\n\nmanagement of risks, improving products/services quality, and better compliance with regulations\n\nand requirements. Especially customer-related items have seen a growth in prioritization, unlike cost\n\nreduction. In 2018, companies are not in defensive mode anymore; they want to grow, expand, and\n\nprofit from digital transformation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Which of the following initiatives will be a major, minor, or no priority for your\n organization over the next 12 months?\n\n\nMajor priority Minor priority\n\n\nManaging risks\n\nImproving our products/services quality\n\n|65%|30%|\n|---|---|\n\n|65%|28%|\n|---|---|\n\n\nBetter complying with regulations and\n\nrequirements\n\nAcquiring new customers\n\n|62%|31%|\n|---|---|\n\n\nImproving our customer experience\n\nBetter complying with our customer\n\nrequirements\n\n|61%|30%|\n|---|---|\n\n|59%|33%|\n|---|---|\n\n\nImproving our ability to innovate\n\nAccelerating digital business\n\n|59%|33%|\n|---|---|\n\n|56%|36%|\n|---|---|\n\n\nImproving our products/services\n\ndifferentiation\n\n|55%|38%|\n|---|---|\n\n\nRealizing IoT use cases and managing\n\nconnected devices\n\nReducing costs\n\n|53%|40%|\n|---|---|\n\n|64%|33%|\n|---|---|\n|62% 31% 61% 30% 59% 33% 59% 33% 56% 36% 55% 38% 53% 40% 49% 41%||\n|49%||\n\n\nn = 320 (\"No priority at all\" not shown)\n\n###### PRIORITY OF OT/ICS CYBERSECURITY \n\n\nWhen it comes to prioritization of OT/ICS cybersecurity, we see that the vast majority of the\n\ncompanies see it as major priority. The risks are understood and therefore the ground for actions is\n\nlaid out.\n\n\n###### What level of priority is given to OT/ICS cybersecurity in your organization?\n\n\n# 77%\n\n###### of the companies surveyed rank cybersecurity as a major priority.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OT/ICS CYBERSECURITY BUSINESS RISKS AND CONCERNS\n\n\nLooking at cybersecurity business risks and concerns in the OT/ICS space,\n\nwe see that awareness levels have risen strongly. While in the 2017 survey,\n\nabout one third of companies attributed concerns to the different items, in\n\n2018 it is about two thirds attributing major concerns and almost one third\n\nattributing minor concerns.\n\n\n###### “ICS cybersecurity is\n attributed a lot of importance at all levels.\n\n\n###### But I would agree that\n\n\nThe top concerns are damage to the products/services and injury or death\n\nof employees. Most companies also see a link between cyber damage and\n\nbusiness success on different levels: an adverse effect on quality is directly\n\nlinked to the loss of customer confidence, while the loss of business sensitive\n\ninformation is associated with a loss of contracts or business opportunities.\n\nIn addition, most companies have concerns over a violation of regulations.\n\n\n###### there has been an awareness issue at lower\n levels because people\n\n\n###### there are not so much aware of the impact of a breach or cyber-attack.”\n\n**(Energy and utility, US)**\n\n\n###### Which of the following aspects will be a major, minor, or no concern for your\n company in case of an ICS cybersecurity incident/breach?\n\n\nMajor concern Minor concern\n\nDamage to the products/services quality **69%**\n\n\nInjury or death of employees\n\nLoss of customer confidence\n\nDamage to company brand or reputation\n\n\nLoss of proprietary or confidential information\n\nViolation of regulatory requirements\n\n\nLoss of contracts or business opportunities\n\nEnvironmental damage\n\n\nInjury or death of non-employees / local\n\nresidents\n\nImpact on national security\n\n\nCriminal or civil legal liabilities\n\nReduction or loss of production at one site or\n\nmultiple sites simultaneously\n\n\nCost of incident response and mitigation\n\nRelease, diversion, or theft of hazardous\n\nmaterials\n\n|49%|37%|\n|---|---|\n\n\nDamage to equipment\n\nPenalties/sanctions for not fulfilling\n\ncommercial obligations\n\n|69%|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|26%|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||\n|64%||||30%||\n|||||||\n|63%||||30%||\n|||||||\n|62%||||31%||\n|||||||\n|62%||||30%||\n|||||||\n|62%||||29%||\n|||||||\n|61%||||31%||\n|||||||\n|60%||||30%||\n|||||||\n|59%||||31%||\n|57% 33% 55% 35%||||||\n|54%|||38%|||\n|||||||\n|51%||41%||||\n|49% 37%||||||\n|47%|48%|||||\n|47% 42%||||||\n|47%||||||\n\n\nn = 320 (\"No concern\" not shown)\n\nWe can see that awareness of many items has risen considerably. Most of the items are now seen\n\n\nas a major concern by the majority of companies.\n\nWhen comparing IT security and OT/ICS cybersecurity, a key aspect is that in the former damage is\n\nmostly confined to the IT space, thus remaining largely virtual, while in the OT/ICS space it could\n\nalso be physical. This has a totally different impact on risk mitigation and on the liabilities enterprises\n\n\ncould face.\n\nTo evaluate the actions needed in terms of cybersecurity in the OT/ICS space, it is not only important\n\n\nto know the concerns and the associated potential damage, but also the likelihood of an attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### How likely is your organization to become a target of a cybersecurity incident\n involving the ICS or industrial control network?\n\n\n###### 2017 2018\n\n**49%** **45%**\n\nVery likely Quite likely Not likely Not very likely\n\n\n###### “There are a lot of changes right now.

While 35% of Russian companies do not see themselves as targets and only\n\n13% think it very likely that they will become a target, companies from the Middle East are much\n\nmore alarmed – there, 63% of companies consider it very likely that they will become the target of\n\na cyber-attack. This attitude does not come as a surprise since industrial companies in the Middle\n\nEast have been victims of targeted ICS attacks in recent years, including the recent Triton case. This\n\ncan also be seen as an indicator of market maturity, which is pretty low in Russia at the moment.\n\n\nEven in the area of OT/ICS cybersecurity, traditional cyber threats are a major concern for the\n\nmajority of the companies surveyed. 66% of the companies state that targeted attacks and APTs\n\nare a major concern – this is understandable given that in 2017 there were new rumors of cyber\nphysical attacks, including Triton and Industroyer. For conventional malware/virus outbreaks, this\n\nfigure is 65%, while for ransomware attacks it is 64%. In 2017, there were lots of ransomware\n\noutbreaks, including cases inside industrial environments, which explains the high level of consensus\n\nregarding these as major concerns.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Which of the following security incidents are a major, minor, or no concern for\n your OT/ICS systems or industrial control network?

This aspect is even more critical given that\n\ncompanies need to integrate their OT/ICS with their IT systems\n\nand IoT ecosystems, meaning they are opening up these systems\n\nto the outside (non-internal ICS/OT) world.\n\n\n###### “First of all, a company has to set up some kind\n of security framework.\n\n\n###### There are a lot of resources with IT skills, but they don’t have any\n experience in terms of\n\n\nAnother major challenge for 50% of the companies surveyed is\n\nfinding suitable partners and service providers to implement ICS\n\nsolutions.

In\n\n2017, this result was at a similarly low level, so we see no real\n\nimprovement in this area.\n\nCompliance with voluntary industry or government guidance or\n\nregulations has seen a strong decline compared to last year, for\n\nwhich there are three reasons:\n\n\n###### Only\n# 23%\n\n###### of the companies surveyed state that they are compliant with mandatory industry or governmental guidance or regulations.\n\n\n1. Mandatory cybersecurity regulations such as the NIS Directive are given priority, and as\n\nthey are expensive to implement, they are eating up all the budget and time of the\n\ncompanies surveyed.\n\n2. In times of internal and external skills shortages, voluntary tasks are the first to be skipped.\n\n3. A lot of guidance and regulations evolve quickly and as such are difficult to follow in full,\n\ni.e. being compliant in 2017 does not necessarily mean being so in 2018 as well; no resources\n\nare available for additional actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Does your organization comply with any industry or government guidance/regulations around cybersecurity of OT/ICSs?

The major\n\nvectors are:\n\n\n###### “As a middleman, I need to\n report to the IT, ICS, and\n\n\n###### specifically the cybersecurity department,\n which is included in our\n\n\n\n- the focus on OT/ICS\n\n- production intensity\n\n- outsourcing culture.\n\n\n###### internal IT.”\n\n**(Metal processing, Russia)**\n\n\nThe survey clearly highlights a trend that ICS organizations tend to keep management of their OT/ICS\n\ncybersecurity internally, with only 8% of the companies fully outsourcing this function currently.\n\nCompanies loathe to outsource the cybersecurity of those core parts of their value chain, and\n\nfurthermore, there are still too few outsourcing providers that are capable of assuming this type of\n\nworkload.\n\n\n###### “There are a lot of threats in the industry today; every\n few months we hear about instances of hacking, data theft, or a cyber-attack on some plant. This topic should be prioritized at management level and\n\n\n###### all other levels informed accordingly.”\n\n**(Oil and gas industry, UAE)**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### How is the responsibility for OT/ICS security organized in your company?\n\n\n###### One or more employees – from our dedicated IT\n security team – take care of our OT/ICS in\n addition to their main responsibility.\n\n We have our own OT/ICS security team, whose\n members exclusively take care of OT/ICS\n security.\n\n\n###### 39%\n\n\n###### 29%\n\n\n###### One or more external service providers take care of our OT/ICS security, but we have an OT/ICS security manager to coordinate this.\n\n One or more external service providers fully take care of our OT/ICS security.

Therefore, at 69% of the companies surveyed, operational technology/engineering is\n\nstrongly involved in OT/ICS cybersecurity, while at 53% of companies, OT/ICS cybersecurity is\n\nrepresented and supported by board or C-suite level members. Also, the system integrators who\n\nbuilt the systems (48%) as well as the teams who are in charge of facility, maintenance, and property\n\nmanagement (40%) are strongly involved. All these stakeholders are crucial in order to have all\n\n\ninformation and planning on the\n\ntable so that OT/ICS\n\ncybersecurity is performed\n\ncorrectly. Collaboration is a key\n\ncatalyst of cybersecurity, and\n\neven more so for ICS/OT\n\ncybersecurity.\n\n\n###### “We have installed a special department for cybersecurity as it is a growing concern for us.

Even though these technologies are a given in\n\ntraditional IT cybersecurity, in OT/ICS cybersecurity they are less\n\noften in use.\n\nFor example, network monitoring and log analysis – a given in\n\n\n###### “We mainly focus on perimeter security. No vulnerability management involved. We will continue\n to focus on network protection in most cases.”\n\n**(Metal processing, Russia)**\n\n\n###### “It is important to implement an air gap security measure as it ensures that the data is going from one side and restricts the other parties\n in use of the data.”\n\n**(Oil and gas industry, UAE)**\n\n\ntraditional IT security – is implemented for OT/ICS purposes at only 56% of the companies surveyed.\n\nThe same is true for network segmentation (47% of companies) or intrusion detection (45%). These\n\npoints are the foundation of any viable OT/ICS protection. Air gapping is a must-have. The basic\n\nidea is that there is no connection between OT/ICS networks and the traditional IT networks or the\n\nInternet. 34% of the companies surveyed state that they have implemented air gapping; 39% are\n\nplanning implementation within the next 12 months. The low level of maturity is worrying.\n\nIn addition, the majority of companies are implementing IoT and Industry 4.0. However, a\n\nconnection to the OT/ICS systems is needed for these technologies to be effective.\n\n**Vulnerability scanning**\n\nVulnerability scanning is a fundamental task to make sure systems and applications are up to date\n\nand known problems are fixed. Obviously, vulnerability scans should be continuously performed or\n\nat least be done with every vulnerability database update. Another example of the lack of maturity\n\nin OT/ICS cybersecurity is that most of such scans are targeted only at traditional IT components\n\n(like OS for SCADA), not for specific ICS components.\n\nMost of the respondents using vulnerability scanning use it regularly, i.e. every week (46%) or every\n\n2 weeks (26%). The remaining 28% did not understand the concept.\n\n**Process-oriented measures**\n\nSecurity awareness training for staff, contractors, and vendors with access to control systems and\n\nnetworks are widely implemented (82% of the companies surveyed). Security assessments and audits\n\nof control systems and their networks, including penetration tests, are also important but less often\n\nimplemented. Only 60% of companies have such assessments and audits implemented, but at least\n\n35% of the companies surveyed are planning to implement such measures in the next 12 months. As\n\nin most IT segments, training and certifications for current staff responsible for implementing or\n\nmaintaining the security of control systems and networks are implemented at only 46% o f the\n\ncompanies surveyed; 40% of companies plan to do so in the next 12 months.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Does your organization have any of the following process-oriented measures already implemented, is it planned within the next 12 months, is it of interest but\n still in discussion, or is it not relevant?\n\n\n###### Implemented Plan to implement in the next 12 months Interested, but still in discussion\n\n Security awareness training for\n\n\n###### staff, contractors and vendors with access to control systems\n and networks\n\n\n# 82%\n\n###### of the companies surveyed state that they have implemented security awareness training, but only\n# 46%\n\n###### have training and certification programs implemented for current staff implementing and maintaining the security of control systems and networks!\n\n\n###### Patching programs\n\n Security assessment/audit of\n\n\n###### 3%\n\n 5%\n\n|63%|25%|9%|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n###### control systems and control system networks / penetration\n testing\n\n\n###### Training and certification for\n current staff responsible for implementing / maintaining the\n\n\n###### 14%\n\n\n###### security of control systems and\n\n\n###### networks\n\nn = 320 (\"Not relev ant\" not shown\n\nPatching programs are an easy way of securing systems but are limited by the production issues\n\nof OT/ICS systems. Patching can alter the way OT/ICS systems work, explaining the low level of\n\nimplementation of this fairly effective cybersecurity process. While 63% of the companies\n\nsurveyed have such programs in place and an additional 25% are planning to implement such\n\nprograms in the next 12 months, at least some parts of the IT industry are talking about evergreen\n\nin order to ensure that systems are always up to date and secure. In addition, nearly half of the\n\ncompanies regard Industry 4.0 as very important.
