NCCIC is a division of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity’s (DHS) Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&C). ICS-CERT’s Vulnerability team\nsupports cybersecurity efforts across the industrial controls systems (ICS) community by working with its\npartners to identify, validate, mitigate, and disclose ICS vulnerabilities. The information in this report provides\ninsight into vulnerability trends in 2016 and enhances visibility into ICS-CERT’s coordination efforts.\n\nICS-CERT received 2,282 reported vulnerabilities in FY 2016, which resulted in the release of 157\nadvisories and 17 alerts. In CY 2016, ICS-CERT received 2,328 reported vulnerabilities, which resulted in\nthe release of 185 advisories and 17 alerts. ICS-CERT analyzed a subset of the total number of vulnerabilities\nreported in FY and CY 2016 and determined that the average Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nscore for reported vulnerabilities was 7.8/10 and that the four most frequently occurring vulnerabilities\ntypes were Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Input Validation, Cross-site Scripting, and Heap-based\nBuffer Overflow vulnerabilities. In FY and CY 2016, ICS-CERT coordination with product vendors resulted\nin product fixes for 92.1 percent and 89.3 percent of reported vulnerabilities, respectively. The majority\nof the vulnerabilities coordinated by ICS-CERT in 2016 were most commonly associated with the Energy,\nCritical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, and Water and Wastewater Systems Sectors.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1. SCOPE\n\nThis report provides a summary of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) National Cybersecurity\nand Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) / Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response\nTeam (ICS-CERT) vulnerability coordination efforts performed during Fiscal Year (FY) and Calendar Year\n(CY) 2016. These coordination efforts apply to all of the 16 critical infrastructure (CI) sectors, as identified\nin Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21).\n\nICS-CERT stood up the Vulnerability Coordination team in response to a recognized need for a single\nresource to collect, coordinate, and provide vulnerability information to the industrial controls systems\n(ICS) community. The primary objective of ICS-CERT’s vulnerability coordination work is to help mitigate\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities quickly to reduce the likelihood of a successful cyber attack against the Nation’s\nCI. Vulnerability coordination requires technical expertise, documentation, and close trusted partnerships\nwith key ICS community stakeholders, including vendors; manufacturers; integrators; CI owners;\nresearchers; federal, state, and local government organizations; and international partners.\n\n\nCI. Vulnerability coordination requires technical expertise, documentation, and close trusted partnerships\nwith key ICS community stakeholders, including vendors; manufacturers; integrators; CI owners;\nresearchers; federal, state, and local government organizations; and international partners.\n\n### 2. ICS-CERT VULNERABILITY\n\n COORDINATION PROCESS\n\nICS-CERT manages the vulnerability coordination process in five phases:\n\n###### 1. Vulnerability Identification: ICS-CERT typically obtains vulnerability information from security\n\nresearchers and product vendors and by monitoring public sources of vulnerability information. Once\nICS-CERT identifies a vulnerability, ICS-CERT reviews it and creates a vulnerability ticket.\n###### 2. Vendor Notification and Validation: ICS-CERT passes the identified vulnerability to the respon­\n\nsible vendor to validate it and to start the coordination process.\n###### 3. Vulnerability Mitigation: Following the validation of an identified vulnerability, ICS-CERT\n\nprovides recommendations and offers assistance while the affected vendor develops and implements a\nmitigation plan.\n###### 4. Disclosure: In coordination with the reporting researcher and the product vendor, ICS-CERT\n\nreleases an information product to notify asset owners and operators about the identified vulnerability\nand the proposed mitigations. If the vendor needs additional time to communicate with its customers\nabout product fixes, all involved parties negotiate a patch window. The patch window includes the\ninitial release of a portal advisory to the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) portal for a\npredetermined length of time, prior to its public release.\n###### 5. Finalization: Following the publication of the ICS-CERT information product, the vulnerability\n\nteam adds any final details to the vulnerability ticket and closes it out.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3. VULNERABILITY METRICS\n\n REPORTING CHANGES \n\nThe method used to collect and report vulnerability data changed in 2016 from that used in prior years. In\n2016, ICS-CERT began reporting metrics data on vulnerability tickets closed within the FY or CY accounting\nperiods. This prevents reported metrics changing based on work accomplished throughout the life of\nan open ticket. In previous year’s reporting methods, actions taken prior to ticket closure could result in\nadditional follow-on work being required, which in turn could change the reported metrics. It is therefore\nimportant to note that some information reported in published alerts and advisories in 2016 may not be\nincluded in the FY or CY data cited herein, since the associated vulnerability ticket may still be open. Data\nfor tickets will be included in the reporting period in which the ticket is closed.\n\n\nperiods. This prevents reported metrics changing based on work accomplished throughout the life of\nan open ticket. In previous year’s reporting methods, actions taken prior to ticket closure could result in\nadditional follow-on work being required, which in turn could change the reported metrics. It is therefore\nimportant to note that some information reported in published alerts and advisories in 2016 may not be\nincluded in the FY or CY data cited herein, since the associated vulnerability ticket may still be open. Data\nfor tickets will be included in the reporting period in which the ticket is closed.\n\nICS-CERT provides historical data in this document for the reader’s use; however, due to the data collection\nand reporting changes in 2016, the reader should be cautious in comparing metrics from 2016 with\nmetrics from prior years.\n\n### 4. INFORMATION PRODUCTS RELEASED\n\nICS-CERT releases alerts and advisories to notify the ICS community about vulnerabilities that threaten\nthe Nation’s CI. Alerts and advisories provide actionable information about known vulnerabilities, threats,\nand mitigations. This information helps asset owners and operators understand how attackers might\ncompromise their ICS and how to take action to protect their ICS.\n\nICS-CERT alerts provide timely notification to CI owners and operators about publicly known threats that\nhave the potential to affect ICS. ICS-CERT typically releases alerts soon after the identification of publicly\navailable vulnerability information or exploits. Alerts also provide baseline mitigations to reduce the risk of\nexploitation.\n\nICS-CERT advisories provide information about security vulnerabilities in products used in CI and typically\ncontain vendor recommended mitigations or compensating controls.\n\n\n-----\n\nnumbers for alerts and advisories since FY 2010. The graphic does not include calendar year data for\nyears prior to 2016. Because of the change in reporting metrics in 2016, readers should use caution in\ncomparing prior data with that of 2016.\n\nAdvisories\n\nAlerts released\nYear Alerts Advisories released to\nto HSIN portal\n\nHSIN portal[1]\n\n###### FY 2016 17 5 157 17 CY 2016 17 5 185 14\n\n Table 1.

OPENED AND CLOSED TICKETS\n\nWhen ICS-CERT receives a vulnerability report, the Vulnerability team opens (creates) a ticket to track the\nvulnerabilities associated with the received report. Tickets include information that describes the problem,\ntracks progress on active steps, maintains contact information, and annotates activities performed for closure.\n\nTable 2 shows the total number of tickets opened and the total number of tickets closed during FY and\nCY 2016.\n\n|16.|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Year|Tickets Opened|Tickets Closed|\n|FY 2016|186|143|\n|CY 2016|255|162|\n\n\nYear Tickets Opened Tickets Closed\n###### FY 2016 186 143 CY 2016 255 162\n\n Table 2. Vulnerability tickets opened and closed during FY and CY 2016.\n\nFigure 2 shows historical numbers of opened and closed tickets since FY 2010. The graphic does not\ninclude calendar year data for years prior to 2016. The slight color differences in Figure 2 for 2016 opened\nand closed tickets merely reminds the reader of the reporting process change in 2016.\n\n###### Figure 2.

REPORTED AND COORDINATED\n\n VULNERABILITIES\n\nIn FY 2016, ICS-CERT coordinated 2,272 vulnerabilities. This number is significantly greater than the\nnumber of vulnerabilities reported in prior years. The dramatic increase is primarily due to two vulnerability\nreports containing hundreds of vulnerabilities, identified by using automated scanning tools.[2] The scanning\ntools expedite the detection process and make it easier to detect out-of-date third-party software.\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the total number of vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT prior to FY 2016, as well as the\nnumber of vulnerabilities coordinated by ICS-CERT in FY and CY 2016. The graphic does not include\ncalendar year data for years prior to 2016. With the metrics reporting change in 2016 to using closed\ntickets, ICS-CERT advises caution when comparing data from FY 2016 with data from prior years.\n\n###### Figure 3. Vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT since FY 2010.FY 2010: 37;\r\nFY 2011: 209;\r\nFY 2012: 203; \r\nFY 2013: 190; \r\nFY 2014: 245; \r\nFY 2015: 427; \r\nFY 2016: 390; \r\nCY 2016: 431; \r\nFY 2016 including 2-ticket anomaly: 2272; \r\nCY 2016 including 2-ticket anomaly: 2317.\n\nTo help provide more granularity to the FY and CY 2016 data, Table 3 breaks down the total number of\nvulnerabilities coordinated. Out of the 2,282 reported vulnerabilities that ICS-CERT coordinated in FY 2016,\nthe responsible product vendors refuted 10 vulnerabilities, resulting in 2,272 validated vulnerabilities.\nExcluding the 10 refuted vulnerabilities and the 1,878 outlier vulnerabilities, ICS-CERT performed data\nanalysis on 394 validated vulnerabilities. Of these 394 validated vulnerabilities, ICS-CERT did not assign a\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score to four vulnerabilities.\n\n2 The increase is primarily associated with two (2) tickets closed in 2016 that contain 1,418 and 460 vulnerabilities. Because\nthese 1,878 validated vulnerabilities were associated with a small subset of affected products, there is some concern that\nthese outliers could bias the metrics associated with vulnerability type and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nscores. As a result, these are included in the total number of vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT; however, this data is not\nincluded in other metrics treated throughout this document.\n\n\n-----\n\n2,317 validated vulnerabilities. Excluding the 11 refuted vulnerabilities and the 1,878 outlier vulnerabilities\npreviously mentioned, ICS-CERT performed data analysis on 439 vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT did not assign\nCVSS scores to eight of these 439 validated vulnerabilities. All vulnerability data for 2016 derives from\nvulnerabilities associated with vulnerability tickets closed during the specified reporting period.

VULNERABILITY TYPES AND SCORING\n\nICS-CERT categorizes and assesses the impact of validated vulnerabilities by assigning Common Weakness\nEnumeration (CWE) numbers and CVSS scores. In the following subsections, we provide the metrics\nassociated with CWE and CVSS score assignments for validated vulnerabilities closed in CY and FY 2016.\n\n###### 7.1 Vulnerability Types\n\nIn FY 2016, ICS-CERT categorized and assigned 70 CWE numbers to 394 validated vulnerabilities. The four\nmost frequently occurring CWEs were CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow; CWE-20: Improper Input\nValidation; CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting; and CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow.\n\n\nmost frequently occurring CWEs were CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow; CWE-20: Improper Input\nValidation; CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting; and CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow.\n\nIn CY 2016, ICS-CERT categorized and assigned 85 CWE numbers to 439 validated vulnerabilities. The four\nmost frequently occurring CWEs were CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow; CWE-122: Heap-based\nBuffer Overflow; CWE-20: Improper Input Validation; and CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting.\n\nFigure 5 shows the most frequently assigned CWEs in FY and CY 2016. Each series shows the most frequent\nCWE assignments for 70 percent of all validated vulnerabilities during that reporting period.\n\n###### Figure 5.

In CY 2016, ICS-CERT assigned\nCVSS scores to 431 validated vulnerabilities. The average CVSS score for the vulnerabilities assessed by\nICS-CERT was 7.8 out of 10. In FY and CY 2016, 71 and 73.8 percent of the vulnerabilities, respectively,\nhave CVSS scores of seven and above. A CVSS score of seven or above indicates that these vulnerabilities, if\nexploited, have the potential to have a high or critical impact. Table 4 shows the distribution of the CVSS\nscores and general statistics about the scoring.\n\nTotal Score Score CVSS Statistics\n\nScore 7–8.9 Score 0 3.9\n\nYear Vulnerabilities 9.0–10.0 4–6.9 (Average, Median,\n\n(High) (Low)\n\nAssigned CVSS (Critical) (Medium) Hi-Low)\n\n###### Average: 7.8  Median: 7.5 \n FY 16 390 158 119 104 9\n Maximum: 10.0 \n Minimum: 2.2\n Average: 7.8  Median: 7.5 \n CY 16 431 155 163 102 11\n Maximum: 10.0 \n Minimum: 2.3\n\n Table 4. CVSS scores and statistics for FY and CY 2016.\n\nOne of the more significant parameters associated with CVSS scores is Attack Vector, based on accessibility.\nThis parameter gives some indication of the degree to which a vulnerability is exploitable. Of the 390\nvulnerabilities assigned a CVSS score in FY 2016, 356 (91 percent) have an access vector of “Remote.”\n\n###### Figure 6.

VULNERABILITY RESOLUTION\n\nICS-CERT typically recommends that vendors produce product fixes for identified vulnerabilities.\nHowever, in some cases, it may not be possible for a vendor to offer a fix for unsupported products. In\nthese situations, ICS-CERT works with the vendor to identify compensating controls to limit the risk of\nexploitation of an identified vulnerability.\n\nMany of the researchers that ICS-CERT works with use tools and techniques that are not readily available to\nsome vendors. Therefore, during the vulnerability coordination process, ICS-CERT recommends that vendors\nprovide copies of their product fixes to the researchers who identified the associated vulnerabilities so they\ncan validate the fix by using the same technique(s) they used to find the vulnerability originally.\n\n|Year|Validated Vulnerabilities|Fixes Provided by Product Vendors|Fixes Researchers Validated|Fixes Without Validation|Fixes Not Provided|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|FY16|394|363|54|309|31|\n|CY16|439|392|55|337|47|\n\n\nIn an attempt to capture vendor responsiveness to addressing reported vulnerabilities, ICS-CERT details the\nnumber of vulnerabilities for which product vendors have provided product fixes, as well as the number of\nresearcher-validated fixes. Table 6 provides the FY an CY 2016 data for closed tickets.\n\nFixes\n\nValidated Fixes Provided by Fixes Without Fixes Not\nYear Researchers\nVulnerabilities Product Vendors Validation Provided\n\nValidated\n\n###### FY16 394 363 54 309 31 CY16 439 392 55 337 47\n\n Table 6.

ICS-CERT\nobserved an increase in the number of product vendors self-reporting vulnerabilities, which is a strong\nindicator of a mature or maturing security culture within an organization. To better understand and track\nthis trend, ICS-CERT has broken down all of the validated vulnerabilities by reporting source for FY and\nCY 2016 in Table 7.

SUMMARY\n\nIn FY and CY 2016, ICS-CERT released 157 and 185 advisories, respectively, and 17 alerts during both\nreporting periods. The number of vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT in FY and CY 2016 were 2,282\nand 2,328 vulnerabilities, respectively. The Vulnerability team performed a more detailed analysis on a\nsubset of the reported vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity researchers reported 98.6 percent of the vulnerabilities\nreported to ICS-CERT and product vendors self-reported the remaining 1.4 percent. The most frequently\noccurring vulnerability types encountered by ICS-CERT were Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Input\nValidation, Cross-site Scripting, and Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities.
