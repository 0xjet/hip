There are\nvarious types of campaigns attributed to Lazarus, based on toolset similarities, shared infrastructure, telemetry, or the cui\nbono principle, and we have been discovering many of these campaigns for years. In this paper we will discuss the group’s\nrecent attacks, or attempts, from the years 2022 and 2023, several of which have not previously been publicly disclosed.\nThese include: decoy programming challenges against a Spanish aerospace company delivering a highly sophisticated\nRAT; Coinbase‑themed decoys with both Windows and macOS payloads targeting individuals in South America; attempts\nto compromise banking entities in the United States and Tanzania via fake Signature Bank- and MUFG-themed job offers;\nan OpenSSL-based backdoor discovered in an agriculture-related entity in South Korea; a lure designed for Linux desktop\nusers, submitted to VirusTotal from Georgia and related to the recent 3CX supply-chain attack, and more.\n\nIn our study we will outline the relationship between recent Lazarus campaigns and their payloads delivered onto targeted\nsystems. Usually there are many tools deployed in chains by these attackers: in the initial stages, various droppers, loaders,\nand simple downloaders are used to establish a stable foothold in the system, while in the later stages, full-featured RATs\nand more complex downloaders are involved. We will focus on these payloads, which are usually more sophisticated and\nharder to acquire. We dive deep into the attackers’ custom implementation of the client-server model – the method of\nparsing server commands and the multi-step network authentication – as understanding and identification of these aspects\nmay boost confidence in the attribution verdict.\n\nFinally, we will note the diverse geographical distribution of the group’s recent campaigns, and the fact that Lazarus\noperators have prepared native payloads to cover all the major platforms: Windows, Linux and macOS.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nThe Lazarus group (also known as HIDDEN COBRA) is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. It is\nresponsible for high-profile incidents such as the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and tens-of-millions-of-dollar cyber\nheists in 2016, the WannaCryptor (aka WannaCry) outbreak in 2017, and a long history of disruptive attacks against South\nKorean public and critical infrastructure since at least 2011. The diversity, number and eccentricity in implementation of\nLazarus campaigns define this group, alongside the fact that it performs all three pillars of cybercriminal activities: cyber\nespionage, cyber sabotage, and pursuit of financial gain.\n\nIn 2021, the US Department of Justice indicted North Korean citizens in connection with cyber-enabled financial (and\ncryptocurrency) crimes spread across 2014–2020 [1]. The North Korean regime itself considers cyberwarfare as an\n‘all-purpose sword’ that guarantees relentless offensive capabilities [2].\n\nThe North Korean regime is reportedly involved in illicit economic activities. There is a study published by the Committee\nfor Human Rights in North Korea on the country’s criminal behaviour, including trade in amphetamine-type stimulants,\nproduction and distribution of high-quality counterfeit currency, trafficking in endangered species, and the manufacture of\ncounterfeit cigarettes [3], [4]. Moreover, North Korea seems to orchestrate forced labour of its migrant workers on a global\nscale [5].\n\nDespite the severe United Nations sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, the country still enjoys access to defence\nmarkets, and is involved in the sale of indigenous arms, materiel, and services to various state and non-state actors [6]. The\nUS Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), an intelligence agency under the Department of Defense, published an unclassified\nreport on North Korea’s defence and military strategy and tactics in 2021 [7]. It sheds some light on North Korea’s nuclear\nweapons program, and missile development and testing, including of road-mobile short-range (SRBM), medium-range\n(MRBM), intercontinental (ICBM), and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), both liquid- and solid-propelled.\n\nWhen performing attribution, we don’t have the intelligence means to identify the perpetrator of a cyber attack and that’s\nnot our aim either. To build a theory on Lazarus activity, our goal is to classify the group’s new cyber attacks as\nsignificantly similar with those already attributed, using strong indicators expressed in terms of the malware toolset used,\nshared network infrastructure, and telemetry [8]. Additionally, we try to cluster various activity subtypes if we see\nborderlines between them. We provide the results of these efforts in the ‘Campaigns’ section. After recording many Lazarus\nattacks, we dare to say that their cyber activity reflects the North Korean state’s motivations in the physical world, mostly\ndue to the targeting of aerospace and defence sectors, and pursuing financial and cryptocurrency gain.\n\nIn [9] we summarized various aspects connected with the Lazarus group: the most notorious cases from the 2014-2018\nperiod, the major toolset characteristics, and six previously unreported, Lazarus-linked cases that happened in the time\nframe of 2016-2018. Since then, the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures have evolved significantly. The ‘TTPs’\nsection in this paper summarizes various patterns that we extracted from the attacks: trojanizing of open-source projects\nlike plug-ins for Notepad++ or PDF viewers, the use of valid code-signing certificates, the Rich Headers analysis of the\ndevelopment environment that produces their payloads, and an overview of encryption present in their malware.\n\nThe group’s toolset has been developed constantly. In the ‘Backdoors’ section, we provide a catalogue of the most common\npre-final payloads deployed by the attackers. Notable is the use of strongly encrypted, HTTP(S)-based network protocols\nfor client-server communication by their downloaders and full-featured RATs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CAMPAIGNS**\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, Lazarus is active globally, to the point where the targeted companies and individuals come\nfrom all over the world; see Figure 1 in which the turquoise colour represents countries with targets, light for\ngeographically larger countries and dark for smaller ones (victims of the widespread supply-chain attacks are excluded).\n\n_Figure 1: Targets recorded by ESET telemetry and VirusTotal submissions since 2020 are all over the globe._\n\n**Regular social engineering campaigns**\n\nThere are known cases of Lazarus operators exploiting unknown vulnerabilities to gain initial access to their targets’\nnetworks [10]. However, in the majority of attacks they rely on compromising targeted systems via unsuspecting users and\nemployees. This is typically achieved through a convincing story masquerading as an attractive but bogus job offer,\nimportant news from the crypto world, or a lucrative investment agreement, and delivered in varying forms, such as\nmalicious Word documents, ZIP archives, optical disc images (ISO), and virtual hard disks (VHD).\n\n**_Operation In(ter)ception_**\n\nThe initial report on this operation was published by ESET in June 2020 [11], but summarized attacks that had happened\nsince September 2019. The initial compromise was established by luring the target with fictitious job offers from HR\nmanagers of leading organizations in aerospace and defence, such as Collins Aerospace and General Dynamics, followed\nby sending malicious files directly via LinkedIn messaging, or via a OneDrive link in an email.\n\n**Country** **Theme** **Industry** **C&C domain** **Payloads**\n\n2022-01 Turkey BAE Systems `lm-career[.]com` In(ter)ception downloaders\n2022-01 Italy Lockheed Martin Pharmaceutical markettrendingcenter[.]com In(ter)ception backdoor\n2022-01 Spain, India, Slovenia* Lockheed Martin `markettrendingcenter[.]com`\n```\n                               shopapppro[.]com\n                               techdesignshop[.]com\n\n```\n2022-02 Ukraine BAE Systems Defence In(ter)ception backdoor\n```\n                               designautocad[.]org\n                               shopwebstudio[.]com\n                               topnewsagent[.]com\n\n```\n`designlabshop[.]com` In(ter)ception backdoor,\n\n2022-03 Turkey Northrop Grumman Defence\n\n`dailynewsagent[.]com` BackbitingTea\n```\n                               freewaremail[.]com\n\n```\n2022-03 Brazil* Solana `webhosttech[.]org`\n2022-07 Argentina, Brazil Coinbase Cryptotrading `concrecapital[.]com` In(ter)ception downloaders\n2022-10 Vietnam* Crypto.com\n\nIn(ter)ception downloader\n```\n                               cloudfly[.]org\n```\n2022-12 USA Finance\n`timecashlive[.]com` BackbitingTea\n\n_Table 1: Operation In(ter)ception summary.

When the primary goal\nwas successfully completed, the attackers additionally tried to monetize the network access through business email\ncompromise [12]. Table 1 summarizes Operation In(ter)ception attacks, as observed by ESET telemetry and in VirusTotal\nsubmissions since 2022.\n\n**_DangerousPassword campaigns_**\n\nThe name of these attacks was coined by ThreatBook in a November 2019 report [13], based on a malicious LNK\ndownloader that was delivered to the target, containing a password that was required to unlock a malicious document with\ncontent of interest. The inception of the attacks goes back even further, as shown in a report by JPCERT/CC from July\n2019 [14]. Since then, many blog and Twitter posts have discussed these campaigns, e.g. by Kaspersky, which denotes\nthem as the BlueNoroff cluster of activity [15].\n\nThe typical trait of this activity is the use of various non-native file formats at the initial stages of the attack: LNK files,\nVBScripts, PowerShell, or JavaScript. In later stages, the attacker typically deploys native payloads like the WebbyTea\ndownloader and the BackbitingTea RAT (also called SnatchCrypto).\n\nAs the majority of the targets are from the financial sector and the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology,\nwe conclude that the main goal is the theft of financial and crypto assets. See Table 2, which shows a summary of\nDangerousPassword attacks as observed by ESET telemetry and in VirusTotal submissions since 2022. The theme contains\neither a filename of the lure or a lucrative brand that the attackers falsely represented to attract the target.\n\n**Country** **Theme** **Industry** **C&C domain** **Payloads**\n\nUnited\n2022-02 New Salary Adjustments `datacentre[.]center`\nKingdom*\n\nзарплата_2022020708129312\n2022-02 Ukraine* `shopapppro[.]com`\n(translation: salary)\n\nDigital\n2022-02 Ukraine JP Morgan Chase `datacentre[.]center`\ninvestment\n\nPensja Adiustacja 202202101019\n2022-02 Poland Defence `shopapppro[.]com`\n(translation: Salary Adjustment)\n\nLettre de veille international\nGICAN n°37 – février 2022\n\n2022-02 France (translation: International watch Defence `shopapppro[.]com`\n\nletter GICAN n°37 - February\n2022)\n\n2022-02 Georgia* Digital Asset Fund (DACM) `doc.filesaves[.]cloud`\n\n`word.azure-company[.]` WebbyTea,\n2022-03 Canada Finance\n`net` BackbitingTea\n\n2022-07 Israel New Salary Adjustment Blockchain `www.googlesheet[.]info`\n\n2022-07 India* Ledger Nano S&X `dps.shconstmarket[.]com`\n\nBackbitingTea,\n2022-09 Latvia Blockchain `docs.azurehosting[.]co`\nSecondHandTea\n```\n                                  verify.azure-protect[.]\n\n```\n2022-09 Tanzania MUFG Finance\n```\n                                  online\n\n```\n2022-12 Poland Signature Bank Finance `doc.gdocshare[.]one` BackbitingTea\n\nDocuSign – Executed Version `cloud.mekongcapital[.]`\n2023-02 Netherlands Cryptotrading SecondHandTea\n(Secured) `net`\n\nPDF Reader for Winforms +\n\nUnited Arab\n2023-02 DOJ Report on Bizlato `safe.doc-share[.]cloud` WebbyTea\nEmirates*\n\nInvestigation\n\nInternal PDF viewer for macOS\n\nUnited RustBucket for\n2023-05 3.0 + Jump Crypto Investment `cryptyk.ddns[.]net`\nStates* macOS [16]\n\nAgreement\n\n_Table 2: Summary of DangerousPassword attacks since 2022.

But the very first signs of\nthem can be traced back to January 2019 [18]. Since then, many additional cases have been reported publicly: [19], [20],\n\n[21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] (as DeathNote).\n\nThe most common trait is the use of trojanized software that purports to assist the attackers’ target with the hiring process,\nnamely PDF viewers, remote access tools, and coding challenges. BlindingCan is the flagship RAT deployed to\ncompromised victims, but there are additional new and sophisticated malware projects at the attackers’ disposal, namely\nScoringMathTea and LightlessCan (we discuss these specific payloads in the ‘Backdoors’ section).\n\nThe attackers’ goals depend on the targeted sector. In particular for aerospace, our telemetry and the malware features\nindicate that the exfiltration of large amounts of sensitive data, like the company’s internal knowledge base, is of the\nhighest priority for the malware operators, and we conclude that the same applies to the defence sector. On the other hand,\nwhen the targeted network belongs to a technology or data company, then the attackers are after huge financial gain, which\nis performed via some form of business email compromise, or meddling with internal accounting systems. Finally, we don’t\nyet have any conclusion as to why in this operation Lazarus attacks western media (note the Comcast and Disney themes),\nbut these types of targets are less frequent.\n\nTable 3 shows a summary of Operation DreamJob attacks, as observed by ESET telemetry and in VirusTotal submissions\nsince late 2021. The theme contains the type of GUI delivered to the target (if present), together with the brand that the\nattackers falsely represented.\n\n**Date** **Country** **Theme** **Industry** **Payloads**\n\n2021-09 Belgium Amazon Media OfficeCertTea\n\n2021-10 Netherlands Amazon Aerospace BlindingCan, FudModule, HTTP(S)\nuploader\n\n2022-03 Spain Coding challenges + Aerospace BlindingCan, miniBlindingCan,\nMeta LightlessCan, NickelLoader\n\n2022-03 South Africa SecurePDF + Airbus ImprudentCook\n\n2022-06 Italy* MμPDF + Disney\n\n2022-10 Portugal*, SecurePDF + Airbus ScoringMathTea\nGermany*\n\n2022-11 Netherlands* TightVNC WinInetLoader, NickelLoader\n\n2023-01 India SecurePDF + Tech & Data miniBlindingCan, BlindingCan,\nUltraVNC + LightlessCan\nAccenture\n\n2023-02 Poland SecurePDF + Boeing Defence ScoringMathTea, ImprudentCook\n\n2023-02 - Comcast miniBlindingCan\n\n2023-03 Georgia* HSBC SimpleTea for Linux\n\n2023-05 Hungary* TightVNC + Rosatom WinInetLoader\n\n_Table 3: Instances of Operation DreamJob since late 2021. The asterisks indicate VirusTotal submissions._\n\n**Other attacks**\n\n**_Supply-chain attacks_**\n\nA software supply-chain attack occurs when an attacker infiltrates a software vendor’s network and employs malicious\ncode to compromise the software before the vendor distributes it to their customers (definition by [27]). Lazarus has proved\nits capability in performing such advanced attacks several times in the past. The first publicly known case was reported in\n2020 [28], when a legitimate download verification tool called WIZVERA Veraport, used mostly in South Korea, prompted\nits users to install malware via a browser plug-in after visiting compromised web servers. The deployed malware was\nvalidly signed by the code-signing certificate mentioned in Table 5. More recently, the following are the publicly known\nsupply-chain attacks attributed to the Lazarus group.\n\n**_Trading Technologies_**\n\nAround February 2022, a public website of Trading Technologies, a company with around 31,000 followers on LinkedIn, was\nallegedly compromised via an unknown method, which was reported in March 2022 by Google TAG [29] (note the website\n```\nwww.tradingtechnologies[.]com is mentioned among the IoCs). Interestingly, despite the publicly disclosed fact that\n\n```\nsomething strange was happening with Trading Technologies’ website, it didn’t prevent the chain of events that followed.\n\n|Date|Country|Theme|Industry|Payloads|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2021-09|Belgium|Amazon|Media|OfficeCertTea|\n|2021-10|Netherlands|Amazon|Aerospace|BlindingCan, FudModule, HTTP(S) uploader|\n|2022-03|Spain|Coding challenges + Meta|Aerospace|BlindingCan, miniBlindingCan, LightlessCan, NickelLoader|\n|2022-03|South Africa|SecurePDF + Airbus||ImprudentCook|\n|2022-06|Italy*|MμPDF + Disney|||\n|2022-10|Portugal*, Germany*|SecurePDF + Airbus||ScoringMathTea|\n|2022-11|Netherlands*|TightVNC||WinInetLoader, NickelLoader|\n|2023-01|India|SecurePDF + UltraVNC + Accenture|Tech & Data|miniBlindingCan, BlindingCan, LightlessCan|\n|2023-02|Poland|SecurePDF + Boeing|Defence|ScoringMathTea, ImprudentCook|\n|2023-02|*|Comcast||miniBlindingCan|\n|2023-03|Georgia*|HSBC||SimpleTea for Linux|\n|2023-05|Hungary*|TightVNC + Rosatom||WinInetLoader|\n\n\n-----\n\nIn April 2023, Mandiant published its report on the 3CX supply-chain incident [30]. This report extended information about\nthe 3CX compromise, and discussed a preceding supply chain attack that originated from Trading Technologies’ software\ninstaller package called X_TRADER, specifically version r7.17.90p608. Even though the package’s metadata states\nMarch 2020 as the creation date, it contains a tainted data file and a main executable, both with timestamps from early\nNovember 2021, which is several months before Google’s initial warning from March 2022.\n\nThe technical analysis of another instance of the same version of the malicious installer was provided by BroadCom in a\nblog post on 21 April 2023 [31]. This installer is malicious too, but the tainted data file and the main executable have the\nsame timestamps as the rest of the files: March 2020.\n\nFrom ESET’s telemetry, we saw two occurrences of the malicious installer reported by Mandiant: first in August 2022, in a\ncorporate network in the UK, and second in December 2022, at a small US consulting/trading firm.\n\nIn addition to these publicly known installers, we discovered in our telemetry an additional trojanized executable in an\nexecution chain started by a Trading Technologies installer binary. The trojanized executable was a validly signed\n```\nsetup.exe that was executed in the network of a construction company in Malaysia in August 2022. Although we were\n\n```\nnot able to find out what specific X_TRADER installer build was trojanized in this case, the filename of the next-stage\npayload differed from the one used in the Mandiant and BroadCom reports (TT User Setup-ja.mst was used instead\nof X_TRADER-ja.mst).\n\n**_3CX_**\n\nWe reported our account of the events related to the 3CX incident in a blog post on 20 April 2023 [32]. As far back as\nSeptember 2018, Trading Technologies had announced its plan to decommission the X_TRADER software in early 2020\nand replace it with a new HTML5-based trading platform [33]. Unfortunately, the end-of-life state of the software did not\nprevent a 3CX employee having it installed on a corporate machine, as we learned from the official incident response by\n_Mandiant [30]. This was the first-ever recorded case of two linked supply-chain attacks, one enabling the other._\n\n**_Exploitations_**\n\n**_Initech INISAFE CrossWeb EX V3_**\n\nThis vulnerability, which has not been assigned a CVE ID, was reported by AhnLab in April 2022 [34]. In the IoCs section,\nthey revealed multiple samples associated with the attacks, but we identified only a dropper of wAgentTea and the Racket\ndownloader [35]. According to AhnLab’s report, a legitimate INISAFE CrossWeb EX V3 process was injected by a\nmalicious DLL called SCSKAppLink.dll that originated from a malicious HTM website (see also [36] for an additional\ncase). The filename is a disguise for a component of the legitimate SoftCamp’s Secure KeyStroke application, which is\nrequired to access certain government and banking websites in South Korea.\n\n_ESET telemetry recorded a malicious SCSKAppLink.dll deployed against South Korean targets in June 2021. The_\ninitial compromise was made via what appears to be a watering-hole attack on the website of a local golf club not far\nfrom Seoul. An early version of ThreatNeedleTea, using an RC4-based network protocol, was delivered to the targets\nas well.\n\n**_CVE-2021-26606 (MagicLine4NX) [37]_**\n\nIn late October 2022, researchers from AhnLab reported [38] that the Lazarus group had started exploiting the\nCVE‑2021‑26606 vulnerability to gain additional access to the internal network of its South Korean victims.\n\nThis vulnerability is a buffer overflow that affects Dream Security’s MagicLine4NX software (a South Korean endpoint\nsecurity solution) versions 1.0.0.17 and earlier. Exploitation allows attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on targeted\nsystems. In the reported attacks, the MagicLine4NX process was used to inject a malicious thread into ftp.exe. Again,\nplenty of samples are mentioned in the IoCs, from which our team was able to identify FudModule [24] and its loaders as\nthe payloads among them.\n\n[In our telemetry from 2022, we identified several ftp.exe processes running shellcode, present exclusively among South](ftp://ftp.exe)\nKorean targets. The delivered payloads were wAgentTea dropped by a trojanized 64-bit liblzma v5.2.5 data compression\nlibrary, PostNapTea dropped by a trojanized lecui library, and multiple instances of ThreatNeedleTea.\n\n**_Unknown initial access_**\n\nThere are also attacks targeting South Korea where we were unable to identify the intrusion method:\n\n - Unknown entity in January 2022. Deployed malware: wAgentTea.\n\n - Newspaper in February 2022. Deployed malware: PostNapTea.\n\n - Unknown entity in July 2022. Deployed malware: VMProtect-ed FudModule.\n\n\n-----\n\n - An agriculture-related entity targeted in February 2023. Deployed malware: PostNapTea.\n\n - Semiconductor industry in April 2023. Deployed malware: wAgentTea.\n\n**TTPs**\n\nSince there are many attacks attributed to the group, it’s possible to see high-level patterns in its behaviour. In this section,\nwe provide a summary of which open-source projects were chosen to be trojanized, what encryption methods are\nimplemented in the payloads, and which valid code-signing certificates were observed.\n\n**Execution chain**\n\nTo deliver malware and its configurations securely, the group usually arranges multiple stages of execution. This is a\nnatural evolution as their most used payloads became exposed in previous attacks, and are now identified and detected. If\nthey want to reuse them, a viable option is to store them in an encrypted state on the file system and precede their execution\nwith a series of droppers and loaders. See Figure 2 for an example of a complex execution chain (note that four additional\nmalicious helper executables are involved to load a RAT, the last step of the chain).\n\n_Figure 2: A complex execution chain used by Lazarus in recent Operation DreamJob campaigns._\n\n**Trojanized open-source projects**\n\nIn recent years, Lazarus has started to incorporate its malicious code into open-source projects available online in hosting\nservices like GitHub. The purpose is twofold: first, to trojanize a legitimate project into a dropper containing an embedded,\nencrypted next stage, possibly evading detection (note that only a fraction of the new executable is malicious); second, to\nhave a seemingly legitimate GUI that serves various scenarios in social engineering attacks.\n\n**_Plug-ins for Notepad++_**\n\nWe observed Lazarus extensively trojanizing plug-in projects for Notepad++, exclusively to use them as droppers for the\nnext stage. All plug-ins are DLLs and a common feature is the presence of the following exported functions: beNotified,\n```\ngetFuncsArray, getName, isUnicode, messageProc, and setInfo. Interestingly, the attackers use these droppers for\n\n```\nside-loading via a legitimate application, so these plug-ins also contain exports unrelated to Notepad++, but required by\nthe loading executable. For example, the MZC8051 plug-in from the Spanish case in Q2 2022 [25] also contains the export\n```\nHidP_GetSpecificValueCaps that is imported by tabcal.exe, its parent process. The attackers had to craft the source\n\n```\ncode of these DLLs carefully, as they didn’t want to break this side-loading process. The list of Notepad++ plug-ins that\nwere used by Lazarus in campaigns since 2021 is shown in Table 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Plug-in|Developer|Description|Attack|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|NppExport 0.3.0|chcg|Export plug-in for Notepad++|[39]|\n|NppAStyle 0.2.7|YWX|Artistic Style plug-in for Notepad++|VT [35]|\n|ComparePlus 1.0.0|Pavel Nedev|File comparison plug-in for Notepad++|[26], [35]|\n|FingerText 0.5.60, 0.5.61|erinata|Snippet plug-in for Notepad++|[40] Operation DreamJob in India Q1 2023|\n|GOnpp 1.2.0.0|tike|Go programming language plug-in for Notepad++|[40]|\n|Flashing-Tip|Tipikin Aleksandr|Notepad++ plug-in|[25]|\n|MZC8051 0.1.1.0|Don HO|MZC8051 C compiler plug-in for Notepad++|[25]|\n|LuaUtils 1.4.0.0|Charsi82|Lua plug-in for Notepad++|[25]|\n|NppyPlugin|Jari Pennanen|General Python plug-in for Notepad++|[25]|\n|FWDataViz 2.6.1.0|Shridhar Kumar|Fixed-width data visualizer plug-in for Notepad++|[22] [41]|\n|GotoLineCol 2.4.2.0|Shridhar Kumar|Go to line, column plug-in for Notepad++|Operation DreamJob in India Q1 2023|\n|Hex Editor Plugin 0.9.12|Jens Lorenz|Hex editor plug-in for Notepad++|Operation DreamJob April 2023|\n\n\n_Table 4: A list of Notepad++ open-source plug-ins used by Lazarus in campaigns since 2021._\n\n**_PDF readers_**\n\nIn this scenario, the attackers offer their target (at least) two files: a PDF viewer/reader and a PDF file. The target is instructed\nto open the provided PDF file with the provided PDF software. Because the PDF file is either incomplete or does not even\nhave the proper format of a PDF document, opening it in any other PDF software leads to displaying an incomplete content or\nerror message that the file is corrupt. In this way, the target may feel forced to follow the attackers’ instructions and open the\nPDF in the provided viewer. This action triggers the malicious branch within the trojanized application (that is, by checking\nthe MD5 hash of the PDF file against a hard-coded value). The proper content is displayed (decrypted from the PDF or\ndownloaded from a C&C server), but, at the same time, the target’s system is compromised, and the attackers are free to\ndeliver additional payloads. Figure 3 shows an example of a full job description displayed to the target.\n\n_Figure 3: Full job description, starting on page 2, displayed in a trojanized MμPDF reader. The page shows no content in_\n_any other PDF software._\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have recorded several types of PDF software used by Lazarus. These are usually based on open-source apps available\nonline:\n\n[• SecurePDF/SumatraPDF [42] versions 3.2 and 3.3, originally by Krystof Kowalczyk.](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf)\n\n[• MμPDF [43] version 1.19.0, originally by Artifex.](https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=summary)\n\n[• Aloha PDF Reader, which is based on the open-source Tinker and UXReader PDF libraries [44] for Windows, both](https://github.com/vfr/UXReader-Windows)\n[originally by Julius Oklamcak; the latter is in turn based on the PDFium library [45].](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/)\n\n - PDF Viewer for WinForms, originally by DevExpress.\n\n[• Internal PDF Viewer 3.0 for macOS, based on [46] Apple’s built-in Quartz.PDFKit.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartz/pdfkit)\n\n**Remote access tools**\n\nIn this scenario, the attackers require their target to connect to a remote computer – an action that’s purportedly essential to\ncontinue with the hiring process. The victim receives a trojanized remote access tool together with connection details like\nan IP address or a username, and a password. The malicious branch is triggered when the target picks the corresponding\nconnection in the provided GUI.\n\nThese network tools have been observed:\n\n - PuTTY ([41])\n\n - KiTTY ([23])\n\n - UltraVNC (see Figure 4)\n\n - TightVNC ([41]; also see Figure 4)\n\n[• LoginPortal, based on the ImGUI project [47]](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)\n\n_Figure 4: Amazon-themed dialogs of trojanized UltraVNC and TightVNC remote access tools._\n\n**Code-signing certificates**\n\nThe group often uses code-signing certificates to sign native payloads. The main motivation is to make their operations\nlook legitimate, as users and security solutions tend to trust signed software more than unsigned. In the following section,\nwe will look more closely at how Lazarus has been using these in its operations.\n\n**_Pre-2022_**\n\nIn this period, the attackers seemed to follow the same pattern regarding the code-signing certificates they used. There were\nmultiple Lazarus operations with different, but similar, certificates. The repeating pattern was that they were issued to\nrelatively unknown American or British companies, with no apparent sort of business that requires digital certificates, and with\nno online presence in general. Table 5 lists certificates used by Lazarus in various attacks and campaigns known before 2022.\nIn the last column we state the type of campaign, together with a reference to a public report mentioning the certificate.\n\n\n-----\n\nRegarding macOS systems, the attackers used valid code-signing certificates several times. A signed Mac executable\ndisguised as a job description for Coinbase was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil on 11 August 2022. According to the\ntimestamp, the bundle was signed on 21 July using a certificate issued in February 2022 to a developer named Shankey\nNohria and team identifier 264HFWQH63. The application is not notarized, and Apple revoked the certificate on 12 August.\nEven earlier, a signed Mac executable disguised as a job description for Bitazu Capital was submitted to VirusTotal from\nSingapore on 31 March 2021. It was signed using a certificate issued in late March 2021 to an organization presumably\nnamed ‘Golden Book’ with team identifier H5YL5668C7 and using the Apple ID goldenbook2021@icloud[.]com.\n_Apple revoked this certificate on 10 November 2021. In June 2023, certificates issued to two additional organizations were_\nobserved in the DangerousPassword attacks: BBQ BAZAAR PRIVATE LIMITED (team identifier 7L2UQTVP6F) and DPS\nEXPRESS COMPANY LIMITED (team identifier PN6L92RH7B).\n\n**Subject name** **Country** **Email** **Type of activity**\n\n16:20 Software, LLC Pennsylvania, US N/A Operation In(ter)ception [11]\n\n2 TOY GUYS Florida, US N/A Operation DreamJob [20]\n\n726 Lucile Development\nNew Mexico, US harryifrost@yahoo[.]com Operation In(ter)ception [11]\nLLC\n\nBRAIN Technology INC Oklahoma, US lucasvcastillo.x@gmail[.]com Operation In(ter)ception [11]\n\nAlexis Security Group\nArizona, US RaymondJBurkett@protonmail[.]com WIZVERA supply chain [28]\nLLC\n\nDREAM SECURITY\nCalifornia, US N/A WIZVERA supply chain [28]\nUSA INC\n\n“A” MEDICAL OFFICE, Operation DreamJob [26],\nNew York, US N/A\nPLLC, [40]\n\nExploited INITECH software\nDOCTER USA, INC.

In order to protect their operations – especially\nthe payloads of later stages, the configuration files, and the network protocol – they incorporate strong ciphers in their code\n(using either a low-level implementation or a high-level one via Windows Cryptographic Providers). Table 7 shows a\nsummary of encryption algorithms observed in payloads from their attacks in the time frame 2022-2023. From the length of\nkeys, it’s obvious that security is high and brute-force attacks are out of the question (we didn’t analyse whether reductions\nin the encryption complexity are possible in these cases).\n\n|Subject name|Country|Email|Type of activity|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|16:20 Software, LLC|Pennsylvania, US|N/A|Operation In(ter)ception [11]|\n|2 TOY GUYS|Florida, US|N/A|Operation DreamJob [20]|\n|726 Lucile Development LLC|New Mexico, US|harryifrost@yahoo[.]com|Operation In(ter)ception [11]|\n|BRAIN Technology INC|Oklahoma, US|lucasvcastillo.x@gmail[.]com|Operation In(ter)ception [11]|\n|Alexis Security Group LLC|Arizona, US|RaymondJBurkett@protonmail[.]com|WIZVERA supply chain [28]|\n|DREAM SECURITY USA INC|California, US|N/A|WIZVERA supply chain [28]|\n|“A” MEDICAL OFFICE, PLLC,|New York, US|N/A|Operation DreamJob [26], [40]|\n|DOCTER USA, INC.|Florida, US|bernardmking@tutanota.com|Exploited INITECH software [35]|\n|MATCH CONSULTANTS LTD|Tackley, GB|N/A|From VirusTotal, unreported|\n|SAMOYAJ|West Yorkshire, GB|N/A|Operation In(ter)ception [48]|\n\n|Subject name|Country|Email|Type of activity|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Baltkot|Saint Petersburg, RU|baltkod@yandex.ru|Operation In(ter)ception|\n|Dmitry Raykhman|New York, US|alexander132@protonmail.com|DangerousPassword attacks|\n|Damion Spencer|Merseyside, UK|damions112@proton.me|DangerousPassword attacks|\n|Scan-trader ApS|Midtjylland, DK|scan-trader@mail.ee|Operation In(ter)ception|\n|Cold Air Systems|Ontario, CA|rezulbrown@protonmail.com|DangerousPassword attacks|\n\n\n-----\n\n|AES|NickelLoader (128-bit), WebbyTea (256-bit), ImprudentCook (128-bit), PostNapTea, wAgentTea (128-bit), SecondHandTea (256-bit); BlindingCan (256-bit + LZ4); miniBlindingCan (256-bit + LZ4); various droppers (128-bit); IconicLoader (Galois/Counter Mode, GCM); SimpleTea for Linux (GCM)|\n|---|---|\n|HC|OfficeCertTea (128-bit); dropper of ComeBacker [10] (256-bit)|\n|A5/1|SimpleTea (96-bit)|\n|(custom) RC4|In(ter)ception backdoor, BackbitingTea, BlindingCan, miniBlindingCan|\n|RC5|Racket downloader (256-bit)|\n|RC6|LightlessCan (256-bit)|\n|ChaCha20|In(ter)ception backdoor, new ThreatNeedleTea|\n|Salsa20|Dropper of ScoringMathTea (256-bit)|\n|IDEA|ScoringMathTea|\n|Panama|WinInetLoader (256-bit)|\n|VEST-32|Payload from early Operation DreamJob [49]|\n|(custom) DES-based|LPEClientTea [26]|\n\n\n_Table 7. Encryption ciphers used in Lazarus payloads._\n\n**Rich Headers analysis**\n\nJust as before [9], we looked at the Rich Headers metadata [50] from the PE headers of payloads involved in the Lazarus\nattacks. Based on our data, the majority of attacks target 64-bit systems, as we see four times more 64-bit executables than\n32-bit ones. Unlike the results from 2018, in the time since H2 2020 there were no builds by Visual Studio 98.\n\nTable 8 presents an overview of which Visual Studio linker was used to produce various types of Lazarus malware. It\nseems that the majority of projects are developed in Visual Studio 2010. Interestingly, there’s homogeneity in the origin of\nsamples associated with Operation In(ter)ception – produced mostly with Visual Studio 2015 (and mostly with the linker\nversion 14.0.24215).\n\n**Linker version** **Developed malware**\n\nVisual Studio 2010 NickelLoader, WebbyTea, OfficeCertTea, BackbitingTea,\n(10.0.30319) SecondHandTea, LightlessCan, old ThreatNeedleTea\n\nVisual Studio 2010 SP1 BackbitingTea, ImprudentCook, ScoringMathTea, HTTP(S) uploader,\n(10.0.40219) BlindingCan, miniBlindingCan, FudModule, new ThreatNeedleTea\n\nVisual Studio 2015 Operation In(ter)ception (including droppers, loaders, injectors,\n(14.0.24215 + 14.0.24210) downloaders, and backdoors)\n\nVisual Studio 2017 wAgentTea\n(14.11.25547)\n\nVisual Studio 2019 PostNapTea, WinInetLoader\n(14.16.27031, 14.21.27702,\n14.29.30146)\n\n_Table 8: A summary of Visual Studio linkers used to produce Lazarus malware._\n\n**BACKDOORS**\n\nWhile the toolset used by Lazarus is large and has evolved over time, in this section we focus only on the most\nrepresentative payloads that were acquired in recent years. All payloads from the initial stages, which serve mostly the\npurpose of establishing a stable foothold on the compromised system like document macros, scripts, native droppers, and\nloaders, are omitted. Under the term ‘backdoors’ we include all payloads that bring significant abilities to the attackers like\ndownloaders with multi-step authentication and full-featured RATs. We try to refrain from calling these final, as there may\nbe additional, but rarely seen, malware delivered based on the attackers’ goals. Examples of payloads that could be\nconsidered final are the HTTP(S) uploader [40], FudModule [24], a keylogger, and a screenshot taker [51].\n\nIn the figures in this section, the procedure names are our interpretation of their function, not original symbolic information\nby the authors. Even if the executable is not a C++ project, we prefer to use the convention class::method, where the class\nis a general description (like Core, System, HTTP, Command, etc.) and the method is a specific description (like parse_\n```\ncommands, get_processes, write_read_exchange, read_file, etc.).\n\n```\n|Linker version|Developed malware|\n|---|---|\n|Visual Studio 2010 (10.0.30319)|NickelLoader, WebbyTea, OfficeCertTea, BackbitingTea, SecondHandTea, LightlessCan, old ThreatNeedleTea|\n|Visual Studio 2010 SP1 (10.0.40219)|BackbitingTea, ImprudentCook, ScoringMathTea, HTTP(S) uploader, BlindingCan, miniBlindingCan, FudModule, new ThreatNeedleTea|\n|Visual Studio 2015 (14.0.24215 + 14.0.24210)|Operation In(ter)ception (including droppers, loaders, injectors, downloaders, and backdoors)|\n|Visual Studio 2017 (14.11.25547)|wAgentTea|\n|Visual Studio 2019 (14.16.27031, 14.21.27702, 14.29.30146)|PostNapTea, WinInetLoader|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Downloaders**\n\n**_NickelLoader_**\n\nWe observed this payload for the first time in the Spanish case of Operation DreamJob [25]. NickelLoader is an HTTP(S)\ndownloader that recognizes four commands, all five letters long (abcde, avdrq, gabnc and dcrqv). The length of these\ncommand names invoked a loose association with a slang term for the US five-cent coin – a nickel – so we named this\nbackdoor NickelLoader. The most important commands are avdrq and gabnc, each of which loads a received buffer as a\n[DLL. For this purpose, the attackers likely used MemoryModule [52], a library that can be used to load a DLL completely](https://github.com/fancycode/MemoryModule)\nfrom memory.\n\nAnother occurrence of NickelLoader was recorded on 6 June 2022. A user from Italy submitted a disk image called\n```\nDisneyPDF.iso to VirusTotal. The image contained two files: a trojanized open-source PDF viewer, DisneyPDF.exe,\n\n```\n[(the original, legitimate code is available online as MμPDF 1.19.0) and a fake job offer claiming to be from the Disney](https://mupdf.com/downloads/archive/mupdf-1.19.0-source.tar.gz)\n_Corporation called JD.pdf. However, the document JD.pdf does not contain any job description, just the front page with_\na Disney theme and an additional two pages with the note ‘No Preview Available’. Pages 2 and 3 appear only if opened\nwith the DisneyPDF.exe reader (as it contains another PDF file with full content embedded and encrypted in its body);\nsee Figure 3 above.\n\nAnother case was reported by Microsoft in September 2022 [22]. A trojanized TightVNC Viewer disguised as\n```\nIBMTech‑VNC.exe dropped a variant of NickelLoader with updated names for the commands (eknag, eacec, hjmwk,\nwohnp) and slightly different implementation. Instead of loading a DLL via MemoryModule, it simply executes the\n\n```\nattacker’s shellcode provided from the C&C server.\n\nA variant of NickelLoader was mentioned as LIDSHOT in the blog post by Mandiant in March 2023 [53].\n\n**_WebbyTea_**\n\nThis malware is a downloader associated with DangerousPassword attacks. We named this based on the string web_t,\nwhich is present in the PDB information of its dropper (Y:\\E\\Code\\Developing\\C\\web_t\\PdfViewer\\x64\\\n```\nRelease\\DevExpress.XtraList.v19.2.pdb). A variant of WebbyTea was reported as Persistent Backdoor #1 in [51].\n\n```\nIn July 2023 we also saw a variant of native WebbyTea for macOS systems.\n\nInitially, it expects a base26-encoded URL (see Figure 5) stored in the registry key Desktop located at HKEY_CURRENT_\n```\nUSER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Accessibility (this artifact is deleted immediately after the malware successfully reads it).\n\n```\n_Figure 5: Base26-encoded URL decoded at WebbyTea’s startup._\n\nDuring initialization, the malware generates a unique identifier for the victim, based on the user and computer names, and\nthe current time. Then it collects the following data (for illustration, we provide a PowerShell command in parentheses that\noutputs the same value):\n\n - Proxy settings (Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\\n```\n  Internet Settings' | Select ProxyEnable, ProxyServer, AutoConfigUrl)\n\n```\n - Installation date (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object -Property\n```\n  InstallDate)\n\n```\n  - _Windows product name and version (Get-ComputerInfo | Select WindowsProductName,_\n```\n  OsHardwareAbstractionLayer)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n - Manufacturer (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem | Select-Object -Property\n```\n  Manufacturer)\n\n```\n - Product name (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystemProduct | Select-Object\n```\n  -Property Name)\n\n```\n - System boot time (systeminfo | find \"System Boot Time\")\n\n - Time zone (Get-TimeZone | Select-Object -Property \"DisplayName\")\n\n - Computer name\\username ($env:computername \\ $env:username)\n\n - Current time (Get-Date)\n\n - List of running processes formatted, including PID, session ID, PPID, image name, and bitness (Get-CimInstance\n```\n  Win32_Process | Select ProcessId, SessionId, ParentProcessId, Name)\n\n```\nThe system data is then encrypted using the AES-256 ECB cipher and a hard-coded key. The encrypted data is sent to a\nC&C server and the response is expected to be a DLL that is loaded and executed as a remote thread in a newly created\n```\nexplorer.exe process.\n\n```\n**_OfficeCertTea_**\n\nWe observed both 32-bit and 64-bit variants of OfficeCertTea in the wild, for example in Q2 2021 in Belgium [40]. This\npayload was also mentioned by Kaspersky in April 2023 [26], under the generic name ‘Downloader Loader’, so we decided\nto name it after one of its in-the-wild filenames, officecert.ocx.\n\nDuring initialization, the malware generates a unique identifier for the victim, based on the user and computer name, and\nthe current time. Then it collects the following data (again, a PowerShell command is provided for illustration) and sends it\nto the C&C server:\n\n - Computer name\\username ($env:computername \\ $env:username)\n\n  - _Windows product name, version, and architecture (Get-ComputerInfo | Select WindowsProductName,_\n```\n  WindowsCurrentVersion, OSArchitecture)\n\n```\n - Info about the local computer according to the DNS ($env:userdomain and Get-CimInstance -ClassName\n```\n  Win32_ComputerSystem | Select DNSHostName)\n\n```\n - Logical drives (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_LogicalDisk | Select DeviceID)\n\n - List of running processes formatted, including PID, PPID, and image name (Get-CimInstance Win32_Process |\n```\n  Select ProcessId, ParentProcessId, Name)\n\n```\n - Architecture: adds the same value as the bitness of the malware and is hard-coded.\n\nIn Figure 6, the four-step communication of OfficeCertTea is visible in the form of pseudocode. An encrypted DLL to load\nis received in the final, fourth step.\n\n_Figure 6: The main communication steps of OfficeCertTea._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_ImprudentCook_**\n\nThis payload was reported for the first time by AhnLab in June 2021 [39]. Most notable is that it’s hidden, together with its\nconfiguration and an AES-128 key for its decryption, in an ADS stream of its dropper. We saw two in-the-wild cases, both\nof the Operation DreamJob type of activity. We decided to name it ImprudentCook because the module contains two arrays\nof strings that represent cookie names for services, including Bing, Daum and GitHub:\n\n1. `iKc;__uid;OAX;DMP_UID;PCID;_gid;_gat;csrftoken;NID;1P_JAR;JSESSIONID;WLS;SNID;__`\n```\n   utma;BID;SRCHD;GsCK_AC;spintop;eader;XSRF-TOKEN;_gat_gtag_UA;webid_\n   enabled;EDGE_V;dtck_channel;dtmulti;UUID;XUID;ZIA;IUID;SSID;_gh_sess;_octo\n\n```\n2. `channel;post_titles;xfw_exp;wiht_clkey;SGPCOUPLE;NRTK;fbp;uaid;SRCHUSR;GUC;HPVN;dtck_`\n```\n   blog;dtck_media;MUIDB;SRCHHPGUSR;SiteMain\n\n```\nThis is a quite distinguishing feature from other Lazarus payloads; however, the array of cookies was not leveraged later in\nthe code. It contains information that looks like the version and the value was 5.60 in both cases (the version of the payload\nfrom AhnLab’s report was 5.40).\n\nFor proper functioning, the malware requires a configuration stored in the parent process’s executable, in an ADS stream\ncalled :rsrc. It contains multiple URLs and a UID of the client. The main functionality of ImprudentCook is to connect to\na responding C&C server, authenticate with the server in three major steps, and receive and load additional stages in the\nform of DLLs. The exchanged content is Base64 encoded and AES-128 encrypted.\n\n**_WinInetLoader_**\n\nLazarus trojanized various Notepad++ projects (which we described in more detail in the ‘Plugins for Notepad++’ section)\nto drop and execute this malicious WinInetLoader HTTP(S) downloader. We decided on this nickname because the\nmalicious part repeatedly resolves Windows APIs from wininet.dll using the library name ‘WinInet’ in camel case.\n\nFor an HTTP query to be accepted by the server, malware authors usually choose constant parameter names. To increase\nvariety (likely for network detection evasion), the attackers decided to loosen the format of the query and allow multiple\nparameter names in their HTTP queries. The names are sorted in three arrays and formatted into the %s= part of the query;\nsee Figure 6. The arrays are as follows:\n\n1. `idxAp, idv, lid, ds_s_kwgid, gclid, cx, eqid, cvid, sv_pq, ylt`\n\n2. `q, board, orderBy, rangeType, iscqry, pq, wd, kid, bdx, licu`\n\n3. `gs_, ved, rsv_t, iylc, refig, w, ei, ds_e_adid, sig, list`\n\nEach parameter is chosen randomly. Moreover, there’s a hard-coded value of the second parameter within the client: see\nFigure 7.\n\n_Figure 7: HTTP(S) query of WinInetLoader with randomly chosen parameters from three groups of names._\n\nThe network communication consists of two HTTP exchanges. The first is Base64 encoded and serves as the authentication\nstep. The second is both Base64 encoded and encrypted by Panama [54], which is a quite uncommon 256-bit stream cipher,\nand the result is a buffer with a command for what to do next. Based on the value of the command, one of the following is\nperformed:\n```\n • 0x11173: a third HTTP exchange is realized (Base64 encoded and Panama encrypted).\n • 0x11174: shellcode is included in the buffer and the malware executes it.\n • 0x11176: the client disconnects.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**_wAgentTea_**\n\nIn December 2020, Kaspersky [55] reported on Lazarus attacking entities related to COVID-19 research. A payload called\nwAgent was dropped and loaded by the trojanized legitimate compression utility XZ Utils. We recorded deployment of very\nsimilar wAgent variants against mostly South Korean targets. As the name of the malware collides (at least phonemically)\nwith various legitimate software projects or their components, we added the usual suffix Tea for its designation.\n\nAs in the Kaspersky blog post, there is a list of hard-coded parameter names used in an HTTP request:\n```\n identy;tname;blogdata;content;thesis;method;bbs;level;maincode;tab;idx;tb;isbn;entry;doc;\n category;articles;portal;notice;product;themes;manual;parent;slide;vacon;tag;tistory;\n property;course;plugin\n\n```\nThe network communication between the client and the server involves several exchanges of HTTP request/response pairs,\nalways protected by the combination of Base64 encoding and AES-128 encryption. The final step is receiving a DLL that is\nloaded and executed using the MemoryModule method, just as in the case of NickelLoader. This classifies wAgentTea as a\nsophisticated downloader.\n\n**_miniBlindingCan_**\n\nIn [25], we spotted malware sharing the starting command ID 0x2009 with BlindingCan, but with only a small subset of\nthe remaining command IDs, so it does not support BlindingCan’s full set of features (see Figure 8). Instead, this malware\nhas the ability to download new shellcode and exchange its configuration with the C&C server. Because of this significant\nreduction, we decided just to add the prefix ‘mini-’ to the name. Note that both pieces of malware mostly likely share the\nsame implementation of the C&C server part.\n\n_Figure 8: Command parsing by miniBlindingCan with command IDs highlighted. Only the value 0x2009 is shared with_\n_BlindingCan._\n\n**Full-featured RATs**\n\n**_BadCall/SimpleTea_**\n\nThese payloads are compiled from a common code base for all major platforms: Windows, Linux and macOS. As the\nsamples were collected over various attacks in time and have overlapping functionality, the naming ambiguities were\nintroduced.\n\nIn April 2023 [32], in relation to the 3CX incident, we reported on two Linux payloads, named BadCall for Linux and\nSimplexTea (which we alternatively call SimpleTea for Linux). The first is supposed to run on Linux servers and decrypts\nits configuration from /tmp/vgauthsvclog using 0x5E as the XOR key. The second is more complex. It’s an\nobject‑oriented project, which does not run on Linux distributions without a graphical user interface, and decrypts its\n\n\n-----\n\nconfiguration from /home/%user%/.config/apdl.cf using 0x7E as the XOR key. From the class names implementing\nthe supported commands, it looks like the latter project was based on the first one, and additionally expanded its features.\nWe concluded that both of these Linux payloads come from the same attackers.\n\nStill, we were looking for a connection to Lazarus. There is a report by CISA from September 2019 [57] that describes\nproxy server RATs for Windows that use the same fake TLS communication trick as the Linux payload for servers. That was\nthe reason we decided to denote the Linux malware as BadCall. However, the code of these Windows tools does not contain\nthe command parsing logic that is present in SimpleTea; see Table 9. Because of the fake TLS trick with the same list of\nmasquerading domains (see [32], Figure 4), and the use of the A5 stream cipher (see [32], Figure 5), we conclude that this\nevidence is sufficient for the attribution verdict.\n\nThere is a macOS build of SimpleTea as well. In February 2021 [58], CISA reported on macOS samples involved in the\ncryptocurrency theft-motivated attacks from 2020. A payload named prtspool is included in the list. It loads its\nconfiguration from an XOR-encrypted configuration stored in /private/etc/krb5d.conf (a single-byte key, 0x5E, is\nused for its decryption). Most importantly, it has an analogical implementation of command parsing; see Table 9.\n\nThanks to the report by Kaspersky [59] on the 3CX incident and their description of a Gopuram loader, we finally\ndiscovered also the Windows counterpart of the SimpleTea malware in ESET’s telemetry. A payload displays the required\nsimilarities like the loading of the configuration file (Figure 9), the A5 cipher, and the supported commands (Table 9). The\nattackers managed to deploy this malware as a memory-only payload against an individual from Germany in January 2022.\nAt the same time, a variant of Gopuram loader was dropped on the victim’s file system as C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\\n```\nncobjapi.dll. This shows a relationship between SimpleTea for Windows and the Gopuram loader, and also adds up to\n\n```\nthe attribution of all three cases: the HSBC-themed malware targeting Linux users; the 3CX incident, and the individual\nfrom Germany.\n\n_Figure 9: A routine in SimpleTea for Windows showing how the configuration file mfds.ax is decrypted using the 0x5E XOR_\n_key._\n\n**Command** **Windows** **Linux (Server/Desktop)** **macOS**\n\nMSG_ReadConfig `0x3521` `0x5252/0x27CA` `0x3521`\n\nMSG_WriteConfig `0x3522` `0x5253/0x27CB` `0x3522`\n\nMSG_Del/MSG_SecureDel `0x3523` `0x5244/0x27CC` `0x3523`\n\nMSG_Up `0x3524` `0x523F/0x27CD` `0x3524`\n\nMSG_Down `0x3525` `0x5240/0x27CE` `0x3525`\n\nMSG_Cmd `0x3529` `0x5246/0x27D2` `0x3529`\n\nMSG_Run `0x352A` `0x5243/0x27D3` `0x352A`\n\nMSG_Dir `0x352C` `0x523E/0x27D5` `0x352C`\n\nMSG_Test `0x352F` `0x524B/0x27D8` `0x352F`\n\nMSG_SetPath `0x3530` `0x524A/0x27D9` `0x3530`\n\nMSG_GetComInfo N/A `0x5249/0x27D8` N/A\n\nMSG_Sleep N/A `0x5251/0x27C4` N/A\n\nCMsgZip `0x3527` N/A /0x27D0 N/A\n\n_Table 9: Indices of SimpleTea commands for Windows, Linux and macOS._\n\n|Command|Windows|Linux (Server/Desktop)|macOS|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|MSG_ReadConfig|0x3521|0x5252/0x27CA|0x3521|\n|MSG_WriteConfig|0x3522|0x5253/0x27CB|0x3522|\n|MSG_Del/MSG_SecureDel|0x3523|0x5244/0x27CC|0x3523|\n|MSG_Up|0x3524|0x523F/0x27CD|0x3524|\n|MSG_Down|0x3525|0x5240/0x27CE|0x3525|\n|MSG_Cmd|0x3529|0x5246/0x27D2|0x3529|\n|MSG_Run|0x352A|0x5243/0x27D3|0x352A|\n|MSG_Dir|0x352C|0x523E/0x27D5|0x352C|\n|MSG_Test|0x352F|0x524B/0x27D8|0x352F|\n|MSG_SetPath|0x3530|0x524A/0x27D9|0x3530|\n|MSG_GetComInfo|N/A|0x5249/0x27D8|N/A|\n|MSG_Sleep|N/A|0x5251/0x27C4|N/A|\n|CMsgZip|0x3527|N/A /0x27D0|N/A|\n\n\n-----\n\n**_BlindingCan_**\n\nBlindingCan is a full-featured RAT whose name was coined by CISA in August 2020 [60]. It is one of the most notorious\npayloads associated with Lazarus and has been observed in many of their attacks and reported multiple times, e.g. [23]\n(called AIRDRY), [25], [40], [61].\n\n**_LightlessCan_**\n\nIn [25], we discovered a new RAT that we decided to call LightlessCan (the name is inspired by BlindingCan). We consider\nit a major shift in comparison with its predecessor. The most notable is the malware developers’ focus on mimicking the\nfunctionality of the usual red-teaming Windows commands, like wmic, whoami, `systeminfo, netstat, netsh`\n```\nadvfirewall, tasklist, ipconfig, net, schstasks, reg, sc, ping/ping6, etc. By executing the code within their\n\n```\nmalware, instead of on the command line, they significantly reduce the noisiness that behaviour-based security solutions\nlike EDRs monitor. It seems that Lazarus takes detection evasion as a serious priority (note also the sophisticated\nEDR‑blinding malware FudModule at their disposal). We didn’t conclude whether they more likely reversed Windows\nsystem binaries or got inspired by the code available via the Wine project (or both). In the previously reported Lazarus\nattacks [19], these commands were executed multiple times after the attackers had gained a foothold in the target’s system.\n\nA variant of LightlessCan seems to be have been reported under the name SIDESHOW by Mandiant in March 2023 [53].\n\n**_PostNapTea_**\n\nThis payload is a complex object-oriented project that has not yet been described in public. It stores its configuration in\nJSON format (an example of such a configuration is shown in Listing 1 below). The version 0.0.1 suggests that this is a\nnew development.\n\nIt resolves the Windows APIs it requires during runtime, via the Fowler–Noll–Vo (FNV) hash function (note that\nScoringMathTea does that similarly, but the algorithm is a modified Justin Sobel hash). There are five classes that represent\ncommand groups:\n```\n • CCButton: for file manipulation and screen capturing\n • CCBitmap: for network commands\n • CCComboBox: for file system management\n • CCList: for process management\n • CCBrush: for control of the malware itself\n        {\n          \"proxylist\": [{\n            \"proxy\": \"https0x3A//www.takegawahelmet.com.tw\",\n            \"url\": \"/wp-includes/SimplePie/Net/IPv4.php\"\n          }],\n          \"service\": \"\",\n          \"process\": \"\",\n          \"count\": 10,\n          \"default_sleep\": 10,\n          \"type\": 3,\n          \"ckey\": \"WfClq6HxbSaOuJGaH5kWXr7dQgjYNSNg\",\n          \"id\": \"Z5UAHijc\",\n          \"ver\": \"0.0.1\",\n          \"monitor_process\": \"false\",\n          \"monitor_usb\": \"true\",\n          \"monitor_session\": \"true\",\n          \"monitor_hiber\": \"false\",\n          \"dir\": \"C0x3A\\Windows\",\n          \"cmd\": \"C0x3A\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\",\n          \"hibernate\": 0\n        }\n\n```\n_Listing 1: PostNapTea’s configuration in JSON._\n\nFirst, the group CCButton contains four commands for file manipulation and screen capturing. Next, the CCBitmap class\nimplements functionality that mimics Windows commands often used by attackers after compromising a system. The\nsupported commands are sc, reg, arp, net, ver, wmic, ping, whoami, netstat, tracert, lookup, ipconfig,\n```\nsysteminfo, and netsh advfirewall. Similar to the LightlessCan case, creating their own implementations of these\n\n```\n\n-----\n\ncommands allows them to operate more stealthily and lowers the chance of being detected by behavioural security products\nlike EDRs.\n\nNext, the class CCComboBox contains commands related to file system manipulation: deleting a file securely, getting a\ndirectory’s content, getting a list of drives, creating a new folder, setting the file times, getting properties of a folder, and\nrenaming a file.\n\nIn the class CCList, various commands for process management are implemented: unloading a DLL, creating a new\nprocess, creating a new process as a user, injecting a DLL in a process, killing a process, and getting a process list.\n\nFinally, the class CCBrush implements features for controlling the malware itself: getting information about the victim,\nupdating the JSON configuration, sending the configuration to the C&C server, and testing a C&C connection.\n\n**_BackbitingTea and SecondHandTea_**\n\nThese two payloads are full-featured RATs and seem like flagship backdoors used in the DangerousPassword campaigns.\nBoth malware projects appear to be based on the same code base. They differ in several properties like the paths of the\nconfiguration files (see the bullet list below), the network library (openSSL-1.1.0f vs. wolfSSL vs. Winsock TCP/IP), the\nencryption (RC4 vs. AES-256), and the compression (LZ4 vs. ZIP). Overall, however, from Table 10 it’s obvious that most\nof the functionality between variants of BackbitingTea (observed in Canada in March 2022, and in the United States in\nDecember 2022) and SecondHandTea is shared.\n\n**Functionality** **SecondHandTea** **BackbitingTea Canada** **BackbitingTea USA**\n\nGet system info `0x00` `0x6F00620069006E` `0xE2FCD92E`\n\nGet disk info `0x01` `0x6F00620075006E` `0xF5A367E2`\n\nGet directory list (dir) `0x02` `0x75007300740065` `0x24E430BD`\n\nGet directory tree `0x03` `0x70007200640064` `0xBA8F85C7`\n\nCompress and upload a file `0x04` `0x64006500730063` `0x987ADC57`\n(LZ4)\n\nDownload and decompress a file `0x05` `0x73007500620069` `0xBF2979EEi64`\n(LZ4)\n\nCompress a folder recursively (prefix of the `0x06` `0x6400650073007A` `0xC70C64BB`\ntemporary output and the algorithm in brackets) (TPK, LZ4) (TMP, ZIP) (TMP, ZIP)\n\nDelete file securely `0x07` `0x6C0069006D0070` `0xC0DC3219`\n\nGet process info (tasklist) `0x08` `0x76006900700072` `0x80A00A8F`\n\nTerminate a process by PID `0x09` `0x7000720064006D` `0xFCD96BAE`\n\nCreate process and collect output `0x0A` `0x6C00ED00640063` `0xFAA62957`\n\nCreate/open an event `0x0E` `0x63006F006D0065` `0x16104DA7`\n\nSet file times as the source (in brackets) `0xF` `0x74006900640061` `0xFDF50A87`\n(kernel32.dll) (wininet.dll) (msconfig.exe)\n\nSet current directory `0x10` `0x63006100640069` `0xD443E3DF`\n\nUpdate the encrypted configuration on the file system `0x11` `0x6500730063006F` `0x297B5E45`\n(byte size and cipher in brackets) `0x12` `0x64006F0072006D` `0x9E0A387B`\n\n(6398, AES-256) (6816, RC4) (7824, RC4)\n\nCreate a new process `0x13` `0x63006F00720072` `0xE461424B`\n\nCreate a new process as a user `0x14` `0x63006F00630073` `0x7DE16DD7`\n\nExecute an MZ file in a console or as a remote thread `0x15` `0x69006E00640070` `0xDD221747`\n\nInject and execute an MZ file into a process (by PID) `0x16` `0x69006E00790069` N/A\nas a new remote thread\n\nDecrypt, inject, and execute shellcode into a `0x17` `0x69006E00790065` `0xFCD8FF01`\n```\nexplorer.exe process as a new remote thread\n\n```\nOpen a TCP connection N/A `0x70007200640063` `0xB10B015E`\n\nUninstall self N/A `0x6D006F00720069` N/A\n\nDownload a file and write it to the file system N/A `0x73007500620069` `0xBF2979EE`\n\n_Table 10: A comparison of commands among variants of BackbitingTea and SecondHandTea._\n\n|Functionality|SecondHandTea|BackbitingTea Canada|BackbitingTea USA|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Get system info|0x00|0x6F00620069006E|0xE2FCD92E|\n|Get disk info|0x01|0x6F00620075006E|0xF5A367E2|\n|Get directory list (dir)|0x02|0x75007300740065|0x24E430BD|\n|Get directory tree|0x03|0x70007200640064|0xBA8F85C7|\n|Compress and upload a file|0x04 (LZ4)|0x64006500730063|0x987ADC57|\n|Download and decompress a file|0x05 (LZ4)|0x73007500620069|0xBF2979EEi64|\n|Compress a folder recursively (prefix of the temporary output and the algorithm in brackets)|0x06 (TPK, LZ4)|0x6400650073007A (TMP, ZIP)|0xC70C64BB (TMP, ZIP)|\n|Delete file securely|0x07|0x6C0069006D0070|0xC0DC3219|\n|Get process info (tasklist)|0x08|0x76006900700072|0x80A00A8F|\n|Terminate a process by PID|0x09|0x7000720064006D|0xFCD96BAE|\n|Create process and collect output|0x0A|0x6C00ED00640063|0xFAA62957|\n|Create/open an event|0x0E|0x63006F006D0065|0x16104DA7|\n|Set file times as the source (in brackets)|0xF (kernel32.dll)|0x74006900640061 (wininet.dll)|0xFDF50A87 (msconfig.exe)|\n|Set current directory|0x10|0x63006100640069|0xD443E3DF|\n|Update the encrypted configuration on the file system (byte size and cipher in brackets)|0x11 0x12 (6398, AES-256)|0x6500730063006F 0x64006F0072006D (6816, RC4)|0x297B5E45 0x9E0A387B (7824, RC4)|\n|Create a new process|0x13|0x63006F00720072|0xE461424B|\n|Create a new process as a user|0x14|0x63006F00630073|0x7DE16DD7|\n|Execute an MZ file in a console or as a remote thread|0x15|0x69006E00640070|0xDD221747|\n|Inject and execute an MZ file into a process (by PID) as a new remote thread|0x16|0x69006E00790069|N/A|\n|Decrypt, inject, and execute shellcode into a explorer.exe process as a new remote thread|0x17|0x69006E00790065|0xFCD8FF01|\n|Open a TCP connection|N/A|0x70007200640063|0xB10B015E|\n|Uninstall self|N/A|0x6D006F00720069|N/A|\n|Download a file and write it to the file system|N/A|0x73007500620069|0xBF2979EE|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe names of configuration files are hard-coded in the binaries.

To distinguish between the activity and the backdoor (a full-featured RAT), we added the\npreferred suffix -Tea.\n\nWe observed an updated version of ThreatNeedleTea deployed against South Korean targets in Q1 2022. It replaced RC4\nfor encryption of network data with either a single-byte XOR key or the ChaCha20 cipher. The RAT supports the usual set\nof commands that are sorted in a function table; see Figure 10.\n\n_Figure 10: Commands supported by the new ThreatNeedleTea. Execution where the output is sent back to the C&C server_\n_is a typical supported command in many Lazarus payloads._\n\nThreatNeedleTea fingerprints the system for information like hostname, architecture, computer name, Windows product\nname, and physical address (the last can be printed by running Get-NetAdapter -Name * -Physical | Select\n```\nMacAddress in PowerShell). The following is an example of data sent to the C&C server:\n   |x64|Wininet : 1_exe : Core|MSEDGEWIN10|Windows 10 Enterprise|2|00-0C-29-AC-74-05\n\n```\nInterestingly, an older version of ThreatNeedleTea contains a test command indexed by the number 13. It just sends a\nformatted message, ‘Recv Msg : OK’, back to the server (shown in Figure 11). It may be the same command with void\nfunctionality at index 17 in the new ThreatNeedleTea: see Figure 10. This particular string is similar to a function name\nused in SimpleTea for macOS and Linux; see [32], Table 1 (the RecvMsg command of BADCALL for Linux).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: Command 0013 in the old ThreatNeedleTea with a familiar string observed in SimpleTea._\n\n**_ScoringMathTea_**\n\nScoringMathTea is a complex RAT that supports 40 commands sorted in a function table, in the same style as\nThreatNeedleTea. The implemented functionality is the usual required by Lazarus: manipulation of files and processes,\nexchanging the configuration, collecting the victim’s system info, opening a TCP connection, and executing local\ncommands or new payloads downloaded from the C&C server. Some of the hard-coded character strings of\nScoringMathTea are shown in Figure 12. A format of a DLL export that is executed by one of the commands is highlighted.\n\nIt does hash-based dynamic Windows API resolution of the required functions, instead of the usual resolution of all the\nfunctions at the beginning of runtime. The algorithm used for the hash calculation is a modified Justin Sobel bitwise\nchecksum (instead of 1315423911, the constant 47954261 is used). For example, 0x61EC1D82 resolves to\n```\nkernel32!CreateFileW and 0x58443E2C to ws2_32!socket.\n\n```\n_Figure 12: Some of the character strings of ScoringMathTea. The highlighted one is the format of an exported function of_\n_an additional stage._\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe goal of this study is to provide a high-level perspective on Lazarus, mainly as seen by ESET telemetry during the last\ntwo years. The group is suitably considered as one of today’s most active threat actors, spreading its attacks globally. From\n\n\n-----\n\nthe variety of the TTPs, campaigns and tools, it seems there must be a large number of cooperating people whose work\nmanifests as the group’s activity, including the development and testing of an enormous toolset of droppers, loaders, and\nclient-server pairs; hacking weak webservers for C&C infrastructure; vulnerability research; completing complex tasks like\nacquiring valid code-signing certificates and robust evasion of security products; and related stealthy work, like monetizing\nillegal access and laundering the obtained funds and cryptocurrencies. Almost certainly there is additional hidden work that\nhasn’t yet manifested, as inevitably only a limited part of ‘the iceberg’ has been revealed, and is revealable, by available\nmeans. Lazarus is undoubtedly very well organized and continues to be a significant threat in cyberspace.\n\n**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**\n\nWe thank Dominik Breitenbacher for participating in this research.
