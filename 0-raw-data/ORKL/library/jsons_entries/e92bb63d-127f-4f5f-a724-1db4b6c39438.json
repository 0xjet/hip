It has been the subject of many analysis reports, including those**\n**[describing targeted espionage campaigns like Operation Night Dragon and the GhostNet](http://www.mcafee.com/in/resources/white-papers/foundstone/wp-know-your-digital-enemy.pdf)**\n**attacks on Tibet. Musical Chairs is a multi-year campaign which recently deployed a new**\n**variant Gh0st we’ve named “Piano Gh0st.”**\n\n**Our evidence suggests the actors behind these attacks have been operating for over five�**\n**years and have maintained a single command and control server for almost two. They use**\n**compromised e-mail accounts to distribute their malware widely and their targeting appears**\n**opportunistic rather than specific.�**\n\n**The overall motivation of this campaign is unclear at this time. Gh0st is very versatile as it**\n**allows an adversary to take complete control over the infected system including installing**\n**additional malware.**\n\n### Tracking the Gh0st\n\n**[Using Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus we have identified Gh0st variants associated with�](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/subscriptions/autofocus.html)**\n**Musical Chairs leading back to mid 2013. The source code and building tools for Gh0st are**\n**available freely on the web; anyone who is so inclined can build their own version of the**\n**malware. The way researchers differentiate between most variants is based on their “magic�**\n**tag.”**\n\n**Gh0st uses a custom TCP protocol to connect to a command and control (C2) server and**\n**retrieve instructions from the attacker. The malware identifies itself to the server by sending a�**\n**string of characters (the magic tag), which the server repeats back to confirm the connection�**\n**(See Figure 1.)**\n\n**In the original version this string was “Gh0st” but in subsequent versions many different�**\n**strings are used. These strings, along with the actual location of the command and control**\n\n\n-----\n\n**samples that were connected based on these tags.**\n\n**Figure 1. Gh0st “magic tag” value sent over custom TCP protocol**\n\n**Using these tags in the network traffic, the command and control infrastructure and other�**\n**characteristics of the attacks, we have grouped together a series of attacks into the one**\n**campaign, named Musical Chairs.**\n\n**The functionality of Gh0stRat (3.6) is well documented by multiple sources and is summarized**\n**below:**\n\n**Keylogging**\n**Remote terminal access**\n**Remote audio and video access**\n**File management**\n**Remote file download and execution�**\n**Process explorer and additional system enumeration capabilities**\n**GUI interaction (remote control)**\n**Self Update**\n**Reset of SSDT to remove existing hooks**\n\n### Spreading the Gh0st\n\n**The Gh0st variants used in the Musical Chairs campaign are distributed using phishing e-**\n**mails. The threat actors behind the attacks use a “shotgun” approach, blasting e-mails to as**\n**many recipients as possible in hopes of tricking a small percentage of targets into opening**\n**the attack. The attackers generally do not rely upon any vulnerability exploitation, and instead**\n**rely on the user to open the attached executable to compromise their system. Additionally,**\n**the phishing messages are sent from US-based residential ISP e-mail addresses. The**\n**accounts themselves appear to be legitimate, and are likely also compromised by this actor.**\n**In many cases the phishing e-mails are sent indiscriminately to all e-mail addresses in an**\n**infected user’s address book, including “no-reply” addresses a human operator would know**\n**to ignore.**\n\n**While Gh0st itself does not have built in e-mailing components, it is also possible that an**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Musical Chairs campaign:**\n\n**“Pleasantly Surprised.exe”**\n**“Beautiful Girls.exe”**\n**“Sexy Girls.exe”**\n**“gift card.exe”**\n**“amazon gift card.pdf.exe”**\n\n**The subject of the e-mails carrying these files typically matches the filename itself and does�**\n**not contain any sophisticated attempts at social engineering. The attacks detected thus far by**\n**[Palo Alto Networks WildFire have been exclusively in the United States and do not appear to](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/technologies/wildfire.html)**\n**target any particular industry.**\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n**The infrastructure used in Musical Chairs stands out primarily due to its longevity and use of**\n**multiple Gh0st command servers on the same host. At the center of the infrastructure for the**\n**last two years is a Windows 2003 server using the IP address 98.126.67.114. The server uses**\n**a US-based IP address, but displays a Chinese language interface for Remote Desktop**\n**connections.**\n\n**Figure 2. Chinese language Windows Server 2003 login banner on Gh0st C2**\n\n**Thus far Unit 42 has identified 32 different Gh0st samples connecting to this server dating�**\n**back to July of 2013. The Gh0st C2 software operates on Windows and allows the attacker to**\n**specify which port it should listen on for connections from infected systems. The attacker**\n**may host multiple Gh0st C2s on this server at one time, or may change the hosting TCP port**\n**very frequently. The 32 samples we have identified connect to 19 different TCP ports.�**\n\n**First Seen** **Gh0st TCP Port**\n\n**7/18/13** **10003**\n\n**9/4/13** **10009**\n\n**9/4/13** **10008**\n\n**9/14/13** **10004**\n\n|very frequently.|The 32 samples we have ide|\n|---|---|\n|First Seen|Gh0st TCP Port|\n|7/18/13|10003|\n|9/4/13|10009|\n|9/4/13|10008|\n\n\n-----\n\n|10/15/13|10004|\n|---|---|\n|11/21/13|20004|\n|11/28/13|20001|\n|1/2/14|40000|\n|1/2/14|40000|\n|1/9/14|20004|\n|1/29/14|10008|\n|3/17/14|30001|\n|4/17/14|8001|\n|4/22/14|8001|\n|7/14/14|10005|\n|8/18/14|8003|\n|9/10/14|9000|\n|9/19/14|9000|\n|10/27/14|10006|\n|2/20/15|9001|\n|3/24/15|600|\n|7/13/15|200|\n|7/15/15|200|\n|7/15/15|200|\n|7/17/15|200|\n|7/21/15|200|\n|7/21/15|201|\n|7/22/15|201|\n|7/29/15|201|\n|8/10/15|203|\n|8/18/15|204|\n|8/20/15|204|\n\n\n**While 98.126.67.114 is the longest standing command and control server, it is not the only**\n**server used by Musical Chairs. The malware typically finds this server using a domain that is�**\n**registered by the attacker and the registration information used by these C2 domains has**\n**allowed us to identify additional infrastructure used in these attacks.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3. Diagram of relationships between Musical Chairs C2 domains and related**\n\n**infrastructure**\n\n**These many related domains put the approximate start date of this campaign in 2010. The**\n**earliest versions of the attacks we’ve found are still visible in e-mail groups and public**\n**Facebook postings. Figure 4 shows an e-mail with the subject “my girlfriend’s self-view**\n**video” that contains a link to an executable hosted on nvzm.info, one of the domains**\n**associated with the Musical Chairs infrastructure.**\n\n**Figure 4. Screenshot of e-mail linking to nvzm[.]info using a “self-view video” theme.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5. Screenshot of Facebook posting including a different “video” theme.�**\n\n**Finally, we located a user who posted to the Gmail Help forum in 2010 requesting assistance**\n**with ridding their system of malware. He states that all of his contacts received one of the**\n**“self-view” phishing e-mails after his system was compromised.**\n\n**Figure 6. Screenshot of request on Gmail help forums related to “self-view” video e-mails.**\n\n**While we have not been able to identify the specific malware used to distribute these spam�**\n**messages, the infrastructure and the themes used in the e-mails connect them directly back**\n**to Musical Chairs happening this year.**\n\n### Piano Gh0st\n\n**In July, Musical Chairs began deploying a new variant of Gh0st, which we’ve named “Piano**\n**Gh0st.” This variant uses a new wrapper file to hide the Gh0st payload. The files are�**\n**delivered as a self-extracting executable (SFW) that acts as the dropper. It is responsible for**\n**extracting its payload to “c:\\microsoft\\lib\\ke\\Piano.dll” and executes the “mystart” function**\n**within the DLL’s export address table (EAT) using rundll32.exe.**\n\n**Figure 7. Screenshot of calls observed by Palo Alto Wildfire from within the AutoFocus�**\n\n**interface.**\n\n**The “Piano.dll” file itself has very little functionality other than decrypting, loading and running�**\n**an embedded DLL. It decrypts the embedded DLL using the Blowfish symmetric cipher with a�**\n**simple key consisting of the character “y”. “Piano.dll” proceeds to load the newly decrypted**\n**DLL manually and calls the exported function “my start”. The decrypted DLL has the following**\n**attributes:**\n\n**MD5: 8182a33cc1268c0c3b4e3d9a02d912c9**\n\n**S**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Size: 148008 bytes**\n\n**Imphash: 9c01d71c9bf78d231a313c86540e284c**\n\n**Compiled: 2015-07-14 02:11:32**\n\n**Exports:**\n\n**(0x123f0) mystart**\n\n**This embedded DLL is the actor Gh0stRat Trojan, specifically version 3.6. The following�**\n**debugging path is found within the DLL, which suggests the individual who compiled this DLL**\n**has a Chinese language pack (GB2312 specifically) installed:�**\n\n**C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\��\\GetRawInputData_dlll�����_win7bug�_**\n**����_Mutext_LSPlayer_20150708\\gh0st3.6\\Server\\svchost\\Release\\**\n\n**The Trojan maintaings persistence on the infected system by creating an entry in the registry**\n**at “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” with the key “nvidiake” and**\n**value “c:\\microsoft\\lib\\ke\\vv.js”, as seen in Figure 8.**\n\n**Figure 8. AutoFocus view of registry key modifications made by Piano Gh0st to maintain�**\n\n**persistence through system reboots**\n\n**The file “vv.js” in the registry key is a simple one-line JavaScript that executes the “vvv.bat”�**\n**file, as seen in the following:�**\n\n\n**1** **new** **ActiveXObject('Wscript.Shell').Run('cmd /c c:\\\\microsoft\\\\lib\\\\ke\\\\vvv.bat',0);**\n\n\n**The ‘vvv.bat’ file is a batch file that executes the Piano.dll payload in the same way as the�**\n**initial dropper, using “rundll32.exe” to call the “mystart” exported function, as seen in the**\n**following:**\n\n\n**1** **rundll32.exe** **c:\\microsoft\\lib\\ke\\Piano.dll mystart**\n\n\n**After setting up the registry keys for persistence, the Gh0stRat sample begins communicating**\n**with its command and control server using a custom network protocol. The magic tag used**\n**by this version of Gh0st is “clarkclar1” as seen in Figure 9. This variant also communicated**\n**with a command and control server using the domain www.meitanjiaoyiwang[.]com, which is**\n**hosted by 98.126.67.114 on tcp port 200.**\n\n**Figure 9.
