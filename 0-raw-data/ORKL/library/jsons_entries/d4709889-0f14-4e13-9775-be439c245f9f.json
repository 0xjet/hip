The\ntargets are Kurdish and Turkish natives, and ISIS supporters, all Iranian citizens.\n\nThe data collected by Domestic Kitten from compromised phones includes a wealth of\ninformation, as detailed below:\n\ncontact lists\ncall records\ntext and multimedia messages\nbrowser history and bookmarks\ngeographical location\nphotos\nrecordings of nearby conversations\nlist of installed apps\n\n\n-----\n\nclipboard content\ndata on external storage\n\nMalicious code steals clipboard content\n\n## The operation may be active since 2016\n\nThe threat actor uses three mobile applications that are of interest to the potential victims: a\nwallpaper changer, an app purporting to offer news updates from ANF (a legitimate Kurdish\nnews website), and a fake version of the Vidogram messaging app.\n\nThe wallpaper changer is designed to lure victims by offering them ISIS-related pictures to\nset as the screen background.\n\n\n-----\n\nWallpaper changer app\nThe certificate used for signing all three apps, a requirement installing them on an Android\ndevice, was issued in 2016. This suggests that the campaign escaped detection for two\nyears.\n\nTo exfiltrate data from a compromised device the apps use HTTP POST requests to the\ncommand and control (C2) server available at newly registered domains.\n\nOne of the apps also contacts a website (firmwaresystemupdate[.]com) that resolved to an\nIranian IP address initially but changed to a Russian address.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll data delivered to the C2 is encrypted with the AES algorithm and can be decrypted with\na device ID the attacker creates for each victim.\n\n## Domestic Kitten Makes Thousands of Collateral Victims\n\nCheckPoint's analysis shows that 240 users have fallen victim to operation Domestic Kitten.\nMore than 97% of them are Iranians, the rest being victims in Afghanistan, Iraq and Great\nBritain.\n\nHowever, due to the comprehensive nature of the surveillance of the campaign, private\ninformation of thousands of individuals has been compromised.\n\nThey are not necessarily the object of the surveillance, but collateral victims whose details\nwere leaked from contact lists or conversations with the targets.\n\n## Clues point to state-backed Iranian APT\n\nIn a report shared with BleepingComputer, the researchers say that the operator of\nDomestic Kitten remains unconfirmed, but based on the political conditions in the region\nthey believe Iranian government entities are behind it.\n\n\"Indeed, these surveillance programs are used against individuals and groups that could\npose a threat to the stability of the Iranian regime. These could include internal dissidents\nand opposition forces, as well as ISIS advocates and the Kurdish minority settled mainly in\nWestern Iran,\" CheckPoint explains.\n\nThey say that the nature of the targets, the apps and the attack infrastructure are clues that\nsupport the theory of an Iranian origin.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Chinese ‘Space Pirates’ are hacking Russian aerospace firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-space-pirates-are-hacking-russian-aerospace-firms/)\n\n[Bitter cyberspies target South Asian govts with new malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitter-cyberspies-target-south-asian-govts-with-new-malware/)\n\n[Hackers are now hiding malware in Windows Event Logs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-are-now-hiding-malware-in-windows-event-logs/)\n\n[Google: Chinese state hackers keep targeting Russian govt agencies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chinese-state-hackers-keep-targeting-russian-govt-agencies/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
