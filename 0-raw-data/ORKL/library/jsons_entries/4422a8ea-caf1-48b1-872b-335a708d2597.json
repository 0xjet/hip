INTRODUCTION\n\n1. Plaintiff MICROSOFT CORP. (\"Microsoft\") hereby complains and alleges that\n\nJOHN DOES 1-2 (collectively \"Defendants\"), have established an Internet-based cyber-theft\n\noperation referred to as \"Barium.\" Through Barium, Defendants are engaged in breaking into the\n\nMicrosoftaccountsand computernetworks of Microsoft's customersand stealinghighly sensitive\n\ninformation. To manage and direct Barium, Defendants have establishedand operate a network\n\n###### of websites, domainsand computers on the Internet, which they use to target their victims, infect\n\ntheir computing devices, compromise the security of their networks, and steal sensitive\n\n###### information. Accounts and profiles usedby Defendants on certainpublicly accessible websites to\n\noperate Barium are set forth at Appendix A and are referred to as the \"Barium Profiles.\" Internet\n\n###### domains used by Defendants to operate Barium aresetforth at AppendixBto this Complaint and\n\n arereferred to asthe \"Barium Command and Control Domains.\" Microsoft alleges as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nII. NATURE OF ACTION\n\n2. This is an action based upon: (1) The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030;\n\n(2) Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701; (3) Trademark Infringement under\n\nthe Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114 et seq.

Microsoft seeks injunctive and other equitable relief\n\nand damages against Defendants who operate and control a network of computers that include the\n\nBarium Profiles and the Barium Command and Control Domains. Defendants, through their illegal\n\nactivities involving Barium, have caused and continue to cause irreparable injury to Microsoft, its\n\ncustomers and licensees, and the public.\n\nIII. PARTIES\n\n3. PlaintiffMicrosoft is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State\n\nof Washington, having its headquarters and principal place of business in Redmond, Washington.\n\n4. On information and belief, the Defendants control the Barium Profiles and the Barium\n\nCommand and Control Domains in ftirtherance of conduct designed to cause harm to Microsoft,\n\nits customers and licensees, and the public. Microsoft is informed and believes and thereupon\n\nalleges that Defendants can likely be contacted directly or through third-parties using the\n\ninformation set forth in Appendix B.\n\n5. Third parties VeriSign, Inc., VeriSign Information Services, Inc., and VeriSign Global\n\n###### Registry Services (collectively, \"VeriSign\") maintain the domain name registry that oversee the\n\n registration ofall domain names ending in\".com.\" VeriSign Information Services, Inc., VeriSign,\n\n Inc.andVeriSign Global Registry Services arelocated at 12061 Bluemont Way, Reston, Virginia\n\n20190.\n\n###### 6. Set forth in Appendix B is the identity of and contact information for the third-party\n\n domain registry that controls the domains usedby the Defendants.\n\n7. Set forth inAppendix A are the accounts and profiles that the Defendants use to operate\n\n\n-----\n\nand configure Barium malware.\n\n8. On information and belief, Defendantsjointly own, rent, lease, or otherwise have dominion\n\nover the Barium Profiles, the Barium Command and Control Domains, and related infrastructure,\n\nand through those control and operate Barium. Microsoft will amend this Complaint to allege the\n\nDefendants' true names and capacities when ascertained. Microsoft will exercise due diligence to\n\ndetermine Defendants' true names, capacities, and contact information, and to effect service upon\n\nthose Defendants.\n\n9. Microsoft is informed and believe and thereupon alleges that each ofthe fictitiously named\n\nDefendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged, and that Microsoft's\n\ninjuries as herein alleged were proximately caused by such Defendants.\n\n10. On information and belief, the actions and omissions alleged herein to have been\n\nundertaken by Defendants were actions that Defendants, and each ofthem, authorized, controlled,\n\ndirected, or had the ability to authorize, control or direct, and/or were actions and omissions each\n\nDefendant assisted, participated in, or otherwise encouraged, and are actions for which each\n\nDefendant is liable. Each Defendant aided and abetted the actions of Defendants set forth below,\n\nin that each Defendant had knowledge of those actions and omissions, provided assistance and\n\nbenefited fi-om those actions and omissions, in whole or in part. Each Defendant was the agent of\n\neach of the other Defendant, and in doing the things hereinafter alleged, was acting within the\n\ncourse and scope of such agency and with the permission and consent of other Defendant.\n\nIV. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n11. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331\n\nbecausethis action arises out of Defendants' violation of the FederalComputerFraud and Abuse\n\nAct (18 U.S.C. § 1030), Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. § 2701), and the\n\n###### Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 1125). The Court also has subject matterjurisdiction over\n\nMicrosoft's claims for trespass to chattels, unjust enrichment, conversion, and intentional\n\n###### interference with contractual relationships pursuantto 28 U.S.C. § 1367.\n\n 12. Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a\n\n\n-----\n\nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Microsoft's claims has occurred in this\n\njudicial district, because a substantial part of the property that is the subject of Microsoft's claims\n\nis situated in this judicial district, and because a substantial part of the harm caused by Defendants\n\nhas occurred in this judicial district. Defendants maintain Internet domains registered in Virginia,\n\nengage in other conduct availing themselves of the privilege of conducting business in Virginia,\n\nand have utilized instrumentalities located in Virginia and the Eastern District of Virginia to carry\n\nout the acts of which Microsoft complains.\n\n13. Defendants have affirmatively directed actions at Virginia and the Eastern District of\n\nVirginia by directing malicious computer code at the computing devices and high-value computer\n\nnetworks of individual users and entities located in Virginia and the Eastern District of Virginia,\n\nattempting to and in fact infecting those computing devices with malicious code to compromise\n\nthe security of those systems, and attempting to and in fact stealing sensitive information from\n\nthose networks, all to the grievous harm and injury of Microsoft, its customers and licensees, and\n\nthe public. Figure 1, below, depicts the geographical location of user computers in and around\n\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, against which Defendants are known to have directed fraudulent\n\nacts and malicious code, attempting to and in fact infecting those computers, thereby\n\ncompromising their security and subjecting them to theft of sensitive information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1\n\nOiUjod . 1\n\nMtlcon BnmtMick•$> En<©tt Cily-\\f I• ^^\\UlCM \\s«^,\n\n\\Oat*t DcnnOvHW\n\nPhHhspi PJrtom atttlaWarr edf                                - ,\n\n9 vnoi\n\nPclfttbufo                                               - tt ^ n                                               - /\n\nWoodttUk \"S5i«f*- lo« V MMod iv-i\\                                         - C»p'\n\nW«r«tM« 'Alei^ndnj\n\nCoocgttonfn\n\n0<U Oty\n/ SlC^uHet\n\nNatf^nut MAibom\nfOttfft H«rmonbum UP««U\nMofttcrty\n\n--S«tnbu/y\nOoMnOi\n\nUxmQton P»ni\n\nMctnvood M«tnton\n\nMontroii\n\nWAfmSpdngt Ch«Hcmrtvtft« Pa<oci}pl[« City\n\nMmcIow Bluff\n\nBucnaVlttA\n\ntinton Tuckiho#>Mr' Wttsto Stonamch\n\n                                                                     - R<timond\n\nlynchburg BonL•CC© —\"\"\"\n\n                                                                               - I\n\n«, B«dfo#d Hoprwrll ViSoflnfaurg\n\nUMlcsburg\n\nftuttburg OpwMr\n\nCm SprvM ts,W„ W.I\n\nCh«rtoCl«/ Court Komw OmmmUm Newport Ncm Hampton\nLuncnburg\n\nWolf Ttu tmponj „ r,«,l<lif, Suffolk VimRni BCKh\n\nMount Ally ?? u«.\n\nRcidivtOt\n\n14. Defendants maintain the Barium Command and Control Domains registered through\n\nVerisign, which resides in the Eastern District ofVirginia. Defendants use these domains to direct\n\nattacks against targeted networks, to infect computing devices connected to those networks that\n\npermit Defendants to compromise the security and conduct reconnaissance of and move latterly\n\nthrough those networks, and to locate and exfiltrate sensitive information from those networks.\n\nDefendants have undertaken the acts alleged herein with knowledge that such acts would cause\n\nharm through domains located in the Eastern District of Virginia, through the Barium Command\n\nand ControlDomainsmaintainedthroughfacilitiesin the EasternDistrict ofVirginia,and through\n\ncomputing devices and computer networks located in the Eastern District of Virginia, thereby\n\n###### injuring Microsoft, its customers and licensees, and others in the EasternDistrictof Virginiaand\n\n elsewhere in the United States. Therefore, this Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants.\n\n15. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b),venue is proper in thisjudicialdistrict. A substantial part\n\n\n-----\n\nof the events or omissions giving rise to Microsoft's claims, together with a substantial part of the\n\nproperty that is the subject of Microsoft's claims, are situated in this judicial district. Venue is\n\nproper in thisjudicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)because Defendants are subject to personal\n\njurisdiction in this judicial district.\n\nV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nA. Microsoft's Services And Reputation\n\n16. Microsoft® is a provider of the Windows® operating system and the Internet Explorer®\n\nweb browser, and a variety of other softAvare and services, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft\n\nPowerPoint, and cloud-based services offered in connection therewith. Microsoft has invested\n\nsubstantial resources in developing high-quality products and services. Due to the high quality\n\nand effectiveness of Microsoft's products and services and the expenditure of significant resources\n\nby Microsoft to market those products and services, Microsoft has generated substantial goodwill\n\nwith its customers, establishing a strong brand and developing the Microsoft name and the names\n\nof its products and services into strong and famous world-wide symbols that are well-recognized\n\nwithin its channels of trade. Microsoft has registered trademarks representing the quality of its\n\nproducts and services and its brand, including Microsoft, Windows, and Internet Explorer. Copies\n\nof the trademark registrations for the Microsoft, Windows, and Internet Explorer trademarks are\n\nattached as Appendix C to this Complaint.\n\nB. Barium\n\n17. Barium is highly sophisticated, well-resourced,organized, and patient. Barium specializes\n\nin targeting high value organizations holding sensitive data, by gathering extensive information\n\nabout their employees through publicly available information and social media, using that\n\n###### information to fashion phishing attacks intended to trickthoseemployees into compromising their\n\ncomputers and networks, compromising legitimate enterprise software provider's products not\n\nprotectedby antivirussoftware, anddisguising its activitiesusingthe namesofMicrosoftandother\n\nlegitimate companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nC. Barium's Tools\n\n18. Althoughthe Barium Defendants have relied on differentand distinct infrastructures in an\n\neffortto evade detection, Bariumused the same e-mailaddress(hostay88@gmail.com) to register\n\nmalicious domains used in connection with at least two toolsets that Barium has employed to\n\ncompromise victim computers. As shown in Figure 1, below, Barium registered the domains\n\nnott3ed.com and operatingbox.com using this e-mail address, and Barium also linked the same\n\ne-mail address to a Microsoft account (johnxl9@hotmail.com) that was used to create malicious\n\nprofiles on the Microsoft Forums website TechNet to configure the \"Barlaiy\" malware on victim\n\ncomputers (the Barlaiy malware is described in Part D.l, below).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1\n\nPhlshing Email\n\nBailaly Halwaie ShadowPad Maiwate\n\n                                   -\n\nBailalyPtolU« johnxl9ghotmall com Command & Con&oi\n\nop«tatinQbo> com nolp«dcom\n\n### @\n\nnostay88@gmatl.com\n\n\n-----\n\nD. Barium's Method Of Compromising And Stealing Information From Victims\n\n19. The Barium Defendants have employed at least two methods of compromising victim\n\ncomputers. The first method, described in Part D.l, below, involves the \"Barlaiy\" and \"PlugXL\"\n\nmalware, which the Barium Defendants propagate using phishing techniques. The second method,\n\ndescribed in Part D.2, below, involves the \"ShadowPad\" malware, which the Barium Defendants\n\nhave distributed via a third-party software provider's compromised update.\n\n1. Barium Method 1; \"Barlaiv** And \"PlugXL\" Malware\n\na. Barium Defendants Deliver ^^Barlaiy\" And 'TlugXL\" Malware\nUsing Phishing Attacks\n\n20. After selecting a victim organization. Barium will identify individuals employed by that\n\norganization and attempt to ascertain their personal or work e-mail addresses. To enhance the\n\neffectiveness of phishing attacks into the organization, Barium will collect additional background\n\ninformationfrom social media sites. Employing a technique known as \"spear phishing,\" Barium\n\nhas heavily targeted individualswithin Human Resources or BusinessDevelopmentdepartments\n\nof the targeted organizations in order to compromise the computers of such individuals.\n\n21. In a typical spear phishing attack. Barium sends the targeted individual an e-mail\n\nspecifically crafted to induce that individual to take some action that will lead to the compromise\n\nof their computer. Using the information gathered from its reconnaissance on social media sites,\n\nBarium packages the phishing e-mail in a way that gives the e-mail credibility to the target user,\n\noften by making the e-mail appear as if it were sent from an organization known to and trusted by\n\nthe victim or concerning a topic of interest to the victim. Barium uses the lure of a resume or\n\n###### documents relatedto a currentknownprojectthat the targetmay be developing.\n\n22. Figure 2 depicts an example of such a spear phishing e-mail directed to a potential victim\n\nwho is a customer and user of Microsoft's Hotmail e-mail service:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2\n\nJim Hugnes <jimhugnesx@gmail com: ke^hoBr.al.com I 5 IS 2016\n\nHil\nQ We removed extra line breaks from this message.\n\nproject documents.7z....\n\n134 KB\n\nHi,My name is Jim, Project Manager of this project.\nOur company looking for freelance developer to enhance and upgrade our application.\nPlease refer to the project requirements and details attached.

Lookingforward to your reply.\n\nThanks\n\nJim Hughes\n\nEm3il:Jimhughesx@gmall.com Skype:jimhughes\n\n23. In the phishing e-mails sent to victims by the Barium Defendants (often specifically\n\ntailored to the victim), there are file attachments or links that lead to malicious executable code.\n\nCompressed file archives such as \"7z,\" \"ACE\" and \"RAR\" file attachments are used to hide the\n\nmalicious code, which fhistrate automated e-mail malware detection. For instance, in the above\n\nexample phishing e-mail, a malicious archive entitled \"project documents.7z\" can be seen.\n\nBecause compressed file archives are not inherently malicious, these specific archives are able to\n\navoid network detection and deliver further malicious files, which are then used to deliver\n\nmalware. For example,Barium's archives may includeone or more of the following:\n\n                  - Windows Shortcut (.Ink) file with hidden payloads;\n\n                  - Windows Compiled HTML Help files (.chm);\n\n                   - Microsoft PowerPoint document with executable macro code;\n\n                   - Microsoft Word document with executable macro code; and/or\n\n                  - Microsoft Word document containingexploit code.\n\n24. Whenthe victimclickson one of these links or opens the files, it causesthe malwareto be\n\ninstalled on the victim's Windows-based computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nb. Operation Of \"Barlaiy\" and \"PlugXL\" Malware\n\n25. Barium Defendants install the malicious \"Win32/Barlaiy\" malware and the malicious\n\n\"Win32/PlugX.L\" malware on victim computers using the means described above. Both\n\nWin32/Barlaiy & Win32/PlugX.L are remote access \"trojans,\" which allow Barium to gather a\n\nvictim's information, control a victim's device, install additional malware, and exfiltrate\n\ninformation fi-om a victim's device.\n\n26. Barium Defendants install the malicious credential stealing and injection tool known as\n\n\"Win32/RibDoor.A!dha.\" This form of malicious executable software may be wrapped within a\n\ncustom dropper software known as \"RbDoor,\" which requires a command-line password to\n\nexecute the included malware, allowing the Barium Defendants to evade antivirus software and\n\nother threat-prevention tools utilized by Microsoft and its customers.\n\n27. In order to transmit stolen information to Barium and execute additional instructions, each\n\nofthese forms of malware needs to identify and communicate with external servers on the Internet\n\nfrom which the malware receives instructions and configuration files. These external servers with\n\nwhich the malware communicates are called Command and Control (\"C&C\") servers.\n\n28. Barium Defendants go to great lengths to conceal the identity and location of their C&C\n\nservers through the following means. The Barium Defendants configure their malware to\n\ncommunicate with fake website \"profile\" pages that the Defendants have already set up on social\n\nmedia websites, blog websites and forums, and publicly posted documents on other legitimate\n\nwebsites (although the specific profiles, posts, and documents published by Defendants are fake\n\nand malicious).\n\n29. Once installed on victims' computers, the malware is designed to reach out to these fake\n\nwebsite profiles and documents and search for particular text strings (pre-defined textual\n\n\"anchors\"), such as commentsor randomalphanumeric text, that can be decodedand read by the\n\n###### malware to obtainconfiguration files andthe IP addresses and ports of other C&C servers. Once\n\nthe malware decodes the text strings, it is able to connect to C&C servers from which it obtains\n\nadditional instructions and to which it sends stolen information.\n\n\n-----\n\n30. Barium uses this mechanism to conceal the IP addresses of C&C servers and evade\n\ndetection, as the general websites that are being reached out to are legitimate blog sites and social\n\nmedia sites which many users use for business or other legitimate purposes (although Defendants'\n\nspecific accounts and profiles on those websites are fake and malicious). This technique also\n\nenables the Barium Defendants to quickly and easily change the C&C servers, in an attempt to\n\nevade efforts by antivirus vendors and the cybersecurity community, as the malware is not limited\n\nto a particular set of C&C domains that are \"hard coded\" into the malware. In particular, the\n\nBarium Defendants create fake profiles and postings for this purpose on both Microsoft-branded\n\nwebsites as well as those of other well-known technology companies. The specific file paths of\n\nthese fake and malicious profiles include the URLs set forth on Appendix A of the Complaint.\n\n31. The table in Figure 3, below, is a sample list of such websites showing examples of the\n\n###### format ofthe encoded malware configuration files:'\n\nFigure 3\n\nWebsite URL Format\nMicrosoft's LinkedIn www. linkedin. com/in/<ActorControlledProfile>\n(professional social\nnetworking website)\n\nMicrosoft's Microsoft Social msdn. microsoft. com/Profile/<ActorControlledProfile>\nDeveloper Network (forum\nfor software developers)\n\nMicrosoft's TechNet (forum Social, technet. microsoft. com/Profde/<ActorControlledProfile>\nfor software developers)\n\nMicrosoft's Forums (forum) Social microsoft. com/Profde/<ActorControlledProfile>\nGoogle Docs (website) Docs, soosle. com/document/<ActorControlledDocument>\nGitHub (website) GitHub. com/<ActorControlledProiect>\n\n###### 32. As shown in Figure 4a, the Barium Defendants haveusedTechNet to createa fake profile\n\nfor a fake user. On the profile, the Barium Defendants included the text\n\n\"{OOarFJ9wgqvTVgqHln51ftme+25/}\" in the \"About Me\" section of the site. The malware\n\n###### installed on an infected computer searches this particular profile for the and\"}\" braces text.\n\n The Barium Defendants create fake profiles on non-Microsoft websites as well. Forexample, fake profiles for this purpose have been seen on the Dropbox, PasteBin, Google Docs, GitHub,\nFacebook, WordPress and Twitter websites.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the malware locates that text, it knows to read and decode the text between the braces in\n\n###### order to generate the IP address and port name of the C&C server that the malware ultimately\n\ncommunicates with to receive operational instructions and to send stolen information:\n\nFigure 4a\n\nMqilittt\n\nttazin •« iDStt cenM\nttnimsatf cinwaetq^ t>c« craiMtrm\n\nWihSZ/Barlaiy MatWare Cohfig:\n\n{OOarPJ9wgqvTVgqHIn51ftme4 2S/)\n\nOso^.Qsf'\npicfiitsni *56\n\nt I. \"A e liiCirteh\n\n..•4- r'\n\n., „• .\n\n33. Similarly, in example shovmin Figure 4b, the Barium Defendants have created a malicious\n\ndocument on the Google Docs website. In the document, Barium included the text\n\n\"{weLXWKq/6F£EsoAXVNPDNW0vmMXL}\".

Barium Method 2: ''ShadowPad\" Malware\n\na. Barium Defendants Use Third-Party Software Updates To\nDeliver \"ShadowPad\" Malware To Windows Users And\nCompromise Victim Computers\n\n35. In addition to using phishing tactics, Barium has also devised the following sophisticated\n\nscheme to target Microsoft customers. Barium compromised a legitimate company, NetSarang\n\nInc. (\"NetSarang\"), headquartered in South Korea with a United States subsidiary. NetSarang\n\nprovides enterprise level products that streamline data transfer over complex networks, including\n\nproducts designed to operate on the Microsoft Windows platform.\n\n36. The NetSarang products for Windows contain a type of file called a Dynamic Link Library\n\n(DLL) file, named \"nssock2.dll.\" Barium was able to compromise NetSarang's products by\n\nmodifying this legitimate DLL file and injecting two different bodies of malicious code into the\n\nfile, each heavily encrypted with advanced algorithms in order to conceal their purpose. The\n\naddition of malicious code causes a change to the file size—the original file size of the legitimate\n\nDLL file was 114896 bytes, but the modified, malicious DLL file, including extra malicious code,\n\nis 180432 bytes. Figure 5 depicts these file changes made by Barium:\n\nFigure 5\n\nOriginal DLL Infected DLL\n\nDigital Signature Encrvpted Body\n\nDigital Signature\n\n\n-----\n\n37. The Barium Defendants inserted the modified, malicious file into the NetSarang build\n\nenvironment, where NetSarang creates the final versions of the software that are ultimately\n\ndelivered by NetSarang to Microsoft's customers. By signing the malicious DLL files with\n\nNetSarang's private certificate. Barium included the modified, malicious DLL file in routine\n\nsoftware updates for NetSarang products distributed to Windows users that would appear to be a\n\nlegitimate file from NetSarang.\n\n38. Once the DLL file was included in the build, any enterprise using the affected NetSarang\n\nproducts and receiving updates would receive the Barium malicious file through the software\n\nupdate process. Barium injected the malicious file in five NetSarang products. Typically, a build\n\nenvironment is in a highly secured, controlled area with limited access.\n\n39. The Barium Defendants' ability to accomplish this demonstrates their technical and\n\noperational sophistication. While not detected at the time, Microsoft's antivirus and security\n\nproducts now detect this Barium malicious file and flag the file as \"Win32/ShadowPad.A\". This\n\nparticular Barium-modified malicious file is referred to as \"ShadowPad\" malware throughout.\n\nb. Operation of \"ShadowPad\" Malware\n\n40. This ShadowPad malware utilizes a two-stage method to do harm. ShadowPad Stage 1\n\nmalware utilizes the capability of the Microsoft programing language C-H- runtime to invoke\n\nautomatically, meaning the malware will initialize without requiring any action by the victim. This\n\nmethod makes the ShadowPad Stage 1 malware less noticeable and difficult for any antivirus\n\nsoftware to detect. ShadowPad Stage 1 malware runs continuously after its initial execution and\n\nattempts to access a Windows registry path that is unique to each victim in order to give the\n\ninfected device a persistent identifier.\n\n41. ShadowPad Stage 1 malware identifies and communicates with C&C servers utilizing a\n\ncomplex custom algorithm. The malware leverages a Domain Generation Algorithm (\"DGA\") to\n\ngenerate a unique Internet domain, based on month and year of the date set on the victim machine.\n\n###### Theinfected computer reaches outforinstructions to theseC&C domains. Thiscapability enables\n\nShadowPad Stage 1 malwareto generatea new C&Cdomaineverymonth. Microsofthas reverse\n\n\n-----\n\n###### engineered the DGAand generated the C&Cdomains leveraged by ShadowPad Stage 1malware.\n\nThese C&C domains include those listed in Appendix B of the Complaint.\n\n42. ShadowPad leveragesdomain registrar QHoster to register these Stage 1 C&C domains.\n\nTypically, in order to register a domain name, the registrant must provide identifying and contact\n\ninformation, including the registrant's full name, postal address, e-mail address, phone number,\n\nadministrative contact details, and technical contact details. This information is often referred to\n\nas \"WHOIS\" data.\n\n43. WHOIS data is managed by the registrar with which a domain is registered and, by default,\n\nis publicly available in order to enable the identification and to provide contact information for the\n\ndomain owner. However, registrars may also offer a service called \"Privacy Protection.\" This\n\nservice enables a registrant to remove from public view the WHOIS data used to register the\n\ndomain and replaces it with generic information, typically for a proxy entity. All ofthe ShadowPad\n\nStage 1 malware domains are registered using the Privacy Protection service that is provided by\n\nQHoster. Figure 6 shows the difference between the normal WHOIS data for a domain and the\n\n###### Privacy Protection WHOIS data for a domain, as marketed by QHoster.^ Inthe normal WHOIS\n\ndata, the real address and e-mail address for the owner of the domain \"jsmithprod.com\" can be\n\nseen. However, in the privacy protected WHOIS information,only generic information is listed\n\nfor that domain, including a general mailing address and random e-mail address. The Privacy\n\nProtection service is not inherently malicious in nature, but the pattern of utilizing the service is\n\nconsistent with C&C domains leveraged by the ShadowPad malware.\n\nSee DomainName Registration.QHoster,httDs://www.ahoster.com/domains.html (last visited Oct. 25, 2017).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6\n\n# /k Unprotect WHOIS 1 Mm Protected with ID Protect\n(Umm John Smith Productions I 35 Whois Privacy Protection Service\nJohn Smith 1 Whois Agent\n12Main St 1 PHB 368.14150 NE 20th St-FI\nHollister, CA 95023 1 C/0 johnsmithprod.com\nUnited States 1 Bellevue, WA 98007\n(555)555-1234 1 United States\njohnsmith@jsmithprod.com H (425)274-0657\ngmyjcxkxh@whois privacyprotectcom\nYour information is visible to the public!             -\n\n44. ShadowPad Stage 1 malware does not communicate to the C&C server directly. Instead,\n\nShadowPad Stage 1 malware sends information and receives C&C instructions via the Domain\n\nName System (\"DNS\") protocol. The DNS protocol is a set of processes and servers that tell a\n\ncomputer attempting to visit a particular Internet domain how to resolve a request for that particular\n\ndomain and where to find the servers on the Internet for content associated with that domain.\n\n45. ShadowPad Stage 1 malware first attempts to perform a customized domain lookup for a\n\ngiven C&C domain. It does so by doing a \"lookup\" ofthe C&C domain using public DNS servers\n\nwith the following IP addresses: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4,4.2.2.1, and 4.2.2.2. Ifthe Domain Name lookup\n\nfor the C&C domainfails, then the ShadowPadStage 1malwareperforms a DomainName lookup\n\nusing the DNS lookupfacilitiesthat are present locallyon the victim device. Bariummay be using\n\nthe public DNS servers for the first lookup attempt in an effort to avoid either local logging or\n\nwhitelisting, but if the public DNS servers are not available. Barium's malware will default back\n\nto the local DNS servers in order to communicate with the C&C domain.\n\n###### 46. ShadowPad Stage 1 malware collects the User Name, Machine Name (or \"Hostname\"),\n\n and Domain Name of the victim device, and this information is first encrypted using a custom\n\n\n-----\n\n###### algorithm and then communicated to the C&C infrastructure viathe DNS TXT record.^\n\n47. ShadowPad Stage 1 malware explicitly uses DNS TXT records to communicate\n\ninformation from the victim's computer to Barium and to deliver instructions to the victim's\n\ncomputer. The initial information transmitted over this DNS protocol channel contains key\n\nproperties of the victim's computer, allowing the Barium Defendants to understand the victim's\n\nsystem and the domain that the victim has joined. This domain information, for example, reflects\n\nwhich companies' computers are infected and are now Barium victims.\n\n48. Below, at Figure 7, is an example of the encrypted information sent in the DNS TXT\n\nrecord. In particular, a portion of an Internet domain called a \"sub-domain\" is stored in the DNS\n\nTXT record, and that sub-domain is encoded with the encrypted User Name, Machine Name (or\n\n\"Hostname\"), and Domain Name of the victim device. The C&C domain is the last portion of the\n\nwebsite address at the end of the domain path (\"foryzedensrcd.com\" indicated in black text in\n\nFigure 7, below). The sub-domain, in which data is encrypted and stored in a DNS TXT record,\n\nis the portion of the domain at the beginning of the domain path (the text highlighted in blue in\n\nFigure 7, below).\n\n^A\"DNSTXT\" record works as follows. Typically, the DNS protocol contains information in various forms of\nrecords associatedwith a given Internetdomain. For example, a DNS \"A\" record liststhe IP address of the server\ncontaining the content associated with the domain, and an \"MX\" record reflects information about an e-mail server\non the domain. A \"DNS TXT\" record is a type of record associated with a domain in which free-form, human\nreadable text informationmay be stored describingsome attributeof the domain. DNS TXT records can be usedto\nrecord and deliver information about a domain.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7\n\nUser name:\n\nAdministrator\n\nHo^name:\n\nDomain:\n\nROOD\n\ncom\n\n49. Below, at Figure 8, is an example of a decoded DNS query, where the data encoded into a\n\nsub-domain is recovered by the Defendants and can then be used by the Barium Defendants. In\n\nparticular, in this example, custom data unique to the malware is captured followed by the name\n\nof the machine (\"ANDREA_XX\"), the victim's usemame (\"Administrator\"), and the company's\n\ndomain (\"ROOD\"). This information is collected to identify which companies have been\n\ninfiltrated by Barium and further analyzed in order for the Defendants to prioritize their Stage 2\n\nmalware attacks.\n\nFigure 8\n\n0008C288 00 00 52 4F 4F 44 bEiI0([0| ..ROOD 1\n0008C298 m 41 4E 44 52 45 41 5F 58 58 00 00 41 64 6D 69 .ANDREA_XX. .Admi\n0008C2A8 6E 69 73 74 72 61 74 6F 72 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 nistrator\n. i\n\n50. ShadowPad Stage 1 malware awaits for a correct DNS response: a custom encrypted\n\nresponsein a TXT record. A correctDNS responsecontainsa decryptionkey for the ShadowPad\n\n###### Stage2 malware and modulesassociated with the ShadowPad Stage 2 malware. The decryption\n\n\n-----\n\nkey in the DNS response would be utilized to activate ShadowPad Stage 2 malware. If the DNS\n\nresponse is incorrect,then the ShadowPadStage 1 attempts to reconnect after 8 hours.\n\n51. ShadowPad Stage 2 is modular, allowing Barium to customize the functionality of the\n\nmalware. These modules are encrypted and stored in the Windows registry. Configuration\n\nmodules (Config modules) contain backup C&C domains used to communicate with the Barium\n\nDefendants (for example, notped.com. described in Part D.2, above), and these backup C&C\n\ndomains can be changed as needed. Config modules enable Barium to be more agile in changing\n\ntheir infrastructure, as has been observed in previous Barium incidents. Thus far, the ShadowPad\n\nStage 2 modules identified are \"DNS,\" \"Install,\" \"Online,\" and \"Plugins\" modules, and analysis\n\nof these modules has identified the functionalities associated with them. ShadowPad Stage 2\n\nmodules can only be installed on the victim's computer if the ShadowPad Stage 1 malware is\n\nsuccessfully installed. Consequently, disrupting the Stage 1 infirastructure would halt further\n\ninfection of additional victims.\n\nE. Barium Defendants Steal Intellectual Property And Personal Information From\nCompromised Victim Computers\n\n52. Once the Barium Defendants have access to a victim computer through the malware\n\ndescribed above, they monitor the victim's activity and ultimately search for and steal sensitive\n\ndocuments (for example, exfiltration of intellectual property regarding technology has been seen),\n\nand personal information fi\"om the victim's network.\n\n53. In the process ofinfecting and taking over control of its victim's computers. Barium causes\n\ndamage to those computers and the Microsoft Windows operating system licensed by Microsoft\n\nto those computing device users. Barlaiy and ShadowPad are unique to the Barium Defendants.\n\n54. Barium uses a dropper to deploy ShadowPad malware, which eventually downloads other\n\nmodules. The following system registry hives are used by the ShadowPad malware:\n\n            - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\90368428\\Data\n\n            - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\90368428\\Data\n\n55. Additionally, Barlaiy malware makes changes to the system registry, also setting up and\n\n\n-----\n\nusing registry paths that use Microsoft trademarked names, including the following:\n\n            - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\n\n            - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Soflware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\n56. The installation of the Barium malware on a computing device essentially converts that\n\ncomputing device into a tool that Barium then uses to attack the computing device's owner and\n\nthe network to which the computing device is connected. The Barium backdoors are composed of\n\nseveral pieces with different functions, and the attacker can deploy a large set of tools to perform\n\ntasks including key logging, e-mail address and file harvesting, information gathering about the\n\nlocal computing devices, and remote communication with C&C servers.\n\nF. Barium Has Attacked Many Microsoft Customers In Virginia, The United\nStates, And Around The World\n\n57. Barium has targeted Microsoft customers both in Virginia, the United States, and around\n\nthe world. Figure 9a, below, shows detections of encounters with the Barium actors and their\n\ninfrastructure, including infected computers located in Virginia, and Figure 9b, below, shows\n\ndetections of encounters throughout the United States. Each detection indicates an instance at\n\nwhich one of Microsoft's Barium-specific signatures has been triggered. VeriSign, Inc., with\n\nheadquarters in Reston, Virginia, maintains the registry for domains used by Barium in connection\n\nwith their malware infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9a\n\nr V\n\nVDovw\n\nPMUppi Pjnom Ottawatr Bar\n\nPftcnburg ytiU\n\nOtntcKi Mittotd\n\nMononfBftHsCMwtk '»!

Mitigating Barium\n\nintrusions on customer networks is often extremely expensive. In typical cases where Microsoft's\n\nGlobal Incident Response and Recovery team supports an intrusion response related to Barium,\n\naverage costs can range from 250,000 to approximately 1.3 million dollars per incident, or more.\n\nThis does not includethe cost of new architecture, intrusionpreventiondevices,network security\n\nchangesto preventfuture intrusions, or the damagecausedby havingsensitiveinformationstolen.\n\n\n-----\n\n60. Barium irreparably harms Microsoft by damaging its reputation, brands, and customer\n\n###### goodwill. Microsoft is the providerof the Windows operating systemandthe TechNet service, as\n\nwell as a variety of other software and services. Microsoft is the owner of the \"Microsoft,\"\n\n\"Windows,\"and \"Internet Explorer\"trademarks at Appendix C to the Complaint. Microsofthas\n\ninvestedsubstantial resources in developing high-quality productsand services. Due to the high\n\nquality and effectiveness of Microsoft's products and services and the expenditureof significant\n\nresources by Microsoft to market those products and services, Microsoft has generated substantial\n\ngoodwill with its customers, has established a strong brand, and has developed the Microsoft name\n\nand the names of its products and services into strong and famous world-wide symbols that are\n\nwell-recognized within its channels oftrade. Microsoft has registered trademarks representing the\n\nquality of its products and servicesand its brand, includingthe trademarks listed above.\n\n61. The activities of the Barium Defendants injure Microsoft and its reputation, brand, and\n\ngoodwill. Users subject to the negative effects of the Barium Defendants' malicious applications\n\nand actions incorrectly believe that Microsoft is the source of vulnerabilities and resultant\n\nproblems. Software updating, also known as supply chain attacks, significantly threaten the\n\nMicrosoft ecosystem. Advice to customers to patch systems has been strongly advocated and\n\ncommunicated by Microsoft. The use of the supply chain attack vector, through software updates\n\n(discussed above in paragraphs 20-21), introduces a significant issue that appears to contradict\n\nMicrosoft's guidance and therefore irreparably injures Microsoft and its reputation, brand, and\n\ngoodwill.\n\nVI.
