    "plain_text": "## NEW BUGSLEEP BACKDOOR DEPLOYED IN RECENT MUDDYWATER CAMPAIGNS\n\nJuly 15, 2024\n\n\n# Key Findings\n\nMuddyWater, an Iranian threat group affiliated with the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), has\n\n[significantly increased its activities in Israel since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. This](https://www.gov.il/he/pages/alert_1745)\n\nparallels with activities against targets in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, India and Portugal.\n\nThe threat actors consistently use phishing campaigns sent from compromised organizational email accounts. The\n\nphishing campaigns typically lead to the deployment of legitimate Remote Management Tools (RMM) such as\n\nAtera Agent and Screen Connect.\n\nRecently, Muddy Water campaigns also led to the deployment of a new, previously undocumented tailor-made\n\nbackdoor we dubbed BugSleep, that is used to target organizations in Israel.\n\nBugSleep is a backdoor designed to execute the threat actors’ commands and transfer files between the\n\ncompromised machine and the C&C server. The backdoor is currently in development, with the threat actors\n\ncontinuously improving its functionality and addressing bugs.\n\n# Introduction\n\n\n-----\n\nactive since at least 2017. During the last year, MuddyWater engaged in widespread phishing campaigns targeting the\n\nMiddle East, with a particular focus on Israel. Since October 2023, the actors’ activities have increased significantly.\n\nTheir methods remain consistent, utilizing phishing campaigns sent from compromised email accounts targeting a wide\n\narray of organizations in countries of interest. These campaigns typically lead to the deployment of legitimate Remote\n\nManagement Tools (RMM) such as Atera Agent or Screen Connect. Recently, however, they have deployed a custom\n\nbackdoor we track as BugSleep.\n\nIn this report, we discuss the details of the most recent phishing campaigns and how they reflect the group’s interests. In\n\naddition, we provide an analysis of MuddyWater’s most recent techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) including the\n\nBugSleep custom backdoor and the abuse of Egnyte, a legitimate file-sharing service.\n\n# Emails and Lures\n\nMuddyWater campaigns usually consist of sending large numbers of emails to a wide range of targets from a\n\ncompromised email account. Although their lures are aimed at a large and varied set of organizations or individuals, they\n\noften focus on specific industries or sectors, highlighting the group’s points of interest. Among those are notable phishing\n\ncampaigns aimed at Israeli municipalities as well as a broader group of airlines, travel agencies, and journalists. Overall,\n\nsince February 2024 we identified over 50 spear phishing emails targeting more than 10 sectors that were sent to\n\nhundreds of recipients.\n\nFigure 1 – Notable phishing campaigns.\n\nIn each of these campaigns, the actors used a tailored lure that was sent to dozens of targets in the same sector. For\n\nexample, lures aimed at municipalities contained a suggestion to download a new app created just for municipalities:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 – Lure email sent to municipalities in Israel.\n\n**Translated email:**\n\nSubject: Special Offer: New App for Municipalities – Limited Time Only!\n\nDear Customer, in celebration of International Mother’s Day, we are excited to announce the\n\nlaunch of our latest municipal app. This innovative tool is meticulously designed to automate\n\ntasks, enhance efficiency, and ensure maximum safety in operations.\n\nFor today only, we are offering this app as a free download.

Download Now\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity to revolutionize your municipality’s operations with our\n\ninnovative solution. Don’t miss out!\n\nBest regards, [Redacted]\n\nIn more recent campaigns, the group shifted to more generic-themed, yet well-crafted phishing lures, such as invitations\n\nto webinars and online courses. This approach allows them to reuse the same lure across different targets and regions.\n\nAdditionally, while they primarily used the locally spoken languages of their targets, they now use the English language\n\nmore frequently.\n\nThis shift is exemplified in two different emails that use the same exact lure: one sent to targets in Saudi Arabia and the\n\nother to Israel. The main differences were the email addresses used to send them, and the final payload. In Saudi Arabia it\n\nwas an RMM, and in Israel, the custom backdoor BugSleep.\n\nComparison of two emails about online courses using the same lure:\n\n### Characteristics of email Version 1 Versio\n\n A compromised email account of a A compromised email From Saudi Arabian company. Israeli company.\n\n To Companies in Saudi Arabia. Companies in Israel.\n\n|Characteristics of email|Version 1|\n|---|---|\n|From|A compromised email account of a Saudi Arabian company.|\n|To|Companies in Saudi Arabia.|\n\n\n### Email includes a direct link to an Link Egnyte subdomain.\n\n\n### Email contains a PDF an embedded link.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Payload Atera RMM tool. BugSleep backdoor.\n\nFigure 3 – Email comparison (version 1 on the top).\n\nThe only differences in the content between the two emails are the company name and the last two lines with the link that\n\ncan be found in the PDF attachment.\n\nFigure 4 PDF attachment of email version 2\n\n|Payload|Atera RMM tool.|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nemploy, which have been consistently observed in their operations over the past few years.\n\n# BugSleep Infection Chain\n\nThe typical infection chain that delivers the BugSleep backdoor is as follows:\n\nFigure 5 – MuddyWater new infection chain.\n\n**Egnyte Abuse**\n\nEgnyte is a secure file-sharing platform that allows employees and companies to easily share files via a web browser.\n\nRecently, MuddyWater has frequently used Egnyte subdomains, aligning them with the company names used in their\n\nphishing emails. Upon opening the shared link, recipients can see the name of the purported sender, which often appears\n\nlegitimate, and matches the naming conventions of the targeted country.\n\nIn a link sent to a transportation company in Saudi Arabia, the displayed name of the owner was Khaled Mashal, the\n\nformer head of Hamas and one of its prominent leaders.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – Archive file shared by ‘Khaled Mashal’.\n\n# BugSleep Technical Analysis\n\nBugSleep is a new tailor-made malware used in MuddyWater phishing lures since May 2024, partially replacing their use\n\nof legitimate RMM tools. We discovered several versions of the malware being distributed, with differences between\n\neach version showing improvements and bug fixes (and sometimes creating new bugs). These updates, occurring within\n\nshort intervals between samples, suggest a trial-and-error approach.\n\nBugSleep main logic is similar in all versions, starting with many calls to the `Sleep API to evade sandboxes and then`\n\nit loads the APIs it needs to run properly. It then creates a mutex (we\n\nobserved `“PackageManager” and` `“DocumentUpdater” in our samples) and decrypts its configuration which`\n\nincludes the C&C IP address and port. All the configurations and strings are encrypted in the same way, where every byte\n\nis subtracted with the same hardcoded value.\n\nIn most BugSleep samples, the malware then creates a scheduled task with the same name as the mutex and adds the\n\ncomment `\"sample comment” to it. The scheduled task, which ensures persistence for BugSleep, runs the malware`\n\nand is triggered every 30 minutes on a daily basis.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Scheduled task method of setting up persistence used by BugSleep.\n\nThe malware communication is also encrypted the same way as its strings, adding 3 to every byte modulo 256. Every\n\nmessage exchanged between BugSleep and its C&C domain follows this format: `[size_of_data][data] .`\n\nBugSleep starts by sending the ID of the victim, consisting of the computer name followed by the username, formatted\n\nas `[computer_name][username] .`\n\nThe malware has several commands it can perform based on the data sent from the C&C:\n\n### # Of Command Arguments Descrip\n\n 1 File name Send a file content to\n\n 2 File name Write content into a fi\n\n Run commands throu 3 Command the command ‘termin\n\n Update ‘receive timeo 4 Timeout value new timeout value.\n\n 6 – Stop communication.\n\n 9 – Delete the persistence\n\n|# Of Command|Arguments|\n|---|---|\n|1|File name|\n|2|File name|\n|3|Command|\n|4|Timeout value|\n|6|–|\n\n\n-----\n\n### 10 – Get the status of the p\n\n 11 – Create the persistence\n\n Update sleep time (nofi 97 Sleep time version).\n\n Update the receive tim 98 Timeout value in the first version).\n\n Sends the same value 99 – ping).\n\n**Evasions**\n\nIn one of the malware versions, the developers implemented a couple of evasion methods from EDR solutions. First, the\n\nmalware enables the `MicrosoftSignedOnly flag of the` `ProcessSignaturePolicy structure to prevent the`\n\nprocess from loading images that are not signed by Microsoft. This prevents other processes from injecting DLLs into\n\n[the process.](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/defense-evasion/preventing-3rd-party-dlls-from-injecting-into-your-processes)\n\nNext, it enables the `ProhibitDynamicCode flag of the` `ProcessDynamicCodePolicy structure to prevent`\n\nthe process from generating dynamic code or modifying existing executable code.\n\nEnabling `ProcessDynamicCodePolicy may be useful for protecting it from EDR solutions that hook userland`\n\n[API functions to inspect programs’ intents.](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/defense-evasion/acg-arbitrary-code-guard-processdynamiccodepolicy)\n\nFigure 8 – Evasions method.\n\n**BugSleep Loader**\n\nOne of the samples we analyzed came with a custom loader. The loader injects a shellcode that loads BugSleep in\nmemory into one of the following processes, based on whether they are already running:\n\nmsedge.exe\n\nopera.exe\n\nchrome.exe\n\nanydesk exe\n\n|# Of Command|Arguments|\n|---|---|\n|10|–|\n|11|–|\n|97|Sleep time|\n|98|Timeout value|\n|99|–|\n\n\n-----\n\npowershell.exe\n\nThe shellcode in this case is also encrypted with the same algorithm as the strings in BugSleep but with a different shift:\n\nevery byte is subtracted with a hardcoded value of 6. After the decryption, the loader writes the shellcode inside the\n\nprocess with the `WriteProcessMemory API and invokes the shellcode with the` `CreateRemoteThread API.`\n\n**Bugs and Unused Code**\n\nSome of the samples contained several bugs, and parts of the code appear poorly written, with questionable omissions or\n\nadditions that seem to be mistakes.\n\nOne of the samples checks if the file `“C:\\users\\public\\a.txt” exists and if it doesn’t, it creates the file`\n\nwhich it later deletes. The purpose of this code is not entirely clear and may be unfinished code inserted by the\n\nauthors or borrowed from other places without fully understanding what the code does.\n\nIn one sample, some of the API names were not encrypted like the others, probably due to lack of attention.\n\nIn some samples, instead of properly encrypting (adding 3 to each byte), the malware runs the decryption\n\nalgorithm (subtracting each byte by 3), which is probably by mistake. In a newer sample, the malware authors\n\nfixed that bug but did not do the same for all of the commands. Another questionable action is that the malware\n\ndecrypts the data after it’s sent. We assume that their intent was to encrypt the strings again so they would not be\n\nseen in memory, but in this case, it does the opposite.\n\nFigure 9 – Encryption/Decryption confusion in the send method.\n\n# Targets\n\n\n-----\n\nentities and municipalities to media outlets and travel agencies. While the majority of the emails was directed at\n\ncompanies in Israel, others were aimed at entities in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, India and Portugal.\n\nFigure 10 – Map of targeted countries.\n\nIn addition, files associated with the latest campaign were uploaded to VirusTotal from various IP locations, including\n\nAzerbaijan and Jordan. Notably, in the case of Azerbaijan, we can establish correlation with the target due to the\n\nAzerbaijani language used in the PDF lure.\n\nFigure 11 – PDF lure written in Azerbaijani.\n\n**Translated PDF document:**\n\n\n-----\n\nInternational company CASPEL organizes an online webinar on information technologies and\n\nnetwork solutions.\n\nThe purpose of this international webinar is to prevent any cyber vandalism and build deep\n\nrelationship with information technology companies in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nMany reputable companies of the region will participate in this seminar, and any experts in\n\nthis field will discuss and exchange ideas.\n\nTo participate in the webinar, visit the link below and download the webinar software.\n\n[Link]\n\nThank you.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe increased activity of MuddyWater in the Middle East, particularly in Israel, highlights the persistent nature of these\n\nthreat actors, who continue to operate against a wide variety of targets in the region. Their consistent use of phishing\n\ncampaigns, now incorporating a custom backdoor, BugSleep, marks a notable development in their techniques, tactics\n\nand procedures (TTPs).\n\nThe campaigns reflect the group’s interests, focusing on specific sectors such as municipalities, airlines, travel agencies,\n\nand media outlets. Although they are aimed at specific sectors, the nature of the lures themselves have become much\n\nsimpler over time. The shift from highly customized lures to more generic themes such as webinars and online courses,\n\ncombined with the increased use of the English language, allows the group to focus on higher volume rather than specific\n\ntargets.\n\n**Check Point Customers Remain Protected Against the Threats Described in this Report.**\n\n**[Harmony Email and Collaboration provides comprehensive inline protection at the highest security level.](https://www.checkpoint.com/harmony/email-security/)**\n\n**Threat Emulation signatures:**\n\nAPT.Wins.MuddyWater.ta.X\n\nAPT.Wins.MuddyWater.ta.Y\n\nAPT.Win.MuddyWater.X\n\n**Harmony Endpoint signatures:**\n\nAPT.Win.MuddyWater.U\n\nAPT.Win.MuddyWater.V\n\n\n-----\n\n# IOCs\n\n**Domains:**\n```\nkinneretacil.egnyte[.]com\nsalary.egnyte[.]com\ngcare.egnyte[.]com\nrimonnet.egnyte[.]com\nalltrans.egnyte[.]com\nmegolan.egnyte[.]com\nbgu.egnyte[.]com\nfbcsoft.egnyte[.]com\ncnsmportal.egnyte[.]com\nalkan.egnyte[.]com\ngetter.egnyte[.]com\nksa1.egnyte[.]com\nfilecloud.egnyte[.]com\nnour.egnyte[.]com\nairpazfly.egnyte[.]com\ncairoairport.egnyte[.]com\nsilbermintz1.egnyte[.]com\nsmartcloudcompany[.]com\nonlinemailerservices[.]com\nsmtpcloudapp[.]com\nsoftwarehosts[.]com\nairpaz.egnyte[.]com\nairpazflys.egnyte[.]com\nfileuploadcloud.egnyte[.]com\ndownloadfile.egnyte[.]com\n\n```\n**URLs:**\n```\nhttps://shorturl[.]at/NCxJk\nhttps://shorturl[.]at/bYqUx\nhttps://ws.onehub[.]com/files/bbmiio1c\nhttps://ws.onehub[.]com/files/zgov9aqy\n\n```\n**IP addresses:**\n\n**C&C:**\n```\n146.19.143[.]14\n91.235.234[.]202\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n95.164.32[.]69\n5.252.23[.]52\n194.4.50[.]133\n193.109.120[.]59\n\n```\n**IP address used for sending emails:**\n```\n89.221.225[.]81\n45.150.108[.]198\n200.200.200[.]248\n169.150.227[.]230\n169.150.227[.]205\n185.248.85[.]20\n141.98.252[.]143\n31.171.154[.]54\n146.70.172[.]227\n198.54.131[.]36\n\n```\n**Hashes:**\n\n**BugSleep:**\n```\n73c677dd3b264e7eb80e26e78ac9df1dba30915b5ce3b1bc1c83db52b9c6b30e\n960d4c9e79e751be6cad470e4f8e1d3a2b11f76f47597df8619ae41c96ba5809\nb8703744744555ad841f922995cef5dbca11da22565195d05529f5f9095fbfca\n94278fa01900fdbfb58d2e373895c045c69c01915edc5349cd6f3e5b7130c472\n5df724c220aed7b4878a2a557502a5cefee736406e25ca48ca11a70608f3a1c0\n\n```\n**RMM MSI:**\n```\n39da7cc7c627ea4c46f75bcec79e5669236e6b43657dcad099e1b9214527670e\nc23f17b92b13464a570f737a86c0960d5106868aaa5eac2f2bac573c3314eb0f\nfb58c54a6d0ed24e85b213f0c487f8df05e421d7b07bd2bece3a925a855be93a\n7e6b04e17ae273700cef4dc08349af949dbd4d3418159d607529ae31285e18f7\nff2ae62ba88e7068fa142bbe67d7b9398e8ae737a43cf36ace1fcf809776c909\ne2810cca5d4b74e0fe04591743e67da483a053a8b06f3ef4a41bdabee9c48cf7\n90f94d98386c179a1b98a1f082b0c7487b22403d8d5eb3db6828725d14392ded\n20aaeac4dbea89b50d011e9becdf51afc1a1a1f254a5f494b80c108fd3c7f61a\n55af6a90ac8863f27b3fcaa416a0f1e4ff02fb42aa46a7274c6b76aa000aacc2\nf925d929602c9bae0a879bb54b08f5f387d908d4766506c880c5d29986320cf9\n\n```\n**Archives:**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nc80c8dd7be3ccf18e327355b880afb5a24d5a0596939458fb13319e05c4d43e9\nc88453178f5f6aaab0cab2e126b0db27b25a5cfe6905914cc430f6f100b7675c\n31591fcf677a2da2834d2cc99a00ab500918b53900318f6b19ea708eba2b38ab\na0968e820bbc5e099efd55143028b1997fd728d923c19af03a1ccec34ce73d9b\n88788208316a6cf4025dbabbef703f51d77d475dc735bf826b8d4a13bbd6a3ee\n4064e4bb9a4254948047858301f2b75e276a878321b0cc02710e1738b42548ca\ne7896ccb82ae35e1ee5949b187839faab0b51221d510b25882bbe711e57c16d2\n1c0947258ddb608c879333c941f0738a7f279bc14630f2c8877b82b8046acf91\n8fbd374d4659efdc5b5a57ff4168236aeaab6dae4af6b92d99ac28e05f04e5c1\n7e14ca8cb7980e85aff4038f489442eace33530fd02e2b9c382a4b6907601bee\n02060a9ea0d0709e478e2fba6e9b71c1b7315356acc4f64e40802185c4f42f1c\n53b4a4359757e7f4e83929fba459677e76340cbec7e2e1588bbf70a4df7b0e97\n0ab2b0a2c46d14593fe900e7c9ce5370c9cfbf6927c8adb5812c797a25b7f955\n\n```\n\n-----",
