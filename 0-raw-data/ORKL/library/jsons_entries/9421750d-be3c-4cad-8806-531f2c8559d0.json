    "plain_text": "# Second New 'IsaacWiper' Data Wiper Targets Ukraine After Russian Invasion\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/03/second-new-isaacwiper-data-wiper.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/second-new-isaacwiper-data-wiper.html)**\n\nMarch 1, 2022\n\nA new data wiper malware has been observed deployed against an unnamed Ukrainian\ngovernment network, a day after destructive cyber attacks struck multiple entities in the country\npreceding the start of Russia's military invasion.\n\n[Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET dubbed the new malware \"IsaacWiper,\" which it said was detected](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\non February 24 in an organization that was not affected by [HermeticWiper (aka FoxBlade), another](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-wiper-malware-targeting-ukraine.html)\ndata wiping malware that targeted several organizations on February 23 as part of a sabotage\noperation aimed at rendering the machines unusable.\n\nFurther analysis of the HermeticWiper attacks, which infected at least five Ukrainian organizations,\nhave revealed a worm constituent that propagates the malware across the compromised network\nand a ransomware module that acts as a \"distraction from the wiper attacks,\" corroborating a prior\nreport from Symantec.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"These destructive attacks leveraged at least three components: HermeticWiper for wiping the data,\nHermeticWizard for spreading on the local network, and HermeticRansom acting as a decoy\nransomware,\" the company said.\n\nIn a separate analysis of the new Golang-based ransomware, Russian cybersecurity company\n[Kaspersky, which codenamed the malware \"Elections GoRansom,\" characterized it as a last-minute](https://securelist.com/elections-goransom-and-hermeticwiper-attack/105960/)\noperation, adding it was \"likely used as a smokescreen for the HermeticWiper attack due to its nonsophisticated style and poor implementation.\"\n\nAs an anti-forensic measure, HermeticWiper is also designed to hinder analysis by erasing itself\nfrom the disk by overwriting its own file with random bytes.\n\nESET said it hasn't been able to find \"any tangible connection\" to attribute these attacks to a known\nthreat actor. But the malware artifacts unearthed so far make it clear that the intrusions had been\nplanned for several months, with the targeted entities suffering compromises well in advance of the\nwiper's deployment.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is based on several facts: the HermeticWiper PE compilation timestamps, the oldest being\nDecember 28, 2021; the code-signing certificate issue date of April 13, 2021; and the deployment of\nHermeticWiper through the default domain policy in at least one instance, suggesting the attackers\nhad prior access to one of that victim's Active Directory servers,\" said Jean-Ian Boutin, ESET head\nof threat research.\n\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nAlso unknown are the initial access vectors used to deploy both the wipers, although it's suspected\n[that the attackers leveraged tools like Impacket and RemCom, a remote access software, for lateral](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)\nmovement and malware distribution.\n\nFurthermore, IsaacWiper shares no code-level overlaps with HermeticWiper and is substantially\nless sophisticated, even as it sets out to enumerate all the physical and logical drives before\nproceeding to carry out its file wiping operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn February 25, 2022, attackers dropped a new version of IsaacWiper with debug logs, the\nresearchers said. \"This may indicate that the attackers were unable to wipe some of the targeted\nmachines and added log messages to understand what was happening.\"\n\n**_[Update: Microsoft, which is tracking HermeticWiper under the name FoxBlade (and](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/microsoft-finds-foxblade-malware-hit.html)_**\nHermeticRansom as SonicVote), said the \"intended objective of these attacks is the disruption,\ndegradation, and destruction of targeted resources\" in Ukraine.\n\nThe infections impacted \"hundreds of systems spanning multiple government, information\ntechnology, financial sector, and energy organizations predominantly located in or with a nexus to\nUkraine,\" it [noted.](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/02/28/analysis-resources-cyber-threat-activity-ukraine/#updated-malware-details)\n\nThe tech giant's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has attributed the attacks to an emerging threat\ncluster designated as DEV-0665, pointing out its lack of affiliation to a previously known threat\n[activity group. It's worth noting here that the actor responsible for the WhisperGate wiper attacks in](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/a-new-destructive-malware-targeting.html)\nJanuary is known as DEV-0586.\n\nAssigning IsaacWiper-related intrusions the moniker Lasainraw, Microsoft also characterized them\nas a \"limited destructive malware attack,\" adding it's \"continuing to investigate this incident and has\nnot currently linked it to known threat activity.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
