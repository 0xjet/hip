However,](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Russian+language+malspam+pushing+Shade+Troldesh+ransomware/24358/)\nsometime in February 2019, this malicious spam (malspam) has altered its tactics slightly.\nInstead of a zip archive directly attached to the malspam, recent emails have attached PDF\nfiles with links to download the zip archive. Otherwise, this infection activity remains\nrelatively unchanged.\n\n**_Details_**\n\nMalspam pushing Shade has a variety of subjects, spoofed sending addresses, and\nmessage text. The common theme is some sort of order or invoice. The attached PDF files\nhave links to download an alleged invoice, which was saved as pic.zip when I checked.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: From malspam to PDF to downloaded zip archive._\n\n**_Pic.zip contained a JavaScript (.js) file designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host when_**\ndouble-clicked. Infection traffic remained similar to previous examples of Shade\nransomware, and my infected Windows host exhibited the expected behavior.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Downloaded zip archive and extracted .js file._\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Desktop of an infected Windows host._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Decryption instructions from the Tor page._\n\nIndicators of compromise (IoCs)\n\nThe following are indicators associated with today's infection:\n\nSHA256 hash:\n[6950efbd9d6d10fdd8f644a71b30e53a8d1dbd64976279d8a192a0c9459d06e1](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6950efbd9d6d10fdd8f644a71b30e53a8d1dbd64976279d8a192a0c9459d06e1/)\n\nFile name: pic.zakaz.pdf\nFile size: 18,831 bytes\nFile description: PDF attachment from malspam pushing Shade/Troldesh ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n[SHA256 hash: e76b93f6ab032e16f5f1d600cb061db49a10538b10a063561df95be94156ac0b](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/e76b93f6ab032e16f5f1d600cb061db49a10538b10a063561df95be94156ac0b/)\n\nFile name: pic.zip\nFile size: 3,493 bytes\nFile location: hxxp://simplerlife[.]pl/wp-content/themes/hueman/assets/admin/css/pic.zip\nFile description: Downloaded zip archive from link in PDF attachment\n\n[SHA256 hash: 17539e1a0c33fe2f98fa1b8fa282f9f3786ba15419e30ae6c4171ccff65338c9](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/17539e1a0c33fe2f98fa1b8fa282f9f3786ba15419e30ae6c4171ccff65338c9/)\n\nFile size: 6,932 bytes\nFile description: .js file extracted from pic.zip\n\n[SHA256 hash: 33dde2eed8ccb2b74c9d0feaf19c341354e54cb5d2c9e475507ff3fe22240381](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/33dde2eed8ccb2b74c9d0feaf19c341354e54cb5d2c9e475507ff3fe22240381/)\n\nFile size: 1,254,664 bytes\nFile location: hxxp://sidneyyin[.]com/templates/joomlage0084-aravnik/css/msg.jpg\nFile location: C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\rad8EEC7.tmp\nFile location: C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\csrss.exe\nFile description: Downloaded zip archive from link in PDF attachment\n\nTraffic from an infected Windows host:\n\n62.212.69[.]227 port 80 - simplerlife[.]pl - GET /wpcontent/themes/hueman/assets/admin/css/pic.zip\n74.220.207[.]61 port 80 - sidneyyin[.]com - GET /templates/joomlage0084aravnik/css/msg.jpg\nVarious IP addresses over various TCP ports - Tor traffic\nport 80 - whatismyipaddress.com - GET /\nport 80 - whatsmyip.net - GET /\n\nEmail address and URLs from the decryption instructions:\n\npilotpilot088@gmail.com\nhxxp://cryptsen7fo43rr6[.]onion/\nhxxp://cryptsen7fo43rr6[.]onion.to/\nhxxp://cryptsen7fo43rr6[.]onion.cab/\n\n**_Final words_**\n\n[As I stated last time, Russian language malspam pushing Shade/Troldesh ransomware is](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Russian+language+malspam+pushing+Shade+Troldesh+ransomware/24358/)\nnothing new. Since [I first posted a diary about it back in 2016, it's never disappeared for](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Malspam+distributing+Troldesh+ransomware/21717/)\n[long. Nor is this malspam limited to Russian language. An example I documented in 2017](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/03/03/index.html)\nwas from English malspam.
