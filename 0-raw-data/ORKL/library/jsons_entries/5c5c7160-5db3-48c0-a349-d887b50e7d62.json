We are still processing and analyzing the attack data recorded.\n\nDuring the past month, Qurium has received brief but frequent denial attacks against the\n[Philippine alternative media outlets Bulatlat and](https://www.bulatlat.com/) [Altermidya, as well as the human rights](https://www.altermidya.net/)\ngroup [Karapatan.](https://www.karapatan.org/)\n\nThis forensic report summarizes our findings and has been updated since the release of the\nfirst version to include the new findings.\n\n### Summary of attacks\n\nThis section includes a brief summary of some of the attacks recorded during May – June\n2021.\n\n2021/05/17 02:24 HTTP POST flood against Bulatlat\n2021/05/17 02:40 HTTP GET flood against Karapatan\n\nThese two attacks had specific signatures including the “SSL negotiation fingerprint”, the\n[type of payload and that the service “check-host” was used by the attacker to verify if the](https://www.check-host.net/)\nattacks were successful.\n\n2021/05/18 06:06 Using a server from virmach.com 23.95.9{.}155, the attacker floods\nAltermidya with requests using Apache Benchmark tool (ApacheBench/2.3)\n\n\n-----\n\n2021/05/18 07:33 A machine from the Department of Science and Technology (PH)\nwith IP address 202.90.137{.}42 launches a vulnerability scan against Bulatlat. The\n[sequence of the scan reassembles the use of the tool “Sn1per” from](https://github.com/1N3/Sn1per) [Xerosecurity.](https://xerosecurity.com/wordpress/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSample of the logs of the Pentest\n\nThe IP seems to belong to the The Philippine Research, Education, and Government\nInformation Network.\n\n\n-----\n\nSophos\n\nCertificate C4307BK7HWCPJEB signed by hardware supplier “IP Solutions Inc”\nA close look into the IP reveals that a Sophos firewall is behind the IP address. The\nappliance has a Certificate in the name of IP-Solutions Inc. The [company (Lorna V. Zacate)](http://www.ip-solutionsinc.net/)\nsigning the digital certificates of the appliances is a supplier of hardware and services to the\nGovernmental Institutions in the Philippines.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile searching for Sophos Firewall machines in the same network, we found another unit in\nthe next IP 202.90.137{.}43, also with digital certificate in the name of IP Solutions Inc. This\nbox also has a service in port 3400 with the details:\n```\nacepcionecjr{@}army.mil.ph Taguig Red Server\n\n```\nThe RED Server seems to refer to Sophos XG Technology RED, Remote Ethernet Device\n(RED) is a small network appliance that allows to build tunnels and internal networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nProtocol RED. Port 3400 and TLS\nWe also found that the Marine Corps of the Philippines have their Scrollout F1 anti-spam\nmailserver inside of DOST, confirming the idea that military operates inside the IP space\nassigned to the Department of Science of Technology.\n\n\n-----\n\nPresence of other military infrastructure in the subnet\nThe certificate of the “RED” Sophos server provided the following information:\n```\nIP: 202.90.137.43\nemailAddress = acepcionecjr{@}army.mil.ph \nCountry = PH \nLocation = Taguig \nOrganization = ARMY\n\n```\nUsing RiskIQ we searched for the history of certificates of 202.90.137{.}43 and\n202.90.137{.}42 and we found that the certificate of the attacker IP “.42” has been seen in\nanother providers.\n```\nAS17639 ComClark Network & Technology Corp.|121.58.209.215|\nAS9821 Department of Science and Technology|202.90.137.42|\nAS6648 Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.|125.212.41.130|\nAS17639 ComClark Network & Technology Corp.|121.58.248.18|\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nBut the most interesting finding was when we did a search for certificates containing the\nemail: acepcionecjr{@}army.mil.ph in Censys.\n\nAnother certificate showed up! This one contained the (O)rganization name= OG2-PA\n\n## What is OG2-PA?\n\nIn the context of the military jargon, OG2 stands for Office of the Assistant Chief _of Staff for_\n_Intelligence and PA stands for Philippine Army._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Wikipedia Edits\n\nAnother interesting finding is that the attacker’s IP address is present in the Edits of the\nWikipedia page for “Chief of Army (Philippines)” and many other pages related to the Army.\n\nWe could also reconfirm that other IP addresses using the same digital certificate had also\nmake similar edits.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Linking .42 and .43 addresses\n\nDuring our research we could confirm that (1) both address run similar hardware, Sophos XG\nand RED tunneling, (2) both boxes have digital certificates of the hardware supplier “IP\nSolutions Inc” and (3) that their very first certificates were issued 2015-07-31 (Source:\nRiskIQ)\n\n## Attacks continue\n\n\n-----\n\n2021/05/20 13:05 Karapatan receives a small flood with user-agent AdobeUxTechC4Async/3.0.12 (win32). The machine 188.63.78{.}119 crawls heavily media from the\nPhilippines.\n2021/06/16 06:42 Large flood on Altermidya and Bulatlat from multiple IP addresses.\nFloods include requests of the type /?\nu144642756919q213158629662aB2146578135208224622277442H and user agent:\nnull\n\n2021/06/22 22:50 – 2021/06/23 – 03:00 Attacks against Bulatlat and Altermidya for\nseveral hours. During the DDOS attacks a pen testing against the sites was conducted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker launched a “Denial of Service” against bulatlat.com, flooding the site with\nrequests of the type GET /?q=123456789. At the very same time the attacker run “Nikto” to\npen test the site. The flood run 1000+ faster that the pen testing script. We have sample\ndown 1/1000 the “Denial of Service” logs to visualize the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nPen testing attack “Nikto” while running DDOS.\n\n## Abuse Handling and official reaction\n\nDays before the release of this report, we reached out to ops@pregi.net and\ndenis@asti.dost.gov.ph to request more information about the IP addresses inside DOSTASTI. Qurium also mailed to “IP Solutions Inc.” as suppliers of the Sophos XG Firewalls for\nextra information.\n\nThe mailbox of Denis F. Villorente, point of contact for Abuse cases (Abuse ASTIPH)\nbounced as mailbox was full. IP Solutions did not respond to our request for information.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbuse contact details for the network\n\n[29 June 2021] The public official response that we have read in the media:\n\nRowena Cristina Guevara (DOST-ASTI) told the [PNA that addresses were received](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1144854)\nfrom the Regional Registry (APNIC) and DOST provides IP space to other\nGovernmental Agencies.\nThat Qurium traced the attack to the IP address does not mean the DOST involvement.\nDOST-ASTI has not made public which Governmental Agency is behind the IP\naddress.\n[The army spokesman Col. Ramon Zagala stated that the Philippine Army “respects](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1450227/cyberattacks-on-red-tagged-news-sites-traced-to-dost-army)\nfreedom of expression and per policy, will never infringe that freedom”.\n[In a Zoom interview for ABS-CBN, DOST confirmed that the IP space belongs to an](https://twitter.com/ANCALERTS/status/1410460315398152192)\n“Agency” which name can not be revealed not to burden DICT investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur open questions still remain:\n\n1. Which Organization or Institution operates behind the address 202.90.137{.}42?\n2. Why such organization and their Abuse Handling details are not properly reflected in\n\nthe APNIC Whois Database or any other public resource to speed up “Network Abuse”\nresolution?\n3. Who is acepcionecjr @ army.mil.ph?\n\n## Media coverage\n\n[2 Jul 2021] The Register Digital rights org claims cyberattacks against Filipino media\noutlets come from government and army\n\n[[30 Jun 2021] ABS-CBN DOST, Army asked to clarify alleged links to cyberattacks](https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/06/30/21/cyberattacks-ddos-dost-ph-army)\n\n[29 Jun 2021] Inquirer.net [Probe cyberattacks](https://opinion.inquirer.net/141587/probe-cyberattacks)\n\n[24 Jun 2021] CNN Palace: ‘Unfair’ to link govt. agencies to cyberattacks on alternative\nnews sites pending probe\n\n[[23 Jun 2021] Rappler Military, DOST links found in DDoS attacks on media – report](https://www.rappler.com/technology/qurium-links-dost-military-found-ddos-attacks-altermidya-bulatlat)\n\n\n-----",
