The use of\ncompromised infrastructure has far-reaching consequences for organizations who may unwittingly be\nparticipating in hostile activity against Russian government, military and civilian targets.\nDocker Engine honeypots were compromised to execute two different Docker images targeting Russian,\nBelarusian and Lithuanian websites in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\nBoth Docker images’ target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the Ukraine governmentbacked Ukraine IT Army (UIA).\nThe two images have been downloaded over 150,000 times, but CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot assess\nhow many of these downloads originate from compromised infrastructure.\nCrowdStrike customers are protected from this threat with the CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Workload\nProtection module.\n\nBetween February 27 and March 1, 2022, Docker Engine honeypots were observed to have been\ncompromised in order to execute two different Docker images targeting Russian and Belarusian websites in a\n[denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Both Docker images’ target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/denial-of-service-dos-attacks/)\nUkraine government-backed Ukraine IT Army (UIA). The UIA previously called its members to perform\n[distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Russian targets. There may be risk of retaliatory activity by](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attacks/)\nthreat actors supporting the Russian Federation, against organizations being leveraged to unwittingly conduct\ndisruptive attacks against government, military and civilian websites.\n\n## Initial Compromise via Exposed Docker Engine\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [honeypot was compromised via an exposed Docker Engine API, a technique that is commonly used by](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/honeypots-in-cybersecurity-explained/)\n[opportunistic campaigns such as LemonDuck or](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/lemonduck-botnet-targets-docker-for-cryptomining-operations/) [WatchDog to infect misconfigured container engines.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/new-docker-cryptojacking-attempts-detected-over-2021-holidays/)\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe first Docker image that was observed — called `abagayev/stop-russia — is hosted on Docker Hub. This`\nimage has been downloaded over 100,000 times, but CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot assess how many of\nthese downloads originate from compromised infrastructure. The Docker image contains a Go-based HTTP\nbenchmarking tool named `bombardier with SHA256 hash`\n\n```\n6d38fda9cf27fddd45111d80c237b86f87cf9d350c795363ee016bb030bb3453\n\n```\n\nthat uses HTTP-based requests to stress-test a website. In this case, this tool was abused as a DoS tool that\nstarts automatically when a new container based on the Docker image is created. Upon starting, the targetselection routine picks a random entry from a hard-coded target list. Later versions of this Docker image\nalternatively pick one of the first 24 entries of the target list, based on the current hour.\n\nFigure 1. Excerpt of targeted websites\n\nThe deployed image was updated once on March 1, 2022. The most significant difference between the two\nversions of this image is that the target list was expanded. The target list contains Russian websites from the\nfollowing sectors: government, military, media, finance, energy, retail, mining, manufacturing, chemicals,\nproduction, technology, advertisements, agriculture, transportation and political parties. Also on March 1, 2022,\nBelarusian websites from the media, retail, government and military sectors were added to the target list.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses the activity deploying this Docker image as very likely automated based on\nclosely overlapping timelines in the interaction with the Docker API. This assessment is made with moderate\nconfidence, based on three separate incidents showing analogous timelines.\n\nThe second Docker image is named `erikmnkl/stoppropaganda . This image has been downloaded over`\n50,000 times from Docker Hub. Again, the portion of these downloads that originated from compromised\nmachines is unknown. The image contains a custom Go-based DoS program named `stoppropaganda that`\nhas the following SHA256 hash\n\n```\n3f954dd92c4d0bc682bd8f478eb04331f67cd750e8675fc8c417f962cc0fb31f\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nthat sends HTTP GET requests to a list of target websites that overloads them with requests. The attack\nfocused on Russian and Belarusian websites in the same sectors: government, military, energy, mining, retail,\nmedia and finance. Furthermore, three Lithuanian media websites fell victim to the attack.\n\nFigure 2. Excerpt of targeted websites\n\n## CrowdStrike Detection\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon® platform protects its customers with its runtime protection and cloud machine\nlearning models from any post-exploitation activities. As can be seen in Figure 3, the malicious DoS process\nfrom the `erikmnkl/stoppropaganda image gets terminated by Falcon’s cloud-based machine learning`\nmodel, when running the Docker container on a host with the Falcon Sensor for Linux installed.\n\nFigure 3. CrowdStrike’s cloud-based machine learning model kills the malicious process (Click to enlarge)\n\n## Assessment\n\nBoth Docker images’ target lists overlap with domains reportedly shared by the Ukraine government-backed\nUIA that called its members to perform DDoS attacks against Russian targets. CrowdStrike Intelligence\nassesses these actors almost certainly compromised the honeypots to support pro-Ukrainian DDoS attacks.\nThis assessment is made with high confidence based on the targeted websites.\n\n### CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Descriptions\n\nHigh Confidence – Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in\nthe quality and quantity of source information supporting a judgment does not imply that that assessment is an\nabsolute certainty or fact. The judgment still has a marginal probability of being inaccurate.\n\n\n-----\n\nModerate Confidence Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and plausible, but not of\nsufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. This level of confidence is\nused to express that judgments carry an increased probability of being incorrect until more information is\navailable or corroborated.\n\nLow Confidence – Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain, the information is too\nfragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic inferences, or the reliability of the source is\nuntested. Further information is needed for corroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nImage Name Image Digest\n```\n abagayev/stop-russia af39263fe21815e776842c220e010433f48647f850288b5fe749db3d7783bcb0\n abagayev/stop-russia f190731012d3766c05ef8153309602dea29c93be596dcde506e3047e9ded5eae\n erikmnkl/stoppropaganda aacbb56f72616bbb82720cb897b6a07168a3a021dd524782ee759bbec3439fda\n\n```\nFilename SHA256 Hash\n```\n bombardier 6d38fda9cf27fddd45111d80c237b86f87cf9d350c795363ee016bb030bb3453\n stoppropaganda 3f954dd92c4d0bc682bd8f478eb04331f67cd750e8675fc8c417f962cc0fb31f\n\n### Snort\n\n```\nThe following Snort rule can be used to detect HTTP requests sent by `erikmnkl/stoppropaganda :`\n```\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg: \"Detects DoS HTTP request sent by\nerikmnkl/stoppropaganda tool\"; flow:to_server, established; content:\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0|3B|\nWin64|3B| x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36\";\nhttp_header; content:\"GET\"; http_method; classtype:trojan-activity; metadata:service http;\nsid:8001951; rev:20220420;)\n\n```\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Learn how you can stop cloud breaches with CrowdStrike unified cloud security posture management](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cloud-security-products/)_\n_and breach prevention for multi-cloud and hybrid environments — all in one lightweight platform._\n_[Learn more about how Falcon Cloud Workload Protection enables organizations to build, run and secure](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cloud-security-products/falcon-cloud-workload-protection/)_\n_cloud-native applications with speed and confidence._\n_See if a managed solution is right for you.
