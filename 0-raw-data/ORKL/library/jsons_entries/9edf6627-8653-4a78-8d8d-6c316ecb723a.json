    "plain_text": "# FBI Warning: HelloKitty Ransomware Add DDoS to Extortion Arsenal\n\n**[speartip.com/resources/fbi-hellokitty-ransomware-adds-ddos-to-extortion-arsenal/](https://www.speartip.com/resources/fbi-hellokitty-ransomware-adds-ddos-to-extortion-arsenal/)**\n\nNovember 2, 2021\n\nChris Swagler | November 2nd, 2021\n\nThe United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning to private\ncompany partners that the HelloKitty ransomware group (aka FiveHands) has added\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to their extortion methods. Coordinating with the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FBI explained that the\nransomware group will shut down their victims’ websites in DDoS attacks if they refuse the\nransom demands. The HelloKitty ransomware group is known for extracting sensitive data\nfrom the victims’ compromised servers before encrypting them. By using the exfiltrated files\nas leverage, the threat actors pressure victims into paying the ransom by threatening to\nrelease the stolen data on their data leak website.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the FBI, the threat actors implement a DDoS attack on a company s public\nwebsite if they refuse to pay the ransom or do not respond quickly. HelloKitty (FiveHands)\nactors demand customized Bitcoin (BTC) ransom payments equivalent to each victim’s ability\nto pay. The threat actors either post the stolen data on their Babuk site “payload.bin” or sell it\nto a third-party data broker if the victim does not pay the ransom. The HelloKitty operators\nutilize several tactics and techniques to breach the targeted networks, including\ncompromised credentials and security flaws in recently patched SonicWall products,\nincluding CVE-2021-20016, CVE-2021-20021, CVE-2021-20022, and CVE-2021-2002.\n\nIn November 2020, HelloKitty began as a human-operated ransomware group and quickly\nattracted the FBI’s attention in January 2021. In February, the group was responsible for\nbreaching and encrypting the CD Projekt Red systems and stealing source codes from\nCyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3, Gwent, and other games. Although it was never confirmed,\nHelloKitty claimed that the stolen CD Projekt Red files were purchased by a third party. The\nransomware group has been using a Linux variant targeting VMware’s ESXi virtual machine\nplatform since July 2021. HelloKitty is one of many ransomware groups targeting Linux\nservers after companies switch to virtual machines for more efficient resource use and easier\ndevice management. Ransomware operators can simultaneously encrypt multiple servers\nwith a single command by targeting a company’s virtual machines, saving the group time and\neffort. HelloKitty was increasingly active in July and August since they started using the Linux\nvariant in their attacks, according to victim submissions on the ID Ransomware platform.\n\nTo assist cybersecurity professionals and system administrators in guarding their networks\nagainst coordinated HelloKitty ransomware attacks, the FBI added an extensive collection of\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) in their alert. With ransomware groups like HelloKitty adding\nmore complex extortion techniques, including DDoS, to their attack arsenal, it’s crucial that\ncompanies view paying threat actors the ransom as a “last resort”. Groups like HelloKitty will\ndeploy different extortion tactics, like DDoS, to squeeze payments out of victims.\n\nAt [SpearTip, our certified engineers have the experience in handling these situations and](https://www.speartip.com/)\nnegotiating with threat actors, so your company won’t have to.
