Over time, Cobalt Strike became the de facto commercial standard for red team\noperations and adversary simulations. I’ve long asked myself, how do I stay a good partner\nto my customers as their numbers grow and this field evolves?\n\n[Today is a big step forward as Minnesota-based HelpSystems, LLC has acquired Strategic](https://www.helpsystems.com/)\nCyber. I have joined HelpSystems as a Technical Director for Cybersecurity. I will lead the\n[team that continues the R&D-driven releases of the Cobalt Strike product. The Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\nproduct and business operations of Strategic Cyber will benefit from the experience and\nresources at HelpSystems.\n\nHelpSystems is a good fit for Strategic Cyber and its customers. The company was founded\nin 1982 and is a cyber security company and the largest independent vendor in the IBM i\nspace. Their portfolio includes antivirus, identity and access management, secure file\ntransfer, intrusion detection, and security services for IBM i, Linux, and other platforms.\nHelpSystems became successful through good products, partnership with their customers,\nand taking care of their team.\n\n[HelpSystems is the parent company of Core Security, the creators of the](https://www.coresecurity.com/) [Core Impact](https://www.coresecurity.com/core-impact)\npenetration testing tool. Core Impact came to market in 2003, a time when exploits were\npublished by anonymous authors and the use of these exploits had safety and reliability\nimplications. Core Impact became the trusted product to automate penetration tests, exploit\nthe latest vulnerabilities, and pivot to new targets.\n\nCobalt Strike’s story is similar. Cobalt Strike came to market in 2012, a time when security\nmeant [prevention of breaches with less thought on post-breach containment, detection, and](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/2014/10/30/give-me-any-zero-day-and-i-will-rule-the-world/)\n[response Cobalt Strike explored the post-breach offense problems of team collaboration](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/2014/06/12/cobalt-strike-innovative-offense-or-just-a-gui/)\n\n\n-----\n\nflexible communications, and novel capability to demonstrate risks. When security teams\nneeded to emulate real-world attack scenarios to improve security operations and exercise\nprocesses, Cobalt Strike became the natural choice.\n\nI’m excited to explore the synergy between Cobalt Strike and Core Impact. Our work is to\nshare knowledge, offer real insight into risk, and drive objective and meaningful security\nadvances. As this field evolves, we will evolve with it.\n\nPress Release:\nhttps://www.helpsystems.com/about/news/helpsystems-acquires-cobalt-strike-expand-coresecurity-business\n\n\n-----",
