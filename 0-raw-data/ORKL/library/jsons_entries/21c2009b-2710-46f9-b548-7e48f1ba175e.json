We make this assessment based on\nRedHotel’s persistence, high operational tempo, and global targeting scope. Using Recorded Future®\nNetwork Intelligence, we have identified the group targeting at least 17 countries within Asia, Europe,\nand North America from 2021 to 2023, across academia, aerospace, government, media,\ntelecommunications, and research and development (R&D) sectors. RedHotel primarily poses a threat to\ngovernment organizations worldwide, particularly within the Southeast Asia region, as well as private\nsector companies operating within the highlighted targeted sectors.\n\nWe identified RedHotel employing a multi-tiered infrastructure network for malware\ncommand-and-control (C2), reconnaissance, and exploitation, and observed likely administration of this\ninfrastructure from China-based IP addresses geolocating to Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. Earlier\n[industry findings](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/a/earth-lusca-employs-sophisticated-infrastructure-varied-tools-and-techniques/technical-brief-delving-deep-an-analysis-of-earth-lusca-operations.pdf) on RedHotel activity also further corroborate that the group likely operates out of\nChengdu. In addition, RedHotel’s targeting purview, tooling, and modus operandi closely resembles the\noperations of other private contractor groups affiliated with China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS),\nincluding other Chengdu-based threat activity groups such as RedGolf (aka APT41, Brass Typhoon).\nThe well-documented activity of multiple MSS-linked contractors located in Chengdu, several of which\nhave displayed close ties to local universities, provides evidence that the city is likely a hub of\n[MSS-linked cyber talent development and operations (1,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) [2). Organizations can defend against RedHotel](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nactivity by prioritizing hardening and vulnerability patching of internet-facing appliances (particularly\ncorporate VPN, mail server, and network devices), logging and monitoring of these devices, and\nimplementing network segmentation to limit exposure and lateral movement potential to internal\nnetworks.\n\nRedHotel activity overlaps with publicly reported activity under the aliases Aquatic Panda\n(CrowdStrike), BRONZE UNIVERSITY (SecureWorks), Charcoal Typhoon (Microsoft), Earth Lusca (Trend\nMicro), and Red Scylla (PWC), and, as noted above, was previously [tracked](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan) by Recorded Future under\nthe temporary group designator TAG-22.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - Based on targeting trends, RedHotel likely operates with a mission of both intelligence gathering\nand economic espionage. The group has frequently targeted government organizations for\ntraditional intelligence collection, but has also engaged in the targeting of COVID-19 research\nand technology R&D organizations.\n\n  - In July 2022, RedHotel likely compromised a US state legislature, with infrastructure linked to\nthis organization observed regularly communicating with RedHotel-attributed ShadowPad and\nCobalt Strike C2 IP addresses.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n  - RedHotel has operated 2 distinct infrastructure clusters, with one largely dedicated to\nreconnaissance and initial access operations and a second to maintaining long-term access into\ntargeted networks via command-and-control (C2) servers.\n\n  - The group has been active since at least 2019 and employs a mixture of offensive security tools\n(such as Cobalt Strike and Brute Ratel), closed-source but shared capabilities (such as\nShadowPad and Winnti), and bespoke tooling (such as Spyder and FunnySwitch) across\ncampaigns.\n\n## Background: RedHotel Emerges from the Winnti and ShadowPad Noise\n\nAs a ShadowPad and Winnti user — both of which are custom malware families privately shared across\na wide range of Chinese state-sponsored actors — RedHotel has occasionally blended in with the noise\nand created challenges in clustering and attribution. However, the group’s high operational tempo,\ndistinct infrastructure TTPs, and wider use of both custom and offensive security tooling has led us to\ngraduate the previously temporary group designator TAG-22 to RedHotel based on both our ongoing\ntechnical tracking of the group and our assessment that RedHotel very likely operates in support of\nChinese government intelligence-gathering efforts.\n\nIn September 2020, Recorded Future clients received a report on RedHotel (then referred to as TAG-22)\nactivity targeting a Hong Kong university and airport, which was followed up by July 2021 public\n[reporting](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan) detailing the group’s targeting of government, research and development, and\ntelecommunications organizations in Nepal, Taiwan, and The Philippines. This activity featured close\ninfrastructure, capability, and targeting overlaps with earlier ESET [reporting](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/) also highlighting the\n[targeting of universities in Hong Kong. Avast](https://decoded.avast.io/luigicamastra/backdoored-client-from-mongolian-ca-monpass/) [and NTT](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf) researchers also published reports on\noverlapping RedHotel activity around this time, which analyzed the group’s use of compromised Oracle\nGlassFish servers for exploitation and reconnaissance, as well as a software supply-chain compromise\ntargeting the Mongolian certification authority (CA) MonPass using the custom Fishmaster (Jolly\nJellyfish) downloader to load Cobalt Strike.\n\n[In late 2021, PWC researchers reported on RedHotel activity (then referred to as Red Dev 10),](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html)\nspecifically highlighting the group’s use of a bespoke packing mechanism used to obfuscate the group’s\nShadowPad payloads, called ScatterBee (aka ShadowShredder or PoppingBee). CrowdStrike also\n[reported on RedHotel’s (Aquatic Panda) exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability during this timeframe](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/overwatch-exposes-aquatic-panda-in-possession-of-log-4-shell-exploit-tools/)\n[and have assessed that the group likely operates as a contractor serving the MSS. In January 2022,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/aquatic-panda/)\n[Trend Micro highlighted RedHotel’s (referred to as Earth Lusca) full intrusion lifecycle, noting multiple](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/a/earth-lusca-employs-sophisticated-infrastructure-varied-tools-and-techniques/technical-brief-delving-deep-an-analysis-of-earth-lusca-operations.pdf)\ninstances of suspected source range interaction with targets from IP addresses geolocating to\n[Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. Most recently, RedHotel was featured in the 2022 PWC annual](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/pdf/2022-year-in-retrospect-report.pdf)\nreport (referred to as Red Scylla) and was assessed “the most prominent and prolific China-based\nthreat actor in 2022” by PWC researchers.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\n#### Victimology and Targeting\n\n**Figure 1: Observed RedHotel targeting and victimology with directly observed victimology in red and additional third-party**\nreporting on RedHotel targeting in black (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nUsing Recorded Future Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) data, Insikt Group has observed probable victim\norganizations in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Czechia, Bhutan, Hong Kong, India, Laos,\nMalaysia, Nepal, Palestine, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, the US, and Vietnam\ncommunicating with known RedHotel C2 infrastructure, with the group displaying a particular regional\nfocus within Southeast Asia by volume of victims observed. These organizations spanned academia,\naerospace, government, media, telecommunications, and research and development sectors. Of\nparticular note, in July 2022, we observed the probable compromise of a US state legislature, which\nwas observed communicating to ShadowPad and Cobalt Strike C2 IP addresses operated by the group.\n[Third-party reporting has also highlighted](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/a/earth-lusca-employs-sophisticated-infrastructure-varied-tools-and-techniques/technical-brief-delving-deep-an-analysis-of-earth-lusca-operations.pdf) RedHotel actors targeting COVID-19 research, Hong Kong\npro-democracy targets, religious minority groups, and online gambling companies.\n\nThe majority of observed victim organizations were government organizations, including prime\nministers’ offices, finance ministries, legislative bodies, and interior ministries, aligning with the group’s\nlikely espionage tasking. However, on some occasions, such as the group’s targeting of the Industrial\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nTechnology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan, [reported in July 2021, or of COVID-19 research, the](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan)\nlikely motivation was industrial and economic espionage. The group’s historical targeting of the online\ngambling industry catering to the Chinese market is also indicative of wider trends across China-based\ncyber-espionage actors observed by Insikt Group, and is likely in part intended to gather intelligence in\n[support of wider crackdowns](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3157805/china-targets-online-casinos-war-illegal-gambling-authorities) on online gambling by the Chinese government.\n\n#### RedHotel’s Multi-Tiered Infrastructure Network\n\nInsikt Group has identified RedHotel’s use of a multi-tiered infrastructure setup which is characterized\nby the provisioning of large quantities of virtual private servers (VPS) configured to act as reverse\nproxies for C2 traffic associated with multiple malware families used by the threat activity group, such\nas Spyder, Cobalt Strike, ShadowPad, and PlugX. These reverse proxy servers are typically configured\nto listen on standard HTTP(s) ports (such as TCP 80, 443, 8080, and 8443) and to redirect traffic to\nupstream actor-controlled servers. These upstream servers are then likely directly administered by the\nthreat actor using the open-source virtual private network (VPN) software SoftEther. These findings\ncorroborate previous [reporting by Trend Micro, which describes a very similar multi-layer setup in use](https://hitcon.org/2022/slides/Earth-Lusca-Revealing-a-Worldwide-Cyberespionage-Operation.pdf)\nby the group (referred to in the presentation as Earth Lusca). The group continues to [use a split](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan)\ninfrastructure setup, with the above-described configuration favored for long-term intrusion activity\nand a separate, noisier infrastructure cluster often used in initial access operations and reconnaissance.\n\nWe also observed regular communication consistent with SoftEther VPN usage between upstream\nRedHotel servers and a CHINANET IP address range that geolocates to Chengdu, Sichuan province,\nChina, per both IP WHOIS data and other proprietary data sources. A probable threat actor location of\n[Chengdu was also noted in Trend Micro reporting, where researchers observed suspected source](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/a/earth-lusca-employs-sophisticated-infrastructure-varied-tools-and-techniques/technical-brief-delving-deep-an-analysis-of-earth-lusca-operations.pdf)\nrange IP addresses geolocating to Chengdu within both SSH logs and web access logs associated with\nRedHotel web shell interaction. We also note that multiple other MSS-affiliated threat actors indicted by\nthe US Department of Justice (DOJ), such as multiple RedGolf (APT41, Brass Typhoon) operators and\n[the individuals Li Xiaoyu (李啸宇, aka Oro0lxy) and Dong Jiazhi (董家志), are also based in Chengdu (1,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\n[2,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion) [3,](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2021/05/06/an-apt-with-no-name/) [4). Both RedGolf and Dong/Li, alongside their respective front companies, also displayed close ties](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2022/07/22/chengdu-404/)\nto local universities, indicating that Chengdu is likely a popular location for MSS-linked cyber talent\ndevelopment and operations.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Schematic of RedHotel’s multi-tiered C2 infrastructure network (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nThroughout 2022 and 2023, Insikt Group tracked over 100 C2 IP addresses in use by RedHotel, with the\ngroup heavily favoring particular hosting providers including AS-CHOOPA (Vultr), G-Core Labs S.A., and\nKaopu Cloud HK Limited.

During this time, 207.148.76[.]235 served a TLS certificate with the common name\n*.itcom333[.]com, shown in Figure 5. The same TLS certificate was also historically sighted on another\nCobalt Strike C2 IP address, 158.247.198[.]252 in June 2022, which concurrently hosted a subdomain of\na known RedHotel apex domain: ozlfq7oknx.ithome[.]house.\n```\nSubject DN\nCN=*.itcom333[.]com\nIssuer DN\nC=GB, ST=Greater Manchester, L=Salford, O=Sectigo Limited, CN=Sectigo RSA\nDomain Validation Secure Server CA\nSerial Number (Decimal): 173003207651396185510653103111417659664\nValidity: 2021-07-14 to 2022-07-14\nFingerprint\nSHA-256\nf8cd64625f8964239dad1b2ce7372d7a293196455db7c6b5467f7770fd664a61\nSHA-1\ne8941d516189dc66d04a9eb6c2f063b1921e0d89\nMD5\nff54c7327daf14e0fffab48ed4ec7ce5\n\n```\n**Figure 5: TLS certificate with *.itcom333[.]com common name observed on RedHotel C2 infrastructure (Source: Recorded**\nFuture)\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nInsikt Group observed 2 droppers that ultimately loaded a Cobalt Strike Beacon payload configured to\ncommunicate with the 207.148.76[.]235 IP address:\n\n  - Dropper (SHA256):\n5cba27d29c89caf0c8a8d28b42a8f977f86c92c803d1e2c7386d60c0d8641285\n\n  - Dropper (SHA256):\n48e81b1c5cc0005cc58b99cefe1b6087c841e952bb06db5a5a6441e92e40bed6\n\nIn both cases, the samples dropped a legitimate CyberArk Viewfinity executable, vfhost.exe\n(SHA256: df847abbfac55fb23715cde02ab52cbe59f14076f9e4bd15edbe28dcecb2a348), vulnerable to\nDLL search order hijacking, alongside a malicious loader DLL and an encrypted config file. The same\nbenign vfhost.exe file has also been abused in activity we attribute to the Chinese state-sponsored\ngroup TAG-67 (Iron Tiger, LuckyMouse, UNC215, Budworm) to load HyperBro through a similar\nlow-prevalence DLL search order hijacking triad. However, we have not observed any further overlap\nbetween these 2 groups outside the shared abuse of this benign executable. In this case, both\ndroppers contain the same malicious loader DLL and encrypted configuration file:\n\n  - `VFTRACE.dll (SHA256:`\n25da610be6acecfd71bbe3a4e88c09f31ad07bdd252eb30feeef9debd9667c51)\n\n  - `bin.config (SHA256:`\n233bb85dbeba69231533408501697695a66b7790e751925231d64bddf80bbf91)\n\nAfter the loader DLL decrypts the config file, the Cobalt Strike BEACON payload is loaded into memory\nand is configured to use a customized jQuery malleable C2 profile.

We also note overlaps with public [reporting by Symantec on](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/budworm-espionage-us-state)\npurported Budworm (TAG-67) activity; however, we attribute this Cobalt Strike activity to RedHotel\nrather than TAG-67 based on the infrastructure, capability, and victimology overlap with known\nRedHotel activity.\n\n#### Campaign Spotlight: RedHotel Uses Brute Ratel in Tandem with Stolen Taiwanese Company Code-Signing Certificate and Compromised Vietnamese Government Infrastructure\n\nInsikt Group observed a late 2022 RedHotel campaign which employed a stolen code signing certificate\nbelonging to a Taiwanese gaming company to sign a dynamic-link library (DLL) used to load the\noffensive security tool (OST) Brute Ratel C4. The observed Brute Ratel C4 payload is configured to\ncommunicate with probable compromised infrastructure belonging to the Vietnamese Institute on State\nOrganizational Sciences. Notably, infrastructure associated with this RedHotel activity also served a\nstolen TLS certificate originally belonging to another Vietnamese government department, the Ministry\nof Education and Training, which is still in use by the threat actor as of June 2023.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this campaign, we observed a malicious executable named log.exe, which was first uploaded to\npublic malware repositories in November 2022.

Both of these IP addresses returned identical uncommon HTTP\nbanners on TCP port 443. Insikt Group correlated additional infrastructure observed with similar HTTP\nbanners since late 2019 onward to known historical RedHotel activity, many of which were concurrently\ndetected as PlugX C2s within Recorded Future data sets. Cobalt Strike C2s exhibiting these banners in\n2021 and 2022 were observed hosting domains spoofing a Taiwanese university and multiple Asian\ntelecommunications providers in Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Sri Lanka.\n\nInsikt Group observed multiple overlaps with known historical RedHotel activity and these banners. For\nexample, the IP address 45.32.37[.]243 was observed exhibiting similar uncommon banners and a TLS\ncertificate masquerading as Microsoft’s Compatibility Troubleshooter service (certificate SHA256\nfingerprint: 48225f022ba3f303cc7003f45cb7f7ddb6090005a31e92351bf1873d0dab736a). This IP\naddress concurrently hosted the RedHotel subdomain doc.goog1eweb[.]com, which was also used as a\nC2 domain for the group’s bespoke backdoor FunnySwitch .1\n\nWhile the above Cobalt Strike infrastructure is associated with RedHotel’s long-term intrusion C2\ninfrastructure network, Insikt Group also observed continued Cobalt Strike usage that we associate\nwith the group’s reconnaissance and exploitation infrastructure cluster described in Figure 2.\n[Previously, this cluster was largely composed](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-group-tag-22-targets-nepal-philippines-taiwan) of compromised Oracle Glassfish servers.

As a whole, People’s\nRepublic of China (PRC)-affiliated cyber operations are conducted at a considerably greater scale and\nwith a wider targeting scope compared to all other state-backed activity tracked by Recorded Future.\nSince at least 2019, RedHotel has exemplified this relentless scope and scale of wider PRC\nstate-sponsored cyber-espionage activity through maintaining a high operational tempo and targeting\npublic and private sector organizations globally.\n\nOne of the RedHotel campaigns analyzed within this report employed the use of a stolen code signing\ncertificate belonging to a Taiwanese gaming company and abused compromised Vietnamese\ngovernment infrastructure for malware command-and-control of the Brute Ratel C4 offensive security\ntool. This campaign showed RedHotel’s willingness to innovate and add additional tooling beyond its\nwell-established toolset. As noted, we also observed RedHotel targeting a US state legislature using the\nShadowPad and Cobalt Strike malware families, indicating that the group’s government targeting\nextends beyond regional interests. Based on historical precedent, we expect RedHotel to continue this\nactivity unperturbed, with the group regularly displaying a high operational risk appetite in the face of\npublic industry reporting.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n```\nDomains:\ndga[.]asia\nkb.dga[.]asia\nvideo.dga[.]asia\nsc.dga[.]asia\ndgti.dga[.]asia\nnhqdc[.]com\nmsdn.microsoft.nhqdc[.]com\nicoreemail[.]com\ndemo.icoreemail[.]com\nofficesuport[.]com\nkiwi.officesuport[.]com\ncdn.officesuport[.]com\ntest.officesuport[.]com\nmail.officesuport[.]com\nntpc.officesuport[.]com\nmain.officesuport[.]com\nexcel.officesuport[.]com\nremote.officesuport[.]com\nismtrsn[.]club\nlrm.ismtrsn[.]club\ntgoomh.ismtrsn[.]club\nnews.ismtrsn[.]club\nicarln.ismtrsn[.]club\nliveonlin[.]com\nnpgsql.liveonlin[.]com\npublic.liveonlin[.]com\ntech.liveonlin[.]com\nmain.liveonlin[.]com\ncctv.liveonlin[.]com\nalexa-api[.]com\nwww.alexa-api[.]com\nngndc[.]com\nair.ngndc[.]com\nspa.ngndc[.]com\nmkn.ngndc[.]com\nekaldhfl[.]club\nts.ekaldhfl[.]club\n\n```\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B — Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\n|Tactic: Technique|ATT&CK Code|Observable|\n|---|---|---|\n|Reconnaissance: Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning|T1595.002|RedHotel has used vulnerability scanning tools such as Acunetix to scan externally facing appliances for vulnerabilities|\n|Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Domains|T1583.001|RedHotel has purchased domains, primarily via Namecheap.|\n|Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server|T1583.003|RedHotel has provisioned actor-controlled VPS, with a preference for the providers Choopa (Vultr), G-Core, and Kaopu Cloud HK Limited.|\n|Resource Development: Compromise Infrastructure: Server|T1584.004|RedHotel has also used compromised GlassFish servers as Cobalt Strike C2s and to scan target networks.|\n|Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application|T1190|RedHotel has exploited public-facing applications for initial access, including Zimbra Collaboration Suite (CVE-2022-24682, CVE-2022-27924, CVE-2022-27925 chained with CVE-2022-37042, and CVE-2022-30333), Microsoft Exchange (ProxyShell), and the Log4Shell vulnerability in Apache Log4J.|\n|Initial Access: Spearphishing: Spearphishing Attachment|T1566.001|RedHotel has used archive spearphishing attachments containing shortcut (LNK) files which fetch remotely hosted scripts (HTA, VBScript).
