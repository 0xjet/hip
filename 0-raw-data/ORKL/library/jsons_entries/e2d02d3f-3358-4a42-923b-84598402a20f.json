    "plain_text": "# Malware Being Distributed by Disguising Itself as Icon of V3 Lite\n\n**asec.ahnlab.com/en/36629/**\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\nThe ASEC analysis team has discovered the distribution of malware disguised as a V3 Lite\nicon and packed with the .NET packer. The attacker likely created an icon that is almost\nidentical to that of V3 Lite to trick the user, and AveMaria RAT and AgentTesla were\ndiscovered during the last month using this method.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Malware using icon identical to that of V3 Lite executable\nAs shown in Figure 1, the icon looks almost identical to the actual V3 Lite icon.\n\nAveMaria is a RAT (Remote Administration Tool) malware with remote control features that\nreceives commands from the C&C server and performs a variety of malicious behaviors. It is\nusually distributed in the .NET packer form like AgentTesla, Lokibot, and Formbook to\nbypass anti-malware detection.\n\nAlthough the original name of AveMaria is WARZONE RAT, it sends the “AVE_MARIA” string\nfor authentication when performing a proxy connection with the C2 server, thereyby also\nknown as AveMaria.\n\nAdditional features of the malware and the analysis information of its binary can be found in\nthe AhnLab TIP Portal’s detailed analysis report and ASEC blog post.\n\n[AveMaria malware being distributed as spam mail](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/17692/)\n\nWhile the malware is operating, winSAT.exe (Windows System Assessment Tool) and a\ncommand for UAC privilege escalation using the winmm.dll file were found, which were\nexplained in the previous blog.\n\n[Distribution of Remcos RAT Disguised as Tax Invoice](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/32376/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. UAC Bypass behavior found in the memory when AveMaria is executed\nWhen the malware is run, it deliberately causes a delay with timeout.exe. It then performs\nadditional malicious behaviors by injecting a malicious binary into a normal Windows process\nnamed RegAsm.exe. Figure 4 shows the malicious binary inside the process.\n\nFigure 3. Process tree (injected into a normal process RegAsm.exe)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Malicious internal DLL binary found during the debugging process\nBesides AveMaria, the distribution of AgentTesla was also found. AgentTesla is an infostealer that leaks user information saved in web browsers, emails, and FTP clients. It is one\nof the most prolific malware in terms of distribution, being constantly ranked high in the\nASEC Weekly Malware Statistics.\n\n[How AgentTesla Malware is Being Distributed in Korea](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/17550/)\n\nFigure 5. RAPIT log – Snatching web browser data\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Malicious binary downloaded from an external URL\n\nprocess tree\n\n\nFigure 7. RAPIT\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon using AhnLab s infrastructure to check the related malicious files that use V3 Lite icon,\nit was found that the distribution is done actively. Most of such malicious files are distributed\nthrough attachments of phishing emails.\n\nAt the basic level, users should refrain from opening attachments in emails from unknown\nsources and update the anti-malware program to the latest version to prevent malware\ninfection in advance.\n\nAhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and blocks the malware above using the\naliases below.\n\n**[File Detection]**\n\nTrojan/Win.MSILKrypt.R495355\n\nTrojan/Win.MSILKrypt.R498085\n\nTrojan/Win.MSIL.C5152589\n\nTrojan/Win.MSIL.R500015\n\nTrojan/Win.MSIL.C515258\n\nTrojan/Win.AveMaria.R498632\n\nTrojan/Win.Tnega.C5059801\n\nDownloader/Win.MSIL.R498629\n\n**[Memory Detection]**\nTrojan/Win.AgentTesla.XM95\n\n**[Behavior Detection]**\n\nPersistence/MDP.AutoRun.M224\n\n**[IOC]**\n\nc5cb27cb09bdc222aeffaf0cccb96bad\n\nccb55c0200203e7fb4748d28c30ba2f9\n\n45.162.228[.]171:26112\n\n3280690e018ceb2112ee695933f65742\n\nhxxp://ppz.devel.gns.com[.]br/temps/donexx.exe\n\nhxxp://filetransfer[.]io/data-package/XRWqXdNN/download\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information/)\n\n[Tagged as:AGENTTESLA,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/agenttesla-en/) [Avemaria,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/avemaria-en/) [InfoStealer,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/infostealer-en/) [malware,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/malware-en/) [Phishing email](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/phishing-email/)\n\n\n-----",
