Five of these in-the-wild exploits affect default\n[Windows components, and one is a zero-day targeting MSHTML. All of them should be](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-day-exploit/)\nreviewed and prioritized quickly to protect against an attack.\n\nAlso of note: Due to the severity of one of the in-the-wild threats, Microsoft pushed out a\ncumulative out-of-band update for CVE-2021-33741 on June 4 (right before this month’s\nPatch Tuesday release). This vulnerability uses the Internet Explorer HTML engine to\nexecute commands on affected systems and could occur within any application using\nMSHTML to render HTML content. We’ve included this CVE in our vulnerability review this\nmonth under “Other Important Vulnerabilities to Consider,” as this update was released last\nweek.\n\nWith the multiple active exploits for Windows, extra consideration should be given to\nexpediting patching on these systems.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\n\n-----\n\n## New Patches for 50 Vulnerabilities\n\nThis month’s Patch Tuesday update includes fixes for 50 vulnerabilities. As with last month, it\nis unfortunate that Microsoft chose to patch a low quantity of vulnerabilities, considering the\nhigh number of active exploits occurring. And again we see remote code execution and\nelevation of privilege as the top two types of vulnerabilities, which we also saw in May. The\ncharts below show the breakdown of impact types for May and June 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Six Vulnerabilities Exploited in the Wild\n\nLet’s examine in detail the six in-the-wild vulnerabilities being exploited in this Patch Tuesday\nupdate.\n\n**CVE-2021-33742**\n\nCVE-2021-33742 is a Critical remote code execution vulnerability in the MSHTML engine,\nwhich powers Internet Explorer (IE). Although IE’s retirement has been announced by\nMicrosoft, browsing activity, while low, is still [active — hence we’ll likely still see patches for](https://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22browser%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22browsersDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222019-11%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222020-10%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D)\nMSHTML. This time, we see updates for all Windows versions: 10, 8.1, 7, Server 2019,\n2016, 2012 and 2008. CrowdStrike recommends patching this vulnerability first by installing\napplicable security updates to your platform.\n\n**CVE-2021-33739**\n\nCVE-2021-33739 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability for Microsoft DWM Core Library\ndwm.exe and dwmcore.dll. It was found and reported by researchers in the wild. There are\n[indicators of it being a variant of CVE-2021-28310. The community has attributed it to the](https://securelist.com/zero-day-vulnerability-in-desktop-window-manager-cve-2021-28310-used-in-the-wild/101898/)\nBitter APT group (tracked by CrowdStrike as HAZY TIGER), and a security patch for CVE[2021-28310 was released in April Patch Tuesday.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/patch-tuesday-analysis-april-2021/)\n\n**CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956**\n\n\n-----\n\nVulnerabilities CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956 are possibly chained together to\nachieve information leak and privilege escalation in the Windows Kernel context. Although\nthe CVE-2021-31955 is only applicable to the newer Windows 10 and Server 2019, CVE2021-31956 has patches released for as far back as Windows 7 and Server 2008.\n\n**CVE-2021-31199 and CVE-2021-31201**\n\nCVE-2021-31199 and CVE-2021-31201 are privilege escalation vulnerabilities that occur in\nMicrosoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider. These vulnerabilities were caught in the wild\nand were likely chained together with Adobe Reader CVE-2021-28550 to escape the\nsandbox. (Enhanced Provider is an essential part of all Windows systems that supports more\nrobust security through longer keys.) Related patches have been rolled out for all Windows\nversions – 10, 8.1, 7, Server 2019, 2016, 2012, 2008.\n\nFurther inspection shows that the range of attack types for this particular collection of CVEs\nincludes a remote code execution, four privilege escalations and an information leak.\nFortunately, most attackers wouldn’t be able to gain access to critical systems without an\nexisting footprint in those systems; however, it remains vitally important to prioritize these\npatches to improve your security posture for hosts containing these Windows systems and\napplications.\n\n\nRank CVSS\nScore\n\n\nCVE Description\n\n\n**Critical** 7.5 CVE-202133742\n\n**Important** 8.4 CVE-202133739\n\n**Important** 7.8 CVE-202131956\n\n**Important** 5.5 CVE-202131955\n\n**Important** 5.2 CVE-202131199\n\n**Important** 5.2 CVE-202131201\n\n### Four More Critical CVEs\n\n\nWindows MSHTML Platform Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability\n\nMicrosoft DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege\nVulnerability\n\nWindows NTFS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\nWindows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\nMicrosoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation\nof Privilege Vulnerability\n\nMicrosoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation\nof Privilege Vulnerability\n\n\nIn addition to CVE-2021-33742 already discussed, Microsoft has released patches for four\nmore Critical CVEs.\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo of these vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-31967 and CVE-2021-31985, will be updated\nautomatically, without any action required. CVE-2021-31967 is a remote code execution\nvulnerability in the VP9 Video Extensions. This component is distributed from the Microsoft\nStore and will automatically be updated if enabled. CVE-2021-31985 is a remote code\nexecution vulnerability in Microsoft Defender. This vulnerability will only be applicable if\nMicrosoft Defender is enabled on the system. According to Microsoft, this vulnerability will be\npatched under automated updates for Defender.\n\nCVE-2021-31963 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint\nServer. This is one of six SharePoint vulnerabilities disclosed this month, continuing the\nSharePoint activity seen in recent months. The remaining SharePoint vulnerabilities have\nCVSS scores ranging from 5.7 to 7.6, with impacts including information disclosure, spoofing\nand remote code execution. It’s important to note that Microsoft released a standalone set of\nSharepoint security updates to fix these vulnerabilities. These security updates are not\npatched by OS updates. Because of this, organizations should consider accelerating\nSharepoint updates.\n\nCVE-2021-31959 is a memory corruption vulnerability in the Scripting Engine. This\nvulnerability also has patches released for all Windows versions: 10, 8.1, 7, Server 2019,\n2016, 2012 and 2008.\n\n\nRank CVSS\nScore\n\n\nCVE Description\n\n\n**Critical** 7.8 CVE-202131967\n\n**Critical** 7.8 CVE-202131985\n\n**Critical** 7.1 CVE-202131963\n\n**Critical** 6.4 CVE-202131959\n\n\nVP9 Video Extensions Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability\n\nMicrosoft Defender Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability\n\nMicrosoft SharePoint Server Remote Code\nExecution Vulnerability\n\nScripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability\n\n\n### Other Important Vulnerabilities to Consider\n\n\nRank CVSS\nScore\n\n\nCVE Description\n\n\n**Important** 9.4 CVE-202131962\n\n**Important** 8.6 CVE-202131977\n\n\nKerberos AppContainer Security Feature Bypass\nVulnerability\n\nWindows Hyper-V Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\n\n-----\n\n**Important** 8.2 CVE-202133741\n\n**Important** 8.1 CVE-202131980\n\n\nMicrosoft Edge (Chromium-based) Elevation of\nPrivilege Vulnerability\n\nMicrosoft Intune Management Extension Remote\nCode Execution Vulnerability\n\n\n## The Impact and Importance of Patching\n\nWith the broad number of active, exploited vulnerabilities, organizations could be exposed\nunless they take an active role in patching the hosts containing the above-listed\nvulnerabilities. Default configuration systems are impacted and variants of the previously\ndisclosed CVEs have been uncovered — this should alert IT staff that these vulnerabilities\nare not to be taken lightly.\n\nOf course, if immediate patching isn’t possible, take appropriate action to defend your hosts\nand servers until you can install the proper security updates.\n\nFinally, if you have hosts still using Internet Explorer, take action to sunset the browser\ncompletely.\n\n## Learn More\n\nWatch this [video on Falcon Spotlight™ vulnerability management to see how you can quickly](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/falcon-spotlight-for-vulnerability-management/)\nmonitor and prioritize vulnerabilities within the systems and applications in your organization.\n\n### About CVSS Scores\n\nThe [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free and open industry standard that](https://www.first.org/cvss/)\nCrowdStrike and many other cybersecurity organizations use to assess and communicate\nsoftware vulnerabilities’ severity and characteristics.
