Qakbot), an information stealer active\nsince 2007, is known to be released consistently by its actors in\nwaves between hiatuses. In order to cover their tracks, the\nattackers use the bot to transfer encrypted stolen credentials onto\na compromised FTP server, allowing them to transfer the\nencrypted fi les at their convenience without revealing their IP\naddresses to malware researchers.\n\nBased on four months of Pinkslipbot infection telemetry, Intel\n_Security has seen infections from more than 100 unique_\nPinkslipbot versions spread across 92,000 machines in 120\ncountries, which include several medical and educational\ninstitutions as well as numerous government and military\norganizations, primarily in North America. The malware is\nknown to steal digital certifi cates, email and online banking\ncredentials, medical histories, credit card and social security\nnumbers, email addresses and phone numbers, social media\naccounts and credentials for internal resources. Such copious\namounts of confi dential information and intellectual property\nstolen from businesses (including software companies)\ndemonstrates the extent of damage the bot can cause.\n\nThis paper presents a detailed account and analysis of the\nmalware’s components (such as its ability to tunnel connections\nand transfer money directly from bank accounts), the bot’s\nincremental evolution, the potential connection with the groups\nbehind Dridex, NeverQuest and Hesperbot, and describes a key\nmistake made during the malware release process that\naccelerated our analysis. Also explained is the design of the bot’s\ndecoupled architecture that gives it resiliency to adapt to changes\nin the bot’s infrastructure.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nW32/Pinkslipbot, also known as Qakbot and Qbot, is an\ninformation harvester known to have been targeting computers\nlocated primarily in the United States since early 2007. While\nthis malware family has been around for almost a decade, casting\nit aside as obsolete and unimportant would be a terrible mistake\nas it is now more lethal than before and continues to improve\nevery few months thanks to a motivated group of developers who\nconstantly update and improve its functionality. Intel Security\ntracked the botnet closely for four months (from February 2016\nto April 2016) and detected stolen records estimated in excess of\n55 million from more than 92,000 infected machines within this\nperiod, including over 17,000 credit card numbers, several\nthousand social security numbers, and passwords for public and\nprivate web services. Considering the botnet has anywhere from\n\n\n8,000 to 13,000 machines active at any point in time, it is a fairly\nsuccessful malware family and it is little surprise that it’s still\naround.\n\n## RELATED WORK\n\nFirst seen in 2007 [1, 2], the anti-malware industry has had\nplenty of opportunities to study Pinkslipbot (henceforth used\ninterchangeably with Qakbot). While existing research on the\nmalware has covered the capabilities of Qakbot [3] and its\nserver-side confi guration [4] in a fair amount of detail, rarely is\nthe incremental evolution of the malware documented.\nFurthermore, there is little to no information about the scale of\nQakbot’s data theft operation ([5] is an exception, but having\nbeen published in 2010 the numbers are now outdated; the\nvolume of data stolen today is 2.5 times that previously\nreported). We have observed Pinkslipbot change rapidly based\non the actions of malware researchers and publications\nsurrounding it, often rendering research [6] published as recently\nas early 2016 to be out of date just a few months later.\n\nThis paper aims to add to existing literature by introducing the\nlatest advancements to this information stealer and proposing\npotential collaborative links with the actor groups maintaining\nthe Dridex, NeverQuest/Vawtrak and Hesperbot trojans. In\naddition, we refute claims of Pinkslipbot’s compression\nalgorithm being custom [7, 8].\n\n## PREVALENCE AND SUCCESS OF MALWARE\n\nQakbot has changed signifi cantly since it fi rst appeared in the\nwild, but its motives and targets have remained constant over the\nyears. Our analysis of data obtained from customer submissions,\ndetection telemetry and data sent to compromised servers\nsuggests that Pinkslipbot targets North America and Western\nEurope almost exclusively, in particular the healthcare,\neducation, manufacturing and public sector industries (Figure 1).\nThese alone account for almost 95% of all Qakbot infections.\n\n**Country** **Share of total unique**\n**infections**\n\nUnited States 84.4%\n\nCanada 8.45%\n\nGreat Britain 2.18%\n\nAustralia 0.58%\n\nFrance 0.46%\n\n_Table 1: Top fi ve countries infected by Pinkslipbot during_\n_Feb – May 2016._\n\nDespite targeting North America, Pinkslipbot has spread across\n146 countries with more than 106 unique Pinkslipbot versions\nstill active as of June 2016 (Figure 2).\n\n_Windows 7 was by far the most affected operating system_\ninfected by Qakbot until early May 2016, and has the lion’s\nshare of the total split (Figure 3).\n\nOn average, the malware is successfully able to steal over half a\nmillion records (i.e. login credentials, keystrokes, browser\n\n|Country|Share of total unique infections|\n|---|---|\n|United States|84.4%|\n|Canada|8.45%|\n|Great Britain|2.18%|\n|Australia|0.58%|\n|France|0.46%|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Pinkslipbot samples submitted to McAfee Labs by industry during Jan – Jun 2016._\n\n_Figure 2: Global spread of machines infected by Pinkslipbot._\n\n_Figure 3: Operating system distribution of Pinkslipbot infections._\n\n\nsessions and certifi cates) per day. As it targets enterprise\nsystems, it gets the most out of its botnet on weekdays (as most\ninfected machines are in all likelihood not used at weekends), as\ncan be seen in Figure 4.\n\n\nThe malware maintains an average of about 5,000 to 6,000\ninfected machines at any given point of time, which is\nsignifi cantly smaller than most botnets. To give an idea as to\nhow small that is, the Beebone Botnet still has more than 25,000\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Records stolen by Pinkslipbot over time._\n\n_Figure 5: Active infected machines in the botnet per day._\n\n_Figure 6: New infected machines in the Pinkslipbot botnet per day._\n\n\n-----\n\nactive infections per day [9] despite its takedown in April 2015\nby several global law enforcement agencies in collaboration\nwith Intel Security [10]. The attacker group struggles to maintain\nthe botnet size as most of its active infections arrive from new\ninfections, as seen in Figures 5 and 6.\n\nPinkslipbot makes up for its tiny botnet size with well-chosen\ntargets. As enterprise machines in critical industries within the\nUnited States are targeted, it manages to squeeze out vast\namounts of valuable data, including medical records, fi nancial\ninformation and corporate emails. In the four months in which\nwe tracked the botnet, it stole more than 88.1 gigabytes of data,\naveraging to around 5.5 gigabytes per week – 2.75 times more\nthan was previously estimated [5] in 2010.\n\nThe majority of keylogger data stolen by Pinkslipbot arrives\nfrom web browsers (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and\n_Mozilla Firefox, in that order), Microsoft Outlook, a popular_\nremote desktop tool, Microsoft Word and several ERP and\nmedical applications.\n\nBrowser injections yield additional valuable data for the attacker\ngroup behind the botnet. Intel Security detected a majority of\ncredentials and sessions stolen over HTTPS from websites\nrelated to healthcare, corporate web mail and social media. For\nreasons unknown to us, Pinkslipbot binaries look explicitly for\n_Facebook login credentials among few others, and the malware_\nmanaged to steal close to 60,000 Facebook profi le credentials.\n\n## INITIAL INFECTION VECTOR AND SUBSEQUENT UPDATES\n\nQakbot is usually installed on a vulnerable computer through the\n\n\nSweet Orange [11] and RIG [12] exploit kits by exploiting\nunpatched vulnerabilities in Java and Adobe Flash browser\nplug-ins. As seen in Figure 7, once the malware executes on a\nsystem, it drops an obfuscated JavaScript fi le and registers it as a\nscheduled task to run every 15 hours. The JavaScript fi le\ndownloads new Qakbot binaries from compromised domains. As\nthe delivery mechanism uses server-side polymorphism, it serves\na unique sample for every download request. Optionally, Qakbot\ncan update itself through the ‘updbot’ command (listed later in\nthis document) sent by its command-and-control (C&C) server.\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nPinkslipbot uses several loosely coupled components located on\nindependent (compromised) servers. Figure 8 shows\nrelationships between every component that involves network\ncommunication directly or indirectly with a Pinkslipbot binary.\n\nAs most components are covered in satisfying detail by existing\nresearch [4, 6], this paper focuses instead on undocumented and\nrelatively unknown information. This includes the DNS poisoning\nfeature, the connected nature of three server types and Qakbot’s\nuse of ATSEngine and Yummba (described later) to silently\ntransfer currency out of bank accounts and acquire answers to the\nsecret questions often associated with fi nancial accounts.\n\nPinkslipbot attempts to disable the web reputation products of\n_McAfee, AVG and Symantec by hooking DNS APIs and_\nreturning invalid IP addresses for the following domains:\n\n - siteadvisor.com\n\n - avgthreatlabs.com\n\n - safeweb.norton.com\n\n\n_Figure 7: Components responsible for infecting and re-infecting computers._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Components connected to Pinkslipbot samples._\n\nIt does so by hooking DnsQuery_A and DnsQuery_W in\nrunning processes and using the algorithm shown in Figure 9 to\ngenerate seemingly unique invalid IP addresses for each domain\nname.\n\n\nWhile monitoring the state of the botnet, Intel Security\ndiscovered a relationship between three of the components in\nthe diagram above: the Pinkslipbot C&C servers, domains\nhosting RIG exploit kit gates and the download servers\ncontacted by the JavaScript fi les dropped by the malware. While\nthey may be spread out geographically and have different IP\n\n\n_Figure 9: Python code used by Pinkslipbot’s DNS poisoning_\n_service to generate fake IP addresses._\n\n\n-----\n\naddresses, they in fact possess the same functionality as all three\nservers return correct responses to requests intended for the\nothers. This means that Pinkslipbot C&Cs can serve as RIG\nexploit kit gates, and vice versa.\n\nFor example, if we use a domain (engine.perksautocare.com)\nused by Qakbot’s JavaScript fi les as a part of the C&Cindependent self-update mechanism, we can contact it as if it\nwere a valid C&C server or a RIG EK gate page. Figures 10 and\n11 show screenshots of these responses from one of the known\nPinkslipbot JavaScript servers.\n\nNote that the IP address request headers have to match a certain\ncriteria [13] to get a landing page URL from the RIG exploit\ngate, but the format of the response is consistent with known\nRIG exploit gate [14] behaviour.\n\nThe cross-purpose responses are possible only if all servers\ncontain the same code base or if all traffi c is routed to a central\nserver, which acts as the master Pinkslipbot server. The only\nevidence we have of the latter is an error response (from curl)\nfrom the C&C server for a check-in request made by a\nPinkslipbot sample, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n## COMMAND-AND-CONTROL SERVERS\n\nWhile Qakbot can update itself and steal confi dential data and\ncredentials without any direction from its C&C servers (through\nthe dropped JavaScript fi le), it occasionally receives instructions\nfrom the C&C server to connect to a new NATTUN [4] SOCKS5\nproxy server and download requests for new Zeus-based\nwebinject fi les. However, the malware executable must fi rst fi nd\nan authentic C&C server before it can communicate with it.\n\n## Locating legitimate C&C servers while avoiding sinkholes\n\nPrevious versions of Qakbot, including recent variants [6], used a\ndomain generation algorithm (DGA) [15] to locate a C&C server.\nOnce a domain is generated through the DGA, a DNS NS (Name\nServer) query is performed and the resulting name server is\nmatched against a hard-coded blacklist to fi lter out sinkholes.\n\nThe sinkhole avoidance technique is listed as follows and can be\nseen in action from the packet capture logs in Figure 13:\n\n1. Generate domain name from DGA.\n\n\n_Figure 10: JavaScript download server responds as a RIG exploit kit gate._\n\n_Figure 11: JavaScript download server responds to C&C requests._\n\n_Figure 12: C&C response showing PHP error on Curl module._\n\n_Figure 13: Packet capture showing two DNS queries to check for sinkholes._\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Perform DNS NS query for domain.\n\n3. Check name servers against sample blacklist.\n\n4. If name servers are in blacklist, ignore domain and\nrepeat process from step 1.\n\n5. If name server not in blacklist, perform DNS A query\nto get IP address of domain.\n\n6. Contact IP address and make HTTP POST request to\nC&C server.\n\nDuring our analysis, we observed Pinkslipbot update its\nblacklist once it noticed a new sinkhole registered to one of the\ndomains in its DGA. On 3 April 2016, a new sinkhole with\nname server ‘ns1.alices-registry.com’ plugged into Qakbot’s\nDGA at domain wlqzitvzwq.com.\n\n\n_Figure 14: WHOIS information for a sinkhole server._\n\nWithin two days, the sinkhole blacklist was updated with the\nsinkhole name server. The screenshot shown in Figure 15\ncompares the sinkhole check routines before and after the change.\n\n\n_Figure 15: Sinkhole blacklist updated within days of the appearance of a new sinkhole._\n\n_Figure 16: Structure of a Pinkslipbot binary._\n\n\n-----\n\nIf a domain passes the sinkhole check, the sample proceeds to\ntalk to the server. As the botnet received more attention in the\nmedia [16], with reports of it infecting a Melbourne hospital\n\n[17], more sinkholes appeared within the Pinkslipbot DGA.\nPerhaps the sudden rise in sinkholes forced the malware authors\nto relegate its DGA to a backup and return to a more traditional\napproach.\n\n## Qakbot DGA as a fallback option\n\nOn 26 April 2016, Pinkslipbot chose to demote its DGA to a\nbackup measure for fi nding C&C servers. The replacement\nmechanism arrived as a list of IP addresses embedded as an\nadditional resource within the binary, as seen in Figure 16.\n\nPrior to being embedded within the binary, all resources are\ncompressed and then followed with RC4 encryption. To retrieve\nthe original resource, one must decompress and decrypt the\nresource content. Contrary to articles [7, 8] that claim a custom\ncompression algorithm is used, the malware uses a standard\ncompression algorithm disguised as a custom algorithm. Qakbot\nsamples use the BriefLZ library from Ibsen Software [18] but\nwith a slight modifi cation, which has prevented the algorithm\nfrom being easily recognized. The four magic bytes in the\nBriefLZ header (0x1AD36C61) that precede every compressed\nblock (~56K) are replaced with 0x1A7A6C62, a simple\ntwo-byte modifi cation. After using RC4 and BriefLZ on the\nfi nal resource data, the list of IP addresses is obtained as seen in\nFigure 17.\n\n_Figure 17: Hard-coded C&C IP addresses mixed with irrelevant_\n_servers._\n\n\nThe list contains anywhere from two to 60 IP addresses\ncomprising legitimate C&C servers as well as several red\nherrings. Once the list is decrypted and read by the malware\nduring execution, it contacts each IP address until it receives a\nvalid C&C response. Most of the IP addresses in the list are\nrandom and have nothing to do with Qakbot C&C servers.\nWe believe the fake C&C IP addresses are placed intentionally\nto complicate the process of generating indicators of\ncompromise (IOC) as well as fi nding valid C&C IP addresses\nto track the botnet. IOC generation with this change can\nbecome extremely tricky. Consider if the resource fi le\ncontained an IP address of legitimate and/or popular web\nservices (such as Google, Facebook, etc.). An automated (or\neven a semi-automated) IOC list containing these IP addresses\n(generated based on static or dynamic analysis), if published,\ncould potentially lead to several enterprise machines being\nblocked from these services.\n\nThis list is updated daily and at the time of writing this paper,\nconsists of more than 600 unique IP addresses, among which\nonly 28 IP addresses are real Qakbot C&C servers. In the event\nthat none of the IP addresses respond as expected, the malware\nturns to the DGA to locate an available C&C server. At this\nstage, Pinkslipbot will identify a C&C server and must now use\na special format to communicate with its C&C server without\nbeing detected.\n\n## The new communication protocol – versions 10 through 12\n\nOnce Pinkslipbot identifi es a valid C&C server, it must\ncommunicate with it without arousing suspicion from the\nwatchful eyes of system administrators and network-based\nsecurity products such as fi rewalls and host intrusion prevention\nsystems (HIPS). The Qakbot C&C gate endpoint is available at\n/t.php and /t2.php, but instead of communicating directly with\nthese endpoints, the binary obfuscates the endpoint page to\nappear random, such that /t.php would obfuscate to\nQ3tqQZsYZ6YBJq9TjR0ZRD.php. The Mersenne Twister\npseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is used with a\nspecifi c seed to ensure that the server is able to identify valid\nobfuscated endpoint URLs.\n\nOnce the gate endpoint is generated, the bot uses a special\ncommunication protocol to send and receive information. While\nthe encoding (base64) and encryption techniques have remained\nthe same, i.e. RC4 with the decryption key composed of the\nSHA1 hash of the fi rst 16 bytes from the server response and a\nhard-coded salt within the sample, the format of the response\nchanges with every protocol version. The hard-coded salt has\nbeen modifi ed for protocol version 12, as described later in\nthis section.\n\n|Decrypted C&C request (protocol 9)|Decrypted C&C response|\n|---|---|\n|protoversion=9&r=1&n={machine_id}&os=6.1.1.7600.0.0.0100 &bg=b&it=0 &qv=0300.228&ec=1655005732&av=0&salt=a56 NXqCqNnJmcAw8cJCocYPEczwUoCmrwFqRa5z|324&a56NXqCqNnJmcAw8cJCocYPEczwUoCmr wFqRa5z&43892442&updwf 1|\n\n\n_Table 2: Sample C&C communication using protocol version 9._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: Python snippet to decrypt Pinkslipbot C&C responses._\n\nAt the time of writing this paper, 12 protocol versions exist and\nare supported by all Qakbot C&C servers. Protocol versions 1\nthrough 8 are documented by Martijn Grooten [19], while BAE\n_Systems [6] describes version 9 in detail._\n\nBefore we explain the latest protocols (10, 11 and 12), we fi rst\npresent an example C&C request and response for the last\ndocumented protocol version 9.\n\nThe C&C response follows the format:\n\n{taskid}&{salt}&{dword}&{command}\n\n\nDespite taking measures to prevent connections to sinkholes,\nQakbot takes an additional step to ensure sinkholes cannot\nfake C&C requests to take over the botnet. It does this by\npassing a randomly generated salt to the C&C server when\nmaking a request. In response, the C&C server is expected to\nreturn the same salt. If the salts do not match, the command is\nignored. This is an inelegant solution as its effectiveness is\nbased on ‘security by obscurity’, i.e. it works only if a\nresearcher has not reverse engineered the sample to know how\nthe salt is used.\n\nBefore Pinkslipbot samples carry out instructions sent by the\nC&C server, they verify that the commands sent originate from\nits actor group and nobody else. While this check is fl awed for\nprotocol version 9 (and older), they got it right with protocol\nversion 10 onwards, by signing all C&C responses with the\nattackers’ RSA private key.\n\nA sample communication request and response for protocol 10\nis shown in Table 3.\n\n|protoversion=10&r=1&n= {machine_id}&os=6.0.1.760 0.0.0.0100 &bg=b&it=0&qv= 0300.468&ec=0&av=0&salt= Y8m8OJGMcztyfcwYaHhUI AKWO4vzQCjlVbIy5YHy|0&43892442&notask &eI%2BTDXLZ5V9qVL%2BMOD4D4MPiGyZ%2FwhWEZjaSre02lESF bWhDZ6dzQAKwVAc4AOyJxRS2y%2B0Q7IGFLoxROI6wo9rj5zwhsnbUl%2B6kWmEvnFihQ %2BbUGBxTqbl4r22stb2JUmFXN01LiYde7%2BLgvEKroDRevE%2FAt5GdWd5oTFeaRoctSD dyZsrhs%2Be2F7oqgmjNN1R1PFaYDh20f37rz5lEMhUVkP1PCoL%2BA5HaW2w%2B%2F13t 9eEu7rF7RJQGm1vliP8pla%2FN5mQbQvVpC3oZi3EiaC%2F7uW24HhS%2FmzsRpthupqIFOl %2BzqtAuvUUrQFAJMyzusBQqUqz0k6UVo7sjDRtVg%3D%3D&T82JiqgPMfJpgdw6cT8QEh P7o0OBhNxEEretBre2gca7tpNveCfGd9N9D3cSarTqok5DhSdMC8KSuspGBhOMsuzrpnkQq5C MnkOHJ85uJmx4koDEJHTnIGv4cvVqyBAtB6xH6qeQOktIRmrHCc7SM8KQHKidQvffVsGwx qptAKby8Oeuqs9uoI4RO3yr6Hp5tJbSGjfxuhGMbkb3etPP20cocN9OmyzdDjhgSghA4DvH4GiC gEn5MCA0mrzFqMJRpbQNhOnw6wM0r4pSBap8Mncab1vVzewgohzNn9HebHjnIoz0cOVzg4m oV7rJuyalmU1SVA49SgeeAifFbIo4CsGcP6c88GbxfE6ryemDre8JGialw3PeFvjrOme2r3ltbFBBpm BHUsJuUFOccECzLuwVTsJb106k2L1QPSj6NmK08dAUzbhR7swok5PN7bS1pMMjRLljgaQtG NCaxhbm9fxdSm0aVQhmiGtaEoRdOLG7|\n|---|---|\n\n\n_Table 3: C&C communication examples for Pinkslipbot._\n\n_Figure 19: 1024-bit and 2048-bit RSA public keys used by Pinkslipbot._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20: Signature verifi cation process across protocol versions._\n\n\nThe response format for protocol 10 is:\n\n{task_id}&{dword}&{command}&{RSA signature of\nresponse}&{RSA encrypted salt}\n\n## Response Signing Process\n\nTo sign a C&C response, the server-side C&C code generates a\nstring formatted as: ‘{task_id}&{salt}&{command}’. For the\nprevious example, the generated string would be ‘0&Y8m8OJG\nMcztyfcwYaHhUIAKWO4vzQCjlVbIy5YHy&notask’. The\nserver generates a SHA-1 hash of this string and encrypts the\nhash with its private key. Once the malware receives the\nresponse, it decodes the base64 content of the RSA signature\n(parameter 4 from the response), and decrypts its content with\nthe appropriate RSA public key embedded within itself. A\n1024-bit and a 2048-bit RSA public key are stored as a\nXOR-encrypted blob within the sample. Figure 19 shows the\npublic keys used by Pinkslipbot.\n\n\nThe client then proceeds to generate the SHA-1 of the same\nstring used by the server, and compares its generated SHA-1\nhash with the SHA-1 hash decrypted using the public key. If\nboth hashes are the same, the message is authenticated with the\nRSA signature and the sample is convinced it received the\ncommand from the attacker and nobody else. The diagram in\nFigure 20 represents this process.\n\n## Protocol versions 11 and 12\n\nProtocol 10 was retired in Pinkslipbot binaries on 5 April 2016\nand replaced with version 11. Protocol 11 is functionally\nidentical to the previous version, but uses line-separated\nnumbered arguments instead of using the ampersand symbol as\na delimiter. Example communications comparing protocol\nversions 10 and 11 are listed in Table 4.\n\nVersion 12 was introduced on 26 April 2016 with version\n0300.580, and includes two major changes compared to the\n\n|Protocol version|Decrypted request|Decrypted response|\n|---|---|---|\n|Version 10|protoversion=10&r=1&n={machine_id}&os=6.1.1.7600.0.0.0100&bg=b&it= 2&qv=0300.443&ec={dword}&av=0&salt=olAFPFjfECcW6XhxobXgI4fLjE 3Qah|350&43892442&nattun 193.111.140.236:65200&{signature_ base64}&{encrypted_salt_base64}&|\n|Version 11|protoversion=11&r=1&n={machine_id}&os=6.1.1.7600.0.0.0100&bg=b&it= 0&qv=0300.468&ec={dword}&av=8&salt=yD4ocniMY0YtwfctANOriabx59 L3f3bbH5K1ie|1=350 2=43892442 5=nattun%20 193.111.140.236%3A65200 4={signature_base64} 6={encrypted_salt_base64}|\n\n\n_Table 4: Comparison of Pinkslipbot communication protocol formats._\n\n\n-----\n\nprevious version. While it uses the same response format as the\nprevious version, it uses a new salt for encryption and decryption.\nProtocols 9 through 11 use the salt ‘KoFGsdF8^yhce(ncCxxw’,\nwhich is replaced with ‘jHxastDcds)oMc=jvh7wdUhxcsdt2’ in\nprotocol 12. This change was most likely made to force malware\nresearchers tracking the botnet to reverse engineer the malware\nagain to be able to decrypt C&C responses.\n\nThe second change enables Qakbot to receive new sample\nupdates without making an additional request. Previous protocol\nversions required the binary to send an additional request after\nreceiving an ‘updbot’ command to receive the latest malware\nbinary. Protocol 12 includes a base64-encoded version of the\nbinary directly within the response, as can be seen in Figure 21.\n\n_Figure 21: Protocol 12 sends new binaries directly in the C&C_\n_response._\n\n## C&C Commands\n\nQakbot uses the same C&C commands as its fi ve-year-old\nancestor [5], with the exception of one new, redundant\n‘wgetexe’ command. Table 5 shows the server commands\nsupported by the latest Pinkslipbot sample.\n\nNote: While the server sends ‘notask’ as a command, no such\ncommand handler exists within the binary. However, since\nPinkslipbot performs no action for commands it does not\nrecognize, the result achieved is ‘no task’. The same operation\ncan be performed with ‘getip’ or any string not found in Table 5.\n\n## Web injects lead to ATSEngine and Yummba panels\n\nOccasionally, the C&C server sends one of two ‘updwf’ (short for\nupdate web fi x/webinject) commands. This instructs Qakbot to\ndownload the latest webinject fi le from the C&C server. As of the\ntime of writing this paper, Pinkslipbot samples have received two\narguments for the ‘updwf’ command, ‘updwf 1’ and ‘updwf 2’.\n\nArgument 2 includes additional data, but due to a bug within the\ngate’s PHP source code, it returns an error instead, as seen in the\nresponse image in Figure 22.\n\n_Figure 22: Accidental error message sent by C&C server._\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|cc_main|Request and execute commands from C&C server|\n|certssave|Steal certifi cates|\n|ckkill|Delete cookies|\n|forceexec|Invoke sample with /c command line argument|\n|grab_saved_info|Save IE cookies, saved passwords for installed products, and list of installed certifi cates|\n|injects_disable|Disable web injects|\n|injects_enable|Enable web injects|\n|instwd|Infect system and set up relevant scheduled tasks and registry entries|\n|install3|Download fi le from URL and execute|\n|killall|Terminate processes by pattern matching name|\n|loadconf|Load confi guration fi le containing new C&C parameters and FTP drop locations|\n|nattun|Use provided IP address as new SOCKS5 proxy|\n|nbscan|Infect machines across internal networks|\n|reload|Restart Pinkslipbot|\n|rm|Delete a fi le by its fi lename|\n|saveconf|Encrypt and save confi g fi le to disk|\n|thkillall|Terminate all Pinkslipbot threads|\n|uninstall|Uninstall Pinkslipbot|\n|updbot|Retrieve latest Pinkslipbot binary|\n|updwf|Retrieve latest webinject code|\n|uploaddata|Upload stolen credentials to compromised FTP servers|\n|var|Save a value in the bot internal variable state|\n|getip|Is supposed to get IP address of the infected system, but does nothing in latest samples|\n|wget|Download a fi le from a specifi ed URL and save to disk|\n|wgetexe (*new command*)|Download an executable fi le from a specifi ed URL and save to disk as tmp_{timestamp}.exe|\n\n\n_Table 5: Commands supported by the latest Pinkslipbot sample._\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the ‘updwf 1’ command is sent by the C&C server,\nPinkslipbot makes another download request and receives the\nwebinject fi le. During our research, we observed two versions of\nthe webinject fi le served to infected machines\n(73204218988776f8d75e152eb39268dc3b5328bfe9f5aeffea98a3\n23e39c4b5b and 504733ec09e0fbc9ba2dc4ae5df9f01705317b13\nd4d24dc018c5b2d0a5aa3110).\n\nWebinject fi les contain JavaScript and HTML code to inject into\nspecifi c websites. In the case of Pinkslipbot, most targeted\nURLs are popular websites, online banks and investment\nwebsites.\n\nIn Qakbot’s case, the webinjects consist primarily of active\nATSEngine (Automated Transfer System) code. The purpose of\nATSEngine is to steal credit card and personal information as\nwell as silently transfer currency from infected users’ bank\naccounts into an attacker-controlled account. Other malware,\nsuch as Tinba [20], Citadel [21], Zeus [22], KINS [23] and\nothers, are all known to use the ATSEngine module to steal\n\n\ncurrency. As ATSEngine has been documented in depth [21]\n(Jean-Ian Boutin’s paper [24] is an excellent resource), this\npaper will not go into too many details about its inner\nworkings.\n\nAfter a user on an infected machine successfully logs into a\ntargeted website, Qakbot displays an error prompting the user to\nverify his/her identity by answering a few security questions.\n\nThe initial HTML inject received by Pinkslipbot is used to\ndisplay the error message, as shown in Figure 23.\n\nThe security questions include asking the user to enter credit\ncard information as well as personal information.\n\nThe user-entered information is parsed by more JavaScript\nroutines and sent to a malicious server for storage.\n\nThis information goes through sanity checks to check for its\nvalidity, and is stored in a properly formatted fashion on the\nmalicious server, which is publicly available at the time of\nwriting, as seen in Figure 28.\n\n\n_Figure 23: HTML code for fake security questions injected into banking websites._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24: Credit card information stolen via man-in-the-browser (MITB) attack._\n\n\nThousands of instances of bank account and credit card\ninformation found on the Qakbot server total up to an\neight-digit dollar amount in available currency. A portion of\nthe stolen information might be sold to resellers on carding\nforums, as we found some of the account information posted\non carding forums around discussions of conning online\nbanking tech support personnel to hand over control of\nfi nancial accounts by revealing the stolen confi dential security\nquestions (i.e. personal information). If Qakbot detects visits\n\n\nto logged in online bank accounts, the fake security questions\nare shown to the user again and all account balances are read\nand sent to the malicious server, visible to the public at the\ntime of writing.\n\nThe malicious server in question hosts a number of web panels\nfor ATSEngine, including two seemingly unique,\nPinkslipbot-specifi c panels named ‘AZ Admin Panel’ and ‘AZ2\nAdmin Panel’ containing (currently publicly visible) bank\naccount information as well as their current transfer status.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25: Driver licence information requested via MITB injection._\n\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 31, the AZ Web Panel allows the\nattacker group to add drops and transfers to initiate transfers to\nan attacker-specifi ed bank account via ACH or wire transfers.\n\nInterestingly, the server contains several Yummba [24] web\npanels (Akamai’s publication [25] is a tremendous resource for\nmore information about Yummba panels) used for stealing\nvarious forms of data (see Figure 32).\n\nBesides the AZ, AZ2 and Yummba panels, we came across a\nvaguely familiar login page that raises more questions than it\nanswers. The next section discusses a possible connection\nbetween the Qakbot authors and those of Dridex.\n\n\n## Qakbot Related to Dridex and NeverQuest?\n\nThere exists a login page on the Qakbot server that appears\nidentical to a login page documented by Buguroo [26] as\nDridex’s C&C panel.\n\nThe similarities do not end there and go well beyond the look of\nthe page. Figure 34 shows similarities in the webinject code\nobtained from Qakbot and Dridex.\n\nIt is clear from the comparison that the Pinkslipbot version is a\nvariation of Dridex’s version with more obfuscation and slight\nvariations on JavaScript array initialization.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 26: Additional personal questions are posed as security questions._\n\n\nThe Buguroo report includes a screenshot (see bottom-right\ncorner of Figure 35) pointing to a URL ‘https://{unknown}/w/a/\ngate/get_manufacturers?cb?’, which also matches perfectly with\nthe URL generated by Qakbot’s version of the obfuscated\nwebinject script. Figure 35 shows how the same URL is\ngenerated by Qakbot’s webinjects. We used a Chrome-based\nbrowser’s developer tools to quickly bypass the obfuscation\nused to hide the path.\n\nContacting the URL at the address generated by the webinject\nscript returned the same content from the screenshot in\n_Buguroo’s report. This suggests that Qakbot and Dridex are_\neither sharing the same server or using the same initial code\nbase and possibly supports Buguroo’s claim of a new actor\ninvolvement with Dridex operations.\n\n_F5 Networks found the same admin panel and JavaScript code_\nused by NeverQuest/Vawtrak as well as Hesperbot malware and\n\n\nsuggest a possible collaboration between the two criminal\ngroups [27]. This could indicate ties between the groups behind\nPinkslipbot, Dridex, NeverQuest and Hesperbot.\n\n## QAKBOT DEBUG BUILDS DISCOVERED AND COMPARED\n\nWhile tracking this malware closely from February 2016 to\nMay 2016, we noticed debug builds of Pinkslipbot being served\nthrough C&C servers on rare occasions. In each case these were\nreplaced within a few minutes with the more common release\nbuilds.\n\nWe received two debug builds directly from the Pinkslipbot\nC&C servers (version 0300.222: 0250ce491182aca4ea19a2ee63\n9ee92266a15c483069cdfe01024e5aa57c9c3c and version\n0300.226 6a61f43a322233e1c681a15e839383b4c239acfb2da\ndb77f181cd141b325e008) and obtained two other debug builds\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 27: Web inject code used to parse and validate fake security questions entered by the user._\n\n_Figure 28: Unprotected web pages contain thousands of instances of stolen confi dential personal and fi nancial information._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 29: Bank account balances and security questions are recorded by Qakbot web injects._\n\n_Figure 30: ATSEngine web panel ‘AZ2’ with bank account information and money transfer status._\n\n_Figure 31: Detailed information about banking credentials._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 32: Yummba panels discovered on Qakbot server._\n\n\nfrom 2010 (version 200.474 a0fdd16f65c09159c673e82096905a\n68b772b5efc79259f3cee4cdbba3209724) and 2011 (version\n200.332 0xab302a10005ea59c2e57b235ccb6666e800512924cf\ncaa65ac829a8566088dc0) based on strings from the fi rst two.\n\nThe major difference between a release and a debug Qakbot\nbuild is the presence of strings indicative of execution progress\nlogged either to a fi le on disk or sent to the OutputDebugString()\n_Windows API for use with a debugger. For the purpose of_\nreverse engineering, it allows a researcher to see the purpose of\na block of code without spending much time reading the\ndisassembly.\n\nPinkslipbot debug messages are typically succinct and include\nthe original function name, as seen in the screenshot shown in\nFigure 37.\n\nHaving debug versions from 2010 as well as 2016 allowed us to\nhunt for relationships between the older versions and the more\nrecent ones. Most functions from the 2010 version still exist in\nthe 2016 version with the same function names and occasionally\nwith identical generated code. In other cases, it is easy to see the\nevolution of a code fragment by studying the differences. We\n\n\n_Figure 33: Qakbot login page and Dridex login page compared._\n\n_Figure 34: Qakbot and Dridex web inject code at a glance._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 35: Qakbot web inject generates identical URL pattern to that of Dridex._\n\n_Figure 36: Comparison of the same function in a release and debug Qakbot build._\n\n\nhave no doubt that the Pinkslipbot authors have maintained the\nsame code base since its original release in 2007.\n\nThree of the most noteworthy features that have evolved over\ntime are the NATTUN proxy service, encryption technique and\nrandom number generation.\n\nThe NATTUN proxy server has upgraded from SOCKS version\n4 to version 5 (Figure 39).\n\nThe encryption used for data stolen and transferred via FTP\nservers is named internally as sxor{N}_encrypt_data_to_fi le().\n\n\nThe 2010 versions use the prefi x ‘sxor2’, which has now\nbeen replaced with ‘sxor3’ in the newer debug versions\n(Figure 40).\n\nThe third change involves a function responsible for generating\na unique directory name to store the Pinkslipbot binary after\nfi rst execution. This function generates the unique directory\nname based on the username, computer name, Windows product\nID, and the volume serial number of C:\\. Even though the\nalgorithm has not changed since 2010, the random number\ngenerator has! The 2010 and 2011 versions of Pinkslipbot\n\n\n-----\n\ndepended on MSVCRT’s implementation of the C library\nfunction rand() to generate random numbers.\n\nShortly after the Zeus source code leak in 2011, Pinkslipbot\nsamples replaced rand() with the Mersenne Twister PRNG,\nwhich is included in the Zeus leak (Figure 41).\n\nIt is not just the Mersenne Twister algorithm that has been lifted\ndirectly from Zeus. The _divI64 function from the Zeus code\n\n\nleak [28] has a byte-for-byte match with Pinkslipbot variants\nthat use Mersenne Twister (Figure 42).\n\nEarlier in the paper, we put forth a claim of possible\ncollaboration between Pinkslipbot authors and those\nresponsible for Dridex, Hesperbot and NeverQuest. The\nappearance of Zeus code after its leak makes it clear that there\nis no relationship between the group behind Zeus and the\nPinkslipbot authors.\n\n\n_Figure 37: Example debug strings from a recent Pinkslipbot debug build._\n\n_Figure 38: Evolution of the nattun_client_loop() function._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 39: Comparison of older and recent versions of a portion of NATTUN proxy code._\n\n_Figure 40: Encryption function naming conventions across older and recent debug builds._\n\n_Figure 41: Pinkslipbot samples switch to Mersenne Twister PRNG after source code leak of Zeus._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 42: Identical _divI64 functions in Zeus and Pinkslipbot._\n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nWe may have learned a lot about Pinkslipbot but it is continuing\nits evolution. Pinkslipbot has shown that, despite having a small,\nactive install-base, it is capable of causing (and has caused)\nsignifi cant fi nancial damage to individuals and corporations\naffected by it. The actors are refi ning the functionalities to cope\nwith what the AV industry has discovered and what researchers\nmay do to try to disrupt its infrastructure. As more sinkholes\nwere added, the malware moved from a DGA to an IP address\nlist to get the C&C server. Mixing valid C&C servers with\nrandom IP addresses makes this list too risky for fi rewall\ndevices to block right away. This behaviour shows that the\ngroup responsible for operating this malware is here to stay.\nPinkslipbot continues to pose challenges to anti-virus detection\nas the group behind it is in this business for a long time, and\nonly by monitoring threats like this and raising awareness in the\npublic eye to avoid infection will the AV industry be able to stay\nahead of the cybercriminals.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[1] Microsoft Corporation.
