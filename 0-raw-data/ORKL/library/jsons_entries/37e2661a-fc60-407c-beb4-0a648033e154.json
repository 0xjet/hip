    "plain_text": "# Trickbot Up to Its Old Tricks\n\n**duo.com/decipher/trickbot-up-to-its-old-tricks**\n\n## SEARCH\n\nOct 16, 2020 By [Dennis Fisher](https://duo.com/decipher/article_author/dfisher)\nJust a few days after Microsoft and a coalition of security firms took action against the\ninfrastructure used by the Trickbot malware operators, taking control of command-andcontrol servers and locking down the malicious content on them, the botnet has bounced\n\n\n-----\n\nback and is humming right along with new C2 servers in several European and South\nAmerican countries.\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft announced a coordinated takedown operation aimed at disrupting the\nTrickbot botnet, a global malware distribution and operation network that has been operating\n[since at least 2016. The takedown involved Microsoft obtaining court orders to seize control](https://noticeofpleadings.com/trickbot/files/Complaint%20and%20Summons/2020-10-06%20Trickbot%201%20Complaint%20with%20exs.pdf)\nof some Trickbot C2 servers based in the United States and also filing a copyright\ninfringement claim against the operators for misusing Microsoft’s software. The operation\nfollows a familiar road map that security companies and law enforcement agencies have\nused to target botnets for more than a decade, targeting the C2 infrastructure to cut off\ncommunications between infected machines and the Trickbot operators.\n\nThis method has worked well in some cases, but cybercrime groups have paid attention and\ntaken steps to ensure that their infrastructure is resilient and can survive a takedown attempt.\nIn the case of Trickbot, the operators have already set up a new fleet of C2 servers outside\nthe U.S., many of them in Germany, and others in the Netherlands, Colombia, Russia, and\nIndonesia. These are the first layer of command servers that infected machines reach out to,\nwith other layers of control behind them. Unlike other botnets that use virtual private servers\non bulletproof hosting services for C2, the current crop of Trickbot control servers are housed\non compromised MikroTik consumer routers.\n\n“It was a very well set up network and geographically distributed to make it hard to take\ndown. Microsoft’s action only affected the servers in the U.S., and it didn’t surprise me at all\nto see new control servers pop up this quickly,” said Mark Arena, CEO of Intel 471, a security\nfirm that tracks Trickbot activity closely.\n\n“They’ve learned from previous takedowns because Microsoft and others have used these\ntactics before.”\n\nThe Trickbot malware is often associated with the Emotet loader and recently, the Ryuk\nransomware. The operators of Trickbot sell access to infected machines to other cybercrime\ngroups, especially high-level groups that have established reputations in the cybercrime\nunderground. Those sales are not just limited to underground groups, however. This past\nsummer, Intel 471 [published research demonstrating a link between Trickbot and an attack](https://public.intel471.com/blog/partners-in-crime-north-koreans-and-elite-russian-speaking-cybercriminals/)\ngroup known as Lazarus that is tied to the North Korean government. In the linked\noperations, it appears that the Trickbot group sold access to compromised machines and\nnetworks to DPRK actors, who then used that access for their own purposes.\n\n“TrickBot certainly appears to be a source of compromised accesses that DPRK threat actors\ncan leverage. The operators or users of TrickBot seem to be well-versed in identifying\ninteresting organizations they’ve compromised for follow-up intrusion activity, be it through\nAnchor or common intrusion tools (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, BloodHound, Empire, etc.), or\nto pass off or sell to other threat actors, i.e., DPRK threat actors,” the research report says.\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin a few days of the Microsoft takedown operation this week, researchers observed the\nEmotet botnet, which sends malicious spam, delivering new spam templates to infected\nmachines. Those templates included malicious documents that eventually loaded the Emotet\ntrojan, which then contacted a C2 server to download and run Trickbot. Business as usual.\nBut that doesn’t mean the actions by Microsoft and the U.S. Cyber Command, which\nreportedly has been running its own effort to disrupt Trickbot, were futile.\n\n“From a company perspective, it’s hard for this to be effective unless you’re willing to go on\nthe offensive like Cyber Command,” Arena said. “But it’s good for the U.S. to be seen as a\nhard target for these groups.”\n\n[Botnet](https://duo.com/decipher/tag/botnet) [Malware](https://duo.com/decipher/tag/malware)\n\n\n-----",
