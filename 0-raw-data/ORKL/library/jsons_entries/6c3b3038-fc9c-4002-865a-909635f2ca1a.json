This malware can steal sensitive\ninformation like Contact data, SMS data, and files from the infected device.\n\nThe delivery mechanisms used by the Threat Actors (TAs) are through phishing or via a fake Android app\nstore; this application has an icon that is similar to the Telegram app.\n\nOnce the malware is successfully executed on the affected Android device, it can perform several malicious\nactivities without the user’s knowledge. These activities include taking pictures, recording audio, disabling\nWiFi, stealing call logs, stealing SMSs, stealing Contact data, and steal files of a wide range of extensions\n(PDF, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, txt, text, jpg, jpeg, png), etc.\n\nThe malware can also make calls without the user’s knowledge, delete files from the device, record the victim\ndevice’s screen, take screenshots, read the text content, and record incoming and outgoing calls in\nWhatsApp. Additionally, the malware checks for telecom operating out of the Middle East and specifically\ntargets them.\n\nIn 2020, APT-C-23 was also responsible for the attack on Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### APK Metadata Information\n\nApp Name: Google Play Installer\nPackage Name: org.telegram.light\nSHA256 Hash: c8d51db4b2171f289de67e412193d78ade58ec7a7de7aa90680c34349faeeee2\n\nFigure 1 shows the metadata information of the application.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 Metadata Information\nWe have outlined the flow of the application and the various activities conducted by it. Refer to Figure 2.\n\nThe application has a similar icon as Telegram official app.\nThe application asks for Contacts, call logs, and SMS permissions.\nThe application asks users to grant admin rights.\nThe application asks the users to allow access to notifications.\nThe application asks permission to install 3 party applications.rd\nThe application shows the Telegram app UI.\n\nFigure 2 Application Start Flow\nUpon simulating the application, we observed that it requests users for permissions to access Contacts, Call\nlogs, and SMS data. Refer to Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 Requests Sensitive Permissions\n\nFigure 4 shows the malware asking users for device admin activation. Once the malware gains admin rights,\nthen it can enhance its features.\n\nFigure 4 Requests for Admin Activation\n\nFigure 5 shows that the malware asks the users to enable notification access for the application. Once the\napplication gains notification access, it can read all notifications on the device, including SMS data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 Asks for Notification Access\n\nUpon receiving notification access, the application prompts users asking for permission to install 3 partyrd\napplications. Once it gains this permission, the application will be able to install other applications or update\nitself. Refer to Figure 6.\n\n\nFigure 6 Asks for 3rd Party App Installation Permission\n\nFigure 7 shows that after getting the required permissions, the malware opens a UI that is similar to the\nofficial Telegram app.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 Similar UI as Telegram App\n\n## Manifest Description\n\n**Voicemail requests thirty-five different permissions, of which the attackers can abuse eighteen. In this case,**\nthe malware can:\n\nRead, delete or modify SMSs, call logs, and Contact data.\nMake calls without user interaction\nDelete SMS data\nKill background processes of other apps\nReceive and send SMSs\nReads current cellular network information, phone number and the serial number of the affected phone,\nthe status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any phone accounts (for example: firmware accounts such\nas Samsung account) registered on the device.\nRead, delete or modify the files on the device’s external storage\nDisable the keylock and any associated password security measures such as biometric verification.\n\nWe have listed the dangerous permissions below.\n\n**Permissions** **Description**\n\nREAD_SMS Access phone messages.\n\nREAD_CONTACTS Access phone contacts.\n\nKILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES Allows applications to kill the background processes of other apps.\n\nCALL_PHONE Allows an application to initiate a phone call without going through\nthe Dialer user interface to confirm the call.\n\nRECEIVE_SMS Allows an application to receive SMS messages.\n\nSEND_SMS Allows an application to send SMS messages.\n\n\n-----\n\nREAD_CALL_LOG Access phone call logs.\n\nREAD_PHONE_STATE Allows access to phone state, including the current cellular network\ninformation, the phone number and the serial number of this phone,\nthe status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any Phone Accounts\nregistered on the device.\n\nREORDER_TASKS Allows the app to push tasks to the foreground and background.\n\nWRITE_CONTACTS Allows the app to modify the device’s contacts data.\n\nWRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to write or delete files to the external storage of the\ndevice.\n\nREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to read the contents of the device’s external\nstorage.\n\nRECORD_AUDIO Allows the app to record audio with the microphone, which can be\nmisused by the attackers.\n\nPROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS Allows the app to process outgoing calls and modify the dialling\nnumber.\n\nWRITE_CALL_LOG Allows the app to modify the device’s call log.\n\nDISABLE_KEYGUARD Allows the app to disable the keylock and any associated password\nsecurity.\n\nREAD_PROFILE Allows the app to read personal profile information such as name\nand contact information stored on the device.\n\nSYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW Allows the app to draw on top of other applications.\n\nTable 1 Permissions’ Description\nThe below image shows that the malware has defined services that can be used to read notification data on\nthe device.
