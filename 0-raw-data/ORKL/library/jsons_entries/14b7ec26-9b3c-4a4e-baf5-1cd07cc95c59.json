Proofpoint calls the two new variants recently identified “Forked” and “Lite” IcedID. This report details the\nfollowing variants of IcedID:\n\n**Standard IcedID Variant – The variant most commonly observed in the threat landscape and used by a variety**\nof threat actors.\n**Lite IcedID Variant – New variant observed as a follow-on payload in November Emotet infections that does not**\nexfiltrate host data in the loader checkin and a bot with minimal functionality.\n**Forked IcedID Variant – New variant observed by Proofpoint researchers in February 2023 used by a small**\nnumber of threat actors which also delivers the bot with minimal functionality.\n\nIcedID is a malware originally classified as a banking malware and was first observed in 2017. It also acts as a loader\n[for other malware, including ransomware. As previously published, historically there has been just one version of](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-fall-2022-return)\nIcedID that has remained constant since 2017. The well-known IcedID version consists of an initial loader which\ncontacts a Loader C2 server, downloads the standard DLL Loader, which then delivers the standard IcedID Bot.\n\nIn November 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed the first new variant of IcedID Proofpoint dubbed “IcedID Lite”\n[distributed as a follow-on payload in a TA542 Emotet campaign. It was dropped by the Emotet malware soon after the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-fall-2022-return)\nactor returned to the e-crime landscape after a nearly four-month break.\n\nThe IcedID Lite Loader observed in November 2022 contains a static URL to download a “Bot Pack” file with a static\nname (botpack.dat) which results in the IcedID Lite DLL Loader, and then delivers the Forked version of IcedID Bot,\nleaving out the webinjects and backconnect functionality that would typically be used for banking fraud.\n\nStarting in February 2023, Proofpoint observed the new Forked variant of IcedID. To date, Proofpoint has uncovered\nseven campaigns using the Forked IcedID variant. This variant was distributed by TA581 and one unattributed threat\nactivity cluster which acted as initial access facilitators. The campaigns used a variety of email attachments such as\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft OneNote attachments and somewhat rare to see .URL attachments, which led to the Forked variant of\nIcedID.\n\nThe IcedID Forked Loader, first observed in February 2023, is more similar to the Standard IcedID Loader in that it\ncontacts a Loader C2 server to retrieve the DLL loader and bot. That DLL loader has similar artifacts to the Lite Loader,\nand also loads the Forked IcedID Bot.\n\nThe following picture shows the high-level overview of the various IcedID variants Proofpoint researchers have\nidentified.\n\n_Figure 1: Overview of the three IcedID variants._\n\n**Threat Actor Details**\n\nProofpoint has identified hundreds of IcedID campaigns from 2022 through 2023, and at least five threat actors were\nobserved directly distributing this malware in campaigns since 2022. Nearly all threat actors and unattributed threat\nactivity clusters use the Standard IcedID variant. Proofpoint considers most of these threat actors to be initial access\nbrokers that [facilitate infections leading to ransomware.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads-ransomware)\n\nProofpoint continues to see all variants of the IcedID malware in campaign data, so researchers assess with high\nconfidence that the changes detailed below are not direct upgrades to the Standard IcedID codebase. It is likely a\ncluster of threat actors is using modified variants to pivot the malware away from typical banking trojan and banking\nfraud activity to focus on payload delivery, which likely includes prioritizing ransomware delivery. Additionally, based on\nartifacts observed in the codebase, timing and association with Emotet infections, Proofpoint researchers suspect the\ninitial developers of Emotet have partnered with IcedID operators to expand their activities including using the new Lite\nvariant of IcedID that has different, unique functionality and likely testing it via existing Emotet infections.\n\n[The Lite IcedID variant has only been observed following TA542 Emotet infections, but Proofpoint cannot definitively](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-fall-2022-return)\nattribute the Lite variant to TA542 as follow-on infections are typically outside of researchers’ visibility. The following are\nthreat actors frequently associated with IcedID.\n\n**TA578 – Proofpoint has observed TA578 deliver IcedID in campaigns since June 2020. Typically, this actor uses email**\nthemes such as “stolen images” or “copyright violation” to deliver malware. In addition to IcedID, TA578 also frequently\nconducts campaigns delivering Bumblebee malware. TA578 uses the Standard IcedID variant.\n\n**TA551 – Proofpoint has observed TA551 deliver IcedID in campaigns since November 2018. This actor usually uses**\nthread hijacking to typically deliver attached files including Word documents, PDFs, and recently, OneNote documents.\nTA551 has used multiple malware types, with recent payloads including IcedID, SVCReady, and Ursnif. TA551 uses\nthe Standard IcedID variant.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TA577** Proofpoint has observed TA577 use IcedID in limited campaigns since February 2021. This actor typically\nuses thread hijacking to deliver malware, with Qbot being TA577’s preferred payload. However, Proofpoint has\nobserved IcedID delivered by TA577 in six campaigns since 2022. TA577 uses the Standard IcedID variant.\n\n**[TA544 – Proofpoint observed TA544 use IcedID in limited campaigns throughout 2022. This actor typically targets](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/security-briefs/ta544-targets-italian-organizations-ursnif-malware)**\norganizations in Italy and Japan, and typically delivers Ursnif malware. TA544 uses the Standard IcedID variant.\n\n**TA581 – TA581 is a newly classified threat actor Proofpoint has tracked as an unattributed activity cluster since mid-**\n2022. This actor typically uses business-relevant themes such as payroll, customer information, invoice, and order\nreceipts to deliver a variety of filetypes or URLs. TA581 typically delivers IcedID, but has been observed using\n[Bumblebee malware and telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD) payloads. TA581 uses the Forked IcedID variant.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/caught-beneath-landline-411-telephone-oriented-attack-delivery)\n\n**Campaign Details**\n\nProofpoint has only observed the IcedID Lite Loader variant delivered as a second-stage payload following Emotet\n[infections associated with November 2022 campaigns. Below are examples of the Standard and Forked IcedID](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-fall-2022-return)\nvariants observed as first-stage payloads.\n\n**Example 1: IcedID Standard Campaign**\n\nProofpoint observed a campaign with over 2,800 messages on 10 March 2023. This campaign began with thread\nhijacked emails which contained HTML attachments. The HTML attachments used HTML Smuggling to drop a\npassword protected, zipped Windows Script File (WSF). The password “747” was displayed in the HTML file. The WSF\nran a VBScript which initiated a PowerShell command to download and execute an intermediate script which then\ndownloaded and executed the Standard IcedID Loader using a non-standard export “init”.\n\n_Figure 2: Sample email using thread hijacking to deliver an HTML attachment._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: HTML Attachment spoofing Office 365._\n\n_Figure 4: Contents of smuggled ZIP file._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: WSF file contents._\n\n_Figure 6: Intermediate PowerShell downloader.

This campaign began with invoicethemed email lures requesting confirmation from the recipient to manage a contract. The emails were personalized to\nthe recipient by using the recipient’s name in the greeting of the email. The observed emails contained the subject\n\"How can i contact you?\" with an attachment name (regex): \"unpaid_[0-9]{4}-February-03\\.one\".\n\nThese messages contained Microsoft OneNote attachments (.one). When opened, the OneNote document instructed\nthe recipient to \"open\" the document by double-clicking the button displayed in the OneNote document. An HTML\nApplication (HTA) file was concealed beneath the \"open\" text which, if clicked, executed the HTA file. The HTA file\ninitiated a PowerShell command used to download and execute an IcedID loader. The IcedID loader was executed\nwith rundll32 using a non-standard export: \"PluginInit\". The PowerShell command also downloaded and opened a\ndecoy PDF.\n\n_Figure 7: Screenshot of email sample from the 3 February IcedID campaign._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: OneNote attachment containing the “open” button that hides the HTA file._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Screenshot of HTA displayed in a text editor._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Benign PDF that appears while malicious activity is running in the background._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe IcedID loader connected to the C2 server and delivered and executed the IcedID core bot if specific conditions\nwere met.\n\nIcedID Loader Configuration:\n\nC2: ehonlionetodo[.]com\n\nProjectID: 3954321778\n\nIcedID Bot configuration:\n\n{\n\n\"date\": \"03-06-2023\",\n\n\"family\": \"IcedID Core\",\n\n\"comms_cookie\": \"01\",\n\n\"project_id\": 3954321778,\n\n\"uri\": \"/news/\",\n\n\"c2s\": [\n\n\"renomesolar[.]com\",\n\n\"palasedelareforma[.]com\",\n\n\"noosaerty[.]com\"\n\n]\n\nThis campaign is attributed to TA581, a threat actor that Proofpoint has been tracking since 2022, and officially\ndesignated a TA number in March 2023.\n\nExample 3: IcedID Forked Campaign\n\nProofpoint observed a campaign with over 200 messages conducted from 20 February to 23 February 2023. This\ncampaign included two different email lures: 1) a recall notice purporting to be from the National Traffic and Motor\nVehicle Safety Act; and 2) a violation purporting to be from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The emails\ncontained .URL attachments. A URL file is a shortcut that points to a specific Uniform Resource Locator. If the recipient\nclicked to open the .URL file, the recipient's default web browser would access the URL contained in the file. If the\n.URL file was opened it would initiate the download of a batch (.bat) file. The batch file would download and execute an\nIcedID loader with rundll32 using a non-standard export: \"PluginInit\".\n\n_Figure 11: Sample email using the motor vehicle safety lure._\n\n_Figure 12: Sample email using motor vehicle/seatbelt safety lure._\n\n_Figure 13: URL (.url) attachment displayed in a text editor._\n\n_Figure 14: BAT (.bat) file displayed in a text editor._\n\nThe IcedID loader connected to the C2 server and delivered and executed the IcedID core bot if specific conditions\nwere met.\n\nIcedID Loader Configuration:\n\nC2: samoloangu[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nproject ID: 3971099397\n\nIcedID Bot Configuration:\n\nC2: sanoradesert[.]com\n\nC2: steepenmount[.]com\n\nC2: guidassembler[.]com\n\nCommsCookie: 1\n\nProjectID: 3971099397\n\nURI: /news/\n\n]\n\n**Malware analysis**\n\nBefore comparing the Standard Loader to the Forked Loader, it is worth covering the highlights of the IcedID Lite\nLoader as there is code overlap and clear similarities when compared with the Forked Loader. For an in-depth analysis\n[of the Lite Loader, check out Proofpoint’s previous report here. The Lite Loader’s purpose is to download the next](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-fall-2022-return)\nstage of the malware from a hardcoded domain and URI path. The domain is decrypted from the configuration and the\nURI path is decrypted within the function that makes the HTTP request. Unlike the Standard IcedID Loader, there is no\nhost information being exfiltrated within the request. When the Lite Loader was dropped on Emotet infections, that fact\nmade sense, since this version of IcedID was specifically being deployed on already infected machines, and there was\nno need to check the host information.\n\n_Figure 15: Config decryption within IcedID Lite Loader._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Decryption of the URI within the IcedID Lite Loader._\n\nConsidering that Proofpoint has not observed a standalone campaign of the Lite Loader in the wild, the remainder of\nthe analysis section will compare the Standard variant to the Forked variant as well as similarities to the Lite Loader.\n\n**Loader Analysis**\n\n**Field** **Standard Loader** **Forked Loader**\n\nInternal name loader_dll_64.dll Loader.dll\n\nFileType Standard DLL COM Server\n\nExtraneous string Contains “1.bin”\n\nProject ID Project ID differs from loader to bot Project ID is the same across loader and bot\n\nRough size ~36KB ~48KB\n\nBotpack decryption Decryption is the same across both\n\n\n-----\n\nAs far as behavior is concerned, the Forked Loader functions the same as the Standard Loader. The goal is to send\nhost info to the loader C2, then to gate the bot download. This gating mechanism is to ensure that only truly infected\nmachines get the bot binary vs researchers or malware sandboxes. If the checks are passed, the C2 will return the\nencrypted bot and DLL loader which is where the real capabilities of the botnet emerge. The differences come within\nthe binary itself by how the code is/was structured and how they obfuscate the sample. Both variants of the loader\ninitiate their malicious code by creating a thread for the malware main. Before this happens though, the Forked Loader\ndecrypts and copies strings into global variables where they will be later used to resolve required functions. This\npattern of decrypting strings for future use will come up later in the analysis of the DLL loader.\n\n_Figure 17: String decryption of the DLL names used within the Forked Loader._\n\nWith the DLL strings decrypted, the malware then decrypts the loader configuration by taking the first 64 bytes and\nXORing it against the next 64 bytes. The first four bytes of the decrypted buffer will contain the project identifier (ID) (a\ncampaign identifier of sorts) and then a singular domain which is used to gate the download of the bot.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: Decryption of the config buffer in the Forked Loader._\n\nFor whatever reason, there is an extraneous “1.bin” that is appended to a string which isn’t used. As far as Proofpoint\nresearchers can tell, this string is not used and serves no purpose. With the config decrypted, the malware creates the\ncookies that contain the host information and sends an HTTP request that will contain the encrypted bot response.\n\n_Figure 19: Raw response from the loader C2 containing the encrypted bot and DLL loader._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe response gets decrypted with the IcedID decryption routine, then split into the encrypted bot (being license.dat )\nand the custom DLL loader which is generally some randomly generated filename ending in .tmp.\n\n**DLL Loader Analysis**\n\n**Field** **Standard DLL Loader** **Forked DLL Loader**\n\nExtraneous code Contains code to decrypt strings and domains related to the “lite loader”\n\nFile type Standard DLL COM Server\n\nInternal name init_dll_64.dll Init.dll\n\nRough size 20KB 36KB\n\nThe start of the DLL loader is the same across both versions of the DLL loader, a thread is created that contains the\nmalicious code for custom loading license.dat:\n\n_Figure 20: Start of the Standard DLL Loader._\n\nWhen comparing the StartAddress function, we see the biggest difference across these two samples:\n\n_Figure 21: Standard DLL Loader thread function._\n\nThe following shows the thread function for the Forked DLL Loader. This function decrypts strings that originally just\nexisted in the Lite Loader.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22: Forked DLL Loader thread function._\n\nThe rest of this report section focuses on the Forked DLL Loader, as that is where these differences exist. Just like the\nForked Loader, the Forked DLL Loader decrypts the DLL strings to be used later to resolve handles to the DLLs\nneeded. The strings are decrypted in the same algorithm where the data is split into DWORDs and XOR’d against a\nrandom key.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 23: String decryption for the DLL names needed for execution._\n\nNext, a function is called that decrypts strings that are not used at any point within the binary itself. The function starts\nby creating a structure that is going to be returned at the end of the function. This structure contains two domains and\nvarious URIs that could potentially be used to get a separate version of the bot.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24: Decryption of “Lite Loader”\" domains._\n\nFor all the Forked DLL Loader variants we have seen, there are two domains that are decrypted:\n“tourdeworldsport[.]com” and “handsinworld[.]com”. Neither of these domains are used within the file, and at the time of\nthis report have no relations on VirusTotal. Looking into the “handsinworld” domain, passive DNS shows that the\ndomain started resolving to its current IP of “193[.]37[.]69[.]107” on 12 Nov 2022. This is also around the time that\nEmotet dropped the IcedID Lite Loader onto the Epoch 4 and Epoch 5 botnet. More information on the Lite Loader and\n[Emotet can be found in our previous report here. The other domain “tourdeworldsport”, also started resolving to the IP](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-fall-2022-return)\n“5[.]61[.]34[.]46” on 18 Nov 2022.\n\nWith the domain names decrypted, the DLL Loader decrypts 10 strings that should be URIs to be appended to the\ndomains.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25: Decryption of “Lite Loader” filenames._\n\nWithin this list though, they have typos for botpackn3dat. Most likely there should be a period before .dat. This is the\nsame URI structure (/botpack.dat) that the Lite Loader used to download the bot and DLL loader from the C2 in\nNovember 2022 when it was dropped via Emotet infections.\n\nAfter the strings are decrypted, the structure referencing them is never used again. This is most likely code that has\nbeen copy/pasted from the lite loader. If implemented correctly, these strings should appear in the actual loader of\nIcedID and not within the DLL Loader where it currently resides. These commonalities between the Lite Loader and\nthis DLL Loader make it seem as if the same group that dropped IcedID via Emotet is behind these campaigns as well.\n\n**Bot Analysis**\n\n**Field** **Standard Bot** **Forked Bot**\n\nFile format Custom PE Format Custom PE Format\n\nRough size 368 KB 304 KB\n\nRemoved code Removed web injects capability\n\nVersioning Currently at version 119 Currently at version 111\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking at the Forked IcedID Bot variant and the Standard Bot variant in BinDiff, researchers observed that the\nStandard IcedID bot contains more functionality than the Forked variant.\n\n_Figure 26: Output of BinDiff showing the Standard Bot vs the Forked Bot._\n\nCombining Hexray’s Lumina and BinDiff shows that the Standard Bot contains functionality relating to web injects,\nadversary in the middle (AiTM) and backconnect capabilities that do not exist within the Forked variant. This could be\nbecause banking fraud has become increasingly more difficult over the last couple of years.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 27: Functions that have been removed within the Forked Bot._\n\nWithin the communications of the bot, there is an authentication header which contains the bot’s project ID, some other\ndetails and the version of the bot.\n\nAuthorization: Basic OTk4MDc1MzAwOjA6MTE5OjY1OjM1\n\n998075300:0:119:65:35\n\nBase64 decoding this value gives up the version as the third component of the list. For the Standard IcedID Bot, this\nvalue is set to 119 as seen above, but for the Forked variant, we get the following base64 decoded header;\n\n998075300:0:111:67:1\n\nThis value contains version 111, which could indicate the fork happened when the Standard Bot was using that version.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, there seems to be a bug within the Forked variant of the bot where the URIs of specific requests are not\nconstructed properly which causes 404s to occur.\n\n_Figure 28: Network requests made by the Forked Bot._\n\nIn the example above, the request should be “/news/4/2/1” but for whatever reason the bot does not append the initial /\nfor specific commands.\n\n**Lite Loader Anomaly**\n\n[After analysis of the separate variants was finished, Proofpoint identified a file called “botpackn1.dat” on VirusTotal that](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7c8b3b8cf2b721568b96f58e5994b8ddb8990cd05001be08631ade7902ae6262)\nseemed related to our Lite Loader.\n\n_Figure 29: VirusTotal page showing the botpack used in the Lite Loader._\n\n\n-----\n\nThat filename is embedded within the custom Forked DLL Loader mentioned previously. This relationship was enough\n[to prompt further analysis. In the article where Proofpoint described the IcedID Lite Loader being dropped via Emotet](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/comprehensive-look-emotets-fall-2022-return)\ninfections, researchers documented the structure of the botpack format and how to decrypt it as well. Taking that same\nscript and applying it to this file leads to a valid configuration where researchers can analyze the configuration.\n\n_Figure_\n\n_30: Commandline output showing the decrypted botpack structure._\n\nThis botpackn1.dat contains the later stages of the infection chain, so with some pivoting on the VirusTotal\n[relationships, researchers land on the distribution URL (VT Link) “http[:]//lepriconloots[.]com/botpackn1.dat”. Pivoting](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/e6426ab8889d3284160de0c785342bda6c8b47835cc16ec085e7e625adf71d21)\n[again to find files that reach to the URL, we come across the Lite Loader sample itself. Looking at the build artifacts of](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4871d83c32ce40c24171ec40c4548dd320fe183a58d3866aa88c0b12d2d7b3ae)\nthis sample, it seems like the threat actors have removed the PDB path, but the Lite Loader still contains the build\nname “Loader.dll”. Loader.dll was initially used within IcedID to refer to the Lite Loader back when it was dropped via\nEmotet infections in November, but that same build name is now being used within the Forked DLL Loader. This could\nmean the codebase is similar enough where the threat actors can interchange the loader and the DLL Loader, or that\nthese actors are copy/pasting extraneous code.\n\n_Figure 31: Embedded build name of the DLL Loader._\n\nFinally, pivoting on where this “c2.dll” (IcedID Lite loader) came from, the distribution URL\n“http[:]//104[.]156[.]149[.]6/webdav/c2.dll” is observed. Similarly, this IP address hosted an IcedID campaign from\nTA581 that occurred on 21 February 2023. The TA581 campaign ended up loading the DLL “host.dll” from that same\ndirectory and led to one of the first campaigns of Proofpoint observing the Forked variant. At the time when this\ndistribution URL was live the IP was hosting an open directory on /webdav/ that contained various bat files, a forked\nIcedID loader as well as this lite loader.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIcedID is a popular malware typically used by more advanced cyber criminal threat actors, and its use across the threat\nlandscape has remained relatively consistent until recently. Ultimately, there seems to be considerable effort going into\nthe future of IcedID and the malware’s codebase, including the addition of two new variants described in this report.\nWhile historically IcedID’s main function was a banking trojan, the removal of banking functionality aligns with the\noverall landscape shift away from banking malware and an increasing focus on being a loader for follow-on infections,\nincluding ransomware.\n\nProofpoint anticipates that while many threat actors will continue to use the Standard variant, it is likely the new\nvariants will continue to be used to facilitate additional malware attacks.\n\n**ET Rules**\n\nET MALWARE Win32/IcedID Request Cookie\n\nETPRO MALWARE Win32/IcedID Stage2 Checkin\n\nETPRO MALWARE Win32/IcedID Stage2 CnC Activity\n\nETPRO MALWARE Win32/IcedID Stage2 CnC Activity M2 (GET)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Description** **Date**\n**Observed**\n\nehonlionetodo[.]com C2 IcedID Loader February\n2023\n\nsamoloangu[.]com C2 IcedID Loader February\n20-23,\n2023\n\nsanoradesert[.]com C2 IcedID Bot February\n20-23,\n2023\n\nsteepenmount[.]com C2 IcedID Bot February\n20-23,\n2023\n\nguidassembler[.]com C2 IcedID Bot February\n20-23,\n2023\n\nrenomesolar[.]com C2 IcedID Bot February\n3, 2023\n\npalasedelareforma[.]com C2 IcedID Bot February\n3, 2023\n\nnoosaerty[.]com C2 IcedID Bot February\n3, 2023\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp[://]helthbrotthersg[.]com/view[.]png URL HTA Payload\nURL\n\nhxxp[://]104[.]156[.]149[.]6/webdav/c2[.]dll URL Staging URL\nfor Lite\nLoader\n\nhxxp[://]lepriconloots[.]com/botpackn1[.]dat URL Staging URL\nfor the IcedID\nbot\n\nhxxp[://]94[.]131[.]11[.]141/webdav/Labels_FDA_toCheck[.]bat URL .URL File\nPayload URL\n\nhxxp[://]94[.]131[.]11[.]141/webdav/fda[.]dll URL BAT Payload\nURL\n\nRecall_2.22.url filename .URL\nAttachment\n\nfeb20_fda_labels-violation.url filename .URL\nAttachment\n\ndc51b5dff617f4da2457303140ff1225afc096e128e7d89454c3fa9a6883585c SHA256 .URL\nAttachment\n\n\nFebruary\n3, 2023\n\nFebruary\n22, 2023\n\nFebruary\n22, 2023\n\nFebruary\n20-23,\n2023\n\nFebruary\n20-23,\n2023\n\nFebruary\n20-23,\n2023\n\nFebruary\n20-23,\n2023\n\nFebruary\n20-23,\n2023\n\n\n7c8b3b8cf2b721568b96f58e5994b8ddb8990cd05001be08631ade7902ae6262 SHA256 Botpackn1.dat February\n22, 2023\n\n\nfbad60002286599ca06d0ecb3624740efbf13ee5fda545341b3e0bf4d5348cfe SHA256 IcedID\nStandard\nLoader\n\n\nFebruary\n3, 2023\n\n\n03fdf03c8f0a0768940c793496346253b7ccfb7f92028d3281b6fc75c4f1558e SHA256 HTA February\n3, 2023\n\n9bf40256fb7f0acac020995a3e9a231d54a6b14bb421736734b5815de0d3ba53 SHA256 WSF March 10,\n2023\n\nbefeb1ab986fae9a54d4761d072bf50fdbff5c6b1b89b66a6790a3f0bfc4243f SHA256 DLL March 10,\n2023\n\n\nhxxp[://]segurda[.]top/dll/loader_p1_dll_64_n1_x64_inf[.]dll53[.]dll URL Staging URL\nfor Standard\nLoader\n\n\nMarch 10,\n2023\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp[://]segurda[.]top/gatef[.]php URL PowerShell\nPayload URL\n\nconsumption_8581_march-10.html Filename HTML\nAttachment\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\nMarch 10,\n2023\n\nMarch 10,\n2023\n\n\n-----",
