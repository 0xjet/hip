Targeting the computer giant Acer,\nthe actors behind the ransomware asked for 50 million dollars, the highest ransom they have\ndemanded so far. Acer was not the only victim of the notorious ransomware. Debuted in April\n2019, REvil has attacked hundreds of high-profile agencies in multiple sectors. In 2020,\nREvil has earned more than 100 million.[1] In this report, we will introduce the basic profile of\nREvil and share the techniques they used in operations.\n\n## What is REvil\n\nREvil, a.k.a Sodinokibi, is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation deployed by a\nRussian cybercrime group named GOLD SOUTHFIELD or Pinchy Spider. The group is\nbelieved to be based in Russia, as it does not attack organizations in Post-Soviet States, and\nrefuse to cooperate with English speaking cyber criminals.[2]\n\n\n-----\n\nREvil was highly possible the successor of GandCrab, another notorious ransomware,\nbecause of code similarities and REvil's active operations right after GandCrab's retirement.\n\n[3]\n\n_Figure 1: The timeline of REvil's appearance and GandCrab's retirement_\n\n_Figure 2: REvil and GandCrab's similarity on string decoding_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: REvil and GandCrab's similarity on building ransom wallpaper_\n\nNumerous campaigns attacking multiple sectors were observed all over the world. The REvil\nactors has attacked local governments, giant law firms, multinational retailers, etc. The\nhighest ransom they have asked was 42 million for the law firm but was now surpassed by\nthe 50 million Acer attack. (References for the events, please see the end of this page.[4])\n\n_Figure 4: The timeline of REvil's notorious attacks_\n\n## The Ransomware as a Service model (RaaS)\n\nThe actors of REvil adopt the Ransomware as a Service business model. In this model,\nRansomware developers are responsible for development and maintenance of the\nransomware, while the groups of cyber criminals, named affiliates in this model, are\n\n\n-----\n\nresponsible for accessing victims system to distribute the ransomware. The business model\nallows cyber criminals who are not capable of developing their own ransomware to buy the\nservice on dark web and deploy ransomware attack.\n\nThrough this model, REvil actors provide REvil or the customized version of REvil to their\naffiliates. After they successfully breached victims' systems, REvil actors will ask for ransom\nby themselves, providing the ransom payment link. After the collection of money, their\naffiliates will receive 60% to 75% of the profit. Moreover, the actors also provide other paid\nservices, such as money laundering assistance for the affiliates.\n\n## Tactic, Techniques and Procedures\n\n\n-----\n\n### Initial Access\n\nFor REvil, different affiliates may use different methods for initial access. The ransomware is\nnow distributed primarily through compromised RDP sessions (65%), phishing (16%), and\nsoftware vulnerabilities (8%).[5] However, a supply chain attack distributing REvil was also\nobserved.\n\nREvils' actors said in an interview that they used brute force attacks to compromise RDP\nsessions.[1] As for phishing emails, the cyber criminals have once disguised their email as a\nnew booking from \"booking.com\". They also exploit vulnerabilities. In fact, REvil's debut was\nexploiting the Oracle Weblogic vulnerability, CVE-2019-2725. Moreover, the actors are able\nto deploy new vulnerabilities after its disclosure. For example, the group used the recent\ndisclosed Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability to access Acer's system.\n\nThe most astounding technique they deployed is supply chain attack. Around June 2019, a\nWINRAR distributor site in Italy was hacked.[6][7] The software downloaded from the site at\nthat time was not the WINRAR installer but the REvil installer. Although no public\nannouncements showing that any company was infected in this attack, the successful\nreplacement shows that their affiliates were able to deploy a supply chain attack.\n\nApart from their various method on initial access, the cyber criminals also adopted several\nunique techniques. For example, REvil used Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange to\nencrypt files, while other ransomware often used RSA, Salsa20 or AES to do so. This\nmethod is more efficient as it used shorter key and is difficult to decrypt.\n\n## The Effective Methods for Ransom Collection\n\nNowadays, as ransomware attacks become a serious problem, most companies have\nlearned to back up crucial data in case they are hit by a ransomware. However, ransomware\nactors develop several new methods to ensure that the victims will pay the ransom, including\nDouble-extortion, VoIP calling, and DDoS attack.\n\n\"Double-extortion\" The actors disclose or sell the data of the company if the company is\nnot willing to pay ransom. This method was first introduced by Maze, another notorious\nransomware, and currently almost all ransomware actors have adopted this method,\nand so as REvil. Starting from January 2020, the group runs their own site \"Happy\nBlog\", where they post data extorted from their victims.\n\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling In February 2021, they announced that they\nare now offering Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling and DDoS attack service for\ntheir affiliates to make pressure on their victims.[8] They stated that they will call the\nmedia or their victims' business partners, telling them about the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Detect and Defense\n\nFor prevention, it is always crucial to be aware of spamming emails. Nowadays, spamming\nemails is still the most popular and effective method to access victims' computers.\n\nIn addition, keep an eye on new exploits and updates is also important. Ransomware groups\nusually are not capable of discovering 0-day exploits by themselves, but they will exploit the\ndisclosed vulnerabilities and attack those who have not updated their system. Thus, keep\ncomputers updated and patched systems immediately after the disclosure is essential for\npreventing ransomware attack.\n\nFurthermore, as the REvil business grows, the actors behind has posted on dark web to\nrecruit more affiliates for their operations. Thus, more attacks from the group is expected.\nTeamT5 will keep following the ransomware and provide up-to-date information of the\nnotorious ransomware.\n\nTo efficiently prevent ransomware attacks, TeamT5 offers a total solution for enterprise\nprotection. Our unique ransomware containment technology is proven to successfully block\nmany types of ransomware, which can detect and stop malicious ransomware immediately.\nAnd even restore encrypted files from the backup.\n\nFor more information about TeamT5 Ransomware Prevention total solution, please contact:\n\n[[email protected]](https://teamt5.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b1c2d0ddd4c2f1c5d4d0dcc5849fdec3d6)\n\n## References\n\n[1] https://therecord.media/i-scrounged-through-the-trash-heaps-now-im-a-millionaire-aninterview-with-revils-unknown/\n\n[2] [https://www.advintel.io/post/inside-revil-extortionist-machine-predictive-insights](https://www.advintel.io/post/inside-revil-extortionist-machine-predictive-insights)\n\n[3] [https://www.zdnet.com/article/gandcrab-ransomware-operation-says-its-shutting-down/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gandcrab-ransomware-operation-says-its-shutting-down/)\n\n[4] Texas Municipalities - https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-least-20-texas-local-governmentshit-in-coordinated-ransomware-attack/; Backup Company [https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-hits-hundreds-of-dentist-offices-in-the-us/;](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-hits-hundreds-of-dentist-offices-in-the-us/)\n[Foreign Exchange Company - https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51017852; US Law Firm](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51017852)\n- https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-asks-42m-from-ny-law-firm-threatens-toleak-dirt-on-trump/; Pan-Asia Retailer https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pan-asian-retail-giant-dairy-farm-suffersrevil-ransomware-attack/\n\n[5] https://www.csoonline.com/article/3597298/revil-ransomware-explained-a-widespreadextortion-operation.html\n\n\n-----\n\n[6] https://www.drcommodore.it/2019/06/20/hackerato-winrar-it-malware-al-posto-delprogramma/\n\n[7] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-spreads-widevia-hacked-msps-sites-and-spam/\n\n[8] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-plans-to-call-victimsbusiness-partners-about-attacks/\n[*Image courtesy of Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)\nShare:\n\n### Related Post\n\n\n-----",
