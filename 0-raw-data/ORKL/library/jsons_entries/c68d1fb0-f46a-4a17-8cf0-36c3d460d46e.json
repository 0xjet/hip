MageCart is malicious code used by attackers to steal credit card\ndetails and other information from e-commerce sites when a user submits a form.\n\nIn order to use the Feedify service, e-commerce sites need to add a Feedify JavaScript script\nto their site. If the Feedify script is compromised with MageCart, any visitors who go to ecommerce site that uses the Feedify script will also load the malicious code.\n\nThis hack was first noticed by a security researcher named Placebo who posted about it\nyesterday on Twitter. When Placebo posted about it, MageCart had already been removed\nfrom the Feedify script.\n\nMagecart on Feedify. A customer engagement tool. According to there website 4000+ website\n[use there tooling/code. Fixed today after I notified them.@ydklijnsma](https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@GossiTheDog](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[pic.twitter.com/K2czXkUoHD](https://t.co/K2czXkUoHD)\n\n— Placebo (@PlaceboRulez) [September 11, 2018](https://twitter.com/PlaceboRulez/status/1039585013057118209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWhen researching this story, I created a Feedify account to test what scripts their customers\nwere being instructed to add. When testing the service, customers are instructed to add the\nfollowing snippet of code to their site\n\n\n-----\n\nCaption\n\nWhen examining the https://cdn.feedify.net/getjs/feedbackembad-min-1.0.js script, though,\nI saw that MageCart was still embedded in the script as shown by the highlighted section\nbelow.\n\nCaption\n\nA partial deobfuscation of the script shows that any submitted information will be sent to the\nURL https://info-stat.ws/js/slider.js.\n\n\n-----\n\nCaption\n\n[To confirm that this was indeed MageCart, I contacted Yonathan Klijnsma of RiskIQ who](https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma)\nfurther confirmed that the Feedify script was still compromised. Klijnsma told\nBleepingComputer that the script had been reinfected 15 minutes prior to my contacting\nhim.\n\nFYI: Feedify is re-infected with Magecart since about an hour ago, exact time of infection is:\nWed, 12 Sep 2018 14:16:02 GMT.\n\nURL: hxxps://cdn[.]feedify[.]net/getjs/feedbackembad-min-1.0.js\n\n/cc @Placebo52510486 [@GossiTheDog](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@_feedify](https://twitter.com/_Feedify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [https://t.co/4DtpP3l0Wd](https://t.co/4DtpP3l0Wd)\n\n— Yonathan Klijnsma (@ydklijnsma) [September 12, 2018](https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma/status/1039896950223429632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nCurrently the malicious code has been removed from\nthe https://feedify.net/getjs/feedbackembad-min-1.0.js, but it is still present\nin https://cdn.feedify.net/getjs/feedbackembad-min-1.0.js.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Feedify for further information, but has not received a\nresponse at the time of this publication.\n\n## MageCart used in recent British Airways hack\n\n\n-----\n\nRiskIQ also discovered that a script used by British Airways was also recently\ncompromised by the MageCart script. This allowed attackers to steal payment and other\nsensitive information from approximately 380,000 individuals.\n\nIn the British Airways hack, the compromised script was the Modernizr JavaScript library,\nwhich airline's site was using.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft: Credit card stealers are getting much stealthier](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-credit-card-stealers-are-getting-much-stealthier/)\n\n[Caramel credit card stealing service is growing in popularity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/caramel-credit-card-stealing-service-is-growing-in-popularity/)\n\n[Hacked WordPress sites force visitors to DDoS Ukrainian targets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacked-wordpress-sites-force-visitors-to-ddos-ukrainian-targets/)\n\n[Refine your JavaScript knowledge with this training bundle deal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/offer/deals/refine-your-javascript-knowledge-with-this-training-bundle-deal/)\n\n[Ukraine targeted by DDoS attacks from compromised WordPress sites](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-targeted-by-ddos-attacks-from-compromised-wordpress-sites/)\n\nAD\n\n[Feedify](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/feedify/)\n[Hacked](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hacked/)\n[JavaScript](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/javascript/)\n[MageCart](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/magecart/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
