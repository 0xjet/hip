Cobalt Strike is a legitimate security tool used by penetration testers to emulate threat\nactor activity in a network. However, it is also increasingly used by malicious actors –\nProofpoint saw a 161 percent increase in threat actor use of the tool from 2019 to 2020. This\n[aligns with observations from other security firms as more threat actors adopt hacking tools](https://www.recordedfuture.com/2020-adversary-infrastructure-report/)\nin their operations.\n\n[When mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Proofpoint’s visibility into the attack](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)\n[chain focuses on Initial Access, Execution, and Persistence mechanisms. That is: How are](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/first-step-initial-access-leads-ransomware)\nthreat actors attempting to compromise hosts and what payloads are they deploying\nfirst? Our corpus of threat actor data includes criminal and state-associated threat\nactor groups. Based on our data, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that Cobalt Strike\nis becoming increasingly popular among threat actors as an initial access payload, not just a\nsecond-stage tool threat actors use once access is achieved, with criminal threat actors\nmaking up the bulk of attributed Cobalt Strike campaigns in 2020.\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December 2020, the world learned about an expansive and effective espionage campaign\nthat successfully backdoored the popular network monitoring software SolarWinds.\n[Investigators revealed tools used by the threat actors included Cobalt Strike Beacon. This](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\ncampaign was attributed to threat actors working for Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service –\n[a group with Cobalt Strike in their toolbox since at least 2018. This high-profile activity was](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html)\npart of a clever attack chain enabling advanced threat actors to surreptitiously compromise a\nrelatively small number of victims. The tool used, and customized to fit their needs, is almost\na decade old but increasingly popular.\n\nCobalt Strike [debuted in 2012 in response to perceived gaps in an existing red team tool, the](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2016/03/02/a-history-of-cobalt-strike-in-training-courses/)\nMetasploit Framework. In 2015, Cobalt Strike 3.0 launched as a standalone adversary\nemulation platform. By 2016, Proofpoint researchers began observing threat actors using\nCobalt Strike.\n\nHistorically, Cobalt Strike use in malicious operations was largely associated with well[resourced threat actors, including large cybercrime operators like TA3546 (also known as](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=257dd693-5986-41bf-bc33-f9dc76d9c6a8&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n[FIN7), and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups such as TA423 (also known as](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leviathan-espionage-actor-spearphishes-maritime-and-defense-targets)\nLeviathan or APT40). Proofpoint researchers have attributed two-thirds of identified Cobalt\nStrike campaigns from 2016 through 2018 to well-resourced cybercrime organizations or\nAPT groups. That ratio decreased dramatically the following years – between 2019 and\npresent, just 15 percent of Cobalt Strike campaigns were attributable to known threat\nactors.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Number of email messages associated with a Cobalt Strike payload observed_\n_over time. Note: 2021 figures include data through May 2021._\n\nThreat actors can obtain Cobalt Strike in a variety of ways: purchasing it directly from\nthe vendor’s website, which requires verification; buying a version on the dark\nweb via various hacking forums; or using cracked, illegitimate versions of the software. In\nMarch 2020, a cracked version of Cobalt Strike 4.0 was released and made available to\nthreat actors.\n\n## Cobalt Strike’s Appeal\n\nCobalt Strike is used by a diverse array of threat actors, and while it is not unusual for\ncybercriminal and APT actors to leverage similar tooling in their campaigns, Cobalt Strike is\nunique in that its built-in capabilities enable it to be quickly deployed and operationalized\nregardless of actor sophistication or access to human or financial resources. The job of\nsimulating actor attacks and penetrating defenses might become a bit more straightforward\nwhen both sides are using the same tool.\n\nCobalt Strike is also session-based — that is, if threat actors can access a host and\ncomplete an operation without needing to establish ongoing persistence, there will not be\nremaining artifacts on the host after it is no longer running in-memory. In essence: they can\nhit it and forget it.\n\nThreat actors can also use the malleability of Cobalt Strike to create customized builds that\nadd or remove features to achieve objectives or evade detection. For example, APT29\n[frequently uses custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders to blend in with legitimate traffic](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html)\nor [evade analysis.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\n\nFor defenders, customized Cobalt Strike modules often require unique signatures, so threat\ndetection engineers may be required to play catch-up to Cobalt Strike use in the wild. Cobalt\nStrike is also appealing to threat actors for its inherent obfuscation. Attribution gets more\ndifficult if everyone is using the same tool. If an organization has a red team actively making\nuse of it, it is possible malicious traffic could be mistaken as\nlegitimate. The software’s ease of use can improve the capabilities of less sophisticated\nactors. For sophisticated actors, why spend development cycles on something new when\nyou already have a great tool for the job?\n\nProofpoint data shows Cobalt Strike is a popular tool for everything from strategic\ncompromises to noisy, widespread campaigns. The following examples illustrate a small\nsampling of the types of threat actors leveraging Cobalt Strike tracked by Proofpoint.\n\n## Threat Actors\n\n**TA800**\n\n\n-----\n\nTA800 is a large crimeware group tracked by Proofpoint since mid-2019. This actor attempts\nto deliver and install banking malware or malware loaders, including The Trick\nand BazaLoader. In April 2020, TA800 became the first group observed\ndistributing BazaLoader. In these early campaigns, the threat actor distributed emails with a\nmalicious link to an executable or a landing page hosted on Google Docs with a link to an\nexecutable. The executable downloaded the BazaLoader backdoor which in turn\ndownloaded Cobalt Strike. In February 2021, the group pivoted to distributing Cobalt Strike\nas a first-stage payload via malicious URLs. There has been some evidence\nsuggesting TA800’s [NimzaLoader is being used to download and execute Cobalt Strike as its](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/nimzaloader-ta800s-new-initial-access-malware)\nsecondary payload.\n\n**TA547**\n\nTA547 is a crimeware actor tracked by Proofpoint since October 2017. This group appears to\nbe interested in distributing primarily banking trojans – including The Trick and ZLoader – to\nvarious geographic regions. Since mid-2020, this actor favors using malicious\nMicrosoft Office attachments to distribute malware. In February 2021, TA547 began\ndistributing Cobalt Strike as a second-stage payload for command and control.\n\n**TA415**\n\nTA415 is an APT actor believed to be associated with People’s Republic of\nChina (PRC) state interests. The group has been noted in United States court filings to be\ntied to PRC’s Ministry of State Security. TA415 is also known as Barium and\nAPT41. Proofpoint identified TA415 delivering Cobalt Strike as a first-stage payload in limited\ncampaigns during mid-2020. In September 2020, the United States Department of Justice\nannounced the indictment of several threat actors associated with this threat group,\n[and detailed the threat actors use of Cobalt Strike in the indictment. Based on](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\nrecent [reporting by Group-IB, TA415 used Cobalt Strike in a campaign against an entity in](https://blog.group-ib.com/colunmtk_apt41)\nthe airlines sector.\n\nThe following timeline provides a small sample of threat actor use of Cobalt Strike across\ncybercrime and APT threats. The selected events were identified based on their significance,\nand are not representative of the full Cobalt Strike threat landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Timeline of threats using Cobalt Strike. Links to the sources are available in the_\n_References section._\n\n## Attack Chain\n\nProofpoint has observed dozens of threat actors using Cobalt Strike. However, like their\nlegitimate counterparts, threat actors exhibit many attack paths and use cases of\nthe malicious actor emulation software. Threat actors use different lure themes, threat types,\ndroppers, and payloads. For example, the earliest Cobalt Strike campaigns distributed email\nthreats with malicious document attachments to distribute the malware, but campaigns\ndistributing malicious URLs directly in the email body have overtaken attachments as the\nmore frequently utilized threat type.\n\nWhile instances of Cobalt Strike being sent directly as an initial payload have dramatically\nincreased, deployment as a second stage payload remains popular. Cobalt Strike has been\nobserved in a variety of attack chains alongside malware such as The\nTrick, BazaLoader, Ursnif, IcedID, and many more popular loaders. In these cases, the\npreceding malware typically loads and executes Cobalt Strike. Likewise, there is a wide array\nof techniques leveraged in cases where Cobalt Strike is delivered directly, such as via\nmalicious macros in weaponized Office documents, compressed executables, PowerShell,\ndynamic data exchange (DDE), HTA/HTML files, and traffic distribution systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter Cobalt Strike has been executed and a Beacon established for C2 communication,\nactors have been observed attempting to enumerate network connections and dumping\nActive Directory credentials as they try to move laterally to a network resource such as a\nDomain Controller, allowing for deployment of ransomware to all networked systems. For\n[example, the Cobalt Strike documentation states:](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon)\n\nUse the net dclist command to find the Domain Controller for the domain the target is joined\nto. Use the net view command to find targets on the domain the target is joined to.\n\nIn addition to network discovery and credential dumping, Cobalt Strike Beacon also has the\ncapability to elevate privileges, load and execute additional tools, and to inject these\nfunctions into existing running host processes to attempt to avoid detection.\n\n## Outlook\n\nProofpoint researchers anticipate Cobalt Strike will continue to be a commonly used tool in\nthreat actor toolsets. According to internal data, tens of thousands of organizations have\nalready been targeted with Cobalt Strike, based on observed campaigns. We expect this\nnumber to increase in 2021.\n\n_Figure 3: Number of customers targeted by threats using Cobalt Strike_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCobalt Strike is a useful tool, for legitimate security researchers and threat actors alike. Its\nmalleability coupled with its usability makes it a robust and effective tool for siphoning data,\nmoving laterally, and loading additional malware payloads.\n\nCobalt Strike is not the only red team tool appearing more often in Proofpoint data. Others\ninclude Mythic, Meterpreter, and the Veil Framework.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of publicly available tooling aligns with a broader trend observed by Proofpoint:\nThreat actors are using as many legitimate tools as possible, including executing Windows\nprocesses like PowerShell and WMI; injecting malicious code into legitimate binaries; and\nfrequently using allowable services like Dropbox, Google Drive, SendGrid, and Constant\nContact to host and distribute malware.\n\n**References**\n\nThe following references are associated with the above timeline.\n\n[January 2016 – Odinaff: New Trojan used in high level financial attacks](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=257dd693-5986-41bf-bc33-f9dc76d9c6a8&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n\nMay 2017 – Microsoft Word Intruder Integrates CVE-2017-0199, Utilized by Cobalt Group to\nTarget Financial Institutions\n\nOctober 2017 – [Leviathan: Espionage actor spearphishes maritime and defense targets](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leviathan-espionage-actor-spearphishes-maritime-and-defense-targets)\n\n[April 2018 – APT攻撃者グループ menuPass(APT10) による新たな攻撃を確認](https://www.lac.co.jp/lacwatch/people/20180521_001638.html)\n\nNovember 2018 – Not So Cozy: An Uncomfortable Examination of a Suspected APT29\nPhishing Campaign\n\n2019 – Seven International Cyber Defendants, Including “Apt41” Actors, Charged In\nConnection With Computer Intrusion Campaigns Against More Than 100 Victims Globally\n\nNovember 2019 – TA2101 plays government imposter to distribute malware to German,\nItalian, and US organizations\n\n[September 2020 – Chinese Ministry of State Security-Affiliated Cyber Threat Actor Activity](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-258a)\n\nDecember 2020 – Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to\nCompromise Multiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor\n\n[March 2021 – NimzaLoader: TA800’s New Initial Access Malware](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/blog/threat-insight/nimzaloader-ta800s-new-initial-access-malware)\n\nMay 2021 – [New sophisticated email-based attack from NOBELIUM](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\n\n**Detections**\n\nProofpoint Emerging Threats includes robust detections for Cobalt Strike.
