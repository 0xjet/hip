    "plain_text": "# Notorious cybercrime gang’s botnet disrupted\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/04/13/zloader-botnet-disrupted-malware-ukraine/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/04/13/zloader-botnet-disrupted-malware-ukraine/)**\n\nApril 13, 2022\n\nToday, we’re announcing that Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has taken legal and\ntechnical action to disrupt a criminal botnet called ZLoader. ZLoader is made up of\ncomputing devices in businesses, hospitals, schools, and homes around the world and is run\nby a global internet-based organized crime gang operating malware as a service that is\ndesigned to steal and extort money.\n\nWe obtained a court order from the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia allowing us to take control of 65 domains that the ZLoader gang has been using to\ngrow, control and communicate with its botnet. The domains are now directed to a Microsoft\nsinkhole where they can no longer be used by the botnet’s criminal operators. Zloader\ncontains a domain generation algorithm (DGA) embedded within the malware that creates\nadditional domains as a fallback or backup communication channel for the botnet. In addition\nto the hardcoded domains, the court order allows us to take control of an additional 319\ncurrently registered DGA domains. We are also working to block the future registration of\nDGA domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring our investigation, we identified one of the perpetrators behind the creation of a\ncomponent used in the ZLoader botnet to distribute ransomware as Denis Malikov, who lives\nin the city of Simferopol on the Crimean Peninsula. We chose to name an individual in\nconnection with this case to make clear that cybercriminals will not be allowed to hide behind\nthe anonymity of the internet to commit their crimes. Today’s legal action is the result of\nmonths of investigation that pre-date the current conflict in the region.\n\nOriginally, the primary goal of Zloader was financial theft, stealing account login IDs,\npasswords and other information to take money from people’s accounts. Zloader also\nincluded a component that disabled popular security and antivirus software, thereby\npreventing victims from detecting the ZLoader infection. Over time those behind Zloader\nbegan offering malware as a service, a delivery platform to distribute ransomware including\nRyuk. Ryuk is well known for targeting health care institutions to extort payment without\nregard to the patients that they put at risk.\n\n[DCU led the investigative effort behind this action in partnership with ESET,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/13/eset-takes-part-global-operation-disrupt-zloader-botnets/) Black Lotus\n[Labs (the threat intelligence arm of Lumen), and](https://waggeneredstrom-my.sharepoint.com/personal/bgluckman_we-worldwide_com/Documents/Documents/DCU/ZLoader/https/www.lumen.com) [Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, with additional](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/)\ndata and insights to strengthen our legal case from our partners the Financial Services\n[Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (FS-ISAC) and the Health Information Sharing and](https://www.fsisac.com/)\n[Analysis Center (H-ISAC), in addition to our Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center](https://h-isac.org/)\n[and Microsoft Defender team. We also recognize the additional contribution from Avast in](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/04/13/dismantling-zloader-how-malicious-ads-led-to-disabled-security-tools-and-ransomware/)\nsupporting our DCU field in Europe.\n\nOur disruption is intended to disable ZLoader’s infrastructure and make it more difficult for\nthis organized criminal gang to continue their activities. We expect the defendants to make\nefforts to revive Zloader’s operations. We referred this case to law enforcement, are tracking\nthis activity closely and will continue to work with our partners to monitor the behavior of\nthese cybercriminals. We will work with internet service providers (ISPs) to identify and\nremediate victims. As always, we’re ready to take additional legal and technical action to\naddress Zloader and other botnets.\n\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [cybercrime,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybercrime-2/) [ransomware](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ransomware/)\n\n\n-----",
