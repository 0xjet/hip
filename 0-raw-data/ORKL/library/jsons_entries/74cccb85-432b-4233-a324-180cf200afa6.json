In at least one\ncase, however, victims were fooled into thinking the Android Stagefright vulnerability was\npreventing them from receiving an MMS and they needed to click on a bit.ly link to get it.\nThey would then enter a code based on a malicious SMS that gives cybercriminals control\nover an Android device. This meant cybercriminals were also able to more easily distribute\nmalware by accessing users’ contact lists.\n\nUnfortunately, remote administration tools have a history of being hijacked for nefarious\npurposes. Before OmniRAT, there was DroidJack, [SecurityWeek pointed out, which was also](https://www.securityweek.com/multi-platform-rat-omnirat-used-hijack-devices)\nco-opted by India-based cybercriminals to take over Android devices. The malicious use of\nDroidJack is still under investigation by European law enforcement authorities.\n\nWhat may make OmniRat even more attractive to cybercriminals is its price tag. For a mere\n$25, they have access to a tool that can be paired with fairly straightforward social\nengineering techniques to target mobile users. This compares with $210 for DroidJack on the\nblack market, [TechWorm reported. Besides stealing data, the tool could also be used to](http://www.techworm.net/2015/11/omnirat-25-tool-to-hack-into-windows-os-x-and-android-devices.html)\nprobe browser histories and record conversations, so the potential for damage, particularly\namong smartphone users conducting business remotely, is huge.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe misuse of software like OmniRAT has gotten so bad that they ve begun to be called\n[remote-access Trojans, according to Softpedia. On the other hand, it’s difficult if not](http://news.softpedia.com/news/omnirat-lets-hackers-control-android-phones-windows-mac-and-linux-pcs-495779.shtml)\nimpossible to outlaw remote administration tools entirely because they can also be put to\ngood use. For example, they can be used for testing or as a tool for staff developers.\n\nYou’re safe from something like OmniRAT if you ignore an [SMS that comes from attackers. If](https://securityintelligence.com/news/sms-sneak-attack-koler-android-ransomware-takes-smartphones-demands-payment/)\nyou’re a CISO or part of an IT security team, it would also help to educate or remind staff to\nmake sure they aren’t too quick to bypass permissions popups that could prevent\ncybercriminals from taking the next step and controlling their devices.\n\n[Android |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/android/) [Android Security |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/android-security/) [Android Vulnerability |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/android-vulnerability/) [Cybercrime |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/cyber-crime/) Data\nSecurity | [Malware |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/malware/) [Remote-Access Trojan (RAT) |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/remote-access-trojan/) [Social Engineering](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/social-engineering/)\n[Shane Schick](https://securityintelligence.com/author/shane-schick/)\nWriter & Editor\n\nShane Schick is a contributor for SecurityIntelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\n### more from\n\n\n-----\n\n[Intelligence & Analytics May 26, 2022](https://securityintelligence.com/category/topics/security-intelligence-analytics/)\n\n## Black Basta Besting Your Network?\n\nThis post was written with contributions from Chris Caridi and Kat Weinberger.
