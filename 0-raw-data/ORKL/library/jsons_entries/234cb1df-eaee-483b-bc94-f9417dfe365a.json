An earlier**\n_version inaccurately described the links to the Elfin group as \"strong\"._\n\nThe U.S. government has indicted three Iranian nationals on charges related to cyber attacks\nagainst aerospace and satellite technology companies. Said Pourkarim Arabi, Mohammad\nReza Espargham, and Mohammad Bayati are alleged to have carried out a string of attacks\nbetween 2015 and 2019 which resulted in the theft of sensitive commercial information,\nintellectual property, and personal data from targeted organizations.\n\n[According to the indictment, Arabi is a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1317521/download)\n(IRGC) and carried out the attacks with Espargham and Bayati on behalf of the IRGC.\nEspargham is alleged to be the leader of an Iranian hacking group known as the Iranian Dark\nCoders Team, while Bayati is alleged to be a malware developer who shared tools with Arabi\nand Espargham.\n\nThe men are said to have obtained the names of individuals working in the aerospace and\nsatellite industry, created fake accounts in their names, and used them to send spearphishing emails to targeted organizations. If victims clicked on a malicious link within the\nemail, malware would be installed on their computers. Once on the victim’s network, the\nattackers would escalate privileges, steal credentials, move laterally across the network, and\ndeploy further malware on computers before exfiltrating data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Possible Elfin link?\n\nAlthough not referenced specifically in the indictment, the attacks appear to have some links\nto the Elfin (aka APT33) cyber espionage group. Aside from the fact that the targets and\ntactics described in the indictment closely resemble Elfin activity observed by Symantec,\nthere is also a commonality in tools used. According to the indictment, one of the main\nmalware tools used in the attacks was the Nanocore RAT (Trojan.Nancrat). Although it was\npublicly available, Symantec has observed Elfin make extensive use of Nanocore. While we\nhaven’t observed any other Iranian group utilizing this tool, other vendors have found cases.\n\n## Who are Elfin?\n\n[Symantec has been tracking Elfin since late 2015. Aside from compromising its victims with](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)\nspear-phishing emails, the group is also known for scanning for vulnerable websites, either\nfor potential victims or for use as command and control (C&C) infrastructure. To date it has\ncompromised a wide range of targets, including governments along with organizations in the\nresearch, chemical, engineering, manufacturing, consulting, finance, telecoms, and several\nother sectors. Aside from the U.S, Elfin is also heavily focused on targets in Saudi Arabia,\nwhich accounted for 42 percent of attacks observed by Symantec between the start of 2016\nand March 2019. During this time, Symantec also identified possible links to the destructive\nShamoon group.\n\n## Recent attacks\n\nSymantec has observed multiple Elfin campaigns over the past 18 months. In February\n2019, the group attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in WinRAR in\norder to compromise an organization in the chemical sector in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn June 2019, Elfin sent out a phishing email to hundreds of recipients across multiple\ncountries in what appeared to be an opportunistic trawling attack. The link within the\ndocument led recipients to dynamic DNS infrastructure controlled by the group.\n\nSubsequently, in late August 2019, Elfin compromised a victim in Saudi Arabia with a\nmalicious HTA file. Following the initial compromise, Elfin continued to rely on the group’s\nknown tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) to strengthen its foothold. During the incident,\nthe legitimate utility mshta.exe executed a malicious HTA file with a job application theme.\nThe file was downloaded after a victim used Microsoft Edge to visit a malicious website. A\nPowerShell command then downloaded a JPG file from a dynamic DNS host spoofing a U.S.\ndefense contractor.\n\n## Chafer alert and sanctions\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a separate announcement, the FBI has also issued a new cyber security advisory about\nan Iranian company called Rana Intelligence Computing Company, which it says is a front for\nthe Chafer (aka APT39) cyber espionage group, which is linked to the Iranian Ministry of\nIntelligence and Security (MOIS). The FBI said Rana had systematically targeted and\nmonitored Iranian citizens, dissidents, and journalists, along with government networks of\nIran’s neighboring countries, and foreign organizations in the travel, academic, and\ntelecommunications sectors.\n\nSimultaneously, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\n[imposed sanctions on Rana, Chafer, and a number of named individuals who work for MOIS.](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20200917)\n\nChafer has been active since at least July 2014 and its activities were first exposed by\nSymantec in December 2015, when it was found to be conducting targeted surveillance of\ndomestic and international targets.\n\nIn 2018 Symantec [observed it mounting a number of ambitious new attacks including the](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/chafer-latest-attacks-reveal-heightened-ambitions)\ncompromise of a major telecoms services provider in the Middle East.\n\n## Increased pressure\n\nState-sponsored espionage actors appear to be firmly in the sights of the U.S. Justice and\nTreasury Departments. These indictments and sanctions may generate an unwelcome\namount of publicity and disruption for groups that may have believed they were operating\nwith a degree of anonymity.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\nSymantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against Elfin attacks:\n\n**File-based protection**\n\nBackdoor.Notestuk\nTrojan.Stonedrill\nBackdoor.Remvio\nBackdoor.Breut\nTrojan.Quasar\nBackdoor.Patpoopy\nTrojan.Nancrat\nTrojan.Netweird.B\nExp.CVE-2018-20250\nSecurityRisk.LaZagne\nHacktool.Mimikatz\nSniffPass\n\n\n-----\n\nSymantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against Chafer attacks:\n\n**File-based protection**\n\nBackdoor.Remexi\nBackdoor.Remexi.B\nHacktool.Mimikatz\nPwdump\n\n**IPS: network-based protection**\n\nSystem Infected: Backdoor.Remexi Activity\n\n\n-----",
