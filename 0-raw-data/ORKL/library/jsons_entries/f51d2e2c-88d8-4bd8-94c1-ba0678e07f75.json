This amount was later changed to $6 million.\n\nIn a [statement by Travelex, the currency exchange company is stating that there is no](https://web.archive.org/web/20200108161750/https://www.travelex.com/)\nevidence that any data was stolen.\n\n\"Whilst the investigation is still ongoing, Travelex has confirmed that the software virus is\nransomware known as Sodinokibi, also commonly referred to as REvil. Travelex has\nproactively taken steps to contain the spread of the ransomware, which has been\nsuccessful. To date, the company can confirm that whilst there has been some data\n\n\n-----\n\nencryption, there is no evidence that structured personal customer data has been\nencrypted. Whist Travelex does not yet have a complete picture of all the data that has\nbeen encrypted, there is still no evidence to date that any data has been exfiltrated.\"\n\nThe Sodinokibi actors, though, paint a different picture.\n\nWhen told that Travelex was denying any data was stolen, they told BleepingComputer that\nthey were currently negotiating the ransom price with Travelex and that they would benefit\neven if a ransom is not paid.\n\n\"If this were true, they would not bargain with us now. On the other hand, we do not care.\nWe will still benefit if they do not pay. Just the damage to them will be more serious.\"\n\nWhen we were told this, it was not 100% clear how the ransomware operators would\nbenefit.\n\nThis became clear in a recent forum post to a Russian hacker and malware forum where\nthe public representative for the REvil/Sodinokibi Ransomware stated that if Travelex does\nnot pay the ransom, they will sell the stolen PII information of their customers to other\nattackers.\n\n**Sodinokibi post to a Russian hacker forum**\nThis post translated to English as:\n```\nThere are no seats. And not planned. Travelex recommend starting to raise funds for\npayment, or DOB + SSN + CC will be sold to anyone.\n\n```\nThe statement \"There are not seats.\" in Unknown's post means that REvil is not accepting\nany new affiliates at this time.\n\nThe user named 'Unknown' is the public-facing representative of\nthe Sodinokibi Ransomware and has made forum posts in the past when the ransomware\n[first launched and they began building a team of affiliates composed of veteran malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-builds-an-all-star-team-of-affiliates/)\ndistributors.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware operators have been threatening to release stolen data for some time, but\nnone carried out their threats until the Maze Ransomware group released the stolen data of\nAllied Universal.\n\nSince then, Unknown has also stated that Sodinokibi Ransomware will adopt the tactic of\n[releasing stolen data as leverage to get victims to pay.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-will-now-publish-victims-data-if-not-paid/)\n\n**Unknown's post about releasing stolen data**\nTo this date, Sodinokibi has not released any stolen data and it is not known for sure if they\nwill release Travelex's if the ransom is not paid.\n\nHowever, if the data is released, it will open up a whole new world of business problems for\nTravelex\n\nThe Sodinokibi actors are right, too. No matter what happens, Travelex will incur further\ndamage; either through the payment of a ransom, the public release of their data, or by the\ndata being sold to other threat actors.\n\nIf the data is released, the attack will need to be classified as a data breach, notifications\nand free monitoring services will need to be offered, GDPR fines would be likely as are the\nrisks of class action lawsuits.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Travelex with questions regarding this story, but has not\nheard back.\n\n## Transparency in ransomware attacks is necessary\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen an organization suffers a ransomware attack, they usually try to hide the attack or\ndownplay its impact to prevent customer concerns, damage to brand image, and a plunging\nstock price.\n\nThis commonly, though, backfires as the severity of the attacks ultimately leak and make\nthe company look worse than if they had been transparent about it in the first place.\n\nNow that many ransomware attackers are claiming to steal data before encrypting devices,\nit is more important than ever to be transparent about these attacks as they could now be\nclassified as data breaches.\n\nBy hiding this information, companies are more likely to be hit with government fines and\nlawsuits as customers' personal information is compromised.\n\n[Instead, companies should follow Norsk Hydro's lead and be fully transparent during a](https://news.microsoft.com/transform/hackers-hit-norsk-hydro-ransomware-company-responded-transparency/)\nransomware attack by providing timely updates, customer notifications, and public\ninformation.\n\nThis approach not only made Norsk Hydro customers feel better but also increased their\nbrand image.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Blackmail](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/blackmail/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Extortion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/extortion/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n[Sodinokibi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sodinokibi/)\n[Travelex](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/travelex/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
