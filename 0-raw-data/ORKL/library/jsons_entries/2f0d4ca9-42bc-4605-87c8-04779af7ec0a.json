The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\n[published an advisory to warn organizations about these attacks and teamed with the FBI on](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-110a)\n[a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) response strategy guide. KillNet, a group that the US](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2022/10/28/joint-cisa-fbi-ms-isac-guide-responding-ddos-attacks-and-ddos-guidance-federal-agencies)\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has called pro-Russia hacktivists, has\nbeen launching waves of attacks against western countries, targeting governments and\n[companies with focus on the healthcare sector. DHHS published an analyst note on KillNet’s](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/killnet-analyst-note.pdf)\nthreat to the health sector, mentioning that the group compromised a US healthcare\norganization that supports members of the US military.\n\nKillNet uses DDoS as its main protest tool. DDoS attacks are a relatively easy and low-cost\nmethod of disrupting online services and websites and can be a powerful way to draw\nattention, making them a popular choice among hacktivist groups. In addition, DDoS attacks\ncan be launched anonymously, which could make it difficult for authorities to track down\nperpetrators.\n\nIn this blog post, we provide an overview of the DDoS attack landscape against healthcare\napplications hosted in Azure over three months. We then list a couple of recent campaigns\nfrom KillNet, describe their attack patterns, and present how we mitigated and protected\ncustomers from these attacks. Finally, we outline best practices for organizations to protect\ntheir applications against DDoS attacks.\n\n## DDoS attacks against healthcare in Azure\n\nWe measured the number of attacks daily on healthcare organizations in Azure between\nNovember 18, 2022 and February 17, 2023. We observed an incline from 10-20 attacks in\nNovember to 40-60 attacks daily in February.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Number of daily DDoS attacks on healthcare applications in Azure_\nWe tracked attack statistics through the same time period and observed that DDoS attacks\non healthcare organizations didn’t demonstrate severely high throughput. There were several\nattacks hitting 5M packets per second (pps), but majority of attacks were below 2M pps.\nThese attacks, although not extremely high, could take down a website if not protected by a\nnetwork security service like Azure DDoS Network Protection (see guidance at the end).\n\n_Figure 2. Attack throughput (pps) on healthcare organizations_\nThe types of healthcare organizations attacked included pharma and life sciences with 31%\nof all attacks, hospitals with 26%, healthcare insurance with 16%, and health services and\ncare also with 16%.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3._ _Types of healthcare organizations targeted by DDoS attacks_\nWe also observed a combination of multi-vector layer 3, layer 4, and layer 7 DDoS attacks.\nAttacks are primarily targeting web applications, and intertwined TCP and UDP attack\nvectors. We observed layer 7 DDoS attacks consuming many TCP connections and keeping\nthem alive long enough trying to deplete memory state resources to render the application\nunavailable. This is a repeated pattern noticed in several cases for attacks attributed to\nKillNet. Another common attack pattern tries to establish many new TCP connections over\nshort intervals to hit CPU resources.\n\n[In contrast to overall DDoS attack trends for 2022, in which TCP was the most common](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/02/21/2022-in-review-ddos-attack-trends-and-insights/)\nattack vector, 53% of the attacks on healthcare were UDP floods, and TCP accounted for\n44%, reflecting a different mixture of attack patterns used by adversaries on healthcare.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Distribution of DDoS attack types targeting healthcare_\nOut of the UDP attack vectors, 38% are UDP spoof flood attacks, followed by 29% of DNS\n[amplification attacks. UDP reflected amplification attacks consumed 52% of all attacks. This](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/05/23/anatomy-of-ddos-amplification-attacks/)\n[is in line with other public reports on KillNet, where amplification and spoofed sources are](https://www.csirt.gov.it/contenuti/attacco-ddos-ai-danni-del-sito-istituzionale-dello-csirt-italia-del-30-maggio-2022-analisi-preliminare-bl01-220531-csirt-ita)\nused, among other attack vectors. Although majority of attacks are on web applications,\nadversaries used multi-vector UDP spoof and reflected amplification attacks alongside TCP\nattacks to saturate the network and impact the attacked application.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Distribution of UDP attacks on healthcare_\n\n## Attack campaigns\n\nIn this section, we outline a couple of attack campaigns launched by KillNet or its affiliated\nhacktivist groups targeting customers in Azure. These attacks had no impact on Azure\nservices and customers were protected by our Azure DDoS Network Protection service.\n\nThe first customer is a healthcare provider that was hit by a DDoS attack recently. The attack\nthroughput wasn’t very high, peaking at 1.3M pps. The organization protected its service with\nAzure DDoS Network Protection, and the attack was successfully mitigated. Such attack\nthroughput demonstrates why it’s crucial to protect applications against DDoS attacks.\nSimilar attacks may target an application with low enough volumes that evade infrastructurelevel DDoS protection, as they don’t impose a risk to Azure services or to other customers\nbut may still take down an application. With Azure DDoS Network Protection, we learn\nnormal baseline patterns specific to an application and detect traffic anomalies effectively.\n\nAttack vectors included TCP SYN, TCP ACK, and packet anomalies. The attack lasted less\nthan 12 hours, and the adversary likely launched it using DDoS scripting tools, spoofing large\nnumbers of source IP addresses.\n\nAnother attack targeted a multinational industrial company. The attack lasted several days\nand included layer 4 TCP SYN and ACK, as well as layer 7 HTTP request attacks on the\ncompany’s website. It was launched from a botnet comprising 22,000 attack sources. The\n\n\n-----\n\nattack volume was similarly not very high, hitting 250K pps, and each attack source sent a\nrelatively small amount of HTTP traffic to the attacked website. Majority of the traffic pattern\nappeared as if it was legitimate client traffic. However, the number of connections created\naimed to consume state and CPU resources.\n\nThe top three countries from which the adversary launched the botnet attack were the US,\nRussia, and Ukraine.\n\n_Figure 6. Global distribution of botnet used to launch the attack_\nThese attacks were successfully mitigated for customers enrolled in Azure DDoS Network\nProtection and Web Application Firewall services.\n\n## Mitigating DDoS attacks from KillNet and other adversaries\n\nKillNet and its affiliated adversaries utilize DDoS attacks as their most common tactic. By\nusing DDoS scripts and stressors, recruiting botnets, and utilizing spoofed attack sources,\nKillNet could easily disrupt the online presence of websites and apps. KillNet attempted to\nevade DDoS mitigation strategies by changing their attack vectors, such as utilizing different\nlayer 4 and layer 7 attack techniques and increasing the number of sources participating in\nthe attack campaign.\n\n[Azure DDoS Network Protection helps to protect apps and resources with a profile](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ddos-protection/)\nautomatically tuned to expected traffic volume. Customers can defend themselves against\neven the most sophisticated attacks with an Azure global network that provides dedicated\nmonitoring, logging, telemetry, and alerts.\n\nAzure DDoS Network Protection not only detects and mitigates DDoS attacks, but also\nminimizes the impact on legitimate traffic, such as in cases where botnets are harnessed to\ncarry out attacks. We employ various mitigations to minimize false positives, including\nutilizing authentication, foot printing, and connection and rate-limiting countermeasures. With\n\n\n-----\n\n[DDoS Rapid Response, DDoS Network Protection customers can leverage a hotline to a](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-rapid-response)\nDDoS service team that helps in attack mitigation, which is important when attack campaigns\nare highly coordinated. The combination of Azures DDoS Network Protection and Web\nApplication Firewall (WAF) provides protection for layer 3, 4, and 7 DDoS attacks.\n\n## Steps to protect against and respond to DDoS attacks\n\nTo defend against DDoS attacks, organizations hosting web applications in Azure are\nrecommended to take the following steps:\n\n1. Enable DDoS Network Protection. [Enabling DDoS Network Protection takes only a](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/manage-ddos-protection)\n\nfew steps, and customers don’t need to change their network architecture. Include\n[Azure WAF to protect your application against layer 7 DDoS attacks and other](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/web-application-firewall/)\n[application attacks. Use Azure Front Door CDN to minimize the threat of DDoS attacks](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/frontdoor/)\nby distributing and balancing web traffic across Azure’s global network.\n2. Design your application with DDoS best practices in mind, and ensure it’s\n\n**protected before an attack occurs. Design your DDoS Protection strategy based on**\n[fundamental best practices. Make sure you test your application readiness, and DDoS](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ddos-protection/fundamental-best-practices)\n[Protection by simulating DDoS attacks with one of our partners.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ddos-protection/test-through-simulations)\n3. Create a DDoS response plan. Having a response plan is critical to help you identify,\n\nmitigate, and quickly recover from DDoS attacks. A key part of the strategy is a DDoS\nresponse team with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. This DDoS response\nteam should understand how to identify, mitigate, and monitor an attack and be able to\ncoordinate with internal stakeholders and customers.\n4. Reach out for help during an attack. During attacks you need to count on experts\n\nthat will help you to mitigate the attack while ensuring no downtime and keeping the\napplication up and running. Azure DDoS Network Protection customers have access to\nthe [DDoS Rapid Response team, who can help with investigation during an attack as](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-rapid-response)\nwell as post-attack analysis.\n5. Learn and adapt after an attack. While you’ll likely want to move on as quickly as\n\npossible if you’ve experienced an attack, it’s important to continue to monitor your\nresources and conduct a retrospective after an attack. You should apply any learnings\nto improve your DDoS response strategy.\n\n**_Amir Dahan and Syed Pasha, Azure Network Security Team_**\n\n\n-----",
