In this most recent activity, the group likely used compromised GlassFish_\n_servers and Cobalt Strike in initial access operations before switching to the_\n_bespoke Winnti, ShadowPad, and Spyder backdoors for long-term access_\n_using dedicated actor-provisioned command and control infrastructure._\n\n**Background**\n\nIn September 2020, Recorded Future clients received a report on activity linked\nto a user of the shared custom backdoors Winnti and ShadowPad. This activity\ntargeted a Hong Kong university and airport. The infrastructure and malware\n[used in these intrusions directly overlap with previous reporting by ESET and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/01/31/winnti-group-targeting-universities-hong-kong/)\n[NTT Group on Winnti Group activity. There are also numerous infrastructure](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf)\n[and malware overlaps with activity recently reported by Avast, which described](https://decoded.avast.io/luigicamastra/backdoored-client-from-mongolian-ca-monpass/)\n\n\n-----\n\nan installer backdoored with Cobalt Strike found on the official website of\nMonPass, a major certification authority (CA) in Mongolia. Both the\nShadowPad and Winnti backdoors are shared across multiple Chinese activity\ngroups. Winnti in particular has been historically used by both APT41/Barium\n[and APT17 and is commonly](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer) [associated with activity linked to multiple groups](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/apt17-is-run-by-the-jinan-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\nof loosely connected private contractors operating on behalf of China’s Ministry\nof State Security (MSS). In this case, Insikt Group tracks the cluster of activity\ndescribed in this and our previous report using the temporary name Threat\nActivity Group 22 (TAG-22), while we note some historical overlap with activity\nclustered as APT41 and Barium by FireEye and Microsoft, respectively.\n\n**Victimology and Use of Compromised GlassFish Infrastructure**\n\nInsikt Group tracks known infrastructure and domains linked to TAG-22 using a\ncombination of passive DNS data and adversary C2 detection techniques for\nShadowPad, Winnti, and the Spyder Backdoor. In June 2021, we identified\nTAG-22 intrusions targeting the following organizations in Taiwan, Nepal, and\nthe Philippines using Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) data:\n\nThe Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan\nNepal Telecom\nDepartment of Information and Communications Technology (The\nPhilippines)\n\nIn particular, the targeting of the ITRI is notable due to its role as a technology\nresearch and development institution that has set up and incubated multiple\nTaiwanese technology firms. According to the ITRI’s [website, the organization](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/ListStyle.aspx?DisplayStyle=20&SiteID=1&MmmID=617731521661672477)\nis particularly focused on research and development projects related to smart\nliving, quality health, sustainable environment, and technology, many of which\nmap to development priorities under China’s 14th 5-year plan, previously\nhighlighted by Insikt Group as likely areas of future Chinese economic\n[espionage efforts. In recent years, Chinese groups have targeted multiple](https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-hackers-taiwan-semiconductor-industry-skeleton-key/)\norganizations across Taiwan’s semiconductor industry to obtain source code,\nsoftware development kits, and chip designs.\n\nWhile we believe these 4 organizations were likely the intended end targets of\nTAG-22 intrusion activity, we also identified several suspected compromised\nGlassFish Servers communicating with TAG-22 C2 infrastructure. This is in line\nwith recent NTT [reporting, which identified the group exploiting GlassFish](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/the-operations-of-winnti-group.pdf)\nServer software version 3.1.2 and below and using the compromised\ninfrastructure to conduct onward intrusion activity, specifically scanning using\nthe Acunetix scanner and deploying the Cobalt Strike offensive security tool\n(OST). Per NTT researchers, the group likely used this infrastructure in the\n\n\n-----\n\nearly stages of intrusions before transitioning to dedicated infrastructure for\ncontrolling ShadowPad, Spyder, and Winnti implants. For its dedicated\ninfrastructure, TAG-22 primarily used domains registered via Namecheap and\nChoopa (Vultr) virtual private servers (VPS) for hosting.\n\n**Nepal Telecom Tradecraft Case Study**\n\nBy querying the TAG-22 C2 domain vt.livehost[.]live in the Recorded Future\nThreat Intelligence Platform, we identified links to the Shadowpad and Spyder\nbackdoors that combine Recorded Future C2 detections and passive DNS\ndata.\n\n**_Figure 1: Malicious Infrastructure Verdict for vt.livehost[.]com (Source:_**\n_Recorded Future)_\n\nThis allows us to pivot and identify the TAG-22 IP address 139.180.141[.]227,\nwhich we have detected being used by the group for both Shadowpad and\nSpyder command and control.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Intelligence Card for TAG-22 C2 139.180.141[.]227 (Source:_**\n_Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3: Sample exfiltration event from Nepal Telecom to TAG-22 C2_**\n_Infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nIn addition to identifying additional related malicious infrastructure, using\nNetwork Traffic Analysis Exfiltration Events, we were also able to pinpoint\nspecific victims of TAG-22 activity. The screenshot above shows an exfiltration\nevent from the Nepal Telecom IP to the Shadowpad and Spyder backdoor C2\n139.180.141[.]227, which hosted the domain vt.livehost[.]live at the time of\nexfiltration. While the victim IP address is assigned to Nepal Telecom, for\ntelecommunication companies, this is often insufficient for attributing the true\nvictim organization because the majority of infrastructure owned by those\nentities is leased or provided to its customers. In this case, we can use the\nnew, proprietary VPN and Geographical Information extension alongside other\nenrichments to try to pinpoint the victim of this activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: VPN and Geographical Information extension for Nepal Telecom IP_**\n_202.70.66[.]146 (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nBy clicking on the Google Maps view within the VPN and Geographical\nInformation extension for this IP address, we can pinpoint a location and\nconfirm that Nepal Telecom is likely the victim of this activity — the location\ndirectly points to Nepal Telecom’s head office in Kathmandu.\n\n**_Figure 5: VPN and Geographical Information extension for Nepal Telecom IP_**\n_202.70.66[.]146 (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n**Malware Analysis**\n\nThrough analyzing the identified TAG-22 operational infrastructure, we\nidentified several Cobalt Strike samples likely used by the group to gain an\ninitial foothold in the target environment. The group also used a custom Cobalt\n\n\n-----\n\nStrike loader the malware authors appear to have called Fishmaster based on\na debugging string present within several samples:\n\n(C:\\Users\\test\\Desktop\\fishmaster\\x64\\Release\\fishmaster.pdb)\n\nThe string “fish_master” was also present across others.\n\nFor initial access, the group typically used double extensions for Fishmaster\nPortable Executable (PE) files to make them appear like Microsoft Office or\nPDF files:\n\n2af96606c285542cb970d50d4740233d2cddf3e0fe165d1989afa29636ea11db\n\n   - Advertising Cooperation- DUKOU ICU.pdf.exe\nC2df9f77b7c823543a0528a28de3ca7acb2b1d587789abfe40f799282c279f7d\n\n  - 履歷-王宣韓.docx.exe\n\nIn each case, following execution, the user is shown a decoy document, such\nas the resume shown below for a likely Taiwanese national. In other instances,\nthe group used malicious macros to drop the Fishmaster loader. As both\nsample lure documents are written in traditional Chinese characters and the CV\nfeatures a Taiwanese university, and because the group has more widely\ntargeted Taiwan, we believe that Taiwanese organizations were likely the\ntargets for these particular lures.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6: Decoy documents used in TAG-22 activity_**\n\nMany of the Cobalt Strike beacon payloads used by TAG-22 across this\n[campaign were configured using the Backoff malleable C2 profile, which](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/crimeware/backoff.profile)\ncontains the following high level network traffic characteristics:\n\n\n-----\n\nUser Agent: “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/24.0\"\nHTTP POST URI (multiple choices):\n\n/windebug/updcheck.php\n\n/aircanada/dark.php\n\n/aero2/fly.php\n\n/windowsxp/updcheck.php\n\n/hello/flash.php\n\nHTTP GET URI:\n\n/updates\n\nAll of the configurations contain the watermark 305419896, which is associated\nwith a cracked version of Cobalt Strike.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nAt this time, Insikt Group continues to track TAG-22 activity as an independent\nactivity cluster that overlaps with the wider group defined as Winnti Group by\nESET. TAG-22 uses shared custom backdoors likely unique to Chinese statesponsored groups, including ShadowPad and Winnti, while also employing\nopen-source or offensive security tools such as Cobalt Strike and Acunetix.\nTAG-22’s continued use of publicly reported infrastructure is indicative of a\ngroup experiencing a high degree of operational success despite a breadth of\npublic reporting regarding its operations. Insikt Group has primarily identified\nTAG-22 operating within Asia. However, apart from this campaign, the group\nhas a relatively broad targeting scope both geographically and by industry. This\nwider targeting scope, coupled with the use of the Winnti backdoor, is typical of\n[several suspected MSS contractors, including APT17 and APT41.](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/apt17-is-run-by-the-jinan-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\n\n**For a full list of indicators of compromise, please refer to** **Insikt Group’s**\n**Github repository.**\n\n\n-----",
