At the time of the attack, the UK quickly\nprovided advice and recommended actions to those affected and Microsoft said that by end\nof March that 92% of customers had patched against the vulnerability.\n\nToday the UK is also attributing the Chinese Ministry of State Security as being behind\nactivity known by cyber security experts as “APT40” and “APT31”.\n\nWidespread, credible evidence demonstrates that sustained, irresponsible cyber activity\nemanating from China continues.\n\nThe Chinese government has ignored repeated calls to end its reckless campaign, instead\nallowing its state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks and act recklessly when\ncaught.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis coordinated action today sees the international community once again urge the Chinese\ngovernment to take responsibility for its actions and respect the democratic institutions,\npersonal data and commercial interests of those with whom it seeks to partner.\n\nThe UK is calling on China to reaffirm the commitment made to the UK in 2015 and as part of\nthe G20 not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property of trade\nsecrets.\n\n**Notes to editors**\n\nAs part of a cross-Government response, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)\nissued tailored advice to over 70 affected organisations to enable them successfully to\nmitigate the effects of the compromise.\nIn 2018, the UK government and its allies revealed that elements of the Chinese\nMinistry of State Security (MSS) were responsible for one of the most significant and\n[widespread cyber intrusions stealing trade secrets. [link]](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-allies-reveal-global-scale-of-chinese-cyber-campaign)\n[The European Union has also made an announcement today [link].](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/07/19/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-urging-china-to-take-action-against-malicious-cyber-activities-undertaken-from-its-territory/)\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre has assessed that:\n\n**Actors** **Activity** **NCSC Assessment**\n\n\nHAFNIUM Compromising Microsoft\nExchange gave the\nperpetrator a foothold to\npivot further into the IT\nnetworks of victims.\n\n\nAPT40,\nTEMP.Periscope,\nTEMP.Jumper.\nLeviathan\n\n\nTargeting maritime\nindustries and naval\ndefence contractors in the\nUS and Europe. Targeting\nregional opponents of the\nBelt and Road Initiative.\nTargeting multiple\nCambodian electoral\nentities in the run up to\nthe 2018 election.\n\n\nNCSC is almost certain that the Microsoft\nExchange compromise was initiated and\nexploited by a Chinese state-backed\nthreat actor. NCSC judge it highly likely\nthat HAFNIUM is associated with the\nChinese state. The attack was highly likely\nto enable large-scale espionage, including\nacquiring personally identifiable\ninformation and intellectual property.\n\nNCSC judge it is highly likely that APT40\nis linked to the Chinese Ministry of State\nSecurity and operates to key Chinese\nState Intelligence requirements. NCSC\njudge that APT40 is highly likely\nsponsored by the regional MSS security\noffice, the MSS Hainan State Security\nDepartment (HSSD).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Actors** **Activity** **NCSC Assessment**\n\n\nAPT31,\nJudgement\nPanda,\nZirconium, Red\nKeres\n\nMedia enquiries\n\n\nSince 2020 targeting\ngovernment entities,\npolitical figures,\ncontractors and service\nproviders.
