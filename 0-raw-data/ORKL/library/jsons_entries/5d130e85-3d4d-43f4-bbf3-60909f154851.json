Based on info provided by the cloud\nstorage platform, the stolen CNA data was not shared outside the attackers' Mega account.\n\n\n-----\n\nTaking into account the results of the ransomware attack investigation, CNA says that there\nis no evidence that the threat actor viewed, retained or shared the exported data and, thus,\nno risk of harm to individuals arising from the incident.\"\n\n[Despite this conclusion, CNA still decided to notify impacted individuals earlier this month of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/insurance-giant-cna-reports-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/)\na potential data breach after the March Phoenix CryptoLocker ransomware attack.\n\nAccording to breach information filed by CNA with the office of Maine's Attorney General,\nthis data breach affected 75,349 individuals.\n\n## Potential links to sanctioned cybercrime group\n\nBased on source code similarities, Phoenix Locker is believed to be a new ransomware\n[strain developed by the Evil Corp hacking group to avoid anctions after victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/evil-corp/)\nof [WastedLocker ransomware no longer paid ransoms to avoid fines or legal action.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-wastedlocker-ransomware-distributed-via-fake-program-updates/)\n\nWhen asked by BleepingComputer about a possible connection between the sanctioned\nEvil Corp and Phoenix Locker, CNA said there was no confirmed link.\n\n\"The threat actor group, Phoenix, responsible for this attack, is not a sanctioned entity and\nno US government agency has confirmed a relationship between the group that attacked\nCNA and any sanctioned entity,\" the company said.\n\nCNA is considered the seventh-largest commercial insurance company in the US, per stats\nfrom the [Insurance Information Institute.](https://www.iii.org/publications/commercial-insurance/rankings)\n\nThe insurer provides an extensive array of insurance products, including cyber insurance\npolicies, to individuals and businesses across the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[CNA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cna/)\n[Insurance](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/insurance/)\n[Phoenix Cryptolocker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phoenix-cryptolocker/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
