Anatomy of a Publicly- Available Ransomware Builder\n\n**[sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-slam-anatomy-of-a-publicly-available-ransomware-builder/](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-slam-anatomy-of-a-publicly-available-ransomware-builder/)**\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe barrier to entry for enterprising cybercriminals has been dropping considerably over\n[recent years, in part due to the availability of RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) offerings on](https://www.sentinelone.com/?s=raas)\nthe [darknet but also due to publicly-accessible code being shared for free. One such offering](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/20-years-in-the-dark-the-dark-web-turns-twenty-what-does-this-mean-for-a-ciso/)\nis the Slam Ransomware Builder, which had been hosted until recently on Github. In this\npost, we highlight how free ransomware builders like Slam offer an easy route into\ncybercrime and yet present a credible threat to organizations and enterprises. We provide a\ndetailed list of indicators to help security teams detect and protect against Slam ransomware\npayloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Ransomware For “Educational Purposes Only”?\n\nThe Slam Ransomware Builder first appeared in late 2021, with Slam ransomware payloads\n[appearing in the wild shortly after (e.g., ConsoleApp2.exe). During mid-2022, downloadable](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5e22cb7f18eebc2cda1b33616096afc2d51ac79bad00d53b676a74f955181a8d/detection)\nand executable versions of the Slam Ransomware Builder appeared on a publicly-visible\nrepository on Github and were available for several months until Github admins removed the\nrepository on September 1st, 2022.\n\nThe owner of the now-removed repository dubbed it “The Most Advanced Free Ransomware\nBuilder” and has a history of providing “educational” videos on Vimeo, Youtube and KZHome,\ninstructing viewers how to build ransomware and “virus payloads”.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: Slam ransomware builder video hosted on Vimeo\nWhile the author’s public postings contain the usual “for educational purposes only” and\n“don’t try this” disclaimers to avoid responsibility, they also contain language such as “most\nadvanced ransomware” and “damage rate: destructive”.\n\nSource: Slam ransomware builder video hosted on Youtube\nThe author had described the ransomware’s behavior in detail in earlier publicly-posted\nvideos, describing how victim data could be exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled site.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe author’s reasons for distributing free ransomware builders can only be guessed at, but\ndespite being free, the builder and payloads are genuine threats that can cause real\ndamage. As our analysis below shows, Slam is a full-featured ransomware with AES256\nencryption, UAC bypass, shadow backup copy deletion and data exfiltration capabilities. In\nother words, everything needed to lock and steal enterprise data.\n\n## Slam Ransomware Builder Features\n\nThe most recent release of the Slam ransomware builder prior to being removed from Github\nwas version 1.7. Earlier versions of the tool supported either English or Spanish locales,\nwhile later versions including 1.7 allow toggling between the two.\n\nThe existing feature set includes the following:\n\nFully customizable ransom notes\nCustom encryption passphrases\nAll ransomware to lay dormant until a network is available\nUAC Bypass (1)\nRun external commands with the ransomware launch\nVSS/ backup deletion\nBasic file transfers (HTTP) for exfiltration\n\nDespite the code being removed from Github, it is possible the author intends to find or\nalready has other distribution outlets. A list of features promised for the future include screen\nlocking, MBR overwrites, and “LogonUI overwriting”.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon running the code provided on Github, users of the builder are presented with a menu\nleading to different builder components or indications of their upcoming release.\n\nVersion 1.6 of the Slam Ransomware Builder\nWhen choosing the “slam ransomware builder” option, users must first “Install”, then “Start”\nto launch the builder interface. This installation essentially consists of writing the builder EXE\nto `c:\\slam_ransomware_builder\\ . Any other component requiring an “Install” step will`\nalso go to the root of the C drive (e.g., `c:\\slam_mbr_builder)`\n\nOnce the main interface is launched, the user is presented with a standard set of options for\nbuilding their ransomware payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nOptions including the following are present in this interface:\n\nRansom note name and text\nWallpaper modification options and images\nAffected file extensions\nFile encryption (types / extensions to encrypt)\nRemote folder options (OneDrive)\n\nThe tool provides more ‘Advanced’ configuration options as well. These options are\naccessible via the “advanced” button.\n\n\n-----\n\nOptions in this section include:\n\nNetwork awareness (remain idle until Wi-Fi is available)\nVerbose output options (decrypter)\nPersistence (add to startup)\nInhibit recovery (website blocking, self-destruction, backup destruction).\n\nThe “block antivirus websites” option is meant to inhibit the victims from being able to\ndownload security software or check suspicious files on public malware repository sites such\nas VirusTotal.\n\nThe ransomware achieves this by modifying the device’s Hosts file, adding a long list of sites\nbelonging to the likes of Avast, Avira, Bitdefender, CCleaner, Google, Kaspersky, McAfee,\nMicrosoft, Panda Security, Trend Micro, VirusTotal, YouTube, and others. Each site is simply\nbound to the machine’s loopback address (typically, `127.0.0.1 ), preventing the domain`\nname from being resolved to an external IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the almost 100 domain names added to the Hosts file\nWith regard to bypasses, the version of Slam we analyzed includes a single UAC bypass,\nbased on UACMe, which attempts to defeat Windows User Account Control by abusing the\nbuilt-in Windows AutoElevate backdoor. UACMe is a bypass technique that has been known\nfor some years and widely abused by a number of other malware families including Multiplug\n[adware, Dyre, Empercrypt and IcedID.](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/icedid-botnet-the-iceman-goes-phishing-for-us-tax-returns/)\n\nTo exfiltrate victim data, the user can specify an HTTP server in the configuration interface,\nwhere a connection test can also be performed. If the connection test fails, an error is\ndisplayed. Other options available to the user include USB infection and execution of custom\ncommands when the payload is detonated on the victim machine.\n\n## Slam Ransomware Payloads\n\nWith all options configured, the executable payloads generated are standard EXE files. The\nbuilder outputs both the encryptor and decryptor tools.\n\nWhen executed with non-Administrator privileges, the UAC prompts and/or configured\nbypasses will come into play.\n\n\n-----\n\nSlam payload UAC\n\nprompt\nPost-execution, the victim device is encrypted according to the options configured in the\nbuilder.\n\nThe payload is written to `%AppData%\\Local\\discord.exe, which is called in the registry`\n(Run key), ensuring the ransomware payload is persistent.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs advertised, the Slam payload successfully inhibits recovery via removal of VSS backups\non an unprotected machine. Both `wmic and` `vssadmin methods are utilized for VSS`\ndeletion.\n```\n/c vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete & bcdedit /set\n{default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled\nno & wbadmin delete catalog -quiet\n\nwmic shadowcopy delete\n\n\n```\nThe ransomware also deletes various logs, Windows installation and recovery-related files\nvia `cleanmgr.exe . In the payload we analyzed, for example, a process named`\n```\nwgMHhFHnkiczPUNfqaA8Cx4kqwVcRG.exe issues the cleanmgr.exe command with the\n/AUTOCLEAN parameter, which executes Windows disk cleanup and removes Windows\n\n```\ninstallation files on unprotected devices.\n```\n\\system32\\cleanmgr.exe /autoclean /d C:\n\n\n## Slam MBR Builder\n\n```\nThe Slam builder also contains a very early stage “Alpha” MBR builder tool. Choosing to\n“Install” should write `start.exe to` `c:\\slam_mbr_builder\\start.exe . This does not`\nappear to occur in our testing and analysis, and the feature appears to be non-functional in\nthe version of the Slam Builder we analyzed from Github.\n\nHowever, we were able to obtain a copy of the builder from another source that allowed us to\nlaunch the builder and observe the output.\n\n\n-----\n\nSlam “Alpha” MBR builder\nWithin the MBR Builder interface, users are able to configure the message displayed to the\nvictim.\n\nSlam MBR Builder Ransom Note Configuration\n\nPrior to executing the build, a final screen allows the attacker to choose the “reboot mode”\nwith the options being\n\n\n-----\n\nDo Nothing\nBSOD\nReboot\nShutdown\nNothing\n\nPayloads from the MBR builder have been observed in the wild with the following PDB string.\n```\nC:\\slam_mbr_builder\\MbrOverwriter\\mbrcs\\obj\\Debug\\mbrcs.pdb\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n```\nIn this area and many others of infosec, there is a fine line between “education” and\nresearcher-led offensive security that seeks to explore and improve weaknesses in\nenterprise defenses on the one hand, and simple, out-and-out malicious code designed to\naid and abet criminal offenses on the other. We see no indications in the various public\nartifacts around the Slam ransomware builder (code, videos, Github repository) that suggest\nit could reasonably be interpreted as in the service of the former.\n\nHowever that may be, once in the hands of unscrupulous actors, full-featured projects such\nas these represent a real risk to enterprises and organizations.\n\nWe applaud Github for removing this code and hope this post serves as a reminder to\ndefenders to be vigilant as threat actors continue to simplify the ransomware-centric extortion\nprocess. The barrier to entry into the world of cybercrime has never been lower.\n\n[SentinelOne Singularity™ detects and prevents malicious behavior associated with Slam](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/)\nRansomware and its associated artifacts.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nI6LYb3yCi4\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Observed File Names**\n\nConsoleApp2.exe\n\nmbrcs.exe\n\nJpegMedic ARWE\n\nslam ransomware builder.exe\n\n**Observed PDB Strings**\n```\nC:\\slam_mbr_builder\\MbrOverwriter\\mbrcs\\obj\\Debug\\mbrcs.pdb\n\nc:\\slam_ransomware_builder\\ConsoleApp2\\ConsoleApp2\\obj\\Debug\\ConsoleApp2.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\amdga\\Desktop\\UACME-master\\Source\\Akagi\\output\\Win32\\Debug\\Akagi.pdb\n\nD:\\agent\\_work\\20\\s\\\\binaries\\x86ret\\bin\\i386\\\\vcruntime140d.i386.pdb\n\nc:\\slam_ransomware_builder\\uac\\ConsoleApp2\\obj\\Debug\\ConsoleApp2.pdb\n\nc:\\slam_ransomware_builder\\ConsoleApp2\\ConsoleApp2\\obj\\Debug\\ConsoleApp2.pdb\n\nC:\\slam_mbr_builder\\MbrOverwriter\\mbrcs\\obj\\Debug\\mbrcs.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\amdga\\source\\repos\\conect\\conect\\obj\\Debug\\conect.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\ander\\source\\repos\\slam ransomware builder\\slam ransomware\nbuilder\\obj\\Debug\\slam ransomware builder.pdb\n\n\n```\n**SHA1 Hashes**\n\n1ba9043ac164c6c60de4a1ee2ca50b2e7f4ebaf5\n\n2037d9f2e7cd15930e83f5142c5a48adecd3b617\n\n272566e8b5880e32cefb7a165a833652815a003f\n\n27b1ca0793caa19edabfbc49e6cffc05b73093da\n\n\n-----\n\n2c41f64557056e69541acf5ba52313869122f625\n336371f4200af680f73c0b9c51fca5a25dd5754a\n\n35ab1d4924990bf98a8e2e1026f91b5c9052de8e\n\n3fa6705ca1b056a66f25a689dff72af0893f5b86\n\n40bfa92e86484c09f2f7668121a1c4047c17ae72\n\n44aaef83b79f4e963c4fee56250bc053eae5ec64\n\n4879bd193dd73681c977371c857217257f141c92\n\n4cff2b02cb6c1f866499125c003af1032a81b480\n\n5a28f787cc73cffa7b5786faf3298d43e00d12aa\n\n61e8ba86725ec3f4e034c51950cabc6254c5cca5\n\n6325c42719b1aa3a48dd39b8add200054d3e0118\n\n669ce00937bde782a88526205f083861e6d71be1\n\n6e420a6c7b8e2d144df66dcbbae1afba62c82f4b\n\n7429fdf9151dfa9e4d4dc8ef86528313d13dc73f\n\n7690c273c8164a65602ed8f4284f0d50966d27c6\n\n863edff3c71e89349674df35ab07f27ecb6702ef\n\n880c343e75e7e8731f185ce756357599c37be065\n\n8b46ce2ffa24a377ff30ea094e02bc3ba3e808da\n\n8f3dc8437563182e06699763581fd6f7923b7582\n\n9edd3d920fbe89240d52cc8b300a90e5bf576f73\n\nb031d4c3747b58d930f33fe73abbf518dac63a31\n\nbe82474f54f49249c43c701c12907ec730e2a723\n\nc5351846988ef5d6e7b95f564416138f59e2092a\n\nc84aeb8c0b3939fd7f6beb9d73e72cc5ed8745db\n\nc998384c7b8cfd2ca881f282dfdbc104d8402bac\n\nca2999c9c5a17b0253579194f651b4aafdce16f1\n\ncb243b61a8d43816e1de7f0767b1377d0276dd71\n\ncf30cc1e653043df81aa9d8974f2f927ceadc826\n\nd187d81f4d021839e8f6e925dc192e231eb4679c\n\nd635103117daaf2a2b93d465e32e7b722dd4d367\n\nd6c9a556f5770f0a8f8ad05c5d46becd0cd021d3\n\nd94eb94bb3c2c6c0c70916f8be2417ac616e8b43\n\ndc327f3afbb6c770656be16fc885e1090f8395a3\n\nddba71aae3b8139210f71e835e1b89e90b0bd1dc\n\ne0868fdb2f09d3a4aefe4c79d6af88c2f9b55ce2\n\ne2052995d368355e899a518dbbbab716045abbd1\n\ne9a5b40d0ba5a8bb5c4a1c5471616c93e0851558\n\nea4f7dda5a64a740a9c5570870ccba2788c69ea6\n\nee144154139619b8c1d890e5b6f9bf130d929e6f\n\neeafbbfaaf05d8b7a8a1dc3f7858a21e7fdb0531\n\nf31855a1d5509b1e906caee75db3326515488cbc\n\nfcd90af249796fc3c40e1e94d558b6f2d61304b5\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\nT1542.003 – Pre-OS Boot: Bootkit\n\nT1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation\n\nT1547.001 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\nT1564.003 – Hide Artifacts: Hidden Window\n\nT1112 – Modify Registry\n\nT1490 – Inhibit System Recovery\n\nT1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nT1491.001 – Defacement: Internal Defacement\n\nT1083 – File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1005 – Data from Local System\n\nT0809 – Data Destruction\n\n\n-----",
