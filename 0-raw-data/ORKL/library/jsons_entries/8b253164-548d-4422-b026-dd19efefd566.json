The list of system folders that are\nskipped can be found below:\n```\nwindir\nSystemDrive\n:\\$Recycle.Bin\n:\\ProgramData\n:\\Users\\All Users\n:\\Program Files\n:\\Local Settings\n:\\Boot\n:\\System Volume Information\n:\\Recovery\n\\AppData\\\n\n```\nWhen encrypting a file it will append a ransom 5 character string to the files extension. For\nexample, a file named 1.doc will be encrypted and renamed like 1.docqkWbv.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Folder of Encrypted Files**\nIn each file that is encrypted, the SNAKE Ransomware will append the 'EKANS' file marker\nshown below. EKANS is SNAKE in reverse.\n\n\n-----\n\n**EKANS File Marker**\n\nBleepingComputer has tested many ransomware infections since 2013 and for some\nreason, it took Snake particularly long time to encrypt our small test box compared to many\nother ransomware infections. As this is targeted ransomware that is executed at the time of\nthe attacker's choosing, this may not be that much of a problem as the encryption will most\nlikely occur after hours.\n\nWhen done encrypting the computer, the ransomware will create a ransom note in\nthe C:\\Users\\Public\\Desktop folder named Fix-Your-Files.txt. This ransom note contains\ninstructions to contact a listed email address for payment instructions. This email address is\ncurrently bapcocrypt@ctemplar.com.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SNAKE Ransom Note**\nAs you can see from the language in the ransom note, this ransomware specifically targets\nthe entire network rather than individual workstations. They further indicate that any\ndecryptor that is purchased will be for the network and not individual machines, but it is too\nsoon to tell if they would make an exception.\n\nThis ransomware is still being analyzed for weaknesses and it is not known if it can be\ndecrypted for free. At this time, though, it looks secure.\n\n## IOCs:\n\n### Hash:\n```\ne5262db186c97bbe533f0a674b08ecdafa3798ea7bc17c705df526419c168b60\n\n Ransom note text:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n| What happened to your files? \n-------------------------------------------We breached your corporate network and encrypted the data on your computers. The\nencrypted data includes documents, databases, photos and more all were encrypted using a military grade encryption algorithms (AES-256 and RSA2048). You cannot access those files right now. But dont worry!\nYou can still get those files back and be up and running again in no time. \n--------------------------------------------| How to contact us to get your files back?\n--------------------------------------------The only way to restore your files is by purchasing a decryption tool loaded with a\nprivate key we created specifically for your network. \nOnce run on an effected computer, the tool will decrypt all encrypted files - and\nyou can resume day-to-day operations, preferably with\nbetter cyber security in mind.
