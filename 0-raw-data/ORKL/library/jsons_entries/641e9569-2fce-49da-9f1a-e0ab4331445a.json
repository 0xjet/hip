We take an indepth look at the ransomware group’s operations and discuss how organizations can bolster their defenses against it.\n\n\n-----\n\nView infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: Hive\"\n\nWhile some [ransomware groups operating as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) networks claim to steer clear of targeting specific sectors such](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware)\nas hospitals or other critical industries to avoid causing harm to people, Hive’s attacks against healthcare providers in 2021 showed that\n[the operators behind it have no regard for such humanitarian considerations. A hospital in Missouri suffered a Hive ransomware attack three](https://healthitsecurity.com/news/hive-ransomware-continues-to-attack-healthcare-providers#:~:text=Hive%20Ransomware%20Group%20Attacks%20Missouri,Louis%20Public%20Radio%20reported.)\n[weeks after the same group hit the integrated systems of a healthcare provider that affected three hospitals and many outpatient clinics in two](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-attacks-memorial-health-system-steals-patient-data/)\nother US states. Hive [ransomware has become one of the most active ransomware families since its discovery in June 2021. To defend](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-attacks-memorial-health-system-steals-patient-data/)\nagainst this threat, it is therefore crucial for companies to be acquainted with the various mechanisms that the infamous ransomware gang\nuses.\n\n## What do organizations need to know about Hive?\n\n[On August 15, 2021, Hive’s ransomware attacks against a non-profit integrated health system severely disrupted the clinical and financial](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-attacks-memorial-health-system-steals-patient-data/)\noperations of three hospitals in Ohio and West Virginia. The attack resulted in emergency room diversions and cancelation of urgent surgical\ncases and radiology examinations. The encryption of files forced the hospital staff to use paper charts. Aside from the three hospitals, the\naffected non-profit also runs several outpatient service sites and clinics with a combined workforce of 3,000 employees.\n\n[Hive operators used double extortion techniques in this attack. Aside from the encryption of data, they also stole patient information that they](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti)\nthreatened to publish on HiveLeaks, their dedicated leak site. The gang shares the list of victims that have not paid the ransom on their Tor\nsite.\n\n[The incident prompted the FBI to issue an alert in late August that detailed Hive ransomware’s indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics,](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21049431-fbi-flash-hive-ransomware-iocs)\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs). According to the alert, Hive operators use phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial\naccess to the system and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally once on the network.\n\nThe motivation of those in the cyber-underground to expand their foothold inevitably leads to the incursion of uncharted paths. In late October\n2021, threat researchers discovered that Hive has new malware tools specifically developed to encrypt Linux and FreeBSD systems. The\n[report notes that Hive is among other ransomware operators that have set their sights on Linux servers. Other notorious ransomware groups](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-now-encrypts-linux-and-freebsd-systems/)\nhave also been known to create their own Linux encryptors.\n\nAs enterprises slowly migrate to virtual machines to achieve better device management and optimize the use of resources, targeting virtual\nmachines also makes good business sense for RaaS operators because it enables them to encrypt multiple servers simultaneously with just\none command. Researchers pointed out that Hive’s bespoke tool for Linux is not fully functional yet as it still cannot completely encrypt all files\nwhen the malware was deployed in an explicit path. However, one can expect Hive to keep refining their Linux encryptors to diversify and\nfortify its malware tool kit.\n\n\n-----\n\nJa ua y 0, o e o u ope s a gest ca dea e s su e ed a e a so a e attac e S [ss co](https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-biggest-car-dealer-hit-with-ransomware-attack/) pa y s a e appea ed as o e o t e\nvictims on HiveLeaks in February. Targeting high-value enterprises has become a trend for ransomware operators as can be gleaned from the\nprofile of the victim that reportedly generated US$3.29 billion in revenues for 2020.\n\n## Overview of Hive’s operations\n\nHive operations are more prolific than their leak site might suggest. HiveLeaks only publishes the list of victims that have not settled the\n[ransom, so it is tough to determine which — or how many — companies decided to pay the ransom. A report indicates that attack attempts by](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-enters-big-league-with-hundreds-breached-in-four-months/)\nHive affiliates hit an average of three companies per day since the group was first discovered in June 2021. The report also mentioned that\nsecurity researchers who got access to information directly from the administrator panel of the Hive Tor site discovered that the number of\nenterprises whose systems had been compromised have reached 355 from September to December 2021.\n\n[Intelligence gathered by the researchers further revealed that the founders of the group deliberately put systems in place to achieve as much](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-enters-big-league-with-hundreds-breached-in-four-months/)\nease and transparency as possible particularly in the process of ransomware deployment and negotiations. Researchers also learned that the\ngeneration of malware versions by affiliates can be done within 15 minutes, while negotiations are coursed through the Hive ransomware\nadministrators who relay the message to the victims in a chat window that the affiliates can see.\n\nResearchers also shared that affiliates can see on the Hive administrator panel how much money was collected, the list of companies that\npaid, and those whose information was leaked.\n\nThe group’s emphasis on operational efficiency and transparency is key to enticing new affiliates. It suggests that the group is aiming for\nsustainability by creating an environment that is conducive to building a bigger and stronger affiliate base.\n\n[Of note is that some enterprises complained about the decryption tool that Hive operators provided after settling the ransom. Reports said it](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-enters-big-league-with-hundreds-breached-in-four-months/)\nlacked proper functionality and claimed that the Master Boot Records of their virtual machines were corrupted, rendering them incapable of\nbooting.\n\n## Top affected countries and industries\n\nThis section cites Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN) data on Hive’s attempts to compromise organizations. Our detections\nshow that Hive ransomware attack attempts against organizations were observed the most in South America, with Argentina receiving the\nhighest number followed by Brazil. The United States takes the third spot, while the rest are spread across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nFigure 1. 10 countries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for Hive ransomware (August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\nThe energy sector had the highest number of attack attempts at 186; healthcare came in second at 125, followed by the financial sector with\n102 detections.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. 10 industries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for Hive ransomware (August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\nBy breaking down the detections per month, our findings reveal that attack attempts peaked in November 2021 at 429. Hive operators were\nmost active in the fourth quarter of 2021 as detections in December and October were the second and third highest numbers, respectively.\n\nFigure 3. Monthly breakdown of detections per machine for Hive ransomware (August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\n## Targeted regions and sectors according to Hive’s leak site\n\nAn examination of the information that can be found on HiveLeaks reveals the number of successfully compromised companies that, as of this\nwriting, have declined to pay the ransom. In our monitoring of their leak site from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022, attacks were\nhighest in North America at 45.2% followed by Europe at 29% and Latin America at 12.9%.\n\nFigure 4. Regional distribution of Hive victims according to the group’s leak site (December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n\nEnterprises appear to be Hive’s preferred targets estimated at almost 40%. Their victims were from a wide range of sectors, with technology at\nthe top of the list having a victim count of 5. The healthcare and transportation sectors follow at 4 victims each. Other affected industries\ninclude construction, media and entertainment, professional services, retail, materials, automotive, apparel and fashion.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Sector distribution of Hive victims according to the group’s leak site (December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n\nData observed in the same time frame showed that most of the attacks took place on weekdays as malicious activities on weekends comprise\nonly 6.5%.\n\n## Infection chain and techniques\n\nFigure 6. Infection chain of Hive ransomware\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nHive operators breach systems through phishing emails with malicious attachments. We also observed Microsoft Exchange as a possible\nentry point for Hive ransomware based on our detection of the same post-exploitation scripts that can be found in the technique used to exploit\n[ProxyShell-related vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were identified as CVE-2021-31207,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/analyzing-proxyshell-related-incidents-via-trend-micro-managed-x.html) [CVE-2021-34473 and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34473) [CVE-2021-34523.](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34523)\n\n**Execution**\n\n[Hive operators attempt to run the persistence technique for a Cobalt Strike beacon that can be used as a C&C method to accomplish lateral](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/tracking_cobalt_strike_a_vision_one_investigation.html#:~:text=Cobalt%20Strike%20is%20a%20well,and%20remove%20a%20malware%20infection.)\nmovement once they intrude into the system. Right after the attempt, Hive operators start to unload or uninstall antivirus (AV) products in the\n[system so they can proceed to the download and execution of hacking tools such as PCHunter,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/PUA.Win64.PCHunter.A/) [GMER, and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/pua.win32.gmer.a/) [TrojanSpy.DATASPY. They use](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/trojanspy.ps1.dataspy.a/)\n[these tools to unload other AV products as a tactic to evade detection. We also observed the presence of WMI used to deploy uninstallation](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-understanding-wmi-malware.pdf)\nscripts and ransomware across the networks for lateral movement.\n\n**Defense Evasion, Discovery, and Credential Access**\n\nWe observed the presence of PCHunter and GMER as their tools to discover and terminate services or processes to disable AV software. We\nalso detected the use of TrojanSpy.DATASPY to gather information in the system such as machines in the network and the presence of\n[specific AV products. In another attack, the threat actors deployed KillAV to terminate several AV products, also to avoid detection.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/trojan.win32.killav.wlde/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**,**\n\nThe Hive gang uses RDP and WMI to move laterally in the compromised network and deliver the payload remotely. We also detected the use\nof a [BITSAdmin command for lateral movement. The threat actors also used PsExec to move laterally within the network.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/microsoft-discovers-fileless-malware-campaign-dropping-astaroth-info-stealer)\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\n[Our detections showed that the Hive operators use 7-Zip tool to archive stolen data for exfiltration. Moreover, the gang abuses anonymous file-](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/major-security-flaws-found-in-7-zip)\nsharing services such as MEGASync, AnonFiles, SendSpace, and uFile to exfiltrate data.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe ransomware payload proceeds with the encryption routine upon execution. The ransomware generates a random key that is used to\n[encrypt based on RTLGenRandom API, which will be initially saved on the device’s memory. The key is then used in what appears to be a](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecapi/nf-ntsecapi-rtlgenrandom)\ncustom implementation of the encryption process.\n\n[The key also encrypts through RSA via](https://www.britannica.com/topic/RSA-encryption) [GoLang’s implementation of RSA encryption. It accomplishes the RSA encryption through a list of](https://golangdocs.com/rsa-encryption-decryption-in-golang)\npublic keys embedded in the binary. It is then saved as .key. on the encrypted drive.\n\nThe generated key will then be wiped from memory, leaving the encryption key as the only copy of the key for decryption.\n\n## MITRE tactics and techniques\n\n\n**Initial**\n**Access** **Execution** **Persistence** **Defense Evasion** **Discovery**\n\n\n**Lateral**\n**Movement** **Collection**\n\n\n**T1566.001 -**\nPhishing:\nSpearphishing\nattachment\n\n_Arrives via_\n_phishing_\n_emails._\n\n**T1190 -**\nExploit\npublic-facing\napplication\n\n_Arrives via_\n_any the_\n_following_\n_exploits:•_\n_CVE-2021-_\n_34473• CVE-_\n_2021-_\n_34523• CVE-_\n_2021-31207_\n\n**T1078 -

Our detections of their malicious activities show that their operations are robust, thus providing an incentive for new affiliates to join\nthem. Hive operators are also known to constantly refine and diversify their TTPs, so it is important for companies to stay vigilant and be wellinformed of potential threats. An organization stands a better chance of addressing ransomware threats if they implement strong defenses\nearly on.\n\nTo protect systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that allocate resources systematically for\nestablishing a strong defense strategy against ransomware.\n\nHere are some best practices that organizations can consider:\n\n**Audit and inventory**\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software\nAudit event and incident logs\n\n**Configure and monitor**\n\n\n-----\n\na age a d a e a d so t a e co gu at o s\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications\n\n**Patch and update**\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications\nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions\n\n**Protect and recover**\n\nImplement data protection, backup, and recovery measures\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA)\n\n**Secure and defend**\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning\n\n**Train and test**\n\nRegularly train and assess employees on security skills.\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into their system (endpoint, email, web, and network).
