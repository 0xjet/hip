A few months later, we began working together with fellow malware analysts from ESET](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/05/14/mikroceen-spying-backdoor-high-profile-networks-central-asia/)\nto analyze samples used by the group to spy on a telecommunications company, a gas company,\nand a governmental institution in Central Asia. An APT group, which we believe could possibly be\nfrom China, planted backdoors to gain long-term access to corporate networks. Based on our\nanalysis, we suspect the group was also behind attacks active in Mongolia, Russia, and Belarus.\n\nThe group behind the attack frequently recompiled their custom tools to avoid AV detection,\nwhich, in addition to the backdoors, included Mimikatz and Gh0st RAT. This has led to a large\nnumber of samples, with binaries often protected by VMProtect, making analysis more difficult.\n\nThe backdoors gave the actors the ability to manipulate and delete files, take screenshots,\nmanipulate processes, and services, as well as execute console commands, remove itself, and\nmore. Further, some commands may have instructed the backdoors to exfiltrate data to a C&C\nserver. Infected devices could also be commanded by a C&C server to act as a proxy or listen on\na specific port on every network interface. The group also used tools such as Gh0st RAT and\nManagement Instrumentation to move laterally within infiltrated networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Timeline\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of events related to the tracking of Microcin, and Avast notifying the targeted company\n\n_Avast’s and Eset’s antivirus engines blocked the samples used by the APT group prior to it_\n_attracting our attention, as our antivirus engines’ detections are automated._\n\n## Attribution & Clusterization\n\n[The samples we analyzed contain links to malware samples and campaigns, such as Microcin,](https://securelist.com/a-simple-example-of-a-complex-cyberattack/82636/)\n[BYEBY, and Vicious Panda, previously described by Kaspersky, Palo Alto Networks, and Check](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-threat-actors-target-government-belarus-using-cmstar-trojan/)\nPoint, respectively. The backdoors we found are custom tools that have not previously been\nanalyzed, as far as we know. The majority of the C&C servers are registered to Choopa, LLC, a\n[hosting platform that has been used by cybercriminals in the past. A GoDaddy registrar was also](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting)\nseen early in the campaign, these servers were removed early on.\n\nWe suspect the APT group behind these attacks is from China. Gh0st RAT, one of the tools used,\nhas been known to be used by Chinese APT groups in the past. Similarities in the code used in\n[the Vicious Panda campaign, (TTPS, especially the use of the RTF Weaponizer in the infection](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/)\nvector), which is also thought to have come from China, and the code we analyzed, also lead us\nto believe the group might be from China. The targeted companies and institutions, as well as the\nprofessional coding point to an APT group.\n\n## Toolset\n\n### Backdoors\n\n\n-----\n\nThroughout our analysis, we stumbled upon the following backdoors. Details on these backdoors\nare provided below the complete list of backdoors.\n\n**_sqllauncher.dll_** (VMProtected backdoor)\n\nbbc5a9a49757abdbfcaca22f3b2a8b7e79f61c30d31812a0ccc316536eb58ca3\nC&C server 45.76.132[.]207\n\n**_logon.dll (VMProtected backdoor)_**\n\n61e4c91803d0d495681400fb9053b434f4852fdad1a305bbcec45ee0b2926d6a\nC&C server 45.76.132[.]207\n\n**_logsupport.dll_** (VMProtected backdoor)\n\nd5c1e947d84791ac8e6218652372905ddb7d3bc84ff04e709d635f60e7224688\nC&C server 104.194.215[.]194\n\n**_pcaudit.bat_**\n\n1395B863AE5697EA5096F4E2EBEF54FC20D5380B6921F8835D1F030F2BA16A40\n\n## Technical details (pcaudit.bat)\n\n_pcaudit.bat is a batch file that is used to invoke the svchost.exe in order to load the DLL file for a_\ngiven service specified in the registry. This batch file is responsible for the backdoor’s\npersistence. The contents of the pcaudit.bat script can be found below:\n\nFigure 2: The batch file that is responsible for the backdoor’s persistence\n\n## Technical details (sqllauncher.dll, logon.dll)\n\nBoth DLLs, sqllauncher.dll and logon.dll, are primarily used as backdoors. These are installed as\nservices by the aforementioned batch file. They both create a log file under the path:\n_%COMMON_DOCUMENT%\\WZ9JuN00.tmp aggregating errors during the backdoor’s runtime._\nEach entry contains an error code, an error message, and a timestamp formatted as “[yyyy-mm_dd hh-mm-ss] %error code% %message%”._\n\nIf the infected device can’t connect to the C&C server, the malware attempts to determine\nwhether the traffic is routed through a proxy. This information may be retrieved either from\n_%WINDOWS%\\debug\\netlogon.cfg or from the TCP table. After successfully connecting to the_\n\n\n-----\n\nC&C server, a secure communication channel (Schannel) is established and telemetry (OS\nversion, username) is sent to the C&C server. The following commands are issued by the C&C\nserver:\n\n\n#### Com‐ mand\n\n AmbYD‐ kEx\n\n eYTS5I‐ wW\n\n\n#### Sub‐ Com‐ mand\n\n\n#### – – Send malware version to the C&C\n\n – – Terminate previously launched payload\n\n\n#### Parameter Description Original com‐ mand\n\n\n#### Ki0Swb7I – – Send all used drive let‐ ters to the C&C\n\n\n#### WELCOM\n\n LIST D\n\n\n#### 5fdi2TfG – – Start remote shell STARTC\n\n\n#### h71R‐ BG8X\n\n\n#### – %command% Execute “cmd %com‐ mand%” via CreatePro‐ cess API\n\n\n#### J8AoctiB QHb‐ U0hQo\n\n J8AoctiB hwuv‐ E43y\n\n\n#### %path%, %subcommand%\n\n %path%, %subcommand%,%data%\n\n\n#### Read from %path% and send data to C&C\n\n Write %data% into %path%\n\n\n#### gRQ7m‐ IYr\n\n\n#### – %command% Execute %command% via CreateProcess API\n\n\n#### UPLOAD\n\n DOWNLO\n\n EXECUT\n\n\n## Technical details (logsupport.dll)\n\nSimilarly to the previous DLLs, the logsupport.dll is primarily used as a backdoor, but uses a\ndifferent C&C server than the other backdoors. Its corresponding log file is located at\n_%TEMP%\\rar%[A-Z0-9]{4}%.tmp. The structure of the log file is also the same. The main_\ndifference is that the log file is encrypted by a XOR cipher with a hardcoded key.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Log file is decrypted by a XOR cipher with a hardcoded key\n\nThis backdoor checks whether the malware is running in a virtualized environment. Additionally,\nthe DLL fingerprints the infected device (NETBIOS name, IP address, username, OS version,\nMAC address and RAM usage, OEM code page, token information, number of CPU cores,\nis64bit), and sends this information to the C&C server.\n\nThe communication with the C&C server is encrypted by a simple stream cipher. If the malware\nfails to establish an encrypted channel, it checks whether a proxy is being used, using different\nmethods than the previous two DLLs. It tries to connect to http://www.google.com/index.asp and\nretrieve information about a possible proxy from the connection, and it also checks the value of\n_ProxyServer in the Windows registry key:_\n\n_HKLM\\Software\\Microsft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings._\n\nBased on what we saw in the code, the backdoor is also capable of accepting various commands\nfrom the C&C server. These commands allow the backdoor to manipulate files (move, read,\ndelete, check existence), manipulate processes (create, terminate, retrieve parent, and process\nID) and Windows services (start, stop, check), execute console commands, remove itself, and\nmore. Some of these commands (read/check file, check services, check processes) also send\ndata back to C&C. The infected device can also be commanded by C&C to act as a proxy or\nlisten on a specific port on every network interface.\n\nInterestingly, the backdoor has a set of commands specifically targeting files with .tu and .tut file\nextension. These commands may similarly check for their existence, send their content back to\nthe C&C, and modify their content (append or rewrite by data given by the C&C server).\n\n## Other tools\n\n### Lateral Movement via Mimikatz\n\n\n-----\n\nfc66353fb26fd82227700beb47c4fa90118cea151eb1689fd8bf48e93fda71d0\n\n[Mimikatz is an open source project by a French security researcher named Benjamin Delpy which](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\nstarted in 2007. It is a robust tool that exploits various Windows authentication schemes and\ndumps credential-related data from a Windows Local Security Account database. For these\nreasons it is often misused by a wide spectrum of APT actors such as the Lazarus Group or\nTelebots.\n\nThe Mimikatz version used in this campaign has a two-stage installation mechanism (installer.exe\ninstalling Yokel64.exe and mktz64.dll), and contains a PDB string\n“E:\\2018_\\MimHash\\mimikatz\\Bin\\mktzx64.pdb”. Calling a mktz64.dll exported function\n_MktzDumpbyInjection inside our testing virtual machine yields the following output:_\n\n#### #1 domain = MSEDGEWIN10, user = Administrator,nthash=FC525C9683E8FE067095BA2DDC971889 #2 domain = MSEDGEWIN10, user = IEUser, nthash=FC525C9683E8FE067095BA2DDC971889\n\n### Lateral Movement via WMI\n\n2615e5585a5db77b973c74e0a87551978a9322c820362a148a995e571923b59c\n\nThe lateral movement via WMI is done with a file that parses its own filename, which we suspect\nuses the following format: “@@<ComputerName>,<UserName>,<Password>,.exe”. Afterwards,\nthe data described in the filename is extracted and used to establish a remote console to a\ncomputer identified by the retrieved name. Afterwards, Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI) is leveraged to set a strict proxy security, leading to the encryption of arguments of each\nremote procedure call, and allowing the server to access local resources. Then WMI is used\nagain to retrieve the Win32_Process class which in turn is used to create a process with given\nparameters. At the end, it terminates itself.\n\n### Gh0st RAT\n\n3a3b05a08180013a37fbdbe65e3fe017440c1cb34289647ef1f60316964ef6a9\n\nGh0st RAT is an old well-known backdoor, predominantly associated with East-Asian attackers. It\nis commonly assumed that its source code is widely available. Its presence is often indicated by a\nfile named rastls.dll, using an export DLL name svchost.dll and containing a string Gh0st. A string\n_uwqixgze} is used as a placeholder for the C&C domain._\n\nThe version we’ve seen in this campaign tries to connect to https://yuemt.zzux[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Gh0st RAT malware\n\n## Code Similarities\n\nWhile analyzing one of the files, we noticed that it has several correlations to the Microcin sample\nfrom 2017, the BYEBY sample from 2017, and Vicious Panda: The COVID campaign from 2020.\nFigure 5 below provides a comparison of the decryption loop used to decrypt the main\nconfiguration data of the first backdoor.\n\nFigure 5: Part of code used to decipher the main configuration data\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Name of file\n\n\n#### SHA256\n\n\n#### irmon.dll 170008187EBCEF183E792513608B82572FAF0AAEB33212BFA44736439453218F\n\n\n#### crypt‐ base.dll\n\n NWC‐ Work‐ sta‐ tion.dll\n\n nwsapa‐ gent.dll\n\n\n#### 383A2D8F421AD2F243CBC142E9715C78F867A114B037626C2097CB3E070F67D6\n\n 2A42F500D019A64970E1C63D48EEFA27727F80FE0A5B13625E0E72A6EC98B968\n\n 92315CDCDD3ECDAFBAC1D46EF872AAA333E1EA159D662CB61C4‐ FA029D3896DF7\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAvast reported its findings to the local CERT team and reached out to the telecommunications\ncompany. We have not heard back from either organization.\n\nAvast has recently protected users in Central Asia from further attacks using the samples we\nanalyzed. This, along with tying elements of the samples we discovered back to attacks carried\nout on other countries, makes me assume the group is still active.\n\nI would like to thank Peter Kalnai from ESET for working with me on the analysis, Lukáš Obrdlík,\nand Adolf Středa from Avast for helping me with this research, as well as Alexey Shulmin from\nKaspersky for his support.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)\n\n[Repository: https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/Microcin](https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/Microcin)\n[List of SHA-256: https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/Microcin/samples.sha256](https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/Microcin/samples.sha256)\n\n## References\n\nVasily Berdnikov, Dmitry Karasovsky, Alexey Shulmin: “Microcin malware”, Kaspersky Labs 20179-25 https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wpcontent/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07170759/Microcin_Technical_4PDF_eng_final_s.pdf\n\nJosh Grunzweig, Robert Falcone: “Threat Actors Target Government of Belarus Using CMSTAR\nTrojan”, Palo Alto Networks, September 2017, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-threatactors-target-government-belarus-using-cmstar-trojan/\n\nCheckpoint Research: “Vicious Panda: The COVID Campaign”, 2020-03-12\n[https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/)\n\n[Avast Threat Intelligence https://github.com/avast/ioc](https://github.com/avast/ioc)\n\n\n-----\n\n[ESET Threat Intelligence https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc)\n\nDhia Mahjoub, Jeremiah O’Connor, Thibault Reuille, Thomas Mathew: “Phishing, Spiking, and\nBad Hosting”, Cisco Umbrella Blog, 2015-09-14\n\n[https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/14/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting/](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/14/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting/)\n\n[https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\n\n\n-----",
