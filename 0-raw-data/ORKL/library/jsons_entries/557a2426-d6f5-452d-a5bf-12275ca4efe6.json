Although the vendor uses processes and technology measures in an effort to limit distribution of Cobalt\n[Strike to security professionals, adversaries have also been observed using Cobalt Strike. In the CrowdStrike 2020 Threat Hunting Report, The](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/threat-hunting-report-2020/)\n[Falcon OverWatch team reported Cobalt Strike as the #2 most common penetration testing tool observed in the first half of 2020.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/penetration-testing/)\n\nA common feature used by adversaries is the Cobalt Strike framework client agent, known as Beacon. The Beacon client agent is executed in\nthe memory space of a compromised system, typically leaving minimal on-disk footprints. This blog discusses CrowdStrike’s research and\ntesting of Cobalt Strike’s Beacon in an isolated Active Directory domain to identify host-based indicators generated from the use of this tool.\n\nThis blog also enumerates and provides an explanation of host-based artifacts generated as a result of executing specific built-in Beacon\ncommands. The artifacts can be used to create detection and prevention signatures in Windows environments, aiding in the positive\nidentification of remnants of Beacon execution.\n\n## Beacon Behavior Summary\n\nAdversaries often execute a variety of Beacon commands once they establish a foothold within an environment. Beacon commands can be\nused to spawn other Beacons on additional systems accessible to the initial Beacon, effectively furthering persistence in the target\nenvironment. Beacons can also be leveraged for remote access and execution.\n\nThe execution of the commands highlighted in this blog will generate a variety of Windows security events depending on the context of\nthe command: The Beacon commands `jump psexec and` `jump psexec_psh will generate an EID 7045 (Service Installation) from`\n```\n   System.evtx .\n\n```\nThe additional commands will generate an EID 400 event log (PowerShell Engine Startup) from Windows `PowerShell.evtx .`\n\n\n-----\n\ne ajo ty o o e S e g e Sta tup e e ts ge e ated by Coba t St e a e t e `ost pp` `cat o` e d beg t a co a d\nprefix. With the default configuration that command prefix is `powershell -nop -exec -bypass -EncodedCommand . Although this prefix is`\nconfigurable, CrowdStrike has observed adversaries leverage the default configuration in multiple incident response (IR) engagements.\n\n## Beacon Commands\n\nAs part of our research, CrowdStrike Services evaluated the following Beacon commands, which are encountered frequently in incident\nresponse engagements:\n\npowershell and powershell-import\npowerpick\njump psexec\njump psexec_psh\njump winrm\nremote-exec wmi\nremote-exec powershell\n\nIn the following sections we’ll review the purpose behind each of these commands, and the artifacts generated that may be useful for security\nanalysts and threat hunters.\n\n### The powershell and powershell-import Commands\n\nBoth of these commands have a similar aim: to allow the user to execute PowerShell scripts on the target system. The `powershell` Beacon\ncommand executes commands written in PowerShell within the Cobalt Strike framework. When a red teamer or an adversary executes a\ncommand within a Beacon session, the operating system will generate an EID 400 event log (PowerShell Engine Startup) on the system that\nthe command is executed on. The `powershell-import Beacon command imports a PowerShell script into the Beacon session. In several`\nWastedLocker ransomware attacks, CrowdStrike Services[1] observed evidence of the network discovery tool PowerView imported by\nadversaries shortly after establishing a Beacon on a compromised system. The file system artifacts that are generated will vary depending on\nwhether the `powershell command is executed before or after the` `powershell-import command.`\n\n**Artifacts generated before** `powershell-import`\n\nFigure 1 shows an example of the EID 400 event log generated by the execution of the `powershell command before a script has been`\nimported with `powershell-import . The base64 encoded command decodes to ls, the command that was executed via the` `powershell`\ncommand.\n\n**Observations of** `powershell before` `powershell-import :`\n\nThe `HostApplication field is set to` `powershell -nop -exec -bypass -EncodedCommand <base64-encoded-command>`\nThe Base64 encoded command decodes to the `<command> executed`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Artifact generated by the `powershell command before` `powershell-import is executed (click image to enlarge)`\n\nAn example of the observed artifact as shown in Figure 1:\n```\nHostApplication=powershell -nop -exec Bypass -EncodedCommand bABzAA==\nDecoded Base64 Command: ls\n\n```\n\n**Artifacts generated after** `powershell-import`\n\nFigure 2, shows an example of the EID 400 generated on the compromised system after execution of the powershell command after a script\nwas imported with powershell-import. The base64 encoded command decodes to IEX (New-Object\nNet.Webclient).DownloadString(‘http://127.0.0.1:22426/’); ls . The IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString(‘http://127.0.0.1:22426/’)\ncomponent of the base64 encoded command is how Cobalt Strike manages imported PowerShell scripts within a Beacon session. The rest of\nthe command, after the DownloadString component, is the PowerShell command run by the adversary.\n\n**Observations from** `powershell after` `powershell-import :`\n\nThe `HostApplication field is set to` `powershell -nop -exec -bypass -EncodedCommand <base64-encoded-command>`\nThe base64 encoded command decodes to IEX `(New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:<ephemeral-`\n\n```\nport-number>/'); <command>\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Artifact generated by the `powershell command after` `powershell-import is executed (click image to enlarge)`\n\nAn example of the observed artifact as shown in Figure 2:\n```\nHostApplication=powershell -nop -exec Bypass -EncodedCommand\nSQBFAFgAIAAoAE4AZQB3AC0ATwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABOAGUAdAAuAFcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBEAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAUwB0AHIAaQBuAGcA\nBase64 Command: IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:24192/'); ls\n\n### The powerpick Command\n\n```\nThe `powerpick Beacon command executes unmanaged PowerShell on a compromised system. It provides a way to execute a PowerShell`\ncommand without invoking `powershell.exe . When a red teamer or adversary executes the` `powerpick command through a Beacon`\nsession, the filesystem will generate an EID 400 event log (PowerShell Engine Startup) on the compromised system.\n\nCrowdStrike observed that the EID 400 event log generated by executing the `powerpick command will contain a mismatch between the`\nversion number in the `HostVersion and` `EngineVersion event log fields. The event generated will also have the path to the`\n```\nrundll32.exe executable in the HostApplication field, as it is the default program that a Beacon will use to create a new process.\n\n```\n**Observations of** `powerpick :`\n```\n   HostName field is set to ConsoleHost\n   HostApplication field is set to the file path of rundll32.exe\n\n```\nThe HostVersion and `EngineVersion fields are set to different values`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Artifact generated by the `powerpick Beacon command when executed (click image to enlarge)`\n\nAn example of the observed artifact as shown in Figure 3:\n```\nHostName=ConsoleHost\nHostApplication=C:\\windows\\sysnative\\rundll32.exe\nHostVersion=1.0\n\n```\n```\nEngineVersion=5.1.17763.1\n\n### The jump psexec Command\n\n```\nThe `jump psexec Beacon command establishes an additional Beacon on a remote system. When an adversary executes the` `jump`\n```\npsexec command through a Beacon session, the filesystem will generate an EID 7045 event log (Service Installation) on the remote system.\n\n```\n**Observations of** `jump psexec :`\n\nThe Service Name field is set to `<7-alphanumeric-characters>`\nThe Service File Name field is set to `\\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\<7-alphanumeric-characters>.exe`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Artifact generated by the `jump psexec Beacon command when executed on the remote system prior to version 4.1 of Cobalt Strike (click image to`\n\nenlarge)\n\nAn example of the observed artifact as shown in Figure 4:\n```\nService Name: af5ce43\nService File Name: \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\af5ce43.exe\n\n```\nBy default, events generated by the `jump psexec Beacon command using versions of Cobalt Strike prior to version 4.1 will have the`\n```\n127.0.0.1 localhost string in the value of the “Service File Name,” an example of this is \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\7f5747a.exe . Events\n\n```\ngenerated with version 4.1+ of Cobalt Strike will contain the destination computer’s IP address in the “Service File Name” by default and an\nexample of this is `\\\\10.0.0.16\\ADMIN$\\9a845c4.exe . In that example` `10.0.0.16 is the IP address assigned to the target system.`\n\n**Observations of** `jump psexec after version 4.1 of Cobalt Strike:`\n\nThe Service Name field is set to `<7-alphanumeric-characters>`\nThe Service File Name field is set to `\\\\<System-IPAddress>\\ADMIN$\\<7-alphanumeric-characters>.exe`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Artifact generated by the `jump psexec Beacon command when executed on the remote system created by version 4.1+ of Cobalt Strike (click image to`\n\nenlarge)\n\n### The jump psexec_psh Command\n\nThe `jump psexec_psh command establishes an additional Beacon on a remote system via the Windows Service Control Manager. The`\n```\njump_psexec command creates and starts a service that executes a base64 encoded PowerShell Beacon stager, which generates an EID\n\n```\n7045 event log (Service Installation) on the remote system.\n\nThe EID 7045 event log created by the `jump psexec_psh command has a seven-character alphanumeric value for the “Service Name” field`\nof the created event. The “Service File Name” field starts with the default Cobalt Strike prefix for PowerShell services `%COMSPEC% /b /c`\n```\nstart /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand .\n\n```\n**Observations of** `jump psexec_psh :`\n\nThe Service Name field is set to `<7-alphanumeric-characters>`\nThe Service File Name field is set to `%COMSPEC% /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand <base64-`\n```\n   encoded-command>\n\n```\nThe base64 encoded command decodes to a PowerShell stager for a Cobalt Strike Beacon\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Artifact generated by the `jump psexec_psh Beacon command when executed on the remote system (click image to enlarge)`\n\nAn example of the observed artifact as shown in Figure 6:\n```\nService Name: 9df3724\nService File Name: %COMSPEC% /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand JABzA<Redacted>\n\n### The jump winrm Command\n\n```\nThe `jump winrm Beacon command establishes a Beacon on a remote system utilizing the Windows Remote Management (WinRM)`\ninterface (native on all Windows devices). When the `jump winrm Beacon command is executed by an adversary through a Beacon session,`\nthe filesystem will generate an EID 400 event log (PowerShell Engine Startup) on the compromised system. The event created will contain the\nCobalt Strike PowerShell command prefix in the `HostApplication field. The generated event is not affected by the usage of any of the`\nPowerShell-related Beacon commands.\n\n**Observations of** `jump winrm on the compromised system:`\n\nThe `HostApplication field is set to` `powershell -nop -exec -bypass -EncodedCommand <base64-encoded-command>`\nThe base64 encoded command decodes to `IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString(‘http://127.0.0.1:<ephemeral-`\n\n```\nport-number>/’)\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Artifact generated by the `jump winrm Beacon command when executed, on the compromised system (click image to enlarge)`\n\nAn example of the observed artifact as shown in Figure 7:\n```\nHostApplication=powershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand\nSQBFAFgAIAAoAE4AZQB3AC0ATwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABOAGUAdAAuAFcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBEAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAUwB0AHIAaQBuAGcA\nBase64 Command: IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:28345/')\n\n```\nIf a WinRM listener is not present on the remote system when the `jump winrm command is executed, Cobalt Strike will create an EID 400`\nevent log on the remote system, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n**Observations of an event created by** `jump winrm on the remote system:`\n\nThe `HostApplication field is set to` `<path-to-PS-executable> -Version <PS-Version> -s -NoLogo -NoProfile`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8.

When the` `remote-exec wmi command is`\nexecuted, the filesystem will generate an EID 400 event log (PowerShell Engine Startup) on the compromised system with the standard Cobalt\nStrike PowerShell command prefix in the `HostApplication field.`\n\n**Observations of** `remote-exec wmi :`\n\nThe `HostApplication field is set to` `powershell -nop -exec Bypass -EncodedCommand <base64-encoded-command>`\nThe base64 encoded command decodes to `Invoke-WMIMethod win32_process -name create -argumentlist '<command>' -`\n\n```\nComputerName <target>\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9.

When the `remote-exec powershell command is executed, the filesystem will generate an EID 400 event log (PowerShell Engine`\nStartup) on the compromised system. The event created will contain the standard Cobalt Strike PowerShell command prefix in the\n```\nHostApplication field.\n\n```\n**Observations of** `remote-exec powershell :`\n\nThe `HostApplication field is set to` `powershell -nop -exec Bypass -EncodedCommand <base64-encoded-command>`\nThe Base64 encoded command decodes to `Invoke-Command -ComputerName <target> -ScriptBlock { <command> }`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10.

Due to the high prevalence of Cobalt Strike in contemporary intrusions, CrowdStrike recommends\ncollecting EID 400 (PowerShell Engine Startup) and EID 7045 event logs (Service Installation) for monitoring and alerting in a centralized\n[security information and event management (SIEM) platform.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/what-is-siem-in-cybersecurity/)\n\nCrowdStrike also recommends upgrading to the most recent version of PowerShell and disabling previous versions, as PowerShell is\nbackward compatible. While these additional security measures do not provide full visibility into Cobalt Strike activity, they can aid in its\ndetection.\n\n[1] CrowdStrike has previously reported on adversaries that use Cobalt Strike, such as [COBALT SPIDER.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-september-cobalt-spider/)\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Learn more about the CrowdStrike Services team and how it can help your organization improve your cybersecurity readiness.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/services/)_\n_[Read about the powerful CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)_\n_[Test CrowdStrike next-gen AV for yourself.
