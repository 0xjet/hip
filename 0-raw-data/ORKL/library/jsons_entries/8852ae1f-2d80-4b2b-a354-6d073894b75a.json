On July 9, it also sent cease-and-desist letters\nnotifying the two defendants that their conduct violated the platforms' terms and revoking\ntheir Facebook and Instagram access.\n\n\"Nonetheless, Defendants continued to create new Chime-impersonating accounts. In total,\nbetween June 5, 2020, and October 22, 2021, Meta disabled more than 800 Facebook and\nInstagram accounts and blocked phishing websites associated with Defendants and their\nscheme from being accessed on Facebook and Instagram.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThis action is part of a [broader series of lawsuits filed by Meta against threat actors abusing](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/legal-action/)\nits platform for malicious purposes and targeting its users.\n\nFor instance, Meta filed a lawsuit in December against the operators of over 39,000\nphishing sites targeting Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp users.\n\nThe same month, Meta also announced that it disrupted the operations of seven spywaremaking companies by blocking their infrastructure on its platform, sending cease and desist\nletters, and banning their accounts.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Intuit warns of QuickBooks phishing threatening to suspend accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intuit-warns-of-quickbooks-phishing-threatening-to-suspend-accounts/)\n\n[PDF smuggles Microsoft Word doc to drop Snake Keylogger malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pdf-smuggles-microsoft-word-doc-to-drop-snake-keylogger-malware/)\n\n[Phishing websites now use chatbots to steal your credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-websites-now-use-chatbots-to-steal-your-credentials/)\n\n[Spanish police dismantle phishing gang that emptied bank accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spanish-police-dismantle-phishing-gang-that-emptied-bank-accounts/)\n\n[Chime](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/chime/)\n[Facebook](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/facebook/)\n[Instagram](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/instagram/)\n[Lawsuits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/lawsuits/)\n[Meta](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/meta/)\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
