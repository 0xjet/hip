    "plain_text": "**Darien Huss and Matthew**\n\n**Mesa**\n\n**Overview**\n\n**Proofpoint recently observed a targeted email campaign attempting a spearphishing attack**\n\n**using a Game of Thrones lure. The malicious attachment, which offered salacious spoilers and**\n**video clips, attempted to install a “9002” remote access Trojan (RAT) historically used by state-**\n\n**sponsored actors. Previous attacks involving the 9002 RAT include:**\n\n\n\n**•**\n\n**•**\n\n\n**Operation Aurora, an attack on companies such as Google, widely attributed to the**\n\n**Chinese government [1,2]**\n\n**Operation Ephemeral Hydra, a strategic website compromise utilizing an Internet**\n\n**Explorer zero-day [3], which FireEye attributed to an APT actor without a country**\n**attribution**\n\n\n\n**•** **Attacks on Asian countries described by Palo Alto [4]**\n\n**Once installed, the 9002 RAT provides attackers with extensive data exfiltration capabilities.�**\n\n**Email Message**\n\n**On August 10 Proofpoint detected malicious email messages (Figure 1) purporting to contain**\n\n**unreleased Game of Thrones content. The email used the subject line \"Wanna see the Game**\n\n**of Thrones in advance?\" These lures are especially relevant since Season 7 of Game of**\n**_Thrones premiered in July and concludes on Sunday, August 27, and the email claims to_**\n\n**contain spoilers for the current season. It is worth noting that episodes 4 and 6 were already**\n\n**leaked; it is unlikely that responding to the lure would actually net a recipient new, unreleased**\n\n**episodes, particularly considering that the final episode airs this weekend.�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Email message with the potential spoilers (redacted) containing a .docx attachment_**\n\n**The email shown in Figure 1 contains a Microsoft Word attachment named \"game of thrones**\n\n**preview.docx” (Figure 2). Similar to the email, the document uses a lure listing potential**\n\n**spoilers and claims to contain a preview of the purported spoilers. In reality, the “preview” is an**\n\n**embedded .LNK (an OLE packager shell object) that, if run, executes a malicious PowerShell**\n\n**script leading to the installation of the diskless “9002” RAT.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: .docx document attachment containing a malicious .LNK packager object_**\n\n**Payload Analysis**\n\n**When the embedded .LNK object is executed by the potential victim, it runs a PowerShell**\n**command using a modified �Invoke-Shellcode [5] PowerShell script to download two files�**\n\n**obfuscated using XOR and base64. The first downloaded file contains the 9002 RAT shellcode�**\n**that is injected into a legitimate Windows Mail binary wabmig.exe. (Fig. 3). The other**\n\n**downloaded file is a .LNK file that is used as a means to maintain persistence on the infected�**\n**machine. The HTTP requests to retrieve the encoded payloads are fairly basic and do not**\n\n**attempt to masquerade as a legitimate browser request (Fig. 4). Interestingly, if the same URI**\n**is requested with any type of User-Agent then a legitimate JPG is returned (Fig. 5). The**\n\n\n-----\n\n**PowerShell script that is almost identical to the .LNK downloader. However, instead of**\n\n**downloading the shellcode, it opens, decodes, and injects the already downloaded shellcode**\n**into a newly created wabmig.exe process.**\n\n**_Figure 3: Excerpt from PowerShell script found in the LNK package_**\n\n**_Figure 4: HTTP request to download encoded payload_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: HTTP request with User-Agent receiving legitimate JPG instead of payload_**\n\n**This variant of 9002 is capable of communicating over both HTTP and what appears to be fake**\n**SSL. The fake SSL component contains at least two hardcoded packets: one for the**\n\n**_Client_Hello and another for the Client_Key_Exchange. Most of the hardcoded values, such as_**\n**the Session ID (Fig. 6,7), stay the same. However, the Random fields are dynamically�**\n**generated (GMT Unix Time and Random Bytes). Finally, the Client_Hello attempts to mimic**\n\n**SSL traffic to �login.live[.]com by sending that domain in the SNI field (Fig. 8).�**\n\n**_Figure 6: Client_Hello hardcoded Session ID in 9002_**\n\n**_Figure 7: Client_Hello hardcoded Session ID appearing in network traffic�_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The HTTP traffic and encoding that is utilized in this variant of 9002 has several distinguishing�**\n**characteristics. Data sent to the command and control (C&C) in the HTTP POST’s client body**\n**is transmitted in an encoded state using a custom algorithm followed by base64-encoding (Fig.**\n\n**9).**\n\n**_Figure 9: HTTP POST request sent to 9002 C&C_**\n\n**Several of the headers are hardcoded including the Accept and User-Agent headers:**\n\n**•** **_Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml,*/*_**\n\n**•** **_User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)_**\n\n**In addition, there are two different hardcoded URIs (Fig. 10):**\n\n**•** **_/?FORM=Desktop&setmkt=en-us&setlang=en-us_**\n\n**•** **_/config/signin�_**\n\n**A dynamically generated URI could also be used in the following format: “/%x.htm?”.**\n\n**_Figure 10: HTTP Post request sent to 9002 showing another hardcoded URI_**\n\n**The encoding algorithm used in this version is an iteration of the “4-byte XOR version of 9002”**\n**analyzed by FireEye [3]. Instead of the standard dynamic 4-byte XOR operation that is used in**\n\n**the older variant, a dynamic 4-byte XOR key is used along with a static 38-byte seed of**\n\n**“\\x3A\\x42\\x46\\x41\\x53\\x41\\x39\\x41\\x46\\x2D\\x44\\x38\\x37\\x32\\x6D\\xF1\\x51\\x4A\\xC0\\x2D\\x3A\\x**\n**_43\\x31\\x30\\x2D\\x30\\x30\\x43\\x30\\x35\\x4A\\x4D\\x39\\xF3\\xD3\\x38\\x2B\\x7D” to generate a final�_**\n\n**256-byte XOR key. To generate the final key, first the 38-byte seed is used with an iterative�**\n\n**addition to generate a 256-byte value (Fig. 11).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11: 256-byte seed initialization using iterative addition and static 38-byte seed value_**\n\n**Next, the first 4-bytes of the encoded data are XOR’ed with the 256-byte value to generate the�**\n**final 256-byte XOR key (Fig. 12). This key is then XOR’ed with the rest of the encoded data.�**\n\n**(Fig. 13)**\n\n**_Figure 12: Generation of final 256-byte XOR key�_**\n\n**_Figure 13: XOR’ing data with final 256-byte XOR key�_**\n\n**Similar to previous versions of 9002, a value resembling a date (“\\x17\\x05\\x15\\x20”) is**\n\n**hardcoded in the malware and can be found at offset 0x1C in beacons sent to its C&C (Fig.**\n\n**14).**\n\n**_Figure 14: Decoded 9002 traffic sent to its C&C showing the hardcoded value�_**\n\n**The value likely represents the date May 17, 2015, but we are not aware if this date has any**\n**significance. An additional value, �201707, is hardcoded in this variant which likely refers to July**\n\n**2017 (Fig. 15).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This is the most likely explanation, given that the earliest use of the malicious LNK PowerShell**\n\n**downloader (sha256:**\n**9e49d214e2325597b6d648780cf8980f4cc16811b21f586308e3e9866f40d1cd) we have**\n\n**identified is a compressed file (sha256:�**\n\n**bdd695363117ba9fb23a7cbcd484d79e7a469c11ab9a6e2ad9a50c678097f100) uploaded to a**\n**malicious file scanning service on July 6, 2017. The modified timestamp for the files contained�**\n\n**in the ZIP file is July 1, 2017. The ZIP package contains four copies of the same LNK that was�**\n\n**used in the Game of Thrones attack as well as a legitimate JPG of what appears to be a stock**\n\n**picture of a “party.” We have also identified a third possible campaign utilizing the same LNK in�**\n**a DOCX document attachment named “need help.docx” (Fig. 16). In this instance, the lure is**\n\n**to double-click on a LNK masquerading as a video.**\n\n**_Figure 16: Malicious document utilizing same LNK as ZIP and Game of Thrones document_**\n\n**Similar 2014 Campaigns**\n\n**While searching for other potentially related campaigns we discovered a nexus of activity**\n\n**occurring at least as far back as April 2014. Several ZIP compressed files containing a similar�**\n\n**LNK downloader (Fig. 17) were uploaded to a malicious file scanning service.�**\n\n**_Figure 17: Malicious LNK PowerShell downloader observed in archives from 2014_**\n\n**All five of the archives contained a similar stock picture of a party as well as multiple copies of�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**similar paths to the recent attacks as well as the same “/x/” URI. Instead of using code**\n\n**injection however, a packed executable (PE) is embedded in the PowerShell script, saved as**\n\n**_x.exe, and is used to execute the downloaded payload that is saved as y.exe. An additional_**\n**similarity is that the LNKs from the 2014 archives share the same Volume Serial Number as**\n\n**the LNK from the recent attacks (0xCC9CE694). The volume serial number is metadata found**\n\n**in the LNK file; since they match, we know it is more likely that they were created on the�**\n\n**device or using the same builder. It is possible to fake these values however we do not believe**\n**that likely in this case.**\n\n**Unfortunately we do not know what payload was hosted at mn1[.]org. However, two of the ZIP**\n\n**archives contained a Java payload named PhotoShow.jar that ultimately executes a diskless**\n\n**9002 variant with a C&C of mx[.]i26[.]org. This variant has a hardcoded identifier of�**\n**“\\x28\\x02\\x13\\x20” (Fig. 18).**\n\n**_Figure 18: 9002 hardcoded identifier�_**\n\n**Attribution**\n\n**Based on several shared identifiers, it is possible that the recent campaigns were conducted�**\n\n**by the same actor that conducted the campaigns in early- to mid-2014. The malicious LNK**\n\n**files in both campaigns (2014 vs. 2017) have the same Volume Serial Number of�**\n**0xCC9CE694. Furthermore, the LNK filename used in one of the campaigns this year is�**\n\n**almost identical to the campaigns in 2014: Party00[1-35].jpg.lnk (2017) vs. Party-00[1-**\n\n**5].jpg.lnk (2014). Finally, the theme of party pictures and stock-JPGs used in both the 2017**\n\n**and 2014 campaigns are extremely similar.**\n\n**The 2014 campaign resembles activity previously attributed to the Deputy Dog (aka APT17)**\n\n**actor. Additionally, the Deputy Dog actor has been observed utilizing a similar 9002 RAT with**\n\n**an earlier iteration of the 4-byte XOR encoding algorithm in diskless mode [3]. Another**\n**possible similarity is the use of some of the code from the Java Reverse Metasploit-Stager [6]**\n\n**in the exploits previously analyzed by FireEye [7] as well as the PhotoShow.jar payload.**\n\n**Although we do not possess any definitive evidence linking this activity to Deputy Dog, there�**\n\n**are enough similarities to support a possible connection.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n**Based on similarities in code, payload, file names, images, and themes, it is possible that this�**\n\n**attack was carried out by a Chinese state-sponsored actor known as Deputy Dog. The use of a**\n\n**_Game of Thrones lure during the penultimate season of the series follows a common threat_**\n**actor technique of developing lures that are timely and relevant, and play on the human factor**\n\n**- the natural curiosity and desire to click that leads to so many malware infections. While**\n\n**Proofpoint systems blocked this attack, the use of such lures, combined with sophisticated**\n\n\n-----\n\n**doors into corporate data and systems for the actors behind these attacks.**\n\n**References**\n\n**[1] https://community.saas.hpe.com/t5/Security-Research/9002-RAT-a-second-building-on-the-**\n**left/ba-p/228686#.WaBdzB9ifW8**\n\n**[2] http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/24/cyber-attack-on-us-firms-google-�**\n\n**traced-to-chinese/**\n\n**[3] https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/11/operation-ephemeral-hydra-ie-zero-�**\n**day-linked-to-deputydog-uses-diskless-method.html**\n\n**[4] https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/07/unit-42-attack-delivers-9002-trojan-**\n\n**through-google-drive/**\n\n**[5]**\n\n**https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/code_execution/Inv**\n\n**oke-Shellcode.ps1**\n\n**[6] http://security-is-just-an-illusion.blogspot.nl/2013/02/45-x-antivirus-software-fail-again-**\n**java.html**\n\n**[7] https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/05/ready-for-summer-the-sunshop-�**\n\n**campaign.html**\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Type**\n\n**http://27.255.83[.]3/x/** **URL** **9002 Shellcode**\n\n**http://27.255.83[.]3/y/** **URL** **Persistence LNK**\n\n**27.255.83[.]3** **IP** **9002 C2**\n\n**9e49d214e2325597b6d648780cf8980f4cc16811b21f586308e3e9866f40d1cd** **SHA256 LNK Object**\n\n**5a678529aea9195b787be8c788ef4bb03e38e425ad6d0c9fafd44ed03aa46b65** **SHA256 %APPDATA%\\y**\n\n**encoded 9002 s**\n\n**efdb6351ac3902b18535fcd30432e98ffa2d8bc4224bdb3aba7f8ca0f44cec79** **SHA256 game of thrones**\n\n**preview.docx**\n\n**bdd695363117ba9fb23a7cbcd484d79e7a469c11ab9a6e2ad9a50c678097f100** **SHA256 Party_photos_2**\n\n**192e8925589fa9a7f64cba04817c180e6f26ad080bf0f966a63a3280766b066a** **SHA256 need help.docx**\n\n**2014 IOCs**\n\n**774acdc37157e7560eca4a167558780e1cc2f5dfd203cbcb795ec05373d46fe0** **SHA256 Party-001.jpg.ln**\n\n\n**56dda2ed3cd67cadc53f4b9e493c4601e45c5112772ade5b0c36b61858ab7852**\n\n\n**SHA256 Photos2014021**\n\n\n**83151fe6980a39eeda961c6a8f0baba13b6da853661ccbf5c7d9a97ec73d1b70** **SHA256 Party-pics-2013**\n\n**b54d547e33b0ea6ba161ac4ce06a50076f1e55a3bc592a0fb56bbc34dc96fd43** **SHA256 Party_Photos_P**\n\n**db6b67704b77d271e40e0259a68ce2224504081545619d33b4909e6e6a385ec6 SHA256 Photos2014021**\n\n**fb8eff8dcf41a4cfd0b5775327a607b76269b725f1b46dc5dd04b1f5e2433ee7** **SHA256 PartyPics.7z**\n\n**559c0f2948d1d3179420eecd78b1e7c36c4960ec5d110c63bf6c853d30f1b308** **SHA256 PhotoShow.jar**\n\n**0b7613e0f739eb63fd5ed9e99934d54a38e56c558ab8d1a4f586a7c88d37a428** **SHA256 Upins_tmp.exe**\n\n**by PhotoShow.ja**\n\n**mn1[.]org** **Domain** **Party-001.jpg.ln**\n\n**mx.i26[.]org** **Domain** **PhotoShow.jar C**\n\n**ET and ETPRO Suricata/Snort Signatures**\n\n**2827624 ETPRO TROJAN Possible APT.9002 Fileless Variant CnC Beacon 1**\n\n**2827625 ETPRO TROJAN Possible APT.9002 Fileless Variant CnC Beacon 2**\n\n**2827661 ETPRO TROJAN Possible APT.9002 Fake SSL CnC Beacon**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Defray - New Ransomware Targeting Education and Healthcare Verticals**\n\n**Turla APT actor refreshes KopiLuwak JavaScript backdoor for use in G20-themed attack**\n\n**Threat actor goes on a Chrome extension hijacking spree**\n\n**Q2 Threat Report: High-volume malicious email campaigns, “ransomworms” make for**\n**eventful spring**\n\n**FIN7/Carbanak threat actor unleashes Bateleur JScript backdoor**\n\n**[Ransomware Survival Guide](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)**\n\n**[Threat Reference](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)**\n\n**[Proofpoint Blog](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)**\n\n**[Threat Insight Blog](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)**\n\n**[Events](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)**\n\n**[Media Contacts](https://www.proofpoint.com/us)**\n\n\n**About Proofpoint** **Board of**\n**Directors**\n\n**Careers** **Corporate Blog**\n\n**[Investors Center](http://investors.proofpoint.com)** **Leadership Team**\n\n**News Center**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Threat Insight (blog)** **Upgrade from McAfee**\n\n**United**\n**States** **[United Kingdom](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk)** **[France](https://www.proofpoint.com/fr)** **[Germany](https://www.proofpoint.com/de)** **[Spain](https://www.proofpoint.com/es)** **[Japan](https://www.proofpoint.com/jp)** **[Australia](https://www.proofpoint.com/au)**\n\n\n# 46 © 2017 .
