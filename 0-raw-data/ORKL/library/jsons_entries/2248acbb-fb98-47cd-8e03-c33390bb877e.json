This may be a way of walking, an accent, a\n\nturn of phrase or a style of dressing. If you know what to look for you can easily spot a friend or\n\nacquaintance in a crowd by knowing what characteristics to look for. Exactly the same is true for threat\n\nactors.\n\nEach threat actor group may have certain characteristics that they display during their attack campaigns.\n\nThese may be the types of malware that they use, a pattern in the naming conventions of their command\n\nand control servers, their choice of victims etc. Collecting attack data allows an observer to spot the\n\ncharacteristics that define each group and identify specific threat actors from the crowd of malicious\n\nactivity on the internet.\n\nTalos security and intelligence research group collects attack data from our various telemetry systems to\n\nanalyse, identify and monitor threat actors through their different tactics, techniques, and procedures.\n\nRather than give names to the different identified groups, we assign numbers to the threat actors. We\n\nfrequently blog about significant attack campaigns that we discover, behind the scenes we integrate our\n\nintelligence data directly into our products. As part of our research we keep track of certain threat actor\n\ngroups and their activities. In conjunction with a number of other security companies, we are taking\n\naction to highlight and disrupt the activities of the threat actors identified by us as Group 72.\n\n[Group 72 is a long standing threat actor group involved in Operation SMN, named Axiom by Novetta. The](http://www.novetta.com/blog/2014/14/cyber-security-coalition)\n\ngroup is sophisticated, well funded, and possesses an established, defined software development\n\nmethodology. The group targets high profile organizations with high value intellectual property in the\n\nmanufacturing, industrial, aerospace, defense, media sectors. Geographically, the group almost exclusively\n\ntargets organizations based in United States, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. The preferred tactics of the group\n\ninclude watering-hole attacks, spear-phishing, and other web-based tactics.\n\nThe tools and infrastructure used by the attackers are common to a number of other threat actor groups\n\nwhich may indicate some degree of overlap. We have seen similar patterns used in domain registration for\n\nmalicious domains, and the same tactics used in other threat actor groups leading us to believe that this\n\ngroup may be part of a larger organization that comprises many separate teams, or that different groups\n\nshare tactics, code and personnel from time to time.\n\nIt is possible that Group 72 has a vulnerability research team searching for 0-day vulnerabilities in\n\nWindows. The group is associated with the initial attack campaigns utilising exploits for the following\n\n[vulnerabilities CVE-2014-0322 and CVE-2012-4792 We have also observed them using SQL injection as](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=32870)\n\n\n-----\n\nFrequently the group deploys a remote access trojan (RAT) on compromised machines. These are used\n\nboth to steal data and credentials from compromised machines, and to use the machine as a staging post\n\nto conduct attacks against further systems on the network, allowing the attackers to spread their\n\ncompromise within the organization. Unlike some threat actors, Group 72 does not prefer to use a single\n\nRAT as part of their attacks. We have observed the group to use the following RAT malware:\n\nGh0st RAT (aka Moudoor)\n\nPoison Ivy (aka Darkmoon)\n\nHydraQ (aka 9002 RAT aka McRAT aka Naid)\n\nHikit (aka Matrix RAT aka Gaolmay)\n\nZxshell (aka Sensode)\n\nDeputyDog (aka Fexel) — Using the kumanichi and moon campaign codes\n\nDerusbi\n\nPlugX (aka Destroy RAT aka Thoper aka Sogu)\n\nHydraQ and Hikit, according to our data are unique to Group 72 and to two other threat actor\n\ngroups.\n\nWhile their operational security is very good, patterns in their domains can be identified such as\n\nseemingly naming domains after their intended victim. We have observed domains such as\n\n_companyname.attackerdomain.com and companyacronym.attackerdomain.com. We have also observed_\n\nsimilar patterns in the disposable email addresses used to register their domains. These slips, among\n\nothers, allow us to follow their activities. Intriguingly we have observed the same email address being used\n\nin the activities of this and two other threat actor groups. This may suggest that these three groups are\n\nindeed one unit, or possibly hint at shared staff or ancillary facilities.\n\nWe will post a follow up with more technical detail in the coming days.\n\nClamAV names and Snort Signature IDs detecting Group 72 RAT malware:\n\nGh0stRat — Win.Trojan.Gh0stRAT, 19484, 27964\n\nPoisonIVY / DarkMoon — Win.Trojan.DarkMoon, 7816, 7815, 7814, 7813, 12715, 12724\n\nHydraq — Win.Trojan.HyDraq, 16368, 21304\n\nHiKit — Win.Trojan.HiKit, 30948\n\nZxshell — Win.Trojan.Zxshell, 32180, 32181\n\nDeputyDog — Win.Trojan.DeputyDog, 28493, 29459\n\nDerusbi — Win.Trojan.Derusbi, 20080\n\n\n-----\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to detect](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/amp-firepower-software-license/tsd-products-support-series-home.html)\n\nthe sophisticated malware used by this threat actor.\n\n[CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html)\n\nwebsites, including watering hole attacks, and detects malware\n\nused in these attacks.\n\n[The Network Security protection of IPS and NGFW have up-to-](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/intrusion-prevention-system-ips/index.html)\n\ndate signatures to detect malicious network activity by threat\n\nactors.\n\n[ESA can block spear phishing emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n[Tags: APT, malware, Operation SMN, security, SMN, Talos, threats](http://blogs.cisco.com/tag/apt/)\n\n\n-----",
