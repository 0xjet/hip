Attack\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/united-nations-targeted-with-emotet-malware-phishing-attack/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/united-nations-targeted-with-emotet-malware-phishing-attack/)**\n\nLawrence Abrams\n\nBy\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nJanuary 14, 2020\n09:01 AM\n0\n\nPretending to be the Permanent Mission of Norway, the Emotet operators performed a\ntargeted phishing attack against email addresses associated with users at the United\nNations.\n\nYesterday, the Emotet trojan [roared back to life after a 3-week vacation with strong spam](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-restarts-spam-attacks-after-holiday-break/)\ncampaigns that targeted countries throughout the world.\n\nWhile Emotet's normal spam campaigns pretended to be fake accounting reports, delivery\nnotices, and invoices, the malware operators had something special in mind for the United\nNations.\n\n## Impersonating the \"Permanent Mission of Norway\"\n\nIn a sample of a phishing email shared with BleepingComputer by email security firm\n[Cofense, the Emotet operators pretend to be representatives of Norway at the United](https://cofense.com/)\nNations in New York, who state that there is a problem with an attached signed agreement.\n\nAccording to Cofense, this phishing campaign had \"highly specific targeting\" and was seen\nbeing sent to 600 unique email addresses at the United Nations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email states that the representatives of Norway found a problem with a signed\nagreement and that the recipient should review it to learn the issue.\n\n**Emotet spam targeting the United Nations**\nThe full text of this targeted phishing email can be read below:\n```\nHi,\nPlease be advised that the new problem has been appeared today.\nSee below our info for this question.\nPlease let me know if you need anything else.\nRegards\nPermanent Mission of Norway to the United Nations in New York\n\n```\nAttached to these emails is a Microsoft Word document that starts with \"Doc_01_13\" that\npretends to be the signed agreement being sent by the Permanent Mission of Norway.\n\nWhile there was room for Emotet to send a more convincing Word document template, they\ninstead sent the same one that is used for all of the malspam campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis template pretends to be a warning that the document only available for desktop or\nlaptop versions of Microsoft Office Word.\" It then prompts the user to click on 'Enable editing'\nor 'Enable Content' to view the document.\n\n**Malicious Email Attachment**\nIf a user opens the document and enables its content, malicious Word macros will be\nexecuted that downloads and installs Emotet on the computer.\n\nEmotet will now run in the background while sending out spam emails to other victims.\n\nEventually, Emotet will also install other payloads such as Trickbot, which would be when\nthings get really bad for the compromised UN workstation.\n\n## Emotet can lead to a full network compromise\n\nWhen Emotet is installed on a machine, one of the malware payloads that is invariably\ninstalled is the TrickBot trojan.\n\nThe [TrickBot trojan will attempt to harvest data from the computer such as cookies, login](https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/security-primer-trickbot/)\ncredentials, files from the computer, and possibly spread to other computers on the network.\n\nAfter the harvesting of information is finished, TrickBot is known to open a reverse shell back\nto the operators of Ryuk Ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese operators will proceed to infiltrate the network, gain administrator credentials, and\nultimately deploy Ryuk so that it encrypts every device on the network.\n\nThis is particularly worrisome for a UN network as ransomware operators are known to steal\ndata before encrypting files, which could expose extremely sensitive diplomatic or\ngovernment information.\n\nWhile there are no known victims of this phishing attack, this targeted attack illustrates that\nbad actors are constantly trying to get access to the networks of organizations and\ngovernment networks.\n\nThis is why it is imperative for all employees regardless of what sector they work in to be\nproperly trained on how to recognize phishing emails.\n\nFurthermore, before opening any attachments and enabling macros, users should notify their\nnetwork administrator and contact the alleged user who sent the email to confirm its\nauthenticity.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted the Permanent Mission of Norway about this attack but\nhas not heard back at this time.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Historic Hotel Stay, Complementary Emotet Exposure
