Trellix is continuing to add protections to our\nproducts via the Global Threat Intelligence (GTI) feed and content updates as new malware\nvariants and behavior indicators are discovered. The Trellix Advanced Programs Group\n(APG) is also monitoring the threat actors currently targeting the Ukraine and the threat\ntools being observed in those attacks, monitoring for usage of these tools in your\nenvironment can be a proactive step in detecting compromise of your infrastructure.\n\nAnalysis from the Trellix Advanced Threat Research (ATR) team into the activity of wipers\nbeing deployed within the Ukraine leads them to believe that there is a likely a connection\nbetween Whispergate, and the newly identified HermeticWiper.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1. Breakdown of Activity in the Ukrainian Region in the past 30 Days.

Trellix Global Threat Intelligence (GTI) is\ncurrently protecting against all known indicators associated with \"HermeticWiper\" and\nMVISION Insights will note detections in your environment as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2. Test system detections of HermeticWiper IOCS. Source: MVISION Insights**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3. Event details of successful containment of HermeticWiper by ENS.**\n\nHermeticWiper Threat Intelligence from MVISION Insights\n\nMVISION Insights will provide the current threat intelligence and known indicators for\nHermeticWiper. MVISION Insights will alert to detections and process traces that have been\nobserved and systems that require additional attention to prevent widespread infection.\nMVISION Insights will also include Hunting Rules for threat hunting and further intelligence\ngathering of the threat activity and adversary behind the campaign.\n\n**MVISION Insights Campaign Names: HermeticWiper Targeting Ukraine**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework for HermeticWiper Malware**\n\nDetecting Malicious Activity with MVISION EDR\n\n\n-----\n\nMVISION EDR is currently monitoring for the activity associated with HermeticWiper and\nwill note the MITRE techniques and any suspicious indicators related to the adversarial\nactivity. Detecting and preventing HermeticWiper from spreading throughout your\nenvironment is critical due to the destructive nature of the malware, once the\nHermeticWiper has infected a system it will remove the System Drivers and Windows files\nleaving the system inoperable.\n\n**Figure 7.

Once the deletion of data is complete, a reboot executes, and the system is**\n**no longer operable**\n\n### Featured Content\n\nPERSPECTIVES\n\n### Our CEO On Living Security\n\nBy [Bryan Palma · January 19, 2022](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/contributors/bryan-palma.html)\n\nTrellix CEO, Bryan Palma, explains the critical need for security that’s always learning.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/perspectives/our-ceo-on-living-security.html)\n\nXDR\n\n### Time to Drive Change by Challenging the Challengers\n\nBy [Michelle Salvado · January 19, 2022](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/contributors/michelle-salvado.html)\n\nDynamic threats call for dynamic security – the path to resiliency lies in XDR.\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/xdr/time-to-drive-change-by-challenging-the-challengers.html)\n\nTHREAT LABS\n\n### 2022 Threat Predictions\n\nBy Trellix · January 19, 2022\n\nWhat cyber security threats should enterprises look out for in 2022?\n\n[Read More](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/2022-threat-predictions.html)\n\n## Get the latest\n\nWe’re no strangers to cybersecurity.
