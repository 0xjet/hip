Let's take a look under the covers of one particular malware-as-a-service—the\nclipboard banker Allcome.\n\n## Underground marketing\n\n[Allcome clipbanker was first discovered by researcher @3xp0rtblog including underground](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog)\nforum screenshots, pricing information and a listing of contact numbers for Telegram where\nthe malware can be purchased and downloaded. This malware-as-a-service starts from 25$\nfor a month of usage up until 220$ for a life-time license.\n\nThe advertisment specifically highlights that Allcome supports stealing lots of different\ncryptocurrency wallets and payment forms with new payment forms added weekly. Criminal\ncustomers can also add their own currency stealing capabilities by purchasing a private\nquery builder.\n\nThe marketing for this malware might seem astounding, but what is really under the hood?\n\n\n-----\n\n### Banner translation\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nAllcome\n\nSteal yourself or someone will steal from you\n\nOur clipper is the best solution of all times\n\nOur advantages:\n\n- Security\n\n- Convenient builder\n\n- Fast response\n\n- Swift support\n\n- Weekly adding new services\n\n- Stealth\n\nClipper will steal funds from tens of currently available\n\nwallets and you will remain unnoticed.\n\nHas the functionality of\n\npayment link substitution and much more.\n\nTariff:\n\nBasic: $25 per month\n\nStandard: $35 for 3 months\n\nPremium: $90 for 2 months\n\nVIP: $220 forever\n\nAllcome_support\n\nSupport contact info\n\n## Functionality\n\n```\nAllcome is a relatively small (120 KB) native C/C++ program. All of the current versions have\nthe same persistent mechanism. They copy themselves into\n**%LOCALAPPDATA%\\CrashDumps\\subst.exe and then set up a scheduled task**\nnamed NvTmRep_CrashReport3_{B2FE1952-0186} to run the clipper every minute.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe clipper creates a mutex named 08841d-18c7-4e2d-f7e29d, then it checks if the\nfilename starts with 'subst'. It applies the peristence mechanism described above if it doesn't.\n\nThe clipper retrieves the encrypted C2 URL from the PE resources and decrypts it. This\ncontains not only the C2 domain but also delivers a username of the criminal customer as\nargument.\n\nThe server replies with either '+' or '-', depending on whether the criminal customer has a\nvalid license for the clipper. If the sever responds with '-', the clipper will not steal any\ninformation. If the response is anything else, the clipper starts checking and potentially\nreplacing the clipboard contents.\n\nCheck if clipboard content is an email\n\nThe core functionality is in the clipboard content checking and replacement function. Like\nevery clipbanker, Allcome replaces cryptocurrency addresses with the address of the\nattacker, so that transactions arrive at the attacker's wallet. The same is done for PayPal\n\n\n-----\n\naddresses, Steam trade offer URLs and more.\n\nThis content checking and replacement code turns out to be rather basic. The clipper mostly\nchecks the length of strings and one or two characters (mostly the start of the string). It does\nnot take care where the content comes from and it does not make an effort to avoid false\nclipboard content replacements.\n\nThe best example is the replacement for PayPal. If that option is used, any string containing\nan '@' and a '.' afterwards will be replaced with the attacker's email. So anytime someone\ncopies an email address, it will be changed, even if that is only used to write emails to\nsomeone. While the attacker may not mind receiving love letters, it also means the infection\nis noisy and users of infected systems will realize early on that something is not right.\n\n## Configuration Extractor\n\nThe configuration for C2 and replacement wallets, steam trade offers, PayPal emails etc is\nsaved as encrypted strings in the String Table in the PE resources. Every ID in the string\ntable corresponds to a certain address that is used to replace the clipboard content with.\n\nI wrote a decryption script in python to extract configurations en masse. The python script is\n[available in my Github repository and I added a list of extracted configurations there. Some](https://github.com/struppigel/hedgehog-tools)\nof the wallets have already transactions, possibly from infected systems. I collected the\nsamples via the VirusTotal query\n\"behaviour_network:dba692117be7b6d3480fe5220fdd58b38bf.xyz\"\n\nAllcome configuration in PE resources (click to enlarge)\n\n\n-----\n\nExtracted and decrypted configuration (click to enlarge)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnlike its elaborate marketing banner, Allcome clipbanker is very simple under the hood.\nEspecially its main functionality, the clipboard replacement, is not thought-out which is good\nfor potentially affected users, who will soon realize that something is wrong. Nevertheless it\nseems to have gained quite some traction. A quick VirusTotal search already came up with\n51 Allcome samples. Sometimes marketing is everything.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n[A list of hashes and their extracted configurations is in this file on Github.](https://github.com/struppigel/hedgehog-tools/blob/main/extracted_allcome_configs.txt)\n\n**Description** **Indicator**\n\nsha256 02b06acb113c31f5a2ac9c99f9614e0fab0f78afc5ae872e46bae139c2c9b1f6\n\nmutex name 08841d-18c7-4e2d-f7e29d\n\nfilepath %LOCALAPPDATA%\\CrashDumps\\subst.exe\n\n\nscheduled\ntask\ncommand\n\n\n/Create /tn NvTmRep_CrashReport3_{B2FE1952-0186} /sc MINUTE /tr %s\n\n\ndebug path C:\\Users\\youar\\Desktop\\Allcome\\Source code\\Build\\Release\\Build.pdb\n\nuser agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/93.0\n\nC2 server hxxp://dba692117be7b6d3480fe5220fdd58b38bf.xyz/exp(.)php\n\n\n-----\n\n**Karsten Hahn**\nMalware Analyst\n\n\n-----",
