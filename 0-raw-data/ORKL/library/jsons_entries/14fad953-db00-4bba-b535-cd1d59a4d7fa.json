    "plain_text": "# TA428 Group abusing recent conflict between Iran and USA\n\n**[lab52.io/blog/icefog-apt-group-abusing-recent-conflict-between-iran-and-eeuu/](https://lab52.io/blog/icefog-apt-group-abusing-recent-conflict-between-iran-and-eeuu/)**\n\nRecently, a suspicious document has caught our attention due to its recent creation date (0601-2020) and its title “How Swuleimani’s death will affect India and Pakistan.doc” which is\ndirectly related to recent political events between Iran and the USA.\n\nThe document is in RTF format, and has an OLE object related with the Equation Editor.\nDuring the last years, this OLE objects have been a good indicator that a document may aim\nto exploit the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in order to infect with some kind of malware. This\nparticular document turns out to be one of these examples, and does it by dropping a binary\ncalled 8.t. in the “% TEMP%” folder of the user.\n\nUp to this point, everything coincides in terms of TTPs with what is described in the following\nreport, from ProofPoint related with a suspected Chinese cybercrime Group known as\n[TA428.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/chinese-apt-operation-lagtime-it-targets-government-information-technology)\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter this infection chain, what we get is a DLL executable file with extension .wll used for\n“Word.addin.8” files, that is installed in the path “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP”\nwhich causes that MSWord at the next application startup to load this “.wll” executable file.\n(Which also coincides with the TTPs described in the previous post)\n\nThis DLL consists in a packed version of a PoisonIvy RAT sample, that after a few seconds\nmakes traffic to the C2 server “95.179.131.29”, through port 443, and in case of error,\nthrough port 8080 using HTTP traffic.\n\nThe IP address is part of the infrastructure that appears in the post, indicating that it is\nprobably the same actor reusing his old infrastructure in a new campaign, taking advantage\nof the conflict mentioned at the beginning of the article.\n\nIt is always critical to remain alert with any attachments that is related to any recent\ngeopolitical conflict, as previously stated, the attackers usually take advantage of them as a\nmean of infecting their victims through this kind of phishing campaings.\n\n\nDocument\nSHA256\n\nPoison\nIvy\nSHA256\n\nPoison\nIvy\nC2\n\n\n0eb7ba6457367f8f5f917f37ebbf1e7ccf0e971557dbe5d7547e49d129ac0e98\n\n02dec90a18545d4bfbac5de19c6499142e141c3c0abaecdc8ac56b8eede167aa\n\n95.179.131.29\n\n\n-----",
