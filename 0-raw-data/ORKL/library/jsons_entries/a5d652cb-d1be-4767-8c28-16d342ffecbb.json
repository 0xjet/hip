The [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] RCMP seized slightly less than 720 Bitcoins\nfrom the Defendant’s e-wallets and accounts.\"\n\nBesides the 719.99591411 BTC seized from the Desjardins' BTC wallet in January 2021,\n[according to a restraining order filed in January 2022, the police also seized](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21199898-vachon-desjardins-restraining-order)\n15.725489349111 XMR from a Monero wallet, CAD $299,150 from his residence, and over\nCAD $330,000 from several deposit boxes at National Bank of Canada held in his name.\n\nAfter searching his home, law enforcement also seized many devices containing\napproximately 20 TB of data that, \"if printed, would fill an entire hockey arena.\"\n\n## Netwalker ransomware operation sites seized\n\n[On January 27, 2021, when the US DOJ charged Desjardins, law enforcement from the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-charges-netwalker-ransomware-affiliate-seizes-ransom-payments/)\nUSA and Bulgaria also seized dark websites associated with the Netwalker ransomware\noperation, including their Tor payment and data leak sites.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe seizure was the result of a joint investigation conducted by the FBI, the US DOJ, the\nBulgarian National Investigation Service, and Bulgaria's General Directorate Combating\nOrganized Crime.\n\n[Netwalker was a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation that surfaced in late 2019,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/705981/mailto-koko-netwalker-kazkavkovkiz-mailto-readmetxt-support-topic/)\nenlisting affiliates to deploy the ransomware in return for a 60-75% share of all ransom\npayments.\n\nThis ransomware operation was immensely profitable for all the threat actors involved,\nseeing that an August 2020 report estimated that they collected $25 million from victims\nwithin just five months.\n\n[Some of the high-profile victims Netwalker targeted over the years include the Enel Group,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/enel-group-hit-by-ransomware-again-netwalker-demands-14-million/)\n[Equinix, the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/equinix-data-center-giant-hit-by-netwalker-ransomware-45m-ransom/) [University of California San Francisco (UCSF), the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/netwalker-ransomware-continues-assault-on-us-colleges-hits-ucsf/) Argentian immigration\nagency, and [K-Electric.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/netwalker-ransomware-hits-pakistans-largest-private-power-utility/)\n\nHowever, Netwalker affiliates were never picky. They also attacked and attempted to extort\nother private and public organizations, including hospitals, law enforcement organizations,\nemergency services, municipalities, school districts, colleges, and universities.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Canada](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/canada/)\n[Netwalker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/netwalker/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
