So much has changed](http://www.nartv.org/mirror/ghostnet.pdf)\nsince then, both for me personally as well as the research community, the industry and the\nthreat landscape itself.\n\nIt has been a long time since I updated this blog, in fact, the last entry was at the end of\n[2010. The “writing” page has largely been kept up to date with the major papers Iâ€™ve](https://www.nartv.org/writing/)\ncontributed to and I continued publicly blogging from 2011 â€“ 2013 at [Trend Micro and and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/author/nartv/)\nat [FireEye since then. Iâ€™m not really totally sure why I stopped blogging here, but after](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html/category/etc/tags/fireeye-blog-authors/cap-narottama-villeneuve)\nseeing Ron Deibert and some of my old Citizen Lab colleagues the other day — and we\nrealized that it has literally been 10 years since GhostNet â€“ Iâ€™m feeling a bit inspired.\n\n[Ron Deibert covered it in Black Code, but I remember crunching through pcaps with Greg](https://blackcodebook.com/)\nWalton, the ones he collected from the Dalai Lamaâ€™s Office and other locations. We\nspotted all the Enfal stuff quickly and eventually we found the beacons for the malware (we\nprobably should have named it :)) which lead to “GhostNet”.\n\nAfter a little bit of the infamous Google searchingâ€¦\n\n\n-----\n\nâ€¦ all you had to do was visit â€œ/Serverlist.phpâ€� on any of the C2 servers (which were\nobtained from analyzing additional malware samples) and you could see panel.\n\nSoon, [Google (2010) would reveal that it had been compromised in what became known as](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html)\n[Operation Aurora and “APT” and “Cyber Kill Chain” soon become mainstream. There was an](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2018/01/remembering-when-apt-became-lpublic.htm)\nincreasing focus on a lot of cyberespionage groups, and on Comment Crew in particular with\nthe notable releases of McAfee’s [Shady RAT report (2011) and eventually Mandiantâ€™s](https://web.archive.org/web/20110804083836/http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf)\n[blockbuster APT1 report (2013).](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf%20)\n\nProducing public technical papers detailing cyber-espionage activity became a fairly regular\noccurrence. I documented a lot of the research that influenced me during that time frame in\nthese posts:\n\n\n-----\n\n2011 https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/top-apt-research-of2011-that-you-probably-havent-heard-about/\n2012 https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/the-trends-in-targetedattacks-of-2012/\n2013 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/01/trends-in-targeted-attacks2013.html\n\n**Looking Back**\n\nLooking back, I think thereâ€™s some things we got right with GhostNet, but some that\ndefinitely could have been done better.\n\nMy biggest regret is that we should have been crystal clear from the outset that there was no\nâ€œhack backâ€� or anything like that. I spent the next few years trying to clarify what had\nhappened.\n\nI think we did a good job of referencing prior work, in particular the work of Maarten Van\n[Horenbeeck (which had a big impact on me, thanks for the heads-up Oxblood!) and](https://twitter.com/OxbloodRuffin) Mikko\nHyppÃ¶nen and the folks at [F-Secure.](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001406.html)\n\nThere were two analyses of the GhostNet malware that I included in the footnotes of the\nreport, but had to be redacted because the command and control servers were still up (and\ncached in Google) allowing anyone to grab all the victim data:\n\nA case study by Elodie Grandjean\nhttps://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/files/mcafee_security_journal_fall_200\n8.pdf\nA reverse engineering report by Eric Landuyt\n[https://www.datarescue.com/laboratory/trojan2008/index.html](https://www.datarescue.com/laboratory/trojan2008/index.html)\n\nI regret not reaching out to them, as well as others, and working in a more collaborative way\nwith the broader targeted threats research community. I think this would have really helped in\nother areas that I think we could have done better:\n\nMy malware analysis skills were pretty rudimentary at that point (in fact I would still say\nthat Iâ€™m not that good and Iâ€™m learning from the amazing people I work with all\nthe time).\nI should have better understood and explained that there were multiple, separate\nattackers on the same box. Not doing so caused a lot of confusion between what was\nGhostNet and what were clusters of Enfal activity.\nWe could have handled victim notification better. I think being connected to the\nresearch community would have really helped. And we did learn from this, it was great\n[to work with Shadowserver and Steven Adair on the next report.](http://www.nartv.org/mirror/shadows-in-the-cloud.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the areas that I think we focused on, but that did always get the attention it deserved,\nwas the importance of field work. This was our version of incident response engagements.\nGaining an understanding — even if rudimentary — of the context of what happened in a\nparticular incident, what the attackers did post-compromise and why certain data was stolen,\nwhich specific victims were targeted/compromised is extremely important. Greg Waltonâ€™s\nrole here cannot be understated.\n\nFinally, I think we handled attribution in a responsible way. We assessed the data that we\nhad and explored alternative scenarios. We discussed freelancing, third-party actors, tacit\nstate-encouragement and the possibility of false flags. We expressed an element of\nconfidence in our suggestion that the â€œevidence tilts the strongestâ€� toward Chinese\nstate involvement.\n\nLooking back I think the report withstands the test of time.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nOver the years I think there has been a certain level of APT fatigue. The research community\nbroadened and we all began looking at the same things and rushing to publish first (myself\nincluded). There seemed to be a backlash in reaction to these reports ranging from\nâ€œitâ€™s all a bunch of marketingâ€� to â€œitâ€™s always Chinaâ€�.\n\nThen there was the use of the APT label to deflect responsibility when compromises\noccurred. Simultaneously, the distinction between the all powerful APT and the lowly\n“commodity” malware emerged. Iâ€™ve never liked this distinction. Gh0st, PoisonIvy and\nmany other publicly available malware families and utilities have been used by both\ncyberespionage and cybercrime actors of varied skillfulness. The same is true in the modern\nera with the usage of Red Team frameworks (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Powershell Empire)\nas well as a wide variety of RATs. Dismissing whole swaths of activity, is not probably the\nbest security posture.\n\nI’ve only been sporadically researching cyberespionage since about 2016, and I have largely\nfocused on cybercrime. But I have been following the work of a lot of solid researchers, both\nnew and old school, that are continuing to produce amazing research year after year.\n\nTo me, and correct me if I’m wrong, it seems like it’s even harder these days. These are not\nentirely new developments, but dealing with deliberate attempts by threat actors to mislead\non attribution and sorting through the “badtribution” out there present challenges. In addition,\nI think we’ll see more throw away operations where the things we’re used to clustering on,\nlike command and control servers, won’t be re-used thus reducing the hard overlaps\navailable. And the use of large scale distribution that obscures the targeted nature of postcompromise activity — especially when there’s overlap between traditional cybercrime\nactivity with what seems to be more targeted activity — can further complicate the ability to\ntrack and assess the motivations and capabilities of these actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nWell, I ll leave it at that, and hopefully I won t wait years to post again :)\n\n## Post a comment.\n\n\n-----",
