Chen_**\n\nIn November 2019, we [published a blog analyzing an exploit kit we named Capesand that exploited Adobe](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-exploit-kit-capesand-reuses-old-and-new-public-exploits-and-tools-blockchain-ruse/)\nFlash and Microsoft Internet Explorer flaws. During our analysis of the indicators of compromise (IoCs) in\nthe deployed samples that were infecting the victim’s machines, we noticed some interesting characteristics:\nnotably that these samples were making use of obfuscation tools that made them virtually undetectable.\n\nAfter some data collection we found more than 300 samples that correlate to the mentioned indicators that\nwere recently very active our first detections occurred in August, with the campaign itself still ongoing\n(h i i l ik i b ) i i f l h id f ll d bl\n\n\nGo to…\n\n\n-----\n\nbe as stealthy as possible. We decided to name the potential campaign associated with these IoCs as\n“KurdishCoder”, based on the property name of an assembly module found in one of the samples.\n\nWe took a look at one of the samples captured from Capesand that was used to deploy the njRat malware –\nnotably its main executable NotepadEx. We found that were multiple layers of obfuscation using a\ncombination of two tools: the .NET protectors ConfuserEx and Cassandra (CyaX). Both of these tools are\nused in combination to provide an array of fully undetectable capabilities to the deployed njRat malware\nvariant.\n\n**Examining the Capesand samples**\n\nThe simplified diagram taken from the previous blog shows the combination of ConfuserEx and Cassandra\nvia the second layer of obfuscation protection, which involves the DLL CyaX_Sharp Assembly (both\nCyaX_Sharp and CyaX are part of the Cassandra protector).\n\nFigure 1. The infection chain for Capesand that also shows the obfuscation mechanisms\n\nFor this particular sample, CyaX_Sharp is obfuscated with a customized version of ConfuserEx. The\nfollowing image shows an assembly module property that was generated for this sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe module’s property name is “KurdishCoderProducts”, with a value shown to be “ConfuserEx v1.0.0custom”. To understand where this value is coming from, let’s take a look at the open-source ConfuserEx\ntool to see how the values are created. From there, we can establish a hypothesis as to their source.\n\n**A closer look at ConfuserEx’s functions**\n\nWhile ConfuserEx is able to apply multiple transformations to the target binary, we are interested in two\nparticular functions that we can use for correlation:\n\n1. Source code building.\n\n[ConfuserEx is an open-source tool with multiple versions hosted on Github. By examining](https://github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEx) one of the\ncommunity-supported versions, we can see there is a tool to build ConfuserEx from the command line. This\nbuild command line has [a function to update the final binary versions based on the last Git-tagged version.](https://github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEx/blob/master/Build/UpdateVersion.cs)\nHowever, if ConfuserEx is built outside Git, the version update tool will just generate the value “versioncustom” as shown below.\n\nFigure 3. Code taken from a ConfuserEx version created outside GIT\n\nSince the string “ConfuserEx v1.0.0-custom” is present in the module property: [module:\nKurdishCoderProducts(“ConfuserEx v1.0.0-custom”)]”, we can surmise that the version of ConfuserEx that\nwas used for CyaX_Sharp was indeed built outside of Git.\n\n1. Watermarking\n\nWhen ConfuserEx performs its obfuscation routine, one of the operations creates a watermark – a unique\nidentifier within the software–that is present in the final binary. The watermarking technique is implemented\nthrough the module attributes of the assembly. The following source code screenshot shows how this is\nimplemented.\n\nFigure 4. Code showing how the watermarking is performed via the module attributes of the assembly\n\nFrom the previous code section, we can see the default attribute added by ConfuserEx is “ConfusedBy”. If\nwe test it using a sample binary, the following is generated:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Testing a sample binary using ConfuserEx\n\nThere are two important aspects to this attribute: first, it is hardcoded as a string constant and second, its\nvalue is presented in clear text in the final binary as the following image shows.\n\nFigure 6. The default attribute shown in clear text in the final binary\n\nWe now have solid evidence that CyaX_Sharp was obfuscated using a modified version of ConfuserEx,\n\nNext, let’s look for the attribute indicator, starting with the CyaX assembly used in the NotepadEx attack.\n\n**Cassandra Protector: CyaX**\n\nAfter inspection we noticed that this version of CyaX was similarly notable due to two characteristics.\n\nFirst, the debug symbols paths were leaked — suggesting a possible custom build which can be correlated\nwith another modification applied to CyaX.\n\nFigure 7. The leaked debug symbols paths\n\nThe second indicator has to do with one of the methods of CyaX which was modified — specifically the one\ninjecting the binary in memory.\n\nThe following image shows the modified function name.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. The modified method which was renamed to Kirkuk, which is also a name of a city in Iraq\n\n**What other payloads are using KurdishCoder?**\n\nAnalysis of some of the captured samples reveals the different payloads being used (as shown in the table\nbelow). Note that this does not cover all the samples – it is possible that other payloads are being deployed as\nwell.\n\n**KurdishCoderMai** **KurdishCoder_Cya** **CyaX_method_re**\n**Sample** **Payload**\n**nSample** **X_Sharp** **name**\n\nCustomIncreaseX phoenix_keylogger Yes Yes Kirkuk\nNotePadEx Njrat No Yes Kirkuk\nQuickTranslation Agent Tesla Yes Yes Kurd\nSandiwchGenerato\nAgent Tesla Yes Yes Kirkuk\nr\n\n\nSimpleGame Remcos Yes Yes Kirkuk\n\nHawkeye Rebord\nAnimalGames Yes Yes Kurd\nKeylogger\n\nTable 1. The different samples organized name, payload delivered and the fully-undetectable stages where the\n\nattribute “KurdishCoderProduction” is present\n\n**Cassandra Crypter**\n\nWe think one of the possible sources of the customized ConfuserEx is the online service Cassandra Crypter,\nwhich offers two kinds of subscription plans: The Premium Plan and the Private Stub The Premium Plan\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom the service for further personalization.\n\nFigure 9. Cassandra Crypter’s subscription plans\n\nThe combination of ConfuserEx and CyaX (Cassandra protector) seems to be unique and customized based\non the indicators mentioned earlier. While we don’t have definitive evidence that the use of these tools are\npart of a single campaign, we think the analyzed samples are related to a specific campaign. Note that the\nKurdishCoder indicator was spotted also by the Italian Computer Emergency Response Team – Pubblica\nAmministrazione (CERT-PA), which they [reported as a single incident.](https://www.cert-pa.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CERT-PA-B005-190819.pdf)\n\nAs with Capesand, we will be monitoring the use of the tools mentioned in this blog entry for any future\ndevelopments and updates.\n\n**Trend Micro Solutions**\n\nA proactive, multilayered approach to security is key against a wide range of threats— from the gateway,\nendpoints, networks, and servers.
