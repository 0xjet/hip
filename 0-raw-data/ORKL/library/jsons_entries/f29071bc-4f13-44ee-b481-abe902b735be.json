We first discovered its activity in July 2019. Here is our log\n[about it[0]. And ever since then, its sample updates, DDoS attacks and other activities have](https://blog.netlab.360.com/the-botnet-cluster-on-185-244-25-0-24-en/)\nnever stopped.Recently we saw it participated in some very high profile DDoS attacks, we\ngot asked quite a few times in the security community regarding to what botnet is behind the\nattacks, so here is some more details.\n\n## Sample dissemination\n\nMoobot samples are mainly spread through weak telnet passwords and some nday and 0day\n\n[[1][2]vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities we observed using Moobot are as follows:](https://blog.netlab.360.com/multiple-fiber-routers-are-being-compromised-by-botnets-using-0-day/)\n\n**Vulnerability** **Affected Aevice**\n\n[HiSilicon DVR/NVR Backdoor](https://habr.com/en/post/486856/) Firmware for Xiaongmai-based DVRs, NVRs\nand IP cameras\n\n[CVE-2020-8515](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48268) DrayTek Vigor router\n\n\nJAWS Webserver unauthenticated shell\ncommand execution\n\n\nMVPower DVR\n\n\n[LILIN DVR](https://www.meritlilin.com/assets/uploads/support/file/M00158-TW.pdf) LILIN DVRs\n\n[GPON Router RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48225) Netlink GPON Router 1.0.11\n\n[TVT OEM API RCE](https://github.com/mcw0/PoC/blob/master/TVT-PoC.py) TVT Digital Technology Co.

We believe that its author is\nmore inclined to develop and use new methods than to simply change C2. The authors of\nMoobot had made many attempts at the sample binary level & network traffic level.\nGenerally, samples used multiple combinations of the following methods to make job difficult\nfor security researchers.\n\nUse DNS TXT to carry C2/ manually construct DNS TXT request\nPacking with the new UPX magic number\nHidden sensitive resources using encryption method of code table replacement\nUse SOCKS PROXY, TOR PROXY\n\nSince Jan 2020, another variant we called Moobot_xor became active. Moobot_xor doesn't\nadopt mothods metioned above,but just only modified the register message?). Maybe the\nauthor of Moobot has found that only one such simple modification and the constant\nreplacement of C2 is needed to achieve very good benefits during the operation for up to 1\nyear, there is no need to invest in new technology research.\n\n### Sample information\n```\nMD5:98c8326b28163fdaeeb0b056f940ed72\nELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped\nPacker:None\nLib:uclibc\nVerdict: Moobot_xor\n\n```\nMoobot_xor is very close to Mirai, so we are not going to cover things folks already knew. We\nwill only introduce Moobot_xor’s encryption method and the communication protocol,\nunderstanding the encryption method will help extract the bot's configuration information,\nknowing the communication protocol should facility tracking C2 to obtain the attack\ninstructions, we hope that these contents can help the community to better fight the Moobot\nfamily.\n\n### Encryption method\n\n\n-----\n\nMoobot_xor uses Mirai s classic Xor encryption and decryption method, the key is\n```\n0DEADBEEFh,\n\n### Communication protocol\n\n```\nMoobot_xor has made some minor modifications on the basis of the Mirai communication\nprotocol. Let’s look at a few of them here.\n\nRegistration packet\n```\nmsg parsing\n---------------------------------------------------------------33 66 99  -----> hardcoded magic\n06 -----> group string length\n67 6c 61 69 76 65 -----> group string,here it is \"glaive\"\n\n```\nHeartbeat packet\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nmsg parsing\n---------------------------------------------------------------00 00  -----> hardcoded msg from bot\n00 00 -----> hardcoded msg from c2\n\n```\nAttack command\n```\nmsg parsing\n---------------------------------------------------------------similar to Mirai\n01  -----> number of targets\n     77 a7 B5 CB 20  ----->target/mask, 119.167.181.203/32\n02 -----> number of flags\n     00 -----> flag type\n     02 -----> flag length\n     32 30 -----> flag data\n     07 -----> flag type\n     02 -----> flag length\n     38 30 -----> flag data\n\n## Moobot DDoS activity\n\n```\nSince we started tracking Moobot, its attack activity has never stopped. There are only a\nhandful of C2s, but attack targets are all over the world, with about 100 targets per day.\n\n### Moobot's target\n\n\n-----\n\nThe trend of Moobot s daily attack targets is shown in the figure below:：\n\nIt can be seen from the above figure that Moobot's DDoS attack activity has obvious\nanomalies from the end of March 2020 to the beginning of May 2020, and the daily attack\ntarget of Moobot has increased from a few hundred to nearly 20,000. When we took a close\nlook, we found that Moobot's attack target surged because Moobot attacked about 48k of\nBrazilian IP during this period. We don’t know what was reason behind that. After taking\n\n\n-----\n\nBrazil our from the attack targets. Moobot s daily live attack targets are as follows, about 100\nattack targets per day:\n\n### Moobot attack target geographic location distribution\n\n\n-----\n\nMoobot s attack targets are all over the world.The geographical distribution of its attack\ntargets is as follows:\n\n### Moobot attacks the affected domain name\n\nWe were able to confirm that Moobot has been behind some very high profile DDos\n[attacks.We cannot disclose more detail here, but we had a tag cloud in our prior blog here[3].](https://blog.netlab.360.com/the-botnet-cluster-on-185-244-25-0-24-en/)\n\n## Contact us\n\n[Readers are always welcomed to reach us on Twitter, WeChat 360Netlab or email to netlab](https://twitter.com/360Netlab)\nat 360 dot cn.\n\n## IOC\n\n C2\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n190.115.18.238 AS262254|DANCOM_LTD              \nRussian_Federation|Moscow|Unknown\n31.13.195.56  AS34224|Neterra_Ltd.              \nBulgaria|Sofia|Unknown\n37.49.226.216  AS208666|Estro_Web_Services_Private_Limited  \nNetherlands|Overijssel|Enschede\n45.95.168.90  AS42864|Giganet_Internet_Szolgaltato_Kft    Hungary|SzabolcsSzatmar-Bereg_County|Nyiregyhaza\nabcdefg.elrooted.com\naudi.n1gger.com\nbotnetisharam.com\ncykablyat.raiseyourdongers.pw\ndbkjbueuvmf5hh7z.onion\nfrsaxhta.elrooted.com\ngcc.cyberium.cc\nn1gger.com\nnd3rwzslqhxibkl7.onion\nnlocalhost.wordtheminer.com\npark.cyberium.cc\npark.elrooted.com\nproxy.2u0apcm6ylhdy7s.com\nrr442myy7yz4.osrq.xyz\nsisuugde7gzpef2d.onion\ntypicalniggerdayatthecoolaidparty.n1gger.com\nwor.wordtheminer.com\nzrqq.xyz\ntbpsboy.com\n\n```\n\n-----",
