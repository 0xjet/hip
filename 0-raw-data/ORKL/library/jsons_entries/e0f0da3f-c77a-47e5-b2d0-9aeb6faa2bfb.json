The most important thing is\nto always have a reliable and tested backup of your data that you can quickly restore in\ncase of an emergency, like a ransomware attack.\n\nSince Maze is being dropped via exploit kits, you need to make sure that all the latest\nWindows security updates are installed and that all your software is up to date. By doing\nthis you will prevent exploit kits from abusing previously patched vulnerabilities to infect\nyour computer.\n\nGiven that ransomware is also known to be delivered via hacked Remote Desktop services,\nyou should make sure that computers running remote desktop services in your network are\nnot directly connected to the Internet by placing them behind VPNs to only allow access to\ntrusted users.\n\nRunning security software with a built-in behavioral detection engine like Emsisoft AntiMalware and [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is also important when defending your data](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\nagainst ransomware infections.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast, but not least, you also need to follow good online security habits, since, in many\ncases, are the most important measures of all:\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,\nScan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make\nsure you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older\nprograms contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware\ndistributors. Therefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\nIf you are using Remote Desktop Services, do not connect it directly to the Internet.\nInstead make it accessibly only via a VPN.\n\nFor a complete guide on how to protect your computer against ransomware infections, you\n[can read our How to Protect and Harden a Computer against Ransomware article.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-to-protect-and-harden-a-computer-against-ransomware/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hashes:\n```\n91514e6be3f581a77daa79e2a4905dcbdf6bdcc32ee0f713599a94d453a26fc1\n\n File Names:\nDECRYPT-FILES.txt\n\n Network Communication:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n91.218.114.4\n91.218.114.11\n91.218.114.25\n91.218.114.26\n91.218.114.31\n91.218.114.32\n91.218.114.37\n91.218.114.38\n91.218.114.77\n91.218.114.79\n\n```\n[Exploit Kit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/exploit-kit/)\n[Maze](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/maze/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Spelevo Exploit Kit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/spelevo-exploit-kit/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
