Reports of WhisperGate, a multi-staged\nmalicious wiper disguised as ransomware, spread quickly.\n\nWhere [our previous post provided an overview of the threat as a whole, this article goes into more detail on the third and](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/01/threat-thursday-whispergate-wiper)\nfourth stages of the malware. Specifically, we’ll focus on some unexpected and potentially haphazard choices the developers\nmade to hinder reverse engineering and prevent static analysis tools from working as effectively as they could, in order to\nslow analysis and buy more time for the attackers to do their damage.\n\n### WhisperGate: Digging into Stages 3 and 4\n\nAs mentioned in our previous post, Stage three of WhisperGate is a heavily obfuscated C# binary, which is responsible for\ndisabling antivirus software and launching the fourth and final stage payload. The DLL contains the following three\nembedded resources:\n\n78c855a088924e92a7f60d661c3d1845\n7c8cb5598e724d34384cee7402b11f0e\nUnicode<'\\u2005\\u2005\\u2009\\u2008\\u2001\\u2007\\u2009\\u200b\\u200a\\u2005'>\n\nThe first of these resources is an encoded .NET DLL containing the final fourth stage wiper payload. The second resource is\nused to control the code flow, and further obfuscate the intention of the DLL loader. During our analysis, we identified that in\naddition to being a 256-byte array, this resource was initialled as a custom stream object where “getter” functions had been\noverwritten with de-obfuscation functions.\n\nThe third resource initially appears to be unnamed; however, after analysis, it becomes clear that it uses Unicode characters\nto obfuscate itself, much like it does the rest of the binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe resource itself is used by the obfuscation tool Eazfuscator, as part of its string encoder. Each string is resolved using the\ngetter function shown below, which will return the decoded string from a dictionary if it exists. If not, it will decode the string\nand then store it in that dictionary for later retrieval.\n\n_Figure 1 - Eazfuscator's string retrieval function_\n\nThe stage three DLL loader will start off by making sure it has administrator privileges. If it does not, it will attempt to escalate\nitself by running the following command, which will trigger a User Account Control (UAC) dialog. This warning notifies the\nperson using the targeted machine that the program is trying to make changes, which would need to be approved before the\nprogram could progress.\n\n**C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /K Start <filePath> & EXIT**\n\nIf running as Administrator, it will drop and execute a VBScript named “Nmddfrqqrbyjeygggda.vbs” from the Temp directory.\n[The script adds the targeted logical drive to the Windows Defenders list of exclusions, as can be seen below.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/?view=windowsserver2022-ps)\n\n**Powershell - CreateObject(\"\"WScript.Shell\"\").Run \"\"powershell Set-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\\'\"\", 0, False**\n\nThe resource 78c855a088924e92a7f60d661c3d1845 contains a further encoded assembly. The decode function is unusual\nas it uses a combination of RC4 and a simple XOR loop, as shown below.\n\n_Figure 2 - Resource decoding function_\n\nThe function first resolves the following base64 string through Eazfuscator.\n\n\"LKf/VjV6KlpzXaFkzHOLvld5ylJ0zPjQTgiWG1o9rCJ5kQ465LHVFLsit0agXgkz11QXK84TPX621d95bON1QtpnAFEoPgSEag==\"\n\nOnce base64-decoded, the resulting byte array is then passed to another custom encoding function which uses an 8-byte\nkey to XOR decode the array. The key is resolved inside the “GetPemBaseLong” function, which uses TinyCrypt to decrypt\nthe constant.\n\nThis function can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 - Custom array permutating function_\n\nThe result of this function on the input array is shown below, and it is passed into the RC4 key initialization.\n\n_Figure 4 - Final byte array passed into RC4 function_\n\n### Custom Encoding Loop\n\nInstead of relying purely on RC4 to encrypt the resource, the developers decided to build in their own custom encoding loop.\nThis loop uses a combination of their own 8-byte key, and for every 32 bytes of input, they use 1 byte of the RC4 pseudorandom generation algorithm. It’s possible that this was done to hinder reverse engineering by overcomplicating the\ndecryption routine, or to prevent static analysis tools from identifying standard cryptographic functions.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the decoded assembly is dynamically loaded and contains two additional resources named\n“AdvancedRun” and “Waqybg”, both of which are GZip compressed. The DLL loader will first decompress the AdvancedRun\nresource and save the file into the Temp directory as an executable under the same name.\n\n[AdvanceRun.exe is a free tool available through Nirsoft, which allows programs to be run under different settings. In this](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/advanced_run.html)\ncase, two commands are executed through the command line interface and specifically use the “/RunAs 8” flag to execute\nthe commands under the TrustedInstaller group.\n\n[The first command stops the Windows Defender service from using the service control tool, which is located in the System32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-config)\ndirectory.\n\n**/EXEFilename \"\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\sc.exe\"\" /WindowState 0 /CommandLine \"\"stop WinDefend\"\" /StartDirectory**\n**\"\"\"\" /RunAs 8 /Run**\n\nThe second command uses PowerShell and the “rmdir” command to recursively delete all Windows Defender files.\n\n**/EXEFilename \"\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\"\" /WindowState 0 /CommandLine**\n**\"\"rmdir 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender' -Recurse\"\" /StartDirectory \"\"\"\" /RunAs 8 /Run**\n\nAfter removing Windows Defender, the DLL loader moves onto executing the final fourth stage payload. This is stored inside\nthe “Waqybg” resource, which in addition to being GZip encoded, is also in reverse byte order.\n\nThe fourth stage payload is not written to disk; instead, the DLL loader copies a legitimate application named InstallUtill.exe\ninto the Temp directory and starts a process in a suspended state. The malicious code is then injected into the legitimate\nprocess before being restarted.\n\n**Fourth Stage Wiper**\n\n\n-----\n\n[As we mentioned in our previous blog, the fourth stage is designed to overwrite all files that match a hard coded list of file](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/01/threat-thursday-whispergate-wiper)\nextensions. At the core of this functionality is the destructive wiper function, which creates a 1MB buffer of 0xCC bytes that is\nthen written to each file.\n\n[However, as each file is opened using the wfopen() function”wb” mode, its existing contents are discarded. This results in the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-wfopen?view=msvc-170)\ntargeted file being replaced with a 1MB file of 0xCC bytes. It’s not clear if this was the intended design of the malware\ndevelopers or merely an oversight. Regardless, it still functions effectively to wipe the target file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 - Wiper function_\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe developers of the WhisperGate wiper malware have made some unusual and somewhat unexpected choices in their\ncreation of this malware. They implemented their own cryptographic functions that were built on top of standard and proven\nlibraries. They attempted to wipe files in a strange and seemingly slap-dash manner, which may or may not have been\nintentional.\n\nRegardless of this – or maybe even because of it – the WhisperGate wiper malware still has a level of intricacy not typically\nseen among common criminals, which is made especially clear by the lengths the developers went to in order to obfuscate\nthe fourth stage of their creation.\n\nAs we stated [in our last blog, and given the escalating geopolitical events in Ukraine and its surrounding regions, BlackBerry](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/01/threat-thursday-whispergate-wiper)\nstrongly encourages organizations with an elevated risk profile to use the information in this blog to proactively defend\nagainst any malicious activity from this group.\n\n_Check out our latest_ **_demo video here, which shows BlackBerry going head-to-head with a live sample of WhisperGate_**\n_wiper._\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats, providing intelligence analysis for\nthe benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\n\n-----\n\nBack\n\n\n-----",
