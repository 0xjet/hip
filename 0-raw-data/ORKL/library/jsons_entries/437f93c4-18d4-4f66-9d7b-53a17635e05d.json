For the first time we are seeing an Android banking trojan that has screen recording and keylogging as main strategy to\nharvest login credentials in an automated and scalable way. The actors chose to steer away from the common HTML overlay\n\n\n-----\n\nstrategy we usually see in other Android banking Trojans: this approach usually requires more time and effort from the actors in\norder to steal relevant information from the user. Instead, they chose to simply record what is shown on the screen, effectively\nobtaining the same end result.\n\nBased on the intelligence gathered, ThreatFabric was able to obtain the list of apps targeted by Vultur. Italy, Australia and Spain\nwere the countries with most banking institutions targeted. In addition, many crypto-wallets are targeted, which is in line with the\n[trend we observed in our previous blog “The Rage of Android Banking Trojans”.](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/the-rage-of-android-banking-trojans.html)\n\nDuring the investigation ThreatFabric analysts discovered its connection with a well-known dropper framework called Brunhilda,\n[which uses droppers located in Google Play to distribute malware (MITRE T1475).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1475/)\n\nIn this blogpost ThreatFabric will prove that this dropper and Vultur are both developed by the same threat actor group. The choice\nof developing its own private trojan, instead of renting third-party malware, displays a strong motivation from this group, paired\nwith the overall high level of structure and organization present in the bot as well as the server code.\n\n**NOTE : ThreatFabric wants to make clear that both AlphaVNC and ngrok (the third party softwares on which Vultur relies**\n**on to operate) are legitimate and legal products. The developers that created these projects have no control over the**\n**misuse of their software.**\n\n### Context\n\n[In September 2020, Bitdefender published a Bitdefender report about malware droppers found on Google Play. The report states](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/apps-on-google-play-tainted-with-cerberus-banker-malware/)\n[that these droppers were used to distribute Cerberus banking malware. However, we believe that it was in fact Alien banking](https://threatfabric.com/blogs/alien_the_story_of_cerberus_demise.html)\nmalware, the successor of Cerberus, first reported by ThreatFabric in September 2020.\n\nThe droppers on Google Play posed as some utility applications like fitness apps and 2FA authenticators. However, in addition to\nperforming their advertised functionality, they installed banking malware on the victim’s device. Later, in December 2020,\nPRODAFT [revealed more details about the dropper and called it Brunhilda, which at the time of their analysis was also distributing](https://www.prodaft.com/resource/detail/brunhilda-daas-malware-analysis-report)\nAlien banking malware. It was still masquerading as fitness and authentication applications on Google Play. In March 2021,\nThreatFabric’s [CSD detected previously unknown malware with RAT capabilities that we named Vultur. While investigating the](https://threatfabric.com/csd.html)\nnew threat, ThreatFabric analysts were able to connect it with the Brunhilda dropper. In this blog we will cover Vultur and discuss\nthe Brunhilda dropper to show they are connected and operated by a private group using their own dropper to distribute different\nmalware.\n\n## Here comes Vultur\n\nThe vulture is a large bird of prey that specializes in attacking and feeding on weak and helpless animals. These predators keep\ntheir eyes on their preys for a long time before making a move, which happens only when they are sure the attack is lethal and\nsuccessful. Vultur, a new Android banking Trojan discovered by ThreatFabric in March 2021, operates in a very similar way. Just\nlike these big birds, this trojan observes everything that is happening on the devices using a screen recording feature based on\nVNC to obtain all the PII (Personal Identifiable Information) needed to perform fraud, such as banking account username,\npassword and access tokens.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ThreatFabric team was able to find at least 2 dropper applications connected to Vultur, one of them having 5000+ installations\nfrom Google Play. Thus, we estimate the number of potential victims to be in the thousands.\n\n## Capabilities & Commands\n\n### Modus Operandi\n\nVultur approaches banking fraud with a Modus Operandi that is in some way different from what we usually see from Android\nbanking trojans. The usual banking trojan MO heavily relies on abusing the overlay mechanic to trick victims into revealing their\npasswords and other important private information. In an overlay attack, users type their credentials in what they think is a\nlegitimate banking app, effectively giving them to a page controlled by the attacker. Vultur, on the other hand, uses a less\ntechnically flexible yet very effective technique: screen recording.\n\n### Accessibility Services\n\nLike the large majority of banking trojans, Vultur heavily relies on Accessibility Services. When it is first started the malware hides\nits app icon and right after abuses the services to obtain all the necessary permissions to operate properly. It is worth noting that\nthe application requests for Accessibility Service access showing a WebView overlay borrowed from other malware families. In\nfact, the first time we saw this WebView was with Alien banking malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhenever any new event triggers the Accessibility Event service, the bot checks if it is coming from an application that is part of\nthe list of keylogging targets. If so, then it uses the Accessibility Services to log everything typed by the user.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\np y ( y ) {\n  String data;\n  if(!keyLoggerManager.KeyloggerActive) {\n    return;\n  }\n  String v1 = event.getPackageName() == null ? \"Unknown\" : event.getPackageName().toString();\n  if(AcService.keyloggerManager.isPkgKeylogged(v1)) {\n    return;\n  }\n  try {\n    new SimpleDateFormat(\"MM/dd/yyyy, HH:mm:ss z\", Locale.US).format(Calendar.getInstance().getTime());\n    if(!v1.equals(keyLoggerManager.packageName)) {\n      if(keyLoggerManager.dataToBeSent.length() != 0) {\n        keyLoggerManager.formattedData = keyLoggerManager.formattedData + keyLoggerManager.packageName + \" | \" +\nkeyLoggerManager.dataToBeSent + \"\\\\n\";\n      }\n      keyLoggerManager.packageName = v1;\n      keyLoggerManager.dataToBeSent = \"\";\n    }\n    int v12 = event.getEventType();\n    if(v12 == 1) {\n      data = event.getText().toString();\n    }\n    else {\n      if(v12 != 16) {\n        return;\n      }\n      data = event.getText().toString();\n    }\n    if(keyLoggerManager.replaceNumbersFlag) {\n      data = data.replaceAll(\"[^0-9]\", \"\");\n    }\n    if(data.length() != 0) {\n      keyLoggerManager.dataToBeSent = keyLoggerManager.dataToBeSent + data;\n      return;\n    }\n  }\n  catch(Exception v0) {\n    return;\n  }\n}\n\n```\nIn addition to keylogging the services are used to stop the user from deleting the application from the device using the traditional\nprocedures, like going into the settings and manually uninstalling the application. Whenever the user reaches the app details\nscreen, the bot automatically clicks the back button, sending the user to the main settings screen, effectively not allowing access\nto the uninstall button.\n\n### Screen Recording\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter hiding its icon, Vultur proceeds to start its service responsible for managing the main functionality of the trojan, which is\nscreen recording using VNC (Virtual Network Computing). VNC is a specific software implementation, but it is not uncommon for\nmalicious actors to use the term ‘VNC’ to refer to anything falling under the umbrella of Screen Sharing with remote access (may\nthat be done using a third-party software like VNC or TeamViewer, or through Android internal features, used by for example the\nOscorp malware). In the case of Vultur it actually refers to a real VNC implementation taken from AlphaVNC. To provide remote\n[access to the VNC server running on the device, Vultur uses ngrok. ngrok is capable of exposing local servers behind NATs and](https://ngrok.com/)\nfirewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.\n\nIt is obligatory to point out that AlphaVNC and ngrok are legitimate and legal products; however, like many other Android banking\ntrojans, Vultur’s creators had no remorse in abusing them to steal PII from its victims.\n\nThe main VNC-like features are implemented in native code. All the functionalities, like for example the function `nstart_vnc()`\nin the code below, are included in the `libavnc.so library, which is interfaced to the application using a wrapper class.`\n```\npublic static void startVnc(FileDescriptor fileDescriptor, VncSessionConfig config, o arg12, int arg13, int arg14, int\narg15) {\n  C2Commands.log(\"VNC: START VNC SERVICE\");\n  LvWrapper._instance.config = config;\n  LvWrapper._instance.hThread = new HandlerThread(\"nUt\");\n  LvWrapper._instance.hThread.start();\n  LvWrapper._instance.rThread = new HandlerThread(\"rCt\");\n  LvWrapper._instance.rThread.start();\n  LvWrapper._instance.startThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n      String v5 = config.getPw();\n      int v6 = config.getVncPort();\n      C2Commands.log(\"VNC: EXIT CODE = \" + LvWrapper._instance.nstart_vnc(fileDescriptor, arg13, arg14, arg15,\nv5, v6));\n      ((a.a.a.ScreenCapture.a)arg12).a();\n    }\n  });\n  LvWrapper._instance.startThread.start();\n}\n\n```\nThe biggest threat that Vultur offers is its screen recording capability. The trojan uses Accessibility Services to understand what\napplication is in the foreground. If the application is part of the list of targets, it will initiate a screen recording session.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the user pays attention to the notification panel, he would also be able to see that Vultur, in this case masquerading as an app\ncalled “Protection Guard”, is projecting the screen.\n\n## Communication\n\n### C2 Methods\n\nBelow is a complete list of the methods supported by the bot. These are the commands that the bot can send to the C2 to request,\nor to send back, information:\n\n**Method** **Description**\n\nvnc.register Sends registration information\n\nvnc.status Sends device status (is DeviceAdmin, is AccessibilityService enabled, is display on) and VNC address\n\nvnc.apps Sends the list of installed packages\n\nvnc.keylog Sends pressed keys log\n\nvnc.syslog Sends logs\n\ncrash.logs Sends crash logs (logs all the content on the screen via accessibility logging)\n\n### FCM Commands\n\nBelow is a complete list of the commands that the bot can receive via FirebaseCloudMessaging:\n\n**Method** **Description**\n\nregistered Received after successful registration\n\nstart Starts VNC connection using ngrok\n\nstop Stops VNC connection by deleting address, killing the ngrok process and stopping VNC service\n\nunlock Unlocks screen\n\ndelete Uninstalls bot package\n\n\n-----\n\n**Method** **Description**\n\npattern Provides a pattern of gesture/stroke to be executed on the device\n\n### C2 paths\n\nThese are the endpoints reachable on the C2:\n\n**Path** **Description**\n\n/rpc/ Endpoint for C2 communication via JSON-RPC\n\n/upload/ Endpoint for uploading files via POST (e.g. screen record)\n\n/version/app/?filename=ngrok&arch={arm|386} Endpoint for downloading the corresponding ngrok version\n\n## Targets\n\nVultur contains two sets of targets: screen recording and keylogging. The first list reported in the appendix includes all the\napplications that will be victim of screen recording using AlphaVNC, while the second list includes all the applications targeted by\nthe keylogging feature. The following chart shows the number of targeted banking applications per country (applications of\ncryptocurrency wallets and social applications are shown separately):\n\n## Brunhilda\n\nBased on the intelligence gathered through our MTI (Mobile Threat Intelligence) Portal and live detections identified via our CSD\n(Client Side Detection) solution, ThreatFabric was able to link this Vultur campaign with Brunhilda. Brunhilda is a privately\noperated dropper that has been previously observed dropping Alien.A. The sample analyzed in this section was found on the\nGoogle Play Store, but it has been removed at the time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis particular sample has 5.000+ installs, while the overall number victims of Brunhilda group is estimated to be over 30.000\nbased on the Google Play and unofficial application store statistics (some of the droppers have 10.000+ installations). This\ndropper is using the same icon, package name and C2 as a Vultur sample. In addition, ThreatFabric discovered that the\n“Brunhilda Project” C2 is extended with new capabilities to operate Vultur specific bot commands.\n\n### Dropper Functionality\n\nThe dropper apps contain their advertised functionality, meaning the users can use the app as they expect. In the background\nhowever it registers the device to its C2 server, and if the necessary pre-requisites are met, the dropper can download an APK file\nand install it as an update to the current application. This is in line with the fact that ThreatFabric identified Vultur campaigns using\nthe same icon and package name as the dropper. Underneath is the section of code that updates the package with the new APK.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\np () {\n  ((PowerManager)this.getSystemService(\"power\")).newWakeLock(1, \"wl:2\").acquire();\n  this.f(100);\n  b v0 = new b(this);\n  v0.a();\n  while(SPUtils.getState() < 8) {\n    if(SPUtils.getState() < 6) {\n      try {\n        Thread.sleep(500L);\n      }\n      catch(InterruptedException v1) {\n        v1.printStackTrace();\n      }\n      continue;\n    }\n    f0.installPackage();\n    try {\n      Thread.sleep(500L);\n    }\n    catch(InterruptedException v1_1) {\n      v1_1.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    new Thread(h.b).start();\n  }\n  this.stopAll();\n  v0.unregisterReceiver();\n  }\n\n```\nUpon the launch of the application, a registration request is sent to the C2 server using the gRPC framework. The request\ncontains basic information about the device and dropper application that can be used to selectively target specific victims:\npackage name of the dropper, Android version, device model, and OS language.\n\nAs a response it receives an `appToken as a registration ID. This` `appToken is later used in the following requests to identify the`\ndevice. Shortly after registration, the dropper requests for additional configuration and saves in under the `mcfg and` `info:pld`\nfields in SharedPreferences. `info:pld contains the information about the application to be downloaded and installed: package`\nname, size, chunks and XOR key used to decrypt downloaded data. Once the application data has been downloaded and\ndecrypted the installation procedure will be started.\n\n## Comparisons and Connections\n\n### Old vs new Brunhilda\n\nWhen we compare this dropper to one of the previously used samples we see strong similarities between them. Older versions\nuse JSON-RPC instead of gRPC, but the flow and data sent is almost identical:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition we identified code reuse in other places, such as in the code that processes the information on the application to\ndownload, which contained some parameters that were present in both samples but not used in the newer one.\n\n### Brunhilda vs Vultur\n\nOther evidence of the connection between Brunhilda and Vultur is that we saw Vultur using the same C2 as the Brunhilda has\nused in the past. Moreover, Vultur also uses JSON-RPC to communicate with its C2 just like old versions of the dropper:\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe story of Vultur shows again how actors shift from using rented Trojans (MaaS) that are sold on underground markets towards\nproprietary/private malware tailored to the needs of the actor. It enables us to observe a group that covers both processes of\ndistribution and operation of malicious software.\n\nBanking threats on the mobile platform are no longer only based on well-known overlay attacks, but are evolving into RAT-like\nmalware, inheriting useful tricks like detecting foreground applications to start screen recording. This brings the threat to another\nlevel, as such features open the door for on-device fraud, circumventing detection based on phishing MO’s that require fraud to be\nperformed from a new device: With Vultur fraud can happen on the infected device of the victim. These attacks are scalable and\nautomated since the actions to perform fraud can be scripted on the malware backend and sent in the form of sequenced\ncommands.\n\nAs the mobile channels of financial institutions continue to grow, mobile banking malware will only become more popular. Besides\na steep increase in mobile malware volumes targeting banking apps last and this year, we see mobile malware becoming more\nand more sophisticated enabling hard-to-detect large scale attacks. This means that financial institutions should consider\npreparing themselves by better understanding the risk posed to their mobile-first strategy based on the current mobile threat\nlandscape.\n\n## CSD & MTI\n\nThreatFabric makes it easier than it has ever been to run a secure mobile payments business.
