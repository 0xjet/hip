Cybercriminal threat actors distribute these malware to steal sensitive\n**information from infected hosts, which are then sold on underground marketplaces,**\n**exploited for fraud (Business Email Compromise, E-Shop, Bank, Cryptocurrency theft), or**\n**leveraged in “Big Game Hunting” operations.**\n\nMalware developers take advantage of a growing demand for MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service)\nwithin the cybercrime ecosystem to sell their newly implemented or rebranded information\nstealers. They use various underground forums, as well as Telegram channels to advertise,\nmanage financial transactions, and offer technical support. SEKOIA.IO monitor cybercrime\n**forums to discover emerging malware, among other threats.**\n\nIn early September 2022, through our Dark Web monitoring routine we identified a newly\n**advertised malware dubbed BlueFox Stealer v2, and sold as a MaaS. Based on the ads**\npromoting it, the BlueFox developer implemented a stealer tailored to the needs of traffers\nteams (including wide stealing capabilities, performance, efficiency, adapted to traffers\ncontext).\n\nBased on this information, SEKOIA.IO assess that BlueFox Stealer is possibly to be\n**added to the malware arsenal of traffers teams, similarly to Redline, Vidar, Raccoon**\nStealer v2, Aurora Stealer or Erbium Stealer, to be distributed at a large scale. This FLINT\ngoes back to the emergence of BlueFox on cybercrime forums and presents a technical\noverview of it.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The emergence of BlueFox Stealer on forums\n\n### Another stealer designed for traffers teams\n\nBlueFox Stealer’s first version appeared on Russian-speaking underground forums (XSS,\nBHF and DarkNet forums) in December 2021, and it was advertised by a threat actor going\nby the handle distamx. The lack of interactions on its publications may suggest that the\nproject did not work as expected, for unknown reasons.\n\nOn 2 September 2022, the user distamx published a new post announcing version 2 of\nBlueFox Stealer on the XSS forum. This time, the publication resulted in more activity,\nincluding technical and business inquiries, positive feedback, as well as the release and\nchangelogs of multiple updates (versions 2.0.4 to 2.0.7) by the alleged developer.\n\n_Figure 1. Changelog of the BlueFox Stealer version 2.0.7 published on the XSS forum_\n\nTranslated from Russian:\n\n_(…) 7. Added stats for build, which can be viewed without authorization (for traffers). (…)_\nAmong notable changes, the malware developer added an interesting feature to the\nadministration panel of the BlueFox Stealer version 2.0.7 to allow traffers teams to operate\nthe malware builds internally. Thus, traffers teams distributing the BlueFox Stealer have\nstatistics related to each traffer (also named worker) and can give it access – making the\nintegration of the BlueFox Stealer easier into the traffers teams resources. In other words,\neach traffer of the team can monitor statistics related to the distribution of their build on a\nnon-authenticated webpage, and therefore have an assessment of the impact of their work.\n\nSEKOIA.IO observed that efforts towards facilitating the integration of stealers in the traffers\nteams’ activities became common for infostealer developers. A second example is Lumma\n(aka LummaC) Stealer, another emerging malware advertised on Russian-speaking forums\n\n\n-----\n\nand sold as MaaS since August 2022. On 3 October 2022, its author Shamel published an\nupdate intended for the traffers teams, integrating a similar feature to display statistics by\ntraffer.\n\n_Figure 2. Changelog of the LummaC published on the XSS forum_\n\nTranslated from Russian:\n\n_Update 1. Added functionality for teams 2. Added one new widget in the panel – “statistics by_\n_Workers”. (…)_\n\n### A look at distamx’s business\n\nThe business model adopted by distamx is a classic among MaaS operators. The BlueFox\nStealer author sells its malware and the related support services for $350 per month. Based\non feedback and changelogs, distamx is very responsive to bug fixes and feature requests.\n\nOn 7 October 2022, distamx closed the sales of BlueFox Stealer v2, as the threat actor\ngained enough clients for work, according to its statement. We assess that the infostealer is\nunder continuous development and the distamx’s workload is sufficiently high with the\nmalware development and the customer responsiveness. It is therefore plausible that this will\nresult in an increase of BlueFox activities in the near term if MaaS customers distribute it at\nlarge scale.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that distamx also advertised the malware in a Telegram channel\n(t[.]me/distamx_sup) similarly to what other MaaS operators were observed doing. BlueFox’s\npresence on Telegram resulted in scams impersonating distamx to lure potential customers.\nSEKOIA already observed such scams, notably for Mars Stealer, Aurora Botnet, and\nRaccoon. These scams are common in the Russian-speaking cybercrime ecosystem, and\nanalysts monitoring malware-related activities should be aware of this so as not to follow\nfalse leads when investigating threat actors.\n\n## Technical overview of BlueFox Stealer\n\nOnce an emerging malware appears on cybercrime forums, SEKOIA.IO analysts implement\nsearch techniques to retrieve related samples or servers, to produce actionable intelligence\nto our customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malware sample association\n\nA few weeks after the launch of BlueFox Stealer v2, we retrieved BlueFox-related malware\n[samples (SHA256 are available in the IOCs section). Here are the main technical details](https://blog.sekoia.io/bluefox-stealer-a-newcomer-designed-for-traffers-teams/#h-technical-details-iocs)\nallowing SEKOIA to confirm association of these sample to BlueFox stealer with high\nconfidence:\n\n\n**BlueFox Stealer v2 features, as**\n**described in their publications**\n\n\n**SEKOIA.IO’s commentary**\n\n\nUpdate 2.04 to 2.0.7 We observed samples named BlueFox2.0.4,\n_BlueFox2.0.5, BlueFox2.0.7 and BlueFox2.0.8._\n\n\n“Native x86 executable with no\nCRT, running .NET in memory”\n\n\nThe .NET sample has no dependencies.\n\n\n“The size is still about 165 kb.” The stand-alone malware is 162.5KB.\n\n\n“Native protocol on TCP/IP in\nencrypted form”\n\n“Collection … from Chromium,\nEdge and Firefox-based”\n\n“Self-delete executable after\nsending log file.”\n\n\nThe malware communicates over TCP using a\ncustom protocol, and data is encrypted.\n\nThe malware access data from Google Chrome,\nFirefox and Microsoft Edge files.\n\nAnalysed sample deletes itself from the infected host\nusing the command “cmd.exe /C timeout 5 & del”\n\n\n“Collect PC data” The sample reads several Windows Registry keys to\nfingerprint the infected host.\n\n\n“… grabber to search all drives\nand flash drives.”\n\n\nThe malware enumerates physical storage devices.\n\n\nTable 1. Comparative table of BlueFox’s features shared by distamx and the SEKOIA.IO’s\nanalysis\n\n[Discover our CTI and XDR products](https://sekoia.io/en/contact/)\n\nOf note, this is not an exhaustive list, rather a selection of the most characteristic technical\nartifacts deemed relevant in our association process.\n\n### BlueFox Stealer Malware capabilities\n\nThe BlueFox Stealer v2 capabilities advertised by distamx are those of a classic\n**information stealer, with a focus on cryptocurrency wallets, and file grabber and loader**\ncapabilities.\n\nHere is an overview of its capabilities:\n\n\n-----\n\nTargeting of popular browsers (Chromium and Firefox based browsers: Chrome, Edge,\nOpera, Mozilla, etc.) to steal passwords, cookies and autocompletes;\nTargeting of almost all desktop cryptocurrency wallets and extension for cryptocurrency\nwallets (MetaMask, TronLink, BinanceChain, Yoroi, Coinbase, Jaxx, Ethereum,\nElectrum, Exodus,\n\n_etc.);_\nTargeting password extensions (Bitwarden, 1Password);\nFile downloading and loading;\nFile grabbing in all disks;\nScreenshot capturing;\nSystem fingerprinting.\n\nBlueFox exfiltrates the collected data to its C2 server using socket communication via native\nprotocol on TCP/IP in encrypted form. The malware removes itself from the infected host\nusing the Windows command cmd.exe /C timeout 5 & del \"$PATH“.\n\nA dynamic analysis from the Hatching Triage sandbox of a BlueFox Stealer v2 sample is\navailable\n\nhere: [https://tria.ge/221015-2ckbtagec3/behavioral2.](https://tria.ge/221015-2ckbtagec3/behavioral2)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSEKOIA.IO assess that implementing features for monitoring traffers statistics when\ndistributing information-stealing malware is likely to become a must-have to be a relevant\n**player in the cybercrime ecosystem. Based on our observations, such capabilities are**\nalready quite common for prevalent loaders used by Pay-Per-Install services, such as\nSmokeLoader, PrivateLoader, and MixLoader.\n\nTo provide our customers with actionable intelligence, SEKOIA.IO analysts will continue to\nmonitor BlueFox, emerging and prevalent infostealers; and keep an eye on the evolution of\nnewcomers.\n\n## Technical Details & IoCs\n\n### BlueFox IoCs\n\n**BlueFox C2**\n\nThe list of [IoCs is available on SEKOIA github repository.](https://www.sekoia.io/en/resources/glossary/ioc/)\n\nIOC Link\n\n31.41.244[.]152:47567 [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/public/objects/indicator--9732395e-f2ff-44e4-9978-0051c913c8b7)\n\n\n-----\n\n45.8.147[.]200:51425 [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/public/objects/indicator--2b223c2d-c585-431b-9cab-b52bba89b557)\n\n46.148.114[.]177:38990 [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/public/objects/indicator--1fef5d65-e94c-416b-b1c5-95e140eb6794)\n\n45.8.147[.]31:15100 [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/public/objects/indicator--ac39d8a0-47a8-4268-95d6-34a8b3cf0f3a)\n\n193.106.191[.]130:17322 [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/public/objects/indicator--cc4afee7-4324-4982-af48-6b5787f18b43)\n\n91.241.19[.]49:35767 [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/public/objects/indicator--8b1a95e3-5ba8-43a5-ba22-44be904d3f4e)\n\n79.137.198[.]63:42998 [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/public/objects/indicator--be68f637-6a4c-4d35-899c-e9d2817ff32b)\n\n94.131.107[.]223:51176 [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/intelligence/public/objects/indicator--b62d27e7-e796-42d7-bef1-5b5b816207f1)\n\n**BlueFox samples**\n\n**BlueFox2.0.8**\n\n194ef023286a19eea2c084f0d469d3427b97445b0b8fc75888d02274bf01e748\n\n36190e8a9976de1036976ed44456ca833d7d2a7f23ed8acc707efe09fca7da9d\n\nca6d6555b349612637522e8506592ccaa5b0435f2a9af35aab77520cab495439\n\n9ed0f76449bbc6d5d6db12dfc527740c072436c4379248855729321032d91bb7\n\n82ce28407b4f0075d288470410df5af7c28e69ab44144bcf4610e6493e99e478\n\n80bc9d060c42ada4ad5029a196293280d64257db95f223964ce7881930fab0f6\n\n5e14e2582a02b6fe7cb28d6cad80bcddc51be2c01db097b0d292dfd575cb44a9\n\n**BlueFox2.0.7**\n\n7b7714d0bba4aa994d27130165a99d74cf627469f14ad7ba25c51ea0a1e16699\n\nd8ca57e29b21ef3218877f43f9566f2fdbb11552f901d03234e3e9145c862392\n\n**BlueFox2.0.5**\n\nc56a00b4b8ebc12b8798e6ec7ab8e2c9815716fa40bb92488cb3e5c8a227d455\n\n**BlueFox2.0.4**\n\n186f94743c27032ff7401153a52116b4bbbf87c958dd0e2da1c0c111671c0563\n\n### BlueFox Stealer YARA rule\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule infostealer_win_bluefox {\n\n  meta:\n\n    malware = \"BlueFox\"\n\n    description = \"Find BlueFox Stealer v2 samples based on the specific strings\nembed in the executable files\"\n\n    source = \"SEKOIA.IO\"\n\n    reference = \"https://blog.sekoia.io/bluefox-stealer-a-newcomer-designed-fortraffers-teams/\"\n\n    classification = \"TLP:CLEAR\"\n\n  strings:\n\n    $str01 = \"DesktopScreenshotLength\" ascii\n\n    $str02 = \"SoftwareSearchesCount\" ascii\n\n    $str03 = \"AutoCompleteLength\" ascii\n\n    $str04 = \"DesktopSizeLength\" ascii\n\n    $str05 = \"CPULength\" ascii\n\n    $str06 = \"GPUsLength\" ascii\n\n    $str07 = \"FullNameLength\" ascii\n\n    $str08 = \"Asn1NssLength\" ascii\n\n    $str09 = \"LoginLength\" ascii\n\n    $str10 = \"BrowserCount\" ascii\n\n  condition:\n\n    uint16(0)==0x5A4D and 9 of them\n\n}\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK TTPs for BlueFox Stealer\n\n```\n**Tactic** **Technique**\n\nExecution T1059.003 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows\nCommand Shell\n\nDefense Evasion T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nDefense Evasion T1036 – Masquerading\n\nDefense Evasion T1070.004 – Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion\n\nDefense Evasion T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\nCredential Access T1539 – Steal Web Session Cookie\n\nDiscovery T1012 – Query Registry\n\nDiscovery T1082 – System Information Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1083 – File and Directory Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1614 – System Location Discovery\n\n\n-----\n\nCollection T1005 – Data from Local System\n\nCollection T1113 – Screen Capture\n\nCollection T1119 – Automated Collection\n\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\n\nT1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols\n\nT1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer\n\nT1571 – Non-Standard Port\n\n\nExfiltration T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\n## External References\n\n[https://blog.sekoia.io/traffers-a-deep-dive-into-the-information-stealer-ecosystem/](https://blog.sekoia.io/traffers-a-deep-dive-into-the-information-stealer-ecosystem/)\n\n## Chat with our team!\n\nWould you like to know more about our solutions?
