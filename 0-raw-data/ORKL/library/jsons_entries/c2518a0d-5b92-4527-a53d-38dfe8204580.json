    "plain_text": "# Tax Return Customer Campaign Attempts to Infect Victims with Sorillus RAT\n\n**abnormalsecurity.com/blog/tax-customers-sorillus-rat**\n\n[Abnormal Blog](https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog)\nThreat actors are posing as businesses and individuals seeking tax preparation services and\nthen providing copies of the Sorillus client remote access tool (RAT).\n\n[Threat Intel](https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/category/threat-intel)\n\nWith the US tax deadline looming, inboxes everywhere are awash in a sea of\nmessages advising their users to exercise caution and due diligence to prevent\nfraud and identity theft.\n\nIf receiving and downloading files is necessary for business functions, it\nbecomes difficult to avoid downloading a malicious file. Some measure of risk is\nunavoidable, especially if data must be received early in the process of\nestablishing a new client relationship—as is the case for CPAs and tax\npreparation service providers.\n\nThe threat intelligence team at Abnormal Security recently observed a timely\ncampaign targeting accounting and tax professionals.\n\n## Tax Customer Lure\n\n\n-----\n\nBetween February 24, 2022, and March 4, 2022, we identified more than 130\nemails from threat actors posing as potential clients. The emails claimed the\nsender was attempting to locate a CPA ahead of April’s deadline and obtain\nindividual or business tax filing services for this year. However, each email\ndelivered not the promised tax documents but instead an obfuscated version of\nthe remote access tool (RAT) Sorillus.\n\n_Initial contact by bad actors with potential victim_\n\nAfter initial contact with the service provider was made, the actors sent followup messages containing a mega[.]nz file share link to Sorillus RAT. The link was\nhiding underneath the text, pretending to be a simple PDF file attachment.\n\n_Email with “DAVE_AN1040.PDF” text hiding suspicious mega[.]nz file-sharing_\n_link_\n\nEmails were sent from 10 different addresses but were easily identifiable\nbecause the subject lines of the emails followed a similar pattern. Each\nreferenced business and individual tax documents appropriate for the service\nsupposedly being offered.\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\nMega[.]nz was used to send the malicious file as an anti-detection technique,\nand upon visiting the supplied link, a file masquerading as a PDF named\n“DAVE_AN1040.PDF” was downloaded. In reality, though, the file was a .ZIP\narchive containing a .JAR file.\n\n_Malicious .JAR file inside ZIP archive posing as a PDF_\n\nThe .JAR file had two packages, obfuscated with what appears to be the Zelix\nobfuscator.\n\n_Decompiled .JAR file_\n\nEven with the obfuscation, the name of the first package is in clear text,\n_com.sorillus.client. Sorillus is a RAT that runs in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS,_\nas we can see after some deobfuscation.\n\n_Java class identifying different compatible operating systems_\n\nThe tool is able to collect the victim’s system information including hardware ID,\nusername, language, webcam, and OS.\n\n_Java class with the parameters to collect_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen deployed against a victim, Sorillus establishes the connection with its\ncommand and control (C2). In this case, the IP address was 78[.]142[.]18[.]37.\nThe purpose of this C2 connection is to give the threat actor full control of the\nvictim’s operating system.\n\nAccording to [VirusTotal, the C2 IP address is associated with HostSlick, a web](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/78.142.18.37/relations)\nhosting company based in Germany, and has previously been linked to five\nother malicious samples similar to the Sorillus RAT we analyzed. Currently, the\ndomain justinblairinc[.]com, which may be impersonating a US-based\nmanufacturer and distributor of shoe store supplies, is also hosted on this IP\naddress.\n\n_Sorillus RAT connection to C2 IP address_\n\n_Example of network traffic_\n\nOnce the malware has successfully connected to the C2, remote access is\nestablished and the threat actor is able to start stealing information. Stolen\ninformation is encrypted and stored in the victim’s Temp directory until it is\nextracted by the attacker.\n\n_Stolen information stored in the Temp directory_\n\n_Example of encrypted stolen information_\n\n## What Is the Sorillus RAT?\n\n_Sorillus homepage_\n\nSorillus is a paid remote access tool (RAT) that offers obfuscation and\nencryption capabilities. While it was first created in 2019, interest in the tool has\nincreased considerably in the last six months since the previous update.\n\nBeginning on January 18, 2022, different obfuscated client versions of the tool\nstarted to be uploaded to VirusTotal. Sorillus’ features are described in detail on\n[its website. The tool’s creator and distributor, a YouTube user known as “Tapt”,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3G34krDPm79lbq17ARSPyA)\nasserts that the tool is able to collect the following information from its target:\n\nHardwareID\n\nUsername\n\nCountry\n\nLanguage\n\n\n-----\n\nWebcam\n\nHeadless\n\nOperating system\n\nClient Version\n\nActive on YouTube since April 2015, all of Tapt’s recent posts are exclusively\nvideos describing Sorillus RAT and its functions. Overall, their channel has\nreceived almost 75K views, and the timing of their videos is consistent with\nupdates made to the tool.\n\n_Tapt’s YouTube Channel_\n\nThe recently-identified malicious activities associated with this RAT are related\nmainly to information stealing. However, due to Sorillus’ ability to bundle its\nclient code with any other java code, the range of malicious actions the tool can\ntake is broad.\n\n_Screenshot showing three different Sorillus tool interfaces_\n\nThe tool supposedly costs 49.99€ for lifetime access but is currently available at\na discounted 19.99€. Conveniently, the Sorillus can be purchased via a variety\nof cryptocurrencies.\n\n_Payment methods for Sorillus_\n\n## Protecting Yourself From the Sorillus RAT\n\nFor accounting and tax professionals, digital file sharing is a necessity. If you\nprimarily receive documents via email (as opposed to having clients upload\nthem to a secure portal), you must take precautions to reduce your risk of\ndownloading malicious files.\n\nOne simple step is to avoid opening any attachments or links in emails sent\nfrom new or prospective clients until you (or a member of your staff) have\nspoken with the client directly.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n1c7e5f54c879637967ec6937dee9f18afe33a7be71449d4ecdca8c8903e2a97b jar\n\n\n-----\n\n70a8cdbf0aacd885ec30d3c7632cf7fd4f4fe5814504c0dc7da92feb9ee37861 zip\n\n78[.]142[.]18[.]37 C2\n\nililililililiilililili string\n\ndavidans1[@]delveroiin[.]com email\n\nrayjames1101[@]gmail[.]com email\n\ndexatri[.]com domain\n\nbegrino[.]com domain\n\ndelveroiin[.]com domain\n\n## See the Abnormal Solution to the Email Security Problem\n\nProtect your organization from the attacks that matter most with Abnormal\nIntegrated Cloud Email Security.\n\n[See a Demo](https://abnormalsecurity.com/demo)\nExcessive promotional mail, also known as graymail, is impacting productivity\nand employee morale.
