These payloads would then be\nused to provide initial access to threat actors to deploy ransomware, including Ryuk, Conti,\nProLock, Egregor, and many others.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, an international law enforcement action coordinated by Europol\n[and Eurojust took over the Emotet infrastructure and arrested two individuals.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-disrupted-after-global-takedown-operation/)\n\nGerman law enforcement used the infrastructure to deliver an Emotet module\nthat [uninstalled the malware from infected devices on April 25th, 2021.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/europol-emotet-malware-will-uninstall-itself-on-april-25th/)\n\n## Emotet returns after law enforcement operation\n\n[Today, Emotet research group Cryptolaemus,](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1460302706954981385) [GData, and](https://cyber.wtf/2021/11/15/guess-whos-back/) [Advanced Intel have begun to see](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1460308855129313281)\nthe TrickBot malware dropping a loader for Emotet on infected devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is our 3rd anniversary of Cryptolaemus1. Thanks for all the follows and sharing of\nintel these past 3 years! To celebrate, Ivan has released a new version of Emotet\nbecause he feels left out and wants to be part of the party. More details coming soon.\n[As always watch URLHaus pic.twitter.com/Qwvel32ibB](https://t.co/Qwvel32ibB)\n\n[— Cryptolaemus (@Cryptolaemus1) November 15, 2021](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1460302706954981385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nWhile in the past Emotet installed TrickBot, the threat actors are now using a method that\nthe Cryptolaemus group calls \"Operation Reacharound,\" which rebuilds the botnet using\nTrickBot's existing infrastructure\n\n[Emotet expert and Cryptolaemus researcher Joseph Roosen told BleepingComputer that](https://twitter.com/JRoosen)\nthey had not seen any signs of the Emotet botnet performing spamming activity or found any\nmalicious documents dropping the malware.\n\nThis lack of spamming activity is likely due to the rebuilding of the Emotet infrastructure from\nscratch and new reply-chain emails being stolen from victims in future spam campaigns.\n\nCryptolaemus has begun analyzing the new Emotet loader and told BleepingComputer that it\nincludes new changes compared to the previous variants.\n\n\"So far we can definitely confirm that the command buffer has changed. There's now 7\ncommands instead of 3-4. Seems to be various execution options for downloaded binaries\n(since its not just dlls),\" Cryptolaemus researchers told BleepingComputer.\n\nAdvanced Intel's Vitali Kremez has also analyzed the new Emotet dropper and warned that\nthe rebirth of the malware botnet would likely lead to a surge in ransomware infections.\n\n\"It is an early sign of the possible impending Emotet malware activity fueling major\nransomware operations globally given the shortage of the commodity loader ecosystem,\"\nKremez told BleepingComputer in a conversation.\n\"It also tells us that the Emotet takedown did not prevent the adversaries from obtainging the\nmalware builder and setting up the backend system bringing it back to life.\"\n\nSamples of the Emotet loader dropped by TrickBot can be [found at Urlhaus.](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/1789877/)\n\nKremez told BleepingComputer that the current Emotet loader DLL has a compilation\ntimestamp of \"6191769A (Sun Nov 14 20:50:34 2021).\"\n\n## Defending against the new Emotet botnet\n\nMalware tracking non-profit organization Abuse.ch has released a list of command and\ncontrol servers utilized by the new Emotet botnet and strongly suggests network admins\nblock the associated IP addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nFresh, active Emotet botnet C2 servers are now being pushed to Feodo Tracker\n\n[https://t.co/TvIJyqHYVs](https://t.co/TvIJyqHYVs)\n\nWe urge you to *BLOCK* these C2 servers and regularly update your block list to\nreceive the maximum protection!\n\n[https://t.co/if21bBHTpo](https://t.co/if21bBHTpo) [pic.twitter.com/sdySouHxxb](https://t.co/sdySouHxxb)\n\n[— abuse.ch (@abuse_ch) November 15, 2021](https://twitter.com/abuse_ch/status/1460308766767915013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nUnfortunately, the new Emotet infrastructure is growing rapidly, with over 246 infected\ndevices already acting as command and control servers.\n\n[Network administrators are strongly advised to block all associated IP addresses to prevent](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/downloads/ipblocklist_recommended.txt)\ntheir devices from being recruited into the newly reformed Emotet botnet.\n\n_Update 11/16/21: Updated to include source of Operation RA._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Emotet botnet switches to 64-bit modules, increases activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-switches-to-64-bit-modules-increases-activity/)\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Historic Hotel Stay, Complementary Emotet Exposure included](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/historic-hotel-stay-complementary-emotet-exposure-included/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
