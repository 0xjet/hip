Gemini has conducted a more in-depth investigation into\nthese types of attack after a Gemini source provided analysts with the file “sketch_jul31a.ino”,\nwhich was linked to FIN7’s BadUSB attacks. The file had the extension (.INO), indicating it\n[contained the source code for an Arduino “sketch” (the Arduino term for a program).](https://www.arduino.cc/)\n[BleepingComputer also recently released a public report on FIN7’s use of the “BadUSB” attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-hackers-use-badusb-to-target-defense-firms-with-ransomware/)\nmethod, outlining the activity around this type of attack.\n\n[The Arduino platform provides a common set of software utilities and libraries for constructing](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.20/sketch-build-process/)\nprograms to run on platform-compatible microcontrollers. The platform uses a simplified version\nof the C++ programming language and provides foundational libraries, an integrated\ndevelopment environment for constructing the sketch, a compiler, and a means of uploading the\ncompiled sketch to a device with a compatible microcontroller. In the Arduino ecosystem, the\nmicrocontroller executes the compiled sketch, making it operating system (OS) agnostic.\n\nHackers have leveraged the Arduino platform to create trojanized USB devices that emulate\nkeyboards and inject keystrokes. In most cases, the sketches on these trojanized devices\nconnect to a malicious actor’s file repository, download additional software, and install it on the\n\n\n-----\n\n[victim system. In March 2020, security analysts from Trustwave SpiderLabs reported that FIN7](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3534693/cybercriminal-group-mails-malicious-usb-dongles-to-targeted-companies.html)\ntargeted a US company by sending one of its employees a USB device trojanized with keystroke\ninjection malware.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nFIN7 used an Arduino sketch file called “sketch_jul31a.ino” to install malware on USB\ndevices as part of BadUSB attacks.\nFIN7 uses the trojanized USB devices to ultimately load the IceBot Remote Access Trojan\n(RAT), resulting in FIN7 gaining unauthorized remote access to systems within victims’\nnetworks.\nWe identified 9 IP addresses that host FIN7’s malicious payloads and 3 FIN7 commandand-control (C2) servers, one of which contains a control panel for managing infected\nsystems. The control panel displayed a list of systems infected with the IceBot RAT and\npertinent information about each installation.\n\n## Attack Analysis\n\nGemini specialists conducted the analysis of the file “sketch_jul31a.ino”. “.INO” is a file extension\nassociated with the Arduino microcontroller programming platform, while “sketch” is the\nplatform’s term for a program. Malicious actors have taken advantage of the Arduino platform\nand its support for microcontrollers installed on USB devices to install malware. When a USB is\n[maliciously used as a virtual keyboard, the attack is called a “keystroke injection”, “BadUSB”, or](https://www.ociso.ucla.edu/news/fin7-cyber-actors-targeting-us-businesses-through-usb-keystroke-injection-attacks)\n[“Rubber Ducky” attack.](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe)\n\n**_Figure 1: The attack flow of the Fin7 USB attack (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nThis attack’s use of keyboard injection capitalizes on Microsoft Windows’ default behavior of\nautomatically trusting USB keyboards. It uses Arduino-compatible microcontrollers that are\nhidden in what appear to be typical USB devices but are actually programmed to function as\nvirtual keyboards (usually based on ESP8266, Atmega32u4, or ATtiny85 microcontrollers). The\nsketch sends keystrokes to activate a shell and execute additional commands on the victim\nsystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Arduino sketch source code from the file “sketch_jul31a.ino” (Source: Recorded_**\n_Future)_\n\nThe “sketch_jul31a.ino” file (Figure 2) contains the source code for an Arduino sketch designed\nto run scripts on a Windows system. First, the sketch opens the “Run” dialog by sending the\n“Windows” + “R” keys. Next, it sends the keystrokes for “cmd.exe” to the “Run” dialog to execute\na command prompt. The sketch then sends keystrokes to execute “powershell.exe -w h command Invoke-Expression”, which runs the PowerShell interpreter in a hidden window and\nexecutes a script that is passed in-line. This script downloads and installs malware from the IP\naddress 206.54.190[.]230. As shown in the table below, further analysis revealed 8 additional IP\naddresses used to host FIN7’s malicious payload.\n\n**IP Address** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\n\n138.124.180[.]127 2021-07-29 12:26:10 2021-08-10 12:03:34\n\n185.232.170[.]24 2021-07-29 9:21:31 2021-10-21 13:03:42\n\n185.233.80[.]149 2021-07-29 9:50:26 2021-10-21 14:38:00\n\n185.53.46[.]100 2021-07-29 13:47:48 2021-11-20 10:08:13\n\n206.54.191[.]37 2021-07-29 12:37:53 2021-10-21 16:13:58\n\n37.1.213[.]194 2021-07-29 10:48:31 2021-08-10 9:26:01\n\n45.142.215[.]148 2021-10-21 15:17:31 2021-10-21 15:17:31\n\n5.252.177[.]215 2021-07-29 14:18:09 2021-10-21 11:20:57\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3: Contents of the downloaded file wis.txt (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nAfter downloading the file “wis.txt” from the malicious server, the PowerShell script decodes the\nfile via the command “certutil -decode hex”, a command-line program and routine that is part of\nMicrosoft Windows Certificate Services. The decoding results in another PowerShell script,\nsaved to “C:\\windows\\temp\\wis.ps1”.\n\n**_Figure 4: Result of hex-decoding wis.txt into wis.ps1 (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nThis script contains a large block of compressed data, which the script decompresses using the\nPowerShell IO.Compression.DeflateStream routine. The result is a .NET assembly (executable\nmodule), which the script loads into the current execution context through a call to\nReflection.Assembly::Load.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: The function for decoding and decrypting the reflective loader shellcode, rewritten to_**\n_Python. (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nOnce loaded, the .NET assembly decodes a block of data that has been XOR-obfuscated with\nthe key “qawsed1q2w3e”. The result is a reflective loader shellcode that installs the IceBot\nRemote Access Trojan (RAT), previously known as Lizar, Tirion, and Diceloader.\n\n## Remote Access Trojan Analysis\n\nThe RAT executable dropped by “sketch_jul31a.ino” contains 2 command-and-control (C2)\naddresses: 199.80.55[.]66 and 207.246.92[.]213. Analysis of the fingerprints for these 2 IP\naddresses reveals an additional C2 server hosted on IP 185.250.151[.]126, and we were able to\nview the C2 control panel.\n\n**_Figure 6: Hex View snapshot of IceBot showing C2 IP addresses (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7: The main window of the control panel of IceBot version 2.1.1. The IP address of the C2_**\n_server is 185.250.151[.]126:443. (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nThe control panel displays a list of systems infected with the RAT, along with pertinent\ninformation about each installation, such as IP address, OS, process identifier (PID), antivirus\nsoftware, communication history, and next update interval.\n\n**_Figure 8: The list of commands for the control panel of the RAT (Source: Recorded Future)_**\n\nSelecting an infected system and bringing up a context menu allows the threat actor to interact\nwith the RAT and execute commands. As can be seen in Figure 8, several commands are\navailable for managing and accessing information about the infected systems.\n\nThe IOCs for physical and in-memory files used in this attack are depicted in the table below.\n\n**File** **SHA-256**\n\n\n-----\n\nsketch_jul31a.ino f778dccfe13b8597a0a9cbb61a204c03f8e166d7f7d5a21dfcf03d56bd2505c3\n\nwis.ps1 136095f5f529a891eabd8e04693c182f0701716fe051fa04825b5d2e0c85d1ae\n\n.NET assembly 6a3912016f3b41c8cb67a2bc3a6fb2597065d065a809f33288fe838693b7f9a0\n\nShellcode 0a23ad00d0c62dccae0a759ad4853cd514abd176cfa85ba2665e30f7bdc8bcc0\n\nRAT 09189108547ebf046c47f01f4645667e6816a126355ee963d5ad7b91167e4290\n\n## Outlook and Conclusions\n\nThe use of trojanized USB devices for keystroke injection is not a new technique, even for FIN7.\nTypically the attack targets specific persons with access to the computer systems of the intended\nvictim company. As FIN7 has recently ventured into ransomware, it makes sense for them to look\nfor alternative avenues of infecting computers that are monitored by layers of protective systems,\nsuch as firewalls, email scanners, proxy servers, and endpoint security. The tactics and\ntechniques involved in trojanized USB attacks enable FIN7 actors to avoid many of these\nnetwork-level and endpoint protections by dispensing with malware transmission over the\nnetwork, minimizing the use of files on disk and employing multiple layers of encoding of the\nmalware’s scripts and executable code.\n\n[Pertinently, FIN7 recently created “Bastion Secure”, a fake information security company, and](https://geminiadvisory.io/fin7-ransomware-bastion-secure/)\nemployed system administrators to unknowingly assist in system exploitation. It is possible that\ntrojanized USBs are being constructed and used by these administrators for penetration testing.\nAlternatively, they might also be providing trojanized USBs to clients or prospective clients\nthrough some form of ruse (for example, telling the client it contains documentation on the fake\ncompany’s services). In either case, the clients or prospective clients could become victims of a\ntrojanized USB attack, resulting in FIN7 gaining unauthorized remote access to systems within\nvictims’ networks.\n\n**Gemini Advisory Mission Statement**\n\n_Gemini Advisory, a Recorded Future company, provides actionable fraud intelligence to the_\n_largest financial organizations in an effort to mitigate ever-growing cyber risks.
