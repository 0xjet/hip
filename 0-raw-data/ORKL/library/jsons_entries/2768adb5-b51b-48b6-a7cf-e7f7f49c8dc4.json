    "plain_text": "# DDoS Trojans attack Linux\n\n**news.drweb.com/**\n\nDoctor Web\n\n[Back to news](https://news.drweb.com/list/?p=0&lng=en&c=23)\n\n**May 15, 2014**\n\n**The fallacy that Linux is fully protected against malware thanks to the specific**\n**features of its architecture makes life much easier for intruders distributing such**\n**software. In May 2014, Doctor Web's security analysts identified and examined a**\n**record-high number of Trojans for Linux, a large portion of which is designed to**\n**(distributed denial of service) attacks.**\n\nThese programs share common features: first, they carry out DDoS attacks via various\nprotocols, and second, they appear to have been created by the same person, according to\nDoctor Web specialists who have examined all the circumstantial evidence.\n\n[The malicious program that was added to the Dr.Web virus database as Linux.DDoS.3has a](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DDoS.3&lng=en)\nwide array of features. When launched, it determines the address of its command and\ncontrol server (C&C server) and stands by for the parameters of the current task (once the\n[task has been completed, it reports back to the criminals). Linux.DDoS.3 can launch DDoS](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DDoS.3&lng=en)\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks on the specified server over the TCP/IP (TCP flood) and UDP (UDP flood) protocols.\nIt can also send DNS requests to enhance the effectiveness of the attacks (DNS\nAmplification).\n\n[Another modification of the threat, dubbed Linux.DDoS.22, targets Linux ARM distributions,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DDoS.22&lng=en)\n[while Linux.DDoS.24 can infect servers and desktops running 32-bit versions of Ubuntu and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DDoS.24&lng=en)\nCentOS. The Trojan **[Linux.DDoS.24installs in the system as pktmake and modifies the start-](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DDoS.24&lng=en)**\nup scripts so that it will be launched automatically. Once launched, it also collects system\nhardware information, including the CPU type and available memory, and sends it in\nencrypted form to the C&C server belonging to the cybercriminals. The main purpose of this\nmalware is to perform DDoS attacks upon command by the remote host.\n\nAnother group of threats to Linux, studied by Doctor Web's security researchers this month,\n[includes Linux.DnsAmp.1,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.1&lng=en) **[Linux.DnsAmp.2,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.2&lng=en)** **[Linux.DnsAmp.3,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.3&lng=en)** **[Linux.DnsAmp.4 and](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.4&lng=en)**\n**[Linux.DnsAmp.5. Some malware of the Linux.DnsAmp family communicates with two](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.5&lng=en)**\n[control servers and can infect both 32- (Linux.DnsAmp.1,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.1&lng=en) **[Linux.DnsAmp.3,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.3&lng=en)**\n**[Linux.DnsAmp.5) and 64-bit (Linux.DnsAmp.2,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.5&lng=en)** **[Linux.DnsAmp.4 ) versions of Linux. Like](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.4%20&lng=en)**\nother members of this class of DDoS Trojans, **[Linux.DnsAmp modifies the start-up scripts,](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp&lng=en)**\ncollects and sends to the remote server the infected machine’s configuration information (OS\nversion, CPU, amount of free memory and swap file) and then waits for commands. Trojans\nof this family have the following features:\n\nSYN Flood (sending SYN requests to the target node to render it non-responsive).\nUDP flood (the Trojan makes sure that the remote host responds to requests and\nattempts to send 1,000 UDP packets to the target host).\nPing Flood (an ICMP echo request that uses the PID of the process as the identifier\nand 0xA1B0A1B0 as data is dispatched to incapacitate the target).\nDNS Amplification\nNTP Amplification is implemented in various versions of the Trojan but remains\nunused.\n\nAlso upon command by a remote server, **[Linux.DnsAmp can write information into the log](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp&lng=en)**\nfile, repeat the attack or update itself.\n\n[The Trojans Linux.DnsAmp.3(for 32-bit versions of Linux) and Linux.DnsAmp.4(for 64-bit](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.DnsAmp.3&lng=en)\nLinux distributions) are modifications of the first version of Linux.DnsAmp with a limited set of\nfeatures. In fact, these Trojan modifications can perform only three commands from the C&C\nserver: start a DDoS attack, stop the attack and save the log file. It should be noted that\nmany of the malware programs mentioned above connect to the same control servers.\n\nFinally, we need to mention a malicious program for ARM-compatible Linux distributions that\n[has been dubbed Linux.Mrblack. This Trojan is also designed to perform DDoS attacks via](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.Mrblack&lng=en)\nTCP/IP and HTTP. It features a fairly primitive design and, like other similar threats, acts on\ncontrol server commands.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe command servers facilitating control over the Trojans are located mainly in the territory\nof China, and the corresponding DDoS attacks are directed mainly against Chinese\nwebsites. All these malicious applications are detected and removed by Dr.Web Anti-virus for\nLinux and, therefore, pose no danger to systems protected by the application.\n\n[What is the benefit of having an account?](https://www.drweb.com/user/advantages/?lng=en)\n\n## Tell us what you think\n\nTo ask Doctor Web’s site administration about a news item, enter @admin at the beginning\nof your comment.
