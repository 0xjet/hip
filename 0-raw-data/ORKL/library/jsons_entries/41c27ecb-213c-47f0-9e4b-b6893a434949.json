This alert provides\ntechnical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean\ngovernment to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the\nUnited States and globally. Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS and FBI identified\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses associated with a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie,\nused to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.\nThis alert contains indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware descriptions, network\nsignatures, and host-based rules to help network defenders detect activity conducted by the\nNorth Korean government. The U.S. Government refers to the malicious cyber activity by the\nNorth Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information related to HIDDEN\nCOBRA activity, go to [https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.](https://www.us-cert.gov/hiddencobra)\n\nIf users or administrators detect the custom tools indicative of HIDDEN COBRA, these tools\nshould be immediately flagged, reported to the DHS National Cybersecurity Communications\nand Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and given highest\npriority for enhanced mitigation. This alert identifies IP addresses linked to systems infected\nwith DeltaCharlie malware and provides descriptions of the malware and associated malware\nsignatures. DHS and FBI are distributing these IP addresses to enable network defense\nactivities and reduce exposure to the DDoS command-and-control network. FBI has high\nconfidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using the IP addresses for further network\nexploitation.\n\nThis alert includes technical indicators related to specific North Korean government cyber\noperations and provides suggested response actions to those indicators, recommended\nmitigation techniques, and information on reporting incidents to the U.S. Government.\n\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n\n[IOCs (.csv)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TA-17-164A_csv.csv)\n[IOCs (.stix)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TA-17-164A_stix.xml)\n\n\n-----\n\nOn August 23, 2017, DHS published a Malware Analysis Report (MAR-10132963) that\nexamines malware functionality to provide detailed code analysis and insight into specific\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in the malware.\n\nFor a downloadable copy of the MAR, see:\n\n[MAR (.pdf)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10132963.pdf)\n[MAR IOCs (.stix)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10132963_stix.xml)\n\n## Description\n\nSince 2009, HIDDEN COBRA actors have leveraged their capabilities to target and\ncompromise a range of victims; some intrusions have resulted in the exfiltration of data while\nothers have been disruptive in nature. Commercial reporting has referred to this activity as\n[Lazarus Group[1] and Guardians of Peace.[2] DHS and FBI assess that HIDDEN COBRA](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Actor-Lazarus-Group-0bf5e50d24445f94d6b2d744dc6c63a2)\nactors will continue to use cyber operations to advance their government’s military and\nstrategic objectives. Cyber analysts are encouraged to review the information provided in this\nalert to detect signs of malicious network activity.\n\nTools and capabilities used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include DDoS botnets, keyloggers,\nremote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Variants of malware and tools used by\n[HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover,[3] Wild Positron/Duuzer,[4] and Hangman.[5] DHS](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/destover-destructive-malware-has-links-attacks-south-korea)\n[has previously released Alert TA14-353A,[6] which contains additional details on the use of a](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-353A)\nserver message block (SMB) worm tool employed by these actors. Further research is\nneeded to understand the full breadth of this group’s cyber capabilities. In particular, DHS\nrecommends that more research should be conducted on the North Korean cyber activity\nthat has been reported by cybersecurity and threat research firms.\n\nHIDDEN COBRA actors commonly target systems running older, unsupported versions of\nMicrosoft operating systems. The multiple vulnerabilities in these older systems provide\ncyber actors many targets for exploitation. These actors have also used Adobe Flash player\nvulnerabilities to gain initial entry into users’ environments.\n\nHIDDEN COBRA is known to use vulnerabilities affecting various applications. These\nvulnerabilities include:\n\nCVE-2015-6585: Hangul Word Processor Vulnerability\nCVE-2015-8651: Adobe Flash Player 18.0.0.324 and 19.x Vulnerability\nCVE-2016-0034: Microsoft Silverlight 5.1.41212.0 Vulnerability\nCVE-2016-1019: Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.197 Vulnerability\nCVE-2016-4117: Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.226 Vulnerability\n\nDHS recommends that organizations upgrade these applications to the latest version and\npatch level. If Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight is no longer required, DHS recommends\nthat those applications be removed from systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe IOCs provided with this alert include IP addresses determined to be part of the HIDDEN\nCOBRA botnet infrastructure, identified as DeltaCharlie. The DeltaCharlie DDoS bot was\n[originally reported by Novetta in their 2016 Operation Blockbuster Malware Report.[7] This](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Destructive-Malware-Report.pdf)\nmalware has used the IP addresses identified in the accompanying .csv and .stix files as\nboth source and destination IPs. In some instances, the malware may have been present on\nvictims’ networks for a significant period.\n\n**_Technical Details_**\n\nDeltaCharlie is a DDoS tool used by HIDDEN COBRA actors, and is referenced and detailed\nin Novetta’s Operation Blockbuster Destructive Malware report. The information related to\nDeltaCharlie from the Operation Blockbuster Destructive Malware report should be viewed in\nconjunction with the IP addresses listed in the .csv and .stix files provided within this alert.\nDeltaCharlie is a DDoS tool capable of launching Domain Name System (DNS) attacks,\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) attacks, and Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) attacks. The malware\noperates on victims’ systems as a svchost-based service and is capable of downloading\nexecutables, changing its own configuration, updating its own binaries, terminating its own\nprocesses, and activating and terminating denial-of-service attacks. Further details on the\nmalware can be found in Novetta’s report available at the following URL:\n\nhttps://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-BlockbusterDestructive-Malware-Report.pdf\n\n**_Detection and Response_**\n\nHIDDEN COBRA IOCs related to DeltaCharlie are provided within the accompanying .csv\nand .stix files of this alert. DHS and FBI recommend that network administrators review the\nIP addresses, file hashes, network signatures, and YARA rules provided, and add the IPs to\ntheir watchlist to determine whether malicious activity has been observed within their\norganization.\n\nWhen reviewing network perimeter logs for the IP addresses, organizations may find\nnumerous instances of these IP addresses attempting to connect to their systems. Upon\nreviewing the traffic from these IP addresses, system owners may find that some traffic\ncorresponds to malicious activity and some to legitimate activity. System owners are also\nadvised to run the YARA tool on any system they suspect to have been targeted by HIDDEN\nCOBRA actors. Additionally, the appendices of this report provide network signatures to aid\nin the detection and mitigation of HIDDEN COBRA activity.\n\n**_Network Signatures and Host-Based Rules_**\n\nThis section contains network signatures and host-based rules that can be used to detect\nmalicious activity associated with HIDDEN COBRA actors. Although created using a\ncomprehensive vetting process, the possibility of false positives always remains. These\n\n\n-----\n\nsignatures and rules should be used to supplement analysis and should not be used as a\nsole source of attributing this activity to HIDDEN COBRA actors.\n\n**_Network Signatures_**\n\nalert tcp any any -> any any\n(msg:\"DPRK_HIDDEN_COBRA_DDoS_HANDSHAKE_SUCCESS\"; dsize:6;\nflow:established,to_server; content:\"|18 17 e9 e9 e9 e9|\"; fast_pattern:only; sid:1; rev:1;)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"DPRK_HIDDEN_COBRA_Botnet_C2_Host_Beacon\";\nflow:established,to_server; content:\"|1b 17 e9 e9 e9 e9|\"; depth:6; fast_pattern; sid:1; rev:1;)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n**_YARA Rules_**\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\ndescription = “RSA Key”\n\nstrings:\n\n$rsaKey = {7B 4E 1E A7 E9 3F 36 4C DE F4 F0 99 C4 D9 B7 94\n\nA1 FF F2 97 D3 91 13 9D C0 12 02 E4 4C BB 6C 77\n\n48 EE 6F 4B 9B 53 60 98 45 A5 28 65 8A 0B F8 39\n\n73 D7 1A 44 13 B3 6A BB 61 44 AF 31 47 E7 87 C2\n\nAE 7A A7 2C 3A D9 5C 2E 42 1A A6 78 FE 2C AD ED\n\n39 3F FA D0 AD 3D D9 C5 3D 28 EF 3D 67 B1 E0 68\n\n3F 58 A0 19 27 CC 27 C9 E8 D8 1E 7E EE 91 DD 13\n\nB3 47 EF 57 1A CA FF 9A 60 E0 64 08 AA E2 92 D0}\n\ncondition:\n\nany of them\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\ndescription = “DDoS Misspelled Strings”\n\nstrings:\n\n$STR1 = \"Wating\" wide ascii\n\n$STR2 = \"Reamin\" wide ascii\n\n$STR3 = \"laptos\" wide ascii\n\ncondition:\n\n(uint16(0) == 0x5A4D or uint16(0) == 0xCFD0 or uint16(0) == 0xC3D4 or uint32(0) ==\n0x46445025 or uint32(1) == 0x6674725C) and 2 of them\n\n}\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\ndescription = “DDoS Random URL Builder”\n\nstrings:\n\n$randomUrlBuilder = { 83 EC 48 53 55 56 57 8B 3D ?? ?? ?? ?? 33 C0 C7 44 24 28 B4 6F\n41 00 C7 44 24 2C B0 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 30 AC 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 34 A8 6F 41 00 C7 44\n24 38 A4 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 3C A0 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 40 9C 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 44 94 6F\n41 00 C7 44 24 48 8C 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 4C 88 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 50 80 6F 41 00 89 44 24\n54 C7 44 24 10 7C 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 14 78 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 18 74 6F 41 00 C7 44 24\n1C 70 6F 41 00 C7 44 24 20 6C 6F 41 00 89 44 24 24 FF D7 99 B9 0B 00 00 00 F7 F9 8B\n74 94 28 BA 9C 6F 41 00 66 8B 06 66 3B 02 74 34 8B FE 83 C9 FF 33 C0 8B 54 24 60 F2\nAE 8B 6C 24 5C A1 ?? ?? ?? ??

Possible impacts include:\n\ntemporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,\ndisruption to regular operations,\nfinancial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and\npotential harm to an organization’s reputation.\n\n## Solution\n\n**_Mitigation Strategies_**\n\nNetwork administrators are encouraged to apply the following recommendations, which can\nprevent as many as 85 percent of targeted cyber intrusions. The mitigation strategies\nprovided may seem like common sense. However, many organizations fail to use these basic\nsecurity measures, leaving their systems open to compromise:\n\n1. Patch applications and operating systems – Most attackers target vulnerable\n\napplications and operating systems. Ensuring that applications and operating systems\nare patched with the latest updates greatly reduces the number of exploitable entry\npoints available to an attacker. Use best practices when updating software and patches\nby only downloading updates from authenticated vendor sites.\n2. Use application whitelisting – Whitelisting is one of the best security strategies\n\nbecause it allows only specified programs to run while blocking all others, including\nmalicious software.\n3. Restrict administrative privileges – Threat actors are increasingly focused on\n\ngaining control of legitimate credentials, especially credentials associated with highly\nprivileged accounts. Reduce privileges to only those needed for a user’s duties.\nSeparate administrators into privilege tiers with limited access to other tiers.\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Segment networks and segregate them into security zones – Segment networks\n\ninto logical enclaves and restrict host-to-host communications paths. This helps protect\nsensitive information and critical services, and limits damage from network perimeter\nbreaches.\n5. Validate input – Input validation is a method of sanitizing untrusted input provided by\n\nusers of a web application. Implementing input validation can protect against the\nsecurity flaws of web applications by significantly reducing the probability of successful\nexploitation. Types of attacks possibly averted include Structured Query Language\n(SQL) injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection.\n6. Use stringent file reputation settings – Tune the file reputation systems of your anti\nvirus software to the most aggressive setting possible. Some anti-virus products can\nlimit execution to only the highest reputation files, stopping a wide range of\nuntrustworthy code from gaining control.\n7. Understand firewalls – Firewalls provide security to make your network less\n\nsusceptible to attack. They can be configured to block data and applications from\ncertain locations (IP whitelisting), while allowing relevant and necessary data through.\n\n**_Response to Unauthorized Network Access_**\n\n**Enforce your security incident response and business continuity plan. It may take time**\nfor your organization’s IT professionals to isolate and remove threats to your systems and\nrestore normal operations. Meanwhile, you should take steps to maintain your organization’s\nessential functions according to your business continuity plan. Organizations should maintain\nand regularly test backup plans, disaster recovery plans, and business continuity\nprocedures.\n\n**Contact DHS or your local FBI office immediately. To report an intrusion and request**\nresources for incident response or technical assistance, you are encouraged to contact DHS\nNCCIC (NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov or 888-282-0870), the FBI through a local\nfield office, or the FBI’s Cyber Division (CyWatch@fbi.gov or 855-292-3937).\n\n**_Protect Against SQL Injection and Other Attacks on Web Services_**\n\nTo protect against code injections and other attacks, system operators should routinely\nevaluate known and published vulnerabilities, periodically perform software updates and\ntechnology refreshes, and audit external-facing systems for known web application\nvulnerabilities. They should also take the following steps to harden both web applications\nand the servers hosting them to reduce the risk of network intrusion via this vector.\n\nUse and configure available firewalls to block attacks.\nTake steps to secure Windows systems, such as installing and configuring Microsoft’s\nEnhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and Microsoft AppLocker.\nMonitor and remove any unauthorized code present in any www directories.\n\n\n-----\n\nDisable, discontinue, or disallow the use of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)\nand Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as much as possible.\nRemove unnecessary HTTP verbs from web servers. Typical web servers and\napplications only require GET, POST, and HEAD.\nWhere possible, minimize server fingerprinting by configuring web servers to avoid\nresponding with banners identifying the server software and version number.\nSecure both the operating system and the application.\nUpdate and patch production servers regularly.\nDisable potentially harmful SQL-stored procedure calls.\nSanitize and validate input to ensure that it is properly typed and does not contain\nescaped code.\nConsider using type-safe stored procedures and prepared statements.\nAudit transaction logs regularly for suspicious activity.\nPerform penetration testing on web services.\nEnsure error messages are generic and do not expose too much information.\n\n**_Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls_**\n\nSystem operators should take the following steps to limit permissions, privileges, and access\ncontrols.\n\nReduce privileges to only those needed for a user’s duties.\nRestrict users’ ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications,\nand apply the principle of “Least Privilege” to all systems and services. Restricting\nthese privileges may prevent malware from running or limit its capability to spread\nthrough the network.\nCarefully consider the risks before granting administrative rights to users on their own\nmachines.\nScrub and verify all administrator accounts regularly.\nConfigure Group Policy to restrict all users to only one login session, where possible.\nEnforce secure network authentication, where possible.\nInstruct administrators to use non-privileged accounts for standard functions such as\nweb browsing or checking webmail.\nSegment networks into logical enclaves and restrict host-to-host communication paths.\nContainment provided by enclaving also makes incident cleanup significantly less\ncostly.\nConfigure firewalls to disallow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic coming from\noutside of the network boundary, except for in specific configurations such as when\ntunneled through a secondary virtual private network (VPN) with lower privileges.\nAudit existing firewall rules and close all ports that are not explicitly needed for\nbusiness. Specifically, carefully consider which ports should be connecting outbound\nversus inbound.\n\n\n-----\n\nEnforce a strict lockout policy for network users and closely monitor logs for failed login\nactivity. Failed login activity can be indicative of failed intrusion activity.\nIf remote access between zones is an unavoidable business need, log and monitor\nthese connections closely.\nIn environments with a high risk of interception or intrusion, organizations should\nconsider supplementing password authentication with other forms of authentication\nsuch as challenge/response or multifactor authentication using biometric or physical\ntokens.\n\n**_Logging Practices_**\n\nSystem operators should follow these secure logging practices.\n\nEnsure event logging, including applications, events, login activities, and security\nattributes, is turned on or monitored for identification of security issues.\nConfigure network logs to provide adequate information to assist in quickly developing\nan accurate determination of a security incident.\nUpgrade PowerShell to new versions with enhanced logging features and monitor the\nlogs to detect usage of PowerShell commands, which are often malware-related.\nSecure logs in a centralized location and protect them from modification.\nPrepare an incident response plan that can be rapidly administered in case of a cyber\nintrusion.\n\n## References\n\n Revisions\n\nJune 13, 2017: Initial Release\n\nAugust 23, 2017: Updated YARA Rules and included MAR-10132963 (.pdf and .stix files)\n\n[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this](https://www.us-cert.gov/privacy/notification) [Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n**Please share your thoughts.**\n\n[We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-164A)\n\n\n-----",
