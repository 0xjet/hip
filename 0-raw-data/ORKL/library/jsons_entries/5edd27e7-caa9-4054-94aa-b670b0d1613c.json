The FBI arrested\n[Huddlestone in early 2017, and Huddleston pleaded guilty in July last year.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/author-of-nanocore-rat-pleads-guilty-in-court/)\n\nHuddleston's case is unique because he was the first case where the author of a malware\nstrain was arrested, despite not being accused of using the malware himself. In the\nmeantime, the US government is pursuing a similar case against Marcus \"MalwareTech\"\nHutchins, the security researcher who helped stop the WannaCry ransomware outbreak,\naccusing him of creating the Kronos banking trojan.\n\n## Huddleston never intended to become a malware author\n\n[According to Huddleston's position on sentencing and a](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4387420-Huddleston-POSITION-on-SENTENCING.html) [statement of facts, the suspect said](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3901131-Huddleston-Statement-of-Facts.html)\nhe did not start out his life as a software engineer with any malicious intent.\n\nInstead, he got into software as a way to sustain himself as a teenager who lived in shabby\nconditions, never met his biological father, and moved countless of times during his youth.\n\n\n-----\n\nHuddleston s first major application wasn t even malicious. Called Net Seal, this was a\nprogram that could be used to secure applications against software piracy. Net Seal was\nused with many types of applications, but it became incredibly popular with hackers, who\nused it to secure malware they put up for sale against scammers and crackers.\n\nBecause of his success on the malware scene, and especially Net Seal's popularity on a\nhacking forum known as HackForums, Huddleston began actively marketing Net Seal on that\nparticular forum in the hopes of boosting revenue.\n\n## Huddleston also created the Nanocore RAT\n\nBut as his ties to the cybercrime world deepened, so did his morals. Two years after starting\nto advertise Net Seal on HackForums, Huddleston created Nanocore, which he described\nand advertised on the same forum as a \"remote access tool ... designed to allow a computer\nhacker to take complete control of a victim’s computer for the purpose of performing\" remote\noperations.\n\nHuddleston advertised and sold the Nanocore RAT on HackForums under the nickname of\nAeonhack from January 2014 to February 2016, when he sold both Net Seal and Nanocore\nto an unidentified third-party.\n\nIn his guilty plea, Huddleston admitted to knowing that some of his customers used\nNanocore for malicious purposes. Before pleading guilty, Huddleston's lawyer tried to argue\n[that in many of reported Nanocore infections [1,](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-use-discord-voip-chat-servers-host-nanocore-njrat-spyrat) [2,](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/indian-us-uk-finance-department-employees-targeted-remote-access-trojans) [3], Huddleston wasn't even aware of the](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/teaching-an-old-rat-new-tricks/)\nattacks and that some malware distributors used cracked versions of his RAT.\n\nMr. Huddleston understands and accepts that he broke the law by marketing Net Seal and\nNanoCore on a website frequented by users who would likely use the programs for malicious\npurposes. [...] Mr. Huddleston knows that he has no one to blame but himself, and is\nprepared to serve the sentence this Court finds appropriate. His actions before and after his\narrest illustrate his sincere remorse and dedication to using his talents to benefit society and\nmake amends for his illegal conduct.\n\nHuddleston now works as a carpenter, his lawyers told the court before last week's\nsentencing. He also \"enthusiastically\" cooperated with authorities, his lawyers pointed out.\n\nThey asked for a maximum sentence of six months in prison. He faced a maximum prison\nsentence of ten years, but the court decided on 33 months instead.\n\n[The FBI tracked down Huddleston during their investigation of Zachary Shames, the author](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/author-of-limitless-keylogger-faces-up-to-10-years-in-prison/)\nof the Limitless Keylogger.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New stealthy Nerbian RAT malware spotted in ongoing attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-nerbian-rat-malware-spotted-in-ongoing-attacks/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New NetDooka malware spreads via poisoned search results](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-netdooka-malware-spreads-via-poisoned-search-results/)\n\n[New ChromeLoader malware surge threatens browsers worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chromeloader-malware-surge-threatens-browsers-worldwide/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[Popular Python and PHP libraries hijacked to steal AWS keys](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-python-and-php-libraries-hijacked-to-steal-aws-keys/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a few\nmore.
