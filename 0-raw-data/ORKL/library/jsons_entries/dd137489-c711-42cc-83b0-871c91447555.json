Data sources included the Recorded Future® Platform, ReversingLabs,_\n_VirusTotal, Shodan, BinaryEdge, and various OSINT tools. The target audience for this_\n_research includes security practitioners, network defenders, and threat intelligence_\n_professionals who are interested in Russian nation-state computer network operations_\n_activity._\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n[Turla, also known as Snake, Waterbug, and Venomous Bear, is a well-](https://www.baesystems.com/en/cybersecurity/feature/the-snake-campaign)\nestablished, sophisticated, and strategically focused cyberespionage\ngroup that has for over a decade been linked to operations against\nresearch, diplomatic, and military organizations worldwide, with\nan ongoing focus against entities within North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and Commonwealth of Independent States\n(CIS) nations in particular.\n\nWhile many nation-state threat actor groups are becoming more\nreliant on open source and commodity software for operations,\nTurla continues to develop its own unique, advanced malware and\ntools and adopts new methods of attack and obfuscation. It uses\nthese TTPs alongside older techniques and generic, open source\ntools. For these reasons, Insikt Group assesses that Turla Group\nwill remain an active, advanced threat for years to come that will\ncontinue to surprise with unique operational concepts.\n\nHowever, the group’s consistent patterns and use of stable and\nperiodically updated versions of unique malware for lengthy\ncampaigns may allow defenders to proactively track and identify\nTurla’s infrastructure and activities. This research examines the\nhistory of Turla’s operations and provides our methodology for\nidentifying infrastructure currently being used by Turla, focusing\non several Turla-associated malware types. Details on two of them\n— the composite Mosquito backdoor and the hijacked Iranian\nTwoFace ASPX web shell — are provided in this report.\n\nRecorded Future has provided a detailed report to our clients with\nfurther research and detections for additional Turla-related malware\nfamilies, which is available in the Recorded Future platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Key Judgments\n\n - Turla Group can be tracked based on unique features of their\n\nmalware and C2 communication. Additionally, Turla’s use of\nopen source tools when avoiding detection and confusing\nattribution attempts also allows researchers to quickly analyze\nand build detections, as the source code is readily available\nfor analysis and testing.\n\n - In June 2019, Turla Group was found to have infiltrated the\n\ncomputer network operations infrastructure of APT34, an\nIranian threat group. This amounted to the effective takeover\nof the computer network operations of a nation-state group\nby state actors from another country — an unprecedented\naction. Insikt Group assesses that Turla Group’s use of APT34\ninfrastructure was primarily opportunistic in nature and was\nnot coordinated between Iranian and Russian organizations.\n\n - Recorded Future assesses with high confidence that TwoFace\n\nis the Iranian APT34 ASPX shell Turla was scanning for to pivot\nto additional hosts, as documented in the NSA/NCSC report.\nWe assess that any live TwoFace shells as of late January 2020\ncould also be potential operational assets of the Turla Group.\n\n - In 2019, Turla began relying heavily on PowerShell scripts for\n\nmalware installation. Previously, it had also heavily targeted\nMicrosoft vulnerabilities as well as email servers. Turla\nalso often uses compromised WordPress websites as the\nfoundation of its C2 infrastructure.\n\n - Among the malware that we researched, Turla mainly uses\n\nHTTP/S for their command and control (C2) communication.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Background\n\nTurla has been attributed to operations targeting the Pentagon\nas early as 2008 and has continued targeting NATO nations to the\npresent day. Primary targets of Turla include publishing and media\n[companies, universities/academia, and government organizations,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eset-Turla-Outlook-Backdoor.pdf)\noften specifically targeting scientific and energy research, remote\nand local diplomatic affairs, and military data. Turla actively targets\nEuropean and [CIS countries, historically focusing on ministries](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations/turla)\nof foreign affairs or defense, as well as similar government\norganizations and affiliated research institutions.\n\nTurla is known for its use of watering hole attacks (compromising\nwebsites to target visitors) and spearphishing campaigns to precisely\nattack specific entities of interest. Turla has also used inventive, outof-the box techniques, including using satellites to exfiltrate data\nfrom remote areas in North Africa and the Middle East. The group\nis known for the use of both unaltered and customized versions of\nopen source software such as Meterpreter and Mimikatz, as well as\nbespoke malware such as Gazer, IcedCoffee, Carbon, and Mosquito.\n\nTurla operators have also commandeered third-party infrastructure\nor used false flags in order to further their purposes. In many cases,\nthis group has used compromised websites (typically WordPress\nsites) as both an infection vector and as operational infrastructure\nfor C2 communications.\n\nIn June 2019, Turla was identified by researchers at Symantec as\n[having infiltrated the computer network operations infrastructure](https://symantec-blogs.broadcom.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments)\n[of APT34, an Iranian threat group, collecting and exfiltrating Iranian](https://symantec-blogs.broadcom.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments)\noperational information, and simultaneously gaining access to\nactive victims of the Iranians.\n\nTurla’s hijacking of Iranian APT34 operations in part consisted of\nscanning for and discovering their web shells using existing APT34\nvictim networks to scan for a specific web shell on IP addresses\nacross at least 35 different countries. Once identified, Turla used\nthese shells to gain an initial foothold into victims of interest and\nthen deployed further tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n[TwoFace, first observed in 2015, is the primary APT34 web shell, and](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-summit/archives/file/summit-archive-1574947864.pdf)\nRecorded Future assesses with high confidence that TwoFace is the\nshell Turla was scanning for to pivot to additional hosts. We assess\nthat any live TwoFace shells as of late January 2020 could also be\npotential operational assets of the Turla Group.\n\nTurla also directly accessed C2 panels of the APT34 Poison Frog tool\nfrom their own infrastructure and used this access to task victims\nwith downloading Turla tools.\n\n#### Threat Analysis\n\nTo date, Turla Group’s hijacking of Iranian computer network\noperations resources has been unique among known threat actors;\nthis action amounted to the effective takeover of the computer\nnetwork operations of a nation-state group by state actors from\nanother country.\n\nAlthough it is possible that the Iranian and Russian organizations\nwere cooperating in some manner, the evidence available to Insikt\nGroup does not support this theory. For example, while Turla had\nsignificant insight into APT34 tools and operations, they were\nrequired to scan for Iranian web shells in order to find where\nthese tools were deployed. We assess that Turla’s interposition into\nIranian operations was likely an uncoordinated, and thus hostile,\nact.\n\nWhile Insikt Group assesses that Turla Group’s use of APT34\ninfrastructure was primarily opportunistic in nature, an added\nbenefit for the operators was likely the deception of incident\nresponders who would potentially identify the tools as Iranian in\norigin. Turla has reused malware from other threat actors prior to\n[their use of Iranian tools, including the use of Chinese-attributed](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2017/10/20114955/Bartholomew-GuerreroSaade-VB2016.pdf)\n[Quarian malware in 2012. In that instance, Kaspersky researchers](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2017/10/20114955/Bartholomew-GuerreroSaade-VB2016.pdf)\nassessed that Turla actors downloaded, then uninstalled, the\nQuarian malware in an attempt to divert and deceive incident\nresponders post-discovery.\n\n\n-----\n\nOutside of their bold Iranian venture, Turla has concurrently\nconducted other operational and development activities. In 2019,\nTurla started heavily using PowerShell scripts, likely in an effort to\navoid discovery of malicious files on disk. Over the course of the\nyear, they have [increased their use of PowerShell scripts, using](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/29/turla-powershell-usage/)\nPowerSploit and [PowerShell Empire, as well as developing their](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/)\nown Powershell backdoor, PowerStallion.\n\nWhile Turla most often targets Microsoft Windows operating systems,\nthey have also purposely exploited email servers. The LightNeuron\n[backdoor is specifically designed to function on Microsoft Exchange](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/07/turla-lightneuron-email-too-far/)\n[mail servers, and the Outlook backdoor is designed to operate on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/07/turla-lightneuron-email-too-far/)\n[Exchange and The Bat! (popular in Eastern Europe) email servers.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Eset-Turla-Outlook-Backdoor.pdf)\nCompromising mail servers provides Turla control of email traffic\non a target network, including the ability to not only monitor email,\nbut create, send, and even block email.\n\n[Turla relies on compromised WordPress sites as C2s. They also have](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/trojan-variants/kazuar)\n[regularly used WordPress-focused URL names for payload delivery](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/)\n[since 2014 and possibly earlier. This tendency enables the profiling](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/)\nof their C2s and payload URLs to discover new Turla infrastructure.\n\nTurla operations have been associated with a variety of custom\nmalware. Insikt Group performed deeper analysis on several of\nthese malware types in an effort to create scanning rules to detect\nlive Turla-associated infrastructure active from December 2019 to\nJanuary 2020.\n\n#### Turla Advanced Detection Analysis\n\nThe focus of our analysis was the development of identification\nmethods for Turla, focusing on several Turla-associated malware\ntypes. Details of our analysis of both the composite Mosquito\nbackdoor and the hijacked Iranian TwoFace web shell are provided\nin this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mosquito Controller Detection**\n\nIn January 2018, [ESET reported on a newer backdoor named](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf)\nMosquito that they observed Turla using during intrusion analysis.\nThere were multiple components to the Mosquito delivery and\ninstallation, such as:\n\n - Use of a trojanized Adobe installer\n\n - Use of Metasploit shellcode to download a legitimate copy of\n\nthe Adobe Flash installer and a copy of Meterpreter in order\nto enable the download and installation of the\nMosquito installer\n\n - Installer with encrypted payload\n\n - Launcher which executes the primary backdoor, “Commander”\n\n[Mosquito is a Win32 remote access trojan (RAT). The malware](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/)\nincludes three primary components: an installer, launcher, and\nthe backdoor component sometimes called CommanderDLL.\nThe Mosquito malware has been [dropped after the initial use of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/)\n[Metasploit shellcode and installation of Meterpreter to gain control](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/)\nof the victim. It has the following capabilities:\n\n - Download file\n\n - Create process\n\n - Delete file\n\n - Upload file\n\n - Execute shell commands\n\n - Execute PowerShell commands\n\n - Add C2 server\n\n - Delete C2 server\n\nCommander is the main component of the Mosquito backdoor.\nIn this research, we focused our analysis primarily on the C2\ncommunication of Commander. For details on the other aspects\nof the Mosquito package, a thorough analysis was conducted by\n[researchers at ESET.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nESET’s analysis of the communication from Commander to its C2\nshows that communication to and from the controller is sent via\nHTTP or HTTPS. On the client side, data can be sent as a parameter\nin the GET request, as a cookie, or as the parameter and payload\nof a POST (as shown in the image below). On the controller side,\nresponses and commands are sent as an HTTP payload.\n\n_Beacon from the Mosquito \"Commander\" backdoor with encrypted data sent in the POST parameter and payload._\n\nAs shown above, the data sent to the controller is not in clear text. It\n[is first protected with an encryption routine that uses a Blum Blum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum_Blum_Shub)\n[Shub pseudo-random number generator to create a stream of bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum_Blum_Shub)\nthat are used to XOR encode the cleartext data. The resulting data\nis then Base64 encoded.\n\nTo encrypt or decrypt, a key and modulus are required by the\nencryption process. As ESET reported, and as Insikt Group observed\nduring its analysis, the modulus of \"0x7DFDC101\" is hardcoded.\nThe key is not hardcoded and is randomly generated at each\nexchange between the client and controller so the key is different\nfor each transmission. This randomized key is sent as a part of\nthe C2 communication and can be easily extracted. Insikt Group\nanalysts have reversed this pseudo-random number generator\nimplementation and have created a decoder script in Python that\n[can be found in our GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research)\n\n\n-----\n\nMirroring analysis from ESET, Insikt Group found there is header\ninformation prepended to the data being sent. The header, when\ndecrypted, consists of the following fields:\n\n**Fields** **Length** **Description**\n\nStarting Key DWORD Starting key used to decrypt the data\n\nValue that indicates different methods used for\n\nC2 Communication. Available IDs include 0x85\n\nID BYTE (HTTP Get with possible Custom Headers), 0x87\n\n(HTTP POST Transmission), 0x88 (HTTP GET with\n\nCookie), and 0x89 (HTTP GET)\n\nString Length BYTE Length of string field\n\nTwo hex BYTES that represent a ASCII Decimal\n\nString Variable 1-4 BYTES Number representation. 0x37,0x32 (HEX) == 72\n\n(Decimal) == H (ASCI)I\n\nMAC Address QWORD MAC address of host\n\nNULL DWORD No value\n\nData Length DWORD Length of data segment within URL\n\nContains a 28 BYTE header and then the data;\n\ndata is also Blum Blum Shub encrypted using\n\nData (URL) Variable the hardcoded key, 0x3EB13; we have observed\n\nthat when data is sent as a POST that this field\n\ncontains junk values\n\nData sent as a POST does not contain a header\n\nlike the URL method; as with the URL method,\n\nData (POST) Variable\n\ndata is Blum Blum Shub encrypted using the\n\nhardcoded key, 0x3EB13\n\n_Decrypted Mosquito Commander header information._\n\nFurther analysis of the Commander backdoor shows that the\nresponse expected from the controller is an HTTP/S packet in which\nthe payload is Base64 encoded and then encrypted in the same way\nas the C2 beacon packet. If the response is successfully decoded,\nthe first byte is checked, and if it is equal to 28, then the remaining\nbytes of data are parsed. If the first byte is equal to 0x27, then\nnothing else is done with the C2 response.\n\n|Fields|Length|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|Starting Key ID|DWORD BYTE|Starting key used to decrypt the data Value that indicates different methods used for C2 Communication. Available IDs include 0x85 (HTTP Get with possible Custom Headers), 0x87 (HTTP POST Transmission), 0x88 (HTTP GET with Cookie), and 0x89 (HTTP GET)|\n|String Length String|BYTE Variable 1-4 BYTES|Length of string field Two hex BYTES that represent a ASCII Decimal Number representation. 0x37,0x32 (HEX) == 72 (Decimal) == H (ASCI)I|\n|MAC Address NULL|QWORD DWORD|MAC address of host No value|\n|Data Length Data (URL)|DWORD Variable|Length of data segment within URL Contains a 28 BYTE header and then the data; data is also Blum Blum Shub encrypted using the hardcoded key, 0x3EB13; we have observed that when data is sent as a POST that this field contains junk values|\n|Data (POST)|Variable|Data sent as a POST does not contain a header like the URL method; as with the URL method, data is Blum Blum Shub encrypted using the hardcoded key, 0x3EB13|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mosquito Commander C2 response-handling code._\n\n**Commander Passive Scans**\n\nUsing open source tools like [urlscan.io, as well as proprietary](https://urlscan.io/)\nscanning methodologies developed by Insikt Group, the passive\nscans look for evidence of compromised hosts beaconing back to\nthe controller. The queries search for the static aspects of the GET or\nPOST resource string \"/scripts/m/query.php?id=\" as demonstrated\nin the link below:\n\n - [https://urlscan.io/search/#%22%2Fscripts%2Fm%2Fquery.](https://urlscan.io/search/#%22%2Fscripts%2Fm%2Fquery.php%22)\n\n[php%22](https://urlscan.io/search/#%22%2Fscripts%2Fm%2Fquery.php%22)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Examples of recent results from this query with urlscan.io include:](https://urlscan.io/)\n\n**• 204.193.62.62/scripts/m/query.**\n\nphp?id=eQV0AKBGOorB%2FsB6ZkIU0e%2BKQO…\n\n**• 204.193.62.62/scripts/m/query.php?id=eQV0AKBGOorB/**\n\nsB6ZkIU0e+KQOWiwulq…\n\n**• 77.232.99.77/scripts/m/query.**\n\nphp?id=eQV0AKBGOorB%2FsB6ZkIU0e%2BKQ...\n\nThe URLs above match the typical Mosquito URL pattern\nperfectly. Using our Python decoder script mentioned above,\nwe can attempt to decode the encrypted portion of the URL,\n“eQV0AKBGOorB%2FsB6ZkIU0e%2BKQO…” The results of our script\nare shown below.\n\n_Decrypted urlscan.io Commander URL string._\n\nAfter running the decode script, we can determine that the beginning\nof the header is decoded correctly since we are able to extract the\nID, string values, and MAC address of the compromised device. For\nboth IPs, the data section cannot be decoded, but this is expected,\nconsidering that the ID is 0x87, which indicates that this was a HTTP\nPOST and the actual data we would want to decode is in the HTTP\npayload and not in the parameter. Based on this analysis, we assess\nwith medium confidence that these IPs are Mosquito Controllers.\n\n**TwoFace Web Shell Detection**\n\nThe TwoFace web shell was first discovered and analyzed by the\n[Palo Alto Unit42 research team and later attributed to the group](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-twoface-webshell-persistent-access-point-lateral-movement/)\nthey associate as OilRig, which is commonly associated with APT34.\nAs stated earlier, Turla scanned for the presence of the TwoFace\nASPX web shells, and then attempted to access and download Snake\nor other malware. We believe that many of these web shells may\nnow be operational assets of Turla and no longer in the control of\nAPT34.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe TwoFace web shell is actually two shells: an initial loader shell,\nand a second, fully functional web shell that gives the operator\nmuch more control of the website. Both components were written\nin C# and designed to function on web servers supporting ASP.NET,\nusing Active Server Page Extended (ASPX) files to operate. TwoFace\nis a remote access trojan with the following capabilities:\n\n - Execute program\n\n - Execute shell command\n\n - Upload file\n\n - Modify file\n\n - Delete file\n\n - Download file\n\n - Timestomping (modification of file timestamps)\n\nAccessing the web shell is done through a control panel\nsimilar to the image below. The threat actors would then have to\nauthenticate in order to perform additional actions. However, even\nwithout authentication, the presence of this specific .aspx file is\ndetermination enough of the presence of the TwoFace web shell.\n\n_TwoFace web shell panel._\n\n\n-----\n\n**TwoFace Web Shell Discovery Details**\n\nInsikt Group created a proprietary tool to scan URLs for the TwoFace\nweb shell. The configuration used to scan for TwoFace web shell\nusing the tool is in the table below.\n\n**Rule Name** Turla_TwoFace_Webshell_Detection\n\n**HTTP Method** GET\n\n**Collection Filter** .aspx\n\n**HTTP Headers** N/A\n\n**HTTP Payload** N/A\n\n\"function use() { var n = document; var\n\nd = n.getElementById(\"d\").innerHTML; d\n\n**Expected** = d.substring(0, d.lastIndexOf('\\\\') + 1);\n**Controller** n.getElementsByName(\"cmd\")[0].value +=\n**Response (RegEx)** d; n.getElementsByName(\"sav\")[0].value +=\n\nd; n.getElementsByName(\"don\")[0].value\n\n+= d; }\"\n\n_Scanner configuration for TwoFace web shell._\n\nThis configuration will first gather all URLs from our source list that\nhave a \"*.aspx\" filename in the path. The Recorded Future scanner\nwill connect to each URL. By connecting, we pull the content of the\n.aspx file as shown in the image below.\n\n|Rule Name|Turla_TwoFace_Webshell_Detection|\n|---|---|\n|HTTP Method|GET|\n|Collection Filter|.aspx|\n|HTTP Headers|N/A|\n|HTTP Payload|N/A|\n|Expected Controller Response (RegEx)|\"function use() { var n = document; var d = n.getElementById(\"d\").innerHTML; d = d.substring(0, d.lastIndexOf('\\\\') + 1); n.getElementsByName(\"cmd\")[0].value += d; n.getElementsByName(\"sav\")[0].value += d; n.getElementsByName(\"don\")[0].value += d; }\"|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Automated retrieval of .aspx files._\n\nWe then search the response for known TwoFace web shell strings\nto determine whether the URL leads to a TwoFace web shell. Insikt\nGroup analysts used the JavaScript snippet in the image below as\nan indicator of the TwoFace web shell.\n\n_Automated retrieval of .aspx files._\n\n#### Outlook\n\nTurla Group is a sophisticated threat actor, and despite many\nnation-state groups becoming more reliant on open source and\ncommodity software for operations, Turla has continued to develop\nits own unique, advanced malware. The Reductor RAT, a new strain\n[of malware for Turla first observed in late 2019, is an example of](https://securelist.com/compfun-successor-reductor/93633/)\nsuch an innovation. Insikt Group expects to see continued use of\nReductor RAT in 2020.\n\nWhile still using effective older techniques like virtual file systems\nwith Gazer and the Outlook backdoor, Turla has consistently\nadopted newer methods like Reductor’s alteration of browser\npseudo-number generation, and continually developed new tools,\nsuch as their recent .NET and PowerShell backdoors.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this does not mean Turla does not use any\ngeneric tools; Turla has used open source tools regularly, including\nMimikatz and Metasploit as delivery mechanisms for the Mosquito\nbackdoor.\n\nTurla Group is assessed by Insikt Group to be a well-funded,\nadvanced nation-state group that has been active and improving its\ntools and practices for many years. Although we expect its targeting\nand practices to shift over time, Insikt Group assesses that Turla\nGroup will remain an active, advanced threat for years to come that\nwill continue to surprise with unique operational concepts. However,\nthe group’s consistent patterns and use of stable and periodically\nupdated versions of unique malware for lengthy campaigns may\nallow proactive tracking and identification of its infrastructure and\nactivities in the future.\n\n**About Recorded Future**\n\nRecorded Future delivers security intelligence to amplify the effectiveness of\n\nsecurity and IT teams by informing decisions in real time with contextual, actionable\n\nintelligence.
