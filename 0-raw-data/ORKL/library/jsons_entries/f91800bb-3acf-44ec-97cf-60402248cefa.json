attack\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uc-san-diego-health-discloses-data-breach-after-phishing-attack/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uc-san-diego-health-discloses-data-breach-after-phishing-attack/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nJuly 27, 2021\n04:06 PM\n0\n\nUC San Diego Health, the academic health system of the University of California, San\nDiego, has disclosed a data breach after the compromise of some employees' email\naccounts.\n\nUC San Diego Health is one of the nation's best hospitals, being repeatedly ranked as the\nbest health care system in San Diego, according to the 2021-2022 U.S. News & World\nReport survey.\n\nThe health system operates UC San Diego Medical Center, Jacobs Medical Center, and\nSulpizio Cardiovascular Center under one license, with a total capacity of 808 beds.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen asked for additional details regarding the data breach, UC San Diego Health s\nExecutive Director of Communications and Media Relations Jacqueline Carr told\nBleepingComputer that the breach was the result of a phishing attack.\n\n## Personal info of patients, students, and employees exposed\n\nUC San Diego Health discovered unauthorized access to some of its employees' email\naccounts on April 8, after being initially alerted to suspicious activity on March 12.\n\nAfter discovering the breach, UC San Diego Health terminated the unauthorized access to\nthe compromised accounts and reported the event to law enforcement and the FBI.\n\nThe attackers may have accessed or acquired the personal information of patients,\nemployees, and students between December 2, 2020, and April 8, 2021, after breaching\nthe email accounts in a phishing attack.\n\nWhile the threat actors had access to the email accounts for more than four months, an\nongoing investigation by its security teams and external cybersecurity experts has not found\nany evidence that this information has been misused since the attack.\n\nThe personal information accessed during the incident could potentially include: full name,\naddress, date of birth, email, fax number, claims information (date and cost of health care\nservices and claims identifiers), laboratory results, medical diagnosis and conditions,\nMedical Record Number and other medical identifiers, prescription information, treatment\ninformation, medical information, Social Security number, government identification number,\npayment card number or financial account number and security code, student ID number,\nand username and password.\n\nThere is no \"no evidence that other UC San Diego Health systems were impacted, nor do\nwe have any evidence at this time that the information has been misused,\" the academic\n[health system explained.](https://health.ucsd.edu/data-security/Pages/faq.aspx)\n\n\"In addition to notifying individuals whose personal information may have been involved, UC\nSan Diego Health has taken remediation measures which have included, among other\nsteps, changing employee credentials, disabling access points, and enhancing our security\nprocesses and procedures.\"\n\n## Potentially impacted individuals warned of identity theft risks\n\nUC San Diego Health also warned community members and potentially affected individuals\nto keep an eye out for identity theft or fraud attempts.\n\n\"You can do this by regularly reviewing and monitoring your financial statements, credit\nreports, and Explanations of Benefits (EOBs) from your health insurers for any unauthorized\nactivity,\" UC San Diego Health added.\n\n\n-----\n\nUC San Diego Health also advises rotating credentials and enabling multifactor\nauthentication (MFA) for personal online accounts whenever possible.\n\nAfter the ongoing investigation ends (likely around September 30), UC San Diego Health\nwill send individual breach notification letters to students, employees, and patients affected\nby the data breach.\n\nIn June 2018, [UC San Diego Health also informed 619 patients that they might have been](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2018-06-28-media-statement-nuance-data-breach-includes-uc-san-diego-health-patients.aspx)\naffected by an external data breach involving Nuance Communications, a third-party\nmedical transcription provider.\n\nThe breach alert came after Nuance's medical transcription platforms were breached\nbetween November 20, 2017, and December 9, 2017.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Fake Trezor data breach emails used to steal cryptocurrency
