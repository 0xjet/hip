    "plain_text": "# The IO Offensive: Information Operations Surrounding the Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\n**[mandiant.com/resources/information-operations-surrounding-ukraine](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/information-operations-surrounding-ukraine)**\n\nThe recent phase of Russian aggression toward Ukraine, manifested by Russia’s full-scale\ninvasion, has flooded the information environment with disinformation promoted by a full\nspectrum of actors. Concerted information operations have proliferated, ranging from cyberenabled information operations, including those that coincided with disruptive and\ndestructive cyber threat activity, to campaigns leveraging coordinated and inauthentic\nnetworks of accounts to promote fabricated content and desired narratives across various\nsocial media platforms, websites, and forums.\n\nWhile the full extent of this activity has yet to be seen, more than two months after the start\nof the invasion, Mandiant has identified activity that we attributed to information operations\ncampaigns conducted by actors we judge to be operating in support of the political interests\nof nation-states such as Russia, Belarus, China, and Iran, including ongoing campaigns that\nwe have tracked for years. This report examines a slice of this activity, highlighting significant\ninformation operations Mandiant has observed in our work responding to the invasion and\npresenting our early analysis of those events.\n\n## Information Operations Aligned with Russian Interests Concurrent with Disruptive and Destructive Cyber Threat Activity\n\nMandiant identified information operations aligned with Russian political interests that\noccurred concurrently with disruptive and destructive, likely Russian sponsored cyber threat\nactivity in the weeks immediately preceding and following the start of the invasion, including\nincidents involving the deployment of wiper malware disguised as ransomware (Table 1).\nCyber-enabled information operations by nature require access to diverse skillsets to support\ndifferent operational components, which varies based on the complexity of the operation.\nWhile we cannot link these operations to the concurrent disruptive and destructive activity,\nthis limited pattern of overlap may suggest that some of the actors behind information\noperations observed in this conflict are linked to groups with extensive capabilities.\n\n**Date** **Information Operation** **Concurrent Disruptive and**\n**Destructive Activity**\n\n\n-----\n\nJan.\n14,\n2022\n\nFeb.\n23,\n2022\n\nMarch\n16,\n2022\n\n\nMultiple Ukrainian government websites,\nincluding that of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\nwere defaced with a message in Russian,\nUkrainian, and Polish claiming that data had\nbeen deleted from government servers and\nwould be released.\n\nDozens of Ukrainian government websites were\ndefaced with the same image displayed in the\nJan. 14 incident.\n\nAn information operation targeting Ukraine\npromoted a fabricated message alleging\nUkraine's surrender to Russia via the suspected\ncompromise and defacement of the Ukraine 24\nwebsite and news ticker in a Ukraine 24 TV\nbroadcast with a written message, as well as via\nan artificial intelligence (AI)-generated\n\"deepfake\" video impersonating Ukrainian\nPresident Zelenskyy delivering that same text.\n\n\nThe defacements likely\ncoincided with the January\ndeployment of destructive\ntools [PAYWIPE, an MBR wiper](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--5dbc65e2-30cb-5192-a250-5e963ea4f28f)\ndisguised as ransomware, and\nthe [SHADYLOOK file](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--3f93d249-92aa-5d0b-a913-89e7cc387b43)\ncorrupter against Ukrainian\ngovernment and other targets.\n\nThis incident coincided with\ndestructive attacks against\nUkrainian government targets\nusing the [NEARMISS master](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--a38ee36d-0b6b-502f-94c2-a1aa3c68007d)\nboot record (MBR) wiper and\n[PARTYTICKET wiper](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--37d957ec-e8d6-544a-9585-bba4000e4ebe)\ndisguised as ransomware.\n\nOn the same day, Mandiant\n[identified the JUNKMAIL wiper](https://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--4588f890-ea26-5ac1-a306-517c76da525e)\ntargeting a Ukrainian\norganization. The malware\nwas configured via a\nscheduled task to execute\napproximately three hours\nbefore Zelenskyy was\nscheduled to deliver a speech\nto the U.S. Congress.\n\n\nTable 1: Significant information operations that occurred concurrent with other disruptive or\n\ndestructive cyber threat activity\n\n## Russian and Belarusian Information Operations Include Cyber- Enabled Operations, Use of Established Assets\n\nRussian and Belarusian information operations actors and campaigns, including those that\nhave historically been linked to cyber threat activity such as hack-and-leak operations, have\nengaged in activity surrounding the invasion that is consistent with their previously\nestablished motives. Their use of developed campaign infrastructure, including in some\ninstances the refocusing of established assets, demonstrates how years-long efforts of\nRussian, pro-Russian, and Belarusian information operations targeting Ukraine and the\nbroader region have been leveraged to address emerging security interests. In addition to\nknown campaigns, we have also identified information operations activity promoting proRussian content on the invasion that we have not attributed to a previously observed\ncampaign or actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Vectors leveraged by identified Russia-aligned actors and campaigns in observed information\noperations surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \"Russia-aligned\" refers to Russian, Belarusian,\n\nand pro-Russia activity; this graphic does not reflect activity pre-dating this conflict\n\n**[APT28: Telegram channels that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has attributed as](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vykryla-ahenturnu-merezhu-spetssluzhb-rf-yaka-destabilizuvala-sytuatsiiu-v-ukraini-cherez-telegramkanaly)**\ninformation operations assets of the 85th Main Special Service Center of the Russian General\nStaff’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the same organization to which the U.S. and UK\ngovernments [attributed APT28 activity, have continued to post content pertaining to the](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF)\ncurrent conflict. These channels were active prior to the invasion, and while we were unable\nto independently confirm the SBU’s attribution, we note that the channels’ activity includes\npromoting content that appears intended to weaken Ukrainians’ confidence in their\ngovernment and its response to the invasion. The content also appears intended to\nundermine support for Ukraine from its Western partners, interspersed with more seemingly\nbenign posts relaying apolitical content or news reporting.\n\nAPT28 [has an extensive history of involvement in information operations, ranging from](https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/APT28-Center-of-Storm-2017.pdf)\nhack-and-leak operations to disruptive activity. Prominent operations involving APT28\nhave included compromises of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) and\nU.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) in 2016, documents from\nwhich were subsequently leaked by the false hacktivist persona Guccifer 2.0, and the\n2014 compromise, defacement, data leak, and data destruction of the Ukrainian Central\nElection Commission’s network and website.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Ghostwriter: A suspected Ghostwriter operation in April leveraged a suspected](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)**\ncompromised website and multiple suspected compromised or otherwise actor-controlled\nsocial media accounts to publish fabricated content to promote a narrative that appeared\nintended to foment distrust between Ukrainians and the Polish government. Inauthentic\npersonas we attributed to the Ghostwriter campaign have also continued to publish and\npromote opinion articles criticizing NATO and its presence in the Baltic States, with\n[increased references to Ukraine in that context. We have assessed with moderate confidence](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\nthat Belarus is likely at least partially responsible for the Ghostwriter campaign.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the invasion and subsequent weeks thereafter, we observed\nmultiple campaigns conducted by Belarusian espionage group UNC1151 targeting\nEuropean countries, including a recent spear-phishing campaign targeting Lithuania.\nObserved targeting associated with UNC1151 threat activity is notable, given the group’s\n[technical support to information operations attributed to Ghostwriter.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)\n\n**Niezależny Dziennik Polityczny (NDP): Immediately following Russia’s invasion of**\nUkraine, we observed assets associated with NDP, an information operations campaign\ncentered around an online journal of the same name, shift toward an aggressive defense of\nRussian strategic interests. During this period, we observed the campaign’s concerted\npromotion of narratives seeded by both overt and covert sources within Russia’s propaganda\nand disinformation ecosystem. We do not attribute the NDP campaign to a specific actor.\nHowever, we have observed overlaps between NDP and the Ghostwriter campaign that may\nsuggest some degree of coordination or advanced shared knowledge of operational planning\nbetween the two campaigns.\n\n**Secondary Infektion: Both prior to and during the invasion, the ongoing suspected**\nRussian influence campaign referred to as “Secondary Infektion” has continued its\noperations, targeting audiences with fabricated narratives that are often supported by\nfalsified source materials, such as forged documents, correspondence, pamphlets, and\nscreenshots, as well as counterfeit petitions and interviews. All specific Secondary Infektion\nactivity referenced in this blog are operations that we are sharing our attribution of publicly\nfor the first time.\n\n**Internet Research Agency (IRA): Reporting from the Russian newspaper Fontanka.ru**\nsuggested the existence of covert influence operations related to the Telegram channel “Cyber\nFront Z.” The channel is overtly dedicated to organizing the coordinated promotion of proRussia content pertaining to the invasion to audiences in Russia, Ukraine, and the West on\nsocial media (Figure 2). The Fontanka.ru report claimed that Cyber Front Z may be run by\n[individuals linked to entities sanctioned by the U.S. as related to the IRA, and that the paid](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20190930)\npositions promoted by this Telegram channel are part of a “troll factory” that uses\ninauthentic personas to promote pro-Russia content on multiple platforms. We are unable to\nindependently confirm these claims, but note that such activity is aligned with what we have\npreviously observed from known IRA assets.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Example of content posted to the Cyber Front Z Telegram channel, which it\n\nencourages its followers to post on the social media accounts of specified targets.\nProvided content often includes crude or offensive imagery; featured here is a meme\n\nof Ukrainian forces trapped at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol while a cartoon\n\nRussian soldier calls in an airstrike\n\n**Russian Intelligence-Linked Covert Media Outlets: We observed outlets that self-**\n[present as independent entities, but have been publicly reported to be linked to Russian](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126)\nintelligence entities, engaged in the publication and amplification of pro-Russia narratives\nrelated to the invasion. These include outlets with reported links to the Foreign Intelligence\n\n\n-----\n\nService of the Russian Federation (SVR), Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation\n(FSB), and Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian\nFederation (GRU).\n\n**Russia-Aligned “Hacktivist” Groups: Established hacktivist personas JokerDNR and**\nBeregini have remained active in their targeting of Ukraine in the leadup to and since\nRussia’s invasion, including through their publication of allegedly leaked documents\nfeaturing possible personally identifiable information (PII) of Ukrainian military members.\nAdditionally, newly established “hacktivist” groups, whose degrees of affiliation to the\n[Russian state are yet unknown, like Killnet, Xaknet, and RahDit, have engaged in hacktivist-](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-110a)\nstyle threat activity in support of Russia, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)\nattacks, hack-and-leak operations, and defacements.\n\n## Observed Pro-Russia Narratives Seek to Demoralize Ukrainians, Sow Division Between Ukraine and Western Allies, Bolster Public Perception of Russia\n\nDisinformation narratives promoted through concerted information operations have made\nan array of claims attempting to shape perceptions of the invasion and the larger geopolitical\ncontext surrounding it. Many of the narratives we have observed promoted appear intended\nto serve at least one of these three functions: demoralizing Ukrainians and fomenting\ninternal unrest; dividing Ukraine from its allies; and bolstering perceptions of Russia (Figure\n3). Much of this activity has targeted audiences in Ukraine and Europe. However, we have\nalso identified information operations assets promoting messaging that we judge to be aimed\nat Russian domestic audiences, underscoring Russia’s need to sell the war to its own people.\n\nFigure 3: Observed Russia-aligned narrative themes related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\n### Demoralize the Ukrainian Population\n\nWe have identified multiple narratives that appeared intended to demoralize Ukrainians and\nincite internal unrest within Ukraine, including false claims of the surrender of the Ukrainian\ngovernment or military.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn information operation in March disseminated an artificial intelligence (AI)generated “deepfake” video of Zelenskyy stating that Ukraine had surrendered to\nRussia, and defaced the Ukraine 24 website and news ticker in a Ukraine 24 TV\nbroadcast with an identical message or screenshot from the deepfake video (Figure 4).\nSince the start of the war, other Ukrainian websites have also been defaced with\nmessages alleging Ukraine’s surrender.\nA Secondary Infektion operation in March falsely claimed that Zelenskyy had\ncommitted suicide in the military bunker in Kyiv where he had been leading the fight\nagainst the invasion, alleging that he had been contemplating suicide due to Ukraine’s\nmilitary failures.\nAnother Secondary Infektion operation from April alleged that the Azov “gang” sought\nvengeance against Zelenskyy for abandoning their fighters to die in Mariupol, and\nclaimed that Azov commanders had attempted to escape the city by pretending to be\ncivilians. (The narrative here specifically refers to Ukraine's Azov Regiment, a special\noperations detachment within the Ukrainian National Guard, which is itself part of a\nbroader ultranationalist movement—segments of which have been known to espouse\nwhite nationalist rhetoric; Azov has frequently appeared in pro-Russia narratives\nseeking to cast the Ukrainian government, and Ukrainians more broadly, as Nazis.)\nTelegram channels attributed by Ukraine to the GRU highlighted alleged corruption\nand incompetence on the part of the Ukrainian government, such as claims that\nUkraine was unprepared for the conflict, and that Ukrainian oligarchs had “paid\nZelenskyy for the right to leave the country.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Screenshot from an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated “deepfake” video of Zelenskyy stating\n\nthat Ukraine would surrender to Russia\n\n### Divide Ukraine from Its Allies\n\nA recent Ghostwriter operation, which we are making our attribution of public for the\nfirst time, leveraged compromised assets to publish fabricated content promoting the\nnarrative that a Polish criminal ring was harvesting organs from Ukrainian refugees to\nillegally traffic in the European Union, and that Poland’s Internal Security Agency was\ninvestigating the criminal enterprise, which was said to involve “high-ranking Polish\nofficials.”\n\n\n-----\n\nOpinion articles published by suspected inauthentic personas associated with NDP\npromoted narratives seemingly intended to damage Polish-Ukrainian relations by\ncreating fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding Poland’s acceptance of\nUkrainian refugees. These narratives included falsehoods that sought to portray the\nrefugees as overly burdening Poland’s economy and healthcare system and to stoke\nfears among Polish citizens that “neo-Nazis”, or other undesirable immigrants, would\nbegin exploiting mass border crossings to carry out attacks on Polish soil.\nThe Jan. 14 and Feb. 23 defacements of Ukrainian government websites referenced war\ncrimes committed by the \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\" (UPA) against ethnic Poles\nduring World War II, a theme previously observed in Russian and Belarusian\ninformation operations. For example, a November 2021 Ghostwriter operation featured\na fabricated account from a retired Polish general, stating that the alleged presence of\nUkrainian volunteers with far-right political leanings in Poland was “an insult” to the\nvictims of the same war crimes.\nRecent Ukrainian- and Russian-language Secondary Infektion operations claimed that\nthe Ukrainian and Polish governments sought to enable Polish troops to deploy in\nwestern Ukraine, a move they portrayed as anathema to the Ukrainian people. One\noperation in early April claimed that Poland attempted to use an alleged “provocation,”\nstaged by Ukraine, showing Russian troops committing atrocities in Bucha to justify\nstationing troops in the country, while an operation in early February involved the\ndissemination of a map showing specific locations where Polish troops would be\nlocated, with the suggestion that those troops would occupy large swaths of Ukraine for\nyears (Figure 5).\nObserved narratives from Telegram channels Ukraine attributed to the GRU included\nsuggestions that the West would soon forget about and abandon Ukraine, due in part to\nthe diversion of its attention to impending conflicts elsewhere, such as a potential war\nlaunched by the U.S. against Iran.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: A map disseminated in a suspected Secondary Infektion operation claimed to show specific\n\nlocations where Polish troops would be stationed in western Ukraine\n\n### Bolster Perceptions of Russia\n\nMultiple identified narratives have appeared intended to bolster perceptions of Russia\nthrough denial and deflection, including by refuting Russian war crimes in Ukraine and\nmaking counter-allegations against Ukrainian forces.\n\nCyber Front Z, in its coordinated promotion of pro-Russia commentary, called on social\nmedia users to claim that Ukrainian “Nazis” forced civilians into a theater in Mariupol,\nwhich they then detonated.\nWe identified a coordinated and inauthentic network of social media accounts that\npromoted Russian-language messaging, including assertions that Ukrainian forces had\nused chemical weapons.\nThese accounts also denied the effects of the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine, such as sanctions on Russia, and claimed that such measures had negative\nconsequences for the West.\n\n## Pro-PRC Information Operations Campaign DRAGONBRIDGE Messaging Includes Echoes of Russian State-Promoted Narratives\n\n[DRAGONBRIDGE, a pro-PRC campaign which comprises a network of thousands of](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/pro-prc-influence-campaign-expands-dozens-social-media-platforms-websites-and-forums)\ninauthentic accounts across numerous social media platforms, websites, and forums that we\nfirst reported to customers in 2019, has shifted its messaging in response to the Ukraine\n\n\n-----\n\ncrisis and subsequent invasion. DRAGONBRIDGE content in English and Chinese has\nincluded echoing narratives promoted by Russian state media and influence campaigns, such\nas alleging the existence of Pentagon-linked laboratories conducting biological weapons\nresearch in Ukraine. Notably, such echoing of narratives is not unusual, and charging the\nU.S. with malfeasance and interference in other countries is likewise in line with PRC\npolitical interests; we have previously observed both pro-PRC and pro-Russia information\noperations promoting content on the alleged involvement of U.S. biolabs in hazardous\nresearch. The campaign’s leveraging of Russia-aligned narratives on Ukraine may constitute\na form of political opportunism in its continued attempts to target the U.S. and the West’s\nglobal standing.\n\n[On March 6, Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov claimed that](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-lavrov-biolab-weapons-united-nations-pettersson-1689402)\nRussia’s military operation in Ukraine had uncovered evidence of Pentagon-linked\nlaboratories in Ukraine conducting bioweapons research. DRAGONBRIDGE accounts\nsubsequently amplified this claim, including allegations that U.S.-funded biolabs\nexisted not only in Ukraine, but also around the world.\nDRAGONBRIDGE accounts also insinuated that the alleged biolabs in Ukraine were\nresponsible for “mysterious outbreaks,” the nature of which went unexplained, and that\nbiolabs elsewhere in the world were likewise harming local populations (Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Screenshot from DRAGONBRIDGE video insinuating a connection between the presence of a\n\nU.S. biolab in Ukraine and the occurrence of multiple “mysterious outbreaks”\n\nDRAGONBRIDGE messaging on the invasion also appeared to take aim at U.S. foreign policy\nand its relations with other countries through claims that the U.S. is self-serving in its actions\nand that it is an unreliable partner in its alliances. Some accounts alleged that the U.S. sought\n\n\n-----\n\nto fan the flames of the conflict as it stood to benefit the most, citing its arms sales to\nUkraine, while others cast doubt on the U.S. and Europe’s seeming policy alignment on\nsanction measures against Russia, suggesting that the U.S. had bullied Europe into enacting\nthose sanctions, despite deepening energy woes on the continent.\n\n## Pro-Iran Information Operations Denigrate Western Response to Conflict, Take Aim at Russia-Israel Relationship\n\nSimilarly, Mandiant has observed Iranian and pro-Iran information operations leveraging\nnarratives pertaining to the invasion to take aim at the West, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.\n[Involved campaigns have included the Liberty Front Press (LFP) campaign, as well as activity](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/suspected-iranian-influence-operation)\nfrom a pro-Iran campaign we have not previously named that we are dubbing “Roaming\nMayfly”, due to its potential links to the Iran-aligned Endless Mayfly influence campaign that\n[Citizen Lab reported on in 2019.](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/)\n\nMessaging directed at Arabic-language audiences asserted that the U.S. fled from\nAfghanistan in 2021, and had now abandoned Ukraine, which deserved its fate due to\nits alliance with the “American axis of evil.” Similarly, English-language content\naverred that NATO had sacrificed Ukraine to avoid engaging in a war with Russia.\nPro-Iran information operations assets also declared that Ukraine should not have\nsurrendered its nuclear weapons, implying that such a concession had left it vulnerable\nto the subsequent invasion.\nPro-Iran information operations have also leveraged the conflict to accuse the West of\nhypocrisy in its dealings with Saudi Arabia compared to Russia, by juxtaposing the war\nin Ukraine against the war in Yemen. Tangentially, assets leveled accusations of racism\non the part of the West against Arabs and Muslims, noting alleged differences in its\nresponse to the conflict in Ukraine in comparison to conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nWe also observed Roaming Mayfly target Russian audiences on the eve of the war in what\nappeared to be an attempt to use the crisis in order to drive tensions between Russia and\nIsrael. Namely, the campaign leveraged a (now-suspended) impersonator of the Russian\njournalist and foreign policy thinker, Fyodor Lukyanov, to publish tweets suggesting that\nIsraeli intelligence was supporting Ukraine against Russia in the current crisis, and that\nIsrael had supported the “Ukrainian color [revolutions]” of 2000, 2004, and 2014 (Figure 7).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Tweets by suspected Fyodor Lukyanov impersonator suggesting that Israeli intelligence was\nsupporting Ukraine against Russia in the current crisis and that Israel had supported the “Ukrainian color\n\n[revolutions]” of 2000, 2004, and 2014\n\n## Outlook\n\nInformation operations observed in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have\nexhibited both tactical aims responding to, or seeking to shape, events on the ground and\nstrategic objectives attempting to influence the shifting geopolitical landscape. While these\noperations have presented an outsized threat to Ukraine, they have also threatened the U.S.\nand other Western countries. As a result, we anticipate that such operations, including those\ninvolving cyber threat activity and potentially other disruptive and destructive attacks, will\ncontinue as the conflict progresses.\n\nOne notable feature of operations attributed to known actors thus far is their apparent\nconsistency with the respective campaign’s established motives. Russia-aligned operations,\nincluding those attributed to Russian, Belarusian, and pro-Russia actors, have thus far\nemployed the widest array of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to support tactical\nand strategic objectives, directly linked to the conflict itself. This is especially beneficial when\nthe facts on the ground shape Russia’s need to influence events in Ukraine, marshal domestic\nRussian support, and manage global perceptions of Russia’s actions. Meanwhile, pro-PRC\nand pro-Iran campaigns have leveraged the Russian invasion opportunistically to further\nprogress long-held strategic objectives. We likewise expect this dynamic to continue, and are\nactively monitoring for expansions in their scope of information operations activity\nsurrounding the conflict.\n\n\n-----",
