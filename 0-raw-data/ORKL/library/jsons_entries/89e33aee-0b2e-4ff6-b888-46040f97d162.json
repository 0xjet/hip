The firm said it could\nnot yet estimate the losses.\n\nTechnical trade secrets were stolen from the steel production and manufacturing plant design\ndivisions of Thyssenkrupp in cyber attacks earlier this year, the company announced\nThursday.\n\nIn breaches discovered by the firm's internal security team in April and traced back to\nFebruary, hackers stole project data from a variety of divisions, Thyssenkrupp said while\ndeclining to explain why the company had not previously disclosed the attacks.\n\nThe [steelmaker attributed the breaches to unnamed attackers in southeast Asia in what it](https://www.dw.com/en/thyssenkrupp-profit-squeezed-by-global-steel-glut/a-36502748)\nsaid were \"organized, highly professional hacker activities.\"\n\n**More to come?**\n\nCyber attacks on banks or retailers have become a frequent phenomenon globally, causing\nwidespread consumer data breaches and mounting financial losses, but revelations of\nindustrial espionage are still rare.\n\nThyssenkrupp's belated disclosure came just one week after an attack on nearly 1 million\nrouters caused outages for Deutsche Telekom customers in Germany.\n\nGerman business magazine \"Wirtschaftswoche\" reported the attacks on Thyssenkrupp hit\nsites in Europe, India, Argentina and the US.\n\n\n-----\n\nA criminal complaint was filed with police in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and an\ninvestigation is ongoing.\n\nThyssenkrupp noted the infected computer systems had been cleansed and were now\nsubject to constant monitoring against potential intruders.\n\nhg/jd (Reuters, dpa)\n\n**Date 08.12.2016**\n**Related Subjects** [ThyssenKrupp](https://www.dw.com/en/thyssenkrupp/t-19109954)\n**Keywords** [Thyssenkrupp,](https://www.dw.com/search/en?languageCode=en&origin=gN&item=Thyssenkrupp&searchNavigationId=9097) [hackers,](https://www.dw.com/search/en?languageCode=en&origin=gN&item=hackers&searchNavigationId=9097) [cyber attack,](https://www.dw.com/search/en?languageCode=en&origin=gN&item=cyber+attack&searchNavigationId=9097) [secrets](https://www.dw.com/search/en?languageCode=en&origin=gN&item=secrets&searchNavigationId=9097)\nSend us your feedback.\n**Print** Print this page\n**Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2Ty8L**\n\n[© 2022 Deutsche Welle | Privacy Policy |](https://www.dw.com/en/european-union-general-data-protection-regulationgdpr-valid-may-25-2018/a-18265246) [Accessibility Statement |](https://www.dw.com/en/accessibility-statement/a-54925999) [Legal notice |](https://www.dw.com/imprint) [Contact |](https://www.dw.com/contact)\n[Mobile version](https://m.dw.com/en/thyssenkrupp-victim-of-cyber-attack/a-36695341)\n\n[© 2022 Deutsche Welle | Privacy Policy |](https://www.dw.com/en/european-union-general-data-protection-regulationgdpr-valid-may-25-2018/a-18265246) [Accessibility Statement |](https://www.dw.com/en/accessibility-statement/a-54925999) [Legal notice |](https://www.dw.com/imprint) [Contact |](https://www.dw.com/contact)\n[Mobile version](https://m.dw.com/en/thyssenkrupp-victim-of-cyber-attack/a-36695341)\n\n\n-----",
