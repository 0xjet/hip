The attack is relentless, relying on simplicity to hide in\nplain sight, without the need to develop sophisticated tools or exploits.\n\nUsing an arsenal of over 80 unique tools & scripts, the group executes its attacks patiently\nover long periods of time, blending in with the target’s environment and going completely\nundetected while it quietly liberates organizations of large amounts of money.\n\nElephant Beetle seems to primarily focus on Latin American targets, but that doesn’t mean\nthat organizations not based there are safe. For example, our IR team discovered that the\nLatin American operations of a U.S. company had been breached. As such, both regional\nand global organizations should be on their guard.\n\nThe group is highly proficient with Java based attacks and, in many cases, targets legacy\nJava applications running on Linux-based machines as a means of initial entry to the\nenvironment. Beyond that, the group even deploys their own complete Java web application\non victim machines to do their bidding while the machine also runs legitimate applications.\nElephant Beetle operates in a well-organized and stealthy pattern, efficiently executing each\nphase of its attack plan once inside a compromised environment:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. During the first phase, which can span up to a month, the group focuses on building\n\n**operational cyber capabilities in the compromised environment. The group studies**\nthe digital landscape and plants backdoors while customizing its tools to work within\nthe victim environment.\n2. The group then spends several months studying the victim’s environment, focusing\n\n**on the financial operation and identifying any flaws. During this stage, they observe**\nvictim software and infrastructure to understand the technical process of legitimate\nfinancial transactions.\n3. The group then creates fraudulent transactions in the environment. These\n\ntransactions mimic legitimate behavior and siphon off incremental amounts of money\nfrom the victim. Although the amount of money stolen in a single transaction may seem\ninsignificant, the group stacks numerous transactions to what amounts to millions of\ndollars.\n\n4. If during its efforts any theft activity is discovered and blocked, the group then simply\n\n**lays low for a few months only to return and target a different system.**\n\n## DEFENDING AGAINST AN ELEPHANT BEETLE ATTACK\n\nThis report is a technical play-by-play of the Elephant Beetle attack as detected, observed\nand mitigated by Sygnia’s IR team.\n\nWe share the threat actor’s modus operandi, in-depth analysis of its capabilities, and provide\nactionable insights, IOCs and guidelines for defending against the attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Contributors: Amnon Kushnir, Noam Lifshitz, Yoav Mazor, Oren Biderman, Boaz_\n_Wasserman, Itay Shohat and Arie Zilberstein._\n\n\n-----",
