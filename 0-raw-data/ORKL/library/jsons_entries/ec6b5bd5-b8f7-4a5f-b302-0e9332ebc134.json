(Part 1 of 2)\n\n**decoded.avast.io/janrubin/the-king-is-dead-long-live-mykings/**\n\nby [Jan Rubín and Jakub KaločOctober 12, 202114 min read](https://decoded.avast.io/janrubin/the-king-is-dead-long-live-mykings/)\n\n\nOctober 12, 2021\n\n\nMyKings is a long-standing and relentless botnet which has been active from at least 2016. Since then it has spread and extended\nits infrastructure so much that it has even gained multiple names from multiple analysts around the world — MyKings, Smominru,\nand DarkCloud, for example. Its vast infrastructure consists of multiple parts and modules, including bootkit, coin miners, droppers,\nclipboard stealers, and more.\n\nOur research has shown that, since 2019, the operators behind MyKings have amassed at least $24 million USD (and likely more)\nin the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin cryptowallets associated with MyKings. While we can’t attribute that amount solely to\nMyKings, it still represents a significant sum that can be tied to MyKings activity.\n\nOur hunting for new samples brought us over 6,700 unique samples. Just since the beginning of 2020 (after the release of the\nSophos [whitepaper), we protected over 144,000 Avast users threatened by this clipboard stealer module. Most attacks happened in](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/sophoslabs-uncut-mykings-report.pdf)\nRussia, India, and Pakistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nMap illustrating targeted countries since 1.1.2020 until 5.10.2021\nIn this first part of our two-part blog series, we will peek into the already known clipboard stealer module of MyKings, focusing on its\ntechnical aspects, monetization, and spread. In addition, we’ll look into how the functionality of the clipboard stealer enabled\nattackers to carry out frauds with Steam trade offers and Yandex Disk links, leading to more financial gain and infection spread.\n\nAvast has been tracking the MyKings’ clipboard stealer since the beginning of 2018, but we can’t rule out an even earlier creation\ndate. [Basic functionality of this module was already covered by Gabor Szappanos from SophosLabs, but we are able to contribute](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/sophoslabs-uncut-mykings-report.pdf)\nwith new technical details and IoCs.\n\n## 1. Monetary gain\n\nWhen Sophos released their blog at the end of 2019, they stated that the coin addresses are “not used or never received more than\na few dollars”. After tracing newer samples, we were able to extract new wallet addresses and extend the list of 49 coin addresses\nin [Sophos IoCs to over 1300.](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/malware-MyKings)\n\n[Because of the amount of new data, we decided to share our script, which can query the amount of cryptocurrency transferred](https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/MyKings-clipboard-stealer/extras/wallet_gain.py)\nthrough a crypto account. Because not all blockchains have this possibility, we decided to find out how much money attackers\ngained through Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin accounts. After inspecting these addresses we have confirmed that more than\n$24,700,000 worth in cryptocurrencies was transferred through these addresses. We can safely assume that this number is in reality\nhigher, because the amount consists of money gained in only three cryptocurrencies from more than 20 in total used in malware. It\nis also important to note here that not all of the money present in the cryptowallets necessarily comes from the MyKings campaign\nalone.\n\nAfter taking a closer look at the transactions and inspecting the contents of installers that dropped the clipboard stealer, we believe\nthat part of this money was gained through crypto miners. The clipboard stealer module and the crypto miners were seen using the\nsame wallet addresses.\n\nCryptocurrency Earnings in USD Earnings in cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin 6,626,146.252 [$] 132.212 [BTC]\n\nEthereum 7,429,429.508 [$] 2,158.402 [ETH]\n\nDogecoin 10,652,144.070 [$] 44,618,283.601 [DOGE]\n\n\n-----\n\nTable with monetary gain (data refreshed 5.10.2021)\n\nHistogram of monetary gains for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin wallets\n\n## 2. Attribution\n\nEven though the clipboard stealer and all related files are attributed in previous blog posts to MyKings, we wanted to confirm those\n[claims, because of lack of definitive proof. Some articles (e.g. by Sophos) are saying that some scripts in the attribution chain, like](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical-papers/sophoslabs-uncut-mykings-report.pdf)\n```\nc3.bat may kill other botnets or earlier versions of itself, which raises doubts. Other articles (e.g by Guardicore) are even working\n\n```\nwith the theory of a rival copycat botnet deleting MyKings. MyKings is a large botnet with many modules and before attributing all\nthe monetary gains to this clipboard stealer, we wanted to be able to prove that the clipboard stealer is really a part of MyKings.\n\nWe started our attribution with the sample `d2e8b77fe0ddb96c4d52a34f9498dc7dd885c7b11b8745b78f3f6beaeec8e191 . This`\nsample is a NSIS installer which drops NsCpuCNMiner in both 32 and 64 bit versions.\n\nIn the NSIS header was possible to see this Monero address used for miner configuration:\n\n```\n41xDYg86Zug9dwbJ3ysuyWMF7R6Un2Ko84TNfiCW7xghhbKZV6jh8Q7hJoncnLayLVDwpzbPQPi62bvPqe6jJouHAsGNkg2\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nNSIS header\n\nApart from the NsCpuCNMiner, the sample dropped an additional file with a name `java12.exe into` `C:\\Users\\`\n```\n<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\java.exe . This file has SHA256\n0390b466a8af2405dc269fd58fe2e3f34c3219464dcf3d06c64d01e07821cd7a and according to our data, was downloaded from\nhttp://zcop[.]ru/java12.dat by the installer. This file could be also downloaded from http://kriso[.]ru/java12.dat\n\n```\n(both addresses contained multiple samples with different configurations at different times). This file contains a clipboard stealer.\nAlso, the same Monero address can be found in both the clipboard stealer and the NSIS configuration.\n\n[After researching the Monero address, we found in blogpost written by Tencent Yujian Threat Intelligence Center, that sample](https://freewechat.com/a/MzI5ODk3OTM1Ng==/2247485005/1)\n```\nb9c7cb2ebf3c5ffba6fdeea0379ced4af04a7c9a0760f76c5f075ded295c5ce2 uses the same address. This sample is another\n\n```\nNSIS installer which drops the NsCpuCNMiner and the clipboard stealer. This NSIS installer was usually dropped under the name\n```\nking.exe or king.dat and could be downloaded from http://kr1s[.]ru/king.dat .\n\n```\nIn the next step, we looked into the address `http://kr1s[.]ru/king.dat and we found that at different times, this address`\ncontained the file `f778ca041cd10a67c9110fb20c5b85749d01af82533cc0429a7eb9badc45345c usually dropped into` `C:\\Users\\`\n```\n<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\king.exe or C:\\Windows\\system32\\a.exe . This file is again a NSIS installer that\n\n```\ndownloads clipboard stealer, but this time it contains URLs `http://js[.]mys2016.info:280/helloworld.msi and`\n```\nhttp://js[.]mys2016.info:280/v.sct .\n\n```\nURL `http://js[.]mys2016.info:280/v.sct is interesting, because this URL is also contacted by the sample named`\n```\nmy1.html or  my1.bat or my1.bat with SHA256\n5ae5ff335c88a96527426b9d00767052a3cba3c3493a1fa37286d4719851c45c .\n\n```\nThis file is a batch script which is almost identical to the script with the same name `my1.bat and SHA256`\n```\n2aaf1abeaeeed79e53cb438c3bf6795c7c79e256e1f35e2a903c6e92cee05010, as shown further below.\n\n```\nBoth scripts contain the same strings as `C:\\Progra~1\\shengda,` `C:\\Progra~1\\kugou2010 .`\n\nThere are only two important differences to notice:\n\n1. At line 12, one script uses address `http://js[.]mys2016.info:280/v.sct and the other uses address`\n```\n   http://js[.]1226bye.xyz:280/v.sct .\n\n```\n2. Line 25 in the second script has commands that the first script doesn’t have. You can notice strings like `fuckyoumm3, a very`\n\nwell known indicator of MyKings.\n\n\n-----\n\nComparison of the batch scripts – script `5ae5ff335c88a96527426b9d00767052a3cba3c3493a1fa37286d4719851c45c`\ncontacting the C&C related to the clipboard stealer\n\n\n-----\n\nComparison of the batch scripts – script `2aaf1abeaeeed79e53cb438c3bf6795c7c79e256e1f35e2a903c6e92cee05010 contacting`\nthe C&C related to MyKings\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, it is possible to look at the file `c3.bat with SHA256`\n```\n0cdef01e74acd5bbfb496f4fad5357266dabb2c457bc3dc267ffad6457847ad4 . This file is another batch script which\n\n```\ncommunicates with the address `http://js[.]1226bye.xyz:280/v.sct and contains many MyKings specific strings like`\n```\nfuckayoumm3 or task name Mysa1 .\n\n```\nAttribution\n\n\n-----\n\nchain\n\n## 3. Technical analysis\n\nOur technical analysis of the clipboard stealer focuses primarily on new findings.\n\n## 3.1 Goal of the malware\n\nThe main purpose of the clipboard stealer is rather simple: checking the clipboard for specific content and manipulating it in case it\nmatches predefined regular expressions. This malware counts on the fact that users do not expect to paste values different from the\none that they copied. It is easy to notice when someone forgets to copy and paste something completely different (e.g. a text instead\nof an account number), but it takes special attention to notice the change of a long string of random numbers and letters to a very\nsimilar looking string, such as cryptowallet addresses. This process of swapping is done using functions `OpenClipboard,`\n```\nEmptyClipboard, SetClipboardData and CloseClipboard . Even though this functionality is quite simple, it is concerning that\n\n```\nattackers could have gained over $24,700,000 using such a simple method.\n\n\n-----\n\nSimple routine of the\n\nclipboard content swap\nAs can be seen on image below, most of the regular expressions used for checking the clipboard content will match wallet formats\nof one specific cryptocurrency, but there are also regular expressions to match Yandex file storage, links to the Russian social\nnetwork VKontakte, or Steam trade offer links.\n\n\n-----\n\nList of regular\n\nexpressions matching specific cryptocurrencies and URLs\n[We were able to find many comments from people at BlockChain Explorer services believing that they sent money to the](https://etherscan.io/address/0x039fd537a61e4a7f28e43740fe29ac84443366f6#comments)\nincriminated accounts by a mistake and asking or demanding that their money be sent back. In response to this malicious activity,\nwe want to increase awareness about frauds like this and we highly recommend people always double-check transaction details\nbefore sending money.\n\n\n-----\n\nComments from infected users connected to address `0x039fD537A61E4a7f28e43740fe29AC84443366F6`\n\n## 3.2 Defense & features\n\nSome other blog posts describe a few anti-debugging checks and defense against system monitoring tools, but we can’t confirm any\nnew development.\n\nIn order to avoid multiple executions, the clipboard stealer checks for mutex on execution. The mutex name is created dynamically\nby checking on which version of OS it is launched on. This procedure is performed using functions `RegOpenKeyExA which opens`\nthe registry key `SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion . Afterwards, a function` `RegQueryValueExA is called which`\ngets the value of `ProductName . The value obtained is then concatenated with the constant suffix` `02 . Using this method, you can`\nget many more possibilities of existing mutexes. In the list below, you can find a few examples of mutex names:\n```\n   Windows 7 Professional02\n   Windows 7 Ultimate02\n   Windows 10 Enterprise02\n   Windows 10 Pro02\n   Windows XP02\n\n```\n…\n\nIn a different version of the malware, an alternative value is used from registry key `SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows`\n```\nNT\\CurrentVersion  and value of BuildGUID . This value is then also appended with suffix 02 to create the final mutex name.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAnother mechanism serving as a defense of this malware is trying to hide the addresses of cryptowallets belonging to attackers.\nWhen the malware matches any of the regular expressions in the clipboard, it substitutes the clipboard content with a value that is\nhardcoded inside the malware sample. For protection against quick analysis and against static extraction with regular expressions,\nthe substitute values are encrypted. Encryption used is a very simple ROT cipher, where the key is set to -1.\n\nFor a quick and static extraction of wallets from samples, it’s possible to decrypt the whole sample (which destroys all data except\nwanted values) and then use regular expressions to extract the hidden substitute values. The advantage of this approach is that the\nmalware authors already provided us with all necessary regular expressions; thus the extraction process of the static information\ncan be easily automated.\n\n## 3.3 Newly uncovered functionality\n\nWith a larger dataset of samples, we were also able to reveal the intentions of regular expressions checking for URLs.\n\n### 3.3.1 Steam trade frauds\n\nOne of the regular expressions hardcoded in samples looks like this:\n```\n((https://steamcommunit))(?!.*id|.*id)(([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})|([0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[09]{1,3}))(/[a-zA-Z0-9%:/-_?.',27h,'~&]*)?\n\n```\nThis kind of expression is supposed to match Steam trade offer links. Users on the Steam platform can create trade offers to trade\nwhat are usually in-game items from their inventory with other users. The value of the items that can be traded starts at only a few\ncents, but the most expensive items are being sold for hundreds or thousands dollars.\n\nThe clipboard stealer manipulates the trade offer URL and changes the receiving side, so Steam users send their items to someone\ncompletely unknown. The exchanged link then looks like this one:\n\n```\nhttps://steamcommunity[.]com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=121845838&token=advSgAXy\n\n```\n\nIn total we were able to extract 14 different Steam trade offer links that appeared in almost 200 samples. These links lead us to 14\nSteam accounts — some of which were banned and some had set privacy restrictions — but among the working public accounts we\nwere able to find information that assured us that these frauds happened. An example is this is an account which was bound to the\ntrade offer link listed above:\n\n```\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/rosher\n\n```\n\nAfter checking the comments section of this account, we could see multiple people getting angry and curious as to why their trade\noffer links are getting changed. Even though some people noticed the change in the trade offer link, we suppose that some trades\nwere completed. We were not able to estimate how much money could have been stolen through this technique.\n\nComments from\n```\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/rosher\n\n```\nTranslation of comments:\n\n1. 9 Oct, 2020 @ 7:47 pm why is my trade link changing to yours?\n2. 21 Jul, 2020 @ 2:16 pm Th for the garbage with a trade link !!! ???\n3. 27 Jun, 2020 @ 5:05 am what a fagot what did you do with the link\n\n### 3.3.2 Fake Yandex Disk links\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother functionality is related to the regular expression:\n\n```\n((https://yad))+(([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})|([0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]\n\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches links to Yandex Disk storage. Yandex Disk is a cloud service created by multinational Russian\ncompany Yandex and can be used similarly as Google Drive or Dropbox for sharing files.\n\nThe objective of this technique is to match links that users are sending to their friends and family to share files or photos. If the\nmalware runs on the sender’s machine, the infected victim is sending wrong links to all their acquaintances. If the malware runs on\nthe machine of the user that receives the link and copy/pastes it to the browser address bar, the victim again opens a wrong link. In\nboth cases, the wrong link gets opened by someone unaware that the content is wrong. In both cases, the victim downloads files\nfrom that link and opens them, because there is no reason to not trust the files received from someone they know.\n\nFrom the set of analyzed samples, we extracted following 4 links to Yandex Disk storage:\n\n1. `https://yadi[.]sk/d/cQrSKI0591KwOg`\n2. `https://yadi[.]sk/d/NGyR4jFCNjycVA`\n3. `https://yadi[.]sk/d/zCbAMw973ZQ5t3`\n4. `https://yadi[.]sk/d/ZY1Qw7RRCfLMoQ`\n\nAll of the links contain packed archives in a `.rar or` `.zip format, protected with a password. The password is usually written in`\nthe name of the file. As you can see on the image below, the file is named, for example, as “photos,” with the password `5555 .`\n\nContents on\n\n```\nhttps://disk[.]yandex.ru/d/NGyR4jFCNjycVA\n\n```\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nIn this first part of the blog series, we focused on the MyKings clipboard stealer module, going through the attribution chain and\nuncovering the amounts of money that attackers were able to obtain along the way. The clipboard stealer also focuses on frauds\nregarding Steam trade offers and Yandex Disk file sharing, distributing further malware to unaware victims.\n\nIn the next part of this blog series, we will go down the rabbit hole — exploring the contents of one of the downloaded payloads and\nproviding you with an analysis of the malware inside.
