To that end, Dridex deploys at least three methods [3] :\n\n  - · Injection of an HTML script into the legitimate webpages of online banks that have previously been compromised, which displays malicious forms to customers asking them to provide their access codes;\n\n  - · Redirection towards a malicious page masquerading as the bank[2];\n\n  - · Interception of the server response from the bank’s website and relay towards the threat actors’ PHP server,\nwhich injects the code there.\n\n##### 1.1.2 Modularity\n\nDridex is made up of several modules, including:\n\n  - A loader, tasked with:\n\n**– downloading a list of peers[3];**\n\n**– initial recognition within the information system (IS);**\n\n**– installing the payload;**\n\n**– downloading the additional modules.**\n\n  - · A payload (also known as the core module, which contains the integrated functions and to which other\nmodules may be added in order to expand its functionality.\n\nThe main functions integrated within Dridex’s core module are as follows:\n\n  - A keylogger, which provides the threat actors with context about the victim (screenshots, keyboard input, etc.);\n\n  - Harvesting information and tampering with content on websites (web injection), via interaction with the\nInternet browsers. According to Bromium [4], Dridex is believed to have at least five Web injection[4] techniques.\n\nThis functionality can primarily be extended by the following modules:\n\n  - VNC: this module supplies Virtual Network Computing (VNC)[5] support for the threat actor’s remote access to\nthe victim’s workstation;\n\n  - SOCKS: this gives Dridex a SOCKS proxy support[6];\n\n  - Pony: based on the Pony malware[7], this can steal access codes;\n\n1As well as personal data and account balances.\n2Technique previously leveraged by and most likely borrowed from the trojan Dyre.\n3In the context of Dridex peer-to-peer pseudo-network operations.\n4DLL order hijacking, process hollowing, PE injection, thread execution hijacking and AtomBombing.\n5System for viewing and controlling the desktop environment of a remote computer, using the RFB protocol for communications.\n6The network protocol Secured over credential based kerberos (SOCKS) enables a program to use the services of a firewall during an exchange\nwith an external server\n7Malware and controller of the botnet active since 2011, specialising in the theft of access codes and crypto-assets, but also in the distribution\nof malware, v1.9 of which leaked at the end of 2012 [5]. Pony has distributed such malware as GoZ, Necurs, Dyre, Vawtrak, Cryptolock and\nCribit. In 2013, there were several Pony botnets.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 3 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\n  - Kill OS: deployed across systems identified as belonging to researchers or automated malware analysis systems,\nit erases the master boot record (MBR) from the hard drive in a bid to sabotage the infected workstation;\n\n  - Spammer: this is harnessed to send spam emails;\n\n  - Email stealer: this is run to harvest the victim’s emails.\n\nFig. 1.1 : General composition\n\n##### 1.1.3 Development\n\nDridex is constantly being upgraded. Since 2014, its developers have added regular updates and patches. For example:\n\n  - In November 2014, Dridex embraced not only digital signature theft but also the P2P protocol [6].\n\n  - Dridex is the first known malware to have implemented, in February 2017, a new code injection technique\ndiscovered in October 2016, AtomBombing [4].\n\n  - Attack vectors are changing apace. Accordingly, the changeover from Dridex v3 to v4 in early 2017 came\nhand-in-hand with addition of the vulnerability 0-day MS Word (CVE-2017-0199)[8] [4, 7].\n\n#### 1.2 Botnet use\n\nDridex employs various Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets[9 10] composed of workstations it compromises [9]. Their P2P\narchitecture has three (layers), which makes the end command and control (C2 backend) machines more difficult to\nidentify, so bolstering the infrastructure’s resilience.\n\nThe C2 backend, otherwise known as the root infrastructure, contains the database and management logic of the\nbotnet. It comprises around 24 servers [10]. It transmits new updates of the Pony, Kill OS, Spammer and Email Stealer modules to the nodes. The C2 frontends (admin node), which operate like reverse proxies, and comprise around 15\nservers [10], communicate with the nodes, of which there are believed to be several hundred. These are composed\nof infected systems (bots) and represent the first communication layer in which the rest of the infected systems are\nin contact. They communicate together to maintain the network, extend it, distribute the VNC and SOCKS modules\nand transfer queries to the C2 frontends.\n\n8Vulnerability enabling the concealment of malicious instructions in a document saved in .RTF format.\n9For a clearer grasp of the notion of botnet, an assessment of the threat botnets pose can be found on the CERT-FR website [8].\n10In botnets using this architecture, zombie machines do not communicate directly with the C2 infrastructure, but with other zombie machines\ndefined in an updatable list of peers. As such, only a small number of machines are in contact with the C2 infrastructure run directly by the\nthreat actor. These machines then relay the information transmitted by the C2 to the other infected machines featuring in their list, which\nwill do the same.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 4 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\nFig. 1.2 : How the botnet Dridex works\n\nEach bot (peer) can be identified within the P2P network via two IDs it generates: the bot ID identifies the infected\nuser on a computer and the computer ID identifies the latter. In this way, multiple infections on the same computer can be detected. Moreover, each bot keeps a list of other peers, i.e. IP addresses and port numbers. In order to\nensure this list remains active, the peers ask the nodes for updates at regular intervals.\n\nDridex’ maximum infection rate is considered to have been reached over the 2015-2016 period. In 2015, the main\ncountries to be targeted by Dridex were the UK, Italy and France, which had 1,804 bots. The United States was the\nnext most common target [11].\n\n#### 1.3 Affiliate model\n\nWhile some banking trojans are sold alone and deployed by the customer, Dridex operates according to an affiliate\nmodel. Each affiliate has access to a subset of bots [12], while the group Evil Corp controls the C2 backends of the\ndifferent Dridex botnets.\n\nAccording to the Western District of Pennsylvania Court indictment against members of Evil Corp, the affiliates\napparently purchase Dridex use from the group (e.g. for USD 100,000 in the case of one British mule[11] who became\nan affiliate), then funnel half of the profits along with USD 50,000 per week to the group so as to retain the privilege\nof being able to use it. In return, Evil Corp is said to provide technical support [10].\n\nThe affiliates are distinguished by:\n\n  - their botnet ID, i.e. the number attributed to the Dridex version associated with the subset of bots they\nmanage. With these botnet IDs, the activity of each of the affiliates can be distinguished and different botnet\nIDs can be associated with the same operator [13]. For example, in 2015 Dridex had nine botnets supporting\n\n11Individual who transfers illegally acquired funds via different bank accounts in different countries.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 5 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\nits ecosystem, the three most active being botnets 120[12], 200[13] and 220[14];\n\n  - their targets, both in terms of sector and geography: for example, in 2015, the primary target of botnet ID 120\nwas banks, and France was particularly targeted by botnets 220, 120, 302, 125, 322, 225 and 228 in 2016 and\nbotnet 1011 in 2019 [9, 15];\n\n  - the chosen infection vector.\n\nFig. 1.3 : Main Dridex Botnet IDs from 2015 to today\n\n12Which apparently contained 100,000 bots in May 2015 [10].\n13Which apparently contained 750 bots in April 2015 [14].\n14Which apparently contained 9,650 bots in April 2015 [14, 9].\n\n17/07/2020 Page 6 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\n### 2 Dridex' developers: Evil Corp\n\n_The names given in this chapter come from open sources and judicial documents that have been systematically referenced._\n\n#### 2.1 The group’s origins: ZeuS, JabberZeuS and GameOverZeuS\n\nIn 2005-2006 or thereabouts, M. Bogachev (alias Slavik, lucky12345) created the trojan ZeuS (alias Zbot) (see Appendix 6.1). ZeuS was hired out as malware-as-a-service to other cybercriminal groups [16].\n\nIn early 2009, M. Bogachev began working with the cybercriminal group named ”Business Club”, allegedly led by\nM. Yakubets (alias Aqua) [17]. The group is thought to have called on Bogachev to collaborate on developing an\nenhanced version of Zeus capable of routing information to the threat actors on the compromised bank accounts,\nand particularly of notifying them when a victim signs in to their online bank account [18]. This version, enhanced\nby use of the XMPP (Extensible messaging and presence protocol) protocol, commonly dubbed Jabber [19], would be\nrenamed JabberZeuS (see Appendix 6.2).\n\nAt the end of 2010, M. Bogachev claimed he was retiring, after reaping nearly USD 100m worth of profits during\nhis five years in operation [20]. The FBI nevertheless published an indictment against M. Bogachev in June 2014,\nwhich would suggest that he continued his malicious operations.\n\nIn May 2011, Zeus’ source code went public. To date, 447 variants of Zeus, associated with 27 families, have been\nidentified [21].\n\nIn September 2011, a variant of ZeuS, Murofet (alias Licat), emerged, allegedly becoming the leading tool leveraged\nby members of the Business Club [17], and was soon after renamed GameOverZeuS (GoZ) (see Appendix ??). In\n2012, the botnet GoZ also distributed the ransomeware Cryptolocker.\n\nIn May 2014, the FBI-led Operation Tovar, supported by the Russian police [20], took down the infrastructure of\nGoZ and Cryptolocker, as well as the P2P network of the GoZ botnet. At the time, this included some 1 million\nbots, and was responsible for fraudulent transactions totalling tens of millions of dollars [18].\n\n#### 2.2 Evil Corp\n\n##### 2.2.1 2014: from JabberZeuS to Evil Corp\n\nThe banking trojan Dridex first appeared on the scene in June 2014[15]. Dridex is v5 of the malware Bugat, which\nsurfaced in 2010, and is manifestly operated (perhaps even developed) by at least one member of the Business Club,\nYakubets and Ghinkul, one of the operators of Troyak, the bulletproof hosting provider[16] (taken down in 2010) of\nBusiness Club [18].\n\nA. Ghinkul (alias Smilex) [10], a Moldovan national, was arrested in August 2015 in Cyprus and extradited to the US\n\n[22], after Dell SecureWorks experts redirected the control points of the botnet Dridex towards a sinkhole[17] server,\nenabling the FBI to dismantle the associated infrastructure and pick him out from among 14 Dridex distributors.\nGhinkul most likely belonged to the team administrating botnet ID 120.\n\n15Two weeks after GOZ was taken down, the banking trojan Dyre also allegedly appeared. In addition to having the same developer as Gozi\nNeverquest, some attacks involving Dyre could be connected to the Business Club. It is quite possible, then, that the group branched out,\nharnessing Dyre to steal money from large business banking accounts, and Dridex to steal money from retail banking accounts. In November\n2015, the arrest of Dyre’s operators led to it becoming completely inactive [18].\n16On the black market, criminals offer servers for hire that are remote from any jurisdiction. These are called bulletproof servers. Once hired\nout, a command centre can be installed in the server.\n17Sinkholing involves redirecting data flow from zombie machines to a server outside the control of malicious operators.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 7 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\n_Comment: it is interesting to note that, following Ghinkul’s arrest, botnet ID 120 was not the only one to become tempo-_\n_rarily inactive: botnet 220 associated with TA505 only resumed operations three months afterwards._\n\nDespite this arrest, the Business Club, henceforth known as Evil Corporation (alias EvilCorp, Indrik Spider), headed\nup by Yakubets, has renewed its infrastructure and remained active.\n\nFig. 2.1 : Mapping of links between Russian-speaking cybercriminal groups, from ZeuS to Evil Corp\n\nIn a joint indictment dated 5 December 2019, the US Department of Justice and Britain’s National Crime Agency\nidentified nine members of the group Evil Corp. In addition to M. Yakubets:\n\n  - I. Turashev allegedly acted as administrator of the malware Dridex and lent technical assistance to its operators;\n\n  - D. Gusev is accused of having materially and financially facilitated Evil Corp, with six Russian-based companies\nfor which he was the General Director receiving sanctions on the part of the US Treasury [23];\n\n17/07/2020 Page 8 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\n  - The six main remaining members of Evil Corp[18] have particularly been identified through posts on social\nmedia [24], most flaunting lavish spending sprees including luxury cars with “BOP” in the number plate\n(pronounced “VOR”, which means “thief” in Russian).\n\nIn addition to Dridex, Blueliv alleges that Evil Corp has also distributed other trojans including (POS malware) [25],\nas well as Carbanak[19] [26]. Evil Corp is most likely made up of two operational teams, each with spammers, i.e.\nindividuals specialising in the distribution of phishing campaigns not only on behalf of Evil Corp but also other\nthreat actor groups [27].\n\n##### 2.2.2 Evil Corp's development since 2017\n\n###### The ransomware BitPaymer\n\nDiscovered in July 2017 [28], the ransomware Bitpaymer (alias FriedEx) first hit the headlines following its attack\nagainst Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), at a Scottish hospital, in August 2017.\n\nBitpaymer is a binary file, which means it cannot be distributed or log in to a C2 server of its own accord. Its operators therefore execute it manually. It has many code similarities with Dridex [28]. Moreover, a lot of attacks leading\nto encryption by the ransomware Bitpaymer have involved prior compromising by Dridex. Such connections suggest that Bitpaymer has been developed and operated by Evil Corp.\n\nBitpaymer represents a change in tactics on the part of Evil Corp, with precedence now given to a small number\nof highly profitable targeted attacks (Big Game Hunting) rather than its massive Dridex schemes run since 2014. In\n2019, it appears that Evil Corp is now using Dridex no longer to commit bank fraud but to conduct recce operations\non the ISs it compromises so as to determine whether or not it is worth distributing Bibpaymer on them [25].\nBitpaymer’s typical infection chain involving Dridex is as follows:\n\nFig. 2.2 : Bitpaymer’s infection chain involving Dridex\n\nThat said, Bitpaymer can also apparently be distributed by Emotet rather than Dridex (which is itself sometimes\ndistributed by Emotet) [29, 30].\n\n18Dmitry Smirnov, Artyom Yakubets, Ivan Tuchkov, Andrey Plotnitsky, Dmitry Slobodskoy and Kirill Slobodskoy.\n19In 2016, there are even reports that Carbanak was sometimes downloaded by Dridex loader within infected ISs.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 9 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\nThe indictment against Yakubets and other members of Evil Corp, published in early December 2019, does not\nseem to have dented the cybercriminal group’s activities much, given the ongoing BitPaymer campaigns.\n\n###### Split within Evil Corp\n\nIn April 2019, Evil Corp is thought to have split into two groups: Indrik Spider and Doppel Spider[20] [31]. While\nIndrik Spider allegedly ran the malware Dridex and Bitpaymer, as had been done since 2018, Doppel Spider purportedly executed a modified version of Dridex, DoppelDridex, as well as a variant of the ransomware BitPaymer,\nDoppelPaymer. In this way, it not only deployed banking fraud campaigns via DoppelDridex only, but also ransomware campaigns via DoppelPaymer.\n\nGiven that:\n\n  - the malware FakeUpdates distributed Dridex in October 2019, and that Dridex deployed either BitPaymer or\nDoppelPaymer within the victims’ ISs [32],\n\n  - during a DoppelPaymer incident, FireEye detected the downloading of Dridex v4 botnet ID 501 (associated\nwith Evil Corp), then of Dridex v2 botnet ID 12333 in a bid to deploy DoppelPaymer (associated with Doppel\nSpider) [32];\n\n  - Doppel Spider uses the services of Emotet [31], as does Evil Corp,\n\nIt would appear that the two groups are continuing to collaborate, or perhaps even that Doppel Spider is a subgroup of Evil Corp.\n\nPHowever, since the first quarter of 2020, what distinguishes the operators behind DoppelPaymer from Bitpaymer’s\noperators is that the former have started to publish the data exfiltrated from the IS of their victims (on the website\nwww.doppleshare[.]top/), in the same way as operators of other ransomware (Maze, Sodinokibi, Clop and Nemty\nin particular) [33].\n\n20Indrik Spider and Doppel Spider are two alias established by Crowdstrike.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 10 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\n### 3 Distribution of Dridex by the main affiliates\n\nThe infection vector comes across as the most discriminating characteristic of the different botnet IDs, and therefore\nof the different affiliates. That said, there is a risk of confusing the affiliate and the distributor chosen by the latter.\nFor example, the operator of a botnet distributing the Dridex of a specific botnet ID must not be confused with the\naffiliate of the botnet ID in question.\n\n#### 3.1 Phishing emails\n\n##### 3.1.1 The botnet CraP2P (alias Necurs)\n\nActive from 2012 to 2020, CraP2P is a botnet specialising in the distribution of phishing campaigns and malware,\non behalf of various threat actor groups. Over this time, the number of bots making it up has risen to nine million.\nAny one of these bots was capable of sending out several million spam emails in the space of a few dozen days [34].\nCraP2P was, for example, used by its operators to distribute GoZ in 2013, Cryptolocker in 2014 and Dridex from at\nleast 2015 [35].\n\nOver the 2015-2016 period, CraP2P was behind phishing campaigns particularly delivering Dridex botnets, ID 120,\n122, 123, 220, 223 and 301. Whereas botnet ID 120 was associated with A. Ghinkhul until the middle of 2015, botnets 220 and 223 have been associated with TA505 [36].\n\nAccording to Proofpoint [37], the cybercriminal group TA505 began using Dridex in July 2014, so a month after it\nwas designed (June 2014). TA505 made fairly intermittent use of Dridex until June 2016 then completely stopped\nusing it in June 2017. The botnet IDs used by TA505 between 2014 and 2015 to deploy Dridex are most likely 125,\n220 (targeting the UK, France and Australia) and 223 (targeting Germany and Austria). TA505 reportedly then used\nbotnets, ID 7200 and 7500 (probably in 2017).\n\n_Comment: Because TA505 used one of the three most active botnet IDs of the Dridex network (ID 220), it could have been_\n_confused with Evil Corp, whereas it was ultimately no more than a particularly engaged affiliate of the P2P network, and_\n_therefore, in effect, in close collaboration with Evil Corp._\n\nIt thus appears that the operators of CraP2P were working closely with Evil Corp and some of its affiliates in terms\nof distribution, which resulted from past collaboration with GoZ.\n\n_Comment: Some sources indicate that Evil Corp could be the operator of the CraP2P botnet, while others claim that this_\n_could be TA505. Without further evidence, it is only possible to confirm a close relationship between these different groups._\n\n##### 3.1.2 The botnet Cutwail\n\nTA544 (alias Narwhal Spider) is a cybercriminal service provider believed to make the botnet Cutwail available for\nhire on Russian-speaking underground forums[21] [38].\n\nOver the period it was active, GoZ rented access to part of the infrastructure of the botnet Cutwail to distribute\nphishing emails [39]. Its supposed successor, Evil Corp, is also thought to have called on the services of TA544 [40].\n\nIn 2019, the botnet Cutwail was distributing Dridex ID 1044 via phishing campaigns [41], primarily targeted at the\nUnited States, Canada and Australia. At least once in November 2019, the infection chain purportedly did not stop\nat Dridex, since the latter propagated the ransomware Hermès [22] [15].\n\n_Comment: It is not easy to tell whether TA544 is an affiliate of Dridex, or whether part of the botnet it operates is used by_\n_Evil Corp or one of its affiliates to distribute Dridex, making TA544 a distributor only._\n\n21Botnet founded in 2007: GameOver ZeuS was apparently a customer in 2012.\n22Used by Lazarus during the attack against the Far Eastern International Bank, Hermès is a ransomware that can be purchased on the Dark\nWeb.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 11 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\nFig. 3.1 : Distribution of Dridex via the botnets CraP2P and Cutwail\n\n##### 3.1.3 The botnet Andromeda\n\nBefore it was taken down in 2017, the botnet Andromeda (alias Gamarue) was tasked with distributing Dridex,\nparticularly with the UK as a target in 2016 [13].\n\n#### 3.2 As a second payload\n\nBy Trend Micro’s reckoning, the operators of Emotet, Gozi ISFB (alias Ursnif)[23] and Dridex likely share the same\nPE[24] _loader[25], provider, and perhaps even exchange resources [29]._\n\nEmotet[26] has been able to propagate Dridex since at least 2017 [43]. Emotet has even been known to distribute\nBitpaymer, the ransomware exclusively used by Evil Corp. The first connections between Emotet and the operators\nof Dridex, Evil Corp, were found in April 2017 [44].\n\n_Comment: Evil Corp appears to call on the operators of Emotet (Mummy Spider, Mealybug, TA542) to deliver Dridex as_\n_a second payload within the IS that they have already compromised. The operators of TrickBot (Wizard Spider) have the_\n_same modus operandi._\n\nRegarding Gozi ISFB, TA551 (alias Shathak) used its loader RM3[45] to distribute Dridex botnets, ID 301, 302, 303,\n3101 and 35001, in 2018 and 2019 [15, 46] across the US, Canada and Italy. During these same infection chains, Gozi\nv2 RM3 has sometimes been accompanied by the credential-stealing malware Predator the Thief [27] or ransomware\nGandCrab (occurrences in December 2018)[28].\n\n23The original banking trojan horse Gozi was developed in 2006 as a competitor of the trojan horse ZeuS. The source code for Gozi leaked in\n2010 and was co-opted by other cybercriminal groups to create other trojans, including Gozi ISFB, Vawtrak (Neverquest) and GozNim, a\ncombination of Gozi IFSB and Nymain [16]. Version 2.13.24.1 of Gozi ISFB leaked in February 2015.\n24Format of executable files and libraries on Windows operating systems, including .EXE (for programs) and .DLL (for libraries).\n25The PE loader enables Windows to perform the instructions of a PE file.\n26Banking trojan horse that surfaced in 2014, and became a loader of such malware families as TrickBot, Gootkit and IcedID from 2017. The\noperators of Emotet allow other cybercriminal groups to rent access to the workstations they have infected [42, 29].\n27Malware sold on the Dark Web in June 2018.\n28GandCrab may well have also been deployed at the end of 2018 during infection chains involving Dridex botnet ID 10202 and TA547, identified\nby Proofpoint as the operator of the banking trojan Danabot [47].\n\n17/07/2020 Page 12 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\nFig. 3.2 : Distribution of Dridex as a second payload of Emotet and Gozi ISFB\n\n#### 3.3 Watering hole\n\nSince 2019, Dridex v4 botnets, ID 199 and 501, are thought to be distributed via FakeUpdates (alias SocGholish)[29].\nWatering hole attacks, or phishing emails pointing to a malicious URL, entail the display of a false browser update\nwhere the malware FakeUpdates would be installed followed by the propagation of Dridex and BitPaymer or DoppelPaymer [32]. Spanish IT service provider Everis System fell victim to one of these attacks in November 2019 [25].\nIn the case of DoppelPaymer, Dridex ID 12333 was reportedly downloaded on the IS after the latter was infected\nby Dridex v4 botnets, ID 199 or 501.\n\n_Comment: Logically, Dridex ID 12333 would thus be associated with Doppel Spider. Such would also be case for Dridex_\n_ID 40300._\n\nFig. 3.3 : Dridex infection chain via FakeUpdates\n\n29Dridex botnet ID 11122 was purportedly distributed in the same way in 2018.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 13 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\nThese campaigns deliver, in turn, Dridex v4 botnets, ID 199 or 501, AZORult, Chthonic[30] and NetSupport RAT[31],\nillustrating the fact that Evil Corp calls on the operator of FakeUpdates, in the same way as other cybercriminal\ngroups, in order to distribute Dridex then BitPaymer.\n\n#### 3.4 Exploit kits\n\nIn June 2019, the exploit kit Spelevo[32] delivered Dridex, as well as between September and November, concomitantly with the exploit kit Fallout [15], via compromised websites [52].\n\nThe exploit kit Fallout is thought to be the favourite infection vector of the affiliate corresponding to the botnet ID\n10111, while the botnet ID 30102 tends to use the exploit kit Spelevo.\n\n30Banking trojan resulting from the trojan ZeusVM, itself a variant of ZeuS, whose builder binary code leaked in June 2015 [48, 49], and itself based on the malware Zeus, whose source code leaked in 2011. Chthonic has been designed similar to Dridex with a module-based architecture,\nand shares three of its modules (Pony, SOCKS and VNC) [50].\n31Legitimate remote access tool [51].\n32This exploit kit is also known to have distributed the ransomware Maze.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 14 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\n### 4 Conclusion\n\nThe malware Dridex illustrates just how complicated it is to attribute attacks on account of the plethora of interconnected groups inhabiting the Russian-speaking cybercriminal ecosystem (providers, customers, botnet operators,\netc.). Dridex has a manifold background (Bugat, GoZ), operators from myriad groups (Rock Gang, Avalanche, JabberZeuS), just like its affiliates, and is distributed via many different infection vectors, against a wide array of targets\nall over the world.\n\nHowever, the string of indictments that have built up over the past decade against members of Evil Corp has helped\nto better pinpoint the group’s activities, connecting individuals to cyberattacks and malware.\n\nBe that as it may, Dridex remains a threat in the hands of Evil Corp, Doppel Spider and their current affiliates in\nparticular, in the context of more targeted campaigns aimed at spreading ransomware.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 15 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\n### 5 Methods of

malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\n### 6 Appendices\n\n#### 6.1 Appendix 1: Characteristics of the malware package ZeuS\n\nZeuS serves two key purposes:\n\n  - it turns its victims into zombie machines of the botnet bearing the same name;\n\n  - it can tell when its victim is signed into a bank’s website and harvests the latter’s account access codes. This\nenables its operators to transfer money from the victims’ accounts to the accounts controlled by mules.\n\nIts main functions are as follows [53] :\n\n  - targeted information theft: for example, in 2007 ZeuS stole information from the US Department of Transportation (the United States is its number one target [54];\n\n  - remote access via the VNC protocol;\n\n  - program downloading and running[33];\n\n  - deletion of key components for the functioning of the operating system in a bid to destroy the infected machine.\n\n_Comment: The trojan Zeus would thus have been capable of sabotaging ISs, in the same way as Dridex through its_\n_module KillOS._\n\n#### 6.2 Appendix 2: JabberZeuS\n\nThe Business Club all began with the cybercriminal group Rock Gang, which operated from 2004 to 2008, and\nwhose members were of Ukrainian, Russian, Romanian and Moldovan nationality [18]. In 2008, lots of Rock Gang’s\nmembers reportedly began to use Avalanche, an extensive global network hosting infrastructure harnessed by different groups of cybercriminals [55]. Among them, some, united within the Business Club, allegedly called on M.\nBogachev to help develop an enhanced version of ZeuS: JabberZeuS.\n\nThe new group formed around JabberZeuS includes some fifty individuals, whose privileges stem from their seniority and who work across several activities:\n\n  - fraud: to participate in fraud activities, membership fees must be paid and a profit-sharing agreement signed;\n\n  - recruitment of mules: some mules were located in two Chinese cities, adjacent to the Russian border, north of\nVladivostok [17]. In September 2010, the network of British JabberZeuS mules was arrested during Operation\nTrident breACH[34] [18];\n\n  - technical support;\n\n  - provision of services: the group sold access to ZeuS (for USD 3,000 or 4,000 [20], not including modules) and to\nother trojans. Accordingly, in October 2010, the FBI, collaborating with its British and Ukrainian counterparts,\ndismantled a network of a dozen or so cybercriminals which had leveraged the malware Zeus to target US\nbank accounts and siphoned around USD 70m off them [56, 57].\n\nIdentified group members include M. Bogachev, M. Yakubets (particularly in charge of recruiting mules), Y. Penchukov (alias tank), I. Klepikov (alias petr0vich), A. Bron (alias thehead), Y. Kulibaba (alias jonni), Y. Konovalenko\n(alias jtk0) and A. Tikonov (alias kusanagi) [58]. The latter is believed to have developed Leprechaun, a system for\nautomating fraudulent transactions on Internet banking platforms, used by JabberZeuS. This system particularly\n\n33Function generally used by affiliates of the botnet ZeuS, which also propagated other malware as a second payload in order to ramp up their\nearnings.\n34ACH refers to unauthorised fund transfers occurring in bank accounts.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 18 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\nmakes it possible to alter a victim’s banking transactions in real time [18]. Brian Krebs35 has identified disagreements within the group between M. Yakubets and M. Bogachev[35] [59].\n\n#### 6.3 Appendix 3: GameOverZeuS\n\nThe group built a structure of botnets operating in P2P, via GameOverZeuS and modelled on the ZeuS botnet.\nThis structure had 27 botnets, whose C2 backends were each controlled by a different person or group, operating\nalongside other malware. Most of these botnets already existed and simply migrated towards the P2P of GoZ when\nit was designed. In this way, GoZ infiltrated computers that had already been infected by JabberZeuS [18].\n\nGoZ included an automated fund transfer system, similar to Leprechaun, called The World Bank Center [18].\n\nNot only that, but the threat actor group was a customer of the same bullet proof hoster (Troyak) for server use as\nthe Rock Gang and operators of Avalanche and Gozi, and rented access to part of the infrastructure of the botnet\nCutwail to distribute phishing emails. They also used the exploit kit BlackHole[36] which distributed Pony Loader so\nas to install the payload GameOver ZeuS, as well as the kit Dirt Jumper in a bid to launch DDoS attacks on banks’\nwebsites and so create a diversion from their fraudulent transfer operations [39].\n\n#### 6.4 Appendix 4: On the links between Dridex and Cridex\n\nThe similarity in names and behaviour between the malware families Dridex and Cridex has long led to the belief\nthat they could have been designed by the same developers. This does not seem to be the case in reality, however.\n\nOn 10 December 2015, the account DridexBOT appeared on the Twitter network [60], most likely registered using\nthe email address dridex[@]mail.ru created specifically for the occasion.\n\nAlthough this account behaves like a bot, its tweets are actually written by one or more individuals as can be\ninferred from its many interactions with accounts of users close to the world of cybersecurity, particularly the\nblog MalwareTech, which would authenticate the account on 4 April 2016 [61]. Between December 2015 and 14\nApril 2017, the date of its last tweet, DridexBOT posted 153 messages, frequently aimed at demonstrating the nonexistence of links between its source code and those of the Cridex family (Feodo, Geodo, etc.) [62, 63, 64].\n\nFig. 6.1 : Tweets by DridexBOT\n\nFinally, it was keen to underline Dridex’ interest for sectors other than banking, not least industrial espionage [65].\n\n35During a chat, M. Yakubets agreed with these words from one of the members of JabberZeuS about M. Bogachev: ”he, fucker, annoyed the\nhell out of everyone, doesn’t want to write bypass of interactives and trojan penetration 35-40%, bitch”.\n36Also used to deploy the variants of ZeuS Bugat, Feodo and Cridex, as well as the banking trojan horses Mebroot and Torpig.\n\n17/07/2020 Page 19 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex: origins and uses\n\nFig. 6.2 : Tweet de DridexBOT\n\n17/07/2020 Page 20 sur 24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware Dridex : origins and uses\n\n### 7 Bibliographie\n\n[1] [ASSISTE.
