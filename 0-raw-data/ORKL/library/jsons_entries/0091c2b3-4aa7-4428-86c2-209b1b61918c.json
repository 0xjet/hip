The application is configured to communicate with\nHamas’s Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades website — alqassam[.]ps. The website has worked\nintermittently since the start of Hamas’s ground incursion into Israeli territory on October 7, 2023. From\nOctober 11, 2023, onward, we observed the domain point to multiple different IP addresses, which is\nlikely related to attempts to evade website takedowns or, potentially, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n\nInfrastructure analysis associated with alqassam[.]ps led to the identification of a cluster of domains\nthat mimic the domain registration tradecraft of TAG-63 (AridViper, APT-C-23, Desert Falcon), a cyber\ngroup that we believe operates at the behest of the Hamas terrorist organization. We also observed\nthat these domains were interconnected via a Google Analytics code. The domains were also\nconfigured to redirect to alqassam[.]ps.\n\nLast but not least, a domain associated with the cluster hosted a website that spoofs the World\nOrganization Against Torture (OMCT). Again, based on domain registration patterns, we observed a\nlikely Iran nexus tied to that domain.\n\nRecorded Future Network Intelligence revealed a significant uptick in network traffic to the IP addresses\nhosting alqassam[.]ps, which overlapped with the start of Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, as well\nas a significant reduction in traffic by late on October 10 (all times in this report are in UTC). This is\npotentially due to website outages or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks directed at the website by third\nparties.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - The application dropped in a Telegram Channel claiming affiliation to Hamas’s Izz ad-Din\nal-Qassam Brigades was designed to enhance the dissemination of the organization's message\nvia that application.\n\n  - Multiple domains identified through Insikt Group infrastructure research revealed that they\nshared a specific Google Analytics code; various domains were also identified redirecting to the\nIzz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades website.\n\n  - We observed domain registration tradecraft commonly associated with TAG-63, which shared\nthe website redirect to the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades website.\n\n  - Our analysis suggests that infrastructure likely operated by the same threat actors revealed an\nIran nexus based on subdomain naming registration conventions. One of the subdomains\nassociated with this cluster hosted a spoofed page associated with the World Organization\nAgainst Torture.\n\n  - Recorded Future Network Intelligence observed an influx of network traffic to IP addresses\nhosting the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades website at the start of Hamas’s incursion into Israeli\nterritory on October 7, 2023.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Analysis\n\n\n#### The Al Qassam Application\n\n\nThe Al Qassam application was posted on October 10, 2023, via a Telegram Channel called1\n\n\n##### \"القسام الدين عز الشهيد كتائب\" (Martyr Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades) (Figure 1), where it was disseminated\nto be shared with the group's membership base.\n\n**Figure 1: The application was advertised on the Telegram Channel of the Qassam Brigade on October 10, 2023. The statement**\nreads: \"Download now the trial version of the ‘Al-Qassam Media’ application for ‘Android’ devices, so you can follow the news of\n\n\nthe Martyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades\". (Source: Telegram)\n\n\nThe application is configured to communicate with the domain that acts as an outlet for the Qassam\nBrigade — alqassam[.]ps — which, at the time of this analysis, resolved to the IP address 5.45.81[.]22\nand is owned by a Panamanian entity called \"IROKO Networks Corporation\" (AS12722). We observed\nthe domain point to multiple different IP addresses from October 11, 2023, onward (Table 1).\n\n1 https[:]//t[.]me/qassambrigades/28465\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: The application has direct links to the website of the Hamas organization (Source: Telegram)**\n\n\nThe domain — alqassam[.]ps — resolved to 176.114.6[.]214 from May 2021 until October 11, 2023. On\nOctober 11, the domain changed its resolution to 185.209.31[.]193, an IP address owned by a Russian\nentity, \"VDSINA VDS Hosting\" (AS48282).
