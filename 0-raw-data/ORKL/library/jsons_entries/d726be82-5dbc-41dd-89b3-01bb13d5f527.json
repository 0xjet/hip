(Accellion) to perform a security assessment of Accellion's File Transfer\nAppliance (FTA) software, in the wake of two related but distinct exploits used to attack client Accellion FTA\nsystems—one that was discovered and addressed by Accellion in December 2020 (the “December Exploit”), and\nanother that was discovered and addressed by Accellion in January 2021 (the “January Exploit”) (collectively, the\n“Exploits”).\n\nThe objectives of Mandiant’s security assessment included:\n\n  - Independently identifying the security vulnerabilities used in the attack activity, based on review of\ncompromised Accellion FTA instances\n\n  - Validating the patches that Accellion issued for the vulnerabilities\n\n  - Testing FTA version 9.12.432 (current as of the time of Mandiant testing) for further vulnerabilities in the\nsoftware\n\nThis assessment was performed between February 4, 2021 and February 26, 2021.\n\n#### Summary of Results\n\nAccellion identified two zero-day vulnerabilities that were part of the December Exploit—CVE-2021-27101 and\nCVE-2021-27104—and two zero-day vulnerabilities that were part of the January Exploit—CVE-2021-27102 and\nCVE-2021-27103. Based on Mandiant’s own forensic analysis of a sample of compromised Accellion FTA\ninstances—which were provided to Mandiant by Accellion as well as impacted Accellion customers (in\ninvestigations Mandiant conducted directly for those customers), Mandiant confirmed that the attacker activity\nexploited these vulnerabilities (the “Exploited Vulnerabilities”). Mandiant did not identify any additional\nvulnerabilities that were exploited by the attackers.[1] Mandiant also validated the efficacy of the patches Accellion\nreleased to address the Exploited Vulnerabilities, which Accellion made available to FTA customers soon after\neach Exploit was identified.\n\nThe Exploited Vulnerabilities were of critical severity because they were subject to exploitation via\nunauthenticated remote code execution. Through its source code analysis and penetration testing, Mandiant did\nnot identify any new such unauthenticated remote code-execution vulnerabilities. Mandiant did identify two\npreviously unknown authenticated-user vulnerabilities: (1) Argument Injection (CVE-2021-27730), accessible to\nauthenticated users with administrative privileges; and (2) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2021-27731),\naccessible to regular authenticated users. The Argument Injection finding yielded a Common Vulnerability Scoring\nSystem (CVSS v3.0) score of 6.6 (medium severity) and the Stored Cross-Site Scripting finding was rated 8.1\n(high severity). Accellion has developed a patch for these two vulnerabilities (FTA 9.12.444), which Mandiant has\nvalidated.\n\n#### Project Scope\n\n_Accellion FTA Vulnerability Identification: Mandiant reviewed the source code for Accellion FTA versions 9.12.370_\nthrough 9.12.432, as well as a sample of ten (10) forensic images from affected Accellion FTA instances, in order\nto identify the vulnerabilities involved in the attack activity and to test for additional vulnerabilities. This review\ninvolved the following methods:\n\n1 As explained in a separate blog post, Mandiant has attributed the attack activity on FTA systems to two\nuncategorized threat groups—one that is believed to be responsible for compromising the systems (UNC2546),\nand another that is believed to be responsible for engaging in extortion activity with respect to a subset of the\ncompromised customers (UNC2582).\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Source code analysis\n2. Dynamic penetration testing of Accellion FTA\n3. Forensic analysis of compromised Accellion FTA appliances\n\n_Accellion FTA Patch Validation: Mandiant reviewed the Accellion FTA product version 9.12.432 (current as of the_\ntime of Mandiant’s review) to validate that the version mitigated the Exploited Vulnerabilities. Mandiant then\nattempted variations of exploits to determine if the 9.12.432 version of Accellion FTA could be exploited using\nvariations of the known attack vectors. The following areas were reviewed during this portion of the assessment:\n\n1. Attempting alternative variations of the previously identified exploits\n2. Attempting to exploit web pages and web services application programming interfaces (SOAP APIs)\n\nnot used by attackers\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThis section describes the scope and technical details for this assessment.\n\n\n#### Timeline of Events\n\nBelow is a timeline of the relevant events, starting with the first detection of anomalous activity, up to the latest\nAccellion FTA patch pushed to customers.\n\n\n**Exploit** **•** Dec. 16, 2020: First known use of December Exploit: exploit trips FTA’s\nbuilt-in anomaly detector on customer’s device\n\n**Investigation** **•** Dec. 16, 2020: Customer notifies Accellion that its anomaly detector was\ntriggered\n\n\n**Investigation** **•** Dec. 16-19, 2020: Accellion investigates and identifies vulnerabilities affecting\nFTA 9.12.370 – SQL Injection (CVE-2021-27101) and OS\nCommand Execution (CVE-2021-27104)\n\n**Mitigation** **•** Dec. 20, 2020: Accellion releases patch FTA 9.12.380, which remediates\nCVE-2021-27101 and CVE-2021-27104\n\n\n**Mitigation** **•** Dec. 23, 2020: Accellion releases patch FTA 9.12.411, increasing\nanomaly detector checks from one per day to one per hour\n\n**Exploit** **•** Jan. 20, 2021: First known use of January Exploit (unknown to Accellion\nat the time)\n\n\n**Exploit** **•** Jan. 22, 2021: Through multiple customer service inquiries, Accellion\nlearns of anomalous activity indicative of new exploit\n\n**Mitigation** **•** Jan. 22, 2021: Accellion issues critical security alert advising FTA\ncustomers to shut down their FTA systems immediately\n\n\n**Mitigation** **•** Jan. 22-25, 2021: Accellion investigates and identifies Server-Side Request\nForgery (CVE-2021-27103) and OS Command Execution\n(CVE-2021-27102) vulnerabilities\n\n**Mitigation** **•** Jan. 25, 2021: Accellion releases patch FTA 9.12.416, which remediates\nCVE-2021-27102 and CVE-2021-27103\n\n**Mitigation** **•** Jan. 28, 2021: Accellion releases patch FTA_9.12.432, increasing\nfrequency of anomaly detector checks to every 10 minutes\n\n\n**Review** **•** Feb. 4, 2021: Mandiant begins security assessment\n\n**Review** **•** Feb. 28, 2021: Mandiant concludes assessment, identifying two new\nfindings – Argument Injection (CVE-2021-27730) and\nStored XSS (CVE-2021-27731)\n\n\n**Mitigation** **•** Mar. 1, 2021: Accellion releases patch FTA 9.12.444, addressing CVE2021-27730 and CVE-2021-27731\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Forensic Analysis\n\n##### Materials Reviewed\n\nIn analyzing the Exploited Vulnerabilities previously identified by Accellion – SQL Injection (CVE-2021-27101),\nServer-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CVE-2021-27103), and OS Command Execution (CVE-2021-27102, CVE2021-27104) – Mandiant had access to and reviewed forensic images from ten (10) affected Accellion FTA\ninstances. The majority of the instances reflected activity associated with the December Exploit, while the others\nreflected activity associated with the January Exploit. Based on Mandiant’s experience, the activity observed on\nthese instances is likely to be representative of attacker activity on other affected instances not reviewed by\nMandiant, given the repetitive, script-like execution of the activity observed. In some cases, in addition to the FTA\ninstances themselves, Mandiant had access to firewall logs from the networks the FTA appliances were hosted\non, which allowed Mandiant to identify additional evidence of attacker activity based on known attacker IP\naddresses.\n\n##### How the Attack Operated\n\n**December Exploit**\n\nWith respect to the December Exploit, Mandiant observed that the attacker chained together the following\nvulnerabilities: SQL Injection (CVE-2021-27101) and OS Command Execution (CVE-2021-27104). The attacker\nleveraged the SQL Injection vulnerability against the file document_root.html to retrieve “W” keys from the\nAccellion FTA database. These keys were then used to generate valid tokens that allowed the attacker to then\nmake additional requests to a file named sftp_account_edit.php. While abusing the OS Command Execution\nvulnerability in this file, the attackers were able to execute their own commands, resulting in the creation of a web\nshell[2] written to /home/seos/courier/oauth.api.\n\nThe attacker likely used the newly created oauth.api web shell to upload a custom, more full-fledged web shell\nwith the filename of about.html (variant 1) to disk, which included highly customized tooling designed to facilitate\nexfiltration of data from the FTA system. While the timing of the requests resulting in the generation of this second\nweb shell suggests that it was delivered via the oauth.api web shell, the available evidence does not indicate\nthe exact mechanism used to write it to disk. For threat-tracking purposes, Mandiant has labeled this second web\nshell as “DEWMODE”.\n\nThe DEWMODE web shell extracts a list of available files from a MySQL database on the targeted Accellion FTA\nsystem and lists those files and corresponding metadata (file ID, path, filename, uploader, and recipient) on an\nHTML page. File download requests are captured in the web logs for the Accellion FTA system, which will contain\nrequests to the DEWMODE web shell with encrypted and encoded URL parameters, where dwn is the file path\nand fn is the requested file name. The DEWMODE webshell has features that allow the attacker to delete the\nAccellion FTA web logs. Forensic analysts may need to recover these logs from slack space for analysis.\n\nThe uploading of the DEWMODE web shell to the file location where the attacker placed it had the effect (likely\nunanticipated by and unknown to the attacker) of tripping the built-in anomaly detector included in the FTA\nsoftware. Once the anomaly detector is tripped, it generates an email alert to the customer (specifically to the\nadmin email account designated by the customer), advising the customer to contact Accellion for support. As a\nresult, any FTA customer affected by the December Exploit likely was sent such an email – which, per Accellion,\nis how the December Exploit came to its attention (see above Timeline).\n\n2 A web shell is a script that can be uploaded to a web server to enable remote execution of commands.\n\n\n-----\n\n**January Exploit**\n\nMandiant observed that, after the December 20, 2020 release of patch 9.12.380, which remediated the\nvulnerabilities associated with the December Exploit, the attacker pivoted to a new technique involving ServerSide Request Forgery (SSRF) (CVE-2021-27103) and OS Command Execution (CVE-2021-27102).\n\nThe attacker chained together an SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2021-27103) with a Command Execution vulnerability\n(CVE-2021-27102) to execute commands on the system. Specifically, the attacker leveraged the SSRF\nvulnerability against the file wmProgressstat.html to reach a local SOAP web service located in the file\n```\nsw_update.php, which would not otherwise be accessible from the Internet. Once access was established with\n\n```\nthe file sw_update.php, the attacker abused the OS Command Execution vulnerability in this file to create other\nmalicious files, including another about.html (variant 2) DEWMODE web shell used to further the remainder of\ntheir attack.\n\nNotably, in the case of this second exploit, the attacker uploaded the DEWMODE web shell to a different location\n(/home/httpd/html/about.html), likely to avoid FTA’s built-in anomaly detector. The earliest evidence we\nhave seen of this change in tactic appears on January 20, 2020.\n\n**Both Exploits**\n\nBoth the December Exploit and the January Exploit demonstrate a high level of sophistication and deep familiarity\nwith the inner workings of the Accellion FTA software, likely obtained through extensive reverse engineering of\nthe software. Among the things the attacker had to know were:\n\n  - How to call internal APIs to obtain keys to decrypt filenames\n\n  - How to forge tokens for internal API calls\n\n  - How to chain together the vulnerabilities involved to conduct unauthenticated remote code execution\n\n  - How to navigate FTA’s internal database, requiring a detailed understanding of the database structure\n\n  - How to bypass FTA’s built-in anomaly detector (in the case of the January Exploit)\n\n##### Indicators of Compromise\n\nBased on Mandiant’s review of the logs and images available for analysis, the attacker activity generated the\nfollowing signatures for each affected customer, all of which should be considered as signs of potential\ncompromise:\n\n**December Exploit**\n\nThe December Exploit, which leveraged SQL Injection (CVE-2021-27101) and OS Command Execution (CVE2021-27104), yielded Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) of the following files with their respective directories:\n\n  - `/home/seos/courier/about.html (DEWMODE)`\n\n  - `/home/seos/courier/httpd.pid`\n\n  - `/home/seos/courier/oauth.api`\n\n  - `/home/seos/courier/DF`\n\n  - `/tmp/.out`\n\n  - `/tmp/.scr`\n\n  - `/home/seos/courier/cache.jz.gz`\n\nAs noted above, the attacker activity tripped FTA’s anomaly detector, causing an alert to be sent to the\nadministrator of the affected customer’s application.\n\nDuring the cleanup routine, the attacker passed a specific query parameter named csrftoken with the\nvalue 11454bd782bb41db213d415e10a0fb3c to DEWMODE. This would cause the following actions:\n\n  - A shell script is written to /tmp/.scr, which will:\n\n\n-----\n\n      - Remove all references to about.html from log files located in /var/opt/apache/\n\n      - Write the modified log file to /tmp/x then attempt to replace the original log file\nat /var/opt/apache/\n\n      - Delete the contents of the /home/seos/log/adminpl.log log file\n\n      - Remove /home/seos/courier/about.html (DEWMODE)\nand /home/seos/courier/oauth.api (eval web shell), and redirect command output to the\nfile /tmp/.out\n\n      - Change the permissions of the output file to be readable, writeable and executable by all users,\nand set the owner to “nobody”\n\n  - Delete the script file /tmp/.scr and other temporarily created files to assist in cleanup\n\n  - Display cleanup output to the requesting user\n\n**January Exploit**\n\nThe January Exploit, which leveraged Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CVE-2021-27102) and OS\nCommand Execution (CVE-2021-27103), yielded IOCs of the following files with their respective directories:\n\n  - `/home/httpd/html/about.html (DEWMODE)`\n\n  - `/home/httpd/html/httpd.pid`\n\n  - `/home/httpd/html/oauth.api`\n\n  - `/home/httpd/html/DF`\n\n  - `/tmp/.out`\n\n  - `/tmp/.scr`\n\n  - `/home/httpd/html/cache.jz.gz`\n\nThe variant instance of DEWMODE used in the January Exploit (bdfd11b1b092b7c61ce5f02ffc5ad55a) had a\nslightly modified cleanup routine, which included wiping of /var/log/secure and\nremoving about.html and oauth.api from the directories /home/httpd/html/ instead\nof /home/seos/courier/.\n\nDuring the cleanup routine, the attacker removed all references of the about.html webshell from systems’\n```\n/var/opt/apache log files, cleared the /home/seos/log/adminpl.log file, removed files from the\n/home/httpd/html directory, and cleared the /var/log/secure log file. This variant of about.html and the\n\n```\nanti-forensic script appear to be an improvement of the earlier variant of about.html, which failed to clear the\n```\n/var/log/secure log file where previous versions of the anti-forensic script were recorded. Mandiant did identify\n\n```\nevidence of the anti-forensic script execution within rolled versions of the /var/log/secure log file.\n\n#### Validation of Accellion’s Remediation of the Exploited Vulnerabilities\n\nAs reflected in the Timeline section, Accellion issued a patch addressing the vulnerabilities associated with the\nDecember Exploit on December 20, 2020 (four days after it started investigating anomalous activity associated\nwith the exploit), and a patch addressing the vulnerabilities associated with the January Exploit on January 25,\n2021 (three days after it started investigating anomalous activity associated with the exploit, having advised all\nFTA customers to shut down their FTA instances in the interim).\n\nAccellion asked Mandiant to confirm that the patches successfully closed these Exploited Vulnerabilities, and that\nno other vulnerabilities were exploited as part of the attack activity. Mandiant’s analysis confirmed both points.\n\nMandiant performed patch validation of Accellion FTA 9.12.432 (which includes the December 20 and January 22\npatches) to validate that the latest version of Accellion FTA mitigates each of the four Exploited Vulnerabilities. As\n\n\n-----\n\npart of this review, Mandiant reviewed the source code in both versions 9.12.370 (pre-dating both the December\n20 and January 22 patches) and 9.12.432 to confirm that the changes completely mitigated the Exploited\nVulnerabilities.\n\nMandiant also tested variations of the exploit techniques involved in the Exploits to ensure that Accellion’s\nimplementation of input validation and sanitization could not be bypassed. This component of the assessment\nincluded attempting alternative variations of the Exploits, as well as attempting to exploit web pages and SOAP\nAPIs not initially used by attackers.\n\nBased on these analyses, Mandiant confirmed that the patches issued by Accellion fully resolved the Exploited\nVulnerabilities, as shown in the table below.\n\n**Identified Exploits** **CVE** **Affected Scope** **Status**\n\nSQL Injection CVE-2021-27101 document_root.html Remediated\n\nCommand Injection CVE-2021-27104 Multiple administrative API Remediated\nendpoints[3]\n\nServer-Side Request CVE-2021-27103 wmProgressstat.html Remediated\nForgery\n\nCommand Injection CVE-2021-27102 sw_update.php Remediated\n\nMandiant also confirmed through forensic analysis of compromised Accellion FTA instances that the only\nvulnerabilities exploited in the attacker activity on the devices were the Exploited Vulnerabilities. Mandiant did not\nidentify additional vulnerabilities that were part of the attacker activity.\n\n#### Testing FTA for Additional Vulnerabilities\n\n**Objectives and Methodology**\n\nAccellion also asked Mandiant to review the Accellion FTA software for any other vulnerabilities Mandiant was\nable to find, beyond the Exploited Vulnerabilities. Specifically, Mandiant reviewed the versions of the software\ndating from December 16, 2020 to the time of Mandiant’s review, including:\n\n  - 9.12.370\n\n  - 9.12.380\n\n  - 9.12.411\n\n  - 9.12.416\n\n  - 9.12.432\n\nMandiant’s review relied on both source code analysis and dynamic penetration testing:\n\n  - Source code analysis: Mandiant was provided a copy of unobfuscated source code by Accellion.\nMandiant was also provided a list of unauthenticated endpoints provided by Accellion to prioritize.\nMandiant reviewed the source code using manual techniques and did not rely on automated source code\nreview tools.\n\n3 An API endpoint can be a URL of a webpage or web service.\n\n|Identified Exploits|CVE|Affected Scope Status|\n|---|---|---|\n|SQL Injection CVE-2021-27101 document_root.html Remediated Command Injection CVE-2021-27104 Multiple administrative API Remediated endpoints3|||\n|Server-Side Request CVE-2021-27103 wmProgressstat.html Remediated Forgery Command Injection CVE-2021-27102 sw_update.php Remediated|||\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Dynamic penetration testing: The focus of the dynamic penetration testing phase of the assessment was\nto identify vulnerabilities by directly interacting with the Accellion FTA software. To facilitate this testing,\nMandiant primarily used Burp Suite Professional (“Burp Suite”), a multifunction web proxy. Mandiant\nbegan the assessment by prioritizing analysis of endpoints that did not require authentication.\n\nMandiant began to review the files corresponding to endpoints, looking for insecure usage of functions that accept\ninput from an untrusted source. This methodology is referred to as “taint analysis,” as it involves identifying\npotentially insecure functions where an untrusted user input is being supplied. Mandiant analyzed each result\nfrom such inputs to determine if any vulnerabilities were surfaced. As a result of this analysis, Mandiant identified\na Stored XSS vulnerability (CVE-2021-27731) resulting from lack of input validation or sanitization.\n\nMandiant continued this analysis by manually searching for sensitive or insecure PHP built-in functions that\naccepted untrusted input. Mandiant searched for insecure functions by referencing various documentation on the\nInternet detailing functions which have been historically exploited. In addition, Mandiant searched for additional\ninstances of the functions exploited as part of the Exploited Vulnerabilities, to ensure untrusted inputs were not\nbeing provided to these functions. As a result of Mandiant’s analysis of application endpoints accessible only to\nan administrator, Mandiant observed application endpoints calling a local Perl script named admin.pl.\nSpecifically, Mandiant searched for usage of the insecure PHP functions escapeshellargs and\n```\nescapeshellcmd used in conjunction with this function. After triaging the output, Mandiant identified a single API\n\n```\nendpoint that did not properly sanitize user input, allowing Mandiant to inject an argument when calling the\n```\nadmin.pl script (CVE2021-27730). \n\n```\nMandiant then proceeded to review the source code of each file corresponding to application API endpoints. This\nwas necessary as the majority of these application endpoints were not accessible from the application user\ninterface. In instances where functionality potentially of use to an attacker was identified, Mandiant attempted to\ncraft requests and manipulate inputs to probe for vulnerabilities and observe the application’s behavior.\nSpecifically, Mandiant searched for functionality potentially susceptible to injection-based issues allowing for\nremote code execution or unauthorized access to data stored within the SQL database or on the remote file\nsystem. Mandiant did not identify any vulnerabilities as a result of this analysis.\n\nMandiant also carefully evaluated the Accellion FTA software’s authentication logic to ensure it was not\nvulnerable to an authentication bypass issue, which might allow an attacker to access an authenticated endpoint\nwithout being validly authenticated. In addition to searching for injection-based issues, Mandiant searched for\nissues which could allow for users to bypass authentication or authorization controls. For example, Mandiant\nattempted to tamper with inputs containing session information such as cookies or tokens, to see if the requested\napplication endpoint or file could still be accessed. Mandiant did not identify any vulnerability through this\nanalysis.\n\n**Results of Testing FTA for Additional Vulnerabilities**\n\nThe Exploited Vulnerabilities were of critical severity because they allowed for remote code execution by an\nunauthenticated user. Mandiant’s source code analysis and penetration testing did not identify any new\nunauthenticated remote code-execution vulnerabilities beyond the Exploited Vulnerabilities.\n\nMandiant identified two new findings for authenticated users, consisting of Argument Injection (CVE-2021-27730),\nwhich was accessible only to authenticated users with administrative privileges, and a Stored Cross-Site Scripting\n(CVE-2021-27731), which was accessible only to regular authenticated users. The Argument Injection finding\nyielded a CVSS v3.0 score of 6.6 (medium severity) and the Stored Cross-Site Scripting finding was rated 8.1\n(high severity).\n\nAfter being alerted to Mandiant’s findings, Accellion developed FTA patch 9.12.444 to address these newly\nidentified findings. Mandiant validated that the patch effectively remediated these vulnerabilities, specifically\nattempting to exploit FTA version 9.12.444 and confirming that injected input was correctly sanitized.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Disclaimer: While every precaution has been taken in the preparation of this document, neither Accellion nor_\n_Mandiant assumes any responsibility for errors or omissions resulting from the use of the information herein._\n\n\n**FireEye, Inc.**\n\n601 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035\n408.321.6300/877.FIREEYE (347.3393)\ninfo@FireEye.com\n\n© 2021 FireEye, Inc.
