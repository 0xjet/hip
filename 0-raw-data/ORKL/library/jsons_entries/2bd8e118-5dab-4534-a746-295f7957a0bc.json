The threat actors behind the operation infect Android devices using\nseveral generations of malware, with the attackers including new features in each iteration.\nWe label them from v1-v4, with v4 being the most recent version deployed in 2017. From the\ntechnical point of view, the evolution of ZooPark has shown notable progress: from the very\nbasic first and second versions, the commercial spyware fork in its third version and then to\nthe complex spyware that is version 4. This last step is especially interesting, showing a big\nleap from straightforward code functionality to highly sophisticated malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nEvolution of ZooPark malware features\n\nWe have observed two main distribution vectors for ZooPark – Telegram channels and\nwatering holes. The second one was the preferred vector: we found several news websites\nthat have been hacked by the attackers to redirect visitors to a downloading site that serves\nmalicious APKs. Some of the themes observed in campaign include “Kurdistan referendum”,\n“TelegramGroups” and “Alnaharegypt news”, among others.\n\n\n-----\n\nTarget profile has evolved during the last years of campaign, focusing on victims in Egypt,\nJordan, Morocco, Lebanon and Iran.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more information on\na specific report, contact us at: intelreports@kaspersky.com.\n\n**Read the full “Who’s who in the Zoo.
