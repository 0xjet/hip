E.T.: We've updated the \"Rootkits From a Public_\n_Repository\" section and the appendix to include a second sample._\n\n[More than a year after Operation DRBControl, a campaign by a cyberespionage group that](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/operation-drbcontrol-uncovering-a-cyberespionage-campaign-targeting-gambling-companies-in-southeast-asia)\ntargets gambling and betting companies in Southeast Asia, we found evidence that the Iron\nTiger threat actor is still interested in the gambling industry.\n\nThis blog details how Iron Tiger threat actors have updated their toolkit with an updated\nSysUpdate malware variant that now uses five files in its infection routine instead of the\nusual three. We also provide details on Iron Tiger’s possible connections to other threat\n\n\n-----\n\nactors based on similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) we ve observed. Finally,\nwe describe some of the rootkits that Iron Tiger is using, one of which is used to hide files at\nthe kernel level, and has not been previously reported as being used by this threat actor.\n\n## A Look at the Iron Tiger Threat Group\n\nIn 2019, [Talent-Jump, Inc., a security service and system integration company,](http://www.talent-jump.com/) discovered\nseveral malware variants in a gambling company during an incident response operation and\nsought our help for further investigation and analysis.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, Talent-Jump found new samples for malware families that are attributed to\nthe Iron Tiger threat actor, which is also referred to as LuckyMouse, EmissaryPanda, and\nAPT27.\n\nWhile investigating Operation DRBControl in 2019, we found several connections to multiple\nthreat actors:\n\n[Iron Tiger, which uses the HyperBro trojan and some infrastructure links](https://thehackernews.com/2018/06/chinese-watering-hole-attack.html)\n[Winnti, which uses the same infrastructure and code-sharing links detailed in our paper](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0044/)\n[Bronze President, a threat actor that targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs).](https://www.securityweek.com/chinese-cyber-espionage-group-targeted-ngos-years)\nBack in 2019, we named a malware family, which we believed was new, as “Type 2.”\n\nHowever, after the publication of our report, we learned that the Type 2 malware family\ndescribed in our report was the same as the “RCSession” malware family that Dell\n[Secureworks described in a blog that they published in December 2019.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-president-targets-ngos)\n\nAfter finding multiple tools belonging to the Iron Tiger threat actor (which we now track as\nEarth Smilodon), it is likely that the new malware families that we found during the Operation\nDRBControl investigation came from the same threat actor.\n\nNew Version of SysUpdate Malware\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The old and new SysUpdate infection chains\nIn December 2020, we found a sample that we identified as one belonging to the SysUpdate\nmalware family, also named Soldier, [FOCUSFJORD, and HyperSSL. SysUpdate was first](https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2020/abstracts/emissary-pandas-middle-east/)\n[described by the NCC Group in 2018.](https://research.nccgroup.com/2018/05/18/emissary-panda-a-potential-new-malicious-tool/)\n\nIn the past, SysUpdate was loaded in memory by a known method involving three files:\n\nOne legitimate executable, sometimes signed, and vulnerable to dynamic-link library\n(DLL) sideloading\nOne malicious DLL loaded by the legitimate file\nOne binary file usually containing obfuscated code, unpacked in memory by the\nmalicious DLL\n\nAn additional executable that serves as a launcher is loaded in memory, which then loads\nthe final SysUpdate payload. Based on our investigation, instead of the usual three files, the\nthreat actor used five:\n\n_dlpumgr32.exe, a legitimate signed file that belongs to the DESlock+ product_\n\n\n-----\n\n_DLPPREM32.DLL, a malicious DLL sideloaded by dlpumgr32.exe that loads and_\ndecodes DLPPREM32.bin\n_DLPPREM32.bin, a shellcode that decompresses and loads a launcher in memory_\ndata.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher and contains two SysUpdate\nversions: one for a 32-bit architecture and another for a 64-bit architecture\nconfig.res, an encrypted file decoded by the launcher and contains the SysUpdate\nconfiguration, such as the command-and-control (C&C) address\n\n## Analysis of the Updated Tool: The Launcher\n\nIn summary, the launcher acts as an installer — it will copy the malware to a fixed place and\nensure that it runs during the next boot of the infected host. In detail, this process involves\nmultiple steps.\n\nThe launcher starts by instantiating the CLoadInfo object, which has the following structure:\n\n**Offset** **Description** **Hardcoded values in our sample**\n\n0 VTable of CLoadInfo class\n\n4 Directory to copy all files %PROGRAMDATA%\\Test\\\n\n8 Name of the legitimate executable _dlpumgr32.exe_\n\n12 Name of the sideloaded DLL _DLPPREM32.DLL_\n\n16 Name of the shellcode _DLPPREM32.bin_\n\n20 Name of the encrypted payload _data.res_\n\n24 MD5 of the encrypted payload e43e40416520dab5b4c44ac8af907078\n\n28 Name of the encrypted configuration _config.res_\n\n32 Name of the registry key value _servTest_\n\n36 Name of the service DisplayName _Servdisplay_\n\nTable 1. CLoadInfo object structure\n\n\n-----\n\nThe launcher s behavior changes depending on the number of arguments passed to the\nexecutable. It’s important to highlight that the change of behavior only depends on the\nnumber of arguments, and not the content:\n\n**No argument. If there is no argument, a hardcoded directory will be created wherein**\nall the files will be copied. The CreationTime, LastWriteTime, and LastAccessTime will\nbe updated according to the C:\\Windows\\system32\\kernel32.dll file and their file\nattributes will be set to “hidden” and “system”. Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI) will be used to run dlpumgr32.exe with arguments “-up -run -x” and it will exit\nthe current process.\n**One argument. It will skip the decoding of the configuration and persistence setup,**\nand will perform the same behavior as one with three arguments.\n**Three arguments.**\n\nThe launcher first decrypts the config.res file with a hardcoded Data Encryption\nStandard (DES) key. It encodes it using another key and writes it to the registry\nkey “Software\\Classes\\scConfig” (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or\n**HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive, depending on the privileges of the process).**\nAfter decrypting the configuration, the config.res file is deleted.\nDepending on the privileges of the process, the malware will add a value to the\n“Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” key, or it will create a\nservice that runs the malware at boot time\nThe launcher decrypts the data.res file with a different hardcoded DES key. The\nresult is a file with the following structure:\n\nSize of the 32-bit shellcode\n\n32-bit shellcode\n\nSize of the 64-bit shellcode\n\n64-bit shellcode\n\nTable 2. Structure of decrypted data.res file\n\nLastly, the launcher starts a suspended process with the command line\n“C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k LocalServices,”and injects the appropriate\nshellcode into it (either 32- or 64-bit). It will then resume the newly created process and\nexit the current process.\n\nThe following diagram summarizes the launch procedure:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The launch procedure of the updated tool\nThe payload itself is a new version of SysUpdate.\n\n## Analysis of the Payload\n\nThe features of the updated SysUpdate payload look similar to its previous versions. We\nobserved that the C++ code is structured around classes, many of which have selfexplanatory names. Some of these classes, such as CCompress, CIOStreamIF, or\n_CTcpSocket,have been present in the older versions of SysUpdate and compiled near the_\nend of 2015.\n\nOthers have been in existence for many years, such as TPacket, SCM Client, SystemInfo,\n_CMD5, CIOStream, and CInfo. Some of them are newer and have been developed in 2020,_\nsuch as ConfigReg, CWorkQueue, WindowsEvent, and CEncoder or cudp.\n\nThe sample we’ve analyzed contained many new and unique classes that featured a\nparticular naming convention. The names of classes are mostly self-explanatory, and the\nmanner in which the classes have been organized is probably the result of a framework\ndeveloped by our threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the classes names start with H (HControl, HSleep, and HTrans), I (IAgent,\n_ITcpAgent, and IAgentListener), “T” (TCommon, TFileInfo, TFileRename, TFileUpload,_\n_TServicesInfo, TListUser, and TTransmit), “C” (CSSLAgent, CSocks5, and CTcpAgent) or_\n“CM” (CMCapture, CMFile, CMPipeClient, CMPipeServer, CMProcess, CMServices, and\n_CMShell)._\n\nThe communication is made via a named pipe (in our case, it’s “\\\\.\\pipe\\testPipe”). Multiple\nfeatures that are expected of an espionage backdoor are present in the sample. These\ninclude a screenshot feature, file management functions (such as search, delete, move,\nupload, and download), process and services management, and command execution.\n\nIt should be noted that we also found recent samples of the SysUpdate backdoor that do not\nimplement these “new” classes. This suggests that different groups (or subgroups of Iron\nTiger) are also using this malware family in their attacks.\n\n## Pandora Backdoor\n\nOn two occasions (in March and October 2020), we found a kernel rootkit that had been\ndeployed. After analysis, it appears that this rootkit’s behavior is very similar to that of the\n[NDISProxy driver and remote access trojan (RAT). The version we found is slightly different](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-ndisproxy-driver/87914/)\n— the driver isn’t digitally signed but instead utilizes a known exploit to bypass Windows\nDriver Signature Enforcement (DSE) protection and load the driver directly into the system.\n\nWe chose to call it “Pandora” based on the program database (PDB) path of the unpacked\nstage 2, which is “F:\\Pandora\\x\\drv(32-64)\\bin\\src\\drvx64.pdb.”\n\nThe rootkit has multiple stages before getting to the actual payload:\n\n**Stage 1**\n\nGrants system privileges via Windows services\nUses DLL sideloading technique to evade security solutions\nStarts and injects code to a new svchost process to prevent tracking\n\n**Stage 2**\n\n[Utilizes a known vulnerability (CPU-Z CVE-2017-15303) that allows it to read and write](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15303)\ninto physical memory and read CPU control registers to turn the DSE off. This is done\nin conjunction with the Process Monitor driver (procxp152.sys), both of which are\ndropped upon loading the rootkit, even if they are not originally installed in the machine.\nLoads \"drvx64.sys,\" a crafted Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) driver\n\n**Stage 2 - Driver**\n\nRegisters WPF callback and filters incoming traffic with a predefined token\n\n\n-----\n\nInjects final payload into **lsass.exe**\n\n**Stage 3 - Final Payload**\n\nInstalls itself as a Windows service\nSets a specific keyword for communication\nExchanges messages and commands with the kernel driver\nPerforms backdoor functions\n\nEach backdoor has a different token that is encrypted in the registry. If the incoming traffic\ncontains a token and is in the HTTP format, the backdoor will intercept the traffic and process\nthe command. In the version that we’ve analyzed, the installer writes the token in the registry\nkey. We can’t trigger the backdoor without a current token, which makes the backdoor more\ndifficult to find and analyze.\n\n**Sample** **Token** **Mutex** **Semaphore**\n\n\nPandora\n20200310\n\nPandora\n20201010\n\n\nFHHqw@nF4Jo0vPAU180IP5h9umnd4KFi ENDnetfilter 234netfilter\n\nQp$zo&FgPBjGhm(.LGi_&j~tmhMO08) ENDdsfsfs xwwadsfsfs\n\n\nTable 3.

Pandora’s public code repositories\n\nRootkits From a Public Repository\n\nWe found two different rootkits that are being used for hiding processes, files, and services.\n\nBoth of them were taken from a public Github repository whose authors are not associated\nwith the threat actor.\n\nHidden.sys - https://github.com/JKornev/hidden/tree/master/\n\nThe first sample was found in April 2020. The driver was not signed and used the same DSE\nexploit that the Pandora backdoor uses for it to load.\n\nThe second sample was found in October 2020 and was signed by a legitimate certificate\nfrom Beijing Kingsoft Security Software Co., Ltd., a Chinese security software company. The\ncertificate has been valid since February 2020. We have communicated with Kingsoft\nCorporation Limited regarding this issue and they have confirmed that as of writing, the\ncertificate has already been voided.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3.\n\nHidden.sys properties and digital signature details\nThe tool is used to hide the threat actors’ tools and services. The tool’s configuration was\nadded to registry run keys on a victim’s computer.\n\n**Hidden Registry/Folder/File**\n\n**Type** **Value**\n\nREG HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\HiddenService\n\n\n-----\n\nREG HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\servTest\n\nREG HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\TrkWkss\n\nFolder C:\\programdata\\vlc\n\nFile C:\\programdata\\vlc\\vlc.exe\n\nFolder C:\\programdata\\test\n\nFile C:\\programdata\\test\\dlpumgr32.exe\n\nFile C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\Hidden.sys\n\nFile C:\\windows\\system32\\HiddenService.exe\n\nTable 5. The tool’s configuration\n\nThe references to “Hidden” are related to the rootkit itself. The “dlpumgr32.exe” and\n“servTest” lines are related to the new version of SysUpdate which we described earlier.\n\nWe do not know which malware variant is being sideloaded by vlc.exe. It is probably\ninstalled as a service named “TrkWkss.” We found a SysUpdate sample compiled in\nNovember 2020 that abuses a DLL sideloading vulnerability in VLC (see IOC list). This\nconfirms that this threat actor is abusing this legitimate program to sideload its backdoors.\n\nHyperBro Malware Family\n\nThe Iron Tiger APT group has used the HyperBro malware family since at least 2017. It is the\n[evolved version of HttpBrowser, which the group has been using since at least 2015.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0070/)\n\nWe found earlier versions of this malware that were sideloaded by malicious DLL files that\nunpacked and loaded a binary file named “thumb.db” in memory. All the requests were sent\nto the C&C server on port 443, with “/ajax” as the uniform resource identifier (URI).\n\nWhile investigating Operation DRBControl, we found an updated version of this malware\nfamily that implements some new classes. We provided a detailed analysis of this new\n[HyperBro version in our research.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-uncovering-DRBcontrol.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also discovered that the binary file that s being unpacked and loaded in memory by\nmalicious DLL files is named “thumb.dat.” We also saw that all requests sent to the C&C\nserver were sent to the URI “/api/v2/ajax” on port 443.\n\nSince we analyzed that single sample, we found several new samples that matched the\nnewer behavior, some of which have been deployed in our gambling target.\n\nHowever, we continue seeing samples that feature the “older” behaviors, which suggests that\ndifferent groups — or possibly subgroups of Iron Tiger — are using this malware family.\n[Some of these samples match the target and behavior listed by ESET in their blog.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\n\n### FRP Tool\n\nWe found the FRP tool being used on a Linux host, which is similar to Avast’s findings in a\n[report that they published on the Iron Tiger threat actor.](https://decoded.avast.io/luigicamastra/apt-group-targeting-governmental-agencies-in-east-asia/)\n\nThe FRP tool that we analyzed was a modified version, which was possibly copied off of\nGithub.\n\n### Type 1 Malware Family\n\nWe found three new samples of the Type 1 malware family that abuses Dropbox as a\nsecondary C&C channel, which we described in our Operation DRBControl whitepaper.\n\nApart from a modification in the malware sample’s configuration (which happened after we\npublished our paper), the differences with the versions that we analyzed in 2019 are minor.\nThe version numbering was at 11.0, while the last sample we analyzed in August 2019 was\nat version number 9.0. This shows that the development is still active.\n\nOn the infrastructure side, we observed that the threat actor switched from using IP\naddresses hosted on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to IP addresses hosted on Microsoft\nAzure.\n\nIt should be noted that after our blog publication in February 2020, the threat actor compiled\nnew Type 1 malware samples using a new configuration, which prevented us from closely\nmonitoring their operations. We believe that this was a direct reaction to our research,\nsuggesting that the threat actor read our investigation.\n\nIt’s also important to note that the compilation timestamp of the sideloaded DLLs were set a\nfew months in advance. For example, the binaries that we found in March and April 2020 had\nan August 26, 2020 compilation date. This is consistent with the behavior that we noticed\nduring Operation DRBControl, wherein some binaries that have been found in mid-2019 had\na compilation date of March 4, 2020. This shows that the threat actors intended to confuse\nforensics investigators with incorrect timestamps, which is why it’s critical to analyze\ntimestamps with caution during investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Infection Vector\n\nWe could not confirm the primary infection vector. However, traces of the exploitation of the\nMicrosoft Exchange vulnerability CVE-2020-0688 were found.\n\nMultiple infection vectors have been attributed to this threat actor in the past:\n\n[Watering](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/) [holes](https://www.secureworks.com/research/bronze-union)\n[Weaponized documents exploiting the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) method](https://www.secureworks.com/research/a-peek-into-bronze-unions-toolbox)\n[Weaponized documents exploiting the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Equation Editor](https://www.anomali.com/blog/multiple-chinese-threat-groups-exploiting-cve-2018-0798-equation-editor-vulnerability-since-late-2018)\n[Exploitation of the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability in Sharepoint](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0604)\n[Supply chain attack that compromises a chat software installer, Able Desktop](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\n[Exploitation of recent vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26855) [CVE-2021-26857,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26857) CVE-202126858, and [CVE-2021-27065) in](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27065) [Microsoft Exchange Server](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\n\nDuring our investigation, we found some old samples that fit in these categories but have not\nbeen reported. They are unrelated to this campaign and can be found in our IOC list.\n\n### Targets\n\nThe closer look into Iron Tiger was prompted because of an incident response investigation\ninvolving a Philippine-based gambling company that the group targeted. True to form, the\nIron Tiger threat actor has targeted the same company for 18 months.\n\nAside from targeting the same company, Iron Tiger also targeted other countries and\nindustries. Over the past 18 months, we observed how the group targeted governments,\nbanks, telecommunication providers, and even the energy sector in the Middle East and\nSoutheast Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. The countries that Iron Tiger has targeted in the past 18 months\n**Timeline**\n\nThe following timeline shows different samples found in the same gambling company that\nTalent-Jump and Trend Micro investigated:\n\nJuly 2019: Operation DRBControl starts\n[October 2019: One HyperBro malware sample found](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0398/)\nMarch 2020: New sample of Type 1 malware variant and a rootkit called Pandora found\nApril 2020: One rootkit sample for hiding files processes, files, and services found\nOctober 2020: New HyperBro and Pandora samples found\nDecember 2020: One sample of the SysUpdate malware variant found\nJanuary 2021: Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) Linux tool found\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis investigation provides more insight into the evolution of Iron Tiger’s toolkit and shows\nthe threat actor’s persistence after targeting the same company for 18 months, as well as\nexpanding its target base to include other companies and sectors in different countries in the\nMiddle East and Southeast Asia.\n\nWe detailed how Iron Tiger threat actors have updated their tools, adding new features, and\nslightly changing their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), notably by using a rootkit\nto hide its backdoors. The different campaigns with different versions of the same tools\nconcurrently being used suggest that there might be subgroups for this threat actor, or\nmultiple groups with access to the builders of these tools\n\n\n-----\n\nWe expect to see more cases involving four or five files instead of the usual trident in the\nfuture.\n\n[The indicators of compromise (IoCs) can be found in this appendix.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Appendix_Iron-Tiger-APT-Updates-Toolkit-With-Evolved-SysUpdate-Malware-Updated.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
