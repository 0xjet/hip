Latin American banking trojans share a lot of](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/17/numando-latam-banking-trojan/)\n[common characteristics and behavior – a topic ESET has dedicated a white paper to. Therefore, in the series,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/10/01/latam-financial-cybercrime-competitors-crime-sharing-ttps/)\nwe have focused on the unique features of each malware family to help distinguish one from the other.\n\n## Key takeaways\n\nLatin American banking trojans are an ongoing, evolving threat\nThey target mainly Brazil, Spain, and Mexico\nThere are at least eight different malware families still active at the time of this writing\n\n\n-----\n\nThree families went dormant during the course of this series so did not get their own blogpost, but we\nbriefly describe their main features here\nThe vast majority are distributed via spam, usually leading to a ZIP archive or an MSI installer\n\n## Current state\n\nBesides Amavaldo, which became dormant around November 2020, all the other families remain active to this\nday. Brazil is still the most targeted country, followed by Spain and Mexico (see Figure 1). Since 2020,\nGrandoreiro and Mekotio expanded to Europe – mainly Spain. What started as several minor campaigns, likely\nto test the new territory, evolved into something much grander. In fact, in August and September 2021,\nGrandoreiro launched its largest campaign so far and it targeted Spain (see Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 1. Top three countries most affected by Latin American banking trojans_\n\n_Figure 2. LATAM banking trojan activity in Spain_\n\nWhile Grandoreiro remains dominant in Spain, Ousaban and Casbaneiro dominated Brazil in the latest months,\nas illustrated by Figure 3. Mispadu seems to have shifted its focus almost exclusively to Mexico, occasionally\naccompanied by Casbaneiro and Grandoreiro, as seen in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. LATAM banking trojan activity in Brazil_\n\n_Figure 4. LATAM banking trojan activity in Mexico_\n\nLatin American banking trojans used to change rapidly. In the early days of our tracking, some of them were\nadding to or modifying their core features several times a month. Nowadays they still change very often, but the\ncore seems to remain mostly untouched. Due to the partially stabilized development, we believe the operators\nare now focusing on improving distribution.\n\nThe campaigns we see always come in waves and more than 90% of them are distributed through spam. One\ncampaign usually lasts for a week at most. In Q3 and Q4 2021, we have seen Grandoreiro, Ousaban and\nCasbaneiro increasing their reach enormously compared to their previous activity, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. LATAM banking trojan activity worldwide_\n\n## Impact\n\nLatin American banking trojans require a lot of conditions to attack successfully:\n\nPotential victims need to follow steps required to install the malware on their machines\nVictims need to visit a targeted website and log into their accounts\nOperators need to react to this situation and manually command the malware to display the fake pop-up\nwindow and take control of the victim’s machine\nVictims need to not suspect malicious activity and possibly even enter an authentication code in the case\nof 2FA\n\nThat said, it is hard to estimate the impact of these banking trojans just based on telemetry. However, in June\nthis year, we were able to get a picture when Spanish law enforcement arrested 16 people related to Mekotio\nand Grandoreiro.\n\nIn the [report, police state that almost €300,000 were stolen and they were able to block the transfer of a total of](http://www.interior.gob.es/prensa/noticias/-/asset_publisher/GHU8Ap6ztgsg/content/id/13552853)\n€3.5 million. Correlating this arrest with Figure 2, we see that Mekotio seems to have taken a much larger hit\nthan Grandoreiro, leading us to believe that the arrested people were more connected to Mekotio. Even though\nMekotio went very quiet for almost two months after the arrest, ESET continues to see new campaigns\ndistributing Mekotio at the time of writing.\n\n[For reference purposes, back in 2018, Brazilian police forces arrested a criminal behind another banking trojan](https://www.visaooeste.com.br/preso-no-tambore-por-desvio-de-r-400-milhoes-e-liberado-da-cadeia/)\nin what was called Operation Ostentation. They estimated that he had been able to steal approximately\nUS$400 million from victims in Brazil.\n\n## Families we didn’t cover\n\nDuring the course of our series, several Latin American banking trojans became inactive. While we had\nplanned to dedicate separate pieces to them, since they have been inactive for over a year now, we will just\nbriefly mention them in the sections below. We also provide IoCs for them at the end of this blogpost.\n\n### Krachulka\n\n\n-----\n\nThis malware family was active in Brazil until the middle of 2019. Its most noticeable characteristic was its\nusage of well-known cryptographic methods to encrypt strings, as opposed to the majority of Latin American\nbanking trojans that mainly use custom encryption schemes, some of which are shared across these families.\nWe have observed Krachulka variants using AES, RC2, RC4, 3DES and a slightly customized variant of\nSalsa20.\n\nKrachulka, despite being written in Delphi like most other Latin American banking trojans, was distributed by a\ndownloader written in the Go programming language – another unique characteristic among this kind of\nbanking malware (see Figure 6).\n\n_Figure 6. Krachulka downloader written in Go_\n\n### Lokorrito\n\nThis malware family was active mainly in Mexico until the beginning of 2020. We were able to identify additional\nbuilds, each dedicated to target a different country – Brazil, Chile and Colombia.\n\nThe most identifying feature of Lokorrito is its usage of a custom User-Agent string in network communication\n(see Figure 7). We have observed two values – LA CONCHA DE TU MADRE and 4RR0B4R 4 X0T4 D4 TU4\nM4E, both quite vulgar expressions in Spanish and Portuguese, respectively.\n\n_Figure 7 Lokorrito User Agent_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have identified several additional Lokorrito related modules. First, a backdoor, which basically functions like\na simplified version of the banking trojan without the support for fake overlay windows. We believe it was\ninstalled in some Lokorrito campaigns first and, only if the attacker saw fit, it was updated to the actual banking\ntrojan. Then, a spam tool, which generates spam emails distributing Lokorrito and sending them to further\npotential victims. The tool generated the emails based on both hardcoded data and data obtained from a C&C\nserver. Finally, we identified a simple infostealer designed to steal the victim’s Outlook address book and a\npassword stealer intended to harvest Outlook and FileZilla credentials.\n\n### Zumanek\n\nThis malware family was active exclusively in Brazil until the middle of 2020. It was the first Latin American\n[banking trojan malware family ESET identified. In fact, ESET analyzed one variant in 2018 here (in](https://www.welivesecurity.com/br/2018/01/17/zumanek-malware-tenta-roubar-credenciais-de-servicos/)\nPortuguese).\n\nZumanek is identified by its method for obfuscating strings. It creates a function for each character of the\nalphabet and then concatenates the result of calling the correct functions in sequence, as illustrated in Figure\n8.\n\n_Figure 8. Zumanek string obfuscation technique_\n\nInterestingly, Zumanek never utilized any complicated payload execution methods. Its downloaders simply\ndownloaded a ZIP archive containing only the banking trojan executable, usually named drive2. The\nexecutable was very often protected by either the VMProtect or Armadillo packer.\n\n[We think with low confidence that Ousaban may actually be the successor of Zumanek. Even though the two](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/05/05/ousaban-private-photo-collection-hidden-cabinet/)\nmalware families don’t seem to share any code similarities, their remote configuration format uses very similar\ndelimiters (see Figure 9). Additionally, we have observed several servers used by Ousaban that looked very\nmuch like those used by Zumanek in the past.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Similarities between Zumanek and Ousaban remote configuration formats_\n\n## The future\n\nSince Latin American banking trojans expanded to Europe, they have been getting more attention from both\nresearchers and police forces. In the latest months, we’ve seen some of their biggest campaigns to date.\n\n[ESET researchers also discovered Janeleiro, a Latin American banking trojan written in .NET. Additionally, we](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/04/06/janeleiro-time-traveler-new-old-banking-trojan-brazil/)\nmay see some of these banking trojans expanding to the Android platform. In fact, one such banking trojan,\n[Ghimob, has already been attributed to the threat actor behind Guildma. However, since we continue to see the](https://securelist.com/ghimob-tetrade-threat-mobile-devices/99228/)\ndevelopers actively improving their Delphi binaries, we believe they will not just abandon their current arsenal.\n\nEven though many Latin American banking trojans are somewhat cumbersome and overcomplicated in their\nimplementation, they represent a different approach to attacking victims’ bank accounts. Opposed to the most\nnotorious banking trojans of the recent past, they don’t inject the web browser, nor do they need to find ways to\nwebinject a certain banking website. Instead, they design a pop-up window – likely a much faster and easier\nprocess. The threat actors already have templates at their disposal that they easily modify for different financial\ninstitutions (see Figure 10). That is their main advantage.\n\n_Figure 10. Fake overlay window templates_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main disadvantage is that there is very little to no automation in the attack process without active\nparticipation of the attacker, the banking trojan will do almost no harm. Whether some new kind of malware will\ntry to automate this approach remains a question for the future.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn our series, we have presented the most active Latin American banking trojans of the past few years. We\nhave identified a dozen different malware families, most of which remain active at the time of this writing. We\nhave identified their unique features as well as their many commonalities.\n\nThe most significant discovery during the course of our series is likely the expansion of Mekotio and\nGrandoreiro to Europe. Besides Spain, we’ve observed occasional small campaigns targeting Italy, France and\nBelgium. We believe these banking trojans will continue to test new territories for future expansion.\n\nOur telemetry shows a surprisingly large increase in the reach of Ousaban, Grandoreiro and Casbaneiro in\nrecent months, leading us to conclude the threat actors behind these malware families are determined to\ncontinue their nefarious actions against users in targeted countries. ESET will continue to track these banking\ntrojans and keep users safe from these threats.\n\n_For any inquiries, contact us as threatintel@eset.com.
