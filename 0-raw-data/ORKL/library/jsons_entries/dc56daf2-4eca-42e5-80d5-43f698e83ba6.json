Our research team detected total of six samples\nof “CosmicDuke” malware related to this campaign and we chose one of them for further\nanalysis and provide this report as part of our findings.\n\nThe “CosmicDuke” malware is a combination of information stealer and backdoor and the\nmalware sample (August 2022) we have analyzed is a 32-bit executable binary part of\n“natural disaster” campaign that utilizes legitimate file names to deceive users.\n\nThe malware sample decompressed 1st stage load [malware] file in the memory, and that 1st\nstage loader file is created [self-copy of the files] in the system32 as a legitimate file. This is\nfollowed by the dropping of two files, with the dropped file sizes being 5kb and 4kb files in the\nsystem32, with the threat actor creating file names as legitimate names. After this,\n\n\n-----\n\nCosmicDuke malware loader creates a schedule task and installs windows service to\nachieve persistence and establishes the connection to C2 server for further operation from\nattackers. “CosmicDuke” malware achieves persistence on the victim system by creating a\nscheduled task and installing a windows service. Stealing clipboard contents and user files\nwith file extensions that match a predetermined list, keylogging activity, taking screenshots,\nand collecting user credentials, such as passwords, from a range of popular chat and email\nprograms, as well as web browsers to exfiltrate the captured data to an attacker controlled\nC2 server. “CosmicDuke” malware is spread through several tactics, including spearphishing, malicious advertising, exploit kits, and others. “CosmicDuke” malware is a\ncombination of the notorious MiniDuke APT trojan [backdoor] and another longstanding\nthreat, the information stealing Cosmu family.\n\n### The malware [“CosmicDuke”] has the following capabilities:\n\nMultiple Anti-debugging capabilities.\nAbility to enumerate drives.\nAbility to enumerate paths, files, and folders.\nCapability to load other libraries, processes, and DLLs in memory.\nCapability to handle command-line arguments and command execution.\nAbility to Gather System Information.\nNetwork communication capability.\nCollecting user credentials, such as passwords, from a range of popular chat and email\nprograms, as well as web browsers.\nTaking screenshots, Keylogging activity, Stealing clipboard contents.\n\n### Threat Actor attribution: APT29/COZY BEAR\n\nAPT29 is a cyber-espionage group which is belong to Russian espionage. This group has\nbeen operating since at least 2008. APT29 group is a component of the SVR, Russia’s\nforeign intelligence agency. the hack of the United States Democratic National Committee\n(DNC) in 2016 has been attributed to this group, as well as the SolarWinds supply chain\ncompromises in 2020. APT29 group are continuously evolving their tactic and tools and\nremain a threat with malware like Cosmic Duke.\n\n### Targeted Industries\n\nAcademic, Energy, Financial, Government, Healthcare, Media, Pharmaceutical, Technology,\nThink Tanks.\n\n### Targeted Countries\n\nGermany, Japan, United Kingdom, United States of America.\n\n### ETLM Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cyfirma Research Group noticed three campaigns recently attributed to APT29 or its\naffiliates named UNC040 (Jan 24, 2022 – Aug 23, 2022), Natural Disaster (Mar 17, 2022 –\nAug 23, 2022), Eliminate#30 (Oct 10, 2020 – Aug 23, 2022). Thus far, in 2022, as part of 3\nactive campaigns, APT29 has targeted the following countries – Japan, United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, and India. Herein, Japan and the United States\nhave proven to be the favourite targets. As part of the observed campaigns, malware such\nas BazarLoader, Cobalt Strike, MiniDuke, “CosmicDuke”, Sunburst, SUPERNOVA, and\nmore, were employed by APT29 attackers.\n\nOne of the campaigns ‘natural disaster’ which is potentially active since 17 March 2022 with\nthe motive of exfiltration of sensitive databases, and customer information for financial gains.\nThe threat actor is suspected to leverage attack methods such as exploiting the weakness in\nthe systems, phishing with malware, and trojan implants. Total of six samples were detected\nof ““CosmicDuke”” malware by our team related to this campaign as mentioned below and\nwe chose one of them for analysis:\n\n53264f1daff3df9a9e0974b71d9cd945\n182aeb380ed48d731217d904ee66e7ed\n9452d0b3e348890b3ca524efebcb15f6\nb771081daabc044141eecb8c9db69519\n6152e22093c052266d2c61ac2738bfc2\n3941639886899D6580DE2113D4C8841E\n\n### CosmicDuke Backdoor Analysis\n\n**Sample Details:**\n\n**MD5: 3941639886899D6580DE2113D4C8841E**\n\n**SHA256:**\nF6850A3C4C677C5F7E83C6B062B00C744C2E00A11346F7A4B00CA8677AC34C47 File\nType: Windows PE\n\n**Architecture: 32 Bit**\n\n**Subsystem: GUI**\n\n**First Seen: August-22**\n\nThis malware was written in Microsoft Visual C++ programming language.

This\nmalware binary file’s size is 294551 (bytes). As shown below, this file is having the version\ninformation as Microsoft Corporation [internal file name is svchost.exe], with this trick\nallowing the threat actor to hide their malicious intent.\n\nThis CosmicDuke backdoor loader initially verifies any security product running in the victim\nsystem before executing the CosmicDuke malware activity by calling\nCreateToolhelp32Snapshot, Process32Next, and Process32First. If any security product is\nrunning, this malware will be terminated with no expression of the malware behaviour.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter that this malicious code generates random characters [alphabet letters] and combines\nthose random characters together for making the file name [to showcase the filename as a\nlegitimate file name]. These created file names are used while creating malicious\npayload/files. Then this malware directly copies itself into the system32 by calling\nCreateFileW API.\n\nOnce the unpacked file is created in the system32, this malicious binary obtains the temp\nfolder location by calling GetTempPathW, then creates a 5kb file [File hash:\n0499C600266D8311722BBC31B89FB9AC] by calling again CreateFileW, after that this 5kb\nfile is copied into the system folder by calling CopyFileW.\n\nSimilar to the above behavior, this malware code creates a 4kb file in the temp folder [file\nhash: 943E98CB74058DFA942D9D6184E936B1] after that copies this file to system32 as\n.scr file extension.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the three files are created, the malicious loader launches the 5 kb files, in that pass the\nargument is ’ local system’ by calling CreateProcessW\n\nSimilar to this the malicious load launches the 4kb file by calling CreateProcessW without\npassing any argument. After that, this loader launches the self_copied file by calling the\nCreateProcessW API [passing argument is -enc[this argument is varying with every\nexecution]]. After this file is launched it creates the scheduled task by calling CreateFileW,\nthen modifies the Registry by calling the RegSetValueExW API.\n\nThe threat actor could collect data from the clipboard by calling the below code snippet.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, this malware collects the computer name, keyboard layout details, what drivers\nare available on the victim system, etc.\n\nThis malware establishes the connection to the FTP server and uploads the harvested\ndetails from the victim systems to the threat actor C2 server as well as waits for further\ncommands from the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dropped file_01**\n\n**Sample Details:**\n\n**MD5: 0499C600266D8311722BBC31B89FB9AC**\n\n**SHA256:**\n16F868FC0F84E1C91E11A8F715395E1122775E597031C0CAEDEAF4AF39122B68 File\nType: Windows PE\n\n**Architecture: 32 Bit**\n\n**Subsystem: Console**\n\nThis file is creating a service dubbed Java Virtual Machine Support Service [service name:\n\\javatmsup] with auto_start [this file is achieving persistence, so whenever the victim system\nis rebooted, this service will run automatically].\n\nAfter the service is started, this malware takes a snapshot of the running process by calling\nCreateToolhelp32Snapshot, then obtains explore.exe process handle by iterating this\nsnapshot and calling open process. After obtaining the explore.exe process handle, it\nduplicates this explore.exe process token and starts the malware process using the\nduplicated process token, followed by harvesting system information such as the password\nand other information.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dropped file_02**\n\n**Sample Details:**\n\n**MD5: 933B3C5D3728EF6E08AF4AE579C00D11**\n\n**SHA256:**\n47F3405AB0DA5AF125BCC6EBB6D17A1573B090C54D7A0A00630EC170CCC4B9D1 File\nType: Windows PE\n\n**Architecture: 32 Bit**\n\n**Subsystem: GUI**\n\nThis sample is a component of the CosmicDuke malware, which is obtaining the desktop\ndetails of victim systems by calling the RegQueryValueExW, RegOpenKeyExW, and then\nstoring those details in the buffer before launching this process by calling the\nCreateProcessW. This malware sends the harvested information to the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### List of IOCs: (Related to Campaign Name: Natural Disaster)\n\n**Sr**\n**No.** **Indicator** **Type** **Remarks**\n\n1 3941639886899D6580DE2113D4C8841E MD5 sample\n\n2 335D2EE728B4C1591B5B374A7CE4B758 MD5 1st stage\nCosmicDuke\n\n3 0499C600266D8311722BBC31B89FB9AC MD5 Dropped file by\nCosmicDuke\n\n4 6152e22093c052266d2c61ac2738bfc2 MD5 Other Sample\nRelated to\nCampaign\n\n5 182aeb380ed48d731217d904ee66e7ed MD5 Other Sample\nRelated to\nCampaign\n\n6 9452d0b3e348890b3ca524efebcb15f6 MD5 Other Sample\nRelated to\nCampaign\n\n\n-----\n\n7 53264f1daff3df9a9e0974b71d9cd945 MD5 Other Sample\nRelated to\nCampaign\n\n8 b771081daabc044141eecb8c9db69519 MD5 Other Sample\nRelated to\nCampaign\n\n9 933B3C5D3728EF6E08AF4AE579C00D11 MD5 Dropped file by\nCosmicDuke\n\n\n10 199[.]231[.]188[.]109 Ip\naddress\n\n11 46[.]246[.]120[.]178 Ip\naddress\n\n\nC2 connection\n\nC2 connection\n\n\n12 D:\\SV\nA\\NITRO\\BotGenStudio\\Interface\\Generations\\80051A8\n5\\bin\\bot.pdb\n\n\nstrings Pdb path\n\n\n13 \\\\.\\pipe\\40DC244D-F62E-093E-8A91-736FF2FA2AA2 strings Pipe name\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques (Based on our analysis):\n\n**Sr**\n**No.** **Tactic** **Technique**\n\n1 Execution(TA0002) T1059.003: Command and Scripting Interpreter:\nWindows Command Shell\n\n2 Persistence(TA0003) T1543.003: Create or Modify System Process: Windows\nService\nT1053.005: Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task\n\n\n3 Privilege\nEscalation(TA0004)\n\n4 Defense Evasion\n(TA0005)\n\n\nT1134.004: Access Token Manipulation: Parent PID\nSpoofing\n\nT1543.003: Create or Modify System Process: Windows\nService\nT1053.005: Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task\n\nT1027: Obfuscated Files or Information\n\n\n5 Discovery (TA0007) T1057: Process Discovery\n\nT1082: System Information Discovery\n\nT1012: Query Registry\n\nT1518.001: Software Discovery: Security Software\nDiscovery\n\n\n-----\n\n6 Collection (TA0009) T1115: Clipboard Data\n\nT1056.001: Input Capture: Keylogging\n\n\n7 Command and\nControl(TA0011)\n\n[Back to Listing](https://www.cyfirma.com/out-of-band/)\n\n\nT1071: Application Layer Protocol\n\n\n-----",
