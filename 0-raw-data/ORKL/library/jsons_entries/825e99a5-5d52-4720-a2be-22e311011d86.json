It’s the third\nwave of an attack we first reported in August 2019; the second wave, which we’re calling Charybdis (pronounced kuh-RIB-diss),\ncropped up in late 2020.\nThe attacks target a number of advertising SDKs within apps available via both Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store.\nApps associated with the Scylla operation have been downloaded 13+ million times.\nThis attack is ongoing; HUMAN and the Satori team continue to pursue the operation and its perpetrators.\n\n## Introduction\n\n“Modern defense” is the strategy behind protecting the internet and the advertising ecosystem from fraud through a combination of internet\nobservability, collective protection, and actionable intelligence with disruptions of fraud operations when they’re uncovered. This strategy is the\nbasis of how HUMAN works to safeguard the internet from digital attacks, disrupt the economics of cybercrime, and reduce the cost of\ncollective protection for customers.\n\nThree years ago, in August of 2019, HUMAN’s (then White Ops) [Satori team reported about a collection of 40+ Android apps openly](https://www.humansecurity.com/company/satori-threat-intelligence?hsLang=en-us)\ncommitting multiple types of advertising fraud. That investigation, which we named Poseidon after the malicious code within the apps, resulted\nin Google removing the apps from their Play Store.\n\nA disruption that results in dismantling the infrastructure powering a fraud scheme is rare. In the case of the original Poseidon operation, we\nweren’t in a position to disrupt the infrastructure in that way, but we were able to work with the Google Play Store team to remove the malicious\napps and ensure that the proliferation of that wave of the scheme stopped\n\n\n-----\n\nose do s bac aga, u su p s g y s adaptat o, c e e dubbed Scy a, s o cases e tact cs a d tec ques t ese t eat\nactors have deployed to try and cover their tracks better than in earlier adaptations.\n\nThey have also expanded their attack to more parts of the digital advertising ecosystem, further underscoring the importance of collective\nprotection to stop fraud at the source:\n\n[The Scylla operation featured 75+ Android apps and 10+ iOS apps committing several flavors of ad fraud. These apps generated 13+](https://www.humansecurity.com/topics/what-is-ad-fraud?hsLang=en-us)\n**million downloads in total before they were taken down.**\nSatori partnered with the security teams at Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store. HUMAN provided indicators of compromise\n(IOCs) and other evidence involving the malicious Scylla code. Google and Apple responded promptly to the threat, expanding the ring of\napps and removing them from their respective stores.\nHUMAN’s customers are protected from attacks on the digital advertising ecosystem through our media security solutions, including\nMediaGuard.\n\n## Poseidon, the father\n\nBefore we can dive into the specifics of how the Charybdis and Scylla operations worked, it’s helpful to have the context of how the original\nPoseidon phase of the scheme functioned and how the Satori team found it.\n\nThe 2019 Poseidon operation consisted of more than 40 Android apps openly committing ad fraud within their code. The apps in question\ndisplayed ads out of context or hidden from view of the device user, both of which are classic mechanisms within the broader ad fraud category\nof **[Misleading User Interface (PDF).](https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/2848641/Invalid%20Traffic%20Taxonomy%20(IVT)/IVT%20Taxonomy%20v2.0.pdf)**\n\nWhat made the Poseidon operation interesting was its use of “receivers” to trigger these ads to load. Receivers are, generally speaking, useful\nlittle bits of code that tell an app when something has changed with respect to the device. For example, a receiver monitors when a phone has\nbeen put into Airplane Mode, and then instructs the app to stop trying to connect to the internet until Airplane Mode is turned off again.\n\nHowever, well-intended and useful elements of code can be twisted to serve criminal goals. In the case of Poseidon, a receiver designed to\ndetermine if the phone was on and in use—a USER.PRESENT receiver—was key to instructing the host apps to call for ads to be shown outof-context or hidden from the user’s actual view.\n\nThe threat actors behind Poseidon didn’t cover their tracks very well, though, as all of the code they built into the apps to handle the fraud was\nout in the open. Once the Satori team reverse-engineered the code segments named for Greek mythological figures—hence, “Poseidon”—the\nfraud tactics were entirely laid bare. There was no real attempt to obscure the intention of the code. That would change in future iterations of\nthe scheme.\n\n## Poseidon, the father; Charybdis, the daughter\n\nFollowing the original Poseidon attack, which we worked closely with Google’s Play Store team to halt, the Satori team kept an eye on the\nthreat actors to see how they would respond.\n\nThis phase of fraud-fighting, the adaptation phase, is a crucial part of changing the economics of cybercrime. Every fraud scheme is a race\nagainst time for a threat actor: the fraudsters only have until their scheme is shut down to reap enough profit to recoup their cost of developing\n[and deploying it in the first place. The more that organizations can work together and share information, the more threat-hunters like Satori can](https://www.humansecurity.com/company/the-human-collective?hsLang=en-us)\ndiscover these fraud schemes and shrink the criminal’s profit window. Eventually, the cycle of operation discovery and dismantling becomes so\nshort that fraudsters won’t have enough time to recoup even their costs, so they’ll move on to another target.\n\nIn the later part of 2020 and early into 2021, the Satori team uncovered the second wave of this threat actor’s scheme. This iteration, which\nwe’ve dubbed Charybdis (named for Poseidon’s daughter), evolved from the Poseidon operation in two key areas:\n\n1. Code Obfuscation: The threat actors leveraged a popular developer tool named Allatori, which swaps out elements of code for single\n\nletters or numbers, making it very difficult for someone to look at the raw code of an app to understand what exactly it’s supposed to do.\nThere are many legitimate uses for tools like Allatori—much like there are legitimate ways to use many receivers—for example, the\ndeveloper of a popular app might want to slow down the development of knockoff apps that eat into download numbers and sales. But—\nmuch like the case with the use of receivers—the intent is what’s most important. In the case of Charybdis and Scylla, the fraudsters use\nAllatori to hide the code committing the fraud inside the host apps.\n2. SDK Targeting: The original Poseidon scheme did not target any specific advertising platform via the code buried inside the host apps.\n\nWith Charybdis, however, Satori researchers were able to reverse the obfuscated code and discovered targeting of specific well known\nadvertising platforms and systems.\n\n## Poseidon, the father; Charybdis, the daughter; Scylla, the granddaughter\n\n\n-----\n\nU s Sato tea as u co e ed a co ect o o **5** **apps o** **Goog e s** **ay Sto e a d** **0** **apps o** **pp e s** **pp Sto e t at co ta ed**\nobfuscated code similar to Charybdis. This third and latest phase of the operation is named for Scylla, Poseidon’s granddaughter and a sea\nmonster like Charybdis. These apps, when installed, commit several different flavors of advertising fraud:\n\n**App and Bundle ID Spoofing: this is when an app contains code that tells advertisers and ad tech companies that it’s a different app**\nentirely, with the intent of tricking those companies into placing ads there (if it’s pretending to be an especially popular app) or into\nspending more money to place ads (if it’s pretending to be something else entirely, like a streaming service).\n\nThe Scylla apps contained code that pretended to be other, legitimate games for advertising purposes, helping to keep their operation\nquiet.\n\n**Out of Context (OOC) and Hidden Ads: this is when ads are shown in a situation where ads should not be shown, or are rendered in a**\nway that a user cannot possibly see them. For example, if your phone randomly displays an ad on your home screen, that’s an out of\ncontext ad that a bad app is prompting. Alternatively, sometimes, apps will try and sneak extra ads in but not show them to a user. The\nads still count as having been “viewed” with the fraudulent code faking viewability metrics, which means the fraudster makes money, but\nno ad was actually visible.\n\nIn the case of Scylla, the Receiver code (described above) would trigger when the apps weren’t open. For example, triggering when a\ndevice was simply unlocked on the home screen.\n\n**Fake Clicks: Every advertiser knows that clicks are more valuable than impressions. And many advertising programs are set up to bill**\nthat difference accordingly. So, naturally, fraudsters are eager to develop ways to make it look like the ads being shown are also being\nclicked; they make more money as a result.\n\nCode within the Scylla apps is built to take information from real clicks—like the timing of a real person’s click of an ad and where on the\nad they clicked it—and then send that information again as a fake click to cash in.\n\nAlso new in the Scylla attack is the expansion from targeting advertising SDKs focused on Android apps into targeting iOS apps as well:\n\nWood Sculptor, an iOS app associated with Scylla\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nAbove, you can see a game called Wood Sculptor. The app is a knock-off of a popular game in which the user slices a path on a flat surface to\nallow a predetermined shape to pass through the resulting opening. Satori researchers who downloaded Wood Sculptor never saw any\n**ads displayed during the game’s operation.**\n\n\n-----\n\nPacket capture from Wood Sculptor\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nAbove, a packet capture of activity from Wood Sculptor. Note the numerous calls to ad servers. Below, execution traces show additional web\nviews where the ads called above are rendered invisible to the user.\n\nUI elements identifying the location of webviews for ads rendered through Wood Sculptor\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\n## How Scylla Worked\n\n### Spoofing\n\n[Many of the operations that our Satori team has uncovered use app or bundle ID spoofing as a primary fraud mechanism. Our PARETO](https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/the-shoe-is-a-lie-how-an-android-botnet-defrauded-advertisers-and-consumers?hsLang=en-us)\ninvestigation, for example, uncovered 29 Android apps that were pretending to be more than 6,000 CTV-based apps, which generally carry\nhigher prices for advertisers than the average mobile game.\n\nIn layman’s terms, the threat actors code their apps to pretend to be other apps for advertising purposes, often because the app they’re\npretending to be is worth more to an advertiser than the app would be by itself. They do this by inserting a different “bundle ID” or “app ID”\n(think driver’s license) in the code. Additionally, since some ad verification platforms can catch tactics like these by looking for frequently-faked\nbundle IDs, the threat actors will cycle through these IDs to avoid getting caught.\n\n[The apps in the Scylla operation are instructed which bundle ID to use by a remote command-and-control (C2) server, which tells the app](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/command-and-control-explained)\nwhich bundle ID to dynamically insert in the code for that specific impression opportunity, all in a matter of milliseconds.\n\n\n-----\n\nBundleId spoofing within Scylla\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nThe above screenshot is taken from a game called “Lady Run”. The bundle ID, however, names a different app entirely, a game called “War in\nPainting”.\n\nResponse from C2 server with spoofing instructions\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nHere is a decrypted snippet of the C2 server’s response. The app, in this case, is being told to mimic the app ID of a game called Balloon\nShooter.\n\n### OOC/Hidden Ads\n\nMany mobile apps show an ad as part of their loading screen - it’s a common enough mechanism that most of us wouldn’t think twice about\nseeing an ad when opening an app.\n\nWhat’s not common, however, is for the app to tell advertising platforms that it has displayed an ad to the user without having ever actually\ndone so.\n\n\n-----\n\nLoading a Scylla-associated app\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nThe above gif seems straightforward - a game is opened, there’s a brief loading screen, and then the game is ready to play. However, what the\nphone user does not see is that multiple virtual screens (aka “webviews”) are launched in a way hidden from the user. These webviews are\nloaded with ads, tricking advertisers into paying for fake impressions to an audience that is never there.\n\n\n-----\n\nWebView of traffic of the Scylla-associated app\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nAs you can see in the above log, several windows rendered…but not where the user could see them. Here is a sample of the actual ads which\nwere “loaded” to the off screen WebViews:\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\n### Fake Clicks Using Receiver Code\n\nEarlier in this post, we described the purpose of Receivers within apps: they’re helpful in determining when a device is being actively used (or\nnot) and when a device is well-suited for an ad to run (or not). Scylla’s designers abuse these device functions to find the ideal times to “serve”\nads when they won't actually be seen. To fully understand how they accomplished this, we have to start with the JobScheduler.\n\n\n-----\n\nView of JobScheduler within a Scylla-associated app\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nJobScheduler schedules a job for Android apps or devices, as the name might suggest. In the Scylla operation, JobScheduler tells the app to\nrun certain activities (like ads) when the correct conditions are met. To figure out if those conditions are met, the apps use Receivers.\n\nJobScheduler triggering on on/off/user_present within a Scylla-associated app\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nAbove, receivers determine if a device’s screen is on or off and whether the device is actively in use. These determinations feed into the apps’\nlogic about when and where to show ads.\n\nListeners triggering a call to the C2 server\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nMuch of what you see above is common to what the Satori team witnessed in the Poseidon operation. What’s new in Scylla is how the apps\nfake actual clicks of the ads in question. Fake clicks can have multiple benefits for the fraudster: for ad networks that bill on a views model,\nclicks demonstrate effectiveness, which makes advertisers want to stick around. But some other ad networks bill by the click, which\nincentivizes the fraudster to just fake the clicks to get paid.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nCode within Scylla-associated apps log click locations and save them to later fake clicks\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nAbove, the host apps track where real clicks happen on the device and store that information to later fake clicks.\n\n## But wait, there’s more.\n\n### Obfuscation\n\nAs noted above, one of the other key differences between the original Poseidon operation and the latest Scylla operation is how well the threat\nactors manage to cover their tracks. Many of the screenshots above may be difficult to parse for the average observer because bits of the\ncode have been “renamed” in an effort to make it harder for security researchers like our Satori team to reverse engineer.\n\nAbove, code from the original Poseidon attack stage with an unobfuscated command. Below, a Scylla app with the same command, now\n_obfuscated with Allatori._\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\nAdditionally, the bad actors behind Scylla used an unpaid, demo version of Allatori:\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of use of Allatori code obfuscation tool, deobfuscated for investigation purposes.\n\n**Source: Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team**\n\n## Navigating Charybdis and Scylla\n\nHUMAN’s Satori team has worked closely with the Google Play Store and Apple App Store to ensure that all of the apps we’ve identified as\nbeing a part of the Scylla operation have been removed from public access. We’ve also worked closely with advertising SDK developers to\nmitigate the impact of the operation to their processes and their advertising partners. Our researchers will continue to monitor the threat actors\nbehind the Poseidon, Charybdis, and Scylla operations for further adaptation.\n\nCustomers of [HUMAN’s MediaGuard solution are protected from fraud perpetrated by the Scylla operators.](https://www.humansecurity.com/products/mediaguard?hsLang=en-us)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nHUMAN and the Satori team recommend the following:\n\n**For the public:**\n\nIf you have any of the apps listed in the below Indicators of Compromise section on your devices, remove them. Even though HUMAN is\nmonitoring the threat actors, they may update the apps to change how they work, so removing the apps is your best bet.\nConsider reducing your risk of running dangerous apps by considering the source of the application and the trustworthiness of the brands\ninvolved. Secondary marketplaces, side-loaded or “cracked” applications may be much higher risk.\n\n**For HUMAN clients:**\n\n[MediaGuard helps protect you from the impacts of Scylla-related fraud.
