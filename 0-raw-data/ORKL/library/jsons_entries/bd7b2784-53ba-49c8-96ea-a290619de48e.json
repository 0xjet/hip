Talos has written on this variant and named it KevDroid.](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/04/fake-av-investigation-unearths-kevdroid.html)\n\nThis post provides our analysis of KevDroid., as well as details on the discovery of previously unknown trojanized\nversions of a Bitcoin Ticker Widget and a PyeongChang Winter Games application, that are downloaders for the\nspyware variants.\n\nBackground\n\nThe post by EST Security detailed an Android spyware disguising itself as an Anti-Virus app from Naver (the\nlargest search and web portal service provider in South Korea). While hunting for similar samples, I came across\ntwo more versions of the same variant. One of those called home to cgalim[.]com, a domain that Palo Alto\nNetworks had already observed being used by the Reaper group in non-mobile attacks (IOCs in Appendix).\n\nApp Name Icon SHA256\n\n\nGoogle Defender\nUpdate\n\n\n06222141a684de8a0b6e5dc1f7a2b14603c98dbe404ad7605dc9eb9d903c3df8\n\n\n-----\n\nUpdate f33aedfe5ebc918f5489e1f8a9fe19b160f112726e7ac2687e429695723bca6a\n\n_Table 1: Additional samples found for the original Android spyware variant linked to the Reaper group_\n\nPivoting on artefacts from the original variant led to the discovery of a more advanced variant of the same\nspyware, which is described in detail further below. In addition, I also stumbled upon two Android applications\nthat serve as downloaders for each of the two variants. They are discussed next.\n\nDownloaders\n\nWhile investigating the Reaper group’s Android spyware variants, I found two applications that have the ability to\ndownload and install an application from hxxp://cgalim.com/admin/hr/1[.]apk. I also observed the same URL\nserving the advanced variant of the Android spyware, confirming that these two applications served as\ndownloaders for the Reaper group’s Android spyware. The two applications are trojanized versions of popular\napplications available on the Google Play Store. The two trojanized versions were not posted on Google Play.\n\nWhile both downloaders contacted the same URL to download their payloads, looking further into their code I\nfound that they were each written to respectively download and drop one specific variant of Reaper’s Android\nspyware.\n\nApp Name Icon SHA256 DROPPED\nPAYLOAD\n\n\nPyeongChang\nWinter\nGames\n\nBitcoin Ticker\nWidget\n\n\n28c69801929f0472cef346880a295cdf4956023cd3d72a1b6e72238f5b033aca New\nvariant\n\n679d6ad1dd6d1078300e24cf5dbd17efea1141b0a619ff08b6cc8ff94cfbb27e Original\nvariant\n\n\n_Table 2: Android downloaders used to drop spyware variants linked to the Reaper group_\n\nBoth applications are signed with the same certificate thereby confirming their origins from the same author(s)\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nOwner: CN=Jhon Phalccon, OU=Google Chrome, O=Google Chrome, L=Washington, ST=US, C=US\nIssuer: CN=Jhon Phalccon, OU=Google Chrome, O=Google Chrome, L=Washington, ST=US, C=US\nSerial number: 7b320fab\nValid from: Wed Jan 24 10:22:50 GMT 2018 until: Sun Jun 11 10:22:50 GMT 2045\n\n\nOnce these downloaders are installed, they display a message prompting the user to update the application. If\nthe user follows the prompts, the downloader retrieves the payload and saves it to the external device memory as\n_AppName.apk. The payload is then loaded prompting the user again to confirm its installation before it is finally_\ninstalled on the device. The next section provides an analysis of the newer, more advanced variant of these\npayloads.\n\nAdvanced Variant Analysis\n\nThe following sample was used for this analysis\n\nApp Name Icon SHA256\n\nPU (Blank) 990d278761f87274a427b348f09475f5da4f924aa80023bf8d2320d981fb3209\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 3: New Android spyware variant discovered, linked to the Reaper group_\n\nThis sample has the following abilities:\n\nRecord video (default duration is 10 mins)\nRecord audio (default duration is 5 mins, saved as 48_d[TS].amr)\nCapture screenshots (saved as 96_d[TS].jpg)\nGrab the phone’s file listing (saved as 128_d[TS].txt)\nFetch specific files\nDownload a list of commands\nGet device info - 64-bit Android ID, Phone number, [System Properties etc (saved as 208_d[TS].json)](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/System.html#getProperties())\nRooting the device, using a binary called ‘poc’ in the package assets\n\nAdditionally, this advanced variant is capable of exfiltrating:\n\nVoice recordings from incoming and outgoing calls (saved as _p[Ph]_in_[D].amr or _p[Ph]_out_[D].amr)\nCall logs (saved as 16_d[TS].json)\nSMS history (saved as 32_d[TS].json)\nContact lists (saved as 144_d[TS].json)\nInformation on registered accounts on the phone (saved as 160_d[TS].json),\n\nIn each of these cases, [TS] is the current timestamp in the format yyyyMMddkkmmss, [Ph] is the source or\ndestination phone number for a call, and [D] is the call duration.\nWhile these exfiltration capabilities are shared in common with the original variant, this new variant writes its own\n[call recording library as opposed to using the open source library that was used by its predecessor.](https://github.com/aykuttasil/CallRecorder)\nAll exfiltrated information is written to the directory /sdcard/_pu on the phone and sent to\nhxxp://hakproperty.com/new/plat/pu[.]php?do=upload.\nBefore transmission, the files are AES-encrypted using the key “08D03B0B6BE7FBCD”. This encryption scheme\nand key is consistent across the two variants.\nPost-encryption the files are renamed with the addition of a suffix ‘x’. All created files are deleted after they are\nsent to the upload server.\nWhen commanded to fetch a list of commands, the list is fetched from\n\n1 hxxp://hakproperty.com/new/plat/pu[.]php?do=download_rc&aid=\" + [64-bit android_id]\n\nConclusion\nThe emergence of a new attack vector, followed by the appearance of new variants disguising themselves as\ncurrently relevant applications like the Winter Olympics, indicates expanding operations of the Reaper group that\nare actively in development.\nPalo Alto Networks customers benefit from the following protections against these attacks:\n\n[1. AutoFocus customers can track the group’s activity using the Reaper tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Reaper)\n2. WildFire detects all related samples with malicious verdicts.\n3. Traps blocks all malicious files associated with this group.\n\nIOCs\n\nReaper Downloader APK samples\n\n28c69801929f0472cef346880a295cdf4956023cd3d72a1b6e72238f5b033aca\n\n\n-----\n\n679d6ad1dd6d1078300e24cf5dbd17efea1141b0a619ff08b6cc8ff94cfbb27e\n\nAdvanced Variant sample\n\n990d278761f87274a427b348f09475f5da4f924aa80023bf8d2320d981fb3209\n\n**Non-APK Reaper-related samples making use of cgalim[.]com**\n\n0de087ffb95c88a65e83bd99631d73d0176220e8b740785de78d2d79294f2303\n\n6b1f2dfe805fa0e27139c5a4840042599262dbbf4511a118d3fba3d4ec35f2d7\n\n86887ce368d9a3e7fdf9aa62418cd68daeea62269d17afb059ab64201047e378\n\nd29895aa3f515ec9e345b05882ee02033f75745b15348030803f82372e83277a\n\nd5de09cc5d395919d2d2000f79326a6997f4ec079879b11b05c4d1a1a847ed00\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
