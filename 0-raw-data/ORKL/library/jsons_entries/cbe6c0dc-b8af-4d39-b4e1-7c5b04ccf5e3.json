But a growing body of evidence suggests the\nGandCrab team have instead quietly regrouped behind a more exclusive and advanced\nransomware program known variously as “REvil,” “Sodin,” and “Sodinokibi.”\n\n“We are getting a well-deserved retirement,” the GandCrab administrator(s) wrote in their\nfarewell message on May 31. “We are a living proof that you can do evil and get off scotfree.”\n\nHowever, it now appears the GandCrab team had already begun preparations to re-brand\nunder a far more private ransomware-as-a-service offering months before their official\n“retirement.”\n\nIn late April, researchers at Cisco Talos spotted a new ransomware strain dubbed\nSodinokibi that was used to deploy GandCrab, which encrypts files on infected systems\nunless and until the victim pays the demanded sum. A month later, GandCrab would\nannounce its closure.\n\n\n-----\n\nA payment page for a victim of REvil, a.k.a. Sodin and Sodinokibi.\n\nMeanwhile, in the first half of May an individual using the nickname “Unknown” began\nmaking deposits totaling more than USD $130,000 worth of virtual currencies on two top\ncybercrime forums. The down payments were meant to demonstrate the actor meant\nbusiness in his offer to hire just a handful of affiliates to drive a new, as-yet unnamed\nransomware-as-a-service offering.\n\n“We are not going to hire as many people as possible,” Unknown told forum members in\nannouncing the new RaaS program. “Five affiliates more can join the program and then we’ll\ngo under the radar. Each affiliate is guaranteed USD 10,000. Your cut is 60 percent at the\nbeginning and 70 percent after the first three payments are made. Five affiliates are\nguaranteed [USD] 50,000 in total. We have been working for several years, specifically five\nyears in this field. We are interested in professionals.”\n\n\n-----\n\nAsked by forum members to name the ransomware service, Unknown said it had been\nmentioned in media reports but that he wouldn’t be disclosing technical details of the\nprogram or its name for the time being.\n\nUnknown said it was forbidden to install the new ransomware strain on any computers in the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,\nKyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe prohibition against spreading malware in CIS countries has long been a staple of various\npay-per-install affiliate programs that are operated by crooks residing in those nations. The\nidea here is not to attract attention from local law enforcement responding to victim\ncomplaints (and/or perhaps to stay off the radar of tax authorities and extortionists in their\nhometowns).\n\nBut Kaspersky Lab discovered that Sodinokobi/REvil also includes one other nation on its\nlist of countries that affiliates should avoid infecting: Syria. Interestingly, latter versions of\nGandCrab took the same unusual step.\n\n[What’s the significance of the Syria connection? In October 2018, a Syrian man tweeted that](https://twitter.com/kvbNDtxL0kmIqRU/status/1052075557112942592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nhe had lost access to all pictures of his deceased children after his computer got infected\nwith GandCrab.\n\n“They want 600 dollars to give me back my children, that’s what they’ve done, they’ve taken\nmy boys away from me for a some filthy money,” the victim wrote. “How can I pay them 600\ndollars if I barely have enough money to put food on the table for me and my wife?”\n\n\n-----\n\nThat heartfelt appeal apparently struck a chord with the developer(s) of GandCrab, who soon\nafter released a decryption key that let all GandCrab victims in Syria unlock their files for\nfree.\n\nBut this rare display of mercy probably cost the GandCrab administrators and its affiliates a\npretty penny. That’s because a week after GandCrab released decryption keys for all victims\nin Syria, the [No More Ransom project released a free GandCrab decryption tool developed](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\nby Romanian police in collaboration with law enforcement offices from a number of countries\nand security firm Bitdefender.\n\nThe GandCrab operators later told affiliates that the release of the decryption keys for Syrian\nvictims allowed the entropy used by the random number generator for the ransomware’s\nmaster key to be calculated. Approximately 24 hours after NoMoreRansom released its free\ntool, the GandCrab team shipped an update that rendered it unable to decrypt files.\n\nThere are also similarities between the ways that both GandCrab and REvil generate URLs\n[that are used as part of the infection process, according a recent report from Dutch security](https://www.tesorion.nl/aconnection-between-the-sodinokibi-and-gandcrab-ransomware-families/)\nfirm Tesorion.\n\n“Even though the code bases differ significantly, the lists of strings that are used to generate\nthe URLs are very similar (although not identical), and there are some striking similarities in\nhow this specific part of the code works, e.g., in the somewhat far-fetched way that the\nrandom length of the filename is repeatedly recalculated,” Tesorion observed.\n\n\n-----\n\nMy guess is the GandCrab team has not retired, and has simply regrouped and re-branded\ndue to the significant amount of attention from security researchers and law enforcement\ninvestigators. It seems highly unlikely that such a successful group of cybercriminals would\njust walk away from such an insanely profitable enterprise.\n\n\n-----",
