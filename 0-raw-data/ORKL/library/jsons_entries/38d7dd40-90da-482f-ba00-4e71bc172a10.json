In Q1 of 2021, attack methods\n[including malware campaigns have contributed to a 564% increase in individuals affected by](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/identity-theft-resource-center-reports-564-percent-increase-in-individuals-impacted-by-data-compromises-in-q1-2021/)\na data leak, as well as a 12% increase in publicly-reported compromise.\nAs we continue to see leaks and widespread reports of ransomware attacks on organizations\nthat may result in data made public, PhishLabs is monitoring the reported volume of\npayloads identified in user inboxes. The below are the top malware families targeting\nenterprises during Q1.\n\nIn Q1, ZLoader comprised almost 65% of all reported payload activity, dominating the overall\nvolume of desktop malware. Although ZLoader started 2021 quietly, a one-day spike in\n[attacks during February represented one of the greatest upticks for a single payload that we](https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/surge-in-zloader-attacks-observed)\nhave observed in a 24-hour period in over a year.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince then, ZLoader has shown a strong presence, owning 79% of dropper activity in March.\nZLoader is a multi purpose malware-as-a-service (MaaS) that has maintained consistently\nhigh activity since 5/1/2020.\n\nTrickbot was reported in 12% of all payload attacks during Q1, with activity prompting a Joint\nCybersecurity Advisory from CISA and the FBI. This represents a 15% increase in attacks\nfrom Q4 2020.\nAlthough attacks grew, Trickbot numbers still barely overcame the volume of former leading\nmalware Emotet, before Emotet operations were dismantled. Emotet was the dominant\nMaaS for threat actors prior to January.\nDespite ZLoader operators deploying a significantly higher level of attacks during Q1, the\noverall volume of reported payload families decreased by 14% from Q4 2020. This is the\nlowest number of overall payload volume since Q2 2020.\n\nThis decrease could indicate that threat actors are increasingly using malware associated\nwith MaaS models to carry out attacks, rather than creating campaigns around a broader\nvariety of families not traditionally linked with these services.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Vishing Attacks Are at an All-Time High, Report Finds\n\nVishing attacks have increased almost 550 percent over the last twelve months, according\nto Agari and PhishLabs’ Quarterly Threat Trends & Intelligence Report.\n\n## Qbot Payloads Dominate Q1\n\n\n-----\n\nQbot payloads targeting enterprises contributed to almost three quarters of all email-based\nmalware since the beginning of 2022.\n\n## Social Media Attacks Double in 2021 According to Latest PhishLabs Report\n\nSocial Media attacks targeting organizations increased 103% in 2021, according to\nPhishLabs’ Threat Trends & Intelligence Report.\n\n\n-----",
