This attack vector is increasingly popular with\nmalicious actors as almost everyone on the planet carries at least one mobile device they\ninteract with throughout any given day. Thanks to a relative lack of security controls applied\nto mobile devices, these devices have become very attractive targets for a broad range of\nmalicious actors. For example:\n\n[WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/11/wirelurker-new-era-os-x-ios-malware/)\n[Six different Trojan, Adware and HackTool families launched “BackStab” attacks to](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/12/backstab-mobile-backup-data-under-attack-from-malware/)\nsteal backup archives of iOS and BlackBerry devices\nThe [HackingTeam’s RCS delivered its Spyware from infected PCs and Macs to](https://securelist.com/blog/mobile/63693/hackingteam-2-0-the-story-goes-mobile/)\njailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones\n\nRecently, we discovered another Windows Trojan we named “DualToy” which side loads\nmalicious or risky apps to both Android and iOS devices via a USB connection.\n\nWhen DualToy began to spread in January 2015, it was only capable of infecting Android\ndevices. However, within six months the malicious actors added the capability to infect iOS\ndevices. DualToy is still active and we have detected over 8,000 unique samples belonging\nto this Trojan family to date. It mainly targets Chinese users, but has also successfully\naffected people and organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain,\nand Ireland.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to found in traditional Windows PC malware such as process injection, modifying\nbrowser settings, displaying advertisements et al, DualToy also performs the following\nactivities on Android and iOS devices:\n\nDownloads and installs Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and iTunes drivers for Windows\nUses existing pairing/authorization records on infected PCs to interact with Android\nand/or iOS devices via USB cable\nDownloads Android apps and installs them on any connected Android devices in the\nbackground, where the apps are mostly Riskware or Adware\nCopies native code to a connected Android device and directly executes it, and\nactivates another custom to obtain root privilege and to download and install more\nAndroid apps in the background\nSteals connected iOS device’s information including IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, serial number\nand phone number\nDownloads an iOS app and installs it to connected iOS devices in the background; the\napp will ask for an Apple ID with password and send them to a server without user’s\n[knowledge (just like AceDeceiver)](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/03/acedeceiver-first-ios-trojan-exploiting-apple-drm-design-flaws-to-infect-any-ios-device/)\n\nSeveral years ago, Android and iOS began requiring user interaction to authorize a device to\npair to another device to prevent the kind of sideloading attack used by DualToy. However,\nDualToy assumes any physically connected mobile devices will belong to the same owner as\nthe infected PC to which they are connected, which means the pairing is likely already\nauthorized. DualToy tries to reuse existing pairing records to directly interact with mobile\ndevices in the background. Although this attack vector’s capability can be further limited by\nadditional mechanisms (e.g., ADB enabling, iOS sandbox) which make this threat not so\nsevere, DualToy reminds us again how attackers can use USB sideloading against mobile\ndevices and how malware can be spread between platforms.\n\n## Infecting Android Devices\n\nAlmost all samples of DualToy are capable of infecting Android devices connected with the\ncompromised Windows PC via USB cable. This functionality is usually implemented in a\nmodule named NewPhone.dll, DevApi.dll or app.dll.\n\nDualToy assumes ADB is enabled on the connected Android device. If ADB isn't enabled\n(which is the default option), the . However, some users, especially those who want to install\nAndroid apps from a PC or Mac, or who want to do advanced operations with their Android\ndevices, This is because ADB is both the only official interface for a Windows or Mac\ncomputer to operate an Android device via USB and it is a debugging interface.\n\n**Install ADB drivers**\n\nOnce loaded, the module will first download universal Windows ADB drivers from its C2\nserver (e.g., from http[:]//www.zaccl.com/tool/new_tool.zip) and install them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Windows ADB driver files downloaded from the C2 server_\n\nThen, some variants will directly drop a file named adb.exe which is the standard ADB\nWindows client. Other variants have compiled the ADB client’s source code into the module\nso that they could also perform ADB operations. Instead of adb.exe, the newest variant will\ndrop tadb.exe, a customized ADB client from Tencent’s Android management software.\n\nNote that since version 4.2 (released in early 2013), Android requires a user’s manual\nconfirmation to authorize a PC before building an ADB session. This was designed to\nprevent attacks such as sideloading apps via USB. However, if a user has authorized his PC\nin the past, the related key files will be stored in the %HOME%/.android directory on the PC.\nDualToy reuses these key files to bypass the intended security check.\n\n**Download and install apps**\n\nAfter the ADB environment is set up, DualToy will wait for an Android device to connect via\nUSB. Once connected, it will fetch a list of URLs from the C2 server, download the apps, and\ninstall them on Android device in the background via the “adb.exe install” command.\n\n_Figure 2 Android app downloading URLs on the C2 server_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Apps installed on the Android device by DualToy_\n\nFigure 3 shows the apps downloaded and installed by DualToy. They’re all games which use\nChinese as the default language, and none of them are available in the official Google Play\nstore.\n\n**Install and execute binary code**\n\nIn a recent variant, DualToy will download a PE executable named “appdata.exe” as well as\nan ELF executable file named “guardmb” from the C2 server. The appdata.exe file was\ncompiled from ADB’s source code with some customizations -- DualToy will execute it with\nthe command line “appdata.exe shell am start”. When invoked by this command line, the\nappdata.exe copies the guardmb file to connected Android device’s /data/local/tmp directory,\nand executes it.\n\n_Figure 4 appdata.exe executes guardmb on the Android device_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 guardmb starts a specific service on the Android device_\n\nThe guardmb file is an ELF executable for ARM architecture. Its functionality is simple –\nexecute Android’s system command “am” to start the service\n“com.home.micorsoft.service.BootWakeService”. Guardmb also specified the same service\nwas implemented in a third party app with package name of “com.home.micorsoft”.\n\nDuring the analysis, we weren't able to find the “com.home.micorsoft” app. However, we\ndiscovered another Android app with a similar package name “com.mgr.micorsoft”. Due to\nthe same typo (“micorsoft”) and same binary code fingerprints, we believe these two apps\nhave the same sources and likely have identical functionalities.\n\nThe app embedded a modified SU daemon program which was re-compiled from SuperSU\nproject’s source code. We named this specific Android Trojan “RootAngel”. After the service\nis started by guardmb, and install the SU daemon. It will also connect with its C2 server,\ndownload more Android apps and install them in background through “pm install” command.\n\n_Figure 6 RootAngel installs Android apps downloaded from the C2 server_\n\n## Infecting iOS Devices\n\nWe observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015\n(SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84).\nLater in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first\nvariant.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the\nmodule used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then\npacked with a standard UPX packer. There’s another file, insapp.ini, which contains\nconfigurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install.\n\n**Download and install iTunes**\n\nAfter being loaded, the insapp.dll will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected\ncomputer. If not, it will download two MSI format installers from its C2 server. For example,\nfor a 64-bit Windows PC, “AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi” and\n“AppleApplicationSupport64.msi” will be downloaded. These two installers are part of Apple’s\nofficial iTunes for Windows software that contains all necessary driver files that iTunes uses\nto interact with iOS devices.\n\nAfter that, DualToy will execute “msiexec.exe” to install the installers shown in Figure 8 in\nbackground via the “/qn” parameter.\n\n_Figure 7 The config file specifies URLs of the iTunes installer and iOS app(s)_\n\n_Figure 8 DualToy install iTunes installers via msiexec.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Operate iOS devices**\n\nIn order to operate iOS devices through installed iTunes drivers, DualToy reused an open\n[source project “iphonetunnel-usbmuxconnectbyport”. Using this, DualToy invokes APIs in](https://code.google.com/archive/p/iphonetunnel-usbmuxconnectbyport/)\niTunes’ iTunesMobileDevice.dll file via reflection, so that it can interact with iOS devices just\nlike iTunes does.\n\n_Figure 9 DualToy reflects symbols from iTunesMobileDevice.dll_\n\nDualToy will watch for USB connections. Once there’s a valid iOS device connected, it will try\nto connect to it using iTunes APIs. Like Android, Apple also introduced manual user\nauthorization starting with iOS 7 to prevent sideloading. As it does with Android devices,\nDualToy will check whether the iOS device was previously paired so that it can reuse existing\npairing record (Figure 10).\n\n_Figure 10 DualToy checks whether the device was paired by owner before_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Steal iOS device information**\n\nAfter successfully connecting with an iOS device, DualToy will collect device and system\ninformation, encrypt them and send to its C2 server. The collected information includes:\n\nDevice name, type, version and model number\nDevice UUID and serial number\nDevice baseband version, system build version, and firmware version\nDevice IMEI\nSIM card’s IMSI and ICCID\nPhone number\n\n_Figure 11  DualToy collects iOS device information_\n\n**Download and install app**\n\nIn addition to collecting device information, DualToy also tries to download IPA file(s) from the\nC2 server and install them on the connected iOS device. The URL it used to fetch the\ndownloading list is http://www.zaccl[.]com/tool/apple/wj_app.xml. During our analysis in April\nand in August 2016, this URL always returned a single file, “kuaiyong.ipa”. After downloading\nit, DualToy will copy the IPA file via the AFC service to the iOS device’s\n/var/mobile/Media/PublicStaging directory, and then install it via the installation_proxy\nservice.\n\n_Figure 12  DualToy fetch iOS app downloading URLs_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 Install iOS app via iTunes API_\n\nThe downloaded kuaiyong.ipa has an obfuscated bundle ID of\n“pWsbshWBn5XN9kk0twBUECAVt2E.dsE7UfuXZdinV60edM4u1Ul0d6hSf66akdZrmp”. It\nwas signed by an enterprise certificate issued to “Ningbo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.” The\ncertificate the app won’t be successfully installed on iOS devices anymore. However, the\nattacker could easily change the URL list replied by C2 server to push other apps.\n\n_Figure 14 The iOS app was signed by enterprise certificate_\n\n**AceDeceiver-like behavior**\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the kuaiyong.ipa has an expired certificate, we resigned it with a personal\ndevelopment certificate and then installed it on our testing device.\n\n[The app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like “ZergHelper”. It also has exactly the](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/pirated-ios-app-stores-client-successfully-evaded-apple-ios-code-review/)\n[same behavior as AceDeceiver. When launched for the first time, the app will ask the user to](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/03/acedeceiver-first-ios-trojan-exploiting-apple-drm-design-flaws-to-infect-any-ios-device/)\ninput his or her Apple ID and password (Figure 15). The nearby disclaimer says the\ncredentials won’t be uploaded to any server. However, through our reverse engineering and\ndebugging, we discovered the Apple ID and password will be encrypted by DES algorithm by\na fixed key of “HBSMY4yF” and 4 of “\\x12\\x34\\x56\\x78\\x90\\xab\\xcd\\xef”, and sent to the\nserver proxy.mysjzs[.]com after encoding the ciphertext with Base64. Figure 16 shows the\noutput by hooking the CCCrypt function with Frida. And Figure 17 shows the credentials\nbeing uploaded to the server.\n\nNote that, since the C2 traffic was HTTP instead of HTTPS, and the credential payload was\njust encrypted by DES with a fixed key, an attacker could sniff network traffic to capture the\npayload and steal the Apple ID and password in the payload.\n\n_Figure 15 Kuaiyong.ipa asks user to input Apple ID and password_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16 Apple ID username and password was encrypted with DES_\n\n_Figure 17 Encrypted Apple ID and password was sent to a server_\n\n## Mitigation\n\nPalo Alto Networks WildFire has successfully . URL Filtering has also blocked its C2 traffic\nso that it can’t download drivers, malicious payloads or apps. We have also created an\nAutoFocus tag to identify known DualToy samples.\n\nTo prevent similar attacks, we suggest users and organizations deploy both endpoint and\nnetwork-based malware prevention solutions. We also suggest users avoid connecting their\nmobile phones to untrusted devices via USB. The popularity and ubiquitous nature of mobile\ndevices ensures malicious attackers will only continue to refine and develop new mobile\nmalware, which means users and organizations will need to employ similar levels of\nprotection and user awareness historically provided to desktops, laptops, and networks.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n\n-----\n\nWe would like to thanks Zhi Xu and Josh Grunzweig from Palo Alto Networks for their\nassistance during the analysis.\n\n## Appendix\n\n**SHA-256 of selected samples**\n\nb028137e54b46092c5349e0d253144e2ca437eaa2e4d827b045182ca8974ed33 jkting.zip\n\nbbe5fcd2f748bb69c3a186c1515800c23a5822567c276af37585dab901bf550c new5.zip\n\n26ff76206d151ce66097df58ae93e78b035b3818c24910a08067896e92d382de\nNewPhone.dll\n\n24c79edc650247022878ddec74b13cf1dc59a6e26316b25054d015bdc2b7efc7 new_tool.zip\n\ncd432a8a0938902ea3016dae1e60c0a55016fd3c7741536cc9f57e0166d2b1b8 appdata.exe\n\n42290cefc312b5f1e4b09d1658232838b72d2dab5ece20ebf29f4d0d66a7879a guardmb\n\n7f7a3ed87c63bd46eb8b91a5bb36b399b4eebaf7d01342c13ef695340b9964a6\nMgr_700003.apk\n\n9f84665a891e8d9d3af76b44c1965eba605f84768841dfb748cb05ec119ffd9d phonedata.exe\n\nc8695fe9decbeedfe1f898464b6aa9da511045721c399486d00b889d888c8121 zWDLzv.dll\n\nf2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84\n\nc32c64196bb4e038657c3003586563407b5a36db74afb837a5b72f71cf1fadf1 DevApi.dll\n\ndee13984156d1b59395126fcac09f407ef7c7d7308643019ccee6e22683ea108 insapp.dll\n\neae9fda5ca026d2cc0fbdd6f6300d77867dae95a5c1ab45efdb4959684f188d2 insapp.ini\n\n899e3c72e2edf720e5d0f3b0dfbf1e2dcc616277c11cf592ab267a9fa0bfbac9 kuaiyong.ipa\n\nc8695fe9decbeedfe1f898464b6aa9da511045721c399486d00b889d888c8121\n\n**C2 Domains**\n\nwww.zaccl[.]com\n\npack.1e5[.]com\n\nrsys.topfreeweb[.]net\n\nabc.yuedea[.]com\n\nreport.boxlist[.]info\n\ntt.51wanyx[.]net\n\nhk.pk2012.info\n\ncenter.oldlist[.]info\n\nup.top258[.]cn\n\ndl.dswzd[.]com\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n\n-----\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
