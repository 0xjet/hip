This delivers Gandcrab 5.2\nransomware that currently does not have free decryption available yet.\n\nThey are using email addresses and subjects that will scare, shock, persuade or entice a\nrecipient to read the email and open the attachment.\n\nRemember many email clients or webmail services, especially on a mobile phone or tablet,\nonly show the Name in the From: and not the bit in <domain.com >. That is why these\nscams and phishes and malware deliveries work so well.\n\nTo confuse the issue even more the subject line was written in what looks like a mix of cyrillic\n& western characters & encoded in UTF8 format so a computer will automatically translate /\ndecode it. When I first tried to post this, I got a garbled mess of characters in the url to this\npost where the Copy & pasting from the email picked up the utf8 format\n```\nSubject: =?utf-8?B?Rmx1IHDQsG5k0LVtaWMgd9Cwcm5pbmcu?=\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## You can now submit suspicious sites, emails and files via our Submissions system\n\n**The CDC has not been hacked or had their email or other servers compromised. They are**\nnot sending the emails to you. They are just innocent victims in exactly the same way as\nevery recipient of these emails. These came from numerous different email addresses &\ndomains on the same server\n\nThe email looks like:\n\n**From: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <Peter@eatpraynope.com>**\n\n**Date: Tue 12/03/2019 22:52**\n\n**Subject: Flu pаndеmic wаrning.**\n\n**Attachment: Flu pandemic warning.doc**\n\n**Body content:**\n\n**You should take a look at this important announcement!**\n\nNow, flu virus activity is seriously elevated. US Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) states that within the a last half year, the situation has\nbecame dangerous noticeably: near 20,000 people were killed by the flu\nalready, and more than 220,000 were urgently hospitalized.\n\nInstructions DOC\n\nTo avoid contamination and keep people from the flu, CDC developed a\nprescriptions list.\n\n**You can find DOC file with this list attached to the letter.**\n\nIt is strongly recommended to study it with care and follow the directions to\navoid the disease.

They do not affect a\n**Mac, IPhone, IPad, Blackberry, Windows phone or Android phone. The malicious word**\nor excel file can open on any device with an office program installed, and potentially the\nmacro will run on Windows or Mac or any other device with Microsoft Office installed. BUT\nthe downloaded malware that the macro tries to download is windows specific, so will not\nharm, install or infect any other computer except a windows computer. You will not be\ninfected if you do not have macros enabled in Excel or Word. These Macros do not run in\n[“Office Online” Open Office, Libre Office, Word Perfect or any other office program that can](https://web.archive.org/web/20190331091056/https://products.office.com/en-gb/office-online/documents-spreadsheets-presentations-office-online)\nread Word or Excel files.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Please read our How to protect yourselves page for simple, sensible advice on how to avoid](https://web.archive.org/web/20190331091056/https:/myonlinesecurity.co.uk/how-to-protect-yourself-and-tighten-security/)\nbeing infected by this sort of socially engineered malware. Also please read our post about\nword macro malware and how to avoid being infected by them\n\n[Be very careful with email attachments. All of these emails use Social engineering tricks to](https://web.archive.org/web/20190331091056/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security))\npersuade you to open the attachments that come with the email. It might be a\nsimple message saying “look at this picture of me I took last night” that appears to come from\na friend. It might be a scare ware message that will make you open the attachment to see\nwhat you are accused of doing. Frequently it is more targeted at somebody ( small\ncompanies etc.) who regularly receive PDF attachments or Word .doc attachments or any\nother common file that you use every day, for example an invoice addressed to\nsales@victimcompany.com.\n\nThe basic rule is NEVER open any attachment to an email, unless you are expecting it. Now\nthat is very easy to say but quite hard to put into practice, because we all get emails with files\nattached to them. Our friends and family love to send us pictures of them doing silly things,\nor even cute pictures of the children or pets. Many of us routinely get Word, Excel or\nPowerPoint attachments in the course of work or from companies that we already have a\nrelationship with.\n\nNever just blindly click on the file in your email program. Always save the file to your\ndownloads folder, so you can check it first. A lot of malicious files that are attached to emails\nwill have a faked extension. That is the 3 letters at the end of the file name. Unfortunately\nwindows by default hides the file extensions so you need to Set your folder options to\n“show known file types. Then when you unzip the zip file that is supposed to contain the\npictures of “Sally’s dog catching a ball”, an invoice or receipt from some company for a\nproduct or service or receive a Word doc or Excel file report that work has supposedly sent\nyou to finish working on at the weekend, you can easily see if it is a picture or document &\nnot a malicious program. If you see JS **or** **.EXE or .COM or .PIF or .SCR or .HTA .vbs,**\n**.wsf, .jse .jar at the end of the file name DO NOT click on it or try to open it, it will infect**\nyou.\n\nWith these malformed infected word, excel and other office documents that normally contain\na vba macro virus, the vital thing is do not open any office document direct from your email\nclient or the web. Always save the document to a safe location on your computer, normally\nyour downloads folder or your documents folder and scan it with your antivirus. Many\nAntiviruses do not natively detect vba macro-viruses in real time protection and you need to\nenable document or office protection in the settings. Do not rely on your Anti-Virus to\nimmediately detect the malware or malicious content.  DO NOT enable editing mode or\n**enable macros**\n\nAll modern versions of word and other office programs, that is 2010, 2013, 2016 and\n365, should open all Microsoft office documents that is word docs, excel files and\nPowerPoint etc that are downloaded from the web or received in an email automatically in\n\n\n-----\n\n[protected view that stops any embedded malware or macros from being displayed and](https://web.archive.org/web/20190331091056/https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/What-is-Protected-View-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653)\nrunning. Make sure protected view is set in all office programs to protect you and your\ncompany from these sorts of attacks and do not over ride it to edit the document until you are\n100% sure that it is a safe document. If the protected mode bar appears when opening the\ndocument DO NOT enable editing mode **or enable macros the document will look blank or**\nhave a warning message, but will be safe.\n\nBe aware that there are a lot of dodgy word docs spreading that WILL infect you with no\naction from you if you are still using an out dated or vulnerable version of word. This is a\ngood reason to update your office programs to a recent version and stop using office 2003\nand 2007. Many of us have continued to use older versions of word and other office\nprograms, because they are convenient, have the functions and settings we are used to and\nhave never seen a need to update to the latest super-duper version. The risks in using older\nversion are now seriously starting to outweigh the convenience, benefits and cost of keeping\nan old version going.\n\n[I strongly urge you to update your office software to the latest version and stop putting](https://web.archive.org/web/20190331091056/http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&field-keywords=microsoft%20office&linkCode=ur2&tag=myonlinesecurity-21&url=search-alias=aps&linkId=W656QWL5QKIK44PF)\nyourself at risk, using old out of date software.\n\n**IOC:**\n\nMain object- “Flu pandemic warning.doc”\nsha256 a1ca75dfdcc8038650c27cbd4f7b3edc2cf5915cd75567c9bd2407ea0d099eba\nsha1 7971cd39eee59bf64cc2dfd7610d6f529eafd9df\nmd5 fae8e6b098eb9ecce2611f1dffc8f7b9\nDropped executable file\nsha256 C:\\windows\\temp\\191.exe\n73a994e9fa2804afceaf1286e4aba8522eb3c555b85766b03f03106118165736\nMD5 27fa5f1ef590ee5e503c3d15f210dab7\nSHA-1 6069666610d09085dc7926cde3d242427e67b167\nDNS requests\ndomain www.kakaocorp.link\nConnections\nip 107.173.49.208\nip 205.185.125.109\nHTTP/HTTPS requests\nurl http://205.185.125.109/samanta.exe\nurl http://www.kakaocorp.link/\nurl https://www.kakaocorp.link/static/tmp/eshe.png\n\nEmails from: ( probably loads of other domains & addresses on same server)\n\n\n-----\n\nviktoria@akk-actg.com\nflorian@jesseandjoannabelizewedding.com\nniko@sf-dns.net\npeter@eatpraynope.com\n194.58.39.79\n\n\n-----",
