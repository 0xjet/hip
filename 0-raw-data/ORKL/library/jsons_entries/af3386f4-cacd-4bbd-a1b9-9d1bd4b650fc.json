The group first emerged in 2018, and since](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/js.evilnum)\n[then, Evilnum’s activity has been varied, with recent reports using different components](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\n[written in Javascript and C# as well as tools bought from the Malware-as-a-Service provider](https://www.lastline.com/blog/malware-as-a-service-the-9-to-5-of-organized-cybercrime/)\n[Golden Chickens.](https://medium.com/@quoscient/golden-chickens-uncovering-a-malware-as-a-service-maas-provider-and-two-new-threat-actors-using-61cf0cb87648)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group s operations appear to be highly targeted, as opposed to a widespread phishing\n[operation, with a focus on the FinTech market by way of abusing the Know Your Customer](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/07/163938-fintech-firms-in-the-uk-europe-australia-canada-being-targeted-through-malware-by-evilnum-an-online-threat-group-report/)\nregulations (KYC), documents with information provided by clients when business is\nundertaken. Since its first discovery, the group’s mainly targeted different companies across\nthe UK and EU.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Nocturnus team has observed new activity by the group, including\nseveral notable changes from tactics observed previously. These variations include a change\nin the chain of infection and persistence, new infrastructure that is expanding over time, and\nthe use of a new Python-scripted Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Nocturnus dubbed PyVil\nRAT.\n\nPyVil RAT possesses different functionalities, and enables the attackers to exfiltrate data,\nperform keylogging and the taking of screenshots, and the deployment of more tools such as\n[LaZagne in order to steal credentials.](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)\n\nIn this write-up, we dive into the recent activity of the Evilnum group and explore its new\ninfection chain and tools.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**Evilnum: The Cybereason Nocturnus team is tracking the operations of the Evilnum**\ngroup, which has been active for the past two years, using a variety of tools.\n**Targeting the Financial Sector: The group is known to** [target FinTech companies, and](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/07/163938-fintech-firms-in-the-uk-europe-australia-canada-being-targeted-through-malware-by-evilnum-an-online-threat-group-report/)\n[is abusing the usage of the Know Your Customer( KYC) procedure in order to start the](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc/)\ninfection.\n**New Tricks: In this research, we see a deviation from the infection chain, persistence,**\ninfrastructure, and tools observed previously, including:\n\n**Modified versions of legitimate executables employed in an attempt to remain**\nundetected by security tools.\n**Infection chain shift from a JavaScript Trojan with backdoor capabilities to a**\nmulti-process delivery procedure of the payload.\n**A newly discovered Python-scripted RAT dubbed PyVil RAT that was compiled**\nwith py2exe, which has the capability to download new modules to expand\nfunctionality.\n\n## table of contents\n\n Overview of the Group\n\n[The Evilnum group has been reported to target financial technology companies, mostly](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/07/163938-fintech-firms-in-the-uk-europe-australia-canada-being-targeted-through-malware-by-evilnum-an-online-threat-group-report/)\nlocated in the UK and other EU countries. The main goal of the group is to spy on its infected\ntargets and steal information such as passwords, documents, browser cookies, email\ncredentials and more.\n\n\n-----\n\nAside from the group s own proprietary tools, Evilnum has been observed deploying Golden\n_[Chickens tools in some cases, as reported in the past.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/REXBtbnI2zXj4H3u6ofMMw)_ [Golden Chickens is a Malware-as-a-](https://medium.com/@quoscient/golden-chickens-uncovering-a-malware-as-a-service-maas-provider-and-two-new-threat-actors-using-61cf0cb87648)\nService (MaaS) provider that is known to have been used by groups such as FIN6 and\n[Cobalt Group. Among the tools used by the Evilnum group are More_eggs,](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0284/) [TerraPreter,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.terrapreter)\n[TerraStealer, and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.terra_stealer) [TerraTV.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.terra_tv)\n\nThe Evilnum group’s activity was [first identified in 2018, when they used the first version of](http://www.pwncode.io/2018/05/javascript-based-bot-using-github-c.html)\ntheir infamous JavaScript Trojan. The script extracts C2 addresses from sites like GitHub,\nDigitalPoint and Reddit by querying specific pages created for this purpose. This technique\nenables the attackers to change the C2 address of deployed agents easily while keeping the\ncommunications masked as requests are made to legitimate known sites.\n\n[Since then, the group has been mentioned several times, in different attacks, each time](https://blog.prevailion.com/2020/05/phantom-in-command-shell5.html)\nupgrading its toolset with new capabilities as well as adding new tools to the group’s arsenal.\n\nThe initial infection vector of Evilnum typically begins with spear phishing emails, with the\n[goal of delivering ZIP archives that contain LNK files masquerading as photos of different](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/REXBtbnI2zXj4H3u6ofMMw)\ndocuments such as driving licenses, credit cards, and utility bills. These documents are likely\nto be stolen and belong to real individuals.\n\nOnce an LNK file is opened, it deploys the JavaScript Trojan, which in turn replaces the LNK\nfile with a real image file, making this whole operation invisible to the user.\n\n[Up to this date, as described in this publication, six different iterations of the JavaScript trojan](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\nhave been observed in the wild, each with small changes that don’t alter the core\nfunctionality. The JavaScript agent has functionalities such as upload and download files,\nsteal cookies, collect antivirus information, execute commands and more.\n\n[In addition to the JavaScript component, as described in a previous research, the group has](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cardinal-rat-sins-again-targets-israeli-fin-tech-firms/)\nbeen observed deploying a C# Trojan, that possesses similar functionality to the former\nJavaScript component.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Previous infection chain_\n\n## New Infection Chain\n\n[In the past, Evilnum’s infection chain started with spear phishing emails, delivering zip](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\narchives that contain LNK files masquerading as images. These LNK files will drop a\nJavaScript Trojan with different backdoor capabilities as described above.\n\nIn recent weeks, we observed a change in this infection procedure: first, instead of delivering\nfour different LNK files in a zip archive that in turn will be replaced by a JPG file, only one file\nis archived. This LNK file masquerades as a PDF whose content includes several\ndocuments, such as utility bills, credit card photos, and Drivers license photos:\n\n_LNK file in ZIP_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the LNK file is executed, asin previous versions, a JavaScript file is written to disk and\nexecuted, replacing the LNK file with a PDF:\n\n_Example KYC documents from the PDF_\n\nUnlike previous versions that possessed an array of functionalities, this version of the\nJavaScript acts mainly as a dropper and lacks any C2 communication capabilities. This\nJavaScript is the first stage in this new infection chain, culminating with the delivery of the\npayload, a Python written RAT compiled with py2exe that Nocturnus researchers dubbed\nPyVil RAT:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Initial infection process tree_\n\n_In Cybereason, we are able to view the process tree and the extraction of the JavaScript_\n_from the LNK file:_\n\n_Initial infection process tree in Cybereason_\n\nThe JavaScript is extracted by outputting all lines that contain the string “END2” (commented\nout in the script) to a file named “0.js” in the temp folder and the LNK is copied to the temp\nfolder as “1.lnk”:\n\n_Extraction of the embedded JS script_\n\nThe JavaScript file is using a similar path to previous versions to drop binaries\n(\"%localappdata%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Credentials\\\\MediaPlayer\\\\”):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Snippet from JS file_\n\nAfter the script replaces the LNK file with the real PDF, the JS file is copied to\n“%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Credentials\\MediaPlayer\\VideoManager\\media.js” and is\nexecuted again.\n\nIn this second execution of the script, an executable file named “ddpp.exe” that is embedded\ninside the LNK file is extracted and saved to\n\"%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Credentials\\MediaPlayer\\ddpp.exe\".\n\nUnlike previous versions where the malware used the Run registry key for persistence, in\nthis new version, a scheduled task named “Dolby Selector Task” for ddpp.exe is created\ninstead:\n\n_ddpp.exe scheduled task_\n\nWith this scheduled task, the second stage of retrieving the payload begins:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Downloaders process tree_\n\nIn Cybereason, we see the attempted credential dump by the payload:\n\n_Downloaders process tree in Cybereason_\n\n## ddpp.exe: Tojanzed Program\n\nThe ddpp.exe executable appears to be a version of “Java(™) Web Start Launcher” modified\nto execute malicious code:\n\n\n-----\n\n_ddpp.exe icon_\n\nWhen comparing the malware executable with the original Oracle executable, we can see\nthe similar metadata between the files. The major difference at first sight, is that the original\nOracle executable is signed, while the malware is not:\n\n_ddpp.exe file properties_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Original javaws.exe file properties_\n\nAccording to Intezer engine there is huge amount of shared code between the malware\nexecutable and the legitimate Oracle Corporation file:\n\n_ddpp.exe code reuse in Intezer_\n\n## ddpp.exe Functionality\n\nThe ddpp.exe executable functions as a downloader for the next stages of the infection.\n\nIt is executed by the scheduled task with three arguments:\n\nThe encoded UUID of the infected machine\nAn encoded list of installed Anti-virus products\nThe number 0\n\n_ddpp.exe scheduled task arguments_\n\nWhen ddpp.exe is executed, it unpacks shellcode:\n\n\n-----\n\n_ddpp.exe passing execution to shellcode_\n\nThe shellocode connects to the C2 using a GET request, sending in the URI the three\nparameters received that were described above. In turn, the malware receives back another\nencrypted executable, which is saved to disk as “fplayer.exe” and is executed using a new\nscheduled task:\n\n_ddpp.exe C2 communication over HTTP_\n\n## fplayer.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nfplayer.exe functions as another downloader. The downloaded payload is then loaded by\nfplayer.exe to memory and serves as a fileless RAT. The file is saved in\n“%localappdata%\\microsoft\\media player\\player\\fplayer.exe” and is executed with a\nscheduled task named “Adobe Update Task”:\n\n_fplayer.exe scheduled task_\n\nFplayer.exe is executed with several arguments as well:\n\nThe encoded UUID of the infected machine\nThree arguments that will be used by the PyVil RAT at a later stage:\n\n“-m”: The name of the scheduled task\n“-f”: tells the PyVil RAT to parse the rest of the arguments\n\n“-t”: update the scheduled task\n\n_fplayer.exe scheduled task arguments_\n\nSimilarly to ddpp.exe, fplayer.exe appears to be a modified version of “Stereoscopic 3D\ndriver Installer”:\n\n_fplayer.exe icon_\n\nIn here as well, we can see the similar metadata between the files with the difference being\nthat the original Nvidia executable is signed, while the malware is not:\n\n\n-----\n\n_fplayer.exe file properties_\n\n_Original nvStinst.exe file properties_\n\nThis time as well, according to Intezer engine there are high percentage of code similarities\nwith Nvidia Corporation:\n\n\n-----\n\n_fplayer.exe code reuse in Intezer_\n\nWhen fplayer.exe is executed, it also unpacks shellcode:\n\n_fplayer.exe passing execution to shellcode_\n\nThe shellcode connects to the C2 using a GET request, this time sending in the URI the only\nthe encoded UUID. fplayer.exe was observed to receive another encrypted executable,\nwhich is saved as ‘%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Media Player\\Player\\devAHJE.tmp’:\n\n\n-----\n\n_fplayer.exe C2 communication_\n\nThe process decrypts the received executable, and maps it to memory, passing it the\nexecution.\n\n[The decrypted file is a compiled py2exe executable. py2exe is a Python extension which](https://www.py2exe.org/)\nconverts Python scripts into Microsoft Windows executables.\n\n## PyVil: A New Python RAT\n\nThe Python code inside the py2exe is obfuscated with extra layers, in order to prevent\ndecompilation of the payload using existing tools. Using a memory dump, we were able to\nextract the first layer of Python code. The first piece of code decodes and decompresses the\nsecond layer of Python code:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The first layer of deobfuscation code_\n\nThe second layer of Python code decodes and loads to memory the main RAT and the\nimported libraries:\n\n_Snippet from the second layer of code: extraction of Python libraries_\n\nThe PyVil RAT has several functionalities including:\n\nKeylogger\n\n\n-----\n\nRunning cmd commands\nTaking screenshots\nDownloading more Python scripts for additional functionality\nDropping and uploading executables\nOpening an SSH shell\nCollecting information such as:\n\nAnti-virus products installed\nUSB devices connected\n\nChrome version\n\nPyVil RAT’s Global variables give a clear understanding of the malware’s capabilities:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Global variables showing PyVil RAT's functionality_\n\nPyVil RAT has a configuration module that holds the malware’s version, C2 domains, and\nuser agents to use when communicating with the C2:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Configuration module_\n\nPyVil RAT’s C2 communications are done via POST HTTP requests and are RC4 encrypted\nusing a hardcoded key encoded with base64:\n\n_RC4 key_\n\n_data exfiltration from the infected machine being sent to the C2_\n\nThis encrypted data contains a Json of different data collected from the machine and\nconfiguration:\n\n\n-----\n\n_One of the decrypted JSONs sent to the C2_\n\n**Field** **Usage**\n\ntype Not clear\n\nxmode Not clear\n\nreq_type Request type\n\nsvc_ver Malware version in the configuration\n\next_ver A version of an executable the malware may download (-2 means the\nexecutables folder does not exist)\n\next_exists Checks for the existence of a particular executable\n\nsvc_name Appears to be a name used to identify the malware by the C2.\n\next_uuid Encoded machine UUID\n\nsvc_uuid machine UUID\n\nhost Hostname\n\nuname User name\n\nia Is user admin\n\nwv Windows version\n\ndt Current date and time\n\n\n-----\n\navs List of installed anti-virus products\n\ngc Dictionary of different configuration\n\nsc_secs_min Minimum sleep time between sending screenshots\n\nsc_secs_max Maximum sleep time between sending screenshots\n\nkl_secs_min Minimum sleep time between sending keylogging data\n\nkl_secs_max Maximum sleep time between sending keylogging data\n\nkl_run Is keylogger activated\n\nklr Is keylogger activated\n\ntc Is USB connected\n\ncr Is chrome.exe is running\n\nct Type of downloaded module to run: executable or Python module\n\ncn Module name corresponding to “ct”\n\nimp Execute the downloaded module (corresponds with “ct”)\n\npwds Extracted passwords\n\ncooks Cookies information\n\n_Fields used in C2 communication_\n\nDuring the analysis of PyVil RAT, on several occasions, the malware received from the C2 a\nnew Python module to execute. This Python module is a custom version of the LaZagne\nProject which the Evilnum group has used in the past. The script will try to dump passwords\nand collect cookie information to send to the C2:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decrypted LaZagne output sent to the C2_\n\n## Expanding Infrastructure\n\nIn previous campaigns of the group, Evilnum’s tools avoided using domains in\ncommunications with the C2, only using IP addresses. In recent weeks, we encountered an\ninteresting trend with Evilnum’s growing infrastructure.\n\nBy tracking Evilnum’s new infrastructure that the group has built in the past few weeks, a\ntrend of expansion can be seen. While the C2 IP address changes every few weeks, the list\nof domains associated with this IP address keeps growing. A few weeks ago, three domains\nassociated with the malware were resolved to the same IP address:\n\n**Domains** **Resolved IP**\n\ncrm-domain[.]net 5.206.227[.]81\n\ntelecomwl[.]com\n\nleads-management[.]net\n\nShortly thereafter, the C2 IP address of all three domains changed. In addition, three new\ndomains were registered with the same IP address and were used by the malware:\n\n**Domains** **Resolved IP**\n\ncrm-domain[.]net 185.236.230[.]25\n\ntelecomwl[.]com\n\nleads-management[.]net\n\nvoipssupport[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nvoipasst[.]com\n\nvoipreq12[.]com\n\nA few weeks later, this change occurred again. The resolution address of all domains\nchanged in the span of a few days, with the addition of three new domains:\n\n**Domains** **Resolved IP**\n\ncrm-domain[.]net 193.56.28[.]201\n\ntelecomwl[.]com\n\nleads-management[.]net\n\nvoipssupport[.]com\n\nvoipasst[.]com\n\nvoipreq12[.]com\n\ntelefx[.]net\n\nfxmt4x[.]com\n\nxlmfx[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n_Evilnum’s Infrastructure_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this write-up, we examined a new infection chain by the Evilnum group - threat actors who\nhave started to make a name for themselves. Since the first reports in 2018 through today,\nthe group’s TTPs have evolved with different tools while the group has continued to focus on\nFinTech targets.\n\nThe Evilnum group employed different types of tools along its career, including JavaScript\n[and C# Trojans, malware bought from the malware-as-a-service](https://www.lastline.com/blog/malware-as-a-service-the-9-to-5-of-organized-cybercrime/) [Golden Chickens, and other](https://medium.com/@quoscient/golden-chickens-uncovering-a-malware-as-a-service-maas-provider-and-two-new-threat-actors-using-61cf0cb87648)\nexisting Python tools. With all these different changes, the primary method of gaining initial\n[access to their FinTech targets stayed the same: using fake Know your customer (KYC)](https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc/)\ndocuments to trick employees of the finance industry to trigger the malware.\n\nIn recent weeks we observed a significant change in the infection procedure of the group,\nmoving away from the JavaScript backdoor capabilities, instead utilizing it as a first stage\ndropper for new tools down the line. During the infection stage, Evilnum utilized modified\nversions of legitimate executables in an attempt to stay stealthy and remain undetected by\nsecurity tools.\n\nThe group deployed a new type of Python RAT that Nocturnus researchers dubbed PyVil\nRAT which possesses abilities to gather information, take screenshots, keylog data, open an\nSSH shell and deploy new tools. These tools can be a Python module such as LaZagne or\nan executable, and thus adding more functionality for the attack as required. This innovation\nin tactics and tools is what allowed the group to stay under the radar, and we expect to see\nmore in the future as the Evilnum group’s arsenal continues to grow.\n\n## Mitre ATT&CK BREAKDOWN\n\n\n-----\n\n**Initial Access** **Execution** **Persistence** **Privilege**\n**Escalation**\n\n\n**Defense Evasion**\n\nDeobfuscate/Decode\nFiles or Information\n\n[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/)\n\n\nSpearphishing\nLink\n\n\n[User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) Scheduled\nTask\n\nWindows\nCommand Shell\n\n\nScheduled\nTask\n\n\n[JavaScript/JScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007/) Obfuscated Files or\nInformation\n\n\n**Credential Access** **Discovery** **Collection** **Command**\n**and Control**\n\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\n\nCredentials from\nPassword Stores\n\nCredentials from\nWeb Browsers\n\nOS Credential\nDumping\n\n\nProcess\nDiscovery\n\nSecurity Software\nDiscovery\n\nSystem\n[Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\nDiscovery\n\n\n[Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001/) [Data Encoding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/) Exfiltration Over\nC2 Channel\n\n\nScreen\nCapture\n\n\nIngress Tool\nTransfer\n\nApplication\nLayer Protocol\n\n\n[Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001/) Encrypted\nChannel\n\nSteal Web Session\nCookie\n\n## INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n[Click here to download this campaign's IOCs (PDF)](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/Evilnum%20IOCs.pdf)\n\n[Click here to read the threat alert for PyVil RAT.](https://www.cybereason.com/threat-alert-pyvil-rat)\n\n**Tom Fakterman**\n\n\n-----\n\nTom Fakterman, Cyber Security Analyst with the Cybereason Nocturnus Research Team,\nspecializes in protecting critical networks and incident response.
