Re:Dive\n\n**nao-sec.org/2021/01/royal-road-redive.html**\n\n2021-01-04\n\n\n-----\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe introduced the “Royal Road RTF Weaponizer” in our previous blog [1] (and presented at\nJapan Security Analyst Conference 2020 and CPX 360 CPRCon 2020). Royal Road is a tool\nshared by many targeted attack groups believed to belong to China. It’s been a year since\nour previous blog, and Royal Road is still in use. Here, we will introduce the Royal Roadrelated attacks observed during 2020.\n\n## Previous Blog\n\nLet’s briefly review the previous blog. Royal Road is a tool that generates RTF files that\nexploit the Microsoft Office Equation Editor vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882, CVE-20180798, CVE-2018-0802). The details of the tool are unknown, but the RTF file generated by it\nhas various characteristics. The definition of “RTF file generated by Royal Road” may vary\nfrom researcher to researcher. Therefore, we define a file that meets the following conditions\nas an “RTF file generated by Royal Road”.\n\n1. Exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Office Equation Editor\n2. Containing an object named “8.t”\n\nHowever, some RTF files are likely to be related to Royal Road, even though they don’t meet\nthe second condition. For classification purposes, we refer to this as “Related Samples”. In\nreality, this may also be an RTF file generated by Royal Road, but the truth is only known to\nthe attacker. Due to the our research, we have divided these into “Royal Road Samples” and\n“Related Samples”. However, they are treated the same in the specific case studies below.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd Royal Road is shared among various attack groups believed to belong to China.\nSpecifically, it is believed to be used by the following attack groups. The attack group alias is\nwritten for reference. Strictly speaking, these can be different. For example, TA428 and\nPirate Panda are not exactly equivalent.\n\n1. Temp.Tick (BRONZE BUTLER, RedBaldKnight)\n2. Temp.Conimes (Goblin Panda, Cycldek)\n3. Temp.Periscope (Leviathan, APT40)\n4. Temp.Trident (Dagger Panda, IceFog)\n5. Tonto (Karma Panda, CactusPete, LoneRanger)\n6. TA428 (Pirate Panda)\n7. Rancor\n\nAlso, we categorized the various characteristics of the RTF files used by these groups and\nshowed what they have in common.\n\n## Updates\n\nIt’s been a year since we introduced Royal Road. In the meantime, the RTF file, believed to\nhave been generated by Royal Road, has been used many times in targeted attacks, and\nseveral updates have been observed. First of all, we will introduce the updates.\n\nThe RTF file generated by Royal Road contains encoded malware. It is decoded by\nShellcode after exploit. In our previous blog, we introduced the following 5 encodings.\n\n1. 4D 5A 90 00 (not encoded)\n2. F2 A3 20 72\n\n\n-----\n\n3. B2 A6 6D FF\n4. B0 74 77 46\n5. B2 5A 6F 00\n\nMany of the RTF files we observed in 2020 used the 3rd and 4th encodings. However, a few\nsamples used the new encodings. The following 2 encodings.\n\n1. A9 A4 6E FE\n\nThis encoding can be decoded with code like the following:\n```\ndec_data = []\nfor i in range(len(enc_data)):\n  dec_data.append(((int.from_bytes(enc_data[i], \"little\") ^ 0x7b) + 0x7b) % 256)\n\n```\n1. 94 5F DA D8\n\n\n-----\n\nThis encoding can be decoded with code like the following:\n```\ndec_data = []\nxor_key = 1387678300\nfor i in range(len(enc_data)):\n  for _ in range(7):\n    x0 = (xor_key & 0x20000000) == 0x20000000\n    x1 = (xor_key & 8) == 8\n    x2 = xor_key & 1\n    x3 = 1 + (x0 ^ x1 ^ x2)\n    xor_key = (xor_key + xor_key) + x3\n  dec_data.append(int.from_bytes(enc_data[i], \"little\") ^ (xor_key % 256))\n\n```\nOur tool for decrypting Royal Road encoded object is already available on GitHub. It also\nsupports the above new encodings.\n\n[https://github.com/nao-sec/rr decoder](https://github.com/nao-sec/rr_decoder)\n\n\n-----\n\n## New Attack Groups\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, several attack groups use Royal Road. The following eight attack\ngroups have been observed to use Royal Road (including both Royal Road Samples and\nRelated Samples) during 2020.\n\n1. Temp.Conimes\n2. Tonto\n3. TA428\n4. Naikon\n5. Higaisa\n6. Vicious Panda\n7. FunnyDream\n8. TA410\n\nOf these, we have already reported on 1-3 attack groups in our previous blog.\nTemp.Conimes used NewCore RAT to attack Vietnamese organizations. Tonto used Bisonal\nto attack organizations in East Asia such as Russia.\n\nAnd the TA428 was also particularly active, using PoisonIvy, Cotx RAT, Tmanger, and\nnccTrojan to attack East Asian organizations such as Mongolia. We will not cover these\nindividual cases here, but if you are interested, see the IOC chapter. For TA428, the paper\n\n[2] and blogs [3][4][5] are available from NSJ (NTT Security Japan). Please refer to that.\n\nFor Naikon, CheckPoint Research reported [6], but unfortunately, we could not observe this.\nTherefore, in the following, we will introduce attack cases related to Royal Road for four\ngroups (5-8).\n\n### Higaisa\n\nHigaisa is an attack group that seems to have been active since at least around 2016. It is\nprimarily targeted at North Korean-related organizations and is believed to be aimed at\nstealing information using AttackBot, PIZ Stealer, and Gh0st RAT.\n\nThe blogs have been written by Tencent and Positive Technologies so far [7][8][9], and are\nattributed to (South) Korea. However, NSJ’s paper [10] showed a connection with Ghost\nDragon [11] and PKPLUG [12], and it was reported that it might belong to China.\n\nWe observed an attack by Higaisa on Royal Road in March 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe malware executed by the Royal Road RTF was AttackBot. AttackBot is a downloader\nthat has been used by Higaisa since at least April 2018.\n\n### Vicious Panda\n\nVicious Panda is an attack group reported by CheckPoint Research in March 2020 [13]. It is\nsaid to belong to China and targets East Asia such as Russia, Mongolia, and Ukraine.\n\nWe observed an attack on the Royal Road by Vicious Panda in March 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt has been reported to execute malware similar to Enfal and BYEBY.\n\n\n-----\n\n### FunnyDream\n\nFunnyDream is an attack group that is said to have been active since around 2018. It is said\nto belong to China and targets Southeast Asia such as Vietnam and Malaysia. FunnyDream\nuses Chinoxy and FunnyDream Backdoor. BitDefender has published a detailed report [14]\non FunnyDream.\n\nWe observed an attack by FunnyDream from March to May 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nChinoxy is a RAT that has been used by FunnyDream since around 2018. It decoded the\nconfig using two numeric data and communicates with the C&C server using its original\nprotocol using Blowfish.\n\n### TA410\n\nTA410 is an attack group that is said to have been active since around 2016. It is said to\nbelong to China and is suspected to be related to APT10. The report has been published by\nProofpoint [15][16][17] and is mainly targeted at public sector in the US. It uses malware\ncalled LockBack and FlowCloud.\n\nWe observed an attack by TA410 in October 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nFlowCloud is a RAT reported by Proofpoint in June 2020. FlowCloud has been reported to be\nv4 and v5, but the FlowCloud we observed at this time was similar to v4.\n\n## Attack case against Japan\n\nIn addition to the four attack groups shown so far (Higaisa, Vicious Panda, FunnyDream,\nTA410), attacks that appear to be related to Royal Road have been observed. Among them,\nwe will introduce an example of attacks on Japan. We are not able to identify which attack\ngroup made this attack. If you have any knowledge about it, please share it with us…\n\nThe attack on Japan took place in November 2020. The attack began with 2 RTF files\nattached to the email.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese RTF files did not contain an 8.t object, however did contain an associated object. This\nis the malware encoded by the 4th (B0 74 77 46) encoding shown above.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe overall picture of the attack is as follows.\n\nThe malware executed was an unknown RAT. We call this XLBug RAT because of the\ncharacteristics left in this RAT. The RAT held information such as C&C server encoded by\nBase64 and XOR.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following commands are implemented in XLBug RAT.\n\nGet directory information\nGet file information\nGet computer information\nExecute file\nUpload file\nDownload file\nRename file\nDelete file\nDelete itself\n\n\n-----\n\nThe naming convention and encoding of the encoded object contained in the RTF are similar\nto those of the TA428. However, we could not say that this was a TA428 attack.\n\n## Relationship\n\nIn the previous blog, we summarized the characteristics of attack groups that use Royal\nRoad. We used it to divide the attack groups into two groups. However, by 2020, those\ncharacteristics are almost meaningless. It has been standardized or deleted. It’s not as easy\nto group as it used to be. In the first place, the groups sharing Royal Road should be close.\nWe do not classify further, but if you have any comments please let us know.\n\n## Yara Rule\n\nThe GitHub repository we shared in the previous blog is still being updated.\n\n[https://github.com/nao-sec/yara_rules](https://github.com/nao-sec/yara_rules)\n\n## IOC\n\nThe IOC sheet shared in the previous blog is still being updated.\n\n[https://nao-sec.org/jsac2020_ioc.html](https://nao-sec.org/jsac2020_ioc.html)\n\n## Tool\n\nThe tool used by Royal Road to decrypt encoded object is still being updated.\n\n[https://github.com/nao-sec/rr_decoder](https://github.com/nao-sec/rr_decoder)\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nThe attacks using Royal Road have decreased compared to 2019, but are still ongoing.\nThere are many cases of attacks by TA428 and Tonto, but other attacks by different attack\ngroups (Higaisa, Vicious Panda, FunnyDream, TA410) have also been observed.\n\nThe attacks on Japan have also been observed and we were unable to identify this with a\nknown attack group. The use of Royal Road by these unknown attack groups is expected to\ncontinue.\n\nIn addition to Royal Road, there are other cases, such as the Tmanger family, that appear to\nshare tools among multiple targeted attack groups. We should continue to pay close\nattention to these tool sharing cases.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n\n-----\n\nnao_sec is an independent research team that does not belong to any company.\nIndividuals belong to each company and engage in research, but the activities of nao_sec\nstill maintain their independence from each company.
