It relies on** **[Homebrew, an open source software](https://brew.sh/)**\n\n**package manager to install Golang and Tor.** **Stay Updated**\n\n**The malware will then install fake certificates in the system to perform a MitM attack without notifying**\n\n**Email Subscription**\n\n**the user.**\n\n**Your email here**\n\n**[The structure of the fake App Store matches the application bundle structure and provides both English](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/BundleTypes/BundleTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i-CH101-SW1)**\n\n**and German interfaces. The main executable is Dokument.app/Contents/MacOS/AppStore.**\n\n**The archive in Mac OSX looks like this:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Fake document file_**\n\n**Mac OSX will run the application if it passes certificates. In this case, the malware is signed off by a**\n\n**“developer”, which may actually be a dummy account or that of a compromised user. In addition, the**\n**time stamp on the CA is new, which might mean that it was obtained specifically for this attack.**\n\n**The fake certificate imitates the COMODO root certificate. Take note that the fake certificate does not**\n\n**contain a COMODO Certificate Authority seal that certifies its validity, as seen in the comparison below:**\n\n**_Figure 6: Comparison of a Fake COMODO (left) root certificate vs a genuine COMODO certificate_**\n\n**_(right)_**\n\n**We noticed that this malware will not work for Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome since these two**\n**browsers have their own root certificates. Of all the major browsers, only Safari uses the system’s**\n\n**certificates.**\n\n**We observed the attacker targeting both Windows and Mac OSX in the same spam mail on June 9,**\n**2017. There is a file shortcut embedded in the malicious .docx file—one that will download an**\n\n**executable file from Dropbox—that executes once clicked by the user. The functionalities are similar to**\n**the malicious app provided, which includes installing tor and proxy.**\n\n**We have already notified Dropbox about the use of its service for this malware. Dropbox has already**\n**taken down the links.**\n\n**The malware will install two proxies running on local host port 5555 and 5588. All of the traffic will be**\n\n**hijacked into the first proxy (port 5555) with the victim’s external IP address as parameter.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7: Installing proxies on local host port 5555_**\n\n**The first (port 5555) proxy first finds the IP parameter. If it is not in Switzerland, the traffic will proceed**\n\n**as normal. If it detects an IP located in Switzerland, the malware will run an obfuscated JavaScript code**\n**and find its visiting domain. If the domain is in the target, the malware will perform a MitM attack and**\n\n**redirect the traffic to the second proxy (port 5588), which routes the traffic to the Tor network. The**\n**purpose of these steps is to target users in Switzerland and hijack their traffic**\n\n**After deobfuscating the malware, we found the target domains:**\n\n**_Figure 8: Hardcoded list of target banking websites in Switzerland_**\n\n**The target domain’s visitors will be redirected into an e-banking login page that looks and acts normally,**\n**but is located on dark web sites.**\n\n**However, once the victim enters an account and password. A window will pop out.**\n\n**_Figure 9: Hijacking connection to EKR bank_**\n\n**The pop-out window is just smoke and mirrors, where nothing actually happens once the countdown**\n**timer reaches zero.**\n\n**We analyzed the webpage and found attackers injecting a script into the webpage. Once the user**\n\n**enters an account and password, it will initiate POST using AJAX. The POST message is sent to the**\n**same site as the fake login page—which an attacker can control inside the Tor network.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10: Post message carrying argument_**\n\n**We decoded the data section and found not only the account and password, but that it also**\n**fingerprinted the user’s browser and system information.**\n\n**While Operation Emmental was able to bypass two-way authentication by tricking its victims into**\n\n**installing a fake app, we have not observed OSX_DOK.C doing this. However, since they can inject**\n**code into the webpage, it means they have the ability to do this as well.**\n\n**_Performing static analysis on OSX_DOK.C_**\n\n**We performed static analysis on the sample and found it packed by Ultimate Packer for Executables**\n**[(UPX), an open source executable packer that can often be abused by malware. We successfully](https://upx.github.io/)**\n\n**unpacked the initial sample we found dropped by the UPX unpacker.**\n\n**The malware is not obfuscated so we easily found interesting strings here. We can see that the**\n\n**malware relies on bash shell for most of its setup.**\n\n**_Figure 11: OSX_DOK.C strings_**\n\n**We were not able to unpack the sample discovered after June 9, 2017. The UPX gave a warning**\n**message about memory buffer overflow. The malware author seemingly made unpacking the malware**\n\n**more difficult to slow down or even evade the antivirus engine’s scanning process. The packer is the**\n**same but the malware tries to exploit the undiscovered bug in the UPX library that causes unpack**\n\n**failure. We have reported the issues to the UPX team, and they have already fixed it.**\n\n**[The impacted versions of the UPX library are 3.94, 3.93, and 3.92. This technique enables the malware](https://upx.github.io/upx-news.txt)**\n**to efficiently run while evading unpacking techniques from the AntiVirus-integrated UPX library.**\n\n**_Connecting OSX_DOK.C with WERDLOD_**\n\n**As mentioned earlier, we believe that OSX_DOK.C might be the MAC OSX version of WERDLOD, an**\n\n**online banking malware that used the same techniques as Operation Emmental. Other research have**\n**[also connected the OSX malware and Retefe (the external term used for WERDLOD) via similarities in](http://brycampbell.co.uk/new-blog/2017/4/30/retefe-and-osxdok-one-and-the-same)**\n**their behavior.**\n\n**While OSX_DOK.C is designed for MAC OSX, which is a Unix-like system, WERDLOD is designed for**\n**Windows. But in terms of features and behaviors, these two malware are very similar. Here is a list of**\n**their similarities.**\n\n**_Both malware kill all current browsers before installing fake certificates:_**\n\n**Both WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C are designed to kill the browser process before installing fake**\n\n**certificates. While WERDLOD kills processes for Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome, OSX_DOK.C**\n**does the same on Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.**\n\n**_Both malware share the same proxy settings and script:_**\n\n**While WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C use different codes (since they target different operating systems),**\n**they have similar proxy settings and script formats. In particular, WERDLOD uses scripts running on**\n\n**hxxp://127.0.0.1:555/#{random_string}.js?ip=#{my_ip} as proxy:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 12 : Local Area Network (LAN) settings_**\n\n**Comparing it to OSX_DOK.C, we can see that it uses the same script format:**\n\n**_Figure 13: OSX_DOK.C network settings_**\n\n**_Both malware have similar targets:_**\n\n**Both WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C targeted financial institutions, with a particular focus on banks in**\n\n**Switzerland. Further analysis of both malware revealed that their main targets are very similar, as seen**\n**in the screenshot below. While it’s possible that this is a coincidence, the rest of the evidence makes it**\n**unlikely for these two malware to target the same organizations by chance.**\n\n**_Figure 14: OSX_DOK.C target banks_**\n\n**Given the connection between WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C, it is reasonable to assume that the latter**\n**is also a part of the Operational Emmental campaign. To further illustrate, here is a timeline of**\n**Operation Emmental and its potential relationship to OSX_DOK.C:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 15: Connecting Operation Emmental with OSX_DOK.C_**\n\n**_Mitigation and Trend Micro Solutions_**\n\n**Despite phishing incidents for Mac devices being rarer than their Windows counterparts, users should**\n\n**still be aware that attackers can target them at any moment. By implementing best practices for**\n**phishing-type attacks—such as refraining from downloading files unless they are absolutely certain that**\n**they come from trustworthy sources—users can avoid being victimized by malware such as**\n**OSX_DOK.C that prey on users who lack awareness of phishing strategies.**\n\n**In addition, end users can also benefit from security solutions such as** **Trend Micro Home Security for**\n\n**Mac, which provides comprehensive security and multi-device protection against viruses, ransomware,**\n**malicious websites, and identity thieves.
