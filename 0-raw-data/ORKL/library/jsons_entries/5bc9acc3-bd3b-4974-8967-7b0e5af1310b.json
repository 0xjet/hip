The general consensus is that Regin\nis the work of a well-funded nation-state, though it’s impossible to point a finger at any\nparticular country and blame them with certainty.\n\nIt would appear as though a number of individuals and organizations had been keeping\ndossiers on Regin, because as soon as Symantec issued their first version of the report over\nthe weekend, other reports began streaming out, adding to the initial findings. More than one\ncompany and more than one researcher – including Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and\nAnalysis Team – have called this the most sophisticated attack campaign ever analyzed.\n\nHighly-complex malware has secretly spied on computers for years, say researchers\n[http://t.co/ip7hkaDBEg](http://t.co/ip7hkaDBEg) [pic.twitter.com/TnHhxZS0C4](http://t.co/TnHhxZS0C4)\n\n[— The Verge (@verge) November 23, 2014](https://twitter.com/verge/status/536627903623360512)\n\nAccording to [Kaspersky Lab’s findings, the Regin APT campaign targets telecom operators,](https://securelist.com/blog/research/67741/regin-nation-state-ownage-of-gsm-networks/)\ngovernment institutions, multi-national political bodies, financial and research institutions and\nindividuals involved in advanced mathematics and cryptography. The attackers seem to be\nprimarily interested in gathering intelligence and facilitating other types of attacks. While\nmuch of the intelligence gathered includes spying on emails and documents, the attack\ngroup also relentlessly targets telecommunication companies, which is normal, and at least\none GSM provider, which is not so normal.\n\nGSM stands for Global System for Mobile Communications. It’s a standard for cellular\ncommunications between mobile phones. The best way to think of GSM is as the second\ngeneration (2G) of mobile communication technologies—the predecessor of 3G and 4G\nnetworks. However, [according to reports, GSM is the default standard for mobile networks](http://www.4gamericas.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page&sectionid=242)\nused by the majority of telecoms. It’s available in more than 219 countries and territories and\nit demands a 90 percent share of the mobile telecom market.\n\nThey could have had access to information about which calls are processed by a particular\ncell, then redirected these calls to other cells, activated neighbor cells and performed other\noffensive activities.\n\n“The ability of this group to penetrate and monitor GSM networks is perhaps the most\nunusual and interesting aspect of these operations,” Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and\nAnalysis Team reported yesterday. “In today’s world, we have become too dependent on\nmobile phone networks which rely on ancient communication protocols with little or no\nsecurity available for the end user. Although all GSM networks have mechanisms embedded\nwhich allow entities such as law enforcement to track suspects, there are other parties which\ncan gain this ability and further abuse them in order to launch other types of attacks against\nmobile users.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers were able to steal credentials from an internal GSM Base Station Controller\nbelonging to a large telecom operator that gave them access to GSM cells in that particular\n[network, Kaspersky Lab said. My Threatpost colleague, Mike Mimoso, noted that Base](https://threatpost.com/regin-cyberespionage-platform-also-spies-on-gsm-networks/109539)\nStation Controllers manage calls as they move along a mobile network, allocating resources\nand mobile data transfers.\n\n“This means that they could have had access to information about which calls are processed\nby a particular cell, redirected these calls to other cells, activated neighbor cells and\nperformed other offensive activities,” Kaspersky Lab researchers wrote. “At the present time,\nthe attackers behind Regin are the only ones known to have been capable of preforming\nsuch operations.”\n\nIn other words, the Regin actors can not only passively monitor cellular communications\nmetadata, but they can also actively reroute cellular calls from one number to another.\n\n#Regin #APT targets the usual victims plus a famed cryptographer and the GSM\nstandard, according to @Kaspersky\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkas.pr%2F13EL&text=%23Regin+%23APT+targets+the+usual+victims+plus+a+famed+cryptographer+and+the+GSM+standard%2C+according+to+%40Kaspersky)\n\nAnother bizarre and curious aspect of the Regin attack group is the story of a famed Belgian\ncryptographer and mathematician named Jean-Jacques Quisquater. In February of this year,\nreports began emerging that Quisquater’s personal computer had been hacked six months\nearlier. While it isn’t unusual for prominent academics to be targeted in cyberattacks, the\ncase of Quisquater was slightly different because of some similarities between the attack that\ntargeted his machine and a separate attack that targeted the Belgian telecom, Belgacom.\n\n[The latter incident was the subject of an Edward Snowden revelation claiming that the NSA](https://threatpost.com/belgian-telco-belgacom-compromised/102299)\nand its British counterpart, GCHQ, had orchestrated the attack. Of course, many media\noutlets have alleged that these similarities do suggest that U.S. and British intelligence were\nbehind both attacks. While neither Kaspersky Daily nor Kaspersky Lab will cosign those\nallegations, it was reported by a number of news outlets at the time and is worth mentioning.\n\nIn addition to the story of Quisquater and the fact that it targets GSMs, the Regin attack\nplatform also boasts incredible technical sophistication, particularly in its pervasiveness. The\nattackers established backdoors with their command infrastructure to ensure inconspicuous\npersistence on the networks of their victims. All of the campaign’s communication traffic was\nencrypted to make sure attacks weren’t observed, both between the attackers and their\ncontrol servers and between the victim’s machines and the attack infrastructure.\n\n[Absolutely #1 coverage of #Regin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Regin?src=hash) [#malware espionage campaign, must read to get the](https://twitter.com/hashtag/malware?src=hash)\n[whole picture: http://t.co/M1pEhnxCRa by](http://t.co/M1pEhnxCRa) [@KimZetter](https://twitter.com/KimZetter)\n\n[— Eugene Kaspersky (@e_kaspersky) November 24, 2014](https://twitter.com/e_kaspersky/status/536995229501370368)\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of Regin s communications occur between infected machines – dubbed\n‘communication drones’ – on the victim’s network. The reason for this is twofold: it allows for\ndeep access while also limiting the amount of data exiting the network en route to a\ncommand and control server. When you see data leaving your network and traveling to an\nunknown network, that raises alarms. So this in-network, peer-to-peer communication makes\nit more difficult for network monitors to realize an attack is occurring.\n\nIn one unnamed Middle Eastern country, every single victimized network identified by\nKaspersky lab, communicates with all of the other networks in a sort of peer-to-peer\nstructure. The network included the president’s office, a research center, an educational\ninstitution’s network and a bank. One of the victims contains a translation drone that is able\nto forward the stolen data packets outside of the country, to the command and control server\nlocated in India.\n\n“This represents a rather interesting command-and-control mechanism, which is guaranteed\nto raise very few suspicions,” researchers wrote. “For instance, if all commands to the\npresident’s office are sent through the bank’s network, then all of the malicious traffic that is\nvisible to the president’s office’s sysadmins will only be with the bank, in the same country.”\n\nRegin is deployed in five stages, giving the attackers deep access to a victimized network as\neach stage loads subsequent parts of the attack. Modules in the first stage contain the only\nexecutable stored on the victim’s computer, and they’re all signed with phony Microsoft and\nBroadcom digital certificates in order to seem legitimate.\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky products detect modules from the Regin platform as: Trojan.Win32.Regin.gen and\n[Rootkit.Win32.Regin. Kaspersky Lab has also released a full-length technical paper if you](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/92/2019/02/19082823/Kaspersky_Lab_whitepaper_Regin_platform_eng.pdf)\nwould like to dig a bit deeper.\n\n[APT](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/apt/)\n[GReAT](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/great/)\n[Kaspersky Lab](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/kaspersky-lab/)\n[malware](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/malware-2/)\n[Regin](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/regin/)\n[research](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/research/)\n\nShare article\n\nRelated\n\n\n-----",
