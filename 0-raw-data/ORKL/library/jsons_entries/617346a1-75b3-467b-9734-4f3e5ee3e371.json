Organizations that detect potential compromise should apply the steps\nin the Incident Response section of this CSA.\nUpdate November 10, 2022:\nThis CSA has been updated with additional IOCs. For a downloadable copy of the IOCs, see the\nfollowing Malware Analysis Reports (MARs):\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nMAR-10400779-1\nMAR-10400779-2\nMAR-10401765-1\nMAR-10398871-1\nNew, November 10, 2022: MAR-10410305-1.v1 JSP Webshell\n\nUpdate End\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nCVE-2022-27924\nCVE-2022-27924 is a high-severity vulnerability enabling an unauthenticated malicious actor to inject\narbitrary memcache commands into a targeted ZCS instance and cause an overwrite of arbitrary\ncached entries. The actor can then steal ZCS email account credentials in cleartext form without any\nuser interaction. With valid email account credentials in an organization not enforcing multifactor\nauthentication (MFA), a malicious actor can use spear phishing, social engineering, and business\nemail compromise (BEC) attacks against the compromised organization. Additionally, malicious\nactors could use the valid account credentials to open webshells and maintain persistent access.\nOn March 11, 2022, researchers from SonarSource announced the discovery of this ZCS\nvulnerability. Zimbra issued fixes for releases 8.8.15 and 9.0 on May 10, 2022. Based on evidence of\nactive exploitation, CISA added this vulnerability to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on\nAugust 4, 2022. Due to ease of exploitation, CISA and the MS-ISAC expect to see widespread\nexploitation of unpatched ZCS instances in government and private networks.\n\nCVE-2022-27925 and CVE-2022-37042\nCVE-2022-27925 is a high-severity vulnerability in ZCS releases 8.8.15 and 9.0 that have\nmboximport functionality to receive a ZIP archive and extract files from it. An authenticated user has\nthe ability to upload arbitrary files to the system thereby leading to directory traversal.[1] On August\n10, 2022, researchers from Volexity reported widespread exploitation—against over 1,000 ZCS\ninstances—of CVE-2022-27925 in conjunction with CVE-2022-37042.[2] CISA added both CVEs to\nthe Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on August 11, 2022.\nCVE-2022-37042 is an authentication bypass vulnerability that affects ZCS releases 8.8.15 and 9.0.\nCVE-2022-37042 could allow an unauthenticated malicious actor access to a vulnerable ZCS\n\nPage 2 of 6 | Product ID: AA22-228A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nCISA | MS-ISAC\n\nTLP:WHITE\ninstance. According to Zimbra, CVE-2022-37042 is found in the MailboxImportServlet\nfunction.[3][4] Zimbra issued fixes in late July 2022.\n\nCVE-2022-30333\nCVE-2022-30333 is a high-severity directory traversal vulnerability in RARLAB UnRAR on Linux and\nUNIX allowing a malicious actor to write to files during an extract (unpack) operation. A malicious\nactor can exploit CVE-2022-30333 against a ZCS server by sending an email with a malicious RAR\nfile. Upon email receipt, the ZCS server would automatically extract the RAR file to check for spam or\nmalware.[5] Any ZCS instance with unrar installed is vulnerable to CVE-2022-30333.\nResearchers from SonarSource shared details about this vulnerability in June 2022.[6] Zimbra made\nconfiguration changes to use the 7zip program instead of unrar.[7] CISA added CVE-2022-3033 to\nthe Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on August 9, 2022. Based on industry reporting, a\nmalicious cyber actor is selling a cross-site scripting (XSS) exploit kit for the ZCS vulnerability to\nCVE-2022-30333. A Metasploit module is also available that creates a RAR file that can be emailed\nto a ZCS server to exploit CVE-2022-30333.[8]\n\nCVE-2022-24682\nCVE-2022-24682 is a medium-severity vulnerability that impacts ZCS webmail clients running\nreleases before 8.8.15 patch 30 (update 1), which contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability\nallowing malicious actors to steal session cookie files. Researchers from Volexity shared this\nvulnerability on February 3, 2022[9], and Zimbra issued a fix on February 4, 2022.[10] CISA added\nthis vulnerability to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on February 25, 2022.\n\nDETECTION METHODS\nNote: CISA and the MS-ISAC will update this section with additional IOCs and signatures as further\ninformation becomes available.\nCISA recommends administrators, especially at organizations that did not immediately update their\nZCS instances upon patch release, to hunt for malicious activity using the following third-party\ndetection signatures:\n•\n\nUpdate September 27, 2022: Hunt for IOCs including:\n\nPage 3 of 6 | Product ID: AA22-228A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nCISA | MS-ISAC\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\n•\n\nIP Addresses\n\nNote\n\n62.113.255[.]70\n\nNew Sept ember 27, 2022: Used by cyber actors during\nAugust 25-26, 2022 while attempting to exploit CVE-202227925 and CVE-2022-37042\n\n185.112.83[.]77\n\nNew Sept ember 27, 2022: Used by cyber actors during\nAugust 25-26, 2022 while attempting to exploit CVE-202227925 and CVE-2022-37042\n\n207.148.76[.]235\n\nA Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) domain\n\n209.141.56[.]190\n\nNew Sept ember 27, 2022\n\nUpdate August 23, 2022: Deploy Snort signatures to detect malicious activity:\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA: HTTP POST content data '.jsp'\nfile'\"; sid:x; flow:established,to_server; content:\"POST\"; http_method;\ncontent:\"|2f|service|2f|extension|2f|backup|2f|mboximport\"; nocase;\nhttp_uri; content:\"file|3a|\"; nocase; http_client_body; content:\"|2e|jsp\";\nhttp_client_body; fast_pattern; classtype:http-content; reference:cve,202230333;)\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA: Client HTTP Header 'QIHU\n360SE'\"; sid:x; flow:established,to_server; content:\"POST\"; http_method;\ncontent:\"|2f|service|2f|extension|2f|backup|2f|mboximport\"; nocase;\nhttp_uri; content:\"QIHU|20|360SE\"; nocase; http_header; fast_pattern;\nclasstype:http-header; reference:cve,2022-30333;)\nalert tcp any any -> any any (msg:\"ZIMBRA:HTTP GET URI for Zimbra Local\nConfig\"; sid:x; flow:established,to_server;\ncontent:\"/public/jsp/runas.jsp?pwd=zim&i=/opt/zimbra/bin/zmlocalconfig|3a|s\"; http_uri; classtype:http-uri; reference:cve,2022-30333;)\n\n•\n\nDeploy third-party YARA rules to detect malicious activity:\no See Volexity’s Mass Exploitation of (Un)authenticated Zimbra RCE: CVE-2022-27925\n\nMITIGATIONS\nCISA and the MS-ISAC recommend organizations upgrade to the latest ZCS releases as noted on\nZimbra Security – News & Alerts and Zimbra Security Advisories.\nSee Volexity’s Mass Exploitation of (Un)authenticated Zimbra RCE: CVE-2022-27925 for mitigation\nsteps.\n\nPage 4 of 6 | Product ID: AA22-228A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nCISA | MS-ISAC\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nAdditionally, CISA and the MS-ISAC recommend organizations apply the following best practices to\nreduce risk of compromise:\n•\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nMaintain and test an incident response plan.\nEnsure your organization has a vulnerability management program in place and that it\nprioritizes patch management and vulnerability scanning of known exploited vulnerabilities.\nNote: CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Services (CyHy) are free to all state, local, tribal, and territorial\n(SLTT) organizations, as well as public and private sector critical infrastructure organizations:\ncisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services.\nProperly configure and secure internet-facing network devices.\no Do not expose management interfaces to the internet.\no Disable unused or unnecessary network ports and protocols.\no Disable/remove unused network services and devices.\nAdopt zero-trust principles and architecture, including:\no Micro-segmenting networks and functions to limit or block lateral movements.\no Enforcing phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users and VPN\nconnections.\no Restricting access to trusted devices and users on the networks.\n\nINCIDENT RESPONSE\nIf an organization’s system has been compromised by active or recently active threat actors in their\nenvironment, CISA and the MS-ISAC recommend the following initial steps:\n1. Collect and review artifacts, such as running processes/services, unusual authentications,\nand recent network connections.\n2. Quarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts.\n3. Reimage compromised hosts.\n4. Provision new account credentials.\n5. Report the compromise to CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or\n888-282-0870). SLTT government entities can also report to the MS-ISAC\n(SOC@cisecurity.org or 866-787-4722).\nSee the joint CSA from the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United\nKingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious\nActivity for additional guidance on hunting or investigating a network, and for common mistakes in\nincident handling. CISA and the MS-ISAC also encourage government network administrators to see\nCISA’s Federal Government Cybersecurity Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks. Although\ntailored to federal civilian branch agencies, these playbooks provide operational procedures for\nplanning and conducting cybersecurity incident and vulnerability response activities and detail steps\nfor both incident and vulnerability response.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nCISA and the MS-ISAC would like to thank Volexity and Secureworks for their contributions to this\nadvisory.\n\nPage 5 of 6 | Product ID: AA22-228A\n\nTLP: WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | MS-ISAC\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.
