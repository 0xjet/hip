Over the last few years, the impact has worsened due to adversaries moving to a more\ntargeted attack method, rather than the traditional “spray and pray” method of infecting as many potential victims as possible.\n\nThis up-front investment in time and resources has shown to be fruitful for attackers, especially as they focus on specific industries,\nwith [healthcare as well as states and local governments emerging as high-profile targets during the course of 2020. The latest](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/industries/healthcare?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=healthcare)\n[industry targeted with ransomware is Industrial Control Systems/Operational Technology. This blog will break down at a high level the](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/industries/scada-industrial-control-systems/what-is-ot-security?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=scada-industrial-control-systems/what-is-ot-security)\nlatest EKANS ransomware, general TTP trends, and related protections for targeted ransomware attacks.\n\n**Affected platforms: Windows Operating Systems**\n\n**Impacted parties: Industrial Control Systems and a variety of applications**\n\n**Impact: Data Encryption for Impact – Mitre ID:T1486**\n**Severity level: High**\n\n## EKANS Ransomware\n\n[Through one of our trusted partnerships, FortiGuard Labs was provided with an EKANS sample to analyze around the end of May. A](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=campaign&utm_campaign=FortiGuardLabs)\nmore recent June version was independently sourced by FortiGuard Labs.\n\n**MD5** **SHA256**\n\n**May Variant**\n\n47EBE9F8F5F73F07D456EC12BB49C75D 2ED3E37608E65BE8B6E8C59F8C93240BD0EFE9A60C08C21F4889C00EB6082D74\n\n**June Variant**\n\n**ED3C05BDE9F0EA0F1321355B03AC42D0** D4DA69E424241C291C173C8B3756639C654432706E7DEF5025A649730868C4A1\n\n\n-----\n\nEach of these samples are written in the GO programming language. The GO programming language first appeared around 2009\nand has slowly gained popularity within the malware community.\n\n## The Difficulty of Analyzing EKANS Malware - “Go”ing to Create a Custom IDA Plugin\n\nOne of the advantages of GO is that the code can be easily compiled to work on different platforms and architectures, such as\nMacOS, Microsoft Windows, and the Linux operating system when compared to other programming languages. One of the\ndisadvantages, however, is that the binaries are noticeably larger in size. A simple “Hello World” program can produce a binary 1 MB\nin size. To combat bulky file sizes, GO allows a programmer to strip binaries during compilation. Most of the information that gets\nremoved is typically used by debuggers.\n\nAs it turns out, this size problem is actually helpful to malware authors. By having a larger file size, manual analysis will inevitably\ntake longer. Moreover, it can easily be overlooked since typical malware files have a much smaller file size in the first place. By\nstripping the binaries of debugging information, malware analysts will have another stumbling block to overcome.\n\nLooking at the given files closer, we can see that they are indeed stripped and offer no clues for the malware analyst.\n\nFigure 1. Number of Functions to Analyze\n\nThe typical malware may have hundreds of functions, and some will already be recognized in the malware analysis industry’s\nunofficial default disassembler, IDA. With stripped GO binaries, however, IDA is unable to recognize normal library files, leaving the\nmalware analyst with more than 5000 functions to sift through.\n\nBecause of this problem, we developed an EKANS-specific IDA plugin in-house to help with analysis in conjunction with other GOspecific analysis techniques.\n\nFigure 2. Custom IDA Plugin Developed by FortiGuard Labs\n\nAs can be seen above, there are over 2100 encrypted strings, almost 2400 obfuscated function names, and over 1200 strings that\nneeded fixing in the May variant of EKANS.\n\n[Both of these variants perform all of the typical ransomware activities you would expect, such as encrypting files and leaving a](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/encryption?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=encryption)\nransom note telling the victim to contact them at a specified email address, to receive instructions on how to pay a ransom and\ndecrypt their files. But they also perform actions that are not so typical. Below is a high-level list of these activities in sequence, with\nthe main notable difference of turning off the host [firewall, found in the June variant:](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/firewall?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=firewall)\n\nConfirms Target Environment\nIsolates the Infected System (Host Firewall)\nThe public RSA Key used in the file encryption process is decoded\nIdentifies and Stops Specific Services and Processes\nDeletes Shadow Copy\nEncrypts Files\nTurns Off Host Firewall\n\nFigure 3. High-Level Flow of EKANS ransomware functions\n\nIt is important to note that turning off the host firewall seems to have been a new addition to the malware family’s functionality. This\nwas not present in the older May variant. Another interesting addition was to turn on the firewall before encrypting, probably to detect\nAVs and other defense solutions by blocking any communication from the agent.\n\n## Confirming the Target Environment for EKANS Ransomware\n\nThe ransomware starts out by attempting to confirm its target by resolving the domain belonging to the victim’s company, as well as\ncomparing the resolved domain to a specific IP. If the domain/IP is not available, the routine exits.\n\nFigure 4. Malware confirming its target\n\nLooking deeper into the environmental checks, we noticed that the May variant of EKANS tries to resolve the IP address of the\nADS.****.COM. The subdomain belongs to a global health care provider that specializes in the treatment of chronic kidney\nconditions.\n\nFigure 5. Subdomain IP Check\n\n\n-----\n\nThis subdomain does not seem to be publicly available, which means that the May variant will only execute if it has infiltrated the\nnetwork. If this is successful, then another check is performed. EKANS checks to see if “10.2.10.4” is the IP address of this\nsubdomain.\n\nFigure 6. IP Compare\n\nAnother piece of information that the May variant of EKANS is looking for is the current machine’s role within the domain.\n\nFigure 7. Domain Role Check\n\n[A WMI query will be performed to determine this. Microsoft defines domain roles as the following.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-computersystem)\n\n0 Standalone Workstation\n\n1 Member Workstation\n\n2 Standalone Server\n\n3 Member Server\n\n4 Backup Domain Controller\n\n5 Primary Domain Controller\n\nEKANS is apparently looking to infect a domain controller on the network. If successful, this can affect security authentication\nrequests within the network domain, thereby severely impacting networked users. With the aforementioned data points, EKANS will\nhave enough to build a proper mutex.\n\nFigure 8. Mutex Creation\n\nThe mutex will consist of the string “Global\\” appended with “EKANS” and a part of the IP string. On a side note, the author(s) of\nEKANS may be a fan of The Highlander movies/TV series where the phrase “there can be only one” was popularized.\n\nFigure 9. Exit Message\n\n## Isolating a System Infected by EKANS Ransomware\n\nThe next step taken by the June variant of the ransomware that FortiGuard Labs engineers encountered was that the malware\nexecuted the following netsh commands in order to block any inbound and outbound traffic that might interfere with the encryption\nprocess:\n\n_netsh advfirewall set allprofiles firewallpolicy blockinbound,blockoutbound_\n_netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on_\n\nFigure 10. Malware isolating infected system\n\nFigure 11. netsh.exe running to change host firewall settings.\n\n## Decoding EKANS Ransomware’s Public RSA Key\n\nNext, the malware goes through its encryption functions, which like many ransomware variants are embedded in the malware. It\nencrypts data using RSA and by parsing the public key using the ParsePKCS1PublicKey function. It is XOR decoded.\n\nFigure 12. RSA key decoded\n\nFigure 13. Public key being parsed by the ParsePKCS1PublicKey function\n\n## EKANS Malware Identifies and Stops Services and Processes\n\nIn both variants, EKANS will decode strings associated with services and attempt to stop them. The May variant, for some reason,\ncontains duplicate services.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Service Redundancy\n\nOverall, there are nine services that are repeatedly decrypted in an attempt to stop them by the May variant of EKANS. They are:\n\nMSSQLFDLauncher$PROFXENGAGEMENT, ReportServer$TPS, SQLBrowser, MSSQLServerADHelper, SQLAgent$PROD,\nmsftesql$PROD, SQLAgent$SOPHOS, VeeamEnterpriseManagerSvc, and ArcserveUDPPS\n\nAfter decoding all the required strings (see Appendix A), both variants of the ransomware open the SCM (OpenSCManager) and use\nEnumServicesStatusEx. It iterates on the services and stops any service contained in the decoded string list.\n\nThe service stop operation stops:\n\nOpenService (SC_MANAGER_ENUMERATE_SERVICE)\nServiceControl (SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP)\nServiceQuery\n\nFigure 15. Identifies and stops specific services.\n\n## EKANS Also Identifies and Kills Processes\n\nThe ransomware then enumerates running processes and terminates each process within a predefined process list (See AppendixB). The following code handles the process termination:\n\nFigure 16. Malware terminates specific processes.\n\n## EKANS Deletes Shadow Copies\n\nEKANS then deletes shadow copies, which is done via WMI’s WbemScripting.SWbemNamedValueSet object. The query that locates\nthe shadow copies object is the regular:\n\nSELECT * FROM Win32_ShadowCopy\n\nThis is common behavior with ransomware to make it more difficult to recover files. There are many ways to achieve this. If you’re\n[interested in learning more, please read Ben Hunter’s “Stomping Shadow Copies – A second Look into Deletion Methods” blog.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/stomping-shadow-copies-a-second-look-into-deletion-methods)\n\nThe May variant accomplishes this by using COM programming. EKANS connects to the WMI service via COM objects in order to\n[use shared libraries utilizing code similar to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-ole/go-ole/master/guid.go, which is used by various](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-ole/go-ole/master/guid.go)\nother legitimate GO software, as well as other malicious binaries.\n\nFigure 17. COM Objects Used\n\n## EKANS Ransomware Encrypts Files\n\nBefore running the encryption function, the ransomware decodes the strings of all of the relevant file extensions to encrypt, (see\nAppendix-C).\n\nIn order to keep the system able to at least spin up and load, certain files and folders are skipped from the encrypting process. These\nfiles are avoided in the May variant of EKANS.\n\nFigure18. Files Avoided by the May Variant\n\nAt the same time, any files and folders that contain the following directories in their path are also skipped from the file encryption\nprocess by the May variant.\n\nFigure 19. Folders Avoided by May Variant\n\nThe following file types are also avoided by the May variant.\n\nFigure 20. File types Avoided by May Variant\n\nBoth variants also build the following regex used to exclude encryption targets.\n\nFigure 21. Malware excluding encryption targets\n\nHowever, during the actual file encryption process, the list of targeted file types is not actually checked by the May variant of the\nransomware The May variant will encrypt any file type as long as it does not violate any of its avoidance rules\n\n\n-----\n\nThe encryption details seem identical to the operating methods described here: https://www.ccn cert.cni.es/pdf/5045 ccn cert id 15\n20-snake-locker-english-1/file.html\n\nA public RSA key is used to encrypt each of the AES keys used to encrypt files.\nFile encryption is via AES CTR mode, with a random key and a random IV.\nThe AES key is ciphered with RSA-OAEP, and uses ripemd160 as its hashing algorithm.\nThe AES encrypted key, along with the original file name, is encoded using GOB (an algorithm from Golang), and it is written at\nthe end of the file.\n\nFirst, it enumerates all valid drive letters from A to Z using GetLogicalDriveStringsW.\n\nFigure 22. Drive Enumeration\n\nInterestingly enough, the code shown in the figure below shows that the May variant of EKANS only targets removable drives (such\nas thumb drives) and fixed drives (such as hard disks or flash storage devices). They do not try to infect machines on the network.\n\nFigure 23. Drive Types Targeted\n\nIt then creates multiple threads for such drives.\n\nFigure 24. Enumerating valid drive letters.\n\nEach thread then creates eight workers (threads) that perform the encryption. These workers use channels to sync themselves.\n\nFigure 25. Threads performing encryption\n\nAfter creating the eight workers, the thread waits for them to finish. After all of them are done, it renames the files on the system by\ngenerating a random 5-digits string which is then appended to the file’s name.\n\nFigure 26. Malware renaming files.\n\nThe single file encryption flow is relatively simple:\n\nOpens a file\nChecks to see if it already has the EKANS stamp at the file’s end. If not, it encrypts the file via AES as seen in the following\nloop:\nEncryption (it overwrites the file, not creating a new one)\n\nFirst, initiates a cipher:\n\nFigure 27. Malware initiates Cipher\n\nAfter the encryption process has completed, the May variant of EKANS drops the ransom note as “Decrypt-Your-Files.txt” either on\nthe root system drive or on the user’s desktop.\n\nFigure 28. Ransom Note\n\n## Finally, EKANS Turns Off Host Firewall\n\nFor machines infected with the June variant, the ransomware ends with another command to turn off the firewall.\n\n## EKANS Mitre TTPs\n\nExecution\n\nComponent Object Model and Distributed COM (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1175)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1175/)\n\nEKANS executes WMI queries via COM objects\n\nDefense Evasion\n\nDisabling Security Tools (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1089)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1089/)\n\nEKANS attempts to disable processes and kill services (see Appendix)\nExecution Guardrails (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1480)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/)\n\nEKANS will check network, IP, and domain role\n\n\n-----\n\nIndirect Command Execution (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1202)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202/)\n\nnetsh advfirewall set allprofiles firewallpolicy blockinbound,blockoutbound\nnetsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1497)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/)\n\nEKANS attempts to disable virtualization services and processes (see Appendix)\n\nDiscover\n\nFile and Directory Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1083)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\n\nEKANS builds a list of files and directories that need to be encrypted\n\nPeripheral Device Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1120)\n\nEKANS will attempt to encrypt files on removable drives such as USB drives\n\nProcess Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1057)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)\n\nEKANS will attempt to terminate certain processes (see Appendix)\n\nSecurity Software Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1063)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063/)\n\nEKANS will attempt to disable certain security software (see Appendix)\n\nSoftware Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1518)\n\nEKANS will attempt to disable certain ICS processes (see Appendix)\n\nSystem Information Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1082)\n\nEKANS checks for the existence of a mutex\nEKANS checks for the system’s role in the domain\n\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1049)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1049/)\n\nEKANS queries the network to see if it is part of the targeted domain\n\nSystem Service Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1007)\n\nEKANS will attempt to halt certain services (see Appendix)\n\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1497)\n\nEKANS attempts to disable virtualization services and processes (see Appendix)\n\nImpact\n\nData Encrypted for Impact (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1486)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n\nEKANS will encrypt certain files to be ransomed\n\nInhibit System Recovery (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1490)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\n\nEKANS deletes shadow copies to prevent recovery of encrypted files\n\nNetwork Denial of Service (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1498)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/)\n\nInfected domain controllers may prevent users from logging into the network\n\nService Stop (Mitre ATT&CK [ID: T1489)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489/)\n\nEKANS will attempt to halt certain services (see Appendix)\n\n## General TTP Trends\n\n[Understanding the ransomware and some of its indicators of compromise (IOC), such as hashes, URLs, IP addresses, and domains](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/indicators-of-compromise?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=indicators-of-compromise)\nis a good first defense. But be warned that these IOCs often change and can circumvent legacy security controls. And because these\nattacks are more targeted, it’s also important to understand the activity the offensive operator takes once they’re in the environment.\nIf you can disrupt their plans prior to the malware executing, the better off you will be. While every targeted attack is unique, there are\nsome trends – especially in the way an attacker works – that if understood can provide a better view into your ability to detect their\nattack methods and more effectively block them.\n\nLet’s take a look into some of the trends we often see from our FortiGuard Managed Detection and Response and Incident Response\nServices.\n\n### Initial Access\n\nThere are many ways to access a network but the two we continue to observe are:\n\n\n-----\n\nExternal Remote Services (Mitre ATT&CK [ID:T1133)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/)\n\nExploiting existing vulnerabilities and weak credentials on RDP sessions that are publicly exposed.\nSpear phishing Attachments and Links (Mitre ATT&CK [ID:T1193 and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/) [ID:T1192)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192/)\n\nThe malware delivery of choice these days is still by sending a spear phishing email.\n\n### OS Credential Dumping\n\nOnce the adversary establishes their initial access into the environment, they need to continue penetrating deeper into the network.\nTo do so, they first need the right access, which is why credential dumping is a common activity. There are many techniques to\nachieve the dumping of credentials, as the Windows Operating System has many different places it stores or caches its credentials.\nBelow is one common technique we see as a trend:\n\nOS Credential Dumping – LSASS Memory (Mitre ATT&CK [ID:T1003.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1003/001/)\n\nThe LSASS process stores credentials of users that are logged in to a system. Many tools are available to extract this\ncredential information.\n\nIf you want to read more on OS Credential Dumping, please view our Offense and Defense – A Tale of Two Sides: (Windows) OS\nCredential Dumping blog.\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nWhen the adversary has the right access to spread their malware from system to system, they simply need to copy and remotely\nexecute the payload. One tool that can achieve just that is found on many Windows Operating Systems. It is called PSEXEC, which\nis part of the Sysinternals. This tool is used by many system admins to help administer the network, but it is also often used by the\nadversary.\n\n[Lateral Tool Transfer (Mitre ID:T1570)](https://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1570/)\n\nMany tools can be used to copy and remotely execute a piece of software. The PSEXEC tool is one of them. When\npsexec.exe runs, it will copy the psexecsvc.exe file to the remote system, which is used to start and run the malicious\nsoftware as a service. It’s also worth mentioning that it will use Windows admin shares such as C$, IPS$, ADMIN$.\n\n### Defensive Evasion\n\nAs a security community we have gotten better at identifying malicious software and tools. As a result, adversaries have had to take\nthat into consideration by adding additional steps to disable defensive controls such as anti-malware, or by disabling Windows event\nlogging.\n\nImpair Defenses - Disable or Modify Tools (Mitre [ID:T1562.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1562/001/)\n\nIf the adversary has administrator access it may be possible to uninstall or shutdown services such as Microsoft Defender.\nThey will uninstall the service, run their malware, and then reinstall the services.\n[Impair Defenses - Disable Windows Event Logging (Mitre ID:T1562.002)](https://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1562/002/)\n\nLogs are a great source for detecting anomalies on your hosts, and companies are collecting these logs centrally and\nmonitoring them for those anomalies. To address this process, adversaries will disable event logging or suppress logs so\nthey can’t be viewed by the monitoring tool or process.\n\n### Defensive Evasion/Privilege Escalation/Persistence\n\nEventually, the attacker will execute the ransomware (or malware in general) on targeted systems. An efficient way to do this, if the\nattacker has access to the domain controllers, is to leverage group policies (GPO) and Windows login scripts. GPOs and login scripts\nare used by system admins for central management and OS configuration setting for users’ environments. These tools, which are\npart of an Active Directory environment, are modified by an attacker to deploy and execute their malware.\n\n[Group Policy Modification (GPO) (Mitre ID:T1484)](https://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1484/)\n\nThe attacker can create a group policy preference scheduled task policy within a Default Domain Policy that will deliver\nthe malware and execute it on all machines within the AD domain.\n[Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: Login Script – Windows (Mitre ID:T1037.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1037/001/)\n\nBecause logon scripts can be run when users login to systems in an AD domain, an attacker can add their malicious\npayload to the script to execute.\n\n## Conclusion: Prepare for Ransomware Threats Beyond EKANS\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this blog we focused on not only one of the latest ransomware variants targeting ICS/OT environments, but also some of the TTP\ntrends our FortiGuard team has observed over the last year or two. We encourage you to take a look at not only the techniques we\n[described here, but also at the other techniques that are documented in the Mitre ATT&CK knowledge base. Then start testing your](https://attack.mitre.org/)\ncurrent security controls against these techniques to ensure you can detect or protect against them.\n\nIf you find gaps, document them and use them as a guide to build a prioritized action plan for improvement. Lastly, if you are\n[responsible for the ICS environment there is now a Mitre ATT&CK ICS knowledge base specifically for adversary actions taking place](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Main_Page)\nin an Industrial Control System network.\n\n## How Fortinet Protects Organizations from EKANS\n\nFortinet offers a suite of platforms and services to help protect organizations from ransomware and malware, including EKANS.\nHere’s how it works:\n\n### FortiEDR Platform: Identification & Blocking of EKANS\n\nFortinet’s [FortiEDR Platform detects and blocks the EKANS malware.
