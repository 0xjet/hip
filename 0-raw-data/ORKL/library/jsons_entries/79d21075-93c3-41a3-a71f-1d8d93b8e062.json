A customer engagement early-to-mid-2017 is an excellent**\n\n**example of a unique case in which RSA IR successfully responded to an intrusion**\n\n**perpetrated by the threat actor group** **[CARBANAK](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkrebsonsecurity.com%2Ftag%2Fcarbanak%2F)** **, also known as FIN7. The**\n\n**CARBANAK actions illustrated in this post and associated paper were observed with**\n\n**other RSA clients as recently as November 2017, with the methods and intelligence**\n\n\n**supplied by these publications having been used successfully to detect and track**\n\n\n**attacker activities.**\n\n\n**Several intrusions associated with the CARBANAK actors have been reported within the last**\n\n**[year, describing compromises of organizations within banking](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bankinfosecurity.com%2Fsophisticated-carbanak-banking-malware-returns-upgrades-a-8523)** **[, financial�](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkrebsonsecurity.com%2F2017%2F03%2Fpayments-giant-verifone-investigating-breach%2F)** **[, hospitality](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkrebsonsecurity.com%2F2017%2F10%2Fhyatt-hotels-suffers-2nd-card-breach-in-2-years%2F)** **,**\n\n**[and restaurant](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scmagazine.com%2Fcarbanak-backdoor-malware-targeting-us-restaurant-chains%2Farticle%2F680041%2F)** **verticals. However, they all describe a relatively equivalent progression,**\n\n**with only slight deviation in specific attacker actions. The intelligence surrounding�**\n\n**[recent CARBANAK incidents indicate that phishing attacks](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fireeye.com%2Fblog%2Fthreat-research%2F2017%2F03%2Ffin7_spear_phishing.html)** **have been the groupʼs**\n\n**primary method of initial compromise. After gaining access to a user system, the attackers**\n\n**move laterally throughout the environment, conduct internal reconnaissance, establish**\n\n**staging points and internal network paths, harvest credentials, and move towards their**\n\n\n-----\n\n**attackers to quickly gain administrative access within the clientʼs Linux environment. This**\n\n**intrusion presented substantial challenges due to:**\n\n**The initial intrusion vector**\n\n**Unique attacker toolset**\n\n**The attacker dwell time**\n\n**The large, heterogeneous environment**\n\n**The speed with which the attackers gained administrative access**\n\n**The forensic mindfulness of the CARBANAK attackers**\n\n**The attackersʼ toolset was a mix of custom tools, freely available code, and open source**\n\n**software utilities. RSA IR researched all 32 of the malicious files in the� CARBANAK toolset**\n\n**using various publicly available and open-source resources. Six of the tools used in this**\n\n**intrusion were found to have been uploaded to a publicly available anti-virus aggregation**\n\n**site. Of these six, five have little-to-no detection or indication of malice from antivirus�**\n\n**vendors. This observation explains why the clientʼs signature-based host protection**\n\n**mechanisms were unable to identify or prevent the use of these tools.**\n\n**Figure 1: Findings from Public and Open Source Research of Toolset Reference**\n\n**While the attackers used more than 30 unique samples of malware and tools, they also**\n\n**demonstrated a normalization across Windows and Linux with respect to their toolset. The**\n\n**toolsets they deployed can be broken down into five basic functionalities:�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Log Cleanup**\n\n**Credential Harvesting**\n\n**Internal Reconnaissance**\n\n**The ingress, lateral movement, and internal reconnaissance mechanisms used by the**\n\n**attackers during this investigation were not that sophisticated in and of themselves.**\n\n**However, when viewed in aggregate, and from an operational view, RSA observed the actors**\n\n**normalized their choice in toolset across the Linux and Windows environments. The**\n\n**attackers in this engagement primarily used modified versions of legitimate administrative�**\n\n**tools, commonly used penetration testing utilities, and common network file acquisition�**\n\n**tools. Though specialty malware was observed during this intrusion, the attackers used**\n\n**basic XOR encoding just above Layer 4 to facilitate communication, communicated via SSH**\n\n**tunnel directly over TCP/443, or just transmitted and received data in clear text across the**\n\n**network. Of the observed actions during this intrusion, none of the attacker tools,**\n\n**techniques, or procedures were particularly advanced. However, they were still able to**\n\n**bypass a significant security stack, obtain initial access and lateral access effectively, deploy**\n\n**malware and toolsets with impunity, and traverse over 150 systems in the span of six**\n\n**weeks. While, at first glance, this attack was not sophisticated in its toolset, it was�**\n\n**sophisticated in its operationalization and agility of attackersʼ actions. The correlations**\n\n**between the Linux environment tools and the Windows environment tools are shown below:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**p**\n\n**Linux** **Windows** **Function**\n\n**Winexe** **Tinyp (PSEXEC** **Lateral Movement**\n\n**Variant)**\n\n**Auditunnel (Linux** **Auditunnel** **Ingress Tunneling**\n\n**Version)** **(Windows Version)**\n\n**PScan (Linux** **PScan (Windows** **Internal Recon**\n\n**Version)** **Version)**\n\n**WGet (Linux** **WGet (Windows** **Toolset Download**\n\n**Version)** **Version)**\n\n**SCP** **PSCP** **File Transfer**\n\n**[RSA IR released a white paper](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rsa.com%2Fen-us%2Fresources%2Finside-the-response-of-a-unique-carbanak-intrusion-white-paper)** **containing an in-depth review of this engagement,**\n\n**including observed attacker operational patterns, TTPs, and the techniques used during this**\n\n**engagement to successfully track and respond to the threat. The observations illustrated in**\n\n**this paper identify that not only do CARBANAK actors have the capability to successfully**\n\n**compromise various operating system environments, they have standardized and**\n\n**operationalized this capability. This attribute indicates strategic operational thought and**\n\n**effort being invested in this groupʼs compromises, suggesting that the� CARBANAK actors**\n\n**are working towards becoming a more organized, structured, resourceful, and mature**\n\n**threat group.**\n\n**During an intrusion, time is the single most critical resource to an organizationʼs security**\n\n**team and is the most significant indicator of determining if the security team will be�**\n\n**successful in containing, eradicating, and remediating the extant threat. There are two**\n\n**specific sets of time related to an intrusion that may determine the difference between�**\n\n**success and failure: the time that the attackers are in the environment prior to detection**\n\n**(dwell time), and the time it takes security teams to identify, investigate, understand, and**\n\n**contain the attackerʼs actions (response time). In this specific incident, the attackerʼs dwell�**\n\n**time at intrusion declaration was 35 days, which is a significant amount of time given the�**\n\n**level of access immediately available upon compromise. However, by utilizing**\n\n**the** **[methodology and visibility described in this paper, RSA IR was able to complete](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/2016/12/01/new-hunting-guide-investigation-model)**\n\n|Linux|Windows|Function|\n|---|---|---|\n|Winexe|Tinyp (PSEXEC Variant)|Lateral Movement|\n|Auditunnel (Linux Version)|Auditunnel (Windows Version)|Ingress Tunneling|\n|PScan (Linux Version)|PScan (Windows Version)|Internal Recon|\n|WGet (Linux Version)|WGet (Windows Version)|Toolset Download|\n|SCP|PSCP|File Transfer|\n\n\n-----\n\n**contain the attackers before the actors could achieve their intended goal.**\n\n**The CARBANAK actors not only showed the capability to successfully compromise both**\n\n**Linux and Windows systems, they chose a toolset that was either directly cross-platform or**\n\n**extremely similar in both function and command line usage. This indicates a level of**\n\n**tactical organization and operationalization not previously observed by this actor group.**\n\n**Additionally, they were significantly cognizant and aware of actions taken by the security�**\n\n**team, switching to new methods of ingress after initial compromise, detected remediation**\n\n**actions, and environmental migration. They were methodical in their choice of staging**\n\n**systems, basing the system utilized on:**\n\n**a critical function of lateral access**\n\n**or responder detection and investigation**\n\n**They chose key systems based on their needs rather than systems the organization would**\n\n**consider ʻkeyʼ assets. They ensured the toolsets they would interact with most often**\n\n**contained very similar functions and commands across environments in order to limit**\n\n**mistakes made at the keyboard. They included a method, whether manually or**\n\n**automatically, to remove any record of their activities. They operated with purpose,**\n\n**patience, planning, and most significantly, persistence.�**\n\n**This intrusion was successfully discovered, investigated, contained, eradicated, and**\n\n**remediated only due to the following reasons:**\n\n**1. The organization invested in the necessary visibility at a host and network level to**\n\n**allow analysts to rapidly and effectively hunt for and investigate these types of�**\n\n**threats.**\n\n**2. The organization had invested and empowered their personnel to creatively and**\n\n**proactively hunt for, understand, investigate, and learn from threats within their**\n\n**environment.**\n\n**3. The organization had maintained a relationship with a proven and trusted advisory**\n\n**practice and had worked to recreate and implement a solid and proven** **Threat**\n\n**Hunting and Incident Response methodology within their own organization.**\n\n**4. The organization had a solid top-down understanding of what role Threat Hunting**\n\n**and Incident Response held during daily operations and security incidents, and**\n\n**provided the necessary support and enablement to subordinate units and analysts.**\n\n**While a first look at the tools used in this engagement may appear simplistic, upon review�**\n\n**of the entire intrusion, it becomes quickly apparent that each of them was purpose-chosen**\n\n**with an overall operationalized capability in mind. CARBANAK has shown themselves to be**\n\n**a coordinated and extremely persistent group of actors that are consistently moving**\n\n**towards more agile methods of intrusion and standardization of processes across**\n\n\n-----\n\n**agility to defeat or bypass organizational security controls. Even with the least advanced of**\n\n**their capabilities, they can be a difficult adversary to track within an environment due to�**\n\n**their speed, efficiency, adaptability, and care in leaving little trace of any activity. However,�**\n\n**this difficulty compounds exponentially for organizations without the necessary visibility,�**\n\n**practices, methodologies, or trusted partner relationships necessary to effectively detect�**\n\n**and respond to these types of threats. This white paper shows that with the necessary**\n\n**visibility, planning, methodology, and analyst enablement, organizations can be successful**\n\n**against these types of threats.**\n\n**[Learn more about the Carbanak/Fin7 syndicate](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rsa.com%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fen%2Fwhite-paper%2Fthe-carbanak-fin7-syndicate.pdf)** **[based on unique Carbanak intrusions](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rsa.com%2Fen-us%2Fresources%2Finside-the-response-of-a-unique-carbanak-intrusion-white-paper)** **,**\n\n**[and the mindset](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rsa.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2F2017-07%2Finfosec-easy-button-myth)** **and** **[methods used to combat them in these recent RSA Research](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/2016/12/01/new-hunting-guide-investigation-model)**\n\n**publications.**\n\n\n**security operations and breach managem…**\n\n\n**netwitness logs & packets**\n\n\n**netwitness for endpoint**\n\n\n**incident_investigations**\n\n\n**[RSA NetWitness Logs](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/content?filterID=contentstatus[published]~category[rsa-netwitness-logs])**\n\n\n**netwitness packet**\n\n\n**analyst report**\n\n\n**threat intel**\n\n\n**intrusion**\n\n\n**fin7�**\n\n\n**Related Content**\n\n**ESA - Intrusion Detection with Windows Event Logs**\n\n**Detecting APT Using Anomalous Windows Remote Management Methods and Dynamic RPC**\n**Endpoint Mapping**\n\n**Recent resurgence in Shamoon**\n\n**ANOTHER HOLIDAY LOST … WannaCry and Wanna Decryptor**\n\n**Another great threat Profile...
