I picked this strain because I\nwould like a bit more of a challenge in terms of obfuscation and anti-disassembly techniques, so strap in for this OG\nRansomware\n\nLocky (at least the first few versions) is said to be created by the makers of the Dridex/Cridex banking trojans. For example\nthe spreading mechanism via macros in Word or Excel documents sent out via carefully crafted spear-phishing emails is\nexactly the same for both of these strains.\n\n**_A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below will lead to the encryption of_**\n**_your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources_**\n**_might be illegal depending on where you live._**\n\n### Todays samples are brought to you by:\n\n[Locky #1 available @ https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/tree/master/malwares/Binaries/Ransomware.Locky](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/tree/master/malwares/Binaries/Ransomware.Locky) `sha256`\n```\nbc98c8b22461a2c2631b2feec399208fdc4ecd1cd2229066c2f385caa958daa3\n\n```\n[Locky.AZ available @ https://dasmalwerk.eu/](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dasmalwerk/downloads/2e4319ff62c03a539b2b2f71768a0cfc0adcaedbcca69dbf235081fe2816248b/2e4319ff62c03a539b2b2f71768a0cfc0adcaedbcca69dbf235081fe2816248b.zip) `sha256`\n```\n2e4319ff62c03a539b2b2f71768a0cfc0adcaedbcca69dbf235081fe2816248b\n\n```\nRunning\n\nthis first Locky Sample was pretty unspectacular since nothing really happend 🤔. Let's take a look at the binary first:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nWould\n\nyou look at that! We found ourselves some poor mans obfuscation :D A whole bunch of random strings to make the analyst's\nlife just a little bit harder. We'll come back to this later to see if we can simplify our strings output a bit.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter a couple of seconds it spawns a new svchost.exe process with the same icon as Locky.exe had previously. Of course\nwe'll dump the process memory to a file (just right-click the listing in Process Hacker and choose Create dump from the\n\ncontext menu).\n\nLooking at the properties of the new svchost.exe process we can see that it is actually run from\nC:\\Users\\IEUser\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ and it's unsigned as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Trojan.Ransom.Locky.AZ\n\nhttps://www.hybridanalysis.com/sample/2e4319ff62c03a539b2b2f71768a0cfc0adcaedbcca69dbf235081fe2816248b/5cd5813d028838383d3ab408\n\n\n-----\n\nThis article is a work in progress, updates going to follow soon\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Locky (SHA256)\n```\n2e4319ff62c03a539b2b2f71768a0cfc0adcaedbcca69dbf235081fe2816248b\n5ed2f09e648dca8f0ca75466b1442f6e599afddc80777e0559fb6881c6cd9ff3\n3b60fde281d91cc3e7ea3e343ee5b13a31def564903c0136ae928f70e25c3c02\n6afc78b5630726c907a69d62a6c8a7d86326e21383fe3aae1efc715342238e02\n\n```\n\n-----",
