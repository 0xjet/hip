Also known as PROJECTM and MYTHIC LEOPARD, the group is highly\nactive and has been engaged in conducting various cyber espionage campaigns.\nThe APT group is suspected to be politically motivated, as its victims include defense and\ndiplomatic professionals. One of the tools used in its campaigns is a .NET RAT (Remote\nAccess Trojan) also known as Crimson RAT. The group was seen to be operating with\nan updated version of Crimson RAT discovered recently, consisting of a malicious macro\nembedded in a word file that upon execution drops a payload to set up a communication\nchannel with a Command-and-Control Server (C2/C&C Server).\n\nTable 1 consists of details of Transparent Tribe.\n\nAliases PROJECTM and MYTHIC LEOPARD\n\nTarget Afghanistan and India\n\n_Table 1: Details of Transparent Tribe_\n\nThe image below depicts the infection flow of Crimson RAT.\n\n_Figure 1: Infection Flow of Crimson RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Case 1:**\n\nTransparent Tribes’ campaigns begin with the delivery of a malicious document file\non the targeted victim system, and upon\nopening the malcrafted document that has embedded macro, users receive a notification\nregarding a security concern and are instructed to give a consent for enabling the content.\n\nFigure 2 depicts the word file embedded with malicious macro.\n\n_Figure 2: Malicious word file_\n\nAs the infection flow starts off from the execution of the word macro, we were on the lookout\nfor more information regarding the malicious macro. As\nper OLE Object analysis, the Autoexecution of the Document_open function leads\nto the payload delivery and its subsequent execution on the victim’s machine.\n\nFigure 3 showcases the keywords extracted from the malicious word macro.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Keywords used in word macro._\n\nIn Figure 4, we can see that the name of the payload file is dubbed as “railthnsrqn” in the\nmacro, along with the use of ALLUSERPROFILE variable, which indicates that the payload\nmight get dropped in C:\\ProgramData.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: File creation_\n\nThe macro checks for the OS (Operating System) version, and based on whether it is 32-bit\nor 64-bit, it accordingly selects the payload.\n\n_Figure 5: OS version detection_\n\nThe payload gets executed after it’s dropped using shell command.\n\n_Figure 6: Execution of the payload (railthnsrqn.exe)._\n\n**Case 2:**\n\nDuring our research, we also found a different execution technique used by the Crimson\nRAT to execute its payload. This technique does not use word macros, but a binary\nexecutable file that has an embedded word document (containing a CV file). Upon execution,\nit opens the embedded word document and silently executes its payload in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Another execution method used by Crimson RAT_\n\n_Figure 8: Embedded .doc file_\n\n**Technical analysis Case 1:**\n\nUpon behavioral analysis, it was verified that the payload file named railthnsrqn.exe was\ndropped and executed after enabling the macro.\n\n_Figure 9: railthnsrqn.exe sub process._\n\nFigure 8 depicts the process flow of railthnsrqn.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: Process flow of railthnsrqn.exe_\n\nUpon analyzing the network traffic, we found that multiple TCP requests were made to\n167.160.166.177, which turns out to be the C&C server.\n\n_Figure 11: railthnsrqn.exe trying to establish a TCP connection._\n\nWe found the following hardcoded port numbers during the decompilation of railthnsrqn.exe.\n\n_Figure 12: Hardcoded Port Numbers_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe image below showcases the code used by the payload to exfiltrating the data.\n\n_Figure 13: Data Exfiltration_\n\n_Figure 14: Capturing Screenshot_\n\nIn Figure 15, we can see the code that has been written to make changes into the registry for\npersistance and to autostart the malware payload.\n\n_Figure 15: Persistence Mechanism_\n\n**Technical analysis Case 2:**\n\nThe Figure 16 depicts the execution of payload file (othvidtiraw.exe) in the background.\n\n_Figure 16: Execution of payload(othvidtiraw.exe)_\n\nWe can see in the figure below that the payload is trying to connect to Command and Control\n(C2) server and is also accessing the registry for persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17: Process flow of othvidtiraw.exe_\n\nTable 2 consist of: MITRE ATT&CK mapping\n\nTactics Techniques Procedures\n\nExecution [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) Manual Execution by User\n\nPersistence [T1060](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060) Changes the Autorun Value in the Registry.\n\nDefense Evasion [T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140) Use of Obfuscated Macros.\n\nDiscovery [T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) Query Registry Check Environment Variables\n\nCollection [T1113](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/) [T1119](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119) Capture Screenshot Automated Collection\n\nCommand and Control [T1095](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095) [Non-application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095)\n\n_Table 2: MITRE ATT&CK mapping_\n\nThe Transparent Tribe APT group has been actively exploiting its target using an updated\ntool set. In the past, we have seen them successfully carrying out their\ncampaigns on defense and diplomatic personnel. The use of new attack techniques helps an\nattacker to evade security mechanisms, thereby establishing more persistence on the victim\nnetwork. Individuals are advised to enhance security controls to overcome these new TTPs\nused by hackers. So far, we have not heard of Transparent Tribe exploiting general public,\nhowever, most of victims of the APT group seem to have some relation with Afghanistan or\nIndia.\n\nCyble will continue to track APT activities to collect advanced threat intelligence related\nto such campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Our recommendations:**\n\nWe recommend blocking the listed hashes, URLs, and other indicators on your security\nsystems shared in the IoC list below.\nNever share personal information, including financial information over the phone, email,\nor SMSs.\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\n\nRegularly monitor your financial transactions, and if you notice any suspicious activity,\ncontact your bank immediately.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other\nconnected devices wherever possible and pragmatic.\nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected\ndevices, including PC, laptop, and mobile.\nPeople concerned about their exposure to the Dark web can register\nat [AmiBreached.com to ascertain their exposure.](https://amibreached.com/)\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their\nauthenticity.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n\nTable 3 includes Indicators of Compromise (IOC).\n\n**TYPE** **VALUE**\n\nHASH d40b8c55edf7d7f118650135ee37080e8e296e635af5481e1a2850088524196c\n\nHASH 012eba6182006cf9772ff509896fc2a929b5fe3062f29ed70c451c8ebd393d27\n\nHASH e16df177681e356ab8a9491e841fa1a757bc40069e2f42493b9238f0584cb9f1\n\nHASH 2db4365498a82081bce864196207c9478da3466167291ff7f36f93c9483fa624\n\nHASH 3e9d94714c78d02eedc5f9085982edd5b840950e65702d8ee1544b643733570b\n\nHASH 4c8e0459524380a9f00ffc58913f461c3e1d8737dd18252881f09e2d416e4f73\n\nIP 167.86.89.53\n\nIP 167.160.166.177\n\n_Table 3: Indicators of Compromise_\n\n**About Cyble:**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cyble is a global threat intelligence SaaS provider that helps enterprises protect themselves](https://cyble.io/)\nfrom cybercrimes and exposure in the darkweb.
