These tools have been part of a highly targeted intelligence gathering campaign we believe is\n\noperated by members of the Pakistani military. Our investigation indicates this actor has used these surveillanceware tools\n\nto successfully compromise the mobile devices of government officials, members of the military, medical professionals, and\n\ncivilians. To date, we have observed Stealth Mango being deployed against victims in Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Iraq, Iran,\n\nand the United Arab Emirates. The surveillanceware also retrieved sensitive data from individuals and groups in the United States,\n\nAustralia, and the United Kingdom. These individuals and groups were not themselves targeted, but interacted with individuals\n\nwhose devices had been compromised by Stealth Mango or Tangelo. We believe that the threat actor behind Stealth Mango is\n\n[also behind Op C Major and Transparent Tribe.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/indian-military-personnel-targeted-by-information-theft-campaign/)\n\n\nAt present, we have analyzed over 15 gigabytes of data taken from compromised devices, the majority of which is\n\ninformation that would be relevant to a nation state actor performing espionage activities. Content includes:\n\n\n\n- Letters and internal government communications\n\n- Detailed travel information\n\n- Pictures of IDs and passports\n\n- GPS coordinates of pictures and devices\n\n\n\n- Legal and medical documents\n\n- Developer information including whiteboard\n\nsessions, account information, and test devices\n\n- Photos of the military, government, and related officials\n\nfrom closed door meetings including U.S. Army personnel\n\n\nThe server infrastructure supporting this operation had several operational security shortcomings that allowed Lookout to\n\nretrieve compromised content. This included the presence of the web shell software WSO 2.5 hackers commonly use to maintain\n\nremote access to a server. It’s unclear whether WSO was installed by a third-party actor that successfully compromised this site or\n\nif the operators behind Stealth Mango installed and configured it themselves.\n\n[As was the case with previous actors we’ve reported on, such as Dark Caracal, the actor behind Stealth Mango has stolen a](https://www.lookout.com/info/ds-dark-caracal-ty)\n\nsignificant amount of sensitive data from compromised devices without the need to resort to exploits of any kind. The actors rely\n\non social engineering to infect target devices and have previously hosted Stealth Mango samples on their own fake app store.\n\nAnalysis of exfiltrated data suggests that physical access may also play a role.\n\nWe have also identified, as part of this investigation, several individuals who we believe are responsible for the development of\n\nother commodity Android spyware tools that share many similarities to Stealth Mango. These individuals all belong to the same\n\nfreelance developer group for hire, which says it has a physical presence in India, Pakistan, and the United States.\n\nCurrently, it is unclear when Stealth Mango was first deployed, however it is being actively developed with the latest release as\n\nrecently as April 2018. Additionally, we discovered an iOS component named Tangelo that may be responsible for the exfiltrated\n\niOS data we observed, but we are unsure if it has been used directly in this campaign or if it is still in development and testing.\n\nThe Lookout Security Intelligence team alerted Google to the existence of Stealth Mango during our investigation. The company\n\nstates: “Google identified the apps associated with this actor, none of the apps were on the Google Play Store. Google Play Protect\n\nhas been updated to protect user devices from these apps and is in the process of removing them from all affected devices.”\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key findings\n\n**Lookout researchers have identified a new mobile malware family called Stealth Mango.**\n\n - Our research shows that Stealth Mango is being actively managed by Pakistani based actors that are likely military.\n\n - Stealth Mango is being used in targeted surveillance operations against government officials, members of\n\nthe military, and activists in Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n - We determined that government officials and civilians from the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom,\n\nand Iran had their data indirectly compromised after they interacted with Stealth Mango victims.\n\n - The actors behind Stealth Mango typically lure victims via phishing, but they may also have physical access to victims’ devices.\n\n - The attacker has multi-platform capabilities. We know of the Android component and there is evidence\n\nof an iOS component. The evidence is as follows:\n\n      - A sample Debian package on attacker infrastructure called Tangelo\n\n      - EXIF data from exfiltrated content showed data from iPhones\n\n      - WHOIS information from the attackers show registrations for the following domains:\n```\n      iphonespyingsoftware[.]org, iphonespyingapps[.]org, and iphonespyingapps[.]info\n\n```\n**We have identified over 15 gigabytes of compromised data on attacker infrastructure.**\n\n - Exfiltrated content includes call records, audio recordings, device location information, text messages, and photos.\n\n - We found attacker infrastructure running the WSO web shell, which provides a third party with complete control\n\nover the server.\n\n - The actor deploying Stealth Mango appears to have a primarily mobile-focused capability.\n\n**Stealth Mango and Tangelo appear to have been created by freelance developers with physical presences in**\n\n**Pakistan, India, and the United States.**\n\n - These individuals belong to the same developer group.\n\n - We linked their tooling to several commodity mobile surveillance tools suggesting that they are either sharing code\n\nor have engaged with several distinct customers who are being delivered tooling based off similar source code.\n\n**As part of this investigation Lookout is releasing numerous IOCs related to this actor and the Stealth Mango surveillanceware family.**\n\n\n\n- 38 APK hashes\n\n- 14 IP addresses\n\n\n\n- 6 domain names\n\n- 2 iOS Mach-O hashes\n\n\n\n- 1 iOS Debian hash\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Threat summary\n\n|Name|Stealth Mango|\n|---|---|\n|Country of origin|Pakistan|\n|Threat actor|Group or individuals that are believed to belong to the Pakistani military.

To date, this investigation has identified over 15 gigabytes of\n\nexfiltrated data on command and control servers. This data includes text messages, contact details, package info, geolocation\n\ndata, audio recordings, photos, and videos from both victim and test devices. We believe Stealth Mango developers regularly\n\nrelease new versions of their tooling, with the most recent version dating April 2018. Throughout this period they’ve continued to\n\nretrieve data from compromised devices.\n\nAnalysis of exfiltrated data found it to be comprised of personal content but also more sensitive information that included:\n\n - A letter from the High Commission for Pakistan to the United States\n\nDirector of the Foreign Security Office Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n###### Type of exfiltrated content\n\n - A letter from the United States Central Command to the Afghanistan **(15 GB)**\n\nAssistant Minister of Defense for Intelligence inviting the Assistant Minister\n\nto the Annual Central and South Asia Directors of Military Intelligence\n\nConference that takes place in Tampa, Florida in February 2018.\n\n - A letter to the Pakistani Chief of Army Staff.\n\n - Documents with the letterhead for the Strategic Intelligence Deputy,\n\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan.\n\n - Details of visits to Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan by German Diplomats.\n\n - Details of visits to Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan by Australian Diplomats.\n\n###### Images 81.3%\n\n - Official Government of Pakistan notices that use the Confidential (from external storage and device camera)\n\nclassification marking and relate to an internal corruption investigation.\n\n###### Call recordings 11.2%\n\n - A user entering their personal information into the Federal Public Service\n\nCommision website of Pakistan and listing their profession as “Inspector\n\n###### Video 7.3%\n\ncustoms / Intelligence Officer.”\n\n - Photos of Afghan and Pakistani military officials.\n\n###### Environment recordings 0.1%\n\n - Content for the Regional Directorate Anti Narcotics Force Islamabad.\n\n###### Audio from\n\n - Passport photos.\n\n###### messaging apps < 0.1%\n\n - Photos of ID cards.\n\n - Photos of what we believe are from devices belonging to the developer.\n\n**Figure 1: Breakdown of the media types of exfiltrated content.**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Noteworthy exfiltrated content\n\n\n**Figure 2: A reduced snippet**\n\nof the original photo taken\n\nof exfiltrated image from\n\nthe U.S. Central Command\n\nAfghan Assistant Minister\n\nof Defense.\n\n**Figure 3: A snippet of a**\n\nscathing letter from the\n\nPakistan High Commision\n\nto the United States\n\nAmbassador, as previously\n\n[made public in numerous](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1494033/abdul-basit-lambasted-envoy-us-aizaz-chaudhry-diplomatic-blunders/)\n\n[news](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/226834-Abdul-Basit-writes-scathing-letter-to-Aizaz-Chaudhry) [publications.](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/08/29/basit-points-out-pakistans-worst-diplomat-ever/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Details around travel in and around Pakistan from both**\n\nAustralian and German diplomats.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: Pictures from what appeared to be a weapons show included images of U.S. military hardware such as the United States Air Force Scene Mag.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6: Exfiltrated content was found to contain military photos including a series of images from an event with military attendees from numerous countries including U.S.**\n\nArmy personnel.\n\n**Figure 7: Many images of members belonging to the Afghan military were also discovered among the content taken from compromised devices.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Airport surveillance\n\nStealth Mango has collected data from a\n\nnumber of different locations. In particular\n\nwe discovered exfiltrated photos of passports\n\nand diplomatic IDs with GPS coordinates\n\nfrom the Kandahar airport in Afghanistan.\n\nThis indicates either someone is actively\n\nexfiltrating this data knowingly to the C2\n\nserver or that Stealth Mango has infected\n\nsomeone’s device that works at the airport\n\nunbeknownst to them.\n\n#### Victim analysis\n\n\n**Figure 8: EXIF GPS locations of exfiltrated photos of diplomatic IDs and passports from/near the**\n\nKandahar airport.\n\n\nThe attacker infrastructure had several operational security shortcomings that included the presence of a WSO web shell.\n\nThis allowed us to build out a comprehensive picture of this actor’s success, what they had been able to steal, and the groups\n\nthey were targeting. While the presence of this web shell allowed for the retrieval of usernames and passwords for databases\n\nand various services, we deemed the use of these credentials as falling outside the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).\n\nConsequently, we only retrieved and performed analysis on files that were publicly accessible and did not connect or log in to\n\nservices requiring authentication.\n\nWith these limitations in mind, we identified victims as likely being a mix of Pakistani government and military officials who had\n\naccess to sensitive material. Exfiltrated content also suggests a smaller subset of victims reside in India, Iraq, Afghanistan, and\n\nthe United Arab Emirates. We further identified content from other countries’ officials and diplomats, including the United States,\n\nAustralia, the United Kingdom, and Iran, however we believe this data may have been stolen when these individuals interacted\n\nwith Stealth Mango victims.\n\nMany of the images found on attacker servers did not contain latitude and longitude metadata however, for those that did we\n\nwere able to identify where some of the compromised images were taken.\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n**Figure 9: GPS coordinates pulled from the**\n\n\nEXIF data of exfiltrated images is centered\n\naround Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and the\n\nUnited Arab Emirates.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther analysis on the EXIF data of images provided some useful insights, including the identification of a surprising amount\n\nof iPhone metadata. While we haven’t found evidence of an iOS component installed on infected devices, we did discover\n\nthe existence of an iOS implant called Tangelo that was developed by these actors. This further backs up our theory that the\n\nattackers have multi-platform capabilities.\n\nIt’s possible that the images containing iOS metadata were sent from uninfected iPhones to compromised Android\n\ndevices and subsequently uploaded to attacker infrastructure. That said, the EXIF data pointed to a range of iOS devices\n\nand WHOIS information for this attacker that showed them registering domains such as iphonespyingsoftware[.]org,\n```\niphonespyingapps[.]org, and iphonespyingapps[.]info. This suggests the intention to create an iOS capability. \n\n```\nThe existence of Tangelo discovered on infrastructure owned by the developers further backs up our theories that there\n\nis an iOS component.\n\n###### Split of EXIF metadata found in stolen images\n\n Apple iPhone Haier 48.2% 0.7%\n\n Samsung Eurostar 26.9% 0.3%\n\n Motorola Huawei 12.5% 0.3%\n\n Lava Iris IVA 7.6% 0.2%\n\n LG Asus 1.1% 0.1%\n\n Nokia 2.0%\n\n**Figure 10: Analysis of the EXIF metadata contained in stolen images found that many contained information identifying the phone’s make and model on which they were**\n\ntaken. While this doesn’t definitely mean victims were using these makes and models, it is interesting to note that the majority are from iPhones.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Infection vectors\n\nAs we have seen by other threat actors in the past, the mechanism for infecting a device involves what we believe to be primarily\n\nphishing with the possibility of physical access. From examining the exfiltrated data, we have been able to pinpoint at least one of\n\nthe watering holes at secure-apps.azurewebsites[.]net. The watering hole, used to distribute the malware, pretends to be the\n\nthird-party Android app store APKMonk, but it is not. All links on the site to other apps will fail or re-direct to the Stealth Mango APK.\n\nThe information about the APK — including the package name, version info, and past versions — is all fake information created to get\n\nthe user to download the app.\n\nThe figure below shows what the watering hole looks like. The actors are using azurewebsites[.]net hosted by Microsoft to serve\n\nthe malicious page. We initiated a takedown with Microsoft on the watering hole. The actors complied with the removal request\n\nfrom Microsoft, but then uploaded a newer version of the malware. The account was ultimately suspended.\n\nThe watering hole URL could have been sent to targets in a phishing attack. In at least one case it was distributed via Facebook\n\nMessenger suggesting the attackers are using fake personas to connect with their targets and coerce them into installing the\n\nmalware onto their devices.\n\n**Figure 11: The watering hole as seen from desktop and mobile browsers.**\n\n\n-----\n\nphishing attempt via Facebook Messenger.\n\n\nWe also believe that physical access to some devices may have also been used as a\n\ninfection vector. When examining the exfiltrated data we came across a packing slip\n\nto a possible phone repair shop that contains the name of one of the people in the\n\nexfiltrated data.\n\n**Figure 13: A shipping slip used to send a cellphone to a possible repair shop. The sender of the phone**\n\nis a person in the exfiltrated data that communicated with a U.S. contact, possibly indicating malware was\n\ninstalled via physical access to the device.\n\n\n**Figure 12: A screenshot of an infected Android**\n\ndevice that shows the watering hole and the\n\n\n#### Stealth Mango functionality (Android)\n\nStealth Mango’s surveillance capabilities are spread out over a number of sub-packages within the application and are separated\n\ninto modules depending on the type of data they collect. The developer appears to be experienced in software development as\n\nabstraction of data models and other object-oriented techniques are used to develop structured communication with command\n\nand control infrastructure as well as database design.\n\nAll Stealth Mango samples launch their services at the highest priority possible and contain at least two background services which\n\ninitially upload all data from an infected device and then track all changes that occur as soon as they happen. The malware also has\n\ncategories for each type of information that, in later variants, is used as a model to create databases. These categories are also used\n\nto upload data into similarly named folders on command and control infrastructure. These are described below:\n\n\n\n- CR - Call Records\n\n- VD - Video\n\n\n\n- GL - Gallery\n\n- AU - Audio\n\n\n\n- SR - Surrounding recordings\n\n\n-----\n\nOn a device infected with Stealth Mango, the following data is uploaded and tracked:\n\n - Heartbeats to server infrastructure every 10 seconds.\n\n - Installed packages and device information.\n\n - Changes in SIM card or phone numbers on the device.\n\n - Picture, video and audio files stored on the device.\n\n - Calendar events and reminders.\n\n - Contact lists for various third-party applications such as Yahoo, AIM, GoogleTalk, ICQ, Jabber, MSN, NetMeeting, QQ, and Skype.\n\n - Call logs as well as recording incoming and outgoing calls. This includes blocking calls from phone numbers in a server\nprovided “block list” and then deleting them from the call logs of the user.\n\n - SMS logs and deleting incoming messages from server-specified numbers including those that contain particular strings.\n\n - Actor-specified commands received from text messages which are then promptly removed. These include commands\n\nto start/stop recording from the camera or microphone and take photos from the front and back camera.\n\n - GPS location tracking as well as capturing coordinates as soon as an SMS or call is received.\n\n - Functionality to detect when a victim is driving and has the ability to turn off internet and SMS reception during this time.\n\n**Figure 14: Stealth Mango attempts to access and exfiltrate the above databases of third-party social media applications if they are installed on the infected device.**\n\n\n-----\n\nLater versions of Stealth Mango contain heightened functionality to further track victims in real time including obtaining\n\nroot access to the device in order to ensure persistence as well as access the message databases of third-party social media\n\napplications. Stealth Mango creates multiple geo-fences which then monitors whenever the infected device crosses fence lines. It\n\nthen communicates these logs back to command and control infrastructure. In February 2018, Stealth Mango also extended key\n\nlogging, screenshot, and screen record functionality, which is also actor-controlled.\n\n**Figure 15: Stealth Mango uses the Accessibility Service to log keystrokes and insert them into a local database. This is stored along with the application package name which**\n\nwas in the foreground when the keystrokes were logged.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Tangelo functionality (iOS)\n\nThroughout the course of this investigation we have seen a large percentage of images in the exfil data that are from iOS devices\n\nwithout much more of an indication that there exists an iOS implant. However, from our investigation into more infrastructure\n\nbelieved to be owned and operated by the same developer, we encountered an iOS implant for jailbroken devices. The implant\n\ncomes in the form of a Debian package and was released in December 2016. The malware goes after private databases (only\n\naccessible on a jailbroken iOS device) from WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, and Line. Additionally, it contains functionality to get the\n\nfollowing data:\n\n                                                            - SMS messages\n\n                                                            - Call logs\n\n                                                            - Cellular IDs\n\n                                                            - Browser history\n\n                                                            - Pictures\n\n                                                            - Videos\n\n                                                            - GPS coordinates\n\n                                                            - Call recordings\n\n                                                            - Environmental recordings\n\n**Figure 16: Code from Tangelo that**\n\nreads SMS data.\n\nLike the Android implant, the iOS implant contains connections to TheOneSpy and MStealthAgent.\n\nAdditionally, we discovered that one of the IP addresses associated with the Tangelo implant was found in two apps in the iOS\n\nApp Store. We don’t have reason to suspect that these apps are malicious in nature at this time. The apps are from a company\n\ncalled MULTITEL LLC, which looks to have contracted the developers of Stealth Mango at some point to create their mobile\n\napps for both iOS and Android. However, one of the MULTITEL apps called MultiTEL, does send data to a server owned by the\n\ndeveloper where Tangelo was found.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Threat actor activity\n\nThroughout this investigation, Lookout researchers gained unique insight into the global operations of the actor deploying\n\nStealth Mango. This has primarily been possible due to the actor’s poor operational security, which allowed public access to data\n\nstolen from compromised devices. The presence of a web shell on the primary command and control server further increased this\n\nvisibility and caused scripts, configuration files, and additional exfiltrated content to be publicly exposed.\n\nIn analyzing this dataset, we identified what appears to be numerous test devices from the developers who we believe work for\n\nthe same freelance developer group. Audio recordings and content from these devices strongly suggest Stealth Mango is being\n\nactively demoed to prospective customers and that the developers behind it are succeeding in selling it. Not only have we been\n\nable to build out a picture of adversary behavior from this, but content from victim devices has helped us better understand why\n\nthe actor has chosen its specific targets.\n\n#### Associated Stealth Mango developers\n\nDuring our code analysis of Stealth Mango we found multiple similarities to other commodity spyware families that fall into the\n\ncategory of “spouseware,” or apps marketed as software that allow individuals to track and monitor the mobile devices of significant\n\nothers or their children. Research into the infrastructure behind these families has consistently linked back to several key individuals\n\nthat we have identified as belonging to the same freelance developer group associated with Stealth Mango and Tangelo.\n\n**Figure 17: The developer group advertises itself as having a physical presence in the United States, India, and Pakistan, and offers its services for only $50 USD an hour.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 18: Other individuals associated with Stealth Mango, also individually advertise their services on Freelancer.**\n\nAmong the data taken from test devices is personal information for an individual who we believe may be the main developer. This\n\ndata included referral letters for two separate software development companies called Vopium and Appstertech. We identified\n\nother developer identities in this exfiltrated data who may have also been previously employed at these companies, further\n\nconnecting these identities to Stealth Mango.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 19: A large amount of data was found on**\n\nattacker infrastructure that belonged to the main\n\ndeveloper. This included references from Vopium\n\nand Appstertech as well as identity cards and\n\npersonal photos.\n\nWe also observed the main developer using his email address to register domains associated with spyware families that\n\nshare many code similarities and heuristics with Stealth Mango. The most significant of these is TheOneSpy spyware from a\n\ncompany called Ox-i-Gen Inc. that we suspect the main developer may have worked on in some capacity. While Ox-i-Gen has its\n\nheadquarters in Sydney, Australia most of the connected employees on LinkedIn that work for Ox-i-Gen are located in Lahore,\n\nPakistan which along with the developer group connections may explain overlap between Stealth Mango and TheOneSpy.\n\nFurthermore, the main developer previously owned the domain mstealthagent[.]com, which we believe is an earlier iteration\n\nof Stealth Mango. This indicates he has been developing spyware tooling like Stealth Mango in official and unofficial capacities\n\nfor a few years.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 20: The main developer’s email address was previously used to register the domain mstealthagent[.]com for which spyware with code similar to Stealth Mango has**\n\nbeen identified.\n\nFrom the information available, our working theory is that the main developer is a full-time app developer primarily focused\n\non creating legitimate apps, but who is also moonlighting on the side. He is also part of a group of developers selling mobile\n\nsurveillanceware.\n\nFurther analysis of server side logs on attacker infrastructure showed three IPs that geolocate to a specific area of the G-8 area\n\nin Islamabad, Pakistan accessed the infrastructure. This is shown below, however at this point in time it is unclear whether this is\n\ninfrastructure being accessed by an administrator or some other actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 21: Geo-located IP**\n\nAddresses that were observed\n\nto have logged into the C2\n\nserver from the G-8 area in\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan.\n\n#### Infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure for Stealth Mango uses two IP address. The server itself (217.182.147[.]171) is hosted in France with a jump box to\n\nthat server located in Canada (158.69.159[.]57). However, as the campaign and actors are very active, we discovered the actor\n\ncreated several more malicious APKs that point to additional jump boxes, all of which resolve back to the main server:\n\n\n\n- `178.33.140[.]197`\n\n- `137.74.221[.]193`\n\n\n\n- `149.56.237[.]148`\n\n- `164.132.182[.]142`\n\n\n\n- `164.132.182[.]141`\n\n- `178.33.140[.]198`\n\n\n\n- `137.74.221[.]199`\n\n- `158.69.159[.]58`\n\n\n\n   - `137.74.147[.]190`\n\n   - `51.255.13[.]89`\n\nThe IPs map to servers\n\nhosted in the United\n\nKingdom, United States,\n\nGermany, Italy, Hong\n\nKong, and France.\n\n**Figure 22: Locations of the C2**\n\ninfrastructure for Stealth Mango.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 23: Mapping key pieces of attacker infrastructure and associated information.**\n\n\n-----\n\nLookout researchers believe the main server may have been compromised by a unknown third party as it was found to be running\n\nWSO shell. While WSO shell does require a user to authenticate themselves if they attempt to access the main user dashboard, it\n\nwas possible to login unauthenticated simply by browsing to a specific URL. Navigating to this URL provided complete access to\n\nthe WSO web shell and allows an operator to run various commands and browse server infrastructure as the www-data user. A\n\nuser can also use it to connect to local MySQL databases, execute arbitrary PHP scripts, run various file operations, retrieve server\n\ndetails, and run console commands.\n\n**Figure 24: A screenshot of the WSO shell found to be running on infrastructure used by Stealth Mango. This provides an actor with a considerable amount of control over the**\n\ncommand and control server. Much of the supporting PHP scripts are dated from 2015 and 2016 however exfil is very recent.\n\nWe also found the infrastructure hosting several APKs belonging to the Stealth Mango family which were only very recently\n\nadded. This indicates that not only is this operation still ongoing but that the tooling is being actively improved. We further\n\nconfirmed this via audio conversations from the developers that were captured when they were testing the malware on their\n\nown devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusions\n\n[Stealth Mango and Tangelo is yet another example among the numerous campaigns we have uncovered (Dark Caracal,](https://www.lookout.com/info/ds-dark-caracal-ty)\n\n[ViperRAT, FrozenCell, etc.) where threat actors are developing in-house custom surveillanceware. The actor behind](https://blog.lookout.com/viperrat-mobile-apt)\n\nStealth Mango has stolen a significant amount of sensitive data from compromised devices without the need to resort\n\nto exploits of any kind. The actors that are developing this surveillanceware are also setting up their own command and\n\ncontrol infrastructure and in some cases encountering some operational security missteps, enabling researchers to\n\ndiscover who the targets are and details about the actors operating it that otherwise are not as easily obtained. Relevant\n\ndata has already been shared with the appropriate authorities. Lookout customers are protected against Stealth Mango\n\nand Tangelo and have been for several months since the beginning of the investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix\n\n#### Indicators of Compromise\n\n##### Servers and IPs\n\n|Servers and IPs|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|158.69.159[.]57|jump box|\n|178.33.140[.]197|jump box|\n|137.74.221[.]193|jump box|\n|149.56.237[.]148|jump box|\n|164.132.182[.]142|jump box|\n|164.132.182[.]141|jump box|\n|178.33.140[.]198|jump box|\n|137.74.221[.]199|jump box|\n|158.69.159[.]58|jump box|\n|137.74.147[.]190|jump box|\n|51.255.13[.]89|jump box|\n\n|128.199.53[.]121|iOS related|\n|---|---|\n|178.238.226[.]34|iOS related|\n\n|217.182.147[.]171|main server|\n|---|---|\n\n|secure-apps.azurewebsites[.]net|watering hole|\n|---|---|\n|www.playstorepk[.]com|older watering hole|\n|facebook-snaps.azurewebsites[.]net|watering hole|\n|secure-google.azurewebsites[.]net|watering hole|\n|proworld.azurewebsites[.]net|watering hole|\n|secure-facebook.azurewebsites[.]net|watering hole|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### APK hashes\n\n|SHA1:|a910ad50e1fcf65f56f69b0efae1de6ff29e3998|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|SHA1:|133fa44cd54d6f684035145a3010a9eca4926d56||\n|SHA1:|d033425ade25c90ce00ca7503cb92300d91f9477||\n|SHA1:|37805ffbbed21128189c87dff5bd1f5c81c9b841||\n|SHA1:|0c64547cbb3b556f2d48902e80385a80895e7ae0||\n|SHA1:|8fb0b7fee1ce2a4a7bf935334ef07bcd741c7958||\n|SHA1:|408550f277b166e60328314619ca414e7acc8953||\n|SHA1:|2428061f9f46388f6d8fcebb40b5dd54701dd8cc||\n|SHA1:|edd25c64e34bef582cd4d209d8dfe2c25c085495||\n|SHA1:|7d1b14727aa529bbf9a3dbeba9cd881b91dff96c||\n|SHA1:|9f0ad56300e6d782325896479bd704761a5e3c45||\n|SHA1:|58d515e04ce02f47988068f3505bd2a9b85ea700||\n|SHA1:|73b54dc04b93449a137401da7e08bb35e2467e4a||\n|SHA1:|a59389656510a49fb8533e113d39300e032efb28||\n|SHA1:|ccba51dbd36d0586a32c458bcd769201975fa4d7||\n|SHA1:|4db9beb5c6e83a124993060fe1ea235413b93a68||\n|SHA1:|fd12615afc23ee780b21c825a8202e9b4768bca0||\n|SHA1:|ce41bc550998270b8d271abaef3261661ae64349||\n|SHA1:|2a78145905e5cd5a7b8085bcfae0ba11d032850a||\n|SHA1:|74987b1a3aa139348c179e86364abee1b4f9dadc|different IP jump box|\n|SHA1:|07bfeb6cf511e3110ae7ac92c39ff4732bd74619|different IP jump box|\n|SHA1:|dd3629e11943948d77679971564a12032e1c2c99|different IP jump box|\n|SHA1:|2b3dced1712c838c283137baa132871280b10e97|different IP jump box|\n|SHA1:|5e54a85d8baaa24a8ee644fd397ba4301f7e0152|different IP jump box|\n|SHA1:|3f87a6e09a7c095ecf192aa8932500795ae4201c|different IP jump box|\n|SHA1:|166449cdc909ce303ba4bd2f8a154c6a23bf5915|different IP jump box|\n|SHA1:|9bfedcbd7968e0e56d9d16e42f0e46115ece1bc5|different IP jump box|\n|SHA1:|a31f3b7fb1cb5c3bef967a599e0cbe7d4fcc26b8||\n|SHA1:|815900850aa1bb1ab7f383e88bf81e6a4be41fb7||\n|SHA1:|ff321433e88986f0cb6782be640e11edf7d4fb03||\n|SHA1:|faa6223fe6c58d24a5c099239b8bc2ea40d99fdb||\n|SHA1:|d51556a13a5e781a3c23fd91e0858e31e056c214||\n\n\n-----\n\n|SHA1:|89e3bf4b097acadbc89fc39ca9daac6f5c574e00|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|SHA1:|2369b8407ca0e2c30ab66ca74895ea3c0a157ec7||\n|SHA1:|5992bf8d560b75b44bade3997bf4c6470f798e31||\n|SHA1:|0736bf049415cc0804ce54538d28db2206e52b90||\n|SHA1:|9f8c3af2d4a8ad19852108b0f46c68504adb8245||\n|SHA1:|a57b6f262ed0a9b3d3cb5338cb968593c490b6e3||\n\n\n##### APK package names and app names\n```\n Package Name: com.gbooking.googleupdater\n Package Name: com.update.system\n Package Name: com.itelephone.dialer\n Package Name: com.due.gplayer\n Package Name: com.maps.lgmaps\n Package Name: com.booking.gvoice\n Package Name: com.gsync\n Package Name: com.play.pservies\n Package Name: com.lgoogle.playupdate\n Package Name: com.gsearch.ichrome\n\n iOS hashes\n SHA1: 12611891024aee97fe5d811e8114e282e86876ea\n SHA1: 221a884f6f9c8428033123861d95aa7e7445c40a\n SHA1: 921d6e701a39f2a70eea2c94cf4ba21d61c2ceb5\n\n iOS Bundle ID\n\n```\n`Bundle ID:` com.mobilekare.notifierrrr\n\n##### Miscellaneous\n\n|Package Name:|com.gbooking.googleupdater|App Name:|GoogleUpdater|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Package Name:|com.update.system|App Name:|System|\n|Package Name:|com.itelephone.dialer|App Name:|Dialer|\n|Package Name:|com.due.gplayer|App Name:|GPlayer|\n|Package Name:|com.maps.lgmaps|App Name:|gmaps|\n|Package Name:|com.booking.gvoice|App Name:|GVoice|\n|Package Name:|com.gsync|App Name:|Gsync|\n|Package Name:|com.play.pservies|App Name:|Pservies|\n|Package Name:|com.lgoogle.playupdate|App Name:|Playupdater|\n|Package Name:|com.gsearch.ichrome|App Name:|iChrome|\n\n|iOS hashes|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|SHA1:|12611891024aee97fe5d811e8114e282e86876ea|Debian package|\n|SHA1:|221a884f6f9c8428033123861d95aa7e7445c40a|Mach-O binary|\n|SHA1:|921d6e701a39f2a70eea2c94cf4ba21d61c2ceb5|Mach-O binary|\n\n|Bundle ID:|com.mobilekare.notifierrrr|\n|---|---|\n\n|iOS Team ID:|GUDCEEC5K9|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### About Lookout\n\nLookout is a cybersecurity company for a world run by apps.\n\nPowered by the largest dataset of mobile code in existence,\n\nLookout is the security platform of record for mobile device\n\nintegrity and data access.
