    "plain_text": "# Nightmare week for security vendors: Now a Trend Micro bug is being exploited in the wild\n\n**[therecord.media/nightmare-week-for-security-vendors-now-a-trend-micro-bug-is-being-exploited-in-the-wild/](https://therecord.media/nightmare-week-for-security-vendors-now-a-trend-micro-bug-is-being-exploited-in-the-wild/)**\n\nApril 22, 2021\n\nUS-Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro disclosed on Wednesday that a threat actor\nbegan using a bug in its antivirus products to gain admin rights on Windows systems as part\nof its attacks.\n\nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-24557, affects the company’s Apex\nOne and [OfficeScan XG, two advanced security products aimed at enterprise customers.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint.html)\n\n[The bug was discovered last year by Christopher Vella, a vulnerability researcher at](https://twitter.com/Kharosx0)\nMicrosoft, who privately reported the issue to Trend Micro through the company’s Zero-Day\nInitiative bug acquisition program.\n\n[Trend Micro patched the issue in August 2020, but in an update to its](https://appweb.trendmicro.com/SupportNews/NewsDetail.aspx?id=4126) initial security\nadvisory posted on Wednesday, the security firm said it learned of incidents where this same\nbug was weaponized to attack some of its customers.\n\n“The specific flaw exists within the logic that controls access to the Misc folder,” the ZDI team\nsaid last year. “An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute\ncode in the context of SYSTEM.”\n\nBased on this description of the issue, the bug could not be used to break into systems but\nwas used as a second step in a multi-phase exploit chain after hackers already planted\nmalicious code on a victim’s computer and used the bug to take full control of an infected\nsystem.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Trend Micro did not share any details about the attackers, a source familiar with the\nattacks told The Record the bug was used by an advanced persistent threat (APT), a term\nusually used to refer to state-sponsored cyber-espionage groups.\n\nThis bug now becomes the fourth vulnerability in Apex One and OfficeScan XG security\n[products that has been exploited in the wild after CVE-2019-18187,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/trend-micro-antivirus-zero-day-used-in-mitsubishi-electric-hack/) CVE-2020-8467, and\nCVE-2020-8468.\n\nThe first three were abused in 2019 and 2020, with the first being used by a Chinese cyberespionage group during an attack on Mitsubishi Electric.\n\n## A bad week for security product vendors\n\nNews about hackers exploiting the Trend Micro vulnerability comes a day after FireEye\ndisclosed that multiple hacking groups had also exploited zero-day in security products\nfrom [Pulse Secure and](https://therecord.media/chinese-hackers-use-new-pulse-secure-vpn-zero-day-to-breach-us-defense-contractors/) [SonicWall.](https://therecord.media/hackers-go-after-sonicwall-email-appliances-with-three-zero-days/)\n\nWhile all these attacks are unrelated, they show a pattern in real-world attacks where threat\nactors are slowly realizing that security products are as vulnerable as any other software,\nand, because of the central and privileged position they occupy inside most corporate\nnetworks, they are ideal entry points into high-profile targets.\n\nTags\n\n[antivirus](https://therecord.media/tag/antivirus/)\n[exploit](https://therecord.media/tag/exploit/)\n[Office](https://therecord.media/tag/office/)\n[security software](https://therecord.media/tag/security-software/)\n[Trend Micro](https://therecord.media/tag/trend-micro/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record. He previously worked at ZDNet\nand Bleeping Computer, where he became a well-known name in the industry for his\nconstant scoops on new vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and law enforcement actions against\nhackers.\n\n\n-----",
