    "plain_text": "# Infrastructure Research and Hunting: Boiling the Domain Ocean\n\n**threatconnect.com/blog/infrastructure-research-hunting/**\n\nDecember 15, 2020\n\nThe Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis identifies two main nodes as actor assets that may\nultimately interact with a target / victim’s own assets — capabilities and infrastructure. But\nwhile “exploitation” is usually considered something the adversary does, it works both ways\nas threat intelligence researchers and defenders in general can exploit the discoverable\ncharacteristics and tactics those adversaries employ with either node.\n\nIn this blog, we’re going to explore important considerations and methodologies for exploiting\nactors’ infrastructure tactics. Ultimately, our hope is to teach defenders how they can\nproactively find, address, and defend against their adversaries’ procured infrastructure.\nAlong the way, we’ll provide examples of infrastructure research to serve as demonstrations\nof the concepts at play.\n\nWe’re going to focus on adversaries’ use of procured domains with this blog. In other words,\nmost aspects of the workflows we describe herein usually will not be applicable to\nresearching compromised infrastructure. From a procurement perspective, adversaries may\ntake one or more of the following general steps to set up their infrastructure BEFORE it is\nused in operations:\n\nCreate a registration persona\nBuy a domain name from a registrar/reseller\nSet up hosting at an IP address\nSet up target or operation-specific subdomain infrastructure\nCreate an SSL certificate if requiring HTTPS communication\nEnable services at a hosting IP address or the domain\nSet up domain with a website or redirect\n\n“Before” is the opportune word in the last sentence. Each one of those steps can leave\nbehind a trace of the tactics that an actor used in conjunction with their procured\ninfrastructure. In [recent blogs, DomainTools described the inherent idea here that](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/extrapolating-adversary-intent-through-infrastructure)\n[infrastructure indicators should be considered composite objects made of atomic parts that](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects)\ncan be studied to extract adversary tactics. As defenders, if we can identify, research, and\nhunt for those characteristics and tactics, we can potentially identify our adversaries’\ninfrastructure before it is used in operations against us. Ultimately, those steps manifest\ncharacteristics and tactics in one or more of the primary “dimensions” of infrastructure that\nwe investigate:\n\nRegistration (WHOIS)\n\n\n-----\n\nHosting\nSubdomains\nCertificate use\nIP Configuration\nContent (HTML)\n\nIt’s important to note up front that we’re not just going to be looking for tactics that are\nexclusively unique to our adversaries. In some cases the tactics, or confluence of\ncharacteristics, that we hunt for may not yield adversary-specific results but rather a smaller\nset of infrastructure against which additional analysis may identify our adversaries’ domains.\nAll that is to say, even non-unique tactics can be exploited for viable hunting grounds if not\nused excessively.\n\n_Definitions_\n\nThe terms “infrastructure research” and “infrastructure hunting” may be considered\nsynonymous and used interchangeably to describe defenders’ exploitation of adversaries’\ninfrastructure characteristics (individual elements in a dimension) and tactics (combinations\nof characteristics). For the purposes of this blog, we will explicitly define each.\n\n**Infrastructure research refers to the retroactive efforts taken to understand the**\ncharacteristics and tactics behind an adversary’s identified infrastructure and building out an\nunderstanding of the adversary’s current and past infrastructure based on those findings.\n\n**Infrastructure hunting refers to the proactive application of infrastructure research, where**\nadversaries’ known characteristics and tactics are exploited to identify their new\ninfrastructure. There is a symbiotic relationship between the two, where output from each\nimpacts the other.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Tools_\n\nThere are a number of tools that enable defenders to exploit adversaries’ infrastructure\ntactics, in many cases overlapping with other capabilities. Each of the tools has its own\nstrengths with respect to researching or hunting for adversary infrastructure, and in many\ncases using multiple in conjunction may be necessary to ultimately exploit adversary tactics.\nOn the ThreatConnect Research team, we have found success using the following for\nresearch and/or hunting:\n\nDomainTools Iris\nPassiveTotal\nFarsight DNSDB and Scout\n\n\n-----\n\nurlscan.io\nCensys\nShodan\nGreyNoise\n\n_Relationship to the Capabilities Node / Malware Hunting_\n\nWe would be remiss if we didn’t at least mention that there is also a symbiotic relationship\nbetween the output from our infrastructure research and hunting efforts and the capabilities\nnode of the diamond model. Malware analysis efforts can identify infrastructure in behavioral\ninformation that feeds infrastructure research for a given actor/activity. Conversely, output\nfrom our infrastructure hunting efforts can be compared against sandbox reports, used as\nfodder for malware hunting by way of YARA rules searching for the output, or scanning of\nidentified infrastructure for hosted malicious files.\n\n**_Infrastructure Research_**\n\nIn this section we’ll describe, at a higher level, our workflows for infrastructure research and\nhunting when investigating infrastructure associated with an actor or activity.\n\n_Singular Characteristics_\n\nWhen starting an investigation into a given domain or set of domains, we generally follow the\nbelow workflow, and start by looking for single, unique characteristics. Please note that the\nbelow list is not exhaustive but is generally those that we’ve encountered regularly. (Side\nnote: Determining whether a characteristic is “unique” generally requires that we perform\nadditional research in one of the aforementioned tools to see how widely used that given\ncharacteristic is. Whenever there is uncertainty as to whether a given characteristic is\nunique, that should be considered in the analysis attributing a new domain to an\nactor/activity.)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis really represents the base use case for infrastructure research — think back to using\none adversary’s registrant email address to find the other domains they created. But as\nWHOIS privacy protection, GDPR masking, and anonymous identity resellers (eg. Njalla)\nhave become more prevalent over the last 2+ years, unique registration pivots have become\nharder to come by. The other dimensions as unique pivot points have therefore become\nmore important and pertinent to investigations.\n\nThere is also an iterative component to this research as well — additional infrastructure\nidentified from the characteristics of one dimension, may lead to new unique characteristics\nin the other dimensions.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe findings from this initial workflow focused on singular, unique characteristics can be\nimmediately operationalized for infrastructure hunting, where new domains are monitored for\nthe given characteristics and associated with the related actor/activity. However, there are\nimportant considerations longer term, specifically for IP addresses, subdomain and certificate\nstrings, or content. For these dimensions, while the given characteristic may be unique now,\nthat could change in the future as IP addresses are reallocated or strings are co-opted for\nuse by other actors. All that is to say that it’s important to know where unique characteristics\ntoday might not be unique tomorrow.\n\nFor notable singular characteristics that are not unique, but not widely used, such as the use\nof a small CIDR block to host domains, hunting can be geared around those characteristics\nto generate hunting ground against which additional analysis will yield the relevant\ninfrastructure. Or those characteristics can be taken in conjunction with others, as described\nin In the Land of Registration Protection, Characteristic Confluence Reigns.\n\nExamples of previous research based on unique characteristics:\n\nDedicated servers, Subdomain strings: Kimsuky Phishing Operations Putting in Work\n(9/28/20)\n[SSL certificate, Dedicated servers: Lights, Camera, Actionable Intelligence (3/18/19)](https://threatconnect.com/blog/entertainment-industry-spoofed-domains/)\n[Certificate strings: A Song of Intel and Fancy (3/16/18)](https://threatconnect.com/blog/using-fancy-bear-ssl-certificate-information-to-identify-their-infrastructure/)\n[Email address: Duping Doping Domains (1/11/18)](https://threatconnect.com/blog/duping-doping-domains/)\n[SSL certificate, Splash pages: Track to the Future (9/21/17)](https://threatconnect.com/blog/track-to-the-future/)\n[Dedicated servers, Email address: Let’s Get Fancy (10/18/16)](https://threatconnect.com/blog/how-to-investigate-incidents-in-threatconnect/)\n\n_In the Land of Registration Protection, Characteristic Confluence Reigns_\n\nAfter exhausting our research into individual characteristics we’ll then move to investigate\ncombinations of non-unique characteristics. It is in this workflow that we’ve found the most\ninvestigative success since the advent of privacy and GDPR protection. The idea with this\nworkflow is to identify as many different combinations of two or more non-unique\ninfrastructure characteristics within or between the dimensions that, when taken in\nconjunction, potentially identify unique tactics or tactics that are not widely used.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe characteristics shown above are those that we tend to review in conjunction with other\ncharacteristics to identify tactics within and among those dimensions. It should be noted\nexplicitly that for the Registration, Certificate Use, and IP Configuration dimensions, tactics\ncan be identified from entirely within that dimension also. As an example, an adversary may\nconsistently register their domains using the same email domain and boutique name servers.\n\nDuring this workflow, we are constantly checking and making note of how widely the given\nconfluence of characteristics — or tactic — is present in infrastructure beyond that which\nwe’re investigating. Ultimately, like with the previous workflow, we’re looking to identify tactics\n\n\n-----\n\nthat are either 1) unique to the infrastructure we re investigating or 2) not widely used\n**beyond the infrastructure we’re investigating. Keep those two in mind as we explore**\nconsiderations in the Infrastructure Hunting section.\n\nIt’s important to note that this research workflow is much less structured and instead is\nassisted by the researcher’s knowledge of commonalities in both the infrastructure\ndimensions and actor/activity. As an example, knowing that specific ASNs are widely used in\nconjunction with domains registered through a specific registrar can help narrow down the\ncharacteristics of the given infrastructure that actually merit focus. Further, if a threat group is\nknown to have used boutique email domains and reused resellers for procurement, those are\ncharacteristics this workflow can focus on. The more familiarity the researcher has with the\ngiven dimensions and researched actor/activity in general, the quicker they’ll be able to spot\nthe characteristics that merit consideration as part of a tactic.\n\nExamples of previous research based on tactics:\n\nDomain Strings, Name server, SSL Certificates, CIDR Block: 20201019A: Additional\nRyuk Infrastructure (10/19/20)\nCreation Timestamp and Name server: Building Out ProtonMail Spoofed Infrastructure\n(7/26/19)\nCreation Date and Name server: 20200529A: Network of Probable Sandworm\nInfrastructure (5/29/20)\nDomain Strings, Email domain, Name server, SSL Certificates, Content: Domains\nSpoofing Ukrainian Gas and Media Companies (12/16/19)\n\n**_Infrastructure Hunting_**\n\nFollowing our research efforts, we can operationalize our findings by way of infrastructure\nhunting. We typically use the aforementioned tools to create and run the signatures / rules\nthat are based on our research findings. When possible, we automate the execution and\noutput ingestion of these rules in ThreatConnect to alert on new results, memorialize them,\n[and kick off additional analysis. Check out a recent webinar we did with DomainTools for a](https://threatconnect.com/resource/proactive-infrastructure-hunting-with-threatconnect-domaintools/)\nspecific example. This section captures infrastructure hunting considerations at a high level.\n\n_Effective Signatures_\n\nIf we consider the body of domains that exist, with hundreds of thousands registered every\nday, it is a metaphorical ocean. With infrastructure hunting, our goal is to build a strong\nenough fire with the research-derived rules to boil that ocean down to a smaller body of\nwater with domains that are specific to our threats or against which minimal additional\nanalysis can identify their domains. Consider the below graphic to illustrate this concept\nbehind infrastructure hunting and striving to generate effective rules.\n\n\n-----\n\nThinking back to the Infrastructure Research section, we mentioned that we were looking to\nidentify characteristics and tactics that were 1) unique to the infrastructure we’re\n**investigating or 2) not widely used beyond the infrastructure we’re investigating. The**\nreason being is that either could be used to craft effective infrastructure hunting rules. Sure,\nthe best case scenario is having signatures that exploit threat-specific characteristics and\nboil The Domain Ocean down to a Threat Puddle where we have high confidence that the\nresulting domains are associated with the threat we’re concerned about.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, rules that result in the Hunting Ground Lake and a small number of domains that\nboth are and aren’t associated with our threats still are valuable to analysts looking to\nproactively identify relevant infrastructure. With these results, we initially have less\nconfidence in their association to the threat and have to conduct additional analysis against\nthe output infrastructure to determine whether we can make the analytic judgement that an\noutput domain is associated with the hunted threat.\n\nHow much tolerance a researcher or organization has in conducting that additional analysis\nagainst the hunting ground domains will vary. To that end, how specific those hunting rules\nresulting in this output need to be will vary accordingly. For example, one analyst hunting for\na given threat might be able to tolerate conducting additional analysis against 50 domains a\nday to better identify their threat’s specific domains, whereas another may be willing to\ntolerate 100. To that end, the size of the Hunting Ground Lake will vary for both and the latter\nanalyst can craft less specific signatures to cast a wider net for their threat’s domains.\n\nWhat we want to avoid is rules that land us in Inefficient Sea (inefficiency, get it?) where\nthere is little-to-no confidence that the excessive output domains are associated with our\nthreats, and against which additional analysis would be too cumbersome to ultimately identify\nrelevant domains.\n\n_Additional Analysis and “Suspicious” Domains_\n\nFurther analysis against domains from hunting ground rules seeks to determine additional\nconsistencies with an actor’s previous operations. Processing the output could involve\nmanual review of the domains for things that you couldn’t include in the signature (think back\nto the other dimensions mentioned above), use of additional tools to identify other traces of\nactivity or tactics employed, or building out an understanding of that domain’s associated\ninfrastructure for other actor consistencies. How much, if anything, you can identify while\nfurther analyzing infrastructure in the hunting ground is ultimately going to impact the\nconfidence with which you can assess that an output domain is associated with an actor.\n\nDespite our best efforts to enrich and further analyze domains from our hunting grounds, in\nmany cases we may not find any additional context to help us determine whether an output\ndomain is associated with a given threat. In these instances, we tend to label this\ninfrastructure as “suspicious” given that it has non-unique consistencies with our threat’s\nidentified infrastructure tactics. We can still take defensive measures against these\nsuspicious domains, and can develop longer term analytic processes (monitor DNS changes,\nregular content scans, YARA rules to hunt for files with relevant behavioral information) to\nmonitor for new context and update our understanding of the infrastructure.\n\n_Multiple Signatures for Wider Coverage_\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the course of your research, you may generate multiple rules exploiting various\ncharacteristics or tactics identified in a set of adversary/activity infrastructure. This is perfect\nand a great way to ensure that you’ll still identify a threat’s domains if they reuse one tactic\nbut not another. We would caution against creating one signature to rule them all and exploit\nthe various identified tactics as it becomes more difficult to understand what specific tactic\nresulted in an output domain. What can be useful is grouping related tactics (those exploiting\nthe same characteristics in the same dimensions) together.\n\nFor example, if you identify that your threat has used Protonmail and Tutanota email\naddresses to register domains hosted in two ASNs, having a single rule to capture domains\nregistered using either one of those two email domains AND either one of those two ASNs\nmitigates the need to create four separate rules for the related tactics.\n\n**_Proactive Infrastructure Hunting and Defense Considerations_**\n\nInfrastructure research and hunting efforts ideally move organizations toward a proactive\nstance with respect to their identified adversaries where defensive action is taken against\nthose adversaries’ infrastructure before it is operationalized against the organization.\nHowever, these efforts are not without additional considerations.\n\n_Defensive Action vs. Research_\n\nIt’s important to note that defensive action considerations for output from infrastructure\nhunting may differ in scope and tolerance from those heretofore described for research and\nanalysis. For example, an organization may want to automatically block or monitor for every\ndomain from a hunting rule that lands you in Hunting Ground Lake. The idea being that even\nthose output domains from the given rule that aren’t associated with the hunted threat still\nhave no legitimate utility for a business, so taking proactive defensive measures against all\nwould mitigate the time and work going into additional research against those domains to\nidentify the threat-specific results.\n\nAs an example, if you identify that one of your threats regularly registers domains through a\nboutique reseller (as reflected in the name server) that only creates a couple dozen domains\na day, automating defensive action against all those domains could be a viable, proactive\nmeasure, even if they aren’t all related to the given threat.\n\n_Sacrificing Context for Proactivity_\n\nA notable aspect of leveraging infrastructure hunting output is that we generally have to\nsacrifice context for proactivity. However, we’d argue that is a sacrifice most organizations\nshould be willing to make, especially for their most pertinent threats. Taking a “wait and see”\napproach to garner more information on the domains that your specific infrastructure hunting\nsignatures yield invariably subjects an organization to unnecessary risk from those domains.\nConsider the below graph showing the inverse relationship between proactivity and\nadversary operationalization\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen a domain is initially registered, that is when an organization has the best opportunity to\naddress that domain before the actor has a chance to use it against their organization. Over\ntime, the chances that the adversary will have used the domain increase while the\nopportunity to proactively address it decrease accordingly. The better you can decrease the\ndelta between when a potential adversary domain is registered and your defensive action is\ntaken, the better, even if it’s at the detriment of context.\n\n_Thanks From the Future_\n\nAnother important consideration related to proactivity is that the new infrastructure that you\ndiscover from hunting rules and build out now might not be relevant until some time in the\nfuture. Said another way, a lack of actual current activity associated with the domains you\nresearched doesn’t mean that your research was done in vain. A suspicious domain today\ncould be the command and control (C2) domain used in conjunction with your adversary’s\nnew malware tomorrow. When that’s the case, having already built out an understanding of\nthe suspicious domain and other associated infrastructure associated with it enables more\nthorough defensive actions from your future self.\n\n**_Potential Pitfalls_**\n\nInfrastructure research and hunting processes generally are not infallible and it’s important to\nunderstand the common pitfalls to avoid during the course of your investigations.\n\n_Temporal Volatility of Hunting Signatures_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs noted above, there is a temporal aspect to the uniqueness of many characteristics or\ntactics identified during the course of infrastructure research. Over time, by chance or\nintention, more malicious and benign actors may use characteristics and tactics that were\nonce specific to the threats that you researched. Email addresses can be dropped and\nreused by others in the future; other individuals may coincidentally register domains that\nmimic a threat’s registration consistencies. To that end, it’s important to understand how the\nuniqueness of those characteristics degrade over time, how easy they are to mimic, and how\nthose concerns ultimately affect confidence levels in attributing domains to the hunted\nthreats.\n\n_Susceptibility to Co-opting / False Flags_\n\nThere are other concerns regarding the volatility of infrastructure hunting rules, notably that\nother adversaries can co-opt known tactics to give the perception that the activity they are\nconducting is associated with another threat. One recent example of this was identified in an\n[August 2020 Kaspersky report on DeathStalker where the actor had used an SSL certificate](https://securelist.com/deathstalker-mercenary-triumvirate/98177/)\nsubject string consistent with previously identified Fancy Bear infrastructure. In addition to\nthe aforementioned notes regarding volatility affecting confidence levels, this is an aspect of\ninfrastructure hunting that multiple rules, thorough knowledge of the adversary’s previous\ninfrastructure, and capability node centric analysis can help avoid. As an example, if a\ndomain hits on a hunting rule that has previously been specific to your adversary, but doesn’t\ncarry any of the other characteristics previously seen with that adversary or the output\ndomains from that rule, then that should ultimately affect your confidence level in and\nlanguage associating the domain with the adversary.\n\n_Erroneous / Excessive Pivoting_\n\nFinally, the biggest pitfall that someone can run into when getting into infrastructure research\nand hunting is erroneous pivoting — using a non-unique characteristic as though it is a\nunique characteristic. Most often, this manifests in pivots based on hosting IPs where the\nresearcher mistakenly believes that all domains at a given IP are associated with the domain\nthey are investigating. Sometimes these IPs can be parking lots, sinkholes, or non-dedicated\ninfrastructure that isn’t widely used but seems exceedingly suspicious and therefore all\nrelated. The same can happen for other characteristics as well, so it is important to\nthoroughly consider all the characteristics upon which you’re building out adversary\ninfrastructure. Always investigate the uniqueness of those characteristics and ensure that\nany uncertainty is reflected in the confidence levels in your analysis.\n\n**_Conclusion_**\n\nThis blog post was intended to provide a higher level overview of how we go about\ninfrastructure research and hunting, specifically as it relates to procured domains. There are\nso many investigative avenues in those dimensions that we mentioned (and almost certainly\n\n\n-----\n\nothers) that can help you build out an understanding of your adversaries infrastructure and\nproactively hunt for and defend against them.\n\nIf you’re looking for more specifics on how we’ve employed these processes before, consider\nchecking out some of the blogs previously referenced or logging into ThreatConnect to see\nthe recent research we’ve shared.\n\n\n-----",
