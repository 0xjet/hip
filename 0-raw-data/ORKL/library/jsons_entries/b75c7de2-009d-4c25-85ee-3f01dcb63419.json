We are preparing a follow-up report, but we\nbelieve it is important to note that there is now evidence that the Nile Phish operator has engaged in phishing of 2-factor authentication\ncodes.See: Evidence of 2 Factor Phishing\n\n### Key Findings\n\nEgyptian NGOs are currently being targeted by Nile Phish, a large-scale phishing campaign.\n\nAlmost all of the targets we identified are also implicated in Case 173, a sprawling legal case brought by the Egyptian government\nagainst NGOs, at ich has been referred to as an “unprecedented crackdown” on Egypt’s civil society.\n\nNile Phish operators demonstrate an intimate knowledge of Egyptian NGOs, and are able to roll out phishing attacks within hours of\ngovernment actions, such as arrests.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis report describes Nile Phish, an ongoing and extensive phishing campaign against Egyptian civil society. In recent years, Egypt has\n[witnessed what is widely described as an “unprecedented crackdown,” on both civil society and dissent. Amidst this backdrop, in late](http://www.france24.com/en/20170113-egypt-crackdown-civil-society-ngo-amnesty-sisi)\n[November 2016 Citizen Lab began investigating phishing attempts on staff at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), an Egyptian](http://eipr.org/en)\norganization working on research, advocacy and legal engagement to support basic freedoms and rights.\n\nWith the collaboration and assistance of EIPR, our investigation expanded to include seven Egyptian NGOs targeted by Nile Phish. These\nseven organizations work on a variety of human rights issues, including political freedoms, gender issues, and freedom of speech. We also\nidentified individual targets, including Egyptian lawyers, journalists, and independent activists.\n\nWith only a handful of exceptions, Nile Phish targets are implicated in [Case 173, a legal case brought against NGOs by the Egyptian](http://eipr.org/en/press/2016/03/background-case-no-173-%E2%80%9Cforeign-funding-case%E2%80%9D)\ngovernment over issues of foreign funding. The phishing campaign also coincides with renewed pressure on these organizations and their\nstaff by the Egyptian government, in the context of Case 173, including asset freezes, travel bans, forced closures, and arrests.\n\nOur collaborative investigation has documented at least 92 messages sent by Nile Phish, many highly personalized, and sent as recently as\nJanuary 31st, 2017. The phishing campaign has included at least two phases, each with distinct phishing tactics and domains. Efforts seem to\nhave been made to compartmentalize the infrastructure for each phase, but a technical error allowed us to link the servers and conclude that\nthe two phases were part of a single campaign.\n\nNile Phish’s sponsor clearly has a strong interest in the activities of Egyptian NGOs, specifically those charged by the Egyptian government in\nCase 173. The Nile Phish operator shows intimate familiarity with the targeted NGOs activities, the concerns of their staff, and an ability to\nquickly phish on the heels of action by the Egyptian government. For example, we observed phishing against the colleagues of prominent\n[Egyptian lawyer Azza Soliman, within hours of her arrest in December 2016. The phishing claimed to be a copy of her arrest warrant.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/womens-rights-activist-azza-soliman-arrested-in-egypt)\n\nWe are not in a position in this report to conclusively attribute Nile Phish to a particular sponsor. However, the scale of the campaign and its\npersistence, within the context of other legal pressures and harassment, compound the extremely difficult situation faced by NGOs in Egypt.\n\n\n-----\n\ny p g y p\nrising tide of official and semi-official allegations of foreign interference and foreign funding against Egypt’s civil society organizations.\n\n[In 2011, the Egyptian Government embarked on a wide-ranging legal case charging that many civil society organizations receive foreign](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/12/close-case-173/)\n[funding, and may be engaged in prohibited or illegal activities. The case is widely viewed as politically-motivated, and an attempt to frustrate](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/12/close-case-173/)\nand block the ability of Egyptian civil society to continue its pro-democracy and human rights monitoring work.\n\nAs part of Case 173, international organizations (e.g.,the National Democratic Institute) and domestic groups (e.g. the Egyptian Initiative for\nPersonal Rights) have been subjected to a wide range of legal sanctions, including arrests, travel bans, asset freezes and harsh sentencing.\nIn 2013, 43 defendants working for international NGOs were sentenced to prison for their work, many in absentia as they had already left the\ncountry.\n\nNow more than 5 years old, Case 173 has been marked by periods of calm, and of intense activity. Initially primarily focused on international\nNGOs like the National Democratic Institute and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the case has grown increasingly focused on domestic\n[Egyptian organizations. The 37 organizations known to be accused in the case include respected civil liberties groups, pro-bono law firms,](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/20/egypt-ruling-risks-eradicating-human-rights-work)\nand organizations working on gender issues. More recently, beginning in Spring 2016, travel bans and asset freezes were placed on staff\nmembers of some domestic organizations under investigation.\n\nAs a result, many who work for NGOs named in the case are concerned that their ability to travel may be restricted, and that they may face\narrest, jail time or other forms of punishment. Nile Phish, the campaign described in this report, not only targets these individuals, but uses\ndeceptions that play directly into these fears and concerns.\n\n### The Nile Phish Campaign\n\nIn late 2016, Citizen Lab was contacted by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), whose technical team had observed a growing\nnumber of suspicious emails sent to EIPR accounts. The messages had caught the attention of the technical team because multiple\nmessages arrived at the same time, concerned current events, and seemed to play on emotional themes related to Case 173. EIPR’s team\nhelped broaden the investigation to a total of seven targeted Egyptian NGOs.\n\nAll of the seven Egyptian organizations are also implicated by Case 173. The targets include reputable and respected organizations working\non political and rights issues such as freedom of expression, gender rights, and victims of torture and forced disappearances. Six of the\norganizations have agreed to be named in this report and one requested to be referenced anonymously (see Table 1).\n\n**Table 1: Egyptian NGOs Known to be Targeted by Nile Phish**\n\n**Targeted NGO** **What they do**\n\n**[Association for Freedom of](http://afteegypt.org/?lang=en)** Legal aid, strategic litigation, and awareness-raising on issues of freedom of expression in Egypt.\n**Thought and Expression (AFTE)**\n\n**[Cairo Institute for Human Rights](http://www.cihrs.org/?lang=en)** A regional NGO that promotes respect for human rights and democracy in the Arab Region.\n**Studies (CIHRS)**\n\n**Egyptian Commission for Rights** Egyptian organization defending human rights and tracking violations.

The recipient was invited to visit a link to read\nmore about the panel.\n\n[The operators used language from a real NGO statement that had been circulating, embellishing it with the fake meeting. According to the](http://eipr.org/en/press/2016/11/political-parties-and-civil-society-organizations-reject-new-associations-law)\ncarefully crafted fiction, the event was co-sponsored by several other NGOs, including EIPR, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies\n(CIHRS) and Nazra for Feminist Studies (Nazra). These NGOs were signatories of the legitimate statement. Interestingly Nadeem, EIPR,\nCIHRS, and Nazra were all later targeted by the same phishing campaign.\n\n**Nov 24 Message Excerpt (Translated)“…The state has already taken real steps to eliminate Egyptian civil society organizations by**\nprosecuting case no. 173/2011 on foreign funding, and several organizations and their current and former directors have been banned from\ntravel and have had their assets frozen. This new law, however, would pave the way for the eradication of any sort of civic action geared to\ndevelopment, charitable activities, and services..\n\n…Therefore, El Nadeem will organize jointly with political parties and ngos a panel to discuss the status of the civil society organizations in\nEgypt in the light of the new act beside the restrictions practiced by the security authorities such as travel ban and assesses free, and others\nrestrictive to societal and development work in Egypt.\n\n[Link to the agenda and to register for the event]\n\nThe link led to a site designed to trick the target into believing that they needed to enter their password to view the file. After confirming that\nthe message was a phishing attack, we began investigation in close collaboration with EIPR’s technical team, which was by then observing a\nsecond wave of messages claiming to share a document that listed individuals subject to travel bans. The recipients were the staff of Egyptian\ncivil society organizations, many of whom suspected that they might be included on these lists.\n\nWe have now documented at least 92 messages from Nile Phish, which we link together by use of the same servers and phishing toolkit. The\nmajority of the emails were sent to the work accounts of the targets. The messages have targeted at least seven organizations, as well as a\nnumber of individual activists, lawyers, and journalists. Almost all of the targets are staff of organizations that are defendants in Case 173.\n\nThe campaign falls into two phases, which map both onto phishing style, and to different server infrastructure (See: Nile Phish Infrastructure)\n\n**What is Phishing?**\n\nPhishing is a tactic to steal personal information, like passwords, through deception. Many phishing emails often try to trick you into entering\npasswords and other secret codes into websites that look legitimate, but are really fake.\n\nWhile phishing can be used by criminal gangs to steal bank information and for other financial crimes, phishing is also used for espionage and\nsurveillance. For example, the Nile Phish operation seems to be designed to gain access to email accounts and document sharing files\nbelonging to NGOs.\n\n### Phase 1: Arrest warrants, invitations, and travel ban lists\n\n**_Late November- Late December 2016_**\n\nIn the first phase of the phishing (approximately November 24-December 26, 2016) a majority of the messages were crafted with references\nto the ongoing crackdown on civil society, and especially Case 173. Typically, the messages masqueraded as document shares, primarily via\nGoogle or Dropbox, containing highly relevant or sensitive information.\n\nThe following example of a phishing email that leveraged a recent arrest of a prominent Egyptian lawyer as a lure, illustrates that the phishing\nwas both extremely timely, and conducted by those well aware of the activities of the Egyptian government. Specifically, it suggests that within\na few hours of an arrest, the operator of the campaign was using this event as part of their phishing attack.\n\n#### An Arrest Becomes Phishing\n\nOn December 7, 2016 prominent Egyptian lawyer and the Director of the Center for Women’s Legal Assistance Azza Soliman was arrested at\nher home. Within hours, while Soliman was still being interrogated at the police station, several of her colleagues in other NGOs received an\nemail purporting to be a Dropbox share of her arrest warrant. (See: Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1. Phishing email purporting to share “Arrest Warrant Against Azza Soliman.pdf”**\n\n\nClicking on the link leads to a Dropbox credential phishing page pre-populated with the target’s username.\n\n\n**Figure 2: A fake Dropbox login page pre-populated with the identity of the target.**\n\n\nA majority of the Phase 1 messages concerned the court case, and were typically sent to targets’ organizational emails. Where targets were\nindependent activists, we also found targeting of their personal email accounts.\n\n**Example Domains from Phase 1 Phishing**\n\n**Theme** **Pretext** **Some Targeted** **Example Domains**\n**NGOs**\n\nTrial Share of travel ban list EIPR dropboxsupport.servehttp[.]com\nrelated\n\nTrial Arrest warrant of an activist arrested on the Nadeem dropbox-service.serveftp[.]com, googledriverrelated same day sign.ddns[.]net\n\nTrial Panel invitation to discuss the case [unnamed group] mailgooglesign.servehttp[.]com\nrelated\n\nTrial NGO letter to the Egyptian President about CIHRS dropbox-sign.servehttp[.]com\n\n|Theme|Pretext|Some Targeted NGOs|Example Domains|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Trial related|Share of travel ban list|EIPR|dropboxsupport.servehttp[.]com|\n|Trial related|Arrest warrant of an activist arrested on the same day|Nadeem|dropbox-service.serveftp[.]com, googledriver- sign.ddns[.]net|\n|Trial related|Panel invitation to discuss the case|[unnamed group]|mailgooglesign.servehttp[.]com|\n\n\n-----\n\ny, g, gg y\nGmail as sent over an insecure connection.\n\n**Masquerading As** **Lookalike Email**\n\nDropbox Gmail\n\ncustomerserviceonlineteam@gmail.com, drive.noreply.mail@gmail.com,secure.policy.check@gmail.com\ndropbox.notfication@gmail.com,dropbox.notifications.mails@gmail.com, (Phase 2)\ndropbox.noreplay@gmail.com\n\n### Phase 2: A Tactical Shift\n\n**Mid-December – January 31st 2016 (ongoing)**\n\nWhen we began systematically tracking the campaign in late November 2016 almost all of the messages we observed concerned issues\nrelated to Case 173, as well as being personalized to the recipient. This approach continued until late December. However, by mid-December,\nwe began observing a growing number of generic phishing messages, mostly emphasizing account security issues.\n\nHere is an example of such a “generic,” but still personalized message.\n\n|Masquerading As|Lookalike Email|\n|---|---|\n|Dropbox|Gmail|\n|customerserviceonlineteam@gmail.com, dropbox.notfication@gmail.com,dropbox.notifications.mails@gmail.com, dropbox.noreplay@gmail.com|drive.noreply.mail@gmail.com,secure.policy.check@gmail.com (Phase 2)|\n\n\n**Figure 3: Fake Gmail failed login warning message**\n\n\nThese messages, while still personalized with users’ names, relied on a range of common phishing tactics, such as warnings of suspicious\nlogin attempts, and other account security issues. In a few cases, the operators also included package-delivery notifications. After December\n\n\n-----\n\n**Theme** **Pretext** **Some Targeted NGOs** **Example Domains**\n\nGmail Failed login, EIPR, AFTE, CIHRS, Nazra, ECRF, googleverify-signin.servehttp[.]com,\nPhishing insecure a prominent journalist googlesignin.servehttp[.]com, security\nconnection, myaccount.servehttp[.]com\n\nIt is unclear why Nile Phish operators wound-down their use of Case 173 themes as the campaign went on. It is possible, for example, that\nthey began to suspect that the targets were wary of such messages. It is equally possible that they simply decided to scale back some of their\nefforts, and rely more heavily on the pre-built examples in the toolkit they used. It is also possible that this represents a fluke either in how the\nmessages were collected, or a pause on the part of the operators.\n\nThe final possibility is that Nile Phish is a component of a larger operation, and that the operators may intend to continue to use tailored social\nengineering for other purposes, such as delivering malware.\n\n#### Artefacts: Egyptian Chat Slang\n\nWhile examining the credential landing pages we also found messages and comments that the Nile Phish operators had left for each other.\n[The writing is instantly recognizable as a form of Egyptian Arabic slang (mixing letters and characters) sometimes referred as Araby.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet#Egyptian_Arabic)\n\n|Gmail Phishing|Failed login, insecure connection,|EIPR, AFTE, CIHRS, Nazra, ECRF, a prominent journalist|googleverify-signin.servehttp[.]com, googlesignin.servehttp[.]com, security- myaccount.servehttp[.]com|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nHighlighted text: “Will remove the cookies from here and point it to our server”\n\n\nHighlighted text: “Here we will insert the default username page”\n\n\nHighlighted text: “And here too take care”\n\n\n### Nile Phish Using Open-Source Phishing Toolkit\n\n[Nile Phish mounted this campaign with gophish, an open-source phishing framework written in the Go language.](https://github.com/gophish/gophish)\n\nThe gophish framework is intended to be used defensively, as part of anti-phishing trainings. This is the first offensive use of _gophish of which_\n[we are aware. Its developer describes it as “designed for businesses and penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n-----\n\nphishing campaign. While some free and hosted phishing frameworks require a degree of authentication onto a particular domain, such as the\n[online Duo Insight, many that are self-hosted do not. The lack of authentication, while minimizing invasiveness and protecting user privacy, is](https://duo.com/resources/duo-insight)\nalso a double-edged sword, and means that it can be abused to conduct non-consensual and illegal phishing campaigns.\n\n#### Discovery and Identification\n\nExamination of the phishing infrastructure provided evidence of artefacts from a cloned git repository, suggesting that this was a likely from a\nproject on Github. This led us to conclude that the operators were likely making use of an existing phishing framework. Further investigation\nrevealed that the domains were serving the gophish admin page on port 7777, and the scheme of the phishing URLs matched those of\n_gophish._\n\n\n**Figure 4: Screenshot of gophish admin interface**\n\n\nGophish links have a common format, which can be used to quickly identify a link sent via the platform.\n\n**Gophish link**\n\nhttp://[domain]/?rid=[target identifier string]\n\n#### Contact with Gophish\n\n[Citizen Lab contacted Jordan Wright, the developer of Gophish and provided examples of the links used in the campaign. Wright provided us](https://github.com/jordan-wright)\nthe following response:\n\n“…The links have the same structure as those sent in a Gophish campaign and there are Gophish administrative portals available on those\nhosts.\n\nGophish is designed to help administrators test their organization’s exposure to phishing. By running phishing tests against one’s own\norganization, the hope is that members of the organization will be better at spotting and avoiding phishing emails in the future, mitigating\nattacks like this.\n\nThe Gophish team does not condone using the software for any purpose other than running controlled tests to measure your own\norganization’s exposure to phishing. While we cannot control users and prevent all misuse of the software, we will continue taking any\nmeasures possible to prevent this kind of abuse in the future.”\n\n### Nile Phish Infrastructure\n\nThe campaign’s operators used commercial web hosting located in Europe ( [Choopa and AlexHost) to host the campaign. They have shown](https://www.choopa.com/)\nevidence of basic operational security practices, including server compartmentation between Phase 1 and Phase 2. Nevertheless, in what\n\nt h b i t k d i l d t f b th h t diff t ti\n\n\n-----\n\ng p g g p, g\nthe campaign may include a range of other targets not uncovered in our investigation.\n\n#### Phase 1 Infrastructure\n\nUsing passive DNS we found that Phase 1 included at least six domains, all hosted on 108.61.176[.]96.\n\ngoogledrive-sign.servehttp[.]com\ndropboxsupport.servehttp[.]com\ngoogledriver-sign.ddns[.]net\ndropbox-service.serveftp[.]com\ndropbox-sign.servehttp[.]com\nmailgooglesign.servehttp[.]com\n\n#### Phase 2 Infrastructure\n\nThe second phase of the campaign included at least 16 domains, hosted on IPs 104.238.191[.]204 and 176.123.26[.]42.\n\nfedex-shipping.servehttp[.]com\nverification-acc.servehttp[.]com\ngoogle-maps.servehttp[.]com\nfedex-mail.servehttp[.]com\nsecure-team.servehttp[.]com\naccount-google.serveftp[.]com\ngoogleverify-signin.servehttp[.]com\ngooglesecure-serv.servehttp[.]com\ngooglesignin.servehttp[.]com\nsecurity-myaccount.servehttp[.]com\nmyaccount.servehttp[.]com\nactivate-google.servehttp[.]com\ngooglemaps.servehttp[.]com\ndevice-activation.servehttp[.]com\naramex-shipping.servehttp[.]com\nfedex-sign.servehttp[.]com\n\n#### Additional Domains\n\nThrough passive DNS research, we identified 13 additional domains using the same dynamic DNS server and IP addresses.\n\ndropbox-verfy.servehttp[.]com\nfedex-s.servehttp[.]com\nwatchyoutube.servehttp[.]com\nmoi-gov.serveftp[.]com\nverification-team.servehttp[.]com\nsecurityteam-notify.servehttp[.]com\nsecure-alert.servehttp[.]com\nquota-notification.servehttp[.]com\nnotification-team.servehttp[.]com\nfedex-notification.servehttp[.]com\ndocs-mails.servehttp[.]com\nrestricted-videos.servehttp[.]com\ndropboxnotification.servehttp[.]com\n\n#### Linking the Infrastructure\n\nWhile the operators maintained a degree of compartmentation between domains, we found that the domain fedex-sign.servehttp[.]com\nresolved to both Phase 1 and Phase 2 infrastructure.\n\n|Domain|Resolution|Until|Infrastructure Belongs to|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n### Phishing: The Royal Road to Account Compromise\n\nReporting on targeted threats often gets attention because of the sophistication of the attackers’ tools, yet by volume many successful attacks\n[use much less advanced technology. The recent case of an iOS zero day used against UAE and Mexican civil society represents a relatively](https://citizenlab.org/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/)\nsophisticated and expensive attack vector. While such an operation is costly and relatively difficult to detect, many operations that we have\nobserved at the Citizen Lab use much less sophisticated technical means.\n\nIn this report we described how the Nile Phish operators used targeted, timely, and clever deceptions combined with an open-source phishing\nframework.\n\n#### Why Do Many Threat Actors Still Use Credential Phishing?\n\nWhile we cannot know Nile Phish operators’ reasons for choosing phishing, assuming they have access to other techniques, we can\n[speculate that they used social engineering because it works. A phishing campaign has a number of advantages, even for operators capable](http://www.johnscottrailton.com/security-for-the-high-risk-user/)\nof obtaining expensive and sophisticated malware. Indeed, even in cases where the same operators may also possess and deploy malware.\n\nAs an exercise, the following table emphasizes some of the advantages of phishing as a technique to gain access to private communications\nwhen used by a well resourced actor. The table highlights some of the reasons why such actors may continue to use phishing.\n\n#### Credential Phishing: Why it keeps being used as a surveillance tool\n\n**Concern** **Credential Phishing**\n\n**Cost / Skill** Zero or near-zero development cost.

Like the use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) malware, phishing does not instantly point to a particular\ntype of actor, such as a government, as many malicious actors use this technique. Discovery of a tool like NSO Group’s\nPegasus or Hacking Team’s Remote Control System, on the other hand, strongly implies state involvement, as they are\nmarketed for lawful intercept purposes and the cost of procuring those tools precludes those without significant resources\nfrom acquiring them. Moreover, finding phishing may not alert the target that a sophisticated attacker is present.\n\n**Diverse** Phishing does not require knowledge of a target’s devices, antivirus, or other endpoint security features.

Citizen Lab reports have repeatedly pointed out that many operators, including](https://targetedthreats.net/)\nthose with access to more sophisticated technologies, persist in phishing and other forms of basic social engineering.\n\nFor example, in South America, the [Packrat group, which was active against civil society in several countries, made use of credential phishing](https://citizenlab.org/2015/12/packrat-report/)\n[as part of its multi-year campaign.

Nor does it require a means to bypass these, such as an exploit, in order to gain access to targeted communications.|\n|Gathering relevant data|Email and online accounts often contain huge troves of data which, when compromised, can quickly be siphoned out of accounts remotely.|\n\n\n-----\n\ndefault on security features predictably leads to a lower rate of use, and keeps the door open for phishing.\n\n**What is Two Factor Authentication?** Two Factor Authentication has many names, like 2 Step Authentication, Login Approvals, 2FA, and so\non, but they typically refer to the same thing: combining a password with a second “factor” that only the authorized user has. Most commonly\nthis is a text message sent to the user’s phone. Other versions include physical tokens, code generators, authenticator apps or prompts on\ndevices, and so on.\n\n[Click here for a list of services that support Two Factor Authentication.](https://twofactorauth.org/)\n\nFrom the perspective of an NGO however, several approaches are available to increase the cost of phishing, including using more secure\nforms of 2 Factor Authentication. As a next-level step, organizations can also implement phishing / social engineering awareness exercises.\n\n**Increase the Cost to Phish an NGO**\n\n**Anti-Phishing** **Works on** **Limitations**\n**Technique**\n\n**2 Factor** Account security, means 2 Factor Authentication can still be phished in some circumstances, such as tricking\n**Authentication** that even if credentials are victims into entering codes from authenticator apps, although deceptions must be\nwith phished a second factor is more elaborate.

Although a growing number of threat actors are\n[experimenting with phishing 2 Factor credentials, and tampering with SMS-based authentication, including in Egypt, when implemented](https://citizenlab.org/2015/08/iran_two_factor_phishing/)\nsecurely the feature is a low-cost way to dramatically increase the cost-to-phish.\n\nOne way to increase the security of 2 Factor authentication is to move away from SMS-based authentication to [Authenticator Apps or, even](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en)\n[more secure, Yubikeys. Both Google and, most recently Facebook, now support Yubikeys for authentication.](https://www.yubico.com/start/)\n\n#### Next Level: Behavioral Training\n\nPhishing exploits vulnerabilities that will always be present in human behavior. When a phishing campaign like Nile Phish targets an\norganization, the operators do not expect that everyone will be duped. One compromise is enough to begin siphoning private data, and to start\nusing that data to construct more convincing phishing or malware attacks against others in an organization.\n\nThere is a growing consensus that repeated training with mock-phishing exercises, in the form of realistic phishing e-mails sent by the\norganization’s IT staff, can be an effective way to build an organization’s ‘human firewall.’ There are a number of free tools that NGOs can use\n[to conduct these exercises, including Duo Insight. Ironically, Gophish is another such tool, although it requires slightly more technical](https://duo.com/resources/duo-insight)\n[sophistication to implement. Many other solutions are available, many of them commercial. While not every organization will be able to](http://www.securitycurrent.com/en/writers/mike-saurbaugh/security-awareness-solutions-at-a-glance)\nimplement behavioral training, it is a free and highly effective strategy for reducing institutional exposure to phishing attacks and social\nengineering.\n\n#### What Technology Companies Can Do Right Now\n\nMajor online companies have been reluctant to add 2 Factor Authentication as a default for new account creation. Keeping 2 Factor an opt-in\nsecurity feature, rather than opt-out means that most users will not enable it. No exact numbers are publicly available about 2 Factor adoption\nrates, but if it looks like other opt-in choices (e.g. seat belts before being made mandatory), it is unlikely to be adopted by a majority of users.\n\n[While there are trade-offs to enabling 2 factor as a default (e.g. costs to account recovery and friction in user experience), reports like this](http://www.johnscottrailton.com/security-for-the-high-risk-user/)\none make it clear that credential phishing will continue to be widely practiced by a range of threat actors against some of the most vulnerable\nuser groups.\n\n### Conclusion: Nile Phish is yet another threat to Egypt’s Civil Society\n\n|Anti-Phishing Technique|Works on|Limitations|\n|---|---|---|\n|2 Factor Authentication with Authenticator Apps or Yubikeys|Account security, means that even if credentials are phished a second factor is still required.|2 Factor Authentication can still be phished in some circumstances, such as tricking victims into entering codes from authenticator apps, although deceptions must be more elaborate.

By exposing the Nile Phish operation, including providing more technical indicators, we hope to help potential\ntargets and other investigators identify and mitigate the campaign.\n\n### Evidence of 2 Factor Phishing\n\nSince publication, Citizen Lab and EIPR have been contacted by a number of additional targets. These targets provided us with a range of\nevidence for additional activities by Nile Phish. Importantly, it also appears that Nile Phish has engaged in phishing users of 2 factor\nauthentication. The following illustration describes this process.\n\n\n-----\n\nDiagram explaining how Nile Phish operators phish users who have enabled 2 factor authentication. [Click for hi res]\n\n\nThe phishing works in this case by tricking the victim into entering both their password and their two factor code. First, the victim is phished by\nNile Phish using a deception similar to those described in the report. If the victim is tricked into providing their password, Nile Phish sends the\nvictim a message with a link to a 2-factor code phishing page then the operators type the stolen password into Gmail They then request\n\n\n-----\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nVery special thanks to Citizen Lab colleagues including Ron Deibert, Claudio Guarnieri, Sarah McKune, Ned Moran, Masashi Crete-Nishihata,\nIrene Poetranto, Adam Senft, and Amitpal Singh.\n\nCitizen Lab also thanks T.
