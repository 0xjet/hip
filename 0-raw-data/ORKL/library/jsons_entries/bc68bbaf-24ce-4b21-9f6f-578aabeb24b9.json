    "plain_text": "# In Pursuit of Optical Fibers and Troop Intel: Targeted Attack Distributes PlugX in Russia\n\n**By Thoufique Haq & Aleksey F�**\n\n**Proofpoint researchers recently observed a campaign targeting telecom and military in Russia.**\n**Beginning in July 2015 (and possibly earlier), the attack continued into August and is currently ongoing.**\n**As a part of this campaign, we also observed attacks on Russian-speaking financial analysts working at�**\n**global financial firms and covering telecom corporations in Russia, likely a result of collateral damage�**\n**caused by the attackers targeting tactics.**\n\n**The attacks employed PlugX, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) widely used in targeted attacks.**\n**Proofpoint is tracking this attacker, believed to operate out of China, as TA459 . This same attacker is**\n**[also reported to have targeted various military installations in Central Asia in the past [1]. While the](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/11/12/korplug-military-targeted-attacks-afghanistan-tajikistan/)**\n**current campaign from this attacker has been active for a couple of months, there is evidence of**\n**activity by this attacker as far back as 2013, employing other backdoors such as Saker, Netbot and**\n**DarkStRat .**\n\n**The attacks seen in the current campaign involved spear-phishing emails that employ both exploit-**\n**laden Microsoft Word document attachments, as well as links leading to RAR archives. The email**\n**contents, filenames and decoy are all usually in Russian.�**\n\n**1. Campaign Details: Attachments**\n\n**The Microsoft Word document attachments observed in this campaign utilized CVE-2012-0158 to**\n**exploit the client and implant the PlugX RAT. For example, the attachment LTE-2600.doc (SHA:**\n**6ea86b944c8b5a9b02adc7aac80e0f33217b28103b70153710c1f6da76e36081) was sent to financial�**\n**analysts covering the telecom industry with the email Subject “Проект бизнес-плана” (“Project**\n**business-plan”). The attachment name is suited to the targets because “LTE” is a telecom term**\n**referring to Long-Term Evolution networks, typically used to describe 4G networks.**\n\n**Inspection of the document exploit employing CVE-2012-0158 also revealed that it was crafted using a**\n**builder tool, which can be seen in various artifacts visible in the document properties. (Fig.1) However,**\n**it h** **ld b** **t d th t** **d** **t b li** **th t thi b ild** **i** **l** **i** **l** **d b thi** **tt** **k** **d i**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Builder artifacts in exploit document_**\n\n**2. Campaign Details: URLs**\n\n**As a part of this campaign, the attackers also sent spear-phishing emails with URLs to RAR archive**\n**files hosted on fake domains registered for this campaign. An interesting fact that shines some light on�**\n**the social engineering tradecraft used by the group is that these domain names as well as payload file�**\n**names were not chosen at random, as is often the case, but were instead chosen to fit the specific lure.�**\n\n**For example, the RAR archive hosted on www.forum-mil[.]net/news/2015-08-03-3001.rar contained the**\n**executable file \"Воздушно-космические силы России заступили на боевое дежурство.exe”�**\n**(“Aerospace Russian forces step up military duty.exe”). Additional searching uncovered a news article**\n**with this title on a legitimate Russian-language news site: http://www.forum-**\n**mil.ru/news/vozdushno_kosmicheskie_sily_rossii_zastupili_na_boevoe_dezhurstvo/2015-08-03-3001:**\n**the malicious executable borrowed the name from the article title, and the site to host the malware**\n**mimics the site that hosts the news article.**\n\n**[In another example, the news article http://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/201508191459-88tq.htm](http://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/201508191459-88tq.htm)**\n**was used as the basis for registering the payload hosting site**\n**www[.]tvzvezda[.]net/news/forces/content/201508181025.rar. Again, the title of the article was used as**\n**the name for the executable inside the RAR archive, and it appears that many of these lures were**\n**created in a similar fashion. Specifically, the actor starts with an article describing a military-related�**\n**event and then registers a payload site and names the malware file. Table 1 shows the full list of�**\n**payload domains and sites they mimic. (A list of the payload URLs can be found in the Indicators of**\n**Compromise section at the end of this post.)**\n\n**Infection Site** **Registrant Email** **Legitimate Site Mimicked**\n\n**arms-expo[.]ru (Russian information**\n**arms-expo[.]net** **gengd@gmail.com**\n**agency on weapons)**\n\n**foru-mil[.]ru (Forum of the Ministry of**\n**forum-mil[.]net** **gengd@gmail.com**\n**Defense of Russian Federation)**\n\n**tvzvezda.ru (TV network run by**\n**tvzvezda[.]net** **hsdf@gmail.com**\n**Russian Ministry of Defense)**\n\n**rusarmy[.]net** **dolphin@yahoo.com[rusarmy[.]com (Russian army and its]**\n\n**weapons forum)**\n\n**patriotp[.]com** **dolphin@yahoo.com[patriotp[.]ru (Russian military patriot]**\n\n**recreation park)**\n\n**militarynews[.]com (US military news**\n**militarynewes[.]comgjklsdf@gmail.com**\n**portal)**\n**_Table 1: Details on domains hosting malicious RAR-archived PlugX executables_**\n\n|Infection Site|Registrant Email|Legitimate Site Mimicked|\n|---|---|---|\n|arms-expo[.]net|gengd@gmail.com|arms-expo[.]ru (Russian information agency on weapons)|\n|forum-mil[.]net|gengd@gmail.com|foru-mil[.]ru (Forum of the Ministry of Defense of Russian Federation)|\n|tvzvezda[.]net|hsdf@gmail.com|tvzvezda.ru (TV network run by Russian Ministry of Defense)|\n|rusarmy[.]net|dolphin@yahoo.com|rusarmy[.]com (Russian army and its weapons forum)|\n|patriotp[.]com|dolphin@yahoo.com|patriotp[.]ru (Russian military patriot recreation park)|\n|militarynewes[.]com|gjklsdf@gmail.com|militarynews[.]com (US military news portal)|\n\n\n-----\n\n**registrar in Beijing: Shanghai Meicheng Technology Information Development Co., Ltd. .

As**\n**a result, the actual payload may never execute in malware sandbox environments unless the sandbox**\n**is configured to simulate the action of a user closing the decoy document. The SFX script for this�**\n**document (Fig. 3) appears to have been created with a Chinese language pack version of WinRAR.**\n**The decoy document “1.doc” is executed first and waits until it is closed before launching “0810.exe”.�**\n**This effect can be easily achieved in WinRAR by setting the “Wait and return exit code” option when**\n**creating the SFX archive.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3: RAR SFX script_**\n\n**3.

Over the duration of the campaign both of these domains pointed to the same infrastructure**\n**on the IP address “43.252.175.119” in Hong Kong.

These additional malware families used by this attacker in the past were**\n**Saker, Netbot and DarkStRat. Researchers at ESET also reported and documented the usage of**\n**DarkStRat by this attacker [1].**\n\n**4.1. Related Malware: Saker (aka XBox) implant**\n\n**The samples from the Saker cluster exhibited clues that also point to a Russian military attack nexus.**\n**For example, the file “zamysel praticteskih dejstvi voisk.scr” (SHA:�**\n**556e7e944939929ca4d9ca6c54d9059edf97642ece1d84363f2d46e2e8ca72ae), translates to “plan of**\n**army practice maneuvers.scr”. It was also similarly packaged in a RAR archive, and on execution it**\n**drops and loads a DLL file “icwnet.dll” (SHA:�**\n**1a789568a53c18dab21c9c0386c746878cf8458e3369f0dc36a285fe296f3be3) which contains the**\n**exports “ServiceMain” and “JustTempFun”. The malware makes the following beacon to a remote**\n**server:**\n\n**GET /30106C07000038FE0F00<removed>0000000000000000000000000000000000000000**\n**0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000<**\n**removed>000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000**\n**0000 HTTP/1.1**\n**User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.**\n**1.4322)**\n**Host: www.leeghost.com:1037**\n**Cache-Control: no-cache**\n\n**This backdoor has been analyzed extensively in the past [4] and provides the attacker a range of**\n**functionality, including file manager (enumerate, create, copy, move, delete); the ability to download�**\n**and run secondary payloads; and deleting all traces of itself and shutting down.**\n\n**4.2. Related Malware: Netbot (aka TornRat) Implant**\n\n**When an example payload (SHA:**\n**277fe4dab731149f3d40630f2f8b25092b007c701f04b5304d3ba9570280d015) from this cluster is**\n**detonated, it drops and loads a DLL file “taskhost.dll” (SHA:�**\n**dd9d31c3acb4299619c2251698024da1ac9ec42280aa6c16cd2369907f3be4e3).

The**\n**encrypted beacon contains hostname, system memory, OS information and infection timestamp. (Fig.**\n**6)**\n\n**_Figure 6: Netbot network beacon decoded_**\n\n**Samples from this cluster were found creating the following mutexes.**\n\n**Winlogin Running!**\n\n**Netbot2012 Is Running!**\n\n**NetBotServer Is Running!**\n\n**It is worth noting that there is similarity in mutex naming scheme to another malware family called**\n**NetTraveler (aka Travnet). Netbot is a backdoor and has commands to support features similar noted**\n**above for Saker, such as file manager (enumerate, create, copy, move, delete), ability to download and�**\n**execute secondary payloads; and deleting all traces of itself.**\n\n**4.3. Related Malware: DarkStRat implant**\n\n**When an example payload (SHA:**\n**b38aa09a2334e11a73ef9a926694f2054789934daa38afeb8d00bce6949b6c4c) from this cluster is**\n**detonated it drops and runs an executable file “netlink.exe” (SHA:�**\n**b38aa09a2334e11a73ef9a926694f2054789934daa38afeb8d00bce6949b6c4c). The RAT sends the**\n**string \"ok\\n\" following initial beacon to a remote server. A configuration file “netsetting.ini” is also written�**\n**to disk with the following contents:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**HostPort=443**\n\n**HostName=www.dicemention.com**\n\n\n**DarkStRat is a full-fledged RAT written in Delphi with an array of features such as file manager,�**\n**process manager, registry manager, service manager, downloading and running secondary payloads**\n**and deleting all traces of itself.**\n\n**As also noted by the ESET researchers [1], the strings in this RAT strangely show Spanish language**\n**[origins, albeit with some Chinese connections. The source code for this RAT is hosted on google code](https://code.google.com/p/darkstrat/)**\n**with the name “DarkStRat 2008 1.0开源.rar”. The string “开源.” in the name translates to “Open**\n**Source”. Various parts of the source code also have strings in Chinese and reference “darkst[.]com”**\n**and “fsg2[.]cn”. The owner of this Google-hosted code project is listed as darkteam...@gmail.com. As a**\n**result, it can be inferred that code from a Spanish RAT was repurposed by malware author with**\n**Chinese origins and marketed as DarkStRat, but as is often the case we should caution against a**\n**definitive attribution based solely on characteristics such as language and C2 server locations.�**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n**A detailed examination of this operation reveals an adversary who demonstrates a keen interest in**\n**Russian telecom and military sectors, indicative of an actor with geopolitical motives. The attacker**\n**adapts and evolves their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) over time as the situation**\n**demands. While the attacker appears to do very little to hide their tracks, they remain highly determined**\n**and persistent and have carried out attacks through a sustained operation spanning at least two years,**\n**and possibly longer. The attacker also invests time to research the locale and current events relevant to**\n**their targets and then leverages this in their targeting tactics. Attacks such as these have become a**\n**constant occurrence given the covert nature of digital attacks and easy access to targeting information**\n**online.**\n\n**As this threat shows, attackers continue to employ increasingly sophisticated techniques against new**\n**targets in order to uncover and steal sensitive information. Organizations need to recognize that they**\n**cannot rely on traditional antivirus and anti-spam solutions to detect and stop these advanced threats.**\n**In order to combat targeted attacks, organizations should adopt next-generation solutions that make it**\n**possible to identify and respond to sophisticated targeted attacks by correlating advanced detection**\n**with threat intelligence about actor TTPs and global views of threat traffic, including IOCs that enable�**\n**response teams to quickly detect and mitigate compromises. Moreover, a multi-layer approach is**\n**essential, with email security representing the logical starting point for an advanced threat defense: like**\n**this targeted attack, email remains the vector-of-choice for penetrating target organizations and**\n**delivering these sophisticated payloads.**\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n**_PlugX Infection URLs:_**\n\n**http://www.arms-expo[.]net/news/content/387206.rar**\n\n**http://arms-expo[.]net/news/content/day_2015-08-20.rar**\n\n**http://arms-expo[.]net/news/samaia_mochnaia_iagernaia_bomba_v_istorii.rar**\n\n**http://www.arms-expo[.]net/news/content/20150818.rar**\n\n**http://www.tvzvezda[.]net/news/forces/content/201508181025.rar**\n\n\n-----\n\n**http://www.arms-expo[.]net/news/content/VTC.rar**\n\n**http://www.rusarmy[.]net/forum/vvs/modernizirovanoj.rar**\n\n**http://www.rusarmy[.]net/forum/threads/sostojanie-krejserov-proekta-1144.9.rar**\n\n**http://www.forum-mil[.]net/news/2015-08-03-3001.rar**\n\n**http://www.militarynewes[.]com/news/11.08.2015.rar**\n\n**_PlugX hashes (SHA256):_**\n\n**1aa6c5d0c9ad914fb5ed24741ac947d31cac6921ece7b3b807736febda7e2c4b**\n\n**1b32825f178afe76e290c458ddbf8a3596002c6f9a7763687311f7d211a54aab**\n\n**3e824972397b322ea9f48fd1a9a02bd6c3eb68cc7de3a4f29e46a5c67b625ec1**\n\n**49e1f953dc17073bf919972868576b93cc9f3b5b9600f98a0bd9e39e5d229d9e**\n\n**4cadbdb5a09781555cc5d637d3fecf89b9a66fac245d6a3a14989f39a9a48c6e**\n\n**67cccfa23a7fd1d9ca8160cd977d536c4a40bf9525a93aa4122a89527a96fa8f**\n\n**6ea86b944c8b5a9b02adc7aac80e0f33217b28103b70153710c1f6da76e36081**\n\n**7efcf2211cd68ab459582594b5d75c64830acf25bcaab065bbd60377fb9eb22a**\n\n**8702506e8e75834a8f011cfc268d02043af5522aeda20a8458880c8fbed7ecac**\n\n**8a5df5f31a3b4f893a0565967d64e57f41d91e3592bbd8d52f98f81b3fb8452b**\n\n**_Saker hashes (SHA256):_**\n\n**556e7e944939929ca4d9ca6c54d9059edf97642ece1d84363f2d46e2e8ca72ae**\n\n**0d2600d978f5c1042e93b701654db080aac144dfa2877844334b1d4cd78f4a1d**\n\n**2a6dee57cb302a1350ade4a33f40a77c1952cf2e6b29d1be8400c13927e34670**\n\n**383c5d22c1de3aae7684eb5a7d87d6b553f09f166ca402894c5deecabaa7d866**\n\n**53d29782b8c325c2ff62493cdb261a8e54e45ed04880527e75e8e211b4d8d861**\n\n**5d97ec30c481e00d4285246b528745f331be905f453e062bd9c2d506e9386f0e**\n\n**664f80b427bf0145e62f6f90cb4833c30cfb8dc4b2d68746aa01420da82bd8af**\n\n**6dc560a3b20a6e95552254bdb04fba03f74223a83a58436a3decfab74abc5fb5**\n\n**a2f4aa2d25bff21e73b15065e2fc38d297ee14253044a66d00690b1bb23fc373**\n\n**c7d7211d1fea69ea6a9697a8f8d21ac40f6d7dc6863708b9a98930271a156c86**\n\n**d2a5cf434e8a0c63c23e6a3e5cf8a60f259099a706d2d243ffa5c7dbd46fd9d4**\n\n**d6ff406da6e9a20074c3e1228ab04d35a3839b1719d3cafbb21ad3e3b6d03ef4**\n\n**df4571b7d3be63de8338e6905b2689309ed5cce88d57a8db0c7b9aebf713d81c**\n\n**d7771339794 7908865f7816513b593369 93 98b39f58 b** **98f3f0067 9d**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Netbot hashes (SHA256):_**\n\n**4524ede160d5476211e99329768b38abd88aacb6fa9334f2c2bbcaab9b0438f5**\n\n**317e9deef23ff0e919083ac6c94b5ccd3bb0227f674078d66cdd4a2e5d1ebba9**\n\n**68a98b8e174cb5af20e0ac97978bad6d245a1cb0970b82a4a269a92e7726d74b**\n\n**277fe4dab731149f3d40630f2f8b25092b007c701f04b5304d3ba9570280d015**\n\n**f95c6749f4d4fae18f9d384f495dc1c79e7484b309d0d35ea68966763ed325bd**\n\n**_DarkStRat hashes (SHA256):_**\n\n**b38aa09a2334e11a73ef9a926694f2054789934daa38afeb8d00bce6949b6c4c**\n\n**0d219aa54b1d417da61bd4aed5eeb53d6cba91b3287d53186b21fed450248215**\n\n**_C2 domains observed:_**\n\n**pressmil[.]com**\n\n**notebookhk[.]net**\n\n**dicemention[.]com**\n\n**leeghost[.]com**\n\n**_References:_**\n\n**[[1] http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/11/12/korplug-military-targeted-attacks-afghanistan-tajikistan/](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/11/12/korplug-military-targeted-attacks-afghanistan-tajikistan/)**\n\n**[[2] http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2015/01/analysis-of-a-r-ff05.html](http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2015/01/analysis-of-a-r-ff05.html)**\n\n**[[3] https://github.com/arbor-jjones/volatility_plugins](https://github.com/arbor-jjones/volatility_plugins)**\n\n**[4] http://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/kaspersky-the-net-traveler-**\n**part1-final.pdf�**\n\n**[[5]http://blog.crowdstrike.com/whois-anchor-panda/](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/whois-anchor-panda/)**\n**Tuesday, September 15, 2015 -
