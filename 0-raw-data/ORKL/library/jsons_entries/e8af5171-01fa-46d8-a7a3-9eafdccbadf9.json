    "plain_text": "# Pylocky Unlocked: Cisco Talos releases PyLocky ransomware decryptor\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/01/pylocky-unlocked-cisco-talos-releases.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/01/pylocky-unlocked-cisco-talos-releases.html)**\n\n\n-----\n\n_[This tool was developed by Mike Bautista.](https://twitter.com/miguelraulb)_\n\nPyLocky is a family of ransomware written in Python that attempts to masquerade as a Locky\nvariant. This ransomware will encrypt all files on a victim machine before demanding that the\nuser pay a ransom to gain access to their decrypted files. To combat this ransomware, Cisco\n[Talos is releasing a free decryption tool. Because our tool requires the capturing of the initial](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/pylocky_decryptor)\nPyLocky command and control (C2) traffic of an infected machine, it will only work to recover\nthe files on an infected machine where network traffic has been monitored. If the initial C2\ntraffic has not been captured, our decryption tool will not be able to recover files on an\ninfected machine. This is because the initial callout is used by the malware to send the C2\nservers information that it uses in the encryption process.\n\nWhen PyLocky executes it generates a random user ID and password and gathers\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation about the infected machine using WMI wrappers. It also generates a random\ninitialization vector, or IV, which is then base64 encoded and sent to the C2 server along with\nthe system information the malware has gathered. After obtaining the absolute path of every\nfile on the system, the malware then calls the encryption algorithm, passing it the IV and\npassword. Each file is first base64-encoded before it is encrypted. The malware appends the\nextension \".lockedfile\" to each file it encrypts - for example, the file \"picture.jpg\" would\nbecome \"picture.jpg.lockedfile.\" The original file is then overwritten with the attacker's\nransom note.\n\n_Example of a PyLocky ransom note._\n\nTalos encourages users never to pay an attacker-demanded ransom, as this rarely results in\nthe recovery of encrypted files. Rather, victims of this ransomware should restore from\n[backups if their files cannot be decrypted Just as in the June 2017 Nyetya attack Talos has](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/worldwide-ransomware-variant.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nobserved on numerous occasions that attackers who are demanding ransoms may have no\nway to communicate with victims to provide a decryptor.
