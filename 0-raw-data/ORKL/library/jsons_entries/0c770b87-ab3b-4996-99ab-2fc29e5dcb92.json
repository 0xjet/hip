Reasons for Taiwan being targeted range from being\none of the sovereign states of the disputed South China Sea region to its emerging economy and growth with Taiwan being one of the most\ninnovative countries in the High-Tech industry in Asia.\n\nIn early August, Unit 42 identified two attacks using similar techniques. The more interesting one was a targeted attack towards the Secretary\nGeneral of Taiwan's Government office – Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has several individual boards which are formed to enforce\ndifferent executing functions of the government. The Executive Yuan Council evaluates statutory and budgetary bills and bills concerning\nmartial law, amnesty, declaration of war, conclusion of peace and treaties, and other important affairs. Given the important functions\nundertaken by the Executive Yuan office, it is not a surprise that they were targeted. The second attack was against an energy sector company\nalso located in Taiwan.\n\n[The attacks in this case are associated with a campaign called Tropic Trooper, which has been active since at least 2011 and is known for](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf)\nheavily targeting Taiwan. One of the attacks used their known Yahoyah malware, but the other attack deployed the widely available Poison Ivy\nRAT. This confirms the actors are using Poison Ivy as part of their toolkit, something speculated in the original Trend Micro report but not\nconfirmed by them. Further analysis uncovered a handful of ties indicating the actors may also be using the PCShare malware family, which\nhas not been previously tied to the group.\n\nFigure 1 shows the spear phishing email which was sent to the Secretary General of Executive Yuan. The email is spoofed so that it appears\nas though it was sent from a staff member at the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1. Spear-phishing email with malicious attachment._**\n\nThe document attached to this e-mail exploits CVE-2012-0158, a Microsoft Office vulnerability. This process is described in the Malware\nAnalysis section later in this report, but one interesting aspect of this malicious was the decoy document the attacker chose to deploy.\n\n## Decoy Document\n\nAs we have noted in many earlier reports, attackers commonly use decoy files to trick victims into thinking a malicious document is actually\nlegitimate. After infecting the computer, the display a clean document to the victim that contains content that is relevant to them.\n\nThe decoy document used in this case is a spreadsheet with four tabs, respectively titled “example,” “0720,” “0721,” and “1041109 full update”.\nAll of the text uses Traditional Chinese, in contrast to Simplified Chinese, which is the official written language of the People's Republic of\nChina. Traditional Chinese is used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and many overseas Chinese communities. The overarching theme of the\nspreadsheet is documenting protestor activity and/or progressive reform attempts in progress across Taiwan and the tone of the spreadsheet\nsuggests it was compiled by progressive supporters. Because we were unable to find the spreadsheet online, and there is specific persona\ndata included related to these movements and protests, we are not including any screen shots except for the one below.\n\n**_Figure 2. The four tabs in the decoy spreadsheet._**\n\nThe “example” spreadsheet tab is exactly as described – it contains the headers and suggested information within two of the remaining three\ntabs. The headers themselves translate, from left to right, to “responsible department,” “issue,” “developments this week,” “political situation\njudgment,” and “related information.” The tab labeled 0721 only has the matching headers and no additional information. None of the\ninformation in the spreadsheet relates to activities past 2015, and there are references made to the then upcoming January 16, 2016 elections\nin Taiwan. In that election the DPP won, displacing the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for only the second time in history, and with Taiwan’s\nfirst female President.\n\nThe spreadsheet labeled 0720 refers to the Anti-Black Box Movement, which was a protest by Taiwanese high school students against certain\nproposed curriculum changes. The use of “black box” by the protestors is in reference to former Taiwanese President Ma Ying-Jeou’s\ngovernment and its lack of transparency concerning government decisions. Protestors occupied Taiwan’s Ministry of Education last July. A\nresolution passed by Taiwan’s legislature and approved by the Executive Yuan in May of this year delayed implementing that curriculum until\n2020 to allow time for the act to be amended.\n\nThe Anti-Black Box Movement is related to the Sunflower Student Movement, a coalition of both student groups and other civic organizations\nthat protested the Cross-Strait Trade Agreement between Taiwan and the PRC, feeling it would hurt Taiwan’s economy and increase the\nPRC’s sway over the island. On March 17 2014, the KMT, the ruling party at the time, tried to force a vote without a previously agreed clause\n\n\n-----\n\nby c ause e e t t e e o o g e e g p oteste s occup ed t e eg s at e ua, t e st t e t at ad occu ed a a s\nhistory. On March 23 of the same year, after then President Ma re-affirmed he supported the pact and would not alter or drop it, protestors\noccupied the Executive Yuan where over 150 were injured and 61 arrested.\n\nThe final tab contains the most information of the three and has different headers. From left to right, the headers are titled “responsible\nperson(s),” “summary of issues and major groups,” “crisis simulation, political judgment, and recommendations,” “degree of tension,” and\n“participating members.”\n\nInformation related to the November 2015 \"Autumn Struggle\" protest, which is an annual protest first done in 2013.\nInformation on a Taichung City government development proposal being protested largely on environmental impact grounds, and\nprotestor demands.\nArmy 1 Special Forces veterans attempt to receive compensation for alleged illegal extension of forced military servicest\nThe recently settled case where toll workers forced into unemployment by the Taiwanese government’s agreement with the Far Eastern\nElectronic Toll Collection Company to create a national electronic toll collection system ended up resulting in the 2013 layoffs of\nhundreds, who have since protested for new jobs as well as lost severance and pension.\nKaohsiung refinery closing and protestor demands, also largely related to environmental effects and necessary cleanup; the refinery\nofficially closed at the end of December 2015\nClosely watching any trade agreements between the Malaysian government and Taiwan\nPotential environmental and current residential issues related to the development of the Aerotropolis around Taoyuan International\nAirport, which is intended to create a major transportation hub and industry center for Asia with infrastructure for corporate research and\ndevelopment, conference centers, and other facilities.\nThe Puyu Development Plan, which is part of Taiwan’s Knowledge-based Economy plan\nTaiwan’s 12-year compulsory education plan\nAnti-Black Box Movement demands and recent activity\nImproving working conditions for Taiwanese firefighters\nPension reforms\nThe Nest Movement, which started in 2014 and is related to the older “Shell-less Snail Movement,” focused on affordable housing,\nneighborhood and urban development, ending forced demolition and relocation, property tax reform, and related housing issues\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) voted on by the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) for the Dongshi-Fengyuan\nExpressway, part of the National Highway #4 Project and anti-eviction efforts\nKaohsiung water quality issues and related projects\nSame sex marriage legalization\nProtecting old trees in Kaohsiung amidst construction for a new “green” library; most of the designated “precious trees” are rare exotic\nspecies\nIndigenous peoples in Kaohsiung land return\nActivities against the Miramar Resort Village, including the revocation of the EIA, forcing development to halt\nLowering the voting age in Taiwan from 20 to 18\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\n[The documents attached to spear-phishing e-mails used in both attacks contain code that exploits CVE-2012-0158, which despite its age](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical%20papers/CVE-2012-0158-An-Anatomy-of-a-Prolific-Exploit.PDF)\nremains one of the most common Microsoft Word vulnerabilities being exploited by multiple threat actors. This matches with known Tactics,\nTechniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for Tropic Trooper, targeting both government institutions and also the energy industry in Taiwan.\n\nThe delivery document uses the XLSX extension typically used by OpenXML documents, but the file itself is actually an OLE (XLS) document.\nThe file extension to file type discrepancy was caused by the actor using Excel's built-in encryption capability, which stores XLSX ciphertext\nand the information needed for decryption in an OLE document.\n\nFilename: 進步議題工作圈議題控管表.xlsx\n\nMD5: a89b1ce793f41f3c35396b054dbdb749\n\nSHA1: f45e2342e40100b770d73dd06f5d9b79bfce4a72\n\nSHA256: 2baa76c9aa3834548d82a36e150d329e3268417b3f12b8f72d209d51bbacf671\n\nType: CDF V2 Document, No summary info\n\nSize: 327128 bytes\n\n**_Table 1. Details of the malicious document attached to the e-mail._**\n\nThe embedded shellcode enumerates open handles for a file with a size greater than 0xa6f0 (Decimal - 42736) bytes. It will then set the file\npointer to 0xa6e8 (Decimal - 42728) and starts looking for the following delimiter:\n\n**GfCv\\xef\\xfe\\xec\\xce**\n\nIf it finds this delimiter, the shellcode knows it is working with the correct file and continues by reading 0x600 (decimal 1536) bytes following\nthis delimiter. The shellcode then decrypts the first 0xc0 (decimal 192) DWORDs of the data read from the file using an XOR algorithm that\ndecrypts one DWORD of ciphertext at a time with 0x29f7c592. The resulting cleartext is a second piece of shellcode that continues carrying\nout further functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\ne seco da y s e code sta ts by eso g t e o o g u ct o s us g a O 3 as g a go t\n\nkernel32.dll!CreateFileA\nkernel32.dll!ReadFile\nkernel32.dll!WriteFile\nkernel32.dll!SetFilePointer\nkernel32.dll!CopyFileA\nkernel32.dll!MoveFileExA\nkernel32.dll!CreateToolhelp32Snapshot\nkernel32.dll!Process32Next\nkernel32.dll!CloseHandle\nkernel32.dll!VirtualAlloc\nkernel32.dll!WinExec\nkernel32.dll!TerminateProcess\nkernel32.dll!LoadLibraryA\nkernel32.dll!lstrlenA\nkernel32.dll!lstrcpyA\nkernel32.dll!lstrcatA\nkernel32.dll!GetTempPathA\nkernel32.dll!WideCharToMultiByte\nkernel32.dll!QueryDosDeviceA\nntdll.dll!NtQueryObject\nadvapi32.dll!RegOpenKeyA\nadvapi32.dll!RegSetValueExA\nadvapi32.dll!RegCloseKey\n\nImmediately following these API functions there are three DWORDS; one used to locate the payload embedded within the exploit file, one for\nthe size of the payload, and one for the size of decoy document. The two size values are added together to get the length of the ciphertext that\nthe shellcode will decrypt. In the sample we analyzed, the following values were present, showing that the payload is at offset 0xabc0 and has\na size of 0x45218:\n\nDWORD offset_toPayload; (0ABC0h)\nDWORD payload_Size; (1C600h)\nDWORD decoy_Size; (28C18h)\n\nThe shellcode then creates a string that it uses to create a registry key to automatically run the final payload each time the system starts. It\nthen opens the registry key 'Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon' and sets the value to the \"Shell\" subkey to the\npreviously created string. Ultimately, the following registry key is created for persistence:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell:\n\"explorer.exe,rundll32.exe \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application\nData\\Identities\\Identities.ocx\" SSSS\"\n\nIt then uses the \"offset_toPayload\" value as an offset that it will read 283160 (45218h) bytes from the XLS file. The shellcode then enters a\ndecryption loop to convert the embedded payload from ciphertext to cleartext. The algorithm uses the length of the ciphertext negated as the\ninitial encryption key, which it bit rotates right by 1 to adjust the key for each of decryption. It will use this key to decrypt four bytes of the\nciphertext with the XOR operation until all the ciphertext is decrypted. During each iteration of the decryption process, the algorithm will check\nto make sure the four bytes of ciphertext are not equal to the key or equal to zero before decrypting the ciphertext. The following table\ncontains the first five rounds of the algorithm to explain the decryption process:\n\n**Key** **Ciphertext** **Cleartext**\n\n0 ~0x45218 = 0xFFFBADE8 >> 1 = 0x7FFDD6F4 0x7F6D8CB9 0x00905a4d = MZ\\x90\\x00\n\n1 0x7FFDD6F4 >> 1 = 0x3FFEEB7A 0x3FFEEB79 0x03 = \\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n2 0x3FFEEB7A >> 1 = 0x1FFF75BD 0x1FFF75B9 0x04 = \\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n3 0x1FFF75BD >> 1 = 0x8FFFBADE 0x8FFF4521 0xFFFF = \\xff\\xff\\x00\\x00\n\n4 0x8FFFBADE >> 1 = 0x47FFDD6F 0x47FFDDD7 0xB8 = \\xb8\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n5 0x47FFDD6F >> 1 = 0xA3FFEEB7 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n6 0xA3FFEEB7 >> 1 = 0xD1FFF75B 0xD1FFF71B 0x40 = \\x40\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n7 0xD1FFF75B >> 1 = 0xE8FFFBAD 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n8 0xE8FFFBAD >> 1 = 0xF47FFDD6 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n\n-----\n\n9 0xF47FFDD6 >> 1 = 0x7A3FFEEB 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n10 0x7A3FFEEB >> 1 = 0xBD1FFF75 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n11 0xBD1FFF75 >> 1 = 0xDE8FFFBA 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n12 0xDE8FFFBA >> 1 = 0x6F47FFDD 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n13 0x6F47FFDD >> 1 = 0xB7A3FFEE 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n14 0xB7A3FFEE >> 1 = 0x5BD1FFF7 0x00000000 0x00000000 = \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\n15 0x5BD1FFF7 >> 1 = 0xADE8FFFB 0xADE8FEF3 0x108 = \\x08\\x01\\x00\\x00\n\n16 0xADE8FFFB >> 1 = 0xD6F47FFD 0xD84E60F3 0xEBA1F0E = \\x0e\\x1f\\xba\\x0e\n\n17 0xD6F47FFD >> 1 = 0xEB7A3FFE 0x26738BFE 0xCD09B400 = \\x00\\xb4\\x09\\xcd\n\n18 0xEB7A3FFE >> 1 = 0x75BD1FFF 0x39BCA7DE 0x4C01B821 = \\x21\\xb8\\x01\\x4c\n\n19 0x75BD1FFF >> 1 = 0xBADE8FFF 0xD28AAE32 0x685421CD = \\xcd!Th\n\n20 0xBADE8FFF >> 1 = 0xDD6F47FF 0xAD4F3496 0x70207369 = is p\n\n21 0xDD6F47FF >> 1 = 0xEEB7A3FF 0x9CD0CC8D 0x72676F72 = rogr\n\n22 0xEEB7A3FF >> 1 = 0xF75BD1FF 0x947BBC9E 0x63206D61 = am c\n\n23 0xF75BD1FF >> 1 = 0xFBADE8FF 0x94C3869E 0x6F6E6E61 = anno\n\n24 0xFBADE8FF >> 1 = 0xFDD6F47F 0x98B4D40B 0x65622074 = t be\n\n25 0xFDD6F47F >> 1 = 0xFEEB7A3F 0x909E081F 0x6E757220 = run\n\n**_Table 2.

In the other two instances the delivered payloads were respectively PCShare and Yahoyah. PCShare has not\nbeen previously associated with Tropic Trooper, but in addition to the aforementioned overlaps, the two samples have passive DNS overlap\nwith some known Tropic Trooper infrastructure. For those reasons, we assess with limited confidence the group is also using this malware\nfamily.\n\n**_Figure 3.
