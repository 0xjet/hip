If you need to decrypt versions**\n**1, 4, 5.0.1 through 5.2, then download and run our new tool linked below.**\n\nIn February 2018, Bitdefender released the world’s first decryption tool to help GandCrab\nransomware victims get their data and digital lives back for free. But since then, victims of\nsubsequent versions of GandCrab and its ‘ransomware-as-a-service’ affiliate approach have\nbeen reaching out to us for help.\n\nThe good news is that now you can have your data back without paying a cent to cybercriminals. Bitdefender offers a free utility that automates the data decryption process.\n\n**Supported GandCrab Versions**\n\nThe below table shows the versions of GandCrab this tool can decrypt and how to identify\nthe version you have been inflicted with. You can recognize this ransomware and its version\nby the extension it appends to the encrypted files and/or from the first line of the ransomnote.\n\n\nVersion 1: file extension is\n.GDCB.\n\nVersion 2: file extension is\n.GDCB.\n\nVersion 3: file extension is\n.CRAB.\n\n\nStarts with —= GANDCRAB =—, ……………. the\nextension: .GDCB\n\nStarts with —= GANDCRAB =—, ……………. the\nextension: .GDCB\n\nStarts with —= GANDCRAB V3 =— ……….. the\nextension: .CRAB\n\n\n-----\n\nVersion 4: file extension is\n.KRAB.\n\nVersion 5: file extension is .\n([A-Z]+).\n\n\nVersion\n5.0.1:\n\nVersion\n5.0.2:\n\nVersion\n5.0.3:\n\nVersion\n5.0.3:\n\nVersion\n5.0.5:\n\nVersion\n5.0.5:\n\n\nfile extension is .\n([A-Z]+).\n\nfile extension is .\n([A-Z]+).\n\nfile extension is .\n([A-Z]+).\n\nfile extension is .\n([A-Z]+).\n\nfile extension is .\n([A-Z]+).\n\nfile extension is .\n([A-Z]+).\n\n\nStarts with —= GANDCRAB V4 =— ……….. the\nextension: .KRAB\n\nStarts with —= GANDCRAB V5.0 =— ………. the\nextension: .UKCZA\n\nStarts with —= GANDCRAB V5.0.1 =— …. the\nextension: .YIAQDG\n\nStarts with—= GANDCRAB V5.0.2 =— …. the\nextension: .CQXGPMKNR\n\nStarts with—= GANDCRAB V5.0.3 =— …. the\nextension: .HHFEHIOL\n\nStarts with—= GANDCRAB V5.0.4 =— …. the\nextension: .BYACZCZI\n\nStarts with—= GANDCRAB V5.0.5 =— …. the\nextension: .KZZXVWMLI\n\nStarts with—= GANDCRAB V5.1 =— …. the extension:\n.IJDHRQJD\n\n\n**Decryption Tool Requirements**\n\n**Active Internet connection. This tool REQUIRES an active Internet connection as our**\nservers will attempt to reply to the submitted ID with a possibly valid RSA-2048 private\nkey. Only if this step succeeds will the decryption process continue.\n**The ransom-note. For this recovery solution to work, you must have at least (1) copy**\nof the ransom-note on your PC. The ransom-note is needed to recover the decryption\nkey, as it allows us to compute the unique decryption key for your files. Please make\nsure that you do not run a clean-up utility which detects and removes the ransom-note\nprior to execution of this tool.\n\n**How to Use the Tool**\n\n**Step 1: Download our decryption tool and save it somewhere on your computer. Please note**\nthat this tool requires an active internet connection. Without it, the decryption process won’t\ncontinue.\n\n[Download the GandCrab decryptor](http://download.bitdefender.com/am/malware_removal/BDGandCrabDecryptTool.exe)\n\nThis tool REQUIRES an active internet connection as our servers will attempt to reply the\nsubmitted ID with a possibly valid RSA-2048 private key. If this step succeeds the decryption\nprocess will continue.\n\n**Step 2: Run the utility. It should be saved on your computer as BDGandCrabDecryptor.exe.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Step 3: Agree to the terms and conditions.**\n\n**Step 4: Select “Scan Entire System” if you want to search for all encrypted files or just add**\nthe path to your encrypted files. We strongly recommend that you also select “Backup files”\nbefore starting the decryption process. Then press “Scan”.\n\nRegardless of whether you check the “Backup files” option or not, the decryption tool\n**initially attempts to decrypt (5) files in the provided path and will NOT continue if**\n**decryption is unsuccessful. This extra safety mechanism ensures that the decryption tool**\nhas yielded valid files. This approach will however, impact potential tests ran on 1 or 2 files,\nor rypting files with different extensions.\n\n**Step 5: At this point, your files should be decrypted. If you selected the backup option, you**\nwill see both the encrypted and the decrypted files. We recommend that you now validate\nthat your files may be safely opened and there is no trace of damage.\n\nOnce you have validated your files, you can remove the encrypted files in bulk by searching\nfor files matching the GandCrab extension.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please contact us at via the e-mail address provided in the\nremoval tool.\n\n**Acknowledgement**\n\nThis product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL\n[Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)](http://www.openssl.org/)\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[free tools](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/free-tools/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Bogdan BOTEZATU\n\n[Information security professional.
