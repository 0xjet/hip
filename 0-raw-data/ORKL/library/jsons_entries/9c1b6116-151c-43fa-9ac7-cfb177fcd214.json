Over three months,\nProofpoint observed three subtle variations of this attack chain. Proofpoint attributes these\n[campaigns to TA402, an actor commonly tracked as Molerats and believed to be operating in](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-ta402-molerats-malware-targets-governments-middle-east)\nthe interest of the Palestinian Territories. Based on Proofpoint’s research, TA402 is a\npersistent threat to organizations and governments in the Middle East, routinely updating\nnot only their malware implants, but also their delivery methods. After publication of\nProofpoint’s TA402 research in June 2021, TA402 appeared to halt its activities for a short\nperiod of time, almost certainly to retool. Proofpoint researchers believe they used that time\nto update their implants and delivery mechanisms, using malware dubbed NimbleMamba\nand BrittleBush. TA402 also regularly uses geofencing techniques and varied attack chains\nwhich complicate detection efforts for defenders.\n\n## Campaign Details\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. TA402 attack chain November 2021 to January 2022._\n\nIn the recently observed campaigns, TA402 used spear phishing emails containing links that\noften lead to malicious files. Proofpoint observed three different URL types in those\ncampaigns.\n\n**Variation 1: Actor-Controlled Domain (November 2021)**\n\nIn a November 2021 campaign, TA402 masqueraded as the Quora website while using an\nactor-controlled Gmail account with an actor-controlled domain. The malicious URL, such as\nhttps[:]//www[.]uggboots4sale[.]com/news15112021.php, in the phishing email was\ngeofenced to the targeted countries. If the target's IP address fits into the targeted region, the\nuser would be redirected to the RAR file download containing the latest TA402 implant,\nNimbleMamba. If outside the target area, the user would be redirected to a legitimate news\nsite, Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Benign redirect to legitimate news site https[:]www[.]emaratalyoum[.]com._\n\n**Variation 2: Dropbox URL (December 2021)**\n\nIn December 2021, TA402 used multiple phishing pretenses, including clickbait medical\nlures and ones allegedly sharing confidential geopolitical information. TA402 continued to\nuse an actor-controlled Gmail account but shifted to Dropbox URLs to deliver the malicious\nRAR files containing NimbleMamba. This shift away from actor-controlled domains meant\nthat TA402 could no longer geofence their payloads. Proofpoint discovered that TA402 is not\nonly abusing Dropbox services for delivery of NimbleMamba, but also for malware command\nand control (C2). Proofpoint has shared our investigation and analysis with Dropbox prior to\npublication, and they took the needed actions for neutralizing the activity within their\norganization.\n\n**Variation 3: WordPress Redirect Actor-Controlled Domain (December**\n**2021/January 2022)**\n\nIn their latest campaigns, TA402 continued to use lure content customized for each of their\ntargets but slightly adjusted their attack chain by inserting an additional actor-controlled\nWordPress URL. That WordPress site (Figure 3), which impersonates a news aggregator of\nthe legitimate news site from Variation 1, likely redirects to the download site of the\nmalicious RAR files containing NimbleMamba if the visitor is coming from an IP within the\n\n\n-----\n\ntargeted region. If the source IP address does not align with the target region, the URL will\nredirect the recipient to a benign website, typically an Arabic language news website (Figure\n2).\n\n_Figure 3. Example WordPress site (https[:]//emaratalyoumcom[.]wordpress[.]com/)_\n_impersonating an Arabic language news aggregator._\n\nThe use of geofenced URLs, Dropbox URLs and then redirect URLs demonstrate TA402’s\ndetermination to blend in with legitimate email traffic and infect targets with\nNimbleMamba.\n\n## Malware Analysis: NimbleMamba \n\nEach variant of TA402’s attack chain led to a RAR file containing one or multiple malicious\ncompressed executables. These executables include a TA402 implant Proofpoint dubbed\nNimbleMamba and oftentimes an additional trojan Proofpoint named BrittleBush.\nNimbleMamba is almost certainly meant to replace LastConn, which\nProofpoint [reported about in June 2021. LastConn was likely an updated version of the](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-ta402-molerats-malware-targets-governments-middle-east)\n[SharpStage malware, reported by Cybereason in December 2020. While NimbleMamba and](https://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/Molerats-in-the-Cloud-New-Malware-Arsenal-Abuses-Cloud-Platforms-in-Middle-East-Espionage-Campaign.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nLastConn have some similarities, such as being written in C#, base64 encoding within the C2\nframework, and use of the Dropbox API for C2 communication, there appears to be little\ncode overlap between the two.\n\nNimbleMamba uses guardrails to ensure that all infected victims are within TA402’s target\nregion. NimbleMamba uses the Dropbox API for both command and control as well as\nexfiltration. The malware also contains multiple capabilities designed to complicate both\nautomated and manual analysis. Based on this, Proofpoint assesses NimbleMamba is actively\nbeing developed, is well-maintained, and designed for use in highly targeted intelligence\ncollection campaigns.\n\nFor this malware analysis, Proofpoint researchers analyzed the following two samples:\n\n**SHA256**\n\nSample c61fcd8bed15414529959e8b5484b2c559ac597143c1775b1cec7d493a40369d\n1\n\nSample 430c12393a1714e3f5087e1338a3e3846ab62b18d816cc4916749a935f8dab44\n2\n\nNimbleMamba is written in C# and delivered as an obfuscated .NET executable using third[party obfuscators. Both samples analyzed used the SmartAssembly obfuscator. Additionally,](https://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/smartassembly/)\nthe malware does basic virtual machine checks to avoid detection by looking for common\nstrings that indicate a sample is running in a virtual environment.\n\n## Guardrails\n\nNimbleMamba contains multiple guardrails to ensure that the malware only executes on\ntargeted machines. It uses the following IP resolving web services to check the user’s IP\naddress and determine if it fits into the target region. This is done to avoid detection and\n\n|Col1|SHA256|\n|---|---|\n|Sample 1|c61fcd8bed15414529959e8b5484b2c559ac597143c1775b1cec7d493a40369d|\n|Sample 2|430c12393a1714e3f5087e1338a3e3846ab62b18d816cc4916749a935f8dab44|\n\n\n-----\n\nanalysis.\n\n[api[.]ipify[.]com (https://www.ipify.org)](https://www.ipify.org/)\n[myexternalip[.]com (https://myexternalip.com)](https://myexternalip.com/)\n[ip-api[.]com (https://ip-api.com)](https://ip-api.com/)\n[api[.]ipstack[.]com (https://ipstack.com)](https://ipstack.com/)\n\nIf the machine is unable to connect to those services, the malware will keep calling the\naddresses in random order, thus putting the execution in an endless loop in closed network\nenvironments.\n\nThe malware will only continue executing if the country of the resolved IP address country\ncode matches one from the following table or if the host computer has an Arabic language\npack (code “AR”) installed.\n\n**Code** **Country**\n\nKW Kuwait\n\nEG Egypt\n\nIL Israel\n\nSA Saudi Arabia\n\nIR Iran\n\nAE United Arab Emirates\n\nTN Tunisia\n\nDZ Algeria\n\nSY Syria\n\nQA Qatar\n\nJO Jordan\n\n|Code|Country|\n|---|---|\n|KW|Kuwait|\n|EG|Egypt|\n|IL|Israel|\n|SA|Saudi Arabia|\n|IR|Iran|\n|AE|United Arab Emirates|\n|TN|Tunisia|\n|DZ|Algeria|\n|SY|Syria|\n|QA|Qatar|\n\n\n-----\n\nOM Oman\n\nPS Palestine\n\nLB Lebanon\n\nLY Libya\n\nSS South Sudan\n\nSSD Soud Sudan (Alpha-3 code, probably added by accident)\n\nIQ Iraq\n\nYE Yemen\n\nMA Morocco\n\nBH Bahrain\n\n## Configuration\n\n[NimbleMamba’s configuration is retrieved from a paste on the website JustPasteIt.](https://justpaste.it/)\nNimbleMamba takes the current timestamp from an online real-time service to ensure that\nthe timestamp matches the current time. Some computers may have modified time settings\nand this method ensures that the time is standardized across infections. The obtained\ntimestamp is then used to generate a JustPasteIt URL with the algorithm in Figure 4.\n\n|PS|Palestine|\n|---|---|\n|LB|Lebanon|\n|LY|Libya|\n|SS|South Sudan|\n|SSD|Soud Sudan (Alpha-3 code, probably added by accident)|\n|IQ|Iraq|\n|YE|Yemen|\n|MA|Morocco|\n|BH|Bahrain|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Python implementation of NimbleMamba’s JustPasteIt algorithm._\n\nWhen there is an active paste under the generated URL, it should look like this:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Example of JustePasteIt paste content._\n\nThe data taken from the paste service is split by “#” and then each split by “=” to form the\nfollowing two key-value pairs.\n\n**Key** **Value**\n\nACSS IFK641c5_RQj32p_HvJF14U3eu3iQIl1vYncq-5g4aMKQAAAAAAAAAAQ6MoiJpHT88KFIEQQ2SH5\n\nOOOO 40,1ckZnB3a45mMpRTTYplNiNmZ\n\nACSS contains the obfuscated Dropbox account API auth key that is used for C2\ncommunication. The malware then takes the external IP address, username and computer\nname retrieved earlier, writes them as comma-separated strings, base64 encodes them with\nstripped padding bytes and then reverses the string. The resulting string is used as a folder\nname that is created on the Dropbox account using their API with the API key deobfuscated\n(Figure 6) from the JustPasteIt post.\n\n|Key|Value|\n|---|---|\n|ACSS|IFK641c5_RQj32p_HvJF14U3eu3iQIl1vYncq-5- g4aMKQAAAAAAAAAAQ6MoiJpHT88KFIEQQ2SH5|\n|OOOO|40,1ckZnB3a45mMpRTTYplNiNmZ|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Dropbox API key deobfuscation._\n\nFrom there, the malware starts communicating with Dropbox to obtain a RAR file and a\ndecoy file that is immediately displayed to the user if present. The decoy file is often an office\ndocument or PDF. The RAR file is password-protected with a password stored as the second\ncomma-separated value in the OOOO argument from the JustPasteIt paste and dropped to\nthe folder pointed by the first parameter in OOOO. The downloaded RAR file contains two\nadditional executables, an updated sample of NimbleMamba along with an executable that\ncontains a screenshot of the functionality. This technique allows for TA402 to serve\nadditional payloads to targeted NimbleMamba victims.\n\n[Pivoting on the JustPasteIt user “Nefaty Benet” (Researcher Note: This account is likely](https://web.archive.org/web/20220104165321/https://justpaste.it/u/nefaty_benet)\nmeant to impersonate the Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett) allows us to see that the\nNimbleMamba campaign likely started in August 2021, two months after Proofpoint’s\nprevious research. This timeframe is consistent with the compile dates of the NimbleMamba\nsamples identified in VirusTotal.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Pivot to all pastes created by user “Nefaty Benet.”_\n\n## Functionality\n\nNimbleMamba has the traditional capabilities of an intelligence-gathering trojan and is likely\ndesigned to be the initial access. Functionalities include capturing screenshots and obtaining\nprocess information from the computer. Additionally, it can detect user interaction, such as\nlooking for mouse movement.\n\n## BrittleBush Trojan\n\nLater versions of the RAR files that deliver NimbleMamba also included a small trojan\napplication Proofpoint dubbed BrittleBush\n(2E4671C517040CBD66A1BE0F04FB8F2AF7064FEF2B5EE5E33D1F9D347E4C419F). This\ntrojan communicated with easyuploadservice[.]com and received commands as base64\nencoded JSON structure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. BrittleBush JSON structure._\n\n## Attribution\n\nProofpoint attributes the campaigns to TA402 based on both technical indicators and\nvictimology. The observed attack chains mimic historical TA402 campaigns, some of which\n[are discussed in Proofpoint’s June 2021 research. The phishing campaigns share thematic](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-ta402-molerats-malware-targets-governments-middle-east)\nelements with historical Molerats campaigns. For example, the December 2021 campaign\ncontained a title bearing significant similarities to a 2015 TA402 campaign reported\nby [Kaspersky.](https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-wheres-your-ir-team/72283/)\n\n**Campaign** **Arabic Title** **Translation**\n\n2015 “ﻣﻜﺎﻟﻤﺔ ﻣﺴﺮﺑﺔ ﺑﯿﻦ اﻟﻘﺎﺋﺪ اﻟﻌﺎم ﻟﻠﻘﻮات Leaked conversation with the Egyptian\nKaspersky اﻟﻤﺴﻠﺤﺔ اﻟﻤﺼﺮﯾﺔ ﺻﺪﻗﻲ leader of military forces Sodqi Sobhi[.]exe\nCampaign ﺻﺒﺤﻲ.exe”\n\nDecember ﻟﻘﺎء ﺳﺮي ﺑﯿﻦ ﺑﻦ ﺳﻠﻤﺎن واردوﻏﺎن ﻓﻲ Secret meeting between bin Salman and\n2021 ﻗﻄﺮ Erdogan in Qatar\nCampaign\n\nThe campaigns observed by Proofpoint likely occurred concurrently to Zscaler’s recently\n[published research on Molerats activity targeting individuals in Palestine & Turkey and](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/new-espionage-attack-molerats-apt-targeting-users-middle-east)\ndemonstrate Molerats continued ability to modify their attack chain based on their\nintelligence targets.\n\nThe significant technical connections between the DropBox accounts used by the LastConn\nmalware, the account used to deploy NimbleMamba, and the account used to store\nintelligence exfiltrated by NimbleMamba indicate that LastConn and NimbleMamba are\nalmost certainly deployed by the same operators. This was based on the findings found\nduring the investigation performed by Dropbox Security Team, which neutralized all the\nassociated accounts.\n\n|Campaign|Arabic Title|Translation|\n|---|---|---|\n|2015 Kaspersky Campaign|“تاﻮﻘﻠﻟ مﺎﻌﻟا ﺪﺋﺎﻘﻟا ﻦﯿﺑ ﺔﺑﺮﺴﻣ ﺔﻤﻟﺎﻜﻣ ﻲﻗﺪﺻ ﺔﯾﺮﺼﻤﻟا ﺔﺤﻠﺴﻤﻟا ﻲﺤﺒﺻ.exe”|Leaked conversation with the Egyptian leader of military forces Sodqi Sobhi[.]exe|\n|December 2021 Campaign|ﻲﻓ نﺎﻏودراو نﺎﻤﻠﺳ ﻦﺑ ﻦﯿﺑ يﺮﺳ ءﺎﻘﻟ ﺮﻄﻗ|Secret meeting between bin Salman and Erdogan in Qatar|\n\n\n-----\n\n[Technical intelligence, including analysis of Molerats network activity from TeamCymru,](https://team-cymru.com/blog/2022/01/26/analysis-of-a-management-ip-address-linked-to-molerats-apt/)\nindicates NimbleMamba developers operate in the interest of the Palestinian Territories. The\nguardrails employed by NimbleMamba demonstrate a clear focus on targeting Arabic\nspeakers along with computers in the Middle East. Proofpoint observed campaigns targeting\nMiddle Eastern governments, foreign policy think tanks, and a state-affiliated airline.\nProofpoint assesses TA402 likely operates in support of Palestinian objectives, which is\nconsistent with prior Proofpoint and the broader industry’s previously published\nassessments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTA402 continues to be an effective threat actor that demonstrates its persistence with its\nhighly targeted campaigns focused on the Middle East. Based on the variations between\ncampaigns delivering NimbleMamba, along with the historical pattern of developing new\nmalware post disclosure, Proofpoint judges with moderate confidence that TA402 will\ncontinue to update both their implants and infection chains to complicate defensive efforts.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n|IOC|IOC Type|\n|---|---|\n|430c12393a1714e3f5087e1338a3e3846ab62b18d816cc4916749a935f8dab44|SHA256|\n|c61fcd8bed15414529959e8b5484b2c559ac597143c1775b1cec7d493a40369d|SHA256|\n|uggboots4sale[.]com|Domain|\n|925aff03ab009c8e7935cfa389fc7a34482184cc310a8d8f88a25d9a89711e86|SHA256|\n\n\n-----\n\neasyuploadservice[.]com Domain\n\n2e4671c517040cbd66a1be0f04fb8f2af7064fef2b5ee5e33d1f9d347e4c419f SHA256\n\n**ET Signatures**\n\n2035112 TA402/Molerats CnC Checkin\n\n2035113 TA402/Molerats Payload Downloaded\n\n2035120 TA402/Molerats CnC Activity\n\n2035121 TA402/Molerats External IP Lookup Activity\n\n2035122 TA402/Molerats Related Malware Domain in DNS Lookup\n\n2035123 TA402/Molerats Related Malware Domain in DNS Lookup\n\n**YARA Signatures**\n\nrule Proofpoint_Molerats_TA402_NimbleMamba {\n\nmeta:\n\ndescription = \"Detects .NET written NimbleMamba malware used by TA402/Molereats\"\n\nauthor = \"Proofpoint Threat Research\"\n\ndisclaimer = \"Yara signature created for hunting purposes - not quality controlled within\nenterprise environment\"\n\nhash1 = \"430c12393a1714e3f5087e1338a3e3846ab62b18d816cc4916749a935f8dab44\"\n\nhash2 = \"c61fcd8bed15414529959e8b5484b2c559ac597143c1775b1cec7d493a40369d\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$dotnet = \"#Strings\" ascii\n\n$dropbox = \"dropboxapi.com\" ascii wide\n\n$justpaste = \"justpaste.it\" wide\n\n$ip_1 = \"api.ipstack.com\" wide\n\n|2e4671c517040cbd66a1be0f04fb8f2af7064fef2b5ee5e33d1f9d347e4c419f|SHA256|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n$ip_2 = myexternalip.com wide\n\n$ip_3 = \"ip-api.com\" wide\n\n$ip_4 = \"api.ipify.com\" wide\n\n$vm_1 = \"VMware|VIRTUAL|A M I|Xen\" wide\n\n$vm_2 = \"Microsoft|VMWare|Virtual\" wide\n\ncondition:\n\nuint16be(0) == 0x4D5A and $dotnet and $dropbox and $justpaste and any of ($ip_*)\nand any of ($vm_*)\n\n}\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\nSelect\n\n\n-----",
