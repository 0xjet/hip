The messages reveal close relationships among\n\n\n-----\n\n[multiple threat groups and details about the GOLD ULRICK and](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-ulrick) [GOLD BLACKBURN threat](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-blackburn)\ngroups' operations. Leaked source code and tool repositories offer unprecedented insights\ninto previously unknown threat actors.\n\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have historically linked most of the\nactivity referenced in the leaked data to two disparate but highly integrated threat groups:\n\nGOLD BLACKBURN - This financially motivated cybercrime group has been active\nsince June 2014. The threat actors authored and operated the TrickBot malware from\nlate 2016 until March 2022 and have also distributed malware such as BazarLoader,\nAnchor, Zloader, and Buer Loader.\nGOLD ULRICK - This financially motivated cybercrime group active has been active\nsince mid-2018. It focuses exclusively on organization-wide ransomware attacks. The\ngroup distributed the Ryuk ransomware from August 2018 until early 2021 and has\ndistributed the Conti ransomware since early 2020.\n\nIn GOLD ULRICK incidents analyzed by CTU™ researchers, the initial access vector used to\ndistribute the Ryuk and Conti ransomware was usually TrickBot, BazarLoader, or another\nGOLD BLACKBURN malware payload. The PowerShell Empire and Cobalt Strike Beacon\ncommand and control (C2) servers used in these attacks were frequently shared by TrickBot,\nindicating that a single entity maintained infrastructure for both threat groups. However, other\nthreat groups have used TrickBot to distribute ransomware such as RansomExx (also known\nas 777), Maze, and LockBit.\n\nThe leaked messages reveal that the 'Stern' persona is a leader who makes key\norganizational decisions, distributes payroll, manages crises, and interacts with other threat\ngroups (see Figure 1). Stern's purview includes all aspects of ransomware distribution as\nwell as TrickBot and BazarLoader operation. This relationship suggests that Stern has a\nleadership role in both GOLD BLACKBURN and GOLD ULRICK. The messages also include\nindividuals representing GOLD CRESTWOOD (Emotet), GOLD MYSTIC (LockBit), and\nGOLD SWATHMORE (IcedID), who frequently communicate with Stern and other GOLD\nULRICK and GOLD BLACKBURN members. Despite the connection to multiple groups, CTU\nanalysis does not suggest that Stern leads all of these groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Personas involved in leaked messages, organized by possible organizational_\n_structure based on communications. (Source: Secureworks)_\nThe chats reveal a mature cybercrime ecosystem across multiple threat groups with frequent\ncollaboration and support. Members of groups previously believed to be distinct collaborated\nand frequently communicated with members of other threat groups. This interconnectivity\nshows these groups' motivations and relationships. It highlights their resourcefulness and\nability to leverage subject matter expertise within the groups.\n\nA June 29, 2021 message from the 'Mango' persona to Stern highlights the groups' biweekly\nsalary breakdown (see Figure 2). It describes an operation with 81 people. The average\nsalary per individual is approximately $1,800 USD per month, exceeding the average\nRussian salary of approximately $540 USD per month. As of July 1, 2021, the Bitcoin\naddress at the bottom of the message had received 2.31 bitcoins (approximately $80,000\nUSD at that time).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Payroll message from Mango persona to group leader Stern (translated from_\n_Russian). (Source: Secureworks)_\nOther leaked data included more than a dozen dossiers of threat actors with photos, names,\naddresses, phone numbers, bank account numbers, passport, and citizenship information.\nThe identity and motives of the individual who leaked these dossiers are unknown, so CTU\nresearchers cannot determine if the data is reliable or if it was modified before release. The\nindividual expressed anger toward Russia, so the leaks could be in response to pro-Russian\nstatements GOLD ULRICK posted on its leak site.\n\nAs of March 6, 2022, GOLD ULRICK was posting new victims to its leak site. The group's\nattacks have impacted hundreds of victims and include many high-profile attacks. The\nexposure from the leaked data could cause the group to cease operation, or could be\nanother obstacle for the threat actors to overcome.\n\nThreat Intelligence Executive Report, Vol 2022, No. 2\n\nGet the latest Threat Intelligence Executive Report from the Secureworks Counter Threat\nUnit™\n\n[Read Now](https://www.secureworks.com/resources/rp-threat-intelligence-report-2022-vol-2)\n\n\n-----",
