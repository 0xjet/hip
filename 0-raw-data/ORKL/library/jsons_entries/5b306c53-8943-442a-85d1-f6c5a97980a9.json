Historically, the general structure of\nthese C2s has followed suit with how most of our networking communications have been\nbuilt: as a client-server model. The client, which in this case is an infected host, is configured\nto communicate directly with a server in order to determine any actions it needs to take. In\nalmost every malware analysis report you read, you’ll probably see one or more IP\naddresses or domain names that the piece of malware (which in C2 lingo is referred to as an\nimplant) is configured to “check in” with and obtain “action requests” from. Once these IP\naddresses or domain names are identified and made public, defenders simply check their\nnetwork for hosts calling to those IPs, terminate the implants running on those hosts, then\nblock egress/ingress traffic to those IPs or domain names to prevent future issues with the\ncampaign. Then, predictably, the threat actor, now seeing their command servers noted as\nan Indicator of Compromise (IoC), switches up their infrastructure, updates their implants to\ncall to different command servers, and continue on with their campaign. This scenario is\nobviously very much simplified, but its a pattern that we see constantly in the perpetual game\nof cat and mouse between attackers and defenders.\n\nHowever, how would this scenario change if the domain name being called by the implant is\ndrive[.]google[.]com? What about reddit[.]com, or github[.]com? Would you, as a defender,\nbe able to block traffic going to those domains to prevent the effectiveness of the implant? Of\ncourse not; the users on your network would be cut off from major sites that may be critical to\ntheir day-to-day operations. When you analyze the traffic destined for these domains, would\nyou be able to determine when traffic is malicious and when its your users simply using the\nservices normally? Maybe, though it certainly won’t be easy; at least, not nearly as easy as\nseeing traffic going to imac2server[.]cn and knowing right away that the traffic is bad news.\n\nWhat I have just described is what we’re going to be talking about in this writing. A public\nplatform C2, which I’ll be abbreviating to “P2C2,” is a Command and Control structure that\nuses legitimate, innocuous platforms to facilitate server-implant communications. In essence,\nP2C2s use a reputable service as a proxy, masking the identity of the actual attacking\ninfrastructure and hiding C2 traffic within a sea of innocuous HTTPS traffic that makes up the\nvast majority of today’s network communications.\n\n\n-----\n\n[For the past few months, I have been incrementally working on a project called redViper,](https://github.com/itsKindred/redViper)\nwhich is a C2 Framework that uses Reddit for all of its implant-server communications. While\nworking on the project, I’ve really enjoyed facing the challenges and reaping the benefits that\ncome with using a P2C2. While redViper is very much a proof of concept and isn’t particularly\nsophisticated (especially the current implant code, which is largely just a placeholder), I\nnonetheless am really happy with how the project turned out, and it has solidified my belief\nthat using a public platform as a means of C2 communications could actually be a viable\nsolution attackers, especially in environments where traffic is extensively filtered. In this\nwriting, I’m going to discuss the advantages, disadvantages and use cases of P2C2s, using\nnot only my experience building redViper, but also using examples of P2C2s that already\nhave been used in the wild.\n\n## Advantages of a P2C2\n\nWhen it comes to covert channels and communications, I am a strong believer in the concept\nof obscurity through uniformity. From a defensive perspective, threat hunting and security\noperations are based almost solely on the concept of anomaly detection. By asking “what\ntraffic and activity aren’t normal to my network?”, and having the means of finding that traffic,\ndefenders can oftentimes catch malicious activity. By definition, the concept of uniformity\nnullifies the concept of anomaly. Think of, for example, school uniforms. When students are\nable to wear whatever clothes they want, every person appears unique and differentiable;\neven if you couldn’t see their faces, you could easily differentiate each student from one\nanother based on the difference in clothing. When students are forced to wear a school\nuniform, however, it becomes much more difficult. Sure you could maybe identify each\nindividual by their body shape or height, but as you can imagine, it becomes a lot harder to\ntell who’s who.\n\nThis is what I find the ideal scenario to be when it comes to C2 communications; if my\nmalicious traffic is wearing the same uniform as Karen-from-accounting’s web surfing,\ndefenders are going to have a tough time finding my needle in their haystack of standard\nweb traffic. We can actually see attackers chase this desired uniformity over time in the\nevolution of C2s. Initially, many C2s used their own binary protocols that used some arbitrary\nport to communicate on, which quickly became easy to catch. Nowadays, most notable C2s\nused by threat actors use some form of HTTP or HTTPS for communicating, which makes\nthe task of finding C2 traffic a bit tougher since, as we talked about earlier, HTTP(s) is what\nmost standard network traffic consists of. P2C2s take another step in this direction by saying\n“you know what, not only am I going to use the same protocol as most of your network traffic,\nI’m going to go to the same PLACES as most of your traffic.” It is this concept that\nencompasses the first core advantage of P2C2s: the natural innocuity of the\ncommunications. Without diving VERY deep into the traffic content itself, the traffic being\n\n\n-----\n\nsent from and to implants looks completely innocent; Its over an encrypted HTTPS\nconnection, going to a well-known, trusted site. To the average eye, it looks like a normal\nuser using some commonly used website.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, first of all, it nullifies essentially every security tool or application\nthat operates lower than Layer 7; packet filtering is useless, stateful firewalls are useless,\nand even many application firewalls will be of very little use. By using a P2C2, you have\nmade almost every firewall on the planet a waste of metal. Second, it drastically reduces the\nchances of a blue teamer ever taking the time to analyze your traffic. If I see a mass of traffic\ngoing to thnxforthedata[.]ru, a domain I’ve never seen in my entire life, I’m going to question\nthe legitimacy of that traffic and take a closer look at it. If I see a mass of traffic going to\nreddit[.]com, my first thought isn’t, “well I should probably look into this.” I’d assume, as well\nas almost every person on the planet would as well, that the traffic going to reddit[.]com is,\nwell, someone browsing reddit. The discovery of P2C2 communications is almost always\ngoing to be from the discovery of an IoC other than the network traffic itself (discovery of\nimplant, malicious commands being detected, etc), which means that if I build potent\nimplants and operate responsibility, my dwell time will likely exponentially exceed what it\nwould be if my implants were calling back to a suspicious hostname/IP or using a custom\nprotocol.\n\nThe second core advantage of P2C2s is the inconsequentiality, and as a result the pseudoresilience, of an attacker’s infrastructure. Think about how you as a regular user traditionally\ninteract with, for example, Reddit: you use the browser of a desktop computer, login to the\nReddit website, then you go about using the site. Did it matter what browser you used, or the\ncomputer you logged in from? Would you be able to achieve the same results if you were on\nan entirely different host, in an entirely different network, using an entirely different browser?\nOf course. In order to use the Reddit platform reliably, the only thing that must remain static\nand available is Reddit itself. If your desktop computer explodes while you’re using Reddit,\nyou don’t permanently lose the ability to access your account; you simply just have to use a\ndifferent computer.\n\nThe same is true for an attacker utilizing a P2C2. The actual system that’s running the C2\nserver application is largely inconsequential. All the C2 server is really doing is just logging\ninto a public platform and interacting with it, just like a normal user does. If for some reason\nan attacker’s infrastructure is burned, becomes unusable, or has access revoked, it does not\nnullify or doom the P2C2; The implants are still talking to the public platform, and will\ncontinue to do so even if the system the attacker was working from is dead, since the\nimplants don’t have the inclination or even the CONCEPT of attacker-controlled\ninfrastructure. If I, as an attacker, need to move my core operations to another system, I can\ndo so with great ease; I just have to re-run the server application using the same credentials\nfrom another host, and from the implants perspective absolutely nothing has changed. This\n\n\n-----\n\ncreates the concept of a notional infrastructure: The attacker is of course operating from\nsomewhere, but since that source can’t possibly be extracted from the P2C2 independently,\nand can change with phenomenal ease, that infrastructure might as well only exist in theory.\n\nAgain, this generates two advantages, resilience and anonymity. It builds natural resilience\nbecause the functioning of the P2C2 is dependent on the uptime of the public platform, NOT\nthe attacker’s infrastructure; and, generally speaking, popular public platforms will be far\nmore resilient and reliable than disparate hosts under the control of a malicious actor.\nSecond, because all the implants communicate directly with a public platform, and not an\nattacker-controlled server, the location, composition and even the existence of the attacker’s\ninfrastructure is unknown to defenders. The most that can be known is what accounts are\nbeing used by the actor on the specific public platform, which gives very little information\nregarding the actor itself. In other words, actors who use P2C2s will no longer be attributed\nto a set of IPs and domains, they’ll instead be attributed to accounts, which are far more\ndisposable, flexible and replicable.\n\nAll of this together paints a picture that the utilization of a P2C2 instead of a traditional C2\ncan make both the detection and attribution of an actor exponentially more difficult in the\nright circumstances, which is obviously very advantageous to an attacker.\n\n## Disadvantages of a P2C2\n\nJust like everything in life, garnering positive outcomes is often going to come at the expense\nof other things. That remains true for P2C2s as well; what we gain in anonymity and\ncovertness, we lose in control and independence. Let’s talk about the problems that could be\nran into when using a P2C2 from two different perspectives: a legally contracted red team,\nand an actual criminal threat actor.\n\nThe primary issue of using a P2C2 as a red teamer or pentester is moreso a legal one than a\ntechnical one. I am by no means a law expert so take what I say with a grain of salt, but from\nmy understanding it would be quite difficult to use a P2C2 within the context of a contractual\nagreement with an organization, because in many ways you’re taking potentially private\ninformation from that organization and placing it on a public platform. It you run the “cat\n/home/bob/employee_info.txt” command using a P2C2, what you’re essentially doing is\ntelling your customer’s computer to take private organizational data, and place it on a third\nparty’s infrastructure. Now, in the case of redViper, and in most P2C2 implementations, this\ndata will be encrypted and protected in a multitude of ways (In the case of redViper, the data\nis encrypted and sent on a private subreddit with restrictive access), so the chances of an\nunauthorized person seeing this data is quite low. However, this doesn’t change the fact that\nthe confidential data of one party is being temporarily placed on the infrastructure of another\nintermediary party which has not been tied into a contractual agreement. Based on my very\n\n\n-----\n\nlimited knowledge of the legal side of penetration testing, this could cause some issues, and\nprevent P2C2s from being able to be properly tested against corporate networks, which in\nsome ways is another advantage from the perspective of real threat actors.\n\nIn terms of an actual threat actor, there exists a few disadvantages as well, both technical\nand non-technical. I think its important to highlight these disadvantages, because\nunderstanding the issues real threat actors may face helps us anticipate and act against\nthese threat actors. First and foremost, in the context of criminal activity, there is an inherent\nrisk involved in utilizing the services of a legitimate platform. In almost every circumstance,\nlegitimate platforms have a means of reaching any and all content that traverses their\nservice. In the case of Reddit, for example, anything posted on a subreddit, private or not,\nCAN be accessed by Reddit retroactively, even in the case of that post or comment being\ndeleted. So what does this mean for threat actors? Well, it means that law enforcement has\nan opportunity to access vast amounts of communications done by their C2, which can\nreveal troves of information about their campaign that can contribute to legal proceedings. If\nlaw enforcement is able to obtain a single implant containing credentials related to your\nP2C2 activity, they could then in theory obtain legal authority to get ALL activity for that\nspecific account from the associated platform. This risk does not exist when using a\ntraditional C2s, since communications are shared between the implant and an independent\nserver that the attacker controls, with no other parties in the middle (barring ISPs). Therefore,\na serious criminal actor who has to legitimately worry about law enforcement will always\nhave that Achilles heel scenario where the platform they’re using pulls the rug out from under\nthem, which could ultimately land them in a jail cell.\n\nAnother issue that may arise, which exists for both legal and illegal actors, is the lack of\ncontrol the attacker has over their communication infrastructure. When an attacker has full\ncontrol over the infrastructure running a C2, that attacker can explicitly determine when the\ninfrastructure is available, when it’s down for maintenance, and when it needs to “lay low.”\nThis same control does not exist if you’re using a public platform. The attacker doesn’t\ndecide when their communication platform is available; another party does. If Reddit goes\ndown for maintenance, or has some sort of technical issue, attackers using redViper are\nessentially in the dark if they are relying exclusively on redViper for communications. Now, in\npractice, it is very uncommon for major platforms like Reddit or Gmail to be completely\nunavailable, so this issue is, in my view, not too major. So much so, that you may remember\nthat I highlighted the uptime of public platforms as an advantage to P2C2s. However, the\nlack of control is still something that has to be taken into account.\n\nNow that some of the advantages and disadvantages of these C2s are drawn out, let’s touch\non two miscellaneous topics that I feel are also important to note.\n\n## Viable Platforms for a P2C2\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first miscellany I want to talk about is what makes a public platform viable for use with a\nP2C2. While nearly any public platform can be manipulated for communications, there are\ncertain features that make a platform more viable for scalable campaigns.\n\nFirstly, in order for a platform to be utilized in a coherent P2C2 the platform must have a\nsomewhat mature and accessible API. Programmatically interacting with any sort of service\nrequires an API that developers can easily utilize; this remains true for P2C2 developers as\nwell. In the case of Reddit, I was able to use praw, which is a comprehensible python module\nthat interacts with the quite feature-rich Reddit API. Without this mature API, it would have\nbeen much more difficult to build a working framework, likely to the point where developing\nthe P2C2 over the platform would be nonviable.\n\nThe next requirement is disposable and easy-to-obtain accounts and API keys. In my view, in\norder to build a truly secure and formidable P2C2 campaign, an attacker needs a multitude\nof accounts that can be used to interact with their select platform. This allows implant builds\nto be dispersed between an abundance of accounts, reducing the damage done of having a\nsingle account from your campaign exposed. In the case of Reddit, creating an account\nrequires no confirmed email, no API “justification request,” and no account requirements\n(there’s one exception to this, but I’ll disregard it for the sake of brevity). While developing\nredViper, I was able to spin up new Reddit accounts to hook to my implants in less than 5\nminutes. Compare this to a platform like Twitter, where you need a confirmed email address\nand an API justification form filled out and approved, and its easy to see why Reddit is\ngenerally more fit for P2C2 activity compared to Twitter.\n\nThe final requirement is the ability to control access to your communications within the\nplatform. Currently, there are three platforms in which I have working P2C2 PoCs on:\nDiscord, Google Sheets and Reddit. Each of these platforms serve my purposes because\nthere’s a way to control access to communications: For Discord, an invite only channel can\nbe established so only implant/master accounts can send or receive messages. For Google\nSheets, permissions for a sheet can be selectively granted to Google accounts. For Reddit,\nan invite-only private subreddit can be established in which only implant accounts are invited.\nIn all of these cases, unauthorized access to C2 communications can be prevented by only\nallowing accounts associated with a campaign to see the communications. The only way a\nparty other than the attacker can see communications is if one of the accounts are\ncompromised.\n\nIn my opinion, a platform that meets these three core requirements can very well be a viable\nsolution for building a P2C2 framework. With that, let’s jump into the next topic, where we\nbriefly explore past examples of public platforms being used for C2 purposes.\n\n## Real Examples of P2C2 usage\n\n\n-----\n\nAs stated in the beginning of this writing, I have frequently used redViper as a discussion\npoint because its a project that I comfortably understand. However, redViper is far from the\nfirst example of a P2C2; there have been multiple instances of public platforms being used\nby real threat actors. Let’s briefly dive into some examples of real threat actors utilizing public\nplatforms for malicious purposes.\n\n1. LOWBALL: The LOWBALL backdoor, utilized by APT “admin@338,” used the Dropbox\n\nservice for C2 communications. Command requests are sent as files to the Dropbox\nplatform, which are then downloaded and executed by implants, with output being\nuploaded back to Dropbox. Implants have a Dropbox Bearer API hard-coded into them,\n[allowing access to the Dropbox account. Here is a full writeup from FireEye for more](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/11/china-based-threat.html)\ndetails.\n2. ROCKRAT: The ROCKRAT Trojan was discovered by Cisco’s Talos Group, and was\n\nfound to use Mediafire, Yandex and Twitter Cloud for C2 and data exfiltration activities.\nThe threat actor utilizing this RAT has yet to be confirmed, though its largely assumed\nto be North Korean. [Here is a full writeup from Cisco Talos for more details.](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/11/ROKRAT-Reloaded.html)\n3. DarkHydrus: DarkHydrus is an Iranian threat group that utilizes the RogueRobin\n\ntrojan. This malware uses primarily DNS tunneling for C2 communications, however\nnewer C# versions of the malware have an “x_mode” option, which makes the implant\n[use the Google Drive API for C2 communications instead of DNS Tunneling. Here is a](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/darkhydrus-delivers-new-trojan-that-can-use-google-drive-for-c2-communications/)\nfull writeup from Palo Alto’s Unit 42 group for more details.\n4. Backdoor.Makadocs: The Backdoor.Makadocs malware is a trojan targeting Windows\n\n[8 systems that uses Google Docs for C2 communications. Here is a full writeup from](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/malware-targeting-windows-8-uses-google-docs)\nSymantec for more details.\n5. Turla: The Turla group, a well known Russian APT, used a malicious browser\n\nextension which served as a javascript-based backdoor. Within this extension, C2\ninformation is obtained by parsing comments on Brittany Spears’ Instagram posts. This\nis more of a stager than an actual C2, but I thought it would still be interesting to note.\n[Here is a full writeup from ESET for more details.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-hole-campaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/)\n6. MiniDuke: The MiniDuke backdoor parses the posts of a malicious Twitter account to\n\nobtain a URL for its C2 server. Like Turla’s implementation, the MiniDuke malware uses\npublic platforms more for staging than actual C2 communications, however I still\nwanted to note it. [Here is a full writeup from ESET for more details.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-hole-campaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/)\n\nThese are just some of the examples of public platforms being used in real campaigns. The\nfact that legitimate threat actors are continuing to use public platforms as a means of C2\ncommunications is a strong indicator that this threat vector will remain potent for the\nforeseeable future.\n\n## Summary\n\n\n-----\n\nIn summary, P2C2s are a potent C2 family with very obscure and hard to detect\ncommunications. The ability for P2C2s to blend in with other network traffic to a degree much\nhigher than traditional C2s make it a formidable option for threat actors operating in\nenvironments with extensive traffic filtering and analysis. While at this point in time P2C2s\nhave only been seen in a few notable examples, I suspect we will see a continuing increase\nin their development and use, and it is pivotal for defenders and security professionals to\nunderstand the advantages and disadvantages of these C2s, and how to properly defend\nagainst them. Hopefully this writing has helped those efforts in some small way.\n\n## Contact Me\n\n**Twitter:** [@kindredsec](https://twitter.com/kindredsec)\n\n**GitHub:** [itsKindred](https://github.com/itsKindred)\n\n**YouTube:** [Kindred Security](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwTH3RkRCIE35RJ16Nh8V8Q)\n\n\n-----",
