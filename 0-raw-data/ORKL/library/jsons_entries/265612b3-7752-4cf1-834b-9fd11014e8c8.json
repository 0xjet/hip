    "plain_text": "# Russia’s Clandestine Chemical Weapons Programme and the GRU’s Unit 29155\n\n**bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/10/23/russias-clandestine-chemical-weapons-programme-and-the-grus-unit-**\n21955/\n\nOctober 23, 2020\n\nOn October 15, 2020, the European Union imposed sanctions on six senior Russian officials\nand a leading Russian research institute over the alleged use of a nerve agent from the\nNovichok family in the poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Russia dismissed as\nbaseless the EU’s allegations that it had not complied with its obligations, under the\nconvention it ratified in 1997, to discontinue its chemical weapons program. Russian officials\nsaid the country had nothing to do with Navalny’s poisoning and implied that if any party had\nused nerve agents on him, it would have been Western secret services. Vladimir Putin, who\n[in 2017 had personally watched over the destruction of the last remaining Russian chemical](https://youtu.be/Ac9RBmY9Vd0)\n[weapons stash, ridiculed the findings of four separate laboratories, confirmed by the OPCW,](https://ria.ru/20201022/novichok-1581085336.html)\nthat a Novichok-type organophosphate poison was identified in Alexey Navalny’s blood.\n\nTwo years earlier, in 2018, Russia had dismissed as unfounded allegations that its military\nintelligence had used Novichok to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his\ndaughter. Similarly, Russia had then stated that it had no ongoing chemical weapons\nprogram and had destroyed all of its prior arsenals; while alluding that UK agencies may\nhave used their own stash of Novichok to poison the Skripals in a false-flag operation.\n\n[A year-long investigation by Bellingcat and its investigative partners The Insider and Der](https://theins.ru/politika/236238)\n[Spiegel, with contributing investigations from RFE/RL, has discovered evidence that Russia](https://www.svoboda.org/a/30908714.html)\ncontinued its Novichok development program long beyond the officially announced closure\ndate. Data shows that military scientists, who were involved with the original chemical\nweapons program while it was still run by the Ministry of Defense, were dispersed into\nseveral research entities which continued collaborating among one another in a clandestine,\ndistributed R&D program. While some of these institutes were integrated with the Ministry of\nDefense – but camouflaged their work as research into antidotes to organophosphate\npoisoning – other researchers moved to civilian research institutes but may have continued\nworking, under cover of civilian research, on the continued program.\n\nOur investigative team believes the St. Petersburg State Institute for Experimental Military\nMedicine of the Ministry of Defense (“GNII VM”), likely with the assistance of researchers\nfrom the Scientific Center Signal (“SC Signal”), has since 2010 taken the lead role in the\ncontinued R&D and weaponization of the Soviet-era Novichok program.\n\nCrucially for our conclusions, we have identified evidence showing close coordination\nbetween these two institutes and a secretive sub-unit of Military Unit 29155 of Russia’s\nmilitary intelligence, the GRU. This unit has previously been linked to the poisoning attempts\n\n\n-----\n\non Emilian Gebrev in Bulgaria in 2015 as well as Sergey and Yula Skripal in the United\nKingdom in 2018. Telecoms data we obtained shows that the St. Petersurg-based institute\ncommunicated intensively with members of the assassination team during the planning stage\nof the Skripal mission, while also communicating – at highly correlated moments – with\nscientists from SC Signal.\n\nThe two research institutes also appear to collaborate with the 33rd Central Experimental\nInstitute for Scientific Research of the Ministry of Defense, located in the town of Shikhany.\nThis agency was originally involved in researching and testing the Russian chemical\nweapons program.\n\nFurthermore, our research has established that these two institutes were in frequent\ncommunication – including during the planning state of the Skripal operation – with Russia’s\n[Scientific Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology (“GosNIIOHT”), the agency that](https://gosniiokht.ru/)\nwas tasked with supervising the destruction of Russia’s arsenal of nerve agents and\nensuring the termination of the country’s CW program.\n\n\nThe role of the 33 Central Institute and the GosNIIOHT in the development of Russia’srd\nnerve agent program was previously known, and the these two institutes were sanctioned by\nthe European Union. However Neither GNII VM nor SC Signal have been sanctioned by\nEuropean or US governments, and it appears that their work has stayed outside of the focus\nof Western intelligence services.\n\n**Extreme Toxicology at GNII VM**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sprawling complex of The Institute for Experimental Military Medicine outside St. Petersburg. Photo:\n\nThe Insider\n\nGNII VM, the Ministry of Defense’s Institute for Experimental Medicine, is a secretive military\nresearch unit located just outside St. Petersburg. There is scant public information about this\n[establishment’s structure, personnel and projects. A succinct listing of the institute’s history](http://ens.mil.ru/science/SRI/information.htm?id=11895@morfOrgScience)\nand functions on the Defense Ministry’s website suggests that prior to 2015 it had existed as\nan adjunct research center within Russia’s Kirov Military Medical Academy, and had been\nfocused on researching “the ergonomic properties of Russian armaments.” As of May 2015,\nhowever, the institute was given autonomy and a new focus, including “organization of\n_scientific research in the interest of Russia’s defense and national security” and “conducting_\n_tests of the developed products.” An internal 2017 presentation of the institute, obtained by_\nour team, shows that – at least officially – its main functions were developing and testing\nemergency medical equipment, medication, and treatment techniques for wartime use. In\nparticular, the institute reported it was developing an antidote to organophosphate poisoning,\nwith its development being – in 2017 – in a “pre-clinical trial stage”. A rare public lecture\nannouncement from 2018 shows that leading researchers from the institute were specializing\non the effects of [organophosphate poisons on the human body – and were tracking the](http://www.toxicology.ru/docs/nauch/toxicopinion2018.pdf)\ninternational development of antidotes to those. (Poisons from the Novichok group fall into\nthe larger group of organophosphates – which includes also certain pesticides).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe St. Petersburg institute is headed by Sergey Chepur, a 50-year old military doctor and\n[expert in extreme toxicology, with a special interest in the effects of](https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=23340744) organophosphate\npoisons on the human body. There are no open-source photographs of its director Sergey\nChepur, and a rare public mention of his name is contained in a September 2020\n[announcement of an achievement award for his contribution to military medicine.](https://www.ng.ru/news/689972.html)\n\n## Sergey Chepur and Unit 29155’s\n\nAs a research entity serving the Ministry of Defense, the St. Petersburg’s institute has a\nlegitimate and plausible interest in developing antidotes for nerve agents including\norganophosphates. However, telecoms data we obtained shows that key researchers from\nthe institute are integrated with Russia’s military intelligence, including its black-operations\nunit (a clandestine sub-unit of GRU’s Unit 29155) to a degree that cannot be explained away\nby purely defensive considerations. After initially stumbling upon the phone number of the\ninstitute’s chairman, Sergey Chepur, in phone call records of Unit 29155’s commander Maj.\nGeneral Andrey Averyanov, the same number kept popping up in phone records of other\nmembers of the black-ops team, including the main suspects in the poisonings in Bulgaria\nand the UK. This prompted us to obtain Chepur’s own phone records. They showed that he\nhad repeated communication with at least four members of the clandestine team, and that\nthe communications peaked just before undercover international operations undertaken by\n\n\n-----\n\nthe GRU officers. Furthemore, the phone records contained metadata showing that Sergey\nChepur visited the headquarters of the GRU during what appeared to be preparation\nmeetings on the eve of the 2018 Salisbury operation.\n\nIn the period from November 2017 until early March 2018 – when the Skripal poisoning\noperation would have been planned by the GRU – Chepur spoke repeatedly with members\nof Unit 29155. He spoke or texted with the unit’s commander, Andrey Averyanov, at least 65\ntimes (the data about these interactions were purged from Averyanov’s phone records but\nremained visible in Chepur’s phone metadata). In this period he also communicated\nrepeatedly with Maj. Gen. Denis Sergeev, also known under his cover identity of “Sergey\nFedotov”, who supervised both the Gebrev poisoning operation in 2015 and the 2018 Skripal\npoisoning. Chepur also spoke and texted many times with Alexander Mishkin (a.k.a.\n“Alexander Petrov”), one of the two suspects wanted by UK law enforcement over the Skripal\npoisonings, as well as with Col. Alexander Kovalchuk. Both Kovalchuk and Mishkin are part\nof the clandestine-operations GRU team and are medical doctors who graduated from the\nKirov medical military academy in St. Petersburg. Alexander Kovalchuk did not travel to the\nUnited Kingdom during the Salisbury mission, but remained at the GRU headquarters during\nthe three days of the operation which extended into the weekend.\n\nPhone records for 2017 and 2018 show that Sergey Chepur contacted Alexander Mishkin for\nthe first time three months before the Skripal poisoning, on the December 30, 2017. The very\nnext day, Mishkin, traveling under the false identity of “Alexander Petrov,” took a flight from\nRussia to Switzerland, his travel data shows. On the day Mishkin left for Geneva, Col.\nAnatoly Chepiga – a.k.a “Ruslan Boshirov,” the second suspect in the Skripal poisonings –\narrived back from Geneva to Moscow. During the period from Christmas 2017 until the end of\nFebruary 2018, at least five members of unit 29155 traveled to Switzerland on a staggered\nschedule, usually with at least two undercover officers being in the country at any given time.\nThe last member of the team departed from Geneva to Moscow on March 1, 2018, the same\nday on which Sergeeev, Mishkin and Chepiga bought tickets for their flight to London the\nnext day.\n\n[Bellingcat has previously reported on the relevance of Switzerland as a frequently visited](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/02/25/an-officer-and-a-diplomat-the-strange-case-of-the-gru-spy-with-a-red-notice/)\nlocation by unit 29155 and has hypothesized that the Skripal attack may have been prepared\nthere, or that alternatively the GRU may have expected Sergei Skripal to travel to\nSwitzerland during the holiday period. The calls between Chepur and Mishkin in the\nimmediate run-up to the “New Year trips” corroborate our earlier hypothesis. It is unlikely that\nthe relatively small GRU elite team would have had the capacity to work on two separate\noperations in such a small stretch of time.\n\n\n-----\n\nImmediately following Mishkin’s return from Switzerland on January 12, 2018, Sergey\nChepur had several calls with Mishkin and his boss Andrey Averyanov, on January 13, 14,\n17 and 18. A month before the Salisbury operation, on February 2 and 3, 2018, Chepur was\ncontacted for the first time by Denis Sergeev. Serveev, as we [previously reported, oversaw](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/06/28/the-gru-globetrotters-mission-london/)\nthe poisoning mission from a London hotel room, where he kept continuous communication\nwith a burner phone number in Russia. On the evening of February 12, 2018, in the course\nof 17 minutes (from 20:59 to 21:16), Chepur contacted three GRU officers from the\nclandestine unit – Mishkin, Sergeev and Kovalchuk.\n\nOn 18 January, Chepur took a one-day trip to Moscow and spent the day at the GRU\nheadquarters. Metadata from Mishkin, Sergeev and Kovalchuk’s phone show they were at\nthe same location at the same time. The previous day Denis Sergeev had returned from\nGeneva where he had spent a week.\n\nChepur also had a vast number of interactions with the GRU team on the February 23, 2018.\nIn Russia, this date is celebrated as Defender of the Fatherland day and it is customary for\nthe military to send celebratory messages to each other. However, Chepur’s communication\nwith the GRU team members stand out from the rest as they extend late into the evening,\nending with a midnight (23:59) conversation with Alexander Kovalchuk. The number of\ninteractions and the late-night exchanges suggest they were likely linked to the planning of\nthe Skripal operation which was to take place just a week later.\n\nCrucially, on February 27, 2018, just three days before the GRU trio departed for London,\nChepur flew to Moscow on a one-day trip. Upon arrival in Moscow, he communicated with\nseveral GRU officers as well as with members of another research institute, SC Signal.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfterwards, he headed for the headquarters of the GRU where he spent several hours.\nSergeev, Mishkin and Kovalchuk were also present at the GRU headquarters at the same\ntime.\n\nFollowing his three hour stay there, Chepur made two further phone calls to a key researcher\nfrom SC Signal. Chepur then moved to the territory of 27th Military Scientific Center at\nBaumanskaya St. During this visit, which lasted just over an hour, he had several further\ncalls with one of SC Signal’s lead scientists and organophosphates specialists, Victor\nTaranchenko.\n\nOur hypothesis is that during this day – February 27, 2018 – final preparations for the\nupcoming assassination mission in Salisbury were made in Moscow, including for the\ndelivery of the poison and the tools for its applicators, to the GRU black-ops unit.\n\n## SC Signal: From Novichok to Sports Drinks\n\n\nA key part of Russia’s official chemical weapons program prior to its termination was\nconducted by the 33 Central Scientific-Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense. Thisrd\ninstitute, based in the formerly closed military town Shikhany-2 near Saratov, was the R&D\nbase for development of a particularly powerful strand of organophosphate nerve agents\ncommonly referred to as “Novichoks.” Another military institute that had an ancillary role in\nthe development and testing of nerve agents was the 27 Scientific Center (which wasth\nbriefly incorporated into the 33 Center); this institute oversees one of the two Russianrd\nchemical-analytical labs accredited by the OPCW.\n\nIn analyzing Sergey Chepur’s call metadata, we identified a correlation between his calls and\nvisits with GRU’s unit 29155, and calls with several researchers who had formerly worked for\nthe 27th Scientific Center. These included the former chairman of the center – Artur Zhirov,\nas well as his former colleagues Andrey Antokhin and Victor Taranchenko. Chepur spoke\nwith Artur Jirov on 11, 18 and 30 January 2018, on one of the days – the 18 – not long after a\nphone call to Alexander Mishkin. However, the most notable correlation is with Chepur’s\ncommunication with Viktor Taranchenko. Taranchenko was the first person Chepur called\nonce he landed in Moscow on February 27 and just before he headed to the GRU\nheadquarters. Once he was at the GRU and presumably during the planning meeting for the\nupcoming Salisbury operation, the two exchanged several text messages.\n\nWhile still working at the 27th Scientific Center, Taranchenko and his colleague Antokhin had\nspecialized in research of cholinesterase inhibitors, a broad class to which the Novichok and\nother [powerful nerve agents belong. Artur Zhirov, on the other hand, had specialized in](https://www.uspkhim.ru/php/paper_rus.phtml?journal_id=rc&paper_id=4025&year_id=2010&volume=79&issue_id=8&fpage=780&lpage=795)\nresearch of nano-encapsulation: an innovative technique permitting the embedding of\nchemical compounds into a cell-like membrane-covered structure made of other compounds.\nThis technique appeared to be a promising solution to the necessity to delay the onset of the\neffects of certain pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n-----\n\nTaranchenko, like Antokhin and several other key researchers from the 27th Scientific\nCenter, had followed their former boss in 2010 when he left the Center to become the\n[founding CEO of a new scientific research center created through a presidential decree, the](http://government.ru/docs/all/71310/)\ngenerically named Scientific Center “Signal.” SC Signal is incorporated into the structure of\nRussia’s Export Control Agency, and its official function is to ensure technical and scientific\ncontrol over the exports of Russian materials, including “chemicals and technologies that can\n[be used in the manufacturing of chemical weapons”](https://externalzone.portal.customs.gov.ru/storage/document/document_info/2018-02/23/4_3.pdf)\n\nSC Signal and the St. Petersburg experimental-medicine institute work on two publicly\nknown projects, which in theory could explain the interaction between Sergey Chepur and\nthe Signal researchers. However, the correlation between the calls with SC Signal and\nmembers of Unit 29155, as well as a visit by Chepur to one of the addresses of SC Signal on\nJanuary 31, 2018, following which he continued to the GRU headquarters, suggest that the\ncontacts between Chepur and the SC Signal are likely linked to the planning of the Salisbury\noperation.\n\nOne of the labs of SC Signal is located at Natatinskaya 16 in Moscow. The same address houses one of\n\nRussia’s military institutes tasked with the destruction of Russia”s chemical weapons arsenal.\n\nAccording to several experts contacted by our team, the technique of nano-encapsulation –\nwhich appears to be the area of specialization of many of the researchers working at SC\nSignal – may be successfully applied in the application of organophosphate nerve agents\nsuch as the Novichoks. Through this method, experts say, three effects might be achieved\n\n\n-----\n\nthat would improve the efficiency and ease of application of the poison. First, nanoencapsulation could delay the onset of the poison by several hours, which may be desirable\nin clandestine operations. Second, it can improve the rate and speed of absorption through\nthe target’s skin. Third, it can provide an opportunity for masking the presence of the active\ningredients of Novichok, through the (overwhelming) presence in the victim’s body of\nchemical compounds from the cell’s “membrane” – which can be a different, decoy\npoisonous substance. Notably, both in the cases of the poisoning of Emilian Gebrev in 2015,\nand in the case of Navalny, presence of other, non-Novichok – and much less dangerous\npoisons – in the targets’ blood were reported.\n\nWhen approached by our team to comment on the possible link between the SC Signal and\nthe Ministry of Defense’s continued program for development of Novichok, the institute’s\nchairman Artur Zhirov hung up the telephone after hearing the question and without uttering\na word. Reached by telephone and asked about his possible involvement in the development\nof organophosphate poisons, Mr. Taranchenko denied and said he was not even an expert in\norganophosphates – which appears to be contradicted by his body of published research.\n\nConfronted by phone about his frequent interactions with members of GRU’s Unit 29155, Mr.\nSergey Chepur said he had never spoken to any of Alexander Mishkin, Denis Sergeev, or\nAndrey Averyanov. He also appeared to clearly remember that he did not visit the GRU\nheadquarters on February 27, 2018. Before hanging up, he advised us to “stop lying to\neveryone including to yourselves”.\n\n\n-----",
