This is the first time\nour researchers have observed Sphinx campaigns with dedicated configurations targeting\nfinancial institutions in either of the two countries. We believe they are part of ongoing testing\nby Sphinx operators.\n\nSphinx has been keeping low levels of activity since August 2016, when it was detected in\n[attacks on Brazilian banks. The malware authors have been making small, incremental](https://securityintelligence.com/brazil-cant-catch-a-break-after-panda-comes-the-sphinx/)\nupgrades to the code.\n\nThe recent configurations targeting online banking consumers in Canada and Australia are\nused sparingly in what looks like low-volume testing, not full-blown infection campaigns. The\nmalware’s operators appear to be looking very carefully to determine which geographies\noffer the paths of least resistance.\n\n## Zeus Sphinx Targets Banks in Canada and Australia\n\nIn Canada, Sphinx’s operators included URLs for over 33 financial institutes. They focused\ntheir target list on credit unions, likely seeing them as the lower hanging fruit in the Canadian\nfinancial sector. The malware’s targets are consumer accounts.\n\n_Figure 1: Sphinx’s Canadian target distribution per entity type (Source: IBM X-Force)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Canada-focused Sphinx operators are most likely familiar with the cybercrime arena.\nAccording to our research team, they used the same attack servers that facilitated the Zeus\nCitadel and Ramnit attacks in early 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The\nwebinjections share familiar code patterns with other banking Trojans, indicating that the\n[attackers likely bought them from an injection-writing service.](https://securityintelligence.com/dark-web-suppliers-and-organized-cybercrime-gigs/)\n\n## Familiar Tricks\n\nIn their recent campaigns, Sphinx’s operators have been using two distribution methods to\nspread the malware to new victims: email messages containing malicious Word documents\n[that launch a visual basic for applications (VBA) loader and malvertising schemes designed](https://securityintelligence.com/malvertising-coming-website-near/)\n[to spread the Sundown exploit kit (EK).](https://www.securityweek.com/sundown-exploit-kit-starts-using-steganography)\n\nThe use of the Sundown EK provides further evidence that Sphinx’s operators may be linked\nto other commercial malware operators. Sundown has been evolving since the fourth quarter\nof 2016, from a relatively small, second-tier kit into one of the most prominent EKs in\ncirculation. It includes older exploits for Internet Explorer, Flash and Silverlight. It has been\npreviously connected with other banking Trojans such as Kronos and with previous malware\ncampaigns in Canada.\n\nIn Australia, the configuration targets a mix of 40 major banks, credit unions and payment\nproviders. That configuration also targets some banks based in the U.S.\n\n_Figure 2: Sphinx’s Australia-focused target distribution per geo (Source: IBM X-Force)_\n\nIBM X-Force research reported past Sphinx campaigns launched against Brazilian banks in\n[2015 and U.K. banks in 2016.](https://securityintelligence.com/uk-banks-hit-with-new-zeus-sphinx-variant-and-renewed-kronos-banking-trojan-attacks/)\n\n## Financial Malware: A Global Perspective\n\nFrom a global perspective, Sphinx is counted as part of the overall Zeus family of Trojans,\n[since it is almost entirely based on the leaked Zeus v2.0.8.9 source code.](https://threatpost.com/zeus-source-code-leaked-051011/75217/)\n\n[With multiple Zeus variations such as Panda, Sphinx and](https://securityintelligence.com/panda-is-one-hungry-bear-a-heavyweight-banking-trojan-rolls-into-brazil/) [Floki Bot active in the wild, Zeus’s](https://securityintelligence.com/news/floki-bot-funny-name-financial-nightmare/)\ncodebase maintains the top position as the most active banking Trojan family. Different\nvariants are operated by numerous cybercrime factions worldwide.\n\n_Figure 3: Most prevalent financial malware families 2017 YTD (Source: IBM X-Force)_\n\n## Relevant IoCs\n\n\n-----\n\nIBM X-Force shares Zeus Sphinx indicators of compromise (IoCs) on IBM X-Force\nExchange.
