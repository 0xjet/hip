The National Cybersecurity\nand Communications Integration Center\n(NCCIC) provides critical national\ncapabilities. The NCCIC’s primary focus\nareas include conducting daily analysis\nand situational awareness, incident\nmanagement, and information sharing in\nthe cybersecurity and communications domains.\n\nThe NCCIC organization supports a holistic approach at home\nand abroad to prevention, protection, mitigation, response,\nand recovery efforts. The NCCIC is a 24/7 Communications\nOperations and Integration Center.\n\nNCCIC partners include all federal departments and agencies;\nstate, local, tribal, and territorial governments; the private sector;\nand international entities.\n\nIn 2013, the NCCIC as a whole received over 220,000 reports\nof cybersecurity and communications incidents. These reports\noriginated from both public and private partners sharing what\nthey discovered on their information technology systems. The\noutreach facilitated gaining insights on the latest prevention and\nmitigation measures from the broader national cybersecurity\ncommunity. In the coming years, an even greater number of cyber\nincidents are likely with a renewed need to solve cybersecurity\nand communications-related challenges as expeditiously as\npossible.\n\nI am proud of the hard work and dedication illustrated by the\nNCCIC team.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLarry Zelvin, Director\nNational Cybersecurity and Communications\nIntegration Center (NCCIC)\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\n\n###### Welcome ICS-CERT\n\nThis year, the Industrial Control\nSystems Cyber Emergency Response\nTeam (ICS-CERT) briefed asset owners\nand developed tools and capabilities to\nenhance cybersecurity incident handling\nand response efforts.\n\nICS-CERT correlated emerging cyber\nincidents with previous events and\ntracked known threat actors based on\ntheir techniques and tactics. The information these tools and\ncapabilities yielded was leveraged to provide situational awareness\ninformation to federal law enforcement agencies and the greater\nindustrial control system community.\n\nICS-CERT initiatives accomplished in 2013 included:\n\n  - Providing briefings, including classified briefings, on\n\nindustrial control systems threats and defense-in-depth to\ncritical infrastructure owners, operators, and vendors as well\nas other industry and government partners.\n\n - Hosting meetings and presenting event information and\n\nmitigations across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors.\n\n - Triaging over 250 cybersecurity incidents by providing\n\nanalytic support and guidance to asset owners.\n\n  - Delivering expert guidance and consultation to asset\n\nowners and operators on the self-assessment Cyber Security\nEvaluation Tool (CSET®) or Architecture Reviews.\n\n - Engaging in one Industrial Control System Joint Working\n\nGroup meeting bringing together the industrial control\nsystem community to share its best cybersecurity practices,\ncreate new relationships, and leverage knowledge from\nICS-CERT.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarty Edwards, Director\nIndustrial Control Systems Cyber\nEmergency Response Team\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nICSJWG GCC Chair\n\n\n-----\n\n###### National Preparedness\n\nThe economic welfare and safety of the American people\nrelies on the resilience and reliability of the Nation’s\ncritical infrastructure. The National Cybersecurity and\nCommunications Integration Center/Industrial Control\nSystems Cyber Emergency Response Team (NCCIC/\nICS-CERT) provides a variety of operational capabilities to\nensure that critical infrastructure across the nation continues\nto operate as designed and is well secured. These efforts\nrequire continual vigilance and innovative responses to\naddress emerging challenges at a global level. ICS-CERT\nbrings together a community of critical infrastructure\nstakeholders who work together to improve our national\ncybersecurity posture and address future needs.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) applies\nguidance from Presidential Policy Directive 8: National\nPreparedness to enable operational programs like ICS-CERT\nto align key roles and responsibilities in its national\ncybersecurity response and mitigation efforts.\n\nThe critical principles establish a fundamental doctrine\nfor ICS-CERT response capabilities that include: engaged\n\n\npartnership; tiered response; scalable, flexible, and adaptable\noperational capabilities; unity of effort through unified\ncommand; and readiness to act.\n\nICS-CERT employs an adaptable and repeatable process\nto ensure that ICS-CERT vendors, operators, and owners\nacross the country can organize response efforts to address\na variety of cybersecurity risks based on their unique needs\nand capabilities. This framework is not based on a one-sizefits-all organizational construct. Instead, it acknowledges\nthe concept of tiered response, which emphasizes that\nresponse to cybersecurity incidents, and should be handled\nat the right level to support the critical infrastructure sector\nowner, operator, or vendor.\n\nICS-CERT operations in this brochure are described by the\nattributes that support its scalable, flexible, and adaptable\ncoordinating structures. The program has roles and\nresponsibilities which include integrating capabilities across\nthe whole community, local, state, tribal, territorial, and\nfederal governments in support of response to actual and\npotential cybersecurity incidents.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### National Preparedness\n\n\nI. \u0007Prevention – Engaged Partnership\n\n\n### WHAT\n\n\nThe capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or\nstop a threatened or actual act or terrorism\n\n\n###### HOW\n\n\nIndustrial Control\nSystems Joint\nWorking Group\n\n\nOutreach\n\n\nII.

Prevention in this context relies on an engaged\npartnership with the industrial control system community\nof owners, operators, and vendors.\n\nDHS ICS-CERT, in coordination with the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation (FBI), Department of Energy, the\nElectricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center,\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA), and the Oil\nand Natural Gas and Pipelines Sector Coordinating Councils’\nCybersecurity Working Group, conducted a series of Action\nCampaign Briefings throughout Fiscal Year 2013 in response\nto the growing number of cyber incidents related to U.S.\ncritical infrastructure. The 14 briefings were given to over\n750 attendees in various cities throughout the country to\nassist asset owners and operators in detecting intrusions\nand developing mitigation strategies. Briefings were held\nat both the classified and unclassified levels, and covered a\nwide range of topics. This included the latest threats against\nindustrial control systems, adversary tactics, lessons learned\n\n\nfrom current activities, best practices for detecting and\npreventing intrusion, and methods for securing networks.\n\nImportant sector-specific briefings:\n\n  - The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers\n\n(AFPM) Quality and Assurance and Technology Forum/\nAFPM Plant Automation and Decision Support Conference,\n\n - Nuclear Sector Joint Cyber Subcouncil - Sponsored by\n\nNuclear Energy Institute,\n\n - 7th Annual American Petroleum Institute Cybersecurity\n\nConference for the Oil & Natural Gas Industry,\n\n - Chemical Classified Briefing for Chief Information\n\nOfficers,\n\n - Nuclear Fuel Cycle Facility Conference,\n\n - 2013 Chemical Sector Security Summit, and\n\n - Cybersecurity for Oil and Natural Gas Forum.\n\nThis level of engagement supports the continuous development of resources to help industry understand and prepare\nfor ongoing and emerging control systems cybersecurity\nissues, vulnerabilities, mitigation, and recovery strategies.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group 2013\nFall Meeting took place in Rockville, Maryland, at the\nInstitute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research/National\nI i f S d d dT h l (NIST) f ili\n\n\nnew technology to replace firewalls and the way ahead\nfor the Department of Defense as it relates to industrial\ncontrol systems cybersecurity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Protection\n\nTiered Protection Through Cybersecurity Training\n\nICS-CERT aligns training to further develop the skills\nnecessary to secure and protect critical infrastructure\nfrom cyber threats. ICS-CERT offers cybersecurity training\nat no cost to industrial control system professionals and\nmanagers across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors in\norder to transfer knowledge on securing and protecting\ninfrastructure to reduce cyber risk. These training courses\ninclude Introduction to Control Systems Cybersecurity,\nIntermediate Cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems,\nand Industrial Control Systems Advanced Cybersecurity.\nIn 2013, nearly 700 infrastructure professionals and\nlaw enforcement agents were trained. ICS-CERT training\nprograms offer a foundation for cybersecurity professionals\nto attain the necessary skills to approach cybersecurity\nchallenges.\n\n\n2013 Training Highlights included the following:\n\n - Provided 11 Advanced Training Sessions to 442\n\nparticipants, which are week-long events that provide\nintensive hands-on training and a 12-hour, red team/\nblue team exercise that simulates a corporate espionage\nscenario.\n\n - Trained law enforcement professional in Control\n\nSystems Forensics for Law Enforcement course. This\ncourse educates law enforcement agents on performing\nforensics on industrial control systems versus normal\ncorporate enterprise network forensics.\n\n - Delivered five training sessions across the country,\n\nincluding Introduction to Control Systems\nCybersecurity (101), Intermediate Cybersecurity\nfor Industrial Control Systems lecture (201), and\nIntermediate Cybersecurity for Industrial Control\nSystems with lab (202).\n\n - Conducted our first regional trainings.\n\n - Supported international training courses that reached\n\n65 students from around the world.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Protection\n\nTiered Support with the CSET\n\nThe ICS-CERT foundation tool to baseline cybersecurity\nrelative to cybersecurity standards is our Cyber Security\nEvaluation Tool (CSET). In 2013, over 5,000 CSETs were\ndistributed and downloaded. As a significant piece of the\nICS-CERT proactive portfolio, CSET continues to support,\neducate, and guide critical infrastructure asset owners. By\ncombining the use of recognized standards and a step-bystep wizard style, CSET has become an accepted practice for\ncritical infrastructure asset owners in establishing their own\ncybersecurity baselines and processes.\n\nCSET educates asset owners through an assessment process.\nDuring this process, cybersecurity implementers and\nmanagement personnel are taken step by step through\na series of concepts and ideas. While considering each\nconcept, the assessment team reviews its individual\nprocesses from a cybersecurity perspective. The team\ndiscovers its own unique vulnerabilities while being\nintroduced to new concepts and principles of cybersecurity.\n\nTo accommodate more mature cybersecurity processes,\nCSET now provides the capability for current CSET users\nto use their past and current assessments to evaluate their\ninvestment in an established cybersecurity process. The\n\n\nassessment and then incorporate following assessments\nto trend and compare overall improvement. Users will be\nable to drill down into specific areas to view trending in\nareas such as account management, password-management,\ndefense-in-depth, or least user privileges. Users can use\nthis information to justify spending on particular areas of\nvulnerability, prioritize work and investment, and determine\nreturn on investment for cybersecurity-related spending.\n\nNew functionality CSET 6.0 includes:\n\n - Video tutorials available on demand from YouTube.\n\n - Component questions reflect the latest concerns and\n\nissues in control system-related cybersecurity.\n\n - High-level concept questions help the user to better\n\nunderstand and navigate questions.\n\n - Ability to assign different portions and sections of an\n\nassessment and then merge all the pieces back together\nto create a single assessment.\n\n - Capability to combine assessments to compare\n\ncybersecurity between divisions, find common\nproblems, or illustrate the distinctive needs for each\ndepartment.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mitigation\n\nIncident Response relies on a Scalable, Flexible,\nand Adaptable Operational Capabilities\n\nICS-CERT operations rely on an adaptable and repeatable\napproach to mitigate cyber attacks. The repeatable process\ndelivers core cybersecurity capabilities to industrial\ncontrol system owners, operators, and vendors. The\nnumber, type, and mitigation resources ICS-CERT is able\nto provide are directly proportional to the requirement of\nthe cybersecurity incident. As needs of an incident escalate\nand change, the program remains scalable, flexible, and\nadaptable in their incident response.\n\nICS-CERT’s suite of mobilized capabilities is associated\nwith those actions that may protect property and the\nenvironment, stabilize communities and support basic\nhuman needs after a significant cybersecurity incident.\n\nICS-CERT works with critical infrastructure asset owners\nand operators to respond to cyber incidents that have the\npotential to impact any of the 16 critical infrastructure\nsectors. ICS-CERT works with the potentially affected\norganizations to offer mitigations and subject matter\nexpertise for immediate actions. The mitigations are specific\nto the cyber threat and needs of the organizations.\n\n\nIn 2013, ICS-CERT applied capabilities to a number\nof cyber incidents, coordinated researcher discovered\nindustrial control system vulnerabilities with vendors, and\nproduced alerts and advisories to notify the ICS community.\nThese situational awareness products provide actionable\ninformation about mitigation and protection strategies for\nimplementing sound security practices.\n\nThis year, ICS-CERT received and responded to 257\nincidents as voluntarily reported by asset owners and\nindustry partners. In 2013, attacks against the Energy sector\nrepresented over 56 percent of all incidents reported to\nICS-CERT. The scope of incidents encompassed a vast range\nof threats and observed methods for attempting to gain\naccess to both business and control systems infrastructure,\nincluding:\n\n - Unauthorized access and exploitation of Internetfacing ICS/SCADA devices\n\n - Malware infections within air-gapped control system\n\nnetworks (impacting operations)\n\n - SQL Injection and application vulnerability\n\nexploitation\n\n\n-----\n\n - Lateral movement between network zones\n\n - Targeted spear phishing campaigns\n\n - Watering hole attacks (one of which utilized a zero-day\n\nvulnerability)\n\n###### Mitigation\n\nPreparation Focuses Scalable, Flexible, and Adaptable\nApproach to Incident and Vulnerability Analysis\n\nICS-CERT employs analysis to improve the security\nposture and identify cybersecurity mitigation measures\nfor industrial control systems. Vulnerability coordination,\nincident response, and mitigation services provided by\nICS-CERT rely on advanced analysis provided through our\nAdvanced Analytical Laboratory. The program cultivates\nskills, tools, and personnel to meet the demands of\ntraditional industrial control systems security and today’s\nthreat landscape and evolving exploitation techniques.\n\nThe Advanced Analytical Laboratory conducted\nvulnerability analysis and provided feedback and guidance\nto the ICS-CERT Vulnerability Team. The ICS-CERT\n\n_In FY-13, ICS-CERT’s Advanced Analytical Laboratory analyzed data from_\n_73 incidents. Phishing or spear-phishing attacks comprised_\n_21 of the 73. Data from 11 incidents were related to intrusion_\n_attempts by an emerging cyber threat actor as part of a larger_\n_campaign involving more victims._\n\n\nprepared alerts and advisories using the vulnerability\ninformation and working closely with the industrial\ncontrol system vendor. These alerts and advisories are\nposted to the US-CERT secure portal and on the public\nWeb site. In total, the ICS-CERT Vulnerability Team\nreceived 187 reports from researchers and vendors\nthat required coordination, testing, analysis, and the\npublication of information products.\n\nThis year, the Advanced Analytical Laboratory focused\non improving ICS-CERT’s incident response capabilities\nand tools to include rapid, enterprise scanning of\nsystems to look for known indicators of compromise for\nsophisticated intrusions. At the request of asset owners,\nthese new capabilities as well as traditional incident\nresponse techniques were deployed for seven onsite\nincident response activations.\n\nThe Advanced Analytical Laboratory also made significant\nimprovements in its ability to handle and process\ndigital media. Advanced Analytical Laboratory developed\nadditional automation tools and techniques that have\nshortened the turn-around time and increased the\nthoroughness of the analysis.\n\n\n## 11\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Response \n\nNCCIC Provides Unified Response\n\nDHS provides analysis and support through the Office of\nCybersecurity & Communications, within the National\nProtection and Programs Directorate, to an advanced\nnetwork of cybersecurity professionals who work to protect\ncritical infrastructure from cybersecurity threats.\n\nThe NCCIC, within the Office of Cybersecurity and\nCommunications, serves as a centralized location where\noperational elements involved in cybersecurity for\ncritical infrastructure are coordinated and integrated with\nICS-CERT.\n\nThe NCCIC is composed of four branches:\n\nUnited States Computer Emergency Readiness Team\n(US-CERT) employs analysis techniques and expertise to\naddress malicious cyber activity targeting our nation’s\nnetworks. US-CERT develops and deploys timely and\nactionable information to federal departments and agencies,\nstate and local governments, private sector organizations,\nand over 200 international partners. US-CERT operates the\nNational Cybersecurity Protection System, providing federal\ndepartments and agencies with intrusion detection and\nprevention capabilities.\n\n\nICS-CERT strengthens control systems cybersecurity\nthrough public-private partnerships. ICS-CERT has four\nfocus areas: 1) situational awareness for stakeholders, 2)\ncontrol systems incident response and technical analysis,\n3) control systems vulnerability coordination, and 4)\nstrengthening cybersecurity partnerships with government\ndepartments and agencies.\n\nNational Coordinating Center (NCC) for Telecommunications leads and coordinates the initiation, restoration, and\nreconstitution of telecommunications services or facilities\nunder all conditions. The NCC leverages partnerships with\ngovernment, industry, and international partners to obtain\nsituational awareness and determine priorities for protection\nand response.\n\nNCCIC Operations and Integration engages in planning,\ncoordination, and integration capabilities to synchronize\nanalysis, information sharing, and incident response efforts\nacross all NCCIC branches and activities. This includes\ncoordinating the continuity of operations responsibilities\nfor alternate site operations to support minimal disruption\nto NCCIC mission essential functions. It acts as a 24-hour\nclearinghouse for critical cyber and communications\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation and tracks and initiates critical information\nrequirements that guide the dissemination of critical\ninformation.\n\nThe NCCIC operational activities include providing greater\nunderstanding of cybersecurity and communications\nsituation awareness vulnerabilities, intrusions, incidents,\nmitigation, and recovery actions. As the incident stabilizes,\neach organizational response effort is able to support the\ntransition from response to recovery.\n\nAs mutually supporting, fully integrated elements of the\nNCCIC, these branches provide the authorities, capabilities,\nand partnerships necessary to lead a national approach to\naddressing cybersecurity and communications issues at the\noperational level.\n\nThe NCCIC organization works closely with those federal\ndepartments and agencies most responsible for securing\nthe government’s cyber and communications systems\nand actively engages with private sector companies and\ninstitutions; state, local, tribal, and territorial governments;\nand international counterparts. Each group of stakeholders\nrepresents a community of practice, working together to\nprotect the portions of critical information technology with\nwhich they own, operate, manage, or interact.\n\n\n###### Response\n\nUnity of Effort Through Unified Command\nSupported with ICS-CEA\n\nThe Industrial Control Systems Consequence Effects and\nAnalysis (ICS-CEA) framework is a collaboration tool.\nICS-CEA provides a critical infrastructure modeling and\nsimulation capability. The tool also provides a means for\nusers to model, analyze, and share information related to\npotential consequences of naturally occurring or man-made\nthreats on our Nation’s critical infrastructure. The ICS-CEA\nsystem provides the NCCIC a capability for daily use of\nmodeling, simulation, analysis, and information sharing\nrelated to potential cross-sector “consequence” effects to\nseveral critical infrastructures and their related sectors.\n\nIn 2013, ICS-CEA has been used for responding to multiple\nrequests by the NCCIC regarding the identification of\npotentially affected critical infrastructure sectors because of\nnatural and potential man-made threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Recovery\n\nICS-CERT Applies Advanced Capabilities to Support\nRecovery\n\nICS-CERT works with critical infrastructure asset owners\nand operators to respond to cyber incidents that impact any\nof the 16 critical infrastructure sectors. ICS-CERT supports\nrecovery of the affected organization by providing adequate\ninterim and long-term solutions and subject matter\nexpertise for immediate actions. The response and recovery\nare specific to the incident and needs of the organizations.\n\nICS-CERT provides cybersecurity evaluations to support the\nreliability and resiliency of the systems that comprise and\ninterconnect critical infrastructures. ICS-CERT develops and\nimplements coordinated security measures in collaboration\nwith partners from across public, private, and international\ncommunities.\n\nIn 2013, ICS-CERT conducted 72 onsite assessments across\nthe US critical infrastructure sectors. The objective of the\nassessment is to establish a “baseline of performance” with\n\n\nregard to cybersecurity maturity as defined within a suite of\ncybersecurity standards and guidelines. Although the results\nmay differ from sector to sector, many of the vulnerabilities\nand weaknesses within the networks and systems are\nsimilar. This year has seen increased partnering with the\ncommercial nuclear industry and the energy sector with\nregard to performing onsite cybersecurity assessments.\n\nCybersecurity assessments and recovery plans are tailored\nto each individual organization depending on the level of\ncomplexity in the systems. Asset owners can now request\nCSET evaluations and/or Architecture Reviews, which is a\nmore in-depth comprehensive evaluation of specific control\nsystems networks, architectures, and components, to\nsupport system analysis and future recovery actions.\n\nICS-CERT will continue to support the development of\ntools and techniques available to ICS community members\naffected by cyber incidents.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Future\n\nICS-CERT will advance and ensure the resilience and reliability\nof the Nation’s critical infrastructure and protect key resources.\nICS-CERT’s mission is essential to the economic welfare and\nsafety of the American people.\n\nICS-CERT will engage and work with critical infrastructure\nvendors, operators, and asset owners across the country to\nenable response efforts to address a variety of cybersecurity\nrisks. A computer based training course is being developed\nto engage a larger number vendor owner and operators. This\ntraining will allow the program to reach more critical infrastructure professionals across the country. The program will\nfurther enable a framework that acknowledges the concept of\ntiered response, which emphasizes enabling the best possible\nsupport to meet the unique challenges of each critical infrastructure sector.\n\nICS-CERT is committed to supporting a community of critical\ninfrastructure stakeholders to address future needs and\ncontinue to improve cybersecurity capabilities. The Industrial\nControl System Joint Working Group (ICSJWG) will support\nmembership groups to align activities and more effectively\nemploy member expertise. Going forward, the governing\nbody of ICSJWG will focus on development of working group\n\n\nmeetings, webinars, product review and approval, socialization\nand marketing of deliverables. This approach will deliver on a\nflexible and resilient approach to partner engagement, as well\nas provide a substantial platform for the public and private\nsectors to collaborate on the cybersecurity of the critical\ninfrastructure in FY-14.\n\nThe program will continue to support: engaged partnership;\ntiered response; scalable, flexible, and adaptable operational\ncapabilities; unity of effort through unified command; and readiness to actively engage the public and private sectors, as well\nas international partners to prepare for, prevent, and respond\nto cybersecurity incidents that could impair strategic assets.\nThe rollout of CSET 6.0 will provide an unprecedented level of\norganizational interaction with the tool to baseline and track\ncybersecurity. ICS-CERT continually improves the program’s\nresources to enhance the security, resiliency, and reliability of\nthe Nation’s cyber and communications infrastructure.\n\nIn order to provide integrated capabilities, ICS-CERT enhances\nall aspect of preparedness and capabilities based on the specific\nneeds and requirements of the requesting customer. This\ntailored approach provides scalable response to cybersecurity\nchallenges across critical infrastructures.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Critical Infrastructure Sectors\n\nChemical Emergency Services Information Technology\nCommercial Facilities Energy Nuclear Reactors, Materials,\nCommunications Financial Services and Waste\nCritical Manufacturing Food and Agriculture Transportation Systems\nDams Government Facilities Water and Wastewater\nDefense Industrial Base Healthcare and Public Health Systems\n\n###### ICS-CERT Responses\n\nEmergency Services 1\nDams 1\n\nCritical Manufacturing 38, 15%\n\nCommunications 10, 4%\n\nCommercial Facilities 4, 2%\n\n_This chart illustrates the number_\n_of ICS-CERT responses to sector_ Water 13, 5%\n_specific cybersecurity threat across_\n_the critical infrastructure sec-_\n\nTransportation 12, 5%\n\n_tors.
