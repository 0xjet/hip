This is a new actor operating since July 2021. Prior to this ransomware, Tortilla has been\nexperimenting with other payloads, such as the PowerShell-based netcat clone Powercat, which is known to\nprovide attackers with unauthorized access to Windows machines.\n[We assess with moderate confidence that the initial infection vector is exploitation of ProxyShell](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/8/17/from-pwn2own-2021-a-new-attack-surface-on-microsoft-exchange-proxyshell)\n[vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server through the deployment of China Chopper web shell.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/08/china-chopper-still-active-9-years-later.html)\n\n## What's new?\n\nCisco Talos discovered a malicious campaign using Cisco Secure product telemetry on Oct. 12, 2021 targeting\nvulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers and attempting to exploit the ProxyShell vulnerability to deploy the Babuk\nransomware in the victim's environment. The actor is using a somewhat unusual infection chain technique where\nan intermediate unpacking module is hosted on a pastebin.com clone pastebin.pl. The intermediate unpacking\nstage is downloaded and decoded in memory before the final payload embedded within the original sample is\ndecrypted and executed.\n\n## How did it work?\n\nInfection typically starts with a downloader module on a victim's server. We have observed downloaders in a\nstandalone executable format and in a DLL format. The DLL downloader is run by the parent process w3wp.exe,\nwhich is the Exchange IIS worker process.\n\n[The initial downloader is a modified EfsPotato exploit to target proxyshell and PetitPotam vulnerabilities. The](https://github.com/zcgonvh/EfsPotato)\ndownloader runs an embedded obfuscated PowerShell command to connect and download a packed downloader\nmodule from the actor's infrastructure. The PowerShell command also executes an AMSI bypass to circumvent\nendpoint protection. The download server is hosted using the malicious domains fbi[.]fund and xxxs[.]info.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial packed loader module contains encrypted .NET resources as bitmap images. The decrypted content is\nthe actual Babuk ransomware payload. To decrypt and unpack the payload, the loader connects to a URL on\npastebin.pl containing the intermediate unpacker module. The unpacker module decrypts the embedded Babuk\nransomware payload in memory and injects it into a newly created process AddInProcess32.\n\nThe Babuk ransomware module, running within the process AddInProcess32, enumerates the processes running\non the victim's server and attempts to disable a number of processes related to backup products, such as Veeam\nbackup service. It also deletes volume shadow service (VSS) snapshots from the server using vssadmin utility to\nmake sure the encrypted files cannot be restored from their VSS copies. The ransomware module encrypts the\nfiles in the victim's server and appends a file extension .babyk to the encrypted files. The actor demands the victim\npay $10,000 USD to obtain the decryption key to regain their files.\n\n## So what?\n\nBabuk is a ransomware that can be compiled for several hardware and software platforms. The compilation is\nconfigured through a ransomware builder. Windows and ARM for Linux are the most used compiled versions, but\nESX and a 32-bit, old PE executable were observed over time. However, in this particular campaign, we found\nevidence of actors specifically targeting Windows.\n\nBabuk ransomware is nefarious by its nature and while it encrypts the victim's machine, it interrupts the system\n[backup process and deletes the volume shadow copies. In early September 2021, Babuk source code and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomwares-full-source-code-leaked-on-hacker-forum/) a\nbinary builder were leaked, which may have encouraged new malicious actors to manipulate and deploy the\nmalware. Recently, a [Babuk decryptor has been released. Unfortunately, it is only effective on files encrypted with a](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomware-decryptor-released-to-recover-files-for-free/)\nnumber of leaked keys and cannot be used to decrypt files encrypted by the variant described in this blog post.\n\nOrganizations should regularly update their servers and applications with the latest available patches from the\nvendors eliminating the vulnerabilities in their environment. Defenders should be constantly looking for suspicious\nevents generated by detection systems for an abrupt service termination, abnormally high I/O rates for drives\nattached to their servers, the deletion of shadow copies or system configuration changes.\n\n## Infection chain summary\n\nCisco Talos discovered a malicious campaign that used either a DLL or .NET executable. One of the two types of\nfiles starts the infection chain on the targeted system. The initial .NET executable module runs as a child process\nof w3wp.exe and invokes the command shell to run an obfuscated PowerShell command.\n\nThe PowerShell command invokes a web request and downloads the payload loader module using certutil.exe\nfrom a URL hosted on the domains fbi[.]fund and xxxs[.]info, or the IP address 185[.]219[.]52[.]229.\n\nThe payload loader downloads an intermediate unpacking stage from the PasteBin clone site pastebin.pl. The\nunpacker concatenates the bitmap images embedded in the resource section of the trojan and decrypts the\npayload into the memory. The payload is injected into the process AddInProcess32 and is used to encrypt files on\nthe victim's server and all mounted drives.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Infection flow-chart._\n\n## Stage 1: Downloaders\n\nWe've observed the initial executable or DLL targeting servers that use Intel and AMD architecture. Usually, if an\nexecutable has w3wp (the IIS worker process in Exchange) as the parent process, this means the attacker has\n[exploited a ProxyShell vulnerability. The observed infected systems also had the China Chopper web shell](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34473%2520https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34523%2520https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31207)\ninstalled. We believe China Chopper eventually ran the initial download command.\n\nOur telemetry also indicates that the actor's infrastructure was active in attempting to exploit a number of\nvulnerabilities in other products most commonly triggering the following Snort rules:\n\n[Microsoft Exchange autodiscover server side request forgery attempt (57907)](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-57907)\n[Atlassian Confluence OGNL injection remote code execution attempt (58094)](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-58094)\n[Apache Struts remote code execution attempt (39190,](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-39190) [39191)](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-39191)\n[WordPress wp-config.php access via directory traversal attempt (41420)](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-41420)\n[SolarWinds Orion authentication bypass attempt (56916)](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-56916)\n[Oracle WebLogic Server remote command execution attempt (50020)](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-50020)\n[Liferay arbitrary Java object deserialization attempt (56800)](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-56800)\n\nDLL\n\nWe observed that the parent process w3wp.exe an IIS worker process that runs the .NET applications launches\nthe downloader DLL.. The DLL is a mixed mode assembly, whose functionality is included in the native entry point\nof the library DllMainCRTStartup. The DllMainCRTStartup function calls the command shell to run an encoded\nPowerShell command to download the next stage's loader from hxxp://fbi[.]fund/dark.exe, which is the main packed\nmodule containing the final payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_DllMainCRTStartup calls the function to download the next stage._\n\n.NET executable downloader module\n\n[The .NET executable version of the initial downloader is a slightly modified variant of the EfsPotato exploit with](https://github.com/zcgonvh/EfsPotato)\ncode to download and run the next stage. EfsPotato is an exploit that attempts to escalate the process privileges\n[using a vulnerability in the Encrypted File System (CVE-2021-36942).](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name%3DCVE-2021-36942)\n\nThe PowerShell command invokes a web request to connect to the malicious repository hxxp://fbi[.]fund/tortillas/\nusing the Invoke-WebRequest commandlet and certutil.exe to download the main loader module and save it as\ntortilla.exe. Finally, the downloader runs tortilla.exe.\n\n_Modified EfsPotato exploit._\n\n_Decoded PowerShell command._\n\nThe exploit enumerates the current user privileges and access the user token and modifies the token access level\nto MaximumAllowed thereby enhances the privileges and calls CreateProcessAsUser function to run the stage 2\nloader as a new process within the security context specified in the token of the victim's user account.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actor executes an AMSI bypass and disables the Windows Defender real time monitoring, script scanning and\nbehavior monitoring by executing the commandlet Set-MpPreference.\n\nThe Stage 1 downloaders associated with this campaign are signed with the same digital signature, the validity of\nwhich we cannot verify. The thumbprint of the signature is:21D354A27519DD62B328416BAB01767DA94786CB.\nThe same certificate is used by the actor to sign samples from previous campaigns executed from July 2021.\n\n## Stage 2: Main module loader\n\nThe second stage, the main ransomware loader contains the final payload. It's a 32-bin .NET executable\nmasquerading as a legitimate stock management system (SMS) application not to be confused with the SMS\nmessaging protocol. The module is packed with ConfuserEx, a free, open-source protector for .NET applications.\nThis stage is downloaded by a process launched by the Exchange IIS worker process.\n\nThe application contains the final payload in an encrypted format, split between the .NET resources.\n\nIt attempts to connect to the URL [https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/a57be2ca and download the intermediate module](https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/a57be2ca)\nrequired for unpacking the final payload.\n\nThe URL is passed as an argument to the decrypting function which downloads the data stream from PasteBin and\ndecrypts the data stream in memory to generate the intermediate unpacking module.\n\n## Stage 3: Intermediate unpacker\n\nThe intermediate unpacker is a DLL, whose binary is stored as an encoded text in PasteBin. The library is\nassociated with the classes that check the existence of sandboxes and virtual machine environments by\nenumerating their services to identify if it is running in a virtualized environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Virtual environments check._\n\nThe DLL contains several arrays with ASCII characters whose values such as the folder path and the directory\nlocations are decrypted using the Rijndael algorithm.\n\n_Decryption function for the data (decrypts resource bitmaps)._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe unpacker creates a copy of the legitimate file AddInProcess32.exe in the user s temporary folder\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp and launches the process in suspended mode. Microsoft has\nrecommended this application to be blocklisted as it can be used to bypass Windows Defender application control.\n\nThe intermediate unpacking module accesses the resources of stage 2 downloader, parses the stream of binary\ndata embedded in the bitmap files into memory and based on the packer configuration injects the decrypted\nmodule into the virtual memory of the previously launched AddInProcess32.exe. The unpacked module in the\nmemory is the Babuk ransomware payload.\n\nThe packer has the ability to inject the payload, based on its configuration into one of the following processes:\n\nAppLaunch.exe\nsvchost.exe\nRegAsm.exe\nInstallUtil.exe\nmscorsvw.exe\nAddInProcess32.exe\n\nTo hide the fact that the module is downloaded from the internet, the unpacker deletes the zone identifier alternate\ndata stream of the main loader.\n\n_Zone identifier is deleted._\n\n## Stage 4: Babuk ransomware payload\n\nThe Stage 2 loader creates a copy of the file AddinProcess32.exe in the user's temporary directory and invokes the\nprocess. The unpacked Babuk ransomware payload is injected into the process and started. This particular variant\n[is similar to previously documented variants with only minor modifications.](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/07/05/deep-dive-into-builder-of-notorious-babuk-ransomware/)\n\nThe ransomware payload creates a mutex with the name \"DoYouWantToHaveSexWithCuongDong, referring to the\nname of the [researcher who analysed it at the beginning of the year.](https://chuongdong.com/reverse%2520engineering/2021/01/03/BabukRansomware/)\n\n_Creation of Babuk mutex._\nThe payload launches the command shell in the background and executes the command to delete the volume\nshadow copy of the victim's machine using vssadmin.exe.\n\n_Deletion of VSS file copies._\nThe payload module then opens the service manager to enumerate running services with the intention to find\nbackup services listed in the below screenshot. If any of the backup services are found the trojan will stop them\nusing the ControlService API function call.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Backup related services from the list are terminated._\nThe payload module traverses the file system to find files to encrypt. After encryption, the files will have a new\nfilename extension .babyk. However, Babuk also contains the list of filenames and directories which will be\nexcluded from the encryption process to keep the affected system running and allow the attackers to communicate\nwith the victim.\n\n_Babuk file extension and the encryption exclusion list._\n\n## Ransom note\n\nThe payload module creates a file called How To Restore your Files.txt, which contains a notification to the victim\nthat their network is compromised and their files are encrypted using AES-256-CTR with the ChaCha8 cipher.\n\nThe actor demands the victim to pay equivalent of 10000 USD paid in Monero (XMR) to the wallet address\n\n46zdZVRjm9XJhdjpipwtYDY51NKbD74bfEffxmbqPjwH6efTYrtvbU5Et4AKCre9MeiqtiR51Lvg2X8dXv1tP7nxLaEHKKQ\nThe actor has also disclosed their email IDs for the victims to contact them for the further instructions and the\ndecryption key after making the payment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Babuk ransom note._\n\n## Tortilla and their infrastructure\n\nTortilla's infrastructure consists of a Unix-based download server and hosts their intermediate unpacker code on a\nsite called pastebin.pl that seems to be unrelated to the popular pastebin.com. Although legitimate, we have\nobserved several previous malicious campaigns, including variants of AgentTesla and Formbook hosting their\nadditional content on the site. Access to the site from a company's network may indicate a successful breach.\n\n**Download server**\n\nAccording to Shodan, the download server at the IP address 185[.]219[.]52[.]229 is located in Moscow, Russia and\nruns OpenSSH and Python version 3.9.7. There are two actor-controlled domains: fbi[.]fund and xxxs[.]info. Both of\nthose domains resolve to the IP address 185[.]219[.]52[.]229, the IP address hosting all malicious modules, with\nthe exception of the intermediate unpacker module hosted on pastebin.pl.\nThe domain xxxs[.]info was used in campaigns running until Oct. 13, 2021 when the actor switched to using\nfbi[.]fund.\n\n_DNS request timeline for xxxs[.]info._\n\n\n-----\n\n_DNS request timeline for fbi[.]fund._\n\n## Victimology\n\nBased on the DNS request distribution to the malicious domains, we are seeing requests coming predominantly\nfrom the U.S., although the campaign has also affected a smaller number of users in the U.K., Germany, Ukraine,\nFinland, Brazil, Honduras and Thailand.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe leak of the Babuk builder and its source code in July have contributed to its wide availability, even for the less\nexperienced ransomware operators, such as Tortilla. This actor has only been operating since early July this year\nand has been experimenting with different payloads, apparently in order to obtain and maintain remote access to\n\n\n-----\n\nthe infected systems. The actor displays low to medium skills with a decent understanding of the security concepts\nand the ability to create minor modifications to existing malware and offensive security tools.\n\nCisco Talos telemetry shows that the actor is using its infrastructure to host malicious modules and conduct\ninternet-wide scanning to exploit vulnerable hosts hosting several popular applications, including Microsoft\nExchange. This particular Babuk campaign seems to primarily rely on exploiting Exchange Server vulnerabilities.\n\nOrganizations and defenders should remain vigilant against such threats and should implement a layered defense\nsecurity with the behavioral protection enabled for endpoints and servers to detect the threats at an early stage of\nthe infection chain.\n\nAs always with ransomware, the staple of the defence are sound backup practices as well as deployment of\ncentralised logging and XDR tools to the most important resources within the organizational networks. In addition\nto that the defenders are urged to apply the latest security patches to all externally facing servers as well as the\nimportant assets in the internal network.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[detailed in this post.
