Kaspersky Lab, however, picked up a](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/65545/the-epic-turla-operation/)\nnumber of the attackers’ searches through their victims’ emails, which included terms such\nas “Nato” and “EU energy dialogue”.\n\nThough attribution is difficult to substantiate, Russia has previously been suspected of\ncarrying out the attacks and Symantec’s Gavin O’Gorman told the Guardian a number of the\nhackers appeared to be using Russian names and language in their notes for their malicious\ncode. Cyrillic was also seen in use.\n\nWhether the attackers are Russian or using Russian identities, their target list and the quality\nof their code indicated they were almost certainly nation state sponsored, the researchers\nsaid.\n\nAs a sign of the high technical capability of the hackers, O’Gorman said they were able to\nspread across company networks very quickly as soon as they had infected one employee.\nIn one case they were able to spread to approximately 40 machines in one organisation\nwithin a day.\n\nThey have also used zero-day vulnerabilities, previously undiscovered software flaws that\nhave not yet been repaired - flaws that require considerable skill, time and resource to\nidentify.\n\n\n-----\n\nTurla has also been developing its own malware for years, eventually adding rootkit\ncapabilities, which run malicious code before the operating system loads. This kind of\nmalware is rare, complex and very useful for spying on systems without being detected.\n\nThe hackers used two techniques to infect victims with the Turla malware, also known as\nUroboros. Either they would hack into sites they believed their targets would visit and launch\nmalware from there, known as “watering hole” attacks, or they would send emails containing\nmalicious links and attachments directly to individuals.\n\nOne set of attacks used fake emails claiming to have come from a military attaché at a\nMiddle Eastern embassy, containing an attachment masquerading as the minutes of\nmeetings. When clicked on the Turla malware would be thrust on to the user’s computer.\n\nKaspersky said it had seen more than 100 websites hacked by the Turla crew, including the\nPalestinian Authority Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe attacks were multi-staged. Often malware called Wipbot was initially downloaded, which\nwould do reconnaissance to determine whether the target was worth surveilling. Wipbot\nwould then be used to download the Turla spy tool, which has far greater capability. That\nwould then give the attackers remote access to the infected computer, meaning they could\nsiphon off the relevant data and install further malware.\n\n“The current campaign is the work of a well-resourced and technically competent attack\ngroup that is capable of penetrating many network defenses,” Symantec added in its blog\npost.\n\n**[Hacker makes $84k hijacking Bitcoin mining pool](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/07/hacker-bitcoin-mining-pool-internet-service-providers-canada-dell)**\n\nTopics\n\n[Hacking](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/hacking)\n\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2014%2Faug%2F07%2Fturla-hackers-spying-governments-researcher-kaspersky-symantec&type=article&internalpagecode=technology/2014/aug/07/turla-hackers-spying-governments-researcher-kaspersky-symantec)\n\n\n-----",
