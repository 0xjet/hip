THE STORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW ANDROID BANKING TROJAN FROM AN OPSEC ERROR\n_Sebastian García_\nStratosphere Laboratory and Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic\n\n_Maria Jose Erquiaga_\nStratosphere Laboratory and UNCUYO University, Argentina\n\n_Anna Shirokova_\nAvast Software, Czech Republic\n\nsebastian.garcia@agents.fel.cvut.cz; mariajoseerquiaga@gmail.com;\nshirokova@avast.com\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nMaintaining a good operational security (OpSec) is diffi cult because it increases the cost of work and\ndecreases the speed of actions. This is true both for security analysts and for attackers. This paper\ndescribes a new botnet, which we called Geost, discovered thanks to multiple OpSec mistakes made\nby the attackers. The mistakes included: the use of the HtBot malware’s illegal proxy network;\nfailing to encrypt the command-and-control servers; re-using security services; trusting other\nattackers that practise even less operational security; and failing to encrypt chat sessions. As far as\nwe know, the Geost botnet has hundreds of malicious domains, 13 C&C servers, approximately\n800,000 victims in Russia, and potential access to several million Euros in bank accounts. Moreover,\nthe operational security mistakes led to the discovery of the names of members of an underground\ngroup related to the Geost botmasters. It is seldom possible to gain such an insight into the decisions\ntaken by attackers due to failures in their operational security. This paper summarizes the mistakes\nand the risks taken by the botmasters, provides an overview of the botnet operation, an analysis of\nthe victims, and a study of the social relationships of the developers.\n\n**1. INTRODUCTION**\n\nIt has always been diffi cult to know exactly how botnet owners (botmasters) operate. It is a complex\ntask to understand the details of their decisions, to see inside their command-and-control (C&C)\nchannels, and to glimpse into their conversations. The three main reasons why it has been diffi cult to\nfi nd this information are:\n\n1. Malware authors operate some degree of operational security (from now on OpSec) in order\nto hide information.\n\n2. The C&C channels are implemented using evasive techniques, such as random domain\nnames, overwhelming analysts with information.\n\n3. It may not legally be possible for analysts to access data and communications in remote servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\nWith all these obstacles combined, the security community rarely sees how botmasters operate, make\ndecisions, and protect their communications.\n\nOpSec failures have been the reason for multiple important discoveries in cybersecurity. OpSec can\nbe defi ned as a ‘risk management process that encourages managers to view operations from the\nperspective of an adversary in order to protect sensitive information from falling into the wrong\nhands’ [1]. The consensus is that OpSec decisions should be carefully designed to be effective against\na certain risk. Problems in OpSec are not limited to technical mistakes but include mistakes made in\nthe correct evaluation of the risks taken, and the countermeasures applied for protection.\n\nThis paper presents a very rare case of a chain of OpSec mistakes leading to the discovery of a new\n_Android banking botnet targeting Russian citizens. It is unusual because the discovery was made_\nwhen the botmasters decided to trust a malicious proxy network called HtBot. Our security\nlaboratory had already been running samples of the HtBot malware for months when a traffi c\nanalysis revealed a group of infected computers being used to manage infected Android phones. The\nHtBot malware provides a proxy service that can be rented to provide secure connecting hosts for\nmalicious activity. Our analysis of this HtBot communication led to the discovery and disclosure of a\nlarge operation infecting _Android-based phones._\n\nAfter the initial discovery of the Geost botnet, the method of analysis consisted of extracting more\ninformation about the attacks, the victims, the operations, its capabilities, and fi nally, about the group\nof developers related to the Geost botnet. Using pivoting techniques of threat hunting it was possible\nto uncover the C&C channels, the domains and IP addresses. Given that more than 72,600 victims\nwere uncovered in just one C&C server, and there are at least 13 C&C channels, a conservative\nestimate of the total number of victims was calculated at 871,200.\n\nThe OpSec failures of the Geost botmasters were signifi cant enough to allow us to recover a large\namount of information. First, the attackers had a fl awed risk model when choosing the appropriate\ncommunication platform for hiding their tracks. They picked up an illegal proxy network, not\nknowing that the network was being monitored by our laboratory. Instead of trusting a good\ncommunication provider, they trusted the security of a badly maintained illegal network. Second, the\nbotmasters didn’t protect their communications with several layers of encryption protocols – making\nit possible for us to see the content of their communications. Third, there was a leaked document on a\npublic website that detailed the chatting activities of a group of developers working on the C&C\nwebsite of the botnet. Since the chat was conducted over Skype, it is possible that it was leaked by a\nmember of the group. Fourth, the chat log revealed that credentials were commonly passed\nunencrypted in the chat, giving access to very important information about them. In summary, a\nchain of small mistakes was enough to disclose the operation of a large Android banking botnet.\n\nThis paper makes the following novel contributions:\n\n - Describes for the fi rst time and names the Geost botnet, unknown to the security community\nuntil now.\n\n - Provides an analysis of the OpSec mistakes that led to the discovery of the activities of a\ncybercrime group acting in Russian-speaking countries.\n\n - Describes the complete infrastructure of the botnet and its victims.\n\n - Publishes indicators of compromise (IoCs) and information to enable the community to act upon\nthe Geost botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\n - Performs a social analysis of the cybercriminal group discovered.\n\n - Makes available for the research community, upon request, all the datasets in reference to the\ndiscovery of the Geost botnet.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 analyses the previous work in this\narea; Section 3 describes the discovery of the Geost botnet; Section 4 shows how the botnet operates;\nSection 5 analyses the infrastructure of the botnet; Section 6 studies the victims of the botnet; Section\n7 discusses the attackers, botmasters and developers; and Section 8 presents our conclusions.\n\n**2. PREVIOUS WORK**\n\nThere are several examples of mistakes made by malware authors that have led to the discovery of\ntheir identities. However, they are usually regarded as technical mistakes rather than OpSec problems\n\n[2]. Technical mistakes are usually discovered as a result of poor OpSec criteria, e.g. code review.\nOpSec problems are hard to mitigate and they usually lead to the discovery of how botmasters\noperate or who they are [3]. Good OpSec can protect the user, but depending on the adversary, small\nmistakes can be very costly. One of the most famous OpSec incidents was that of Guccifer 2.0, the\nalleged persona that attacked the Democratic National Committee in the US, whose real affi liation\nwas supposedly confi rmed when Guccifer 2.0 apparently failed to activate their VPN during one\nlogin process [3]. This is an example of how hard good OpSec can be, even for experienced\nattackers.\n\nA similar case of OpSec failure being taken advantage of by a powerful adversary was the\nidentifi cation of the owner of the Silk Road drug-selling site, Ross Ulbricht. Ulbricht was found\nbecause he used his personal email account to register other accounts related to his illegal site [4].\nAlthough good OpSec is possible [5], cybercriminals also make mistakes that put them in jeopardy.\n\nPractising good OpSec is hard, and it’s harder when others try to force mistakes. In 2009 the\nMariposa botmasters were captured because they connected to their servers directly from their\nhomes. They usually used VPN services but after the police took their servers down (to force their\nhand), the botmasters panicked and connected insecurely. This paper provides an analysis of OpSec\nmistakes committed by a group of attackers while managing part of a botnet.\n\nRegarding previous work on the Geost botnet, the only previous unnamed reference found was a post\nfrom September 2017 on the blog site Virqdroid [6]. This blog post analysed one of the malware’s\nAPK fi les, showed its technical qualities, and reported the IoCs. However, the blog lacked data about\nthe threat, the attackers and the victims, and therefore conclusions could not be drawn as to the size\nof the operation or the identity of the Android banking botnet.\n\nProbably the most well-studied part of Android banking trojans are the binaries themselves. This is\nbecause binaries are the fi rst contact with the security community and usually the only source of\ninformation. The number of binaries related to Android banking trojans suggest that these threats\nhave been rising during 2017 [7] and 2018 [8], although no scientifi c study has focused on a\nsystematic analysis of the problem. Android banking malware is too numerous to describe, but a few\nimportant mentions can be made. In the early 2000s trojans Perkele and ibanking were well known\nfor using SMS as a communication channel [9]. From 2014 there was a new era of banking botnets\nwith the appearance of Slempo, Marcher, Shiz, BankBot and MazarBOT [9]. Their infection\ntechniques, C&C protocols, and the attacks performed were signifi cantly improved.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\nAnalysing a malware binary is very useful, but the network traffi c provides a different perspective.\nEven though some binary analysis may reveal network traffi c [10], it is very diffi cult to capture\ntraffi c from the botmaster’s actions. In this regard, this paper shows a novel discovery of real\nbotmasters’ actions while using their C&C servers.\n\n**3. DISCOVERY**\n\nThe Geost Android banking botnet was discovered as part of a larger malware analysis operation in\nour laboratory. During an experiment in which a sample of the HtBot malware was executed [11], the\ntraffi c analysis revealed a very unusual communication pattern that stood out from the rest.\n\nHtBot operates by converting its victims into unwilling private illegal Internet proxies. The infected\nvictims relay communications from the HtBot users to the Internet. HtBot is regarded as an\nunderground proxy network that is diffi cult for security analysts to tap, since its traffi c is continually\nredirected to new victims. The users of the HtBot network pay the HtBot botmasters to provide them\nwith high-speed, semi-private communications for their operations.\n\n_Figure 1: Discovery of the Geost botnet. A monitored bot of the HtBot malware was used by the_\n_Geost botmasters. First, the Geost botmaster connected to the HtBot network; second, the HtBot_\n_network relayed the data to our bot; third, our bot sent the traffi c to the Internet; fourth, the_\n_botmaster accessed the Geost C&C server on the Internet._\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\nOur laboratory was running and monitoring HtBot bots that were communicating with the Internet.\nSince these bots offered illegal proxy connections it was possible to capture all the traffi c coming\nfrom the illegal users to the Internet. During the analysis of the network traffi c of the illegal users, a\npattern was discovered; this turned out to be the content of the C&C communication channel of the\nnew Geost botnet.\n\nFigure 1 shows the infrastructure operation of the HtBot malware and how it was used to fi nd the\nnew Geost botnet. When the botmasters of the Geost botnet connected to the HtBot proxy network\nthey sent all their traffi c through our victim bot, and therefore through our monitoring service.\nTherefore, all the information collected about Geost’s actions comes from looking at the traffi c going\nthrough our computer.\n\nThe analysis of the HtBot malware traffi c revealed the pattern shown in Figure 2. This pattern was\ndiscovered thanks to two features that stand out: the large amount of traffi c transferred and the lack\nof encryption. Transfers of such large amounts of unencrypted data are not common in a normal\nnetwork. The use of unencrypted web servers for the C&C operation was the second OpSec mistake\nmade by the botmasters. It is not clear why they neglected to use TLS encryption, since it is free and\neasy to install. The main hypothesis is that they may have had a large number of C&C servers and\nmanaging the certifi cates for them all would have been time consuming.\n\n_Figure 2: Unencrypted traffi c pattern of the Geost botnet that helped to fi nd it. This traffi c was later_\n_found to correspond with the download of SMS messages from the Android phone victims._\n\nThe OpSec decision of the Geost botmasters to use the HtBot proxy botnet is believed to be based on\nthe idea that an illegal proxy network may have better security than other alternatives, such as the Tor\nnetwork [12], a commercial VPN network, or their own compromised servers on the Internet. The\nTor network was probably discarded as a bad OpSec choice since it is known to be monitored [13].\nThe option of a commercial VPN has the disadvantage that the botmasters would be putting their\ntrust in a private company that may be forced to submit its logs to the authorities. The third option, of\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\ncompromised servers, may be the best from an OpSec point of view, but it would involve extending\nthe current Android banking botnet with another layer of servers, infections, malware, monitoring,\nand maintenance. This option is much more costly than the rest. The decision to use the HtBot\nnetwork may have seemed wise since it does not belong to a company, it’s not usually monitored,\nand it handles its own maintenance. In the end, though, the decision to use the HtBot network was\nthe fi rst operational security mistake. It seems that the balance of probabilities and cost-benefi t\nanalysis were not correctly evaluated by the botmasters.\n\n**4. BOTNET OPERATIONS**\n\nThe main advantage of accessing the botmasters’ traffi c while they were using the HtBot network\nwas the possibility of a deep study of the attackers’ decisions and actions. The analysis helped to\nidentify a large botnet infrastructure, measure the size of the operation, and determine the goal of the\nbotnet. Based on the evidence found, the Geost operation seems to consist of a large number of APK\n_Android applications related to several topics, from banks and photo services, to fake social_\nnetworks. Once the applications are installed it seems that they may be able to interact directly with\nthe web services of fi ve banks in Eastern Europe. It seems that one of the goals of the botnet is to\naccess the personal information of the victims through their SMS messages, including those\nmessages sent by the banks. The rest of this section describes the actions of the botmasters and how\nthey helped identify each part of the Geost botnet. It is worth remembering that this was the traffi c\ntraversing our HtBot instance.\n\n**Access and actions in the C&C servers**\n\nThe botmasters accessed the C&C servers through a web server using port 80/TCP. The web server\nwas running nginx version 1.12.2. The fi rst connection seen in the traffi c was made on Sat, 10 Mar\n2018 11:54:08 GMT and it was an access to the C&C server with the following request (not\ncomplete):\n\nGET /geost.php?bid=c5d72910bd8a97aeb2ce\n\n7336fbd78a1f HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: wgg4ggefwg.ru\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;\n\nrv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0\n\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\n\nReferer: http://wgg4ggefwg.ru/geost.php\n\nCookie: SSE=p6ee96ki2knqrtsahdv84cuj04;\n\n__lnkrntdmcvrd=-1\n\nFrom this request several things can be learned. First, that the botmaster was already logged in,\nbecause the cookie was already set. Second, that the botmaster was probably using a Windows\ncomputer, given the User-Agent. Third, that the domain was wgg4ggefwg.ru, and that the request\nwas coming from the web page http://wgg4ggefwg.ru/geost.php. After this fi rst request, the\nbotmaster changed a note on one of the victims with the following request:\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\nPOST /stuff .php?mode=change_notes\n\n(...)\n\nbid=c5d72910bd8a97aeb2ce7336fbd78a1f&\n\nnotes=14.50+10.03+68.000\n\nThe fact that the botmasters put notes on individual victims suggests that they may have been after\nsomething more than automatic access to their bank accounts. After changing the note for a victim,\nthe botmaster requested a list of SMS messages from a victim with the HTTP request\nPOST /stuff .php?mode=showSmsList. The response to this request was a long list of more than\n900 SMS messages from one victim. The SMS messages are analysed in Section 6.\n\nThe original HTTP response with the SMS list was a JSON fi le using Unicode encoding (\\u chars)\nfor transferring Russian characters. The following is an example:\n\n{“response”: [{“conversations”:\n\n{“+900”:[{“body”:”\\u0421\\u043f\n\n\\u0438\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\n\nThe decoded text in Russian is as follows (the password was redacted):\n\nСписание средств: Platbox (RUB 120.00); пароль: 342365.Не сообщайте пароль\nНИКОМУ. Только мошенники запрашивают пароли.\n\nThe English translation of this message is:\n\nWithdrawal of funds: Platbox (RUB 120.00); password: 342365. Do not disclose\nthe password to ANYONE. Only fraudsters request passwords.\n\nThis SMS seems to be a message from the Platbox Russian payment system saying that 120 Russian\nRubles have been withdrawn. Despite our initial assumption that the botnet was only looking for\ntwo-factor authentication messages, it is unclear why the botmasters are monitoring these messages.\nThe fi rst important remark is that the C&C stores the complete list of SMS messages of all the\nvictims since the moment they were infected. The second important remark is that the SMSs were\nprocessed offl ine in the C&C server to automatically compute the balance of each victim. This can\nbe seen in the C&C web page shown in Figure 4.\n\nThe SMS messages stored and used by Geost contained highly sensitive information. For example, a\nvictim infected from July 2017 until March 2018 received the following SMS:\n\n - Transfers in bank accounts:\n\n[redacted]Bank Online. Lada SE[name\n\nredacted]NA transferred to you 2500 RUB\n\nA message from a bank to a victim about money received.\n\n - VISA balances:\n\nVISA5880 03/07/18 18:32 admission\n\n2500r Balance: 49866.86\n\nThis information about balances was analysed automatically by the C&C channel.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\n**Botmaster access to the login page**\n\nMore than eight days after the fi rst access, a botmaster showed up again to access the Geost C&C\nserver. It may have been a different botmaster because the User-Agent of their browser was different\nfrom the fi rst time. The fi rst time, the User-Agent was Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:48.0)\n_Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0, which is a Windows computer. The second time it was Mozilla/5.0_\n_(Windows NT 6.1; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0, which is an older version of browser in a_\n_Windows computer. Since it’s very unlikely that the botmaster downgraded the browser, the_\nconclusion is that these are different computers.\n\nDuring this second access, it was possible to observe the complete login process and to obtain the\nmaster password of the C&C server. The long-term execution of the malware, which is standard\npolicy in our laboratory, made possible the capture of this important piece of information. This\nconnection also reveals the third OpSec error: the botmasters believed that it was safe to use the\nHtBot proxy network again. This is a huge underestimation of the security risk of using the same\nservice twice. A better approach would have been to change the connection method every time.\n\nThe login request was sent as GET /geost.php and resulted in the login page shown in Figure 3.\nThis page was reconstructed in our browsers by extracting the data from the traffi c capture. The login\npage has an option to change the language between Russian and English, which suggests that the\nbotmasters may speak either of those languages.\n\nAfter the login page was presented, the botmaster logged in with the following request (not complete):\n\nPOST /stuff .php?mode=autorize HTTP/1.1\nHost: wgg4ggefwg.ru\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT\n6.1; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nReferer: http://wgg4ggefwg.ru/geost.php\nContent-Length: 31\nCookie: SSE=epr0dr4qlejbgphtqppmmjrca0\n\npwd=[redacted]&language=ru\n\nThe password used was 15 characters long and included nine numbers and six lower-case letters. The\nfact that the password was leaked means that it would be possible for others to log into the C&C\nserver. The password is not incredibly complex since it lacked symbols and upper-case letters, but it\nis considered strong enough to resist the casual brute-forcer. It is also worth noting that there is a\ntypo in the name of the request parameter, which is ‘autorize’ instead of authorize.\n\n_Figure 3: Login page of the C&C server of the Geost botnet. No TLS was used and no username is_\n_requested, only a password._\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\nAfter logging in, the botmaster accessed the main panel of the C&C, shown in Figure 4. The main C&C\nweb page is quite large, showing more than 7,500 infected phones and information about the version of\nthe malware, IMEI of the phones, permissions of the malware, country of the phones, balance in the\nbank accounts, and much more. Figure 4 shows the following information for each victim:\n\n - Status: whether the victim is online.\n\n - ID: identifi cation number of the victim assigned by the botnet.\n\n - IMEI: code that identifi es each cell phone.\n\n - Rights: probably whether the malware has admin rights, or only SMS access, or both.\n\n - Version: version of the Android operating system.\n\n - Operator: phone operator.\n\n - Country: country of the phone – it is not clear how this is obtained, but probably using the phone\nnumber.\n\n - Balance: balance in the bank of the user.\n\n - Category: it is not clear what is this menu for – the options are: Balance, Spam, Dead, Lok,\nTupyat, Sliv, Credit, OTKLU4en, NULOVKI and ONLIKI.\n\n - Flow: probably to identify how the phone was infected, given that the options are: marion1, dea\nand sitedub, which are related to APK applications.\n\n_Figure 4: Main page of the C&C server of the Geost botnet. The C&C shows actions for injecting in_\n_banks and managing spam._\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\n**Features of the C&C**\n\nBy looking at the options on the C&C page it is possible to infer the goals of the botnet and its main\nactivities. From the top menu it can be seen that the management of injects (specifi c applications for\neach bank) is important, as well as the management of spam, SMS and Tasks. Under the menu\nПоток, which means Flow or Stream, there are the following options:\n\n - svd2\n\n - iYl5i8 (Photo Youla). [Site youla.ru]\n\n - EBtiym (Photo Avito). [Site www.avito.ru]\n\n - apkmontman\n\n - CvKa5S (321)\n\n - 2s1Kb1 (Antivirus_PRO)\n\n - marion1\n\n - sTPYWM (Установка) (means Installation)\n\n - zGnI6m (Вконтакт) (translates to VKontakte, a Facebook-like Russian social network)\n\n - dea\n\n  - Установка installation\n\n  - Установить to install\n\n - sitedub\n\n - BPg5nZ (123)\n\n - wdbX4p (OK). OK.RU. https://ok.ru/\n\n - q5Q9PR (Skype)\n\n - QX3YrO (WhatsApp)\n\n - GHf5Bt (Ula). https://youla.ru/\n\n - I97CiN (Imo). ImoOnline.ru. Instant messaging app and VoIP.\n\n - VAm5bd (VK)\n\n - 2SUeYJ (Viber)\n\n - wsmQDO (Telegram)\n\n - 6NiFak (Yandex navigator)\n\n - ge4twN (Badoo)\n\n - mHhP71 (Shazam)\n\n - udc13a (QIWI)\n\n - gEc0m2 (Aliexpress)\n\n - 9ObVTr (2GIS). https://2gis.ru/\n\n - HaBxsX (ccleaner)\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\n - RA6XMX (Clean Master)\n\n - resur\n\n - All\n\n - NEuVxP (updateplayer)\n\n - bjAVX1 (updateplayer2018)\n\nThe meaning of this menu is not completely clear but we suspect that it refers to a fi lter as to how the\nvictim was infected, since all the options refer to Android applications. This theory was confi rmed\nlater when it was found that each botnet operator has its own ‘Flow id’ to determine how many\ninfections they produced. After accessing the main C&C web page the botmaster requested to fi lter\nthe victims by their online status using the following request:\n\n/stuff .php?mode=fi lter_online\n\nAfter the victims were sorted by online status, the botmaster sorted them by balance amount using\nthe following request:\n\n/stuff .php?mode=fi lter_balance\n\nThese two actions suggest that the intention was to see the online victims that have the largest\nbalance of money, probably to act on them in some way, but no action was witnessed.\n\n**Banks attacked**\n\nBy accessing the client-side source code of the web page in the network traffi c, it was possible to\nidentify which banks were the focus of the Geost botnet. The fact that only fi ve banks were listed\nsuggests that there is a special type of action that can only happen with those banks. It may seem as\nif the malware APKs or the C&C code could access and make transfers in accounts of those banks,\nbut this hypothesis was not proven. For security reasons the complete list of banks will not be\npublished until the banks acknowledge our contact with them. However, it is possible to provide the\nfollowing characteristics of the targeted banks:\n\n - The fi rst bank is a Russian commercial neobank. One of the top fi ve providers of credit cards in\nRussia.\n\n - The second bank is one of the fi ve largest private commercial banks in Russia and one of the top\n1,000 world banks.\n\n - The third bank is one of the three largest banks in Russia and Eastern Europe, and one of the top\n40 banks in the world.\n\n - The fourth bank is one of the 500 largest organizations in Europe and one of the leading banks in\nRussia.\n\n - The fi fth bank is part of a large group of cooperatives with subsidiaries in more than 15\ncountries, being in the top seven banks in Russia.\n\n - The sixth bank is a publicly traded Russian payment service provider operating electronic online\npayment systems in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Belarus, Romania, the United States\nand the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\n**5. BOTNET INFRASTRUCTURE**\n\nThe infrastructure used by Geost is large but not extremely complex. To date, 13 C&C IP addresses,\nmore than 140 domains, and more than 150 APKs fi les have been found. The domains seem to be\nrandomly generated, but not with a complete domain generation algorithm.\n\n**Randomness in Geost**\n\nDomain generation algorithms (DGAs) are algorithms that generate domains in a pseudorandom\nway. This is used as a mechanism to avoid detection and hide the C&C server by resolving a new IP\naddress very quickly. Since the algorithm is unknown to the analyst, they are usually unpredictable.\nHowever, the malware author knows the algorithm and therefore can predict which domain will be\nrequested. The attacker then registers the domain with an IP address they control. There are usually\nthree main ways to identify a DGA algorithm: (1) the domains seem random, (2) dozens of domains\nare requested very quickly, and (3) most of the domains do not have an IP assigned to them.\nHowever, in the case of Geost, the domain generation algorithm is very unusual. It looks random\nenough, but each sample only attempts to contact one domain. Also, all the domains found so far do\nhave an IP address assigned. It is not clear, then, how the domains are assigned to each sample, but it\nappears that each domain is assigned to one sample. The DGA used in the Geost botnet is characterbased, uses letters and numbers, and the TLD is .ru or .xyz. The only domain that broke the rule was\ng877855hrg.ru.com.\n\nThe following is a sample list of Geost C&C domains:\n\n - w23t2t2tfwg.ru\n\n - wg34gh34t.xyz\n\n - 32r3t23wef.ru\n\n - ijsdggrur.ru\n\n - wgg4ggefwg.ru\n\n - 52t34tyt43.xyz\n\nAnother novel feature of Geost in reference to randomness is the use of an algorithm to generate PHP\nfi le names. This is not strictly DGA since they are not domains, but the random principle is the same.\nThe main difference between a classic DGA and the PHP fi le generation algorithm is the purpose.\nWhile classic DGAs are intended to prevent the discovery of the botnet domains and subsequent\ntakedown, the PHP fi le generation algorithm prevents the generation of signatures to fi nd and block\nthose names. It is not simple, for example, to create a YARA rule that matches a DGA domain using\na random PHP fi le. The PHP fi lenames are 32 characters long, the same as an MD5 string. The\nfollowing is a sample list of the fi lenames for the domain 2ve3gh53h3yh.ru:\n\n - m99h49wtp1g35b5721d64mfs5p8ese1x.php\n\n - n7co2vpu098x85ctgdn689rf4d18n5jz.php\n\n - fhdkqgyfux4gj2t6zwu434ptw0i0mefu.php\n\n - csbu72ow56i9qq7yg1ufbo3ql1phb1s6.php\n\n - f8t8d5tnqvwwi1l2qf0itr97cdibre6i.php\n\n - hgkvf2riqt49z33isl978pj17aivc0nw.php\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\nThe fi nal characteristic of Geost domains is that some of them have a large number of subdomains.\nFor instance, the domain 2ve3gh53h3yh.ru has exactly 1,024 subdomains, such as 0hu, 00n, 03, 06p\nand 090.\n\n**IP addresses**\n\nAt least 13 IP addresses have been found so far. Table 1 shows a summary of the IP addresses with,\nfor each one, the Autonomous System (AS), country, number of domains related to the IP, and the\nnumber of APK hashes that communicate with it.

However, both terms are generic and used to identify thousands of binaries that are\nprotected by a software packer or an obfuscating method. Therefore, this particular botnet has not\nbeen identifi ed by the community until now. As an example of how each APK was detected by\n_VirusTotal, Table 2 shows a subsample of the total number of APKs and their detection ratios._\n\n**Relationships in the infrastructure**\n\nAmong the uncommon characteristics of the Geost infrastructure are: (i) each domain corresponds to\na unique IP address; (ii) no domain was ever seen without an IP address registered; (iii) each IP\naddress has more than one domain assigned to it; (iv) domains always refer to the same IP address. It\nis worth noting that the Geost malware used random generation of words at least in three places: (1)\nto generate its domain names, (2) to generate the names of PHP fi les, and (3) to generate the names\nof the APK packages.\n\nAn example relationship between the pieces of the botnet’s infrastructure is the sample\n92a3a69c6c0922ace36ca3ac95fcbbb6. This sample communicated with the domain wef34r34rs.xyz,\nwhich resolved to the IP address 154.16.244.28. This sample targeted three of the top fi ve Russian\nbanks and the name of its package is ‘com.vuzbswbpv.ipapszyud’. The same IP address was also\nassigned to the domain t43r43r43.xyz that is requested by the sample\n92a8aa2c6dd86aeab67e687de2c9e6a9591bee17.\n\n**6. VICTIMS**\n\nThe traffi c generated by the botmasters when accessing the C&C server revealed information about\nthe victims of this botnet. It seems that the botmasters kept a detailed summary of the victims, and\nthat this summary was important for the operation of the botnet. The victims of this botnet not only\nprobably lose money but they had their privacy and identity completely compromised. The minimum\namount of information that the botmasters know about each victim can be seen in the following list:\n\n - IMEI of the phone\n\n - Brand of the phone\n\n - Phone service provider\n\n - Phone number\n\n - Country of the phone number\n\n - Current balance of bank accounts\n\n - History of balance in each bank account (the history of the balance is not even available to the\nvictims themselves)\n\n - Whether they have a credit card tied to the phone\n\n - From the SMS of the victims:\n\n   - Name of victim\n\n   - Home address\n\n   - Social relationships\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\n   - Religion\n\n   - Purchases\n\n  - Expenses\n\n   - Financial problems.\n\nRegarding the number of victims, it is only possible to speculate. In the C&C server of the IP address\n162.222.213.28 there were 50 victims per page, and there were 1,452 pages, which gives an\nestimation of 72,600 victims in that C&C alone. Extrapolating this to the 13 C&C servers, a rough\nestimation of the total number of victims may be 871,200. It is possible that even more victims exist,\ngiven that there may be more C&C servers.\n\nAccording to the 50 victims shown in one of the C&C screens, there is a column labelled ‘Balance’\nthat shows the amount of money (in Rubles) in the bank accounts of the victims. The total sum of\nthis column of 50 victims is 1,129,152 Rubles, which is approximately 15,000 Euros. Extrapolating\nthis number to the estimated 800,000 victims in this C&C there may be an estimated maximum total\namount of money close to 240,000,000 Euros. However, the real total for this C&C could be much\nlower if we consider that the web page is sorted by balance.\n\n**IMEI**\n\nOf all the information stolen from the victims, the IMEI is important because it can be used to\nidentify them. The IMEI is a unique code assigned to cell phones and, by searching for it online, it is\npossible to fi nd out information about the device. The IMEI number is divided into parts. The initial\neight-digit portion of the IMEI, known as the Type Allocation Code (TAC), details the phone model\nand origin. The remainder of the IMEI is manufacturer-defi ned, with a Luhn check digit at the end.\nGiven the IMEI, it is possible to determine the victim’s phone model and characteristics. From the\nIMEI it was possible to learn the brands of the phones of the victims, which were all Android-based.\nFrom the IMEI numbers it was also possible to identify the victims’ phone operators, including\n_Tele2, MTS RUS, Beeline, MegaFon, Yota and Motiv. The last one is a Russian regional provider._\n\n**SMS data**\n\nThe access to SMS messages was probably one of the more invasive actions of the botnet. SMS\nmessages potentially contain a lot of private information about the user. An analysis of the two SMS\nlists downloaded revealed that users shared very private conversations with friends and lovers, the\nstatus of their fi nancial accounts, and sensitive private data about themselves. It was particularly\ninteresting to fi nd that most of the private information was leaked by the phone operators, including\nusers’ real name, birthday, the last four numbers of their credit card, the amount of money in their\nbalance, and the password for mobile banking applications. The following is an example SMS stolen\nby the attackers (without personal information):\n\n07/03/18 18:59 VISA5880 purchase 120r\n\nMTS TOPUP 5635 Balance: 49746.86r\n\n**7. ATTACKERS**\n\nOne of the most important breakthroughs of this analysis was the discovery of a fi le in a public web\npage that referenced one of the Geost domains. This fi le proved to be the chat log of a group of\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\npeople related to the Geost botnet operation. It is not clear how the fi le was leaked, but since it was a\n_Skype chat log it was probably created (whether on purpose or not) by one of the participants in the_\nchat. The use of Skype as a communication medium is consistent with previous reports on the modus\noperandi of the Russian malware community [14]. The existence of this fi le marks another OpSec\nerror on the part of the botmasters: they trusted part of the operation to a group of users with very\nlow or non-existent OpSec practices.\n\nIt was possible, then, to conduct an open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigation to fi nd out more\nabout the group in this chat log. The fi le has more than 6,200 lines, covering eight months of chats,\nand shows the private conversations of 29 people. Not all of them seem to be related to the Geost\nbotnet since the group had several alternative streams of revenue. By analysing the top participants in\nthe chat log it was possible to determine that the user ‘powerfaer’ was the only one talking with all\nthe participants, making this user the probable owner of the chat log.\n\nDuring the time period from 2017-06-11 11:14 to 2018-04-17 18:41, powerfaer held business\ndiscussions with the other 28 people in relation to different projects. The conversations between\npowerfaer and the user with the nickname ‘mirrexx777’ seem to be the most notable since they\nshowed a connection with the Geost botnet. For instance, on several occasions powerfaer and\nmirrexx777 exchanged links to the control panel of the Geost botnet, sharing information that\nnobody would possess unless they were insiders. The following is a human translation from Russian:\n\nOn 2017-10-18 07:24:07\nFrom powerfaer to mirrexx777:\nhttp://2[redacted]e.xyz/stats.php?sid=\n7NDNI0aercTtwPA\ntitle:Statistics\n\nRe-crypt, Kaspersky got cleaned\n\nFrom mirrexx777 to powerfaer:\nok. will do. according to the old\nrecordings how many of them remains?\ni want to start to keep a record\n\nThe fact that they shared information from inside the C&C channels – information that you need to\nbe logged in to see (the stats.php fi le) – and the fact that they discuss the need to fi x them, is strong\nevidence that they possess internal information with complete knowledge of its purpose. There were\nmany pieces of evidence in the chat log showing a relationship with malware actions, such as asking\nto re-encrypt links because Kaspersky was able to detect them.\n\nIt seems that the user powerfaer has operated since 2010. This is supported by one conversation where\nthere was a remark about the income from traffi c in 2010 having been better (translated from Russian):\n\nOn 2017-12-06 18:14:46\nFrom powerfaer to mirrexx777:\nThat would be nice to get back in to 2012\nOr 2010\n\nSome conversations in the chat got serious and resulted in the use of real names as a means to call\nthe attention of the other. This confi rmed the names of some aliases. The following log confi rmed the\nname of ‘taganchik.ru’ when powerfaer talked to him (translated from Russian):\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\nAlexander, really, if we started together we need to fi nish it. Because for now\nthis is working and we can earn money. Not every day we are getting 100k for\npromotion\n\nLater on, however, it seems that the user taganchik.ru tried to leave the group:\n\n2017-10-15l14:53\nFrom taganchik.ru to powerfaer:\n(...) But now im saying i am working but\nin fact I dont. I am getting demotivated\nand do not want to do anything\n\nFrom taganchik.ru to powerfaer:\ni thought about it, and im not in\n\nFrom powerfaer to taganchik.ru:\nUnderstand, ok. Shame. If you change\nyour mind write to me\n\nShowing a complete lack of OpSec, the chat log also revealed credentials for several servers and\nservices, such as fttkit.com (an Android application protection service advertised on the Russian\nunderground site crimina.la). The log also disclosed the IDs of online wallets, and credit card\nnumbers. This information helped us fi nd sensitive information about the identity of some\nindividuals. For instance, ‘taganchik.ru’, ‘elkol95’ and ‘dmitrixxx89’ all advertise their services on\nthe same web marketing forum, https://searchengines.guru/.\n\nThe user powerfaer also engaged in conversations with several money launderers. The log confi rms\nthat online payment systems such as WebMoney, Qiwi, and Yandex Money remain popular among\nRussian cybercriminals [15]. However, these services are not anonymous and it would be possible to\nsee the payments through third-party money launderers. The following is an example chat with the\nuser ‘cyberhosting.ru’:\n\nOn 2017-12-04 11:21\npowerfaer wrote to cyberhosting.ru\nAnd another question,\ncan you exchange cash to BTC?\n\nA challenge for us during the analysis was to understand the Russian underground slang. For example,\nthe term white accounting should be translated to Russian as Белая бухгалтерия. However,\ncybercriminals used the term белка, which in English means squirrel. The same issue applies to other\nwords like application, which translates to прила in Russian and has no direct translation in English.\n\nAfter a deep OSINT analysis it was possible to infer a list of probable real names for the following\nnicknames: ‘mirrexx777’, ‘powerfaer’, ‘cyberhosting.ru’, ‘taganchik.ru’, ‘doktorsaitov’,\n‘dmitrixxx89’, and ‘maximchik700’. However, the names will not be published since their\nimplication in the Geost operation has not been confi rmed.\n\n**8. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK**\n\nThe discovery of the Geost Android banking botnet inside the traffi c of another malware proxy shows\nthat operational security is very hard to get right, and that simple mistakes can lead to deep\nunderstanding of the operations of malware authors. After the discovery of the Geost botmasters\n\n\n-----\n\n**LONDON**\n**2 – 4 October 2019**\n\naccessing their C&C servers it was possible to fi nd more and more pieces of their botnet infections,\nleading to a very large mapping of their attack infrastructure, their APK binaries, the number of\nvictims infected, and an estimation of the economic size of the operation. Finally, it was possible to\nuse open-source intelligence to relate a group of developers to part of the infrastructure-building\nprocess of the botnet. The developers do not seem to be the Geost botmasters, but an underground\ngroup related to them.\n\nDespite operating since at least 2016, the Geost botnet remained unknown until its traffi c was\ncaptured on the HtBot malware. This may suggest that the best OpSec may be to hide operations\namong thousands of other malware. However, once the operation was found, it was clear that the\ngroup’s OpSec measures were not good since there were several mistakes that have led to\ninformation about the operation.\n\nThe following is a summary of the operational security mistakes that led to the identifi cation and\nunderstanding of the botnet:\n\n - Use of the illegal proxy network HtBot. Wrong estimation of the risk of using a service that was\nbeing tracked in a security laboratory.\n\n - Failure to encrypt C&C traffi c. It was possible to identify the traffi c and the content of the\ncommunications.\n\n - Use of the same protection service multiple times. This allowed repeated monitoring of the\nattackers and the capture of credentials.\n\n - The hiring of a group of developers with very low OpSec, who disclosed links, names and\ncredentials in their chats.\n\n - Failure to encrypting chats. This allowed a document to be leaked containing important\ninformation about the privacy of some attackers and leads about their identities.\n\nThe amount of information collected on the Geost botnet was so large that it has not been possible to\ninclude all the details of the infrastructure, the victims found, banks accounts disclosed, phones\ninfected, credit cards used, and the very interesting view of the social relationships within a group of\nunderground cybercriminals. Therefore, our analysis of the Geost botnet will continue in several\ndirections. The name ‘Geost’ was selected after the only web page that didn’t seem to change in the\nC&C servers.\n\n**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**\n\nWe would like to thank Veronica Valeros for her help during the analysis and extraction of\ninformation.
