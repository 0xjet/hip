I imagine\nthat Zscaler has some sort of malware hunting capability (potentially LiveHunt YARA rules in\nVirusTotal) and they manually check for ransom notes uploaded to VT containing strings\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch as .onion to find new and interesting ransomware families. However they actually do\nit, this is a handy repo for the community to use.\n\nThree new ransom notes that Zscaler shared that caught my eye belonged to Shadow,\n8BASE, and Rancoz. Tracking new ransomware families can be an interesting task because\nso many new groups are appearing, it is hard to tell which ones are worth paying attention to\nof the literal hundreds of variants out there launching attacks. These three stick out, however,\ndue to the presence of the \".onion\" Tor link inside their ransom notes though because that\nmeans they have setup custom infrastructure for advanced cyber extortion, such as\nnegotiation portals, decryption sites, or a data leak site (DLS) to post stolen data if the victim\nrefuses to pay.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: An original Seinfeld meme\n\n\n-----\n\nCybercrime intelligence analysts who investigate new ransomware groups should know that\nit's important to make note when new groups appear and try to see if there are any\nconnections to known threat actors. This helps with intelligence collection efforts and can\nhelp analysts decide whether investigating these groups should be a priority. There is only a\nlimited amount of time and a limited amount of resources and, unfortunately, so so many\nransomware groups. Using the ransom notes we can try to identify similarities to other known\nransomware families.\n\nFigure 2: Ransom Notes\n\nWhat is Stylometry and Stylometric Analysis?\nStylometry is the application of the study of linguistic style, usually to written language but it\ncan also be applied to code and ransom notes. It has also been applied successfully to\nmusic, paintings, and chess. We can evaluate an author's style through manual comparisons\nas well as the application of statistical analysis to a body of their work. Stylometry is often\nused to attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed documents. To unmask these\nransomware group for who they really are, I used a mixture of the text comparison site\ncopyleaks.com and by doing it manually.\n\nShadow\nAnalysis of Shadow's ransom note, although with some original elements, there are\nnumerous similarities between it an LockBit3.0's ransom note. We can say with fairly strong\n[accuracy that this is a reskin of the leaked LockBit3.0 (aka LockBitBlack) builder. There are](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-builder-leaked-online-by-angry-developer-/)\nmultiple similarities in the notes that tie these two together. The wide availability of the leaked\nbuilder also makes this overlap a very likely scenario The Shadow ransom note is available\n\n\n-----\n\n[in Zscaler s GitHub repo (see here). The LockBit3.0 ransom note is available from PCRisk](https://github.com/threatlabz/ransomware_notes/blob/main/shadow/%5Brand%5D.README.txt)\n(see [here).](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/24242-lockbit-3-0-ransomware)\n\nFigure 3: Comparison between Shadow and LockBit3.0 ransom notes\n\n8BASE\nWhen I examined the 8BASE ransom note it also looked familiar. It turned out that it share a\n[ton of similarities to a ransom note from the leaked builder of Babuk ransomware. Again, due](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomwares-full-source-code-leaked-on-hacker-forum/)\n[to the availability of the Babuk ransomware builder and numerous ransomware groups that](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hypervisor-ransomware-multiple-threat-actor-groups-hop-on-leaked-babuk-code-to-build-esxi-lockers/)\nuse it, this is also a likely scenario. The 8BASE ransom note is available in Zscaler's GitHub\nrepo (see [here). The ransom note of the DarkAngel's variant of Babuk ESXi is available from](https://github.com/threatlabz/ransomware_notes/blob/main/8base/8base_note.txt)\nPCRisk (see [here).](https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/23738-dark-angels-team-ransomware)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Comparison of 8BASE and Babuk ESXi ransom notes\n\nRancoz\n[Rancoz seemed to be a little bit more interesting as Cyble analyzed Rancoz (see here) and](https://blog.cyble.com/2023/05/11/dissecting-rancoz-ransomware/)\nshared some technical insights. Twitter researcher @F_kZ_ also highlighted the similarities\n[between the Rancoz and 0mega data leak sites (see here). However, neither mentioned that](https://twitter.com/F_kZ_/status/1654384721751621635)\nthe ransom note is practically identical to the LockBit3.0 note. The Rancoz ransom note is\n[available in Zscaler GitHub repo (see here)](https://github.com/threatlabz/ransomware_notes/blob/main/rancoz/HOW_TO_RECOVERY_FILES.txt)\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of Rancoz and LockBit 3.0 ransom notes\n\n\n-----\n\nConclusion\nRansomware research is pretty straight forward these days. These types of cybercriminals\nprefer templated attacks, reusing tried and trust TTPs. Now, they do not even need to code\ntheir own ransomware or partner with RaaS groups. There are multiple freely available\nleaked builders ready for them to use instantly.\n\nLockBit and Babuk provide low skilled and few resourced the immediate ability to attack and\nransom large organizations. There have already been dozens of variants of these two\nfamilies. Shadow, 8BASE, and Rancoz are also not likely to be the last.\n\nMy advice is to keep an eye on these threat actors as eventually they may begin to retool\nand evolve. While they are still inexperienced is the best time to try and track them down.\nAny tips you have to do that are best sent to law enforcement, as well as groups like The\nRansomware Task Force and NoMoreRansom.\n\n## Detecting and Fingerprinting Infostealer Malware-as-a-Service platforms\n\n Brute Ratel cracked and shared across the Cybercriminal Underground\n\n The Continuity of Conti\n\n\n-----",
