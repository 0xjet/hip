    "plain_text": "# Microsoft Internal Solorigate Investigation Update\n\n**[msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-update/](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-update/)**\n\n[As we said in our recent blog, we believe the Solorigate incident is an opportunity to work](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye)\ntogether in important ways, to share information, strengthen defenses and respond to\nattacks. Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of the\nSolorigate actor and want to share an update from our ongoing internal investigation.\n\nOur investigation into our own environment has found no evidence of access to\n**production services or customer data. The investigation, which is ongoing, has also**\n**found no indications that our systems were used to attack others.**\n\nAs we previously reported, we detected malicious SolarWinds applications in our\nenvironment, which we isolated and removed. Having investigated further, we can now report\nthat we have not found evidence of the common TTPs (tools, techniques and procedures)\nrelated to the abuse of forged SAML tokens against our corporate domains.\n\nOur investigation has, however, revealed attempted activities beyond just the presence of\nmalicious SolarWinds code in our environment. This activity has not put at risk the security of\nour services or any customer data, but we want to be transparent and share what we’re\nlearning as we combat what we believe is a very sophisticated nation-state actor.\n\nWe detected unusual activity with a small number of internal accounts and upon review, we\ndiscovered one account had been used to view source code in a number of source code\nrepositories. The account did not have permissions to modify any code or engineering\nsystems and our investigation further confirmed no changes were made. These accounts\nwere investigated and remediated.\n\nAt Microsoft, we have an [inner source approach – the use of open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source)\ndevelopment best practices and an open source-like culture – to making source code\nviewable within Microsoft. This means we do not rely on the secrecy of source code for the\nsecurity of products, and our threat models assume that attackers have knowledge of source\ncode. So viewing source code isn’t tied to elevation of risk.\n\nAs with many companies, we plan our security with an “assume breach” philosophy and\nlayer in defense-in-depth protections and controls to stop attackers sooner when they do\ngain access. We have found evidence of attempted activities which were thwarted by our\nprotections, so we want to re-iterate the value of industry best practices such as outlined\n[here, and implementing Privileged Access Workstations (PAW) as part of a strategy to](https://aka.ms/paw)\nprotect privileged accounts. We will provide additional updates if and when we discover new\ninformation to help inform and enable the community. As we learn more from our own\n\n\n-----\n\ninternal investigation, and from helping customers, we will continue to improve our security\nproducts and share these learnings with the community.
