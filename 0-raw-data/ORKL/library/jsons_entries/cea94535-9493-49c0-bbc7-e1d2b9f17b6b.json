    "plain_text": "# Emotet takedown is not like the Trickbot takedown\n\n**intel471.com/blog/emotet-takedown-2021**\n\nJan 27, 2021\n\n[On Wednesday, January 27, U.S. and European law enforcement agencies announced that](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\nthey had seized control of Emotet, the notorious botnet that’s been used by cybercriminals all\nover the world for the past decade.\n\nBased on the information available to Intel 471, the law enforcement operation took place\nJan. 26, 2021, resulting in the arrest of several Ukrainian nationals allegedly responsible for\nrunning the botnet’s infrastructure.\n\nOnly time will tell if the takedown will have a long-term impact on Emotet operations. The\ngroups who run these botnets are sophisticated and resilient, and will most likely have some\nsort of inherent recovery in place. Emotet itself does not appear to have any sort of recovery\nmechanism, but a lot of the infected machines will have other malware installed as well, such\n[as Qbot, Trickbot or something else. That could be leveraged to rein in the infected machines](https://intel471.com/blog/trickbot-update-november-2020-bazar-loader-microsoft/)\nand put them back under their control. Yet, right now, those bots are talking to servers\ncontrolled by the good guys.\n\nAdditionally, oftentimes groups like this tend to be composed of members spread across\ndifferent countries, some of which may not be so open to cooperating with international law\nenforcement. This leaves open the possibility that someone will simply take the code and\nrebuild.\n\nA rebuild or recovery won’t be hard to detect, however.\n\nThose scenarios aside, what was announced on Wednesday is very promising. The effort is a\nshining example of what needs to be done in order to have any real impact on these\norganized cybercrime groups. The difference between disruption and takedown boils down to\ncriminals being put in handcuffs. It’s the pinnacle of a takedown operation and the only way\nto have a long term impact on the health and safety of the internet.\n\n\n-----",
