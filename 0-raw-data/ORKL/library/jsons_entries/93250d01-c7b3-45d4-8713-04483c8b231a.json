These beacons are disguised as normal network packets,\nlikely directed at fake hosts, to be intercepted by intermediate infrastructure. The list in\nBLATSTING `beacon listening post module gives a possible list of disguises:`\n```\nFEINTCLOUD DNSDIRECT\nFEINTCLOUD HTTP1\nFEINTCLOUD NTP1\nFEINTCLOUD PING-2\nFEINTCLOUD PING_1_L\nFEINTCLOUD TCPSYN\n\n```\nBeaconing would be silly when a host is implanted though remote exploitation as the target\nIP and the topology of their network is obviously known.\n\nHowever I suppose that these are used when a host is implanted e.g. along the supply chain\nand it is unknown where it is going to end up on the network.\n\nIt would be interesting to look into this further to get an handle on which networks and hosts\nare infected. The above kinds of packets are typical ways to hide within a crowd on the\ninternet, but periodical announcements with certain properties may stick out.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FEINTCLOUD name doesn t seem to turn up anything on Google. Has anyone\nencountered this project in one of the Snowden documents? It vaguely rings familiar.\n\n_Edit 2016-09-04: it looks like BBANJO (BANANABANJO?) in the BANANAGLEE framework_\nis also a beaconing module, and various versions are available in the dump\n( Firewall/BANANAGLEE/*/Install/LP/Modules/PIX/BBANJO-* ). May be interesting to\nreverse-engineer to get more insight. Could be fairly straightforward as local symbols such\nas `obfuscate_payload1 are still present.`\n\nNote: I’m continuing work on reverse-engineering the BLATSTING rootkit and reporting [here.](https://gist.github.com/laanwj/9e5e404266a8956beabde522f97c421b)\n\nWritten on August 28, 2016\n\nTags: [eqgrp](https://laanwj.github.io/tags/#eqgrp) [malware](https://laanwj.github.io/tags/#malware)\n[Filed under Reverse-engineering](https://laanwj.github.io/categories/#reverse-engineering)\n\n\n-----",
