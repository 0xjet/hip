However, when multiple attacks\nare conducted over long periods of time, they leave a trail of digital evidence. Piecing this together\ninto a campaign can help investigators to see the bigger picture, and even hint at who may be\nbehind the attacks.\n\nOur [research into malware used on SWIFT based systems running in banks has turned up multiple](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2016/04/two-bytes-to-951m.html)\nbespoke tools used by a set of attackers. What initially looked to be an isolated incident at one Asian\nbank turned out to be part of a wider campaign. This led to the identification of a commercial bank in\nVietnam that also appears to have been targeted in a similar fashion using tailored malware, but\nbased off a common code-base.\n\nIn the bank malware cases we know of, the coders used a unique file wipe-out function. This\nimplementation was so distinctive that it further drew our attention – and so we began to look for\nother instances of code which had used the same function. Using disassembled machine opcodes\n(with masked out dynamic virtual addresses) we generated signatures to scan a large malware\ncorpus.\n\nOur initial search turned up an additional sample which implemented the same wipe-out function.\n\nThis sample was uploaded from a user in the US on 4th March 2016:\n\n\n-----\n\nSHA1 Compile\ntime\n\nc6eb8e46810f5806d056c4aa34e7b8d8a2c37cad 2014-10-24\n09:28:55\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe msoutc.exe functionality\n\n\nSize\n(bytes)\n\n\nName Country\n\n\n45,056 msoutc.exe US\n\n```\nmsoutc.exe accepts a number of parameters passed with the command line. When executed, it\n\n```\nchecks if there is another instance of itself already running on a system, by attempting to create a\nmutex called:\n```\nGlobal\\FwtSqmSession106839323_S-1-5-20\n\n```\nIf the mutex creation attempt fails, returning the 'already exists' error code, the bot will quit and\ndelete itself by executing a self-delete batch file. The bot then copies itself into a temporary directory\nas:\n```\n%TEMP%\\sysman\\svchost.exe\n\n```\nNext, it recreates its configuration file `wmplog09c.sqm in the same directory. As in case with the`\n[malware described in our blogpost, it will also install itself as a system service.](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2016/04/two-bytes-to-951m.html)\n\nThe service will be called \"Indman\", \"Indexing Manager\", and described as \"Provides fast indexing\n_service\"._\n\nThe malware keeps its logs within an encrypted file `wmplog15r.sqm and/or` `wmplog21t.sqm,`\nlocated in the same directory. The logged messages are encrypted with a key:\n```\ny@s!11yid60u7f!07ou74n001\n\n```\n[Back in 2015, PwC reported a malware with an identical encryption key as above and a very similar](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/01/destructive-malware.html)\nunique mutex name. The `msoutc.exe bot matches the description of other tools from the same`\ntoolkit, as described in the US CERT Alert TA14-353A:\n\nUS Cert Alert PwC msoutc.exe\n\n\nFwtSqmSession106829323_S-15-19\n\n\nFwtSqmSession106829323_S1-5-19\n\n\nFwtSqmSession106839323_S1-5-20\n\n\ny0uar3@s!llyid!07,ou74n60u7f001 y@s!11yid60u7f!07ou74n001 y@s!11yid60u7f!07ou74n001\n\nIf the configuration file is missing, the bot initiates a default configuration and saves it to the\n```\nwmplog09c.sqm file, located in the same directory. The default parameters specify 127.0.0.1 (local\n\n```\nhost) and port 443 as the default address for the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, the bot expects the C&C server s IP address and port number to be passed as the\ncommand line parameters. These parameters are then used to update the configuration file.\n\nSince the configuration file is not available for analysis, the C&C IP remains unknown, but the port\nnumber is likely to be 443, same as the default value.\n\nEvery 5 minutes it initiates a communication to the remote C&C. All communications are encrypted.\nThe beacon signal it sends contains the local IP address. The data it receives from the C&C is first\ndecrypted, and then used to update its own executable and the `wmplog09c.sqm configuration file.`\nThe updated executable may have additional functionality that is missing in the analysed sample.\n\nThe msoutc.exe 'wipe-out' and 'file-delete' functions\n\nWhen the malware reaches out to the C&C server, it may receive a special instruction to terminate\nitself. In that case, it uninstalls its service, deletes its configuration and log files, then quits and\ndeletes itself by executing a self-delete batch file that has the following format:\n\n.data:0040A400 echoOffD1Del db '@echo off',0Dh,0Ah\n.data:0040A400       db ':D1',0Dh,0Ah\n.data:0040A400       db 'del /a %1',0Dh,0Ah\n.data:0040A400       db 'if exist %1 goto D1',0Dh,0Ah\n.data:0040A400       db 'del /a %0',0\n\n[The batch file format is identical to the one previously reported by Novetta.](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\n\nIn order to delete its configuration and log files, the bot calls an internal function that wipes these\nfiles out so that their contents cannot be forensically restored.\n\nThe implementation of this function is very unique - it involves complete filling of the file with the\nrandom data in order to occupy all associated disk sectors, before the file is deleted. The file-delete\nfunction itself is also unique – the file is first renamed into a temporary file with a random name, and\nthat temporary file is also deleted.\n\n\n-----\n\nLet s compare the wipe-out function employed by this bot to the wipe-out function within the malware\nthat was involved in the operation against the bank in Vietnam.\n\nMachine Opcode Disassembled Code\n\n```\nB8 20 10 00 00\nE8 96 EA 04 00\n53\n55\n57\nFF 15 4C F0 45 00\n...\n\n```\n```\nmov   eax, 1020h\ncall  __alloca_probe\npush  ebx\npush  ebp\npush  edi\ncall  ds:GetTickCount\n...\n\n```\n\nThe first instruction is to assign `0x1020 to` `EAX - this instruction is represented with an opcode`\n```\nB8 20 10 00 00, and it stays the same across the compared samples.\n\n```\nThe second instruction is to call a function located at the address calculated as the address of the\nnext instruction ( push ebx ) plus `0x4EA96 . Depending on a sample, the compiler may place`\n___alloca_probe() function at a different offset within the executable, hence the_ `0x4EA96 offset is`\ndynamic and the opcode bytes `96 EA 04 (representing` `0x4EA96 ) should be ignored in our`\ncomparison.\n\nThe API GetTickCount() is called with the last instruction, but again, the pointer into the API is stored\nin this particular sample at the virtual address of `0x45F04C . In a modified sample with a different`\nimage base, the virtual address of this pointer will also be different. Hence, the bytes `4C F0 45`\n(representing `0x45F04C ) should also be masked out (ignored).`\n\nUsing this principle, full comparison of this function's implementation can now be done.\n\nAs it turns out, the wipe-out function employed by this bot is byte-to-byte identical to wipe-out\nfunction within the malware that was involved in the operation against the bank in Vietnam, as\nshown below:\n\n\nWipe-out function\n(msoutc.exe, 2014)\n\n\nWipe-out function\n(Vietnam malware, 2015)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nB820100000E8B64E0000535557FF1500\n90400050FF154C90400083C404C64424\n0CFFFF156890400025FF000080790748\n0D00FFFFFF408844240DB9FF03000033\nC08D7C242DC644242C5F33DBF3AB66AB\n5368800000006A0353AA8B8424401000\n0053680000004050C644242AFF885C24\n2BC644242C7EC644242DE7FF15A4AC40\n008BE883FDFF7510FF151C9040005F5D\n5B81C420100000C3566A02536AFF55FF\n15D4AC40008D4C242453518D5424386A\n015255FF15ACAC400055FF15C8AC4000\n8D44241C5055FF15D0AC400033F68974\n24188B84243810000083F8067E05B806\n0000003BF00F8DC900000053535355FF\n15D4AC40008A4434103CFF75148D4C24\n30680010000051E8C4FDFFFF83C408EB\n1C25FF000000B9000400008AD08D7C24\n308AF28BC2C1E010668BC2F3AB8B4424\n208B4C241C33FF33F63BC37C607F0A3B\nCB765AEB048B4C241C2BCF1BC678157F\n0881F900100000760BB900100000895C\n242CEB048944242C8D4424245350518D\n4C243C5155FF15ACAC400085C0741E8B\n4424243BC3741603F88B44242013F33B\nF07CB27F088B4C241C3BF972AC55FF15\nC8AC40008B44241840894424188BF0E9\n1EFFFFFF55FF15A8AC40008B94243410\n00005352E847FDFFFF83C4085E5F5D5B\n81C420100000C3\n\n```\n```\nB820100000E896EA0400535557FF154C\nF0450050FF152CF1450083C404C64424\n0CFFFF1524F1450025FF000080790748\n0D00FFFFFF408844240DB9FF03000033\nC08D7C242DC644242C5F33DBF3AB66AB\n5368800000006A0353AA8B8424401000\n0053680000004050C644242AFF885C24\n2BC644242C7EC644242DE7FF1548F045\n008BE883FDFF7510FF1508F045005F5D\n5B81C420100000C3566A02536AFF55FF\n1544F045008D4C242453518D5424386A\n015255FF1540F0450055FF153CF04500\n8D44241C5055FF1538F0450033F68974\n24188B84243810000083F8067E05B806\n0000003BF00F8DC900000053535355FF\n1544F045008A4434103CFF75148D4C24\n30680010000051E8C4FDFFFF83C408EB\n1C25FF000000B9000400008AD08D7C24\n308AF28BC2C1E010668BC2F3AB8B4424\n208B4C241C33FF33F63BC37C607F0A3B\nCB765AEB048B4C241C2BCF1BC678157F\n0881F900100000760BB900100000895C\n242CEB048944242C8D4424245350518D\n4C243C5155FF1540F0450085C0741E8B\n4424243BC3741603F88B44242013F33B\nF07CB27F088B4C241C3BF972AC55FF15\n3CF045008B44241840894424188BF0E9\n1EFFFFFF55FF1510F045008B94243410\n00005352E847FDFFFF83C4085E5F5D5B\n81C420100000C3\n\n```\n\nNOTE: the greyed-out areas correspond to the virtual addresses of the called APIs – these\naddresses would not be expected to be constant across different samples, and hence, should be\nignored.\n\nThe wipe-out function used in the Bangladesh malware case was slightly different: the author\nremoved one outer loop from the writing into the file, and one randomisation layer, as shown below.\nHowever, the core of the function was left intact.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of the file writing, the wipe-out function makes a call to a file-delete function that removes\nthe file/directory – this is named removeFileDir() in our reconstructed code.\n\nThis function is implemented identically in all the analysed samples, up to the last character. It’s very\ndistinctive as the file is first renamed into a random filename in the same directory, and then deleted,\nas shown below in the reconstructed code:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n\n```\n```\nDWORD removeFileDir(LPCSTR lpExistingFileName, bool bDir) \n{\nconst CHAR *_filePath;\nchar *backslash;\nchar *fileName;\nchar next_char;\nchar _filepath;\nchar buf;\n_filepath = 0;\n_filePath = lpExistingFileName;\nmemset(&buf, 0, 0x100u);\nstrcpy(&_filepath, lpExistingFileName);\nbackslash = strrchr(&_filepath, '\\\\');\nif (backslash)\nfileName = backslash + 1;\nelse\nfileName = &_filepath;\nif (*fileName)\n{\ndo\n{\n*fileName = rand() % 26 + 'a';\nnext_char = (fileName++)[1];\n}\nwhile ( next_char );\n}\nif (MoveFileA(lpExistingFileName, &_filepath))\n_filePath = &_filepath;\nif (bDir)\n{\nif (!RemoveDirectoryA(_filePath))\nreturn GetLastError();\n}\nelse if (!DeleteFileA(_filePath))\n{\nreturn GetLastError();\n}\nreturn 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nATTRIBUTION\n\nSo what else do we know about `msoutc.exe ? It turns out that this malware exhibits the same`\nunique characteristics, such as mutex names and encryption keys, as other tools from a larger\ntoolkit [described in US-CERT Alert TA14-353A.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-353A)\n\nThe US-CERT alert mentions \"a major entertainment company\" and is widely believed to describe\nthe toolkit used to conduct destructive cyber-attack which took place in late 2014. Further details of\n[this same toolkit were disclosed in the 'Op Blockbuster' report in February 2016.](http://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\n```\nmsoutc.exe matches the description of the 'Sierra Charlie' variants in their report. From their\n\n```\nanalysis this is described as a spreader type of malware, presumably used to gain a foothold on\nmultiple devices within a target environment before launching further actions.\n\nSummarising the overlaps:\n\n\n-----\n\nTypos\n\nTypos are not uncommon in cyber-attacks, as developers and operators rush through their tasks in\nan effort to stay ahead of network-defenders. However, this provides another soft link across the\ndifferent sets of activity.\n\nInstance Comment\n\n\nOperation Blockbuster\ncampaign\n\n\n[The Kaspersky Labs team noted a typo in the User-Agent of](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/73914/operation-blockbuster-revealed/)\n'Mozillar' instead of 'Mozilla'\n\n\nVietnam case Attacker code featured the string 'FilleOut' instead of 'FileOut'\n\nBangladesh case Attacker code featured the string 'alreay' instead of 'already'\n\nAttacker [mis-spelled 'foundation'](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-bangladesh-typo-insight-idUSKCN0WC0TC)\nas 'fandation'\n\nDevelopment environment\n\nThe coder makes exclusive use of Visual C++ 6.0, an older development environment released in\n1998. The use of such infrastructure for development is not unheard of, but it does leave a\ndistinctive tool-mark with which to link the malware samples.\n\n[The use of this compiler was also noted in the 'Kordllbot' samples described in a recent report by](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2016-02-24/seoul-sony)\nBlueCoat. This report details the same activity as discussed in the Operation Blockbuster reports.\n\nInstance Comment\n\nKordllbot malware (BlueCoat report / Op Blockbuster) Noted to have used Visual C++ 6.0\n\nVietnam case Malware compiled in Visual C++ 6.0\n\nBangladesh case Malware compiled in Visual C++ 6.0\n\nFile-wipe / file-delete functionality\n\nAs noted already, the developers coded a specific function for securely erasing files from disk. The\nauthor of this function took great care in writing a large amount of random data into a file, before\npassing it to a file delete command. This was done in order to make sure the deleted file could not\nbe forensically restored as all the original contents of the hard disk sectors associated with the file\nwould be lost.\n\nInstance Comment\n\nOperation Blockbuster campaign Described under the 'Secure File Delete' section\n\n\n-----\n\n`msoutc.exe` Contains both 'file-wipe' and 'file-delete' functions\n\nVietnam case Contains identical functions to the above sample\n\nBangladesh case Contains modified 'file-wipe' but identical 'file-delete' function\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe overlaps between these samples provide strong links for the same coder being behind the\nrecent bank heist cases and a wider known campaign stretching back almost a decade.\n\nIt is possible that this particular file-delete function exists as shared code, distributed between\nmultiple coders who look to achieve similar results. However, we have noted that this code isn't\npublically available or present in any other software after searching through tens of millions of files.\nThe unique decision to move and rename the file before deletion after overwriting is unusual, and\nnot a common step we would expect to see when implementing this capability.\n\nA motivated and talented coder could implement the same function and choose to compile their\nproject in Visual Studio 6.0 to achieve the same binary result for the purposes of misattribution. We\ncannot prove for certain that this is not the case, and further investigation of command infrastructure\nand related tools is needed before any definitive statements on attribution can be made.\n\nWhilst there are possibilities that exist which may lead to alternative hypotheses, these are unlikely\nand as such, we believe that the same coder is central to these attacks. Who the coder is, who they\nwork for, and what their motivation is for conducting these attacks cannot be determined from the\ndigital evidence alone. However, this adds a significant lead to the investigation.\n\n\n-----",
