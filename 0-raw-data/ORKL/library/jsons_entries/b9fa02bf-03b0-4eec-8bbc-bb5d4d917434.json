Alongside revealing these vulnerabilities, Microsoft](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065)\n[published security updates and technical guidance that stressed the importance of patching](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/released-march-2021-exchange-server-security-updates/ba-p/2175901)\nimmediately, while concurrently noting active and ongoing exploitation by an Advanced\n[Persistent Threat (APT) they call HAFNIUM. Since the initial attacks, Unit 42 and a number](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/)\nof other threat intelligence teams have seen multiple threat groups now exploiting these zeroday vulnerabilities in the wild. Both the vulnerabilities themselves and the access that can be\nachieved by exploiting them are significant. It is therefore unsurprising that multiple\nattackers sought and continue to seek to compromise vulnerable systems before they are\npatched by network administrators. This has been going on at an unprecedented scale – as of\nMarch 8, based on telemetry collected from the Palo Alto Networks Expanse platform, we\nestimated there remained over 125,000 unpatched Exchange Servers in the world.\n\nBased on the reconstructed timeline, it’s now clear that there were at least 58 days between\nthe first known exploitation of this vulnerability on Jan. 3 and when Microsoft released the\npatch on March 2. Applying the patch is a necessary first step, but insufficient given the\namount of time the exploit was in the wild. The act of patching will not remediate any access\nthat attackers may have already gained to vulnerable systems. Organizations can look to our\n[remediation guide for steps they can take to ensure they have properly secured their](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/remediation-steps-for-the-microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/)\nExchange Servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we enter the second week since the vulnerabilities became public, initial estimates place\nthe number of compromised organizations in the tens of thousands, thereby dwarfing the\n[impact of the recent SolarStorm supply chain attack in terms of victims and estimated](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-supply-chain-attack-timeline/)\nremediation costs globally. Given the importance of this event, we are publishing a timeline\nof the attack based on our extensive research into the information currently available to us\nand our direct experience defending against these attacks. As the situation continues to\nunfold, we urge others to also share what they uncover so that we as a cybersecurity\ncommunity get a complete picture as quickly as possible.\n\n## Microsoft Exchange Server Attack Timeline Summary\n\n[This story begins over six months ago when DevCore, a Taiwan-based security consulting](https://proxylogon.com/#timeline)\nfirm, first initiated a project to explore the security of Microsoft Exchange Server products. In\nthe two-month window between October and December 2020, DevCore researchers made\nconsiderable progress that ultimately led to the discovery of a pre-authentication proxy\nvulnerability on Dec. 10, 2020. This vulnerability was given the name ProxyLogon by\nDevCore and is now known publicly as CVE-2021-26855.\n\nFollowing this initial discovery, on Dec. 27, 2020, DevCore researchers demonstrated that\nthis vulnerability could be leveraged to perform authentication bypass, thereby granting its\nusers administrator-level permissions on vulnerable Exchange Servers. Shortly after this\ndiscovery, on Dec. 30, 2020, DevCore also discovered a second post-authentication file write\nbug that could be chained together with the first vulnerability to gain privileged access to\nExchange Servers and write files of an attacker’s choosing to any directory. This second\nvulnerability is now known publicly as CVE-2021-27065.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the time of year and the existence of a long New Year s holiday weekend, DevCore\nreached out and notified Microsoft of the vulnerabilities on the following Tuesday (Jan. 5,\n2021). At the time, the researcher credited with the discovery of the vulnerabilities tweeted\npublicly.\n\nAt that point, attacks were already appearing in the wild. Volexity, a US-based security firm,\n[reported attacks involving the ProxyLogon vulnerability as early as Jan. 3. On Feb. 2, the firm](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/)\nalso reported to Microsoft information about attacks that occurred on Jan. 6.\n\n[Concurrently, it is now believed that Dubex, a Denmark-based security firm, first noted](https://www.dubex.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/hafnium-attack-dubex-recommendations)\nactive exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange UMWorkerProcess on Jan. 18, 2021. This\nvulnerability is now known as CVE-2021-26857. It was used by an adversary to install\nwebshells on vulnerable servers consistent with the attacks noted by Volexity. It has been\n[reported that Dubex notified Microsoft of its findings on Jan. 27, less than 10 days after](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/a-basic-timeline-of-the-exchange-mass-hack/)\ninitial discovery.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith two cybersecurity vendors providing evidence of active exploitation, DevCore followed\nup with Microsoft on Feb. 18, 2021. During the exchange, DevCore provided a draft advisory\nnotice and requested details concerning the patch release timeline. At the time, Microsoft\nshared that they planned to release the patches on March 9.\n\nOn Feb. 27, 2021 Microsoft notified DevCore that they were almost ready to release the\nsecurity patches. That same day, the cybersecurity community observed an uptick in unusual\nwebshell activity, and over the following two days, evidence suggests multiple threat groups\n[began active exploitation activities. ESET reported three separate groups (Tick, LuckyMouse](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\n[and Calypso) and our own analysis of webshells deployed in this window has identified six](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/china-chopper-webshell/)\nunique passwords and clusters of activity that further support the claim of multiple threat\ngroups. It is also worth noting that one of the passwords observed on Feb. 28, 2021 was the\nname “orange,” which may serve as a reference to the researcher who originally discovered\nthe vulnerability.\n\n[On March 2, 2021, a week earlier than initially planned, Microsoft published security updates](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\nfor the four vulnerabilities. In doing so, they also warned of active exploitation of these\nvulnerabilities by a group they named HAFNIUM and further described as a state-sponsored\nAPT operating out of China.\n\nIn the days following the publication of the CVEs, the cybersecurity community has\nwitnessed a surge of attacks as malicious actors seek to capitalize on the vulnerabilities\nbefore network defenders deploy patches. Over the past week, we have also identified the\nemergence of several new webshell passwords and clusters of activity that have overlapping\nvictim populations. Thus, we currently assess that several additional threat actors with\nvarying motives have launched efforts to exploit these vulnerabilities as well.\n\nFinally, in terms of the timeline, it is important to consider that while the Microsoft security\nupdates were released on March 2, 2021, applying these updates only protects organizations\nfrom continued or future exploitation of these vulnerabilities. The security updates do not\nprovide any protection from previous exploitation that may have resulted in compromise\nprior to the publication of the updates.\n\nAs documented above, there is definitive evidence that these exploits were in active use as far\nback as early January, thus resulting in at least a two-month window of vulnerability.\nHowever, a lack of evidence of exploitation prior to January should not be misinterpreted as\na lack of adversary activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. High-level timeline of activity\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOngoing research illustrates that these vulnerabilities are being used by multiple threat\ngroups. While it is not new for highly skilled attackers to leverage new vulnerabilities across\nvarying product ecosystems, the ways in which these attacks are conducted to bypass\nauthentication -- thereby providing unauthorized access to emails and enabling remote code\nexecution (RCE) -- is particularly nefarious.\n\nUnit 42 fully expects attacks leveraging these vulnerabilities to not only continue, but to\nincrease in scope, likely including more varied attacks with different motivations, such as\nransomware infection and/or distribution. Due to the fact that active attacks from various\nthreat groups leveraging these vulnerabilities is ongoing, it’s imperative to not only patch\naffected systems, but also follow the guidance outlined from Unit 42’s previous remediation\nblog.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n**Get updates from Palo Alto Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
