    "plain_text": "# Microsoft Links Raspberry Robin USB Worm to Russian Evil Corp Hackers\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-links-raspberry-robin-usb.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/microsoft-links-raspberry-robin-usb.html?_m=3n%2e009a%2e2800%2ejp0ao0cjb8%2e1shm)**\n\nJuly 30, 2022\n\nMicrosoft on Friday disclosed a potential connection between the Raspberry Robin USBbased worm and an infamous Russian cybercrime group tracked as Evil Corp.\n\n[The tech giant said it observed the FakeUpdates (aka SocGholish) malware being delivered](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/#DEV-0206-DEV-0243)\nvia existing Raspberry Robin infections on July 26, 2022.\n\nRaspberry Robin, also called QNAP Worm, is [known to spread from a compromised system](https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/researchers-warn-of-raspberry-robins.html)\nvia infected USB devices containing malicious a .LNK files to other devices in the target\nnetwork.\n\nThe campaign, which was first spotted by Red Canary in September 2021, has been elusive\nin that no later-stage activity has been documented nor has there been any concrete link\ntying it to a known threat actor or group.\n\nThe disclosure, therefore, marks the first evidence of post-exploitation actions carried out by\nthe threat actor upon leveraging the malware to gain initial access to a Windows machine.\n\n\"The DEV-0206-associated FakeUpdates activity on affected systems has since led to followon actions resembling DEV-0243 pre-ransomware behavior,\" Microsoft noted.\n\n\n-----\n\nDEV-0206 is Redmond's moniker for an initial access broker that deploys a malicious\nJavaScript framework called FakeUpdates by enticing targets into downloading fake browser\nupdates in the form of ZIP archives.\n\nThe malware, at its core, acts as a conduit for other campaigns that make use of this access\npurchased from DEV-0206 to distribute other payloads, primarily Cobalt Strike loaders\nattributed to DEV-0243, which is also known as Evil Corp.\n\nReferred to as Gold Drake and Indrik Spider, the financially motivated hacking group has\nhistorically operated the Dridex malware and has since switched to deploying a string of\n[ransomware families over the years, including most recently LockBit.](https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/evil-corp-cybercrime-group-shifts-to.html)\n\n\"The use of a RaaS payload by the 'Evil Corp' activity group is likely an attempt by DEV-0243\nto avoid attribution to their group, which could discourage payment due to their sanctioned\nstatus,\" Microsoft said.\n\nIt's not immediately clear what exact connections Evil Corp, DEV-0206, and DEV-0243 may\nhave with one another.\n\nKatie Nickels, director of intelligence at Red Canary, said in a statement shared with The\nHacker News that the findings, if proven to be correct, fill a \"major gap\" with Raspberry\nRobin's modus operandi.\n\n\"We continue to see Raspberry Robin activity, but we have not been able to associate it with\nany specific person, company, entity, or country,\" Nickels said.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's too early to say if Evil Corp is responsible for, or associated with, Raspberry\nRobin. The Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) ecosystem is a complex one, where different\ncriminal groups partner with one another to achieve a variety of objectives. As a result, it can\n\n\n-----\n\nbe difficult to untangle the relationships between malware families and observed activity.\n\nSHARE __ __ __ __ __\nSHARE __\n\n\n-----",
