We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of\nthe North Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns\nwith North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is aligned\n[with the activity publicly reported as Scarcruft and Group123.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/01/korea-in-crosshairs.html)\n\n[Read our report, APT37 (Reaper): The Overlooked North Korean Actor, to learn more about](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt_APT37.pdf)\nour assessment that this threat actor is working on behalf of the North Korean government,\nas well as various other details about their operations:\n\n**Targeting: Primarily South Korea – though also Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East –**\nin various industry verticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing,\naerospace, automotive, and healthcare.\n**Initial Infection Tactics: Social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired**\ntargets, strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations,\nand the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware more indiscriminately.\n**Exploited Vulnerabilities: Frequent exploitation of vulnerabilities in Hangul Word**\nProcessor (HWP), as well as Adobe Flash. The group has demonstrated access to\nzero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802), and the ability to incorporate them into\noperations.\n**Command and Control Infrastructure: Compromised servers, messaging platforms,**\nand cloud service providers to avoid detection. The group has shown increasing\nsophistication by improving their operational security over time.\n**Malware: A diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Along with**\ncustom malware used for espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive\nmalware.\n\nMore information on this threat actor is found in our report, APT37 (Reaper): The Overlooked\n_[North Korean Actor. You can also register for our upcoming webinar for additional insights](https://www.fireeye.com/WBNR-APT37-Overlooked-North-Korean-Threat.html)_\ninto this group.\n\n**[Download Now](https://www.fireeye.com/media/11376/download)**\n\n\n-----",
