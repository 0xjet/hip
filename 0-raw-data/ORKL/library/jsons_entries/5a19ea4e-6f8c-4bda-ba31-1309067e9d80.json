Our research paper and upcoming BlackHat\nEurope presentation – EGO MARKET: When People’s Greed for Fame Benefits Large-Scale\nBotnets – is about Linux/Moose, a botnet that conducts social media fraud. This blog post is\na summary of [our paper.](http://gosecure.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ego-Market_When-Greed-for-Fame-Benefits-Large-Scale-Botnets.pdf)\n\nThrough our technical/social investigation, we found that the botnet is involved in a clever\nscheme that combines a stealthy infrastructure, constant technological adaptation, the\ninconspicuous activity of social media fraud with no direct victims, the ability to hide in plain\nsight and a large potential for profitability.\n\nSocial media fraud is:\n\nThe process of creating false endorsements of social networks accounts in order to\nenhance a user’s popularity and visibility. This can be achieved by liking posts (or any\nsimilar endorsement) or following a user.\n\nThe clever scheme of Linux/Moose:\n\n## Stealthy\n\n\n-----\n\nLinux/Moose only targets IoT devices. The lack of antivirus and security software available\nfor these devices allows the botnet to spread undetected. Moreover, the botnet is an\nembedded system threat with no x86 architecture variant; it can only run on embedded\nLinux systems of the MIPS and ARM architectures. This focus on embedded systems is rare\nas even the well-known embedded threats like LizardStresser (Linux/Gafgyt) and the\nrecently discovered Mirai have x86 variants.\n\nSince our industry’s best tools are built to detect and clean x86 threats, we can only deduce\nthat the botnet operators aimed to proactively stay under the radar.\n\n## Constantly Adapting\n\nThe Linux/Moose botnet was first discovered by the ESET research team in 2015 and their\n[analysis of the botnet was published in a technical report. The botnet’s infrastructure](http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dissecting-LinuxMoose.pdf)\nchanged following the report, illustrating how offenders can adapt once their activities are\nexposed.\n\nLinux/Moose Adaptations\n\n1 changest The IP address of the C&C server is now XORed with a static value and\npassed as an argument into the executables instead of hard-coded in binary\nfiles. This means that out-of-context hunting by gathering files from Virus\nTotal (VT) is no longer a viable means to track the botnet.\n\n\n2nd change The SOCKSv4 TCP port used by the botnet operators to proxy their traffic\nwas updated from 10073 to 20012.\n\n\n3 changerd Bot enrollment process changed and a correlation check was integrated\nbetween the infecting party and the victim in the C&C server. Simply\nmimicking an infected device and contacting the C&C is no longer sufficient\nto be considered as a bot by the botnet.\n\n4 changeth The network protocol with the C&C server was updated. The new protocol\nnow mimics HTTP traffic on port 80 and the server displays a very common\n“It works!” page.\n\n[These changes are further described in a blog post released by ESET.](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/11/02/linuxmoose-still-breathing/)\n\n**Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Linux/Moose**\n\n\n-----\n\nTo further study the real effect of this botnet on social networks, we needed to see the\ntraffic proxied by Linux/Moose’s infected devices. To do so, we built a custom honeypot,\ndeployed it worldwide and conducted an HTTPS man-in-the-middle attack on the proxied\ntraffic. The complete description of the honeypot’s architecture and the TLS attacks\nconducted are presented in the report.\n\nThe attack gave us invaluable information on the botnet’s activities, such as which social\nmedia sites were targeted, as well as detailed information about all the requests made on\neach site.\n\n## No Direct Victims\n\nBotnets are commonly known for distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), sending spam\nor contributing to ad click fraud. We found that the Linux/Moose botnet operators are\nbranching out to new and less risky activities. All of Linux/Moose’s traffic aims at social\nmedia fraud. This was achieved by sending requests to log in on the social networks, create\nfake accounts and endorse other accounts. The most common fraud conducted by\nLinux/Moose is following a user on Instagram.\n\nDistribution of Linux/Moose traffic on different social media websites\nAs opposed to Ransomware, Social media fraud does not generate victims in need of\n**defending. Thus it is not an attractive target for law enforcement or for the international**\nsecurity industry. The indirect victims of social media fraud are the entities or people that use\nthe number of followers and likes as a measure of the worth of a profile to hire a person, buy\nproducts from the profile or pay for advertisements. Instead of requiring law enforcement\nintervention, these victims are more likely to be more cautious in future transactions, thereby\n**giving a free pass to the botnet operators.**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nThe Linux/Moose botnet operators can advertise on the clear Web, reaching large\n**exposure. Indeed, most sales of social media fraud go through websites and freelancer**\nplatforms available through an easy search on Google. The price on Instagram is, on\naverage, US $112.67 for 10,000 follows. This is expensive considering that fake follows\nfrom Linux/Moose do not last. The fake accounts are often quickly flagged as spam by\nInstagram.\n\nThe nature of the demand shows how the fraud\nis driven by an EGO Market. Not only are the\nLinux/Moose operators selling their illegal\nactivity in plain sight, they reach a pool of\n**customers that are not criminalized.**\n\nThe buyers of social media fraud found in\nLinux/Moose traffic are mostly small\nbusinesses, aspiring celebrities, and common people. Businesses centered around\nindividuals, such as the adjacent profile showing a corporate account focused on the owner,\nwere often found.\n\n## Large Potential Profitability\n\nWith a large botnet and all follows monetized, the operators of Linux/Moose are sitting on\n**a gold mine, as shown in the graph below. Indeed, if all follows conducted by Linux/Moose**\non Instagram are monetized, the value generated by a single bot can go up to, on average,\n13.05$ per month. However, to what extent the fraud is profitable for the botnet operators\nremains unclear. It depends on several factors such as the number of follows monetized, the\nsize of the botnet and the number of actors sharing the money.\n\n\n-----\n\nRegardless of the botnet’s overall profitability, the Linux/Moose botnet evolves in an\ninconspicuous EGO market collecting money from normal people using regular credit cards.\nFurther, it advertises its services on the clear Web and does not attract the attention of law\nenforcement. No connection to the criminal underworld is needed and there are no direct\nvictims, yet the money is generated through illicit activities.\n\nIn the end, the Linux/Moose botnet participates in a clever scheme: it falls into an interstice\nthat allows the botnet operators to continuously commit a cybercrime and profit from it in total\nimpunity.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs) are available in the appendix section of the report and from\nthe [ESET IoC repository.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/moose)\n\n[Our full research paper is available here.](http://gosecure.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ego-Market_When-Greed-for-Fame-Benefits-Large-Scale-Botnets.pdf)\n\n_This research was partially financed by the MITACS Accelerate Program, under Project N._\n_IT06861.
