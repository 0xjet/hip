We also observed YoroTrooper compromise accounts from at least\ntwo international organizations: a critical European Union (EU) health care agency\nand the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Successful compromises\nalso included Embassies of European countries including Azerbaijan and\nTurkmenistan. We assess the actor also likely targets other organizations across\nEurope and Turkish (Türkiye) government agencies.\n\n\n-----\n\nInformation stolen from successful compromises include credentials from multiple\napplications, browser histories & cookies, system information and screenshots.\n\nYoroTrooper’s main tools include Python-based, custom-built and open-source\n[information stealers, such as the Stink stealer wrapped into executables via the Nuitka](https://github.com/FallenAstaroth/stink?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\nframework and [PyInstaller. For remote access, YoroTrooper has also deployed](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\ncommodity malware, such as AveMaria/Warzone RAT, LodaRAT and Meterpreter.\n\nThe infection chain consists of malicious shortcut files (LNKs) and optional decoy\ndocuments wrapped in malicious archives delivered to targets. The actor appears\nintent on exfiltrating documents and other information, likely for use in future\noperations.\n\n## Introducing YoroTrooper\n\nThis new threat actor we are naming “YoroTrooper” has been targeting governments across\nEastern Europe since at least June 2022, and Cisco Talos has found three different activity\nclusters with overlapping infrastructure that are all linked to the same threat actor. Cisco\nTalos does not have a full overview of this threat actor, as we were able to collect varying\namounts of detail in each campaign. In some cases, for instance, we were able to fully\nprofile a campaign, while in other cases, we only identified the infrastructure or\ncompromised data.\n\nOur assessment is that the operators of this threat actor are Russian language speakers,\nbut not necessarily living in Russia or Russian nationals since their victimology consists\nmostly of countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). There are also\nsnippets of Cyrillic in some of their implants, indicating that the actor is familiar with the\nlanguage. Also, in some cases, the attackers are targeting Russian language endpoints\n(with Code Page 866), indicating a targeting of individuals speaking that specific language.\n\n\n-----\n\nEspionage is the main motivation for this threat actor, according to the tactics, techniques\nand procedures (TTPs) we have analyzed. To trick their victims, the threat actor either\nregisters malicious domains and then generates subdomains or registers typo-squatted\ndomains similar to legitimate domains from CIS entities to host malicious artifacts. The table\nbelow contains some of the domains created by this actor.\n\n**Malicious subdomain** **Legitimate domain** **Entity**\n\nmail[.]mfa[.]gov[.]kg[.]openingfile[.]net mfa[.]gov[.]kg Kyrgyzstan’s\nMinistry of Foreign\nAffairs\n\nakipress[.]news akipress[.]com AKI Press News\nAgency\n(Kyrgyzstanbased)\n\nmaileecommission[.]inro[.]link commission[.]europa[.]eu European\nCommission’s\nemail\n\nsts[.]mfa[.]gov[.]tr[.]mypolicy[.]top mfa[.]gov[.]tr Turkey’s Ministry\nof Foreign Affairs\n\nindustry[.]tj[.]mypolicy[.]top industry[.]tj Tajikistan’s\nMinistry of\nIndustry and New\nTechnologies\n\nmail[.]mfa[.]az-link[.]email mail[.]mfa[.]az Azerbaijan’s\nMinistry of Foreign\nAffairs\n\nbelaes[.]by[.]authentication[.]becloud[.]cc belaes[.]by Belarusian\nNuclear Power\nPlant (Astravets)\n\nbelstat[.]gov[.]by[.]attachment-posts[.]cc belstat[.]gov[.]by National Statistical\nCommittee of\nBelarus\n\nminsk[.]gov[.]by[.]attachment-posts[.]cc minsk[.]gov[.]by Official Website of\nthe Government of\nMinsk (Belarus)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial attack vectors are phishing emails with a file attached, which usually consists of\nan archive consisting of two files: a shortcut file and a decoy PDF file. The shortcut file is\nthe initial trigger for the infection, while the PDF is the lure to make the infection look\nlegitimate. The full details of the campaigns are detailed in the section below.\n\nPhishing email example.\n\nRegarding YoroTrooper’s toolset, the actor uses several commodity remote access trojans\n(RAT) and credential stealers. For RATs, we have seen the usage of AveMaria/Warzone\nRAT, LodaRAT, and a custom-built implant based on Python. Credential stealers used by\nYoroTrooper are either custom scripts, which in some cases are based on the open-sourced\n[Lazagne project or commodity stealers such as the Stink Stealer. All the Python-based](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/blob/b1289b8f69d41356d85403c6ecefc569588b3a68/Linux/lazagne/softwares/browsers/chromium_based.py?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\nmalware used in the campaign is wrapped up into an executable using frameworks such as\nNuitka or PyInstaller. The custom implants (stealers and RATs) use Telegram bots to\nexfiltrate information or receive commands from the operator.\n\n## Successful infections and breaches by YoroTrooper\n\nOur analysis has shown that YoroTrooper successfully obtained access to credentials of at\nleast one account from a critical EU health care agency’s internet-exposed system and\n[another from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). However, it is unclear if](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\nthe threat actors targeted these institutions specifically via such phishing domains or if the\ncredentials were compromised because they belong to users from a specific list of targeted\ncountries in Europe. We found malicious domains masquerading as those of legitimate\nEuropean Union government agencies, such as “maileecommission[.]inro[.]link”, which\nindicates that other European institutions were targeted.\n\nYoroTrooper also successfully compromised embassies belonging to Turkmenistan and\nAzerbaijan, where the operators attempted to exfiltrate documents of interest and deploy\nadditional malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nTypically, YoroTrooper employs information stealers and RATs. An analysis of their stolen\ndata reveals a treasure trove of information stolen from infected endpoints, such as\ncredentials, histories and cookies for multiple browsers. Information such as credentials is\nhighly valuable as they may be used either during lateral movement efforts or during\nsubsequent YoroTrooper campaigns. Browsing histories can be used by a threat actor to\nspecifically target victims with phishing lures based on their browsing habits.\n\n## YoroTrooper affiliation assessment\n\n[While attribution can be difficult, we assess that there are no relevant overlaps between](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/attribution-puzzle/)\n[YoroTrooper and Kasablanka, the group behind the development of LodaRat4Android. Our](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/kasablanka-lodarat/)\nanalysis on Kasablanka in 2021 was that the operators might be different from the\ndevelopers, which we can now confirm.\n\nThe overlaps with the PoetRAT team are stronger, especially on non-technical aspects of\nthe campaigns but there are not enough for us to link them even with a low confidence\n[level. Cisco Talos discovered the PoetRAT team in 2020 during a series of campaigns that](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/poetrat-update/)\nsuccessfully compromised Azerbaijan embassies and other government agencies.\n\n## PoetRAT team and YoroTropper share victimology and TTPs\n\nWhile there are no concrete links between operators of PoetRAT and YoroTrooper, such as\ninfrastructure overlaps, there are some similarities in their TTPs and victimology. Both\nactors use open-source tools to perform credential exfiltration and initial reconnaissance. In\nterms of bespoke tools, both threat actors have an affinity towards using Python-based\nimplants, usually distributed, implemented or packed in a rather unusual way that is\ncharacteristic of the respective threat actors. The PoetRAT team would append the Python\ninterpreter to a malicious document that would be extracted and used to execute the\nPython-based PoetRAT. YoroTropper used the Nuitka framework to pack their custom\ncredential stealer in such a weird way that it ended up leaking the Python code rather than\nobfuscating it.\n\nRegarding victimology, there are some noteworthy overlaps between YoroTrooper and the\nPoetRAT team, who mainly target Azerbaijan, specifically their embassies, energy sector\nand government institutions. YoroTropper is also targeting Azerbaijan and other CIS\ncountries, and their embassies, with a similar focus on the energy sector.\n\n## Kasablanka is not the sole operator of LodaRAT\n\nWhile attributing this campaign to a specific threat actor, what stuck out the most was the\nuse of LodaRAT and its repeated attribution to a singular threat actor called “Kasablanka” in\nopen-source reporting. While Talos assesses that LodaRAT is built and sometimes operated\n\n\n-----\n\nby Kasablanka, there is evidence that indicates that LodaRAT is being used in multiple\ndistinct campaigns. Therefore, despite the fact that LodaRAT isn’t publicly available, either\n[open-sourced or for sale publicly — although one can be decompiled easily for use by any](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/get-a-loda-this/)\nactor — our assessment is that there are multiple operators in the threat landscape\nemploying LodaRAT. Therefore, YoroTrooper’s use of LodaRAT should not be used as the\nsole indicator for attribution.\n\nOur research shows that the LodaRAT samples used by YoroTrooper deviate from previous\nversions of the malware employed by Kasablanka. In fact, the LodaRAT variants used by\nYoro Trooper are based on versions we’ve seen being deployed in other crimeware\ncampaigns alongside RedLine and VenomRAT, indicating LodaRAT’s availability to multiple\nthreat actors.\n\nThis strengthens our assertion that although Kasablanka is the developer of LodaRAT and\n[Loda4Android, it is not the sole operator of LodaRAT, an](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/kasablanka-lodarat/) [assessment we made as early as](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/kasablanka-lodarat/)\n2021.\n\n## Campaign profiles\n\nThis threat actor extensively targets CIS countries using a variety of malware deployed by a\nrelatively simple infection chain. The operators have utilized a diverse suite of malware\nsuch as:\n\nCommodity RATs and stealers: Warzone, LodaRAT and Stink stealer.\nCustom Python-based information stealers: Custom scripts for stealing Google\nChrome browser credentials.\nCustom Python-based RATs (with exfiltrators): First seen in June 2022, but gained\npopularity with the threat actor around February 2023.\nReverse shells: Python and Meterpreter-based reverse shells.\n\nThe following is a timeline of the various geographies targeted by attacks in the campaign\noperated by YoroTrooper.\n\n\nTime\nframe\n\n\nTargeted\nGeography\n\n\nSalient TTPs\n\n\n-----\n\nFebruary\n2023\n\nLate\nJanuary\n2023\n\nEarly\nJanuary\n2023\n\nDecember\n2022\n\nNovember\n2022\n\nOctober\n2022\n\n\nUzbekistan - Reuses Uzbekistani themed lures/decoys:\n\n      - Memo from energy company “UZBEKHYDROENERGO”\n\n       - Deploys a custom-built Python based reverse shell and file\nexfiltrator with variants built via PyInstaller and Nuitka.\n\n       - Uses HTA files.\n\n       - Also deploys Meterpreter reverse shells in certain cases.\n\nUzbekistan - Uses Uzbekistani themed lures/decoys:\n\n      - Memo from energy company “UZBEKHYDROENERGO”\n\n       - Deploys Python implant - custom Python based stealer.\n\n      - HTA downloads Decoy and dropper implant.\n\nTajikistan - Uses Tajikistani themed lures: Report from Government of\nTajikistan.\n\n       - Deploys Python implant - custom Python based stealer.\n\n      - HTA downloads decoy documents and dropper implants.\n\nRussia - Uses Russian themed lures.\n\n       - Uses VHDX files containing archives and LNKs that\ndownload and activate LodaRAT.\n\nAzerbaijan - Uses Azerbaijani lures and malicious domains:\n\n        - mail[.]mfa[.]az-link[.]email, true[.]az-link[.]email\n\n       - Deploys Python implant - Stink stealer.\n\nBelarus - IPs and domains masquerade as Belarusian domains:\n\n        - mail[.]belaes[.]by[.]authentication[.]becloud[.]cc\n\n      - One variant of HTA downloads only AveMaria/Warzone RAT.\n\n       - Another variant of HTA downloads only Python based\nimplants - Stink stealer.\n\n       - No lures.\n\n\n-----\n\nSeptember\n2022\n\nAugust\n2022\n\n\nRussia - VHDX based distribution introduced.\n\n      - No HTAs employed - LNKs download .NET based implants\ndirectly using curl.\n\n       - Malicious subdomains masquerading (typo-squatted) as\nRussian government entities:\n\n        - rnail[.]mintrans[.]gov[.]ru[.]inro[.]link ;\nrnail[.]iterrf[.]ru[.]inro[.]link ; account[.]nail[.]ru[.]inro[.]link ;\nrnail[.]rnid[.]ru[.]inro[.]link\n\n\nBelarus,\nRussia\n\n\n\n- IPs and domains masquerade as Belarusian and Russian\ndomains:\n\n- mail[.]hse[.]ru[.]attachment-posts[.]cc ;\nbelstat[.]gov[.]by[.]attachment-posts[.]cc ;\nminsk[.]gov[.]by[.]attachment-posts[.]cc\n\n- No HTAs employed - LNKs download Python based reverse\nshells directly using curl.\n\n- Corrupt PDFs used as lures.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Campaigns infection chain\n\nThe latest infection chain from January 2023 is relatively straightforward but consists of\nmultiple components such as archives, LNKs, HTAs and ultimately the final payloads:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infection chains begin with a malicious archive (RARs or ZIPs) delivered to targets with\nlure document titles referring to topics of interest to CIS nations, such as:\n\nNational_Development_Strategy.rar\nPresidents_Strategy_2023.rar\n\nThe campaign has also employed some generic file names as well such as “Nota.rar”,\n“вложение.rar”.\n\nWe have also observed the occasional inclusion of decoy documents in the archive files, as\nwell.\n\nThe malicious LNK files are simple downloaders that employ mshta.exe to download and\nexecute a remote HTA file on the infected endpoint.\n\nLNK files downloading and executing remote HTA files.\n\nThe malicious HTA files employed in this campaign have seen a steady evolution with the\nlatest variant downloading the next-stage payload: a malicious EXE-based dropper and a\ndecoy document. All these tasks are accomplished by running PowerShell-based\ncommands.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious HTA.\n\n## Custom-built final payloads\n\nYoroTrooper has been consistently introducing new malware into their infection chains in\nthis campaign, including both custom-built and commodity malware. It is worth noting that\nwhile this campaign began with the distribution of commodity malware such as AveMaria\nand LodaRAT, it has evolved significantly to include Python-based malware. This highlights\nan increase in the efforts the threat actor is putting in, likely derived from successful\nbreaches during the course of the campaign.\n\n### Custom Python RAT\n\nThe custom-built Python-based RAT is relatively simple. It uses Telegram as a medium of\nC2 communication and exfiltration and contains functionality to:\n\nRun arbitrary commands on the infected endpoint.\nUpload files of interest to the attacker to a telegram channel via a bot.\n\nThis bot was wrapped up into a .exe either using PyInstaller or Nuitka and then deployed in\nthe field. There are some interesting observations here suggesting that the adversary may\nbe speak Russian:\n\nThe presence of telegram messages in Russian such as: “Сохраняю в {save_dir}” or\n“Файл загружен!\\nИмя”.\n\n\n-----\n\nCode that decodes the output of a command run on the system into CP866 - Code\npage for Cyrillic.\n\nSnippet: Python based RAT used by YoroTrooper.\n\n### Customized stealer script\n\nAnother Python-based payload distributed in January 2023 consists of a simple stealer\nscript that will extract login data for the Chrome browser and exfiltrate it via a Telegram bot.\nThis custom script has likely been stitched together from publicly available sources, such as\n[Lazagne:](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/blob/b1289b8f69d41356d85403c6ecefc569588b3a68/Linux/lazagne/softwares/browsers/chromium_based.py?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Commodity and miscellaneous malware\n\nYoroTrooper has relied heavily on the use of primarily two commodity malware families,\nAveMaria/Warzone RAT and LodaRAT, especially in October and November 2022.\nAveMaria is a highly prolific malware family available for sale online, while LodaRAT is a\nRAT-based family whose authorshiphas been attributed to the Kasablanka threat actor.\n\n### Stink stealer analysis\n\nYet another one of the final payloads found being deployed by YoroTrooper is an open[source credential stealer called “Stink,” which is wrapped into an executable file using the](https://github.com/FallenAstaroth/stink?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\n[Nuitka Python compiler framework](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nStink has several modules from Chromium-based browsers that collect credentials, cookies\nand bookmarks, among other information. It harvests Filezilla credentials and authentication\ncookies from Discord and Telegram. From the system, the stealer will collect a screenshot,\nexternal IP address, operating system, processor, graphic card and running processes:\n\nAll modules are executed in their own process and even each process will use its own\nthreads to speed up the information collection process. The information is stored in a\ntemporary directory before being compressed and exfiltrated.\n\nThe sender module is responsible for data exfiltration via a Telegram bot. As of early March,\nthe latest version of Stink Stealer 2.1.1 has an autostart configuration option that will create\na link in the startup folder of the victim profile with the name “Windows Runner.”\n\nAutostart configuration options.\n\n### Miscellaneous malware\n\nApart from commodity malware, we’ve also observed YoroTrooper deploy implants serving\nas reverse shells against their targets. For example, in September 2022, we saw a simple\nPython-based reverse shell. This one, however, was missing the Cyrillic language check\n(CP866).\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother set of reverse shell implants that YoroTrooper occasionally uses are Meterpreter\nbinaries that are then used to execute arbitrary commands on the infected endpoint. This\ntactic was seen being used by YoroTrooper as late as February 2023.\n\nA C-based custom keylogger also discovered by Talos probably deployed by one of the final\nstage payloads consists of the ability to record keystrokes and save them to a file on disk.\n\n\n-----\n\nSnippet: Keylogger functionality.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
