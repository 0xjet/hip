While domain parking might appear harmless at\nfirst glance, parked domains pose significant threats, as they can redirect visitors to\nmalicious or unwanted landing pages or turn entirely malicious at any point in time.\n\nWe have been detecting parked domains for more than nine years. From March to\nSeptember 2020, we identified 5 million newly parked domains. In the same time frame, we\nobserved that 6 million parked domains have transitioned to other categories. Out of the\ntransitioned parked domains, 1.0% changed to malicious categories (such as phishing or\nmalware); 2.6% changed to not safe for work categories (such as adult or gambling); and\n\n\n-----\n\n30.6% changed to suspicious categories (such as questionable or high Risk). Compared to a\n_benign domain (such as computer and internet info or shopping), a parked domain has an_\neight times higher probability of changing its category to one of the above non-benign\ncategories.\n\nIn this blog, we further investigate the domain parking ecosystem and outline different types\nof abuse, including:\n\n**Domain registration abuse: We observed the malicious life cycle of the domain**\nvalleymedicalandsurgicalclinic[.]com, which is no longer active, as part of a global\n[Emotet campaign. Emotet is one of the most popular malware families distributed via](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/emotet/)\nphishing emails. During this campaign, Palo Alto Networks observed attacks against\norganizations in various industries (such as education, government, energy,\nmanufacturing, construction and telecommunications) all over the world, including the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Korea and Italy. The attack\ntargeting French organizations also exploited the COVID-19 global pandemic: It used\n_Covid19 as the phishing email’s subject line. None of these attacks were successful._\n**Advertisement abuse (case 1): We observed attackers abusing the domain**\npeoplesvote[.]uk related to the current U.S. presidential election. While visiting\npeoplesvote[.]uk, users are presented with an ad listing page most of the time.\nHowever, occasionally, users are first redirected to 0redira[.]com/jr.php, which hosts an\nexploit kit script, and subsequently users are redirected to a survey website asking\nabout users’ voting preference of Joe Biden or Donald Trump. The exploit kit script\nhosted on 0redira[.]com/jr.php fingerprints the browser silently to track users’ web\nactivity and hides the landing URLs to prevent security companies and researchers\nfrom analyzing and blocking them. Of note, these pages are still active as of this\nwriting.\n**Advertisement abuse (case 2): Furthermore, we observed a domain, xifinity[.]com,**\nmimicking xfinity[.]com. When a user attempts to visit the Xfinity website but\naccidentally types an additional \"i,\" they will go to xifinity[.]com and will be redirected to\nan abusive landing page, antivirus-protection[.]com-123[.]xyz. Both domains are active\nas of this writing. The landing page tries to fool users into believing that their machine\nis infected and that their McAfee subscription has expired. Clicking on the “Proceed”\nbutton will redirect users to a legitimate McAfee download page offering an antivirus\nsubscription. We believe that attackers are abusing McAfee’s affiliate program to steal\nad revenue.\n\nSecurity best practice for enterprises is to keep close track of parked domains, while\nconsumers should make sure that they type domain names correctly and double-check that\nthe domain owners are trusted before entering any site.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers can block the parked category with\nthe [URL Filtering and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/threat-detection-and-prevention/web-security) [DNS Security subscriptions.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/threat-detection-and-prevention/dns-security)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Domain Parking: Why and How\n\nIndividuals and enterprises need to pay registrars (ICANN accredited domain resellers) an\nannual fee to buy domain names and become domain owners. If domain owners don't have\ncontent or service ready to point their domains to, they can leverage parking services to\nmonetize user traffic. Setting up a parking service is simple and only requires domain owners\nto point their name server (NS) records to the parking service. In return, parking services will\neither present visitors with a list of advertisements or automatically redirect users to\nadvertisers' webpages. In the first case, domain owners and parking services get paid when\na user clicks on an ad, while in the second case, they get paid per user visit. Some domain\nowners buy large amounts of domain names as an investment to resell them later for a profit\nor to monetize user traffic. As shown by [previous research studies and this blog, parked](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2015/ndss-2015-programme/parking-sensors-analyzing-and-detecting-parked-domains/)\ndomains can pose significant threats to end-users. Because of this, along with their\nquestionable utility, it may be best to block parked domains.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has deployed a comprehensive pipeline to track newly parked domains\nand to publish the detection results to URL Filtering. Recently, we have launched the parked\ncategory in DNS Security as well. In particular, our pipeline:\n\n1. Monitors known parked service providers and their infrastructure.\n2. Tracks domain registrations and passive DNS queries and performs reverse DNS\n\nlookups.\n3. Crawls website content.\n4. Employs machine learning to combine multiple features to classify whether a domain is\n\nparked.\n\n**High-Level Statistics**\n\nTo analyze the current parked domain landscape, we collected the parked domains that were\ndetected from March to September 2020, as well as the ones whose category changed from\nparked to other categories in the same time span. On average, we found that 27,000 newly\nparked domains were identified and 35,000 existing parked domains were re-classified daily.\nIn summary, our pipeline has identified 5 million newly parked domains and re-classified 6\nmillion parked domains to other categories in the past six months.\n\nFigure 1 summarizes how we observed parked domains changing during this time period.\nFor simplicity, we group the URL Filtering categories into four classes: malicious, not safe for\n_work, suspicious and benign. The malicious class consists of malware, command and control_\n(C2), phishing and grayware. Adult, gambling and nudity are represented in the not safe for\n_work class. For suspicious, we include questionable, insufficient content and high risk_\ndomains. Sites are deemed questionable based on suspicious web content, while the\ninsufficient content category is normally applied to a blank website and high risk means the\ndomain displays behavior similar to malicious domains. The benign class encompasses all\nother categories, such as business and economy, computer and internet info and shopping.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 shows that for parked domains, the malicious change rate is 1.0%, the not safe for\n_work change rate is 2.6% and the suspicious change rate is 30.6%. As a comparison, the_\nnon-benign change rate of the parked category is eight times higher than the non-benign\nchange rate of benign categories.\n\nFigure 1. A list of categories that parked domains we observed changed to in the last six\nmonths.\nFigure 2 presents the distribution of the number of days that domains that we ultimately\ncategorize as malicious and benign are parked before changing their category. We\naggregate the number of category changes from parked for every 10 parked days and\nnormalize by the total number of domains per class. Figure 2 shows that over 25.9% of\nparked domains that changed to malicious categories are parked for less than 10 days,\nwhich is significantly different from benign, where the majority of them are parked for around\n60-69 days. We conjecture that many cybercriminals do not age their domains (a practice\nused to evade domain lifetime-based detection features) and use them to conduct attacks as\nsoon as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. The number of days a domain is parked before a category change occurs, based\non observations made during the last six months.\n\n## The Ecosystem and Attack Vectors\n\nIn this section, we further investigate the benefits of detecting and blocking parked domains.\nWe begin by dissecting the domain parking ecosystem into different stakeholder groups. We\nthen show that the largest attack vector is domain registration, since attackers can register\nparked domains and turn them malicious at any time. Second, we show that attackers can\nabuse the lack of advertisement control by some smaller advertisement networks used by\nparking services, thereby redirecting visitors to malicious or unwanted landing pages. Last,\nwe show that even a parking service itself can pose privacy threats to users.\n\n**Stakeholders**\n\nWe show the major stakeholder groups in the domain parking ecosystem and their\nrelationships in Figure 3, namely domain owners, parking service providers, advertisement\n_networks and advertisers. Note that the term stakeholders as used here represents roles and_\ncan refer to the same entity or multiple entities. Domain owners own parked domains and\nhave the incentive to monetize through parking service providers. Parking service providers\nincorporate and organize feeds from advertisement networks to monetize user traffic.\nAdvertisement networks characterize user traffic from parked domains and present ads to\nusers from interested advertisers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Stakeholders in the domain parking ecosystem and their relationships.\nAs mentioned previously, domain owners need to point their NS records to the parking\nservice’s name server to “park” their domains. We measured the popularity of service\nproviders by checking the DNS NS records of parked domains detected from March to\nSeptember 2020. Figure 4 presents the top 15 most popular NS domains. The majority of\nparked domains are resolved by the NS of large registrars, including GoDaddy\n(domaincontrol[.]com) and NameBright (namebrightdns[.]com). Besides the large registrars\nand hosting providers, we identified several dedicated parking service providers. The most\npopular dedicated provider is Sedo (sedoparking[.]com), which is used by 19.5% of parked\ndomains.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. A list of parking service providers including registrars, hosting providers and\ndedicated parking providers.\n\n**Domain Registration Abuse**\n\nParked domains could present threats to users when they turn malicious. Figure 1 shows\nthat 1.0% of parked domains eventually changed to malicious categories such as C2 and\nmalware. Some attackers appear to host parked pages on their domains before deploying\nmalicious content, potentially to amortize their costs.\n\nFor example, we observed the malicious life cycle of the domain\nvalleymedicalandsurgicalclinic[.]com. This domain was registered on July 8, 2020. Our newly\nregistered domain detector found this domain, and our parking detector pipeline classified it\nas parked based on the website content. Two months later, our malware analysis engine,\n[WildFire, captured multiple malware instances, such as SHA256:](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\na9fe73484674696be756808e93f839be7157cd65995d8de9e67e40bf77c9b229 and\n54ac560845b09ce00a48b604ac7c440331cbde4362839a3dbf14c378230bee21 hosted on\nthe URL valleymedicalandsurgicalclinic[.]com/ujftb/statement/wr7hoba7i9hz since Sept. 14,\n2020. Furthermore, we discovered that it's part of a global Emotet campaign (refer to our\nrecent Emotet blog for more information). Emotet is one of the most popular malware\nfamilies distributed via phishing emails. The documents attached to the phishing emails\ncontain macro scripts that call back to the C2 servers from victims’ machines. Emotet further\ndownloads Trojan payloads that steal victims' credential information or even compromises\ntheir machines. We can see many suspicious behaviors from these files, including incorrect\nfile extensions and communication with multiple C2 servers, such as 50.91.114[.]38 and\n51.38.124[.]206. We sketch the phases of the Emotet campaign in Figure 5.\n\nThe observed campaign was launched using multiple domains around the world. During this\ncampaign, Palo Alto Networks observed attacks against organizations in various industries\n(such as education, government, energy, manufacturing, construction and\ntelecommunications) all over the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom,\n\n\n-----\n\nFrance, Japan, Korea and Italy. The attack targeting French organizations also exploited the\nCOVID-19 global pandemic: It used Covid19 as the phishing email’s subject line (refer to our\n[COVID-19 scams blog for similar cases). None of the attacks were successful.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/how-cybercriminals-prey-on-the-covid-19-pandemic/)\n\nFigure 5. Illustration of the phases of the Emotet campaign.\n\n**Advertisement Abuse**\n\nThe domain parking ecosystem depends on advertisers to profit from user traffic. As\ndiscussed earlier, parking services either show users a list of ads (and get paid based on the\nnumber of user clicks on these ads) or redirect users automatically to the advertisers’\nwebpages (and get paid based on the number of user visits). Often the parking services and\nthe advertisement networks do not have the means or willingness to filter abusive advertisers\n(i.e. attackers). Therefore, users are exposed to various threats, such as malware\ndistribution, potentially unwanted program (PUP) distribution and phishing scams. In our\nexperience, we most frequently observe the distribution of grayware.\n\nWe observed attackers abusing the domain peoplesvote[.]uk related to the current U.S.\npresidential election, which was allowed by the lack of control by above[.]com, the seventhmost popular domain parking service, as shown in Figure 4. While visiting peoplesvote[.]uk,\nusers are presented with an ad listing page most of the time, as shown in Figure 6. However,\noccasionally, users are first redirected to 0redira[.]com/jr.php, which hosts an exploit kit\nscript, and subsequently redirected to a survey website asking about users’ voting\npreference, as shown in Figure 7. The exploit kit script hosted on 0redira[.]com/jr.php\nfingerprints the browser silently to track users’ web activity and hides the landing URLs. Of\nnote, these pages are still active as of this writing.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. The ad listing page often seen while visiting peoplesvote[.]uk.\n\nFigure 7. The voting preference landing page that is sometimes seen after visiting\npeoplesvote[.]uk and being redirected to a survey website.Furthermore, we observed\nattackers abusing the largest dedicated parking service provider, Sedo. We found a parked\ndomain, xifinity[.]com, that is a typosquatting domain mimicking xfinity[.]com (refer to our\ncybersquatting blog or [this academic paper for more information). When a user attempts to](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-szurdi.pdf)\nvisit the Xfinity website but accidentally types an additional \"i,\" they will go to xifinity[.]com\nand will be redirected to an advertiser page. We identified that the traffic to this domain is\nsold to multiple advertisers. One of the advertisers, softonic[.]com, presents users with a\nsoftware download page.\nBesides legitimate advertisers, we also captured multiple redirections to PUPs from\nattackers. Figure 8 shows one of the abusive landing pages, the level-squatting domain\nantivirus-protection[.]com-123[.]xyz. The landing page tries to trick users into believing that\ntheir machine is infected and that their McAfee subscription has expired. Clicking on the\n\n\n-----\n\nProceed button will redirect users to a legitimate McAfee download page offering an\nantivirus subscription. We believe that attackers are abusing McAfee’s affiliate program to\nsteal ad revenue.\n\nAs a squatting domain, xifinity[.]com receives a high visit volume compared to other parked\ndomains. We observed over 1,000 DNS requests for xifinity[.]com in our passive DNS\ndataset from June to September 2020, and the domain is still active as of this writing – as is\nantivirus-protection[.]com-123[.]xyz. From a domain owner’s perspective, using a parking\nservice is a convenient way to monetize user traffic. However, as abusive advertisers (i.e.\nattackers) are not filtered, users are exposed to various threats.\n\nFigure 8. The landing page impersonating McAfee while visiting xifinity[.]com.\n\n**Parking Service Abuse**\n\nWe observed several parked pages using ztomy[.]com, the 14th-most popular parking\nservice provider (shown in Figure 4), harvesting visitors' personal information. We observed\nthat these pages generate fingerprints of users' browsers and send them back to the parked\ndomain. The parked pages are using the browser fingerprinting script from pxlgnpgecoma.akamaihd[.]net/javascripts/browserfp.min.js, which collects various private information and\ntracks user behavior. These browser fingerprints could be leveraged to track visitors’ online\nactivities, allowing advertisement networks to target visitors with ads tailored to them.\n[Additionally, domain owners complained online that their domains' NS records were](https://www.namepros.com/threads/scam-network-solutions-ztomy-com-ns1642-ztomy-com.872246/)\nconfigured to ztomy NS servers without their awareness, which could be considered a form\nof domain hijacking.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. An example of a parked domain, bridgeplatform[.]biz, using ztomy[.]com as the\nparking service provider.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, parked domains can expose users to threats as they can redirect visitors to\nmalicious or unwanted landing pages or turn entirely malicious in the future. Due to their\nquestionable utility and the fact that our system can quickly re-classify parked domains when\nthey merit new categories, we suggest that Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall\ncustomers block the parked category with URL Filtering or DNS Security. While this may be\ndeemed a bit overly cautious by some due to potential false positives, we suggest alerts be\nset up for additional visibility at the bare minimum.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected against malicious\nindicators (domain, IP, URL, SHA256) mentioned in this blog via URL Filtering, DNS Security\n[and Threat Prevention subscription services.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Wei Wang and Ryan Nangong for their help with providing some of\nthe data sources necessary for our analysis.
