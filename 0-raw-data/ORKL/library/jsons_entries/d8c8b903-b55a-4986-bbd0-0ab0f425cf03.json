    "plain_text": "# German wind farm operator confirms cybersecurity incident\n\n**[therecord.media/german-wind-farm-operator-confirms-cybersecurity-incident-after-ransomware-group/](https://therecord.media/german-wind-farm-operator-confirms-cybersecurity-incident-after-ransomware-group/)**\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nGerman wind farm operator Deutsche Windtechnik confirmed that it was hit with a\ncyberattack earlier this month, becoming the latest in a string of German energy providers\nto face disruptions from a cybersecurity incident.\n\nIn [a statement, the company said its IT systems were targeted by a cyberattack on the night](https://www.deutsche-windtechnik.com/press-information/item/463-Cyber-attack-on-Deutsche-Windtechnik)\nbetween April 11 and 12.\n\n“As we previously reported, we were able to reactivate the remote data monitoring\nconnections to the wind turbines after 1-2 days, which had been switched off for security\nreasons,” the company explained.\n\n“We are very happy that the wind turbines that we look after did not suffer any damage and\nwere never in danger. Deutsche Windtechnik’s operational maintenance activities for our\nclients resumed again on April 14 and are running with only minor restrictions.”\n\nThe company’s IT team was able to isolate the problems and the company noted that its\nforensic analysis showed it was a “targeted professional cyberattack.”\n\nIt is still working to restore the availability of all communication channels and noted that the\nincident was reported to the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe company did not respond to questions about whether it was hit with a ransomware\nattack, but it showed up on the leak site of the Black Basta ransomware gang according to\nMalwareHunterTeam, an account on Twitter tracking ransomware groups.\n\nNot seen it mentioned by anyone yet, so: Deutsche Windtechnik is also on Black Basta\nransomware gang's leak site. Leak is at 100% published stage already.\nActually, not really got surprised to see this company on their leak site…\n[pic.twitter.com/eH6keCpSWb](https://t.co/eH6keCpSWb)\n\n[— MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam) April 26, 2022](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1519074714479738881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThere have been several attacks on German energy providers this year. German wind\n[turbine maker Nordex was forced to shut down its IT systems across multiple locations and](https://therecord.media/german-wind-turbine-maker-shut-down-after-cyberattack/)\n[business units after it was hit with a cyberattack on March 31.](https://www.nordex-online.com/en/2022/04/nordex-group-impacted-by-cyber-security-incident/)\n\nThe attack on Nordex followed an incident where a cyberattack on satellite communications\ncompany [Viasat caused the malfunction of 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany.](https://therecord.media/viasat-confirms-report-of-wiper-malware-used-in-ukraine-cyberattack/)\n\nWind turbine maker Vestas was [hit with a ransomware attack in November, and the group](https://www.vestas.com/en/media/company-news/2021/third-update-on-cyber-incident-c3466518)\nbehind the attack eventually threatened to leak the data it stole. Like Nordex, the company\nhad to shut down its IT systems across multiple business units and locations to stop the\nissue from spreading.\n\nOil companies Oiltanking and Mabanaft, both owned by German logistics conglomerate\n[Marquard & Bahls Group, suffered a cyberattack that crippled their loading and unloading](https://www.zdnet.com/article/shell-forced-re-route-oil-supplies-after-cyberattack-on-german-companies/)\nsystems in February.\n\nAn [internal report from the BSI said the BlackCat ransomware group was behind the](https://www.zdnet.com/article/blackcat-ransomware-implicated-in-attack-on-german-oil-companies/)\ncyberattack on the oil companies.\n\nTags\n\n[Black Basta](https://therecord.media/tag/black-basta/)\n[cyberattack](https://therecord.media/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Deutsche Windtechnik](https://therecord.media/tag/deutsche-windtechnik/)\n[energy](https://therecord.media/tag/energy/)\n[Germany](https://therecord.media/tag/germany/)\n[Nordex](https://therecord.media/tag/nordex/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[viasat](https://therecord.media/tag/viasat/)\n[wind turbine](https://therecord.media/tag/wind-turbine/)\n\n\n-----\n\nJonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014.
