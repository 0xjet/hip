    "plain_text": "# Dragos ICS/OT Ransomware Analysis: Q4 2021\n\n**[dragos.com/blog/industry-news/dragos-ics-ot-ransomware-analysis-q4-2021/](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/dragos-ics-ot-ransomware-analysis-q4-2021/)**\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nA common misconception suggests ransomware is solely a threat to information technology\n(IT); however, data from 2021 indicates ransomware is having an increasing impact on\noperational technology (OT) as well.\n\nRansomware can cause OT impacts in four ways:\n\n1. In the case of [Colonial Pipeline, operators preemptively shut down their operations to](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/recommendations-following-the-colonial-pipeline-cyber-attack/)\n\nprevent enterprise IT ransomware from spreading into OT. This strategy, while causing\ndisruption, preserves OT from potential long-term downtime caused by a successful\nransomware infection.\n2. Flat networks and lack of asset visibility create an environment where ransomware\n\ncan spread quickly through both IT and OT networks.\n3. Dragos is aware of six ransomware strains that possess built-in OT kill processes:\n\n[Cl0p, MegaCortex, Netfilim, LockerGoga, Maze, and EKANS. While Ransomware](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-misconceptions-and-misunderstandings/)\nactors often use process kill lists to target security products in IT networks, in the\ncontext of OT networks the adversaries kill processes which are critical to OT\nfunctions and which might otherwise prevent the ransomware from encrypting critical\nfiles used by the OT programs.\n4. Ransomware attacks that impact enterprise IT systems only, but lead to the release of\n\nproprietary documentation on OT technology on underground forums if the ransom is\nnot paid, could lead to follow-on attacks targeting OT technology directly by\ncybercriminals or state-sponsored actors.\n\nDragos analyzed data from 37 ransomware strains on Dark Web resources leveraged to\npost victims, leak files, and conduct negotiations. Appearance on a Dark Web resource\ndoes not confirm that ransomware actors successfully compromised a firm, the extent of\naccess achieved by the ransomware actors, or whether a firm made the ransomware\npayment. Occasionally, ransomware actors will post inaccurate information on Dark Web\nresources; for example, listing the name of one firm and the description of a completely\ndifferent firm. This may be accidental, or an attempt to cause confusion amongst victims.\n\nIn some cases, ransomware actors will attempt to appear to have compromised a victim by\ncross-posting documents identified as part of a different ransomware breach, as was the\ncase with Schneider Electric and Vestas. While Dark Web resources are not fully accurate,\n\n\n-----\n\nthey provide unique insight into the priorities of ransomware groups, including which sectors\nand sub-sectors they most frequently target, which sectors they prioritize, and which areas\nof the globe are more likely to experience attacks.\n\nDragos observed the following trends in Q4 2021 (October, November, and December).\n\n## Ransomware Victim by Location\n\nGlobally, 41% of postings featuring victims located in the U.S.; Germany and Italy tied for\nsecond with 9% of activity respectively.\n\nActivity stayed consistent each month, with 58 Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Dark Web\npostings in October, 57 in November, and 61 in December for a total of 176. However,\nindividual group activity spiked month to month, with Grief posting seven of their 13 ICS\nvictims in October, one in November, and five in December; notably, all but one Grief\npostings were victims in the Manufacturing sector. Additionally, PYSA activity spiked in\nNovember with 11 ICS victim postings across sectors including Oil and Gas, Food and\nBeverage, and Transportation; Dragos observed 13 total PYSA victim postings during this\ntimeframe.\n\n## Ransomware by ICS Sector\n\nBy sector, 65% of postings featured victims in the Manufacturing sector, which is consistent\nwith data collected starting 1 June 2021. Dragos identified 52 unique manufacturing subsectors during this timeframe. By sub-sector, 14% of victims were in metal product\n\n\n-----\n\nManufacturing, 9% were in automotive Manufacturing, and 7% were in technology\nManufacturing.\n\nRansomware attacks against the Manufacturing Sector may cause upstream and\ndownstream disruption to transportation companies and other sectors dependent on\nmanufacturing output, including food and beverage, automotive firms, energy firms that\nleverage metal products, and technology firms. For example, a successful attack against a\nmanufacturer of automotive parts may halt further production of vehicles leveraging that\ncomponent.\n\nFollowing Manufacturing, 10% of attacks featured victims in the Transportation Sector, 10%\nfeatured the Food and Beverage sector, and 4% each featured Energy, Pharmaceuticals,\nand Oil and Natural Gas.\n\n## Ransomware by Group or Strain\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalyzing the data by ransomware strain, Lockbit 2.0 made 28% of postings and Conti\nmade 18% for a total of 46% between the two groups. Interestingly, PYSA’s November\nactivity spike nearly tied Conti’s number of attack victims in the same period, with 11 ICS\nvictims to Conti’s 12. This is not true for any other month. 81% of Conti’s ICS Dark Web\npostings featured the manufacturing sector.\n\nLockbit 2.0 Ransomware Threat Behavior\n\nIn June, Lockbit 2.0 developers launched a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) program to\n[enable affiliates to leverage the platform to conduct ransomware attacks.1](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/rising-threat-from-lockbit-ransomware) The platform\nuses a double extortion model, where data is exfiltrated prior to systems being locked; if the\nvictim refuses to make a payment, attackers will threaten to leak the exfiltrated data. The\naffiliates who conducted the attack and the developers of the ransomware split any ransom\npayments between themselves. Lockbit is believed to be related to the LockerGoga and\nMegaCortex ransomware families due to shared tactics, techniques, and procedures,\nparticularly the ability to propagate automatically to new targets.\n\n\nAccording to an article published on 4 August, Lockbit is actively recruiting corporate\ninsiders to provide Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Virtual Private Network (VPN), and\nemail credentials to assist attackers in gaining access to networks in exchange for million\n[dollar payouts.2](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-recruiting-insiders-to-breach-corporate-networks/) Lockbit does not operate in countries that are formerly a part of the Soviet\n[Union and leverages tools such as StealBIT, Metasploit Framework, and Cobalt Strike.3](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/08/16/a-deep-dive-analysis-of-lockbit-2-0/) In\nlate July, reports emerged indicating researchers had uncovered a new version of the of the\n\n\n-----\n\nLockbit 2.0 ransomware platform that automates the encryption of a Windows domain using\n[Active Directory group policies.4](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-now-encrypts-windows-domains-using-group-policies/) Dragos assesses with low confidence Lockbit, and\nsubsequent iterations of this ransomware group, will continue to develop innovative\ntechniques to increase potency of ransomware operations.\n\nConti Ransomware Threat Behavior\n\nConti is also a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platform; however, a September report by\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) notes a variation in its structure as\ndeployers are likely paid a wage rather than a percentage of the profits in the event the\n[ransom is paid.5](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a) Techniques used by Conti are not especially unique; for example, they\nmaintain persistence using Cobalt Strike or Powershell. However, unlike many ransomware\ngroups who focus on building the reputation that victims will receive their files if the ransom\nis paid, Conti is significantly more volatile, occasionally not returning files after victims pay\nthe ransom or only returning a fraction of compromised files.\n\nIn August 2021, an alleged Conti affiliate leaked the group’s “playbook” after apparently not\nreceiving full payment following an attack; researchers who viewed the playbook advised\nnetwork administrators looking for Conti activity to “scan for unauthorized Atera Agent\n[applications and Any Desk persistence.”6](https://threatpost.com/affiliate-leaks-conti-ransomware-playbook/168442/)\n\n## Looking Forward into 2022\n\nDragos assesses with high confidence ransomware will continue to disrupt OT operations,\nwhether through integration of OT kill processes into ransomware strains, flattened\nnetworks allowing for ransomware to spread into OT environments, or through\nprecautionary shutdowns of OT environments by operators to prevent ransomware from\nspreading to OT systems.\n\nAdditionally, Dragos assesses with low confidence state-sponsored adversaries may\nleverage ransomware to mask alternate operations, including theft of intellectual property\n(including key OT schematic details), reconnaissance of target networks, and other Stage 1\ncomponents of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain.\n\nFinally, Dragos assesses with moderate confidence ransomware actors will continue to\nleverage extortion techniques in pursuit of ransom payments; additionally, Dragos assesses\nwith low confidence these methods will grow in severity and intensity as threat actors\ndeploy any available means to collect their ransom.\n\n**References:**\n\n1 [The Rising Threat from LockBit Ransomware – CyberEason](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/rising-threat-from-lockbit-ransomware)\n\n2 [LockBit ransomware recruiting insiders to breach corporate networks – Bleeping](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-recruiting-insiders-to-breach-corporate-networks/)\nComputer\n\n3 [LockBIT 2.0 Ransomware – Cyble](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/08/16/a-deep-dive-analysis-of-lockbit-2-0/)\n\n\n-----\n\n4 [LockBit ransomware now encrypts Windows domains using group policies – Bleeping](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-now-encrypts-windows-domains-using-group-policies/)\nComputer\n5 [Conti Ransomware — CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a)\n6 [Angry Affiliate Leaks Conti Ransomware Gang Playbook – Threatpost](https://threatpost.com/affiliate-leaks-conti-ransomware-playbook/168442/)\n\n\n-----",
