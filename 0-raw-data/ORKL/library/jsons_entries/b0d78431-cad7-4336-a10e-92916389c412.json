However, their increase\n\nItaly (#20).\n\nagainst last quarter’s numbers was a minimal +4%,\nunlike Mexico, which experienced a +130% increase,\nalong with Canada, which had a +41% increase.\n\n\n### Decreases across Europe\n\n\nHaving reported increases across European countries\nhosting botnet C&Cs for the past year, there was finally\na reduction in Q2.

However,\nthe gap is closing between its nearest rival, Qakbot.\nIn Q1, Cobalt Strike was associated with +160% more\nmalware than Qakbot. However, this quarter the\ndifference was “only” +85% more.\n\n### Is FluBot still operational?\n\nEuropol announced in June 2022 that FluBot had been\ntaken down, so you may be questioning why we are\nshowing an 80% increase in the number of botnet C&Cs\nassociated with this malware?\n\nAs we’ve discussed in previous publications, FluBot\nused a “FastFlux” technique to host its botnet C&Cs.\nThe same botnet infrastructure also serves as C&Cs\nfor other malware families, such as TeamBot. To make\nour internal tracking easier, we continue to label the\nassociated infrastructure as FluBot, but this is effectively\nhosting all kinds of other botnet C&C badness.\n\n### Misuse of penetration testing test tools is\n on the rise\n\nGiven the prevalence of Cobalt Strike, it will come as no\nsurprise that malware related to penetration testing tools\naccount for the largest percentage of associated botnet\nC&Cs. The situation was exacerbated in Q2 by Sliver,\nwhich moved up the chart two places, with a +41% increase.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,\n Q2 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Malware families associated with botnet C&Cs\n\n\n**Rank** **Q1 2023** **Q2 2023** **% Change** **Malware Family** **Description**\n\n**#1** 2182 2501 15% Cobalt Strike Pentest Framework\n\n**#2** 969 1349 39% Qakbot Backdoor\n\n**#3** 332 596 80% Flubot Android Backdoor\n\n**#4** 889 548 -38% RecordBreaker Credential Stealer\n\n**#5** 380 456 20% AsyncRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#6** 256 361 41% Sliver Pentest Framework\n\n**#7** 417 258 -38% RedLineStealer Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#8** 254 254 0% Remcos Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#9** 321 206 -36% IcedID Credential Stealer\n\n**#10** 194 145 -25% ISFB Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#11** 185 132 -29% DCRat Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#12** - 113 New entry QuasarRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#13** 80 99 24% Tofsee Spambot\n\n**#14** - 98 New entry Havoc Backdoor\n\n**#15** 155 82 -47% NjRAT Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#16** 67 79 18% AveMaria Remote Access Trojan (RAT)\n\n**#17** 175 73 -58% Bumblebee Backdoor\n\n**#18** - 61 New entry Hydra Credential Stealer\n\n**#19** 143 53 -63% Aurora Stealer Credential Stealer\n\n**#20** 168 47 -72% Rhadamanthys Credential Stealer\n\n\n**0** **1000** **2000** **3000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware type comparisons between\n Q1 2023 and Q2 2023\n\n33.00%\n\nPentest Framework\n\n38.10%\n\n16.58%\n\nBackdoor\n\n20.24%\n\nRemote Access 22.36%\nTrojan (RAT) 20.22%\n\n4.49%\n\nAndroid Backdoor\n\n7.94%\n\n22.47%\n\nCredential Stealer\n\n12.18%\n\n1.08%\n\nSpambot\n\n1.32%\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%**\n\nQ1 2023 Q2 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,\n Q2 2023\n\n### The TLD botnet landscape after\n Freenom’s issues  \n\nLast quarter we reported on the Freenom effect; whereby\nmalicious operators were moving to the next best thing to **a brief overview**\nfree domain names - the cheapest ones available.\n\nIn Q1, researchers witnessed huge increases, i.e., +1,569%\nfor .us, which we attributed to the Freenom effect. In Q2, **Generic TLDs (gTLDs)**\nthe botnet C&C TLD landscape settled down somewhat.\nThe largest increase experienced was +133% for .cloud,\nrun by ARUBA PEC SpA, one of the largest domain\nregistries in Europe. This placed the TLD at #5, up from\n#20 in Q1. some are closed e.g., .honda.\n\n\n### New entry at #2 for .rest\n\n\nNew entrant .rest is run by Punto 2012, a Mexican-based\nregistry running gTLDs for restaurants and bars.\nWe suspect the restaurant industry focused gTLD has\nbeen running a promotion to drive domain registrations.\nAs we all know, where cheap domains prevail, criminal\nactivity will follow.\n\nWe recommend Punto 2012 work with its registrars\nto improve vetting and registration processes.\n\n### Botnet operators Cyou\n\nShortDot registry had 161 botnet C&Cs using its TLD,\n.cyou, in Q2. This is a large increase of 112% quarter on\nquarter. No doubt this is because .cyou domains are\navailable for next to nothing (at the time of publication,\nwe’ve found them available for $2.55 for the first year).\n\nMeanwhile, ShortDot’s .cfd (ClothingFashionDesign) is\na new entry at #18 to the Top 20 in Q2. We questioned\na while ago, when ShortDot took over the operation\nof TLD .sbs, if increased registrations need to lead to\nincreased abuse.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,\n Q2 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Interpreting the data\n\n\nRegistries with a greater number of active domains\nhave greater exposure to abuse. For example, in Q2 2023,\n**.com had more than 159m domains, of which 0.001%**\nwere associated with botnet C&Cs. Meanwhile, .rest\nhad approximately 38k domains, of which 0.627% were\nassociated with botnet C&Cs. Both are in the top ten\nof our listings. Still, one had a much higher percentage\nof domains related to botnet C&Cs than the other.\n\n### Working together with the industry for\n a safer internet\n\nNaturally, we prefer no TLDs to have botnet C&Cs linked\nwith them, but we live in the real world and understand\nthere will always be abuse.\n\nWhat is crucial is that abuse is dealt with quickly.\nWhere necessary, if domain names are registered\nsolely for distributing malware or hosting botnet C&Cs,\nwe would like registries to suspend these domain names.\nWe greatly appreciate the efforts of many registries\nwho work with us to ensure these actions are taken.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused top-level domains,\n Q2 2023 (continued)\n\n\n### Top abused TLDs - number of domains\n\n\n**Rank** **Q1 2023** **Q2 2023** **% Change** **TLD** **Note**\n\n**#1** 2736 1741 -36% com gTLD\n\n**#2** - 238 New entry rest gTLD\n\n**#3** 131 226 73% shop gTLD\n\n**#4** 541 188 -65% ru ccTLD\n\n**#5** 69 161 133% cloud gTLD\n\n**#5** 76 161 112% cyou gTLD\n\n**#5** 1094 161 -85% top gTLD\n\n**#8** 90 157 74% cn ccTLD\n\n**#9** 868 95 -89% us ccTLD\n\n**#10** - 94 New entry beauty gTLD\n\n**#11** - 90 New entry br ccTLD\n\n**#12** 145 85 -41% info gTLD\n\n**#13** 242 80 -67% org gTLD\n\n**#14** 103 72 -30% xyz gTLD\n\n**#15** 174 60 -66% net gTLD\n\n**#16** 318 50 -84% site gTLD\n\n**#17** - 47 New entry makeup gTLD\n\n**#18** - 44 New entry cfd gTLD\n\n**#19** - 40 New entry io ccTLD\n\n**#19** 463 40 -91% me ccTLD\n\n\n**0** **1000** **2000** **3000**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Most abused domain registrars,\n Q2 2023\n\n### Sav suffer significant increases\n\nHaving stayed out of the top three, Q2 saw Sav\nexperience an eye-watering 408% increase, placing\n\n**New entries**\n\nthem at #2. Positioned at the cheaper end of the market,\nthey focus on pseudo-TLDs. Unlike standard TLDs they\nallow registration of subdomains beneath actual domains.\nDue to the absence of ICANN fees, these domains can\n\n**Departures**\n\nbe offered at a lower price. Our researchers suspect that,\nwith Freenom’s no longer endless supply of domains,\n\nwest263.com.\n\nregistrars such as Sav promoting cheap prices are\ninevitably attracting abusive operators.\n\n### Namecheap starts to drop down\n the leaderboard\n\nHaving spent years in second place in the Top 20,\nNamecheap started to experience improvements in\nQ2, when it dropped to #3 with a -66% decrease in the\nnumber of domain names registered by botnet C&C\noperators. There were also significant decreases for\nHostinger (-86%), Google (-85%), and Nicenic (-80%).\nNice work!\n\n### Hats off to Tucows\n\nFor Canadian-based Tucows, the downward trend\ncontinues. After holding the top spot in Q4 2022 with\n597 domains, Tucows has turned it around over the\nlast six months. Dropping an impressive -75% in Q1\nof this year, followed by a further -40% in Q2, with\n90 domains associated with botnet C&Cs.
