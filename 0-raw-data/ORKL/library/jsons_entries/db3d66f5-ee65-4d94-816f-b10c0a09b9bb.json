According to Vitali Kremez, CEO of the cybersecurity firm AdvIntel, by\n[Monday morning Conti had successfully completed two new data breaches at U.S.-based](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/conti/)\ncompanies.\n\n“Conti is back and still operational and will pursue more targets,” Kremez said. “They’re safe\nand sound.”\n\nKremez and other experts said that in the days after the chats first leaked on Feb. 27, Conti\nmay have been back on its heels, but it was never fully disabled. The gang’s leadership\nmade a significant effort in the early days following the leaks to transition its infrastructure\nthat was exposed in the hacks to new systems, which slowed down ransomware activity\ninitially, experts said. That interregnum has come to an end.\n\nAllan Liska, a threat analyst at Recorded Future, said that because so many victims do not\ndisclose ransomware attacks it is hard to know if Conti was totally inactive in the first few\ndays after the leaks, but he said his firm had “definitely noticed a slowdown” in activity from\nConti.\n\nLiska said nothing was posted to Conti’s extortion sites — where the gang publicizes data\nbelonging to users who don’t pay ransoms — for a few days after the leaks began. However,\nLiska said Conti doesn’t post daily to the site even in normal circumstances so it is hard to\nknow for sure if the two events are linked.\n\nThe threat analysis community has been buzzing about Conti’s increasing network activity in\nthe past few days, Liska said. While Liska was unaware of the new data breaches disclosed\nby Kremez, he said he has heard about a recent increase in “attempted breaches or phishing\nemails being sent, things like that, that are indicative that they’re [Conti] still trying to gain\naccess.”\n\n“The botnet and the command and control activity is starting to tick back up,” Liska said.\n\nMuch of Conti’s infrastructure was down in the initial days after the chats leaked — at least\n25 different servers were exposed in the leaks, according to Liska, and those remain down.\nBut Liska said Conti’s “command and control” server is very large and not all of it has fallen.\n\nLiska said he estimates that Conti has between 50 and 100 servers running at any time,\nmaking the 25 or so that have been taken down a survivable injury. In recent days, Liska\nsaid, Conti has used the same software that powered the old infrastructure and simply\nmoved everything to new Internet Protocol addresses.\n\n### A history of resilience\n\n\n-----\n\nMany experts said they are unsurprised by Conti s staying power. As a collective whose\nmembers are highly skilled and anonymous even to each other, nothing short of a law\nenforcement takedown will truly put them out of business, experts said.\n\nJohn Shier, a senior security adviser at the hardware and software security firm Sophos, said\nthat other ransomware collectives have bounced back from seemingly devastating blows.\n\n“Whenever one of these groups gets gets disrupted, the temptation is to celebrate a little bit,\nbut there’s always going to be that okay, well, what’s next?” Shier said. “Where are they\ngoing to pop up next, under what kind of new model potentially are they going to pop up?\nBecause these groups can be fairly resilient.”\n\nShier said Conti’s bitcoin wallet reportedly had about $2 billion in it, a figure he called\n“staggering.” It’s also a figure that compels groups like Conti to rise from the dead. Emsisoft\nthreat analyst Brett Callow put it bluntly: Ransomware, he said, is “so massively profitable it\nisn’t going to go away quickly or easily.”\n\nLiska and Shier agreed on one thing that will likely change as a result of the leaks:\nCybercriminals may be more careful about taking on as many affiliates as they have in the\npast to counter security risks. In the affiliate ransomware model, gangs loan their malware to\nother hackers in exchange for a share of profits.\n\nThe Conti chat leaker is known to be a Ukrainian security researcher and not an affiliate,\naccording to Kremez. But seeing the ease with which the Conti chats were leaked, as well as\nthe damage they caused, will doubtlessly cause more gangs to think twice about sharing\nsensitive information with far-flung affiliates whom they don’t know as well as core gang\nmembers, Shier and Liska predicted.\n\nShier said he was struck by the fact that nearly 70 people participated in one of the Conti\nchats.\n\n“That’s a lot of people and not all of them were likely to be Russian citizens living in Russia,”\nShier said. “If the people who are the principles behind Conti believe in their geopolitical\nagenda of supporting Russia, and they want to prevent others who don’t share that view\nwithin their group from causing harm to the group, I can only see them severing ties with\nthem. They can still be successful without affiliates — they just won’t make as much money.”\n\nEven if Conti sheds affiliates and scales down in response to the leaks, the gang won’t be\nput out of business until the Russian government pursues criminal charges or allows the U.S.\ngovernment to do so, experts said.\n\n“The core members that are in Russia, are going to be insulated from any kind of prosecution\nor anything that comes from outside of Russia,” Shier said. “Nothing will be the end of them\nuntil the Russian government allows them to be investigated and prosecuted.”\n\n\n-----\n\nShier said it is possible Conti will rebrand under another name, but the group will live another\nday with the same leadership it has now.\n\n“I don’t see there being any kind of incentive for the Russian government to do anything with\nthem right now,” Shier said.\n\nJust Monday, Shier said, Conti posted four new data dumps for entities which didn’t pay\nransoms on their extortion site. There were other data dumps posted on Saturday and\nSunday, he said.\n\nKremez said Conti may lose some members, but they will revamp and come back stronger\nbecause they “learn from mistakes.”\n\nKremez said that in some ways the leaked chats will hurt the effort to snuff out Conti. He said\nhe expects gang members will change aliases so they will be more difficult to track. The\ngang will update its infrastructure. It will cut affiliates who are deemed too risky.\n\n“They will reemerge more powerful and better than ever and more bulletproof,” Kremez said.\n“They will adapt, they will improve, some members will relocate. But they [Conti] will\ndefinitely not be pushed out of the market.”\n\n\n-----",
