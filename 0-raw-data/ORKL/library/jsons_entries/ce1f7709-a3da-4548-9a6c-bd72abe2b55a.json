As early as\nFebruary 2020, we began observing an increase in malicious activity. In April, one of the largest\ncyber attacks targeting Taiwan in 2020 was the targeted attack on the CPC Corporation — a\nstate-owned petroleum, natural gas, and gasoline company and the largest gasoline supplier in\nTaiwan with roughly 25% of the gas stations on the island nation.\n\nCPC Corporation wasn’t alone; ten more organizations in critical infrastructure were also\ntargeted for attack that exact same weekend.\n\n## Incident Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 4, multiple CPC (台灣中油股份有限公司) gas stations across Taiwan suddenly became\nunable to accept payment by CPC VIP cards or electronic transaction apps. Customers had to\npay in cash or by credit card until the payment system was up again.\n\nFig. A —\nIn the beginning, the state-run CPC denied allegations of being hacked and having their\nsystems compromised. In truth, the CPC had been the victim of a targeted ColdLock\nransomware attack.\n\nOn May 15, (ten days after the CPC incident), the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice\n(MJIB) released an investigation report stating that the CPC was one of more than ten victims in\nthis sophisticated and organized ColdLock ransomware attack. The unnamed ten included\n\n\n-----\n\nother organizations in Taiwan s critical infrastructure, even a large multinational semiconductor\nvendor.\n\nFig. B —\n**CPC Corporation is not our customer; however, we were involved in investigations**\nregarding other critical infrastructure (CI) victims of the attack’s unnamed ten.\n\nThis successful, sophisticated attack targeted CI on a national scale, denied service across the\ncountry, interrupted the daily life of the common citizen, and brought brief but significant\neconomic turmoil.\n\n## Incident Timeline\n\n\n-----\n\nThis timeline was constructed by combining the findings from our own investigation and an\nanalysis of the threat intelligence presented in the MJIB report.\n\nFig. C — CPC Incident Timeline\n**Prior to April 26 — The attackers gain initial access and escalate privileges. They have**\ndecided (or planned) to wait before acting on their objectives.\n\n**April 26 — The attackers initiate their attack just before midnight.**\n\n**April 27 — The first backdoor is installed.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**April 28 & 30 — While the attackers were not directly active in the victim s environment on**\nthese days, GPO was leveraged by the attackers to automate the distribution of the\nransomware throughout the entire system from April 28 to the day of the attack.\n\n**April 29 — The second backdoor is installed under a different file with the same name but with**\na different hash. This second backdoor becomes the main backdoor used in the operation.\n\n**May 1 to 3 — Extended holiday weekends, like the Labor Day holiday weekend, are generally**\nconsidered an ideal time for cyberattacks as most technicians or security analysts would be on\nvacation, increasing both detection and response time. The Labor Day holiday weekend was,\nunfortunately, an ideal time for GPO to automate the distribution of the ransomware throughout\nthe entire system, maximizing the number of affected endpoints for the day of the attack.\n\n**May 4 — CPC initially claims a mere system crash; however, as talks of ransomware quickly**\nbegin to surface, CPC admits to being victim to a ransomware attack. As CPC is considered\ncritical infrastructure for the country, citizens are gravely concerned about the CPC attack.\nHowever, unbeknown to the general public, several other organizations had been targeted as\nwell.\n\n**May 4 to 6 — The attackers launch attacks against their other intended targets one after**\nanother. Their attack procedure remains the same; backdoors are installed before midnight,\nGPO distributes the ransomware throughout the targeted system, and the ransomware begins\nencrypting and deleting data just after 12 noon of the following day.\n\n**May 6 —** [Chunghwa Telecom announces it has been breached and releases IoCs and other](https://hisecure.hinet.net/secureinfo/popup.php?cert_id=HiNet-2020-0046)\nrelevant threat intelligence. Chunghwa Telecom is the largest telecommunications company and\nthe incumbent local exchange carrier of PSTN, Mobile, and broadband services in Taiwan.\nTheir report is the first report of this operation that contained IOCs, which were later used to\nattribute the same threat actor for the attacks on Chunghwa Telecom, CPC, and our customer.\n\n**May 7 — The malware has been contained and eradicated; the CPC system begins operations**\nwithout further incident. Our future customer, who had not yet contacted us, follows their postintrusion playbook policies and begins performing clean reinstalls on all their endpoints.\n\n**May 15 — The MJIB issues both a press release and threat intelligence report of the CPC**\nattack.\n\n## System-Level Threat Hunting\n\nThe initial automated environment scan of our customer’s environment, which consisted of 7\nthousand endpoints and 382.9 million files, immediately identified 4 suspicious endpoints and 3\nsuspicious files as a severe threat to the environment. Level 10 threats (as were these) are\nconsidered by the CyCraft AIR platform as the most malicious threats an environment could\npossibly face.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll information in this blog and our report has gone through de-identification and\nanonymization.\n\nFig. D — Screenshot of CyCraft AIR’s automated report of our customer’s environment —\nallowing our human security analyst teams to then focus and drill down into specific queries. All\ninformation in this blog and our report has gone through de-identification and anonymization.\n\n## Findings\n\nBy referencing the published threat intelligence from both Chunghwa Telecom and the MJIB\nwith the intelligence from our own investigation, we concluded that our customer was also\ntargeted by the same threat actors behind both the CPC and Chunghwa Telecom attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen our investigation began, all AD servers had already had a clean reinstall of their OS;\nhowever, three system admin endpoints (JOHN706_NB, MIS201_NB, MIS312_NB) still\ncontained artifacts, including backdoors that were still connected to malicious C2 servers\n(64[.]64.234.24 and 104[.]233.224.227).\n\nFig. E — CyCraft AIR Cyber Situation Graph\nThe backdoor malware (CDPSSVC.DLL) discovered in the system admin endpoint had the\nexact same hash as the one in the Chunghwa Telecom IoC Report.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. F — CyCraft AIR screenshot of known malware found on customer endpoint\nThe two IP addresses (64[.]64.234.24 and 104[.]233.224.227) were also both listed as\nmalicious C2 servers in the Chunghwa Telecom IoC Report.\n\nFurther investigation into the system admin endpoint, MIS201_NB, revealed CobaltStrike\nBeacon malware that had both identical malware hashes and C2 addresses as those listed in\nthe Chunghwa Telecom.\n\n## Actions on Objectives\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attackers had gained high-privileged access into the target system at least one week prior\nto the attack; however, there is a strong likelihood the target system had been compromised\neven months before May 4.\n\nThe attackers had scheduled the backdoor malware, dewm.exe and qwins5.exe, to be installed\non the system admin endpoints at precisely 11:46 p.m. on April 26 and 12:00 a.m. on April 27.\n\nFig. G — CyCraft AIR cyber situation graph of malicious (pink) processes. Notice the time\nstamp on each malicious process.\n73 minutes later, at 1:01 a.m. on April 27, the attackers acted again and installed the main\nbackdoor program (CDPSSVC.DLL) onto the system admin endpoint. Fig. H shows that in\naddition to install.bat, the attackers also issued several more commands. Unfortunately, only\n\n\n-----\n\nCDPSSVC.DLL remained on the endpoint we investigated as the other files had been removed\nby the previously mentioned clean reinstall.\n\nFig. H — CyCraft AIR cyber situation graph — endpoint process tree\nIn this process tree (Fig. H), the attackers use “reg add” to add a registry in the services called\nCDPSsvc and install service by the “sc create” command.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. J — CyCraft AIR cyber situation graph — endpoint process tree\nIt’s important to note that the backdoor malware and the ransomware are separate. A few\nmoments after installing the main backdoor malware, at 1:01 a.m. on Monday, April 27, the\nattackers used the GPO to distribute the ransomware throughout the entire system over the\nnext three business days and the 3-day Labor Day weekend. The ransomware then laid\ndormant and activated on Tuesday, May 5.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. K — lc.tmp PowerShell attacks executing CodeLock ransomware\nAlthough the ransomware started execution when the host endpoint was booted up on May 4,\nthe ransomware waited until 12:10 p.m. (Tuesday, May 5) to begin encrypting files and\ndestroying data. There are several reasons for this scheduled delay: it would be difficult for\nengineers and security analysts to respond immediately at this time, and it was the second day\nback after a long weekend.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. L — Encryption and Deletion did not begin until 12:10 in the afternoon.\nA closer look into the malware revealed this particular variant of ColdLock had removed all the\npayment information, contact email, and the RSA public key. This indicates that no information\ncould be provided for decryption.\n\n## Ransomware-as-a-Smokescreen\n\nRansomware incidents have dramatically increased in frequency, severity, and complexity ever\nsince the release of Bitcoin in 2009 as well as the numerous other cryptocurrencies that\nfollowed. This consistent and dramatic rise suggests that ransomware does work and attackers\ndo get paid.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, ransomware s increase in media and academic coverage has led to a relatively\nrecent development. Ransomware has become notorious enough that attackers have now\nbegun to weaponize the fear of ransomware, employing ransomware as a smokescreen for\nother malicious intents.\n\nIn terms of this particular incident, the existence of various versions of this particular\nransomware on VirusTotal (VT) and the lack of decrypting messages suggest that the attackers\nhad no intention of providing their victims a means of decrypting their encrypted files — yet\nanother reason why many cybersecurity vendors strongly recommend against paying\nransomware.\n\nIn addition to the lack of sophistication in the malware used in this attack, specific attacker\nbehavior proved inconsistent with observed behavior in previous ransomware attacks, such as\nthe decision to not delete volume shadow copies, as doing so would dramatically increase the\npossibility of recovery.\n\nAs this attack was also launched just one week before Taiwan’s presidential inauguration,\ntargeted multiple organizations in multiple industries, used a lack of sophisticated ransomware,\ndisplayed non-optimal attacker behavior, and was attributed to China-linked threat groups by\nthe FBI, the MJIB, and us, it becomes increasingly more likely that the end objective of this\nattack was not financial gain but political deterrence.\n\nThe ransomware was just a smokescreen used to confuse and delay investigators. The\nattackers had weaponized the fear of ransomware to deceive defenders and achieve their end\nobjectives.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CKⓇ Adversarial Technique Mapping\n\n Execution\n\nT1047 Windows Management Instrumentation\nT1053.002 Scheduled Task/Job: At (Windows)\nT1059.001 Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\nT1106 Native API\n\n## Persistence\n\nT1053.002 Scheduled Task/Job: At (Windows)\n\nT1543.003 Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service\n\n## Privilege Escalation\n\nT1053.002 Scheduled Task/Job: At (Windows)\nT1484 Group Policy Modification\nT1543.003 Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service\n\n\n-----\n\n## Defense Evasion\n\nT1070.004 Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion\nT1070.006 Indicator Removal on Host: Timestomp\nT1484 Group Policy Modification\nT1497.003 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion\nT1562.001 Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\n\n## Discovery\n\nT1007 System Service Discovery\n\nT1033 System Owner/User Discovery\n\nT1049 System Network Connections Discovery\nT1082 System Information Discovery\n\nT1083 File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1497.003 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion\n\n## Impact\n\nT1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\nT1489 Service Stop\n\n## Everything Starts From Security\n\nCyCraft Customers can prevent cyber intrusions from escalating into business-altering\nincidents.
