Seaduke (detected by Symantec as Trojan.Seaduke) is a low-](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-031915-4935-99&tabid=2)\nprofile information-stealing Trojan which appears to be reserved for attacks against a small\nnumber of high-value targets.\n\nSeaduke has been used in attacks against a number of major, government-level targets.\nThe malware hides behind numerous layers of encryption and obfuscation and is capable of\nquietly stealing and exfiltrating sensitive information such as email from the victim’s\ncomputer. Seaduke has a highly configurable framework and Symantec has already found\nhundreds of different configurations on compromised networks. Its creators are likely to\nhave spent a considerable amount of time and resources in preparing these attacks and the\nmalware has been deployed against a number of high-level government targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the Duke group began to distribute Cozyduke in an increasingly aggressive manner,\nSeaduke installations were reserved only for select targets. Seaduke victims are generally\nfirst infected with Cozyduke and, if the computer appears to be a target of interest, the\noperators will install Seaduke.\n\n**Background**\nThe group behind Seaduke is a cyberespionage operation that is responsible for a series of\nattacks against high-profile individuals and organizations in government, international policy\nand private research in the United States and Europe. It has a range of malware tools at its\n[disposal, known as the Dukes, including Cozyduke (Trojan.Cozer), Miniduke](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-030500-0430-99&tabid=2)\n[(Backdoor.Miniduke) and Cosmicduke (Backdoor.Tinybaron).](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-030119-2820-99http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-030119-2820-99)\n\nNews of the Duke group first emerged in March and April of 2015, when reports detailing\n[attacks involving a sophisticated threat actor variously called Office Monkeys, EuroAPT,](http://malware.prevenity.com/2015/03/euroapt.html)\n[Cozy Bear, and](http://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/przytulny-mis-w-natarciu-kampania-cozy-bear-atakuje-takze-polske/) [Cozyduke were](http://securelist.com/blog/69731/the-cozyduke-apt/) [published. Symantec believes that this group has a history](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030745/CozyDuke)\nof compromising governmental and diplomatic organizations since at least 2010.\n\n[The group began its current campaign as early as March 2014, when Trojan.Cozer (aka](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-030500-0430-99&tabid=2)\nCozyduke) was identified on the network of a private research institute in Washington, D.C.\nIn the months that followed, the Duke group began to target victims with “Office Monkeys”and “eFax”-themed emails, booby-trapped with a Cozyduke payload. These tactics were\natypical of a cyberespionage group. It’s quite likely these themes were deliberately chosen\nto act as a smokescreen, hiding the true intent of the adversary.\n\n_Figure 1. Cozyduke campaign used an “Office Monkeys” video as a lure–July 2014_\n\nThe Duke group has mounted an extended campaign targeting high-profile networks over\nextended periods, something which is far beyond the reach of the majority of threat actors.\nIts capabilities include:\n\nAttack infrastructure leveraging hundreds of compromised websites\nRapidly developed malware frameworks in concurrent use\nSophisticated operators with fine-tuned computer network exploitation (CNE) skills\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough Cozyduke activity was first identified in March 2014, it wasn t until July that the\ngroup managed to successfully compromise high-profile government networks. Cozyduke\nwas used throughout these attacks to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive information to the\nattackers.\n\nIn parallel, the Duke group was also installing separate malware onto these networks,\nnamely [Backdoor.Miniduke and the more elusive Trojan.Seaduke. It could use these](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-030119-2820-99http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-030119-2820-99)\npayloads to exploit networks on multiple fronts and providing it with additional persistence\nmechanisms.\n\n**The Miniduke payload**\nIn July of 2014, the group instructed Cozyduke-infected computers to install\n[Backdoor.Miniduke onto a compromised network. Miniduke has been the group’s tool of](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-030119-2820-99http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-030119-2820-99)\nchoice for a number of years in espionage operations predominantly targeting government\nand diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe and ex-Soviet states. “Nemesis Gemina” appears\nto be the internal name for the framework used by the group to identify the project,\n[previously reported by Kaspersky.](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/64107/miniduke-is-back-nemesis-gemina-and-the-botgen-studio/)\n\nThe following debug string was present in the sample used in these attacks:\n\nC:\\Projects\\nemesis-gemina\\nemesis\\bin\\carriers\\ezlzma_x86_exe.pdb\n\n[This project name has been seen in Backdoor.Tinybaron (aka Cosmicduke) samples, which](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-052717-4610-99&tabid=2)\nSymantec also attributes to the Duke group. This deployment of Miniduke and the technical\nsimilarities with Cozyduke provided strong indicators as to who was behind the attacks.\n\n**The Seaduke payload**\nThese attacks were already well underway when another group began to deploy a\npreviously unknown piece of malware. In October 2014, the Seaduke payload began to\nappear within target networks. Although Seaduke was developed in Python, the overall\nframework bears a striking resemblance to Cozyduke in terms of operation. It’s unclear why\nthe attackers waited until October to deploy Seaduke. Was it reserved for a more specific\nattack? Was part of their cover blown, necessitating the use of an alternative framework?\n\nThe Seaduke framework was designed to be highly configurable. Hundreds of\nreconfigurations were identified on compromised networks. The communication protocol\nemployed had many layers of encryption and obfuscation, using over 200 compromised\nweb servers for command and control. Seaduke required a significant investment of time\nand resources in the preparatory and operational phases of the attack.\n\n**Seaduke delivery**\nThe attackers control Cozyduke via compromised websites, issuing instructions to infected\nmachines by uploading “tasks” to a database file. Cozyduke will periodically contact these\n\n\n-----\n\nwebsites to retrieve task information to be executed on the local machine. One such task\n(an encoded PowerShell script) instructed Cozyduke to download and execute Seaduke\nfrom a compromised website.\n\n_Figure 2. How the attacker tasks Cozer to install Seaduke_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Seaduke operation**\nThe attackers can operate Seaduke in a broadly similar fashion to Cozyduke. The Seaduke\ncontrol infrastructure is essentially distinct, opening up the possibility of sub-teams\nconcurrently exploiting the target network. Unlike Cozyduke, Seaduke operators upload\n“task” files directly to the command-and-control (C&C) server; there is no database as such\npresent. Seaduke securely communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS beneath\nlayers of encoding (Base64) and encryption (RC4, AES). To an untrained eye, the\ncommunications look fairly benign, no doubt an effort to stay under the radar on\ncompromised networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. How Seaduke operates on the target network_\n\nSeaduke has many inbuilt commands which are available to the attackers. They have the\nability to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update bot configuration, upload files,\ndownload files, and self-delete the malware from the system. The self-delete function is\n[interestingly called “seppuku”. This is a form of Japanese ritual suicide.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku)\n\n**Seaduke payloads**\n\nThe attackers have also developed a number of additional payloads. Operators can push\nthese payloads onto infected machines for very specific attacks.\n\nImpersonation using Kerberos pass-the-ticket attacks (Mimikatz PowerShell)\nEmail extraction from the MS Exchange Server using compromised credentials\nArchiving sensitive information\nData exfiltration via legitimate cloud services\nSecure file deletion\n\n**What next?**\n\nThe Duke group has brought its operational capability to the next level. Its attacks have\nbeen so bold and aggressive, that a huge amount of attention has been drawn to it, yet it\nappears to be unperturbed. Its success at compromising such high-profile targets has no\ndoubt added a few feathers to its cap. Even the developers reveled in this fact, naming one\nof Seaduke’s functions “forkmeiamfamous”.\n\nWhile the group is currently keeping a lower profile, there’s no doubt it will reappear. Some\ntools may have to be abandoned, some reworked and others built completely from scratch.\nThis attack group is in it for the long haul.\n\n\n-----",
