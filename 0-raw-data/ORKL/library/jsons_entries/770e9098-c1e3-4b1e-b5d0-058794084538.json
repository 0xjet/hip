The group,](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-061312-4916-99)\nknown to Symantec as Tick, has maintained a low profile, appearing to be active for at least\n10 years prior to discovery.\n\nIn its most recent campaign, Tick employed spear-phishing emails and compromised a\nnumber of Japanese websites in order to infect a new wave of victims. The group is highly\nselective in its approach and only appears to deploy its full range of tools once it establishes\nthat the compromised organization is an intended target. Tick also uses a range of\nhacktools to map the victim’s network and attempt to escalate privileges further.\n\n\n-----\n\nDaserf s main purpose is information stealing and the Trojan is capable of gathering\ninformation from infected computers and relaying it back to attacker-controlled servers.\nTick’s most recent attacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and\nbroadcasting sectors in Japan.\n\n**Recent attacks**\nSymantec discovered the most recent wave of Tick attacks in July 2015, when the group\ncompromised three different Japanese websites with a Flash (.swf) exploit to mount\nwatering hole attacks. Visitors to these websites were infected with a downloader known as\n[Gofarer (Downloader.Gofarer). Gofarer collects information about the compromised](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-120812-1148-99)\ncomputer and then downloads and installs Daserf.\n\nTick also used spear-phishing emails in these recent attacks. While Symantec did not find\nthe emails themselves, it did identify the use of an exploit designed to take advantage of a\n[vulnerability in Microsoft Office documents (CVE-2014-4114). This was used to distribute](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-4114)\nmalware in addition to the watering hole activity.\n\n**Tick under the microscope**\nDaserf appears to be custom-developed for use in Tick’s cyberespionage campaigns. Once\ninstalled, it establishes a remote connection to Tick’s command and control server,\nproviding the attacker with access to the compromised computer.\n\n_Figure 1. Chain of infection seen in recent Japanese attacks_\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the malware is installed on a targeted computer, the attackers attempt to enumerate\nthe network and escalate their privilege level. To do this, Tick uses a number of publicly\navailable hacktools such as Mimikatz, GSecdump, and Windows Credential Editor. The\ntools are downloaded and deployed to the original install directory previously created by the\nmalware.\n\nTick’s primary objective appears to be the theft of sensitive information from targeted\nJapanese organizations. To date, Symantec has observed the group attempting to steal\nemails and documents such as PowerPoint presentations.\n\n**Low-profile threat**\nThe Daserf Trojan employs a number of tactics to avoid detection. Once collected, the\nstolen data is hidden in password-protected .rar archives.\n\nDaserf also uses file and folder names related to legitimate programs often found in\nWindows environments in order to blend in. Observed folder names include HP, Intel,\nAdobe, and perflogs and folders are generally created in either the root drive or the\nApplication Data or Program Files folders. File names used in recent attacks include\nadobe.exe, adobe_sl.exe, intel.exe, and intellog.exe.\n\n**Command and control servers**\nTick uses compromised web servers to distribute malware and, in some instances, for its\ncommand and control (C&C) infrastructure. However, in most cases, it relies on its own\ninfrastructure for C&C purposes.\n\nIn its most recent campaigns, the group registered the domains used for C&C servers days\nafter the malware was compiled. For example, one of the variants of Daserf used was\ncompiled on July 8, 2015. This sample was seen contacting the C&C domain\nwww[.]dreamsig[.]com, which was first registered on July 13, 2015, five days after the\ncompilation date. This pattern occurred in multiple Daserf samples.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the communication between the malware and the C&C\ninfrastructure is how the malware changes the URL from a randomly chosen variable\nselected from a predefined list.\n\n**Predefined list from Daserf MD5: 765017E16842C9EB6860A7E9F711B0DB**\n\nrjdyw.asp\n\nxszgj.asp\n\ndheyf.asp\n\nejdhf.asp\n\ngxbne.asp\n\n\n-----\n\n**Predefined list from Daserf MD5: 765017E16842C9EB6860A7E9F711B0DB**\n\nswetf.asp\n\nqgfhr.asp\n\nwhjdh.asp\n\nzgfer.asp\n\ncshyr.asp\n\nfxkle.asp\n\ntmwry.asp\n\nviksr.asp\n\nycghw.asp\n\n_Table 1. An example of how a Daserf sample uses a predefined list of URLs embedded in_\n_the malware_\n\nSymantec identified multiple C&C domains used by Tick. Unfortunately, Tick frequently used\neither privacy protection services or domain brokers to mask registration information. These\ntactics are used to make discovery and attribution more difficult.\n\n**C&C domain** **Parent hash**\n\ncharlie-harada[.]com 122652ca6ef719f8ba2d8d412ea184fe\n\nisozaki.sakura.ne[.]jp 4601e75267d0dcfe4256c43f45ec470a\n\nwww.aucsellers[.]com 7ec173d469c2aa7a3a15acb03214256c\n\nwww.lunwe[.]com 8d5bf506e55ab736f4c018d15739e352\n\nc-saika[.]jp 3fa5965a1de2c095de38f22f0645af3e\nb33f4b8e776b94dc48c234ce9897cf74\n\nkcm-store[.]com 63fe9f06068823b02b925e4a74a57db0\n\nhtpc[.]jp a629926313ee12163e1bdd2bb633e0e2\nd3031438d80913f21ec6d3078dc77068\n\nrlsolar[.]jp d3031438d80913f21ec6d3078dc77068\n\n_Table 2. Examples of Tick C&C domains and associated MD5 hashes_\n\n\n-----\n\n**Stolen digital certificates used in selected cases**\nThe majority of the malware analyzed was not digitally signed. However, a small percentage\nwas signed with a stolen digital certificate. It is unclear why the certificate was used so\nsparingly, since signed malware would receive a greater level of trust and reduce the risk of\ndetection.\n\nIt is possible that the certificate was used against a target that had a secure environment\nwhich may have required binaries to be signed in order to interact with the operating\nsystem.\n\nThe issuer of the certificate has been informed of its misuse and confirmed that it would be\nrevoked.\n\n_Figure 2. The stolen digital certificate used to sign Tick malware_\n\n**Targets**\nThe use of compromised websites to infect victims results in unintentional infections,\nmaking it difficult to identify the motives of the attacker. By searching for evidence of postinfection activity, Symantec identified seven organizations where Tick had mounted\npersistent post-compromise attacks. These organizations were primarily large Japanese\ntechnology, engineering, and media firms.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Daserf infections by region_\n\nThe seven organizations therefore appear to be Tick’s intended targets. In addition to\nseeing post-compromise tools used in these attacks, the length of time the attackers were\nactive on the networks provided additional evidence that these were high-value targets. The\nlongest time Tick was active in a victim’s environment was 18 months. The average\ntimeframe was five months and the number of infected hosts in a victim’s network ranged\nfrom 3 to 15 systems.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTick has left a trail of evidence indicating that its activity began as early as 2006. In earlier\nattacks, the group used malicious Microsoft Word documents to infect victims, with\ncompromised websites being added to the mix as a more recent attack vector.\n\nTick appears to be a well-organized group, with the funding and capability to develop and\nupdate its malware. It has the ability to compromise legitimate infrastructure to use for\nmalware distribution and has access to stolen digital certificates to sign its malware when\nneeded. Tick primarily uses purchased infrastructure for its C&C servers and has been able\nto stay off the radar since 2006.\n\nTick exhibits all the hallmarks of an advanced cyberespionage group. The long lifespan of\nthe group, as well as the consistent targeted attacks against specific industries, support this\ntheory. The individuals or organization behind Tick’s operations has an interest in Japanese\ntechnology along with Japanese media and broadcasting organizations. While Tick’s tactics\nmay change over time, the group’s history indicates that its focus will continue to be a\nnarrow range of targets, mainly in Japan.\n\n**Protection**\nSymantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\n\n-----\n\n[System Infected: Backdoor.Daserf.B](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=27166)\n\n\n-----",
