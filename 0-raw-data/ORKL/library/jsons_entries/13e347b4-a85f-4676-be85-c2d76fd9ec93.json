They are well-known for conducting mass spam](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/02/cylanceprotect-vs-doppelpaymer-bitpaymer-and-dridex)\n[campaigns that use malicious document lures to deliver malware such as Dridex, Qakbot,](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2017/05/cylance-vs-qakbot-malware)\n[and WastedLocker.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/08/blackberry-protect-vs-wastedlocker-ransomware)\n\nSince February 2021, TA575 has deployed more than 50 Cobalt Strike team servers. These\nservers use unique values in their configurations that have allowed BlackBerry researchers\nto identify disparate infrastructure that had previously been flying under the radar.\n\nPortions of this infrastructure have been used by thousands of Cobalt Strike “Beacons” and\nmalicious document stagers across several distinct malspam campaigns. In more recent\n[offensives, such as the Fake Kaseya VSA phishing campaign first reported by Trustwave in](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/11/the-art-of-targeted-phishing-how-not-to-get-hooked)\nearly July, the team server infrastructure was used for staging further Dridex payloads.\n\n**BlackBerry Cyber Suite and BlackBerry Guard stop these attacks.**\n\n\n-----\n\n[BlackBerry customers can feel confident that our AI-driven BlackBerry® Cyber Suite, as well](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/blackberry-cyber-suite)\n[as our Managed Detection & Response (MDR) solution BlackBerry® Guard, are well-](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/services/blackberry-guard)\nequipped to mitigate the risks posed by threat actors such as TA575:\n\n[BlackBerry® Protect provides automated malware prevention, application and script](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/unified-endpoint-security/blackberry-protect)\ncontrol, memory protection, and device policy enforcement.\n[BlackBerry® Optics extends the threat prevention by using artificial intelligence (AI) to](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/unified-endpoint-security/blackberry-optics)\nprevent security incidents.
