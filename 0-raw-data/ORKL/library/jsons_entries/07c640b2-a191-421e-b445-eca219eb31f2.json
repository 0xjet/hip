The construction of the webshell was interesting by itself, as it was actually two separate\nwebshells: an initial webshell that was responsible for saving and loading the second fully functional webshell. It is this second webshell that\nenabled the threat actor to run a variety of commands on the compromised server. Due to these two layers, we use the name TwoFace to track\nthis webshell.\n\nDuring our analysis, we extracted the commands executed by the TwoFace webshell from the server logs on the compromised server. Our\nanalysis shows that the commands issued by the threat actor date back to June 2016; this suggests that the actor had access to this shell for\nalmost an entire year. The commands issued show the actor was interested in gathering credentials from the compromised server using the\nMimikatz tool. We also saw the attacker using the TwoFace webshell to move laterally through the network by copying itself and other\nwebshells to other servers.\n\n## Actor Activities using TwoFace\n\nThe web server logs on the system we examined that was compromised with the TwoFace shell gave us a glimpse into the commands the\nactor executed through their malware. These commands also enabled us to create a profile of the actor, specifically their intentions and the\ntools and techniques used to carry out their operation.\n\nOur analysis determined that five different IP addresses from four countries issued commands on the TwoFace shell, as seen in Table 1. As it\nis possible these originating IP address may themselves have been targeted and compromised, we have redacted the full IP addresses to hide\nthe identities. The first command in the logs was issued on June 18, 2016, which was a simple “whoami” command to get the username on the\nserver. This single command was the only one by this specific IP address which appears to be in Iran, and suggests that the actor may have\ninitially compromised the server around this time and performed a quick check to see if the shell was loaded successfully.\n\n**IP address** **Country** **Number of Commands** **Date of Activity** **Days Since Initial Command**\n\n46.38.x.x Iran 1 2016-06-18 0\n\n178.32.x.x France 6 2016-09-28 103\n\n137.74.x.x France 16 2017-03-03 259\n\n192.155.x.x USA 61 2017-04-24 311\n\n46.4.x.x Germany 10 2017-05-03 320\n\n_Table 1 IP Addresses seen issuing TwoFace Commands_\n\n\n-----\n\nee o t s a te t s s g e, t a co a d t e e t set o co a ds e e se t s t e o Septe be 8, 0 6 a se es o t e e\ncommands were sent from an IP address apparently in France. These commands provide additional insight into the actor’s intentions. It is not\ncertain why a time gap exists in issuing commands to the TwoFace webshell, although it is highly plausible this may simply be a visibility gap\nor even anti-detection measure taken by the actor. Rather than speculating on this gap and subsequent time gaps between interactions, we\nwill focus on the commands actor issued that provide insight into this actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n\nThe first command issued from this second IP address attempts to run a variant of the Mimikatz post-exploitation tool (m64.exe), specifically\nthe Sekurlsa module that gathers the passwords of accounts currently logged into the system and saves the results locally to a text file. The\nactor then issues a command that uses the “type” command to read the contents of the text file containing the passwords, followed by a\ncommand that uses “del” to delete the text file.\n\nc:\\windows\\temp\\m64.exe privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonpasswords exit > c:\\windows\\temp\\01.txt\n\nJust over five months later on March 3, 2017, a third IP address, a different one apparently in France, issued a series of 16 commands to the\nTwoFace webshell. The first command of interest is as follows:\n\nnet group \"Exchange Trusted Subsystem\" /domain\n\nAccording to [MSDN, the “Exchange Trusted Subsystem” group is defined as follows:](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd638106%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396)\n\n_The “Exchange Trusted Subsystem” is a highly privileged universal security group (USG) that has read/write access to every Exchange-related_\n_object in the Exchange organization. It’s also a member of the Administrators local security group and the Exchange Windows Permissions_\n_USG, which enables Exchange to create and manage Active Directory objects._\n\nUsing hostnames obtained from the previous command, the actor issues several commands to determine if they have access to Microsoft\nExchange related folders. The actor then issued several commands that attempt to copy a different webshell onto these additional systems,\nwhich resembles the following:\n\ncopy c:\\windows\\temp\\Exchange.aspx \"\\\\[hostname]\\d$\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V14\\ClientAccess\\exchweb\\ews\\\"\n\nThis clearly shows the threat actor attempting to use the TwoFace webshell to pivot to other servers on the network. The “Exchange.aspx” file\ncopied over to the other systems appears to be a different webshell from TwoFace. We analyzed this additional webshell and have named it\nIntrudingDivisor, which we will describe in detail later in this blog.\n\nOn April 24, 2017, a fourth IP address, this one apparently in the United States, issued 61 commands to the TwoFace webshell. Like the\nprevious set of commands issued in March 2017 from France, this IP address issued the command to obtain objects in the Exchange Trusted\nSubsystem group, and it appears the actor copied over yet another webshell named “global.aspx” and set the file’s attributes to be hidden\nusing the following command:\n\nattrib h \"\\\\[hostname]\\d$\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V14\\ClientAccess\\exchweb\\ews\\global.aspx\"\n\nThe actor then issued commands that suggests the use of the Mimikatz tool, but this time Mimikatz was named “mom64.exe” instead of\n“m64.exe”. The following two commands show the actor killing the process and using the “type” command to read the contents of a text file\n“01.txt,” which was also used in the password gathering activity observed on the day of the initial compromise on Jun 2016, ten months earlier:\n\ntaskkill /f /im mom64.exe\ntype c:\\windows\\temp\\01.txt\n\nNine days later on May 3, 2017 the next commands came from a fifth IP address apparently in Germany. This time the threat actors issued 10\ncommands to the TwoFace webshell: fewer than nine days before but still more than during the other sessions.\n\nThe actor first issues a command to ping the IP address “4.2.2.4”, which is the legitimate DNS resolver operated by Level 3. The actor then\nchecks the “Domain Admins” group to determine the accounts with domain administrator privileges using the following command:\n\nnet group \"Domain admins\" /domain\n\nAfter this command, the actor runs a variant of the Mimikatz tool to gather locally logged in passwords, this time using a filename of\n“MicrosoftUpdate.exe” for the executable and “mic.txt” to store the results, as seen in the following command:\n\nc:\\windows\\temp\\MicrosoftUpdate.exe p::d s::l q > c:\\windows\\temp\\mic.txt\n\nThese commands show the threat actors rely heavily on the TwoFace webshell to interact with compromised servers, but it also appears that\nother webshells are used in addition to TwoFace, such as IntrudingDivisor. The commands also show the threat actor’s reliance on the\nMimikatz tool to steal passwords from systems, which they will then use to attempt to move laterally amongst other servers by copying over\nwebshells. Lastly, the timestamps of the commands suggest that the threat actor had maintained persistent access that they used intermittently\nto the compromised network using the TwoFace shell since at least June 2016.\n\n## TwoFace Loader Shell\n\n\n-----\n\not co po e ts o t e o ace s e, c e e e to as t e oade a d pay oad co po e ts e e tte C# a d ea t to u o a\nwebserver that supports ASP.NET. The author of the initial loader webshell included legitimate and expected content that will be displayed if a\nvisitor accesses the shell in a browser. The inclusion of expected content suggests that the actors wished to use the TwoFace webshell for\nextended periods while remaining hidden.\n\nThe code in the loader webshell includes obfuscated variable names and the embedded payload is encoded and encrypted. To interact with\nthe loader webshell, the threat actor uses HTTP POST requests to the compromised server. As its name suggests, the loader component is\nmainly responsible for saving and loading the payload component on the same server, allowing the actor to interact with the payload\ncomponent that has far more functionality than the loader. However, the loader is also capable of the following functionality:\n\nSave the TwoFace payload to a specified file on the server\nDelete the TwoFace payload saved on the server\nWrite data to a specified file on the server\nDelete the entire folder on the server used to store the TwoFace payload\n\nThe TwoFace loader parses the HTTP POST requests issued by the actor and references data at specific locations, more specifically at\ncertain indexes within the posted data (C# “Request.Forms”) that the shell will use to determine the functionality the actor wishes to execute.\nWhile we did not have logs of HTTP requests for the loader shell, we were able to determine some of the indexes that the webshell will\nspecifically access within the data. Table 2 shows the known indexes within the HTTP POST data that TwoFace references.\n\n\n**Request.Forms**\n**Index**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n0 If set to a specific value (for example, \"931201\"), it creates a set of \"pre\" html tags with a string of numbers for reasons\nunknown.\n\n5 Data to write to a file on the server\n\n8 String name for the TwoFace webshell filename\n\n9 Contains base64 data provided by the actor to specify the command to run, as well as the decryption key in the event\nthe actor wishes to load the webshell\n\n_Table 2 Indexes within Request.Forms that the TwoFace loader relies on_\n\nAs you can see in the descriptions in Table 2, none of these locations contain the command that the actor wishes to execute. Instead, the actor\nmust provide data in index 9 that was constructed to not only contain the command the actor wants to execute, but also contains the key to\ndecrypt the TwoFace payload component that is embedded within the loader. The data in index 9 will contain data at specific offsets, seen in\nTable 3 that the loader component will use to determine the command and the location of command specific data within the posted data (C#\n“Request.Forms”).\n\n**Offset** **Value** **Description**\n\n0 Varied The entirety of the data is used as a key to decrypt the TwoFace payload component\n\n25 8 Specifies the argument in the HTTP POST request that contains the string of the filename for the TwoFace webshell file\n\n26 1000 Minimum length required to write data to a specified file\n\n44 31 Contains the number of arguments needed to perform a file deletion operation?\n\n45 5 Specifies the argument within the POST request that contains the data to write to a file on the server\n\n57 36 Contains the number of arguments within the POST request to run a command to write data to a file on the server\n\n61 13 Contains the number of arguments within the POST request to run a command to install the TwoFace payload webshell\n\n63 14 Contains the number of arguments needed to perform a folder deletion operation?\n\n_Table 3 Offets of actor provided data used by the TwoFace loader_\n\n## Saving the TwoFace Payload\n\nThe main purpose of the loader shell is to install a secondary webshell on demand. The secondary webshell, which we call the payload, is\nembedded within the loader in encrypted form and contains additional functionality that we will discuss in further detail. When the threat actor\nwants to interact with the remote server, they provide data that the loader will use to modify a decryption key embedded within the loader that\nwill be in turn used to decrypt the embedded TwoFace payload. The decryption algorithm (below) is very simple, as it relies on basic arithmetic\noperations, specifically addition and subtraction to decrypt the embedded payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nfor(int i = 0; i &lt; key.Length; i++)\nkey[i] += actorProvidedData[i % actorProvidedData.Length];\nfor(int j=0;j&lt;ciphertext.Length;j++)\nciphertext[j] -= key[j % key.Length];\n\n\nThe pseudocode above provides the logic used by the TwoFace loader to decrypt the ciphertext of the payload, which is\n\n1. Iterate through the key, modifying each byte by adding a value from the actor’s provided data\n2. Iterate through TwoFace payload ciphertext and subtracting each byte using a value from the modified key\n\nWe were able to determine the data that the threat actor would have to provide to successfully decrypt the embedded TwoFace payload, which\nis as follows:\n\n\\x15@^\\xbbs\\xfa\\xae\\x876\\x03`\\xffs\\x89\\xb9\n\\x9a\\xcb\\x02\\xec\\x8e\\xc3\\x92\\x7f\\xd6b\\xa8\\x1ag\\xb8\\xff\\x82\\x08\\xd0ALB\\xd8\\x0c)\\x91\\x82\\xc4\\x85\\xb2\\xa7\\xe6\\xea\\x8e\\x92\\xf9u\\x96\\xc1\\xef\\xfd\\x\n\nAs you can surmise from the above characters, this does not appear to be a human generated string. We believe this is a machine generated\nstring used for this input data, which gives a bit of insight into the actors behind this webshell, as they would have to use a tool to interact with\nto automate the use of these webshells, or at a minimum they would need to keep track of these machine generated user input strings to be\nable to interact with their webshells manually.\n\n## TwoFace Payload Shell\n\nThe TwoFace payload shell requires a password that is sent within HTTP POST data or within the HTTP Cookie, specifically with a field with a\nname “pwd”. The “pwd” field is used for authentication as a password, which the payload will generate the SHA1 hash and compare it with a\nhash that is hardcoded within the payload. We extracted the SHA1 hashes used for authentication from the known TwoFace shells, as seen in\nTable 4 and were able to find the associated password string for three of them. One of the passwords, “RamdanAlKarim12” contains a phrase\nthat means “Ramadan the generous” in Arabic (رﻣﻀﺎن اﻟﻜﺮﯾﻢ). Another known password is “FreeMe!”, while the last known password contains\nwhat may be an acronym of a middle eastern energy organization followed by “pass”. It is possible that the actor chose this acronym based on\nthe targeted organization, but we cannot confirm this.\n\n**Sample SHA256** **Embedded SHA1 Password**\n\n8f0419493d… a2c9afd6adac242827adb00d76c20c491b2d2247\n\n0a77e28e6d… 6a0e681586988388d4a0690b6fb686715d92d069\n\n54c8bfa0be… 5e1c37bf3bd8a7567d46db63ed9b0aeed53e57fe\n\n818ac924fd… 37ada887553cf48715cc19131b8e661ac43718e9\n\nfd47825d75… 9789b5c0c13fb58c423bce5577873d413d9494be\n\n79c9a2a2b5… c56bc0d331a825fdea01c5437877d5e9e1cda2c4\n\ne33096ab3… 9f4e10484f4ceac34878d4f621a1ad8e580fd02a\n\nc116f078a0… 57dd9721f9837ebd24dea55a90a2a9e3e6ad6f1e\n\n_Table 4 Authentication hashes and matching password strings used for TwoFace webshells_\n\nMuch like the authentication password, a threat actor can issue commands to the TwoFace payload using either data sent within the HTTP\nCookie or HTTP POST data itself. If using an HTTP Cookie to issue commands, the payload will split the cookie data using the delimiter “#=#”\nand will treat the first value as the command and the second value the data to pass to the command. We enumerated the command handler,\nwhich can be seen in Table 5 that accepts a variety of commands to interact with the compromised server.\n\n**Command** **Arg Field** **Description**\n\n\nExecute application\nor command\n\n\npro Executable to run command line commands\n\n\ncmd Runs a supplied command using “cmd.exe” or another executable\nsupplied by the user via the “pro” field within the HTTP POST data.\n\n\nUpload a file to the\nserver\n\n\nupl Field name within the HTTP POST files that\ncontains the file contents to save to the server\n\n\nsav Path to save file to\n\nvir Boolean to save a file to a virtual path rather than a physical path\n\n\n-----\n\nnen Specified name of file to upload, otherwise the script uses the\nfilename of the uploaded file from the HTTP POST request\n\n\nUpload data to a file\nin the %TEMP%\nfolder\n\n\nupb Base64 encoded data that is decoded and\nsaved to a file\n\n\nupd Filename in the %TEMP% folder to save ‘upb’ data to\n\n\nDelete a file in\n%TEMP% folder\n\nDownload a file from\nthe server\n\nView or set MAC\ntimestamps of a file\n\n\ndel Filename in the %TEMP% folder to delete\n\ndon Path to file to download from the server\n\nhid 1 = View the ‘tfil’ MAC times\n2 = Set ‘tfil’ file MAC times to match the file\nspecified in the ‘ttar’ field\n\n3 = Set ‘tfil’ file MAC times to times specified\nin the ‘ttim’ field\n\n\ntfil Filename to get or set MAC times\n\nttar Filename to get MAC times, most likely a legitimate filename used\nto make uploaded files look as if they are legitimate\n\nttim Specific timestamp to set file MAC times to\n\n_Table 5 Commands available within the TwoFace payload webshell_\n\nWhile the commands within Table 5 are available within TwoFace, the threat actor does not have to manually issue these requests within\nHTTP POST data, as the actor can interact with the webshell using a web form within the browser. We set up an IIS server to test the TwoFace\nwebshell, which displays the user-interface seen in Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1 TwoFace payload webshell before authentication_\n\nAt first, the text box in the row labeled “Login” has a red background, which means the user has not successfully provided the password\nrequired to issue commands to the webshell. After entering the correct password in the login box, the box changes from a red to green\nbackground, as seen in Figure 2. The actor can now interact with the compromised server using the webshell, which runs the commands\n\n\n-----\n\ndesc bed ab e 5 ost cases, t e output o esu ts o co a ds a e d sp ayed ed ate y be o t e ebs e o sta ce, gu e\n2 we issued the “whoami” command that used the Windows command-prompt to display the name of the current user account below the\nwebshell.\n\n_Figure 2 Issuing a command on TwoFace webshell after successfully authenticating_\n\n## TwoFace++ Loader\n\nWe discovered another version of the TwoFace loader shell that was structurally similar to the TwoFace loader shell discussed in this blog, as\nthis version of TwoFace also contains an embedded payload shell in encrypted form. To use the embedded payload shell, the actor must\nprovide a password that the loader shell will not only use for authentication, but also as a key to decrypt the payload.\n\nThe actor will provide the password in the HTTP POST data, specifically as a base64 encoded string within a field labeled “p”. The TwoFace++\nloader will decode this password and concatenate a static salt value and compute the SHA1 hash of this string. The loader then base64\nencodes the SHA1 hash and compares it with a hardcoded base64 encoded string of a SHA1 hash needed for successful authentication. We\nknow of the SHA1 hashes 19be2493b7cc2d43e8bf245b6faf2c747be6bae5 and 26749c6b5308bb668eb954f4120607c2a9d620be used for\nauthentication, however, we have been unable to determine the passwords that would result in these hashes.\n\nThe TwoFace++ loader will use the actor provided password as a decryption key to decrypt the embedded payload shell. The loader will use\nthe first 24 bytes of the actor’s password as a key, which it will use the 3DES symmetric cipher to decrypt the payload shell. The embedded\npayload is 8624 bytes, which we believe is another webshell based on the previous version of the TwoFace loader, however, we have been\nunable to decrypt the payload to confirm.\n\n## IntrudingDivisor Webshell\n\nOur analysis of the commands issued to the TwoFace webshell resulted in the discovery of another webshell that we call IntrudingDivisor. Like\nTwoFace, the IntrudingDivisor webshell requires the threat actor to authenticate before issuing commands. To authenticate, the actor must\nprovide two pieces of information, first an integer that is divisible by 5473 and a string whose MD5 hash is\n“9A26A0E7B88940DAA84FC4D5E6C61AD0”. Upon successful authentication, the webshell has a command handler that uses integers within\nthe request to determine the command to execute, specifically integers divisible by the following:\n\n**Divisor** **Command**\n\n6571 Write provided data to a specified file\n\n9273 Execute a command or change the modified and access times of a file\n\n3471 Read a specified file\n\n_Table 6 Commands available within the IntrudingDivisor webshell_\n\n\n-----\n\ne ebs e ogs t e, use age t, a d t esta p o a equests to a e a ed 5 53 U e e, but e a e see a ot e\nIntrudingDivisor sample logging requests to “KB76862-ENU.exe” as well. We believe the threat actor will use the IntrudingDivisor in a similar\nmanner to TwoFace, specifically to gain access to additional servers during lateral movement and to gather user credentials.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe TwoFace webshell has an effective two-layer approach that makes it difficult to detect. Coupled with the multiple layers and inclusion of\nlegitimate website content that displays correctly in the browser, the threat actors are able to enjoy long periods of persistent access to a\nnetwork without detection as evidenced by their demonstrated ability to access and manipulate a compromised system for nearly a year.\nBased on the commands issued to TwoFace, the threat actors used this webshell to deliver variants of the Mimikatz tool to gather the\npasswords of logged on accounts. The actor also used TwoFace to move laterally by copying webshells to other remote systems on the\nnetwork.\n\n**TwoFace Loader SHA256**\n\ned684062f43d34834c4a87fdb68f4536568caf16c34a0ea451e6f25cf1532d51\n\nf4da5cb72246434decb8cf676758da410f6ddc20196dfd484f513aa3b6bc4ac5\n\n9a361019f6fbd4a246b96545868dcb7908c611934c41166b9aa93519504ac813\n\nd0ffd613b1b285b15e2d6c038b0bd4951eb40eb802617cf6eb4f56cda4b023e3\n\n**TwoFace++ Loader SHA256**\n\nbca01f14fb3cb4cfbe7f240156feebc55abac73a6c96b9f75da2f9df580101ef\n\n8d178b9730e09e35c071526bfb91ce72f876797ebc4e81f0bc05e7bb8ad1734e\n\n**TwoFace Payload SHA256**\n\n8f0419493da5ba201429503e53c9ccb8f8170ab73141bdc6ae6b9771512ad84b\n\n0a77e28e6d0d7bd057167ca8a63da867397f1619a38d5c713027ebb22b784d4f\n\n54c8bfa0be1d1419bf0770d49e937b284b52df212df19551576f73653a7d061f\n\n818ac924fd8f7bc1b6062a8ef456226a47c4c59d2f9e38eda89fff463253942f\n\nfd47825d75e3da3e43dc84f425178d6e834a900d6b2fd850ee1083dbb1e5b113\n\n79c9a2a2b596f8270b32f30f3e03882b00b87102e65de00a325b64d30051da4e\n\ne33096ab328949af19c290809819034d196445b8ed0406206e7418ec96f66b68\n\nc116f078a0b9ea25c5fdb2e72914c3446c46f22d9f2b37c582600162ed711b69\n\n**IntrudingDivisor Shell SHA256**\n\ne342d6bf07de1257e82f4ea19e9f08c9e11a43d9ad576cd799782f6e968914b8\n\n49f43f2caaea89bd3bb137f4228e543783ef265abbdc84e3743d93a7d30b0a7e\n\n**Mimikatz SHA256**\n\nf17272d146f4d46dda5dc2791836bfa783bdc09ca062f33447e4f3a26f26f4e0\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
