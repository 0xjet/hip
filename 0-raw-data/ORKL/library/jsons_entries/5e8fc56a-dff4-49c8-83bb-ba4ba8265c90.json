We call this_\n_report our “Intelligence Insights” and share a public version of it with the broader infosec_\n_community._\n\n## Highlights\n\n**Editor’s note: We realize much of the cybersecurity community is focused on the Log4j**\nvulnerability right now, and we’re tracking that too. The post-exploitation activity we’ve\nobserved remains fairly low at this time, though that could change. While the Log4j\nvulnerability is undoubtedly important, we want to continue to release intelligence about all\nthe other threats we’ve seen that are still impacting enterprises. Some of the threats in our\ntop 10, such as [Cobalt Strike and](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/cobalt-strike/) [Mimikatz, have been observed in activity following](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/mimikatz/)\nexploitation of the Log4j vulnerability. This underscores the importance of continuing to\ntrack prevalent threats and entire chains of activity while also taking actions to remediate\nsuch a widespread vulnerability.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we ve done for the past few months, we again looked at the 10 most prevalent threats\nencountered in the environments that Red Canary monitors. These prevalence rankings are\nbased on the number of unique customer environments in which we observed each threat.\nHere’s how the numbers shook out for November 2021:\n\nTOP THREATS IN NOVEMBER 2021\n\n**November rank** **Threat name** **Percent of customers affected**\n\n\nNovember rank :\n⬆ 1\n\nNovember rank :\n⬆ 2*\n\nNovember rank :\n⬇ 2*\n\nNovember rank :\n⬆ 4\n\nNovember rank :\n⬆ 5\n\nNovember rank :\n⬇ 6\n\nNovember rank :\n⬆ 7\n\nNovember rank :\n⬆ 8*\n\nNovember rank :\n⬆ 8*\n\nNovember rank :\n⬇ 10*\n\nNovember rank :\n⬆ 10*\n\n\nThreat name:\nImpacket\n\nThreat name:\n[Cobalt Strike](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/cobalt-strike/)\n\nThreat name:\n[Mimikatz](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/mimikatz/)\n\nThreat name:\nSocGholish\n\nThreat name:\n[Qbot](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/qbot/)\n\nThreat name:\n[TA551](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/TA551/)\n\nThreat name:\nAdload\n\nThreat name:\nTR\n\nThreat name:\nSquirrelWaffle\n\nThreat name:\n[Gamarue](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/gamarue/)\n\nThreat name:\nUrsnif\n\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n1.9%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n1.5%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n1.5%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n1.3%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n1.1%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n1.0%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.9%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.8%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.8%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.7%\n\nPercent of customers affected :\n0.7%\n\n\n-----\n\n⬆ = trending up from previous month\n⬇= trending down from previous month\n➡ = no change in rank from previous month\n\n*Denotes a tie\n\n## Observations on trending threats\n\n**Qbot continued to climb the ranks on the back of TR phishing campaigns leveraging**\n**SquirrelWaffle. Both TR and SquirrelWaffle cracked our top 10 for the first time this month.**\nIf you’re wondering why the payload (Qbot) is more prevalent than the initial access (TR),\nthere are a few explanations. One is that there are multiple campaigns leading to Qbot.\nWhile TR is prolific, it is not the only source of the Qbot we see. Another reason that we\nsometimes see more later-stage activity rather than initial access is that it’s an artifact of\nonboarding customers during incident response. In many cases, our visibility into an\nenvironment begins in the middle of the attack chain—when the command and control bots\n(i.e., Qbot) are actively running but the ephemeral initial access has already run its course.\n\n**While it didn’t make our top 10, we saw more detections* for BazarBackdoor than**\n**we’ve previously seen in any single month. Phishing campaigns delivered**\nBazarBackdoor every Tuesday and Wednesday for the first three weeks of November.\nDespite this pattern in the timing, we observed variations in the phishing affiliate delivering\nthe payload. For example, one affiliate that we had historically tied to Bazar recently began\ndelivering Emotet as well. See the section“Guess who’s back…” below for details.\n\n*This increase applies both to the number of customer environments and the number of\nindividual detections.\n\n**Conspicuously absent from this list is Yellow Cockatoo, which previously topped our**\n**charts. After a meteoric rise in late summer and early fall, Yellow Cockatoo was the most**\nprevalent threat we saw in Red Canary customers in September. This prolific pest\nperpetuated its preponderance throughout most of October, then vanished suddenly. This\nobservation is consistent with the timeline of reporting from a researcher, going by the\nhandle “SquiblyDoo,” who closely monitors Yellow Cockatoo activity. Squiblydoo’s research\n[trail appears to have gone cold after posting a blog in mid-October with updates on changes](https://squiblydoo.blog/2021/10/17/solarmarker-by-any-other-name/)\nin Yellow Cockatoo’s TTPs. Red Canary continues to monitor for signs of new activity and\nwill update our coverage if—and when—anything changes.\n\n## Guess who’s back, back again… Emotet’s back, tell a friend…\n\n\n-----\n\nMonths after a [coordinated effort disrupted their infrastructure and operations, Emotet has](https://www.justice.gov/opa/documents-and-resources-related-disruption-emotet-malware-and-botnet)\nreturned and they’re changing things up. For the first time this month, we saw Emotet\ndelivered via AppX bundles, suggesting that certain operators may be experimenting with\nways to evade common defenses.\n\n**In November 2021, Red Canary observed Emotet delivered via AppX, a type of**\n**installer bundle used to distribute common Windows applications. In these**\ncases, victims interacted with a website spoofed to resemble an installer for Adobe\nPDF software, where they downloaded an AppX bundle containing an Emotet file.\n**Emotet activity in November also involved previously known delivery**\n**mechanisms. Much of the other Emotet activity we saw resembled variations on**\nEmotet campaigns of the past. In these cases, documents sent as attachments via\nemail contained PowerShell code written to download Emotet payloads, which used\nthe export Control_RunDLL for execution. Though we did not observe this activity\nfirsthand, in mid November, security researchers observed Trickbot malware\ninfections deploying Emotet payloads.\n**This evolving tradecraft complicates efforts to track and attribute activity. In the**\ncase of the AppX bundles, Emotet appeared to use the same resources that were\nused by BazarBackdoor for deployment earlier in November. Since Red Canary\nobserved the same activity and resources used by both families, we decided to track\nthe AppX bundle deployment activity cluster under a separate name: Ultramarine\nWren.\n\nAs Emotet evolves and we observe its use in different activity clusters, we continue to track\nchanges in behavior and corresponding ways to detect that behavior.\n\n### Detection opportunity: Rundll32 execution with a unique function\n\nprocess_ name == `rundll32.exe`\n\n&&\ncommand_line_contains == `Control_RunDLL`\n\n&&\ncommand_line_ does_ not_ contain == `shell32`\n\n## Recent increase in websell activity likely stems from exploitation of ADSelfService Plus RCE vulnerability\n\nOver November, Red Canary observed an increase in detections involving webshells.\nFurther analysis suggests that many of these were likely the result of the exploitation of\n[CVE -2021-40539, a vulnerability in ADSelfService Plus. ADSelfService Plus is a common](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40539)\npassword management and single sign-on (SSO) solution. Exploitation of this vulnerability\ncan enable a range of nefarious follow-on activity, and multiple operators are reportedly\n\n\n-----\n\nusing this exploit in the wild. We are tracking behaviors related to known compromises and\nrecommend that customers using ADSelfServicePlus apply the patch issued by\nManageEngine.\n\n**[Researchers at Synactiv outlined in-the-wild use of tradecraft involving this](https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/how-to-exploit-cve-2021-40539-on-manageengine-adselfservice-plus.html)**\n**vulnerability that allowed Red Canary to identify a specific behavior consistently**\n**related to this attack chain. We saw operators use the Java utility** `keytool.exe to move`\na recently installed webshell from an initial directory to a new location.\n\n### Detection opportunity: Keytool.exe spawning Windows shell parent process\n\nparent_process_name== keytool.exe\n\n&&\nprocess_name ==( cmd.exe || `powershell.exe )`\n\n**Failure to securely configure ADSelfService Plus can provide an adversary who**\n**exploits this vulnerability with immediate domain admin access. Administrators can**\nconfigure ADSelfService Plus in a variety of ways, giving varied levels of permissions to\nActive Directory users, ranging from local SYSTEM to full Domain Admin. In turn, if an\nadversary were to exploit CVE-2021-40539, they would be given that level of permission\nand access to the Active Directory. To properly secure ADSelfService Plus and protect\nActive Directory accounts, we strongly recommend that customers refrain from running\n[ADSelfService Plus with an elevated permissions account, such as Domain Admin. Instead,](https://download.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/adselfservice-plus-privileges-permissions-requirement-guide.pdf)\ncustomers should use an unprivileged Active Directory account configured according to\n[guidance from ManageEngine.](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/help/admin-guide/domain-settings.html)\n\n[Based on our observations and public reporting from CISA,](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-259a) [Microsoft, and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/08/threat-actor-dev-0322-exploiting-zoho-manageengine-adselfservice-plus/) Palo Alto’s Unit\n42, it is clear that post-exploitation activity varies across intrusions. We continue to track\nactivity related to this threat and expand our detection coverage to account for new\nvariations.\n\n### Detection opportunity: Excel spawning WMIC\n\nparent_process_name == `excel.exe`\n\nprocess_name == `wmic.exe`\n\n### Detection opportunity: MSHTA execution without HTA file\n\nprocess name == `mshta.exe`\n\ncommand_line_does_not_contain == `.hta`\n\n\n-----\n\nAs always, the assessments in this report represent our best thinking based on our current\nvisibility.
