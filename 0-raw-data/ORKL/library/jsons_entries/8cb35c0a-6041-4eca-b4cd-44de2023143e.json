    "plain_text": "# FBI: Ransomware gang breached 52 US critical infrastructure orgs\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-ransomware-gang-breached-52-us-critical-infrastructure-orgs/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-ransomware-gang-breached-52-us-critical-infrastructure-orgs/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nMarch 7, 2022\n03:16 PM\n0\n\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) says the Ragnar Locker ransomware gang has\nbreached the networks of at least 52 organizations from multiple US critical infrastructure\nsectors.\n\nThis was revealed in a joint TLP:WHITE flash alert published on Monday in coordination with\nthe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\n\"As of January 2022, the FBI has identified at least 52 entities across 10 critical infrastructure\nsectors affected by RagnarLocker ransomware, including entities in the critical\nmanufacturing, energy, financial services, government, and information technology sectors,\"\n[the federal law enforcement agency said [PDF].](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21397387-ragnarlocker-ransomware-indicators-of-compromise)\n\n\n-----\n\nRagnarLocker ransomware actors work as part of a ransomware family, frequently changing\nobfuscation techniques to avoid detection and prevention.\"\n\nThe flash alert focuses on providing indicators of compromise (IOCs) organizations can use\nto detect and block Ragnar Locker ransomware attacks.\n\nIOCs associated with Ragnar Locker activity include info on attack infrastructure, Bitcoin\naddresses used to collect ransom demands, and email addresses used by the gang's\noperators.\n\n[Although the FBI first became aware of Ragnar Locker in April 2020, Ragnar Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ragnar-locker/)\nransomware payloads were first observed in attacks months before, during late December\n2019.\n\nRagnar Locker operators terminate remote management software (e.g., ConnectWise,\nKaseya) used by managed service providers (MSPs) to manage clients' systems remotely on\ncompromised enterprise endpoints.\n\nThis allows the threat actors to evade detection and make sure remotely logged-in admins\ndo not interfere with or block the ransomware deployment process.\n\n## Request for info linked to Ragnar Locker attacks\n\nThe FBI asked admins and security professionals who detect Ragnar Locker activity to share\nany related information with their local FBI Cyber Squad.\n\nUseful info that would help identify the threat actors behind this ransomware gang includes\ncopies of the ransom notes, ransom demands, malicious activity timelines, payload samples,\nand more.\n\nThe FBI added that it doesn't encourage paying Ragnar Locker ransoms since victims have\nno guarantee that paying will prevent leaks of stolen data or future attacks.\n\nInstead, ransom payments will further motivate the ransomware gang to target even more\nvictims and incentivizes other cybercrime operations to join in and launch their own\nransomware attacks.\n\nHowever, the federal agency did recognize the damage inflicted to businesses by\nransomware attacks, which may force executives to pay ransoms and protect shareholders,\ncustomers, or employees.\n\nThe FBI also shared mitigation measures to block such attacks and strongly urged victims to\n[report such incidents to their local FBI field office.](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\n\n\n-----\n\nSince December, the FBI also revealed that Cuba ransomware compromised the networks of\nat least 49 US critical infrastructure entities, while the BlackByte ransomware gang hit at\nleast three others.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[FBI: BlackCat ransomware breached at least 60 entities worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-blackcat-ransomware-breached-at-least-60-entities-worldwide/)\n\n[FBI warns of ransomware attacks targeting US agriculture sector](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-warns-of-ransomware-attacks-targeting-us-agriculture-sector/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Cybersecurity agencies reveal top initial access attack vectors](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cybersecurity-agencies-reveal-top-initial-access-attack-vectors/)\n\n[US links Thanos and Jigsaw ransomware to 55-year-old doctor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-links-thanos-and-jigsaw-ransomware-to-55-year-old-doctor/)\n\n\n-----",
