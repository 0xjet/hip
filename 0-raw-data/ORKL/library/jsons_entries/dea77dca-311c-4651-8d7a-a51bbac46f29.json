However, the ransomware is more commonly known as\nCuba, which is how BleepingComputer will reference them throughout this article.\n\nCuba is a ransomware operation that launched at the end of 2019, and while they started\nslow, they began to pick up speed in 2020 and 2021. This increase in activity led to the FBI\nissuing a Cuba ransomware advisory in December 2021, warning that the gang breached\n49 critical infrastructure organizations in the U.S.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a new report by Mandiant, researchers show that the Cuba operation primarily targets the\nUnited States, followed by Canada.\n\n**Cuba ransomware victims heat map**\n\n_Source: Mandiant_\n\n## Mixing commodity and custom malware\n\nThe Cuba ransomware gang was seen leveraging Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to\ndeploy web shells, RATs, and backdoors to establish their foothold on the target network\nsince August 2021.\n\n\"Mandiant has also identified the exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities,\n[including ProxyShell and](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/pst-want-shell-proxyshell-exploiting-microsoft-exchange-servers) [ProxyLogon, as another access point leveraged by UNC2596](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/)\n[likely as early as August 2021,\" explains Mandiant in a new report.](http://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2596-cuba-ransomware)\n\nThe planted backdoors include Cobalt Strike or the NetSupport Manager remote access\ntool, but the group also uses their own ‘Bughatch’, ‘Wedgecut’, and ‘eck.exe”,\nand Burntcigar’ tools.\n\n**Wedgecut comes in the form of an executable named “check.exe,” which is a**\nreconnaissance tool that enumerates the Active Directory through PowerShell.\n\n**Bughatch is a downloader that fetches PowerShell scripts and files from the C&C server.**\nTo evade detection it loads in memory from a remote URL\n\n\n-----\n\n**Burntcigar is a utility that can terminate processes at the kernel level by exploiting a flaw in**\n[an Avast driver, which is included with the tool for a “bring your own vulnerable driver”](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dell-driver-fix-still-allows-windows-kernel-level-attacks/)\nattack.\n\nFinally, there’s a memory-only dropper that fetches the above payloads and loads them,\ncalled Termite. However, this tool has been observed in campaigns of multiple threat\ngroups, so it’s not used exclusively by the Cuba threat actors.\n\nThe threat actors escalate privileges using stolen account credentials sourced through the\nreadily available Mimikatz and Wicker tools.\n\nThen they perform network reconnaissance with Wedgecut, and next, they move laterally\nwith RDP, SMB, PsExec, and Cobalt Strike.\n\nThe subsequent deployment is Bughatch loaded by Termite, followed by Burntcigar, which\nlays the ground for data exfiltration and file encryption by deactivating security tools.\n\nThe Cuba gang doesn’t use any cloud services for the exfiltration step but instead sends\neverything onto their own private infrastructure.\n\n**Cuba ransomware note to victims**\n_Source: Mandiant_\n\n## An evolving operation\n\n[Back in May 2021, Cuba ransomware partnered with the spam operators of the Hancitor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cuba-ransomware-partners-with-hancitor-for-spam-fueled-attacks/)\nmalware to gain access to corporate networks through DocuSign phishing emails.\n\nSince then, Cuba has evolved its operations to target public-facing services vulnerabilities,\n[such as the Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-exchange-servers-are-getting-hacked-via-proxyshell-exploits/) [ProxyLogon vulnerabilities.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-fixes-actively-exploited-exchange-zero-day-bugs-patch-now/)\n\nThis shift makes the attacks more potent but also easier to thwart, as security updates that\nplug the exploited issues have been available for many months now.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cuba operation will likely turn its attention to other vulnerabilities once there are no\nmore valuable targets running unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers.\n\nThis means that applying the available security updates as soon as the software vendors\nrelease them is key in maintaining a robust security stance against even the most\nsophisticated threat actors.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Magniber ransomware gang now exploits Internet Explorer flaws in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/magniber-ransomware-gang-now-exploits-internet-explorer-flaws-in-attacks/)\n\n[Microsoft Exchange servers hacked to deploy Hive ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-servers-hacked-to-deploy-hive-ransomware/)\n\n[Microsoft Exchange targeted for IcedID reply-chain hijacking attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-targeted-for-icedid-reply-chain-hijacking-attacks/)\n\n[Cuba Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cuba-ransomware/)\n[Microsoft Exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft-exchange/)\n[ProxyLogon](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/proxylogon/)\n[ProxyShell](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/proxyshell/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vulnerability/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
