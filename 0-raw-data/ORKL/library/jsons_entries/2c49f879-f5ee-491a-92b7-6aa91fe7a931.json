To determine who was behind\nthe attack many have cited past research that compares code from Ryuk with the older\nransomware Hermes to link the attack to North Korea. Determining attribution was largely\nbased on the fact that the Hermes ransomware has been used in the past by North Korean\nactors, and code blocks in Ryuk are similar to those in Hermes.\n\nThe McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has investigated this incident and determined\nhow the malware works, how the attackers operate, and how to detect it. Based on the\ntechnical indicators, known cybercriminal characteristics, and evidence discovered on the\ndark web, our hypothesis is that the Ryuk attacks may not necessarily be backed by a\nnation-state, but rather share the hallmarks of a cybercrime operation.\n\n**How McAfee approaches attribution**\n\n\n-----\n\nAttribution is a critical part of any cybercrime investigation. However, technical evidence is\noften not enough to positively identify who is behind an attack because it does not provide all\nthe pieces of the puzzle. Artifacts do not all appear at once; a new piece of evidence\nunearthed years after an attack can shine a different light on an investigation and introduce\nnew challenges to current assumptions.\n\n**Ryuk attack: putting the pieces together**\n\n[In October 2017, we investigated an attack on a Taiwanese bank. We discovered the actors](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/taiwan-bank-heist-role-pseudo-ransomware/)\nused a clever tactic to distract the IT staff: a ransomware outbreak timed for the same\nmoment that the thieves were stealing money. We used the term pseudo-ransomware to\ndescribe this attack. The malware was Hermes version 2.1.\n\n[One of the functions we often see in ransomware samples is that they will not execute if the](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/ransomware.html)\nvictim’s system language is one of the following:\n\n419 (Russian)\n422 (Ukrainian)\n423 (Belarusian)\n\nThat was October 2017. Searching earlier events, we noticed a posting from August 2017 in\nan underground forum in which a Russian-speaking actor offered the malware kit Hermes 2.1\nransomware:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat if the actor who attacked the Taiwanese bank simply bought a copy of Hermes and\nadded it to the campaign to cause the distraction? Why go to the trouble to build something,\nwhen the actor can just buy the perfect distraction in an underground forum?\n\nIn the same underground forum thread we found a post from October 22, 2018, mentioning\nRyuk.\n\n\n-----\n\n[This post contains a link to an article in the Russian security magazine Xakep.ru ( Hacker )](https://xakep.ru/2018/08/22/ryuk/)\ndiscussing the emergence of Ryuk and how it was first discovered by MalwareHunterTeam in\nAugust 2018. This first appearance came well before last week’s attack on newspaper\nprinting services.\n\n**Manga connection**\n\nRyuk, according to Wikipedia, refers to a Japanese manga character from the series “Death\nNote.” Ryuk apparently drops a death note, a fitting name for ransomware that drops ransom\nnotes.\n\nRansomware is typically named by its cybercriminal developer, as opposed to the naming of\nstate-sponsored malware, which is mostly is done by the security industry. It seems the\ncriminals behind Ryuk are into manga.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of manga character names and references is common in the cybercriminal scene.\nWe often come across manga-inspired nicknames and avatars in underground forums.\n\n## Technical indicators\n\nLooking at research from our industry peers comparing Ryuk and Hermes, we notice that the\nfunctionalities are generally equal. We agree that the actors behind Ryuk have access to the\nHermes source code.\n\nLet’s dive a bit deeper into Ryuk and compare samples over the last couple of months\nregarding compilation times and the presence of program database (PDB) paths:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can see the PDB paths are almost identical. When we compare samples from August\nand December 2018 and focus on the checksum values of the executables’ rich headers,\nthey are also identical.\n\nFrom a call-flow perspective, we notice the similarities and evolution of the code:\n\n_The Hermes 2.1 ransomware kit, renamed and redistributed as Ryuk._\n\nThe author and seller of Hermes 2.1 emphasizes that he is selling is a kit and not a service.\nThis suggests that a buyer of the kit must do some fine tuning by setting up a distribution\nmethod (spam, exploit kit, or RDP, for example) and infrastructure to make Hermes work\neffectively. If changing a name and ransom note are part of these tuning options, then it is\nlikely that Ryuk is an altered version Hermes 2.1.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution: analyzing competing hypotheses\n\nIn the race to determine who is behind an attack, research facts (the What and How\nquestions) are often put aside to focus on attribution (the Who question). Who did it? This\npursuit is understandable yet fundamentally flawed. Attribution is crucial, but there will\nalways be unanswered questions. Our approach focuses on answering the What and How\nquestions by analyzing the malware, the infrastructure involved, and the incident response\nperformed at the victim’s site.\n\nOur approach is always to analyze competing hypotheses. When investigating an incident,\nwe form several views and compare all the artifacts to support these hypotheses. We try not\nonly to seek verifying evidence but also actively try to find evidence that falsifies a\nhypothesis. Keeping our eyes open for falsifying facts and constantly questioning our results\nare essential steps to avoid conformation bias. By following this method, we find the\nstrongest hypothesis is not the one with the most verifying evidence, but the one with the\nleast falsifying evidence.\n\nExamining competing hypotheses is a scientific approach to investigating cyber incidents. It\nmay not help with the race to attribution, but it ensures the output is based on available\nevidence.\n\nThe most likely hypothesis in the Ryuk case is that of a cybercrime operation developed from\na tool kit offered by a Russian-speaking actor. From the evidence, we see sample similarities\nover the past several months that indicate a tool kit is being used. The actors have targeted\nseveral sectors and have asked a high ransom, 500 Bitcoin. Who is responsible? We do not\nknow. But we do know how the malware works, how the attackers operate, and how to detect\nthe threat. That analysis is essential because it allows us to serve our customers.\n\n[John Fokker](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/john-fokker/)\n\n\n-----\n\nJohn Fokker is a Principal Engineer and Head of Cyber Investigations for the Advanced\nThreat Research.
