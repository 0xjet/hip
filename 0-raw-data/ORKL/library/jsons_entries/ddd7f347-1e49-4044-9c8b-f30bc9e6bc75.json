The tasks set are difficult,\nbut solvable. We hope to add all the functionality as soon as possible, as it will be\nready.\nWe also finished work on a blog in which data from compromised systems will be\npublished. We urged all adverts to copy information as often as possible, so we are\nconvinced that this will be a very effective use of this blog. Not all blog\ninformation is available for viewing - some information is previously available to\nservices for the sale of SS and other information, which will allow you to get a\nfairly high rate of return on this information. Now we can say with confidence - all\nthe companies that have our product have serious problems with data privacy. We\nstrongly recommend that these companies move to negotiations fairly quickly, as we\nplan to expand and improve this blog. Have some interesting thoughts about auto notification email addresses of stock exchanges (for example, NASDAQ ), which will\nallow you to influence the financial condition of the company quickly and\nefficiently.\nNow all data will be published on this blog.\nxxx\nThere are 3 places in the affiliate program. Interested in networking . Soon,\nprobably, we will leave all sites and stop recruiting. Hurry up.\n\n```\nAs part of this post, they also linked to a 10MB stolen data dump of one of their victims that\nthey claim contains financial and tax information. They go on to state that they will add more\nto this data dump if the victim does not pay.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Leaked data of a victim**\nBleepingComputer will not be naming the victim until we confirm the validity of the alleged\nattack.\n\n## Ransomware attacks are data breaches!\n\nThis feels like a daily statement from BleepingComputer, but all ransomware attacks are now\ndata breaches and must be treated as such.\n\nThe files that were stolen by ransomware operators not only contain company data but also\nthe personal information of its employees.\n\nBy not disclosing these attacks and what has been stolen, company's put their employees at\nrisk of identity theft, fraud, and other malicious attacks.\n\nThis could lead to fines by government agencies and lawsuits from employees whose data\nhas been compromised.\n\nBe smart and transparent about ransomware attacks. It is better in the long run.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Karakurt revealed as data extortion arm of Conti cybercrime syndicate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/karakurt-revealed-as-data-extortion-arm-of-conti-cybercrime-syndicate/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
