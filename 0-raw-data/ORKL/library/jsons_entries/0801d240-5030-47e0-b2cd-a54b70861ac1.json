If you are from a country listed, or not listed, and\nhave further info please feel free to shoot me a PM.\n\nhttp://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/torrentlocker-cryptolocker-ransomwareinformation#regions\n\n**The easy decryption method in TorrentLocker has been fixed by the developer.

Upon running and quickly analyzing the exe, I found that it was a new](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptolocker-ransomware-information)**\n[Encrypting Ransomware (Whats new?). This infection claimed to be Cryptolocker, but also](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptolocker-ransomware-information)\nused the Ransom File Format of **[Cryptowall. I would guess the reason behind this was to](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptowall-ransomware-information)**\ngain fear in the victim when infected as those 2 Ransomware's are uncrackable. After\nrunning through my normal checks when first getting a Encryption infection sample, I started\nmy not so normal ones. I made it a unwritten rule to myself that before trying to figure out\nhard encryption schemes the infection may use, to always try the easy ones quickly first.\n[This means testing a encrypted file for MD5,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) **[SHA-1,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1)** **[RC2,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC2)** **[RC4,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4)** **[XOR, Bit Shift and other](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher)**\n[lower encryption schemes first. (I started doing this because of Cryptorbits simple](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptorbit-ransomware-information)\nencryption that I spent far to long on.)\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter going through the list, my jaw about dropped to the floor when I hit XOR. The virus\ncreator of this infection used a simple (and I mean nothing else) XOR algorithm. I found this\nby taking a encrypted file and XOR'ing its bytes with the good files bytes. This produced a file\nwith a 2MB key buffered with zero's at the bottom. The zeros happen because the infection\nonly encrypts the first 2MB of files. When taking the 2MB key and XOR'ing it with a different\nencrypted file, it was successfully decrypted.\n\n**[Xor Key Sample File (2MB)](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/Nathan/XorKey.Stream)**\n\nAfter finding this out, seeing as how it is such a simple mistake, I knew I had to keep it quite\nand just build a public application for victims to use without disclosing how it works, as the\nvirus creator would simply fix the issue. So for the last few weeks I have been spending time\nmaking the decryption application for the victims, but it seems that a few bloggers didn't feel\nthe same way (Again, Whats new?)\n\n2 days ago **[Digital-forensics Blog decided that after also finding out this information, to post](http://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2014/09/09/torrentlocker-unlocked)**\nit publicly that there was a \"mistake on the malware author's part\", and continued to describe\nin detail what those mistakes were, and also gave the virus creator some pointers! One thing\nthey did not do though is post a way for any victims to decrypt their files after now alerting\nthe virus creator that he made a mistake.\n\nSince then the story has circled around and has been posted on multiple blogs, making\nalmost certain that if the virus creator didn't know, he does by now.\n\n**TorrentLocker Details**\n\nTo go into a little more detail about this infection, When ran it Inject itself into a new instance\nof Explorer, Query all Logical Drives, and loop through each drive encrypting each file it finds\nthat has the below extension and adding .Encrypted to the end.\n\n**TorrentLocker Effected Extensions:**\n```\n*.wb2,*.psd,*.p7c,*.p7b,*.p12,*.pfx,*.pem,*.crt,*.cer,*.der,*.pl,*.py,*.lua,*.css,*.js\njournal,*.db,*.cls,*.bdb,*.al,*.adb,*.backupdb,*.bik,*.backup,*.bak,*.bkp,*.moneywell,\n\n```\nThe viruses Import table consists of: NTDLL.DLL, SHLWAPI.DLL, WININET.DLL,\nCRYPT32.DLL, MAPI32.DLL, KERNEL32.DLL, USER32.DLL, ADVAPI32.DLL,\nSHELL32.DLL, OLE32.DLL, and OLEAUT32.DLL. The virus actually uses an open source\n[Lib to assist in the encryption which is named LibTom. Alot of these bloggers seem to think](http://libtom.org/?page=features)\nthat the virus creator used AES or another advance encryption to generate the XOR key, and\nsimply forgot/ignored to used the key with a advanced encryption before using XOR. Yet, the\ncode proves otherwise. The author simply uses a 32 byte seed to generate the 2MB key\nstream and its used to XOR the file Simple as that\n\n\n-----\n\n**Example of 32 Byte Seed**\n\n**File List:**\n\n**C:\\Windows\\<Random>.exe - Duplicate infection EXE**\n\n***\\DECRYPT_INSTRUCTIONS.HTML - Ransomnote (Dropped in any encrypted folder)**\n\n**%ProgramData%\\<Random>\\<Random> - Temp file for the infection (No Extension)**\n\n**Registry List:**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\<Random>\\01000000 - Hex of infection**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\<Random>\\02000000 - Path to infection exe**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\<Random>\\03000000 - UID for infection**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\<Random>\\04000000 - HTML Document in hex**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\<Random>\\05000000 -** **Number of infected files**\n\n**C&C List:**\n\n**[Https://server38.info/gate.php](https://server38.info/gate.php)**\n\n**Note: It is also important to mention that this infection will not infect a computer without**\ncontacting its C&C server.\n\n**TorrentLocker Decrypter**\n\n\n-----\n\nTo download TorrentUnlocker, Please use the following link:\n\n**[TorrentLocker De-Ransomware V1.0.5.0](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/Nathan/TorrentUnlocker.exe)**\n\nOnce the file has been downloaded, run the TorrentUnlocker.exe program. This will open\nthe main window seen above, then simply follow the instructions.\n\n[If you need any help with TorrentUnlocker please message me, Nathan (DecrypterFixer)](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/u/834086/decrypterfixer/)\n\nThis is V 1.0.5.0 of TorrentUnlocker De-Ransomware. This software will help you decrypt\nfiles that were effected by TorrentLocker. There is a catch though! In order to use this\nDecrypter, you must have a Original version of a encrypted file that is at least 2MB. Lets say\nI have a image on my DropBox that is untouched by the infection named \"Family.jpg\" that is\nover 2MB, and that I had a copy of it on my local computer when the infection hit. To use this\napp, all I would need is that \"Family.jpg\" and the \"Family.jpg.encrypted\" on my local\ncomputer.\n\nThis application requires .NET 4.0, but has it packaged inside. So if you do not have .Net\n4.0, it will install it for you. Even more important is, this application relies on you to give it the\ncorrect files to make the TorrentLocker key. That means if you mess up, it messes up. So it is\nALWAYS recommended to run this application on a folder with copies of your encrypted files\nfirst! Once everything is confirmed to be okay, then you may select your whole drive.\n\n_* This application also has step by step guide arrows to help you glide through decrypting_\n_your files with ease. If you ever find yourself confused on what the next step is, Simply look_\n_for the blinking arrow to continue._\n\n\n-----\n\n**A newer version will be coming soon with the following features to help victims more:**\n\n**Resize ability**\n**Support for files over 4GB**\n**Auto Correct Key detection**\n\nThanks for reading!\n**Edited by Grinler, 10 December 2014 - 06:02 PM.**\n\nBack to top\n[Community Forum Software by IP.Board](http://www.invisionpower.com/apps/board/)\n\n\n-----",
