Additionally, we will also send you all details about the\nzero-day vulnerability to security@qnap.com.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**Message from threat actors for QNAP**\n\n_Source:_ _[Twitter](https://twitter.com/news_wireless/status/1486045652652105733)_\nThe ransomware gang further states that there is no way to contact them other than through\nBitcoin payments.\n\nThis method of communication is a very different approach than other ransomware attacks\nthat usually provide some form of communication, whether through a dedicated Tor website,\nemail, or messaging platforms.\n\n## QNAP force updates to\n\n[On January 26th, QNAP began force-updating customers' NAS devices to firmware version](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-force-installs-update-after-deadbolt-ransomware-hits-3-600-devices/)\n5.0.0.1891, which is the latest universal firmware released on December 23rd, 2021.\n\nQNAP told BleepingComputer that they forced-installed this update as they believe the\n[threat actors are using a remote code execution vulnerability fixed in the](https://www.qnap.com/en/security-advisory/qsa-21-57) 5.0.0.1891\nfirmware version.\n\nHowever, a customer posted to the QNAP forum stating that they were encrypted even\nwhen they had this firmware version installed, indicating that the threat actors are\nlikely exploiting a different vulnerability.\n\n\n-----\n\nConfirmed getting hit with deadbolt while using 5.0.0.1891 build 20211221 on a tvs[1282t3,\" the NAS owner posted to the QNAP forums.](https://forum.qnap.com/viewtopic.php?p=808956#p808956)\n\nAfter asking for a comment on this, QNAP conceded that it could be another vulnerability\nexploited by the threat actors.\n\n\"All the information we have shows DEADBOLT could be prevented with the build.\nTheoretically, we cannot exclude the possibility that there is the other vulnerability exploited.\nWe are also interested in the user's observation,\" QNAP told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"If possible, we would suggest users with similar situation could submit a ticket to Technical\nSupport.\"\n\nQNAP also told BleepingComputer that the update should only have been installed by those\nwith the 'Recommended version' setting enabled in the Auto Updates settings, as shown\nbelow.\n\n**QNAP auto update settings**\nQNAP asks customers to contact technical support if they are still receiving updates with\nthat setting unchecked.\n\n## DeadBolt technical details\n\nWhen a QNAP NAS device is compromised, the threat actors will install the DeadBolt\nmalware executable as a randomly named file in the /mnt/HDA_ROOT/ folder. For\nexample, the DeadBolt ransomware executable could be located at\n/mnt/HDA_ROOT/27855.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware expert Michael Gillespie told BleepingComputer that ransomware is initially\nlaunched with a config file, which likely contains various data, including an encryption key\nused to encrypt files.\n\nThe initial command to encrypt files is:\n```\n[random_file_name] -e [config] /share\n\n```\nThe /share folder is where QNAP NAS devices store user folders and files.\n\nWhen encrypting files, the ransomware will only target files with the following file\nextensions:\n```\n.3dm, .3ds, .3fr, .3g2, .3gp, .3pr, .ab4, .accdb, .accdc, .accde, .accdr, .accdt,\n.ach, .acr, .act, .adb, .ads, .agdl, .ait, .apj, .arw, .asf, .asm, .asp, .aspx,\n.asx, .avhd, .avi, .awg, .back, .backup, .backupdb, .bak, .bank, .bay, .bdb, .bgt,\n.bik, .bin, .bkf, .bkp, .blend, .bpw, .cdf, .cdr, .cdr3, .cdr4, .cdr5, .cdr6, .cdrw,\n.cdx, .ce1, .ce2, .cer, .cfg, .cfp, .cgm, .cib, .class, .cls, .cmt, .conf, .cpi,\n.cpp, .cr2, .craw, .crl, .crt, .crw, .csh, .csl, .csr, .csv, .dac, .dat, .db3, .db4,\n.db_journal, .dbc, .dbf, .dbx, .dc2, .dcr, .dcs, .ddd, .ddoc, .ddrw, .dds, .der,\n.des, .design, .dev, .dgc, .disk, .djvu, .dng, .doc, .docm, .docx, .dot, .dotx,\n.drf, .drw, .dtd, .dwg, .dxb, .dxf, .dxg, .edb, .eml, .eps, .erbsql, .erf, .exf,\n.fdb, .ffd, .fff, .fhd, .fla, .flac, .flv, .fpx, .fxg, .gdb, .git, .gray, .grey,\n.gry, .hbk, .hdd, .hpp, .ibank, .ibd, .ibz, .idx, .iif, .iiq, .incpas, .indd, .iso,\n.jar, .java, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .jrs, .kc2, .kdbx, .kdc, .key, .kpdx, .lua, .m4v,\n.mail, .max, .mdb, .mdbx, .mdc, .mdf, .mef, .mfw, .mkv, .mmw, .moneywell, .mos,\n.mov, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .mrw, .msi, .myd, .ndd, .nef, .nk2, .nop, .nrg, .nrw, .ns2,\n.ns3, .ns4, .nsd, .nsf, .nsg, .nsh, .nsn, .nwb, .nx2, .nxl, .nyf, .obj, .oda, .odb,\n.odc, .odf, .odg, .odm, .odp, .ods, .odt, .oil, .orf, .ost, .otg, .oth, .otp, .ots,\n.ott, .ova, .ovf, .p12, .p7b, .p7c, .p7r, .pages, .pas, .pat, .pcd, .pct, .pdb,\n.pdd, .pdf, .pef, .pem, .pfx, .php, .pio, .piz, .plc, .pmf, .png, .pot, .potm,\n.potx, .ppam, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx, .ppt, .pptm, .pptx, .prf, .ps1, .psafe3, .psd,\n.pspimage, .pst, .ptx, .pvi, .pvk, .pyc, .qba, .qbb, .qbm, .qbr, .qbw, .qbx, .qby,\n.r3d, .raf, .rar, .rat, .raw, .rdb, .rtf, .rw2, .rwl, .rwz, .s3db, .sas7bdat, .say,\n.sd0, .sda, .sdb, .sdf, .sl3, .sldm, .sldx, .spc, .sql, .sqlite, .sqlite3,\n.sqlitedb, .sr2, .srf, .srt, .srw, .st4, .st5, .st6, .st7, .st8, .stc, .std, .sti,\n.stw, .stx, .svg, .swf, .sxc, .sxd, .sxg, .sxi, .sxm, .sxw, .tar, .tex, .tga, .thm,\n.tiff, .tlg, .txt, .vbk, .vbm, .vbox, .vcb, .vdi, .vfd, .vhd, .vhdx, .vmc, .vmdk,\n.vmem, .vmfx, .vmsd, .vmx, .vmxf, .vob, .vsd, .vsdx, .vsv, .wallet, .wav, .wb2,\n.wdb, .wmv, .wpd, .wps, .x11, .x3f, .xis, .xla, .xlam, .xlk, .xlm, .xlr, .xls,\n.xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xlt, .xltm, .xltx, .xlw, .xvd, .ycbcra, .yuv, .zip\n\n```\nGillespie says the files are encrypted with AES128 encryption and will have the .deadbolt\nextension appended to file names. For example, test.jpg will be encrypted and renamed to\n**test.jpg.deadbolt.**\n\nDeadBolt will also replace the /home/httpd/index.html file so that when victims access the\ndevice, they will see the ransom screen demanding a ransom of 0.03 bitcoins to a specified\nbitcoin address.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf a ransom is paid, the threat actors will create a bitcoin transaction to the same\nbitcoin ransom address that contains the decryption key for the victim. The decryption key is\nlocated under the OP_RETURN output, as shown below.\n\n**Bitcoin transaction's OP_RETURN output containing decryption key**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nWhen you enter this key into the ransom note screen, the web page will convert it into a\nSHA256 hash and compare it to the SHA256 hash of the victim's decryption key and the\nSHA256 hash of the master decryption key.\n\nThe SHA256 hash for the master decryption key\nis 93f21756aeeb5a9547cc62dea8d58581b0da4f23286f14d10559e6f89b078052.\n\nIf the decryption key matches either SHA256 hash, it will decrypt the files using the\nfollowing command:\n```\n/mnt/HDA_ROOT/[encryptor_name] -d \"[decryption_key]\" /share\n\n```\nMultiple victims have reported paying the ransom and receiving a decryption key that has\nsuccessfully decrypted their files.\n\nHowever, QNAP's forced firmware updates are causing the executable and index.html\nransom screen to be deleted from the device, which prevents the decryption of files.\n\n[Gillespie has created a free Windows decryptor that can be downloaded from Emsisoft and](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/deadbolt)\ndecrypt files without needing the ransomware executable. However, users will still need a\nvalid decryption key, which QNAP owners can only obtain at this time by paying a ransom.\n\n_Update: Added further information on how the decryption key will be retrieved._\n\n_Update 1/26/22: Added further information from QNAP_\n\n_Update 1/28/22: Added technical details, information on exploited vulnerabilities, and_\n_number of victims._\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[QNAP alerts NAS customers of new DeadBolt ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-alerts-nas-customers-of-new-deadbolt-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[QNAP warns of ransomware targeting Internet-exposed NAS devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-warns-of-ransomware-targeting-internet-exposed-nas-devices/)\n\n[QNAP urges customers to disable UPnP port forwarding on routers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-urges-customers-to-disable-upnp-port-forwarding-on-routers/)\n\n[QNAP warns severe OpenSSL bug affects most of its NAS devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-warns-severe-openssl-bug-affects-most-of-its-nas-devices/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[DeadBolt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/deadbolt/)\n[NAS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nas/)\n[QNAP](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/qnap/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
