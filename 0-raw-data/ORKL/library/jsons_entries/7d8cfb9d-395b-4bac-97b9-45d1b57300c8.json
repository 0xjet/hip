It was primarily used to send\nspam messages. Kraken features a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) which appeared in July 2007 and was first\nmentioned in 2008. This makes it [one of the first ever widely used DGA.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/https://www.botconf.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/OK-P06-Plohmann-DGArchive.pdf)\n\nThe original DGA of Kraken is time-independent, i.e., a specific sample will at all times generate the same domains.\nThere are various reports on how to determine the domains. Michael Ligh and Greg Sinclair showed how to use\ninstrumented execution with Immunity debugger in their DEFCON 16 talk “Malware RCE: Debuggers and Decryptor\n_[Development” (skip to 18:24). The same method is also described in The Malware Analyst’s Cookbook, recipe 12-11](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/http://www.amazon.com/Malware-Analysts-Cookbook-DVD-Techniques/dp/0470613033/)_\n[on page 476. This report by Damballa lists the domains for one parameterization of the DGA.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/https://www.damballa.com/downloads/r_pubs/KrakenWhitepaper.pdf)\n\nMuch later — the first samples on Malwr are from 2003 — Kraken’s DGA changed. Probably recognizing the problem\nwith generating the ever same domains, the authors added a time dependent input to the DGA. They also deviated\nfrom dynamic DNS providers and used four regular top level domains instead. A few samples, maybe from the\ntransitional stage, still rely on the DDNS providers even with the new algorithm. Kraken infections with newer DGAs\n[peaked in July 2014 (also see the list of samples in Section Samples).](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Oderoor/detail)\n\nThe later version of Kraken’s DGA is much less reported on. [Here is a analysis of the malware with the new domains.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/bkdr_oderoor.ogj)\nBut neither the domains nor the domain generating algorithm are shown. For me, good enough grounds to look at\nboth DGA in this short blog post. I’m aware that the DGA is irrelevant today, as Kraken is currently dead or inactive,\nbut hopefully the post might still be interesting for the keen DGA historian.\n\n## Reverse Engineering\n\nThis section shows some reverse engineering insights of the DGA. Skip to Python Implementations to see\nreimplementations of the two algorithms.\n\nBoth the old and new version of the DGA have parameters that can change from sample to sample and cause\ndisjoint sets of domains. I therefore looked at multiple samples to identify the variable parts of the DGA. For the old\nDGA I reversed two samples:\n\nsource [virusshare](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/https://virusshare.com/download.4n6?sample=5f004bd36715225c22ddb27d109a2b5f1c5215a6ce2df2e111c5fb49bc7161f9)\n\nuploaded 2012-09-04 03:44\n\nSHA-256 5f004bd36715225c22ddb27d109a2b5f1c5215a6ce2df2e111c5fb49bc7161f9\n\n\n-----\n\nMD5 10fd78f9681d66d2dd39816b5f7f6ea6\n\nsource [malwr](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/https://malwr.com/analysis/YWNjMjc3MDMxMTI0NGY5OWI1MzMzNDk1OGJkOGU3ZWY/)\n\nuploaded 2014-12-08 15:04\n\nSHA-256 4606a621922b28be1ff7f4621713aaafd988b8c5f1153720200c5e6dad0c5416\n\nMD5 60838eeb3f8cd311de0faef80909632d\n\nAs far as the new version goes, I looked at these samples:\n\nsource [malwr](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/https://malwr.com/analysis/OTc5MDI4M2JiYzYxNGFjNWI0N2ZmN2Q0NjUwNWEyMTI/)\n\nuploaded 2013-08-05 04:16\n\nSHA-256 0fed48972c9b5c7fc6735db2b8764c45c95d45bde3764933b4a4909656c1ed47\n\nMD5 f2ae73d866bb4edd14ee96cf74fbb423\n\nsource [virusshare](https://web.archive.org/web/20160324035554/https://virusshare.com/download.4n6?sample=e83bc2ec7975885424668171c2e106f7982bd409e01ce6281fb0e6e722e98810)\n\nuploaded 2012-04-12\n\nSHA-256 e83bc2ec7975885424668171c2e106f7982bd409e01ce6281fb0e6e722e98810\n\nMD5 04966960f3f5ed32ae479079a1bcf6e9\n\nAll listed offsets are from the first sample respectively.\n\n## Pseudo Random Number Generator\n\nBoth Kraken’s DGA use a linear congruential generator (LCG) as pseudo random number generator (PRNG). The\nparameters are the same found in many `rand() implementations:`\n\nThe bits 23 to 8 are used, i.e., r/256 mod 32768.\n\n## Seeding\n\nThe DGA of both versions first initializes the pseudo random number generator (PRNG). Two values are used to\ndetermine the seed of the PRNG:\n\n1. A running counter that starts at 0 and increases in steps of one (version 1) and one or two (version 2). In\n\nversion 2 the increment depends on the outcome of the DNS response for the domain. The details of the\ncounter are discussed in Section Domain Counter.\n2. Whether or not a list of hardcoded IPs could be contacted. These network connections are performed by\n```\n   hardcoded_success at offsets 001BE832 and 0x408D6C respectively in the following images. The routine\n\n```\nreturns `True if the attempts were successful.`\n\nThe following graph views are from the beginning of both DGAs. Both snippets initialize the random number — `ecx`\nin version 1 and `ebx in version 2 — depending on the counter value and success of contact to hardcoded IPs. On`\nleft-hand side is the old version of the DGA, on the right-hand side the newer release (click to enlarge the images).\n\n**version 1** **version 2**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe hardcoded values -265273224 and 143803713 on the left, as well as -1FCFBF87h and 7924542h on the right\nmight change from sample to sample. These parameters can be used to generate different sets of domains.\n\nFor the first version of the DGA, the snippet above boils down to the following, rather elaborate, formula:\n\nI found two different parameter sets. Notice that the changes are very subtle, only the first and last nibble vary:\n\n**version 1** **cs** **cf**\n\nSeed a -0x0FCFBF88 0x8924541\n\nSeed b -0x1FCFBF87 0x7924542\n\nThe second version uses a much simpler formula to initialize the random number:\n\nAgain I found two parameter sets:\n\n\n**version 2** **cs** **cf**\n\nSeed a 24938314 24938315\n\nSeed b 1600000 1600001\n\nNotice that in both versions the counter input to the DGA is first divided by two. The Malware Analyst’s Cookbook\n(page 480) considers this as a flaw of the DGA:\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are two weaknesses in Kraken s DGA that are worth mentioning: (…) Odd numbers cause Kraken s\nalgorithm to generate the same domain names as the even numbers that precede them. This effectively cuts\nthe number of possible domains generated by the DGA in half.\n\nSection Domain Counter explains why I think this is by design and not a flaw of the DGA.\n\n## Discarding (only version 2)\n\nNext follows code that is only present in the new version of Kraken’s DGA. The code incorporates a timestamp,\nwhich is determined by making an HTTP request to a randomly picked, legitimate website. The date is extracted from\nthe http date header of the response and converted to unix timestamp format. For the analysed samples, the\ndomains used to determine the time are: yahoo.com, google.com, live.com, msn.com, aol.com, amazon.com,\n_go.com, bbc.co.uk, cnn.com, news.com, download.com, weather.com, comcast.net, mozilla.com and hp.com. The_\ntimestamp sets the variable discards:\n\n**version 1** **version 2**\n\n_not present_\n\nThe divisor is the number of seconds in a week, so only every 7 days the value discard changes.\n\nThe discard value, along with the current domain number, determines how many of the PRNG cycles are discarded:\n\n**version 1** **version 2**\n\n\n-----\n\n_not present_\n\nIn Pseudocode this is:\n```\ndiscards = timestamp / 604800 + 2\nIF domain_nr % 9 < 8\n  IF domain_nr % 9 >= 6\n    discards -= 1\n  REPEAT discards TIMES\n    r = rand(r)/256 % 32768\n\n```\nNotice that for every ninth domain discarding is skipped. Since the discards are the only time-dependent part of the\nDGA, those domains are invariants and prime targets for sinkholing.\n\n## Length of Random Domain\n\nAfter the PRNG is initialized, the length of the random part of the domain is randomly picked. The two versions use\nalmost the same algorithm:\n\n**version 1** **version 2**\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth versions first generate three random numbers (r is the random number after initialization and, for the secondi\nversion, discarding):\n\nThe first version uses the three random values to set the length as follows:\n\nThe second version works almost the same, apart from (a) the third random number being added rather than\nsubtracted and (b) the minimum length bein 7 instead of 6:\n\nThis gives lengths between 6 and 11 characters for the first version, and 7 and 12 characters for the second version.\n\n## Building the Random Domain\n\nKraken uses straightforward calls to the random number generator to determine the characters of the random\ndomain. All characters a-z are about equally likely picked. Both version use the exact same algorithm:\n\n**version 1** **version 2**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Pseudocode this is:\n```\ndomain = \"\"\nREPEAT domain_length TIMES\n  r = rand(r)\n  domain += (r/256 % 32768) % 26 + 'a'\n\n## Base Domain\n\n```\nThe final step of the domain generation algorithm is to append the base domain. For the first version, these base\ndomains are four dynamic DNS providers. A few of the samples with the second DGA version use the same DDNS\nproviders, for the most part the base domains are regular top level domains though. Domains are picked one after\nanother from a hard-coded list:\n\n**version 1** **version 2**\n\nThe base domains are:\n\n\nversion 1, some version 2\nsamples\n\n\n“dyndns.org” → “yi.org” → “dynserv.com” →\n“mooo.com”\n\n\nFree DDNS\nProviders\n\n\nversion 2 “com” → “net” → “tv” → “cc” Top Level Domains\n\n## Domain Counter\n\nAs seen above, both DGA take a running counter as input. The counter starts at zero. Instead of an upper bound, the\ncounter is reset after 30 minutes of trying to contact the C&C servers. There is some wait time between contacting\ndomains which I did not examine; the expected number of generated domains is therefore unknown to me.\n\n**version 1** **version 2**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe old DGA always increments the index by one, regardless of the call-home attempt for the generated domains.\nFor version 2 things are a little more complicated; the DGA can increment the counter by one or two:\n\n**version 1** **version 2**\n\nThe counter in version 2 is incremented depending on the DNS response to the generated domain. The IP is\ncompared to various hard-coded domains. For example:\n```\n0040AFB9 cmp   eax, 127      ; eax first tuple of IP\n0040AFBC jz   short private_ip        \n0040AFBE\n0040AFBE loc_40AFBE:               \n0040AFBE cmp   eax, 192\n0040AFC3 jnz   short loc_40AFCD\n0040AFC5 cmp   ecx, 168\n0040AFCB jz   short private_ip        \n0040AFCD\n0040AFCD loc_40AFCD:               \n0040AFCD cmp   eax, 172\n0040AFD2 jnz   short loc_40AFDE\n0040AFD4 cmp   ecx, 16      ; ecx second tuple of IP\n0040AFD7 jl   short loc_40AFEB\n0040AFD9 cmp   ecx, 31\n0040AFDC jle   short private_ip        \n...\n\n```\nAll IPs from the following list are treated specially (I do not know why 66.116.125.150 and 72.51.27.51 get special\ntreatments, maybe those were sinkholes in the past).\n\n**range** **comment**\n\n127.x.x.x reserved range\n\n192.168.x.x reserved range\n\n172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 reserved range\n\n0.x.x.x includes failed queries\n\n1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, …, 255.255.255.255 unlikely answers? Sandbox detection?\n\n\n-----\n\n**range** **comment**\n\n66.116.125.150 IP in US\n\n72.51.27.51 IP in Canada\n\nIf the IP matches with one of above the subnets, the counter grows to the next multiple of two, i.e., even counters are\nincreased by two, and odd counters are increased one.\n\nSince inside the DGA routine, odd counters are rounded down to the same number as their previous (even) counters,\nevery domain that returned an IP that was not in a “blacklisted” range will be checked twice. I, for one, don’t think\nthat’s a flaw of the DGA, but a — overly complicated — way to recheck domains.\n\n## Algorithm and Samples\n\n Python Implementations\n\n### Version 1\n\nThe following Python Code generates 1000 domains for a provided seed (either `a or` `b ). The code alternately`\ngenerates domains for when the hardcoded IP callback failed and succeeded.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n p\nfrom ctypes import c_int, c_uint\nimport argparse\ndef rand(r):\n  t = c_int(1103515245 * r + 12435).value\n  return t\ndef crop(r):\n  return (r // 256) % 32768 \ndef dga(index, seed_set, temp_file=True):\n  seeds = {'a': {'ex': -0x0FCFBF88, 'nex': 0x8924541}, \n      'b': {'ex': -0x1FCFBF87, 'nex': 0x7924542}}\n  tlds = [\"dyndns.org\", \"yi.org\", \"dynserv.com\", \"mooo.com\"]\n  domain_nr = int(index/2) + 1000015\n  if temp_file:\n    x = int(c_int(domain_nr*(domain_nr + 7)*(domain_nr+12)).value /9.0) \n    y = domain_nr*(domain_nr+1)\n    r = c_int(x + y + seeds[seed_set]['ex']).value \n  else:\n    x = int(c_int((domain_nr + 2)*(domain_nr + 7)*domain_nr).value/9.0)\n    y = (domain_nr*3 + 1)*domain_nr\n    r = c_int(x + y + seeds[seed_set]['nex']).value\n  rands = 3*[0]\n  for i in range(3):\n    r = rand(r)\n    rands[i] = crop(r)\n  domain_length = (rands[0]*rands[1] -
