The vulnerability no one else knows\nabout, one found by someone with highly specific knowledge of a\nprogram or coding language, opens a backdoor into an adversary’s\nmost sensitive vault. A better understanding of one technology or\ntechnique can give cyber operators an advantage over opponents.\nGovernments benefit from compressing the timelines from\ndiscovery to exploitation, more rapidly using the insights of\nresearchers for operations.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and its current dominant paradigm,\nmachine learning (ML), almost certainly will not fundamentally alter\ncompetition in cyberspace. That said, AI systems will provide both\nnew terrain for cyber operations—as targets that can themselves\nbe hacked—and new tools of cyber operations, as ML aids\noffensive and defensive efforts. China’s military-civil fusion\nstrategy takes a holistic approach to development and aims to\nseamlessly incorporate private resources and developments for\nstate use, with the goal of shortening the pathway for nongovernmental research on AI and cybersecurity to strengthen and\ndiversify government operational capabilities.[1]\n\nThere is notable precedent for using university developments in\nstate-sponsored hacking operations. Over the past decade, China’s\nsecurity services have repeatedly turned to select university faculty\nto conduct research on cyber techniques and, in some cases, run\ncyber operations. Collaboration between university faculty and\ncyber operators illustrates China’s approach to military-civil fusion.\nThis report identifies six universities that previously worked with\nChina’s state-sponsored hacking teams and are now conducting\nresearch on the use of ML for cyber capabilities; two universities\nalso host research programs on cyber attack and cyber defense of\nAI systems. This report summarizes the extent to which these\nuniversities, with ties to known state-sponsored hacking teams,\nmight aid China’s efforts in these areas.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Key Findings_**\n\n - **Multiple universities with connections to Advanced**\n\n**Persistent Threat (APT) cyber actors are conducting**\n**research on the intersection of cybersecurity and ML. All**\nsix universities employ faculty who are actively conducting\nresearch on ML and cybersecurity. At least one known statebacked hacker is researching how to use ML for anomaly\ndetection, a defensive cybersecurity technique. Shanghai\nJiao Tong University’s School of Information Security\nEngineering, a school with ties to the PLA, hosts a research\ninstitute conducting research on offensive and defensive\ncybersecurity techniques; the director of that institute\npublished an analysis of ML and cybersecurity trends in a\nMinistry of State Security periodical. Research on\ncybersecurity and AI is moving from academic journals to\nstrategy forums for China’s security services.\n\n - **Research conducted on the application of machine**\n\n**learning and AI to cybersecurity is extensive, particularly**\n**in the areas of anomaly detection systems, malware**\n**classification, behavior analysis, and active defense. Most**\npapers published by faculty from these universities\nexamined how to use machine learning for defensive\npurposes. Offensively oriented papers noted ML’s\napplication to vulnerability discovery and exploitation—a\ndual-use technique that can secure or wreck software. One\npaper published by an author at Xidian University and\nfunded by the Key State Laboratory for Information\nSecurity’s Unclassified Projects Fund concluded that ML\ncould bolster cyber defenses and improve vulnerability\ndiscovery.\n\n - **Research on the attack and defense of AI systems was**\n\n**less pervasive than research on applying the technology to**\n**cybersecurity. Two schools favored for recruiting cyber**\noperators for specific hacking groups are researching the\nvulnerability of AI systems. Zhejiang University offers\nclasses on the attack and defense of AI systems, alongside\nclasses on how to write intelligence reports.[2] Harbin\n\n\n-----\n\nInstitute of Technology is conducting research on the topic,\nbut does not publish its progress.\n\nGovernments’ use of new technologies affects their relative power\nand influence in the modern world. Nations that innovate faster\nand more effectively often build and sustain an advantage over\ntheir rivals. In such a competition, ML has the potential to be a\ngame-changing technology, and both China and the United States\nare racing to exploit its power. More narrowly, the application of\nML techniques to traditional cyber operations may prove to be\ntransformative, altering operations’ practice and amplifying their\npotency. Since these operations are a fundamental part of modern\nstatecraft, having an operational advantage, even if only for a\nmoment, can yield lasting gains for governments. By examining the\nresearch at select universities, analysts and decisionmakers can\nbetter determine how China may try to apply AI and machine\nlearning techniques to cyber operations in search of this\nadvantage. If the cross-pollination from academic research teams\nto fielded operations occurs for ML-enabled cyber capabilities as it\ndid in earlier cyber operations, then understanding the depth and\nbreadth of the schools’ work can shed light on future operational\ndevelopments and their potential security impacts.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Table of Contents\n\nExecutive Summary ......................................................................................... 1\n\nKey Findings ...................................................................................................................... 2\nIntroduction ........................................................................................................ 5\nFindings ............................................................................................................... 8\nHainan University (海南大学) ........................................................................ 9\n\nConnections to the Security Services ........................................................................ 9\nResearch on AI/ML + Cybersecurity ........................................................................... 9\n\nSoutheast University (东南大学) .................................................................. 9\n\nConnections to the Security Services ........................................................................ 9\nResearch on AI/ML + Cybersecurity ........................................................................ 11\n\nShanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学) .................................... 12\n\nConnections to the Security Services ..................................................................... 12\nResearch on AI/ML + Cybersecurity ........................................................................ 14\n\nXidian University (西安电子科技大学) ..................................................... 16\n\nConnections to the Security Services ..................................................................... 16\nResearch on AI/ML + Cybersecurity ........................................................................ 17\n\nZhejiang University (浙江大学) .................................................................. 19\n\nConnections to the Security Services ..................................................................... 19\nResearch on AI/ML + Cybersecurity ........................................................................ 20\n\nHarbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学) ............................... 23\n\nConnections to Security Services ............................................................................. 23\nResearch on AI/ML + Cybersecurity ........................................................................ 23\nConclusions ..................................................................................................... 25\nAuthor ............................................................................................................... 26\nAcknowledgments ........................................................................................ 26\nEndnotes .......................................................................................................... 27\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\nProfessor Gu Jian (顾剑) splashed cash on whoever could help him.\nStandard password cracking techniques and dictionary attacks\nserved no use for the professor—he needed innovators. Only the\ntop talent would do and he did what he could to lure it out. “Believe\nit or not, our professor has a lot of money,” one student said of\nProfessor Gu.[3] With payouts up to RMB 500K ($73,000), the\nprofessor threw large sums of money at his problems.[4] “Our\nteacher says if no one can crack it this time, then he’ll increase the\nmoney on offer,” the student said.[5] Outside of his classroom,\nProfessor Gu scouted talent at hacking competitions on Hainan\nUniversity’s campus and encouraged students to attend by offering\ncash prizes from one of his shell companies. That company, Hainan\nXiandun Technology Company, even listed its address of\nincorporation as the university’s library.[6]\n\nAs a former PLA officer in the Guangzhou Military Region’s\nPolitical Department, Professor Gu was a natural choice for\nHainan’s State Security Bureau when it sought to stand up its\nhacking operations. Gu Jian served as a professor in the\nInformation Security Department of Hainan University and used his\nposition to run state-sponsored hacking operations. Beginning in\n2013, Professor Gu posted job listings on internal university\nboards, hosted hacking competitions where he scouted for talent,\nand offered bounties on technical capabilities to his students and\ncoworkers. By the time Intrusion Truth—a cybersecurity blog\nrumored to be a front for a national intelligence agency—outed\nProfessor Gu and his government contact in early 2020, his\nhacking team had already victimized companies in the U.S. defense\nindustrial base.[7] Cybersecurity professionals assigned Professor\nGu’s state-sponsored team a standardized designation, Advanced\nPersistent Threat 40 (APT40); it was a sign that the hackers were\nnotable operators.\n\nProfessor Gu’s experience running a state-sponsored APT is not an\naberration. Both the Ministry of State Security (MSS) and the\nPeople’s Liberation Army (PLA) have used universities and their\nemployees to support and conduct cyber operations for many\nyears.[8] Six schools deserve particular scrutiny.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe universities analyzed in this report were chosen because of\ntheir connections to known hacking groups. Universities qualified\nfor inclusion if they: 1) previously conducted cyber operations\n(Hainan University, Southeast University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong\nUniversity), 2) partnered with specific divisions of the security\nservices that conduct cyber operations (Xidian University), or 3)\nwere noted by US cyber threat intelligence companies as places of\nrecruitment for APTs (Zhejiang University and Harbin Institute of\nTechnology). Other universities, aside from these six, also\ncontribute to China’s cyber capabilities albeit without apparent\nconnection to specific APTs, thus falling below the threshold for\nanalysis of this report.[9]\n\nChina’s Science of Military Strategy, a government publication of\nmilitary doctrine and strategic thinking put forward by the PLA’s\nAcademy of Military Science, has long emphasized the integration\nof civilians into the military’s information warfare operations, the\ndomain that includes cyber operations.[10] The CCP’s strategy of\nmilitary-civil fusion aims to leverage private resources for\ngovernment use. Recent reporting shows that the MSS tasks some\ncompanies to analyze bulk data collected from cyber espionage\noperations—exemplifying one way MCF is put into practice in the\ncyber domain.[11] Whereas other countries’ security services may\ncontract with consenting and interested companies, nongovernment entities in China accept working with the CCP as a\ncost of doing business; rejecting the Party’s requests may be the\ndeath-knell for an organization. As China’s security services\ncompete for access to information, cyber operators can leverage\nclose relationships with universities to develop new tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures. This quest for new capabilities pushes\nacademics and operators into new areas of research. The\nintegration of universities and state-sponsored espionage shortens\nthe time required to turn academic research into operational\ncapabilities and creates a window into operators’ possible research\npriorities. Understanding current research can provide insights, and\npotentially indicators, into possible future capabilities and\nintentions. Research applying machine learning to offensive\ntechniques and defensive tactics offers China’s security services\nnew tools to leverage; research on the attack and defense of AI\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems opens a new battlespace for contest. Competition begets\ninnovation.\n\nIt is not this research, in and of itself, that warrants attention.\nResearch on machine learning and AI for cybersecurity, and the\nattack and defense of those same systems are normal topics for\ncomputer science researchers for good reason: machine learning\noffers new tools for cybersecurity professionals to deploy. MLbased cyber threat detection, malware classification, and\ninspection of encrypted data flows all promise future gains for\ncybersecurity. By the same token, AI systems themselves must be\nsecured from attackers. Vulnerable systems proliferate as\ncompanies monetize algorithms and governments deploy new\ntools. Defending these systems requires anticipating how they may\nbe attacked, so researching attack methodologies is one way to\ngain insight into adversaries’ efforts, which in turn could inform\nefforts to bolster defenses. This dual-use nature of cybersecurity\nresearch tints the lens of analysis.\n\nThis paper examines the relationship between China’s statebacked hacking teams, six universities, and the AI/ML research they\ndo that may affect future cyber operations. To do that, this paper\ndraws on open sources[12] to study the relationship between the\nMSS, the PLA’s Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), which is\nresponsible for computer network operations and technical\nreconnaissance, and these institutions.[13] The author examined\nuniversity webpages for each school’s cybersecurity (网络空间安全)\nprogram and information security (信息安全) program. Faculty web\npages with biographical information claiming connection to the\nsecurity services, and research related to AI/ML are analyzed\nbelow. University or government documents from public file\nsharing sites, such as Baidu Wenku, bearing related search terms\nare also included. Findings regarding academic papers from the\nChina National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database reflect\npapers published by each school’s respective degree programs that\nthe CSET data team has determined to be related to AI/ML.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Findings \n\nThis table provides a brief overview of all six universities affiliated\nwith Chinese state-backed APTs; whether the cybersecurity\nprogram at these schools offers courses on AI and machine\nlearning; whether professors at the school are conducting research\non AI and cybersecurity; and if the institution is on the U.S.\nCommerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity\nList. The following subsections provide more details on the links\nbetween each university and the security services, as well as any\nrelevant research conducted by faculty and staff of the institution.\n\n|Institution’s Name in English|Institution’s Name in Mandarin|Affiliated APTs|Cybersecurity Courses Include AI/ML?|Individual Professors Researching AI/ML and Cybersecurity?|US Government BIS Entity List14|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Hainan University|海南大学|APT40|Unknown|Yes|No|\n|Southeast University|东南大学|Deep Panda|Yes|Yes|No|\n|Shanghai Jiao Tong University|上海交通大学|APT1|Yes|Yes|No|\n|Xidian University|西安电子科技 大学|APT3|Yes|Yes|No|\n|Zhejiang University|浙江大学|APT1|Yes|Yes|No|\n|Harbin Institute of Technology|哈尔滨工业大 学|APT1|Unknown|Yes|Yes|\n\n\n-----\n\n### Hainan University (海南大学)\n\n**_Connections to the Security Services_**\n\nHainan University employed a professor conducting cyber\noperations with APT40, which Intrusion Truth attributed to the\nHainan Bureau of the MSS (see introduction).[15]\n\n**_Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity_**\n\nWebsites for the Hainan University cybersecurity school and\nrelated research institutions either failed to load or required\npasswords to access. It is unclear why the Hainan University\nCybersecurity Department’s website is password protected—an\nuncommon security protocol compared to other universities\nexamined in this report. The increased security measures may well\nhave been implemented following the revelation of the school’s\nassociation with APT40, but this is not easily discernable.\n\nA search of available academic papers uncovered one paper\npublished on using ensemble learning methods, a machine learning\nframework, to create an early warning system for distributed denial\nof service attacks.[16] Hainan University has not published any other\nresearch related to AI/ML and cybersecurity.\n\n### Southeast University (东南大学) \n\n**_Connections to the Security Services_**\n\nProfessor Song Yubo (宋宇波) and Beijing TopSec, a company\nknown to provide cybersecurity services to the PLA and MSS,\nhosted a hacking competition in early 2014 for Southeast\nUniversity students.[17] Unlike normal capture-the-flag competitions\nwhere participants hack other teams for points, Professor Song\noffered students a real-world opportunity to earn points and gain\nprestige by attempting to access the network of a U.S. DoD\ncontractor, VAE, Inc.[18]\n\nIn preparing the computer infrastructure for the hacking\ncompetition, Professor Song accidentally left a trail of indicators\nconnecting him, the competition, and the VAE operation. Song set\n\n\n-----\n\nup websites meant to fool VAE employees into giving up their\ncredentials in the days leading up to the competition; VAE\nconfirmed spearphishing attempts at the same time as the\ncompetition.[19] Not only did the timing of the websites align with\nthe competition, but Song used the same registration company and\nnaming conventions to create both the competition registration\nwebsite and the websites used for the hacking operation. Such\noverlapping procedures could be coincidental; one registration\ncompany can serve many clients. But, Song also made an\noperational security error when compiling his malware, by\naccidentally programming his malware to call back to the same IP\naddress he used to register the competition’s website, connecting\nhim, the competition, and the malicious websites.[20]\n\nMonths after the attempted attacks on VAE, Inc., the same\nmalware from the competition was found on a website targeting\nAnthem Insurance employees.[21] The 2019 DOJ indictment of\nChinese hackers for the Anthem Insurance hacks did not name\nSong, however. The relative exclusivity of the malware and its\nconnection to Deep Panda, the Crowdstrike designation for a\nChinese state-sponsored hacking team, suggests that Song and\nthe team that hacked Anthem Insurance had access to the same\ntools—either through sharing or centralized distribution.[22]\nMoreover, Song registered the malicious VAE websites using the\nname of a Marvel comic book character—the same theme used to\nregister infrastructure for the hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel\nManagement, another major Chinese operation.[23]\n\nAside from Song Yubo, Southeast University has a strong\ninstitutional relationship with China’s information warfare\nprograms. A 2012 report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic\nand Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman\ndetermined that Southeast University faculty—including Song[24]—\nreceived regular funding from five programs for “the modernization\nof state secrecy, the technical professionalization of the PLA, and\nthe continuing development of information conflict capabilities.”[25]\nAs of 2012, funds from these five programs—the 863 National\nHigh Technology Research and Development Program (国家高技术\n研究发展计划), the 973 National Key Basic Research Program (国家\n高技术研究发展计划), the National 242 Information Security\n\n\n-----\n\nProgram (国家 242 信息安全计划项目), Ministry of State Security\n115 Program (国家安全部 115), and the National S219 Information\nSecurity Application Demonstration Project (国家 S219 信息安全应\n用示范工程)—were selectively distributed to a small group of\nuniversities; it is unclear if these programs are still disbursing\nfunds. Only two other universities, Harbin University and Zhejiang\nUniversity, received funding from all five information warfare\nprojects as of 2012—both are tied to APTs and covered in this\nreport.\n\nSoutheast University continues to build upon its relationship with\nthe security services in the information domain. A university\nwebpage touts Southeast University partnering with the PLA\nStrategic Support Force to establish the Purple Mountain Internet\nCommunications and Security Research Lab (网络通信与安全紫金\n山实验室), which opened in 2018.[26] PLA SSF researchers and\nSoutheast University faculty at the lab work together on “important\nstrategic requirements”, computer operating systems, and\ninterdisciplinary cybersecurity research.[27] In the same year, the\nuniversity established a “security self-investigation and selfcorrection working group” for the cybersecurity academy’s\n“laboratory and important venues”—perhaps to guard against\ninsider threats to research.[28] Other engagements revolve around\nhands-on learning and job placement. Southeast University\nconnects students to the security services via job postings and\nresearch positions. One post-doctoral position with the MSS 13[th]\ndivision works on “APT attack detection, and vulnerability\ndiscovery and exploitation.”[29] A web page for prospective students\nhighlights that graduates often go on to work for the MSS, among\nother possible careers.[30]\n\n**_Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity_**\n\nProfessor Song, the academic who facilitated the VAE, Inc. hacking\ncompetition, is now researching how to use machine learning for\nanomaly detection—a technique that looks for unusual patterns of\nnetwork behavior.[31 ]Song is just one of many Southeast University\nprofessors who has accepted funding from any of the three\nsecretive funding programs for information security research. Dr.\nJiang Rui (蒋睿), a three-time recipient of MSS 115 Program (国家\n\n\n-----\n\n安全部 115) funding, is currently researching data protection\ntechnology for distributed machine learning systems on behalf of\nthe Ministry of Public Security.[32] Other professors also received\nMSS 115 Program (国家安全部 115) or National 242 Information\nSecurity Program (国家 242 信息安全计划项目), but do not conduct\nML-related cybersecurity research.\n\nAnother group of Southeast University faculty also research ML\nand cybersecurity, but do not appear to receive government\nfunding for their research. Li Tao (李涛) focuses on smartphone\nsecurity and vulnerabilities, and claims to research AI applications\nfor cybersecurity, but has only listed one publication related to AI.[33]\nQin Zhongyuan (秦中元) researches AI for malware classification\nand attack detection systems—both applications help defenders\nfortify networks.[34] Another professor, Yang Wang (杨望), invites\nstudent applicants to assist with his research on cyber threat\nintelligence, cyberattack attribution technologies, and security\nchallenges for AI systems.[35] According to Yang’s webpage,\napplicants for research positions should be familiar with machine\nlearning, cybersecurity posture awareness technology, and threat\nintelligence modeling and analysis.[36] The requisite skills for\napplicants and declared direction for the research project—\nautomated cybersecurity response (自动化安全响应)—suggests a\nfocus on ML-based anomaly detection and threat attribution\ntechnologies.\n\n### Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学)\n\n**_Connections to the Security Services_**\n\nThe first murmurs of Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s (SJTU)\nrelationship with state-sponsored hackers date back as far as\n2010. In an article published by The New York Times, unnamed\nmilitary contractors provided evidence that someone at SJTU was\nconducting network operations against foreign targets, including\nGoogle and the U.S. government.[37] Three years passed before\nevidence of the relationship surfaced again.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2013, Mandiant published its ground-breaking APT1 report that\nnamed PLA Unit 61398 as an Advanced Persistent Threat to the\nU.S. government and non-Chinese companies. Based on the\nattribution of attacks to Unit 61398, investigative reporters at\nReuters identified three computer science articles that SJTU\nacademics co-authored with members of Unit 61398.[38] One of the\nacademic authors implausibly claimed he was unaware of his coauthor’s ties to the PLA—insisting that the co-author was a\ngraduate student—even though a military unit designation\nappeared next to the operator’s name on the paper.[39] The technical\narticles demonstrated that the academics were directly\ncontributing to research that could be used for network operations\nand were doing that research alongside people from military units\ncarrying out those operations. The Reuters journalists also\ndetermined that SJTU’s School of Information Security Engineering\n(上海交通大学信息安全工程学院) was co-located on an\n“Information Security Engineering Base” run by the PLA,\nestablishing another clear connection between SJTU and the PLA.\nFollowing the DOJ indictments of Unit 61398 a year later, another\nreport found that one of the hackers had used his university email\naddress to register infrastructure used in a hacking campaign.[40]\nRumors about SJTU and its connection to Chinese government\ncyber operations evolved into irrefutable facts over the four years\nfrom 2010 to 2014.\n\nThis report finds that the relationship between SJTU and statesponsored hacking teams almost certainly continues today. The\nSJTU’s Cyberspace Security Science and Technology Research\nInstitute (上海交通大学网络安全技术研究院) stands out for its\npotential impact on cyber operations and as a vehicle for\ncooperation. The Network Confrontation and Information System\nSecurity Testing (网络攻防与信息系统安全检测) project works on\n“network and information system testing and evaluation, security\ntesting for intelligent connected networks, APT attack testing and\ndefense, and key cyber range technology.”[41] Research priorities,\nlike “APT attack testing and defense,” explicitly state the intent to\ndevelop offensive and defensive technologies for APT (read:\ngovernment-backed) cyber operations. Other enumerated areas of\nresearch include “password cracking, social engineering, and\n\n\n-----\n\ncreating active honeynets.”[42] Password cracking and social\nengineering are used to gain unauthorized network access and are\noffensively oriented. While penetration testers can use these\ntactics against consenting organizations to improve their defensive\nposture, the institute makes no mention of providing such services.\nThe most likely application is for offensive cyber operations.\nAdditionally, SJTU hosts a few AI research organizations, including\nthe AI Security Laboratory, whose mission is to increase the\nsecurity and defenses of ML algorithms.[43]\n\nBesides this research, the biographies of two professors stand out\nfor their stated impact on the security services. Dr. Qiu Weidong’s (\n邱卫东) research on AI and graphical processing unit\noptimization—a key component for training AI systems—led to the\nwidespread adoption of his cryptographic techniques by \"many\ncore national security ministries,\" presumably including the security\nservices.[44] Another professor, Dr. Chen Xiaohua (陈晓桦), served as\nthe Executive Deputy Director (常务副主任)—likely second or third\nin the chain of command—of the national-level MSS 13th Bureau,\nknown publicly as the China Information Technology Security\nEvaluation Center (CNITSEC), before becoming a professor.[45]\nStandard-setting cryptographical research and experience running\na bureau of an intelligence service are good indicators of SJTU’s\nreputation among cybersecurity professionals in China.\n\n**_Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity_**\n\nResearchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University published seven\npapers on using AI for defensive purposes over the last five years.\nResearchers published on defensive ML applications such as\nidentifying malicious URLs[46], inspecting web traffic to identify\nbotnets[47], attributing certain types of DDOS attacks[48], and a litany\nof specialized intrusion detection systems.[49] Other research topics\nhave dual-use applications. One paper funded by the Ministry of\nPublic Security researched the application of machine learning for\nstatic vulnerability analysis of software.[50] Vulnerability analysis\nfinds weaknesses in software that can be patched by defenders or\nexploited by attackers; how vulnerabilities are used after their\ndiscovery is up to the user. Another paper proposed a machine\nlearning model that could differentiate Tor web traffic from other\n\n\n-----\n\ntraffic—a tool that would allow a state with comprehensive\nsurveillance and collection capabilities to isolate otherwise\nobscured internet connections; China has obvious incentives to use\nsuch a tool.[51] Other work sheds the veneer of dual-use research\nand benefits only attackers. A paper published in 2019 increased\nthe accuracy of password guessing attacks by using a machine\nlearning model to generate password attempts.[52]\n\nIn addition to the work of individual professors, the Network\nConfrontation and Information System Security Testing (网络攻防\n与信息系统安全检测) project, mentioned above, also conducts\nresearch on the use of AI and machine learning for computer\nnetwork attack and defense. Though sourcing for this assertion is\nlimited, the documents available speak volumes. The MSS 13th\nBureau published an article by the director of the SJTU research\ninstitute in its Cyberspace Strategy Forum periodical.[53] The article\nconsiders the potential offensive and defensive applications of AI in\ncomputer network operations, as well as the vulnerabilities of AI\nsystems themselves. In one section, the director—concurrently the\ndirector for the National Engineering Laboratory for Information\nContent Analysis Technology (信息内容分析技术国家工程实验室)—\nhighlights using AI to repair software vulnerabilities, support\nnetwork attack and defense, and find software vulnerabilities for\nexploitation in the malware development process.[54 ]The piece\nconcludes by making two arguments. First, AI holds potential for\ndefensive cybersecurity applications like intrusion detection, threat\nintelligence management, and the ability to construct intelligentsecure networks (构建网络安全智能模型). Second, it contends that\nfurther research on AI is the solution to AI’s current vulnerabilities.\nThe publication of the article by the MSS 13th Bureau\ndemonstrates the service’s interest in such capabilities and\nillustrates the deference it pays to the research and analysis of\nSJTU faculty.\n\nBesides the publication, two other pieces of evidence point\ntowards research on ML applications for cyber operations by the\nCyberspace Security Science and Technology Research Institute.\nFirst, a recent job posting for a training program manager (培训业务主\n\n管) gave preference to applicants with a background in\ncybersecurity and a strong understanding of AI security.[55] Second,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe description of responsibilities for part of the program includes\n“AI-based vulnerability discovery and testing,” the same offensive\napplication the director noted in his article.[56] Taken together, the\nhigh-level publication on AI and cybersecurity in an MSS periodical,\nthe job posting seeking applicants with a cross-disciplinary\nbackground, and the research institute’s description of its own\nwork provides strong evidence that researchers are working on AI\nfor cyber offensive and defensive purposes. In light of one program\nconducting “APT attack testing and defense” and SJTU’s past\nrelationship with PLA cyber operators, it is reasonable to conclude\nsuch research could directly support state-sponsored hacking.\n\n### Xidian University (西安电子科技大学)\n\n**_Connections to the Security Services_**\n\nGuangdong ITSEC, a division of the MSS 13[th] Bureau and the\nmanaging organization for APT3, started working with Xidian\nUniversity in 2017 to offer a jointly administered graduate program\nunder the Network and Information Security School (网络与信息安\n全学院).[57] Xidian University awards degrees and handles\nadmissions; Guangdong ITSEC facilitates hands-on education and\npairs graduate students with MSS employees serving as mentors.[58]\nTogether, Guangdong ITSEC and Xidian University graduate\nstudents pursue research projects that meet the “actual needs” (实\n际需求) of Guangdong ITSEC—solving technical problems to\nenable the MSS’s work. The relationship between Guangdong\nITSEC and Xidian University is unusual; not only is the jointlyadministered degree a novel program, but the two institutions are\nlocated more than 1,000 miles apart. Xidian University’s\ninvolvement may be explained by Guangdong ITSEC’s collection\npriorities. APT3 changed its mission to targeting residents of Hong\nKong in 2015.[59] Practicing offensive cyber skills on Hong Kongers\nis no different than an internship with the Ministry of Public\nSecurity since China considers Hong Kong to be an “internal affair.”\nThis is conjecture, however. There are no reports that Xidian\nUniversity supported past operations and this is the first report\nestablishing the university’s relationship with the Guangdong\nITSEC.\n\n\n-----\n\nXidian University students are not limited to just one division of the\nMSS 13[th] Bureau, however. The university also established a joint\nresearch laboratory and internship program with Shaanxi ITSEC in\n2017. The two committed to “jointly launch information security\nassurance and posture evaluation services for China, Shaanxi\nProvince, and Shaanxi's prefecture-level cities\" among many other\nresponsibilities.[60] Shaanxi ITSEC is not connected to any publicly\nknown APT groups or hacking campaigns.\n\nXidian University’s relationship with PLA information warfare units\nextends at least a decade. In 2011, Xidian University established a\nrelationship with the 3PLA and 4PLA, both now under the PLA\nStrategic Support Force, when it constructed the Collaborative\nInnovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding (信息\n感知技术协同创新中心).[61] This project was a continuation of its\nhistoric ties to the CCP—Mao Zedong established the forerunner to\nXidian University in 1931.[62]\n\n**_Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity_**\n\nTwo Xidian University professors claim an affiliation with China’s\nsecurity services and are conducting research on AI and\ncybersecurity.\n\nDr. Zhang Yuqing (张玉清) joined Xidian University after having\nfirst served as the director of the National Computer Network\nIntrusion Prevention Center (国家计算机网络入侵防范中心主任), a\ngovernment body tasked with securing computer networks, and\nserving as the Deputy Director of the National Engineering\nExperimental Laboratory for Technology to Prevent and Cure\nComputer Viruses (计算机病毒防治技术国家工程实验室副主任).[63]\nZhang’s research at Xidian is focused on network confrontation,\nvulnerability discovery and exploitation, and the intersection of AI\nand cybersecurity.[64] In his most recently published academic paper,\nZhang and researchers from the National Computer Network\nIntrusion Prevention Center—his former employer—surveyed more\nthan 200 papers on using AI for cybersecurity tasks.[65] The paper\nanalyzed possible applications of ML for data mining, vulnerability\ndiscovery and exploitation, and automated patching of software\nvulnerabilities. Zhang and his colleagues determined that using AI\n\n\n-----\n\nfor automated vulnerability discovery was likely the most useful\napplication and made recommendations for future research to\novercome the technology’s (2018) limitations at the time. The\nproject would likely prove useful to one of its funders, the\nUnclassified Projects Program at the Key State Laboratory for\nInformation Security (信息安全国家重点实验室的开放课题), which\ncould use the research to inform grant distributions to other\nacademics working on ML and cybersecurity. The actual impact of\nthe report is unknown, however.[66]\n\nA second academic, Dr. Yang Chao (杨超), has active connections\nto the security services and conducts research on AI applications\nfor cybersecurity.[67] While at Xidian University, Dr. Yang has\nsubmitted more than 20 software vulnerabilities to China’s\nNational Vulnerability Database (CNNVD, 国家信息安全漏洞库)—a\ndivision of the MSS 13th Bureau. Fifteen of these received\ncertification from the government as critical vulnerabilities, though\nmost were apparently related to payment systems within China.[68]\nHis work on cybersecurity earned him a national defense research\nproject funded by the now-defunct PLA General Armaments\nDepartment Development Fund and a current “high-level\nconsulting position” with the MSS 13[th] Bureau Xibei office.[69] Yang\ndescribes his research as including “data-driven AI intelligent cyber\nthreat detection and [developing a] “hunter” defense system\narchitecture; AI and big data analysis-based detection of\nmalignancies in encrypted traffic; machine learning-based\nencrypted traffic (SSL, Tor, VPN, ShadowSocks) / private internet\nprotocol recognition and investigation; data analysis and machine\nlearning-based cyberspace virtual persona recognition, matching,\nand investigation.”[70] Each of Yang’s research topics tightly\nintertwines ML and cybersecurity and could be put to good use in\nhis consulting position at the MSS 13[th] Bureau’s Xibei office.\n\nAcademics at Xidian University without acknowledged or known\nties to the security services are also conducting similar research. A\npaper focused on defensive research published in 2019 proposed\nand demonstrated using machine learning to classify malware\nsamples based on patterns in behavior.[71] The resulting model could\nbe used to detect attacks from new malware with behaviors similar\nto that of older, known malware. Research using machine learning\n\n\n-----\n\nfor behavioral detection of new attacks is a common theme in\ncurrent research on AI and cybersecurity.[72] Another Xidian\nUniversity paper from 2017 proposed a similar ML-based solution\nto classifying malware, though that research focused on\novercoming inadequate training data.[73]\n\nOther academics are conducting research on less defensive, more\ndual-use topics. An article from 2019 compared algorithms that\nconduct membership interference attacks on ML systems, an\nexploit that allows attackers to determine if a given piece of data\nwas part of the model’s training data.[74] For example, a membership\ninterference attack on a facial recognition system may allow the\nattacker to determine if the system can identify a particular face.[75]\nThough the researchers qualified their research by demonstrating\nhow to defend against such attacks, the paper concluded with\nexamples of attacking commercially available algorithms to\nevaluate which data sets had been used to train targeted models.\n\n### Zhejiang University (浙江大学)\n\n**_Connections to the Security Services_**\n\nZhejiang University is a highly-respected, internationally renowned\nschool for cybersecurity studies. Unsurprisingly, the PLA vigorously\nrecruited graduates of its program at the time Mandiant published\nits APT1 report in 2013.[76] A report prepared for the U.S.-China\nEconomic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman\nfound that Zhejiang University received funding from three\nsecretive programs for information security research: China’s\nNational 242 Information Security Program (国家 242 信息安全计\n划项目), the Ministry of State Security 115 Program (国家安全部\n115), and the National s219 Information Security Application\nDemonstration Project (国家 s219 信息安全应用示范工程).[77] The\nreport also concludes that universities which received these funds\nwere selected to conduct “sensitive research and development\nwith information security and information warfare applications.”[78]\n\nThough never tied to a specific hacking campaign, this report finds\nthat Zhejiang University has collaborated on research with\nmembers of the PLA SSF. Zhejiang University academics co\n\n-----\n\nauthored a research paper with members of PLA Unit 61646 in\n2018.[79] Also known as the Air Reconnaissance Bureau, Unit 61646\nwas originally organized under the PLA General Staff Department’s\n2[nd] Department and responsible for military intelligence until its\nreorganization in 2015-16.[80] The joint paper evaluated SM4, a\nthen-common encryption protocol that played an “important role as\na national encryption standard” in China.[81] Together, Zhejiang\nUniversity academics and members of Unit 61646 concluded that\nSM4 encryption protocol is weak and easy to circumvent.\n\n**_Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity_**\n\nClasses taught at, and research conducted by, Zhejiang University\nsuggest the school’s graduates are well prepared for jobs involving\ncyber operations, making them great recruits for China’s security\nservices and national champion companies alike. Indeed, the joint\nZhejiang University-Fudan University team beat the team from\nCarnegie Mellon in the 2020 DEFCON Capture-the-Flag\ncompetition.[82]\n\nCybersecurity is not the only relevant area of focus at Zhejiang\nUniversity, as the school is also teaching undergraduate students\nhow to attack and defend AI/ML systems.[83] Under its Applied\nSecurity curriculum, Zhejiang University teaches AI-related courses\nincluding: Algorithm and Model Security, Backdoors in Models,\nData Poisoning, Adversarial Example Attacks, Measures for\nDefending Against Adversarial Example Attacks, and Certifiable\nSecurity for AI (人工智能可证明性安全).[84] In addition, Zhejiang\nUniversity’s Applied Security program is conducting research on\n“malicious machine learning” (恶意机器学习).[85]\n\nEach of these topics is central to protecting or attacking AI\nsystems. Data poisoning attacks target the training data of a\nmodel; manipulating the inputs in such a way that the deployed\nsystem fails to function properly.[86] Undetected data poisoning\nattacks can slow the development of a system, increasing costs\nand undermining its functionality. Other vulnerabilities allow\nattackers to make models fail in specific, predictable ways.\nBackdoors in models allow for the attackers to designate a specific\noutcome given a certain trigger.[87] A backdoor attack against a\n\n\n-----\n\nfacial recognition model could allow anyone wearing a purple hat\nto be recognized as a particular person, for example. Defending\nagainst these types of attacks is critical for any organization or\nbusiness integrating AI models into operations.\n\nIn the course of their degrees on cybersecurity, AI and information\nsecurity at Zhejiang University, students pick up some\ngovernment-focused skills along the way. The program offers\ncourses on intelligence[88] entitled: “the evolution and definition of\nstrategic intelligence, the relationship between induction and\ndeduction in intelligence research, intelligence classification, and\ncrafting [intelligence] reports.\"[89] Understanding the intelligence\ncycle and writing intelligence products is likely to be of little\nrelevance to employees outside the national security sector.\nCombined with classes on AI vulnerabilities—which require\nfamiliarity with how systems can be attacked—the evidence\nsuggests that Zhejiang University students are well-prepared for a\njob in the security services.[90]\n\nFull-time faculty at Zhejiang University who teach AI/ML attack and\ndefense classes are on the cutting-edge of research in the area. Dr.\nJi Shouling (纪守领), an international participant on eight US\nNational Science Foundation-funded research projects, recipient of\nthe China’s 1000 Young Talents Program (2017) and the Zhejiang\n1000 Talent Program (2016), has his own research institute at\nZhejiang University which conducts research on AI for\ncybersecurity.[91] In an arrangement that typifies the issues of\nChina’s talent programs, Ji simultaneously holds a research faculty\nposition at Georgia Institute of Technology. One non-NSF paper\npublished by Ji proposes a tool called “VulnSniper,” which uses\nneural networks to find new software vulnerabilities.[92] It is one\nexample from dozens of papers published by Ji’s research program\nat Zhejiang University.\n\nDr. Yang Ziqi (杨子祺), another professor in the cybersecurity\nprogram, focuses his research on the attack and defense of AI\nsystems. After receiving his doctorate from Singapore National\nUniversity, Yang conducted research for the Singapore\nCybersecurity Agency National Lab, Kaspersky Labs, and Huawei.\nYang’s research on AI security includes model inversion,\n\n\n-----\n\nmembership interference, adversarial attack and defense, and\nbackdoors in models.[93] Membership interference attacks pair well\nwith Yang’s other research into model inversion of commercially\navailable facial recognition systems.[94] Together, these two\ntechniques can determine whether a particular face is recognized\nby a targeted facial recognition system. Other applications of\nYang’s research include using AI to trace the origins of malware\nbinaries based on information about the compiling author.[95]\n\nIn addition to full-time professors conducting research, Zhejiang\nUniversity has hosted many guest lectures on attacking AI systems\nand defending their vulnerabilities. Topics from guest lecturers\nhave included: Neural Network Inversion in Adversarial Settings[96],\nAttack and Defense of Deep Neural Network Models[97], Federated\nLearning-Oriented User Privacy Attacks[98], Data Set Inference and\nReconstruction Attacks in Online Learning[99], and Stealthy Attacks\nAgainst Automatic Speech Recognition.[100] These attacks pose\nmyriad problems for users of AI systems. Neural network\ninversions reveal technical details about the data used to train a\nspecific model—potentially exposing sensitive or classified data\nused in training the model.[101] Other attacks, rather than exposing\ninformation, manipulate mundane systems to the attacker’s\nadvantage. The presentation on “Stealthy Attacks Against\nAutomatic Speech Recognition” systems demonstrated how to\nembed secret commands in songs, which when played, can direct\nvirtual assistants—like Google Home, Amazon Echo, or Apple’s\nSiri—to perform certain tasks. Though research of this nature is\ncommon in cybersecurity, the relationship between Zhejiang\nUniversity and China’s cyber operators is uncommon. Moreover, a\nrecent CSET report demonstrates how hard it is to defend AI\nsystems—vulnerabilities are pervasive and defensive techniques\nare often only temporary patches.[102] As more organizations and\ngovernments deploy AI systems, the attack surface for such\ntechniques will grow.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学)\n\n**_Connections to Security Services_**\n\nThe Mandiant APT1 report named Harbin Institute of Technology\n(HIT) as a recruitment center for Chinese cyber operators in\n2013.[103] HIT is not alleged to have supported specific operations,\nthough the university’s ties to the military would make any such\nsupport unsurprising. As one of the Seven Sons of National\nDefense—a collection of universities with deep historical ties to the\ndefense industry and PLA—HIT has received an institutional topsecret clearance to work on military projects.[104] HIT’s cybersecurity\nschool touts working on nine government-funded research\nprojects, including research done on behalf of the now-defunct\nPLA General Armaments Department Key Laboratory Fund and the\nMSS, among other research funders.[105] Legacy webpages show\nmany graduates of HIT’s cybersecurity school from 2008 to 2014\nwent to work for the PLA’s 54[th] Research Institute, formerly part of\nthe General Staff Department’s 4[th] Department (Electronic\nIntelligence, or ELINT), an organization folded into the PLA\nStrategic Support Force in 2015.[106] The U.S. DOJ indicted four\nmembers of the 54[th] Research Institute in 2020 for the 2017\nEquifax hack.[107]\n\n**_Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity_**\n\nAcademics based at the Harbin Institute of Technology published\nfew research articles on ML applications for cybersecurity or AI\nvulnerabilities. Instead, the vast majority of its faculty’s publications\n(49 of 51) examined the application of AI to other fields, including a\nsignificant focus on the medical field. The two papers published on\nML and cybersecurity rehashed recurrent themes in the field. One\ngroup of researchers built a machine learning model to detect and\ncategorize software vulnerabilities.[108] The other publication\nproposed using AI to create an intrusion detection system based\non behavior analysis.[109]\n\nThe relative scarcity of publications on ML and cybersecurity topics\nis surprising, given HIT’s reputation as a cutting-edge\ncybersecurity school. It may well be the case that the university’s\n\n\n-----\n\ninstitutional top-secret clearance prevents the publication of such\nresearch. Another CSET report on China’s defense technology\nworkforce found that China’s central government designated a\nMicrosoft-HIT Artificial Intelligence and Machine Translation Joint\nLaboratory as a Key State Laboratory in 2006.[110] Moreover, the\nsame report found that Microsoft Research Asia worked with HIT\nto create its computer science curriculum and provided training to\nprofessors in 2018 and 2019 on AI and natural language\nprocessing technology.[111] In fact, the presence of such international\npartnerships may be the reason that HIT shies away from\npublishing or even conducting such research.\n\nBut there are more indicators that HIT is performing, but not\npublishing, research on AI and cybersecurity. The Computer\nApplication/Cyberspace Security Research Center, an affiliate of\nthe cybersecurity school, conducts “research on key technologies in\nprivacy-protecting machine learning.”[112] Though the phrase is\nambiguous, other sources use the same phrase when discussing\nthe issue of ML model security.[113] Here, the description of HIT’s\nresearch center denotes work on securing machine learning models\nfrom attacks that may divulge information from training data or\nother aspects of the model. To secure these models, researchers\nattack newly-developed defenses to test their efficacy. The\nacknowledgment of defensive research is also a tacit\nacknowledgment of offensive capabilities, though the attack\nmethodologies used are not necessarily new or developed inhouse.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusions\n\nExamination of China’s AI/ML research and computer network\noperations to date demonstrates that six key universities play a\nmajor role in not only building technical competencies, but also in\nmoving the research out of the lab and operationalizing it.\nResearch currently conducted at these six universities\ndemonstrates interest in both sides of the AI/ML and cybersecurity\ndivide—ML-based offensive and defensive techniques, and the\nattack and defense of AI systems themselves. In addition to\ntechnical research from all six institutions, two of the schools\npublished high-level strategic papers on the intersection of\nmachine learning and cybersecurity. Xidian University’s paper,\nfunded by the Key State Laboratory for Information Security\nUnclassified Projects Fund, conducted a wide-ranging review of\ncurrent (2018) research, determining machine learning could make\na significant impact on vulnerability discovery and exploitation.[114]\nThe conclusions of that paper were reiterated in an MSS\npublication written by faculty from Shanghai Jiao Tong University,\nwhere affiliated programs are conducting research on AI-based\nvulnerability discovery and “APT attack and defense.”[115] The state\nof technical research in China is such that work on machine\nlearning and computer network operations has moved from the\nresearch lab to strategic policy publications.\n\nThe close relationships between universities and the state shortens\nthe path to operationalizing new techniques and provides the\nsecurity services quick access to talented researchers. As nations\nand organizations deploy AI systems with unknown vulnerabilities,\nChina’s hacking teams will have new avenues of attack.\nConversely, China’s government and private sector will also seek to\ndefend their own systems. Enhanced protection of China’s\ncomputer networks and AI systems will be at least one outcome of\nconducting this research. Though research benefits both offensive\nand defensive applications, the relationships of these institutions\nwith the security services augur the use of such knowledge in\nfuture hacking operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Author\n\nDakota Cary is a Research Analyst at the Center for Security and\nEmerging Technology.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nFor feedback and assistance, we would like to thank John\nBansemer, Ben Buchanan, Scott Harold, Ben Murphy, Anna Puglisi,\nHelen Toner, Emily Weinstein, Ryan Fedasiuk, Benjamin Pollack,\nand Kady Arthur.\n\n© 2021 by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology.

(https://perma.cc/56S5-SB2E) In late\n2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security placed the school on its End-User\nlist for acquiring technology for the PLA.
