Since releasing our public\nreport, we have continued to investigate and report on\nGhostwriter activity to Mandiant Intelligence customers.\nWe tracked new incidents as they happened and identified\nactivity extending back years before we formally identified\nthe campaign in 2020. This report provides an update on\nGhostwriter, highlighting two significant developments.\n\nWe have observed an expansion of narratives, targeting\nand TTPs associated with Ghostwriter activity since we\nreleased our July 2020 report. For example, several recent\noperations have heavily leveraged the compromised social\nmedia accounts of Polish officials on the political right to\npublish content seemingly intended to create domestic\npolitical disruption in Poland rather than foment distrust of\nNATO. These operations, conducted in Polish and English,\nappear to have largely not relied on the dissemination\nvectors we have typically observed with previous\nGhostwriter activity, such as website compromises,\nspoofed emails or posts from inauthentic personas.\n\n\nRecently obtained technical evidence now allows us to\nassess with high confidence that UNC1151, a suspected\nstate-sponsored cyber espionage actor that engages in\ncredential harvesting and malware campaigns, conducts\nat least some components of Ghostwriter influence\nactivity; current intelligence gaps, including gaps\npertaining to website compromises and the operation of\nfalse personas, do not allow us to conclusively attribute\nall aspects of the Ghostwriter campaign to UNC1151 at\nthis time. We do not associate UNC1151 with any other\npreviously tracked threat groups. Since the start of\n2021, UNC1151 has expanded its credential theft activity\nto target German politicians. This targeting has been\npublicly reported in the German Tagesschau.[3]\n\nThe appendices of this report include an exhaustive\ntable of incidents and operations we currently associate\nwith Ghostwriter activity, a detailed case study of a\nrecent operation and indicators of compromise (IOCs)\nrelated to UNC1151.\n\n\n2 [FireEye (2020).

Angriff der “Chaostruppe”.](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/wdr/hackerangriffe-105.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Observed Expansion of Narratives, Targeting and TTPs associated with Ghostwriter Activity\n\n\nWhile we have continued to track and investigate\nGhostwriter influence activity that follows the typical\noperational model laid out in our July 2020 public report,\nwe have also observed an expansion of the narratives,\ntargeting and TTPs associated with Ghostwriter activity. For\nexample, in January, we began investigating five operations\nthat took place between October 2020 and January 2021\nin which the social media accounts of Polish officials were\ncompromised and used to disseminate narratives seemingly\nintended to discredit the Polish government domestically\nand to widen existing domestic political divisions.\n\n- The five operations used compromised Twitter, Facebook\nand/or Instagram accounts of Polish officials as the main\nvector for content dissemination. We have observed\nno evidence that these platforms were themselves\nin any way compromised, and instead believe social\nmedia account credentials were obtained using the\ncompromised email accounts of targeted individuals.\nThe takeover of high-profile social media accounts\nafter the operators have gained access to those users’\ncorresponding email accounts reinforces the continued\nimportance for potential campaign targets to secure their\nsocial media accounts with two-factor authentication.\n\n- Polish officials who are members of political parties\nwithin the ruling United Right political coalition\n(Zjednoczona Prawica), which currently holds power\nin Poland, were the primary victims of the observed\naccount compromises. The majority of United Right\ncoalition victims are either affiliated with the Law and\nJustice party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwoś or PiS) or the\nAgreement party (Porozumienie).\n\n\n**Activity Targeted Polish Domestic Politics**\nOverall, narratives promoted in the five operations\nappear to represent a concerted effort to discredit the\nruling political coalition, widen existing domestic political\ndivisions and project an image of coalition disunity in\nPoland (Table 1). In each incident, content was primarily\ndisseminated via Twitter, Facebook, and/or Instagram\naccounts belonging to Polish politicians, all of whom have\npublicly claimed their accounts were compromised at the\ntimes the posts were made. The incidents also touched on\nsome consistent themes: two involved the dissemination of\ncompromising photos of officials and people with whom\nthey are associated, two falsely implicated the respective\nofficials as criticizing female activists and one falsely\nclaimed that an official wanted to renounce her affiliation\nwith the PiS party. In some cases, we have relied on\nmedia reporting to reconstruct particular details of some\noperations’ content as the relevant posts were no longer\navailable at the time of investigation. In others, we were\nable to independently confirm the content of posts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 1. Five Ghostwriter operations involved the compromise of social media accounts belonging to Polish politicians to disseminate**\ncompromising material and/or fabricated narratives.\n\n|Date|Compromised Account|Incident Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|Oct. 29, 2020 Nov. 19, 2020 Dec. 15, 2020 Jan. 12, 2021 Jan. 18, 2021|Joanna Borowiak, PiS party (Twitter) Marcin Kamil Duszek, PiS party (Facebook) Marlena Maląg, PiS party (Facebook) Iwona Michałek, Porozumienie party (Twitter) Marek Suski, PiS party (Twitter) Ewa Szarzyńska (Twitter) Ewa Szarzyńska (Instagram) Ewa Szarzyńska (Instagram)|A tweet published to the Twitter account of Polish MP Joanna Borowiak called pro-choice activists “drug addicts-prostitutes and child killers” (Figure 1).4 A post published to the personal Facebook account of Polish MP Marcin Kamil Duszek featured private, compromising pictures of a woman, some of which also included Duszek himself. The post introduced the woman as Duszek’s new secretary and stated that his “fellow Members [of parliament] will be jealous”.5 A post published to the Facebook account of Poland’s Minister for Family and Social Policy, Marlena Maląg, condemned female activists involved in protests against then-forthcoming new abortion laws. The post used racial slurs to characterize the women and compared them to “brainless savages”.6 A tweet published to the Twitter account of Iwona Michałek, Poland’s deputy minister of development, labor, and technology, disseminated the false narrative that she no longer wanted to be affiliated with the PiS party. The tweet condemned PiS as the party of “murderers, thieves, and executioners” and featured a cartoon of PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński in prison (Figure 1).7 Compromising photos of a woman closely resembling Ewa Szarzyńska, a local politician from Mogilno, were disseminated by multiple accounts, including compromised Twitter and Instagram accounts belonging to Szarzyńska and the Twitter account of Polish MP Marek Suski. Additional posts to an Instagram account using Szarzyńska’s name included compromising photos appearing to feature Dobromir Szymański, an Inowrocław councilman and assistant to a deputy minister. We were unable to determine whether this account was Szarzyńska’s compromised account or a separate Instagram account impersonating her.8|\n\n\n**Figure 1.**\n\nTweet published\nto MP Joanna\nBorowiak’s\naccount criticizing\nfemale protesters\n(left, shown\nwith machine\ntranslation);\ntweets published\nto the account of\nIwona Michałek\nfeaturing a cartoon\nof Jarosław\nKaczyński in prison\n(right).\n\n4 [Konkret24 (October 30, 2020).

The specific websites used to publish and\ndisseminate this content have been used in previous\nGhostwriter operations.\n\n**October 2020 NATO-Themed Operation also Leveraged**\n**Compromises of Polish Officials’ Social Media Accounts**\nAnother suspected Ghostwriter operation promoted\na narrative between October 22-26, 2020, suggesting\nthat NATO is preparing its military for a war with Russia,\nwhich would ostensibly take place in Poland, Latvia and\nLithuania, a narrative consistent with those promoted\nin past Ghostwriter operations that appear intended to\nundermine NATO’s presence in—and security cooperation\nwith— those three specific countries. In addition to\nspreading this narrative via a fabricated article published\nto multiple websites, including sites used in previous\nGhostwriter operations, links to that article were also\ndisseminated via posts by multiple compromised social\nmedia accounts belonging to Polish officials. We observed\noverlaps between this operation and some of the Polish\nsocial media compromises referenced above.\n\n- The operation used at least three compromised social\nmedia accounts of Polish officials to disseminate links\nto the fabricated article published on three websites.\nThe accounts belong to two current members and one\n\n**Figure 2.**\n\nA fabricated article\nwas published\nto the Prawy.pl\nnews site (left)\nand to the county\nadministration\nwebsite of\nWschowie, Poland\n(right).

Borowiak claims her account\nwas compromised and she did not have access to her\nTwitter during this entire period.[10, 11]\n\n- The fabricated article concerned a NATO defense\nminister’s meeting that took place on October 22,\n2020, and appears to have appropriated text from a\nreal news article reporting on that meeting.[12] However,\nthe fabricated article was published under a different\ntitle and contained additional text. Both the new title\nand inserted text supported the narrative that Poland\nis at the epicenter of the coming war between NATO\nand Russia. The article was published to at least two\nPolish-language news sites, Prawy.pl and Obserwator\nNadodrzański (ono24.info), and to the county\nadministration website (wschowa.info) for Wschowie,\nwhich is in Poland’s Lubusz province (Figure 2). We were\nnot able to independently determine whether these\nwebsites were compromised in this instance (a common\ntactic seen in previous Ghostwriter operations), but we\nnote that Prawy.pl has been compromised as part of\nprevious Ghostwriter operations and both Prawy.pl and\nwschowa.info have since removed the article.\n\n\n9 [Konkret24 (October 30, 2020).

UNC1151\nintrusion activity has been active since at least 2017 and\nhas included credential harvesting campaigns targeting\nEuropean government and media entities as well as some\ninstances of using spear phishing to distribute malware. We\ndo not associate UNC1151 with any other previously tracked\nthreat groups and do not make any further attribution\nassessment at this time. Appendix 3: Technical Annex\npresents additional detail and MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n(T1547.001, T1218.005, T1059.005, and T1071).\n\n**UNC1151 Overview**\nUNC1151 has conducted numerous campaigns designed to\nsteal credentials and deliver malware via spear phishing.\nThe group uses an extensive array of domains that mimic\nmajor and regional web services and host pages designed\nto trick a victim into entering their credentials. Less\nfrequently, the group has distributed malware via phishing\nemails with malicious attachments, including RADIOSTAR,\nVIDEOKILLER and HALFSHELL malware.\n\n- **Credential Harvesting Operations:[13] UNC1151 was first**\nuncovered conducting credential harvesting operations\ntargeting government, military and media entities in\nPoland, Ukraine and the Baltics. UNC1151 has also targeted\npersonal email accounts of individuals of interest to\nthem, such as journalists and activists. Since the start of\n2021, this credential theft activity has expanded to target\nGerman individuals, with a focus on politicians.\n\n– UNC1151 credential harvesting domains often have\nbase domains or subdomains which spoof the\norganizations they seek to phish or popular (and\nsometimes regional) web services.\n\n\n– UNC1151 often uses long subdomains to make phishing\ndomains look legitimate.\n\n– UNC1151 has targeted thousands of personal and\ncorporate accounts with differing degrees of tailored\ncontent since 2017.\n\n� For example, on March 4, 2020 Mandiant Threat\nIntelligence discovered a spear-phishing email\nusing a spoofed “ukr.net” address targeting a\nUkrainian journalist. The email had been sent via\nthe SMTP2GO service and the Gophish framework.\nIt contained a malicious link that led to a spoofed\nlogin page designed to steal credentials.\n\n� We also identified a high-profile Belarussian\nblogger and activist targeted by UNC1151 credential\nharvesting operations.\n\n– The targeting of German individuals has been\nreported in the German media, including articles in\nDer Spiegel[14] and Tagesschau.[15] We believe that this\nreporting is referring to credential theft activities\nconducted by UNC1151. We have not seen follow-on\noperations using any potentially stolen credentials.\n\n- **Campaigns Using Malware:[16] UNC1151 has also**\ndistributed malware via spear phishing. The malware\nused has all been unique to this group. The malware is\ndelivered using straightforward phishing operations,\nlikely for espionage. The phishing emails from these\noperations most often have generic themes lacking\nconnections to contemporary events or disinformation,\nthough in some cases, lures have been related to\ninflammatory current events. For example, actors\nin one operation used a lure related to COVID-19\nmisinformation in Ukraine to deliver HALFSHELL\nmalware. Other campaigns using malware relied on less\ninflammatory lures such as bank safety notifications.\n\n\n13 See Appendix 3: Technical Annex for more details.\n[14 Spiegel Group (March 26, 2021).

For example:\n\n- UNC1151 has sent multiple emails that support or\nreference Ghostwriter operations. These emails do\nnot contain malware or attempt to steal credentials,\nbut instead distribute operational narratives. In one\noperation, UNC1151 sent emails in April 2020 with links\nto a fabricated article posted on a compromised Polish\nmilitary website (See Table 2: Polish Soldiers Should\nRebel Against American “Occupational Forces”) to\nfurther disseminate that operation’s narrative. On the\nsame day, UNC1151 sent additional emails to additional\nentities referencing the Polish government’s poor cyber\nsecurity and susceptibility to disinformation.\n\n- We discovered two blended Ghostwriter and cyber\nespionage operations against Lithuanian media\nentities in 2018[17] and 2019[18] which have been reported\non by the Lithuanian CERT. We were able to connect\nthe infrastructure used in these operations to UNC1151\ncredential harvesting operations that were active at\nthe time.[19]\n\n\n\n- The content, narratives and chronology of at least 13\nemails sent to various U.S. and European-based media\noutlets by UNC1151 using the Gophish framework align\nwith previously identified Ghostwriter operations. We\ndetailed seven of these operations in our public report\non Ghostwriter released in July 2020.\n\n- Our UNC1151 data contains a copy of a forged letter\npurportedly sent from NATO Secretary General Jens\nStoltenberg to Lithuanian Minister of National Defense\nRaimundas Karoblis announcing the withdrawal of NATO\nforces from Lithuania due to COVID-19 concerns, which\nwe previously determined was used as part of an April\n2020 Ghostwriter operation.\n\n- Technical indicators suggest that the email accounts\nof the Polish officials whose social media accounts\nwere used in the domestically focused operations\ndetailed previously were likely compromised by\nUNC1151 during the same timeframe that their\ncompromised social media accounts were used to\nsupport Ghostwriter activity.\n\n\n[17 National Cyber Security Centre, Republic of Lithuania (January 29, 2018).

The narrative,\nwhich appeared intended to create tensions between\nPoland and Lithuania and undercut local support for the\nimplicated individuals and government institutions, was\ndisseminated via a fabricated article and fabricated official\nstatements promoted using multiple compromised websites\nand at least two suspected compromised social media\naccounts. We believe the narrative was also potentially\ndisseminated via emails using a spoofed elected official’s\nemail address. We assess with moderate confidence\nthat this operation comprises part of the Ghostwriter\ninfluence campaign based on observed consistencies in\nthe promoted narrative, employed tactics, techniques and\nprocedures (TTPs) and targeting.\n\n- On February 26, 2021, the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs published an official statement confirming an\n“information attack on Lithuanian-Polish relations” and\nreferencing individuals implicated in the operation.[21]\nPolish officials and ministries have likewise published\nand/or promoted related posts on social media\nconfirming the compromise of officials.[22, 23]\n\n- The operation used various dissemination vectors to\npromote a set of fabricated statements from officials\nand a fabricated news article to establish narrative\ndetails. This dissemination strategy may have been\ndesigned to imitate a pattern of official statements\nand media responses that would unfold around the\nrevelation of an actual government scandal to impart\na greater sense of legitimacy to the narrative and\npotentially increase its reach.\n\n\n**Narrative Summary and Dissemination**\nThe operation promoted a narrative alleging that the\nPolish Ministry of National Defense uses female officers\nto provide “escort services” for important Polish and\nforeign officials. A named female officer was alleged to\nhave provided such services for Polish President Andrzej\nDuda, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis\nand senior U.S. military representatives. We identified\nmultiple vectors by which we believe this narrative was\ndisseminated. We were unable to confirm the exact\ntimeline of dissemination. However, details included\nin different pieces of promoted content, including\nscreenshots of or references to previous social media\nposts and other material, enabled us to reconstruct a\ngeneral timeline of activity (Figure 3). In all but one\ninstance of suspected compromise, we observed public\nstatements issued by the victims and/or government\nofficials or organizations claiming the respective websites\nor social media accounts had been compromised.\n\n\n[21 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania (February 26, 2021).

The tweets included screenshots of, and a link to,\na profile page allegedly belonging to the implicated female\nofficer on a website for “casual” intimate meetups, featuring\npictures of a woman in uniform with officials, as well as images\n\nWłodzimierz Bernacki of a similar-looking woman engaged in sexual activities.[*]\n(Twitter)\n\nThe official website of Elżbieta Witek, Marshal of Poland’s\nSejm (Poland’s lower house of parliament) from the PiS party,\nwas reportedly compromised and used to publish a fabricated\n“official” response to the tweets by Bernacki’s Twitter account.\nThe post included a screenshot of one of those tweets.[**]\n\nElżbieta Witek\n(elzbietawitek.pl)\n\nA fabricated article posted on February 25 to the website of\nTygodnik Solidarność, a Polish weekly magazine, reported\non the “news” of the Polish military prostitution scandal. The\narticle referenced the fabricated statements published to\nBernacki’s Twitter account and Witek’s website, and provided\nnew supposed details about the officials allegedly implicated\nin the scandal. Tysol.pl published a follow-up article confirming\n\nTygodnik Solidarność that their website had been compromised and leveraged to\n(Tysol.pl) publish the fabrication.[***]\n\nThe Twitter account of Jakub Marciniak, whose bio lists affiliation\nwith Porozumienie’s youth organization Young Right (Polish:\nMłoda Prawica), was used to further disseminate the narrative.\nAt least 35 tweets directed at various Polish media outlets,\nofficials and government institutions, and other notable\nindividuals, included links to the then-compromised website\nof Elżbieta Witek. Some also included a link to the file upload\nwebsite AnonFiles that allowed for the download of the same\n\nJakub Marciniak compromising photos linked to in the tweets by Włodzimierz\n(Twitter) Bernacki’s account.[****]\n\nReports suggest that emails spoofing the email address\nof Lithuanian MP Aušrinė Norkienė further disseminated\nthe narrative, which implicated Lithuania’s foreign minister, in\nLithuanian.

The operation blended tactics traditionally associated with Ghostwriter\noperations with the expanded campaign tactics discussed previously.\n\n\n\n- The operation’s narrative, which focused on portraying\nthe Polish military and Polish, Lithuanian and U.S.\nofficials negatively, is consistent with those observed in\npast Ghostwriter operations, which are likely intended\nto create tension in regional security partnerships\nby promoting false narratives surrounding accidents\nor scandals as detrimental to local populations. This\noperation appears to be an attempt to discredit the\nPolish military as an institution and undermine PolishLithuanian relations.\n\n- Multiple suspected compromised social media accounts\nbelonging to individuals affiliated with political parties\nin Poland’s ruling United Right coalition were used\nfor narrative dissemination. As noted earlier, recent\nGhostwriter operations have used compromised social\nmedia accounts belonging to Polish officials to both\nseed and disseminate narratives. The targeting of\nindividuals affiliated with parties of the United Right\ncoalition in this operation is consistent with the profiles\nof other individuals whose social media accounts were\npreviously compromised and used.\n\n- Compromising photos were disseminated as “evidence”\nto support the operation’s narrative, similar to the\nmultiple recent Ghostwriter operations targeting\nPolish domestic political issues. In this operation,\ncompromising photos were initially included in\ntweets published to a Polish official’s compromised\naccount, and then again in tweets issued from a\nsecond suspected compromised account via a link to\n\n\nthe file download website AnonFiles. This pattern of\ndisseminating compromising photos to seed narratives\nand then amplifying them further via an AnonFiles\ndownload link is consistent with the January 18, 2021,\n“Polish Politician Posts Compromising Sexual Photos of\nFormer PiS Mayoral Candidate” operation.\n\n- We suspect the operation used two compromised\nwebsites to promote fabricated content. The website\nof Tygodnik Solidarność, to which the fabricated article\nwas published, subsequently claimed the fabrication\nhad been published following a website compromise.[24]\nStanisław Żaryn, spokesperson for Poland’s MinisterSpecial Services Coordinator, stated on social media\nthat content was “placed” on Elżbieta Witek’s site as\npart of the operation.[25] Past Ghostwriter operations\nhave frequently involved the compromise of news and\ngovernment websites to publish fabricated content.\n\n- Emails spoofing the official email address of Lithuanian\nMP Aušrinė Norkienė potentially further disseminated\nthe narrative in Lithuanian. Lithuania’s parliament, the\nSeimas, issued a statement on February 26, which\nindicated that emails were sent “illegally indicating” the\nemail address of Norkienė as part of an “information\nattack” against Lithuania and Poland.[26] Multiple\npreviously observed Ghostwriter operations have used\nspoofed official email addresses to directly disseminate\nnarratives and supporting fabricated material. We\ndocumented this as a frequently used campaign\ntactic,[27] and we have continued to see it used in other\nGhostwriter operations since.\n\n\n[24 Tysol.pl (February 26, 2021).

RADIOSTAR\nmalware may have been used in a Ghostwriter campaign\nin 2018 targeting Lithuania; this case appeared to be\nan exception, as we do not often observe Ghostwriter\ninfluence operations use malware. This case also led us to\ndiscover additional UNC1151 activity using VIDEOKILLER.\nUNC1151 has also used HALFSHELL malware to target\na Ukrainian entity in 2020 with a potential COVID-19\ndisinformation nexus.\n\nWe have observed UNC1151 using malicious documents to\ndeliver malware to victims in phishing operations. Much\nof the data we have for UNC1151 is historical and thus, in\nmany cases, we were unable to obtain payloads beyond\ninitial malicious documents sent via phishing email. In the\nfew instances where we have observed UNC1151 malware,\nit has been rudimentary.\n\nTargets of these operations span the following regions:\n\n- Poland\n\n- Lithuania\n\n- Estonia\n\n- Ukraine\n\n- Ireland\n\n- Colombia\n\n- Switzerland\n\n- Germany\n\nMany emails were sent to personal email addresses\nwhose owners which we were unable to identify. However,\ntargets we have identified include:\n\n- Activists\n\n- Media outlets\n\n- Government entities\n\n- Military/defense entities\n\n- Academic entities\n\n- Lawyers/law firms\n\n\n**UNC1151 Espionage and Ghostwriter Influence**\n**Operations in Lithuania**\nMandiant Threat Intelligence was able to connect\ninfrastructure used in two Ghostwriter operations\ntargeting Lithuanian media entities in 2018 and 2019 to\nthen-ongoing UNC1151 credential harvesting operations.\nThese operations allowed us to uncover additional\nUNC1151 malware campaigns.\n\n**2018 Campaign: “Lithuanian Minister of National Defense**\n**Committed Sexual Assault”**\nIn January 2018, a suspected English- and Lithuanianlanguage Ghostwriter operation promoted the narrative\nthat multiple government officials and a journalist had\ncome forward with allegations of sexual assault against\nLithuanian Defense Minister Raimundas Karoblis, and\nalso falsely claimed that Karoblis was homosexual.\nThe narrative was first published in an article on the\ncompromised Tv3.lt website in Lithuanian. A link to the\narticle hosted on the compromised site was also directly\nemailed to a targeted mailing list including government\nministries and embassies. Shortly thereafter, an English\nversion of the narrative was disseminated by a known\nGhostwriter persona, Rudis Kronitis, on multiple sites as\nwell as on two suspected Ghostwriter-controlled blogs in\nEnglish and Lithuanian, respectively.[30]\n\nThe document was delivered via phishing email to\nLithuanian media and government entities.[31] Although\nwe were not able to recover a copy of the email, the\nindicators in the Lithuanian CERT report enabled us to\nidentify that the email was sent using a legitimate email\ndelivery service called SMTP2GO, which can be used\nto mask the sender’s real IP address. According to the\nreport, the attacker attempted to spoof the sender to\nmasquerade as tv3.lt but made a typo such that the\nsender was “noreplay@tv3.lt” instead of “noreply@tv3.lt.”\n\nThe lure document attached to the email purported\nto be a legitimate press release. It included a link to a\nfabricated article posted on the Tv3.lt website and an\nappended legitimate copy-and-pasted article on the\ndefense minister.\n\n\n[28 National Cyber Security Centre, Republic of Lithuania (January 29, 2018).

The dissemination email’s header\ninformation indicates that the email originated from\nthe IP address 94.103.82.136. In January 2019, we had\nobserved that this IP was used by UNC1151 to register\nmultiple domains with names similar to European, Middle\nEastern and political activism and journalism entities. After\nadditional investigation, we were able to determine that\nIP address was a dedicated actor-controlled server for\nUNC1151 and thus saw a direct connection between this\nGhostwriter operation and UNC1151.\n\nAdditional technical details can be found in a Lithuanian\nCERT report.[32]\n\n\n**Other UNC1151 Campaigns**\nAfter referencing activity outlined in the Lithuanian CERT\nreports related to Ghostwriter operations in 2018 and 2019,\nMandiant Threat Intelligence was able to identify additional\nUNC1151 espionage activity. This included malware\ncampaigns masquerading as a Polskie Radio newsletter,\na “gift” campaign with an unknown purpose, a COVID-19\nthemed campaign and a campaign masquerading as the\nUkrainian polling agency SOCIS.\n\n**Polskie Radio Campaign using RADIOSTAR**\nIn one case, we discovered an UNC1151 lure document\nmasquerading as a Polskie Radio newsletter that\ncontained copy-and-pasted inflammatory political news\narticles from a Polish news outlet as a part of a phishing\ncampaign. According to the Polskie Radio outlet,[33] the\nemails were sent from Russian email addresses and\ncontained links which, upon user execution, would\ndownload the malicious document.\n\nThe lure document was hosted at the following location:\n\nhttps://gallery.mailchimp[.]\ncom/49b72c249fd120fb72b31dd09/files/bf25a5c6f9b6-4c06-b7ce-eff03ab2b459/news.03.doc\n\nThis link redirected to the link where the document was\nhosted:\n\nhttps://fashionhouse.us17.list-manage[.]com/track/\nclick?u=49b72c249fd120fb72b31dd09&id=\n3bd8c79d59&e=2169aaf971\n\n\n[32 National Cyber Security Centre, Republic of Lithuania (April 30, 2019).

We were unable to\nrecover this string during our investigation. However,\nwe believe that after running this secondary PowerShell\ncommand, the attacker attempts to download an\nobfuscated .NET dropper, the VIDEOKILLER dropper,\nfrom the C&C server. After dropping and launching the\nbackdoor, the VIDEOKILLER dropper kills the process.\n\nVIDEOKILLER is a .NET backdoor similar to RADIOSTAR\nthat handles commands from the C&C server. It\nmasquerades as conhost.exe. The majority of strings it\ncontains are Base64 encoded, though some are not, such\nas the string “It’s Ok” which is potentially used for logging\nthroughout execution.\n\nThe malware maintains its persistence on the victim’s\nsystem using the following registry keys:\n\nKey: HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\nCurrentVersion\\Run\\\nValue: %TEMP%\\conhost.exe\n\n\nIt then calls out to the C&C server using the following\nmethods from the WebClient class:\n\n- DownloadData\n\n- UploadString\n\n- DownloadString\n\n- UploadData\n\n- DownloadFile\n\nVIDEOKILLER checks for several possible strings C&C\nserver response:\n\n- cd\n\n– Traverse directories based on string input, return\ncurrent directory after traversal\n\n- set-content\n\n– Write data to file\n\n– There is no error message sent to the C&C for this\ncommand\n\n- get-content\n\n– Gets content of a data stream at specified location\nusing PowerShell and parses it\n\n– If an exception is thrown, sends “<Prog Error>” to the\nC&C\n\n- start\n\n– Executes the string as a command using PowerShell\n\n– If an exception is thrown, sends “Exec error” to the C&C\n\n- dir -Force\n\n– Executes the string as a command using PowerShell\n\n– If an exception is thrown, sends “Exec error” to the C&C\n\nIf none of the above strings appear in the response, then\nthe malware attempts to run the received string using\nPowerShell, returning the result of execution as a string.\nIf an exception is thrown, the malware sends “<Not\nResolved>” to the C&C server.\n\nAs with RADIOSTAR, all communications between\nVIDEOKILLER and the C&C server are XOR-encoded with\nthe key “65.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFiles dropped:\n\n- %TEMP%\\win.exe\n(MD5: 36c81100c86a491e628105884bdfeab8)\n\n– VIDEOKILLER dropper\n\n– .NET dropper, obfuscated with Eazfuscator\n\n– Compile Time: 2010-06-09 17:59:44\n\n– Drops and starts backdoor, conhost.exe\n\n- %TEMP%\\conhost.exe\n(MD5: 90adaadf02f2e1a90bdae790de7d565f)\n\n– VIDEOKILLER backdoor\n\n– .NET backdoor, obfuscated with Eazfuscator\n\n– Compile Time: 2010-11-03 17:54:35\n\n– Can upload and download files, set persistence, traverse\ndirectories, conduct a system survey, and execute\nfunctionality based on commands from the C&C\n\n– Configured C&Cs:\n\n� http://88.99.104[.]179:1985/update/microsoft_crpn\n\n� http://88.99.104[.]179:1985/update/microsoft_corp\n\n� http://88.99.104[.]179:1985/update/microsoft_crp\n\n**Figure 9.**\n\nCoronavirus\nthemed\nphishing email\nwith malicious\nattachment.\n\n**Translation:**\nAccording to the data, currently in Ukraine there\nare 5 laboratory confirmed cases of covid-19\n(Kyiv – 2, Lviv – 2, Kharkiv – 1).\n\nTemporary anti-epidemic commissions have\nbeen established and prepared in all oblasts\n\nregional plans for the prevention and spread of\nepidemic measures cases of covid-19 disease.\n\nMore information on the coronavirus in the\nattachment.\n\nReport the threat to your family and colleagues.\n\nst. 41 Yaroslavska Str., Kyiv, 04071\n+380 44 425 43 54\ninfo@moz.gov.ua\n© Public Institution “Public Health Center of the\nMinistry of Health of Ukraine”\n\n\n**HALFSHELL Targeting Ukraine**\nA phishing email with a malicious attachment was sent to\na Ukrainian victim purporting to be from the Ministry of\nHealth of Ukraine on February 20, 2020 with the subject\n“Короновірус в Україні підтверджено” (Coronovirus\nin Ukraine confirmed).
