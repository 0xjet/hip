The webpage contained a\nhidden image which was observed between June and December 2019, and referenced\ndomains associated with malicious activity conducted by the xHunt campaign operators.\n\n[We believe that the same threat actors involved in the Hisoka attack campaign compromised](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-attacks-on-kuwait-shipping-and-transportation-organizations/)\nand injected this HTML code into this website in an attempt to harvest credentials from the\nwebsite’s visitors; specifically, gathering account names and password hashes. While we\n\n\n-----\n\ncannot confirm this, it is possible that the actors intended to crack these hashes to obtain the\nvisitor’s passwords or using the hashes gathered to carry out relay attacks to gain access to\nadditional systems.\n\nIf successful in harvesting account credentials, the compromised data has a plethora of uses\nfor the attackers and can allow them to breach an organization to steal sensitive information.\nFurthermore, because they'd be using trusted credentials, it can allow attackers to go\nundetected for long periods of time, enabling them to infiltrate other parts of an organization\nand even implement backdoors, like RATs, to get back into a system even after being\nremoved. This can result in significant damage to an organization over a prolonged period of\ntime.\n\nDuring this same timeframe, we observed an indication of DNS redirect activity on\ninfrastructure used by these same operators. The domains observed in redirect activity\nprimarily contained subdomains referencing an association with their organizational email\nservers further implying an interest in user credential harvesting.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from this threat. Our\n[Threat Prevention Platform with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention) [WildFire detects activity associated with these threat groups](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\n[while simultaneously updating the ‘malware’ category within the URL filtering for malicious](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/threat-detection-and-prevention/web-security)\n[and/or compromised domains that have been identified. AutoFocus customers can continue](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus)\n[to track xHunt Campaign activity by using the xHunt tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.xHunt)\n\n### Use of Responder on Kuwait Government Website\n\n[During open-source research of the xHunt Campaign, we identified a website belonging to a](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-attacks-on-kuwait-shipping-and-transportation-organizations/)\ngovernment organization in Kuwait referencing an image hosted on Hisoka associated\ncommand and control (C2) infrastructure. Beginning in May 2019, the image referenced the\ndomain microsofte-update[.]com but changed to learn-service[.]com in December 2019. As\nof January 2020, this image is no longer referenced on the webpage.\n\nWe analyzed the HTML code on this website, shown in Figures 1 and 2, in order to try and\nbetter understand how this organization’s website would attempt to load an image from a\ndomain known to host a C2 server used for malicious activity. Figure 1 shows the webpage’s\nattempt to load an image from the URI file:///\\\\microsofte-update[.]com\\c$\\. This URI does not\ndisplay to the website visitor due to the “visibility:hidden” style attribute. The URI uses the\n[“file” URI scheme with the fully qualified domain microsofte-update[.]com as the host and the](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8089)\n“c$” as the path to the image. We found this path particularly interesting, as the HTML would\nattempt to load the “C:” drive file share as an image on the remote server. Logically, the\nlegitimate inclusion of this code does not make sense as the “C:” drive itself would not load\nas an image. Figure 2 shows the December 2019 change in the URL hosting the image file,\nhowever, the rest of the code remained the same.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Image hosted on Kuwait government website Header in mid-2019\n\nFigure 2. Image hosted on Kuwait government website Footer in late-2019\nWe believe that the actors likely included this line of code in an attempt to passively harvest\naccount credentials in the form of NTLM hashes from the webpage’s visitors. Windowsbased machines can use NTLM hashes when authenticating with a server. It is possible that\nwhen visiting the webpage containing this code, the user’s browser will attempt to load the\nimage by accessing the file share on the remote server. To access this remote file share,\nWindows will perform an NTLM challenge-response authentication attempt. If the actorcontrolled server specified in the URI is configured to emulate the NTLM handshake and the\nwebsite’s visitor is on a local network that allows internal Windows networking protocols to\nreach the actor controlled server, such as Server Message Block (SMB) and NetBIOS, then\nthe actors could capture NTLM hashes and other system information for that visitor. After\ncapturing the NTLM hashes, the actor could crack the hash to obtain the user’s password or\nuse the hash in a relay attack. This could also enable a full breach of an organization and\nallow the attackers to go undetected for long periods of time.\n\nTo test this theory, we set up the [Responder tool on a server in our lab and configured the](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)\nenvironment to have the domain microsofte-update[.]com resolve to the server. We then\nvisited the website from another system in our lab that had the HTML code injected and\nobserved the Responder tool gathering the domain name, user name, IP address and NTLM\nhashes from the system on which we visited the website, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Spiderlab Responder collection output\n\n### DNS Redirects\n\nDuring the analysis of the Responder collection activity on the Kuwait organization’s\nwebpage, we observed an indication of DNS redirect activity in related infrastructure analysis\nwithin [AutoFocus. As shown in Figure 4 below, in May 2019, the domain belonging to an](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus)\norganization within Kuwait began resolving to infrastructure within a netblock utilized by the\nxHunt operators during that same timeframe.\n\nFigure 4. Example DNS redirect activity observed in April and May 2019\nPivoting on this activity within RiskIQ PassiveTotal, we were able to identify an additional\nGovernment organization in Kuwait with the same resolution change in April 2019.\n\nFigure 5. RiskIQ PassiveTotal indication of DNS redirect activity\nThese changes led us to additional DNS Redirect infrastructure associated with the xHunt\nactivities. We were able to identify DNS redirect activity surrounding both the 2018 Sakabota\nactivity as well as the 2019 Hisoka activity. All redirects observed were associated with the\nKuwait government and private sector organizations. Figure 6 shows a sample timeline of\nthe activity where the top row shows the target organizations, the middle row shows the\ninfrastructure change and the bottom row shows the related xHunt domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Sakabota and Hisoka DNS redirect activity Timeline\n[Similar to the activities reported by FireEye,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale.html) [Crowdstrike, and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/widespread-dns-hijacking-activity-targets-multiple-sectors/) [Cisco Talos, we too observed](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/04/seaturtle.html)\nthe creation of one or more Let’s Encrypt certificates created during the same time as the\nchanges in domain hosting, all of which contained the name of the redirected domain. It is\nunknown whether or not the DNS redirects were successful in capturing visitor information.\n\nThis activity further led us to take a look at the infrastructure previously reported in DNS\nredirect activities. We identified several interesting resolutions within the same IP range\nalthough not a direct overlap with other xHunt infrastructure activities. One particular\nresolution of interest is with the Sakabota related domain sakabota[.]com. This domain\nresolved to the IP address 185.15.247[.]140 in September 2018. Between December 2017\n[and January 2018, this IP was used in DNS hijacking activities. We also noted both OilRig](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/widespread-dns-hijacking-activity-targets-multiple-sectors/)\nand Chafer resolutions within these same IP ranges over varying timeframes. Many of the\nredirected domains contained the subdomain mx, mail, or owa, indicating that these\noperators were likely targeting mail credentials. These infrastructure similarities are shown in\nthe Appendix below.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe injected HTML code identified on the Kuwait organization’s website indicates a likely\nattempt to harvest credentials from the website’s visitors; specifically, gathering account\nnames and password hashes. We believe that the same threat actors involved in the Hisoka\nattack campaign conducted these activities.\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarities in infrastructure utilized by cyber threat operators targeting the Middle East are\nnot new. Infrastructure has often been reused and even shared in the past. The overlaps in\nDNS redirect activities with the xHunt Campaign and known threat operators show a\ncontinued interest in this attack method within that region.\n\nOur [Threat Prevention Platform with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention) [WildFire detects activity associated with these threat](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\n[groups while simultaneously updating the ‘malware’ category within the URL filtering for](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/threat-detection-and-prevention/web-security)\n[malicious and/or compromised domains that have been identified.
