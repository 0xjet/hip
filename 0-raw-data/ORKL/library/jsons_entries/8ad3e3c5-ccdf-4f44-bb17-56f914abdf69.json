This malware was found\n[around the same time the HermeticWiper was found, and based on publicly available](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/02/24/hermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine/)\ninformation from security community it was used in recent cyberattacks in Ukraine. The new\nransomware was likely used as a smokescreen for the HermeticWiper attack due to its nonsophisticated style and poor implementation.\n\nIn this report, we present our analysis of HermeticRansom, which we also call Elections\nGoRansom.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur findings in a nutshell:\n\nElections GoRansom (aka HermeticRansom) was used to target assets on the same\nday as HermeticWiper;\nThe developers used a sarcastic function-naming scheme related to US presidential\nelections;\nThe malware does not use any kind of obfuscation and has pretty straightforward\nfunctionality, suggesting it was created in a short amount of time.\n\n## HermeticRansom’ technical analysis\n\nThe malware is created in Golang and uses no anti-analysis components as string\nencryption, function names stripping, etc. After execution, it creates an ID which is later used\nas the key from the array of Latin alphabet characters and numbers using a standard Golang\nrand function:\n\n**_ID key generation routine_**\n\nThen the malware identifies hard drives present on the infected system and collects a list of\ndirectories and files, excluding the Windows and Program Files folders.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Folder profiling_**\n\nAfter that, the ransomware note is created as a “read_me .html” file and dropped to the\nuser’s Desktop folder. The note contains the victim ID and the actor’s contact emails on the\nProtonMail domain; emails are hard-coded as seen below:\n\n**_Ransomware note in HTML format_**\n\nThe malware utilizes a strange ineffective encryption workflow – it creates a copies of the\ninitial sample and runs them as separate processes for each file encrypted; copy names are\ngenerated using Golang GUID library functions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Self-copies made by HermeticRansom_**\n\nTo encrypt victims’ data, HermeticRansom relies on a list of hard-coded files types, as\nfollows:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_List of hardcoded file extensions to encrypt_**\n\nFiles are encrypted using the AES algorithm with the generated key. Then the AES key is\nencrypted with RSA-OAEP. OAEP is parameterized with a hash function that is used as a\nrandom oracle. The hashing function is SHA-256. The RSA public key is hard-coded as a\nbase64 blob. After decoding the key in JSON format, it is converted to a byte array:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Hardcoded encryption public key_**\n\nOnce files are encrypted, HermeticRansom appends a “.encryptedJB” extension to each.\nAlso the ProtonMail email address is appended to the filename:\n\n**_Encrypted files with the new extension_**\n\nThe malware structures and methods are named in a sarcastic manner related to US\npresidential elections.\n\n**_Unstripped function names_**\n\n\n-----\n\n## HermeticRansom attribution\n\nGiven the circumstances under which HermeticRansom appeared, including the date, time\nand victims’ geo-locations, we have moderate confidence it is connected with\nHermeticWiper’s general objectives – destroying or otherwise making Windows systems\nunusable due to data loss.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nHermeticRansom is an excellent example of a targeted attack preventing victims from using\ntheir data while also potentially acting as a smokescreen for further attacks. The simplicity of\nthe code, along with the grammar and spelling errors left in the ransom note, probably\nindicate that it was a last-minute operation, potentially deployed to boost the effectiveness of\nother cyber-attacks on Ukraine.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**HermeticRansom MD5**\n[d5d2c4ac6c724cd63b69ca054713e278](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/d5d2c4ac6c724cd63b69ca054713e278/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Wiper](https://securelist.com/tag/wiper/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nElections GoRansom – a smoke screen for the HermeticWiper attack\n\nYour email address will not be published.
