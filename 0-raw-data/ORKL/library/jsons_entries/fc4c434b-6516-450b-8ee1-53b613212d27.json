Threat\nactors target Internet of Things (IoT) devices for recruitment into malicious operations as IoT\ndevices’ configurations often leave them exposed, and the number of internet-connected\ndevices continue to grow. Recent trends have shown that operators are redeploying malware\nfor a variety of distributions and objectives, modifying existing botnets to scale operations\nand add as many devices as possible to their infrastructure.\n\nZerobot, a Go-based botnet that spreads primarily through IoT and web application\nvulnerabilities, is an example of an evolving threat, with operators continuously adding new\nexploits and capabilities to the malware. The Microsoft Defender for IoT research team has\nbeen monitoring Zerobot (also called ZeroStresser by its operators) for months. Zerobot is\noffered as part of a malware as a service scheme and has been updated several times since\nMicrosoft started to track it. One domain with links to Zerobot was among several domains\n[associated with DDoS-for-hire services seized by the FBI in December 2022.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-los-angeles-and-alaska-charge-6-defendants-operating-websites)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Microsoft has previously reported on the evolving threat ecosystem. The shift toward](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/)\nmalware as a service in the cyber economy has industrialized attacks and has made it easier\nfor attackers to purchase and use malware, establish and maintain access to compromised\nnetworks, and utilize ready-made tools to perform their attacks. We have tracked\nadvertisements for the Zerobot botnet on various social media networks in addition to other\nannouncements regarding the sale and maintenance of the malware, as well as new\ncapabilities in development.\n\nIn this blog post, we present information about the latest version of the malware, Zerobot 1.1,\nincluding newly identified capabilities and further context to Fortinet’s recent [analysis on the](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/zerobot-new-go-based-botnet-campaign-targets-multiple-vulnerabilities)\nthreat. Zerobot 1.1 increases its capabilities with the inclusion of new attack methods and\nnew exploits for supported architectures, expanding the malware’s reach to different types of\ndevices. In addition to these findings, we’re sharing new indicators of compromise (IOCs)\nand recommendations to help defenders protect devices and networks against this threat.\n\n## What is Zerobot?\n\nZerobot affects a variety of devices that include firewall devices, routers, and cameras,\nadding compromised devices to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) botnet. Using several\nmodules, the malware can infect vulnerable devices built on diverse architectures and\noperating systems, find additional devices to infect, achieve persistence, and attack a range\nof protocols. Microsoft tracks this activity as DEV-1061.\n\nThe most recent distribution of Zerobot includes additional capabilities, such as exploiting\nvulnerabilities in Apache and Apache Spark (CVE-2021-42013 and CVE-2022-33891\nrespectively), and new DDoS attack capabilities.\n\nMicrosoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown,\nemerging, or developing cluster of threat activity, allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set\nof information until we can reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor\nbehind the activity. Once it meets defined criteria, a DEV group is converted to a named\nactor.\n\n## How Zerobot gains and maintains device access\n\nIoT devices are often internet-exposed, leaving unpatched and improperly secured devices\nvulnerable to exploitation by threat actors. Zerobot is capable of propagating through brute\nforce attacks on vulnerable devices with insecure configurations that use default or weak\ncredentials. The malware may attempt to gain device access by using a combination of eight\ncommon usernames and 130 passwords for IoT devices over SSH and telnet on ports 23\nand 2323 to spread to devices. Microsoft researchers identified numerous SSH and telnet\nconnection attempts on default ports 22 and 23, as well as attempts to open ports and\nconnect to them by port-knocking on ports 80, 8080, 8888, and 2323.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to brute force attempts on devices, Zerobot exploits dozens of vulnerabilities,\nwhich malware operators add on a rolling basis to gain access and inject malicious payloads.\nZerobot 1.1 includes several new vulnerabilities, such as:\n\n**Vulnerability** **Affected software**\n\nCVE-2017-17105 Zivif PR115-204-P-RS\n\nCVE-2019-10655 Grandstream\n\nCVE-2020-25223 WebAdmin of Sophos SG UTM\n\nCVE-2021-42013 Apache\n\nCVE-2022-31137 Roxy-WI\n\nCVE-2022-33891 Apache Spark\n\nZSL-2022-5717 MiniDVBLinux\n\nSince the release of Zerobot 1.1, the malware operators have removed CVE-2018-12613, a\nphpMyAdmin vulnerability that could allow threat actors to view or execute files. Microsoft\nresearchers have also identified that previous reports have used the vulnerability ID “ZERO32906” for CVE-2018-20057, “GPON” for CVE-2018-10561, and “DLINK” for CVE-201620017; and that CVE-2020-7209 was mislabeled as CVE-2017-17106 and CVE-2022-42013\nwas mislabeled as CVE-2021-42013.\n\nMicrosoft researchers have also found new evidence that Zerobot propagates by\ncompromising devices with known vulnerabilities that are not included in the malware binary,\nsuch as CVE-2022-30023, a command injection vulnerability in Tenda GPON AC1200\nrouters.\n\nUpon gaining device access, Zerobot injects a malicious payload, which may be a generic\nscript called zero.sh that downloads and attempts to execute Zerobot, or a script that\ndownloads the Zerobot binary of a specific architecture. The bash script that attempts to\ndownload different Zerobot binaries tries to identify the architecture by brute-force,\nattempting to download and execute binaries of various architectures until it succeeds, as\nIoT devices are based on many computer processing units (CPUs). Microsoft has observed\nscripts targeting various architectures including ARM64, MIPS, and x86_64.\n\nDepending on the operating system of the device, the malware has different persistence\nmechanisms. Persistence tactics are used by malware operators to obtain and maintain\naccess to devices. While Zerobot is unable to spread to Windows machines, we have found\nseveral samples that can run on Windows. On Windows machines, the malware copies itself\n\n\n-----\n\nto the Startup folder with the file name FireWall.exe (older versions use my.exe). Microsoft\nDefender for Endpoint detects this malware and related malicious activity on both Windows\nand Linux devices. See detection details below.\n\nTo achieve persistence on Linux-based devices, Zerobot uses a combination of desktop\nentry, daemon, and service methods:\n\n**Desktop entry:**\n\nZerobot copies itself to $HOME/.config/ssh.service/sshf then writes a desktop entry file\ncalled sshf.desktop to the same directory. Older Linux versions use $HOME/.config/autostart\ninstead of $HOME/.config/ssh.service.\n\n**Daemon:**\n\nCopies itself to /usr/bin/sshf and writes a configuration at /etc/init/sshf.conf.\n\n**Service:**\n\nCopies itself to /etc/sshf and writes a service configuration at /lib/system/system/sshf.service,\nthen enables the service (to make sure it starts at boot) with two commands:\n\n_systemctl enable sshf_\n_service enable sshf_\n\nAll persistence mechanisms on older Linux versions use my.bin and my.bin.desktop instead\nof sshf and sshf.desktop.\n\n## New attack capabilities\n\nIn addition to the functions and attacks included in previous versions of the malware, Zerobot\n1.1 has additional DDoS attack capabilities. These functions allow threat actors to target\nresources and make them inaccessible. Successful DDoS attacks may be used by threat\nactors to extort ransom payments, distract from other malicious activities, or disrupt\noperations. In almost every attack, the destination port is customizable, and threat actors\nwho purchase the malware can modify the attack according to their target.\n\nThe following are the previously known Zerobot capabilities:\n\n**Attack method** **Description**\n\nUDP_LEGIT Sends UDP packets without data.\n\nMC_PING Meant for DDoS on Minecraft servers. Sends a handshake and\nstatus request.\n\n\n-----\n\nTCP_HANDSHAKE Floods with TCP handshakes.\n\nTCP_SOCKET Continuously sends random payloads on an open TCP socket.\nPayload length is customizable.\n\nTLS_SOCKET Continuously sends random payloads on an open TLS socket.\nPayload length is customizable.\n\nHTTP_HANDLE Sends HTTP GET requests using a Golang standard library.\n\nHTTP_RAW Formats and sends HTTP GET requests.\n\nHTTP_BYPASS Sends HTTP GET requests with spoofed headers.\n\nHTTP_NULL HTTP headers are each one random byte (not necessarily ascii).\n\nPreviously undisclosed and new capabilities are the following:\n\n\n**Attack**\n**method**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nUDP_RAW Sends UDP packets where the payload is customizable.\n\nICMP_FLOOD Supposed to be an ICMP flood, but the packet is built incorrectly.\n\nTCP_CUSTOM Sends TCP packets where the payload and flags are fully customizable.\n\nTCP_SYN Sends SYN packets.\n\nTCP_ACK Sends ACK packets.\n\nTCP_SYNACK Sends SYN-ACK packets.\n\nTCP_XMAS Christmas tree attack (all TCP flags are set). The reset cause field is\n“xmas”.\n\n## How Zerobot spreads\n\nAfter persistence is achieved, Zerobot scans for other internet-exposed devices to infect. The\nmalware randomly generates a number between 0 and 255 and scans all IPs starting with\nthis value. Using a function called new_botnet_selfRepo_isHoneypot, the malware tries to\nidentify honeypot IP addresses, which are used by network decoys to attract cyberattacks\nand collect information on threats and attempts to access resources. This function includes\n61 IP subnets, preventing scanning of these IPs.\n\nMicrosoft researchers also identified a sample that can run on Windows based on a crossplatform (Linux, Windows, macOS) open-source remote administration tool (RAT) with\nvarious features such as managing processes, file operations, screenshotting, and running\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands. This tool was found by investigating the command-and-control (C2) IPs used by\nthe malware. The script, which is used to download this RAT, is called impst.sh:\n\nFigure 1. The impst.sh script used\n\nto download the remote administration tool\n\n## Defending devices and networks against Zerobot\n\nThe continuous evolution and rapid addition of new capabilities in the latest Zerobot version\nunderscores the urgency of implementing comprehensive security measures. Microsoft\nrecommends the following steps to protect devices and networks against the threat of\nZerobot:\n\nUse security solutions with cross-domain visibility and detection capabilities like\n[Microsoft 365 Defender, which provides integrated defense across endpoints,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender)\nidentities, email, applications, and data. Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft\nDefender for Endpoint detect Zerobot malware variants and malicious behavior related\nto this threat.\n\n[Adopt a comprehensive IoT security solution such as Microsoft Defender for IoT to](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-iot)\nallow visibility and monitoring of all IoT and OT devices, threat detection and response,\nand integration with SIEM/SOAR and XDR platforms such as Microsoft Sentinel and\nMicrosoft 365 Defender.\n\nEnsure secure configurations for devices: Change the default password to a\nstrong one, and block SSH from external access.\nMaintain device health with updates: Make sure devices are up to date with the\nlatest firmware and patches.\nUse least privileges access: Use a secure virtual private network (VPN) service\nfor remote access and restrict remote access to the device.\n\nHarden endpoints with a comprehensive Windows security solution:\n\nManage the apps your employees can use through Windows Defender\nApplication Control and for unmanaged solutions, enabling Smart App Control.\nPerform timely cleanup of all unused and stale executables sitting on yours or\nyour organizations’ devices.\n\n## Detections\n\n\n-----\n\n**Microsoft Defender for IoT**\n\nMicrosoft Defender for IoT uses detection rules and signatures to identify malicious behavior.\nMicrosoft Defender for IoT has alerts for the following vulnerabilities and exploits which may\nbe tied to Zerobot activity:\n\nCVE-2014-8361\nCVE-2016-20017\nCVE-2017-17105\nCVE-2017-17215\nCVE-2018-10561\nCVE-2018-20057\nCVE-2019-10655\nCVE-2020-7209\nCVE-2020-10987\nCVE-2020-25506\nCVE-2021-35395\nCVE-2021-36260\nCVE-2021-42013\nCVE-2021-46422\nCVE-2022-22965\nCVE-2022-25075\nCVE-2022-26186\nCVE-2022-26210\nCVE-2022-30023\nCVE-2022-30525\nCVE-2022-31137\nCVE-2022-33891\nCVE-2022-34538\nCVE-2022-37061\nZERO-36290\nZSL-2022-5717\n\n**Microsoft Defender Antivirus**\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects the malicious files under the following platforms and\nthreat names:\n\nZerobot (Win32/64 and Linux)\nSparkRat (Win32/64 and Linux)\n\n**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint alerts with the following titles can indicate threat activity on\nyour network:\n\nDEV-1061 threat activity group detected\nAn active ‘PrivateLoader’ malware process was detected while executing\n‘Morila’ malware was prevented\n‘Multiverze’ malware was detected\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint also has detections for the following vulnerabilities exploited\nby Zerobot:\n\nCVE-2022-22965 (Spring4Shell)\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint’s Device Discovery capabilities discover and classify\ndevices.
