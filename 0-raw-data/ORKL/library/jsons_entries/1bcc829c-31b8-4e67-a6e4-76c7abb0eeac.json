Our investigation began with malicious emails sent to Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and\nKazakstan but turned up connections to watering hole sites focused on Indian military personnel and designed to drop a\nremote access Trojan (RAT) with a variety of data exfiltration functions. Our analysis shows that many of the campaigns\nand attacks appear related by common IOCs, vectors, payloads, and language, but the exact nature and attribution\nassociated with this APT remain under investigation.\n\nAt this time, the background and analysis in this paper provide useful forensics and detail our current thinking on the\nmalware that we have dubbed “MSIL/Crimson”.\n\n### Attack against Indian Embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan\n\nOn February 11, 2016, we discovered two attacks minutes apart directed towards officials at Indian embassies in both\nSaudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. Both e-mails (Fig. 1, 2) were sent from the same originating IP address (5.189.145[.]248)\nbelonging to Contabo GmbH, a hosting provider that seems to be currently favored by these threat actors. The e-mails\n[also likely utilized Rackspace’s MailGun service and both of them were carrying the same exact attachment.](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/mailgun)\n\n**Emails:**\n4a0728a48c393a480dc328c0e972d57c5493ee5619699e9c21ff7e800948c8e8,”def.astana” <def.astana@mea.\ngov.in>\n\n839569f031a2cb6e9ae1dc797b1bd7cce53d3528c8b5fbec21cecb0de3f5ac88,”def.riyadh” <def.riyadh@mea.\ngov.in>\n\n**Attachment:**\n3966f669a6af4278869b9cce0f2d9279, Harrasment (sic) Case Shakantula.doc\n_exploit: CVE-2012-0158_\n\n**Doc dropped:**\n6a69cd7a2cb993994fccec7b7e99c5daa5ec8083ba887142cb0242031d7d4966,svchost.exe\n_functionality: downloader_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: First email sent to Embassy of India, Astana, Kazakhstan_\n\n_Figure 2: Second email sent to Embassy of India, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this incident, the attachment was a weaponized RTF document utilizing CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded,\n[encoded portable executable (PE). To decode the embedded PE, the document’s shellcode first searches for the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable)\n0xBABABABA marker that, when found, will indicate the beginning position of the PE (Fig. 3). The PE is then decoded\nusing the key 0xCAFEBABE while skipping null DWORDs (Fig. 4). A final marker indicates the end of the PE file, which, in\nthis case, is the marker 0xBBBBBBBB. This decode routine, including other components of the exploit document, have\n[been discussed before and have been observed in completely unrelated incidents.](http://blog.malwareclipboard.com/2015/10/rtf-exploit-document-extraction.html)\n\n_Figure 3: Shellcode searching for 0xBABABABA marker_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Decoding of encoded PE and searching for terminator marker_\n\nAfter successful exploitation and decoding of the embedded payload, a family of malware we refer to as MSIL/\nCrimson will be executed on the victim’s machine. The first stage in infection is a downloader whose purpose is\nto download the more fully featured RAT component. The MSIL/Crimson downloader that was dropped (md5:\n3a67ebcab5dc3563dc161fdc3c7fb161) will attempt to download the full RAT from 213.136.87[.]122:10001 (Fig. 5). A full\ndescription and analysis of the MSIL/Crimson malware family is provided in the Technical Analysis section.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: MSIL/Crimson downloading RAT_\n\n### Fake blog with an Indian military emphasis leads to MSIL/Crimson and more\n\nWhile conducting research related to MSIL/Crimson, Proofpoint researchers discovered a malicious blogspot.com site\n(Fig. 6), intribune.blogspot[.]com, that appears to have been set up to lure Indian military officials into becoming infected\nwith MSIL/Crimson, njRAT, and possibly other malicious tools. This site is likely operated by the same actor(s) that carried\nout the previously discussed attacks on Indian embassy officials based on shared C&C infrastructure as discussed in the\nCluster Analysis section. Most of the published stories contain some method of directing potential victims to a malicious\npayload, although a few of the stories did not contain any malicious code at time of analysis. In the following articles from\nthis site, we see the threat actors conducting their malicious activities in multiple ways:\n\n1. Using hyperlinks via an image or text\n\n2. Using the same hypertext link in the article text, on the story’s image, and in an iframe\n\n3. The final article in this section contains a link to an additional website that is likely operated by the same threat\nactor(s) and connected to other email campaigns\n\n#### Lure articles\n\n**4 Sikh Army Officers being trialed in military court on alleged involvement with KLF**\n\n_Link: hxxp://intribune.blogspot[.]com/2015/11/4-sikh-army-officers-being-trialed-in.html_\n_Malicious Document Location: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/news/4%20Sikh%20Army%20Officers%20being%20trialed._\ndoc\n_Document: 0197ff119e1724a1ffbf33df14411001_\n_Type: Exploit,CVE-2012-0158,Embedded Payload_\n_Dropped: njRAT - 27ca136850214234bcdca765dfaed79f_\n_C&C: 5.189.145[.]248:10032_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Article lure leading to exploit document capable of installing njRAT on vulnerable machines_\n\n_Figure 7: Decoy document dropped by “4 Sikh Army Officers being trialed.doc”_\n\nOne notable difference between this article and the rest is that it contained an iframe pointing to the same document\nlinked to via the “Read More” hyperlink.

Again, there is an obvious India-targeted theme that suggests this malicious website\nis specifically targeted at that nation. After using the number submission form, victims are directed to another page\ncontaining the final link to download a malicious document (Fig. 16).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Download File lure containing document that ultimate leads to Crimson Downloader_\n\n#### Document Details\n_Location: hxxp://fileshare[.]attachment[.]biz/?att=1455255900_\n_Document: 18711f1db99f6a6f73f8ab64f563accc_\n_Document Name: “Call Details Record.xls”_\n_Type: VBS Macro_\n_VBS Location: hxxp://afgcloud7[.]com/logs/ssc.mcom_\n_Payload: 3cc848432e0ebe25e4f19effdd92d9c2 (MSIL/Crimson Downloader)_\n_Downloaded MSIL/Crimson RAT: 463565ec38e4d790a89eb592435820e3_\n\nAdditional payloads were found on the same server but in a different directory:\n\nhxxp://afgcloud7[.]com/com/psp.dlc-bk (hash: 62d254790834f30a79ee79305d9be837, also previously named psp.dlc)\nhxxp://afgcloud7[.]com/com/psp.dlc (hash: dd0fc222852f5d12fda2fb66e61b22f6)hxxp://afgcloud7[.]com/upld/updt.dll\n(hash: 0ad849121b4656a239e85379948e5f5d)\n\nBoth files in the “/com/” directory are malicious droppers that ultimately drop a decoy Excel spreadsheet and a\nMSIL/Crimson downloader. The spreadsheet is themed towards the Armed Forces Officials Welfare Organization\n(AFOWO) located in India, while the dropped downloader and downloaded RAT communicate with the same C&C\nas many of the previously discussed samples. An Excel spreadsheet named “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls” (hash:\n98bdcd97cd536ff6bcb2d39d9a097319) was also found containing a malicious macro that attempts to download a\npayload from hxxp://afgcloud7[.]com/com/psp.dlc . Additionally, the IP address (50.56.21[.]178) resolved from email.\nbooks2day.com (used in the embassy attacks). This IP has also recently resolved to email.afowoblog[.]in. We would not\nbe surprised if an email address using @afowoblog.in was used to send the malicious “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls”\nspreadsheet. Additional research related to this domain is provided in the Cluster Analysis section.\n\n**62d254790834f30a79ee79305d9be837 / dd0fc222852f5d12fda2fb66e61b22f6:**\n_Dropped Decoy Dropper: 29054da7a1f1fbd0cb3090ee42335e54_\n_Decoy Document: 66cd38a03282b85fceec42394190f420_\n_Payloads: 83a8ce707e625e977d54408ca747fa29 or 2c9cc5a8569ab7d06bb8f8d7cf7dc03a (both MSIL/Crimson_\nDownloader)\n_C&C: 213.136.87.122:10001_\n_Downloaded MSIL/Crimson RAT: 463565ec38e4d790a89eb592435820e3_\n\n**0ad849121b4656a239e85379948e5f5d**\nThe payload found in the “/upld/” directory (md5: 0ad849121b4656a239e85379948e5f5d) is the MSIL/Crimson SecApp\nmodule capable of downloading the full MSIL/Crimson RAT and all subsequent modules.

Even though the tool may possibly be used by several threat actors, our research\nindicates that the hundreds of Crimson samples may be clustered into a much smaller set of activity as described below.\n\n#### Cluster 1 - Operation Transparent Tribe and More\nThe first cluster is the largest with activity from over one hundred samples dating as far back as 2012 (Fig. 18). For this\ncluster, we started our analysis beginning with the email attacks on the Indian embassies and the fake Indian news blog.\nThe activity surrounding those two events uncovered numerous other samples hosted on attacker-controlled C&C that\nthen lead to at least one additional email attack campaign. On one of the C&Cs we discovered a Python-based RAT\n(Python/Peppy) whose activity very closely clusters to Operation Transparent Tribe. We have also observed this RAT\nbeing downloaded and executed along with MSIL/Crimson by Andromeda downloaders. In addition to Crimson and\nPeppy, we have observed the usage of Luminosity Link RAT, njRAT, Bezigate, Meterpreter, and several custom\ndownloaders.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 18: Maltego graph of cluster 1 activity (click here for the complete graph)](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/fig-18-separate.png)_\n\nThe attackers responsible for this activity appear have to used a mixture of compromised infrastructure (e.g., sahirlodhi[.]\ncom) and infrastructure owned solely by them (e.g., bbmsync2727[.]com). In many cases, the attackers used common\npatterns in naming their domains:\n\n  - _sync in domain name and file name_\n\n  - Repeated use of bb in domain name or filename, mostly bbm\n\n  - Ending second level domain names in four digits\n\nAdditionally, this cluster of activity has numerous instances where Contabo GmbH was used for C&C. However we never\nused that as a sole item to group activity together under this cluster. Next, we will discuss an additional email attack, the\nattachment.biz activity, and lastly the afowoblog.in domain, all of which we believe fall into this cluster.\n\n**Email campaign using “2016 Pathankot attack” Lure**\n\nWhile researching this activity, we discovered an additional email attack campaign using the [2016 Pathankot attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Pathankot_attack) as a\nlure (Fig. 19). This attack utilized a URL (hxxp://comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz/?att=1451926252) to deliver a compressed\nfile (md5: f689471d59e779657bc44da308246ac4) containing two MSIL/Crimson payloads using 193.37.152[.]28:9990 as\ntheir C&C.\n\n_Figure 19: email campaign using “2016 Pathankot attack” as a lure_\n\nThe attackers further increased the believability of their attack by including decoy files with each of the MSIL/Crimson\npayloads:\n\n_Sample 1: 65f6143d69cb1246a117a704e9f07fdc_\n_Original name: “Call Record and Tracking Route.scr”_\n_Dropped decoy: 2f821d8c404952495caae99974601e96,Audio file with image (Fig. 20)_\n_Decoy name: “Call Record and Tracking Route.mp3”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20: Audio file decoy, likely discussing Pathankot attack_\n\n_Sample 2: 723d85f905588f092edf8691c1095fdb_\n_Original name: “detail behind the scenes.scr”_\n_Dropped decoy: a523b090e9a7e3868d8d1fde3e1ec57d,PDF (Fig. 21)_\n_Decoy name: “detail behind the scenes.pdf”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21: Pathankot attack decoy_\n\n\n-----\n\n**ATTACHMENT.BIZ domain**\n\nWe discovered additional activity surrounding the attachment.biz domain that is being used to deliver malicious\ndocuments and payloads. The observed domains include:\n\n  - fileshare.attachment[.]biz\n\n  - comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz\n\n  - ceengrmes.attachment[.]biz\n\n  - email.attachment[.]biz (no links discovered)\n\nAll of the domains resolve to the same IP, 91.194.91[.]203 (Contabo GmbH). So far we have detected three separate\ncampaigns, although we’re unsure of the starting point for each of these incidents but are highly confident they exist in\nthis cluster of activity.\n\n_Link 1: hxxp://ceengrmes.attachment[.]biz/?att=1450603943_\n_Payload: 07defabf004c891ae836de91260e6c82, MSIL/Crimson_\n_Payload name: Accn Letter.scr_\n_C&C: 5.189.143[.]225:11114_\n\n_Link 2: hxxp://fileshare.attachment[.]biz/?att=1455264091_\n_Payload: 18711f1db99f6a6f73f8ab64f563accc,XLS VBS-downloader *_\n_Payload name: Air India Valid Destinations.xls_\n_*Same payload as delivered by hxxp://fileshare[.]attachment[.]biz/?att=1455255900 from the attacker’s cdrfox.xyz site_\n\n_Link 3: hxxp://comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz/?att=1453788170_\n_Payload: 45d3130a901b7a763bf8f24a908b1810,compressed archive_\n_Payload name: Message.zip_\n_Decompressed Payload: 765f0556ed4db467291d48e7d3c24b3b, MSIL/Crimson_\n_Decompressed payload name: Message.scr_\n_C&C: 193.37.152[.]28:9990_\n\n**AFOWOBLOG.IN Domain**\n\nWe have uncovered circumstantial evidence indicating that the afowoblog.in domain falls into this cluster of activity.\nThe domain was registered on or near February 24th, 2016 using the email address thefriendsmedia@gmail.com,\nwhich is also close to the same day that the “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls” attachment was uploaded to VT. We have\ndetected potentially connected activity as far back as June 2013 using the domain thefriendsmedia[.]com, where it\nwas used as an Andromeda C&C.\n\nIn one instance (Fig. 22, maltego graph), we observed an Andromeda payload communicate with\nbrooksidebiblefellowship[.]org to retrieve an additional Andromeda payload from lolxone[.]com that then used\nthefriendsmedia[.]com as its C&C. The original Andromeda also retrieved a Bezigate payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22: thefriendsmedia connection to Andromeda, lolxone[.]com, and Bezigate_\n\nFurthermore, we have observed lolxone[.]com hosting additional Bezigate payloads as well as the Python/Peppy\nmalware as shown in the graph below (Fig. 23). This activity can be further connected to the overall cluster via the Peppy,\nBezigate, and Andromeda C&Cs as shown in the complete Maltego graph (Fig. 25).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 23: lolxone[.]com and Andromeda connections to Python/Peppy, Bezigate_\n\n#### Cluster 2 - guddyapps/appstertech/sajid\nSome Crimson SecApp modules we came across did not download the expected RAT or downloader payload when it\nfirst communicated to its C&C. For example, sample: 85429d5f2745d813e53b28d3d953d1cd retrieved a downloader\nfrom 178.238.228[.]113:7861 . Once the downloader was executed, it then downloaded an XMPP library (md5:\nfee34da6f30a17e1fcc5a49fd0987169) and the XMPP-based Trojan (md5: d3094c89cad5f8d1ea5f0a7f23f0a2b1) we\nrefer to as Beendoor. Beendoor is a very interesting piece of malware and we were able to gather additional\ninformation about this variant's C&C, 178.238.235[.]143.\n\nMuch like Crimson and Peppy, Beendoor is capable of taking screenshots of the victims desktop. On Beendoor’s C&C\nwe were able to recover a screenshot that appears to have been taken from one of the malware developer’s computer\n(Fig. 24). In this modified screenshot we are bringing attention to a few key pieces of information:\n\n  - Identical “Anushka” image on desktop found on Beendoor C&C and used in Beendoor sample\n\n  - Folder structure similar to that found on the C&C\n\n  - Hardcoded paths found in Beendoor dropper binary (md5: 9b98abb9a9fa714e05d43b08b76c0afa)\n\n  - Same file names used by Beendoor and the XMPP library\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24: Screenshot of likely Beendoor developer’s desktop_\n\nAs shown in the figure, it seems likely that the Pakistan-based company Appstertech is somehow connected to the\nBeendoor malware. Based on the analysis of the folders and files on the Beendoor C&C, we can also conclude that this\nactivity is related to research published by CloudSek late last year.\n\nIn the Crimson samples that we found connected to Beendoor (Fig. 25), several of them used the same “Binder” dropper\nthat we observed in other clusters, including Cluster 1. Moreover, the C&C for this occurrence of Crimson and Beendoor\nare both hosted at Contabo GmbH, another similarity with other clusters surrounding the Crimson implant.\n\n_Figure 25: Maltego graph of Crimson<->Beendoor cluster_\n\n#### Cluster 3 - “Nadra attack in Mardan” Lure\nIn addition to the attack using the recent Pathankot attack as a lure, we discovered several samples that may have\nbeen used in recent attack campaigns utilizing the December attack in Mardan near a National Database and\nRegistration Authority (Nadra) as a lure. Several samples were uploaded to VT in compressed archives containing\nCrimson payloads along with possible decoys their respective droppers would have dropped. For example,\none of the payloads (md5: 51c57b0366d0b71acf05b4df0afef52f, “NADRA OFC.exe”) was uploaded to VT along\nwith an image (md5: be0b258e6a419b926fe1cfc04f7e575a) that can also be found here: hxxp://i.dawn[.]com/\nmedium/2015/12/56825d6d8f1a5.png which is linked to by an article about the attack: hxxp://www.dawn[.]com/\nnews/1229406\n\nFor this cluster of activity, we’re not currently aware of any droppers and so have decided to cluster it on its own. With\nthat in mind however, the TTPs for this campaign are nearly identical to the “Pathankot attack lure” campaign in Cluster\n1. Unsurprisingly, the C&C utilized in this campaign is hosted at Contabo GmbH. Lastly, the port used in these samples,\n11100, is the same port used by some of the samples we have grouped in Cluster 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n**g** | p p\n\n#### Cluster 4 - DDNS and Pakistan\nThe final cluster we would like to discuss include several samples all using DDNS for their C&C pointing to Pakistan IP\n(according to Whois) addresses. The majority of this activity is from 2013. Based on the slightly different TTPs (purely\nDDNS usage) and no use of Contabo GmbH, we have clustered this separately from other activity, even though we\nhave observed DDNS usage in Cluster 1 and the obvious overlap in tool usage. This activity is graphed in Figure 26\nand included in the IOCs section.\n\n_Figure 26: DDNS and Pakistan IP address Maltego graph_\n\n#### One Cluster to Rule Them All, Nothing Yet to Bind Them...\nThere are numerous overlaps between the clusters, including usage of the “Binder” dropper, attack lures, and most\nobvious, the usage of Contabo GmbH. Unfortunately we lack information regarding some of the found samples as far as\nhow they were used and in what campaigns, and so we have decided not to tie all the activity together. As we continue to\nresearch these incidents, we would not be surprised to find additional information linking all clusters together.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n#### MSIL/Crimson\nCrimson is modular in the sense that additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module are often utilized to\nperform functions such as keylogging and browser credential theft. Crimson infections also typically occur in stages.\nCrimson’s first stage is a downloader component whose primary purpose is to download a more fully featured RAT,\ntypically being the Crimson RAT component. The RAT component will then send system information to the C&C while the\nC&C will likely respond with additional module payloads.\n\nCrimson utilizes a custom TCP protocol for communicating to C&C (Fig. 27). Some of Crimson’s optionally downloaded\nmodules have no C&C capability and instead rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.\n\n_Figure 27: Crimson custom TCP C&C protocol_\n\n\n-----\n\nCrimson-infected victims may be spied on by their attackers via invasive methods such as through their webcam,\nstealing email from Outlook, and recording their screen. Some Crimson RAT variants support at least 40 individual\ncommands, while all the individual commands throughout the different versions of the RAT we researched are listed and\ndescribed in Table 1.\n\n_Table 1.

These modules include keylogging, browser credential theft, automatic searching and stealing of\nfiles on removable drives, and two different payload update modules. Lastly, there appears to be a module referred to as\n“remvUser” that we have not been able to locate.\n\n**URLDownload**\n\nWhen executed, this module will first check for the existence of a registry key: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\n_CurrentVersion\\last_edate . If the key does not exist then it will be created by the module and assigned a DateTime.Now_\nstring. This key is periodically checked for how many days have passed. Once the malware detects that at least 15 days\nhave passed, a HTTP GET request is sent to a hardcoded location to retrieve a text file that should point to another HTTP\nlocation containing a final payload. For example, one analyzed sample (md5: 532013750ee3caac93a9972103761233)\ncontained a hardcoded URL: hxxp://sahirlodhi[.]com/usr/api.txt. So far we have observed the attackers modify api.txt\ntwice first containing a link to: hxxp://bbmsync2727[ ]com/upd/secure scan exe and then: hxxp://bbmsync2727[ ]com/\n\n\n-----\n\nccmb/ssm.exe .\n\nIn the module that we analyzed, the downloader logic was configured to request a file from a hardcoded URL: hxxp://\nsahirlodhi[.]com/usr/api.txt, which is likely a compromised website. The module expects that another URL will be stored\nat the previously retrieved URL, which initially we found to be the following: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/upd/secure_scan.\nexe (md5: e456d6035e41962a4e49345b00393dcd). This payload is a MSIL/Crimson Downloader variant that, when\nexecuted, will begin the MSIL/Crimson lifecycle all over again by downloading a new controller/orchestrator.\n\n**secApp**\n\nThe secApp that we analyzed (md5: ccfd8c384558c5a1e09350941faa08ab) contained functionality very similar to the\ninitial downloader, however the initial beacon that is sent to the C&C was doupdat rather than updatc and was configured\nto connect to the same hardcoded C&C but to a different port. In addition to supporting the updatc command issued by\nthe C&C, this module also supports the following commands: info, upsecs, and upmain. The info command supports the\nsame functionality that the main RAT module supports while upsecs and upmain allows the controller to modify the path\nand application names for both the secApp and mainApp.\n\n**Credential Stealer**\n\nThe pssApp is a password harvesting module that initially appears to support retrieving saved credentials from the\nChrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers. Successfully harvested credentials are stored in a hardcoded location such as:\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\chrome\\chrome_update . If no credentials are found, the credential log will simply contain “Not\nFound> > <” while an example of successfully stolen credentials are shown in Figure xx. In our very limited testing, this\nmodule was not able to retrieve passwords from Opera 35.0.2066.68 or Firefox 44.0.2 but was successful with Chrome\n48.0.2564.116 m.\n\n_Figure 28: Successfully harvested credentials by the pssApp module_\n\nSome samples (md5: 8a991eec65bd90f12450ee9dac0f286a) also appear to support the retrieval of credentials from\nWindows Live, FileZilla, Vitalwerks’ Dynamic Update Client (DUC), and Paltalk.\n\n**Keylogger**\n\nThe keylogger module is a basic keylogger that stores keylogs in a plain text file (Fig. 29) in a hardcoded location. The\nmodule that we analyzed (md5: f18172d7bb8b98246cb3dbb0e9144731) was hardcoded to store keylogs in a file named\n“nvidia” in the following location: %APPDATA%\\NVIDIA\\ .\n\n_Figure 29: Data stored in “nvidia” keylog_\n\n\n-----\n\n**USB Module**\n\nIf either the updatu or usbwrm commands are issued, a USB drive module may be downloaded and set to execute\non next startup. In the payload that we analyzed, the purpose only appears to search for potentially interesting files in\nremovable storage and copy them to the local disk, likely so they may be exfiltrated at a later time. This payload may\nbe configured with a set of file extensions (Fig 30) that are used to search for matching files on any USB drives. If any\nfiles are found, they are copied to a configured directory on the local disk while a running list of copied files are stored\nin a separate log so duplicate files are not copied. The anti-duplication method, however, only utilizes filenames so in\nthe event that an already copied file is later modified, a newer copy will not be saved for exflitration. Despite one of the\ncommands that may be used to download this payload may indicate this payload to contain “worm” functionality, that\ndoes not appear to be the case.\n\n**remvUser**\n\nDuring our research, we were not able to locate this module; so we are not sure what its functionality is. A best guess is\nthat it could be a clean-up/implant removal utility.\n\n**Python/Peppy**\n\nPeppy is a Python-based RAT with the majority of its appearances having similarities or definite overlap with MSIL/\nCrimson appearances. Peppy communicates to its C&C over HTTP and utilizes SQLite for much of its internal\nfunctionality and tracking of exfiltrated files. The primary purpose of Peppy may be the automated exfiltration of\npotentially interesting files and keylogs. Once Peppy successfully communicates to its C&C, the keylogging and\nexfiltration of files using configurable search parameters begins (Fig. 30). Files are exfiltrated using HTTP POST requests\n(Fig. 31).\n\n_Figure 30: Peppy configurable search parameters_\n\n_Figure 31: Peppy exfiltrating files_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to keylogging and the exfiltration of files, Peppy is also capable of accepting commands from its C&C to\nupdate itself, disable itself, exfiltrate a specific file, uninstall itself, execute a shell command, take screenshots, spawn a\nreverse shell, and download a remote file and execute it.\n\nIn addition, we have discovered a simple Python-based downloader (md5: 82719f0f6237d3efb9dd67d95f842013) that\nwas possibly written by the author(s) of Peppy based on code overlap between the downloader’s functionality and\nPeppy’s download_exec routine (Fig. 32, 33).\n\n_Figure 32: Python downloader code_\n\n_Figure 33: Peppy download_exec routine and MyURLOpener class_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs we described, there are clearly a number of common threads throughout these attacks. We have been able to\nconnect campaigns, vectors, payloads, and, in some cases, infrastructure, but additional details continue to emerge.\nIn the short term, this serves as an important reminder that wars are no longer waged solely on the ground or in the\nair. Rather, threat actors (whether from nation-states or private parties with interests in international conflicts) will use a\nvariety of cyber tools to achieve their goals.\n\n\n-----\n\n###
