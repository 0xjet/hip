The source code is for various internal Microsoft projects, including for\nBing, Cortana, and Bing Maps.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Leaked source code projects**\nIn a new blog post published tonight, Microsoft has confirmed that one of their employee's\naccounts was compromised by Lapsus$, providing limited access to source code\nrepositories.\n\n\"No customer code or data was involved in the observed activities. Our investigation has\nfound a single account had been compromised, granting limited access. Our cybersecurity\nresponse teams quickly engaged to remediate the compromised account and prevent\nfurther activity,\" explained Microsoft in an advisory about the Lapsus$ threat actors.\n\n\"Microsoft does not rely on the secrecy of code as a security measure and viewing source\ncode does not lead to elevation of risk. The tactics DEV-0537 used in this intrusion reflect\nthe tactics and techniques discussed in this blog.\"\n\n\"Our team was already investigating the compromised account based on threat intelligence\nwhen the actor publicly disclosed their intrusion. This public disclosure escalated our action\nallowing our team to intervene and interrupt the actor mid-operation, limiting broader\nimpact.\"\n\nWhile Microsoft has not shared how the account was compromised, they provided a general\noverview of the Lapsus gang's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed across\nmultiple attacks.\n\n## Focusing on compromised credentials\n\nMicrosoft is tracking the Lapsus$ data extortion group as 'DEV-0537' and says they\nprimarily focus on obtaining compromised credentials for initial access to corporate\nnetworks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese credentials are obtained using the following methods:\n\nDeploying the malicious Redline password stealer to obtain passwords and session\ntokens\nPurchasing credentials and session tokens on criminal underground forums\nPaying employees at targeted organizations (or suppliers/business partners) for\naccess to credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) approval\nSearching public code repositories for exposed credentials\n\n[Redline password stealer has become the malware of choice for stealing credentials and is](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/redline-malware-shows-why-passwords-shouldnt-be-saved-in-browsers/)\ncommonly distributed through phishing emails, watering holes, warez sites, and YouTube\nvideos.\n\nOnce Laspsus$ gains access to compromised credentials, they use it to log in to a\ncompany's public-facing devices and systems, including VPNs, Virtual Desktop\ninfrastructure, or identity management services, such as Okta, which they breached in\nJanuary.\n\nMicrosoft says they use session replay attacks for accounts that utilize MFA, or\ncontinuously trigger MFA notifications until the user becomes tired of them and confirms\nthat the user should be allowed to log in.\n\nMicrosoft says that in at least one attack, Lapsus$ performed a SIM swap attack to gain\ncontrol of the user's phone numbers and SMS texts to gain access to MFA codes needed to\nlog in to an account.\n\n[Once they gain access to a network, the threat actors use AD Explorer to find accounts with](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer)\nhigher privileges and then target development and collaboration platforms, such as\nSharePoint, Confluence, JIRA, Slack, and Microsoft Teams, where other credentials are\nstolen.\n\nThe hacking group also uses these credentials to gain access to source code repositories\non GitLab, GitHub, and Azure DevOps, as we saw with the attack on Microsoft.\n\n\"DEV-0537 is also known to exploit vulnerabilities in Confluence, JIRA, and GitLab for\nprivilege escalation,\" Microsoft explains in their report.\n\n\"The group compromised the servers running these applications to get the credentials of a\nprivileged account or run in the context of the said account and dump credentials from\nthere.\"\n\nThe threat actors will then harvest valuable data and exfiltrate it over NordVPN connections\nto hide their locations while performing destructive attacks on the victims' infrastructure to\ntrigger incident response procedures.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors then monitor these procedures through the victim s Slack or Microsoft\nTeams channels.\n\n## Protecting against Lapsus$\n\nMicrosoft recommends that corporate entities perform the following steps to protect against\nthreat actors like Lapsus$:\n\nStrengthen MFA implementation\nRequire Healthy and Trusted Endpoints\nLeverage modern authentication options for VPNs\nStrengthen and monitor your cloud security posture\nImprove awareness of social engineering attacks\nEstablish operational security processes in response to DEV-0537 intrusions\n\nLapsus$ has recently conducted numerous attacks against the enterprise, including those\nagainst
