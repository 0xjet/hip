Cybercriminals use\nunderground forums on the Dark Web to operate anonymously thereby not only posing a\nmajor threat to organizations and users alike but also equally to make it difficult to trace\nthem. In this blog, we will be getting into the nuances of “Matiex”, a Keylogger which is\nbeing sold in the underground forums for the buyers to use it for their own advantage.\n\n_Figure 1: Matiex Keylogger in underground forums_\nApart from recording everything typed on the keyboard and recovering passwords like any\nother Keylogger, Matiex also has other features like 4 Delivery, Unicode keystroke, Startup\n& Installation, +60 Password Recoveries, Self Destruction & Remote, Multi Binder and\nmore as shown in Figure 2, making it different from the other Keyloggers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Matiex features_\nLet’s look into few of the features mentioned above\n\n**4 Delivery**\n\nThe Keylogger offers 4 delivery methods – FTP, SMTP, Telegram or Discord, using which\nthe logged data can be retrieved by the threat actors.\n\n**Unicode keystroke**\n\nUnlike ASCII which represents English characters, Unicodes are meant to support\ncharacters from different languages around the world. The Matiex Keylogger supports\nUnicode characters which makes it possible to record keystrokes that include characters\nfrom other languages.\n\n**Self Destruction & Remote**\n\nAnother very important feature is Self Destruction & Remote. Keylogger has capabilities to\nupload information to a remote server from which confidential data can be retrieved\nanytime. Once the job is done and the threat actor’s goal is accomplished, the Keylogger\ncan automatically uninstall itself with no clue left behind and the users will have no idea\nthat their system has actually been monitored by a Keylogger.\n\n\n-----\n\n**+60 Password Recoveries**\n\nThis feature helps to recover confidential information like passwords and other sensitive\ninformation from more than 60 browsers that are supported as given in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3: Browsers from which credentials are recovered_\n**Startup & Installation**\n\nAuthors give threat actors the freedom to choose the installation process and startup. In\nother words, this is where this Keylogger can be customized for the convenience of each\nthreat actor using it.\n\n**Multi Binder**\n\nWith this feature, the threat actor has the ability to bind Matiex Keylogger with multiple files\nso that the Keylogger will run every time those files are opened without the user being\naware of its presence. In this way this Keylogger can monitor the system for multiple\ndocuments.\n\nAuthors of the Keylogger also have their own Terms of service (TOS) and packages that\nprovide limited voucher copies as shown in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4: TOS and Limited Voucher Copies_\nThey allow their buyers, “threat actors”, to contact them through Skype with the contact\ndetails given below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Skype Contact Details_\n\n**Delivery**\n\nOn further analysis, we found that the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) were mostly .NET\nfiles. The mode of delivery is through spam emails where users will be easily tricked to\nopen the attachment which delivers the payload. Now let’s reverse a .NET file which was\nextracted from a legitimate looking zip file “window-defender-update.zip” with dnSpy to\nsee some of the prominent features that this Matiex Keylogger promises to offer which\nattracts the threat actors towards it.\n\nThe people involved in distributing this malware have included the “MATIEX” string in it as\nshown in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6: Matiex string_\n**KeyboardLoggerTimer**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: KeyboardLoggerTimer feature_\nThis KeyboardLoggerTimer is the basic feature that all the Keyloggers have. This is used\nby the malware to record any interaction with the keyboard without the victim’s knowledge.\n\n**ScreenshotLoggerTimer**\n\n_Figure 8: ScreenshotLoggerTimer feature_\nAnother important feature is the ScreenshotLoggerTimer which can take screenshots of\nyour system automatically at specified time intervals. The screenshots are stored as low\nresolution images so that they consume less storage at rest and less bandwidth during\ntransmission. In Matiex Keylogger, the frequency of screenshots can be adjusted by the\nattacker to one photo per minute or a time interval more than that.\n\n**ClipboardLoggerTimer**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: ClipboardLoggerTimer feature_\nThe Clipboard is a buffer which is used to store any changes made during a cut, copy and\npaste operation in the system. The ClipboardLoggerTimer in Matiex Keylogger is one of\nthe key features as important pieces of information such as complex login credentials are\ncopied and pasted in registration forms, login pages and using this feature confidential\ninformation can be retrieved from the victim’s system.\n\n**VoiceRecordLogger**\n\n_Figure 10: VoiceRecordLogger feature_\n_VoiceRecordLogger is another very important feature of Matiex Keylogger as it can record_\nconversations via the computer’s microphone.\n\n**ThePSWDSenders**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11: ThePSWDSenders feature_\nKeyloggers will usually save information like username, passwords, bank credentials,\napplications opened and websites visited. All these data will be encrypted and uploaded to\nthe remote, attacker controlled servers via FTP, HTTP or Email. ThePSWDSenders feature\nis used to send all this information to the threat actors.\n\n**AddToStartup**\n\n_Figure 12: AddToStartup feature_\nThis Keylogger also has the feature of adding itself to the Windows Startup to maintain\npersistence and keep doing its job even after reboot. This is done using the AddToStartup\nfeature.\n\n**telegramsender**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: telegramsender feature_\nThis Keylogger has another feature of stealing information through Telegram. Telegram\nbeing a popular chat application, threat actors can use its legitimacy to steal information\nwith ease.\n\n**IPLogger**\n\n_Figure 14: IPLogger feature_\nUsing the IPLogger feature, the threat actors obtain the victim’s IP.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMatiex Keylogger is being sold in the underground forums, due to their gained popularity,\nand can also be used as MaaS (Malware-as-a-service) because of their ease of use,\ncompetitive pricing and immediate response from support We at K7 Labs keep monitoring\n\n\n-----\n\nunderground forums as well and give early detection to protect customers from being\nvictims to the attackers.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**\n\n**Hash** **Filename** **K7 Detection**\n**Name**\n\n\n5521B99B3FDDFD85D4E3DEECD76CA528(file\nanalyzed)\n\n\nQ.exe Spyware (\n004bf6371 )\n\n\n376944ae1de8e4181797668fb81022da window-defenderupdate.zip\n\n\nSpyware (\n004bf6371 )\n\n\n6186934D6EBCBD2761413698113233CF iOpEx.exe Trojan (\n0056ae001 )\n\nBD6F2EF0D491D749705CFE12CD8BABE6 BwJzCRNDwH.exe Trojan (\n0056af741 )\n\n\n-----",
