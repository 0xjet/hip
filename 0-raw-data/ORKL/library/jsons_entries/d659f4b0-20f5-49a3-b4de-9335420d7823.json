After their 2020 emergence, they’ve\naccumulated at least 700 victims, where by “victims” we mean ‘big fish’ corporations with\nmillions of dollars in revenue; unlike your average neighborhood ransomware operation,\nConti never cared for extorting your mother-in-law for her vacation photos. For a while, Conti\nwas the face of ransomware, along with fellow gang REvil – until this February, when 14\nREvil operatives were arrested by the Russian authorities, leaving Conti effectively alone in\nits position as a major league ransomware operation. At the time, this was cautiously hailed\nas a sign of goodwill on Russia’s part; some figured that possibly the Russians would finally\nrefuse to tolerate the incessant and irreverent attacks originating on Russian soil and\ntargeted at western corporate offices, schools and hospitals. Now, a month later and two\nweeks into the full-blown war between Russia and Ukraine, this utopian vision does not\nseem so likely.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn February 25th, 2022, Conti released a statement of full support for the Russian\ngovernment — coupled with a stern warning addressed at anyone who might consider\nretaliating against Russia via digital warfare.\n\n_Figure 1 – Initial announcement of Conti group supporting Russia_\n\nA few hours later, someone high up the chain at Conti must have realized that this statement\nmight possibly backfire, and it was modified to read as follows:\n\n_Figure 2 – Modified announcement of Conti group supporting Russia_\n\nAs per Dr. Maya Angelou’s famous quote, “When someone shows you who they are, believe\nthem the first time”. A lot of people were angry, and didn’t care for the clarification. To Conti’s\ndismay, one of these people had the means to meaningfully act on their anger.\n\nStarting February 27, a new Twitter account appeared by the name of “ContiLeaks”, and\nstarted doing unto Conti as they often did unto corporations who won’t pay up. Allegedly a\nUkrainian security researcher, ContiLeaks published a huge log containing hundreds of\nthousands of Jabber and Rocket.Chat messages that Conti had used for internal\ncommunication. This led to a veritable gold rush of researchers diving into the huge pile of\nmessages and sharing their summaries, findings and observations; we’d be remiss not to\nmention [the in-depth series of blog posts published by Brian Krebs, who read the entire leak](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)\nand distilled it into a list of takeaways – a sacrifice that must not be taken for granted.\n\nWe say that because the data-set in question is simply maddening to wade through. First of\nall, as noted above, it is huge. Once you get past that, there are many other problems. Some\nof the messages are missing. Some of the messages are unclear. Some of the messages\n\n\n-----\n\nwere encrypted with OTR (Off-the-Record Messaging). Some of the messages contain\nRussian slang that does not survive automatic translation — such as the below conversation\nwhich was, originally, about email address blacklisting evasion:\n\n_Figure 3 – Example of how tricky is Russian slang for automated translation tools_\n\nThat first message feels like it should lead to a punchline a la “my dog has no nose”, but all it\nleads to is frustration and sadness on the part of the analyst reading it – as do many other\nsimilar messages. Still, with all the above said, these messages offer an unprecedented\ninsight into the operations of the Conti Corporation. And it is a corporation, for all intents and\npurposes; there’s an HR department, a hiring process, offline office premises, salaries and\nbonus payments. If it weren’t for the looming threat of prison, you could mistake Conti for a\nnormal tech startup. In this article, we delve into the inner workings of the surprisingly\nstartup-like Conti group.\n\n## Teams and responsibilities\n\nConti’s structure is almost a classic organizational hierarchy, with team leaders who report to\nupper management, but to their credit there are many instances of different groups working\nwith each other directly (this is called “horizontal information flow”, and is a Good Thing and\na sign of organizational health, as any steeple-handed thinkfluencer will happily tell you).\n\nTo give an overview of how the communications between the members and affiliates work,\nwe tagged most of the active members from Jabber chat with their professional occupations\nand visualized their communications. In this graph, the more saturated the link between the\nmembers indicates more intensive communication, thus showing both vertical linkage\nbetween the bosses and subordinates, and horizontal linkage between the members actively\nworking on shared projects. This however is by no means a perfect representation of the\norganizational structure, as people are being replaced and promoted all the time.\n\n**Graph tips & notes:**\n\nDrag a user node to see their connections and the amount of messages they sent to\nother users.\n\n\n-----\n\nHover over the legend s colors, to see the cluster of people with similar roles within the\norganization.\nUsers who had less than 10 incoming and outgoing messages were filtered out of the\ngraph.\nDue to the usage of encryption services, some conversations are missing messages.\n\n[Open Full Screen](https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/map_index_v2.html)\n\nThe main groups we observed were:\n\n**HR – Responsible for making new hires. This includes combing through Russian-**\nspeaking job searching sites, organizing online interviews, and mediating between the\ninterviewer and the relevant technical focal point. In many cases, HR did not have the\nauthority to decide on compensation; if an interview went well, the candidate would be\nreferred to higher management who would make them an offer.\n\n**Coders – The** [celebrated folk who maintain the nuts and bolts of the actual malware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs)\ncode, the server back-ends, and admin web panels required by the Conti group’s dayto-day operations. This extends to many auxiliary tools used by the Conti group\nincluding TrickBot, Bazaar, Anchor, the C&C infrastructure and, of course, the “lockers”\nthemselves that encrypt the files of unfortunate victims.\n\n**Testers – Check various malware against known security solutions to make sure that**\nthey avoid detection. Understandably, security vendors aren’t thrilled to sell their\nproducts to the Conti group — in at least one case a third party had to get involved,\nand make the purchase on Conti’s behalf (while collecting a hefty premium), and we\nimagine this was a normal occurrence.\n\n**Crypters – “Crypting” is cybercrime slang for what some of us more academic types**\ncall “obfuscation”. Crypters are tasked with making syntactic changes to payloads,\nbinaries and scripts to make them more difficult to detect and analyze while preserving\ntheir semantic function. Crypters would often work closely with testers; crypter\nstrategies could look good in theory, but the real test was when a tester would throw\nthem against a hostile sandbox.\n\n**SysAdmins – Conti members tasked with setting up the attack infrastructure and**\nproviding support as necessary. This includes all tasks dealt with by a typical IT\ndepartment — installing panels, maintaining servers, erecting proxies, registering\ndomains, managing accounts, and presumably telling other Conti members to try\nturning off their machines and turning them back on again.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Reverse Engineers – Look at existing tools in order to understand how they work. For**\ninstance, while the Conti locker was being built during mid-2020, its development was\nsupported by a reverse-engineering effort of the Maze ransomware, which was being\nused at the time by some of Conti’s affiliates. Another example is a project reversing\nthe Buer loader in order to launch a similar project inside the Conti ecosystem.\n\n**Offensive Team – Given initial access to a victim machine, these Conti members**\n(called “hackers” and “pentesters” in communications) are responsible for privilege\nescalation and lateral movement, converting an initial breach into a full capture of the\ntargeted network. Their ultimate goal would be to obtain domain administrator\nprivileges, which would then allow exfiltrating and encrypting the victim data.\n\n**OSINT Specialists and Negotiation Staff – Once a victim’s data is successfully held**\nfor ransom, these Conti members step in to make demands and attempt to secure a\ndeal. Some are OSINT specialists, conducting research on the targeted company —\nthe sector it operates in, its annual revenue, and so on, in order for the ransom\npayment demand to strike a balance between lucrative and realistic. Other members\ndo the actual negotiation, and act as “customer service representatives” operating\nConti’s Tor-based chat. Handling “customers” would often entail coaxing, making\nthreats, or providing proof that Conti possesses the exfiltrated data and can recover it\nfor the victim or publish it, depending on whether the victim pays. Management of the\nConti leaks blog, and scheduling publication of victim data in case the deadline for\nransom payment is not met, also falls under this department’s purview.\n\nFrom the graph we can also identify the main people in the organization playing the key role\nin the group’s communications:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – Key members and their communications based on the leaked messages_\n\n**Stern is the Big Boss, well-known as a leader of the group both internally and outside**\nthe organization. He’s the one developing the high-level vision of the group’s\noperations and collaborations with affiliates, and manages many of the people and\nprojects directly and indirectly. Stern also directly pays salaries to multiple members of\nthe organization and manages most of the expenses. Depending on time, Stern’s\nmanagement style fluctuates widely between micromanagement with sending\nbroadcast messages asking about their tasks and problems and multi-day absences.\n**Bentley is a technical lead of the group responsible for testing and evasion of malware**\nand payloads used by multiple groups inside and outside the organization. Bentley\nmanages teams of crypters and testers, working with many different internal and\nexternal customers, as well as handles the questions related to digital certificates, thirdparty anti-virus solutions.\n**Mango is the “manager of general questions of the team”, solving mostly the questions**\nbetween the people who are responsible for infection campaigns and the coders.\nMango also takes part in the HR process and directly pays salary to part of the task\nforce, as well as effectively assisting Stern with his other projects.\n**Buza is a technical manager responsible for coders and their products, curating**\nloaders and bots development within multiple coders teams.\n**Target is a manager responsible for the hackers’ teams, their intercommunication and**\nworkload. He also manages all the aspects of all offline offices, both for hackers and\noperators, their budgeting, HR and effective communication with other parts of the\norganization. He also manages part of the tasks related to social engineering\ncampaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Veron aka mors is the focal point of the group s operations with Emotet. Veron is**\nmanaging all the aspects of Emotet campaigns, including their infrastructure, closely\nwith relevant Conti members.\n\n## Hiring process\n\nWe’ve all heard of the skill shortage in tech, and the Conti group has to deal with it just like\neveryone else. To improve their odds, they opted to diversify their initial candidate pool;\ninstead of solely relying on criminal underground talent, Conti regularly recruits staff by\nabusing legitimate recruitment websites.\n\n### Recruitment Sites\n\nThe main resource typically used by Conti HR for hiring is Russian-speaking headhunting\nservices such as [headhunter.ru. They’ve also used other sites such as superjobs.ru, but](https://headhunter.ru/)\nreportedly with less success. Conti OPSec forbids leaving traces of developer job openings\non such websites, a regulation stringently enforced by one of the higher-ups, Stern; and so\n[for hiring developers, Conti bypasses the headhunter.ru job system, instead directly](https://headhunter.ru/)\naccessing the CV pool and contacting candidates by email. You might wonder “why does\n[headhunter.ru offer such a service?”, and the answer is, they don’t. Conti simply bought the](https://headhunter.ru/)\nsoftware which provide access to the “borrowed” CV pool without permission, which seems\nto be standard practice in the cybercrime world.\n\n_Figure 5 – Access to headhunter.ru resume database through third-party tools for the_\n_recruitment purposes_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis need to directly interface with a huge list of CVs instead of using the site s built-in\nfiltering further exacerbates the typical HR struggle to find candidates with the relevant tech\nexpertise. At times, Conti HR has expressed downright frustration at being swamped with\nirrelevant candidates:\n\n_Figure 6 – Challenges in finding talents for Conti Corporation_\n\nOnce HR does locate a candidate who might fit some vacancy inside Conti Corp, their CV is\nanonymized and sent to the relevant technical point of contact inside the organization. This\nbegins a cumbersome dialogue where HR acts as a mediator, to make sure that the\ncandidate’s prospective superior does not learn their identity. Needless to say, this process is\nnot bulletproof. Sometimes it’s possible to deduce the candidate’s identity by running a web\nsearch for their job experience, and sometimes HR would just make a mistake and fail to\nexpunge the name.\n\n_Figure 7 – CV of one of the candidates passed from HR to the hiring manager_\n\nOne might be surprised by the demographic make-up of Conti employees. Contrary to the\nprevailing stereotype of young and reckless cybercriminals, who have an illusion of\ninvincibility and nothing to lose, Conti was also approached by prospective senior\nemployees. One such person, who claimed to have developer experience going back to\n1980, introduces himself as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 – Old school developer working for the group_\n\nThe use of HeadHunter as a recruiting tool is not limited to technical specialists. It was also\nused for recruiting other employees, e.g. dispatchers for call centers used in social\n[engineering campaigns such as BazaarCall. Interviewing these candidates is the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bazarcall-malware-uses-malicious-call-centers-to-infect-victims/)\nresponsibility of “Derek”, a Conti HR employee, who’d use Telegram instead of tor-based\nchats for this task.\n\n### Word of Mouth\n\nWhen communicating with employees, higher management would often make the case that\nworking for Conti was the deal of a lifetime — high salaries, interesting tasks, career\ngrowth(!) — and employees should make an effort to pull in any highly-talented candidates\nthey know, so that they may also enjoy this paradise. “Stern”, one of the higher-ups, even\ncame up with an employee referral program for coders, where a successful referral that lasts\nmore than a month nets a bonus equal to the referred employee’s second salary.\n\n_Figure 9 – Refer-a-friend bonuses_\n\nIn one truly outstanding case, a curious ex-red teamer hacked the group’s Jabber in order to\nspeak to Stern directly. While in a typical tech company such a gambit might be frowned\nupon, in the cybercrime world it is evidently an equivalent of the mythical Firm Handshake:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10 – Ex-red teamer hacked the group’s Jabber to get the job later_\n\n### Darknet Forums\n\nApart from these unorthodox methods, Conti also recruits talent in the more traditional way,\nthrough underground forums. Prospective candidates are first given the jabber handle that\ntheir interviewer will use (such as admintest, which would handle tests for sysadmins). If the\ninterview was successful, a permanent account for the candidate is created. Even with this\nroutine method, Conti HR would sometimes get creative: for example, when searching for\noffensive team members and sysadmins, they came up with the idea of “recycling” an older\nrecruitment drive by a rival ransomware group. Their chief competitor, REvil, had earlier\npulled a publicity stunt and deposited a million dollars in bitcoin into an account, then posted\na recruitment ad in the midst of the very active forum thread discussing the deposit. This ad\nreceived many responses with contact details, all public, and so Conti HR could extract from\nthis thread a pool of high-quality candidates to spam with job offers.\n\n_Figure 11 – Borrowing talents from REvil group thread on the dark forum_\n\n## Compensation and Performance\n\nMembers of Conti’s negotiating team (including OSINT specialists) are paid by commissions,\ncalculated as a percentage of the paid ransom amount that ranges from 0.5% to 1%. Coders\nand some of the managers are paid a salary in bitcoin, transferred once or twice a month.\n\n\n-----\n\nConti employees are not protected by their local labor boards, and so have to endure some\npractices that typical tech employees are exempt from, such as being fined for\nunderperforming:\n\n_Figure 12 – Fines for underperformance_\n\nWhile fines are mostly used as an established tool in the coder department, they are\nsporadically employed on manager whims in other departments — for example, in IT and\nDevOps, where one person responsible for depositing money was fined $100 for a missed\npayment:\n\n_Figure 13 – Fines for technical mistakes_\n\nUltimately, this method proved not effective enough, and Conti management had to resort to\nthe more traditional threat of termination in order to motivate employees, as seen below.\n\n_Figure 14 – Termination for non-motivated employees_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Offensive team gets less flexibility in its time off as well. After all, a team member being\navailable or not can spell the difference between a breach being detected and neutralized,\nand it being successfully advanced to the stage where victim data is encrypted and\nexfiltrated. For members of this team, who are used to being constantly on call, a simple\npleasure such as having Saturday and Sunday off is cause for celebration:\n\n_Figure 15 – No work-home balance for some of Conti employees_\n\nOther than these strokes of good fortune, the offensive team cannot catch a break. Even on\nthe New Year, which is widely celebrated in all Russian-speaking countries and usually\nentails several days of employee vacation, members of this team are expected to jump into\ntheir “combat roles” if need be. Other employees are also technically on call during these\ndays, but it is strongly implied that they are on paid vacation in practice, and will not be\ngetting bosses’ surprise inspection texts during the holiday.\n\n_Figure 16 – Conti employees are entitled to be available for work even during the New Year_\n_holidays_\n\nAs seen in Silver’s message further above, there is an “employee of the month” award that\ndraws from the fund of punitive fines levied on that month’s less favored employees. The\naward bonus is equal to 50% of that employee’s salary, and may be given to employees for\n\n\n-----\n\nuseful new initiatives that score points with management (such as inventing a new payload\ndelivery method) or for extraordinary commitment and persistence while solving some\nspecific issue.\n\n_Figure 17 – Employee of the month competition_\n\nManagement evidently takes the award very seriously — the reasons for picking the winner\nare not made up, and the above-mentioned points do matter.\n\n_Figure 18 – How the managers chose the employee of the month_\n\nManagement style varies from team to team. In some cases, the “big boss” Stern just sends\na broadcast message asking the group how they are, what projects they are working on and\nwhether they have any new ideas they want to advance. In other cases, middle management\nis involved and typically demands reports, most of which are unfortunately unavailable to us\nas they are transferred with OTR or via private sharing services such as privnote.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt times team leaders might even engage in the time-honored corporate tradition of the\nPerformance Review, discussing at the end of the year how the employee fared, what they\ndid right and how they can improve, as well as informing them about Conti’s global plans for\nnext year and recommending training opportunities.\n\n_Figure 19 – “Performance review” and official trainings for Conti employees_\n\n## Remote and Anonymous Work\n\nNot all Conti employees know that they are part of criminal activity — at least not right from\nthe start. In one online job interview, a manager tells a potential hire for the coding team:\n“everything is anonymous here, the main direction of the company is software for\npentesters”.\n\nOne striking example is a group member known by the moniker “Zulas”, most likely the\nperson who developed Trickbot’s backend in the Erlang programming language. Zulas is\nvery passionate about Erlang, eager to show examples of his other work, and even mentions\n\n\n-----\n\nhis real name. When his manager mentions that his trick (Trickbot) project was seen by\n“half of the world”, Zulas does not understand the reference, calls the system “lero” and\nreveals that he has no idea what his software is doing and why the team goes to such\nlengths to protect member identities. His interlocutor decides not to break his naive heart,\nand tells him that he is working on a backend for an ad analytics system.\n\n_Figure 20 – Trickbot backend developer allegedly doesn’t know what he develops_\n\nEven when an unwitting employee finally realizes what they are building, Conti has a plan to\nretain them. Stern himself briefly describes the process in another conversation: the coder\nmight work on just one module, without understanding the project as a whole; when they\nfinally realize, after many hours of work, Conti offers them a pay raise. Stern testifies that by\nthat point, employees typically figure that since everything has gone smoothly so far, they\ndon’t have to worry about consequences, and therefore the only incentive to go through the\nhassle of quitting their job is purely moral considerations. Stern seems to imply that this\n\n\n-----\n\nmethod yields good retention rates, even for employees who would otherwise have balked at\nbeing recruited to work for a cybercrime syndicate in the first place. If you ask us, this ranks\nright up there with Asch’s and Milgram’s experiments as a depressing empirical result in\nsocial psychology.\n\n_Figure 21 – What Conti developers know about what they are doing?_\n\n### At Conti, We Work Hard and Play Hard\n\nIt seems that many of the long-term employees developed relationships that extend further\nthan just anonymous communication via work chat. For example, some employees are\ncomfortable with lending other members money if they are stuck in another city and forgot\ntheir ledger. Some members even have face to face meetings, getting together and drinking\nwine with their families:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 22 – Relationship between some Conti employees_\n\nAn inherent part of belonging to a crime group, and a natural conversation subject between\ncolleagues, is the job risk. Attitude to this subject varies greatly between employees: some\ndisregard the risk and see mainly the benefits, going so far as to romanticize their job (“only\nhere I realized the dreams can come true”), and others express fear and even outright\nconfess that they want out.\n\n_Figure 23 – The realization of what the group is doing_\n\n## Offline Offices\n\nYou’d imagine an enterprise like Conti would be hosted entirely online, but no: the Conti\ngroup holds several physical offices. These are curated by “Target”, Stern’s partner and\neffective head of office operations, who is also responsible for the wage fund, office technical\nequipment, the Conti hiring process and personnel training. During 2020, offline offices were\nmainly used by testers, offensive teams and negotiators; Target mentions 2 offices dedicated\nto operators who are speaking directly with victim representatives. In August 2020, an\nadditional office was opened for sysadmins and programmers, under the purview of\n“Professor, who is responsible for the whole technical process of securing a victim infection\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 24 – Expenses in Conti Corporation_\n\nThe leaked Rocket.Chat messages include the communications of the offensive team\nmembers who worked at the office, indicating that the Rocket.Chat was likely installed on\ntheir mobile devices.\n\n_Figure 25 – Office day to day of Conti Corporation_\n\n## Future Development Plans\n\n\n-----\n\nConti higher management constantly seeks new ways to expand the business. The ideas\nfloated for this purpose range from simple scams to full-scale side projects. One of the ideas\ndiscussed was creating a crypto exchange in the group’s own ecosystem:\n\n_Figure 26 – “Crypto System” plans by Conti group_\n\nMango seems to enthusiastically support all the boss’s ideas and promotes them among\nother members of the group:\n\n_Figure 27 – Internal promotion for the new crypto business ideas_\n\nAnother project is the “darknet social network” (also: “VK for darknet” or “Carbon Black for\nhackers”), a project inspired by Stern and carried out by Mango, planned to be developed as\na commercial project. In July 2021 Conti was already in contact with a designer, who\nproduced a few mockups.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 28 – Design mockups for the new darknet social network_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Aftermath of the Leak\n\nBecause the leak kept going after the initial dump of leaked data, we all got the unusual\nprivilege of seeing responses to the original leak. Members were seen wiping past activity,\nremoving production VMs and moving to other communication channels.\n\n_Figure 29 – Cleaning the production VMs after the leak_\n\nIt seems the leak added to the pile of current problems in Conti. As we saw in the chats, the\nbig boss Stern went silent around mid-January, in January-February there we’ve observed\nmultiple reported issues with the salary, and eventually, a few days before the leak Frances\nin Rocket.Chat tells everyone to take a break for 2-3 months to regroup and reorganize due\nto wide public attention and the absence of group’s bosses.\n\n_Figure 30 – Notification in Rocket.Chat regarding the suspension of operations_\n\nWhile all this is going on, the Conti business remains operational, at least partially. The Conti\nleak site (ContiNews) is still up and keeps being updated with new victims. As the process of\nthe setup and support of Conti infrastructure is streamlined, it won’t be too much of a\nproblem for Conti to set up its operations from scratch.\n\nAs for members, Conti will in all likelihood lose a few. Certainly, those members who were\ndoxxed as a result of the leak are expected to at least take a long vacation. Probably several\nmore employees who were offended by the way other members talked about them behind\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir backs will leave, as well as those who were already uneasy about the potential\noccupational hazards of working for a ransomware operation; this ongoing leak no doubt\nspooked them.\n\nHaving said all that, with all the knowledge, effort, organization, ingenuity and money poured\nin, Conti is simply Too Big To Fail. Barring a wide-sweeping arrest such as the fate that befell\nREVil, Conti will in all likelihood rise again. If any of us had romantic delusions about a\nhugely profitable operation such as Conti being run by a small, clueless, passionate group\nthat’s just “winging it” and might get tired of rolling in all this money, we all know better now.\n\n\n-----",
