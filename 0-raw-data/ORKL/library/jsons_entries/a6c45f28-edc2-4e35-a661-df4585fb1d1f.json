Ransomware\nmalware such as Reveton, Urausy, Tobfy, and Kovter has cost consumers considerable time and money\nover the past several years. Ransomware prevents victims from using their computer normally (e.g., by\nlocking the screen) and uses social engineering to convince victims that failing to follow the malware\nauthors' instructions will lead to real-world consequences. These consequences, such as owing a fine or\nfacing arrest and prosecution, are presented as being the result of a fabricated indiscretion like pirating\nmusic or downloading illegal pornography. Victims of these traditional forms of ransomware could ignore\nthe demands and use security software to unlock the system and remove the offending malware.\nCryptoLocker changes this dynamic by aggressively encrypting files on the victim's system and returning\ncontrol of the files to the victim only after the ransom is paid.\n\n## Infection vector\n\nThe earliest CryptoLocker samples appear to have been released on the Internet on September 5, 2013.\nDetails about this initial distribution phase are unclear, but it appears the samples were downloaded\nfrom a compromised website located in the United States, either by a version of CryptoLocker that has\nnot been analyzed as of this publication, or by a custom downloader created by the same authors.\n\nEarly versions of CryptoLocker were distributed through spam emails targeting business professionals\n(as opposed to home Internet users). The lure was often a \"consumer complaint\" against the email\nrecipient or their organization. Attached to these emails was a ZIP archive with a random alphabetical\nfilename containing 13 to 17 characters. Only the first character of the filename is capitalized. The\narchive contained a single executable with the same filename as the ZIP archive but with an EXE\nextension. Table 1 lists several examples observed by CTU researchers.\n\n**Compressed archive** **Included executable file**\n\nJcgnbunudberrr.zip Jcgnbunudberrr.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nLmpjxmvheortt.zip Lmpjxmvheortt.exe\n\nIcmcobxksjghdlnnt.zip Icmcobxksjghdlnnt.exe\n\nGfaiqhgtqakbxlbf.zip Gfaiqhgtqakbxlbf.exe\n\n_Table 1. Filenames of email-delivered malware samples._\n\nOn October 7, 2013, CTU researchers observed CryptoLocker being distributed by the peer-to-peer\n(P2P) Gameover Zeus malware in a typical pay-per-installation arrangement. In this case, Gameover\nZeus was distributed by the Cutwail spam botnet using lures consistent with previous malware\ndistribution campaigns. Figure 1 shows a phishing email delivered by Cutwail on October 7, 2013.\nAttached to the message is a ZIP archive containing a small (approximately 20KB) executable using a\ndocument extension in the filename and displaying an Adobe Reader icon. This Upatre malware\ndownloads and executes Gameover Zeus, which in turn downloads and installs other malware families\nincluding CryptoLocker.\n\n_Figure 1. Spam email containing the Upatre downloader. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nAs of this publication, Gameover Zeus remains the primary method of distributing CryptoLocker. In\naddition to being distributed by Cutwail, Gameover Zeus has also been distributed by the Blackhole and\nMagnitude exploit kits.\n\n## Execution and persistence\n\nCryptoLocker hides its presence from victims until it has successfully contacted a command and control\n(C2) server and encrypted the files located on connected drives. Prior to these actions, the malware\nensures that it remains running on infected systems and that it persists across reboots. When first\nexecuted, the malware creates a copy of itself in either %AppData% or %LocalAppData%. CryptoLocker\nthen deletes the original executable file.\n\n\n-----\n\nCryptoLocker then creates an autorun registry key:\n```\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \"CryptoLocker\":<random>.exe \n\n```\nSome versions of CryptoLocker create an additional registry entry:\n```\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce \"*CryptoLocker\":<random>.exe \n\n```\nThe asterisk at the beginning of the key name ensures that the malware executes even if the system is\nrestarted in \"safe mode.\"\n\nAdditional configuration data is stored in the following registry key:\n```\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\CryptoLocker or HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\CryptoLocker_0388 \n\n```\nThe VersionInfo value stored within this key contains configuration data encoded with the XOR key\n0x819C33AE. The PublicKey value contains the RSA public key received from the C2 server during the\ninitial network connection.\n\nThe executable files in early CryptoLocker samples used a random filename formatted like a GUID:\n```\n{71257279-042B-371D-A1D3-FBF8D2FADFFA}.exe \n\n```\nHowever, the executable files in recent samples use the naming pattern shown in the second column of\nTable 1.\n\n## Network\n\nSeveral early versions of CryptoLocker, thought to be part of a beta testing phase, included code to\nconnect to 184.164.136.134. This IP address is located in a PhoenixNAP datacenter in Arizona, but it\n[was likely under the administrative control of Jolly Works Hosting. As of this publication, this IP address](http://blog.dynamoo.com/2013/07/jolly-works-hosting-is-it-really-jolly.html)\nis no longer active, and CryptoLocker samples released since mid-September no longer reference it.\n\nThe malware's network communications use an internal domain generation algorithm (DGA) that\nproduces 1,000 potential C2 domain addresses per day. The domain names contain 12 to 15\nalphabetical characters and are within one of seven possible top-level domains (TLDs): com, net, org,\ninfo, biz, ru, and co.uk. An error in the algorithm prevents it from using 'z' in a generated domain name.\nThe threat actors never registered a domain under the 'co.uk' TLD, and Nominet, the official registrar for\nthe 'uk' ccTLD, began to sinkhole all potential addresses under this domain on October 18, 2013. As a\nresult, the threat actors cannot use 'co.uk' domain names.\n\nThe threat actors have also used static C2 servers embedded inside the malware. On October 17, a\nsample was distributed that first connected to inworkforallthen . com before cycling through the domains\ncreated by the DGA. Several days later, another sample was hard-coded to connect to ovenbdjnihhdlb .\nnet prior to attempting other generated domains. Since that time, new samples frequently contain static\naddresses taken from the pool of domain names created by the DGA.\n\n\n-----\n\nCryptoLocker cycles indefinitely until it connects to a C2 server via HTTP. After connecting to an\nattacker-controlled C2 server, CryptoLocker sends a phone-home message encrypted with an RSA\npublic key embedded within the malware (see Figure 2). Only servers with the corresponding RSA\nprivate key can decrypt this message and successfully communicate with an infected system.\n\n_Figure 2. CryptoLocker's initial phone-home traffic. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nAnalysis of the IP addresses used by the threat actors reveals several patterns of behavior. The first is\nthat the threat actors use virtual private servers (VPS) located at different ISPs throughout the Russian\nFederation and in former Eastern bloc countries. The extended use of some of these hosts, such as\n93.189.44.187, 81.177.170.166, and 95.211.8.39, suggests that they are located at providers that are\nindifferent to criminal activity on their networks or are complicit in its execution (such as so-called\n\"bulletproof\" hosting providers). The remaining servers appear to be used for several days before\ndisappearing. The threat actors could be strategically using this pattern to remain a moving target, or\nsome ISPs could be terminating their service.\n\nA complete list of network indicators is included in the Threat indicators section.\n\n## Encryption\n\nInstead of using a custom cryptographic implementation like many other malware families, CryptoLocker\nuses strong third-party certified cryptography offered by Microsoft's [CryptoAPI. By using a sound](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptography-portal)\nimplementation and following best practices, the malware authors have created a robust program that is\ndifficult to circumvent. The malware uses the \"Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic\nProvider\" (MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV) to create keys and to encrypt data with the RSA\n(CALG_RSA_KEYX) and AES (CALG_AES_256) algorithms.\n\nThe encryption process begins after CryptoLocker has established its presence on the system and\nsuccessfully located, connected to, and communicated with an attacker-controlled C2 server. This\ncommunication provides the malware with the threat actors' RSA public key, which is used throughout\nthe encryption process.\n\nThe malware begins the encryption process by using the GetLogicalDrives() API call to enumerate the\ndisks on the system that have been assigned a drive letter (e.g., C:). In early CryptoLocker samples, the\nGetDriveType() API call then determines if the drives are local fixed disks or network drives\n(DRIVE_FIXED and DRIVE_REMOTE, respectively). Only those two types of drives are selected for file\nencryption in early samples. Samples since late September also select removable drives\n(DRIVE_REMOVABLE), which can include USB thumb drives and external hard disks.\n\nAfter selecting a list of disks to attack, the malware lists all files on those disks that match the 72 file\npatterns shown in Table 2. Over time, the threat actors adjusted which types of files are selected for\nencryption; for example, PDF files were not encrypted in very early samples but were added in midSeptember. As a result, the list in Table 2 is subject to change.\n\n\n-----\n\n*.odt *.ods *.odp *.odm *.odb *.doc *.docx *.docm\n\n*.wps *.xls *.xlsx *.xlsm *.xlsb *.xlk *.ppt *.pptx\n\n*.pptm *.mdb *.accdb *.pst *.dwg *.dxf *.dxg *.wpd\n\n*.rtf *.wb2 *.mdf *.dbf *.psd *.pdd *.eps *.ai\n\n*.indd *.cdr ????????.jpg ????????.jpe img_*.jpg *.dng *.3fr *.arw\n\n*.srf *.sr2 *.bay *.crw *.cr2 *.dcr *.kdc *.erf\n\n*.mef *.mrw *.nef *.nrw *.orf *.raf *.raw *.rwl\n\n*.rw2 *.r3d *.ptx *.pef *.srw *.x3f *.der *.cer\n\n*.crt *.pem *.pfx *.p12 *.p7b *.p7c *.pdf *.odc\n\n_Table 2. File patterns selected for encryption._\n\nEach file is encrypted with a unique AES key, which in turn is encrypted with the RSA public key\nreceived from the C2 server. The encrypted key, a small amount of metadata, and the encrypted file\ncontents are then written back to disk, replacing the original file. Encrypted files can only be recovered\nby obtaining the RSA private key held exclusively by the threat actors.\n\nAs a form of bookkeeping, the malware stores the location of every encrypted file in the Files subkey of\nthe HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\CryptoLocker (or CryptoLocker_0388) registry key (see Figure 3).\n\n_Figure 3. List of encrypted files stored by CryptoLocker. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nAfter finishing the file encryption process, CryptoLocker periodically rescans the system for new drives\nand files to encrypt.\n\nThe malware does not reveal its presence to the victim until all targeted files have been encrypted. The\nvictim is presented with a splash screen containing instructions and an ominous countdown timer (see\nFigure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Splashscreen presented to victims. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n## Payment\n\nThe ransom amount varied in very early samples (see Table 3), but settled at $300 USD or 2 BTC\n(Bitcoins) within the few weeks after CryptoLocker's introduction. Dramatic Bitcoin price inflation in the\nlatter months of 2013 prompted the threat actors to reduce the ransom to 1 BTC, 0.5 BTC, and then\nagain to 0.3 BTC, where it remains as of this publication.\n\nAmount Currency (abbreviation)\n\n100 U.S. Dollar (USD)\n\n100 Euro (EUR)\n\n100 Australian Dollar (AUD)\n\n200 Brazilian Real (BRL)\n\n100 Canadian Dollar (CAD)\n\n2000 Czech Koruna (CZK)\n\n1000 Danish Krone (DKK)\n\n\n-----\n\n100 British Pound Sterling (GBP)\n\n1000 Mexican Peso (MXN)\n\n1500 Norwegian Krone (NOK)\n\n200 New Zealand Dollar (NZD)\n\n500 Polish Zloty (PLN)\n\n200 Romanian Leu (RON)\n\n1500 Swedish Krona (SEK)\n\n_Table 3. Original ransom amounts in various denominations. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe threat actors have offered various payment methods to victims since the inception of CryptoLocker.\nThe methods are all anonymous or pseudo-anonymous, making it difficult to track the origin and final\ndestination of payments.\n\n## cashU\n\n_Figure 5. Payment options using the cashU service. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n\n-----\n\n[The description of cashU shown in Figure 5 is taken directly from the Wikipedia entry about the method:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CashU)\n\n_cashU is a prepaid online and mobile payment method available in the Middle East and North Africa, a_\n_region with a large and young population with very limited access to credit cards. Because of this, cashU_\n_has become one of the most popular alternative payment option for young Arabic online gamers and e-_\n_commerce buyers._\n\n## Ukash\n\n_Figure 6. Payment options using the Ukash service. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe description of Ukash shown in Figure 6 is largely taken from a Facebook post about the product:\n\n_Ukash is electronic cash and e-commerce brand. Based on a prepaid system, Ukash allows users to_\n_purchase and then spend money online._\n\n_Money can be purchased from one of the reported 420,000 participating retail locations worldwide, or by_\n_using the company's website. This electronic money can then be used to pay online, or loaded on to a_\n_prepaid card or eWallet._\n\n_You can combine multiple values of your Ukash into a single amount and have your new Ukash Code_\n_and value emailed to you if you want. You will need to register at Ukash.com, login and then go to the_\n_Manage Ukash area to use the Combine tool._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Paysafecard\n\nA screenshot of the Paysafecard dialog was not immediately available for this publication, but the\ndescription states:\n\n_Paysafecard is an electronic payment method for predominantly online shopping and is based on a pre-_\n_pay system. Paying with paysafecard does not require sharing sensitive bank account or credit card_\n_details. Using paysafecard is comparable to paying with cash in a shop and it is currently available in_\n_over 30 countries._\n\n_Paysafecard works by purchasing a PIN code printed on a card, and entering this code at webshops._\n\n_Paysafecard is available from many supermarkets, petrol stations, tobacconists and newsagents._\n\n## Bitcoin\n\n_Figure 7. Payment options using the Bitcoin service. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe description of Bitcoin shown in Figure 7 is copied almost verbatim from several online resources:\n\n_Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency where the creation and transfer of bitcoins is based on an open-source_\n_cryptographic protocol that is independent of any central authority. Bitcoins can be transferred through a_\n_computer or smartphone without an intermediate financial institution._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Green Dot MoneyPak\n\n_Figure 8. Payment options using the MoneyPak service. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n[The description of MoneyPak shown in Figure 8 is copied directly from the MoneyPak website:](https://www.moneypak.com/AboutMoneyPak.aspx)\n\n_MoneyPak is an easy and convenient way to send money to where you need it. The MoneyPak works_\n_as a 'cash top-up card'._\n\n**_Where can I purchase a MoneyPak?_**\n\n_MoneyPak can be purchased at thousands of stores nationwide, including major retailers such as_\n_Walmart, Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, Rite Aid, Kmart and Kroger. Click here to find a store near you._\n\n**_How do I buy a MoneyPak at the store?_**\n\n_Pick up a MoneyPak from the Prepaid Product Section or Green Dot display and take it to the register._\n_The cashier will collect your cash and load it onto the MoneyPak._\n\n## Current payment options\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough early versions of CryptoLocker included numerous payment options, the threat actors now only\naccept MoneyPak and Bitcoin. The Bitcoin option was originally marketed as the \"most cheap option\"\n\n[sic] for ransom payment based on the difference between the $300 USD ransom and the market rate of\nBitcoins. From August to December 2013, the Bitcoin market experienced major volatility and\ndramatically increased in price, negating any monetary benefits for victims to choose this payment\nmethod.\n\nThe variety of payment options and currency choices in early CryptoLocker versions suggests the threat\nactors originally anticipated a global infection pattern. For reasons unknown to CTU researchers, the\nthreat actors elected to focus exclusively on English-speaking countries and removed the payment\noptions less popular in these countries.\n\nAnecdotal reports from victims who elected to pay the ransom indicate that the CryptoLocker threat\nactors honor payments by instructing infected computers to decrypt files and uninstall the malware.\nVictims who submit payments are presented with the payment activation screen shown in Figure 9 until\nthe threat actors validate the payment. During this payment validation phase, the malware connects to\nthe C2 server every fifteen minutes to determine if the payment has been accepted. According to reports\nfrom victims, payments may be accepted within minutes or may take several weeks to process.\n\n_Figure 9. Payment activation screen. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n## Late payment\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early November 2013, the threat actors introduced the CryptoLocker Decryption Service (see Figure\n10). This service gives victims who failed to pay the ransom before the timer expired a way to retrieve\nthe encrypted files from their infected system.\n\n_Figure 10. The \"CryptoLocker Decryption Service\" landing page. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe service uploads the first kilobyte of an encrypted file, which contains the header prepended by the\nmalware. The threat actors use that data to query their database for the RSA private key that matches\nthe RSA public key used during file encryption. If the private key is located, the threat actors present the\nvictim with the page shown in Figure 11. The victim is given the option of sending payment to a randomly\ngenerated Bitcoin wallet. Early versions of this service charged 10 BTC, but the price was quickly\nreduced to 2 BTC. After receiving the payment, the threat actors redirect victims to a page that includes\ninstructions on how to decrypt files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Page displayed when the private key is successfully located. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n## Collected ransoms\n\n[In December 2013, Michele Spagnuolo published a thesis discussing a Bitcoin forensics framework](http://miki.it/pdf/thesis.pdf)\n[called BitIodine. He discusses identifying Bitcoin addresses controlled by the CryptoLocker threat actors](http://miki.it/articles/papers/#bitiodine)\nand tracing potential ransom payments made to those addresses. Figure 12 graphs the total number of\nransoms paid per day (in gray) along with the total value of those payments in U.S. dollars on the day\nthey were received (in blue).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. Ransoms paid through Bitcoin. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nUsing the daily weighted BTC price, if the threat actors had sold the 1,216 total BTC collected over the\nperiod shown in Figure 12 immediately upon receiving them, they would have earned nearly $380,000. If\nthey elected to hold these ransoms, they would be worth nearly $980,000 as of this publication based on\nthe current weighted price of $804/BTC.\n\nThese figures represent a conservative estimate of the number of ransoms collected by the\nCryptoLocker gang. Based on conversations with U.S.-based victims, the ease of payment with\nMoneyPak and the numerous technical barriers to obtaining Bitcoins led to most payments being made\nthrough the former method. CTU researchers suspect that a significant portion of Bitcoin payments are\nbeing made by individuals outside of the U.S., where MoneyPak is not available and Bitcoin is the only\noption. Based on this information and measurements of infection rates, CTU researchers estimate a\nminimum of 0.4%, and very likely many times that, of CryptoLocker victims are electing to pay the\nransom.\n\n## Victims\n\nBased on its design, deployment method, and empirical observations of its distribution, CryptoLocker\nappears to target English-speakers, specifically those located in the United States. Malware authors\nfrom Russia and Eastern Europe, where the CryptoLocker authors are thought to originate, commonly\ntarget victims in North America and Western Europe. Law enforcement cooperation between these\nregions is complicated by numerous factors, which often results in threat actors believing that they can\noperate with impunity.\n\nCTU researchers observed early infections occurring disproportionately at financial institutions, but\nanecdotal reports suggest that early victims were in verticals as diverse as hospitality and public utilities.\nAs of this publication, there is no evidence the actors are targeting specific industries. The threat actors\nhave also broadened their attacks to include home Internet users in addition to professionals.\n\nCTU researchers began actively monitoring the CryptoLocker botnet on September 18, 2013 and\nanalyzed various data sources, including DNS requests, sinkhole data, and client telemetry, to build the\napproximate daily infection rates shown in Figure 13. Spikes coinciding with Cutwail spam campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nthat resulted in increased CryptoLocker infections are clearly indicated, including the period of high\nactivity from October through mid-November. Likewise, periodic lulls in activity have occurred frequently,\nincluding a span from late November through mid-December.\n\n_Figure 13. Approximated infection rates. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe CTU research team registered multiple domains from the pool used by CryptoLocker to construct a\nsinkhole infrastructure and assess the malware's global impact. Between October 22 and November 1,\n2013, 31,866 unique IP addresses contacted CTU sinkhole servers. Figure 14 shows the geographic\ndistribution of these IP addresses.\n\n_Figure 14. Global distribution of CryptoLocker infections between October 22 and November 1, 2013._\n_(Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe United States was disproportionately represented among countries with measurable infection rates.\nTable 4 lists countries with the top ten infection rates.\n\nCountry Number of infected systems Percentage of total\n\nUnited States 22,360 70.2%\n\nGreat Britain 1,767 5.5%\n\n\n-----\n\nIndia 818 2.6%\n\nThailand 691 2.2%\n\nPeru 688 2.2%\n\nCanada 658 2.1%\n\nPhilippines 645 2.0%\n\nIndonesia 427 1.3%\n\nIran 333 1.0%\n\nEcuador 264 0.8%\n\n_Table 4. Geographic breakdown of infection counts. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe CTU research team implemented a similar sinkhole infrastructure between December 9 and\nDecember 16, which was during a period of limited malware activity. Additionally, recent samples use\nhard-coded C2 domains, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn from information gathered from\nsinkhole domains. During this observation period, 6,459 unique IP addresses contacted the CTU\nsinkhole servers. Figure 15 shows the geographic distribution of these IP addresses.\n\n_Figure 15. Global distribution of CryptoLocker infections between December 9 and December 16, 2013._\n_(Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n[In the samples gathered by the December sinkhole, the United Kingdom and](https://www.secureworks.co.uk/) [Australia approached the](https://www.secureworks.com.au/)\nabsolute infection numbers of the U.S, despite having much smaller populations. CTU researchers are\nunsure whether this change is an anomaly or represents a change in the threat actors' strategy.\n\nTable 5 lists countries with the top ten infection rates.\n\n\n-----\n\nCountry Number of infected systems Percentage of total\n\nUnited States 1,540 23.8%\n\nGreat Britain 1,228 19.0%\n\nAustralia 836 12.9%\n\nFrance 372 5.8%\n\nBrazil 309 4.8%\n\nItaly 204 3.2%\n\nTurkey 182 2.8%\n\nSpain 145 2.2%\n\nChina 138 2.1%\n\nCanada 135 2.1%\n\n_Table 5. Geographic breakdown of infection counts. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nBased on the presented evidence, CTU researchers estimate that 200,000 to 250,000 systems were\ninfected globally in the first 100 days of the CryptoLocker threat.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nBy incorporating the following components in a defense-in-depth strategy, organizations may be able to\nmitigate the CryptoLocker threat:\n\nBlock executable files and compressed archives containing executable files before they reach a\nvictim's inbox. Email remains a top infection vector for malware in general and this threat in\nparticular.\nConsider aggressively blocking known indicators (see Table 6) from communicating with your\nnetwork to temporarily neuter the malware until it can be discovered and removed. CryptoLocker\ndoes not encrypt files until it has successfully contacted an active C2 server.\nReevaluate permissions on shared network drives to prevent unprivileged users from modifying\nfiles.\nRegularly back up data with so-called \"cold,\" offline backup media. Backups to locally connected,\nnetwork-attached, or cloud-based storage are not sufficient because CryptoLocker encrypts these\nfiles in the same manner as those found on the system drive.\n[Implement Software Restriction Policies (SRPs) to prevent programs like CryptoLocker from](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/software-restriction-policies/software-restriction-policies)\nexecuting in common directories such as %AppData% or %LocalAppData%.\nUse Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to create and restrict permissions on registry keys used by\nCryptoLocker, such as HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\CryptoLocker (and variants). If the malware cannot\nopen and write to these keys, it terminates before encrypting any files.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nCryptoLocker is neither the first ransomware nor the first destructive malware to wreak havoc on\ninfected systems. However, the malware authors appear to have made sound design decisions that\ncomplicate efforts to mitigate this threat and have demonstrated a capable distribution system based on\nthe Cutwail and Gameover Zeus botnets. Evidence collected by CTU researchers confirms the threat\nactors have previous experience in malware development and distribution, especially of ransomware.\nBased on the duration and scale of attacks, they also appear to have the established and substantial\n\"real world\" infrastructure necessary to \"cash out\" ransoms and launder the proceeds.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nTo mitigate exposure to the CryptoLocker malware, CTU researchers recommend that clients use\navailable controls to restrict access using the indicators in Table 6. The domains listed in the indicators\ntable may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser. CTU\nresearchers have attempted to remove IP addresses and domain names operated by security vendors\nand private researchers, but some non-malicious infrastructure may be included. Date gaps in domain\nname information represent periods when the threat actors elected not to register malicious domains or\nwhen CTU researchers had insufficient data to determine those domain names.\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\nqwlpubwopsyj.org Domain\nname\n\nsypdwysctilgr.net Domain\nname\n\ntxeuntcemcwj.biz Domain\nname\n\nqqkoluhwexlr.biz Domain\nname\n\nxeogrhxquuubt.com
