The\n[authors have designed it to operate through the Tor network. According to the author, Sphinx](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22861/cyber-crime/tor-network-increasingly-attractive-cybercrime.html)\n[is immune to sinkholing, blacklisting, and the ZeuS tracker.](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/sinkholes-legal-technical-issues-fight-botnets/)\n\nThe Sphinx kit is currently available for sale at $500 USD per binary, the seller accepts\nBitcoin and DASH as a method of payment. Buyer need to register on a website to make the\npayment, once registered both BTC and DASH addresses are generated.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the seller will receive the payment, buyer account is enabled and will get the rights\nto edit the config and request a build.\n\n[The seller sustains that operators that will buy it do not need bulletproof hosting, below the](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/20371/cyber-crime/bulletproof-hosting-syria-lebanon.html)\nlist of feature implemented in the Sphinx Features:\n\n**_Malware:_**\n\n_Formgrabber and Webinjects for latest Internet Explorer, Mozilla._\n_Firefox and Tor Browser with cookie grabber and transparent page redirect(Webfakes)._\n_Backconnect SOCKS, VNC._\n_Socks 4/4a/5 with UDP and IPv6 support._\n_FTP, POP3 grabber._\n_Certificate grabber._\n_Keylogger._\n\n**_Certificate grabber:_**\n\n\n-----\n\nSphinx is able to intercept certificates when they are in use to establish a secure connection\nor for signing a file. It is very common in the criminal underground to abuse digital\ncertificates, for example to digitally sign malware code with digital certificates of a trusted\norganization in order to to bypass antivirus solutions.\n\n**Backconnect VNC:**\n\nThis is the most essential feature of a banking trojan. It allows you to make money transfers\nfrom the victims computer. Your VNC is done on a different desktop than the victim’s\ndesktop, so its completely hidden.\n\nYou can steal money from the bank while the victim is playing multiplayer games or watching\nmovies. Forget about configuring the browser, because when carding with Sphinx you don’t\nneed to.\n\nWith Backconnect VNC you can also remove anti-virus/rapport software from the victim’s\ncomputer. Port-forwarding for the victim is not required due to the use of Reverse\nconnection.\n\n**Backconnect SOCKS:**\n\nUse your victims as a SOCKS proxy. Port-forwarding is not required due to use of Reverse\nconnection.\n\n**Webinjects:**\n\nUsed for speeding up report gathering. With Webinjects you can change the content of a\nwebsite and ask for more information. You can do such things as asking for credit-card data\nfrom victims PayPal/Amazon/Ebay/Facebook for successful login.\n\nWebinjects use ZeuS format. You have to create your own web injects or use those that are\npublicly available. Sphinx uses ZeuS format so all released webinjects for\nZeus/Spyeye/Citadel are compatible.\n\n**Webfakes:**\n\nUsed to do phishing attacks without having to trick the victim into going in to a fake domain.\nFor example: When configured for bankofamerica, the user is transparently redirected to\nyour phishing site without changing the url.\n\n**Installation:**\n\nAt the moment, the bot is primarily designed to work under Windows Vista/Seven, with\nenabled UAC, and without the use of local exploits. Therefore, the bot is designed to work\nwith minimal privileges (including the user “Guest”).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this regard the bot is always working within sessions-per-user. The bot can be set for\neach user in the OS, and the bots do not know about each other. When you run the bot as a\n“LocalSystem” user it will attempt to infect all users on the system.\n\nWhen you install Sphinx, the bot creates its copy in the user’s home directory. This copy is\ntied to the current user and OS, and cannot be run by another user. The original copy of the\nsame bot that was used for installation, will be automatically deleted, regardless of\nthe installation success.\n\n**Communication:**\n\nSession with the server through a variety of processes from an internal “white list” that allows\nyou to bypass most firewalls. During the session, the bot can get the configuration to send\nthe accumulated reports, report their condition to the server, and receive commands\nto execute on the computer.\n\nThe session takes place via HTTP-protocol, all data sent by a bot and received from the\nserver is encrypted with a unique key for each botnet.\n\n**Webpanel:**\n\nSphinx command and control (C&C) has not changed from ZeuS. Old ZeuS fans will be\npleased to use this comfortable bot network control system again. Its coded in PHP using\nextensions mbstring and mysql.\n\n**Features:**\n\nXMPP notification.\nStatistics.\nBotlist.\nScripts\n\n**XMPP notification:**\n\nYou can receive notifications from the Control Panel in a Jabber-account.\n\nAt the moment there is the possibility of receiving notifications about a user entering defined\nHTTP/HTTPS-resources. For example: it is used to capture a user session at an online bank.\n\n**Scripts:**\n\nYou can control the bots by creating a script for them. Currently, syntax and scripting\ncapabilities, are very primitive.\n\n**Botlist:**\n\nFiltering the list by country botnets IP-addresses NAT-status etc\n\n\n-----\n\nDisplaying desktop screenshots in real time (only for bots outside NAT).\nMass inspection of the Socks-servers state.\n\n**Displays detailed information about the bots:**\n\nWindows version, user language and time zone.\nLocation and computer IP-address (not for local).\nInternet connection speed (measured by calculating the load time of a predetermined\nHTTP-resource).\nThe first and last time of communication with the server.\nTime online.\nAbility to set comment for each bot.\n\n**Statistics:**\n\nNumber of infected computers.\nCurrent number of bots in the online.\nThe number of new bots.\nDaily activity of bots.\nCountry statistics.\nStatistics by OS.\n\nThe seller suggests “using Internet Explorer traffic for the exploit-kit in order to get maximal\nprofit while using Sphinx.”\n\nAt the time I was writing the Tor website site http://dagxkme5nbxm5nkh.onion reported in the\nad appears down.\n\nStay Tuned!\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n**[(Security Affairs – Zeus banking trojan, Sphinx)](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)**\n\n[banking trojanCybercrimeHackingmalwareSphinxundergroundZeus](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking-trojan)\n\nShare On\n\n\n-----\n\nYou might also like\n\n**[Experts believe that Russian Gamaredon APT could fuel a new round of DDoS attacks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131762/apt/gamaredon-apt-ddos-attacks.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\n\n-----\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
