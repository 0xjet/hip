As a result,\nwe’ve created this threat assessment report for the Hangover Group’s activities. The\n[techniques and campaigns can be visualized using the Unit 42 Playbook Viewer.](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=hangover)\n\nHangover Group is a cyberespionage group that was first observed in December 2013\ncarrying on a cyberattack against a telecom corporation in Norway. Cybersecurity firm\nNorman [reported that the cyberattacks were emerging from India and the group sought and](https://web.archive.org/web/20170825010151/http://enterprise-manage.norman.c.bitbit.net/resources/files/Unveiling_an_Indian_Cyberattack_Infrastructure.pdf)\ncarried on attacks against targets of national interest, such as Pakistan and China. However,\n\n\n-----\n\nthere have been indicators of Hangover activity in the U.S. and Europe. Mainly focusing on\ngovernment, military, and civilian organizations. The Hangover Group's initial vector of\ncompromise is to carry out spear-phishing campaigns. The group uses local and topical\nnews lures from the South Asia region to make their victims more prone to falling into their\nsocial engineering techniques, making them download and execute a weaponized Microsoft\nOffice document. After the user executes the weaponized document, backdoor\ncommunication is established between BackConfig and the threat actors, allowing attackers\nto carry on espionage activity, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data from compromised\nsystems.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks Threat Prevention platform with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention) [WildFire,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) [DNS Security and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/threat-detection-and-prevention/dns-security) [Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\ndetects activity associated with this threat group.

Courses of Action for Hangover Group_\n\n_†These capabilities are part of the NGFW security subscriptions service_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Hangover Group is active and, according to Unit 42 visibility, is targeting government\nand military organizations in South Asia.\n\nThe group continues to make use of compromised, third-party infrastructure to support the\ndelivery of their weaponized documents, using spear-phishing emails containing links to said\nsites.\n\nThe delivery documents continue to evolve and, over the years, have moved from plain text\ncode and URLs to encoded. From storing encoded executables within the documents, to\nusing ZIP files - including a package of files - to finally downloading executables from\ncommand and control servers.\n\nThe installation of the BackConfig malware by the delivery documents is performed using\nmultiple stages and components, most likely to evade sandboxes or other automated\nanalysis and detection systems. This includes the use of Virtualization-based Security (VBS),\nbatch codes, scheduled tasks, and conditional trigger files.\n\nOnce fully installed, the BackConfig malware communicates with the threat actors using\nHTTPS making visibility and detection potentially more difficult, and blends in amongst other\nsimilar traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce an infected system is under an actor s control, the objective varies on the plugins\ndeployed and the type of system or organization compromised.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_The suggested courses of action in this report are based on the information currently_\n_available to Palo Alto Networks and the capabilities within Palo Alto Networks’ products and_\n_services._\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
