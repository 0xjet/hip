In this type\nof attack, the threat actor will make use of certain\nwebsites that the victim often visits. For what was\nobserved in the wild, StrongPity actors were able\nto tamper some localized software aggregates and\nsharers.\n\nUsually, website visitors, when trying to download\na certain installer, are redirected to a dedicated\ndownload server, as a result of a rewritten request\nto the legitimate server. If a user is of interest to the\nthreat actor (his/her IP address is within one of the\nranges it targets), the server will return the tampered\nversion of that installer. Otherwise, the user will receive\nthe original version of it.\n\nThe servers where the targeted users are redirected\nare referred as the download servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nStrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure\n\n## Trojanized installers\n\nThe malicious installers, which are served to the targeted victims, are quite interesting. The actor uses a custom\nbundler/dropper, digitally signed (with a self-signed certificate), that embodies the malicious components and the\noriginal, legit software product. But these initial droppers are very different, even if they are generated immediately one\nfrom another. The encryption key for the components changes from one installer to other, although they tend to have\nthe same key length for each campaign.\n\nDuring our investigation, we were able to gather several samples of these tampered installers. The affected\napplications fall into several categories, such as application for compression like 7-zip and WinRAR archiver, security\nsoftware such as McAfee Security Scan Plus, file recovery application - Recuva, application for remote connection such\nas TeamViewer, chat application such as WhatsApp or different tools and utilities like Piriform CCleaner, CleverFiles\nDisk Drill, DAEMON Tools Lite, Glary Utilities, or RAR Password Unlocker, covering a wide range of needs.\n\nEach initial dropper has a compile time, the exact date the tampered installer was created. When we investigated this\naspect, we observed that all the files we managed to retrieve were compiled from Monday to Friday, a normal work\nweek. Another interesting aspect is that the time interval for these timestamps is around 9 hours, which is a workday\nnorm. If we were to place this norm in a 9 to 6 working schedule the time zone would be UTC+2.\n\n\n-----\n\nStrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure\n\nThe above observation strengthens the idea that this threat is sponsored, and we are dealing with an organized\ndeveloper team paid to work for this “project”.\n\n## The download server\n\nWhile monitoring the threat actor activity, we were able to investigate several points from the infrastructure.\n\nThe download servers had some interesting particularities.\n\nThe actor has taken some security measures in order to ensure that only the “right” connections are accepted.\n\nThey use a helper script (self-named “Debian Stretch Hardening Script”) with the following help message:\n```\n    usage: $0 options\n    Debian Stretch Hardening Script\n    OPTIONS:\n    -u Admin User\n    -p SSH Port\n    -k SSH Public Key (example : “ssh-rsa AAA...”)\n    -d Domain Name\n    -n Knock Ports (example : 10001,10002,10003,10004)\n    --helpHelp\n\n```\nThe script, among other actions, updates all the packages, creates the “admin user” on the system (and computes\nthe password for it, based on the Knock ports and SSH port), configures nginx and configures knockd service and the\nfirewall. Due to an error in the script, the password is always the same. This does not represent a problem because the\nSSH daemon is configured to only allow public key authentication.\n\nIn one instance, the actor used a sequence of four Knock Ports when calling the script.\n\nInterestingly, there seems to be a specific IP from Israel that is denied any connection to the download server, an IP\naddress which seems to belong to an important science university.\n\nReviewing the software logic, we identified 2 directories with malicious binary files and 3 PHP scripts:\n\n1. configuration.php – contains the locations of those 2 directories and a list named $targets (which should contain a\nlist of IP ranges, but it is empty) and a mapping from 32 hex-digits to filename (which does not represent the md5\nhash of the file, but uniquely identifies it- referenced from now on as file-id).\n\n   - read.php – contains two functions:\n\n   - checkUserIP() which checks if an IP address is contained in the $targets list\n\n2. serveFile() – serve an installer file to the client\n\n3. inject.php – the main logic. It Includes the other 2 php files, validates that the IP of the connecting client is among\nthe targets list defined in configuration.php, checks the file-id and serves the chosen file.\n\nAccording to the logic of the scripts, one of the directories should contain the original installers and the other the\ntampered ones. If the IP address of the victim is in the $targets list, a trojanized installer would be delivered, otherwise\na legitimate one would be served. In the case of the nodes we investigated, both directories contained the exact same\nfiles and the $targets list was empty, meaning that any valid connection would get the malicious installer.\n\n\n-----\n\nStrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure\n```\nhttps://<download server>/<8 character folder>/<the 32 hex-digits that identify the\n\n```\nfile>\n\nBut, in the nodes that we have analyzed, a valid URL would have the form:\n```\nhttps://<download server>/<8 character folder>/<the inject.php file>?params=<the 32 hex\n\n```\ndigits that identifies the file>.\n\nThis discrepancy points to either the nodes being out of use, or, the known URL scheme being changed.\n\n[Any other requests are redirected to https://google.com](https://google.com/)\n\n## Command and Control Servers\n\n###### Once the malicious installer is downloaded and executed, the backdoor is installed. The backdoor will communicate with a command and control server, embedded into its binary, for document exfiltration and for retrieving commands to be executed, depending on the importance of the victim.\n\n From an OPSEC point of view, the actor takes different actions in order to hide and anonymize its traces. The C2 network uses a set of proxy servers to hide the terminal node/nodes in the infrastructure. At the moment of writing, we have identified at least three layers in this infrastructure.\n\n### First layer\n\nThe first layer is made up of IPs to which the malware will try to connect. Each of these IPs has a unique domain\nassociated to it that is embedded in the binary. These are in fact proxies to other machines.\n\nThe nodes we have seen use the PHP curl bindings to forward the request to the next server in the chain they know\n(one script for file exfiltration and one script for retrieving commands). If a node is compromised, one could not have\ndetails about the entire infrastructure, knowing only about the nodes before it and the node it submits data to.\n\nThe first layer does some basic validation and forwards the traffic to and from another server, which usually is located\nin a different country, at a different provider. The communication between the first layer and its upstream is HTTPS (the\ncertificate is not verified) on an unusual TCP port for this protocol – 1402.\n\nAs for the software stack, nginx and php are used and configured to respond with 404 to all incorrect requests (either\nnon-existing files, for which nginx serves the 404 response or for incorrect parameters to the PHP scripts, which falls\ninto the php script’s responsibility to serve the 404 code).\n\n### Second layer\n\nThe second layer is composed of the IP addresses that the first layer forwards data to. These IPs do not seem to have\nany domains linked to them and have multiple first layer IPs pointing to them.\n\n[Other writeups mention the PHP scripts goN9Z2In7mYQmN92dzX11CQL.php (for file upload) and](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/whack-a-mole-the-impact-of-threat-intelligence-on-adversaries.html)\n```\np5Pss34GvX21pxO0bz25vLqU.php (for getting the commands). These PHP files still exist in the whole\n\n```\ninfrastructure, but they now reside on the 2[nd] layer proxy, with the 1[st] layer/public facing script being named info.\n```\nphpor phpinfo.php (for file uploads) and ini.php or parse_ini_file.php (for the commands). The table below\n\n```\nillustrates the names of these PHP scripts our researchers retrieved during the investigation on each layer from the\ninfrastructure:\n\n\n-----\n\nStrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure\n\n\n**1[st] layer** **2[nd] layer** **3[rd] layer** **Functionality**\n\n`info.php` `goN9Z2In7mYQmN92dzX11C-` `WNpRAq-yeVPQ@.php` file upload\n```\n            QL.php\nphpinfo.php\n\n```\n`ini.php` `p5Pss34GvX21pxO0bz-` [Z3@Pp6!8nb7T5pUP_=wAsr-](mailto:Z3@Pp6!8nb7T5pUP_=wAsrr2tKTZdf4=gp.php) `Get commands`\n\n`25vLqU.php` [r2tKTZdf4=gp.php](mailto:Z3@Pp6!8nb7T5pUP_=wAsrr2tKTZdf4=gp.php)\n\nparse_ini_file.php\n\nBoth the first and second layers have the SSH daemon configured to listen on a high port (bigger than 1024). By\navoiding the use of the default port for a certain protocol, the threat actors are trying to ”stay under the radar” from\ncommon Internet scanners and search engines like Shodan or Censys.\n\nAs far as our researchers were able to investigate, the threat actors use a VPN service for connecting and\nadministrating the servers, usually from secureconnect.me or torguardvpnaccess.com.\n\nThe figure below summarizes the communication between the proxy layers after an infection was performed:\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, we were able to map 47 servers with different functionalities. It does not seem that the threat\nactor prefers a particular hosting provider or region to set up the infrastructure, but most of them are in Europe.\n\n\n-----\n\nStrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure\n\n### Components and Communication Protocol\n\nOnce the tampered installer is downloaded and executed, it will drop 4 files: the Legit Setup, the Launcher and\nPersistence component, the Exfiltration and Command Execution component and the File Searcher component.\n\nThe first executed file is the original installer, which will be prompted to the user so that they would not suspect\nanything. All malicious actions are performed in the background.\n\nAll of these 4 components are encrypted in the resource section of the initial dropper. Each resource has an 8-byte\nheader that tells the dropper the size of the executable and the component type.\n\nA summary of the installation process is illustrated in the figure below:\n\nAfter the Launcher component is dropped into the %SYSTEM% folder, it is executed by calling the function responsible\nfor creating a new service. The name of the service is a common one, either replacing a non-vital system service\n(Print Spooler) or having a name that does not raise any suspicions (Registry Maintenance Server). The\nservice will be used as a persistence mechanism and will execute the Launcher component.\n\nThe dropper starts the service and will drop the rest of the executables.\n\nThe Launcher component executes the Exfiltration and Command Execution component, usually placed in the same\nsystem folder, and waits for an uninstall event.\n\nThe Exfiltration component is responsible for running the File Searcher component and for exfiltrating the files to the\nC&C server through a POST request. It regularly asks the C&C server for download and execution commands or an\n_uninstall command. The last one, if received, will be sent as an event to the Launcher component. The get_command is_\nsent as POST request with an argument called name that contains a tag. This tag is used as a form of authentication\nand is influenced by the compilation time of the file. In our tests, the servers always seem to respond with a 404 if\nasked for a command.\n\nThe File Searcher component loops through every drive and looks for files with certain extensions. The malicious binary\nhas an extension list embedded (usually identifying different types of documents). If a file with an extension from that\n\n\n-----\n\nStrongPity APT - Revealing Trojanized Tools, Working Hours and Infrastructure\n\ninto hidden .sft encrypted files. The .sft files are read by the Exfiltration component, sent to the C&C server and deleted\nfrom the disk.\n\nAfter the exfiltration process is completed, the Exfiltration component will wait for further commands as described\nabove.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the files that will be exfiltrated are first copied into a zip file. This zip file will be encrypted into\nmultiple .sft files as follows:\n\n- The File Searcher component will read 2048 bytes from the zip file\n\n- For each byte it will apply a xor operation between the least significant 4 bits and the most significant 4 bits and it\nwill write the result in the .sft file\n\n- The first two steps are repeated a maximum of 53 times\n\n- If the zip file still has unprocessed data, a new .sft file will be created\n\n- For each zip file, the first .sft file will have a N prepended as a first character, the rest of the .sft files which complete\nan archive will have an O prepended.\n## Victims\n\nWhile screening the victims it was obvious that this threat is an extremely targeted one. The majority of victims are\nconcentrated in the area of Turkey and Syria.\n\nZooming in, we were able to observe that most of the targets are located near the border between Turkey and Syria, as\nwell as in Istanbul, enforcing the idea that this threat might be involved in the geo-political conflict between Turkey and\nthe Kurdish community.\n\n\n-----\n\nStrongPity APT -
