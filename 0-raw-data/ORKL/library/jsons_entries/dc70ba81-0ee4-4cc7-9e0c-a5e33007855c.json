    "plain_text": "# Removing Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior From Ethiopia\n\n**[about.fb.com/news/2021/06/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-from-ethiopia/](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-from-ethiopia/)**\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\n**We removed a network of accounts, Pages and Groups in Ethiopia for coordinated**\n**inauthentic behavior** **(CIB). It targeted domestic audiences in its own country.**\n\nThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a\ncentral part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are\ndoing, and that was the basis for our action. When we investigate and remove CIB\noperations, we focus on behavior rather than content, no matter who’s behind them, what\nthey post, or whether they’re foreign or domestic.\n\nOver the past four years, we’ve shared our findings about coordinated inauthentic behavior\nwe detect and remove from our platforms. Each month, we publish CIB reports where we\nshare information about the networks we take down over the course of each month to make\nit easier for people to see the progress we’re making in one place. In some cases, like today,\n\n\n-----\n\nwe also share our findings at the time of enforcement. The takedown we are announcing\ntoday will also be included in our June 2021 report. You can find more information about our\n[previous CIB enforcement actions here.](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\n\nWe are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing\neffort. We’re committed to continually improving to stay ahead.\n\n**WHAT WE FOUND**\n_(We will update the numbers as soon as the latest data becomes available)_\n\n**We removed 62 Facebook accounts, 49 Pages, 26 Groups, and 32 accounts on**\n**Instagram for violating our policy against** **[coordinated inauthentic behavior. (Updated](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)**\n_on July 7, 2021 at 6:00PM PT to reflect the latest enforcement numbers.) This network_\n**originated in and focused on domestic audiences in Ethiopia.**\n\nThe operation used duplicate and fake accounts — some of which were already detected\nand disabled by our automated systems — to post and comment on their own content, and\nmanage Groups and Pages, including those posing as media entities. The campaign\nappeared to accelerate their posting activity in 2020 and into 2021, and some of its recent\ncontent was rated false by independent fact-checkers and labeled as misleading. Some of\nthe accounts went through significant name changes over time. They also used spam-like\ninauthentic distribution tactics to post the same content across multiple Pages and Groups\nsimultaneously, including other people’s Groups.\n\nThis network posted primarily in Amharic about news and current events in Ethiopia,\nincluding the Prosperity party, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and criticism of Egypt and Sudan\nrelated to Ethiopia’s mega dam project. They also posted critical commentary about various\nopposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, including Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian\nDemocratic Party, and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front among others. Most recently, they\ncommented about protests against the US sanctions on Ethiopia. We assess that this activity\nwas not directly focused on the Tigray region or the ongoing conflict in Tigray.\n\nWe found this network as part of our internal investigation into suspected coordinated\ninauthentic behavior in the region. Although the people behind it attempted to conceal their\nidentities and coordination, our investigation found links to individuals associated with INSA,\nthe Information Network Security Agency in Ethiopia.\n\n_Presence on Facebook and Instagram: 62_ Facebook accounts, 49 Pages, 26 Groups\nand 32 Instagram accounts. (Updated on July 7, 2021 at 6:00PM PT to reflect the\n**_latest enforcement numbers.)_**\n_Followers: About 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of these Pages, about_\n766,000 accounts joined one or more of these Groups, and around 1,700 people\nfollowed one or more of these Instagram accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Advertising: About $7,200 in spending for ads paid for in US dollars. (Updated on July_\n**_7, 2021 at 6:00PM PT to reflect the latest numbers.)_**\n\nBelow is a sample of the content posted by some of these Pages and accounts:\n\n**Translation:**\n\n**Caption: Debretseion’s death is being talked about on social media. It seems all that threat**\nhas gone to grave. It is usually the case that an empty threat of a “shiro” is until a spoon finds\nit.\n\n**Image overlay: Debretsion, the warthog, has been making threats wearing his gloves but he**\nhas gone to the grave. Ego takes one to\n\nthe grave.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Translation:**\n\n**Image overlay: Those who know him, know him well. Those who don’t know him are getting**\nto know him now. he knows how to persuade his enemies with his bright path.\n\nStay strong our leader. Millions of us have decided to stand with you.\n\nPost and\n\n\n-----\n\ncomments by this network’s Page and account.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Translation:**\n\n**Caption: The supporters of the junta which has been blown to ashes in two weeks by our**\nmilitary and amhara special forces are now using hashtag campaigns to get international\nintervention and support. this is a nightmare. Does one think the group which has been\ndefeated while having tanks and missiles can come back to life through a false campaign?\nNever. This is like trying to hug a cloud.\n**Image overlay: The Tigray genocide is only happening on social media, particularly on**\nTwitter.\n\n\n-----",
