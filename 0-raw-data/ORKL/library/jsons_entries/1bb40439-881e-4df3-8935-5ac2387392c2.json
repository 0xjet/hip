This\nfamily is known under two names, Braviax and FakeRean. The family has been active for\n[quite some years, it was first spotted by [S!Ri](https://twitter.com/siri_urz “S!Ri Twitter”) back](https://twitter.com/siri_urz)\nin April 2009. In this blogpost I will perform an analysis on the current version of this family\nmaking it’s rounds online and a history of it starting back in 2009. A big thank you goes out to\n\n[[S!Ri](https://twitter.com/siri_urz) for sharing some historical data on this group.](https://twitter.com/siri_urz)\n\nThe reason why I’m releasing this article now on a group active back in January of this year\nis that, if you follow the timeline I show below, is that they should have reappeared around\nthis time of year (although I haven’t seen them yet).\n\nThe Braviax/Fakerean family has quite some similarities with the Tritrax (dubbed\nNamechanger FakeAV) family I analyzed and hunted down back in February 2014 (Post:\n\n[Analysis of the Tritax FakeAV family, their active campaign and the FakeAV social\nengineering kit](http://blog.0x3a.com/post/75474731248/analysis-of-the-tritax-fakeav-familytheir-active)).\nBraviax/Fakerean is also one constantly changing its name as you can see from a\ncombination of screenshots made from samples starting in September 2014 until the start of\nJanuary 2015:\n\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/bca28376345d856691adf3322a30394c/tumblr_nlm2bkOQtZ1qf\nlx2go5_r1_540.png)\n\nAs said, back in September 2014 this new variant became active. After seeing it pass by\nmultiple times I decided to look into it a bit. At some point I started noticing the name\nchanges due to the fact that the website, website banner and the actual ‘antivirus’ names\ndidn’t match up at all, I tweeted about this on the 27th of September:\n\n\n-----\n\n[#FakeAV website calls it Rango Antivirus, banner Win XP Security, sample run A-](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FakeAV?src=hash)\n[Secure’ (https://t.co/EgYDdzDqFd)](https://t.co/EgYDdzDqFd) [pic.twitter.com/i1amKQLsIy](http://t.co/i1amKQLsIy)\n\n— Yonathan Klijnsma (@ydklijnsma)\n[November 27, 2014](https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma/status/537871852606328832)\n\n[//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js](https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js)\n\nFrom this point on I started looking into this FakeAV threat some more, it started to hit quite\noften. Quite quickly I could pin this as one as part of the Fakerean/Braviax family and started\nto analyze it.\n\n## Analysis: Spreading mechanism\nWe’ll start the analysis of this family with the method of how it was spread, simply by mail.\nAround the 18th of December 2014 fake FedEx emails began to appear, one of these\ncarying methods of infecting victims with this FakeAV. The email looked like this:\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/83777a2a260029f791336b77ed05447f/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qflx\n2go4_r1_1280.png)\nIn the emails’ attachment we find a JS file:\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/a29311709ac1ee9ab3148c19d90e1186/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qfl\nx2go5_r1_1280.png)\nInside of this script we find a large piece of obfuscated script:\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/681e7d4b1d06109e42d8329afd3e149d/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qfl\nx2go6_r1_1280.png)\nIf we clean it up we can see its just a simple downloader which tries to infect the user with 3\npieces of malware (shotgun approach much..):\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/2f198864b3493728355ab3919fe6a06a/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qflx\n2go7_r1_1280.png)\nFrom the three payloads only one is the interesting one for this article; its the\nBraviax/FakeRean sample. Would you want to perform a more detailed analysis (rather than\nthe very short one below), the sample coming from this email and used further is:\n\n[1d01611a1f88c7015c54efedacfcbc8fec55ad6de9a438087abff3be78c19901]\n(https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/1d01611a1f88c7015c54efedacfcbc8fec55ad6de9a438087\nabff3be78c19901/analysis/)\n\n## Quick analysis: a Braviax/FakeRean sample\nBecause this article is more about the history of this family rather than the specifics of the\nFakeAV this part will be a very(!) short analysis of the sample.\nWhen ran the FakeAV shows the usual pop-up with information on your system being\ninfected:\n\n\n-----\n\n![image]\n(https://36.media.tumblr.com/628a1e91dbebef773867c074d0c7c9b4/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qflx\n2go8_r2_1280.jpg)\nAdditionally when you close the window (or try to close the FakeAV program in any way) a\nfake Windows security center window will pop-up:\n![image]\n(https://36.media.tumblr.com/7fc154b56dbc552afa70b143064d9097/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qflx\n2go9_r1_1280.jpg)\nIn the process of scaring the user the FakeAV copies itself to a new location and installs a\nregistry startup key, the normal persistence method seen. The FakeAV also monitors\nprocesses that are running and kills the ones it doesn’t like which includes system utilities\nlike taskmgr but also tools like wireshark and alike. All of this to convince the user into buying\nthe ‘product’ to clean up the ‘infection’ that stops them from starting these processes.\nThe FakeAV also performs some C2 communication which includes information on the\npayment C2 service:\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/246f33ced9f8215f3b3857e4302028e7/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qflx2\ngo10_r1_1280.png)\nThe client performs a request to the C2 server located at gelun-posak[.]com, the path is an\nencoded and base64’d unique system ID. The response contains a small config, the partially\nreadable text string ‘eo-moquales[.]Nom’ is in fact the payment wall which (after decoding) is\ngolen-mortales[.]com.\nOveral this FakeAV is just alike any other I’ve written on in the past. Payment service runs on\na seperate C2 server while the main C2 server is just for infection registration / statistics.\nEnough on the malware, lets move on to have a look at this family’s history.\n\n## The Family\n\nThe Braviax/Fakerean FakeAV family has been around for quite some time, [@S!Ri]\n[(https://twitter.com/siri_urz) first spotted them 6 years ago.](https://twitter.com/siri_urz)\nBack in around April 2009 samples started to appear for a FakeAV naming itself “Home\nAntivirus 2009″ and was the first of more to come:\n\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/775bb9ebf3302ed8302f9c2c58c3d2d8/tumblr_nlm29udmth1qfl\nx2go6_r2_540.png)\n\nAround the start of July it was followed by a 2nd version called “PC Security 2009″:\n\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/bba567b5e3a3b0f59160f30908cf41d4/tumblr_nlm2bkOQtZ1qfl\nx2go7_r1_540.png)\n\n\n-----\n\nA 3rd version appeared at the end of July already, this time called Home Antivirus 2010\n(even though still being 2009… they were ahead of time it seems):\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/ac521b48dd614859c8893b1653685bab/tumblr_nlm29udmth1qf\nlx2go7_r2_540.png)\n\nNear the end of August the 4th installment of the family appeared, this time it was called “PC\nAntispyware 2010”. This one actually loaded an AV database, stolen from ClamAV (in fact an\nold one from 2007):\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/36579be2d29cb960d6eec7ca7ca02ac9/tumblr_nlm2bkOQtZ1qf\nlx2go6_r1_540.png)\n\nThen in September the 5th version appeared, “Antivirus Pro 2010”:\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/0a7132ca437d2c5ca2b920dc304be799/tumblr_nlm29udmth1qf\nlx2go2_r2_540.png)\n\nIn 2009 5 versions of the Braviax/Fakerean family hit, from September until the end of\nJanuary 2010 it was quiet; nothing new appeared. At the end of January a completely\nchanged version appeared, this one changed it appearances depending on whether it ran on\nWindows XP, Vista or 7. Even under these platforms it had multiple names.\nUnder Windows XP it called itself one of the following names:\n\nAntivirus XP 2010\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/983284bcde5b875ee1f6a4c62157fcb6/tumblr_nlm29udmth1qfl\nx2go3_r2_540.png)\n\nXP Guardian\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/9276ab359f5ca9eff16226ffb4b21989/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qflx2\ngo4_540.png)\n\nXP Internet Security\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/ef2125059523522a6f250817874b9289/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qfl\nx2go9_540.png)\n\nUnder Windows Vista it called itself one of the following names:\n\nVista Antivirus Pro 2010\n![image]\n(https://36.media.tumblr.com/53ca86e9e1c6aab06dc107bb33b2bc04/tumblr_nlm2bkOQtZ1qf\nlx2go8 r1 540 png)\n\n\n-----\n\nVista Internet Security 2010\n![image]\n(https://36.media.tumblr.com/6c7771d5489358eb8d7cfd18b86a3405/tumblr_nlm2bkOQtZ1qf\nlx2go9_r1_540.png)\n\nFinally, under Windows 7 it called itself one of the following names:\n\nWin 7 Antispyware 2010\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/dd37d7d81d320526c5ec7986150a08eb/tumblr_nlm2bkOQtZ1q\nflx2go10_r1_540.png)\n\nWin 7 Internet Security 2010\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/168028a0bbb1bf7de5febadf103054ad/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qflx\n2go1_540.png)\n\nAn interesting move to have some name mangling dependent on the platform. After they\npushed these it stayed quiet until November. In November they released a new version with\nsimilar names, only the year was bumped from 2010 to 2011. The Windows XP variants for\nexample:\n\nXP Security 2011\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/39e8aa0325d377a24fbd96933b32efee/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qflx\n2go1_540.png)\n\nXP Antispyware 2011\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/71e6e4a7571d9474e956709e573a341b/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1q\nflx2go6_540.png)\n\nIn february 2011 a new version appeared with slightly updated names and GUI layout:\n\nXP Anti-Virus 2011\n![image]\n(https://36.media.tumblr.com/ea60a11c422d1f2233789ff79339c48a/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qflx\n2go7_540.png)\n\nXP Home Security 2011\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/ab67d2347efbee4e2681aff2252b7f5b/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qflx\n2go8_540.png)\n\n\n-----\n\nXP Anti-Spyware\n![image]\n(https://36.media.tumblr.com/77c2d08a661d9eade02489f8481a0b56/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qfl\nx2go5_540.png)\n\nIn the end of June 2011 another updated version was released. Again some updated OS\nbased name mangling changes and updated GUI:\n\nXP Internet Security 2012\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/f6ccfca28167ff0be1c69b8a0c0fad7f/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qflx2g\no10_540.png)\n\nWin7 Internet Security 2012\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/69d2cdb2fb8045d640e8af24907c9f22/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qflx\n2go3_540.png)\n\nAnother slightly updated version appeared in the end of November 2011, still based on the\nOS based name mangling:\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/ccefe37c48d122181c49ae3d55ae3c87/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qflx\n2go2_1280.png)\n\nJanuary 2012 a new updated version, GUI mostly, got pushed:\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/4ff19de42c53029791b1880d26e68b9e/tumblr_nlm29udmth1qfl\nx2go5_r2_1280.png)\n\nIn the start of October 2012 another slightly updated version appeared. Mostly GUI changes\nand again still based on the OS version name mangling:\n![image]\n(https://41.media.tumblr.com/3e2317efabcdcb6337bf24b8a852c27e/tumblr_nlm29udmth1qfl\nx2go4_r2_1280.png)\n\nThen almost a year later at the start of September 2014 the version from my analysis\nappeared. An entirely updated GUI and new names showed a big change. It appeared under\nthe following names (with OS version names displayed, although not all use it):\n\n- Sirius (Win 7|Win 8|Vista) Protection 2014\n\n- Zorton (Win 7|Win 8|Vista) Protection 2014\n\n- Rango (Win 7|Win 8|Vista) Protection 2014\n\n- A-Secure 2015\n\n- AVbytes (Win 7|Win 8|Vista) Antivirus 2015\n\n- AVC Plus\n\n\n-----\n\nGUI wise it looks like this (name stripped as its templated in the GUI at runtime):\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/607c1b287180d19cb4af11305f968453/tumblr_nlm9l2sz5h1qflx\n2go3_r1_1280.png)\n\nHowever in the end of September 2011 a sort of offspring appeared as well named\nAdvanced PC Shield 2012, another one appeared in August 2012 called Win 8 Security\nSystem:\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/c82429e29a4ac13a317c7de16d66a01b/tumblr_nlm29udmth1qf\nlx2go1_r2_540.png)\n![image]\n(https://40.media.tumblr.com/4e86a2d0b47ef0891329a41fd93a5e57/tumblr_nlm9jpDqdC1qfl\nx2go2_1280.png)\n\nEventhough this version is also ranked in the Braviax/Fakerean family it looks somewhat\ndifferent in setup.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Braviax/Fakerean family has been around for a long time appearing as early as April\n2009 and seems to be a success as new reincarnations appear every year.\nWhile they aren’t as big as a threat as banking malware or ransomware it does pay well for\nthese criminals. Because of their ‘low’ volume and simply being scareware not a lot of\nattention is given to them. I’ll be keeping an eye on them for future campaigns for sure\nthough :)\n\n## IOC’s & Samples\n\nThe following is a list of samples for the last version spreading from September 2014 to\nDecember 2014.
