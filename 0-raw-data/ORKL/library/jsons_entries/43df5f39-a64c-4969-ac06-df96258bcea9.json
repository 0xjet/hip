    "plain_text": "# Shifting Tactics: Tracking changes in years­long espionage campaign against Tibetans ­ The Citizen Lab\n\n_March 10, 2016_\n\nBy Jakub Dalek, Masashi Crete­Nishihata, and John Scott­Railton\n\n## Summary\n\nThis report describes the latest iteration in a long­running espionage campaign against the Tibetan\n\ncommunity. We detail how the attackers continuously adapt their campaigns to their targets, shifting\n\ntactics from document­based malware to conventional phishing that draws on “inside” knowledge of\n\ncommunity activities. This adaptation appears to track changes in security behaviors within the\n\n[Tibetan community, which has been promoting a move from sharing attachments via e­mail to using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4E1SRDmtZE)\n\ncloud­based file sharing alternatives such as Google Drive.\n\nWe connect the attack group’s infrastructure and techniques to a group previously identified by Palo\n\n[Alto Networks, which they named Scarlet Mimic. We provide further context on Scarlet Mimic’s](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)\n\ntargeting and tactics, and the intended victims of their attack campaigns. In addition, while Scarlet\n\nMimic may be conducting malware attacks using other infrastructure, we analyze how the attackers\n\nre­purposed a cluster of their malware Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to mount the recent\n\nphishing campaign.\n\nThis move is only the latest development in the ongoing cat and mouse game between attack groups\n\nlike Scarlet Mimic and the Tibetan community. The speed and ease with which attackers continue to\n\nadapt highlights the challenges faced by Tibetans who are trying to remain safe online.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Tibetan community has been the target of malware­enabled espionage campaigns for over a\n\ndecade. The attackers responsible for these campaigns are relentless in their attempts to\n\ncompromise networks and harvest sensitive information. These attacks often demonstrate high levels\n\nof sophistication in the social engineering used to entice targets to open malicious attachments or\n\n[links, but are typically not very technically advanced. A common technique is the use of document­](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-hardy.pdf)\n\n[based malware. In a recent four­year study on targeted malware attacks against civil society, which](https://targetedthreats.net/)\n\nincluded six Tibetan groups, we found that document­based malware was the most common attack\n\nvector, accounting in some cases for up to 95 percent of all attacks against specific Tibetan groups.\n\nThe Tibetan community has recognized these patterns and made efforts to change user behaviors to\n\nmitigate the attacks. For example, groups have started a digital security training campaign called\n\n[“Detach from Attachments”, which urges users to avoid sending or opening email attachments, and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4E1SRDmtZE)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Recently, Palo Alto Networks reported on a years­long espionage campaign they call “Scarlet Mimic”](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)\n\nthat targeted Tibetan and Uyghur groups (as well as government agencies in Russia and India). The\n\nScarlet Mimic campaigns are a typical example of the attacks civil society faces. Carefully crafted\n\nemail lures are sent to targets carrying exploits that leverage well­known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE­\n\n[2012­0158&lt, CVE­2010­3333), which we have seen used in campaigns against Tibetan groups](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3333)\n\nfrequently in recent years.\n\nIn this post, we show that servers used as malware C2 infrastructure by Scarlet Mimic are now\n\nhosting phishing pages designed to steal Google credentials from Tibetan activists and journalists.\n\nThis shift in tactics from malware to phishing campaigns suggests that the attackers are adapting to\n\nbehavioral changes in the Tibetan community. In the following sections, we provide an overview of\n\nmalware campaigns connected to Scarlet Mimic we observed targeting Tibetan groups from 2013­\n\n2014, and analyze how the same infrastructure is now being used to host a wave of phishing attacks.\n\nWe conclude with discussion of what may have motivated this change in tactics, and provide\n\nrecommendations for targeted users.\n\n## Part 1: Scarlet Mimic Campaigns against Tibetans\n\n[According to Palo Alto Networks, Scarlet Mimic has been active for at least four years. The attack](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/)\n\ngroup primarily uses well­known vulnerabilities and the “FakeM” malware family first reported by\n\n[Trend Micro in 2013, which attempts to disguise its malicious traffic as commonly used protocols.](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-fakem-rat.pdf)\n\nA cluster of Scarlet Mimic attacks used the FakeM Custom SSL variant and were deployed on C2\n\n[infrastructure that relied on free domains provided by Securepoint, a German dynamic DNS service.](https://www.spdns.de/)\n\nDynamic DNS services typically allow anyone to make free subdomains from a main domain. In the\n\ncase of Securepoint, this service allows anyone to make free subdomains from *.firewall‐\n\n[gateway.com, *.my‐gateway.org, *.myfirewall.org and others. We speculate that the attackers](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/pull/65/files?diff=split)\n\nmay have selected this particular service, because the domains have innocuous technical names\n\n(e.g, *.firewall‐gateway.com) that may escape casual scrutiny. These kinds of domains can\n\nchange ownership over time and may be shared by many unrelated users, which can also make\n\nanalysis more challenging.\n\nOur analysis of attacks against the Tibetan community reveals a series of campaigns active from\n\n2013 to 2014 using the FakeM Custom SSL variant and dynamic DNS infrastructure that is linked to\n\nScarlet Mimic. These malware samples are described in detail in the Palo Alto Networks Scarlet\n\nMimic report. Through our engagement with the targeted groups, we provide further context that\n\ndemonstrates the level of social engineering and targeting put into the attacks. Understanding this\n\ncontext provides insights into the attackers’ tactics, including their later pivot to phishing campaigns.\n\n## Campaign 1\n\n\n-----\n\nwas sent to the internal mailing list for a steering committee of a Tibetan NGO, and was highly\n\ncustomized. The message spoofed the e­mail of the NGO’s director, and demonstrated familiarity\n\nwith the internal workings of the organization. Under the pretext of an updated strategic plan, the e­\n\nmail encouraged recipients to open the attached document titled “[Organization Name] Updated\n\nStrategic Plan.doc”\n\nFrom: [Redacted]\n\nDate: 03 Jul 2013\n\nSubject: Re: [Steering Committee] conclusions to Strategic Plan Review\n\nTo: [Redacted]\n\nDear Steering Committee Members, Thanks everyone for all of the good suggestions! Here is the\n\nUpdated Strategic Plan and we’re looking forward to more comments please!\n\n[Redacted signature]\n\nThe malicious attachment installs the file pshvb.exe with the MD5 hash:\n\n\n8b83fc5d3a6a80281269f9e337fe3fff\n\n\nThis hash matches a FakeM Custom SSL variant sample described in the Palo Alto Networks report.\n\nThe malware connected to a C2 server on the domain: news[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com. At the\n\ntime of the attack this domain resolved to the IP address 109[.]169[.]77[.]230, and was hosted\n\n[on UK­based virtual server provider iomart](http://www.iomart.com/)\n\n## Campaign 2\n\nWe observed the attackers again on March 19, 2014 when they targeted a different Tibetan group.\n\nThe attack masqueraded as a message from a representative of the Office of His Holiness the Dalai\n\nLama (HHDL) in Taiwan and contained an attachment that referenced an upcoming visit of HHDL to\n\nJapan.\n\nSimilar to the previous attack, the attachment dropped the FakeM Custom SSL variant, and is also\n\nreferenced in the Palo Alto Networks report. In this case the malware connected to the C2\n\ndetail43[.]myfirewall[.]org, which at the time of the attack also resolved to the same IP\n\naddress as the previous campaign, 109[.]169[.]77[.]230.\n\nAnother set of attacks spanned from June to July 2014 targeting the same Tibetan group and a\n\nnumber of Tibetan journalists. The Tibetan group received multiple e­mails purportedly from NGOs\n\nworking on Tibetan issues, while the journalists were enticed by a promise of survey results on\n\nTibetan political attitudes.\n\nAll of these attacks used the same FakeM Custom SSL variant and connected to the C2\n\nsys[.]firewall‐gateway[.]net, which resolved to 95[.]154[.]195[.]159 at the time of the\n\nattack and was also hosted on UK server provider iomart. See Figure 1 for an overview of the\n\ncampaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Part 2: Old Infrastructure, New Tricks\n\nThroughout November 2015 we observed Scarlet Mimic’s C2 infrastructure being repurposed to host\n\nphishing attacks against the Tibetan community. The phishing campaign we identified consisted of\n\ntargeted emails with email senders and messages that are relevant to the Tibetan community. The\n\nemails appeared to share links to documents or videos on Google Drive or video sharing websites.\n\n## The Phishing Campaign\n\nUsing the example of an e­mail sent to Tibetan journalists, we can demonstrate how a typical\n\nphishing attack in the campaign works. The e­mail masquerades as sent by a Tibetan activist,\n\ndescribes a video on China and Tibet, and shares a link to what appears to be a video sharing site.\n\nFrom: Dorjee Tenzin <tenzinsft@gmail.com>\n\nDate: 22 Nov 2015\n\nSubject: How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – video\n\nTo: [Redacted]\n\nThis video – How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – is short and easy to understand. Must\n\nwatch.\n\nhttp://www.downvids.net/how­china­takes­care­of­tibet­and­tibetans­595657.html\n\nIn fact, the link directs the user to a phishing page:\n\n\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com/serviclogin\n\n\nThe site displays a lookalike to the Google Gmail login page (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of Google login phishing page (left) and authentic Google login as of March 2016 (right).\n\nInterestingly, the login page used by the attackers is slightly outdated. Their version includes both\n\nusername and password prompts on the same page. Google has been using a two­prompt process\n\n[for authentication since May 2015](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/oAsE-6wmaSU)\n\nIf a victim enters their credentials, the data is sent to the attackers via an HTTP POST request that is\n\nformatted as: http://accountgoogle.firewall‐gateway.com/serviclogin/ojkiojr09[.]asp.\n\nAn example of the data that is sent back to attackers is provided in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: A sample of the data sent to the attackers. The Email and Password fields are the most relevant.\n\n### Decoy Content\n\nOnce a user enters their credentials they are redirected to decoy content. In the example attack\n\nagainst Tibetan journalists, if the victim entered their credentials they were re­directed to the video\n\n“How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans” on the video sharing site referenced in the email (see\n\nFigure 4).\n\nFigure 4: Screenshot of destination content.\n\nThe destination content that the user is sent to is determined by a string in the subdirectory of the\n\nURL that has various misspellings of “servicelogin”. In the emails we collected, we found three\n\nsubdirectory variations:\n\nhttp://filegoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com/servicelogin\n\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com/serviclogin\n\n\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com/servicclogin\n\n\nWe speculate that the last part of the URL, “ojkiojr09” in our example URL\n\n(http://accountgoogle.firewall‐gateway.com/serviclogin/ojkiojr09[.]asp) may be a\n\ncampaign code, or a way for the attackers to differentiate on their end who is accessing the phished\n\npage, and the destination content to which they should be forwarded. We see a similar string in\n\nanother of the emails that may be used for this purpose: http://filegoogle[.]firewall‐\n\n\ngateway[.]com/servicelogin/sfwef[.]asp\n\n\n### Phishing Campaign Timeline\n\nWe have observed the campaign active between at least November 9, 2015 to December 18, 2015.\n\nDuring this period we collected three phishing emails sent to Tibetan journalists and NGOs.\n\nMonitoring the URLs that link to the phishing page reveals that the destination content to which the\n\n\n-----\n\nwith messages linked to the new destination content.\n\nFigure 5 provides a timeline for the campaign and shows when emails were received, the original\n\ndestination content provided, and changes to the destination content over time. On December 18 the\n\nservers were up, but no content was being served in reply to logins.\n\nFigure 5: Timeline of phishing campaign (see Appendix A for full details).\n\nWhile we only collected three emails during the span of the campaign, changes in the destination\n\ncontent suggest the timing and theme of further phishing attacks. On November 25, 2015 the\n\ndestination content on URLs 1 and 2 were both changed to climate change­related content.\n\nThe content redirected from URL 1 was changed to a public Google Drive folder that contained\n\ncampaign materials on climate change from a Tibetan NGO. The content redirected from URL 2 was\n\nchanged to a website used to organize the Global Climate March (globalclimatemarch.org), a\n\ndemonstration to raise climate change awareness.\n\nThe climate change theme is significant. During this period Tibetan organizations were taking part in\n\nadvocacy to raise awareness on climate change in Tibetan areas in anticipation of the United Nations\n\nConference on Climate Change held in Paris, France from November 30 to December 12, 2015.\n\nSee Appendix A for details on each attack and destination content change.\n\n## Overlap with Scarlet Mimic\n\nSimilar to the previous FakeM Custom SSL campaigns, the phishing pages used domains provided\n\nby Securepoint’s dynamic DNS service:\n\nfilegoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com\n\naccountgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com\n\n\ndetail43[.]myfirewall[.]org\n\n\nSimilar to the previous malware campaigns, all three of these domains are also hosted on iomart.\n\nWe observed the first phishing campaign using this infrastructure in early November 2015. During\n\nthis time, two of the domains (filegoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com,\n\naccountgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com) resolved to the IP address 95[.]154[.]195[.]171.\n\n[We further investigated this IP address through passive DNS data sources in PassiveTotal and found](https://www.passivetotal.org/)\n\nadditional domains that match the “firewall‐gateway” naming scheme observed in the Scarlet\n\nMimic malware campaigns:\n\naccountsgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com\n\naccounts‐google[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com\n\nt l [ ]fi ll t [ ]\n\n\n-----\n\nfirewallupdate[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com\n\nfirewallupdate[.]firewall‐gateway[.]net\n\n\ndrivgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com\n\n\nTable 1 shows connections between domains identified by Palo Alto Networks, domains we see used\n\nas C2 servers in the previous malware campaigns, and relations to servers hosting the recent\n\nphishing campaigns. The overlap in domains and passive DNS records shows the infrastructure\n\nrelationships between the previous Scarlet Mimic campaigns and recent phishing campaigns.\n\n\n**Citlab**\n**ASN Name** **IP Address** **Domain**\n\n**Seen**\n\n\n**FakeM**\n\n**Custom**\n\n\nHOL­GR hellas online Electronic\n\nCommunications S.A.,GR\n\nIOMART­AS Iomart,GB\n\n\ndrivgoogle.firewall­\n5.54.19.17\n\ngateway.com\n\n\nX\n\n\nadmin.spdns.org X\n\nfirefox.spdns.de X\n\n\nintersecurity.firewall­\n\ngateway.com\n\n\nX\n\n\n78.129.252.159\n\n\nkaspersky.firewall­\n\ngateway.net\n\n\nX\n\n\nkissecurity.firewall­\n\n\ngateway.net X\n\nopero.spdns.org X\n\n87.117.229.109 **detail43.myfirewall.org** X X\n\n\naccountgoogle.firewall­\n\ngateway.com\n\n\nX\n\n\naccountsgoogle.firewall­\n\ngateway.com\n\n\nX\n\n\naccountsgoogles.firewall­\n\ngateway.net\n\n\nX\n\n\nfilegoogle.firewall­\n\ngateway.com\n\n\nX\n\n\n95.154.195.171\n\n\nfirewallupdate.firewall­\n\ngateway.com\n\n\nX\n\n\n-----\n\n**gateway.net**\n\n\ngooglefile.firewall­\n\ngateway.net\n\n\nX\n\nX X\n\nX X\n\n\n**news.firewall­**\n\n**gateway.com**\n\n\n**sys.firewall­**\n\n**gateway.net**\n\n\n109.169.40.172 economy.spdns.de X\n\n\nLGI­UPC Liberty Global\n\nOperations B.V.,AT\n\n\nmail.firewall­\n46.127.56.109\n\ngateway.com\n\n\nX\n\n\nNEWMEDIAEXPRESS­AS­AP\n\nNewMedia Express Pte Ltd.\n\nSingapore Web Hosting Service\n\nProvider,SG\n\n\n192.253.251.118 aaa123.spdns.de X\n\n\nTable 1: Comparison of domains and hosting seen by Citizen Lab (labelled “Citizen Lab Seen”) and\n\nthe FakeM Custom SSL cluster described in the Scarlet Mimic report (labelled “FakeM Custom”).\n\n## Evidence of Other Campaigns\n\nWe leveraged patterns in the configuration of the phishing servers to identity additional servers. The\n\nIP address 95[.]154[.]195[.]171 that we saw previously was using Microsoft IIS web server\n\nversion 6 and was configured to forbid access to the top level of the URL path. Using the search\n\n[engine Shodan we scanned all servers on iomart that ran IIS 6 and forbid access to the root url path](https://www.shodan.io/)\n\nwith the query:\n\nport:80 IIS/6.0 forbidden title:Error \"Content‐Length: 218\" country:\"GB\" org:iomart\n\nFor all the matched servers we sent a query to the URL path (/servicelogin/ojkiojr09.asp),\n\nwhich is used to redirect victims to destination content in the phish attacks. The purpose of this query\n\nwas to to determine if any other servers would forward us to content in the same manner we had\n\nobserved in the attacks.\n\nWe found one other IP address (87[.]117[.]229[.]109) on iomart that responded to this query.\n\n[We observed this server responding with a redirect to an article by Radio Free Asia regarding the](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/detained-07172015135210.html)\n\narrest of the aunt of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a Tibetan monk who recently died while in a Chinese\n\nprison.\n\nWe saw this content active from November 30, 2015 to December 3, 2015, when the forward link\n\n\n-----\n\n[We used PassiveTotal to identify which domains pointed to both IP addresses from March 2015 to](http://passivetotal.org/)\n\nDecember 2015 and saw an overlap across three domains:\n\n\nsys[.]firewall‐gateway[.]net\n\n\nnews[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com\n\n\nfirewallupdate[.]firewall‐gateway[.]net\n\n\nThe domain: firewallupdate[.]firewall‐gateway[.]net was referenced in the Palo Alto\n\nNetwork report and pointed to both the IPs we identified at different times (see Figure 6).\n\nFigure 6: Domain overlap between two iomart IPs in the phishing infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally this new IP had two additional domains that were also using the Securepoint dynamic\n\nDNS service: updata[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com and accounts­google[.]firewall­gateway[.]com.\n\nWe saw one of the domains: detail43[.]myfirewall[.]org used as a C2 server for an attack in\n\nthe previously described Scarlet Mimic campaign from 2014.\n\n## Why the Shift to Phishing?\n\nWhen Scarlet Mimic shifted tactics, they failed to properly compartmentalize their phishing and\n\nmalware operations, relying on known C2 infrastructure for the new phishing campaigns. Although\n\nthey tried different attack vectors they still fell back on old habits and resources that could be\n\nleveraged by analysts. Monitoring the infrastructure enabled us to track the campaigns over time and\n\ndemonstrates the importance of infrastructure analysis for security researchers.\n\nThe shift to phishing campaigns is significant, as Palo Alto Networks only observed document­based\n\n[malware attacks.[1] Importantly, Scarlet Mimic may be continuing to conduct as­yet unreported](https://citizenlab.org/2016/03/shifting-tactics/#f1)\n\nmalware campaigns on other infrastructure. There are a number of potential explanations for this\n\nchange.\n\nThe phishing campaigns targeted multiple organizations and individuals in the Tibetan community.\n\nMany of these groups act as distributed networks, with staff members and collaborators around the\n\nworld. The attackers are, therefore, not necessarily targeting compromise of office networks, but\n\nrather social networks. Credential phishing is a potentially more efficient means of gaining access to\n\nthese networks than document­based malware.\n\nIn addition, the promotion of behavioral changes in the Tibetan community and the use of document­\n\nsharing platforms such as Google Docs over email attachments may have put pressure on attackers’\n\ntactics and led them to experiment with simpler, but potentially effective vectors, such as phishing. In\n\n[other attacks against the Tibetan community over the past year we have also seen malware sent via](https://citizenlab.org/2015/06/targeted-attacks-against-tibetan-and-hong-kong-groups-exploiting-cve-2014-4114/)\n\nGoogle Drive links in targeted emails. The Scarlet Mimic phishing campaigns add further evidence\n\nthat attackers are attempting to leverage the wide use and trust of Google applications in the Tibetan\n\ncommunity\n\n\n-----\n\ntoolkit play a role. Out of the 74 FakeM sample hashes provided in the Palo Alto Networks Scarlet\n\nMimic report, 61 are available on VirusTotal. When the samples were first submitted to VirusTotal\n\nsome had zero detections and an overall average detection rate of 38 percent. Following the\n\npublication of the Palo Alto Networks report the average detection increased to 54 percent. The\n\ncurrent average detection rate is 71 percent, the highest is 80 percent (46 / 57 antivirus scanners),\n\nand the lowest is 51 percent (23 / 45 antivirus scanners). These current detection rates may make\n\nthe malware that the attackers used in past attacks less reliable for successful infection. While the\n\nattackers could be pivoting to new, less detectable malware, simple phishing attacks may also involve\n\nless effort and achieve higher success against journalists and NGO targets.\n\nFinally, we cannot rule out that converting burned or low­utility command and control servers\n\nto phishing might also be intentional down­cycling of infrastructure, before it is discarded. Phishing,\n\nin other words, may be the last stop before domains and servers that are losing value are finally\n\ngiven up.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Tibetan community has been targeted by sophisticated, persistent attackers for over a decade.\n\nScarlet Mimic is just one of these attack groups, and over the years they have demonstrated deep\n\nfamiliarity and inside knowledge of the Tibetan groups they target. They have also shown themselves\n\nto be adaptable and responsive to changes in the security behaviors of their targets.\n\nTheir most recent turn to phishing seems to reflect this adaptability (although we leave open the\n\npossibility that malware attacks are continuing, using other infrastructure). A number of factors may\n\nhave played a role in this transition, including an increase in certain security behaviors within the\n\nTibetan community (such as not opening or sending attachments), and increasing rates of detection\n\nby antivirus products.\n\nThe information targeted by this group is sensitive, and in the hands of a well­resourced adversary,\n\nsuch as the sponsor of Scarlet Mimic, could cause harm to the safety and security of individuals in\n\nTibet. The extracted information could also be used in support of efforts to frustrate and isolate\n\npolitical groups in the Tibetan diaspora.\n\nPhishing relies on tricking users into entering credentials. In this case, there are several telltale signs\n\n(such as a slightly outdated Gmail login phishing page) that may suggest to potential victims that\n\nsomething is “not quite right.” However, there are also a number of tools and tactics available to\n\nusers in the Tibetan community and beyond to stay safe online We describe several of these below.\n\n## What Can Targeted Users Do?\n\n**Tools**\n\n**Use two­factor authentication This feature is available on many popular email and social**\n\n\n-----\n\ntwo­factor authentication means you have to enter your password as well as a code provided by a\n\ntext, app, or security key to access your account.

A SWC is an attack in which attackers compromise normally trusted websites and serve](http://community.websense.com/blogs/securitylabs/archive/2013/08/16/tibetan-compromise.aspx)\n\nmalicious code to specific visitors. In this case, the attackers used the Tibetan website to serve an\n\n[Internet Explorer vulnerability (CVE­2012­4969) that was patched in 2012. This attack used the](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4969)\n\ndomain mail[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com as a C2, which is from the same dynamic DNS service\n\nas the FakeM SSL Custom variant attacks.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis research was supported by the John D. and Catherine T.

The\n\nmessage purported to contain a link to a document with information on a controversial Buddhist sect\n\n[known as Dorje Shugden or Dolgyal, which has been involved in protests against the Dalai Lama.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorje_Shugden)\n\nFrom: Choephel Tenzin <tenzinch128@gmail.com>\n\nDate: Mon Nov 9 2015\n\n\n-----\n\nTo: [Redacted]\n\nFile regarding Dolgyal.\n\nWho is demonstrating against the Dalai Lama.doc\n\nThe link “Who is demonstrating against the Dalai Lama.doc” actually goes to\n\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com/servicclogin. When we first checked this\n\nlink on November 13, the page was down and we therefore do not know what the original destination\n\ncontent was for this attack.\n\n### Destination Content Switch\n\nOn November 25 the link was active and the destination content was a public Google Drive folder that\n\ncontained campaign materials on climate change from a Tibetan NGO. The climate change theme is\n\nsignificant, as during this period Tibetan organizations were taking part in advocacy to raise\n\nawareness on climate change in Tibetan areas in anticipation of the United Nations Conference on\n\nClimate Change held in Paris, France from November 30 to December 12, 2015.\n\n## Phishing Attack 2\n\nThe second phishing attack was sent to Tibetan journalists on November 22, 2015.\n\nIn this case the email was made to appear to come from a Tibetan activist, describes a video on\n\nChina and Tibet, and shares a link to what appears to be a video sharing site, but is actually\n\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall‐gateway[.]com/serviclogin.\n\nFrom: Dorjee Tenzin <tenzinsft@gmail.com>\n\nDate: 22 Nov 2015\n\nSubject: How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – video\n\nTo: [Redacted]\n\nThis video – How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – is short and easy to understand. Must\n\nwatch.\n\nhttp://www.downvids.net/how­china­takes­care­of­tibet­and­tibetans­595657.html\n\nOn November 22, 2015, if users entered their credentials into the Google login phishing page they\n\nwould be redirected to the video described in the email.\n\n### Destination Content Switch\n\nOn November 25, 2015, the destination content was changed to a website used to organize the\n\nGlobal Climate March (globalclimatemarch.org), a demonstration to raise climate change\n\nawareness around the United Nations Conference on Climate Change.\n\nThe November 25, 2015 destination content change shares the timing and theme of the change we\n\n\n-----\n\nchange themes around November 25, 2015.\n\n## Phishing Attack 3\n\nOn November 23, 2015, an email appearing to be from the Press Officer of the Central Tibetan\n\nAdministration was sent to multiple Tibetan journalists, activists, and NGO staff members.\n\nFrom: Tsering Wangchuk <euhrdesk.diir@gmail.com>\n\nDate: 23 Nov 2015\n\nSubject: Press Invitation\n\nTo: [Redacted]\n\nPress Invitation\n\nThe media is cordially invited by the Election Commission of the Central\n\nTibetan Administration its press conference regarding the upcoming Sikyong\n\nand Tibetan final elections at Lhakpa Tsering hall, DIIR, on November 27, 2015, at 10:00 AM.\n\nPress Invitation.pdfTsering Wangchuk\n\nPress Officer\n\n+91 8679208465\n\nwww.tibet.net\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pressofficerct\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lhuabu\n\nDIIR, CENTRAL TIBETAN ADMINISTRATION\n\nThe “Press Invitation.pdf” link actually goes to http://filegoogle[.]firewall‐\n\ngateway[.]com/servicelogin. On November 23, when the email was sent, if the user entered their\n\ncredentials into the phishing page they would be redirected to a Google Doc containing a copy of an\n\nop­ed written by the Central Tibetan Administration on climate change. The destination content and\n\nthe email message do not match in this case, which may be evidence of the attackers neglecting to\n\nswitch out content from a previous campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Destination Content Switch\n\nOn November 26, 2015, the destination content to which the phishing page redirected users was\n\nchanged to a Google Drive document that provides the program for a visit to Dharamsala, India by\n\nChilean Parliamentarians.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B: Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Scarlet Mimic Malware Campaign 1\n\n**Binaries**\n\n**MD5: fef27f432e0ae8218143bc410fda340e**\n\n**Command and Control Servers**\n\n\nnews.firewall‐gateway[.]com\n\n\n### Scarlet Mimic Malware Campaign 2\n\n Attack 1\n\n**File attachments**\n\n**Filename:20140317144336097.DOC**\n\n**MD5:** 3b869c8e23d66ad0527882fc79ff7237\n\n**Binaries**\n\n**Filename:** cghnt.exe\n\n**MD5:** 1bf438b5744db73eea58379a3b9f30e5\n\n\n-----",
