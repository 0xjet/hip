Here, we focus on the methods used by the group to attack its targets,\nand on who these targets are.\n\nThe key points described in this first installment are the following:\n\n- During the Sednit phishing campaigns more than 1,000 high-profile individuals involved\nin Eastern European politics were attacked, including some Ukrainian leaders, NATO officials,\nand Russian political dissidents\n\n- The Sednit operators launched their phishing attacks on weekdays, and at times\n\ncorresponding to office hours in the time zone UTC+3\n\n- The Sednit group developed its own exploit kit — a first for an espionage group — deploying\na surprisingly high number of 0-day exploits\n\n- The Sednit group developed particular first-stage malware in order to bypass network\n\nsecurity measures implemented by compromised organizations\n\n[For any inquiries related to this whitepaper, contact us at: threatintel@eset.com](mailto:threatintel%40eset.com?subject=Sednit%20whitepaper)\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n##### Introduction\n\n###### The Sednit Group\n\nThe Sednit group — variously also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Pawn Storm, STRONTIUM\nand Tsar Team — is a group of attackers operating since 2004 if not earlier, whose main objective\nis to steal confidential information from specific targets. Over the past two years, this group’s activity\nhas increased significantly, with numerous attacks against government departments and embassies\nall over the world.\n\nAmong their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee [1],\nthe German parliament [2] and the French television network TV5Monde _[3]. Moreover, the Sednit_\ngroup has a special interest in Eastern Europe, where it regularly targets individuals and organizations\ninvolved in geopolitics.\n\nOne of the striking characteristics of the Sednit group is its ability to come up with brand-new 0-day [4]\nvulnerabilities regularly. In 2015, the group exploited no fewer than six 0-day vulnerabilities, as shown\nin Figure 1.\n\n\n**CVE-2015-3043**\nFlash\n\n**CVE-2015-1701**\nWindows LPE\n\n\n**CVE-2015-2590**\nJava\n\n**CVE-2015-4902**\nJava click-to-play bypass\n\n\n**CVE-2015-7645**\nFlash\n\n\n**APR** **MAY** **JUN** **JUL** **AUG** **SEP** **OCT**\n\n**CVE-2015-2424**\nOffice RCE\n\nFigure 1. Timeline of 0-day vulnerabilities exploited by the Sednit group in 2015\n\nThis high number of 0-day exploits suggests significant resources available to the Sednit group, either\nbecause the group members have the skills and time to find and weaponize these vulnerabilities,\nor because they have the budget to purchase the exploits.\n\nAlso, over the years the Sednit group has developed a large software ecosystem to perform\nits espionage activities. The diversity of this ecosystem is quite remarkable; it includes dozens\nof custom programs, with many of them being technically advanced, like the Xagent and Sedreco\nmodular backdoors (described in the second part of this whitepaper), or the Downdelph bootkit\nand rootkit (described in the third part of this whitepaper).\n\nWe present the results of ESET’s two-year pursuit of the Sednit group, during which we uncovered\nand analyzed many of their operations. We split our publication into three independent parts:\n\n1. _“Part 1: Approaching the Target” describes the kinds of targets the Sednit group is after,_\nand the methods used to attack them. It also contains a detailed analysis of the group’s\nmost-used reconnaissance malware.\n\n2. _“Part 2: Observing the Comings and Goings” describes the espionage toolkit deployed_\non some target computers, plus a custom network tool used to pivot within\nthe compromised organizations.\n\n3. _“Part 3: A Mysterious Downloader” describes a surprising operation run by the Sednit group,_\n\nduring which a lightweight Delphi downloader was deployed with advanced persistence\nmethods, including both a bootkit and a rootkit.\n\nEach of these parts comes with the related indicators of compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n###### The First Part of the Trilogy\n\nFigure 2 shows the main components that the Sednit group has used over the last two years,\nwith their interrelationships. It should not be considered as a complete representation of their arsenal,\nwhich also includes numerous small custom tools.\n\n**ATTACK** **FIRST-STAGE** **SECOND-STAGE** **PIVOT**\n**METHODS** **MALWARE** **MALWARE** **MALWARE**\n\n**Seduploader** **Seduploader** **Sedreco** **Sedreco**\n\n**Xtunnel**\n\ndropper payload dropper payload\n\nSedkit\n\n**Usbstealer**\n\nEmail\nattachments\n\n**Downdelph** **Xagent**\n\nFake webmail\nlogin panels\n\nEn Route En Route En Route\nwith Sednit with Sednit with Sednit\n**Part 1** **Part 3** **Part 2**\n\nFigure 2. Main attack methods and malware used by the Sednit group since 2014,\nand how they are related\n\nWe divide Sednit’s software into three categories: the first-stage software serves for reconnaissance\nof a newly compromised host, then comes the second-stage software intended to spy on machines\ndeemed interesting, while the pivot software finally allows the operators to reach other computers.\n\nIn this first part, we focus on Sednit’s attack methods. Indeed, having reliable methods\nto compromise the computers of the intended targets with spying malware is one of the most\nimportant parts of a cyber espionage operation.\n\nThe components on which we focus in this first part are outlined in Figure 2, which includes\nthe attack methods employed and the first-stage malware we call Seduploader, composed\nof a dropper and its associated payload.\n\nAll the components shown in Figure 2 are described in this whitepaper,\nwith the exception of Usbstealer, a tool to exfiltrate data from air-gapped\nmachines that we have already described at WeLiveSecurity [5]. Recent\nversions have been documented by Kaspersky Labs [6] as well.\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n\n|Seduploader Seduploader Sedreco Sedreco Xtunnel dropper payload dropper payload Sedkit Usbstealer Email attachments Downdelph Xagent Fake webmail login panels En Route En Route En Route with Sednit with Sednit with Sednit Part 1 Part 3 Part 2|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n\n\n**SECOND-STAGE**\n**MALWARE**\n\n**Sedreco** **Sedreco**\ndropper payload\n\n**Xagent**\n\nEn Route\nwith Sednit\n**Part 2**\n\n\n**ATTACK**\n**METHODS**\n\nSedkit\n\nEmail\nattachments\n\nFake webmail\nlogin panels\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n###### Attribution\n\nOne might expect this reference whitepaper to add new information about attribution. A lot has\nbeen said to link the Sednit group to some Russian entities [7], and we do not intend to add anything\nto this discussion.\n\nPerforming attribution in a serious, scientific manner is a hard problem that is out of scope\nof ESET’s mission. As security researchers, what we call “the Sednit group” is merely a set of software\nand the related network infrastructure, which we can hardly correlate with any specific organization.\n\nNevertheless, our intensive investigation of the Sednit group has allowed us to collect numerous\nindicators of the language spoken by its developers and operators, as well as their areas of interest,\nas we will explain in this whitepaper.\n\n###### Publication Strategy\n\nBefore entering the core content of this whitepaper, we would like to discuss our publication strategy.\nIndeed, as security researchers, two questions we always find difficult to answer when we write\nabout an espionage group are “when to publish?”, and “how to make our publication useful to those tasked with\n_defending against such attacks?”._\n\nThere were several detailed reports on the Sednit group published in 2014, like the Operation\nPawn Storm report from Trend Micro [8] and the APT28 report from FireEye [9]. But since then\nthe public information regarding this group mainly came in the form of blog posts describing specific\ncomponents or attacks. In other words, no public attempts have been made to present the big\npicture on the Sednit group since 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sednit group’s activity significantly increased, and its arsenal differs from\nthose described in previous whitepapers.\n\nTherefore, our intention here is to provide a detailed picture of the Sednit group’s activities over\nthe past two years. Of course, we have only partial visibility into those activities, but we believe\nthat we possess enough information to draw a representative picture, which should in particular\nhelp defenders to handle Sednit compromises.\n\nWe tried to follow a few principles in order to make our whitepaper useful to the various types\nof readers:\n\n- Keep it readable: while we provide detailed technical descriptions, we have tried to make\nthem readable, without sacrificing precision. This is the reason we decided to split our whitepaper\ninto three independent parts, in order to make such a large amount of information easily\ndigestible. We also have refrained from mixing indicators of compromise with the text.\n\n- Help the defenders: we provide indicators of compromise (IOC) to help detect current Sednit\n\ninfections, and we group them in the IOC section and on ESET’s GitHub account [10]. Hence,\nthe reader interested only in these IOC can act directly, and find more context\nin the whitepaper afterwards.\n\n- Reference previous work: a high profile group such as Sednit is tracked by numerous\n\nentities. As with any research work, our investigation stands on the shoulders of the previous\npublications. We have referenced them appropriately, to the best of our knowledge.\n\n- Document also what we do not understand: we still have numerous open questions\n\nregarding Sednit, and we highlight them in our text. We hope this will encourage fellow\nmalware researchers to help complete the puzzle.\n\nWe did our best to follow these principles, but there may be cases where we missed our aim.\n[We encourage readers to provide feedback at threatintel@eset.com, and we will update](mailto:threatintel%40eset.com?subject=)\nthe whitepaper accordingly.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n##### Who Are the Targets?\n\nIn order to set the scene for the Sednit group, we will first take a look at who their targets are.\nIndeed, knowing the targets of such a group allows us to get some idea of their motivations,\ntheir level of sophistication, and the interests they serve.\n\nIn a number of publicized cases high-profile entities have supposedly been attacked by the Sednit\ngroup, such as:\n\n- The American Democratic National Committee, in May 2016 [1]\n\n- The German parliament, in May 2015 [2]\n\n- The French television network TV5Monde, in April 2015 [3]\n\nSuch high-profile cases allow us to draw an initial conclusion: the Sednit group’s objectives\nare connected to international geopolitics, and the group is definitely not “afraid” of targeting\nmajor entities. To continue this reasoning in more depth, we will describe in the next sections\na list of targets for a phishing operation run by the Sednit group in 2015.\n\n###### How Did We Find the Target List?\n\nContext\n\nOne of the common attack methods used by the Sednit group — see Figure 2 — is spearphishing\n(sending targeted phishing emails) to steal webmail account credentials. To do so, the group\ncreates fake login pages for various webmail services, and lures the targets into visiting the fake\npage and entering their credentials. This attack method was initially documented by Trend Micro [8]\nand PwC [11].\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nFor example, Figure 3 shows a Sednit phishing email targeting Gmail users.\n\nFigure 3. Example of phishing email sent to attempt to steal Gmail credentials.\nThe hyperlink actually points to a domain used for phishing\n\nThe link in this email points in reality to a Sednit domain name. If potential victims click on it,\nthey will be redirected to a fake Gmail login panel, as shown in Figure 4. Hence, they will get the\nimpression that they have to log in again in order to access the document mentioned in the email.\nThose who fall prey by entering their credentials will be redirected to the legitimate Google Drive\nwebpage, while their credentials will be collected by Sednit.\n\nFigure 4. Fake Gmail login panel. Target’s name and email address have been redacted\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nAn important point here is that the fake login panel displays the targets’ names and email addresses,\nto reinforce the illusion they have been logged out from their real Gmail accounts.\n\nThe fake webmail login panels deployed by Sednit are usually just a copy\nof the real login panel source.\n\nThe Operators’ Mistake\n\nDuring one of these phishing campaigns against webmail users, the operators used Bitly [12] to shorten\nthe URLs contained in the emails. To do so, they created a few accounts on Bitly, and used each\nof them to shorten multiple phishing URLs. Luckily enough for us, one of those Bitly accounts was\nset as “public”, which allows everyone to see the list of URLs that were shortened by this account,\nwith the exact time at which they were shortened.\n\nThe public profile feature has been removed from Bitly [13], and hence the list\nis no longer available.\n\nInterestingly, each URL that was shortened contained the email address and the name of the target.\nHaving this information in the URL allowed the fake login panel to display them easily, as shown\nin Figure 4, rather than requiring an instance of the login panel for each target. An example\nof a URL that was shortened is shown below:\n\n```\nhttp://login.accoounts-google.com/\nurl/?continue=cGFyZXBreWl2QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==&df=UGFraXN0YW4rRW1iYXNzeStLeWl2&tel=1\n\n```\n\nHere, the continue parameter contains parepkyiv@gmail.com encoded in base64, while\nthe df parameter contains Pakistan+Embassy+Kyiv. Therefore, it is possible to identify the target\nprecisely from a URL that was shortened, in this case the Pakistan Embassy in Kiev.\n\n###### What Is in the List?\n\nThe list contains around 4,400 URLs that were shortened between 16th of March 2015 and 14th\nof September 2015. Assuming that the time at which a URL was shortened corresponds roughly\nto the moment when the corresponding phishing email was sent, it allows us to create a relatively\naccurate timeline of the events related to these phishing attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n**Weekends**\n\n\nFigure 5. Number of URLs that were shortened per day during the first two months\n\nThere were regular peaks in the number of URLs that were shortened, usually Monday or Friday,\nprobably corresponding to the launch of new phishing campaigns. Also, there is almost no activity\nduring the weekends indicating that the operators are likely to work only on weekdays.\n\n\nSecondly, the same target may appear in several URLs, probably corresponding to repeated phishing\nattempts. The list contains 1,888 unique target email addresses, most of them being Gmail addresses.\nFigure 6 shows the number of times the targets were attacked.\n\n**1000**\n\n**800**\n\n**600**\n\n**400**\n\n**200**\n\n\n**0**\n**1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6** **7**\n\n\n**Number of phishing attempts**\n\nFigure 6. Number of times targets were attacked\n\n\nMore than half of the targets were attacked only once, and in most of these cases the corresponding\nshortened URL was clicked at least once, according to the Bitly statistics. On the other hand,\nthe others targets have been attacked several times during the six months of data, with a maximum\nof seven attempts against nine of them. Most of the corresponding shortened URLs were not visited.\nIn other words, the targets are regularly attacked until an attempt to phish succeeds, and for more\nthan half of the targets one attempt was enough.\n\nThe number of clicks on a Bitly-shortened URL is publicly available,\nby appending a “+” to the shortened URL, with the countries from which those\nclicks originated. Nevertheless, one can not know whether\na shortened URL was visited by the intended target, or someone else.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nFinally, since we know the exact time when a URL was shortened, we can display the hour\nof the day when it happened, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n**800**\n\n**700**\n\n**600**\n\n**500**\n\n**400**\n\n**300**\n\n**200**\n\n**100**\n\n\n**0**\n**0** **1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8** **9** **10** **11** **12** **13** **14** **15** **16** **17** **18** **19** **20** **21** **22** **23**\n\n**Hour of day (UTC)**\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|Col22|Col23|Col24|Col25|Col26|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nFigure 7. Number of URLs that were shortened per hour of the day\n\nInterestingly, the distribution of the hours matches the working hours from 9AM to 5PM in the\nUTC+3 time zone, with sometimes some activity in the evening. This may indicate that the operators\nwork from this time zone [14].\n\n\n###### What Kind of Targets?\n\nAs the list contains mostly Gmail addresses, the majority of the targeted emails belong to individuals.\nNevertheless, the following organizations also have Gmail addresses that were targeted:\n\n\n\n- Embassies belonging to Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, Djibouti, India, Iraq, North Korea,\n\nKyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Myanmar, Pakistan, South Africa, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates,\nUzbekistan and Zambia\n\n\n\n- Ministries of Defense in Argentina, Bangladesh, South Korea, Turkey and Ukraine\n\nRegarding the individuals targeted, here are a few of their positions that are typical of the list:\n\n\n\n- Political leaders and heads of police of Ukraine\n\n- Members of NATO institutions\n\n\n\n- Members of the People’s Freedom Party, a Russian liberal democratic political party [15]\n\n- Russian political dissidents\n\n\n\n- “Shaltay Boltai”, an anonymous Russian group known to release private emails of Russian\n\npoliticians [16]\n\n\n\n- Journalists located in Eastern Europe\n\n- Academics visiting Russian universities\n\n\n\n- Chechen organizations\n\nOverall, most of the targets we could identify are related by the fact that they all share the same\nstandpoint in the current political situation in Eastern Europe.\n\n\nWhile this list only provides a partial view of the Sednit group’s targets, another list was analyzed\nby Trend Micro, with similar findings [17].\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n###### Conclusion\n\nThe Sednit group targets a lot of individuals and organizations, with a particular focus on Eastern\nEurope, as shown by our analysis of one of their phishing targets lists.\n\nMoreover, the Sednit operators launched their phishing attacks on weekdays, and at times\ncorresponding to office hours in the time zone UTC+3.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n##### Attack Methods\n\nIn this section, we will describe the two main attack methods used by the Sednit group to deploy\nits malicious software. We already discussed the third attack method — fake webmail login\npanels — in the previous section.\n\nThe first method is to lure the target into opening an email attachment, while the second one relies\non the target visiting a website containing a custom exploit kit. In both cases, the lure itself is usually\na phishing email.\n\n###### Email Attachments\n\nAs with many other cyber espionage actors, sending targeted phishing emails with malicious\nattachments is one of the main attack vectors of the Sednit group. Sometimes those attachments\nare simply executables, and no exploits are used. It is, for example, the case for the most recent\ndeployment of Downdelph, a pretty surprising operation that we will describe in the third part\nof this whitepaper.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sednit group also uses exploits, and in some cases even 0-day exploits,\nwith its email attachments. The list of vulnerabilities exploited with this attack method is described\nin Table 1, to the best of our knowledge.\n\n\nTable 1. Vulnerabilities exploited with targeted phishing attachments\n\n\nID Targeted Application Notes Reference\n\nCVE-2009-3129 [18] Microsoft Excel\n\nCVE-2010-3333 [19] Microsoft Office\n\nCVE-2012-0158 [20] Microsoft Office\n\nCVE-2013-2729 [21] Adobe Acrobat Reader\n\n\nCVE-2014-1761 [22] Microsoft Word 0-day at the time\nthe Sednit group used it\n\n\n\n_[23]_\n\n\nCVE-2015-1641 [24] Microsoft Word _[25]_\n\n\nCVE-2015-2424 [26] Microsoft Office 0-day at the time\nthe Sednit group used it\n\n\n\n_[27]_\n\n\nCVE-2016-4117 [78] Adobe Flash Player _[77]_\n\nThe malware usually dropped by those exploits for the last two years has been Seduploader’s\npayload, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nTo illustrate this (well known) attack method, we are now going to briefly describe one particular\nrecent phishing campaign with email attachments from the Sednit group. The email in question was\nsent to targets located in Ukraine in May 2016, and is pictured in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8. Targeted phishing email sent in May 2016\n\nThe subject of the email can be translated to “The aggravation of Russian-EU relations”, while\nthe body roughly translates to:\n\nGood afternoon!\n\nAttached you can find the document on Russia and the European Union\naggravation of relations.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nVasyl Stasiuk.\nUkrainian Academic Union,\n02140, Ukraine, Kiev, Prospect Bazhana Mykoly, 26, office 334\n\nThe address of the “Ukrainian Academic Union” is the correct one [28], while the sender email address\nwas created by the attackers using a freemail provider.\n\nThe RTF attachment exploits the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability [24] to drop two DLLs on the system,\nas described by Prevenity [25]. The first DLL loads each time a Microsoft Office application is executed,\nby registering it under a Windows Registry key named Office Test (see IOC section for details).\nThis DLL in turn loads the second one, which is Seduploader’s payload.\n\nInterestingly, the decoy document was apparently wrongly embedded when building the exploit,\nand thus fails to open. From the attachment name, we can speculate that it was supposed\nto be an RTF version of a news article entitled “Putin Is Being Pushed to Abandon His Conciliatory\nApproach to the West and Prepare for War” [29].\n\nThis particular case is one among a series of attacks using the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability launched\nfrom April 2016 by the Sednit group [30] (more details in the IOC section).\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n###### Sedkit: Exploit Kit for Targeted Attacks\n\nThe second main attack method of the Sednit group is an exploit kit, which we named Sedkit.\nIt was discovered by ESET researchers in September 2014 [23]. At this time, several websites belonging\nto a large financial institution in Poland were modified to automatically redirect the visitors\nto the exploit kit — also known as a watering hole attack [31].\n\nThe workflow of the Sedkit exploit kit has stayed the same since its first appearance. It is shown\nin Figure 9, and described below.\n\n\nAttracting Fingerprinting Delivering\nvisitors exploits\n\nVisitors not selected\n\nFigure 9. **Sedkit workflow**\n\nAttracting Visitors\n\n\nRedirection\nto legitimate\nwebsite\n\n\nAs previously explained, the targets were initially attracted to visit Sedkit via a watering hole\nattacks. But since then, the usual way to lure the targets has been to send targeted phishing\nemails containing a URL pointing to Sedkit. Figure 10 shows an example of such a targeted phishing\nemail from March 2016.\n\nFigure 10. Example of Sedkit targeted phishing email from March 2016\n\nThis email supposedly comes from Stratfor _[32], an intelligence company providing regular reports_\non geopolitics. While the email signature and sender address are correct, the domain name\nin the URL is not — stratfor.com being the legitimate Stratfor domain name. Also, the URI path\nclosely resembles the path of an existing article on the Stratfor website (/weekly/ruthless-and```\nsober-syria), the only difference being the insertion of an ID number (51586), which likely identifies\n\n```\nthe target.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nThe attentive reader may have noticed that the email body text contains a\ntyping mistake: “Sratfor” rather than “Stratfor”, indicating that this text was\nnot copied but manually written by the attackers. Such typing mistakes are\ncommon in Sednit phishing emails.\n\nUsing legitimate news articles as lures, with URLs mimicking the real ones, is the usual way\nof attracting visitors to Sedkit since 2015. Table 2 shows some recent examples of news articles\nmimicked by Sedkit URLs.\n\n\nTable 2. Examples of Sedkit lure news articles\n_(see IOC Section for other Sedkit domain names)_\n\n\nSedkit domain name Legitimate domain name Legitimate news article title\n\ntheguardiannews.org theguardian.com \"West’s military advantage is being eroded,\nreport warns\"\n\nworldpoliticsreviews. worldpoliticsreview.com \"Despite ISIS Attacks, North Korea Remains\ncom the `Varsity` of Global Threats\"\n\nworldpostjournal.com huffingtonpost.com \"Taking War Seriously: a Russia-NATO Showdown\nIs No Longer Just Fiction\"\n\nreuters-press.com reuters.com \"Russia warns Turkey over Aegean warship\nincident\"\n\nunian-news.info unian.info \"Iraq warns of attacks before Paris assault\"\n\nThese news articles not only serve as phishing clickbait, but also as a way to hide the exploitation\nattempt. Indeed, the visitor will be redirected to the real news article after having been exploited.\nVisitors not selected for exploitation, as explained below, will also be redirected. Thus, the target\nwill be left under the impression that the phishing email was actually legitimate.\n\nIn order to be effective, the lure needs to be related to the target’s interests.\nWhile in most cases we analyzed the lure was a news article about geopolitics,\nwe also found a few cases using websites of legitimate Russian companies\nas lures.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nFingerprinting\n\nOnce the target clicks on the phishing URL, the browser is redirected to the Sedkit landing page.\nThe purpose of this page is to build a report of the visitor’s machine. To do so, it contains over\n200 lines of JavaScript code (once beautified) that collect various data.\n\nThe landing page code has stayed the same since March 2015, and an annotated, beautified extract\nis shown below. The JavaScript comments are from the developers, while the variable string_of_json\nis the actual report built as a JSON object.\n\nstring_of_json += \"\\\"timezone\\\"\" + \":\" + getTimeZone() + \",\"; ➊\n\n`for(var prop in navigator) {` ➋\nstring_of_json += ...[REDACTED]...\n```\n   }\n\n```\nstring_of_json += \"\\\"screen\\\":{ \"; ➌\n```\n   for(var prop in screen) {\n\n```\nstring_of_json += ...[REDACTED]...\n```\n   }\n\n```\nstring_of_json += \"\\\"plugins\\\":[ \"; ➍\n//string_of_json += DetectJavaForMSIE();\n```\n   if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf(\"MSIE\") > -1 ||\n\n```\nnavigator.userAgent.indexOf(\"Trident\\/7.0\") > -1)\n{\nstring_of_json += DetectJavaForMSIE();\nstring_of_json += DetectFlashForMSIE();\nstring_of_json += EnumeratePlugins();\n//string_of_json += DetectPdfForMSIE();\n//string_of_json += DetectFlashForMSIE();\n```\n   }\n   else\n\n```\n{\nstring_of_json += EnumeratePlugins();\n```\n   }\n\n```\n➊ Collect the visitor’s time zone\n\n➋ Collect information on the visitor’s browser by enumerating the properties of the JavaScript’s\n```\n  navigator object [33]\n\n```\n➌ Collect information on the visitor’s screen, by enumerating the properties of the JavaScript’s\n```\n  screen object [34]\n\n```\n➍ Collect the list of installed browser plugins, with specific methods in the case of Internet\n\nExplorer 11, and with generic methods otherwise\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nAn example of a Sedkit report produced by the landing page is shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Example of a Sedkit report\n\nThe report is then sent within an HTTP POST request to a URI hardcoded in the landing page code.\nAn example of such a URI is shown below:\n\n\nxmlHttp.open(\"POST\", \"/tlPDH/DoHK/oZx0/65902/9751/?adv=4792&w1=cwXqTKEaLT&p1=14846\n44566&pls=ES3So&c=9780071&w1=676193341&\");\n\n\nThis hardcoded URI path is different each time the landing page is visited, and only works for a limited\namount of time. This probably serves to prevent security researchers from sending specially crafted\nreports directly to Sedkit servers, in order to collect the exploits. The only way (we know of) to visit\nthe exploit kit is to pass through a landing page URL first, which can be difficult due to the limited\ndistribution of the phishing emails containing those URLs. Again, these landing page URLs are active\nfor a short time.\n\nThen, depending on the report, the visitor may receive a suitable exploit, or be redirected\nto the legitimate website the email lure was based on, as shown in Figure 9. Given the amount\nof information contained in the report, the operators can very precisely select the visitors to exploit,\nand those to filter out. The exact logic behind this selection is unknown to us, and remains one\nof the major open questions regarding Sedkit.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nDelivering Exploits\n\nLanding page visitors matching the Sedkit operators’ criteria then receive an exploit suitable\nfor their machines. Since Sedkit’s first appearance, numerous exploits have been added. Table 3\nlists the exploited vulnerabilities we have observed during our tracking of Sedkit.\n\n\nTable 3. **Sedkit exploited vulnerabilities**\n\n\nID Targeted Application Notes Reference\n\nCVE-2013-1347 [35] Internet Explorer 8 _[23]_\n\nCVE-2013-3897 [36] Internet Explorer 8 _[23]_\n\n\nCVE-2014-1510 [37]\n\nCVE-2014-1511 [38]\n\n\nFirefox None\n\n\nCVE-2014-1776 [39] Internet Explorer 11 _[23]_\n\nCVE-2014-6332 [40] Internet Explorer See below\n\n\nN/A MacKeeper OS X cleaning\ntool developed by\na Ukrainian company\n\n\nCVE-2015-2590 [42]\n\nCVE-2015-4902 [43]\n\n\nJava 0-day at the time\nSedkit used it\n\n\nCVE-2015-3043 [45] Adobe Flash 0-day at the time\nSedkit used it\n\nCVE-2015-5119 [47] Adobe Flash Revamped from Hacking\nTeam leaked data\n\nCVE-2015-7645 [49] Adobe Flash 0-day at the time\nSedkit used it\n\n\n\n_[41]_\n\n_[44]_\n\n_[46]_\n\n_[48]_\n\n_[50]_\n\n\nThe end goal of these exploits is to download and execute Sednit malware, usually Seduploader’s\ndropper.\n\nMost of these exploits and their use by Sednit have already been documented, as mentioned\nin the “Reference” column of Table 3. Nevertheless, we will describe the specific case of the\nCVE-2014-6332 vulnerability exploitation, as it is a good example of Sednit’s abilities,\nand to the best of our knowledge has not been documented previously.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2014-6332 was discovered in May 2014 by an IBM X-Force security researcher [51],\nand affected Internet Explorer versions 3 through 11. Roughly summarized, the vulnerability\nis an integer overflow in the Internet Explorer VBScript engine that allowed arbitrary read/write\nin memory.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nSoon after the disclosure, a proof-of-concept was released by a Chinese security researcher [52].\nThe proof-of-concept used the vulnerability to disable Internet Explorer’s “SafeMode”, so that arbitrary\nVBScript code could be executed. Numerous miscreants then integrated revamped versions\nof this proof-of-concept into their toolsets, and the Sednit group was no exception. Indeed,\nin October 2015 a simple revamped version of the original proof-of-concept was added to Sedkit.\n\nBut the Sednit group went one step further in February 2016 by deploying a different exploit\nfor this vulnerability. This time the purpose of the exploit was not to disable “SafeMode”, but rather\nto write a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) shellcode in memory, and to execute it. To do so,\nthe exploit developers implemented numerous helper functions in VBScript, resulting in over 400 lines\nof code. For example, the beautified code in charge of building the ROP shellcode is shown below:\n```\n   function createROP()\n\n```\nOn Error Resume Next\n\nshell_string = Unescape(\"%u8b64%u002d...[REDACTED]\")\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nie_11_case(ole32_base)\naddToROP(ie_11_case_addr)\naddToROP(rop_case_addr)\naddToROP(&h04040404)\naddToROP(vp_address)\naddToROP(&h04040404)\naddToROP(shell_addr)\naddToROP(shell_addr)\naddToROP(&h1000)\naddToROP(&h40)\naddToROP(shell_addr+1000)\n\nab(3) = rop_string\nend function\n\nWe did not find any re-use of this code by other groups of attackers, leading us to believe\nit was specifically developed by, or for, the Sednit group.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nParts of this code seem to have been inspired by a presentation at BlackHat USA 2014, where\na security researcher named Yang Yu published some JavaScript code related to Internet Explorer\nexploitation [53]. As an example of that, Figure 12 shows one particular JavaScript function published\non one of his slides.\n\nFigure 12. Slide extracted from a BlackHat USA 2014 presentation\n\nAnd a very similar VBScript function in the Sedkit exploit code is shown below:\n```\n   function GetBaseAddrByPoiAddr_ole32( PoiAddr )\n\n```\nBaseAddr = `0`\nBaseAddr = PoiAddr And &hFFFF0000\n```\n     Do While readM(BaseAddr)<>&h00905a4d\n\n```\nBaseAddr = BaseAddr - &h10000\n```\n     Loop\n\n```\nole32_base = BaseAddr\nreturn BaseAddr\n```\n   end function\n\n```\nIn other words, the exploit developers re-implemented some of the ideas of the BlackHat\npresentation in VBScript, and implemented the ROP part themselves.\n\nWe believe this is a good example of the technical abilities available to the Sednit group.\nThe developers were able to understand a complex exploit well enough to make their own version.\nWe can speculate that the purpose of that was to bypass some security products. It also shows\nthat these developers are following technical security publications.\n\n###### Conclusion and Open Questions\n\nFrom personalized phishing emails to exploit kits, the Sednit group invested a lot of effort into\nits attack methods over the last two years. In particular, the number of 0-day exploits available\nto the group is surprisingly high, showing a significant resources at their disposal.\n\nOne major open question regarding the Sednit attack methods concerns the crawling of the Sedkit\nexploit kit. Indeed, the exact logic of the operators in accepting a visitor as a target remains unknown\nto us, and probably depends on their objectives at that moment. Given the fact that the exploit kit\nhas been the home of several 0-day exploits in the past, the ability to receive an exploit from it would\nsurely be interesting from a research perspective.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n##### Seduploader: Target Confirmation\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n###### Timeline\n\nOldest known\nSeduploader\nsample\n\n\nSeduploader OS X\nversion deployed with\nSedkit using an exploit\nagainst MacKeeper _[56]_\n\n\nSeduploader deployed with targeted\nphishing emails using an exploit for\nthe Microsoft Office vulnerability\nCVE-2015-1641 _[58]_\n\n\n**2015** **2016**\n\n**MAR** **APR** **MAY** **JUN** **JUL** **MAY** **AUG**\n\nSeduploader’s dropper integrates Seduploader deployed\na 0-day exploit for local privilege with targeted phishing\nescalation (LPE) vulnerability _[55]_ emails using a 0-day\n\nexploit for the Microsoft\nOffice vulnerability\nCVE-2015-2424 _[57]_\n\n\nMost recently known\nSeduploader sample\n\n\nOne week after the Hacking\nTeam leak, Seduploader’s\ndropper integrates a Hacking\nTeam exploit for LPE vulnerability CVE-2015-2387 _[48]_\n\nFigure 13. **Seduploader major events**\n\nThe dates posited in the timeline mainly rely on the compilation timestamps of the Seduploader\n_payloads. We believe that the payloads’ timestamps were not tampered with, because they match_\nour telemetry data, as opposed to the droppers’ timestamps. The dates in the timeline may be later\nthan the actual events though, as we do not have all Seduploader samples — but enough are present\nto give a good approximation.\n\n###### Analysis\n\nWe define Seduploader as a two-binary component, comprising a dropper and the payload usually\ncontained in this dropper. While those two have sometimes been used independently of each other,\nas shown in Figure 2, they usually are deployed together and remain the most-used first-stage\nmalware of the Sednit group since the beginning of 2015.\n\nThe payload component of Seduploader has been compiled for Windows and OS X, but our analysis\nis based solely on the Windows version. Nevertheless, the OS X version is very similar, and has been\ndescribed by BAE Systems in June 2015 [56].\n\nDropper Workflow\n\nThe workflow of Seduploader’s dropper component can be summarized by the four steps presented\nin Figure 14. While pretty straightforward, it has some interesting details that we will describe\nin this section.\n\nAnti-analysis Payload Privilege Payload\ntrick dropping escalation persistence\n\nFigure 14. **Seduploader’s dropper workflow**\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n###### Anti-Analysis Trick\n\nThe dropper starts with an unusual anti-analysis technique, shown as pseudocode in Figure 15.\n\nFigure 15. Anti-analysis trick pseudocode\n\nThis code allocates a small memory buffer B and sets its tenth byte to the value 42. It then writes\nand reads one million times into a newly created temporary file[1]. After that operation, it checks\nwhether the tenth byte of B still contains the value 42. If this is not the case, Seduploader terminates\nits execution.\n\nThis code primarily serves to delay execution with I/O intensive operations, in order to exhaust\nsecurity products’ analysis limits. It may also detect security software emulators that wrongly\nimplement memory management, and hence are unable to maintain the correct state of B due\nto the number of operations performed.\n\nThis technique was present in another dropper employed by the Sednit\ngroup in 2014, which we have not seen since then. This trick disappeared\nfrom Seduploader in December 2015 — probably because it was easy to spot\nand could be used to detect the malware. It was then replaced by a more\ncommon anti-analysis technique based on time measurement.\n\nAdditionally, important strings in Seduploader’s dropper are encrypted with a simple XOR-based\nalgorithm, and the addresses of important Windows API functions are resolved dynamically.\n\n1 The temporary file can be named jhuhugit.temp, jhuhugit.tmp or jkeyskw.temp depending\non the Seduploader version\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n###### Payload Dropping\n\nThe core logic of Seduploader’s dropper is implemented in a C++ class named UpLoader\nby its developers. This class has evolved several times since Seduploader’s first appearance,\nand its last known version contains the eight methods described in Table 4.\n\n\nTable 4. Methods of the UpLoader C++ class\n\n\nMethod (ESET names) Purpose\n\n`decrypt_in_place` Decrypts the given data using a simple XOR-based algorithm and a 10-byte key\n\n```\ndecrypt_in_new_\nmemory\n\n```\n\nDecrypts the given data using the same algorithm as decrypt_in_place, except\nthat the result is written into a newly allocated memory buffer\n\n\n`get_env_var` Retrieves the value of an environment variable\n\n```\ndecrypt_embedded_\nfiles\n\n```\n\nDecrypts one or more embedded files, with some metadata (names and location\nin which to drop them)\n\n\n`decompress` Decompresses a given memory area using Windows API function\nRtlDecompressBuffer _[59]_\n\n`drop` Writes the content of a given memory area into a file on disk\n\nexecute_file Executes a given file, which can be either a Windows library, whose export named\n```\n              init will then be called, or an executable. If the current process runs at system\n\n```\nintegrity level [60], it ensures that the child process runs at the same integrity\nlevel.\n\n`delete_file` Deletes a given file from the system\n\nUsing those C++ methods, the dropper decrypts and decompresses its embedded payload,\nwhich consists of one or more files. It then drops the files on disk and executes them. Finally, before\nremoving itself from the machine, the dropper makes the payload persistent, as we will describe\nin the following sections.\n\nWe know the developers named this class UpLoader because they left\nRun-Time Type Information (RTTI) [61] in some Seduploader samples.\nAdditionally, the following program database (PDB) [62] path overlooked\nby the developers in one sample, indicates that the binary itself is named\n```\n          Uploader:\n\n```\n\nD:\\REDMINE\\JOINER\\HEADER_PAYLOAD\\header_payload\\Uploader\\\n```\nRelease\\Uploader.pdb\n\n```\n\nThe significance of other parts of this PDB path remain obscure, except\nfor the REDMINE part, which may refer to a project management web\napplication [79].\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n###### Privilege Escalation\n\nBefore making the payload persistent on the system, Seduploader may execute local privilege\nescalation exploits. Since Seduploader’s first appearance, the two vulnerabilities described\nin Table 5 have been exploited, and both were unpatched when first used by the Sednit group.\n\n\nTable 5. Local privilege escalation vulnerabilities exploited by Seduploader\n\n\nVulnerability Affected Platforms Period of Activity Notes\n\nCVE-2015-1701 [63] Microsoft Windows <= March-April 2015 _[64]_\nWindows 7\n\nCVE-2015-2387 [65] Microsoft Windows all July 2015 _[48]_\nversions\n\n###### Payload Persistence\n\nSince its inception, Seduploader’s dropper has employed a variety of persistence methods\nfor its payload, some of them only when running with SYSTEM privileges (thanks to the previously\nmentioned exploits). Here are the most common persistence methods we observed (details are given\nin the IOC section):\n\n- Register the payload under the Run registry key _[66]. While this is essentially a classic method,_\n\nSeduploader employs a uncommon trick to write into the registry by executing JavaScript\ncode within the rundll32.exe process. This technique was first seen in the Win32/Poweliks\nmalware in mid-2014 [67], and has since been documented in detail [68].\n\n- Register the payload as a Windows service that will run at startup. This method is used\nonly when running with SYSTEM privileges.\n\n- Register the payload as a scheduled task that will run each time the current user logs in.\nThis method is used only when running with SYSTEM privileges.\n\n- Replace a legitimate Windows COM object [69] with the payload, so that it will be loaded\n\nin any process using that COM object. The exact hijacked object is a class named\nMMDeviceEnumerator _[70]. This technique has also been seen in the malware Win32/_\nCOMpfun [71].\n\n- Register the payload as a Shell Icon Overlay handler COM object _[72], so that the payload will_\n\nbe loaded each time a user logs in. The chosen CLSID of this object ({3543619C-D563-43f795EA-4DA7E1CC396A}) is already legitimately used in an Internet Explorer plug-in opensource project named “BHOinCPP” [73], probably to confuse defenders.\n\n- Register a Windows shell script under the registry key HKCU\\Environment\\\nUserInitMprLogonScript, which will run the payload at startup. This is also a documented\ntechnique _[74], yet not well known. This method is usually the preferred one when_\nSeduploader does not run with SYSTEM privileges.\n\nThe diversity of these persistence methods shows the intensity of the development effort behind\nSeduploader, and that its developers have a good grasp of the current literature, as several\nof these techniques seem to have been inspired by other malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nPayload Workflow\n\nThe workflow of the Seduploader payload is presented in Figure 16. This binary can be roughly\ndescribed as a first-stage reconnaissance tool, probably used to distinguish security researchers\nperforming analysis from real targets. In this section we describe the workflow of this payload\nas found in the most recent version.\n\nConfiguration file\ndownload\n\nNetwork link Reconnaissance Network link\nestablishment report establishment\n\nInitialization **Main loop**\n\nLogs Payload\nreporting download\n\nPayload\nexecution\n\nFigure 16. **Seduploader’s payload workflow**\n\n###### Initialization\n\nNetwork Link Establishment\nThe first operation of the Seduploader payload is to find a reliable way to reach its C&C server\non the Internet, which may be difficult depending on the network setup of the compromised\norganization. To test whether the compromised machine is connected to the Internet without\nattracting attention, Seduploader tries to reach Google servers over HTTP, usually google.com\nor google.ru.\n\nThis part of the Seduploader code changed several times over the last year and currently contains\nthree possible means of communication, pictured in Figure 17 and described below.\n\nDirect Inject into\n\nVia proxy\n\nconnection running browser\n\nGoogle\nsuccessfully\ncontacted\n\nFigure 17. Workflow of the network link establishment\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n1. Direct Connection\nFirst, Seduploader simply sends an HTTP POST request to Google with a pseudo-randomly-generated\nURI path. If the HTTP status code in the answer is either 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found) — the most\nlikely answer because there is little chance the pseudo-random URI path exists on Google\nwebsites — the network connection is assumed to be working. In this event, Seduploader\ninitialization continues to the next step.\n\nOn the other hand, if Seduploader receives a different HTTP status code, it means the connection\nhas been blocked (and hence any later attempt to reach the C&C server will also likely be blocked).\nIn this case, Seduploader tries an alternative method to establish the network link, as described\nin the next two sections.\n\nBefore testing the connection, Seduploader checks if the computer has\na working network interface. To do so, it searches for an interface with\nan IP address different from 127.0.0.1 and 169.254.155.178. This second\nIP address belongs to IPv4 Link-Local network 169.254.0.0/16, from which\nan address is randomly chosen by a computer failing to receive an IP address\nvia DHCP protocol _[75]. Therefore, it makes very little sense to check_\nfor a particular IP address in this network, as all addresses have the same\nprobability of being chosen.\n\n2. Via Proxy\nSome organizations force their computers to pass through an HTTP proxy to access the Internet,\nwhich may explain why the previous direct connection did not work. To use the proxy, Seduploader\nneeds to retrieve its IP address and TCP port number, plus some credentials, if needed.\n\nTo retrieve this information, Seduploader searches for proxy configuration settings in the Firefox\nbrowser, via the two following steps:\n\n- It parses the Firefox preference file (pref.js) to find the network.proxy.http\nand network.proxy.http_port fields, respectively, containing the proxy address and port\nnumber.\n\n- It retrieves the proxy credentials from the custom Windows registry key HKCU\\Control\nPanel\\Desktop\\WeelScrInit. Interestingly, this registry key was created during\nthe exploitation of the target by Sedkit.\n\nFor example, the following code snippet comes from a Sedkit exploit against Firefox\n(CVE-2014-1510 [37]), and sets the registry key WeelScrInit to the value of the HTTP field Proxy```\nAuthorization, after a request has been made to download the payload. This HTTP field contains\n\n```\nthe credentials for proxy basic authentication, and can be reused for multiple requests _[76]._\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nOnce the proxy information has been retrieved, Seduploader sends an HTTP POST request\nto Google via the proxy and checks the answer status code, in the same way as previously described.\n\nWe speculate that only Firefox is currently implemented because Sednit\noperators have had trouble establishing an Internet connection on specific\ntargets using this browser, while the code injection technique described below\nwas good enough for other browsers. The proxy information retrieval code\nhas been built so that it could possibly be extended to other browsers than\nFirefox, with the use of an abstract C++ class.\n\n3. Inject Into a Running Browser\nIf the proxy method also fails, Seduploader injects some code into a running browser, which may\nallow it to bypass network security products. To do so, Seduploader waits for the user to launch a\nbrowser, by regularly enumerating the running processes and comparing the hash of their names\nwith some hardcoded values. The hash function is a simple series of ROL 7 operations, and Table 6\nshows the list of targeted browsers.\n\n\nTable 6. Targeted browsers\n\n\nHash Process Name Browser Name\n\n0x250DFA8F iexplore.exe Internet Explorer\n\n0x7712FEAE firefox.exe Firefox\n\n0xBD3CC33A chrome.exe Google Chrome\n\n0x7A38EBF3 opera.exe Opera\n\n0x4A36ABF3 browser.exe Yandex Browser\n\nIf a browser is found running, Seduploader injects a shellcode into its memory, and creates\na thread in it with the CreateRemoteThread Windows API. This shellcode tries to contact Google in\na way similar to that described above, and communicates the result back to the Seduploader process\nthrough shared memory. This shared memory is created with the Windows API OpenFileMapping\nand bears a hardcoded, random-looking name.\n\nIf all the tested methods fail, Seduploader will try all the methods again, until there is a working\nInternet connection.\n\nReconnaissance Report\nOnce the network link has been established, Seduploader builds a report on the compromised\nmachine in the form of id=XXXXXX&w=…​. The id parameter contains the serial number of the hard\ndrive and serves to identify the machine, while the w parameter contains the actual report with\nthe following information:\n\n- List of running processes\n\n- Hard drive information extracted from Windows registry key HKLM\\SYSTEM\\\nCurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum (preceded by disk=)\n\n- Build identifier, which is a hardcoded 4-byte value (preceded by build=)\n\n- Optional field named inject indicating whether the network link was established through\n\nbrowser injection\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nAn example of such a report is shown below:\n\n\nid=rA;ù&w=@[System Process]\n```\nSystem\n\n```\nsmss.exe\ncsrss.exe\n\n[REDACTED]\ndisk=SCSI\\Disk&Ven_VMware_&Prod_VMware_Virtual_S\\[REDACTED]\nbuild=0xb58f978f\n\n\nThe report is then encrypted with a simple algorithm: a pseudo-randomly-generated 4-byte value\nis XORed with a hardcoded 4-byte value (different in each sample), and serves as a key to XOR the data.\nThe encrypted data are then appended to the key.\n\nFinally, the resulting encrypted data are sent as the body of an HTTP POST request.\nAll communications with the C&C server are sent in the same manner.\n\nThe build identifier was introduced in May 2015. Between then and writing\nthis report we have seen 10 different values.\n\n###### Main Loop\n\nAfter the initialization step, the code enters its main loop, as described in Figure 15. This loop\ncomprises the following steps:\n\n1. Establish the network link, with the same tests as executed during initialization\n\n2. Download a configuration file from the C&C server, by sending an HTTP POST request with\n```\n  id=XXXXXX&c=1 in the body (before encryption). This configuration file provides information\n\n```\non how to retrieve and execute an additional payload, and its structure is the following\n(most fields are optional, and self-explanatory):\n\n\n\n[file]\nExecute\nDelete\n\n[settings]\nRundll=<export name>\nPathToSave=<path>\nFileName=<file name>\nIP=<IP address>\n\n[/settings]\n\n[/file]\n\n\n3. Download a payload executable from the C&C server, according to the configuration file,\n\nby sending an HTTP POST request with id=XXXXXX&f=<file name> in the body (before\nencryption)\n\n4. Run the payload executable, according to the configuration file\n\n5. Report to the C&C server the return code of the execution (retrieved with the GetLastError\nAPI), by sending an HTTP POST request with id=XXXXXX&l=<error code>\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\nDownloading a configuration file first, so as then to fetch a payload binary:\nthis is also the workflow of Downdelph, described in the third part of this\nwhitepaper. Moreover, Seduploader and Downdelph share some wording\nin their configuration files, which may indicate that the same developers\nare behind the two components.\n\nAccording to our observations, the payload binary is usually either Sedreco or Xagent,\nthe spying backdoors of the Sednit group.\n\n###### Conclusion and Open Questions\n\nOver the last year, Seduploader became the most-used first-stage malware of the Sednit group.\nDuring this time, this component has been under intense development, for example by adding\npersistence methods to the dropper, or improving the payload’s ability to contact its C&C server.\n\nThe purpose of Seduploader is twofold. First, it serves to establish a network link between the\ncompromised machine and the C&C server, bypassing possible network security measures. Second,\nit serves to check that the infected computer belongs to an intended target (and in particular, does\nnot belong to a security researcher).\n\nWe do not know the exact logic used to select certain computers as being interest. We speculate\nthat Sednit operators know quite precisely the target’s environment in many cases, because they\nhad already infected computers belonging to the same organization in the past. Hence the simple\nSeduploader report is informative enough to select real targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n##### Closing Remarks\n\nThe attack methods and malware described in this first part of our whitepaper demonstrate\nthe technical abilities and the review of the literature of the Sednit group. For example, the group\nrevamped the 0-day exploits from the Hacking Team data leak only a few days after their release,\ncreated a brand new exploit for the CVE-2014-6332 vulnerability based on a presentation at the\nBlackHat conference, and regularly integrated novel persistence methods into Seduploader.\n\nThe attack methods of the Sednit group are not limited to those described in this whitepaper.\nIn particular, we know from several investigations that they have:\n\n- Trojanized some legitimate private applications used in some Eastern European embassies,\n\nso that the employees would be infected with spying malware when running the modified\nexecutable\n\n- Hacked into some Linux servers using a known vulnerability for WordPress\n\n- Hacked into some Zimbra webmail servers using a known vulnerability\n\nOverall, the Sednit group is always looking for new ways to approach its targets,\nboth with opportunistic strategies and by developing its own original methods.\n\n\n-----\n\n### En Route with Sednit\n\n\n##### Indicators of Compromise\n\n###### Email Attachments\n\n ESET Detection
