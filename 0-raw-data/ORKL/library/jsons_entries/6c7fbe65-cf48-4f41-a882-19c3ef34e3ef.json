Understanding the threat landscape of a country, however, requires an\nunderstanding of its geography first and foremost.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Map of Ukraine and bordering countries\nUkraine, bordered by Russia as well as Belarus has seen its share of hostile intelligence\noperations and near declarations of war. The annexation of Crimea, a peninsula that was\nofficially recognized as part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia early 2014: this was one of\nthe first and larger “turning points” in modern history.\n\nMore recently, in 2018, Russia took it one step further after several years of absorbing\n[Crimea as part of Russia, by installing a border fence to separate Crimea from Ukraine.[1]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46699807)\n\nIn 2020, during several Belarusian protests targeted at Belarus’ current president\nLukashenko, Ukraine recalled its ambassador to assess the prospects, or lack thereof,\n[regarding their bilateral relationship.[2] Tensions increased further, and in 2021, Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/article/belarus-election-ukraine-idINKCN25D1PU?edition-redirect=in)\n[joined the European Union (EU) in imposing sanctions on Belarusian officials.[3]](https://www.kyivpost.com/eastern-europe/ukraine-joins-eu-sanctions-against-belarus-as-eu-plans-more-sanctions.html)\n\nIn 2022, this tension materialized by Russia actively performing military operations on\n[Ukraine’s border, and in February, the bombardment of several strategic sites in Ukraine.[4]](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-24-22-intl/index.html)\n\n## Historical Cyber Attacks\n\nAs mentioned, to understand a country, one needs to understand its geography and\ngeopolitical strategy. A remarkable initiative from Ukraine is their intent on joining NATO as\nwell as becoming an official member of the EU. These initiatives are likely the trigger for the\nrecent turmoil in December 2021 where Russia became openly bold more aggressive and\n\n\n-----\n\nwith ultimate goal as explained by Putin: to unify or absorb Ukraine back into Russia. In that\nsame month, Putin presented to the United States and NATO a list of security demands,\n[including Ukraine not ever joining NATO.[5] The intent of Putin is, as always, likely to have](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato)\nmultiple dimensions.\n\nThis report will describe further history of cyber-attacks on Ukraine, a timeline of current\nrelevant events in the cyberspace, and finally some recommendations to ensure protection in\ncase of “cyberwar spillover” as was in the case of NotPetya in 2017.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, Ukraine has seen its fair share of targeted cyber-attacks.\nThe table below captures significant Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns / attacks\nagainst Ukraine specifically.\n\n\n**Attack Group** **Attack**\n**Purpose**\n\n**Black Energy (aka Sandworm)** Disrupt /\nDestroy\n\n**Black Energy** Disrupt /\nDestroy\n\n**Black Energy** Disrupt /\nDestroy\n\n\n**Malware / Toolset** **Date**\n\n\nKillDisk / Black\nEnergy\n\n\n2015\n\n\nIndustroyer 2016\n\nNotPetya 2017\n\n\n**Grey Energy** **(Black Energy successor)** Espionage GreyEnergy 2018\n\n**Black Energy** Espionage VPNFilter 2018\n\n\n**Unknown, likely DEV-0586 (aka**\nGhostWriter)\n\n\nDisrupt /\nDestroy\n\n\nWhisperGate 2022\n\nHermeticWiper 2022\n\nCyclops Blink 2022*\n\nIndustroyer 2 2022\n\n\n**Unknown, likely DEV-0586** Disrupt /\nDestroy\n\n**Black Energy** Disrupt /\nDestroy\n\n**Black Energy** Disrupt /\nDestroy\n\n\nTable 1 – Key historic attacks\nOther attacks have taken place, both cyber-espionage and cyber-criminal, but the threat\ngroup “Black Energy” is by far the most prolific in targeting Ukrainian businesses and\ngovernmental institutions.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlack Energy and its successors and sub-units are attributed to Russia s Intelligence\nDirectorate or GRU (now known as the “Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of\nthe Armed Forces of the Russian Federation”). The GRU is Russia’s largest foreign\nintelligence agency and has therefore access to a vast number of resources, capabilities,\nand certain freedom to execute more risky intelligence operations. Note that APT28, also\n[known as Sofacy and “Fancy Bear” is also part of the GRU but resides in a different unit.[6]](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/)\n\nSpecifically looking at the attacks targeting Ukraine in 2022, a timeline can be observed\nbelow:\n\nFigure 2 – Ukraine 2022 timeline\nHighlighted in blue on the timeline, are suspected attack campaigns by nation states, likely\neither Russia or Belarus. Highlighted in green are suspected attack campaigns by\ncybercriminal actors in favor of Russia.\n\nHighlighted in red on the timeline, is an intelligence counteraction by Ukraine’s Security\nService, known as the SSU or SBU. The SSU can be seen as Ukraine’s main government\nagency protecting national interests, but also has a focus on counterintelligence operations.\nOn February 8 2022, the SSU shut down a Russian “trolling farm” that had as sole intent toth\ndistributed “fake news” to spread panic. The bots also published false information about\n[bomb threats at various facilities.[7]](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-likviduvala-18ty-tysiachnu-botofermu-u-lvovi-pid-kuratorstvom-rf-siialy-paniku-ta-minuvaly-obiekty-video)\n\nNVISO CTI assesses with moderate confidence Russia and Belarus will continue destructive\nor espionage operations on Ukraine’s infrastructure and those who support Ukraine whether\nit be logistically, operationally, or otherwise publicly.\n\nAs of yet, spillover of these operations has not been observed in Belgium by organizations\n[such as the Centre for Cyber security Belgium (CCB).[8] The UK’s National Cyber Security](https://ccb.belgium.be/en/news/russian-regime-does-not-shy-away-waging-online-war-should-we-be-worried)\nCentre (NCSC) in turn advices “organizations to act following Russia’s attack on Ukraine”\n[and provides further guidance.[9]](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/organisations-urged-to-bolster-defences)\n\n### Key historical operations\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a quick overview of the aforementioned pre-2022 attacks, the following are some of the\nkey elements that contributed to their success, and which are important to take into account\nwhen building a detection strategy:\n\nThe attack on the Ukrainian power grid was prefaced with a phishing attack against a\nnumber of energy distribution companies. The phishing email contained a Word\ndocument that, when Macros were enabled, dropped the Black Energy malware to\ndisk. Using this malware the adversaries obtained credentials to access VPN and\nremote support systems that allowed them to open circuit breakers remotely. In order to\nprevent the operators from closing the circuit breakers remotely again, a wiper was\ndeployed on the operator machines.\n**NotPetya was initially deployed via a supply chain attack on Linkos Group. The**\nNotPetya ransomware caused worldwide damages due to its highly effective spreading\nmechanism combining the EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerability, credential dumping\nfrom infected systems and PsExec for lateral movement.\n**GreyEnergy and its accompanying toolset was typically prefaced with a phishing**\nattack, containing malicious documents that would deploy “GreyEnergy mini”, a firststage backdoor. A second point of entry was via vulnerable public-facing web services\nthat are connected to the organization’s internal network. The attacker’s toolset also\ncontained Nmap and Mimikatz for discovery and lateral movement.\n**VPNFilter is a multi-stage, modular platform with versatile capabilities to perform a**\nwide range of operations, primarily espionage but also destructive attacks. The\nmalware installs itself on network devices such as routers and NAS, and can only be\ncompletely removed with a full reinstallation. Its current preface or infection vector is\nunknown, but it is assumed they target vulnerabilities in these network devices as an\ninitial entrypoint. VPNFilter was a broad-targeting malware and campaign, but was\nresponsible for multiple large-scale attacks that targeted devices in Ukraine.\n**Cyclops Blink is the “replacement framework” of VPNFilter and has been active since**\nat least June 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. Just like VPNFilter,\nCyclops Blink is broad-targeting, but might be targeting devices in Ukraine specifically.\nAs opposed to VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink is only known to target WatchGuard network\ndevices at this point in time. Its preface is WatchGuard devices that expose the remote\nmanagement interface to the internet / external access.\n\n## Current Cyber Attacks (2022)\n\n### WhisperGate\n\nStarting on January 13, 2022, several Ukrainian organizations were hit with a destructiveth\nmalware now known as WhisperGate. The malware was designed to wipe the Master Boot\nRecord, MBR, and proceed to corrupt the files on disk, destroying all traces of the data.\n\n\n-----\n\nInitial execution of the first stage was completed using the Python tool Impacket, this being\nwidely used for lateral movement and execution. Initial access to run Impacket is believed to\nhave occurred via insecure remote access channels and using stolen/harvested credentials.\n\nOnce the MBR is wiped, a fake ransom screen is displayed. This is just to distract while the\nthird stage is downloaded from a Discord link. Then all data is overwritten on disk.\n\n### Massive web defacements\n\nBetween the 13 and 14 of January, a coordinated web defacement on severalth th\ngovernmental institutions of Ukraine took place – all websites and their content were wiped\n[and replaced with a statement[10]:](https://therecord.media/hackers-deface-ukrainian-government-websites/)\n\n_Ukrainian! All your personal data has been sent to a public network. All data on your_\n_computer is destroyed and cannot be recovered. All information about you stab (public, fairy_\n_tale and wait for the worst. It is for you for your past, the future and the future. For Volhynia,_\n_[OUN UPA, Galicia, Poland and historical areas.[10]](https://therecord.media/hackers-deface-ukrainian-government-websites/)_\nThe SSU assesses the attack happened via a vulnerable Content Management System\n(CMS), and that “in total more than 70 state websites were attacked, 10 of which were\n[subjected to unauthorized interference”.[11]](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-rozsliduie-prychetnist-rosiiskykh-spetssluzhb-do-sohodnishnoi-kiberataky-na-orhany-derzhavnoi-vlady-ukrainy)\n\n### DDOS attacks on organizations\n\n\n[On February 15, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) tweeted[11] that “th](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1493628291844083723) _The MOU website_\n_probably suffered a DDoS attack: an excessive number of requests per second was_\n_recorded._\n\n_Technical works on restoration of regular functioning are carried out.”_\n\nThe attack was carried out on the MoD itself and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but also on\ntwo national banks, which had as result that internet banking was not available for several\nhours.\n\n### DDoS attacks & the “HermeticBunch”\n\nOn February 23, there were two newly reported cyber events: DDoS attacks and an attackrd\ncampaign we could name “HermeticBunch”.\n\n\nNetBlock, an internet observatory, noted the DDoS attacks on February 23 around 4pmrd\nCET. The attacks were impacting the websites of Ukraine’s MoD, Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n[(MoFA) and other governmental institutions.[12]](https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1496498930925940738)\n\n[ESET initially reported[13] detecting a new wiper malware used in Ukraine. Their telemetry](https://mobile.twitter.com/esetresearch/status/1496581903205511181)\nindicated the malware was installed on several hundreds of machines with first instances\n[discovered around 4pm CET. Symantec posted an analysis[14] the next day corroborating](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ukraine-wiper-malware-russia)\n\n\n-----\n\nESET s findings, and providing more insight into the attack: ransomware was initially\ndeployed, as a smokescreen, to hide the data-wiping malware that was effectively used to\nlaunch attacks against Ukrainian organizations.\n\n[ESET reported on March 1st [15] that multiple Ukrainian organizations were targeted by an](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\nattack campaign comprising:\n\n**HermeticWiper, a data-wiping malware;**\n**HermeticWizard, spreads HermeticWiper over the network (using WMI & SMB);**\n**HermeticRansom: likely a ransomware smokescreen for HermeticWiper.**\n\nThese components indicate an organized attack campaign with as main purpose destruction\nof data. While the spreader malware, HermeticWizard, is worrisome, it can be blocked by\nimplementing the advice from the Recommendations section below.\n\nNote that AVAST Threat Labs has created a decrypter for files encrypted with\n[HermeticRansom. [17]](https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/help-for-ukraine-free-decryptor-for-hermeticransom-ransomware/#howto)\n\n### IsaacWiper\n\n[IsaacWiper was first detected by ESET on February 24th [18], and was leveraged again for](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/)\ndestructive attacks against the Ukrainian government. The wiper is less sophisticated than\nHermeticWiper, but not less effective.\n\n### DanaBot\n\nDanaBot is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform where threat actors (“affiliates”) can\n[purchase access to the underlying DanaBot platform. Zscaler reported on March 2nd [19] to](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/danabot-launches-ddos-attack-against-ukrainian-ministry-defense)\nhave identified a threat actor targeting Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) using DanaBot’s\ndownload and execute module.\n\n### Fake AV Update leading to Cobalt Strike\n\nPhishing emails impersonating the Ukrainian government were seen during a campaign to\ndeliver Cobalt Strike beacons and Go backdoors on the 12th of March. Reported by the\n[Ukraine CERT (CERT-UA) [20], the emails were themed as “critical security updates” and](https://cert.gov.ua/article/37704)\ncontained links to download a fake AV update package. The 60 MB file was actually a\ndownloader which then connected to a Discord CDN to download a file called one.exe. This\nbeing a Cobalt Strike beacon. It also downloads a Go dropper that executes and pulls down\ntwo more Go payloads, GraphSteel and GrimPlant. Both of these being backdoors.\n\n### CaddyWiper\n\n\n-----\n\n[CaddyWiper was discovered by ESET on March 14th [21] and it is the 4th data wiping](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1503436423818534915)\nmalware to be used against Ukraine. It was deployed in the attacks via GPO, this showing\nthat the threat actor already had a major foothold in the environment. It also has functions to\ncause it to not wipe Domain Controllers, this being the foothold the attackers would lose if\ndestroyed.\n\n### Deepfake video\n\nOn 16 Mar 2022, Facebook removed a deepfake video of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy\nasking Ukrainian troops to surrender. The video initially appeared on the compromised\nwebsite of news channel, Ukraine 24, before it was spread to other compromised websites,\nsuch as Segodnya. In response, Zelenskyy published a video of his own, asking Russian\n[troops to surrender instead. [22]](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/facebook-removes-deepfake-of-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy/)\n\n### Industroyer2\n\nOn 12 Apr 2022, Eset reported on Industroyer2. ESET researchers collaborated with CERTUA to analyze the attack against an Ukrainian energy company. The destructive actions were\nscheduled for 2022-04-08 but artifacts suggest that the attack had been planned for at least\ntwo weeks\n\nThe attack used ICS-capable malware and regular disk wipers for Windows, Linux and\nSolaris operating systems. In addition to Industroyer2, Sandworm used several destructive\nmalware families including CaddyWiper, ORCSHRED, SOLOSHRED and AWFULSHRED.\nEset had first discovered CaddyWiper on 2022-03-14 when it was used against a Ukrainian\n[bank (see also above).[23]](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/04/12/industroyer2-industroyer-reloaded/)\n\n### Note on scammers\n\nNow that a lot of organizations are offering aid to Ukraine, it’s more than ever important to\nvalidate the source of the aid offering. This can translate into either:\n\nScammers pretending to be humanitarian or aid organizations;\nScammers pretending to be law enforcement or others offering direct help to Ukrainian\ncitizens.\n\nIt’s highly recommended to always perform proper vetting of those offering aid, asking for aid\nor otherwise request for compensation. Unfortunately, even in these times, scammers will try\nto take advantage to fill their pockets. As a side note, CERT-UA had also reported on\n[scammers impersonating the CIA.[24]](https://cert.gov.ua/article/39727)\n\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on the collective knowledge on adversary groups acting in the interests of the Russian\nstate and the current ongoing events, it is important for organizations to use this momentum\nto implement a number of critical defenses and harden their overall environment\n\n\n-----\n\nEach organization should review their own threat model with regards to the potential threats\nfacing them, however, the below is a good overview to improve your security posture against\na variety of (destructive) attacks.\n\n### Your external exposure\n\nIt is advised to perform a periodic assessment on your external perimeter to identify what\nsystems and services are exposed to the internet. Given the cloud first approach many\norganizations are taking, it has become less straight forward of identifying what services your\norganization is exposing to the internet, however, attack surface monitoring solutions can\nprovide an answer to that by looking beyond the scope of your organization IP range.\n\nFor all identified services exposed to the internet, ensure:\n\nValidate these are actually required to be exposed to the internet;\nThey are up to date with the latest security patches.\n\nFor all services for which authentication is required (e.g. VPN solutions, access to your client\nportal, etc.) it is strongly advised to enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA).\n\n### Abuse of (privileged) accounts\n\nOnce inside your network, threat actors are very frequently seen going after privileged\naccounts (can be local admin accounts or privileged domain accounts).\n\nIn terms of local admin accounts, it is important to ensure these accounts have strong\npasswords assigned to them, and that no password re-use is performed across different\nhosts. Each local administrator account as such should have a unique strong password\nassigned to it. Various tools exist that can support in the automated configuration of these\nunique passwords for each of these accounts. A good example that can be used is\nMicrosoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS).\n\nFor privileged domain accounts (e.g. a specific server administrator, the domain\nadministrator or the accounts that have access to your security tooling such as EDR’s), it is\nstrongly advised to implement MFA.\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\nOnce the adversary has obtained access into the environment, they’ll move laterally to\neventually gain access to the critical assets of the organization. The following are a number\nof key recommendations to help in the prevention of successful lateral movement:\n\nImplement network segmentation and restrict the communication flows between\nsegments only to the ones required for business reasons;\n\n\n-----\n\nConfigure host-based firewalls to restrict inbound connections (depending on your\nbusiness, a few questions to ask could be: should I allow inbound SMB on my\nworkstations, should an inbound RDP connection be possible from another\nworkstation, etc.)\nHarden RDP configuration by:\n\nDenying server or Domain Administrator accounts from authenticating to\nworkstations;\nEnforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA);\nWhere possible, use Remote Credential Guard or Restricted Admin.\n\nIn addition to the implementation of key hardening principles, the lateral movement phase of\nan attack is also an opportunity in which adversaries can be detected. Monitoring should be\nperformed on workstation-to-workstation traffic and authentications, usage of RDP and WMI,\nas well as commonly used lateral movement tools such as PsExec, WinRM and PS\nRemoting.\n\n[Mandiant has additionally provided guidance on protecting against destructive attacks [20]](https://www.mandiant.com/media/14506/download)\n(PDF).\n\n### Critical Assets\n\nIn several cases, the adversaries have been observed conducting destructive attacks. As a\nproactive measure, ensure offline backups of your critical assets (such as your Domain\nControllers) are created regularly. A frequent overlooked aspect of a backup strategy is the\nrestore tests. On a frequent basis, it should be verified that the backup can effectively be\nrestored to a known good state.\n\nOn a final note, given that the majority of systems are virtualized these days, it’s important to\nensure the access to your back-end virtualization environment is properly segmented and\nsecured.\n\n### Phishing Prevention\n\nA number of the observed attacks that Russia linked threat actors have executed were\ninitiated via a phishing campaign with the goal of stealing user credentials or executing\nmalware on the systems. As such, it is important to verify the hardening settings of your mail\ninfrastructure. Some key elements to take into account are:\n\nEnable MFA on all mailboxes;\nDisable legacy protocols that do not understand MFA and as such would allow an\nadversary to bypass this security control;\nPerform sandbox execution of all attachments received via mail;\nEnable safe links (various mail security provides provide this option) to have the URL\nchecked for phishing markers once the user clicks.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, it is frequently observed that the adversaries are attempting to have a user\nenable Macros in the malicious office documents they send. It is advised to review if all users\nwithin your environment use Office Macros and whether or not these can be disabled. If\nMacros are used for business reasons, consider only allowing signed Macros.\n\n### DDOS Mitigations\n\nDepending on your organization’s risk profile, there is the potential threat of a DDoS attack,\nespecially following sanctions imposed on Russia in specific sectors. It is advised to\ninvestigate and implement DDoS mitigations on critical public-facing assets. Noteworthy is\n[Google’s Project Shield [19], which is “a free service that defends news, human rights and](https://projectshield.withgoogle.com/landing)\nelection monitoring sites from DDoS attacks”. Google has recently expanded protection for\nUkraine, and is already protecting more than 150 websites hosted in Ukraine.\n\n### Crisis & Incident Management\n\nTabletop exercises are a great way of measuring the crisis & incident management\nprocesses & procedures you currently have, and to identify any potential gaps that may be\nuncovered during a tabletop. Moreover, tabletops are cross-functional and can be used for\nboth leadership, as well as anyone working with incidents on a day to day basis. The results\nof a tabletop exercise can ultimately be used as a platform to improve the current way of\nworking, or to invest in new resources should there be a need.\n\n### About the authors\n\n\nBart\nParys\n\nRobert\nNixon\n\nMichel\nCoene\n\n\nBart is a manager at NVISO where he mainly focuses on Threat Intelligence and\nMalware Analysis.
