Something like this\nhas happened before.\n\n[In December 2016, the source code of the BankBot Android banking trojan leaked online,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-banking-trojan-source-code-leaked-online-leads-to-new-variation-right-away/)\nand it led to a massive outburst of malware campaigns pushing the trojan in 2017.\n\nThe BankBot code's availability lowered the entry barrier and financial costs for wannabe\nmalware authors to enter the Android malware scene. Now, with Exobot being shared in the\nsame way, security researchers are bracing for a similar surge of campaigns.\n\n## Exobot is very powerful\n\n[Cengiz Han Sahin, security researcher and spokesperson with ThreatFabric, says that](https://www.threatfabric.com/)\nExobot is a pretty potent banking trojan, capable of infecting even smartphones running the\nlatest Android versions, something that very few trojans can do.\n\n\"All threat actors have been working on timing injects (overlay attacks) to work on Android 7,\n8, and even 9,\" Sahin says. \"However Exobot really is something new.\n\n\"The trojan gets the package name of the foreground app without requiring any additional\npermissions,\" he says, \"This is a bit buggy, still, but works in most cases.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe interesting part here is that no Android permissions are required, Sahin adds. All other\nAndroid banking trojans families are using the Accessibility ore Use Stats permissions to\nachieve the same goal and therefore require user interaction with the victim.\"\n\nSo not only is Exobot's source code freely accessible, but its also of pretty effective, just like\nthe BankBot code was top-of-the-line when it was leaked in 2016. In the coming months, we\nmay see Android malware devs slowly migrating their campaigns from BankBot to Exobot, as\nfew will decline a \"free upgrade\" to a better code.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Top 10 Android banking trojans target apps with 1 billion downloads](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/top-10-android-banking-trojans-target-apps-with-1-billion-downloads/)\n\n[Mobile trojan detections rise as malware distribution level declines](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mobile-trojan-detections-rise-as-malware-distribution-level-declines/)\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[SMSFactory Android malware sneakily subscribes to premium services](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/smsfactory-android-malware-sneakily-subscribes-to-premium-services/)\n\n[FluBot Android malware operation shutdown by law enforcement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flubot-android-malware-operation-shutdown-by-law-enforcement/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a few\nmore.
