Blog](https://securityscorecard.com/blog)\n\nRyan Sherstobitoff\n\nPosted on June 18th, 2021\n\n[SecurityScorecard’s Investigations & Analysis team conducted an investigation into the details surrounding the USAID.gov attack. As has been](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium)\npreviously reported, the attack has been potentially attributed to the organization commonly known as Cozy Bear, but our investigation found\nthat the campaign is likely much larger, and began much earlier than has been reported.\n\n## Key findings\n\nSome of the attack components were created as early as February 2021, potentially suggesting this campaign had multiple waves dating\nback to the beginning of this year.\nSecurityScorecard’s analysis suggests that there are multiple campaigns connected to the USAID.gov attack that focus on European\ngovernments.\nWe suspect that the attackers are located in the Central Europe and Pacific time zones based on the time zones of the timestamps from\nthe ISO files containing malicious implants.\n\n_Timeline of APT29 Activity against US AID_\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nO ay, 0, [c oso t e eased a b og post stat g t at](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/05/27/nobelium-cyberattack-nativezone-solarwinds/) obe u /Co y ea, t e sa e uss a ac e s o ca ed out t e So a ds\nattack, was attacking government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organizations. The company said the breach\nbegan with a takeover of an email marketing account utilized by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe SecurityScorecard Investigations & Analysis team conducted an investigation to understand the extent of the campaign and its association\nwith APT29, also known as CozyBear. In an effort to understand actor(s) capabilities and intent, the team analyzed a number of different\nsamples and artifacts which were part of this campaign. We uncovered a longer-running espionage campaign focused on European\nGovernments dating back to earlier this year. The USAID-themed campaign was just the latest in a series of operations involving very similar\ntechniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs).\n\nSecurityScorecard’s Investigations & Analysis team analyzed the reported implant and associated artifacts with the US AID campaign. Our\ngoal was to find any linkage to previous operations conducted by the same adversary.\n\nThe primary implant is a file known as a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) which contains an encrypted Cobalt Strike beacon. Cobalt Strike is a\npenetration testing product that is favored among threat actors because it’s well-written, stable, and customizable for ransomware, keylogging,\nand other payloads. Its use in criminal activities has increased significantly since March 2020 when the product source code was cracked and\n[distributed on the dark web. Cobalt Strike is an implant used commonly by Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, and other](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/what-is-an-advanced-persistent-threat)\ncybercrime groups. The DLL file operates as a loader for the beacon and has a number of interesting functionalities.\n\nFrom SecurityScorecard’s analysis of some of the delivery malware (ISO and MacOS DMG files), the attack occurred on May 25, 2021.\nHowever, according to file metadata and other information, the attackers began preparing for the attack on April 22, 2021. We collected a total\nof 6 disk image files with the volume_id of ICA_DECLASS dating back to April 22, 2021.\n\n_File Metadata from Disk Image file (ICA-declass.iso)_\n\nInvestigating further, we found three DMG (Disk iMaGe) files created on April 22, 2021, and one created on April 25, 2021, which were likely\nused to create the two ICA-declass.iso files found in the wild. This data indicates that the attack preparation stages began in late April with\nseveral targeted image files containing the same implant, LNK, and decoy document. Malware delivered by threat actors often utilizes what is\ncalled a decoy document, which is presented to the user as a benign document while the execution of the malicious code occurs in the\nbackground.\n\n\n-----\n\n_File Metadata from Disk Image file found earlier in April (ICA-declass.iso)_\n\nThe decoy document is based on a report written by the U.S Intelligence community in March 2021.\n\n### Primary delivery\n\nFrom our analysis, the .ISO files containing the implant, LNK, and PDF files were delivered from the following URL.\n\nhxxps://usaid.theyardservice.com/d/[victim email address]\n\nWe found evidence of appended victim email addresses, which indicates possible victims (i.e. victimology) and better information on\nspecifically who the threat actor was interested in.\n\n### Possible false flags\n\nIn many APT attacks, threat actors will implement false flags (a method used in intelligence trade-craft to misdirect and confuse the true origin\nof the threat actors) that will lead investigators to then misattribute the attack. In this case, we observed Korean language characters within the\nPDB value for the primary implant. The PDB path indicates the folder path on the disk where the code was compiled. However, we did not find\nany evidence that would indicate the origin of this attack had any association with Korean-speaking threat actors.\n\nC:\\Users\\dev\\Desktop\\나타나게 하다\\Dll6\\x64\\Release\\Dll6.pdb\n\n### ISO time zones\n\nUsing the ExifTool, we extracted the following timestamps from the ISO and DMG files:\n\nRootDirectoryCreateDate - the timestamp when the root directory was created\nVolumeCreateDate - the timestamp when the volume was created\nVolumeModifyDate - the timestamp when the volume was modified\n\nSince these timestamps contain the time zone, they can give us indicators about the attacker’s location.\n\nWe suspect these timestamps are accurate because they match the timeframe of the campaigns as reported by Microsoft. Additionally, it\nseems unlikely the attackers would have changed only the time zone values in the ISO files, especially given the locations indicated by the\ntime zones.\n\nIf the attackers were to make changes to these timestamps, they would have:\n\nremoved the timestamps entirely,\nchanged the timestamps to completely different values, as they did with the implant DLL files contained in the ISOs, which were changed\nto April 27, 2019, for both April and May waves, or\nchanged only the time zones to match the Korean one, given that they tried to place a false flag leading investigators to think it might be\na North Korean APT using the program debug path (PDB) string.\n\n\n-----\n\nindex hash name timestamp timezone\n\n\n1 2523f94bd4fba4af76f4411fe61084a7e7d80dec163c9ccba9226c80b8b31252 ICA-declass.iso 2021:05:25\n14:39:25+01:00\n\n2 94786066a64c0eb260a28a2959fcd31d63d175ade8b05ae682d3f6f9b2a5a916 ICA-declass.iso 2021:04:22\n12:17:12+01:00\n\n3 324c9201b71c9e62dc7120a0e010617039ea6a25df0d1fee9eaa1fbd3e87bff1 ICA-declass 2021:04:22\n12:17:12+01:00\n\n4 54923793beb5d51261effaf636e3b95c64f38daeca8594fb72ad278844ce2eac ICA-declass 2021:04:22\n12:17:12+01:00\n\n5 b36823cea4ef39b9a30efb57d6db1c1dc15f2e65d16af217b554506cb7ee7bbe ICA-declass 2021:04:22\n12:17:12+01:00\n\n6 d035d394a82ae1e44b25e273f99eae8e2369da828d6b6fdb95076fd3eb5de142 ICA-declass 2021:05:25\n14:39:25+01:00\n\n7 6e2069758228e8d69f8c0a82a88ca7433a0a71076c9b1cb0d4646ba8236edf23 invitation.iso 2021:02:17\n06:10:38-08:00\n\n8 f006af714379fdd63923536d908f916f4c55480f3d07adadd53d5807e0c285ee Reply slip.iso 2021:03:15\n11:33:55-07:00\n\n9 749bf48a22ca161d86b6e36e71a6817b478a99d935cd721e8bf3dba716224c84 NV.img 2021:05:12\n17:01:30-07:00\n\n10 89016b87e97a07b4e0263a18827defdeaa3e150b1523534bbdebe7305beabb64 AktualizC!ciu.img 2021:03:22\n10:06:58-07:00\n\n_Table 1: Time zones for the image files containing the DLL implant_\n\n\nCentral\nEuropean\nTime\n\nCentral\nEuropean\nTime\n\nCentral\nEuropean\nTime\n\nCentral\nEuropean\nTime\n\nCentral\nEuropean\nTime\n\nCentral\nEuropean\nTime\n\nPacific\nStandard\nTime\n\nPacific\nDaylight\nTime\n\nPacific\nDaylight\nTime\n\nPacific\nDaylight\nTime\n\n\nThis means that the location of the systems on which the ISO files were created is somewhere in the Central European time zone\n(UTC+01:00) for the ICA_DECLASS campaign (samples 1-6) and somewhere in the Pacific time zone (UTC-08:00 during Standard Time and\nUTC-07:00 during Daylight time) for the non-ICA_DECLASS campaigns (samples 7-10).\n\nThis might suggest:\n\na group split in two different locations,\nchanging the clock settings to reflect the target’s local\ntwo different groups\n\nThe hypothesis for this being two different groups is supported by the fact that both campaigns coexisted during a period of time in which the\nICA_DECLASS campaign didn’t change much between its April and May waves (the decoy document and the shortcut are identical, the DLL\nfile is identical except some anti-analysis techniques added to the packer), while the non-ICA_DECLASS campaigns varied significantly the\nmalware delivery mechanism for the February, March and May waves using various components such as the NV HTML dropper, the BoomBox\nmalware, and the NativeCacheSvc loader.\n\n### Anti-analysis\n\nIn the US AID attack, the implant from April makes use of techniques to complicate analysis. The implant from May is identical but without the\nanti-analysis techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\ne a t a a ys s co po ates et ods to e su e t does ot e ecute a tua o sa dbo ed e o e t s s o as e as e\nmalware” because it attempts to avoid detection by being aware of the environment in which it has landed. Modern anti-virus solutions and\nplatforms create so-called “detonation environments” for email attachments and file downloads in a virtual or sandboxed workstation instance\nin order to observe any malicious behavior by the malware in order to keep it from infecting or compromising actual company assets and\nenvironments.\n\n**Processor make**\n\nOne specific evasive malware technique is obtaining information about the CPU processor make and model through querying the cpuid. If the\ncpuid matches any of those in the list shown in the screenshot, the implant will exit without exhibiting its next attack phase behaviors. The\nimplant incorporates a predefined list of cpuid values that are associated with popular virtualized and sandboxed environments.\n\n**Virtualbox guest addition utilities**\n\nThe implant will also exit if any of the following files exist on the target machine as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n**Adapter organizational unique identifier (OUI)**\n\nThe implant will check the adapter OUI for a set of specific values and will exit if the OUI matches.\n\n\n-----\n\na ys s o t e a a e e ea s t e o o g p ede ed st o OU a ues, a y o c cause t e p a t to e t e ecut o\n\n08:00:27 PCS Systemtechnik GmbH\n08:00:20 Oracle Corporation\n00:1c:42 Parallels, Inc.\n00:05:69 VMware, Inc.\n00:00:29 IMC NETWORKS CORP.\n00:01:14 KANDA TSUSHIN KOGYO CO., LTD.\n00:50:56 VMware, Inc.\n\n**Checking registry keys**\n\nFurthermore, the implant will exit if the following registry keys exist on the target system as they are associated with virtual server\nenvironments and sandboxed environments.\n\nThe implant will try to open each registry key using the API RegOpenKeyExA to determine if a registry key exists in the system. If the registry\nkey exists the malware decides to discontinue further execution of the payload until such time as it has reached a “real” laptop or workstation.\n\n### Second-stage payload\n\nIf all the checks mentioned in the section above pass, the implant is ready to deploy second-stage payloads and will de-obfuscate the next\nstage malware payload in a newly allocated memory address on the laptop or workstation and jump to it.\n\n**Memory allocation**\n\nThe memory will be created with the protection flag “PAGE_READWRITE”\n\nTherefore the 261,670 bytes allocated only allows read and write access. After the code was written to an active memory location, the implant\nwill change the flag to “PAGE_EXECUTE_READ”, which changes the memory address to be executable.\n\n**De-obfuscation**\n\nThe implant de-obfuscates data stored in the “.data” section and stores it in the newly allocated memory for execution. The de-obfuscation is\nsimply swapping two consecutive bytes’ order\n\nAfter this change, the code calls the start of the allocated address:\n\nSince the allocated address contains the packed DLL prepended by a few NOP instructions, it interprets the first few bytes of the DLL MS-DOS\nheader as code instructions and executes them. These few code instructions compute an address located somewhere in the middle of the\nallocated memory, which contains the only un-encrypted part of the code. It starts executing from there in order to decrypt the rest of the DLL\nby XOR-ing each byte with a single byte key and execute it.\n\n**Cobalt Strike beacon**\n\nThe de-obfuscated code is a customized Cobalt Strike beacon with the following configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\npayload type windows-beacon_https-reverse_https\n\nport 443\n\nsleeptime 45000\n\nmaxgetsize 1403644\n\njitter 37\n\npublickey 30819f300d06092a864886f70d010101050003818d003081890281810086bae1427b24ba6af5627f9fcc0266babc4ecc\n\nserver, get-uri 'dataplane.theyardservice.com,/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2,cdn.theyardservice.com,/jquery-3.3.1.min.woff2,static.theyard\n\nspawnTo (NULL ...)\n\nspawnto_x86 '%windir%\\\\syswow64\\\\dllhost.exe'\n\nspawnto_x64 '%windir%\\\\sysnative\\\\dllhost.exe'\n\ncryptoScheme 0\n\nget-verb 'GET'\n\npost-verb 'POST'\n\nHttpPostChunk 0\n\nlicense-id 1359593325\n\nbStageCleanup 1\n\nbCFGCaution 0\n\nuseragent 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko'\n\npost-uri '/jquery-3.3.2.min.woff2'\n\nMalleable_C2_Instructions '\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x05ò\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x00T\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x0f[\\x00\\x\n\nhttp_get_header b'_cfuid=', b'Cookie'\n\nhttp_post_header b'_cfuid'\n\nHostHeader (NULL ...)\n\nUsesCookies 1\n\nproxy_type 2 IE settings\n\nkilldate 0\n\ntextSectionEnd 177872\n\n\n-----\n\nObfuscateSectionsInfo '\\x00À\\x02\\x00r¸\\x03\\x00\\x00À\\x03\\x00\\x88\\x85\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x90\\x04\\x004°\\x04\\x00\\x00À\\x04\\x00^Ï\\x04'\n\nprocess-inject-start-rwx PAGE_READWRITE\n\nprocess-inject-use-rwx PAGE_EXECUTE_READ\n\nprocess-inject-min_alloc 0\n\n\nprocess-inject-transformx86\n\nprocess-inject-transformx64\n\n\n'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x1e\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\\n\n'\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\n\n\nprocess-inject-stub '\\x0câõTDäy5\\x16µ¯ég¾\\x92U'\n\nprocess-inject-execute '\\x06\\x00B\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x06ntdll\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x13RtlUserThreadStart\\x00\\x01\\x08\\x03\\x04'\n\n\nprocess-inject-allocationmethod\n\n\n1\n\n\n## Cobalt Strike watermark\n\nThe U.S. Government and open source reporting potentially attributed the attack to APT 29 (aka Cozy Bear). The SecurityScorecard\nInvestigations & Analysis team has observed multiple artifacts indicating multiple possible sources, including false flags and intentional\noverlaps with other cybercrime groups.\n\nThrough our analysis of this attack, we observed in the Cobalt Strike beacon configuration file found within Document.DLL a value associated\nwith license-id. This value is 1359593325; this particular value has been identified as a digital watermark in open source reporting as\n[associated with actors involved with Trickbot and ransomware as well as Nim. It is possible that this is another potential false flag intended to](https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/trickbot-crews-new-cobaltstrike-loader-32c72b78e81c)\nmisattribute, or the usage of the same leaked or pirated kit of Cobalt Strike used by multiple attackers.\n\n## Attacker infrastructure\n\nIn our analysis using NetFlow data we were able to obtain visibility into how the attacker utilized various infrastructures. The adversary\naccessed infrastructure via proxies/VPNs from the United States, Brazil, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Bangladesh, Netherlands, and Mozambique.\n\n\n-----\n\n_SSH connections to 83.171.237[.]173_\n\n## Victimology\n\nThrough the analysis of the implant some possible clues exist about the victimology of this campaign. The analysis of the implant indicates that\na connection is made from the malware-infected device to usaid.gov on TCP port 443 as part of the execution process.\n\n_TCP Connection made to USAID.gov_\n\nUsing insights with NetFlow data we were able to determine that connections were made from numerous countries from May 25 to May 28.\nThis has revealed the extent of this campaign, in relation to the usaid.gov intrusion and the targeted countries that we were able to observe.\nSome of the connections made to usaid.gov are legitimate connections while others are from infected systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Connections made to USAID.gov during the campaign_\n\nVictims in click-through campaigns from targeted spear phishing emails are directed to download the ISO or DMG file.\n\nhttps://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001R6x5duwxLa513iT3wolVtyZj3Ojypr9nwPwZKB3X68SGRFzUVNUR4MdENUXj_c4poo1hx_rFF79P1NsazEFONIrA9G0ypkCwKTRfL95fp3xUyuceYYrPAtcDp20R1wmwXZ197ks1FH22V3BIcZYlAfIHdUZQ3M&c=6nYGyV77i2Z48gKmOkG81MeQ_ZZV6tFO7EIWrx0Ptyld2S0ieISXPQ==&ch=thDJXBA5D5ATg95nuLlO\n\n[[email protected]](https://securityscorecard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n_Link tied to downloading MacOS DMG image with implant_\n\nhttps://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001R6x5duwxLa513iT3wolVtyZj3Ojypr9nwPwZKB3X68SGRFzUVNUR4MdENUXj_c4poo1hx_rFF79P1NsazEFONIrA9G0ypkCwKTRfL95fp3xUyuceYYrPAtcDp20R1wmw-XZ197ks1FH22V3BIcZYlAfIHdUZQ3M&c=3kzVSpJEUGcXfsBoW4ytkDpjQ5l[BL4puvzumdVoEf0b3lDcRJGgvA==&ch=FGxQis-Nw2yGirWi8qjdrsv_upu7Nv9idIt4bOJx8RKMhJ6tZx8d7w==&[email protected]](https://securityscorecard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n_Link tied to downloading ISO image with implant_\n\nhttps://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001R6x5duwxLa513iT3wolVtyZj3Ojypr9nwPwZKB3X68SGRFzUVNUR4MdENUXj_c4poo1hx_rFF79P1NsazEFONIrA9G0ypkCwKTRfL95fp3xUyuceYYrPAtcDp20R1wmw-XZ197ks1FH22V3BIcZYlAfIHdUZQ3M&c=3kzVSpJEUGcXfsBoW4ytkDpjQ5l[BL4puvzumdVoEf0b3lDcRJGgvA==&ch=FGxQis-Nw2yGirWi8qjdrsv_upu7Nv9idIt4bOJx8RKMhJ6tZx8d7w==&[email protected]](https://securityscorecard.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n_Link tied to downloading ISO image with implant_\n\n## Campaign analysis\n\nWhile this report focuses primarily on the USAID breach and the campaign surrounding that, additional IOCs have surfaced in the public,\nindicating that the campaign is much larger than originally thought. Based on the indicators of compromise available, our analysis indicates\nthat there are multiple campaigns that focus on European governments. Many of the methods are similar to that of the USAID attack (using\nISO files with malicious content).\n\nThe data that we have collected indicates multiple campaigns by the same adversary dating back to early 2021.\n\n### Invitation campaign - February to March 2021\n\nSome of the components were created as early as February 2021, potentially suggesting this campaign had multiple waves dating back to the\nbeginning of this year. While the method of utilizing a malicious ISO file has remained unchanged, additional information has provided valuable\nnew insights.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Invitation Document.iso_\n\n**139.99.167.177 (Cobalt Strike)**\n\nThe following IP address is a Cobalt Strike command and control endpoint discovered to be associated with Invitation Document.iso. The URL\nfor this command and control server is hxxps://139.99.167.177/jquery-3.3.1.min.js. We observed connections being made to the Cobalt Strike\nserver during the period of the campaign from the United States, Brazil, India, France, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, and many other countries.\n\n_Victimology Map_\n\n**Invitation.html**\n\nThe following file was sent as a malicious attachment in a spear phishing email. Just as we observed with the USAID attack, the victim is being\nredirected to a site to download the invitation.iso file.\n\n[https://humanitarian-forum.web... email belonging to the Auswärtiges Amt, the German Federal Foreign Affairs Office](https://humanitarian-forum.web.app/mail)\n\nIn this campaign the attackers were found to be using FireBase in order to track who clicked on the links in the spear phishing emails.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Embassy of Hellenic Republic Campaign - March 2021\n\nAnother campaign that we observed occurred in March 2021, using the Embassy of Hellenic Republic (i.e. Greece) as a lure. This campaign\nalso utilizes an ISO file with a decoy document and a malicious .DLL file.\n\n_Reply_Slip.ISO_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decoy document used in campaign, with multiple typos and misspellings_\n\n_Malicious HTML to load ISO file_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Malicious HTML_\n\n### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Italy Campaign - May 2021\n\nAnother campaign that was observed was using the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Italy as a lure. This campaign also utilizes the BOOM loader\nas described below in the Belgium campaign analysis.\n\n_Attachment.img_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decoy Document_\n\n### Belgium Government Campaign - May 2021\n\nAnother campaign that was discovered to be operating using decoy documents used content from the Government of Belgium. The following\ndecoy document was contained within a file named NV.img.\n\n\n-----\n\n_NV.PDF decoy document_\n\n\n-----\n\n_NV.img metadata_\n\n_NV.img contents_\n\nA basic data gathering implant known as BOOM was involved in this campaign, compiled May 12, 2021. This file is also designed to load a\nDLL file into Explorer.exe, a native Windows executable. The BOOM.exe contained the following PDB path contained within the metadata.\n\nC:\\Users\\dev10vs\\Desktop\\Prog\\Obj\\BOOM\\BOOM\\BOOM\\obj\\Release\\BOOM.pdb\n\nBased on the .NET GUID value there are four variants of the BOOM malware.\n\nThe BOOM executable is a .NET executable.\n\n_.NET properties for BOOM.exe_\n\nThe implant has the capability of capturing host information such as IP address, domain name, operating system, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Get host information_\n\nBased on code analysis of the BOOM.exe there is a function to also get Active Directory information from a target system.\n\n_Get ADINFO function_\n\nThe implant had the capability of uploading and downloading files on Dropbox.\n\n\n-----\n\n_URL Definitions_\n\n_Download Function_\n\n_Upload File function_\n\nBesides the data gathering functionality, this implant will also load a DLL file (NativeCacheSvc.dll) into Explorer.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The associated spear phishing email accompanying the malicious files was sent on May 12, 2021.](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/cybersecurity-threats-to-protect-against-in-2021)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following is an analysis associated with the URL contained within the attachment NV.html. We observed a number of connections being\nmade to the IP address hosting a malicious file img_lk.png during the month of May. The domain enpport.com, used to deliver the malicious\nHTML, resolved to the IP address 54.38.137.218. This URL is contained within an attachment for an email sent to victims in a targeted spear\nphishing campaign.\n\nAttachment in spear phishing email\n\n_Connections made to hxxp://54.38.137.218/img_lk.png_\n\n### What can organizations do to detect the activity?\n\nAll organizations are susceptible to cyber attacks. For any that suspect they have been affected (and even those who don't) continuous\nmonitoring is critical to have in place to alert on suspicious IPs.\n\nWe also cannot overstate the importance of human error and not falling prey to phishing emails. No firewall product will stop an organization\nfrom getting breached if employees click on compromised links. Cybersecurity training and basic literacy are essential to an organization’s\nsafety.\n\nAdditionally, not having exposed services is the top barrier to most adversaries. Keep in mind that ransomware groups scan the internet for\nvulnerable services and run automated code to hack the boxes. APTs however are dedicating teams to researching and understanding very\nspecific targets and exploiting an organization’s weaknesses -- be they social or digital. Constant vigilance is key to understanding if your\norganization has been compromised and how to prevent it in the future.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nat bega as a a a ys s o a attac o US as e pa ded ou u de sta d g o t e scope o ta gets to c ude se e a u opea\ngovernment offices as well as non-government organizations. The piece that links all of these entities is their role in shaping international\npolicy. A combination of evasive malware, spear phishing, and vulnerability exploits in the targets of the attack provides ample evidence that\nthis is the work of an APT and not the usual organized crime behavior looking to make money through ransomware and malware. If this pattern\nof attack were to be extrapolated beyond the current TTPs, one can presume that data exfiltration, extortion, disinformation, and disruption of\nthe targeted organizations is to be expected in the near future.\n\nIn order to mitigate and lessen the impact of these attacks, SecurityScorecard has dedicated the attention of its Investigations & Analysis team\nto researching and understanding the mechanics of the attacks in order to share that information with the larger community of threat\nintelligence researchers, government agencies, information security professionals and associated media organizations. It is through the\nsharing of information that our collective awareness and ability to defend against these and other attacks is fortified. In the delivery of our\nsecurity ratings platform and threat intelligence research, we have built a powerful engine of analysis and insights into the daily changes to the\nsecurity posture of over 5 million companies and organizations.\n\n[Return to Blog](https://securityscorecard.com/blog)\n\n\n-----",
