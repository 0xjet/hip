    "plain_text": "# Baltimore ransomware attack was early attempt at data extortion, new report shows\n\n**[statescoop.com/baltimore-ransomware-crowdstrike-extortion/](https://statescoop.com/baltimore-ransomware-crowdstrike-extortion/)**\n\nSeptember 25, 2020\n\n[City](https://statescoop.com/news/city)\n\nBaltimore's Inner Harbor (Getty Images)\n\nWritten by [Benjamin Freed](https://statescoop.com/author/benjamin-freed/)\n\nSep 25, 2020 | STATESCOOP\nThe May 2019 ransomware attack against Baltimore that debilitated municipal services for\nweeks, cost the city government as much as to $18 million and led to the ouster of the city’s\nchief information officer also included an early attempt by hackers pressuring a victim into\npaying up by threatening to publish stolen data, according to research published this week\nby the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.\n\nIn a [blog post Thursday, the company said that two days after the Baltimore hack was](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/double-trouble-ransomware-data-leak-extortion-part-1/)\nreported, the actor behind it posted a message on the dark web threatening to expose or\ndestroy the city’s compromised data, in an attempt to extort then-Mayor Bernard C. “Jack”\nYoung into paying a ransom of about $76,000.\n\n\n-----\n\nHey, Jack Young and other Baltimore leaders. In 7 June 2019 thats your dead line, well\nremove all of things weve had about your city and you can tell other [redacted] to help you\nfor getting back [redacted]. This final dead line and never ever gonna back,” read the\nmessage from the actor behind the RobbinHood ransomware, which CrowdStrike calls\nOutlaw Spider.\n\nYoung refused to pay, but the message now sticks out as an early example of a step that’s\nsince become typical of ransomware incidents.\n\n“Although ineffective, the incident with the [City of Baltimore] and Outlaw Spider was the first\ninstance observed by CrowdStrike Intelligence of data extortion to incentivize ransom\npayment,” the CrowdStrike blog reads.\n\nAttempting to extort ransomware victims into paying by threatening to publish stolen files was\n[popularized last November with the rise of Maze malware. The actors behind that](https://statescoop.com/tag/maze/)\nransomware pioneered the tactic of creating a publicly accessible website where victims are\nlisted, along with samples of stolen files and threats to publish or sell full volumes of\nexfiltrated data unless the hackers are paid off. Other well-known ransomware actors,\nincluding those behind the REvil and DoppelPaymer malwares, have since adopted the\npractice. The change in tactics is natural for an enterprise that’s motivated by making as\nmuch money as possible.\n\n“It’s continuing to evolve,” Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s vice president of intelligence, told\nStateScoop in a phone interview.\n\nMeyers said the extortion sites are an outgrowth of the trend lines seen in ransomware over\nthe past five or six years. As cryptocurrency ransoms became more valuable, he said,\nhackers changed their targets from individual victims to enterprises like corporations and\ngovernment organizations — what CrowdStrike and other cybersecurity firms call “big game\nhunting.”\n\nIn attempting to goad victims into paying ransoms by threatening to expose potentially\nsensitive information, Meyers said, negotiations between hacker and victim “are\ncommoditized.”\n\n“These guys are financially motivated, they’re in it for the money,” he said.\n\nMeyers said IT organizations need to continue taking many of the oft-recommended cyber\nhygiene steps, including regular security patching and implementing endpoint-detection\ntools. But he also said organizations need to invest in newer tools like “next-generation”\nantivirus platforms that use machine learning to detect malicious activity.\n\nAnd he also said 2020 has been a good year for ransomware actors and other\ncybercriminals, which he credited in part to the fact that the explosion of remote-work\nenvironments brought on by the COVID-19 crisis has created many more entry points for\n\n\n-----\n\nattackers.\n\n“We’ve seen as many attacks in the first half of 2020 as we did in all of 2019,” he said. “It’s\nrecession proof, it’s pandemic proof.”\n\nMeyers echoed previous findings that cybercriminals are tailoring their phishing messages to\nplay off public health and economic crises.\n\n“Covid’s been a boon for the threat actors because it gave them so many things to capitalize\non,” he said. “Threat actors capitalize on fear or greed. Greed is powerful, but when people\nthink they’re going to die or be out of business, now you’ve got a much more powerful tool in\nyour quiver.”\n\n\n-----",
