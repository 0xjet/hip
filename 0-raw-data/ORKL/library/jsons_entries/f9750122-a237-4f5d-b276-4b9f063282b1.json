It does not run on the\nnew Mountain Lion 10.8.\n_______\n\nIntego has discovered a new Trojan called OSX/Crisis. This threat is a dropper which creates\na backdoor when it’s run. It installs silently, without requiring a password, and works only in\nOSX versions 10.6 and 10.7 – Snow Leopard and Lion.\n\nThe Trojan preserves itself against reboots, so it will continue to run until it’s removed.\nDepending on whether or not the dropper runs on a user account with Admin permissions, it\nwill install different components. We have not yet seen if or how this threat is installed on a\nuser’s system; it may be that an installer component will try to establish Admin permissions.\n\nIf the dropper runs on a system with Admin permissions, it will drop a rootkit to hide itself. In\neither case, it creates a number of files and folders to complete its tasks. It creates 17 files\nwhen it’s run with Admin permissions, 14 files when it’s run without. Many of these are\nrandomly named, but there are some that are consistent.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith or without Admin permissions, this folder is created in the infected user s home\ndirectory:\n\n~/Library/ScriptingAdditions/appleHID/\n\nOnly with Admin permissions, this folder is created:\n\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/XPCServices/\n\nThe backdoor component calls home to the IP address 176.58.100.37 every 5 minutes,\nawaiting instructions. The file is created in a way that is intended to make reverse\nengineering tools more difficult to use when analyzing the file. This sort of anti-analysis\ntechnique is common in Windows malware, but is relatively uncommon for OS X malware.\n\nIt uses low-level system calls to hide its activities, as shown in the following images:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n[Intego found samples of this malware on the VirusTotal website, a site used by security](https://www.virustotal.com/)\ncompanies to share malware samples. This threat has not yet been found in the wild, and so\nfar there is no indication that this Trojan has infected users so right now the threat is\nconsidered to be a low risk. Nonetheless, Intego VirusBarrier X6 detects and removes this\nmalware using today’s definitions. It detects the dropper component as OSX/Crisis, and the\nbackdoor component as Backdoor:OSX/Crisis. It will also block connections with the IP\naddress the backdoor component seeks to connect with.\n\n[Intego VirusBarrier X6 users need to update as soon as possible to get protection from this](https://www.intego.com/virusbarrier)\nthreat.\n\nWe are still analyzing the threat at this time. We will post a more in-depth analysis as we\nhave more details.\n\n\n-----",
