Blog](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs)\n\nApril 15, 2021 | [Dax Morrow](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/author/dax-morrow)\n_This blog was jointly written with Ofer Caspi. Some of the links in this blog require an OTX account, and the_\n_QakBot infrastructure tracker will require readers to be customers with access to the Threat Intel subscription.._\n_Thanks to the following researchers and the MalwareBazaar Project:_\n\n## Executive summary\n\n[AT&T Alien Labs closely monitors the evolution of crimeware such as the QakBot (also known as Qbot)](https://otx.alienvault.com/malware/Trojan:Win32%2FQakbot/)\nmalware family and campaigns in connection with QakBot. The jointly coordinated takedown of the actors\n[behind Emotet in late January has left a gap in the cybercrime landscape, which QakBot seems poised to fill.](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\n\nKey Points:\n\n[TA551 has added QakBot to its arsenal, which also includes IcedID.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.qakbot)\n\nQakBot employs anti-virus evasion, anti-detection, and anti-sandbox tactics across the entire spectrum of\nthe attack.\n\nThe actor(s) behind QakBot possess a modular framework consisting of maldoc builders, signed loaders,\nand DLLs that produce initially low detection rates at the beginning of the attack, which creates\nopportunities to deliver additional malware such as Egregor and Cobalt Strike.\nThe actor(s) responsible for QakBot have an active affiliate program.\nTA551, Cobalt Strike, and QakBot have all been observed jointly within the context of individual\ncampaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Analysis\n\nQakbot, also known as QBot or Pinkslipbot, is a modular information stealer. It has been active since 2007 and\nprimarily used by financially motivated actors. It was initially known as a banking Trojan and a loader using C2\n[servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. The hallmarks of](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.qakbot)\na QakBot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (T1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails\nthat contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc.\nThe phishing emails alternate between file attachments (T1566.001) and links (T1566.002). QakBot is often\nused as a gateway entry, similar to TrickBot or Emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging\n[frameworks such as Cobalt Strike as well as delivering Ransomware.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Recent+Qakbot+Qbot+activity/26862/)\n\nQakBot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate\nfrom hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective.\nFigure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent QakBot lure with the subject “Re: SIGNED QUOTE” and a ZIP\nfile attachment labeled “Cancellation_Letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.\n\nFigure 1. QakBot \"Signed Quote\" Email Lure\n\nThe actors further establish the trust and confidence of the targeted user by presenting a semi-official looking\nDocuSign graphic that guides the user through the process of enabling the Excel 4 Macros. A representative\n[sample, 78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a, seen in a recent QakBot](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a)\ncampaign is shown in Figure 2 below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. QakBot DocuSign Lure\n\nQakBot Excel spreadsheets often contain hidden spreadsheets, Excel 4.0 macros, spreadsheet formulas, and\nBIFF records all designed to pass a visual inspection from the user with the added benefit of bypassing\ndetection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. Figure 3 below\n[shows a screenshot of output from the open-source XLMMacroDeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated](https://github.com/DissectMalware/XLMMacroDeobfuscator)\nExcel 4.0 macros.\n\nFigure 3. XLMMacroDeobfuscator Output for a QakBot Excel 4.0 Macro Spreadsheet\n\nOnce the Excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the CALL to URLDownloadToFileA, which downloads\nthe QakBot DLL in this campaign from http[:]//rlyrt26rnxw02vqijgs[.]com/fera/frid[.]gif. Next, the EXEC function is\nevaluated which executes “rundll32.exe nxckew.wle, DllRegisterServer”. It is also a common tactic for QakBot to\nexecute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,DllRegisterServer”. Both instances are designed to evade sandbox\n[environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. A representative QakBot DLL analyzed](https://www.binarydefense.com/qakbot-upgrades-to-stealthier-persistence-method/)\n[by Alien Labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports:](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28)\nthe entry point (0x10005a5d) and DllRegisterServer (0x10029c88)and if DllRegisterServer is not called via\nregsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious\ncode in DllRegisterServer is not called. Figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the\nmacro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheet\n\nThe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the QakBot Excel spreadsheet is run\ninside a sandbox in Figure 4 below.\n\n[Figure 4. OTX screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\nxckew.wle, DllRegisterServer'' execution](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a)\n\nBefore executing the main payload, the QakBot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good\ncandidate for infection. The QakBot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is\nrunning on a Virtual Machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as\nAntiVirus products or common security researcher tools. Figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of\nthe QakBot loader.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. QakBot Execution Flow\n\nTo make detection and analysis harder, QakBot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use.\nOnce the QakBot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. An\nexample of this can be seen in Figure 6 below, which shows QakBot decrypting a string containing the value for\nlpProcName passed as a parameter to the GetProcAddress API call. The selected function, which has been\nlabeled in IDA Pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.\n\nFigure 6. QakBot GetProcAddress and clear_mem routines\n\nWhen executed, QakBot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the\nspecified malware folder. If QakBot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /C\nparameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its Anti-VM checks on the machine and return the\nresults to the parent process. If QakBot detects it is running in a VM environment, then the final payload will not\nbe decrypted since QakBot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. Figure 7\nbelow shows the QakBot environment check logic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. QakBot Environment Check Logic\n\nSpecifically, QakBot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in Table\n1 below.\n\nPROCESS NAMES\n\n```\nAutoruns.exe bds-vision-agent              app.exe\n\n```\n```\nbds-vision-agentnai.exe\n\n```\n```\nbds-vision-apis.exe CFF Explorer.exe dsniff.exe\ndumpcap.exe Fiddler.exe HashMyFiles.exe\nidaq.exe idaq64.exe lordpe.exe\n\n```\n```\nMultiAnalysis_v1.0.29\n4.exe\n\n```\n```\nnetmon.exe OLLYDBG.EXE\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n pr0c3xp.exe ProcessHacker.exe Procmon.exe\n Procmon64.exe regshot.exe ResourceHacker.exe\n runsample.exe samp1e.exe sample.exe\n Tcpview.exe TPAutoConnect.exe VBoxService.exe\n VBoxTray.exe VGAuthService.exe vm3dservice.exe\n vmacthlp.exe vmtoolsd.exe windbg.exe\n Wireshark.exe x32dbg.exe x64dbg.exe\n\n### Table 1. AntiVM process name checks for security, monitoring, and analysis tools\n\n```\nFigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (T1140).\n\nFigure 8. QakBot decrypting tool check strings\n\n\n-----\n\nQakBot will also add its folder to the Windows Defender exclusions setting located in the Registry (T1112),\nwhich prevents Defender from scanning QakBot artifacts. The Registry location can be seen in Figure 9 below.\n\nFigure 9. QakBot adding exclusion paths to Windows Defender settings\n\nIn addition to the previously mentioned environment check, QakBot collects system information (T1082) such as\ncomputer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in Figure 10 below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. QakBot system information collection\n\nQakBot will use process hollowing (T1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. If it is unsuccessful then\nQakBot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. The screen shot in Figure 11 illustrates the\nQakBot process name decryption routine.\n\nFigure 11. QakBot routine to decrypt process names for injection\n\nFigure 12 below shows the QakBot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its\nexecution.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. QakBot process hollowing routine\n\nAdditionally, QakBot abuses the Service Control Manager (SCM) to create a child process, which is then\n[detached from the parent when the SCM terminates the parent process. QakBot C2 communications begin in](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-abusing-service-control-manager-establish-persistence-non-service-applications/)\nthis stage to make it more difficult to monitor. Figure 13 below shows the SCM spawned process abuse\ntechnique.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. QakBot abusing SCM to spawn a detached process\n\nFigure 14 below shows the QakBot C2 ping during the SCM interaction.\n\nFigure 14. QakBot sending C2 ping\n\nFinally, if the QakBot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then QakBot will\nproceed to decrypt and execute the main QakBot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. The decryption\nand import table resolution of its main payload is shown in Figure 15 below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. QakBot decryption and import table resolution of main payload\n\nThe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus,\nEDR, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. Despite the limitations and\nchallenges presented by QakBot DLLs there is ample opportunity to detect QakBot loaders signed by revoked\n[and blacklisted malicious certificates. Alien Labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers,](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/faq/#cscb)\nwhich are included in Detection Methods section to aid in detection and hunting with **[YARA and Osquery.](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/yara/1454e3d91e3fd7f17f945f4ad826ffe01ed27693)**\nAdditionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, Indicators of Behavior (IOB), which provide\nopportunities for detection.\n\n## Recommended actions\n\n1. Search for a renamed version of “wmic.exe” such as “xml.com”, which spawns “regsvr32.exe” and\n\nexecutes files with JPG or GIF [file extensions.](https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1365367464427716613)\n2. Regularly perform process auditing and accounting looking for process oddities such as\n\n1. parent to child relationships “excel.exe” spawning “rundll32.exe”.\n[2. Instances of “WerFault.exe” executing without a command line.](https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1334224870536712192)\n[3. “esentutl.exe” executing with a command line containing the term “WebCache”.](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/qbot/)\n3. Check for unrecognized exclusions, files or folders, in Windows Defender settings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlien Labs has observed QakBot over the past three months being used in a role similar to TrickBot, which\nincludes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post\nexploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery.
