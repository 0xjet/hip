According to the](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/artikel/5348201/hackers-rusland-lng-gasterminal-nederland-europese-unie-cyberoorlog)\nFBI and other investigators, the hacker groups are affiliated with Russia.\n\n“We know that LNG terminals are a target. It’s just a question of when and how,” Casey\nBrooks of the American cyber security company Dragos told the broadcaster. Hacker groups\nXenotime and Kamacite are poking at the digital systems of Gasunie’s LNG terminal in\nEemshaven in Rotterdam, Brooks said. “These are tests to see where they could potentially\nhave an impact with a digital attack.”\n\nAccording to the FBI, Xenotime and Kamacite have ties to the Russian secret service.\n\nDutch company EclecticIQ also noticed more activity around vital infrastructure in Europe\nand the Netherlands. It makes sense that Russian hackers are now targeting Dutch LNG\nterminals, Joep Gommers of EclecticIQ said to RTL. “It is certainly within Russia’s modus\noperandi and focus at this time.”\n\nCybersecurity expert Fox-IT thinks there is a concrete threat of malicious parties targeting\ncompanies in the energy sector due to the energy crisis. “Particularly in the supply chain for\nthe supply and distribution of LNG,’ a spokesperson said. “The parties interested in this\nsector are probably state-sponsored malicious groups, for example, the groups led by the\nRussian FSB and GRU.”\n\nBart Groothuis, a VVD Member of the European Parliament, is aware of signals that Russia’s\ntargeting gas supplies. “It is gradually time that we act on this before things go wrong. Gas is\nRussia’s favorite weapon against the EU. Causing chaos on the energy market and\nmanipulating that market is a cereal geopolitical objective ” he said to the broadcaster\n\n\n-----",
