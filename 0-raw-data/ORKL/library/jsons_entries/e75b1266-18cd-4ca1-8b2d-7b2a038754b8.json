We found that\nthis campaign has been active at least since February 2021 and some C&C servers were\nstill active in June 2021. Threat actor used mostly Cobalt Strike and phishing emails and\ndocuments on behalf of Slovak National Security Authority. Our threat intelligence and\nmalware research revealed several command and controls servers around the globe. Some\nof them had direct relations to targets in Slovak republic.\n\n## Cobalt Strike\n\n\n-----\n\n[As described on the Cobalt Strike s website, Cobalt Strike is software for Adversary](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\nSimulations and Red Team Operations”. It is a commercial tool with price $3,500 per user\nfor one year and it is used by many pentesters and red teamers as well as by some of the\nadvanced threat actors such as APT19, APT29, APT32, Leviathan, Cobalt Group and FIN6.\nAgain, official website says:\n\n“Cobalt Strike gives you a post-exploitation agent and covert channels to emulate a\nquiet long-term embedded actor in your customer’s network”.\n\nTherefore it is kind of more interesting malware than relatively common backdoors, rats and\nMetasploit and other publicly accessible free samples.\n\n## “NSA” ISO Sample\n\n[Somebody submitted the sample called AktualizC!ciu.img to the sandbox Any.Run on 23rd](https://app.any.run/tasks/2c77358b-a7bc-4ebc-b034-362a1ddd0cd3/)\nMarch 2021. This sample was been submitted for analysis from Slovakia. And then, it has\nbeen submitted again on 9th April. Probabably someone was already/again investigating\nthe attack. The original ISO filesystem contains timestamps with information about the\ntimezone: UTC-07:00 (Pacific Daylight Time). Also, this sample has been submitted to\n[VirusTotal shortly after the reported timestamps of creation the ISO filesystems. This](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/89016b87e97a07b4e0263a18827defdeaa3e150b1523534bbdebe7305beabb64/details)\nindicates that no tampering of creation timestamps of ISO filesystem has been applied.\n\nThe Volume name of the ISO filesystem is interesting - it contains “NBU”, which is\nabbreviation of the National Security Authority in Slovakia.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 1: NSA ISO Sample\n\nFig. 2: Content of NSA ISO Sample\n\nThe “NSA” ISO Sample contains two files: one LNK file and one DLL file. The LNK file\nactually executes the following command: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe`\n```\ndiassvcs.dll InitializeComponent\n\n```\nRefering the access time of LNK file, this file has been accessed 13 minutes before the ISO\nfilesystem has been created. Thus there is probably no automation in the packaging\nprocess of the malware sample and the payload for delivery (see below) has been created\nmanually by human.\n\nFig. 3: Details of LNK file from NSA ISO Sample\n\n## Cobalt Strike Beacon\n\nDLL file `diassvcs.dll is a loader/packer with some anti-analysis protections enabled. In`\nthe picture below there is the unpacking routine consisting of decryption loops followed by\nthe calls to `VirtualProtect Windows API and to the unpacked payload itself.`\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 4: Unpacking routine of DLL Loader from NSA ISO Sample\n\nThe unpacked payload is DLL file, but without standard MS-DOS header. This malformed\nheader can be often seen for example in Metasploit’s Meterpreter payloads and it is used\nas a part of shellcode.\n\nFig. 5: Malformed MZ header of unpacked Cobalt Strike Beacon\n\nThis DLL file is actually a Cobalt Strike Beacon. The extracted configuration is attached\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nBeaconType            HTTPS\nPort               - 443\nSleepTime            - 45000\nMaxGetSize            - 1403644\nJitter              - 37\nMaxDNS              - Not Found\nPublicKey            b'0\\x81\\x9f0\\r\\x06\\t*\\x86H\\x86\\xf7\\r\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x05\\x00\\x03\\x81\\x8d\\x000\\x81\\x89\\x02\n\\xa0\\x13/.@\\xda\\xf4\\xf7q\\xf3y\\x84\\xf3b!\\x9fw\\xf4\\xf6D\\xb5\\xe7w\\x19\\x17\\xe60&\\x10\\xb4]\nC2Server             - content.pcmsar.net,/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\nUserAgent            - Not Found\nHttpPostUri           - /jquery-3.3.2.min.js\nHttpGet_Metadata         - Not Found\nHttpPost_Metadata        - Not Found\nSpawnTo             b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'\nPipeName             - Not Found\nDNS_Idle             - Not Found\nDNS_Sleep            - Not Found\nSSH_Host             - Not Found\nSSH_Port             - Not Found\nSSH_Username           - Not Found\nSSH_Password_Plaintext      - Not Found\nSSH_Password_Pubkey       - Not Found\nHttpGet_Verb           - GET\nHttpPost_Verb          - POST\nHttpPostChunk          - 0\nSpawnto_x86           - %windir%\\syswow64\\dllhost.exe\nSpawnto_x64           - %windir%\\sysnative\\dllhost.exe\nCryptoScheme           - 0\nProxy_Config           - Not Found\nProxy_User            - Not Found\nProxy_Password          - Not Found\nProxy_Behavior          - Use IE settings\nWatermark            - 1359593325\nbStageCleanup          - True\nbCFGCaution           - False\nKillDate             - 0\nbProcInject_StartRWX       - False\nbProcInject_UseRWX        - False\nbProcInject_MinAllocSize     - 17500\nProcInject_PrependAppend_x86   - b'\\x90\\x90'\n                  Empty\nProcInject_PrependAppend_x64   - b'\\x90\\x90'\n                  Empty\nProcInject_Execute        - ntdll:RtlUserThreadStart\n                  CreateThread\n                  NtQueueApcThread-s\n                  CreateRemoteThread\n                  RtlCreateUserThread\nProcInject_AllocationMethod   - NtMapViewOfSection\nbUsesCookies           - True\nHostHeader            - \n\n```\n\n-----\n\n[From this config we can see that this is a HTTP Beacon based on jQuery](https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2) Malleable-C2\nprofile\n\n## Cobalt Strike C2 Server\n\nAnalysis of Cobalt Strike C2 Server at content.pcmsar[.]net revealed couple of interesting\nthings. The server is hosted at Canadian OVH SAS hosting. It is powered by nginx\nwebserver, with Let’s Encrypt certificate issued on Mar 15 08:27:41 2021 GMT\n(approximately one week before the Cobalt Strike Payload packed into ISO). Without any\n[parameters, the HTTP requests are redirected to https://spectator.sme.sk/, a popular](https://spectator.sme.sk/)\nSlovakia’s English-language online newspaper.\n\nFig. 6: HTTPS details of Cobalt Strike C&C server\n\n## Threat Actor C2 Infrastructure\n\nBased on observations above (and couple of others) there is possible to discover more C2\nservers. Some of them are hosted in OVH, and many of them have SSL/TLS certificates\nissued by Sectigo instead of Let’s Encrypt. They are active since February 2021\n(confirmed), but probably some of them was used also back in 2020. These C2 servers also\n\n\n-----\n\nincorporated the redirection to innocent websites and they uses similar domains by\nthemselves. For example, C2 server hosted at cbdnewsandreviews[.]net redirects visitors to\n[https://www.newsreview.com//.](https://www.newsreview.com//)\n\nThe discovered C2 servers are located around the globe, for example, in Canada, France\nand Australia.\n\nFig. 7: HTTPS details of another Cobalt Strike C&C server\n\n## More Malware Samples\n\nWith information about C2 infrastructure, our researchers have found another malware\n[samples linked to the same threat actor. For example, another ISO called evil.iso. This file](https://app.any.run/tasks/ba7a2275-e53a-4870-a0f6-6201d128d758/)\nis very similar to the analyzed “NSA” ISO, it contains LNK and DLL file with Cobalt Strike\nBeacon payload. It was submitted to Any.Run on 26th February 2021 from Netherlands\n(hypothesis is that the malware analyst used the ProtonVPN which is often used by them\nfor protecting their privacy). First submittion on VirusTotal is from 25th February, however,\nthe ISO file (with original name invitation.iso) was created most likely on 17th February in\nPacific Standard Timezone (UTC-08:00).\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 8: Evil ISO Sample\n\n## Delivery Method\n\nBased on similarities of analyzed ISO files we were able to find another similar files. It\nseems that at least some of them have been delivered via phishing emails with ISO/IMG\nattachments looking like Word documents. Moreover, it seems that the same threat actor\ndelivers at least one phishing email to the targets in Czech republic in March 2021.\n\nFig. 9: Example of email with similar attachement delivered to the private company\n\n## Findings and Summary\n\nWe were able to discover and track the campaign targeting Slovakia Government and\nCobalt Strike infrastructure used by the threat actor. This analysis was based solely on\npublicly available information, community threat intelligence sources and our own malware\nresearch. The incident and results have been reported to the local authorities such as\ncomputer security incident response team. The report included the collected indicators of\ncompromise such as hashes and IP addresses. These IOCs have been used during the\n\n\n-----\n\ninvestigation. Imagine, it is like the oraculum - you can predict which IP addresses will the\nattacker use in the next steps, or, you can use the reported IOCs as a pivots during the\nforensic analysis. All the results are only from the hunting in public sources.\n\n## DEF CON Talk\n\nFig. 10: Our talk at DEFCON 29 Recon Village\n\nWe presented this case at Recon Village at DEF CON 29 conference in August 2021 (Las\nVegas & Virtual). We also introduced and explained couple of concepts, tips and tricks for\nmalware hunting and advanced search. Presentation slides and video from our talk are\navailable below.\n\n[DEF CON 29 Recon Village Presentation Slides [PDF]](https://www.istrosec.com/files/defcon29-rv-ladislav_baco.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HMpePkNivjo\n\n## Afterword\n\n_(updated on Sep 13, 2021)_\n\nThis blog post was originally based on research and analysis during March and April 2021.\nTherefore, we published our results based only on data available at that time, without\nreferring to the results and articles published a few weeks and months later.\n\nFew days after DEF CON talk and after publishing this blog post, Slovak technology portal\n[Zive.sk wrote an article about this incident based on our research. Then,](https://zive.aktuality.sk/clanok/sj8m9vz/hackeri-utocili-na-slovenske-institucie-nastrojom-cobaltstrike-zneuzili-pri-tom-meno-nbu/) ESET Research\n[found that this attack targeted diplomats from more than 13 European countries and think-](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/mstic/master/Indicators/May21-NOBELIUM/May21NOBELIUMIoCs.csv)\ntanks and this attack was linked to APT29/Dukes/Nobelium also by Microsoft Threat\n[Intelligence Center. In their article from the end of May they published IOCs which contain](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/mstic/master/Indicators/May21-NOBELIUM/May21NOBELIUMIoCs.csv)\nalso some of the IOCs mentioned here, including “NSA” ISO Sample.\n\nAnd finally, Catalin Cimpanu from The Record published post “Russian cyberspies targeted\nthe Slovak government for months” based on above work.\n\n## Sample IOCs\n\n### Hashes\n\nbd05e95b88b41cad419d450b10f801c5: AktualizC!ciu.img\n\n\n-----\n\ned24b708a0abb91d2d984c646527823f: Aktualizáciu.lnk\ne55d9f6300fa32458b909fded48ec2c9: diassvcs.dll\n1adfe420043628286d0f3ff007113bfa: Cobalt Strike Beacon\nb0c12b32ed763e2fd9f0a1669f82d579: evil.iso\n038579bdb1de9e0ab541df532afeb50d: Programme outline.lnk\n72b494d0921296cdd5e4a07a0869b244: Plending forms.lnk\n600aceaddb22b9a1d6ae374ba7fc28c5: GraphicalComponent.dll\n\n### Domains\n\ncontent.pcmsar[.]net\ncbdnewsandreviews[.]net\n\n### IP Addresses\n\n51.79.69[.]211\n139.99.167[.]177\n\n## References\n\n\n-----",
