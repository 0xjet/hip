It grabs hex\ncharacters from elsewhere in the document, decodes them, and writes those strings to new\ncells. However in this case, the document only runs through two rounds of this decoding.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Round 1\n\nThe first round behaves pretty much the same as it did before. It checks to see if it’s in a\nsandbox, checks the registry, and if VBAWarnings is turned on, the code will go back to the\nloop and start round 2.\n\n## Round 2\n\nThis is where the main difference lies. A series of lines get written to a file called QP0L3.vbs\nand then executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## QP0L3.vbs\n\nThe code in the .vbs file is nothing that special. It’s just an array of URLs going through a For\n_Each loop. The file gets downloaded and then saved as an .html to the Temp folder._\n\n## Back to Round 2\n\nAt this point, the .html file is executed with what looks to be rundll32.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd that’s pretty much it! Again, not a major change, but I thought it was a noteworthy one.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n-----",
