Accellion cyber incident](https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/accellion-cyber-incident/)\n\nOn 15 January 2021, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) became\naware of a cyber security incident related to a server used by ASIC.\n\n## The incident\n\nOn 28 December 2020, an unidentified threat actor accessed an ASIC server containing\nattachments to Australian credit licence applications submitted to ASIC between 1 July 2020\nand 28 December 2020.\n\nThe cyber incident occurred due to a vulnerability in a file transfer appliance (FTA) provided\nby California-based Accellion and previously used by ASIC to receive attachments to\nAustralian credit licence applications.\n\nASIC engaged independent cyber experts to undertake a forensic investigation. Their\nanalysis has confirmed there is no evidence that the attachments to credit licence\napplications have been read or downloaded. This has not changed.\n\nWe were of the view in January 2021 that the filenames of these attachments may have\nbeen viewed.\n\nHowever, following additional analysis performed by ASIC’s independent cyber experts, it is\nhighly unlikely that the threat actors accessed any data held on the ASIC server, including\nfilenames of the attachments related to Australian credit licence applications submitted to\nASIC between 1 July 2020 and 28 December 2020.\n\n## Our response\n\nIn response to the incident, ASIC has:\n\ndisabled the relevant server;\n\n\n-----\n\nascertained that no other ASIC information technology (IT) infrastructure is impacted;\nprovided alternative arrangements for submitting attachments (see below);\nwritten to all identified credit licence applicants (via the contact email\naddress nominated by the applicant) to advise and update them about the incident;\nassessed the incident in accordance with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988;\ninformed relevant authorities; and\nengaged independent cybersecurity experts to complete a forensic investigation.\n\n## Who to contact\n\nASIC has written directly to impacted parties. If you require additional information, please\nemail [contactus@asic.gov.au](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:contactus@asic.gov.au)\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n[For more information, download frequently asked questions.](http://download.asic.gov.au/media/5971861/accellion-cyber-incident-faqs-15-feb-2021.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
