The company had to shut down some of its connected services\nand call centers following the attack.\n\n## New tooling helps bypass sanctions\n\n[CrowdStrike now linked the cybercrime gang to Hades ransomware based on \"significant](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker/)\ncode overlap.\" This new, previously unattributed malware tooling is helping Evil Corp\nbypass sanctions to monetize their attacks.\n\n[Hades ransomware is a 64-bit compiled variant of WastedLocker upgraded with](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trucking-giant-forward-air-hit-by-new-hades-ransomware-gang/)\nsupplementary code obfuscation and a few minor feature changes.\n\n\"Hades ransomware shares the majority of its functionality with WastedLocker; the ISFBinspired static configuration, multi-staged persistence/installation process, file/directory\nenumeration, and encryption functionality are largely unchanged,\" CrowdStrike said.\n\n\"Hades did receive minor modifications, and the removed features included those that were\nuniquely characteristic of INDRIK SPIDER’s previous ransomware families —\nWastedLocker and BitPaymer.\"\n\nWhen encrypting a victim's systems, Hades creates a ransom note named 'HOW-TODECRYPT-[extension].txt' resembling ransom notes dropped by REvil ransomware.\n\nThe ransom notes contain a URL that directs the victims to a Tor site with info about the\nattack and a Tox messenger address they can use to contact Evil Corp's operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hades**\n\n**Tor site (BleepingComputer)**\n\"INDRIK SPIDER’s move to this ransomware variant also came with another shift in tactics:\nthe departure from using email communication and the possibility of exfiltrating data from\nvictims to elicit payments,\" CrowdStrike added.\n\nBleepingComputer reported that Hades ransomware was used to encrypt trucking giant\nForward Air's systems in December 2020.\n\nWhile there aren't many Hades ransomware attacks being reported by affected\norganizations, Evil Corp victims have been using the ID-Ransomware service to check if\ntheir systems were hit by Hades ransomware since the group started using the new strain.\n\n_Image: ID-Ransomware_\n\"The continued development of WastedLocker ransomware is the latest attempt by the\nnotorious adversary to distance themselves from known tooling to aid them in bypassing the\nsanctions imposed upon them,\" CrowsStrike concluded.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sanctions and indictments have undoubtedly significantly impacted the group and\nhave made it difficult for INDRIK SPIDER to successfully monetize their criminal\nendeavors.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[US links Thanos and Jigsaw ransomware to 55-year-old doctor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-links-thanos-and-jigsaw-ransomware-to-55-year-old-doctor/)\n\n[US offers $15 million reward for info on Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-offers-15-million-reward-for-info-on-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[FBI: BlackCat ransomware breached at least 60 entities worldwide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-blackcat-ransomware-breached-at-least-60-entities-worldwide/)\n\n[Evil Corp](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/evil-corp/)\n[Hades](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hades/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Sanctions](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sanctions/)\n[USA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/usa/)\n[WastedLocker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/wastedlocker/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
