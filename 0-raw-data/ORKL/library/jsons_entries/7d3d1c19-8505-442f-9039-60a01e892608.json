SASFIS variants are also being sent via spammed messages such as the\nspoofed messages that purported to come from Facebook and iTunes Store. The said email\nmessages have a .ZIP file attachment that contained TROJ_SASFIS.HN.\n\nIt is also known to be associated with FAKEAV variants that are downloaded onto systems\nwhen visiting pornographic sites. Though viewed as a simple downloader, SASFIS opens\naffected systems to botnet attacks, particularly ZeuS and BREDOLAB.\n\nSASFIS have been spotted as early as 2009. Affected systems that may play part in botnet\noperations, are susceptible to data theft, and are difficult to clean up.\n\nCybercriminals behind the SASFIS malware use pay-per-install (PPI) and pay-per-access\n(PPA) business models to earn money.\n\nPPI business model: Cybercriminals behind other malware families like ZeuS and\nBREDOLAB pay SASFIS creators for other malware to be downloaded and installed on\nsystems that have been infected with SASFIS.\n\n\n-----\n\nPPA business model: SASFIS creators list a number of adult websites in the code of\nthe components downloaded by SASFIS variants. When a SASFIS-infected system\naccesses any of these websites, it redirects to any of the listed adult websites.\n\n##  TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Installation**\n\nThis Trojan drops the following files:\n\n%User Profile%\\Local Settings\\{random file name}.exe\n\n(Note: %User Profile% is the current user's profile folder, which is usually\nC:\\Windows\\Profiles\\{user name} on Windows 98 and ME, C:\\WINNT\\Profiles\\{user name}\non Windows NT, and C:\\Documents and Settings\\{user name} on Windows 2000, XP, and\nServer 2003.)\n\n**Other System Modifications**\n\nThis Trojan modifies the following registry entries:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\\n\nWindows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\n\nShell = \"Explorer.exe rundll32.exe {4 random letters}.{3 random letters} {6 random letters]}\"\n\n(Note: The default value data of the said registry entry is Explorer.exe.)\n\nIt also creates the following registry entry(ies) as part of its installation routine:\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\\n\nOffice\\11.0\\Word\\\n\nSecurity\n\nLevel = \"4\"\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\\n\nOffice\\11.0\\Word\\\n\nSecurity\n\nAccessVBOM = \"0\"\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\\n\nWindows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nSCardSvr = \"%User Profile%\\Local Settings\\{random file name}.exe\"\n\n**Other Details**\n\nThis Trojan connects to the following possibly malicious URL:\n\n\n-----\n\nhttp://www.google.com/{BLOCKED}mapandtet\nhttp://{BLOCKED}.{BLOCKED}.69.202:443/{5 random letters}.php?id={alphanumeric\nID}\nhttp://{BLOCKED}.{BLOCKED}.138.100:80/{5 random letters}.php?id={alphanumeric\nID}\n\n**Variant Information**\n\nThis Trojan has the following MD5 hashes:\n\n0280c89e03f255141a7d6fc400cfd51e\n4b0eb6b90c8dbeeaf5a870b7cdf77d00\nccf8b4c5d8fbcf4f16277f871ecf4197\neae86cc58b8ef8ad98b7db4dcf01102f\n\n\n-----",
