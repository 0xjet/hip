Trochilus RAT activity was discovered during\nboth months of October and November 2015.\n\n## Trochilus RAT source code available on GitHub\n\n\n-----\n\nAs for Trochilus itself, Arbor s team says that the RAT has mainly reverse shell features and\nexecutes in memory only, making it very hard to detect by classic antivirus solutions.\nNevertheless, some clues as to the intrusion are left behind and can be picked up by\nantivirus engines later on.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers were even able to get a hold of the malware's source code,\nand later linked it to a GitHub profile for a user named 5loyd.\n\nFrom [Trochilus' GitHub project page, we see that this is \"a fast&free Windows remote](https://github.com/5loyd/trochilus)\nadministration tool,\" coded in C++, which features support for various communications\nprotocols, single-threaded operation, a file manager module, a remote shell, a non-UAC\nmode, the capability to uninstall itself, get system info from remote computers, and to\ndownload, upload, and execute files.\n\nWe doubt that 5loyd is actually part of Group 27. It may be possible that the group just\nhijacked his source code and used it for their malicious purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Seven Pointed Dagger campaign_\n© 2001-2022 Softpedia. All rights reserved.
