Our decryptor has been helping victims to recover](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\ntheir files for free since its release.\n\nAfter a few months, [BleepingComputer wrote about a new variant of the Stupid](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-april-30th-2021-attacks-escalate/)\n[ransomware, called NoCry. This variant was found by GrujaRS. When we first analyzed](https://twitter.com/GrujaRS/status/1386238878252666881)\nthe Judge ransomware, we also found the alias: NoCry in the binary. As such, we went\nahead to analyze NoCry and determined that it is a variant of Judge as well.\n\nFortunately, our decryptor for Judge also decrypts files encrypted by the NoCry/Stupid\nransomware. In this blog post, we discuss some differences between Judge and NoCry.\nFurthermore, we confirm that our decryptor also decrypts files affected by NoCry.\n\n## Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NoCry ransomware we analyzed is very similar to Judge, the one we previously\nlooked at. It creates a mutex to prevent multiple instances from running in parallel,\nprovides sandbox detection and deletes system restore points. When those tasks are\ncompleted, the ransomware starts encrypting the victim’s files. The file encryption process\nis the same, and therefore, our decryptor can also be used for NoCry.\n\n### Some slight differences\n\nLooking closely, there are a couple of interesting differences between NoCry and the\nJudge ransomware we previously analyzed. For example, the mutex this time is:\n“rGoB8VnbP6W42hW5”. Furthermore, the screen displayed to the user after file\nencryption is completed is different.\n\nThe screen displayed above is very similar to the one displayed by the WannaCry\nransomware. The structure and colors of the screen are similar, and the countdown\nWannaCry presents is also 72 hours.\n\nWe found that the countdown in NoCry is a little bit different from the one presented by\nJudge. The ransom note screen of the previously analyzed Judge ransomware is\ndisplayed below. As we can see, the text above the countdown is: “Time left before the\nprice goes up”. In the NoCry ransomware, the text changed to: “Your files will be lost on”,\nmaking the threat more serious.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen these 72 hours pass, the ransomware deletes itself from the infected system. The\n“Decrypt” button on the ransom note screen is the only way for a victim to restore its files\nvia the intended route. Therefore, once the 72 hours pass, the victim can no longer\nperform decryption. Using our decryptor however, decryption is still possible.\n\n### A free decryptor\n\nThe file encryption process did not change, so the decryptor only requires some minor\nadjustments. Therefore, our current decryptor also decrypts (non-corrupted) files affected\nby this NoCry/Stupid variant. The decryptor remains free of charge and will be available\nvia the [NoMoreRansom initiative soon.](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoC)\n\n**Indicator** **Value**\n\n\nSHA256 of\nransomware\n\nCommand &\ncontrol\nhostname\n\n\nf2a842eb78e2be3cd1d638a3dabcf21f8fbc35dcd768bb772f5e6080d1f246cc\n\nniddle-noddle-eyes[.]000webhostapp[.]com\n\n\n[© 2022 Tesorion Cybersecurity Solutions.
