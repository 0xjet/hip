Less well understood is the world of\nremote ‘zero-click’ attacks, pushed to and executed automatically on devices anywhere in the world, via cloud messaging\nservices such as iMessage and WhatsApp.\n\nWhile a few examples have come to light in recent years, there are still open questions about how common the attacks are,\nand strategies to detect them. Over the past two years, Amnesty International and Citizen Lab have forensically examined\nhundreds of devices, and have developed techniques to hunt for signs of compromise in phone logs.\n\nOur results indicate that NSO Group, a company that sells mobile attack tools to governments, has successfully fielded\nzero-click zero-day exploits against every major version of iOS starting from iOS 10, up to and including iOS 14.\n\nWe explain how we were able to reconstruct a partial timeline of NSO Group’s zero-click activity on iPhones through\nforensic analysis of compromised devices. We also provide some technical details about the attacks, based on analysis of\nindicators left behind, and discuss some of the challenges and limitations of this ‘digital archaeology’.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nNSO Group has been a regular item in the news since its Pegasus mobile phone spyware was first discovered and publicly\nanalysed in 2016, when it was used against Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor [1]. NSO Group sells Pegasus exclusively to\ngovernments, and advertises that Pegasus can break into the latest phones with ‘zero clicks’, meaning that the target does\nnot need to take any action (such as clicking on a link) to become infected. NSO Group is reported to have some 700\nemployees, and research by Citizen Lab and Amnesty International has shown Pegasus in use by dozens of governments\naround the world, making NSO Group the largest known private sector mobile threat actor as of 2021.\n\nThough NSO Group says that Pegasus is designed to facilitate surveillance of criminals and terrorists, the Pegasus spyware\nis routinely abused to target members of civil society. Combined, Amnesty International and Citizen Lab have analysed\nmore than 1,000 devices, leveraging trust relationships with civil society organizations, and found hundreds with traces of\nPegasus. We have documented Pegasus abuse by suspected government operators in more than a dozen countries, including\nMexico, El Salvador, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Morocco, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, India, Israel and Palestine,\nKazakhstan, Thailand, Azerbaijan, and Togo. We found devices infected with Pegasus from 2014 through 2021, and with\nzero-click exploits from 2017 through 2021. This offers us a rich set of previously infected devices on which to conduct\n‘exploit archaeology’, the process of understanding what capabilities were historically fielded to compromise devices.\n\nWhile Amnesty International and Citizen Lab typically work independently, with separate technical processes, this report is\na joint analysis of forensic artifacts we have collected over several years. We began preparing this report in March 2022 by\ncomparing our respective forensic observations. Our goal in this analysis was to study the evolution of a ‘top-tier’ mobile\nthreat actor’s capabilities over time. How often does NSO Group field zero-click capabilities against the latest mobile\ndevices? How long do these capabilities last? How vulnerable are users who scrupulously install the latest updates? What\nvectors or techniques do the exploits use? We approached this exploit archaeology from two different angles. First, we\nlooked for artifacts and generic signatures left behind by the spyware itself, including process names used by the Pegasus\nspyware. Second, we correlated these artifacts with additional artifacts apparently left behind by exploits.\n\nWe are able to identify at least six distinct zero-click exploits deployed against iOS versions 10 through 14, as well as the\nwell-known WhatsApp zero-click deployed against Android devices. While the WhatsApp zero-click was detected and\npatched by Meta in April 2019, we found the first public technical indications that it was active as early as July 2018.\nHowever, we show that not all ‘zero clicks’ have this sort of longevity. Despite the mystique behind NSO Group, we find\nthat there appear to be significant gaps in time – in one case eight months – where the company’s customers appear unable\nto field zero-click exploits against the latest iOS versions, and must resort to ‘one -click’ exploits via malicious links.\n\nOur paper has the following contributions and findings:\n\n_•_ **Zero-click characterization:** We show that NSO Group customers have fielded six distinct zero-click exploits for iOS in\nthe wild since at least 2017. This predates the first public domain research about the iMessage zero-click attack surface by\nat least two years. While details of some of these exploits have been previously published, we provide new details.\n\n_•_ **Observed update deficit:** Where we have sufficient data, we define a per-exploit metric that we call ‘observed update\n_deficit’. The metric encapsulates how many days fully up-to-date devices were vulnerable-in-practice to the exploit_\nwhile it was being deployed in the wild.\n\n_•_ **Possible Project Zero bug collision: Through use of our observed update deficit metric, we demonstrate that Google**\n_Project Zero’s 2019 investigation of the iPhone’s zero-click attack surface may have significantly disrupted NSO_\nGroup’s activities.\n\n_• WhatsApp exploitation in 2018: By correlating Android crash logs from a known Pegasus target with Pegasus Project_\nrecords, we identify a likely case of the WhatsApp missed-call hack (CVE-2019-3568) from July 2018. Meta detected\nand patched the exploit in April 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nZero-click attacks have actively been deployed against human rights defenders and civil society for more than half a decade\nwith little public analysis. By focusing on one particular firm, NSO Group, we will outline what we can learn from exploit\narchaeology. Continued close collaboration between human rights defenders, civil society investigators and private sector\nsecurity researchers can help all sides gain a better understanding of the capabilities of private sector offensive actors.\n\n**SECTION 1: WHAT ARE ZERO-CLICK ATTACKS?**\n\nIn this paper we focus on remote ‘zero-click’ attacks, which we define as any exploits or techniques that allow a remote\nattacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on a target device without requiring interaction from the user being targeted. A\nremote zero-click attack can potentially target any attack surface on the device that is reachable over any network to which\nthe device is connected. In practice, we have seen threat actors favour messaging apps such as iMessage or WhatsApp,\nwhich are widely used, and generally automatically process complex data pushed to them by untrusted contacts. In the past,\nexploits have targeted iMessage’s attachment processing and WhatsApp’s cryptographic negotiation for video calls.\n\nOf course, any remote exploitation vector targeting a modern device will need to chain multiple distinct vulnerabilities\nresponsible for different stages of the attack. These stages include gaining initial code execution, escaping any sandbox or\nprocess isolation, escalating to gain kernel code execution, and bypassing code signature verification on the device. For\nmany of the cases we outline in this paper, we classify exploits based on their initial mechanisms and not based on any\nsubsequent stages. If an exploit chain’s subsequent stages change during the lifetime of the initial mechanism, we consider\nthese to be the ‘same exploit’. Conversely, subsequent stages may be reused even if the initial mechanism changes, and we\nwill consider these to be ‘different exploits’.\n\nIn this paper, we do not focus on techniques such as browser exploits delivered automatically via network injection. While\nthese attacks are technically zero-clicks, we do not consider them to be remote, as they require the attacker to have a\nvantage point on the network. Since at least 2011, spyware companies have advertised network injection appliances that\ncan be installed in ISP backbones or local networks [2]. Researchers have observed these devices used in Turkey [3], Egypt\n\n[4] and Morocco [5], to deliver spyware-laden executable files and browser exploits. This technique may become\nincreasingly popular for domestic targeting as states deploy necessary physical infrastructure, and as costs for remote\nzero-click capabilities increase.\n\n**A public history of ‘zero-click’ in the wild**\n\nThe earliest discussion of zero-click attacks targeting mobile phones appears to be in a 2010 NSO Group proposal for\nPegasus, which mentioned a zero-click capability targeting BlackBerry devices via the FOTA (firmware over-the-air)\nfeature. However, it is unclear if this capability was truly remote, or whether it involved cooperation from the target’s\nmobile provider.[1]\n\nA 2013 Pegasus brochure describes an ‘over-the-air’ (OTA) installation technique: ‘a push message is remotely and\ncovertly sent to the mobile device.’ The technique is said to require ‘no cooperation or engagement of the target’ [6]. This\nOTA installation technique may have made use of WAP Push messages.[2] Specifically, a WAP Push service-loading message\ncan be used to force a target’s device to open a web browser in the background and navigate it to a specified URL. The\nopened link could then automatically load a more traditional ‘one-click’ browser exploit.\n\nFeatures such as WAP Push allow exploit developers to convert a one-click browser exploit into a zero-click capability,\nwithout the need for any additional exploits. Additionally, it is generally believed that browser exploits are easier to find\nthan exploits for chat apps such as iMessage or WhatsApp, as a browser’s attack surface is orders of magnitude larger.\n\nFortunately, most newer phones do not perform any action upon receipt of a WAP Push message. Nevertheless, we\ndemonstrate that the browser remains an important component used by zero-click attacks. A number of novel zero-click\nexploits we have identified include a ‘pivot-to-WebKit’, where the focus of the initial zero-click phase appears to be solely\non launching a browser instance and navigating it to a specified URL. Additional browser exploits then complete the\nexploitation of the target device.\n\nPublic documents and reporting show that other offensive actors beyond NSO Group have also been interested in\ndeveloping and marketing zero-click capabilities against mobile devices. An undated brochure from German spyware\ncompany FinFisher describes a proposed zero-click capability targeting a 2016-2017 version of iOS, 10.0 [8]. Zerodium, an\nexploit broker, announced publicly in August 2017 that it would purchase iPhone remote zero-click exploit chains for up to\n1.5 million USD [9]. Additionally, a 2019 report about Memento Labs, the successor company to Hacking Team, mentions\n_Android spyware called ‘Krait’ that is designed to be delivered via a zero-click exploit [10]._\n\nAlso, Reuters has published extensively on Project Raven, a hacking campaign linked to the UAE government that made\nuse of zero-click exploits. Project Raven exploited at least two iPhone zero-click vulnerabilities, incorporated into spyware\ntools that the threat actors named KARMA and KARMA2. The vulnerability exploited by KARMA likely targeted iOS 9\n\n1 We located what appears to be a 2010 NSO Group Pegasus brochure on VirusTotal, SHA256: 8d7226d501d3964c9a51742a0ac3783f122bb0003c7\nd8822e2373b27fc8367bc.\n2 Some Pegasus samples for Android contain code to delete WAP Push messages from a device after successful infection, see [7].\n\n\n-----\n\nand was patched by Apple in September 2016. The vulnerability exploited by KARMA2 likely targeted iOS 10 and was\nsaid to be patched around August 2017 [11], though we cannot identify any iOS update released in the month of August.\nOne of the exploits used was reportedly developed and sold by a US-based company, Accuvant [12]. KARMA and\nKARMA2’s reported targets included journalists at the BBC and Al Jazeera [13].\n\nNSO Group’s first post-WAP zero-click offering appears to have been its ‘Pegasus 3’ system, released in 2017 [14].\nSubsequent NSO Group exploits have attracted media attention, including a 2019 WhatsApp exploit [15], and the 2021\nForcedEntry exploit [16].\n\n**SECTION 2: OUR EXPLOIT ARCHAEOLOGY METHODOLOGY**\n\nWe began our exploit archaeology by identifying a set of common Pegasus identifiers, including items such as process names,\nthat we attribute to NSO Group’s Pegasus payload. As they are features of the payload and not the exploits, these identifiers\nare expected to be long-lived beyond a single exploit campaign. Identification and attribution of these artifacts to NSO Group\nis beyond the scope of this paper, but examples include [17] and [18], and the techniques used generally involve tracing the\nartifacts back to known ground truth attributed to NSO Group, including web servers from which the exploits were delivered.\n\nWe next look for exploit identifiers associated with the initial vector that are temporally adjacent or otherwise related to the\ncommon Pegasus identifiers. If suspected exploit identifiers are not related to the common Pegasus identifiers, we exclude\nthem from our process. In this way, we exclude exploitation that may be associated with other threat actors.\n\n**Differentiation of exploits**\n\nFor each exploit, we identify a specific test, which we believe corresponds with the exploit. Some specific tests may require\ngathering forensic data beyond what Amnesty International or Citizen Lab typically gather from target devices. For\ninstance, some specific tests may require data only available after jailbreaking the device. In these cases, we sometimes\nextrapolate using a general assumption that only one NSO Group zero-click is actively deployed against a given iOS\nversion at a given time.\n\nFor example, if we see compromises of iOS 14 in 2021 that we link to NSO Group, and there were indications that Pegasus\nwas delivered to the phone via some zero-click exploit, then we assume for the purposes of our analysis here that the\nPegasus traces we observe are the result of the ForcedEntry exploit (see Section 8), even if we have not verified the specific\npresence of coretelephony cache files, which is our specific ForcedEntry test. We believe that this is a valid assumption, as\nwe have verified our specific ForcedEntry test on a selection of phones with iOS versions 14.4 through 14.7.1 compromised\nbetween January and November 2021.\n\n**Determination of phone’s iOS version on specific dates**\n\nTo compute our observed update deficit metric, we must first identify which version of iOS the phone was running at the\ntime of exploitation. While iOS does not have high-fidelity logs detailing the full update history of the device, there are a\nvariety of other forensic artifacts that can be helpful in this regard. Nevertheless, the process of assigning specific iOS\nversions to dates can be somewhat difficult, particularly further back in time.\n\n**Limitations of forensic archaeology**\n\nWe may not see all NSO Group exploits. NSO Group may maintain a suite of different Pegasus payloads after exploitation.\nIt is not clear that we can detect all of their payloads, and some exploits might have been deployed in conjunction only with\ncertain (more limited) payloads, rendering them invisible to us. This may cause us to miss certain exploits or underestimate\ncertain NSO activity.\n\nOur observed update deficit metric may also be an underestimate. The same exploits may be sold to different customers at\ndifferent times, or authorized for use in different regions at different times. Thus, our observations might miss some of\nthese early usages of an exploit. Additionally, transient regulatory or licensing concerns might impact territories authorized\nfor deployment of a particular exploit.\n\nImplicit in our metric is an assumption that exploitability of a target phone is a function of the version of its operating\nsystem or software. This seems a reasonable assumption where the exploit does not appear to rely on server-side behaviour,\nsuch as a malicious attachment delivered in an end-to-end encrypted fashion via iMessage (see Section 8). However, cases\nsuch as the WhatsApp exploit (see Section 9), in which the exploit is delivered via the control plane, can be mitigated\nwithout updates to client software.\n\nOur methodology could theoretically conflate two different exploits. While we generally assume that there is a pre-exploit\nfingerprinting step before the exploit is launched, there may be cases where pre-exploit fingerprinting is not possible or\ndesirable. Thus, multiple NSO exploits may be fired at the device simultaneously or quickly in sequence. This could cause\ncases where temporal correlation leads us to incorrectly link forensic identifiers from two distinct NSO Group exploits\ntogether.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is an inherent limitation in attempting to understand disruptions to NSO Group, such as one we describe in Section 5.\nJust as NSO Group attempts to operate silently, some defenders may attempt to disrupt NSO Group and may not disclose\ntheir efforts. For example, it appears that the Government of Turkey may have observed successful Pegasus attacks in 2019\nand blocked some Pegasus installation websites and command-and-control servers [18]. Furthermore, third-party\ninfrastructure vendors sometimes become aware of NSO Group activity [19] and take steps to ban the activity from their\nplatforms. Because we cannot be aware of the full spectrum of efforts to disrupt NSO Group, a visibility bias may lead us\nto misattribute observed disruptions.\n\n**SECTION 3: IOS 10 GOLDENGATE IMESSAGE EXPLOIT**\n\n**First observed deployment** 5 July 2017 (successful)\n\n**Last observed deployment** December 2017 (successful)\n\n**First non-vulnerable version** _iOS 10.3.3 or earlier_\n\n**Total observed update deficit** Insufficient data\n\n**Specific test** Presence of ‘GoldenGate’ in historical data about running processes (e.g. DataUsage.\nsqlite. There may be related com.apple.madrid lookups related to the iMessage service\nin the IDStatusCache file.\n\nThe earliest Pegasus zero-click attack we observed occurred in July 2017 against iOS 10. It is difficult to identify the\nparticularities of the attack vector due to the age of the attack but we can infer that the exploit delivery involved iMessage.\n\nAn attacker-controlled iCloud account was looked up by the targeted device shortly before successful Pegasus infection.\nThe attacker email address was logged under the iMessage (com.apple.madrid) service in the ‘com.apple.\nidentityservices.idstatuscache.plist’ file. We will refer to this log file as the ‘IDStatusCache’ file.[3]\n\nOur specific test for this exploit is the presence of the process name ‘GoldenGate’ in the iPhone’s ‘com.apple.\nosanalytics.addaily.plist’ or ‘DataUsage.sqlite’ file, followed by an additional Pegasus process name such as\n‘pcsd’.\n\nWe have not observed a ‘GoldenGate’ process more recently than September 2017, although some GoldenGate targets\nshowed signs of related successful compromises until December 2017. It is unclear whether this vulnerability was patched\nby Apple or otherwise became inoperable.\n\nOne individual was compromised with this zero-click attack multiple times in the summer of 2017 until they upgraded to\n_iOS 10.3.3. After the upgrade, the operator switched to sending one-click Pegasus exploit links over SMS. The evidence_\nsuggests this vector was either patched or not reliable against later versions of iOS 10.\n\n**SECTION 4: IOS 11 THUMPER EXPLOIT**\n\n**First observed deployment** January 2018 (attempted), February 2018 (successful)\n\n**Last observed deployment** December 2018 (successful), January 2019 (attempted)\n\n**First non-vulnerable version** No successful attack observed targeting iOS 12\n\n**Total observed update deficit** Insufficient data\n\n**Specific test** Presence of ‘com.apple.thumper’ lookup for malicious iCloud accounts in the\nIDStatusCache file.\n\nDuring our forensic investigations we observed that suspicious iCloud accounts were interacting with Pegasus-infected\n_iPhones using the ‘com.apple.thumper’ service, which appears to be the internal Apple name for the Wi-Fi Calling_\n(VoWiFi) feature on iOS.\n\nThe earliest presence of malicious Thumper lookups in the ‘IDStatusCache’[4] file began in mid-January 2018 and\ncontinued until at least January 2019. The last successful exploitation observed using this technique occurred in December\n2018 targeting an iOS 11 device.\n\nInterestingly, the Wi-Fi Calling feature on iOS is configurable by the mobile carrier. Some carriers may not enable the use\nof Wi-Fi calling on their networks. It is unclear whether an operator configuration would limit the operation of the Pegasus\nVoWiFi exploit.\n\n3 The IDStatusCache file can contain historical records for accounts interfacing with a particular phone. NSO Group creates compartmentalized\ninfrastructure such as domains and email addresses for each customer. The identification of the same Pegasus-linked iCloud account on multiple\ntargets can be used to determine that all were targeted by the same Pegasus operator or customer. More information about this file is available at [17].\n4 The idstatuscache.plist file on iOS records when the Apple device interacted with other iCloud accounts. /private/var/mobile/Library/\nPreferences/com.apple.identityservices.idstatuscache.plist\n\n|First observed deployment|5 July 2017 (successful)|\n|---|---|\n|Last observed deployment|December 2017 (successful)|\n|First non-vulnerable version|iOS 10.3.3 or earlier|\n|Total observed update deficit|Insufficient data|\n|Specific test|Presence of ‘GoldenGate’ in historical data about running processes (e.g. DataUsage. sqlite.

In a later\nexploit we will see that NSO Group successfully exploited a flaw in the WhatsApp VOIP stack to deliver a different\nzero-click attack. One hypothesis is that NSO Group was able to find and exploit an earlier flaw in the VOIP stack used\nby iOS.\n\nThe VoWiFi calling feature also allows calling from non-cellular devices (such as laptops) that are connected to the same\n_iCloud account as the cellular device. The VoWiFi protocol requires communication between the cellular device, the iCloud_\nservices and the mobile carrier, which opens a complex attack surface for potential exploitation by a remote attacker.\n\n**SECTION 5: IOS 12 IMESSAGE EXPLOIT**\n\n**First observed deployment** March 2019\n\n**Last observed deployment** July 2020\n\n**Total observed update deficit** 75 days\n\n**Earliest exploited version** 12.1.4\n\n**First non-vulnerable version** Likely mitigated in iOS 12.4.1\n\n**Specific test** Presence of the file /private/var/root/Library/Preferences/\nroleaccountd.plist. This file is available in an iOS backup in the RootDomain.\nThis file is written once upon first-run of the exploit on the device.\n\nNSO Group successfully deployed a reliable zero-click exploit targeting iOS 12 from 14 March 2019 at the latest. The\nexploit was successfully deployed as a zero-day against iOS 12.1.4 in late March 2019. Extensive attacks using this exploit\nwere observed targeting vulnerable devices until at least July 2020.\n\n**Version** **First known exploitation of** **Next iOS version released** **Observed update deficit**\n**version**\n\niOS 12.1.4 2019-03-22 2019-03-25 4 days\n\niOS 12.2 2019-04-18 2019-05-13 26 days\n\niOS 12.3.1 2019-06-10 2019-07-22 43 days\n\niOS 12.4 2019-08-25 2019-08-26 2 days\n\nThis attack appears to have been highly reliable. Artifacts indicating successful Pegasus infection were observed seconds\nafter the attack was initiated against the target device.\n\nRecords from IDStatusCache files show that Pegasus-linked iMessage accounts interacted with the target device shortly\nbefore successful exploitation in many cases. This strongly suggests that this particular attack was again delivered over\n_iMessage. A distinctive roleaccountd.plist file was dropped by Pegasus during the first successful use of this exploit_\nagainst a target device.\n\nThe exploit shows evidence of the pivot-to-WebKit technique. Process database records indicate that the Apple Podcast app\nwas often launched seconds after the initial iMessage connection from the attacker. This attack continued to be deployed\nagainst still-vulnerable versions of iOS 12 until at least summer 2020. In July 2020 the attacker switched from launching\nthe Apple Podcast app to instead opening the Apple Music app during the exploitation process.\n\nA high-profile Azerbaijani journalist was targeted with this exploit in July 2020. A jailbreak of the journalist’s device\nrevealed a web request cache file tied to Apple Music [17]. This cache file contained records of HTTP requests to a\npreviously identified Pegasus infection domain.\n\nThe URL extension suggests that an HTML-based browser exploit was loaded inside the Apple Music process space. The\ninfection URL also shows clear structural similarities to URLs identified in other NSO Group zero-click attacks using\ndifferent attack vectors.\n\n|First observed deployment|March 2019|\n|---|---|\n|Last observed deployment|July 2020|\n|Total observed update deficit|75 days|\n|Earliest exploited version|12.1.4|\n|First non-vulnerable version|Likely mitigated in iOS 12.4.1|\n|Specific test|Presence of the file /private/var/root/Library/Preferences/ roleaccountd.plist.

The journalist was\nusing an iPhone 6, which was not supported by iOS 13. The individual was exploited very extensively with Pegasus for 17\nmonths until they upgraded to iOS version 12.4.7, which included the iOS 12.4.1 patch. Their device remained on an iOS 12\nversion for the next year and was not successfully exploited again. This case suggests that NSO Group did not prioritize\ndeveloping a new zero-click capability against the older iOS 12 release after the initial iOS 12 vulnerability was patched.\n\n**Did a bug collision disrupt hacking of civil society?**\n\nIn July 2019 Google Project Zero disclosed a number of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in iMessage involving the\ndeserialization of NSKeyedUnarchiver objects when parsing iMessage payloads. The disclosures were the result of a\nzero-click exploit chain built by Project Zero in order to test iMessage’s exploitability, rather than one discovered in the\nwild. While Apple introduced mitigations or fixes for many of these specific vulnerabilities in iOS 12.4, one of the\nunderlying design flaws which allowed the deserialization child classes during NSUnarchiving [20] was not mitigated until\n_iOS 12.4.1, and was not fully fixed until iOS 13.2 [21]._\n\nWe did not observe any successful use of NSO Group’s iOS 12 iMessage exploit chain against any devices running iOS\nversion 12.4.1 or higher. Furthermore, NSO Group’s initial iOS 13 zero-click exploit (see Section 6) appears to have been\nfixed in iOS 13.2, and this fix appears to have preceded a period of at least eight months during which we can identify no\nzero-day, zero-click exploits fielded by NSO Group customers (see Section 7).\n\nThough it is hard to be sure, as we are not in possession of NSO Group’s iOS 12 and iOS 13 exploits, this apparent\ndisruption suggests that researchers at Project Zero may have independently identified a remote attack surface under active\nexploitation by a mercenary threat actor. By identifying and disclosing these vulnerabilities to Apple, Google Project Zero\nmay have disrupted NSO Group’s exploit pipeline, and in doing so, may have disrupted NSO Group customers’ ongoing\nglobal attacks against journalists and civil society.\n\nThis is an indication that offensive security research of the type undertaken by Project Zero may provide direct safety\nbenefits to end-users by blocking real-world attacks. It also demonstrates the value of vulnerability root-cause analysis. The\nhardening of high-risk or exploitable design features can disrupt multiple offensive exploit chains and can require\nsignificant investment from threat actors to find new exploitable attack surfaces.\n\n**SECTION 6: IOS 13.1.3 PHOTOSTREAM EXPLOIT**\n\n**First observed deployment** 29 October 2019\n\n**Last observed deployment** May 2020 (successful), September 2020 (attempted)\n\n**Total observed update deficit 10 days**\n\n**Earliest exploited version** _iOS 13.1.3_\n\n**First non-vulnerable version** _iOS 13.2_\n\n**Specific test** Evidence of com.apple.mediastream.mstreamd _WebKit cache files containing_\nPegasus domain names (successful exploitation). Evidence of com.apple.private.\nalloy.photostream idstatuscache lookups containing Pegasus email addresses\n(targeting attempt).\n\nNSO Group continued to develop zero-click capabilities against iOS 13 devices following the suspected patching of the\n_iOS12 iMessage chain in iOS 12.4.1. Our forensic evidence shows that NSO Group pivoted from iMessage to a different_\nattack surface: the iPhone’s built-in functionality for photo sharing.\n\n**Version** **First known exploitation of version** **Next iOS version released** **Observed update deficit**\n\niOS 13.1.3 2019-10-18 2019-10-28 10 days\n\nBeginning in late October 2019, we observed lookups for suspicious iCloud email addresses in the IDStatusCache file\nunder the com.apple.private.alloy.photostream service. The photostream service is responsible for the shared\nalbum feature in Apple Photos, where a user can create a shared photo album and invite other iCloud users to view or\ncontribute to the shared album.\n\nAfter the initial photostream lookup, network traffic from the com.apple.mobileslideshow app was recorded in the\nDataUsage database, often for the first time. In case of successful exploitation, we observed traces associated with the\nPegasus ‘bh’ process on the phone. Our research has repeatedly observed ‘bh’ process records following successful\none-click browser exploits.\n\nWith this Photostream attack we again see evidence of the pivot-to-WebKit technique. After apparently delivering an exploit\nvia the photostream service, the exploit launched a WebKit instance in the com.apple.mediastream.mstreamd process.\n\n|First observed deployment|29 October 2019|\n|---|---|\n|Last observed deployment|May 2020 (successful), September 2020 (attempted)|\n|Total observed update deficit|10 days|\n|Earliest exploited version|iOS 13.1.3|\n|First non-vulnerable version|iOS 13.2|\n|Specific test|Evidence of com.apple.mediastream.mstreamd WebKit cache files containing Pegasus domain names (successful exploitation).

The scaffolding was fetched\nfrom /[uniqueid]/stadium/goblin. After performing tests to identify the local device model, the scaffolding fetched the\n_WebKit exploit from /[uniqueid]/stadium/eutopia._\n\nWe recovered the JavaScript scaffolding from an infected phone. The scaffolding includes a Pegasus infection domain name\nthat we previously identified. The browser exploit was downloaded from a URL containing path /[uniqueid]/stadium.\nThis URL path was also observed in the iOS 12 iMessage attack.\n\n_Apple introduced Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, which aims to protect users most at risk from sophisticated targeted attacks_\nsuch as Pegasus. As part of the mitigations, Apple has disabled the shared albums feature in Apple Photos and new shared\nalbum invitations will be blocked while Lockdown Mode is active.\n\n**S ECTION 7: IOS 13.5.1 IMTRANSCODERAGENT EXPLOIT (KISMET)**\n\n**First observed deployment** July 2020\n\n**Last observed deployment** December 2020\n\n**Total observed update deficit** 14 days\n\n**Earliest exploited version** _iOS 13.5.1_\n\n**First non-vulnerable version** Likely unexploitable in iOS 14 due to introduction of the Blastdoor sandbox\n\n**Specific test** Particular contents of IMTranscoderAgent.plist file\n\nOur exploit archaeology shows a zero-click campaign using an iOS13 iMessage exploit with deployments between July\n2020 and December 2020. We characterize this exploit by traces that it leaves behind in the IMTranscoderAgent.plist\nfile on the phone, which is visible in an iTunes backup.\n\nWe identified two periods during which the exploit was widely deployed as a zero-day. We saw deployments against iOS\n_13.5.1 beginning on 5 July 2020. This was the latest available version of iOS for 11 days, through 15 July 2020, when iOS_\n_13.6 was released. Starting on 14 September 2020, we saw deployments of the exploit against iOS 13.7, which was the_\nlatest version for three more days. We saw no deployments against iOS 13.6 when it was the latest iOS version, though we\nare unsure why. We do not believe that the issue is due to a lack of visibility, as forensics showed the exploit used as a\nzero-day by multiple suspected customers, including customers we suspect are linked to Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia,\nEl Salvador and Spain. We compute the observed update deficit below.\n\n**Version** **First known exploitation of version** **Next iOS version released** **Observed update deficit**\n\niOS 13.5.1 2020-07-05 2020-07-15 11 days\n\niOS 13.7 2020-09-14 2020-09-16 3 days\n\nDeployment of the exploit involved sending malicious attachments to a target iPhone via iMessage. These attachments\nwere processed by IMTranscoderAgent, the iMessage component that handles generation of previews for media in\nattachments. Somehow, the malicious attachments appear to have coaxed IMTranscoderAgent to automatically open a\n_WebKit instance in the background, and navigate to a Pegasus infection URL._\n\nThe exploit consisted, broadly, of two different types of attachments. Type A attachments were a JPEG gadget of 2,393\nbytes whose sole purpose appeared to be causing a trivial crash in IMTranscoderAgent, and Type B attachments were\npairs of attachments of varying sizes that we suspect contained malicious code. Before the exploit was fired, 25 Type A\nattachments were delivered to the device, in order to cause 25 trivial crashes in the IMTranscoderAgent process, thus\ntriggering a crash reporter rate-limit and disabling further crash reporting for this process. When the exploit was fired, each\npair of Type B attachments was preceded with a Type A attachment, likely to ensure that IMTranscoderAgent was freshly\ninitialized to a predictable state.\n\nEvery Type A attachment caused the following trivial crash, which we believe is essentially immaterial to the exploit, in the\nsame way that ForcedEntry’s PSD gadget turned out to be immaterial to that exploit (see Section 8).\n\n|First observed deployment|July 2020|\n|---|---|\n|Last observed deployment|December 2020|\n|Total observed update deficit|14 days|\n|Earliest exploited version|iOS 13.5.1|\n|First non-vulnerable version|Likely unexploitable in iOS 14 due to introduction of the Blastdoor sandbox|\n|Specific test|Particular contents of IMTranscoderAgent.plist file|\n\n|Version|First known exploitation of version|Next iOS version released|Observed update deficit|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|iOS 13.5.1|2020-07-05|2020-07-15|11 days|\n|iOS 13.7|2020-09-14|2020-09-16|3 days|\n\n\n-----\n\nWe identified two instances of the following crash from one subtype of Type B attachments. No other Type B attachments\nappear to have caused crashes:\n\nIMTranscoderAgent: (CoreFoundation) +[NSKeyedUnarchiver\nbserverWithCenter:queue:name:object:block:]: unrecognized selector sent to class 0x20af6b4b0\n\nThe selector specified in the above log message is missing the ‘o’ letter in the identifier observerWithCenter. We are\nunsure what caused this, but it could be due to a memory offset error.\n\nEventually, an instance of Type B attachments caused IMTranscoderAgent to open a WebKit instance and download\nmultiple items including: a 51KB initial payload and a 528KB subsequent payload. Approximately ten seconds after the\n528KB payload was downloaded, we again saw traces associated with the Pegasus bridgehead process (‘bh’) on the\nphone.

No specific test for 14.7 and higher.[5]\n\nOur exploit archaeology identified a long-lived iOS 14 exploit, deployed from January through November 2021. The\nexploit was deployed against at least four iOS versions while these versions were the latest available. Amnesty International\nand Citizen Lab independently observed this iOS 14 zero-click vulnerability being used in the wild beginning in early 2021.\n_Amnesty International refers to this exploit as Megalodon and Citizen Lab refers to this exploit chain as ForcedEntry._\n\n**Version** **First known** **Next iOS version released** **Observed update deficit**\n**exploitation of version**\n\niOS 14.4 2021-02-10 2021-03-08 26 days\n\niOS 14.4.2 2021-04-07 2021-04-26 27 days\n\niOS 14.6 2021-05-31 2021-07-19 50 days[6]\n\niOS 14.7.1 2021-08-17 2021-09-13 28 days\n\nThe exploit’s extraordinary longevity (there were approximately 131 days in 2021 that your phone was vulnerable even if\nyou scrupulously installed all latest updates) may be attributable to its novel architecture.\n\nAs in Section 7, the exploit consisted, broadly, of two different types of attachments. Type C attachments were an Adobe\nPSD gadget of 748 bytes, and Type D attachments were Adobe PDF files of varying sizes containing JBIG2 streams. Before\nthe exploit was fired, crash reporting was disabled with 25 Type C attachments. When the exploit was fired, each Type D\nattachment was preceded with a Type C attachment, likely to ensure that IMTranscoderAgent was freshly initialized to a\npredictable state. We observed instances where a Type D attachment arrived before a Type C attachment, or the same\nattachment arrived twice.\n\nA Google Project Zero write-up on a copy of the exploit captured in March 2021 revealed a novel custom Turing machine\narchitecture implemented using JBIG2 segment commands [22]. Multiple JBIG2 segment commands are chained in the\nexploit to implement a sequence of logical bit operations on arbitrary memory. The logical bit operations are then\nabstracted to create a higher level computer architecture to search memory and perform arithmetic operations.\n\nThis computing environment is used to launch a sandbox escape and gain code execution outside the IMTranscoderAgent\nsandbox. Google Project Zero published a separate write-up of the ForcedEntry sandbox escape [23]. Interestingly, the\nsandbox escape uses only logic bugs, avoiding the need for further memory corruption bugs, and bypassing certain\nmemory-corruption mitigations such as Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) and Memory Tagging.\n\nAfter escaping the sandbox, the ForcedEntry exploit downloaded a second-stage payload from a Pegasus infection server\nvia cloud fronting services, including Amazon’s CloudFront. We recovered Cache.db files from multiple devices targeted\nor compromised by ForcedEntry at the path /private/var/wireless/Library/Caches/com.apple.\ncoretelephony/Cache.db, which included the URL and headers of the HTTP GET request [17].\n\nExample Pegasus Installation URL loaded by ForcedEntry\n\nhttps://d38j2563clgblt.cloudfront[.]net/[uniqueid]//stadium/\nmegalodon?m=iPhone9,1&v=18C66\n\nPrior to iOS 14.7, ForcedEntry temporarily stored an encrypted ~250KB second-stage payload in the fsCachedData\nsubfolder under the com.apple.coretelephony cache directory. Forensic analysts cannot access this location of the\nphone unless the phone is jailbroken. This payload is encrypted with AES 128. The code launched by the .gif files\ndecrypts this second-stage payload via the AES128DecryptWithPassword method in OpusFoundation.framework using\n\n5 NSO Group may have tweaked ForcedEntry to avoid generating these cache files following the publication of the Pegasus Project.\n6 We saw no deployment of ForcedEntry between 2021-07-12 and 2021-07-19, which may be related to the lead-up to the publication of the\nPegasus Project on 2021-07-19. Thus, iOS 14.6 devices may not have been vulnerable in practice for these seven days, and a more conservative\nestimate for this value may be 43 days.\n\n|First observed deployment|January 2021|\n|---|---|\n|Last observed deployment|November 2021|\n|Total observed update deficit|131 days|\n|Earliest exploited version|iOS 14.4|\n|First Non-vulnerable version|iOS 14.8|\n|Specific test|Evidence of com.apple.coretelephony cache files containing Pegasus domain names (14.6 and prior).

The key appears to be randomized in each deployment of the exploit, meaning that\ndecrypting the payload requires both a copy of the .gif files and the item from the com.apple.coretelephony cache\ndirectory. The second-stage payload has not yet been publicly described or analysed.\n\nOnce the second stage was successfully decrypted and loaded, a subsequent Pegasus process was launched. In one instance,\nthis process was called gatekeeperd. On one phone, we identified a /private/var/root/Library/Caches/\ngatekeeperd/Cache.db file that records a single HTTP request to the same CloudFront domain. This URL request may\nrepresent a callback to the Pegasus installation server confirming that the installation had completed successfully.\n\nExample Pegasus URL loaded by ForcedEntry second stage\n\nhttps://d38j2563clgblt.cloudfront.net/[uniqueid]//stadium/wizard/01-00000000\n\nWe observed an early ForcedEntry variant on 15 January 2021 that appeared to involve a pivot-to-WebKit after ForcedEntry\nexploitation. The initial stages of the attack appear identical. After the sandbox escape, the com.apple.coretelephony\nprocess again downloaded the second-stage payload from the Pegasus installation server.\n\nThis second stage was launched with the process name ‘payload’ rather than a more innocuous-sounding name, as is\ntypical, suggesting the attack may still have been in development at the time. This payload stage subsequently launched a\nprocess called ‘bh’, that we previously observed only during instances of exploitation involving WebKit.\n\nWe did not observe a ‘bh’ process in any subsequent variants of the ForcedEntry attacks after January 2021. The presence\nof the ‘bh’ process indicates this attack used a pivot-to-WebKit step to complete the later stages of exploitation at this time.\nLater attacks show no evidence of ‘bh’, suggesting the pivot-to-WebKit stage was either replaced outright, or that NSO\nGroup decided to change the name.\n\n**SECTION 9: 2018-2019 ANDROID WHATSAPP EXPLOIT**\n\nIn April 2019 WhatsApp discovered and fixed a zero-click vulnerability (recorded as CVE-2019-3568) in WhatsApp for\n_Android video calling functionality, which was actively exploited by NSO Group Pegasus customers. WhatsApp also filed a_\nlawsuit against NSO Group for the targeting of its systems and customers. WhatsApp later notified more than 1,400 targets\nthat it says were targeted with the exploit between March and April 2019. However, through exploit archaeology, we\nbelieve we have uncovered a case of this zero-click exploit being used in July 2018, almost nine months before WhatsApp\nfixed the vulnerability.\n\nOn the phone of a dissident’s family member, we identified two crashes four minutes apart on a single day in July 2018.\nThe crashes were segfaults in the WhatsApp app. The former was a segfault in the main thread, and the latter was a segfault\nin the ‘VoIP Signaling’ thread.\n\nThe individual had previously been targeted with Pegasus one-click attacks against their Android device. Pegasus Project\ndata shows that the target’s number was selected for targeting three times on the day of the crashes, including one instance\nthat occurs 59 seconds before the first crash.\n\nWe additionally located an old copy of WhatsApp’s com.whatsapp_preferences.xml file on the phone, which we excerpt\nbelow. The file indicates that a video call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net ended two seconds after the first crash.\n\n<string name=\"previous_call_peer_id\">35796005384@s.whatsapp.net</string>\n<boolean name=\"previous_call_video_enabled\" value=\"true\" />\n<long name=\"previous_call_end_time\" value=\"[two seconds after first crash]\" />\n<string name=\"version\">2.18.203</string>\n\nIn the latter crash’s tombstone file, we found indications of the same (ASCII-encoded) identifier,\n35796005384@s.whatsapp.net, in registers D21 - D23 of the ‘Messages Async’ thread.\n\nWe additionally found a fragment of the call_log table from an old copy of msgstore.db stored on the phone that\nrecords six incoming calls from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net around the time of the crashes.\n\n_WhatsApp’s lawsuit against NSO mentions that attackers registered WhatsApp accounts used to send the malicious video_\ncalls using phone numbers bearing the country codes of at least six countries, including Cyprus [24]. WhatsApp’s lawsuit\nindicates that WhatsApp believes NSO Group conducted activities in relation to the attack as early as January 2018, though\n_WhatsApp’s notifications only covered a two-week period in March and April 2019._\n\nBecause the first crash we identify is tightly correlated with Pegasus Project data, because both crashes involve the same\nCypriot number, because WhatsApp mentioned Cyprus as one of the country codes used by the attack accounts, and\nbecause the crashes are otherwise consistent with CVE-2019-3568 (e.g. they occurred while processing video calls), we\n\n\n-----\n\nbelieve that the crashes are representative of July 2018 use of CVE-2019-3568 or a similar vulnerability against the target\nby an NSO Group customer.\n\n**Total time delta** **Event**\n\n+0s Selection in Pegasus Project data\n\n+45s Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table\n\n+46s Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table\n\n+59s Crash #1 (WhatsApp main thread)\n\n+61s previous_call_end_time for call for video call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net\n\n+287s Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table\n\n+288s Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table\n\n+308s Crash #2 (WhatsApp ‘VoIP Signaling’ thread) indicating 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net\nin registers of ‘Messages Async’ thread\n\n+355s Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table\n\n+413s Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table\n\n**SECTION 10: BROWSER EXPLOITS**\n\nThis paper has focused primarily on the zero-click exploit chains deployed by NSO Group for use by its customers. While\nzero-click vectors are highly prized, our forensic archaeology shows that NSO Group has also maintained an effective\none-click capability targeting all major versions of iOS since at least iOS 9.\n\nBrowser exploits for WebKit or Chrome can target a large, complex and ever-changing attack surface. The scripting\nenvironment available in web browsers can also ease the exploitation process when compared with (semi-)blind zero-click\nattack surfaces. As outlined in Section 1, browser exploits can also be used as pseudo zero-click vectors when delivered\nusing tactical network injection hardware (such as a malicious Wi-Fi network) or strategically from network injection\nequipment deployed upstream at an ISP.\n\nIn earlier sections we have also shown that browser exploits may be components of zero-click chains, where an initial\nzero-click attack surface is targeted before a pivot-to-WebKit to complete further exploitation and privilege escalation.\n\nIn most cases we do not have detailed information about the exploited vulnerabilities. Browser exploits interact with few\nservices on the device, making forensic investigation more difficult. NSO Group also implements a ‘clean-up’ step, which\ndeletes browser cache files and other artifacts that could reveal the attack vector [25].\n\nThe following table outlines the browser exploits we have observed from NSO Group in the wild. The targeted iOS version\ninformation is not exhaustive.\n\n|Total time delta|Event|\n|---|---|\n|+0s|Selection in Pegasus Project data|\n|+45s|Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table|\n|+46s|Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table|\n|+59s|Crash #1 (WhatsApp main thread)|\n|+61s|previous_call_end_time for call for video call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net|\n|+287s|Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table|\n|+288s|Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table|\n|+308s|Crash #2 (WhatsApp ‘VoIP Signaling’ thread) indicating 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net in registers of ‘Messages Async’ thread|\n|+355s|Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table|\n|+413s|Call from 35796005384@s.whatsapp.net per fragment of call_log table|\n\n|Time|Affected version|Artifacts|\n|---|---|---|\n|Before Aug 2016|Zero-day against iOS 9.3.3 (CVE-2016-4657)|WebKit vulnerability exploited as part of ‘Trident’ chain.

The duration\nand scale of zero-click targeting is longer and more extensive than previously documented in public sources.\n\nThis research shows that a single company, NSO Group, was able to maintain an operational zero-click capability against\nall major iOS versions from iOS 10 through iOS 14. We identified six distinct chains which enabled NSO Group customers\nto discreetly exploit targets extensively over years, at a global scale. The longevity of some zero-click chains likely reflects\nthe security community’s lack of visibility into mobile attacks.\n\nThere are few security solutions available to meaningfully analyse phones for traces for advanced targeted attacks [27].\nUsers often rely on their device manufacturers to find and patch exploit chains, but vendors may not be able to detect\non-device targeting due to limits in visibility and telemetry. While some one-click exploitation may be detectable by a\ncautious user, or with network monitoring systems, there is a lack of fine-grained telemetry and logging needed to detect or\nblock zero-click exploitation and other advanced attacks against mobile devices.\n\nThere are positive signs that defending against remote zero-click attacks may be more tractable than the wider field of\ncomputer security defence. Potential zero-click attack surfaces need to be remotely accessible, often must be exploited\nnon-interactively without a scripting environment, and ideally also be silent or at least non-alerting to the target.\n\nIn July 2019, Google Project Zero independently discovered an iMessage zero-click attack surface that appears to have\nbeen actively exploited by NSO Group customers at the time. The fact that multiple researchers may have identified the\nsame attack surface suggests the range of practically exploitable attack surfaces may be much smaller in the zero-click\ncontext. A systematic effort by device vendors and security researchers to enumerate, analyse and mitigate potential attacks\nagainst these attack surfaces has the potential to significantly reduce the scope of zero-click attacks.\n\nRecent security engineering efforts by Apple with its opt-in ‘Lockdown Mode’ also provide a model for further mitigations\n\n[28]. Lockdown Mode adds significant mitigations which may have disrupted some of the zero-click chains outlined in this\nresearch. Two of the attack chains targeted users with malicious attachments sent over iMessage. These attacks may have\nbeen disrupted by Lockdown Mode, which by default blocks incoming messages from any unknown contact. Photo album\nsharing is also disabled, which may have prevented the attack outlined in Section 6.\n\n_Apple has also significantly reduced the browser attack surface in Lockdown Mode. The Pegasus WebKit exploit for iOS 9_\nabused JIT optimizations to gain arbitrary code execution. This exploitation technique is no longer possible under\nLockdown Mode as JIT is disabled. Other vendors have explored similar mitigations, such as the opt-in Super Duper\nSecure Mode in Microsoft Edge [29].\n\nLockdown Mode is an important acknowledgement that not all users have the same threat model and security needs. Our\nresearch with civil society shows that some individuals and communities are persistently targeted with advanced\ncyber-surveillance systems and zero-day exploits from multiple vendors over many years.\n\nMajor technology vendors should follow Apple’s lead and provide solutions that are tailored to the unique threats faced by\ncivil society, including journalists and human rights activists because of who they are or the work that they do. These\nattacks can threaten the fundamental functioning of societies. The significant risks that these individuals face must not be\ndismissed as a rounding error in the security engineering efforts of major vendors.\n\nBrowser and operating system maintainers should provide opt-in enhanced mitigations and increased security telemetry to\nhelp at-risk individuals protect themselves from advanced targeted attacks. Technology companies can also play a crucial\nrole in informing users about the potential attacks they face.\n\nThe harms caused by the mercenary surveillance industry cannot be solved by technology alone. Targeted threat\nnotifications can enable victims to seek accountability and redress from surveillance companies and the governments that\nabuse these tools. Notifications should be as timely and descriptive as possible, to help users understand the threats they\nface and to find expert help to document and mitigate the attack.\n\nThe major technology vendors should continue to work closely with civil society researchers to help investigate and disrupt\nthese surveillance campaigns. All vendors, including non-mobile vendors, have visibility into various stages of the attacks\nfrom companies such as NSO Group. By working closely, we can shorten the lifetime of targeted attack campaigns and\nhelp protect global civil society communities.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] Marczak, B.; Scott-Railton, J.
