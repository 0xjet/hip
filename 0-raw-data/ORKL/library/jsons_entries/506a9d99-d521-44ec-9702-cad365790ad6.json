This tool, called\nVNCView, is described in a dedicated chapter.\n\n## A new update on the horizon\n\nAs of May 12, 2021, our monitoring systems started to\npick up an updated version of the vncDll module used\nby Trickbot against select high-profile targets. This\nmodule is known as tvncDll and is used for monitoring\nand intelligence gathering. It seems to be still under\ndevelopment, since the group has a frequent update\nschedule, regularly adding new functionalities and\nbug fixes.\n\nOur analysis focuses on identifying the\ncommunication protocol and the infrastructure behind\nit in correlation with the module’s new functionalities.\n\nDuring our investigation we also stumbled on an\nadditional tool used by the Trickbot group to facilitate\nthe access of other threat actors to the victims’\ncomputers.\n\n\n-----\n\nA Fresh Look at Trickbot’s Ever-Improving VNC Module\n\n### Communication Protocol\n\nThis module, vncDll / tvncDll, uses a custom communication protocol, which only makes it harder to understand\nwhat data is being transmitted without prior knowledge. The module communicates with the C2 servers defined in its\nconfiguration file called vncconfand which includes a list of up to nine IP addresses. These servers act as mediators\nbetween the victims and attackers, one of their roles being to enable access to victims behind firewalls.\n\nThe configuration file is sent to the module using the Control function, along with a command. In this case, there are\ntwo accepted commands, but only one is fully implemented. The commands are SetConf and Listen. While the latter\nis unimplemented, its existence suggests that the developers of the module were planning to implement a server\ncomponent for victims who aren’t behind firewalls. As its name implies, SetConf sets the configuration for the module,\nadding the IP addresses to the list of C2 servers. The module will use the first one it can connect to.\n\nThe port used to communicate with the servers is 443 to avoid arousing the suspicion of anyone observing the traffic.\nAlthough traffic on this port normally uses SSL or TLS, the data is sent unencrypted.\n\nThe communication protocol has two parts: the setup part and the normal operation mode.\n\n**Figure 1: Attack overview**\n\n##### Setup part\nThe role of the setup part is to announce the C2 server of its existence and receive a set of commands while waiting\nfor an attacker to connect to one of the servers and ask to be put in contact with one of the victims.\n\nThe setup part works as follows:\n\nThe client sends the marker “\\x03\\x02\\x01” followed by a structure containing the bot id that uniquely identifies\nthe victim and that is generated by Trickbot malware. It then waits for the server to reply with one of at least three\npossible commands, described as follows:\n\n###### 1. If the module receives TS5T, it will echo it back to the C2 server and wait for another command.\n This is used as a keep alive message while no attacker is requesting access to the victim. 2. If the module receives LliK, it will stop itself and ask Trickbot to unload it from memory. 3. If any other message is received, it will enter the normal operation mode, meaning that an attacker\n requested to communicate with the module and the C2 server is now just relaying messages between the two. It is also the moment when the module will create a new desktop that is fully controlled by the module and contains a custom interface.\n\n\n-----\n\nA Fresh Look at Trickbot’s Ever-Improving VNC Module\n\n##### Normal operation mode\nIn the normal operation mode, the messages are exchanged as follows:\n\nThe communication is full duplex, the victim can send screenshots of the alternative desktop and the clipboard data,\nthe server sends window messages that get decoded and processed.\n\nThe screenshot messages have the following format:\n\nMessage id (0x35354141 or “AA55”), followed by the size of the screenshot (4 bytes) and the X and Y coordinates of\nthe top left corner (2 bytes for each) and followed by the screenshot. The screenshot is taken in the bitmap (bmp)\nformat by the malware, but for network transportation it is converted to either jpeg or png, depending on its size.\nIf the image is under 40000 pixels it will be sent as png. Notably, the malware isn’t sending full screenshots at a\nregular interval, but is instead sending a full screenshot at first, then it’s sending only screenshots of the parts of the\nalternative desktop that changed, hence the use of the X and Y coordinates.\n\n**Figure 2: First 16 bytes of a screenshot message**\n\nThe clipboard messages have the following format:\n\nThe size of the clipboard plus one encoded as a WORD, followed by the marker “\\x44\\xBB” and the clipboard\nencoded as wide characters truncated to a maximum of 512 (so, a max of 1024 1 byte characters).\n\n**Figure 3: Example clipboard message where the clipboard would contain only “A”**\n\nOne more thing to mention is that the module always sends 1024 bytes after the header, leading to out of bounds\nmemory reads and the leaking of memory contents from the victim’s computer.\n\nThere is one other message that can be sent (0xBB440001), that shows the module wasn’t able to create the\nalternative desktop, after which it closes the connection.\n\nThe server sends its commands as follows:\n\nlParam (4 bytes), 4 unused / padding bytes, wParam (4 bytes), another 4 unused / padding bytes and then the\nmessage (4 bytes) and is decoded in the following way.\n\n\n-----\n\nA Fresh Look at Trickbot’s Ever-Improving VNC Module\n\n**Figure 4:The decompiled code that does the decoding of the message**\n\n**Figure 5:Message format**\n\nThe window messages are processed as expected, simulating mouse clicks or key presses on the virtual desktop that\nwas created. Besides the usual messages, the module processes a few control messages, probably coming from the\nattacker’s interface, such as forcing the module to resend a screenshot, or gracefully exiting the session.\n\nUsing this knowledge, a client can be implemented to test its functionality.\n\nDuring normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons\nfrom the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right click menu,\ncontaining custom functionality.\n\n**Figure 6: The menu that appears if a right click command is sent.**\n\nMost of the options just open programs from the machine, but through Cmd.exe the threat actors can perform\nseveral high-impact actions leveraging PowerShell, such as:\n\n###### - download new payloads to further propagate the attack inside the network;\n - open different documents or the email inbox;\n - upload data from victims’ computers to the command-and-control servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nA Fresh Look at Trickbot’s Ever-Improving VNC Module\n\nweekly updates.\n\n**Figure 7: The window that appears if a left click on the “Native Browser” button is sent**\n\nBy default, it creates its own browser using the OLE automation feature for Internet Explorer.\n\n**Figure 8: Working browser window created using OLE automation**\n\nThe buttons on the left of the navigation bar are supposed to be used for password dumping, and should work for\nChrome, Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer, but this functionality properly works for Internet Explorer only.\n\n\n-----\n\nA Fresh Look at Trickbot’s Ever-Improving VNC Module\n\n**Figure 9: The password dumping panel triggered by selecting IE and Pw in the native browser panel**\n\nIn the last update that we know for this module, the password dumping for Firefox was in the works, but for now, it\ndoesn’t seem to function as expected.\n\n**Figure 10: Output from the module**\n\nThe vncDll module was used by the Trickbot threat actors since 2018 (based on the compiled time for the files found\nin our malware collection), but the new updated version was released in the wild on May 11[th ]2021 (based on the\nsame background research).\n\n### The viewer tool\n\nWhile searching for older versions of the module, we stumbled upon a very old one\n(e2916d8061258fc1c52739209b192406), with the compile time of 2019-04-29 08:19:47, referencing a PDB with a very\nunusual path:\n\n**Figure 11: PDB path of the module**\n\nThis led us to find another file (3bd25b1989db5802d0cf68ae3d532e87) with a similar path.\n\n**Figure 12: PDB path of the viewer tool**\n\nThis second file (that we will further call “the viewer”) is the client the attackers use to interact with the victims\nthrough the C2 servers. This gave us a “behind the scenes” look at how Trickbot operators are facilitating access on\nthe victims’ computers to their clients and on how their tools for interactions with the victims are working.\n\nThe viewer seems to be using a hardcoded IP address to communicate with the victims (even if the interface\nindicates otherwise, the connection function rewrites the user input). This server is behaving similarly to the other C2\n\n\n-----\n\nA Fresh Look at Trickbot’s Ever-Improving VNC Module\n\nservers, the setup part of the protocol being used to either retrieve the list of victims and their state, or to initiate the\nforwarding of messages between the clients and the victims.\n\nThe viewer can obtain the bot id of a victim either by asking the hardcoded server for a list of victims, or by user\ninteraction, through the interface or by accessing a webserver handled by the viewer at http://127.0.0.1:80/vncstart.\n\nWhen the viewer needs to obtain the list of victims, it sends the marker “\\x01\\x02\\x03” to the baked in server, and the\nserver responds with an array of structures detailing the bot id and the state of the bot. This array is parsed, displayed\nin a list of bots and stored locally in a file called vnclist located in the same directory as the viewer itself.\n\nThe structure for one entry in the array looks as follows:\n\n**Figure 13: Bot information structure**\n\nThe status field is one of the following possible values:\n\n**Value of the status field** **Status description (taken literal** **Description**\n**from the code itself)**\n\n0 ??? - unknown No information is currently available\n\n1 offline The victim is offline\n\n2 busy Someone is already connected to the victim\n\n3 blocked Victim is somehow banned\n\n10 online The victim is online and ready to be interacted with\n\n**Table 1: Status fields**\n\nThe most common values for the status field are 1, 2 and 10 (offline, busy and online), the value of 0 is set when the\nuser enters a bot id.\n\nIf we connect to the server and ask for the list of victims, we can observe something odd: some values for the bot id\nfield don’t have the format of a bot id.\n\n**Figure 14: Hex view of a response from then server when asking for a list of victims**\n\nA bunch of entries in the list start with “TEMP:CP-” followed by an UUID. This could be a developer of the module\ntesting it using a custom module loader tool.\n\nThe bot id is then used to communicate with that victim. This is done by sending the marker “\\x05\\x01\\x00”\n(technically it would be “\\x05\\x01\\x00\\x01”, but the send function is specified to only send 3 bytes) and the bot id.\n\nAt this point, if the victim is online and no one else is connected to the server, the attacker will send a marker to the\nvictim to start the screen sharing process and it will now only be used to forward packets between the client and the\nvictim\n\n\n-----\n\nA Fresh Look at Trickbot’s Ever-Improving VNC Module\n\nA statistic that we were able to extract during our investigation shows that the interval that a victim was in the online\nstate (waiting for an attacker to connect) was between 14 and 46 minutes and the interval an attacker was connected\nto a victim to send commands was from 1 minute to 29 minutes. More details are illustrated in table below:\n\n**DAY** **BOTS ONLINE** **AVG NUMBER OF** **AVG NUMBER OF**\n**MINUTES SPENT ONLINE** **MINUTES SPENT BUSY**\n```\n5/21/2021 7A7BB7EE73B39FB5D0907FCF691552BB 14\n\n```\n`5/24/2021` `8179540F734B51B0ABB3C6B9F7DBB7D6` `37.33333333` 29.5\n```\n        B6582EEF39568179253764078FF7B37D\n        BBAB9DBFD53B1DDFDFBC33B4D25F414B\n        FFDF73B813BB48B95399B7F4C33750CB\n        B17675C6F3FBF8595482BB6B71B7643F\n        BB33B3BB33BB3B3B3BBCE7D734465B89\n\n```\n`5/25/2021` `B6582EEF39568179253764078FF7B37D` `30` 9.666666667\n```\n        02099117A64BB6D09D5952EB37FF7AA5\n        BB3251DD6DBFF9397B94CBB9D1395ACB\n        B17675C6F3FBF8595482BB6B71B7643F\n        5A8B3667BB3083FF87FBB395B37563B3\n        BB33B3BB33BB3B3B3BBCE7D734465B89\n        338F5B8B3B38BBDB25F773DDF7DCBBAF\n        EF33B5DF15385B799C171D2BB9E50F3B\n\n```\n`5/27/2021` `BB7137A177FC5F951D3383B19CF7B721` `32` 4\n```\n        F13F468DBDC8BBABFB711ABFBF91DF62\n        BE0A9BF57B3BA407170633BB99750CD3\n5/28/2021 30\n        320B9DD0233B13F7F99F7FE0BF5B3FBB\n        BBC773FB7437B96B359BB3B3067D933B\n        BB342F9D6D2FFB4C991A44BBA56199E2\n6/5/2021 4BB94B32E237B383F5458B3E71F3D3D3 30\n\n```\n`6/7/2021` `31EE4BB68D3591F73CD3BB9E15B9B2EB` `46.33333333` 9.5\n```\n        338F5B8B3B38BBDB25F773DDF7DCBBAF\n        EF33B5DF15385B799C171D2BB9E50F3B\n\n```\n`6/9/2021` `3FFB81F3AFFBBCF55F7683FB9D557DC2` `40` 1\n`6/15/2021` `0CDBB4A9F9141337AA9FF4403B3A9511` `45.42857143` 4\n```\n        7B17B3FF33D9F7B540BB093151A2E7B3\n        BB3251DD6DBFF9397B94CBB9D1395ACB\n        5BB3BC0BBF93F31F1B77EE9DF39334EA\n        9D7FBF76155241DB8915D97715531DBB\n        1FF2D737B737D16233BA7857250BB773\n        77B1BBAA31525073F1AFF9C3B3313FDF\n\n```\n**Table 2: Online/Busy sessions**\n\nWe also found more viewers, most of whom have little to no change to their functionality.
