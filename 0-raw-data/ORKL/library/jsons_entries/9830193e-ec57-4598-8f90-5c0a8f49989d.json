If the attacker successfully hoodwinks the\ntarget into extracting the phony document, executing either file triggers the malicious\npackage and compromises the system, Trustwave researcher Diana Lopera wrote in the\npost.\n\nThe CHM file used in the attack is mostly a copy of a legitimate CHM, but has appended\nHTML application code – that extra code silently runs the malicious executable in the\nbackground when the CHM file is run.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe particular flavor of Vidar used in the attack, Lopera noted, is version 50.3, and receives\nits command-and-control (C&C) instructions from accounts on open-source social networking\nplatform Mastodon. Once up and running, the malware downloads configuration information\nfrom C&C servers identified by the Mastodon page and starts its work – first collecting\nsystem information and password data from browsers and other applications, sending that\ninformation as a ZIP file back to the C&C server, and then deleting itself, potentially after\npulling additional malware onto the infected machine.\n\n“Appending a malicious file to an unsuspecting file format is one of the tricks our adversaries\nuse to evade detection,” wrote Lopera.\n\n## What is Vidar?\n\nVidar was first observed in the wild in late 2018, according to a report from cloud security\nvendor Infoblox, which noted that it’s a variant of the earlier Arkei infostealer. It’s sold\ncommercially in online forums, and has the ability to steal a wide variety of user information\nand valuable data from infected computers, including credit card numbers, usernames and\npasswords, desktop screenshots, and cryptocurrency wallets. It can even bypass some\ntypes of two-factor authentication, particularly targeting the Authy 2FA stack.\n\nAs ever, strong email security practices can mitigate or eliminate the risks posed by Vidar –\nextreme caution should be used when opening email attachments from unfamiliar senders\nwith generic subject lines, and verification either over the phone or in person should be the\nfirst move if there is any doubt about such a message’s legitimacy.\n\n\n-----",
