This\nfamily of botnets, which consists of BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2, was described in a\n[Radware Attack Report (‘BrickerBot’ Results In PDoS Attack).](https://security.radware.com/ddos-threats-attacks/brickerbot-pdos-permanent-denial-of-service/)\n\nICS-CERT is working to identify vendors of affected IoT devices in order to collect productspecific mitigations and compensating controls. ICS-CERT is issuing this alert to provide\nearly notice of the report and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and\nother cybersecurity attacks.\n\n## DETAILS\n\n**--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 --------**\n\nAccording to Radware, this bot attack is designed to render a connected device useless by\ncausing a PDoS, or “bricked” state. BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2 exploit hard-coded\npasswords, exposed SSH, and brute force Telnet. According to Radware’s Attack Report and\nopen source reporting, the following details regarding BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2 are\navailable:\n\n\n-----\n\nBrickerBot.1 targets devices running BusyBox with an exposed Telnet command\nwindow. These devices also have SSH exposed through an older version of Dropbear\nSSH server. Most of these devices were also identified as Ubquiti network devices\nrunning outdated firmware. Some of these devices are access points or bridges with\nbeam directivity. BrickerBot.1 was active from March 20, 2017 to March 25, 2017.\nAccording to Radware, BrickerBot.1 attacks have ceased.\nBrickerBot.2 targets Linux-based devices which may or may not run BusyBox and\nwhich expose a Telnet service protected by default or hard-coded passwords. The\nsource of the attacks is concealed by TOR exit nodes.\nNo information is available at this time about the type and number of devices used in\nperforming these attacks.\n\n**--------- End Update A Part 1 of 2----------**\n\nThis situation is still developing. ICS-CERT is working to identify vendors of affected devices\nin order to collect more detailed mitigation information.\n\n## MITIGATION\n\nICS-CERT is currently working to identify vendors of affected IoT devices in order to collect\nmore detailed mitigation information. Radware recommended taking the following\nprecautions in the Attack Report above:\n\nChange the device’s factory default credentials.\nDisable Telnet access to the device.\nUse network behavioral analysis to detect anomalies in traffic and combine with\nautomatic signature generation for protection.\nSet intrusion protection systems to block Telnet default credentials or reset telnet\nconnections. Use a signature to detect the provided command sequences.\n\n**--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------**\n\nUpdate your Ubiquiti Networks devices with the latest firmware.\n\n**--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2----------**\n\nAny positive or suspected findings should be immediately reported to ICS-CERT for further\nanalysis and correlation.\n\nICS-CERT strongly encourages asset owners not to assume that their control systems are\ndeployed securely or that they are not operating with an Internet accessible configuration.\nInstead, asset owners should thoroughly audit their networks for Internet facing devices,\nweak authentication methods, and component vulnerabilities. Control systems often have\nInternet accessible devices installed without the owner’s knowledge, putting those systems\nat increased risk of attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nICS-CERT recommends, as quality assurance, that users test the mitigations in a test\ndevelopment environment that reflects their production environment prior to installation. In\naddition, users should:\n\nMinimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices\nshould not directly face the Internet.\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the\nbusiness network.\nIf remote access is required, employ secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks\n(VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.\nRemove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible.\nApply patches in the ICS environment, when possible to mitigate known vulnerabilities.\nImplement policies requiring the use of strong passwords.\nMonitor the creation of administrator level accounts by third-party vendors.\n\nICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment\nprior to taking defensive measures.\n\n[ICS-CERT also provides a control systems recommended practices page on the](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/ics/content/recommended-practices) ICS-CERT\nweb site. Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including\n[Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)\n\nOrganizations that observe any suspected malicious activity should follow their established\ninternal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against\nother incidents.\n\n## Contact Information\n\nFor any questions related to this report, please contact the CISA at:\n\nEmail: [CISAservicedesk@cisa.dhs.gov](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:cisaservicedesk@cisa.dhs.gov)\n\nToll Free: 1-888-282-0870\n[For industrial control systems cybersecurity information: https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/ics)\n\n[or incident reporting: https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/report)\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
