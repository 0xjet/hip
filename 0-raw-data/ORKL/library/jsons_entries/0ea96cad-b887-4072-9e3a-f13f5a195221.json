The malware itself is\neither a fork, or evolution of, the “Arkei” malware variant. Moreover, Vidar malware can be obtained as a\n“Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)” offering, meaning that the threat group can lease out the same infrastructure to\nmultiple, less established, threat actors for a variety of purposes. In the case that we examined, aside from the\ninitial data theft, the malware strain was also detected to have been utilised to infect the victim with coin\nminers, crypto hijackers, and additional infostealer strains.\n\n  - The malware performed data exfiltration on any available data within the affected user's profile prior to\ninstalling further command & control (C2) persistence mechanisms and subsequently interacting with a\nmalicious IP address for further instruction.\n\n  - The malicious payload was contained within a seemingly legitimate software executable and was presented to\nthe user via a search engine advertisement masquerading as a legitimate resource. This was sufficient to trick\nthe user into downloading and executing it. In this instance, the advertisement offered a free version of the\nAdobe Illustrator application, while the software executable itself was originally a Yahtzee scoreboard.\n\n  - The malware was detected as having connected to two legitimate services, namely, Telegram and Steam, to\nascertain C2 information. The malware then communicated with an attacker-controlled server to receive\ninstructions, upload stolen data, and obtain further malicious payloads. Following successful execution of the\ninfostealer, an XMRIG cryptocurrency miner was installed.\n\n  - A malware strain with stealer functionality, known as ‘Bebra’, was also detected.\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn recent months, there has been a significant increase in the reported instances in the detection of malicious advertising\ncampaigns, promoting fake software websites with the aim of deceiving target users into downloading malware\ncomponents.\n\nVidar provides threat actors with the option to standardise preferences with regards to the data stolen by its\nimplementation. Additionally, the malware utilises social media platforms to facilitate remote C2 functionality over\nWindows-based operating systems.\n\nThe sample investigated within this report was delivered via a malicious link which pointed to a fake software download\npage for Adobe Illustrator. This site, hosted on Digital Ocean, led to the user downloading a password protected archive\nfile, “FullMainFile_Use_2023_As_PassWrd.rar”, containing a 457 MB executable “Setup.exe” which appears to have been\nmade from a legitimate Yahtzee scoreboard application.\n\nThe customisation of the package prevents signature-based detection, while the password protection prevents antivirus\nproducts from inspecting the contents of the downloaded file before it is executed.\n\nThis report documents the analysis of an instance of the Vidar malware, which was identified through our Security\nOperations Centre (SOC), and the successive investigation of the post-exploitation techniques.\n\n\nTLP Status: White Privileged & Confidential Page 5 of 39\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware History\n\nThe Vidar malware strain is classified as a Trojan of the information stealer variety[1]. The malware was first identified in\n2018[2] as a variant of the Arkei malware family[3]. It is a product that provides threat actors with the option to standardise\npreferences with regards to the data stolen by its implementation. Additionally, the malware provides remote C2\nfunctionality within the context of the Windows operating systems, through the utilisation of social media platforms. To\nthat extent, the IP address associated with the C2 infrastructure has been detected to be embedded within the profile of\na user on such platforms. As a result of this configuration, the malware can subsequently access the related profile,\ninteract with the associated IP address, and download a variety of files and additional malware components.\n\nAt the time of writing, the most recent peer-reviewed literature indicates that the Vidar malware is mainly distributed via\nan exploit kit associated with the Fallout gaming franchise. Moreover, this exploit kit can be purchased online, at a cost of\nUS$700 for the professional version[4], although a base-line version can be purchased for $250 [5]. The malware is typically\ndeployed via email communication channels, most commonly as an ISO file, which will be embedded within illicit installer\nprogrammes for otherwise legitimate software programmes, such as Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Teams[6]. Upon\nsuccessful delivery, the malware possesses the capabilities of engaging in defence evasion techniques, which involves\neither the application of significantly large executable files or files that are digitally signed, with an expired digital\ncertificate.\n\nBased on its design as an infostealer, the ultimate objective, within the context of deploying the Vidar malware strain, is\nto obtain sensitive data from an infected system, browsers, or digital wallets, and then exfiltrate this data to the\nassociated threat actor. Cybercriminals possess the freedom to choose the type of data that they wish to obtain, via the\nutilisation of the Vidar malware, due to the plethora of internal options contained within the malware exploit kit. Some\nexamples of such sensitive data-based entities include:\n\n  - Operating System Data\n\n  - Account Credentials\n\n  - Credit Card Data\n\n  - Browser History.\n\nVidar malware records all of the stolen data into a text file, compresses it to an archive file in the ‘.zip’ format and then\nsends it to a C2 server.\n\nIn conjunction with the ability to collect these data components, the Vidar malware can also be employed as a\ndownloader for additional malware strains. The C2 centre complex will, in such cases, specify a malicious link containing\nthe desired malware download packet and will, in due course, execute said malware.\n\nTrojans, such as Vidar, will remain undetected within the target landscape, and as such, they possess the ability to\nexecute covertly, without their presence being known. In the case of the Vidar malware, it has been reported to have\nbeen successfully identified as running within the confines of the Task Manager as the “Delighters Simulations Retriever”\nprocess[7].\n\n1 [https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/spyware-vidar](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/spyware-vidar)\n2

The sample we observed within this\ncampaign was delivered through a malicious link, pointing to a fake software download page for Adobe Illustrator. This\nsite, hosted on Digital Ocean, led to the user downloading a password protected archive file,\n“FullMainFile_Use_2023_As_PassWrd.rar”, containing a 457 MB executable “Setup.exe” which appears to have been\nmade from a legitimate Yahtzee scoreboard application. The password protection would hinder automatic security tools\nfrom detecting the malicious component as could the inflated size of the file, since there are often size limits on what can\nbe scanned. Embedded within this .exe was an AES encrypted sample of Vidar, which is decrypted at run time and\ninjected into a legitimate Windows process. The unencrypted sample, internally labelled moabLuck2.exe, was obfuscated\nto frustrate analysis attempts using the KoiVM[8] plugin for ConfuserEx, an open-source anti-debugging tool.\n\nOnce executed, the moabLuck2.exe binary checks a Telegram account or a public Steam profile (used as dead drop\nresolver) to locate the current C2 server. It connects to the C2 over HTTP to receive configuration instructions telling it\nwhat types of information to steal, as well as an archive (samefiles.zip) containing legitimate .dlls. These are used during\ndata collection to help retrieve information from different applications including browser data. This is all collated along\nwith hardware information and files from the victim’s user profile. After exfiltrating sensitive data to the C2, the server\npasses the malware a list of URLs from which to download further binaries to execute.\n\nObserved payloads include Mina.exe, an XMRIG miner; Clip1.exe, a Laplas Clipper sample; and bebra.exe, a previously\nunknown malware strain with stealer functionality. Some samples were packed with Themida[9] and others with\nVMProtect[10], both commercial packers with advanced anti-debugging features.\n\n8 [https://github.com/Loksie/KoiVM-Virtualization](https://github.com/Loksie/KoiVM-Virtualization)\n9 [https://www.oreans.com/Themida.php](https://www.oreans.com/Themida.php)\n10 [https://vmpsoft.com/](https://vmpsoft.com/)\n\n\nTLP Status: White Privileged & Confidential Page 12 of 39\n\n\n-----\n\n### High-Level Overview\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the actions undertaken on a device, following the download of the Vidar executable:\n\n_Figure 1: Vidar steps undertaken after initial execution_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Setup.exe\n\n#### METADATA\n\nFile name FullMainFile_Use_2023_As_PassWrd.rar\n\nDescription Password protected RAR file utilised as the malicious executable delivery\nmechanism\n\nSize 2,138,204 bytes\n\nMD5 a9e7fd1d332d4481367b35e1be6fa4ba\n\nSHA-1 8eab3fbc92f7067512c35d0884dd3b9e28941cf7\n\nSHA-256 e433512ad2b47afbc778ab161a218944b504c90f513ff320d2aa8bfc55d5cb25\n\nFile name Setup.exe\n\nOriginal File Name iHciaG.exe\n\nDescription 64-bit malicious executable used for installation of the Vidar stealerware\n\nSize 479,221,504 bytes\n\nMD5 82121649ff44e92e9b029fcdf0e25cce\n\nSHA-1 4b69c4e931e15655d050e8683663982fd1195f9d\n\nSHA-256 6afd1ceacb145d84e706c553247459bbd492733e50f21de8a42424ba7de87c62\n\nCompile Time 16:04 2023-01-03\n\n#### ANALYSIS\n\nThe initial dropper witnessed within this strain of Vidar drops a password protected .rar file to avoid detection from antimalware solutions. Once unpacked the directory contains an executable file, setup.exe, and a directory entitled “langs”.\nSetup.exe is an unsigned executable which presents as being a “Yahtzee Scorboard”, detailed within figure 2.\n\n_Figure 2: Digital signature output_\n\n|File name|FullMainFile_Use_2023_As_PassWrd.rar|\n|---|---|\n|Description|Password protected RAR file utilised as the malicious executable delivery mechanism|\n|Size|2,138,204 bytes|\n|MD5|a9e7fd1d332d4481367b35e1be6fa4ba|\n|SHA-1|8eab3fbc92f7067512c35d0884dd3b9e28941cf7|\n|SHA-256|e433512ad2b47afbc778ab161a218944b504c90f513ff320d2aa8bfc55d5cb25|\n\n|File name|Setup.exe|\n|---|---|\n|Original File Name|iHciaG.exe|\n|Description|64-bit malicious executable used for installation of the Vidar stealerware|\n|Size|479,221,504 bytes|\n|MD5|82121649ff44e92e9b029fcdf0e25cce|\n|SHA-1|4b69c4e931e15655d050e8683663982fd1195f9d|\n|SHA-256|6afd1ceacb145d84e706c553247459bbd492733e50f21de8a42424ba7de87c62|\n|Compile Time|16:04 2023-01-03|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe executable itself has also been marked on VirusTotal[11] as malicious by various anti-malware solutions.\n\nA review of the decompiled executable uncovered two functions of particular interest: ‘moab3e’ and ‘moabEve5’.\n‘Moab3e’ acts as the encryption key for an encoded executable file within the ‘moabEve5’ function.

The key functionality of this\nmalware strain is to steal data from the clipboards of infected users. The Laplas Clipper strain typically targets\ncryptocurrency users in order to redirect payments to the threat actors’ wallets. However, in this instance it was noted as\nacting and behaving as a stealer which is subsequently sent to the threat actor.\n\nA scheduled task is created for persistence purposes – this is achieved through the command line presented within\nfigures 16 and 17.\n\n_Figure 15: Scheduled task creation_\n\n|File name|Clip1.exe|\n|---|---|\n|Description|32-bit malicious executable used for C2 communication|\n|Size|3,979,776 bytes|\n|MD5|076ff7b77b0f86ba643a581727420e7a|\n|SHA-1|d59cf71fd91645b00f868d4f913c18675a58156e|\n|SHA-256|8e6e3db76d44df50f82628eaaaf96fd9ef4dad484bc954ad0388fc6b6a66da43|\n|Compile Time|2023-01-06 01:08:32 UTC|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16: Clipper persistence mechanism_\n\nOnce the executable has configured the persistence mechanisms, it spawns a connection to an XMRIG mining pool.

Once on a profile page, the malware parses the returned response in order to retrieve the\nnext IP address location for further C2 instructions.\n\nFigure 19 has been provided to evidence the communication received back to Vidar from the C2 server. This response\nfrom the server details to Vidar the enumeration and data to provide back to the threat actor’s C2 environment.\n\n_Figure 19: Screenshot showing a network capture of the configuration being downloaded by the malware_\n\nThe instructions received by the C2 server back to the Vidar executable are in keeping with historically seen infections.\nThis aspect of the campaign hasn’t seen significant change since its inception. Figure 20 has been provided to evidence\nsome of the data sent by the Vidar malware back to the C2 servers, however, full system enumeration and the export of\nany stored credentials found within browsers has also been noted as being exfiltrated.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20: Some of the captured data sent to the C2_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Clipper Command and Control\n\nLaplas Clipper was seen communicating with the domain clipper[.]guru.
