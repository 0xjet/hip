However, there’s been little information about some of the connections that\nSUNBURST has shared ‘in public’ and the stories of the affected organisations, while there\nhave also been some stories that tried to grasp these connections, but ended up in providing\nthe opposite effect; a false sense of security.\n\nA quick summary for those who’ve not been aware of this recent hack yet; On December 13,\n[2020, FireEye put out a post sharing that they “discovered a supply chain attack trojanizing](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\nSolarWinds Orion business software updates in order to distribute malware”. After some\nresearch, it turned out that up to 18.000 SolarWinds customers could’ve potentially received\nthe trojanized updates for the Orion software. These customers should be considered\n‘victims’ of the attack. Only ‘high value’ organisations of interest to the attackers received\nadditional malicious software intended for further exploitation. These customers should be\nconsidered ‘targets’ of the attack.\n\n## Decrypting SUNBURST domains\n\nThere have been plenty of posts and tools on how to decrypt SUNBURST domains so I’ll try\nto keep this as short as possible:\n\nIn general, the SUNBURST backdoor collects several kinds of information about the infected\nsystem, encrypts this information into a combination of strings, adds these together, and\nsends this information back to the attackers through the use of DNS requests for\nsubdomains of the avsvmcloud[.]com domain. To be specific, the subdomains are always\nsimilar to the following patterns:\n\n\n-----\n\n[subdomain].appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com\n\n[subdomain].appsync-api.us-west-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com\n\n[subdomain].appsync-api.us-east-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com\n\n[subdomain].appsync-api.us-east-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com\n\nEven though there are four possible options for the first-subdomain, being eu-west-1/uswest-2/us-east-1/us-east-2, these do not seem to relate to any specific geographical\ntargeting, nor does changing these domains change anything on the encoded data that’s\nbeen submitted in the third-subdomain. Their only intention so far seems to be to mimic\nservices like AmazonAWS to give the made connections some form of legitimacy.\nOccasionally I’ve seen several variations on these four first-subdomains like cn-west-1, euwest-2, and us-west-1 yet there is no indication that these subdomains have been in use by\nthe backdoor itself.\n\nAs for the third-subdomain, this is where the transferred data comes into play. I don’t want to\nget too much into the actual encryption/decryption as others like RedDrip Team from QiAnXin\nTechnology, [Prevasio,](https://blog.prevasio.com/2020/12/sunburst-backdoor-part-ii-dga-list-of.html) [Cloudflare and](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-quirk-in-the-sunburst-dga-algorithm/) [NETRESEC have already written detailed reports on](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2020-12&post=Reassembling-Victim-Domain-Fragments-from-SUNBURST-DNS)\nthis. In summary, these subdomains consist of the following parts: an encoded GUID, a byte\nthat functions as the XORkey for the GUID and the hostname of the local network of the\ninfected system or other additional information like encoded timestamps or active Antivirusproducts or the [confirmation to become a target instead of a victim. These are the important](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2021-01&post=Finding-Targeted-SUNBURST-Victims-with-pDNS)\nbits that supply both the attackers as well as the community important information about the\ninfected systems.\n\n## Passive DNS and the post-December noise\n\nAs mentioned above, the SUNBURST backdoor reports back to the avsmcloud[.]com domain\nwith the collected data in the shape of DNS requests for a specific subdomain. So collecting\nas much as these requests as possible is important as in a lot of cases the collected data is\ntransferred from the backdoor to the attackers in several batches (e.g. local hostnames and\ntimestamps are never sent together, nor do long hostnames get sent in one request but are\nfragmented in multiple queries based on their length as the subdomains are limited to a max\nlength of 32 characters). There are many ways to get passive DNS on avsmcloud[.]com,\nthere are several pastebins with lists of passive DNS and there are several parties like\n[RiskIQ,](https://www.riskiq.com/products/passivetotal/) [FarSight DNSDB,](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/solutions/dnsdb/) [VirusTotal, and others that have big lists of records for the domain.](https://www.virustotal.com/)\nHowever, after the first reports came out about the hack, the passive DNS results for\navsmcloud[.]com subdomains have kind of gotten out of hand as the domain accepted any\nrequest due to the lack of knowing what kind of systems were running the Solarwinds\nsoftware and malicious updates, both before and after the Microsoft takeover. Combined with\n\n\n-----\n\nthe messy nature of passive DNS on its own, it turned out into a bit of a mess… And that s\nan understatement with close to 200k recorded subdomains.. and probably way more as this\nis only based on my findings…\n\na small portion of passive DNS data on avsmcloud[.]com\nFortunately, there are a few clues that helping sorting through this noise:\n\nFirst of all, we know the backdoor communicates in the mentioned patterns as mentioned\nabove so that sorts out a big part of the noise (set the odd cn-west-1, etc. subdomains aside\nfor a bit, as their third-subdomains could still contain actual information). Second, we know\nthe GUID and XORkey make up 16 characters and the backdoor has a 32 character limit, so\nthe third-subdomain should be between 17 and 32 characters long. Furthermore, you can\ndiscard any subdomains that contain any symbols in the third-subdomain.\n\n## The SUNBURST Puzzles\n\nNow that you’ve got a decent bunch of DNS requests, you can start decoding the\n[subdomains with tools such as the ones provided by RedDrip,](https://github.com/RedDrip7/SunBurst_DGA_Decode) [FireEye, or](https://github.com/2igosha/sunburst_dga) [NETRESEC. Their](https://www.netresec.com/files/SunburstDomainDecoder.zip)\ntools will do a lot of work for you, and sometimes even do all the work, depending on the\namount of data you supply to the tools. The GUID’s come into play to help with connecting\nthe separate queries, as that specific GUID stays unique to the infected system regardless of\nthe XOR’ing of the GUID. This way you’re also able to match encoded timestamps to\nhostnames and the other way around. The XORkey, however, is also an indicator for longer\nsplit domains on which part is based on the decoded value of the byte, ranging from 0 to 35.\nThe first part of the payload will have a byte value of 0 if the domain is long enough to\nrequire multiple requests. The last part of the payload will always have a byte value of 35.\nInfected systems with short domain names will have only one request with a byte value of\n35. This is kinda tricky as it’s not always clear whether a domain is the last part of a\nfragmented domain, or just very short.\n\nMost of this will work out just fine, however, sometimes you will find yourself ending up\nmissing a piece or two for a full domain. In the case of only lowercase alphanumeric\ndomains, this ain’t too much of a problem as you will often be able to find the remaining bit\nby using the same passive DNS to look for similar domains with additional characters, or you\n\n\n-----\n\ncan find them while simply googling for the bit you have. Do however keep some caution\nwhile doing this, as not every first result will be the one you’re looking for. E.g.\nuo8igvgkvslrh9b9e6vi0edsovertr2s[.]appsync-api[.]us-east-1[.]avsvmcloud.com decodes to\n‘csnt.princegeor’. When searching for princegeorge one of the first results ends up as\nprincegeorge[.]ca, which seems plausible, however, with some proper research you will be\nable to find that princegeorge[.]com, even though seemingly unimportant at first sight, has\nhad an actual subdomain involving ‘csnt’. If you look at who owns princegeorge[.]com, it’s\nfairly obvious which of the two is way more likely to use Solarwinds software.\n\nAnother bit that the tools seem to have problems with, are the domains that contain\ncharacters beyond lower alphanumeric characters and “.-_”. As the SUNBURST backdoor\nuses a different method of encryption for these domains (base32 encoding with a custom\nalphabet). There are a few options, often consisting of missing pieces or misplaced\nsingle/double 0’s when joining parts. When you do know the order of the pieces is correct\nbased on the byte values, check for any potential overlapping/connecting 0’s. Often that\nsolves the issue. As for the missing pieces, you can be a bit cheeky with those.\n\nExample of tweaking for GUID ‘5EC540468DC722FF’\nSometimes manually joining the parts allows the tool to better understand the given input. If\nthis fails, I prefer to just add a ‘donor’ piece. As we know the backdoor limits it’s pieces to 32\ncharacters max, we know that when we miss the first part out of four parts, that the first part\nhas to be 16 characters starting with 00. Add in the donor and you will get a view of what the\nother pieces are. Sure, you don’t have the full domain at this point, but knowing what 3/4\npieces make up for is way more information than having none. It also gives you additional\noptions to find the potential missing part with more passive DNS/OSINT work. You could\neven bruteforce the connecting bit of the missing first and second piece by comparing the\nresults to the first part of the second piece. Will it resolve your entire domain? No, but keep in\nmind that knowing a single extra character could mean so much more for further passive\nDNS/OSINT work and potential informing victims/targets.\n\nFor those seeking additional passive DNS data or just want to check whether they are a\nvictim/target, I’ve got a sheet with 35k known public subdomains and their transmitted data\nover [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fpyFt0GL2Swxn0Ihw43eu-kM7HlJXni0EvFYqqMRTz8/)\n\n\n-----\n\nOverview of data in the sheet mentioned above.\n**I do want to point out that if your domain/hostname is not in this sheet, that it does not**\n**mean you/your organisation are not affected. This is only information that is known**\npublicly upon this point.\n\nIf anyone has additional subdomains that are not in this sheet, feel free to share them with\nme through Twitter(tweet/dm) or the comment section in the sheet. As I want to contradict a\nquote from a previous story on the SUNBURST subject;\n\n“the full extent of this breach will most likely never be communicated to the public, and\ninstead will be restricted to trusted parts of the intelligence community.”\n\nThe only way the public will not be able to determine the full extent of this breach on its own\nis by hiding the information that we as a security community have on this attack. This is not\nyour regular hacking/leaked database incident, based on both the sophistication of the\ncampaign and the targeted organisations. I understand that networks need to get\ninvestigated and cleaned first, but I would like to ask every affected organisation to be open\nabout their infection(s) and the steps taken afterwards. As for those having access to more\nDNS data, keep in mind that this is a joint effort and that we’re all missing pieces. Sharing is\ncaring. Follow the example of FireEye. We need subdomains to match domains with pings,\nwe need CNAMES to match with targets, etc. Security isn’t always a business model.\n\n\n-----",
