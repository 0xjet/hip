This stealer collects credentials and files of interest from the victim’s computer and\nexfiltrates them to an FTP server. It is designed to autonomously collect and exfiltrate data\nrather than receiving commands from an operator through a command-and-control channel.\nThe EvilExtractor creators market this feature as a “golden bullet”.\n\nReal hackers don’t use reverse shells right? If you have only one bullet, would you\nwaste with reverse shell? Try Evil Extractor to have golden bullet.\n\n[I downloaded the Evil Extractor capture file from\nTriage to a](https://tria.ge/230424-vv9wvsfb2v/behavioral2) [Windows Sandbox environment,](https://netresec.com/?b=215d5b5)\nto avoid accidentally infecting my computer when extracting artifacts from the PCAP.\nI then\n[opened it up in the free version of NetworkMiner.](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Networkminer)\n\nNetworkMiner shows that after checking its public IP on ipinfo.io EvilExtractor makes an\nunencrypted HTTP connection to a web server on 193.42.33.232 to download KK2023.zip.\nThis zip archive contains a file called “Lst.exe” which is used to steal browser data, cookies\n[and credentials according to Fortinet.](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/evil-extractor-all-in-one-stealer)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image: Files downloaded from TCP port 80_\nTwenty seconds later an FTP connection is established to 89.116.53.55 on TCP port 21. The\nusername and password used to authenticate to the FTP server was “u999382941” and\n“Test1234”.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the FTP server EvilExtractor creates a directory named after the country and hostname\nof the victim's PC, such as “(Sweden)DESKTOP-VV03LJ”, in which it creates the following\nthree sub directories:\n\n1-Password-Cookies\n2-Credentials\n3-Files\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter uploading browser cookies, browser history and cached passwords from Chrome,\nFirefox and Edge to the “1-Password-Cookies” directory EvilExtractor sends a file called\n“Credentials.txt” to the “2-Credentials” directory. The contents of this text file looks something\nlike this:\n\nPublic IP: [redacted]\n\nLocation: [lat],[long]\n\nComputer Name: [redacted]\n\nUsername: Admin\n\nRAM: 4 GB\n\nOS Name: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro\n\nOS Bit: 64-bit\n\nKeyboard Language: en-US\n\nGPU: [redacted]\n\nCPU: Intel [redacted]\n\nMAC Address: [redacted]\n\nExtracted WIFI: [redacted]\n\nThe stealer also exfiltrates files with mpeg, docx, jpeg, pptx, zip, avi and rar extensions from\nthe victim PC to the “3-Files” directory on the FTP server.\nThe directory structure of the\nvictim’s PC is maintained on the FTP server, so that files from the victim's desktop end up in\na folder called “Desktop” on the FTP server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stealer later downloaded a keylogger module (Confirm.zip) and a webcam module\n(MnMs.zip), but no additional data was exfiltrated from this particular victim PC after that\npoint.\n\n**IOC List**\n\nWeb server: 193.42.33.232:80\nFTP server: 89.116.53.55:21\nEvilExtractor: 9650ac3a9de8d51fddab092c7956bdae\nKK2023.zip: f07b919ff71fb33ee0f77e9e02c5445b\nLst.exe: 163d4e2d75f8ce6c838bab888bf9629c\nConfirm.zip: 30532a6121cb33afc04eea2b8dcea461\nConfirm.exe: 0c18c4669e7ca7e4d21974ddcd24fdca\nMnMs.zip: bda0bda512d3e2a81fc9e4cf393091eb\nMnMs.exe: fb970c4367609860c2e5b17737a9f460\n\nUsers with an account on Triage can download the analyzed PCAP file from here:\n[https://tria.ge/230424-vv9wvsfb2v/behavioral2](https://tria.ge/230424-vv9wvsfb2v/behavioral2)\n\n**Update 2023-04-27**\n\n[Jane tweeted a link to an execution of this same sample on ANY.RUN. This execution](https://twitter.com/Jane_0sint/status/1651306419331661833)\nshowed very similar results as the one on Triage, but with an interesting twist. Not only did\nthe ANY.RUN execution exfiltrate images and documents from the Desktop and Downloads\nfolders, it also exfiltrated “vv9wvsfb2v_pw_infected.zip”, which contained the EvilExtractor\nEXE file that was being run!\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PCAP from the ANY.RUN execution can be downloaded from here:\n[https://app.any.run/tasks/43a11a79-4d1f-406c-86d7-158efb5ede01/](https://app.any.run/tasks/43a11a79-4d1f-406c-86d7-158efb5ede01/)\n\nPosted by Erik Hjelmvik on Wednesday, 26 April 2023 08:50:00 (UTC/GMT)\n\n[Tags: #FTP​\n#NetworkMiner​\n#Sandbox​\n#ANY.RUN​](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&tag=FTP)\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n» [EvilExtractor Network Forensics](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2023-04&post=EvilExtractor-Network-Forensics)\n\n» [QakBot C2 Traffic](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2023-03&post=QakBot-C2-Traffic)\n\n» [TLS Redirection and Dynamic Decryption Bypass in PolarProxy](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2023-02&post=TLS-Redirection-and-Dynamic-Decryption-Bypass-in-PolarProxy)\n\n» [How to Identify IcedID Network Traffic](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2023-02&post=How-to-Identify-IcedID-Network-Traffic)\n\n» [CapLoader 1.9.5 Alerts on Malicious Traffic](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2023-02&post=CapLoader-1-9-5-Alerts-on-Malicious-Traffic)\n\n» [Online Network Forensics Class](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2023-01&post=Online-Network-Forensics-Class)\n\n» [IEC-104 File Transfer Extraction](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2023-01&post=IEC-104-File-Transfer-Extraction)\n\n» [NetworkMiner 2.8 Released](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2023-01&post=NetworkMiner-2-8-Released)\n\n## Blog Archive\n\n» [2023 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2023)\n\n» [2022 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2022)\n\n\n-----\n\n» [2021 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2021)\n\n» [2020 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2020)\n\n» [2019 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2019)\n\n» [2018 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2018)\n\n» [2017 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2017)\n\n» [2016 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2016)\n\n» [2015 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2015)\n\n» [2014 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2014)\n\n» [2013 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2013)\n\n» [2012 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2012)\n\n» [2011 Blog Posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&year=2011)\n\n[List all blog posts](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&blogPostList=true)\n\n## News Feeds\n\n» [Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMIKCogswxYy6Aw)\n\n» [FeedBurner](https://feeds.feedburner.com/Netresec-Network-Security-Blog)\n\n» [RSS Feed](https://www.netresec.com/rss.ashx)\n\n[NETRESEC on Mastodon:\n@netresec@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@netresec)\n\nNETRESEC on Twitter: [@netresec](https://twitter.com/netresec)\n\n\n-----",
