Today, we’re sharing a few updates to make it easier for people to get information\nand offer support.\n\n**Supporting admins of emergency relief Facebook groups: We’re introducing a new**\nemergency relief feature set that makes it easier for admins of these communities to\nturn on features that empower members to come together and take action. Admins will\nbe able to give their group access to anonymous posts, guides, files, Q&As, events,\nand when eligible, the options to offer assistance or request help through Community\nHelp and raise money through nonprofit fundraisers. We recently announced feature\nsets as a way to allow admins to add curated collections of features and post formats\nto their groups with one click. Feature sets are still currently rolling out to groups, and\nthe emergency relief feature set will be available to groups globally who have access\nas well.\n**Making it easier for people to find nonprofits supporting Ukraine: We’ve already**\nseen more than $40 million raised across Instagram and Facebook for nonprofits\nsupporting humanitarian relief in Ukraine. Now, when someone searches for a nonprofit\nto fundraise for on Instagram, we’ll start showing organizations like UNICEF and World\nCentral Kitchen that are supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine first in many\ncountries around the world.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Helping Ukranians stay informed: Next week, we’ll start showing people in Ukraine a**\nmessage at the top of feed on Facebook in Ukranian to connect them to high-quality,\ntimely information to stay safe, find family and friends, and locate support services like\nhousing and immigration assistance. We’ve also added resources in the Emotional\nHealth Hub on Facebook, in both Ukrainian and English, to support those in need. The\nhub features content that helps parents and caregivers figure out how to discuss the\ncrisis with children, how to identify stress in children and how to navigate their own\nstress and anxiety during this time.\n**Collaborating with experts to share resources for parents and children: We’re**\n[collaborating with organizations such as UNICEF and the Child Mind Institute to](https://www.instagram.com/childmindinstitute/guide/helping-children-cope-after-a-traumatic-event/17932284173094940/)\ndistribute guides on Instagram with information on how parents can talk to their kids\nabout the crisis in an age-appropriate way. The guides will include topics like:\nunderstanding news headlines, dealing with fear and trauma, and ways to support\nthose affected.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Update on March 11, 2022 at 4:00PM PT:_**\n\n**Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri responded to Russia’s decision to block access to**\n**Instagram:**\n\nView this post on Instagram\n[A post shared by Adam Mosseri (@mosseri)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ca-4OyzBvik/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n\n**_Update on March 11, 2022 at 3:30PM PT:_**\n\n**President, Global Affairs Nick Clegg’s statement to reports that the Russian**\n**government is considering designating Meta as an extremist organization for its**\n**policies in support of speech:**\n\nThere has been a lot of coverage and discussion of how we are applying our policies to\nspeech in the context of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nI want to be crystal clear: our policies are focused on protecting people’s rights to speech as\nan expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country. The fact is, if\nwe applied our standard content policies without any adjustments we would now be\nremoving content from ordinary Ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury at the\ninvading military forces, which would rightly be viewed as unacceptable.\n\nTo be clear, we are only going to apply this policy in Ukraine itself. We have no quarrel with\nthe Russian people. There is no change at all in our policies on hate speech as far as the\nRussian people are concerned. We will not tolerate Russophobia or any kind of\ndiscrimination, harassment or violence towards Russians on our platform.\n\nThis is a temporary decision taken in extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances. We\nwill be keeping the situation under review in the period ahead.\n\n**_Update on March 8, 2022 at 9:00PM PT:_**\n\nAs the humanitarian crisis deepens, today we are announcing additional steps to help our\ncommunity access crucial resources and take action to support people in need.\n\n**Helping People Access Resources**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Updating Community Help: We re updating Community Help as a central resource on**\nFacebook where Ukrainians and others in the region can find reliable information from\nlocal UN agencies and Red Cross societies. This includes where to seek medical help,\nhow to stay safe and how to get assistance — both in Ukraine and once they have\ncrossed into neighboring countries. It also features access to Ukraine’s State\nEmergency Services information helpline on WhatsApp, which connects people with\ncritical information including emergency response procedures. We’ll show a link to\nCommunity Help at the top of people’s Facebook and Instagram feeds for people in\nUkraine or for those who have left recently for neighboring countries, letting them know\nthat this resource is available. It will also be available globally at\n[facebook.com/community_help_ukraine, as well as at the top of results for relevant](http://www.facebook.com/community_help_ukraine)\nsearches on Facebook.\n\n**Adding mental health resources: We will add new mental health tips and resources**\nfrom international organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO) and\n[International Medical Corps in the Emotional Health Center on Facebook. The](https://www.facebook.com/emotional_health/)\nresources will be available globally in Ukrainian, Russian and English and will offer\ninformation on topics such as what to do in times of stress and how to provide support\nto children during a crisis.\n**Helping organizations get their messages out with ads: We are supporting**\norganizations in their efforts to get critical messaging out to those affected by the crisis\nthrough free ad campaigns on our platforms. To give just one example, WHO is\npromoting information on breastfeeding for displaced mothers, and International\nMedical Corps is sharing tips on how to support mental health.\n**Reliable access to WHO Health Alert helpline: WhatsApp supports the WHO’s**\nresponse to the crisis through the Health Alert helpline. Part of the response includes\nfundraising efforts led by the WHO Foundation to enable vital healthcare provision.\nWHO is also reaching Health Alert users in Ukraine and some neighboring countries\nwith support on mental health. To access the Health Alert helpline add +41 79 893 18\n92 to your WhatsApp contacts and message “hi.”\n**Providing insights to partners supporting Ukrainian refugees: Our** [Data for Good](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/)\nteam continues to share privacy preserving datasets with trusted partners, including\ninformation on social connections between Ukraine and the rest of Europe, as well as\nreal time mobility data for countries bordering Ukraine, to help predict refugee flows.\nDirect Relief and Crisis Ready have produced a number of daily situation reports using\nthis information, which are in active use by groups like the World Bank, UNICEF and\nMédecins Sans Frontières.\n\n**Helping People Show Support for Ukraine**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Showing solidarity on Facebook: Since February 24, more than 3 million people**\nhave joined support groups on Facebook created to express solidarity with the\nUkrainian people, including local communities that are providing humanitarian aid,\naccommodation, legal advice or medical aid, among other forms of assistance. Also\nsince then, more than 10 million people have used the Ukrainian flag profile frame on\nFacebook.\n**Fundraising for nonprofits: Since February 23, people on Facebook and Instagram**\nhave raised more than $30 million for nonprofits supporting humanitarian relief in\nUkraine. This is the generosity of over 750,000 donors benefitting more than 1,500\nnonprofits. Donations are supporting both short- and long-term relief across Ukraine\nand for refugees in neighboring countries, including urgent medical care, shelter, food\nand transportation.\n\n**_Update on March 8, 2022 at 8:00AM PT:_**\n\nToday, we’re sharing updates that we’re making on Instagram to help keep people in Ukraine\nand Russia safe and reduce the spread of misinformation.\n\n**Keeping Information and Associations Private on Instagram: To help protect our**\ncommunities in Ukraine and Russia, we’ll now be hiding information about people’s followers,\nwho they’re following, and people who are following each other for private accounts based in\nthese two countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis means that people following private accounts based in Ukraine and Russia will no\nlonger be able to see who those accounts are following, or who follows them. We’re also not\nshowing these accounts in other people’s follower or following lists, or in our “mutual follows”\nfeature. We notified private accounts in Ukraine and Russia letting them know about this\nchange.\n\nWe’re also highlighting tools like Your Activity and Download Your Information to accounts in\nUkraine and Russia. Your Activity  allows people to bulk delete content they’ve posted like\n[photos and videos, as well as their previous likes and comments. Download Your Information](https://www.instagram.com/download/request/)\nallows people to get a copy of their Instagram data.\n\n**Addressing Russian State-Controlled Media on Instagram: Following last week’s**\nannouncement that we’ve begun demoting posts containing links to Russian state-controlled\nmedia on Facebook, starting today, Stories that contain a link sticker pointing to a Russian\nstate-controlled media website on Instagram will be placed lower in the Stories tray. We’ll\nalso label these Stories to let people know that they lead to Russian state-controlled media\nwebsites.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese changes are in addition to steps we’ve already taken to make content from accounts\nrun by Russian state-controlled media harder to find on Instagram, and to provide more\ntransparency if people try to share content from these accounts.\n\nSpecifically, we’re downranking posts from Russian state-controlled media in Feed, and\nplacing them lower in the Stories tray. We’re also showing people a notice before they\nreshare content from these accounts in their Stories, letting them know that the content\ncomes from Russian state-controlled media. If people still choose to reshare these posts to\ntheir Stories, we will place those Stories lower in the tray.\n\n\n-----\n\nLastly, we’re not recommending posts from Russian state-controlled media accounts in\nExplore and Reels, and we’re making these accounts harder to find in Search.\n\n**_Update on March 4, 2022 at 3:00PM PT:_**\n\nDespite the Russian government’s announcement that they will be blocking Facebook, we\nare working to keep our services available to the greatest extent possible. However, due to\nthe difficulties of operating in Russia at this time, ads targeting people in Russia will be\npaused, and advertisers within Russia will no longer be able to create or run ads anywhere in\nthe world, including within Russia.\n\n**_Update on March 4, 2022 at 11:15AM PT:_**\n\n**Update on Russia’s Decision to Block Access to Facebook: As a result of the Russian**\ngovernment’s decision to block access to Facebook in the Russian Federation, soon millions\nof ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their\neveryday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out. We will\ncontinue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people\nto safely and securely express themselves and organize for action.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Update on Restricting Access to RT and Sputnik: Earlier this week, we announced that**\nwe’d be restricting access to RT and Sputnik across the EU given the exceptional\ncircumstances. Consistent with that action, and following a request from the UK government,\nwe will also be restricting access to RT and Sputnik in the UK at this time.\n\n**_Update on March 3, 2022 at 4:50PM PT:_**\n\n**Increasing Our Support for Humanitarian Efforts: Today, we’re committing $15 million to**\nsupport humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and neighboring countries. This includes $5 million in\ndirect donations to UN agencies and more than a dozen nonprofits, including International\nMedical Corps who will be using these funds to deploy mobile medical units to Ukraine and\nInternews to support at-risk journalists and human rights defenders in the region. We’re also\ndonating to UNICEF to scale up lifesaving support for children and families in Ukraine and\nthe region. The remaining $10 million will be provided as ad credits, helping nonprofit\norganizations raise the funds they need to respond and deliver essential information to\npeople impacted by the violence.\n\n**_Update on March 1, 2022 at 6:05PM PT:_**\n\n**Update on State-Controlled Media Outlets: In addition to restricting access to RT and**\nSputnik across the EU, we are now globally demoting content from Facebook Pages and\nInstagram accounts from Russian state-controlled media outlets and making them harder to\nfind across our platforms.\n\nWe have also begun to demote posts that contain links to Russian state-controlled media\nwebsites on Facebook. In the days ahead, we will label these links and provide more\ninformation to people before they share or click on them to let them know that they lead to\nRussian state-controlled media websites. We plan on putting similar measures in place on\nInstagram.\n\nWe already label Facebook Pages and Instagram accounts from Russian state-controlled\nmedia outlets so people know where this information comes from. By providing this\nadditional transparency, we aim to give people more context if they want to share direct links\nto Russian state-controlled media websites or when others see someone’s post that contains\na link to one of these sites.\n\n**Reliable Access to Trusted Information: Ukraine’s State Emergency Services has**\nlaunched an information helpline on WhatsApp. The free service will connect users to critical\nupdates, reliable and trustworthy information, as well as details about emergency response\n[procedures. To use the free helpline on WhatsApp, simply save the number +380676785917](https://wa.me/380676785917?text=%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8)\nin your phone contacts and then text the word почати (begin) in a WhatsApp message to get\nstarted.\n\n\n-----\n\n**How Our Community Is Helping: Throughout this war and humanitarian crisis, we ve seen**\npeople across the world use our tools to make their voices heard and support each other. For\nexample, since February 23, more than $20 million has been raised for nonprofits on\nFacebook and Instagram in support of humanitarian efforts for Ukraine. (Updated on March\n**_2, 2022 at 10AM PT to reflect the latest fundraising amount.) We’ve also seen Facebook_**\nGroups created to help those in need, including a group of 200,000 Romanian volunteers\nand donors coordinating transportation and accommodations for refugees. And a group of\nmore than 300,000 in Poland is offering housing, clothing, medication and rides from the\nborder to help those in need.\n\n[Today, we’re also announcing that as part of our Data for Good program, we’re making](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/about)\naggregated data on social connections available to trusted organizations working to provide\nmedical services and support to refugees, like Direct Relief, which is using this data to better\nunderstand where people might be going so they can best support communities in need.\n\n**_Update on February 28, 2022 at 5:55PM PT:_**\n\nWe have received requests from a number of governments and the European Union to take\nfurther steps in relation to Russian state-controlled media. Given the exceptional nature of\nthe current situation, we will be restricting access to RT and Sputnik across the EU at this\ntime.\n\nAs of this morning, we’ve made encrypted one-to-one chats available on Instagram for all\nadults in Ukraine and Russia. We’ll also show notifications at the top of people’s direct\nmessage inboxes to let them know they can switch to an encrypted conversation if they want\nto. End-to-end encrypted chats are already available as an option on Messenger and by\ndefault on WhatsApp. This update is not available to business accounts on Instagram.\n\n**_Update on February 27, 2022 at 9:00PM PT:_**\n\nWe took down a network run by people in Ukraine and Russia targeting Ukraine for violating\n[our policy against coordinated inauthentic behavior. They ran websites posing as](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\nindependent news entities and created fake personas across many social media platforms\nincluding Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram, Odnoklassniki and VK.\n\nWe’ve also seen increased targeting of Ukrainian military and public figures by Ghostwriter, a\nthreat actor that has been [tracked for some time by the security community. We encourage](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\npeople in Ukraine and Russia to adopt stronger account security measures — like two-factor\nauthentication — to protect their information in the midst of this invasion. We continue to roll\nout privacy and security measures to help people in Ukraine and Russia protect their\naccounts from being targeted.\n\n[Learn more about our security updates in Ukraine.](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/security-updates-ukraine/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Update on February 27, 2022 at 11:45AM PT:_**\n\nWe have been in contact with the government of Ukraine. At their request, we have restricted\naccess to several accounts in Ukraine, including those belonging to some Russian state\nmedia organizations. We are also reviewing other government requests to restrict Russian\nstate-controlled media.\n\n**_Originally published on February 26, 2022 at 11:50AM PT:_**\n\nOur thoughts are with everyone affected by the war in Ukraine. We are taking extensive\nsteps across our apps to help ensure the safety of our community and support the people\nwho use our services — both in Ukraine and around the world.\n\nThe following are some of the specific steps we have taken regarding Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine:\n\n## Helping to Keep People in Ukraine Safe\n\nWe’ve added several safety features in Ukraine in response to the situation on the ground.\n\n**Lock Your Profile: This tool allows people to lock their Facebook profile in one step.**\nWhen someone’s profile is locked, people who aren’t their friends can’t download,\nenlarge or share their profile photo, nor can they see posts or other photos on\nsomeone’s profile, regardless of when they may have posted it. Our teams are working\nwith non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations to help ensure\npeople know these tools are available.\n**Friends Lists: We’ve temporarily removed the ability to view and search the friends**\nlists of Facebook accounts in Ukraine to help protect people from being targeted.\n**Instagram Privacy and Security Reminders: We’re sending everyone on Instagram**\nin Ukraine a top-of-feed notification about privacy and account security. For public\naccounts, we are reminding them to check their settings in case they want to make\ntheir accounts private. When someone makes their account private, any new followers\nwill need to be approved, and only their followers will be able to see their posts and\nstories. For people who already have private accounts, we’re sharing tips on how to\nkeep their account secure through strong passwords and two-factor authentication.\n**Privacy and Safety in Messenger: We’ve increased the tools available to Messenger**\nusers in Ukraine, such as by quickly rolling out notifications for screenshots of\ndisappearing messages in our end-to-end encrypted chats.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Secure Messaging on WhatsApp: As always, your personal messages and calls are**\nprotected with end-to-end encryption by default so they cannot be intercepted by any\n[government. You can now use “view once” media to send photos or video that vanish](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-view-once/?lang=en)\n[after being seen and “disappearing mode” to automatically erase all new chats after 24](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages/?lang=en)\nhours to protect information in case you lose your phone. We strongly recommend\n[everyone enable two-step verification to protect against hackers that could try to lock](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/verification/how-to-manage-two-step-verification-settings)\nyou out of your account.\n\n## Enforcing Our Policies\n\nWe are taking additional steps to enforce our Community Standards and Community\nGuidelines, not only in Ukraine and Russia but also in other countries globally where content\nmay be shared.\n\n[We are enforcing our policies around hate speech,](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/hate_speech) [violence and incitement and](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/credible_violence)\n[coordinating harm, amongst others, using technology to help us find content quickly –](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/coordinating_harm_publicizing_crime)\noften before people see it and report it to us.\nWe’ve established a special operations center staffed by experts from across the\ncompany, including native Russian and Ukrainian speakers, who are working around\nthe clock to monitor and respond to this rapidly evolving conflict in real-time. This\nallows us to remove content that violates our Community Standards or Community\nGuidelines faster and serves as another line of defense against misinformation.\nWe have teams of native Russian and Ukrainian content reviewers to help us review\npotentially violating content. We’re also using technology to help us scale the work of\nour content review teams and to prioritize what content those teams should be\nspending their time on, so we can take down more violating content before it goes\nviral.\nWe’re getting feedback from a network of local and international partners on emerging\nrisks and moving quickly to address these risks. We recognize that local context and\nlanguage-specific expertise is essential for this work, so we will remain in close\ncommunication with experts, partner institutions and non-governmental organizations.\nAs part of this effort, our security teams are continuing to monitor for emerging threats\nand enforce against malicious activity.\n\n## Reducing the Spread of Misinformation\n\nWe are taking extensive steps to fight the spread of misinformation on our services and\ncontinuing to consult with outside experts.\n\nWe’re removing content that violates our policies and working with third-party factcheckers in the region to debunk false claims. When they rate something as false, we\nmove this content lower in Feed so fewer people see it.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn response to the crisis, we have expanded our third-party fact-checking capacity in\nRussian and Ukrainian languages across the region and are working to provide\nadditional financial support to Ukrainian fact-checking partners.\nTo supplement labels from our fact-checking partners, we are warning users in the\nregion when they try to share some war-related images that our systems detect are\nover one year old so people have more information about outdated or misleading\nimages that could be taken out of context.\nWe’ve also made it easier for fact-checkers to find and rate content related to the war\nbecause we recognize that speed is especially important during breaking news events.\nWe use keyword detection to group related content in one place, making it easy for\nfact-checkers to find.\nWe’re also giving people more information to decide what to read, trust and share by\nadding warning labels on content rated false by third-party fact-checkers and applying\nlabels to state-controlled media publishers.\nMessenger, Instagram and WhatsApp have limits on message forwarding and label\nmessages that haven’t originated with the sender so people are aware that something\nis information from a third party.\nWe notify people who have previously shared or try to share fact-checked content so\nthey can decide for themselves whether it’s something they want to continue sharing.\nFacebook Pages, Groups, accounts and domains that repeatedly share false\ninformation will receive additional penalties. For example, we will remove them from\nrecommendations and show all of the content they post lower in Feed, so fewer people\nsee it.\nWe show a pop-up notification when you go to connect with a Facebook Page, Group\nor Instagram account that has repeatedly shared content that fact-checkers have rated\nfalse. You can also click to learn more, including that fact-checkers said some posts\nshared by this Page, Group or account included false information and a link to more\ninformation about our fact-checking program.\n\n## Transparency Around State-Controlled Media Outlets\n\n[We provide greater transparency on accounts from state-controlled media outlets, including](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/labeling-state-controlled-media/)\nRussian-based RT and Sputnik, because they combine the influence of a media organization\nwith the strategic backing of a state, and we believe people should know if the news they\nread is coming from a publication that may be under the influence of a government.\n\nWe are prohibiting ads from Russian state media and demonetizing their accounts.\nWe continue to apply labels to additional Russian state media.\nWe refused an order from the Russian authorities to stop the independent factchecking and labeling of content posted on Facebook by four Russian state media\norganizations.\nState controlled media, like other publishers, are eligible for fact-checking, and our\nthird-party fact-checking partners can and do rate their content.\n\n\n-----\n\nState controlled outlets must follow our Community Standards and Advertising Policies.\nAds and posts from state-controlled media outlets on Facebook and Instagram are\nlabeled prominently. We also apply these labels to Instagram profiles, the “About this\nAccount” section of Instagram accounts, the Page Transparency section of Facebook\nPages and in our Ads Library.\nWe [developed our definition and standards for state-controlled media organizations](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/labeling-state-controlled-media/)\nwith input from more than 65 experts around the world specializing in media,\ngovernance and human rights and development.\n\nWe remain vigilant to emerging trends and stand ready to take additional action to meet the\ndemands of this ongoing conflict.\n\nUkrainian Translation\n\n## Дії корпорації Метa у зв’язку з вторгненням Росії в Україну.\n\n**Ми створили центр спеціальних операцій, в якому працюють експерти з усієї**\n**компанії, в тому числі носії української та російської мови, які цілодобово**\n**стежать за платформою, що дозволяє нам реагувати на проблеми в режимі**\n**реального часу.**\n**Ми додали декілька функцій безпеки в Україні і Росії, зокрема можливість**\n**закрити свій профіль в Facebook, завдяки чому перегляд та пошук списків**\n**друзів буде заблоковано. Крім того ми додаємо нові інструменти в додатку**\n**Месенджер.**\n**Ми вживаємо значних заходів для боротьби з поширенням дезінформації,**\n**розширюючи можливості третьої сторони щодо перевірки фактів**\n**російською та українською мовами.Також ми забезпечуємо більше**\n**прозорості щодо контрольованих державою ЗМІ, забороняючи рекламу**\n**російських державних ЗМІ та демонетизуючи їх облікові записи.**\n\n**_Оновлено 17 березня 2022 року о 9:00AM PT:_**\n\nМи продовжуємо спостерігати за об’єднанням нашої спільноти, що має на меті\nдопомагати людям, які тікають від війни в Україні. Сьогодні ми хочемо поділитися\nдеякими оновленнями, які допоможуть людям легше отримувати інформацію та\nнадавати підтримку.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Підтримка адміністраторів груп екстреної допомоги у Facebook: ми**\nпредставляємо новий набір функцій екстреної допомоги, який полегшує\nадміністраторам груп увімкнення функцій, що надають змогу членам спільнот\nоб’єднатися та вжити конкретних заходів. Адміністратори зможуть надати своїй\nгрупі доступ до анонімних публікацій, посібників, файлів, запитань і відповідей та\nзаходів. Також, якщо це відповідатиме вимогам, адміністратори груп матимуть\nзмогу запропонувати допомогу або попросити про допомогу через платформу\n«Допомога спільноти» та збирати гроші за допомогою некомерційних організацій.\nНещодавно ми оголосили про запровадження набору функцій, які надають змогу\nадміністраторам додавати до своїх груп вибрані колекції функцій і форматів\nпублікацій одним натисканням клавіші миші. Набори цих функцій продовжують\nбути доступними для груп, а незабаром групам з усього світу також буде\nдоступний набір функцій екстреної допомоги.\n**Полегшення пошуку некомерційних організацій, які підтримують Україну: На**\nInstagram та Facebook некомерційними організаціям, які підтримують гуманітарну\nдопомогу в Україні вже було зібрано понад 40 мільйонів доларів. Від тепер, коли\nхтось шукатиме некомерційну організацію для збору коштів в Instagram, першими\nу результатах пошуку в багатьох країнах світу ми почнемо показувати такі\nорганізації, як ЮНІСЕФ і World Central Kitchen, які підтримують гуманітарні зусилля\nв Україні.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ми допомагаємо українцям бути в курсі найважливішої інформації:**\nНаступного тижня у верхній частині стрічки на Facebook ми почнемо показувати\nлюдям в Україні високоякісну, своєчасну інформацію українською мовою, яка\nдопоможе їм залишатися в безпеці, знаходити сім’ю та друзів, а також допомогу в\nпошуку житла та еміграційних питаннях. Ми також додали до Центру емоційного\nздоров’я у Facebook матеріали українською та англійською мовами, щоб\nзапевнити підтримку тим, хто цього потребує. У Центрі можна буде знайти\nінформацію, яка допоможе батькам і опікунам зрозуміти, як обговорювати тему\nкризи з дітьми, як визначити рівень стресу у дітей та як подолати власний стрес і\nтривогу в цей непростий час.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Співпраця з експертами для обміну ресурсами для батьків і дітей: Ми**\n**_співпрацюємо з такими організаціями, як ЮНІСЕФ та Child Mind Institute, з_**\n**_метою розповсюдження в Instagram посібників з інформацією про те, як_**\n**_батьки можуть говорити зі своїми дітьми про кризу відповідно до їх віку._**\n**_Посібники будуть торкатись таких тем як: розуміння заголовків новин,_**\n**_як боротися зі страхом і травмами та способи підтримки постраждалих._**\n\n**_Оновлено 11 березня 2022 року о 4:00PM PT:_**\n\nГлава Instagram Адам Моссері відповів на рішення Росії заблокувати доступ до\nInstagram:\n\nView this post on Instagram\n[A post shared by Adam Mosseri (@mosseri)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ca-4OyzBvik/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n\n**_Оновлено 11 березня 2022 року о 3:30PM PT:_**\n\nЗаява Ніка Клегга, президента відділу з міжнародних справ у Мета, у відповідь на\nповідомлення про те, що російський уряд розглядає можливість включення компанії\nМета в список екстремістських організацій за її політику на підтримку деяких\nвисловлювань:\n\nБуло багато повідомлень і дискусій про те, як ми застосовуємо нашу Політику щодо\nсвободи слова в контексті вторгнення Путіна в Україну.\n\nЯ хочу бути щирим: наша політика спрямована на захист прав людей на свободу слова,\nяка є одним з проявів самооборони, у відповідь на військове вторгнення в їхню країну.\nСправа в тому, що якби ми застосовували нашу стандартну політику щодо контенту без\nбудь-яких коригувань, ми б зараз видаляли контент простих українців, які виражають\nсвій опір і лють по відношенню до військових сил, які вторглися в їхню державу. Такі\nнаші дії були б справедливо розцінені як неприйнятні.\n\nДля ще більшої ясності, ми збираємося застосовувати цю політику тільки на території\nУкраїни. У нас немає ніяких непорозумінь з російським народом. У нашій політиці щодо\nмови ворожнечі немає ніяких змін в тому, що стосується росіян. Ми не потерпимо\nрусофобії або будь-якого виду дискримінації, переслідування або насильства по\nвідношенню до росіян на нашій платформі.\n\nЦе тимчасове рішення, прийняте в надзвичайних і безпрецедентних обставинах. Ми\nбудемо стежити за розвитком цієї ситуації в майбутньому.\n\n**_Оновлено 8 березня о 9:00PM PT:_**\n\n\n-----\n\nСьогодні ми оголошуємо про запровадження додаткових заходів, які допоможуть нашій\nспільноті отримати доступ до найважливіших ресурсів, а також вжити заходів для\nпідтримки людей, які цього потребують, у зв’язку із подальшим розвитком гуманітарної\nкризи.\n\n**Допомога людям у доступі до ресурсів**\n\nАктуалізація платформи “Допомога спільноти”: ми оновлюємо нашу платформу\n“Допомога спільноти” у Facebook, яка є основним джерелом достовірної\nінформації для українців та інших мешканців регіону від локальних підрозділів\nООН і Товариства Червоного Хреста. На цій платформі люди можуть знайти\nінформацію про те, куди звертатися за медичною допомогою, як себе захистити, а\nтакож як отримати необхідну допомогу в Україні та сусідніх країнах після перетину\nкордону. Платформа також надає доступ до інфолінії Державної служби з\nнадзвичайних ситуацій України у WhatsApp. Ця гаряча лінія дозволяє людям\nотримувати важливу інформацію, включаючи механізми реагування в\nнадзвичайних ситуаціях. Люди, які знаходяться на території України, а також ті,\nхто нещодавно виїхав за кордон зможуть побачити посилання на платформу\n“Допомога спільноти” у верхній частині їх стрічки у Facebook та Instagram. Ця\nплатформа також буде доступна по всьому світу за посиланням\n[facebook.com/community_help_ukraine, а також зверху результатів відповідних](https://facebook.com/community_help_ukraine)\nпошукових запитів у Facebook.\n**Додаємо ресурси для підтримки психічного здоров’я: Ми додаємо нові**\nресурси та поради для підтримки психічного здоров’я від міжнародних організацій\nдо нашого Центру емоційного здоров’я у Facebook. Це інформація від Всесвітньої\nорганізації охорони здоров’я (ВООЗ) та Міжнародного медичного корпусу (IMC).\nДані ресурси будуть доступні по всьому світу українською, російською та\nанглійською мовами і надаватимуть інформацію про те, як впоратися зі стресом та\nяк підтримувати дітей під час кризових ситуацій.\n**Допомагаємо організаціям донести свою інформацію через рекламу: ми**\nпідтримуємо організації в їхніх зусиллях надати найважливішу інформацію людям,\nякі постраждали від кризи, за допомогою безкоштовних рекламних кампаній на\nнаших платформах. Наприклад, ВООЗ поширює інформацію про грудне\nвигодовування для матерів, які мусять весь час переміщуватися, а Міжнародний\nмедичний корпус (IMC) ділиться порадами про те, як підтримати своє психічне\nздоров’я.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Надійний доступ до телефону довіри Health Alert від ВООЗ : WhatsApp**\nпідтримує заходи, які вживає ВООЗ у зв’язку з кризою. Ці заходи включають у себе\nзбір коштів під керівництвом фонду ВООЗ для забезпечення життєво необхідного\nмедичного обслуговування. Окрім того ВООЗ також допомагає підтримувати\nпсихічне здоров’я людей за допомогою телефону довіри Health Alert в Україні та\nдеяких сусідніх країнах. Додайте номер +41 79 893 18 92 до ваших контактів у\nWhatsApp і напишіть”Привіт” (hi), щоб отримати доступ до телефону довіри Health\nAlert.\n**Надання інформації партнерам, які підтримують українських біженців:**\nкоманда Data for Good продовжує ділитися даними про конфіденційність з нашими\nнадійними партнерами. До цих даних належить інформація про соціальні зв’язки\nміж Україною та іншими країнами Європи, а також дані про пересування з країн,\nщо межують з Україною в реальному часі. Отримана інформація допоможе\nпередбачити потоки біженців, які прямують до цих країн. На підставі цих даних,\nDirect Relief і Crisis Ready вже підготували щоденні звіти, які активно\nвикористовуються такими установами як Світовий банк та ЮНІСЕФ, а також\nміжнародною медичною гуманітарною організацією “Лікарі без кордонів”.\n\n**Допомагаємо людям демонструвати їхню підтримку Україні**\n\n**Прояв солідарності на Facebook: з 24 лютого понад 3 мільйони людей**\nприєдналися до груп підтримки у Facebook, як створені з метою прояву\nсолідарності з українським народом. До цих груп належать місцеві спільноти, які\nнадають гуманітарну та медичну допомогу, житло, юридичні консультації та інші\nвиди підтримки. Також понад 10 мільйонів людей додало український прапор як\nрамку фотографії свого профілю у Facebook.\n**Збір коштів для некомерційних організацій: з 23 лютого користувачі Facebook і**\nInstagram зібрали понад 30 мільйонів доларів для некомерційних організацій, які\nнадають гуманітарну допомогу в Україні. Завдяки щедрості понад 750 000\nблагодійників, більш ніж 1 500 організацій дістали фінансову підтримку.\nПожертвування спрямовані на короткострокову і довгострокову допомогу для всієї\nУкраїни, а також для українських біженців, включаючи термінову медичну\nдопомогу, житло, продукти харчування та транспорт.\n\n**_Оновлено 8 березня 2022 року о 8:00AM PT:_**\n\nСьогодні ми ділимося нашими оновленнями в Instagram, які мають допомогти захистити\nлюдей в Україні та Росії, а також зменшити поширення дезінформації.\n\n**Збереження конфіденційності інформації та зв’язків в Instagram: з метою захисту**\nнаших спільнот в Україні та Росії, відтепер ми будемо приховувати інформацію про\nВаших підписників, підписки та взаємні підписки. Ці зміни стосуються приватних\nоблікових записів людей, які проживають на території цих двох країн.\n\n\n-----\n\nЦе означає, що люди, які стежать за приватними акаунтами користувачів з України та\nРосії, більше не зможуть побачити, за ким стежать ці акаунти або хто стежить за ними.\nМи також не будемо показувати ці облікові записи серед підписників інших людей, а\nтакож у нашій функції “взаємні підписки”. Ми вже повідомили власників приватних\nакаунтів з України та Росії про ці зміни.\n\nВласникам акаунтів в Україні та Росії ми також нагадуємо про існування таких функцій\nяк: “Ваша активність” та “Завантажити інформацію”. Функція “Ваша активність”\nдозволяє людям масово видаляти розміщений ними контент, наприклад, фотографії та\nвідео, а також попередні лайки і коментарі. “Завантажити інформацію” дозволяє людям\nотримати копію своїх даних в Instagram.\n\n**Наша відповідь російським державним ЗМІ в Instagram: Минулого тижня ми**\nоголосили про початок зниження рейтингів постів, що містять посилання на російські\nдержавні ЗМІ у Facebook. А вже від сьогодні Stories, що містять стікер з посиланням на\nсайт російського державного ЗМІ в Instagram, будуть розміщуватися в кінці стрічки. Ми\nтакож будемо відповідним чином позначати ці Stories для інформування людей про те\nщо ці посилання ведуть на сайти російських державних ЗМІ.\n\nЦі зміни доповнюють кроки, які ми вже встигли зробити, щоб контент від російських\nдержавних ЗМІ було складніше знайти в Instagram. Крім цього, це було зроблено для\nзабезпечення більшої прозорості, якщо люди намагатимуться поділитися інформацією,\nрозміщеною на сторінках цих ЗМІ.\n\nЗокрема, ми знижуємо рейтинг постів від російських державних ЗМІ у загальній стрічці,\nа також розміщуємо їх далі у стрічці Stories. Крім цього, перш ніж люди захочуть\nзробити репост будь-якої інформації з цих сторінок до себе у Stories, ми сповіщатимемо\nїх, що інформація належить російським державним ЗМІ. Якщо люди все ж вирішать\nзробити репост з тих сторінок до себе у Stories, ми розмістимо ці історії далі в стрічці.\n\nПідсумовуючи, ми не рекомендуємо публікувати інформацію зі сторінок російських\nдержавних ЗМІ в Explore і Reels, а також ускладнюємо пошук таких акаунтів.\n\n**_Оновлено 4 березня 2022 року о 3.00PM PT:_**\n\nНезважаючи на оголошення російського уряду про блокування Facebook на території\nкраїни, ми працюємо над тим, щоб наші послуги залишалися доступними якомога\nдовше. Однак через труднощі в функціонуванні на території Росії, рекламу орієнтовану\nна її мешканців, буде призупинено. Крім цього, російські рекламодавці більше не\nматимуть змогу створювати або показувати рекламу в будь якій точці світу, в тому числі\nв Росії.\n\n**_Оновлено 4 березня 2022 року о 11:15PM PT:_**\n\n\n-----\n\nАктуальна інформація щодо рішення Росії про блокування доступу до Facebook: У\nрезультаті рішення російського уряду про блокування доступу до Facebook на території\nРосійської Федерації, незабаром мільйони звичайних росіян будуть відрізані від\nдостовірної інформації, позбавлені своїх повсякденних способів спілкування з родиною\nта друзями та не матимуть можливості вільно висловити свої думки. Ми\nпродовжуватимемо робити все можливе задля відновлення наших послуг в країні, щоб\nвони залишалися доступними для людей, які хочуть безпечно та вільно висловлювати\nсвою думку та організовуватись до дій.\n\nАктуальна інформація щодо обмеження доступу до RT і Sputnik: Раніше цього тижня ми\nвже оголосили, що обмежимо доступ до RT і Sputnik на території всього Європейського\nСоюзу з огляду на виняткові обставини. Відповідно до цього рішення та на прохання\nуряду Великобританії, на цей час ми також обмежимо доступ до RT і Sputnik у Великій\nБританії.\n\n**_Оновленo 3 березня 2022 року о 4:50 PM PT:_**\n\n**Збільшуємо нашу гуманітарну допомогу: Сьогодні ми виділяємо 15 мільйонів**\nдоларів на гуманітарну допомогу для України та сусідніх країн. З них 5 мільйонів\nдоларів у вигляді прямих пожертвувань будуть перераховані понад десятьом\nнекомерційним організаціям, а також агенціям ООН. До цих організацій належать\nМіжнародний медичний корпус, який використовуватиме ці кошти для розгортання\nмобільних медичних підрозділів в Україні, та Інтерньюз, що підтримуватиме журналістів\nі правозахисників, які перебувають в зонах ризику. Ми також надамо кошти для\nЮНІСЕФ з метою збільшення життєво необхідної допомоги дітям та сім’ям в Україні і в\nцілому регіоні. 10 мільйонів доларів у вигляді рекламних купонів будуть надані\nнекомерційним організаціям, щоб допомогти їм зібрати необхідні кошти для реагування\nна потреби людей та надання необхідної інформації тим, хто постраждав від\nжорстокостих подій.\n\n**_Оновлено 1 березня 2022 року о 6:05 PM PT:_**\n\n**Актуальна інформація щодо державних ЗМІ: Ми обмежуємо доступ до RT і Sputnik**\nна території ЄС. Крім того, ми глобально знижуємо рейтинг сторінок Facebook і акаунтів\nInstagram, що належать російським державним ЗМІ, тому їх складніше знайти на наших\nплатформах.\n\nМи також почали знижувати рейтинг дописів на Facebook, що містять посилання на\nсайти російських державних ЗМІ. У найближчі дні ми будемо відповідно позначати ці\nпосилання і надавати людям більше інформації про те, що дані веб-адреси ведуть на\nсайти російських державних ЗМІ, ще перед тим, як користувачі вирішать перейти за\nпосиланнями, або поділитись ними з іншими. Ми плануємо вжити аналогічних заходів\nтакож в Instagram.\n\n\n-----\n\nМи вже позначаємо сторінки в Facebook і акаунти в Instagram російських державних\nЗМІ, щоб люди знали, звідки надходить інформація. З метою забезпечення прозорості,\nми прагнемо надавати людям більше контексту в моменті, коли вони хочуть поділитися\nпосиланнями російських державних ЗМІ, або ж коли бачать публікації, що містять ці\nпосилання.\n\n**Надійний доступ до достовірної інформації: Державна служба з надзвичайних**\nситуацій України запустила інформаційну гарячу лінію в WhatsApp. Ця безкоштовна\nпослуга дозволяє користувачам отримувати важливі сповіщення, надійну і достовірну\nінформацію, а також детальні інструкції про те,як варто реагувати в надзвичайних\nситуаціях.

Наприклад, на підтримку некомерційних організацій, що надають\nгуманітарну допомогу Україні, з 23 лютого на Facebook і Instagram було зібрано понад\n20 мільйонів доларів. Ми також помітили численні групи в Facebook, створені для\nнадання допомоги людям, котрим вона необхідна. До цих груп належить спільнота з\n200 000 румунських волонтерів та донорів, які координують надання транспорту та\nжитла для біженців, а також польська група з більш ніж 300 000 учасників, що забирає\nпостраждалих людей з кордону, пропонує їм житло, одяг та медикаменти.\n\n**_[Сьогодні ми оголошуємо, що в рамках нашої програми “Data for Good” ми](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/about__;!!BupLon6U!5xxM7J3tTA4GNMUwy5VDURS_0t4d5_6j2iP0Tmsb44REgVt4YhpuUP1qZ3Rbne6yfHAvUrrf%24)_**\n**_ділимося доступом до збору даних з довіреними організаціями, які працюють_**\n**_над тим, щоб надати біженцям допомогу, зокрема медичну.

Сповіщення\nпро можливість створення чатів з наскрізним шифруванням, люди зможуть побачити\nзверху своєї скриньки для приватних повідомлень. Наскрізні зашифровані чати вже\nдоступні в Messenger та за замовчуванням WhatsApp. Але це оновлення не буде\nдоступним для бізнес-акаунтів в Instagram.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Оновлено 27 лютого 2022 року о 9:00 PM PT:_**\n\nМи видалили мережу націлену на Україну, якою керували люди Росії та України, за\n[порушення нашої політики проти скоординованої неавтентичної поведінки.

Якщо профіль буде закритим, відвідувачі\nВашої сторінки Facebook, які були додані як друзі, не матимуть змоги\nзавантажувати, збільшувати чи ділитися фотографією закритого профілю, а також\nбачити публікації чи інші фотографії в чиємусь профілі, незалежно від того, коли\nбули опубліковані. Наші команди працюють з недержавними та суспільними\nгромадськими організаціями, щоб допомогти людям дізнатися про наявність цих\nінструментів.\n**Списки Друзів: ми тимчасово усунули можливість переглядати та шукати списки**\nдрузів в Україні з метою захисту наших користувачів.\n**Сповіщення про забезпечення конфіденційності і безпеки в Instagram: ми**\nнадсилаємо всім користувачам Instagram в Україні сповіщення зверху стрічки про\nконфіденційність та безпеку облікового запису. Особливо, для загальнодоступних\nоблікових записів, ми нагадуємо користувачам перевірити свої налаштування,\nякщо вони хочуть зробити свої облікові записи приватними. Якщо профіль стане\nприватним, користувач Instagram матиме змогу схвалити або ж не схвалити\nпрохання стежити сторінку від інших користувачів. Лише прийняті користувачі\nматимуть змогу бачити публікації та Stories. Для користувачів у яких вже є\nприватний обліковий запис, ми ділимося порадами щодо того, як захистити свій\nпрофіль за допомогою надійних паролів та двоетапної аутентифікації.\n**Конфіденційність та безпека в Messenger: ми розширили інструменти, доступні**\nкористувачам Messenger в Україні, наприклад, швидке розгортання сповіщення\nпро знімки екрану та зникаючі повідомлення в наскрізних зашифрованих чатах.\n**Безпечний обмін повідомленнями в WhatsApp: як завжди, ваші особисті**\nповідомлення і дзвінки захищені наскрізним шифруванням за замовчуванням,\nзавдяки цьому вони не можуть бути перехоплені жодним урядом. Тепер ви можете\nвикористовувати функцію “перегляд один раз” для відправки фотографій або\nвідео, які зникають після перегляду, а також “режим зникнення” для автоматичного\nвидалення всіх нових чатів через 24 години, щоб захистити інформацію в разі\nвтрати телефону.

Коли наші партнери\nоцінюють матеріал як неправдивий, ми переміщуємо цей контент вниз стрічки,\nщоб менше людей його бачили.\nУ відповідь на кризу, ми розширили можливості фактчекерів для перевріки\nінформації українською та російською мовами у всьому регіоні та працюємо над\nнаданням додаткової фінансової підтримки українським партнерам, котрі\nзаймаються перевіркою фактів.\nНа додаток до приміток наших фактчекінгових партнерів, ми попереджаємо\nкористувачів у регіоні, коли вони намагаються поділитися деякими зображеннями,\nпов’язаними з війною, які, на думку нашої системи, мають більш ніж річну\nдавність, щоб люди мали більше інформації про застарілі або оманливі\nзображення, які можуть бути вирвані з контексту.\nМи також полегшили фактчекерам пошук і оцінку вмісту, пов’язаного з війною,\nоскільки ми розуміємо, що швидкість є особливо важлива під час останніх подій.\nМи використовуємо виявлення ключових слів для групування пов’язаного вмісту в\nодному місці, що полегшує пошук фактів.\n\n\n-----\n\nМи також надаємо людям більше інформації, щоб вони могли вирішувати, що\nчитати, чому довіряти і чим ділитися, додаючи попереджувальні помітки на\nконтент, який сторонні фактчекери оцінили як неправдивий, і застосовуючи\nспеціальні помітки до ЗМІ контрольованих державою.\nMessenger, Instagram і WhatsApp мають обмеження на пересилання повідомлень і\nпозначають повідомлення, які не належать відправнику, щоб інформувати людей,\nякщо дане повідомлення є від третьої особи.\nМи повідомляємо людей, які раніше ділилися або намагалися ділитися\nперевіреним контентом, щоб вони могли самі вирішити, чи варто продовжувати\nділитися ним.\nСторінки, групи, акаунти та домени Facebook, які неодноразово діляться\nнеправдивою інформацією, отримають додаткові санкції. Наприклад, ми будемо\nвидаляти їх з рекомендацій і показувати весь контент, який вони публікують,\nнижче в стрічці, щоб його бачило менше людей.\nМи висилаємо повідомлення, коли Ви намагаєтеся підключитися до сторінки\nFacebook, групи або облікового запису Instagram, які неодноразово ділилися\nконтентом, фактчекерами як неправдивий. Ви також можете натиснути на кнопку,\nщоб дізнатися більше, в тому числі про те, що деякі повідомлення, опубліковані\nцією сторінкою, групою чи обліковим записом, містять неправдиву інформацію, а\nтакож, щоб знайти посилання на додаткову інформацію про нашу програму\nперевірки фактів.\n\n## ПРОЗОРІСТЬ ЩОДО ДЕРЖАВНИХ ЗМІ\n\nМи забезпечуємо [більшу прозорість облікових записів державних ЗМІ, включаючи](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/metas-ongoing-efforts-regarding-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/#:~:text=greater%20transparency)\nросійські RT і Sputnik, оскільки вони поєднують в собі вплив медійної організації і\nстратегічну підтримку держави. Ми також вважаємо, що люди повинні знати, чи\nнадходять новини, з якими вони ознайомлюються, від ЗМІ, перебуваючого під впливом\nуряду.\n\nМи забороняємо рекламу в російських державних ЗМІ і демонетизуємо їх акаунти.\nМи також продовжуємо додавати примітки на інші російські державні ЗМІ.\nМи відхилили наказ російської влади припинити незалежну перевірку фактів і\nмаркування контенту, розміщеного в Facebook чотирма російськими державними\nЗМІ.\nДержавні ЗМІ, як і інші видавці, мають право на перевірку фактів, і наші сторонні\nфактчекінгові партнери можуть оцінювати їх контент.\nДержавні ЗМІ повинні дотримуватися наших стандартів спільноти та рекламної\nполітики.\nОголошення та пости державних ЗМІ на Facebook і Instagram мають яскраве\nмаркування.

Мы также обеспечиваем большую прозрачность контролируемых**\n**государством СМИ, запрещаем рекламу российских государственных СМИ и**\n**отключаем монетизацию в их аккаунтах.**\n\n**Обновление от 17 марта 2022, 9:00AM PT:**\n\nМы по-прежнему наблюдаем, что наше сообщество объединяется, чтобы помочь\nлюдям, которые спасаются от войны в Украине. Сегодня мы делимся несколькими\nобновлениями, которые помогут людям еще проще получать информацию и оказывать\nподдержку.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Поддерживаем администраторов групп по оказанию чрезвычайной помощи**\n**в Facebook: Мы представляем новый набор функций для оказания помощи в**\nчрезвычайных ситуациях. Он облегчит администраторам сообществ включение\nфункций, позволяющих участникам объединиться и начать действовать.\nАдминистраторы смогут предоставлять своей группе доступ к анонимным постам,\nруководствам, файлам, подборкам вопросов и ответов, событиям, а также, при\nналичии соответствующих прав, возможность предлагать помощь или\nзапрашивать помощь через “Помощь сообщества” и собирать деньги через\nнекоммерческие фонды. Недавно мы анонсировали наборы функций как способ,\nкоторый позволяет администраторам одним щелчком мыши добавлять\nкурируемые ими наборы функций и форматов сообщений в свои группы. Наборы\nфункций постепенно становятся доступны группам. В настоящий момент наборы\nфункций постепенно запускаются для групп, и функции по оказанию\nчрезвычайной помощи будут доступны группам по всему миру, которые получат\nдоступ к наборам.\n**Помогаем найти некоммерческие организации, поддерживающие Украину:**\nУже более 40 миллионов долларов собрано в Instagram и Facebook в пользу\nнекоммерческих организаций, оказывающих гуманитарную помощь в Украине.\nТеперь, когда кто-то захочет найти некоммерческую организацию для сбора\nсредств на Instagram, во многих странах мира мы в первую очередь будем\nпоказывать такие организации, как ЮНИСЕФ и World Central Kitchen, которые\nоказывают гуманитарную поддержку Украине.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Помогаем украинцам быть в курсе происходящего: На следующей неделе мы**\nначнем показывать людям в Украине сообщение в верхней части ленты Facebook\nна украинском языке, чтобы дать им быстрый доступ к высококачественной и\nсвоевременной информации, которая поможет оставаться в безопасности, найти\nсемью, друзей и необходимые ресурсы, такие как жилье и помощь в переезде.\nМы также добавили ресурсы в центр эмоционального здоровья в Facebook на\nукраинском и английском языках, чтобы поддержать тех, кто в этом нуждается. В\nцентре собраны материалы, которые помогут родителям и опекунам понять, как\nобсуждать этот кризис с детьми, как распознать стресс у детей и справиться с\nсобственным стрессом и беспокойством в этой ситуации.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Сотрудничаем с экспертами и делимся знаниями с родителями и детьми:_**\n**_Мы сотрудничаем с такими организациями, как ЮНИСЕФ и Child Mind_**\n**_Institute, чтобы распространять в Instagram руководства о том, как_**\n**_говорить с детьми об этом кризисе с учетом их возраста.

У нас\nнет вражды с российским народом. В нашей политике в отношении языка ненависти\nнет никаких изменений в том, что касается россиян. Мы не потерпим русофобии или\nлюбого вида дискриминации, преследования или насилия по отношению к россиянам\nна нашей платформе.\n\nЭто временное решение, принятое в чрезвычайных и беспрецедентных\nобстоятельствах. Мы будем следить за предстоящим развитием ситуации.\n\n**_Обновление от 8 марта 9:00PM PT:_**\n\n\n-----\n\nВ связи с усугублением гуманитарного кризиса, сегодня мы объявляем о\nдополнительных шагах, которые помогут нашему сообществу получить доступ к\nважнейшим ресурсам и поддержать тех, кто нуждается в этом.\n\n**Помощь с доступом к ресурсам**\n\nОбновление раздела “Помощь сообщества”: Мы обновляем раздел “Помощь\nсообщества” как центральный ресурс на Facebook, где украинцы и другие жители\nрегиона могут найти достоверную информацию от местных агентств ООН и обществ\nКрасного Креста. Сюда входит информация о том, куда обращаться за медицинской\nпомощью, как оставаться в безопасности и как получить помощь – как в Украине, так и\nпосле пересечения границы с соседними странами. Также существует\nинформационная горячая линия Государственной службы по чрезвычайным ситуациям\nУкраины в WhatsApp, которая позволяет людям получать важную информацию,\nвключая процедуры реагирования на чрезвычайные ситуации. Ссылка на “Помощь\nсообщества” появится в верхней части лент Facebook и Instagram для людей в Украине\nили тех, кто недавно выехал в соседние страны, чтобы они знали, что этот ресурс\nдоступен. Он также будет доступен во всем мире на странице\n[facebook.com/community_help_ukraine, а также в топе результатов для соответствующих](http://www.facebook.com/community_help_ukraine)\nпоисковых запросов в Facebook.\n\n**Добавление ресурсов для ментального здоровья: Мы добавим новые советы и**\nресурсы от международных организаций, включая Всемирную организацию\nздравоохранения (ВОЗ) и Международный медицинский корпус (ММК), связанные с\nпсихическим здоровьем, в разделе [Центра эмоционального здоровья в Facebook.

Вот один из примеров: ВОЗ распространяет информацию о грудном\nвскармливании для перемещенных матерей, а Международный медицинский корпус\n(ММК) делится советами о том, как поддержать психическое здоровье.\n\n**Надежный доступ к линии доверия ВОЗ Health Alert: WhatsApp поддерживает**\nответ ВОЗ на кризис в виде линии доверия Health Alert. Часть мер – сбор средств\nпод руководством Фонда ВОЗ для обеспечения жизненно важного медицинского\nобслуживания. ВОЗ также предоставляет пользователям Health Alert в Украине и\nнекоторых соседних странах поддержку по вопросам психического здоровья.\nЧтобы получить доступ к телефону доверия Health Alert, добавьте +41 79 893 18\n92 в контакты WhatsApp и напишите “привет”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Предоставление информации партнерам, оказывающим поддержку**\n**украинским беженцам: При условии сохранения конфиденциальности, наша**\n[команда Data for Good продолжает делиться с надежными партнерами наборами](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://dataforgood.facebook.com/__;!!BupLon6U!4eS9bFO52j6ap-l-_0Ns9RoCjICCLPx8rDyJHkHs3dQpNVdnd68INh3AYm06glBwlfoVOUo%24)\nданных. Это в том числе информация о социальных связях между Украиной и\nостальной Европой, а также данные о мобильности в странах, граничащих с\nУкраиной в реальном времени, которые помогут предсказать потоки беженцев.\nDirect Relief и Crisis Ready подготовили ряд ежедневных отчетов о ситуации,\nиспользуя эту информацию, которая активно используется такими группами, как\nВсемирный банк, ЮНИСЕФ и “Врачи без границ”.\n\n**Помощь пользователям в выражении поддержки Украине**\n\n**Проявление солидарности на Facebook: С 24 февраля более 3 миллионов**\nчеловек присоединились к группам поддержки в Facebook, созданным для\nвыражения солидарности с украинским народом, включая местные сообщества,\nкоторые предоставляют гуманитарную помощь, жилье, юридические консультации\nили медицинскую помощь, среди прочих форм помощи. Также с тех пор более 10\nмиллионов человек использовали рамку профиля с украинским флагом в\nFacebook.\n**Сбор средств для некоммерческих организаций: С 23 февраля пользователи**\nFacebook и Instagram собрали более 30 миллионов долларов для\nнекоммерческих организаций, оказывающих гуманитарную помощь в Украине.\nЩедрость более 750 000 человек помогла более чем 1 500 некоммерческим\nорганизациям. Пожертвования направлены на краткосрочную и долгосрочную\nпомощь по всей Украине и беженцам в соседних странах, включая экстренную\nмедицинскую помощь, жилье, продукты питания и транспорт.\n\n**_Обновление от 8 марта 2022 года, 8:00 AM PT:_**\n\nСегодня мы делимся обновлениями в Instagram, которые помогут обеспечить\nбезопасность людей в Украине и России и уменьшить распространение\nдезинформации.\n\n**Сохранение конфиденциальности информации и связей в Instagram: Чтобы**\nпомочь защитить наши сообщества в Украине и России, мы будем скрывать\nинформацию о подписчиках, подписках, и о людях, которые друг на друга подписаны,\nдля закрытых аккаунтов из этих двух стран.\n\nЭто означает, что люди, подписанные на закрытые аккаунты из Украины и России,\nбольше не смогут видеть, кто подписан на эти аккаунты и на кого подписаны они. Мы\nтакже не будем показывать эти аккаунты в списках подписчиков и подписок других\nлюдей, а также во “взаимных подписках”. Мы уведомили закрытые аккаунты в Украине\nи России, чтобы они знали об этом изменении.\n\n\n-----\n\nМы также обращаем внимание аккаунтов в Украине и России на такие инструменты,\nкак “Ваша активность” и “Скачать вашу информацию”. Первый позволяет\nпользователям массово удалять размещенный ими контент, например, фотографии и\nвидео, а также их лайки и комментарии. Второй инструмент позволяет людям получить\nкопию своих данных Instagram.\n\n**Российские СМИ, контролируемые государством, в Instagram: В продолжение**\nнаших действий по понижению в выдаче постов со ссылками на российские\nгосударственные СМИ в Facebook, с сегодняшнего дня Stories в Instagram, содержащие\nстикер со ссылкой на сайт российского государственного СМИ, будут размещаться\nниже в панели Stories. Мы также будем маркировать эти Stories, чтобы люди знали, что\nони ведут на сайты российских государственных СМИ.\n\nЭти изменения дополняют шаги, которые мы уже предприняли, чтобы сделать контент\nс аккаунтов российских государственных СМИ более трудно обнаруживаемым в\nInstagram и обеспечить большую прозрачность, когда пользователи пытаются делиться\nконтентом с этих аккаунтов.\n\nВ частности, мы понижаем в выдаче посты российских государственных СМИ в\nновостной ленте и размещаем их ниже в панели Stories. Мы также показываем людям\nуведомление перед репостом контента с этих аккаунтов в Stories, сообщая им, что это\nконтент российских государственных СМИ. Если пользователи все же решат\nрепостнуть эти посты в свои Stories, мы поместим эти Stories ниже в выдаче.\n\nНаконец, мы не будем рекомендовать посты российских государственных СМИ во\nвкладках “Интересное” и Reels, а также усложним поиск этих аккаунтов.\n\n**_Обновление от 4 марта 2022 в 3:00PM PT:_**\n\nНесмотря на заявление российских властей о блокировке Facebook, мы работаем над\nтем, чтобы наши услуги были доступны, насколько это возможно. Однако, в связи с\nтрудностями работы в России в настоящее время, показ рекламы, таргетированной на\nлюдей в России, будет приостановлен, а рекламодатели в России больше не смогут\nсоздавать или запускать рекламу для любой точки мира, включая Россию.\n\n**_Обновление от 4 марта 2022 в 11:15AM PT:_**\n\n**Обновление касательно решения российских властей заблокировать доступ к**\n**Facebook: В результате решения российских властей заблокировать доступ к Facebook**\nна территории Российской Федерации, вскоре миллионы простых россиян окажутся\nотрезанными от достоверной информации, лишенными повседневных способов связи\nс семьей и друзьями и возможности высказывать свое мнение. Мы будем продолжать\nделать все возможное для восстановления наших сервисов, чтобы люди могли\nбезопасно выражать свое мнение и координировать действия.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Обновление касательно ограничения доступа к RT и Sputnik: Ранее мы объявили о**\nтом, что ограничим доступ к RT и Sputnik на территории ЕС, учитывая исключительные\nобстоятельства. В соответствии с этим решением и по просьбе правительства\nВеликобритании мы также ограничиваем доступ к RT и Sputnik в Великобритании.\n\n**_Обновление от 3 марта 2022 в 4:50PM PT:_**\n\nУвеличение гуманитарной помощи: Сегодня мы выделяем 15 миллионов долларов на\nподдержку гуманитарных усилий в Украине и соседних странах. Это включает 5\nмиллионов долларов в виде прямых пожертвований агентствам ООН и более чем\nдесятку некоммерческим организациям, включая Международный медицинский корпус,\nкоторый будет использовать эти средства для развертывания мобильных медицинских\nпунктов в Украине. Помощь также будет направлена Internews для поддержки\nподвергающихся риску журналистов и правозащитников в регионе. Мы также\nпредоставляем средства ЮНИСЕФ для расширения усилий по оказанию жизненно\nважной помощи детям и семьям в Украине и регионе. Остальные 10 миллионов\nдолларов будут предоставлены в виде рекламных купонов. Они помогут\nнекоммерческим организациям в сборе средств, необходимых для реагирования и\nпредоставления важной информации людям, пострадавшим в результате военных\nдействий.\n\n**_Обновление от 1 марта 2022 года 6:05 PM PT:_**\n\n**Обновление информации о СМИ, контролируемых государством: В дополнение к**\nограничению доступа к RT и Sputnik на территории ЕС, теперь во всем мире мы также\nпонижаем в выдаче контент со страниц Facebook и аккаунтов Instagram российских\nгосударственных СМИ, а также затрудняем их поиск на наших платформах.\n\nМы также начали понижать в выдаче посты, содержащие ссылки на сайты российских\nгосударственных СМИ в Facebook. В ближайшие дни мы будем помечать эти ссылки и\nпредоставлять людям больше контекста об источнике информации, прежде чем они\nподелятся ими или нажмут на них, чтобы они знали, что они ведут на сайты российских\nгосударственных СМИ. Мы планируем принять аналогичные меры в Instagram.\n\nМы уже маркируем страницы в Facebook и Instagram аккаунты российских СМИ,\nконтролируемых государством, чтобы люди знали, откуда поступает эта информация.\nОбеспечивая дополнительную прозрачность, мы стремимся дать людям больше\nконтекста, если они хотят поделиться прямыми ссылками на сайты российских\nгосударственных СМИ или когда другие видят чей-то пост, содержащий ссылку на один\nиз этих сайтов.\n\n**Надежный доступ к достоверной информации: Государственная служба Украины по**\nчрезвычайным ситуациям запустила информационную горячую линию в WhatsApp.\nБесплатная услуга позволит пользователям получать важные обновления, надежную и\n\n\n-----\n\nдостоверную информацию, а также подробные сведения о процедурах реагирования\nна чрезвычайные ситуации.

Например, с 23 февраля на платформах Facebook и Instagram\nбыло собрано более 20 миллионов долларов для некоммерческих организаций в\nподдержку гуманитарной помощи для Украины. Мы также видели группы в Facebook,\nсозданные для помощи нуждающимся, включая группу из 200 000 румынских\nволонтеров и доноров, координирующих транспортировку и размещение беженцев, или\nпольскую группу из более чем 300 000 участников, предлагающую пострадавшим\nпомощь с логистикой после пересечения границы, а также с жильем, одеждой и\nмедикаментами.\n\n**_[Сегодня мы также объявляем, что в рамках нашей программы “Data for Good”](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/about)_**\n**_мы предоставляем агрегированные данные о социальных связях доверенным_**\n**_организациям, работающим над предоставлением медицинских услуг и_**\n**_поддержки беженцам.

Мы\nтакже будем показывать уведомления в верхней части чатов в Instagram Direct, чтобы\nдать пользователям знать, что они могут переключиться на зашифрованный чат, если\nзахотят. Сквозные зашифрованные чаты уже доступны в качестве опции в Messenger и\nпо умолчанию в WhatsApp. Это обновление недоступно для бизнес-аккаунтов в\nInstagram.\n\n**_Обновление 27 февраля 2022 в 9:00PM PT:_**\n\nМы удалили сеть аккаунтов, которая таргетировалась на Украину и управлялась\nлюдьми из Украины и России, за нарушение нашей политики против\n[скоординированного недостоверного поведения. Они управляли веб-сайтами, которые](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\n\n\n-----\n\nвыдавали себя за независимые новостные организации, и создавали фальшивые\nличности во многих социальных сетях, включая Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube,\nTelegram, “Одноклассники” и VK.\n\nМы также наблюдаем активизацию атак на украинских военных и общественных\nдеятелей со стороны Ghostwriter – агента угроз, которого уже некоторое время\n[отслеживает сообщество экспертов по безопасности. Мы призываем жителей Украины](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\nи России принять более высокие меры безопасности учетных записей – например,\nдвухфакторную аутентификацию – для защиты своей информации в условиях этого\nвторжения.

Они также не могут видеть сообщения или другие\nфотографии на профиле пользователя, независимо от того, когда он их\nразместил. Наши команды работают с неправительственными и гражданскими\nорганизациями, чтобы помочь людям узнать, что эти инструменты доступны.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Списки друзей: Мы временно убрали возможность просматривать списки друзей**\nи искать в них контакты в аккаунтах Facebook в Украине, чтобы защитить людей\nот преследования.\n**Напоминания о конфиденциальности и безопасности в Instagram: Мы**\nотправляем всем пользователям Instagram в Украине уведомления в верхней\nчасти ленты о конфиденциальности и безопасности аккаунтов. Мы напоминаем\nоткрытым аккаунтам о необходимости зайти в настройки, если они хотят сделать\nсвой аккаунт приватным. Если кто-то сделает свой аккаунт приватным, все новые\nподписчики должны будут получить одобрение, и только после получения\nодобрения смогут видеть сообщения и истории аккаунта. Для тех, у кого уже есть\nприватные аккаунты, мы делимся советами о том, как обеспечить безопасность\nаккаунта с помощью надежных паролей и двухфакторной аутентификации.\n**Конфиденциальность и безопасность в Messenger: Мы расширили**\nинструменты, доступные пользователям Messenger в Украине, например, быстро\n[распространили уведомления о скриншотах и исчезновении сообщений в наших](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/messengernews.fb.com/2022/01/27/express-yourself-in-messengers-end-to-end-encrypted-chats/__;!!BupLon6U!8HF9N4xLThtUtQWAItE2mab9btReg0AYbvA2V7eR3-CvKOTOv9_ONDyPOCPfLNE55Khx%24)\nчатах со сквозным шифрованием.\n**Безопасный обмен сообщениями в WhatsApp: Как всегда, ваши личные**\nсообщения и звонки по умолчанию защищены сквозным шифрованием, поэтому\nони не могут быть перехвачены ни одним правительством. Теперь вы можете\nиспользовать функцию [“просмотр один раз” для отправки фотографий или видео,](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-view-once/?lang=en__;!!BupLon6U!8HF9N4xLThtUtQWAItE2mab9btReg0AYbvA2V7eR3-CvKOTOv9_ONDyPOCPfLMm04tAF%24)\nкоторые исчезают после просмотра, и [“режим исчезновения” для автоматического](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages/?lang=en__;!!BupLon6U!8HF9N4xLThtUtQWAItE2mab9btReg0AYbvA2V7eR3-CvKOTOv9_ONDyPOCPfLMhDgUsW%24)\nудаления всех новых чатов через 24 часа, чтобы защитить информацию в случае\nпотери телефона. Мы настоятельно рекомендуем всем включить двухшаговую\nпроверку для защиты от хакеров, которые могут попытаться заблокировать ваш\nаккаунт.\n\n## КОНТРОЛЬ ЗА СОБЛЮДЕНИЕМ НАШИХ ПРАВИЛ\n\nМы предпринимаем дополнительные шаги по контролю за соблюдением наших Норм\nсообщества и Принципов сообщества не только в Украине и России, но и в других\nстранах мира, где может распространяться контент.\n\nМы обеспечиваем соблюдение нашей политики в отношении [языка ненависти,](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.facebook.com/communitystandards/hate_speech__;!!BupLon6U!8HF9N4xLThtUtQWAItE2mab9btReg0AYbvA2V7eR3-CvKOTOv9_ONDyPOCPfLIUmKeYS%24)\n[насилия, подстрекательства и](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.facebook.com/communitystandards/credible_violence__;!!BupLon6U!8HF9N4xLThtUtQWAItE2mab9btReg0AYbvA2V7eR3-CvKOTOv9_ONDyPOCPfLIVBdX-P%24) [координации вреда, в том числе с помощью](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.facebook.com/communitystandards/coordinating_harm_publicizing_crime__;!!BupLon6U!8HF9N4xLThtUtQWAItE2mab9btReg0AYbvA2V7eR3-CvKOTOv9_ONDyPOCPfLHr3-XEk%24)\nтехнологий, помогающих нам быстро находить контент – часто до того, как люди\nувидят его и сообщат нам о нем.\nМы создали специальный ситуационный центр, в котором работают эксперты со\nвсей компании, включая носителей русского и украинского языков, которые\nкруглосуточно отслеживают и реагируют на эту быстро развивающуюся ситуацию\nв режиме реального времени. Это позволяет нам быстрее удалять контент,\nнарушающий наши Нормы сообщества или Принципы сообщества, и служит еще\nодной линией защиты от дезинформации.\n\n\n-----\n\nУ нас есть команды специалистов, говорящих на русском и украинском языках,\nкоторые помогают нам проверять потенциально нарушающий стандарты контент.\nМы также используем технологии, которые помогают нам масштабировать работу\nнаших команд по проверке контента и определять приоритеты, на какой контент\nэти команды должны обратить внимание в первую очередь, чтобы удалить\nбольше нарушающего контента до того, как он станет вирусным.\nМы получаем отзывы от местных и международных партнеров о возникающих\nрисках и быстро принимаем меры для определения ответных мер. Мы понимаем,\nчто для этой работы очень важны понимание локального контекста и знания\nязыка, поэтому мы будем поддерживать тесную связь с экспертами, партнерскими\nучреждениями и неправительственными организациями.\nВ рамках этой работы наши службы безопасности продолжают отслеживать\nвозникающие угрозы и принимать меры против вредоносной деятельности.\n\n## СОКРАЩЕНИЕ РАСПРОСТРАНЕНИЯ ДЕЗИНФОРМАЦИИ\n\nМы предпринимаем масштабные меры по борьбе с распространением дезинформации\nна наших сервисах и продолжаем консультироваться со сторонними экспертами.\n\nМы удаляем контент, нарушающий наши правила, и сотрудничаем со сторонними\nорганизациями по проверке фактов в регионе, чтобы опровергнуть ложные\nутверждения. Когда они оценивают сообщение как ложное, мы перемещаем этот\nконтент ниже в ленте, чтобы его увидело меньше людей.\nВ ответ на кризис мы расширили возможности сторонней проверки фактов на\nрусском и украинском языках во всем регионе и работаем над оказанием\nдополнительной финансовой поддержки украинским партнерам по проверке\nфактов.\nВ дополнение к данным наших партнеров по проверке фактов мы предупреждаем\nпользователей в регионе, когда они пытаются поделиться связанными с войной\nизображениями, которые, по данным наших систем, имеют более чем годичную\nдавность. Это делается для того, чтобы у людей было больше информации об\nустаревших или вводящих в заблуждение изображениях, которые могут быть\nвырваны из контекста.\nМы также упростили поиск и оценку контента, связанного с войной, для\nспециалистов по проверке фактов, так как понимаем, что скорость особенно\nважна во время появления срочных новостей. Мы используем технологию\nопределение ключевых слов для группировки связанного контента в одном месте,\nчто облегчает его поиск для специалистов по проверке фактов.\nМы также предоставляем людям больше информации для принятия решения о\nтом, что читать, чему доверять и чем делиться, добавляя предупреждающую\nмаркировку на контент, оцененный как ложный сторонними специалистами по\nпроверке фактов. Также маркировка применяется к аккаунтам СМИ,\nконтролируемым государством.\n\n\n-----\n\nВ Messenger, Instagram и WhatsApp введены ограничения на пересылку\nсообщений. Сообщения, которые не принадлежат отправителю, имеют\nмаркировку, чтобы люди знали, что это информация от третьего лица.\nМы уведомляем людей, которые ранее делились или пытаются поделиться\nпрошедшим фактчекинг контентом, чтобы они могли сами решить, стоит ли\nпродолжать делиться им.\nСтраницы, группы, аккаунты и домены, которые неоднократно делятся ложной\nинформацией, получат дополнительные ограничения. Например, мы будем\nудалять их из рекомендаций и показывать весь контент, который они публикуют,\nниже в ленте, чтобы его видело меньше людей.\nМы показываем всплывающее уведомление, когда вы пытаетесь подключиться к\nстранице или группе Facebook, аккаунту Instagram, которые неоднократно\nделились контентом, оцененным специалистами по проверке фактов как ложный.\nВы также можете узнать больше, в том числе о том, что специалисты по проверке\nфактов отметили некоторые сообщения, опубликованные этой страницей, группой\nили аккаунтом, как содержащие ложную информацию. Вы также сможете\nознакомиться с дополнительной информацией о нашей программе проверки\nфактов, пройдя по ссылке.\n\n## ПРОЗРАЧНОСТЬ СМИ, КОНТРОЛИРУЕМЫХ ГОСУДАРСТВОМ\n\nМы обеспечиваем [большую прозрачность аккаунтов государственных СМИ, включая](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/labeling-state-controlled-media/)\nроссийские RT и Sputnik, поскольку они сочетают в себе влияние медийных\nорганизаций со стратегической поддержкой государства. Мы считаем, что люди\nдолжны знать, поступают ли новости, которые они читают, от издания, которое может\nнаходиться под влиянием правительства.\n\nМы запрещаем рекламу российских государственных СМИ и демонетизируем их\nаккаунты.\nМы продолжаем применять маркировку для большего числа российских\nгосударственных СМИ.\nМы отклонили запрос российских властей прекратить независимую проверку\nфактов и маркировку контента, размещенного в Facebook четырьмя российскими\nгосударственными СМИ.\nКонтент государственных СМИ, как и других издателей, подлежит фактчекингу.\nНаши сторонние партнеры по проверке фактов могут оценивать их контент и\nделают это.\nГосударственные СМИ должны следовать нашим Нормам сообщества и\nрекламной политике.\nРеклама и посты государственных СМИ в Facebook и Instagram имеют заметную\nмаркировку. Мы также размещаем маркировку в профилях Instagram – в разделе\n“Об этом аккаунте”, в Facebook – в разделе “Прозрачность страницы” и в нашей\nБиблиотеке рекламы.\n\n\n-----\n\nМы [разработали наше определение и стандарты для контролируемых](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/labeling-state-controlled-media/)\nгосударством медиаорганизаций с участием более 65 экспертов по всему миру,\nспециализирующихся на СМИ, управлении, правах человека и развитии.\n\nМы по-прежнему бдительно следим за развитием событий и готовы предпринять\nдополнительные действия в соответствии с требованиями сложившейся ситуации.\n\n\n-----",
