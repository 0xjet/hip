The trojanized file delivers a backdoor, dubbed SUNBURST by FireEye (and\nSolorigate by Microsoft), that communicates to third-party servers for command and control\nand malicious file transfer giving the attacker a foothold on the affected system with elevated\nprivileges. From there, additional actions on the objective, such as lateral movement and\ndata exfiltration, are possible. Since release of the initial blog from FireEye, subsequent\n_[additional analysis by McAfee and the industry as well as alerts by CISA, we have seen the](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/additional-analysis-into-the-sunburst-backdoor/)_\n_attack grow in size, breadth and complexity. We will continue to update defensive_\n_recommendation blogs like this as new details emerge._\n\n[The use of a compromised software supply chain as an Initial Access technique (T1195.002)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002/)\nis particularly dangerous as the attack uses assumed trusted paths and as such can go\nundetected for a long period. This attack leveraged several techniques, such as trusted\nsoftware, signed code and stealthy hiding-in-plain-sight communication, allowing the attacker\nto evade even strong defenses and enjoy a long dwell before detection. The sophisticated\n\n\n-----\n\nnature of the attack suggests that an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Group is likely\nresponsible. In fact, FireEye is tracking the group as UNC2452 and has released\n[countermeasures to identify the initial SUNBURST backdoor. McAfee has also provided an](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures)\n[intelligence summary within MVISION Insights and mitigation controls for the initial entry](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/insights-preview.html)\n[vectors are published in KB93861. For additional response actions, please view Part One of](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB93861)\n[this blog series here. If you are using SolarWinds software, please refer to the company](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/sunburst-malware-and-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/)\n[guidance here to check for vulnerable versions and patch information.](https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory)\n\nHowever, looking beyond the initial entry and containment actions, you should think about\nhow you are prepared for this type of attack in the future. This is a sophisticated actor(s) who\nmay use other techniques such as Spearphishing to gain access, then move around the\ncorporate network and potentially steal intellectual property as was the case with FireEye.\nThey will change techniques and tools, so you need to be ready. Our Advanced Threat\nResearch team tracks over 700 APT and Cyber Crime campaigns so the potential for\nanother threat actor to launch a similar attack is high. In this blog, we will take a specific look\nat the techniques used in the SolarWinds compromise and provide some guidance on how\nMcAfee solutions could help you respond now and prepare for this type of threat in the future\nwith an adaptable security capability for resilience.\n\n## Attack Chain Overview\n\nIn our [first blog in this series, we provided some initial response guidance designed to disrupt](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/sunburst-malware-and-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/)\nthe attack early in the Execution phase or look retrospectively on the endpoints or proxy logs\nfor indicators of compromise. But as you can see in the attack timeline below, it started much\nearlier with purposeful and detailed preparation and includes multiple other steps. A couple\nof techniques speak volumes about the sophistication and planning involved in this\ncampaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: SUNBURST Attack Progression\nFirst is the choice of entry vector. The attacker in this case compromised part of the software\nsupply chain by weaponizing software by SolarWinds, a major brand of IT management\nsoftware. While software supply chain compromises are not new, like the recent one affecting\n[JavaScript, they are typically on a smaller scale or more quickly detected. More common](https://www.zdnet.com/article/malicious-npm-packages-caught-installing-remote-access-trojans/)\ninitial access techniques involve Spearphishing or taking advantage of open remote services\n[like RDP. While both take planning and effort, weaponizing software from a major technology](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/cybercriminals-actively-exploiting-rdp-to-target-remote-organizations/)\ncompany and going undetected in that process is no easy feat. Secondly, the calculated wait\ntime before external communication and the custom Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)\nindicate the attacker has a lot of patience and stealth capability. For more detailed analysis of\nthese advanced techniques, see McAfee Labs additional analysis blog on the SUNBURST\nbackdoor.\n\nThe attack also involves numerous post-exploitation actions such as command and control\ncommunication masquerading (T1001.003) as normal update traffic, additional payload\ntransfers (T1105), system discovery, credential harvesting and potentially then movement to\nother systems, even cloud-hosted infrastructure systems. The goal of course is to disrupt or\ndetect any stage of attack before the breakout point and hopefully before any real impact to\nthe business. The breakout point is when an attacker has gained privileges and starts to\nmove laterally within the business. At that point, it becomes very difficult but not impossible to\ndisrupt or detect the activity. But you must act fast. The impact of the attack can vary. In one\ncase, it could be loss of intellectual property, but in another case, destruction of critical\nsystems or data could be the goal. Also, what if the attacker used other initial access\n[techniques, such as Spearphishing (T1566), to deliver a similar backdoor? Would you be](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)\nable to detect that activity or any of the follow actions? Our point is don’t just update the\n\n\n-----\n\nendpoint with the latest DAT and consider yourself secure. Look for other ways to disrupt or\ndetect an attack throughout the whole attack chain, leveraging both prevention and detection\ncapability and keeping the end goal in mind to reduce impact to the business. Also think\nabout how you prepare. The attackers in this case spent a lot of time in preparation creating\ncustom malware and infrastructure. How about your organization? Do you know what\nattackers might be targeting your organization? Do you know their tactics and techniques?\n\n## Staying Ahead with MVISION Insights\n\nIn the first hours of a new threat campaign, if the CIO or CISO asked you, “are we exposed\nto SUNBURST”, how long would it take you to answer that question? One place to turn is\n[MVISION Insights. MVISION Insights combines McAfee’s Threat Intelligence research with](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/mvision-insights.html)\ntelemetry from your endpoint controls to reduce your attack surface against emerging\nthreats. MVISION Insights tracks over 700 APT and Cyber Crime campaigns as researched\nby [McAfee’s ATR team, including the most recent, FireEye Red Team tool release and](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-center/advanced-threat-research.html)\nSolarWinds Supply Chain Compromise campaigns.\n\nFigure 2: Getting details on the attack\nIn the beginning hours of a new threat response, you can use MVISION Insights to get a\nquick summary of the threat, view external resources, and a list of known indicators such as\nfiles, URLs, or IP addresses. The campaign summary saves you from some of the timeconsuming task of combing multiple sites, downloading reports, and building out the broader\npicture. MVISION Insights provides critical pieces in one place allowing you to move quicker\nthrough the response process. The next question to answer, is this new attack a risk to my\nbusiness? Insights can help you answer that question as well when you click on “Your\nEnvironment”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Quick review of your exposure\nInsights automatically correlates the indicators of compromise with Threat Events from\nMcAfee ENS, allowing you to quickly asses if there is an immediate problem now. If you had\na detection, you should immediately go to incident response. Insights reviews your endpoint\ncontrol configuration to asses if you have the right content update deployed to potentially\ndisrupt the threat. At this point, you are closer to answer the CIO question of “are we\nexposed”. I say closer because Insights provides only the endpoint protection view currently\nso you will need to review other controls you have in place to fully assess risk.\n\nFigure 4: Detail review of your exposure\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, Insights also assesses your endpoint security posture against other advanced\nthreat techniques, looking to see if you are getting the best value from ENS by leveraging\nsignature, intelligence and behavior anomaly detection capability in the solution. This is\nimportant because the attackers will change tactics, using new entry techniques and tools,\nso your security posture must continuously adapt. And this is just one campaign. Insights is\nsummarizing intelligence, surfacing detections and reducing your attack surface\ncontinuously, against 700 campaigns!\n\n## Review your Defensive Architecture\n\nMitigating risk from SUNBURST and similar sophisticated APT campaigns requires a\nsecurity architecture that provides defense in depth and visibility throughout the entire attack\nchain. You should review your architecture and assess gaps either in technique visibility or\nprotection capability. Below we have outlined where McAfee and partner solutions could be\nused to either disrupt or detect some of the attack techniques used in SUNBURST based on\nwhat we know today.\n\nFigure 5: Device to Cloud Security Architecture\nWhile the attacker is no doubt sophisticated and stealthy, the multi-stage aspect of the attack\npresents opportunities to detect or stop at multiple points and perhaps even before the attack\ngains a foothold. We cover more about how to use McAfee EDR to search for or detect some\nof the techniques used in SUNBURST in next section. However, there are some other key\ncyber defense capabilities that may be overlooked in your organizations but are critical to\nhaving a chance at detection and mitigation. We highlight those in this section below.\n\n### Getting inside the attacker’s preparation\n\n\n-----\n\nNormally this is beyond what most organizations have time to do. However, in this case, you\nneed to gain any advantage. We discussed MVISION Insights above so here we will cover\nadditional guidance. During the preparation phase of this attack, the attacker obtains\ninfrastructure within the target geo to host their command and control server. During this\nphase, they also set the hostnames of their C2 servers to mimic target organization\nhostnames. A scan for your domain names on external IP blocks can reveal the attack\n[formation. Open source tools such as Spiderfoot offer a number of plugins to gather and](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot)\nanalyze such types of data. Passive DNS with combination of hosts communicating with\nunusual domain names also represent a window of detection whereby Advanced DNS\n[Protection solutions such as from our SIA partner Infoblox can detect behavior-based DGA](https://blogs.infoblox.com/security/how-behavioral-analytics-can-help-detect-0-day-threats/)\nusage by malware and automatically block such DNS resolution requests.\n\n### Visibility on DNS\n\nDNS queries often provide the first layers of insights into any type of C2 communication and\ndata exfiltration. You should enable logging ideally at an upstream resolver(s) where you can\nsee traffic from your entire infrastructure. More information can be found here for Windows\nDNS Servers and [Linux Bind DNS Servers. This could be forwarded to McAfee ESM/other](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01526)\nSIEMs for analysis and correlation for detection of DGA-type activities.\n\n### NetFlow Logging\n\nBeing able to detect unusual flows should also be a priority for incident responders. Along\nwith DNS queries, NetFlow data when combined with UBA provides a great source of\ndetection, as the attackers’ use of VPS providers can be combined with user login data to\ndetect an “impossible rate of travel event.”\n\n## Hunting for Indicators with MVISION EDR\n\n[As described in the defensive architecture, MVISION EDR plays a vital role in hunting for](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/mvision-edr.html)\nprevalence of indicators related to the SUNBURST backdoor and ensuing post compromise\nactivity. The role of MVISION EDR becomes even more important due to the usage of\nmanual OPSEC by the threat actor where what follows the initial breach is driven by how the\nthreat actor is targeting the organisation.\n\n### Hunting for Presence of Malicious Files\n\nYou can use MVISION EDR or MAR to search endpoints for SUNBURST indicators as\nprovided by Microsoft and FireEye. If you are licensed for MVISION Insights, you can pivot\ndirectly to MVISION EDR to search for indicators. MVISION EDR supports real-time\nsearches to hunt for presence of files on the endpoints and allows for sweeps across the\nestate. The following query can be used with the pre-populated malicious file hash list. The\n\n\n-----\n\npresence of the file on the system is itself does not mean it was successful and further\nhunting to check for execution of the actual malicious code on the system.is needed. See the\nsearch syntax below.\n\n**Begin MVEDR Query Syntax…**\n\nFiles name, full_name, md5, sha256, created_at, create_user_name, create_user_domain\nand HostInfo hostname, ip_address, os and LoggedInUsers username, userdomain where\nFiles sha256 equals\n“ac1b2b89e60707a20e9eb1ca480bc3410ead40643b386d624c5d21b47c02917c” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“c09040d35630d75dfef0f804f320f8b3d16a481071076918e9b236a321c1ea77” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“eb6fab5a2964c5817fb239a7a5079cabca0a00464fb3e07155f28b0a57a2c0ed” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“dab758bf98d9b36fa057a66cd0284737abf89857b73ca89280267ee7caf62f3b” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“32519685c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“d0d626deb3f9484e649294a8dfa814c5568f846d5aa02d4cdad5d041a29d5600” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“53f8dfc65169ccda021b72a62e0c22a4db7c4077f002fa742717d41b3c40f2c7” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“019085a76ba7126fff22770d71bd901c325fc68ac55aa743327984e89f4b0134” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“ce77d116a074dab7a22a0fd4f2c1ab475f16eec42e1ded3c0b0aa8211fe858d6” or Files\nsha256 equals\n“32519b85c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77” or Files\nsha256 equals “292327e5c94afa352cc5a02ca273df543f2020d0e76368ff96c84f4e90778712”\nor Files sha256 equals\n“c15abaf51e78ca56c0376522d699c978217bf041a3bd3c71d09193efa5717c71”\n\n**…End MVEDR Query Syntax**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Real Time Search for indicators\nAdditionally, you can do a historical search creation and deletion of files going back up to 90\ndays in cloud storage.\n\nFigure 7: Historical Search and Modification of Files\nThe threat actor is known to rename system utilities/files and clean up their tracks. MVISION\nEDR can review historical changes to the file system, this is crucial in determining if an\nendpoint was a victim of this attack. The flexible search interface can be used to filter down\nand track the progress of the completion of the attacker’s objectives for e.g. look at changes\ntriggered from the infected dll’s such as netsetupsvc.dll.\n\n### Hunting for Malicious Network Connections\n\nMVISION EDR allows for tracing of active network connections leveraging the real time\nsearch functionalities\n\nFigure 8: Realtime Network Connections\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can also leverage the historical search function to look for historical connections related\nto the command and control activity for this threat actor. The filtering by process ID and\nsource/destination IP allows analysts to track down the malicious communications.\n\nFigure 9: Historical Network Connections\nMVISION EDR also allows analysts to review historical DNS lookups thus allowing for the\nability to hunt for malicious DNS lookups. This is a very important capability in the product as\nmany organizations do not log DNS or have a DNS hierarchy that makes it harder to log the\nend device making the actual request.\n\nFigure 10: Historical DNS Searches\n\n\n-----\n\n### Hunting for Malicious Named Pipes Across the Estate\n\nMVISION EDR includes custom collector creation ability that allows for execution of custom\ncommands across the estate. In this case, it’s possible to look for the existence of the\nNamed Pipes by executing the following Powershell command:\n\nFigure 11: EDR Named Pipe Collector\nPowershell Command for Pipe detection [System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles(“\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\”) | %{($_ split “\\\\”)[6]}\n\nFigure 12: Realtime Search for Named Pipe\nHostInfo hostname, ip_address, os where _NamedPipe pipename contains “583da945-62af10e8-4902-a8f2 05c72b2e”\n\n### Hunting for Malicious Processes\n\nIt is known the attacker in its final stages leverages legitimate SolarWinds processes to\ncomplete their objectives:\n\n\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WerFault.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n\\SolarWinds\\Orion\\ExportToPDFCmd.Exe\n\n\\SolarWinds\\Orion\\APM\\APMServiceControl.exe\n\n\\SolarWinds.Credentials\\SolarWinds.Credentials.Orion.WebApi.exe\n\n\\SolarWinds\\Orion\\Topology\\SolarWinds.Orion.Topology.Calculator.exe\n\n\\SolarWinds\\Orion\\Database-Maint.exe\n\nProcessHistory parentname, name, id, cmdline WHERE ProcessHistory parentname equals\n“WerFault.exe” or ProcessHistory parentname equals “ExportToPDFCmd.Exe” or\nProcessHistory parentname equals “APMServiceControl.exe” or ProcessHistory parentname\nequals “SolarWinds.Credentials.Orion.WebApi.exe” or ProcessHistory parentname equals\n“SolarWinds.Orion.Topology.Calculator.exe” or ProcessHistory parentname equals\n“\\SolarWinds\\Orion\\Database-Maint.exe”\n\n### Hunting back longer than 90 days with EDR Trace Data\n\nMVISION EDR’s architecture leverages the Data Exchange Layer to stream trace data to our\ncloud service where we apply analytics to identify or investigate a threat. Trace data are\nartifacts from the endpoint, such as file hashes, processes, communications, typically\nneeded for endpoint detection and searches. The DXL architecture allows that data to be\nstreamed to the cloud as well to a local data store such as a SIEM or other log storage like\nElastic simultaneously.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14: Long term search of EDR trace data in a Kibana dashboard\n\nFigure 15: Long term search of EDR trace data in a Sp dashboard\nYou can store the data longer than the 90-day maximum McAfee stores in our cloud. Why is\nthis important? Recent analysis of SUNBURST suggests that the attack goes as far back as\nMarch 2020, and perhaps earlier. This local storage would provide capability to hunt for\nindicators further back as needed, if so configured.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Assessing Visibility\n\nHow do you know what data sources are needed to detect Mitre Att&ck tactics and\ntechniques? Carlos Diaz from MVISION EDR engineering wrote a great tool called Mitre[Assistant to simplify that process. You can download that tool here.](https://github.com/dfirence/mitre-assistant)\n\n## Detecting Actions on Objective\n\n### Post Initial Exploit Threat Detection and Analysis in EDR\n\nOne of the key challenges threat hunters and security analysts face is where the attack\nprogresses through to the second phase of the attack, where it is understood the attacker\nhas dropped malware to execute and complete their objectives. This usage of sophisticated\nexecution of malware from a trusted process is detected by MVISION EDR and automatically\nmapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. As part of the detection and process tracing,\nEDR also captures the command executed on the endpoint. This becomes invaluable in\ncase of tracking the manual OPSEC aspect of the second phase of the attack.\n\nFigure 16: Mitre analysis and threat detection for post exploit execution\nMVISION EDR provides extensive capabilities to respond to threats once they have been\nassessed, e.g. real-time searches once executed allows analysts to scope the affected\nendpoints rapidly at which point the solution offers multiple options as a method for\ncontainment and remediation of the threat across the estate through bulk operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17: EDR Bulk Threat Mitigation\n\n### Detecting Data Exfiltration, Lateral Movement and Prevention\n\nMVISION EDR provides a way to easily visualize data egress by looking at topology view of\nthe endpoints where malicious activity has been detected, by observing the network-flow\nmap the outlier connections can be easily identified and then correlated with WHOIS, IP\nreputation and Passive DNS data from providers like McAfee GTI and Virustotal. Once\nestablished, the external connections can be blocked and the endpoint can be quarantined\nfrom the EDR console. EDR also shows common processes spawning across multiple\nendpoints to showcase lateral movement and is also tagged as part of the MITRE techniques\nbeing identified and detected.\n\nFigure 18: EDR Lateral Movement and Exfiltration\n[Combining EDR with Deception technology such as that from Attivo Networks brings](https://attivonetworks.com/)\ntogether a combination of offensive detection where the attacker can be effectively trapped\nas result of not getting hold of the real credentials required to make the lateral movement/\nprivilege escalation a success thus failing in their objective completion.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn integrated approach to DLP can also provide effective protection against the completion\nof the objectives for e.g. unified DLP policy across the endpoint and web-gateway looking for\nexfiltration of sensitive organizational data can also provide valuable defenses. McAfee’s\nUCE platform provides such unified data protection capabilities.\n\n### Cloud account compromise detection\n\nOur latest research indicates attacker is actively looking to establish additional footholds into\ncustomer cloud environments such as Azure AD or bypass multi-factor authentication by\nhijacking SAML sessions, McAfee’s MVISION Cloud Access Control and User Anomaly\nDetection can identify suspicious access attempts to cloud services and infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is recommended to increase monitoring and investigations into such activity especially with\nprivileged accounts on sensitive infrastructure\n\n## Supply Chain and Intellectual Property Protection\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to architecture review and continuous hunting for indicators, it is recommended\nthat customers work with their suppliers – IT, Cloud Services, Infrastructure, Hardware, etc. –\nto validate integrity. Secondly, review controls, detection use cases in the SOC and logs,\nspecifically related to your intellectual property. A tabletop exercise to rehearse crisis\nmanagement and breach notification procedures is also recommended.\n\n## Summary and Next Steps\n\nIt’s important to note that analysis of this attack is ongoing across the globe and events are\nstill unfolding. The presence/detection of the backdoor and affected software is just the\nbeginning for many customers. MVISION EDR or other tool detections of malicious namedpipe presence and domains help indicate to a customer if the backdoor was running, but with\nthe gathered system information, the adversary may have valid accounts and access to AD\nor Cloud systems in some cases. The adversary has been wiping information/log files to\nerase traces. Incident Response is a critical piece of your overall business resilience and if\nyou are affected, you will no doubt be asking yourself these types of questions.\n\nWhen did we install the vulnerable software?\nDid they compromise user-accounts and have AD access?\nDid they install additional backdoors?\nHow many systems and accounts are affected?\nWere cloud or enterprise resources accessed?\nWas information stolen? If so, do we have notification procedures?\nAre there other supply chain compromises yet undiscovered?\n\nMcAfee will continue to post analysis results and defensive guidance as we learn more about\n[the attack.
