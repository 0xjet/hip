This visibility into all victims of the group (and\nnot only companies whose data was officially dumped on Avaddon’s shame blog)\nenabled unique insights into Avadon’s patterns, strategies, and methods.\n\nThrough investigating victimology, AdvIntel assessed that the total income made by\none operator through the year of Avaddon activities could potentially equal 1,000\nRussian median salaries which explains the foundation of ransonomics and why it\nattracts more and more talented individuals in Russia and other states.\n\nAccording to unique AdvIntel findings obtained through exhaustive investigations of the\nRussian-speaking underground cybercrime community, Avaddon demise was likely\ncaused by political reasons - a sharp reaction of the US presidential administration on\nthe recent ransomware attacks, and the subsequent pressure applied by Russian law\nenforcement against local cybercrime groups prior to the upcoming Bide-Putin summit.\n\n**_Introduction - The Lost Empire_**\n\nThe three-letter Hebrew root “avad” (אבד), from which the name is Avaddon derived, has two\nmain semantic interpretations- “to destroy” and “to lose / get lost”. Indeed, these two\nmeanings perfectly define the Avaddon ransomware - a destructive and malicious force which always managed to conceal itself and disappear.\n\nToday we shed light on this lost and hidden criminal empire using unique datasets - the full\nlist of Avaddon victims ever targeted by the group over the year of its existence - discovered\nby AdvIntel. This unique SIGINT data is supported by exclusive HUMINT findings statements made by the Eastern-European underground cybercommunity leaders who\nworked with Avaddon - explaining and interpreting the groups’ rapid rise and even more\nrapid downfall.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Avaddon & The Birth of “Ransonomics”_**\n\nOn June 11, 2021, Avaddon released keys for over 2,000 victims containing the exact\ncompany breach names.\n\nOur analysis of the confirmed victimology shows that some of them were the world’s leading\ncompanies. How did this group succeed in hitting so many companies within a year? The\nanswer is - Avaddon created an entire ecosystem around themselves - a web of supply\nchains, international affiliates, sellers, underground auction managers, and negotiators. They\nhave established an organic ecosystem of criminal extortion economy - a form of\n“ransonomics.”\n\nOf course, Avaddon was not the only group pursuing a diversified approach to building a\nlarger business system. However, they were likely the most creative ones. They were the\nonly Russian-speaking group that enabled but promoted international partners joining the\nteam as affiliates that directly represented the coverage of Avaddon’s attacks, reaching five\ncontinents.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Avaddon operations targeted companies and governments all across the globe, with the_\n_exception of Russia_\n\nOne of Avaddon’s largest attacks - on a major financial institution occurring in May 2021 illustrates this integrated approach of building the ransomware-attacks economy.\n\nAvaddon operations targeted companies and governments all across the globe, with\nthe exception of Russia\n\nWhile investigating the attack first, we discovered 141 unique indicators for RDP\n**compromises for the victim's domain. This means that Avaddon was using the services of**\nan RDP brute-forcing group. Moreover, two weeks before the attack, a threat actor\nconveniently published a post on a major underground forum where Avaddon was based,\nauctioning classified information on the future victim. This access seller happened to be\nconnected to a malware developer specializing in data exfiltration tools. In other words,\nbefore Avaddon performed their data-stealing operation, they were able to utilize the entirety\nof underground services and purchase the full set - RDP access, direct network access, and\nmalware for data exfiltration.\n\n**_Victimology - Key to Understanding the Adversary_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis innovative approach enabled Avaddon to perform several thousand attacks. AdvIntel\nhas analyzed Avaddon’s victim’s unique datasets to build the most definitive adversarial\nprofile.\n\nTraditionally, while profiling the group’s victimology, companies rely on the data available in\npublic - i.e. ransomware websites. And indeed, even looking at this partial data, which only\nincludes companies whose information was dumped on the shame blogs, we can see that\nAvaddon played a major role in the threat landscape.\n\n_Avaddon ransomware (in bright purple) per industry sector - data based on the publications_\n_by Avaddon group on the syndicate’s shame blog_\n\nHowever, the victims whose names were published on the shame blog are only the tip of the\niceberg. AdvIntel’s advanced dataset, covering all Avaddon victims, provides further\nvisibility into the gang’s operations.\n\nFor this statistical research, AdvIntel has selected a special high-value-target dataset. First,\nwe identified the industries which were the primary targets of the group - manufacturing,\nretail, technology, and engineering being the most preferred sectors most likely because, for\nthe companies in these sectors, even a brief interruption of businesses can imply fatal\nconsequences.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Avaddon ransomware victims defined by the industry of the victims (all-victims dataset)_\n\nFor the next step, we performed market research of the victims’ revenue to identify the\npotential pattern of Avaddon attacks.\n\nThe total revenue of all victims was around $35 Billion USD. This number is essentially the\nsegment of the market which has been in one way or another threatened by Avaddon\nmalicious operations.\n\nAvaddon’s victims can be divided into three categories - small, medium, and large.\n\nThe average victim revenue was:\n\n**$13 Million USD for small businesses**\n\n**$287 Million USD for medium-sized victims**\n\n**$3.7 Billion USD for larger businesses**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Avaddon ransomware victims by revenue_\n\n**_Ransonomics: Avaddon Ransomware Profits_**\n\nOur next research goal was to calculate how much money the Avaddon group could\n**make before their rapid retirement. We have utilized our previous knowledge from threat**\nactor engagements to develop realistic formulas of ransom demand calculations supported\nby the actual Avaddon cases.\n\nTraditionally, all Russian-speaking actors are using the victims’ annual revenue to calculate\nthe ransom. After identifying the revenue, they investigate the sector within which the victim\noperates. The most common calculation which according to our sensitive and credible\nsource intelligence as used by Avaddon was a so-called “5x5” rule when 5% of the annual\nrevenue is used to start the negotiations, with annual revenue estimated as one-fifth of the\ntotal revenue. In other words, for a victim which has a total revenue of $7 Million USD, the\nstarting ransom price will be $70,000 USD. Typically, Avaddon dropped the price during the\nbargaining, and the end ransom was around $50,000 USD for a successful operation.\n\nHowever, not all companies out of the two thousand victim list were forced to pay such\nransom. In many cases, the negotiation failed or the ransom was minimal - several thousand\nUSD (especially in the very beginning). At the same time, bigger payments were demanded\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom larger entities. Here, the 5x5 formula, however, was replaced by a more adequate\nscale for larger ransom involving 0,01% margins for annual revenue instead of 5%, etc. For a\nmulti-billion dollar company, the demand was constrained by a few million dollars.\n\n_In other words, in one year of ransomware development, an Avaddon member made_\n_the same amount of money as an average Russian would make in a millennium - the_\n_best illustration of how lucrative ransomware could be for the region._\n\nAfter finalizing all the calculations with a case-by-case study of each victim from the highvalue dataset, AdvIntel assessed that the bulk of ransom payments came from over a\nthousand smaller-sized companies, which were demanded between $30,000 to $70,000\nUSD and constituted the overall payment of $55 million to Avaddon. Over 500 larger\nbusinesses in the victim list constituted another $30 million, and the rest was divided\nbetween smaller payments. As such, our total assessment of Avaddon income is\napproximately $87 Million USD.\n\nOur team has also attempted to calculate the revenue of a core Avaddon team member\nbased on these numbers. Within Avaddon RaaS over 70% of income went to affiliates,\ntherefore, the core team, and especially the leader of Avaddon, received around $26 Million\nUSD. This number was likely divided between at least four individuals, which made the\napproximate annual income (Avaddon existed for a year) $7,000,000 USD. To compare - the\nmedian annual income in Russia is estimated at $7,000 USD.\n\nIn other words, in one year of ransomware development, an Avaddon member made the\nsame amount of money as an average Russian would make in a millennium - the best\nillustration of how lucrative ransomware could be for the region.\n\n**_Avaddon Downfall - Black Mark of Cyber Pirates_**\n\nIf Avaddon was so successful, what could have motivated them to quit? The likely answer is\nfear. The US law enforcement and the Biden administration became very upfront regarding\nfuture retaliatory measures against ransomware and the new angle in which ransomware is\nseen as essentially an act of terrorism. This new take on digital extortion from the world’s\nleading superpower had a direct response within the underground community - the abovementioned ransonomics - a carefully and meticulously built web of alliances and supply\nchains - started to rapidly fail.\n\n\n-----\n\nSoftware brokers refused to sell malware to ransomware groups, forums banned RaaS\npartnerships, and affiliates were left without means and services to disseminate the payload.\nThe cybercrime world was always similar to piracy and it has its own “black mark” - a\n**deadly stigma sign - after Colonial Pipeline, ransomware got this sign on itself. Avaddon,**\nwhich was in the center of the dynamic and turbulent ransomware ecosystem, quickly\nrealized the risks they may face.\n\n**When Politics Meets Cybercrime**\n\nThis realization was likely caused by the recent intervention of politics into the cybercrime\ndomain. Overall, the inner logic of the Russian security landscape presumes that a\nsuccessful cyber group will at some point become prominent enough to attract the state’s\nattention. Usually, law enforcement will turn a blind eye to cyber operations unless these\noperations target Russian citizens or businesses. However, this status quo has changed in\nMay 2021.\n\nAfter the admin of the largest XSS forum called for a ransomware ban justifying it for political\nreasons, the community of digital extortionists in Russia was observed to go through stages\nof paranoia. This was only supported by multiple statements made in the last three months\nby the Russian government, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by President Putin\npersonally about establishing an international Russian-American initiative to establish a\njoint cybersecurity landscape. The Russian officials likely see this as a tool of de-escalating\nthe US-Russian relationships, especially in the light of the upcoming Biden/Putin summit\nscheduled for June 16, 2021.\n\nIndeed, the Russian government traditionally goes through rounds of escalation and\ndeescalation with the West. The escalation phase involving military maneuvers in the\nproximity of the Russia-Ukraine border and in Northern Syria ended in April 2021. Now the\nKremlin aiming to address severe challenges of the post-covid economic recession and the\nturbulent domestic situation is interested in creating a certain framework of stability in the\ninternational arena and ensuring stabilized relationships with the US to avoid unnecessary\npressure. Cybersecurity - a controversial space or the Russia-US relationship is on the\nfrontlines of this de-escalation agenda.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is also noteworthy that some of the jurisdictions targeted by Avaddon - Iran, China, and\nTurkey have strong geopolitical ties with Russia and act as Russian allies or critical\neconomic partners. However, it is unclear if this could have led to any aggravation in the\nrelationship between Avaddon and the Russian state.\n\n_Usually, Russian security apparatus turns a blind eye to cyber operations unless these_\n_operations target Russian citizens or businesses. However, this status quo has_\n_changed in May 2021._\n\nWhatever the true rationale of the Russian politicians calling for international cybersecurity\ncooperation is, these recent statements have clearly had an impact on the underground\ncybercrime community. AdvIntel has tracked multiple discussions between top-tier actors\nworking with Avaddon who mentioned that one of the group’s affiliates was apprehended by\nthe Russian law enforcement on the eve of the US-Russia summit and that further arrests\nmay follow against the ransomware leaders in order to secure the political landscape.\n\n**Avaddon YARA Signature v1:**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule crime_win32_ransom_avaddon_1 {\nmeta:\ndescription = \"Detects Avaddon ransomware \"\nauthor = \"@VK_Intel\"\nreference = \"https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1300944441390370819\"\ntlp = \"white\"\ndate = \"2020-09-01\"\nstrings:\n     $str0 = \"rcid\"\n     $str1 = \"hdd\"\n     $str2 = \"lang\"\n     $cfg_parser = { 55 8b ec 6a ff 68 74 d8 46 00 64 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 50 81 ec 3c\n02 00 00 a1 ?? ?? ?? ?? 33 c5 89 ?? ?? 56 57 50 8d ?? ?? 64 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 8b f1 89\n?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ??\n?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7\n?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c6 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 8d ?? ?? ?? ??\n?? 8b ?? 51 8b ce ff ?? ?? 83 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 0f ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 8d ?? ?? ?? ?? ??\n8d ?? ?? e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? c6 ?? ?? ?? 8b ?? ?? 85 c0 0f ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? b9 10 00 00 00\nc7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 3b c1 c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c6 ?? ?? ?? 0f 42 c8 83 ?? ?? ?? 8d\n?? ?? 0f ?? ?? ?? 51 50 8d ?? ?? e8 ?? ?? ?? ?? c6 ?? ?? ?? 8b ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ??\n?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c6 ?? ?? ?? 83 f8 10 0f ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 c0 f0 b9 20 00\n00 00 3b c1 0f 42 c8 83 ?? ?? ?? 8d ?? ?? 0f ?? ?? ?? 51 83 c0 10 8d ?? ?? 50 e8 ??\n?? ?? ?? c6 ?? ?? ?? 83 ?? ?? ?? 0f ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 ?? ?? ?? 0f ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7\n?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??\n?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c6 ?? ?? ?? 8d ?? ??\n?? ?? ?? 8b ?? 51 8b ce ff ?? ?? 8b ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 8d ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? e8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n0f ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 0f ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? f3 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 66 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??\n?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??\n?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??}\n     $crypt_imp_seq = { 83 ?? ?? ?? 8b c7 c7 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 72 ?? 8b ?? 6a 00\n6a 00 8d ?? ?? 51 6a 00 6a 01 6a 00 50 ff ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 c0 74 ?? 56 8b ?? ?? ff\n?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 56 6a 00 50 ff ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 8b f0 85 f6 74 ?? 83 ?? ?? ?? 72 ?? 8b\n?? 6a 00 6a 00 8d ?? ?? 50 56 6a 01 6a 00 57 ff ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 c0 74 ?? 8b ?? ??\n8d ?? ?? 50 6a 00 6a 00 ff ?? ?? 56 ff ?? ?? ff ?? ?? ?? ?? ??}\ncondition:\n( uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and\n( 3 of them )\n) or ( all of them )\n}\n\n```\n**_Resource:_**\n\n**Avaddon Decryption Tool**\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/avaddon\n\n**_If you would like to learn more about how AdvIntel helps to make the world_**\n**_[ransomware-free, please contact us: info@advintel.tech](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:info@advintel.tech)_**\n\n**_Advanced Intelligence is an elite threat prevention firm.
