(https://cofenselabs.com/all-you-need-is-text/).\n\nOn Jun 11, 2020 we noticed an odd file extension show up in our analysis pipeline.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt was a jnlp file. The jnlp extension is short for “Java Network Launch Protocol” and is a\nfiletype used by Java with Java Web Start to load a java application. The file itself is a simple\nXML based format that is easily readable. This however did not stop this file type from\nevading a secure email gateway and finding its way in to a real estate industry mailbox.\n\nThe jnlp file format utilizes a similar URL building logic as we’ve seen in another technique\ndubbed ‘basestriker’ where by the primary domain and the path are separate entities. This\nmay be the reason that this file format was selected. Below is the text of one of those files:\n\nIf this file was clicked and the user had java installed a couple of things would happen:\n\n1) Java would load up the WHO website to make the user think the file is legitimate.\n\n2) Java will also load the domain plus the “map.jar” file as the path and pull down and\nexecute that jar file.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe analyzed this and found that once the jar file is loaded, it downloads an exe which further\nloads TrickBot. This can be seen in the following decompilation of that file:\n\n\n-----\n\nTraffic analysis of the infection chain confirmed our findings with typical C2 traffic that is seen\nfrom TrickBot, but with a gtag we have not seen before, chil.\n\nWhile TrickBot is not a new threat, this delivery chain is highly unusual. Leveraging the\ncoronavirus as a lure as well as an uncommon file type likely to evade secure email\ngateways for delivery, and it’s not hard to see how this could be a very effective campaign.\n\nMD5 (Application-Covid19.jnlp) = 51c0790a43c22efd4972b98283c45a98\n\nMD5 (SARS-2_Form.jnlp) = 51c0790a43c22efd4972b98283c45a98\n\nMD5 (map.exe) = dda70ed5f8e93b2456f593e8da46e464\n\nMD5 (map.jar) = a716ca7b680734cb0ea6fa479b4da7a7\n\nURL: https://mapcovid[.]net/map.jar\n\nURL: https://basecovid[.]com/map.exe\n\nC2: 134.119.191[.]12\n\n\n-----",
