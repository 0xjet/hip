This new case once again highlights the limits of\nGoogle’s [filters that are intended to prevent malware from slipping onto the Play Store. In this](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evbakk/fake-whatsapp-android-app-1-million-downloads)\ncase, more than 20 malicious apps went unnoticed by Google over the course of roughly two\nyears.\n\n\n-----\n\nMotherboard has also learned of a new kind of Android malware on the Google Play store\nthat was sold to the Italian government by a company that sells surveillance cameras but\nwas not known to produce malware until now. Experts told Motherboard the operation may\nhave ensnared innocent victims as the spyware appears to have been faulty and poorly\ntargeted. Legal and law enforcement experts told Motherboard the spyware could be illegal.\n\n“These apps would remain available on the Play Store for months and would\neventually be re-uploaded.”\n\nThe spyware apps were discovered and studied in a joint investigation by researchers from\n[Security Without Borders, a non-profit that often](https://securitywithoutborders.org/) investigates threats against dissidents and\nhuman rights defenders, and Motherboard. The researchers published a detailed, technical\nreport of their findings on Friday.\n\n“We identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on Google\nPlay Store multiple times over the course of over two years. These apps would remain\navailable on the Play Store for months and would eventually be re-uploaded,” the\n[researchers wrote.](https://securitywithoutborders.org/blog/2019/03/29/exodus.html)\n\nLukas Stefanko, a researcher at security firm ESET, who specializes in Android malware but\nwas not involved in the Security Without Borders research, told Motherboard that it’s\nalarming, but not surprising, that malware continues to make its way past the Google Play\nStore’s filters.\n\n“Malware in 2018 and even in 2019 has successfully penetrated Google Play’s security\nmechanisms. Some improvements are necessary,” Stefanko said in an online chat. “Google\nis not a security company, maybe they should focus more on that.”\n\n## MEET EXODUS\n\nIn an apparent attempt to trick targets to install them, the spyware apps were designed to\nlook like harmless apps to receive promotions and marketing offers from local Italian\ncellphone providers, or to improve the device’s performance.\n\nA screenshot of one of the malicious apps. (Image: Security Without Borders)\n\nThe researchers alerted Google earlier this year to the existence of the apps, which were\nthen taken down. Google told the researchers and Motherboard, that it found a total of 25\ndifferent versions of the spyware over the last two years, dating back to 2016. Google\ndeclined to share the exact numbers of victims, but said it was below 1,000, and that all of\nthem were in Italy. The company would not provide more information about the targets.\n\nThe researchers are calling the malware Exodus, after the name of the command and control\nservers the apps connected to. A person who’s familiar with the malware development\nconfirmed to Motherboard that was the internal name of the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nExodus was programmed to act in two stages. In the first stage, the spyware installs itself\nand only checks the phone number and its IMEI—the device’s unique identifying number—\npresumably to check whether the phone was intended to be targeted. For that apparent\npurpose, the malware has a function called “CheckValidTarget.”\n\nBut, in fact, the spyware does not appear to properly check, according to the researchers.\nThis is important because there are currently some legally permissible uses of narrowly\ntargeted malware—for example, with a court order, law enforcement can legally hack devices\nin many countries.\n\nIn a test done on a burner phone, the researchers saw that after running the check, the\nmalware downloaded a ZIP file to install the actual malware, which hacks the phone and\nsteals data from it.\n\n“This suggests that the operators of the Command & Control are not enforcing a proper\n[validation of the targets,” Security Without Borders concluded in the report. “Additionally,](https://securitywithoutborders.org/blog/2019/03/29/exodus.html)\nduring a period of several days, our infected test devices were never remotely disinfected by\nthe operators.”\n\n**_Got a tip?

And you can reach Riccardo Coluccini securely on_**\n**_OTR chat at rcoluc@jabber.ccc.de, and riccardo.coluccini@vice.com._**\n\nAt that point, the malware has access to most of the sensitive data on the infected phone,\nsuch as audio recordings of the phone’s surroundings, phone calls, browsing history,\ncalendar information, geolocation, Facebook Messenger logs, WhatsApp chats, and text\n\n\n-----\n\nmessages, among other data, according to the researchers.\n\nThe spyware also opens up a port and a shell on the device, meaning it allows the operators\nto send commands to the infected phone. According to the researchers, this shell is not\nprogrammed to use encryption, and the port is open to anyone on the same Wi-Fi network as\nthe target. This means that anyone in the vicinity could hack the infected device, according to\nthe researchers.\n\n“This inevitably leaves the device open not only for further compromise but for data\ntampering as well,” the researchers wrote.\n\nA second, independent analysis by Trail of Bits, a New York-based cybersecurity company\nthat looked into the malware for Motherboard, confirmed that the malware samples all\nconnect to the servers of one company, that the IP addresses identified by Security Without\nBorders are all connected, and that the malware leaves the target device more vulnerable to\nhacking.\n\n**WHO IS BEHIND THE SPYWARE?**\n\nAll the evidence collected by Security Without Borders in its investigation indicates the\n[malware was developed by eSurv, an Italian company based in the southern city of](https://web.archive.org/web/20190114193603/http://www.esurv.it/)\nCatanzaro, in the Calabria region.\n\nThe first hint that the authors of the malware were italian came from two strings inside the\nmalware code: “mundizza,” and “RINO GATTUSO.” [Mundizza is a dialectal word from the](https://www.dialettando.com/dizionario/detail.lasso?id=8012)\n[southern region of calabria that loosely translates to garbage. Rino Gattuso is a famous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennaro_Gattuso)\nretired Italian footballer from Calabria.\n\nThe real smoking gun, however, is the command and control server used in several of the\napps found on the Play Store to send the data back to the malware operators.\n\nThe server, according to the researchers, shares a TLS web encryption certificate with other\nservers that belong to eSurv’s surveillance camera service, which is the company’s main\npublic business. Also, some of these servers identified by the researchers display eSurv’s\nlogo as the icon associated with the server’s address, the icon you can see in your browser’s\ntab, also known as favicon.\n\nOther spyware samples communicate with a server belonging to eSurv, according to the\nresearchers. Google confirmed the servers belong to eSurv. The Trail of Bits researcher who\nreviewed the technical report and the spyware confirmed that it’s linked to eSurv.\n\nA sample of eSurv's command and control servers. (Image: Security Without Borders)\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, an eSurv employee explained in a resume publicly available through his LinkedIn\npage that as part of his job at the company, he developed “an ‘agent’ application to gather\ndata from Android devices and send it to a C&C server”—a technical, albeit clear, reference\nto Android spyware.\n\nMotherboard reached out to the developer, who declined to comment, arguing that the\nanswer would be “confidential information. I don’t think I can say anything about this ;)”\n\nWe reached out to eSurv multiple times via email and LinkedIn. Initially, an employee of the\ncompany claimed to be surprised and shocked by our findings, given that eSurv only sells\nvideo surveillance, she said. A few hours after our phone call, the company took down its site\nfor a couple of weeks.\n\nAfter we followed up and asked for clarification, the company declined to comment.\n\neSurv appears to have an ongoing relationship with Italian law enforcement, though Security\nWithout Borders was unable to confirm whether the malicious apps were developed for\ngovernment customers.\n\neSurv won an Italian government State Police tender for the development of a “passive and\n[active interception system,” according to a document published online in compliance with the](https://www.poliziadistato.it/statics/21/serv-econ-fin-pagamenti3-1-.pdf)\nItalian government spending transparency law. The document reveals that eSurv received a\npayment of € 307,439.90 on November 6, 2017.\n\n[We filed a freedom of information request to obtain information on the tender, the list of](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5753301-FOI-Request-to-Italian-Interior-Ministry.html)\ncompanies that participated, the technical offer sent by the company, and the invoices issued\nby eSurv. Our request, however, was rejected. The Anti-Drug Police Directorate, an agency\nwithin the State Police which responded to the request, said it could not respond with the\ndocuments because the surveillance system was obtained with “special security measures.”\n\nOver the last few months, several sources with knowledge of Italy’s spyware market told\nMotherboard that a new company from Calabria was getting several contracts to develop\nsurveillance software with law enforcement and government agencies. Some of those\nsources specifically named eSurv as that new company that was taking the local market by\nstorm.\n\nFinally, a source close to eSurv, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not\nauthorized to speak to the press, said that the company sells malware to the Italian police.\n\n“They publish [the spyware] on the Play Store and then induce the person to download it and\nopen it,” the source said in an online chat.\n\n## IS THIS ALL LEGAL?\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing spyware with warrants or a judge s authorization is, generally speaking, legal in most\ncountries in Europe, as well as the United States. In this case, however, eSurv’s spyware\nmay not be operating according to the law, experts told Motherboard.\n\n“I don’t think there are reasons to believe this spyware is legal,” Giuseppe Vaciago, an Italian\nlawyer who specializes in criminal law and surveillance, told Motherboard after reviewing the\nreport by Security Without Borders.\n\nVaciago explained that a spyware acting according to Italian law should not install itself on\nany target without first validating that the target is legitimate, something Exodus does not\nproperly do, according to the researchers.\n\nMoreover, Vaciago explained that Italian law effectively equates spyware with physical\nsurveillance devices, such as old school hidden microphones and cameras, limiting its uses\nto capturing audio and video.\n\n“This software, on the other hand, is able to do, and effectively appears to have done, much\nmore invasive activities than those prescribed by the law,” Vaciago told Motherboard in an\nemail.\n\n“Opening up security holes and leaving them available to anyone is crazy and\nsenseless, even before being illegal.”\n\nThe fact that the malware leaves the device vulnerable to other hackers is perhaps the worst\nelement of Exodus, according to a police agent who has experience using spyware during\ninvestigations, and who asked to remain anonymous because he’s not allowed to speak to\nthe press.\n\n“This, from the point of view of legal surveillance, is insane,” the agent told Motherboard.\n“Opening up security holes and leaving them available to anyone is crazy and senseless,\neven before being illegal.”\n\nAt the end of 2017, Italy [introduced a law regulating the use of spyware for law enforcement](https://motherboard.vice.com/it/article/7xedna/la-legge-italiana-sulluso-dei-trojan-e-un-disastro)\nactivities and investigations—the law only regulates the use of spyware to record audio\nremotely, leaving out all the other features that surveillance software can have, such as\nintercepting text messages, or taking screenshots of the screen. In May 2018, the Ministry of\nJustice [published technical requirements that must be respected in the development and use](http://www.bv.ipzs.it/bv-pdf/003/MOD-BP-18-071-107_2302_1.pdf)\nof spyware by law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn an [opinion issued by the Italian Data Protection Authority in April of last year, the authority](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/8987309)\ncriticized the requirements for being too vague when it came to describing the interception\nsystem’s components, and it emphasized that authorities need to ensure that installing the\nspyware on a target does not reduce the overall security of the infected device.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is in order to prevent the device from being compromised by third parties, avoiding\nnegative consequences on the protection of personal data contained therein as well as on\ninvestigative activities,” the authority wrote.\n\nApps that offer promotions and marketing offers from local telecommunication providers is a\n[front that has been used by Italian government malware before. In fact, Italian](https://motherboard.vice.com/it/article/9k89j3/ecco-il-listino-prezzi-della-polizia-italiana-per-la-sorveglianza-telefonica)\ntelecommunication companies can be forced by the government to send text messages to\n[facilitate malware injection on suspects’ devices, as previously reported by Motherboard Italy.](https://motherboard.vice.com/it/article/9k89j3/ecco-il-listino-prezzi-della-polizia-italiana-per-la-sorveglianza-telefonica)\n\nDetails of this activity were found in a hearing of the Company Security Governance of the\nItalian cellphone provider Wind Tre Spa, held in March of 2017 by the Parliamentary\nCommittee for the Security of the Republic (COPASIR)—a committee that supervises the\nactivity of the intelligence services.\n\nAccording to the document, which summarizes the hearings, when it comes to the use of\nspyware for investigations, the telecommunication operators are consulted to facilitate the\ninfection of third party devices with the malware. These operations “consist mainly in\nexpanding the bandwidth and sending messages to request certain maintenance activities,”\nthe document reads. These activities may be included in what are called “mandatory justice\n[services” for telecommunication operators, services that are detailed in a specific price list by](https://www.giustizia.it/resources/cms/documents/dag_decreto_28dic2017_tabella_listino.pdf)\nthe Ministry of Justice: ranging from 15 Euros for wiretaps and internet communication flow,\nto 110 Euros for “assistance and feasibility studies.”\n\nAt the time of publication, the Italian State Police did not respond to multiple requests for\ncomment on the technology subject to their tender, nor they had replied to questions on the\nuse of this spyware. Questions to two Italian Public Prosecutor's Offices went unanswered as\nwell.\n\nThe police agent agreed that eSurv’s spyware lacked the right scope and safeguards to\nensure it wouldn’t hit people who were not being under investigation.\n\n“You can’t do something indiscriminate,” the police agent told Motherboard. “Putting\nsomething on the Play Store thinking you’re going to infect an undetermined number of\npeople, and do trawling is something absolutely illegal.”\n\nThe source close to eSurv confirmed that, at times, the apps ended up on the wrong phones,\nas “oblivious people,” the source said, “unknowingly downloaded the app and infected\nthemselves.”\n\nInstead of doing anything to stop that, however, the company used the victims as “guinea\npigs.”\n\n**_[Listen to CYBER, Motherboard’s new weekly podcast about hacking and](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2)_**\n**_cybersecurity._**\n\n\n-----\n\n### ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
