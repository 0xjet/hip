The attackers behind Epic Turla have\ninfected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries, including government\ninstitutions, embassies, military, education, research and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe attacks are known to have used at least two zero-day exploits:\n\n**[CVE-2013-5065 – Privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows XP and Windows 2003](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-5065)**\n**[CVE-2013-3346 – Arbitrary code-execution vulnerability in Adobe Reader](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-3346)**\n\nWe also observed exploits against older (patched) vulnerabilities, social engineering\ntechniques and watering hole strategies in these attacks. The primary backdoor used in the\nEpic attacks is also known as “WorldCupSec”, “TadjMakhal”, “Wipbot” or “Tavdig”.\n\n[When G-Data published on Turla/Uroburos back in February, several questions remained](https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/uroburos-highly-complex-espionage-software-with-russian-roots.html)\nunanswered. One big unknown was the infection vector for Turla (aka Snake or Uroburos).\nOur analysis indicates that victims are infected via a sophisticated multi-stage attack, which\nbegins with the Epic Turla. In time, as the attackers gain confidence, this is upgraded to more\n\n\n-----\n\nsophisticated backdoors, such as the Carbon/Cobra system. Sometimes, both backdoors are\nrun in tandem, and used to “rescue” each other if communications are lost with one of the\nbackdoors.\n\nOnce the attackers obtain the necessary credentials without the victim noticing, they deploy\nthe rootkit and other extreme persistence mechanisms.\n\nThe attacks are still ongoing as of July 2014, actively targeting users in Europe and the\nMiddle East.\n\n**_Note: A full analysis of the Epic attacks is available to the Kaspersky Intelligent_**\n**_[Services subscribers. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)_**\n\n## The Epic Turla attacks\n\nThe attacks in this campaign fall into several different categories depending on the vector\nused in the initial compromise:\n\nSpearphishing e-mails with Adobe PDF exploits (CVE-2013-3346 + CVE-2013-5065)\nSocial engineering to trick the user into running malware installers with “.SCR”\nextension, sometimes packed with RAR\nWatering hole attacks using Java exploits (CVE-2012-1723), Flash exploits (unknown)\nor Internet Explorer 6,7,8 exploits (unknown)\nWatering hole attacks that rely on social engineering to trick the user into running fake\n“Flash Player” malware installers\n\nThe attackers use both direct spearphishing and watering hole attacks to infect their victims.\nWatering holes (waterholes) are websites of interest to the victims that have been\ncompromised by the attackers and injected to serve malicious code.\n\nSo far we haven’t been able to locate any e-mail used against the victims, only the\nattachments. The PDF attachments do not show any “lure” to the victim when opened,\nhowever, the SCR packages sometime show a clean PDF upon successful installation.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of known attachment names used in the spearphishing attacks are:\n\n**ؤﺗﻤﺮ ﺟﻨﯿﻒ.rar (translation from Arabic: “Geneva conference.rar”)**\n**NATO position on Syria.scr**\n**Note_№107-41D.pdf**\n**Talking Points.scr**\n**border_security_protocol.rar**\n**Security protocol.scr**\n**Program.scr**\n\nIn some cases, these filenames can provide clues about the type of victims the attackers are\ntargeting.\n\n## The watering hole attacks\n\nCurrently, the Epic attackers run a vast network of watering holes that target visitors with\nsurgical precision.\n\nSome of the injected websites include:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The website of the City Hall of Pinor, Spain_\n\n_A site promoting entrepreneurship in the border area of Romania_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Palestinian Authority Ministry of Foreign Affairs_\n\nIn total, we observed more than 100 injected websites. Currently, the largest number of\ninjected sites is in Romania.\n\nHere’s a statistic on the injected websites:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe distribution is obviously not random, and it reflects some of the interests of the attackers.\nFor instance, in Romania many of the infected sites are in the Mures region, while many of\nthe Spanish infected sites belong to local governments (City Hall).\n\nMost of the infected sites use the TYPO3 CMS (see: [https://typo3.org/), which could indicate](https://typo3.org/)\nthe attackers are abusing a specific vulnerability in this publishing platform.\n\nInjected websites load a remote JavaScript into the victim’s browser:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script “sitenavigatoin.js” is a Pinlady-style browser and plugin detection script, which in\nturn, redirects to a PHP script sometimes called main.php or wreq.php. Sometimes, the\nattackers register the .JPG extension with the PHP handler on the server, using “JPG” files to\nrun PHP scripts:\n\n_Profiling script_\n\nThe main exploitation script “wreq.php”, “main.php” or “main.jpg” performs a numbers of\ntasks. We have located several versions of this script which attempt various exploitation\nmechanisms.\n\nOne version of this script attempts to exploit Internet Explorer versions 6, 7 and 8:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Internet Explorer exploitation script_\n\nUnfortunately, the Internet Explorer exploits have not yet been retrieved.\n\nAnother more recent version attempts to exploit Oracle Sun Java and Adobe Flash Player:\n\n_Java and Flash Player exploitation scripts_\n\nAlthough the Flash Player exploits couldn’t be retrieved, we did manage to obtain the Java\nexploits:\n\n**Name** **MD5**\n\nallj.html 536eca0defc14eff0a38b64c74e03c79\n\nallj.jar f41077c4734ef27dec41c89223136cf8\n\nallj64.html 15060a4b998d8e288589d31ccd230f86\n\nallj64.jar e481f5ea90d684e5986e70e6338539b4\n\nlstj.jar 21cbc17b28126b88b954b3b123958b46\n\n\n-----\n\nlstj.html acae4a875cd160c015adfdea57bd62c4\n\nThe Java files exploit a popular vulnerability, [CVE-2012-1723, in various configurations.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-1723)\n\nThe payload dropped by these Java exploits is the following:\n\n**MD5: d7ca9cf72753df7392bfeea834bcf992**\n\nThe Java exploit use a special loader that attempts to inject the final Epic backdoor payload\ninto explorer.exe. The backdoor extracted from the Java exploits has the following C&C\nhardcoded inside:\n\n**www.arshinmalalan[.]com/themes/v6/templates/css/in.php**\n\nThis C&C is still online at the moment although it redirects to a currently suspended page at\n“hxxp://busandcoachdirectory.com[.]au“. For a full list of C&C servers, please see the\n[Appendix.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08080105/KL_Epic_Turla_Technical_Appendix_20140806.pdf)\n\nThe Epic Turla attackers are extremely dynamic in using exploits or different methods\ndepending on what is available at the moment. Most recently, we observed them using yet\nanother technique coupled with watering hole attacks. This takes advantage of social\nengineering to trick the user into running a fake Flash Player (MD5:\n030f5fdb78bfc1ce7b459d3cc2cf1877):\n\n\n-----\n\nIn at least one case, they tried to trick the user into downloading and running a fake Microsoft\nSecurity Essentials app (MD5: 89b0f1a3a667e5cd43f5670e12dba411):\n\nThe fake application is signed by a valid digital certificate from Sysprint AG:\n\nSerial number: 00 c0 a3 9e 33 ec 8b ea 47 72 de 4b dc b7 49 bb 95\nThumbprint: 24 21 58 64 f1 28 97 2b 26 22 17 2d ee 62 82 46 07 99 ca 46\n\n_Valid signature from Sysprint AG on Epic dropper_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis file was distributed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan s website, at\n“hxxp://mfa[.]tj/upload/security.php“.\n\nThe file is a .NET application that contains an encrypted resource. This drops the malicious\nfile with the MD5 7731d42b043865559258464fe1c98513.\n\nThis is an Epic backdoor which connects to the following C&Cs, with a generic internal ID of\n**1156fd22-3443-4344-c4ffff:**\n\n**hxxp://homaxcompany[.]com/components/com_sitemap/**\n**hxxp://www.hadilotfi[.]com/wp-content/themes/profile/**\n\nA full list with all the C&C server URLs that we recovered from the samples can be found in\n[the technical Appendix.](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/08080105/KL_Epic_Turla_Technical_Appendix_20140806.pdf)\n\n## The Epic command-and-control infrastructure\n\nThe Epic backdoors are commanded by a huge network of hacked servers that deliver\ncommand and control functionality.\n\nThe huge network commanded by the Epic Turla attackers serves multiple purposes. For\ninstance, the motherships function as both exploitation sites and command and control\npanels for the malware.\n\nHere’s how the big picture looks like:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Epic Turla lifecycle_\n\nThe first level of command and control proxies generally talk to a second level of proxies,\nwhich in turn, talk to the “mothership” server. The mothership server is generally a VPS,\nwhich runs the Control panel software used to interact with the victims. The attackers\noperate the mothership using a network of proxies and VPN servers for anonymity reasons.\nThe mothership also work as the exploitation servers used in the watering hole attacks,\ndelivering Java, IE or fake applications to the victim.\n\nWe were able to get a copy of one of the motherships, which provided some insight into the\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt runs a control panel which is password protected:\n\n_Epic mothership control panel login_\n\nOnce logged into the Control panel, the attackers can see a general overview of the system\nincluding the number of interesting potential targets:\n\n_Epic control panel status overview_\n\nA very interesting file on the servers is task.css, where the attackers define the IP ranges\nthey are interested in. To change the file, they are using the “Task editor” from the menu.\nDepending on the “tasks”, they will decide whether to infect the visitors or not. In this case,\nwe found they targeted two ranges belonging to:\n\n“Country A” – Federal Government Network\n“Country B” – Government Telecommunications and Informatics Services Network\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be noted though, the fact that the attackers were targeting these ranges doesn t\nnecessarily mean they also got infected. Some other unknown IPs were also observed in the\ntargeting schedules.\n\nThere is also an “except.css” file where attackers log the reasons they didn’t try to exploit\ncertain visitors. There are three possible values:\n\nTRY\nDON’T TRY -> Version of the browser and OS does not meet the conditions\nDON’T TRY -> (2012-09-19 10:02:04) – checktime < 60\n\nThese are the “don’t meet the conditions” reasons observed in the logs:\n\nWindows 7 or 2008 R2\nMSIE 8.0\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2;\n.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322;\n.NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\nAdobe Shockwave 11.5.1.601\nAdobe Flash 10.3.181.14\nAdobe Reader 10.1.0.0\nWin Media Player 12.0.7601.17514\nQuick Time null\nMS Word null\nJava null\n\n## The Epic / Tavdig / Wipbot backdoor\n\nFor this first stage of the attack, the threat actor uses a custom backdoor. In some cases, the\nbackdoor is packaged together with the CVE-2013-5065 EoP exploit and heavily obfuscated.\nThis makes the analysis more difficult.\n\nThe CVE-2013-5065 exploit allows the backdoor to achieve administrator privileges on the\nsystem and run unrestricted. This exploit only works on unpatched Microsoft Windows XP\nsystems.\n\nOther known detection names for the backdoor is Trojan.Wipbot (Symantec) or Tavdig.\n\nThe main backdoor is about 60KB in size and implements a C&C protocol on top of normal\nHTTP requests. The communication protocol uses requests in the C&C\nreplies, which the malware decrypts and processes. The replies are sent back to the C&C\nthrough the same channel.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware behavior is defined by a configuration block. The configuration block usually\ncontains two hard-coded C&C URLs. He have also seen one case where the configuration\nblock contains just one URL. The configuration can also be updated on the fly by the\nattackers, via the C&C.\n\nThe backdoor attempts to identify the following processes and, if found, it will terminate itself:\n\ntcpdump.exe\nwindump.exe\nethereal.exe\nwireshark.exe\nettercap.exe\nsnoop.exe\ndsniff.exe\n\nIt contains an internal unique ID, which is used to identify the victim to the C&C. Most\nsamples, especially old ones, have the ID 1156fd22-3443-4344-c4ffff. Once a victim is\nconfirmed as “interesting”, the attackers upload another Epic backdoor which has a unique\nID used to control this specific victim.\n\nDuring the first C&C call, the backdoor sends a pack with the victim’s system information. All\nfurther information sent to the C&C is encrypted with a public key framework, making\ndecryption impossible. The commands from the C&C are encrypted in a simpler manner and\ncan be decrypted if intercepted because the secret key is hardcoded in the malware.\n\nThrough monitoring, we were able to capture a large amount of commands sent to the\nvictims by the attackers, providing an unique view into this operation. Here’s a look at one of\nthe encrypted server replies:\n\nOnce a victim is infected and “checks in” with the server, the attackers send a template of\ncommands:\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the attackers try to move through the victim’s network using pre-defined or collected\npasswords:\n\nListing all .doc files recursively is also a common “theme”:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn total, we have decoded several hundreds of these command packages delivered to the\nvictims, providing an unique insight into the inner workings of the attackers.\n\nIn addition to generic searches, some very specific lookups have been observed as well.\nThese include searches for:\n\n***NATO*.msg**\n**eu energy dialogue*.***\n**EU*.msg**\n**Budapest*.msg**\n\nIn this case, the attackers were interested to find e-mails related to “NATO”, “Energy\nDialogue within European Union” and so on.\n\nFor some of the C&C servers, the attackers implemented RSA encryption for the C&C logs,\nwhich makes it impossible to decrypt them. This scheme was implemented in April 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lateral movement and upgrade to more sophisticated backdoors\n\nOnce a victim is compromised, the attackers upload several tools that are used for lateral\nmovement.\n\nOne such tool observed in the attacks and saved as “C:Documents and SettingsAll\n**usersStart MenuProgramsStartupwinsvclg.exe” is:**\n\n**Name: winsvclg.exe**\n\n**MD5: a3cbf6179d437909eb532b7319b3dafe**\n\n**Compiled: Tue Oct 02 13:51:50 2012**\n\nThis is a keylogger tool that creates %temp%~DFD3O8.tmp. Note: the filename can change\nacross victims. On one Central Asian government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs victim system,\nthe filename used was “adobe32updt.exe“.\n\nIn addition to these custom tools, we observed the usage of standard administration utilities.\nFor instance, another tool often uploaded by the attackers to the victim’s machine is\n“winrs.exe”:\n\n**Name: winrs.exe**\n\n**MD5: 1369fee289fe7798a02cde100a5e91d8**\n\nThis is an UPX packed binary, which contains the genuine “dnsquery.exe” tool from\nMicrosoft, unpacked MD5: c0c03b71684eb0545ef9182f5f9928ca.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn several cases, an interesting update has been observed — a malware from a different,\nyet related family.\n\n**Size: 275,968 bytes**\n**MD5: e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f**\n**Compiled: Thu Nov 08 11:05:35 2012**\n\nanother example:\n\n**Size: 218,112 bytes**\n**MD5: 071d3b60ebec2095165b6879e41211f2**\n**Compiled: Thu Nov 08 11:04:39 2012**\n\nThis backdoor is more sophisticated and belongs to the next level of cyber-espionage tools\ncalled the “Carbon system” or Cobra by the Turla attackers. Several plugins for the “Carbon\nsystem” are known to exist.\n\n_Decoded configuration for e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f_\n\nNote: the command and control servers www.losguayaberos[.]com and\n**thebesttothbrushes[.]com have been sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab.**\n\nOther packages delivered to the victims include:\n\n**MD5: c7617251d523f3bc4189d53df1985ca9**\n**MD5: 0f76ef2e6572befdc2ca1ca2ab15e5a1**\n\nThese top level packages deploy both updated Epic backdoors and Turla Carbon system\nbackdoors to confirmed victims, effectively linking the Epic and Turla Carbon operations\ntogether.\n\nThe Turla Carbon dropper from these packages has the following properties:\n\n**MD5: cb1b68d9971c2353c2d6a8119c49b51f**\n\nThis is called internally by the authors “Carbon System”, part of the “Cobra” project, as it can\nbe seen from the debug path inside:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis acts as a dropper for the following modules, both 32 and 64 bit:\n\n**MD5** **Resource number**\n\n4c1017de62ea4788c7c8058a8f825a2d 101\n\n43e896ede6fe025ee90f7f27c6d376a4 102\n\ne6d1dcc6c2601e592f2b03f35b06fa8f 104\n\n554450c1ecb925693fedbb9e56702646 105\n\ndf230db9bddf200b24d8744ad84d80e8 161\n\n91a5594343b47462ebd6266a9c40abbe 162\n\n244505129d96be57134cb00f27d4359c 164\n\n4ae7e6011b550372d2a73ab3b4d67096 165\n\nThe Carbon system is in essence an extensible platform, very similar to other attack\n[platforms such as the Tilded platform or the](https://securelist.com/stuxnetduqu-the-evolution-of-drivers/36462/) [Flame platform. The plugins for the Carbon](https://securelist.com/full-analysis-of-flames-command-control-servers/34216/)\nsystem can be easily recognized as they always feature at least two exports named:\n\nModuleStart\nModuleStop\n\n_Carbon system plugin with characteristic exports_\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral Epic backdoors appear to have been designed to work as Carbon system plugins as\nwell – they require a specialized loader to start in victim systems that do not have the Carbon\nsystem deployed.\n\nSome modules have artifacts which indicate the Carbon system is already at version 3.x,\nalthough the exact Carbon system version is very rarely seen in samples:\n\nThe author of the Carbon module above can be also seen in the code, as “gilg”, which also\nauthored several other Turla modules.\n\nWe are planning to cover the Turla Carbon system with more details in a future report.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Language artifacts\n\nThe payload recovered from one of the mothership servers (at\n**newsforum.servehttp[.]com/wordpress/wp-includes/css/img/upload.php, MD5:**\n**4dc22c1695d1f275c3b6e503a1b171f5, Compiled: Thu Sep 06 14:09:55 2012) contains two**\nmodules, a loader/injector and a backdoor. Internally, the backdoor is named\n“Zagruzchik.dll”:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe word “Zagruzchik” means “boot loader” in Russian.\n\nThe Control panel for the Epic motherships also sets the language to codepage “1251”:\n\nCodepage 1251 is commonly used to render Cyrillic characters.\n\nThere are other indications that the attackers are not native English language speakers:\n\n_Password it´s wrong!_\n_Count successful more MAX_\n_File is not exists_\n_File is exists for edit_\n\nThe sample e9580b6b13822090db018c320e80865f that was delivered to several Epic\nvictims as an upgraded backdoor, has the compilation code page language set to\n“LANG_RUSSIAN”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actor behind the “Epic” operation uses mainly hacked servers to host their\nproxies. The hacked servers are controlled through the use of a PHP webshell. This shell is\npassword protected; the password is checked against an MD5 hash:\n\nThe MD5 “af3e8be26c63c4dd066935629cf9bac8” has been solved by Kaspersky Lab as\n[the password “kenpachi”. In February 2014 we observed the Miniduke threat actor using the](https://securelist.com/the-miniduke-mystery-pdf-0-day-government-spy-assembler-0x29a-micro-backdoor/31112/)\nsame backdoor on their hacked servers, although using a much stronger password.\n\nOnce again, it is also interesting to point out the usage of Codepage 1251 in the webshell,\nwhich is used to render Cyrillic characters.\n\nThere appears to be several links between Turla and Miniduke, but we will leave that for a\nfuture blogpost.\n\n## Victim statistics\n\n\n-----\n\nOn some of the C&C servers used in the Epic attacks, we were able to identify detailed\nvictim statistics, which were saved for debugging purposes by the attackers.\n\nThis is the country distribution for the top 20 affected countries by victim’s IP:\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the public information available for the victims IPs, targets of Epic belong to\nthe following categories:\n\nGovernment\n\nMinistry of interior (EU country)\nMinistry of trade and commerce (EU country)\nMinistry of foreign/external affairs (Asian country, EU country)\nIntelligence (Middle East, EU Country)\nEmbassies\nMilitary (EU country)\nEducation\nResearch (Middle East)\nPharmaceutical companies\nUnknown (impossible to determine based on IP/existing data)\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen G-Data published their Turla paper, there were few details publicly available on how\nvictims get infected with this malware campaign.
