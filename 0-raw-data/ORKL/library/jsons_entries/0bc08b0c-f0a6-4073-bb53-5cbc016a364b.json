Although it was not publicly attributed to any Russian\nintelligence service, past Calisto operations showed objectives and victimology that align\nclosely with Russian strategic interests.\n\n[Calisto mainly focuses on Western countries, especially the United States, and Eastern](https://blog.sekoia.io/calisto-continues-its-credential-harvesting-campaign/)\nEuropean countries. The group was observed carrying out phishing campaigns aiming at\n**credential theft, targeting military and strategic research sectors such as NATO entities and**\na Ukraine-based defense contractor, as well as NGOs and think tanks. Additional victimology\nincludes former ntelligence officials, experts in Russian matters, and Russian citizens\nabroad.\n\nWhile Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) publicly associated Calisto with Gamaredon Group,\nan intrusion set attributed to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) that focuses\nessentially on Ukraine operations since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February\n2022, this link is not supported by other security companies or researchers. SEKOIA.IO\nconducted further technical investigations but did not find any overlap between Calisto and\nGamaredon activities.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nBased on SEKOIA.IO EvilNgix trackers, we came across domains, known to us as aligning\nwith past Calisto activities. Further investigations led to a larger infrastructure composed of\nmore than 80 domains, including domains typosquatting entites.\n\nAs several of these domains were already known and resolving IP addresses already\nattributed to [Calisto activities, SEKOIA.IO associates these domains to Calisto with high](https://blog.sekoia.io/calisto-continues-its-credential-harvesting-campaign/)\n**confidence.**\n\nIn past observed campaigns, Calisto operators sent malicious PDF attachments to their\nvictims. The first page of the PDF mimics an error in the PDF renderer engine, inciting the\nvictim to open a link leading to a malicious web page. This webpage aims at gathering the\nvictim’s credentials by using EvilGinx. Here are a few examples of PDF retrieved in this\ninvestigation:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. First pages of malicious PDF sent by Calisto\nThe last pages of the documents contain blobs of spirals and text, as shown below.\nSEKOIA.IO analysts still don’t know why such gibberish is used as it appears useless as an\nanti-detection trick. However, the idea to put the phishing link in a PDF instead of in the email\nbody prevents link analysis from email gateways and is a good tactic to remain undetected\nfrom an attacker point of view.\n\nFigure 2. Garbage present in the last document pages\n\n## Victimology analysis\n\nSEKOIA.IO conducted open-source research on the typosquatted domains, to identify\ntargets. As we redact this paper, we found six private companies based in the US and\n**Eastern Europe, and four Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), all involved in**\nUkraine support. SEKOIA.IO contacted the NGOs to get the phishing email or payload.\n\nOne of them shared the email exchange between the victim and the attacker using a\n\nspoofed email from a “trusted source”, including the malicious PDF payload, a technique\npreviously observed in Calisto campaigns. The email exchange shows that the attacker did\n\n\n-----\n\nnot include the malicious payload in the first email, but waited to get an answer to build a\nrelationship and avoid suspicion before sending the payload to the victim. That Calisto\nsocial engineering technique was already observed by Microsoft.\n\nMost of the targeted private organizations are involved in military equipment, military\n**logistics or humanitarian support for Ukraine, including a US company that provides**\nhumanitarian logistics and possibly tactical equipment to Kiev. Other sectors include\ncommunication technologies and cybersecurity (medium confidence) :\n\n**UMO, Polish company, military equipment (high confidence);**\n**Emcompass, Ukrainian company, military logistic (high confidence);**\n**DTGruelle, US company, logistics (high confidence);**\n**Global Ordnance, US company, military and tactical equipment (high confidence);**\n**BotGuard, Estonian company, cybersecurity (medium confidence);**\n**Blue Sky Network, US company, satellite communications (high confidence).**\n\nAdditional potential victims include NGOs and think tanks involved in conflict resolution and\nwar crime investigation, including an organization also involved in the Syrian civil war crime\ninvestigation and previously targeted by an Indian hack-for-hire company in June 2020. Most\nof the NGOs and think tanks targeted are publicly supporting Ukraine.\n\n**International Center on Nonviolent Conflict, US think tank promoting non-military**\nstrategies by civilian-based movements to defend human rights (high confidence);\n**Commission for International Justice and Accountability, Europe-based NGO,**\nproof collection for human rights violation and war crime (high confidence);\n**Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, Swiss-based NGO, mediation and diplomacy for**\nconflict resolution (high confidence);\n**Foundation for support of reforms in Ukraine, Ukraine-based NGO, economic**\nreforms promotion, likely involved in post-war reconstruction planning (medium\nconfidence).\n\nSEKOIA.IO notes that the observed victimology through the investigation matches known\nCalisto victimology, namely strategic research, civil society and military equipment sectors,\nas well as entities and individuals involved in Russian matters.\n\n## Calisto targets non-directly related to Ukraine support\n\nAmong discovered Calisto malicious domains, three caught SEKOIA.IO analysts’ attention,\nmvd-redir[.]ru and dns-mvd[.]ru (high confidence) that are highly likely typosquatting the\n**Russian Ministry of Interior, and lk-nalog-gov[.]ru (low confidence) the Russian Federal**\nTaxation Service. Based on the fact that Calisto was observed targeting Russian individuals\n\n\n-----\n\nabroad, SEKOIA.IO assess it is plausible that Calisto conducts domestic surveillance\n**as well. Another less plausible hypothesis would be a false-flag maneuver to raise doubts on**\nthe infrastructure’s attribution.\n\nSEKOIA.IO found another potential victim that matches Calisto known targeting. The domain\n\nsangrail-share[.]com and sangrail-ltd[.]com are typosquatting Sangrail Inc., a private\nsecurity\n\ncompany, [registered in the UK on 31 July 2019 by Ian Walter Baharie. That name was used](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12131777)\n[as well to register AC21, a British private intelligence company focused on African politics.](https://www.ac21.co.uk/)\n[Interestingly, that name showed up in a 17-years-old data leak exposing a list of several MI6](https://cryptome.org/mi6-list2.htm)\nofficers on cryptome.org, a website dedicated to information leaks. That observation\nmatches Microsoft [assessment on Calisto targeting former intelligence officers.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite the absence of technical evidence associating Calisto activities with a known\nRussian cyber offensive service, SEKOIA.IO assess that this intrusion set intelligence\ncollection activities targeting parties involved in Ukraine support, especially those in the\ntactical equipment logistics, probably contribute to Russian efforts to disrupt Kiev supply**chain for military reinforcements.**\n\n[Discover our CTI and XDR products](https://sekoia.io/en/contact/)\n\nBased on the targeting of Commission for International Justice and Accountability NGO,\nSEKOIA.IO assess that Calisto contributes to Russian intelligence collection about\n**identified war crime-related evidence and/or international justice procedures, likely to**\nanticipate and build counter narrative on future accusations.\n\nTo provide our customers with actionable intelligence, SEKOIA.IO analysts will continue to\nmonitor state-sponsored advanced and persistent threats, including Calisto, as well as\ncybercrime related groups. We welcome any feedback and / or additional input to further\n**contribute to understanding and countering Calisto threat.**\n\n## IOCs & Technical Details\n\n\n-----\n\n```\naccess confirmation[.]com\n\nallow-access[.]com\n\nantibots-service[.]com\n\napicomcloud[.]com\n\nas-mvd[.]ru\n\nattach-docs[.]com\n\nattach-update[.]com\n\nblueskynetwork-drive[.]com\n\nblueskynetwork-shared[.]com\n\nbotguard-checker[.]com\n\nbotguard-web[.]com\n\nchallenge-identifier[.]com\n\nchallenge-share[.]com\n\nchecker-bot[.]com\n\ncija-docs[.]com\n\ncija-drive[.]com\n\ncloud-safety[.]online\n\ncloud-us[.]online\n\ndefault-dns[.]online\n\ndisk-previewer[.]com\n\ndns-cache[.]online\n\ndns-challenge[.]com\n\ndns-cookie[.]com\n\ndns-mvd[.]ru\n\ndocs-cache[.]online\n\ndocs-collector[.]com\n\ndocs-shared[.]online\n\ndocs-storage-ltd[.]com\n\ndocs-viewer[.]online\n\ndocs-web[.]online\n\ndocument-guard[.]com\n\ndocument-sender[.]com\n\ndrive-control[.]com\n\ndrive-defender[.]com\n\ndrive-global-ordnance[.]com\n\ndrive-globalordnance[.]com\n\ndrive-information[.]com\n\ndrive-previewer[.]com\n\ndrive-us[.]online\n\ndtgruelle-drive[.]com\n\ndtgruelle-us[.]com\n\nencompass-drive[.]com\n\nencompass-shared[.]com\n\nfilter-bot[.]com\n\nglobal-ordnance-drive[.]com\n\ngoweb-protect[.]com\n\ngoweb-service[.]com\n\nguard-checker[.]com\n\nhd-centre-drive[.]com\n\nhd-docs-share[.]com\n\nhypertexttech[.]com\n\nhypertextttech[.]com\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nland of service[.]com\n\nlive-identifier[.]com\n\nmvd-cloud[.]ru\n\nmvd-redir[.]ru\n\nnetwork-storage-ltd[.]com\n\nnonviolent-conflict-service[.]com\n\nnonviolent-conflict-storage[.]com\n\nonline-word[.]com\n\npreview-docs[.]com\n\npreview-docs[.]online\n\nprotectedshields-storage[.]com\n\nprotection-web-app[.]com\n\nproxycrioisolation[.]com\n\nredir-document[.]com\n\nresponse-collector[.]com\n\nresponse-filter[.]com\n\nresponse-mvd[.]ru\n\nresponse-redir[.]com\n\nsafe-proof[.]com\n\nsangrail-ltd[.]com\n\nsangrail-share[.]com\n\nselector-drafts[.]online\n\nshare-drive-ua[.]com\n\nsoaringeagle-drive[.]com\n\nstorage-service[.]online\n\nthreatcenterofreaserch[.]com\n\nthreatcenterofresearch[.]com\n\ntransfer-dns[.]com\n\ntransfer-record[.]com\n\numo-drive[.]com\n\numopl-drive[.]com\n\numopl[.]com\n\nwebview-service[.]com\n\n```\nThanks for the reading !
