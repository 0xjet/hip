The disclosure\ndetailed the activities of an advanced persistent threat (APT) adversary that was able to gain\naccess to SolarWinds systems to create trojanized updates to the Orion platform between\nMarch 2020 and possibly as recently as December 2020. The trojanized updates included a\ncustom, digitally signed backdoor called SUNBURST. SolarWinds Orion is a widely used\nnetwork infrastructure monitoring and management platform with a reported customer base\nof over 18,000. The following versions may be affected:\n\nOrion Platform 2019.4 HF5, version 2019.4.5200.9083\nOrion Platform 2020.2 RC1, version 2020.2.100.12219\nOrion Platform 2020.2 RC2, version 2020.2.5200.12394\nOrion Platform 2020.2, 2020.2 HF1, version 2020.2.5300.12432\n\nAt this time, the full scope of the attack remains under investigation. What is known is that\nthe attack was executed by a truly sophisticated adversary with a deep understanding of\noperational security and complex tradecraft. Based on publicly available data, this adversary\ndemonstrated significant efforts to evade, obfuscate, and clean-up using techniques such as\nsteganography, fingerprinting techniques to identify both target systems as well as analysis\nsystems, rotating infrastructure with a focus on geolocation proximity, as well as executing\ncode in memory as much as possible. These techniques, in combination with using a digitally\nsigned component of a trusted software platform as the initial infection vector, are indicative\nof a highly skilled and covert adversary willing to expend resources to assure the success of\ntheir operation.\n\n\n-----\n\nZscaler suggests that all organizations should take several immediate actions, described\nbelow, in addition to reviewing the existing security policies and best practices available to\nZscaler customers.\n\nThese actions are recommended for any organization that may be impacted by the\nSolarWinds event. They are not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all actions that an\norganization may take, and each organization should perform its own due diligence to\nassess impact and risk.\n\n## Investigation\n\nOrganizations should immediately identify all systems that may have SolarWinds Orion\ninstalled. Once the systems are identified, the version should be checked against the list of\nimpacted versions. Depending on the result of the version(s) installed, additional responses\nmay be required. Even if a version is not found on the impacted version list, it may be\nprudent to perform cursory checks to confirm there is no impact to the organization.\n\nIf an affected version of Orion is found, that system should be immediately taken offline and\nall network traffic blocked inbound and outbound. Any system or user accounts associated\nwith the affected system should be disabled and reviewed for legitimacy as well as access. If\npossible, a forensics image of the affected system should also be collected.\n\n**Network activity**\n\nBased on public reporting, a SolarWinds Orion system affected by this event—meaning that\nthe SUNBURST backdoor had been successfully installed—would begin network\ncommunication to its first stage command and control (C&C) server at avsvmcloud[.]com.\nWhile this activity does indicate that the affected system was within the target radius of the\nattack, it does not confirm additional compromise or post-exploitation actions. Zscaler\nInternet Access (ZIA) customers may be able to perform this search within the DNS Insights\nor Web Insights area in the portal, or within the log aggregator/SIEM of choice where ZIA\nlogs are sent. This data will however be limited to systems that have their network traffic\nrouted to ZIA.\n\nThe following network indicators may be used to perform a sweep for a timeframe extending\nback to March 2020 or further to discover possible compromised systems (note: additional\nindicators may be discovered as additional data is disclosed).\n\n**Domains**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\navsvmcloud[.]com\ndigitalcollege[.]org\nfreescanonline[.]com\ndeftsecurity[.]com\nthedoccloud[.]com \nwebsitetheme[.]com\nhighdatabase[.]com\nincomeupdate[.]com\ndatabasegalore[.]com\npanhardware[.]com \nzupertech[.]com \nseobundlekit[.]com\nlcomputers[.]com \nvirtualdataserver[.]com\nwebcodez[.]com \ninfinitysoftwares[.]com\nervsystem[.]com \nbigtopweb[.]com - Added 1/20/21 in relation to RainDrop\n\n```\n**IPs**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n13.59.205.66\n54.193.127.66\n54.215.192.52\n34.203.203.23\n139.99.115.204\n5.252.177.25\n5.252.177.21\n204.188.205.176\n51.89.125.18\n167.114.213.199\n\n```\nAll other internet-bound destinations from the Orion system should also be examined.\nAdditionally, all network activity originating from SolarWinds Orion systems to other internal\nsystems should be reviewed for potential lateral movement. This may prove challenging as\nmost Orion deployments likely allow it to have privileged access across the network to a\nvariety of systems. However, it may be possible to carve out a smaller set of data to initially\nanalyze by suppressing known-good or expected behaviors from the potentially affected\nOrion system.\n\n**Endpoint**\n\nThe SUNBURST backdoor is a digitally signed DLL file with a specific filename and hash.\nThe existence of this file on an Orion server is indicative that the adversary was able to gain\nunauthorized access to the system. Additional post-exploitation behaviors may have been\nperformed by the adversary, indicating a successful intrusion. The following indicators and\nbehaviors may assist in confirming a compromise.\n\n**MD5 hashes**\n```\nb91ce2fa41029f6955bff20079468448\nd5aad0d248c237360cf39c054b654d69\n2c4a910a1299cdae2a4e55988a2f102e\n846e27a652a5e1bfbd0ddd38a16dc865\n\n```\n**Filename**\n```\nSolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll\n\n```\n**Behaviors**\n\n\n-----\n\nModification of system tasks\ndelete-create-execute-delete-create directory action pattern\nNewly created or unknown local user accounts\nExistence or evidence of usage of Adfind.exe\nSigns of cmd.exe or rundll32.exe spawned from solarwinds.businesslayerhost.exe\nExistence of unknown and/or very broad email forwarding/deleting rules on the email\ngateway\n\n**User account activity**\n\nOnce SUNBURST has been deployed, the adversary will most likely begin to perform\nreconnaissance actions using the privileges of the Orion system and explore what is\navailable in terms of additional assets to compromise or actions to take. The following\nbehaviors may have been observed on the affected Orion system or other systems that have\nhad communication with the affected system.\n\nAnomalous logins or repeated failed authentication to internal systems\nLogins from unknown or unrecognized external sources to internal systems\nExtremely long duration tokens, which may indicate malicious activity (examine SAML\ntokens for duration)\n\n## Zscaler is here to help\n\n[As described in our ThreatLabZ blog post, Zscaler immediately deployed protections to all](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/zscaler-coverage-solarwinds-cyberattacks-and-fireeye-red-team-tools-theft)\ncustomers and continues to deploy additional protections and countermeasures as more\n[information becomes available.
