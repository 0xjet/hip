    "plain_text": "CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\n# Operation Gamework:\n## Infrastructure Overlaps Found Between BlueAlpha and Iranian APTs\n\n### By Insikt Group®\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Earlier this year, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group published research titled “Iranian](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iranian-cyber-operations-infrastructure/)_\n_[Threat Actor Amasses Large Infrastructure Network to Target Saudi Organizations,”](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iranian-cyber-operations-infrastructure/)_\n_which analyzed the network infrastructure of suspected Iranian state-sponsored CNO_\n_threat actors. We continued to monitor the activity until late July 2019 using proprietary_\n_techniques including Recorded Future network traffic analysis and Recorded Future_\n_domain analysis._\n\n_Data sources included the Recorded Future® Platform, Farsight Security’s DNSDB,_\n_ReversingLabs, VirusTotal, Shodan, and common OSINT tools._\n\n_The target audience for this research includes security practitioners and threat_\n_intelligence professionals who exhibit an interest in Russian and Iranian nation-state_\n_computer network operational activity._\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n[Over the course of 2019, there were several documented instances](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments)\nof Russian threat actor groups hijacking Iranian group infrastructure,\nmost recently with the U.K. National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)\nand U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) jointly releasing [an](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims)\n[advisory outlining how the Russian-attributed threat group Turla](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims)\nhad co-opted two Iranian malware families, likely without Iranian\nknowledge.\n\nIn our analysis, we uncovered evidence of an overlap in operational\ninfrastructure between a threat actor Insikt Group tracks as\nBlueAlpha and suspected Iranian nation-state activity. There is a\nstrong overlap between BlueAlpha and Gamaredon Group malware\nand infrastructure TTPs; therefore, we assess with moderate\nconfidence that BlueAlpha is a Russian state-sponsored threat\n[actor. Notably, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has attributed](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Operation_Armageddon_Final.pdf)\nthe Gamaredon Group to the FSB 16th and 18th divisions.\n\nFurther, we found more overlaps between infrastructure associated\nwith several well-documented Iranian threat actor groups, including\nAPT33 (Elfin), APT35 (Charming Kitten), and MUDDYWATER. Both\nAPT33 and APT35 are believed to be operating in line with strategic\npriorities set by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC); the\norganizational attribution for MUDDYWATER is less clear at this\nstage. For ease of comprehension, we will refer to the clustering of\nAPT33, APT35, and MUDDYWATER infrastructure as the “Iran-nexus”\nin this report. Please note that we do not assess, at this stage, that\nthese groups are a single homogenous Iranian threat actor, but\nrather that they all have notable overlapping TTPs.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Key Judgments\n\nWe continue to discover infrastructure overlaps among several\nIranian threat actor groups. When coupled with [our prior](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy/)\n[research on the tiered approach to the Iranian cyber operational](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy/)\nadministration, we assess that distinctions between these threat\nactor groups continue to blur, which leads us to consider the\nfollowing hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive:\n\n - Some form of organizational overlap is placed over the\n\nmanagement of operational resources between Iranian\ngroups.\n\n - The overlaps indicate that the groups are closely aligned,\n\nshare resources, and are possibly all working for the same\norganization, which we assess is likely to be the IRGC for the\nAPT33, APT35, and MUDDYWATER nexus.\n\n - The infrastructure overlaps point to a potential\n\nmisclassification of Iranian threat actor groups, or suggest\nthat the groups have evolved such that previous classifications\nmay be inadequate.\n\nIn two separate instances, we identified unique domain\ncharacteristics that linked a domain spoofing the Saudi International\nPetrochemical Company and used by the Iran-nexus threat actor\ngroup to the operational infrastructure of the suspected-Russian\nstate-sponsored threat actor BlueAlpha. We have high confidence\nin the association of these domains and the operational activity\nassociated with them to BlueAlpha in 2019, which points to the\nfollowing potential hypotheses:\n\n - BlueAlpha mimicked the TTPs of the Iran-nexus groups.\n\n[We assess that this is a likely scenario given the two (1, 2)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims)\nvery notable recent examples of FSB-affiliated threat actors\nhijacking Iranian APT infrastructure.\n\n - BlueAlpha commandeered old Iran-nexus group\n\ninfrastructure. Insikt Group assesses that this is also a likely\nscenario, given that other FSB-affiliated threat actors such as\nTurla have demonstrated an effective ability to use false flags.\n\n\n-----\n\n - Iran-nexus group mimicked Gamaredon Group TTPs. Insikt\n\nGroup assesses this to be an unlikely scenario, because it\nwould require a very high degree of technical and operational\npreparedness and would be a high-risk maneuver by the Irannexus group in order to target Ukrainian interests.\n\n - An operational collaboration exists between the Iran\nnexus group and BlueAlpha. While collaboration on training\nand sharing of techniques is plausible, actual operational\ninfrastructure sharing would require non-trivial deconfliction\nefforts to ensure targeted operations were effective. We\nassess this to be an unlikely scenario.\n\n#### Outlook\n\nOn October 21, the U.K. National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) and\nU.S. National Security Agency (NSA) jointly released [an advisory](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims)\noutlining how the Russian-attributed threat group Turla had coopted two Iranian tools, likely without Iranian knowledge. NCSC and\nNSA were able to make the distinction between the Iranian activity\nusing these tools and the Turla activity on the basis of three factors:\n\n1. Administration of infrastructure from either Turla or Iranian\nassociated IP addresses\n\n2. Turla group scanned for Iranian-associated backdoors\n\n3. Turla compromised Iranian infrastructure by deploying their\n\nown implants\n\n[Turla has been attributed by Estonian intelligence services and the](https://www.valisluureamet.ee/pdf/raport-2018-ENG-web.pdf)\n[Czech government to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber/hacking-the-hackers-russian-group-hijacked-iranian-spying-operation-officials-say-idUSKBN1X00AK)\nThe [Security Services of Ukraine as well as threat intelligence](https://ssu.gov.ua/ua/news/1/category/2/view/5487#.x5LjSNcQ.dpbs)\n[researchers have also attributed Gamaredon Group to the FSB.](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Operation_Armageddon_Final.pdf)\n\nIn our research, we observed significant overlapping operational\ninfrastructure between Iranian groups APT33, APT35, and\nMUDDYWATER. We assess with moderate confidence that all three\ngroups are likely tied to the IRGC and the continued blurring of TTPs\nbetween the three groups is likely to continue to inhibit clustering\nof IRGC-originated threat activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also uncovered significant overlaps between the operational\ninfrastructure for the Iran-nexus group and the Gamaredon Group.\nThe number of overlapping domains indicate our observations are\na key departure from previously reported Gamaredon activity.\nThis departure was the apparent Middle Eastern targeting, as\nGamaredon have typically targeted Ukrainian interests in the\npast. For that reason, we opted for the BlueAlpha designator for\nthe suspected Russia state-sponsored threat actor. We assess\nBlueAlpha and Gamaredon Group are closely aligned groups with\nsimilar TTPs and are both likely tied to Russia’s FSB. Insikt Group\nassesses that Russian state-sponsored groups will continue to\nconduct cyber operations that use techniques such as false flags\nor leverage vulnerable operational infrastructure of other threat\nactors in order to obfuscate activity and hinder attribution efforts.\n\n**About Recorded Future**\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete threat intelligence\n\nsolution powered by patented machine learning to lower risk.
