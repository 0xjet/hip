As we head into the U.S. election, we wanted to share\n\n\n-----\n\nan update on what we re seeing and how threat actors are changing their tactics.\n\n## What we’re seeing around the U.S. elections\n\nIn June, we [announced that we saw phishing attempts against the personal email accounts](https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1268589219842109440)\nof staffers on the Biden and Trump campaigns by Chinese and Iranian APTs (Advanced\nPersistent Threats) respectively. We haven’t seen any evidence of such attempts being\nsuccessful.\n\nThe Iranian attacker group (APT35) and the Chinese attacker group (APT31) targeted\ncampaign staffers’ personal emails with credential phishing emails and emails containing\ntracking links. As part of our wider tracking of APT31 activity, we've also seen them deploy\ntargeted malware campaigns.\n\nOne APT31 campaign was based on emailing links that would ultimately download malware\n[hosted on GitHub. The malware was a python-based implant using Dropbox for command](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b7571fe26056b7baa31b0935b6be42c8fa1d55a742c26d58b1c2e017394adc14/detection)\nand control. It would allow the attacker to upload and download files as well as execute\narbitrary commands. Every malicious piece of this attack was hosted on legitimate services,\nmaking it harder for defenders to rely on network signals for detection.\n\nIn one example, attackers impersonated McAfee. The targets would be prompted to install a\nlegitimate version of McAfee anti-virus software from GitHub, while malware was\nsimultaneously silently installed to the system.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample prompt from an APT31 campaign impersonating McAfee\n\nWhen we detect that a user is the target of a government-backed attack, we send them a\n[prominent warning. In these cases, we also shared our findings with the campaigns and the](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/08/a-reminder-about-government-backed.html)\nFederal Bureau of Investigation. This targeting is consistent with what others have\n[subsequently reported.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)\n\n\n-----\n\nNumber of “government backed attacker” warnings sent in 2020\n\nOverall, we’ve seen increased attention on the threats posed by APTs in the context of the\n[U.S. election. U.S government agencies have](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/News-Display/Article/2099666/joint-statement-from-dos-doj-dod-dhs-odni-fbi-nsa-and-cisa-on-preparations-for/) [warned about different threat actors, and](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020_10_06_homeland-threat-assessment.pdf)\nwe’ve [worked](https://twitter.com/googlepubpolicy/status/1293633488927825921?s=20) [closely with those agencies and others in the tech industry to share leads and](https://twitter.com/googlepubpolicy/status/1306334273159311363?s=20)\nintelligence about what we’re seeing across the ecosystem. This has resulted in action on\nour platforms, as well as others. Shortly after the U.S. Treasury [sanctioned Ukrainian](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1118)\nParliament member Andrii Derkach for attempting to influence the U.S. electoral process, we\nremoved 14 Google accounts that were linked to him.\n\n## Coordinated influence operations\n\nWe’ve been sharing actions against coordinated influence operations in our quarterly TAG\n[bulletin (check out our Q1,](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q1-2020) [Q2 and](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q2-2020/) [Q3 updates). To date, TAG has not identified any](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q3-2020/)\nsignificant coordinated influence campaigns targeting, or attempting to influence, U.S. voters\non our platforms.\n\n[Since last summer, TAG has tracked a large spam network linked to China attempting to run](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/maintaining-integrity-our-platforms/)\n[an influence operation, primarily on YouTube. This network has a presence across multiple](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/information-operations-june-2020.html)\n[platforms, and acts by primarily acquiring or hijacking existing accounts and posting spammy](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/removing-cib-china/)\ncontent in Mandarin such as videos of animals, music, food, plants, sports, and games. A\nsmall fraction of these spam channels will then post videos about current events. Such\nvideos frequently feature clumsy translations and computer-generated voices. Researchers\n[at Graphika and FireEye have detailed](https://public-assets.graphika.com/reports/Graphika_Report_Spamouflage_Returns.pdf) [how this network](https://public-assets.graphika.com/reports/graphika_report_spamouflage_goes_to_america.pdf) [behaves—including its shift from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O87AYlIPSyI&t=976s)\n\n\n-----\n\nposting content in Mandarin about issues related to Hong Kong and China s response to\nCOVID-19, to including a small subset of content in English and Mandarin about current\nevents in the U.S. (such as protests around racial justice, the wildfires on the West Coast,\nand the U.S. response to COVID-19).\n\nWe’ve taken an aggressive approach to identifying and removing content from this network—\nfor example, in Q3 alone, our Trust and Safety teams terminated more than 3,000 YouTube\nchannels. As a result, this network hasn’t been able to build an audience. Most of the videos\nwe identify have fewer than 10 views, and most of these views appear to come from related\nspam accounts rather than actual users. So while this network has posted frequently, the\nmajority of this content is spam and we haven’t seen it effectively reach an actual audience\n[on YouTube. We’ve shared our findings on this network in our Q2 and](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q2-2020/) [Q3 TAG bulletins and](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/tag-bulletin-q3-2020/)\nwill continue to update there.\n\n\n-----\n\nExamples of YouTube videos removed\n\n## New COVID-19 targets\n\nAs the course of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, we’ve seen threat actors evolve their\n[tactics as well. In previous posts, we discussed targeting of health organizations as well as](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/findings-covid-19-and-online-security-threats/)\nattacker efforts to [impersonate the World Health Organization. This summer, we and others](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/updates-about-government-backed-hacking-and-disinformation/)\n[observed threat actors from China, Russia and Iran targeting pharmaceutical companies and](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-moderna-cyber-excl/exclusive-china-backed-hackers-targeted-covid-19-vaccine-firm-moderna-idUSKCN24V38M)\nresearchers involved in vaccine development efforts.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn September, we started to see multiple North Korea groups shifting their targeting towards\nCOVID-19 researchers and pharmaceutical companies, including those based in South\nKorea. One campaign used URL shorteners and impersonated the target’s webmail portal in\nan attempt to harvest email credentials. In a separate campaign, attackers posed as\nrecruiting professionals to lure targets into downloading malware.\n\nSpoofed Outlook login panel used by North Korean attackers attempting to harvest\ncredentials\n\n## Tackling DDoS attacks as an industry\n\nIn the threat actor toolkit, different types of attacks are used for different purposes: Phishing\ncampaigns can be used like a scalpel—targeting specific groups or individuals with\npersonalized lures that are more likely to trick them into taking action (like clicking on a\nmalware link), while DDoS attacks are more like a hatchet—disrupting or blocking a site or a\nservice entirely. While it’s less common to see DDoS attacks rather than phishing or hacking\ncampaigns coming from government-backed threat groups, we’ve seen bigger players\nincrease their capabilities in launching large-scale attacks in recent years. For example in\n2017, our Security Reliability Engineering team measured a record-breaking UDP\namplification attack sourced out of several Chinese ISPs (ASNs 4134, 4837, 58453, and\n[9394), which remains the largest bandwidth attack of which we are aware.](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/identifying-and-protecting-against-the-largest-ddos-attacks)\n\nAddressing state-sponsored DDoS attacks requires a coordinated response from the internet\ncommunity, and we work with others to identify and dismantle infrastructure used to conduct\nattacks. Going forward, we’ll also use this blog to report attribution and activity we see in this\nspace from state-backed actors when we can do so with a high degree of confidence and in\na way that doesn’t disclose information to malicious actors.\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
