I'm closing the operation, decryptors are in\nzip files, clean. I will come back,\" AstraLocker's developer said. \"I'm done with ransomware\nfor now. I'm going in cryptojaking lol.\"\n\nWhile the developer did not reveal the reason behind the AstraLocker shutdown, it’s likely\n[due to the sudden publicity brought by recent reports that would land the operation in law](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/astralocker-20-infects-users-directly-from-word-attachments/)\nenforcement’s crosshairs.\n\n_AstraLocker decryption demo (BleepingComputer)_\n\n\n-----\n\nA universal decryptor for AstraLocker ransomware is currently in the works, to be released in\nthe future by Emsisoft, a software company known for helping ransomware victims with data\ndecryption.\n\nWhile it doesn't happen as often as we'd like, other ransomware groups have released\ndecryption keys and decryptors to BleepingComputer and security researchers as a gesture\nof goodwill when shutting down or releasing new versions.\n\n[The list of decryption tools released in the past includes Avaddon,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/) [Ragnarok,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnarok-ransomware-releases-master-decryptor-after-shutdown/) [SynAck,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/synack-ransomware-decryptor-lets-victims-recover-files-for-free/)\n[TeslaCrypt,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/teslacrypt-shuts-down-and-releases-master-decryption-key/) [Crysis,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/master-decryption-keys-and-decryptor-for-the-crysis-ransomware-released/) [AES-NI,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/aes-ni-ransomware-dev-releases-decryption-keys-amid-fears-of-being-framed-for-xdata-outbreak/) [Shade,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shade-ransomware-shuts-down-releases-750k-decryption-keys/) [FilesLocker,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/master-decryption-key-released-for-fileslocker-ransomware/) [Ziggy, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ziggy-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-victims-decryption-keys/) [FonixLocker.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fonix-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-master-decryption-key/)\n\n## AstraLocker ransomware background\n\nAs threat intelligence firm ReversingLabs recently revealed, AstraLocker used a somewhat\nunorthodox method of encrypting its victims' devices compared to other ransomware strains.\n\nInstead of first compromising the device (either by hacking it or buying access from other\nthreat actors), AstraLocker's operator would directly deploy the payloads from email\nattachments using malicious Microsoft Word documents.\n\nThe lures used in AstroLocker attacks are documents hiding an OLE object with the\nransomware payload that will get deployed after the target clicks Run in the warning dialog\ndisplayed when opening the document.\n\n_AstraLocker ransom note (ReversingLabs)_\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore encrypting files on the now-compromised device, the ransomware will check if it s\nrunning in a virtual machine, kill processes and stop backup and AV services that would\nhinder the encryption process.\n\nBased on ReversingLabs' analysis, AstraLocker is based on the leaked Babuk Locker\n(Babyk) ransomware source code, a buggy but still dangerous strain that exited the space in\nSeptember 2021.\n\nAdditionally, one of the Monero wallet addresses in AstraLocker's ransom note was also\n[linked to the operators of Chaos ransomware.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chaos-ransomware-targets-gamers-via-fake-minecraft-alt-lists/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[No More Ransom helps millions of ransomware victims in 6 years](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/no-more-ransom-helps-millions-of-ransomware-victims-in-6-years/)\n\n[Free decryptor released for AstraLocker, Yashma ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-astralocker-yashma-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[AstraLocker 2.0 infects users directly from Word attachments](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/astralocker-20-infects-users-directly-from-word-attachments/)\n\n[BlackByte ransomware gang is back with new extortion tactics](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackbyte-ransomware-gang-is-back-with-new-extortion-tactics/)\n\n[Hackers attack UK water supplier but extort wrong company](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-attack-uk-water-supplier-but-extort-wrong-company/)\n\n\n-----",
