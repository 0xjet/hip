For more_\n_information regarding this series of adversary playbooks being created by CTA members,_\n_[please visit the Cyber Threat Alliance Playbook Whitepaper.](https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CTA_Adversary-Playbook-Principles_White-Paper.pdf)_\n\nActive since 2014, Goblin Panda is a threat actor that is focused on interests in Southeast\n[Asia. Goblin Panda has been documented by various organizations, including Fortinet, over](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/rehashed-rat-used-in-apt-campaign-against-vietnamese-organizations.html)\nthe past several years. Due to non-standardized naming conventions within the industry,\nGoblin Panda is also known as APT 27, Hellsing, Cycledek, and perhaps 1937CN. Goblin\nPanda is primarily active in South and Southeast Asia, with activity seen primarily in\nCambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. India has\nalso been targeted in the past, albeit in limited numbers.\n\nNot much has been documented on this group for various reasons. This is primarily due the\nfact that its tactics, techniques, and procedures have evolved over the years, and also\nbecause rather than engaging in the sort of broad-brush attacks most cybercriminal gangs\n\n\n-----\n\nengage in, their targets and campaigns have been quite specific in nature. We hope that the\ninformation contained within our playbook is informative for responders who encounter one\nof their attacks, or for anyone interested in Goblin Panda.\n\n**Overview**\n\nFavorite methodologies of Goblin Panda include the use of remote access Trojans, including\nthe infamous PlugX/Korplug, NewCore, and Sisfader RAT tools. Distribution of infected\nsamples are often used by attackers such as Goblin Panda through weaponized Microsoft\nOffice documents containing malicious macros, or by exploiting known vulnerabilities—most\nrecently CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2017-11882. Even though CVE-2012-0158 is over five\nyears old, attackers are quite aware that many organizations, especially up and coming\norganizations in developing areas of the world, do not follow a regular patching schedule for\nvarious reasons, such as lack of resources or awareness, and therefore remain vulnerable to\nknow exploits for long periods of time.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nObserved instances of Goblin Panda activity have generally started with a spearphishing\nattacks via a maliciously crafted Microsoft Office document. When the document is opened\nby the victim, various files are dropped into different locations of the victim’s PC. Dropped\nfiles include legitimate software vendor files, an encrypted binary blog containing the\npayload, and DLL files containing the decryptor and loader for the payload.\n\nDuring the installation of the malware, a DLL hijacking technique to evade traditional\nantivirus detections is used whereby a variety of legitimate DLL files from different vendors\nare hijacked using a Trojanized version of a malicious DLL file. Once the malicious DLL file is\nside loaded, it then downloads the Trojan downloader, which in turn sets a run key in the\nregistry for persistence. Typically, a legitimate program requires libraries to properly execute.\nDLL sideloading/hijacking attacks makes the legitimate program think it is loading the correct\nDLL, when in reality it is loading the malicious DLL instead. Finally, it also checks to\ndetermine if it is running in a VM environment.\n\nOnce it is finished with those tasks, it then sends various parameters to a C2 server,\nincluding:\n\n-   OS version\n\n-   Processor speed\n\n-   Number of processors\n\n-   Physical memory size\n\n-   Computer name\n\n\n-----\n\n-   User name\n\n-   User privilege\n\n-   Computer IP address\n\n-   Volume serial number\n\nWhen all of those parameters are deemed ok, it then downloads a payload. In most recent\ncases, that payload has been the NewCore RAT (Korplug/Plugx and Sisfader were seen in\nprior campaigns). The NewCore RAT is a malicious DLL file. However, executing the DLL\nwithout using the downloader will not work as the C&C server string is not embedded within\nthe DLL file. Based on the strings found in its body, this malware may have been derived\nfrom the PcClient and PcCortr backdoors whose source codes are publicly available,\nespecially on Chinese language coding forums.\n\nNewCore RAT has the following attributes:\n\n-   Copy files\n\n-   Delete files\n\n-   Execute files\n\n-   Search files\n\n-   Download files\n\n-   Upload files\n\n-   Retrieve disk list\n\n-   Retrieve directory list\n\n-   Retrieve file information\n\n-   Retrieve disk information\n\n-   Rename files\n\n-   Screen monitoring\n\n-   Start command shell\n\n-   Shutdown/Reboot\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have also encountered several new NewCore RAT samples that may have been used by\nthe Goblin Panda threat actors. However, due to time constraints we were unable to analyze\nthem further to see if there is an absolute connection to the threat actor group. The following\nIOCs have been provided for information purposes. Please see the Indictors of Compromise\n[section below for further details, along with our playbook viewer, which contains the tactics](https://www.fortiguard.com/playbook_viewer)\nand techniques defined by the Mitre ATT&CK knowledge base.\n\nFor a detailed technical overview, read our previous blog: Rehashed RAT Used in APT\n_Campaign Against Vietnamese Organizations_\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n_All samples (IOCs) have been provided in good faith. These samples had not been analyzed_\n_at the time of publication due to time restrictions.
