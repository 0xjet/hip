The \"ED\" parameter copies the\nDLL into executable memory and invokes the entry point directly. The preexisting \"RD\"\nparameter that was used to inject the downloaded DLL into EXCEL.EXE can now perform\ninjection into WINWORD.EXE as well.\n\nThe reconfigured loader is meant to allow the group to carry out its operations without\ndrawing the attention of enterprise defenses. In the past, it has been used to download the\nSDBbot, FlawedGrace and other malware.\n\nTA505 is a prolific Russian-speaking, financially-motivated group that is known for\n[launching large-scale targeted attacks. The group was most recently discovered going after](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ta505-targets-hr-departments-with-poisoned-cvs-/d/d-id/1337355)\nGerman-speaking targets with weaponized CVs. Intel 471 also observed the group going after\ntargets in Japan, South Korea, United Arab Emirates in 2019. Once the group's malware or\nactions are caught by researchers or the press, the group tends to go silent in an effort to\nreconfigure its tools.\n\nDrawing from past experiences, Intel 471 believes that new, undiscovered malware\ncampaigns will follow with the introduction of the reconfigured Get2 Loader.\n\n\"TA505 can be somewhat deliberate in how they operate, more so than most of the\nfinancially-motivated groups we track,\" said Intel 471 COO Jason Passwaters. \"Once things\nstart ramping up like this, rest assured they are back at it with a target list in hand.\"\n\nThe Intel 471 adversary intelligence on major threat groups such as TA505 and our unique\ninsight into its capabilities, intent and motivations, can be leveraged by threat intelligence\nteams to remain proactive and resilient against attacks as cybercriminals modify TTPs.\n\n\n-----",
