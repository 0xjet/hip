Microsoft Security tracks more than 35 unique ransomware\nfamilies and 250 unique threat actors across observed nation-state, ransomware, and\ncriminal activities.\n\nThat depth of signal intelligence gathered from various domains—identity, email, data, and\ncloud—provides us with insight into the gig economy that attackers have created with tools\ndesigned to lower the barrier for entry for other attackers, who in turn continue to pay\ndividends and fund operations through the sale and associated “cut” from their tool’s\nsuccess.\n\nThe cybercriminal economy is a continuously evolving connected ecosystem of many players\nwith different techniques, goals, and skillsets. In the same way our traditional economy has\nshifted toward gig workers for efficiency, criminals are learning that there’s less work and less\nrisk involved by renting or selling their tools for a portion of the profits than performing the\nattacks themselves. This industrialization of the cybercrime economy has made it easier for\nattackers to use ready-made penetration testing and other tools to perform their attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin this category of threats, Microsoft has been tracking the trend in the ransomware-asa-service (RaaS) gig economy, called [human-operated ransomware, which remains one of](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/)\nthe most impactful threats to organizations. We coined the industry term “human-operated\nransomware” to clarify that these threats are driven by humans who make decisions at every\nstage of their attacks based on what they find in their target’s network.\n\nUnlike the broad targeting and opportunistic approach of earlier ransomware infections,\nattackers behind these human-operated campaigns vary their attack patterns depending on\ntheir discoveries—for example, a security product that isn‘t configured to prevent tampering\nor a service that’s running as a highly privileged account like a domain admin. Attackers can\nuse those weaknesses to elevate their privileges to steal even more valuable data, leading to\na bigger payout for them—with no guarantee they’ll leave their target environment once\nthey’ve been paid. Attackers are also often more determined to stay on a network once they\ngain access and sometimes repeatedly monetize that access with additional attacks using\ndifferent malware or ransomware payloads if they aren’t successfully evicted.\n\nRansomware attacks have become even more impactful in recent years as more\nransomware-as-a-service ecosystems have adopted the double extortion monetization\nstrategy. All ransomware is a form of extortion, but now, attackers are not only encrypting\ndata on compromised devices but also exfiltrating it and then posting or threatening to post it\npublicly to pressure the targets into paying the ransom. Most ransomware attackers\nopportunistically deploy ransomware to whatever network they get access to, and some even\npurchase access to networks from other cybercriminals. Some attackers prioritize\norganizations with higher revenues, while others prefer specific industries for the shock value\nor type of data they can exfiltrate.\n\nAll human-operated ransomware campaigns—all human-operated attacks in general, for that\nmatter—share common dependencies on security weaknesses that allow them to succeed.\nAttackers most commonly take advantage of an organization’s poor **credential hygiene**\n**and legacy configurations or misconfigurations to find easy entry and privilege**\n**escalation points in an environment.**\n\nIn this blog, we detail several of the ransomware ecosystems using the RaaS model, the\nimportance of cross-domain visibility in finding and evicting these actors, and best practices\norganizations can use to protect themselves from this increasingly popular style of attack.\nWe also offer security best practices on credential hygiene and cloud hardening, how to\naddress security blind spots, harden internet-facing assets to understand your perimeter, and\nmore. Here’s a quick table of contents:\n\n## How RaaS redefines our understanding of ransomware incidents\n\nWith ransomware being the preferred method for many cybercriminals to monetize attacks,\nhuman-operated ransomware remains one of the most impactful threats to organizations\ntoday, and it only continues to evolve. This evolution is driven by the “human-operated”\n\n\n-----\n\naspect of these attacks—attackers make informed and calculated decisions, resulting in\nvaried attack patterns tailored specifically to their targets and iterated upon until the attackers\nare successful or evicted.\n\nIn the past, we’ve observed a tight relationship between the initial entry vector, tools, and\nransomware payload choices in each campaign of one strain of ransomware. The RaaS\naffiliate model, which has allowed more criminals, regardless of technical expertise, to deploy\nransomware built or managed by someone else, is weakening this link. As ransomware\ndeployment becomes a gig economy, it has become more difficult to link the tradecraft used\nin a specific attack to the ransomware payload developers.\n\nReporting a ransomware incident by assigning it with the payload name gives the impression\nthat a monolithic entity is behind all attacks using the same ransomware payload and that all\nincidents that use the ransomware share common techniques and infrastructure. However,\nfocusing solely on the ransomware stage obscures many stages of the attack that come\nbefore, including actions like data exfiltration and additional persistence mechanisms, as well\nas the numerous detection and protection opportunities for network defenders.\n\nWe know, for example, that the underlying techniques used in human-operated ransomware\ncampaigns haven’t changed very much over the years—attacks still prey on the same\nsecurity misconfigurations to succeed. Securing a large corporate network takes disciplined\nand sustained focus, but there’s a high ROI in implementing critical controls that prevent\nthese attacks from having a wider impact, even if it’s only possible on the most critical assets\nand segments of the network.\n\nWithout the ability to steal access to highly privileged accounts, attackers can’t move\nlaterally, spread ransomware widely, access data to exfiltrate, or use tools like Group Policy\nto impact security settings. Disrupting common attack patterns by applying security controls\nalso reduces alert fatigue in security SOCs by stopping the attackers before they get in. This\ncan also prevent unexpected consequences of short-lived breaches, such as exfiltration of\nnetwork topologies and configuration data that happens in the first few minutes of execution\nof some trojans.\n\nIn the following sections, we explain the RaaS affiliate model and disambiguate between the\nattacker tools and the various threat actors at play during a security incident. Gaining this\nclarity helps surface trends and common attack patterns that inform defensive strategies\nfocused on preventing attacks rather than detecting ransomware payloads. Threat\nintelligence and insights from this research also enrich our solutions like Microsoft 365\nDefender, whose comprehensive security capabilities help protect customers by detecting\nRaaS-related attack attempts.\n\n### The RaaS affiliate model explained\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cybercriminal economy—a connected ecosystem of many players with different\ntechniques, goals, and skillsets—is evolving. The industrialization of attacks has progressed\nfrom attackers using off-the-shelf tools, such as Cobalt Strike, to attackers being able to\npurchase access to networks and the payloads they deploy to them. This means that the\nimpact of a successful ransomware and extortion attack remains the same regardless of the\nattacker’s skills.\n\nRaaS is an arrangement between an operator and an affiliate. The RaaS operator develops\nand maintains the tools to power the ransomware operations, including the builders that\nproduce the ransomware payloads and payment portals for communicating with victims. The\nRaaS program may also include a leak site to share snippets of data exfiltrated from victims,\nallowing attackers to show that the exfiltration is real and try to extort payment. Many RaaS\nprograms further incorporate a suite of extortion support offerings, including leak site hosting\nand integration into ransom notes, as well as decryption negotiation, payment pressure, and\ncryptocurrency transaction services\n\nRaaS thus gives a unified appearance of the payload or campaign being a single\nransomware family or set of attackers. However, what happens is that the RaaS operator\nsells access to the ransom payload and decryptor to an affiliate, who performs the intrusion\nand privilege escalation and who is responsible for the deployment of the actual ransomware\npayload. The parties then split the profit. In addition, RaaS developers and operators might\nalso use the payload for profit, sell it, and run their campaigns with other ransomware\npayloads—further muddying the waters when it comes to tracking the criminals behind these\nactions.\n\nFigure 1. How the RaaS affiliate model enables ransomware attacks\n\n### Access for sale and mercurial targeting\n\n\n-----\n\nA component of the cybercriminal economy is selling access to systems to other attackers\nfor various purposes, including ransomware. Access brokers can, for instance, infect\nsystems with malware or a botnet and then sell them as a “load”. A load is designed to install\nother malware or backdoors onto the infected systems for other criminals. Other access\nbrokers scan the internet for vulnerable systems, like exposed Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP) systems with weak passwords or unpatched systems, and then compromise them en\n_masse to “bank” for later profit. Some advertisements for the sale of initial access specifically_\ncite that a system isn’t managed by an antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR)\nproduct and has a highly privileged credential such as Domain Administrator associated with\nit to fetch higher prices.\n\nMost ransomware attackers opportunistically deploy ransomware to whatever network they\nget access to. Some attackers prioritize organizations with higher revenues, while some\ntarget specific industries for the shock value or type of data they can exfiltrate (for example,\nattackers targeting hospitals or exfiltrating data from technology companies). In many cases,\nthe targeting doesn’t manifest itself as specifically attacking the target’s network, instead, the\npurchase of access from an access broker or the use of existing malware infection to pivot to\nransomware activities.\n\nIn some ransomware attacks, the affiliates who bought a load or access may not even know\nor care how the system was compromised in the first place and are just using it as a “jump\nserver” to perform other actions in a network. Access brokers often list the network details for\nthe access they are selling, but affiliates aren’t usually interested in the network itself but\nrather the monetization potential. As a result, some attacks that seem targeted to a specific\nindustry might simply be a case of affiliates purchasing access based on the number of\nsystems they could deploy ransomware to and the perceived potential for profit.\n\n## “Human-operated” means human decisions\n\nMicrosoft coined the term “human-operated ransomware” to clearly define a class of attacks\ndriven by expert human intelligence at every step of the attack chain and culminate in\nintentional business disruption and extortion. Human-operated ransomware attacks share\ncommonalities in the security misconfigurations of which they take advantage and the\nmanual techniques used for lateral movement and persistence. However, the humanoperated nature of these actions means that variations in attacks—including objectives and\npre-ransom activity—evolve depending on the environment and the unique opportunities\nidentified by the attackers.\n\nThese attacks involve many reconnaissance activities that enable human operators to profile\nthe organization and know what next steps to take based on specific knowledge of the target.\nMany of the initial access campaigns that provide access to RaaS affiliates perform\nautomated reconnaissance and exfiltration of information collected in the first few minutes of\nan attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the attack shifts to a hands-on-keyboard phase, the reconnaissance and activities\nbased on this knowledge can vary, depending on the tools that come with the RaaS and the\noperator’s skill. Frequently attackers query for the currently running security tools, privileged\nusers, and security settings such as those defined in Group Policy before continuing their\nattack. The data discovered via this reconnaissance phase informs the attacker’s next steps.\n\nIf there’s minimal security hardening to complicate the attack and a highly privileged account\ncan be gained immediately, attackers move directly to deploying ransomware by editing a\nGroup Policy. The attackers take note of security products in the environment and attempt to\ntamper with and disable these, sometimes using scripts or tools provided with RaaS\npurchase that try to disable multiple security products at once, other times using specific\ncommands or techniques performed by the attacker.\n\nThis human decision-making early in the reconnaissance and intrusion stages means that\neven if a target’s security solutions detect specific techniques of an attack, the attackers may\nnot get fully evicted from the network and can use other collected knowledge to attempt to\ncontinue the attack in ways that bypass security controls. In many instances, attackers test\ntheir attacks “in production” from an undetected location in their target’s environment,\ndeploying tools or payloads like commodity malware. If these tools or payloads are detected\nand blocked by an antivirus product, the attackers simply grab a different tool, modify their\npayload, or tamper with the security products they encounter. Such detections could give\nSOCs a false sense of security that their existing solutions are working. However, these\ncould merely serve as a smokescreen to allow the attackers to further tailor an attack chain\nthat has a higher probability of success. Thus, when the attack reaches the active attack\nstage of deleting backups or shadow copies, the attack would be minutes away from\nransomware deployment. The adversary would likely have already performed harmful\nactions like the exfiltration of data. This knowledge is key for SOCs responding to\nransomware: prioritizing investigation of alerts or detections of tools like Cobalt Strike and\nperforming swift remediation actions and incident response (IR) procedures are critical for\ncontaining a human adversary before the ransomware deployment stage.\n\n### Exfiltration and double extortion\n\nRansomware attackers often profit simply by disabling access to critical systems and causing\nsystem downtime. Although that simple technique often motivates victims to pay, it is not the\nonly way attackers can monetize their access to compromised networks. Exfiltration of data\nand “double extortion,” which refers to attackers threatening to leak data if a ransom hasn’t\nbeen paid, has also become a common tactic among many RaaS affiliate programs—many\nof them offering a unified leak site for their affiliates. Attackers take advantage of common\nweaknesses to exfiltrate data and demand ransom without deploying a payload.\n\nThis trend means that focusing on protecting against ransomware payloads via security\nproducts or encryption, or considering backups as the main defense against ransomware,\ninstead of comprehensive hardening, leaves a network vulnerable to all the stages of a\n\n\n-----\n\nhuman-operated ransomware attack that occur before ransomware deployment. This\nexfiltration can take the form of using tools like Rclone to sync to an external site, setting up\nemail transport rules, or uploading files to cloud services. With double extortion, attackers\ndon’t need to deploy ransomware and cause downtime to extort money. Some attackers\nhave moved beyond the need to deploy ransomware payloads and are shifting straight to\nextortion models or performing the destructive objectives of their attacks by directly deleting\ncloud resources. One such extortion attackers is DEV-0537 (also known as LAPSUS$),\nwhich is profiled below.\n\n### Persistent and sneaky access methods\n\nPaying the ransom may not reduce the risk to an affected network and potentially only\nserves to fund cybercriminals. Giving in to the attackers’ demands doesn’t guarantee that\nattackers ever “pack their bags” and leave a network. Attackers are more determined to stay\non a network once they gain access and sometimes repeatedly monetize attacks using\ndifferent malware or ransomware payloads if they aren’t successfully evicted.\n\nThe handoff between different attackers as transitions in the cybercriminal economy occur\nmeans that multiple attackers may retain persistence in a compromised environment using\nan entirely different set of tools from those used in a ransomware attack. For example, initial\naccess gained by a banking trojan leads to a Cobalt Strike deployment, but the RaaS affiliate\nthat purchased the access may choose to use a less detectable remote access tool such as\nTeamViewer to maintain persistence on the network to operate their broader series of\ncampaigns. Using legitimate tools and settings to persist versus malware implants such as\nCobalt Strike is a popular technique among ransomware attackers to avoid detection and\nremain resident in a network for longer.\n\nSome of the common enterprise tools and techniques for persistence that Microsoft has\nobserved being used include:\n\nAnyDesk\nAtera Remote Management\nngrok.io\nRemote Manipulator System\nSplashtop\nTeamViewer\n\nAnother popular technique attackers perform once they attain privilege access is the creation\nof new backdoor user accounts, whether local or in Active Directory. These newly created\naccounts can then be added to remote access tools such as a virtual private network (VPN)\nor Remote Desktop, granting remote access through accounts that appear legitimate on the\nnetwork. Ransomware attackers have also been observed editing the settings on systems to\nenable Remote Desktop, reduce the protocol’s security, and add new users to the Remote\nDesktop Users group.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe time between initial access to a hands-on keyboard deployment can vary wildly\ndepending on the groups and their workloads or motivations. Some activity groups can\naccess thousands of potential targets and work through these as their staffing allows,\nprioritizing based on potential ransom payment over several months. While some activity\ngroups may have access to large and highly resourced companies, they prefer to attack\nsmaller companies for less overall ransom because they can execute the attack within hours\nor days. In addition, the return on investment is higher from companies that can’t respond to\na major incident. Ransoms of tens of millions of dollars receive much attention but take much\nlonger to develop. Many groups prefer to ransom five to 10 smaller targets in a month\nbecause the success rate at receiving payment is higher in these targets. Smaller\norganizations that can’t afford an IR team are often more likely to pay tens of thousands of\ndollars in ransom than an organization worth millions of dollars because the latter has a\ndeveloped IR capability and is likely to follow legal advice against paying. In some instances,\na ransomware associate threat actor may have an implant on a network and never convert it\nto ransom activity. In other cases, initial access to full ransom (including handoff from an\naccess broker to a RaaS affiliate) takes less than an hour.\n\nFigure 2. Human-operated ransomware targeting and rate of success, based on a sampling\nof Microsoft data over six months between 2021 and 2022\nThe human-driven nature of these attacks and the scale of possible victims under control of\nransomware-associated threat actors underscores the need to take targeted proactive\nsecurity measures to harden networks and prevent these attacks in their early stages.\n\n## Threat actors and campaigns deep dive: Threat intelligence-driven response to human-operated ransomware attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nFor organizations to successfully respond to evict an active attacker, it s important to\nunderstand the active stage of an ongoing attack. In the early attack stages, such as\ndeploying a banking trojan, common remediation efforts like isolating a system and resetting\nexposed credentials may be sufficient. As the attack progresses and the attacker performs\nreconnaissance activities and exfiltration, it’s important to implement an incident response\nprocess that scopes the incident to address the impact specifically. Using a threat\nintelligence-driven methodology for understanding attacks can assist in determining incidents\nthat need additional scoping.\n\nIn the next sections, we provide a deep dive into the following prominent ransomware threat\nactors and their campaigns to increase community understanding of these attacks and\nenable organizations to better protect themselves:\n\nDEV-0193 cluster (Trickbot LLC): The most prolific ransomware group today\nELBRUS: (Un)arrested development\nDEV-0504: Shifting payloads reflecting the rise and fall of RaaS programs\nDEV-0237: Prolific collaborator\nDEV-0206 and DEV-0243: An “evil” partnership\nDEV-0401: China-based lone wolf turned LockBit 2.0 affiliate\nDEV-0537: From extortion to destruction\n\nMicrosoft threat intelligence directly informs our products as part of our commitment to track\nadversaries and protect customers. Microsoft 365 Defender customers should prioritize\nalerts titled “Ransomware-linked emerging threat activity group detected”. We also add the\nnote “Ongoing hands-on-keyboard attack” to alerts that indicate a human attacker is in the\nnetwork. When these alerts are raised, it’s highly recommended to initiate an incident\nresponse process to scope the attack, isolate systems, and regain control of credentials\nattackers may be in control of.\n\nA note on threat actor naming: as part of Microsoft’s ongoing commitment to track both\nnation-state and cybercriminal threat actors, we refer to the unidentified threat actors as a\n“development group”. We use a naming structure with a prefix of “DEV” to indicate an\nemerging threat group or unique activity during investigation. When a nation-state group\nmoves out of the DEV stage, we use chemical elements (for example, PHOSPHOROUS and\nNOBELIUM) to name them. On the other hand, we use volcano names (such as ELBRUS)\nfor ransomware or cybercriminal activity groups that have moved out of the DEV state. In the\ncybercriminal economy, relationships between groups change very rapidly. Attackers are\nknown to hire talent from other cybercriminal groups or use “contractors,” who provide gig\neconomy-style work on a limited time basis and may not rejoin the group. This shifting nature\nmeans that many of the groups Microsoft tracks are labeled as DEV, even if we have a\nconcrete understanding of the nature of the activity group.\n\n### DEV-0193 cluster (Trickbot LLC): The most prolific ransomware group today\n\n\n-----\n\nA vast amount of the current cybercriminal economy connects to a nexus of activity that\nMicrosoft tracks as DEV-0193, also referred to as Trickbot LLC. DEV-0193 is responsible for\ndeveloping, distributing, and managing many different payloads, including Trickbot,\nBazaloader, and AnchorDNS. In addition, DEV-0193 managed the Ryuk RaaS program\nbefore the latter’s shutdown in June 2021, and Ryuk’s successor, Conti as well as Diavol.\nMicrosoft has been tracking the activities of DEV-0193 since October 2020 and has observed\ntheir expansion from developing and distributing the Trickbot malware to becoming the most\nprolific ransomware-associated cybercriminal activity group active today.\n\nDEV-0193’s actions and use of the cybercriminal gig economy means they often add new\nmembers and projects and utilize contractors to perform various parts of their intrusions. As\nother malware operations have shut down for various reasons, including legal actions, DEV0193 has hired developers from these groups. Most notable are the acquisitions of\ndevelopers from Emotet, Qakbot, and IcedID, bringing them to the DEV-0193 umbrella.\n\nA subgroup of DEV-0193, which Microsoft tracks as DEV-0365, provides infrastructure-as-aservice for cybercriminals. Most notably, DEV-0365 provides Cobalt Strike Beacon-as-aservice. These DEV-0365 Beacons have replaced unique C2 infrastructure in many active\n[malware campaigns. DEV-0193 infrastructure has also been implicated in attacks deploying](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/15/analyzing-attacks-that-exploit-the-mshtml-cve-2021-40444-vulnerability/)\nnovel techniques, including exploitation of CVE-2021-40444.\n\nThe leaked chat files from a group publicly labeled as the “Conti Group” in February 2022\nconfirm the wide scale of DEV-0193 activity tracked by Microsoft. Based on our telemetry\nfrom 2021 and 2022, Conti has become one of the most deployed RaaS ecosystems, with\nmultiple affiliates concurrently deploying their payload—even as other RaaS ecosystems\n(DarkSide/BlackMatter and REvil) ceased operations. However, payload-based attribution\nmeant that much of the activity that led to Conti ransomware deployment was attributed to\nthe “Conti Group,” even though many affiliates had wildly different tradecraft, skills, and\nreporting structures. Some Conti affiliates performed small-scale intrusions using the tools\noffered by the RaaS, while others performed weeks-long operations involving data exfiltration\nand extortion using their own techniques and tools. One of the most prolific and successful\nConti affiliates—and the one responsible for developing the “Conti Manual” leaked in August\n2021—is tracked as DEV-0230. This activity group also developed and deployed the\nFiveHands and HelloKitty ransomware payloads and often gained access to an organization\nvia DEV-0193’s BazaLoader infrastructure.\n\n### ELBRUS: (Un)arrested development\n\nELBRUS, also known as FIN7, has been known to be in operation since 2012 and has run\nmultiple campaigns targeting a broad set of industries for financial gain. ELBRUS has\ndeployed point-of-sale (PoS) and ATM malware to collect payment card information from instore checkout terminals. They have also targeted corporate personnel who have access to\nsensitive financial data, including individuals involved in SEC filings.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In 2018, this activity group made headlines when three of its members were arrested. In May](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100)\n2020, another arrest was made for an individual with alleged involvement with ELBRUS.\nHowever, despite law enforcement actions against suspected individual members, Microsoft\nhas observed sustained campaigns from the ELBRUS group itself during these periods.\n\nELBRUS is responsible for developing and distributing multiple custom malware families\nused for persistence, including JSSLoader and Griffon. ELBRUS has also created fake\nsecurity companies called “Combi Security” and “Bastion Security” to facilitate the\nrecruitment of employees to their operations under the pretense of working as penetration\ntesters.\n\nIn 2020 ELBRUS transitioned from using PoS malware to deploying ransomware as part\nof a financially motivated extortion scheme, specifically deploying the MAZE and Revil RaaS\nfamilies. ELBRUS developed their own RaaS ecosystem named DarkSide. They deployed\nDarkSide payloads as part of their operations and recruited and managed affiliates that\ndeployed the DarkSide ransomware. The tendency to report on ransomware incidents based\non payload and attribute it to a monolithic gang often obfuscates the true relationship\nbetween the attackers, which is very accurate of the DarkSide RaaS. Case in point, one of\nthe most infamous DarkSide deployments wasn’t performed by ELBRUS but by a\nransomware-as-a-service affiliate Microsoft tracks as DEV-0289.\n\nELBRUS retired the DarkSide ransomware ecosystem in May 2021 and released its\nsuccessor, BlackMatter, in July 2021. Replicating their patterns from DarkSide,\nELBRUS deployed BlackMatter themselves and ran a RaaS program for affiliates. The\nactivity group then retired the BlackMatter ransomware ecosystem in November 2021.\n\nWhile they aren’t currently publicly observed to be running a RaaS program, ELBRUS is very\nactive in compromising organizations via phishing campaigns that lead to their JSSLoader\nand Griffon malware. Since 2019, ELBRUS has partnered with DEV-0324 to distribute their\nmalware implants. DEV-0324 acts as a distributor in the cybercriminal economy, providing a\nservice to distribute the payloads of other attackers through phishing and exploit kit vectors.\nELBRUS has also been abusing CVE-2021-31207 in Exchange to compromise organizations\nin April of 2022, an interesting pivot to using a less popular authenticated vulnerability in the\nProxyShell cluster of vulnerabilities. This abuse has allowed them to target organizations that\npatched only the unauthenticated vulnerability in their Exchange Server and turn\ncompromised low privileged user credentials into highly privileged access as SYSTEM on an\nExchange Server.\n\n### DEV-0504: Shifting payloads reflecting the rise and fall of RaaS programs\n\nAn excellent example of how clustering activity based on ransomware payload alone can\nlead to obfuscating the threat actors behind the attack is DEV-0504. DEV-0504 has deployed\nat least six RaaS payloads since 2020, with many of their attacks becoming high-profile\nincidents attributed to the “REvil gang” or “BlackCat ransomware group”. This attribution\n\n\n-----\n\nmasks the actions of the set of the attackers in the DEV-0504 umbrella, including other REvil\nand BlackCat affiliates. This has resulted in a confusing story of the scale of the ransomware\nproblem and overinflated the impact that a single RaaS program shutdown can have on the\nthreat environment.\n\nFigure 3. Ransomware payloads distributed by DEV-0504 between 2020 and April 2022\nDEV-0504 shifts payloads when a RaaS program shuts down, for example the deprecation of\nREvil and BlackMatter, or possibly when a program with a better profit margin appears.\nThese market dynamics aren’t unique to DEV-0504 and are reflected in most RaaS affiliates.\nThey can also manifest in even more extreme behavior where RaaS affiliates switch to older\n“fully owned” ransomware payloads like Phobos, which they can buy when a RaaS isn’t\navailable, or they don’t want to pay the fees associated with RaaS programs.\n\nDEV-0504 appears to rely on access brokers to enter a network, using Cobalt Strike\nBeacons they have possibly purchased access to. Once inside a network, they rely heavily\non PsExec to move laterally and stage their payloads. Their techniques require them to have\ncompromised elevated credentials, and they frequently disable antivirus products that aren’t\nprotected with tamper protection.\n\nDEV-0504 was responsible for deploying BlackCat ransomware in companies in the energy\nsector in January 2022. Around the same time, DEV-0504 also deployed BlackCat in attacks\nagainst companies in the fashion, tobacco, IT, and manufacturing industries, among others.\n\n### DEV-0237: Prolific collaborator\n\nLike DEV-0504, DEV-0237 is a prolific RaaS affiliate that alternates between different\npayloads in their operations based on what is available. DEV-0237 heavily used Ryuk and\nConti payloads from Trickbot LLC/DEV-0193, then Hive payloads more recently. Many\npublicly documented Ryuk and Conti incidents and tradecraft can be traced back to DEV0237.\n\nAfter the activity group switched to Hive as a payload, a large uptick in Hive incidents was\nobserved. Their switch to the BlackCat RaaS in March 2022 is suspected to be due to public\ndiscourse around Hive decryption methodologies; that is, DEV-0237 may have switched to\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackCat because they didn t want Hive s decryptors to interrupt their business. Overlap in\npayloads has occurred as DEV-0237 experiments with new RaaS programs on lower-value\ntargets. They have been observed to experiment with some payloads only to abandon them\nlater.\n\n_Figure 4. Ransomware payloads distributed by DEV-0237 between 2020 and April 2022_\nBeyond RaaS payloads, DEV-0237 uses the cybercriminal gig economy to also gain initial\naccess to networks. DEV-0237’s proliferation and success rate come in part from their\nwillingness to leverage the network intrusion work and malware implants of other groups\nversus performing their own initial compromise and malware development.\n\nFigure 5. Examples of DEV-0237’s relationships with other cybercriminal activity groups\nLike all RaaS operators, DEV-0237 relies on compromised, highly privileged account\ncredentials and security weaknesses once inside a network. DEV-0237 often leverages\nCobalt Strike Beacon dropped by the malware they have purchased, as well as tools like\nSharpHound to conduct reconnaissance. The group often utilizes BITSadmin /transfer to\nstage their payloads. An often-documented trademark of Ryuk and Conti deployments is\nnaming the ransomware payload xxx.exe, a tradition that DEV-0237 continues to use no\nmatter what RaaS they are deploying, as most recently observed with BlackCat. In late\nMarch of 2022, DEV-0237 was observed to be using a new version of Hive again.\n\n### DEV-0206 and DEV-0243: An “evil” partnership\n\n\n-----\n\nMalvertising, which refers to taking out a search engine ad to lead to a malware payload, has\nbeen used in many campaigns, but the access broker that Microsoft tracks as DEV-0206\nuses this as their primary technique to gain access to and profile networks. Targets are lured\nby an ad purporting to be a browser update, or a software package, to download a ZIP file\nand double-click it. The ZIP package contains a JavaScript file (.js), which in most\nenvironments runs when double-clicked. Organizations that have changed the settings such\nthat script files open with a text editor by default instead of a script handler are largely\nimmune from this threat, even if a user double clicks the script.\n\n[Once successfully executed, the JavaScript framework, also referred to SocGholish, acts as](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us)\na loader for other malware campaigns that use access purchased from DEV-0206, most\ncommonly Cobalt Strike payloads. These payloads have, in numerous instances, led to\ncustom Cobalt Strike loaders attributed to DEV-0243. DEV-0243 falls under activities tracked\nby the cyber intelligence industry as “EvilCorp,” The custom Cobalt Strike loaders are similar\n[to those seen in publicly documented Blister malware’s inner payloads. In DEV-0243’s initial](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-security-uncovers-blister-malware-campaign)\npartnerships with DEV-0206, the group deployed a custom ransomware payload known as\nWastedLocker, and then expanded to additional DEV-0243 ransomware payloads developed\nin-house, such as PhoenixLocker and Macaw.\n\nAround November 2021, DEV-0243 started to deploy the LockBit 2.0 RaaS payload in their\nintrusions. The use of a RaaS payload by the “EvilCorp” activity group is likely an attempt by\nDEV-0243 to avoid attribution to their group, which could discourage payment due to their\nsanctioned status.\n\nFigure 6. The handover from DEV-0206 to DEV-0243\n\n### DEV-0401: China-based lone wolf turned LockBit 2.0 affiliate\n\nDiffering from the other RaaS developers, affiliates, and access brokers profiled here, DEV0401 appears to be an activity group involved in all stages of their attack lifecycle, from initial\naccess to ransomware development. Despite this, they seem to take some inspiration from\n\n\n-----\n\nsuccessful RaaS operations with the frequent rebranding of their ransomware payloads.\nUnique among human-operated ransomware threat actors tracked by Microsoft, DEV-0401 is\nconfirmed to be a China-based activity group.\n\nDEV-0401 differs from many of the attackers who rely on purchasing access to existing\nmalware implants or exposed RDP to enter a network. Instead, the group heavily utilizes\nunpatched vulnerabilities to access networks, including vulnerabilities in Exchange, Manage\n[Engine AdSelfService Plus, Confluence, and Log4j 2. Due to the nature of the vulnerabilities](https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2022/cc-4002)\nthey preferred, DEV-0401 gains elevated credentials at the initial access stage of their\nattack.\n\nOnce inside a network, DEV-0401 relies on standard techniques such as using Cobalt Strike\nand WMI for lateral movement, but they have some unique preferences for implementing\nthese behaviors. Their Cobalt Strike Beacons are frequently launched via DLL search order\nhijacking. While they use the common Impacket tool for WMI lateral movement, they use a\ncustomized version of the wmiexec.py module of the tool that creates renamed output files,\nmost likely to evade static detections. Ransomware deployment is ultimately performed from\na batch file in a share and Group Policy, usually written to the NETLOGON share on a\nDomain Controller, which requires the attackers to have obtained highly privileged\ncredentials like Domain Administrator to perform this action.\n\nFigure 7. Ransomware payloads distributed by DEV-0401 between 2021 and April 2022\nBecause DEV-0401 maintains and frequently rebrands their own ransomware payloads, they\ncan appear as different groups in payload-driven reporting and evade detections and actions\nagainst them. Their payloads are sometimes rebuilt from existing for-purchase ransomware\ntools like Rook, which shares code similarity with the Babuk ransomware family. In February\nof 2022, DEV-0401 was observed deploying the Pandora ransomware family, primarily via\nunpatched VMware Horizon systems vulnerable to the Log4j 2 CVE-2021-44228\nvulnerability.\n\nLike many RaaS operators, DEV-0401 maintained a leak site to post exfiltrated data and\nmotivate victims to pay, however their frequent rebranding caused these systems to\nsometimes be unready for their victims, with their leak site sometimes leading to default web\n\n\n-----\n\nserver landing pages when victims attempt to pay. In a notable shift—possibly related to\nvictim payment issues—DEV-0401 started deploying LockBit 2.0 ransomware payloads in\nApril 2022.\n\n### DEV-0537: From extortion to destruction\n\nAn example of a threat actor who has moved to a pure extortion and destruction model\nwithout deploying ransomware payloads is an activity group that Microsoft tracks as DEV0537, also known as LAPSUS$. Microsoft has detailed DEV-0537 actions taken in early\n2022 [in this blog. DEV-0537 started targeting organizations mainly in Latin America but](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction/)\nexpanded to global targeting, including government entities, technology, telecom, retailers,\nand healthcare. Unlike more opportunistic attackers, DEV-0537 targets specific companies\nwith an intent. Their initial access techniques include exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in\ninternet-facing systems, searching public code repositories for credentials, and taking\nadvantage of weak passwords. In addition, there is evidence that DEV-0537 leverages\ncredentials stolen by the Redline password stealer, a piece of malware available for\npurchase in the cybercriminal economy. The group also buys credentials from underground\nforums which were gathered by other password-stealing malware.\n\nOnce initial access to a network is gained, DEV-0537 takes advantage of security\nmisconfigurations to elevate privileges and move laterally to meet their objectives of data\nexfiltration and extortion. While DEV-0537 doesn’t possess any unique technical capabilities,\nthe group is especially cloud-aware. They target cloud administrator accounts to set up\nforwarding rules for email exfiltration and tamper with administrative settings on cloud\nenvironments. As part of their goals to force payment of ransom, DEV-0537 attempts to\ndelete all server infrastructure and data to cause business disruption. To further facilitate the\nachievement of their goals, they remove legitimate admins and delete cloud resources and\nserver infrastructure, resulting in destructive attacks.\n\nDEV-0537 also takes advantage of cloud admin privileges to monitor email, chats, and VOIP\ncommunications to track incident response efforts to their intrusions. DEV-0537 has been\nobserved on multiple occasions to join incident response calls, not just observing the\nresponse to inform their attack but unmuting to demand ransom and sharing their screens\nwhile they delete their victim’s data and resources.\n\n## Defending against ransomware: Moving beyond protection by detection\n\nA durable security strategy against determined human adversaries must include the goal of\nmitigating classes of attacks and detecting them. Ransomware attacks generate multiple,\ndisparate security product alerts, but they could easily get lost or not responded to in time.\nAlert fatigue is real, and SOCs can make their lives easier by looking at trends in their alerts\nor grouping alerts into incidents so they can see the bigger picture. SOCs can then mitigate\n\n\n-----\n\nalerts using hardening capabilities like attack surface reduction rules. Hardening against\ncommon threats can reduce alert volume and stop many attackers before they get access to\nnetworks.\n\nAttackers tweak their techniques and have tools to evade and disable security products.\nThey are also well-versed in system administration and try to blend in as much as possible.\nHowever, while attacks have continued steadily and with increased impact, the attack\ntechniques attackers use haven’t changed much over the years. Therefore, a renewed focus\non prevention is needed to curb the tide.\n\nRansomware attackers are motivated by easy profits, so adding to their cost via security\nhardening is key in disrupting the cybercriminal economy.\n\n### Building credential hygiene\n\nMore than malware, attackers need credentials to succeed in their attacks. In almost all\nattacks where ransomware deployment was successful, the attackers had access to a\ndomain admin-level account or local administrator passwords that were consistent\nthroughout the environment. Deployment then can be done through Group Policy or tools like\nPsExec (or clones like PAExec, CSExec, and WinExeSvc). Without the credentials to provide\nadministrative access in a network, spreading ransomware to multiple systems is a bigger\nchallenge for attackers. Compromised credentials are so important to these attacks that\nwhen cybercriminals sell ill-gotten access to a network, in many instances, the price includes\na guaranteed administrator account to start with.\n\nCredential theft is a common attack pattern. Many administrators know tools like Mimikatz\nand LaZagne, and their capabilities to steal passwords from interactive logons in the LSASS\nprocess. Detections exist for these tools accessing the LSASS process in most security\nproducts. However, the risk of credential exposure isn’t just limited to a domain administrator\nlogging in interactively to a workstation. Because attackers have accessed and explored\nmany networks during their attacks, they have a deep knowledge of common network\nconfigurations and use it to their advantage. One common misconfiguration they exploit is\nrunning services and scheduled tasks as highly privileged service accounts.\n\nToo often, a legacy configuration ensures that a mission-critical application works by giving\nthe utmost permissions possible. Many organizations struggle to fix this issue even if they\nknow about it, because they fear they might break applications. This configuration is\nespecially dangerous as it leaves highly privileged credentials exposed in the LSA Secrets\nportion of the registry, which users with administrative access can access. In organizations\nwhere the local administrator rights haven’t been removed from end users, attackers can be\none hop away from domain admin just from an initial attack like a banking trojan. Building\ncredential hygiene is developing a logical segmentation of the network, based on privileges,\nthat can be implemented alongside network segmentation to limit lateral movement.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Here are some steps organizations can take to build credential hygiene:**\n\nAim to run services as Local System when administrative privileges are needed, as this\nallows applications to have high privileges locally but can’t be used to move laterally.\nRun services as Network Service when accessing other resources.\n[Use tools like LUA Buglight to determine the privileges that applications really need.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-blog-archive/lua-buglight-2-3-with-support-for-windows-8-1-and-windows-10/ba-p/701459)\n[Look for events with EventID 4624 where the logon type is 2, 4, 5, or 10 and the](https://twitter.com/jepayneMSFT/status/1012815189345857536)\naccount is highly privileged like a domain admin. This helps admins understand which\ncredentials are vulnerable to theft via LSASS or LSA Secrets. Ideally, any highly\nprivileged account like a Domain Admin shouldn’t be exposed on member servers or\nworkstations.\nMonitor for EventID 4625 (Logon Failed events) in Windows Event Forwarding when\nremoving accounts from privileged groups. Adding them to the local administrator\ngroup on a limited set of machines to keep an application running still reduces the\nscope of an attack as against running them as Domain Admin.\nRandomize Local Administrator passwords with a tool like Local Administrator\nPassword Solution (LAPS) to prevent lateral movement using local accounts with\nshared passwords.\nUse a [cloud-based identity security solution that leverages on-premises Active](https://docs.microsoft.com/defender-for-identity/what-is)\nDirectory signals get visibility into identity configurations and to identify and detect\nthreats or compromised identities\n\n### Auditing credential exposure\n\nAuditing credential exposure is critical in preventing ransomware attacks and cybercrime in\n[general. BloodHound is a tool that was originally designed to provide network defenders with](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)\ninsight into the number of administrators in their environment. It can also be a powerful tool\nin reducing privileges tied to administrative account and understanding your credential\nexposure. IT security teams and SOCs can work together with the authorized use of this tool\nto enable the reduction of exposed credentials. Any teams deploying BloodHound should\n[monitor it carefully for malicious use. They can also use this detection guidance to watch for](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/hunting-for-reconnaissance-activities-using-ldap-search-filters/ba-p/824726)\nmalicious use.\n\nMicrosoft has observed ransomware attackers also using BloodHound in attacks. When used\nmaliciously, BloodHound allows attackers to see the path of least resistance from the\nsystems they have access, to highly privileged accounts like domain admin accounts and\nglobal administrator accounts in Azure.\n\n### Prioritizing deployment of Active Directory updates\n\nSecurity patches for Active Directory should be applied as soon as possible after they are\nreleased. Microsoft has witnessed ransomware attackers adopting authentication\nvulnerabilities within one hour of being made public and as soon as those vulnerabilities are\nincluded in tools like Mimikatz. Ransomware activity groups also rapidly adopt vulnerabilities\n\n\n-----\n\nrelated to authentication, such as ZeroLogon and PetitPotam, especially when they are\nincluded in toolkits like Mimikatz. When unpatched, these vulnerabilities could allow\nattackers to rapidly escalate from an entrance vector like email to Domain Admin level\nprivileges.\n\n### Cloud hardening\n\nAs attackers move towards cloud resources, it’s important to secure cloud resources and\nidentities as well as on-premises accounts. Here are ways organizations can harden cloud\nenvironments:\n\n**Cloud identity hardening**\n\n[Implement the Azure Security Benchmark and general best practices for securing](https://docs.microsoft.com/security/benchmark/azure/)\nidentity infrastructure, including:\n\nPrevent on-premises service accounts from having direct rights to the cloud\nresources to prevent lateral movement to the cloud.\nEnsure that “break glass” account passwords are stored offline and configure\nhoney-token activity for account usage.\n[Implement Conditional Access policies enforcing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access) [Microsoft’s Zero Trust principles.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust)\n[Enable risk-based user sign-in protection and automate threat response to block high-](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-risk-based-sspr-mfa)\nrisk sign-ins from all locations and enable MFA for medium-risk ones.\n[Ensure that VPN access is protected via modern authentication methods.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-block-legacy-authentication#step-1-enable-modern-authentication-in-your-directory)\n\n**Multifactor authentication (MFA)**\n\nEnforce MFA on all accounts, remove users excluded from MFA, and strictly require\nMFA from all devices, in all locations, at all times.\nEnable passwordless authentication methods (for example, Windows Hello, FIDO keys,\nor Microsoft Authenticator) for accounts that support passwordless. For accounts that\nstill require passwords, use authenticator apps like Microsoft Authenticator for MFA.\nRefer to [this article for the different authentication methods and features.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)\n[Identify and secure workload identities to secure accounts where traditional MFA](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-workload-identity-risk)\nenforcement does not apply.\nEnsure that users are properly educated on not accepting unexpected two-factor\nauthentication (2FA).\nFor MFA that uses authenticator apps, ensure that the app requires a code to be typed\nin where possible, as many intrusions where MFA was enabled (including those by\nDEV-0537) still succeeded due to users clicking “Yes” on the prompt on their phones\n[even when they were not at their computers. Refer to](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match) [this article for an example.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)\n[Disable legacy authentication.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-block-legacy-authentication#moving-away-from-legacy-authentication)\n\n**Cloud admins**\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsure cloud admins/tenant admins are treated with the same level of security and\ncredential hygiene as Domain Admins.\n[Address gaps in authentication coverage.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-authentication-find-coverage-gaps)\n\n### Addressing security blind spots\n\nIn almost every observed ransomware incident, at least one system involved in the attack\nhad a misconfigured security product that allowed the attacker to disable protections or\nevade detection. In many instances, the initial access for access brokers is a legacy system\nthat isn’t protected by antivirus or EDR solutions. It’s important to understand that the lack\nsecurity controls on these systems that have access to highly privileged credentials act as\nblind spots that allow attackers to perform the entire ransomware and exfiltration attack chain\nfrom a single system without being detected. In some instances, this is specifically\nadvertised as a feature that access brokers sell.\n\nOrganizations should review and verify that security tools are running in their most secure\nconfiguration and perform regular network scans to ensure appropriate security products are\nmonitoring and protecting all systems, including servers. If this isn’t possible, make sure that\nyour legacy systems are either physically isolated through a firewall or logically isolated by\nensuring they have no credential overlap with other systems.\n\nFor Microsoft 365 Defender customers, the following checklist eliminates security blind spots:\n\nTurn on [cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus to cover rapidly](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)\nevolving attacker tools and techniques, block new and unknown malware variants, and\nenhance attack surface reduction rules and tamper protection.\nTurn on [tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection?view=o365-worldwide)\nservices.\n[Run EDR in block mode so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode?view=o365-worldwide)\nartifacts, even when a non-Microsoft antivirus doesn’t detect the threat or when\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode also\nblocks indicators identified proactively by Microsoft Threat Intelligence teams.\n[Enable network protection to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-network-protection?view=o365-worldwide)\ndomains and other malicious content on the internet.\n[Enable investigation and remediation in full automated mode to allow Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations?view=o365-worldwide)\nDefender for Endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches.\nUse [device discovery to increase visibility into the network by finding unmanaged](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/device-discovery?view=o365-worldwide)\ndevices and onboarding them to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\n[Protect user identities and credentials using Microsoft Defender for Identity, a cloud-](https://docs.microsoft.com/defender-for-identity/what-is)\nbased security solution that leverages on-premises Active Directory signals to monitor\nand analyze user behavior to identify suspicious user activities, configuration issues,\nand active attacks.\n\n### Reducing the attack surface\n\n\n-----\n\n[Microsoft 365 Defender customers can turn on attack surface reduction rules to prevent](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction?view=o365-worldwide)\ncommon attack techniques used in ransomware attacks. These rules, which can be\nconfigured by all Microsoft Defender Antivirus customers and not just those using the EDR\nsolution, offer significant hardening against attacks. In observed attacks from several\nransomware-associated activity groups, Microsoft customers who had the following rules\nenabled were able to mitigate the attack in the initial stages and prevented hands-onkeyboard activity:\n\n[In addition, Microsoft has changed the default behavior of Office applications to block macros](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/security/internet-macros-blocked)\nin files from the internet, further reduce the attack surface for many human-operated\nransomware attacks and other threats.\n\n### Hardening internet-facing assets and understanding your perimeter\n\nOrganizations must identify and secure perimeter systems that attackers might use to access\n[the network. Public scanning interfaces, such as RiskIQ, can be used to augment data.](https://www.riskiq.com/what-is-attack-surface-management/)\nSome systems that should be considered of interest to attackers and therefore need to be\nhardened include:\n\nSecure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Windows Virtual Desktop endpoints with\nMFA to harden against password spray or brute force attacks.\nBlock Remote IT management tools such as Teamviewer, Splashtop, Remote\nManipulator System, Anydesk, Atera Remote Management, and ngrok.io via network\nblocking such as perimeter firewall rules if not in use in your environment. If these\nsystems are used in your environment, enforce security settings where possible to\nimplement MFA.\n\nRansomware attackers and access brokers also use unpatched vulnerabilities, whether\nalready disclosed or zero-day, especially in the initial access stage. Even older vulnerabilities\nwere implicated in ransomware incidents in 2022 because some systems remained\nunpatched, partially patched, or because access brokers had established persistence on a\npreviously compromised systems despite it later being patched.\n\nSome observed vulnerabilities used in campaigns between 2020 and 2022 that defenders\ncan check for and mitigate include:\n\nCitrix ADC systems affected by [CVE-2019-19781](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19781)\n[Pulse Secure VPN systems affected by](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-110a) [CVE-2019-11510,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11510) [CVE-2020-8260,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8260) CVE-20208243, [CVE-2021-22893,](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44784/) [CVE-2021-22894,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22894) [CVE-2021-22899, and](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22899) [CVE-2021-22900](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22900)\nSonicWall SSLVPN affected by [CVE-2021-20016](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-20016)\nMicrosoft SharePoint servers affected by [CVE-2019-0604](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us/vulnerability/CVE-2019-0604)\n[Unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/released-may-2021-exchange-server-security-updates/ba-p/2335209)\nZoho ManageEngine systems affected by [CVE-2020-10189](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10189)\nFortiGate VPN servers affected by [CVE-2018-13379](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13379)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Apache log4j CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)\n\n[Ransomware attackers also rapidly adopt new vulnerabilities.
