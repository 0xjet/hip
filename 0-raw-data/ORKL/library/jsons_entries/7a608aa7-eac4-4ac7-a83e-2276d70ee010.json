    "plain_text": "# Myanmar – Multi-stage malware attack targets elected lawmakers\n\n**qurium.org/alerts/targeted-malware-against-crph/**\n\n**_March 11, 2021 (Updated April 29, 2021)_**\n\n**The 11th of March 2021, a mail containing a targeted attack was sent to a member of**\n**the** **[Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH). The CRPH is formed by](https://crphmyanmar.org/)**\n**elected lawmakers who were prevented from taking seats in the Union Parliament by**\n**the military coup of the 1st of February 2021. The Pyidaungsu Hluttaw is Myanmar’s**\n**Union Parliament.**\n\nThe malicious mail sent to CRPH contained a Sender and Subject customized for the victim,\nand the mail body included a link to a document in a Google Drive of the form\nhxxps://drive.google.com/file/…\n\nThe mail included a link to a rar file located in a\n\nGoogle Drive account.\nThe RAR compressed file hosted in the Google Drive contained a .lnk file with the name\n2021-03-11.lnk\n\nOnce executed the following files are dropped.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n0639b0a6f69b3265c1e42227d650b7d1 aaa.exe\n7f0079d2ef1fca0b4bf0789aad3d2b04 gtgc.bat\n8b68dc5dbb99af7de3312771e828b6c8 gtgc.js\n332a4f864b1f7b1e166edb5d9b47e119 gtgc.lnk\n155de7d464125b8c35b22dae37428aba SmadavProtect32.exe\n37d1df5648c2e499b23b4228743f0318 SmadHook32c.dll\n\n```\nThese files are the result\n\nof the execution of the .lnk bundle.\n[The malware drops a legitimate copy of SmadavProtect32, a popular](https://www.pconlife.com/download/otherfile/29372/155de7d464125b8c35b22dae37428aba/) [anti-virus installed in](https://www.smadav.net/?page=about&lang=en)\nbrand new computers in the country.\n\nTo avoid anti-virus detection the malware executes the anti-virus SmadavProtect32 but it\nalso provides a dynamic library with it (SmadHook32c.dll). The DLL is loaded when\nSmadavProtect32 is executed providing to the malware the functionality for the next stage of\ninfection.\n\nThe next stage is a HTTP connection to IP address 95.217.1{.}81. to request\nhttp://95.217.1{.}81/maps/overlayBFPR where a binary encrypted payload is downloaded.\n```\n725f28750887fbe4652c39ceeecdac21 payload\n\n```\n[The methods and Command and Control are associated to activities performed by the](https://www.virustotal.com/graph/g17976b3a233d4320a61c61831c619a1efba14b89682d4ee39462ce7b8143f3c2)\n[Chinese APT Group “Mustang Panda“.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/mustang_panda)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same Command and Control (C2) was used in another targeted attack in December\n2020, carried out by Mustang Panda (Credit: Virustotal Intelligence).\n\n## Update April 2021\n\nDuring the last week of April 2021, a new email was sent to a mailing list, the mail contained\na link to Google Drive with the file: CEC List & CRPH (Meeting minutes).rar\n\nThe compressed RAR file contained two files\n\n1d281c5353d1b12afb9c4a4ae61e5675 CEC List & CRPH (Meeting minutes) .exe\nac18992de804cb4bc9e6aa7f7e3ad08e Acrobat.dll\n\nThe first file is legitimate copy of exch_acrobat.exe and the second file is a malicious DLL\nlibrary included by the attacker. As in the previous attack the DLL library is used to “sideload” the malware.\n\nTo ensure that the malware remains active in the compromised system, it will include a new\nschedule task (MicrosoftCorp.xml) pointing to\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\ACMguid\\Acrobat.exe and will add a new registry key in\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ACMguid\n\nIn a second stage of infection the malware connects to 65.21.111{.}255/maps/overlayBFPR\nto download a Cobalt Strike beacon. A great video explaining Cobaltstrike capabilities is\n[available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOY9pXxzLm8)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn conclusion, this attack reassembles the techniques used by the previous loader described\nin this article and suggests that the same attacker is behind the malware.\n\n\n-----",
