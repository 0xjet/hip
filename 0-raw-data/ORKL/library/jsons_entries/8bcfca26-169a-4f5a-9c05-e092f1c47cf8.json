Center\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-hits-lithuanias-national-public-health-center/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-hits-lithuanias-national-public-health-center/)**\n\nSergiu Gatlan\n\nBy\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nDecember 30, 2020\n11:02 AM\n0\n\nThe internal networks of Lithuania's National Center for Public Health (NVSC) and several\nmunicipalities have been infected with Emotet malware following a large campaign targeting\nthe country's state institutions.\n\n\"When infected recipients opened infected messages, the virus entered the internal networks\n[of the institutions,\" NVSC officials said in a statement published today.](https://nvsc.lrv.lt/lt/naujienos/siunciant-dideli-kieki-virusu-uzkrestu-elektroniniu-laisku-antra-karta-si-rudeni-bandoma-pakenkti-valstybes-institucijoms)\n\n\"Infected computers, after downloading additional files, began sending fake emails or\nengaging in other types of malicious activity.\"\n\nLithuanian government officials, ministry representatives, and epidemiological diagnostics\nexperts that have previously been contacted by NVSC specialists via email have all received\nEmotet-infected emails from infected systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NVSC e-mail systems have been temporarily shut down on Tuesday to stop the further\nspread of the virus.\n\nNVSC information technology specialists, together with experts from the Central State\nTelecommunications Center and the National Cyber  Security Center currently working on\ncleaning affected systems of the Emotet infection, as well as on recovering NVSC e-mails\nand restoring email access.\n\n## Emails sent as replies to previous conversations\n\nRytis Rainys, Director of the Lithuanian National Cyber  Security Center (NKSC), warned that\nthe Emotet emails sent as replies to previous conversations distributed malicious code using\npassword-protected archives as attachments, with the password shared in the email body.\n\nThis prevented anti-malware solutions from detecting the malicious emails which made it\npossible for the targeted individuals to open the attachment and infect themselves.\n\nStealing reply-chain emails is a known Emotet tactic used to camouflage malicious emails as\nparts of existing conversations for higher credibility and better infection rates in future spam\ncampaigns.\n\n[The tactic is also being used by the Qbot trojan, and it was previously by the Gozi ISFB](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-steals-your-email-threads-again-to-infect-other-victims/)\nbanking trojan and the [URSNIF information-stealing trojan.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/phishing-campaign-uses-hijacked-emails-to-deliver-ursnif-by-replying-to-ongoing-threads/)\n\nThis is the second large Emotet campaign that has targeted Lithuania this year, with a\nprevious one detected by the NKSC in October.\n\n[The NKSC published an advisory at the time recommending potential targets (including but](https://www.nksc.lt/naujienos/sparciai_plinta_laiskai_su_kenksmingu_programiniu_.html)\nnot limited to state institutions and companies) to enable and properly configure Sender\nPolicy Framework (SPF) email authentication.\n\n## Emotet is back in business\n\n[After a break of a month and a half, the Emotet botnet was revived on December 21st [1,](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1340995938031194113) [2],](https://twitter.com/anyrun_app/status/1340996400071528448?s=20)\n[and Microsoft spotted an ongoing campaign delivering \"a wide range of lures in massive](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1344028100749713409)\nvolumes of emails, the use of fake replies or forwarded emails, password-protected archive\nattachments.\"\n\n\"The new Emotet campaign still uses documents that contain malicious macro that, when\nenabled, connects to seven malicious domains to download the Emotet payload,\" Microsoft\nSecurity Intelligence tweeted.\n\n[Emotet was first spotted in 2014 as a banking Trojan and has now evolved into a botnet used](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/emotet/)\n[by the TA542 threat group (aka Mummy Spider) to deploy second-stage malware payloads](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/mummy_spider)\non infected systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payloads Emotet drops on compromised computers include the QakBot and Trickbot\n(which also deploys both Ryuk and Conti ransomware) trojans.\n\n[Before going on a break, Emotet has targeted multiple US state and local governments in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-emotet-increasing-attacks-on-us-state-local-governments/)\npotentially targeted campaigns according to an advisory published by DHS-CISA in October.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Historic Hotel Stay, Complementary Emotet Exposure
