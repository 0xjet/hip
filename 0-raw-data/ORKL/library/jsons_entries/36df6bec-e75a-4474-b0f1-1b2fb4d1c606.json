    "plain_text": "##### y g, p\n\nAs a part of our Kaspersky APT Intelligence Reporting subscription,\n\ncustomers received an update in mid-February 2017 on some interesting\n\nAPT activity that we called WhiteBear. Much of the contents of that report\n\nare reproduced here. WhiteBear is a parallel project or second stage of\n\nthe Skipper Turla cluster of activity documented in another private\n\nintelligence report “Skipper Turla – the White Atlas framework” from mid\n2016. Like previous Turla activity, WhiteBear leverages compromised\n\nwebsites and hijacked satellite connections for command and control\n\n(C2) infrastructure. As a matter of fact, WhiteBear infrastructure has\n\noverlap with other Turla campaigns, like those deploying Kopiluwak, as\n\ndocumented in “KopiLuwak – A New JavaScript Payload from Turla” in\n\nDecember 2016. WhiteBear infected systems maintained a dropper (which\n\nwas typically signed) as well as a complex malicious platform which was\n\nalways preceded by WhiteAtlas module deployment attempts. However,\n\ndespite the similarities to previous Turla campaigns, we believe that\n\nWhiteBear is a distinct project with a separate focus. We note that this\n\nobservation of delineated target focus, tooling, and project context is an\n\ninteresting one that also can be repeated across broadly labeled Turla and\n\nSofacy activity.\n\nFrom February to September 2016, WhiteBear activity was narrowly\n\nfocused on embassies and consular operations around the world. All of\n\nthese early WhiteBear targets were related to embassies and\n\ndiplomatic/foreign affair organizations. Continued WhiteBear activity later\n\nshifted to include defense-related organizations into June 2017. When\n\ncompared to WhiteAtlas infections, WhiteBear deployments are relatively\n\nrare and represent a departure from the broader Skipper Turla target set.\n\nAdditionally, a comparison of the WhiteAtlas framework to WhiteBear\n\ncomponents indicates that the malware is the product of separate\n\ndevelopment efforts. WhiteBear infections appear to be preceded by a\n\ncondensed spearphishing dropper, lack Firefox extension installer\n\npayloads, and contain several new components signed with a new code\n\nsigning digital certificate, unlike WhiteAtlas incidents and modules.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe exact delivery vector for WhiteBear components is unknown to us,\n\nalthough we have very strong suspicion the group spearphished targets\n\nwith malicious pdf files. The decoy pdf document above was likely stolen\n\nfrom a target or partner. And, although WhiteBear components have been\n\nconsistently identified on a subset of systems previously targeted with the\n\nWhiteAtlas framework, and maintain components within the same\n\nfilepaths and can maintain identical filenames, we were unable to firmly\n\ntie delivery to any specific WhiteAtlas component. WhiteBear focused on\n\nvarious embassies and diplomatic entities around the world in early 2016\n\n– tellingly, attempts were made to drop and display decoy pdf’s with full\n\ndiplomatic headers and content alongside executable droppers on target\n\nsystems.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe WhiteBear platform implements an elaborate set of messaging and\n\ninjection components to support full presence on victim hosts. A diagram\n\nhelps to visualize the reach of injected components on the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n## WhiteBear Binary loader\n\nSample MD5: b099b82acb860d9a9a571515024b35f0\n\nType PE EXE\n\nCompilation timestamp 2002.02.05 17:36:10 (GMT)\n\nLinker version 10.0 (MSVC 2010)\n\nSignature “Solid Loop Ldt” UTCTime 15/10/2015 00:00:00 GMT –\n\nUTCTime 14/10/2016 23:59:59 GMT\n\nThe WhiteBear binary loader maintains several features including two\n\ninjection methods for its (oddly named) “KernelInjector” subsystem, also\n\nnamed by its developer\n\n##### – Standart\n\n– WindowInject (includes an unusual technique for remotely placing code\n\ninto memory for subsequent thread execution)\n\nThe loader also maintains two methods for privilege and DEP process\n\nprotection handling:\n\n– GETSID_METHOD_1\n\n– GETSID_METHOD_2\n\nThe binary contains two resources:\n\n– BINARY 201\n\n– File size: 128 bytes\n\n– Contains the string, “explorer.exe”\n\n– BINARY 202\n\n– File size: 403456 bytes\n\n– File Type: PE file (this is the actual payload and is not encrypted)\n\n– This PE file resource stores the “main orchestrator” .dll file\n\n#### Loader runtime flow\n\n\n-----\n\n279F2F592CC7}”, and waits up to two minutes if it is already present while\n\nlogging the message “IsLoaderAlreadyWork +”. The loader creates the\n\nmutex “{531511FA-190D-5D85-8A4A-279F2F592CC7}”, and waits up to\n\ntwo minutes. If it is already present while logging the message\n\n“IsLoaderAlreadyWork +”, it extracts the resource BINARY 201. This\n\nresource contains a wide string name of processes to inject into (i.e.\n\n“explorer.exe”).\n\nThe loader makes a pipe named:\n\n\\\\.\\pipe\\Winsock2\\CatalogChangeListener-%03x%01x-%01x\n\nWhere the “%x” parameter is replaced with the values 0xFFFFFFFF\n\n0xEEEEEEEE 0xDDDDDDDD, or if it has successfully obtained the user’s\n\nSID:\n\n\\\\.\\pipe\\Winsock2\\CatalogChangeListener-%02x%02x-%01x\n\nWith “%x” parameters replaced with numbers calculated from the current\n\ndate and a munged user SID.\n\nThe pipe is used to communicate with the target process and the\n\ntransport module; the running code also reads its own image body and\n\nwrites it to the pipe. The loader then obtains the payload body from\n\nresource BINARY 202. It finds the running process that matches the target\n\nname, copies the buffer containing the payload into the process, then\n\nstarts its copy in the target process.\n\nThere are some interesting, juvenile, and non-native English-speaker\n\ndebug messages compiled into the code:\n\n– i cunt waiting anymore #%d\n\n– lights aint turnt off with #%d\n\n– Not find process\n\n– CMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_NO_CONNECT_TO_GAYZER\n\n– CMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_TAKE_LAST_CONNECTION\n\n– CMessageProcessingSystem::Send_TAKE_FIN\n\n## WhiteBear Main module/orchestrator\n\nSample MD5: 06bd89448a10aa5c2f4ca46b4709a879\n\nType, size: PE DLL, 394 kb\n\nCompilation timestamp: 2002.02.05 17:31:28 (GMT)\n\nLinker version: 10.0 (MSVC 2010)\n\nUnsigned Code\n\nThe main module has no exports, only a DllMain entry which spawns one\n\nthread and returns. The main module maintains multiple BINARY\n\nresources that include executable configurations and encryption data:\n\n\n-----\n\n102 – RSA public key\n\n103 – empty\n\n104 – 16 encrypted bytes\n\n105 – location (“%HOMEPATH%\\ntuser.dat.LOG3”)\n\n106 – process names (e.g. “iexplore.exe, firefox.exe, chrome.exe,\n\noutlook.exe, safari.exe, opera.exe”) to inject into\n\n107 – Transport module for interaction with C&C\n\n108 – C2 configuration\n\n109 – Registry location\n\n(“\\HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsNT\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Scr\n\neen Saver”)\n\n110 – no information\n\n111 – 8 zero bytes\n\nValues 104 – 111 are encrypted with the RSA private key (resource 101)\n\nand compressed with bzip2.4. The RSA key is stored with header stripped\n\nin a format similar to Microsoft’s PVK; the RSA PRIVATE KEY header is\n\nappended by the loader before reading the keys into the encryption code.\n\nResource 109 points to a registry location called “external storage”, built\nin resources are called “PE Storage”.\n\nIn addition to storing code, crypto resources, and configuration data in PE\n\nresources, WhiteBear copies much of this data to the victim host’s\n\nregistry. Registry storage is located in the following keys. Subkeys and\n\nstored values listed below:\n\n[HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\ScreenS\n\naver] [HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\n\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\ScreenSaver]\n\nRegistry subkeys:\n\n{629336E3-58D6-633B-5182-576588CF702A} Contains the RSA private\n\nkey used to encrypt/decrypt other resources / resource 101\n\n{3CDC155D-398A-646E-1021-23047D9B4366} Resource 105 – current\n\nfile location\n\n{81A03BF8-60AA-4A56-253C-449121D61CAF} Resource 106 – process\n\nnames\n\n{31AC34A1-2DE2-36AC-1F6E-86F43772841F} Contains the internet C&C\n\ntransport module / resource 107\n\n{8E9810C5-3014-4678-27EE-3B7A7AC346AF} Resource 108 – C&C\n\nconfig\n\n{28E74BDA-4327-31B0-17B9-56A66A818C1D} Resource 110 “plugins”\n\n{4A3130BD-2608-730F-31A7-86D16CE66100} Resource 111\n\n{119D263D-68FC-1942-3CA3-46B23FA652A0} Unique Guid (“ObjectID”)\n\n{1DC12691-2B24-2265-435D-735D3B118A70} “Task Queue”\n\n{6CEE6FE1-10A2-4C33-7E7F-855A51733C77} “Result Queue”\n\n\n-----\n\n{831511FA-190D-5D85-8A4A-279F2F592CC7} unknown\n\nFinally, if the main WhiteBear module fails to use registry storage, it uses\n\n“FS Storage” in file %TEMP%\\KB943729.log. The module reads all of its\n\ndata and binary components from one of the storages and then verifies\n\nthe integrity of data (RSA+bzip2 compression+signature).\n\nThe module maintains functionality which is divided into a set of\n\nsubsystems that are loosely named by the developers:\n\n- result queue\n\n- task queue\n\n- message processing system\n\n- autorun manager\n\n- execution subsystem\n\n- inject manager\n\n- PEStorage\n\n- local transport manager/internal transport channel\n\nIt creates the following temporary files:\n\n%TEMP%\\CVRG72B5.tmp.cvr\n\n%TEMP%\\CVRG1A6B.tmp.cvr\n\n%TEMP%\\CVRG38D9.tmp.cvr\n\n%TEMP%\\~DF1E05.tmp contains the updated body of the loader during\n\nan update.\n\nEvery day (as specified by local time) the main module restarts the\n\ntransport subsystem which includes:\n\n- message processing\n\n- named pipe transport (“NPTransport”)\n\nIf the registry/file storage is empty, the module performs a ‘migration’ of\n\nhardcoded modules and settings to the storage location. This data is\n\nencrypted with a new RSA key (which is also stored in the registry).\n\nThe data in the registry is prepended with a 0xC byte header. The\n\nmaximum size of each registry item is 921,600 bytes; if the maximum size\n\nis exceeded, it is split into several items. The format of the header is\n\nshown below:\n\n[4:service DWORD][4:chunk index][4:chunk size including header]\n\nEvery time the orchestrator module is loaded it validates that the storage\n\narea contains the appropriate data and that all of the components can be\n\ndecrypted and validated. If these checks fail the module reinstalls a\n\nconfiguration from the resource “REINSTALL”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe module generates the pipe name (with the same prefix as the loader);\n\nwaits for incoming connections; receives data and pushes it to the\n\n‘message processing system’. The module generates the pipe name (with\n\nthe same prefix as the loader); waits for incoming connections; receives\n\ndata and pushes it to the ‘message processing system’. Every packet is\n\nexpected to be at least 6 bytes and contain the following header:   [4:ID]\n\n[2:command]\n\nList of commands:\n\n1 : new task\n\n2 : update the loader + orchestrator file\n\n4 : send task result\n\n5 : send settings\n\n6 : write results to registry/file storage\n\n7 : enable / disable c2 transport / update status\n\n8 : uninstall\n\n9 : nop\n\n10 : “CMessageProcessingSystem::Receive_NO_CONNECT_TO_GAYZER”;\n\nwrite results to registry\n\n11: write the last connection data ‘{56594FEA-5774-746D-4496\n6361266C40D0}’ aka “last connection” storage value\n\n12: “give cache” – write cached commands from the C&C\n\n13: “take cache” – append C&C commands to the cache\n\nDepending on the command, the module returns the results from\n\npreviously run tasks, the configuration of the module, or a confirmation\n\nmessage.\n\nAn example of these tasks is shown below:\n\n- write a file and execute it with CreateProcess() capturing all of the\n\nstandard output\n\n- update C&C configuration, plugin storage, etc\n\n- update autoruns\n\n- write arbitrary files to the filesystem (“File Upload”)\n\n- read arbitrary files from the filesystem (“File Download”)\n\n- update itself\n\n- uninstall\n\n- push task results to C2 servers\n\nThe “LocalTransport manager” handles named pipe communication and\n\nidentifies if the packet received is designated to the current instance or to\n\nsomeone else (down the route). In the latter scenario the LocalTansport\n\nmanager re-encrypts the packet, serializes it (again), and pushes the\n\npacket via a named pipe on the local network to another hop,\n\n\n-----\n\nrouter.\n\nThe Autorun manager subsystem is responsible for tracking the way that\n\nthe malicious module starts in the system and it maintains several\n\ndifferent methods for starting automatically (shown below):\n\nLinkAutorun The subsystem searches for a LNK file in the target directory,\n\nchanges the path to “cmd.exe” and the description to ‘ /q /c start “” “%s”\n\n&& start “” “%s” ‘\n\nTaskScheduler20Autorun The subsystem creates the ITaskService (works\n\nonly on Windows Vista+) and uses the ITaskService interface to create a\n\nnew task with a logon trigger\n\nStartupAutorun The subsystem creates a LNK file in %STARTUP%\n\nScreenSaverAutorun The subsystem installs as a current screensaver with\n\na hidden window\n\nHiddenTaskAutorun The subsystem creates the task ITaskScheduler\n\n(works only on pre-Vista NT). The task trigger start date is set to the\n\ncreation date of the Windows directory\n\nShellAutorun Winlogon registry [HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\n\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon] Shell=”explorer.exe, …”\n\nFile Uninstallation is done in a discreet manner. The file is filled with\n\nzeroes, then renamed to a temporary filename before being deleted\n\n## WhiteBear Transport library (aka “Internet Relations”, “Pipe Relations”)\n\nSample MD5: 19ce5c912768958aa3ee7bc19b2b032c\n\nType: PE DLL\n\nLinker timestamp: 2002.02.05 17:58:22 (GMT)\n\nLinker version: 10.0\n\nSignature “Solid Loop Ldt” UTCTime 15/10/2015 00:00:00 GMT –\n\nUTCTime 14/10/2016 23:59:59 GMT\n\nThis transport library does not appear on disk in its PE format. It is\n\nmaintained as encrypted resource 107 in the orchestrator module, then\n\ndecrypted and loaded by the orchestrator directly into the memory of the\n\ntarget process. This C2 interaction module is independent, once started, it\n\ninteracts with the orchestrator using its local named pipe.\n\nTo communicate with its C2 server, the transport library uses the system\n\nuser agent or default “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0)”.\n\nBefore attempting a connection with its configured C2 server, the module\n\nchecks if the victim system is connected to Internet by sending HTTP 1.1\n\n\n-----\n\n- update.microsoft.com\n\n- microsoft.com\n\n- windowsupdate.microsoft.com\n\n- yahoo.com\n\n- google.com\n\nIf there is no Internet connection available, the module changes state to,\n\n“CANNOT_WORK” and notifies the peer by sending command “7” over the\n\nlocal pipe.\n\nThe C2 configuration is obtained from the main module with the\n\ncommand “5”. This checks whether the module complies with the\n\nschedule specified in the C2 settings (which includes inactivity time and\n\nthe interval between connections). The C2 interaction stages have\n\ninteresting function names and an odd misspelling, indicating that the\n\ndeveloper may not be a native English speaker (or may have learned the\n\nEnglish language in a British setting):\n\n“InternetRelations::GetInetConnectToGazer”\n\n“InternetRelations::ReceiveMessageFromCentre”\n\n“InternetRelations::SendMessageToCentre”\n\n“PipeRelations::CommunicationTpansportPipe”\n\nThe module writes the encrypted log to %TEMP%\\CVRG38D9.tmp.cvr The\n\nmodule sends a HTTP 1.0 GET request through a randomly generated\n\npath to the C2 server. The server’s reply is expected to have its MD5\n\nchecksum appended to the packet. If C2 interaction fails, the module\n\nsends the command “10” (“NO_CONNECT_TO_GAYZER”) to the\n\norchestrator.\n\n## Unusual WhiteBear Encryption\n\nThe encryption implemented in the WhiteBear orchestrator is particularly\n\ninteresting. We note that the resource section is encrypted/decrypted and\n\npacked/decompressed with RSA+3DES+BZIP2. This implementation is\n\nunique and includes the format of the private key as stored in the\n\nresource section. 3DES is present in Sofacy and Duqu2 components,\n\nhowever they are missing in this Microsoft-centric RSA encryption\n\ntechnique. The private key format used in this schema and RSA crypto\n\ncombination with 3DES is (currently) unique to this threat actor.\n\nThe private key itself is stored as a raw binary blob, in a format similar to\n\nthe one Microsoft code uses in PVK format. This format is not officially\n\ndocumented, but its structures and handling are coded into OpenSSL.\n\nThis private key value is stored in the orchestrator resources without valid\n\nheaders. The orchestrator code prepends valid headers and passes the\n\n\n-----\n\n## g g g Fictional Corporation or Assumed Identity?\n\nMost WhiteBear samples are signed with a valid code signing certificate\n\nissued for “Solid Loop Ltd”, a once-registered British organization. Solid\n\nLoop is likely a phony front organization or a defunct organization and\n\nactors assumed its identity to abuse the name and trust, in order to attain\n\ndeceptive code-signing digital certificates.\n\n## WhiteBear Command and Control\n\nThe WhiteBear C2 servers are consistent with long standing Turla\n\ninfrastructure management practices, so the backdoors callback to a mix\n\nof compromised servers and hijacked destination satellite IP hosts. For\n\nexample, direct, hardcoded Turla satellite IP C2 addresses are shown\n\nbelow:\n\nC2 IP Address        Geolocation              IP Space\n\nOwner\n\n169.255.137[.]203     South Sudan              IPTEC, VSAT\n\n217.171.86[.]137      Congo                   Global\n\nBroadband Solution, Kinshasa VSAT\n\n66.178.107[.]140      Unknown – Likely Africa     SES/New\n\nSkies Satellites\n\n## Targeting and Victims\n\nWhiteBear targets over the course of a couple years are related to\n\ngovernment foreign affairs, international organizations, and later, defense\n\norganizations. The geolocation of the incidents are below:\n\n\n-----\n\nSouth Asia\n\nCentral Asia\n\nEast Asia\n\nSouth America\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWhiteBear activity reliant on this toolset seems to have diminished in June\n\n2017. But Turla efforts continue to be run as multiple subgroups and\n\ncampaigns. This one started targeting diplomatic entities and later\n\nincluded defense related organizations. Infrastructure overlap with other\n\nTurla campaigns, code artifacts, and targeting are consistent with past\n\nTurla efforts. With this subset of 2016-2017 WhiteBear activity, Turla\n\ncontinues to be one of the most prolific, longstanding, and advanced APT\n\nwe have researched, and continues to be the subject of much of our\n\nresearch.
