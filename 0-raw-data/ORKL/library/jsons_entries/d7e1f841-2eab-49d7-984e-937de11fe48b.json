We mostly observe attacks using**\n\n**Elirks occurring in East Asia. One of the unique features of the malware is that it retrieves its C2**\n\n**address by accessing a pre-determined microblog service or SNS. Attackers create accounts on**\n\n**those services and post encoded IP addresses or the domain names of real C2 servers in**\n\n**advance of distributing the backdoor. We have seen multiple Elirks variants using Japanese blog**\n\n**services for the last couple of years. Figure 1 shows embedded URL in an Elirks sample found**\n\n**in early 2016.**\n\n**_Figure 1 Embedded URLs in Elirks variant_**\n\n**In another sample found in 2014, an attacker used a Japanese blog service.

Figure 7 shows**\n\n**PDF file named “Airline Reservation Numbers (updated version).pdf”.

However, we can see**\n\n**some resemblances between the two attacks. In both cases, attackers used the same malware**\n\n**family, crafted spear phishing emails in a similar manner, and seem to be interested in some**\n\n**areas related to aviation. We have been seeing multiple Elirks variants targeting Japan in the**\n\n**last few years, potentially indicating an ongoing cyber espionage campaign.
