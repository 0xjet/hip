There\n[have been several](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/) [reports detailing the exploitation of these vulnerabilities by Iranian state](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/11/15/exchange-exploit-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/)\nsponsored threat actors, among them the Phosphorus APT group carrying out ransomware\nattacks.\n\nCybereason researchers recently discovered a new set of tools which were developed by the\nPhosphorus group and incorporated into their arsenal, including a novel PowerShell\nbackdoor dubbed PowerLess Backdoor. Our research also highlights a stealthy technique\nused by the group to avoid PowerShell detection by running the PowerShell Backdoor in a\n.NET context rather than spawning the PowerShell process.\n\nIn addition, several interesting connections were found between the Phosphorus group and\nthe [Memento Ransomware that first emerged in late 2021. (Related Iranian APT research:](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/11/18/new-ransomware-actor-uses-password-protected-archives-to-bypass-encryption-protection/)\n[StrifeWater RAT: Iranian APT Moses Staff Adds New Trojan to Ransomware Operations).](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/strifewater-rat-iranian-apt-moses-staff-adds-new-trojan-to-ransomware-operations)\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**Novel PowerShell Backdoor: A novel and previously undocumented PowerShell**\nbackdoor related to the Phosphorus group was discovered by the Cybereason\nNocturnus Team and dubbed PowerLess Backdoor. It supports downloading additional\npayloads, such as a keylogger and an info stealer.\n\n**Evasive PowerShell Execution: The PowerShell code runs in the context of a .NET**\napplication, thus not launching “powershell.exe” which enables it to evade security\nproducts.\n\n**Modular Malware: The toolset analyzed includes extremely modular, multi-staged**\nmalware that decrypts and deploys additional payloads in several stages for the sake\nof both stealth and efficacy.\n\n**Highly Active Infrastructure: At the time of writing this report, some of the IOCs**\nremained active delivering new payloads.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Wide Range of Open Source Tools: A lot of the activity observed involved a variety of**\npublicly available tools, such as cryptography libraries, weaponizing them for payloads\nand communication encryption.\n\n**Shared IOCs with Memento Ransomware: One of the IP addresses serves a domain**\nwhich is being used as command and control (C2) for the recently discovered Memento\nRansomware.\n\n**Phosphorus Threat Group: The Phosphorus Threat Group was previously spotted**\nattacking research facilities in multiple regions such as the US, Europe and the Middle\nEast. The group is known to be behind multiple cyber espionage and offensive cyber\nattacks, operating in the interest of the Iranian regime, leveraging cyberwarfare in\naccordance with Iran’s geopolitical interests.\n**Use of Publicly Available Exploits: The Phosphorus Group was first seen exploiting**\n[the ProxyShell vulnerability, and later on the Log4j vulnerability as well, utilizing fresh](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-releases-vaccine-to-prevent-exploitation-of-apache-log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228)\nexploits in the wild.\n\n## A Glimpse into Phosphorus Updated Arsenal\n\nFollowing up on both public and non-public intelligence that is available to Cybereason in\nregard to the Phosphorus threat actor, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team was able to identify\na new toolset that includes a novel backdoor, malware loaders, a browser info stealer, and a\nkeylogger.\n\nIt is worth noting that some of the more recent methods that were observed in attacks\nattributed to the Phosphorus group included open-source tools such as the famous\n[DiskCryptor library and also BitLocker, along with the](https://github.com/DavidXanatos/DiskCryptor) [Fast Reverse Proxy which is used for](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)\nRDP proxying.\n\nThe following sections will detail the discovery process and analysis of the newly identified\ntools.\n\n### Pivoting from a Previously Known Arsenal\n\nThe journey to the discovery of the new toolset started with threat intelligence efforts that\nincluded pivoting on an IP address (162.55.136[.]20) that was already attributed to Iranian\n[threat actors by multiple sources, including US CERT.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a)\n\nWhile examining different files that were downloaded from this IP address, we stumbled\n[upon a file named “WindowsProcesses.exe”:](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a4c908859d78973a94581ea010b10b9a83d25cbafe0c0704dc67ff43c05f0040)\n\n\n-----\n\n_WindowsProcesses.exe hosted on the abovementioned IP_\n\nThe file seems to have only been detected by 35/68 antivirus vendors, according to\nVirusTotal:\n\n_WindowsProcesses.exe details as seen in VirusTotal_\n\n**Analysis of WindowsProcesses.exe**\n\nThis file, entitled “WindowsProcesses.exe” is a 64-bit executable loader whose sole purpose\nis to resolve relevant DLLs and load another file from the “%windir%\\Temp” path entitled\n“dll.dll”:\n\n\n-----\n\n_WindowsProcesses and related modules execution diagram_\n\nOnce the relevant DLLs (mostly related to .NET runtime libraries) and API calls are resolved,\ndll.dll is executed:\n\n_The main code of WindowsProcesses.exe_\n\nBy the looks of it, the authors could have been inspired by a code snippet found publicly\n[available on GitHub, which facilitates running PowerShell with CLR in native runtime. The](https://gist.github.com/farzinenddo/bb1f1ecb56aa9326abc7b47fc99e588e)\nsnippet is named “Powerless”, and the authors seem to have kept that naming convention,\n\n\n-----\n\nas shown in the PDB path of the binary:\n\n_C:\\\\Users\\\\pugna\\\\Desktop\\\\126\\\\V1\\\\PowerLessCLR\\\\x64\\\\Release\\\\PowerLessCLR.pdb_\n\nAnalysis of dll.dll\n\nDll.dll is a simple .NET AES decryptor that uses a hardcoded key “()*&3dCfabE2/123” to\ndecode another file named “upc” to ultimately execute PowerShell code from the decrypted\nobject:\n\n_The code of dll.dll_\n\nupc\n\nThe upc encrypted BLOB is decrypted using dll.dll, and contains multiple encryption layers\nthat all are decrypted in stages using base64 and AES ECB decryption.\n\nThe keys that are being used for decryption are as follows:\n\n()*&3dCfabE2/123\n0123654789mkiujn\n25sL(*14@#SDFcgd\n\nPrior to decrypting the PowerShell backdoor, an intermediate stage takes place when the\nvictim’s machine is assigned a unique identifier which is sent to the C2, which downloads an\nadditional configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The intermediate stage during the PowerLess backdoor decryption_\n\nAnalysis of the PowerLess Backdoor\n\nAfter all the AES encrypted layers are decrypted, the PowerLess backdoor is executed:\n\n_PowerLess backdoor command parsing code segment_\n\nThe PowerLess backdoor is equipped with the following capabilities:\n\nDownloading and executing additional malware and files\n\nAdditional modules:\n\n[Browsers info stealer](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ac9ed12685f0094de0897ff72b6c457ff4fb8f8750cf1fedccd59c8976eb4f24)\n[Keylogger module](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3f9fb115afd2da19d3a231791dbe3c6f615c9908b7d12376ef8b097ebdfec6e9)\nEncrypted channel with the C2\nExecuting arbitrary commands\n\n\n-----\n\nKilling processes\nStealing browser data\nKeylogging\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the backdoor is being run within a .NET context, so therefore it\ndoes not spawn “powershell.exe”. This behavior can be interpreted as an attempt to evade\ncertain PowerShell detections, although PowerShell logs are being saved on the machine:\n\n_Windows Processes and the malicious loaded module “dll.dll” as seen in the Cybereason_\n_XDR Platform_\n\nOddly enough, there is a part of the code in the PowerLess Backdoor, that do spawn a\npowershell.exe process, when the request to kill a process is received from the C2:\n\n_A part of the PowerLess Backdoor that spawns powershell.exe_\n\nIt can be assumed that the native language of the backdoor’s authors is likely not English\ngiven the abundance of typos and grammatical mistakes found in the code:\n\n\n-----\n\n_PowerLess backdoor logging_\n\n_Keylogger_\n\nOne of the modules downloaded by the PowerLess backdoor is a keylogger that is written in\n.NET. It’s core functionality is quite simple, consisting of hooks and the logging of the user’s\nkeystrokes:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Partial code from the keylogger module_\n\nThe logs are being stored in the following path: \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\Report.06E17A5A7325-4325-8E5D-E172EBA7FC5BK\":\n\n_Logs path of the keylogger module_\n\n_Stealer_\n\nAnother module is a browser info stealer, which is also written in .NET, and includes the\n[BouncyCastle crypto library. It also uses an SQLite data reader object for Chrome and Edge](https://www.bouncycastle.org/)\nbrowser database files. In the staging phase, the data is encrypted and written in JSON\nformat for exfiltration:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Partial code from the info stealer module_\n\nThe logs are being stored in the following path: “C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\cup.tmp”:\n\n_Logs path of the stealer module_\n\n**Additional Tools Potentially Related to Phosphorus**\n\nIn addition to the newly discovered PowerLess Backdoor, other tools were identified by the\nNocturnus Team which are suspected to originate from the same developer. However, at this\npoint in time there isn't enough evidence to conclusively tie these tools to Phosphorus with a\nhigh level of confidence.\n\nLooking at the PE info of “WindowsProcesses.exe”, the below PDB path is present:\n“C:\\Users\\pugna\\Desktop\\126\\V1\\PowerLessCLR\\x64\\Release\\PowerLessCLR.pdb”:\n\n_The PDB path from WindowsProcesses.exe_\n\nSearching for the prefix “C:\\Users\\pugna” returns other unidentified tools:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Artifacts found in VirusTotal with the search “C:\\Users\\pugna”_\n\n_Chromium F_\n\n“Chromium F.exe” is yet another .NET browser info stealer. Although the code is different, by\nthe functionality it is similar to the abovementioned info stealer module, leading us to assess\nthat it might be an earlier variant:\n\n_Code segment from Chromium F.exe_\n\n_Sou.exe - Audio Recorder_\n\n[“Sou.exe” is another .NET file, but this time it’s an audio recorder which uses the NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)\nopen source library:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Code segment from Sou.exe_\n\n_A New Locker in the Making?_\n\nOne of the more recent tools that was allegedly from the same developer is what appears to\n[be an unfinished Ransomware variant. It is also written in .NET and at this point doesn’t do](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/014e73d083df4a5816bd838d03a1b38e1438914154fe0bb7d988d05df0407b84)\nanything except locking the target’s screen. As can be seen, the fields like the ransom\namount and attacker’s email are yet to be set. Although unfinished, it is worth mentioning\nthat the sample was uploaded from Iran via web, and it might imply yet another step in the\ndirection of this threat actor towards ransomware:\n\n_Unfinished ransomware sample uploaded to VirusTotal from Iran_\n\n\n-----\n\n_The unfinished ransomware locker screen_\n\nAnalysis of FRP Loaders\n\n_Java Multi Platform Loader_\n\nOne of the more active IPs that was [reported in the ProxyShell attacks was](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/11/15/exchange-exploit-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/)\n[148.251.71[.]182. In addition, another recent report mentions this IP address as part of an](https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/apt35-exploits-log4j-vulnerability-to-distribute-new-modular-powershell-toolkit/)\n[active exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability:](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/what-is-log4shell/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Files found on the IP address 148.251.71[.]182_\n\nThe “symantec” and “update” themed files all serve the FRP again. The “RCE” links, on the\nother hand, serve a Java loader that distinguishes the victim machine’s operating system\nand drops the appropriate version of FRP:\n\n_The Java RCE class_\n\nThere are two slightly different variations of the loader, but eventually they check for the file\nseparator of the OS, which is “/” in case it’s Linux or “\\” in Windows, and then downloads the\npayload and creates persistence:\n\n_Content of the malicious Java class_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Powershell to Exe Downloader_\n\nAnother loader which eventually delivers FRP is PowerShell code converted to an\n[executable by the “Ps1 To Exe” freeware that is available for download on public forums,](https://m.majorgeeks.com/files/details/ps1_to_exe.html)\nwhere less technical people can successfully use it:\n\n_Information about one of the FRP loaders_\n\nFinally, the loader creates a scheduled task for FRP, of course while being dependent on the\nOS type.\n\nA full process tree of a real time attack that exploits the ProxyShell vulnerability and\ndeployment of the FRP modules, can be seen below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_A real time FRP staging and execution as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform_\n\nOnce the attackers exploited the vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server, they downloaded\nthe FRP module, ran multiple reconnaissance commands, created persistence, dumped\n[credentials using a known LOLBIN technique (Comsvcs.dll), and attempted to move laterally,](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Libraries/comsvcs/)\nas can be seen in the above Cybereason XDR Platform image.\n\n## The Memento Ransomware Connection\n\nAnother IP that appears in US CERT’s list is 91.214.124[.]143. Searching it in VirusTotal\nreveals other malicious files communicating with it, as well as unique URL directory patterns\nthat reveal a potential connection to Memento Ransomware:\n\nThe string “gsdhdDdfgA5sS” appears to be generated by the same script as the one\nlisted in the [Memento Ransomware IOCs: “gadfTs55sghsSSS”.](https://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/ransomware_memento.csv)\nThe domain “google.onedriver-srv[.]ml” was previously resolved to the IP address\n[91.214.124[.]143 mentioned in the US CERT alert about Iran state sponsored actors](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a)\nactivity:\n\n_Some of the Memento IOCs that are suspected to be related to Phosphorus_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Connector3.exe naming convention: as mentioned above, Phosphorus has been\nobserved using the FRP tool in many occasions. The file name that is used for FRP\nand reported by the US CERT is “Connector3.exe”. As can be seen below, the same\nname is being used to name a backdoor by Memento:\n\n_FRP named “Connector3.exe” from US CERT report_\n\nThe activity of Phosphorus with regard to ProxyShell took place in about the same time\nframe as Memento. Iranian threat actors were also reported to be turning to\nransomware during that period, which strengthens the hypothesis that Memento is\noperated by an Iranian threat actor.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this report, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team detailed a previously undocumented\nPowerShell backdoor dubbed PowerLess, used by the Iranian APT Phosphorus in recent\nattacks. This research also provided further details regarding the group’s tools and\ntechniques, including the use of publicly available tools and a combination of coding\nlanguages.\n\nThe extensive usage of open source tools that is assessed to demonstrate the intermediate\ncoding skills of the attackers. The use of various programming languages also might point to\na lack of specialization in any specific coding language. This research also highlights how\nimportant it is for threat intelligence analysts to “follow the breadcrumbs,” such as pivoting on\nknown infrastructure or the PDB paths left by the attackers in this case, in order to pave the\nway for discovering additional tools and connections to other operations.\n\nFinally, a connection between Phosphorus and the Memento ransomware was also found\nthrough mutual TTP patterns and attack infrastructure, strengthening the connection\nbetween this previously unattributed ransomware and the Phosphorus group.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [Cybereason XDR Platform detects and blocks the PowerLess Trojan and other](https://www.cybereason.com/platform/xdr)\nadvanced TTPs used in this operation.
