Persisting as a Print Processor, it\nwas used by the Winnti Group against several video gaming companies that are based in South Korea and Taiwan and\ndevelop MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) games. Video games developed by these companies are available on\npopular gaming platforms and have thousands of simultaneous players.\n\nIn at least one case, the malware operators compromised a victim’s build system, which could have led to a supply-chain\nattack, allowing the attackers to trojanize game executables. In another case, the game servers were compromised,\nwhich could have allowed the attackers to, for example, manipulate in-game currencies for financial gain.\n\nThe Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for high-profile supply-chain attacks against the software\n[industry, leading to the distribution of trojanized software (such as CCleaner, ASUS LiveUpdate and multiple video](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/09/21/cconsiderations-on-ccleaner-incident/)\ngames) that is then used to compromise more victims. Recently, ESET researchers also discovered a campaign of the\nWinnti Group targeting several Hong Kong universities with ShadowPad and Winnti malware.\n\n_About the “Winnti Group” naming:_\n\n_We have chosen to keep the name “Winnti Group” since it’s the name first used to identify it, in 2013, by Kaspersky._\n_Since Winnti is also a malware family, we always write “Winnti Group” when we refer to the malefactors behind the_\n_attacks. Since 2013, it has been demonstrated that Winnti is only one of the many malware families used by the Winnti_\n_Group._\n\n## Attribution to the Winnti Group\n\nMultiple indicators led us to attribute this campaign to the Winnti Group. Some of the C&C domains used by PipeMon\n[were used by Winnti malware in previous campaigns mentioned in our white paper on the Winnti Group arsenal. Besides,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/14/connecting-dots-exposing-arsenal-methods-winnti/)\nWinnti malware was also found in 2019 at some of the companies that were later compromised with PipeMon.\n\nIn addition to Winnti malware, a custom AceHash (a credential harvester) binary found at other victims of the Winnti\nGroup, and signed with a well-known stolen certificate used by the group (Wemade IO), was also used during this\ncampaign.\n\nThe certificate used to sign the PipeMon installer, modules and additional tools is linked to a video game company that\n[was compromised in a supply-chain attack in late 2018 by the Winnti Group and was likely stolen at that time.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/11/gaming-industry-scope-attackers-asia/)\n\nInterestingly, PipeMon modules are installed in %SYSTEM32%\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\; this path was also used in the past to\n[drop the second stage of the trojanized CCleaner.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/in-depth-analysis-of-the-ccleaner-backdoor-stage-2-dropper-and-its-payload/)\n\nAdditionally, compromising a software developer’s build environment to subsequently compromise legitimate application\nis a known modus operandi of the Winnti Group.\n\n## Targeted companies\n\nCompanies targeted in this campaign are video game developers, producing MMO games and based in South Korea and\nTaiwan. In at least one case, the attackers were able to compromise the company’s build orchestration server, allowing\nthem to take control of the automated build systems. This could have allowed the attackers to include arbitrary code of\ntheir choice in the video game executables.\n\nESET contacted the affected companies and provided the necessary information to remediate the compromise.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nTwo different variants of PipeMon were found at the targeted companies. Only for the more recent variant were we able\nto identify the first stage which is responsible for installing and persisting PipeMon.\n\n\n-----\n\n### First stage\n\nPipeMon’s first stage consists of a password-protected RARSFX executable embedded in the .rsrc section of its\nlauncher. The launcher writes the RARSFX to setup0.exe in a directory named with a randomly generated, eightcharacter, ASCII string located in the directory returned by GetTempPath. Once written to disk, the RARSFX is executed\nwith CreateProcess by providing the decryption password in an argument, as follows:\n\nsetup0.exe -p*|T/PMR{|T2^LWJ*\n\nNote that the password is different with each sample.\n\nThe content of the RARSFX is then extracted into %TMP%\\RarSFX0 and consists of the following files:\n\nCrLnc.dat – Encrypted payload\nDuser.dll – Used for UAC bypass\nosksupport.dll – Used for UAC bypass\nPrintDialog.dll – Used for the malicious print processor initialization\nPrintDialog.exe – Legitimate Windows executable used to load PrintDialog.dll\nsetup.dll – Installation DLL\nsetup.exe – Main executable\n\nNote that in the event of a folder name collision, the number at the end of the RarSFX0 string is incremented until a\ncollision is avoided. Further, not all these files are necessarily present in the archive, depending on the installer.\n\nOnce extracted, setup.exe is executed without arguments. Its sole purpose is to load setup.dll using LoadLibraryA. Once\nloaded, setup.dll checks whether an argument in the format –x:n (where n is an integer) was provided; the mode of\noperation will be different depending on the presence of n. Supported arguments and their corresponding behavior are\nshown in Table 1. setup.exe is executed without arguments by the RARSFX, and checks whether it’s running with\n[elevated privileges. If not, it will attempt to obtain such privileges using token impersonation if the version of Windows is](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/)\n[below Windows 7 build 7601; otherwise it will attempt different UAC bypass techniques, allowing installation of the](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)\npayload loader into one of:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\DEment.dll\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\EntAppsvc.dll\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\Interactive.dll\n\ndepending on the variant. Note that we weren’t able to retrieve samples related to Interactive.dll.\n\n_Table 1. setup.exe supported arguments and their corresponding behavior._\n\n##### Command line argu‐ ment value Behavior\n\n -x:0 Load the payload loader.\n\n -x:1 Attempt to enable SeLoadDriverPrivilege for the current process. If successful, attempt to install the payload loader; otherwise, restart setup.exe with the –x:2 argument using parent process spoofing.\n\n -x:2 Attempt to enable SeLoadDriverPrivilege for the current process. If successful, attempt to install the payload loader.\n\nThis loader is stored encrypted within setup.dll, which will decrypt it before writing it to the aforementioned location.\n\n### Persistence using Windows Print Processors\n\nThe location where the malicious DLL is dropped was not chosen randomly. This is the path where Windows Print\nProcessors are located and setup.dll registers the malicious DLL loader as an alternative Print Processor by setting one\nof the following registry values:\n\n\n-----\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\Windows x64\\Print Processors\\PrintFiiterPipelineSvc\\Driver =\n“DEment.dll”\n\nor\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\Windows x64\\Print Processors\\lltdsvc1\\Driver =\n“EntAppsvc.dll”\n\ndepending on the variant. Note the typo in PrintFiiterPipelineSvc (which has no impact on the Print Processor installation\nsince any name can be used).\n\nAfter having registered the Print Processor, PipeMon restarts the print spooler service (spoolsv.exe). As a result, the\nmalicious print process is loaded when the spooler service starts. Note that the Print Spooler service starts at each PC\nstartup, which ensures persistence across system resets.\n\n[This technique is really similar to the Print Monitor persistence technique (being used by DePriMon, for example) and, to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1013/)\nour knowledge, has not been documented previously.\n\nAdditionally, the encrypted payload, CrLnc.dat, extracted from the RARSFX is written to the registry at the following\nlocation, depending on the installer:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Print\\Components\\DC20FD7E-4B1B-4B88-8172-61F0BED7D9E8\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Print\\Components\\A66F35-4164-45FF-9CB4-69ACAA10E52D\n\nThis encrypted registry payload is then loaded, decrypted and executed by the previously registered Print Processor\nlibrary. The whole PipeMon staging and persistence is shown in Figure 1.\n\n_Figure 1. PipeMon staging and persistence_\n\n## PipeMon\n\nWe named this new implant PipeMon because it uses multiple named pipes for inter-module communication and\naccording to its PDB path, the name of the Visual Studio project used by its developer is “Monitor”.\n\nAs mentioned previously, two different PipeMon variants were found. Considering the first variant, we couldn’t retrieve the\ninstaller; thus, we don’t know for sure the persistence technique that was used. But considering that this first variant of\nPipeMon was also located in the Print Processor directory, it’s likely that the same persistence mechanism was used.\n\n### Original variant\n\nPipeMon is a modular backdoor where each module is a single DLL exporting a function called IntelLoader and is loaded\n[using a reflective loading technique. Each module exhibits different functionalities that are shown in Table 2.](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/blob/master/dll/src/ReflectiveLoader.c)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe loader, responsible for loading the main modules (ManagerMain and GuardClient) is Win32CmdDll.dll and is located\nin the Print Processors directory. The modules are stored encrypted on disk at the same location with inoffensive-looking\nnames such as:\n\nbanner.bmp\ncertificate.cert\nLicense.hwp\nJSONDIU7c9djE\nD8JNCKS0DJE\nB0SDFUWEkNCj.logN\n\nNote that .hwp is the extension used by Hangul Word Processor from Hangul Office, which is very popular in South\nKorea.\n\nThe modules are RC4 encrypted and the decryption key Com!123Qasdz is hardcoded into each module. Win32CmDll.dll\ndecrypts and injects the ManagerMain and GuardClient modules. The ManagerMain module is responsible for decrypting\nand injecting the Communication module, while the GuardClient module will ensure that the Communication module is\nrunning and reload it if necessary. An overview of how PipeMon operates is shown in Figure 2.\n\nWin32CmDll.dll first tries to inject the ManagerMain and GuardClient modules into a process with one of the following\nnames: lsass.exe, wininit.exe or lsm.exe. If that fails, it tries to inject into one of the registered windows services\nprocesses, excluding processes named spoolsv.exe, ekrn.exe (ESET), avp.exe (Kaspersky) or dllhost.exe. As a last\noption, if everything else failed, it tries to use the processes taskhost.exe, taskhostw.exe or explorer.exe.\n\nThe process candidates for Communication module injection must be in the TCP connection table with either 0.0.0.0 as\nthe local address, or an ESTABLISHED connection and owning a LOCAL SERVICE token. These conditions are likely\nused to hide the Communication module into a process that is already communicating over the network so that the traffic\nfrom the Communication module would seem inconspicuous and possibly also whitelisted in the firewall. If no process\nmeets the previous requirements, the ManagerMain module tries to inject the Communication module into explorer.exe.\nProcesses belonging to the Windows Store Apps and processes named egui.exe (ESET) and avpui.exe (Kaspersky) are\nignored from the selection.\n\n_Table 2.

The names of these modules are an educated guess based on the named pipes used to\ncommunicate with them:\n\nScreen\nRoute\nCMD\nInCmd\nFile\n\n#### Inter-module communication\n\nInter-module communication is performed via named pipes, using two named pipes per communication channel between\neach individual module, one for sending and one for receiving. Table 3 lists the communication channels and their\ncorresponding named pipes.\n\n_Table 3.

It is sent to the Communication module through a named pipe.\n\nA separate communication channel is created for each installed module. The communication protocol used is TLS over\n[TCP. The communication is handled with the HP-Socket library. All the messages are RC4 encrypted using the](https://github.com/ldcsaa/HP-Socket)\nhardcoded key. If the size of the message to be transferred is greater than or equal to 4KB, it is first compressed using\nzlib’s Deflate implementation.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 1\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n 4\n\n 5\n\n 6\n\n 7\n\n 8\n\n 9\n\n 10\n\n 11\n\n 12\n\n 13\n\n 1\n\n 2\n\n 3\n\n 4\n\n 5\n\n 6\n\n 7\n\n 8\n\n 9\n\n 10\n\n 11\n\n\n##### struct CCMSG\n\n {\n\n   BYTE is_compressed;\n\n   CMD cmd;\n\n };\n\n struct CMD\n\n {\n\n   QWORD cmd_type;\n\n   DWORD cmd_size;\n\n   DWORD cmd_arg;\n\n   BYTE data[cmd_size - 16];\n\n };\n\n struct beacon_msg\n\n {\n\n   BYTE isCompressed = 0;\n\n   CMD cmd_hdr;\n\n   WCHAR win_version[128];\n\n   WCHAR adapters_addrs[128];\n\n   WCHAR adapters_addrs[64];\n\n   WCHAR local_addr[64];\n\n   WCHAR malware_version[64];\n\n   WCHAR computer_name[64];\n\n }\n\n\n_Figure 3. C&C message and beacon formats_\n\nTo initiate communication with the C&C server, a beacon message is first sent that contains the following information:\n\nOS version\nphysical addresses of connected network adapters concatenated with %B64_TIMESTAMP%\nvictim’s local IP address\nbackdoor version/campaign ID; we’ve observed the following values\n\n“1.1.1.4beat”\n“1.1.1.4Bata”\n“1.1.1.5”\nVictim computer name\n\n\n-----\n\nThe information about the victim’s machine is collected by the ManagerMain module and sent to the Communication\nmodule via the named pipe. The backdoor version is hardcoded in the Communication module in cleartext.\n\nThe format of the beacon message is shown in Figure 3 and the supported commands are shown in Table 5.\n\n_Table 5.

While exhibiting an architecture highly similar to the original variant, its code was likely rewritten\nfrom scratch.\n\nThe RC4 code used to decrypt the modules and strings was replaced by a simple XOR with 0x75E8EEAF as the key and\nall the hardcoded strings were removed. The named pipes used for inter-module communication are now named using\nrandom values instead of explicit names and conform to the format \\\\.\\pipe\\%rand%, where %rand% is a\npseudorandomly generated string of 31 characters containing only mixed case alphabetic characters.\n\nHere, only the main loader (i.e. the malicious DLL installed as a Print Processor) is stored as a file on disk; the modules\nare stored in the registry by the installer (from the CrLnc.dat file) and are described in Table 6.\n\n_Table 6.
