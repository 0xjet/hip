If opened on an unpatched version of Windows, these documents**\nautomatically install chosen malware on the victim’s computer, with no user clicks\nrequired.\n**Buy a commercially-available keylogger and configure the booby-trapped files to**\n**download and install it. (This case used the now-defunct Hawkeye keylogger.)**\n\n**Pick a broad industry sector, e.g. leather and leather products.**\n**Send a small number of scam emails (typically a few thousand in total) pretending to**\nbe quotation requests or payment information, each containing a booby-trapped MWI\ndocument.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Infect victims with the keylogger and wait until they type in their email passwords.**\n**Use the stolen email passwords to watch their inboxes, until you see that a**\ncustomer has been invoiced and is about to pay.\n\n**Email the customer from the hijacked account, instructing the customer to use a**\nnew account number for future payments.\n**Take the money yourself and quickly move it where it can’t easily be found or**\nrecovered.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike ransomware campaigns where the crooks aim to make millions of dollars out of\nhundreds of thousands of victims, $100-$400 at a time, this sort of attack works as a sort of\nreversed pyramid, where very low attack volumes are needed at each level of the pyramid.\n\nAs Szapi describes:\n\nIn the first campaign, the crooks sent out about five waves of spam with the malicious\nWord document. Each wave had about 500 targets. The infection statistics show that\nas a result of this spam they ended up with 80-150 infected computers.\n\nFrom these infected victims, the crooks went on to identify at least six victims whom\nthey followed up with payment hijacking messages. They chose cutomers with highvalue unpaid invoices, ranging from $200,000 to $900,000.\n\nWe don’t know the success rate of the attempted payment hijacks. But even if only one\nhijack succeeded (a reasonable assumption because they continued in this vein with\neight campaigns over several months), that’s a huge return.\n\nWorst of all, this is effectively a high-tech crime available to low-tech criminals.\n\nThey bought in the necessary booby-trapped documents; bought in the keylogger; paid\nsomeone to send very small quantities of spam; and then they settled down to carry out oldfashioned, targeted deception and fraud.\n\nJust one or two criminals, working unaided, and with enough patience to go after a small\nnumber of high-value victims, could easily operate a scam of this sort.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd although it s easy to say, As a debtor about to pay a huge invoice, I d never fall for this\nsort of scam,” remember that the email giving the updated remittance advice – the payment\nhijack itself – may very well come from the same person who sent you the company’s\naccount number when you first signed up as a customer.\n\nThat’s one reason the crooks use the reversed pyramid approach described above.\n\nThey don’t need to send payment hijack emails from every hacked email account, only from\nthe email accounts that are likely to be believed by the recipients.\n\n## What to do?\n\n**Patch promptly. The booby-trapped documents in this attack relied on a security hole**\nthat had been patched years before.\n**Keep your security software up-to-date. A good anti-virus can block attacks like this**\nat several points, and you win if you can stop any one of them, starting with the original\ninbound email.\n**Beware of unsolicited attachments. This can be hard if your job is business**\ndevelopment and the email is a Request For Quotation, but avoid opening just any old\ndocument.\n**Consider using a stripped-down document viewer. Microsoft’s own Word Viewer,**\nfor example, is usually much less vulnerable than Word itelf because it’s much simpler.\n[(It doesn’t support macros, either, which protects against Locky-type attacks, too.)](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/02/17/locky-ransomware-what-you-need-to-know/)\n**If your email software supports it, use 2FA. That’s short for** two-factor\nauthentication, those one-time codes that come up on your phone on a special security\ntoken. With 2FA, just stealing your email password isn’t enough on its own.\n**Have a two-person process for important transactions. Paying large invoices and**\nchanging remittance advice shouldn’t be too easy. Require separate approval from a\nsupervisor, so you always get a second opinion when large sums are at stake.\n\n**LEARN MORE ABOUT 2FA**\n\n[(Audio player above not working?
