If APT27\nfocuses on cyberespionage, Winnti is known for its financial motivation.\n\nIn a [joint report shared with BleepingComputer, Profero and Security Joes share evidence](https://medium.com/proferosec-osm/apt27-turns-to-ransomware-77aaba41ef1e)\npointing to these two groups saying that they found a sample of the Clambling backdoor\nsimilar to the one used in the DRBControl campaign.\n\nThey also uncovered the ASPXSpy webshell. A modified version of this malware has been\nseen previously in attacks attributed to APT27.\n\nOther malware found on infected computers includes the PlugX remote access trojan,\nregularly mentioned in cybersecurity reports about campaigns linked to China.\n\n\"With regards to who is behind this specific infection chain, there are extremely strong links\nto APT27/Emissary Panda, in terms of code similarities, and TTPs [tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures],\" the report reads.\n\nAlthough a cyberespionage group engaging in a financially-motivated campaign is unusual,\nthis attack would not be the first time APT27 deploys ransomware on victim systems.\n\nResearchers at Positive Technologies attributed a Polar ransomware attack from April 2020\nto APT27, based on the use of malware normally used by this group.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacks against the five companies in the gambling sector were not particularly\nsophisticated and relied on known methods to evade detection and move laterally.\n\nThe report from [Profero and](https://profero.io/) [Security Joes says that the actor deployed PlugX and](https://www.securityjoes.com/)\nClambling malware in the system memory using an older Google Updater executable that\nwas vulnerable to DLL side-loading.\n\n\"For each of the two samples, there was a legitimate executable, a malicious DLL, and a\nbinary file consisting of shellcode responsible for extracting the payload from itself and\nrunning it in memory. Both samples used the signed Google Updater, and both DLLs were\nlabeled goopdate.dll, however the PlugX binary file was named license.rtf, and the\nClambling binary file was named English.rtf.\"\n\n[Additionally, the attacker leveraged a vulnerability from 2017 (CVE-2017-0213) to escalate](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2017-0213)\nprivileges on the machine. Exploit code for this bug is publicly available.\n\nDaniel Bunce, Principal Security Analyst at Security Joes, told BleepingComputer that the\nkey takeaway from these attacks is the involvement of a cyberespionage group in a\nfinancially-driven campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nOmri Segev Moyal, CEO at Profero, says that the audacity of such a malicious group is\nanother signal that governments should have a unified approach in the fight against these\nthreats.\n\nRecently, another hacker group believed to work for a government has been linked to\nransomware attacks. According to ClearSky, the Iranian-backed hacking group Fox Kitten\n[has been involved in Pay2Key ransomware operations against organizations in Israel and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-nation-state-hackers-linked-to-pay2key-ransomware/)\nBrazil.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Chinese ‘Space Pirates’ are hacking Russian aerospace firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-space-pirates-are-hacking-russian-aerospace-firms/)\n\n[Hackers stole data undetected from US, European orgs since 2019](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-stole-data-undetected-from-us-european-orgs-since-2019/)\n\n[Google: Chinese state hackers keep targeting Russian govt agencies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chinese-state-hackers-keep-targeting-russian-govt-agencies/)\n\n[Chinese hacking group uses new 'Fire Chili' Windows rootkit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hacking-group-uses-new-fire-chili-windows-rootkit/)\n\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[China](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/china/)\n[Winnti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/winnti/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
