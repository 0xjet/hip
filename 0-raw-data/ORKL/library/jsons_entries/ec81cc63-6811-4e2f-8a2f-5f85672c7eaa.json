XXX\n2. XXX\n3. XXX\n4. XXX\n5. XXX\nMac + external drives\n1. XXX?\n2. XXX?\n3. XXX\n4. XXX\n5. XXX\n6. XXX\nYou have to pay for decryption in Bitcoins.\nThe price depends on how fast you write us.\nAfter payment we will send you the tool(for mac and linux) that will decrypt all\nyour files. \nFree decryption as guarantee\nBefore paying you can send us up to 5 files for free decryption.\nThe total size of files must be less than 4Mb (non archived), and files should not\ncontain valuable information. (databases, backups, large excel sheets, etc.), file\nname shouldn't be changed.\nHow to obtain Bitcoins\nThe easiest way to buy bitcoins is LocalBitcoins site. You have to register, click\n'Buy bitcoins', and select the seller by payment method and price.\nhttps://localbitcoins.com/buy_bitcoins\nAlso you can find other places to buy Bitcoins and beginners guide here:\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/information/how-can-i-buy-bitcoins/\nAttention!\nDo not rename encrypted files.\nDo not try to decrypt your data using third party software, it may cause permanent\ndata loss.\nNote: we can answer up to 6-9 hours, because of another timezone.\"\n\n```\nAccording to the victim, the threat actors are asking for 7 bitcoins, or approximately\n$64,500, to decrypt the files.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear possible to recover files encrypted by Age for free at this\ntime.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Ransom payment is roughly 15% of the total cost of ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransom-payment-is-roughly-15-percent-of-the-total-cost-of-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Google shut down caching servers at two Russian ISPs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/google-shut-down-caching-servers-at-two-russian-isps/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[AgeLocker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/agelocker/)\n[Google](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/google/)\n[Ransom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransom/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
