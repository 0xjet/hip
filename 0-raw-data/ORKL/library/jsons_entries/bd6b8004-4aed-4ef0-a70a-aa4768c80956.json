    "plain_text": "# The NCCC at the NSDC of Ukraine warns of a new mechanism of attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure\n\n**rnbo.gov.ua/en/Diialnist/4820.html**\n\nВаш браузер є застарілим і не підтримує сучасні веб-стандарти, а так само становить\nпотенційну загрозу вашої безпеки.\n\nБудь ласка, встановіть сучасний браузер\n\nStarting from February 18, this year, the National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity at\nthe NSDC of Ukraine records massive DDoS attacks on the Ukrainian segment of the\nInternet, mainly on the websites of the security and defense sector.\n\nIn particular, attacks were carried out on the websites of the Security Service of Ukraine, the\nNational Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, resources of other state institutions and\nstrategic enterprises. It was revealed that addresses belonging to certain Russian traffic\nnetworks were the source of these coordinated attacks.\n\nDuring the response and analysis, it was found that the attackers used a new mechanism of\ncyberattacks, which had not been observed before in similar incidents.\n\nIn such a way, during an\n\nattack, vulnerable government web servers are infected with a virus that covertly makes\nthem part of a botnet used for DDoS attacks on other resources. At the same time, security\nsystems of Internet providers identify compromised web servers as a source of attacks and\nbegin to block their work by automatically blacklisting them. Thus, even after the end of the\nDDoS phase, the attacked websites remain inaccessible to users.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NCCC experts are ready to provide consultations and technical assistance to detect and\nrespond to this type of cyberattack. In case of detecting the compromised websites, DDoSattacks, please notify the National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity\n(report@ncscc.gov.ua) immediately.\n\n[Print Version](https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/Diialnist/4820.html?PRINT)\n\n## Organization of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine\n\n\n-----",
