Able to\nachieve persistance and communicate with a botnet server, it works over a reverse TCP\nconnection, avoiding firewall issues.\n\nCreating commands is fairly easy, feel free to contribute !\n\n## Features\n\nMost notable remote commands :\n\nKeylogger\nWebcam control\nFile upload and download\nRemote program execution\nSystem informations\nLocal Area Network scan\nWifi profiles informations dump (including passwords)\nFirefox and Google Chrome databases information extraction\nRemote shell\nPersistance\n\n\n[codefactorcodefactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/valsov/backnet) AA\n\n\n-----\n\nLoadCommands - allows you to load commands from DLLs at runtime\n\n**More to come !**\n\n## Structure\n\nBackNet consists in 3 projects :\n\n**Master : The console application used to interact with the slave by sending commands.**\nIt can also be used to issue commands to the botnet server.\n**Slave : The WPF application to deploy on the computer you wish to monitor and**\ncontrol.\n**Shared : DLL that contains global mechanics for the Master and Slave projects. For**\nexample, the network manager. A DLL is not welcome in a lot of scenarios when using\n[the Slave, so a reference embedding tool is used for the slave project : Costura Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Costura)\n\nCommunication between the Master and Slave was made easy, you can send and read\nlines, as well as send and receive files in just one line.\n\nSend a line of text\n```\nGlobalCommandsManager.networkManager.WriteLine(\"Hello !\");\n\n```\nRead a line of text\n```\nstring message = GlobalCommandsManager.networkManager.ReadLine();\n\n```\nSend a file over the network, using a FileStream\n```\nGlobalCommandsManager.networkManager.StreamToNetworkStream(fileStream);\n\n```\nReceive a file over the network\n```\nGlobalCommandsManager.networkManager.NetworkStreamToStream(fileStream);\n\n```\nFile transferts come with a nice progress bar !\n\n## Commands\n\nCommands are located in both the Master and Slave projects. In order to create a new\ncommand, you will have to create two files containing the new command class, in the Master\nproject and Slave project. A command class should be internal. A command will first be sent\nto the Slave, then processed by the Master (to process the Slave messages)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Master commands must implement the IMasterCommand interface\n\n**name : how to call your command from the Master interface**\n**description : describe what it will do**\n**isLocal : should this command only be executed on the master side ? (example :**\nlcd - local change directory)\n**validArguments : list of string representing the command arguments syntax, will**\nbe described below\n**Process(List<string> args) : the actual code executed on the Master side**\n**PreProcess(List<string> args) -optional- : if your command needs to do some**\nchecks on the Master side before sending the command to the Slave, just make\nyour IMasterCommand class implement the IPreprocessCommand interface as\nwell\nThe Slave commands must implement the ICommand interface\n\n**name : same as the one in the IMasterCommand**\n**Process(List<string> args) : code executed on the Slave side, this is usually**\nwhere most of your work goes !\n\nValid arguments are stated in a string which must follow those rule:\n\nIf there is no arguments for the command, then null\n\"?\" is for a string, and \"0\" is for an integer\nIf a string is confidential, add a \"*\" => \"?*\", this way, it will not be sent to the slave as is\n? arguments must be followed by a [ArgumentName] => example: \"?:[filename]\" or \"?*:\n\n[filename]\"\n\nExample : download command\n```\npublic List<string> validArguments { get; set; } = new List<string>()\n{\n  \"?:[remoteFileName] ?*:[localFileName]\"\n};\n\n```\nThe arguments are composed of two strings, the remote file name and the local file name.\nThe latter won't be sent to the slave because it is confidential, so it's marked with a star.\n\n## Botnet\n\nBacknet was designed to communicate with a botnet server to issue commands to all the\nregistered Slaves. This way, you can make a registered Slave connect to you (Master) and\nsend commands directly to it. More botnet commands will be added, like DDOS, bitcoin\nmining, etc... Of course, this behaviour is optional and requires you to setup a botnet server.\n\nPHP source code for the botnet server is avaible in the 'botnet' folder. The database engine\nused in this project is MySQL.\n\n\n-----\n\n## License\n\n[This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details](https://github.com/valsov/BackNet/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n\n-----",
