This report documented the observed evolution from\ntraditional 419-style email scams to the use of commodity malware for financial gain.\nOver the past two years, Palo Alto Networks has continued to collect thousands of\nsamples of malware associated with these actors. With this wealth of data, Unit 42\nrecently launched an unprecedented analytic effort to develop a current assessment\nof the size, scope and complexity of this threat.\n\nApplying advanced analytics across more than 8,400 samples resulted in the\nidentification of over 500 domains supporting malware activity and roughly\n100 unique actors or groups, which we continue to track under the code name\n“SilverTerrier.” This data exhibited that these actors’ ability to distribute malware has\ngrown steadily over the past two years to its current rate of 5,000–8,000 attacks\nper month. Moreover, using email as the primary means of distribution, the majority\nof these attacks were focused against the high technology, higher education and\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nWhile these attacks originate from actors with varying degrees of technical expertise,\nall of the actors continue to rely on commodity malware tools, which require minimal\ninfrastructure to set up and can be acquired on underground forums at nominal\ncosts. Historically, this fact has been used to draw assumptions regarding the\ntechnical competence of these actors; however, given our findings, we believe these\nassumptions may warrant reassessment.\n\nThrough our analysis, it has become clear that Nigerian cyber actors have\ndemonstrated significant growth in size, scope and capability over the past two\nyears. They have learned how to successfully apply simple malware tools with\nprecision in order to create substantial losses ranging from tens of thousands up to\nmillions of dollars for victim organizations, and they have broadened their scope well\nbeyond targeting unsuspecting individuals. As a result, these actors now pose\na formidable threat to businesses worldwide.\n\n### History\n\nOver the past three decades, the world has witnessed an evolution of fraud stemming\nfrom criminals operating within Nigeria. Starting in the early 1980s, millions of paper\nletters were distributed to unsuspecting recipients all over the world. These letters\noften followed the template of the historical, advance-fee type of scam in which\nrecipients were enticed to transfer funds or send their financial information in exchange\nfor generous returns or compensation. The stories behind these paper letter scams\n[continued to evolve through the 1980s, and with Laws of the Federation of Nigeria](http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-Part%20VI%20%20to%20the%20end.htm)\nbeing passed under military decree in 1990, they soon became known as “419 scams”\nbased on the section of criminal code that covered fraud.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the mid 1990s, telecom providers within the country began offering internet\nservices, and it didn’t take long for 419 scams to make the leap to this new medium.\nThe availability of email allowed scammers to rapidly tailor their schemes based on\ncurrent events, interact in near real-time with potential victims, and ultimately led to a\nsignificant increase in the magnitude of their distribution.\n\nThis trend continued to climb and, in 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n[released its annual Internet Crime Report listing Nigeria as third in the world for](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2008_IC3Report.pdf)\nconducting cybercriminal activity. While the country’s position on the list has\nfluctuated over the years, it once again claimed the number three position in\n[last year’s Internet Crime Report.](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2015_IC3Report.pdf)\n\nOver that same period, tactics and techniques continued to evolve, shifting gradually\nfrom the traditional 419 emails to schemes involving full websites designed to\nimpersonate legitimate entities. In July 2014, Unit 42 released a report called\n[419 Evolution documenting that Nigerian cybercriminals had officially incorporated](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/419evolution.html)\nmalware into their schemes.\n\n### Tools & Trends\n\nSince 2014, Nigerian actors have been linked to various popular malware tools,\nincluding Zeus, DarkComet and others. All of these tools have something in\ncommon: they are commodity malware tools that require minimal infrastructure to\nset up and can be purchased at nominal costs on underground forums. Traditionally,\nthis fact has been used to justify assessments that suggest these actors lack the\ntechnical aptitude required for more advanced tools. But our research suggests\nthat these tools may be chosen intentionally to support easy scalability among a\ndistributed actor network similar to an organized crime model.\n\nAs these tools rise and fall in popularity (and more importantly, as detection rates\nby antivirus vendors improve), SilverTerrier actors have consistently adopted new\nmalware families and shifted to the latest packing tools available. Given this trend,\nthe focus of this report is on the Predator Pain, ISR Stealer, Keybase, ISpySoftware\nand Pony malware families, due to their current popularity among Nigerian actors.\n\nThese five tools range in cost from free to $35, depending on the version, capabilities\nand licensing requirements desired by the actor. Each tool produces malicious\nexecutable files that are designed either to provide remote access to a system\nor to steal credentials from a victim, with the majority of these variants targeting\nMicrosoft[®] Windows[®] operating systems.\n\nWhile the malware itself is not overly complex, these actors routinely rely on packing\nsoftware or “crypters” in order to obfuscate the code so that it won’t be identified\nby traditional antivirus solutions. In doing so, they are able to maintain a core set\nof cheap malware tools and infrastructure while only paying for secondary tools\ndesigned to disguise their malware as benign files. To that end, some actors have\nbeen observed employing the latest crypters they can gain access to, often using a\ntool for only a few weeks before upgrading or shifting to the next available tool.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalyzing their use of the five core malware tools, the ability of SilverTerrier actors to\ndistribute malware has grown steadily over time to its current level of 5,000–8,000\nattacks per month. However, in May 2016, they demonstrated the added ability to\nsurge distribution efforts by launching nearly 19,000 attacks in one month.\n\nNigerian Malware Activity\n\n\n**25000**\n\n**20000**\n\n\n**15000**\n\n**10000**\n\n\n**5000**\n\n**0**\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|Col22|Col23|Col24|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n\n**MONTHS**\n\nWhile the malware itself can be distributed at scale and in far greater numbers than\nobserved above, the benefits of doing so are often diminished for these actors. As\na basic principle, there is generally a correlation between the amount of malware\ndistributed and the time it takes for antivirus vendors to identify and block it. Thus,\nthese Nigerian actors have refined their attack methods over time from sending\nmalware in bulk across the internet to a more focused, deliberate and targeted\napproach. Specifically, our data showed that 86 percent of the malware samples\nanalyzed were observed in 20 or fewer attacks against Palo Alto Networks customers.\n\n\n**Number of Times Samples Were Observed**\n\n**3%**\n\n**3%**\n\n\n**8%**\n\n\n86%\n**1-20**\n\n**21-50**\n\n\n**51-100**\n\n\n**100+**\n\nThese targets fall across all lines of industry; however, the data shows that Nigerian\nactors are predominately targeting organizations in high technology, higher education\nand manufacturing. This pattern represents a significant departure from traditional\n\n\n-----\n\nNigerian criminal activity, which historically has been focused on individuals and petty\ncrime, to a much more substantial threat for the international community, targeting\neverything from small businesses to major corporations.\n\nTop 5 Industries\n\n|High Tech Higher Educ Manufacturi Healthcare Constructio|ation ng n|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n**0** **5000** **10000** **15000** **20000** **25000** **30000**\n\n\n**ATTACKS**\n\n### Who Are They?\n\n\nUsing AutoFocus™ contextual threat intelligence, combined with advanced analytic\npractices, Unit 42 is currently tracking roughly 100 Nigerian cyber actors responsible for\noperating the infrastructure associated with the five malware families identified above.\nThese actors were predominately identified using domain registration details, which, in\nmany cases, enabled Unit 42 to link these actors directly to their social media profiles.\nPerforming this practice on a large scale has produced tremendous insights into the size,\nscope, motivations and interactions of these actors.\n\n#### What Do We Know About These Actors?\n\n\n**They are comfortable. The actors we have identified are individuals predominately from**\nthe cities of Owerri, Lagos, Enugu, Warri and Port Harcourt in the southwest/coastal region\nof Nigeria. The majority of these actors continue to reside in these cities, close to friends\nand family, where they live comfortably on the proceeds of their criminal activity (particularly\ngiven the favorable exchange rate between foreign currency and the Nigerian naira).\nAdditionally, some of the more successful actors have begun traveling abroad to European\nand Asian countries. The two most popular locations appear to be the United Kingdom and\nMalaysia where many of these individuals quickly reestablish their criminal operations.\n\n**They are educated. Many of them have attended technical secondary schools and have**\ngone on to obtain undergraduate degrees from the Federal University of Technology\n(FUTO) or other regionally aligned university systems offering technical degree programs.\n\n\n**They aren’t kids. These individuals range in age from late teenage years to adults**\nin their mid-40s, thus representing a wide range of generations participating in this\ncriminal activity. Historical domain data revealed that the older generations consist of\n\n\n-----\n\nindividuals who were once successful at launching 419 email campaigns and\nimpersonating legitimate government, financial, manufacturing and international\nfreight organizations to support their schemes. The younger generations represent\nthose graduating fresh out of the universities, who are beginning their criminal\ncareers with malware, while building off the scamming techniques developed by the\nolder generation. Together, these groups are blending their tools and techniques to\nachieve their goals. However, while the tools these actors use are relatively simple,\ntheir employment of the tools indicates a clear level of refinement, precision and\nsophistication.\n\n**They aren’t necessarily hiding. While a small subset of the actors go to great**\nlengths to conceal their identities, the culture within Nigeria tends to provide\na permissive environment for these types of illicit activities. Scams, fraud and\ncorruption are viewed as a way of life, and as a result, the majority of these actors\napply little effort toward maintaining anonymity. Instead they frequently combine\nfake names, aliases or nicknames with local addresses, phone numbers and\npersonal email accounts in order to register their malicious domains. In most cases,\nthese attributes can easily be linked back to their well-developed online social\nprofiles. These profiles include Google[®], Hotmail and Yahoo![®] email addresses, as\nwell as social media accounts on Facebook[®], Google+™, YouTube™ and, to a lesser\nextent, LinkedIn[®] and Twitter[®]. Across their social media accounts, many of these\nactors claim to be “self-employed,” while their profiles document their education,\ntheir associates, and openly flaunt their success through pictures of nice cars, gold\nchains and foreign currency.\n\n**They are becoming organized. Various actors are communicating, cooperating, and**\nsharing tools and techniques. The individuals who maintain the technical aptitude to\nestablish malware infrastructure either operate individually or lead teams of lessskilled actors. Those operating individually are connected through social media to\nother local actors with similar skills, as well as international actors using the same\ntools. Likewise, those leading teams maintain the same social network connections\nbut are often referred to as “boss” on their social media profiles by the actors\nthey support. A prime example can be seen in a recent threat report released by\n[SecureWorks[®] in which one actor was discovered to be supporting upward of](https://www.secureworks.com/research/wire-wire-a-west-african-cyber-threat)\n30 subordinates. In this arrangement, the boss typically registers the malware\ninfrastructure, establishes a folder structure to support each subordinate, and then\nprovides training on the tools, likely in exchange for a portion of the profits.\n\nWhile Unit 42 has identified roughly 100 individuals with the skills required to\nestablish this type of malware infrastructure, our data similarly showed that a\nsmall subset of these actors appear to be leading teams of between 4 and 30\nsubordinate actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Social Media Networks\n\nThe majority of SilverTerrier actors are very active on social media, with the two most\nprevalent networks being Facebook and Google+. However, while both of these\nnetworks provide a means for individuals to express themselves and share ideas,\nNigerian actors use them to accomplish two distinctly different purposes.\n\nFor these actors, Facebook accounts typically represent legitimate depictions of their\npersonal lives. These profiles contain their true names, links to family members, and\nconnections to friends from their high school, college and hometown. In that mix, one\ntypically finds links to local law enforcement, educational mentors and community\nreligious leaders, as well as their criminal peers and subordinates. Additionally, while\nthese profiles often contain images flaunting wealth and success, they tend to contain\nvery few blatant links to criminal activity or tools. Of course, there are a few instances\nin which connections claim affiliation with the Anonymous hacking group, or users are\nattempting to sell malware tools on their wall, but by and large, this activity is generally\nan exception rather than the norm on Facebook’s platform.\n\nFigure 1 + Examples of SilverTerrier actors flaunting success on Facebook\n\nConversely, the actors’ Google+ profiles appear to be built for the purpose of\nsupporting their illegitimate activities. While their Facebook profiles are linked to\ntheir personal email addresses, their Google+ profiles are most often linked to email\naccounts used to register malicious domains. As a result, these accounts typically\ncontain fewer than ten connections, most of which are to other nefarious individuals\nor organizations. Furthermore, this platform serves as a conduit in connecting local\ncriminals to international tools and capabilities while maintaining some degree of\nprivacy and anonymity. By mapping this network, Unit 42 has successfully identified\nthe linkage between Nigerian actors and such tools as NanoCore Remote Access\nTrojan, HawkEye Keylogger, Aegis Crypter and Orway Crypter.\n\nMore importantly, this mapping effort has enabled the identification of a small\nnumber of individuals who appear to serve as the connective tissue between various\nsubsets of Nigerian actors and the tools they use. While these individuals have not\nbeen linked directly to malware infrastructure themselves, conclusions about their\n\n\n-----\n\nimportance and overall role with respect to Nigerian cybercrime can be deduced\nsimply from their connections. This analysis thus informs a generic understanding of\nthe network that looks like this:\n\n**Tools, Capabilities**\n**and Resources**\n\n**Key Links**\n\n**Nigerian**\n**Actors**\n\nFigure 2 + Simplified depiction of Google+ social network\n\nWith an understanding of this generic model, it becomes possible to create products\nthat blend the information provided by both platforms. Doing so produces a wealth\nof insights into these criminal organizations. Most notably, this method can be used\nto establish connections between aliases on Google+ and actors’ true identities on\nFacebook. Once these links are established, second order analysis can easily be\nconducted to identify commonalities, degrees of separation, and levels of influence\nbetween organizations and individual actors. One such example can be seen below:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Current Tactics\n\nAt any point in time, many of these actors are engaged in multiple categories of\nscams ranging from their traditional 419 emails, to fake websites, to the most\nrecent malware initiatives. Thus, in order to account for the range of their activities,\nit becomes necessary to discuss the domains that SilverTerrier actors are building to\nsupport their activities. These domains can be grouped into three generic categories:\nself-named, fake organizations, and impersonation of legitimate organizations.\n\n#### Self-Named\n\nThese domains either have a personal meaning to the actor that is not readily\napparent to an outside observer, or they contain names that are linked directly to\nthe actor’s identity. For example, an actor using the alias of “Spy” and an\norganization of “Kabospy” established the following three domains: Kabospy[.]com,\nKabospy1[.]com and Kabospyz[.]com. In this case, these three domains were all\nused to support malware activities; however, this category has also been observed\nas having the widest scope of use overall. Depending on the specific actor in\nquestion, these domains range in use from seemingly legitimate activities, to\nfrauds and scams, to supporting malware.\n\n#### Fake Organizations\n\nThe concept of standing up fake organizations is a trend that expanded in the gap\nbetween traditional 419 email scams and their adaptation to malware, but it remains\npopular among Nigerian actors today given the versatility that these sites provide.\nThese domains are typically configured with a full-service website in order to\npresent a legitimate front to their viewers. Historically, this concept was focused on\nthe creation of fake financial institutions in order to defraud unsuspecting victims.\nRecently, we have seen instances of this trend expanding to incorporate other\nindustries, including manufacturing companies and, in some instances, charities in\norder to support both fraud and malware campaigns. It is also important to note that,\nover the course of the past few years, these websites have evolved in complexity.\nEarly attempts by the actors to develop these websites often included grammatical\nerrors and clunky interfaces that led average computer users to question the nature\nof the websites. Modern versions now demonstrate an enhanced level of web\ndesign proficiency and project a more professional appearance.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs an example, the following two websites are registered to the same Nigerian actor.\nLooking at each website independently, both appear to be professional products.\nLinks are active, the search bar works, and they contain contact information, a map of\nLondon, pictures, and biographies of company leadership. However, upon inspecting\nthe websites as a pair, it quickly becomes evident that they are mirror images of one\nanother, with only slight discrepancies. References to “Mg & Associates” stand out,\nand the profiles of company leadership also prove to be suspect as they are reused\nacross various websites owned by this actor.\n\nFigure 4 + www.kaequipments[.]com\n\nFigure 5 + www.ghequipments[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nSeparately, this next example represents an illegitimate charity. While the site\npresents an appearance consistent with what one might expect from a charitable\norganization, a closer look reveals a number of discrepancies that should raise\nalarms. For contact information, the main office in the United Kingdom is actually\na facility that provides temporary and virtual office space. Similarly, their location in\nthe United States is a non-existent address that resolves to a parking lot associated\nwith a major corporation. Lastly, the donation page indicates that it is under\nconstruction, but visitors are encouraged to make donations through Western Union\nor MoneyGram.\n\nFigure 6 + www.vintageorphanagelimited[.]com\n\n#### Impersonating Legitimate Organizations\n\nThe last category is comprised of domains that are designed to impersonate\nlegitimate organizations. Organization names for these domains are slightly modified\nfrom their real-world counterparts, and in most instances, the domains do not contain\nfunctioning user-friendly websites. Instead, these domains are used to host email\nservices in support of malware distribution, or they provide command-and-control\n(C2) services for malware to post stolen user credentials.\n\nSilverTerrier actors have been observed using this technique to impersonate\norganizations in the healthcare, education, sports, technology, public transportation,\ninternational freight and finance industries. More concerning is the fact that\nrecently this technique has expanded to include the full spectrum of government\norganizations, including law enforcement, military and diplomatic entities.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following represents a small sample of these domains registered by Nigerian\nactors to support fraudulent activities:\n\n\nUnited States Army ArmyDepartment[.]us\n\n\n#### Email Distribution\n\nOf the thousands of samples analyzed by Unit 42, the overwhelming majority of\nmalware was distributed to target organizations through email. These email messages\nfollowed two distinctly different patterns depending on the target of the attack.\n\nWhen targeting individuals, these emails provided a direct value proposition to their\ntargets. In this case, emails generally originated from impersonated shipping, banking\nor law enforcement organizations. For example, when shipping companies were used,\nemails informed their recipients that a package was pending delivery, and attached\nwas a malware file disguised as a tracking confirmation document. Emails appearing\nto come from banking organizations often contained subjects indicating an issue\npertaining to a refund or transfer of funds. When law enforcement organizations were\nused, the emails contained attachments that were crafted to look like evidence relating\nto the target. Over a period of five days in May 2016, this specific approach was seen\nin over 6,800 emails sent with a subject of “Warning from the FBI” and an attachment\ncalled “Your File.exe,” which was, in fact, Predator Pain malware.\n\nSeparately, when targeting businesses and large organizations, the emails were sent\nfrom impersonated business partners or those seeking to initiate future business\nprospects with the target organization. Additionally, in cases of Business Email\nCompromise (BEC), emails originated from compromised accounts internal to the\norganization. While these emails contained a wide variation of subjects and filename\ncombinations, they all tended to align with the general themes of invoices, purchase\norders, new orders, and requests for quotes.\n\n### Motivation\n\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC) and Business Email Spoofing (BES) are two\nattack techniques that have recently gained popularity among SilverTerrier actors.\nIn both approaches, the actors employ methods designed to fool victims into\nauthorizing electronic bank transfers. The subtle difference between the two is that\nBES involves the use of fake email accounts, whereas BEC attacks typically use\ncompromised accounts or systems from victim organizations. Common usage of the\nterm “BEC” typically refers to both methods.\n\n\n-----\n\nHistory has shown that the behavior of these actors has traditionally been financially\nmotivated for personal gain. Fraudulent websites and 419 email scams both provide a\nsteady stream of income consistent with their motivations. However, the success of\nthese tactics is generally constrained by the overall wealth of their individual victims.\nConversely, the allure of BEC is that it targets organizations rather than individuals.\nAs a direct result, the return on investment for targeting organizations is generally\nsignificantly higher.\n\nThat said, our dataset enables the identification of individual attacks and the\ntechniques used, but it lacks the details associated with the actors’ monetization\nefforts, as those are typically only known by the victim organizations. However,\ngiven the fact that these techniques are known to be prevalent among Nigerian\nactors, and their domain registration activity is also indicative of BEC activity, it is our\nassessment that these actors are likely using the methods described above in order\nto support BEC schemes for personal gain.\n\n### Victims\n\nThe ability to provide accurate metrics for the victims of these attacks presents a\nunique challenge for cybersecurity analysts. This information is clearly valuable, as it\nsupports the capability to quantify the level of success being achieved by Nigerian\nactors. However, the issue lies in distinguishing between individuals and organizations\nthat were targets of these attacks, as compared with the organizational systems that\nwere actually compromised by the malware. Most security vendors have ample data\non which of their customers were targeted and how those attacks were launched.\nYet, the ability of a security vendor to track victim metrics depends entirely on the\nvictim’s 1) ability to identify the malware infection, and more importantly, 2) willingness\nto acknowledge and report the compromise in an environment where doing so often\nresults in negative impacts to their business model. Given these constraints, drawing\nconclusions concerning victims and the overall success rates of Nigerian actors is\nbest achieved through a review of recent reports, law enforcement actions, and any\ninformation that can be obtained from malicious domains.\n\n[As a starting point, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) publishes an](https://www.ic3.gov/media/annualreports.aspx)\nannual report that documents the trends associated with United States’ victims\nwho have reported losses as a result of criminal cyber activity. While these reports\ndo not draw distinctions between the perpetrators of malware losses, they do\noutline specific metrics associated with traditional 419 scams, which shed light on\n[the historical successes that these actors have seen. In 2001, Nigerian 419 scams](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2001_IFCCReport.pdf)\nrepresented 15.5 percent of the total reports received, with the average loss per\nvictim being $5,575. Over the years, these numbers have declined as internet users\n[have become more aware of the threat. In 2008, Nigerian actors represented only](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2008_IC3Report.pdf)\n7.5 percent of the total reports received with the average loss dropping to $1,650\nper victim. While this seems like a positive trend, last year’s report sought to provide\nadditional quantification in order to draw contrast between average losses and total\n[losses. Overall in 2015, there were 30,855 victims of 419/Overpayment scams,](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2015_IC3Report.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nresulting in losses in excess of $49 million. While those numbers are significant, the\ngains achieved through current malware and BEC schemes appear to be far greater.\n[On August 1, 2016, Interpol released a press report detailing the arrest of a Nigerian](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2016/N2016-099)\nactor named “Mike.” According to the report, he is believed to be responsible for\nworldwide losses in excess of $60 million with over $15.4 million originating from\njust one victim.\n\n[Separately, on August 4, 2016, researchers from SecureWorks released a report](https://www.secureworks.com/research/wire-wire-a-west-african-cyber-threat)\nidentifying another group of Nigerian actors actively using malware to support BEC\nactivity. In this case, one of the criminals was infected with the malware, thus\naffording the researchers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the criminal\norganization. What they found was that the group had one individual who provided\nall of the technical support, infrastructure and training to more than 30 subordinates.\nCombined, this one group has gains estimated at $3-6 million per year, with an\naverage loss for victim businesses of $30,000 to $60,000.\n\nShifting focus to the victims themselves, a review of the publicly available\ninformation hosted on active, but misconfigured, malware servers provided many\ninteresting insights. While this approach only worked on a very small subset of the\nover 500 malware domains associated with these actors, the results showed that, on\naverage, each domain contained victim data for between 5 and 15 organizations, thus\ninforming a rough estimate of potentially 2,500 to 7,500 victims worldwide.\n\nThe majority of the victims were located in the Middle East and Asia, with a smaller\nsubset in Europe and North America. All of the victims ran Microsoft Windows\noperating systems, many of which contained traditional endpoint antivirus solutions.\nAdditionally, several of these systems were observed to contain timecard, billing and\ninventory software.\n\nIn almost every case, the victims were individual accounts on organizational and\nbusiness computers rather than personal computers. In some cases, the malicious\nemails were sent to generic business accounts (info@organization[.]com), and in\nothers, they were sent to specific users (user@organization[.]com). These emails\noriginated from a wide array of sources to include spoofed and compromised\naccounts. For example, in one instance, the malicious email originated from an\naccount appearing to belong to a foreign law enforcement official.\n\nThe victim organizations also ranged in size from small to medium-sized businesses\nwith both local and global footprints. These organizations largely aligned with\nmanufacturing, construction and other sales-oriented industries. However, while\nNigerian actors focus their malware efforts against targets they believe to be\nprofitable, this activity is sometimes indiscriminate and can result in significant\nsecondary impacts to the international community. For example, one such victim\nidentified by Unit 42 was an organization that serves as the intermediary between\ninternational telecom providers and their national government, in order to shape\ndomestic policy. In cases such as these, the risks to society become an order of\nmagnitude greater, ultimately placing these cyber actors on a different playing\nfield from those traditionally thought of as low-level cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOver the past two years, Nigerian cybercriminal activity transitioned from 419-style\nscams to the active deployment of malware. What started as a small group of actors\nin 2014 has now grown to over 100 individuals, resulting in substantial year-after-year\ngrowth in this line of criminal activity.\n\nOver the same period, multiple security vendors have produced reports documenting\nthe actions of individual Nigerian actors and groups. Given the evidence available,\nthese reports often implied a correlation between the simplicity of the malware tools\nused and the overall competence of the actors. Because of this trend, if CEOs were\nto ask their IT staff today whether they would consider Nigerian actors to be a threat,\nthe answer they would likely hear is: “No, they use unsophisticated tools that are\nboth easily detected and defeated.” Yet, when the scope of research is expanded\nbeyond a singular case to encompass more than 100 actors and groups, Unit 42\nhas found evidence that suggests the contrary. Simple tools being employed with\na degree of precision and mastery should be worthy of concern, as they present a\nconsiderable threat.\n\nWhile next-generation security solutions are highly effective at identifying Nigerian\ncybercriminal activity, traditional antivirus solutions are far less successful. An\nanalysis of over 8,400 malware hashes submitted to VirusTotal showed an average\nidentification rate of only 52 percent across vendors. This presents challenges to\nbusinesses worldwide that rely on legacy endpoint products alone to protect their\nemployees when traveling outside the more sophisticated protections corporate\nnetworks typically provide.\n\nAdditionally, these actors are becoming organized; they are no longer individuals and\nsmall groups operating independently. Instead, SilverTerrier actors are using social\nmedia platforms to develop complex networks in support of their illicit activities.\nThese networks provide a means to efficiently share tools, techniques and best\npractices. Furthermore, these efforts have enabled these actors to develop links to\ninternational criminal groups while also providing an opportunity for them to obtain\nthe latest malware, packing software and tutorials. In this sense, they have begun to\ndemonstrate traits indicative of small-scale organized crime.\n\nFinally, these attacks have matured. Businesses have become the primary focus of\nNigerian cybercrime, and the losses have already proven to be substantial. Proof of\nan individual actor’s ability to steal $60 million, as well as evidence that groups using\nthese techniques have been successful at stealing $3–6 million annually, should be\nconsidered a measure of their criminal competence.\n\nBecause of these traits, it is our assessment that Nigerian actors have demonstrated\na clear growth in size, scope, complexity and capability over the past two years, and\nas a direct result, they should now be regarded as a formidable threat to businesses\nworldwide.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Protection & Mitigation\n\nThe best defense against these evolving threats is a security posture that favors\nprevention. Customers of Palo Alto Networks are protected from this threat in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n1. Domains used by these actors have been flagged as malicious in Threat\nPrevention.\n\n2. WildFire™ threat analysis service accurately identifies samples associated with\nthese malware families.\n\nIn addition to these protections, organizations are also encouraged to review the\n[controls they have in place to prevent successful phishing attacks. Reeling in Those](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/reeling-in-those-pesky-phishing-attacks/)\n[Pesky Phishing Attacks is a great resource that provides a list of best practices.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/reeling-in-those-pesky-phishing-attacks/)\nHowever, more specifically, network security staff should also take steps to identify\nthe individuals within their organizations who manage “info@companyname[.]com”\nand similar accounts as well as the individuals who manage sales functions with\nnew clients. Given the tactics employed by Nigerian actors, special attention should\nbe given towards ensuring controls are in place to protect those employees from\ntailored phishing attempts and malware disguised as new orders.\n\nAutoFocus users can view malware associated with these attacks using the\n[PredatorPain, ISR Stealer, KeyBase, ISpySoftware and Pony tags or the SilverTerrier](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Commodity.PredatorPain)\ncampaign tag.\n\nA complete list of the malware domains associated with SilverTerrier actors can be\n[found on GitHub.](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/tree/master/silverterrier/domains.csv)\n\n\nwww.paloaltonetworks.com\n\n\n© 2016 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
