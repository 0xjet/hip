Like other human-operated ransomware gangs, the Mount Locker gang will\ncompromise networks, harvest unencrypted files to be used for blackmail, and then encrypt\nthe devices on the network.\n\nStolen data and the encrypted files are then used in a double-extortion scheme where\nvictims are warned that their stolen files will be published on a data leak site if a ransom is\nnot paid.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mount Locker data leak site**\n\n## New Mount Locker version targets TurboTax\n\nWith the tax season fast approaching, some are already gathering their tax information and\ninputting it into TurboTax to prepare for the April 15th tax deadline.\n\nIn a [new version of the ransomware analyzed by Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, Mount](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1329472284889919490)\nLocker is getting ready for the tax season as well by specifically targeting files used by the\nTurboTax tax software.\n\nWhen encrypting a computer, Mount Locker only encrypts files that have certain file\nextensions. With the latest version, the ransomware developers are now targeting\nthe .tax, .tax2009, .tax2013, and .tax2014 file extensions associated with the TurboTax tax\npreparation software.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Malware Locker targeting TurboTax extensions**\nWhile Mount Locker is oddly targeting file extensions for specific tax years, Kremez told\nBleepingComputer that the 'tax' targeting would match all extensions that contain the string.\n\nTo be safe from Mount Locker and other ransomware, be sure to make backups of your\nTurboTax files and other essential documents on detachable media after you make any\nchanges.\n\nSimply backing up your important files to a USB drive every night and then unplugging it will\nguarantee the safety of your files even if you suffer a ransomware attack.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Mount Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mount-locker/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Tax Return](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/tax-return/)\n[Taxes](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/taxes/)\n[TurboTax](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/turbotax/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
