While the](https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers/)\noriginal article didn’t mention Lazarus Group it was quickly picked up by security\nresearchers. Today we’d like to share some of our findings, and add something new to\nwhat’s currently common knowledge about Lazarus Group activities, and their connection to\nthe much talked about February 2016 incident, when an unknown attacker attempted to steal\nup to $851M USD from Bangladesh Central Bank.\n\nSince the Bangladesh incident there have been just a few articles explaining the connection\n[between Lazarus Group and the Bangladesh bank heist. One such publication was made](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.sg/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html)\navailable by BAE systems in May 2016, however it only included analysis of the wiper code.\n[This was followed by another blogpost by Anomali Labs, confirming the same wiping code](https://www.anomali.com/blog/evidence-of-stronger-ties-between-north-korea-and-swift-banking-attacks)\nsimilarity. This similarity was found to be satisfying to many readers, however at Kaspersky\nLab, we were looking for a stronger connection.\n\n\n-----\n\nOther claims that Lazarus was the group behind attacks on the Polish financial sector, came\nfrom Symantec in 2017, which noticed string reuse in malware at one of their Polish\ncustomers. Symantec also confirmed seeing the Lazarus wiper tool in Poland at one of their\ncustomers. However, from this it’s only clear that Lazarus might have attacked Polish banks.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9Vh2n6nC0t4\n\nWhile all these facts are fascinating, the connection between Lazarus attacks on banks, and\ntheir role in attacks on banks’ systems, was still loose. The only case where specific malware\ntargeting the bank’s infrastructure used to connect to SWIFT messaging server was\ndiscovered, is the Bangladesh Central Bank case. However, while almost everybody in the\nsecurity industry has heard about the attack, few technical details have been revealed to the\npublic based on the investigation that took place on site at the attacked company.\n[Considering that the afterhack publications by the media mentioned that the investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-10/bangladesh-bank-heist-probe-said-to-find-three-groups-of-hackers)\nstumbled upon three different attackers, it was not obvious whether Lazarus was the one\nresponsible for the fraudulent SWIFT transactions, or if Lazarus had in fact developed its\nown malware to attack banks’ systems.\n\nWe would like to add some strong facts that link some attacks on banks to Lazarus, and\nshare some of our own findings as well as shed some light on the recent TTPs used by the\nattacker, including some yet unpublished details from the attack in Europe in 2017.\n\nThis is the first time we announce some Lazarus Group operations that have thus far gone\nunreported to the public. We have had the privilege of investigating these attacks and\nhelping with incident response at a number of financial institutions in South East Asia and\nEurope. With cooperation and support from our research partners, we have managed to\n\n\n-----\n\naddress many important questions about the mystery of Lazarus attacks, such as their\ninfiltration method, their relation to attacks on SWIFT software and, most importantly, shed\nsome light on attribution.\n\nLazarus attacks are not a local problem and clearly the group’s operations span across the\nwhole world. We have seen the detection of their infiltration tools in multiple countries in the\npast year. Lazarus was previously known to conduct cyberespionage and cybersabotage\nactivities, such as attacks on Sony Pictures Entertainment with volumes of internal data\nleaked, and many system harddrives in the company wiped. Their interest in financial gain is\nrelatively new, considering the age of the group, and it seems that they have a different set of\npeople working on the problems of invisible money theft or the generation of illegal profit. We\nbelieve that Lazarus Group is very large and works mainly on infiltration and espionage\noperations, while a substantially smaller units within the group, which we have dubbed\nBluenoroff, is responsible for financial profit.\n\nThe watering hole attack on Polish banks was very well covered by media, however not\neveryone knows that it was one of many. Lazarus managed to inject malicious code in many\nother locations. We believe they started this watering hole campaign at the end of 2016 after\ntheir other operation was interrupted in South East Asia. Lazarus/Bluenoroff regrouped and\nrushed into new countries, selecting mostly poorer and less developed locations, hitting\nsmaller banks because they are, apparently, easy prey.\n\nTo date, we’ve seen Bluenoroff attack four main types of targets:\n\n\n-----\n\nFinancial institutions\nCasinos\nCompanies involved in the development of financial trade software\nCrypto-currency businesses\n\nHere is the full list of countries where we have seen Bluenoroff watering hole attacks:\n\nMexico\nAustralia\nUruguay\nRussian Federation\nNorway\nIndia\nNigeria\nPeru\nPoland\n\nOf course, not all attacks were as successful as the Polish attack case, mainly because in\nPoland they managed to compromise a government website. This website was frequently\naccessed by many financial institutions making it a very powerful attack vector. Nevertheless,\nthis wave of attacks resulted in multiple infections across the world, adding new hits to the\nmap we’ve been building.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the most interesting discoveries about Lazarus/Bluenoroff came from one of our\nresearch partners who completed a forensic analysis of a C2 server in Europe used by the\ngroup. Based on the forensic analysis report, the attacker connected to the server via\nTerminal Services and manually installed an Apache Tomcat server using a local browser,\nconfigured it with Java Server Pages and uploaded the JSP script for C2. Once the server\nwas ready, the attacker started testing it. First with a browser, then by running test instances\nof their backdoor. The operator used multiple IPs: from France to Korea, connecting via\nproxies and VPN servers. However, one short connection was made from a very unusual IP\nrange, which originates in North Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the operator installed an off-the-shelf cryptocurrency mining software that should\ngenerate Monero cryptocoins. The software so intensely consumed system resources that\nthe system became unresponsive and froze. This could be the reason why it was not\nproperly cleaned, and the server logs were preserved.\n\nThis is the first time we have seen a direct link between Bluenoroff and North Korea. Their\nactivity spans from backdoors to watering hole attacks, and attacks on SWIFT servers in\nbanks of South East Asia and Bangladesh Central Bank. Now, is it North Korea behind all\nthe Bluenoroff attacks after all? As researchers, we prefer to provide facts rather than\nspeculations. Still, seeing IP in the C2 log, does make North Korea a key part of the Lazarus\nBluenoroff equation.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nLazarus is not just another APT actor. The scale of the Lazarus operations is shocking. It has\nbeen on a spike since 2011 and activities didn’t disappear after Novetta published the results\nof its Operation Blockbuster research, in which we also participated. All those hundreds of\nsamples that were collected give the impression that Lazarus is operating a factory of\nmalware, which produces new samples via multiple independent conveyors.\n\nWe have seen them using various code obfuscation techniques, rewriting their own\nalgorithms, applying commercial software protectors, and using their own and underground\npackers. Lazarus knows the value of quality code, which is why we normally see rudimentary\nbackdoors being pushed during the first stage of infection. Burning those doesn’t impact the\ngroup too much. However, if the first stage backdoor reports an interesting infection they\nstart deploying more advanced code, carefully protecting it from accidental detection on disk.\nThe code is wrapped into a DLL loader or stored in an encrypted container, or maybe hidden\n\n\n-----\n\nin a binary encrypted registry value. It usually comes with an installer that only attackers can\nuse, because they password protect it. It guarantees that automated systems – be it a public\nsandbox or a researcher’s environment – will never see the real payload.\n\nMost of the tools are designed to be disposable material that will be replaced with a new\ngeneration as soon as they are burnt. And then there will be newer, and newer, and newer\nversions. Lazarus avoids reusing the same tools, same code, and the same algorithms.\n“Keep morphing!” seems to be their internal motto. Those rare cases when they are caught\nwith same tools are operational mistakes, because the group seems to be so large that one\npart doesn’t always know what the other is doing.\n\nThis level of sophistication is something that is not generally found in the cybercriminal world.\nIt’s something that requires strict organisation and control at all stages of operation. That’s\nwhy we think that Lazarus is not just another APT actor.\n\nOf course such processes require a lot of money to keep running, which is why the\nappearance of the Bluenoroff subgroup within Lazarus was logical.\n\nBluenoroff, being a subgroup of Lazarus, is focusing on financial attacks only. This subgroup\nhas reverse engineering skills because they spend time tearing apart legitimate software,\nand implementing patches for SWIFT Alliance software, in attempts to find ways to steal big\nmoney. Their malware is different and they aren’t exactly soldiers that hit and run. Instead,\nthey prefer to make an execution trace to reconstruct and quickly debug the problem. They\nare field engineers that come when the ground is already cleared after conquering new\nlands.\n\nOne of Bluenoroff’s favorite strategies is to silently integrate into running processes without\nbreaking them. From the code we’ve seen, it looks as if they are not exactly looking for a hit\nand run solution when it comes to money theft. Their solutions are aimed at invisible theft\nwithout leaving a trace. Of course, attempts to move around millions of USD can hardly\nremain unnoticed, but we believe that their malware might be secretly deployed now in many\nother places and it isn’t triggering any serious alarms because it’s much more quiet.\n\nWe would like to note, that in all of the observed attacks against banks that we have\nanalyzed, SWIFT software solutions running on banks’ servers haven’t demonstrated or\nexposed any specific vulnerability. The attacks were focused on banking infrastructure and\nstaff, exploiting vulnerabilities in commonly used software or websites, bruteforcing\npasswords, using keyloggers and elevating privileges. However, the way banks use servers\nwith SWIFT software installed requires personnel responsible for the administration and\noperation. Sooner or later, the attackers find these personnel, gain the necessary privileges,\nand access the server connected to the SWIFT messaging platform. With administrative\naccess to the platform they can manipulate software running on the system as they wish.\nThere is not much that can stop them, because from a technical perspective, their activities\nmay not differ from what an authorized and qualified engineer would do: starting and\n\n\n-----\n\nstopping services, patching software, modifying the database. Therefore, in all the breaches\nwe have analyzed, SWIFT, as an organization has not been at direct fault. More than that,\nwe have witnessed SWIFT trying to protect its customers by implementing the detection of\ndatabase and software integrity issues. We believe that this is a step in the right direction\nand these activities should be extended with full support. Complicating the patches of\nintegrity checks further may create a serious threat to the success of future operations run by\nLazarus/Bluenoroff against banks worldwide.\n\nTo date, the Lazarus/Bluenoroff group has been one of the most successful in launching\nlarge scale operations against the financial industry. We believe that they will remain one of\nthe biggest threats to the banking sector, finance and trading companies, as well as casinos\nfor the next few years. We would like to note that none of the financial institutions we helped\nwith incident response and investigation reported any financial loss.\n\nAs usual, defense against attacks such as those from Lazarus/Bluenoroff should include a\nmulti-layered approach. Kaspersky products include special mitigation strategies against this\ngroup, as well as the many other APT groups we track.
