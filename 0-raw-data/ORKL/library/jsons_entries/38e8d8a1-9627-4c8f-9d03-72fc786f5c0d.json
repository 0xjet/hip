Scope\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### Introduction and Scope\n\n\n#### 1. Introduction and Scope\n\n###### 1.1 Introduction\n\nEmergency shutdown (ESD) is a design feature that is used in process systems to reduce risk. In the liquefied gas\nindustry, ESD is a safety system that is designed to minimise the consequences of an incident. This document is\nthe outcome of a review of ESD systems on liquefied gas carriers.\n\nAlthough ESD systems are distinct on gas carriers, they interact with other safety systems on the ship and\nterminal[1]. Related safety systems include overflow control, ship shore link (SSL), vacuum protection, gas burning\nsafety systems (GBSS) and emergency release systems (ERS).\n\nThis document discusses the requirements of the IGC Code[2] for ESD and related safety systems and\nrecommends additional measures. To help explain those recommendations, descriptions of the relevant safety\nsystems are given.\n\nThis new document updates and replaces the previous publication, ESD Arrangements & Linked Ship/Shore\n_Systems for Liquefied Gas Carriers (2009). This update benefits from advancements in safety philosophy,_\ntechnological improvements and lessons learnt from incidents.\n\n1 _Terminal refers to all receiving and exporting facilities, including floating and regasification facilities_\n\n2 IMO – International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (Reference 1)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Introduction and Scope\n\n\n###### 1.2 Scope\n\nThis document is written at a level suitable for organisations involved in the design, integration and use of ESD\nand related safety systems on liquefied gas carriers and terminals. The guidance is written at a high level and\nassumes the reader is technically qualified and experienced in this subject.\n\nThe recommendations in this document are for new gas carriers and terminals only and are not intended for\nexisting gas carriers or terminals. Shipyards, system designers and owners of ships and terminals should review\nthese recommendations when carrying out a major upgrade to ESD and related safety systems on an existing\nship or terminal.\n\nThe primary focus of this document is ESD systems for gas carriers, but it does provide minimum\nrecommendations for related safety systems where necessary. This document does not provide substantial\nguidance for terminal ESD and ERS. Although the guidance in this document is particularly relevant to liquefied\ngas transfers, it may not be particularly relevant to regasification gas transfer operations.\n\nAn overview of ESD linked systems is provided, but this document does not recommend any particular system.\nThe owner should decide which system, or combination of systems, is suitable for their asset.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2\n\n Key Safety System Philosophies\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### Key Safety System Philosophies\n\n\n#### 2. Key Safety System Philosophies\n\nThere are key philosophies that guide the design of safety systems and these can be found in the IGC Code[3 ]\n\nand the relevant IEC and ISO documents it references. This section will provide a high-level summary of some of\nthe important concepts.\n\n###### 2.1 System Segregation\n\nAlthough the IGC Code does not use layer of protection analysis (LOPA) terminology, it is helpful to use this\nconcept to visualise the layers that the various systems form. A typical independent layer of protection diagram\nis shown in Figure 1.\n\n6. Emergency response\n\nMitigation\n\n5. Physical protection\nsystems\n\n4. Safety system\n\n3.

Design\n\n**Figure 1: Typical independent layers of protection**\n\nThe control, monitoring and safety systems on a gas carrier can provide distinct and successive layers of\nprotection. As a general concept, when the control of a process is not managed within a specific layer, then the\nnext layer above is activated.\n\nAlthough not in chronological order for a specific hazard, Table 1 contains examples of the systems found in\ndifferent layers.\n\n**Layer** **System**\n\n2.

Physical protection systems|Cargo tank relief valve|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Key Safety System Philosophies\n\n\nThe systems within the cargo transfer process can be categorised according to their functions. Identifying the\ncategory of a system is important, as it dictates the requirements for that system. The IEC and ISO documents\nreferenced in IGC Code 13.8 Automation systems provide valuable information and this document makes\nparticular reference to IEC 60092-504[4] for design and testing of these safety systems.\n\n###### 2.2 Independent and Fail-safe\n\nThe key requirements for safety systems are that they are independent and fail-safe. Independent means\nthat a failure in one part of the system will not affect the other. The degree of independence required will be\ndetermined by the Flag State but, typically, this need not extend to high-level power sources or conduit piping.\n\nThe safety systems discussed in this document, such as the ESD system, vacuum protection and overflow control,\nprovide a safety function and are required to be independent from control and monitoring or alarm functions.\nThey are, typically, programmable logic controller (PLC) based systems and should comply with IGC Code 13.8\n_Automation systems and IGC Code 13.9 System integration. The use of recognised standards IEC 15288[5] and_\n_ISO 17894[6] is also recommended._\n\nFail-safe means that any failure will not lead to an unsafe condition. For example, fail-safe of the ESD system\nwould stop the movement of cargo by stopping pumps, compressors and closing valves.\n\n###### 2.3 System Availability\n\nESD is an important safety system and it should always be active when there is any cargo on the ship. The ESD\nsystem should only be switched off for short periods of time for necessary maintenance. It may be inhibited\ntemporarily for testing, but this should be for the minimum duration possible.\n\nIf the design of a safety system or ESD system leads the operator to switch it off unintentionally or\ninappropriately then the reason for this should be thoroughly investigated. This should include whether the\ndesign of the system can be adjusted to reduce the risk of this occurring again.\n\nThe ESD system should be designed to clearly indicate[7] when it is inhibited or switched off and it should not\npermit cargo transfer operations in these conditions.\n\nCargo control systems should be designed to not permit cargo transfer operations unless the ESD system and\nship shore link (SSL) are connected and active. The status of the ESD and SSL systems should be clearly visible\nin the cargo control room (CCR). Ship and terminal operators should ensure that all relevant safety systems,\nincluding ESD and SSL systems, are fully operational and active during cargo transfer operations.\n\n###### 2.4 Alarm Management Lifecycle\n\nThe requirements of the IGC Code are prescriptive in nature and the scope of the safety functions it covers may\nbe sufficient for most gas carriers. However, for some designs of gas carriers, additional safety functions may\nbe advisable. It is important to review the need for additional safety functions in a structured manner and follow\n\n4 IEC 60092-504 – Electrical installations in ships – Part 504: Automation, control and instrumentation (Reference 2)\n\n5 IEC 15288 – Systems and software engineering – System life cycle processes (Reference 3)\n\n6 \u0007ISO 17894 – Ships and marine technology – Computer applications – General principles for the development and use of programmable electronic\n\nsystems in marine applications (Reference 4)\n\n7 Refer to SIGTTO – Recommendations for Management of Cargo Alarm Systems – 16. Critical Alarm and Action Panel (Reference 5)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Key Safety System Philosophies\n\n\nindustry standard best practice. Human factors should also be considered and potential dangers such as alarm\n_flooding[8] should be avoided._\n\nAny change to the alarm system on the ship should be carried out using the principles of the alarm\nmanagement lifecycle in IEC 62682[9]. Any changes to the alarm system should only be made by undergoing\na documented process that involves a full hazard and operability (HAZOP) study and a management of\nchange process.\n\n###### 2.5 Maintenance and Testing\n\nChapter 13 of the IGC Code requires automation systems to be designed, installed and tested in accordance\nwith recognised standards, with particular reference to IEC 60092-504. This provides guidance on the\nrequirements for documentation, maintenance and testing.\n\nSafety systems should be designed to ensure that it is practical to test all parts of the system. Operation and\nmaintenance documentation should provide clear guidance on how to test the safety system and the required\nintervals for this to ensure that the safety system is maintained in operational condition.\n\nThe IGC Code (18.6.2 and 18.10.5) requires cargo ESD and alarm systems to be tested before cargo transfer.\nThis is typically carried out as part of pre-arrival tests, in the 24 hours before berthing. The SSL is tested after\nconnection as part of pre-transfer tests.\n\n8 Refer to SIGTTO – Recommendations for Management of Cargo Alarm Systems (Reference 5)\n\n9 IEC 62682 – Management of alarm systems for the process industries (Reference 6)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## 3\n\n ESD Systems\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### ESD Systems\n\n\n#### 3. ESD Systems\n\nESD systems are safety systems that perform a critical function on a ship. This section provides a brief overview\nof IGC Code[10] requirements and gives recommendations for ESD systems, including testing. The ESD system\nrefers to the entire system, including remotely operated valves (ESD valves) and the ESD system logic controller\n(ESD controller).\n\n###### 3.1 IGC Code Requirements\n\nTo understand the guidance in this document, it is recommended that the IGC Code requirements for ESD and\nrelated systems are read. For quick reference, notable current IGC Code requirements are listed in Annex 1. For\nESD, the requirements are grouped under ESD system, ESD valves and ESD controller headings.\n\nESD is a defined term in the IGC Code and should not be extended to cover every safety system that is used in\nan emergency. The IGC Code (5.5.1.2) states that:\n\n_“The ESD system is intended to return the cargo system to a safe static condition so that any remedial action can_\n_be taken”._\n\nIt is important to understand that ESD systems and related safety systems are distinct. The requirements for\nESD systems are typically found in IGC Code Chapters 5 and 18. Related systems are typically found in other\nIGC Code Chapters, such as Vacuum protection (Chapter 8), Overflow protection (Chapter 13) and Gas fuel\n(Chapter 18). Chapters 4 through to 7 in this document will address these systems, the ship shore link (SSL) and\nemergency release systems (ERS) in more detail.\n\n###### 3.2 Recommendations for ESD Systems\n\nThis section provides additional recommendations for and explanations of ESD systems. For related systems, see\nChapters 4 through to 7.\n\n**3.2.1 ESD valves**\n\nESD valves should be designed to close as quickly as possible, taking surge pressures into account. The IGC\nCode requires ESD valves to close within 30 seconds of actuation. This is measured from the time the pushbutton (eg as required by IGC Code 18.10.3.1) is pressed to activate ESD until the valve is fully closed. To allow\nfor some design tolerance, the range of 25 to 30 seconds is practical for ship valves.\n\nTerminals should adjust valve timings with consideration for ship design limitations. When a ship is loading,\nterminal valves should close before ship valves to ensure that surge pressure is managed at the terminal side.\nShips are generally not designed to withstand terminal surge pressures.\n\nIf receiving terminals set their ERS valves to close faster than 5 seconds, this may cause unacceptable pressure\nsurge on a ship that is discharging. For this reason, it is not recommended to set ERS valve closure timing at less\nthan 5 seconds.\n\nTable 2 gives suggested valve timings for ship loading and discharge operations. For ship to ship transfers, both\nships may keep their valve timing at between 25 to 30 seconds.\n\n10 IMO – International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (Reference 1)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ESD Systems\n\n|Col1|Ship ESD valves (seconds)|Terminal ESD valves (seconds)|Terminal ERS valves (seconds)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Ship loading|25 – 30|10 – 15|-|\n|Ship discharge|25 – 30|30 – 60|Minimum 5|\n\n\n**Table 2: Suggested valve timings**\n\nAlthough the IGC Code does not require ESD valves at the cargo tank for tanks 0.07 MPa and below, these are\nusually fitted in practice. Consequently, it is recommended to extend the IGC Code guidance and fit ESD valves\non all liquid and vapour lines, even for tanks 0.07 MPa and below.\n\nIt is useful to note that master gas valves (MGVs) are part of the gas burning safety system (GBSS), which is\ncovered by the IGC Code in Chapter 16. Although an MGV is similar to an ESD valve, it is not an ESD valve\nand is not part of the ESD system.\n\n**3.2.2 Liquid detection in the vent system**\n\nOn rare occasions, there is a possibility of cargo liquid presence in the vent system. This possibility is sufficiently\nserious to justify fitting additional liquid sensors to detect this event.\n\nAs there is very low probability of liquid in the vent system, these sensors should not generate spurious\nactivations. The design of the liquid sensors should prevent them from being overridden. The liquid sensors\nshould trigger a full ESD on detection of liquid. See Initiator 4 – Liquid detection (cargo vent) in Table 3.\n\nThese sensors should be placed in suitable locations in the vent system to detect the presence of liquid. The\nlocation of these sensors should be as close to the potential source as practicable. This will help to minimise\nthe amount of liquid that escapes into the vent system. Multiple locations may need to be fitted with sensors to\nachieve this goal.\n\nThese sensors should detect liquid directly, using a float type or equivalent method, and should not be based\non temperature or gas detection. The system should be designed so that it does not activate when only cargo\nvapour is present.\n\n**3.2.3 ESD function overview**\n\nThis section provides an overview of ESD systems. The primary functions of ESD are set by the IGC Code. The\ninterface of ESD with related systems can be seen in Table 3.\n\nAnalysis of credible scenarios helps to improve understanding of the necessary functions of a safety system.\nFor example, as shown in Figure 2, fire detection in the cargo area would most likely be the result of loss of\ncontainment of flammable cargo. In this circumstance, a suitable system should lead to full shutdown of cargo\ntransfer operations and any gas burning in the engine room.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ESD Systems\n\n|Push-button (ESD – 18.10.3.1)|Liquid detection in cargo vent system|\n|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||||\n|Cargo transfer is planned and monitored|||High-level alarm and operator action (13.3.1)|||Automatic actuate shutoff valve/ ESD (13.3.2)||\n\n|Hydrocarbon (methane/ propane) Unignited release Push-button Liquid detection Loss of Overflow of (ESD – in cargo Gas detection containment cargo tank 18.10.3.1) vent system Cargo transfer High-level alarm Automatic actuate is planned and and operator shutoff valve/ Ignited monitored action (13.3.1) ESD (13.3.2) release Refer to Fire detection Fire protection unignited (ESD – (water spray release barriers 18.10.3.2) system – 11.3)|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||Unignited release|\n||||||\n||Gas detection||||\n||||||\n|||||Ignited release|\n||Fire protection (water spray system – 11.3)||||\n||||||\n\n|Refer to unignited release barriers|Fire detection (ESD – 18.10.3.2)|\n|---|---|\n\n\nLoss of\ncontainment\n\n\nOverpressure\n\n\nProcess piping\nfailure\n\n\nUnignited\nrelease\n\n\nCold spill\n\n\nIgnited\nrelease\n\n\n**Figure 2: Simplified bowties for loss of containment[11]**\n\nIn the simplified bowties, it is clear that manual activation of ESD is a barrier on the right side (pushbutton 18.10.3.1). Barriers on the right are recovery barriers that are meant to mitigate the effects of the top\nevent (loss of containment). The design of gas carriers incorporates manual ESD activation as an important\naspect of the safety case.\n\nIn the above scenario, loss of containment is the point when control of the process has been lost. It is important\nthat personnel are trained to understand the exact point when control of the process has been lost and the\nimportance of manual ESD activation. This can reduce any hesitancy to manually activate the ESD push-button\nto stop work in an emergency.\n\nWhen the cargo ESD is activated, it is recommended to follow the IGC Code principle and “return the cargo\n_system to a safe static condition”. There are four initiators shown in Figure 3, but additional initiators may be_\nreceived from related systems, such as overflow control, vacuum protection and the GBSS.\n\n11 IMO – International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (Reference 1) – references in bowtie\n\n\nLoss of\ncontainment\n\n\nOverflow of\ncargo tank\n\n\nUnignited\nrelease\n\n\n-----\n\n##### ESD Systems\n\n\n**Figure 3: ESD system function**\n\nTable 3 provides a summary of ESD and related system functions on an LNG carrier.

The SSL (see Chapter 6)\nis tested after connection as part of pre-transfer tests.\n\nNot all ESD activation points need to be tested every time, as long as they are covered by a testing plan that\ncovers the entire system within a specified time frame. This testing plan should form part of the ship’s planned\nmaintenance routines. A formal system should be in place to demonstrate compliance with IGC Code 13.8.2\nand IEC 60092-504 Chapter 12.2[13].\n\nManifold ESD valves should be tested as part of the pre-arrival test and after manifold connection as part of the\n_pre-transfer test. See Section 6.4 Ship Shore Link Testing for discussion of manifold valve testing._\n\nESD valves should close within 25 to 30 seconds of activation, ie the time a manual push-button is pressed. This\nis the most accurate method for testing, as the activation of an electrical point does not introduce any significant\ndelay in the activation of the ESD system.\n\nPneumatic systems are a useful part of the ESD system, but the nature of their design means that they are not the\nmost straightforward activation point to test the ESD valve timing. This is because a variable delay is introduced\nin depressurising the system, so it is best to avoid this activation point for the purpose of checking the valve\ntiming, where possible.\n\nLiquid detection in the vent system should be function tested as part of the pre-arrival test. At this stage, a visual\ninspection should be carried out for water or debris that may have accumulated in the sensing chamber.\n\n13 IEC 60092-504 – Electrical installations in ships – Part 504: Automation, control and instrumentation (Reference 2)\n\n\n-----\n\n## 4\n\n Overflow Control and Vacuum Protection\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### Vacuum Protection\n\n\n#### 4. Overflow Control and Vacuum Protection\n\nOverflow control and vacuum protection are safety systems that perform a critical function on a ship. This\nsection provides a brief overview of IGC Code[14] requirements and gives recommendations for overflow control\nsystems, including testing.\n\n###### 4.1 IGC Code Requirements\n\n**4.1.1 Vacuum protection**\n\nVacuum protection systems are required for certain cargo tank designs. These systems consist of two\nindependent pressure switches that will send a signal to stop suction of liquid or vapour from the cargo tanks\n(IGC Code 8.3.1.1).\n\nThis requirement is distinct from ESD systems, as it is contained in Chapter 8 of the IGC Code, Vent systems for\n_cargo containment. This is a system designed to protect the cargo tank from damage. The function of vacuum_\nprotection systems may also be achieved by activating the ESD system (IGC Code 18.10.4.1). Figure 4 shows\nvacuum protection options.\n\nStop compressor (reliquefaction mode)\n\nVacuum protection (cargo tank) Stop compressor (cargo mode)\n\nStop pumps (cargo mode)\n\nActivate cargo ESD\n\n**Figure 4: Vacuum protection options**\n\n**4.1.2 Overflow control**\n\nChapter 13 of the IGC Code requires overflow control to be provided for cargo tanks using two sensors that are\nboth independent of the gauging system and of each other. For quick reference, notable requirements of the\ncurrent IGC Code have been listed in Annex 1.\n\nOverflow control is an independent safety system, but it may use the ESD system to achieve its function, as\nshown in Figure 5. To prevent a cargo tank from becoming liquid full, it may use an ESD valve. It may also\nactivate the ESD system for a full cargo shutdown to prevent excessive pressure in the loading line.\n\nOverflow control (cargo tank) Close valves (cargo tank)\n\nActivate cargo ESD\n\n**Figure 5: Overflow control options**\n\n14 IMO – International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (Reference 1)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Vacuum Protection\n\n\nThe alarm required by IGC Code 13.3.1 provides a warning that the cargo tank is approaching a high level.\nAs this sensor is independent of the gauging system, it can also serve to protect against level gauge failure. The\nsensor required by IGC Code 13.3.2 protects against overfilling caused by gauge failure, operator error or if\nthe tank filling valve leaks after being shut.\n\nThe section on overflow control also specifies verification, testing and interlock measures to reduce the risk of\nsensor failure.\n\n###### 4.2 Recommendations for Overflow Control\n\nAlthough the IGC Code does not require overflow control for all types of cargo tanks, this is usually fitted\nin practice. Consequently, it is recommended to exceed the scope of the IGC Code guidance and fit overflow\ncontrol for all cargo tanks, including any coolant tanks on deck.\n\nThe layers of protection and the possible degradation factors can be seen in the highly simplified bowtie\nin Figure 6. If the high-level alarm (IGC Code 13.3.1) and automatic shutoff valve (IGC Code 13.3.2) are\nindependent of the gauging system, and of each other, then they can fulfil the function of a barrier. By definition,\na preventative barrier should be able to stop the threat independently.\n\nOverflow of cargo Hydrocarbon\ntank (methane/propane)\n\nCargo transfer High-level alarm Automatic actuate\nis planned and and operator shutoff valve/\nmonitored action (13.3.1) ESD (13.3.2)\n\nLevel alarm sensor\nfail\n\nPeriodic proof Pre-operations\n\nLoss of\n\ntest (13.3.5) testing (18.10.5)\n\ncontainment\n\nLevel alarm sensor\nfail\n\nPeriodic proof Pre-operations\ntest (13.3.5) testing (18.10.5)\n\nLevel alarm\noverride on\n\nInterlock with Override is time\nmanifold valve limited to maximum\n(18.1, Table – Note 4) 45 seconds\n\n**Figure 6: Simplified bowtie showing overflow threat[15]**\n\nFailure of the overflow control system is shown as escalation factors and these are mitigated by pre-arrival\ntesting and periodic proof testing.\n\nOverflow control is an independent safety system, but it can make use of parts of the ESD system to achieve\nits function. For example, the shutoff valve on the cargo tank could be a dedicated valve for overflow control.\nHowever, if there is already an ESD valve at the cargo tank, then the overflow control can use this valve to\nachieve the function and operate the valve individually (ie without activating a full ESD).\n\n15 IMO – International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (Reference 1) – references in bowtie\n\n|Overflow of cargo tank|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||\n\n|High-level alarm and operator action (13.3.1)|Automatic actuate shutoff valve/ ESD (13.3.2)|\n|---|---|\n\n\nLoss of\ncontainment\n\n\nLevel alarm\noverride on\n\n\nLevel alarm sensor\nfail\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Vacuum Protection\n\n\nTo prevent excessive surge pressure, the automatic shutoff sensor (IGC Code 13.3.2) may activate the ESD\nsystem and cause a full cargo shutdown. This will also shut the relevant equipment in the terminal down via the\nSSL. See Initiator 6 – Overflow control (cargo tank) in Table 3.\n\nOverflow systems can be activated by liquid movement in the tanks at sea, so the system may need to\nincorporate an override function. This override function introduces a failure mode to the overflow control system.\nProtection against this failure mode should be considered in the design (IGC Code 13.3.7). The system should\nbe designed to clearly indicate[16] when the overflow control system is inhibited or switched off. It should not be\npossible to undertake cargo transfer operations during this condition.\n\nWhere possible, the override system should be designed so that it cannot be switched off completely. A time\ndelay should be set so that the overflow control will not activate at sea. The time delay will be unique to the\nship’s rolling period and should not normally exceed 45 seconds. This time delay should be kept to a minimum\nand the assumptions used in the calculation should be provided in the overflow control system documentation.\n\nThe status of the overflow control should be clearly visible in the cargo control room (CCR). Ship and terminal\noperators should ensure that all safety systems, including overflow control and vacuum protection systems, are\nfully operational and active during cargo transfer operations.\n\n###### 4.3 Testing of Overflow Control\n\nThe IGC Code has specific requirements for testing overflow control systems. A function test (IGC Code 13.3.6)\nshould be carried out prior to cargo operations. This may be carried out as per the manufacturer’s instructions\nfor a function test during the pre-arrival test.\n\nA proof test is a periodic test that is carried out to detect dangerous hidden faults in a safety system. The\noverflow control system should be proof tested (IGC Code 13.3.5) by raising the cargo liquid level at specified\nintervals. The cargo operational manual (IGC Code 18.2) should include a description of the procedure to test\nthe high-level alarm (IGC Code 13.3.5) in a safe and controlled manner.\n\nOverflow control systems are typically based on a float, ultrasonic or radar design. For overflow control that is\nactivated by a float-type sensor, failures caused by a damaged or punctured float can be identified by a proof\ntest (IGC Code 13.3.5). This type of test is the actual scenario that the overflow control system is designed to\nprotect against, so it also works for radar systems.\n\nAny alternate means of testing should clearly demonstrate how it is equivalent to a proof test. It should\ndocument how it addresses the possible failure modes that are specific to the system design. This alternate\nmeans of testing should be documented and would, typically, require Flag State approval.\n\n16 Refer to SIGTTO – Recommendations for Management of Cargo Alarm Systems – 16.

Gas Burning Safety System\n\nThe gas burning safety system (GBSS) performs a critical function. It is not part of the cargo system but, because\nit interfaces with the cargo ESD system, it is discussed here for completeness. This section does not provide\nrecommendations on the GBSS, but it offers explanations to support understanding of ESD.\n\n###### 5.1 IGC Code Requirements\n\nChapter 16 of the IGC Code[17] dictates the safety systems for the use of cargo as a fuel. For quick reference,\nnotable requirements of the current IGC Code have been listed in Annex 1.\n\nThe GBSS refers to the entire system, including the master gas valve (MGV) and individual gas consumer\nisolation, and trips for rotating and fuel supply equipment.\n\nChapter 16 specifies the initiators that would cause an MGV to shut. This may be for an individual gas\nconsumer or for the entire fuel gas system, depending on the ship design. The initiators are shown in Figure 7.\n\nMGV actuation failure\n\nLeak detection\n\nLoss of inert gas pressure\n\nLoss of ventilation\n\nGas detection Shut master gas valve (MGV)\n\nBoiler safety\n\nInternal combustion engine safety\n\nGas turbine safety\n\nPush-button (MGV close)\n\n**Figure 7: Initiators causing MGV to shut**\n\nChapter 16 of the IGC Code also specifies that push-buttons should be fitted to stop pumps and compressors\nthat are used in the fuel gas system, as shown in Figure 8.\n\n17 IMO – International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (Reference 1)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Gas Burning Safety System\n\n|Push-button (fuel mode)|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**Figure 8: Push-button activation**\n\nChapter 16 requires pumps and compressors that are used in the fuel gas system to stop on low suction pressure\nand fire detection in the engine room (Figure 9).\n\nLow suction pressure (fuel mode) Stop pumps (fuel mode)\n\nFire detection (engine room) Stop compressor (fuel mode)\n\n**Figure 9: Low suction pressure and fire detection in engine room**\n\n###### 5.2 Explanation of the GBSS and ESD Interface\n\nIn practice, the initiators for shutting an MGV and stopping pumps and compressors result in the activation\nof the GBSS, which may also activate cargo ESD. This is shown in Figure 10. See Initiator 10 – Low suction\n_pressure (fuel mode) in Table 3._\n\nShut MGV\n\nGas burning safety system (GBSS) Stop pumps (fuel mode)\n\nStop compressor (fuel mode)\n\nCargo ESD\n\n**Figure 10: GBSS activation**\n\n_Initiator 7 – Vacuum protection (cargo mode) and Initiator 10 – Low suction pressure (fuel mode) may be one_\nand the same protection on a membrane LNG carrier. Therefore, depending on the ship design, this may have\nthe effect of a full ESD.\n\nThe IGC Code 18.10 states that the cargo ESD system need not apply to gas fuel compressors or pumps. This is\npractical if the emergency is at the terminal and the ESD signal is received via the link.\n\nFor most serious situations on the cargo deck that would initiate a full ESD, such as fire in the compressor room\nor cargo tank overflow, it is safer to stop all cargo and vapour flow. Stopping the flow of liquid and vapour in\nan emergency is a key safety feature of the ESD system.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Gas Burning Safety System\n\n\nFigures 11 and 12 show how the barriers are located on a highly simplified bowtie example.

Ship Shore Link\n\nThe purpose of the ship shore link (SSL) is to mitigate the consequences of an emergency by allowing\neither party to stop cargo[20] transfer in a safe manner. This section provides a brief overview of IGC Code[21]\nrequirements and gives recommendations for the SSL, including testing.\n\n###### 6.1 IGC Code Requirements\n\nThe IGC Code (18.10.1.4) requires the ship’s ESD system to incorporate an SSL. The SSL extends the functionality\nof the ESD system by linking the ship and terminal.\n\nThe SSL helps to prevent surge pressure from damaging the piping system. It also reduces the amount of cargo\nthat is lost from its containment by reducing the time taken to stop pumps and shut valves.\n\n\nStop compressor (cargo mode)\n\n\nStop pumps (cargo mode)\n\n\nReceive ESD signal (from terminal) Send ESD signal (to terminal)\n\n\nClose valves (cargo manifold)\n\n\nClose valves (cargo tank)\n\n|Receive ESD signal (from ter minal)|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n|||\n\n\n**Figure 13: Ship shore link**\n\n###### 6.2 Recommendations\n\nWhen an ESD occurs on a ship or terminal, the SSL sends a signal via the link. The received signal should\ninitiate the shut down of the relevant parts of the cargo transfer system. When a ship or terminal receives an\nESD signal, it is recommended that the signal is sent back. This will help detection of failures in the SSL.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that all liquefied gas transfers are carried out with an SSL connected. The SSL adds\nsignificant safety improvement compared to cargo transfer operations carried out without a link or with an\nESD pendant.\n\nAll gas carriers that fall under the IGC Code, and terminals that are designed to receive them, are\nrecommended to ensure that cargo transfers are carried out using linked ESD systems. It is also recommended\nthat all ship to ship transfer operations use linked ESD systems.\n\n20 For LNG bunkering, see SGMF – Recommendations for linked emergency shutdown (ESD) arrangements for LNG bunkering (Reference 7)\n\n21 IMO – International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (Reference 1)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Ship Shore Link\n\n\nAlthough ESD pendants provide some additional measure of safety for LPG transfers, it is recommended that\nlinked systems are fitted and used as they provide faster response times and avoid the need for personnel to\napproach the cargo transfer area.\n\nThe ESD system may be activated by personnel in response to an emergency situation on their asset or to\nan emergency situation nearby that directly affects their asset. Personnel should be trained and given clear\ninstructions on when they can activate ESD if the emergency situation is not on their asset.\n\n###### 6.3 Compatibility\n\nIt is recommended that the ship owner fits the appropriate systems for the ship’s trading pattern. See Annex 2\nfor a brief overview of the types of link system that are typically used in the industry.\n\nTable 4 provides guidance on the types of ESD link suggested for LNG and LPG carriers. These may not be\nsuitable in every case and the owner will need to ensure that they choose the best ESD link for their particular\nship. Some terminals use backup SSL systems, such as pneumatic links, which are not covered in this table.\n\n**Type of ESD link** **Typically used for LNG** **Typically used for LPG**\n\nFibre optic 6 pin  \nElectric 37 pin  \nElectric 6 pin  \n\nElectric 5 pin  \n\n**Table 4: Suggested ESD links for LNG and LPG carriers**\n\nFor example, an LPG carrier that is trading worldwide may find maximum benefit from fitting both Electric 6 pin\nand Electric 5 pin. The use of an ESD pendant is no longer recommended.\n\nTerminals may fit the systems that are suitable for the types of ships that call at their facility. It is recommended\nthat terminals fit suitable links to ensure that all ships are able to connect to the terminal system. For example, as\na minimum, LPG terminals may fit Electric 5 pin or Electric 6 pin, or both.\n\n###### 6.4 Ship Shore Link Testing\n\nThe SSL should be inspected and tested as part of the pre-arrival test and after manifold connection as part of\nthe pre-transfer test.\n\nFor the pre-transfer test, the SSL is tested after connection to check that the link is communicating properly. ESD\nshould be activated once from the ship and once from the terminal, to check that the signal is transmitted in\nboth directions.\n\nDuring one of the tests, the manifold valve can be left open to check that it closes within 25 to 30 seconds.\n\nIt is considered more efficient and acceptable to carry out most of the testing of push-buttons, high-level alarms\nand other ESD triggers during pre-arrival testing. It is considered preferable for pre-transfer testing to be limited\nto SSL testing and the manifold ESD valve timing check.\n\n|Type of ESD link|Typically used for LNG|Typically used for LPG|\n|---|---|---|\n|Fibre optic 6 pin||-|\n|Electric 37 pin||-|\n|Electric 6 pin|||\n|Electric 5 pin|||\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Ship Shore Link\n\n\nThe SSL test should be carried out before any cargo transfer or cooldown operations begin.\n\nThere is no need to carry out another ESD test in the cold condition. This historic practice started as a result\nof a certain valve design that could get stuck once it was cooled down. For modern valves, this issue has not\nbeen observed.\n\nIf considered necessary for the manifold valves, an operation check can be carried out after cooldown to\nensure that they are moving properly. This cold valve test should not interfere with any jetty boil-off recovery\noperations, so where such systems are in operation, the vapour valve operation check may be omitted.\n\nThe system may be designed with the option to test the ESD link without tripping the GBSS. If so, it may be safer\nto provide the inhibit function with a timer that automatically resets after a suitable period.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## 7\n\n Emergency Release Systems\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### Emergency Release Systems\n\n\n#### 7. Emergency Release Systems\n\nThe function of an emergency release system (ERS) is to protect the cargo transfer system and marine loading\narm (MLA) and minimise spillage of liquefied gas through quick disconnection if a ship drifts out of its operating\nenvelope. The ERS is not part of the ESD system, but because it interfaces with the terminal and ship ESD\nsystems, it is discussed in this chapter. This document does not provide recommendations for the ERS other than\nvalve closure timing.\n\nFigure 14 shows an operating envelope, shutdown envelope and disconnection envelope of an MLA.\n\n**Figure 14: MLA safety envelope**\n\n###### 7.1 Design and Construction Standards\n\nMLAs are typically designed, constructed and tested using the following two key publications:\n\n1. _Design and Construction Specification for Marine Loading Arms (Reference 8)._\n\n2. _ISO 16904 – Design and testing of LNG marine transfer arms for conventional onshore terminals_\n\n(Reference 9).\n\nTo better understand the discussion in this document, it is recommended that the above publications are read.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Emergency Release Systems\n\n\n###### 7.2 Explanation of ERS and ESD Interface\n\nThe ERS is typically used for liquefied gas duties, but not all MLAs come fitted with one. This discussion is not\nrelevant to MLAs that do not have an ERS fitted.\n\nThe layers of protection and the possible degradation factors can be seen in the highly simplified bowties in\nFigures 15 to 17. The example selected is a threat from adverse weather and the consequence is structural\ndamage to the loading arm.\n\nNatural\nenvironment/\nweather conditions\n\nAdverse weather\n(wind and sea state)\n\nStructural damage\nto loading arm\n\nMooring equipment\nfailure Loss of position\n\nStructural damage\nto jetty\n\nPassing ship surge\neffect\n\n**Figure 15: Simplified bowtie for loss of position**\n\nNatural\nenvironment/\nweather conditions\n\nAdverse weather Loss of position\n(wind and sea state)\n\nProtective location of Terminal operating Monitor weather\nterminal jetty weather limits forecasts\n\n**Figure 16: Simplified bowtie showing adverse weather threat**\n\n\nLoss of position\n\n\nAdverse weather\n(wind and sea state)\n\n\nPassing ship surge\neffect\n\n\nStructural damage\nto jetty\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Emergency Release Systems\n\n\nThe ERS will trigger an emergency shutdown when the MLA moves into the shutdown area. This causes the\nfollowing to happen without delay:\n\n1. ERS sends a signal to terminal ESD system.\n\n2. Terminal ESD system is activated.\n\n3. Terminal sends signal to ship (via ESD link).\n\n4. Ship ESD system activates.\n\n|Col1|Structural damage to loading arm|\n|---|---|\n\n\nLoss of\nposition\n\n\nStructural\ndamage\nto loading arm\n\n\nESD stops\ntransfer on ship\nand terminal\n(18.10.1.4)\n\n\nERS valve\ntiming not less\nthan 5 seconds\n\n\nESD valves\ndesigned to limit\nsurge (5.5.1.2/\n18.10.1.1)\n\n|Col1|Process piping damage due to surge effect|\n|---|---|\n\n\nProcess piping\ndamage due to\nsurge effect\n\n\n**Figure 17: Simplified bowtie showing structural damage to loading arm consequence[22]**\n\nWhen the MLA moves into the disconnection area, the ERS will trigger an emergency release signal. This will\ncause the following to happen:\n\n1. ERS sends a signal to terminal ESD system.\n\n2. Terminal ESD system is activated.\n\n3. Terminal sends signal to ship (via ESD link).\n\n4. Ship ESD system activates.\n\n5. ERS valves close (eg within 5 to 10 seconds).\n\n6. Emergency release coupler (ERC) releases within 2 seconds.\n\n7. MLA retracts under power.\n\nThe time allocated for ERS valves to close is dependent on the terminal design and is not necessarily fixed\nat 5 to 10 seconds. For receiving terminals, setting a value for ERS valves below 5 seconds may cause\nunacceptable pressure surge on a discharging ship. For this reason, it is not recommended to set the ERS valves\nto close faster than 5 seconds.\n\n22 IMO – International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (Reference 1) – references in bowtie\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Annexes\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\n#### Annex 1 – IGC Code References\n\nThis section provides a summary of ESD and related references in the IGC Code (2016 Edition)[23].\n\nESD systems on liquefied gas carriers should be designed to meet the requirements of the IGC Code found in\nChapters 5 and 18.

The new modems need to be compatible with the\nexisting old ones\n\n� public and plant telephones are analogue telephone exchange lines connected at the shore side, with\nanalogue telephone handsets connected on board the ship\n\n� _hotphone refers to a DC signalling phone system compatible with the original Iwatsu TS3 standard_\n\n� a digital ship shore link (SSL) via SONET initially allows for a direct repeat of the functionality as\ninterfaced over the original four cores. In enhanced installations, such as floating storage and\nregasification units (FSRUs), compressed natural gas (CNG) ESD, additional telephony and process data\ncan be transferred via these cores\n\n|Core|Direction|Analogue configuration|Digital configuration|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Ship to shore|4-Channel multiplex data|-|\n|2|Shore to ship||-|\n|3|Ship to shore|LNG ESD (5kHz Trip,10kHz Healthy+/-10%)|-|\n|4|Shore to ship||-|\n|5|Ship to shore|-|Digital signal|\n|6|Shore to ship|-|Digital signal|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\n� when carrying out ship to ship (STS) operations, a cross-over umbilical cable will be required to cross the\ntransmit and receive cores. Without other major configuration changes, in STS mode, only ESD signals\nwill work\n\n� for FSRU operations, the connections are configured similarly to a terminal and all channels typically work.\n\n###### 37 Pin Electric\n\nThis type of connector, shown in Figure A2, is commonly used in LNG applications.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n37\n3\n\n**Figure A2: 37 pin electric connector**\n\nThe model in use in SSLs has 37 electrical contacts, of which 36 are usually electrically connected via an\numbilical cable.\n\nThe convention used is that any LNG transfer practice should follow the standard pinout configuration. In the\ncase of a floating storage unit (FSU) or a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), all the liquid transfer\nshutdown signals will be via the pairs 13/14 and 15/16.\n\nAny additional signals required by the application, such as CNG ESD in an FSRU, should use the alternate ESD\npins, as used in the majority of FSRU installations to date.\n\nDetails to note for this connector are:\n\n� Flameproof connectors are the main hazardous area protection\n\n� public and plant telephones are analogue telephone exchange lines connected at the shore side and\nanalogue telephone handsets are connected on board the ship\n\n� _hotphone refers to a DC signaling phone system compatible with the original Iwatsu TS3 standard. In_\nsome cases, a lift to ring phone may be used in electric mode. When the handset is lifted in this mode,\nthe counterpart phone rings automatically, via a lift to ring exchange generator installed on the shore.\nAlthough hotphone mode is considered the primary mode, the mode of operation should be confirmed\n\n� a continuity link is a feature used as a ‘connected’ confirmation signal to allow voltage to be applied to\nshore supplied telephony signals. In case an umbilical cable breaks, the continuity function will detect the\nloss of signal and isolate the telephone voltages at the source. Two pairs are defined, but only one pair is\nrequired to be in place. This is a legacy of older systems\n\n� mooring line monitoring (MLM) data should be compatible with the legacy MTL3058 signal converter\nprotocols to maintain compatibility\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n37\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\n� when carrying out STS operations, one ship will have to reconfigure itself to a pseudo shore system\nand reverse the ESD pin pairs, without other major configuration changes. In STS mode, only ESD and\nhotphone signals will work\n\n� to assist with connector mating, it is important to identify the larger internal key profile to allow alignment\nwith the counterpart.\n\nTable A2 shows the pin configurations for a 37 pin electric connector.\n\n|Col1|LNG Carrier|Col3|FSRU|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Pin|Function|Alternate function/notes|Function|Alternate function/notes|\n|1|NOT USED|Legacy signal|NOT USED|-|\n|2|||-|-|\n|3|NOT USED|Legacy signal|NOT USED|-|\n|4|||-|-|\n|5|Hotphone|Legacy signal/can be used in DC signal hotphone mode or lift to ring (private line) mode|Hotphone|DC signal hotphone mode only|\n|6|||-|-|\n|7|Public phone|Telephone handset is fitted on the LNG carrier (LNGC)|Public phone|-|\n|8|||-|-|\n|9|Plant phone|Telephone handset is fitted on the LNGC|Plant phone|-|\n|10|||-|-|\n|11|NOT USED|Legacy signal|NOT USED|-|\n|12|||-|-|\n|13|Shore to ship ESD|Volt-free contact on shore – closed when healthy|Shore to ship ESD (LNG)|Or FSRU to LNGC ESD (LNG)|\n|14|||-|-|\n|15|Ship to shore ESD|Volt-free contact on ship – closed when healthy|Ship to shore ESD (LNG)|Or LNGC to FSRU ESD (LNG)|\n|16|||-|-|\n|17|Continuity link|Hard wired volt-free contact on ship – closed when healthy|Continuity link|-|\n|18|||-|-|\n|19|Continuity link|Hard wired volt-free contact on ship – closed when healthy|Continuity link|-|\n|20|||-|-|\n|21|NOT USED|Legacy signal|NOT USED|-|\n|22|||-|-|\n|23|NOT USED|Legacy signal|NOT USED|-|\n|24|||-|-|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n|25|NOT USED|Legacy signal|Shore to FSRU ESD (CNG)|-|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|26|||-|-|\n|27|NOT USED|Legacy signal|FSRU to shore ESD (CNG)|-|\n|28|||-|-|\n|29|Shore test voltage|29 = +24vDC 30 = 0V|Shore test voltage|29 = +24vDC 30 = 0V|\n|30|||-|-|\n|31|MLM|31 = 0V common reference 32 = R\u0007eceive on ship (transmit from shore) 33 = T\u0007ransmit from ship (receive on shore)|MLM|31 = 0V common reference 32 = R\u0007eceive on ship (transmit from shore) 33 = T\u0007ransmit from ship (receive on shore)|\n|32|||-|-|\n|33|||-|-|\n|34|NOT USED|-|NOT USED|-|\n|35|Ship test voltage|35 = 0V 36 = +24VDC|Ship test voltage|35 = 0V 36 = +24VDC|\n|36|||-|-|\n|37|NOT USED|-|NOT USED|-|\n\n\n**Table A2: Pin configurations for a 37 pin electric connector**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\n###### 6 Pin Electric\n\nThis type of connector, shown in Figure A3, is used in LPG and LNG applications.\n\nThe model in use in SSLs has six electrical contacts with two connectors used, of which all six cores are usually\nelectrically connected via an umbilical cable.\n\n**Figure A3: 6 pin electric connector**\n\nDetails to note:\n\n� Flameproof connectors are the main hazardous area protection\n\n� the connectors’ original design purpose was for internal use in non-LNG markets, so they require\nprotection from the environment when deck-mounted\n\n� public and plant telephones are analogue telephone exchange lines connected at the shore side and\nanalogue telephone handsets are connected on board the ship\n\n� _hotphone refers to a DC signalling phone system compatible with the original Iwatsu TS3 standard.

The fibre optic system uses a four-channel multiplexer for telephones and\nfor exchange of mooring tension data. As intrinsically-safe multiplexers with up to 64 channels are already in\nuse in the gas industry, the potential exists to expand the use of the 5 pin link for telephony and data transfer,\nvia an agreed protocol.\n\n|1|+|Intrinsically safe circuit, nominal 24v DC, 20mA|\n|---|---|---|\n|2|–|Intrinsically safe circuit, nominal 24v DC, 20mA|\n|3|+|Spare|\n|N|–|Spare|\n|E||Not connected|\n\n\nN 3\n\n1 2\n\n\n3 N\n\n2 1\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\nFree\nmovement of\nmating part\n\nNote:\nThe retaining\nring and locknut\nare not part\nof the interface\nspecification.\n\n\nø33.0\n\nø38.0\n\nø32.0\n\nø32.0\n\n\n2.70\n\n2.70\n\n2.70\n\n90.0°\n\n45.0°\n\n150.0°\n\n\n4.90\n2.70\n\n2.70\n\n2.70\n\n104.0°\n\n52.0° 137.0°\n\n\n5 off male solid\n2.4 mm O/D PIN\non 11.1 mm PCD\n\n2 start acme-2g style thread\nmajor DIA-1½”, pitch ½”\n\nNote-IP sealing arrangement\nshow for example\nO-ring sealing\n\n5 off female\n2.45 mm I/D\nsocket with\nsplit spring\ncontact\n\n\n15.0 3.5\n2.8\n\n\n5.25\n2.90\n\n2.90\n\n2.90\n\n104.0°\n\n52.0° 45.0°\n\n137.0°\n\nø21.5\n\nø20.0\n\nø23.3\n\n\nMinimum IP rating: IP67\nOperable temperature range: 40° C < Ta < +60° C\n\n\n2.90\n\n2.90\n\n90.0°\n\n150.0°\n\n|Dimension Tolerances|Col2|Col3|5-way connector pin designations|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Linear|0.00 +0.0|5 –0.05|1|+|Intrinsically safe circuit, nominal 24v dc, up to 20mA Healthy, <4mA ESD|\n|Linear|0.0 +0.1|–0.1|2|–|Intrinsically safe circuit, nominal 24v dc, up to 20mA Healthy, <4mA ESD|\n|Angular|0.0 +0.1°|–0.1°|3|+|Spare (used for pendant system when switched on)|\n|Angular|0 +1°|–1°|N|–|Spare (used for pendant system when switched on)|\n|All other tolerances as drawing|||E||Not connected|\n|Dimensio|n unit mm|||||\n\n\n**Figure A5: Example of recommended 5 pin twist connector interface arrangement: male and female connectors**\n\nMale Contact Pin\n\n\nTypical pin and socket arrangement shown –\nalternate designs must be compatible\n\nPin and Socket\nDescription-Connector Pin and Socket\nMaterial-Copper (KS D 5101) Gold Plated\n\nSpring\nDescription-Pin Retaining Spring\n\n\n4.80 [0.00]\n-0.05\n\n2.50 ± 0.01\n\n\nø3.4\n\nR1.0\n\nFemale Contact Pin\n\n6.0\n\n17.0\n\n4.7\n\n1.2\n4.5\n\n\nø3.3\n\nø3.6\n\n\nø2.40 ± 0.01\n\n18.9\n\nSpring Pin Retainer\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n0.80 ± 0.01\n\n|± 0.01|17.0 4.7|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n||||\n||6.4||\n\n\n1.4\n\n|Tolerance|Dim ± 0.1|ension Units|mm|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n**Figure A6: Example of recommended 5 pin twist connector interface arrangement: male and female contact details**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\n###### Pneumatic Connections\n\nThe earliest SSLs used in LNG projects were simple pneumatic umbilical links, comprised of an air hose coupled\ndirectly into the ship’s air security system. Such systems are inherently slow in operation and suffer from\nproblems caused by dirt or moisture. It is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve accurate and repeatable timing.\n\nThese drawbacks have led to the development of electronic ESD systems with fibre optic or various intrinsicallysafe electric systems providing the SSL.\n\nIn the majority of terminals, pneumatic links are now only provided as a backup in the event of failure of the\nmain optical fibre or electrical link. A typical system is shown in Figure A7.\n\nPressure\nswitch\n\nAir regulator Solenoid operated\nNeedle\n\ndump valve\n\nvalve\n\nHose\ncoupling\n\n\nPressure\n\ngauge\n\n\nTest valve\n\n\n**Figure A7: Typical pneumatic link**\n\nAt least two types of connector are in use, but the most common is the standard ½” MIL-C-51234 quick\nconnector. The connector type can vary, so this should be clarified during the compatibility review.\n\n###### Cyber Security\n\nOrganisations should review their ESD systems to check for cyber security risks. Information on the hardware\narchitecture should be passed on to cyber security experts. Even if the ship sends data from their side, the risk is\nmitigated if the information terminates in an analogue box.\n\nThis section aims to provide cyber security specialists with relevant information. It will summarise the type of\ninformation that may be sent over typical ESD links into analogue and digital signals. As digital signals are\ntypically the area of concern for cyber security, more detail is provided on these types of transmission.\n\n**Fibre optic 6 pin**\n\nThere are two types of configurations typically found for this 6-core fibre optic connector. One configuration\nuses cores 1 to 4 and the other uses cores 5 to 6.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\n**Cores 1 to 4**\n\n\u0007This configuration uses two fibre optic cores for ESD transmission and two fibre optic cores for\ntelecommunication transmission.\n\n\u0007The two cores that are used for ESD transmission carry an analogue signal between the ship\nand terminal.\n\nThe two cores that are used for telecommunications are further split into four channels:\n\n� Channel 1 is used for digital signals using a modem (mooring tension data). These modems are\ntypically hardwired at both the ship and terminal interfaces\n\n� Channels 2 to 4 are used for analogue signals (telephone).\n\n**Cores 5 to 6**\n\nThis configuration uses two fibre optic cores for digital transmission. This configuration can be used for:\n\n� ESD signal\n\n� telephone signal\n\n� ethernet link.\n\n**Electric 37 pin**\n\nThere are two possible data channels available via this link and both are very similar to the fibre options.\nThe MLM data can be sent between shore and ship and serial data is the interface. The SSL includes data\nconverters to make the data compatible to the format used in the now obsolete MLT3058 serial repeaters. Due\nto a change in hazardous area certification for Ex’i’ around 2003, the MTL barrier parts cannot be sourced\ndirectly. However as the Pyle protection is Ex’d’, non-certified alternate converters can be used. There exists the\nsame limited potential for malicious interference.\n\nFor FSRU or FSU type systems where a data link to shore is required, ethernet extenders have been utilised.\nThese operate in pairs and are similar to modems. They allow an ethernet connection between ship and shore\nand the same hazards as the fibre digital data channel exist. Note that the bandwidth is limited by the quality of\nthe cables and connections.\n\n**Electric 6 pin**\n\nThis type of connector is configured to use four pins for analogue ESD signals. Sometimes one of the spare pins\nis connected to ground.\n\nThis connector is not typically configured to carry digital signals.\n\n**Electric 5 Pin**\n\nThis type of connector is configured to use two pins for analogue ESD signals. Two other pins may be used\nfor testing.\n\nThis connector is not typically configured to carry digital signals.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\n#### Annex 3 – Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations\n\n**CCR Cargo Control Room**\n\n**CNG Compressed Natural Gas**\n\n**ERC** Emergency Release Coupler\n\n**ERS Emergency Release System**\n\n**ESD Emergency Shutdown**\n\n**FSRU Floating Storage and Regasification Unit**\n\n**FSU Floating Storage Unit**\n\n**GBSS Gas Burning Safety System**\n\n**HAZOP Hazard and Operability Study**\n\n**IEC International Electrotechnical Commission**\n\n**IMO International Maritime Organization**\n\n**ISO International Organization for Standardization**\n\n**LNGC Liquefied Natural Gas Carrier**\n\n**LOPA Layer of Protection Analysis**\n\n**MARV Maximum Allowable Relief Valve Setting**\n\n**MGV Master Gas Valve**\n\n**MLA Marine Loading Arm**\n\n**OCIMF Oil Companies International Marine Forum**\n\n**OTS Off the Shelf**\n\n**PLC Programmable Logic Controller**\n\n**SSL Ship Shore Link**\n\n**STS Ship to Ship**\n\n**Terminal Refers to all receiving and exporting facilities, including floating and regasification facilities**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Annexes\n\n\n#### Annex 4 – Reference List\n\n1.
