The company is still not taking ownership of the breach,**\n**caused by a third-party application exploit! So what really went down in 2018 and who is**\n**responsible? Let’s break it down.**\n\nAlthough Ticketmaster UK is not an eCommerce entity, online transactions are happening\neverywhere and opening up millions of attack options for hackers. This development has\ncome at a very crucial time, as hundreds of millions of people are expected to shop online\nahead of the upcoming holiday season.\n\n### ICO: “Ticketmaster Failed to Implement a Layered Security Approach”\n\nInbenta Technologies is a leading figure in this story. As mentioned earlier, Ticketmaster UK\nimplemented Inbenta’s chat-bot code in its ecosystem.\n\nSince the attacks began in February of 2018 and continued till June 2018, when the rouge\nInbenta plugin was finally removed, the case was unclear and so were the financial and legal\nimplications. But as we all know now, it has been decided by the ICO to issue the fine in\ncompliance with the new 2018 GDPR rules.\n\n**_Ticketmaster was found to have directly violated the Article 5(1)(f) and 32_**\n**_requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_**\n\nICO representatives state that Ticketmaster UK should have done more to protect its users\nand that it single-handedly put millions of people at risk as it failed to adopt a layered\napproach to security, which included the failure to meet the exact PCI-DSS requirements at\nthat time.\n\nSource: [ICO Blog](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2020/11/ico-fines-ticketmaster-uk-limited-125million-for-failing-to-protect-customers-payment-details/)\n\nIn the meanwhile, Ticketmaster is claiming that Inbenta Technologies software compromised\nits security measures and plans to appeal against the fine. Inbenta, the vendor that provided\nTicketmaster with the chat-bot plugin, said that Ticketmaster misused the code which led to\nexposure risk in the first place.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith both sides looking at a long legal tussle, who is really responsible for the data breach?\nIs Ticketmaster right in appealing the latest ICO ruling?\n\nNevertheless, it’s clear now that the regulators refer to Ticketmaster as fully accountable for\nthe 2018 incident. No matter how you look at it, it is also clear that any online business,\nregardless of the sector, must do everything it can to monitor its third-party apps and avoid\nsecurity risks.\n\n### The Third-Party Inbenta Chat-Bot Plugin That Went Rogue\n\nEven though the third-party provider Inbenta accepts that its JavaScript code caused the\nproblem in the Ticketmaster online payment system, it claims that the ticketing company\nshould not have added the code directly to the pages. In other words, Inbenta is pleading\ninnocent in the aforementioned case.\n\nBeing placed on the checkout pages without any security measure (as claimed by the thirdparty vendor Ibenta Technologies), the code had access to sensitive customer information.\nThis was targeted by attackers, who successfully modified the script, executed the breach,\nand harvested the data.\n\nFortunately enough, the code was specifically customized to meet Ticketmaster’s\nrequirements, therefore no other platforms were compromised.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there was a debate around the fact that the script was stored on\nInbenta servers, arguably making it responsible for the breach.\n\n**But the ICO put a stop to the speculations by determining that Ticketmaster is to**\n**blame, regardless of the direct involvement of Inbenta Technologies.**\n\n**_“The GDPR does not prevent an organisation from implementing third-party_**\n**_scripts. Rather, the GDPR requires that each organisation assess the risks_**\n**_arising in the circumstances of their own implementation and put controls in_**\n**_place to protect the personal data that it processes”_**\n\n_[Source: ICO, Information Commissioner’s Office, PENALTY NOTICE; Section 6.26,](https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/2618609/ticketmaster-uk-limited-mpn.pdf)_\n_The ICO Ticketmaster UK Ruling._\n\nTicketmaster was not the only company to be attacked in 2018. Magecart has been targeting\nthird-party software components in order to obtain access to sensitive information for years.\nMagecart attacks third-party platforms and replaces their code with their own malicious\nscripts to harvest personal data.\n\nBritish Airways is another major Magecart victim. As per the ICO, which issued a $230\nmillion fine on the aviation giant, over 500000 customers’ details were exposed due to a\nGDPR breach. The fine was reduced to $20 million in October 2020. In that case the third\n\n-----\n\nparty app involved was a user-experience solution called Modernizr, which was manipulated\nto gain unauthorized access to the data.\n\n### GDPR: Why is Ticketmaster Accountable for the Third-Party Breach?\n\nThere have been many discussions about who is responsible and why Ticketmaster was\nfined instead of Inbenta, the third-party vendor? But first things first, what is GDPR? It’s\nbasically an EU regulation that coordinates data privacy and protection laws within the\nEuropean Union, but also affects companies doing business in Europe.\n\nHow does GDPR describe the data protection process and find the accountable party? It\nmakes a distinction between data controllers and data processors.\n\n**Data Controllers – Controllers are businesses or individuals that make decisions about data**\nprocessing, which essentially makes them in charge of these activities. Although entire\ncompanies can be seen as controllers, in reality, only the decision-makers will be subject to\nGDPR regulations.\n\n**Data Processors – Unlike controllers, processors do not make decisions about processing**\nactivities and act solely on behalf of controllers. Serving controllers’ interests, processors\nonly process the relevant information as instructed and required by controllers, including\nsome daily operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf processors act on their own without the controllers consent or permission, they will be\nseen as controllers and bear full responsibility for the consequences. Processors can also be\nboth organizations and individuals. Employees of the controller are neither controllers or\nprocessors.\n\n### The Bottom Line: Companies must implement appropriate security controls to avoid risks created by their third-party application.\n\nThe fact is that Inbenta didn’t make any controlling or processing decisions without\nTicketmaster’s permission, nor did it influence any activities.\n\nHence, the third-party chat-bot vendor is not legally responsible for the 2018 Ticketmaster\ndata breach. Ticketmaster misused its piece of code and thus is fully accountable for the\nconsequences. It failed to correctly use the code and detect the data breach source, while\nneglecting warning signs from banks.\n\nIn this case, Ticketmaster will probably be paying the full sum of the penalty that has been\ndecided upon by the Information Commissioner’s Office.\n\neCommerce websites, online retailers, and online services providers like Ticketmaster UK,\nnow have to take full responsibility for their eco-systems. More emphasis must be placed on\nthird-party applications. In practice, companies are now required to start monitoring their\nbehavior and not just depend on traditional solutions that are becoming increasingly\nineffective.\n\nThe growing blind-spot of third-party app security is proving to be very costly. Remember, it\nmay be a third-party code, but security – is now your responsibility.\n\nAdditional reading and sources:\n\n**_ICO, Information Commissioner’s Office, PENALTY NOTICE (re Ticketmaster UK).
