So-called\n\"Advanced Persistent Threat\" (APT) attacks are common news as individuals and\ncorporations discover the data on their hard drives is part of a country or competitor's\n\"shopping list.\" The actors behind these attacks are generally well-equipped in terms of\ntraining, finances, and access to resources. The missions of APT threat actors are usually of\nstrategic importance, and the actors exercise virtually unlimited patience in penetrating and\npersisting inside their specific target's network until they accomplish their goals.\n\nOne of the universal aspects of APT attacks is the use of malicious software tools that grant\nunauthorized backdoor access to computer systems inside the targeted network. Because\nmaintaining a beachhead inside the network is often critical to mission success, threat actors\nmust adapt to various network configurations and changes in defenses by choosing and\ndeploying backdoors with specific functionality and features. It is difficult to be persistent\nwithout at least one backdoor. Threat actors often possess and use an arsenal of remote\naccess trojans (RATs) to siphon data from their targets. Persistence requires malware, and\nthe top cyber-espionage actors have hundreds of RATs at their disposal at any given time.\nUnderstanding the choice and usage of tools can be the keys to identifying and tracking\nAPTs.\n\nDell SecureWorks researchers have identified and classified more than 200 distinct malware\nfamilies used by various APT groups. Some malware is specially configured off-the-shelf\nsoftware, and some malware is customized source code of an existing RAT. However, most\nmalware families are proprietary, developed by the APT groups as weapons to be deployed\nagainst a variety of targets. Accurate identification and classification of this malware by\nantivirus (AV) companies is sparse. Shared code, the use of common tools, co-infections,\nand a history of generic or incorrect classification by multiple names make the automated\ntracking of these tools by AV companies difficult. This inaccuracy can be detrimental when\ndesigning defenses based on specific threat indicators. Tracking APTs requires a dedicated\n\n\n-----\n\nmalware intelligence effort. One way applied malware intelligence is used to discover new\nAPT trojans is a recursive investigative method: Malware -> Infrastructure Touchpoints ->\nNew Malware -> and so on.\n\nCyber-espionage actors often cycle through different RATs over a period of years. The Dell\nSecureWorks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) research team has tracked a RAT known as\n\"Comfoo\" that has been in continuous development since at least 2006. This RAT has\nmaintained a fairly low profile, even though it was used as part of the RSA breach in 2010,\nwhen its code was first analyzed. Antivirus firm Trend Micro briefly mentioned its use in a\n2012 paper titled \"Luckycat Redux — Inside an APT Campaign with Multiple Targets in India\nand Japan.\" However, the disclosure of this trojan and some of its command and control (C2)\ninfrastructure did not discourage its continued use by the threat actors responsible for it.\n\n**Comfoo characteristics**\n\nTo maintain persistence on the system, Comfoo usually replaces the path to the DLL of an\nexisting unused service rather than installing a new service. A new service is more likely to\nbe noticed by system audits. Sometimes Comfoo is delivered with a rootkit that hides\nComfoo's files on disk. Additionally, Comfoo starts the existing \"ipnat\" system service. This\naction causes remote inbound connections to the infected system to fail, blocking remote\nmaintenance by the network administrator.\n\n**_Network behavior_**\n\nComfoo's network traffic is encrypted and encapsulated in HTTP requests and responses,\nalthough some variants skip the encapsulation step. Payloads are encrypted by a 10-byte\nstatic XOR key that is hard-coded inside the Comfoo binary. Initial login data from the\ninfected system (MAC address, internal IP address, campaign tag, and version data) is\npassed in the request URI and is additionally encrypted by a dynamic key, as shown in\nFigure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Comfoo URL decryption algorithm example. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n**_Capabilities_**\n\nThe Comfoo RAT has the following features:\n\nSystem/network information gathering\nKeystroke logging\nScreenshots\nFile upload/download/execute\nCommand shell\n\n**Comfoo trojan C2 software discovery**\n\nBy studying the network traffic of infected systems, CTU researchers determined that the\nserver side of the Comfoo malware sends an HTTP server header identifying the server\nversion as \"Apache 2.0.50 (Unix)\". However, the rest of the HTTP headers do not match the\norder or the formatting used by this version of Apache. This anomaly suggests that the C2\nsoftware was a standalone application instead of a series of scripts running under Apache.\nSearching for the specific server version string in the CTU malware repository produced a\nsample of the Comfoo server software, identified by the MD5 hash\n2b29f0224b632fdd00d0a30527b795b7.\n\n**_Analysis_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Comfoo C2 server turns out to be a rendezvous-type traffic relay program. This small\nbinary can be deployed on rented or hacked Windows systems, where it passes traffic\nbetween Comfoo victims and the Comfoo master console operated by the threat actors (see\nFigure 2).\n\n_Figure 2. Organization of rendezvous-type traffic relay program. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nUnlike \"dumb\" traffic relay servers such as HTran, the Comfoo relay server does not know\nthe location of the master console. Instead, the master console program connects to the\nrelay server on-demand, and any incoming victim data is passed to the master console\nconnection. HTran is sometimes used to add an additional layer of untraceability to the victim\nconnection. Likewise, the administrator can add other layers of proxies or VPN connections\nto the console connection side of the communication.\n\nThe Comfoo relay server listens on up to three TCP ports at a time. The first port acts as a\ncontrol and typically listens on port 1688. It performs the following tasks:\n\nEnables/disables the other ports\nAccepts new relay port configuration (stored in rlycfg.dll)\nNotifies master console that a new victim connection is available\n\nThe second port is the admin relay port, which typically listens on port 1689. It accepts\nconnections from the master console to send commands to and receive data from victims'\nsystems. The third port is the victim relay port, which listens on a configurable port number,\nusually port 80 or port 443. This port accepts connections from victims' systems to send data\nto and receive commands from the Comfoo administrator encapsulated in HTTP requests\nand responses. If there is no current connection between the victim and the Comfoo\nadministrator, Comfoo logs the victim's connection and sends an idle response to the victim.\n\n**_DNS resolution tactics_**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to using rendezvous protocols and HTran forwarding servers, Comfoo operators\ncreate and maintain another layer of obfuscation to thwart analysis of their infrastructure.\nLike many other APT malware families, Comfoo reaches out to its masters based on DNS\nlookups of certain hostnames. The Comfoo operators commonly use dynamic DNS providers\nto micromanage the IP addresses to which Comfoo hostnames resolve. While Comfoo\nsleeps, its operators often set those IP addresses to common or bogus entries. When not\nbeing used to actively control Comfoo, the C2 domain name might resolve to the address of\n[a popular search engine or a local loopback (127.0.0.1),](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735) [private (10.1.1.1), or other special](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)\nuse (0.0.0.0) IP address. Domain names used in Comfoo operations only point to actual\ncontrol infrastructure during very short time windows. Only during these time windows do\nalerts from a DNS monitoring tool inform researchers when it might be possible to locate an\nactual Comfoo server. Figure 3 maps IP addresses used in Comfoo campaigns.\n\n_Figure 3. Geolocation plot of all public routable IP addresses resolved from a set of Comfoo_\n_C2 hostnames, including bogus distractors. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe map in Figure 4 shows only the IP addresses that actually speak Comfoo's protocol,\nillustrating how DNS tactics such as the distractor IP addresses can mask actual control\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Geolocation plot of actual IP addresses used for Comfoo C2 servers. (Source: Dell_\n_SecureWorks)_\n\n**_Taking control_**\n\nThe unauthenticated nature of the Comfoo relay server's administrative connections makes it\npossible to take control of the C2 server and all victims' systems, armed only with knowledge\nof the protocol, the encryption method, and the static encryption key hard-coded into every\nComfoo binary. Researchers can passively monitor victims' logins to the relay servers\n(sending no commands) by connecting to the correct port on the correct IP address at the\nright time. This technique is analogous to viewing webserver log data stored in a publicly\naccessible directory on a C2 server.\n\nTo help identify and notify victims of Comfoo-based espionage, CTU researchers set up a\npassive monitoring system for dozens of active Comfoo C2 relays and have been running\nthis system since January 2012. Connections from the monitoring system are periodic, so\nnot all victim logins are observed. Only the initial connection data is logged, and it is not\npossible to see data being exfiltrated from victims' networks using this method.\n\n**_Passive monitoring results_**\n\nWhile monitoring Comfoo, CTU researchers detected more than 200 variants of the trojan\nand 64 different campaign tags used by the threat actors to organize their campaigns.\nNumerous government entities and private companies based in the United States, Europe,\nand Asia Pacific had Comfoo-infected computers phoning home to the Comfoo C2\ninfrastructure (see Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Geographic location of Comfoo victim organizations. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nMuch of the traffic emanated from multiple Japanese and Indian government ministries. CTU\nresearchers outlined the Japanese attack campaign in a previous analysis entitled Chasing\nAPT. The following industries were also targeted:\n\nEducation\nEnergy\nMineral exploration\nNews media\nSemiconductors\nSteel manufacturing\nThink tanks\nTelecommunications\nTrade organizations\nAudio and videoconferencing products\n\nThe targeting of audio and videoconferencing products is unusual. CTU researchers\nspeculate that the threat actors might be looking for intellectual property relating to audio and\nvideoconferencing. Another possibility is that it could be a clever and stealthy way of listening\nand watching activities of both commercial and government organizations.\n\n**Detecting Comfoo in the enterprise**\n\nThe presence of Comfoo on a network or computer can be detected in a variety of ways,\neven if AV engines lack detection for the latest variants. Analysts can search for known\nComfoo threat indicators in network traffic, on hard drives, in memory, or in the Windows\nregistry.\n\n**_Network detection_**\n\nA typical Comfoo HTTP phone-home request looks like the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nGET /CWoNaJLBo/VTNeWw11212/12664/12VTNfNmM1aQ/UTWOqVQ132/ HTTP/1.1Accept: image/gif,\nimage/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*Accept-Language: en-enUser-Agent:\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0;Windows NT 5.1)Host:\nsmtp.dynamiclink.ddns.usConnection: Keep-AliveCache-Control: no-cache\n\n```\nAn active C2 server responds with headers similar to the following:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Mon, 29 Jul 2013 19:26:15 GMTServer: Apache/2.0.50\n(Unix)Content-Length: 10Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=90\n\n```\n**_Disk/memory/registry detection_**\n\nThe unique string T1Y943jIhk can be found in the Comfoo binary. Offline forensic analysis\nmay be required to search for this string if a rootkit is in play.\n\nThese additional strings can be searched but are not guaranteed to be unique to Comfoo:\n\nCPUSpeed:%d.%dGHz\nCPUNameString:%s\nCPUVendorIdentifier:%s\nCPUIdentifier:%s\nNo %d CPU Information:\nSystemCurrent Time:\nsystemBoot Time:\nIE BHO Name:%s\n11. IE BHO Information!\n10. IE Version Information!\n9. InstallApp Information!\n8. NETBIOS Information!\n7. Protocol Information!\n6. NET Information!\n5. Disk Information!\n4. Account Information!\n3. System Time!\n2. CPU Type!\nCan not get this information, error code is %d.\nWindows Version Information!\n\nAdditionally, Comfoo uses the SetEvent Windows API and registers an event that frequently\ncontains the word \"GAME\". The following are example Comfoo event names:\n\nexclusiveinstance12\nTHIS324NEWGAME\nMYGAMEHAVESTART\n\n\n-----\n\nMYGAMEHAVEstarted\nMYGAMEHAVESTARTEd\nMYGAMEHAVESTARTED\nthisisanewfirstrun\nTHISISASUPERNEWGAMENOWBEGIN\nthisisnewtrofor024\n\nTo persist without adding new registry entries, Comfoo edits an unused system service\nconfiguration, replacing the DLL path and setting it to auto-start on boot. For example, a\nsystem service registry key entry changed by Comfoo might resemble the following:\n\nsystem\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Netman\\Parameters\n\nOriginal: \"ServiceDll\" => \"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\netman.dll\"\nModified: \"ServiceDll\" => \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\tabcteng.dll\"\n\nsystem\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Netman\n\nOriginal: \"Start\" => \"3\"\nModified: \"Start\" => \"2\"\n\nComfoo hijacks service settings for some legitimate service DLLs:\n\nnetman.dll\nrasauto.dll\nsens.dll\n\nThe following are DLL names commonly used by Comfoo:\n\ncmmos.dll\njacpet.dll\njavadb.dll\nmszlobm.dll\nnetfram.dll\nnetman.dll\nntdapie.dll\nntdelu.dll\nntobm.dll\nodbm.dll\nsenss.dll\n\n\n-----\n\nsuddec.dll\ntabcteng.dll\nvmmreg32.dll\nwininete.dll\n\nIf Comfoo successfully connects to the relay server and receives commands from the master\nconsole, then it creates a file named \"mstemp.temp\" on the infected system to store the\noutput of the last shell command.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComfoo is the tip of an iceberg. The CTU research team notified many Comfoo victims,\neither directly or through the computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) in their\nrespective country. Analysis was also shared with law enforcement. Based on the number of\ncampaign tags observed in malware samples versus those seen in live monitoring by the\nCTU research team, there are likely hundreds more unidentified victims.\n\nMost businesses will never see a Comfoo infection. However, evaluating whether an\norganization is a potential target of cyber-espionage is important in any risk evaluation. Chief\ninformation security officers should maintain awareness of any reported cyber-espionage\nthreats in their business sector. If one player in an industry is targeted, it is likely all major\nplayers (or newcomers with interesting technology) in that industry will be targets at some\npoint.\n\nOrganizations compromised by Comfoo (or most types of APT malware) likely face a major\nforensic and eradication effort. This effort should be followed by a major investment in\nsecurity measures to keep cyber-espionage actors out of the network. Many in-house\n[security teams do not have the APT expertise to respond to a persistent threat that requires](http://go.secureworks.com/advancedthreats)\na persistent, active, and layered defense model spanning the entire attack surface of an\norganization. As a result, the organization might need outside expertise to effectively mitigate\nthese types of threats.\n\n**Appendix: Comfoo hostnames for blacklisting consideration**\n\n\naccounts . ddns .
