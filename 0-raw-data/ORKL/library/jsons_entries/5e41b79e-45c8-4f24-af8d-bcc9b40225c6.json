While this 1\n\nfocus on Taiwan aligns with the group’s past activity, we also observed wider targeting against entities\nin Hong Kong, Malaysia, Laos, the Philippines, South Korea, Kenya, Rwanda, Djibouti, and the United\nStates.\n\nInsikt Group identified 24 suspected victim organizations communicating with RedJuliett servers via a\nSoftEther bridge, including government organizations in Taiwan, Laos, Kenya, and Rwanda. RedJuliett\nalso conducted network reconnaissance or attempted exploitation against over 70 Taiwanese\norganizations in the academic, government, think tank, and technology sectors, as well as multiple de\nfacto embassies. The group targets internet-facing appliances such as firewalls, load balancers, and\nenterprise virtual private network (VPN) products for initial access, as well as attempting structured\nquery language (SQL) injection and directory traversal exploits against web and SQL applications. In\nsome cases, we identified RedJuliett conducting post-exploitation activity using open-source web\nshells and exploiting a known elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Linux operating system.\nAdditionally, RedJuliett used SoftEther to administer operational infrastructure consisting of both threat\nactor-controlled servers leased from virtual private server (VPS) providers and compromised\ninfrastructure belonging to three Taiwanese universities.\n\nInsikt Group assesses that RedJuliett likely operates out of Fuzhou, Fujian province, China, given that\nmultiple RedJuliett SoftEther nodes have been consistently administered from IP addresses that\ngeolocate to Fuzhou. This operating location aligns with the group’s persistent targeting of Taiwan.\nGiven the close geographical proximity between Fuzhou and Taiwan, Chinese intelligence services\noperating in Fuzhou are likely tasked with intelligence collection against Taiwanese targets.\n\nRedJuliett is likely targeting Taiwan to collect intelligence and support Beijing’s policy-making on\ncross-strait relations. RedJuliett displayed an interest in targeting critical technology companies, which\naligns with previous public [reporting. Targeting patterns also suggest that RedJuliett is likely interested](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/)\nin collecting intelligence on Taiwan’s economic policy and trade and diplomatic relations with other\ncountries. RedJuliett, like many [other Chinese threat actors, is likely targeting vulnerabilities in](https://www.recordedfuture.com/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power)\ninternet-facing devices because these devices have limited visibility and security solutions available,\nand targeting them has proven to be an effective way to scale initial access.\n\nDue to a focus on exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing devices and applications,\norganizations likely to be targeted by RedJuliett should complement routine vulnerability patching with\n\n1 RedJuliett closely overlaps with public reporting under the aliases Flax Typhoon (Microsoft) and Ethereal Panda (CrowdStrike).\n\n1 CTA-CN-2024-0624 [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nadditional defense-in-depth strategies. These strategies should emphasize detecting post-exploitation\npersistence, discovery, and lateral movement activities. Organizations should also regularly audit\ninternet-facing and perimeter appliances and reduce attack surfaces by disabling interfaces or portals\nwhere not required. Many public-facing appliances have limited visibility, logging capabilities, and\nsupport for traditional security solutions; organizations should consider these factors when initially\nprocuring network appliances to better detect and respond to threats.\n\nUnless the security of internet-facing devices is [improved or organizations take steps to move away](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/products-on-your-perimeter)\n[from vulnerable edges, Chinese state-sponsored threat actors will almost certainly continue](https://www.recordedfuture.com/2023-annual-report) to exploit\nthese devices. As Taiwan faces ongoing sovereignty threats from the People’s Republic of China (PRC)\nwhile simultaneously serving as a critical global technology and manufacturing hub, RedJuliett will\nalmost certainly continue to conduct high-tempo cyber-espionage operations with a focus on\nTaiwanese technology, government, educational, and think tank organizations.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - RedJuliett has likely compromised organizations in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Laos, the\nUnited States, Rwanda, Kenya, and Djibouti.\n\n  - Additionally, RedJuliett has conducted vulnerability scanning or attempted exploitation against\nde facto embassies, Taiwanese universities, government entities, think tanks focused on\nTaiwanese economic policy, aerospace companies, electronics manufacturers, computing\nindustry associations, and more.\n\n  - RedJuliett was observed administering multiple SoftEther nodes from suspected source-range\ninfrastructure geolocating to Fuzhou, Fujian province, China.\n\n  - Insikt Group anticipates that Chinese state-sponsored groups will continue to target Taiwanese\ngovernment agencies, universities, and critical technology companies. We also anticipate that\nRedJuliett will continue to focus on exploiting public-facing devices, as these have limited\nvisibility, logging capabilities, and support for traditional security solutions.\n\n## Background\n\n[As first reported by Microsoft in August 2023, Flax Typhoon (RedJuliett) has been observed primarily](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/)\ntargeting organizations in Taiwan using living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques and the open-source VPN\nsoftware SoftEther. The group has been active since mid-2021 and has targeted government agencies,\neducation, critical manufacturing, and IT organizations in Taiwan. To gain initial access to Taiwanese\nnetworks, Flax Typhoon exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing services, such as VPN, web, and SQL\napplications. The group then used the China Chopper web shell on compromised servers to establish\npersistence and remotely execute code. Following initial access, the group relied on open-source tools,\nsuch as JuicyPotato and BadPotato, and LotL techniques. CrowdStrike reporting on Ethereal Panda\n[notes very similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and the group’s use of the open-source](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/ethereal-panda/)\nweb shell Godzilla.\n\n2 CTA-CN-2024-0624 [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat and Technical Analysis\n\n**Figure 1: Overview of RedJuliett operations (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n\n#### RedJuliett SoftEther Infrastructure\n\n\n[In August 2023, Microsoft highlighted multiple self-signed transport layer security (TLS) certificates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/)\nused in Flax Typhoon (RedJuliett) activity targeting Taiwan, which were all generated through the\nopen-source client and server VPN software SoftEther (see Table 1). Insikt Group has observed\nRedJuliett continuing to reuse these certificates, allowing us to identify multiple new RedJuliett servers,\nincluding three likely compromised Taiwanese universities that served the TLS certificates.\n\n|SHA-1 TLS certificate fingerprint|Common name (CN)|\n|---|---|\n|7992c0a816246b287d991c4ecf68f2d32e4bca18|vpn437972693.sedns[.]cn2|\n|5437d0195c31bf7cedc9d90b8cb0074272bc55df|asljkdqhkhasdq.softether[.]net|\n|cc1f0cdc131dfafd43f60ff0e6a6089cd03e92f1|vpn472462384.softether[.]net|\n|2c95b971aa47dc4d94a3c52db74a3de11d9ba658|softether|\n\n\n**Table 1: Known RedJuliett SoftEther VPN self-signed TLS certificates (Source: Microsoft)**\n\n\n2 If SoftEther VPN Servers run within mainland China, the softether[.]net dynamic DNS domain is replaced with sedns[.]cn.

We have not observed evidence to confirm whether these\nentities were end targets of RedJuliett activity or were being used to facilitate further targeting of\nentities within Taiwan. However, observed scanning of additional Taiwanese universities and historical\n[industry reporting further supports the group’s interest in Taiwanese organizations within the education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/)\nsector.\n\n4 CTA-CN-2024-0624 [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Breakdown of RedJuliett targeting and victimology by geography and sector (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n#### Likely RedJuliett Victim Organizations Communicating with Threat Actor-Controlled SoftEther Servers\n\nIn early 2024, Insikt Group identified 24 suspected victim organizations regularly communicating to a\nRedJuliett SoftEther VPN server. This communication indicates that a SoftEther VPN bridge or client is\n[running within these victim networks, which aligns with historical public reporting](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/) on RedJuliett activity.\nVictimology mainly consisted of government, education, and religious organizations, as well as software\ncompanies (see Figure 3). Approximately 60% of identified victim organizations were in Taiwan, with\nothers in Hong Kong, South Korea, Laos, the United States, Rwanda, Kenya, and Djibouti.\n\n5 CTA-CN-2024-0624 [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nRedJuliett compromised government organizations in Taiwan, Laos, Kenya, and Rwanda. The group also\ntargeted the technology industry in Taiwan, including an optoelectronics company, a large Taiwanese\nfacial recognition company that has held contracts with the Taiwanese government, and four software\ncompanies. Multiple universities were also compromised, including three Taiwanese universities, an\nAmerican university, and a Djiboutian university. The group also targeted religious organizations in\nTaiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. Additionally, RedJuliett compromised a geological engineering\ncompany in Hong Kong, a Taiwanese waste and pollution treatment company, and a Taiwanese\npublishing house.\n\n**Figure 3: SuspectedRedJuliett victims by sector (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n#### RedJuliett Targets Internet-Facing Web Servers and Appliances\n\n[Using Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedJuliett using dedicated threat](https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020582674-Recorded-Future-Network-Intelligence-)\nactor-controlled SoftEther VPN servers to conduct reconnaissance and attempted exploitation activity\ntargeting a wide range of predominantly Taiwanese organizations from November 2023 to April 2024. In\naddition to acting as SoftEther VPN nodes, multiple RedJuliett IP addresses have been concurrently\nconfigured as Acunetix Web Application Security Scanners. Insikt Group has regularly observed\nvulnerability scanning and exploitation activity from these servers targeting web servers associated\n\n6 CTA-CN-2024-0624 [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nwith multiple Taiwanese organizations, predominantly in the government, education, and technology\nsectors.\n\nMost recently, Insikt Group observed RedJuliett attempt SQL injection, directory traversal, and other\nexploits targeting web applications of target entities in multiple cases. In a small number of cases, we\nobserved the group conduct post-exploitation activity using the open-source web shells devilzShell and\nAntSword and exploiting the Linux elevation of privilege vulnerability DirtyCow (CVE-2016-5195).\n\nInsikt Group also observed the group display an interest in probing internet-facing F5 BIG-IP and\nFortinet FortiGate devices, both of which are [commonly exploited](https://www.recordedfuture.com/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power) for initial access by a range of\nChinese state-sponsored groups. In multiple cases in late 2023, we also observed RedJuliett\ncommunicating with ZyXEL ZyWALL firewall devices located within Taiwan. While Insikt Group is unable\nto confirm the nature of these communications, we note recent reporting from TeamT5 [detailing](https://teamt5.org/en/posts/alerts-of-exploiting-zyxel-zywall-usg-20-50/)\nsuspected Chinese threat actors exploiting two vulnerabilities in ZyXEL ZyWALL devices in Taiwan since\nat least July 2023, likely for use as operational infrastructure in follow-on intrusion activity.\n\n##### Targets of RedJuliett Reconnaissance or Attempted Exploitation Activity\n\nBetween December 2023 and April 2024, Insikt Group observed RedJuliett reconnaissance or\nattempted exploitation activity targeting at least 75 organizations, predominantly in Taiwan and across\nthe government, education, and technology sectors (see Figure 4 for a full breakdown of targeting by\nsector). While we observed RedJuliett likely attempting to target all of these organizations, we could\nonly confirm post-exploitation activity in a small number of cases.\n\nWithin Taiwan, we observed RedJuliett heavily target the technology industry, including organizations in\ncritical technology fields. RedJuliett conducted vulnerability scanning or attempted exploitation against\na semiconductor company and two Taiwanese aerospace companies that have contracts with the\nTaiwanese military. The group also targeted eight electronics manufacturers, two universities focused\non technology, an industrial embedded systems company, a technology-focused research and\ndevelopment institute, and seven computing industry associations.\n\nRedJuliett also displayed an interest in Taiwan’s economic and trade policy and international affairs. The\ngroup targeted three de facto embassies from South and Southeast Asian countries, two government\ndepartments focused on economic policy, two think tanks conducting research on Taiwanese economic\npolicy, and a trade promotion organization. Additionally, RedJuliett conducted scanning or attempted\nexploitation against infrastructure associated with a multinational logistics company and two airlines.\nRedJuliett also targeted civil society, including two media organizations, a charity, and a\nnon-governmental organization (NGO) focused on human rights. Insikt Group observed RedJuliett\ntarget eight universities and eleven government entities in total.\n\nRedJuliett also conducted reconnaissance scanning or attempted exploitation of four organizations\noutside of Taiwan, including two government organizations in the Philippines, a government department\nin Djibouti, and a Malaysian airline.\n\n7 CTA-CN-2024-0624 [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed suspected administration activity\nfrom Chinanet IP addresses geolocating to Fuzhou, Fujian province, to multiple RedJuliett SoftEther\nservers. This traffic was consistent with established SoftEther VPN connections and interaction with an\ninternet-exposed Acunetix login panel. While RedJuliett’s potential affiliation with either China’s Ministry\nof State Security (MSS) or People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is currently unknown, an operating location\nwithin Fuzhou is consistent with the group’s persistent focus on Taiwan. Regional specialization has\n[been observed in the operations of both civilian](https://deserepi.org/0/joske_ssd.pdf) and [military intelligence organizations in China. Fuzhou](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Mark%20Stokes_Written%20Testimony060916.pdf)\nfalls within the PLA Eastern Theater Command, which heavily [focuses](https://jamestown.org/program/snapshot-chinas-eastern-theater-command/) on targeting Taiwan.\n\n8 CTA-CN-2024-0624 [Recorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com](http://www.recordedfuture.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\nWe recommend that users conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate observed TTPs\nassociated with RedJuliett activity:\n\n  - Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and\nthose being exploited in the wild as determined through the [Recorded Future Vulnerability](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\n[Intelligence module.
