Once limited to opportunistic criminals,\ncyber attacks are becoming a key weapon for governments seeking to defend national sovereignty\nand project national power.\n\nFrom strategic cyber espionage campaigns, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, to the destructive,\nsuch as military cyber strikes on Georgia and Iran, human and international conflicts are entering a new\nphase in their long histories. In this shadowy battlefield, victories are fought with bits instead of bullets,\nmalware instead of militias, and botnets instead of bombs.\n\nThese covert assaults are largely unseen by the public. Unlike the wars of yesteryear, this cyber war\nproduces no dramatic images of exploding warheads, crumbled buildings, or fleeing civilians. But the\nlist of casualties—which already includes some of the biggest names in technology, financial services,\ndefense, and government —is growing larger by the day.\n\nA cyber attack is best understood not as an end in itself, but as a potentially powerful means to a wide\nvariety of political, military, and economic goals.\n\n“Serious cyber attacks are unlikely to be motiveless,” said Martin Libicki, Senior Scientist at RAND Corp.\n“Countries carry them out to achieve certain ends, which tend to reflect their broader strategic goals.\nThe relationship between the means chosen and their goals will look rational and reasonable to them if\nnot necessarily to us.”\n\nJust as each country has a unique political system, history, and culture, state-sponsored attacks also\nhave distinctive characteristics, which include everything from motivation to target to type of attack.\n\nThis report describes the unique characteristics of cyber attack campaigns waged by governments\nworldwide. We hope that, armed with this knowledge, security professionals can better identify their\nattackers and tailor their defenses accordingly.\n\nHere is a quick overview:\n\n- **Asia-Pacific. Home to large, bureaucratic hacker groups such as the “Comment Crew” who pursue**\n\nmany goals and targets in high-frequency, brute-force attacks.\n\n- **Russia/Eastern Europe. These cyber attacks are more technically advanced and highly effective**\n\nat evading detection.\n\n- **Middle East. These hackers are dynamic, often using creativity, deception, and social engineering**\n\nto trick users into compromising their own computers.\n\n- **United States. The most complex, targeted, and rigorously engineered cyber attack campaigns**\n\nto date.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\n_World War Z—a bestselling book and Hollywood movie—detailed a global pandemic in which politics_\nand culture deeply influenced how the public—and by extension, governments—reacted to a zombie\nplague. In one passage, for example, an Arab boy refused to believe that the disease was real,\nsuspecting that Israel had fabricated the story. The nations described in World War Z—the United States,\nChina, Russia, South Korea, Israel, and many others—are involved in a very different type of conflict,\nbut one with real and growing national security impact: World War C, where “C” stands for “Cyber”.\nHowever, the same rule applies: each country has a unique political system, history, language, culture,\nand understanding of human and international conflict.\n\nCyber conflict often mirrors traditional conflict. For example, China uses high-volume cyber attacks\nsimilar to how it used infantry during the Korean War. Many Chinese soldiers were sent into battle with\nonly a handful of bullets. Given their strength in numbers, they were still able to achieve battlefield\nvictories. On the other end of the spectrum lie Russia, the U.S., and Israel, whose cyber tactics are more\nsurgical, reliant on advanced technologies and the cutting-edge work of contractors who are driven by\ncompetition and financial incentives.\n\nWe are still at the dawn of the Internet Age. But cyber attacks have already proven themselves as\na low-cost, high-payoff way to defend national sovereignty and to project national power. Many of\ntoday’s headlines seem to be pulled from the pages of a science fiction novel. Code so sophisticated it\ndestroys a nuclear centrifuge thousands of miles away. Malware that secretly records everything a user\ndoes on a computer. A software program that steals data from any nearby device that has Bluetooth\nconnectivity. Encrypted code that decrypts only on one specific, target device. Such sophistication\nspeaks volumes about the maturity, size, and resources of the organizations behind these attacks. With\na few rare exceptions, these attacks are now in the exclusive realm of nation-states.\n\n“The international community has developed a solid understanding of cyber technology,” said Prof.\nMichael N. Schmitt of the U.S. Naval War College, in an email interview. “What is missing is a grasp of\nthe geopolitical context in which such technology operates. Attribution determinations made without\nsensitivity to the geopolitical surroundings are seldom reasonable.”\n\n_World War C, like any analogy, has its limits. Cyber war has been compared to special operations_\nforces, submarine warfare, missiles, assassins, nuclear weapons, Pearl Harbor, 9/11, Katrina, and more.\nEven our zombie analogy is not new. Often, any compromised computer, if it is actively under the\nsurreptitious control of a cybercriminal, is called a zombie, and botnets are sometimes called zombie\narmies. Also, compared to stockpiling tanks and artillery, writing cyber attack code, and compromising\nthousands if not millions of computers, is easy. Moreover, malware often spreads with the exponential\ngrowth of an infectious disease.\n\nThis report examines many publicly known cyber attacks. By exploring some of the distinctive national\nor regional characteristics of these attacks, organizations can better identify their attackers, anticipate\nfuture attacks, and defend themselves.\n\n\n-----\n\n## A Word of Warning\n\nThe analytical waters surrounding cyber warfare are inherently murky. At the strategic level,\ngovernments desire to have a degree of plausible deniability. At the tactical level, military and\nintelligence organizations envelop such operations in layers of classification and secrecy. To be\neffective, information operations rely on deception—and the Internet offers an ideal venue for\na spy’s smoke and mirrors. In practical terms, hackers often run their attacks through cyber terrain\n(such as compromised, third-party networks) that present investigators with technical and jurisdictional\ncomplications. And finally, cybercriminal tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) evolve so quickly that\ncyber defense, legislation, and law enforcement remain behind the attacker’s curve.\n\n“The biggest challenge to deterring, defending against, or retaliating for cyber attacks is the problem\nof correctly identifying the perpetrator,” said Prof. John Arquilla, Naval Postgraduate School in an email\ninterview with FireEye.[®] “Ballistic missiles come with return addresses. But computer viruses, worms, and\ndenial of service attacks often emanate from behind a veil of anonymity. The best chance to pierce\nthis veil comes with the skillful blending of forensic back-hacking techniques with deep knowledge of\nothers’ strategic cultures and their geopolitical aims.”\n\nCyber “attribution”—identifying a likely culprit, whether an individual, organization, or nation-state—is\nnotoriously difficult, especially for any single attack. States are often mistakenly identified as non-state\nactors, and vice versa. To make matters worse, ties between the two are increasing. First, a growing\nnumber of “patriotic cybercriminals” ostensibly wage cyber war on behalf of governments (examples\ninclude Chechnya and Kosovo in the 1990s, China in 2001, Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and every\nyear in the Middle East).[1] Second, cybercrime organizations offer anyone, including governments, cyber\nattack services to include denial-of-service attacks and access to previously compromised networks.\n\nFireEye researchers have even seen one nation-state develop and use a sophisticated Trojan, and later\n(after its own counter-Trojan defenses were in place) sell it to cybercriminals on the black market. Thus,\nsome cyber attack campaigns may bear the hallmarks of both state and non-state actors, making\npositive attribution almost impossible. And finally, “false flag” cyber operations involve a hacker group\nbehaving like another to mislead cyber defense researchers.\n\n## The FireEye Perspective\n\nWithin the shadowy world of cyber warfare, FireEye occupies a unique position. First, our threat\nprotection platform has been installed on thousands of sensitive networks around the world. This gives\nour researchers a global and embedded presence in the cyber domain. Second, FireEye devices are\nplaced behind traditional security defenses such as firewalls, anti-virus, and intrusion prevention systems.\nThis means that our “false positive” rate is extremely low, and that the attacks we detect have already\nsucceeded in penetrating external network defenses.\n\n1 Geers K. (2008) “Cyberspace and the Changing Nature of Warfare,” Hakin9 E-Book, 19(3) No. 6; SC Magazine (27 AUG 08) 1-12.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Asia-Pacific\n\n**China—the elephant in the room**\nThe People’s Republic of China is the noisiest threat actor in cyberspace. The reasons for this include\nits huge population, a rapidly expanding economy, and a lack of good mitigation strategies on the\npart of its targets.\n\n**Chinese attacks on the U.S.**\nThe list of successful Chinese compromises is long, and spans the entire globe. Here are some of the\nmost significant incidents in the U.S.:\n\n- **Government: By 1999, the U.S. Department of Energy believed that China posed an “acute” threat**\n\nto U.S. nuclear security via cyber espionage.[2] By 2009, China apparently stole the plans for the most\nadvanced U.S. fighter jet, the F-35.[3]\n\n- **Technology: China hacked Google, Intel, Adobe, and RSA’s SecureID authentication technology—**\n\nwith which it then targeted Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and L-3 Communications.[4]\n\n- **Business and Financial Services: Morgan Stanley, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and numerous**\n\nbanks have been hacked.[5]\n\n- **Media: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and more have been targeted**\n\nby advanced, persistent cyber attacks emanating from China.[6]\n\n- **Critical Infrastructure: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported in 2013 that 23 gas**\n\npipeline companies were hacked (possibly for sabotage),[7] and that Chinese hackers were seen\nat the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ National Inventory of Dams.[8]\n\nSome of these cyber attacks have given China access to proprietary information such as research and\ndevelopment data. Others offer Chinese intelligence access to sensitive communications, from senior\ngovernment officials to Chinese political dissidents.\n\n2 Gerth, J. & Risen, J.

All traditional, geopolitical conflicts have moved into\ncyberspace, and Chinese compromises encompass the entire globe. But many contests have been\none-sided affairs, with all publicly known attacks emanating from China.\n\n- **Europe: In 2006, Chinese cybercriminals targeted the UK House of Commons;[9] in 2007, German**\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel raised the problem of nation-state hacking with China’s President;[10]\nin 2010, British MI5 warned that undercover Chinese intelligence officers had given UK business\nexecutives malware-laden digital cameras and memory sticks.[11]\n\n- **India: Indian officials worry that China could disrupt their computer networks during a conflict. One**\n\nexpert confided that an exclusive reliance on Chinese hardware might give China a “permanent”\ndenial-of-service capability.[12] One sophisticated attack on an Indian Navy headquarters allegedly\nused a USB vector to bridge the “air-gap” between a compartmentalized, standalone network and\nthe Internet.[13]\n\n- **South Korea: The South Korean government has complained for years of Chinese activity on its official**\n\ncomputers, including a 2010 compromise of the personal computers and PDAs belonging to much\nof South Korea’s government power structure[14] and a 2011 assault on an Internet portal that held\npersonal information for 35 million Koreans.[15]\n\n- **Japan: Here, the target list includes government, military, and high-tech networks. Chinese**\n\ncybercriminals have even stolen classified documents.[16]\n\n9 Warren, P.

The attack exposed data from 8,000 U.S. networks, 1,100 Australian\nnetworks, and 230 French networks.[19]\n\n**Chinese cyber tactics**\nThe People’s Republic of China (PRC) is home to 1.35 billion people, or more than four times the\npopulation of the United States. Therefore, China often has the ability to overwhelm cyber defenses with\nquantity over quality, just as it did in the Korean War and as it might do in any other type of conflict.\n\nThe Chinese malware that FireEye researchers have analyzed is not the most advanced or creative.\nBut in many circumstances, it has been no less effective. China employs brute-force attacks that are\noften the most inexpensive way to accomplish its objectives. The attacks succeed due to the sheer\nvolume of attacks, the prevalence and persistence of vulnerabilities in modern networks, and a seeming\nindifference on the part of the cybercriminals to being caught.\n\nMailing Lists, Previous Watering Hole Intel,\nReconnaissance\nCrawling, Mining Social Networks\n\nMasked EXEs to Appear Non-Executable\n\nWeaponization File Formats, Malicious Non-EXE File Formats,\n\nWatering Hole Attacks\n\nStrategic Web Compromises, Spear phish URLs\n\nDelivery in Email, Weaponized Email Attachments,\n\nWebserver compromise via scanning\n\n0-Day Browser / Application Vulnerabilities,\nExploitation\nSocial Engineering\n\nFeature Rich, Compact RATs with Minimal\n\nInstallation Evasion Capabilities (Requires Operator For\n\nLateral Movement)\n\nCommand and HTTP with Embedded, Standard Encodings\nControl (C2) (e.g., XOR), along with Custom Encodings\n\nIntelligence Gathering / Economic Espionage,\nActions on Objectives\nPersistent Access\n\nTTP Exemplars Comment Group\n\nTable 1: Characteristics of\nChinese cyber attacks\n\n17 “Report: Plans for Australia spy HQ hacked by China,” (28 May 2013) Associated Press.\n\n18 Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network (29 March 2009) Information Warfare Monitor.\n\n19 Vijayan, J.

The Comment Crew is behind many noteworthy attacks, including\nOperation Beebus, which targets U.S. aerospace and defense industries.[21]\n\nOne important characteristic of the Comment Crew—which puts it definitively in the category of an\nadvanced persistent threat, or APT—is that it is a bureaucracy. In-depth analysis reveals a small group\nof creative and strategic thinkers at the top. One layer down, a larger group of specialists design and\nproduce malware in an industrial fashion. At the bottom are the foot soldiers—brute-force hackers who\nexecute orders and wage extended cyber attack campaigns, from network reconnaissance to spear\nphishing to data exfiltration. The Comment Crew is so large, in fact, that when the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) decoded one of the group’s stolen caches of information, if printed out, it would\nhave created a stack of paper taller than a set of encyclopedias.[22]\n\nSuch a large bureaucracy helps to explain sometimes-incongruous cybercriminal behavior. A given\npiece of malware, for example, may have been written by an expert but incorrectly used later by an\ninexperienced foot soldier (such as a poorly written spear phishing email). Understanding this cyber\nattack life cycle and its different stages can help cyber defenders recognize and foil an attack. In any\nlarge organization, some processes are less mature than others, and therefore easier to recognize.\n\n**Chinese cyber defense**\nIn its own defense, Chinese officials contend that their country is also a target of cyber attacks. In 2006,\nthe China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation (CASIC) found spyware on its classified network.[23]\nIn 2007, the Chinese Ministry of State Security stated that foreign cybercriminals were stealing Chinese\ninformation, with 42 percent of attacks coming from Taiwan and 25 percent from the United States.[24]\nIn 2009, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao announced that a cybercriminal from Taiwan had stolen\nhis upcoming report to the National People’s Congress.[25] In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former system\nadministrator at the National Security Agency (NSA), published documents suggesting that the U.S.\nconducted cyber espionage against China;[26] and the Chinese Computer Emergency Response Team\n(CERT) stated that it possessed “mountains of data” on cyber attacks by the U.S.[27]\n\n20 Sanger, D., Barboza, D. & Perlroth, N.

(5 Jun 2013) “China claims ‘mountains of data’ on cyber attacks by US,” Financial Times.\n\n\n-----\n\n**North Korea—the upstart**\nNorth and South Korea remain locked in one of the most intractable conflicts on Earth. North Korea\n(supported by China) would seem to be stuck in a cyber Stone Age—especially relative to South Korea\n(supported by the U.S.)—has the fastest download speeds in the world[28] and will issue its students with\ncomputer tablets instead of books by 2015.[29] Even so, the Internet offers anyone, and any nation, an\nasymmetric way to gather intelligence and project national power in cyberspace—and North Korea\nappears to have acquired cyber attacks as a new weapon for its arsenal.\n\nIn 2009, North Korea launched its first major assault on South Korean and U.S. government websites. The\nattack did little damage, but the incident gained wide media exposure.[30] By 2013, however, the threat\nactors had matured. A group dubbed the “DarkSeoul Gang” was responsible for at least four years of\nhigh-profile attacks on South Korea. The group’s attacks included a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)\nattack and malicious code that wiped computer hard drives at banks, media, ISPs, telcos, and financial\nservices companies—overwriting legitimate data with political messages. In the Korean conflict, such\nincidents often take place on dates of historical significance, including July 4, the U.S. Independence\nDay.[31] Suspected North Korean attacks on U.S. institutions include U.S. military elements based in South\nKorea, the U.S.-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, and even the White House.\n\nNorth Korean defectors have described a burgeoning cyberwarfare department of 3,000 personnel,\nlargely trained in China and Russia. The defectors stressed that North Korea has a growing\nfascinationwith cyber attacks as a cost-effective way to compete against its conventionally superior\nfoes. They believe that North Korea is growing increasingly comfortable and confident in this new\nwarfare domain, assessing that the Internet is not only vulnerable to attack but that this strategy can\ncreate psychological pressure on the West. Toward this end, North Korea has focused on disconnecting\nits important servers from the Internet, while building a dedicated “attack network.”[32]\n\nFireEye researchers have seen a heavy use of spear phishing and the construction of a “watering hole,”\nin which an important website is hacked in the hope of compromising the computers of its subsequent\nvisitors, who usually belong to a certain VIP-profile the attacker is targeting. Some North Korean attacks\nhave begun to manipulate a victim’s operating system settings and disable their anti-virus software—\ntechniques that are normally characteristic of Russian cybercriminals. In other words, North Korean\nhackers may have learned from or have contracted support in Russia.\n\nApart from any possible disruption or destruction stemming from cyber attacks, computer network\noperations are an invaluable tool for collecting sensitive information, especially when it resides on\ngovernment or think-tank networks normally inaccessible from the Internet. North Korea, China, and\nRussia are all naturally interested in collecting cyber intelligence that would increase their comparative\nadvantage in classified information, diplomatic negotiating positions, or future policy changes.\n\n28 McDonald, M.

(20 March 2013) “South Korea under cyber attack: Is North Korea secretly awesome at hacking?” The Washington Post.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the same time, North Korea also asserts that it is a target of cyber attacks from South Korea and the\nU.S. In June 2013, when the North suffered a two-day outage of all of its in-country websites, its state\nnews agency denounced “concentrated and persistent virus attacks,” and proclaimed that the U.S.\nand South Korea “will have to take the responsibility for the whole consequences.” The North noted that\nthe attack took place in parallel with Key Resolve (joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises), but the\nU.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff denied any connection.[33]\n\n**India-Pakistan: old rivals, new tactics**\nA heavily fortified border separates India and Pakistan on the map. But the quiet, borderless nature\nof cyberspace means both sides are free to engage in cyber warfare—even during peacetime.\n\nIn 2009, India announced that Pakistani cybercriminals had placed malware on popular Indian music\ndownload sites as a clever, indirect way to compromise Indian systems.[34] In 2010, the “Pakistani Cyber\nArmy” defaced and subsequently shut down the website of the Central Bureau of Investigation, India’s\ntop police agency.[35] In 2012, over 100 Indian government websites were compromised.[36]\n\nNot to be outdone, in 2013, cybercriminals in India undertook “Operation Hangover,” a large-scale\nIndian cyber espionage campaign that hit Pakistani IT, mining, automotive, legal, engineering, food\nservice, military, and financial services networks.[37] Although researchers could not definitively tie the\nattacks to India’s government, many of the targets represented the country’s national security interests.[38]\n\n**Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): emerging economies as soft targets**\nSince at least 2010, many APTs (likely China-based) have targeted the governments, militaries, and\nbusinesses of ASEAN, the Southeast Asian geopolitical and economic group composed of Brunei,\nBurma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nAlthough chances of any regional war erupting in the near term are low, a large volume of ongoing,\nregional cyber espionage activity is a constant. Targeted industries include telecommunications,\ntransportation, oil and gas, banks, and think tanks. The usual motivation is to gain tactical or strategic\nadvantage within the political, military, and economic domains.[39]\n\nFireEye researchers are following numerous APT actors in this region, including BeeBus, Mirage, Check\nCommand, Taidoor, Seinup, and Naikon. Their most common tactic is spear phishing, often using\nlegitimate decoy documents that are related to the target’s national economy or politics, or to regional\nevents such as ASEAN summits, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summits, energy exploration,\nor military affairs.\n\n33 Herman, S.

(4 Aug 2011) “’State actor’ behind slew of cyber attacks,” Reuters.\n\n\n-----\n\nFireEye believes that many of these regional economic organizations are attractive targets for APT\ncampaigns because the information they possess is valuable and their level of cyber security awareness\nis low. Often, these organizations have inconsistent system administration, infrequent software patch\nmanagement, poor policy control, or some combination of these issues. Thus, many of these networks\nare “low-hanging fruit” for attackers. And to make matters worse, compromised systems are used as\nstaging grounds for further attacks on regional targets, by installing illicit command-and-control (CnC)\nservers, abusing legitimate email accounts, and disseminating stolen office documents as “bait.”\n\n## Russia/Eastern Europe\n\n**Russia—a little bit “too quiet?”**\nIn 1939, Winston Churchill declared that Russia was a “riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma …”.\nSeven decades later, cyber defense researchers would say that not much has changed. Compared\nwith the constant attacks detected from China, you can almost hear the snow falling on Red Square.\nOne of the outstanding questions in cyber security today is: Where are the Russians? Perhaps they are\nsimply great hackers. Maybe they have sufficient human intelligence. Whatever the reason, cyber\ndefense analysts often look in vain for the traces of Russian cybercriminals. As a step toward finding\nsome answers, however, consider the second half of Churchill’s quote: “… but perhaps there is a key—\nthat key is Russian national interest.”[40] In other words, where there is smoke, there is usually fire.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, at the very dawn of the World Wide Web, Russia was engaged in a protracted struggle\nover the fate of Chechnya; the Chechens became pioneers in cyber propaganda, and the Russians\nbecame pioneers is shutting down their websites. In 1998, when Russian ally Serbia was under attack from\nNATO, pro-Serbian hackers jumped in the fray, targeting NATO with DoS attacks and at least twenty-five\nstrains of virus-infected email. In 2007, Russia was the prime suspect in the most famous international cyber\nattack to date—the punitive DDoS on Estonia for moving a Soviet-era statue.[41]\n\nIn 2008, researchers uncovered clear evidence that computer network operations played a supporting\nrole in Russian military advances during its invasion of Georgia.[42] Also in 2008, Russia was suspected in\nwhat U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn called the “most significant breach of U.S. military\ncomputers ever”—an attack on Central Command (CENTCOM), delivered through an infected USB\ndrive.[43] In 2009, Russian cybercriminals were blamed in “Climategate,” a breach of university research\nintended to undermine international negotiations on climate change mitigation.[44] In 2010, NATO and\nthe European Union warned of increased Russian cyber attacks, while the FBI arrested and deported a\npossible Russian intelligence agent named Alexey Karetnikov, who had been working as a software\ntester at Microsoft.[45]\n\n40 “Winston Churchill,” Wikiquote.\n\n41 Geers K.

(14 Jul 2010) “Microsoft Says 12th Alleged Russian Spy Was Employee,” Bloomberg.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne ironic aspect of nation-state cyber attacks—especially in authoritarian countries—is that many\nof them are inward facing. In 2012, Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab announced the discovery of\n“Red October,”[46] a cyber attack campaign that spied on millions of citizens around the world, but\nchiefly within the former Soviet Union. Targets included embassies, research firms, military bases, energy\nproviders, nuclear agencies, and critical infrastructure.[47] Similarly, in 2013, researchers found malware\non millions of Android devices in Russia and in Russian-speaking countries. Either or both of these attacks\ncould be partially explained as the Russian government keeping an eye on its own population, and that\nof neighboring countries.[48]\n\nOn the brighter side, as a step toward cyber détente, the U.S. and Russia in 2013 signed an agreement\nto build a cyber “hotline”—similar to that used for nuclear scares during the Cold War—to help defuse\nany computer-related crises in the future.[49] But, just to be on the safe side, Russia is taking the extreme\ncyber defense measure of buying old-fashioned typewriters,[50] and the Russian military is (like the U.S.,\nChina, and Israel) creating cyber warfare-focused units.[51]\n\n**Russian tactics**\nThough relatively quiet, Russia appears to be home to many of the most complex and advanced\ncyber attacks FireEye researchers have seen. More specifically, Russian exploit code can be significantly\nstealthier than its Chinese counterpart—which can also make it more worrisome. The “Red October”\ncampaign, including its satellite software dubbed “Sputnik,” is a prominent example of likely\nRussian malware.\n\nTTP often includes the delivery of weaponized email attachments, though Russian cybercriminals\nappear to be adept at changing their attack patterns, exploits, and data exfiltration methods to\nevade detection. In fact, one telltale aspect of Russian hackers seems to be that, unlike the Chinese,\nthey go to extraordinary lengths to hide their identities and objectives. FireEye analysts have even\nseen examples in which they have run “false-flag” cyber operations, designing their attack to appear\nas if it came from Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne further problem for cyber defense researchers is that some Russian back doors into compromised\nsystems are hard to distinguish from advanced cybercriminal break-ins.\n\nReconnaissance Likely HUMINT Sources\n\nWeaponization Malicious DOC/XLS File Formats\n\nDelivery Weaponized Email Attachments\n\nExploitation 0-Day Application Vulnerabilities\n\nInstallation Feature Rich RAT with Encrypted Modules\n\nCommand and HTTP with Custom Embedded Encoding /\nControl (C2) Encryption\n\nActions on Objectives Intelligence Gathering (Govt.

Therefore, some Middle Eastern hackers may have to rely on cyber\ntactics that emphasize novelty, creativity, and deception.\n\nFor example, the 2012 Mahdi campaign, which infected targets in the Middle East, used malicious\nWord documents, PowerPoint files, and PDFs to infect targets. That approach is similar to many other\nattackers. But these attacks were accompanied by some imaginative elements such as games,\nattractive images, and custom animations specifically designed to aid in the attack.\n\nNot only did they trick users into executing commands to install malicious code, but they also distracted\nusers from seeing malware-related warning messages. Furthermore, Mahdi attacks were tailored to\nspecific target audiences—for example by offering variations of games unique to each organization.\nSuch pinpoint strikes rely on prior reconnaissance, help to evade cyber defense behavioral-detection\nmechanisms, and dramatically increase the odds of compromise. So in the Middle East, the relative\nsophistication of an attack may be calculated less in the technology, and more in the clever ways in\nwhich malware is delivered and installed on a target network.\n\n|Reconnaissance|Likely HUMINT Sources|\n|---|---|\n|Weaponization|Malicious DOC/XLS File Formats|\n|Delivery|Weaponized Email Attachments|\n|Exploitation|0-Day Application Vulnerabilities|\n|Installation|Feature Rich RAT with Encrypted Modules|\n|Command and Control (C2)|HTTP with Custom Embedded Encoding / Encryption|\n|Actions on Objectives|Intelligence Gathering (Govt.

It is therefore unsurprising that Iran—which has tense international\nrelations and is on the verge of acquiring a nuclear bomb—has also experienced the most\nsophisticated cyber attacks to date.\n\nIn 2010, Stuxnet was a “cyber missile” of sorts designed with painstaking precision to burrow deep\ninto Iran’s nuclear program and destroy physical infrastructure. To some degree, this piece of software\nreplaced a squadron of fighter aircraft that would have violated foreign airspace, dropped laserguided bombs, and left a smoking crater in the Earth’s surface.[52] Beyond Stuxnet, other advanced\nespionage attacks have worried security experts, including Duqu, Flame, and Gauss, which all may\nhave come from the same threat actor.[53] And even amateurs are successfully targeting Iran; although\nthe “Mahdi” malware is by comparison far less sophisticated than Stuxnet and its cousins, Mahdi has\nstill managed to compromise engineering firms, government agencies, financial services firms, and\nacademia throughout the Middle East.[54]\n\n52 Sanger, D.

(31 Aug 2012) “Bungling Cyber Spy Stalks Iran,” MIT Technology Review.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo how does anyone, including a nation-state, respond to a cyber attack? Does the counterstrike\nremain within the cyber realm, or can it come in the form of a traditional military (or terrorist) assault? In\n2012, Iran appears to have chosen the first option. A hacker group called the “Cutting Sword of Justice”\nused the “Shamoon” virus to attack the Saudi Arabian national oil company Aramco, deleting data on\nthree-quarters of Aramco’s corporate PCs (including documents, spreadsheets, e-mails, and files) and\nreplacing them with an image of a burning American flag.[55] And over the past year, another group\ncalled Izz ad-Din al-Qassam launched “Operation Ababil,” a series of DDoS attacks against many U.S.\nfinancial institutions including the New York Stock Exchange.[56]\n\nOther examples of cyber attacks abound. In 2009, the plans for a new U.S. Marine Corps 1 presidential\nhelicopter were found on a file-sharing network in Iran.[57] In 2010, the “Iranian Cyber Army” disrupted\nTwitter and the Chinese search engine Baidu, redirecting users to Iranian political messages.[58] In 2011,\nIranian attackers compromised a Dutch digital certificate authority, after which it issued more than\n500 fraudulent certificates for major companies and government agencies.[59] In 2012, Iran disrupted\nthe BBC’s Persian Language Service, and University of Toronto researchers reported that some versions\nof the Simurgh “proxy” software (which is popular in countries like Iran and anonymizes Internet traffic)\nalso installed a Trojan that collected usernames and keystrokes, sending them to a likely intelligence\ncollection site.[60] Finally, in 2013 the Wall Street Journal reported that Iranian actors had increased their\nefforts to compromise U.S. critical infrastructure.[61]\n\n**Syria: what is the Syrian Electronic Army?**\nSyria is in the midst of a civil war, so researchers have a lot of cyber activity to analyze. The most\nprominent hacker group by far is the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), which is loyal to Syrian President\nBashar al-Assad. SEA has conducted DDoS attacks, phishing, pro-Assad defacements, and spamming\ncampaigns against governments, online services, and media that are perceived to be hostile to\nthe Syrian government. SEA has hacked Al-Jazeera, Anonymous, Associated Press (AP), BBC, Daily\n_Telegraph, Financial Times, Guardian, Human Rights Watch, National Public Radio, The New York Times,_\nTwitter, and more.[62] Its most famous exploit was a hoax announcement using AP’s Twitter account that\nthe White House was bombed and President Obama injured—after which stock markets briefly dipped\nto the tune of $200 billion.[63]\n\n55 Perlroth, N.

(25 July, 2013) “Slaves to the algorithm: Are stock market math geniuses, or quants, a force for good?” The Sunday Telegraph.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the month of July 2013 alone, SEA compromised three widely used online communications websites:\nTruecaller (the world’s largest telephone directory),[64] Tango (a video and text messaging service),[65] and\nViber (a free online calling and messaging application).[66] These types of compromises are significant\nbecause they can give Syrian intelligence access to the communications of millions of people, including\npolitical activists within Syria who might then be targeted for espionage, intimidation, and arrest.\n\nTo compromise its targets, the SEA often sends socially engineered, spear-phishing emails to lure\nopposition activists into opening fraudulent, weaponized, and malicious documents. If the recipient falls\nfor the scam, Trojan horse, remote access tool (RAT) software is installed on the victim’s computer that\ncan give the attacker keystrokes, screenshots, microphone and webcam recordings, stolen documents,\nand passwords. And of course, the SEA likely sends all of this information to a computer address lying\nwithin Syrian government-controlled Internet Protocol (IP) space for intelligence collection and review.[67]\n\n**Israel: old conflict, new tactics**\nEven during the Cold War, the Arab-Israeli conflict saw many hot wars, and it was often the testing\nground for new military weapons and tactics. Nothing has changed in the Internet era. Since at least\n2000, pro-Israeli hackers have targeted sites of political and military significance in the Middle East.[68]\nIn 2007, Israel reportedly disrupted Syrian air defense networks via cyber attack (with some collateral\ndamage to its own domestic networks) to facilitate the Israeli Air Force’s destruction of an alleged\nSyrian nuclear facility.[69]\n\n64 Khare, A.

(26 Nov 2007) “Israel’s Cyber Shot at Syria,” Defense Tech.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut as an advanced industrial nation, Israel also depends on information technology. The nation has\nproven to be vulnerable to cyber attacks, which often target the Israeli economy. In 2009, during Israel’s\nmilitary operation in Gaza, hackers briefly paralyzed many government sites with a DDoS attack from at\nleast 500,000 computers. The 2009 attack consisted of four independent waves, each stronger than the\nlast, peaking at 15 million junk mail deliveries per second. The Israeli “Home Front Command” website,\nwhich plays a key role in national defense communications with the public, was down for three hours.\nDue to technical similarities with the 2008 cyber attack on Georgia during its war with Russia, Israeli\nofficials surmised that the attack itself might have been carried out by a criminal organization in the\nformer Soviet Union, and paid for by Hamas or Hezbollah.[70]\n\nOften, the trouble with cyber attacks is that they do not need to be highly sophisticated to succeed,\neven against security-conscious Israel. In 2012, the ineptly written[71] “Mahdi” malware compromised at\nleast 54 targets in Israel.[72] Last but not least, in 2013, the Iranian media reported that the Syrian army had\ncarried out a cyber attack against the water supply of the Israeli city of Haifa. Prof. Isaac Ben-Israel, a\ncyber security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the report was false, but added\nthat cyber attacks on critical infrastructures pose a “real and present threat” to Israel.[73]\n\n## The West\n\n**United States**\nAnalysts believe that the U.S. has conducted the most highly engineered cyber attacks to date,\nincluding Stuxnet,[74] Duqu, Flame, and Gauss.[75] This family of malware is unparalleled in its complexity\nand targeting. Stuxnet in particular was developed with a singular goal (to disrupt Iranian nuclear\nenrichment) that was both narrowly focused and capable of yielding strategic gains in the international\narena. In contrast to computer worms such as Slammer and Code Red, Stuxnet did not seek to\ncompromise as many computers as possible, but as few as possible. Even more amazing, its malicious\nbehavior was concealed under a veneer of apparently legitimate operational data—but ultimately,\nthe malware destroyed Iranian centrifuges.\n\nThis family of malware was exquisitely designed. For example, its payload can arrive at its destination\nencrypted—and become decrypted and installed only on a target device. This helps the malware to\nevade the prying eyes of cyber defenders, making discovering and reverse engineering the malware\nmuch more difficult.\n\nIronically, this family of malware could be a paragon of over-engineering. For example, it not only\nuses multiple zero-day exploits, but also world-first computational achievements such as a forced\ncryptographic “hash collision.”[76] In the case of Iran (which is currently subject to a trade embargo\nthat restricts its acquisition of high technology), it is doubtful whether Iranian software is up-to-date or\nproperly configured. So the authors of Stuxnet could likely have used more conventional computer\nexploits and still succeeded.\n\n70 Pfeffer, A.

On the last point,\nRichard Clarke, who served three U.S. Presidents as a senior counterterrorism official, argued that Stuxnet\nwas a U.S. operation because “it very much had the feel to it of having been written by or governed\nby a team of Washington lawyers.”[77] Finally, the amount of work involved in these operations suggests\nthe participation of an enormous defense contractor base, with different companies specializing in\nparticular aspects of a large and complex undertaking.\n\nOn the downside (and similar to the Israeli case), all advanced industrial economies are vulnerable\nto cyber counterattack. In 2008, a CIA official informed a conference of critical infrastructure providers\nthat unknown cybercriminals, on multiple occasions, had been able to disrupt the power supply in\nvarious foreign cities.[78] In the military domain, Iraqi insurgents used $26 off-the-shelf software to intercept\nlive video feeds from U.S. Predator drones, likely giving them the ability to monitor and evade U.S.\nmilitary operations.[79] In the economic sphere, the U.S.-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) fell\nvictim to a phishing attack in 2011 that was described as a “very major breach.”[80]\n\nThus, while cyber attacks are relatively a new phenomenon, they represent a growing national security\nchallenge. As part of a broader effort to mitigate the threat, President Obama signed a directive in\n2013 that the U.S. should aid allies who come under foreign cyber attack.[81]\n\n77 Rosenbaum, R.

On the contrary, their leaders have\nso far foresworn them.[82] But many examples reveal European networks getting hacked from other parts\nof the world, particularly China and Russia.\n\nWithin government, cyber attacks on the British Foreign Ministry evaded network defenses in 2010 by\npretending to come from the White House.[83] In 2011, German Police found that servers used to locate\nserious criminals and terrorism suspects had been penetrated, initially via a phishing attack.[84] Also in 2011,\nEuropean Commission officials were targeted at an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in Azerbaijan.[85]\n\nIn the military sphere, in 2009, French Navy planes were grounded following an infection by the\nConficker worm.[86] In 2012, the UK admitted that cybercriminals had penetrated its classified Ministry of\nDefense networks.[87]\n\nIn business, the European Union’s carbon trading market was breached in 2011, resulting in the theft\nof more than $7 million in credits, forcing the market to shut down temporarily.[88] In 2012, the European\nAeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) and German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp fell victim to\nmajor attacks by Chinese cybercriminals.[89]\n\nSecurity professionals should particularly be on the lookout for APT cyber threats just before and during\ninternational negotiations. In 2011 alone, the European Commission complained of widespread hacking\nbefore an EU summit,[90] the French government was compromised prior to a G-20 meeting,[91] and at\nleast 10 Norwegian defense and energy companies were breached during large-scale contract\nnegotiations, via phishing that was specifically tailored to each company.[92]\n\n82 Leyden, J.

Behind every incident is an agenda—and individual\nhuman beings—each unique and ultimately identifiable. The bigger the cyber campaign, the more\ndata it generates for security researchers, and the more difficulty attackers will have remaining\nanonymous and hiding their agenda.\n\nAs for crystal balls: no one knows what the next cyber attack will look like. But considering recent trends,\nwe can make a few educated guesses.\n\nHere are five factors that could change the world’s cyber security landscape in the near- to medium-term:\n\n**1.** **Outage of national critical infrastructure: we know that cyber attacks can disrupt government**\n\nnetworks, but most current cases simply do not rise to the level of a national security threat. Stuxnet—\nand Iran’s alleged retaliation against Saudi Aramco—has shifted the thinking on cyber war from\ntheory to something closer to reality. But have we seen the limit of what cyber attacks can achieve,\nor could cybercriminals threaten public safety by downing a power grid or financial market?\n\n**2.** **Cyber arms treaty: if world leaders begin to view cyber attacks as more of a liability than an**\n\nopportunity, they may join a cyber arms control regime or sign a non-aggression pact for\ncyberspace. However, arms control requires the ability to inspect for a prohibited item. President\nReagan’s favorite Russian proverb was доверяй, но проверяй, or “trust but verify.” Given that a single\nUSB stick can now hold billions of bits of information, verifying would be easier said than done.\n\n**3.** **PRISM, freedom of speech, and privacy: we are still at the dawn of the Internet era, and this**\n\nconversation has only just begun. It encompasses Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning, and Edward\nSnowden, as well as the Declaration of Independence, Enigma, and The Onion Router (TOR). Today,\npoliticians, spooks, and hippies are all aware of a critical debate on the horizon—just how much\nonline privacy should we have?\n\n**4.** **New actors on the cyber stage: the revolutionary nature of computers and the amplification power**\n\nof networks are not exclusive to the world’s largest nations. Iran, Syria, North Korea, and even nonstate actors such as Anonymous have employed cyber attacks as a way to conduct diplomacy and\nwage war by other means. Researchers have little reason to think that other governments are not\nactive in this domain. Possible candidates could be:\n\n**a.** **Poland: it was the Poles who first broke the German Enigma cipher—way back in 1932!**\nToday, with programming talent and well-known rivalry with Russia, it is a possibility.\n\n**b.** **Brazil: Home to some of the world’s most prolific cybercriminals, will Brazil’s government,**\nbe angry about recent revelations of U.S. cyber spying, harness this talent for geopolitical ends?\n\n**c.** **Taiwan: with constant cyber attacks emanating from Mainland China, Taipei may have**\nlittle choice but to react.\n\n**5.** **Stronger focus on evasion: as we have seen, some nation-states know how to launch stealthy cyber**\n\nattacks. But as the discipline of cyber defense matures, and as public awareness of the World War C\nphenomenon grows, some “noisy” cyber attackers such as China may be forced to raise their game\nby trying to fly under a more finely tuned radar.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe analysis and conclusions drawn in this paper are conjectural. Cyber security, cyber espionage,\nand cyber war are new and rapidly evolving concepts. Furthermore, most computer network\noperations are shrouded in secrecy. Deception is a given.\n\n“A cyber attack, viewed outside of its geopolitical context, allows very little legal maneuvering room\nfor the defending state,” said Prof. Thomas Wingfield of the Marshall Center, in a recent email interview\nwith FireEye. “False flag operations and the very nature of the Internet make tactical attribution a\nlosing game.”\n\nBut Wingfield adds that strategic attribution—fusing all sources of intelligence on a potential threat—\nallows a much higher level of confidence and more options for government decision makers.\n\n“And strategic attribution begins and ends with geopolitical analysis,” he said.\n\nWith this in mind, we hope that an awareness of this World War C dynamic helps cyber security\nprofessionals better understand, identify, and combat cyber attacks in the future.\n\n**About FireEye**\nFireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual machine-based security platform that provides real-time\nthreat protection to enterprises and governments worldwide against the next generation of cyber\nattacks.
