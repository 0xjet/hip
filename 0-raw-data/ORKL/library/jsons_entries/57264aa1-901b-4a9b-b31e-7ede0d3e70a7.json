There\nare indications that the same attack methods may have been used in this intrusion as with\nbreaches at Anthem and Premera, incidents that collectively involved data on more than 90\nmillion Americans.\n\nAccording to [a statement CareFirst issued Wednesday,](http://www.carefirstanswers.com/)\nattackers gained access to names, birth dates, email\naddresses and insurance identification numbers. The\ncompany said the database did not include Social\nSecurity or credit card numbers, passwords or medical\ninformation. Nevertheless, CareFirst is offering credit\nmonitoring and identity theft protection for two years.\n\nNobody is officially pointing fingers at the parties\nthought to be responsible for this latest health industry\nbreach, but there are clues implicating the same statesponsored actors from China thought to be involved in\nthe Anthem and Premera attacks.\n\nAs I noted in [this Feb. 9, 2015 story, Anthem was breached not long after a malware](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/anthem-breach-may-have-started-in-april-2014/)\ncampaign was erected that mimicked Anthem’s domain names at the time of the breach.\nPrior to its official name change at the end of 2014, Anthem was known as Wellpoint.\nSecurity researchers at cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect Inc. had uncovered a series of\nsubdomains for we11point[dot]com (note the “L’s” in the domain were replaced by the\nnumeral “1”) — including myhr.we11point[dot]com and hrsolutions.we11point[dot]com.\n\nThreatConnect also found that the domains were registered in April 2014 (approximately the\ntime that the Anthem breach began), and that the domains were used in conjunction with\nmalware designed to mimic a software tool that many organizations commonly use to allow\nemployees remote access to internal networks.\n\n[On Feb. 27, 2015, ThreatConnect published more information tying the same threat actors](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/)\nand modus operandi to a domain called “prennera[dot]com” (notice the use of the double\n“n” there to mimic the letter “m”).\n\n“It is believed that the prennera[dot]com domain may have been impersonating the\n[Healthcare provider Premera Blue Cross, where the attackers used the same character](http://www.premera.com/)\nreplacement technique by replacing the ‘m’ with two ‘n’ characters within the faux domain,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe same technique that would be seen five\nmonths later with the we11point[dot]com\ncommand and control infrastructure,”\nThreatConnect observed in a February 2015\nblog post.\n\nTurns out, the same bulk registrant in China that\nregistered the phony Premera and Anthem\ndomains in April 2014 also registered two\nCarefirst look-alike domains —\n**careflrst[dot]com (the “i” replaced with an “L”)**\nand caref1rst[dot]com (the “i” replaced with the\nnumber “1”).\n\nAdditionally, ThreatConnect has [unearthed evidence showing the same tactics were used on](https://www.anthemfacts.com/)\n**EmpireB1ue.com (note the “L” replaced with a number “1”), a domain registered April 11,**\n2014 (the same day as the phony Carefirst domains).
