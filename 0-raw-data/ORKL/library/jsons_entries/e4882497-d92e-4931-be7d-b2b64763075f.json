The latest victim\nlost over€5,000 to the scam but luckily was able to track down where the moneyhad been\nsent. Unfortunately the final destination for the money was aWestern Union outlet in\nGreece, after having been first sent through amoney mule in the US.\n\nOnce Trojan.Bayrob is executed on a user’s system it can interceptall traffic to eBay. It can\nthen show the infected user any contentthat it chooses instead of the real pages and it can\nalso alterinformation that is shown to the user from the real pages.Trojan.Bayrob is used to\nscam people who are trying to buy cars oneBay.\n\nThe attack is a targeted attack and as such it is difficult toestablish the exact methods that\nare used to distribute the Trojan;however, from evidence gathered thus far the attack works\nin a mannersimilar to the following:\n\n - The attacker posts an auction on eBay.\n\n - This auction is used to gain information about potential buyers/victims.\n\n - Anyone who asks a question about the auction may become a target.\n\n - If a user asks a question about the item the attacker will reply,sending the Trojan disguised\nas further pictures of the car for sale.In the past we have seen the file name\nDisplayPics.exe used.\n\n - The email may also give a plausible explanation as to why the car isa great offer. The\nemail also states that the car has been re-listed oneBay since it did not sell during the\nprevious auction.\n\n - When the user opens “Displaypics.exe” the Trojan shows a slide showof the car for sale,\nusing “Kodak Viewer Express” however it also dropsanother file silently in the background\nand executes it as well.\n\nThe images that were used in this case were for a Jeep:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Click for larger image**\n\nAt this point the Trojan is running in the background. All trafficdestined for eBay.com is now\nsilently intercepted by the Trojan. Then adecision is made as to whether the infected user\nshould be shown thereal eBay pages or if fake eBay pages should be displayed\ninstead.Anytime the infected user tries to view pages that are related to thecar they are\ninterested in buying, the Trojan will make the decision toshow fake pages instead of the real\neBay pages. These fake pages canshow a variety of fake information, including inflated\nratings for theseller and fake positive feedback for the seller.\n\nThe Trojan is specifically designed to make sure that the user does notnotice any difference\nbetween the real content and the altered contentthat the Trojan returns. This all leads the\ninfected user to trust thatthe car auction and seller are trustworthy and to proceed to buy\nthecar. While the auction looks completely legitimate on the infecteduser's machine, if the\nsame auction is viewed from a non-infectedmachine the difference can be seen\nimmediately.\nFor example, here is a screen shot taken from an infected user's machine:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Click for larger image**\n\nIn this shot the Trojan has silently altered the page returned fromeBay, it shows that the\nseller has a feedback rating of 13, howeverwhen viewed from a non-infected machine the\nseller had a feedback ofjust 1.\n\nSince it was first discovered in March the Trojan has been underfurther development. The\nTrojan can now intercept and alter trafficdestined for sites other than eBay! The ability to\nintercept trafficfor the following sites has been added to the new version of the Trojan:\n\n- www.carfax.com\n\n- www.autocheck.com\n\n- wwwapps.ups.com\n\n- escrow.com\n\n- my.escrow.com\n\n- ecart.escrow.com\n\n- www.escrow.com\n\nThis is very worrying as it shows the lengths that the Bayrob gangwill go to in order to\nconvince infected users that what they areseeing is real. Now even if a (infected) shopper is\nvery cautious anddecides to check the car out at sites outside of eBay (in this\ncasecarfax.com or autocheck.com) they will receive fake results also.\n\nIt is also very interesting to see that traffic for ups.com is alsointercepted; can the Trojan\nalso show fake information about apackages’ delivery status? We have not been able to\nconfirm this as yetbut it would fit with the pattern of this Trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe site escrow.com has also fallen into the crosshairs of thisTrojan. It appears that even if\nthe user wished to pay via the escrowsite so as to protect their money, the gang behind\nTrojan.Bayrob willbe able to detect this and intercept or alter that traffic also.\n\nOf course the Trojan can still intercept traffic destined for the following eBay sites also just\nas it could before:\n\n- my.ebay.com\n\n- cgi.ebay.com\n\n- offer.ebay.com\n\n- feedback.ebay.com\n\n- motors.search.ebay.com\n\n- search.ebay.com\n\n- us.ebayobjects.com\n\n- pages.ebay.com\n\n- pages.motors.ebay.com\n\n- motors.listings.ebay.com\n\n- cgi1.ebay.com\n\nFrom analysis of the sample involved in this case it is clear thatthis was a targeted attack\nagainst a single user. This can be seen dueto the fact that there are specific details related\nto the victimembedded in the executable. This means that every time the gang want toscam\na new victim they create a new, slightly different, Trojan thatcontains the specific details of\nthe new victim. This shows that thegang behind this Trojan are very involved in each\nparticular scam thatis perpetrated.\n\nThe most recent case of the fraud sheds more light on how the scamworks and what\nhappens to the money after the auction has ended. Moneymules in the US are recruited\nbefore the scam takes place so that thevictim will not be suspicious about the destination of\nthe money forthe auction. Most people would be sceptical of sending money to Greecefor a\ncar on sale in the US for example. By using money mules in the USthe scammers avoid\nraising suspicions about the auction until the moneyhas already been delivered to the\nattackers via the mules. I suspectthat the attackers did not collect the money in Greece\nthemselves butrecruited other people to collect these payments also.\nMoney mules normally receive funds to their own bona fide USaccounts then withdraw it in\ncash and send it to the operators of thescam via Western Union (in this case) taking a\npercentage of the amountfor their part. The mules are often recruited in work-from-home\ntypescams – much has already been written on that subject elsewhere.\n\nIn the latest disclosed case the victim realized they had beeninfected by the Trojan when\nthe user posted to the eBay forum stating ascam had occurred. When other eBay users\nchecked the details of the bidthey informed the user that they were seeing different\ninformation ontheir computers than what was being shown on the infected machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the user viewed the bidding history on the infected machine, afake eBay page was\nreturned by the Trojan and this fake page showedthat the user had bid on a Jeep and had\nwon the auction. However, whenthe same page was viewed from an uninfected machine\nthere was no recordof the user's purchase of the Jeep.\n\nThe gang behind this Trojan have shown themselves to be veryorganized and skilled and\nthey possess many different abilities; theyare able to code in php, write Trojans, recruit\nmoney mules, andorganize money drops. This is a sophisticated operation that has\nbecomemore advanced since it was first discovered in March with the additionof other sites,\nsuch as carfax.com, ups.com, and escrow.com.\n\nThe Trojan is currently known to use the following servers:\n\n- wmwbc.com\n\n- vam-ars.com\n\n- cameradealsusa.com\n\n- michelleorea.com\n\nOther servers are also being investigated as being part of the scam. Afirewall should be\nused to deny access to the above addresses. EBayusers that have been affected by\nTrojan.Bayrob are encouraged tocontact eBay and local law enforcement to report the\nscam.\n\n\n-----",
