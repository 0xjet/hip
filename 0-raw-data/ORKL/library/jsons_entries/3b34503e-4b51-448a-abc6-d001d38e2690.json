    "plain_text": "# Newly Found Malware Threatens IoT Devices\n\n**[lifars.com/2022/01/newly-found-malware-threatens-iot-devices/](https://lifars.com/2022/01/newly-found-malware-threatens-iot-devices/)**\n\nJanuary 12, 2022\n\nA new malware has been identified by AT&T Alien Labs that exposed millions of Internet of\nThings devices. The BotenaGo backdoor vulnerability, written in Google’s Golang\nprogramming language, uses the Internet of Things (IoT) with 19412 networking ports or\nassociated modules. The said malware threatens IoT devices and can simultaneously exploit\nup to 30 separate vulnerabilities against its targets.\n\nMercenaries turned to Shodan to ensure that millions of devices were compromised by at\nleast part of the malware’s activities. Shodan is a search engine used for hunting internetconnected devices on the internet. Unfortunately, the number of antivirus solutions capable\nof protecting against infection is far lower. The software is believed to be similar to the Mirai\nbotnet, which was responsible for shutting down internet connectivity for parts of the East\nCoast in 2016.\n\nWhen BotenaGo was found, just six of the 62 vendors that the malware-scanning VirusTotal\nplatform used to identify it as malware detected it as malware. A few recognized BotenaGo\nas malware because it was based on Mirai – a malicious software intended to construct\n\n\n-----\n\nbotnets. Its controllers may launch widespread denial of service attacks against its targets by\ndoing so.\n\nLIFARS Managed Threat Hunting and Response Service (MTH&R) was designed to\nhelp customers uncover adversaries across your Endpoint, Network and SIEM data.\n[Our elite team has decades of combined experience working within their Governmental](https://www.lifars.com/lifars-managed-threat-hunting-and-response-service/)\nCSIRT responding and hunting for adversaries from 100’s of attacks, including\nRansomware and APT’s.\n\n## BotenaGo’s Operational Structures\n\nBotenaGo starts by presenting the total number of infected devices to the hacker’s payload\ninterface, which occurs before injecting shell script files into the host console’s operating\nsystem. The attack surface is then assaulted by employing a function to map the victim’s\ndevice to narrow down the scope of the assault. Each destination is defined in command\nterminal strings to launch malicious malware on the target device. Following that, a request is\nsent to the IoT endpoint to verify that the destination is legitimate. To send the malicious\npayload, the attackers must press the enter key.\n\nBotenaGo looks for potentially susceptible targets during the scanning process as the\nmalware threatens IoT devices. An examination of the code shows that the attacker is\nsupplied with a real-time global infection counter, which indicates the number of affected\ndevices on the network at any particular point in time. From this, the attackers can exploit\nvulnerabilities in internet-facing devices and execute remote shell commands, which\nattackers might utilize as a gateway to the broader network if the device is not adequately\nprotected.\n\nAdditionally, attackers can use this option to spread malicious payloads. However, at the time\nof the researchers’ analysis of BotenaGo, many of these payloads were deleted from the\nservers maintained by the attackers; thus, it was not feasible to analyze them.\n\n## What Vulnerabilities Can Be Compromised With BotenaGo\n\nBotenaGo can hack millions of vulnerable systems. It can go as big as malware that\nthreatens IoT devices. However, according to the researchers, there is no apparent\nconnection with a command and control server at this time. Accordingly, there are three\npossible outcomes to consider. Initially, BotenaGo may be merely a broader malware suite\nmodule that isn’t currently utilized in assaults. Another option is tied to Mirai, which\nindividuals use to target particular computers when launching attacks.\n\nLikewise, experts claim that BotenaGo is still under development and that a beta version was\nmistakenly published early, which explains why it doesn’t seem to be doing anything. Even if\nBotenaGo is not actively exploiting any vulnerabilities, the sheer number of flaws it can\nattack implies that millions of devices are theoretically susceptible.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Methods for Keeping Your Organization Safe From a Potential IoT Attack\n\nYou can avoid any assault and malware that threatens IoT devices by keeping software up to\ndate and applying security upgrades as soon as possible. That will reduce the time for\nattackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities in IoT software. It is also advised that IoT\ndevices not be exposed to the public internet and that a properly configured firewall be\ninstalled to give off better security.\n\n### Keep Firmware And Applications Up To Date\n\nFirmware keeps you secure by installing the most recent security fixes and reducing the\nlikelihood of a cyberattack occurring. You may patch any vulnerabilities or exploits as they\nare discovered and make your IoT devices more secure. If at all feasible, enable the option\nto check for updates automatically.\n\n### Modify The Router’s Default Configuration\n\nThe majority of individuals forget to change their routers and instead use the name provided\nby the manufacturer instead. That might jeopardize the security of a personal Wi-Fi network.\nAny name you like, as long as it is not affiliated with you. Because so many IoT devices are\nlinked to Wi-Fi, the network and Wi-Fi are the first line of defense against hackers when\nsecuring your IoT devices. Make sure that the default privacy and security settings are\nchanged. Those configurations often serve the interests of manufacturers rather than you.\nAvoid online shopping when connected to a public Wi-Fi network since anybody may take\nyour information.\n\n### Stay Away From Universal Plug and Play Devices\n\nEven though Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) has its benefits, it may render printers, routers,\ncameras, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices susceptible to cyber assaults. The\nunderlying premise behind the design of UPnP is to make it simpler for network devices to\ncommunicate with one another without the need for extra setup and to assist them in\nautomatically discovering one another. However, hackers will profit the most from this since\nthey can find all IoT devices outside your local network. As a result, it is recommended that\nUPnP be turned off altogether.\n\n### Have A Complex Password And Do Not Reuse it\n\nIf you are still using the words “password” and “qwerty” as your password, you should\nreconsider your strategy. Using a common and basic password for Internet of Things devices\nis equivalent to opening the door to hackers. Passwords that are both strong and secure are\nthe greatest safeguard against hackers. Make sure to use a different, one-of-a-kind\npassword for each device. If hackers can guess one of your passwords, they might damage\n\n\n-----\n\nevery device you possess that relies upon that password to function correctly. Yes, it may be\nchallenging to remember all passwords, but it is necessary to safeguard Internet of Things\ndevices. You may jot them down in your journal but abstain from storing them on your\ntechnological device.\n\n### Turn Off Any IoT Devices Connected To The Network When Not In Use\n\nYou must be conscious of every feature you require from your Internet of Things device.\nMost modern products, including refrigerators and televisions, can connect to the internet.\nHowever, that does not imply that you must link them to the internet as well. It would help if\nyou scrutinized the characteristics of your devices to determine which gadgets need internet\naccess to work properly.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe bulk of IoT manufacturers send out frequent updates, and you can also check their\nwebsites to see if there are any new security patches or upgrades available. Because IoT\ndevices do not have any additional layers of protection, keeping them up to date regularly is\nessential for their security. Software updates for Internet of Things devices guarantee that\nthe device is equipped with the most recent antimalware and antivirus defenses.\nFurthermore, it assists the system in cleaning up the security weaknesses present in prior\nsoftware versions. Hackers are continually refining their strategies for invading your personal\ninformation. It is preferable to keep software up to date and to be prepared for any external\nthreats.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/att-alien-labs-finds-new-golangmalwarebotenago-targeting-millions-of-routers-and-iot-devices-with-more-than-30-exploits\n\n[https://www.iotworldtoday.com/2021/11/16/botenago-malware-targets-millions-of-iot-devices/](https://www.iotworldtoday.com/2021/11/16/botenago-malware-targets-millions-of-iot-devices/)\n\nhttps://sea.pcmag.com/security/47232/att-reveals-malware-targeting-millions-of-routers-iotdevices\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/this-mysterious-malware-could-threaten-millions-of-routersand-iot-devices/\n\n\n-----",
