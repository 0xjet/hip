In this paper, we shed light on\ntargeted malware attacks faced by these organizations by\nstudying malicious e-mails received by 10 civil society\norganizations (the majority of which are from groups related to China and Tibet issues) over a period of 4 years.\nOur study highlights important properties of malware\nthreats faced by these organizations with implications on\nhow these organizations defend themselves and how we\nquantify these threats. We find that the technical sophistication of malware we observe is fairly low, with more\neffort placed on socially engineering the e-mail content. Based on this observation, we develop the Targeted\nThreat Index (TTI), a metric which incorporates both social engineering and technical sophistication when assessing the risk of malware threats. We demonstrate that\nthis metric is more effective than simple technical sophistication for identifying malware threats with the highest potential to successfully compromise victims. We\nalso discuss how education efforts focused on changing\nuser behaviour can help prevent compromise. For two\nof the three Tibetan groups in our study simple steps\nsuch as avoiding the use of email attachments could\ncut document-based malware threats delivered through\ne-mail that we observed by up to 95%.\n\n#### 1 Introduction\n\nCivil society organizations (CSOs), working on human rights issues around the globe, face a spectrum\nof politically-motivated information security threats that\nseek to deny (e.g. Internet filtering, denial-of-service attacks), manipulate (e.g. website defacements) or monitor (e.g. targeted malware) information related to their\nwork. Targeted malware attacks in particular are an in\n\ncreasing problem for CSOs. These attacks are not isolated incidents, but waves of attacks organized in campaigns that persistently attempt to compromise systems\nand gain access to networks over long periods of time\nwhile remaining undetected. These campaigns are custom designed for specific targets and are conducted by\nhighly motivated attackers. The objective of these campaigns is to extract information from compromised systems and monitor user activity and is best understood as\na form of espionage. CSOs can be particularly susceptible to these threats due to limited resources and lack\nof security awareness. Targeted malware is an active research area, particularly in private industry. However,\nfocused studies on targeted attacks against CSOs are relatively limited despite the persistent threats they face and\nthe vulnerability of these groups.\nIn this study, we work with 10 CSOs for a period of\n4 years to characterize and track targeted malware campaigns against these groups. With the exception of two\ngroups that work on human rights in multiple countries,\nthe remaining eight groups focus on China and Tibetrelated human rights issues. We focus on targeted malware typically delivered via e-mail that is specifically tailored to these groups as opposed to conventional spam\nwhich has been well characterized in numerous previous\nworks [27, 42, 45, 52, 70, 71]. We consider the threats to\nthese groups along two axes: the technical sophistication of the malware as well as sophistication of the social engineering used to deliver the malicious payload.\nWe combine these two metrics to form an overall threat\nranking that we call the Targeted Threat Index (TTI).\nWhile other scoring systems exist for characterizing the\nlevel of severity and danger of a technical vulnerability [7, 17, 41, 50], no common system exists for ranking\nthe sophistication of targeted e-mail attacks. TTI allows\nus to gain insights into the relative sophistication of social engineering and malware leveraged against CSOs.\nA key to the success of our study is a unique methodology, combining qualitative and technical analysis of\n\n\n-----\n\ne-mails and their attachments with fieldwork (e.g. site\nvisits) and interviews with affected CSOs. This methodology, which we describe in more detail in Section 3, allows us to both accurately rate the level of targeting of email messages by interfacing with CSOs participating in\nour study (Section 4.2), and understand the relative technical sophistication of different malware families used in\nthe attacks (Section 4.3). By combining the strengths of\nour qualitative and quantitative analysis, we are able to\naccurately understand trends in terms of social engineering and technical sophistication of politically-motivated\ntargeted malware threats faced by CSOs.\nOur study makes the following observations, which\nhave implications for security strategies that CSOs can\nemploy to protect themselves from targeted malware:\n\n**Attachments are the primary vector for email based**\n**targeted malware.** More than 80% of malware delivered to Tibet-related organizations in our study and submitted to us is contained in an e-mail attachment. Further, for 2 of the 3 Tibetan organizations in our study\n(with at least 40 submitted e-mails), simply not opening\nattachments would mitigate more than 95% of targeted\nmalware threats that use email as a vector.\n\n**Targeted malware technical sophistication is low. So-**\n**cial engineering sophistication is high** We find that\nthe technical sophistication of targeted malware delivered to CSOs in our study is relatively low (e.g., relative to commercial malware that has been found targeting\nCSOs and journalists [35,36,38] and conventional financially motivated malware), with much more effort given\nto socially engineering messages to mislead users. This\nfinding highlights the potential for education efforts focused on changing user behaviours rather than high-cost\ntechnical security solutions to help protect CSOs.\n\n**CSOs face persistent and highly motivated actors.**\nFor numerous malware samples in our study we observe several versions of the software appearing over\nthe course of our four year study. These multiple versions show evidence of technical improvements to complement existing social engineering techniques.\nSince the start of our study we have participated in\na series of workshops with the participating Tibetan organizations to translate these results into a training curriculum. Specifically, we have educated them about how\nto identify suspicious e-mail headers to identify spoofed\nsenders and demonstrated tools that can be used to check\ne-mailed links for malware and drive-by-downloads.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents relevant background on targeted malware\nand attacks on CSOs. Our data collection methodology\nis described in Section 3. We describe our targeting and\ntechnical sophistication metrics as well as how we combine them to produce the Targeted Threat Index (TTI)\n\n\nin Section 4. Training and outreach implications of our\nwork are discussed in Section 5. We present related work\nin Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.\n\n#### 2 Background\n\n 2.1 Targeted Malware Overview\n\nTargeted malware are a category of attacks that are distinct from common spam, phishing, and financially motivated malware. Spam and mass phishing attacks are\nindiscriminate in the selection of targets and are directed\nto the largest number of users possible. Similarly, financially motivated malware such as banking trojans seek\nto compromise as many users as possible to maximize\nthe potential profits that can be made. The social engineering tactics and themes used by these kinds of attacks\nare generic and the attack vectors are sent in high volumes. By contrast targeted malware attacks are designed\nfor specific targets, sent in lower volumes, and are motivated by the objective of stealing specific sensitive data\nfrom a target.\nTargeted malware attacks typically involve the following stages [24,66]:\n\n**Reconnaissance:** During this stage attackers conduct\nresearch on targets including profiling systems, software,\nand information security defenses used to identify possible vulnerabilities and contextual information on personnel and activities to aid social engineering.\n\n**Delivery:** During this stage a vector for delivering\nthe attack is selected. Common vectors include e-mails\nwith malicious documents or links, or contacting targets\nthrough instant messaging services and using social engineering to send malware to them. Typically, a target of\nsuch an attack receives an e-mail, possibly appearing to\nbe from someone they know, containing text that urges\nthe user to open an attached document (or visit a website).\n\n**Compromise: During this stage malicious code is exe-**\ncuted on a target machine typically after a user initiated\naction such as opening a malicious document or link.\n\n**Command and Control: During this stage the infected**\nhost system establishes a communications channel to a\ncommand and control (C&C) server operated by the attackers. Once this channel has been established the attackers can issue commands and download further malware on to the system\n\n**Additional attacker actions:** After a successful compromise is established, attackers can conduct a number of\nactions including ex-filtrating data from the infected host\nand transmitting it back to attackers through a process\nof encrypting, compressing, and transferring to a server\n\n\n-----\n\noperated by the attackers. Attackers may also use peripherals such as webcams and microphones to monitor\nusers in real time. The infected host may also serve as\na starting point to infect other machines on the network\nand seek out specific information or credentials.\n\n#### 2.2 Targeted Malware and CSOs\n\nTargeted malware has become recognized by governments and businesses around the world as a serious political and corporate espionage threat. The United States\ngovernment has been particularly vocal on the threat targeted malware enabled espionage poses. General Keith\nAlexander, current Director of the National Security\nAgency and Commander of United States Cyber Command has stated that the theft of US intellectual property\nthrough cyber espionage constitutes the “greatest transfer\nof wealth in history” [47]. Recent widely publicized targeted malware intrusions against Google, RSA, the New\nYork Times and other high profile targets have raised\npublic awareness around these attacks [20,44,48]\nDespite this increased attention, targeted malware is\nnot a new problem, with over a decade of public reports\non these kinds of attacks [66]. However, the majority\nof research on targeted malware is conducted by private\nsecurity companies who typically focus on campaigns\nagainst industry and government entities. As a result, targeted attacks on civil society and non-governmental organizations have gone underreported despite the fact that\nthese organizations have been shown to be frequently\ntargeted by cyber espionage campaigns. In particular,\ncommunities related to ethnic minority groups in China\nincluding Tibetans, Uyghurs, and religious groups such\nas Falun Gong have been frequent targets of cyber espionage campaigns with reports dating back to at least\n2002 [61].\nIn some cases, the same actors have been revealed to\nbe targeting civil society groups, government and industry entities. A notable example of this was the 2009 report by the Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto, which uncovered the “GhostNet” cyber\nespionage network. GhostNet successfully compromised\nprominent organizations in the Tibetan community in addition to 1,295 hosts in 103 countries, including ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, and news media [25]. The GhostNet case is not\nan isolated example, as other reports have shown CSOs\n(commonly Tibetan organizations) included as targets in\ncampaigns that are also directed to a range of government and industry entities [8,26,28,29,54–56] Some of\nthese reports include technical details on the CSO specific attacks [26, 28, 54, 55] while others note them as a\ntarget but do not address in detail [8,29,56].\nWhile the majority of documented targeted malware\n\n\ncampaigns against CSOs involve China and Tibet-related\ngroups and potentially China-related attack operators\n\n[9–11, 23, 25, 26, 32, 61–65, 67, 68], these kinds of attacks go beyond China. Recent research and news media\nhave reported attacks against large human rights groups\nfocused on multiple issues and countries [31, 46], and\ncommunities related to Syria [18] and Iran [37]. Researchers have also uncovered the use of commercial\nnetwork intrusion products used to target activists from\nBahrain [38], the United Arab Emirates [36], and journalists from Ethiopia [35].\n\n#### 3 Data collection\n\nSince our study involves dealing with e-mail messages\nwhich may contain personally identifiable information\n(PII) and collection of information from CSOs who need\nto maintain privacy of their data, we consulted with our\ninstitutional research ethics board during the design of\nour study. The methods described below have been submitted to and approved by this board.\n\n#### 3.1 Study Participants\n\nWe recruited participants via three main channels: (1)\nan open call on our Web site, (2) outreach to organizations we had prior relationship with and (3) referrals\nfrom participating groups. As part of the study these\ngroups agreed to share technical data (e.g., e-mails with\nsuspicious attachments) and participate in interviews at\nthe onset and end of the study. Their identity and any PII\nshared with us were kept strictly confidential.\nFor the purposes of our study, we focused on organizations with missions concerning the promotion or protection of human rights. For purposes of this study, ”human\nrights” means any or all of the rights enumerated under\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights [60], the In_ternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [58],_\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social and\n_Cultural Rights [59]. We also considered organizations_\non a case by case basis that have a mission that does not\ndirectly implicate human rights, but who may nonetheless be targeted by politically motivated digital attacks\nbecause of work related to human rights issues (e.g., media organizations that report on human rights violations).\nIn total, 10 organizations participated in the study\n(summarized in Table 1). The majority of these groups\nwork on China-related rights issues and five of these organizations focus specifically on Tibetan rights. The high\nrate of participation from China and Tibet-related human\nrights issues is due in part to our previous relationships\nwith these communities and a significant interest and enthusiasm expressed by the groups. In addition to the\nChina and Tibet-related groups, our study also includes\n\n\n-----\n\ntwo groups, Rights Group 1 and 2 that work on multiple\nhuman rights related issues in various countries.\nThe majority of organizations operate from small offices with less than 20 employees. Some organizations\n(China Group 2, Tibet Group 2) have no physical office\nand consist of small virtual teams collaborating remotely,\noften from home offices. Of these groups only two\n(China Group 1, China Group 3) have a dedicated system\nadministrator on staff. Other groups (Tibet Groups 1-5;\nChina Group 2) rely on volunteers or staff with related\ntechnical skills (e.g. Web development) to provide technical support. Rights Group 1 and Rights Group 2 are\nmuch larger organizations relative to the others in our\nsample. Both organizations have over 100 employees,\nmultiple offices, dedicated IT teams, and enterprise level\ncomputing infrastructures.\n\n#### 3.2 Data Sources\n\nWe collect the following pieces of information from the\nparticipant groups in order to understand the malware\nthreats they face:\n\n**User-submitted e-mail messages.** Our primary data\nsource is a collection of e-mails identified by participants\nas suspicious which were forwarded to a dedicated email server administered by our research team. When\navailable these submissions included full headers, file\nattachments and / or links. There are three key limitations to relying on user-submitted e-mails for our analysis. First, we are only able to study e-mails identified\nby participants as suspicious, which may bias our results to only reporting threats that have been flagged by\nusers. Further, individuals may forget to forward e-mails\nin some cases. Relying on self-reporting also creates bias\nbetween groups as individuals at different organizations\nmay have different thresholds for reporting, which creates difficulties in accurately comparing submission rates\nbetween groups. Thus the amount of threat behaviour\nwe see should be considered a lower bound on what occurs in practice. Second, having participants forward us\ne-mails does not allow us to verify if the targeted organization was successfully compromised by the attack (e.g.,\nif another member of the organization open and executed\nmalware on their machine) and what the scope of the attack was. Finally, e-mail is only one vector that may be\nused to target organizations. Other vectors include waterhole attacks [21], denial of service attacks, or any other\nvectors (e.g., physical threats like infected USB sticks).\nThese limitations mean that it is possible that we did not\ncomprehensively observe all attacks experienced by our\nstudy groups and some more advanced attacks may have\ngone unreported.\nRecognizing the limitations of e-mail submissions, we\ncomplement user submitted emails with data from Net\n\nTable 2: Breakdown of e-mails submitted per group.\n\nOrganization Code # of e-mails\nChina Group 1 53\nChina Group 2 18\nChina Group 3 58\nRights Group 1 28\nRights Group 2 2\nTibet Group 1 365\nTibet Group 2 177\nTibet Group 3 2\nTibet Group 4 97\nTibet Group 5 4\n\nwork Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) alerts, website monitoring, and interviews. Also, upon request of\nstudy groups who were concerned of possible infection\nwe analyzed packet capture data from suspect machines.\nThrough the course of this supplementary analysis we\ndid not find indications of malware compromise that\nused samples that were not included in our pool of usersubmitted emails. In this paper we focus on reporting\nresults from analyzing the user submitted emails through\nthe TTI. The NIDS and website monitoring components\nwere added later in our study and do not significantly\ncontribute to TTI analysis. [1]\n\n#### 3.3 Overview of User-Submitted E-mails\n\nThe e-mails examined in this study span over four years,\nfrom October 14, 2009 to December 31, 2013. Data collection began on November 28, 2011, but China Group\n3 and Tibet Group 1 forwarded us their pre-existing\narchives of suspicious emails, resulting in e-mail samples dating back to October 14, 2009. In total, we received 817 e-mails from the 10 groups participating in\nour study. Table 2 breaks down the submissions from\neach groups and illustrates that submissions were highly\nnon-uniform across the groups. Thus, in general, we focus on the groups with at least 50 e-mail submissions for\nour analysis.\nFigure 1 shows the cumulative number of e-mail submissions per month over the course of the study. For\nexample, China Group 3 shared a set of e-mails received\nin 2010 by a highly targeted member of the organization,\nwhich can be observed in Figure 1. Tibet Group 1 accounts for the highest number of submissions relative to\nthe other groups due to being one of the first groups in\nthe study and being persistently targeted by politically\nmotivated malware. Tibetan Groups 2 and 4, who joined\nthe study later (in April 2012) show a similar submission\nrate to original Tibetan Group 1, suggesting these groups\nare targeted at a similar rate. In Section 4.2, we investi\n|Organization Code|# of e-mails|\n|---|---|\n|China Group 1 China Group 2 China Group 3 Rights Group 1 Rights Group 2 Tibet Group 1 Tibet Group 2 Tibet Group 3 Tibet Group 4 Tibet Group 5|53 18 58 28 2 365 177 2 97 4|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Table 1: Summary of groups participating in our study.|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Organization Code|Description|Organization size|\n|China Group 1 China Group 2 China Group 3 Rights Group 1 Rights Group 2 Tibet Group 1 Tibet Group 2 Tibet Group 3 Tibet Group 4 Tibet Group 5|Human rights organization focused on rights and social justice issues related to China Independent news organization reporting on China Human rights organization focused on rights and social justice issues related to China Human rights organization focused on multiple issues and countries Human rights organization focused on multiple issues and countries Human rights organization focused on Tibet Human rights organization focused on Tibet Independent news organization reporting on Tibet Human rights organization focused on Tibet Human rights organization focused on Tibet|Small (1-20 employees) Small (1-20 employees) Small (1-20 employees) Large (over 100 employees) Large (over 100 employees) Small (1-20 employees) Small (1-20 employees) Small (1-20 employees) Small (1-20 employees) Small (1-20 employees)|\n\n\nLink to malware�\nLink to phishing page�\nMalware attachment�\n\n\nFigure 1: Cumulative number of messages per group\nover the course of our study for groups that submitted\nat least 50 e-mail messages.\n\ngate commonalities in targeting of these groups.\nWe further classify e-mails as malicious if they include\nattached malware, a direct link to malware or a site with\na drive-by download, or a link to a phishing page. Figure 2 shows the amount of e-mails of each type for the\ngroups that submitted at least 25 e-mails to our system.\nThe most common approach employed in these e-mails\nwas attaching a malicious payload to the e-mail itself.\nHowever, we notice a higher rate of phishing attacks on\nthe China-related groups and the rights groups working\non multiple international human rights issues. In particular, 46% of the e-mails submitted by China Group 1,\nand 50% of the e-mails submitted by Rights Group 1, direct the user to a phishing Web site. In the case of China\nGroup 1, this large proportion of phishing sites is observed because this group configured their spam filter to\nforward e-mails to our system, resulting in us receiving\na large number of generic, non-targeted spam. In contrast, the phishing observed for Rights Group 1, while\nlow in volume (13 out of 26 messages) is targeted. We\ndelve more into how we rate the targeting of e-mails in\nSection 4.2.\nThe rate of submissions to our project meant that it\n\n\nFigure 2: Breakdown of malicious e-mails based on\nwhether they deliver malware as an attachment, refer the\nuse to a link with a malicious file, or attempt to phish\ndata from the user.\n\nwas feasible to manually analyze e-mail attachments for\nmalware as they were submitted. This analysis gives us\nhigher confidence in our results because AV signatures\nare frequently unable to detect new or modified threats,\nand can overlook the presence of a malicious payload\nthat can be easily identified upon manual inspection (e.g.\nshellcode in an RTF exploit). In total, we analyzed 3,617\npayload files and found 2,814 (78%) of them to be malicious. Section 4.3 describes our analysis methodology\nin more detail.\n\n#### 4 Targeted Threat Index\n\nOur dataset includes a wide range of targeted malware\nthreats varying in level of both social engineering and\ntechnical complexity. This range presents a challenge\nin ranking the relative sophistication of the malware and\ntargeting tactics used by attackers.\nWhile scoring systems such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System [17] exist for the purpose of communicating the level of severity and danger of a vulnerability, there is no standardized system for ranking\n\n\n-----\n\nthe sophistication of targeted email attacks. This gap is\nlikely because evaluating the sophistication of the targeting is non-technical, and cannot be automated due to the\nrequirement of a strong familiarity with the underlying\nsubject material.\nTo address this gap we developed the Targeted Threat\nIndex (TTI) to assign a ranking score to the targeted malicious emails in our dataset. The TTI score is intended\nfor use in prioritizing the analysis of incoming threats,\nas well as for getting an overall idea of how severely an\norganization is threatened.\nThe TTI score is calculated by taking a base value determined by the sophistication of the targeting method,\nwhich is then multiplied by a value for the technical\nsophistication of the malware. The base score can be\nused independently to compare emails, and the combined\nscore gives an indication of the level of effort an attacker\nhas put into individual threats.\n\n#### 4.1 TTI Metric\n\nThe TTI score is calculated in two parts:\n\n(Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value)\n(Technical Sophistication Multiplier) = TTI Score\n_×_\n\nTTI scores range from 1 to 10, where 10 is the most\nsophisticated attack. Scores of 0 are reserved for threats\nthat are not targeted, even if they are malicious. For\nexample, spam using an attached PDF or XLS to bypass anti-spam filters, and highly sophisticated financially motivated malware, would both score 0.\nThis section overviews how we compute the Social\n_Engineering Sophistication Base Value (Section 4.2) and_\nthe Technical Sophistication Multiplier (Section 4.3). In\nSection 4.4, we present the results of computing and analyzing the TTI value of threats observed by the organizations in our study. We also discuss implications and\nlimitations of the metric.\n\n#### 4.2 Social Engineering Tactics\n\nWe leverage a manual coding approach to measure the\nsophistication of social engineering tactics used in the attacks observed by the organizations in our study. While\nautomated approaches may be explored in the future, this\nmanual analysis allows us to have high confidence in our\nresults, especially since understanding the social engineering often required contextual information provided\nby the organizations in our study. To quantify the level\nof sophistication, we manually analyse the e-mail subject\nline, body, attachments and header fields. We perform an\ninitial content analysis by coding the e-mails based on\n\n\ntheir semantic content, and then use these results to generate a numerical metric quantifying the level of targeting\nused.\n\n**4.2.1** **Content coding and analysis results**\n\nWe code the e-mails based on their subject line, body, attachments and headers using the following methodology:\n\n**Subject line, body, and attachments.** The content of\nthe subject line, body and attachments for each submitted\ne-mail were content coded into 8 themes, each containing categories for specific instances of the theme: Country / Region (referring to a specific geographical country\nor region); Ethnic Groups (referring to a specific ethnic\ngroup); Event (referring to a specific event); Organizations (referring to specific organizations); People (referring to specific persons), Political (reference to specific\npolitical issues), Technology (reference to technical support), Miscellaneous (content without clear context or\ncategories that do not fall into one of the other themes).\nTable 3 summarizes the themes and provides examples\nof categories within each theme.\n\n**E-mail headers.** The header of each e-mail was analyzed to determine if the sending e-mail address was\nspoofed or the e-mail address was otherwise designed\nto appear to come from a real person and / or organization (e.g. by registering an e-mail account that resembles\na person and / or organization’s name from a free mail\nprovider). We divide the results based on whether they\nattempted to spoof an organization or a specific person.\nUsing this manual analysis, we perform a content analysis of e-mails submitted by the organizations. Results\nof this analysis confirm that social engineering is an important tool in the arsenal of adversaries who aim to deliver targeted malware. Specifically, 95% and 97% of\ne-mails to Chinese and Tibetan groups, respectively, included reference to relevant regional issues. Spoofing\nof specific senders and organizations was also prevalent\nwith 52% of e-mails to Tibetan groups designed to appear to come from real organizations, often from within\nthe Tibetan community. For example, a common target of spoofing was the Central Tibetan Administration\n(CTA), referenced in 21% of the spoofed e-mails, which\nadministers programs for Tibetan refugees living in India and advocates for human rights in Tibet. While the\nnumber of e-mail submissions were lower for the general human rights groups, we observe similar trends there\nwith 92% of e-mails submitted by Rights Group 1 appearing to come from individuals in the group (as a result\nof spoofing).\nIn some cases we even observed the same attackers\ntargeting multiple CSOs with customized e-mail lures.\nFor example, we tracked a campaign that targeted China\nGroups 1 and 2, and Tibet Group 1 with a remote access\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3: Overview of themes and categories within the themes for grouping targeted e-mail messages.\nTheme Total Categories Example Categories\nCountry/Region 26 China, US, European Union\nEthnic Groups 2 Tibetan, Uyghur\nEvent 31 self immolation, Communist Party of China, 18th National Party Congress\nOrganizations 32 United Nations, Central Tibetan Administration\nPeople 31 His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Hu Jintao\nPolitical 6 human rights, terrorism\nTechnology 5 software updates, virtual private servers\nMiscellaneous 1 content without clear context which falls outside of the other themes\n\n|Theme|Total Categories|Example Categories|\n|---|---|---|\n|Country/Region Ethnic Groups Event Organizations People Political Technology Miscellaneous|26 2 31 32 31 6 5 1|China, US, European Union Tibetan, Uyghur self immolation, Communist Party of China, 18th National Party Congress United Nations, Central Tibetan Administration His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Hu Jintao human rights, terrorism software updates, virtual private servers content without clear context which falls outside of the other themes|\n\n\ntrojan we call IEXPL0RE [22] China Group 1 received\nthe malware in e-mails claiming to be from personal\nfriends whereas China Group 2 received the malware in\nan e-mail containing a story about a high-rise apartment\nbuilding fire in China. In contrast, Tibet Group 1 received the malware embedded into a video of a speech\nby the Dalai Lama, attached to an e-mail about a year in\nreview of Tibetan human rights issues.\n\n**4.2.2** **Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value**\n\nWhile the content analysis results clearly show attacks\ntailored to the interests of targeted groups, content coding alone does not give a relative score of the sophistication used in the attacks. We now describe how we assign\nthe “social engineering sophistication base value” to emails based on their level of social engineering.\nTo measure the targeting sophistication we assign a\nscore that ranges from 0-5 that rates the social engineering techniques used to get the victim to open the attachment. This score considers the content and presentation\nof the e-mail message as well as the claimed sender identity. This determination also includes the content of any\nassociated files, as malware is often implanted into legitimate relevant documents to evade suspicion from users\nwhen the malicious documents are opened.\nThe Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value is\nassigned based on the following criteria:\n**0 Not Targeted: Recipient does not appear to be a spe-**\ncific target. Content is not relevant to the recipient. The\ne-mail is likely spam or a non-targeted phishing attempt.\n**1 Targeted Not Customized:** Recipient is a specific\ntarget. Content is not relevant to the recipient or contains\ninformation that is obviously false with little to no validation required by the recipient. The e-mail header and/or\nsignature do not reference a real person or organization.\n**2 Targeted Poorly Customized: Recipient is a specific**\ntarget. Content is generally relevant to the target but has\nattributes that make it appear questionable (e.g. incomplete text, poor spelling and grammar, incorrect addressing). The e-mail header and / or signature may reference\na real person or organization.\n\n\n**3 Targeted Customized: Recipient is a specific target.**\nContent is relevant to the target and may repurpose legitimate information (such as a news article, press release,\nconference or event website) and can be externally verified (e.g. message references information that can be\nfound on a website). Or, the e-mail text appears to repurpose legitimate e-mail messages that may have been\ncollected from public mailing lists or from compromised\naccounts. The e-mail header and / or signature references\na real person or organization.\n\n**4 Targeted Personalized: Recipient is a specific target.**\nThe e-mail message is personalized for the recipient or\ntarget organization (e.g. specifically addressed or referring to individual and / or organization by name). Content is relevant to the target and may repurpose legitimate\ninformation that can be externally verified or appears to\nrepurpose legitimate messages. The e-mail header and /\nor signature references a real person or organization.\n\n**5 Targeted Highly Personalized:** Recipient is a specific target. The e-mail message is individually personalized and customized for the recipient and references\nconfidential / sensitive information that is directly relevant to the target (e.g. internal meeting minutes, compromised communications from the organization). The\ne-mail header and / or signature references a real person\nor organization.\n\nContent coding of emails and determinations of social engineering ratings for the TTI were performed by\nfive independent coders who were given a code book for\ncontent categories and the TTI social engineering scale\nwith examples to guide analysis. We performed regular inter-rater reliability checks and flagged any potential edge cases and inconsistencies for discussion and reevaluation. Following completion of this analysis, two\nof the authors reviewed the social engineering base value\nscores to ensure consistency and conformity to the scale.\nWe provide specific examples of each of these targeting\nvalues in Appendix A.\n\n\n-----\n\nTibet Group 2�\nTibet Group 4�\n\n\nFigure 3: Social engineering sophistication base value\nassigned to e-mail submissions from groups that submitted at least 50 e-mails.\n\n**4.2.3** **Summary of Social Engineering Sophistica-**\n**tion Base Value**\n\nFigure 3 shows the targeting score for organizations in\nour study who submitted at least 50 e-mails. We can see\nthat actors targeting these groups put significant effort\ninto targeting their messages, in particular the three Tibetan groups included in Figure 3 observe more than half\nof their messages with a targeting score of 3 or higher.\nThis result means adversaries are taking care to make the\ne-mail appear to come from a legitimate individual or organization, and include relevant information (e.g., news\nreports or exchanges from public mailing lists). Higher\ntargeting scores, which result from actions such as personalizing lures to an individual in the group, or including information that requires prior reconnaissance tend\nto be more rare, but we do observe instances of them.\nFor example, in the case of China Group 3, we observed\nan e-mail which received a social engineering score of 5,\nwhich claimed to be from the group’s funder and referenced a specific meeting they had planned that was not\npublic knowledge.\n\n#### 4.3 Technical Sophistication\n\nWe manually analyzed all submitted emails and attachments to determine whether they contained politicallymotivated malware. The malware is then analyzed in detail to extract information such as the vulnerability, C&C\nserver (if present), and technical sophistication of the exploit.\n\n**4.3.1** **Assessment methodology**\n\nThe first step in our analysis pipeline is determining\nwhether the email contains politically motivated malware\nor not. This process involves an initial inspection for\nsocial engineering of the email message and attachment\n(e.g., an executable pretending to be a document). We\nalso correlate with other emails received as part of this\nproject to identify already-known malware. Well-known\n\n\nmalware attacks (e.g., the Zeus trojan masquerading as\nan email from the ACH credit card payment processor,\nor Bredolab malware pretending to be from the DHL\ncourier service) are not considered targeted attacks in our\nstudy, but are still kept for potential review.\nOnce we have identified emails which we suspect of\ncontaining politically-motivated malware, we perform\nthe following analysis steps on any attachments to verify that they indeed contain malware. First, we run the\nattachment in a sandboxed VM to look for malicious activity e.g., an Office document writing files to disk or trying to connect to a C&C server. We also check the MD5\nhash of the attachment against the Virus Total database to\nsee if it matches existing viruses. We also manually examine the attached file for signs of malicious intent (e.g.,\nexecutable payload in a PDF, shellcode or Javascript).\nWe exclude any graphics attached to the email which are\nused for social engineering (and do not contain malicious\npayload) from our analysis.\nWe follow this initial analysis with more detailed technical analysis of the attachments which we confirm contain malware. First, we manually verify the file type of\nthe attachment for overview statistics. This manual analysis is necessary as the Unix file command may be misled by methods of manipulating important bytes in the\nfile (e.g., replacing rtf1 with rtf[null]). We then iden_\\_ _\\_\ntify if the vulnerability included in the malware already\nexists in a corpus of vulnerabilities, such as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming system. We also perform analysis of network traffic from\nthe attachment to identify the C&C server the malware\nattempts to contact. In cases where the malware does\nnot execute in our controlled environment we manually\nexamine the file to extract the relevant information.\nOn a case-by-case basis we use additional tools such\nas IDA [1] and OllyDbg [3] for detailed static and dynamic analysis, respectively. Our goal in this analysis\nis to identify relationships between malware campaigns\nbetween organizations, or instances of the same malware\nfamily repeatedly targeting a given organization. By observing overlapping C&C servers, or mapping malware\nto common exploits identified by anti virus/security companies we can cluster attacks that we believe come from\nthe same malware family and potentially the same adversary.\n\n**4.3.2** **Technical Sophistication Multiplier**\n\nWhile the previous analysis is useful for understanding\nthe nature of threats, we also score threats numerically to\naid in understanding the relative technical sophistication\nof their approaches. Each malware sample is assigned\none of the following values:\n\n**1 Not Protected - The sample contains no code protec-**\n\n\nTibet Group 2�\nTibet Group 4�\n\n\n-----\n\ntion such as packing, obfuscation (e.g. simple rotation\nof interesting or identifying strings), or anti-reversing\ntricks.\n\n**1.25 Minor Protection -** The sample contains a simple method of protection, such as one of the following:\ncode protection using publicly available tools where the\nreverse method is available, such as UPX packing; simple anti-reversing techniques such as not using import\ntables, or a call to IsDebuggerPresent(); self-disabling in\nthe presence of AV software.\n\n**1.5 Multiple Minor Protection Techniques - The sam-**\nple contains multiple distinct minor code protection techniques (anti-reversing tricks, packing, VM / reversing\ntools detection) that require some low-level knowledge.\nThis level includes malware where code that contains the\ncore functionality of the program is decrypted only in\nmemory.\n\n**1.75 Advanced Protection -** The sample contains minor code protection techniques along with at least one\nadvanced protection method such as rootkit functionality\nor a custom virtualized packer.\n\n**2 Multiple Advanced Protection Techniques -** The\nsample contains multiple distinct advanced protection\ntechniques, e.g. rootkit capability, virtualized packer,\nmultiple anti-reversing techniques, and is clearly designed by a professional software engineering team.\nThe purpose of the technical sophistication multiplier\nis to measure how well the payload of the malware can\nconceal its presence on a compromised machine. We use\na multiplier because advanced malware requires significantly more time and effort (or money, in the case of\ncommercial solutions) to customize for a particular target.\nWe focus on the level of obfuscation used to hide program functionality and avoid detection for the following reasons: (1) It allows the compromised system to\nremain infected for a longer period; (2) it hinders analysts from dissecting a sample and developing instructions to detect the malware and disinfect a compromised\nsystem; (3) since most common used remote access trojans (RATs) have the same core functionality (e.g. keylogging, running commands, exfiltrating data, controlling microphones and webcams, etc.) the level of obfuscation used to conceal what the malware is doing can\nbe used to distinguish one RAT from another.\n\n**4.3.3** **Summary of Technical Sophistication Multi-**\n**plier Value**\n\nFigure 4 shows the technical sophistication multiplier\nvalues for e-mails submitted by the different organizations in our study. One key observation we make here\nis that the email-based targeted malware that was self\n\nChina Group 1\n\nChina Group 3\n\nTibet Group 1\n\n\nTibet Group 2\n\nTibet Group 4\n\n\nFigure 4: Technical sophistication multiplier assigned to\ne-mail submissions from groups that submitted at least\n50 e-mails.\n\nreported by our study groups is relatively simple. The\nhighest multiplier value we see is 1.5 and even that value\nis seen infrequently. The majority of malware observed\nis rated either 1 or 1.25 according to our technical scoring\ncriteria, with Tibetan Groups observing a higher fraction\nof malware rated 1.25 and Chinese groups observing a\nhigher fraction rated 1.\nThe technical sophistication multiplier value is also\nuseful for assessing the technical evolution of threats in\nour study. When we group malware into different family groups we can see some of these groups are under\nactive development. For example, we observe multiple\nversions of the Enfal [40, 49], Mongal [14], and Gh0st\nRAT [15] families with increasing levels of sophistication and defenses in place to protect the malware code\n(resulting in an increase in technical multiplier from 1 to\n1.25 for these families). Since our technical multiplier\nvalue focuses on how well malware code defends and\ndisguises itself, changes to other aspects of the code may\nnot result in an increase in value (e.g., we observe multiple versions of the IMuler.A/Revir.A malware which all\nreceive a score of 1). Interestingly, when we observe both\na Windows and Mac version of a given malware family,\nthe technical score for the Mac version tended to be lower\nwith the Mac version being relatively primitive relative to\nthe Windows variant.\n\n#### 4.4 TTI Results\n\nWe now show how the TTI metric can help us better characterize the relative threat posed by targeted malware.\nFigure 5 shows the technical sophistication multiplier\nand maximum/minimum TTI scores for malware families observed in our dataset. Since we primarily observe\nsimple malware, with a technical sophistication multiplier of 1 or 1.25, this value does a poor job of differentiating the threat posed by the different malware families\nto the CSOs. However, by incorporating both the technical sophistication and targeting base value into the TTI\nmetric we can gain more insights into how effective these\n\n\nChina Group 3\n\nTibet Group 1\n\nTibet Group 2\n\nTibet Group 4\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of the maximum and minimum\nTTI score and technical sophistication multiplied for\nmalware families observed in our data (sorted in decreasing order of maximum TTI).\n\nthreats may be in practice.\nThe impact of using TTI is especially apparent when\ntrying to gain insights into the targeted malware that\nposes the biggest risk to CSOs. Table 4 shows the top\n5 malware families we observe in terms of technical sophistication and in terms of TTI score. If we consider the\nmalware families with the highest technical sophistication, we can see that their TTI values are relatively low,\nwith maximums ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. These tend to be\nmalware families that are familiar to researchers. In particular, PlugX and PoisonIvy have been used in targeted\nattacks together [43] and PlugX is still actively used and\nunder constant development [16]. Despite technical sophistication, the social engineering lures of these threats\nare not well crafted and pose less of a risk to the CSOs\nwhose members may be able to identify and avoid these\nthreats.\nIn contrast, the top 5 malware families in terms of\nTTI have lower technical sophistication (1.25) but much\nhigher levels of social engineering. It is no surprise that\nthreats which score the highest TTI use well known malware that have been extensively documented in attacks\nagainst a variety of targets. For example, the TTI scores\nreflect that Gh0st RAT continues to be seen in higher\nrisk attacks due to its popularity amongst attackers even\nthough it is an older and not particularly advanced tool.\nSince there is no direct connection between the technical\nsophistication of threats and the level of social engineering used to target CSOs, it is likely that different threat\nactors, with a different focus, are at work here. Indeed,\nGh0st RAT was discovered by the Citizen Lab in their\nanalysis of GhostNet [25] and IEXPL0RE RAT was discovered and named for the first time in our work.\nAnother observation is that commercial malware such\nas FinFisher and DaVinci RCS, while being of much\nhigher technical sophistication (relative to the samples in\n\n\nTable 4: Top malware families in our data set in terms of\ntechnical sophistication multiplier and in terms of final\nTTI score.\n\n**Technical Sophistication**\nFamily TTI Tech.

For example, analyzing a FinFisher\nsample targeted against Bahraini activists [38] with the\nTTI, produces an overall TTI score that is dependent on\nthe social targeting aspect, even though the malware is\nvery technically advanced. In this case, the FinFisher attack scores 4.0 on the TTI (base targeting score of 2 with\na technical multiplier of 2). Although the email used\nin the attack references the name and organization of a\nreal journalist, the content is poorly customized, and has\nattributes that look questionable. However, the technical sophistication of the malware is advanced earning it\na score of 2 due to multiple advanced protection techniques, including a custom-written virtualized packer,\nMBR modification, and rootkit functionality. The sample\nalso uses multiple minor forms of protection, including\nat least half a dozen anti-debugging tricks. Even though\nthe technical multiplier is the maximum value, the overall TTI score is only 4.0 due to the low targeting base\nvalue. FinFisher is only effective if it is surreptitiously\ninstalled on a users’ computer. If the malware is delivered through an email attachment, infection is only successful if the user opens the malicious file. The advanced\nnature of this malware will cause the overall score to increase quickly with improved targeting, but as it still requires user intervention, this threat scores lower overall\nthan attacks with highly targeted social engineering using less sophisticated malware.\n\nSimilar findings can also be observed in attacks using\nDaVinci RCS developed by Italy-based company Hacking Team against activists and independent media groups\nfrom the United Arab Emirates and Morocco [36]. While\nthe malware used in these publicly reported attacks is\n\n|Technical Sophistication|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Family|TTI|Tech.

For example, the majority of malware submitted by our study\ngroups appear to be from adversaries that have in-house\nmalware development capabilities and the capacity to\norganize and implement targeted malware campaigns.\nThese adversaries are spending significant effort on social engineering, but generally do not use technically\nadvanced malware. Conversely, the adversaries using\nFinFisher and DaVinci RCS have bought these products\nrather than develop malware themselves. However, while\nthe FinFisher and RCS samples are technically sophisticated pieces of malware, the attacks we analyzed are not\nsophisticated in terms of social engineering tactics.\n\n#### 4.5 Limitations of TTI\n\nWhile the Targeted Threat Index gives insight into the\ndistribution of how sophisticated threats are, we are still\nin the process of evaluating and refining it through interactions with the groups in our study and inclusion of\nmore sophisticated threats observed in related investigations in our lab. Average TTI scores in our dataset may\nbe skewed due to the self-reporting method we use in the\nstudy. Very good threats are less likely to be noticed and\nreported while being sent to far fewer people, and lowquality emails are much more likely to be sent in bulk\nand stand out. It is also possible that individuals in different groups may be more diligent in submitting samples,\nwhich could affect between group comparisons. We are\nmore interested, however, in worst-case (highest) scores\nand not in comparing the average threat severity between\norganizations.\nFinally, this metric is calculated based on the technical\nsophistication of the payload, not on the specific exploit.\nThere is currently no method to modify the TTI score in\na way similar to the temporal metrics used by the CVSS\nmetric. A temporal metric could be added to increase\nthe final TTI value for 0-day vulnerabilities, or possibly\nto reduce the score for exploits that are easily detectable\ndue to a public and well-known generation script, e.g.\nMetasploit [2].\n\n#### 5 Implications\n\nOur study primarily focuses on threats that groups working on human rights issues related to Tibet or China are\ncurrently facing. While our dataset is concentrated on\nthese types of groups, our results have implications for\n\n\nhow CSOs can protect themselves against email-based\ntargeted malware.\nSpecifically, we find that moving towards cloud-based\nplatforms (e.g., Google Docs) instead of relying on email attachments would prevent more than 95% of the\ne-mail malware seen by 2 out of 3 Tibetan groups that\nhad more than 50 e-mail submissions.\nFurther, our results highlight the potential for lowercost user education initiatives to guard against sophisticated social engineering attacks, rather than high cost\ntechnical solutions. This observation stems from the fact\nthat much of the malware we observe is not technically\nsophisticated, but rather relies on social engineering to\ndeliver its payload by convincing users to open malicious\nattachments or links. Other studies [35,36,38] that have\nrevealed the use of commercial malware products against\nCSOs and journalists have shown that many of these\ncases also rely on duping users into opening malicious\ne-mail attachments or social engineered instant messaging conversations. These incidents show that even advanced targeted malware requires successful exploitation\nof users through social engineering tactics.\nUser education can be a powerful tool against the\nkinds of targeted attacks we observed in this study. Indeed, the Tibetan community has taken an active approach with campaigns that urge Tibetan users to not\nsend or open attachments and suggests alternative cloud\nbased options such as Google Docs and Dropbox for\nsharing documents [53]. We have also engaged the Tibetan groups in a series of workshops to introduce training curriculum which draws on examples submitted by\norganizations participating in our study. We have also\nprovided them with technical background to identify suspicious e-mail headers and how to use free services to\ncheck the validity of suspicious links in e-mail messages.\nThe mitigation strategies presented here are focused\non email vectors and do not consider all of the possible\nattacks these groups may face. We highlight these strategies in particular because the majority of groups in our\nstudy identified document-based targeted malware as a\nhigh priority information security concern. The adversaries behind these attacks are highly motivated and will\nlikely adapt their tactics as users change their behaviors.\nFor example, it is plausible that if every user in a particular community began to avoid opening attachments and\ndocument-based malware infected fewer targets, attackers may move on to vectors such as waterhole attacks or\nattacks on cloud document platforms to fill the gap. User\neducation and awareness raising activities need to be ongoing efforts that are informed by current research on the\nstate of threats particular communities are experiencing.\nEvaluation of the effectiveness of user education efforts\nin at risk communities and corresponding reactions from\nattackers is required to understand the dynamics between\n\n\n-----\n\nthese processes.\n\n#### 6 Related Work\n\nThere is a wide body of literature on filtering and detection methods for spam [27,42,45,52,70,71] and phishing\nemails and websites [12, 34, 39, 69]. Attention has also\nbeen given to evaluating user behavior around phishing\nattacks and techniques for evading them [6, 30, 33]. By\ncomparison research on detecting email vectors used for\ntargeted malware attacks is limited. A notable exception is [4, 5], which uses threat and recipient features\nwith a random forest classifier to detect targeted malicious emails in a dataset from a large Fortune 500 company. Other work has focused on imporoving detection\nof documents (e.g. PDF, Microsoft Office) with embedded malicious code [13,51,57]\nAnother area of research explores methods for modeling the stages of targeted attacks and using these models to develop defenses. Guira and Wang [19] propose\na conceptual attack model called the attack pyramid to\nmodel targeted attacks and identify features that can be\ndetected at the various stages. Hutchins, Cloppert and\nAmin, [24] use a kill chain model to track targeted attack campaigns and inform defensive strategies.\nMetrics have been developed to characterize security\nvulnerabilities and their severity [7, 41, 50]. The industry standard is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [17], which uses three metric groups for\ncharacterizing vulnerabilities and their impacts. These\ngroups are: base metric group (the intrinsic and fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and user environments), temporal metric\ngroup (characteristics of a vulnerability that change over\ntime but not among user environments) and environmental metric group (characteristics of a vulnerability that\nare relevant and unique to a particular user’s environment). The CVSS is a widely adopted metric, but only\nrates technical vulnerabilities. Targeted attacks rely on a\nuser action of opening a malicious attachment or visiting\na malicious link to successfully compromise a system.\nTherefore, the sophistication of message lures and other\nsocial engineering tactics are an important part of determining the severity of a targeted attack. Systems like the\nCVSS cannot address this contextual component.\nOur study makes the following contributions to the\nliterature. Previous studies of targeted attacks against\nCSOs usually focus on particular incidents or campaigns\nand do not include longitudinal observations of attacks\nagainst a range of CSO targets. While standards exist\nfor rating the sophistication of technical vulnerabilities\nand research has been done on detecting targeted malware attacks and modeling campaigns, there is no scoring system that considers both the sophistication of mal\n\nware and social engineering tactics used in targeted malware attacks. We address this gap through development\nof the TTI and validate the metric against four years of\ndata collected from 10 CSOs.\n\n#### 7 Conclusions\n\nOur study provides an in-depth look at targeted malware\nthreats faced by CSOs. We find that considering the\ntechnical sophistication of these threats alone is insufficient and that educating users about social engineering tactics used by adversaries can be a powerful tool\nfor improving the security of these organizations. Our\nresults point to simple steps groups can take to protect\nthemselves from document-based targeted malware such\nas shifting to cloud-based document platforms instead\nof relying on attachments which can contain exploits.\nFurther research is needed to measure the effectiveness\nof education strategies for changing user behaviour and\nhow effective these efforts are in mitigation of documentbased malware for CSOs. Further work is also required\nin monitoring how attackers adapt tactics in response to\nobserved behavioural changes in targeted communities.\nIn ongoing work we are continuing our collection of emails and NIDS alerts as well as monitoring other attacks\nagainst these groups (e.g., waterhole attacks and DoS attacks) to understand how threats vary based on their delivery mechanism. We are also working to extend our\nmethodology to more diverse CSO communities such as\nthose in Latin America, Africa, and other underreported\nregions to better document the politically motivated digital threats they may be experiencing.\n\n#### Acknowlegements\n\nThis work was supported by the John D. and Catherine T.\nMacArthur Foundation.

The e-**\nmail in Figure 6 was sent to Tibet group 1. The message\ncontent and sender are vague and do not relate to the interest of the group. The attachment is a word document\nimplanted with malware. The lack of relevant information in this message gives it a score of 1 (targeted, not\ncustomized).\n\n**Targeting Score 2 (Targeted, Poorly Customized).**\nThe e-mail in Figure 7 was sent to Tibet group 1. It references Tibetan self-immolations which is an issue of interest to the group. However, the sender does not appear to\nbe from a real person or organization. The message content is terse and does not referenced information that can\nbe externally validated. Therefore this message scores a\n2 (targeted, poorly customized).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 3\n\n**Targeting Score 3 (Targeted Customized).** The email in Figure 8 was sent to Tibet group 2. On the surface it appears to be a professional e-mail from “Palden\nSangpo” a consultant at the Tibet Career Centre. The\ne-mail sender address and signature reference accurate\ncontact details that can be easily verified through an Internet search. However, the e-mail headers reveal the\npurported e-mail sender address is fraudulent and the\nactual sender was albano_kuqo@gmx.com. The e-mail\ngenerally addresses the organization rather than the individual recipient. Therefore this message scores a 3 (targeted, customized).\n\n**Targeting Score 4 (Targeted Personalized).** The email in Figure 9 was sent to Tibet group 1. It is directly\naddressed to the director of the group and appears to\ncome from Mr. Cheng Li, a prominent China scholar\nbased at the Brookings Institute. The e-mail address\nis made to appear to be from Mr. Cheng Li, but from\nan AOL account (chengli.brookings@aol.com) that was\nregistered by the attackers. The message asks the recipient for information on recent Tibetan self-immolations.\nThe level of customization and personalization used in\n\n\nFigure 9: Example of e-mail with Targeting Score 4\n\nthis message gives it a score of 4 (targeted, personalized).\n\n**Targeting Score 5 (Targeted Highly Personalized).**\nTargeting scores of 5 (targeted, highly personalized) require reference to internal information to the target organization that could not be obtained through open sources.\nExamples of messages scoring at this level include an\ne-mail that purported to come from a funder of China\nGroup 3 that provided details of an upcoming meeting\nthe group actually had scheduled with the funder. In\nanother example, Tibet Group 2 and Tibet Group 3 received separate e-mails that contained specific personal\ndetails about a South African group’s visit to Dharamsala, India that appear to have been repurposed from a\nreal private communication. The malicious attachment\ncontained an authentic travel itinerary, which would be\ndisplayed after the user opened the document. The private information used in these messages suggest that the\nattackers performed significant reconnaissance of these\ngroups and likely obtained the information through prior\ncompromise.\n\n\n-----",
