And the malicious software, invented by the well meaning\nbut wacko evolutionary biologist Joseph L. Popp, is thriving.\n\nAttacks spiked by [118% during the first quarter of this year, with](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-quarterly-threats-aug-2019.pdf) hackers singling out for\n[punishment state and local governments, while continuing to target businesses,](https://www.cnet.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-real-victim-small-business-local-corner-store/) [universities,](https://www.cnet.com/news/us-charges-iranian-hackers-over-ransomware-attacks-on-major-cities/)\n[and hospitals.](https://threatpost.com/alabama-hospitals-pay-up-ransomware-attack/148937/)\n\nRansomware’s robust health is due to three symbiotic factors: our increasing reliance on\ndigitization; ever more sophisticated crooks delivering more powerful viral strains, and the\nprevalence of untraceable ransoms—now almost always paid in bitcoin or other\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nHackers’ demands are also increasing along with the chilling efficacy of their product.\n[According to ransomware recovery specialists Coveware, the average ransom payment](https://www.coveware.com/)\n[increased by 184% in the first half of 2019. Largely, that’s thanks to an increasing number of](https://www.coveware.com/blog/2019/7/15/ransomware-amounts-rise-3x-in-q2-as-ryuk-amp-sodinokibi-spread?utm_source=emsisoft)\nattacks with new ransomware strains such as RYUK on large enterprises. The average\nransom demanded, internationally, is now $4,300.\n\nDesperate for a quick solution, most victims pay up, data recovery professionals told\n_Decrypt. In fact,_ [according to one report, many businesses have begun hoarding](https://on.code42.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Code42-Data-Exposure-Report-2-v11.pdf?utm_source=emsisoft)\n[cryptocurrencies, in case of an attack. Is it any wonder then that some analysts believe major](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/33977/is-ransomware-driving-up-the-price-of-bitcoin/)\nransomware attacks could be affecting the price of cryptocurrency?\n\n## Happy Birthday ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware refers to the category of computer viruses that are designed to quickly across\ncomputer networks and encrypt the files on them; the idea is to hold sensitive documents\nhostage until the victim pays ransom to the hacker.\n\n[The vulnerability of those targeted—nursing homes,](https://decrypt.co/12481/bitcoin-ransomware-paralyzes-nursing-homes-across-the-us) [providers of local infrastructure, and](https://decrypt.co/10389/ransomware-attacks-targeting-local-infrastructure-new-research-shows)\n[cities—gives them little alternative. In May, an RYUK attack on the City of Riviera Beach,](https://decrypt.co/7651/second-florida-city-gives-in-to-bitcoin-ransom-pays-out-500000)\n[Florida, forced the local government to cough up $600,000 to decrypt the frozen files.

The city [refused to pay.](https://threatpost.com/johannesburg-refuses-ransom-pay/149676/)\n\nBut as bad as the blight is, ransomware wasn’t born bad.\n\nHarvard-educated Popp, its inventor, was a polymath, and ransomware was born in 1989 out\nof his desire to combat AIDS, or [so he claimed. In his misguided determination to amass](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/the-computer-virus-that-haunted-early-aids-researchers/481965/)\nfunds to thwart the disease, he mailed more than 20,000 infected floppy disks to the delegate\nlist of a World Health Organisation forum. When the recipients ran the disks, their computers\nfroze, and an onscreen message instructed them to send funds to access a second disk that\nwould restore their files.\n\nJoseph L.Popp aged 18. Image: Eastlake North High School yearbook\nPopp was arrested, but deemed mentally unfit to stand trial due to his increasingly strange\nbehavior (which included wearing condoms on his nose and putting curlers in his beard to\nward off radiation.) He died in 2006 in a car accident and didn’t live to see his invention grow\nup, and—enhanced with a more effective method of encryption—become one of the world’s\nmost prevalent cybercrimes.\n\n## Ransomware and bitcoin\n\nFor many years, however, ransomware languished as a small-time enterprise. It wasn’t until\nbitcoin began gaining traction, in 2012, that it really took off. Hackers fell in love with the\ndecentralized digital currency, which made it difficult to trace or block payments, and it\nbecame ever easier to launder their ill-gotten gains as more cryptocurrencies hit the scene.\n\n“I don't think there is much doubt that ransomware and cryptocurrencies go hand in hand,”\n[Edward Cartwright, Professor of Economics at De Montfort University, in the city of Leicester,](https://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/academic-staff/business-and-law/edward-cartwright/edward-cartwright.aspx)\nUK, told Decrypt. “Ransomware is highly reliant on cryptocurrency and bitcoin in particular.”\n\n[Bitcoin accounted for about 98% of ransomware payments made in the first quarter of 2019,](https://www.coveware.com/blog/2019/4/15/ransom-amounts-rise-90-in-q1-as-ryuk-ransomware-increases?utm_source=emsisoft)\n[according to data from Coveware. As a result, it’s become an inextricable part of the](https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/33977/is-ransomware-driving-up-the-price-of-bitcoin/)\nransomware model.\n\n“Not only does it offer anonymity and untraceability to criminals it is also something that\nvictims are willing to engage with, said Cartwright.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The ransomware industry\n\nIndeed, some experts say the increasing acceptance and understanding of cryptocurrency\nhas driven ransomware from being a rarified crime into something far more common.\n\n“I strongly believe that cryptocurrency has played a role in the ransomware epidemic,” Victor\n[Congionti cofounder and CEO of New York-based Proven Data Recovery, told Decrypt.](https://www.provendatarecovery.com/)\n\nOf course, in some cases, victims are able to catch intruders before ransomware has been\nactivated or fully spread. In other cases, when the particular strain is “in the wild,” it may be\npossible to reverse engineer or create a “decryption utility,” Congionti said. But nine times out\nof ten the only way to reinstate files is to obtain decryption tools by paying the ransom, he\nadded.\n\nThus, a core service that Proven Data and other data recovery specialists offer is assisting\nvictims willing to pay hackers’ bitcoin ransoms.\n\nAnti-virus providers such as Emsisoft sometimes find ways to disable ransomware, and post\nthose fixes online for free. But they can decrypt ransomware only if there are errors in the\nunderlying software or if a security lapse allows the researchers to hack into the attacker’s\nserver, otherwise, it’s essentially bulletproof.\n\n“The majority of cases require payment, because they’re using strong encryption. And there’s\nno other opinion than to pay or restore from backups,” said Congionti.\n\nRansomware has helped put bitcoin in the news and we know that the price of bitcoin\ngoes up whenever it is in the news.\n\n—Edward Cartwright\nSince 2016, there have been around 4,000 ransomware attacks a day, amounting to 1.5\nmillion per year, according to statistics posted by the US Department of Homeland Security.\nLittle wonder then that firms like Proven Data have formed relationships with hackers, and\ncan often [negotiate the price down.](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-extortion-economy-how-insurance-companies-are-fueling-a-rise-in-ransomware-attacks) One hacker even offered data recovery firms exclusive\n“promo codes.” They were told that after paying they’d receive a code for a discount on a\nfuture ransom.\n\nCongionti said that simply paying the ransom is sometimes not enough. Hackers often\nprovide decryption keys that contain corrupted data, or missing files, which then needs to be\nchecked and reversioned in-house,\n\nTheir methods are also becoming increasingly sophisticated. Some have even initiated\nautomated schemes via smart contracts that ensure decryption when a victim sends a\npayment. There’s no negotiating between humans; the crime is automated on the\nblockchain.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Stockpiling bitcoin for ransom\n\nIt can cost [three times as much to recover data than to pay the ransom. The speed of](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-extortion-economy-how-insurance-companies-are-fueling-a-rise-in-ransomware-attacks)\nunlocking frozen accounts is often key for enterprises and organisations—for some, such as\nlaw firms, any downtime can be life threatening.\n\nAn October 2019 survey by data security startup Datto, polled 2,400 managed service\n[providers, finding that the average ransom attack cost $46,800 in downtime—10 times the](https://www.datto.com/uk/blog/a-look-at-ransomware-in-2019)\naverage ransom demand.\n\nAs a result, companies such as Proven Data stockpile bitcoin for contingencies. “That’s part\nof the service—having that bitcoin readily available so there’s no delay in getting a company\nup and running as soon as possible.” said Congionti.\n\nAnother survey, in 2018, by security solutions provider Code24 suggested that victims were\nstockpiling cryptocurrency to minimize costs and disruption in the wake of a ransomware\nattack. The research found that almost [three-quarters of Chief Information Security Officers](https://on.code42.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Code42-Data-Exposure-Report-2-v11.pdf?utm_source=emsisoft)\nchose to stash cryptocurrency for such an eventuality. But it’s notable that the study was\nconducted at the height of the cryptocurrency boom, when prices were marching ever\nupward.\n\nThe policies of insurance companies may also be compounding the issue. Driven partly by\n[the spread of ransomware, the cyber insurance market has grown rapidly. Between 2015](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-extortion-economy-how-insurance-companies-are-fueling-a-rise-in-ransomware-attacks)\nand 2017, US cyber premiums doubled to an estimated $3.1 billion, according to the most\nrecent data available.\n\nInvestigative non profit ProPublica published a report in August which found that insurance\ncompanies are helping to pay ransoms—inadvertently but essentially encouraging hackers to\ncontinue these attacks for profit.\n\nIndustry giant AIG reported in July that ransomware was its second leading cause of claims\nin 2018 and expected to increase in 2019. While the number of attacks had actually\ndecreased, AIG said they have also become more costly, as the targets have become more\nspecific. Criminals increasingly extort institutions that have deeper pockets and readily pay\nthe ransom to minimize disruption to their operations\n\n## Ransomware’s impact on bitcoin\n\nSome analysts believe all this ransomware activity is bound to affect bitcoin’s price.\n\n“Ransomware has helped put bitcoin in the news and we know that the price of bitcoin goes\nup whenever it is in the news,” said De Montfort University’s Cartwright “So, ransomware\nalso partly drives the price of bitcoin.”\n\n\n-----\n\nCartwright believes that the effect of a ransomware attack is significant enough to warrant\ninclusion in any algorithmic trading model that factors in external events, thus taking\nadvantage of prospective price movement in the wake of an attack.\n\nBut that doesn’t help local governments, businesses and law enforcement agencies, who are\n[desperate for solutions to ransomware attacks that threaten to cripple them.](https://www.cnet.com/news/ransomware-devastated-cities-in-2019-officials-hope-to-stop-a-repeat-in-2020/)\n\nRYUK ransomware is named after the god of death in the anime Death Note. Image: Flickr\nLast summer, in response to hackers demands for millions of dollars, a coalition of 227 US\nmayors vowed not to pay. Which might well be the best solution.\n\nData recovery experts, including Proven Data, report that ransomware attacks increasingly\nshow the characteristics of organized cybercrime, and fear that many ransom payments end\nup in the hands of terrorist groups. Through paying a ransom, local governments are\ninadvertently funding them.\n\n## A concerted attack\n\nGovernment officials hope that, though better security, they can properly protect cities from\nthese kinds of attacks. Congionti suggested that the government should make it mandatory\nfor businesses to go through some basic security protocols, as well.\n\nAnd this year, the White House and U.S. Senate [approved versions of a bill that would allow](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1158/actions)\nthe Department of Home Security to invest in resources to help states and cities deal more\neffectively with ransomware attacks.\n\nEither way, a policy of not paying ransom ought to help eradicate the scourge of\nransomware.\n\nBut for now, RYUK, a particularly robust ransomware that can sometimes even find and\ndestroy backups, is on the rise. It’s named after the god of death in the anime, Death Note,\nand is believed to have originated in North Korea.\n\nOver the first five months of 2019, RYUK [hit more than 500 schools and earned hackers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/over-500-us-schools-were-hit-by-ransomware-in-2019/)\nmore than $3 million in bitcoin. And security experts expect it, and new ransomware attacks\nagainst local governments, [will only ramp up in 2020.](https://decrypt.co/14321/south-koreas-security-agencies-predict-more-hacks-in-2020)\n\nAt the ripe adult age of 30, Popp’s invention is adept at outrunning most efforts to thwart it.\nThis is not a happy birthday\n\nCopy article link\n\n### Want to be a crypto expert?
