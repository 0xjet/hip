We have dubbed the malware FluBot due to its lack of a prominent\nname in the malware sample also because its spread rate and infection vector\nresemble the common flu. At the time of this writing, FluBot is largely targeting Spain,\nbut the malware sample contains textual content for targeting German-, Polish-, and\nEnglish-speaking users. During the notification period with Spanish authorities, several\nother researchers also published analysis report with the name “Cabassous“ however\nno information about the C&C and victim statistics was available. The PTI team has\nidentified the following Android application names used by the FluBot campaign :\n“Fedex,” “DHL,” “Correos,” and “Chrome.” The PTI team has deanonymized the C&C\nserver and discovered that FluBot has already infected more than 60,000 victims and\nstolen over 11 million phone numbers. FluBot has all of the generic banking malware\nfeatures such as overlay attack and SMS stealing for OTP, but the key differences are\nthat it :\n\n## • [Encrypts the part of request sent to the C&C server using RSA]\n • [Uses the contact lists of victims for spreading over SMS phishing messages]\n • [Uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) for determining the C&C server]\naddress\n\n## • [Uses multiple hacked legitimate web sites for hosting the malicious APK file]\n • [Does not have remote access capabilities (except socks proxy) similar to]\nCerberus/Alien or Medusa mobile banking malware\n\n\n#### 1.1 Scope\n\n**Package Name** **com.tencent.mm**\nMD5 1a2a4044cf18eed59e66c413db766145\nSHA256 30937927e8891f8c0fd2c7b6be5fbc5a05011c34a7375e91aad384b82b9e6a67\n\n3 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n\nThis report is based on findings obtained from the analysis made of FluBot malware. FluBot\nis a new Android banking malware that uses overlay attacks to perform webview-based\napplication phishing. The malware mainly targets mobile banking and cryptocurrency\napplications but also gathers a wide range of user data from all installed applications on a\ngiven device.\n\nUpon installation, FluBot malware instantly starts tracking applications being launched\non the device. Once it detects a target application launch, the malware starts an overlay\nattack. FluBot downloads the specially crafted login page of the opened target application\nfrom the C&C server. The downloaded webview phishing page is then laid over the target\napplication. The user suspects nothing because this event happens almost instantaneously\nwhen the legitimate application is opened. Once the application credentials are entered\ninto the overlayed phishing page, FluBot malware sends the credentials to the C&C server\ncontrolled by the attacker.\n\nThe FluBot malware also has the following capabilities :\n\n## • [Listening notifications]\n • [Reading and writing SMS messages]\n • [Getting contact lists]\n • [Performing calls]\n\n4 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2 Technical Analysis\n\nThe PTI team was able to identify following four different FluBot package names :\n“com.tencent.mm,” “com.tencent.mobileqq,” “com.clubbing.photos,” and “com.redtube.music.”\n\nThe report includes the technical details of all findings obtained within the scope of our\nmalware analysis, itself based on the application with the package name “com.tencent.mm.”\n\n#### 2.1 com.tencent.mm - FluBot\n\nThe application with the package name “com.tencent.mm” requires the following permissions.\n\n**Permission List**\nandroid.permission.WAKE_LOCK\nandroid.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES\nandroid.permission.CALL_PHONE\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\nandroid.permission.WRITE_SMS\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_SMS\nandroid.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE\nandroid.permission.SEND_SMS\nandroid.permission.REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS\nandroid.permission.NFC\nandroid.permission.REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\nandroid.permission.READ_SMS\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\nandroid.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE\nandroid.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE\n\nWith the above permissions, the malware in question is able to perform the following actions :\n\n## • [Internet access]\n • [Reading/Sending SMS]\n • [Reading the phone book]\n • [Performing Calls]\n • [Deleting an application]\n • [Ability to use Accessibility service]\n • [Reading notifications]\n\n5 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.2 com.tencent.mm - Packer and String Obfuscation\n\nFluBot uses a common Android malware packer that loads the decrypted DEX in runtime.\nWithout any hooks, analysts can access the dropped DEX in the ‘app_DynamicOptDex‘\nfolder. Only string obfuscation is present in the decrypted DEX. Most of the samples have the\nfollowing list of classes in the decrypted payload.\n\n## • [Bot]\n • [BotId]\n • [BrowserActivity]\n • [CardActivity]\n • [ComposeSmsActivity]\n • [ContactItem]\n • [DGA]\n • [ForegroundService]\n • [HttpCom]\n • [IntentStarter]\n • [LangTxt]\n • [MainActivity]\n • [MyAccessibilityService]\n • [MyNotificationListener]\n • [PanelReq]\n • [SmsReceiver]\n • [Spammer]\n • [Utils]\n • [SocksClient]\n • [PanelReq]\n\n#### 2.3 com.tencent.mm - Commands\n\nThe following table contains the list of available FluBot commands received from the C&C\nserver.\n\n**Command** **Description**\nBLOCK Block any notification\nUNINSTALL_APP Uninstall the given application via packagename\nSEND_SMS Send given text to given phone number\nRUN_USSD Running ussd code.\nSMS_INT_TOGGLE Toggle interception sms\nCARD_BLOCK Popup the credit card phishing page\nDISABLE_PLAY_PROTECT Disable play protect via accessibility\nOPEN_URL Open the given url via webview\nGET_CONTACTS Send contact list to server.

Webview Overlay Example**\n\nOther than targeted apps, FluBot can trigger on-demand credit card phishing if it gets the\n“CARD_BLOCK” command from the server. The relevant image is given in Figure [2].\n\n7 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2. Credit Card Phishing**\n\nFluBot blocks all incoming notifications when the BLOCK command is received from the\nserver. The relevant code snippet is given in Figure [3].\n\n**Figure 3. Notification removal code**\n\nFluBot malware is able make USSD calls to the codes sent from the C&C server. The related\ncode snippet is given in Figure [4].\n\n8 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4. Code allows running USSD code**\n\n#### 2.4 com.tencent.mm - SMS Spam\n\nFluBot is also able to set itself as the default SMS application by abusing accessibility\npermissions, thus allowing the malware to send SMS messages on demand. The related code\nsnippet is given in Figure [5].\n\n**Figure 5. SMS Auto Accept With Accessibility**\n\nOnce it has infected the victim’s device, FluBot sends all phonebook (contact list) numbers\nto the C&C server. The related code snippet is given in Figure [6].\n\n**Figure 6. Upload contact list to server**\n\nThe PTI team was able to observe the spreading behavior of the FluBot malware by\nanalyzing the C&C communication of an infected device. The FluBot C&C panel sends the\n\n9 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\nstolen phonebook (contact list) numbers and SMS text message contents to infected devices\nto send more phishing SMS messages. The spreading behavior of the FluBot malware is\nvery calculated. Instead of sending messages to every number from every infected device\n(flooding), it uses an SMS load distribution mechanism. The related code snippet is given in\nFigure [7].\n\n**Figure 7. Sending SMS functionality**\n\nSample sms messages from the server are given in the image below, Figure [8].\n\n10 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8. Sample targeted number and SMS text message**\n\n**Analyst Note : Taking a closer look at the links in SMS phishing messages reveals that the**\nthreat actors are using different hacked web application servers in almost every message.\nThis shows the FluBot operation’s level of sophistication, which distinguishes it from other\nconsumer-grade banking malware.\n\nFollowing the links inside the SMS phishing messages takes the victims to a legitimate website\nhacked by the threat actors. Hacked web application servers are configured to contain\nthe malicious APK file to requests with Android User-Agent. At the time of the PTI team’s\ninvestigation, attackers were using FedEx-themed campaigns. A sample phishing page is\ngiven in Figure [9] below.\n\n**Figure 9. Fedex Campaign**\n\n11 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.5 com.tencent.mm - DGA\n\nFluBot uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to obtain the address of the C&C server.\nThe DGA creates 2000 domains according to the current year and month. Domains consist\nof 15 characters with “com,” “ru,” and “cn” TLDs. The relevant DGA code is given in Figure [10].\n\n**Figure 10. DGA Seed Generation Code**\n\n**Figure 11. DGA Generate Domain**\n\n**Analyst** **Note** **:** You can access the DGA decoder Python code that\ngenerates active command and control server domains from the following link :\nhttps://github.com/prodaft/malware-ioc/blob/master/FluBot/dga_gen.py\n\nThe malware encrypts the part of request it sends to the server with the public RSA key. The\nrelevant code snippet is given in Figure [12].\n\n**Figure 12. RSA Encryption**\n\n12 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware passes the responses from the server through the decryption routine as seen in\nFigure [13].\n\n**Figure 13. Decryption of incoming request body**\n\nFluBot sends encrypted message to domains generated from DGA. It checks whether if the\ndecrypted text contains the BotId value sent in the initial request. Following flow chart briefly\ndescribes FluBot’s C&C validation routine. [14].\n\n**Figure 14. Flow chart for validation**\n\n**Analyst Note : Because of this design FluBot is immune to traditional sinkhole approaches.**\n\nThe sample request sent to the malware command and control server is given in the image\nbelow, Figure [15].\n\n13 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 15.

The relevant permission request\nmessage is shown in Figure [16].\n\n14 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 16. Accessibility Popup**\n\n**Analyst Note : Normally, when the button in the confirmation popup is pressed immediately,**\nthe application shows an error message saying “Please read the message.” When same\nbutton is pressed after waiting for approximately 3-4 seconds, it directs the user to the\naccessibility settings.\n\nMalware uses accessibility to perform different activities such as the overlay attack. If the\ntargeted package name exists in the triggered event, FluBot takes the texts on the screen,\nstarts the BrowserActivity, and creates an overlay with the help of accessibility. The related\ncode snippet is given in Figure [17].\n\n15 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 17. Overlay Code**\n\nIn Figure [18] below is given in the screen view column where the texts of the target\napplication screen are received and sent to the server.\n\n**Figure 18. Accesibility Logger**\n\nWith Accessibility, FluBot is able to deactivate the Play Protect automatically. The related\ncode snippet is given in Figure [19].\n\n**Figure 19. Disable Play Protect**\n\nFluBot also prevents the user from deleting itself by abusing the accessibility permission. The\nrelated code snippet is given in Figure [20].\n\n**Figure 20.

The related\ncode snippet is given in Figure [21].\n\n**Figure 21. Auto accept permissions**\n\nThe malware automatically obtains “ignore battery optimizations” rights via accessibility.\nThe related code snippet is given in Figure [22].\n\n**Figure 22. Get Ignore Battery Optimizations rights**\n\n**Analyst Note : Generally, Android banking malware has two main ways of running in the**\nbackground without being visible to the user. The first way is to avoid having to start itself\nas a foreground service by obtaining the “ignore battery optimizations” permission. The\nsecond way is to start itself as a foreground service and delete notifications from the\nnotification bar with the help of the notification listener. FluBot opts for the first of these\nmethods.\n\n17 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.7 Command and Control Panel\n\nAt the time of analysis, the domain generation algorithm of the FluBot was dissected and\nactive C&C servers were identified by the PTI team. The root directory of the C&C server\ncontains a message from the threat actor intended for the analysts. Message contains the\ntext “Добро пожаловать, пиздюки-разведчики. Вам всего доброго, хорошего настроения\nи здоровья” and a video of Dmitry Medvedev.\n\n**Figure 23. Command and Control Panel Greeting Message**\n\nOur threat intelligence team was able to analyze the C&C panel by deanonymizing the\nFluBot servers. The botnet panel is designed as a rudimentary PHP management dashboard\nwith little to no detail. Despite its simplistic view, the control panel was able to handle around\n60,000 infected device connections without any performance issues.\n\n18 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698.

It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information ini\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2.8 Statistics\n\nThe C&C panel also contains detailed statistics of the infected victims. At the time of\nanalysis, FluBot had already infected more than 60,000 devices. Over 97% of the victims\nseemed to be based in Spain. Total number of collected phone numbers appears to be\nmore than 11 million as of writing this report.\n\n**Figure 26. Victims Statistics Page**\n\nThe statistics page of the panel also contains details about the device manufacturers,\nAndroid version, device language, and telecommunication operator name. When FluBot\nsuccessfully obtains the banking credentials, they are sent to the C&C and stored with the\nfollowing Figure [27] log format.\n\n**Figure 27. Victims Statistics Page**\n\nEach log entry for the infected device may contain the SMS messages, banking credentials,\ndevice contacts, and application webview text logs, all of which can be used for extracting\nany kind of text-based credentials from every application that uses webview panes.\n\n21 / 25\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document, as well as the information contained herein, shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged\n\ninformation of PRODAFT and shall be subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in General Data Protection\n\nRegulations and Law on Protection of Personal Data numbered 6698.

FluBot sets a new precedent of spreading methods and DGA implementations.\nDuring a very short timeframe, FluBot is able to infect more than 60,000 mobile phones.\nCurrently there are more than 11 million phone numbers collected from the infected devices\nwhich represents 25% of the total population in Spain. We estimate that the malware is\ncabaple to collect almost all phone numbers in Spain within 6 months time if no action\nis taken. In other malware families, the SMS spreading functionality tends not to work as\neffectively. However, the SMS spreading functionality of FluBot (Smishing module) is well\nimplemented and works in nearly all setups. In addition to the spreading method, its novel\nDGA approach makes it almost impossible to sinkhole the threat with traditional techniques.\n\nIt should also be noted that FluBot can easily be adapted to spread to different countries\nwith a simple configuration change in its codebase.
