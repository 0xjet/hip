These flaws are already known, and many already have patches. The problem is that\npeople and companies don’t patch their systems or software, giving attackers a way in.\n\nBitdefender security researchers found a new version of an already-known vulnerability\nscanner. The bot, written in Golang, targets the “Ultimate GDPR & CCPA Compliance\n[Toolkit” plugin for WordPress. This particular plugin has a critical vulnerability that lets](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-vulnerability-in-wordpress-ultimate-gdpr-ccpa-compliance-toolkit-plugin/)\nattackers redirect traffic to a malicious website.\n\n### Why WordPress plugins?\n\n\n-----\n\nWordPress, the largest platform of its kind, uses countless plugins. Its modularity allowed it\nto grow, but it’s also a reason threat actors target it often. Vulnerable and unpatched plugins\npose a serious security problem, creating a gold mine for criminals.\n\nThe “Ultimate GDPR & CCPA Compliance Toolkit” lets websites adhere to the strict rules of\nThe General Data Protection Regulation in Europe. Failure to comply with this regulation\nexposes website owners to huge fines. If they want European visitors, they need something\nin place to deal with the data collected from them.\n\nWhen researchers found the vulnerability in the “Ultimate GDPR & CCPA Compliance\nToolkit,” the plugin had around 6,000 sales. Anyone using version 2.4 or lower was exposed\nto this vulnerability. The developer team fixed the issue on January 28, 2021, bringing us full\ncircle to the n-day vulnerabilities. Simply put, if the websites using this plugin haven’t\nupgraded, they are prone to attacks.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nThe bot retrieves the front page of the web service and looks for certain strings. These\ncorrespond to attacker-controlled domains; their presence indicates that the target has\nalready been compromised. Otherwise, subsequent checks show whether the target uses\nthe vulnerable WordPress plugin, in which case the exploit is launched.\n\nThe following excerpt from the main.make_ct_ultimate_gdpr function shows the validation\nperformed prior to launching the exploit:\n\nAttacker-controlled domains:\n\ntravelfornamewalking[.]ga\nlovegreenpencils[.]ga\nlinetoadsactive[.]ga\nlowerthenskyactive[.]ga\ntransandfiestas[.]ga\nstrongcapitalads[.]ga\ntalkingaboutfirms[.]ga\ndaryinformtrand[.]com\ndontkinhooot[.]tw\ndeclarebusinessgroup[.]ga\n\nAs described in the advisory, the vulnerability lets the attacker overwrite the settings file. The\nJSON file containing the new settings is not bundled in the malware, being retrieved from the\nfilesystem (“cc4.json”).\n\nIn previous campaigns by this threat actor, the chain through which a WordPress instance is\ncompromised was leading visitors to malicious pages:\n\n\n-----\n\nTypical exploit flow in previous campaigns\n⦁ the bot queries the C2 for a target domain\n⦁ the bot scans the target for vulnerabilities and sends reports to the C2\n⦁ in some cases, the bot launches the exploit, compromising the target by injecting data\n⦁ visitors of the target site execute the attacker-supplied script and are redirected to a\nmalicious website\n\nFor example, the actor injects an external script into the index page (sample:\nd492dd3608741c9128eb5a8dfc1ae688b63bfe8daf9ecaa3ca784aa654a92ef8):\n\nThe chain of redirects that leads the visitor from the initial injected script to the malicious\nwebsite can be easily followed:\n\nThis time, the vulnerability enables the attacker to reach the same goal without extra steps.\n\nBased on previous campaigns from the same threat actor, we can assert that its likely goal\nremains the same, to infect websites and redirect visitors to malicious pages.\n\nFortunately, a few indicators of compromise can help us identify it more easily.\n\n### IOCs\n\n**Hashes:**\n\nb8aa5b2d7a9febcbca31a6efd3327319c2efe4857e082e65f1333caf65b4f3be (scanner bot)\n\n4277afc7be775bdad3b7c1be0e793401f79136c120cb667c00b55bec2d23a07e (scanner bot)\n\n15117f2d1783063f26c58d1c0ea755d952facbf12e7fd8efc077a0a2780e5906 (archive)\n\nd492dd3608741c9128eb5a8dfc1ae688b63bfe8daf9ecaa3ca784aa654a92ef8 (script)\n\n**Network indicators:**\n\nlovegreenpencils[.[ga\ntravelfornamewalking[.]ga\nlinetoadsactive[.]ga\nlowerthenskyactive[.]ga\ntransandfiestas[.]ga\nstrongcapitalads[.]ga\ntalkingaboutfirms[.]ga\ndaryinformtrand[.]com\ndontkinhooot[.]tw\ndeclarebusinessgroup[.]ga\n195.2.71.173:4112\n\n\n-----\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[miscellaneous](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/miscellaneous/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Silvia PRIPOAE\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/spripoae/)\n\n## Silviu STAHIE\n\nSilviu is a seasoned writer who followed the technology world for almost two decades,\ncovering topics ranging from software to hardware and everything in between.\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/sstahie/)\n\n\n## Silvia PRIPOAE\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/spripoae/)\n\n## Silviu STAHIE\n\nSilviu is a seasoned writer who followed the technology world for almost two decades,\ncovering topics ranging from software to hardware and everything in between.\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/sstahie/)\n\n\n-----",
