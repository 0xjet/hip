How can a company detect cyber attacks\nassociated with this war? What are the IoCs that need to be monitored? The SOCRadar\nResearch Team did a thorough analysis to find the answers that you can find all below.\n\nSkip to [how SOCRadar provide related threat intelligence feeds, including IoCs, for free and](https://socradar.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-russian-cyber-escalation-in-ukraine/#How-SOCRadar-Can-Help)\nsee [how to protect your company from the potential impacts of Russia-Ukraina cyber crisis.](https://socradar.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-russian-cyber-escalation-in-ukraine/#What-to-Do-to-Mitigate-Potential-Impacts-of-the-Russian-Ukrainian-Cyber-Crisis)\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused a substantial increase in cyberattacks. The\npublic and private organizations can be impacted even before they are not located in the\nregion. Therefore, the SOCRadar analyst team, monitoring the situation from its early\nhours, has gathered initial findings in this blog post.\n\nHere is what you should know about the cyber repercussions of the Russian-Ukraine war:\n\nBeginning from January 13, 2022, various companies in Ukraine were infected with\nharmful malware designed to render targeted machines useless. The malware deleted\nvictims’ machines before passing itself off as a ransomware attack without offering a\nransom payment and recovery mechanism.\n\nThe first wave of cyberattacks on February 15th, mostly potent DDoS, targeted\nUkrainian government organizations. Several agencies, including the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs and the Security and Defense Council, were impacted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing the Russian troops invasion, the second wave of DDoS attacks started on\nFebruary 23. The target included government agencies and two of the largest stateowned banks. Attacks were paired with some disinformation attempts in which SMS\nwere sent to customers falsely claiming the ATMs were out of order.\n\nIn addition to DDoS attacks, two malware equipped with significant destructive\ncapabilities has been found in the attacks. HermeticWiper is utilized to delete the data\nin a digital device that cannot be recovered. Recently discovered Cyclops Blink is\nemployed to exfiltrate data from the network.\n\nUnderground groups such as Anonymous and Conti ransomware groups have picked\ntheir sides in the cyber conflict. The largest hacktivist initiative, Anonymous, launched\na virtual war against Russia. Conti, the notorious ransomware gang, decided to stand\nwith Russia threatening to attack any rivals’ critical infrastructure.\n\nDark web forums have become a show-off platform for warring factions. Detected by\nSOCRadar, several posts have been published alleging that sensitive information from\nthe government organizations was leaked.\n\nYou can also find lists of IoCs, TTPs, and Yara rules in this article.\n\n## What Happened So Far?\n\nDuring the 2021–2022 Russian – Ukrainian crisis, a series of cyberattacks took down\nmore than a dozen of Ukraine’s government websites, including the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Security and Defense Council.\n\nAfter recognizing territorial claims of self-declared separatist republics in eastern Ukraine,\n[Russian force deployments in these regions coincided with two massive DDoS attacks](https://socradar.io/the-rising-threat-in-the-financial-industry-ddos-attacks/)\n(Distributed Denial-of-Service) with destructive malware implications targeting Ukraine.\n\nThe first wave of cyber-attacks on Ukraine started on February 15th, and the second one\non February 23rd, made many Ukrainian governments, military, and bank websites\ninaccessible.\n\nRussian cyberattacks against Ukraine have led hackers, ransomware gangs, and\ncompanies to pick upsides. Underground groups publicly expressed their side in the military\nconflict.\n\nIn the underground world, the actors have diverse decisions. Conti, the notorious\nransomware group and claimed to be a state-sponsored threat actor, announced that they\nwill strike back if cyber-attacks are conducted against Russia. In two different posts, the\ngroup states that they would target the opposite countries’ critical infrastructure on its official\nwebsite.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhich Cyber Threat Actor Takes Which Side in the Ukraine-Russia War?\n\nMany different cyber threat actors who continue their operations on the dark web have\nactively participated in the\n\nRussia-Ukraine war in cyberspace\n\n. During the conflict that has lasted for nearly a week, many threat actors have declared\ntheir sides or switched sides. Many threats, from hacktivist groups to ransomware gangs,\nannounced their support for one of the warring parties.\n\nFirst, the Anonymous group announced that it had declared its support for Ukraine. After\nthis announcement, some websites belonging to Russia’s state and private sector became\nunavailable.\n\nIn another tweet, Anonymous TV, an account close to Anonymous, claimed that\nAnonymous leaked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defense website. The group\nalso claimed to breach Tetradr, a Belarusian weapon manufacturer and leaked about\n200GB of emails.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Conti ransomware group](https://socradar.io/dark-web-threat-profile-conti-ransomware-group/)**\n\n, which has made a name for itself with its organized ransomware attacks, announced that it\nsided with Russia. It was noted that the group exhibited a slightly softer attitude in the\nsecond statement made later. In this statement, Conti claimed that they did not support the\nwar. Some insiders not happy with Conti’s support for Russia leaked inside jabber chats of\nthe group.\n\nThe CoomingProject group, which has been selling/sharing the data it has obtained from\ncritical institutions since 2021 on Russian-speaking hacker forums, was also among the\nhacker groups that sided with\n\n**Russia**\n. The Cooming Project has announced that they will respond if the Russian\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment targets a cyberattack\n\n.\n[LockBit](https://socradar.io/the-story-of-lockbit-ransomware/)\n\nannounced that it was not a party to the war. Noting that there are hackers from different\nnationalities within the group, the group stated that people from many countries, not only\nfrom\n\n**Ukraine and Russia**\nbut also from China to the USA, are working for them. “Business is important to us, and we\nall take an apolitical stance. We are only concerned with money.”\n\nAlong with Anonymous, another [hacktivist group targeting Russia](https://labs.socradar.com/)\n\nis AgainstTheWest. In the statement made by the group, it was stated that the systems of\nvarious Russian government institutions were infected with ransomware, attacked with\ndata-destroying malware, and all the data were seized.\n\nThe Red Bandits, known for their data breach attacks, CyberGhost, and Sandworm groups,\nknown for their hacking and\n\n[DDoS attacks](https://socradar.io/the-rising-threat-in-the-financial-industry-ddos-attacks/)\n, were shared on the hacker channels that they were Russian supporters. It is known that\nthe Raidforum Admins group, which came to the fore with cyber sanctions against\n\n**Russia, is in the ranks of Ukraine.**\n\nSome groups that carried out DDoS attacks on behalf of Ukraine are as follows as of\nFebruary 27: “IT Army of\n\n**Ukraine**\n, BlackHawk, and Anonymous Liberland & PWN Bar hack team.” It is understood that the\nransomware group called Belarussian Cyber Partisans is a supporter of “free Ukraine,” as\nfar as it is followed on Twitter channels.\n\nOn the other side, the Lapsu$ extortion group claimed to breach Nvidia, one of the largest\ntechnology manufacturers in the world. The US and western sanctions in retaliation for\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine shut off the supply from leading US groups such as Intel, AMD,\nand Nvidia at Russia’s military and its tech industry. After the sanction decision, Russian\norigin hacker groups allegedly shared data about hashes of Nvidia’s employees on a\nTelegram Channel monitored by SOCRadar.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacker groups supporting Ukraine:**\n\nAnonymous, AgainstTheWest (AWT), Belarusian Cyber Partisans, GhostSec, IT Army of\nUkraine, KelvinSecurity Hacking Team, BlackHawk, Anonymous Liberland & the PWN-BAR\nHack Team, Raidforum Admins, GNG, NB65, ECO, Raidforums2, ContiLeaks, SHDWSec,\nGhostClan, Eye of the Storm, and Netsec.\n\n**Hacker groups supporting Russia:**\n\nSandworm, Conti, CoomingProject, The Red Bandits, and CyberGhost.\n\n## 2022 Russian-Ukrainian Crisis: The FirstWave of Cyberattacks\n\n\n-----\n\nBeginning from January 13, 2022, various companies in Ukraine were infected with harmful\nmalware designed to render targeted machines useless.\n\nThe malware deleted victims’ machines before passing itself off as a [ransomware attack](https://socradar.io/how-can-you-detect-ransomware-attacks-using-socradar/)\nwithout offering a ransom payment and recovery mechanism.\n\nThe malware has infected multiple Ukrainian government institutions, non-profit, and\ninformation technology organizations.\n\nOn February 15th, Ukraine became the victim of numerous powerful DDoS attacks again,\nresulting in the disruption of services in government agencies and state-owned banks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe affected enterprises were two of the largest state-owned banks, namely Privatbank and\n[Oschadbank, and several other government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense](https://socradar.io/solutions/federal-government/)\nand the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nThe attacks were carried out by flooding the web servers with high traffic volumes the\nserver could not handle. As a result, the servers were inaccessible for several hours. Many\nUkrainians could not use mobile banking apps and log into their accounts on the abovementioned banks’ websites, even though they were up and running.\n\nFake SMS messages customers of Privatbank received\n\non February 15th\nOn the same day, customers of Privatbank has received fake SMS messages claiming that\n[the ATMs of the bank were down, according to the cyberpolice of Ukraine. The cyberpolice](https://cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vstanovlyuye-osib-prychetnyx-do-rozsylannya-sms-povidomlen-shhodo-zboyiv-u-roboti-bankomativ-7072/)\nstated that these SMS messages did not reflect reality and were just mere parts of an\n“information attack.”\n\nIn addition to the state-owned banks, the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of\n**Ukraine were also attacked on the 15th of February. The website of the Ministry of Defense**\nwas taken down, unable to operate for several hours.\n\nUkraine’s online news agency Ukranyska Pravda states that these attacks are potent DDoS\nattacks on government agencies and have never happened before on this scale.\n\nA Snapshot shows that the Ministry of Defense was inaccessible on February 15th.\nTranslation of the sentence: “The site is under maintenance” (Source: Wayback Machine)\n\n## The Second Wave of Cyber Attacks on Ukraine: Deadlier than the First Wave\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the 23rd of February, Ukraine woke up to a new series of cyber-attacks threatening to\ndisrupt the services of enterprises and several government agencies of Ukraine.\n\nThese [cyber-attacks were in parallel with Ukraine’s invasion by the Russian military. As](https://socradar.io/top-5-cyber-attacks-in-the-asia-pacific-apac-in-2021/)\nthe Russian army crossed Ukraine’s border, numerous malicious cyber-attacks believed to\nbe coming from Russia were launched.\n\nTwo of the largest state-owned banks (Privatbank and Oschadbank) were targeted once\nagain, along with several government agencies with a non-ending stream of DDoS attacks.\nThe websites of government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of\nForeign Affairs, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the targeted banks became\ninaccessible due to the attacks.\n\nThe State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine said on\nthe 23rd of February, acknowledging the attacks and the aftermath:\n\n“Today, websites of a number of government and banking institutions have undergone a\nmassive DDoS attack again. Some of the attacked information systems are not available or\nwork intermittently. It is due to switching traffic to another provider to minimize damage.”\n\nAlong with DDoS attacks targeting Ukrainian organizations, two important cybersecurity\n[firms, namely ESET and Broadcom’s Symantec, revealed that a new data-wiper malware](https://socradar.io/resources/financial-institutions-data-breaches-on-deep-web/)\nhad targeted Ukrainian organizations’ computer networks.\n\nThe new data-wiper is a malware that deletes data on a device for the data to be\nunrecoverable and the operating system to stop working correctly.\n\nBesides the new data-wiper, a new malware known as Cyclops Blink, which targets the\n**Ukrainian organizations in the second wave of cyberattacks, has been identified by a joint**\nUK – US advisory and might be used remotely to access networks.\n\n[The malware is believed to be utilized by Sandworm, an APT group. In the past, the group](https://socradar.io/how-to-prevent-attacks-by-apt-groups-using-socradar/)\nhas been linked to the Russian GRU.\n\n[Moreover, Cyclops Blink looks to be a replacement for the VPNFilter malware that was](https://labs.socradar.com/vpnradar/)\ndiscovered in 2018, and its deployment could allow Sandworm to access networks\nremotely.\n\nWestern Allies of Ukraine declare their readiness to support Ukraine in cyberspace. The\nEuropean Defence Agency (EDA) tweeted on 24 February that Cyber Rapid Response\nTeam (CRRT) was activated following a request from Ukraine. EDA website states that\nCRRT will support Ukraine in monitoring the threat landscape and detecting and mitigating\ncyber attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the other hand, news outlets reported on 24 February that some Russian government\nentities’ websites were not accessible. The official website of the Ministry of Defence of the\nRussian Federation was responding with “HTTP ERROR 418” by 7 PM on 24 February. We\nunderstand that Russia blocked access to this domain based on geography as a security\nmechanism.\n\n## What are the Dark Web Activities Related to Russia-Ukraine War?\n\nOn the [dark web, threat actors allegedly began to sell database data of citizens of Ukraine](https://socradar.io/solutions/dark-and-deep-web-monitoring/)\nand data from several Government departments.\n\n\n-----\n\nRaidForum deleted some posts related to the Ukraine Hack.\n\nOne of the posts allegedly shared a leak of US Special Operation Command.\n\nSome of the information allegedly to be shared in the forums, on the other hand, claims that\ndata sharing against Russia has started.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How SOCRadar Can Help?\n\nYou can reach all these IoCs related to the Russia – Ukraine War and Russian Cyber\nWeapons from the [Intelligence Feed on the SOCRadar Platform.](https://platform.socradar.com/threat/intelligence/feeds?tab=intelligences_feed)\n\n[IOC list targeted Ukraine available in SOCRadar Threat Feed Database.](https://platform.socradar.com/threat/intelligence/feeds?tab=intelligences_feed)\n\n[If you are not a SOCRadar customer, you can register for the Free Edition to access this](https://socradar.io/free-edition/)\nIoC and other feeds.\n\n[Get Free Access Now](https://socradar.io/free-edition/)\n\nYou can reach all these IoCs related to the Russia – Ukraine War and Russian Cyber\nWeapons from the [Intelligence Feed on the SOCRadar Platform.](https://platform.socradar.com/threat/intelligence/feeds?tab=intelligences_feed)\n\n[IOC list targeted Ukraine available in SOCRadar Threat Feed Database.](https://platform.socradar.com/threat/intelligence/feeds?tab=intelligences_feed)\n\n## List of IoC Sources Related to Russia-Ukraine War\n\nBesides SOCRadar Intelligence Feeds and IoC details below of Russian Cyber Weapons,\nmany organizations and cybersecurity companies also provide IoC lists of malware recently\nused by Russian hacker groups.\n\n## Technical Analysis of Russian Cyber Weapons\n\n### HermeticWiper: A Catastrophic Malware\n\nESET Research has found that a new data wiper malware dubbed HermeticWiper has been\ndiscovered on Ukrainian computers and machines in Latvia and Lithuania. ESET products\nfirst detected the malware as Win32/KillDisk.NCV around 3 p.m. UTC on Wednesday,\n\n\n-----\n\nFebruary 23rd, 2022.\n\nThe compilation timestamp shows December 28th, 2021, which suggests the attack was\nprepared for at least two months. The wiper attacks started after a series of DDoS attacks\nhit several important websites in the country and brought them down.\n\nSince it is a developing story, some details might change, but HermeticWiper abuses some\nlegitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software.\n\nAfter the initial entry, attackers took control of the Active Directory (AD) server and pushed it\nusing the default Group Policy Object (GPO). In the case of an attack against at least one\norganization in Ukraine, the attackers seemed to gain access to the network on December\n23, 2021, via malicious SMB activity against a Microsoft Exchange Server, according to the\nSymantec Threat Hunter Team. It was immediately followed by credential theft.\n\nA [web shell was also installed on January 16, before the wiper was deployed on February](https://socradar.io/dozens-of-wordpress-plugins-backdoored-in-supply-chain-attack/)\n23. However, it is not obvious how the initial access to the Active Directory was gained.\n\nThe malware called HermeticWiper referenced the digital certificate used to sign the\nsample. Sentinel Labs’ initial analysis shows that the digital certificate is issued under\n‘Hermetica Digital Ltd’ and is valid as of April 2021. There are no known legitimate files\nsigned with this certificate.\n\n**How Does It Work?**\n\nAccording to Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade from Sentinel Labs, Hermetic Wiper uses a\nknown and tested technique similar to the Lazarus Group (Destover) and APT33\n(Shamoon) with Eldos Rawdisk. However, the Wiper abuses a different driver:\n```\nempntdrv[.]sys\n\n```\nto access the file system without calling Windows APIs. After that, the Hermetic Wiper\nfocuses on corrupting the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record (MBR), for every physical\ndrive to stop the booting process.\n\n**Who Gets Affected by HermeticWiper?**\n\nThe target seems to be the host computers in critical networks. The malware does not try to\nsteal or exfiltrate data, but it just destroys it. In a time of crisis, the malware could create\nchaos by deleting importing data stored in the personal computers of the key personnel.\n\n**Targeted Devices: Windows device**\n\n**[Targeted Countries: Ukraine, Latvia, Czechia,](https://otx.alienvault.com/browse/global/pulses?q=country:%22Czechia%22)** [Poland, and Lithuania](https://otx.alienvault.com/browse/global/pulses?q=country:%22Poland%22)\n\n**Targeted Sectors:**\n\n\n-----\n\nFinancial, Defense, Aviation, and IT services sectors\n\n**Malware Family: NCV**\n\n**TTPs of HermeticWiper**\n\n\nMITRE\nATT&CK\n\nMITRE\nATT&CK\n\nMITRE\nATT&CK\n\nMITRE\nATT&CK\n\n\nT1059.003 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command\nShell\n\nT1059.001 Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\n\nT1542.003 Pre-OS Boot: Bootkit\n\nT1561 Disk Wipe\n\n\n**IoCs of HermeticWiper**\n\n\nFileHashSHA256\n\nFileHashSHA1\n\nFileHashSHA1\n\nFileHashMD5\n\nFileHashMD5\n\nFileHashMD5\n\nFileHashMD5\n\nFileHashSHA256\n\n\n[1bc44eef75779e3ca1eefb8ff5a64807dbc942b1e4a2672d77b9f6928d292591](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/1bc44eef75779e3ca1eefb8ff5a64807dbc942b1e4a2672d77b9f6928d292591)\n\n[912342f1c840a42f6b74132f8a7c4ffe7d40fb77](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/912342f1c840a42f6b74132f8a7c4ffe7d40fb77)\n\n[61b25d11392172e587d8da3045812a66c3385451](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/61b25d11392172e587d8da3045812a66c3385451)\n\n[eb845b7a16ed82bd248e395d9852f467](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/eb845b7a16ed82bd248e395d9852f467)\n\n[a952e288a1ead66490b3275a807f52e5](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/a952e288a1ead66490b3275a807f52e5)\n\n[231b3385ac17e41c5bb1b1fcb59599c4](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/231b3385ac17e41c5bb1b1fcb59599c4)\n\n[095a1678021b034903c85dd5acb447ad](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/095a1678021b034903c85dd5acb447ad)\n\nca3c4cd3c2edc816c1130e6cac9bdd08f83aef0b8e6f3d09c2172c854fab125f\n\n\n**Yara Rules for HermeticWiper:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mitigation for HermeticWiper:**\n\nMake sure you patched all the critical vulnerabilities and closed all the essential ports\ndiscovered SOCRadar Attackmapper module\nIf you have anti-malware programs from vendors like SentinelOne or Symantec, their\nscanners can catch HermeticWiper.

The group\nis a part of Russia’s (foreign military intelligence agency) GRU’s Main Centre for Special\nTechnologies or GTsST.\n\nThe [malicious cyber activities such as disruption of Ukrainian electricity in 2015, Industroyer](https://socradar.io/faq/cyber-threat-intelligence/)\nin 2016, NotPetya in 2017, the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 2018 cyberattacks, and\nattacks against Georgia in 2019 were all attributed to Sandworm. The new malware,\nCyclops Blink appears to replace the VPNFilter malware exposed in 2018\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the report, NCSC, CISA, FBI, NSA, and industry partners have identified a\n[large-scale modular malware framework affecting network devices. This new malware strain](https://socradar.io/a-rising-threat-in-mobile-what-is-banking-malware/)\nis named Cyclops Blink. The report claims that the malware deployed at least June 2019,\nfourteen months after its successor VPNFilter was disrupted.\n\nAs with VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink deployment also seems indiscriminate and widespread. So\nfar, Cyclops Blink has been only deployed to WatchGuard devices by Sandworm.\n[(WatchGuard Technologies Inc. is a network security vendor that provides products](https://socradar.io/company/partners/)\ndesigned to protect computer networks from outside threats.) However, Sandworm could\nlikely use the malware to target other architectures and firmware.\n\nThe malware is highly sophisticated and modular, capable of sending device information\nback to a C2 server. Cyclops Blink could download and execute files. The modular nature of\nthe malware also allows Sandworm to implement additional functionalities as needed.\n\nAfter the exploitation, Cyclops Blink will generally arrive in a firmware update that achieves\npersistence once the target device is rebooted, making it very hard to remove.

Some\nUkrainian websites were not accessible due to heavy DDoS attacks both on February 15\nand 16. Banks, Government, and Military websites were impacted. Both UK and US officials\nhave attributed these attacks to a known Russian GRU infrastructure stating The US has\ntechnical data to back it up.\n\nFortunately, the attacks` scale was only moderate. Therefore, the impacted sites recovered\nwithin hours. During attacks, it is reported that some customers could not access the\nbanking websites and, in minimal cases, ATMs became unavailable too. In addition to these\nattacks, some fraudulent [SMS messages were sent to Ukrainian phones, possibly creating](https://socradar.io/what-is-a-smishing-attack/)\npanic.\n\nThe text messages said, “Due to technical circumstances, Privatbank ATMs do not work on\nFebruary 15. We apologize”. These messages were sent from Polish, Austrian and\nEstonian numbers. Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine also reported a\ndenial of service attack against the ”.gov.ua” DNS servers; and a BGP hijacking attack\nagainst the Privatbank IP space causing difficulties routing traffic to their network.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian CERT, 360Netlab, and BadPackets, the source of these attacks\nwas [a Mirai botnet. Researchers matched the gathered IOCs to a botnet named Katana,](https://socradar.io/what-are-botnets-digital-zombie-herds/)\nwhich is, in fact, a variant of Mirai with improved DDoS capabilities. Katana source code is\n\n\n-----\n\navailable for purchase for less than a thousand dollars, and it is possibly shared for free on\nsome deep and dark websites.\n\nAccording to Malpedia, Mirai was one of the first significant botnets targeting exposed\nnetworking devices running Linux. Mirai was first discovered in August 2016 by\nMalwareMustDie.\n\nIt targeted various networked embedded devices such as IP cameras, home routers\n[belonging to many different vendors, and other IoT devices. Since the source code was](https://socradar.io/detecting-iot-devices-for-your-company/)\npublished on “Hack Forums,” many variants of the Mirai family appeared, infecting mostly\nhome networks worldwide.\n\nWhen an IoT device like network cameras are publicly accessible, they could be easily\ntargeted and were exploited by the attacker to perform the DDoS. Due to how the exploit\nworks, the records of their exploitation can be seen by anyone. It should also be noted that\na file matching the attack IoCs was uploaded to the VirusTotal on February 13th.\n\nTherefore, compromising the IoT devices had been started at least a couple of days before\nthe DDoS attacks. Even though the impacted sites came back online relatively quickly, this\ndoes not dismiss the fact that this was a sophisticated and well-organized attack to create\ninstability and chaos in Ukraine.\n\n**Targeted Country: Ukraine**\n\n**Target Sectors: Banking, Military, Government**\n\n**Malware Family: Mirai**\n\n**TTPs of Katana:**\n\nMITRE ATT&CK T1583.005 Botnet\n\nMITRE ATT&CK T1525 Implant Internal Image\n\nMITRE ATT&CK T1499 Endpoint Denial of Service\n\n**IoCs of Katana:**\n\nURL [http://5.182.211.5/rip.sh](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/url/http:%2F%2F5.182.211.5%2Frip.sh)\n\nPv4 [5.182.211.5](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/ip/5.182.211.5)\n\n\nFileHashSHA256\n\n\n[978672b911f0b1e529c9cf0bca824d3d3908606d0545a5ebbeb6c4726489a2ed](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/978672b911f0b1e529c9cf0bca824d3d3908606d0545a5ebbeb6c4726489a2ed)\n\n\n-----\n\nFileHashSHA256\n\nFileHashSHA1\n\nFileHashMD5\n\n\n[82c426d9b8843f279ab9d5d2613ae874d0c359c483658d01e92cc5ac68f6ebcf](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/82c426d9b8843f279ab9d5d2613ae874d0c359c483658d01e92cc5ac68f6ebcf)\n\n[7504ac78e531762756e8ca8e94adc71fa2179104](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/7504ac78e531762756e8ca8e94adc71fa2179104)\n\n[db8cc8adc726c3567b639c84ecf41aa5](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/db8cc8adc726c3567b639c84ecf41aa5)\n\n\n**Yara Rules for Katana:**\n\n**Mitigation for Katana:**\n\nIt is the ISP level filtering of all traffic that may come from abroad, except for the traffic\nthat will come from abroad and which does not make sense to be blocked (Search\nengine traffic, etc.).\nAttacks from within the country are generally low. Potential amplifier IP addresses that\ncan use for high-dimensional DDoS attacks should be uploaded to the security wall /\nIPS systems in a list and activated in monitoring mode.\n\n## How the Cyber-war Escalating Between Russia and Ukraine as Conflict Became Brutal?\n\nIn addition to recent interventions, Russia’s cyberattacks against Ukraine date back to\nearlier times.\n\nThe cyber warfare between Russia and Ukraine is a part of the confrontation which goes\nback to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russian cyberwar capabilities had been\navailable since 2005 with Uroburos. The first recorded Russian cyberattacks against\nUkraine happened during the mass protests in 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn an operation called Armageddon, a Russian campaign of systematic cyber espionage on\nthe information systems of law enforcement and defense agencies started to help Russia\non the battlefield.\n\nIn 2014, DDoS attacks and cyber espionage were common during the Crimea Crisis. On\nDecember 23, 2015, a cyber-attack on Ukraine’s power grid resulted in power outages for\nroughly 230,000 consumers in the country for 1-6 hours. The attack is attributed to a\nRussian APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group known as “Sandworm.” The mass supplychain attack 2017 using Petya was the most potent known hacker attack according to the\nUS Presidential Administration.\n\nTherefore, cyber warfare was always part of the contemporary Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a\nresult, it was not a surprise that the special cyber activity reports came just hours before\nRussian forces began the invasion of neighboring Ukraine.\n\nWhat to Do to Mitigate Potential Impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian Cyber Crisis?\n\nSince there is no single attack vector or a new type of malware used in the Russian –\n**Ukrainian cyberattacks, there is no single way of protecting your organization against**\ncritical cyber threats in the escalating cyber crisis.\n\nCountries that make quick statements about their side in the conflict are the first to be\ntargeted in global political crises. It can be predicted that cyberattacks from Russia will\nincrease in the coming days. Against potential attacks, SOCRadar’s recommendations are\nas follows:\n\nCyberattacks could come in various forms and have disastrous effects on your organization.\nTo minimize risk and protect your organization, analysts at SOCRadar suggest you to:\n\n**Accelerate Incident Response: Reducing incident response time is crucial for**\norganizations to mitigate the potential consequences. Alert your SOC team, implement a\nmitigation action plan in case of a cyber-attack, and test your communication and backup\nprotocols.\n\n**Update and Patch Software in Endpoints: Unpatched vulnerabilities could be exploited to**\ngain access and damage your organization in any way possible, so it is crucial to update\nand patch critical software in your organization’s endpoints. It is suggested that all software\nbe updated to the latest release.\n\n**Backup Your Data in case of a Ransomware Attack or Data-wiping: The new**\nHermeticWiper malware has targeted organizations in Ukraine and destroyed\norganizations’ data without leaving any chance of recovery. It is strongly suggested that all\nsensitive and important data is backed up, and recovery and backup protocols are\nthoroughly tested to quickly recover from data-wiping and ransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe vast majority of ransomware attacks that have affected almost every country in the last\ntwo years are originated in Russia. To be protected from these attacks, it is essential to\nregularly check the attack surface that is open to the internet and regularly scan it for critical\nvulnerabilities.\n\nOne of the main ways to protect from malware and ransomware attacks is using EDR/EPP\nsoftware. We recommend that you monitor your infrastructure against cyber operations\n[carried out by integrating IOCs shared by SOCRadar into SIEM, XDR, and EDR systems.](https://socradar.io/what-is-extended-detection-and-response-xdr/)\n\n**Scan your Endpoints to Detect Anomalies: Any unclosed RDP (Remote Desktop**\nProtocol) ports along with compromised credentials could seriously damage your\norganization’s infrastructure and result in an unrecoverable cyberattack. It is strongly\nsuggested that security scans and tests are carried out to detect anomalies in your\nendpoints and prevent potential cyberattacks.\n\n**Be aware of DDoS attacks: As the conflict continues and more countries declare their side**\n[in this conjuncture, it will be inevitable for DDoS attacks to head towards other countries](https://socradar.io/the-rising-threat-in-the-financial-industry-ddos-attacks/)\nand their critical infrastructures. In such cases, we recommend preparing a “Plan B” for\ncompanies/institutions in regions where the attack is likely to escalate to be activated at the\ntime of the attack.\n\nThe first item of your “Plan B” should be filtering at the ISP level of all traffic, except for the\ntraffic that will come from abroad and does not make sense to be blocked (Traffic that\ncomes from search engine traffic, etc.).\n\nThe attacks that may come from within your country are generally low-level. The potential\n[“amplifier IP addresses” that can be used for high-dimensional DDoS attacks should be](https://socradar.io/how-to-detect-if-your-ip-addresses-are-being-used-in-dht-networks/)\nuploaded to the firewall/IPS systems in a list. These should be activated in monitoring\nmode.\n\nSOCRadar observes that many social media accounts and domain purchases are made for\nphishing and disinformation purposes. In this context, if SOC teams are using it, we\n[recommend DNS monitoring solutions or following such newly acquired domains in](https://socradar.io/suites/attack-surface-management/dns-monitoring/)\nmonitoring mode via SIEM. Finally, we also recommend following the CERTs and\nnewsletters issued by CISA.\n\n\n-----",
