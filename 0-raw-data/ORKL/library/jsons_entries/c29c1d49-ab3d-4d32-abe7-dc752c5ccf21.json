Commands to\nthe remote system, and often\nthe results of those\ncommands, will be embedded\nwithin the protocol traffic\nbetween the client and server.\n\nProtocols such as HTTP and\nHTTPS that carry web traffic\nmay be very common in\nenvironments. HTTP/S\npackets have many fields and\nheaders in which data can be\nconcealed. An adversary may\nabuse these protocols to\ncommunicate with systems\nunder their control within a\nvictim network while also\nmimicking normal, expected\ntraffic.\n\n\n[M1031 - Network](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031)\nIntrusion Prevention:\n\nNetwork intrusion\ndetection and\nprevention systems\nthat use network\nsignatures to identify\ntraffic for specific\nadversary malware\ncan be used to\nmitigate activity at the\nnetwork level.\n\n\n[T1573 – Encrypted Channel:](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/)\n\nAdversaries may employ a\nknown encryption algorithm to\nconceal command and control\ntraffic rather than relying on any\ninherent protections provided by\na communication protocol.\nDespite the use of a secure\nalgorithm, these implementations\nmay be vulnerable to reverse\nengineering if secret keys are\nencoded and/or generated within\nmalware samples/configuration\nfiles.\n\n\n[M1031 - Network Intrusion](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031)\nPrevention:\n\nNetwork intrusion detection\nand prevention systems that\nuse network signatures to\nidentify traffic for specific\nadversary malware can be\nused to mitigate activity at the\nnetwork level.\n\n\n-----\n\n[M1020 - SSL/TLS Inspection:](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1020)\n\nSSL/TLS inspection can be used\nto see the contents of encrypted\nsessions to look for networkbased indicators of malware\ncommunication protocols.\n\n[T1219 – Remote Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219/)\nSoftware:\n\nAn adversary may use legitimate\ndesktop support and remote\naccess software, such as Team\nViewer, Go2Assist, LogMein,\nAmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish\nan interactive command and\ncontrol channel to target systems\nwithin networks. These services\nare commonly used as legitimate\ntechnical support software, and\nmay be allowed by application\ncontrol within a target\nenvironment.\n\n[M1037 - Filter Network Traffic:](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037)\n\nProperly configure firewalls,\napplication firewalls, and proxies\nto limit outgoing traffic to sites\nand services used by remote\naccess tools.\n\n[M1031 - Network Intrusion](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031)\nPrevention:\n\nNetwork intrusion detection and\nprevention systems that use\nnetwork signatures may be able\nto prevent traffic to remote\naccess services.\n\n\n[M1038 - Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038)\nPrevention:\n\nUse application control to\nmitigate installation and use\nof unapproved software that\ncan be used for remote\naccess.\n\n\n-----\n\nExfiltration [T1567.002 – Exfiltration Over](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002/)\nWeb Service: Exfiltration to\nCloud Storage:\n\nAdversaries may exfiltrate\ndata to a cloud storage\nservice rather than over their\nprimary command and control\nchannel.
