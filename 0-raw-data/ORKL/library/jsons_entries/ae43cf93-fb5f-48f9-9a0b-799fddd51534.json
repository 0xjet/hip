Some “manufactured videos” depicting Italians singing “thank\nyou, China” from their balconies have circulated online, for example. Chinese efforts to\n\n\n-----\n\nspread disinformation about the pandemic have also included campaigns questioning the\norigin of the coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in China, and cracking down\non dissent online, according to CrowdStrike.\n\nSocial media bots, which have alphanumeric handles and were dormant for long periods\nbefore spreading pro-China messages, have recently amplified official Chinese posts, such\nas those from Chinese embassies, Meyers added.\n\n“That’s pretty much a red flag in terms of influence operations on [platforms] like Twitter,”\nMeyers said.\n\n\n-----",
