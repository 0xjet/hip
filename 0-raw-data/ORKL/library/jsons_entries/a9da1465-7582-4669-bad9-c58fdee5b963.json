This malicious RTF file takes advantage of the vulnerability CVE-20151641. Upon successful exploitation, it drops a malware in the %appdata%\\Microsoft\ndirectory. To evade suspicion by the victim, it also drops a decoy document which shows the\nsymbol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan on the first page, but on the next pages\nshows an article about the Senate of Pakistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoy document\n\nAs we were unable to identify which malware family the dropped malware belongs to, we\ntried to dig a bit further. Our analysis exposed that this is a new variant of a malware dubbed\nas [BADNEWS, which is actively being used in the MONSOON APT campaign. This variant](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Software/S0128)\nsteals documents from USB drives.\n\nThe first thing we wanted to learn is if there were other files similar to this malicious RTF file\nthat had been submitted to VirusTotal after the discovery of the APT campaign was first\npublished in August 2016. A quick similar-to: search in VirusTotal provided 3 results:\n\nVT similar-to: search gives 3 similar malicious RTF files\n\nIt looks very similar to file that was submitted to VirusTotal on 11/08/2016 with file name\n“Who_would_win_an_all_out_war_between_Pakistan_and_India.doc,” and another one\nsubmitted on 03/08/2017 with the file name “Jobs.” Executing the files reveals that the first\nhas a theme similar to the initially discovered file, while the other looks like a United Nations\ncareer opportunities guide document. All of them drop the same malware, with only small\ncode variations.\n\n## Malicious RTF\n\nIn this blog we will just run a quick analysis of the malicious RTF shellcode, as our colleague\n[Wayne already did an in-depth analysis of CVE-2015-41 here. RTFScan tells us that there](https://blog.fortinet.com/2015/08/20/the-curious-case-of-the-document-exploiting-an-unknown-vulnerability-part-1)\nare 4 objects in this RTF file, and dumps these objects as separate files.\n\n\n-----\n\nObject 2 contains a zip file with “PK” header, which is obviously an embedded OLE\ndocument. When you extract the contents of this OLE object, we notice that it contains 2\nactiveX.bin files (activeX1.bin and activeX2.bin)\n\nThe first contains the first-stage shellcode. The second contains the second-stage shell\ncode, the malware, and decoy document.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe attached winword.exe to a debugger and opened the malicious RTF file to see what the\nshellcode does. As seen below, the first stage shellcode searches for the marker\n0xC24350D1 in the activeX2.bin file, then allocates memory where it copies 0x88F bytes\nafter the marker. The copied data is the second-stage shell code, and is decrypted using\nSUB 0x37 on each byte. After decryption, the second shell code is called.\n\nThe second stage shellcode uses hardcoded offsets to locate the encrypted files.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter decrypting the first file using SUB 0x37 on each byte, it drops the file as\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Templates\\msvcrt.dll. It then drops the file ~Normal.dat in the same\ndirectory that contains the encrypted decoy document and the malware, along with other\nlegitimate files. The file msvcrt.dll is loaded using LoadLibraryW(). The shellcode then cleans\nup the registry in HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\1{0-6}.0\\Word\\Resiliency to prevent\nwarning messages when someone re-opens a document that has crashed previously.\n\nThe msvcrt.dll file loads the ~Normal.dat file in memory. The decoy document is first\ndecrypted using the same decryption algorithm, and is dropped as\n%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\.doc. It is started using hidden cmd.exe /c start .\n\nThe following files are also decrypted from ~Normal.dat file using the algorithm XOR 0x41,\nSUB 0x7 on each byte, and are dropped in the %appdata%\\Microsoft directory as:\n\nMicroScMgmt.exe\n\nmsvcr71.dll\n\njli.dll\n\nThe file MicroScMgt.exe is then executed using CreateProcessA(). The file jli.dll contains the\nmalware dubbed as BADNEWS. BADNEWS was the name given to this malware as it uses\nnews sites and blogs to obtain its C&C servers.\n\n## BADNEWS Backdoor\n\nBADNEWS uses a DLL side-loading technique with a signed Java executable to evade the\nHost Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) of security programs that monitor the behaviors of\nexecuted files. Most HIPS tools whitelist signed or trusted files. This technique is reminiscent\nof the PlugX backdoor technique because it also piggybacked on signed legitimate files to\nexecute the PlugX backdoor.\n\nMicroScMgmt.exe is a renamed version of java-rmi.exe, the legitimate Java Runtime\nexecutable version 6.0.390.4. This file needs to load the legitimate DLLs msvcr71.dll and\njli.dll to import some functions. However, the dropped jli.dll file here is crafted to contain the\nBADNEWS code.\n\nAll functions exported by this jli.dll file point to a single routine, which is the malware code, so\nupon execution of the MicroScMgmt.exe file one of these functions will be called, effectively\ncalling the malware code.\n\n\n-----\n\nExport functions point to malware code\n\n## Anti-Analysis Techniques\n\nThe malicious DLL file is not packed,but is obfuscated to deter analysis.\n\n## Anti-sandbox/emulator\n\nA long loop has been added before it performs its malicious routines. Many sandboxes and\nemulators only run for a certain short period of time until they time-out, so malware behavior\nusually are not captured when malware goes in a long loop before it performs its routines. An\nemulator, though, that can patch files it tries to emulate, can easily bypass long loops.\n\nLong loop as anti-sandbox/emulator\n\n## Reversed, Garbage, and Encrypted Strings\n\n\n-----\n\nBADNEWS has a lot of reversed, garbage, and encrypted strings. However, the string\nencryption is just a simple minus 1 on each byte.\n\n## API resolution\n\nTraversing the export table to get the API address is an old technique used by malware, but\nif a malware like BADNEWS does this, most of the time it calls a Windows API without any\nfunction for it. That could be very annoying to analyze, as manually setting the type of\nvariables is needed in IDA for each resolution in order to get proper decompilation.\n\nLoadLibraryA() is resolved twice\n\n## Auto-Start Mechanism\n\nThis malware creates the following registry entry, so it starts when the machine reboots.\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nJUSCHED = %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\MicroScMgmt.exe\n\n## Creates Threads\n\nBADNEWS backdoor also creates 2 threads. One performs key-logging, and the other one\nsteals documents from USB drives.\n\n## Key-logging\n\nThe first thread creates a hidden window to log keystrokes, and saves them to a file named\n%temp%\\TPX498.dat.\n\n\n-----\n\nHidden window creation\n\nWhen the window procedure is called, the function checks to see if the message the window\nreceived is WM_LBUTTONDOWN. This means the user presses the left mouse button, and\nthis is when it starts to log keystrokes.\n\nThe file TPX498.dat starts with the marker “K L T N M :  Appdat” followed by the keyboard\nlayout code which signifies the language. The rest is a list of information about the captured\nkeystrokes. The information contains the date when the keystrokes were captured, the\nwindow title, and the keys pressed while on the window. In the example below, the language\ncode is 0x0409, which means English – US. It shows that the user left-clicked on the window\nwith title Temp (active window is Windows explorer, the user is exploring the %temp%\ndirectory,) which started the keylogging routine.\n\nTPX498.dat file contains the logged keystrokes\n\n## Stealing Documents from USB Drives\n\nThe second thread again creates a hidden window to monitor when a new USB device is\nadded to the machine. It does this by first checking to see if the message received by the\nwindow is WM_DEVICECHANGE.\n\nDevice change detection\n\n\n-----\n\nIt then sends the IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY control code to all volume\ndevices. The devices should return a STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR data containing\nthe BusType. If the BusType is BusTypeUsb (0x07), the thread then knows that the new\ndevice is a USB drive, and the stealing routine is called.\n\nBusType should be BusTypeUsb to enable stealing of documents\n\nThe function then creates a folder named “SMB” in the %temp% folder and creates a folder\nwith the following name format,where it stores the stolen files for each USB drive it tries to\nsteal documents from.\n\nEx.\n\nThe files in the USB drive are then checked to find documents to steal. The documents it\ntries to steal have the following extension names, with file size less than 15MB:\n\n\n-----\n\nEarlier variants also steal files with extension names .xls, .xlsx, .rtf, .zip, .7z, .rar.\n\nThe following files are created in the SMB folder:\n\nThe MUT.dat file looks like a dummy file, and is not used. TZ0000001.dat contains filenames\nand file sizes found in the USB drive. If the file size is greater than 15 MB, or the file doesn’t\nhave the file extension above, it will mark it as “HUGE:” so it will not be stolen. Otherwise, a\n0 will be appended following the file name.\n\nThe file TZ0000002.dat contains a list of files to be stolen. Files with file name with random\nalphanumeric characters without extension names are actually copies of the files it tries to\nsteal. When opened, a file contains the file path and the contents of the file.\n\n## Command and Control Communication\n\n\n-----\n\nBADNEWS backdoor has a bit of an interesting way of getting an updated C&C server. It\nuses legitimate web services like Github, Dynamic DNS, RSS feed, blog, and forum websites\nto host encrypted data that contains the actual C&C server. Below are the hardcoded URLs\nwhere the encrypted data is hosted:\n\nhxxp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.php?feedid=49321\n\nhxxp://feed43.com/0414303388550176.xml\n\nhxxps://r0nald2017.wordpress.com/2017/02/16/my-first-post/\n\nhxxps://github.com/r0nald2017/project1/blob/master/xml.xml\n\nr0b1n.crabdance.com\n\nr0nald.ignorelist.com\n\nThis technique does not just make it easy to update the C&C server, but also so that security\nvendors can’t proactively block the hardcoded URLs since they point to legitimate services.\n\nEncrypted C&C server information hosted in Github\n\nThe above data is encrypted by performing ROR by 3 bits and XOR by 0x23 on each byte,\nconverting the result to hexadecimal representation and lastly encode it with base64. When\ndecrypted, the real C&C URL is revealed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&C server is written to the file %temp%\\TZ90.dat as a backup in case the URLs\nembedded in the malware body are already down.\n\nAfter obtaining the C&C URL, this backdoor generates a unique identifier for the machine\nusing a value from GetTickCount() and prepares a message containing the generated UID,\nsystem information and the malware version:\n\nThe UID is saved in the file %temp%\\T89.dat so the same UID will be used every time it\ncontacts the C&C server. The malware version seems to be bogus though, as earlier variants\nfound in 2015 also use v=2.2 ]which is hardcoded in the malware body. Username and\ncomputer name are in Unicode and in hexadecimal representation.\n\nThis message is encrypted using the above encryption algorithm before it is sent to the C&C\nserver via HTTP POST. To further obfuscate the message, it splits it into several bogus fields\nwith randomly generated names so it looks like a normal query string.\n\nHTTP POST data contains bogus fields\n\n## Commands\n\nOne of things that makes BADNEWs backdoor a bit difficult to analyze, as with other bots, is\nthat the server doesn’t always respond. It took us 1.5 weeks of monitoring to finally get a\nresponse. However, it looks like the bad guy manually controls the C&C every time it\nbecomes active. The moment we got a response, the bad guy issued a command to capture\na screenshot, which was sent back to him. After that, we got a “403 Forbidden” response. It\nalso looks like the IP address that was used during monitoring was blocked.\n\nCommands received from the server have the format :. Encrypted data uses the above\nencryption algorithm, and can contain a URL where a file is downloaded, or a file path to\nupload to the C&C server, or a command for the remote shell.\n\n\n-----\n\n“snp”: command to take screen shot then send to C&C\n\nBelow are the commands found in the malware body, along with their descriptions:\n\nCommand Description\n\nshell Download a file and save it as %temp%\\up\n\nlink Download a file, save it as %temp%\\up<2 random characters>.exe or\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\mmln<2 random letters>.exe, and\nexecute it\n\nmod Download a DLL (possibly a plugin), save it as\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\mmln.dll or %temp%\\up<2 random characters>.dll (this\nis not immediately loaded – a function will load it when the malware restarts)\n\nupd Download a file (possibly an updated copy), and save it as %temp%\\up.exe\n\ndwd Create an empty file in the %temp% named TY10.dat and send it to C&C\n\nkl Send the file %temp%\\TPX498.dat that contains the logged keys to C&C\n\nsnp Take a screenshot, save it as %temp%\\TPX499.dat, and send it to C&C\n\nustr Send stolen documents saved in the %temp%\\SMB folder to C&C\n\nsdwl Send specified file to C&C\n\nutop Disable sending of stolen documents to C&C\n\nhcmd Remote shell using hidden cmd.exe, pipe the output to\n%temp%\\DMCZ0000.dat, then send it to C&C\n\n{{ Decrypt the data inside {{ }} and use it as C&C URL. This is similar to the way\nit initially obtained the C&C from legitimate web services.\n\n\n-----\n\nok Do nothing\n\nFor the commands where this malware needs to send a file to the C&C, there are 4\nmessages it sends to the C&C. If it’s not sending a file, it sends just the last one, signifying\nthat a command has been performed. Below are the 4 messages, in the order of when they\nare sent. The “tt” parameter contains the file.\n\n“&tt” field contains the file it uploads\n\nHere are some interesting observations about the how the commands were implemented.\nFirst, it looks like for the commands “mod” and “upd” the author intends to execute the\ndownloaded files, but there’s a bug in the code where LoadLibraryA() function is called.\nInstead of passing the path of the downloaded file as a parameter, it passes the contents of\nthe file, therefore LoadLibraryA() sets the error ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND. For the\ncommands “link”, “mod”, and “upd”, if the malware fails to create the files they are executed\nusing process hollowing. The file downloaded using the command “shell” is not executed,\nhowever the remote shell can be used to execute it manually by the attacker.\n\n## Hidden CMD\n\nWhen this backdoor receives the “hcmd” command, it creates a hidden “cmd.exe” process.\nThis hidden cmd.exe acts as a remote shell that uses the standard input and output to pipe\nthe commands from the C&C server to the cmd.exe, and the output to a created file in\n%temp% folder named DMCZ0000.dat.\n\n\n-----\n\nHidden cmd.exe process\n\nTo better understand how this works, Microsoft published an article describing how to create\na child process with redirected input and output.\n\n[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682499(v=vs.85).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682499(v=vs.85).aspx)\n\nThe DMCZ0000.dat file is then sent to the C&C server.\n\nDMCZ000.dat contains cmd.exe output\n\nIn [part 2 of our analysis, we will try to discover who might be behind the distribution of these](http://blog.fortinet.com/2017/04/05/in-depth-look-at-new-variant-of-monsoon-apt-backdoor-part-2)\nmalicious files.\n\n-= FortiGuard Lion Team =\n### Related Posts\n\nCopyright © 2022 Fortinet, Inc.
