    "plain_text": "# Palestine-Aligned Hackers Use New NimbleMamba Implant in Recent Attacks\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/02/palestinian-hackers-using-new.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/palestinian-hackers-using-new.html)**\n\nFebruary 8, 2022\n\nAn advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group operating with motives that likely align with\nPalestine has embarked on a new campaign that takes advantage of a previously undocumented\nimplant called NimbleMamba.\n\nThe intrusions leveraged a sophisticated attack chain targeting Middle Eastern governments,\n[foreign policy think tanks, and a state-affiliated airline, enterprise security firm Proofpoint said in a](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ugg-boots-4-sale-tale-palestinian-aligned-espionage)\nreport, attributing the covert operation to a threat actor tracked as Molerats (aka TA402).\n\nNotorious for continuously updating their malware implants and their delivery methods, the APT\n[group was most recently linked to an espionage offensive aimed at human rights activists and](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/molerats-hackers-hiding-new-espionage.html)\njournalists in Palestine and Turkey, while a previous attack exposed in June 2021 resulted in the\n[deployment of a backdoor called LastConn.](https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/molerats-hackers-return-with-new.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nBut the lull in the activities has been offset by the operators actively working to retool their arsenal,\nresulting in the development of NimbleMamba, which is designed to replace LastConn, which, in\n[turn, is believed to be an upgraded version of another backdoor called SharpStage that was used](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/molerats-apt-new-malware-and-techniques-in-middle-east-espionage-campaign)\nby the same group as part of its campaigns in December 2020.\n\n\"NimbleMamba uses guardrails to ensure that all infected victims are within TA402's target region,\"\nthe researchers said, adding the malware \"uses the Dropbox API for both command-and-control as\nwell as exfiltration,\" suggesting its use in \"highly targeted intelligence collection campaigns.\"\n\nAlso delivered is a trojan dubbed BrittleBush that establishes communications with a remote server\nto retrieve Base64-encoded commands to be executed on the infected machines. What's more, the\nattacks are said to have occurred in tandem with the aforementioned malicious activity targeting\nPalestine and Turkey.\n\nThe infection sequence mirrors the exact same technique used by the threat actor to compromise\nits targets. The spear-phishing emails, which act as the starting point, contain geofenced links that\nlead to malware payloads — but only if the recipient is in one of the targeted regions. If the targets\n\n\n-----\n\nlive outside of the attack radius, the links redirect the user to a benign news website like Emarat Al\nYoum.\n\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nHowever, more recent variations of the campaign in December 2021 and January 2022 have\ninvolved the use of Dropbox URLs and attacker-controlled WordPress sites to deliver malicious\nRAR files containing NimbleMamba and BrittleBush.\n\nThe development is the latest example of adversaries using cloud services, such as Dropbox, to\nlaunch their attacks, not to mention how quickly sophisticated actors can respond to public\ndisclosures of their invasion methods to create something potent and effective that can go past\nsecurity and detection layers.\n\n\n-----\n\nTA402 continues to be an effective threat actor that demonstrates its persistence with its highly\ntargeted campaigns focused on the Middle East,\" the researchers concluded. \"The [two] campaigns\ndemonstrate Molerats' continued ability to modify their attack chain based on their intelligence\ntargets.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
