Dripion is custom-built, designed to steal information, and has been used\nsparingly in a limited number of targeted attacks. The attackers behind this campaign went to\nsome lengths to disguise their activities, including using domains names disguised as antivirus\n(AV) company websites for their command and control (C&C) servers. These attacks have\nsome links to earlier attacks by a group called Budminer involving the Taidoor Trojan\n[(Trojan.Taidoor).](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-072816-0504-99)\n\n|Jon_DiMaggio|Symantec Employee|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nsecurity. Unknown threats may evade signature-based detection, but can be blocked by other\ndetection tools which identify malicious behavior.\n\n**Background**\nOur investigation began when we received three file hashes, which we determined to have the\nfunctionality of a back door with information-stealing capabilities. The malware appeared to be\nnew, rarely detected, and not publicly available. As we analyzed the binary and compared it\nagainst other known back door Trojans, we realized this was custom-developed malware.\n\nDeveloping a back door with information-stealing capabilities designed to evade detection\nrequires both knowledge and funding. Usually when we see a new back door Trojan like this, it\nis tied to organizations involved in cyberespionage campaigns.\n\n**Malware downloader**\nOne of the first steps taken when investigating malware is to determine how it is getting onto a\nvictim’s computer. Many publicly available downloaders exist; however, only a few unique\ndownloaders have been used over the past few years that have been exclusive to\ncyberespionage activity. Since Dripion appeared to be used by a single attacker against a\nsmall target group, we wanted to determine if the downloader could provide additional\nevidence to help attribute the threat to any known threat groups.\n\n[The downloader was identified as Downloader.Blugger (MD5:](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-030106-5750-99)\n260f19ef39d56373bb5590346d2c1811). It is not a new piece of malware, having been in\nexistence since at least 2011. How the victim was infected with Blugger is currently unknown.\n\nBlugger used encryption to make its infrastructure and commands queried in the URL requests\nharder to detect. After decrypting however, we identified the following URL requests:\n\nhttp://classic-blog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com/nasyzk/20002630\nhttp://nasyzk.[REDACTED DOMAIN 2].net/blog/post/251315428\n\nBoth of the domains we analyzed in the URLs requested by the downloader are publicly\naccessible blogs. The downloader contacts these blog URLs in order to retrieve Dripion for\ninstallation.\n\nThe blog posts are primarily in English yet most of the targets are based in Taiwan. As\nillustrated in Figure 1, one of the blogs references US healthcare spending. It is unknown if\nthe attacker created the blog or simply compromised another to use in their attacks. If the blog\nwas compromised, then the attacker likely would not create posts themselves as it would show\nthe blog’s creator that something was awry. If the blog was created by the attacker, it may be\nan attempt to develop a blog with topics that would likely be of interest to the intended target.\nMost of the blogs were related to news events.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Screenshot of one of the blogs used to infect the victim with Dripion malware_\n\n**The Dripion back door Trojan**\nOnce Dripion is installed, the attacker can access the user’s computer. Dripion has the\nfunctionally of a back door Trojan, letting attackers upload, download, and steal predetermined information from the victim, and execute remote commands. Information such as\nthe victim’s computer name and IP address are automatically transmitted to the C&C server\nupon the initial infection.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nGoSleep Sleeps for 10 minutes\n\nGoKill Attempts to delete itself and ends its activities\n\nGoBye Disconnects from the computer\n\nnodata Similar to GoBye\n\nCommand Execute command (lpCommandLine in CreateProcessA), redirect result through pipe to .tmp\nfile and Download file\n\nUpFile Write data in file on victim's computer\n\nDownFile Write data to a remote open file (InternetWriteFile). The .tmp file used may be deleted after\nsuccess operation.\n\nExecuteFile Create a new process (CreateProcessA)\n\n_Table 1. Commands associated with the Dripion malware_\n\n\n-----\n\nconfiguration file (XOR: 0xA8) as well as network requests with the C&C server (XOR: 0xA3),\nto make detection more difficult.\n\nDripion has been identified in multiple variations and has version numbers hardcoded within\nthe malware. This indicates that the attackers have the ability to both create and develop their\nown custom malware as well as update their code to provide new capabilities and make\ndetection more difficult.\n\n**Ties to previous cyberespionage activity**\nThe use of publicly accessible blogs to distribute malware is a tactic we have seen previously,\nbut few cyberespionage groups have used this technique. Fewer still have used this strategy\nto deliver custom-developed malware not often seen in the wild.\n\nThe first piece of evidence pointing towards a link with previous cyberespionage campaigns\nwas the use of the Blugger downloader, which has only been used by a group Symantec calls\nBudminer. This group has used Blugger to distribute its own custom malware known as\n[Taidoor (Trojan.Taidoor). Symantec has previously written about Budminer’s Taidoor](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-072816-0504-99)\ncampaigns. Significantly, this is the first time we have seen Blugger used to deliver malware\nother than Taidoor.\n\nFurther investigation uncovered a second tie with earlier Budminer activity. One of the Blugger\nsamples associated with Dripion connected with a root domain also used in Taidoor-related\nactivity.\n\n_Figure 2. Dripion and Taidoor share ties with the same root domain._\n\nBoth of the URL queries originated from the Blugger downloader which connected to the blog\nclassic-blog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com. They then call out to subdomains of the domain\n\n[REDACTED DOMAIN 3].net. Both Dripion and Taidoor not only connected to the same\n\n\n-----\n\nblog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com /nasyzk/[ENCODED TEXT]) to obtain the encrypted C&C\nconfiguration.\n\n**Targeting**\nSymantec first identified activity involving Dripion in September 2015. Based on the timestamp\nof the earliest known sample however, Dripion may have been in existence since 2013. The\nDripion activity that we have analyzed is extremely targeted and has involved far fewer victims\ncompared to the number of users infected with Taidoor.\n\n_Figure 3. Detection of unique Dripion and Taidoor file hashes by region_\n\nThe similarity between the two sets of activity is the number of unique file hashes found\ninfecting users located in Taiwan.\n\nUnfortunately, we need more data to determine if the timestamps associated with Dripion\ndating back to November 2013 (7ad3b2b6eee18af6816b6f4f7f7f71a6) are legitimate or if they\nhave been forged. The earliest known Dripion activity we were able to validate took place in\nNovember 2014. Despite the one-year gap in activity, it is possible that campaigns involving\nDripion happened during this period and went undetected due to its small target window.\n\nAnother interesting tactic used to deceive potential targets lies within the C&C infrastructure.\nThe attackers created multiple domains with names similar to that of legitimate companies and\nwebsites in the antivirus community. For example the domains hyydn.nortonsoft[.]com and\nmhysix.mcfeesoft[.]com were both C&C domains used in attacks. Using typo-squat domains to\nmimic legitimate sites is a tactic frequently used to trick the targets as well as defenders, in an\neffort to make the domains blend in with normal activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe began this investigation with what we believed was a new campaign using an unidentified\nback door Trojan against targets primarily in Taiwan. As the investigation grew we found\nmultiple ties between this newly discovered attack and activity associated with the Budminer\ncyberespionage group:\n\nSame unique downloader (not publicly available and only seen used in China-based\ncyberespionage activity)\nThe unique downloader used by both Dripion and Taidoor encrypts data using the\nvictim's MAC address as the RC4 key\nUse of the same blogs for distribution of malware (Taidoor and Dripion)\nUse of shared C&C infrastructure (at the root domain level)\nSimilar targeting (primary location of targets is Taiwan)\n\nWe compared Dripion against Taidoor malware samples to determine if there was any shared\ncode or if it may have originated from the same developer. Our findings concluded there were\nno similarities between the two malware families. However, the downloader used by both\nmalware families has unique attributes, and we believe it to be from the same developer.\n\nSo what does all this mean? Attribution of cyberespionage groups is difficult and needs to be\ndone carefully based on fact and not assumptions. We have a number of ties between the two\nsets of activity. Not all of the ties are strong on their own, but together provide a strong case\nthat there is a relationship between the groups targeting Taiwan using Dripion and Taidoor\nmalware.\n\nBased on the evidence we have presented Symantec attributed the activity involving the\nDripion malware to the Budminer advanced threat group. While we have not seen new\ncampaigns using Taidoor malware since 2014, we believe the Budminer group has changed\ntactics to avoid detection after being outed publicly in security white papers and blogs over the\npast few years.\n\nThis investigation is just one example of Symantec’s ongoing effort to identify unknown\nemerging threats. By remaining one step ahead of adversaries, we can protect customers with\nintelligence driven security.\n\n**Mitigation advice**\n\nAlways keep your security software up to date to protect yourself against any new\nvariants of this malware.\nKeep your operating system and other software updated. Software updates will\nfrequently include patches for newly discovered security vulnerabilities which are\nfrequently exploited by attackers.\nDelete any suspicious-looking emails you receive, especially if they contain links or\nattachments. Spear phishing emails are frequently used by cyberespionage attackers as\na means of luring victims into opening malicious files.\n\n\n-----\n\nSymantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections:\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**File hashes**\n\n2dd931cf0950817d1bb567e12cf80ae7\n3652075425b367d101a7d6b6ef558c6c\n59ff5624a02e98f60187add71bba3756\n865d24324f1cac5aecc09bae6a9157f5\neca0ef705d148ff105dbaf40ce9d1d5e\nf4260ecd0395076439d8c0725ee0125f\n3652075425b367d101a7d6b6ef558c6c\n285de6e5d3ed8ca966430846888a56ff\n31f83a1e09062e8c4773a03d5993d870\n4438921ea3d08d0c90f2f903556967e5\n7ad3b2b6eee18af6816b6f4f7f7f71a6\nb594d53a0d19eaac113988bf238654d3\nc3e6ce287d12ac39ceb24e08dc63e3b5\ne0c6b7d9bdae838139caa3acce5c890d\ne7205c0b80035b629d80b5e7aeff7b0e\nc182e33cf7e85316e9dc0e13999db45e\n272ff690f6d27d2953fbadf75791274c\nae80f056b8c38873ab1251c454ed1fe9\n260f19ef39d56373bb5590346d2c1811\nFE8D19E3435879E56F5189B37263AB06\n68BEBCD9D2AD418332980A7DAB71BF79\nCBDE79B6BA782840DB4ACA46A5A63467\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nhyydn[.]nortonsoft.com\nmhysix[.]mcfeesoft.com\ngspt[.]dns1.us\nunpt[.]defultname.com\n198.144.100.73\n208.61.229.10\n200.215.222.105\n61.222.137.66\n103.240.182.99\n\n[Tags: Products, Endpoint Protection, Security Response, APT, Backdoor.Dripion,](https://www.symantec.com/connect/search?filters=im_vid_31:691)\n[Cyberespionage, Downloader.Blugger, Taiwan, targeted attacks, Trojan.Taidoor, United](https://www.symantec.com/connect/search?filters=im_vid_111:84571)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
