    "plain_text": "# ‘Shadow Academy’ Targets 20 Universities Worldwide\n\n**[riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/shadow-academy/](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/shadow-academy/)**\n\nDecember 2, 2020\n\nExternal Threat Management Labs\n\nDecember 02, 2020\n\nBy Team RiskIQ\n\nIn early July 2020, RiskIQ began tracking a phishing campaign identified through our internet\nintelligence graph targeting colleges and universities worldwide. From July 2020 into October\n2020, RiskIQ systems uncovered 20 unique targets in Australia, Afghanistan, the UK, and\nthe USA.\n\nAll these attacks used similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as Mabna Institute,\n[an Iranian company that, according to the FBI, was created for illegally gaining access \"to](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/nine-iranians-indicted-by-us-for-hacking-to-steal-research-data/)\nnon-Iranian scientific resources through computer intrusions.\" Mabna Institute earned the\nmoniker \"Silent Librarian\" due to its focused efforts to compromise university students and\n[faculty by impersonating university library resources using domain shadowing to harvest](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/facing-the-darkness-domain-shadowing-is-breaking-the-internet/)\ncredentials.\n\n[However, while RiskIQ's findings are consistent with TTPs in use by Silent Librarian, they](https://community.riskiq.com/article/44eb0802)\nalone are not sufficient to attribute the threat activity we've detected against these 20\nuniversities directly to Mabna Institute. Therefore, RiskIQ has named actors identified during\nthis research as \"Shadow Academy.\"\n\n**37% of the universities were targeted with Library themed attacks.**\n**63% of the universities were targeted with general access or student portal attacks.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**11% of the universities were targeted with financial aid-themed attacks.**\n\n## An Orientation to Shadow Academy\n\nThe first target identified from RiskIQ crawl data was a Louisiana State University (LSU)themed student portal login page. While using PassiveTotal to analyze this resource, it\n[became clear that threat actors were leveraging domain Shadowing, a technique known to](https://community.riskiq.com/research?query=domain%20shadow)\nbe used by Silent Librarian.\n\nDomain shadowing intercepts account traffic flowing to existing, registered, and otherwise\ntrustworthy web domains. First, threat actors steal domain account credentials. They then\nregister unauthorized subdomains to point traffic to malicious servers or, in this case, create\n[phishing pages. These subdomains are challenging to detect because they are associated](https://www.riskiq.com/resources/webinars/subdomain-infringement-unseen-threat-thats-running-rampant/)\nwith well-known domains, often don't follow any discernible pattern, and don't affect the\nparent domain or anything hosted on that domain.\n\n## A Far-reaching Campaign\n\nExpanding on our identification of the initial LSU-imposter domain, we saw that Shadow\nAcademy used this same resource to host similar malicious infrastructure to target three\nother universities, all using certificates that share a distinct pattern.\n\nRiskIQ's internet intelligence graph helped unearth a new batch of compromised domains by\nkeying in on the URL structure and date range of registration. Subdomains created from\nthese domains spanned multiple campaign themes, which focused primarily on credential\nharvesting and financial theft. The credential-harvesting URLs focused mainly on popular\nservices like Amazon, Instagram, and online banking.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Murrez is a Possible Shadow Academy Competitor\n\nDuring this investigation, RiskIQ researchers discovered through RiskIQ crawl data that the\nvocational-technical school azma.edu[.]af, located in Ehsan Azizi, Herat, Afghanistan, had\nbeen defaced by the actor \"Murrez.\"\n\nMany of the tools in Murrez's GitHub account have code comments with references or file\nnames(priv8bruter.pl) connected to a well known Russian cybercrime forum named \"Priv8\". The account contains repositories of compromised database and domain credentials and\nhacking tools related to objectives similar to but not directly attributed to Silent Librarian.\n\nMurrez's \"private-tool\" repository has a Perl-based tool that automates brute force attacks\nand would enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to these resources and facilitate\nthe creation of certificates and shadow domains. Priv-8 facilitates the sharing and selling of\ncompromised datasets, tools, and resources for attackers. Searching for\" .edu\" in one of\nMurrez's dumped databases reveals hundreds of compromised \".edu\" accounts.\n\nMurrez appears to be a member of W4coders, a relatively small hacking collective, possibly\ncomprised of four other actors. According to a site the group uses to rank its successes,\nW4coders has 81 successful compromises ranging from defacement to domain takeover\ndating back to May 2020, many of which are related to education, news media, and, in some\ncases, law enforcement.\n\n## Protect Your Attack Surface\n\nMany college campuses began releasing timelines for on-campus operations in July 2020.\nResearch suggests that Shadow Academy actors timed the development of malicious\ninfrastructure to take advantage of the first few days of class, which can be a chaotic time\nthat overwhelms IT staff.\n\nHowever, having access to the infrastructure that comprises the web helps analysts note\nsimilarities between threat campaigns are observable behavior by threat actors to track them\nto identify and investigate threats during heightened periods of attacker activity.\n\nStarting with the unique data sets in RiskIQ PassiveTotal built upon RiskIQ's Internet\nIntelligence Graph, analysts can quickly enumerate infrastructure related to even seemingly\ndisparate campaigns to paint a vivid picture of the threat landscape targeting their institution.\n\nRiskIQ will continue research efforts to enumerate Shadow Academy infrastructure and\nshare findings.
