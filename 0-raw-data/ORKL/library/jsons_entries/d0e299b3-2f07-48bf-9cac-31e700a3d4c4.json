    "plain_text": "## Trust and trustworthiness of supply chains is an issue confronting communities around the world, including U.S. government agencies and the thousands of commercial enterprises that support them. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought supply chain\nsecurity (SCS) into sharpened focus, and many\ninadequacies have surfaced regarding timely access\nto reliable stocks of personal protective equipment,\nmedical devices, and food supplies, to name a few.\n\nThis is not a new challenge. In the 2000s, many\nU.S. government practices related to supply chain\nlogistics management, dating from the Cold War\nera, were extended into the broader commercial\ninformation and communications technology\n(ICT) marketplace as those technologies and the\nefficiencies they brought to business and government\nbecame key enablers of the information economy.\n\n\n# A COMPREHENSIVE DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH\n\nBy Robert A. Martin\n\n\nFor many suppliers providing the Department of\nDefense with commercial goods, the concept of\na “cleared industry partner” became part of their\nway of life.\n\nAt the same time, the computerization of everything\ngave rise to pervasive cyber threats – including\nthose stemming from vulnerabilities inherent in\nrepurposed software of often dubious provenance.\nFurther complicating this picture is the increasingly\nglobalized nature of service support for ICT systems.\nOur adversaries seek to inject themselves into every\nconceivable stage of technology development, for both\ndisruptive and intelligence objectives.\n\n## Congressional Actions\nSince 2013, Congress has passed several National\nDefense Authorization Acts and laws that contain\nmore than 100 references to supply chain security.\nMany of these still remain to be implemented by\ntheir target agencies. More recently, in 2018, the\nexecutive branch and Congress worked to pass new\nlegislation to improve executive branch coordination,\nsupply chain information sharing, and actions to\naddress supply chain risks. The Federal Acquisition\n[Supply Chain Security Act of 2018 (Title II of Pub.](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/390?link-type=html)\n[L. 115-390), signed into law on December 21,](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/390?link-type=html)\n2018, established the Federal Acquisition Security\nCouncil (FASC). The FASC is an executive branc\nh interagency council, chaired by a senior-level offici\nal from the Office of Management and Budget (OM\nB), and includes representatives from the Gen\neral Services Administration, Department of Hom\neland Security, Office of the Director of Na\ntional Intelligence, Department of Justice, Depart\nment of Defense, and Department of Commerce.\nThis new interagency council, with its multiagency l\neadership and broad mandate for both cyber and S\nCS policy, could become the much-needed c\noordinating mechanism for federal agencie\ns seeking to answer questions about vendo\nr and product trustworthiness.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Supply Chain Security System of Trust (SoT) Framework\nMITRE has been engaged for decades supporting\nthe national and homeland security communities on\nsupply chain risk issues, and working with national\nand international standards organizations. We have\nalso been deeply engaged in projects specifically\nfocusing on supply chain security for ICT systems,\nincluding highly sensitive nuclear and intelligence\nsystems, and the “trustworthiness” of vendors and\nproducts. With today's increased focus on the need\nfor trustworthy supply chains, trustworthy partners,\nand trusted systems globally, a reliable path to an\nactionable understanding of the risks that can impact\ntrustworthiness is essential – and this path must be\nunderstood, shared, and usable at scale.\n\nAs a result, we have developed the Supply Chain\nSecurity System of Trust (SoT) Framework. This\nframework is aimed at defining, aligning, and\naddressing the specific concerns and risks that stand\nin the way of organizations' trusting suppliers, supplies,\nand service providers. More importantly, the framework\noffers a comprehensive, consistent, and repeatable\nmethodology – for evaluating suppliers, supplies, and\nservice providers alike – that is based on our decades\n\n\nof supply chain security experience, deep insights\ninto the complex challenges facing the procurement\ncommunity of interest, and broad knowledge of the\nrelevant standards organizations.\n\n## How it Works\nThe SoT framework is organized into categories that\ninclude suppliers, supplies, and services. It addresses\n12 top-level decisional risk areas associated with\ntrust that agencies and enterprises must evaluate\nand make choices about during the full life cycle of\ntheir acquisition activities. Leveraging the full breadth\nand depth of our expertise, industry efforts, and\ngovernment research, the SoT framework drills down\ninto these 12 top-level risk areas, investigating as\nmany as 76 risk sub-areas by addressing over 400\ndetailed questions. For example, as highlighted in\nFigure 1: Does a supplier make use of a standard\nservice bill of materials—a list of all the serviceable\nparts needed to maintain an asset while it's in\noperation? Is the supplier using high assurance\nand integrity capabilities to track where software\n“supplies/components” came from, who crafted\nthem, and whether it is verified that they have been\nthrough the expected assurance and validation steps\nnecessary to address the risk of malicious taint?\n\n\n**Figure 1. System of Trust, showing key risk areas for suppliers, supplies/components, and services**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the framework draws upon numerous\nvalidated data repositories to advance a probabilistic\nrisk assessment of the trustworthiness of a product,\nservice, or supplier. This SoT analytical system is\npositioned to enable an acquirer to make a clear, wellinformed decision about whether to purchase from a\nparticular entity, and whether to purchase a specific\nitem/part number from that entity. Figure 1 shows a\nhigh-level depiction of the SoT framework.\n\n## How to Apply It\nThe SoT assessment starts with asking a few scoping\nquestions to narrow down the SoT content to something\nappropriate to the product, service, or supplier in\nquestion. This subset will be aligned to the assessing\norganization's assessment focus, resources, available\ntime, and legal authorities, and to its present acquisition\nchallenge. During the evaluation process, subjectspecific questions are posed to establish the presence\nor absence of individual aspects of concern and to align\nwith best practices from government and industry. Risks\nare scored using a set of contextually driven, tailorable,\nweighted measurements that are used as inputs into\n\n\na scoring algorithm. The scoring results are then used\nto identify supplier strengths and weaknesses against\nthe applicable risk categories, enabling an acquirer to\nanalyze and evaluate one or more suppliers' relative\n“trustworthiness” for supplying components or services.\n\n## Early Pilots Show Promising Results\nIn late 2020, we conducted an initial set of pilots\nthat assessed: (1) a set of companies for general\nconcerns, (2) a specific company as a supplier of c\nritical infrastructure systems, (3) a product for use by a s\npecific community within the federal government, and (4\n) an industrial base assessment for an organization d\nependent upon a specific technology and the industry c\napable of supplying it.\n\nThe preliminary results for Pilot 1 are illustrated below\nin Figure 2, an unweighted bar chart depicting the\noverall risk scores for the 11 companies reviewed in\nthe pilot, and in Figure 3, which presents radar plots of\nfive data-driven scores from the supplier risk categories\n(leveraging 52 questions in those areas) for three of the\n11 companies of interest. Figure 4 offers a deeper look\n\n\n**Figure 2. Risk scorecard based on the preliminary System of Trust scoring methodology**\n**for 5 top-level categories and 52 risk measure questions for 26 risk factors**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3. Radar plots of 5 data-driven scores for 3 of the 11 companies reviewed in Pilot 1**\n\n**Figure 4. Specific risk scores for one company involved in Pilot 1, in the form of a radar plot**\n\n\n-----\n\ninto the risk scores that generated the radar plot for one\nof the companies involved in the pilot (Company 10).\n\nThese examples all use data sources the SoT leveraged\nto generate the analytical assessments, which clearly\nshow a larger risk profile for Company 10 compared to\nthe others. This pilot provided a proof of concept that\noffers early evidence of this tool's utility, with deeper and\nbroader analysis to follow as the SoT is completed. The\nother three pilots had similar insights.\n\nIn the next phase of the SoT effort, we will use the full\narray of data sources envisioned and tailor weighting and\nscore contributions to fine-tune the emphasis on specific\nsub-risk areas used in any given assessment. Although\nthe pilots only used a subset of the public, private, and\nrestricted access data sources the SoT is anticipated to\nleverage, we are cataloging and capturing the numerous\nsources of potential utility in conducting such analyses.\n\n## Next Steps and Recommended Actions\nContinued tuning of the Supply Chain Security SoT\nFramework through additional pilots and real-world\napplication is expected to result in enhancements that\nwill position the SoT framework to become the generally\naccepted framework for supply chain security – similar\nto the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\nused in all U.S. businesses, or the globally equivalent\ninternational financial reporting standards (IFRS).\n\nThere are a number of actions that agencies, the newly\norganized FASC, Congress, and industry can take now:\n\nSquare Agencies should explore the application of\nthis framework to their supply chain risks. Thi\ns participation would also enhance the framewor\nk. In addition, data sharing of the results of th\nese assessments between federal agencies sh\nould be explored to strengthen the manageme\nnt of government-wide risks to our nation’s supply chain.\n\n\nSquare The FASC, working under the direction of OMB,\nshould actively examine the use of a comprehensiv\ne framework like the Supply Chain Security S\noT Framework to improve agencies’ supply ch\nain risk management, and move towards adop\nting a consistent, repeatable, data-driven analy\ntical approach for addressing supply chain concerns.\n\nSquare Congress, both in its oversight role and in the\ncontext of future legislation associated wit\nh execution of the Federal Acquisition Supply Cha\nin Security Act of 2018, should consider the potent\nial benefits of having the FASC utilize a comprehen\nsive approach like the Supply Chain Securit\ny SoT Framework.\n\nSquare Industry should support and contribute to the\ncontinued legislative and executive branch effort\ns to better understand and secure our nation’s supp\nly chains. Such actions will encourage companies\nto be conscious of their trust rating if they want t\no do business with the federal government and to\ntake steps to ensure they’re securing their supply\nchain systems.\n\n## About the Author\n**Robert A.
