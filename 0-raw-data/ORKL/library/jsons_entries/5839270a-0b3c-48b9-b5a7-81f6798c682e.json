The newly discovered\ncampaign is directed against targets based in at least 13 nations worldwide\nand leverages authentic documents created by academic, finance and\ndiplomatic centers. ITG05’s infrastructure ensures only targets from a single\nspecific country can receive the malware, indicating the highly targeted\nnature of the campaign.\n\nX-Force tracks ITG05 as a likely Russian state-sponsored group consisting of\nmultiple activity clusters, sharing overlaps with industry-identified threat\nactor groups APT28, UAC-028, Fancy Bear and Forest Blizzard.\n\nThe contents of each lure contain themes relevant to a unique audience\ninterested in research and policy creation. The nature of the lures suggests\nactivity is directed at entities with direct influence on the allocation of\nhumanitarian aid, primarily those based in Europe. Our discovery includes\nmultiple legitimate documents associated with finance, think tanks,\neducational organizations and government and nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs) leveraged as lure materials. These files are featured in larger\n[infection chains associated with the delivery of the ITG05 exclusive Headlace](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5702579)\nbackdoor capable of facilitating multiple malicious actions on objectives.\n\nIt is unclear precisely how many entities were impacted by the campaign, but\nour analysis indicates that organizations in the following countries were\n\n\n-----\n\ntargeted: Hungary, Türkiye, Australia, Poland, Belgium, Ukraine, Germany,\nAzerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Italy, Latvia and Romania. Of note, all\nbut one of the 13 nations featured in the geolocations perimeters for\n[downloading Headlace are United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states#gotoA) [Human Rights Council members.](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/membership)\n\nIt is highly likely the compromise of any echelon of global foreign policy\ncenters may aid officials’ interests with advanced insight into critical\ndynamics surrounding the International Community's (IC) approach to\ncompeting priorities for security and humanitarian assistance.\n\n# Key Findings\n\n  - This is the first known use of the Israel-Hamas conflict by ITG05 to\nconduct campaigns delivering the exclusive Headlace backdoor.\n\n  - The campaign leverages documents associated with the United Nations,\nthe Bank of Israel, the United States Congressional Research Service,\nthe European Parliament, a Ukrainian think tank and an AzerbaijanBelarus Intergovernmental Commission.\n\n  - X-Force observed the deployment of Headlace and secondary payloads\nto be specifically targeted toward at least 13 nations.\n\n  - Some of the uncovered lures are contained in a .RAR archive exploiting\nthe CVE-2023-38831 vulnerability, others use DLL-hijacking to run\nHeadlace.\n\n[• Headlace is a multi-component malware including a dropper, a VBS](https://www.ibm.com/topics/malware)\nlauncher and a backdoor using MSEdge in headless mode to\ncontinuously download secondary payloads, likely to exfiltrate\ncredentials and sensitive information.\n\n# Background\n\n[In early September 2023, CERT-UA reported APT28 was attempting to use](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5702579)\nnew malware named Headlace to access a critical energy infrastructure\nentity in Ukraine. This involved APT28 using the Mockbin and Mocky API\nwebsites to stage malicious archives retrieved by Javascript droppers. In late\n[September 2023, Zscaler published a similar campaign targeting the theft of](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/steal-it-campaign)\nNTLM hashes from victims in Poland, Austria and Belgium by using adultthemed lures and the Mockbin API for data extraction.\n\nIn late 2023, X-Force uncovered eight lure documents created between early\n[August and early December 2023 likely leveraged in phishing campaigns](https://www.ibm.com/topics/phishing)\ncrafted to ultimately distribute ITG05's Headlace backdoor. X-Force research\nconfirmed the majority of the files are directly derived from publicly available\nofficial documents created by the Bank of Israel, the U.S. Congressional\nResearch Service, the United Nations, the European Parliament, the French\ndigital education service Cahier de Prépa and the Ukraine-based Razumkov\nCentre think tank.\n\nThe remaining lures appear to be internal documents belonging to, or\nassociated with, what appears to be legal amendments to a Turkish manual\nregarding technical installations, and interstate agreements facilitated by the\nJoint Intergovernmental Commission between the Republic of Azerbaijan and\n\n\n-----\n\nthe Republic of Belarus on Economic Cooperation. Of note, the majority of\nthe lure documents contents feature news, updates or information regarding\ndevelopments in Ukraine and the Levant.\n\n[The use of official documents as lure material is a departure from previously](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/steal-it-campaign#zscaler-sandbox-coverage)\n[observed ITG05 activity featuring the delivery of the Headlace backdoor,](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/steal-it-campaign#zscaler-sandbox-coverage)\nwhich featured adult-themed material to engender victim engagement. This\nchange in lure content may be indicative of ITG05's increased emphasis on a\nunique target audience whose interests would prompt interaction with\nmaterial impacting emerging policy creation. State-sponsored cyber\ncapabilities will likely continue to be leveraged to furnish domestic decisionmakers with exclusive access to the political resolve and resource priorities of\nthe IC and individual states.\n\n# Analysis: From decoy documents to phishing lures\n\nPreviously, ITG05 operations featuring the Headlace backdoor were\npreceded by numerous decoy documents featuring adult themes. However,\nduring the past month, X-Force observed a change in tactic with the threat\nactor instead also using the decoys as lures to trick users into accessing the\nattachments. The majority of the uncovered lures feature English-language\ntext except for a Turkish language and a single Russian-language document.\nThe text of each of the decoys contains themes that would likely not appear\nas alerting to a unique audience interested in research and policy creation.\nThe following is a selection of uncovered lure documents used in conjunction\nwith Headlace:\n\n**Example lure 1: Letter of invitation to the expert discussion on**\n**the Razumkov Centre**\n\nThe earliest uncovered lure document titled \"Letter of invitation to the expert\ndiscussion on the Razumkov Centre,\" dates from early September 2023 and\nwas first [reported by Google TAG. It leverages a publicly available](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/government-backed-actors-exploiting-winrar-vulnerability/)\ndocument uploaded one day preceding the presentation of the legitimate\nevent hosted by the Razumkov Centre in partnership with the United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID) under the auspices of the\nUSAID/ENGAGE pact. The invitation presents the findings of the paper \"War\nof Attrition: Comparison of Potentials and Assessment of Prospects\" on\ncurrent results of the conflict in Ukraine, combat potentials and policy\napproaches for avoiding stalemate. The campaign is directed at Romaniabased targets based on the geolocation of the targeted download.\n\n[https://images2.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz03NDljZTNmNDk0NmUxMWVlYmMxNDRhZDJiYTFiODhmNQ==](https://images2.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz03NDljZTNmNDk0NmUxMWVlYmMxNDRhZDJiYTFiODhmNQ==)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 1: Lure document \"Letter of invitation to the expert discussion on the\nRazumkov Centre\"\n\n\n-----\n\nNotably, this lure was contained in a .RAR archive exploiting\nCVE-2023-38831. If opened with WinRAR versions below 6.23, the exploit\ncauses Headlace to silently execute if a user tries to open the benign PDF file.\n\n**Example lure 2: SEDE-PV-2023-10-09-1_EN.docx**\n\nUploaded in mid-October 2023, the lure document titled \"SEDE**[PV-2023-10-09-1_EN.docx\" features the publicly available Minutes of the 9](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/SEDE-PV-2023-10-09-1_EN.docx)**\nOctober 2023 meeting of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence of the\nEuropean Parliament.

A\ndeep dive into the different components impacting delivery including the\nabuse of commercial hosting services, multi-stage malware, exploitation, and\ncommand and control are explored in the following sections.\n\n## Abusing commercial hosting services\n\n[In September 2023, CERT-UA reported spear phishing emails containing](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5702579)\nURLs that led recipients to malicious archives hosted on abused, publicly\navailable, commercial infrastructure; like the Mocky and Mockbin APIs and\nthe Infinityfreeapp service.\n\nIn early campaigns, the threat actors used the Mockbin service to deliver\nmalicious ZIP files containing decoy images, as well as a .CMD file which was\nidentified as Headlace malware.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n\nhttps://run.mocky[.]io/v3/027fab50-2478-4dd2-962f-bb525b36810d\n\nhttps://mockbin[.]org/bin/229f6d51-f534-466f-b642-e86811631083/<result_of_whoami>\n\n\nLater, in late October through November 2023, X-Force observed a second\nlegitimate service \"infinityfreeapp.com\" used to host malicious payloads.\n\n[In the same timeframe, CERT-FR reported malicious activity by APT28 that](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/cti/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009/)\nincluded the use of Mocky, Mockbin and infinityfreeapp services in attacks\ntargeting French government systems.\n\nThe threat actor created several subdomains over the course of the\ncampaigns. The phishing URL would contain a unique hardcoded URL\nparameter \"id\". This ID is necessary to be able to download the lure archive\nas well as Headlace's secondary payloads and likely allows ITG05 to track\ninfections through all stages. Once a victim visits the URL and passes the\nbrowser check, the site redirects to its filedwn.php script using the same \"id\"\nparameter. This causes the download of a ZIP file, again containing the\nHeadlace payload. Instead of the Mocky service, the Headlace backdoor uses\nthe hardcoded id parameter to download the next payload via a URL calling\nthe hosted execdwn.php file.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n\nhttps://downloadingdoc[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com/?id=61726832e715-4f79-99e8-1587300c1035\n\nhttps://downloadingdoc[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com/filedwn.php?id=61726832e715-4f79-99e8-1587300c103\n\nhttps://downloadingdoc[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com/execdwn.php?id=61726832e715-4f79-99e8-1587300c1035\n\n\n-----\n\n## Browser checker\n\nBefore payloads are downloaded from the legitimate staging services, a\nJavascript-based browser enumeration script verifies the user agent and in\nsome cases the geolocation of the victim. Different versions of the script are\nused up to three times within a single infection. Infections start with the\nphishing URL, which redirects to the first download site after a first check.\nThere, the second check takes place, which involves a user agent and\ngeolocation check via the \"https://ipapi[.]co/json\" service (see screenshot\nbelow). After a successful lure download, the victim is redirected\nto www.msn.com.\n\n[https://images2.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz0wYTA3YWNlODk0NzAxMWVlYWZmNjA2NTM0ZTVjZmVkZA==](https://images2.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz0wYTA3YWNlODk0NzAxMWVlYWZmNjA2NTM0ZTVjZmVkZA==)\n\nFig. 8: Browser enumeration script verifying a geolocation in Germany,\nbefore dropping an archive payload\n\nAs visible in the screenshot above, the browser script drops one of two\ndifferent payloads, depending on the result of the location check. Should the\nrequest originate from a different country other than the one targeted, ITG05\nwill drop a non-weaponized version of the archive. This version would only\ncontain the benign lure. In the case of the campaign above, it contains a\n.CMD file only faking a Windows update, but without installing the malicious\nHeadlace backdoor.\n\nThis campaign was active from late September until the end of November,\ntargeting Kazakhstan, Hungary, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and\nAzerbaijan. Later campaigns using policy-themed lures employed the same\ntechnique of dropping only benign lures should any of the checks fail.\n\nAfter the successful execution of the Headlace dropper, the backdoor uses a\nsecond download site to stage secondary payloads. These are downloaded in\nMS Edge headless mode, so the corresponding browser scripts check if the\nuser agent contains the string \"edge\". Often the second download site\nperforms another geolocation check:\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://images1.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz0yYzFmODJiMDk0NzAxMWVlOGMzNTAyMzEzYWMzMDJlNA==](https://images1.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz0yYzFmODJiMDk0NzAxMWVlOGMzNTAyMzEzYWMzMDJlNA==)\n\nFig. 9: Browser enumeration script verifying geolocation in Turkey before\ndropping a payload disguised as a .CSS file\n\nX-Force observed large numbers of browser enumeration scripts specifically\ntargeting the following countries:\n\n - Hungary\n\n  - Türkiye\n\n  - Australia\n\n  - Poland\n\n  - Belgium\n\n  - Ukraine\n\n - Germany\n\n  - Azerbaijan\n\n  - Saudi Arabia\n\n - Kazakhstan\n\n  - Italy\n\n  - Latvia\n\n - Romania\n\nLater variants of the enumeration and verification scripts are likely\nimplemented server-side with a specific hardcoded ID, which is provided in\nthe first phishing URL and is required during all later stages as a URL\nparameter.\n\n## Headlace\n\nX-Force observed three possible execution chains implemented by ITG05 for\nexecuting the Headlace malware:\n\n**Execution via WinRAR vulnerability**\n\nIn this chain, a victim is targeted via the CVE-2023-38831 WinRAR\nvulnerability. If the victim has a vulnerable WinRAR application and opens the\narchive, the lure document is presented while the Headlace dropper is\nexecuted in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Execution via DLL hijacking**\n\nThe DLL-hijacking chain involves delivering a legitimate Microsoft Calc.exe\nbinary that is susceptible to DLL-hijacking. This involves the victim clicking\non Calc.exe to load a malicious DLL that is packaged alongside Calc in the\nmalicious archive. The DLL then executes the Headlace CMD dropper file. In\norder to trick victims into running the executable, Calc.exe is renamed and\ncontains whitespace padding before its extension, which may prevent users\nfrom spotting the suspicious .EXE extension.\n\n**Direct Execution**\n\nIn this chain, the threat actor directs the victim to execute the Headlace CMD\ndropper directly by disguising it as a Windows update script and reporting\nfake update status messages in the console.\n\n[Headlace is a new backdoor discovered by CERT-UA in September 2023. It](https://cert.gov.ua/article/5702579)\nconsists of three components: a .CMD dropper, a .VBS launcher and a .BAT\nbackdoor. The initial dropper starts by writing both other components into\nthe %PROGRAMDATA% directory. It then runs the .VBS launcher and after a\nshort timeout it displays the lure as a decoy and deletes its traces from the\ndirectory it was started in.\n\n[https://images1.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz1jMjFmODFjNjk1NWExMWVlODljODEyODVmNzcyMzRjNA==](https://images1.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz1jMjFmODFjNjk1NWExMWVlODljODEyODVmNzcyMzRjNA==)\n\nFig. 10: Headlace dropper script\n\nThe .VBS launcher uses the Wscript.Shell object to execute the .BAT file,\nwhich acts as a backdoor. In regular intervals, it runs msedge in headless\nmode to download another payload from a hardcoded URL, execute it and\nsubsequently delete it:\n\n[https://images4.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz1jN2Q0NzAxODk1NWExMWVlOWIxNjFhMDBjN2Q1YzllYg==](https://images4.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz1jN2Q0NzAxODk1NWExMWVlOWIxNjFhMDBjN2Q1YzllYg==)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 11: Headlace backdoor script\n\nDuring the last campaign, X-Force observed a new infection chain leading to\nHeadlace. The malicious ZIP file would contain several hidden files and only\none visible executable, with a long whitespace-padded filename, in order to\nhide the extension. The binary is a copy of the legitimate calc.exe, which is\nvulnerable to DLL hijacking. Once executed, it searches the current directory\nfor WindowsCodecs.dll, one of the hidden files, and loads it. The DLL's main\nfunction was overwritten to execute the hidden .CMD file that is the Headlace\npayload. By using indirect execution, the malicious activity is more difficult to\ndetect.\n\nAnother variant of Headlace would disguise itself as a Windows update.\nWhen launching the script, right after dropping and launching its malicious\ncomponents, Headlace would print out fake status messages at regular\nintervals, imitating an update mechanism to an untrained user.\n\n[https://images4.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz1lNzFiMzI3Njk0NzAxMWVlOGUwOWMyOTcxYTUyNmNkYg==](https://images4.cmp.optimizely.com/Zz1lNzFiMzI3Njk0NzAxMWVlOGUwOWMyOTcxYTUyNmNkYg==)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 12: Headlace dropper faking a Windows update\n\n\n-----\n\n# Actions on objective\n\nAccording to observations of CERT-UA, once a foothold has been established\non the system, several follow-up payloads are used to capture NTLM\ncredentials or SMB hashes of user accounts and attempt to exfiltrate them\n[via the TOR network. X-Force has observed variants of Nishang's \"Start-](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Utility/Start-CaptureServer.ps1)\nCaptureServer.ps1\" script, which were modified to exfiltrate credentials\n[through Mockbin. This activity was also reported on by Zscaler in the \"Steal-](https://www.zscaler.de/blogs/security-research/steal-it-campaign)\nIt\" campaign. In addition, ITG05 is also known to leverage custom exfiltration\ntools such as Graphite and Credomap.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nX-Force assesses with high confidence that ITG05 will continue to leverage\nattacks against diplomatic and academic centers to provide the adversary\n[with advanced insight into emergent policy decisions. Given recent](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/cti/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009/)\n[operations, ITG05 remains adaptable to changes in opportunity within the](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/cti/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009/)\ncyber threat landscape by exploiting public CVEs and leveraging\ncommercially available infrastructure.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nX-Force recommends all individuals and entities engaged in or informing\npolicy creation to remain in a heightened state of defensive security and to:\n\n  - Stay abreast of newly published exploits likely to be used by APT actors.\n\n  - Hunt for regularly spawned processes containing “msedge --headlessnew --disable-gpu”.\n\n  - Hunt for headless MS Edge processes downloading .CSS files.\n\n  - Monitor for downloaded archives containing .CMD files.\n\n  - Monitor for DLL hijacking via modified WindowsCodecs.dll files.\n\n  - Monitor for filenames containing an unusually large number of\nconsecutive whitespaces.\n\n  - Monitor network traffic for unusual or unsanctioned commercial service\nuse.\n\n  - Monitor for suspicious use of browsers in headless mode.\n\n  - Install and configure endpoint security software.\n\n  - Update relevant network security monitoring rules.\n\n  - Educate staff on the potential threats to the organization.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\nMD5, SHA1, SHA256, File
