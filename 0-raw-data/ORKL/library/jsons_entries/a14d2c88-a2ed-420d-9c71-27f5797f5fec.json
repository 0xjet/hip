(AP\nPhoto/Andrew Harnik)\n\nThe Treasury Department on Thursday slapped six Russian technology companies with sanctions for supporting Kremlin intelligence agencies\nengaged in “dangerous and disruptive cyber attacks.”\n\nBut only one of them stands out for its international footprint and partnerships with such IT heavyweights as Microsoft and IBM.\n\nThat company, Positive Technologies, claims more than 2,000 customers in 30 countries, including major European banks Societe Generale\nand ING, as well as Samsung, SK Telecom of South Korea and BT, the British telecommunications giant.\n\nIts clients also include the FSB, a successor to the KGB that “cultivates and co-opts criminal hackers” who carry out ransomware and phishing\nattacks, the Treasury Department said. The U.S. said big conventions hosted by Positive Technologies are “used as recruiting events” by the\nFSB and the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency.\n\nGRU agents are the swashbucklers of Russian intelligence. The agency stands accused of spearheading the hack-and-leak operation that\ninterfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to favor Donald Trump. Its agents also conducted the most damaging cyberattack on record,\nthe runaway 2017 NotPetya virus that did more than $10 billion in global damage, its victims including the shipping giant Maersk and\npharmaceutical company Merck.\n\nThe CEO of the software industry-supported Internet Research Institute in Moscow, Karen Kazaryan, said he was not familiar with most of the\n[Russian IT companies sanctioned on Thursday. But Positive Tech is well-known in the industry for its annual Hack Days conference, which is](https://apnews.com/article/us-expel-russia-diplomats-sanctions-6a8a54c7932ee8cbe51b0ce505121995)\nscheduled for May 20-21 at a Moscow hotel.\n\nFormer CIA analyst Michael van Landingham applauded the naming and sanctioning of Russian IT companies known to have aided and\nabetted malign government activity.\n\n“Naming specific companies can create incentives for educated and skilled Russians who might be able to obtain jobs elsewhere where they\ndon’t support Russian state hacking,” he said.\n\nPositive Tech’s specialty is identifying vulnerabilities in popular software such as Microsoft’s Windows operating system. The world’s\nintelligence agencies regularly lean on companies like it not to disclose potent vulnerabilities publicly when they find them but to instead quietly\nshare them for hacking adversaries’ networks.\n\nThe U.S. did not accuse Positive Technologies of any such behavior and the Treasury Department declined to answer questions about the\n[company’s activities beyond a press release.](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0127#)\n\nMicrosoft would not offer details on the the company’s business relationship with Positive Tech but did say it would comply with the sanctions.\nSpokesmen also said the company was removing Positive Tech from a list of more than [80 security software providers to which it gives early](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/mapp)\naccess to vulnerability information so they can make sure their customers get patches quickly. [IBM also lists Positive Technologies as a](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dsm?topic=guide-positive-technologies-maxpatrol)\nsecurity partner, offering customers one of its scanning tools.\n\nIBM didn’t respond to requests for comment Thursday. Neither did U.S. tech companies HP and VMware, which Positive Technologies lists as\ntechnology partners.\n\nOn its website, Positive Technologies lists Russia’s Defense Ministry as among its first major clients, in 2004 when it was two years old with\njust 11 employees. It claimed more than 800 employees in 2018.\n\nRussia’s biggest business database lists the company’s CEO and founder as Yury Maximov, about whom little is known other than he\ngraduated from Moscow State University. The company did not respond to questions sent to press contacts on its website.\n\nPositive Tech’s website boasts of a number of accomplishments, such as providing cybersecurity for the 2018 soccer World Cup hosted by\nRussia and publishing data that same year on 30 high-risk vulnerabilities. It said it opened its first international office in London in 2010 and its\nfirst U.S. office in 2012.\n\n\n-----\n\ne co pa y as so et es used a g a, assac usetts, as ts U S ocat o e s e eases, t oug t s ot eco ded c ty o state\nrecords as a business by that name. An office building with an address linked to the company is a co-working space that can be rented on\nflexible terms for “one person or more.”\n\nMarket research firm IDC listed Positive Technologies as one of the fastest-growing companies in security and vulnerability management in\n2012, in part because it was so small at the time, growing nearly 82% year-over-year to $30 million in worldwide revenue. Nearly all that\nrevenue came from assessing vulnerabilities. But by 2015, its worldwide revenues fell 37.6% to $26.5 million, according to IDC, which\neventually stopped tracking the company.\n\nAll contents © copyright 2022 The Associated Press.
