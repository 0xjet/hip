    "plain_text": "# Global Disruption of Three Terror Finance Cyber-Enabled Campaigns\n\n**[justice.gov/opa/pr/global-disruption-three-terror-finance-cyber-enabled-campaigns](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/global-disruption-three-terror-finance-cyber-enabled-campaigns)**\n\nAugust 12, 2020\n\nThe Justice Department today announced the dismantling of three terrorist financing cyberenabled campaigns, involving the al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, al-Qaeda,\nand Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). This coordinated operation is detailed in\nthree forfeiture complaints and a criminal complaint unsealed today in the District of\nColumbia. These actions represent the government’s largest-ever seizure of cryptocurrency\nin the terrorism context.\n\nThese three terror finance campaigns all relied on sophisticated cyber-tools, including the\nsolicitation of cryptocurrency donations from around the world. The action demonstrates\nhow different terrorist groups have similarly adapted their terror finance activities to the cyber\nage. Each group used cryptocurrency and social media to garner attention and raise funds\nfor their terror campaigns. Pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, U.S. authorities seized\nmillions of dollars, over 300 cryptocurrency accounts, four websites, and four Facebook\npages all related to the criminal enterprise.\n\nFunds successfully forfeited with a connection to a state sponsor of terrorism may in whole\nor in part be directed to the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund\n[(http://www.usvsst.com/) after the conclusion of the case.](http://www.usvsst.com/)\n\n“It should not surprise anyone that our enemies use modern technology, social media\nplatforms and cryptocurrency to facilitate their evil and violent agendas,” said Attorney\nGeneral William P. Barr.  “The Department of Justice will employ all available resources to\nprotect the lives and safety of the American public from terrorist groups. We will prosecute\ntheir money laundering, terrorist financing and violent illegal activities wherever we find them.\nAnd, as announced today, we will seize the funds and the instrumentalities that provide a\nlifeline for their operations whenever possible. I want to thank the investigators from the\n\n\n-----\n\nInternal Revenue Service, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, and the prosecutors from the D.C. United States Attorney’s Office and National\nSecurity Division for their hard and innovative work in attacking the networks that allow these\nterrorists to recruit for and fund their dangerous actions.”\n\n\"Terrorist networks have adapted to technology, conducting complex financial transactions in\nthe digital world, including through cryptocurrencies. IRS-CI special agents in the DC\ncybercrimes unit work diligently to unravel these financial networks,\" said Secretary of the\nTreasury Steven T. Mnuchin. \"Today's actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to\nholding malign actors accountable for their crimes.”\n\n“The Department of Homeland Security was born after the September 11, 2001 terrorist\nattacks and, nearly 20 years later, we remain steadfast in executing our critical mission to\nsafeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values,” said Acting Secretary of\nHomeland Security Chad F. Wolf. “Today’s announcement detailing these enforcement\nactions targeting foreign terrorist organizations is yet another example of the Department’s\ncommitment to our mission. After launching investigations that identified suspected online\npayments being funneled to and in support of terrorist networks, Homeland Security\nInvestigations skillfully leveraged their cyber, financial, and trade investigative expertise to\ndisrupt and dismantle cyber-criminal networks that sought to fund acts of terrorism against\nthe United States and our allies. Together with our federal law enforcement partners, the\nDepartment will utilize every resource available to ensure that our Homeland is and remains\nsecure.”\n\n“These important cases reflect the resolve of the D.C. United States Attorney’s Office to\ntarget and dismantle these sophisticated cyber-terrorism and money laundering actors\nacross the globe,” stated Acting United States Attorney Michael R. Sherwin. “While these\nindividuals believe they operate anonymously in the digital space, we have the skill and\nresolve to find, fix and prosecute these actors under the full extent of the law.”\n\n“IRS-CI’s ability to trace funds used by terrorist groups to their source and dismantle these\nradical group’s communication and financial networks directly prevents them from wreaking\nhavoc throughout the world,” said Don Fort, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation. “Today the\nworld is a safer place.”\n\n“As the primary law enforcement agency charged with defeating terrorism, the FBI will\ncontinue to combat illicit terrorist financing regardless of platform or method employed by our\nadversaries,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \"As demonstrated by this recent operation,\nthe FBI remains committed to cutting off the financial lifeblood of these organizations that\nseek to harm Americans at home and abroad.\"\n\n“Homeland Security Investigations continues to demonstrate their investigative expertise with\nthese enforcement actions,” said ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the\nDuties of the Director Matthew T. Albence. “Together with law enforcement partners, HSI\n\n\n-----\n\nhas utilized their unique authorities to bring to justice those cyber-criminal networks who\nwould do us harm.”\n\nAl-Qassam Brigades Campaign\n\nThe first action involves the al-Qassam Brigades and its online cryptocurrency fundraising\nefforts. In the beginning of 2019, the al-Qassam Brigades posted a call on its social media\npage for bitcoin donations to fund its campaign of terror. The al-Qassam Brigades then\nmoved this request to its official websites, alqassam.net, alqassam.ps, and qassam.ps.\n\nThe al-Qassam Brigades boasted that bitcoin donations were untraceable and would be\nused for violent causes. Their websites offered video instruction on how to anonymously\nmake donations, in part by using unique bitcoin addresses generated for each individual\ndonor.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, such donations were not anonymous. Working together, IRS, HSI, and FBI agents\ntracked and seized all 150 cryptocurrency accounts that laundered funds to and from the alQassam Brigades’ accounts. Simultaneously, law enforcement executed criminal search\nwarrants relating to United States-based subjects who donated to the terrorist campaign.\n\nWith judicial authorization, law enforcement seized the infrastructure of the al-Qassam\nBrigades websites and subsequently covertly operated alqassam.net.  During that covert\noperation, the website received funds from persons seeking to provide material support to\nthe terrorist organization, however, they instead donated the funds bitcoin wallets controlled\nby the United States.\n\nThe United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia also unsealed criminal\ncharges for two Turkish individuals, Mehmet Akti and Hüsamettin Karataş, who acted as\nrelated money launderers while operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n\nAl-Qaeda Campaign\n\nThe second cyber-enabled terror finance campaign involves a scheme by al-Qaeda and\naffiliated terrorist groups, largely based out of Syria. As the forfeiture complaint details, these\nterrorist organizations operated a bitcoin money laundering network using Telegram\n\n\n-----\n\nchannels and other social media platforms to solicit cryptocurrency donations to further their\nterrorist goals. In some instances, they purported to act as charities when, in fact, they were\nopenly and explicitly soliciting funds for violent terrorist attacks. For example, one post from\na charity sought donations to equip terrorists in Syria with weapons:\n\nUndercover HSI agents communicated with the administrator of Reminder for Syria, a related\ncharity that was seeking to finance terrorism via bitcoin donations. The administrator stated\nthat he hoped for the destruction of the United States, discussed the price for funding\nsurface-to air missles, and warned about possible criminal consequences from carrying out a\njihad in the United States.\n\nPosts from another Syrian charity similarly explicitly referenced weapons and extremist\nactivities:\n\n\n-----\n\nAl-Qaeda and the affiliated terrorist groups together created these posts and used\ncomplicated obfuscation techniques, uncovered by law enforcement, to layer their\ntransactions so to conceal their actions. Today’s complaint seeks forfeiture of the 155 virtual\ncurrency assets tied to this terrorist campaign.\n\nISIS Campaign\n\nThe final complaint combines the Department’s initiatives of combatting COVID-19 related\nfraud with combatting terrorism financing. The complaint highlights a scheme by Murat\nCakar, an ISIS facilitator who is responsible for managing select ISIS hacking operations, to\nsell fake personal protective equipment via FaceMaskCenter.com (displayed below)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe website claimed to sell FDA approved N95 respirator masks, when in fact the items\nwere not FDA approved. Site administrators claimed to have near unlimited supplies of the\nmasks, in spite of such items being officially-designated as scarce. The site administrators\noffered to sell these items to customers across the globe, including a customer in the United\nStates who sought to purchase N95 masks and other protective equipment for hospitals,\nnursing homes, and fire departments.\n\nThe unsealed forfeiture complaint seized Cakar’s website as well as four related Facebook\npages used to facilitate the scheme. With this third action, the United States has averted the\nfurther victimization of those seeking COVID-19 protective gear, and disrupted the continued\nfunding of ISIS.\n\nThe claims made in these three complaints are only allegations and do not constitute a\ndetermination of liability. The burden to prove forfeitability in a civil forfeiture proceeding is\nupon the government. Further, charges contained in criminal complaint are merely\nallegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond\na reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nIRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit (Washington, D.C.), HSI’s Philadelphia Office, and FBI’s\nWashington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles field offices are investigating the\ncase. Assistant U.S Attorneys Jessi Camille Brooks and Zia M. Faruqui, and National\nSecurity Division Trial Attorneys Danielle Rosborough and Alexandra Hughes are litigating\n\n\n-----\n\nthe case, with assistance from Paralegal Specialists Brian Rickers and Bria Cunningham,\nand Legal Assistant Jessica McCormick. Additional assistance has been provided by\nChainalysis and Excygent.\n\n\n-----",
