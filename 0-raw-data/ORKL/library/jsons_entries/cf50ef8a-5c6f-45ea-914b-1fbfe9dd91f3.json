    "plain_text": "# CrowdStrike Discovers New DoppelPaymer Ransomware & Dridex Variant\n\n**crowdstrike.com/blog/doppelpaymer-ransomware-and-dridex-2/**\n\nBrett Stone-Gross, Sergei Frankoff and Bex Hartley July 12, 2019\n\nCrowdStrike® Intelligence has identified a new ransomware variant identifying itself as BitPaymer. This new variant was behind a series of\n[ransomware campaigns beginning in June 2019, including attacks against the City of Edcouch, Texas and the](https://valleycentral.com/news/local/city-of-edcouch-recovering-from-data-hack) Chilean Ministry of\nAgriculture.\n\n[We have dubbed this new ransomware DoppelPaymer because it shares most of its code with the BitPaymer ransomware operated by](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\nINDRIK SPIDER. However, there are a number of differences between DoppelPaymer and BitPaymer, which may signify that one or more\nmembers of INDRIK SPIDER have split from the group and forked the source code of both Dridex and BitPaymer to start their own Big\nGame Hunting ransomware operation.\n\n## INDRIK SPIDER Origins\n\nINDRIK SPIDER was formed in 2014 by former affiliates of the GameOver Zeus criminal network who internally referred to themselves as\n“The Business Club.” Shortly after the group’s inception, INDRIK SPIDER developed their own custom malware known as Dridex. Early\n[versions of Dridex were primitive, but over the years the malware became increasingly professional and sophisticated. In fact, Dridex](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/)\noperations were significant throughout 2015 and 2016, making it one of the most prevalent eCrime malware families. At this time, INDRIK\n[SPIDER was primarily conducting wire fraud, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars globally.](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/14/hackers-being-hunted-after-using-dridex-malware-to-steal-over-30m.html)\n\nOver time, INDRIK SPIDER encountered a number of obstacles to their wire fraud operations. First, in 2015 the group had to overcome a\n[takedown operation, which resulted in the arrest of one of its affiliates, who used the alias “Smilex.” This setback was followed by a law](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bugat-botnet-administrator-arrested-and-malware-disabled)\nenforcement operation in the U.K. designed to break up the money laundering network supporting INDRIK SPIDER’s monetization of\nDridex campaigns. The dismantling of this network also coincided with the arrest, and subsequent imprisonment, of a U.K. bank employee\n[who helped set up fake accounts.](https://www.securityweek.com/barclays-bank-employee-jailed-role-malware-scheme)\n\nPerhaps as a result of these obstacles, INDRIK SPIDER changed their methods of operation in 2017, conducting smaller Dridex\ndistribution campaigns. In August 2017, the group introduced BitPaymer ransomware and began to focus on leveraging access within a\nvictim organization to demand a high ransom payment.\n\n## BitPaymer Origins\n\n[CrowdStrike Intelligence, has tracked the original BitPaymer since it was first identified in August 2017. In its first iteration, the BitPaymer](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/)\nransom note included the ransom demand and a URL for a TOR-based payment portal. The payment portal included the title “Bit paymer”\nalong with a reference ID, a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet, and a contact email address. An example of this portal is shown in Figure 1.\n\nWithin the first month of operation, the ransom amount was dropped from the ransom note. In July 2018, the payment portal URL was also\nremoved. From July 2018 until present, the ransom note has only included two contact emails, which are used to negotiate the ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Original BitPaymer Payment Portal via a TOR Hidden Service\n\n## Latest BitPaymer Version\n\nIn November 2018, there was a significant update to BitPaymer. The ransom note was updated to include the victim’s name, and the file\nextension appended to encrypted files was also customized to use a representation of the victim’s name. An example of the new ransom\nnote is shown below in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Latest BitPaymer Ransom Note\n\nIn addition to the updated ransom note and encrypted file extension, BitPaymer’s file encryption routine was updated to use 256-bit AES in\ncipher block chaining (CBC) mode with a randomly generated key and a NULL initialization vector. Previous versions of BitPaymer had\nused 128-bit RC4.\n\nSince AES is a block cipher, the implementation requires padding in cases where the data is not a multiple of the block size. Typically, this\nis implemented by adding zeros or the number n of padding bytes n times (also known as PKCS#7). However, INDRIK SPIDER chose to\ngenerate n bytes randomly for padding. As a result, the malware developer had to preserve the random padding bytes in order to correctly\ndecrypt the last data block of an encrypted file. This is reflected in the BitPaymer ransom note with a new field of `TAIL, as shown above`\nin Figure 2, which contains the Base64-encoded `TAIL padding and encrypted AES` `KEY.`\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, the BitPaymer developers implemented an encryption initialization function in the ransomware code that selects one of three\ndesired encryption algorithms. The algorithm is chosen by an argument that is passed as an integer parameter to the function. The current\nvalues supported are 1, 2, and 3 for 128-bit RC4, 128-bit AES and 256-bit AES, respectively. Newer versions of BitPaymer pass the hardcoded value of 3 for 256-bit AES encryption into the function, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Latest BitPaymer Encryption Selection Pseudocode\n\nAlong with the updated file encryption routine, the size of the victim-specific RSA public key has also been increased from 1,024-bit to\n4,096-bit. This asymmetric key is used to encrypt the generated symmetric file encryption keys. If the ransom is paid, INDRIK SPIDER will\nprovide a decryption tool that contains the corresponding victim’s RSA private key.\n\nIt is unclear why INDRIK SPIDER moved from RC4 to AES encryption, but it may be due to concerns about the relative weakness of RC4\nin comparison to AES. The increase in the RSA key size also greatly augments the cryptographic strength protecting the file encryption\nkeys. However, there is no evidence that BitPaymer’s prior or current encryption has been broken.\n\nSince the update in November 2018, INDRIK SPIDER has actively used the latest version of BitPaymer in at least 15 confirmed\nransomware attacks. These attacks have continued throughout 2019, with multiple incidents occurring in June and July of 2019 alone.\n\n## Meet DoppelPaymer\n\nWhile the first known victims of DoppelPaymer were targeted in June 2019, we were able to recover earlier builds of the malware dating\nback to April 2019. These earlier builds are missing many of the new features found in later variants, so it is not clear if they were deployed\nto victims or if they were simply built for testing.\n\nTo date, we have identified eight distinct malware builds and three confirmed victims with ransom amounts of 2 BTC, 40 BTC and 100\nBTC. Based on the USD to BTC exchange rate at the time of this writing, these ransom amounts vary from approximately $25,000 to over\n$1,200,000.\n\nThe ransom note used by DoppelPaymer is similar to those used by the original BitPaymer in 2018. The note does not include the ransom\namount; however, it does contain a URL for a TOR-based payment portal, and instead of using the keyword `KEY to identify the encrypted`\nkey, the note uses the keyword `DATA as shown in Figure 4.`\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. DoppelPaymer Ransom Note\n\nThe payment portal for DoppelPaymer is almost identical to the original BitPaymer portal. The “Bit paymer” title is still present on the web\npage and a unique ID is still used to identify the victim. The portal provides a ransom amount, a countdown timer and a BTC address\nwhere the ransom payment can be sent. An example of the DoppelPaymer ransom portal web page is shown below in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5. DoppelPaymer Ransomware Payment Portal\n\n## DoppelPaymer and BitPaymer Encryption Comparison\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough DoppelPaymer and BitPaymer share significant amounts of code, there are some notable encryption differences, which are\ndescribed in Table 1.\n\n**DoppelPaymer** **BitPaymer**\n\n\n**Ransom note** Each readme file contains an\nencrypted 256-bit AES key in a field\nnamed `DATA.`\n\n\nEach readme file contains an encrypted 256-bit AES key in a field named\n```\nKEY.\n\n```\nOlder versions contained an encrypted 128-bit RC4 key in the `KEY field.`\nCurrent versions use anonymous email services such as ProtonMail for ransom\npayment negotiations.\n\n\n**Encryption** 2048-bit RSA + 256-bit AES 4096-bit RSA + 256-bit AES. Older versions used 1024-bit RSA + 128-bit RC4.\n\n\n**Encryption**\n**(AES) padding**\n**scheme**\n\n**Ransom**\n**filename**\n\n\nStandard padding (PKCS#7) Random bytes specified in a field named `TAIL`\n\n\nEncrypted files are renamed with a\n```\n.locked extension.\n\n```\n\nEncrypted files are renamed with the victim name as the extension. Older\nversions are appended the suffix `.locked to the names of encrypted files.`\n\n\n**Table 1. Encryption-Related Differences Between DoppelPaymer and BitPaymer**\n\nThere are obvious similarities between the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by DoppelPaymer and prior TTPs of\nBitPaymer, such as the use of TOR for ransom payment and the `.locked extension. However, the code overlaps suggest that`\nDoppelPaymer is a more recent fork of the latest version of BitPaymer. For example, in the latest version of BitPaymer, the code for RC4\nstring obfuscation reverses the bytes prior to encryption, and includes a helper function that provides support for multiple forms of\nsymmetric encryption (i.e., RC4, 128-bit AES, and 256-bit AES), as shown in Figure 3.\n\n## New DoppelPaymer Features and the Use of ProcessHacker\n\nIn addition to the changes discussed above, numerous modifications were made to the BitPaymer source code to improve and enhance\nDoppelPaymer’s functionality. For instance, file encryption is now threaded, which can increase the rate at which files are encrypted. The\nnetwork enumeration code was updated to parse the victim system’s Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table, retrieved with the command\n```\narp.exe -a . The resulting IP addresses of other hosts on the local network are combined with domain resolution results via\nnslookup.exe . (In a similar approach, previous versions of BitPaymer made use of the command net.exe view to enumerate network\n\n```\nshares.)\n\nIn addition, DoppelPaymer is designed to run only after a specific command line argument is provided. The malware computes a CRC32\nchecksum of the first argument passed on the command line and adds it with a constant value that is hard-coded in the binary. The\nmalware then adds the instruction pointer address to this result, which becomes the destination for a jmp used to continue the malware\nexecution. The hard-coded constant value is unique to each build. In the sampled analyzed, this value was `0x672e6eb7, as shown below`\nin Figure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\ng pp y\n\nIf no arguments are provided, or if an incorrect value is provided on the command line, DoppelPaymer will crash. This design was likely\n[intended to hinder automated malware analysis environments.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/malware-analysis/)\n\nPerhaps the most interesting change that the DoppelPaymer author made is to terminate processes and services that may interfere with\nfile encryption. DoppelPaymer contains several lists of CRC32 checksums of process and service names that are blacklisted. The malware\nauthor included CRC32 checksums rather than strings to hinder reverse engineering efforts. However, it is possible to brute-force all of the\nchecksums and recover the respective strings, as shown in Tables 7-11 found in the Appendix.\n\n### ProcessHacker\n\n[In order to terminate some of these processes and services, DopplePaymer uses an interesting technique that leverages ProcessHacker, a](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)\nlegitimate open-source administrative utility. This application is bundled with a kernel driver that can be used to terminate processes and\nservices. DoppelPaymer is bundled with six portable executable (PE) files that are encrypted and compressed in the malware’s `sdata`\nsection. These PE files contain 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the following:\n\nProcessHacker application\nProcessHacker kernel driver\nA custom stager DLL that is used to exploit ProcessHacker\n\nThe modules are extracted by using the first 16 bytes of the `sdata section as an RC4 key to decrypt the next 4 bytes of data, which is the`\nsize (big endian) of the subsequent encrypted data. The encrypted data that follows also uses the first 16 bytes as an RC4 key to decrypt\nthe remaining data. The format is shown below in Table 2.\n\n**16 Bytes** **4 Bytes** **16 Bytes** **M Bytes**\n\nRC4 key Encrypted data size (M) RC4 key Encrypted data\n\n**Table 2. Format of Encrypted DoppelPaymer ProcessHacker Related Modules**\n\nAfter decryption, the first 4 bytes are the size of the compressed data, and the next 4 bytes are the size of the uncompressed data,\nfollowed by the compressed data as shown in Table 3.\n\n**4 Bytes** **4 Bytes** **N Bytes**\n\nCompressed size (N bytes) Uncompressed size Compressed 32-bit and 64-bit Process Hacker modules\n\n**Table 3.

Encrypted PE Files Embedded in DoppelPaymer**\n\nAfter decompression, all three binaries are written to the same directory. Both ProcessHacker and the kernel driver are written as random\nfilenames, but the stager DLL filename is chosen to be one of the DLL names imported by ProcessHacker. DoppelPaymer then executes\nProcessHacker which loads the stager DLL via DLL search order hijacking. Once loaded, ProcessHacker’s kernel driver is leveraged to kill\nthe blacklisted processes.\n\n## DoppelPaymer Links to “Dridex 2.0”\n\nA Dridex loader sample, identified by SHA256 hash `813d8020f32fefe01b66bea0ce63834adef2e725801b4b761f5ea90ac4facd3a, was`\ndistributed through the Emotet malware on June 4, 2019. The Dridex sample contained code to decrypt either a 32-bit or a 64-bit core bot\nmodule from its `sdata section using the exact same encryption, compression, and data format (previously described) that DoppelPaymer`\nuses to extract PEs from its `sdata section. This observation ties this Dridex variant directly with DoppelPaymer. The Dridex sample was`\nalso unusual; not only because the Dridex loader was bundled with the bot core module (rather than dynamically retrieving it from a C2\nserver), but also because the bot core module had a version number of 2.0.0.78. We have seen subsequent updates to this new variant of\nthe Dridex bot core module with the latest version being 2.0.0.80 at the time of writing. Of note, prior samples of Dridex had a version\nnumber of 4.0.0.87. It’s unclear why the malware author decided to use lower version numbers, but one explanation is that the threat actor\nviews this new creation as “Dridex 2.0.”\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBoth BitPaymer and DoppelPaymer continue to be operated in parallel and new victims of both ransomware families have been identified\nin June and July 2019. The parallel operations, coupled with the significant code overlap between BitPaymer and DoppelPaymer, indicate\n[not only a fork of the BitPaymer code base, but an entirely separate operation. This may suggest that the threat actor who is operating](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)\n[DoppelPaymer has splintered from INDRIK SPIDER and is now using the forked code to run their own Big Game Hunting ransomware](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/indrik-spider)\noperations.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_For more information on how to incorporate intelligence on dangerous threat actors into your security strategy, please visit the Falcon_\n_X product page._\n_[Download the CrowdStrike 2021 Global Threat Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/global-threat-report/)_\n_[Test CrowdStrike next-gen AV for yourself.
