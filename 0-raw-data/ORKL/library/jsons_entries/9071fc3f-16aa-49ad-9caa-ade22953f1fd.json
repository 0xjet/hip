Based on these](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/12/protecting-on-premises-exchange-servers-against-recent-attacks/)\nengagements we realized that there was a need for a simple, easy to use, automated\nsolution that would meet the needs of customers using both current and out-of-support\nversions of on-premises Exchange Server.\n\n_Microsoft has released a new,_ _[one-click mitigation tool, Microsoft Exchange On-Premises](https://aka.ms/eomt)_\n_Mitigation Tool to help customers who do not have dedicated security or IT teams to apply_\n_these security updates. We have tested this tool across Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and_\n2019 deployments. This new tool is designed as an interim mitigation for customers who are\nunfamiliar with the patch/update process or who have not yet applied the on-premises\nExchange security update.\n\n[By downloading and running this tool, which includes the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner,](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/safety-scanner-download)\ncustomers will automatically mitigate CVE-2021-26855 on any Exchange server on which it\nis deployed. This tool is not a replacement for the Exchange security update but is the fastest\nand easiest way to mitigate the highest risks to internet-connected, on-premises Exchange\nServers prior to patching.\n\nWe recommend that all customers who have not yet applied the on-premises Exchange\nsecurity update:\n\n[Download this tool.](https://aka.ms/eomt)\nRun it on your Exchange servers immediately.\n[Then, follow the more detailed guidance here to ensure that your on-premises](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/)\nExchange is protected.\n[If you are already using Microsoft Safety Scanner, it is still live and we recommend](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/safety-scanner-download)\nkeeping this running as it can be used to help with additional mitigations.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce run, the [Run EOMT.ps1 tool will perform three operations:](https://aka.ms/eomt)\n\nMitigate against current known attacks using CVE-2021-26855 using a URL Rewrite\nconfiguration.\n\n[Scan the Exchange Server using the Microsoft Safety Scanner.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/safety-scanner-download)\n\nAttempt to reverse any changes made by identified threats.\n\nBefore running the tool, you should understand:\n\nThe Exchange On-premises Mitigation Tool is effective against the attacks we have\nseen so far, but is not guaranteed to mitigate all possible future attack techniques. This\n**tool should only be used as a temporary mitigation until your Exchange servers**\n**can be fully updated as outlined in our previous guidance.**\n**We recommend this script over the previous ExchangeMitigations.ps1 script as it**\n**tuned based on the latest threat intelligence. If you have already started with the**\nother script, it is fine to switch to this one.\nThis is a recommended approach for Exchange deployments with Internet access and\nfor those who want to attempt automated remediation.\nThus far, we have not observed any impact to Exchange Server functionality when\nthese mitigation methods are deployed.\n\n[For more technical information, examples, and guidance please review the GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/blob/main/Security/)\ndocumentation.\n\nMicrosoft is committed to helping customers and will continue to offer guidance and updates\n[that can be found at https://aka.ms/exchangevulns.](https://aka.ms/exchangevulns)\n\n\n-----\n\nMICROSOFT MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, AS TO\nTHE INFORMATION IN THIS GUIDANCE.
