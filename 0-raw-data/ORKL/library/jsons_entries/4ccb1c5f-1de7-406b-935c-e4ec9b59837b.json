Monitoring telemetry associated with two prominent Chinese APT\ngroups, we observed network connections predominately originating from the country of\nCambodia, including inbound connections originating from at least 24 Cambodian\ngovernment organizations.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that these Cambodian government entities were targeted\nand remain compromised by Chinese APT actors. This assessment is due to the\nmalicious nature and ownership of the infrastructure combined with persistent\nconnections over a period of several months.\n\n\n-----\n\nCambodia and China maintain strong diplomatic and economic ties. Since Cambodia\n[signed on to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, the relationship between](https://greenfdc.org/countries-of-the-belt-and-road-initiative-bri/)\nthese two countries has grown steadily.\n\n[In recent years, China’s most notable investment has been a project to modernize](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/06/cambodia-china-navy-base-ream/)\n[Cambodia's Ream Naval Base. This project generated controversy and drew scrutiny](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/06/cambodia-china-navy-base-ream/)\nfrom several Western nations due to initial attempts by both countries to conceal the\nproject.\n\nAs the project nears completion this year, the naval base is on track to become China’s\nfirst overseas outpost in Southeast Asia. As such, this project demonstrates how\nsignificant Cambodia is to China’s ambitions of projecting power and expanding naval\noperations in the region.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protection from this malicious infrastructure\n[through our Next-Generation Firewall with Cloud-Delivered Security Services, including](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\n[DNS Security and Advanced URL Filtering.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/dns-security)\n\n**Related Unit 42 Topics** **[China, APAC, APT](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/china/)**\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nInfrastructure Overview\nSuspected Cambodian Government Targets\nCommand and Control Infrastructure\nActor Pattern of Life\nConclusion\nProtections and Mitigations\nIndicators of Compromise\nDomains\nInfrastructure IP Addresses\nSSL Certificate SHA-1 Fingerprint\n\n## Infrastructure Overview\n\nUnit 42 identified infrastructure associated with the following known malicious SSL\ncertificate:\n\n\n**Subject Full**\n**Name**\n\n**Issuer Full**\n**Name**\n\n\nC=US,ST=Some-State,O=Internet Widgits Pty\nLtd,CN=10.200.206.100\n\nC=US,ST=Some-State,O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd,CN=COM\n\n\n**Serial Number** 15007560845348164646\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA1 Hash** B8CFF709950CFA86665363D9553532DB9922265C\n\n**Valid From** 2017-11-23\n\n**Valid To** 2027-11-21\n\n_Table 1. SSL Certificate Overview._\n\nMost recently, this certificate was used by servers on six target-facing IP addresses. Each\nof these servers host several subdomains associated with six domains.\n\nBased on their names, a number of these domains appear to masquerade as cloud\nstorage services. This disguise likely lends a sense of legitimacy to the unusual amount\nof traffic during times of high activity levels from the actor, such as data exfiltration from\nthe victim network.\n\nFigure 1 provides a visualization of the malicious infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Infrastructure overview.\n\n## Suspected Cambodian Government Targets\n\nWe observed a total of 24 Cambodian government organizations regularly communicating\nwith this infrastructure between September and October 2023. A number of these\norganizations provide critical services in the following industries:\n\n\n-----\n\nNational defense\nElection oversight\nHuman rights\nNational treasury and finance\nCommerce\nPolitics\nNatural resources\nTelecommunications\n\nThese targets all hold vast amounts of sensitive data, including the following:\n\nFinancial data\nPersonally identifiable information of citizens\nClassified government information\n\nWe assess that these organizations are likely the targets of long-term cyberespionage\nactivities that have leveraged this infrastructure for persistent access to government\nnetworks of interest.\n\n## Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nWe assess with high confidence that the target-facing IP addresses are being used as\ncommand and control (C2) infrastructure by the threat actor. We believe the infrastructure\n[is running the Cowrie honeypot on port 2222. The attackers are likely using this honeypot](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie)\nas a cover to deceive network defenders and researchers investigating anomalous\nactivity.\n\nWe have also observed IP filtering on this infrastructure. Specifically, we have observed\nthe blocking of connections from the following:\n\nKnown Palo Alto Networks IP ranges\nSome VPS and cloud hosting providers\nIP ranges from a number of Big Tech and other cybersecurity companies\n\nWe believe this threat actor is filtering connections to the malicious infrastructure to\nminimize the risk of the C2s being profiled by IP scanners or identified by cybersecurity\nresearchers.\n\nWe have also observed C2 ports open during activity times for the threat actor and closed\nat all other times. Again, this is likely to minimize the risk of the infrastructure being\nprofiled by IP scanners or identified by researchers.\n\nTable 2 outlines the known actor and target-facing ports.\n\n**IP Address** **Target Port** **Domain(s)**\n\n\n-----\n\n165.232.186[.]197 80, 443, 4433 api.infinitycloud[.]info\nconnect.infinitycloud[.]info\n\nns.infinitycloud[.]info\n\n\n167.71.226[.]171 80, 81, 82, 443, 769, 4433, 8086,\n8089\n\n\nfile.wonderbackup[.]com\nconnect.infinitybackup[.]net\n\nshare.infinitybackup[.]net\n\nsync.wonderbackup[.]com\n\n\n104.248.153[.]204 82, 443 update.wonderbackup[.]com\nlogin.wonderbackup[.]com\n\nns1.infinitybackup[.]net\n\n143.110.189[.]141 443 mfi.teleryanhart[.]com\nads.teleryanhart[.]com\n\n172.105.34[.]34 8081, 8087, 8443, 8888 jlp.ammopak[.]site\nkwe.ammopak[.]site\n\nlxo.ammopak[.]site\n\ndfg.ammopak[.]site\n\nfwg.ammopak[.]site\n\n194.195.114[.]199 8080, 8443, 9200 connect.clinkvl[.]com\n\n_Table 2. Target-facing infrastructure details._\n\n## Actor Pattern of Life\n\nWhile investigating the cluster of infrastructure, we were able to determine the actor’s\npattern of life. We predominantly observed the actor’s activity between 08:30 and 17:30\nUTC +08:00 (China Standard Time) on weekdays (Monday to Friday). This pattern might\nindicate the actor is attempting to avoid detection by blending into regular Cambodian\nbusiness hours which are UTC +07:00.\n\nHowever, we also observed a significant change in actor activity that suggests the actor is\nbased in China and working regular business hours in China.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis change in the actor’s pattern of life occurred between Sep. 29 and Oct. 8, 2023.\nActor activity ceased on Sep. 29, with low amounts of activity through the week of Oct. 28, including the weekend of Oct. 7-8. We saw actor activity return to regular levels and\npatterns starting Oct. 9.\n\nThe dates of the actor’s activity changes align with China’s Golden Week, held on Sep.\n29 to Oct. 6, 2023, and “Special Working Days,” designated as Oct. 7-8, 2023. Special\nWorking Days are Chinese government-mandated working days to compensate for the\nextended holiday.\n\nFigure 2 shows the regular activity pattern and deviation during Golden Week, before\nreturning to normal.\n\nFigure 2. Actor pattern of life.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnit 42 identified Chinese APT-associated activity targeting Cambodia, including over 20\nCambodian government organizations across a range of key industries. This activity is\nbelieved to be part of a long-term espionage campaign.\n\nThe observed activity aligns with geopolitical goals of the Chinese government as it seeks\nto leverage their strong relations with Cambodia to project their power and expand their\nnaval operations in the region. We encourage all organizations to leverage our findings to\ninform the deployment of protective measures to defend against this activity.\n\n### Protection Recommendations\n\nTo defend against the threats described in this blog, Palo Alto Networks recommends\norganizations employ the following capabilities:\n\n[Network Security: Delivered through a Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) configured](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/ngfw)\nwith machine learning enabled and cloud-delivered security services.
