The domains were tied to\nMoqHao, a malware family targeting Android OS devices, primarily in Japan, South Korea,\nand Taiwan:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Seed Twitter Post\n\nPassive DNS Data\n\nUsing Team Cymru’s Pure Signal Platform, we performed a wildcard search for domains\nusing the pattern of ‘t.aeo*.com’. This search identified all of the domains and the hosting IP\naddresses previously found by @NaomiSuzuki_ and @KesaGataMe0.\n\n**IP Address** **AS Name** **Hostname** **First Seen**\n\n103.75.189.31 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeokc.com 2021-01-07\n\n103.75.189.31 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeomnv.com 2021-01-07\n\n104.27.180.110 Cloudflare, US t.aeogu.com 2021-01-11\n\n104.27.180.110 Cloudflare, US t.aeogu.com 2021-01-11\n\n104.27.188.38 Cloudflare, US t.aeoin.com 2021-01-11\n\n104.27.188.38 Cloudflare, US t.aeoin.com 2021-01-11\n\n172.67.199.42 Cloudflare, US t.aeogu.com 2021-01-11\n\n\n-----\n\n172.67.215.77 Cloudflare, US t.aeoin.com 2021-01-11\n\n178.132.7.109 WorldStream, NL t.aeomk.com 2021-01-15\n\n188.213.49.231 Parfumuri Femei, RO t.aeomq.com 2021-01-13\n\n20.48.114.7 Microsoft, US t.aeomk.com 2021-01-15\n\n20.48.114.7 Microsoft, US t.aeomp.com 2021-01-14\n\n20.48.114.7 Microsoft, US t.aeomz.com 2021-01-15\n\n213.183.48.212 Melbicom, LT t.aeoyhl.com 2021-01-08\n\n216.189.159.35 HostUS, US t.aeokc.com 2021-01-07\n\n216.189.159.35 HostUS, US t.aeomnv.com 2021-01-07\n\n216.189.159.35 HostUS, US t.aeovn.com 2021-01-08\n\n27.100.36.35 HostUS, AU t.aeomnv.com 2021-01-07\n\n40.74.72.100 Microsoft, US t.aeomt.com 2021-01-12\n\n40.74.72.100 Microsoft, US t.aeoob.com 2021-01-11\n\n45.121.147.170 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeoin.com 2021-01-11\n\n45.121.147.170 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeomg.com 2021-01-14\n\n45.121.147.170 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeomh.com 2021-01-15\n\n45.121.147.170 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeomu.com 2021-01-13\n\n45.121.147.242 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeomc.com 2021-01-15\n\n45.121.147.242 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeoxq.com 2021-01-18\n\n45.121.147.50 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeodr.com 2021-01-08\n\n45.121.147.50 Gigabit Hosting, MY t.aeoxi.com 2021-01-08\n\n45.58.52.60 HostUS, US t.aeodr.com 2021-01-08\n\n45.58.52.60 HostUS, US t.aeoyhl.com 2021-01-08\n\n51.83.247.167 OVH, FR t.aeoxq.com 2021-01-18\n\nTable 1 – Domains Spoofing Aeon Bank\n\nFrom this list we can see that several of the IP addresses were used to host two or more\ndomains:\n\n\n-----\n\n**IP Address** **AS Name**\n\n45.121.147.50 Gigabit Hosting, MY\n\n45.58.52.60 HostUS, US\n\n103.75.189.31 Gigabit Hosting, MY\n\n216.189.159.35 HostUS, US\n\n45.121.147.242 Gigabit Hosting, MY\n\n45.121.147.170 Gigabit Hosting, MY\n\n20.48.114.7 Microsoft, US\n\n40.74.72.100 Microsoft, US\n\nTable 2 – IP Addresses Hosting Multiple Phishing Domains\n\nPerforming a passive DNS search on these IP addresses identifies another pattern of\nspoofed domains, this time targeting Japan’s The 77 Bank, Ltd.\n\nBy performing another wildcard domain search for ‘77*bnk.com’ we identified the following:\n\n**IP Address** **AS Name** **Name Queried** **Min of Timestamp**\n\n103.75.189.31 Gigabit Hosting, MY 77cbnk.com 2021-01-07\n\n104.27.180.251 Cloudflare, US 77ebnk.com 2021-01-12\n\n104.27.181.251 Cloudflare, US 77ebnk.com 2021-01-12\n\n172.67.158.54 Cloudflare, US 77ebnk.com 2021-01-12\n\n216.189.159.35 HostUS, US 77obnk.com 2021-01-08\n\n27.100.36.35 HostUS, AU 77bbnk.com 2021-01-05\n\n27.100.36.35 HostUS, AU 77cbnk.com 2021-01-06\n\nTable 3 – Domains Spoofing The 77 Bank\n\nSeveral of these domains, including 77cbnk.com, 77bbnk.com, and 77bac.com were already\nobserved by Twitter sleuths @NaomiSuzuki_ and @KesaGataMe0.\n\n**Note: A domain spoofing Japan’s Jibun Bank, ‘t.auznw.com’ was also hosted on**\n45.121.147.242, but we couldn’t find any more domains that followed the same pattern.\nLikewise the domains ‘aetvk com’ ‘aenbv com’ ‘aeenm com’ and ‘aenvv com’ were also\n\n\n-----\n\nused to spoof AEON Bank (using a slightly different naming pattern) but did not lead to any\nadditional discoveries.\n\nX.509 Data\n\nLooking at our X.509 certificate records, we find one certificate hosted on IP address\n40.74.72.100:\n\n**Field** **Value**\n\nSubject DN CN=aeoob.com\n\nIssuer DN C=US, O=Let’s Encrypt, CN=R3\n\nSerial 0xeeb4ec0ef406cb854ddffb1c9fd2276c\n\nValidity 2021-01-11 07:49:38 to 2021-04-11 07:49:38 (90 days)\n\nSHA-1 c2029fa68bfa34fefc4ac48360434989122f1348\n\nTable 4 – x509 Certificate Associated with aeoob.com\n\nNone of the other domains appeared to have an associated certificate, so it is unknown why\nthe domain ‘aeoob.com’ is the exception. Nonetheless, it’s an additional data point to look\nout for in the future.\n\nNetFlow Data\n\nLooking at netflow, we see over 250 unique Japanese IP addresses connecting over TCP\nport 443 (HTTPS) to the IP addresses in Table 2. The connecting IP addresses are all\nregistered to Softbank, NTT, OPTAGE, or NTT Docomo, indicating they are likely residential\ncustomers. The vast majority of overall TCP/443 traffic to these IP addresses came from\nJapan, so the traffic likely represents victims who fell prey to the phishing campaign.\n\nThe actors appear to have covered their tracks carefully. A high percentage of the netflow\ntraffic directed at five of the eight IP addresses listed in Table 2 came from 210.140.10.24\n(IDC Frontier Inc., JP) and 45.114.130.4 (EHOSTIDC, KR), both of which are Tor exit nodes.\n\nFigure 2 – Top Communicating IP Addresses in NetFlow Data\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile we can t draw any further conclusions as to attribution of this activity at this stage, with\nTeam Cymru’s Pure Signal platform we can continue to monitor new spoofed banking\ndomains and IP addresses as they appear.\n\n\n-----",
