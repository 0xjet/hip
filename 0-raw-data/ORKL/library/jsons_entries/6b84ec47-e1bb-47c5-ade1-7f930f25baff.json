    "plain_text": "# Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerabilities \n\n###### One of the greatest threats to U.S. National Security Systems (NSS), the U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and Department of Defense (DoD) information networks is Chinese state-sponsored malicious cyber activity. These networks often undergo a full array of tactics and techniques used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors to exploit computer networks of interest that hold sensitive intellectual property, economic, political, and military information. Since these techniques include exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities, it is critical that network defenders prioritize patching and mitigation efforts. \n\n The same process for planning the exploitation of a computer network by any sophisticated cyber actor is used by Chinese state-sponsored hackers. They often first identify a target, gather technical information on the target, identify any vulnerabilities associated with the target, develop or re-use an exploit for those vulnerabilities, and then launch their exploitation operation.\n\n This advisory provides Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) known to be recently leveraged, or scanned-for, by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors to enable successful hacking operations against a multitude of victim networks. Most of the vulnerabilities listed below can be exploited to gain initial access to victim networks using products that are directly accessible from the Internet and act as gateways to internal networks. The majority of the products are either for remote access (T1133)[1] or for external web services (T1190), and should be prioritized for immediate patching. While some vulnerabilities have specific additional mitigations below, the following mitigations generally apply:\n\n#####  Keep systems and products updated and patched as soon as possible after patches are released.[2]\n  Expect that data stolen or modified (including credentials, accounts, and software) before the device was patched\n###### will not be alleviated by patching, making password changes and reviews of accounts a good practice.\n\n#####  Disable external management capabilities and set up an out-of-band management network.[3]\n  Block obsolete or unused protocols at the network edge and disable them in device configurations.[4]\n  Isolate Internet-facing services in a network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to reduce the exposure of the internal\n###### network.[5]\n\n#####  Enable robust logging of Internet-facing services and monitor the logs for signs of compromise.[6]\n\n#### Detailed Vulnerabilities and Mitigations\n\n###### The following is a list of CVEs being actively used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, a description of the vulnerability, and the recommended mitigations. (NOTE: The following list of CVEs is non-exhaustive of what is available or perhaps used by Chinese state-sponsored cyber actors, but is a list of those being operationalized by China.)\n\n**Prior NSA Cybersecurity Guidance**\n**CVE Number** **Vulnerability Description**\n\n**(Some focused on other actors)**\n**[CVE-2019-11510](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11510)** **_In Pulse Secure VPNs,[® 7] an unauthenticated remote_** CSA – Mitigating Recent VPN Vulnerabilities\n**_attacker can send a specially crafted URI to perform an_** U/OO/196888-19\n**_arbitrary file reading vulnerability.

Transition SSLVPN/TLSVPN deployments to either IETF standard-conformant TLS for single application use cases, or to IKE/IPsec VPNs, preferably using one of the evaluated TLS software applications or IPSec VPN gateways/clients listed on the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Product Compliant List (PCL).|||\n|CVE-2020-5902|In F5 BIG-IP® 8 proxy / load balancer devices, the Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI) - also referred to as the Configuration utility - has a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in undisclosed pages.|CSI – Harden Network Devices U/OO/171339-16 CSI – Perform Out-of-Band Network Management U/OO/169570-20|\n|Affects: F5 BIG-IP versions 15.0.0-15.1.0.3, 14.1.0-14.1.2.5, 13.1.0-13.1.3.3, 12.1.0-12.1.5.1, and 11.6.1-11.6.5.1. [2] Additional Mitigations: By default, the TMUI is accessible via the management interface on both the external and internal interface. Best practice is to disable the external interface and configure an out-of-band management network. NSA released guidance for this in the Harden Network Devices CSI (U/OO/171339-16) and the Perform Out-of-Band Network Management CSI (U/OO/169570-20).|||\n|CVE-2019-19781|An issue was discovered in Citrix® 9 Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Gateway.

Additional Mitigations: Block TCP Port 3389 at your firewalls, especially any perimeter firewalls exposed to the internet. This port is used by the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and will block attempts to establish a connection. Disable Remote Desktop Services if they are not required. Disabling unused and unneeded services helps reduce exposure to security vulnerabilities overall and is a best practice even without the BlueKeep threat. Enable Network Level Authentication. With NLA enabled, attackers would first have to authenticate to RDS in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
