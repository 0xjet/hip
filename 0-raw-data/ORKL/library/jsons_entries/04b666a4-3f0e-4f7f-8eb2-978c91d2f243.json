    "plain_text": "## EvilNominatus Ransomware 7/4/22\n\n# Exposing the Iranian EvilNominatus Ransomware\n\n### Introduction\n\nAs part of our monitoring of malicious files in current use, we detected a malicious BAT file that was\n\nuploaded to VirusTotal from Iran. This file executes a ransomware that we associated with the\n\nEvilNominatus ransomware, initially exposed at the end of 2021. It seems that the ransomware's developer\n\nis a young Iranian, who bragged about its development on Twitter.\n\nAt this point, we have no details regarding any victims of this ransomware. We publish this research due to\nthe malware’s unique method of operation, and the low number of AV engines capable of detecting it.\nThe original BAT file the research is based on was only detected by two AV engines on VirusTotal. Another\nBAT file that was discovered later, which shares characteristics with the first one, wasn't detected by any\nAV engines. Other files that were either generated by the BAT files or communicated with them to carry out\nattacks were detected by multiple AV engines. Therefore, we assess that the tool's general level of risk is\nlow at this point.\n\nFollowing is the BAT file, 650KB in size, in its encoded form:\n\nThe encoded BAT file can download additional malicious files, deleting shadow copies, encrypting files,\n\ncancelling the registry edit tool, as well as multiple other capabilities that will be discussed in this report.\nThe report will also provide details concerning the ransomware's developer, their email address, and their\n\nusername on Discord and Twitter.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCopyright © 2022, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”).

The \"GoogleAlert.vbs\" file located on the URL is flagged by 19 out of\n53 AV engines.\n\n### Dynamic Investigation\n\nDuring the dynamic investigation of the BAT file, a number of files were generated, each responsible for\n\nseveral actions:\n\nA screenshot with a partial list of the generated files\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCopyright © 2022, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”).

If you have received\nthis document by mistake, please delete it without reviewing it.\n\n\n-----\n\n## EvilNominatus Ransomware 7/4/22\n\n1. An executable named \"AntivirusScan.exe\" was generated. The file's hash on VirusTotal is detected\n\nas malicious by 49 out of 68 AV engines, and it is named \"EvilNominatusCrypto.exe\". The file\nmodifies Windows' LOGIN/LOGOFF path on the registry. This modification prevents users from\naccessing the Taskbar.\n\n2. A TXT file named \"XoX\" was generated. The file is encoded and decrypted by Windows' Certutil. It\n\nis possible that the \"XoX\" file is designed to execute the \"AntivirusScan.exe\" file.\n\n3. Actions carried out by the BAT file:\n\n      - It generates a file named \"RagentOXoX.exe\" that downloads a file named \"crash.bat\" to\nestablish persistence:\nC:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\StartMenu\\Programs\\Startup\\C\nrash.bat\n\n      - It reads the computer's name.\n\n      - It examines the supported languages on the system (the file does not seem to change its\nbehavior according to this check).\n4. A malicious file named \"Nod32Installer.exe\" is downloaded. This file impersonates ESET's security\n\nproduct for computers. This file's hash is detected by 15/68 AV engines on VirusTotal.\n5. A malicious file named \"KasperskyFreeScan.exe\" is generated via the certutil.exe process. The\n\nmalicious file impersonates the name of Kaspersky's security product as well.\n\n6. All TXT files are Base64-encoded. Before their execution, the malicious files use the certutil service\n\nto decode via the decrypt command. Base64 encoding is used by malware to prevent AV engines\n\nfrom detecting malicious strings.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCopyright © 2022, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”).

An additional BAT file with 0 detections on VirusTotal and Intezer\nwas detected among these files. Dynamically executing the file indicates that it is the same ransomware\nfile, with the same capabilities as described above.\nThe file's details:\n\nFile Name: txt.bat\nFile Type: bat\nMD5: 765d27aede93251a79d7685c7403a70b\nSHA-1: 3c8d4a0d6590bc0e632cde0c93d9da09194e118a\nSHA-256: 582152adf8ec9a1ea0e2b530e93fcfa2d36f2d384c6582c0478188a1bb67edab\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCopyright © 2022, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”).

While examining\n\n\"RagentOXoX.exe\" we found out that the file's name was \"Virus.DOS.RozbehStrike\". This name resembles\nthe username that claimed credit for the ransomware on VirusTotal – \"RozbehCrypt666\".\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCopyright © 2022, ClearSky Cyber Security Ltd (“ClearSky”).
