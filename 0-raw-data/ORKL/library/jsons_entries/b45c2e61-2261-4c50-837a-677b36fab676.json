This financial option has proven to be the preferable\nchoice of many Latin Americans due to the safety and facility to engage in transactions,\nespecially when sending money to family and friends abroad. Indeed, in a global poll,\nLATAM is the region with the highest number of cryptocurrency users.\n\nWith the recent possibility to open a bank account online, a trend emerges: identity\ntheft and consequential fraudulent new bank accounts. Again, Brazil holds 1st place in\nthe Latin American ranking of identity theft crimes: yearly, the country faces a loss of\n$60 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $11,3 billion). Fraudulent bank accounts allow\nthe cybercriminal to sign loan contracts and contract debts in another person’s name.\nThese activities do not only affect the victim and the bank but also negatively impact\nthe whole dynamic of DFS, implying further regulations that might hinder financial\ninclusion and positive user experiences.\n\nFurthermore, malicious software variants are spread throughout Latina America.\nPreviously these malware variants did not originate in the region; however, new\ncommunities of Spanish and Portuguese-speaking hackers changed this reality.\n\n[Globally, the financial sector is the second most affected sector by cybercrime - behind](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/financial-services-threat-of-cybersecurity/69023/)\nonly retail. This reality is not different in LATAM. Banks and other financial institutions\nface challenges that regard fraud, be it due to identity theft (as discussed above) or\ntrojan and backdoor mechanisms. The Emotet botnet (targeting mostly banks)\n[presence in the region represents 45% of the global employment of the tool. In general,](https://labsnews.com/en/news/technology/banks-are-the-main-target-of-cyberattack-attempts-in-latin-america/#:~:text=Brazil%20was%20the%20Latin%20America,in%202019%20only%20in%20Brazil)\nin 2019, LATAM suffered 85 billion attack attempts in regards to malware variants and\nbotnet activity, the most affected country is Brazil with 24 billion cyberattacks in a year.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe causes for financial cybercrime in LATAM have been discussed in a previous AdvIntel\nreport, in the current report, a few case studies were selected to illustrate the diversity of the\nLatin American financial cyberthreat landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlong with and driven by the boom of online shopping and balkanization, Latin America also\nexperiences the emergence of different types of frauds and further financial cybercrimes.\nPreviously only portrayed as targeted victims, Latin American countries are starting to\nwitness the creation of hacker groups capable of deploying cyber attacks in the region and\nelsewhere. Latin American cybercriminals have been developing their own codes in Spanish\nand Portuguese languages and launching national and regional attacks, and now they have\ngrown to a point that they started a process of cyber-internationalization.\n\nThis report is structured as follows: there will be a brief discussion followed by case studies\nfor three subsections, namely the case of cryptocurrencies, financial crimes targeting users,\nand crimes targeting financial institutions.\n\n**Cryptocurrency-Related Cybercrimes**\n\nWith the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies, banking trojan families are no longer targeting\nonly formal banking institutions and their users. The design of banking trojan variants\nincreasingly includes functions related to cryptocurrency wallets. In Latin America, where\nthese currencies are progressively popular, fraud schemes that encompass cryptocurrencies\nare a trend.\n\nDue to political and subsequent economic instability experienced in Latin American\ncountries, which tend to devalue currencies, cryptocurrencies are an easy alternative to\n[conserve one’s personal wealth. This financial option has proven to be the preferable choice](https://contxto.com/en/informative/cryptocurrency-revolutionizes-monetary-exchanges-latin-america/)\nof many Latin Americans due to the safety and facility to engage in transactions, especially\nwhen sending money to family and friends abroad. Indeed, in a global poll, LATAM is the\nregion with the highest number of cryptocurrency users.\n\n\n-----\n\n_5 Latin American countries stand in the top 10 countries with the highest number of crypto_\n_users._\n\nDespite the positive aspects of cryptocurrency, its vast use does not come unaccompanied\nby negative consequences. Due to blockchain technology, which allows for the almost\nabsolute untraceability of transactions, these currencies are being used for money\n[laundering purposes. According to “The Dark Side of America Latina” report, this malicious](https://wow.intsights.com/rs/071-ZWD-900/images/Dark%20Side%20of%20Latin%20America.pdf)\nuse takes place in three ways:\n\n1. Through a cryptocurrency tumbler, which mixes legitimate crypto with compromised\n\nones (dark web crypto, for instance);\n\n2. Benefiting from the lack of or weak national regulations when it comes to know-your\ncustomer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) policies;\n\n3. Resorting to illegal peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges to launder illicit cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs a result, 97% of all washed cryptocurrencies end up in LATAM, due to the loose\nregulations displayed by these countries. What can be inferred from these pictures is that\nLatin America offers great opportunities for cryptocurrency-related crimes.\n\n\n-----\n\nYet, as in any space where financial transactions occur, cryptocurrency wallets are targets for\ncybercriminals. Users are not spared from cybercriminal activities, and we have been\nwitnessing the creation of malicious software variants targeting users. A few case studies are\noffered below to illustrate the current situation crypto users are vulnerable to.\n\n**Case Studies**\n\n**Metamorfo, the Banking Trojan with Cryptocurrency Theft Mechanisms**\n\nMetamorfo, also called Casbaneiro, was first spotted in May 2018 in Brazil, and since then, it\nhas been quickly spreading through Latin America. Mexico is their second most-targeted\ncountry; yet, infections have also been recorded in the US, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador,\n[and Spain. Metamorfo targets more than 20 online banks in Brazil and around 7 in Mexico.](https://www.techtudo.com.br/noticias/2019/10/novo-trojan-casbaneiro-mira-em-bancos-brasileiros-para-roubar-criptomoedas.ghtml)\nThe malware variant is believed to be of Latin American origin, among other reasons, due to\nits capability to scan, detect, and target specific Latin American banking applications\navailable at the infected device.\n\nInfection vectors employed by Metamorfo’s campaigns are mainly phishing emails with\nattached malicious files. Yet it can also be delivered through fake update messages from\nWhatsApp, Spotify, and Onedrive that mimic official communication, and that will induce the\nuser to download the malicious file that contains the malware variant.\n\nOnce Metamorfo infects the machine, its backdoor capabilities, which are very common\namong Latin American banking trojan families, include: taking screenshots (that are sent\n**to the C&C server), keylogging (keystrokes recording), simulating mouse and**\n**keyboard actions, and restricting access to specific websites. Besides that,** Metamorfo\ncan also download and execute supplementary executable files, additional malware variants\nsuch as cryptocurrency miners, ransomware variants, and further malicious software\nfamilies. It is interesting to note that Metamorfo uses Youtube to host its C&C servers’\ndomains. The YouTube accounts used are related to cooking recipes and football.\n\nBeyond the above-mentioned capabilities, Metamorfo also collects the user’s operational\n**system version, user name, device name, and all installed anti-virus solutions. Finally,**\n[Metamorfo verifies which banking applications the machine holds, especially security ones,](https://www.pcrisk.pt/guias-de-remocao/9898-casbaneiro-trojan)\nsuch as Diebold Warsaw, and Trusteer.\n\nThe banking trojan variant constantly monitors the victim’s activity to collect online banking\ncredentials; it then displays a fake version of the banking website that mimics the official one,\nso the user inserts their credentials into this fake mechanism.\n\nTheir technique regarding cryptocurrency theft is increasingly common in Latin American\nbanking trojan families. The user records their receivers’ addresses in their cryptocurrency\nwallet. When the user wants to perform a transaction (transfer or deposit), they will usually\n\n\n-----\n\ncopy and paste the intended address into the transaction page. Metamorfo intervenes in this\ndynamic by substituting the copied address (with the intended receiver’s address) with\nanother criminal address.\n\n_Mitigation Note_\n\nThe mitigation of the banking trojan issue is done through a combined strategy\nbetween technological and behavioral measures. In terms of behavior, users must be\nengaged with cybersecurity best practices, which include knowledge about how to\nidentify phishing emails and how to act in the case. Users must also be skilled with\nbasic knowledge to identify fake communications of official applications and services, in\norder not to download fake files that mimic authentic programs.\n\nIn technological terms, the user must run potent and updated security solutions. These\ntools will help the user to identify and remove potential threats before infection; and in\nthe case of infection, it will support the user with a fast incident response action plan.\n\n**VictoryGate, Cryptojacking Botnet**\n\nIs no surprise that cybercriminals are developing malware variants that are cryptocurrencyrelated. One of these variants is the malware type known as cryptojacking, which is the\nundercovered and malicious use of a victim’s device to mine cryptocurrencies. VictoryGate is\nexactly this type of malware.\n\nVictoryGate was first spotted in May 2019, and it targets mainly Latin American users. More\nspecifically, it targets [Peru, where 90% of infected machines are located. The cryptojacking](https://criptonizando.com/2020/04/26/35-mil-computadores-foram-infectados-na-america-latina-por-malware-que-minerava-monero/23/)\nnature of VictoryGate means that what cybercriminals are looking for is the computational\npower of their victims, and not money or other types of information. VictoryGate works,\n**then, as a botnet - a network of machines interconnected to a server and that will mine**\ncryptocurrencies without the consent of the machines’ owners. There are no specific victims:\n[there were reported victims both in public and private sectors, which also included financial](https://misterhacker.com.br/blog/unidades-usb-maliciosas-infectam-35-000-computadores-com-botnet-de-mineracao-de-criptografia/)\ninstitutions.\n\nIn this specific case, the malware variant is specialized in the Monero (XRM) cryptocurrency.\nThis specific cryptocurrency is increasingly popular among cybercriminals, due to their focus\non privacy. This privacy feature and the consequential use of the cryptocurrency for illicit\nactivities made exchange platforms exclude Monero from their accepted cryptocurrencies.\nThe second feature of Monero that also contributes to their popularity among hackers is their\nminer algorithm being resistant to ASIC miners, which allows domestic mining (without the\nuse of a specific miner machine).\n\nOver 35.000 machines are believed to be infected by VictoryGate from 2019 on. By February\nand March 2020, 2.000 infected machines connected to the malware server daily, mining\nmore than 80 XMR (approximately $6.000).\n\n\n-----\n\nTheir main infection vectors are infected USB drives. When these USB drives are connected\nto the victim’s machine, it installs the malware VictoryGate. The malware code contains an\nAutolt agent that constantly scans new USB units, which allows the malware variant to\nspread to additional machines. The botmaster is also capable of updating the functionalities\nof VictoryGate, which increases the level of threat posed by this malware variant since their\nfunctionalities can evolve into any sort of malicious tool.\n\n_Mitigation Note_\n\nHaving a robust cybersecurity solution is the first step to mitigate the threat of\ncryptojacking malware variants. These tools are constantly scanning the machine for\nunusual and suspicious usage of the CPU, which can rapidly detect the presence of a\ncryptojacking malware such as VictoryGate - a malware variant that can use up to 90%\nof the CPU capacity of the machine.\n\nSince their main infection vectors are USB drives, critical machines must be spared\nfrom the use of such devices, which can be easily infected. Running the antivirus\nsolution on the drive before opening any file contained in it is also an important step to\nprevent infection.\n\n**Financial Crimes Targeting Banking**\n\nBesides the specific cases of cryptocurrency users and crimes targeting their wallets,\nmultiple financial cybercrimes are affecting online banking users. Only in the first semester of\n[2020, financial data theft rose 43% in Brazil, for instance. This type of statistic indicates the](https://extra.globo.com/economia/roubo-de-dados-bancarios-pela-internet-cresceu-43-no-pais-no-primeiro-semestre-24555102.html#:~:text=Esse%20tipo%20de%20crime%2C%20conhecido,acesso%20a%20suas%20contas%20banc%C3%A1rias)\nundermining effect such crimes have on the level of trust of users in digital financial services\n[(DFS). In a region with comparatively low levels of financial inclusion, low trust in DFS can](https://www.cgap.org/blog/4-cyber-attacks-threaten-financial-inclusion)\nhave relevant impacts on the economic growth and international integration of such\ncountries.\n\nWith the recent possibility to open a bank account online, a trend emerges: identity theft and\nconsequential fraudulent new bank accounts. Again, Brazil holds 1st place in the Latin\nAmerican ranking of identity theft crimes: yearly, the country faces a loss of $60 billion\nBrazilian reais (approximately $11,3 billion). Fraudulent bank accounts allow the\ncybercriminal to sign loan contracts and contract debts in another person’s name. These\nactivities do not only affect the victim and the bank but also negatively impact the whole\ndynamic of DFS, implying further regulations that might hinder financial inclusion and positive\nuser experiences.\n\nFurthermore, malicious software variants are spread throughout Latina America. Previously\nthese malware variants were not originated in the region; however, new communities of\nSpanish and Portuguese-speaking hackers changed this reality.\n\n**Case studies**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Three-in-One: Mekotio, the Banking Trojan with Multiple Functions**\n\nNew hacker groups increasingly flourish in Latin America, creating their own communities of\nSpanish/Portuguese-speaking cybercriminals. Within these groups, banking trojans families\nare fairly common across the region. These malware variants are usually looking for private\nfinancial information from internet banking users. Yet a new form of banking trojan emerges:\n**variants that are looking for cryptocurrency. Mekotio is a fairly new malware variant, and**\nit is one example of this new type of banking trojan.\n\nFirst spotted in March 2018, the Mekotio campaign usually targets South American\n[countries. Over 50% of their attacks target Chile, around 30% target Brazil, 12% target](https://www.tudocelular.com/seguranca/noticias/n160142/mekotio-brasil-dados-bancarios-america-latina.html)\nColombia; Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, and Bolivia are minor targets. More recently, though,\nMexico has also become a target for Mekotio campaigns. Their targets are 51 financial\ninstitutions distributed across the above-mentioned countries.\n\nTheir infection vectors are phishing emails with malicious links. These emails mimic official\ngovernmental agencies, and the message is usually about taxes and receipts. When the\nuser clicks on the malicious link, the webpage requests the user to download a .zip file, and\nthe malware variant then infects the machines.\n\n[Mekotio has three major functions: stealing banking information, cryptocurrencies, and](https://guiadoconcurso.com.br/virus-mekotio-rouba-dados-bancarios-e-criptomoedas/)\n**passwords stored in a web browser. Concerning banking information, Mekotio monitors**\naccessed webpages, and when the user accesses their banking page, the malware variant\ndisplays a fake banking website that mimics the official one. Upon insertion of personal\ncredentials, Mekotio sends this information to their server.\n\nIn order to steal stored passwords, the malware variant is designed to be executed as a user\napplication. The encryption mechanisms employed by password managers are designed to\nallow decryption only by the same user of the operating system that first encrypted it. As\nsuch, Mekotio can decrypt such information. These passwords might be linked to banking\ninformation or they can be related to other personal accounts, such as email, social media,\nstorage database, etc. Consequently, this is a highly threatening feature.\n\nTo conduct a cryptocurrency transaction, the user must have the receiver’s address in their\ncryptocurrency wallet. So these addresses are usually copied and pasted to the\ntransfer/deposit area. When the user’s machine is infected by Mekotio, the address pasted to\nthe transfer/deposit area will not correspond to the intended copied address. However, the\nuser will usually not note such a difference and will carry on with the operation; consequently,\nthe cybercriminal will receive the cryptocurrencies, instead of the intended receiver.\n\nIf the cybercriminals behind Mekotio are interested in cryptocurrencies, it means that these\nactors are targeting specific individual users, not any person. It means that these\ncybercriminals somehow monitor cryptocurrency users to target them specifically.\n\n_Mitigation Note_\n\n\n-----\n\nSince their infection vector is mainly phishing emails, cybersecurity best practices must\nbe employed to avoid infection. These measures include not opening\nsuspicious/unknown emails, and especially not clicking on any link contained in these\nemails. The same is valid for files contained in these unidentified emails.\n\nSystematically running anti-virus solutions is also of great importance, so even if the\nmachines get infected, the user can still be safe.\n\nConcerning cryptocurrency theft, it is essential to always check the cryptocurrency\nwallet and to verify if the address in the transaction area is indeed the intended receiver\nof the cryptocurrency deposit/transfer.\n\n**WannaHydra, 3-in-1 Brazilian Banking Trojan**\n\nThe WannaCry ransomware global campaign in 2017 seems to have left its legacy. After its\nmassive attack three years ago, WannaLocker, a mobile adaptation of WannaCry emerged.\nYet, this was not the final stage of the evolution of this malware family. WannaHydra is a new\nmalware variant that draws on the WannaCry-inspired WannaLocker, but with added\nmalicious functions.\n\nSo far, WannaHydra has only been identified in Brazil, but it definitely has the potential to\nspread elsewhere and cause great damage as its predecessors did.\n\nThe newly designed WannaHydra is a malware variant that affects iOS and Android users in\na campaign that targets exclusively Brazilian online banking clients. Three banks have been\nidentified as targets of the malware variant: Itaú, Santander, and Banco do Brasil. The most\nimportant and distinctive feature of WannaHydra is the fact that it combines three types of\nattack in just one malware variant: WannaHydra displays features, at the same time, of a\n**remote-access-Trojan (RAT) malware, spyware, and ransomware. All of these**\ncharacteristics combined in one solid banking Trojan. In fact, WannaHydra has the same\nUser Interface as WannaCry in its ransomware module, but, as above-cited, it has more\ncapabilities than its predecessor.\n\nIt is not confirmed how the malware variant infects mobile phones. Yet, as WannaHydra\nmimics official online banking apps, the most probable infection vector is through download\nin unofficial app stores or malicious links. Then, WannaHydra’s modus operandi is the one\nthat follows: once the app has been installed on the victim’s phone, the malware variant\nexecutes its banking Trojan function and delivers a warning to the victim, alleging a problem\nin the user’s bank account. It then portrays an interface that mimics the official bank’s app\nand requires some login information. This information might include the user’s social security\nnumber, credit/debit card number, and password - and this sort of information is not usually\nrequired by authentic banking apps. When the user provides this information, the\ncybercriminals behind WannaHydra get access to the victim’s bank account.\n\n\n-----\n\n[After this first data breach, WannaHydra activates additional functions. The first one](https://canaltech.com.br/hacker/wannahydra-avast-encontra-novo-malware-bancario-para-dispositivos-moveis-143101)\nactivated is the spyware function, and the malware variant carries on collecting all sorts of\npersonal information from the victim. This information may include GPS location, microphone\nrecording, storage media, call logging, SMS, hardware information, among others. This sort\nof data is used for ransomware attacks: WannaHydra utilizes a Portuguese version of\nWannaLocker, which, additionally to all the above-cited breached information, also has the\ncapability to activate the smartphone’s camera and take pictures. The device is then\nencrypted and a ransomware attack takes place.\n\nDue to the novelty of the malware variant, it has not been disclosed how much money is\ndemanded in ransom payment. Another still unknown information is the number of victims\naffected by WannaHydra.\n\n_Mitigation Note_\n\n[Recent research in Brazil has found that 30% of Brazilian users cannot identify fake](https://www.cisoadvisor.com.br/malware-feito-para-o-brasil-mira-em-clientes-do-santander-itau-inter-e-bb/)\nbanking app interfaces that mimic official ones, mostly assuming it to be authentic. This\nis a piece of alarming information that illustrates the potential damage these apps can\ncause.\n\nTo mitigate such a problem, a few actions can be taken. The first and most basic one is\nto never click on suspect/unknown links - and this step can mitigate diverse cyber\nthreats. It is important also to only download apps (especially banking ones) via official\nstores, which are constantly scanned for malicious applications. For Android users, it is\nalso possible to activate Google Play Protect, a security function of the Play Store that\nscans all installed apps for potential malicious hidden software variants. Overall, for all\nusers, it is absolutely mandatory to employ security software solutions such as antivirus\nand firewalls that will constantly scan the phone and will keep the device, the user, and\nits private data safe from cybercriminals.\n\n**BRata, the New Real-time Surveillance Brazilian Trojan**\n\nBRata, or Brazilian Android Rat (remote access tool), a new malware family that already\ncounts with more than 20 variants.\n\nThe malware was first detected in January 2019 and its distinguishable feature is the ability\nto remote control the victim’s mobile phone in real-time. The malware family mimics a\nWhatsApp update version, WhatsApp v2.0, and it has been downloaded over 10,000 times\nfrom Google Play Store in one year. As the name suggests, the malware family’s creators\nare Brazilian. They target Brazilian Android users - users of Android 5.0 or more recent\noperational versions. The fake app has been deleted from the Play Store, and its developer\nhas been banned from the platform; however, the malware variants may still be employed,\n\n\n-----\n\nsince they also use other infection spread vectors such as push notifications on\ncompromised webpages, messages delivered via WhatsApp or SMS, and sponsored links in\nGoogle searches.\n\nBRata is a financial malware that targets users, not the banks themselves, and it has great\npotential to be employed against other industries. The malware is designed to steal banking\ninformation from mobile devices, rather than target specific bank systems.\n\nOnce the victim’s mobile phone is infected, the malware surveils the device in real-time.\nBRata allows the controller to read the victim’s emails and messages, to control phone calls,\nto see browsing history, to access media, and it also can allegedly exploit the device’s\ncamera and microphone. All of these functionalities are initiated through keylogging, which is\na malicious record of keystrokes used to steal the information inserted by the user on the\ndevice. However, the malware also resorts to \"living off the land\" tactics exploiting in-built\ntools to surveil the victim’s phone: it explores Android’s Accessibility Service, so it can\ninteract with other applications present on the victim’s mobile device. Using the app’s\npermissions, the malware controller can access the device’s screen, keeping a real-time\nsurveillance tactic that enhances the information theft capabilities of the controller.\n\nThe real-time surveillance feature allows the trojan to turn off the device’s screen in order to\nperform actions without the user’s knowledge. So far the main use for BRata is the theft of\nbanking credential login information, and two-factor authentication tokens. However, due to\nthe trojan's vast capacities, it may likely evolve into another type of malicious variant, used\nfor extortion-related threats or even ransomware attacks.\n\nThe Latin American region is the first potential target of BRata: 81% of the region uses\nAndroid; against only 17% of iOS users. However, so far BRata infection has not been\nidentified in any other country. Yet, BRata is being sold in WhatsApp and Telegram groups\nfor R$3,000 (around $560).\n\n_Mitigation Note_\n\nThe main infection vector of BRata has been the download of WhatsApp fake updates.\nYet to update any app, it is not necessary to download a new version; instead, the\nlegitimate app will warn the user about updates available and then proceed.\n\nIt is crucial to review the app’s requested permissions. If the app requests permission\nto access too many functionalities that are not related to its operational necessity, the\nuser shall be cautious and question the legitimacy of such an app. Having any antivirus solution is also a good key to keep a mobile device safe from malware variants\nthat will harm the user’s privacy.\n\n**Tetrade: The Internationalization of Brazilian Banking Trojan Families**\n\n\n-----\n\nA new trend in the global cyber scene is the Tetrade: four Brazilian banking malware variants\nthat were previously only employed nationally, but that are currently being employed in\nattacks in other Latin American countries, and even in European ones. The four banking\ntrojan families are Guildma, Javali, Melcoz, and Grandoreiro.\n\nBrazilian banking trojans were timidly being employed only in Brazil up to 2011, but from that\nyear on, they have been employed in other Latin American countries, and also in Europe.\nThere is a forecast that soon enough they will be also employed in the US and China. Since\nlate 2019, [3,500 Tetrade attacks have been registered worldwide: targets were located in](https://www.criptofacil.com/criminosos-brasil-roubam-bitcoin-mundo-todo-usando-malware/)\nBrazil, Chile, Mexico, Portugal, and Spain. After going international, Brazilian cybercriminals\nhave started recruiting international partners: the server’s owners provide access to a botnet\nthat sells the software to international criminals - so they can also perpetrate attacks and\nhave access to the stolen money. Consequently, not only the attacks are profitable, but\nBrazilian hackers have also been adopting the idea of MaaS (malware-as-a-service).\n\nAmong the four trojans identified in the Tetrade, Guildma (also known as Astaroth) is the\noldest running malware family. It has been active at least from 2015 on, and it uses phishing\nemails with the malware in compressed format as infection vectors. After infection, Guildma\nconnects to a YouTube channel or a Facebook page where it retrieves an encrypted text with\nthe link to the command-and-control server, so the trojan can receive directives and to where\nit can send stolen data for storage. As a banking trojan, Guildma can perform very specific\nfunctions related to online banking operations: through Virtual Network Computing (a\ndesktop-sharing system), it gains full webpage navigation control; it can request SMS tokens,\nQR code validation, and other transactions.\n\nThe second trojan family is Javali, active since November 2017, which targets bank\ncustomers from Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries. However, it also targets\ncryptocurrency websites (Bittrex, for example), and payment tools (Mercado Pago, for\nexample). It operates similarly to Guildma, resorting to phishing emails to infect machines;\nand it also uses YouTube to host the communication between the malware variant and the\ncommand-and-control server.\n\nMelcoz is active internationally since at least 2018 and has been targeting Spanish-speaking\ncountries such as Mexico, Chile, and Spain. Since Brazilian coders speak a different\nlanguage, this international expansion has likely been made possible by a partnership with\nlocal groups of coders and mules to deal with stolen money. Melcoz is a variant of a RAT\n(Remote Access Trojan), and it also spreads via phishing emails. The trojan monitors\n\n\n-----\n\nbrowser activities (be it Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or others) to spot online banking\nsessions. Once the code finds it, it displays an overlay window in front of the user’s browser\nto manipulate the banking information in the background.\n\nFinally, Grandoreiro trojan is active since at least 2016, and from 2019 on it has started being\nemployed abroad - especially in Mexico and Spain. It spreads through spam: usually using\nfake pop-ups to get their victims to insert personal credentials; but lately, phishing emails\nCovid-19-related are also a tool for the spread of the malware. Once the Trojan infects the\ndevice, its backdoor manipulates the victim’s browser, records keystrokes, and may even\nblock access to certain websites. Finally, Grandoreiro has also been employed as a MaaS.\n\n_Mitigation Note_\n\nThe four trojan families that constitute Tetrade usually rely on email phishing\ncampaigns to infect machines. As such, the first recommendation is to be always\ncautious with unknown incoming emails. Checking the authenticity of this email is an\nimportant step to mitigate malicious emails. If the receiver does not recognize the\nauthenticity of the email, it is essential not to open any attached files, which may\ncontain any sort of malware variant.\n\nThe use of multi-factor authentication methods increases the safety of the user through\nthe use of different security layers. Resorting to password management tools is also\ngood mitigation to the keylogging issue since it allows the user not to physically type\npasswords.\n\nFinally, regularly running security scans on the user’s machine is also a vital step to\nmitigate the infection; if prevention fails, the user can still rely on quick incident\nresponse capabilities.\n\n**Cybercrimes Targeting Financial Institutions**\n\n[Globally, the financial sector is the second most affected sector by cybercrime - behind only](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/financial-services-threat-of-cybersecurity/69023/)\nretail. This reality is not different in LATAM. Banks and other financial institutions face\nchallenges that regard fraud, be it due to identity theft (as discussed above) or trojan and\nbackdoor mechanisms. The Emotet botnet (targeting mostly banks) presence in the region\nrepresents 45% of the global employment of the tool. In general, in 2019, LATAM suffered 85\nbillion attack attempts in regards to malware variants and botnet activity, the most affected\ncountry is Brazil with 24 billion cyberattacks in a year.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow some fraud schemes are discussed to illustrate the inventiveness employed by Latin\nAmerican cybercriminals when targeting banks and other financial institutions. The lesson\ndrawn from these examples is that such institutions must keep track of intelligence data in\norder to stay one step ahead of the cybercriminal world, otherwise, the financial losses\nrelated to fraud schemes do not seem to be decreasing anytime soon.\n\n**Case studies**\n\n**BINero Fraud**\n\nThe BINero fraud is a strong trend in Spanish-speaking countries, especially Mexico, and it\nwas first detected in 2015. Due to the strong Binero community in social media (not only in\nDark Web forums), there are numerous tutorials available online, which allows more and\n[more people to commit this kind of fraud - many of which are minors.](https://www.mexicanist.com/l/bineros-who-are-they-and-how-do-thieves-operate-the-number-of-bank-cards-in-mexico/)\n\nThe BINero fraud consists of finding a fraudulent BIN (bank identification number) in order\nto proceed with online payments. Every card has at least 16 digits, and the initial 4 to 6 digits\ncorrespond to the BIN, which identifies the issuing bank and the type of card. The BINero\nfraud, then, aims to discover BINs that get improperly validated by online payment\nprocessors. Through manual trial and error, the criminals try to identify websites where there\nis a disbalance between the bank behind the BIN and the online retailer type of card\nvalidation. These vulnerabilities are explored by cybercriminals: once this combination of\nwebsite and fraudulent BIN is discovered, fraudsters use special programs that can generate\nthe remaining information (the remaining card’s digits, CVV, expiration date) to complete the\ntransaction.\n\nThese fraudsters avoid using real cards; instead, they exploit system vulnerabilities to target\nbanks and companies, not banking users. Using authentic cards is also a possibility for this\ncommunity, but it is not their main tactic. As a result, in Mexico, for example, the BINero fraud\n[produces financial losses that mount up to 12,500 million Mexican pesos (around $675](https://www.mexicanist.com/l/bineros-who-are-they-and-how-do-thieves-operate-the-number-of-bank-cards-in-mexico/)\nmillion) per year. These losses are shared between banks and retailers, and it hardly affects\n[users. The Spanish-speaking community of BINero fraudsters has a specific vocabulary: if it](https://www.mibolsillo.com/tips/Como-operan-los-bineros-y-como-protegerte-de-sus-fraudes-20190613-0021.html)\nis the case to use authentic cards, for example, they call it quemar (to burn); and they usually\ndo not steal large amounts of money, instead, they call their small thefts hormiga (ant).\n\nThe BINero fraudsters mostly use this tactic to purchase immediate delivery services, mainly\nentertainment-related, such as streaming services - Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, etc.\n\n_Mitigation Note_\n\n\n-----\n\nIf it is the case that one of the combinations generated by the special software results\nin the use of an authentic card, this means that a user was a victim of fraud. To avoid\nthat, some recommendations might improve the safety of users. The first one is to\nconstantly check the account balance and transactions to try to spot any unidentified\nmovement as soon as possible - and communicate this incident to the bank. The user\ncan also activate mobile phone notifications to keep track of the use of their personal\ncard in real-time.\n\nSome banks offer alternative cards, related to the user’s main account, exclusively for\nInternet use - and they also block the physical card for online transactions. This type of\nonline card minimizes the possibility of fraud since the banking app constantly shifts the\nCVV - which diminishes the risk of fraud and improves the user’s safety.\n\n**Ploutus, the First Latin American Jackpotting Malware Variant**\n\nJackpotting malware variants are specifically designed for automated teller machines\n(ATMs). The objective is to make the machine release money on the command of the\nmalware variant activation. After the infection, there are two modalities of attack: remote and\nin person. The first one provides more safety to the cybercriminal, who activates the malware\nvariant from a distance, and a money mule collects the money. One of the first campaigns of\nthe genre is known as Ploutus, a common jackpotting attack that spread from Mexico to the\nrest of Latin America.\n\nTargeting the banks, not their users, jackpotting attacks are a nightmare to Latin American\nfinancial institutions. Since its launch, in 2013, Ploutus has produced a financial loss that\nmounts up to [$450 million. Its first malware version was delivered through CD-rooms, but it](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/tecnologia/Virus-que-atraca-los-cajeros-automaticos-vuelve-recargado-20170114-0013.html)\nhas evolved a few times so it could be delivered through USB tethering. Ploutus has been\nconsidered the most sophisticated variant of ATM malware, especially because it could be\nactivated through SMS messages, with no need for a credit/debit card. Ploutus malware is\n[capable of withdrawing 400 money bills from each of the available denominations for around](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/tecnologia/Malware-Ploutus-que-robo-1200-mdp-a-cajeros-de-Mexico-aun-con-vida-20150723-0054.html)\n3 hours.\n\n[Ploutus has evolved from its initial malicious coding. The latest version identified, Ploutus-D,](https://tiinside.com.br/29/01/2017/nova-variavel-do-malware-ploutus-afeta-para-atms-na-america-latina/)\nalso known in the Spanish-speaking hacker scene as Piolin (Tweety, the yellow canary\ncartoon), is being employed not only in Mexico but also in other American countries. Piolin\ninteracts with multi-vendor ATM Software Kalignite (KAL), a platform that runs in over 80\ncountries, which includes, among others, the US, Chile, Colombia, Peru: the cyber-threat is\ngetting international.\n\nDue to coding components written in Spanish, and also due to the area of attacks, Ploutus\nand its later variants are believed to have originated in a Latin American country. It is most\nlikely that the jackpotting malware variant is indeed Mexican, or, as some have suggested, a\n[partnership between Mexican and Venezuelan hackers. These cybercriminals did not exploit](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/tecnologia/Virus-que-atraca-los-cajeros-automaticos-vuelve-recargado-20170114-0013.html)\n\n\n-----\n\na system vulnerability to develop their malicious code; instead, they have had access to the\nsoftware code of the infected machines - be it through physical theft of an ATM machine or a\npartnership with a software developer employee.\n\n_Mitigation_\n\nSince there has to be a physical component for the machine compromise, an infection\ncan be stopped through the use of hardware protection tools - blocking the use of USB\nor keyboard external devices. Using full disk encryption is also an important step to\navoid software manipulation by external systems.\n\nEven in the case that infection could not be avoided, employing further protection tools\nmight mitigate the issue of jackpotting malware variants. Employing an application\nwhitelisting might protect the system of running the launcher and the malware itself in\nthe ATM machine.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe hacker community in Latin America grows in parallel to the spread of the Internet in the\nregion. The integration of such communities in the digital domain creates the environment for\nthe flourishing of e-commerce: the region is the second-fastest-growing e-commerce market\n[in the world. Last year, retail e-commerce sales mounted up to $70 billion, and by the end of](https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/)\n2020, the projections are that the market will grow up to $83,6 billion. Furthermore,\nconcomitantly to the Internet penetration in LATAM, the region experienced a regional\neconomic growth that provoked a financial inclusion trend in the region. Financial inclusion\n[translates into the following statistics: in 2011, only 39,4% of the Latin American population](https://ufa.worldbank.org/en/global-progress#lac)\nhad bank accounts; in 2017, this percentage grew to 55,1%.\n\nNew hacker groups increasingly flourish in Latin America, creating their own communities of\nSpanish/Portuguese-speaking cybercriminals. Within these groups, banking trojans families\nare fairly common across the region. These malware variants are usually looking for private\nfinancial information from internet banking users. With the rising popularity of\ncryptocurrencies, banking trojan families are no longer targeting only formal banking\ninstitutions and their users. The design of banking trojan variants increasingly includes\nfunctions related to cryptocurrency wallets. In Latin America, where these currencies are\nprogressively popular, fraud schemes that encompass cryptocurrencies are a trend. Due to\nthe untraceable feature of these currencies, digital currencies are useful tools for moneylaundering, drug dealing, and any sort of frauding scheme.\n\nSuch developments will likely be a major trend for the region's economic & digital security in\nthe coming years.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Advanced Intelligence is an elite threat prevention firm.
