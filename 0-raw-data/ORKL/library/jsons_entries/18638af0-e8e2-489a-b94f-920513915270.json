Karakurt actors    - Enforce multifactor authentication.\nhave employed a variety of tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges\nfor defense and mitigation. Karakurt victims have not reported encryption of compromised machines\nor files; rather, Karakurt actors have claimed to steal data and threatened to auction it off or release it\nto the public unless they receive payment of the demanded ransom. Known ransom demands have\nranged from $25,000 to $13,000,000 in Bitcoin, with payment deadlines typically set to expire within a\nweek of first contact with the victim.\n\nKarakurt actors have typically provided screenshots or copies of stolen file directories as proof of\nstolen data. Karakurt actors have contacted victims’ employees, business partners, and clients\n\n[[T1591.002] with harassing emails and phone calls to pressure the victims to cooperate. The emails](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1591/002/)\nhave contained examples of stolen data, such as social security numbers, payment accounts, private\ncompany emails, and sensitive business data belonging to employees or clients. Upon payment of\nransoms, Karakurt actors have provided some form of proof of deletion of files and, occasionally, a\nbrief statement explaining how the initial intrusion occurred.\n\n_To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact_\n_your local FBI field office at_ _[www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field,When available, please include the following](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field)_\n_information regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people_\n_affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a_\n_designated point of contact.

The domain and IP address originally hosting the website went offline in the](https://karakurt[.]group/)\nspring 2022. The website is no longer accessible on the open internet, but has been reported to be\nlocated elsewhere in the deep web and on the dark web. As of May 2022, the website contained\nseveral terabytes of data purported to belong to victims across North America and Europe, along with\nseveral “press releases” naming victims who had not paid or cooperated, and instructions for\nparticipating in victim data “auctions.”\n\n[Click here](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-152A.stix.xml) for STIX.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n### Initial Intrusion\n\nKarakurt does not appear to target any specific sectors, industries, or types of victims. During\n[reconnaissance [TA0043], Karakurt actors appear to obtain access to victim devices primarily:](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0043/)\n\n     - [By purchasing stolen login credentials [T1589.001] [T1589.002];](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1589/001/)\n\n     - Via cooperating partners in the cybercrime community, who provide Karakurt access to\nalready compromised victims; or\n\n     - Through buying access to already compromised victims via third-party intrusion broker\n[networks [T1589.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1589/001/)\n\n`o` **Note: Intrusion brokers, or intrusion broker networks, are malicious individual cyber**\n\nactors or groups of actors who use a variety of tools and skills to obtain initial access\nto—and often create marketable persistence within—protected computer systems.\nIntrusion brokers then sell access to these compromised computer systems to other\ncybercriminal actors, such as those engaged in ransomware, business email\ncompromise, corporate and government espionage, etc.\n\n[Common intrusion vulnerabilities exploited for initial access [TA001] in Karakurt events include the](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/tactics/TA0001/)\nfollowing:\n\n     - [Outdated SonicWall SSL VPN appliances [T1133] are vulnerable to multiple recent CVEs](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1133/)\n\n     - [Log4j “Log4Shell” Apache Logging Services vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) [T1190]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1190/)\n\n     - [Phishing and spearphishing [T1566]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1566/)\n\n     - [Malicious macros within email attachments [T1566.001]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1566/001/)\n\n     - [Stolen virtual private network (VPN) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials [T1078]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1078/)\n\n     - [Outdated Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN appliances [T1133]/firewall appliances [T1190] are](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1133/)\nvulnerable to multiple recent CVEs\n\n     - Outdated and/or unserviceable Microsoft Windows Server instances\n\n#### Network Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Persistence, and Exfiltration\nUpon developing or obtaining access to a compromised system, Karakurt actors deploy Cobalt Strike\n[beacons to enumerate a network [T1083], install Mimikatz to pull plain-text credentials [T1078], use](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1083/)\n[AnyDesk to obtain persistent remote control [T1219], and utilize additional situation-dependent tools](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1219/)\nto elevate privileges and move laterally within a network.\n\n\n**TLP: WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury | FinCEN\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP: WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury | FinCEN\n\nKarakurt actors then compress (typically with 7zip) and exfiltrate large sums of data—and, in many\ncases, entire network-connected shared drives in volumes exceeding 1 terabyte (TB)—using open\n[source applications and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) services [T1048], such as Filezilla, and cloud](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1048/)\n[storage services including rclone and Mega.nz [T1567.002].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/techniques/T1567/002/)\n\n### Extortion\n\nFollowing the exfiltration of data, Karakurt actors present the victim with ransom notes by way of\n“readme.txt” files, via emails sent to victim employees over the compromised email networks, and\nemails sent to victim employees from external email accounts. The ransom notes reveal the victim\nhas been hacked by the “Karakurt Team” and threaten public release or auction of the stolen data.\nThe instructions include a link to a TOR URL with an access code. Visiting the URL and inputting the\naccess code open a chat application over which victims can negotiate with Karakurt actors to have\ntheir data deleted.\n\nKarakurt victims have reported extensive harassment campaigns by Karakurt actors in which\nemployees, business partners, and clients receive numerous emails and phone calls warning the\nrecipients to encourage the victims to negotiate with the actors to prevent the dissemination of victim\ndata. These communications often included samples of stolen data—primarily personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), such as employment records, health records, and financial business records.\n\nVictims who negotiate with Karakurt actors receive a “proof of life,” such as screenshots showing file\ntrees of allegedly stolen data or, in some cases, actual copies of stolen files. Upon reaching an\nagreement on the price of the stolen data with the victims, Karakurt actors provided a Bitcoin\naddress—usually a new, previously unused address—to which ransom payments could be made.\nUpon receiving the ransom, Karakurt actors provide some form of alleged proof of deletion of the\nstolen files, such as a screen recording of the files being deleted, a deletion log, or credentials for a\nvictim to log into a storage server and delete the files themselves.\n\nAlthough Karakurt’s primary extortion leverage is a promise to delete stolen data and keep the\nincident confidential, some victims reported Karakurt actors did not maintain the confidentiality of\nvictim information after a ransom was paid. Note: The U.S. government strongly discourage the\npayment of any ransom to Karakurt threat actors, or any cyber criminals promising to delete stolen\nfiles in exchange for payments.\n\nIn some cases, Karakurt actors have conducted extortion against victims previously attacked by other\nransomware variants. In such cases, Karakurt actors likely purchased or otherwise obtained\npreviously stolen data. Karakurt actors have also targeted victims at the same time these victims were\nunder attack by other ransomware actors. In such cases, victims received ransom notes from multiple\nransomware variants simultaneously, suggesting Karakurt actors purchased access to a\ncompromised system that was also sold to another ransomware actor.\n\nKarakurt actors have also exaggerated the degree to which a victim had been compromised and the\nvalue of data stolen. For example, in some instances, Karakurt actors claimed to steal volumes of\ndata far beyond the storage capacity of compromised systems or claimed to steal data that did not\nbelong to the victim.\n\n\n**TLP: WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury | FinCEN\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP: WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury | FinCEN\n\n### Indicators of Compromise \n\n\n**TLP: WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury | FinCEN\n\n\n##### Email\n\n\nmark.hubert1986@gmail.com; karakurtlair@gmail.com;\npersonal.information.reveal@gmail.com; ripidelfun1986@protonmail.com;\ngapreappballye1979@protonmail.com; confedicial.datas.download@protonmail.com;\narmada.mitchell94@protonmail.com\n\n_Protonmail email accounts in the following formats:_\n\nvictimname_treasure@protonmail.com\n\nvictimname_jewels@protonmail.com\n\nvictimname_files@protonmail.com\n\n|Tools|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Onion site|https://omx5iqrdbsoitf3q4xexrqw5r5tfw7vp3vl3li3lfo7saabxazshnead.onion|\n|Tools|Rclone.exe;; AnyDesk.exe; Mimikatz|\n|Ngrok|SSH tunnel application SHA256 - 3e625e20d7f00b6d5121bb0a71cfa61f92d658bcd61af2cf5397e0ae28f4ba56|\n|DLLs masquerading as legitimate Microsoft binaries to System32|Mscxxx.dll: SHA1 - c33129a680e907e5f49bcbab4227c0b02e191770 Msuxxx.dll: SHA1 - 030394b7a2642fe962a7705dcc832d2c08d006f5|\n|Msxsl.exe|Legitimate Microsoft Command Line XSL Transformation Utility SHA1 - 8B516E7BE14172E49085C4234C9A53C6EB490A45|\n|dllhosts.exe|Rclone SHA1 - fdb92fac37232790839163a3cae5f37372db7235|\n|rclone.conf|Rclone configuration file|\n|filter.txt|Rclone file extension filter file|\n|c.bat|UNKNOWN|\n|3.bat|UNKNOWN|\n|Potential malicious document|SHA1 - 0E50B289C99A35F4AD884B6A3FFB76DE4B6EBC14|\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP: WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury | FinCEN\n\n|Tools|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Potential malicious document|SHA1 - 7E654C02E75EC78E8307DBDF95E15529AAAB5DFF|\n|Malicious text file|SHA1 - 4D7F4BB3A23EAB33A3A28473292D44C5965DDC95|\n|Malicious text file|SHA1 - 10326C2B20D278080AA0CA563FC3E454A85BB32F|\n\n\n**TLP: WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury | FinCEN\n\n\n##### Cobalt Strike hashes\n\n\nSHA256 563BC09180FD4BB601380659E922C3F7198306E0CAEBE99CD1D88CD2C3FD5C1B\n\nSHA256 5E2B2EBF3D57EE58CADA875B8FBCE536EDCBBF59ACC439081635C88789C67ACA\n\nSHA256 712733C12EA3B6B7A1BCC032CC02FD7EC9160F5129D9034BF9248B27EC057BD2\n\nSHA256 563BC09180FD4BB601380659E922C3F7198306E0CAEBE99CD1D88CD2C3FD5C1B\n\nSHA256 5E2B2EBF3D57EE58CADA875B8FBCE536EDCBBF59ACC439081635C88789C67ACA\n\nSHA256 712733C12EA3B6B7A1BCC032CC02FD7EC9160F5129D9034BF9248B27EC057BD2\n\nSHA1 - 86366bb7646dcd1a02700ed4be4272cbff5887af\n\n|Ransom note text sample:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|1.|Here's the deal We breached your internal network and took control over all of your systems.|\n|2.|We analyzed and located each piece of more-or-less important files while spending weeks inside.|\n|3.|We exfiltrated anything we wanted (xxx GB (including Private & Confidential information, Intellectual Property, Customer Information and most important Your TRADE SECRETS)|\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP: WHITE** FBI | CISA | Treasury | FinCEN\n\n|Ransom note text sample:|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|FAQ:|Who the hell are you?|\n||The Karakurt Team.
