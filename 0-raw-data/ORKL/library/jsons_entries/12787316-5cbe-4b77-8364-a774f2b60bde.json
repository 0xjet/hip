    "plain_text": "# Cybercrime underground flush with shipping companies’ credentials\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/shipping-companies-ransomware-credentials](https://intel471.com/blog/shipping-companies-ransomware-credentials)**\n\nThe actors responsible for selling these credentials range from newcomers to the most\nprolific network access brokers that Intel 471 tracks.\n\nNov 01, 2021\n\nOne of the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is the havoc it has wreaked on the\n[global supply chain. There have been extreme fluctuations in the availability of goods, ports](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/economists-expect-shipping-problems-to-linger-well-into-2022.html)\n[around the world are severely backlogged with full containers, and shipping and logistics](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supply-chain-issues-us-ports-backlog-holiday-shopping/)\n[companies are having trouble finding workers to transport cargo. It is a precarious situation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-02/a-trucking-crisis-has-the-u-s-looking-for-more-drivers-abroad)\nfor this sector, especially as the holiday season approaches.\n\nWith things as volatile as they are, a cybersecurity crisis at one of these logistics and shipping\ncompanies could have a calamitous impact on the global consumer economy. Over the past\nfew months, Intel 471 has observed network access brokers selling credentials or other forms\nof access to shipping and logistics companies on the cybercrime underground. These\ncompanies operate air, ground and maritime cargo transport on several continents that are\nresponsible for moving billions of dollars worth of goods around the world.\n\nThe actors responsible for selling these credentials range from newcomers to the most\nprolific network access brokers that Intel 471 tracks. These actors have obtained these\ncredentials by leveraging well-known vulnerabilities in remote access solutions like Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP), VPN, Citrix, and SonicWall, among others.\n\nAmong the advertisements observed by Intel 471:\n\n**Within the span of two weeks in July 2021, one new actor and one well-known**\naccess broker claimed to have access to a network owned by a Japanese container\ntransportation and shipping company. The new actor included the company’s\ncredentials in a dump of approximately 50 companies, allegedly all obtained via\ncompromised Citrix, Cisco, virtual private network (VPN) and/or remote desktop\nprotocol (RDP) accounts. The well-known actor claimed to have access to several\naccounts belonging to the company, but did not reveal how they were obtained.\n\n\n-----\n\n**In August 2021, one actor known to work with groups that have deployed Conti**\nransomware claimed access to corporate networks belonging to a U.S.-based\ntransportation management and trucking software supplier and a U.S.-based\ncommodity transportation services company. The actor gave the group access to an\nundisclosed botnet powered by malware that included a virtual network computing\n[(VNC) function. The group used the botnet to download and execute a Cobalt Strike](https://intel471.com/glossary#:~:text=WHAT%20IS%20VISHING%3F-,VNC,-Virtual%20network%20computing)\nbeacon on infected machines, so group members in charge of breaching computer\nnetworks received access directly via a Cobalt Strike beacon session.\n\n**In September 2021, an actor with ties to the FiveHands ransomware group claimed**\naccess to hundreds of companies, including a U.K.-based logistics company. It’s most\nlikely that access was obtained through a SonicWall vulnerability, given that FiveHands\n[is known to use that access to launch its ransomware attacks. Additionally in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomware-group-uses-sonicwall-zero-day-to-breach-networks/)\nSeptember, a new actor claimed to have gained access to a Bangladesh-based shipping\nand logistics company through a vulnerability in the PulseSecure VPN.\n\n**In October 2021, a newcomer to a well-known cybercrime forum claimed access to**\nthe network of a U.S.-based freight forwarding company, alleging that he had had local\nadministrator rights and could access 20 computers on the company’s network. The\nactor claimed he obtained the credentials through a path traversal vulnerability in\nFortinet’s FortiGate secure sockets layer (SSL) VPN web portal (CVE-2018-13379). Also\nin October, a newcomer on a different well-known cybercrime forum claimed access to\na Malaysian logistics company. Those credentials were part of a package that the actor\nwas selling for $5,000. It was unknown how he allegedly obtained those credentials.\n\nThe world has previously seen the economic damage that can come from a cyber attack on\nthe shipping and logistics industry. The NotPetya attack in 2017 devastated Danish shipping\n[and maritime giant Maersk, shutting down several of its ports and costing the company $300](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2017/06/28/la-port-terminal-still-closed/)\nmillion to replace systems damaged by the malware. Adam Banks, head of technology at\n[Maersk, told a business publication in 2019 that “there was 100 [percent] destruction of](https://www.i-cio.com/management/insight/item/maersk-springing-back-from-a-catastrophic-cyber-attack)\nanything based on Microsoft that was attached to the network.”\n\nWe have seen attackers try to go after ports this year. In August, suspected foreign\n[government-backed hackers breached a computer network at the Port of Houston, one of the](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/23/politics/suspected-foreign-hack-houston/index.html)\nlargest ports on the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, early detection of the incident thwarted any\nattempts to impede business operations.\n\nThose two incidents show that the logistics industry is constantly targeted, and the\nramifications of a cyberattack can have a crippling ripple effect on the global economy. At a\ntime when this sector is struggling to keep things operating, a successful attack could bring\nthis industry to a screeching halt, resulting in unforeseen dire consequences for every part of\nthe consumer economy. It's extremely beneficial that security teams in the shipping industry\n\n\n-----\n\nmonitor and track adversaries, their tools and malicious behavior to stop attacks from these\ncriminals. Proactively addressing vulnerabilities in times of high alert avoids further stress on\nalready constrained business operations.\n\n\n-----",
