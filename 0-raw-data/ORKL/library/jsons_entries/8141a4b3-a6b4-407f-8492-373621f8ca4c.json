The threat actor, an APT who we assess with high confidence\nsupports Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence collection efforts, established\nbackstopping for their credential phishing infrastructure by compromising a legitimate site of a highly\nregarded academic institution to deliver personalized credential harvesting pages disguised as\nregistration links. Identified targets included experts in Middle Eastern affairs from think tanks, senior\nprofessors from well-known academic institutions, and journalists specializing in Middle Eastern\ncoverage.\n\nThese connection attempts were detailed and extensive, often including lengthy conversations prior to\npresenting the next stage in the attack chain. Once the conversation was established, TA453 delivered a\n“registration link” to a legitimate but compromised website belonging to the University of London’s SOAS\nradio. The compromised site was configured to capture a variety of credentials. Of note, TA453 also\ntargeted the personal email accounts of at least one of their targets. In subsequent phishing emails,\nTA453 shifted their tactics and began delivering the registration link earlier in their engagement with the\ntarget without requiring extensive conversation. This operation, dubbed SpoofedScholars, represents one\nof the more sophisticated TA453 campaigns identified by Proofpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chatting with TA453\n\nIn early 2021, a TA453 persona, “Dr.Hanns Bjoern Kendel, Senior Teaching and Research Fellow at\nSOAS University in London,” used email address hannse.kendel4[@]gmail.com to solicit\nconversations with targets. The following is a brief summary of an example conversation observed by\nProofpoint Threat Research:\n\nTA453 sent an initial email trying to entice the target with a prospective invitation to an online conference\non “The US Security Challenges in the Middle East.” TA453 strived to connect with the individual via\nphone to discuss the invitation; however, after the target hedged and emphatically stated that they\nwanted a written proposal with the details, TA453 acquiesced with conference specifics. After a little back\nand forth that verified the target’s interest, TA453 provided a detailed invitation to the fake conference\n(Figure 1). The conversation concluded with TA453 attempting to get the target to connect\nvia videoconferencing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Fake conference invitation._\n\n## Conversation Analysis\n\nThroughout the conversation, Proofpoint identified a few interesting themes:\n\n\n-----\n\nTA453 demonstrates passable English skills and is open to voice communication via\nvideoconferencing.\nTA453 demonstrates an interest in mobile phone numbers, possibly for mobile malware or\nadditional phishing.\nTA453 repeatedly demonstrated a desire to connect with the target in real-time.\n\n## Personal Targeting\n\nIn addition to Hanns’ solicitations, at least one target received a credential harvesting email to their\npersonal email account. This attempt did not masquerade as Dr. Kendel but did still attempt to harvest\ncredentials from the target. Currently, Proofpoint does not have more information on this specific kill\nchain.\n\n## Campaign Breakdown\n\n**Targets**\n\nTA453 targets in Operation SpoofedScholars can be clustered into three main categories that are\nconsistent with the IRGC’s historical collection priorities.\n\nSenior think tank personnel\nJournalists focused on Middle Eastern affairs\nProfessors\n\nThese groupings consistently have information of interest to the Iranian government, including, but not\nlimited to, information about foreign policy, insights into Iranian dissident movements, and understanding\nof U.S. nuclear negotiations, and most of the identified targets have been previously targeted by\nTA453. Targeting appeared to be highly selective, with less than ten organizations targeted, according to\nProofpoint data.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nOnce TA453 established a time for the target to activate their invitation, the TA453 persona provided the\npersonalized link to the intended victim. The link led to a “Webinar Control Panel” on a legitimate but\ncompromised website belonging to University of London’s SOAS, a research institution. According to\nProofpoint research, while TA453 does appear to have elevated privileges allowing them to create\ncredential harvesting pages at soasradio[.]org, other pages on the site continue to host legitimate SOASaffiliated content.\n\nTA453 strengthened the credibility of the attempted credential harvest by utilizing personas masquerading\nas legitimate affiliates of SOAS to deliver the malicious links. The displayed webpage (Figure 2) offers\nusers the ability to use “OpenID” to log in with the following mail providers; Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,\niCloud, Outlook, AOL, mail.ru, Email, and Facebook. The website\nURI was hxxps://soasradio[.]org/connect/?memberemailid= [RedactedInitials of Target]-[String of\nalphanumeric characters].\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. SOAS displayed webpage._\n\nWhen a particular provider is clicked, a pop-up box (Figure 3) displays the actual credential phishing box.\nOf the options, Google, Microsoft, and Email buttons prefilled the target’s email address. Based on the\nvariety of email providers along with TA453’s insistence that the target log on when TA453 was online,\nProofpoint assesses that TA453 was planning on immediately validating the captured credentials\nmanually.\n\n_Figure 3. “AOL login window”_\n\nHanns Kendel was not the only SOAS scholar spoofed by\nTA453 during Operation SpoofedScholars. Months later, TA453 began spoofing Tolga Sinmazdemir,\nanother individual associated with SOAS. These emails solicited contributions to a “DIPS\nConference” and would have likely followed a similar kill chain discussed above. In midMay, TA453 returned, using a different email (hanse.kendel4[@]gmail.com) to recruit for a webinar.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attribution**\n\nAs discussed previously in Proofpoint’s research on TA453’s [BadBlood campaign, Proofpoint analysts](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/badblood-ta453-targets-us-and-israeli-medical-research-personnel-credential)\ncannot independently confirm that TA453 is part of the IRGC. However, the tactics and techniques used\nby the group and their overall targeting detected by Proofpoint is in line with IRGC intelligence collection\npriorities, which gives us high confidence in our assessment that TA453 operates in support of the\nIRGC. The IRGC, specifically the IRGC Intelligence Organization, collects intelligence and conducts\noperations in support of a variety of assigned responsibilities. According to the Meir Amit Intelligence and\n[Terrorism Information Center’s November 2020 report, some of the IRGC IO’s responsibilities include](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/en/the-intelligence-organization-of-the-irgc-a-major-iranian-intelligence-apparatus/)\nfoiling political subversion, combating western cultural penetration, and supporting the arrest of Iranian\ndual nationals.\n\nLikewise, attribution specifically for Operation SpoofedScholars is based on TTP similarities to previous\nTA453 campaigns and consistency with TA453’s historical targeting. TA453 often uses free email\nproviders to spoof individuals familiar to their targets to increase the likelihood of successful compromise.\nAdditionally, as previously discussed, TA453 concentrates their credential phishing to specific individuals\nof interest to collect intelligence through exfiltration of sensitive email and contacts or initial access for\nfuture phishing campaigns.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\nFor specific mitigations against Operation SpoofedScholars, Proofpoint recommends investigating\nnetwork traffic to soasradio[.]org, specifically URIs starting with hxxps://soasradio[.]org/connect/?\nmemberemailid=. Additionally, emails\nfrom hanse.kendel4[@]gmail.com, hannse.kendel4[@]gmail.com, and t.sinmazdemir32[@]gmail.com should\nbe considered suspect and investigated.\n\nBroader mitigation efforts against TA453 campaigns include increased awareness and investigation of\nunusual communication from professional contacts. Academics, journalists, and think\ntank scholars should practice caution and verify the identity of the individuals offering them unique\nopportunities, especially if those opportunities occur virtually. Using multifactor authentication provides\nanother layer of protection against TA453 credential harvesting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTA453 illegally obtained access to a website belonging to a world class academic institution to leverage\nthe compromised infrastructure to harvest the credentials of their intended targets. The use of\nlegitimate, but compromised, infrastructure represents an increase in TA453’s sophistication and will\nalmost certainly be reflected in future campaigns. TA453 continues to iterate, innovate, and collect in\nsupport of IRGC collection priorities. While some of the identified selectors no longer appear to be active\nin TA453 operations, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that TA453 will continue to spoof\nscholars around the world in support of TA453’s intelligence collection operations in support of Iranian\ngovernment interests. Academics, journalists, and think tank personnel should practice caution and verify\nthe identity of the individuals offering them unique opportunities.\n\n**ET** **Signature**\n\n2033317 - ET Malware Operation SpoofedScholars Activity (GET)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
