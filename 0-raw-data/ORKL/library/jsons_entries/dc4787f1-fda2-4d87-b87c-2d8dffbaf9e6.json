Technical details (PDF)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2020/10/07080558/MosaicRegressor_Technical-details.pdf)\n\nUEFI (or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) has become a prominent technology that is\nembedded within designated chips on modern day computer systems. Replacing the legacy\nBIOS, it is typically used to facilitate the machine’s boot sequence and load the operating\nsystem, while using a feature-rich environment to do so. At the same time, it has become the\ntarget of threat actors to carry out exceptionally persistent attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne such attack has become the subject of our research, where we found a compromised\nUEFI firmware image that contained a malicious implant. This implant served as means to\ndeploy additional malware on the victim computers, one that we haven’t come across thus\nfar. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second known public case where malicious\nUEFI firmware in use by a threat actor was found in the wild.\n\nThroughout this blog we will elaborate on the following key findings:\n\nWe discovered rogue UEFI firmware images that were modified from their benign\ncounterpart to incorporate several malicious modules;\nThe modules were used to drop malware on the victim machines. This malware was\npart of a wider malicious framework that we dubbed MosaicRegressor;\nComponents from that framework were discovered in a series of targeted attacks\npointed towards diplomats and members of an NGO from Africa, Asia and Europe, all\nshowing ties in their activity to North Korea;\nCode artefacts in some of the framework’s components and overlaps in C&C\ninfrastructure used during the campaign suggest that a Chinese-speaking actor is\nbehind these attacks, possibly having connections to groups using the Winnti\nbackdoor;\n\n[The attack was found with the help of Firmware Scanner, which has been integrated into](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/wiki-section/products/anti-rootkit-and-remediation-technology)\nKaspersky products since the beginning of 2019. This technology was developed to\nspecifically detect threats hiding in the ROM BIOS, including UEFI firmware images.\n\n## Current State of the Art\n\nBefore we dive deep into our findings, let us have a quick recap of what UEFI is and how it\nwas leveraged for attacks thus far. In a nutshell, UEFI is a specification that constitutes the\nstructure and operation of low-level platform firmware, so as to allow the operating system to\ninteract with it at various stages of its activity.\n\nThis interaction happens most notably during the boot phase, where UEFI firmware\nfacilitates the loading of the operating system itself. That said, it can also occur when the OS\nis already up and running, for example in order to update the firmware through a well-defined\nsoftware interface.\n\nConsidering the above, UEFI firmware makes for a perfect mechanism of persistent malware\nstorage. A sophisticated attacker can modify the firmware in order to have it deploy malicious\ncode that will be run after the operating system is loaded. Moreover, since it is typically\nshipped within SPI flash storage that is soldered to the computer’s motherboard, such\nimplanted malware will be resistant to OS reinstallation or replacement of the hard drive.\n\nThis type of attack has occurred in several instances in the past few years. A prominent\n[example is the LowJax implant discovered by our friends at ESET in 2018, in which patched](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/09/27/lojax-first-uefi-rootkit-found-wild-courtesy-sednit-group/)\nUEFI modules of the LoJack anti-theft software (also known as Computrace) were used to\n\n\n-----\n\ndeploy a malicious user mode agent in a number of Sofacy \\ Fancy Bear victim machines.\n[The dangers of Computrace itself were described by our colleagues from the Global](https://securelist.com/absolute-computrace-revisited/58278/)\nResearch and Analysis Team (GReAT) back in 2014.\n\nAnother example is source code of a UEFI bootkit named VectorEDK which was discovered\nin the Hacking Team leaks from 2015. This code consisted of a set of UEFI modules that\ncould be incorporated into the platform firmware in order to have it deploy a backdoor to the\nsystem which will be run when the OS loads, or redeploy it if it was wiped. Despite the fact\n[that VectorEDK’s code was made public and can be found in Github nowadays, we hadn’t](https://github.com/hackedteam/vector-edk)\nwitnessed actual evidence of it in the wild, before our latest finding.\n\n## Our Discovery\n\nDuring an investigation, we came across several suspicious UEFI firmware images. A\ndeeper inspection revealed that they contained four components that had an unusual\nproximity in their assigned GUID values, those were two DXE drivers and two UEFI\napplications. After further analysis we were able to determine that they were based on the\nleaked source code of HackingTeam’s VectorEDK bootkit, with minor customizations.\n\n**_Rogue components found within the compromised UEFI firmware_**\n\nThe goal of these added modules is to invoke a chain of events that would result in writing a\nmalicious executable named ‘IntelUpdate.exe’ to the victim’s Startup folder. Thus, when\nWindows is started the written malware would be invoked as well. Apart from that, the\nmodules would ensure that if the malware file is removed from the disk, it will be rewritten.\nSince this logic is executed from the SPI flash, there is no way to avoid this process other\nthan eliminating the malicious firmware.\n\nFollowing is an outline of the components that we revealed:\n\n\n-----\n\n**SmmInterfaceBase: a DXE driver that is based on Hacking Team s rkloader**\ncomponent and intended to deploy further components of the bootkit for later\nexecution. This is done by registering a callback that will be invoked upon an event of\ntype EFI_EVENT_GROUP_READY_TO_BOOT. The event occurs at a point when\ncontrol can be passed to the operating system’s bootloader, effectively allowing the\ncallback to take effect before it. The callback will in turn load and invoke the\n‘SmmAccessSub’ component.\n**Ntfs: a driver written by Hacking Team that is used to detect and parse the NTFS file**\nsystem in order to allow conducting file and directory operations on the disk.\n**SmmReset: a UEFI application intended to mark the firmware image as infected. This**\nis done by setting the value of a variable named ‘fTA’ to a hard-coded GUID. The\napplication is based on a component from the original Vector-EDK code base that is\nnamed ‘ReSetfTA’.\n\n**_Setting of the fTA variable with a predefined GUID to mark the execution of the bootkit_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SmmAccessSub: the main bootkit component that serves as a persistent dropper for**\na user-mode malware. It is executed by the callback registered during the execution of\n‘SmmInterfaceBase’, and takes care of writing a binary embedded within it as a file\nnamed ‘IntelUpdate.exe’ to the startup directory on disk. This allows the binary to\nexecute when Windows is up and running.\nThis is the only proprietary component amongst the ones we inspected, which was\nmostly written from scratch and makes only slight use of code from a Vector-EDK\napplication named ‘fsbg’. It conducts the following actions to drop the intended file to\ndisk:\n\nBootstraps pointers for the SystemTable, BootServices and RuntimeServices\nglobal structures.\nTries to get a handle to the currently loaded image by invoking the\nHandleProtocol method with the EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL_GUID\nargument.\nIf the handle to the current image is obtained, the module attempts to find the root\ndrive in which Windows is installed by enumerating all drives and checking that\nthe ‘\\Windows\\System32’ directory exists on them. A global\nEFI_FILE_PROTOCOL object that corresponds to the drive will be created at this\npoint and referenced to open any further directories or files in this drive.\nIf the root drive is found in the previous stage, the module looks for a marker file\nnamed ‘setupinf.log’ under the Windows directory and proceeds only if it doesn’t\nexist. In the absence of this file, it is created.\nIf the creation of ‘setupinf.log’ succeeds, the module goes on to check if the\n‘Users’ directory exists under the same drive.\nIf the ‘Users’ directory exists, it writes the ‘IntelUpdate.exe’ file (embedded in the\nUEFI application’s binary) under the ‘ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start\nMenu\\Programs\\Startup’ directory in the root drive.\n\n**_Code from ‘SmmAccessSub’ used to write the embedded ‘IntelUpdate.exe’ binary to_**\n**_the Windows Startup directory_**\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, we were not able to determine the exact infection vector that allowed the\nattackers to overwrite the original UEFI firmware. Our detection logs show that the firmware\nitself was found to be malicious, but no suspicious events preceded it. Due to this, we can\nonly speculate how the infection could have happened.\n\nOne option is through physical access to the victim’s machine. This could be partially based\non Hacking Team’s leaked material, according to which the installation of firmware infected\nwith VectorEDK requires booting the target machine from a USB key. Such a USB would\ncontain a special update utility that can be generated with a designated builder provided by\nthe company. We found a Q-flash update utility in our inspected firmware, which could have\nbeen used for such a purpose as well.\n\nFurthermore, the leaks reveal that the UEFI infection capability (which is referred to by\nHacking Team as ‘persistent installation’) was tested on ASUS X550C laptops. These make\nuse of UEFI firmware by AMI which is very similar to the one we inspected. For this reason\nwe can assume that Hacking Team’s method of patching the firmware would work in our\ncase as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Excerpt from a Hacking Team manual for deployment of infected UEFI firmware, also_**\n**_known as ‘persistent installation’_**\n\nOf course, we cannot exclude other possibilities whereby rogue firmware was pushed\nremotely, perhaps through a compromised update mechanism. Such a scenario would\ntypically require exploiting vulnerabilities in the BIOS update authentication process. While\nthis could be the case, we don’t have any evidence to support it.\n\n## The Bigger Picture: Enter MosaicRegressor Framework\n\nWhile Hacking Team’s original bootkit was used to write one of the company’s backdoors to\ndisk, known as ‘Soldier’, ‘Scout’ or ‘Elite’, the UEFI implant we investigated deployed a new\npiece of malware that we haven’t seen thus far. We decided to look for similar samples that\nshare strings and implementation traits with the dropped binary. Consequently, the samples\nthat we found suggested that the dropped malware was only one variant derived from a\nwider framework that we named MosaicRegressor.\n\nMosaicRegressor is a multi-stage and modular framework aimed at espionage and data\ngathering. It consists of downloaders, and occasionally multiple intermediate loaders, that\nare intended to fetch and execute payload on victim machines. The fact that the framework\nconsists of multiple modules assists the attackers to conceal the wider framework from\nanalysis, and deploy components to target machines only on demand. Indeed, we were able\nto obtain only a handful of payload components during our investigation.\n\nThe downloader components of MosaicRegressor are composed of common business logic,\nwhereby the implants contact a C&C, download further DLLs from it and then load and\ninvoke specific export functions from them. The execution of the downloaded modules\nusually results in output that can be in turn issued back to the C&C.\n\nHaving said that, the various downloaders we observed made use of different\ncommunication mechanisms when contacting their C&Cs:\n\nCURL library (HTTP/HTTPS)\nBITS transfer interface\nWinHTTP API\nPOP3S/SMTPS/IMAPS, payloads transferred in e-mail messages\n\nThe last variant in the list is distinct for its use of e-mail boxes to host the requested payload.\nThe payload intended to run by this implant can also generate an output upon invocation,\nwhich can be later forwarded to a ‘feedback’ mail address, where it will likely be collected by\nthe attackers.\n\nThe mail boxes used for this purpose reside on the ‘mail.ru’ domain, and are accessed using\ncredentials that are hard-coded in the malware’s binary. To fetch the requested file from the\ntarget inbox MailReg enters an infinite loop where it tries to connect to the “pop mail ru”\n\n\n-----\n\nserver every 20 minutes, and makes use of the first pair of credentials that allow a successful\nconnection. The e-mails used for login (without their passwords) and corresponding\nfeedback mail are specified in the table below:\n\n**Login mail** **Feedback mail**\n\nthtgoolnc@mail.ru thgetmmun@mail.ru\n\nthbububugyhb85@mail.ru thyhujubnmtt67@mail.ru\n\nThe downloaders can also be split in two distinct types, the “plain” one just fetching the\npayload, and the “extended” version that also collects system information:\n\n**_Structure of the log file written by BitsRegEx, strings marked in red are the original_**\n**_fields that appear in that file_**\n\nWe were able to obtain only one variant of the subsequent stage, that installs in the autorun\nregistry values and acts as another loader for the components that are supposed to be\nfetched by the initial downloader. These components are also just intermediate loaders for\nthe next stage DLLs. Ultimately, there is no concrete business logic in the persistent\ncomponents, as it is provided by the C&C server in a form of DLL files, most of them\ntemporary.\n\nWe have observed one such library, “load.rem“, that is a basic document stealer, fetching\nfiles from the “Recent Documents” directory and archiving them with a password, likely as a\npreliminary step before exfiltrating the result to the C&C by another component.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following figure describes the full flow and connection between the components that we\nknow about. The colored elements are the components that we obtained and gray ones are\nthe ones we didn’t:\n\n**_Flow from BitsRegEx to execution of intermediate loaders and final payload_**\n\n## Who were the Targets?\n\nAccording to our telemetry, there were several dozen victims who received components from\nthe MosaicRegressor framework between 2017 and 2019. These victims included diplomatic\nentities and NGOs in Africa, Asia and Europe. Only two of them were also infected with the\nUEFI bootkit in 2019, predating the deployment of the BitsReg component.\n\nBased on the affiliation of the discovered victims, we could determine that all had some\nconnection to the DPRK, be it non-profit activity related to the country or actual presence\nwithin it. This common theme can be reinforced through one of the infection vectors used to\ndeliver the malware to some of the victims, which was SFX archives pretending to be\ndocuments discussing various subjects related to North Korea. Those were bundled with\nboth an actual document and MosaicRegressor variants, having both executed when the\narchive is opened. Examples for the lure documents can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Examples of lure documents bundled to malicious SFX archives sent to_**\n**_MosaicRegressor victims, discussing DPRK related topics_**\n\n## Who is behind the attack?\n\nWhen analyzing MosaicRegressor’s variants, we noticed several interesting artefacts that\nprovided us with clues on the identity of the actor behind the framework. As far as we can\ntell, the attacks were conducted by a Chinese-speaking actor, who may have previously used\nthe Winnti backdoor. We found the following evidence to support this:\n\nWe spotted many strings used in the system information log generated by the\nBitsRegEx variant that contain the character sequence ‘0xA3, 0xBA’. This is an invalid\nsequence for a UTF8 string and the LATIN1 encoding translates these symbols to a\npound sign followed by a “masculine ordinal indicator” (“£º”). An attempt to iterate over\nall available iconv symbol tables, trying to convert the sequence to UTF-8, produces\npossible candidates that give a more meaningful interpretation. Given the context of the\nstring preceding the symbol and line feed symbols following it, the best match is the\n“FULL-WIDTH COLON” Unicode character translated from either the Chinese or\nKorean code pages (i.e. CP936 and CP949).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure: The BitsRegEx system information log making use of the character sequence 0xA3,\n0xBA, likely used to represent a full-width colon, according to code pages CP936 and\nCP949.\n\nAnother artefact that we found was a file resource found in CurlReg samples that\ncontained a language identifier set to 2052 (“zh-CN”)\n\n**_Chinese language artefact in the resource section of a CurlReg sample_**\n\nWe detected an OLE2 object taken out of a document armed with the CVE-2018-0802\nvulnerability, which was produced by the so-called ‘Royal Road’ / ‘8.t’ document builder\nand used to drop a CurlReg variant. To the best of our knowledge, this builder is\ncommonly used by Chinese-speaking threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Excerpt from the OLE2 object found within a ‘Royal Road’ weaponized document,_**\n**_delivering the CurlReg variant_**\n\nA C&C address (103.82.52[.]18) which was found in one of MosaicRegressor’s variants\n(MD5:3B58E122D9E17121416B146DAAB4DB9D) was observed in use by the ‘Winnti\n[umbrella and linked groups’, according to a publicly available report. Since this is the](https://401trg.com/burning-umbrella/)\nonly link between our findings and any of the groups using the Winnti backdoor, we\nestimate with low confidence that it is indeed responsible for the attacks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe attacks described in this blog post demonstrate the length an actor can go in order to\ngain the highest level of persistence on a victim machine. It is highly uncommon to see\ncompromised UEFI firmware in the wild, usually due to the low visibility into attacks on\nfirmware, the advanced measures required to deploy it on a target’s SPI flash chip, and the\nhigh stakes of burning sensitive toolset or assets when doing so.\n\nWith this in mind, we see that UEFI continues to be a point of interest to APT actors, while at\nlarge being overlooked by security vendors. The combination of our technology and\nunderstanding of the current and past campaigns leveraging infected firmware, helps us\nmonitor and report on future attacks against such targets.\n\nThe full details of this research, as well as future updates on the underlying threat actor, are\navailable to customers of the APT reporting service through our Threat Intelligence Portal.\n\n## IoCs\n\nThe followings IoC list is not complete.
