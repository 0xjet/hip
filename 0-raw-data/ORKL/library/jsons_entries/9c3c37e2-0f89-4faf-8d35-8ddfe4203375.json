The group behind these\n\nattacks is known as Dragon�y. The group has been in operation since at least 2011 but has re-emerged over the past two years from a quiet period following exposure by Symantec\n\n(https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dragon�y-western-energy-companies-under-sabotage-threat-energetic-bear) and a number of other researchers in 2014. This “Dragon�y 2.0” campaign, which\n\nappears to have begun in late 2015, shares tactics and tools used in earlier campaigns by the group.\n\nThe energy sector has become an area of increased interest to cyber attackers over the past two years. Most notably, disruptions to Ukraine’s power system (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber\nattack-energy-idUSKBN1521BA) in 2015 and 2016 were attributed to a cyber attack and led to power outages a�ecting hundreds of thousands of people. In recent months, there have also been media reports of\n\n[attempted attacks on the electricity grids (http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/statesponsored-hackers-targeted-eirgrid-electricity-network-in-devious-attack-36005921.html) in some European countries, as](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/statesponsored-hackers-targeted-eirgrid-electricity-network-in-devious-attack-36005921.html)\n\n[well as reports of companies that manage nuclear facilities in the U.S. being compromised (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/technology/nuclear-plant-hack-report.html) by hackers.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/technology/nuclear-plant-hack-report.html)\n\nThe Dragon�y group appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the\n\nability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so. Symantec customers are protected against the activities of the Dragon�y group.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. An outline of the Dragon�y group's activities in its most recent campaign\n\n#### Dragon�y 2.0\n\nSymantec has evidence indicating that the Dragon�y 2.0 campaign has been underway since at least December 2015 and has identi�ed a distinct increase in activity in 2017.\n\nSymantec has strong indications of attacker activity in organizations in the U.S., Turkey, and Switzerland, with traces of activity in organizations outside of these countries. The U.S. and Turkey were also among\n\nh i d b D �i i li i h h h f i i i T k d h i d d i ll i hi i\n\n\n-----\n\nThe earliest activity identi�ed by Symantec in this renewed campaign was a malicious email campaign that sent emails disguised as an invitation to a New Year’s Eve party to targets in the energy sector in\n\nDecember 2015.\n\nThe group conducted further targeted malicious email campaigns during 2016 and into 2017. The emails contained very speci�c content related to the energy sector, as well as some related to general business\n\nconcerns. Once opened, the attached malicious document would attempt to leak victims’ network credentials to a server outside of the targeted organization.\n\n[In July, Cisco blogged about email-based attacks targeting the energy sector using a toolkit called Phishery. (http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/template-injection.html) Some of the emails sent in 2017](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/template-injection.html)\n\n[that were observed by Symantec were also using the Phishery toolkit (Trojan.Phisherly (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071414-3257-99)), to steal victims’ credentials via a](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071414-3257-99)\n\ntemplate injection attack. This toolkit became generally available on GitHub in late 2016,\n\nAs well as sending malicious emails, the attackers also used watering hole attacks to harvest network credentials, by compromising websites that were likely to be visited by those involved in the energy sector.\n\nThe stolen credentials were then used in follow-up attacks against the target organizations. In one instance, after a victim visited one of the compromised servers, Backdoor.Goodor\n\n(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071207-0015-99) was installed on their machine via PowerShell 11 days later. Backdoor.Goodor provides the attackers with remote\n\naccess to the victim’s machine.\n\n[In 2014 (tel:2014), Symantec observed the Dragon�y group compromise legitimate software in order to deliver malware to victims, a practice also employed in the earlier 2011 campaigns. In the 2016 and 2017](tel:2014)\n\ncampaigns the group is using the evasion framework Shellter in order to develop Trojanized applications. In particular, Backdoor.Dorshel (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017\n071206-3422-99) was delivered as a trojanized version of standard Windows applications.\n\nSymantec also has evidence to suggest that �les masquerading as Flash updates may be used to install malicious backdoors onto target networks—perhaps by using social engineering to convince a victim they\n\nneeded to download an update for their Flash player. Shortly after visiting speci�c URLs, a �le named “install_�ash_player.exe” was seen on victim computers, followed shortly by the Trojan.Karagany.B\n\n(https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073103-3836-99) backdoor.\n\nTypically, the attackers will install one or two backdoors onto victim computers to give them remote access and allow them to install additional tools if necessary. Goodor, Karagany.B, and Dorshel are examples\n\n[of backdoors used, along with Trojan.Heriplor (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073113-4148-99).](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073113-4148-99)\n\n\n##### Western energy sector at risk from ongoing cyber attacks, with potential for sabotage #dragon�y\n\n **CLICK TO TWEET (HTTPS://TWITTER.COM/INTENT/TWEET?**\n\n\n**[TEXT=WESTERN+ENERGY+SECTOR+AT+RISK+FROM+ONGOING+CYBER+ATTACKS%2C+WITH+POTENTIAL+FOR+SABOTAGE+%23DRAGONFLY&SOURCE=THREATINTEL&URL=HTTP%3A%2F%2FWWW.SYMANTEC.COM%2FC](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Western+energy+sector+at+risk+from+ongoing+cyber+attacks%2C+with+potential+for+sabotage+%23dragonfly&source=threatintel&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.symantec.com%2Fconnect%2Fblogs%2Fdragonfly-western-energy-sector-targeted-sophisticated-attack-group&via=threatintel&related=symantec)**\n\n\n**WESTERN-ENERGY-SECTOR-TARGETED-SOPHISTICATED-ATTACK-GROUP&VIA=THREATINTEL&RELATED=SYMANTEC)**\n\n\n#### Strong links with earlier campaigns\n\nThere are a number of indicators linking recent activity with earlier Dragon�y campaigns. In particular, the Heriplor and Karagany Trojans used in Dragon�y 2.0 were both also used in the earlier Dragon�y\n\ncampaigns between 2011 and 2014.\n\nTrojan.Heriplor is a backdoor that appears to be exclusively used by Dragon�y, and is one of the strongest indications that the group that targeted the western energy sector between 2011 and 2014 is the same\n\ngroup that is behind the more recent attacks. This custom malware is not available on the black market, and has not been observed being used by any other known attack groups. It has only ever been seen\n\nbeing used in attacks against targets in the energy sector.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Feature** **Dragon�y (2013-2014)** **Dragon�y 2.0 (2015-2017)** **Link strength**\n\nBackdoor.Oldrea Yes No None\n\nTrojan.Heriplor (Oldrea stage II) Yes Yes Strong\n\nTrojan.Karagany Yes Yes (Trojan.Karagany.B) Medium-Strong\n\nTrojan.Listrix (Karagany stage II) Yes Yes Medium-Strong\n\n“Western” energy sector targeted Yes Yes Medium\n\nStrategic website compromises Yes Yes Weak\n\nPhishing emails Yes Yes Weak\n\nTrojanized applications Yes Yes Weak\n\n\nFigure 2. Links between current and earlier Dragon�y cyber attack campaigns\n\n#### Potential for sabotage\n\nSabotage attacks are typically preceded by an intelligence-gathering phase where attackers collect information about target networks and systems and acquire credentials that will be used in later campaigns.\n\nThe most notable examples of this are Stuxnet and Shamoon, where previously stolen credentials were subsequently used to administer their destructive payloads.\n\nThe original Dragon�y campaigns now appear to have been a more exploratory phase where the attackers were simply trying to gain access to the networks of targeted organizations. The Dragon�y 2.0\n\ncampaigns show how the attackers may be entering into a new phase, with recent campaigns potentially providing them with access to operational systems, access that could be used for more disruptive\n\npurposes in future.\n\nThe most concerning evidence of this is in their use of screen captures. In one particular instance the attackers used a clear format for naming the screen capture �les, [machine description and location].\n\n[organization name]. The string “cntrl” (control) is used in many of the machine descriptions, possibly indicating that these machines have access to operational systems.\n\n\n##### Numerous organizations breached in six-year campaign against the energy sector #dragon�y\n\n\n-----\n\n**SECTOR-TARGETED-SOPHISTICATED-ATTACK-GROUP&VIA=THREATINTEL&RELATED=SYMANTEC)**\n\n\n#### Clues or false �ags?\n\nWhile Symantec cannot de�nitively determine Dragon�y’s origins, this is clearly an accomplished attack group. It is capable of compromising targeted organizations through a variety of methods; can steal\n\ncredentials to traverse targeted networks; and has a range of malware tools available to it, some of which appear to have been custom developed. Dragon�y is a highly focused group, carrying out targeted\n\nattacks on energy sector targets since at least 2011, with a renewed ramping up of activity observed in the last year.\n\nSome of the group’s activity appears to be aimed at making it more di�cult to determine who precisely is behind it:\n\nThe attackers used more generally available malware and “living o� the land” tools, such as administration tools like PowerShell, PsExec, and Bitsadmin, which may be part of a strategy to make attribution\n\nmore di�cult. The Phishery toolkit became available on Github in 2016, and a tool used by the group—Screenutil—also appears to use some code from CodeProject.\n\nThe attackers also did not use any zero days. As with the group’s use of publicly available tools, this could be an attempt to deliberately thwart attribution, or it could indicate a lack of resources.\n\nSome code strings in the malware were in Russian. However, some were also in French, which indicates that one of these languages may be a false �ag.\n\nCon�icting evidence and what appear to be attempts at misattribution make it di�cult to de�nitively state where this attack group is based or who is behind it.\n\nWhat is clear is that Dragon�y is a highly experienced threat actor, capable of compromising numerous organizations, stealing information, and gaining access to key systems. What it plans to do with all this\n\nintelligence has yet to become clear, but its capabilities do extend to materially disrupting targeted organizations should it choose to do so.\n\n#### Protection\n\nSymantec customers are protected against Dragon�y activity, Symantec has also made e�orts to notify identi�ed targets of recent Dragon�y activity.\n\nSymantec has the following speci�c detections in place for the threats called out in this blog:\n\n[Trojan.Phisherly (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071414-3257-99)](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071414-3257-99)\n\n[Backdoor.Goodor (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071207-0015-99)](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071207-0015-99)\n\n[Trojan.Karagany.B (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073103-3836-99)](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073103-3836-99)\n\n[Backdoor.Dorshel (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071206-3422-99)](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071206-3422-99)\n\n[Trojan.Heriplor (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073113-4148-99)](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-073113-4148-99)\n\n[Trojan.Listrix (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071015-2431-99)](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-071015-2431-99)\n\n[Trojan.Karagany (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-121515-0725-99)](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-121515-0725-99)\n\nSymantec has also developed a list of Indicators of Compromise to assist in identifying Dragon�y activity:\n\n\n**Family** **MD5** **Command & Control**\n\nBackdoor.Dorshel b3b5d67f5bbf5a043f5bf5d079dbcb56 hxxp://103.41.177.69/A56WY\n\nTrojan.Karagany.B 1560f68403c5a41e96b28d3f882de7f1 hxxp://37.1.202.26/getimage/622622.jpg\n\n\n-----\n\nTrojan.Listrix da9d8c78efe0c6c8be70e6b857400fb1\n\nHacktool.Credrix a4cf567f27f3b2f8b73ae15e2e487f00\n\nBackdoor.Goodor 765fcd7588b1d94008975c4627c8feb6\n\nTrojan.Phisherly 141e78d16456a072c9697454fc6d5f58 184.154.150.66\n\nScreenutil db07e1740152e09610ea826655d27e8d\n\n\nCustomers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have previously received reporting on the Dragon�y 2.0 group, which included methods of detecting and\n\nthwarting the activities of this adversary.\n\n#### Best Practices\n\nDragon�y relies heavily on stolen credentials to compromise a network. Important passwords, such as those with high privileges, should be at least 8-10 characters long (and preferably longer) and include\n\na mixture of letters and numbers. Encourage users to avoid reusing the same passwords on multiple websites and sharing passwords with others should be forbidden. Delete unused credentials and\n\n[pro�les and limit the number of administrative-level pro�les created. Employ two-factor authentication (such as Symantec VIP (https://vip.symantec.com/)) to provide an additional layer of security,](https://vip.symantec.com/)\n\npreventing any stolen credentials from being used by attackers.\n\nEmphasize multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard against single point failures in any speci�c technology or protection method. This should include the deployment of\n\nregularly updated �rewalls as well as gateway antivirus, intrusion detection or protection systems (IPS), website vulnerability with malware protection, and web security gateway solutions throughout the\n\nnetwork.\n\nImplement and enforce a security policy whereby any sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Ensure that customer data is encrypted as well. This can help mitigate the damage of potential data\n\nleaks from within an organization.\n\nImplement SMB egress tra�c �ltering on perimeter devices to prevent SMB tra�c leaving your network onto the internet.\n\nEducate employees on the dangers posed by spear-phishing emails, including exercising caution around emails from unfamiliar sources and opening attachments that haven’t been solicited. A full\n\n[protection stack helps to defend against emailed threats, including Symantec Email Security.cloud (https://www.symantec.com/products/email-security-cloud), which can block email-borne threats, and](https://www.symantec.com/products/email-security-cloud)\n\n[Symantec Endpoint Protection (https://www.symantec.com/products/endpoint-protection), which can block malware on the endpoint. Symantec Messaging Gateway’s](https://www.symantec.com/products/endpoint-protection)\n\n(https://www.symantec.com/products/messaging-gateway) Disarm technology can also protect computers from threats by removing malicious content from attached documents before they even reach\n\nthe user.\n\nUnderstanding the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of adversaries through services like DeepSight Adversary Intelligence (https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight\nintelligence/adversary) fuels e�ective defense from advanced adversaries like Dragon�y 2.0. Beyond technical understanding of the group, strategic intelligence that informs the motivation, capability, and\n\nlikely next moves of the adversaries ensures more timely and e�ective decisions in proactively safeguarding your environment from these threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n(/connect/user/symantec-security-response)\n\n**[Symantec Security Response
