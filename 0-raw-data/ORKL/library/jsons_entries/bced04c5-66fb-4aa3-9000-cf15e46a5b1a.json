Dubbed Operation SMN, this cross-](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/hidden_lynx.pdf)\nindustry collaboration has seen major security vendors share intelligence and resources,\nresulting in the creation of comprehensive, multi-vendor protection which may significantly\nblunt the effectiveness of this malware. The organizations involved in this operation include\nCisco, FireEye, F-Secure, iSIGHT Partners, Microsoft, Symantec, ThreatConnect, Tenable,\nThreatTrack Security, Novetta, and Volexity.\n\nThe Hikit back door has been used in cyberespionage attacks against a range of targets in\nthe US, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and other regions. Attackers using Hikit have focused\ntheir energies against organizations associated with the government, technology, research,\ndefense, and aerospace sectors among other targets.\n\nOperation SMN is the first time a cross-industry group has come together to disrupt an\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) group. Previous collaborations, such as operations\n[against the gangs behind the Gameover Zeus and](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=5a0ee571-2b14-4e02-8ff7-2c32e9227669&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments) [Shylock Trojans, have usually been](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=f71737b0-3eb4-4ac0-b473-5bcb35695aa9&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nfocused on cybercriminal gangs.\n\n[Coordinated by security firm Novetta under Microsoft’s](http://www.novetta.com/operationsmn) new Coordinated Malware\nEradication program, Operation SMN has resulted in a significant amount of intelligence\nbeing shared among vendors, leading to the rollout of more effective protection against Hikit\nand a number of other associated pieces of malware, including one previously unknown\nmalware tool.\n\n**Hikit**\n\nThe main target for this operation was Backdoor.Hikit, a sophisticated and stealthy remote\naccess Trojan (RAT) which has been used in high profile attacks since 2011. Hikit provides\nthe attackers with a back door on the victim’s computer. It enables them to download\ninformation from the infected computer and upload commands and other malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork-tunneling capabilities allow the threat to create proxies, while an ad-hoc network\ngeneration feature allows it to connect multiple compromised computers to create a\nsecondary network. Hikit comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions, which are deployed\ndepending on the target’s infrastructure.\n\nHikit has been used by at least two Chinese-based APT groups to launch cyberespionage\nattacks: [Hidden Lynx and Pupa (also known as Deep Panda). Whether the groups are](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=8962de07-8e6a-41cc-a6d6-d22ea52dcbfa&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nrelated in some way or whether they simply have access to the same malware tools is\ncurrently unknown.\n\n_Figure 1. Hikit infections by region_\n\n**Hidden Lynx**\nHidden Lynx, also known in the industry as Aurora, is a highly capable and well-resourced\ngroup of attackers that is based in China. The group has a track record of mounting\nrelentless and persistent attacks against a broad range of targets.\n\n[Symantec has carried out extensive research on Hidden Lynx and has concluded that the](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/hidden_lynx.pdf)\ngroup has between 50 and 100 operatives at its disposal and is capable of carrying out\nhundreds of simultaneous attacks against diverse targets. Given its broad focus, the group\nappears to operate as a “hackers for hire”-type operation, mounting attacks on demand as\ndirected by its paymasters.\n\n\n-----\n\nHidden Lynx is regarded as one of the pioneers of the watering-hole attack method and it\nappears to have early access to zero-day vulnerabilities. If it cannot mount direct attacks\nagainst a target, Hidden Lynx has the capabilities and the patience to work its way up\nthrough the supply chain, compromising the security at companies that are suppliers to the\ntarget organization and using them a stepping stone towards the ultimate goal.\n\nHidden Lynx used Hikit during its compromise of Bit9’s trusted file-signing infrastructure in\n2012. This attack was then leveraged to mount the VOHO campaign in July 2012 using\nBit9-signed malware. The ultimate target of this campaign was US companies whose\ncomputers were protected by Bit9. Hikit once again played a key role in this attack\ncampaign.\n\nSince then, Hidden Lynx has continued to use Hikit in its attacks against organizations\npredominantly in Taiwan, the US, Japan, and South Korea. In 2013, Hidden Lynx underwent\n[a significant re-tooling effort, introducing two new malware tools, Backdoor.Fexel and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-092314-4620-99)\n[Backdoor.Gresim, which it continues to use in conjunction with Hikit. Backdoor.Gresim was](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-101409-5111-99)\nundiscovered prior to this collaboration effort.\n\nThis is the first time that a significant effort to disrupt the activities of an APT has been\nmade. Symantec welcomes the work between industry partners to share intelligence and\ncoordinate efforts to provide the maximum impact against APT groups. Through effective\ncollaboration, we can help ensure that any organization likely to be targeted by these\ngroups will be better protected in the future.\n\n**Symantec protection**\nSymantec has the following detections in place for the malware used in these attacks:\n\n**AV**\n\n**IPS**\n\n\n-----",
