It is spreading at a very fast rate and the\nvolumes are high.\"\n\nInternet service provider AOL (part of the AOL Time Warner group which includes CNN) says\nit scanned 40.5 million e-mails and found the virus in more than half. SoBig accounted for 98\npercent of all viruses found.\n\nThe e-mail-borne worm arrives with various subject headers, such as: Your details, Thank\nyou!, Re: Thank you!, Re: Details, Re: Re: My details, Re: Approved, Re: Your application,\nRe: Wicked screensaver or Re: That movie.\n\nThe body of the message is short and usually contains either \"See the attached file for\ndetails\" or \"Please see the attached file for details.\"\n\nFooled that the e-mail is legitimate, the user opens the e-mail and triggers the worm, which\nthen goes hunting for addresses. The flood of messages it then sends are capable of\nsuccumbing other users' inboxes or computer systems by the sheer volume of e-mails.\n\n## Worrying sign\n\nThe virus also implements a background program that turns an infected computer into a\nrelay system for further messages from the virus' creator.\n\nThis part of the virus has led many computer security experts to believe the virus was written\nto try and beat spam filters.\n\nExperts are predicting that though it will soon be brought under control, the infection is likely\nto spike early next week as many people in Europe and the U.S. return to work from\n(northern hemisphere) summer holidays to awaiting e-mail inboxes.\n\nHowever, the worm is set to deactivate September 10 and halt further propagation. This itself\nis a worrying sign.\n\n\"The SoBig virus writer's use of an inbuilt expiry date indicates he is committed to inventing\nnew and improved versions,\" MessageLabs' chief technology officer Mark Sunner said.\n\n\"Each variant released so far has exceeded the previous one in growth and impact during\nthe critical initial window of vulnerability.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n_-- CNN Correspondent Bill Tucker contributed to this report._\n\nStory Tools\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial\nIssues of Time!\n\n\n[Burgers, lattes and CD burners](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/TECH/06/17/mcdonalds.flagship.ap/index.html)\n\n- CNN/Money: Britney Spears No. 1 name used\nby hackers\n\n- CNN/Money: [Atari's future in question](http://edition.cnn.com/money/2005/06/16/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm)\n\n- CNN/Money: Report: Cingular opposes calls\non planes\n\n\nEU 'crisis' after summit\nfailure\n\n- [Iran poll to go to run-off](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/06/18/iran.ballot/index.html)\n\n- [40 million credit cards exposed](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/BUSINESS/06/18/us.credit.ap/index.html)\n\n- U.S. House votes to keep U.N.\ndues\n\n\n-----",
