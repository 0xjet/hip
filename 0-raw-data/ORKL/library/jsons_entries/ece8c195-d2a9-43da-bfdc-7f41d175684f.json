However, as we later discovered, this was a\nmalicious campaign designed to install malware that provides remote access to our\ndevices.\n\nLast week, BleepingComputer received an email to our contact form from an IP address\nbelonging to a United Kingdom virtual server company.\n\nThis email pretended to be from a venture capitalist interested in investing or buying\nBleepingComputer, with the whole email listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\nHello, we are a group of venture capitalists investing in promising projects.\nWe saw your website and were astounded by your product. We want to discuss the\nopportunity to invest or buy a part of the share in your project. Please get in touch\nwith us by phone or in Vuxner chat.\nYour agent is Philip Bennett. His username in Vuxner is philipbennett Make sure you\ncontact us ASAP because we are not usually so generous with our offers. Thank you\nin advance!\"\n\nWriting about cybersecurity for so long, I am paranoid regarding email, messaging, and\nvisiting unknown websites. So, I immediately grew suspicious of the email, fired up a virtual\nmachine and VPN, and did a search for Vuxner.\n\nGoogle showed only a few results for 'Vuxner,' with one being for a well-designed and\nlegitimate-looking vuxner[.]com, a site promoting \"Vuxner Chat – Next level of privacy with\nfree instant messaging.\"\n\n**Threat actor's Vuxner[.]com site to deploy malware**\nAs this appeared to be the \"Vuxner chat\" the threat actors referenced in their email,\nBleepingComputer attempted to download it and run it on a virtual machine.\n\n[BleepingComputer found that the VuxnerChat.exe download [VirusTotal] actually installs the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f367e39df6a218f5caaf4228dbea7a09111fbb95de48ec7bbfe31c8b8c8f970b/relations)\n\"Trillian\" messaging app and then downloads further malware onto the computer after\nTrillian finishes installing.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Vuxner download installs Trillian**\nAs this type of campaign [looked similar to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-vpn-site-pushes-cryptbot-and-vidar-info-stealing-trojans/) [other campaigns that have pushed remote](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-windows-pc-cleaner-drops-azorult-info-stealing-trojan/)\naccess and password-stealing trojans in the past, BleepingComputer reached out to\n[cybersecurity firm Cluster25 who has previously helped BleepingComputer diagnose similar](https://cluster25.io/)\nmalware attacks in the past.\n\n## Fake Vuxner chat used to install a RAT\n\n[Cluster25 researchers explain in a report coordinated with BleepingComputer that the](https://cluster25.io/2022/03/03/rurat-used-in-spear-phishing-attacks-against-media-organisations-in-united-states/)\nVuxner[.]com is hosted behind Cloudflare, however they could still determine hosting\nserver's actual address at 86.104.15[.]123.\n\nThe researchers state that the Vuxner Chat program is being used as a decoy for installing\na remote desktop software known as RuRAT, which is used as a remote access trojan.\n\n\"Infection chain for this campaign can be divide in a fist stage phase, where the decoy URL\ndrops and installs a Software called “Trillian” and the second one where the installer drops\na legitimate Remote Desktop Software known as RuRAT used for malicious purposes,\"\nthe Cluster25 researchers explain.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a user installs the Vuxner Trillian client and exits the installer, it will download and\n[execute a Setup.exe executable [VirusTotal] from https://vuxner[.]com/setup.exe](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/963d0d5f86bdb7c95d169cadad792963e184d8c0a204a6eecc2f261c2ee408ca)\n\nWhen done, the victim will be left with a C:\\swrbldin folder filled with a variety of batch files,\nVBS scripts, and other files used to install RuRAT on the device.\n\nStrangely, both Cluster25 and BleepingComputer saw the RAT installation ask us to confirm\nthe installation of the software. This prompt is a sloppy giveaway that something nefarious\nis happening and should cause immediate suspicion when displayed.\n\n**Asking**\n\n**permission to install the RAT**\nCluster25 told BleepingComputer that the threat actors are using this attack to gain initial\naccess to a device and then take control over the host.\n\nOnce they control the host, they can search for credentials and sensitive data or use the\ndevice as a launchpad to spread laterally in a network.\n\nAs you can see, threat actors are willing to create elaborate campaigns consisting of fake\nsites, custom installers, and targeted emails to infect their victims.\n\nFor this reason, all business owners and consumers need to be wary of any unusual emails\nstating that you need to download something to communicate with them.\n\nReceiving emails like the one BleepingComputer received should automatically be seen as\nsuspicious, and recipients should research to determine if a particular software is legitimate\nor not.\n\nSimply searching and seeing a single result related to a particular program is a huge red\nflag indicating that the program should be avoided.\n\nAt this time, BleepingComputer is not aware of any other companies or media outlets\ntargeted by this malicious campaign, indicating that this is a limited spear-phishing\ncampaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New stealthy Nerbian RAT malware spotted in ongoing attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-nerbian-rat-malware-spotted-in-ongoing-attacks/)\n\n[New NetDooka malware spreads via poisoned search results](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-netdooka-malware-spreads-via-poisoned-search-results/)\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Ukraine supporters in Germany targeted with PowerShell RAT malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-supporters-in-germany-targeted-with-powershell-rat-malware/)\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[Investor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/investor/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[RAT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rat/)\n[Remote Access Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/remote-access-trojan/)\n[Spear Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[VC](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vc/)\n[Venture Capitalist](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/venture-capitalist/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
