Gordon Corera investigates this cyber cold\ncase\n\nIn 2009, someone broke into the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia and\nstole emails. The material was distributed online - mainly on blogs linked to climate change\nsceptics. It was used to make the case that scientists were surreptitiously twisting the facts to\nexaggerate climate change. That was not the case. But before that became clear, events\nwould take on a life of their own, sparking a global media storm.\n\nThis is a story that matters - firstly because it may have set back by years efforts to combat\nclimate change. But also because it foretold a future in which emails would be stolen and\nweaponised and where information and social media would be used to cast doubt on science\nand expertise.\n\nMore than a decade on, as the UK hosts a new global climate summit - COP26 in Glasgow the mystery of who was behind ‘Climategate’ remains.\n\n\n-----\n\nBBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera goes on the trail of this cyber cold case,\ntalking to the key players as well as police and spies, taking the listener on a journey to a\nplace where climate change and information warfare met - with world-changing\nconsequences.\nProducer: Sally Abrahams\nEditor: Richard Vadon\n\nCredit: MSNBC News Live 25 November 2009 and NBC Nightly News, 4 December 2009\n\nAvailable now\n\n15 minutes\n\n## Last on\n\nMon 1 Nov 2021 13:45\n\nBBC Radio 4\n\n## More episodes\n\n### Previous\n\nYou are at the first episode\n\n### Next\n\n**[On the Trail](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00114bb)**\n\n[See all episodes from The Hack that Changed the World](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00114bd/episodes)\n\n## Watch More:\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about Professor Phil Jones, the scientist at the heart of the 2009\n‘Climategate’ affair, do watch the BBC One drama, [The Trick, on BBC iPlayer’](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0010s10/the-trick)\n\n## Broadcast\n\nMon 1 Nov 2021 13:45\n\nBBC Radio 4\n\n\n-----\n\n## Was this the hack that changed the world?\n\nWho was behind the 2009 hack and leak of emails that fuelled climate change sceptics?\n\n\n-----",
