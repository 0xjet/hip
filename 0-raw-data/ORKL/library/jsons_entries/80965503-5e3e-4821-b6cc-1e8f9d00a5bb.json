Starting in mid-November, an unknown actor purporting to be from\nthe tax collection arm of the Turkish government began a spear phishing campaign against a\nTurkish defense contractor. The group used tactics that have become extremely useful for\ncyber spies—spear phishing emails that social engineer the victim to download an attached\nor embedded file and then enable macros. These macros contain executable files that\ndownload a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), which can log keystrokes, take screenshots,\nrecord audio and video from a webcam or microphone, and install and uninstall programs\nand manage files.\n\nRiskIQ identified multiple employees within the targeted organization that were affected. The\nfirst email we were alerted to was sent on November 16 at around 6 a.m. The email, which\nwe censored from victim PII, looked like this:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig-1 Example of the spear phishing email\n\n## Analysis - Stage 1 Email Attachment\n\nThe email supposedly comes from the Turkish government entity responsible for taxes. The\nemail states that there is a possible tax exemption in place for the receiver if he/she fills out\nthe attached documents. Although the sender domain, gerlirler.gov.tr, is valid, if we check the\nactual email SPF verification, we can see that it failed:\n\n_Received-SPF: Fail (domain gelirler.gov.tr does not designate 185.85.204.180 as a permitted_\n_sender),_\n\n_client-ip=<185.85.204.180>; identity=<posta2@gelirler.gov.tr>; helo=_\n_<lnx1.hostingfabrika.com>;_\n\nProprietary data within RiskIQ PassiveTotal shows the IP sending the email messages hosts\na law firm website: https://community.riskiq.com/projects/d731e758-cc96-b68e-4286fe8b8f2308f1?guest=true:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig-2 Site for a law firm also hosted on the IP from which the emails came\n\nWhile it could, of course, be a fake website, it’s more likely a compromised host as it also\ncontained phishing pages for the dating website Match.com:\n\nFig-3 A phishing page also hosted on the IP\n\n\n-----\n\nNormal email for the Gelirler domain would come from the IP specified in the MX record of\ngelirler.gov.tr, which is 212.133.164.130. Their SPF records, which enforce this process,\nhave been set to \"v=spf1 mx -all.”\n\nThe attachment is an XLS document with the title “2017-94197 SAYILI GENELGE\n\n[DUYURU].xls.” Opening the document shows a prevalent attack flow: Macros.\n\nFig-4 Malicious attachment encouraging the user to enable macros\n\nThe Turkish text above the image translates to: “Microsoft Office Macro error, enable macros\n_for viewing,” a message that social engineers the user to enable macros._\n\nThe macro contains a slightly obfuscated malicious executable file inside. The executable\ndata is stored inside the macro in the form of arrays with integer values spread throughout\nthe macro script. The data from the arrays is combined and written to disk in the Application\nData folder. The filename chosen seems to be random for every macro—most likely\ngenerated automatically.\n\nFig-5 The arrays as seen in the macro, converting the values shows a stripped PE header.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the XLS shown above, the PE is written to %appdata%rqco.exe and executed. This file is\na small (3kb) loader, which downloads the second stage of the attack. The loader has no\nimports, but at runtime, resolves the UrlDownloadToFile function from the URLMON library to\ndownload stage two, and then ShellExecute from kernel32 to run the downloaded stage two.\nThe stage-two payload downloads from hxxp://unifscon[.]com/R9_Sys.exe.\n\n## Analysis - Stage 2 RAT\n\nStage two of the attack is a packed piece of malware, and the packer used is Visual Basicbased. After the malware unpacks, it carries the unmistakable leftover information pointing to\na RAT known as ‘Remcos’—specifically, it seems, the paid Pro version:\n\nFig-6 Stage two of the attack\n\nRemcos is a tool supposedly sold for ‘remote administration’ purposes, but like many of\nthese services, it’s used in digital attacks often. Current Remcos functionality includes:\n\nFile operations: download, upload, modify, and search for files on infected machines\nScreen reading: automated screenshotting of the infected machine\nRegistry operations: full control of the registry\nInteraction functionality: an operator can open a chat session with the victim\nSteal or modify the clipboard\nExecute (VBS) scripts or executables\nTasks (automate any of the above functionality to run periodically)\nUse infected hosts as SOCKS5 proxies (direct and reverse, allows for tunneling and\nproxying)\n\nMore information on Remcos, additional reference samples, unpacked samples, and write[ups can be found on Malpedia: https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.remcos](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.remcos)\n\nOne interesting piece of functionality is the SOCKS5 proxy capabilities. An operator can turn\nthe victims of the crime into proxies for its own network, hiding the real C2 server. We can\nsee the operator do this in this campaign.\n\n[The C2 server configured for the attack on the defense contractor is civita2.no-ip.biz. RiskIQ](https://community.riskiq.com/search/civita2.no-ip.biz)\n[has also seen civita1.no-ip.biz used in other samples of the same campaign (more on this](https://community.riskiq.com/search/civita1.no-ip.biz)\nlater). While the emails started appearing around mid-November, the operator had a C2\nserver in place already—a rented server at Leaseweb. We can see the server first appear in\n\n\n-----\n\nDNS routing on July 18:\n\nFig-7 Resolution info for the C2 server used in the attack\n\nThen, a little while after sending out the spear phishing emails, we can see the IP resolution\nchange with, most likely, IP addresses of compromised machines used for SOCKS5 proxying\nto hide the C2:\n\nFig-8 IP resolution info for the c2 server changing\n\n[While almost all IP addresses are under AS12978, which is a Turkish broadband IP pool, the](https://bgp.he.net/AS12978)\n[only one other IP address in the list is 176.239.143.116, which comes from a Turkish mobile](https://community.riskiq.com/search/176.239.143.116)\nconnection.\n\nThe odds are that the listed IP addresses belong to victims turned into SOCKS5 proxies or a\nsingle victim with predictably good uptime. The first IP address we noticed was most likely\nthe C2 server at which they started. It’s possible that the actors are still using it, but have\nhidden it behind the SOCKS5 proxies of their victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Analysis - Additional Infrastructure and Malware Samples\n\nOne interesting aspect of this campaign is that the C2 domain formats are clearly numbered\nin civita[0-9]+.no-ip.biz format. We found one more set like the previous one on shared IP\nspace, which follows the komot[0-9]+.punkdns.pw pattern:\n\nFig-9 C2 following the same pattern\n\nThis set of domains also comes back if we investigate the domain used to spread the initial\nRAT from the unifscon.com domain. Here is a list of filepaths and the configured C2:\n\n**unifscon.com filepath** **C2**\n\n/R9_Sys.exe komot1.punkdns.pw:5700\n\n/Favos.exe civita2.no-ip.biz:4042\n\n/NWConn.exe civita1.no-ip.biz:8484\n\n/R9_Sys7.exe komot1.punkdns.pw:7500\n\nSomething to note is that the initial URL from which the stager would download a payload,\nlocated at unifscon.com/R9_sys.exe, changed payloads often during our research. This lead\nto a lot of overlap in the infrastructure of the attack linking the four domains we’ve mentioned\ntogether.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe full set of discovered samples based on the distribution domain and the C2 domains can\nbe found in our RiskIQ Community project listed in the next section. Additionally, for those\nwith VirusTotal Intelligence dashboard access, we suggest close monitoring of the following\nsubmitter ID: 2c5391fa. This Russia-based submitter seems to be a pre-leading cause to a\nlot of samples we see appearing online in VirusTotal—some uploads are WinRAR SFX selfextracting containers or just plain samples.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nThe indicators of the campaign (IOCs) targeting the defense contractor can be found in the\ntable below. Keep in mind that while the IP addresses listed on the network IOC section\naren’t all the IP addresses to which the domain pointed, they are only the IP addresses to\nwhich the host pointed during the campaign described above.\n\nWe would also like to point out that this campaign wasn’t run on its own—far before this\ncampaign, the actors used these domains in other attacks. Pivoting through the related IP\naddresses can give some additional insights into the vast infrastructure of this attacker, which\nseems to be relying on using its victims as the SOCKS5 tunnels’ proxies.\n\nAdditional IOCs based on expanding our search criteria and pivoting on the C2s yielded a\nvery large set, which is available (combined with the IOCs for the defense contractor) in our\nRiskIQ Community Project: https://community.riskiq.com/projects/d731e758-cc96-b68e-4286fe8b8f2308f1?guest=true\n\n**Filesystem IOCs**\n\n**SHA256** **Note**\n\n70b1a96ca6a9cf93a9945bec1f0c2ff793c2f34f5c9aa9f975f5386a6467bb8c Stage 1\nExcel\ndocument\nwith\nmacro\n\nfa606bfc64fb2940a423610ebd41ff79eac67c74059a4120d1583e88550b13b7 Stage 1\nExcel\ndocument\nwith\nmacro\n\n8483e94c60b90898dd9677b080ec664d63c43d0978c0bb871c6f2b04cb6c9a12 Stage 1\nExcel\ndocument\nwith\nmacro\n\n\n-----\n\n9aa8dd5141166ee252ab61d3e518e5730ffe8fd2acfd8cd820f990d20bc468a2 Stage 1\nExcel\ndocument\nwith\nmacro\n\nfa27d7833b743d1960fdd51a5a250f6869835bb7560a4eb9d61f32d590c2ab60 Stage 2\nLoader\n\n07fdd507deff1680361b7106298575d0128983173d3670e5b830d8566190c39a Stage 2\nLoader\n\nac3a2db520592abe8497abf2db14bb3a2468e11768b4585cc1ffc057971aac3d Stage 3\nRAT\n\neb367f22531f2346898c1f9bca69b8f03742bee5aa4fec51f29f5fd9520a446f Stage 3\nRAT\n\n0ca47d69249b42f2a7b2a60e4fbd2058a70b6d43eee549ab5ea31523289da09a Stage 3\nRAT\n\n**Network IOCs**\n\n**Domain** **IP Address**\n\ncivita1.no-ip.biz 178.162.197.211\n\n31.200.14.84\n\n213.183.40.59\n\ncivita2.no-ip.biz 31.200.14.84\n\n31.200.11.249\n\n31.200.17.0\n\n31.200.13.36\n\n176.239.143.116\n\n31.200.12.44\n\nkomot1.punkdns.pw 212.7.208.121\n\n136.0.3.219\n\n213.183.40.59\n\nkomot2.punkdns.pw 213.183.40.59\n\n\n-----\n\nFor a full, continuously updated list of IOCs related to this attack, visit the RiskIQ Community\nPublic Project here: https://community.riskiq.com/projects/d731e758-cc96-b68e-4286fe8b8f2308f1?guest=true\n\n## Subscribe to Our Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the RiskIQ newsletter to stay up-to-date on our latest content, headlines,\nresearch, events, and more.\n\nBase Editor\n\n\n-----",
