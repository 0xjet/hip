    "plain_text": "# Threat Spotlight: Eternity Project MaaS Goes On and On\n\n**[blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/06/threat-spotlight-eternity-project-maas-goes-on-and-on](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/06/threat-spotlight-eternity-project-maas-goes-on-and-on)**\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe Eternity Project sounds like some kind of glitzy new album promoted by a pop star who\nhas a symbol for a name. Instead, it’s a malware toolkit sold as a malware-as-a-service\n(MaaS) opportunity. The cheapest subscription costs less per year than a Netflix\nsubscription. Threat actors running the service distribute it through the anonymous Tor\nmarketplace and Telegram channels as the “Eternity Group.”\n\nThe group markets its product in both English and Russian and appears to have links to the\nRussian “Jester Group,” which has been active since July 2021. The Eternity Stealer, sold\nas a component of Eternity Group’s MaaS platform, appears to be a rebrand of the Jester\nStealer malware, which was seen targeting Ukraine in May 2022.\n\nThe threat actors utilize the Telegram messaging platform to communicate feature updates.\nIn addition, a Telegram bot enables the purchaser to customize the build of the malware\nand choose desired features. The malware is sold as annual subscriptions or perpetual\nlicenses, with prices ranging from US$90 to almost US$500 for separate parts of the toolkit.\n\n### Operating System\n\n\n-----\n\n### Risk and Impact\n\n Eternity Project Malware-as-a-Service Pricing\n\nThe malware toolkit is hosted on the Eternity Projects TOR webpage, where an overview of\neach malware component is presented and listed for sale, as seen in Figure 1. Each\nmalware item in the toolkit is individually priced.\n\nEternity Stealer - $260 annual subscription\nEternity Miner - $90 annual subscription\nEternity Worm - $390\nEternity Ransomware - $490\nEternity Clipper - $110\nEternity DDoS Bot - (Still in development)\n\n_Figure 1 - Eternity TOR webpage displaying a variety of malware for sale_\n\n[Eternity was originally brought to light by a Cyble report that mentioned the group’s](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/05/12/a-closer-look-at-eternity-malware/)\nTelegram channel had over 500 subscribers. This channel has since been banned and a\nnew one has been created, as seen in Figure 2. At the time of writing, the new channel has\n150 subscribers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 - New Telegram channel used for communicating product updates_\n\n\n-----\n\n### How Eternity Ransomware Operates\n\nThe ransomware offered by Eternity is a .NET executable that uses the name\n“Microsoft.exe” to try and lull the user into a false sense of safety. The file contains a lot of\n[similarities to the open-source, proof of concept (PoC) ransomware “Povlsomware;” it even](https://github.com/0xFenrik/Povlsomware)\nincludes the name of this ransomware in its strings. It appears that the developer of Eternity\nransomware is utilizing the source code from the open-source GitHub page of\nPovlsomware, and modifying it to create its own bespoke ransomware.\n\nEternity ransomware achieves persistence on the target machine by modifying the startup\nregistry to launch itself on system startup, as seen in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3 – Eternity modifies Startup registry keys to achieve persistence_\n\nThe malware targets personal files, with a list of 788 different file extensions that it seeks. It\nthen performs AES256 encryption on the files it identifies.\n\nEternity differs from most ransomware we have observed by performing extensionless\nencryption. Typically, ransomware will append a unique extension to encrypted files;\nhowever, in this instance, the original file extension is kept. But because the contents of the\nfiles have been modified, the encrypted files no longer work as intended.\n\nThe malware will avoid encrypting files within the following directories, to decrease the\nchance of making crucial system files inoperable:\n\nAll Users\\\\Microsoft\\\\\nAppData\\\\\nC:\\\\Program Files\n\\\\Eternity\\\\\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\\n$Recycle.Bin\n\\\\source\\\\\nTemporary Internet Files\n\n\n-----\n\nC:\\\\Windows\n\nOnce encryption has been carried out, the malware will attempt to destroy shadow copies\nusing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Removing these backups prevents\nvictims from easily reverting back to their machine’s previous pre-encryption state.\n\n_Figure 4 - Eternity deletes backups to prevent the victim from rolling their computer back to_\n_a pre-encryption state_\n\nPost encryption, the victim is presented with a ransom note which is dropped to the\ndesktop. The note states that their computer’s files have been encrypted with “militarygrade” encryption. It also gives instructions on how the victim can go about decrypting their\nfiles for the cost of $800 in Monero cryptocurrency.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 - Ransom note dropped by Eternity_\n\n### Eternity Stealer Malware Functionality\n\nAs is the case with the other malware offered by Eternity, the Eternity Stealer is a .NET\nexecutable file. The file is highly obfuscated to make analyzing the file more difficult.\n\nThe threat actors allow purchasers of this stealer to utilize a Telegram bot to build the\nmalware to meet their exact specifications. To accomplish this, it prompts them with\nquestions about which features they would like to include in the build.\n\nAs seen in Figure 6, available options include enabling AntiVM (Virtual Machine), enabling\nStartup persistence, choosing the file extension of the build, and enabling AntiRepeat.\nAntiRepeat is used to prevent any repeat infections on the target machines, to avoid\nduplication of exfiltrated data.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 - Telegram bot builder options for stealer_\n\nThe strings that are visible in the samples used in this analysis contain a lot of references to\n[the online sandbox video game “Growtopia.” The malware looks like it is related to an old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growtopia)\nEternity tool (shown in Figure 7) that was initially designed to steal credentials of Growtopia\naccounts. This type of credential-stealing tool is commonly distributed via YouTube videos\n\n\n-----\n\nand online forums, where they advertise this functionality. These accounts can be of great\nmonetary value to attackers, as they often contain in-game items that are sold on\nunderground marketplaces.\n\n_Figure 7 - Old Eternity Growtopia credential stealing builder_\n\nThe latest Eternity stealer appears to have been modified using the code of the old\nGrowtopia stealer, adding the ability to target the following items of victims’ sensitive\npersonal information:\n\nCryptocurrency wallet details\nLogin credentials\nForm data saved to the browser\nCookies\nBrowser history\nCredit card details\nFiles containing sensitive data\nOS and hardware information\nA list of installed programs\nVPN and FTP client data\nGaming software data\nMessaging software data\nPassword management software data\n\nHarvested data is stored in a .TXT file within the %Temp% directory. The malware then\nexfiltrates this information to its command-and-control (C2) server. The exfiltration model is\ncarried out by utilizing a C2 inside the TOR network, as seen in Figure 8. The sample will\n\n\n-----\n\nenable a proxy that will send a POST request containing the encrypted .ZIP file to the C2,\nwhich is hosted on the TOR network.\n\n_Figure 8 - Data exfiltration function by Eternity stealer_\n\n### Eternity Worm Malware\n\nThe Telegram bot builder for Eternity Worm offers the budding cybercriminal customer a\nwide range of customizability when purchasing the malware. As shown in Figure 9, this\nincludes:\n\nA URL where the worm will be located after building\nDirect download URLs for the malware\nA Discord spreader message\nA Telegram spreader message\nThe option to enable AntiVM\nThe option to enable Startup\nThe option to change the output file extension\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 - Telegram bot builder options for Worm_\n\nWhen launched, the worm will create a mutex on the machine, before dropping a copy of\nitself under the name “BQJUWOYRTO.exe” into both the \"%Temp%\\\" and\n\"%AppData%\\Local\\ServiceHub\" directories. The malware will then remove the original\ncopy of itself from wherever it was initially located on the disk. The worm will also create a\nscheduled task to ensure it launches at system start up.\n\nOne of the malicious features of Eternity Worm is that it creates Discord and Telegram\nspam in an attempt to spread itself further.\n\nIn creating the Discord spam shown in Figure 10, the worm retrieves a list of target\nusernames by issuing a GET request to “http://discord[.]com[.]/api/users/@me.” This will\nreturn a JSON file with a list of usernames. The worm then issues a GET request to\n“http://discord[.]com[.]/api/users/@me/channels,” which similarly returns a JSON file with a\nlist of Discord channel IDs.\n\n_Figure 10 - Eternity worm Discord spam function_\n\nThe worm then calls the function “SendMessage,” which is used to make a POST request\nto “http://discord[.]com[.]/api/v9/channels/{0}/messages.” This request is formatted with the\nvictim’s ID, with a message containing the text, “Look at this. Very good stuff. [URL]” with\nthe [URL] portion being replaced by the URL where the worm payload itself is hosted. This\nis an attempt to lure the victim into clicking the malicious link and spreading the worm.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn additional feature of the worm is its ability to infect the Python interpreter. The malware\nenumerates the “%AppData%/Local/Programs/Python” directory, and then (as seen in\nFigure 11) it injects the worm loader into all compiled Python projects on the infected\nmachine.\n\n_Figure 11 - Worm Python interpreter infect function_\n\n### Eternity Clipper Targets Crypto Wallets\n\nThe main aim of the Eternity clipper is to swap any cryptocurrency wallet address used by\nthe victim with that of the threat actors. When building the clipper malware with the\nTelegram bot as shown in Figure 12, the threat operator is prompted to enter their crypto\nwallet addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 - Clipper Telegram bot builder_\n\nThe clipper provides functionality for the following cryptocurrencies (also seen in Figure 13):\n\nBitcoin\nEtherium\nMonero\nLitecoin\nDoge\nDashcoin\nXRP\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 - Cryptocurrencies supported by Eternity clipper_\n\nWhen executed, this malware also performs a mutex check and modifies the scheduled\ntasks to ensure it is launched at startup. The malware uses the function\n“AddClipboardFormatListener” to monitor the clipboard of the infected machine. If a crypto\naddress is copied to the clipboard, the malware will switch it with the one provided by the\nthreat operator in the builder. This could result in the victim unknowingly transferring crypto\nto the attacker’s address.\n\n### How Eternity Miner Behaves\n\nCryptocurrency miners are used by attackers to steal the host’s computing power to mine\n[for crypto coins; this process is also known as cryptojacking. The miner used by Eternity is](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/05/outlaw-monero-cryptojacking-in-the-wild)\na .NET [XMRig miner that targets the Monero cryptocurrency. The following screenshot](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/12/lessons-from-the-front-line-threat-hunting)\nshown in Figure 14 is the output screen of a sample Telegram bot build for the miner.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 14 - Miner Telegram bot builder_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen launched, the miner will achieve persistence by placing a copy of itself in the\nWindows® startup folder. The XMRig miner is then injected into the “explorer.exe” process,\nwhere cryptocurrency mining operations begin. The miner will periodically send beacon\nupdates back to the C2 server.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe threat actors behind the Eternity Project have shown great determination in remaining\nprevalent in the current threat landscape. At the time of writing this report, a new update\nhas just been posted to the malware’s Telegram page stating, “Police have confiscated\nsome servers and devices, but a new domain has already been setup and services will be\nresuming as normal shortly.”\n\n_Figure 15 - Eternity Telegram update about Police confiscation_\n\nThe Eternity project contains a wide range of customizable and updateable pieces of\nmalware to suit the needs of any attacker. A threat actor who decides to purchase any of\nthe available Eternity malware can customize it in such a way that each piece of malware\nwill have unique IoCs. This customizability allows the evolution of the malware to continue,\nwhile making threat hunting more difficult.\n\n\n-----\n\nContinued growth of the Eternity Project and its malware offerings is expected in the coming\nmonths. This will possibly include a DDoS bot, reportedly in development by the threat\nactor. From the Telegram pages used by the threat actors and their malware customers, it\nappears that the primary distribution methods will continue to be through YouTube videos,\nDiscord links and email attachments. To guard against Eternity-based attacks, it is important\nthat users stay extra vigilant when interacting with any of these services.\n\n### Mitigation Tips\n\nSome steps that can be put in place to mitigate the effects of the attacks mentioned in this\nreport include:\n\nPut into place a recovery plan to safely maintain multiple copies of sensitive or\nproprietary information.\nAvoid downloading cracked software, or software from unknown/unverified links, and\ncreate rules that prevent employees from doing this.\nMake sure corporate login credentials and personal passwords are not saved in your\nbrowser.\nApplication Configuration Hardening: Modify application configurations to reduce its\n[attack surface (MITRE D3FEND™ technique
