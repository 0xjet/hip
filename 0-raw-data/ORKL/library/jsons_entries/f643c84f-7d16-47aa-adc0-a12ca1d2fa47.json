This outcome is hardly surprising given that the accused’s alleged alter ego has\nbeen relentless in seeking media attention for this global crime machine.\n\nSchuchman, in an undated photo posted online and referenced in a “dox,” which alleged in Feb.\n\n2018 that Schuchman was Nexus Zeta.\n\n_The Daily Beast‘s Kevin Poulsen broke the_ [news last week that federal authorities in Alaska](https://www.thedailybeast.com/newbie-hacker-fingered-for-monster-botnet?ref=home)\nindicted Kenneth Currin Schuchman of Washington on two counts of violating the\nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act by using malware to damage computers between August\nand November 2017.\n\nThe [3-page indictment (PDF) is incredibly sparse, and includes few details about the meat of](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Schuchman.pdf)\nthe charges against Schuchman. But according to Poulsen, the charges are related to\nSchuchman’s alleged authorship and use of the Satori botnet. Satori, also known as\n“Masuta,” is a variant of [the Mirai botnet, a powerful IoT malware strain that first came online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware))\nin July 2016.\n\n“Despite the havoc he supposedly wreaked, the accused hacker doesn’t seem to have been\nterribly knowledgeable about hacking,” Poulsen notes.\n\nSchuchman reportedly went by the handle “Nexus Zeta,” the nickname used by a fairly\ninexperienced and clumsy ne’er-do-well who has tried on multiple occasions to get\nKrebsOnSecurity to write about the Satori botnet. In January 2018, Nexus Zeta changed the\n\n\n-----\n\n[login page for his botnet control panel that he used to remotely control his hacked routers to](https://blog.newskysecurity.com/masuta-satori-creators-second-botnet-weaponizes-a-new-router-exploit-2ddc51cc52a7?gi=8e5a55eb1727)\ninclude a friendly backhanded reference to this author:\n\nThe login prompt for Nexus Zeta’s IoT botnet included the message “Masuta is powered and hosted\n\non Brian Kreb’s [sic] 4head.” To be precise, it’s a 5head.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time Nexus Zeta said hello. In late November 2017, he chatted me up on\non Twitter and Jabber instant message for several days. Most of the communications came\nfrom two accounts: “9gigs_ProxyPipe” on Twitter, and ogmemes123@jabber.ru\n(9gigs_ProxyPipe would later change its Twitter alias to Nexus Zeta, and Nexus Zeta himself\nadmitted that 9gigs_ProxyPipe was his Twitter account.)\nIn each case, this person wanted to talk about a new IoT botnet that he was “researching”\nand that he thought deserved special attention for its size and potential disruptive impact\nshould it be used in a massive Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack aimed at\nknocking a Web site offline — something for which Satori would soon become known.\n\n\n-----\n\nA Jabber instant message conversation with Nexus Zeta on Nov. 29, 2017.\n\nNexus Zeta’s Twitter nickname initially confused me because both 9gigs and ProxyPipe are\nnames claimed by Robert Coelho, owner of [ProxyPipe hosting (9gigs is a bit from one of](https://www.proxypipe.com/)\nCoelho’s Skype account names). Coelho’s sleuthing was quite instrumental in helping\nto unmask 21-year-old New Jersey resident Paras Jha as the author of the original Mirai IoT\nbotnet (Jha later [pleaded guilty to co-authoring and using Mirai and is due to be sentenced](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/mirai-iot-botnet-co-authors-plead-guilty/)\nthis month in Alaska and New Jersey). “Ogmemes” is from a nickname used by Jha and his\nMirai botnet co-author.\n\n[On Nov. 28, 2017, 9gigs_ProxyPipe sent a message to the](https://twitter.com/9gigs_ProxyPipe/status/935543081549537281) [KrebsOnSecurity Twitter account:](https://twitter.com/briankrebs)\n\n“I have some information in regards to an incredibly dangerous IoT botnet you may find\ninteresting,” the Twitter message read. “Let me know how you would prefer to communicate\nassuming you are interested.”\n\nWe connected on Jabber instant message. In our chats, Ogmemes123 said he couldn’t\nunderstand why nobody had noticed a botnet powered by a Mirai variant that had infected\nhundreds of thousands of IoT devices (he estimated the size of the botnet to be about\n300,000-500,000 at the time). He also talked a lot about how close he was with Jha. Nexus\nZeta’s Twitter account profile photo is a picture of Paras Jha. He also said he knew this new\nbotnet was being used to attack ProxyPipe.\n\nLess than 24 hours after that tweet from Nexus Zeta, I heard from ProxyPipe’s Coelho. They\nwere under attack from a new Mirai variant.\n\n“We’ve been mitigating attacks recently that are about 270 gigabits [in volume],” Coelho\n[wrote in an email. “Looks like somebody tagged you on Twitter pretending to be from](https://twitter.com/9gigs_ProxyPipe/status/935543081549537281)\nProxyPipe — likely the attacker? Just wanted to give you a heads up since that is not us, or\nanyone that works with ProxyPipe.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom reviewing Nexus Zeta s myriad postings on the newbie-friendly hacker forum\n[Hackforums-dot-net, it was clear that Nexus Zeta was an inexperienced, impressionable](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=hackforums&x=0&y=0)\nyoung man who wanted to associate himself with people closely tied to the 2017 whodunnit\nover the original Mirai IoT botnet variant. He also asked other Hackforums members for\nassistance in assembling his Mirai botnet:\n\nSome of Nexus Zeta’s posts on Hackforums, where he asks for help in setting up a Mirai botnet\n\nvariant. Click to enlarge.\n\nIn one conversation with Ogmemes123, I lost my cool and told him to quit running botnets or\nelse go bore somebody else with his quest for publicity. He mostly stopped bugging me after\nthat. That same day, Nexus Zeta spotted [a tweet from security researcher](https://twitter.com/9gigs_ProxyPipe/status/936443244547751936) [Troy Mursch about](https://www.twitter.com/bad_packets)\nthe rapid growth of a new Mirai-like botnet.\n\n“This is an all-time record for the most new unique IP addresses that I’ve seen added to the\nbotnet in one day,” Mursch tweeted of the speed with which this new Mirai strain was\ninfecting devices.\n\nFor weeks after that tweet, Nexus Zeta exchanged private twitter messages with Mursch and\n[his team of botnet hunters at Bad Packets LLC in a bid to get them to Tweet or write about](https://badpackets.net/)\nSatori/Masuta.\n\nThe following screenshots from their private Twitter discussions, republished with Mursch’s\npermission, showed that Nexus Zeta kept up the fiction about his merely “researching” the\nactivities of Satori. Mursch played along, and asked gently probing questions about the size,\nmakeup and activities of a rapidly growing Satori botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\n9gigs_ProxyPipe (a.k.a. Nexus Zeta allegedly a.k.a Kenneth Schuchman) reaches out to security\n\nresearcher Troy Mursch of Bad Packets LLC.\n\nEarly in their conversations, Nexus Zeta says he is merely following the visible daily Internet\nscanning that Satori generated in a constant search for newly infectable IoT devices. But as\ntheir conversations continue over several weeks, Nexus Zeta intimates that he has much\ndeeper access to Satori.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this conversation from Nov. 29, 2017 between Nexus Zeta/9gigs_Proxypipe and Troy Mursch, the\n\nformer says he is seeing lots of Satori victims from Argentina, Colombia and Egypt.\n\nAlthough it long ago would have been easy to write a series of stories about this individual\nand his exploits, I had zero interest in giving him the attention he clearly craved. But thanks\nto naivete and apparently zero sense of self-preservation, Nexus Zeta didn’t have to wait\nlong for others to start connecting his online identities to his offline world.\n\n[On Dec. 5, Chinese cybersecurity firm Netlab360 released a report on Satori noting that the](https://blog.netlab.360.com/wa-a-new-mirai-variant-is-spreading-in-worm-style-on-port-37215-and-52869/)\nIoT malware was spreading rapidly to Chinese-made Huawei routers with the help of two\nsecurity vulnerabilities, including one “zero day” flaw that was unknown to researchers at the\ntime. The report said a quarter million infected devices were seen scanning for vulnerable\nsystems, and that much of the scanning activity traced back to infected systems in Argentina,\nColombia and Egypt, the same hotspots that Nexus Zeta cited in his Nov. 29 Twitter chat with\nTroy Mursch (see screen shot directly above).\n\n[In a taunting post published Dec. 29, 2017 titled “Good Zero Day Kiddie,” researchers at](https://research.checkpoint.com/good-zero-day-skiddie/)\nIsraeli security firm CheckPoint pointed out that the domain name used as a control server\nto synchronize the activities of the Satori botnet — nexusiotsolutions-dot-net — was\n\n\n-----\n\nregistered in 2016 to the email address nexuszeta1337@gmail.com. The CheckPoint report\nnoted the name supplied in the original registration records for that domain was a “Caleb\nWilson,” although the researchers correctly noted that this could be a pseudonym.\n\nPerhaps the CheckPoint folks also knew the following tidbit, but chose not to publish it in\ntheir report: The email address nexuszeta1337@gmail.com was only ever used to register a\nsingle domain name (nexusiotsolutions-dot-net), according to a historic WHOIS record\nsearch at [Domaintools.com [full disclosure: DomainTools is an advertiser on this site.] But](https://www.domaintools.com/)\nthe phone number in that original domain name record was used to register one other\ndomain: zetastress-dot-net (a “stresser” is another name for a DDoS-for-hire-service). The\nregistrant name listed in that original record? You guessed it:\n\nRegistrant Name: kenny Schuchman\nRegistrant Organization: ZetaSec Inc.\nRegistrant Street: 8709 Ne Mason Dr, No. 4\nRegistrant City: Vancouver\nRegistrant State/Province: Washington\nRegistrant Postal Code: 98662\nRegistrant Country: US\nRegistrant Phone: +1.3607267966\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\nRegistrant Fax:\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\nRegistrant Email: kenny.windwmx79@outlook.com\n\nIn April 2018 I heard from a source who said he engaged Nexus Zeta in a chat about his\nrouter-ravaging botnet and asked what kind of router Nexus Zeta trusted. According to my\nsource, Nexus Zeta shared a screen shot of the output from his wireless modem’s Web\n[interface, which revealed that he was connecting from an Internet service provider in](https://whois.domaintools.com/96.60.80.101)\nVancouver, Wash., where Schuchman lives.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Satori botnet author shared this screen shot of his desktop, which indicated he was using an\nInternet connection in Vancouver, Washington — where Schuchman currently lives with his father.\n\n“During our discussions, I learned we have the same model of router,” the source said. “He\nasked me my router model, and I told him. He shared that his router was also an ActionTec\nmodel, and sent a picture. This picture contains his home internet address.”\n\nThis matched a comprehensive “dox” that someone published on Pastebin in Feb. 2018,\ndeclaring Nexus Zeta to be 20-year-old Kenneth Currin Schuchman from Vancouver,\nWashington. The dox said Schuchman used the aliases Nexus Zeta and Caleb Wilson, and\nlisted all of the email addresses tied to Nexus Zeta above, plus his financial data and\nphysical address.\n\n“Nexus is known by many to be autistic and a compulsive liar,” the dox begins.\n\n“He refused to acknowledge that he was wrong or apologize, and since he has\nextremely poor opsec (uses home IP on everything), we have decided to dox him.\n\nHe was only hung around by few for the servers he had access to.\n\nHe lies about writing exploits that were made before his time, and faking bot counts on\nbotnets he made.\n\nHe’s lied about having physical contact with Anna Senpai (Author of Mirai Botnet).”\n\nAs detailed in the Daily Beast story and Nexus Zeta’s dox, Schuchman was diagnosed with\n[Asperger Syndrome and autism disorder, and at one point when he was 15 Schuchman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome)\nreportedly wandered off while visiting a friend in Bend, Ore., briefly prompting a police search\n[before he was found near his mother’s home in Vancouver, Wash.](https://www.bendbulletin.com/home/1972201-151/missing-teen-found-in-vancouver-wash)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Nexus Zeta clearly had limited hacking skills initially and almost no operational security.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security)\nIndeed, his efforts to gain notoriety for his illegal hacking activities eventually earned him just\nthat, as it usually does.\n\nBut it’s clear he was a quick learner; in the span of about a year, Nexus Zeta was able to\nprogress from a relatively clueless newbie to the helm of an international menace that\nlaunched powerful DDoS attacks while ravaging hundreds of thousands of systems.\n\n\n-----",
