The**\n\nattribution, based on several elements found within the malicious document, was\n\nfirstly reported by a security researcher through a social network.\n\nThe above-mentioned document, which also had a name potentially compatible with\n\nthe interests and objectives pursued by the threat actor in question, can be uniquely\n\nidentified by the following indicators:\n\n**Type** **Value**\n\n\n**SHA256**\n\n**File Name**\n\n\n7007f35df3292a4ecd741839fc2dafde471538041e54cfc24207d9f49016dc77\n\nAzerbaijan-Turky Military Negotiation.doc\n\n\nAccording the extracted evidences, the author “signed” this malicious document\n\nleaving his/her username within the document metadata. This nickname was already\n\nwidely known within the Cyber Threat Intelligence field because attributed to a member\n\nof the already mentioned threat group.\n\nIndeed this nickname is Iamfarhadzadeh, linked to Mohammad Farhadzadeh, believed\n\nto be a member of the hacking unit identified by the community as APT34 / OilRig.\n\nConsidering this threat and proceeding further with our analysis we extracted several\n\nevidences that highlighted a connection with a common _cyber-crime adversary. In_\n\nparticular the execution of the hidden macro permitted to download a copy of a\n\nmalicious executable identified as a variant of **AgentTesla that, to the best of our**\n\ninformation, has no ties to the already reported threat actor.\n\nThese evidences headed our research team to dig further in order to understand who\n\nwas behind this campaign and why that nickname was left within the meta-content.\n\nOur first hypothesis was a deliberate attempt to deceive security researchers pushing\n\nthem to attribute the malicious campaign to a cyber-espionage operation by releasing\n\na malicious document linked to a socio-politic event.\n\n**Telsy SpA - TLP : WHITE** 3\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ……………………………………….……………………………………………………………………..\n\n### Insights\n\nOur investigation covered a quite extended timeframe and permitted to continuously\n\nmonitor the attackers activities and, with a wider point of view, what is lately\n\nhappening within the cyber-crime panorama and how these cyber criminals act.\n\nTo better clarify, we tracked and observed the use of tools to quickly create new\n\nphishing campaigns aimed to steal data and information that could be sold on the dark\n\nmarket or used to directly cause an economic loss to their victims.\n\nIn details, the analyzed document, contains a hidden macro that through the\n\nsubroutine **_auto_run runs automatically the obfuscated VBA code downloading a_**\n\nmalicious payload from the following URL\n\n**Type** **Value**\n\n**URL** https://cannabispropertybrokers.com/pop/8OwWKrFQ0gQoKt9.exe\n\nto be later implanted within the victim’s temp folder. Following same evidences about\n\nthe encoded URL as observed during the analysis the extracted payload matched\n\nexactly with AgentTesla payloads.\n\nThis means that once executed the malware is able to record keystrokes, to collect user\n\n_clipboard data, to get_ _screenshots from the victim machine and to send all to the_\n\nattacker command and control.\n\n**Telsy SpA - TLP : WHITE** 4\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ……………………………………….……………………………………………………………………..\n\n### Actor Profile\n\nThe analysis gave us also the opportunity to establish an attacker “fingerprint”, to\n\ndeeply track it, to study all its actions and to learn about tools and methods it used to\n\nstart and deploy a new malware campaign and operations.\n\nWe identified infected victims but also all information related the attacker’s host. We\n\ngot evidences that the actor was likely a member of a cyber-crime team with a low\n\nknowledge about packers, evasion techniques and malware in general. Furthermore,\n\nwe observed that he repeatedly executed his own malicious payloads over his\n\nmachines from which the campaigns are operated.\n\nAmong all data about the threat actor, we collected several IP addresses used by\n\nattacker as bridges in order to pack malicious documents and spread phishing waves.\n\nAll of these servers are reachable via RDP services.\n\nA quite funny part of our investigation involved also evidences about Skype and ICQ\n\naccounts of the crew that are currently used for sharing and exchanging compromised\n\nassets and emails with other cyber-criminals.\n\nIt is interesting to note that, during the preparation phases of the campaigns, the\n\nthreat actor seemed to act by choosing potential targets on the basis of very specific\n\naddress lists, probably cataloged on the basis of the sector of interest.\n\nFor example, while preparing campaigns aimed at compromising entities operating in\n\n**Oil&Gas sector, the collected evidences suggest a web browsing activity performed by**\n\nthe adversary towards websites dedicated to news about industrial groups operating\n\nin this sector.\n\nOne of these websites, which cybercriminals rely on to acquire information about the\n\n**Oil&Gas industry, is ognnews.com, showed within the screenshot reported here below:**\n\n**Telsy SpA - TLP : WHITE** 5\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ……………………………………….……………………………………………………………………..\n\nIn other cases members of the crew search directly in darkweb websites dedicated to\n\nthe provision of _phishing kits and lists of email addresses to be included among_\n\npotential targets. We tracked at least 8 different underground forums consulted by the\n\ngroup for purchasing compromised _assets and get tools to obfuscate malware. In_\n\nparticular, threat actor seems to prefer buy and use a malware _core which can be_\n\nreferred to as OriginLogger. OriginLogger in conjunction with the use of an online PE\n\n_crypter, called_ **Cassandra, generates malicious payloads internally matching**\n\n**AgentTesla's signatures.**\n\n**_Cassandra crypter weblogin page_**\n\n**Telsy SpA - TLP : WHITE** 6\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ……………………………………….……………………………………………………………………..\n\nFurthermore, in order to have a clearer view about the spread of the threat, an ad-hoc\n\nsignature has been internally created for the malware family in question, starting from\n\nthe sample identified by the following hash:\n\n**Type** **Value**\n\n**sha256** cda07296d20a239bdb9cb5a2c9a814f69811bc85ced8bf32e998b906a413f416\n\nThis signature made it possible to obtain a good level of detection with a low false\n\npositive rate. As the image below reports, starting from the second week of October\n\n2020, the group began to heavily spread “OriginLogger _plus_ **Cassandra” payloads,**\n\ninternally reaching a number of unique detections exceeding the 500 hits from mid\nOctober until dropping around only 10 to December 1, 2020 (this is probably as a\n\nconsequence of the increase in the global detection rates of the variants in question).\n\n**_Telsy Threat Intelligence SecOps Platform_**\n\n### Victimology\n\nThreat actor targeted many entities and organizations across different industrialized\n\ncountries, including Italy. The operations involved as well many individual users.\n\nWe counted around at least **300 Italian email addresses as targets of phishing**\n\ncampaigns operated by this adversary from mid-October 2020. Among the most\n\nimpacted sectors we observed **_industry,_** **_manufacturing,_** **_transports,_** **_energy and_**\n\n**_oil&gas._**\n\nAccording to the collected evidences below are reported details about to the countries\n\nwhere victims of these phishing campaigns are located:\n\n**Telsy SpA - TLP : WHITE** 7\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ……………………………………….……………………………………………………………………..\n\n### Attribution\n\nOur internal Threat Intelligence Research Team links the threat actor in question with\n\na _criminally-motivated organization operating from_ **Nigeria. The techniques, tactics**\n\nand procedures observed overlaps with a threat actor described in a research paper by\n\nNTT, dated October 2020, available at URL\n\n_https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/gtic-monthly-threat-report/gtic-_\n\n_monthly-threat-report-october-2020.pdf_\n\nIn this paper, **NTT researchers described malicious campaigns and BEC operations**\n\nperpetrated by an actor operating from Nigeria, they named OZIE Team. As many of\n\nthe characteristics of the adversary we tracked overlap with what is reported in the\n\naforementioned document, we assert, with a medium degree of confidence, that the\n\nthreat actor in question is part of or is potentially close to the OZIE gang.\n\n**Telsy SpA - TLP : WHITE** 8\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ……………………………………….……………………………………………………………………..\n\n### Credits\n\nTelsy internal research team has been supported by the collaboration of several\n\nindependent security researchers during the acquisition and analysis phases of parts\n\nof the artifacts and evidences collected. Among these we thank Vito Alfano\n\n(@vxsh4d0w) for his precious support and collaboration.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Type** **Value**\n\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**sha256**\n\n**hostname**\n\n**hostname**\n\n**hostname**\n\n\nd9335a58ec7d9016258640393f0cedf4a574ae6bf9e262772ac0b21be1b3f160\n\n25b747c5b79774e91f72f07b81819b9d1548d958247b81a72dca223cda2182b0\n\n168cddae42f300dbf9a398a79ed28f7d18d35791b02f13b14509e4a8c23b5a9b\n\n907040c91f9b0dbe13ce4b1fc5b96774a578625a1b023684ef78d1c16b6e89ce\n\n2fb00f8374b1b111ed9061a709b35c8cbfa8ad60bf27669c5a1a77385af514c1\n\nba27b84be509f5707480a79966f02ee8a976baac8e68793a8ce9cf35ed9be0fd\n\n3943281b88b1c4d3afabc6f0db027b3933a0b3dcf22c13bd37103fa33d851d13\n\n7dd928a1dbfb9e75e2c8832736810e328b2f6e8203dbf19c35edbcebb22a108a\n\ncbccebda97f3a276ac939e5e1502630e4cf981eb9c16dd80dddc3b6517d4d272\n\n814c32d56b92bf4eca814173f27b46d0b9eb21cc76f356a17af01416f04bf691\n\n9d0872926896a0efc6f5e2dc9ac2c7c62d1c29837b238daab47515fcc43a8e51\n\nab84cfaadbedc68ed1a9bcdd5b43cc1f64ce4a60e14d0a8b7eaada88dc99f896\n\nfca6883b6508568056870e73b092d979af35f79b0665ff62c078909187c87eee\n\n02e069ca6d3d262d8e663981a1ace8aba1e44c1106e5c1f434b05e80f2eef19b\n\n26345084cbd7f3571599ead41cde209b46e5a9633b4b6d0e4c5ba379d3ffa4b8\n\ncda07296d20a239bdb9cb5a2c9a814f69811bc85ced8bf32e998b906a413f416\n\n15170d0dbe467efc4e38156ed4e03702ae19af44c100d7df7a75c6dbdb7ac587\n\n2d31a07b636024d8dbf8fc1533c7af7ee9720886995c001ba9a701f3a90f007c\n\n7f7041f099dec8c842ac0225e505bbf51d0a4bf6f1440b5ec7b2d10ebd894d05\n\n36a03ce4571347cee90c03067e2bae39ad80d597c8b40c430b37e4d6be96210e\n\n9e57f7e41d281935cc912f8d7066a6158071b1a79897455ce66cd17c5dd34f95\n\nmail.loanabank.com\n\nmail.dledcardetails.pt\n\nsmtp.opw-global.com\n\n\n**Telsy SpA -
