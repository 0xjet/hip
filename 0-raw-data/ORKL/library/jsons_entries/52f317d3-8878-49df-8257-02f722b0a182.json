The incident caused a massive\nbacklash from the underground community which once again provoked the release of\nthe blog by SongBird.\n\nThe actor claims that they wish to address the issue of constant misinformation and\nmisreporting originating from the Twitter community covering the ransomware subject.\n“SongBird” also denies any associations between DarkSide and BlackMatter except\nthat two ransomware share the same source code that “most likely has been\n_purchased from one of the DarkSide affiliates.”_\n\n**Background**\n\n**On September 7, 2021, a representative of the newly-formed Groove ransomware syndicate**\ndecided to share their insights and their perspective on the inner aspects of the ransomware\nbusiness.\n\nGroove ransomware was announced by a former Babuk operator and a founder of an\nunderground forum RAMP. Groove data leak website currently has one victim, a\nmanufacturing company based in Germany, whose exfiltrated data was published on August\n27, 2021.\n\nThe Groove representative primarily focused on discussing the inner relationships within the\nransomware community.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Hello! Lately, some of the researchers on Twitter began dumping tons of flawed_\n_information (about ransomware). As a direct participant of recent events, I want to bring_\n_clarity as some to make sure that the truth is presented to future generations”_\n\n**Actor “SongBird”**\n\nGroove representative is likely a threat actor operating under the alias “SongBird”\n(obfuscated) that is known to be a former Babuk operator and creator of an underground\nransomware-centered digital platform RAMP.\n\n_RAMP forum was launched on July 11, 2021, and was initially based on the former Babuk’s_\n_data leak website domain. Soon after the forum was relocated to the new domain where it_\n_successfully operates to this date. The forum is entirely dedicated to providing coordination,_\n_communication, and organizational support for the top cyber extortionists._\n\n\n-----\n\n_RAMP forum, 10 days in. Threat actor “SongBird” discusses the Registration Policy. Soon_\n_after the forum administrators implemented a new rule requiring new members to be_\n_screened and accepted by the forum moderator._\n\nGroove is a novel ransomware group that became especially active in August and\nSeptember 2021. Groove allegedly employs former Babuk developers and possesses\nadvanced tactics and tools. For instance, on September 7, 2021, the same day as the\npublication of the “Ransomware Thoughts” Groove released leaks of Fortinet VPN SSL\ncredentials via their leak website. The list contains 799 directories and 86,941 purportedly\ncompromised VPN connections. The reason behind the leak is unclear.\n\nThe breach list contains raw access to the top companies.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The geographical distribution of the Fortinet VPN SSL list includes 74 countries. 2,959 out of_\n_22,500 victims are US entities._\n\n**Babuk VS Groove. Ransomware Drama**\n\n\n-----\n\n**1. Babuk Beginning - the Development of Ransomware**\n\nAccording to the actor, at the end of summer (the year is unclear), they were approached by\nanother member of the underground with an offer to work on the development of\nransomware which later was presented as Babuk. The source code was successfully\nmodified and soon after tested against two manufacturing companies based in Europe, as\nwell as other businesses whose names the author did not disclose as these victims “paid the\n_ransom and fulfilled their contract, while we fulfilled ours” meaning that they can not share_\nany information regarding the attacks. They conclude “everything worked for me, the product\n_was satisfying.”_\n\n**2. “The Netherlands Cheese Crisis” Causing The Rift Within the Syndicate**\n\nSoon after, in early April 2020, Babuk attacked a Dutch transport company, possibly using a\nMicrosoft Exchange server CVE (which has been particularly trending as an attack vector for\nransomware groups in April and May 2020). The attack has led to the supply chain disruption\nand the limited availability of prepackaged cheese in the Netherlands.\n\n“SongBird” shares that due to the poor development of the source code, operators weren’t\nable to successfully decrypt the files and return the data even though the victim was\nreportedly willing to pay the ransom. This turned Babuk’s for-profit operation into a simple\ndamaging and destructive attack with no benefit and compromised the group’s reputation.\nAccording to the Groove representative, the code was poorly written on purpose and they\nare still struggling to identify the motives behind it.\n\n**3. Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department Attack that Led to the Split of**\n**Babuk Team**\n\nAccording to the blog, one of the ransomware affiliates contacted Babuk offering access to\nthe police department. The ransomware attack occurred in May of 2021 when Babuk\noperators demanded $4 million USD in exchange for the decryption key. After a short period\n\n\n-----\n\nof negotiation and refusal of their victim to pay a ransom, the syndicate started to release\nwhat it claimed to be internal law enforcement data. The negotiation process ended in failure.\n\nSongBird claims that the negotiation failed due to the lack of pressure and\n“unprofessionalism” by their affiliate. The actor then decided to end the business relationship\nwith their former “colleagues”. It was agreed that SongBird would keep the domain (where\nthe threat actor later built RAMP forum) where the shame blog was based, while their affiliate\nwould keep the source code.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The attack on the police department became the turning point that led the initial team of the_\n_Babuk syndicate to disintegration. According to SongBird, they lost half of their team and_\n_were struggling to keep the domain, which was attacked by their former syndicate members._\n_Soon after SongBird was forced to relocate RAMP. 15 days prior to the official opening of the_\n_forum, the actor added:_\n\n_“The old team causes trouble. We agreed that they would take their source code and I would_\n_take the domain. Don't try to hurt me, I know your skills and what you are capable of as well_\n_as my skills too. If you keep interfering in my business I will start working against you (I have_\n_insiders).”_\n\n**4. From Colleagues to Enemies - Babuk Source Code Leak**\n\n**On September 3, 2021, a threat actor operating under the alias \"DY-2\" (obfuscated)**\nreleased what they claimed to be Babuk’s source code also stating that they are doing it as\nthey face a terminal stage of cancer. The actor \"DY-2\" in fact might be that initial syndicate\nmember who approached “SongBird” with the request to improve the source code - an event\nthat led to a Babuk ransomware development. (see point 1 - “Babuk Beginning”).\n\n\n-----\n\nDY-2 intentions to release the source code might have been a desire for simple revenge for\ntheir former colleague that quickly became one of the main competitors in the ransomware\nbusiness. “SongBird” in turn mentioned actor \"DY-2\" in their debut passage and claims that in\nreality the actor does not have a cancer diagnosis and is deliberately misleading the\nunderground community. They did not provide any further comments on the legitimacy of the\nsource code itself, however.\n\n_One of the alleged developers of Babuk ransomware created a major discussion across the_\n_underground forums when they claimed that due to cancer they are willing to share Babuk’s_\n_source code. The news was quickly transferred by English-speaking social media._\n\n**5. Epilogue - DarkSide & BlackMatter**\n\n“SongBird” denies any associations between DarkSide and BlackMatter except that two\nransomware share the same source code that “most likely has been purchased from one of\n_the DarkSide affiliates”_\n\nThey believe that BlackMatter has been initiated by some of the older affiliates of DarkSide.\nHowever, AdvIntel’s visibility into BlackMatter operation suggests that the group\ninstitutionalizes the mechanisms which were practiced not by DarkSide’s affiliates, but by\nDarkSide’s core leadership. Specifically, DarkSide founders were reportedly scamming their\naffiliates by intercepting victim negotiations and squeezing the affiliate of the process of\nobtaining ransom from the victim. This enabled the DarkSide founders to receive the entire\nransom payment and not provide affiliates with their percentage share.\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide performed this scheme by indirectly controlling the victim s negotiations chats and\ncreating hidden chats in which they continued negotiations, while the affiliate’s chat was\nblacked as if the victim was not responding. BlackMatter institutionalized this scheme openly\nstating within their panel that they have an ultimate right to intercept any victim chat and\nseize the negotiations from the affiliate at any point. This initialization of affiliate scamming\nschemes suggests that BlackMatter is more likely founded by the DarkSide core team and\nnot by their affiliates as suggested by “SongBird”.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe blog released by the Groove representative is a missing piece of a puzzle that allowed\nus to build a better picture of the Groove and Babuk conflict and take a closer look at the\nransomware ecosystem.\n\nThe personal disagreement between actors (most likely “SongBird” and \"DY-2\") that\ndeveloped within the syndicate led to the withdrawal from the group of one of them and to\nthe establishment of a new brand Groove. As both syndicates continue to exist, we are likely\nto see more drama coming our way.\n\nThis state of affairs demonstrates a complex ransomware ecosystem where new groups\nemerge as a result of the competition within larger gangs that fall apart and due to inner\nconflicts, while older groups attempt to rebrand in order to institutionalize the paradigms\nwhich they considered operationally existential.\n\n**Mitigations & Recommendations:**\n\nGroove group consists of ransomware specialists who have been extensively using the\nfollowing attack vectors - RDPs, Infrastructure Vulnerabilities, Software framework\nvulnerabilities.\n\nBased on these vectors, AdvIntel recommends addressing the following set of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Monitor externally exposed RDPs and RDP access sold on major underground\n\nmarketplaces.\n\n2. Monitor infrastructure vulnerabilities, especially Fortinet VPN SSL.\n\n3. Apply patching and rapid security updates for ransomware-exploited CVEs, specifically\n\nProxyLogon, latest Microsoft Exchange server CVEs, and OWA server CVEs.\n\nEndpoint Vulnerability Exposures for monitoring\n\nCVE-2019-0708 Bluekeep RDP vulnerability\n\nCVE-2021-27065 Microsoft Exchange server RCE\n\nCVE-2021-26857 Microsoft Exchange server RCE\n\nCVE-2020-0796 - SMBGhost “Bluecorona” RCE vulnerability\n\nCVE-2019-11510 Pulse VPN vulnerability\n\nCVE-2020-0829 Citrix scan vulnerability\n\nCVE-2021-21972 - vmware scan vulnerability\n\nMS17-010 “Eternalblue” vulnerability\n\nCVE-2019-19781 - Citrix netscaler vulnerability\n\nImportant offensive techniques to monitor\n\nT1562.001: Impair defenses: disable or modify tools\n\nT1070.001: Indicator removal on host: clear Windows Event Logs\n\nT1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\nT1486: Data encrypted for impact\n\nT1489: Service stop\n\nT1490: Inhibit System Recovery\n\n\n-----",
