This updated information changed our view on the evidence initially gathered\nby Unit 42 researchers.\n\nSpecifically, the domain oracle.zzhreceive[.]top was originally linked to TeamTNT operations due to the usage of the term\nzzhreceive, which has been witnessed within several TeamTNT operations. Given recent developments and the growing\nanalytic visibility within the cloud research community, this domain has now been attributed to the cryptojacking operations\nassociated with the group WatchDog. The following is an update of our original blog, more accurately aligned to the current\nintelligence community information regarding WatchDog’s mimicry of TeamTNT operations.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe copying and incorporation of cryptomining operational codebase or script functions have become a central behavioral\nindicator of cryptojacking groups and their operations. Unit 42 researchers have identified tactics, techniques and procedures\n(TTPs) used by the [TeamTNT cryptojacking group being used by the WatchDog cryptojacking group. The new scripts from](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/teamtnt/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWatchDog are overtly copying TeamTNT infrastructure naming conventions and using a known WatchDog C2 hosting system,\n199.199.226[.]117.\n\nWith the identification of these new WatchDog scripts, Unit 42 researchers found that techniques that have been synonymous\nwith the TeamTNT group have gone missing. For instance, the new scripts do not:\n\nUse the latest attack patterns, Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker API targeting, which were featured in two reports focusing on\n[TeamTNT operations, Black-T: New Cryptojacking Variant from TeamTNT and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/black-t-cryptojacking-variant/) Hildegard: New TeamTNT Cryptojacking\nMalware Targeting Kubernetes.\nExfiltrate any identified credentials found on the compromised cloud instances.\nUse the network scanning tool zgrab.\n\nResearchers have also observed that the new WatchDog scripts do not use the exploit-laden GoLang binaries traditionally\nassociated with WatchDog.\n\nWhile WatchDog is believed to be the author of these new scripts, several of the scripts were found within TeamTNT-owned\npublic malware repositories. It appears that WatchDog may be attempting to expand their cryptojacking operations, while\nsimultaneously masking their operations to appear more like the known cryptojacking operations performed by TeamTNT.\n\nThe stealing, hijacking or incorporation of cryptojacking TTPs within other cryptojacking operations has become a common\ntrend within cryptojacking groups. Most notably, TeamTNT was reported to have copied the code used to detect and remove\n[Alibaba Cloud Security from compromised instances from the Kinsing group. Also, cryptojacking groups such as “Rocke”](https://www.cadosecurity.com/post/team-tnt-the-first-crypto-mining-worm-to-steal-aws-credentials)\n[began as a forked GitHub repository from the cryptojacking operation created by “The 8220 Mining Group.” This operation](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/12/cryptomining-campaigns-2018.html)\n[shares up to 30% of its cryptomining code base with tools developed by the group “Pacha.” Pacha and Rocke were](https://csirt.cy/en/pacha-group-competing-against-rocke-group-for-cryptocurrency-mining-foothold-on-the-cloud/)\n[subsequently involved in a documented crypto war, which has lasted nearly two years. While little research has been written](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/85400/hacking/pacha-group-crypto-mining.html)\n[on recent Pacha operations, Rocke is still developing new malware.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pro-ocean-rocke-groups-new-cryptojacking-malware/)\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers running Prisma Cloud are protected from the threats presented in this report through the](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)\nRuntime Protection feature, Cryptominer Detection feature and the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes Compliance\nProtection, which alerts on an insufficient Kubernetes configuration and provides secure alternatives. Additionally, Palo Alto\n[Networks VM-Series and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/vm-series) [CN-Series products offer cloud protections that can prevent network connections from cloud](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/cn-series)\ninstances toward known malicious IP addresses and URLs.\n\n## New WatchDog Malware\n\nThere are two samples that show the evolution of WatchDog techniques to mimic TeamTNT operations,\n36ca9f84864ad022c255b7d91e75997f035716e4df5dc1c90ee2651f092f5d79 and\n49366ae4766492d94136ca1f715a37554aa6243686c66bf3c6fbb9da9cb2793d. These samples, first witnessed on Dec. 5 and\n11, 2020, respectively, show the direct replacement of the known WatchDog C2 infrastructure with new C2 infrastructure. As\nshown in Figure 1, the original WatchDog infrastructure, in the dark blue rectangle, has been commented out of the bash\nscript functionality and replaced with the new infrastructure seen in the light blue rectangle.\n\nFigure 1. WatchDog infrastructure\n\nreplacement.\nThe new script also makes use of the exact URL address directory tree pattern that is present within the known WatchDog\noperations, with the directories b2f628 (red) and b2f628fff19fda999999999 (orange), as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. URL directory pattern.\n\nThese two samples contain a hardcoded Monero (XMR) wallet address and an associated mining pool, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Monero wallet and\n\nassociated mining pool.\n\n**Mining Pools**\n\nIf these changes are indeed new TeamTNT behaviors, which is highly unlikely, it would represent the first time the TeamTNT\ncryptojacking operations have used a mining pool outside their traditional Monero mining pool, MoneroOcean[.]stream. This\ncryptojacking operation introduces two new mining pools never before known to be used by TeamTNT actors, but have been\nwitnessed within WatchDog operations. These mining pools are nanopool[.]org, shown in Figure 4, and f2pool[.]com, shown in\nFigure 5. The new mining pools are both instructed to use the Monero wallet address,\n43Xbgtym2GZWBk87XiYbCpTKGPBTxYZZWi44SWrkqqvzPZV6Pfmjv3UHR6FDwvPgePJyv9N5PepeajfmKp1X71EW7jx4Tpz.\n\nFigure 4.

F2pool mining operation.\n\n**Mining Pool Worker Information**\n\nOf note are the names of the mining pool workers associated with this Monero wallet address within the mining pools.\nAccording to nanopool[.]org records related to this Monero wallet address, there are a total of 20 unique workers, as shown in\nFigure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6.

However, the sample also includes the email address hilde@teamtnt[.]red, which\nis a known TeamTNT email address.\n\nFigure 9. Known\n\nWatchDog indicators of compromise (IoCs), as well as the TeamTNT email address.\nNow to the malware sample, 8adc8be4b7fa2f536f4479fa770bf4024b26b6838f5e798c702e4a7a9c1a48c6, which contains the\nnew WatchDog Monero wallet, as shown in Figure 10. The same MOxmrigMOD URL address as the known TeamTNT IoC\nshown within Figure 9 is present, but in this sample we also see additional URL addresses that have very strong ties to\nWatchDog infrastructure, specifically those involving the domain name oracle.zzhreceive[.]top.\n\nFigure 10. New\n\nIoCs analyzed in surrounding text.\nWith the presence of the C2 infrastructure from these new scripts, Figure 9 and Figure 10, both of which use the WatchDog\ndirectory, b2f628, there is a clear link to the TeamTNT infrastructure. The domain oracle.zzhreceive[.]top resolves to the IP\naddress 199.19.226[.]117, which is also the resolution IP address for the known TeamTNT subdomain\nzzhrecieve.anondns[.]net.\n\nThe usage of the anondns[.]net domain has been linked to several TeamTNT campaigns across multiple reports including,\n[irc.anondns[.]net,](https://blog.aquasec.com/fileless-malware-container-security) [ircbd.anondns[.]net,](https://www.lacework.com/teamtnt-builds-botnet-from-chinese-cloud-servers/) [sampan.anondns[.]net and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/hildegard-malware-teamtnt/) [teamtntisback.anondns[.]net. Additionally, the](https://www.cadosecurity.com/post/team-tnt-the-first-crypto-mining-worm-to-steal-aws-credentials)\n199.19.226[.]117 system has also been linked to WatchDog operations through the toolkit file 1.0.4.tar.gz,\n51de345f677f46595fc3bd747bfb61bc9ff130adcbec48f3401f8057c8702af9, which was hosted on\n[hxxp://global.bitmex[.]com[.]de/cf67355a3333e6/1.0.4.tar.gz and contains C code for the masscan utility, which is the same](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)\ntoolkit used in the TeamTNT operations. The bitmex[.]com[.]de URL had previously been linked to the WatchDog cryptojacking\ngroup.\n\n**TeamTNT Malware Repository**\n\nThe malware repository 85.214.149[.]236:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/ contains known TeamTNT malware that\nincludes the same files as the known TeamTNT repository\nhxxp://dockerupdate.anondns[.]net:443/sugarcrm/themes/default/images/, which is linked to TeamTNT via the malware\nsample [1aaf7bc48ff75e870db4fe6ec0b3ed9d99876d7e2fb3d5c4613cca92bbb95e1b, as shown in Figure 11.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/i/war-of-linux-cryptocurrency-miners-a-battle-for-resources.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Known TeamTNT malware repository.Of note, some the of\n\nmalware samples included in this repository were the Kubernetes and Docker-focused malware, ‘kube.jpg’ and ‘tshd’,\n[presented in Unit 42's Black-T blog, but these appear to no longer be used in the new scripts discussed within this blog. See](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/black-t-cryptojacking-variant/)\nthe appendix for a full listing of the known TeamTNT malware metadata collected from the malware repository.\nThe malware sample 0414946ab4bced2c1c41f4b8a75be672b34bbdee6f29e0a0bf7946b93f7044b1 is of note in this context\nas it contains the hardcoded IP address, 199.19.226[.]117, as well as the hardcoded Monero wallet address associated with\nthe nanopool and f2pool mining pools, and the mining workers previously discussed (Figures 12 and 13). As the previous\nsection mentioned, the IP address 199.19.226[.]117 also resolves to the known TeamTNT domain zzhrecieve.anondns[.]net.\n\nFigure 12. WatchDog directory using TeamTNT infrastructure.\n\nFigure 13. WatchDog\n\nMonero wallet address within TeamTNT infrastructure.Finally, another TeamTNT malware repository was identified by Unit 42\n[researchers, as shown in Figure 14. The larger Chimaera repository contains known TeamTNT cryptojacking scripts and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/teamtnt-operations-cloud-environments)\nbinary files. Within the spread/redis directory, the file b.sh,\n3b14c84525f2e56fe3ae7dec09163a4a9c03f11e6a8d65b021c792ad13ed2701, was found, which directly links TeamTNT to\nthe cryptojacking operations expressed in this report\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. TeamTnT repository containing\n\nthe b.sh script.\nThe b.sh script contains the 43xb TeamTNT and WatchDog Monero wallet address and points to the 199.19.226[.]117\nTeamTNT and WatchDog IP addresses (Figure 15). It also contains a hardcoded link to a known TeamTNT cloud enumeration\nscript hosted on the known TeamTNT domain borg[.]wtf, see Figure 16.\n\nFigure 15.\n\nTeamTNT and WatchDog XMR wallet and IP address. Figure\n\n[16. Known TeamTnT domain borg[.]wtf.The borg[.]wtf domain was linked to TeamTNT via a previous Unit 42 report. The](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/hildegard-malware-teamtnt/)\ncorrelations between TeamTNT and WatchDog are intrinsically connected with this b.sh script.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nConsidering the above evidence, it appears that WatchDog operations have incorporated the TTPs of the TeamTNT\ncryptojacking group and have significantly increased their own cryptojacking operations. The new WatchDog operation does\nnot appear to use the advanced functionalities TeamTNT has used recently, namely cloud credential scraping as well as\ntargeted Kubernetes- and Docker-focused lateral movement and exploit scripts.\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that the new operation does not incorporate the more advanced GoLang binaries traditionally associated\nwith WatchDog, which are capable of exploiting Windows- or NIX-based operating systems.\n\nIt appears that WatchDog actors are attempting to expand their cryptojacking operations, while simultaneously masking their\noperations with those of the known cryptojacking operations performed by TeamTNT. Unit 42 researchers will continue to\nmonitor this cryptojacking event and provide updates as needed.\n\nThe following tips are highly recommended by Unit 42 researchers to assist in the protection of cloud infrastructure.\n\nMonitor and block network traffic to known malicious endpoints.\nOnly deploy vetted container images within production environments.\nImplement and use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning platforms to prevent insecure cloud instances from being\ndeployed into production environments.\nUse cloud infrastructure configuration scanning tools that enable governance, risk management and compliance (GRC)\nto identify potentially threatening misconfigurations.\nUse cloud endpoint agents to monitor and prevent the running of known malicious applications within cloud\ninfrastructure.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud customers are protected from these threats through the Runtime Protection feature,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud)\nCryptominer Detection feature and the Prisma Cloud Compute Kubernetes Compliance Protection, which alerts on an\ninsufficient Kubernetes configuration and provides secure alternatives. Additionally, Palo Alto Networks [VM-Series and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/vm-series) CNSeries products offer cloud protections that can prevent network connections from cloud instances toward known malicious IP\naddresses and URLs.\n\n**Indicators of
