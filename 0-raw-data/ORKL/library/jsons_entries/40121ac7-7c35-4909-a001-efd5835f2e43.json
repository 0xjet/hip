    "plain_text": "# Missed opportunity: Bug in LockBit ransomware allowed free decryptions\n\n**[therecord.media/missed-opportunity-bug-in-lockbit-ransomware-allowed-free-decryptions/](https://therecord.media/missed-opportunity-bug-in-lockbit-ransomware-allowed-free-decryptions/)**\n\nMarch 17, 2021\n\nA member of the cybercriminal community has discovered and disclosed a bug in the LockBit\nransomware that could have been used for free decryptions.\n\nThe bug impacts [LockBit, a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that launched in](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.lockbit)\nJanuary 2020 and through which the LockBit gang rents access to a version of their\nransomware strain.\n\nCustomers of the LockBit RaaS, also known as “affiliates,” execute intrusions into corporate\nnetworks, where they deploy the ransomware to encrypt files and demand a ransom from\nvictims to provide a decryption key that unlocks their files.\n\nThrough a ransom note left on their desktop, LockBit victims are told to access a dark web\nportal where they can negotiate the ransom payment. This “payment” portal also allows\nvictims access to a one-time free decryption operation, so victims can confirm that the\nhackers have a legitimate and working copy of the decryption key.\n\n## LockBit bug posted on cybercrime forum\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a message posted on an underground cybercrime forum today, a threat actor has posted\ndetails about a bug in LockBit’s one-time free decryption mechanism that could have been\nabused for unlimited free decryptions.\n\n[#Malware](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Malware?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Ransomware](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ransomware?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#LockBit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LockBit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIn LockBit ransomware, clients found a bug that allows using trial decryptor infinitely.\nAlso, one client reminded about critical bugs due to not usable LockBit in big\nransomware attacks. [pic.twitter.com/D98Na8MZ7r](https://t.co/D98Na8MZ7r)\n\n[— 3xp0rt (@3xp0rtblog) March 16, 2021](https://twitter.com/3xp0rtblog/status/1371967330889129989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nGiving legitimacy to the disclosure, the bug was made public by Bassterlord, a suspected\nRussian-speaking threat actor who previously served as an affiliate for the LockBit\n[ransomware gang, but also other rival RaaS operations, such as REvil, Avaddon, and](https://therecord.media/i-scrounged-through-the-trash-heaps-now-im-a-millionaire-an-interview-with-revils-unknown/)\nRansomExx.\n\nWith details about the bug being posted in such a public manner, Bassterlord’s actions have\nalso sparked a discussion among security professionals about the proper way of reporting\nbugs in ransomware strains.\n\n[John Fokker, Head of Cyber Investigations & Principal Engineer at security firm McAfee,](https://twitter.com/John_Fokker)\ntold The Record that the proper way would be to report any ransomware-related bugs to a\n[security vendor or the No More Ransom project.](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\n\nBoth security vendors and the No More Ransom project have well-established mechanisms\nin place to take advantage of this information and help ransomware victims without alerting\nthe ransomware authors, Fokker said.\n\nThe McAfee exec said the advice applies to both independent security researchers but also\nunderground threat actors looking to sabotage their rivals. 😉\n\n## Bug expected to be patched\n\nJust like in previous instances when a bug in ransomware code was exposed, the LockBit\ngang is now expected to patch the issue within days, making future free decryption\noperations impossible. The LockBit portal was also conspicuously down all day today,\n[suggesting that fixes are possibly being implemented, Marcelo Rivero, a Malware](https://twitter.com/MarceloRivero)\nIntelligence Analyst at security firm Malwarebytes told The Record.\n\nIn addition, several other members of the security community have also told The Record that\nthe LockBit bug was something they were not aware of and which could have been very\nuseful.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt may not have been possible to decrypt large batches of files at once without alerting the\nLockBit crew, but the bug could have been used to decrypt selected sensitive files for which\nbackups did not exist.\n\nCurrently, the LockBit ransomware is one of the most active ransomware groups today.\nSecurity firm Coveware listed the LockBit ransomware as one of the top 15 ransomware\nstrains in Q4 2020.\n\n[According to data provided by the ID-Ransomware platform, the LockBit operation still infects](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/)\ntens of victims every week.\n\nLockBit submissions to ID-Ransomware service (Image via MalwareHunterTeam)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record. He previously worked at ZDNet\nand Bleeping Computer, where he became a well-known name in the industry for his\nconstant scoops on new vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and law enforcement actions against\nhackers.\n\n\n-----",
