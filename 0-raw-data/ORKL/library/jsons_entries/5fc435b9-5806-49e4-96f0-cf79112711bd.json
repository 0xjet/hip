The Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC) has\nobserved a new phishing campaign that aims to harvest Microsoft login credentials by posing\n\n\n-----\n\nas a company-wide sick/medical leave policy update.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1-2: Email Body_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sender s email address is spoofed to appear as though the email is originating from the\ncompany’s SharePoint services by using the format “Sharepoint@[companyname].com“.\nHowever, one look into the email’s header information shows that this is not the case and\nthat the email originated from outside of the organization, potentially from a\ncompromised account operated by the threat actor.\n\nThe email body itself is put together well and, at a glance, appears as though it could be\nlegitimate. It even contains little details such as “This link will only work for anyone at\n\n[company name]” and “Microsoft OneDrive for [user’s email].” The threat actor has spoofed a\nlegitimate Microsoft notification to appear legitimate, using a format the recipient would\nquickly trust at first glance. Since the file being shared refers to the company’s approach on\nsick leave during COVID-19, users are naturally going to be curious about what their\ncompany is doing for them.\n\nThe glaring flaw with the email body is where it references both Microsoft OneDrive\nand SharePoint. Since the spoofed email address is attempting to trick the user into thinking\nthis is a shared SharePoint file, it does not make sense for the email body to reference both\nof these services. It thus raises suspicion. The button users are intended to click also\nreferences OneDrive and, hovering over it, it reveals that the domain of the destination\n(oraclecloud[.]com) has nothing to do with Microsoft. It is apparent that this is not what it\nclaims to be.\n\nUpon visiting the malicious URL, users are taken to a fake Microsoft login page as shown in\nFigure 3.\n\n_Figure 3: Phishing Page_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email address field of the login is automatically populated with the user s email so they\nwould only have to include their password. The page even includes the company’s logo\nto more effectively pass the login off as legitimate. Once the credentials have been secured,\nthe user is then redirected to a page containing COVID-19 documentation, as seen in Figure\n4, that seemingly appears relevant to what was mentioned in the email. While many phishing\nattempts redirect the user to a legitimate login page, the use of this document instead is\nanother attempt to prevent the realization that the user’s credentials were just stolen.\n\n_Figure 4: Final Redirect Page_\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n\nhXXps://objectstorage[.]us-sanjose1[.]oraclecloud[.]com/n/ax7ybehehrcl/b/office-100345/o/index.html\n\n\n134[.]70[.]124[.]2\n\n\n**All third-party trademarks referenced by Cofense whether in logo form, name form or product form,**\n**or otherwise, remain the property of their respective holders, and use of these trademarks in no**\n**way indicates any relationship between Cofense and the holders of the trademarks.
