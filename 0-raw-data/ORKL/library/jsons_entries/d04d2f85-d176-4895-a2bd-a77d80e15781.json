Therefore, it’s possible to write malware in any language, too. But in\nboth cases, what’s possible isn’t always feasible. Performance issues, compatibility issues,\nthe availability of third-party libraries and useful primitives — all of these can spell the\ndifference between a huge success and a huge headache.\n\nMalware authors face “product specifications” unlike any other developer. They need their\nproduct to run silently, reliably, and with minimum user interaction. As a result, they will go to\ngreat lengths to avoid an extra dependency that requires separate installation, or an extra\ndialogue box that asks “are you sure?”. These things are usually just “nice-not-to-have”s, but\nfor malware authors, they directly hurt the campaign’s bottom line.\n\nThis contributes to somewhat of a monoculture in the malware landscape. A great majority of\nnotable malware is written in C language, or at best C++. These may not be the most\ndeveloper-friendly languages in the world (C language creator Dennis Ritchie sardonically\nnoted in 2011 that C has “all the power of assembly language, combined with all the\n\n\n-----\n\nconvenience of assembly language ), but the amount of example code and reference\nmaterials available for these languages is very great. More importantly, a well-built C binary\nlooks just like a legitimate program to the untrained eye, and runs without a hitch or a\ndialogue box. If we started listing current or historical high-profile malware that’s written in C\nor C++, we wouldn’t stop.\n\nStill, is this choice set in stone? How much of it is well-founded decision, rather than just\nattachment to the status quo? In this article, we explore that question via a review of some\nmalware where the authors chose otherwise. We’ll separate the chosen languages into\nrough categories (dynamic, VM and static), and ask ourselves: Was this a good choice? Is\nthis language — even this kind of language — a good fit for writing malware with, and why?\n\n**Easy, but There’s a Catch: Dynamic-Language Malware**\n\nThere is no single well-defined quality that makes a programming language “dynamic” or\n“static”. These are more terms of art than rigid definitions. A programming language will tend\nto be called “dynamic” if it has enough of the following characteristics:\n\n1. Dynamically typed: Types are only assigned to objects at run-time.\n2. Weakly typed: Type conversions can happen without the developer explicitly invoking\n\na conversion function.\n3. Garbage Collected: Memory management happens automatically at run-time, and is\n\ninvisible to the developer.\n4. Interpreted: Language instructions are converted into machine instructions as a part of\n\nthe execution process.\n\nSome well-known examples of languages generally considered “dynamic” are Lua,\nJavascript, PHP, Perl, and Python (which isn’t weakly typed). These stand in contrast to\n“static” languages, which have traditionally had these characteristics:\n\n1. Statically typed: Types are assigned to variables at compile time.\n2. Strongly typed: Type conversions can only happen if the developer explicitly invokes\n\na conversion function.\n3. Manual memory management: The developer is responsible for specifying correct\n\nallocation and de-allocation of memory at compile time.\n4. Compiled: Language instructions are all converted directly into machine instructions in\n\na separate step, which must be completed before the program can be run.\n\nThis category includes C, C++, Pascal and Fortran.\n\nOn paper, dynamic languages should be very attractive to malware authors. When using\nthem, the development process takes less time and is much less of a hassle — things “just\nwork”, and quickly. There are no long compilation times, barely any time spent satisfying the\n\n\n-----\n\ntype system, no boilerplate code to manage memory, and relatively little debugging before\nthe code’s first successful run from beginning to end. It’s a much breezier experience than\nusing “static” languages in general, let alone C.\n\nThat’s not to say Dynamic languages are without drawbacks. Garbage collection has a\nperformance cost; some run-time errors will get into production that a rigid type system\nwould’ve caught; and dynamic code is empirically known to not “scale” as well when the\nproject grows, due to the languages’ lax guarantees and fountain of implicit magic. Still,\nmalware authors don’t typically care about these issues. They don’t mind if the malware\ntakes 3 minutes to run instead of 10 seconds; they’d rather ship quickly than enjoy any\nfancy-pants guarantees on esoteric edge cases; and they certainly aren’t in it for the ‘scaling’\nexperience. From their point of view, you can live the dream of zero bugs, zero features, and\nzero technical debt – as long as you give zero priority to any of those aspects of software.\n\n[The Joy of Dynamic Languages (Credit: Randall Munroe)](https://xkcd.com/353/)\n\nSo why isn’t all malware just written in dynamic languages? Generally, it’s because:\n\n1. Some actors have the above attitude to maintaining projects, and then others don’t.\n\nThey aim high, and their goal is to build a robust product and a lucrative brand identity,\nwhere they get to sit and watch as other criminals fork over cash to participate in their\naffiliate program or to use their product in a separate campaign. Feature logs, bug\nfixes, and technical debt are not mere hassles to these actors, but legitimate concerns.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Dynamic languages typically require an interpreter to function, which may not even be\n\ninstalled at the victim machine. Socially engineering someone to double-click a file is\none thing, but socially engineering them to first install the Perl interpreter and then\ndouble-click the file is something else entirely.\n3. Victims are used to running compiled binaries. When you hand them a compiled binary\n\nand name it frog_blender.exe, they’ll just double-click it and get infected. The same\ngambit with an interpreted file will not work as easily. “Why does this file have a py\nextension instead of exe? Why is Windows asking whether I want to run or edit the file?\nWhy do I need to pick a program to run it with?”. A whole separate effort has to be\nmade to socially engineer the victim into running the code at all.\n4. In any language, some functions that are a malware author’s bread and butter — such\n\nas reading and writing to the registry, working with remote processes, and sending\nHTTP requests — will be absent from the language’s standard library. The difference is\nthat in a compiled language, these dependencies can be baked into the malware at\ncompile time, on the author’s end; but in the case of an interpreted language, the\nmalicious code looks for these dependencies at run time, on the victim machine, where\nthey are almost certainly missing.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The Sorrow of Dynamic Languages (Credit: Manu Cornet)](https://ma.nu/)\n\nDynamic code is typically much easier to analyze. Whole classes of anti-disassembly, antidebugging, anti-VM, anti-Analyst’s-will-to-live tricks are just out of reach when writing in a\ndynamic language. This is the result of several factors, and mostly the semantic gap\nbetween the interpreted script and the machine code that these techniques are typically\nwritten in. Also, interpreted malware doubles as its own source code, which is easier to\nunderstand and modify. Severely “obfuscated” scripts have been known to be de-obfuscated\nsingle-handedly by changing a single eval statement into a print.\n\n**Powershell Malware (MuddyWater, 2018; GhostMiner, 2018)**\n\nPowershell is a “task automation and configuration management\nframework” which Microsoft introduced in the year 2000. It is\nroughly analogous in function to Linux’s bash, which means that if\nyou want to do something, there’s probably a command for it.\nPowershell is built on top of Microsoft’s “.NET framework” —\nmeaning that similarly to Java, it ultimately runs on a specific\nVirtual Machine, created for this purpose.\n\nFor a dynamic language, Powershell is unusually suited to writing malware, as it\ncompensates for two of the drawbacks noted above. First, every version of Windows since\nXP ships with the Powershell interpreter included out of the box; second, all of Powershell’s\nfunctionality is accessible immediately without the need to download third-party code. This\nleaves merely the concerns of poor scalability, weaker obfuscation and the lack of built-in\nsocial engineering. Actors willing to tolerate these issues, or to do some work and\ncompensate for them, actually have the option to write their malware in a dynamic language,\nwith all the resulting productivity gains.\n\n[One notable campaign that went the Powershell route is MuddyWater, a backdoor operation](https://securelist.com/muddywater/88059/)\nattributed to an Iranian threat actor that’s been active since at least 2017. MuddyWater was\nmostly noted for an elaborate campaign targeted at the Saudi Arabian government, but has\nalso been known to pick targets in the US and Europe. A year after the campaign’s debut, in\n2018, Turkish public companies in the finance and energy sectors were hit with a malicious\ndocument campaign that, as its payload, basically had a Powershell rewrite of previouslyknown MuddyWater tools. The payload itself was moderately obfuscated by BASE64\nencoding, AES-encryption with a known key, and the hiding of some code fragments behind\nvariables named after colorful English swear words. Once you got past that, the backdoor\nitself was minimalistic in function, and mostly used Powershell’s facilities to easily perform\ntasks such as getting the victim’s system architecture and privileges. When using C, these\ntrivial tasks can require correctly chaining several calls from the Win32 API, which is\nnotorious for functions such as the succinctly-named\n[AccessCheckByTypeResultListAndAuditAlarmByHandleA that takes a mind-boggling 17](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-accesscheckbytyperesultlistandauditalarmbyhandlea)\nparameters.\n\n\n-----\n\nMuddyWater decoy document, with the blurred logo of the Kurdistan regional government.\n[(as initially outlined here)](https://twitter.com/_CPResearch_/status/1112789106638184449)\n\n[Another example of Powershell malware was GhostMiner, a fileless threat discovered by](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/ghostminer-cryptomining-malware-goes-fileless)\nresearchers at Minerva at 2018 that used its hapless victims’ CPU cycles to mine\ncryptocurrency. GhostMiner was a piece of technical art, combining ready-made pieces to\ncreate an unusually evasive infection chain. For its propagation phase, it acted akin to the\n[old-school Morris Worm, probing random IP addresses and targeting them with an exploit for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm)\n[a certain 1-day vulnerability (in this case CVE-2017-10271, a vulnerability in Oracle’s](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-10271)\n[WebLogic server). Post-exploitation, it used two separate evasion techniques, both released](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic.html)\nas open-source tools by legitimate penetration testers, to reflectively load a malicious DLL\n[from an obfuscated payload (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection and](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/CodeExecution/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1) [Out-CompressedDll).](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/ScriptModification/Out-CompressedDll.ps1)\n\n\n-----\n\nGhostminer code that removes competing miners from the victim system. (Credit: Minerva\nLabs)\n\nOne can see how both those choices were made to compensate for Powershell’s\nweaknesses as a tool of the malware craft. Exploiting a vulnerability — rather than the\nhuman element — meant that the attack could proceed without socially-engineering anyone\nto run a Powershell script. This insight has not escaped other actors, and as a result, in\nrecent years Powershell has seen wide use in “Fileless” malware built on the same principle.\nThis extends to other contexts where code is already running on the victim machine, such as\n[the tail of a malicious MS-Office macro attack (see for example here, as well as](https://www.varonis.com/blog/understanding-malware-free-hacking-part/) [this quaint](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/dnsmessenger-powershell-malware-analysis-2/)\nlittle backdoor which liaisons with its C&C server via DNS TXT entries). By using ready-made\nframeworks to handle evasion and obfuscation, the authors made sure that analyst\nfrustration when coming across this threat was at least moderate.\n\nThe only thing the attackers did not (and could not) compensate for was the language’s\nunsuitability for commitment to large, maintenance-heavy projects. But maybe that’s for the\nbest: analysts suspect that GhostMiner’s technical tour de force only managed to mine 1\nXMR, equivalent to a grand total of about $200.\n\n**Python Malware (Pbot, 2018)**\n\nFirst released by Guido von Rossum in 1991, the Python\nprogramming language pivoted off its simple syntax and\nlarge standard library to become a sort of lingua franca for\ndevelopers. It is one of the easiest programming language to\nlearn, if not the easiest, and one of the most fully-featured, in\nthat there’s a library for nearly everything you might want to\ndo. Python is the poster child for all the advantages of\ndynamic languages; if malware authors could just write all\ntheir malware in Python, all else being equal, they would.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately for them, things are not that simple. With respect to writing malware, Python\nhas all of Powershell’s pitfalls, and then all the rest of the issues with dynamic languages on\ntop of those. Python isn’t pre-installed by default on Windows, and so has to be installed\nseparately; also, many pieces of functionality that are essential to malware aren’t even\nincluded with the Python standard library, and so require third-party modules. For instance,\nnearly every malware will have to interact with the Windows registry and send HTTP\nrequests, but if you want to do that in idiomatic Python, you need to download a separate\nthird-party module for each of those actions (such as winreg and requests, respectively).\n\nAll of these concerns make Python malware rare — but, apparently, not unheard of. For\nsome malicious actors, the prospect of cutting down on 70% of their work with a few import\n[statements is just too good to pass up, and the result is strange creatures like Pbot.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/04/pbot-python-based-adware/)\n\nFragment of Pbot’s loader code. (Credit: MalwareBytes)\n\nPbot is a piece of python Adware, noticed by Malwarebytes researchers in early 2018. It\nspends a lot of energy clearing several of the hurdles outlined above. For instance, at the\ntime it was being spread via the RIG exploit kit, routing (again) around the requirement for\nsocial engineering. To deal with the fact that the victim may be missing the Python interpreter\nand/or the required libraries, Pbot does not deliver a raw .py script file, and instead delivers a\n\n\n-----\n\nlarge executable bundle which contains a complete Python environment and interpreter,\nincluding all the required dependencies. Bundles such as these can be created from Python\npackages using 3rd-party tools such as PyInstaller.\n\nPbot’s main functionality was a framework for injects and man-in-the-browser attacks.\nWithout access to Pbot’s configuration, one could only speculate on the exact monetization\nmodel that authors had in mind; but given that most malware with such functionality uses it to\nsteal banking credentials, and given that the malware came with a built-in whitelist of\nRussian banks to refrain from attacking, we can conclude that Pbot was probably a banking\nTrojan (the canonical example of such malware, ZeuS, was also known as Zbot).\n\nBy hitch-hiking on an exploit kit and using the executable bundle install, the authors of Pbot\nwere able to skirt some of the inherent problems of Python malware, but not all. The most\nglaring drawback is the particularly weak obfuscation, which the authors didn’t do much to\noffset (even leaving in some comments and debug strings). It may also be worth mentioning\nthat spam emails are still the most prolific attack vector, and that for cybercriminals, giving up\non spam and relying solely on exploit kits is likely a bitter trade-off.\n\nSchema of how an application written in a VM language (in this case, Java) can be run on\nmultiple platforms.\n\n**Some of Column A, Some of Column B: VM Language Malware**\n\nNot all languages can be stuffed neatly into the “static” or “dynamic” pigeon-hole. There’s a\nnotable set of programming languages which, on the one hand, are statically and strongly\ntyped, and have an explicit compilation step; but on the other hand, are garbage-collected,\nand are compiled to bytecode that’s only translated to machine code at run time by a\ndedicated VM. You may rightly ask where’s the difference between this so-called\n“compilation” and the flow of a fully interpreted language like, for example, Python, which\ndoes after all have its own VM for exactly the same purpose. Mainly, the difference is that a\n[VM language may easily lack a REPL (interactive prompt), whereas for a dynamic language,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)\nit’s a must-have feature; and that in a VM language, the bytecode translation must be\ninvoked by the developer explicitly and both it and the VM itself generally have proper\nspecifications, whereas in a dynamic language the conversion is invoked implicitly and is\n\n\n-----\n\nmore of a mere implementation detail. (If you re interested in a deeper dive into this shadowy\ncorner, we recommend [this blog post by Ned Batchelder). Some prominent examples of VM](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201803/is_python_interpreted_or_compiled_yes.html)\nlanguages are Java, Scala and Kotlin, all of which run on Oracle’s JVM; as well as C# and\nVB.NET, all of which run on Microsoft’s CLR.\n\nVM languages’ mishmash of characteristics puts them somewhere in the twilight zone\nbetween “static” and “dynamic”, with a resulting mix of pros and cons for malware\ndevelopers. These languages provide an immediate productivity boost over C, and their\nbytecode can be run on any OS that has the appropriate VM installed; on the flip side, they\nintroduce a glaring dependency in the form of the VM itself, as well as the challenge of\ngetting the victim to run a non-PE file (there’s also the performance overhead, but again,\nthat’s less important in the context of malware).\n\n**Java Malware (Jrat, 2012)**\n\nJava spent several years reigning as the most popular\nprogramming language on earth, and has a long and complicated\nhistory, fraught with patent lawsuits and corporate acquisitions. It\nis well-known for being an essential layer in the development\nstack of Android Apps, as well as a popular choice for server-side\nenterprise apps. Apart from its VM nature, Java is perhaps bestknown for its strong adherence to Object Oriented Programming\nprinciples: In Java, everything is an object (as lampooned in Steve\nYegge’s [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns).](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)\n\nIs Java a good choice for cybercriminals trying to write malware? That depends on how\nmuch they like Java’s Object-orientation, how much their campaign stands to gain from\nJava’s cross-platform reach, how much they care about obfuscation, and how much they are\nwilling to let victim conversion rates suffer. The tagline goes “15 Billion devices run Java”, but\nthe victim’s machine might not be one of them.\n\n[This apparently was not enough of a concern for the authors of JRat, a Remote](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-jrat-adwind-variant-being-spread-with-package-delivery-scam.html)\nAdministration Tool discovered by Fortinet in 2016. JRat supports a variety of commands,\namong them deleting victim files, sending screenshots to its C&C server, killing processes\nand visiting URLs (this last one may be used for DDOS attacks and click fraud). Unlike with\nPBot, which included all its bundled dependencies, JRat only targets machines which\nalready have Java installed.\n\nJRat is obfuscated to a reasonable standard for a dynamic language; all the package and\nvariable names are replaced with random gibberish, all the strings are split into many shreds\nthat are only assembled at run-time, and some of the functionality is buried behind an AESencrypted blob. While frustrating, these stumbling blocks still can’t hold a candle to the\nobfuscations and evasions one often encounters on classic-flavor C malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nJrat source containing obfuscated string shreds. (Credit: Fortinet)\n\nHappily, judging by JRat itself, we are still far away from the specter of true cross-platform\nmalware. The malware was not actually written fully in Java, and contained OS-specific\ncomponents which were executed depending on the victim OS. Also, according to analysis\nby Trend Micro, the authors did not fully implement all of the malware’s functionality for all\noperating systems, and instead showed clear “preferential treatment” to compatibility with\nWindows OS. This makes some sense, given that Windows OS is probably more familiar to\nthe malware authors and has a significantly larger market share — but if we put ourselves in\nthe authors’ shoes, we can’t help but see this choice as a missed opportunity.\n\n**We Fear It’s the Future: Ergonomic Static Language Malware**\n\nAs mentioned above, ergonomics for static languages have been historically poor, especially\nso for C language. This deficiency gave birth to dynamic and VM-based languages, but also\nproduced efforts to create new static languages with improved ergonomics. The most wellknown effort in this direction is old reliable C++, which introduced exceptions, operator\noverloading, improved memory management and built-in support for Object Oriented\nProgramming; yet during the years, has also inspired a litany of criticisms leveled at its adhoc patchwork design, Turing-complete template system and, most importantly, its manual\nmemory management. The last 20 years therefore saw many efforts to address these issues\nby creating “a better C++”, many of which failed to catch on and faded into obscurity.\n\nFor malware authors, the modern static languages in serious use today generally share the\nadvantages and disadvantages of static languages, apart from some differences. First, the\nergonomics tend to be much better but still can’t match the experience of writing in say\n\n\n-----\n\nPython. Second, these languages use stronger typing systems than C, which place more\nrestrictions on conversions between types. This improves scalability with respect to project\nsize, but means that some categories of clever tricks are right out, and the malware\ndeveloper may have come to rely on those in their coding style. Third, these languages are\ntypically new, with a smaller niche than C++, and so studying them is a costly, avoidable\ninvestment. Fourth, and related to the third: there is no large repository of leaked malicious\ncode to pick and choose from, and the third-party libraries are sometimes not mature by the\nstandard you’d come to expect from more established languages.\n\n**Golang Malware (Mirai, 2016; Zebrocy, 2019)**\n\n[Golang, which was created at Google in 2007, puts a particular](https://golang.org/)\nemphasis on readability, simplicity, built-in concurrency\nprimitives, and a minimal feature set. The authors reportedly\nwanted the language specification to be “small enough to hold\nin a programmer’s head”, and opted to leave out many complex\nfeatures (most notably [generic programming facilities), which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming)\nmakes the learning curve for Golang a treat. Golang is therefore\nan opportunity for malware authors if they are willing to put in\nthe moderate learning effort, and as long as they are also willing\nto roll up their sleeves and make do when otherwise they would have used a third-party\nlibrary or copy-pasted code from the leaked Gozi sources.\n\nSince 2012, the infosec world has been subjected to an intermittent drizzle of Golang\n[malware. Among the notable examples, one can find this tool that co-opts the victim machine](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/02/new-golang-brute-forcer-discovered-amid-rise-e-commerce-attacks/)\n[to assist in brute-forcing the credentials to phpMyAdmin and WordPress websites; WellMess,](https://fossbytes.com/wellmess-malware-go-linux-windows/)\na simple backdoor that allows remote execution of shell commands on the victim machine;\n[and we would be remiss not to mention the Mirai Botnet, a juggernaut made out of hundreds](https://medium.com/@cjbarker/mirai-ddos-source-code-review-57269c4a68f)\nof thousands of IoT devices that were compromised via credential brute-force, and was\n[infamously used to launch a gigantic denial of service attack against the blogging platform of](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/)\ninvestigative reporter Brian Krebs. (If you happen to have a spare hour, the follow-up\ninvestigation report by Krebs is really something.)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis open-source Golang code to retrieve the list of logged-in users was used verbatim in\nZebrocy. (Credit: Vitali Kremez)\n\nPerhaps the most technically notable incident was in late 2018, when a new variant surfaced\nof the [Zebrocy Downloader / Infostealer, a large piece of which was written in Golang. This](https://www.vkremez.com/2018/12/lets-learn-dissecting-apt28sofacy.html)\npiece of malware originated with the Sofacy Group (APT28), thought connected to the\n[Russian military intelligence agency GRU. According to researchers at Kaspersky, this new](https://securelist.com/a-zebrocy-go-downloader/89419/)\nvariant was mainly used to attack central Asian governments, and rode on the tail of a\ncomplex infection chain that lured victims to run an executable file with an icon mimicking\nthat of an MS-Word document. Post-infection, the malware displayed a decoy document to\nmitigate suspicion, which certainly implies some degree of author dedication.\n\n**Rust Malware (Exaramel Backdoor, 2017)**\n\n[Rust language was originally conceived at Mozilla Research, and](https://www.rust-lang.org/)\nits main feature is a “borrow checker” that enforces thread and\nmemory safety at compile time, removing the need for a run-time\ngarbage collector and making the language viable for real-time\nand embedded systems. Apart from that, Rust has a complex\ntype system, [mind-boggling iterator adapters and many other](https://danielkeep.github.io/itercheat_baked.html)\n[such features directly inspired by Haskell and its functional ilk.](https://www.haskell.org/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis Rust code performs a generalized rotating byte-wise encryption.\n\nOn the face of it, Rust is not a reasonable choice for malware authors. While practitioners\n[hold the language in high regard, it has a notoriously difficult learning curve, and solves](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/09/stack_overflow_survey/)\nproblems that cybercriminals don’t much care for. Maybe somewhere out there, there’s a\nmalware author with a passion for shaving 5% off their malware’ running time, running it on\n[embedded devices and implementing all the logic via zygohistomorphic prepromorphisms,](https://wiki.haskell.org/Zygohistomorphic_prepromorphisms)\nbut we suspect this person is the exception, rather than the rule.\n\n[Imagine our surprise, then, when we first heard of Linux.Backdoor.IRC, originally discovered](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=10193&lng=en&c=14)\nin 2016. It is a simple Rust backdoor that responds to commands via IRC protocol (some\nwould call this “old-school”), and supports a total of 4 commands: collect & send OS\ninformation to the C&C server; collect and send information about running processes on the\nvictim machine; connect to a specific chat channel; and self-destruct (delete self from file\nsystem). The analysts at Dr. Web, who discovered this curiosity, noted that the IRC channel\nwas not active and the malware appeared to lack any mechanism for self-propagation, and\nthus came to believe that it was a prototype or a proof-of-concept. Whatever it was, when its\nauthors were done, they apparently wiped a drop of sweat off their brow and said, “we’re not\ndoing that again”.\n\n\n-----\n\nScreenshot of the IRC channel used to control Linux.Backdoor.IRC.

This group is thought to have\n[been behind the high-profile NotPetya outbreak, as well as several attacks against critical](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\ninfrastructure in Ukraine (which were dressed up as ransomware attacks with a highly\nunreasonable ransom demand). The group is thought to have connections with the\nBlackEnergy group, which was known for a similar modus operandi; the name “Telebots” is\nderived from its standard backdoor tool, which communicates with its C&C server via the\nTelegram bot API.\n\n\n-----\n\nA part of the Exaramel backdoor disassembly.

It was also bundled\nwith an embedded credential stealer, which harvested passwords from a long list of web\nbrowsers and FTP clients.\n\nWe finally note that versions of this backdoor were spotted in the wild that were compiled to\nrun on Linux OS, which implies that the Telebots group makes a point of being a crossplatform threat. This at least may explain why they rewrote their backdoor in a “modern C++\nreplacement” language. Outside of Rust and Golang’s 3 party code ecosystems, to retargetrd\nyour executable you’d either have to rely on a VM/interpreter at the victim end, or else go\nback and individually change OS API calls. As to why this group didn’t rewrite the backdoor\nin Golang instead, it is a mystery for the ages. Maybe they just really like generics.\n\n**Other Honorable mentions**\n\n[Linux.Grip (2005) reportedly used a snippet of the esoteric language Brainf*ck for](https://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck)\ngenerating encryption keys.\n[Retefe (2013), a banking Trojan, has a history of unorthodox clones meant for non-](https://www.govcert.admin.ch/blog/33/the-retefe-saga)\nWindows operating systems — including a clone written in Apple’s Objective-C, which\nwas distributed circa April 2017 in a campaign that targeted the key demographic of\nSwiss macOS users.\n[Gootkit (2014), also a banking Trojan, is written mostly in Javascript (Node.js), a](https://www.certego.net/en/news/malware-tales-gootkit/)\nlanguage usually reserved for web development.\n\n\n-----\n\n[LatentBot (2017), an all-purpose modular backdoor, as well as several packers that](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/06/latentbot/)\n[have been spotted in the wild, were written in Delphi — a dialect of Pascal, a language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language))\ninvented in 1970 for educational purposes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs you’ve probably heard, the malware landscape is in constant evolution. Most actors just\ncopy what’s known to work, but some like to experiment — whether due to an actual need or\nsheer hipster spirit. The failures are then discarded as dead ends, while the successes are\nimitated. Some technologies are esoteric right now because they genuinely aren’t a good fit\nfor writing malware; others, because they haven’t picked up credibility, or because threat\nactors shy away from their slightly different mix of pros and cons, and would rather deal with\nthe devil they know.\n\nIt’s difficult to say in advance which of these technologies, if any, will become the “next big\nthing” in the malware world. Some technologies, such as Golang and Powershell, seem\nparticularly well-poised to do so (Powershell is already halfway there). Others, like Java and\nRust, not so much. But for a technology to become fashionable in the cybercrime circles, all\nit takes is one ambitious author to produce one high-profile successful campaign that hinges\non it.\n\nWill we all still be looking at C malware all day long 10 years from now? 20? It’s difficult to\nknow. But maybe we should hope so. The current malware landscape, which is enough of a\nproblem, came to be even as threat actors duly spent a bulk of their resources debugging\nsegmentation faults, looking up function parameter order in the MSDN database and copypasting code from header to source files and back again. Maybe we don’t want to find out\nwhat happens when all of that time suddenly becomes free time.\n\n\n-----",
