BUZZDIRECTION is another modular rootkit, but more extensive\nthan BLATSTING. [This list classifies it as “a firewall software implant for Fortigate firewalls”,](https://musalbas.com/2016/08/16/equation-group-firewall-operations-catalogue.html)\njust like BLATSTING. Maybe it is just a successor for the same purpose, but maybe it is\nsomething more.\n\nThere is clear evidence that it is a newer and improved version of the same software:\n\nThe terms LP and Implant are used in the same way, for the controlling and victim site\nrespectively. Both the LP side and the implant side have loadable code modules with a\ndependency hierarchy.\n\nThere are approximately the same modules, and they are named similarly.\n\nBoth use an ELF-based loading system (Executable-and-Loading Format is a standard\nformat used for executables by many operating systems and compiler toolchain)\n\n[Both use the same obfuscation method for strings.](https://gist.github.com/laanwj/9e5e404266a8956beabde522f97c421b#file-blatsting-txt-L526)\n\nHowever, BUZZDIRECTION adds some new features:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n ╔ ╗     ╔ ╗      ╔ ╗\n ║ Implant     ║     ║ LP-backend  ║      ║ LP-frontend ║\n ╟─────────────────╢  C&C  ╟──────────────╢      ╟──────────────╢\n ║ ┌─────────────┐ ║ Network ║ ┌──────────┐ ║      ║       ║\n ║ │ App mods  │<╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌>│ Mod1   │ ║ Usually  ║  UI driver ║\n ║ └─────────────┘ ║     ║ └──────────┘ ║ localhost ║       ║\n ║ ┌─────────────┐ ║     ║ ┌──────────┐ ║<╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌>║       ║\n ║ │ Base mods  │<╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌>│ Mod2   │ ║      ║  ...    ║\n ║ └─────────────┘ ║     ║ └──────────┘ ║      ║       ║\n ║ ┌─────────────┐ ║     ║ ┌──────────┐ ║      ║       ║\n ║ │ Plat. mods │ ║     ║ │ ...   │ ║      ║       ║\n ║ └─────────────┘ ║     ║ └──────────┘ ║      ║       ║\n ╚═════════════════╝     ╚══════════════╝      ╚══════════════╝\n\n```\nPlatform-dependent and -independent modules.\n\nTwo platforms are included: BUZZTACO and BUZZFAJITA. It is not clear to me\nwhat these are exactly, but they are both based on Linux, supposedly Linuxbased routers. This software seems less specifically targetted than BLATSTING\nwhich was hardcoded to specific kernels. It is also much easier to add support for\nnew targets here.\nMultiple CPU architecture support: `i386` `ppc` `x86_64 are those included.`\n\nEven more care has been taken to purge / obfuscate strings.\n\nThere is a better organized directory hierarchy. Modules are split between base\n(Crypto, Hash, core utilities), base platform (platform functions for accessing files,\nprocesses, persistence, and so on), and application (NetworkProfiler, SecondDate,\nTunnel, and so on).\n\nThe LP has been split into two parts: an binary backend and a Python-based frontend.\nThe frontend sends commands to the backend, which in turn sends them to the\nimplant. This supposedly allows some more flexibility in separating functions over\ndifferent networks, as well as being easier for automation.\n\nAn XML-based description format is used to describe the modules and their\nparameters and dependencies on the LP side.\n\nThe smell of industrialization of these kind of operations is clear from this progression. By\nmaking it easier to configure, easier to retarget, and easier to automate, it is cheaper to do\nmore of it. If this trend continued by now there will be a sprawling ecosystem of surveillance\nmodules, like a NSA appstore, which are habitually used on every router in sight.\n\nAnother name that is used for supposedly this malware is BUZZLIGHTYEAR (from\n```\n Firewall/OPS/userscript.FW ).\n\n```\nWritten on September 11, 2016\n\n[Tags: eqgrp malware](https://laanwj.github.io/tags/#eqgrp)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Filed under Reverse-engineering](https://laanwj.github.io/categories/#reverse-engineering)\n\n\n-----",
