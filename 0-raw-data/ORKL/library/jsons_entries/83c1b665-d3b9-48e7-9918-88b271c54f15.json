    "plain_text": "# China-based Cyber Threat Group Uses Dropbox for Malware Communications and Targets Hong Kong Media Outlets\n\n**[fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/11/china-based-threat.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/11/china-based-threat.html)**\n\nThreat Research\n\nFireEye Threat Intelligence\n\nDec 01, 2015\n\n8 mins read\n\nMalware\n\nFireEye Threat Intelligence analysts identified a spear phishing campaign carried out in\nAugust 2015 targeting Hong Kong-based media organizations. A China-based cyber threat\ngroup, which FireEye tracks as an uncategorized advanced persistent threat (APT) group\n\n\n-----\n\nand other researchers refer to as admin@338, may have conducted the activity.[1] The\nemail messages contained malicious documents with a malware payload called LOWBALL.\nLOWBALL abuses the Dropbox cloud storage service for command and control (CnC). We\ncollaborated with Dropbox to investigate the threat, and our cooperation revealed what may\nbe a second, similar operation. The attack is part of a trend where threat groups hide\nmalicious activity by communicating with legitimate web services such as social networking\nand cloud storage sites to foil detection efforts.[2][3]\n\n## A Cyber Campaign Likely Intended to Monitor Hong Kong Media During a Period of Crisis\n\nThe threat group has previously used newsworthy events as lures to deliver malware.[4]\nThey have largely targeted organizations involved in financial, economic and trade policy,\ntypically using publicly available RATs such as Poison Ivy, as well some non-public\nbackdoors.[5]\n\nThe group started targeting Hong Kong media companies, probably in response to political\nand economic challenges in Hong Kong and China. The threat group’s latest activity\ncoincided with the announcement of criminal charges against democracy activists.[6] During\nthe past 12 months, Chinese authorities have faced several challenges, including large-scale\nprotests in Hong Kong in late 2014, the precipitous decline in the stock market in mid-2015,\nand the massive industrial explosion in Tianjin in August 2015. In Hong Kong, the prodemocracy movement persists, and the government recently denied a professor a post\nbecause of his links to a pro-democracy leader.[7]\n\nMultiple China-based cyber threat groups have targeted international media organizations in\nthe past. The targeting has often focused on Hong Kong-based media, particularly those that\npublish pro-democracy material. The media organizations targeted with the threat group’s\nwell-crafted Chinese language lure documents are precisely those whose networks Beijing\nwould seek to monitor. Cyber threat groups’ access to the media organization’s networks\ncould potentially provide the government advance warning on upcoming protests, information\non pro-democracy group leaders, and insights needed to disrupt activity on the Internet, such\nas what occurred in mid-2014 when several websites were brought down in denial of service\nattacks.[8]\n\n## Threat Actors Use Spear Phishing Written in Traditional Chinese Script in Attempted Intrusions\n\nIn August 2015, the threat actors sent spear phishing emails to a number of Hong Kongbased media organizations, including newspapers, radio, and television. The first email\nreferences the creation of a Christian civil society organization to coincide with the\nanniversary of the 2014 protests in Hong Kong known as the Umbrella Movement. The\nsecond email references a Hong Kong University alumni organization that fears votes in a\nreferendum to appoint a Vice-Chancellor will be co-opted by pro-Beijing interests.[9]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Lure screenshots\n\n\nThe group’s previous activities against financial and policy organizations have largely\nfocused on spear phishing emails written in English, destined for Western audiences. This\ncampaign, however, is clearly designed for those who read the traditional Chinese script\ncommonly used in Hong Kong.\n\n## LOWBALL Malware Analysis\n\nThe spear phishing emails contained three attachments in total, each of which exploited an\nolder vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2012-0158):\n\nMD5 Filename\n\nb9208a5b0504cb2283b1144fc455eaaa 使命公民運動 我們的異象.doc\n\n\n-----\n\nec19ed7cddf92984906325da59f75351 新聞稿及公佈.doc\n\n6495b384748188188d09e9d5a0c401a4 (代發)[采訪通知]港大校友關注組遞信行動.doc\n\nIn all three cases, the payload was the same:\n\nMD5 Filename\n\nd76261ba3b624933a6ebb5dd73758db4 time.exe\n\nThis backdoor, known as LOWBALL, uses the legitimate Dropbox cloud-storage\n\nservice to act as the CnC server. It uses the Dropbox API with a hardcoded bearer access\ntoken and has the ability to download, upload, and execute files. The communication occurs\nvia HTTPS over port 443.\n\nAfter execution, the malware will use the Dropbox API to make an HTTP GET request using\nHTTPS over TCP port 443 for the files:\n\nMD5 Filename\n\nd76261ba3b624933a6ebb5dd73758db4 WmiApCom\n\n79b68cdd0044edd4fbf8067b22878644 WmiApCom.bat\n\nThe “WmiApCom.bat” file is simply used to start “WmiApCom”, which happens to be the\nexact same file as the one dropped by the malicious Word documents. However, this is most\nlikely meant to be a mechanism to update the compromised host with a new version of the\nLOWBALL malware.\n\nThe threat group monitors its Dropbox account for responses from compromised computers.\nOnce the LOWBALL malware calls back to the Dropbox account, the attackers will create a\nfile called “[COMPUTER_NAME]_upload.bat” which contains commands to be executed on\nthe compromised computer. This batch file is then executed on the target computer, with the\nresults uploaded to the attackers’ Dropbox account in a file named\n“[COMPUTER_NAME]_download”.\n\nWe observed the threat group issue the following commands:\n\n\n-----\n\n@echo off\n\ndir c:\\ >> %temp%\\download\n\nipconfig /all >> %temp%\\download\n\nnet user >> %temp%\\download\n\nnet user /domain >> %temp%\\download\n\nver >> %temp%\\download\n\ndel %0\n\n@echo off\n\ndir \"c:\\Documents and Settings\" >> %temp%\\download\n\ndir \"c:\\Program Files\\\n\n\" >> %temp%\\download\n\nnet start >> %temp%\\download\n\nnet localgroup administrator >> %temp%\\download\n\nnetstat -ano >> %temp%\\download\n\nThese commands allow the threat group to gain information about the compromised\ncomputer and the network to which it belongs. Using this information, they can decide to\nexplore further or instruct the compromised computer to download additional malware.\n\nWe observed the threat group upload a second stage malware, known as BUBBLEWRAP\n(also known as Backdoor.APT.FakeWinHTTPHelper) to their Dropbox account along with the\nfollowing command:\n\n@echo off\n\n\n-----\n\nren \"%temp%\\upload\" audiodg.exe\n\nstart %temp%\\audiodg.exe\n\ndir d:\\ >> %temp%\\download\n\nsysteminfo >> %temp%\\download\n\ndel %0\n\nWe have previously observed the admin@338 group use BUBBLEWRAP. This particular\nsample connected to the CnC domain accounts.serveftp[.]com, which resolved to an IP\naddress previously used by the threat group, although the IP had not been used for some\ntime prior to this most recent activity:\n\nMD5\n\n0beb957923df2c885d29a9c1743dd94b accounts.serveftp.com 59.188.0.197\n\nBUBBLEWRAP is a full-featured backdoor that is set to run when the system boots, and can\ncommunicate using HTTP, HTTPS, or a SOCKS proxy. This backdoor collects system\ninformation, including the operating system version and hostname, and includes functionality\nto check, upload, and register plugins that can further enhance its capabilities.\n\n## A Second Operation\n\nFireEye works closely with security researchers and industry partners to mitigate cyber\nthreats, and we collaborated with Dropbox to respond to this activity. The Dropbox security\nteam was able to identify this abuse and put countermeasures in place.\n\nOur cooperation uncovered what appears to be a second, ongoing operation, though we lack\nsufficient evidence to verify if admin@338 is behind it. The attack lifecycle followed the same\npattern, though some of the filenames were different, which indicates that there may be\nmultiple versions of the malware. In addition, while the operation targeting Hong Kong-based\nmedia involved a smaller number of targets and a limited duration, we suspect this second\noperation involves up to 50 targets. At this time, we are unable to identify the victims.\n\nIn this case, after the payload is delivered via an exploit the threat actor places files (named\nupload.bat, upload.rar, and period.txt, download.txt or silent.txt) in a directory on a Dropbox\naccount. The malware beacons to this directory using the hardcoded API token and attempts\n\n\n-----\n\nto download these files (which are deleted from the Dropbox account after the download):\n\nupload.bat, a batch script that the compromised machine will execute\nupload.rar, a RAR archive that contains at least two files: a batch script to execute, and\noften an executable (sometimes named rar.exe) which the batch script will run and\nalmost always uploads the results of download.rar to the cloud storage account\nsilent.txt and period.txt, small files sizes of 0-4 bytes that dictate the frequency to\ncheck in with the CnC\n\nThe threat actor will then download the results and then delete the files from the cloud\nstorage account.\n\nConclusion\n\nLOWBALL is an example of malware that abuses cloud storage services to mask its activity\nfrom network defenders. The LOWBALL first stage malware allows the group to collect\ninformation from victims and then deliver the BUBBLEWRAP second stage malware to their\nvictims after verifying that they are indeed interesting targets.\n\n_[A version of this article appeared first on the FireEye Intelligence Center.
