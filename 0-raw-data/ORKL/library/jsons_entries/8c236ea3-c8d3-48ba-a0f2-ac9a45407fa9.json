    "plain_text": "# FSB NKTsKI: Foreign ‘cyber mercenaries’ breached Russian federal agencies\n\n**[therecord.media/fsb-nktski-foreign-cyber-mercenaries-breached-russian-federal-agencies/](https://therecord.media/fsb-nktski-foreign-cyber-mercenaries-breached-russian-federal-agencies/)**\n\nMay 21, 2021\n\nForeign hackers have breached and stolen information from Russian federal executive\nbodies, the Russian government said in a report published last week.\n\nThe attacks were identified in 2020.\n\nThey were detailed in a joint report authored by Rostelecom-Solar, a cybersecurity division of\nRussian telecom giant Rostelecom, and the National Coordination Center for Computer\nIncidents (NKTsKI), a CERT-like organization created by the Russian Federal Security\nService (FSB) in 2018.\n\n“Evaluating attackers in terms of training and qualifications (used technologies and\nmechanisms, the speed and quality of the work done by them), we are inclined to classify\nthis group as cyber mercenaries pursuing the interests of a foreign state,” the report\nreads.\n\n## Attackers used novel malware\n\n\n-----\n\nTo breach Russian federal agencies, Rostelecom and NKTsKI said the attackers used a\nbroad set of entry vectors that included spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities in web\napplications, and hacking the IT infrastructure of government contractors.\n\n“After a complete compromise of the infrastructure, the attackers proceeded to collect\nconfidential information from all sources of interest: such as mail servers, electronic\ndocument management servers, file servers, and workstations of various levels,” the report\nsaid.\n\nOnce they breached a victim, the attackers would deploy two never-before-seen malware\nstrains named Mail-O and Webdav-O, both stealthy backdoors that the intruders used to\nexecute commands on infected hosts and steal data.\n\nBoth strains exfiltrated data to command and control infrastructure hosted on local Russian\ncloud providers, with Mail-O uploading data to Mail.ru Cloud servers and Webdav-O to the\nYandex.Disk cloud.\n\nBoth Mail-O and Webdav-O were also designed to bypass Kaspersky antivirus software,\nwhich is usually installed on Russian federal networks, and disguised their network traffic as\nlegitimate communications for Mail.ru’s Disk-O and the Yandex.Disk applications.\n\nThe [joint report contains additional technical details about the inner workings of both](https://rt-solar.ru/analytics/reports/2203/)\nmalware strains.\n\nRussian authorities did not attribute the attack to any specific country as of yet.\n\nThe report comes a month after the US government formally attributed the SolarWinds\nsupply-chain attack to a cyber-espionage operation carried out by the Russian Foreign\nIntelligence Service.\n\nTags\n\n[APT](https://therecord.media/tag/apt/)\n[FSB](https://therecord.media/tag/fsb/)\n[Mail.ru](https://therecord.media/tag/mail-ru/)\n[nation-state](https://therecord.media/tag/nation-state-2/)\n[NKTsKI](https://therecord.media/tag/nktski/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n[Yandex](https://therecord.media/tag/yandex/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
