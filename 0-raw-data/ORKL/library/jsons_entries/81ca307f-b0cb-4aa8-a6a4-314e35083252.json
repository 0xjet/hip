Reasons for Taiwan being targeted range from being one of the**\n**sovereign states of the disputed South China Sea region to its emerging economy and growth with Taiwan being one of the most innovative countries in**\n**the High-Tech industry in Asia.**\n\n**In early August, Unit 42 identified two attacks using similar techniques. The more interesting one was a targeted attack towards the Secretary General of�**\n**Taiwan’s Government office – Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has several individual boards which are formed to enforce different executing�**\n**functions of the government. The Executive Yuan Council evaluates statutory and budgetary bills and bills concerning martial law, amnesty, declaration**\n**of war, conclusion of peace and treaties, and other important affairs. Given the important functions undertaken by the Executive Yuan office, it is not a�**\n**surprise that they were targeted. The second attack was against an energy sector company also located in Taiwan.**\n\n**[The attacks in this case are associated with a campaign called Tropic Trooper, which has been active since at least 2011 and is known for heavily](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf)**\n**targeting Taiwan. One of the attacks used their known Yahoyah malware, but the other attack deployed the widely available Poison Ivy RAT. This**\n**confirms the actors are using Poison Ivy as part of their toolkit, something speculated in the original Trend Micro report but not confirmed by them.�**\n**Further analysis uncovered a handful of ties indicating the actors may also be using the PCShare malware family, which has not been previously tied to**\n**the group.**\n\n**Figure 1 shows the spear phishing email which was sent to the Secretary General of Executive Yuan. The email is spoofed so that it appears as though it**\n**was sent from a staff member at the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).�**\n\n**_Figure 1. Spear-phishing email with malicious attachment._**\n\n**The document attached to this e-mail exploits CVE-2012-0158, a Microsoft Office vulnerability. This process is described in the Malware Analysis�**\n**section later in this report, but one interesting aspect of this malicious was the decoy document the attacker chose to deploy.**\n\n## Decoy Document\n\n**As we have noted in many earlier reports, attackers commonly use decoy files to trick victims into thinking a malicious document is actually legitimate.�**\n**After infecting the computer, the display a clean document to the victim that contains content that is relevant to them.**\n\n**The decoy document used in this case is a spreadsheet with four tabs, respectively titled “example,” “0720,” “0721,” and “1041109 full update”. All of**\n**the text uses Traditional Chinese, in contrast to Simplified Chinese, which is the official written language of the People’s Republic of China. Traditional�**\n**Chinese is used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and many overseas Chinese communities. The overarching theme of the spreadsheet is documenting**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2. The four tabs in the decoy spreadsheet._**\n\n**The “example” spreadsheet tab is exactly as described – it contains the headers and suggested information within two of the remaining three tabs. The**\n**headers themselves translate, from left to right, to “responsible department,” “issue,” “developments this week,” “political situation judgment,” and**\n**“related information.” The tab labeled 0721 only has the matching headers and no additional information. None of the information in the spreadsheet**\n**relates to activities past 2015, and there are references made to the then upcoming January 16, 2016 elections in Taiwan. In that election the DPP won,**\n**displacing the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for only the second time in history, and with Taiwan’s first female President.�**\n\n**The spreadsheet labeled 0720 refers to the Anti-Black Box Movement, which was a protest by Taiwanese high school students against certain proposed**\n**curriculum changes. The use of “black box” by the protestors is in reference to former Taiwanese President Ma Ying-Jeou’s government and its lack of**\n**transparency concerning government decisions. Protestors occupied Taiwan’s Ministry of Education last July. A resolution passed by Taiwan’s legislature**\n**and approved by the Executive Yuan in May of this year delayed implementing that curriculum until 2020 to allow time for the act to be amended.**\n\n**The Anti-Black Box Movement is related to the Sunflower Student Movement, a coalition of both student groups and other civic organizations that�**\n**protested the Cross-Strait Trade Agreement between Taiwan and the PRC, feeling it would hurt Taiwan’s economy and increase the PRC’s sway over the**\n**island. On March 17 2014, the KMT, the ruling party at the time, tried to force a vote without a previously agreed clause by clause review with the DPP.**\n**The following evening protesters occupied the Legislative Yuan, the first time that had occurred Taiwan’s history. On March 23 of the same year, after�**\n**then President Ma re-affirmed he supported the pact and would not alter or drop it, protestors occupied the Executive Yuan where over 150 were injured�**\n**and 61 arrested.**\n\n**The final tab contains the most information of the three and has different headers. From left to right, the headers are titled “responsible person(s),”�**\n**“summary of issues and major groups,” “crisis simulation, political judgment, and recommendations,” “degree of tension,” and “participating members.”**\n\n**Information related to the November 2015 “Autumn Struggle” protest, which is an annual protest first done in 2013.�**\n**Information on a Taichung City government development proposal being protested largely on environmental impact grounds, and protestor**\n**demands.**\n**Army 1 Special Forces veterans attempt to receive compensation for alleged illegal extension of forced military servicest**\n**The recently settled case where toll workers forced into unemployment by the Taiwanese government’s agreement with the Far Eastern Electronic**\n**Toll Collection Company to create a national electronic toll collection system ended up resulting in the 2013 layoffs of hundreds, who have since�**\n**protested for new jobs as well as lost severance and pension.**\n**Kaohsiung refinery closing and protestor demands, also largely related to environmental effects and necessary cleanup; the refinery officially closed�**\n**at the end of December 2015**\n**Closely watching any trade agreements between the Malaysian government and Taiwan**\n**Potential environmental and current residential issues related to the development of the Aerotropolis around Taoyuan International Airport, which is**\n**intended to create a major transportation hub and industry center for Asia with infrastructure for corporate research and development, conference**\n**centers, and other facilities.**\n**The Puyu Development Plan, which is part of Taiwan’s Knowledge-based Economy plan**\n**Taiwan’s 12-year compulsory education plan**\n**Anti-Black Box Movement demands and recent activity**\n**Improving working conditions for Taiwanese firefighters�**\n**Pension reforms**\n**The Nest Movement, which started in 2014 and is related to the older “Shell-less Snail Movement,” focused on affordable housing, neighborhood�**\n**and urban development, ending forced demolition and relocation, property tax reform, and related housing issues**\n**The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) voted on by the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) for the Dongshi-Fengyuan Expressway, part**\n**of the National Highway #4 Project and anti-eviction efforts�**\n**Kaohsiung water quality issues and related projects**\n**Same sex marriage legalization**\n**Protecting old trees in Kaohsiung amidst construction for a new “green” library; most of the designated “precious trees” are rare exotic species**\n**Indigenous peoples in Kaohsiung land return**\n**Activities against the Miramar Resort Village, including the revocation of the EIA, forcing development to halt**\n**Lowering the voting age in Taiwan from 20 to 18**\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\n**[The documents attached to spear-phishing e-mails used in both attacks contain code that exploits CVE-2012-0158, which despite its age remains one](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical papers/CVE-2012-0158-An-Anatomy-of-a-Prolific-Exploit.PDF)**\n**of the most common Microsoft Word vulnerabilities being exploited by multiple threat actors. This matches with known Tactics, Techniques, and**\n**Procedures (TTPs) for Tropic Trooper, targeting both government institutions and also the energy industry in Taiwan.**\n\n**The delivery document uses the XLSX extension typically used by OpenXML documents, but the file itself is actually an OLE (XLS) document. The file�**\n**extension to file type discrepancy was caused by the actor using Excel’s built-in encryption capability, which stores XLSX ciphertext and the information�**\n**needed for decryption in an OLE document.**\n\n**Filename: 進步[議題⼯作圈議題控管表].xlsx**\n**MD5: a89b1ce793f41f3c35396b054dbdb749**\n**SHA1: f45e2342e40100b770d73dd06f5d9b79bfce4a72**\n**SHA256: 2baa76c9aa3834548d82a36e150d329e3268417b3f12b8f72d209d51bbacf671**\n**Type: CDF V2 Document, No summary info**\n**Size: 327128 bytes**\n\n**_Table 1. Details of the malicious document attached to the e-mail._**\n\n**The embedded shellcode enumerates open handles for a file with a size greater than 0xa6f0 (Decimal – 42736) bytes. It will then set the file pointer to�**\n**0xa6e8 (Decimal – 42728) and starts looking for the following delimiter:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**DWORD of ciphertext at a time with 0x29f7c592. The resulting cleartext is a second piece of shellcode that continues carrying out further functionality.**\n\n**The secondary shellcode starts by resolving the following API functions using a ROT13 hashing algorithm:**\n\n**kernel32.dll!CreateFileA**\n**kernel32.dll!ReadFile**\n**kernel32.dll!WriteFile**\n**kernel32.dll!SetFilePointer**\n**kernel32.dll!CopyFileA**\n**kernel32.dll!MoveFileExA**\n**kernel32.dll!CreateToolhelp32Snapshot**\n**kernel32.dll!Process32Next**\n**kernel32.dll!CloseHandle**\n**kernel32.dll!VirtualAlloc**\n**kernel32.dll!WinExec**\n**kernel32.dll!TerminateProcess**\n**kernel32.dll!LoadLibraryA**\n**kernel32.dll!lstrlenA**\n**kernel32.dll!lstrcpyA**\n**kernel32.dll!lstrcatA**\n**kernel32.dll!GetTempPathA**\n**kernel32.dll!WideCharToMultiByte**\n**kernel32.dll!QueryDosDeviceA**\n**ntdll.dll!NtQueryObject**\n**advapi32.dll!RegOpenKeyA**\n**advapi32.dll!RegSetValueExA**\n**advapi32.dll!RegCloseKey**\n\n**Immediately following these API functions there are three DWORDS; one used to locate the payload embedded within the exploit file, one for the size of�**\n**the payload, and one for the size of decoy document. The two size values are added together to get the length of the ciphertext that the shellcode will**\n**decrypt. In the sample we analyzed, the following values were present, showing that the payload is at offset 0xabc0 and has a size of 0x45218:�**\n\n**DWORD offset_toPayload; (0ABC0h)�**\n**DWORD payload_Size; (1C600h)**\n**DWORD decoy_Size; (28C18h)**\n\n**The shellcode then creates a string that it uses to create a registry key to automatically run the final payload each time the system starts. It then opens�**\n**the registry key ‘Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon’ and sets the value to the “Shell” subkey to the previously created string.**\n**Ultimately, the following registry key is created for persistence:**\n\n**HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell:**\n**“explorer.exe,rundll32.exe “C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application**\n**Data\\Identities\\Identities.ocx” SSSS”**\n\n**It then uses the “offset_toPayload” value as an offset that it will read 283160 (45218h) bytes from the XLS file. The shellcode then enters a decryption�**\n**loop to convert the embedded payload from ciphertext to cleartext. The algorithm uses the length of the ciphertext negated as the initial encryption key,**\n**which it bit rotates right by 1 to adjust the key for each of decryption. It will use this key to decrypt four bytes of the ciphertext with the XOR operation**\n**until all the ciphertext is decrypted. During each iteration of the decryption process, the algorithm will check to make sure the four bytes of ciphertext are**\n**not equal to the key or equal to zero before decrypting the ciphertext.

The complete list of indicators on the graph**\n**can also be found in the appendix section of this report.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5 Maltego graph of Tropic Trooper infrastructure_**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The Tropic Trooper threat actor group has been known to target governments and organizations in the Asia Pacific region for at least six years. In�**\n**addition to using Yahoyah malware, we were able to confirm they are also using Poison Ivy and possibly PCShare malware families. They are also still�**\n**exploiting CVE 2012-0158, as are many threat actors. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from Tropic Trooper’s malicious activities by:**\n\n**WildFire correctly identifies all related malware as malicious�**\n**The C2 infrastructure are classified as malicious in PAN-DB�**\n**Traps prevents exploitation of CVE-2012-0158**\n\n**Autofocus customers can discover additional information on Tropic Trooper via the following AutoFocus
