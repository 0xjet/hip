As Cisco Talos revealed, FreakOut operators have also been seen\ndeploying a custom ransomware strain showing that they are actively experimenting with\nnew malicious payloads.\n\nMultiple ransomware gangs, including RansomExx, Babuk Locker, and Darkside, previously\nused VMWare ESXi pre-auth RCE exploits to encrypt virtual hard disks used as centralized\nenterprise storage space.\n\n\"Necro Python bot shows an actor that follows the latest development in remote command\nexecution exploits on various web applications and includes the new exploits into the bot.\nThis increases its chances of spreading and infecting systems,\" Svajcer added.\n\n\n-----\n\nUsers need to make sure to regularly apply the latest security updates to all of the\napplications, not just operating systems.\"\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Microsoft detects massive surge in Linux XorDDoS malware activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-detects-massive-surge-in-linux-xorddos-malware-activity/)\n\n[Qbot malware switches to new Windows Installer infection vector](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-malware-switches-to-new-windows-installer-infection-vector/)\n\n[Malicious PyPI package opens backdoors on Windows, Linux, and Macs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-pypi-package-opens-backdoors-on-windows-linux-and-macs/)\n\n\n-----",
