It claims to have breached 30\norganizations in government, financial services, manufacturing, logistics, consulting,\n\n\n-----\n\nagriculture, healthcare services, insurance agencies, energy and law firms in the United\nStates, United Kingdom and a dozen more countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and\nSouth America.\n\nLike many ransomware gangs, Prometheus runs like a professional enterprise. It refers to its\nvictims as “customers,” communicates with them using a customer service ticketing system\nthat warns them when payment deadlines are approaching and even uses a clock to count\ndown the hours, minutes and seconds to a payment deadline.\n\n“We are closing the ticket and have started an auction on your data,” the group threatens\nwhen victims fail to pay up. But there’s an out: Victims can click to open a new “ticket” if\nthey’re willing to pay up to stop the auction and recover their data.\n\nOnly four victims have paid to date, according to the group’s leak site. It claims that a\nPeruvian agricultural company, a Brazilian healthcare services provider and transportation\nand logistics organizations in Austria and Singapore paid ransoms. However, we’re unable to\nconfirm the ransom amounts.\n\nOne interesting note is that Prometheus claims to be part of the notorious ransomware gang\n[REvil. Unit 42 has seen no indication that these two ransomware gangs are related in any](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-assessments/7/)\nway. The claim may be an attempt to exploit REvil’s name to persuade victims to pay up, or it\ncould be a false flag to take attention away from Thanos.\n\nWe’ve compiled this report to shed light into the threat posed by the emergence of new\nransomware gangs like Prometheus, which are able to quickly scale up new operations by\nembracing the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, in which they procure ransomware\ncode, infrastructure and access to compromised networks from outside providers. The RaaS\nmodel has lowered the barrier to entry for ransomware gangs.\n\nFull visualization of the Prometheus techniques observed and the courses of action relevant\n[for response can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM Viewer.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/)\n\nIf you think you may have been impacted, please email unit42investigations@paloaltonetworks.com or call (855) 875-4631 to get in touch with the Unit 42\nIncident Response team.\n\n## Prometheus Ransomware Overview\n\nPrometheus ransomware was first observed in February 2021 and is a new variant of a\n[known strain called Thanos. Thanos ransomware has been advertised for sale on](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/thanos-ransomware/)\n[underground forums since at least the first half of 2020, where it has a builder that allows](https://www.recordedfuture.com/thanos-ransomware-builder/)\nactors to customize a sample with a wide variety of available settings. This suggests that\ndifferent threat actors may have leveraged this builder to create their own variants and\nbrands.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, we turn our attention to one of those threat actors, Prometheus. While this\nransomware gang claims to be part of REvil, we haven’t seen any other solid connection\nbetween the two groups. REvil operates on an affiliate-driven RaaS program, but we believe\nthe Prometheus ransomware gang may be acting on their own and attempting to leverage\nthe infamous REvil name and reputation to improve the chance that victims will pay the\ndemanded ransom. This would not be the first time adversaries have used the names of\n[well-known threat groups to strengthen their credibility.](https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2019/11/fake-cozy-bear-group-making-ddos-extortion-demands.html)\n\nAt the time of writing, we don’t have information on how Prometheus ransomware is being\ndelivered, but threat actors are known for buying access to certain networks, brute-forcing\ncredentials or spear phishing for initial access.\n\nWhen Prometheus ransomware is executed, it tries to kill several backups and security\n[software-related processes, such as Raccine, a ransomware prevention tool that tries to stop](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Raccine)\nransomware from deleting shadow copies in Windows. Here is a sample of its approach:\n\nPrometheus ransomware appends an extension using the following format .[XXX-XXXXXXX] (Figure 1). We found that the extensions are hardcoded into the sample. We believe\nthat the Prometheus ransomware operators generate a unique payload per victim, which is\nused for their negotiation site to recover files. We obfuscated the extensions because they\ncould be used to identify the victims on the leak site. Prometheus also adds an hexadecimal\nstring of GotAllDone at the end of all encrypted files.\n\nFigure 1. Encrypted files after execution.\nAfter the backup and security processes are terminated and encryption is complete,\nPrometheus ransomware drops two ransom notes: a RESTORE_FILES_INFO.TXT file and a\nRESTORE_FILES_INFO.TXT.hta file (Figure 2), both containing the same information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta.\nThe ransom note also includes instructions for contacting Prometheus ransomware\noperators to recover files, as well as informing the victim that, if the demands are not met,\nthe threat actors will release the data to the public or sell it to a third party.\n\nSince the extensions are used as a victim identifier, by following the instructions on the\nransom note, we were able to take a look at the negotiation part of their site using the\nextensions ID to gain access. Interestingly, this group uses a ticketing system for tracking\nvictims. The tickets include a tracking ID, created date, resolution status and priority. A victim\ncan even open a ticket with the threat actors to request data recovery – though this will cost\nyou extra, according to the site (Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Prometheus reply to a victim ticket.\nThe Prometheus ransomware gang tailors their ransom demand depending on the victim\norganization. From the available instances observed, we have seen payments requested as\nlow as $6,000 and as high as $100,000 in Monero (XMR). This price is doubled if the victims\ndon’t contact the threat actors within the established timeframe, which on average is a week.\nAt the time of writing, four victims paid the ransom including a Peru-based agricultural\ncompany, a healthcare services provider in Brazil, and two transportation and logistics\norganizations – one located in Austria and the other in Singapore.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Prometheus victim ticket.\n\nLike many current ransomware gangs, this group also created a leak site (a different section\nof the same website that hosts the “ticketing system”) where they name and shame their\nvictims (Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Prometheus leak site.\n\nThe Prometheus ransomware operators include a status per victim. We found that some of\nthe information posted on the leak site has already been sold to an unknown third party.\nThere are also posts showing that victims within impacted industries paid the ransom and\ntheir data was removed from the site (Figure 6).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Leak site victim status for Prometheus ransomware out of 30 victims.\n\n## Prometheus Victimology\n\nAt the time of this writing, the Prometheus leak site hosts 30 victims, impacting multiple\nindustries globally. By taking a look at their victims listed, we generated this graph, showing\nthe locations of organizations impacted by this ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Countries impacted by Prometheus ransomware out of 30 victims.\nManufacturing was the most impacted industry among the victim organizations we observed,\nclosely followed by the transportation and logistics industry.\n\nFigure 8. Industries impacted by Prometheus ransomware out of 30 victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Older Prometheus Variants\n\nThe first encountered Prometheus sample, first observed in February 2021 (SHA256:\n9bf0633f41d2962ba5e2895ece2ef9fa7b546ada311ca30f330f0d261a7fb184), behaves\nsimilarly to the more recent variant we are currently tracking. However, it appends the\nfollowing extension to the encrypted files: .PROM[prometheushelp@mail[.]ch].\n\nSome of the observed samples, when executed, opened a Windows Command Shell\nshowing the encryption progress (Figure 9). The most recent Prometheus samples do not\ndisplay this information.\n\nFigure 9. Encryption progress window.\nAnother variant (SHA256:\n11aebdff8c064c160c2b21f3a844bacaecd581d9dc2e4224d31903d2a56e2dd3) appended the\n.XXXXXXXXXX[prometheusdec@yahoo[.]com] extension format to encrypted files where the\nX is the victim ID. Like the current variant, it generates two ransom note files. The ransom\nnote includes two ways to contact the group that are different from those offered by the\ncurrent variant (Figure 10). Based on the content and instructions provided by this variant,\nwe believe Prometheus didn’t have a leak site established at the time they distributed it.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta (as sent by an older Prometheus variant).\nInstead of directing the victim to the leak site as the current variant does, the older variant of\nPrometheus instructs the victim to go to a Tor site called Sonar, a web-based messaging\nservice, and create an account. After the account is created, the ransom note instructs the\n\n\n-----\n\nvictim to send a message to the username Prometheus, containing the file extension\nidentifier and a link to three encrypted files to provide proof of decryption. The second\nmethod of contact is through email and includes three email addresses for contact,\nrequesting the same information as the first method.\n\nThis helps us understand how the Prometheus ransomware group originally operated and\nshows the evolution of their approach to securing payment before deciding to start their own\nleak site.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPrometheus is a new and emerging ransomware gang that uses a personalized variant of\nThanos ransomware. The operators behind this ransomware are actively targeting multiple\nindustries globally. Like many other ransomware groups, Prometheus hosts a leak site to\ncreate additional pressure and shame victims into paying the ransom. While Prometheus\nclaims to be part of the REvil ransomware gang, during our research, we didn’t find a solid\nconnection between the two ransomware groups at the time of writing this report.\n\n[Indicators associated with this Threat Assessment are available on GitHub, have been](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs)\n[published to the Unit 42 TAXII feed and are viewable via the ATOM Viewer.](https://stix2.unit42.org/)\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat by:\n\n[WildFire: All known samples are identified as malware.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire)\n[Cortex XDR with:](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n\nIndicators for Prometheus/Thanos.\nAnti-Ransomware Module to detect Prometheus/Thanos encryption behaviors.\nLocal Analysis detection to detect Prometheus/Thanos binaries.\n[AutoFocus: Tracking related activity using the Thanos tag.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus)\n\nMore information on ransomware can be found in the 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat\nReport.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n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\n\n\n-----\n\nA090bb0e9118d7460c448304ccf47333ea64b90576230b8b4b5dee96f702ecf6\n9bf0633f41d2962ba5e2895ece2ef9fa7b546ada311ca30f330f0d261a7fb184\n779db1c725f71e54d4f31452763784abe783afa6a78cc222e17796b0045f33fc\n\n## Courses of Action\n\nThis section documents relevant tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used with\nPrometheus and maps them directly to Palo Alto Networks product(s) and service(s).
