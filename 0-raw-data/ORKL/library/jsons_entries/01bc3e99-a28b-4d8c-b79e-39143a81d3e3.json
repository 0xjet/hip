Overall the U.S. Government identified and tracked 23 U.S. natural gas pipeline\noperators targeted from 2011 to 2013 in this spearphishing and intrusion campaign. Of the\nknown targeted entities, 13 were confirmed compromises, 3 were near misses, and 8 had an\nunknown depth of intrusion.\n\nThe U.S. Government has attributed this activity to Chinese state-sponsored actors. CISA and\nthe FBI assess that these actors were specifically targeting U.S. pipeline infrastructure for the\npurpose of holding U.S. pipeline infrastructure at risk. Additionally, CISA and the FBI assess that\nthis activity was ultimately intended to help China develop cyberattack capabilities against U.S.\npipelines to physically damage pipelines or disrupt pipeline operations.\n\n_To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact your local FBI field_\n_office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at (855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at CyWatch@fbi.gov._\n_When available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of_\n_activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and_\n_a designated point of contact. To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA_\n_at Central@cisa.gov._\n\n_This document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited.

The TTPs remain relevant to help network defenders protect\nagainst intrusions. The IOCs in table 1 below are provided for historical awareness.\n\nCISA and the FBI urge owners and operators of Energy Sector and other critical infrastructure\n(CI) networks to adopt a heightened state of awareness and implement the recommendations\nlisted in the Mitigations section of this advisory, which include implementing network\nsegmentation between IT and industrial control system (ICS)/operational technology (OT)\nnetworks. These mitigations will improve a CI entity’s defensive cyber posture and functional\nresilience by reducing the risk of compromise or severe operational degradation if the system is\ncompromised by malicious cyber actors, including but not limited to actors associated with the\ncampaign described in this advisory.\n\nFor more information on Chinese malicious cyber activity, see us-cert.cisa.gov/china.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS \n\nIn April 2012, CISA received reports about targeted attacks directed at multiple ONG pipeline\nsites; CISA (via a predecessor organization) and FBI provided incident response and\nremediation support to a number of victims from 2012 to 2013. CISA and FBI’s analysis of the\nmalware and threat actor techniques identified that this activity was related to a spearphishing\ncampaign. The U.S. Government identified and tracked 23 U.S. natural gas pipeline operators\ntargeted in this campaign. Of the 23 known targeted entities, 13 were confirmed compromises, 3\nwere near misses, and 8 had an unknown depth of intrusion.\n\n### Threat Actor Activity\n\nThe spearphishing activity appears to have started in late December 2011. From December 9,\n2011, through at least February 29, 2012, ONG organizations received spearphishing emails\n\n[T1566.002] specifically targeting their employees. The emails were at constructed with a high\nlevel of sophistication to convince employees to view malicious files [T1204.002]. **Note: see the**\nappendix for a table of the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques observed in this campaign.\n\nIn addition to spearphishing, CISA and the FBI were made aware of social engineering attempts\nby malicious actors believed to be associated with this campaign. The apparent goal was to gain\nsensitive information from asset owners [T1598]. One asset owner reported that individuals in\ntheir network engineering department, including managers, received multiple phone calls\nrequesting information about their recent network security practices. Other employees in other\ndepartments were not targeted. The asset owner also reported that these calls began\nimmediately after they had identified and removed the malicious intruder from their network and\nperformed a system-wide credential reset. The caller identified himself as an employee of a large\ncomputer security firm performing a national survey about network cybersecurity practices. He\ninquired about the organization’s policy and practices for firewall use and settings, types of\nsoftware used to protect their network, and the use and type of intrusion detection and/or\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\nprevention systems. The caller was blocking his caller ID and when the targeted organization\ntried to return the call, they reached a number that was not in service.\n\nDuring the investigation of these compromises, CISA and FBI personnel discovered that Chinese\nstate-sponsored actors specifically collected [TA0009] and exfiltrated [TA0010] ICS-related\ninformation. The Chinese state-sponsored actors searched document repositories [T1213] for the\nfollowing data types:\n\n      - Document searches: “SCAD*”\n\n      - Personnel lists\n\n      - Usernames/passwords\n\n      - Dial-up access information\n\n      - System manuals\n\nBased on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also\ncompromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to\ntransfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks. Though designed for\nlegitimate business purposes, these systems have the potential to be manipulated by malicious\ncyber actors if unmitigated. With this access, the Chinese state-sponsored actors could have\nimpersonated legitimate system operators to conduct unauthorized operations. According to the\nevidence obtained by CISA and FBI, the Chinese state-sponsored actors made no attempts to\nmodify the pipeline operations of systems they accessed. Note: there was a significant number\nof cases where log data was not available, and the depth of intrusion and persistent impacts\nwere unable to be determined; at least 8 of 23 cases (35 percent) identified in the campaign\nwere assessed as having an unknown depth of intrusion due to the lack of log data.\n\nCISA and FBI assess that during these intrusions, China was successful in accessing the\nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks at several U.S. natural gas pipeline\ncompanies.\n\nChinese actors also gained information specific to dial-up access, including phone numbers,\nusernames, and passwords [T1120]. Dial-up modems continue to be prevalent in the Energy\nSector, providing direct access into the ICS environment with little or no security and no\nmonitoring, which makes them an optimal vector for hold-at-risk operations. The exfiltrated data\nprovided the capabilities for the Chinese cyber actors to access ONG operational systems at a\nlevel where they could potentially conduct unauthorized operations.\n\n### Exfiltrated Information and Assessed Motives\n\nThe Chinese actors specifically targeted information that pertained to access of ICSs. Searches\nwere made for terms involving “SCAD*,” and the actors exfiltrated documents, including\npersonnel lists, usernames and passwords, dial-up access information, remote terminal unit\n(RTU) sites, and systems manuals. The Chinese actors also exfiltrated information pertaining to\nICS permission groups and compromised jump points between corporate and ICS networks. The\ntotality of this information would allow the actors to access ICS networks via multiple channels\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA\n\nand would provide sufficient access to allow them to remotely perform unauthorized operations\non the pipeline with physical consequences.\n\nCISA and FBI assess that these intrusions were likely intended to gain strategic access to the\nICS networks for future operations rather than for intellectual property theft. This assessment\nwas based on the content of the data that was being exfiltrated and the TTPs used to gain that\naccess. One victim organization set up a honeypot that contained decoy documents with content\nthat appeared to be SCADA-related data and sensitive organizational information. According to\nthis organization, the SCADA-related decoy content was exfiltrated within 15 minutes of the time\nit was made available in the honeypot. Other sensitive decoy information, including financial and\nbusiness-related information, was ignored.\n\nCISA and FBI assess that this activity was ultimately intended to help China develop cyberattack\ncapabilities against U.S. pipelines to physically damage pipelines or disrupt pipeline operations.\n\n## INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\nTable 1 lists indicators related to this spearphishing and intrusion campaign as of May 7, 2012,\nwhich are provided in this alert for historical completeness.\n\n_Table 1: IOCs from Chinese Gas Pipeline Intrusion Campaign, 2011 to 2013_\n\n|Type|Indicator|Filename|\n|---|---|---|\n|Malware|MD5:84873fae9cdecb84452ff f9cca171004 ntshrui.dll||\n|Malicious email content, including any attachments and/or message body|fpso.bigish[.]net||\n|Malware|MD5:e12ce62cf7de42581c2f e1d7f36d521c ntshrui.dll||\n|User agent string|Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;
