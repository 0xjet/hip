Not every function that is planned for\nthe final product is implemented right from the start. It does not come as a surprise that this\nis also true for the development of malware. At the G DATA Security Labs, a file has sparked\nthe interest of our researchers - this file is interesting for a number of reasons.\n\n## Who commissioned it?\n\nThe new espionage tool which was was christened \"Rurktar\" allows some conclusions as to\nits origin. It is very likely that it originates from Russia. There is quite some evidence to\nsupport this: some of the internal error messages of Rurktar are in Russian. Also, the IP\naddresses used for remote control of the spyware are located in Russia.\n\nIt is not 100 per cent clear whether Rurktar is the work of a single individual or a\ndevelopment team. What we can say, though, is that a Dropbox folder is used as a working\ndirectory. There are several possible reasons for this. One of them is that several developers\nare cooperating here and consolidate their work through a Dropbox. What Dropbox can also\nbe used for by a single individual is a crude and very basic versioning system - some\n\n\n-----\n\nDropbox accounts offer the possibility of restoring earlier versions of a file. Therefore, it can\nbe used to track changes, but it is not ideal from a developer's stand point. Using Dropbox as\na backup is, of course, also a possibility to be considered here.\n\n## Objectives\n\nRurktar error message in Russian\n\nAlthough not all of the functions are omplemented yet, it is relatively safe to say that Rurktar\nis intended for use in targeted spying operations. The functions that are already implemented\nallow reconnaissance of a network infrastructure, they can check whether or not a particular\nmachine is reachable, take screen shots and even download specific files from an infected\nmachine. It is also possible to delete files from or upload files to a machine. All of this points\nto industrial espionage - the functions that have been described so far do not have any\npractical application for large-scale operations, such as ransomware schemes.\n\n## Prevalence\n\nAs the spyware is still in a development state and not operational yet, it has not spread very\nwidely.\nThose few IP addresses that have been linked to Rurktar so far could just as well only have\nbeen used for testing purposes by the developer(s). This, however, can and will change as\ndevelopment work progresses. The IP addresses used for remote controlling Rurktar will see\nmore diversity and not only be confined to Russia but to other countries as well. This is also\ndue to the fact that other actors will start using or repurposing the malware either entirely or\nin parts. Past experiences have shown that many malidious programs are used by so-called\n\"script kiddies\" who intend to cobble together new malware using readily available parts\nwhile having only minimal coding skills. This has happened, for instance, with the\n[\"HiddenTear\" ransomware, which was originally designed for training and education. It had](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2016/11/29289-it-s-educational-on-the-no-1-argument-for-open-source-ransomware)\nsome flaws in its cryptographic components (which had also been documented by the\ndeveloper) - but this did not keep some from using the flawed encryption components to\ncreate \"real\" ransomware.\n\nThe versions of Rurktar which are known so far are detected by all G DATA solutions as\n**MSIL.Backdoor.Rurktar.A.**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Coming soon ?\n\nMany functions and configuration parameters are defined but not implemented yet. The\nfollowing table shows a small excerpt:\n\nFeature & configuration list of Rurktar - not all functions\n\nare implemented yet.\n\n## Detailled information\n\nYou can read up on further technical information in Nathan Stern's detailed analysis report.\nThe report is downloadable using the link below.\n\n[Malware](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/malware)\n[Exploits](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/exploits)\n[Vulnerabilities](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/vuelnerabilities)\n\n**Related articles:**\n\nIt's Educational - On the No 1 Argument for Open Source Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nResearchers have published several ransomware projects in the name of education and\nfreedom of knowledge. The question of their usefulness sparks…\n\n\n-----",
