This campaign, Operation\nSharpshooter, leverages an in-memory implant to download and retrieve a second-stage\nimplant—which we call Rising Sun—for further exploitation. According to our analysis, the\nRising Sun implant uses source code from the Lazarus Group’s 2015 backdoor Trojan\nDuuzer in a new framework to infiltrate these key industries.\n\nOperation Sharpshooter’s numerous technical links to the Lazarus Group seem too obvious\nto immediately draw the conclusion that they are responsible for the attacks, and instead\nindicate a potential for false flags Our research focuses on how this actor operates the\n\n\n-----\n\nglobal impact, and how to detect the attack. We shall leave attribution to the broader security\ncommunity.\n\n[Read our full analysis of Operation Sharpshooter.](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-operation-sharpshooter.pdf)\n\n**Have we seen this before?**\n\nThis campaign, while masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity, gathers\ninformation to monitor for potential exploitation. Our analysis also indicates similar\ntechniques associated with other job recruitment campaigns.\n\n**Global impact**\n\nIn October and November 2018, the Rising Sun implant has appeared in 87 organizations\nacross the globe, predominantly in the United States, based on McAfee telemetry and our\nanalysis. Based on other campaigns with similar behavior, most of the targeted organizations\nare English speaking or have an English-speaking regional office. This actor has used\nrecruiting as a lure to collect information about targeted individuals of interest or\norganizations that manage data related to the industries of interest. The McAfee Advanced\nThreat Research team has observed that the majority of targets were defense and\ngovernment-related organizations.\n\n_Targeted organizations by sector in October 2018. Colors indicate the most prominently_\n_affected sector in each country. Source: McAfee®_ _Global Threat Intelligence._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Infection flow of the Rising Sun implant, which eventually sends data to the attacker’s control_\n_servers._\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur discovery of this new, high-function implant is another example of how targeted attacks\nattempt to gain intelligence. The malware moves in several steps. The initial attack vector is\na document that contains a weaponized macro to download the next stage, which runs in\n\n\n-----\n\nmemory and gathers intelligence. The victim s data is sent to a control server for monitoring\nby the actors, who then determine the next steps.\n\nWe have not previously observed this implant. Based on our telemetry, we discovered that\nmultiple victims from different industry sectors around the world have reported these\nindicators.\n\nWas this attack just a first-stage reconnaissance operation, or will there be more? We will\ncontinue to monitor this campaign and will report further when we or others in the security\nindustry receive more information. The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team encourages\nour peers to share their insights and attribution of who is responsible for Operation\nSharpshooter.\n\n**Indicators of compromise**\n\n_MITRE ATT&CK™ techniques_\n\nAccount discovery\nFile and directory discovery\nProcess discovery\nSystem network configuration discovery\nSystem information discovery\nSystem network connections discovery\nSystem time discovery\nAutomated exfiltration\nData encrypted\nExfiltration over command and control channel\nCommonly used port\nProcess injection\n\n_Hashes_\n\n8106a30bd35526bded384627d8eebce15da35d17\n66776c50bcc79bbcecdbe99960e6ee39c8a31181\n668b0df94c6d12ae86711ce24ce79dbe0ee2d463\n9b0f22e129c73ce4c21be4122182f6dcbc351c95\n31e79093d452426247a56ca0eff860b0ecc86009\n\n_Control servers_\n\n34.214.99.20/view_style.php\n137.74.41.56/board.php\nkingkoil.com.sg/board.php\n\n_Document URLs_\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://208.117.44.112/document/Strategic Planning Manager.doc\nhxxp://208.117.44.112/document/Business Intelligence Administrator.doc\nhxxp://www.dropbox.com/s/2shp23ogs113hnd/Customer Service Representative.doc?\ndl=1\n\n_McAfee detection_\n\nRDN/Generic Downloader.x\nRising-Sun\nRising-Sun-DOC\n\n[Ryan Sherstobitoff](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/ryan-sherstobitoff/)\nRyan Sherstobitoff is a Senior Analyst for Major Campaigns – Advanced Threat Research in\nMcAfee.
