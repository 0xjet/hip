In the upcoming part two, AdvIntel will hold an analytical lens on BlackCat’s_\n_organizational, recruitment, and operations process. This part introduces the context and_\n\n\n-----\n\n_offers a deep dive into the group s technical capabilities which could herald a new breed of_\n_threat actors entering the cybercriminal ecosystem._\n\n**_The intelligence analysis for this case originates in AdvIntel's direct adversarial_**\n**_visibility into the BlackCat group and is based on primary source intelligence and not_**\n**_tertiary evidence._**\n\n**_ALPHV: An Introduction_**\n\n**ALPHV** [(more commonly known as BlackCat), is a ransomware group known for its highly-](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.blackcat)\ncustomizable feature set and Rust-written malware locker, allowing for attacks on a wide\nrange of corporate environments and the successful execution of a number of high-profile\n[attacks, including the Italian luxury brand Monclerand the aviation company Swissport.](https://ww.fashionnetwork.com/news/Moncler-getting-back-on-track-after-malware-attack,1365377.html)\n\n_BlackCat’s ransomware includes many advanced technical features which set it apart from_\n_most ransomware operations—these include the malware being entirely command-line_\n_driven, human-operated and adaptable, as well as its ability to use different encryption_\n_routines, spread between devices, and kill hypervisors, even wiping their snapshots to_\nprevent recovery.\n\n**In short, BlackCat’s unique strength seems to be in its adaptability, or willingness to**\n**change to fit its own current needs. So what enables BlackCat to set themselves apart**\n**from the rest?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Starting from Square One_**\n\nIt has long been speculated that unlike other groups of its kind, BlackCat not only uses an\nuncommon Rust-based malware (as opposed to the more commonly used C-based\nvariants), but also tend to avoid utilizing any of the same tools common in ransomware\noperations (such as Cobalt Strike, exploitations of Atera, Metasploit, etc).\n\nThis is a direct address to possibly the most pressing issue facing today’s ransomware\ncommunity—a fatigue of attack methodologies that has already contributed to the\ndissolution of established threat groups.\n\nFor years, only a few tools were being weaponized by cybercriminals to perform network\n[penetration, with Cobalt Strikebeing the most common. This created an entire generation of](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\ncriminal pentesters who were working for ransomware groups and trapped within their own\nnarrow toolboxes. This in turn allowed cyber-defense groups to focus on Cobalt Strike IOCs\nas a surefire warning sign, increasing the criminals’ chance of being spotted and ultimately\nlowering their attack persistences. Moreover, Cobalt Strike is a legitimate pentesting tool, not\n_originally conceived as a malware, which makes the efficiency of cyber defenses addressing_\nCS-weaponized attacks even more effective—because the software is, in a sense, designed\n_to be beaten._\n\n\n-----\n\n_A short positive review of BlackCat from the RAMP’s forum admin, a known ransomware_\n_developer with over a decade of cybercriminal experience._\n\nAs a result, ransomware collectives have been actively plotting an escape from the tunnelvision of the toolbox mindset. The now-defunct Conti, for instance, prepared a list of over\n**a hundred different network penetration and offensive alternatives, which included**\n**both legitimate tools as well as underground malware. But these initiatives never**\nachieved actual execution.\n\nBlackCat’s case diverges from the mainstream narrative, however, as the group has\nestablished an operation set around their own self-written offensive scripts. By creating\nentirely new tools to execute their operations, BlackCat has not only found what seems like\nan effective way to circumvent existing defense strategies, but also to ensure their own\n**_longevity—by changing along with the times. This sets BlackCat leagues ahead of its_**\ncompetitors.\n\n**_BlackCat’s Edge - Ransomware Binary Analysis: Tech Dive_**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdvIntel has observed BlackCat s ransomware binary to have quite a few different versions,\ndifferent flavors for the variety of operating system architecture it may come up against,\nincluding ESXI. Because of this range in ransomware binaries, many opportunities have\nbeen provided for our team to dissect AlphV’s internal operations due to its use of the Rust\nprogramming language.\n\n_AdvIntel has found the BlackCat deployment operation to involve one(1) direct execution_\n**_using domain and enterprise administrator hard-coded credentials._**\n\nAdditionally, the criminals launched the encryption operation via the domain controller global\n_policy update execution from SYSVOL directory and netlogon with scheduled tasks, followed_\nwith **_the following arguments from the primary domain controller (PDC):_**\n```\n·  /c \\\\DOMAIN.LOCAL \\netlogon\\locker.exe --access-token CODE\n·  gpupdate /force\n\n```\n**Windows x64 Version**\n\nBlackCat’s ransomware binary is written in Rust by mature and experienced coders, with\neach version of Windows or Linux library leveraging a usual combination of private and\npublic cryptography with Salsa20/AES and RSA. The malware coder has left the compiler\npath as \"C:\\Users\\runneradmin\" for the Windows library. Interestingly, the binary has its own\n_full user graphical interface launched via the access token, obtained by the affiliate from their_\nransomware panel.\n\n**Some of the notable malware features include self-propagation enumerating services**\n**and shares, PsExec for network-wide execution (\"arp -a'' enumeration) alongside the**\nleveraging of extensively safe boot functionality while modifying boot loader, establishing\nitself as 'service' in safeboot to enable it to bypass certain antivirus and endpoint detection\n_and response products. The ransomware binary also clears logs, removes volume_\n**_shadow copies and cleans up the Recycle Bin._**\n\nThe malware contains functionality to pass domain credentials to the \"net use\" function to\nallow system-wide access from a single machine with UAC bypass, leveraging the process\n_environment block (PEB) traversal technique to obtain API calls, as seen in the following:_\n```\nwin7_plus=true\ntoken_is_admin=\ntoken_is_domain_admin=\nmasquerade_peb\nUac_bypass::\nescalate=success\nescalate=failure\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, the malware leverages the usual Restart Manager API for accessing certain\nfiles, as well as the discovery of \"hidden partitions\".\n\n**Linux Debian x64 ESXI Version**\n\nThe ESXI version of the malware contains the logic to encrypt ESXI volumes in\n_/vmfs/volumes as well as renovating all virtual machines snapshots via the command line, as_\n_seen in the following:_\n```\nesxi/bin/esxclilog | | esxcli --formatter=csv --formatparam=fields==\"WorldID,DisplayName\" vm process list | awk -F \"\\\"*,\\\"*\"\n'{system(\"esxcli vm process kill --type=force --world-id=\"$1)}'for i in `vim-cmd\nvmsvc/getallvms| awk '{print$1}'`;do vim-cmd vmsvc/snapshot.removeall $i & done\n\n```\n**_The Mirror Worlds of Cybercriminals_**\n\n_BlackCat update announcement post on the criminal forum RAMP._\n\nWhat’s important to note is that BlackCat’s foundation for their clean start is more about the\ngroup’s mindset, rather than its toolkit. From the get-go, BlackCat has been searching for\n_outside-the-box solutions to ransomware’s biggest obstacles, both operationally and_\norganizationally.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor years now, extortionist groups have mainly adhered to the RaaS, or Ransomware-as-a_Service model, enabling their affiliates to rent already-developed ransomware tools to_\nindependently execute their attacks. Apart from Conti, Cl0p, and DoppelPaymer, most\nransomware collectives have tended to be loosely organized, with very little internal structure\nholding them together—the cybercriminal ecosystem, due to the illegal nature of its\nexistence, is inherently unstable and chaotic, with groups disbanding and rebranding\n_constantly within the trade’s very young lifespan._\n\nThis constant, kinetic movement is strangely reminiscent of the high attrition rate of startup\n_companies—the cybercriminal community, specifically the ransomware community, can_\nsometimes be a black mirror of real-world crime syndicates or even legitimate\nbusinesses:the high turnover in startup companies shows an above-ground parallel to the\nmovement of threat actors in and out of ransomware collectives because both industries tend\nto suffer from similar issues: this can includelack of regulation, high competition, “sniping” of\n_[talented members, structural issues, and general lack of dedication to maintaining growth](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-12-reasons-why-startups-fail?utm_campaign=marketing_startup-failure_2021-07&campaignid=15901856338&adgroupid=132265684317&utm_term=why%20startups%20fail&utm_campaign=Reports&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=adwords-reports-popular-content&hsa_tgt=aud-304773227230:kwd-300117606120&hsa_grp=132265684317&hsa_src=g&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_mt=e&hsa_ver=3&hsa_ad=575352841337&hsa_acc=5728918340&hsa_kw=why%20startups%20fail&hsa_cam=15901856338&gclid=CjwKCAjwrqqSBhBbEiwAlQeqGpadT42kEMhGDXv4p3oWf8K71axe8X0NqhOzD-OFtizJA5j6txycPRoCTwcQAvD_BwE)_\n_and structure._\n\n**_BlackCat & REvil: Avoiding the Mistakes of the Past_**\n\n**Conversely, the RaaS model is both named for and reflective of the** **_Software-as-a-_**\n**_Service model, which is used nigh-universally across the enterprise software industry._**\n\nInitially, the SaaS model of “on-demand software” was focused on managing and hosting\n_third-party software from independent vendors. However, over time, SaaSvendors began to_\ndevelop their own proprietary software, _cutting out the middle-man in the arrangement._\n\n**BlackCat has done the same with its operational model. The group’s Admin (according to**\nAdvIntel investigation) is a former member of REvil, which was dismantled after FSB raids in\nearly 2022. However, when it came time to rebrand, instead of merely recreating REvil’s\npayload, BlackCat instead decided to create their own.\n\nThe group seems to be avoiding a mere retread of REvil’s footsteps, and for good reason—\nas earlier stated, ransomware collectives based around “on-demand software” with no\npersonal innovation model have a tendency to explode into infamy before quickly burning\n\n\n-----\n\nout. For instance, Avaddon, Maze, Egregor, and REvil, who by all accounts were already\non the verge of death by the time its members were arrested.\n\n_AdvIntel's visibility into BlackCat’s panel—a mimic of REvil’s previous panel._\n\n**BlackCat’s decision to “start from scratch”, writing new, highly-configurable malware**\n**in a lesser-utilized programming language reflects a parallel demand within RaaS to**\n**its SaaS namesake: the demand for new, specialized tools that would allow BlackCat**\n**to corner the ransomware market at a time when development is desperately needed**\n**in order for threat groups to survive.**\n\n**_On Trend: Cornering the Black Market_**\n\nMoreover, SaaS’s more recent developments have recently seen another notable trend: the\nshift from horizontal SaaS, or software that applies broadly to a wide variety of industries, to\n_vertical SaaS, which targets specific industry niches and standards._\n\n_RaaS’s movement as a model within the threat landscape indicates that its next steps are_\n_similar: the most innovative threat groups, BlackCat included, seem to be honing in, with a_\ngreater emphasis in their malware’s exclusivity, customization features, and ability to target\n_specific entities. As of right now, BlackCat’s exclusive, highly-configurable Rust-based locker_\n[seems unprecedented, with government agencies scrambling to classify IOCs for the group](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220420.pdf)\nwhile their target count continues to rise.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe current threat landscape is now undergoing changes that have only become more\npronounced in recent weeks, as larger and more established groups such as Conti have\nquickly disintegrated, its previous affiliates surreptitiously forming new groups, or\n**joining existing ones.**\n\nThe new threat groups that result from this dispersion have the benefit of utilizing their new\nmembers’ advanced capabilities as former affiliates of larger and more established\nransomware collectives. The novel groups have emerged from members who yield extremely\nniche operational skillsets, in turn making the groups’ functionalities increasingly specialized.\nIf access brokerage trends further towards the specific targeting of organizations and\n_industries,_ **group specialization may even begin to influence what tools are used and**\n**developed by different groups, as we are currently seeing with the breakneck**\n**evolution of the BazarCall attack vector.**\n\n**_Conclusions—RaaS: Resiliency-as-a-Service_**\n\nDespite its innovations to the model, BlackCat, like its contemporaries, still falls under the\ncategory of a Ransomware-as-a-Service group. RaaS didn’t take its title from SaaS merely\nas a joke; both models function “on-demand”—or as their names indicate, “as-a-Service”. As\nthe criminal ecosystem continues to evolve at an alarming pace, BlackCat’s methodologies\n**may soon become representative of the scene as demand for specificity increases—**\n**_with broader threat groups who fail to adapt left to become obsolete._**\n\n**Adversarial Assessment Summary [ALPHV/BlackCat]**\n\n**ALPHV/BlackCat [Threat Group]**\n\nMalware Type: Ransomware\n\nOrigin: Eastern Europe\n\nIntelligence Source: High Confidence\n\nFunctionality:\n\n\n-----\n\nData encryption\n\nData exfiltration\n\nLocker creation\n\nMalware configurability/adaptivity\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Framework:\n\nT1070 - Indicator Removal on Host\n\nT1070.001 - Clear Windows Event Logs\n\nT1078.003 - Local Accounts\n\nT1562.001 - Disable or Modify Tools\n\nT1048 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\n\nT1048.002 -Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol\n\nT1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nDistribution:\n\nProprietary Locker Malware (Rust-coded)\n\nFortinet VPN Exploitation\n\nPersistency: Very High\n\nInfection Rate: High\n\nDecrypter: Not Released\n\n**_Threat Assessment: Critical_**\n\n**Recommendations & Mitigations [ALPHV/BlackCat]**\n\n_[The FBI has recently released an official profile on BlackCat ransomware.
