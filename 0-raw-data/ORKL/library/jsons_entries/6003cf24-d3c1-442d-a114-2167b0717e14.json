After infection, it checks whether the keyboard language is set\nto Russian, Kazakh, Belarus or Ukrainian and, if so, exits without encrypting. Otherwise, it\nencrypts files and deletes shadow copies to prevent the user from restoring them.\n\nAfter encryption, it displays a ransom message:\n\nThe new Bitdefender decryptor can restore the following file extensions:\n\n\n-----\n\n_. FC, . 2ksys19, . p3rf0rm4, . Recognizer, . VACv2, . paradise, . CORP, .immortal, . exploit, ._\n_prt, . STUB, . sev, . sambo_\n\n**How to use this tool**\n\n**Step 1: Download the decryption tool below and save it on your computer.**\n\n[Download the Paradise decryptor](http://download.bitdefender.com/am/malware_removal/BDParadiseDecryptTool.exe)\n\n_Note: This tool does not require an active internet connection._\n\n**Step 2: Double-click the file (previously saved as BDParadiseDecryptor.exe ) and allow it to**\nrun by clicking Yes in the UAC prompt.\n\n**Step 3: Agree to the End User License Agreement**\n\nWe strongly recommend you also select “Backup files” before starting the decryption\nprocess, in case anything occurs while decrypting. Then press “Scan”.\n\nThe “test folder” must contain a pair of original/encrypted files, which will be used to\ndetermine the decryption key. It is essential that this folder only contain a pair of original\n**and encrypted files and both files should be at least 15 kb in size.**\n\n\n-----\n\nUsers may also check the “Overwrite existing clean files” option under “Advanced options” so\nthe tool will overwrite possible clean files present with their decrypted equivalent.\n\nAt the end of this step, your files should have been decrypted.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please contact us at forensics@bitdefender.com.\n\nIf you checked the backup option, you will see both the encrypted and decrypted files. You\ncan also find a log describing the decryption process, in %temp%\\BDRemovalTool folder:\n\nTo get rid of your encrypted files after decryption, just search for files matching the extension\nand remove them in bulk. We do not encourage you to do this, unless you have doublechecked that your files can be opened safely and none of the decrypted files are damaged.\n\n**Silent execution (via cmdline)**\n\nThe tool can also be executed silently via a command line. If you need to automate\ndeployment of the tool inside a large network, you might want to use this feature.\n\n**-help – provides information on how to run the tool silently (this information will be**\nwritten in the log file, not on console)\n\n**start - this argument allows the tool to run silently (no GUI)**\n–path - this argument specifies the path to scan\n–test - this argument specifies the test path to a pair of original/encrypted files\n**o0:1 - enables Scan entire system option (ignoring -path argument)**\n**o1:1 - enables Backup files option**\n**o2:1 - enables Overwrite existing files option**\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**BDParadiseDecryptor.exe start -path:”C:\\” -> the tool will start with no GUI and scan C:\\**\n\n**BDParadiseDecryptor.exe start o0:1 -> the tool will start with no GUI and scan the entire**\nsystem\n\n\n-----\n\n**BDParadiseDecryptor.exe start o0:1 o1:1 o2:1 -> the tool will scan the entire system,**\nbackup encrypted files and overwrite present clean files\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\nThis product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project, for use in the OpenSSL\n[Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)](http://www.openssl.org/)\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/) [free tools](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/free-tools/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Bitdefender\n\nThe meaning of Bitdefender’s mascot, the Dacian Draco, a symbol that depicts a mythical\nanimal with a wolf’s head and a dragon’s body, is “to watch” and to “guard with a sharp eye.”\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/bitdefenderteam/)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
