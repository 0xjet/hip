The\nsupported files that can be uploaded are either a docx, .gif, .pdf, .png, .pptx, .xlsx, or .zip\nfile.\n\nOnce a file is uploaded, Tesorian's servers will compute the decryption key for the uploaded\nfile and send it back and load into the decryptor.\n\nOnce loaded, victims can then select the folder or drive that they wish to decrypt and begin\nrecovering their files.\n\n**Decrypted Files**\nIn the earlier builds shared with BleepingComputer, we hit some issues on certain file types.\nWith the latest release tested today, the decryptor worked very well and was able to recover\nmost of the encrypted files on my test machine.\n\nThe only files it was not able to decrypt were non-standard file formats, but as previously\nstated, Tesorion continues to support new file types every day.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to download the decryptor, users can contact the [Tesorion CSIRT and request help](https://www.tesorion.nl/incidents/)\nwith the Nemty Ransomware. Tesorion will then send a link to the decryptor that will allow\nyou to decrypt your files.\n\nTesorion has told us that they are currently working with Europol to get their decryptor on\nthe NoMoreRansom site so that it will become more widely available to victims.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Free decryptor released for Yanluowang ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-yanluowang-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Decryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decryptor/)\n[Nemty Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nemty-ransomware/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
