Its powerful spyware was recently found in Kazakhstan and Romania.\nEurope’s parliamentarians voice growing concern about an out-of-control surveillance\nindustry and call for it to be regulated.\n\nConfidential data seen by Lighthouse Reports shows that a little-known company based in\nRome, Tykelab, has been using dozens of phone networks, often on remote Pacific islands,\nto send tens of thousands of secret “tracking packets” around the world, targeting people in\ncountries including Libya, Nicaragua, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Iraq, Mali, Greece and Portugal\n– as well as in Italy itself.\n\nIt’s doing this by exploiting longstanding but frequently unfixed vulnerabilities in global phone\nnetworks which make it possible for third parties to see phone users’ locations, and\npotentially intercept their calls, without any record of compromise being left on their devices.\n\nAt the same time, Tykelab’s parent company, RCS Lab, has developed a powerful phone\nhacking tool, Hermit, which once installed on a victim’s device can be used to remotely\nactivate the phone’s microphone, as well as record calls, access messages, call logs,\ncontacts, photos and other sensitive data.\n\n\n-----\n\nBehind the scenes, security professionals have raised the alarm about Tykelab s activities.\nAnalysts with access to confidential telecom data described how the company was\n“persistently and systematically” attempting to bypass network protections as well as carrying\nout “blatant and targeted tracking of individuals”.\n\n“They are becoming more and more active,” one told us. “Since the start of this year, they’ve\nbeen increasing the number of attacks, and now it’s constant.”\n\nAs the European Union wakes up to the threat posed by an out-of-control surveillance\nindustry, with Israel’s notorious NSO Group and its Pegasus software in its crosshairs, we\nreveal the scope and scale of a previously unknown surveillance vendor in the heart of the\nEU.\n\n**METHODS**\n\nOur findings originated with two confidential sources in the telecom industry. They had both\nindependently been tracking significant volumes of suspicious traffic sent through a group of\nphone networks – much of it ostensibly from islands in the South Pacific. Through technical\nand other data they determined, independently from each other, that this traffic originated in\nItaly with a company called Tykelab. The company’s website says it’s an innocuous telecom\nservices provider. Our sources said that its traffic had no legitimate purpose other than\nsurveillance.\n\nWe sent samples of the data our sources provided to two independent security experts:\nKarsten Nohl, from Security Research Labs in Germany, and Jean Gottschalk, from Telecom\nDefense Ltd in the USA. Both agreed with our sources’ analysis. “Someone is spying on a\nlarge scale via the phone network,” said Nohl.\n\nThrough corporate disclosures and financial data, we established that Tykelab is a part of\nRCS Lab, an Italian company with a long history of interception activities both in Italy and\nabroad. This fact was undisclosed until a takeover by a third company, Cy4Gate, made it\nknown to shareholders last December. We also established that RCS Lab has another\nconcealed subsidiary, Azienda Informatica Italiana, which builds interception software for\nAndroid and iPhone devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nTykelab’s office in a suburb of Rome with the company logo clearly visible inside\nWe obtained unpublished brochures of RCS Lab’s products and services from an invite-only\ntrade fair. These included details of Ubiqo, a tool which can “track the movements of almost\nanybody who carries a mobile phone, whether they are blocks away or on another\ncontinent”, as well as offering more sophisticated behaviour analysis. We used IoT search\nengines Censys and Shodan to scan RCS Lab’s Italian infrastructure and found a login for a\nwebpage with the slogan “powered by Tykelab”.\n\nDuring our investigation, cybersecurity specialists at Lookout and Google published details of\na previously unknown but sophisticated hacking package called Hermit. They both\nindependently attributed this package to RCS Lab and provided lists of fake internet domains\nwhich the company had set up to lure targets to download the software. They included\ndomains masquerading as Apple and Facebook, as well various telecom providers. We\n[analysed this list using the domain database WhoisXML API and found that RCS Lab](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/)\npurchased some of these fake domains as early as 2015, while others were bought in March\nthis year – indicating years of potential hacking operations by the company.\n\nWe interviewed Lookout’s Justin Albrecht and Paul Shunk, who confirmed further details of\nthe Hermit spyware, including that they had recently observed it in action in another country,\nRomania.\n\n\n-----\n\n**STORYLINES**\n\nSince 2021 a wave of hacking scandals has engulfed EU countries, with tools supposedly\nmeant for the most serious criminals being turned against politicians and journalists. The\n[European Parliament is holding hearings, focusing particularly on Israel’s NSO Group and its](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/pega/events/events-hearings)\nflagship Pegasus spyware. But our investigation has thrown the spotlight on the EU itself and\nEurope’s role in the high-risk proliferation of commercial surveillance technology.\n\nOur findings show Tykelab’s surveillance traffic reaching all over the world – the Italian\ncompany’s systems have been targeting people in Libya, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Pakistan,\nMalaysia, Iraq and Mali, to give only a few specific examples, as well as in Greece,\nMacedonia, Portugal and Italy.\n\nMEPs, security specialists and privacy experts, looking at our findings, expressed deep\nconcern at the risks associated with the untransparent trade in powerful spy tech and\nquestioned whether EU member states were doing enough to regulate it.\n\nAs Markéta Gregorová, the European Parliament’s rapporteur for surveillance technology\nexport controls, told us: “Commercial cyber-surveillance secretly sold to anyone willing to pay\nis a global security risk for all of us inside and outside the European Union. This service gets\nhuman right activists and journalists tortured and killed.”\n\nWhile highlighting problems in Europe’s export policies, the investigation also exposes the\nlittle-known practice in the telecom industry which enables these types of abuses to flourish –\nthe leasing of phone network access points or “global titles”. We spoke to the mobile phone\ntrade association, GSMA, who confirmed to us that “organisations improperly using leased\nglobal titles must be stopped”. But the association pointed out that phone operators cannot\nalways identify the source and purpose of the traffic that flows through their networks,\nmaking it difficult to curtail the surveillance industry.\n\nSecurity expert Karsten Nohl emphasised that it is now eight years since critical\nvulnerabilities in how mobile phone networks function were disclosed – the same\nvulnerabilities which Tykelab and others have weaponised for surveillance purposes. Nohl\nsaid: “Firewalls have long been in place so that phone operators can protect their customers\n— but this research proves that not all worldwide phone providers have set up these basic\nprotections. It is very unfortunate that these vulnerabilities have still not been closed.”\n\n_[To keep up to date with Lighthouse investigations sign up for our monthly newsletter](https://bit.ly/LHR-newsletter)_\n\n\n-----",
