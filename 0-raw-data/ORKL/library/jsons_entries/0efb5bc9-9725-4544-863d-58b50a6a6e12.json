They keys for\ndecryption, including another resource from one of the binaries are:\n\n{0x25, 0x7f, 0x5d, 0xfb}\n\n{0x17, 0xd4, 0xba, 0x00}\n\n{0x5c, 0xc2, 0x1a, 0xbb}\n\n{0x15, 0xaf, 0x52, 0xf0}\n\nThe malware appears to be collecting information about ?interesting� files on the infected\nsystem:\n\ndir “C:Documents and Settings” /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i download 2>nul >f1.inf\n\ndir “C:Documents and Settings” /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i document 2>nul >>f1.inf\n\ndir C:Users /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i download 2>nul >>f1.inf\n\ndir C:Users /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i document 2>nul >>f1.inf\n\ndir C:Users /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i picture 2>nul >>f1.inf\n\ndir C:Users /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i video 2>nul >>f1.inf\n\ndir C:Users /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i music 2>nul >>f1.inf\n\ndir “C:Documents and Settings” /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i desktop 2>nul >f2.inf\n\ndir C:Users /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -i desktop 2>nul >>f2.inf\n\ndir C:WindowsSystem32Drivers /s /b /a:-D 2>nul >>f2.inf\n\ndir C:WindowsSystem32Config /s /b /a:-D 2>nul | findstr -v -i systemprofile 2>nul >>f2.inf\n\n\n-----\n\ndir f1.inf /s /b 2>nul >>f1.inf\n\ndir f2.inf /s /b 2>nul >>f1.inf\n\nInside resource 112, another resource (101) exists which contains a signed disk driver:\n\nThe disk driver itself does not appear to be malicious. However, it is used for raw disk access\nby the malware components to wipe the MBR of infected systems.\n\nInterestingly, the driver is signed by EldoS Corporation, a company that has a mission to ?\n_Help people feel confident about integrity and security of valuable information,� according to_\n[their website.](https://www.eldos.com/)\n\nAlso:\n\n_EldoS Corporation is an international company specializing in development of security-_\n_related software components for corporate market and individual software developers._\n\n\n-----\n\nOf course, one big question emerges: ?Is this the malware known as Wiper, that attacked\nIran in April 2012?�\n\n**Our opinion, based on researching several systems attacked by the original Wiper, is**\n**that it is not. The original ?Wiper� was using certain service names (?RAHD…�)**\n**together with specific filenames for its drivers (?%temp%~dxxx.tmp�) which do not**\n**appear to be present in this malware. Additionally, the original Wiper was using a**\n**certain pattern to wipe disks which again is not used by this malware.**\n\nIt is more likely that this is a copycat, the work of a script kiddies inspired by the story.\nNowadays, destructive malware is rare; the main focus of cybercriminals is financial profit.\nCases like the one here do not appear very often.\n\nWe detect the 32 bit components of the malware as Trojan.Win32.EraseMBR.a. The 64 bit\ncomponent is detected as Trojan.Win64.EraseMBR.a. We proactively detected the main\ndropper by heuristics as “HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic”\n\nPS: We are not yet sure of the meaning of ?Shamoon�. It could be a reference to the\nShamoon College of Engineering http://www.sce.ac.il/eng/. Or, it could simply be the name of\none of the malware authors. Shamoon is the equivalent of Simon in Arabic.\n\n**Update(17 Aug 2012): Our friends from** Seculert have posted their own analysis of the\nShamoon attack. They suggest it is a two stage attack, with lateral movement.\n\n**Update(17 Aug 2012): During the past 24 hours, we have collected telemetry from our users**\non Trojan.Win32.EraseMBR.a sightings. So far, there are only two reports, both from China,\nwhich appear to be security researchers. So we can conclude that the malware is not\nwidespread and it was probably only used in very focused targeted attacks.\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Microsoft](https://securelist.com/tag/microsoft/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n[Wiper](https://securelist.com/tag/wiper/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nShamoon the Wiper – Copycats at Work\n\n\n-----\n\nYour email address will not be published.
