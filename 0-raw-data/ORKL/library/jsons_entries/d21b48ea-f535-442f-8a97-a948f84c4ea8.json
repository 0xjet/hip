We observed multiple instances of attacks involving this\nRAT, and all of them happened in Central Asia. Among the targeted subjects were several important companies in the telecommunications\nand gas industries, and governmental entities.\n\nMoreover, we connect the dots between the latest campaign and three previously published reports: Kaspersky’s Microcin against Russian\nmilitary personnel, [Palo Alto Networks’ BYEBY against the Belarussian government and Checkpoint’s](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-threat-actors-target-government-belarus-using-cmstar-trojan) Vicious Panda against the Mongolian\npublic sector. Also, we discuss other malware that was typically a part of the attacker’s toolset together with the RAT. We chose the name\nMikroceen to cover all instances of the RAT, in acknowledgement of Kaspersky’s initial report on the family. The misspelling is intentional, in\n[order to avoid the established microbiological notion, but also to have at least phonemic agreement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcin)\n\n## Clustering\n\nFirst let’s discuss the clustering of Mikroceen, which is a simple RAT, and show our reasons for thinking reports from Kaspersky, Palo Alto\nNetworks and Checkpoint write about the same specific malware family (among other malicious tools mentioned). Figure 1 provides a\ncomparison of the decryption loop that is used for configuration data consisting of the C&C domain, a name and a password associated with\neach sample of the RAT. The loop is practically the same and it is implemented in three copies in a row. Checkpoint also discussed the\nsimilarities of the HTTP headers in the data sections between BYEBY and Vicious Panda, and a shared logging message V09SS0lO that\nbase64 decodes to WORKIN. The encoded string is also present in Microcin.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Part of the code used to decipher internal data; the exported DLL name is at the bottom_\n\nIn the section _Attackers’ arsenal below we also compare the command grammars of the RAT’s features and typical error messages that are_\nlogged during execution with its previous instances. To support the evidence, the preferred provider of the attackers’ infrastructure and the\nmost typical malware simultaneously found on the compromised networks. All these clues should evoke strong confidence that it’s the same\nmalware family.\n\n## Timeline & victimology\n\nFigure 2 sketches the evolution how the threat was tracked in time. As we mentioned earlier, the Central Asian region joined Russia, Belarus\nand Mongolia as areas with victims of Mikroceen intrusions. These victims were not desktop users, but endpoints in corporate networks\nwhere a higher level of security is expected.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Timeline of events related to Mikroceen_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. The recent campaigns in Central Asia surrounded by the previously reported ones_\n\n## Attackers’ arsenal\n\nLet us describe the tools the attackers used in their campaign in Central Asia. Unfortunately, we were unable to discover how they got into the\ncompromised networks.\n\n### RAT (client-side backdoor)\n\nOnce the intruders establish a foothold on a victim machine, the code in Figure 4 serves to install the RAT on the system. Note the parameter\nstart= auto, which establishes the malware’s persistence after a reboot.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\n@echo off\n\nsc stop PCAudit\n\nsc delete PCAudit\n\nsc create PCAudit binpath= \"C:\\WINDOWS\\syswow64\\svchost.exe -k netsvcs\" type= share start= auto displayname= \"Windows\nUpload Manager\"\n\nsc description PCAudit \"Windows Help Service is a microsoft Windows component for System(Important).

The name of the bot appears in the\nserver-side interface. What is quite unusual is that an operator needs to authenticate by entering the client’s password in order to control the\nclient. We can only speculate about the purpose, but it could serve as protection against botnet takeover, in case a competing actor or law\nenforcement seize their infrastructure. So, we see that certain effort was put on the security of the client-server connection. Moreover, the\nclient can connect directly to the C&C server or route the traffic via a proxy, which could be useful – especially in corporate networks. The\nconnection is further secured by a certificate and this is a feature that distinguishes Mikroceen from the legion of backdoors we have seen\nsince previously.\n\nMikroceen uses the same basic features as already described Palo Alto Networks about BYEBY. The grammar of commands is quite specific,\nbecause each command is truncated to 6 letters and then base64 encoded. That results an 8-letter incomprehensible word in the code. While\nin previous cases the encoding was straightforward, in the campaign in Central Asia there’s additional unknown encryption layer added. The\nconnection of the 8-letter words with the commands in that case was done by agreement on the code level.\n\n**Command** **Microcin, BYEBY, Vicious Panda** **Mikroceen**\n\nhello! aGVsbG8h AmbZDkEx\n\nGOODBY R09PREJZ eYTS5IwW\n\nBYE BY QllFIEJZ bo7aO8Nb\n\nDISCON RElTQ09O 6GEI6owo\n\nLIST D TElTVCBE Ki0Swb7I\n\nSTARTC U1RBUlRD h71RBG8X\n\nCOMMAN Q09NTUFO 5fdi2TfG\n\nTRANSF + (UPLOAD, DOWNLO) VFJBTlNG + (VVBMT0FE, RE9XTkxP) J8AoctiB + (QHbU0hQo, hwuvE43y)\n\nEXECUT RVhFQ1VU gRQ7mIYr\n\n_Table 1.

Logging messages in a temporary file_\n\n### Simultaneously occurring malware\n\nThe previous reports always mention a wide arsenal of tools that are used in the attacks. In our case it was the same – not just Mikroceen,\nbut other malware as well. Here are the three most important tools we observed in the compromised networks.\n\n**Lateral movement via Mimikatz**\n\nThe attackers used their implementation of Mimikatz, delivered via a two-stage mechanism: the first stage was a dropper usually called\ninstaller.exe or Yokel64.exe, which dropped the main payload with an indicative external DLL name mktz64.dll in the second stage. While\nMikroceen has never come with debug information, here we can see the string E:\\2018_\\MimHash\\mimikatz\\Bin\\mktzx64.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. A PDB string in the Mimikatz payload_\n\nMimikatz is an open source project by French security researcher Benjamin Delpy, developed since 2007. It’s a robust tool that, among other\nthings, can bypass various Windows authentication schemes, basically by dumping credential data from the Windows Local Security Account\n[database. It’s mainly used by red teams in IT security but also misused across the spectrum of APT actors, e.g. Lazarus Group,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/03/lazarus-killdisk-central-american-casino/) [Telebots,](http://welivesecurity.com/2018/10/11/new-telebots-backdoor-linking-industroyer-notpetya/)\n[Okrum etc. After running it in a test virtual environment, its output is (the incorrect spaces before the commas are in the original):](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/07/18/okrum-ke3chang-targets-diplomatic-missions/)\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\n#1 domain = MSEDGEWIN10, user = Administrator, nthash=FC525C9683E8FE067095BA2DDC971889.\n\n#2 domain = MSEDGEWIN10, user = IEUser, nthash=FC525C9683E8FE067095BA2DDC971889.\n\n\n**Lateral movement via WMI**\n\nThe attackers use an additional tool to spread in the hosting network. This time they leverage Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).\nAll relevant data is needed as the file’s name, as during the execution it expects @@<ComputerName>,<UserName>,<Password>,.exe. In\nthe first step, a console to a remote computer is established, where the connection is identified by <ComputerName> and authenticated with\n(<UserName>, <Password>). Afterwards, proxy security is set to the strict level, which means arguments of each remote procedure call are\nencrypted and the server’s access to local resources is allowed. Then WMI is used again to retrieve the Win32_Process class, which in turn\nis used to create a process with given parameters. When all the work is done, the tool terminates itself.\n\n**Gh0st RAT**\n\nThis [infamous, old RAT was created around 2008. In this instance it was found as rastls.dll on the compromised systems, while the exported](https://citizenlab.ca/2009/03/tracking-ghostnet-investigating-a-cyber-espionage-network/)\nDLL name is usually svchost.dll. It tries to connect with https://yuemt.zzux[.]com:443, which resolves to an IP address in China. This is an\nexception with no explanation, because the server doesn’t belong to any of the C&C providers used by Mikroceen. From our point of view, it\nseems redundant to use this additional backdoor, whose capacity is fully provided by Mikroceen itself.\n\nTo recognize this backdoor, one observes the string Gh0st within the binary. The character string uwqixgze} is used as a placeholder for the\nC&C domain.­\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Gh0st RAT malware (fragment)_\n\n### C&C panel (server-side interface)\n\nThe previous reports already mention the poor operational security of the attackers (their open directories were observed by Kaspersky and\nCheckpoint), and the actors behind continue to leak tools not necessarily leveraged on the victims’ side. We were able to get our hands on an\nolder version of RAT’s control panel. On the lower part of Figure 7 there’s a graphical interface through which all bots are commanded. It is\nvery minimalistic, which may be due to an older version from 2017, but still, just compare it with the greater than 10-year-old panel of Gh0st\nRAT. There’s not much improved since, visually or functionally, so the introduction of SSL connections seems like the main shift between the\nprojects (the text box for “CN Name” on the figure). It seems that the operators of the botnet are content customers of Vultr services, a child\ncompany of Choopa LLC, as their operational infrastructure is mostly hosted there, and this was also observed in the Vicious Panda\n[campaign by Checkpoint. This is a bullet-proof provider, documented by researchers from Cisco as early as 2015.](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/14/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Interfaces for controlling bots: Gh0st RAT (2008) vs. Mikroceen’s interface (2017)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe have presented the analysis of a custom implementation of a client-server model developed for spying purposes. The malware\ndevelopers put great effort into the security and robustness of the connection with their victims and the operators managed to penetrate highprofile corporate networks. Moreover, they have a larger toolset of attack tools at their disposal and their projects are under constant\ndevelopment, mostly visible as variations in obfuscation.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n[Here are the hashes of samples described in the article.
