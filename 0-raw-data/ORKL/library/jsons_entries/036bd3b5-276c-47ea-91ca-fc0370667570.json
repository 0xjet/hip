Just months after the APT32 watering hole activity against ASEAN-related\nwebsites was observed in Fall 2017, this new activity clearly indicates the association (ASEAN)\nclearly remains a priority collection target in the region. This new Lotus Blossom campaign\n[delivers a malicious RTF document posing as an ASEAN Defence Minister's Meeting (ADMM)](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2F%23%2Ffile%2Fd3fc69a9f2ae2c446434abbfbe1693ef0f81a5da0a7f39d27c80d85f4a49c411%2Fdetection)\ndirectory (decoy) that also carries an executable (payload) embedded as an OLE object, the Elise\nbackdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Elise backdoor is not new malware and has been successfully diagnosed in the past by\n[Industry researchers (e.g. Palo Alto Unit 42's 2015 report) and more recently](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paloaltonetworks.com%2Fapps%2Fpan%2Fpublic%2FdownloadResource%3FpagePath%3D%2Fcontent%2Fpan%2Fen_US%2Fresources%2Fresearch%2Funit42-operation-lotus-blossom)\n[by Volexity and Accenture. Each of these are valuable resources to understanding the Elise](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.volexity.com%2Fblog%2F2017%2F11%2F06%2Foceanlotus-blossoms-mass-digital-surveillance-and-exploitation-of-asean-nations-the-media-human-rights-and-civil-society%2F)\nmalcode, infection process, and known capabilities of the backdoor. In addition, a\n[current ANY.RUN playback of our observed Elise infection is also available.](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.any.run%2Ftasks%2F05b68865-529e-44e4-882f-0c184b162f12)\n\n[Upon opening of the MS Word document, our embedded file exploits CVE-2017-11882 to drop a](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvedetails.com%2Fcve%2Fcve-2017-11882)\n[malicious fake Norton Security Shell Extension module, 'NavShExt.dll', which is then injected into](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2F%23%2Ffile%2F6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79%2Fdetection)\niexplore.exe to install the backdoor, begin collection, and activate command and control.\n\nMoving through the infection process, NetWitness Endpoint detects the initial exploit (CVE-20171182) in action as the Microsoft Equation Editor, 'EQNEDT32.exe', scores high for potentially\nmalicious activity. This same process was also flagged in our any.run playback.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Our malware then spins up an instance of 'iexplore.exe' and injects 'NavShExt.dll' into that](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2F%23%2Ffile%2F6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79%2Fdetection)\nprocess.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this is happening, the malware establishes persistence by creating an autorun in the\nregistry and then also creates 'thumbcache_1CD60.db' at\n'Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer\\' to store harvested data.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAs the infection process completes, we now observe Elise network activity (e.g., exfil of victim\ndata and C2) through a conveniently hidden instance of Internet Explorer.\n\nThis traffic was also observed in NetWitness Packets, as the malware verifies the host IP\n[address prior to kicking off C2 out to 103.236.150[.]14, which is likely compromised](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.riskiq.com%2Fsearch%2F103.236.150.14)\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nTake note of the cookie set in this HTTP POST, because Lotus Blossom actors go to significant\nlengths to protect this data via both B64 encoding and AES encryption. The actual C2 for Elise\ntakes place over \"cookie\" code and (rarely) body content.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nOther infections (from the identical payload) each generated their own decoy domains to\npopulate the host header, but in every case actually used the same hard-coded IP\n[address, 103.236.150[.]14.](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.riskiq.com%2Fsearch%2F103.236.150.14)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAfter our Elise infection had run for about a day, we were visited by the threat actor. While it's\nunclear exactly what the actor may have been looking for, our infected (sandboxed) machine\nwas not it and the backdoor was deleted.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on both previous activity and this current Lotus Blossom campaign, it is clear that we\nare witnessing the continued rise of cyber tradecraft and activity from nation-states in\nthe Southeast Asian theater.\n\n[Thanks to Kent Backman, Justin Lamarre, and Ahmed Sonbol for their assistance with this](https://community.rsa.com/people/Gl8LOTl4A2rCbPZkifuse3cHH75XbzVWfnhIYrQRH4A=)\nresearch.\n\nThe following samples were used for this analysis:\n\nMalicious RTF\nDropper (SHA256): d3fc69a9f2ae2c446434abbfbe1693ef0f81a5da0a7f39d27c80d85f4a49c411\n[NavShExt.dll (SHA256): 6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2F%23%2Ffile%2F6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79%2Fdetection)\n\n\n-----",
