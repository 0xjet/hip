It was\nobserved appearing for sale around 10/20/2016. According to the malware authors post on\nunderground forums it has the ability to steal various passwords, cookies, bitcoin wallets,\nRDP and FTP saved connections, and can even grab specified files. At the time of this\nwriting the latest version can steal data from the following applications:\n\n**Browsers:**\n\nMozilla FireFox\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\nComodo IceDragon\n\nVivaldi Browser\n\nMail.Ru Browser\n\nTorch Browser\n\nDooble Browser\n\n\n-----\n\nU Browser\nCoowon\nAmigo Browser\nBromium\nYandex Browser\nOpera Browser\nChromium\nSRWare Iron\nCoolNovo Browser\nRockMelt Browser\n\n**FTP Clients:**\nFileZilla\nCoreFTP\nCuteFTP\nSmartFTP\nWinSCP\nTotal Commander\n\n**Email Clients:**\nMS Outlook <= 2013\n\nMozilla Thunderbird\n\n**IM Clients:**\nWindows Live\nPidgin\nPsi\n\n**Bitcoin Wallets:**\nwallet.dat\n\n**RDP remote connection files**\n\n**Any specified files/documents**\n\nHere is a look at the admin panel of this malware:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware has been observed being delivered in malspam emails that have word\ndocument attachments. It is the typical phishing type email that entices the user to open the\nattachment. The word documents contain VBA that will use powershell to download the\nmalware payload from a remote URL where it is encoded into a byte array in the webpage. It\nis then programmed to load the byte array and decode it with an exclusive or (XOR) and call\nthe main function from the loaded executable.\n\nThis post is geared more towards the binary analysis of the August malware, but the great\npeople over at Proofpoint have done a fantastic job on an overview of the threat - you can\n[read it on their blog here. So let's continue with our analysis.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/august-in-december-new-information-stealer-hits-the-scene)\n\nRunning the strings command on files can often give you quite a bit of interesting information\nregarding the sample you are analyzing. You have to be careful though, because strings can\nsometimes be misleading as malware authors can put junk strings in to confuse analysis -remember to validate anything you find. Here are a few of the interesting strings I found in\nthis sample:\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can see that there appears to be some strings related to crypto functions, encryption,\ndecryption, HTTP functions, and even some anti-debugging. There are many, many more but\nwe have to consolidate for the post. One of the more interesting items is the strings\n'ConfusedByAttribute' and 'Confuser v1.9.0.0'.\n\nConfuser is a packer / obfuscation tool for .NET applications. It offers a variety of obfuscation\nmethods such as anti-debugging, anti-memory dumping, anti-decompiling, encrypting\nconstants, methods, and resources, etc.\n\nWhen analyzing an unknown binary it is always good to verify what type of file you are\ndealing with. PEiD shows that this is a .NET executable designed for 32 bit computers.\n\n\n-----\n\nDiE (detect it easy) is another good tool to analyze exe files, especially if you think it might\nbe packed. Looking at our sample it shows again that this is a .NET executable and it was\ndesigned for 32 bit. It also shows that this sample was packed with Confuser v1.9.0.0 - just\nlike we saw in our strings.\n\nIt is good practice to not just rely on a single source of information, but to verify with multiple\nsources. CFF Explorer is one of my favorite apps for analyzing binary files because it gives\nyou so much detailed information. Looking at this in CFF shows much of the same.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe see that the File Type is listed as a Portable Executable 32 .NET Assembly and File Info\nshows Microsoft Visual Studio .NET. So we are probably dealing with a .NET file... but let's\ndo a little more analysis just to make sure. Do not pay attention to the\ncreated/modified/access times as these are when this binary was copied to the windows\nanalysis computer... remember windows MAC time rules.\n\nThe Dos Header shows the 4D5A MZ magic number indicating that this is an executable file.\n\nChecking the Optional Header info we can see the 2 byte value 010B (PE32) indicating that\nit is designed as a 32 bit application.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the Data Directories section, under NT Headers -> Optional Header, we can see that .NET\nMetaData Directory RVA & Size on the right details page both contain values. These are\ngood indications that we are indeed dealing with a .NET executable.\n\nOne last thing to verify - .NET files only have 1 import and 1 function imported. Here we see\nmscoree.dll and _CorDllMain, respectfully:\n\nWe can now confidently say that we are dealing with a .NET executable file.\nThere are a couple of other items of interest that we will take a look at. The exe compile\ndatetime that shows the date and time the project was compiled from VisualStudio. This can\neasily be changed by anyone with a little knowledge. The compile time for this binary shows\nthe following\n\nWhich converted becomes\n\nGiven other indicators going on for this around the same time, confidence is pretty high that\nthe compile time is legit. The other item of interest is the module directory that shows the\n\n\n-----\n\nname of this file at compile time. Because anyone can rename a file at anytime, this entry will\noften show the original name of the file the malware author had set at the time it was\ncompiled. Here we see it was indeed called 'August@.dll'\n\nNow that we know we are dealing with a .NET file, we can open it up in a decompiler and\nsee what we get.\n\nAll of the methods and assemblies are encrypted by the Confuser packer that was identified\nearlier.\n\nLooks like we're going to have to decrypt it first before analyzing. For this we can use a\nprogram called NoFuser to help with decryption. Running our binary through NoFuser shows\nthat it detected Confuser v1.9 as well and successfully cleaned our binary.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow open it back up in side the decompiler and we should have readable data.\n\nMoving into the Main() method, because this is where code execution starts, we see that\nright away the malware hides itself by setting the FileAttribute to 'Hidden'.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext it has functions to check whether there are analysis programs currently running as\nprocesses, and will sleep for 20000ms if it finds any (roughly 30 seconds).\n\n<-snip->\n\nIt then gathers some information about the computer that it has just infected, such as the\ntype of CPU, amount of RAM, networking info, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also grabs the username of the person currently logged in\n\nIt then encrypts the data and sends it to the pre-programmed C2 server via the following web\nrequest\n\nWe can see that it is using a POST method and has a timeout value set to 100000ms. The\nC2 URL value is completely configurable and will change from sample to sample.\n\nAfter checking in with its C2 the malware immediately begins its data exfiltration routines.\nChecking through the code shows functions for all the data exfil types listed at the beginning\nof this post. I will not list all of the code here for brevity sake.\n\nAll-in-all this is a pretty interesting sample. I am still analyzing and learning more about it, but\nI think that about wraps it up for this post!\n\n[The sample analyzed in this post was found on hybrid-analysis over here.](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/c725e62b5aa3dfbf41b979bb55b04d43fa7042ca34cb914892872267e79de8d1?environmentId=100&lang=en)\n\nFiletype PE32 executable (DLL) (console) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS\nWindows\n\n\n-----\n\nMimetype application/x-dosexec\n\nSize 102912\n\nMD5 11c445c509f6a86fde366076502f085a\n\nSHA1 47edb81b7ab25a632c6d2911581e800f700208b2\n\nSHA256 c725e62b5aa3dfbf41b979bb55b04d43fa7042ca34cb914892872267e79de8d1\n\n\n-----",
