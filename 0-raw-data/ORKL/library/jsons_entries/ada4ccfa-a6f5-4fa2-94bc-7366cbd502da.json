Among the systems that had data encrypted during the incident were the company's web servers.\n\nSigns of the incident are still visible online. Encrypted files and ransom notes are still cached in Google search results, even a week after the\ncompany took down the impacted web servers.\n\n\n-----\n\newa ransomware.png\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nSecurity researchers who reviewed the cached files told ZDNet the encrypted files and ransom note are, without a doubt, a sign of an infection\nwith the Ryuk ransomware.\n\nThe security researcher who first discovered these files told ZDNet that several EWA websites appear to have been impacted, such as the\nsites for:\n\nEWA Government Systems Inc. -- an EWA subsidiary that provides electronic warfare (EW) products and services to government and\ncommercial markets in cyber defense, radar development, intelligence, security, training, tactical mission planning, information\nmanagement, and force protection.\nEWA Technologies Inc. -- an EWA subsidiary specialized in JTAG products.\nSimplicikey -- an EWA subsidiary specialized in the manufacturing a consumer-focused Remote Control Electronic Deadbolt.\nHomeland Protection Institute -- a non-profit chaired by the EWA CEO.\n\nIt is unclear at the moment how much of the company's internal network was encrypted during the incident.\n\n\n-----\n\nesp te s b e s g s o a a so a e c de t o ts pub c ebs tes, as ot ssued a y pub c state e t about t e c de t\n\nAn EWA spokesperson hung up the phone earlier today when ZDNet reached out for comment about the security breach.\n\n[The company is a well-known supplier of electronics equipment to the US government. On its website, EWA lists the Department of Defense](https://www.ewa.com/customers/)\n(DOD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as regular customers.\n\n## A conspicuous Ryuk Stealer update\n\nMaking matters worse is that Ryuk is not your regular ransomware strain. This type of ransomware is solely used in targeted attacks on highprofile companies.\n\nIt is usually installed on infected networks after a victim is infected with the Emotet/TrickBot trojans, two well-known cybercrime-as-a-service\nplatforms.\n\nThe Ryuk gang uses the Emotet/TrickBot-infected machine as entry point and launch pad to scan and spread inside a company's internal\nnetwork, exfiltrate data, and then deploy their ransomware.\n\nThe data exfiltration happens via a Ryuk module called the Ryuk Stealer, which security researchers have been spotting deployed in recent\nRyuk attacks.\n\nCoincidentally, the Ryuk Stealer was recently update to target files that may hold government and military-related data, according to a Bleeping\nComputer report, suggesting a concerted effort on the Ryuk gang's side in targeting government and military entities.\n\n**The FBI's most wanted cybercriminals**\n\n\n-----",
