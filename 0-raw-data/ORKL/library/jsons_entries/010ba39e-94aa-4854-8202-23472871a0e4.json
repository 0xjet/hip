Borchi/Getty Images.)\nAs the news about Russia’s broad digital espionage operation against the U.S. Defense,\nTreasury, and Commerce Departments, nuclear laboratories, and other governmental\nsystems grows more ominous, prominent voices are calling for a vigorous response. “[A]ll\nelements of national power,” including military power, “must be placed on the table,”\nproclaimed Thomas Bossert, the former senior cybersecurity adviser in the Trump\nadministration, in a New York Times [op-ed. The United States must “reserve [its] right to](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/opinion/fireeye-solarwinds-russia-hack.html)\nunilateral self-defense,” and “allies must be rallied to the cause” since such coalitions will be\n“important to punishing Russia and navigating this crisis without uncontrolled escalation.”\nSen. Richard Durbin had a similar but pithier assessment: “This is virtually a declaration of\nwar by Russia on the United States.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe lack of self-awareness in these and similar reactions to the Russia breach is\nastounding. The U.S. government has no principled basis to complain about the Russia\nhack, much less retaliate for it with military means, since the U.S. government hacks foreign\ngovernment networks on a huge scale every day. Indeed, a military response to the Russian\nhack would violate international law. The United States does have options, but none are\nterribly attractive.\n\nThe news reports have emphasized that the Russian operation thus far appears to be purely\none of espionage—entering systems quietly, lurking around, and exfiltrating information of\ninterest. Peacetime government-to-government espionage is as old as the international\nsystem and is today widely practiced, especially via electronic surveillance. It can cause\nenormous damage to national security, as the Russian hack surely does. But it does not\nviolate international law or norms.\n\nAs the revelations from leaks of information from Edward Snowden made plain, the United\nStates regularly penetrates foreign governmental computer systems on a massive scale,\noften (as in the Russia hack) with the unwitting assistance of the private sector, for purposes\nof spying. It is almost certainly the world’s leader in this practice, probably by a lot. The\nSnowden documents suggested as much, as does the NSA’s probable budget. In 2016, after\nnoting “problems with cyber intrusions from Russia,” Obama boasted that the United States\nhas “more capacity than anybody … offensively.”\n\nBecause of its own practices, the U.S. government has traditionally accepted the legitimacy\nof foreign governmental electronic spying in U.S. government networks. After the notorious\nChinese hack of the Office of Personnel Management database, then-Director of National\nIntelligence James Clapper said: “You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did. If\nwe had the opportunity to do that, I don't think we'd hesitate for a minute.” The same Russian\nagency that appears to have carried out the hack revealed this week also hacked into\nunclassified emails in the White House and Defense and State Departments in 2014-2015.\nThe Obama administration deemed it traditional espionage and did not retaliate. “It was\ninformation collection, which is what nation states—including the United States—do,” said\nObama administration cybersecurity coordinator Michael Daniel this week.\n\nSome argue that it is time to end this accepting attitude. This seems to be President-elect\nJoe Biden’s view. “A good defense isn’t enough; we need to disrupt and deter our\nadversaries from undertaking significant cyberattacks in the first place,” he said yesterday.\nBut this is much easier said than done, even beyond the hypocrisy in punishing others for\ndoing to us what we do to them. The main lawful options—economic sanctions, criminally\ncharging and trying to arrest those involved, recruiting adversary hackers, and the like—have\nbeen tried for years in related contexts, and failed to stop the digital carnage. Anything more\nthan these rather modest retaliatory steps threatens an escalatory response by the Russians\nthat might leave the United States—deeply dependent on weakly defended digital networks\n—in a more vulnerable position. This in a nutshell is why the Obama administration was so\nparalyzed in responding to various cyber intrusions\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Trump administration overcame these worries and asserted a more aggressive posture\nthat is called “Defend Forward.” The basic idea is that U.S. Cyber Command will maintain a\npersistent presence in adversary governmental networks so that it can “confront our\nadversaries from where they launch cyber attacks,” as NSA Director Paul Nakasone put it.\nDefend Forward was deemed a success in preventing interference in the 2018 and 2020\nelections. But it utterly failed to even detect the recent Russia hack. It is not hard to see why.\nEven Cyber Command has limited resources. It cannot monitor, detect and prevent all\npossible major cyber threats.\n\nBut there are other problems with Defend Forward as a potential response to the Russia\nhack. It requires the United States to do the very thing it is trying in part to prevent—massive\nspying inside government networks. And it requires an additional and more controversial\nstep beyond mere espionage: disruption of the adversary system to stop the attack before it\nsucceeds. In 2018, this involved shutting down the Russian Internet Research Agency’s\ninternet access.\n\nThis additional step is legally much more contestable than mere espionage. And more\nimportantly, now that the United States has widely touted this practice, nothing in principle\nprevents other countries from engaging in analogous disruptions in our systems following\nextended espionage. Some worry that the Russian presence in U.S. networks “might allow\nthem to conduct destructive attacks or change data inside government systems.” But this is\nvery much like what Defend Forward purports to do in order to prevent attacks on the United\nStates.\n\nThe United States has spent “billions of dollars to assemble the world’s most potent arsenal\nof cyberweapons and plant them in networks around the world,” as the New York Times\n[reported last year. It also reported that that as part of Defend Forward, the United States had](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/middleeast/iran-cyberattack-us.html)\ndeployed “potentially crippling malware” inside the Russian electric grid and other Russian\ncomputer systems, “at a depth and with an aggressiveness that had never been tried\nbefore,” in order to warn and deter the Russians for meddling in our computer systems. This\neffort at deterrence appears not to have worked, but it highlights the dangers of Defend\nForward. The United States and Russia have been involved in escalating tit-for-tat cyber\noperations against one another for a long time. Perhaps this year’s Russians hack is in part a\nresponsive “defend forward” operation to warn and deter the United States from further\naction. It is hard to know where we are in the retaliatory cycle, but it is pretty clear that the\nUnited States has more to lose from escalating retaliation.\n\nThe larger context here is that for many reasons—the Snowden revelations, the infamous\ndigital attack on Iranian centrifuges (and other warlike uses of digital weapons), the U.S.\n“internet freedom” program (which subsidizes tools to circumvent constraints in authoritarian\nnetworks), Defend Forward, and more—the United States is widely viewed abroad as the\nmost fearsome global cyber bully. From our adversaries’ perspective, the United States uses\nits prodigious digital tools, short of war, to achieve whatever advantage it can, and so\nadversaries feel justified in doing whatever they can as well often with fewer scruples We\n\n\n-----\n\ncan tell ourselves that our digital exploits in foreign governmental systems serve good ends,\nand that our adversaries’ exploits in our systems do not, and often that is true. But this moral\njudgment, and the norms we push around it, have had no apparent influence in tamping\ndown our adversaries’ harmful attacks on our networks—especially since the U.S. approach\nto norms has been to give up nothing that it wants to do in the digital realm, but at the same\ntime to try to cajole, coerce, or shame our adversaries into not engaging in digital practices\nthat harm the United States.\n\nDespite many tens of billions of dollars spent on cyber defense and deterrence and Defend\nForward prevention, and despite one new strategy after another, the United States has failed\nmiserably for decades in protecting its public and private digital networks. What it apparently\nhas not done is to ask itself, in a serious way, how its aggressive digital practices abroad\ninvite and justify digital attacks and infiltrations by our adversaries, and whether those\npractices are worth the costs. Relatedly, it has not seriously considered the traditional third\n[option when defense and deterrence fail in the face of a foreign threat: mutual](https://www.lawfareblog.com/contrarian-thoughts-russia-and-presidential-election) [restraint,](https://www.lawfareblog.com/russian-proposal-mutual-noninterference-domestic-politics)\nwhereby the United States agrees to curb certain activities in foreign networks in exchange\nfor forbearance by our adversaries in our networks. There are many serious hurdles to\nmaking such cooperation work, including precise agreement on each side’s restraint, and\nverification. But given our deep digital dependency and the persistent failure of defense and\ndeterrence to protect our digital systems, cooperation is at least worth exploring.\n\n_Jack Goldsmith is Henry L.
