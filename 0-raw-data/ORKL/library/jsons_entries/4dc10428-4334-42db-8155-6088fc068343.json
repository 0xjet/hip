We have also shown that you can start with the State and work backwards to\nthe APT.\n\nAPT groups in China have a common blueprint: contract hackers and specialists, front\ncompanies, and an intelligence officer. We know that multiple areas of China each have their\nown APT.\n\nAfter a long investigation we now know that it is possible to take a province and identify front\ncompanies, from those companies identify individuals who work there, and then connect\nthese companies and individuals to an APT and the State.\n\n**Hainan Province**\n\n\n-----\n\nOur previous research showed that science and technology companies Boyusec, Huaying\nHaitai, Antorsoft, and others were fronts for Chinese MSS-sponsored APT activity. If you take\nthe blueprint above and search for it elsewhere, an interesting and increasingly bizarre series\nof links begin to emerge.\n\nNorthern China has received much, presumably unwelcome, attention from this blog already.\nFor our next example, let’s look South, as far South as we can while remaining in China.\nHainan – a semi-tropical island paradise conveniently located for Chinese tourists, known for\nits production of rubber and iron ore, its rocket launches, and its views over the South China\nSea. What it is not internationally famous for, is global technology companies.\n\n**Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Company**\n\nSearch for science and technology companies in Hainan who have also posted job adverts\nfor penetration testers and you will quickly find 海南仙盾科技开发有限公司, the Hainan\nXiandun Technology Development Company. A [job advert for a penetration tester position at](http://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1063/4213.htm)\nHainan Xiandun posted on the the Sichuan University Faculty of Computer Science website\non 5 January 2018 describes Hainan Xiandun as a “fast-growing high-tech information\nsecurity company”.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAdvert for Hainan Xiandun\n[Here is a second advert for the same company from the College of Foreign Languages at](https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/stm/waiguoyu_XG/2014325/10379000.shtml)\nHainan University advertising for female English translators, ideally party members:\n\nSecond advert for Hainan Xiandun\nHowever, multiple other technology companies based in Hainan use identical company\ndescriptions and job adverts.\n\n**Hainan Yili** **Technology Company**\n\nHainan Yili – 海南毅立科技有限公司 – [describes itself as a fast growing, high-tech](https://www.yingjiesheng.com/job-003-419-059.html)\ninformation security company which is committed to becoming a leading manufacturer of\ninformation security products and services in China.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAdvert for Hainan Yili Technology Co Ltd\n**Hainan Tengyuan Technology Company**\n\nHainan Tengyuan – 海南腾远科技有限公司 – also describes itself as a fast growing, hightech information security company which is committed to becoming a leading manufacturer\nof information security products and services in China.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Hainan Kehua Information Technology Company**\n\nAnd that’s not all. Hainan Kehua – 海南科华信息科技有限公司 – [also describes itself as a](http://old.job.hncst.edu.cn/view_1203.html)\nfast growing, high-tech information security company which is committed to becoming a\nleading manufacturer of information security products and services in China.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Hainan Yanwu Technology Development Company**\n\n[A little more research uncovers Hainan Yanwu – 海南彦武科技开发有限公司 – a company](https://jobs.51job.com/all/co3638484.html)\nwhich also describes itself as a fast growing, high-tech information security company which\nhas become a leading provider of information security services in China.\n\nOf course, this could all be a coincidence. Perhaps this company description is the first result\non Baidu for “how should I describe my new technology company”. But it isn’t.\n\n\n-----\n\n**More links emerge**\n\n[More links are evident in these job adverts. A Hainan Xiandun advert for an English](http://www.hainu.edu.cn/stm/waiguoyu_XG/2017328/10475388.shtml)\ntranslator lists 3414477607[at]qq.com as the contact email.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nHainan Xiandun advert showing 18976445013 and 341447767@qq.com\n[This is the same email address that was seen on the advert for a Network Security](https://www.yingjiesheng.com/job-003-419-059.html)\nDevelopment Engineer for Hainan Yili above:\n\nHainan Yili advert (crop of above) showing 18976445013 and 341447767@qq.com\nThere are more links; the contact person Wang Tian (王天) from the job advert above can\n[also be seen on this advert for Hainan Tengyuan:](https://www.yjbys.com/company/7452390.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Eight other linked technology companies in Hainan**\n\nFive companies with overlapping contact details, job and company profiles, and named\nindividuals. This is a little suspicious, but there might remain a chance that it is all completely\nexplainable. Thirteen companies though starts to move beyond even the broadest realms of\ncredulity and positive thinking. Taking the registration details for Hainan Tengyuan we can\nthen find a further eight linked technology companies in Hainan.\n\nRegistration details for Hainan Tengyuan showing phone number and address at 10 Haixiu\nRoad\n\nCompany 6: Hainan Dingwei Digital Technology Company shares a telephone number\nand address with Hainan Tengyuan – 19808984669 and No. 10 Haixiu Road\nCompany 7: Haikou Fengshang Digital Technology Company shares a telephone\nnumber and address with Hainan Tengyuan and Hainan Dingwei.\nCompany 8: Hainan Hualian Anshi Intelligence Engineering Company shares a\ntelephone number and address with Hainan Tengyuan, Hainan Dingwei, Haikou\nFengshang.\nCompany 9: Hainan Jiaxi Technology Company shares a telephone number and\naddress with Hainan Tengyuan, Hainan Dingwei, Haikou Fengshang, and Hainan\nHualian Anshi.\nCompany 10: Hainan Xinhuaheng Technology Company shares a telephone number\n(19808984***) with Hainan Tengyuan, Hainan Dingwei, Haikou Fengshang, Hainan\nHualian Anshi, and Hainan Jiaxi and and is co-located in the same building.\nCompany 11: Haikou Jianhui Li Network Technology Company shares a shareholder\nwith Hainan Xiandun (Fu Chuanli – 符传礼).\nCompany 12: Hainan Xin Yousheng Digital Technology Company shares a legal\nrepresentative and shareholder with Hainan Dingwei (Fu Zhidao – 符致道 and Wu\nChunai – 吴春爱), shares a telephone number with Hainan Tengyuan, and is also\nlocated at No. 10 Haixiu Road.\n\n\n-----\n\nCompany 13: Haikou Xindahai Computer Technology Company shares a shareholder\nwith Hainan Hualian Anshi and Hainan Jiaxi (Fu Deqing – 符德清 and Wu Li – 吴丽）\nand is also located at No. 10 Haixiu Road.\n\n**Hainan cover companies recruiting for offensive cyber skills**\n\nLooking beyond the linked contact details though, some of the skills that these adverts are\nseeking are on the aggressive end of the spectrum. While the companies stress that they are\ncommitted to information security and cyber-defence, the technical job adverts that they have\nplaced seek skills that would more likely be suitable for red teaming and conducting cyberattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt could be argued that SQL injection and other penetration skills could be used for defensive\npurposes, to stress test defences for example. But [this job advert posted by Hainan](https://wenku.baidu.com/view/bfd6938505a1b0717fd5360cba1aa81144318fe7.html)\nTengyuan is also looking for someone with a track record of sharing hacking exploits as well\nas specific experience with Windows Trojan shellcode development and PE encryption. The\nquestion we should be asking is: who develops their own encrypted executable files?\n\n**In summary, we have multiple companies with identical descriptions and job adverts,**\n**overlapping contact details and office locations, but different names, recruiting for**\n**offensive hacking skills. Like Boyusec, Huaying Haitai, Antorsoft, and others, these**\n**companies have very little presence on the Internet outside of these adverts.**\n\n**We know that these companies are a front for APT activity.**\n\n**You all know where this story is going, and in the next articles we will show you some**\n**of we got there…**\n\n\n-----",
