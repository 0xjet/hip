These convincing profiles\nform a self-referenced network of seemingly established LinkedIn users. CTU researchers assess with high\nconfidence the purpose of this network is to target potential victims through social engineering. Most of the legitimate\nLinkedIn accounts associated with the fake accounts belong to individuals in the Middle East, and CTU researchers\nassess with medium confidence that these individuals are likely targets of TG-2889.\n\n## Fake LinkedIn accounts\n\nThe 25 fake LinkedIn accounts identified by CTU researchers fall into two categories: fully developed personas\n(Leader) and supporting personas (Supporter). The table in the Appendix lists details associated with the accounts.\nThe level of detail in the profiles suggests that the threat actors invested substantial time and effort into creating and\nmaintaining these personas. The photos used in the fake accounts are likely of innocent individuals who have no\nconnection to TG-2889 activity.\n\n### Leader personas\n\nProfiles for Leader personas include full educational history, current and previous job descriptions, and, sometimes,\nvocational qualifications and LinkedIn group memberships. Of the eight Leader personas identified by CTU\nresearchers, six have more than 500 connections (see Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Example Leader LinkedIn profile created by TG-2889. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe results of open-source research conducted by CTU researchers provided compelling evidence that the Leader\nprofiles were fraudulent:\n\nOne of the profile photographs is linked to multiple identities across numerous websites, including adult sites.\nThe summary section in one profile is identical to the summary in a legitimate LinkedIn profile, and the\nemployment history matches a sample résumé downloaded from a recruitment website.\nIn another profile, a job description was copied from genuine Teledyne and ExxonMobil job advertisements.\nThe job description in yet another profile (see Figure 2) was copied from a legitimate job posting from a\nMalaysian bank (see Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Job description from Leader persona profile. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n_Figure 3. Malaysian bank job posting matching a job description associated with a fake Leader LinkedIn profile._\n_(Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nFive of the Leader personas purport to work for Teledyne, an American industrial conglomerate. In addition, one\nclaims to work for Doosan (an industrial conglomerate based in South Korea), one for Northrop Grumman (a U.S.\naerospace and defense company), and one for Petrochemical Industries Co., (a Kuwaiti petrochemical manufacturing\ncompany).\n\n### Supporter personas\n\nProfiles for Supporter personas are far less developed than for Leader personas. They all use the same basic\ntemplate with one simple job description, and they all have five connections (see Figure 4). Profile photographs for\nthree of the Supporter personas appear elsewhere on the Internet, where they are associated with different,\nseemingly legitimate, identities. As with the Leader profiles, open-source research indicates that the Supporter\nprofiles are also fake.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Example Supporter LinkedIn profile created by TG-2889. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n### Building credibility via endorsements\n\nThe purpose of the Supporter personas appears to be to provide LinkedIn skills endorsements for Leader personas,\nlikely to add legitimacy to the Leader personas. As shown in Figure 5, most of the Supporter accounts identified by\nCTU researchers have endorsed skills listed on the profiles of the Leader personas. Although unable to view Leader\npersonas' LinkedIn connections, CTU researchers suspect the threat actors use the Supporter accounts to provide\nthe Leader profiles with an established network, which also enhances credibility.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. TG-2889 uses Supporter accounts (gray) to endorse the skills of Leader personas (green). (Source: Dell_\n_SecureWorks)_\n\n### Novel technique\n\nAlthough CTU researchers identified eight Leader profiles, two appear to be duplicates that have different identities\nassociated with the same account. While CTU researchers were analyzing the profiles, the threat actors altered two\nof the Leader LinkedIn accounts. The original profile name and photograph were replaced with a new identity, and the\ncurrent job was updated: in one case replacing Teledyne with Northrup Grumman (see Figure 6) and in the second\nreplacing Teledyne with Airbus Group.\n\n_Figure 6. LinkedIn screenshots showing replacement of original Pamela McCoy persona with Christine Russell. The_\n_alphanumerical LinkedIn ID, a1/7b/955, remains the same. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nChanging personas associated with existing profiles was a clever exploitation of LinkedIn functionality because the\nnew identities inherit the network and endorsements from the previous identity. These attributes immediately make\nthe new personas appear established and credible, and the transition may prevent the original personas from being\noverexposed.\n\n## Targeting LinkedIn users\n\nCreating a network of seemingly genuine and established LinkedIn personas helps TG-2889 identify and research\npotential victims. The threat actors can establish a relationship with targets by contacting them directly, or by\ncontacting one of the target's connections. It may be easier to establish a direct relationship if one of the fake\npersonas is already in the target's LinkedIn network.\n\n\n-----\n\nFive of the Leader personas claim to be recruitment consultants, which would provide a pretext for contacting targets.\nTG-2889 likely uses spearphishing or malicious websites to compromise victims, and established trust relationships\nsignificantly increase the likelihood of these tactics being successful.\n\n### Targets\n\nSeemingly legitimate LinkedIn users have also endorsed Leader personas. Endorsements are granted by\nconnections, indicating that these legitimate users are part of the Leader personas' networks. Therefore, they are\nlikely TG-2889 targets. Examination of the profiles associated with the endorsements revealed 204 potential TG-2889\ntargets. As shown in Figure 7, most are based in the Middle East.\n\n_Figure 7. Legitimate endorsers of fake TG-2889 LinkedIn accounts by country. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nA quarter of the targets work in the telecommunications vertical; Middle Eastern and North African mobile telephony\nsuppliers feature heavily. A focus on these types of targets may indicate that TG-2889 is interested in acquiring data\nheld by these organizations or gaining access to the services they operate. A significant minority of identified targets\nwork for Middle Eastern governments and for defense organizations based in the Middle East and South Asia.\n\n## Attribution\n\nBased on strong circumstantial evidence, CTU researchers assess that TG-2889 is linked to the activity that Cylance\ndescribed in its December 2014 Operation CLEAVER [report. The report documented threat actors using malware](http://www.cylance.com/assets/Cleaver/Cylance_Operation_Cleaver_Report.pdf)\ndisguised as a résumé application that appeared to allow résumés to be submitted to the industrial conglomerate\nTeledyne. Cylance reported the use of the following domains, which reference companies associated with many of the\nfake LinkedIn profiles identified by CTU researchers:\n\nTeledyne-Jobs.com\nDoosan-Job.com\nNorthropGrumman.net\n\nCylance attributed the Operation CLEAVER activity to a threat group operating at least in part out of Iran. CTU\nresearchers have not uncovered any intelligence that contradicts this assessment. Furthermore, the strong focus\nsuggested by the endorsement analysis on targets from Arab states in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)\nregion is in line with the expected targeting behavior of a threat group operating out of Iran.\n\n## Ongoing threat\n\n\n-----\n\nUpdates to profile content such as employment history suggest that TG 2889 regularly maintains these fake profiles.\nThe persona changes and job alterations could suggest preparations for a new campaign, and the decision to\nreference Northrup Grumman and Airbus Group may indicate that the threat actors plan to target the aerospace\nvertical.\n\nIt is likely that TG-2889 maintains personas that have not yet been identified, and that other threat groups also use\nthis tactic. CTU researchers advise organizations to educate their users of the specific and general risks:\n\nAvoid contact with known fake personas.\nOnly connect to personas belonging to individuals they know and trust.\nAdopt a position of sensible caution when engaging with members of colleagues' or friends' networks that they\nhave not verified outside of LinkedIn.\nWhen evaluating employment offers originating from LinkedIn, seek confirmation that the individual is legitimate\nby directly contacting the individual's purported employer.\n\nOrganizations may want to consider policing abuse of their brand on LinkedIn and other social media sites. If an\norganization discovers that a LinkedIn persona is fraudulently claiming an association with the company, it should\ncontact LinkedIn. Creating false identities and misrepresenting an association with an organization is a breach of\nLinkedIn's terms and conditions.\n\n## Appendix — Fake LinkedIn personas created by TG-2889\n\nTable 1 lists details associated with Leader and Supporter personas created by TG-2889.
