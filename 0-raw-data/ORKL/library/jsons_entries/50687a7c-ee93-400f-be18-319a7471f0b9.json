In this article Thakur takes a deep drive into the technical aspects of a new\nAZORult variant that was found globally targeting computers. Those infected would have\nthe Aurora Ransomware installed as well as a information stealing Trojan.\n\nFor those who are interested in step-by-step look at the reverse engineering of a malware\nsample you will find this post very interesting\n\n\n-----\n\nTowards the end of July 2018, we saw a new version of the AZORult trojan being used in\nmalware campaigns targeting computers globally. In this article, we will dive into the\nmalware and analyze its execution flow and payloads.\n\nThe initial infection vector is a phishing email that comes with a downloader malware\nattached. On execution, it downloads and executes the main malware.\n\nThis version of the malware comes with two payloads. These are embedded in the main\nbinary and are simply dropped on to the disk and executed. The first payload to be\nexecuted is an information stealer that targets local accounts, browsers, saved credentials\netc (this is the AZORult part). The second payload is the Aurora ransomware.\n\nWe also identified the MalActor “Oktropys” running the Aurora ransomware campaign in this\ncase.\n\nThe main goal of this article is to analyze the malware from an incident response/threat\nneutralization point of view. We will try to understand the code structure and see if we are\nable to extract some useful IOCs from the binaries.\n\n## Analyzing the dropper\n\nLet’s start the analysis by looking at the main binary. As stated earlier, this binary comes\nwith the payloads embedded. You can simply extract these payloads by un-archiving the\nPE.\n\nTo unarchive the binary, we use the 7-Zip program as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see, we were able to dump the archived data into a folder. Step into the folder\ntwo levels and you’ll find the extracted folders:\n\nStep into the folder $1\n\nNow we step into the folder 1337 and find the embedded payloads:\n\n\n-----\n\nNow, instead of getting to the payloads directly, we ll follow the malware execution and see\nhow it is using these embedded payloads.\n\nLet’s start by taking a look at the main dropper. On execution, it loads a number of modules\nthat you can see in the image below.\n\n**A complete list of all modules loaded on execution**\n\n\n-----\n\nNow we’ll have a look at the interesting modules and their functions that are called on by\nthe malware.\n\nAs pointed out earlier, the malware drops two payloads. The first one to be dropped on\nexecution is AU3_EXE_2018–07–18_23–01.exe.\n\nAs you can see in the image below, function CreateFileA is used to create the file before the\nprocess is launched.\n\nNext step is to create the process:\n\nOnce the process is ready, it’s time to launch it by execution:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see in the image below, the process has now been launched.\n\nThe next step for the malware is to move on to the next payload. It follows a similar flow to\ncreate and launch the second payload.\n\nIt calls on the function CreateProcess:\n\nNext, it calls CreateProcessInternal, which will launch the process:\n\nAnd in the image below you can see the second payload has now been launched.\n\n**Both malicious**\n\n**process launched**\nNow that we know how the main binary loads and executes these payloads, it’s time to get\ninto the payloads and analyze them separately.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Payload #1: AZORult Stealer\n\nIn this section, we’ll take a look at the first payload, which is the AZORult Stealer. Let’s start\nby listing the modules that are loaded by the malware and then picking the ones that are of\ninterest to us.\n\n\n-----\n\n**A complete list of modules loaded by the malware on**\n\n**successful execution**\nNote that the above list of modules is the complete list and is only available after the\nprocess has loaded completely. As we start the analysis, this list should be considerably\nshorter.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware extracts some important information about the victim s computer. This\ninformation is then sent to the malware's C2.\n\nHere’s an example of the function GetUserName:\n\nAmong other things, the malware also tries to steal browser login data. The images below\nshow you the function call and stack values. We’ll look at some other information that is\ntargeted later in the article.\n\nIn order to connect to the C2, the process will now call on function InternetConnectURL and\nwe should be able to see the URL value being passed on to the stack. We can capture this\nIOC at this point:\n\nNext step is to canonicalize the URL so that it can be used over the wire for establishing a\nconnection to the C2:\n\n\n-----\n\nNext step is to call the proxy functions before the connection call is made.\nInternetInitializeAutoProxyDll refreshes the internal state of proxy configuration information\nfrom the registry.\n\nNow let’s take a quick look into the crypto functions that are called to encrypt the\ndata before it is sent back to C2.\n\nThe malware uses a couple of Crypto functions, but the code seems to be incomplete as\nsome major functions are not called/executed. No hash is generated/duplicated, the actual\ncryptEncrypt function is not called, key is not destroyed in the end and the context is not\nreleased. Crypto functions can still be executed the way they have been implemented in the\ncode but cannot be re-used without problems. It’ll be interesting to see if the authors are\ntrying to move towards full AES encryption for future releases as we saw in the case of\nEmotet.\n\n**[CryptAcquireContext](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptacquirecontexta)**\n\n[This function is called on to get the cryptographic service provider (CSP).](https://msdn.microsoft.com/db46def4-bfdc-4801-a57d-d568e94a2dbb)\n\nThe provider is returned and passed on to the stack as a variable:\n\nThe returned value is dumped into the memory space:\n\n\n-----\n\n**CryptGenRandom**\n\nNow, the next function, CryptGenRandom is called so that a random key can be generated.\n\nThe networking information is now passed on to the stack and then dumped into the\nmemory space. Please note that the data is in the little endian format.\n\n**Little**\n\n**Endian**\nThe malware also reads through the cookies that are available on the disk:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Location where the cookies are stored**\nExample of the bing.com cookie being accessed:\n\nThe malware now tries to send data back to the C2 using a POST request. This is how that\nrequest is constructed:\n\nThe values are passed into memory, step by step using the ‘memcpy’ function:\n\nAnd here’s the final request:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C2 responds with a base64 encoded string that outlines the information that the\nmalware tries to steal (Browsers, filePaths, fileNames etc).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Remarks**\n\nThe malware comes with loads of DLLs that are dumped in the directory:\nC:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\2fda\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter successful execution, the process spawns a cmd.exe, which in turns spawns a\ntimeout.exe. Both these process are benign.\n\n**Process flow after initial execution**\n\n## Payload #2: Aurora Ransomware\n\nThe second payload dropped by the malware dropper is the the Aurora ransomware. Upon\nsuccessful execution, it encrypts data on the victim’s computer and directs the victim to pay\n$150 using bitcoins.\n\nThe malware is a very basic ransomware and for that reason, we’ll only analyze the\nnetworking functions and try to the get the IOC from them.\n\nWhen executed, here is a list of modules loaded by this malware:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis ransomware is geo-targeted or at least it has that functionality built into it. To perform\ngeolocation it attempts to connect to a geo-location site and get the location of the victim\ncomputer. Here’s the call that is made for this purpose:\n\nAnd the script that runs on the server:\n\n[This script reaches out to MaxMind in the background and gets the geo-location of the](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)\nvictim computer. Here’s how that actually works:\n\nAt this time it looks like the MalActor is avoiding infections in Russia based on the georesult from the above functionality.\n\nAnd here’s the C2 information for the Aurora Ransomware:\n\n**Connection**\n\n**Initiation**\n\n\n-----\n\n**C2**\n\n**Connection**\nNow let’s take a quick look at the connections that are made to the C2 and how the\ninformation is passed in both directions.\n\nThe server uses a php script to generate a one-time public key, which is then used to\nencrypt the files on the disk. This key is created based on a computer ID that is generated\nbased on the local information extracted from the computer.\n\nThis malware uses ws2_32.dll for all networking operations. Look at the image below to see\nhow the connection is constructed:\n\nFirst the event is created:\n\nThe next step is to load it in memory:\n\nIP passed on to the stack\n\n\n-----\n\n**C2 IP loaded into the**\n\n**memory, ready to be passed into the registers**\nNow, the request is ready to be sent to the C2:\n\nAnd here’s the result with the generated key:\n\nNext, let’s take a look at the actual encryption process. As you can see in the image below,\nthe data is loaded into memory, then written to the files (over-written) to encrypt them:\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is an example of a file in process of being encrypted. This was achieved by inserting\ninterrupts on the function “memcpy” and then executing the process:\n\nAnd finally, this is the ransom note being written to the disk as a txt file:\n\nThe ransom being asked by this MalActor is $150. Here’s the ransom note:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Aurora Ransom Note**\nWe were able to get to the admin panel of the campaign, which is the back-end for the\nAurora ransomware. In this campaign, we can see that the MalActor running the campaign\nis someone called \"Oktropys\", who has been seen running ransomware campaigns in the\npast and has been quoted as ‘Oktropys ransomware’ in some publications, which is not\ncompletely accurate.\n\nAt this time there have been two transactions on the associated wallet.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAZORult trojan has been around for quite some time and has been successfully used by\ncriminals to steal critical personal information from their victims. The stolen passwords have\nbeen used widely to gain unauthorized access to bank accounts, email accounts and other\nonline applications.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis new version is another example of malware authors bundling in different payloads to\nmaximize the returns. In this case, they have included a ransomware and are asking for\n$150 for the decryption key, which is being managed by MalActor Oktropys.\n\nThe initial vector for this infection is an email campaign, that comes with a downloader\n(macro-based) that, on execution, downloads the malicious binary, which in turns drops two\nmalware payloads and infects the victim computers.\n\n## IOC\n\n**Network Traffic:**\n```\nhxxp://5.8.88.[]25/info.php?—?ransomware\nhxp://lulaaura[.]top/index.php?—?stealer\n\n```\n**HASHES**\n```\nMain Dropper: 09ffaa1523fbdceb7c0e6fa2be7221c161b5499dd45fc5dd4c210425fb333427\nStealer: 5151d9245858f3e28fa45f696421a49307436808d3ec18ff9e36f7876b0696d3\nRansomware: 41d35a960b3f28b1a729cdae920573de3ccefef7fdd3bbdb9d3ce729b6aa5277\n\n```\n[Aurora](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/aurora/)\n[AZORult](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/azorult/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Vishal Thakur](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/vishal-thakur/)\n\nVishal Thakur is a InfoSec researcher specializing in Incident Response and Malware\nAnalysis.
