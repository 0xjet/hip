state-sponsored espionage group that is also conducting financially motivated activity for personal gain.\n\n APT41 espionage operations against the healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors include establishing and maintaining strategic access, and through mid-2015, the theft of intellectual property.\n\n The group's operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.\n\n FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT41 carries out an array of financially motivated intrusions, particularly against the video game industry, including stealing source code and digital certificates, virtual currency manipulation, and attempting to deploy ransomware.\n\n APT41 has executed multiple software supply chain compromises, gaining access to software companies to inject malicious code into legitimate files before distributing updates.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\n\nFireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT41 is a prolific cyber\nthreat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to\nfinancially motivated activity potentially outside of state control. Activity traces back\nto 2012 when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated\noperations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely statesponsored activity. This is remarkable because explicit financially motivated targeting is\nunusual among Chinese state-sponsored threat groups, and evidence suggests these two\nmotivations were balanced concurrently from 2014 onward.\n\n- APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in that it leverages non-public\n\nmalware typically reserved for espionage operations in what appears to be activity that\nfalls outside the scope of state-sponsored missions.\n\n- Based on early observed activity, consistent behavior, and APT41's unusual focus on\n\nthe video game industry, we believe the group's cyber crime activities are most likely\nmotivated by personal financial gain or hobbyist interests.\n\nThis contrasts with the state-sponsored goals that likely drive the group's healthcare,\nhigh-tech, and politically related targeting.\n\n- We believe that APT41 is highly sophisticated and innovative. Its history of financially\n\nmotivated targeting of the video game industry has ultimately supported the group's\nstate-sponsored activity.\n\n- The group's distinct use of supply chain compromises to target select individuals,\n\nconsistent use of compromised digital certificates, and deployment of bootkits (rare\namong APT operators), highlight a creative and well-resourced adversary.\n\n- Some of the early operations driven by personal gain used techniques that would later\n\nbe pivotal in executing supply chain compromises.\n\n- Learning to access video game production environments enabled APT41 to develop the\n\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that were later leveraged against software\ncompanies to inject malicious code into software updates.\n\nAPT41 campaigns include most of the incidents previously attributed in FireEye Threat\nIntelligence reporting to GREF Team and a number of additional clusters that were\npreviously unnamed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Targeting\n\nLike other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 targets industries in a manner generally\naligned with China's Five-Year economic development plans. However, some campaigns\nattributed to APT41 indicate that the group is also deployed to gather intelligence ahead\nof imminent events, such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and political events.\nDirectly targeted verticals include:\n\n- Healthcare: including medical devices and diagnostics\n\n- High-tech: including semiconductors, advanced computer hardware, battery\n\ntechnology, and electric vehicles\n\n- Media: including news organizations\n\n- Pharmaceuticals\n\n- Retail\n\n- Software companies: which were compromised in supply chain operations\n\npotentially affecting large numbers of victims\n\n- Telecoms\n\n- Travel services\n\n- Education\n\n- Video games: including development studios, distributors/publishers,\n\nand activities enabling supply chain compromises\n\n- Virtual currencies: including in-game currencies, cryptocurrencies,\n\nand related services\n\nAPT41 has targeted organizations in 14 countries (and Hong Kong) over seven years,\nincluding: France, India, Italy, Japan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Singapore, South\nKorea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United\nStates (Figure 1). APT41 espionage operations against entities in these countries follow\ntargeting of verticals consistent with Chinese national policy priorities.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TARGETED IN 14 COUNTRIES\n\n**FIGURE 1.** Countries and industries targeted directly by APT41.\n\n\n**Industries Targeted**\n\n\nAutomotive Financial Pharmaceuticals\n\nBusiness Services Healthcare Retail\n\nCryptocurrency High-Tech Telecommunications\n\nEducation Intergovernmental Travel\n\nEnergy Media and Entertainment\n\n\n-----\n\n## Operations Over Time\n\nThe duality of APT41's state-sponsored activity and its own cyber crime operations\nis demonstrated in the group's simultaneous operations. Throughout the group’s\nobservable history, APT41 has consistently run its own financially motivated campaigns\nconcurrently with espionage operations. In contrast, APT41 espionage targeting\nhas changed significantly over time, suggesting shifts in assigned missions or new\ncontracts to complete. A breakdown of industries targeted by APT41 over time can be\nfound in Figure 2.\n\n- We believe that like other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 has moved\n\ntoward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access, but away\nfrom direct intellectual property theft. This shift, however, has not affected the\ngroup's consistent interest in targeting the video game industry for financially\nmotivated reasons.\n\n– We have not observed evidence of IP theft since late 2015.\n\n– In 2014, APT41 was observed carrying out espionage campaigns concurrently with\n\nfinancially motivated intrusions, demonstrating that they could balance different\nobjectives simultaneously.\n\n- Espionage operations occurred while the group was still carrying out financially\n\nmotivated campaigns, including longer-term intrusions, which typically extended\nfor more than a year.\n\n– In one instance, APT41 was attempting to steal data from a healthcare target while\n\nalso attempting to deploy ransomware at a video game studio.\n\n- Compromising organizations in different sectors concurrently provides some\n\nindication that they are fulfilling specific assigned tasks.\n\n– Campaigns have expanded into additional industries including telecoms, the\n\nautomotive sector, higher education, and travel services.\n\n– In 2015, we observed a time period in which eight organizations in six different\n\nindustries were compromised simultaneously.\n\n- Since 2017, APT41's activities have included a series of supply chain compromises.\n\nThe operation injects malware into legitimate server software packages used by\nhundreds of companies worldwide but limits deployment of additional payloads to\nselect targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 2.** Timeline of industries targeted by APT41.\n\n#### INDUSTRIES TARGETED BY APT 41\n\n\n#### 2012 2013\n\n\n#### 2014 2015\n\n\n#### 2017\n\nRetail\n\nTelecom\n\nHi-Tech\n\nMedia\n\nAutomotive\n\nSoftware\n\n\n#### 2018 2019\n\nVideo Game Video Game\n\nTelecom Telecom\n\nFinance Hi-Tech\n\nTravel\n\nHealthcare\n\nSoftware\n\n\nVideo Game\n\n\nVideo Game\n\nVideo Game\n\nRelated\n\nHi-Tech\n\n\nVideo Game\n\nVideo Game\n\nRelated\n\nHi-Tech\n\nIntergovernmental\n\nHealthcare\n\n\nVideo Game\n\nVideo Game\n\nRelated\n\nHi-Tech\n\nMedia\n\nHealthcare\n\nPharmaceutical\n\n\n#### 2016\n\nVideo Game\n\nVideo Game\n\nRelated\n\nHi-Tech\n\nMedia\n\nHealthcare\n\nEnergy\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cyber Espionage Activity\n\nObserved APT41 targeting is consistent with China's national\nstrategies to move production capabilities upmarket into\nresearch and development (R&D)-heavy fields. These initiatives\nwere especially highlighted with \"Made in China 2025,\" a plan\nannounced in 2015 that aims to shift China's economy toward\nhigher value products and services, including pharmaceuticals,\nsemiconductors, and other high-tech industries.\n\n- We assess that the targeting of high-tech firms that produce\n\ncomputer components aligns with Chinese interests in\ndomestically developing high-end technologies as outlined\nin the 12th (2011) and 13th (2016) Five-Year plans, as well as the\n**Made in China 2025 (2015) initiative.**\n\n– Since 2013, APT41 has targeted organizations involved in the\n\nresearch, development, and sale of computer components\nused for machine-learning, autonomous vehicles, medical\nimaging, and the consumer market. The group also targeted\ncompanies involved in producing motherboards, processors,\nand server solutions for enterprises.\n\n– In April 2013, the group targeted an enterprise cloud\ncomputing provider. Developing domestic cloud-computing\ntechnologies was a goal in the 12th Five-Year Plan.\n\n– In a 2014 compromise, APT41 targeted a European\n\nconglomerate and specifically focused on systems physically\nlocated in China.\n\n- The timing of multiple intrusions attributed to the group\n\nindicate a focused interest in strategic business decisions,\nincluding entry into the Chinese market, partnerships/M&A, and\nexpansion into other regional markets.\n\n– In October 2017, an intrusion into a retailer targeted strategic\n\ninvestment plans at the same time as the firm was beginning\nto negotiate a partnership with a Chinese company (although\nthis potential deal was not publicized).\n\n– In spring 2015, APT41 targeted information related to two\n\nentities undergoing a merger announced the previous year.\nThis included data related to a senior executive, as well as\npayroll and communications integration issues.\n\n\n\n- Since 2017, APT41 has consistently targeted\n\ntelecommunications companies, possibly a crucial first step to\nestablish a foothold in targeting a particular region.\n\n– Targeted telecom companies spanned several countries, and\n\nrecently identified intrusions were concentrated in countries\nwhere we had not identified any prior APT41 activity.\n\n– APT41 has targeted large telecom companies and their\n\nsubsidiaries in various locations, demonstrating consistent\ninterest in obtaining access to these targets.\n\n– The group has also repeatedly targeted call record\n\ninformation at telecom companies, supporting indications of\ntheir wider intelligence collection efforts.\n\nIn addition to specifically targeting industries of strategic value,\nwe suggest that APT41 is also given more tactical assignments,\nincluding reconnaissance and identifying dissidents.\n\n- A hotel was targeted two weeks ahead of a diplomatic visit in\n\nwhich high-ranking Chinese officials stayed there. Personal\ndata within the reservations system was directly accessed,\nsuggesting the group was potentially tasked to reconnoiter the\nfacility.\n\n- We assess with moderate confidence that APT41 gathered\n\nintelligence on pro-democracy dissidents in Hong Kong based\non the targets and timing of operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n– In July and August 2016, APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to\n\nHong Kong media organizations known for pro-democracy\neditorial content.\n\n– The timing and targeting of this activity suggests possible\n\ninterest in the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement\ncandidates who were running for seats in Hong Kong's\nlegislative council.\n\n– A spear-phishing email with the subject-line \"help\" was later\n\nsent to one of the previously targeted organizations\nin October 2017, coinciding with the sentencing of\npro-democracy Occupy activists. The ruling placed a\nfive-year ban on the activists from holding public offices\nin Hong Kong.\n\n**FIGURE 3.** MERS-themed lure document leveraging sexyjapan.ddns.info\nfor C&C (MD5: 5e87b09f9a3f1b728c9797560a38764b).\n\n\n– This was the first instance we have observed of APT41\n\ntargeting pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong.\n\nAPT41 frequently leverages timely news stories as the lure content\nin their spear-phishing emails, although social engineering\ncontent does not always correlate with targeted users or\norganizations.\n\n- In 2015, APT41 targeted a Japanese media organization with a\n\nlure document (Figure 3) titled “中東呼吸器症候群(MERS)の予\n防,” which translates to \"Prevention of Middle East Respiratory\nSyndrome (MERS).\" The fear of respiratory infections and a\npotential pandemic provide particularly effective lure material\nagainst targets in the Asia-Pacific region that had first-hand\nexperience with prior SARS and avian flu outbreaks.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CASE STUDY\n\n## Healthcare Sector Targeting\n\n###### APT41 activity aimed at medical device companies and pharmaceuticals is demonstrative of the group's capacity to collect sensitive and highly valuable intellectual property (IP), although we have not observed evidence of IP theft since late 2015. The healthcare sector was targeted in a manner that is highly specific and most likely indicative of focused taskings from sponsoring organizations with a stake in the healthcare market. Targeted information included pharmaceutical development, clinical trial data, and intelligence regarding a medical subsidiary's parent company.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe targeting of these organizations just ahead of the release of products requiring\na long R&D cycle can confer a significant market advantage to a competitor. The\nobserved activities are indicative of ongoing efforts to support China's own R&D\nefforts in support of Made in China 2025.\n\n- Between July 2014 and May 2016, APT41 targeted a medical devices subsidiary of\n\na large corporation.\n\n– Although APT41 initially targeted the parent company, 30 percent of the victimized\n\nhosts were related to a subsidiary specialized in manufacturing medical devices.\nPassword strings and spoofed domains leveraged in the operation signify a\nnarrow tasking to target the subsidiary instead of the\nparent corporation.\n\n– We have some indication based on the nature of hosts targeted that APT41 was\n\ninterested in information technology employees and software used by the medical\ndevice subsidiary.\n\n– A keylogger dubbed GEARSHIFT was first deployed at the medical device\n\ncompany. A digital certificate from the victim was compromised and used to\nsign malware used in an operation against a separate biotech company\ndetailed below.\n\n- A biotech company undergoing acquisition was targeted by APT41 in May 2015. Highly\n\nsensitive information about corporate operations, including human resources data,\ntax information, and acquisition-related documents, were targeted.\n\n– Clinical trials data of developed drugs, academic data, and R&D funding-related\n\ndocuments were exfiltrated.\n\n– The time frame, use of the same GEARSHIFT sample, and a digital certificate from\n\nthe aforementioned medical device company provide some indication that these\ntwo campaigns were conducted by the same operator concurrently.\n\n- In 2018, we observed APT41 target a third healthcare company, although their goals\n\nduring this compromise were unclear.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Financially Motivated Activity\n\nUnlike other observed Chinese espionage operators, APT41 conducts explicit financially\nmotivated activity, which has included the use of tools that are otherwise exclusively\nused in campaigns supporting state interests. The late-night to early morning activity\nof APT41's financially motivated operations suggests that the group primarily conducts\nthese activities outside of their normal day jobs. However, the group compiled malware\nfor use in cyber crime activity even during espionage-focused working hours.\n\n- As demonstrated in Figure 4, operational times for APT41 espionage operations over\n\nall observed activity are relatively close to Chinese work hours (in UTC +8, China's\ntime zone).\n\n- In contrast, the group's financially motivated activity targeting the video game\n\nindustry tends to occur much later in the night.\n\nOperational times at gaming targets are most frequent between 18:00 and 07:00 (UTC\n+8), providing some indication that the group is moonlighting. Note that this is based on\ndata collected over years and does not represent a daily schedule.\n\n- The typical working hours in China for tech workers is a \"996\" work schedule\n\n(9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., six days a week), which is consistent with APT41's operational\nactivity observed over time.\n\n- Operational times at targets not related to video games (and therefore, almost\n\ncertainly in support of state-sanctioned missions) are more frequent between 14:00\nand 22:00 (China Standard Time (CST), UTC +8), closer to conventional working hours\n(Figure 4).\n\n- Analysis of compile times for all portable executable (PE) files suggests that\n\nAPT41's average working hours fall between 10:00 to 23:00 (UTC +8), highlighting\nthat the financially motivated activity is most likely extraneous to their espionage\noperations.\n\n- Compile times for samples used in suspected financial gain missions are skewed\n\ntoward later in the evening, roughly 19:00 to 00:00 (UTC +8). However, there is\nsignificant overlap with the compile times of PE files deployed at espionage targets\nbetween 15:00 to 19:00 (UTC +8).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APT41 OPERATIONAL TIMES UTC +8\n\n**0** **1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8** **9** **10** **11** **12** **13** **14** **15** **16** **17** **18** **19** **20** **21** **22** **23**\n\nOperational Times at Gaming Targets\n\nOperational Times at Non-Gaming Targets\n\n**FIGURE 4.** Operational activity for gaming versus non-gaming-related targeting based on observed operations since 2012.\n\n\nThe group has also targeted cryptocurrencies, including\nat least one case in which there was a connection between\ncryptocurrency and an online video gaming platform.\n\n- In June 2018, APT41 sent spear-phishing emails using an\n\ninvitation lure to join a decentralized gaming platform linked to\na cryptocurrency service (Figure 5) that had positioned itself as\na medium of exchange for online games and gambling sites. The\nmalicious emails were sent from an email address listed with the\nname Tom Giardino, which is likely a reference to an employee\n\n\nat Valve, an American video game developer responsible for the\nsoftware distribution platform Steam and various video games.\nThe body of the email (Figure 6) also mentions gaming offerings.\nThis provides another connection between the targeting of the\ncryptocurrency organizations and video game targeting.\n\n- In October 2018, the group compiled an instance of XMRig, a\n\nMonero cryptocurrency mining tool, demonstrating a continued\ninterest in cryptocurrency.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 5.** Screenshot of invitation to join the FairWin online gaming platform.\n\nFrom: Tom Giardino < Date: <redacted>\nSubject: Project (FairWin) online application!\n\nProject Introduction:\nFairWin is a decentralized online gaming platform.\n\nBe sure to win fairness because our special FairChannel guarantees accurate RTP rates.\nThe system is based on a blockchain, which means that the gameplay process is open.

We believe these operations include broadly malicious activity that can enable further operations, such as targeting game source code and compromising digital certificates, while other activities are explicitly financially motivated, such as abusing in-game currency mechanics. APT41 campaigns focused on the video game sector have largely affected studios and distributors in East and Southeast Asia, although global companies based in the United States have also been targeted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group leverages many TTPs during the targeting of video game-related\norganizations, which are likewise employed in their espionage operations.\n\n- Since at least 2012, APT41 has repeatedly gained access to game development\n\nenvironments within affected companies, including online multiplayer networks, as\nwell as targeting of production database administrators.\n\n– The group is competent in both Linux and Windows environments and can\n\npivot easily between both environments within a single operation, including\ncompromising intermediary servers that provide access to separated Windows\nand Linux environments.\n\n– In October 2012, APT41 used captured credentials to compromise a jump server\n\nand access a production environment where they deployed a Linux version of\nPHOTO. Based on the machines targeted, we have some indication that APT41\nspecifically sought to access production machines used in the development of an\nupcoming online game.\n\n– In 2014, APT41 used a variant of SOGU that is capable of connecting to Windows\n\nand Linux systems via SSH and Samba/CIFS.\n\n– APT41 has been observed inserting malicious code into legitimate video game\n\nfiles to distribute malware. In 2018, the group inserted CRACKSHOT malware into\ngame files that were signed with legitimate code-signing certificates, most likely\nindicating access to the production environment, which facilitated a supply chain\ncompromise.\n\n    - A highly similar incident in 2014 suggests that APT41 (or a closely affiliated actor)\n\nhas a history of carrying out such operations against the video game industry.\n\nAPT41's experience gaining access to production environments may have been a\nprecursor to more recent supply chain compromises. The insertion of malware into a\nbuild environment for later distribution with legitimate software is a natural extension\nof the group's earliest activities. Additional details are provided in the section \"History\nof Supply Chain Compromises.\"\n\n- We have also observed APT41 limitedly deploy rootkits on Linux systems and Master\n\nBoot Record (MBR) bootkits, such as ROCKBOOT, on Windows systems to hide their\nmalware and maintain persistence on victim systems. Selective deployment of\nROCKBOOT suggests that APT41 reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for\nhigh-value targets.\n\n– Bootkits are a stealthy means of installing malware because the code resides\n\noutside of the OS. Because bootkits are initialized prior to the OS and operate\nin kernel mode, OS applications and security tools may have great difficulty\ndetecting bootkits.\n\n\n-----\n\n– The use of bootkits among threat actors, however, is rare. It\n\nis more common for threat actors to rely on techniques such\nas DLL search order hijacking or modifying Windows registry\nkeys to achieve persistence.\n\n– The group used the Adore-NG rootkit on older Linux operating\n\nsystems to hide their Linux backdoor ADORE.XSEC. Note that\nthe Adore-ng rootkit is no longer in development and would\nlikely not run successfully on modern Linux systems, but\nAPT41 deployed this on a legacy game server.\n\nAPT41 is well-known for leveraging compromised digital\ncertificates from video game studios to sign malware. The group\nhas abused at least 19 different certificates in this way. Additional\ndetails on code-signing certificates are provided in the section\n\"Use of Code Signing Certificates.\"\n\n - In 2012, APT41 used a code-signing certificate from Mgame, a\n\nSouth Korean game publisher, against other gaming industry\nentities. The serial number for this certificate was:\n```\n     01:00:00:00:00:01:30:73:85:f7:02\n\n```\n - A different Mgame digital certificate has been used by several\n\nother Chinese operators, including APT17, APT20, and APT31.\nIt is unclear if this certificate was compromised at the same\ntime as the one used by APT41 (or if it was stolen by APT41 and\nshared with these other groups). The serial number for this\ncertificate was:\n```\n 4e:eb:08:05:55:f1:ab:f7:09:bb:a9:ca:e3:2f:13:cd\n\n```\nAPT41 has blatantly engaged in financially motivated activity\ntargeting the video game industry, including manipulating\nvirtual currencies. These activities demonstrate established\nconnections to underground marketplaces and familiarity with\nmonetization and laundering techniques.\n\n\n\n- Using its access to a game production environment, in less than\n\nthree hours the group generated tens of millions of dollars of\na popular game's virtual currency. The money was credited to\nmore than 1,000 accounts and most likely sold and laundered in\nunderground markets.\n\n- APT41 has targeted payment services specializing in handling\n\nin-game transactions and real money transfer (RMT) purchases.\n\n- In a highly unusual case, APT41 attempted to extort a game\n\ncompany by deploying the Encryptor RaaS ransomware. We\nsuggest that APT41 sought to target in-game currency but\nfound they could not monetize the specific targeted game, so\nthe group resorted to ransomware to attempt to salvage their\nefforts and profit from the compromise.\n\n– This ransomware was sold via a Ransomware-as-a-Service\n\n(RaaS) operation that was available via a Tor (.onion) website.\nUsers of the ransomware were charged a 20 percent fee for\nany collected ransom.\n\n– Since this was not the group's typical method of choice\n\nfor collecting money from a victim environment, it is\npossible that APT41 turned to a pay-for-service ransomware\nto avoid having to develop such a tool or set up the associated\npayment and infrastructure associated with collecting the\nransom.\n\n– APT41 attempted to deploy the ransomware through a group\n\npolicy (GPO) scheduled task. However, the malware was\nunsuccessfully deployed because of a simple typo.\n\n– Figure 7 shows the ransom note associated with Encryptor\n\nRaaS, which contains default messages in both English and\nGerman (the instruction links have been redacted). Given\nthat this is the default message, the languages in the note\nshould not be considered when determining actor origin\nor location.\n\n```\nATTENTION!\n\n```\nThe files on your computer have been securely encrypted.\nTo get access to your files again, follow the instructions at:\n```\nACHTUNG!\n\n```\nDie Dateien auf Ihrem Computer wurden ischer verschluesselt.\nUm den Zugriff auf Ihre Dateien wiederzuerlangen, folgen Sie der Anleitung auf:\n\n**FIGURE 7.** Screenshot of ransomware note.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Third-Party Access\n\nIn multiple instances, APT41 targeted third parties and leveraged this access to target\nadditional victims. APT41's exploitation of third parties varied. In some instances, APT41\nmoved laterally from one victim environment to another in order to initiate compromise.\nAPT41 has also used credentials compromised in previous operations.\n\n- In 2014, APT41 compromised an online billing/payment service using VPN access\n\nbetween a third-party service provider and the targeted payment service. The\npayment service was likely targeted because it provided access to multiple gaming\ncompanies.\n\n- Although we do not have first-hand evidence of APT41's compromise of TeamViewer,\n\nwe have observed APT41 use compromised TeamViewer credentials as an entry\npoint at multiple organizations.\n\n– During a 2017 compromise, APT41 initiated a TeamViewer session and transferred\n\nfiles that were later deleted. Filenames and creation times indicate that these\nmay have been the HIGHNOON backdoor.\n\n– According to statements by a TeamViewer's spokesperson, the company was\n\ntargeted in fall 2016. The company stated that they conducted a comprehensive\nsecurity audit of its IT architecture and added additional security measures to\nhelp strengthen its security posture.\n\n\n-----\n\n## History of Supply Chain\n Compromises\n\nSupply chain compromises are most likely an extension of\nAPT41's tactics used in gaining access to gaming development\nenvironments and to other gaming organizations via third-party\nservice providers. Public reports of supply chain compromises\nlinked to APT41 date back to at least 2014, and technical evidence\nassociated with these incidents was used to determine a\nrelationship, if any, with APT41. Our assessment in each of these\ncases is noted in Table 1.\n\n- As demonstrated in operations targeting the video game\n\nindustry, APT41 leverages a variety of TTPs to access\nproduction environments where they can inject malicious code\ninto legitimate files. The files are signed with valid code-signing\ncertificates and distributed widely to end users.\n\n- Supply chain targeting requires more effort than typically\n\nobserved mass targeting methods, such as establishing a\nstrategic web compromise (SWC) or conducting large spearphishing campaigns.\n\n\nAlthough APT41 supply chain compromises affect very large\nnumbers of victims, the group limits follow-on activity to select\nvictims most likely to reduce detection and ensure any additional\nmalware is delivered only to intended victims. Counterintuitively,\nsupply chain operations add an additional layer of obscurity to the\ngroup's operations because it is difficult to pinpoint the desired\ntarget set.\n\n- In a June 2018 supply chain compromise, APT41 leveraged\n\nMAC addresses and C:\\ drive volume serial numbers to identify\nspecifically targeted victims for follow-on activity. This\nsignificantly obfuscates the targeted sector or victim set; in a\ntypical spear-phishing campaign, for example, desired targeting\ncan be discerned based on recipients' email addresses.\n\n\n**TABLE 1.** Supply chain compromises.\n\n\n**Date** **Compromised Entities** **FireEye Attribution Assessment**\n\n\n-----\n\n## December 2014\n\nIn December 2014, installers for three online games published\nby a Southeast Asian video game distributor were injected with\nthe SOGU backdoor. The installer for these popular games was\nreplaced by a malicious file that dropped the SOGU backdoor\nalong with the normal game installer.\n\n- The video game distributor operates servers in East and\n\nSoutheast Asia for some of the most popular online games,\nincluding the three games that were compromised: Path of\nExile, League of Legends, and FIFA Online 3 (Table 2).\n\nWe have observed many similarities between TTPs involved in this\ncompromise and APT41, including:\n\n- Targeting the same victim organization 31 days apart\n\n- Use of code-signing certificates from the same video game\nrelated issuer organizations\n\n\n\n- Use of the same malware families (HIGHNOON.BIN, HIGHNOON.\n\nLITE, EASYNIGHT, FRONTWHEEL)\n\n- Use of HIGHNOON.BIN samples with the same\n\ncompile times\n\n- Overlap in domain resolution to the same IP netblock\n\n(61.38.186.0/24) during the same time frame in 2012\n\n- Video game-related supply chain targeting\n\nDespite these compelling overlaps, the actors responsible for this\ncompromise leverage additional unique tools not observed with\nAPT41 or any other Chinese espionage group, suggesting that they\nare either part of APT41 and maintain their own toolset, or a close\naffiliate of APT41 that shares both tools and taskings.\n\n\n**TABLE 2.** 2014 compromised games.\n\n\n**Game** **File MD5** **Malware** **C&C**\n\n\n-----\n\n## March 2017\n\nIn March 2017, suspected Chinese espionage operators targeted\nCCleaner, a utility that assists in the removal of unwanted files\nfrom a computer. According to the parent company, Avast, the\ninfected CCleaner was downloaded by 2.27 million customers.\nWhile we have identified some overlaps between the CCleaner\nactivity and APT41, we do not have enough information to attribute\nthe CCleaner compromise to APT41 at this time.\n\n- Both APT41 and the actors in the CCleaner incident used\n\nTeamViewer during initial compromise. According to Avast,\nthe actors used TeamViewer to compromise a developer\nworkstation and used VBScript (x64.vbs) to drop a malicious\npayload.\n\n- The compromised CCleaner update (which we call\n\nDIRTCLEANER) is believed to download a second-stage loader\n(MD5: 748aa5fcfa2af451c76039faf6a8684d) that contains a 32bit and 64-bit COLDJAVA DLL payload. The COLDJAVA payload\ncontains shellcode that loads a variant of BLACKCOFFEE\n(Figure 8).\n\n– While COLDJAVA has been used by APT41, BLACKCOFFEE\n\nhas been used by other Chinese cyber espionage groups,\nincluding APT17 and APT40. It is possible that COLDJAVA may\nalso be shared between distinct cyber espionage operators.\n\n- Malware samples identified in the CCleaner incident included\n\nnotable shared design decisions observed in APT41 malware,\n\nDIRTCLEANER COLDJAVA BLACKCOFFEE\n\n**FIGURE 8.** Malware downloaded by DIRTCLEANER.\n\n\nincluding the use of domain generation algorithms (DGA) for\nC&C, use of dead drop resolvers (DDR), and use of shellcode as\nprimary payloads. However, FireEye malware analysis of the\ncompromised CCleaner samples and associated COLDJAVA\nsamples did not reveal shared code with the POISONPLUG and\nPOISONPLUG.SHADOW malware samples used in similar supply\nchain incidents by APT41.\n\n– DIRTCLEANER uses DGA to generate new C&C domains each\n\nmonth. This is similar to first-stage malware used in the\nNetsarang compromise described below.\n\n– The BLACKCOFFEE sample reaches out to actor-controlled\n\nprofiles hosted on legitimate websites to retrieve encoded\ncommands for C&C, a technique known as DDR. The malware\nparses the content of the websites (listed in Table 3), looking\nfor 12 bytes contained between the tags: \"BSM1cr0S0ft\" and\n\"SBM1cr0Soft.\" APT41 POISONPLUG samples have also used\nDDR for C&C.\n\n– The POISONPLUG and POISONPLUG.SHADOW samples in\n\nsimilar supply chain incidents use a shellcode format that\nresembles PE files, while the BLACKCOFFEE backdoor that\nwas delivered in the CCleaner compromise uses a traditional\nPIC blob. Additionally, there is apparent code reuse between\nobserved POISONPLUG and POISONPLUG samples not\nobserved in the CCleaner samples.\n\n\n**TABLE 3.** BLACKCOFFEE DDR websites.\n\n\n**File MD5** **Legitimate DDR Websites Used for C&C**\n\n\n3ca2a13f646690481\ndc15d78bac6d829\n\n\nhttps://github.com/search?q=joinlur\n&type=Users&utf8=%E2%9C%93\nhttps://en.search.wordpress.com/\n?src=organic&q=keepost\n\n\n-----\n\n## July 2017\n\nIn July 2017, APT41 injected malicious code into a software update\npackage maintained by Netsarang and signed it with a legitimate\nNetsarang certificate in an operation referred to as \"ShadowPad\"\nby Kaspersky. The software package is reportedly used by\nhundreds of companies worldwide.\n\n- We observed numerous opportunistic infections associated\n\nwith POISONPLUG.SHADOW spanning 13 countries and a variety\nof industries, demonstrating the broad impact of this operation.\nHowever, we have not observed the associated second-stage at\nany victim organizations. Open-source reporting indicated one\nvictim was identified in Hong Kong.\n\n- Signing the malicious update with a legitimate NetSarang\n\ncertificate is consistent with APT41's pattern of using legitimate\ncertificates. In this case, all updates were required to be signed\nby Netsarang, which means APT41 had to use the code-signing\ncertificate to subvert the update mechanism.\n\n\n– Alternatively, it is also possible that APT41 injected malicious\n\ncode into the package prior to compilation, circumventing the\nneed to steal the code-signing certificate and compile it on\ntheir own.\n\n- The first stage of the malware uses DGA, which changes its C&C\n\nservers monthly. The use of shifting network infrastructure\nis most likely intended to add operational robustness and to\nreduce detection.\n\nThe second-stage shellcode is initialized only after it is activated\nusing a decryption key retrieved from the first-stage DNS\ncommunications. This likely allows APT41 to selectively activate\nthe payload on specific victim systems. The second-stage\npayload contains the default C&C server, notped.com, which\noverlaps with other APT41 C&C infrastructure. Other reported\nAPT41 domains that may also be related to the second-stage\npayload can be found in Table 4.\n\n\n**TABLE 4.** Reported APT41 domains associated with POISONPLUG.SHADOW.\n\n\n**Domain** **Associated Malware Family**\n\n\nnotped.com POISONPLUG.SHADOW\n\ndnsgogle.com SOGU\n\noperatingbox.com POISONPLUG\n\npaniesx.com Unknown\n\ntechniciantext.com Unknown\n\n\n-----\n\n## June 2018\n\nIn June 2018, a utility used to update ASUS computers was\ncompromised in an operation dubbed \"ShadowHammer\" by\nKaspersky. Open-source reporting **indicated that more than**\n50,000 systems installed the malicious update, yet the malware\nwas only designed to execute and retrieve second-stage malware\non a designated list of approximately 600 systems, demonstrating\nthis was a targeted campaign. Public reporting on the incident\nnoted that many of the targeted MAC addresses were associated\nwith wireless adapters from various vendors, partially indicating\nthe operation's targeting strategy.\n\n- Although we have limited visibility into the intended targets\n\nof this operation, we observed one of the whitelisted MAC\naddresses on a system at a telecom company.\n\n- Kaspersky's analysis of the infected machines revealed that a\n\nPOISONPLUG backdoor was installed as a result of the malicious\nupdate. While we have been unable to attribute the DAYJOB\nmalware used in the incident to APT41 due to an inability to\nindependently confirm this sequence of events, we confirm\nthe reported stage-two POISONPLUG backdoor is attributed\n\n\nto APT41, contained several gaming references, and was likely\nused to target the gaming industry.\n\n- The POISONPLUG sample (MD5: 37e100dd8b2ad8b301b130c2bca\n\n3f1ea) attempts to connect to a Google document that was\ncreated under the same name and email address (Tom Giardino\nand ) that was used to target the\ncryptocurrency organization. It also attempts to connect to a\nSteam community page (Table 5).\n\n- The POISONPLUG payload uses DDR and parses the Google\n\ndocument for a C&C command. The Steam community page is\nlikely used as a fallback mechanism.\n\n- FireEye malware analysis of the POISONPLUG sample indicates\n\nthe malware is likely designed to run only one system with a C:\ndrive volume serial number of 0xc25cff4c.\n\n- Additional POISONPLUG samples located in Table 6 also\n\nleverage Google Document and Steam Community Pages for\nC&C.\n\n\n**TABLE 5.** \"ShadowHammer\" stage-two POISONPLUG sample.\n\n\n**File MD5** **C&C Domain**\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQwnF3ibWPZ6-95VHrRAPrL6u_UT_K7X-rQrB7xt95k\n37e100dd8b2ad8b301b130c2bca3f1ea\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/oswal053\n\n\n**TABLE 6.** POISONPLUG samples leveraging dead drop resolving.\n\n\n**File MD5** **C&C Domain**\n\n\n557ff68798c71652db8a85596a4bab72 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KJ_RJRtkKhcuJjXOCKtEOLuwH3sRi72PUhtfukncyRc\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkTC3fHUvEBsBurZIGw7Kf5YsPjblpahl1FksRDCuTo\nff8d92dfbcda572ef97c142017eec658\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/119887132\n\nb0877494d36fab1f9f4219c3defbfb19 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQwnF3ibWPZ6-95VHrRAPrL6u_UT_K7X-rQrB7xt95k\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1lCySd5ZNGj9Jz8pigZsuv8lciusYKqOq0Rpe2E0zgmU\nffd0f34739c1568797891b9961111464\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/869406565\n\n\n-----\n\n## July 2018\n\nBeginning in July 2018, APT41 appeared to have directly targeted\nseveral East and Southeast Asia-based video game developers\nand distributors to inject legitimate executables with the\nCRACKSHOT backdoor.\n\n- Like other high-profile supply chain compromises attributed\n\nto APT41, these incidents included the incorporation of\nmalicious code into legitimate executables and the signing of\nthese files using legitimate digital certificates from the same\ncompromised organization.\n\n\n\n- APT41 used a C&C domain that masquerades as Xigncode,\n\n, in the compromise of\nthe video game PointBlank. Ironically, Xigncode is a service\nintended to prevent hacking and cheating in online games.\n\n- We attribute these compromises (also reported by both\n\n**ESET and Kaspersky) to APT41 based on the unique use of**\nthe CRACKSHOT backdoor and tactics consistent with APT41\noperations. A list of related indicators is in Table 7.\n\n\n**TABLE 7.** Video games industry targeting in July 2018.\n\n\n**Targeted Game / Platform** **MD5 Hashes** **Malware** **C&C Domain**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Overlaps Between Espionage\n and Financial Operations\n\n\nIdentified overlaps across various incidents attributed to APT41\ndemonstrate the group's dual nature. Figure 9 and Figure 10\nillustrate crossover between espionage and financially motivated\nactivity, as well as technical similarities in tools used across both\ntypes of operations.\n\n- The email address was used to send\nspear-phishing emails to a Taiwanese newspaper with the\nsubject lure \"I have a little surprise for you :)\" in an espionage\ncampaign in August 2016 (Figure 9).\n\n- The same email address was later used to target a\n\ncryptocurrency exchange in June 2018, demonstrating\nemail reuse between espionage operations and financially\nmotivated activity.\n\n\n– The lure used to target the cryptocurrency exchange\n\n(displayed in Figure 5 and translated in Figure 6) referenced an\nonline gaming platform, tying the cryptocurrency targeting to\nAPT41's focus on video game-related targeting.\n\n– As depicted in Figure 10, hrsimon59@gmail.com was used to\n\ncreate a Google document being used as a POISONPLUG (MD5:\n37e100dd8b2ad8b301b130c2bca3f1ea) C&C.

The stage-one loader\nfor this sample (MD5: 830a09ff05eac9a5f42897ba5176a36a)\nshares code overlaps with the stage-one shellcode loader\n(MD5: a6c7db170bc7a4ee2cdb192247b59cd6) used in the\nNetsarang compromise, first reported by Kaspersky as\nShadowPad. These connections, illustrated in Figure 10,\nled us to identify the malware used in the Netsarang\nincident as a variant of POISONPLUG (therefore:\nPOISONPLUG.SHADOW).\n\n– The POISONPLUG and POISONPLUG.SHADOW variants share\n\nthe observed commonalities:\n\n    - The entrypoint functions for both loaders use the same\n\ninstructions, constants, and structures to pass control to\nloading routines.\n\n    - The layout of functions and data within the loaders are\n\nthe same; for example, following the entrypoint, both\nloaders contain an unusual region of structured data\n0x60 bytes long.\n\n\n\n    - Both loaders use the same API hashing algorithm to resolve\n\nroutines from system libraries (Figure 11 and Figure 12).\nThe routine uses byte-wise operations to compute a hash,\nincluding byte-wise rotate-right by eight bits, byte-wise\nbinary, OR with 0x20, and byte-wise XOR using the four-byte\nkey 0x7C35D9A3. Using this routine, the hash for kernel32.\ndll, a common DLL provided by Microsoft Windows, is\n0xFD5B1261.\n\n- FireEye analysis of a separate POISONPLUG payload (MD5:\n\nc8403fabda4d036a55d0353520e765c9) compiled in July 2017\nand the POISONPLUG.SHADOW stage-two shellcode loader\n(MD5: 72584d6b7dd10c82d9118567b548b2b1) identified multiple\nadditional plug-in similarities.\n\n– Core plug-in IDs between the samples are the same, including\n\n100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and 201.\n\n– Core plug-in names are the same including Plugins, Online,\n\nConfig, Install, and HTTP.\n\n– C&C plug-in IDs and names between both samples are the\n\nsame, including 200/TCP, 201/HTTP, 202/UDP, 203/DNS, 204/\nHTTPS, and 205/SSL.\n\n– Both samples parse the C&C response by searching for \"$\"\n\ncharacters and decoding the result.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT41 is attributable to\nChinese individuals who are working on behalf of the Chinese\nstate in conducting cyber espionage operations, and that these\nactors are also running financially motivated campaigns for\npersonal gain.\n\nTwo identified personas using the monikers \"Zhang Xuguang\"\nand \"Wolfzhi\" linked to APT41's operations have also been\nidentified in Chinese-language forums. Attribution to these\nindividuals is backed by identified persona information, the\nprevious work of these individuals, their apparent expertise\nin programming skills, and their targeting of Chinese marketspecific games. It is uncertain how many other individuals may\nalso be associated with APT41.\n\n- Multiple domains leveraged by early APT41 activity were\n\nregistered by emails and names associated with both Zhang\nXuguang and Wolfzhi (or their alternative monikers). Registrant\ninformation also included references to Beijing and Chinese\nphone numbers (+86 country code).\n\nZhang Xuguang (张旭光) registered more than a dozen domains\nmasquerading as video games or companies with trusted\nrelationships with video game developers/distributors. Longrunning activity provides a catalog of Zhang's efforts to improve\nhis skills and expertise over time.\n\n- Additional names include: kbkxlp, akbkxlp, injuriesa,\n\nravinder10, Addison Lau, and addison jack\n\n- Associated email addresses:\n\n– akbklxp@126.com\n\n– akbklxp@163.com\n\n– hackershby@126.com\n\n– injuriesa@126.com\n\n– injuriesa@163.com\n\n– injuriesa@gmail.com\n\n– injuriesa@hotmail.com\n\n– injuriesa@qq.com\n\n– kbklxp@126.com\n\n– ravinder10@126.com\n\n– ravinder10@hotmail.com\n\n– ravinder10@sohu.com\n\n\n\n- Examples of domains registered to known aliases (some of\n\nthese may have since been re-registered legitimately):\n\n– \"Addison Lau\"\n\n    - agegamepay.com\n\n    - ageofwuxia.com\n\n    - ageofwuxia.info\n\n    - ageofwuxia.net\n\n    - ageofwuxia.org\n\n    - gamewushu.com\n\n    - microsOff.com\n\n    - microsOtf.com\n\n    - serverbye.com\n\n– \"addisonjack\"\n\n    - byeserver.com\n\nIn 2005, Zhang posted personal information on “华夏黑客同\n盟” (Chinese Hackers Alliance), a popular Chinese online forum,\nthat listed his date of birth as 1989, that he previously lived in\nInner Mongolia, and that he specialized in script hacking (Figure\n13). Zhang's profile indicated he was 16, going on 17, and he was\napplying to be the administrator of a script hacking forum.\n\n- Spoofed domains most likely targeted players of games such as\n\n\"Age of Wuxia,\" a massively multiplayer online role-playing game\n(MMORPG) themed on cultural references to dynastic China.\nZhang Xugang's interest in these games is also apparent in his\nregistration and posting on a forum dedicated to the Age of\nWuxia (Figure 14).\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 13.** Screenshot of Zhang's profile, with \"Zhang Xuguang\" highlighted in orange.\n\n**FIGURE 14.** Zhang posting to Age of Wuxia forum, with his alias \"injuriesa\" highlighted in yellow.\n\n\n-----\n\nWolfzhi is linked to a 2017 profile on a data science\ncommunity page, which indicated that he had 10 years\nworking experience at the time of the posting, with significant\nexperience in Oracle and Python.

APT41 also leverages PHOTO\n(aka \"Derusbi\") and SOGU (aka \"Destroy RAT\" and \"PlugX\"), tools\nshared much more widely among Chinese espionage groups.\nSee the section \"Links to Other Known Chinese Operators\" for\nmore details.\n\n- An APT41 HIGHNOON sample (MD5: 36711896cfeb67f599305b590\n\nf195aec) from 2012 contained a process debugging path (.pdb)\nwith the Chinese-language directory \"D:\\桌面\\木马,\" which\ntranslates to \"D:\\Desktop\\trojan.\"\n\n- Compiled HTML (.chm) files used in targeting contained\n\na language code set to \"Chinese (Simplified)\" despite the lure\ncontent being in the target region's language (English\nor otherwise).\n\n- Compile and operational times of APT41 activity suggest the\n\nbulk of the group's work hours, 10:00 and 23:00 (UTC +8), are\nconsistent with the Chinese workday, especially for tech sector\nemployees on a \"996 schedule.\"\n\n– Figure 4 shows a breakdown of all of the operational activity\n\nwithin victim environments, separated between gaming\nand espionage (non-gaming) activity. Analysis of the times\nwhere APT41 modified or accessed a file within a victim\nenvironment, shows a concentration between 10:00 and\n18:00 (UTC+8).\n\n- Targeting of healthcare, semiconductors, and telecoms is\n\nconsistent with Chinese state interests and parallels activity\nfrom other Chinese espionage groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Status as Potential Contractors\n\n\nWe assess with moderate confidence that APT41 is constituted\nof contractors tasked by the Chinese state to conduct espionage\noperations. Individuals attributed to the group have previously\nindicated that they could be hired and advertised their skills and\nservices. APT41's use of the same malware in both financial- and\nespionage-related operations could support their status as\ncontractors; state employees are less likely to use such tools for\npersonal financial gain over multiple years given the potential for\ngreater scrutiny or punishment.\n\n- APT41 cyber crime activity includes the use of espionage-only\n\nmalware, indicating two possible conclusions: either APT41 is\noperating outside of state control but still working with other\nChinese APT malware actors, tools, and infrastructure on a\npart-time or contractual basis, or APT41 is a full-time, statesponsored APT actor but is also working outside of state control\nor direction for supplemental income.\n\n– Tools used by APT41 in financially motivated operations\n\ninclude the use of HOMEUNIX and PHOTO, which are nonpublic malware used only by other Chinese espionage actors.\n\n– A loose time separation between espionage and cyber crime\n\nactivities provides some indication that the group divides its\nwork hours between both types of operations. For additional\ndetails, see Figure 4 and the previous section \"Financially\nMotivated Activity.\"\n\n**•** **Public reports on Chinese hackers highlight that skilled actors**\n\nopt to work for private sector entities that have government\ncontracts because of better pay.\n\n**FIGURE 16.** Ocean injection tool posted by Zhang.\n\n\n\n- Underground activity dating back to 2009 indicated that\n\nZhang Xuguang is a hacker for hire. Zhang advertised on\nforums that he was available for professional penetration\nand hacking services.\n\n– Zhang listed his online hours from 4:00 p.m. – 6:00 a.m.,\n\nwhich are similar to the operational times observed at gaming\ntargets displayed in Figure 4.\n\n- He was also observed sharing an injection tool named Ocean\n\nhysi (海洋hysi注入工具) to demonstrate his skills, as displayed\nin Figure 16.\n\nChina has previously relied on contractors to bolster state\nresources dedicated to cyber espionage activity. Increased\nintegration between government units and civilian entities,\nincluding contractors and freelancers, is believed to be a key\n**feature of Chinese cyber policy.**\n\n- According to indictments unsealed by the U.S. Department\n\nof Justice (USDOJ) in December 2018, APT10 was operated\nby contractors working for the China's Ministry of State\nSecurity (MSS).\n\n- In a USDOJ indictment unsealed in November 2017, individual\n\ncontractors responsible for APT3 were found to be working for\nan MSS front company.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Links to Other Known Chinese Espionage Operators\n\nAPT41 uses many of the same tools and compromised digital certificates that have been\nleveraged by other Chinese espionage operators. Initial reports about HIGHNOON and\nits variants (reported publicly as \"Winnti\") dating back to at least 2013 indicated the tool\nwas exclusive to a single group, contributing to significant conflation across multiple\ndistinct espionage operations.\n\n- APT41 overlaps at least partially with public reporting on groups including BARIUM\n\n(Microsoft) and Winnti (Kaspersky, ESET, Clearsky). In some cases, the primary\nobserved similarity in the publicly reported Winnti activity was the use of the same\nmalware—including HIGHNOON—across otherwise separate clusters of activity.\n\n- Previous FireEye Threat Intelligence reporting on the use of HIGHNOON and\n\nrelated activity was grouped together under both GREF and Mana, although we now\nunderstand this to be the work of several Chinese cyber espionage groups that share\ntools and digital certificates.\n\n- APT41 reflects our current understanding of what was previously reported as GREF,\n\nas well as additional indicators and activity gathered during our extensive review of\nour intelligence holdings.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Certificate Overlap\n\nA digital certificate issued by YNK Japan\nthat was publicly reported as being used\nby Winnti has been used by multiple\nChinese espionage operators, including\nAPT17, and APT20, and APT41.\n\nA self-signed digital certificate\npurporting to be from the Microsoft\nCertificate Authority has been used by\nboth APT41 and APT40 to sign samples\nof the PHOTO backdoor.\n\nThe overlaps in groups observed\nusing these certificates is illustrated\nin Table 8.\n\n\nIssuer: CN=VeriSign Class 3 Code Signing 2009-2 CA\nSubject: CN=YNK JAPAN Inc\nSerial Number: 67:24:34:0d:db:c7:25:2f:7f:b7:14:b8:12:a5:c0:4d\nIssue-Date: 11/27/09, Expiration-Date: 11/27/11\n\nIssuer: CN=Microsoft Certificate Authority\nSubject: CN=Microsoft Certificate Authority\nSerial Number: (Negative)77:62:e5:c6:c9:c2:75:59:b0:b8:f5:56:60:61:d8:78\n\nIssue-Date: 12/31/2009, Expiration-Date: 12/30/2035\n\n\n**TABLE 8.** Example of shared certificates between APT groups.\n\n\n**Serial Number** **Subject** **APT17** **APT20** **APT40** **APT41**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Launcher Overlap\n\nThe use of DLL side-loading has been a source of continued\nconfusion when used as an indicator for distinct operations. This\n**technique uses a legitimate and often digitally signed executable to**\nessentially trick a system into launching a malicious DLL because it\nhas been given the same name as a legitimate DLL normally loaded\nby the executable. The use of a valid and digitally signed executable\n\n\nallows actors to bypass host-based security measures. For this\nreason, it continues to be popular mechanism used by multiple\ngroups. This also explains why the use of these DLL filenames is\nnot a unique indicator for distinct APT operators. Table 9 contains\nlegitimate executables used by APT41 and selected other Chinese\ncyber espionage groups for DLL side-loading:\n\n\n**TABLE 9.

Source code\noverlaps between observed code families indicate potential\naccess to shared code repositories or common developers\nbetween groups.\n\n- APT41 has used several malware families that have also been\n\nused by other Chinese espionage operators, including variants\nof HIGHNOON, HOMEUNIX, PHOTO, SOGU, and ZXSHELL, among\nothers. Table 10 illustrates some of overlap between malware\nfamilies used by APT41 and other APT groups. Note that this is\nonly for illustration purposes and is not indicative of all observed\nmalware families used by these APT groups or all groups that\nhave used those families.\n\n\n– HIGHNOON, one of the main code families observed being\n\nused by APT41, was also used by APT17 in 2015 to target\nsemiconductor and chemical manufacturers.\n\n– HOMEUNIX, another popular backdoor used by APT41, has\n\nbeen used by at least 14 separate Chinese espionage groups,\nincluding APT1, APT10, APT17, APT18, and APT20.\n\n– JUMPALL is a dropper that has been observed dropping\n\nvariants of the HIGHNOON, ZXSHELL, and SOGU code\nfamilies attributed to APT17 and APT41.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TABLE 10.

Another Chinese\nespionage group used a similar tool, CLASSFON, to covertly\nproxy network communications in 2011.\n\n    - CLASSFON (MD5: 9e1a54d3dc889a7f0e56753c0486fd0f)\n\nhas an internal name of DrvDll.dll and an embedded device\ndriver that is internally named PlusDll.dll (Table 11). The\nPlusDll.dll filename has also been identified in APT41\nHIGHNOON.BIN samples (Table 12).\n\n\n– PDB paths identified in related APT41 HIGHNOON.BIN samples\n\ncontain the name \"RBDoor,\" which has also been identified\nin samples of HIGHNOON, HIGHNOON.LITE, HIGHNOON.CLI,\nand GEARSHIFT (Figure 17). APT41 files containing PDB paths\nreferencing \"RBDoor\" are listed in Table 13. At least two of\nthese malware families, HIGHNOON.CLI and GEARSHIFT,\nhave been used by APT17 and another suspected Chinese\nespionage group.\n\n- Further information regarding code family overlaps between\n\nvariants can be found in \"Technical Annex: Additional Malware\nOverlaps.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nH:\\Double-V1\\stone_srv\\Bin\\RbDoor64.pdb\nH:\\Double\\Door_wh\\AppInit\\x64\\Release\\AppInit.pdb\nH:\\Double\\Door_wh\\RbDoorX64\\x64\\Release\\RbDoorX64.pdb\nH:\\Double\\door_wh_kav\\Bin\\RbDoor64.pdb\nH:\\RBDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\AppInit\\Release\\AppInit.pdb\nH:\\RBDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\AppInit\\x64\\Release\\AppInit.pdb\nH:\\RBDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\ShutDownEvent\\x64\\Release\\ShutDownEvent.pdb\nH:\\RbDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\AppInit\\Release\\AppInit.pdb\nH:\\RbDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\RbDoorX64\\Release\\RbDoor.pdb\nH:\\RbDoor\\Anti_winmm\\AppInit\\ShutDownEvent\\Release\\ShutDownEvent.pdb\nH:\\RbDoor\\Lib\\WMI_SSL\\RemoteLib\\bin\\TestRjLib.pdb\nH:\\Svn\\Double-V1\\stone_srv\\Bin\\RbDoor64.pdb\n\n**FIGURE 17.** PDB paths containing \"RBDoor\".\n\n\n**TABLE 13.

Notably, most of the digital certificates being used\nin this manner are valid unrevoked digital certificates stolen from\nEast Asia-based game development studios. APT41 likely signs\ntheir malware to ensure compatibility with the targeted systems\nand to potentially avoid detection.\n\n- Microsoft requires all kernel-mode drivers to be signed in order\n\nto run on operating systems running Windows Vista or later.\n\n- The use of code-signing certificates can also significantly\n\ndecrease the likelihood that a malicious payload is detected.\n\nAlthough we do not have direct evidence of APT41 specifically\ntargeting and stealing code-signing certificates, we have some\nindication from targeting of affected organizations within the\nsame time frame that digital certificates are first compromised\nand used to sign malware.\n\n- Stealing private keys or compromising an organization's\n\ninfrastructure to access and steal digital certificates abuses\ntrust relationships between firms and certificate authorities.\nMalicious files signed with valid digital certificates can\ncircumvent automated scanning/ blocking solutions and\nbypass Windows group policies which restrict unsigned code\nfrom running.\n\n– Even when detected, malicious files signed by a digital\n\ncertificate from a trusted partner or associated business are\nless likely to draw suspicion. According to an advertisement\nin an underground marketplace, the success rate of installing\na payload increases by as much as 50 percent when signing\nfiles with valid digital certificates.\n\n\n– In most cases, multiple digital certificates are issued to an\n\norganization using the same public name, making it more\ndifficult to identify a compromised certificate among others\nwith identical names.\n\n– Certificate authorities are responsible for revoking\n\ncompromised digital certificates, although response times\ncan vary greatly, and digital certificates can continue to be\nabused even long after they are first identified being misused.\n\n- Several malware samples were signed very close to the\n\ncertificate issue date, suggesting that APT41 or a related actor\nhad access to the private key or build environment at that time.\nIt is also possible the group acquired the private keys soon after\nthey were issued.\n\n- In some cases, digital certificates were used to sign malware\n\nsamples just before they expired, most likely indicating the\nactors were actively managing a library of digital certificates for\nthis purpose.\n\n- Figure 18 depicts compile times of malware signed with\n\ncompromised digital certificates within the time frame that\nthe certificates were valid. All of the certificates listed in the\ngraphic have either been revoked or are currently expired.\nIndicators associated with these certificates are listed in\n\"Technical Annex: Code Signing Certificates Used by APT41.\"\n\n- Alternatively, it is possible APT41 may have purchased the digital\n\ncertificates used for signing malware within an underground\nmarket. FireEye researchers found that code signing\ncertificates are currently available for sale in underground\nmarketplaces for as little as $399 USD, although ones that go\nthrough rigorous vetting can be sold for $1,699 USD.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### OBSERVED USE OF CODE SIGNING CERTIFICATES\n\nElectronics Extreme Limited\n\nZepetto Co.\n\nEn Masse Entertainment\n\nGameUS Inc.\n\nShanda Games\n\nNetSarang Computer\n\nWemade Entertainment Co.\n\nXL Games Co.\n\nNanjing Ranyi Technology Co.\n\nGuangzhou YuanLuo Technology Co.\n\nFuqing Dawu Technolofy Co.\n\nMgame Corp\n\nxlgames\n\nNeowix Corporation\n\nWebzen Inc.\n\nGuangzhou YuanLuo Technology Co.\n\nYNK JAPAN Inc.\n\n**11/27/09** **4/11/11** **8/23/12** **1/5/14** **5/20/15** **10/1/16** **2/13/18** **6/28/19**\n\nCertificate Validity Dates\n\nFirst Observed Malware Sample Signed with Compromised Certificate\n\n**FIGURE 18.** First observed malware samples signed with digital certificates (white) in relation to valid certificate dates (blue).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\n###### APT41 is a dual threat demonstrating creativity and aggressiveness in carrying out both espionage campaigns and financially motivated operations. The group's capabilities and targeting have both widened over time, signaling the potential for additional supply chain compromises affecting more victims in additional verticals.\n\n APT41's links to both underground marketplaces and state-sponsored\n activity may indicate the group enjoys protections that enables it to conduct\n its own for-profit activities, or authorities are willing to overlook them.\n It is also possible that APT41 has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities. Regardless, these operations underscore a blurred line between state power and crime that lies at the heart of threat ecosystems and is exemplified by APT41.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TECHNICAL ANNEX\n\n## Attack Lifecycle\n\n\n\n- Encryptor RaaS\n\n- XMRIG\n\n- Clear “.bash_history”\nfiles\n\n- Clear Windows\nsecurity and system\nevent logs\n\n- Compress data\nusing RAR\n\n- Credential theft\n\n- Delete Scheduled\ntasks\n\n- Intellectual property\ntheft\n\n- Modify DNS\nmanagement to avoid\nanti-virus detection\n\n- Steal in-game\ncurrencies\n\n\n\n- HIGHNOON\n\n- SOGU\n\n- Brute-force local\nadmin account\n\n- Creation of user accounts\nadded to User and\nAdmin groups\n\n- Modification of the\nlegitimate WMI\nPerformance Adapter\n\n- RDP\n\n- Scheduled tasks\n\n- Stolen credentials\n\n\n**INITIAL COMPROMISE**\n\n\n**ESTABLISH FOOTHOLD**\n\n\n\n- ADORE.XSEC\n\n- CROSSWALK\n\n- CROSSWALK.BIN\n\n- FRONTWHEEL\n\n- HIGHNOON\n\n- HIGHNOON.BIN\n\n- HIGHNOON.LINUX\n\n- HOMEUNIX\n\n- PACMAN\n\n- PHOTO\n\n- POISONPLUG\n\n- POWERSPLOIT\n\n- ROCKBOOT\n\n- SOGU\n\n- Scheduled tasks\n\n- Startup files\n\n- Sticky Keys Vulnerability\n\n- Windows Registry\nmodifications\n\n**MAINTAIN PRESENCE**\n\n**ESCALATE PRIVILEGE**\n\n- ACEHASH\n\n- GEARSHIFT\n\n- Mimikatz\n\n- NTDSDump\n\n- PHOTO\n\n- PwDump\n\n- WINTERLOVE\n\n- Bypass User Account\nControl\n\n- Password hash\ndumping\n\n- Windows Credential\nEditor (WCE)\n\n\n**COMPLETE MISSION**\n\n\n\n - CHINACHOP\n\n - Credential theft\n\n - CVE-2019-3369\n\n - Spear-phishing\n\n - Stolen credentials\n\n - TeamViewer\n\n**FIGURE 19.** APT41 attack lifecycle.\n\n\n\n- ACEHASH\n\n- ASPXSpy\n\n- Beacon\n\n- CHINACHOP\n\n- COLDJAVA\n\n- CRACKSHOT\n\n- CROSSWALK\n\n- DEADEYE\n\n- DOWNTIME\n\n- EASYNIGHT\n\n- Gh0st\n\n- HIGHNOON\n\n- HIGHNOON.LITE\n\n- HIGHNOON.PASTEBOY\n\n- HKDOOR\n\n- HOTCHAI\n\n- JUMPALL\n\n- LATELUNCH\n\n- LIFEBOAT\n\n- LOWKEY\n\n- njRAT\n\n- PHOTO\n\n- POISONPLUG\n\n- POISONPLUG.SHADOW\n\n- POTROAST\n\n- SAGEHIRE\n\n- SOGU\n\n- SWEETCANDLE\n\n- TERA\n\n- TIDYELF\n\n- WINTERLOVE\n\n- XDOOR\n\n- ZXSHELL\n\n- PowerShell\n\n- Sticky Keys Vulnerability\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Initial Compromise\n\n\nAPT41 leverages a variety of techniques to perform an initial compromise, including spear-phishing,\nmoving laterally from trusted third parties, leveraging stolen credentials, using the CHINACHOP web shell,\nand accessing victim organizations using remote desktop sharing software, such as TeamViewer. APT41\noften relies on the use of simple spear-phishing email with attachments such as compiled HTML (.chm)\nfiles to initially compromise their victims. However, once in a victim organization, the operation can\nleverage more sophisticated TTPs and deploy additional malware tools.\n\n\n\n- In a campaign running almost one year, APT41 compromised hundreds of systems and used close to\n\n150 unique pieces of malware including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits.\n\n- We have observed TeamViewer credentials used as an entry point in multiple intrusions across\n\nindustries. In these instances, APT41 leveraged TeamViewer to transfer malware into the\ncompromised environment, although we do not have direct evidence of APT41 compromising\nTeamViewer.\n\n– In July 2017, APT41 initiated a TeamViewer session and transferred files that were later deleted.\n\nFilenames and creation times indicate that these may have been the HIGHNOON backdoor.\n\n– In May 2018, APT41 used TeamViewer for initial entry in the compromise of a healthcare company.\n\nDuring this intrusion, APT41 started a TeamViewer session and shortly after transferred DLL\nfiles associated with the CROSSWALK backdoor to the victim environment before deploying\nCROSSWALK.\n\nThe group has leveraged several exploits in their operations. Notably, APT41 was observed using proofof-concept exploit code for CVE-2019-3396 within 23 days after the Confluence vulnerability was\nannounced.\n\n###### Observed Vulnerabilities\n\n- CVE-2012-0158\n\n- CVE-2015-1641\n\n- CVE-2017-0199\n\n- CVE-2017-11882\n\n- CVE-2019-3396\n\nAPT41 compromised one organization and moved to a client environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Establish Foothold\n\n\nAPT41 uses a variety of malware and tools, both public and unique to the group, to establish a foothold\nwith a victim's environment, including:\n\n\n\n- ASPXSpy\n\n- ACEHASH\n\n- Beacon\n\n- CHINACHOP\n\n- COLDJAVA\n\n- CRACKSHOT\n\n- CROSSWALK\n\n- DEADEYE\n\n- DOWNTIME\n\n- EASYNIGHT\n\n- Gh0st\n\n\n\n- HIGHNOON.LITE\n\n- HIGHNOON.PASTEBOY\n\n- HOTCHAI\n\n- HKDOOR\n\n- JUMPALL\n\n- LATELUNCH\n\n- LIFEBOAT\n\n- LOWKEY\n\n- njRAT\n\n- POISONPLUG\n\n\n\n- POISONPLUG.SHADOW\n\n- POTROAST\n\n- SAGEHIRE\n\n- SOGU\n\n- SWEETCANDLE\n\n- TERA\n\n- TIDYELF\n\n- XDOOR\n\n- WINTERLOVE\n\n- ZXSHELL\n\n\nAPT41 has been observed using Linux and Windows variants of the same malware families, such as\nPHOTO and HIGHNOON. The group often initially installs its backdoors to c:\\windows\\temp.\n\nWe have observed APT41 attempting to masquerade their files and domains as popular anti-virus\nsoftware:\n\n- kasparsky.net\n\n- macfee.ga\n\n- symanteclabs.com\n\nAPT41 appears to use the commercially available Beacon backdoor that is part of the Cobalt Strike\npen-testing software platform. In at least one instance, a server used for Beacon C&C was also\nleveraged for CROSSWALK C&C.\n\nOn multiple occasions, APT41 leveraged the Sticky Keys vulnerability and PowerShell to deploy\nmalware families in victims' environments.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Escalate Privileges\n\n\nAPT41 escalates its privileges in systems by leveraging custom-made and publicly available tools to gather\ncredentials and dump password hashes. The tools include:\n\n\n\n- ACEHASH\n\n- GEARSHIFT\n\n- GOODLUCK\n\n- Mimikatz\n\n\n\n- NTDSDump\n\n- PHOTO\n\n- PwDump\n\n- WINTERLOVE\n\n\n###### Windows Credential Editor (WCE)\nAPT41 frequently uses the Windows Credential Editor to dump password hashes from memory and\nauthenticate other user accounts.\n\n\n#### Internal Reconnaissance\n\n\nAPT41 conducts network reconnaissance after using compromised credentials to log on to other systems.\nThe group leverages built-in Windows commands, such as \"netstat\" and \"net share,\" in addition to the\ncustom and non-public malware families SOGU, HIGHNOON, and WIDETONE.\n\n\n\n- HIGHNOON includes the ability to collect host information by enumerating active Remote Desktop\n\nProtocol (RDP) sessions.\n\n- SOGU is capable of listing TCP and UDP network connections, respectively.\n\n- WIDETONE is capable of conducting port scans and password brute-force attacks and collecting\n\nnetwork information. It contains an embedded variant of a publicly available enumeration tool and\ncan be run with the following options:\n\n– \"-hbs\" option runs a port scan on the specified subnet.\n\n– \"-hscan\" scans the specified IP range for IPC and SQL services.\n\n– \"-enum\" queries a Windows host for requested information, such as users, groups/members,\n\npolicies, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Lateral\n Movement\n\n\nAPT41 assesses the network architecture of an organization and identifies pivotal systems for enabling\nfurther access. The group has repeatedly identified intermediary systems that provide access to\notherwise segmented parts of an organization's network (as outlined in Case Study: Video Game\nIndustry Targeting). Once APT41 has identified intermediary systems, it moves quickly to compromise\nsystems. In one case, hundreds of systems across several geographic regions were compromised in as\nlittle as two weeks.\n\nAPT41 uses multiple methods to perform lateral movement in an environment, including RDP sessions,\nusing stolen credentials, adding accounts to User and Admin groups, and password brute-forcing\nutilities. The group will also use a compromised account to create scheduled tasks on systems or\nmodify legitimate Windows services to install the HIGHNOON and SOGU backdoors.\n\n- We observed APT41 using a compromised account to create a scheduled task on a system, write\n\na binary component of HIGHNOON containing the payload and C&C information to disk, and then\nmodify the legitimate Windows WMI Performance Adaptor (wmiApSrv) to execute the HIGHNOON\npayload.\n\nAPT41 frequently uses the publicly available utility WMIEXEC to move laterally across an environment.\nWMIEXEC is a tool that allows for the execution of WMI commands on remote machines. Examples of\ncommands executed by the utility include:\n\n\ncmd.exe /c whoami > C:\\wmi.dll 2>&1\ncmd.exe /c del C:\\wmi.dll /F > nul 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /c a.bat > C:\\wmi.dll 2>&1\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Maintain\n Presence\n\n\nTo maintain presence, APT41 relies on backdoors, a Sticky Keys vulnerability, scheduled tasks, bootkits,\nrootkits, registry modifications, and creating or modifying startup files. APT41 has also been observed\nmodifying firewall rules to enable file and printer sharing to allow for inbound Server Message Block (SMB)\ntraffic.\n\n\n\n- APT41 leveraged ROCKBOOT as a persistence mechanism for PHOTO and TERA backdoors. The\n\nbootkit performs raw disk operations to bypass the typical MBR boot sequence and execute the\nbackdoors prior to the host operating system. This technique was implemented to ensure the\nmalware would execute at system runtime and was designed to be difficult to detect and prevent.\nAPT41 ROCKBOOT samples have been signed with legitimate code-signing certificates from MGame\nand Neowiz, two South Korean video game companies.\n\n- APT41 leveraged ADORE.XSEC, a Linux backdoor launched by the Adore-NG rootkit, throughout\n\nan organization's Linux environment. The group installed the backdoor and the Adore-NG rootkit\npersistently by creating a hidden shell script in \"/etc/rc.d/init.d,\" a directory that contains the\nstartup scripts for many system services. The Adore-NG rootkit is used to hide the backdoor and\nauthenticate any incoming connections using a provided password.\n\n- The group also uses CROSSWALK.BIN, FRONTWHEEL, HIGHNOON.BIN, HIGHNOON.LINUX,\n\nHOMEUNIX, and PACMAN to maintain presence.\n\nIn some instances, APT41 leveraged POISONPLUG as a first-stage backdoor to deploy the HIGHNOON\nbackdoor in the targeted environment. We observed APT41 use PowerSploit with the capability to\nuse WMI as a persistence mechanism. The group also deploys the SOGU and CROSSWALK malware\nfamilies as means to maintain presence.\n\nAPT41 has demonstrated it is highly agile, responding quickly to changes in victim environments and\nincident responder activity.\n\n- Hours after a victimized organization made changes to thwart APT41, the group registered a new C&C\n\ndomain, compiled a new SOGU backdoor variant, and deployed the new backdoor to several systems\nacross multiple geographic regions.\n\n- APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to multiple HR employees three days after the compromise\n\nhad been remediated and systems were brought back online. Within hours of a user opening the\nmalicious attachment dropping a HOMEUNIX backdoor, APT41 regained a foothold within the\nenvironment by installing PHOTO on the organization's servers across multiple geographic regions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Avoiding C&C Detection\nAt times APT41 uses legitimate websites, such as GitHub,\nPastebin, and Microsoft TechNet, to avoid detection.\nInterestingly, some of the group's POISONPLUG malware samples\nleverage the Steam Community website associated with Valve,\na video game developer and publisher. This technique of storing\nencoded or encrypted strings, known as dead drop resolvers\n(DDR), on legitimate websites that can subvert network defenders\nas traffic to and from the sites is typically benign.\n\nThe group has also configured Linux backdoors to run on ports\nused by legitimate applications within victim environments,\nenabling malicious traffic to bypass network security measures\nand hide malicious activity within the organization's regular\napplication traffic.\n\n\n###### Preventing Anti-Virus Updates\nBefore attempting to deploy the publicly available Ransomwareas-a-Service (RaaS) Encryptor RaaS through group policy, APT41\nblocked victim systems from retrieving anti-virus updates by\naccessing the DNS management console and implementing a\nforward lookup on the domain used for anti-virus updates to the\npark IP address \"1.1.1.1.\"\n\n\n#### Complete\n Mission\n\n\nAPT41 has been observed creating a RAR archive of targeted files for exfiltration. The group has\nalso manipulated in-game currencies using the targets' databases after compromising production\nenvironments. During multiple engagements, APT41 attempted to remove evidence of some of its\nactivity by deleting Bash histories, clearing Windows security and system events, and modifying DNS\nmanagement to avoid anti-virus detections.\n\nIn at least one instance, the group attempted to deploy Encryptor RaaS. However, an operator's typo\nprevented the ransomware from executing in the victim's environment.\n\nIn another instance, APT41 deployed XMRig, a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool in a victim's\nenvironment.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TECHNICAL ANNEX\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n\n\n**Initial Access**\n\n\n**Persistence**\n\n\nt1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application\n\n\nt1015 Accessibility Features\n\n\nt1133 External Remote Services\n\nt1193 Spear-phishing Attachment\n\nt1195 Supply Chain Compromise\n\nt1199 Trusted Relationship\n\nt1078 Valid Accounts\n\n\n**Execution**\n\n\nt1059 Command-Line Interface\n\n\nt1223 Compiled HTML File\n\nt1106 Execution through API\n\nt1129 Execution through Module Load\n\nt1203 Exploitation for Client Execution\n\nt1061 Graphical User Interface\n\nt1170 Mshta\n\nt1086 PowerShell\n\nt1053 Scheduled Task\n\nt1085 Rundll32\n\nt1064 Scripting\n\nt1035 Service Execution\n\nt1204 User Execution\n\nt1047 Windows Management Instrumentation\n\n\nt1098 Account Manipulation\n\nt1067 Bootkit\n\nt1136 Create Account\n\nt1038 DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nt1133 External Remote Services\n\nt1179 Hooking\n\nt1031 Modify Existing Service\n\nt1050 New Service\n\nt1034 Path Interception\n\nt1108 Redundant Access\n\nt1060 Registry Run Keys / Start Folder\n\nt1165 Startup Items\n\nt1078 Valid Accounts\n\n\nt1134 Access Token Manipulation\n\nt1015 Accessibility Features\n\nt1038 DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nt1034 Path Interception\n\nt1055 Process Injection\n\nt1078 Valid Accounts\n\n\nt1100 Web Shell\n\n\n**Privilege Escalation**\n\n\nt1100 Web Shell\n\n\n-----\n\n**Defense Evasion**\n\n\n**Discovery**\n\n\nt1134 Access Token Manipulation\n\n\nt1087 Account Discovery\n\n\nt1009 Binary Padding\n\nt1146 Clear Command History\n\nt1116 Code Signing\n\nt1140 Deobfuscate / Decode Files or Information\n\nt1089 Disabling Security Tools\n\nt1038 DLL Search Order Hijacking\n\nt1073 DLL Side-Loading\n\nt1107 File Deletion\n\nt1054 Indicator Blocking\n\nt1070 Indicator Removal on Host\n\nt1036 Masquerading\n\nt1112 Modify Registry\n\nt1170 Mshta\n\nt1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nt1055 Process Injection\n\nt1014 Rootkit\n\nt1085 Rundll32\n\nt1064 Scripting\n\nt1045 Software Packing\n\nt1099 Timestomp\n\nt1078 Valid Accounts\n\nt1497 Virtualization and Sandbox Evasion\n\nt1102 Web Service\n\n\nt1482 Domain Trust Discovery\n\nt1083 File and Directory Discovery\n\nt1069 Permission Groups Discovery\n\nt1057 Process Discovery\n\nt1063 Security Software Discovery\n\nt1082 System Information Discovery\n\nt1016 System Network Configuration Discovery\n\nt0149 System Network Connections Discovery\n\nt1033 System Owner/User Discovery\n\nt1124 System Time Discovery\n\nt1497 Virtualization and Sandbox Evasion\n\n\nt1090 Connection Proxy\n\nt1094 Custom Command and Control Protocol\n\nt1132 Data Encoding\n\nt1001 Data Obfuscation\n\nt1483 Domain Generation Algorithms\n\nt1219 Remote Access Tools\n\nt1105 Remote File Copy\n\nt1071 Standard Application Layer Protocol\n\nt1032 Standard Cryptographic Protocol\n\nt1095 Standard Non-Application Layer Protocol\n\nt1065 Uncommonly Used Port\n\n\n**Lateral Movement**\n\n\nt1075 Pass the Hash\n\n\nt1076 Remote Desktop Protocol\n\n\nt1105 Remote File Copy\n\n\n**Command and Control**\n\n\nt1043 Commonly Used Port\n\n\n**Credential Access**\n\n\nt1098 Account Manipulation\n\n\nt1110 Brute Force\n\nt1003 Credential Dumping\n\nt1081 Credentials in Files\n\nt1056 Input Capture\n\nt1145 Private Keys\n\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\n\n**Collection**\n\n\nt1002 Data Compressed\n\n\nt1119 Automated Collection\n\n\nt1022 Data Encrypted\n\n\nt1213 Data from Information Repositories\n\nt1005 Data from Local System\n\nt1056 Input Capture\n\n\nt1041 Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel\n\n\n**Impact**\n\n\nt1113 Screen Capture\n\n\nt1487 Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TECHNICAL ANNEX\n\n## Code-Signing Certificates\n Used by APT41\n\n\n**TABLE 14.
