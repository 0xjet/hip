    "plain_text": "# DesignativeDave/androrat: Remote Administration Tool for Android devices\n\n**github.com/DesignativeDave/androrat**\n\nDesignativeDave\n\n## androrat\n\nRemote Administration Tool for Android\n\nAndrorat is a client/server application developed in Java Android for the client side and in\nJava/Swing for the Server.\n\nThe name Androrat is a mix of Android and RAT (Remote Access Tool).\n\nIt has been developed in a team of 4 for a university project. It has been realised in one\nmonth. The goal of the application is to give the control of the android system remotely and\nretrieve informations from it.\n\n## Technical matters\n\nThe android application is the client for the server which receive all the connections.\nThe android application run as a service(not an activity) that is started during the boot.\nSo the user does not need to interact with the service (Even though there is a debug\nactivity that allow to configure the IP and the port to connect to).\nThe connection to the server can be triggered by a SMS or a call (this can be\nconfigured)\n\n\n-----\n\n### All the available functionalities are\n\nGet contacts (and all theirs informations)\nGet call logs\nGet all messages\nLocation by GPS/Network\nMonitoring received messages in live\nMonitoring phone state in live (call received, call sent, call missed..)\nTake a picture from the camera\nStream sound from microphone (or other sources..)\nStreaming video (for activity based client only)\nDo a toast\nSend a text message\nGive call\nOpen an URL in the default browser\nDo vibrate the phone\n\n## Folders\n\nThe project contains the following folders:\n\ndoc: Will soonly contain all the documentation about the project\nExperiment: Contain an experimental version of the client articulated around an activity\nwish allow by the way to stream video\nsrc/Androrat: Contain the source code of the client that should be put on the android\nplateform\nsrc/AndroratServer: Contain the sources of the Java/Swing server that can be run on\nany plateform\nsrc/api: Contain all the different api used in the project (JMapViewer for the map, forms\nfor swing, and vlcj for video streaming)\nsrc/InOut: Contain the code of the content common for the client and the server which\nis basically the protocol implementation\n\n## Screenshots\n\n Main GUI\n\nThis is the main GUI where all the clients connected appears. The list is dynamically updated\nwhen a new client connects or is disconnected. Moreover a log of all connections and global\ninformations are showed in the log panel at the bottom of the window. A simple double-click\non a client open his window to interact with him.\n\n[Main GUI](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/976ef5914fe4bfc21dfc852eaab19de6d590dc2dc2def149d7762142cfb970fc/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f526f62696e44617669642f616e64726f7261742f6d61737465722f646f632f6d61696e2e706e67)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Client Panel\n\nAll the actions with client can be made in the client window which is articulated around tabs.\nThe default tab is called Home and provide various functionalities. First as we can see in the\nleft scrollview all the informations about the client like sim infos, battery infos, network infos,\nsensors infos etc. On the right there is the options which allow remotely to change the\nconfiguration of the client like the ip and port to connect to, either or not wait a trigger to\nintent server connection etc. Finally quick actions can be perfomed in this tab like a toast\nmessage, do vibrate the phone or open an URL.\n\n[Client Panel](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e573cc3cf7603d647b82ce65ec96532487430fde509246f9d59003e0363cc945/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f526f62696e44617669642f616e64726f7261742f6d61737465722f646f632f686f6d6570616e656c2e706e67)\n\n## Other tabs\n\nThe two screenshots below shows two others tabs for two functionalities which are\nrespectively get contacts and geolocation. As you can see on the get contacts panel the list\non the left show all contacts the name, the phone number and the picture if available.\nMorevover on the right three buttons allow to get more information about the selected\ncontact send him a sms or call him. For Geolocation we can choose our provider either GPS\neither network that use google to locate. Then the streaming can be started and the map will\nbe updated as soon as data has been received.\n\n[Contacts](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3fee2f8186e1f51d59850d358da092293cba1a27e9751bb517333f54155794e6/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f526f62696e44617669642f616e64726f7261742f6d61737465722f646f632f636f6e746163742e706e67)\n\n[GPS tab](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ec501eee8838252a1e46d6944c50da3f02f0fc5205fb52afa74af000c6837a8b/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f526f62696e44617669642f616e64726f7261742f6d61737465722f646f632f6770732e706e67)\n\n\n-----",
