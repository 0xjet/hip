Mandiant Threat Intelligence has tracked several loader and backdoor campaigns that\n[lead to the post-compromise deployment of ransomware, sometimes within 24 hours of initial compromise. Effective and fast detection of these](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/18/ryuk-in-5-hours/)\ncampaigns is key to mitigating this threat.\n\nThe malware families enabling these attacks previously reported by Mandiant to intelligence subscribers include KEGTAP/BEERBOT,\nSINGLEMALT/STILLBOT and WINEKEY/CORKBOT. While these malware families communicate with the same command and control\ninfrastructure (C2) and are close to functional parity, there are minimal code overlaps across them. Other security researchers have tracked\n[these malware families under the names BazarLoader and BazarBackdoor or](https://www.vkremez.com/2020/04/lets-learn-trickbot-bazarbackdoor.html) [Team9.](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/02/in-depth-analysis-of-the-new-team9-malware-family/)\n\nThe operators conducting these campaigns have actively targeted hospitals, retirement communities, and medical centers, even in the midst of\na global health crisis, demonstrating a clear disregard for human life.\n\n**Email Campaign TTPs**\n\nCampaigns distributing KEGTAP, SINGLEMALT and WINEKEY have been sent to individuals at organizations across a broad range of\nindustries and geographies using a series of shifting delivery tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). Despite the frequent changes seen\nacross these campaigns, the following has remained consistent across recent activity:\n\nEmails contain an in-line link to an actor-controlled Google Docs document, typically a PDF file.\nThis document contains an in-line link to a URL hosting a malware payload.\nEmails masquerade as generic corporate communications, including follow-ups about documents and phone calls or emails crafted to\nappear related to complaints, terminations, bonuses, contracts, working schedules, surveys or queries about business hours.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo e e a co u cat o s a e c uded t e ec p e t s a e o e p oye a e t e subject e a d/o e a body\n\nDespite this uniformity, the associated TTPs have otherwise changed regularly—both between campaigns and across multiple spam runs seen\nin the same day. Notable ways that these campaigns have varied over time include:\n\nEarly campaigns were delivered via Sendgrid and included in-line links to Sendgrid URLs that would redirect users to attacker-created\nGoogle documents. In contrast, recent campaigns have been delivered via attacker-controlled or compromised email infrastructure and\nhave commonly contained in-line links to attacker-created Google documents, although they have also used links associated with the\nConstant Contact service.\nThe documents loaded by these in-line links are crafted to appear somewhat relevant to the theme of the email campaign and contain\nadditional links along with instructions directing users to click on them. When clicked, these links download malware binaries with file\nnames masquerading as document files. Across earlier campaigns these malware binaries were hosted on compromised infrastructure,\nhowever, the attackers have shifted to hosting their malware on legitimate web services, including Google Drive, Basecamp, Slack,\nTrello, Yougile, and JetBrains.\nIn recent campaigns, the malware payloads have been hosted on numerous URLs associated with one or more of these legitimate\nservices. In cases where the payloads have been taken down, the actors have sometimes updated their Google documents to contain\nnew, working links.\nSome campaigns have also incorporated customization, including emails with internal references to the recipients’ organizations (Figure\n1) and organizations’ logos embedded into the Google Docs documents (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail containing internal references to target an organization s name\n\n\nan organization’s name\n\n\nFigure 1: Email containing internal references to target\n\nFigure 2: Google Docs PDF\n\n|an organization’s name|Google Docs PDF document containing a target organization’s logo|\n|---|---|\n\n\ndocument containing a target organization’s logo\nHiding the final payload behind multiple links is a simple yet effective way to bypass some email filtering technologies. Various technologies\nhave the ability to follow links in an email to try to identify malware or malicious domains; however, the number of links followed can vary.\nAdditionally, embedding links within a PDF document further makes automated detection and link-following difficult.\n\n**Post-Compromise TTPs**\n\n\n-----\n\nG e t e poss b ty t at accesses obta ed o t ese ca pa g s ay be p o ded to a ous ope ato s to o et e, t e atte stage s,\nincluding ransomware family deployed, may vary across intrusions. A notable majority of cases where Mandiant has had visibility into these\npost-compromise TTPs have been attributable to UNC1878, a financially motivated actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of\nRYUK ransomware.\n\n_Establish Foothold_\n\nOnce the loader and backdoor have been executed on the initial victim host, the actors have used this initial backdoor to download\nPOWERTRICK and/or Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads to establish a foothold. Notably, the respective loader and backdoor as well as\nPOWERTRICK have typically been installed on a small number of hosts in observed incidents, suggesting these payloads may be reserved for\nestablishing a foothold and performing initial network and host reconnaissance. However, BEACON is frequently found on a larger number of\nhosts and used throughout various stages of the attack lifecycle.\n\n_Maintain Presence_\n\nBeyond the preliminary phases of each intrusion, we have seen variations in how these attackers have maintained presence after establishing\nan initial foothold or moving laterally within a network. In addition to the use of common post-exploitation frameworks such as Cobalt Strike,\nMetasploit and EMPIRE, we have observed the use of other backdoors, including ANCHOR, that we also believe to be under control of the\nactors behind TrickBot.\n\nThe loaders associated with this activity can maintain persistence through reboot by using at least four different techniques, including\ncreating a scheduled task, adding itself to the startup folder as a shortcut, creating a scheduled Microsoft BITS job using\n/setnotifycmdline, and adding itself to the Userinit value under the following registry key:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon.\nActors have downloaded POWERTRICK, Metasploit Meterpreter, and Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads following the initial compromise.\nBEACON payloads have commonly been executed after moving laterally to new hosts within the victim network. The attackers have\nemployed Cobalt Strike payloads crafted to maintain persistence through reboot via a scheduled task on critical systems in victim\nenvironments. Notably, BEACON is the backdoor observed most frequently across these incidents.\nWe have observed actors executing encoded PowerShell commands that ultimately executed instances of the PowerShell\nEMPIRE backdoor.\n[The actors were observed using BEACON to execute PowerLurk's Register-MaliciousWmiEvent cmdlet to register WMI events used to](https://github.com/Sw4mpf0x/PowerLurk)\nkill processes related to security tools and utilities, including Task Manager, WireShark, TCPView, ProcDump, Process Explorer, Process\nMonitor, NetStat, PSLoggedOn, LogonSessions, Process Hacker, Autoruns, AutorunsSC, RegEdit, and RegShot.\nIn at least once case, attackers have maintained access to a victim environment using stolen credentials to access corporate VPN\ninfrastructure configured to require only single-factor authentication.\n\n_Escalate Privileges_\n\nThe most commonly observed methods for escalating privileges in these incidents have involved the use of valid credentials. The actors used\na variety of techniques for accessing credentials stored in memory or on disk to access privileged accounts.\n\nThe actors used valid credentials obtained using MimiKatz variants to escalate privileges. We’ve observed Mimikatz being executed both\nfrom the file system of victim hosts and via PowerShell cmdlets executed via Cobalt Strike BEACON.\nActors have gained access to credentials via exported copies of the ntds.dit Active Directory database and SYSTEM and\nSECURITY registry hives from a Domain Controller.\nIn multiple instances, the actors have launched attacks against Kerberos, including the use of RUBEUS, the MimiKatz Kerberos module,\nand the Invoke-Kerberoast cmdlet.\n\n_Reconnaissance_\n\nThe approaches taken to perform host and network reconnaissance across these incidents varied; however, a significant portion of observed\nreconnaissance activity has revolved around Activity Directory enumeration using publicly available utilities such as BLOODHOUND,\nSHARPHOUND or ADFind, as well as the execution of PowerShell cmdlets using Cobalt Strike BEACON.\n\n\n-----\n\nCO as bee sta ed o a a ge u be o syste s ac oss t ese t us o s a d as bee used to e ecute a ous\nreconnaissance commands including both built-in host commands and PowerShell cmdlets. Observed PowerShell cmdlets include:\n\nGet-GPPPassword\nInvoke-AllChecks\nInvoke-BloodHound\nInvoke-EternalBlue\nInvoke-FileFinder\nInvoke-HostRecon\nInvoke-Inveigh\nInvoke-Kerberoast\nInvoke-LoginPrompt\nInvoke-mimikittenz\nInvoke-ShareFinder\nInvoke-UserHunter\nMandiant has observed actors using POWERTRICK to execute built-in system commands on the initial victim host,\nincluding ipconfig, findstr, and cmd.exe.\nThe actors leveraged publicly available utilities Adfind, BLOODHOUND, SHARPHOUND, and KERBRUTE on victim networks to collect\nActive Directory information and credentials.\nWMIC commands have been used to perform host reconnaissance, including listing installed software, listing running processes, and\nidentifying operating system and system architecture.\nThe actors have used a batch script to ping all servers identified during Active Directory enumeration and output the results to res.txt.\nThe actors used the Nltest command to list domain controllers.\n\n_Lateral Movement_\n\nLateral movement was most commonly accomplished using valid credentials in combination with Cobalt Strike BEACON, RDP and SMB, or\nusing the same backdoors used to establish a foothold in victim networks.\n\nThe actors have regularly leveraged Cobalt Strike BEACON and Metasploit Meterpreter to move laterally within victim environments.\nThe actors commonly moved laterally within victim environments using compromised accounts—both those belonging to regular users\nand accounts with administrative privileges. In addition to the use of common post-exploitation frameworks, lateral movement has also\nbeen achieved using WMIC commands and the Windows RDP and SMB protocols.\nThe actors used the Windows net use command to connect to Windows admin shares to move laterally.\n\n_Complete Mission_\n\nMandiant is directly aware of incidents involving KEGTAP that included the post-compromise deployment of RYUK ransomware. We have also\nobserved instances where ANCHOR infections, another backdoor associated with the same actors, preceded CONTI or MAZE deployment.\n\nIn at least one case, an executable was observed that was designed to exfiltrate files via SFTP to an attacker-controlled server.\nThe actors have used Cobalt Strike BEACON to exfiltrate data created through network reconnaissance activities as well as user files.\nThe actors were observed deleting their tools from victim hosts in an attempt to remove indicators of compromise.\nThe actors have used their access to the victim network to deploy ransomware payloads. There is evidence to suggest that RYUK\nransomware was likely deployed via PsExec, but other scripts or artifacts related to the distribution process were not available for\nforensic analysis.\n\n**Hunting Strategies**\n\nIf an organization identifies a host with an active infection believed to be an instance of KEGTAP or a parallel malware family, the following\ncontainment actions are recommended. Note that due to the velocity of this intrusion activity, these actions should be taken in parallel.\n\nIsolate and perform a forensic review of any impacted systems.\nReview incoming emails to the user that owns the impacted device for emails matching the distribution campaigns, and take action to\nremove the messages from all mailboxes.\nIdentify the URLs used by the phishing campaign and block them using proxy or network security devices.\nReset credentials for any user accounts associated with execution of the malware.\nPerform an enterprise wide review for lateral movement authentication from the impacted systems.\nCheck authentication logs from any single-factor remote access solutions that may exist (VPN, VDI, etc) and move towards multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA) as soon as possible.\n\nAn enterprise-wide effort should be made to identify host-based artifacts related to the execution of first-stage malware and all post-intrusion\nactivity associated with this activity. Some baseline approaches to this have been captured as follows.\n\nActivity associated with the KEGTAP loader can often be identified via a review of system startup folders and Userinit values under the\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon registry key.\n\n\n-----\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\adobe.lnk\n\nFigure 3: Example LNK file associated with KEGTAP persistence within a system’s startup folders\n\nSINGLEMALT employs BITS to maintain persistence through reboot and can often be identified via a review of anomalous BITS jobs.\nSINGLEMALT uses a well-documented BITS persistence mechanism that intentionally creates a job to download a non-existent URL, which\nwill trigger a failure event. The job is set to retry on a regular interval, thus ensuring the malware continues to run. To review the BITS job on a\nhost run the command bitsadmin /list.\n\nDisplay name may be “Adobe Update”, “System autoupdate” or another generic value.\nNotify state may be set to Fail (Status 2).\nFileList URL value may be set to the local host or a URL that does not exist.\nThe Notification Command Line value may contain the path to the SINGLEMALT sample and/or a command to move it to a new location\nthen start it.\nThe Retry Delay value will be set.\n\nWINEKEY maintains persistence through reboot via the use of registry RUN keys. Searching for anomalous RUN keys enterprise-wide can\nhelp to identify systems impacted by this malware.\n\nKey: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Backup Mgr\n\nValue: Path to the backdoor\n\nFigure 4: Example registry RUN key used by WINEKEY to maintain persistence\n\nThe ANCHOR backdoor has been seen across a subset of intrusions associated with this activity and can often be identified via the scheduled\ntasks it uses to maintain persistence through reboot. The scheduled tasks created by ANCHOR are often unnamed, although that is not always\nthe case.\n\nThe identification of named scheduled tasks associated with ANCHOR persistence may be constructed according to the following\npattern: <Random directory within %APPDATA%> autoupdate#<random number>.\nAll unnamed scheduled tasks should be reviewed, particularly those with a creation date consistent with the time of the suspected\ncompromise.\n\nAlthough it is a low fidelity indicator, ANCHOR activity may also sometimes be identified by searching for binaries within the\nC:\\Windows\\SysWOW64 directory that have a file name matching the following pattern: <8 random lowercase chars>.exe. Stacking or sorting\non file creation timestamps in the C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64 directory may also help identify malicious files, as the directory should be mostly\nstatic.\n\nPost-exploitation activity associated with the deployment of ransomware following these campaigns is typically conducted using the Cobalt\nStrike attack framework. The BEACON payload associated with Cobalt Strike can often be identified via a review of existing registered\nservices and service creation events (Event ID 7045), both markers of the mechanism it most commonly employs to maintain persistence.\n\nThe following are additional strategies that may aid in identifying associated activity:\n\nOrganizations can review web proxy logs in order to identify HXXP requests for file storage, project management, collaboration or\ncommunication services with a referrer from a Google Docs document.\nDuring the associated post-compromise activity, attackers have commonly staged their tools and data in the PerfLogs directory and C$\nshare.\nWhile collecting data used to enable later-stage operations, the attackers commonly leave instances of ntds.dit and exports of the\nSYSTEM and SECURITY registry hives on impacted systems.\n\n**Hardening Strategies**\n\nThe actions taken by the actors to escalate privileges and move laterally in an environment use well-documented techniques that search the\nnetwork and Active Directory for common misconfigurations that expose credentials and systems for abuse. Organizations can take steps to\n[limit the impact and effectiveness of these techniques. For more in-depth recommendations see our ransomware protection white paper.](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/current-threats/pdfs/wp-ransomware-protection-and-containment-strategies.pdf)\n\nHarden service accounts against brute force and password guessing attacks. Most organizations have at least a few service accounts\nwith passwords set to never expire. These passwords are likely old and insecure. Make a best effort to reset as many of these accounts\nas possible to long and complex passwords. In cases where it is possible, migrate to MSAs and gMSAS for automated rotation.\nPrevent the usage of privileged accounts for lateral movement. Use GPOs to restrict the ability for privileged accounts such as Domain\nAdministrators and privileged service accounts from initiating RDP connections and network logins.Actors often pick just a few accounts\nto use for RDP; by limiting the number of potential accounts, you provide detection opportunities and opportunities to slow the actor.\n\n\n-----\n\noc te et access o se e s e e poss b e O te t es t e e s o bus ess eed o se e s, espec a y ast uctu e\nsystems, to access the Internet. The actors often choose high-uptime servers for the deployment of post-exploitation tools such as\nBEACON.\nBlock uncategorized and newly registered domains using web proxies or DNS filters. Often the final payload delivered via phishing is\nhosted on a compromised third-party website that do not have a business categorization.\nEnsure that critical patches are installed on Windows systems as well as network infrastructure. We have observed attackers exploiting\nwell-known vulnerabilities such as Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) to escalate privileges in an environment prior to deploying ransomware.\nIn other cases, possibly unrelated to UNC1878, we have observed threat actors gain access to an environment through vulnerable VPN\ninfrastructure before deploying ransomware.\n\n[For more intelligence on ransomware and other threats, please register for Mandiant Advantage Free, a no-cost version of our threat](https://www.fireeye.com/advantage/)\n[intelligence platform.
