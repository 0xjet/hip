After a client is infected, criminals use this backdoor access to send\nfollow-up malware, scan the environment and exploit other vulnerable hosts on the network.\n\nThe threat actor behind BazarLoader uses different methods to distribute this malware to potential\n[victims. In early February 2021, researchers began reporting a call center-based method of](https://twitter.com/ffforward/status/1356571665648537601)\ndistributing BazarLoader. This method utilizes emails with a trial subscription-based theme that\nencourages potential victims to call a phone number. A call center operator then answers and\ndirects victims to a website to unsubscribe from the service. Call center operators offer to personally\nguide victims through a process designed to infect vulnerable computers with BazarLoader. An\n[example of the process can be found in this YouTube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAkeXCYcl4Y)\n\n\n-----\n\nThis call center-based process of infecting computers with BazarLoader has been dubbed the\n\"BazarCall\" method (sometimes referred to as \"BazaCall\" method).\n\n[Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from this threat with a](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) Threat\nPrevention security subscription.\n\n## Chain of Events for Infections Using the BazarCall Method\n\nBazarCall infections follow a distinct pattern of activity. See Figure 1 for a flow chart showing the\nchain of events.\n\nFigure 1. BazarCall chain of events\nChain of Events for an Infection Using the BazarCall Method:\n\nA trial subscription-themed email with a phone number to a call center for assistance.\nVictim calls the phone number from the email.\nCall center operator guides the victim to a fake company website.\nVictim downloads a Microsoft Excel file from the website.\nThe call center operator instructs the victim to enable macros on the downloaded Excel file.\nThe vulnerable Windows computer is infected with BazarLoader malware.\nThe call center operator then tells the victim that the unsubscription is successful.\nBazarLoader generates command and control (C2) traffic from the infected Windows host.\nBackdoor access through BazarLoader leads to post-infection activities.\n\nThese emails state that the victim’s trial subscription is ending, and the victim’s credit card will be\ncharged. Phone numbers in these emails change at least daily, and occasionally we have seen two\nor more numbers appear during a single day.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Posing as A Victim\n\nA video has been posted on YouTube documenting someone posing as a victim and having a center\noperator guide them through the fake unsubscription process. We contacted this call center on at\nleast five different occasions, and the operator was a different person each time. All operators were\nseemingly non-native English speakers. Two of the operators were female, and three were male.\nEach operator followed the same basic script, but there were variations.\n\nThe following conversation took place on Wednesday, April 14, 2021 using a phone number from\nthe email shown below in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Email used by the person posing as a victim.\nOperator: Customer service. How may I help you?\n\n\n-----\n\nVictim: Hi. I got an email today from a company called Paradise Books. It says I have a subscription,\nand my credit card will be charged. But I've never dealt with Paradise Books. I don't remember doing\nanything or going to a website for Paradise Books or anything like that.\n\nOperator: Okay, sir. Do you have a subscription number?\n\nVictim: Yes, hold on. It's 040*********. [Note: The last 9 digits of this number are purposely not shown\n_here because this number identifies the recipient's email address.]_\n\nOperator: Okay, I can repeat that back to you. It is 040*********.\n\nVictim: Yes.\n\nOperator: Yes sir, just hold on a moment let me check our system.\n\nVictim: Okay.\n\n_[hold music]_\n\nOperator: Hello?\n\nVictim: Yes.\n\nOperator: Okay. It seems this account was opened by John Edwards, but your email starts with\n\n_[victim's first name]._\n\nVictim: Yes, I'm [victim's first name]. I don't know any John Edwards.\n\nOperator: Okay, sir. You'll need to cancel the subscription. So what you need to do is go to\nworldbooks dot US.\n\nOperator: Worldbooks [states each letter phonetically] dot US.\n\nVictim: Hold on a second. Let me get that in my web browser.\n\nOperator: Yes? Can I read it back again?\n\nVictim: No thank you. I have it. [typing sounds]\n\nOperator: Hello?\n\nVictim: Yes, hold on. It looks like it's loading.\n\nOperator: Have you seen the website yet?\n\nVictim: Okay, here we go. It says \"World Books.\" So I've got a web page. I've never seen this site\nbefore.\n\nOperator: No problem. We can just cancel the subscription. What you need is your subscriber\nnumber that you told me earlier.\n\nVictim: Okay\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. BazarCall website from April 14, 2021.\nOperator: Can you see the subscribe button?\n\nVictim: Yes.\n\nOperator: When you click on that, you should be able to see unsubscribe.\n\nVictim: Okay, I'm clicking the subscribe button.\n\nOperator: Can you see unsubscribe?\n\nVictim: I see a line that says, \"Do you want to unsubscribe?\"\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. BazarCall website subscribe page with link to unsubscribe.\nOperator: That is where you need to go. Can you click it?\n\nVictim: Okay.\n\nOperator: And then you enter the subscription number.\n\nVictim: Gotcha. [typing sounds]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. BazarCall website unsubscribe page.\nOperator: Once you do that, you will receive a confirmation document.\n\nVictim: Okay, it's asking me what do I want to do with subscription 16184 something XLSB?\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. BazarCall website unsubscribe page returns an Excel file.\nOperator: That is the confirmation document. That's where you have your confirmation code.\n\nVictim: Should I open it? Should I save it? Or what?\n\nOperator: You can open it, if you need the confirmation. The confirmation code is important. In case\nanything happens, you can call us and give us the confirmation code.\n\nVictim: Okay.\n\nOperator: So we can solve the issue.\n\nVictim: Gotcha. Alright.\n\nOperator: Did you get it?\n\nVictim: Alright. I'm opening it right now. I see Excel Office 365. This document is protected.\nPreviewing is not available for protected documents. I have to press enable.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Screenshot of Excel file downloaded from BazarCall website.\nOperator: Click editing and enable content.\n\nVictim: Okay. [pauses] Alright. The spreadsheet changed. [pauses] It shows a form with a company\nname, first name, last name, birthdate, and all that stuff.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Excel file after enabling macros. Note the different filename on the title bar.\nOperator: Okay, can you see the code? The code is the important one.\n\nVictim: I don't see a code, no.\n\nOperator: Okay. There are different pages. Can you see the next page?\n\nVictim: Where is this code supposed to be?\n\nOperator: There is a confirmation code in case you don't want to get charged but in case you get\ncharged, that is what you call us with in order to cancel the charge.\n\nVictim: Okay, I still don't know where I'm supposed to find this code.\n\nOperator: Just hold on and let me check with the department of IT.\n\nVictim: Okay.\n\n_[hold music for approximately 1 minute]_\n\nOperator: Hello sir.\n\n\n-----\n\nVictim: Yes.\n\nOperator: I've checked with the IT department, and they are saying that the cancellation went\nthrough correctly. We are just having an issue with our servers, but the cancellation went through\nsuccessfully.\n\nVictim: Okay.\n\nOperator: So nothing will be charged to your account. And they've given me a code on their end.\nCan I read it to you?\n\nVictim: Yes.\n\nOperator: The code is [spells out seven characters of an alpha-numeric code].\n\nVictim: Okay.\n\nOperator: In case of any problem, you can just call back and give us that code. We will be able to\nresolve any issue.\n\nVictim: Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator: You're welcome sir. And if you call back, you can ask for [operator's first name], because\nwe have many [garbled].\n\n_[Victim repeats operator's first name]_\n\nOperator: Yes, that's my name.\n\nVictim: Alright, well thank you.\n\nOperator: Have a good day.\n\nVictim: Goodbye.\n\nOperator: Goodbye sir.\n\n## Infection Traffic\n\nAfter macros are enabled on the downloaded Excel file, the BazarLoader DLL is dropped, and it\n[generates a URL containing the string campo. This type of URL is called Campo Loader, which acts](https://fr3d.hk/blog/campo-loader-simple-but-effective)\nas a gateway that redirects traffic to malware. Some examples of Campo Loader URLs generated\nby a BazarLoader DLL are shown below in Table 1.\n\n**Date** **URL**\n\n2021-03-25 hxxp://whynt[.]xyz/campo/w/w\n\n2021-03-29 hxxp://veso2[.]xyz/campo/r/r1\n\n2021-03-31 hxxp://about2[.]xyz/campo/a/a1\n\n\n-----\n\n2021-04-07 hxxp://basket2[.]xyz/campo/u/u1\n\n2021-04-08 hxxp://dance4[.]xyz/campo/d8/d9\n\n2021-04-14 hxxp://glass3[.]xyz/campo/gl/gl3\n\n2021-04-15 hxxp://idea5[.]xyz/campo/id/id8\n\n2021-04-16 hxxp://keep2[.]xyz/campo/jl/jl7\n\n_Table 1.

Recent URLs for BazarLoader malware._\n\nThe BazarLoader executable generates HTTPS C2 traffic noted below in Figure 10.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Traffic from the BazarLoader infection.\n\n## Forensics on Infected Windows Host\n\nThis section describes forensics on an infected Windows host from April 14, 2021. SHA256 hash for\nthe downloaded spreadsheet is:\n\ndb53f42e13d2685bd34dbc5c79fad637c9344e72e210ca05504420874e98c2a6\n\nMacros from the downloaded Excel file create artifacts in the Windows computer’s C:\\Users\\Public\ndirectory as shown in Figure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Artifacts were created after enabling macros from the downloaded Excel file on April 14,\n2021\nFile information is shown below in Table 3. The first two are text files with the same SHA256 hash.\nThe other file is a BazarLoader DLL.\n\n\n**File name** **File**\n**type**\n\n130486.xlsb ASCII\ntext\n\n130486.dot ASCII\ntext\n\n\n**SHA256 hash**\n\n2632c0cc222a6d436b50a418605a7bd4fa8f363ab8d93d10b831cdb28a2ac1bc\n\n2632c0cc222a6d436b50a418605a7bd4fa8f363ab8d93d10b831cdb28a2ac1bc\n\n\n130486.pgj DLL f3b5cf1e40aed4567a8996cf107285907d432b4bc8cc3d0b46aae628813d82d4\n\n_Table 3. Artifacts from a BazarCall spreadsheet seen on April 14, 2021._\n\n130486.xlsb and 130486.dot consist of an American Standard Code For Information Interchange\n(ASCII) string with base64 text. This text represents the BazarLoader dynamic link library (DLL) file.\nMacro code from the downloaded Excel file converts the base64 text to a DLL named 130486.pgj\nand runs this DLL using the following script commands:\n\ncmd.exe /c certutil -decode %PUBLIC%\\130486.dot %PUBLIC%\\130486.pgj\nrundll32 %PUBLIC%\\130486.pgj,DF1\n\nKeep in mind these files are from one specific example. Artifacts generated from other spreadsheets\nhave different names and different file extensions. Common characteristics include:\n\nAll three artifacts have the same name, but different file extensions.\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo of the artifacts are ASCII strings with base64 text.\nOne of the artifacts is a DLL for BazarLoader.\nOne of the text-based artifacts uses an .xlsb file extension.\n\nThe DLL is designed to retrieve a BazarLoader EXE. In our example from April 14, 2021, the\nBazarLoader EXE was saved to a folder under the C:\\ProgramData directory as shown below in\nFigure 12.\n\nFigure 12. Windows EXE file for BazarLoader.\n\n## Follow-Up Activities\n\nBazarLoader provides backdoor access to an infected Windows host. In some cases, Cobalt Strike\n[is seen as follow-up malware, leading to other malware like Anchor. At least two cases have been](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.anchor)\npublicly documented where BazarLoader malware led to Cobalt Strike and then to Anchor malware.\n[One case happened in February 2021, and the other case happened in March 2021.](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/03/08/bazar-drops-the-anchor/)\n\nHowever, BazarLoader is not limited to just Cobalt Strike and Anchor as follow-up malware. 2020\nsaw reports of [BazarLoader leading to ransomware like Ryuk. Backdoor access to an infected](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ryuk-2020-distributing-ransomware-via-trickbot-and-bazarloader)\nWindows host could lead to any family of malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs early as February 2021, we have seen several reports of the BazarCall method distributing\nBazarLoader malware using call center personnel. These infections follow noticeable patterns, and\nthey can lead to other malware like Cobalt Strike, Anchor and Ryuk ransomware.\n\nOrganizations with decent spam filtering, proper system administration and up-to-date Windows\nhosts have a much lower risk of infection from BazarLoader malware and its post-infection activity.\n[Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are further protected from this threat with a](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\n[Threat Prevention security subscription.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention)\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise\ndescribed in this report, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.
