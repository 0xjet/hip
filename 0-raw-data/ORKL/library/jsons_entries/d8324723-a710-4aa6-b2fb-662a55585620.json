The backdoor BS2005 - which has traditionally been used by the group\n\n- now appears alongside the additional backdoors RoyalCli and RoyalDNS.\n\nThe RoyalCli backdoor appears to be an evolution of BS2005 and uses familiar encryption and\nencoding routines. The name RoyalCli was chosen by us due to a debugging path left in the\nbinary:\n\nc:\\users\\wizard\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\Projects\\RoyalCli\\Release\\RoyalCli.pdb\n\nRoyalCli and BS2005 both communicate with the attacker's command and control (C2) through\nInternet Explorer (IE) by using the COM interface IWebBrowser2. Due to the nature of the\ntechnique, this results in C2 data being cached to disk by the IE process; we'll get to this later.\n\nAnalysis of the domains and IP address infrastructure used by APT15 identified a number of\nsimilar possible domains, shown at the bottom of the post. These appeared to be hosted on\neither Linode or Google Cloud, with a preference for using the ASN AS63949.\n\nAll of the backdoors identified - excluding RoyalDNS - required APT15 to create batch scripts\nin order to install its persistence mechanism. This was achieved through the use of a simple\nWindows run key. We believe that APT15 could have employed this technique in order to\nevade behavioural detection, rather than due to a lack of sophistication or development\ncapability.\n\nAdditional tools were recovered during the incident, including a network scanning/enumeration\ntool, the archiving tool WinRAR and a bespoke Microsoft SharePoint enumeration and data\n\n\n-----\n\nnames for data extraction. The tool would connect to the SQL SharePoint database and issue\na query to dump all data from the database to a temporary file affixed with 'spdata'. The group\nalso used keyloggers and their own .NET tool to enumerate folders and dump data from\nMicrosoft Exchange mailboxes.\n\nAPT15 was also observed using Mimikatz to dump credentials and generate Kerberos golden\ntickets. This allowed the group to persist in the victim's network in the event of remediation\nactions being undertaken, such as a password reset.\n\n## APT15 lives off the land\n\nUpon ejection from the network, APT15 managed to regain access a couple of weeks later via\nthe corporate VPN solution with a stolen VPN certificate, which they had extracted from a\ncompromised host.\n\nThis time, APT15 opted for a DNS based backdoor: RoyalDNS. The persistence mechanism\nused by RoyalDNS was achieved through a service called 'Nwsapagent'.\n\nC2 of this backdoor was performed using the TXT record of the DNS protocol. C2 was\ncommunicating with the domain 'andspurs[.]com'.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that due to the nature of the IE injection technique used by the HTTPbased backdoors, a number of C2 commands were cached to disk. We were able to recover\nthese files and reverse engineer the encoding routine used by the backdoors in order to\nuncover the exact commands executed by the attacker.\n\nIn total, we were able to recover more than 200 commands executed by the attacker against\nthe compromised hosts and were able to gain a clear insight into the attacker's TTPs. Our\n[decode scripts can be found on our Github page: https://github.com/nccgroup/Royal_APT](https://github.com/nccgroup/Royal_APT)\n\nAnalysis of the commands executed by APT15 reaffirmed the group's preference to 'live off\nthe land'. They utilised Windows commands in order to enumerate and conduct\nreconnaissance activities such as tasklist.exe, ping.exe, netstat.exe, net.exe, systeminfo.exe,\nipconfig.exe and bcp.exe.\n\nLateral movement was conducted through by a combination of net command, mounting the C$\nshare of hosts and manually copying files to or from compromised hosts. APT15 then used a\ntool known as RemoteExec (similar to Microsoft's Psexec) in order to remotely execute batch\nscripts and binaries.\n\nDuring our analysis of the decoded attacker commands we noticed a typographical mistake,\nshown below in the folder name 'systme'. This indicates that a human operative was executing\ncommands on a command line style interface, rather than an automated or GUI process.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCs\n\nBelow are a number of hashes relating to the backdoors identified in use by APT15\n\nRoyal DNS: bc937f6e958b339f6925023bc2af375d669084e9551fd3753e501ef26e36b39d>\nBS2005: 750d9eecd533f89b8aa13aeab173a1cf813b021b6824bc30e60f5db6fa7b950b\n\nBS2005: 6ea9cc475d41ca07fa206eb84b10cf2bbd2392366890de5ae67241afa2f4269f\n\nRoyalCli: 6df9b712ff56009810c4000a0ad47e41b7a6183b69416251e060b5c80cd05785\nMS Exchange Tool: 16b868d1bef6be39f69b4e976595e7bd46b6c0595cf6bc482229dbb9e64f1bce\n\nNCC Group & Fox-IT have created a number of Suricata IDS rules to detect APT15 activity\nthrough the use of these backdoors. These, along with YARA signatures for the backdoors\nidentified, can be found in the Github repository linked above.\n\n## Domains\n\nThe RoyalCli backdoor was attempting to communicate to the following domains:\n\nNews.memozilla[.]org\nvideo.memozilla[.]org\n\nThe BS2005 backdoor utilised the following domains for C2:\n\nRun.linodepower[.]com\nSinga.linodepower[.]com\nlog.autocount[.]org\n\nRoyalDNS backdoor was seen communicating to the domain:\n\nandspurs[.]com\n\nPossible linked APT15 domains include:\n\nMicakiz.wikaba[.]org\ncavanic9[.]net\nridingduck[.]com\nzipcodeterm[.]com\ndnsapp[.]info\n\n**Published date:&nbsp 10 March 2018**\n\n\n-----",
