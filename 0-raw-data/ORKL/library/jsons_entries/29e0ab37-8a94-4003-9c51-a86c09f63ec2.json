To disguise the malicious process, it uses a known Linux process\nname (bioset).\nIn addition, for defense evasion, the malware hides malicious processes using library\ninjection and encrypts the malicious payload inside a binary to make the automated\nstatic analysis more difficult.\n\n### Recent attacks\n\nIn the last month, the group was using a detection evasion tool named\n[libprocesshider, copied from open source repositories.](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/teamtnt-delivers-malware-with-new-detection-evasion-tool)\n\n\n-----\n\nTeamTNT hackers had used malicious shell scripts to exfiltrate Docker API logins,\n[along with AWS credentials, and deployed cryptocurrency miners.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/a/malicious-shell-script-steals-cloud-credentials.html)\n[In another research, Palo Alto researchers found an Ezuri loader in the group’s](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labs-research/malware-using-new-ezuri-memory-loader)\nrecently developed arsenal.\nIn December, the TeamTNT group was deploying a distributed denial of service\n[(DDoS) capable IRC bot called TNTbotinger.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/teamtnt-now-deploying-ddos-capable-irc-bot-tntbotinger.html)\n\n### Wrapping up\n\nTeamTNT has been continuously expanding its capabilities and arsenal with new tools and\nmalware. Targeting a Kubernetes cluster can be more profitable than a hijacked Docker\nhost. With more sophisticated tactics for initial intrusion, execution, defense evasion, and\ncommand and control, the threat actor can be expected to launch a larger-scale attack in\nthe near future.\n\nTeamTNT Palo Alto Hildegard Malware Cryptojacking Cryptojacking Attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nPublisher\n\n## Cyware\n\n\n-----",
