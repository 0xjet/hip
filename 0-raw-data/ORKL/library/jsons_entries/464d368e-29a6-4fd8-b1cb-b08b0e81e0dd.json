In November 2015,\nClearSky and Minerva Labs published[1] the first public report exposing its activity. In March 2017, ClearSky\npublished a second report[2] exposing further incidents, some of which impacted the German Bundestag. In this\nreport, Trend Micro and ClearSky expose a vast espionage apparatus spanning the entire time the group has\nbeen active. It includes recent incidents as well as older ones that have not been publicly reported; new\nmalware; exploitation, delivery and command and control infrastructure; and the group's modus operandi.\nWe dubbed this activity Operation Wilted Tulip\n\n##### Targetting\nCopyKittens is an active cyber espionage actor whose primary focus appears to be foreign espionage on\nstrategic targets. Its main targets are in countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, The United States,\nJordan, and Germany. Occasionally individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees.\nTargeted organizations include government institutions (such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs), academic\ninstitutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large\nIT companies. Online news outlets and general websites were breached and weaponized as a vehicle for\nwatering hole attacks.\n\nFor example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, trying to infect multiple targets in other government\norganizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign\naffairs was used as decoy. In other cases, Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in\nIsrael.\n\nVictims are targeted by watering hole attacks, and emails with links to malicious websites or with malicious\nattachments. Fake Facebook profiles have been used for spreading malicious links and building trust with\ntargets. Some of the profiles have been active for years.\n\n##### Malware\nCopyKittens use several self-developed malware and hacking tools that have not been publicly reported to\ndate, and are analyzed in this report: TDTESS backdoor; Vminst, a lateral movement tool; NetSrv, a Cobalt\nStrike loader; and **ZPP, a files compression console program. The group also uses** **Matryoshka v1, a self-**\ndeveloped RAT analyzed by ClearSky in the 2015 report, and Matryoshka v2 which is a new version, albeit with\nsimilar functionality.\n\nThe group often uses the trial version of Cobalt Strike[3], a publicly available commercial software for \"Adversary\nSimulations and Red Team Operations.\" Other public tools used by the group are Metasploit, a well-known\nfree and open source framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine;\nMimikatz, a post-exploitation tool that performs credential dumping; and Empire, \"a PowerShell and Python\npost-exploitation agent.\" For detection and exploitation of internet-facing web servers, CopyKittens use Havij,\nAcunetix and sqlmap.\n\nA notable characteristic of CopyKittens is the use of DNS for command and control communication (C&C) and\nfor data exfiltration. This feature is available both in Cobalt Strike and in Matryoshka.\n\nMost of the infrastructure used by the group is in the U.S., Russia, and The Netherlands. Some of it has been\nin use for more than two years.\n\n[1](http://www.clearskysec.com/report-the-copykittens-are-targeting-israelis/) [www.clearskysec.com/report-the-copykittens-are-targeting-israelis/](http://www.clearskysec.com/report-the-copykittens-are-targeting-israelis/)\n[2](http://www.clearskysec.com/copykitten-jpost/) [www.clearskysec.com/copykitten-jpost/](http://www.clearskysec.com/copykitten-jpost/)\n3 [https://www.cobaltstrike.com](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)\n\nPage 3 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n### Targeting\n\n\nBased on Trend Micro Telemetry, incident response engagements, and open source threat intelligence\ninvestigations, we have learned of CopyKittens target organizations and countries. Its main targets are in\ncountries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, The United States, Jordan, and Germany. Occasionally\nindividuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees.\n\nTargeted organizations include government institutions (such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs), academic\ninstitutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large\nIT companies. Online news outlets and general websites were breached and weaponized as a vehicle for\nwatering hole attacks.\n\nFor example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, trying to infect multiple targets in other government\norganizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign\naffairs was used as decoy. In other cases, Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in\nIsrael.\n\nBased on the size of the attack infrastructure and length of the campaign, we estimate that there have been\nat least a few hundred people infected in multiple organizations in the targeted countries.\n\nAfter infecting a computer within a target organization, the attacker would move latterly using one of the\nmalware descried in chapter \"Malware.\" It seems that their objective is to gather as much information and\ndata from target organizations as possible. They would indiscriminately exfiltrate large amounts of documents,\nspreadsheets, file containing personal data, configuration files and databases.\n\nIn at least one case, the attackers breached an IT company, and used VPN access it had to client organizations\nto breach their networks.\n\nOften, victim organizations would learn of the breach due to the non-stealthy behavior of the attackers. The\nattackers would \"get greedy,\" infecting multiple computers within the network of breached organizations. This\nwould raise an alarm in various defense systems, making the victims initiate incident response operations.\n\nPage 4 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n### Delivery and Infection \n\n\nCopyKittens attack their targets using the following methods:\n\n  - **Watering hole attacks – inserting malicious JavaScript code into breached strategic websites.**\n\n  - **Web based exploitation – emailing links to websites built by the attackers and containing known**\nexploits.\n\n  - **Malicious documents – email attachments containing weaponized Microsoft Office documents.**\n\n  - **Fake social media entities – fake personal and organizational Facebook pages are used for interaction**\nwith targets and for information gathering.\n\n  - **Web hacking – Havij, Acuntix and sqlmap are used to detect and exploit internet-facing web servers.**\n\nThese methods are elaborated below.\n\n#### Watering Hole Attacks\n\nOn 30 March 2017, ClearSky reported a breach of multiple websites, such as Jerusalem Post, Maariv news and\nthe IDF Disabled Veterans Organization website.[4] JavaScript code was inserted into the breached websites,\nloading BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) from domains owned by the attackers .[5] For example:\n\n_Malicious code added to Maariv website_\n\nThe malicious code was loaded from one of the following addresses:\n\n_https://js.jguery[.]net/jquery.min.js_\n_https://js.jguery[.]online/jgueryui.min.js_\n\nThis would enable the attackers to perform actions such as browser fingerprinting and information gathering,\nsocial engineering attacks (like asking for credentials, redirect to another page, asking the user to install a\nmalicious extension or malware), network reconnaissance, infecting the computer using Metasploit exploits,\nand more.[6] The malicious code was served only when specific targets visited the website, likely based on IP\nwhitelisting.\n\nNotably, prior to that publication, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) said in a statement\nthat it had investigated \"problems in network traffic\" of the German Bundestag.[7] The statement concluded\nthat the website of Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post was manipulated and linked to a harmful third party in\nJanuary 2017.\n\n[4](http://www.clearskysec.com/copykitten-jpost/) [www.clearskysec.com/copykitten-jpost](http://www.clearskysec.com/copykitten-jpost/)\n[5](http://beefproject.com/) [http://beefproject.com](http://beefproject.com/)\n[6](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki) [https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki)\n[7](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2017/Cyber-Angriff_auf_den_Bundestag_Stellungnahme_29032017.html) [https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2017/Cyber-](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2017/Cyber-Angriff_auf_den_Bundestag_Stellungnahme_29032017.html)\n[Angriff_auf_den_Bundestag_Stellungnahme_29032017.html](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2017/Cyber-Angriff_auf_den_Bundestag_Stellungnahme_29032017.html)\n\nPage 5 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Web-Based Exploitation \n\nIn two incidents, the attackers breached the mailbox of a person related to a target organization. From this\n(real) account, they replied to previous correspondences with these organizations, adding a malicious link to\na website registered and built by attackers: primeminister-goverment-techcenter].[tech. [8]\n\nJavaScript code, at least parts of which were copied from public sources, fingerprinted the visitor's web\nbrowser.[9] This was likely used for later browser exploitation with known vulnerabilities.\n\nIn some pages the code enumerates and collects a list of installed browser plugins, in others it tries to detect\nthe real IP of the computer:\n\n_Browser Plugins enumeration via JavaScipt code_\n\n_Internal IP detection with Java_\n\nThe data is sent to the attackers, and the victim is redirected to https://akamitechnology[.]com/.\n\n_Collected data sent to server, then redirecting to new domain_\n\n[8](https://blog.domaintools.com/2017/03/hunt-case-study-hunting-campaign-indicators-on-privacy-protected-attack-infrastructure/) [https://blog.domaintools.com/2017/03/hunt-case-study-hunting-campaign-indicators-on-privacy-protected-attack-](https://blog.domaintools.com/2017/03/hunt-case-study-hunting-campaign-indicators-on-privacy-protected-attack-infrastructure/)\n[infrastructure](https://blog.domaintools.com/2017/03/hunt-case-study-hunting-campaign-indicators-on-privacy-protected-attack-infrastructure/)\n[9](https://gist.github.com/kou1okada/2356972) [https://gist.github.com/kou1okada/2356972](https://gist.github.com/kou1okada/2356972)\n\nPage 6 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n_JavaScript and Java code loaded into webpage, victim is redirected after 20 seconds_\n\n#### Malicious Documents\n\nThe attackers use three document based exploitation types: exploiting CVE-2017-0199, embedding OLE\nobjects, and macros. If the victim opens a document and the exploitation is successful (in the latter two, user\ninteraction might be required), the attackers would receive access to the computer via self-developed or\npublicly available malware (see \"Malware\" chapter for more details).\n\n##### Exploiting CVE-2017-0199\n\nOn 26 April 2017, a malicious email was sent from an employee account that was likely breached within the\nMinistry of Northern Cyprus. It was sent to a disclosed recipients list in government institutions in several\ncountries and other organizations, mostly in or related to ministries of foreign affairs. We should note,\nhowever, that it is possible that the attackers were interested only in a few of the recipient organizations, but\nsent it to a wider list because they showed up in previous correspondences in the breached account.\n\nRecipients were in the following domains:\n\n\nmofa.gov.vn\nmfa.gov.sg\nmfa.gov.tr\npost.mfa.uz\nmfa.am\nmfa.gov.by\nbeijing.mfa.gov.il\nmofat.go.kr\nmfa.no\nmofa.go.jp\n\n\nathens.mfa.gov.il\nriga.mfa.sk\namfam.com\nemfa.pt\nmfa.gov.il\nmfa.gov.mk\nbu.edu\nus.mufg.jp\ncyburguide.com\nnewdelhi.mfa.gov.il\n\n\nhemofarm.co.yu\nmfat.govt.nz\nmfa.gr\nmfa.gov.lv\nmfa.gov.ua\nmfa.go.th\nmfa.gov.bn\nmfa.ee\nsbcglobal.net\nmfa.is\n\n\nPage 7 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email is presented below:\n\n\n_Redacted version of the malicious email sent form the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern_\n\n_Cyprus_\n\nAttached to it was a document named \"IRAN_NORTH-KOREA_Russia 20170420.docx\".[11]\n\n_Content of the malicious document_\n\nThe document exploited CVE-2017-0199, downloading an rtf file from:\n\n_update.microsoft-office[.]solutions/license.doc_\n\nThe rtf file loads a VBA script from:\n\n_http://38.130.75[.]20/check.html_\n\n10 [https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/521687de405b2616b1bb690519e993a9fb714cecd488c168a146ff4bbf719f87/analysis/](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/521687de405b2616b1bb690519e993a9fb714cecd488c168a146ff4bbf719f87/analysis/)\n11 [https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/026e9e1cb1a9c2bc0631726cacdb208e704235666042543e766fbd4555bd6950/analysis](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/026e9e1cb1a9c2bc0631726cacdb208e704235666042543e766fbd4555bd6950/analysis)\n\nPage 8 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nWhich runs a Cobalt Strike stager that communicates with:\n\n_aaa.stage.14043411.email.sharepoint-microsoft[.]co_\n\nIn another case, the following document was uploaded to VirusTotal from Israel:[12]\n\n\"The North Korean weapons program now testing USA range.docx\"\n\n_Content of the malicious document and a prompt that opens when external links are updated_\n\nIt downloads an rtf document from:\n\n_http://update.microsoft-office[.]solutions/license.doc_\n\nThis downloads VBA code that runs a Cobalt Strike stager from the following addresses:\n\n_http://38.130.75[.]20/error.html_\n\nPivoting from update.microsoft-office[.]solutions, we found diagnose.microsoft-office[.]solutions, which\npointed to 5.34.181.13.

Backdoor\n\nTDTESS (22fd59c534b9b8f5cd69e967cc51de098627b582) is 64-bit .NET binary backdoor that provides a\nreverse shell with an option to download and execute files. It routinely calls in to the command and control\nserver for new instructions using basic authentication. Commands are sent via a web page. The malware\ncreates a stealth service, which will not show on the service manager or other tools that enumerate services\nfrom WINAPI or Windows Management Instrumentation.\n\n##### Installation and removal\n\nTDTESS can run as either an interactive or non-interactive (service) program. When called interactively, it\nreceives one of the two arguments: installtheservice to install itself or uninstalltheservice to remove itself. The\narguments are described below:\n\n**installtheservice**\n\nIf running with administrator privileges, it will install a service with the following characteristics:\n\n**_Key name: bmwappushservice_**\n**_Display name: bmwappushsvc_**\n**_Description: WAP Push Message Routing Service_**\n**_Type: own (runs in its own process)_**\n**_Start type: auto (starts each time the computer is restarted and runs even if no one logs on to the_**\n_computer)_\n**_Path: <main executable path> (In our analysis: c:\\Users\\PC008\\Desktop\\t.exe)_**\n**_Security descriptor:_**\n_D:(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;IU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;SU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLC_\n_SWLOCRRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)S:(AU;F_\n_A;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;WD)_\n\n_Service information from command-line using sc tool_\n\nThe hardcoded security descriptor used to create the service is a persistence technique. Interactive users, even\nif they are administrators, cannot stop or even see the service in services.msc snap-in.\n\nPage 27 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing is a list of denied commands:\n\n_service_change_config_\n_service_query_status_\n_service_stop_\n_service_pause_continue_\n_delete_\n\n_Service information in Registry_\n\nTwo log files are created during the service installation, but deleted by the program. Following is their\nrecovered content:\n\n_InstallUtil.InstallLog_\n\n_<filename>.t.InstallLog_\n\nAfter creating the service, it will update the file creation time to that of the following file:\n\n_%windir%\\system32\\svchost.exe_\n\nPage 28 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n**uninstalltheservice**\n\nIf running with administrator privileges, it will uninstall the said service, create log files and then deletes them.\n\n_InstallUtil.InstallLog_\n\n_<filename>.t.InstallLog_\n\nBecause the service installing mechanism appears to be default for .NET programs, the creator of the tool\ndeletes the log files right after they are created.\n\nIf no argument is given when called interactively, the program terminates itself.\n\n##### Functionality\n\nThe service is started immediately after installation. After five minutes, it verifies internet connectivity by\nmaking a HTTP HEAD request to microsoft.com.\n\nThen it tries to access the C&C servers looking for commands.\n\n_Hardcoded HTTP parameters and URL_\n\nPage 29 of 48\n©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a reply, TDTESS expects one of the following Bas64 encoded commands:\n\n**_getnrun - download and execute a file.

It Injects Cobalt Strike into memory of infected hosts.\n\nThe binary implements ServiceMain and is intended to be installed as a service named “sdrsrv.” When it\nfunctions as a service, it injects Cobalt Strike beacon into its own process (which is 32-bit “svchost”) or creates\na new 32-bit “rundll32” process and injects the beacon into the new process. The injection method depends\non the parameter received when the service was created.\n\nIt is configured to open a new “rundll32” process in suspend-mode and create a remote thread which executes\na Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode.\n\nThe binary has the option to run and load itself in memory. It also has the option to be executed through its\nexported function \"v,\" which gets a base64 string parameter built as follows:\n\n_Base-64-Encode(“/mv /OptionalCommand”)_\n\n_OptionalCommand can be one of the following:_\n\n  - **help - prints usage instructions:**\n\n_[*] /help V160\\n_\n_Get : Create Service and run beacon over self thread\\n_\n\n_[*] /get ip (use current token)\\n_\n\n_[*] /get ip domain user pass\\n_\n\n_[*] /get ip user pass\\n_\n_New : Create Service and run beacon over new rundll32.exe thread\\n_\n\n_[*] /new ip (use current token)\\n_\n\n_[*] /new ip domain user pass\\n_\n\n_[*] /new ip user pass\\n_\n\n_[*] /new ip user pass\\n_\n_Del : Delete service and related dlls from remote host_\n\n_[*] /del ip domain user pass\\n_\n\n_[*] /del ip user pass\\n_\n\n_[*] /del ip\\n_\n_Run : Run a new beacon !\\n_\n\n_[*] /run [no arguments]_\n\n  - **del - stops and deletes the service “sdrsrv,” and deletes the following files:**\n\n_\\\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\\C$\\Users\\public\\vminst.tmp_\n_\\\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\\C$\\Windows\\Temp\\vminst.tmp_\n_\\\\ [IP or computer name (Can be Localhost)]\\C$\\Windows\\vminst.tmp_\n\n  - **scan - sends “]ok[” to the parent of its parent process.**\n\n  - **info - sends “]ok[” to the parent of its parent process.**\n\n  - **run - injects a beacon into a new “rundll32” process.**\n\n  - **get - gets an IP address, installs and starts the “sdrsrv” service in the remote hosts.**\n\n  - **new - gets IP address, deletes the old vminst from install path, and installs the “sdrsrv” service in the**\nremote hosts.
