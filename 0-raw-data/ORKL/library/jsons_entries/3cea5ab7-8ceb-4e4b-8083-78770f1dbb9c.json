low; or that they quit and formed BlackMatter.\n\n • Disappearance likely due to the high-profile ransomware attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure, and the resulting discussions between the highest levels of the U.S. and Russian governments.\n\n • Russian hacker forums have banned them and other ransomware operators from advertising, but this is not expected to seriously impede them.\n\n • Due to the unwillingness of Russian law enforcement to cooperate with their U.S. counterparts, it is unlikely that there were or will be any legal penalties issued to REvil members in the near future.\n\n • However they are organized in the future:\n    o The individuals involved in REvil will most likely continue as ransomware operators.\n    o The relationships REvil had with other cyber criminals will most likely be preserved.\n    o The technology that REvil developed will continue to be utilized and built upon.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Reference Materials\n\n\n-----\n\n###### •
