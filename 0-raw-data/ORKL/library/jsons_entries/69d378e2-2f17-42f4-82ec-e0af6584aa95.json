They use simple techniques to infect\nvictims and aim to raise money through large numbers of relatively small ransoms of perhaps\na few hundred dollars each.\n\nSamSam is very different – it’s used in targeted attacks by a skilled team or individual who\nbreaks into a victim’s network, surveils it and then runs the malware manually. The attacks\nare tailored to cause maximum damage and ransom demands are measured in the tens of\n\n\n-----\n\nthousands of dollars.\n\nBecause the malware has been used so sparingly compared to other types of ransomware,\ndetails about how it works and how the attacks play out have been elusive since its first\nappearance in December 2015.\n\nAlthough you are unlikely to be the target of a SamSam ransomware attack – attacks occur\nat a rate of about one per day – those who are can find the effects devastating.\n\n## New insights\n\nThe research paper reveals a host of fresh technical insights including new details about how\nSamSam scans victims’ networks and builds up the list of machines it’s going to encrypt.\n\nPerhaps most eye-catching though is new information about how it spreads: Unlike\nWannaCry, which exploited a software vulnerability to copy itself to new machines, SamSam\nis actually deployed to computers on the victim’s network in the same way, and with the\nsame tools, as legitimate software applications.\n\nSophos’s investigation also sheds new light on the number of attacks, how often they occur\nand who has been targeted.\n\nBased on the known victims, it’s been widely speculated until now that SamSam attacks are\ndirected specifically at the healthcare, government and education sectors. Sophos can reveal\nthat this is not the case.\n\n[Working with cryptocurrency monitoring organisation Neutrino, Sophos followed the money](https://www.neutrino.nu/)\nand identified many ransom payments and victims that were previously unknown. Based on\nthe much larger number of victims now known it seems that far from being unaffected, the\nprivate sector has actually borne the brunt of SamSam. Victims in that sector have simply\nbeen far more reluctant to come forward.\n\nThe money trail also revealed that SamSam has netted nearly $6 million in ransom\npayments – about six times more than the most recent best estimate.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom its new research, Sophos is also able to offer better protection and disaster recovery\nadvice too. Thanks to an improved understanding of the way that SamSam targets files in\nthe victim’s operating system, Sophos now recommends that backing up your business data\nis not enough. To recover swiftly from a SamSam attack, organisations need more than a\nplan for restoring data – they need a comprehensive plan for rebuilding machines.\n\n## How attacks unfold\n\nThe SamSam attacker gains access to victims’ networks via RDP (Remote Desktop\nProtocol) by using software like nlbrute to successfully guess weak passwords.\n\nSophos has identified that the timing of attacks changes to reflect the victim’s timezone.\nWhether the victim is on the west coast of the USA or in the UK, attacks happen at night time\nwhile the the victims are asleep.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Unlike other well-known ransomware such as WannaCry or NotPetya, SamSam doesn t](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/05/17/wannacry-the-ransomware-worm-that-didnt-arrive-on-a-phishing-hook/)\nhave any worm-like or virus capabilities, so it can’t spread by itself. Instead, it relies on the\nhuman attacker to spread it – an attacker who can adapt their tactics according to the\nenvironment and defences they discover as they surveil the target.\n\nBy working in this way, the attacker can try over and over again to work around defences and\ngain the access they want. If the SamSam attacker is on your network they will likely stay on\nit until they succeed, unless they’re kicked off.\n\nHaving gained access to a network, the SamSam operator uses a variety of tools to escalate\ntheir privileges to the level of Domain Admin. Then they scan the network for valuable targets\nand deploy and execute the malware as any self-respecting sysadmin might, using utilities\nsuch as PsExec or PaExec.\n\nOnce it has been spread far and wide, the many copies of the ransomware are triggered\ncentrally, starting within seconds of each other. On each infected machine, files are\nencrypted in a way that’s designed to cause the most damage in the shortest time.\n\nOnce the attack has been launched, the attacker waits to see if the victim makes contact via\na Dark Web payment site referenced in the ransom note.\n\nRansom demands have increased over time to about $50,000, vastly more than the three\nfigure sums typical of untargeted ransomware attacks.\n\n## What to do?\n\nTo avoid becoming a victim, the best defence against SamSam or any other form of malware\nis to adopt a layered, defence in depth approach to security.\n\nSamSam targets appear to be chosen on the basis of their vulnerability. Earlier attacks\nestablished a foothold on victims’ networks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities.\nMore recently the attacks have begun with the brute forcing of RDP credentials.\n\nStaying on top of your patching and maintaining good password discipline will therefore\nprovide a formidable barrier to SamSam attacks. That barrier can then be strengthened\nsignificantly with these simple steps:\n\n1. Restrict RDP access to staff connecting over a VPN.\n2. Use multi-factor authentication for VPN access and sensitive internal systems.\n3. Complete regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.\n4. Keep backups offline and offsite.\n\nOf course SamSam is just one of millions of cyberthreats and this detailed examination of\nSamSam is just part of the constant, [ongoing malware research undertaken by Sophos to](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/category/sophoslabs/sophoslabs-uncut/?cmp=26061)\n[improve and adapt its ability to protect against all forms of malware.](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/intercept-x.aspx?cmp=26061)\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can read more about the history of SamSam, how it works and how to protect against it\nin Sophos’s extensive new research paper, **SamSam: The (Almost) Six Million Dollar**\n**Ransomware.**\n\nThe investigation is ongoing – if you have information about SamSam or you are a security\nvendor interested in collaborating with our investigation, please contact Sophos.\n\n\n-----",
