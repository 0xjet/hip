    "plain_text": "# Malwarebytes targeted by Nation State Actor implicated in SolarWinds breach. Evidence suggests abuse of privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments\n\n**blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2021/01/malwarebytes-targeted-by-nation-state-actor-implicated-in-**\nsolarwinds-breach-evidence-suggests-abuse-of-privileged-access-to-microsoft-office-365-and-azure-environments/\n\nMarcin Kleczynski January 19, 2021\n\nA nation state attack leveraging software from SolarWinds has caused a ripple effect\nthroughout the security industry, impacting multiple organizations. We first reported on the\nevent in our [December 14 blog and notified our business customers using SolarWinds](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/12/advanced-cyber-attack-hits-private-and-public-sector-via-supply-chain-software-update/)\nasking them to take precautionary measures.\n\nWhile Malwarebytes does not use SolarWinds, we, like many other companies were recently\ntargeted by the same threat actor. We can confirm the existence of another intrusion vector\nthat works by abusing applications with privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure\nenvironments. After an extensive investigation, we determined the attacker only gained\naccess to a limited subset of internal company emails. We found no evidence of\nunauthorized access or compromise in any of our internal on-premises and production\nenvironments.\n\n**How did this impact Malwarebytes?**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe received information from the Microsoft Security Response Center on December 15\nabout suspicious activity from a third-party application in our Microsoft Office 365 tenant\nconsistent with the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of the same advanced threat\nactor involved in the SolarWinds attacks.\n\nWe immediately activated our incident response group and engaged Microsoft’s Detection\nand Response Team (DART). Together, we performed an extensive investigation of both our\ncloud and on-premises environments for any activity related to the API calls that triggered\nthe initial alert. The investigation indicates the attackers leveraged a dormant email\nprotection product within our Office 365 tenant that allowed access to a limited subset of\ninternal company emails. We do not use Azure cloud services in our production\nenvironments.\n\nConsidering the supply chain nature of the SolarWinds attack, and in an abundance of\ncaution, we immediately performed a thorough investigation of all Malwarebytes source\ncode, build and delivery processes, including reverse engineering our own software. Our\ninternal systems showed no evidence of unauthorized access or compromise in any onpremises and production environments. Our software remains safe to use.\n\n**What we know: SolarWinds Attackers Also Target Administrative and Service**\n**Credentials**\n\n[As the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) stated, the adversary did](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\nnot only rely on the SolarWinds supply-chain attack but indeed used additional means to\ncompromise high-value targets by exploiting administrative or service credentials.\n\n[In 2019, a security researcher exposed a flaw with Azure Active Directory where one could](https://www.troopers.de/troopers19/agenda/y3nswp/)\nescalate privileges by assigning credentials to applications. In September 2019, he found\nthat the [vulnerability still existed and essentially lead to backdoor access to principals’](https://dirkjanm.io/azure-ad-privilege-escalation-application-admin/)\ncredentials into Microsoft Graph and Azure AD Graph.\n\nThird-party applications can be abused if an attacker with sufficient administrative privilege\n[gains access to a tenant. A newly released CISA report reveals how threat actors may have](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-008a)\nobtained initial access by password guessing or password spraying in addition to exploiting\nadministrative or service credentials. In our particular instance, the threat actor added a selfsigned certificate with credentials to the service principal account. From there, they can\nauthenticate using the key and make API calls to request emails via MSGraph.\n\nFor many organizations, securing Azure tenants may be a challenging task, especially when\ndealing with third-party applications or resellers. CrowdStrike, which was also targeted but in\n[an unsuccessful attempt, has released a tool to help companies identify and mitigate risks in](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-launches-free-tool-to-identify-and-help-mitigate-risks-in-azure-active-directory/)\nAzure Active Directory.\n\n**Coming together as an industry**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile we have learned a lot of information in a relatively short period of time, there is much\nmore yet to be discovered about this long and active campaign that has impacted so many\nhigh-profile targets. It is imperative that security companies continue to share information\nthat can help the greater industry in times like these, particularly with such new and complex\nattacks often associated with nation state actors.\n\nWe would like to thank the security community, particularly FireEye and Microsoft for sharing\nso many details regarding this attack. In an already difficult year, security practitioners and\nincident responders responded to the call of duty and worked throughout the holiday season,\nincluding our own dedicated employees. The security industry is full of exceptional people\nwho are tirelessly defending others, and today it is strikingly evident just how essential our\nwork is moving forward.\n\n_Update: Clarified statement about “Azure Active Directory weakness”._\n_Update 2: Clarified that the attack on CrowdStrike was not successful_\n\n\n-----",
