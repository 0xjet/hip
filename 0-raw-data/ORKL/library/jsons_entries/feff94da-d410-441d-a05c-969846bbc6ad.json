The group was reportedly [using spear-phishing emails with weaponized attachments to exploit known vulnerabilities. Primarily motivated](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf)\nby information theft and espionage, the group has also been seen adopting different strategies such as fine-tuning tools with [new behaviors and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tropic-trooper-new-strategy/) [going mobile with](https://blog.lookout.com/titan-mobile-threat)\nsurveillanceware.\n\nWe found that Tropic Trooper’s latest activities center on targeting Taiwanese and the Philippine military’s physically isolated networks through a USBferry attack\n(the name derived from a sample found in a related research). We also observed targets among military/navy agencies, government institutions, military hospitals, and\neven a national bank. The group employs USBferry, a USB malware that performs different commands on specific targets, maintains stealth in environments, and\nsteals critical data through USB storage. We started tracking this particular campaign in 2018, and our analysis shows that it uses a fake executable decoy and a USB\ntrojan strategy to steal information.\n\nBased on data from the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ security infrastructure, USBferry attacks have been active since 2014. We found the group was\nfocused on stealing defense-, ocean-, and ship-related documents from target networks, which led us to believe that Tropic Trooper’s main purpose is to exfiltrate\nconfidential information or intelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\nTropic Trooper is well aware that military or government organizations may have more robust security in their physically isolated environments (i.e., the use of\nbiometrics or USB use in a quarantined machine before an air-gapped environment). The group then targets potentially unsecured related organizations that could\nserve as jumping-off points for attacks. For instance, we observed Tropic Trooper move from a military hospital to the military’s physically isolated network.\n\nThis blog post provides an overview of the USB malware called USBferry and its capabilities, as well as the other tools used to infiltrate physically isolated\nenvironments. Further details, including indicators of compromise (IoCs), can be read in the **[technical brief.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-Tropic-Trooper-s-Back-USBferry-Attack-Targets-Air-gapped-Environments.pdf)**\n\n### A USB malware called USBferry\n\nWe first encountered the malware from a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that [mentioned a sample related to Tropic Trooper but did not include a detailed analysis.](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/research/the-keyboys-are-back-in-town.html)\nWe looked into it further and discovered many versions of it, including several program database (PDB) strings. For one thing, the USBferry malware already has at\nleast three versions, with different variants and components, at the time of writing. Here are the noteworthy points we gathered during analysis:\n\nThe first version has a small component of [TROJ_YAHOYAH. The malware tries to check if the target machine has a USB plug-in and copies the USBferry](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf)\ninstaller into the USB storage. The activities vary in target environments; some execute commands, source target files or folder lists, and copy files from\nphysically isolated hosts to compromised hosts, among other things.\n\n_Figure 2. USBferry malware’s first version, where the EXE file is the USBferry malware and the DLL file is trojan TROJ_YAHOYAH_\n\nThe second version has the same capabilities as the first and combines components into one executable. This version also changes the malware location and its\nname to UF, an abbreviation for USBferry.\n\n_Figure 3. USBferry malware’s second version combined into one file_\n\nThe third version retains the previous versions’ capabilities and improves its stealth in the target environment by residing in the rundll32.exe memory.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. USBferry malware’s third version becomes resident in memory_\n\n### How USBferry targets air-gapped systems\n\n[In our technical brief, we broke down how Tropic Trooper has changed the way it uses the abovementioned USBferry versions in attacks. The group achieves](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-Tropic-Trooper-s-Back-USBferry-Attack-Targets-Air-gapped-Environments.pdf)\ninfection by employing the USB worm infection strategy and ferrying a malware installer via USB into an air-gapped host machine.\n\n_Figure 5. USBferry malware using USB worm infection strategy_\n\nHere we will discuss the notable changes in the group’s latest attack chain that uses version UF1.0 20160226 (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_USBLODR.ZAHBA):\n\n_Figure 6. USBferry attack scenario, version UF1.0 20160226_\n\n1. The decoy file first drops a flash_en.inf DLL file, which is a USBferry loader, and tries to load the encrypted USBferry malware\n2. The encrypted USBferry malware is embedded in the loader resource section, and the loader drops it into the C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Flash folder and\n\nnames it flash.dat\n3. After the encrypted payload is loaded, the loader injects a malicious DLL into rundll32.exe. The USBferry malware also loads a C&C configuration file and\n\n_flash_en.dat, which is also located in the C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Flash_\n4. The USBferry malware then tries to connect to the download site and uses a Windows command to collect/copy target host data\n\nThis version checks for network connectivity; if it finds that the network is unavailable, it tries to collect information from the target machine and copy the collected\ndata into USB storage. This way, the USB exfiltrates the information and sends it back to the C&C server.\n\n### Backdoors and other tools used by Tropic Trooper\n\nSome backdoors used by Tropic Trooper use injection to execute its routines, while others execute directly and run itself consistently. The group also uses\nsteganography to mask their backdoor routines and evade anti-malware and network perimeter detection. To find the full list of the backdoors we analyzed, check out\n[our technical brief.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-Tropic-Trooper-s-Back-USBferry-Attack-Targets-Air-gapped-Environments.pdf)\n\nHere we will tackle some of the noteworthy backdoors Tropic Trooper used.\n\n**WelCome To Svchost 3.2 20110818’s backdoor (detected as BKDR_SVCSHELL.ZAHC-A) – This backdoor bears similarities with a payload we** [discussed](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf)\nin our previous research. Based on the malware version number, this backdoor’s first version was developed in or before 2011. This means that Tropic\nTrooper’s activities have been ongoing for at least ten years now.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. The backdoor version name, registered service name, and malware components’ filenames_\n\n**Welcome To IDShell 1.0 20150310’s backdoor (detected as BKDR_IDSHELL.ZTFC-A) – The purpose of this backdoor, which has two types, including a**\nsteganography jpg version, is to recon the target machine. Like other versions, it uses the DNS protocol to communicate with the backdoor controller. The\ntraffic is encrypted to evade detection.\n\n_Figure 8. The backdoor’s communication traffic_\n\n**Hey! Welcome Server 2.0’s backdoor (detected as BKDR_TEBSHELL.ZTGK) – This is the latest version of the backdoor, available in 32-bit and 64-bit**\nversions, which uses an invisible web shell for remote control and network security evasion. It runs the process as a service, hides backdoor communication in\nnormal traffic, and uses customized TCP protocol. It also improves the way it handles wrong input commands and unauthorized access.\n\n_Figure 9. The executable version will install and name it as a Windows service, change registry to disable error display, and launch the service_\n\nTropic Trooper also used other tools in their attacks, such as:\n\nCommand-line remote control listener/port relay tool, which has different versions that can communicate with the backdoor.\nBackdoor payload/steganography payload execution loaders, which have two versions that can be used to successfully load the encrypted payload and\nsubsequently delete itself and the payload.\nPort scanning tools, which are available on the internet.\n\nThe overview provided above highlights how putting critical information in physically isolated networks is not a bulletproof solution for defending against\ncyberespionage. Steganography isn’t just used to deliver encrypted payloads; it can also be used to transfer information to a C&C server. Multiple hacking tools and\ncomponents can also help facilitate successful attacks on different networks and environments. Threat actors like Tropic Trooper can also use an invisible web shell\nto hide its C&C server location and make incident response tricky.\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK Matrix**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Best practices and Trend Micro solutions\n\nThe latest developments with Tropic Trooper indicate that they are well-prepared to target government institutions and military agencies for stolen intelligence. The\ngroup also takes a long time to perform reconnaissance and consequently infiltrate physically isolated networks. This research also underscores how threat actors\ncould see potentially vulnerable targets as launch points for extending their attack attempts to other, more critical targets.\n\nUnderstanding attack tactics and techniques can provide the needed context for assessing potential impact and adopting defensive strategies. Here are some measures\nthat organizations can practice to thwart advanced persistent threats with security that employs actionable threat intelligence, network-wide visibility, and timely\nthreat protection:\n\n**Enforce the principle of least privilege.
