A new world confrontation is\nhighly unlikely at this moment but the weapons used are as high-tech as it gets as some of\nthem use code instead of gunpowder.\n\nAs the first Russian troops started rolling into Ukraine, cybersecurity experts everywhere\nbraced for the worst -- some of the biggest cybercrime gangs in the world are known to\nhave close ties with the Russian government and operate from so-called “hacker heavens”\nin the ex-Soviet space.\n\nThe fears came to life when the Conti ransomware group publicly pledged its support to the\nRussian cause. Several Ukrainian banks and public institutions were hit by DDoS attacks\nand data-erasing malware, but, retaliatory attacks against western public institutions and\ncompanies have remained scarce. For now.\n\n\n-----\n\nIs this a sign that most organizations have correctly assessed the danger and strengthened\ntheir security, or is it just the calm before the storm?\n\nHere’s what we know so far:\n\n### 1.   For now, Ukraine is the main target\n\nMost of the cyberattacks so far have focused strictly on hitting Ukrainian organizations, in at\nleast three separate waves:\n\non Jan. 14, 70 government websites were defaced and taken offline, including the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and the Security and Defense Council. However, according\nto the reports no data was leaked, and downtime lasted a few hours. Almost at the\n[same time, the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) reported active malware,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)\ndubbed WhisperGate, that was made to look like ransomware but lacked a recovery\ncomponent. This meant it was actually designed to destroy data.\non Feb. 15, Ukraine's two largest banks were taken offline by a massive Distributed\nDenial of Service (DDoS) attack that also affected mobile apps and ATMs.\n\n\n-----\n\non Feb. 23, another DDoS attack took out military and government sites while a data\nwiper called HermeticWiper was detected on hundreds of computers belonging to\nvarious Ukrainian organizations. Simultaneously, MSTIC detected a trojan dubbed\nFoxBlade that can surreptitiously weaponize victims’ computers and use them in\nDDoS attacks.\n\nDespite the obvious interest in disrupting the Ukrainian infrastructure there’s no guarantee\nmalware like WhisperGate, HermeticWiper or FoxBlade can’t spill over to computers in\nother countries too. Additionally, as more countries join the sanctions against Russia,\nRussian-backed hackers could shift their focus and retaliate.\n\n### 2.   Ukraine is fighting back\n\nKremlin-backed hackers may have had the benefit of surprise, but the cyberwar isn’t onesided at all. On the contrary, after the initial shock, the Ukrainian government called for the\nassembly of a volunteer IT army that quickly started retaliating: the hacker collective\nAnonymous took down the Belarussian Railways internal network and almost 300 company\n[websites in Russia. Conti’s internal messages and source code were leaked, the Kremlin](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/ukrainian-researcher-leaks-conti-ransomware-source-code/)\nsite was hacked, the Russian Nuclear Institute and the Russian Space agency suffered\ndata breaches and Russian tv channels were hacked to show real footage from Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3.   It’s not just about companies\n\nThere’s a general belief state actors only go after companies and public institutions, but\nthat’s not the case. Sometimes they also target regular people. In late February, the national\nComputer Emergency Response Team for Ukraine issued a warning of a major phishing\ncampaign against military personnel. Even more worrying, European officials were targeted\nwith malware in an apparent attempt to disrupt efforts to help Ukrainian refugees.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhether they’re looking to gather intelligence, phish for credentials or obstruct humanitarian\nefforts, state actors don’t discriminate when it comes to targeting regular people. Even if\nyou’re not directly involved in the current situation, it’s always a good idea to protect your\ndevices from malware, update them regularly, use strong passwords and watch out for\nscams and phishing emails.\n\n### 4.   There are third parties taking advantage of the situation\n\n[Researchers at Bitdefender Labs picked up waves of fraudulent and malicious emails](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/bitdefender-labs-sees-increased-malicious-and-scam-activity-exploiting-the-war-in-ukraine/)\nexploiting the humanitarian crisis and charitable spirit of people across the globe. The\nconflict in Ukraine is a gold mine for scammers and criminal groups that aren’t necessarily\npolitically involved but love making money. One of the preferred methods is using fraudulent\n\n\n-----\n\nemails asking recipients to donate money. Scammers are impersonating the Ukrainian\ngovernment, international humanitarian agency Act for Peace, UNICEF, and the Ukraine\nCrisis Relief Fund to ask for crypto donations.\n\n### 5.   Cyberwar could be the next cold war\n\nThe lack of devastating attacks on western targets on the scale of Colonial Pipeline or\nKaseya doesn’t mean the danger has passed. Even if the military conflict ends, the cyber\nconflict is likely to persist for years, and all parties involved, whether government agencies,\nprivate companies, or regular users, must come to terms with it.\n\nWhether we like it or not, cyberattacks used for sabotage or spying aren’t going away\nanytime soon for a number of reasons: they’re cheap and efficient, they can be launched\nfrom anywhere in the world, they bring in good money, state responsibility is hard to prove\nand, most importantly, the number of potential targets is virtually unlimited.\n\n\n-----\n\n**For more tips, please check our dedicated cybersecurity** **[guide in armed conflict](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/cybersecurity-tips-in-armed-conflict-areas-heres-how-bitdefender-is-helping/)**\n**zones.**\n\nIn response to the military crisis and increased cybercriminal activity, Bitdefender & the\nRomanian National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) are offering **free cybersecurity**\n**protection for any Ukrainian citizen, company or institution, as long as necessary.**\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[ukraine](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/tag/ukraine/) [industry news](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/tag/industry-news/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Radu CRAHMALIUC\n\nRadu is a tech-geek with 15 years of experience in writing, journalism and copywriting.\nWhen he’s not writing he’s probably taking something apart, trying to figure out how things\nwork.\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/author/radu-crahmaliuc/)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
