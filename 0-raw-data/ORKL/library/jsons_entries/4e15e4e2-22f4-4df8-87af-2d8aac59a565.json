What we’ve seen so far:\n\n## Malspam campaigns deliver Agent Tesla and Remcos RATs\n\nSince March 1, Bitdefender Labs have been tracking two phishing campaigns attempting to\ninfect recipients with two well-known remote access Trojans – Agent Tesla and Remcos.\n\n**Campaign 1:**\n\nThe first malspam campaign appears to be targeting organizations in the manufacturing\nindustry via a .zip attachment ‘REQ Supplier Survey’. The attackers ask recipients to fill out\na survey concerning their backup plans in response to the war in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to our threat researchers, the malicious payload is downloaded and deployed\nfrom a Discord link directly on the victim’s machine. Interestingly though, interacting with the\nmalicious file will also download a clean version of Chrome on the users’ device – most\nlikely an attempt at diverting users.\n\n\n-----\n\nAgent Tesla is an infamous Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) RAT and data stealer that has\nbeen prevalent in numerous email-based cyberattacks during the health crisis. Perpetrators\nuse Agent Tesla to exfiltrate sensitive information including credentials, keystrokes and\nclipboard data from their targets.\n\nAccording to our analysis, the attacks seemingly originated from IP addresses in the\nNetherlands (86%) and Hungary (3%). The malicious emails have reached recipients\nworldwide including South Korea (23%), Germany (10%), the UK (10%), the US (8%), the\nCzech Republic (14%), Ireland (5%), Hungary (3%), Sweden (3%) and Australia (2%).\n\nBitdefender customers are already protected against Agent Tesla attacks. The attached file\n_REQ Supplier Survey.zip, detected as Gen:NN.ZemsilCO.34232.cm0@aKLKBXo, is_\ndetected and blocked by both our consumer and enterprise solutions.\n\n**Campaign 2:**\n\n\n-----\n\nOur researchers spotted a separate malspam campaign on March 2, where attackers\nimpersonate a South Korean-based healthcare company that specializes in in-vitro\ndiagnostics analyzers to deliver the Remcos RAT via an Excel attachment\n(SUCT220002.xlsx).\n\nThe message cites the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and asks recipients if they want to put\none of their orders on hold until shipments and flights reopen. Cyber attackers mainly\ndeploy Remcos RAT via malicious documents or archives to gain full control over their\nvictims’ systems. Once inside, they can capture keystrokes, screenshots, credentials, or\nother sensitive system information and exfiltrate it directly to their servers.\n\nEighty-nine percent of the malicious emails appear to originate from IP addresses in\nGermany and 19% from the US. The attackers’ focus in on recipients in Ireland (32%), India\n(17%), the US (7%), the UK (4%), Germany (4%), Vietnam (4%), Russia (2%), South Africa\n(2%) and Australia (2%).\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the recent cyberattacks were not specifically aimed at Ukrainian infrastructure or\ncivilian population, the global tension generated by the ongoing war will likely materialize in\nmore targeted attacks that could deter emergency response services and humanitarian aid\nefforts in the country,\" said Alexandru Maximciuc, threat researcher at Bitdefender Labs.\n\n\"We've already seen mass DDoS attacks and wiper malware that hit financial institutions\nand organizations in Ukraine. Considering the extended economic sanctions imposed by\nwestern nations in response to the Russian invasion, digital aggressions aimed at disrupting\ncritical infrastructures should not be dismissed in the current threat landscape.”\n\nBitdefender consumer and business solutions detect the malicious attachment\n_SUCT220002.xlsx delivering the Remcos RAT as Exploit.CVE-2017-11882.Gen._\n\n## Charity crypto scams are intensifying\n\nOn Feb 25, Bitdefender Antispam Lab reported the first signs of scammers exploiting the\nRussian invasion of Ukraine and news of Ukrainian citizens fleeing the country. As\nexpected, fraudsters continue to leverage the ongoing humanitarian crisis for their own\nfinancial gains.\n\nWithin hours after the invasion, the Ukrainian government announced it accepts BTC and\nETH cryptocurrency donations, and the global community did not disappoint. According to\nthe latest analysis of blockchain transactions, the ETH wallet received over 18,524\ntransactions totaling over $9.7 million, while the BTC wallet shows more than 9,300\ntransactions with a value of $9.4 million.\n\nThere’s no doubt about it; individuals, organizations, and governments are picking sides,\nand cybercriminals have to intensify their efforts to redirect any financial aid into their\npockets.\n\n_“Major global events and crises are known to trigger malicious spam campaigns that exploit_\n_human emotion and people's desire to help,” said Adrian Miron, Antispam Research_\n_Manager at Bitdefender._\n\n_“So far, we've noticed that the attackers reacted very quickly to legitimate announcements_\n_of Ukraine and other organizations by mimicking the format of their messages. We expect_\n_the variety of phishing and malware campaigns, as well as the volume of messages sent_\n_daily, to increase steadily, and the attackers to adapt their persuasion methods accordingly.”_\n\nBitdefender Labs is actively monitoring fraudulent donation emails luring recipients to\ndonate money. Scammers are impersonating the Ukrainian government, international\nhumanitarian agency Act for Peace, UNICEF, and other donation projects such as the\n**Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund to deliver their pleas for financial assistance to help the**\nUkrainian army and millions of civilians and children caught in the military conflict\n\n\n-----\n\nSubject lines are as follows:\n\nStand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin,\nEthereum and USDT.\nHELP UKRAINE stop the war!\nUkraine Humanitarian Donation\nDonate to Ukraine, Help save a life: Please read\nUrgent! Help Children in Ukraine\nSubject: Help Ukraine\n\nThe emails play on users’ emotions citing the impact on communities in Ukraine and the\ngrowing number of refugees that are fleeing the country and in great need of supplies and\nhousing.\n\nEmail-based charity scams peaked on March 2, according to Bitdefender Antispam Lab.\n\nOne particular campaign, using the subject line “Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now\naccepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT” originating from IP\naddresses in China has reached tens of thousands of inboxes on March 2nd. Twenty-five\npercent of the scam emails were directed to users in the UK, 14% in the US, 10% in South\nKorea, 8% in Japan, 7% in Germany, 4% in Romania, and 2% each in Greece, Finland and\nItaly.\n\nAdditional crypto charity scam samples can be seen below:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Nigerian Prince-style email schemes\n\nBitdefender spam filters have also noticed a Ukraine variation of the Nigerian Prince scam.\nThe email, allegedly sent by a renowned businessman from Ukraine seeks your assistance\nto transfer $10 million until he is able to relocate somewhere safe.\n\nFraudsters behind this particular scam are sending emails from IP addresses in Botswana\n(83%), Germany (10%) and France 5%. Their main audience are users in Germany (42%),\nTurkey (16%), the US (16%), Ireland (8%) and Poland (3%).\n\nUnfortunately, users who respond to this email will get in touch with the scammer who will\nask for personal information to help transfer the money out of the country. Although the\nemail does not promise recipients any financial awards for their help, the con artist will likely\nspecify remuneration for helping him finalize the transfer. Most often the scammer will ask\n\n\n-----\n\nrecipients to pay administration fees, often associated with moving large sums. Upon\ndeceiving the victim, the scammer will either disappear with the money or, worse, drain their\nbank account in the process.\n\nSample 7\n**Bitdefender’s focus on cybersafety**\n\nThe fact that cybercriminals and scammers are using the crisis in Ukraine to steal users’\nmoney and spread malicious payloads comes as no surprise to cybersecurity experts.\nAlthough the war in Ukraine may be thousands of miles away from many of us, people’s\nsuffering triggers a strong emotional response to users worldwide who wish to lend a hand\nto refugees fleeing the war-struck European country.\n\nWe urge all internet users to be extra vigilant during these troubled times and practice good\ncyber hygiene to ensure that their hard-earned money does not end up in the wrong hands:\n\nNever click on links or attachments in emails or messages that ask you to donate\nurgently\nDonate exclusively via official and trusted charities, non-profit organizations and\nfundraisers\nCheck your financial accounts regularly for any suspicious activity or unauthorized\ncharges\nSet up unique passwords for all online accounts\n\n**For more tips, please check our dedicated cybersecurity** **[guide in armed conflict](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/cybersecurity-tips-in-armed-conflict-areas-heres-how-bitdefender-is-helping/)**\n**zones.**\n\nIn response to the military crisis and increased cybercriminal activity, Bitdefender & the\nRomanian National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) are offering **free cybersecurity**\n**protection for any Ukrainian citizen company or institution as long as necessary**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, users across the globe can also boost their cyber resilience and fend off online\n[scams and e-threats with our extended Bitdefender Total Security trial, free of charge for](https://www.bitdefender.com/media/html/consumer/new/get-your-90-day-trial-opt/index.html?cid=soc%7Cc%7cblog%7C90DaysTrial)\n90-days.
