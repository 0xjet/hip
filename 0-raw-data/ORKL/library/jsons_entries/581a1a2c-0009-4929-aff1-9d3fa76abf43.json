Adding new attack capabilities and more aggressive extortion\ntechniques, the groups are rapidly extending their respective ransomware arsenals in what\nappears to be an escalation of both ransomware attacks and tactics.\n\nOver the past several weeks, Flashpoint has observed increased activity from ransomware\ngroups REvil and CL0P. Adding new attack capabilities and more aggressive extortion\ntechniques, the groups are rapidly extending their respective ransomware arsenals in what\nappears to be an escalation of both ransomware attacks and tactics.\n\n## CL0P Ransomware Hones in on Accellion Breach Victims\n\nMost recently, on March 8, 2021, CL0P began to extort the data of a new victim, Flagstar\nBank, to its ransomware blog. Included in this post were samples of presumed Flagstar Bank\ncustomer and employee information—including names, partial SSNs, and physical and email\naddresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nCL0P signaled that the email addresses and other personally identifiable information (PII) it\nposted were for sale and that they would entertain offers to purchase and obtain the data\ndirectly or pay for its deletion from the CL0P site.\n\n### Following CL0P Doxxing, Flagstar Bank Announces Unlinked Data Breach\n\nLater on that day, Flagstar Bank [issued a statement on its website detailing the likely](https://www.flagstar.com/customer-support/accellion-information-center.html)\nconnected and exploited vulnerability the bank uncovered due to its use of third-party vendor\nAccellion and its file-sharing platform; Flagstar also disclosed that some of its data had been\nexposed as part of this incident. The extent of Accellion’s breach continues to unfold with this\n[news, already blamed for other major breaches like Jones Day law firm.](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/jones-day-ransomware-attack-third-party-accellion-blamed/)\n\n## CL0P’s Multi-Pronged Extortion Ransomware to Catch On Fast\n\nAlthough it’s common practice for extortionist ransomware groups to exfiltrate large swaths of\ndata prior to deploying its encryption malware, the primary objective has, historically, been to\nprove to ransomware victims the extent of the group’s successful compromise. In these\nhistorical cases, the data is taken in a “snatch and grab” manner, without consideration given\nto the stolen data’s value or type. Similarly, there’s little to no forethought given to the\nselection of the sample data that the ransomware group chooses to post to its blog.\n\nInterestingly, in this recent case with Flagstar Bank, there was no apparent or acknowledged\nIT environment lockdown, and thus no ransomware attack occurred by definition. However,\ngiven the sensitive and valuable nature of the Flagstar data that CL0P posted to its blog, it’s\nclear that CL0P was at least moderately successful in its attack. By repurposing the\nexfiltrated data to conduct different non-ransomware extortion tactics on the same victim,\nCL0P extended the data’s fungibility and furthered its monetization goals.\n\nFlashpoint expects that other ransomware groups will be quick to adopt CL0P’s multipronged extortion ransomware strategy, given the relatively minor uplift it requires to\nrepurpose the already-stolen data.\n\n## REvil Adds DDoS and Phoning to Ransomware Arsenal\n\nOn February 25, 2021, the REvil spokesperson operating under the alias “Unknown” on the\ntop-tier Russian-language cybercrime forums XSS and Exploit announced that the\nransomware group was actively looking to add new partners to its organization to provide\nEnglish-language negotiations, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and access to\n“tier 1” networks with revenue greater than $1 billion USD.\n\nTwo weeks later, on March 4, 2021, the REvil spokesperson announced another round of\nnew capabilities, this time aimed at improving their affiliates’ abilities to pressure victims into\npaying the ransom. These new capabilities included L3 and L7 DDoS attacks in “test mode”\n\n\n-----\n\nand the ability to make anonymized phone calls to victims business associates and the\nmedia.\n\nSpecifically, the REvil spokesperson announced the following on XSS [translated from\nRussian]:\n\n_“We now have the opportunity to check your networks (calls to the media, counter_\n_agents of companies) to exert maximum pressure. In order to do this, you have to_\n_indicate the domain of the company in the description of the network, who does it_\n_communicate with, and so on. You can also add contacts for spam and checking_\n_(phone numbers) to the chat.”_\n\n### REvil Keeps Pace with Competitor Collectives\n\nWhile these ransomware extortion tactics are new for REvil, other competitor ransomware\ncollectives have long offered these capabilities. For instance, the ransomware groups\nAvaddon and Suncrypt currently use DDoS techniques as part of their ransomware TTPs.\nAnd the [now-defunct Maze ransomware group and several others are known to use cold](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/ransomware-retrospective-analyzing-1100-attacks-from-2020/)\ncalling techniques to ratchet up extortion pressure on their victims.\n\n## Try Flashpoint’s Expanded Ransomware Libraries and Response Services\n\nWith [Flashpoint Ransomware Readiness and Response, we prepare enterprise customers](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/threat-response-and-readiness/)\nworldwide to face ransomware attacks and actively support them as live incidents unfold.\n\n**[Sign up for a risk-free 90-day trial and see Flashpoint Intelligence in action—including our](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/free-trial)**\nrecently expanded ransomware threat libraries with more data and new ways to explore and\nanalyze targeted threats. Equipped with Flashpoint, you’ll leap ahead of ransomware attacks\nand the cybercriminal groups who execute them.\n\n\n-----",
