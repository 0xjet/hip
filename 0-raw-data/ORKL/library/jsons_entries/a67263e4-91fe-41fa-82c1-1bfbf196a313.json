    "plain_text": "# Quarterly Report: Incident Response trends from Fall 2020\n\n**[blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/12/quarterly-ir-report-fall-2020-q4.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/12/quarterly-ir-report-fall-2020-q4.html)**\n\n_By_ _[David Liebenberg and](https://twitter.com/chinahanddave?lang=en)_ _[Caitlin Huey.](https://twitter.com/hueylittle_er)_\n\nFor the sixth quarter in a row, Cisco Talos Incident Response (CTIR) observed ransomware\ndominating the threat landscape. However, for the first quarter since we began compiling\nthese reports, no engagements that were closed out involved the ransomware Ryuk (though\nthere were engagements that were kicked off this quarter involving Ryuk, but have yet to\nclose). The top ransomware families observed were Maze and Sodinokibi, though barely\nmore than any others, continuing a trend of “democratization” for ransomware families\n[observed in last quarter’s report, in which no one family was dominant. With Maze](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/CTIR-quarterly-trends-Q4-2020.html)\nadversaries’ recent announcement of retirement, the possibility remains that more\nransomware groups will step up to fill the void, accelerating this trend.\n\nBesides the drop in Ryuk, we saw a continuing decline in commodity trojans such as Trickbot\nand Emotet, as ransomware adversaries rely more on open-source tools, the Cobalt Strike\nframework, and a combination of various living-off-the-land tools and utilities, or “LoLBins.\"\n\n[The lack of Ryuk is somewhat surprising given recent reports from the U.S. government that](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a)\nindicate adversaries are looking to target health care organizations with Ryuk. Part of this\ncould be related to the timing of these incidents, which occurred toward the end of Q3 2020.\nWe do note that there were several Ryuk cases opened toward the end of the quarter which\nhave yet to close, including one affecting a health care company. CTIR also observed a\ngeneral increase in engagements involving attacks against health care organizations toward\n\n\n-----\n\nthe end of the quarter, though they mostly involved other malware families, such as the Vatet\nloader, which is known to target this industry. For more information, you can check out the full\n[report summary here.](https://talosintelligence.com/resources/150)\n\n## Targeting\n\nActors targeted a broad range of verticals, including agriculture, food and beverage, health\ncare, education, energy and utilities, industrial distribution, law enforcement, local\ngovernment, manufacturing, and technology. The top targeted vertical was manufacturing, a\ncontinuation of last quarter. However, as mentioned above, there was a spike in attacks\nagainst health care organizations, and some of these engagements have yet to close out. In\ncounting both engagements that were opened and closed out this quarter, health care and\nmanufacturing sectors were tied as being the most affected sectors this quarter. Looking\nahead, it appears that adversaries will continue to target the health care industry with\nransomware and other types of attacks given their security postures and incentives to pay,\nespecially given the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, which threat actors have been\nmore than willing to capitalize on.\n\n## Threats\n\nRansomware continued to comprise the majority of threats CTIR observed. In a continuation\nfrom last quarter, no one ransomware family was dominant. Furthermore, there were no\nengagements that closed out involving Ryuk (though there was one engagement which\nopened this quarter in which Ryuk is suspected). In the past, Ryuk was much more\nprominent. In a continuation from the last several quarters, the majority of ransomware\nattacks were not observed in conjunction with commodity trojan infections, instead relying on\nopen source tools, Cobalt Strike, and living-off-the-land utilities.\n\nFor example, a U.S. manufacturing company was targeted with a phishing email that\ncontained a malicious ZIP file. Once downloaded and opened, an adversary carried out\nmultiple malicious actions, including connection to a malicious IP address, account\nenumeration, and execution of encoded PowerShell. The adversary attempted to deploy a\nmalicious ransomware file called “hnt.dll,” which CTIR identified as a Maze ransomware\nvariant, although the mutexes were slightly different from previous Maze mutexes which\ncould have indicated a new strain. The customer had Cisco AMP for Endpoints running\nwhich successfully quarantined the malicious DLL. The adversary used several commercially\navailable and open source tools for malicious means, including PowerShell to execute\nencoded commands; Cobalt Strike, including executing \"Invoke-DACheck\", an Aggressor\nscript that checks to see if the current user is a domain administrator and \"Norton Power\nEraser \" a scanning tool that irreversibly removes forensic artifacts vital to the investigation\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom systems. CTIR investigated possible indicators of data exfiltration from six hosts to a\nmalicious C2 IP address, including large amounts of packets exchanged over the observed\ntime period. However, they found no evidence of data staging or any specific indicators that\ndata was exfiltrated from the environment.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that the Maze ransomware group announced they have officially\nclosed down their ransomware operation and claimed they will no longer be leaking new\ncompany data on their site. While the validity of Maze’s claim is still unknown at this time, it is\npossible that lower-tiered ransomware groups may attempt to compete within this threat\nlandscape now that a very high-profile group has announced its departure.\n\nCTIR has observed a spike in Vatet loader/ransomware engagements this quarter affecting\nhealth care entities. Vatet is known to be used by adversary groups to specifically target\nhealth care organizations. In one open incident response engagement involving a U.S.\nmedical center infected with Vatet, CTIR identified the likely infection vector as an IcedID\nphishing email with a ZIP attachment that used steganography for loading commands to the\nVatet loader itself. From there, IcedID downloaded and ran Vatet, which started Cobalt Strike\nactivity and eventually launched and executed the Defray777 ransomware.\n\nOther observed threats this quarter included business email compromise (BEC),\ncryptocurrency mining, web shells, brute-force attacks, exploit attempts and information\nstealers.\n\n## Initial vectors\n\nFor the majority of engagements, definitively identifying an initial vector was difficult due to\nshortfalls in logging. However, in engagements in which the initial vector could be identified,\nor reasonably assumed, phishing remained the top infection vector for the sixth quarter in a\nrow. Besides email, other initial vectors that CTIR has observed this quarter include drive-by\ndownloads, RDP brute-force attacks, and exploitation of various vulnerabilities, including\nMicrosoft Exchange (CVE-2020-0688), SaltStack Salt (CVE-2020-116511 and CVE-202011652), and Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2020-14882).\n\n## Top-observed MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\nBelow is a list of the most common MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed in this quarter’s IR\nengagements. Given that some techniques can fall under multiple categories, we grouped\nthem under the most relevant category in which they were leveraged. This represents what\nCTIR observed most frequently and is not intended to be exhaustive.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\nThe usage of Cobalt Strike decreased by half. However, we do note that there are\nmany open engagements that rely on Cobalt Strike for post-exploitation.\nWe observed a robust combination of various living-off-the-land tools and utilities, or\n“LoLBins.” This is a continuation of a trend seen in late 2019 where actors combine\nfileless malware and legitimate cloud services to improve chances of staying\nundetected.\nEncoded PowerShell commands account for several execution techniques, illustrating\nthe need for policies to limit unprivileged users from using PowerShell or CMD\napplications.\nLeveraging valid accounts is the most observed technique used for lateral movement\nthis quarter. RDP usage for lateral movement decreased this quarter. However, we did\nsee brute-force attacks almost double this quarter.\n\n**ATT&CK techniques**\n\n**Initial Access (TA0027), T1078 Valid Accounts: Use valid compromised credentials**\nin BEC scam.\n**Persistence (TA0028), T1543 Create or Modify System Process: Install a**\ncryptomining application service on the system to maintain persistence on the server.\n**Execution (TA0041), T1059.001 Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell:**\nExecutes PowerShell code to retrieve information about the client's Active Directory\nenvironment.\n**Discovery (TA0007), T1082 System Information Discovery: Used Process Hacker to**\nidentify infected machine’s OS information.\n**Credential Access (TA0006), T1003 OS Credential Dumping: Use tools such as**\nMimikatz to compromise credentials in the environment.\n**Privilege Escalation (TA0029), T1484 Group Policy Modification: Force group**\npolicy update that creates service to execute ransomware.\n**Lateral Movement (TA0008), T1021.001 Remote Desktop Protocol: Adversary**\nconnects to the system using RDP with valid credentials.\n**Collection (TA0035), T1560.001 Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility: One**\nbinary was capable of extracting system information and files that are subsequently\nplaced within a tar archive, which is compressed with bzip2.\n**Defense Evasion (TA0030), T1070 Indicator Removal on Host: Remove files and**\nartifacts from an infected machine.\n**Command and control (TA0011), T1132.001 Data Encoding: Standard Encoding:**\nUse Base64 to encode C2 communication.\n**Exfiltration (TA0010), T1567 Exfiltration Over Web Service: Data exfiltration was**\nperformed with the usage of FirefoxSend.\n**Impact (TA0034), T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact: Deploy Maze ransomware**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Software, Cobalt Strike: Execution of Invoke-DACheck, a Cobalt Strike Aggressor**\nScript to check if the current user is a domain administrator.\n\n\n-----",
