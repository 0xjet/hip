These cyber actors, including advanced\npersistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains,\neconomic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage\nphysical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical\nconsequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National\nCritical Functions.\nOT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available,\noften incorporate vulnerable information technology\n(IT) components, and include external connections\nand remote access that increase their attack\nsurfaces. In addition, a multitude of tools are readily\navailable to exploit IT and OT systems. As a result of\nthese factors, malicious cyber actors present an\nincreasing risk to ICS networks.\n\nTraditional\napproaches to\nsecuring OT/ICS do\nnot adequately\naddress current\nthreats.\n\nTraditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats to\nthose systems. However, owners and operators who understand cyber actors’ tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) can use that knowledge when prioritizing hardening\nactions for OT/ICS.\nThis joint Cybersecurity Advisory, which builds on previous NSA and CISA guidance to\nstop malicious ICS activity and reduce OT exposure [1] [2], describes TTPs that\nmalicious actors use to compromise OT/ICS assets. It also recommends mitigations that\nowners and operators can use to defend their systems. NSA and CISA encourage\nOT/ICS owners and operators to apply the recommendations in this CSA.\n\nThis document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited.

Traditional ICS assets are difficult to secure due to their design for\nmaximum availability and safety, coupled with their use of decades-old systems that\noften lack any recent security updates. Newer ICS assets may be able to be configured\nmore securely, but often have an increased attack surface due to incorporating Internet\nor IT network connectivity to facilitate remote control and operations. The net effect of\nthe convergence of IT and OT platforms has increased the risk of cyber exploitation of\ncontrol systems. [3]\nToday’s cyber realm is filled with well-funded malicious cyber actors financed by nationstates, as well as less sophisticated groups, independent hackers, and insider threats.\nControl systems have been targeted by a variety of these malicious cyber actors in\nrecent years to achieve political gains, economic advantages, and possibly destructive\neffects. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] More recently, APT actors have also developed tools for\nscanning, compromising, and controlling targeted OT devices. [9]\n\nMalicious actors’ game plan for control system intrusions\nCyber actors typically follow these steps to plan and execute compromises against\ncritical infrastructure control systems:\n1. Establish intended effect and select a target.\n2. Collect intelligence about the target system.\n3. Develop techniques and tools to navigate and manipulate the system.\n4. Gain initial access to the system.\n5. Execute techniques and tools to create the intended effect.\nLeveraging specific expertise and network knowledge, malicious actors—especially\nstate-sponsored ones—can conduct these steps in a coordinated manner, sometimes\nconcurrently and repeatedly, as illustrated by real world cyber activity. [5] [10]\n\nEstablish intended effect and select a target\nCyber actors, from cyber criminals to state-sponsored APT actors, target critical\ninfrastructure to achieve a variety of objectives. Cyber criminals are financially\nmotivated and target OT/ICS assets for financial gain (e.g., data extortion or\nransomware operations). State-sponsored APT actors target critical infrastructure for\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n2\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\npolitical and/or military objectives, such as destabilizing political or economic\nlandscapes or causing psychological or social impacts on a population. The cyber actor\nselects the target and intended effect—to disrupt, disable, deny, deceive, and/or\ndestroy—based on these objectives. For example, disabling power grids in strategic\nlocations could destabilize economic landscapes or support broader military campaigns.\nDisrupting water treatment facilities or threatening to destroy a dam could have\npsychological or social impacts on a population. [11] [12]\n\nCollect intelligence about the target system\nOnce the intent and target are established, the actor collects intelligence on\nthe targeted control system. The actor may collect data from multiple sources, including:\n\n\nOpen-source research: A great deal of information about control systems and\ntheir designs is publicly available. For example, solicitation information and\nemployment advertisements may indicate components, and list specific model\nnumbers.\n\n\n\nInsider threats: The actor may also leverage trusted insiders, even unwitting\nones, for collecting information. Social engineering often elicits a wealth of\ninformation from people looking for a new job or even just trying to help.\n\n\n\nEnterprise networks: The actor may compromise enterprise IT networks and\ncollect and exfiltrate ICS-related information. Procurement documents,\nengineering specifications, and even configurations may be stored on corporate\nIT networks.\n\nIn addition to OT-specific intelligence, information about IT technologies used in control\nsystems is widely available. Knowledge that was once limited to control system\nengineers and OT operators has become easily available as IT technologies move into\nmore of the control system environment. Control system vendors, in conjunction with\nthe owner/operator community, have continually optimized and reduced the cost of\nengineering, operating, and maintaining control systems by incorporating more\ncommodity IT components and technologies in some parts of OT environments. These\nadvancements can make more information about some systems easily available,\nthereby increasing the risk of cyber exploitation.\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n3\n\nNational\nSecurity\nAgency\n\nCybersecurity and\nInfrastructure\nSecurity Agency\n\n| Cybersecurity Advisory\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nDevelop techniques and tools\nUsing the intelligence collected about the control system’s design, a cyber\nactor may procure systems that are similar to the target and configure them as mock-up\nversions for practice purposes. Nation-state actors can easily obtain most control\nsystem equipment. Groups with limited means can still often acquire control systems\nthrough willing vendors and secondhand resellers.\nAccess to a mock-up of the target system enables an actor to determine the most\neffective tools and techniques. A cyber actor can leverage resident system utilities,\navailable exploitation tools, or, if necessary, develop or purchase custom tools to affect\nthe control system. Utilities that are already on the system can be used to reconfigure\nsettings and may have powerful troubleshooting capabilities.\nAs the control system community has incorporated\ncommodity IT and modernized OT, the community\nhas simplified the tools, techniques, scripts, and\nsoftware packages used in control systems. As a\nresult, a multitude of convenient tools are readily\navailable to exploit IT and OT systems.\n\nA multitude of tools is\nreadily available to\nexploit IT and OT\nsystems.\n\nActors may also develop custom ICS-focused malware based on their knowledge of the\ncontrol systems. For example, TRITON malware was designed to target certain\nversions of Triconex Tricon programmable logic controllers (PLCs) by modifying inmemory firmware to add additional programming. The extra functionality allows an actor\nto read/modify memory contents and execute custom code, disabling the safety system.\n[13] APT actors have also developed tools to scan for, compromise, and control certain\nSchneider Electric PLCs, OMRON Sysmac NEX PLCs, and Open Platform\nCommunications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers. [9]\nWith TTPs in place, a cyber actor is prepared to do virtually anything that a normal\nsystem operator can, and potentially much more.\n\nGain initial access to the system\nTo leverage the techniques and tools that they developed and practiced,\ncyber actors must first gain access to the targeted system. Most modern control\n\nU/OO/## | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n4\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\nsystems maintain remote access capabilities allowing vendors, integrators, service\nproviders, owners, and operators access to the system. Remote access enables these\nparties to perform remote monitoring services, diagnose problems remotely, and verify\nwarranty agreements.\nHowever, these access points often have poor security practices, such as using default\nand maintenance passwords. Malicious cyber actors can leverage these access points\nas vectors to covertly gain access to the system, exfiltrate data, and launch other cyber\nactivities before an operator realizes there is a problem. Malicious actors can use webbased search platforms, such as Shodan, to identify these exposed access points.\nVendor access to control systems typically uses connections that create a bridge\nbetween control system networks and external environments. Often unknown to the\nowner/operator, this bridge provides yet another path for cyber exploitation and allows\ncyber actors to take advantage of vulnerabilities in other infrastructure to gain access to\nthe control system.\nRemote access points and methodologies use a variety of access and communication\nprotocols. Many are nothing more than vendor-provided dial-up modems and network\nswitches protected only by obscurity and passwords. Some are dedicated devices and\nservices that communicate via more secure virtual private networks (VPNs) and\nencryption. Few, if any, offer robust cybersecurity capabilities to protect the control\nsystem access points or prevent the transmission of acquired data outside the relatively\nsecure environment of the isolated control system. This access to an ostensibly closed\ncontrol system can be used to exploit the network and components.\n\nExecute techniques and tools to create the intended effects\nOnce an actor gains initial access to targeted OT/ICS system, the actor will\nexecute techniques, tools, and malware to achieve the intended effects on the target\nsystem. To disrupt, disable, deny, deceive, and/or destroy the system, the malicious\nactor often performs, in any order or in combination, the following activities:\n1. Degrade the operator's ability to monitor the targeted system or degrade the\noperator’s confidence in the control system’s ability to operate, control, and\nmonitor the targeted system. Functionally, an actor could prevent the operator's\ndisplay (human machine interface, or HMI) from being updated and selectively\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n5\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\nupdate or change visualizations on the HMI, as witnessed during the attack on\nthe Ukraine power grid. [5] (Manipulation of View [T0832]1)\n2. Operate the targeted control system. Functionally, this includes the ability to\nmodify analog and digital values internal to the system (changing alarms and\nadding or modifying user accounts), or to change output control points — this\nincludes abilities such as altering tap changer output signals, turbine speed\ndemand, and opening and closing breakers. (Manipulation of Control [T0831])\n3. Impair the system's ability to report data. Functionally, this is accomplished by\ndegrading or disrupting communications with external communications circuits\n(e.g., ICCP2, HDLC3, PLC4, VSAT, SCADA radio, other radio frequency\nmediums), remote terminal units (RTUs) or programmable logic controllers\n(PLCs), connected business or corporate networks, HMI subnetworks, other\nremote I/O, and any connected Historian/bulk data storage. (Block Reporting\nMessage [T0804], Denial of View [T0815])\n4. Deny the operator's ability to control the targeted system. Functionally, this\nincludes the ability to stop, abort, or corrupt the system’s operating system (OS)\nor the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system’s software\nfunctionality. (Denial of Control [T0813])\n5. Enable remote or local reconnaissance on the control system. Functionally, an\nactor could obtain system configuration information to enable development of a\nmodified system configuration or a custom tool. (Collection [TA0100], Theft of\nOperational Information [T0882])\nUsing these techniques, cyber actors could cause various physical consequences. They\ncould open or close breakers, throttle valves, overfill tanks, set turbines to over-speed,\nor place plants in unsafe operating conditions. Additionally, cyber actors could\nmanipulate the control environment, obscuring operator awareness and obstructing\nrecovery, by locking interfaces and setting monitors to show normal conditions. Actors\ncan even suspend alarm functionality, allowing the system to operate under unsafe\nconditions without alerting the operator. Even when physical safety systems should\nprevent catastrophic physical consequences, more limited effects are possible and\n1 T-codes correspond to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n2 ICCP – Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol\n3 HDLC – High-Level Data Link Control Protocol\n4 PLC – Power Line Carrier\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n6\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\ncould be sufficient to meet the actor’s intent. In some scenarios though, if an actor\nsimultaneously manipulates multiple parts of the system, the physical safety systems\nmay not be enough. Impacts to the system could be temporary or permanent, potentially\neven including physical destruction of equipment.\n\nMitigations\nThe complexity of balancing network security with performance, features, ease-of-use,\nand availability can be overwhelming for owner/operators. This is especially true where\nsystem tools and scripts enable ease-of-use and increase availability or functionality of\nthe control network; or when equipment vendors require remote access for warranty\ncompliance, service obligations, and financial/billing functionality. However, with the\nincrease in targeting of OT/ICS by malicious actors, owner/operators should be more\ncognizant of the risks when making these balancing decisions. Owner/operators should\ncarefully consider what information about their systems needs to be publicly available\nand determine if each external connection is truly needed. [1]\nSystem owners and operators cannot prevent a malicious actor from targeting their\nsystems. Understanding that being targeted is not an “if” but a “when” is essential\ncontext for making ICS security decisions. By assuming that the system is being\ntargeted and predicting the effects that a malicious actor would intend to cause,\nowner/operators can prioritize and employ mitigation actions.\nHowever, the variety of available security solutions can also be intimidating, resulting in\nchoice paralysis. In the midst of so many options, owner/operators may be unable to\nincorporate simple security and administrative strategies that could mitigate many of the\ncommon and realistic threats. Fortunately, owner/operators can apply a few\nstraightforward ICS security best practices to counter adversary TTPs.\n\nLimit exposure of system information\nOperational and system information and configuration data is a key element of critical\ninfrastructure operations. The importance of keeping such data confidential cannot be\noverstated. To the extent possible, avoid disclosing information about system hardware,\nfirmware, and software in any public forum. Incorporate information protection education\ninto training for personnel. Limit information that is sent out from the system.\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n7\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\nDocument the answers to the following questions:\n1. From where and to where is data flowing?\n2. How are the communication pathways documented and how is the data\nsecured/encrypted?\n3. How is the data used and secured when it arrives at its destination?\n4. What are the network security standards at the data destination, whether a\nvendor/regulator or administrator/financial institution?\n5. Can the data be shared further once at its destination? Who has the authority to\nshare this data?\nEliminate all other data destinations. Share only the data necessary to comply with\napplicable legal requirements, such as those contractually required by vendors—\nnothing more. Do not allow other uses of the data and other accesses to the system\nwithout strict administrative policies designed specifically to protect the data. Prevent\nnew connections to the control system using strict administrative accountability. Ensure\nstrict agreements are in place with outside systems/vendors when it comes to sharing,\naccess, and use. Have strong policies for the destruction of such data. Audit policies\nand procedures to verify compliance and secure the data once it gets to its destination,\nand determine who actually has access to it.\n\nIdentify and secure remote access points\nOwner/operators must maintain detailed knowledge of all installed systems, including\nwhich remote access points are—or could be—operating in the control system network.\nCreating a full “connectivity inventory” is a critical step in securing access to the system.\nMany vendor-provided devices maintain these access capabilities as an auxiliary\nfunction and may have services that will automatically ‘phone home’ in an attempt to\nregister and update software or firmware. A vendor may also have multiple access\npoints to cover different tasks.\nOnce owner/operators have identified all remote access points on their systems, they\ncan implement the following recommendations to improve their security posture:\n\n\nReduce the attack surface by proactively limiting and hardening Internet-exposed\nassets. See CISA’s Get Your Stuff Off Search page for more information.\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n8\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\n\n\nEstablish a firewall and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the control system\nand the vendor’s access points and devices. Do not allow direct access into the\nsystem; use an intermediary service to share only necessary data and only when\nrequired. For more information see CISA’s infographic Layering Network Security\nThrough Segmentation. [14]\n\n\n\nConsider using virtual private networks (VPNs) at specific points to and from the\nsystem rather than allowing separate access points for individual devices or\nvendors.\n\n\n\nUtilize jump boxes to isolate and monitor access to the system.\n\n\n\nEnsure that data can only flow outward from the system – administratively and\nphysically. Use encrypted links to exchange data outside of the system.\n\n\n\nEnforce strict compliance with policies and procedures for remote access, even if\npersonnel complain that it is too difficult.\n\n\n\nIf the system does not use vendor access points and devices, ensure that none\nare active. Use strict hardware, software, and administrative techniques to\nprevent them from becoming covertly active.\n\n\n\nDo not allow vendor-provided system access devices and software to operate\ncontinuously in the system without full awareness of their security posture and\naccess logs.\n\n\n\nInstall and keep current all vendor-provided security systems associated with the\ninstalled vendor access points.\n\n\n\nReview configurations to ensure they are configured securely. Operators typically\nfocus on necessary functionality, so properly securing the configurations and\nremote access may be overlooked.\n\n\n\nConsider penetration testing to validate the system’s security posture and any\nunknown accesses or access vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nAdd additional security features to the system as needed. Do not assume that\none vendor has a monopoly on the security of their equipment; other vendors\nmay produce security features to fill gaps.\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n9\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\n\n\nChange all default passwords throughout the system and update any products\nwith hard-coded passwords, especially in all remote access and security\ncomponents.\n\n\n\nPatch known exploited vulnerabilities whenever possible. Prioritize timely\npatching of all remote access points. Keep operating systems, firewalls, and all\nsecurity features up-to-date.\n\n\n\nContinually monitor remote access logs for suspicious accesses. Securely\naggregate logs for easier monitoring.\n\nRestrict tools and scripts\nLimit access to network and control system application tools and scripts to legitimate\nusers performing legitimate tasks on the control system. Removing the tools and scripts\nentirely and patching embedded control system components for exploitable\nvulnerabilities is often not feasible. Thus, carefully apply access and use limitations to\nparticularly vulnerable processes and components to limit the threat.\nThe control system and any accompanying vendor access points may have been\ndelivered with engineering, configuration, and diagnostic tools pre-installed. Engineers\nuse these tools to configure and modify the system and its processes as needed.\nHowever, such tools can also be used by a malicious actor to manipulate the system,\nwithout needing any special additional tools. Using the system against itself is a\npowerful cyber exploitation technique. Mitigations strategies include:\n1. Identify any engineering, configuration, or diagnostic tools.\n2. Securely store gold copies of these tools external to the system if possible.\n3. Remove all non-critical tools.\n4. Prevent these tools from being reinstalled.\n5. Perform routine audits to check that these tools have not been reinstalled.\n\nConduct regular security audits\nThe owner/operator of the control system should consider performing an independent\nsecurity audit of the system, especially of third-party vendor access points and systems.\nThe owner/operator cannot solely depend on the views, options, and guidance of the\nvendor/integrator that designed, developed, or sold the system. The goal of such an\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n10\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\naudit is to identify and document system vulnerabilities, practices, and procedures that\nshould be eliminated to improve the cyber defensive posture, and ultimately prevent\nmalicious cyber actors from being able to cause their intended effects. Steps to consider\nduring an audit include the following:\n1. Validate all connections (e.g., network, serial, modem, wireless, etc.).\n2. Review system software patching procedures.\n3. Confirm secure storage of gold copies (e.g., OS, firmware, patches,\nconfigurations, etc.).\n4. Verify removal from the system of all non-critical software, services, and tools.\n5. Audit the full asset inventory.\n6. Implement CISA ICS mitigations and best practices. [15] [16]\n7. Monitor system logs and intrusion detection system (IDS) logs.\nMonitoring of access logs, system changes, IDS logs, and other tracking data should be\nperformed continuously, with a deeper look at this data during periodic audits.\n\nImplement a dynamic network environment\nStatic network environments provide malicious actors with persistent knowledge of the\nsystem. A static network can provide cyber actors the opportunity to collect bits of\nintelligence about the system over time, establish long-term accesses into the system,\nand develop the tools and TTPs to affect the control system as intended.\nWhile it may be unrealistic for the administrators of many OT/ICS environments to make\nregular non-critical changes, owner/operators should consider periodically making\nmanageable network changes. A little change can go a long way to disrupt previously\nobtained access by a malicious actor. Consider the following:\n1. Deploy additional firewalls and routers from different vendors.\n2. Modify IP address pools.\n3. Replace outdated hardware (e.g., workstations, servers, printers, etc.).\n4. Upgrade operating systems.\n5. Install or upgrade commercially available security packages for vendor access\npoints and methodologies.\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n11\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\nPlanning these changes with significant forethought can help minimize the impact on\nnetwork operation.\nOwner/operators should familiarize themselves with the risks to the system as outlined\nby the product vendor. These may be described in manuals as the system using\ninsecure protocols for interoperability or certain configurations that may expose the\nsystem in additional ways. Changes to the system to reduce these risks should be\nconsidered and implemented when feasible.\n\nConclusion\nThe combination of integrated, simplified tools and remote accesses creates an\nenvironment ripe for malicious actors to target control systems networks. New ITenabled accesses provide cyber actors with a larger attack surface into cyber-physical\nenvironments. It is vital for OT/ICS defenders to anticipate the TTPs of cyber actors\ncombining IT expertise with engineering know-how. Defenders can employ the\nmitigations listed in this advisory to limit unauthorized access, lock down tools and data\nflows, and deny malicious actors from achieving their desired effects.▪\n\nWorks cited\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\nNational Security Agency (2021), Stop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected Operational\nTechnology. https://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/29/2002630479/-1/-1/0/CSA_STOP-MCAAGAINST-OT_UOO13672321.PDF\nNational Security Agency and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2020), NSA and\nCISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across all Operational Technologies\nand Control Systems. https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/23/2002462846/-1/1/0/OT_ADVISORY-DUAL-OFFICIAL-20200722.PDF\nTenable (2018), The Challenges of Securing Industrial Control Systems from Cyberattacks.\nhttps://www.tenable.com/blog/the-challenges-of-securing-industrial-control-systems-fromcyberattacks\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2022), Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal\nCyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure. https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-110a\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2021), Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical\nInfrastructure. https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2021), Ongoing Cyber Threats to U.S. Water\nand Wastewater Systems. https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-287a\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2020), Ransomware Impacting Pipeline\nOperations. https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-049a\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2021), Chinese Gas Pipeline Intrusion\nCampaign, 2011 to 2013 https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-201a\n\nU/OO/200431-22 | PP-22-1413 | Sep 2022 Ver. 1.0\n\n12\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nNSA, CISA | Control System Defense: Know the Opponent\n\n[9]\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\n[16]\n\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2022), APT Cyber Tools Targeting\nICS/SCADA Devices https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-103a\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2022), Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of\nIndicted State-Sponsored Russian Cyber Actors Targeting the Energy Sector.\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-083a\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers (2016), Securing the Power Grid Against Cyber\nAttack. https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/securing-power-grid-against-cyber-attack\nPBS FRONTLINE (2003), Vulnerability: the power grid?\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cyberwar/vulnerable/grid.html\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2018), Schneider Electric Triconex Tricon\n(Update B). https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/ICSA-18-107-02\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2022), Layering Network Security Through\nSegmentation. https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/layering-network-securitysegmentation_infographic_508_0.pdf\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Recommended Cybersecurity Practices for\nIndustrial Control Systems.\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_\nControl_Systems.pdf\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency\nResponse Team (2016), Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System\nCybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICSCERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf\n\nDisclaimer of endorsement\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or\nguarantees.
