wide variety of services to internal and external users, and many\nservers also store or process sensitive information for the organization. Some of the most common types\nof servers are Web, email, database, infrastructure management, and file servers. This publication\naddresses the general security issues of typical servers.\n\nServers are frequently targeted by attackers because of the value of their data and services. For example,\na server might contain personally identifiable information that could be used to perform identity theft.\nThe following are examples of common security threats to servers:\n\n� Malicious entities may exploit software bugs in the server or its underlying operating system to gain\nunauthorized access to the server.\n\n� Denial of service (DoS) attacks may be directed to the server or its supporting network infrastructure,\ndenying or hindering valid users from making use of its services.\n\n� Sensitive information on the server may be read by unauthorized individuals or changed in an\nunauthorized manner.\n\n� Sensitive information transmitted unencrypted or weakly encrypted between the server and the client\nmay be intercepted.\n\n� Malicious entities may gain unauthorized access to resources elsewhere in the organization’s network\nvia a successful attack on the server.\n\n� Malicious entities may attack other entities after compromising a server. These attacks can be\nlaunched directly (e.g., from the compromised host against an external server) or indirectly (e.g.,\nplacing malicious content on the compromised server that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the\nclients of users accessing the server).\n\nThis document is intended to assist organizations in installing, configuring, and maintaining secure\nservers. More specifically, this document describes, in detail, the following practices to apply:\n\n� Securing, installing, and configuring the underlying operating system\n\n� Securing, installing, and configuring server software\n\n� Maintaining the secure configuration through application of appropriate patches and upgrades,\nsecurity testing, monitoring of logs, and backups of data and operating system files.\n\nThe following key guidelines are recommended to Federal departments and agencies for maintaining a\nsecure server.\n\n**Organizations should carefully plan and address the security aspects of the deployment of a server.**\n\nBecause it is much more difficult to address security once deployment and implementation have occurred,\nsecurity should be carefully considered from the initial planning stage. Organizations are more likely to\nmake decisions about configuring computers appropriately and consistently when they develop and use a\ndetailed, well-designed deployment plan. Developing such a plan will support server administrators in\nmaking the inevitable tradeoff decisions between usability, performance, and risk.\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations often fail to consider the human resource requirements for both deployment and\noperational phases of the server and supporting infrastructure. Organizations should address the\nfollowing points in a deployment plan:\n\n� Types of personnel required (e.g., system and server administrators, network administrators,\ninformation systems security officers [ISSO])\n\n� Skills and training required by assigned personnel\n\n� Individual (i.e., level of effort required of specific personnel types) and collective staffing (i.e.,\noverall level of effort) requirements.\n\n**Organizations should implement appropriate security management practices and controls when**\n**maintaining and operating a secure server.**\n\nAppropriate management practices are essential to operating and maintaining a secure server. Security\npractices entail the identification of an organization’s information system assets and the development,\ndocumentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines that help to ensure\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system resources. To ensure the security of a\nserver and the supporting network infrastructure, the following practices should be implemented:\n\n� Organization-wide information system security policy\n\n� Configuration/change control and management\n\n� Risk assessment and management\n\n� Standardized software configurations that satisfy the information system security policy\n\n� Security awareness and training\n\n� Contingency planning, continuity of operations, and disaster recovery planning\n\n� Certification and accreditation.\n\n**Organizations should ensure that the server operating system is deployed, configured, and**\n**managed to meet the security requirements of the organization.**\n\nThe first step in securing a server is securing the underlying operating system. Most commonly available\nservers operate on a general-purpose operating system. Many security issues can be avoided if the\noperating systems underlying servers are configured appropriately. Default hardware and software\nconfigurations are typically set by manufacturers to emphasize features, functions, and ease of use, at the\nexpense of security. Because manufacturers are not aware of each organization’s security needs, each\nserver administrator must configure new servers to reflect their organization’s security requirements and\nreconfigure them as those requirements change. Using security configuration guides or checklists can\nassist administrators in securing servers consistently and efficiently. Securing an operating system\ninitially would generally include the following steps:\n\n� Patch and upgrade the operating system\n\n� Remove or disable unnecessary services, applications, and network protocols\n\n� Configure operating system user authentication\n\n\n-----\n\n� Configure resource controls\n\n� Install and configure additional security controls, if needed\n\n� Perform security testing of the operating system.\n\n**Organizations should ensure that the server application is deployed, configured, and managed to**\n**meet the security requirements of the organization.**\n\nIn many respects, the secure installation and configuration of the server application will mirror the\noperating system process discussed above. The overarching principle is to install the minimal amount of\nservices required and eliminate any known vulnerabilities through patches or upgrades. If the installation\nprogram installs any unnecessary applications, services, or scripts, they should be removed immediately\nafter the installation process concludes. Securing the server application would generally include the\nfollowing steps:\n\n� Patch and upgrade the server application\n\n� Remove or disable unnecessary services, applications, and sample content\n\n� Configure server user authentication and access controls\n\n� Configure server resource controls\n\n� Test the security of the server application (and server content, if applicable).\n\nMany servers also use authentication and encryption technologies to restrict who can access the server\nand to protect information transmitted between the server and its clients. Organizations should\nperiodically examine the services and information accessible on the server and determine the necessary\nsecurity requirements. Organizations should also be prepared to migrate their servers to stronger\ncryptographic technologies as weaknesses are identified in the servers’ existing cryptographic\ntechnologies. For example, NIST has recommended that use of the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) be\nphased out by 2010 in favor of SHA-224, SHA-256, and other larger, stronger hash functions.\nOrganizations should stay aware of cryptographic requirements and plan to update their servers\naccordingly.\n\n**Organizations should commit to the ongoing process of maintaining the security of servers to**\n**ensure continued security.**\n\nMaintaining a secure server requires constant effort, resources, and vigilance from an organization.\nSecurely administering a server on a daily basis is an essential aspect of server security. Maintaining the\nsecurity of a server will usually involve the following actions:\n\n� Configuring, protecting, and analyzing log files on an ongoing and frequent basis\n\n� Backing up critical information frequently\n\n� Establishing and following procedures for recovering from compromise\n\n� Testing and applying patches in a timely manner\n\n� Testing security periodically.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 1. Introduction\n\n\n**1.1** **Authority**\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its\nstatutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,\nPublic Law 107-347.\n\nNIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for\nproviding adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and\nguidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements\nof the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency\nInformation Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental\ninformation is provided in A-130, Appendix III.\n\nThis guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental\norganizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.\n\nNothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and\nbinding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these\nguidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,\nDirector of the OMB, or any other Federal official.\n\n**1.2** **Purpose and Scope**\n\nThe purpose of this document is to assist organizations in understanding the fundamental activities\nperformed as part of securing and maintaining the security of servers that provide services over network\ncommunications as a main function. Hosts that incidentally provide one or a few services for\nmaintenance or accessibility purposes, such as a remote access service for remote troubleshooting, are not\nconsidered servers in this document. The types of servers this publication addresses include outwardfacing publicly accessible servers, such as web and email services, and a wide range of inward-facing\nservers. This document discusses the need to secure servers and provides recommendations for selecting,\nimplementing, and maintaining the necessary security controls.\n\nThis document addresses common servers that use general operating systems (OS) such as Unix, Linux,\nand Windows. Many of the recommendations in this document may also be applicable to servers that use\nspecialized OSs or run on proprietary appliances, but other recommendations will not be implementable\nor may have unintended consequences, so such servers are considered outside the scope of this document.\nOther types of servers outside the scope of this document are virtual servers and highly specialized\nservers, particularly security infrastructure devices (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems), which\nhave unusual configurations and security needs.\n\nOther NIST documents, such as Special Publication (SP) 800-45 Version 2, Guidelines on Electronic\n_Mail Security and SP 800-44 Version 2, Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers, provide_\nrecommendations for particular types of servers. The recommendations in this document are intended as\na foundation for other server-related documents and do not override more specific recommendations\nmade in such documents.\n\n\n-----\n\n**1.3** **Audience**\n\nThis document has been created primarily for system administrators and security administrators who are\nresponsible for the technical aspects of securing servers. The material in this document is technically\noriented, and it is assumed that readers have at least a basic understanding of system and network\nsecurity.\n\n**1.4** **Document Structure**\n\nThe remainder of this document is organized into the following major sections:\n\n� Section 2 provides background information about servers and presents an overview of server security\nconcerns. It also introduces the high-level steps for securing a server.\n\n� Section 3 discusses the security planning and management for servers.\n\n� Section 4 presents an overview of securing a server’s operating system.\n\n� Section 5 discusses the actions needed to securely install and configure server software, such as Web\nserver software and email server software.\n\n� Section 6 provides recommendations for maintaining the security of a server.\n\nThe document also contains appendices with supporting material:\n\n� Appendix A contains a glossary.\n\n� Appendix B contains a list of acronyms and abbreviations.\n\n� Appendix C lists print and online resources that may be helpful for understanding general server\nsecurity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2. Background\n\n\nA server is a host that provides one or more services for other hosts over a network as a primary\nfunction.[1] For example, a file server provides file sharing services so that users can access, modify, store,\nand delete files. Another example is a database server that provides database services for Web\napplications on Web servers. The Web servers, in turn, provide Web content services to users’ Web\nbrowsers. There are many other types of servers, such as application, authentication, directory services,\nemail, infrastructure management, logging, name/address resolution services (e.g., Domain Name Server\n\n[DNS]), print, and remote access.\n\nThis section provides background information on server security. It first discusses common server\nvulnerabilities and threats, and places them in the context of the types of environments in which servers\nare deployed. Next, it explains how the security needs of a server can be categorized so that the\nappropriate security controls can be determined. The section also gives an overview of the basic steps\nthat are required to ensure the security of a server and explains fundamental principles of securing\nservers.\n\n**2.1** **Server Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Environments**\n\nTo secure a server, it is essential to first define the threats that must be mitigated. Knowledge of potential\nthreats is important to understanding the reasons behind the various baseline technical security practices\npresented in this document. Many threats against data and resources are possible because of mistakes—\neither bugs in operating system and server software that create exploitable vulnerabilities, or errors made\nby end users and administrators. Threats may involve intentional actors (e.g., attacker who wants to\naccess information on a server) or unintentional actors (e.g., administrator who forgets to disable user\naccounts of a former employee.) Threats can be local, such as a disgruntled employee, or remote, such as\nan attacker in another geographical area. Organizations should conduct risk assessments to identify the\nspecific threats against their servers and determine the effectiveness of existing security controls in\ncounteracting the threats; they then should perform risk mitigation to decide what additional measures (if\nany) should be implemented, as discussed in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-30, Risk Assessment\n_Guide for Information Technology Systems. Performing risk assessments and mitigation helps_\norganizations better understand their security posture and decide how their servers should be secured.\n\nThe baseline technical security practices presented in this publication are based on commonly accepted\ntechnical security principles and practices, documented in various NIST SPs (including SP 800-14, SP\n800-23, and SP 800-53) and other sources such as the Department of Defense (DoD) Information\n_Assurance Technical Framework. In particular, NIST SP 800-27, Engineering Principles for Information_\n_Technology Security (A Baseline for Achieving Security), contains a set of engineering principles for_\nsystem security that provide a foundation upon which a more consistent and structured approach to the\ndesign, development, and implementation of IT security capabilities can be constructed.\n\nAn important element of planning the appropriate security controls for a server is understanding the\nthreats associated with the environment in which the server is deployed.[2] The recommendations in this\npublication are based on the assumption that the servers are in typical enterprise environments and thus\nface the threats and have the security needs usually associated with such environments. Organizations\n\n1 For the purposes of this document, a host that does not provide services for other hosts as a primary function, but\nincidentally provides one or a few services for maintenance or accessibility purposes, is not considered a server. An\nexample is a laptop that has a remote access service enabled so that IT support staff can remotely maintain the laptop and\nperform troubleshooting.\n2 Additional information on environments is available from NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration Checklists Program for\n_IT Products: Guidance for Checklists Users and Developers_ [(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\ndeploying servers in higher-security environments are likely to need to employ more restrictive security\ncontrols than the recommendations in this publication. For servers in legacy environments, organizations\nshould secure them as if they were in a typical enterprise environment or a higher-security environment,\nas appropriate, and make the minimum possible security control alterations to facilitate legacy access.\n\n**2.2** **Security Categorization of Information and Information Systems**\n\nThe classic model for information security defines three objectives of security: maintaining\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality refers to protecting information from being\naccessed by unauthorized parties. Integrity refers to ensuring the authenticity of information—that\ninformation is not altered, and that the source of the information is genuine. Availability means that\ninformation is accessible by authorized users. Each objective addresses a different aspect of providing\nprotection for information.\n\nDetermining how strongly a system needs to be protected is based largely on the type of information that\nthe system processes and stores. For example, a system containing medical records probably needs much\nstronger protection than a computer only used for viewing publicly released documents. This is not to\nimply that the second system does not need protection; every system needs to be protected, but the level\nof protection may vary based on the value of the system and its data. Federal Information Processing\nStandards (FIPS) Publication (PUB) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information\n_and Information System establishes criteria for determining the security category of a system.[3] FIPS PUB_\n199 defines three security categories—low, moderate, and high—based on the potential impact of a\nsecurity breach involving a particular system:\n\n� “The potential impact is LOW if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected\nto have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. A\nlimited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability\nmight (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is\nable to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii)\nresult in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in\nminor harm to individuals.\n\n� The potential impact is MODERATE if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be\nexpected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or\nindividuals. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or\navailability might (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration\nthat the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is\nsignificantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in\nsignificant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of\nlife or serious life threatening injuries.\n\n� The potential impact is HIGH if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected\nto have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or\nindividuals. A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of\nconfidentiality, integrity, or availability might (i) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission\ncapability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its\nprimary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial\nloss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life\nthreatening injuries.”\n\n3 FIPS PUB 199 is available for download from [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nEach system, including all servers that are part of the system, should be protected based on the potential\nimpact to the system of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Protection measures (otherwise\nknown as security controls) tend to fall into two categories. First, security weaknesses in the system need\nto be resolved. For example, if a system has a known vulnerability that attackers could exploit, the\nsystem should be patched so that the vulnerability is removed or mitigated. Second, the system should\noffer only the required functionality to each authorized user, so that no one can use functions that are not\nnecessary. This principle is known as least privilege. Limiting functionality and resolving security\nweaknesses have a common goal: give attackers as few opportunities as possible to breach a system.\n\nA common problem with security controls is that they often make systems less convenient or more\ndifficult to use. When usability is an issue, many users will attempt to circumvent security controls; for\nexample, if passwords must be long and complex, users may write them down. Balancing security,\nfunctionality, and usability is often a challenge. This guide attempts to strike a proper balance and make\nrecommendations that provide a reasonably secure solution while offering the functionality and usability\nthat users require.\n\nAnother fundamental principle endorsed by this guide is using multiple layers of security—defense in\ndepth. For example, a system may be protected from external attack by several controls, including a\nnetwork-based firewall, a host-based firewall, and OS patching. The motivation for having multiple\nlayers is that if one layer fails or otherwise cannot counteract a certain threat, other layers might prevent\nthe threat from successfully breaching the system. A combination of network-based and host-based\ncontrols is generally most effective at providing consistent protection for systems.\n\nNIST SP 800-53 Revision 2, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, proposes\nminimum baseline management, operational, and technical security controls for information systems.[4]\nThese controls are to be implemented based on the security categorizations proposed by FIPS 199, as\ndescribed earlier in this section. This guidance should assist agencies in meeting baseline requirements\nfor servers deployed in their environments.\n\n**2.3** **Basic Server Security Steps**\n\nA number of steps are required to ensure the security of any server. As a prerequisite for taking any step,\nhowever, it is essential that the organization have a security policy in place. Taking the following steps\nfor server security within the context of the organization’s security policy should prove effective:\n\n1. Plan the installation and deployment of the operating system (OS) and other components for the\nserver. Section 3 addresses this step.\n\n2. Install, configure, and secure the underlying OS. This is discussed in Section 4.\n\n3. Install, configure, and secure the server software. Section 5 describes this step.\n\n4. For servers that host content, such as Web servers (Web pages), database servers (databases), and\ndirectory servers (directories), ensure that the content is properly secured. This is highly dependent\non the type of server and the type of content, so it is outside the scope of this publication to provide\nrecommendations for content security. Readers should consult relevant NIST publications (see\nAppendix C) and other sources of security recommendations for information on securing server\ncontent.\n\n4 NIST SP 800-53 Revision 2, created in response to FISMA, is available at [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Employ appropriate network protection mechanisms (e.g., firewall, packet filtering router, and\nproxy). Choosing the mechanisms for a particular situation depends on several factors, including the\nlocation of the server’s clients (e.g., Internet, internal, internal and remote access), the location of the\nserver on the network, the types of services offered by the server, and the types of threats against the\nserver. Accordingly, this publication does not present recommendations for selecting network\nprotection mechanisms. NIST SP 800-41, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy and NIST SP\n800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), contain additional information\non network protection mechanisms.\n\n6. Employ secure administration and maintenance processes, including application of patches and\nupgrades, monitoring of logs, backups of data and OS, and periodic security testing. This step is\ndescribed in Section 6.\n\nThe practices recommended in this document are designed to help mitigate the risks associated with\nservers. They build on and assume the implementation of practices described in the NIST publications on\nsystem and network security listed in Appendix C.\n\n**2.4** **Server Security Principles**\n\nWhen addressing server security issues, it is an excellent idea to keep in mind the following general\ninformation security principles:[5]\n\n� **Simplicity—Security mechanisms (and information systems in general) should be as simple as**\npossible. Complexity is at the root of many security issues.\n\n� **Fail-Safe—If a failure occurs, the system should fail in a secure manner, i.e., security controls and**\nsettings remain in effect and are enforced. It is usually better to lose functionality rather than\nsecurity.\n\n� **Complete Mediation—Rather than providing direct access to information, mediators that enforce**\naccess policy should be employed. Common examples of mediators include file system permissions,\nproxies, firewalls, and mail gateways.\n\n� **Open Design—System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its**\ncomponents.\n\n� **Separation of Privilege—Functions, to the degree possible, should be separate and provide as much**\ngranularity as possible. The concept can apply to both systems and operators and users. In the case\nof systems, functions such as read, edit, write, and execute should be separate. In the case of system\noperators and users, roles should be as separate as possible. For example, if resources allow, the role\nof system administrator should be separate from that of the database administrator.\n\n� **Least Privilege—This principle dictates that each task, process, or user is granted the minimum**\nrights required to perform its job. By applying this principle consistently, if a task, process, or user is\ncompromised, the scope of damage is constrained to the limited resources available to the\ncompromised entity.\n\n5 Derived from Matt Curtin, Developing Trust: Online Privacy and Security, November 2001 and from Jerome H. Saltzer and\nMichael Schroeder, “The Protection of Information in Computer Systems,” Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 63, pages 1278–\n1308\n\n\n-----\n\n� **Psychological Acceptability—Users should understand the necessity of security. This can be**\nprovided through training and education. In addition, the security mechanisms in place should\npresent users with sensible options that give them the usability they require on a daily basis. If users\nfind the security mechanisms too cumbersome, they may devise ways to work around or compromise\nthem. The objective is not to weaken security so it is understandable and acceptable, but to train and\neducate users and to design security mechanisms and policies that are usable and effective.\n\n� **Least Common Mechanism—When providing a feature for the system, it is best to have a single**\nprocess or service gain some function without granting that same function to other parts of the\nsystem. The ability for the Web server process to access a back-end database, for instance, should not\nalso enable other applications on the system to access the back-end database.\n\n� **Defense-in-Depth—Organizations should understand that a single security mechanism is generally**\ninsufficient. Security mechanisms (defenses) need to be layered so that compromise of a single\nsecurity mechanism is insufficient to compromise a host or network. No “silver bullet” exists for\ninformation system security.\n\n� **Work Factor—Organizations should understand what it would take to break the system or network’s**\nsecurity features. The amount of work necessary for an attacker to break the system or network\nshould exceed the value that the attacker would gain from a successful compromise.\n\n� **Compromise Recording—Records and logs should be maintained so that if a compromise does**\noccur, evidence of the attack is available to the organization. This information can assist in securing\nthe network and host after the compromise and aid in identifying the methods and exploits used by\nthe attacker. This information can be used to better secure the host or network in the future. In\naddition, these records and logs can assist organizations in identifying and prosecuting attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3. Server Security Planning\n\n\nThe most critical aspect of deploying a secure server is careful planning before installation, configuration,\nand deployment. Careful planning will ensure that the server is as secure as possible and in compliance\nwith all relevant organizational policies. Many server security and performance problems can be traced to\na lack of planning or management controls. The importance of management controls cannot be\noverstated. In many organizations, the IT support structure is highly fragmented. This fragmentation\nleads to inconsistencies, and these inconsistencies can lead to security vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**3.1** **Installation and Deployment Planning**\n\nSecurity should be considered from the initial planning stage at the beginning of the systems development\nlife cycle to maximize security and minimize costs. It is much more difficult and expensive to address\nsecurity after deployment and implementation. Organizations are more likely to make decisions about\nconfiguring hosts appropriately and consistently if they begin by developing and using a detailed, welldesigned deployment plan. Developing such a plan enables organizations to make informed tradeoff\ndecisions between usability and performance, and risk. A deployment plan allows organizations to\nmaintain secure configurations and aids in identifying security vulnerabilities, which often manifest\nthemselves as deviations from the plan.\n\nIn the planning stages of a server, the following items should be considered:[6]\n\n� Identify the purpose(s) of the server.\n\n###### – What information categories will be stored on the server? \n\n – What information categories will be processed on or transmitted through the server? \n\n – What are the security requirements for this information?\n\n – Will any information be retrieved from or stored on another host (e.g., database server, directory\nserver, Web server, Network Attached Storage (NAS) server, Storage Area Network (SAN)\nserver)?\n\n###### – What are the security requirements for any other hosts involved? \n\n – What other service(s) will be provided by the server (in general, dedicating the host to only one\nservice is the most secure option)?\n\n###### – What are the security requirements for these additional services?\n\n – What are the requirements for continuity of services provided by the server, such as those\nspecified in continuity of operations plans and disaster recovery plans?\n\n###### – Where on the network will the server be located?\n\n� Identify the network services that will be provided on the server, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol\n(HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Network File System\n\n6 Content derived from Julia Allen et al., Securing Network Servers, April 2000,\n[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n(NFS), or database services (e.g., Open Database Connectivity [ODBC]). The network protocols to\nbe used for each service (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) should also be identified.\n\n� Identify any network service software, both client and server, to be installed on the server and any\nother support servers.\n\n� Identify the users or categories of users of the server and any support hosts.\n\n� Determine the privileges that each category of user will have on the server and support hosts.\n\n� Determine how the server will be managed (e.g., locally, remotely from the internal network,\nremotely from external networks).\n\n� Decide if and how users will be authenticated and how authentication data will be protected.\n\n� Determine how appropriate access to information resources will be enforced.\n\n� Determine which server applications meet the organization’s requirements. Consider servers that\nmay offer greater security, albeit with less functionality in some instances. Some issues to consider\ninclude—\n\n###### – Cost\n\n – Compatibility with existing infrastructure\n\n – Knowledge of existing employees \n\n – Existing manufacturer relationship\n\n – Past vulnerability history\n\n – Functionality.\n\n� Work closely with manufacturer(s) in the planning stage.\n\nThe choice of server application may determine the choice of OS. However, to the degree possible,\nserver administrators should choose an OS that provides the following:[7]\n\n� Ability to granularly restrict administrative or root level activities to authorized users only\n\n� Ability to granularly control access to data on the server\n\n� Ability to disable unnecessary network services that may be built into the OS or server software\n\n� Ability to control access to various forms of executable programs, such as Common Gateway\nInterface (CGI) scripts and server plug-ins for Web servers, if applicable\n\n� Ability to log appropriate server activities to detect intrusions and attempted intrusions\n\n7 Content derived from Julia Allen et al., Securing Network Servers, April 2000,\n[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n� Provision of a host-based firewall capability to restrict both incoming and outgoing traffic\n\n� Support for strong authentication protocols and encryption algorithms\n\nIn addition, organizations should consider the availability of trained, experienced staff to administer the\nserver. Many organizations have learned the difficult lesson that a capable and experienced administrator\nfor one type of operating environment is not automatically as effective for another.\n\nMany servers host sensitive information, and many others, such as public-facing Web servers, should be\ntreated as sensitive because of the damage to the organization’s reputation that could occur if the servers’\nintegrity is compromised. In such cases, it is critical that the servers are located in secure physical\nenvironments. When planning the location of a server, the following issues should be considered:\n\n� Are the appropriate physical security protection mechanisms in place for the server and its\nnetworking components (e.g., routers, switches)? Examples include—\n\n###### – Locks\n\n – Card reader access\n\n – Security guards\n\n – Physical intrusion detection systems (e.g., motion sensors, cameras).\n\n� Are there appropriate environmental controls so that the necessary humidity and temperature are\nmaintained? If high availability is required, are there redundant environmental controls?\n\n� Is there a backup power source? For how long will it provide power?\n\n� Is there appropriate fire containment equipment? Does it minimize damage to equipment that would\notherwise not be impacted by the fire?\n\n� If high availability is required, are there redundant network connections? (For Internet-facing servers,\nthis generally means Internet connections from at least two different Internet service providers [ISP].)\nIs there another data center that can be used to host servers in the event of a catastrophe at the original\ndata center?\n\n� If the location is subject to known natural disasters, is it hardened against those disasters and/or is\nthere a contingency site outside the potential disaster area?\n\n**3.2** **Security Management Staff**\n\nBecause server security is tightly intertwined with the organization’s general information system security\nposture, a number of IT and system security staff may be involved in server planning, implementation,\nand administration. This section provides a list of generic roles and identifies their responsibilities as they\nrelate to server security. These roles are for the purpose of discussion and may vary by organization.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.2.1**\n\n\n**Chief Information Officer**\n\n\nThe Chief Information Officer (CIO) ensures that the organization’s security posture is adequate. The\nCIO provides direction and advisory services for the protection of information systems for the entire\norganization. The CIO is responsible for the following activities associated with servers:\n\n� Coordinating the development and maintenance of the organization’s information security policies,\nstandards, and procedures\n\n� Coordinating the development and maintenance of the organization’s change control and management\nprocedures\n\n� Ensuring the establishment of, and compliance with, consistent IT security policies for departments\nthroughout the organization.\n\n\n**3.2.2**\n\n\n**Information Systems Security Program Managers**\n\n\nThe Information Systems Security Program Managers (ISSPM) oversee the implementation of and\ncompliance with the standards, rules, and regulations specified in the organization’s security policy. The\nISSPMs are responsible for the following activities associated with servers:\n\n� Ensuring that security procedures are developed and implemented\n\n� Ensuring that security policies, standards, and requirements are followed\n\n� Ensuring that all critical systems are identified and that contingency planning, disaster recovery plans,\nand continuity of operations plans exist for these critical systems\n\n� Ensuring that critical systems are identified and scheduled for periodic security testing according to\nthe security policy requirements of each respective system.\n\n\n**3.2.3**\n\n\n**Information Systems Security Officers**\n\n\nInformation Systems Security Officers (ISSO) are responsible for overseeing all aspects of information\nsecurity within a specific organizational entity. They ensure that the organization’s information security\npractices comply with organizational and departmental policies, standards, and procedures. ISSOs are\nresponsible for the following activities associated with servers:\n\n� Developing internal security standards and procedures for the servers and supporting network\ninfrastructure\n\n� Cooperating in the development and implementation of security tools, mechanisms, and mitigation\ntechniques\n\n� Maintaining standard configuration profiles for the servers and supporting network infrastructure\ncontrolled by the organization, including, but not limited to, OSs, firewalls, routers, and server\napplications\n\n� Maintaining operational integrity of systems by conducting security tests and ensuring that designated\nIT professionals are conducting scheduled testing on critical systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.2.4 Server, Network, and Security Administrators**\n\nServer administrators are system architects responsible for the overall design, implementation, and\nmaintenance of a server. Network administrators are responsible for the overall design, implementation,\nand maintenance of a network. Security administrators are dedicated to performing information security\nfunctions for servers and other hosts, as well as networks. Organizations that have a dedicated\ninformation security team usually have security administrators. On a daily basis, server, network, and\nsecurity administrators contend with the security requirements of the specific systems for which they are\nresponsible. Security issues and solutions can originate from either outside (e.g., security patches and\nfixes from the manufacturer or computer security incident response teams) or within the organization\n(e.g., the security office). The administrators are responsible for the following activities associated with\nservers:\n\n� Installing and configuring systems in compliance with the organizational security policies and\nstandard system and network configurations\n\n� Maintaining systems in a secure manner, including frequent backups and timely application of\npatches\n\n� Monitoring system integrity, protection levels, and security-related events\n\n� Following up on detected security anomalies associated with their information system resources\n\n� Conducting security tests as required.\n\n**3.3** **Management Practices**\n\nAppropriate management practices are critical to operating and maintaining a secure server. Security\npractices entail the identification of an organization’s information system assets and the development,\ndocumentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines that ensure\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system resources.\n\nTo ensure the security of a server and the supporting network infrastructure, organizations should\nimplement the following practices:\n\n� **Organizational Information System Security Policy—A security policy should specify the basic**\ninformation system security tenets and rules, and their intended internal purpose. The policy should\nalso outline who in the organization is responsible for particular areas of information security (e.g.,\nimplementation, enforcement, audit, review). The policy must be enforced consistently throughout\nthe organization to be effective. Generally, the CIO is responsible for drafting the organization’s\nsecurity policy.\n\n� **Configuration/Change Control and Management—The process of controlling modification to a**\nsystem’s design, hardware, firmware, and software provides sufficient assurance that the system is\nprotected against the introduction of an improper modification before, during, and after system\nimplementation. Configuration control leads to consistency with the organization’s information\nsystem security policy. Configuration control is traditionally overseen by a configuration control\nboard that is the final authority on all proposed changes to an information system. If resources allow,\nconsider the use of development, quality assurance, and/or test environments so that changes can be\nvetted and tested before deployment in production.\n\n\n-----\n\n� **Risk Assessment and Management—Risk assessment is the process of analyzing and interpreting**\nrisk. It involves determining an assessment’s scope and methodology, collecting and analyzing riskrelated data, and interpreting the risk analysis results. Collecting and analyzing risk data requires\nidentifying assets, threats, vulnerabilities, safeguards, consequences, and the probability of a\nsuccessful attack. Risk management is the process of selecting and implementing controls to reduce\nrisk to a level acceptable to the organization.\n\n� **Standardized Configurations—Organizations should develop standardized secure configurations**\nfor widely used OSs and server software. This will provide recommendations to server and network\nadministrators on how to configure their systems securely and ensure consistency and compliance\nwith the organizational security policy. Because it only takes one insecurely configured host to\ncompromise a network, organizations with a significant number of hosts are especially encouraged to\napply this recommendation.\n\n� **Secure Programming Practices—Organizations should** adopt secure application development\nguidelines to ensure that they develop their applications for servers in a sufficiently secure manner.\n\n� **Security Awareness and Training—A security training program is critical to the overall security**\nposture of an organization. Making users and administrators aware of their security responsibilities\nand teaching the correct practices helps them change their behavior to conform to security best\npractices. Training also supports individual accountability, which is an important method for\nimproving information system security. If the user community includes members of the general\npublic, providing security awareness specifically targeting them might also be appropriate.\n\n� **Contingency, Continuity of Operations, and Disaster Recovery Planning—Contingency plans,**\ncontinuity of operations plans, and disaster recovery plans are established in advance to allow an\norganization or facility to maintain operations in the event of a disruption.[8]\n\n� **Certification and Accreditation—Certification in the context of information system security means**\nthat a system has been analyzed to determine how well it meets all of the security requirements of the\norganization. Accreditation occurs when the organization’s management accepts that the system\nmeets the organization’s security requirements.[ 9]\n\n**3.4** **System Security Plan**\n\nThe objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information system resources.[10]\nPlans that adequately protect information assets require managers and information owners—directly\naffected by and interested in the information and/or processing capabilities—to be convinced that their\ninformation assets are adequately protected from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or modification,\nunavailability, and undetected activities.\n\nThe purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security and privacy\nrequirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.\nThe system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who\naccess the system. The system security plan should be viewed as documentation of the structured process\n\n8 For more information, see NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems\n[(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n9 For more information on certification and accreditation, see NIST SP 800-37, Federal Guidelines for the Security\n_[Certification and Accreditation of Information Technology Systems (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)_\n10 Material in this subsection is derived from NIST SP 800-18 Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal\n_[Information Systems (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)_\n\n\n-----\n\nof planning adequate, cost-effective security protection for a system. It should reflect input from various\nmanagers with responsibilities concerning the system, including information owners, the system owner,\nand the ISSPM.\n\nFor Federal agencies, all information systems must be covered by a system security plan. Other\norganizations should strongly consider the completion of a system security plan for each of their systems\nas well. The information system owner[11] is generally the party responsible for ensuring that the security\nplan is developed and maintained and that the system is deployed and operated according to the agreedupon security requirements.\n\nIn general, an effective system security plan should include the following:\n\n� **System Identification—The first sections of the system security plan provide basic identifying**\ninformation about the system. They contain general information such as the key points of contact for\nthe system, the purpose of the system, the sensitivity level of the system, and the environment in\nwhich the system is deployed, including the network environment, the system’s placement on the\nnetwork, and the system’s relationships with other systems.\n\n� **Controls—This section of the plan describes the control measures (in place or planned) that are**\nintended to meet the protection requirements of the information system. Controls fall into three\ngeneral categories:\n\n###### – Management controls, which focus on the management of the computer security system and the\nmanagement of risk for a system.\n\n###### – Operational controls, which are primarily implemented and executed by people (rather than\nsystems). They often require technical or specialized expertise, and often rely upon management\nactivities as well as technical controls.\n\n###### – Technical controls, which are security mechanisms that the computer system employs. The\ncontrols can provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate\ndetection of security violations, and support security requirements for applications and data. The\nimplementation of technical controls, however, always requires significant operational\nconsiderations and should be consistent with the management of security within the\norganization.[12]\n\n**3.5** **Human Resources Requirements**\n\nThe greatest challenge and expense in developing and securely maintaining a server is providing the\nnecessary human resources to adequately perform the required functions. Many organizations fail to fully\nrecognize the amount of expense and skills required to field a secure server. This failure often results in\noverworked employees and insecure systems. From the initial planning stages, organizations need to\ndetermine the necessary human resource requirements. Appropriate and sufficient human resources are\n\n11 The information system owner is responsible for defining the system’s operating parameters, authorized functions, and\nsecurity requirements. The information owner for information stored within, processed by, or transmitted by a system may\nor may not be the same as the information system owner. In addition, a single system may use information from multiple\ninformation owners.\n12 For more detail on management, operational, and technical controls, see NIST SP 800-53 Revision 2, Recommended\n_Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for_\n_[Managers (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)_\n\n\n-----\n\nthe single most important aspect of effective server security. Organizations should also consider the fact\nthat, in general, technical solutions are not a substitute for skilled and experienced personnel.\n\nWhen considering the human resource implications of developing and deploying a server, organizations\nshould consider the following:\n\n� **Required Personnel—What types of personnel are required? Examples of possible positions are**\nsystem administrators, server administrators, network administrators, and ISSOs.\n\n� **Required Skills—What are the required skills to adequately plan, develop, and maintain the server in**\na secure manner? Examples include OS administration, network administration, and programming.\n\n� **Available Personnel—What are the available human resources within the organization? In addition,**\nwhat are their current skill sets and are they sufficient for supporting the server? Often, an\norganization discovers that its existing human resources are not sufficient and needs to consider the\nfollowing options:\n\n###### – Train Current Staff—If personnel are available but they do not have the requisite skills, the\norganization may choose to train the existing staff in the skills required. Although this is an\nexcellent option, the organization should ensure that employees meet all prerequisites for training.\n\n###### – Acquire Additional Staff—If not enough staff members are available or they do not have the\nrequisite skills, it may be necessary to hire additional personnel or use external resources.\n\nOnce the organization has staffed the project and the server is active, it will be necessary to ensure the\nnumber and skills of the personnel are still adequate. The threat and vulnerability levels of IT systems,\nincluding servers, are constantly changing, as is the technology. This means that what is adequate today\nmay not be tomorrow, so staffing needs should be reassessed periodically and additional training and\nother skills-building activities conducted as needed.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 4. Securing the Server Operating System\n\n\nMost commonly available servers operate on a general-purpose OS. Many security issues can be avoided\nif the OSs underlying the servers are configured appropriately. Because manufacturers are unaware of\neach organization’s security needs, server administrators need to configure new servers to reflect their\norganizations’ security requirements and reconfigure them as those requirements change. The practices\nrecommended here are designed to help server administrators with server security configuration. Server\nadministrators managing existing servers should confirm that their servers address the issues discussed.\n\nThe techniques for securing different OSs vary greatly; therefore, this section includes the generic\nprocedures common in securing most OSs. Security configuration guides and checklists for many OSs\nare publicly available; these documents typically contain recommendations for settings stronger than the\ndefault level of security, and they may also contain step-by-step instructions for securing servers.[13] In\naddition, many organizations maintain their own guidelines specific to their requirements. Some\nautomated tools also exist for securing OSs, and their use is recommended.\n\nAfter planning the installation and deployment of the OS, as described in Section 3, and installing the OS,\nthe following basic steps are necessary to secure the OS:\n\n� Patch and update the OS\n\n� Harden and configure the OS to address security adequately\n\n� Install and configure additional security controls, if needed\n\n� Test the security of the OS to ensure that the previous steps adequately addressed all security issues.\n\nThe combined result of these steps should be a reasonable level of protection for the server’s OS.\n\n**4.1** **Patch and Upgrade Operating System**\n\nOnce an OS is installed, applying needed patches or upgrades to correct for known vulnerabilities is\nessential. Any known vulnerabilities an OS has should be corrected before using it to host a server or\notherwise exposing it to untrusted users. To adequately detect and correct these vulnerabilities, server\nadministrators should do the following:\n\n� Create, document, and implement a patching process.[14]\n\n� Identify vulnerabilities and applicable patches.[15]\n\n� Mitigate vulnerabilities temporarily if needed and if feasible (until patches are available, tested, and\ninstalled).\n\n� Install permanent fixes (patches, upgrades, etc.)\n\n13 Checklists and implementation guides for various operating systems and applications are available from NIST at\n[http://checklists.nist.gov/. Also, see NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products, available](http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html)\nat the same Web site, for general information about NIST’s checklists program.\n14 For more information, see NIST SP 800-40 Version 2.0, Creating a Patch and Vulnerability Management Program, which\nis available at [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html. A single patch management process can be put into place for](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\nboth operating systems and applications (including server software).\n15 To check for vulnerabilities in OSs, server software, and other applications, see the NIST National Vulnerability Database\n(NVD) at [http://nvd.nist.gov/.](http://nvd.nist.gov/)\n\n\n-----\n\nAdministrators should ensure that servers, particularly new ones, are adequately protected during the\npatching process. For example, a server that is not fully patched or not configured securely could be\ncompromised by threats if it is openly accessible while it is being patched. When preparing new servers\nfor deployment, administrators should do either of the following:\n\n� Keep the servers disconnected from networks or connect them only to an isolated “build” network\nuntil all patches have been transferred to the servers through out-of-band means (e.g., CDs) and\ninstalled, and the other configuration steps listed in this section have been performed.\n\n� Place the servers on a virtual local area network (VLAN)[16] or other network segment that severely\nrestricts what actions the hosts on it can perform and what communications can reach the hosts—only\nallowing those events that are necessary for patching and configuring the hosts. Do not transfer the\nhosts to regular network segments until all the configuration steps listed in this section have been\nperformed.\n\nAdministrators should generally not apply patches to production servers without first testing them on\nanother identically configured server because patches can inadvertently cause unexpected problems with\nproper server operation. Although administrators can configure servers to download patches\nautomatically, the servers should not be configured to install them automatically so that they can first be\ntested.\n\n**4.2** **Hardening and Securely Configuring the OS**\n\nAdministrators should perform the following steps to harden and securely configure a server OS:\n\n� Remove unnecessary services, applications, and network protocols\n\n� Configure OS user authentication\n\n� Configure resource controls appropriately.\n\nThese steps are discussed further in Sections 4.2.1 through 4.2.3. Also, for particularly high-security\nsituations, administrators should consider configuring the OS to act as a bastion host. A bastion host has\nparticularly strong security controls and is configured so as to offer the least functionality possible. The\ndetails of establishing a bastion host are necessarily OS-specific, so they are outside the scope of this\npublication.\n\n\n**4.2.1**\n\n\n**Remove or Disable Unnecessary Services, Applications, and Network Protocols**\n\n\nIdeally, a server should be on a dedicated, single-purpose host. When configuring the OS, remove all\nservices, applications, and network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that are not required, and disable any such\nunnecessary components that cannot be removed. If possible, install the minimal OS configuration and\nthen add, remove, or disable services, applications, and network protocols as needed. Many uninstall\nscripts or programs are far from perfect in completely removing all components of a service, so it is better\nnot to install unnecessary services. Common types of services and applications that should usually be\nremoved if not required (or disabled if they cannot be removed) include the following:\n\n16 VLANs can easily be misconfigured in ways that reduce or eliminate their effectiveness as a security control. Organizations\nplanning to use VLANs should ensure that they are configured properly and that any configuration changes are carefully\nverified.\n\n\n-----\n\n� File and printer sharing services (e.g., Windows Network Basic Input/Output System [NetBIOS] file\nand printer sharing, Network File System [NFS], FTP)\n\n� Wireless networking services\n\n� Remote control and remote access programs, particularly those that do not strongly encrypt their\ncommunications (e.g., Telnet)[17]\n\n� Directory services (e.g., Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAP], Network Information\nSystem [NIS])\n\n� Web servers and services\n\n� Email services (e.g., SMTP)\n\n� Language compilers and libraries\n\n� System development tools\n\n� System and network management tools and utilities, including Simple Network Management Protocol\n(SNMP).\n\nRemoving unnecessary services and applications is preferable to simply disabling them through\nconfiguration settings because attacks that attempt to alter settings and activate a disabled service cannot\nsucceed when the functional components are completely removed. Disabled services could also be\nenabled inadvertently through human error.\n\nRemoving or disabling unnecessary services enhances the security of a server in several ways:[18]\n\n� Other services cannot be compromised and used to attack the host or impair the services of the server.\nEach service added to a host increases the risk of compromise for that host because each service is\nanother possible avenue of access for an attacker. Less is more secure in this case.\n\n� Other services may have defects or may be incompatible with the server itself. By removing or\ndisabling them, they should not affect the server and should potentially improve its availability.\n\n� The host can be configured to better suit the requirements of the particular service. Different services\nmight require different hardware and software configurations, which could lead to unnecessary\nvulnerabilities or negatively affect performance.\n\n� By reducing services, the number of logs and log entries is reduced; therefore, detecting unexpected\nbehavior becomes easier (see Section 6.1).\n\nOrganizations should determine the services to be enabled on a server. Additional services that might be\ninstalled include web servers, database access protocols, file transfer protocols, and remote administration\nservices. These services may be required in certain instances, but they may increase the risks to the\nserver. Whether the risks outweigh the benefits is a decision for each organization to make.\n\n17 If a remote control or remote access program is absolutely required and it does not strongly encrypt its communications, it\nshould be tunneled over a protocol that provides encryption, such as secure shell (SSH) or Internet Protocol Security (IPsec).\n18 Content derived from Julia Allen et al., Securing Network Servers, April 2000,\n[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n**4.2.2**\n\n\n**Configure OS User Authentication**\n\n\nFor servers, the authorized users who can configure the OS are limited to a small number of designated\nserver administrators. The users who can access the server, however, may range from a few authorized\nemployees to the entire Internet community. To enforce policy restrictions, if required, the server\nadministrator should configure the OS to authenticate a prospective user by requiring proof that the user is\nauthorized for such access. Even if a server allows unauthenticated access to most of its services,\nadministrative and other types of specialized access should be limited to specific individuals and groups.\n\nEnabling authentication by the host computer involves configuring parts of the OS, firmware, and\napplications on the server, such as the software that implements a network service. In special situations,\nsuch as high-value/high-risk servers, organizations may also use authentication hardware, such as tokens\nor one-time password devices. Use of authentication mechanisms where authentication information is\nreusable (e.g., passwords) and transmitted in the clear over an untrusted network is strongly discouraged\nbecause the information can be intercepted and used by an attacker to masquerade as an authorized user.\n\nTo ensure the appropriate user authentication is in place, take the following steps:[19]\n\n� **Remove or Disable Unneeded Default Accounts—The default configuration of the OS often**\nincludes guest accounts (with and without passwords), administrator or root level accounts, and\naccounts associated with local and network services. The names and passwords for those accounts\nare well known. Remove (whenever possible) or disable unnecessary accounts to eliminate their use\nby attackers, including guest accounts on computers containing sensitive information. For default\naccounts that need to be retained, including guest accounts, severely restrict access to the accounts,\nincluding changing the names (where possible and particularly for administrator or root level\naccounts) and passwords to be consistent with the organizational password policy. Default account\nnames and passwords are commonly known in the attacker community.\n\n� **Disable Non-Interactive Accounts—Disable accounts (and the associated passwords) that need to**\nexist but do not require an interactive login. For Unix systems, disable the login shell or provide a\nlogin shell with NULL functionality (e.g., /bin/false).\n\n� **Create the User Groups—Assign users to the appropriate groups. Then assign rights to the groups,**\nas documented in the deployment plan. This approach is preferable to assigning rights to individual\nusers, which becomes unwieldy with large numbers of users.\n\n� **Create the User Accounts—The deployment plan identifies who will be authorized to use each**\ncomputer and its services. Create only the necessary accounts. Permit the use of shared accounts\nonly when no viable alternatives exist. Have ordinary user accounts for server administrators that are\nalso users of the server.\n\n� **Configure Automated Time Synchronization—Some authentication protocols, such as Kerberos,**\nwill not function if the time differential between the client host and the authenticating server is\nsignificant, so servers using such protocols should be configured to automatically synchronize system\ntime with a reliable time server. Typically the time server is internal to the organization and uses the\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) for synchronization; publicly available NTP servers are also available\non the Internet.\n\n19 Content derived from Julia Allen et al., Securing Network Servers, April 2000,\n[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n� **Check the Organization’s Password Policy—Set account passwords appropriately. Elements that**\nmay be addressed in a password policy include the following:\n\n###### – Length—a minimum length for passwords.\n\n – Complexity—the mix of characters required. An example is requiring passwords to contain\nuppercase letters, lowercase letters, and nonalphabetic characters, and to not contain “dictionary”\nwords.\n\n###### – Aging—how long a password may remain unchanged. Many policies require users and\nadministrators to change their passwords periodically. In such cases, the frequency should be\ndetermined by the enforced length and complexity of the password, the sensitivity of the\ninformation protected, and the exposure level of passwords. If aging is required, consideration\nshould be given to enforcing a minimum aging duration to prevent users from rapidly cycling\nthrough password changes to clear out their password history and bypass reuse restrictions.\n\n###### – Reuse—whether a password may be reused. Some users try to defeat a password aging\nrequirement by changing the password to one they have used previously. If reuse is prohibited by\npolicy, it is beneficial, if possible, to ensure that users cannot change their passwords by merely\nappending characters to the beginning or end of their original passwords (e.g., original password\nwas “mysecret” and is changed to “1mysecret” or “mysecret1”).\n\n###### – Authority—who is allowed to change or reset passwords and what sort of proof is required\nbefore initiating any changes.\n\n###### – Password Security—how passwords should be secured, such as not storing passwords\nunencrypted on the server, and requiring administrators to use different passwords for their server\nadministration accounts than their other administration accounts.\n\n� **Configure Computers to Prevent Password Guessing—It is relatively easy for an unauthorized**\nuser to try to gain access to a computer by using automated software tools that attempt all passwords.\nIf the OS provides the capability, configure it to increase the period between login attempts with each\nunsuccessful attempt. If that is not possible, the alternative is to deny login after a limited number of\nfailed attempts (e.g., three). Typically, the account is “locked out” for a period of time (such as 30\nminutes) or until a user with appropriate authority reactivates it.\n\nThe choice to deny login is another situation that requires the server administrator to make a decision\nthat balances security and convenience. Implementing this recommendation can help prevent some\nkinds of attacks, but it can also allow an attacker to use failed login attempts to prevent user access,\nresulting in a DoS condition. The risk of DoS from account lockout is much greater if the server is\nexternally accessible and an attacker knows or can surmise a pattern to your naming convention that\nallows them to guess account names.\n\nFailed network login attempts should not prevent an authorized user or administrator from logging in at\nthe console. Note that all failed login attempts, whether via the network or console, should be logged.\nIf the server will not be administered remotely, disable the ability for the administrator or root level\naccounts to log in from the network.\n\n� **Install and Configure Other Security Mechanisms to Strengthen Authentication—If the**\ninformation on the server requires it, consider using other authentication mechanisms such as\nbiometrics, smart cards, client/server certificates, or one-time password systems. They can be more\n\n\n-----\n\nexpensive and difficult to implement, but they may be justified in some circumstances. When such\nauthentication mechanisms and devices are used, the organization’s policy should be changed\naccordingly, if necessary. Some organizational policies may already require the use of strong\nauthentication mechanisms.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, attackers using network sniffers can easily capture passwords passed across a\nnetwork in clear text. However, passwords are economical and appropriate if properly protected while in\ntransit. Organizations should implement authentication and encryption technologies, such as Secure\nSockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), or virtual private networks\nusing IPsec or SSL/TLS, to protect passwords during transmission over untrusted networks. Requiring\nserver authentication to be used with encryption technologies reduces the likelihood of successful man-inthe-middle and spoofing attacks.\n\n\n**4.2.3**\n\n\n**Configure Resource Controls Appropriately**\n\n\nAll commonly used server OSs provide the capability to specify access privileges individually for files,\ndirectories, devices, and other computational resources. By carefully setting access controls and denying\npersonnel unauthorized access, the server administrator can reduce intentional and unintentional security\nbreaches. For example, denying read access to files and directories helps to protect confidentiality of\ninformation, and denying unnecessary write (modify) access can help maintain the integrity of\ninformation. Limiting the execution privilege of most system-related tools to authorized system\nadministrators can prevent users from making configuration changes that could reduce security. It also\ncan restrict the attacker’s ability to use those tools to attack the server or other hosts on the network.\nAuditing should also be enabled as appropriate to monitor attempts to access protected resources.\n\nIn some cases, administrators configure the OS so as to provide an isolated virtual environment that the\nserver software will be run within. This environment, sometimes called a sandbox or a jail, presents a\nlimited set of real or virtual resources that the server software or its users can access. The OS is\nconfigured so that server processes and user actions cannot “break out” of the environment. A common\nexample of an isolated virtual environment is the use of the Unix chroot command to contain anonymous\nFTP activity. Even if a malicious user exploited a vulnerability in the FTP service, the user would only\ngain access to the virtual environment and not to the underlying OS. Details on creating sandbox and jail\nenvironments are OS and server-specific, and therefore are outside the scope of this publication.\n\n**4.3** **Install and Configure Additional Security Controls**\n\nOSs often do not include all of the security controls necessary to secure the OS, services, and applications\nadequately. In such cases, administrators need to select, install, configure, and maintain additional\nsoftware to provide the missing controls. Commonly needed controls include the following:\n\n� Anti-malware software, such as antivirus software, anti-spyware software, and rootkit detectors, to\nprotect the local OS from malware and to detect and eradicate any infections that occur.[20] Examples\nof when anti-malware software would be helpful include a system administrator bringing infected\nmedia to the server and a network service worm contacting the server and infecting it.\n\n� Host-based intrusion detection and prevention software (IDPS), to detect attacks performed against\nthe server, including DoS attacks. For example, one form of host-based IDPS, file integrity checking\nsoftware, can identify changes to critical system files.\n\n20 Additional information on anti-malware software is available from NIST SP 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention\n_and Handling_ [(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n� Host-based firewalls, to protect the server from unauthorized access.[21]\n\n� Patch management or vulnerability management software to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed\npromptly. Patch management and vulnerability management software can be used only to apply\npatches or also to identify new vulnerabilities in the server’s OSs, services, and applications.\n\nSome servers also use disk encryption technologies to protect their stored data from attackers who gain\nphysical access to the servers. Disk encryption technologies are built into some operating systems, and\nthird-party disk encryption products are also available.\n\nWhen planning security controls, server administrators should consider the resources that the security\ncontrols will consume. A server’s performance could degrade if it does not have enough memory and\nprocessing capacity for the controls. Server administrators should also consider any network-based\nsecurity controls, such as network firewalls and intrusion detection systems, that could provide additional\nprotection for the server. If host-based security controls are too resource-intensive for a server or are\notherwise infeasible, server administrators may need to compensate by using additional network-based\nsecurity controls to protect the server’s OS, services, and applications. For many servers, network-based\nsecurity controls are used in addition to host-based security controls to provide additional layers of\nsecurity.\n\n**4.4** **Security Testing the Operating System**\n\nPeriodic security testing of the OS is a vital way to identify vulnerabilities and to ensure that the existing\nsecurity precautions are effective and that security controls are configured properly (for example, the\nrequired cryptographic algorithms are in use to protect network communications). Common methods for\ntesting OSs include vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Vulnerability scanning usually entails\nusing an automated vulnerability scanner to scan a host or group of hosts on a network for application,\nnetwork, and OS vulnerabilities. Penetration testing is a testing process designed to compromise a\nnetwork using the tools and methodologies of an attacker. It involves iteratively identifying and\nexploiting the weakest areas of the network to gain access to the remainder of the network, eventually\ncompromising the overall security of the network. Vulnerability scanning should be conducted\nperiodically, at least weekly to monthly, and penetration testing should be conducted at least annually.\nBecause both of these testing techniques are also applicable to testing the server application, they are\ndiscussed in detail in Section 6.4.[22]\n\nFactors to be considered when deciding whether to test the production server or a similarly configured\nnon-production server include the following:\n\n� The possible impact to the production server. For example, if a certain test technique is likely to\ncause a denial of service, then that technique should probably be used against the non-production\nserver.\n\n� The presence of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). If testing could expose sensitive\nPII, such as Social Security Numbers (SSN) or credit card information, to people without\nauthorization to see it, then organizations should consider performing the testing on a non-production\nserver that holds a false version of the PII (e.g., test data instead of actual sensitive PII).\n\n21 For more information on firewalls, see NIST SP 800-41 Revision 1 (Draft), Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy\n[(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n22 For information on other testing techniques, see NIST SP 800-115 (Draft), Technical Guide to Information Security Testing\n[(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n� How similarly the production and non-production servers can be configured. In practice, there are\nusually inconsistencies between the test and production environments, which can result in missed\nvulnerabilities if the non-production servers are used.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 5. Securing the Server Software\n\n\nOnce the OS has been installed and secured, as described in Section 4, the next step is to install and\nsecure the chosen server software, which is described in this section. Before starting this process, read the\nserver software documentation carefully and understand the various options available during the\ninstallation process. Also, be sure to visit the server software manufacturer’s Web site or a vulnerability\ndatabase Web site, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),[23] to determine whether there are\nknown vulnerabilities and related patches available that should be installed or configured as part of the\nsetup process. Only after these preliminary steps are accomplished should the installation be started.\nNote that this section discusses only generic installation and configuration procedures; specific directions\nfor particular servers are available from server manufacturers and from security checklist repositories.[24]\n\nA partially configured and/or patched server should not be exposed to external networks (e.g., the\nInternet) or external users. In addition, internal network access should be as limited as possible until all\nsoftware is installed, patched, and configured securely. Insecure servers can be compromised in a matter\nof minutes after being placed on the Internet. While it is ideal to fully harden the platform before placing\nit on the network, it is not always feasible. For example, some application development tool\ncombinations cannot be installed, configured, and tested on top of a pre-hardened OS and Web server\nconfiguration. In such situations, stepwise or incremental hardening is a viable option to consider, with\nfull validation of complete hardening occurring at production deployment.\n\n**5.1** **Securely Installing the Server Software**\n\nIn many respects, the secure installation and configuration of the server software mirrors the OS process\ndiscussed in Section 4. The overarching principle, as before, is to install only the services required for the\nserver and to eliminate any known vulnerabilities through patches or upgrades. Any unnecessary\napplications, services, or scripts that are installed should be removed immediately once the installation\nprocess is complete. During the installation of the server software, the following steps should be\nperformed:\n\n� Install the server software either on a dedicated host or on a dedicated guest OS if virtualization is\nbeing employed.\n\n� Apply any patches or upgrades to correct for known vulnerabilities in the server software.\n\n� Create a dedicated physical disk or logical partition (separate from OS and server application) for\nserver data, if applicable.\n\n� Remove or disable all services installed by the server application but not required (e.g., gopher, FTP,\nHTTP, remote administration).\n\n� Remove or disable all unneeded default user accounts created by the server installation.\n\n� Remove all manufacturers’ documentation from the server.\n\n� Remove all example or test files from the server, including sample content, scripts, and executable\ncode.\n\n23 NVD is available at [http://nvd.nist.gov/.](http://nvd.nist.gov/)\n24 NIST hosts a security checklist repository at [http://checklists.nist.gov/.](http://checklists.nist.gov/)\n\n\n-----\n\n� Remove all unneeded compilers.\n\n� Apply the appropriate security template or hardening script to the server.\n\n� For external-facing servers, reconfigure service banners not to report the server and OS type and\nversion, if possible.[25]\n\n� Configure warning banners for all services that support such banners.[26]\n\n� Configure each network service to listen for client connections on only the necessary TCP and UDP\nports, if possible.[27]\n\nOrganizations should consider installing the server with non-standard directory names, directory\nlocations, and filenames if possible. Many server attack tools and worms targeting servers only look for\nfiles and directories in their default locations. While this will not stop determined attackers, it will force\nthem to work harder to compromise the server, and it also increases the likelihood of attack detection\nbecause of the failed attempts to access the default filenames and directories and the additional time\nneeded to perform an attack.\n\n**5.2** **Configuring Access Controls**\n\nMost server OSs provide the capability to specify access privileges individually for files, devices, and\nother computational resources on that host. Any information that the server can access using these\ncontrols can potentially be distributed to all users accessing the server. The server software is likely to\ninclude mechanisms to provide additional file, device, and resource access controls specific to its\noperation. It is important to set identical permissions for both the OS and server application; otherwise,\ntoo much or too little access may be granted to users. Server administrators should consider how best to\nconfigure access controls to protect information stored on servers from two perspectives:\n\n� Limit the access of the server application to a subset of computational resources.\n\n� Limit the access of users through additional access controls enforced by the server, where more\ndetailed levels of access control are required.\n\nThe proper setting of access controls can help prevent the disclosure of sensitive or restricted information\nthat is not intended for public dissemination. In addition, access controls can be used to limit resource use\nin the event of a DoS attack against the server. Similarly, access controls can enforce separation of duty\nby ensuring server logs cannot be modified by server administrators and potentially ensure that the server\nprocess is only allowed to append to the log files.\n\nTypical files to which access should be controlled are as follows:\n\n� Application software and configuration files\n\n� Files related directly to security mechanisms:\n\n25 This deters novice attackers and some forms of malware, but it will not deter more skilled attackers from identifying the\nserver and OS type.\n26 If the organization does not already have approved standard warning banner text, work with the organization’s legal counsel\nto develop suitable banner text.\n27 Content derived from Julia Allen et al., Securing Network Servers, April 2000,\n[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim010.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### – Password hash files and other files used in authentication\n\n – Files containing authorization information used in controlling access\n\n – Cryptographic key material used in confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation services\n\n� Server log and system audit files\n\n� System software and configuration files\n\n� Server content files.\n\nIt is vital that the server application executes only under a unique individual user and group identity with\nvery restrictive access controls. New user and group identities should be established for exclusive use by\nthe server software. The new user and new group should be independent from all other users and groups\nand unique. This is a prerequisite for implementing the access controls described in the following steps.\nDuring initialization, the server may have to run with root (Unix) or administrator/system (Windows)\nprivileges; ensure that the server is configured to reduce its privileges to those of the server user after\nperforming its initialization functions.\n\nIn addition, use the server OS to limit which files can be accessed by the service processes. These\nprocesses should have read-only access to those files necessary to perform the service and should have no\naccess to other files, such as server log files. Use server host OS access controls to enforce the\nfollowing:[28]\n\n� Service processes are configured to run as a user with a strictly limited set of privileges (i.e., not\nrunning as root, administrator, or equivalent).\n\n� Service processes can only write to server content files and directories if necessary.\n\n� Temporary files created by the server software are restricted to a specified and appropriately\nprotected subdirectory (if possible). Access to these temporary files is limited to the server processes\nthat created the files (if possible).\n\nIt may also be necessary to ensure that the server software cannot save (or, in some cases, read) files\noutside the specified file structure dedicated to server content. This may be a configuration choice in the\nserver software, or it may be a choice in how the server process is controlled by the OS. Ensure that such\ndirectories and files (outside the specified directory tree) cannot be accessed both directly and through the\nserver software.\n\n**5.3** **Server Resource Constraints**\n\nTo mitigate the effects of certain types of DoS attacks, configure the server to limit the amount of OS\nresources it can consume. Some examples include—\n\n� Installing server content on a different hard drive or logical partition than the OS and server software.\n\n28 Derived from Klaus-Peter Kossakowski and Julia Allen, Securing Public Web Servers, 2000,\n[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim011.pdf. Its recommendations are specific to Web servers, but the](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/pub/documents/sims/pdf/sim011.pdf)\nsame principles apply to any type of server.\n\n\n-----\n\n� Placing a limit on the amount of hard drive space that is dedicated for uploads, if uploads to the server\nare allowed. Ideally, uploads should be placed on a separate partition to provide stronger assurance\nthat the hard drive limit cannot be exceeded.\n\n� If uploads are allowed to the server, ensuring that these files are not readable by the server until after\nsome automated or manual review process is used to screen them. This measure prevents the server\nfrom being used to propagate malware or traffic pirated software, attack tools, pornography, etc. It is\nalso possible to limit the size of each uploaded file, which could limit the potential effects of a DoS\nattack involving uploading many large files.\n\n� Ensuring that log files are stored in a location that is sized appropriately. Ideally, log files should be\nstored on a separate partition. If an attack causes the size of the log files to increase beyond\nacceptable limits, a physical partition helps ensure the server has enough resources to handle the\nsituation appropriately.\n\n� Configuring the maximum number of server processes and/or network connections that the server\nshould allow.\n\nTo some degree, these actions protect against attacks that attempt to fill the file system on the server OS\nwith extraneous and incorrect information that may cause the server to crash. Logging information\ngenerated by the server OS may help in recognizing such attacks. As discussed in Section 6.1,\nadministrators should store server logs on centralized logging servers whenever possible and also store\nlogs locally if feasible. If an attack causes the server to be compromised, the attacker could modify or\nerase locally stored logs to conceal information on the attack. Maintaining a copy of the logs on a\ncentralized logging server gives administrators more information to use when investigating such a\ncompromise.\n\nIn addition to the controls mentioned above, it is often necessary to configure timeouts and other controls\nto further reduce the impact of certain DoS attacks. One type of DoS attack takes advantage of the\npractical limits on simultaneous network connections by quickly establishing connections up to the\nmaximum permitted, such that no new legitimate users can gain access. By setting network connection\ntimeouts (the time after which an inactive connection is dropped) to a minimum acceptable time limit,\nestablished connections will time out as quickly as possible, opening up new connections to legitimate\nusers. This measure only mitigates the effects; it does not defeat the attack.\n\nIf the maximum number of open connections (or connections that are half-open—that is, the first part of\nthe TCP handshake was successful) is set to a low number, an attacker can easily consume the available\nconnections with illegitimate requests (often called a SYN flood). Setting the maximum to a much higher\nnumber may mitigate the effect of such an attack, but at the expense of consuming additional resources.\nNote that this is only an issue for servers that are not protected by a firewall that stops SYN flood attacks.\nMost enterprise-level firewalls protect servers from SYN floods by intercepting them before they reach\nthe servers.\n\n**5.4** **Selecting and Implementing Authentication and Encryption Technologies**\n\nMany servers support a range of technologies for identifying and authenticating users with differing\nprivileges for accessing information. Without user authentication, a server cannot restrict access to\nauthorized users—all services and information will be accessible by anyone with access to the server. In\nmany cases, this is not acceptable. Encryption can be used to protect information traversing the\nconnection between a server and a client. Without encryption, anyone with access to the network traffic\ncan determine, and possibly alter, the content of sensitive information, even if the user accessing the\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation has been authenticated. This may violate the confidentiality and integrity of critical\ninformation.\n\nOrganizations should periodically examine the services and information accessible on the server and\ndetermine the necessary security requirements. While doing so, the organization should identify\ninformation that shares the same security and protection requirements. For sensitive information, the\norganization should determine the users or user groups that should have access to each set of resources.\nFor information that requires some level of user authentication, the organization should determine which\nauthentication technologies or methods would provide the appropriate level of authentication and\nencryption. Each has its own unique benefits and costs that should be weighed carefully with client and\norganizational requirements and policies. It may be desirable to use some authentication methods in\ncombination. NIST SP 800-63, Electronic Authentication Guideline, contains additional information on\nauthentication mechanisms.\n\nFederal government organizations are required to use Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)validated cryptographic implementations when using cryptography to protect stored data and data\ncommunications. The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) performs validation testing of\ncryptographic modules.[29] NIST provides a list of FIPS 140 compliant[30] manufacturers and\nimplementations.[31] Additional information on encrypting communications is available from NIST SP\n800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations, NIST\nSP 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs, and NIST SP 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs.[32]\n\nOrganizations should be prepared to migrate their servers to stronger cryptographic technologies over\ntime as weaknesses are identified in the servers’ existing cryptographic technologies. For example, NIST\nhas recommended that use of the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) be phased out by 2010 in favor of\nSHA-224, SHA-256, and other larger, stronger hash functions.[33] Organizations should stay aware of\ncryptographic requirements and recommendations and plan to update their servers accordingly.\n\n29 [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/index.html](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/index.html)\n30 As of this writing, the current version of FIPS 140 is 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules\n[(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf).

Maintaining the Security of the Server\n\n\nAfter initially deploying a server, administrators need to maintain its security continuously.  This section\nprovides general recommendations for securely administering servers. Vital activities include handling\nand analyzing log files, performing regular server backups, recovering from server compromises, testing\nserver security regularly, and performing remote administration securely. As discussed in Section 4,\nsecurity configuration guides and checklists are publicly available for many OSs and server software;\nmany of these documents contain OS and server-specific recommendations for security maintenance.\nOther maintenance activities discussed in earlier sections, and thus not duplicated here, include testing\nand deploying OS and server patches and updates, maintaining the secure configuration of the OS and\nserver software, and maintaining additional security controls used for the server.[34]\n\n**6.1** **Logging**\n\nLogging is a cornerstone of a sound security posture. Capturing the correct data in the logs and then\nmonitoring those logs closely is vital.[35] Network and system logs are important, especially system logs in\nthe case of encrypted communications, where network monitoring is less effective. Server software can\nprovide additional log data relevant to server-specific events.\n\nReviewing logs is mundane and reactive, and many server administrators devote their time to performing\nduties that they consider more important or urgent. However, log files are often the only record of\nsuspicious behavior. Enabling the mechanisms to log information allows the logs to be used to detect\nfailed and successful intrusion attempts and to initiate alert mechanisms when further investigation is\nneeded. Procedures and tools need to be in place to process and analyze the log files and to review alert\nnotifications.\n\nServer logs provide—\n\n� Alerts to suspicious activities that require further investigation\n\n� Tracking of an attacker’s activities\n\n� Assistance in the recovery of the server\n\n� Assistance in post-event investigation\n\n� Required information for legal proceedings.\n\nThe selection and implementation of specific server software determines which actions the server\nadministrator should perform to establish logging configurations. Some of the information contained in\nthe steps below may not be fully applicable to all server software products.\n\n\n**6.1.1**\n\n\n**Identifying Logging Capabilities and Requirements**\n\n\nEach type of server software supports different logging capabilities. Some server software may use a\nsingle log, while other server software may use multiple logs (each for different types of records). Some\n\n34 This includes both host-based and network-based security controls. However, in many environments, network-based\nsecurity controls such as enterprise firewalls and intrusion detection systems are maintained by someone other than the\nserver administrator.\n35 For more information on logging, see NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management, which is available at\n[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nserver software permits administrators to select from multiple log formats, such as proprietary, database,\nand delimiter-separated.\n\nIf a server supports the execution of programs, scripts, or plug-ins, it may be necessary for the programs,\nscripts, or plug-ins to perform additional logging. Often, critical events take place within the application\ncode itself and will not be logged by the server. If server administrators develop or acquire application\nprograms, scripts, or plug-ins, it is strongly recommended that they define and implement a\ncomprehensive and easy-to-understand logging approach based on the logging mechanisms provided by\nthe server host OS. Log information associated with programs, scripts, and plug-ins can add significantly\nto the typical information logged by the server and may prove invaluable when investigating events.\n\nEnsuring that sufficient log capacity is available is a concern because logs often take considerably more\nspace than administrators initially estimate, especially when logging is set to a highly detailed level.\nAdministrators should closely monitor the size of the log files when they implement different logging\nsettings to ensure that the log files do not fill up the allocated storage. Because of the size of the log files,\nremoving and archiving the logs more frequently or reducing the logging level of detail may be necessary.\n\nSome server programs provide a capability to enforce or disable the checking of specified access controls\nduring program startup. This level of control may be helpful, for example, to avoid inadvertent alteration\nof log files because of errors in file access administration. Server administrators should determine the\ncircumstances under which they may wish to enable such checks (assuming the server software supports\nthis feature).\n\nAll servers should use time synchronization technologies, such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP), to\nkeep their internal clocks synchronized with an accurate time source. This provides accurate timestamps\nfor logs.\n\n**6.1.2 Reviewing and Retaining Log Files**\n\nReviewing log files is a tedious and time-consuming task that informs administrators of events that have\nalready occurred. Accordingly, files are often useful for corroborating other evidence, such as a CPU\nutilization spike or anomalous network traffic reported by an IDPS. When a log is used to corroborate\nother evidence, a focused review is in order. For example, if an IDPS reported a suspicious outbound\nFTP connection from a Web server at 8:17 a.m., then a review of the logs generated around 8:17 a.m. is\nappropriate. Server logs should also be reviewed for indications of attacks. The frequency of the reviews\ndepends on the following factors:\n\n� Amount of traffic the server receives\n\n� General threat level (certain servers receive many more attacks than other servers and thus should\nhave their logs reviewed more frequently)\n\n� Specific threats (at certain times, specific threats arise that may require more frequent log file\nanalysis)\n\n� Vulnerability of the server\n\n� Value of data and services provided by the server.\n\nReviews should take place regularly (e.g., daily) and when a suspicious activity has been noted or a threat\nwarning has been issued. Obviously, the task could quickly become burdensome to a server\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrator. To reduce this burden, automated log analysis tools have been developed (see Section\n6.1.3).\n\nIn addition, a long-term and more in-depth analysis of the logs is needed. Because a server attack can\ninvolve hundreds of unique requests, an attacker may attempt to disguise a server attack by increasing the\ninterval between requests. In this case, reviewing a single day’s or week’s logs may not show\nrecognizable trends. However, when trends are analyzed over a week, month, or quarter, multiple attacks\nfrom the same host or subnet can be more easily recognized.\n\nLog files should be protected to ensure that if an attacker does compromise a server, the log files cannot\nbe altered to cover the attack. Although encryption can be useful in protecting log files, the best solution\nis to store log files on a host separate from the server. This is often called a centralized logging server.\nCentralized logging is often performed using syslog, which is a standard logging protocol.[36] Alternately,\nsome organizations use security information and event management (SIEM) software that uses centralized\nservers to perform log analysis, database servers to store logs, and either agents installed on the individual\nhosts or processes running on the centralized servers to transfer server logs or log data from the hosts to\nthe servers and parse the logs.[37]\n\nLog files should be backed up and archived regularly. Archiving log files for a period of time is\nimportant for several reasons, including supporting certain legal actions and troubleshooting problems\nwith the server. The retention period for archived log files depends on a number of factors, including the\nfollowing:\n\n� Legal and regulatory requirements\n\n� Organizational requirements\n\n� Size of logs (which is directly related to the traffic of the site and the number of details logged)\n\n� Value of server data and services\n\n� Threat level.\n\n\n**6.1.3**\n\n\n**Automated Log File Analysis Tools**\n\n\nMany servers receive significant amounts of traffic, and the log files quickly become voluminous.\nAutomated log analysis tools should be installed to ease the burden on server administrators. These tools\nanalyze the entries in the server log files and identify suspicious and unusual activity. As mentioned in\nSection 6.1.2, some organizations use SIEM software for centralized logging, which can also perform\nautomated log file analysis. Many commercial and public domain tools are also available to support\nregular analysis of particular types of server logs.\n\nThe automated log analyzer should forward any suspicious events to the responsible server administrator\nor security incident response team as soon as possible for follow-up investigation. Some organizations\n\n36 Syslog is defined in IETF RFC 3164, The BSD Syslog Protocol, which is available at [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt.](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt)\n37 More information on syslog and SIEM implementations is provided in NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log\n_Management, which is available at_ [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nmay wish to use two or more log analyzers, which will reduce the risk of missing an attacker or other\nsignificant events in the log files.[38]\n\n**6.2** **Server Backup Procedures**\n\nOne of the most important functions of a server administrator is to maintain the integrity of the data on\nthe server. This is important because servers are often some of the most exposed and vital hosts on an\norganization’s network. The server administrator needs to perform backups of the server on a regular\nbasis for several reasons. A server could fail as a result of a malicious or unintentional act or a hardware\nor software failure. In addition, Federal agencies and many other organizations are governed by\nregulations on the backup and archiving of server data. Server data should also be backed up regularly\nfor legal and financial reasons.\n\n\n**6.2.1**\n\n\n**Server Data Backup Policies**\n\n\nAll organizations need to create a server data backup policy. Three main factors influence the contents of\nthis policy:\n\n� Legal requirements\n\n###### – Applicable laws and regulations (Federal, state, and international)\n\n – Litigation requirements\n\n� Mission requirements\n\n###### – Contractual \n\n – Accepted practices\n\n – Criticality of data to organization\n\n� Organizational guidelines and policies.\n\nAlthough each organization’s server backup policy will be different to reflect its particular environment,\nit should address the following issues:\n\n� Purpose of the policy\n\n� Parties affected by the policy\n\n� Servers covered by the policy\n\n� Definitions of key terms, especially legal and technical\n\n� Detailed requirements from the legal, business, and organization’s perspective\n\n� Required frequency of backups\n\n38 Derived from Karen Kent and Murugiah Souppaya, NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management, April\n2006, [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n� Procedures for ensuring data is properly retained and protected\n\n� Procedures for ensuring data is properly destroyed or archived when no longer required\n\n� Procedures for preserving information for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, legal\ninvestigations, and other such requests\n\n� Responsibilities of those involved in data retention, protection, and destruction activities\n\n� Retention period for each type of information logged\n\n� Specific duties of a central/organizational data backup team, if one exists.\n\n**6.2.2 Server Backup Types**\n\nThree primary types of backups exist: full, incremental, and differential. Full backups include the OS,\napplications, and data stored on the server (i.e., an image of every piece of data stored on the server hard\ndrives). The advantage of a full backup is that it is easy to restore the entire server to the state (e.g.,\nconfiguration, patch level, data) it was in when the backup was performed. The disadvantage of full\nbackups is that they take considerable time and resources to perform. Incremental backups reduce the\nimpact of backups by backing up only data that has changed since the previous backup (either full or\nincremental).\n\nDifferential backups reduce the number of backup sets that must be accessed to restore a configuration by\nbacking up all changed data since the last full backup. However, each differential backup increases as\ntime lapses from the last full backup, requiring more processing time and storage than would an\nincremental backup. Generally, full backups are performed less frequently (weekly to monthly or when a\nsignificant change occurs), and incremental or differential backups are performed more frequently (daily\nto weekly). The frequency of backups will be determined by several factors:\n\n� Volatility of information on the site\n\n###### – Static content (less frequent backups)\n\n – Dynamic content (more frequent backups)\n\n – E-commerce/e-government (very frequent backups)\n\n� Volatility of configuring the server\n\n� Type of data to be backed up (e.g., system, application, log, or user data)\n\n� Amount of data to be backed up\n\n� Backup device and media available\n\n� Time available for dumping backup data\n\n� Criticality of data\n\n� Threat level faced by the server\n\n\n-----\n\n� Effort required for data reconstruction without data backup\n\n� Other data backup or redundancy features of the server (e.g., Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks\n\n[RAID]).\n\nFor servers with highly dynamic data, standard backups may be insufficient to ensure the availability of\nthe server data. Some services have data modified on a continuous basis, and a server failure\nnecessitating restoration from a backup would cause the loss of all data changes made since the previous\nbackup. Some servers offer replication services that allow data changes from one server to be duplicated\non another server, either for individual changes or small batches of changes. Replication does place\nadditional load on servers and networks, so organizations need to weigh the costs of replication against\nthe costs of lost availability should a server failure occur. Replication is not intended to take the place of\nstandard backups, only to provide a capability to duplicate recent changes to data.\n\n\n**6.2.3**\n\n\n**Maintain a Test Server**\n\n\nMost organizations will probably wish to maintain a test or development server for their most important\nservers, at a minimum.[39] Ideally, this server should have hardware and software identical to the\nproduction or live server and be located on an internal network segment (intranet) where it can be fully\nprotected by the organization’s perimeter network defenses. Although the cost of maintaining an\nadditional server is not inconsequential, having a test server offers numerous advantages:\n\n� It provides a platform to test new patches and service packs before application on the production\nserver.\n\n� It provides a development platform for the server administrator to develop and test new content and\napplications.\n\n� It provides a platform to test configuration settings before applying them to production servers.\n\n� Software critical for development and testing but that might represent an unacceptable security risk\non the production server can be installed on the development server (e.g., software compliers,\nadministrative tool kits, remote access software).\n\n**6.3** **Recovering From a Security Compromise**\n\nMost organizations eventually face a successful compromise of one or more hosts on their network.\nOrganizations should create and document the required policies and procedures for responding to\nsuccessful intrusions.[40] The response procedures should outline the actions that are required to respond to\na successful compromise of the server and the appropriate sequence of these actions (sequence can be\ncritical). Most organizations already have a dedicated incident response team in place, which should be\ncontacted immediately when there is suspicion or confirmation of a compromise. In addition, the\n\n39 Larger organizations sometimes have several test and development servers and environments for their most critical servers\nand systems. For example, there could be a server for developer testing, another server for quality assurance testing, and\none or more externally accessible servers for testing from business partners.\n40  For more information on this area, see NIST SP 800-61 Revision 1, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, and NIST\nSP 800-18 Revision 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems\n[(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\norganization may wish to ensure that some of its staff are knowledgeable in the fields of computer and\nnetwork forensics.[41]\n\nA server administrator should follow the organization’s policies and procedures for incident handling, and\nthe incident response team should be contacted for guidance before the organization takes any action after\na suspected or confirmed security compromise. Examples of steps commonly performed after\ndiscovering a successful compromise are as follows:\n\n� Report the incident to the organization’s computer incident response capability.\n\n� Isolate the compromised systems or take other steps to contain the attack so that additional\ninformation can be collected.[42]\n\n� Consult expeditiously, as appropriate, with management, legal counsel, and law enforcement.\n\n� Investigate similar[43] hosts to determine if the attacker also has compromised other systems.\n\n� Analyze the intrusion, including—\n\n###### – The current state of the server, starting with the most ephemeral data (e.g., current network\nconnections, memory dump, files time stamps, logged in users)\n\n###### – Modifications made to the server’s software and configuration\n\n – Modifications made to the data\n\n – Tools or data left behind by the attacker\n\n – System, intrusion detection, and firewall log files.\n\n� Restore the server before redeploying it.\n\n###### – Either install a clean version of the OS, applications, necessary patches, and server content; or\nrestore the server from backups (this option can be more risky because the backups may have\nbeen made after the compromise, and restoring from a compromised backup may still allow the\nattacker access to the server).\n\n###### – Disable unnecessary services.\n\n – Apply all patches.\n\n – Change all passwords (including on uncompromised hosts, if their passwords are believed to have\nbeen seen by the compromised server, or if the same passwords are used on other hosts).\n\n41 More information on computer and network forensics is available from NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic\n_Techniques Into Incident Response_ [(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n42  Isolating the server must be accomplished with great care if the organization wishes to collect evidence. Many attackers\nconfigure compromised systems to erase evidence if a compromised system is disconnected from the network or rebooted.\nOne method to isolate a server would be to reconfigure the nearest upstream switch or router.\n43  Similar hosts would include hosts that are in the same IP address range, have the same or similar passwords, share a trust\nrelationship, and/or have the same OS and/or applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### – Reconfigure network security elements (e.g., firewall, router, IDPS) to provide additional\nprotection and notification.\n\n� Test the server to ensure security.\n\n� Reconnect the server to the network.\n\n� Monitor the server and network for signs that the attacker is attempting to access the server or\nnetwork again.\n\n� Document lessons learned.\n\nBased on the organization’s policy and procedures, system administrators should decide whether to\nreinstall the OS of a compromised server or restore it from a backup. Factors that are often considered\ninclude the following:\n\n� Level of access that the attacker gained (e.g., root, user, guest, system)\n\n� Type of attacker (internal or external)\n\n� Purpose of compromise (e.g., Web page defacement, illegal software repository, platform for other\nattacks, data exfiltration)\n\n� Method used for the server compromise\n\n� Actions of the attacker during and after the compromise (e.g., log files, intrusion detection reports)\n\n� Duration of the compromise\n\n� Extent of the compromise on the network (e.g., the number of hosts compromised)\n\n� Results of consultation with management and legal counsel.\n\nThe lower the level of access gained by the intruder and the more the server administrator understands\nabout the attacker’s actions, the less risk there is in restoring from a backup and patching the\nvulnerability. For incidents in which there is less known about the attacker’s actions and/or in which the\nattacker gains high-level access, it is recommended that the OS, server software, and other applications be\nreinstalled from the manufacturer’s original distribution media and that the server data be restored only\nfrom a known good backup.\n\nIf legal action is pursued, server administrators need to be aware of the guidelines for handling a host\nafter a compromise. Consult legal counsel and relevant law enforcement authorities as appropriate.\n\n**6.4** **Security Testing Servers**\n\nPeriodic security testing of servers is critical. Without periodic testing, there is no assurance that current\nprotective measures are working or that the security patch applied by the server administrator is\nfunctioning as advertised. Although a variety of security testing techniques exists, vulnerability scanning\nis the most common. Vulnerability scanning assists a server administrator in identifying vulnerabilities\nand verifying whether the existing security measures are effective. Penetration testing is also used, but it\n\n\n-----\n\nis used less frequently and usually only as part of an overall penetration test of the organization’s\nnetwork.[44]\n\n\n**6.4.1**\n\n\n**Vulnerability Scanning**\n\n\nVulnerability scanners are automated tools that are used to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations\nof hosts. Many vulnerability scanners also provide information about mitigating discovered\nvulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners attempt to identify vulnerabilities in the hosts scanned.\nVulnerability scanners can help identify out-of-date software versions, missing patches, or system\nupgrades, and they can validate compliance with or deviations from the organization’s security policy.\nTo accomplish this, vulnerability scanners identify OSs, server software, and other major software\napplications running on hosts and match them with known vulnerabilities in their vulnerability databases.\n\nHowever, vulnerability scanners have some significant weaknesses. Generally, they identify only surface\nvulnerabilities and are unable to address the overall risk level of a scanned server. Although the scan\nprocess itself is highly automated, vulnerability scanners can have a high false positive error rate\n(reporting vulnerabilities when none exist). Also, vulnerability scanners may not be able to recognize that\ncompensating controls are in place that mitigate a detected vulnerability. This means an individual with\nexpertise in server security and administration must interpret the results. Furthermore, vulnerability\nscanners cannot generally identify vulnerabilities in custom code or applications.\n\nVulnerability scanners rely on periodic updating of the vulnerability database to recognize the latest\nvulnerabilities. Before running any scanner, server administrators should install the latest updates to its\nvulnerability database. Some databases are updated more regularly than others (the frequency of updates\nshould be a major consideration when choosing a vulnerability scanner). Because of the potential\nnegative impact of vulnerability scanning, server administrators may wish to scan test servers first with\nnew vulnerability database updates to ascertain their impact on the servers before scanning production\nservers.\n\nVulnerability scanners are often better at detecting well-known vulnerabilities than more esoteric ones\nbecause it is impossible for any one scanning product to incorporate all known vulnerabilities in a timely\nmanner. In addition, manufacturers want to keep the speed of their scanners high (the more\nvulnerabilities detected, the more tests required, which slows the overall scanning process). Therefore,\nvulnerability scanners may be less useful to server administrators operating less popular servers, OSs, or\ncustom-coded applications.\n\nVulnerability scanners provide the following capabilities:\n\n� Identifying active hosts on a network\n\n� Identifying active services (ports) on hosts and which of these are vulnerable\n\n� Identifying applications and banner grabbing\n\n� Identifying OSs\n\n� Identifying vulnerabilities associated with discovered OSs, server software, and other applications\n\n� Testing compliance with host application usage/security policies.\n\n44 For information about other testing techniques, see NIST SP 800-115 (Draft), Technical Guide to Information Security\n_[Testing (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)_\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations should conduct vulnerability scanning to validate that OSs and server software are up-todate on security patches and software versions. Vulnerability scanning is a labor-intensive activity that\nrequires a high degree of human involvement to interpret the results. It may also be disruptive to\noperations by taking up network bandwidth, slowing network response times, and potentially affecting the\navailability of the scanned server or its applications. However, vulnerability scanning is extremely\nimportant for ensuring that vulnerabilities are mitigated as soon as possible, before they are discovered\nand exploited by adversaries. Vulnerability scanning should be conducted on a weekly to monthly basis.\nMany organizations also run a vulnerability scan whenever a new vulnerability database is released for\nthe organization’s scanner application. Vulnerability scanning results should be documented and\ndiscovered deficiencies should be corrected.\n\nOrganizations should also consider running more than one vulnerability scanner. As previously\ndiscussed, no scanner is able to detect all known vulnerabilities; however, using two scanners generally\nincreases the number of vulnerabilities detected. A common practice is to use one commercial and one\nfreeware scanner. Network-based and host-based vulnerability scanners are available for free or for a fee.\n\n\n**6.4.2**\n\n\n**Penetration Testing**\n\n\nPenetration testing is “security testing in which evaluators attempt to circumvent the security features of a\nsystem based on their understanding of the system design and implementation”.[45] The purpose of\npenetration testing is to exercise system protections (particularly human response to attack indications) by\nusing common tools and techniques developed by attackers. This testing is highly recommended for\ncomplex or critical servers.\n\nPenetration testing can be an invaluable technique to any organization's information security program.\nHowever, it is a very labor-intensive activity and requires great expertise to minimize the risk to targeted\nsystems. At a minimum, it may slow the organization's network response time because of network\nmapping and vulnerability scanning. Furthermore, the possibility exists that systems may be damaged or\nrendered inoperable in the course of penetration testing. Although this risk is mitigated by the use of\nexperienced penetration testers, it can never be fully eliminated.\n\nPenetration testing does offer the following benefits:[46]\n\n� Tests the network using the same methodologies and tools employed by attackers\n\n� Verifies whether vulnerabilities exist\n\n� Goes beyond surface vulnerabilities and demonstrates how these vulnerabilities can be exploited\niteratively to gain greater access\n\n� Demonstrates that vulnerabilities are not purely theoretical\n\n� Provides the “realism” necessary to address security issues\n\n� Allows for testing of procedures and susceptibility of the human element to social engineering.\n\n45 Definition from Committee on National Security Systems, National Information Assurance (IA) Glossary, CNSS Instruction\nNo. 4009, June 2006\n46 Derived from John Wack et al., NIST SP 800-42, Guideline on Network Security Testing, February 2002,\n[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n**6.5** **Remotely Administering a Server**\n\nRemote administration of a server should be allowed only after careful consideration of the risks. The\nrisk of enabling remote administration varies considerably depending on the location of the server on the\nnetwork. For a server that is located behind a firewall, remote administration can be implemented\nrelatively securely from the internal network, but not without added risk. Remote administration should\ngenerally not be allowed from a host located outside the organization’s network unless it is performed\nfrom an organization-controlled computer through the organization’s remote access solution, such as a\nVPN.\n\nIf an organization determines that it is necessary to remotely administer a server, following these steps\nshould ensure that remote administration is implemented in as secure a manner as possible:\n\n� Use a strong authentication mechanism (e.g., public/private key pair, two-factor authentication).\n\n� Restrict which hosts can be used to remotely administer the server.\n\n###### – Restrict by authorized users\n\n – Restrict by IP address (not hostname)\n\n – Restrict to hosts on the internal network or those using the organization’s enterprise remote\naccess solution.\n\n� Use secure protocols that can provide encryption of both passwords and data (e.g., SSH, HTTPS); do\nnot use less secure protocols (e.g., telnet, FTP, NFS, HTTP) unless absolutely required and tunneled\nover an encrypted protocol, such as SSH, SSL, or IPsec.\n\n� Enforce the concept of least privilege on remote administration (e.g., attempt to minimize the access\nrights for the remote administration accounts).\n\n� Do not allow remote administration from the Internet through the firewall unless accomplished via\nstrong mechanisms, such as VPNs.\n\n� Use remote administration protocols that support server authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle\nattacks.\n\n� Change any default accounts or passwords for the remote administration utility or application.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Appendix A—Glossary**\n\n\nSelected terms used in the publication are defined below.\n\n**Availability: Ensuring that information is accessible by authorized
