    "plain_text": "# From Dawn to \"Silent Night\": \"DarkSide Ransomware\" Initial Attack Vector Evolution\n\n**[advanced-intel.com/post/from-dawn-to-silent-night-darkside-ransomware-initial-attack-vector-evolution](https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/from-dawn-to-silent-night-darkside-ransomware-initial-attack-vector-evolution)**\n\nMay 14, 2021\n\nMay 14, 2021\n\n5 min read\n\n**_Disclaimer: This is a redacted excerpt of the report published by the subject matter_**\n**_expert team at Advanced Intelligence for the flagship product “Andariel”._**\n\n_DarkSide's affiliate group ascension to the top of the cybercrime food chain was determined_\n_by DarkSide's ability to build its initial attack arsenal, which included RDPs, infrastructural_\n_vulnerabilities, and, most importantly, a liaison with the Zloader aka \"Silent Night\" botnet sub-_\n\n\n-----\n\n_group operation._\n\nDarkSide positioned itself as a unique group from the very beginning. Ironically, they started\nwith a promise that they will not target healthcare and critical infrastructure. While many\nother ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate groups preferred to target corporate networks\nwith hopes of spotting vulnerable networks massively, DarkSide deliberately focused on\nlong-planned attacks that took persistence and sophistication.\n\nMoreover, based on multiple forensics and tailored intelligence matters, AdvIntel determined\nthat the group diversified the initial attack points used during attacks according to our threat\nprevention product \"Andariel.\"\n\nThis discovery and investigation were significant as we identified three crucial patterns for\nthe DarkSide operation against the manufacturing, logistics, and infrastructure industry:\n\n**Use of supply-chain attacks**\n\n**Use of multiple attack vectors**\n\n**Alliance with Zloader aka “Silent Night” botnet group**\n\n**Evolution of DarkSide Methods**\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the beginning of April, AdvIntel investigated a DarkSide breach of a major North American\nretailer. DarkSide was consistent in their victimology - the retailer network connected\nhardware producers and manufacturers. The data dumped by the DarkSide on the website\nincluded valuable corporate information likely extracted from the admin domain or other joint\nnetwork that connects all the branches.\n\n**1. Supply-Chain Attack**\n\nA supply-chain cyber-attack unites the seemingly ununitable - massive scale-based\nautomated dissemination of ransomware and selectively targeted attacks requiring the\npersistent presence and protracted recognizance. Such a combination turns an already\nviable attack methodology into a far-more perilous attack foundation. At the same time, the\naffiliates of elite ransomware syndicates are keeping a close eye on the vulnerable periphery\nof larger targets to initiate an APT-style joint operation against a defense contractor, an\ninvestment fund, or, in this case - a major retailer.\n\n**2. Further Advancement - Multi-Vector Attack**\n\nHowever, utilization of the supply-chain attack methodology was not the only findings we\nhad. Upon defining the likely attack strategy employed in the case, AdvIntel reconstructed\nthe attack approach. For this purpose, we have performed a vulnerability analysis for the\ninitial attack points using our unique visibility into the adversarial datasets. Three types of\npotential initial points were found for the victim's domains within the timing that matched\nDarkSide's TTPs and the attack timelines - exposed Microsoft Exchange Server endpoints,\nbotnet infection indicators, Palo Alto vulnerability CVE indicators.\n\nThe methodology of exploiting Palo Alto CVE vulnerability by ransomware groups may be\nsimilar to the ones practiced by them against Pulse VPN and Fortigate endpoints. The\nexploitation of such CVEs implies remote code execution (as in the case of Palo Alto CVE2019-1579), privilege elevation, or credential-stealing. The exposure remained present the\nday when the files of the victim were dumped. One of the possible scenarios is that the\nvulnerability was used at the final step of the attack, before the payload deployment. It is\npossible that DarkSide engaged in a multi-vector attack in which different initial attack points\nwere used for various purposes - CVEs for maintaining persistence and/or auxiliary network\ninvestigations and access privilege elevation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3. Peak - Zloader aka “Silent Night” Botnet**\n\nHowever, the most valuable finding was that we detected Zloader infection in relation to the\nvictim's domain, prior to the attack. Zloader - a prolific botnet also known as “Silent Night”\nimmediately became our primary investigation vector.\n\nThis was not the first time when we investigated a “Zloader-DarkSide” deployment. In the\nweek of February 22, 2021, AdvIntel identified and reported a Zloader botnet infection of one\nof the largest insurance brokerages in the United States. The botnet operators noted host\ncount, indicating that they had access to that many devices in the company network. In\nMarch 2021, the offering of the victim's data appeared on the \"name-and-shame\" blog of\nDarkSide.\n\nAccording to AdvIntel's advanced HUMINT operations, the Zloader operators classified the\naccess as the one that can be developed for a re-sell or share with ransomware collective\nand for the further attack conducted via a ransomware payload deployment orchestrated\nthrough the Zloader-established intrusion.\n\nNot only is this botnet known for being one of the main attack vectors for DarkSide and\nworking in a liaison with this group, but the infection present on the victim's domain may have\nsupported the initial version with a supply-chain attack. This domain identified in relation to\nZloader infection was likely related to a vendor, customer, third-party, or peripheral domain\nthrough which the initial attack began with DarkSide meticulously paving its way to a core\ndomain.\n\nTherefore, considering the timing and the indicators, Zloader infection of a peripheral domain\neventually led to a core domain intrusion by DarkSide. The syndicate may have used the\ninformation, credentials, and system info collected by Zloader for conscience and intel\npurposes, and/or they may have used Zloader as a payload dropper.\n\n**The Finale - Colonial Pipeline**\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 8, 2021, top U.S. fuel pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline shut its entire network, the\nsource of nearly half of the U.S. East Coast's fuel supply, after a cyberattack that industry\nsources said was caused by ransomware.\n\nThis attack included all of the methods which were signatures for DarkSide. For instance multiple attack vectors. AdvIntel has identified an adversarially-targeted Microsoft Exchange\nserver exposure for March 21, 2021.\n\nMoreover, AdvIntel identified that Colonial Pipeline has been targeted by botnets in 2020.\n\nOn May 10, 2021, the US Federal Government confirmed that the ransomware variant\nDarkside had infected a critical infrastructure company in the United States, namely, the\ndisruption of the operations of the Colonial Pipeline.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe DarkSide group attempted to become a new step in ransomware development. In order\nto decrease the attention to the RaaS business created by REvil, they chose to use a more\nquiet and diligent approach to attacks relying on long-term recognizance, supply chain\ninfiltrations, and the use of Zloader malware for recon and delivery. Ironically, this approach\nled to an opposite result - ideas that were brought to rejuvenile the ransomware game,\ninstead of culminating into the Colonial Pipeline incident with detrimental consequences to all\nRaaS groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is still unclear what was happening behind the scenes when the Colonial Pipeline attack\nwas in development. A possible scenario is that the affiliate(s) who were responsible for the\nmalware operation liaison - a critical link in the entire Colonial Pipeline attack, started to act\nindependently, understanding the power and capabilities they possessed by the DarkSideZloader liaison. This can lead to further negative dynamics, as even after the ransomware\ngroup declared a shutdown, the partnerships built with Zloader will not vanish.\n\nThe criminal alliance which resulted in the significant cyberattacks in the last decade is\npowerful and successful to simply vanish into the darkness without an international takedown\nor criminal arrest.\n\n\n-----",
