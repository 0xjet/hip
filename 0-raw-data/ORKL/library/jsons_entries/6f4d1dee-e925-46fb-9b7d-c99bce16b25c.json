Public research has noted several Chinese APT groups adopting\nCOVID-19 phishing lures in recent months to carry out espionage campaigns against\nestablished and expanding target sets. In March 2020, Proofpoint researchers observed a\nphishing campaign impersonating the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance on\nCOVID-19 critical preparedness to deliver a new malware family that researchers have\ndubbed “Sepulcher”. This campaign targeted European diplomatic and legislative bodies,\nnon-profit policy research organizations, and global organizations dealing with economic\naffairs. Additionally, a sender email identified in this campaign has been linked to\nhistoric Chinese APT targeting of the international Tibetan community using payloads\nlinked to LuckyCat malware. Subsequently, a phishing campaign from July 2020\ntargeting Tibetan dissidents was identified delivering the same strain of Sepulcher\nmalware. Operator email accounts identified in this campaign have been publicly linked\nto historic Chinese APT campaigns targeting the Tibetan community delivering ExileRAT\nmalware. Based on the use of publicly known sender addresses associated with Tibetan\ndissident targeting and the delivery of Sepulcher malware payloads, Proofpoint\nresearchers have attributed both campaigns to the APT actor TA413, which has previously\nbeen documented in association with ExileRAT. The usage of publicly known Tibetanthemed sender accounts to deliver Sepulcher malware demonstrates a short-term\nrealignment of TA413’s targets of interest. While best known for their campaigns against\nthe Tibetan diaspora, this APT group associated with the Chinese state interest prioritized\nintelligence collection around Western economies reeling from COVID-19 in March 2020\nbefore resuming more conventional targeting later this year.\n\n**Delivery and Exploitation**\n\nIn the latter half of March 2020, researchers identified a malicious email sent to\nnumerous entities involved with economic policy and forecasting within Europe. The\nemails contained a weaponized RTF attachment that impersonated the WHO’s “Critical\n\n\n-----\n\npreparedness, readiness and response actions for COVID-19, Interim guidance”\ndocument. This guidance was initially published on March 7, 2020, while the weaponized\nattachment was delivered by threat actors on March 16, 2020. When the malicious RTF\nattachment named “Covdi.rtf” is executed, it exploits a Microsoft Equation Editor\nvulnerability and installs an embedded malicious RTF object in the form of a Windows\nmeta-file (WMF) to the file directory %\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\wd4sx.wmf. This method\nis used by a known variant of the Royal Road RTF weaponizer which is shared among\nnumerous Chinese APT actors. The execution of the WMF file ultimately results in the\ndelivery and installation of the previously unidentified Sepulcher malware.\n\n_Figure 1: Malicious Email from March 2020 “Country & Technical Guidance –_\n_Coronavirus disease...”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Lure Document impersonating WHO guidance on COVID-19._\n\nThe emails in this campaign originated from the Yahoo free-mail sender address\n[tseringkanyaq@yahoo[.]com. This sender account was first written about in a joint report](https://targetedthreats.net/media/2-Extended%20Analysis-Full.pdf)\nby Citizen Lab, the Munk School of Global Affairs, and the University of Toronto in 2013,\nwhich described Chinese APT activity. The report indicated this email address had been\nused in phishing campaigns from May 2012 through June 2013 to target Tibetan\nmembers of civil society. Specifically, the sender address is thought to impersonate\nKanyag Tsering, a Tibetan monk and activist that held a high profile in the media during\nthe historic campaign time period. The email address delivered malicious attachments\nthat installed ShadowNet, Duojeen, and PubSab (OS X) malware. The report goes on to\nnote that these malware payloads were found to share infrastructure with LuckyCat\n[malware that was identified by TrendMicro also being deployed against Tibetan targets in](https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_luckycat_redux.pdf)\n2012. LuckyCat malware was more recently linked to Chinese APT malware targeting the\n[international Tibetan community via an APK variant reported by Talos Intelligence in](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/02/exilerat-shares-c2-with-luckycat.html)\nJanuary 2019. The LuckyCat Android RAT utilized in early 2019 used the same\ninfrastructure as ExileRAT payloads to target members of a Central Tibetan\nAdministration mailing list.\n\nFollowing the Sepulcher malware campaign in March 2020, a subsequent malicious email\ncampaign delivering this malware was identified on July 27, 2020. The email included a\nmalicious PowerPoint (PPSX) attachment conspicuously named “TIBETANS BEING HIT\nBY DEADLY VIRUS THAT CARRIES A GUN AND SPEAKS CHINESE.ppsx”. The SMTP\nheader From field impersonated the “Women's Association Tibetan,\" while the\nattachment, once opened, referenced “Tibet, Activism and Information”. When the\nPowerPoint attachment is executed, it calls out to the IP 118.99.13[.]4 to download a\nSepulcher malware payload named “file.dll”. Additionally, the distinct C2 request\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://118.99.13[.]4:1234/qqqzqa that occurs at that time has been seen previously in\nassociation with TA413 malware campaigns. Upon the delivery of the payload “file.dll” it\nis saved as “credential.dll” and executed resulting in a C2 communication with the\ndomain Dalailamatrustindia.ddns[.]net. The attachment title, decoy content,\n[impersonated sender, and Dalai Lama Trust in India-themed C2 affirms this campaign’s](http://dalailamatrustindia.org/about-us/)\nfocus on individuals associated with the Tibetan Leadership in Exile.\n\n_Figure 3: Lure Document TIBETANS BEING HIT BY DEADLY VIRUS THAT CARRIES A_\nGUN AND SPEAKS CHINESE.ppsx.\n\nThis Sepulcher malware campaign is highly reminiscent of the January 2019 campaign\n[that utilized PPSX attachments to deliver ExileRAT malware, previously documented by](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/02/exilerat-shares-c2-with-luckycat.html)\nTalos Intelligence. The foremost commonality between these campaigns, apart from the\nattachment type and content of the PowerPoint, is the sender email\n“mediabureauin@gmail[.]com\" which was shared in both the historic ExileRat campaign\nand the recent Sepulcher malware campaign from 2020. The intermittent use of a single\nemail address in multiple APT campaigns spanning nearly eight years is uncommon in\ncyber threat research. While it is not impossible for multiple APT groups to utilize a single\noperator account (sender address) against distinct targets in different campaigns, it is\nunlikely. It is further unlikely that this sender reuse after several years would occur twice\nin a four-month period between March and July, with both instances delivering the same\nSepulcher malware family. The sharing of delivery/hosting infrastructure, malware\npayloads, or post-exploitation tools have been observed across Chinese APT groups and\n\n\n-----\n\ncan be considered more common. However, the use of operator accounts spanning\nmultiple APT campaigns is much less common. It is less advantageous to share operator\naccounts as the creation of new free-mail accounts for phishing delivery is trivial and does\nnot represent a cost barrier to operation. Additionally, it increases the likelihood of\ndetection by targeted organizations. Although the re-emergence of two publicly known\nsender accounts after multiple years is unusual, the use of a known sender account to\ntarget a new group of recipients in this case may represent an opsec failure resulting from\na broader re-tasking of existing APT threat actors in response to an unprecedented global\ncrisis.\n\n**Sepulcher Malware**\n\nThe Sepulcher malware payload (SHA256:\n4a4a959aef64ea48e2b831468119180d0af4b5b685c35170f5db3f001b9cc319) observed in\nthe March 2020 campaign targeting European economic targets was analyzed for this\npublication. The file “wd4sx.wmf” is installed by the initial RTF attachment upon\nexecution and contains the final Sepulcher malware payload and a payload dropper.\nSepulcher is a basic RAT payload that can gather intelligence on the resources of the\ninfected system, spawn a reverse CMD shell, and read from and write to file.\n\nInitially, the WMF file installs a temporary file named “OSEB979.tmp” to the Windows\ntemporary directory that serves as a payload dropper. It installs the final Sepulcher\npayload “credential.dll” to the directory %AppData%\\Roaming\\Identities\\Credential.dll.\nIt then creates a scheduled task named “lemp” which uses rundll32.exe to run the\nSepulcher payload and call the export function “GetObjectCount” on an hourly basis. This\nscheduled task serves as a persistence mechanism for Sepulcher malware.\n\n**schtasks /create /tr \"rundll32.exe %APPDATA%\\Identities\\Credential.dll,GetOb-**\n**jectCount\" /tn \"lemp\" /sc HOURLY**\n\n_Figure 4: Scheduled task and persistence mechanism for executing Sepulcher payload._\n\nThe Sepulcher configuration is stored in the registry under the Registry Key\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\WAB\\Resources. It contains four distinct\nkeys named “DefaultString”, “Credentials”, “Security”, and “Property”. The\n“DefaultString” is randomly generated by CoCreatGuid() with the initial formatting done\nby the multibyte _sprintf_(). This is then stored in the registry by RegSetValueExW()\nwhich uses the wide character type. This results in a broken encoding that renders as\nChinese characters. This should not be interpreted as an indication that the threat actor is\nusing Chinese characters in the malware configuration, despite broader attribution\npointing to Chinese state associated actors. The remaining three keys “Credentials”,\n“Security”, and “Property” represent the three C2 servers in encrypted format that are\nutilized by the malware. The below algorithm is used to decrypt the C2 servers which, in\nthis sample, are revealed to be the IP address 107.151.194[.]197 utilizing ports 80, 443,\n\n\n-----\n\nand 8080. Notably, this IP address hosted a single domain welfaretibet[.]tk as of April 5,\n2020. This suggests that threat actors did not establish standalone network infrastructure\nfor targeting European economic entities and intended to utilize this IP to persist in\ntargeting entities related to Tibetan matters in the future.\n\nDecrypted C2 IP Addresses:\n\n107.151.194[.]197:80\n107.151.194[.]197:443\n107.151.194[.]197:8080\n\n_Figure 5: Sepulcher malware configuration._\n\n_Figure 6: Sepulcher malware C2 decryption algorithm._\n\nSepulcher malware has seven work modes that include conducting reconnaissance on an\ninfected host, spawning a reverse command shell, reading from file, and writing to file.\nMore granularly, additional commands exist within the intelligence\ngathering/reconnaissance work modes (1002, 1003, 1004) which carry out\n\n\n-----\n\nreconnaissance functionality within the infected host. These commands include obtaining\ninformation about the drives, file information, directory statistics, directory paths,\ndirectory content, running processes, and services. Additionally, it is capable of more\nactive functionalities like deleting directories and files, creating directories, moving file\nsource to destination, spawning a shell to execute commands, terminating a process,\nrestarting a service, changing a service start type, and deleting a service.\n\n**Mode** **Functionality**\n\n1005 Reverse command shell\n\n1006 Read from File\n\n1009 Do nothing /PONG\n\n1919 Write to File\n\n\n1002\n\n1003\n\n1004\n\n\nSystem intelligence gathering/reconnaissance functionalities\n\n\n_Figure 7: Sepulcher malware work modes (commands)._\n\n\n**Com-**\n**mand**\n\n\n**COM-**\n**MAND_DA-**\n**TA.data**\n\n\n**Functionality**\n\n\n6001 Drive letter Get drive information: sizes, type, path, etc.\n\n6002 File path Get file information in a WIN32_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DATA\nstructure.\n\n\n6003 Directory\npath\n\n6004 Directory\npath\n\n\nGet directory statistics: number of files, sub directories and total size.\n\nGet directory content information: WIN32_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DATA and dir/file name.\n\n\n-----\n\n6005 N/A Delete directory / file and empty the recycle bin.\n\n\n6006 Directory\nname\n\n6007 Src file path,\nDst file path\n\n\nCreate directory.\n\nMove file Source to Destination.\n\n\n6008 N/A Get all drives information: sizes, types, path, etc.\n\n\n6009 Command\nstring\n\n\nShell execute command.\n\n\n6010 PID string Terminate process.\n\n6017 N/A Get directory content detailed information: WIN32_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DATA and dir/file name for each dir/file inside\n\n6018 N/A Get list of running processes.\n\n6019 N/A Get list of services.\n\n6020 N/A Restart service.\n\n6021 N/A Change service start type.\n\n6023 N/A Delete service.\n\n_Figure 8: Sepulcher intelligence gathering/reconnaissance commands._\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nThe malware receives commands including various mode commands and sub-commands\nvia the C2 addresses decrypted from the malware’s configuration. The initial\ncommunication is initiated by the client via a single byte XOR encrypted handshake\npacket and completed via a server-to-client packet that is not encrypted. The\ncommunication then continues with a single byte XOR encrypted client-to-server\nPACKET_HELLO that specifies the malware command mode. In the case of modes 1002,\n1003, and 1004, which are the commands that initialize the intelligence\ngathering/reconnaissance capabilities of the malware, the server replays the\nPACKET_HELLO with mode commands in the initial PACKET_HANDSHAKE via a\n\n\n-----\n\nPACKET_COMMAND. The same method of C2 communication was observed for\nSepulcher sub-commands, however, the format of observed sub-commands delivered via\nthe “COMMAND_DATA” field varied depending on content of the PACKET_COMMAND.\nOnce a PACKET_COMMAND is received, the result is stored in a %TEMP% file on the\nhost. Finally, that result is exfiltrated to the C2 server using the above described\nPACKET_COMMAND method.\n\n_Figure 9: Sepulcher C2 PACKET_HELLO delivering malware mode command._\n\n_Figure 10: Sepulcher C2 PACKET_COMMAND to replay initial packet with mode_\n_command._\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe adoption of COVID-19 lures by Chinese APT groups in espionage campaigns was a\ngrowing trend in the threat landscape during the first half of 2020. This was thought to be\neffective decoy fodder by threat actors as was observed in the WHO content that was\ncoopted as part of the TA413 March 2020 campaign targeting European economic\nentities. However, following an initial urgency in intelligence collection around the health\nof western global economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a return to normalcy\nwas observed in both the targets and decoy content of TA413 campaigns. While the new\nSepulcher malware is far from groundbreaking, its combination with timely social\nengineering lures masquerading as critical guidance from the WHO leveraged an urgent\nglobal crisis to entice victims. This campaign’s specific focus on European economic,\ndiplomatic, and legislative entities belies a possible momentary realignment for Chinese\ncyber espionage groups to collect information on global economies cast into upheaval as a\nresult of COVID-19. However, in the case of TA413 that shift may have been short lived.\nThe re-emergence of well-known Tibetan themed sender addresses and graphically\n\n\n-----\n\ndidactic PowerPoint attachments in later July again tie TA413 to its emblematic targeting\nof the Tibetan community. Despite the recurring use of publicly disclosed email\naddresses, a pedestrian RAT, and the recycling of delivery methods observed over a year\nago, the targeting shift between these two campaigns paint a conspicuously contemporary\nportrait of a rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape in 2020.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n4a4a959aef64ea48e2b831468119180d0af4b5b685c35170f5d\nb3f001b9cc319\n\nf6f9224c389ee46b28fe04847de4afb1e33\nca03763c9e5c41bc61a29eab7f669\n\n\nSHA256 Credential.dll\n\nSepulcher Malware\n\nMarch 2020\n\nSHA256 OSEC234.tmp\n\nSepulcher Malware Dro\n\nMarch 2020\n\n\ntseringkanyaq@yahoo[.]com Email\nAddress\n\n\nSender Address First O\n\nserved 2013\n\n\n107.151.194[.]197 IP Command & Control\n\nwelfaretibet[.]tk Domain Domain Related by I\n\nMarch 2020\n\n\nmediabureauin@gmail[.]com Email\nAddress\n\n\nSender Address First O\n\nserved 2019\n\n\nff301b3295959a3ac5f3d0a5ea0d9f0aedcd8\nda7c4207b18f4bbb6ddaa0cdf22\n\n\nSHA256 PowerPoint Attachme\n\nTIBETANS BEING HIT\nDEADLY VIRUS THAT C\n\nRIES A GUN AND SPE\n\nCHINESE.ppsx\n\n\n118.99.13[.]4 IP Malware Delivery IP\n\nhxxp://118.99.13[.]4:1234/qqqzqa URL URL\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 Communication\n\nhxxp://118.99.13[.]4:8099/file.dll URL URL Delivery Resour\n\nSepulcher Malware\n\n\ne89614e3b0430d706bef2d1f13b30b43e5c53d\nb9a477e2ff60ef5464e1e9add4\n\n\nSHA256 File.dll | Credential.d\n\nSepulcher Malware\n\nJuly 2020\n\n\nDalailamatrustindia.ddns[.]net Domain Command & Control Do\n\n115.126.6[.]16 IP Hosting IP\nDalailamatrustindia.ddns\n\n[© 2020.
