Included in this report is\nthe mention of a proxy tool that the group uses to route traffic to and from devices on an\ninfected network that are normally isolated from the Internet.\n\nAlthough the tool is simple (and in development), it has not yet been well-documented in the\npublic space. This may partly be because the tool is relatively rare: Group-IB describes\nSilence as a small group performing a limited set of activities. For researchers to obtain a\ncopy, the Silence proxy would have to be deployed post-compromise, identified during\nincident response, and uploaded online. Given the rarity, some notes on the .NET version of\nthis tool are below as a reference to future analysts.\nTechnical Details\n\nFiles examined:\n\n50565c4b80f41d2e7eb989cd24082aab (New)\n\n8191dae4bdeda349bda38fd5791cb66f (Old)\n\nThe Silence proxy is written in .NET and known versions are packed with SmartAssembly.\n[This can be unpacked automatically using a tool such as De4Dot to facilitate static analysis;](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot)\n[however, this can lead to issues during debugging (with a tool such as DnSpy) that prevent](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy)\nthe malware from properly executing. In the two known samples, the malware’s source code\nis readable even without this step.\n\nThe Silence proxy performs four basic tasks:\n\n1) The malware reads and parses its configuration\n\n2) The malware enters a switch/case statement based on a configuration value\n\n3) The malware opens a connection to a specified C2, the type of which depends on task 2\n\n4) (Optional) The malware can perform status logging (to a local location that varies by\nsample)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Silence proxy configuration (right click, open in new tab)\n\nIn the sample analyzed, the configuration specifies the following:\n\nBackConnectServerIP – C2 server IP\n\nBackConnectServerPort – C2 server port\n\nConfiguredAs – Type of connection (used in the Case/Switch statement)\n\nDomainName – Used for NtlmAuth case\n\nPortToListen – Listening port\n\nProxyIP – Endpoint IP\n\nProxyPort – Endpoint Port\n\nUserName – Used for authentication cases\n\nUserPassword – Used for authentication cases\n\nFrom here, the tool passes the ConfiguredAs value into a Case/Switch statement that\ndetermines what type of connection to open. This routine is not fully implemented, and thus\nserves as an excellent example for malware that is “under development.” The first image\nbelow shows a portion of the Case/Switch statement with several cases that have not yet\nbeen populated with code. The second image below is from a “newer” sample. While there is\nstill an empty case, the ProxyBackConnector case has been filled in.\n\n\n-----\n\nOlder sample with ProxyBackConnector not populated\n\n“Newer” sample with ProxyBackConnector implemented\n\n\n-----\n\nIn total, the tool supports (or likely will support) the following cases, which represent the\nfunctionality of the malware:\n\nSocksServer – Act as a listener for network traffic\nDirectBackConnector – Open a connection to a specified IP and accept the response\nProxyBackConnector – Open a connection to a specified IP and route the response to\nanother device\nProxyBackConnectorWithAuth- Not implemented, likely intended as proxy + regular (nondomain) credentials\nProxyBackConnectorWithNtlmAuth – Proxy with an implementation to pass domain\ncredentials\n\nAs mentioned at the start of the post, this is not a complex tool. Despite this, its appearance\non the network should be cause for concern, as it is indicative of an adversary that is\nattempting to route traffic to and from a specific isolated device.\n\n\n-----",
