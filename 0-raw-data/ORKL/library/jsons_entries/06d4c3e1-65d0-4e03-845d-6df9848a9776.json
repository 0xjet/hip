The distribution pages are exposed at the top of the search result\npage of search engines such as Google, so the risk of infection is high, and the number of\nrelevant detection cases is also relatively high. The ASEC analysis team had thus advised\nusers on these relevant threats in the previous blog posts.\n\nCryptBot is one of the most actively-changing malware with its distribution pages constantly\nbeing newly-created. This blog will explain the details of the recently modified version of the\nCryptBot that is currently being distributed.\n\nWhen the user clicks the download button in a post disguised as a cracks and tools sharing\nwebsite created by the attacker, the user is redirected multiple times, ultimately redirected to\nthe distribution page, and new types of such redirections are constantly being created. The\nfigure below shows relatively newly-created distribution pages.\n\nFigure 1. Examples of web pages distributing malware\nNot only are the distribution pages changing, but the CryptBot itself is also actively changing,\nand a new version with a large-scale modification is recently being distributed. Compared to\nthe previous version, a few of the additional features were deleted for simplification, and the\ninfostealing code was modified to adapt to the new browser environment.\n\nFirst, a few of the distinctive features of the CryptBot were deleted. The anti-sandbox routine,\nwhich terminates without malicious behavior in the case of ‘Xeon’ environment after checking\nthe CPU name set as the infection target, was removed. The anti-VM routine that checks the\nnumber of CPU cores and memory remains the same.\n\nThe behavior that saves the stolen information to two different folders and sends each folder\nto different C2 was also deleted. This means that in the previous version, there were two\ninfostealing C2s and one C2 for downloading additional malware, but in the currently\n\n\n-----\n\ndistributed version, there is only one infostealing C2.\n\nFigure\n\n2. Comparing C2 transmission of previous CryptBot (top) and modified CryptBot (bottom)\nThe code shows that when sending files, the method of manually adding the sent file data to\nthe header was changed to the method that uses simple API. user-agent value when\nsending was also modified. The previous version calls the function twice to send each to a\ndifferent C2, but in the changed version, one C2 URL is hard-coded in the function.\n\nFigure 3. Comparing the C2 transmission code of the previous CryptBot (top) and the\nmodified CryptBot (bottom)\nThe infostealing features of collecting TXT files on the desktop and screenshots of the\nscreen were also deleted. The behavior of self-deletion that was performed when it was\ndetected by an anti-VM routine or when it completed all malicious behavior and was\nterminated was also deleted.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Comparing the main routine function of the previous CryptBot (left) and the\nmodified CryptBot (right)\nNot only were the features deleted, but there were also feature improvement patches. The\nprevious version of CryptBot used the pathname of the old version of Chrome when stealing\nChrome browser information, so it could not steal information from Chrome v96 released in\nNovember 2021 and its later versions. The recently modified sample includes all the newest\nChrome path names.\n\nThe previous version of CryptBot code was structured in a way that if at least one piece of\ndata did not exist out of the list of target data for stealing, the infostealing behavior would fail.\nSo, infostealing was successful only when the infected system used Chrome browser v81 –\nv95. The recently improved code can steal if the target data exists regardless of the version.\n\nFigure 5. Comparing the pathname of the target information for stealing of the previous\nCryptBot (left) and the modified CryptBot (right)\nThe creator had thus applied a feature improvement patch for the malicious behavior and\nalso removed many unnecessary features. As CryptBot’s packing method, internal codes,\nC2, etc. actively change, and as its distribution pages are easily exposed, user caution is\nadvised.\n\nThe following is the IOC information of CryptBot that has been distributed over the past\nweek.\n\n[IOC Info]\n\nMD5\n\n\n-----\n\n28e1397f9233badf815e22ef2e13634f\n33e6e82f629715ce89424c41a847e889\n\n0ceba86a7ab680d71f3dc99bbbec3368\n\n74829260d3acddf20a4cc250e24e4d5e\n\nd02b62d008db43c824966101345d65a4\n\nffe738f3cd8b8dc7e698fb3ded271d98\n\n8f3c845153fe6e83d47b747881588c72\n\n0169a24e049b4a8737256f06a7b666d2\n\n98a86c1d2ffd2ebf30e0cc36efa8aef9\n\nc2c2ced2d3319f3e89e546c7e96da4f9\n\n599d2007777226487a4eb01cef954f99\n\nf3ab03c11b45d48d8efd4206b1d17ccd\n\n7c942ca86fa10d68691df2c13f8b2467\n\n3d83e57852c8e379345a8c34ad2a14c9\n\n2a05717d483b3a8829a50cd977967040\n\n31a6aeffae90556406e82c18abaddd65\n\ncb0eef45148b712e666df23d0015aa82\n\nd6227c96b116293d2d08f50e8f717357\n\n1db0cc5e74198d5c09237795279efb28\n\nd0396014bd3219537b179e2133d7dd18\n\n86d1ed1246c35d69ec580ff2ce8b189f\n\n352f837f51b792c978c27cdac4be2453\n\nf404488eb9ace976f872e5a953c3329c\n\n66b944035e6369c84cbb2c8c4139e556\n\n75330228fce69f2537afb5846c69a7ca\n\n46142e232243bd7d6cbfe8dc8d576316\n\n70e9dfc595511ad71d543860433b02f5\n\n9bcacf1770295c8b2ccebfe8e843ccec\n\nccbad7304639bd0b93baad2a877923fd\n\neb7e00aa720c6145aa13608a4623f40b\n\n26f659c0b4125fcaec364fdcbdece018\n\nfe327314eb2f29690ae99baadb888651\n\nc9a0476bb60feb1d02fba5b22f094db6\n\nb4a37286503fe571115a590349fc2dee\n\n41d859a85dc5d2b405fc702f9df95265\n\n2f9e56c5eea5f4b7b880b0d26d140b63\n\n710f4efa4dc52b36901266fc0c09d810\n\nf2f6b2d9575d556855f12f6d244c5e9b\n\nSending C2\n\n\n-----\n\nrygqwf41[.]top/index.php\nrygedj410[.]top/index.php\n\nrygzil43[.]top/index.php\n\nrygiow53[.]top/index.php\n\nrygofx510[.]top/index.php\n\nrygsay57[.]top/index.php\n\nryghim51[.]top/index.php\n\nrygcwa58[.]top/index.php\n\nrygvpi61[.]top/index.php\n\nrygykd610[.]top/index.php\n\nrygkhf63[.]top/index.php\n\nrygckz67[.]top/index.php\n\nrygnih710[.]top/index.php\n\nrygcgf73[.]top/index.php\n\nrygsvk77[.]top/index.php\n\nrygcup71[.]top/index.php\n\njugpry110[.]top/index.php\n\njuglqr13[.]top/index.php\njugqay17[.]top/index.php\n\njugkeo11[.]top/index.php\n\njugrjb23[.]top/index.php\njugxmo21[.]top/index.php\n\njugfwr33[.]top/index.php\n\njugndj31[.]top/index.php\n\nDownloading C2\n\ngewfih05[.]top/download.php?file=fusate.exe\n\ngewfec07[.]top/download.php?file=insane.exe\n\ngewuib08[.]top/download.php?file=scrods.exe\n\ngewtuq10[.]top/download.php?file=swaths.exe\n\nkanimx01[.]top/download.php?file=zoster.exe\n\nkanlsu03[.]top/download.php?file=avulse.exe\n\nkanefo04[.]top/download.php?file=diazin.exe\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information-en/)\n\n\n-----",
