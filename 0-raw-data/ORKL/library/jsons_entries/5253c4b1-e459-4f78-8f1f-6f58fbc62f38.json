The emails target companies and organizations from different\nsectors of the economy that are associated with industrial production in one way or another.\n\n[We reported these attacks in 2018 in an article entitled “Attacks on industrial enterprises using](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2018/08/01/attacks-on-industrial-enterprises-using-rms-and-teamviewer/)\n[RMS and TeamViewer”, but recent data shows that the attackers have modified their attack](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2018/08/01/attacks-on-industrial-enterprises-using-rms-and-teamviewer/)\ntechniques and that the number of enterprises facing the threat of infection is growing.\n\nBefore publishing this report, we waited for the vendor of the RMS software to make changes\nto its services to ensure that the results of this research could not be used to exploit\nvulnerabilities.\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 1\n\n\n-----\n\n## This report in a nutshell\n\n          - From 2018 to at least the early fall of 2020, attackers sent phishing emails laced with\nmalware.\n\n          - The attacks make use of social engineering techniques and legitimate documents, such\nas memos and documents detailing equipment settings or other industrial process\ninformation, which have apparently been stolen from the company under attack or its\nbusiness partners.\n\n          - The attacks still use remote administration utilities. The graphical user interface of these\nutilities is hidden by the malware, enabling the attackers to control infected systems\nwithout their users’ knowledge.\n\n          - In the new version of the malware, the attackers changed the notification channel used\nafter infecting a new system: instead of malware command-and-control servers, they use\nthe web interface of the RMS remote administration utility’s cloud infrastructure.\n\n          - Stealing money from the organization under attack remains the main objective of the\nattackers.\n\n          - During an ongoing attack, the cybercriminals use spyware and the Mimikatz utility to steal\nauthentication credentials that are subsequently used to infect other systems on the\nenterprise network.\n\n**[The full article is available on Kaspersky Threat Intelligence.](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence)**\n\n**For more information please contact:** **ics-cert@kaspersky.com.**\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 2\n\n\n-----\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n[Since we described the technical details of this series of attacks in our previous report, Attacks](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2018/08/01/attacks-on-industrial-enterprises-using-rms-and-teamviewer/)\n[on industrial enterprises using RMS and TeamViewer, in this document we only list the main](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2018/08/01/attacks-on-industrial-enterprises-using-rms-and-teamviewer/)\nstages of an attack and describe the changes to the attackers’ tactics and toolset that have\nbeen implemented since the publication of the previous report.\n\n#### Spreading\n\nPhishing emails used in this attack are in most cases disguised as business correspondence\nbetween organizations. Specifically, the attackers send claim letters on behalf of a large\nindustrial company.\n\nPhishing email disguised as a claim letter\n\nIn the earlier attack series, the attackers used a sender email address with a domain name\nthat was similar to the official website address of the organization on whose behalf their\nphishing emails were sent. Now they use public email services to send their phishing emails\nand they use a different technique to mislead message recipients and persuade them to open\na malicious attachment: they pretend to be a real business partner or to represent a real\nsubsidiary of the company under attack and ask the recipient to view the documents attached\nby the deadline specified in the email, explaining the request by the approaching end of a\npurchase tender, possible penalties or the need to review equipment configuration data as\nsoon as possible.\n\nIt should also be emphasized that the phishing emails are individually crafted for each specific\ncompany that is attacked. This is demonstrated by the fact that the name of the company\nunder attack is mentioned in the email text, as well as by the documents used by the attackers\nas attachments (descriptions of the documents are provided below). In some of the cases\nidentified earlier, the attackers also addressed the recipient by his or her full name.\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 3\n\n\n-----\n\nPhishing email sent on behalf of a contractor\n\nAttachments used in phishing emails are password-protected archives, with the password\nprovided in the message body. The attackers explain this method of sending information by\nreferring to confidentiality considerations in the message body, but in reality password\nprotection prevents files stored in the archive from being scanned with antivirus tools.\n\n#### Malware Features\n\nThe archive attached to a phishing email contains several malicious obfuscated JS scripts that\nhave an identical functionality but slightly different structure due to different code obfuscation\ntechniques being used. The script names are usually disguised as document names.\n\nIf a user runs one of these scripts, two files are unpacked and opened: a malicious program\ndetected as HEUR:Backdoor.Win32.Generic, and a legitimate PDF file. Some JS script\nvariants found in phishing emails download these files from a remote server rather than\nextracting them from the script’s body.\n\nIn earlier attacks, to ensure that the user didn’t have questions regarding the absence of the\ndocuments mentioned in the message body and to distract the user while installing the\nmalware, the attackers opened a damaged PDF document or image or launched a legitimate\nsoftware installer.\n\nImage opened by the malware in earlier attacks\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 4\n\n\n-----\n\nIn their later attacks, the threat actor began to use actual documents related to the attacked\norganization’s area of work. A document can look like one created by a business partner or\neven the attacked organization itself. Specifically, documents used in attacks include scan\ncopies of memos, letters to subsidiaries and contractors, as well as procurement\ndocumentation forms that were apparently stolen earlier.\n\nPDF document containing instructions for subsidiaries, used by the attackers\n\nA fact of particular interest is that in some cases, the attackers used documents containing\nindustrial equipment configuration data and other information related to the industrial process.\n\nSpecifically, screenshots from the DIGSI application have been used. The application is\ndesigned to configure relay systems manufactured by Siemens.\n\nDIGSI software screenshot 1\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 5\n\n\n-----\n\nDIGSI is used by electric power facilities, such as substations, to configure their relay\nprotection systems.\n\nDIGSI software screenshot 2\n\nScreenshot of a relay system’s configuration matrix. List of setpoints\n\nWe also found screenshots with transformer oscillograms in documents used by the attackers:\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 6\n\n\n-----\n\nVector diagrams with oscillograms\n\nIt is worth noting that the last screenshot shows oscillograms for a system at the moment of an\naccident.\n\nPhishing emails with such screenshots do not call for the settings shown in attached\ndocuments to be implemented. It is most likely that the attackers use documents with the\nabove screenshots to distract the personnel while the malware is being installed. Since the\ndata mentioned above can provide a relay protection expert with information on standard\nsettings used at the facility, the fact that the attackers have such screenshots at their disposal\nis cause for concern.\n\nThe JS script then launches the malware, which installs a version of TeamViewer, a remote\nadministration tool (RAT), modified by the attackers. As in earlier attacks, the attackers use a\nmalicious DLL library to hide the graphical user interface in order to control the infected\nsystem without the user’s knowledge.\n\nIf additional information needs to be collected, the attackers download an additional set of\nmalware selected specifically for each victim. This can be spyware designed to collect\ncredentials for a variety of programs and services, including email clients, browsers,\nSSH/FTP/Telnet clients, as well as recording keypresses and making screenshots. In some\ncases, the Mimikatz utility is used to collect account credentials for Windows accounts entered\non the compromised system. The use of Mimikatz poses a particular danger, because it can\nprovide the attackers with access to a large number of systems on the enterprise’s network.\n\nIn most cases, the attackers disguise malware components as Windows components to hide\ntraces of malicious activity on the system.\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 7\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Infrastructure\n\nWhile analyzing the new series of attacks, we noticed two ways in which the infrastructure is\norganized differently from that used in earlier attacks.\n\nFirst, the attackers use resources disguised as websites of existing Russian-speaking\ncompanies to store files downloaded by malicious JS scripts at the system infection stage.\n\nThe second and more important difference is that the attackers no longer use a malware\ncommand-and-control server in their communication with infected systems.\n\nThe main reason for having a malware command-and-control server in this type of attack was\nthe need to get the infected machine’s ID in the TeamViewer system. The attackers already\nhad any other information they needed (the password required to connect was provided in a\nspecial configuration file). In the new series of attacks, the attackers sent the infected\nmachine’s TeamViewer ID using the legitimate infrastructure of the RMS remote\nadministration system.\n\nThis was possible because the RMS remote administration infrastructure has a dedicated web\nservice designed to notify the administrator that an RMS distribution package has been\ninstalled on a remote system. To send the notification, the RMS server generates an email\nmessage that contains the machine’s ID in the RMS system in the message body. For the\nmessage to be generated, it is sufficient for the RMS client to send an HTTP POST request to\nthe dedicated web page, providing the following data: product name, ID of the language pack\nused in the system, user name, computer name, email address to which the notification should\nbe delivered, and the machine’s ID in the RMS system assigned after installing the program.\n\nAttack kill chain\n\nThe underlying mechanism of the web service contained a vulnerability: it did not use any kind\nof authorization procedure. The malicious DLL responsible for hiding the TeamViewer graphic\ninterface included code for sending the request described above to the RMS server. However,\nit sent the machine’s ID in the TeamViewer system instead of its ID in the RMS system.\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 8\n\n\n-----\n\n## Victims\n\n\nThe ID length in the TeamViewer system is different from the ID length in the RMS system;\nhowever, since there is no verification of the contents of fields sent to the server in the HTTP\nPOST request, a notification message with information on a newly infected machine was\nsuccessfully delivered to the attacker’s address.\n\nKaspersky ICS CERT has notified RMS developers that their infrastructure is being used for\ncriminal purposes, providing them with all the technical details needed to close the\nvulnerability. To date, the vulnerability has not been closed by the developers, but a\nworkaround, filtration based on an address whitelist, has been implemented.\n\nIn other words, the functionality still works, but notification emails are only sent to email\naddresses included in a special list of customers ‘verified’ by RMS developers.\n\n**For technical details about this vulnerability please contact: ics-cert@kaspersky.com**\n\nAs mentioned above, the vast majority of attacked systems are industrial enterprises in Russia\nrepresenting various sectors of the economy. We identified attacks on companies from the\nfollowing industries:\n\n- Manufacturing\n\n- Oil and gas\n\n- Metal industry\n\n- Engineering\n\n- Energy\n\n- Construction\n\n- Mining\n\n- Logistics\n\nConsequently, this is not a case of an attack narrowly targeting one specific industry; however,\nsince most legitimate documents used in the attacks are from the energy sector, it can be\nassumed that the attackers have a particular interest in the sector.\n\n\n## Attribution\n\nWe are convinced that a Russian-speaking group is behind these attacks.\n\n[The main arguments in favor of this theory were offered in our previous report, “Attacks on](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2018/08/01/attacks-on-industrial-enterprises-using-rms-and-teamviewer/)\n[industrial enterprises using RMS and TeamViewer”.](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2018/08/01/attacks-on-industrial-enterprises-using-rms-and-teamviewer/)\n\nNote also that the code used to send requests to the RMS server, which was identified in the\nprocess of analyzing the new version of the malicious DLL, contains a language ID for the\nRussian localization of the operating system.\n\nAccording to available information, the main objective of the criminals is to steal money from\nvictim organizations’ accounts. This means that the attackers must have a good understanding\nof the financial workflow, which differs in some of its aspects from country to country, and\nsupport the appropriate infrastructure for cash withdrawal.\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 9\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group does not use any sophisticated tactics or technologies, but it carefully prepares\neach attack and expertly uses social engineering techniques, as well as technologies that are\nalready known from attacks staged by other criminal groups.\n\nWe believe that the group includes people responsible for the technical aspect of infecting\nvictims’ systems, as well as people responsible for financial operations, i.e., for stealing money\nfrom the group’s victims.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe threat actor continues to attack industrial enterprises successfully using relatively simple\ntechniques, but its methods are evolving. To persuade users of the legitimacy of phishing\nemails, criminals have begun to use documents that were apparently stolen during earlier\nattacks. It is worth noting that some of the documents used for this purpose contain\ninformation on industrial equipment settings and industrial process parameters. This is one\nmore reason to believe that these attacks specifically target industrial enterprises.\n\nThe main technical change in the attacks is that the attackers have discarded the most\nvulnerable stage in data collection and transmission – that is, malware command-and-control\nservers, which can be disconnected by the hosting provider or blocked by information security\nsystems. Instead, new system infection notifications are delivered via the legitimate web\ninterface of the RMS remote administration utility’s cloud infrastructure. Resources disguised\nas legitimate websites of existing organizations are used to store malware samples.\n\nThe attackers have full control of an infected system from the moment it becomes infected.\nStealing money from the organization’s accounts remains their main objective. When the\nattackers connect to a victim’s computer, they look for financial and accounting software\n(1C accounting software, bank-client, etc.). In addition, they find and analyze procurementrelated accounting documents and peruse the email correspondence of the enterprise’s\nemployees. After that, the attackers look for various ways in which they can commit financial\nfraud. We believe that the criminals are able to substitute the bank details used to pay\ninvoices.\n\nClearly, the attackers’ remote access to infected systems also poses other threats, such as\nthe organization’s sensitive data being leaked, systems being put out of operation, etc. As the\nlatest events have shown, the attackers use documents that were probably stolen from\norganizations to carry out subsequent attacks, including attacks on victim companies’\npartners.\n\nIf you have encountered an attack of this kind, you can report it to us through a [form](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/contacts/) on our\nwebsite.\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 10\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recommendations\n\n          - Train employees at enterprises in using email securely and, specifically, in identifying\nphishing messages\n\n          - Restrict the ability of programs to gain SeDebugPrivilege privileges (wherever possible)\n\n          - Install antivirus software with support for centrally managing the security policy on all\nsystems; keep the antivirus databases and program modules of security solutions up to\ndate\n\n          - Use accounts with domain administrator privileges only when necessary. After using such\naccounts, restart the system on which the authentication was performed\n\n          - Implement a password policy with password strength and regular password change\nrequirements\n\n          - If it is suspected that some systems are infected: remove all third-party remote\nadministration utilities, scan these systems with antivirus software and force a change of\npasswords for all accounts that have been used to log on to compromised systems\n\n          - Monitor network connections for any traces of remote administration utilities installed\nwithout proper authorization. Make a special emphasis on the use of RMS and\nTeamViewer utilities\n\n          - Use network activity filtration systems to block connections to servers and IP addresses\nlisted in Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n\n          - Never use obsolete versions of the TeamViewer utility (versions 6.0 and earlier). To\ndiscover any instances of obsolete versions of TeamViewer being used, the YARA rule\nprovided in Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise can be used\n\n          - It should be noted that, since the attack uses legitimate remote administration software,\nthat software can remain on the victim’s computer and continue operating even when the\nmalicious downloader has been removed. If remote administration software has been\nidentified at the stage of scanning corporate systems, it should be determined in each\ncase whether it was installed legitimately\n\n**For more information please contact:** **[ics-cert@kaspersky.com](mailto:ics-cert@kaspersky.com)**\n\nATTACKS ON INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES USING 11\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise\n```\n         File Hashes (malicious documents, malware, emails etc.)\n         • 386a1594a0add346b8fbbebcf1547e77\n         • 203e341cf850d7a05e44fafc628aeaf1\n         • 3b79aacdc33593e8c8f560e4ab1c02c6\n         • ea1440202beb02cbb49b5bef1ec013c0\n         • 1091941264757dc7e3da0a086f69e4bb\n         • 72f206e3a281248a3d5ca0b2c5208f5f\n         • da4dff233ffbac362fee3ae08c4efa53\n         • d768a65335e6ca715ab5ceb487f6862f\n         • 9219e22809a1dff78aac5fff7c80933c\n         • 86e14db0bcf5654a01c1b000d75b0324\n         File Names\n         • Акт.js\n         • Запрос 17782-09-1.js\n         • Перечень документов.js\n         • спецификация на оборудование xls.js\n         • tv.dll\n         • tv.ini\n\n```\nSome malware modules installed on the system have randomly generated names that follow a\nspecific format.
