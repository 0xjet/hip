The requested data can include logins and passwords or a debit card\nnumber. It can also use HTML injection to hide fraudulent transfers of money out of an\naccount by displaying an inaccurate bank balance.\n\nTrusteer noticed that SpyEye also hides fraudulent transactions even after a person has\nlogged out and logged back into their account. The latest feature is designed with the same\ngoal of keeping users unaware of fraud. The next time users log into their bank accounts,\nSpyEye will check its records to see what fraudulent transactions were made with the\naccount, then simply delete them from the Web page, said Amit Klein, Trusteer’s CEO. The\naccount balance is also altered.\n\nIt appears that SpyEye has borrowed more from Zeus, a famous piece of banking malware\nthat is now commonly available and considered the parent of SpyEye. The two pieces of\nmalware were competitors, but in 2010 merged. Zeus also has the capability to hide its\nfraudulent transactions from victims.\n\n“Zeus uses the stored balance details to inject into the same page at a later time to\npersistently hide the fact that money was fraudulently transferred from the user’s account,”\n[according to a September 2011 report by Ryan Sherstobitoff, an independent security](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&url=http://issa.org/images/upload/files/Sherstobitoff-The%20New%20Frontier%20for%20Zeus%20and%20SpyEye.pdf&xcust=2-1-473249-1-0-0&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/473249/spyeye_malware_borrows_zeus_trick_to_mask_fraud.html)\nresearcher, in the Information Systems Security Association Journal.\n\nTrusteer has seen the technique used when a fraudster uses SpyEye to capture a person’s\ndebit card details. When those details are obtained, the fraudster conducts a purchase over\nthe Web or phone, and SpyEye masks the transaction, Klein said. It does not affect,\nhowever, the bank’s ability to see the fraud, he said.\n\n_Send news tips and comments to jeremy_kirk@idg.com_\n\n_Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small_\n_commission.
