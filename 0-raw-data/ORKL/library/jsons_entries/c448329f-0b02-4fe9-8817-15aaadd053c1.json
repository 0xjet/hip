The malware-as-a-service, also called Bokbot, has been in extensive\nuse in the last couple of months by malspam distributors. Its latest version is delivered using\na malicious Microsoft office attachment, which eventually drops and executes the IcedID\npayload.\n\nThe specific Excel document used in the recent wave of attacks is using XLM macros to\ndownload and execute its payload. Although the XLM macro technology is quite old, it is only\n[recently that Microsoft added detection capabilities for XLM macros. This explains why so](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/03/xlm-amsi-new-runtime-defense-against-excel-4-0-macro-malware/)\nmany threat actors have chosen to spread their malware using this archaic capability.\n\n[The malicious document uses the windows API URLDownloadToFile in order to download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms775123(v=vs.85))\nthe IcedID payload to the path C:\\Users\\Public\\microsoft.security, which it later executes\nusing the WMIC binary.\n\nThis is a sample of the de-obfuscated macro:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe De-Obfuscated IcedID macro\n\n\nThe latest update to IcedID also saw a significant change to its first stage loading\n[mechanism, which was dubbed “gziploader” by Binary Defense’s researchers. The new](https://www.binarydefense.com/icedid-gziploader-analysis/)\nupdate uses a custom encryption algorithm to decrypt the actual bot which is hidden inside\nthe file “licenses.dat”.\n\nThe malware’s development is especially concerning because of its collaboration with\n[Sodinokibi (aka REvil) ransomware group, as reported by the DFIR Report. Their latest blog](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/03/29/sodinokibi-aka-revil-ransomware/)\npost’s details a breach starting with an IcedID infection that was escalated to a full-on\nransomware attack in just under 6 hours, fully encrypting the fake corporate network used by\nthe researchers.\n\nMinerva Prevents IcedID latest development with our Memory Injection Prevention &\nMalicious Macro Prevention modules:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Minerva Labs blocks the IcedID malware**\n\n\n**IOCs:**\n\n275a8e24dab9b523accb7205dc161a715216f7878f20adf7254cb640984f2edc (gziploader)\n\nc5444c7252d6e22f4a2de2168a4afeb08e1f841aeba675e6e632e2c64fcd71ca (excel file)\n\n**References:**\n\n[https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/08/09/bokbot-the-rebirth-of-a-banker/](https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/08/09/bokbot-the-rebirth-of-a-banker/)\n\n**https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/03/xlm-amsi-new-runtime-**\n**defense-against-excel-4-0-macro-malware/**\n\n**https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-**\n**explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms775123(v=vs.85)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[https://www.binarydefense.com/icedid-gziploader-analysis/](https://www.binarydefense.com/icedid-gziploader-analysis/)**\n\n**https://thedfirreport.com/2021/03/29/sodinokibi-aka-revil-ransomware/**\n\nTo learn more about Minverva Labs' Memory Injection Prevention module and how to protect\n[yourself from malware, contact us.](https://minerva-labs.com/contact-us)\n\n[« Previous Post](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/resurgent_purple_fox?hsLang=en-us)\n[Next Post](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/small-business-owners-guide-to-ransomware-protection?hsLang=en-us) »\n\n### Interested in Minerva?
