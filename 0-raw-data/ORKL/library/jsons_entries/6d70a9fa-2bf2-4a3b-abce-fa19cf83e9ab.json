Based on the timing\nand further dynamics, the attack was planned and organized specifically during Christmas\nperiod.\n\nThe incident has been identified as a part of a sophisticated cyberespionage campaign\nsupported by nation-state due to strong targeting against government, military-industrial\ncomplex, energy companies, financial institutions and large enterprises involved in critical\nareas of economy.\n\nBased our recent analysis, the threat actors leveraged a combination of tools, techniques\nand procedures (TTPs) allowing them to conduct a targeted network intrusion to access at\nleast 6 terabytes of sensitive data stored in the Citrix enterprise network, including e-mail\ncorrespondence, files in network shares and other services used for project management\nand procurement.\n\nWe forecast a continued growth of targeted cyber-attacks on supply chains of government\nand large enterprises organized by state-actors and sophisticated cyberespionage groups.\n\n**Updated (4:49 PM Monday, March 11, 2019 PDT)**\n\nBelow are the indicators of IRIDIUM activity available for disclosure (for today). We will\nupdate the list with new information once it becomes available.\n\nWe would like to thank the following organizations for their timely assistance and\ncollaboration regarding the malicious network activity during the Winter 2018 period: DHL,\nNBC (National Bank of Canada), Skrill, PayPal and Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.\n\n**Source IPs:**\n\n178.131.21[].19[] (Iran)\n\n5.115.23[].11[] (Iran)\n\n5.52.14[].23[] (Iran)\n\n**Used proxies:**\n\n23.237.104.90 – Canada (VPN)\n\n194.59.251.12 – USA (VPN)\n\n185.244.214.198 – Poland\n\n138.201.142.113 – Germany\n\n92.222.252.193 – France (Nov 29, 2018)\n\n51.15.240.100 – France (Dec 7, 2018) x 3 times\n\n\n-----\n\n**Updated (5:09 PM Monday, March 11, 2019 PDT)**\n\nThe Global Access List (GAL) acquired as the result of password-spraying (on Citrix\nemployee accounts), which is a type of attack for brute-forcing and credential-stuffing,\nincludes 31,738 records. The threat actors leveraged it for further reconnaissance and\naccounts compromise. Based on our analysis, one of these elevated actions was\nconducted on Monday, October 15, 2018 at 1:57 AM.\n\nPassword-spraying was one of the most commonly used techniques by Mabna Institute\nhackers and their associates during the early stage of the attacks to gain a foothold in the\nvictim’s environment. More information about their techniques is available in FBI Flash\n[Alert (ME-000092-TT):](https://www.aha.org/system/files/2018-03/ME-000092-TT-mabna_0.pdf)\n\nLeveraging the initial group of compromised accounts, download the Global Address\nList (GAL) from a target’s email client, and perform a larger password spray against\nlegitimate accounts.\nUsing the compromised access, malicious actors attempt to expand laterally (e.g.,\nvia Remote Desktop Protocol or other means) within the network, and perform mass\ndata exfiltration.\n\n**Updated (8:55 PM Monday, March 11, 2019 PDT)**\n\nAs a result, threat actors conducted network intrusion to access data in Citrix infrastructure\nremotely.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mitigation Measures:**\n\n– Azure AD and ADFS best practices: Defending against password spray attacks\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2018/03/05/azure-ad-and-adfs-bestpractices-defending-against-password-spray-attacks/\n\n– Spray you, spray me: defending against password spraying attacks\n\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/spray-you-spray-me-defending-against-passwordspraying-attacks\n\n\n-----",
