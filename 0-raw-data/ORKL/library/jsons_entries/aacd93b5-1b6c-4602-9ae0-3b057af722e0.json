One of these apps, called Camero, exploits [CVE-2019-2215, a vulnerability that](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-2215)\nexists in Binder (the main Inter-Process Communication system in Android). This is the first known active\nattack in the wild that uses the [use-after-free vulnerability. Interestingly, upon further investigation we also](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/11/bad-binder-android-in-wild-exploit.html)\nfound that the three apps are likely to be part of the SideWinder threat actor group’s arsenal. SideWinder, a\n\nSTART\n\n\n-----\n\nWindows machines.\n\nThe three malicious apps were disguised as photography and file manager tools. We speculate that these apps\nhave been active since March 2019 based on the certificate information on one of the apps. The apps have\nsince been removed from Google Play.\n\nFigure 1. The three apps related to SideWinder group\n\nFigure 2. Certificate information of one of the apps\n\n**Installation**\nSideWinder installs the payload app in two stages. It first downloads a DEX file (an Android file format) from\nits command and control (C&C) server. We found that the group employs [Apps Conversion Tracking to](https://developers.google.com/app-conversion-tracking)\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n\nconfigure the C&C server address. The address was encoded by Base64 then set to referrer parameter intions surrounding your blog preferences? the\nURL used in the distribution of the malware.\n\n\nSTART\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Parsed C&C Server address\n\nAfter this step, the downloaded DEX file downloads an APK file and installs it after exploiting the device or\nemploying accessibility. All of this is done without user awareness or intervention. To evade detection, it uses\nmany techniques such as obfuscation, data encryption, and invoking dynamic code.\n\nThe apps Camero and FileCrypt Manger act as droppers. After downloading the extra DEX file from the\nC&C server, the second-layer droppers invoke extra code to download, install, and launch the callCam app on\nthe device.\n\nFigure 4. Two-stage payload deployment\n\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n**tions surrounding your blog preferences?**\n\nSTART\n\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n**tions surrounding your blog preferences?**\n\n\n-----\n\nTo deploy the payload app callCam on the device without the user’s awareness, SideWinder does the\nfollowing:\n\n1. Device Rooting\nThis approach is done by the dropper app Camero and only works on Google Pixel (Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL),\nNokia 3 (TA-1032), LG V20 (LG-H990), Oppo F9 (CPH1881), and Redmi 6A devices. The malware\nretrieves a specific exploit from the C&C server depending on the DEX downloaded by the dropper.\n\nFigure 6. Code snippet from Extra DEX downloaded by Camero\n\nWe were able to download five exploits from the C&C server during our investigation. They use the\nvulnerabilities CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU to get root privilege.\n\nFigure 7. CVE-2019-2215 exploit\n\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n**tions surrounding your blog preferences?**\n\nSTART\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. MediaTek-SU exploit\n\nAfter acquiring root privilege, the malware installs the app callCam, enables its accessibility permission, and\nthen launches it.\n\nFigure 9. Commands install app, launch app, and enable accessibility\n\n2. Using the Accessibility Permission\nThis approach is used by the dropper app FileCrypt Manager and works on most typical Android phones\nabove Android 1.6. After its launch, the app asks the user to enable accessibility.\n\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n**tions surrounding your blog preferences?**\n\nSTART\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Steps FileCrypt Manager prompts user to do\n\nOnce granted, the app shows a full screen window that says that it requires further setup steps. In reality, that\nis just an overlay screen that is displayed on top of all activity windows on the device. The overlay window\nsets its attributions to [FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE and](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE) [FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE, allowing the activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE)\nwindows to detect and receive the users’ touch events through the overlay screen.\n\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n**tions surrounding your blog preferences?**\n\nSTART\n\n\n-----\n\nMeanwhile, the app invokes code from the extra DEX file to enable the installation of unknown apps and the\ninstallation of the payload app callCam. It also enables the payload app’s accessibility permission, and then\nlaunches the payload app. All of this happens behind the overlay screen, unbeknownst to the user. And, all\nthese steps are performed by employing Accessibility.\n\nFigure 12. Code enabling install of unknown apps and new APK\n\nFigure 13. Code enable accessibility permission of the newly installed app\n\n**callCam’s Activities**\n\nThe app callCam hides its icon on the device after being launched. It collects the following information and\nsends it back to the C&C server in the background:\n\n\nLocation\nBattery status\nFiles on device\nInstalled app list\nDevice information\nSensor information\nCamera information\nScreenshot\nAccount\nWifi i f ti\n\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n**tions surrounding your blog preferences?**\n\nSTART\n\n\n-----\n\nThe app encrypts all stolen data using RSA and AES encryption algorithms. It uses SHA256 to verify data\nintegrity and customize the encoding routine. When encrypting, it creates a block of data we named\nheadData. This block contains the first 9 bytes of origin data, origin data length, random AES IV, the RSAencrypted AES encrypt key, and the SHA256 value of AES-encrypted origin data. Then the headData is\nencoded through the customized routine. After the encoding, it is stored in the head of the final encrypted file\nfollowed by the data of the AES-encrypted original data.\n\nFigure 14. Data encryption process\n\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n**tions surrounding your blog preferences?**\n\n\n**Will you take a few moments to answer a few ques‐**\n**tions surrounding your blog preferences?**\n\n\nFigure 15.
