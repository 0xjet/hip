A common type of Linux threat is cryptojacking, which is the unauthorized use of](https://www.intezer.com/blog/cloud-security/top-linux-cloud-threats-of-2020/)\nan IT system for the purpose of mining cryptocurrency. While cryptominers are well-documented, it’s not often that you get an\ninside look. It’s rare to see the dashboard of the wallets being used in an active cryptojacking campaign with dozens of\nvictims, as well as the attacker’s profit margin.\n\n[This post details an ongoing cryptojacking campaign targeting Linux machines, using exposed Docker API ports as an initial](https://www.intezer.com/resource/fixing-a-common-yet-deadly-mistake-misconfigured-docker-api-ports/)\naccess vector to a victim’s machine. The attacker then installs a Golang binary, which is undetected in VirusTotal at the time\nof this writing.\n\nThe file serves as a Monero cryptominer installer and sets up configuration for the miner. The attack uses SSH to maintain\nsuperiority on the victim’s machine, leaving a backdoor and installing its own SSH keys on the host.\n\nThis campaign has been active for nearly a year. We are certain that each day at least one payment is passed into two\nwallets and there are currently 95 workers. Workers are victim machines whose resources are being used to mine\ncryptocurrency for the attacker. A snapshot of the active workers is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Snapshot of workers mining cryptocurrency for the attacker_\n\n## Attack Flow\n\nA new attack flow takes advantage of a known Docker misconfiguration, putting the host at risk for being compromised. The\nattacker exploits this misconfiguration to gain full control over the Docker daemon and creates a new container with access to\nthe host’s filesystem. With access to the filesystem, the attacker installs malware on the Docker host.\n\nFirst, the attacker establishes a stable SSH connection by adding their own SSH key to the host and editing the configuration\nof the SSH service to allow password authentication. These modifications remove dependency on the misconfiguration,\ngiving the attacker a stable connection to the victim.\n\nNext, they install two binary files on the host: an XMRig Miner at location /usr/share/dbus-1/bin/ and an orchestrator file at\n**/usr/share/color/. We analyzed this file and came to the conclusion that it’s being used to execute XMRig Miner and to**\nensure it keeps running.\n\nThe orchestrator is responsible for preparing and initializing configurations for the execution of the coinminer malware. Before\nrunning the coinminer, it verifies the path /usr/share/dbus-1/bin contains two files: systemd-host (aka the miner) and the\nother named IBus, the miner’s configuration file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: The attack flow_\nThe path /usr/share is not commonly seen in Linux malware and is writable only with root privileges. The path /tmp is more\noften seen as an installation path in Linux malware since it does not require root privileges. The attacker has root privileges\nbecause the container they escaped from has them and hence the attacker has access to /usr. Placing the files at /usr may\nimply that they are taking advantage of the high privileges they have in order to use this path as some sort of hiding technique\nthat is harder to detect.\n\nThe configuration file reveals interesting insights about the miner and the attack campaign. From the configuration we can tell\nthat the target cryptocurrency is Monero, known to be more private than other coins like Bitcoin. This means that the details of\nthe transaction amounts and the sender/recipient identities are disguised. In addition, we found the address of the pools and\n[the IDs of two wallets used in this campaign. The address of the pools belongs to supportxmr domain and the wallets are still](https://supportxmr.com/)\nactive at the time of this publication.\n\n## Take a Look (or Two) at the Dashboards\n\nIt’s rare to find an active wallet with victim information for a few reasons. Management of the wallets is taken care of by\nanother server that acts like a proxy so that the malware connects without providing the wallet. In some cases, the wallets are\nnot active or have only a few workers. In this recent attack, we found a live dashboard—shown in Figure 3— that is constantly\nupdated with new workers and paints the full picture of this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Screenshot of the first mining dashboard_\nThe dashboard shows that this campaign has been active for almost a year with both wallets receiving at least one payment\nper day. One of the wallets averages 95 workers while the second wallet averages four workers, meaning the campaign is still\noperational and has about 100 victims to date.\n\n_Figure 4: Screenshot of the second mining dashboard_\n\n## Insights About the Victims\n\n_Figure 5: Screenshot of the active workers, their names and hash rates_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Screenshot from_ _[Monero benchmarks](https://monerobenchmarks.info/)_\nUsing the randomx CPU benchmarks, we can cross-reference the hash rates seen in the dashboard (Figure 4) with the CPU\ntype that generates them as shown in Figure 5. From this comparison we can see that most of the victims are not machines\nwith high levels of performance but rather standard hosts similar to your home computer. But if we examine the rates from the\nwallet that has only three workers, we can infer its workers have more computing resources than those in the other wallet\ngiven their CPU power.\n\nIt’s possible that the attacker uses different wallets to separate high and low performance victims.\n\nWe examined the workers’ names. Some of them contain a string that looks like a date, which we assume is the date of\ninfection. In Figure 6, for example, the marked numbers can be translated into 01/11, or January 11.\n\n_Figure 7: Screenshot from the dashboard disclosing the name of the worker_\n\n## Mitigation\n\n Fix your Misconfigured Docker API Port\n\nMisconfiguration of the Docker API port is one of the most common yet deadly mistakes users can make. Fortunately, this\n[cryptomining operation can be easily avoided just by having a secure configuration. Download our How-To Guide to configure](https://www.intezer.com/resource/fixing-a-common-yet-deadly-mistake-misconfigured-docker-api-ports/)\nyour Docker API ports in 4 simple steps.\n\n## Docker Security Best Practices\n\n[This article provides a checklist of Docker security best practices, from development and deployment onto the production](https://www.intezer.com/blog/container-security-blog/best-practices-for-securing-a-docker-runtime-environment/)\nenvironment. In addition, you can verify that other misconfigurations do not pose a risk to your environment via lateral\n[movement by referencing this list of Docker misconfigurations.](https://dev-sec.io/baselines/docker/)\n\n## Intezer Protect Community Edition\n\nAdvanced attacks like SolarWinds and Pay2KEY have shown that focusing only on vulnerabilities in your own code is not\nenough to secure your environment. It’s time to assume breach and detect and respond to attacks when they occur in\nproduction.\n\n[Intezer Protect is a Cloud Workload Protection Platform designed to protect Linux machines in runtime against unauthorized](http://www.intezer.com/)\ncode. With Intezer Protect you can easily detect cryptominers and other threats in your cloud, as well as identify the\nmisconfiguration that could have been exploited—in this case, in Docker. [Try our free community edition.](https://protect.intezer.com/signup)\n\n\n-----\n\nExecuting the orchestrator file will prompt an immediate alert in Intezer Protect as seen in Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 8: Execution of the orchestrator captured in Intezer Protect_\nWhen XMRig Miner is executed by the first file, Intezer Protect will trigger a second alert as seen in Figure 9.\n\n_Figure 9: Intezer Protect alert triggered upon the execution of XMRig Miner_\n\n_Figure 10: Intezer Protect reports on Docker misconfiguration with an open API port_\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat described in this post is an example of a well detected miner that uses SSH to maintain connection with the victim;\nbut also leaves a “trail” that privies us to information we rarely get to see from a cryptojacking campaign.\n\nCryptomining malware has become a familiar threat on Linux servers because it’s relatively cheap and easy to launch. It’s not\noften that you get to see how profitable these campaigns can be for the attacker—with access to the wallets, how much they\nearned and the dashboard as the attacker sees it.\n\n## IoCs\n\n XMRig Miner\n\n240fe01d9fcce5aae311e906b8311a1975f8c1431b83618f3d11aeaff10aede3\n\n## Miner_installer\n\n8ecffbd4a0c3709cc98b036a895289f33b7a8650d7b000107bafd5bd0cb04db3\n\n## Wallets’ Addresses\n\n43Y5gWFUZmCS9JjkY5V4QA86to5wyAWMbZUdPYtiG7EF8ZKk4uA3BAj1eMoTns8whPJEoeaVdy55L1wcBkKn894kUpdimMq\n[(mining pool: https://supportxmr.com/)](https://supportxmr.com/)\n\n49XZTjHS4aNjWgPhxbWNnDhiKnuJL4YKdE7JEyf45U1yYYe9ebTiS9PPUg8yJEL26eNHECyLH2DnUCuDgoZhhdiFVgD19kP\n[(mining pool: https://supportxmr.com/)](https://supportxmr.com/)\n\n49r6Mp1fcb4fUT5FPTgaz9E47fZV7n6JiY76c4vdBZvgDm8GmWHTVYM9Azpe4MsA9oXs2RpUNPPfH7oXABr3QnwNQKaP2W7\n[(mining pool: https://supportxmr.com/)](https://supportxmr.com/)\n\n43Xbgtym2GZWBk87XiYbCpTKGPBTxYZZWi44SWrkqqvzPZV6Pfmjv3UHR6FDwvPgePJyv9N5PepeajfmKp1X71EW7jx4Tpze\n[(mining pool: https://xmr.nanopool.org)](https://xmr.nanopool.org/)\n\n82etS8QzVhqdiL6LMbb85BdEC3KgJeRGT3X1F3DQBnJa2tzgBJ54bn4aNDjuWDtpygBsRqcfGRK4gbbw3xUy3oJv7TwpUG4\n[(mining pool: https://www.f2pool.com)](https://www.f2pool.com/)\n\n47PXdhiZphNHka2K1J9udPj5Nct4zpvCRUMqwVY4Rvyxf3FLmPqyR6J68hDX4fUF65jNxJa43szPM3Ni5zDerArzSkdFp1K\n[(mining pool: https://supportxmr.com/)](https://supportxmr.com/)\n\n47xS7CWWZ8c7xdxBcuiqA7KLK8kRFcaLFPViKA9w3eHVe2WcKj8iaBEADzZYXGqE9sCC71cbu64qrZhZZkafzFn2VPA9xs9\n[(mining pool: https://minexmr.com/)](https://minexmr.com/)\n\n**Nicole Fishbein**\nNicole is a malware analyst and reverse engineer.
