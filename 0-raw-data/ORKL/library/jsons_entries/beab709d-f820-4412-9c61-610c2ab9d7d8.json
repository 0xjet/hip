    "plain_text": "# Back to School: Why Cybercriminals Continue to Target the Education Sector | Part One\n\n**[ke-la.com/back-to-school-why-cybercriminals-continue-to-target-the-education-sector/](https://ke-la.com/back-to-school-why-cybercriminals-continue-to-target-the-education-sector/)**\n\nAugust 3, 2020\n\nJust a few of the major headlines regarding the education sector have looked like this over\nthe last couple of months:\n\n[Blackbaud Hack: Universities Lose Data to Ransomware Attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53516413)\n\n[The University of California Pays $1 Million Ransom Following Cyber Attack](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/06/29/the-university-of-california-pays-1-million-ransom-following-cyber-attack/#46fbb84118a8)\n\n[University of York Discloses Data Breach, Staff and Student Records Stolen](https://www.zdnet.com/article/university-of-york-discloses-data-breach-staff-and-student-records-stolen/)\n\nThe past year has seen a rise in the amount of education-related institutions that have been\naffected by cyberattacks. In 2019 alone, the K-12 cyber incident map reported that 348\nschools have publicly-disclosed that they’ve been a victim of a cyberattack. That’s just in the\nUnited States and doesn’t even take into account the universities and colleges, which would\nby all means cause those numbers to escalate.\n\nThese statements got us wondering.\n\nAre underground threat actors actively looking for and interested in targeting\norganizations in the education sector?\nWhat types of attacks are we seeing affecting the education sector?\nWhat have been some of the recent attempted attacks that we’ve seen in the\nunderground ecosystem?\nAre these targeted attacks on the universities themselves or are they stemming from\naccess through a third-party provider?\n\nThese are all questions that will be addressed throughout this blogpost.\n\n## Cybercriminals Looking for the Big Money\n\nAt first glance, educational institutions, such as universities, local and state district schools,\ncolleges, and others, may seem of little to no worth to underground threat actors. However, if\nthat were the case, it would likely have nothing to do with the ethical factors of attacking\neducational institutions – something that was [taken into consideration by threat actors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/03/19/coronavirus-pandemic-self-preservation-not-altruism-behind-no-more-healthcare-cyber-attacks-during-covid-19-crisis-promise/#227295f252be)\ndiscussing targeting the health sector.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile browsing through various underground forums, we ve found many threat actors\nclaiming that they’re not looking to target any businesses that have annual revenue less than\n$300 million, or any institutions in the government, education, healthcare, hotel and ecommerce sectors. What do (cybercriminals assume) those may have in common? It’s\nmerely a matter of profiting maximally. Underground cybercriminals don’t seem to view the\nbig money from attacking the organizations listed above, and therefore prefer to place their\nefforts elsewhere.\n\nThough many cybercriminals seem to stand behind this, we still noticed that there are still a\ngood amount of them that do in fact choose the route of targeting educational institutions as\nthey do see potential profits, and sometimes even very big ones. The following section in this\npost will dive into how institutions in the education sector are being targeted in all different\nways, causing some of them to eventually incur severe financial costs.\n\n## A Look into Educational Institution Attempts and Attacks\n\nFrom large databases posted for sale, to remote admin access available on auto shops, and\nransomware negotiations, institutions in the education sector have seen heaps of different\nthreats and potential attacks.\n\nJust last week, analysts at KELA noticed two university databases being sold on an\nunderground forum – one pertaining to a London-based college, and the other to the\nuniversity in California – both sold by the same actor, “Neversec.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing a quick assessment on this threat actor, our team assessed that Neversec is a\nrather new threat actor who registered on this forum on July 11. His past activities showed\nhim selling databases belonging to a Saudi Arabian company and government agencies in\nthe Dominican Republic, Chile, and Malaysia. Additionally, we found him sharing two guides\n[for cybercriminals across underground forums, one of them being the StationX guide and](https://courses.stationx.net/p/the-complete-cyber-security-course)\ncybersecurity course. In the case of the two institutions listed above, Neversec claimed that\nhe successfully managed to obtain the databases directly from the institutions’ systems\nthemselves.\n\nOnce we acquired samples and began our analysis, we found that the two databases contain\nat least first and last names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses. Though small in\nquantity – 1,800 records for the California-based university and an even smaller 720 for\nLondon one – we weren’t quick to deem this unimportant just yet. These credentials –\nbelonging to the institutions’ students, staff, and alumni – can be leveraged for phishing\nattacks, something that could provide threat actors with an initial foothold into the networks of\nthe universities. Once they’ve got this first foot in the door, threat actors may easily use this\nunprivileged access to further explore the victims’ networks and may eventually deploy\nransomware or other malware on the institutions’ systems.\n\nTake the case of the University of California, for example. Though we do not know if it was as\na result of a compromise through phishing emails, the university paid a ransom of more than\n$1 million. As with any business, cybercriminals must start from somewhere and all they\nneed is that initial foothold – something that compromised credentials may assist them with.\n\n\n-----\n\nBrowsing further through some cybercrime forums, we stumbled upon a threat actor going by\nthe handle “maroder” (previously “ailing”) posting access to two university networks for sale.\nIn his past, maroder was seen selling accesses to various organizations’ networks, as well\noffering services of fund withdrawals from crypto exchanges, and even selling dumps of\ncrypto exchanges. After conversing further with the seller, we managed to identify these\nvictims to be two major universities, one in Israel and another in Germany.\n\nSelling so called “access” is a rather fluid term and can enable a plethora of different actions\nfor threat actors, depending on each of their goals. Though the threat actor cannot confirm\nwhether the access is on an admin level or not, he does specify that this will enable Citrix\naccess to the universities’ networks.\n\n_Translation from Russian:_\n\n_Selling 2 uni_\n\n_Israel and Germany_\n\n_I do not know the rights_\n\n_People with reputation will give access first_\n_Purely symbolic – 400 $ for both_\n\nMaroder/ailing’s activities targeting education-related institutions didn’t stop there. Among\none of his latest activities, from this past weekend, maroder was seen selling Citrix access to\na school in UK with a current revenue of $100 million and more than 500 employees. Since\nthis was only some days ago, the access again is undetermined however, maroder seems to\nbe hunting down more targets of this type.\n\nAs mentioned above, compromised credentials can be an initial foothold for a larger attack.\nHowever, access to servers either via a direct attack or through a third party, can cause even\nmore severe damage to victims.\n\nBy using DARKBEAST – KELA’s Darknet threat hunting technology – we ran a quick search\nfor breached servers including the search term <university>, and were left with dozens of\n[education-related institutions with compromised website access for sale.](https://ke-la.com/access-as-a-service-remote-access-markets-in-the-cybercrime-underground/)\n\n\n-----\n\nTake this web shell access to a university s network for example. In the example below, upon\npurchase, buyers would gain immediate access to run a number of operations against the\nuniversity such as editing files, editing the server’s root directory, sending emails from the\ndomain, and more. This web shell access can grant threat actors several different routes of\nattack once they’ve gotten in.\n\n_Example of Web Shell Access for a [.]edu site for sale, captured by KELA’s_ _[DARKBEAST.](https://ke-la.com/our-solutions/)_\n\nAt other times, we’ve seen universities being targeted as part of an attempted larger attack.\nOn a well-known underground forum, we recently came across a threat actor posting VPN\naccess for sale belonging to a US-based university, however when analyzing further content\nin the listing, most attention was pointing at the potential access it provides to a prominent\nUS ISP and managed service company – the hosting service of the university. Upon further\nanalysis we determined the access to this service company false, however would it have\nbeen true, it would have made the perfect use case for an example of something that can be\nused for deploying ransomware or other malware, stealing data, etc. Even though this was\npurely a marketing scheme, utilizing universities in an aim to attack a bigger target is a\ncommon occurrence.\n\nJust last week, we noticed a threat actor selling access to another US-based university that\nwas linked to many other big corporations. We found a threat actor identifying as ”EronM” on\na Russian-language cybercrime forum offering access to various organization across\n\n\n-----\n\ndifferent fields. This threat actor was leveraging corporations linked to other larger\norganizations to maximize profits further than just the university itself. In this case, the\n[university was linked by domain trust to a large Japanese company, which could mean that](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secmgmt/primary-and-trusted-domains)\nusers in the university’s trusted domain could authenticate to resources of the company.\nCybercriminals could therefore leverage this access to compromise the larger company’s\nnetwork.\n\n_From Russian: “Selling access_\n\n_Entry USA university_\n\n_5 trusts, 1 of the trusts is a company worth 340 million (about us: Company R***, established in 1936,_\n_offers document services, consulting, software and hardware to businesses around the world. This is_\n_where you can find out about our rich history, company philosophy and community activities, along with_\n_the awards and accreditations we’re proud to call our own.)_\n\n_, a daughter company of a 2 trillion company_\n\n_R*** Company Ltd – a Japanese company producing multifunctional devices, digital copiers, laser printers,_\n_digital duplicators, fax machines, digital cameras and camcorders, disk drives, microcircuits and_\n_semiconductors, software and network solutions. The company was 429 in Fortune Global 500 for the_\n_year 2011[1]_\n\n_Price 1 btc”_\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nAs highlighted in several of the examples above, threats don’t always necessarily stem from\na direct target on the university itself, and even when direct attacks occur, they’re not\nnecessarily in an aim to attack the institution itself, rather it may be a part of a larger, more\nprofitable attack. Nowadays, organizations, are obligated to look out for any potential threats\non their entire supply chain in addition to their direct assets. The supply chain of\norganizations, though sometimes overlooked, can offer threat actors the perfect entry point\ninto organizations. As seen in the ongoing weekly occurrences, institutions in the education\nsector are surely a target for many cybercriminals. These institutions should leverage\nadvanced threat intelligence technologies to monitor their assets in real time, to ensure that\nthey’re maintaining a reduced attack surface and catching any potential threats at an early\nstage.\n\n\n-----",
