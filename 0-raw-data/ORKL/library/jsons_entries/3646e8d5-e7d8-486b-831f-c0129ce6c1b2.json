Russia-Aligned TA499 Beleaguers Targets with Video Call Requests\n\n**[proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/dont-answer-russia-aligned-ta499-beleaguers-targets-video-call-requests](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/dont-answer-russia-aligned-ta499-beleaguers-targets-video-call-requests)**\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\n[Blog](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog)\n[Threat Insight](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight)\nDon’t Answer That! Russia-Aligned TA499 Beleaguers Targets with Video Call Requests\n\nMarch 07, 2023\nZydeca Cass and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nTA499, also known as Vovan and Lexus, is a Russia-aligned threat actor that has\naggressively engaged in email campaigns since at least 2021.\nThe threat actor’s campaigns attempt to convince high-profile North American and\nEuropean government officials as well as CEOs of prominent companies and celebrities\ninto participating in recorded phone calls or video chats.\nThe calls are almost certainly a pro-Russia propaganda effort designed to create\nnegative political content about those who have spoken out against Russian President\nVladimir Putin and, in the last year, opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nTA499 is not a threat to take lightly due to the damage such propaganda could have on\nthe brand and public perception of those targeted as well as the perpetuation of\ndisinformation.\n\n## Overview\n\nProofpoint researchers have been tracking malicious email campaigns by the Russia-aligned\nTA499, publicly known as Vovan and Lexus, since early 2021. TA499’s campaigns began to\nramp up in late January 2022, culminating in increasingly aggressive attempts after Russia\ninvaded Ukraine in late February 2022. Since that time, the threat actor has engaged in\nsteady activity and expanded its targeting to include prominent businesspeople and highprofile individuals that have either made large donations to Ukrainian humanitarian efforts\nor those making public statements about Russian disinformation and propaganda. These\nmessages try to solicit information from the targeted individuals and entice them into further\ncontact via phone calls or remote video. The emails have not contained malware, only\ncommunications or invitations purporting to be from an embassy of Ukraine, Ukraine’s\nPrime Minister, a Ukrainian parliamentarian, or their assistants.\n\nProofpoint tracks TA499 as an impersonation-based, patriotically motivated misinformation\npair of actors aligned with the Russian state. The group has a record of targeting high-profile\npersons of interest that have spoken out about the Russian regime in favor of sanctions\n\n\n-----\n\nagainst Russia, and against the detainment of well-known Russian opposition leader Alexei\nNavalny. While the level of official government support TA499 receives is unknown, the\nrecordings are generally used to garner support and sympathy for the current Russian regime\nand their actions.\n\n## Critiques of Putin, Russia Spur TA499 Action in 2022\n\nTA499’s email campaigns kicked into high gear as tensions built between Russia and Ukraine\nand has not abated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\n_Figure 1. Timeline of TA499 activity in 2022._\n\nSince late-January 2022, the threat actor has largely focused its email attempts on\nscheduling a video or phone call meeting with high-profile North American or European\ngovernment officials and CEOs of prominent companies. In a shift from their 2021 activity,\nthese campaigns have almost exclusively centered on topics relating to the Russia-Ukraine\nwar. Even after TA499 expanded its victimology in March 2022 to include public figures not\nin government positions, such as businesspeople and celebrities, the threat actor kept with\nthese same social engineering themed lures.\n\nOnly in the latter half of 2022 did TA499 begin to reincorporate some of its pre-war themes\nand email addresses, but those continue to be a fraction of their overall activity.\n\n**Early 2022: TA499’s initial 2022 campaigns used the same actor-controlled domain**\n(oleksandrmerezhko[.]com) and sender address (office@oleksandrmerezhko[.]com) as its\n2021 campaigns, and directly targeted individuals that had spoken out regarding:\n\nBill to Arm Ukraine against Russia\n\n\n-----\n\nSupport of Sanctions on the Nord Stream II Pipeline\nBombing of Russian military assets and other military actions\n\nBy March 2022, amid a backdrop of condemnation by the international community of\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine and instatement of sanctions, TA499\nadopted new personality impersonations. Most notably, the threat actor began to\nmasquerade as the Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and his purported assistant. To\nmake the emails convincing in their legitimacy, the sender addresses leveraged the popular\ninternet service and email provider Ukr.net and pretended to be from either “the Embassy of\nUkraine to the US” or “the Embassy of Ukraine in the US:” embassy.usa@ukr[.]net and\nembassy.us@ukr[.]net. The subjects focused on Ukrainian officials making requests of the\ntargets, such as:\n\nUkrainian Parliament – [Target Name]. Request\nPrime Minister of Ukraine. Request\nUkrainian Parliament – [Target Name]\nEmbassy of Ukraine - CEO [Target Name]. Request\n\nAs seen in Figure 2, Proofpoint researchers identified and tracked this new activity through\nTA499’s preference for including their new sender addresses in the TO: or CC: lines of email\ncampaigns leveraging older addresses. It is important to note that the threat actor cycles\nthrough its addresses. While one may appear to have gone dormant, it could return in future\nTA499 campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Proofpoint attributed email addresses to TA499. The threat actor primarily used_\n_the first four in 2021 and the last two in its 2022 campaigns; however, TA499 started to_\n_leverage its Navalny and Merezhko email addresses again in late 2022._\n\nAccording to open-source reporting, in addition to the Proofpoint-identified campaigns, the\n[Shmyhal personality was used to target two UK cabinet members as well. Given the](https://twitter.com/BWallaceMP/status/1504486042048425988?s=20&t=ovEKo1elnkqMbVDETwK9cQ)\nsimilarities in tactics, Proofpoint researchers assess with high confidence that this was the\nwork of TA499.\n\n**Mid-2022: By mid-2022, TA499 started to explore using an additional embassy-themed**\nemail address (embassy.chernysh@ukr[.]net) and even utilized an actor-controlled\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)-themed domain (office@iaea[.]co[.]uk) to send\nemails with a subject line of “URGENT: IAEA Director General” to international aides and\nassistance of senior government officials. The timing of this activity aligned with a public\nstatement by the IAEA Director General about the urgent situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia\nnuclear power plant. It is likely that the international attention surrounding the state of the\npower plant inspired TA499’s decision to use an IAEA lure.\n\n## A Return to Early TA499 Themes\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough the rest of 2022, TA499 integrated email addresses not observed in Proofpoint data\nsince at least March 2022, including those pretending to be Oleksandr Merezhko, a\nUkrainian Member of Parliament (MP) and Vice President of the Parliamentary Assembly of\nthe Council of Europe (PACE), and Leonid Volkov, the Chief of Staff for Russian opposition\nleader Alexei Navalny (noted in Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 3. In late 2022, TA499 again posed as Merezhko and used email address_\n_office@oleksandrmerezhko[.]com. This address was dormant between March 2022 and_\n_September 2022._\n\nNavalny has long been a focus for TA499 campaigns with the threat actor targeting\nindividuals with an interest in and publicly positive stances on the oppositionist since early\n2021. Timeline analysis and Proofpoint telemetry have revealed targeting of individuals\nexplicitly involved in the statements condemning the arrest of Navalny on February 2nd,\n2021, and the reintroduction of the Holding Russia Accountable for Malign Activities Act of\n2021 on February 3rd, 2021. As seen in the sample email in Figure 4, TA499 has repeatedly\nused social engineering with a focus on directing conversation to easily recorded meetings\nand subject lines such as:\n\n“Request. Vice-President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe\n(PACE)”\n\n\n-----\n\n[redacted] - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny s team\n“Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's team – [redacted]”\n“Alexei Navalny's Chief of Staff - [redacted]. Request”\n“Re: Meeting with Mr Volkov”\n\n_Figure 4. A 2021 email message posing as Leonid Volkov, Alexei Navalny’s Chief of Staff._\n\n## The World is Watching…On YouTube (or RUTUBE)\n\nTA499 posts recordings of its video calls on YouTube and RUTUBE. One of the threat actor’s\nYouTube channels was taken down early in the Russia-Ukraine war, forcing TA499 to revert\nto using one of its older YouTube channels for posting.\n\nFor high-profile targets that agree to follow-up video calls, TA499 has pretended to be\nvarious people, going so far as to use extensive makeup to appear exactly like the\nimpersonated individual. They have masqueraded as the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys\nShmyhal, and Oleksandr Merezhko. Video calls recorded in 2021 show TA499 impersonating\n[Leonid Volkov as well. Open-source reporting has detailed the use of Deepfake Artificial](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407264/deepfake-european-polticians-leonid-volkov-vovan-lexus)\nIntelligence software to explain how TA499 takes on Volkov’s appearance, and possibly that\nof others, though the malicious actor denies the use of the software. The actor does not\nappear to be using any voice modulation, primarily focusing on the targets’ lack of familiarity\nwith the contact and the element of surprise.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Screenshot (left) from TA499’s first episode of “Дипфейк Шоу” or “Deepfake_\n_Show,” where Lexus impersonates Leonid Volkov, and picture of the real_ _[Volkov (right) for](https://twitter.com/leonidvolkov)_\n_comparison._\n\nConversations with TA499 typically begin serious and allow the target to voluntarily say as\nmuch information as possible. Once the target begins asking questions, the actor mirrors the\ntarget’s replies to keep the conversation going. Some of the 2021 videos with the threat actor\nhave the Leonid Volkov impersonator asking for financial support and appear to encourage\nthe target into voicing particular obligations and efforts in tandem with the Russian\nopposition led by Navalny. Once the target makes a statement on the matter, the video\ndevolves into antics, attempting to catch the target in embarrassing comments or acts. The\nrecordings are then edited for emphasis and placed on YouTube and Twitter for Russian and\nEnglish-speaking audiences.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. TA499 posted a “video call” with fugitive Kazakh oligarch Mukhtar Ablyazov on_\n_the threat actor’s YouTube channel, which has since been taken down._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTA499 is a very public group that is garnering a fan following. They have personas that not\nonly post the material discussed in this report online but also perform reenactments on\nRussia state-sponsored media as well as attend conferences. With the war between Russia\nand Ukraine unlikely to end in the near-term and Ukraine continuing to garner support from\norganizations worldwide, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that TA499 will attempt\nto continue with its campaigns in support of its influencer content and political agenda.\nTA499 is likely to reuse old or establish additional infrastructure in support of this activity.\n\nBeing a target of this group is gradually becoming more common. While the primary\ntargeting of TA499 remains the C-level or the highest profile positions possible at any given\nentity, Proofpoint recommends that anyone who suspects they might be a target of TA499’s\ntake care in verifying the identities of those inviting them to conduct business or discuss\n\n\n-----\n\npolitical topics over video conferencing. In particular, if high-profile individuals reach out\nsuddenly via email and without prior introduction through a known and verified source, you\nshould proceed with caution.\n\nCheck out the latest podcast episode on DISCARDED, Prank or Propaganda?
