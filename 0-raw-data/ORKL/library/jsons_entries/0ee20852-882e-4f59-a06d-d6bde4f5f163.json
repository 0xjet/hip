As authorities across multiple countries continue to implement sanctions\nand openly communicate current trends to the public, threat groups increasingly resort to\nrebranding or creating similar variants under different names to sidestep crackdowns and\nobfuscate their identities.\n\n[In a February 2023 blog post, Ahnlab described a new ransomware campaign affecting](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/46812/)\nSouth Korean organizations which deployed a malware they dubbed “TZW” ransomware.\nOur research links TZW ransomware to a known malware family called GlobeImposter\n(sometimes referred to as LOLNEK or LOLKEK). Close inspection of host origins and\nprominent file similarities used in both TZW and GlobeImposter campaigns suggest that\nactors behind GlobeImposter are updating their payloads and obfuscating their infrastructure\nin a manner consistent with a rebrand effort.\n\n## Overview of GlobeImposter & New Variant TZW\n\n\n-----\n\nGlobeImposter has a long and winding history. First observed in-the-wild in 2016, the name\n“GlobeImposter” is based on the ransomware’s mimicry of Globe ransomware payloads.\n[Multiple new](https://blog.360totalsecurity.com/en/globeimposter-which-has-more-than-20-variants-is-still-wildly-growing/) [versions and variations of GlobeImposter have appeared in the years since.](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-center/threat-profiles/ransomware-variants/globeimposter)\nFrequently, these have been referred to by their extension (e.g., .DREAM, .Nutella, .NARCO,\n```\n.LEGO). However, these are all part of the same umbrella malware family. In that same year,\n\n```\nEmisoft released a decryption tool for early versions of GlobeImposter. Shortly after, the\nmalware authors responded with an updated version for which no decryption tools are\navailable.\n\nSince 2017, campaigns delivering GlobeImposter have continued to proliferate even though\nthe ransomware has only evolved slightly. The ransomware has also been used in\nconjunction with some well-documented high-end cybercriminal groups. For example, in\n2017 [TA505 (also known as G0092, GOLD TAHOE) began using GlobeImposter in](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/breaking-ta505s-crypter-with-an-smt-solver/)\nreplacement of Jaff, [GandCrab, and](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/sentinelone-detects-protects-gandcrab-ransomware/) [Snatch to extend the reach and effectiveness of their](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/how-ransomware-attacks-are-threatening-our-critical-infrastructure/)\ncampaigns.\n\n## GlobeImposter’s Delivery Methods Explained\n\nGlobeImposter is most often delivered via phishing email as an attachment or a link to a\nmalicious attachment. The payloads are typically distributed via 7zip or traditional zip file\n[archives. The archives often include a JavaScript (.js) file that downloads and executes the](https://labs.vipre.com/javascript-in-a-7zip-archive-attachment-installs-a-variant-of-globeimposter-ransomware/)\nGlobeImposter payload.\n\nMore recent campaigns from within the past three years still tend to follow this formula.\n\nGlobeImposter has also been distributed as a later-stage infection within some well-known\n[botnets. For example, in 2017 GlobeImposter was distributed via the Necurs botnet. This](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/12/26/index.html)\noccurred as part of multiple spam campaigns that also included 7zip archives and followed\nthe execution flow previously described.\n\n## Linking TZW Attacks to GlobeImposter\n\nAhnLab’s research revealed a ransomware campaign they referred to as “TZW” with victims\nin South Korea. The name is derived from the first 3 characters of the TOR-based victim\nportal. A closer look suggests that “TZW” samples represent a new variant of the\nGlobeImposter family.\n\nThe pre-TZW GlobeImposter ransom notes follow the same template as the current TZW\nsamples. Ransom note similarities are far from reliable, but it’s worth noting their likenesses.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of a GlobeImposter ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of a TZW variant GlobeImposter ransom note.\nOnce a machine is infected, more concrete markers indicate a deeper level of similarity. One\nsuch marker is the “CRYPTO LOCKER” string appended to the tail of the encrypted files.\nThis is a known marker present across GlobeImposter variants.\n\nExamples of CRYPTO LOCKER markers at EOF (TZW and LOLKEK variants).\n\n\n-----\n\nGlobeImposter has the ability to delete volume shadow copies, thereby inhibiting the\nrecovery of data. There are clear similarities around the methodology of the VSS removal.\n\nGlobeImposter shadow copy removal highlights.\n\n\n-----\n\nGlobeImposter vs TZW variant shadow copy removal procedure.\nCode and functionality, by and large, are identical across GlobeImposter payloads pointing to\n```\nobzuqvr5424kkc4unbq2p2i67ny3zngce3tbdr37nicjqesgqcgomfqd[.] onion and those\n\n```\npointing to the newer\n```\ntzw7ckhurmxgcpajx6gy57dkrysl2sigfrt6nk4a3rvedfldigtor7ad[.]onion.\n\n```\nA thorough comparison of the two respective samples shows there are only minor\ndifferences.\n\n\n-----\n\nZoomed-out view of GlobeImposter (hex) compared against the TZW variation.\nAhnLab’s research describes artifacts from a specific sample within a specific campaign. We\nhave seen the newer TZW variations vary somewhat with regards to file metadata.\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo TZW payloads, varied file metadata\nA majority of the TZW variant samples that we have analyzed resemble the version on the\nleft hand side. The version on the right was seen in the samples noted by AhnLab.\n\n## Understanding TZW and GlobeImposter’s Shared Infrastructure\n\nPrevious GlobeImposter payloads directed victims to a TOR-based portal at\n```\nobzuqvr5424kkc4unbq2p2i67ny3zngce3tbdr37nicjqesgqcgomfqd[.]onion.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nGlobeImposter Victim Portal 1.\nBeginning in late 2022, we start to see victims also being directed to\n```\ntzw7ckhurmxgcpajx6gy57dkrysl2sigfrt6nk4a3rvedfldigtor7ad[.]onion. The interfaces\n\n```\nand required steps are identical:\n\nGlobeImposter Victim Portal 2 from late 2022 onward.\nAt the time of writing, both victim portals remain active. In addition, we can confirm the\nrelationship between these via the publicly-viewable Apache Server Status Page.\n\nThis Apache status screen is visible as a result of a misconfiguration on the Apache server,\nallowing us to see all the active vhosts (virtual hosts) present there.\n\n\n-----\n\nApache Status\n\npage – GlobeImposter victim portal.\nThrough this view we see that the following vhosts are active on the device.\n```\nobzuqvr5424kkc4unbq2p2i67ny3zngce3tbdr37nicjqesgqcgomfqd[.]onion\n\ntzw7ckhurmxgcpajx6gy57dkrysl2sigfrt6nk4a3rvedfldigtor7ad[.]onion\n\nlinux[.]3bcd0a[.]com\n\n\n```\nVhosts on GlobeImposter victim portal.\nThis evidence of shared infrastructure suggests that the newly rebranded TZW ransomware\nsamples are likely being operated by the same group that was pushing recent waves of\nGlobeImposter malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n## How to Protect Against GlobeImposter and TZW Ransomware\n\nSentinelOne Singularity™ protects against malicious behaviors and malware associated with\nGlobeImposter and TZW.\n\nWith the site policy set to Protect, GlobeImposter ransomware is detected and prevented\nautomatically. In Detect-only mode, analysts can observe the malware’s behaviour and file\nencryption attempts, rolling back the device to a clean state on completion of the test.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QrNSunn3Wu8\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on our analysis, the TZW ransomware recently documented by AhnLab is yet another\nexample of the threat actors behind GlobeImposter pivoting their TTPs alongside a rebrand,\nincluding a new but related Onion address. We also show that the old “LOLNEK” Onion\naddress and the Onion address within the TZW variant are hosted on the same server as\ntwo vhosts.\n\nRegardless of the name or brand, GlobeImposter continues to pose a threat to enterprises.\nEnsuring good user hygiene, along with strong, properly-configured, and robust security\ncontrols will go a long way to prevent these attacks from affecting your environment.\n\nSentinelOne Singularity™ protects against malicious behaviors and malware associated with\nGlobeImposter and TZW.\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QrNSunn3Wu8\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA1**\n\n4585da0ff7a763be1a46d78134624f7cd13e6940\n\n14be1c43fbfb325858cda78a126528f82cf77ad2\n\ndc98b516c9c589c2b40bc754732ad5f16deb7c82\n\nd034880d1233d579854e17b6ffad67a18fb33923\n\n858f3f7f656397fcf43ac5ea13d6d4cbe7a5ca11\n\n9a080cd497b8aa0006dc953bd9891155210c609c\n\n8c64e820a4c5075c47c4fbaea4022dc05b3fd10b\n\n3326708ba36393b1b4812aa8c88a03d72689ac24\n\ncf5ab37612f24ed422a85e3745b681945c96190e\n\ncf21028b54c4d60d4e775bf05efa85656de43b68\n\n**Onions**\n\ntzw7ckhurmxgcpajx6gy57dkrysl2sigfrt6nk4a3rvedfldigtor7ad[.]onion\n\nobzuqvr5424kkc4unbq2p2i67ny3zngce3tbdr37nicjqesgqcgomfqd[.]onion\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK\n\n[T1005 – Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\n\n[T1202 – Indirect Command Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202/)\n\n[T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[T1070.004 – Indicator Removal: File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004/)\n[T1112 – Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/)\n\n[T1012 – Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/)\n\n[T1083 – File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\n\n[T1027.002 – Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002/)\n\n[T1082 – System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n\n[T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\n\n[T1547.001 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n\n\n-----",
