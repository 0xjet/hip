Similar to a “follow the money” approach in](https://www.osce.org/magazine/447688)\ncriminal investigations, looking at conflict zones can reveal cyber capabilities deployed as\npart of events —either by the parties to the conflict itself, or third parties interested in\nmonitoring events for their own purposes.\n\nThe above theory is supported by historical incidents linked to geopolitical tensions:\n\n[Russia’s invasion of Ukrainian territory leading to, among other events, the 2015 and](https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf)\n[2016 Ukraine power incidents, the](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CRASHOVERRIDE.pdf) [2017 NotPetya event, and](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) [continuing operations to](https://therecord.media/ukraines-top-cyber-cop-on-defending-against-disinformation-and-russian-hackers/)\nthe present.\n[Tensions in the Arabian/Persian Gulf region leading to multiple](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/business/global/cyberattack-on-saudi-oil-firm-disquiets-us.html) [rounds of](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/) [wiper](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-destructive-threat-re-emerges-new-sting-its-tail)\n[malware as well as providing possible “cover” for the 2017 Triton/TRISIS incident.](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OAJ4VZNJ)\nContinuing strains on the Korean peninsula providing cover for the 2018 disruptive\nattack on the Pyeongchang Olympic Games (even if the attacker in this case was not\nNorth Korea).\n\nBased on precedent, analysts can identify developments in adversary operations and\ntechnical capabilities by tracking identifiers related to major events and conflict zones.\nIdentifying capabilities deployed to take advantage of such items can yield insights into\nfundamental attacker tradecraft and behaviors, and enable defense and response for\nincidents which may strike far closer to home at a later date.\n\n## Initial Discovery: Caucasus Conflict\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the above thesis in mind, DomainTools researchers examined technical artifacts\n[emerging around the 2020 conflict between](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/15/world/europe/azerbaijan-armenia-nagorno-karabakh.html) [Armenia and Azerbaijan in the](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/16/five-ways-2020-nagorno-karabakh-conflict-will-change-map/) Caucasus\nregion. While investigating, researchers discovered the following malicious document file on\na commercial multi-scanner service:\n```\nName: PKK militants in Nagorno-Karabakh.doc\nMD5: e00af9b6303460666ae1b4bdeb9503ba\nSHA1: ce810173555d6a98ce10c847f16e95575fe13405\nSHA256: 7c495c21c628d37ba2298e4a789ff677867521be27ec14d2cd9e9bf55160518f\n\n```\nMasquerading as a news article covering details about the Caucasus conflict, the document\ncontains a reference to an external site to fetch additional material to the victim’s computer:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this specific case, the document attempts to communicate to the domain\n“msofficeupdate[.]org”:\n\n\n-----\n\nOverall, the document appears focused on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict with dedicated\nnetwork infrastructure enabling the attack sequence. While we could stop and view this item\nin isolation, further analysis reveals even more interesting elements.\n\n## Identifying Items for Pivoting\n\nBoth the document and the domain contain items of interest for further analysis and\n[pivoting. Reviewing lessons from a previous DomainTools blog, we can examine the](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects?utm_campaign=current-events-to-widespread-campaigns-pivoting-from-samples-to-identify&utm_source=Blog)\ntechnical indicators related to this campaign as composite objects with opportunities to\ndiscern fundamental adversary behaviors.\n\nExamining the document, file metadata, shown here using Phil Harvey’s [ExifTool, indicates](https://exiftool.org/)\nthe presence of an unusually long string of numbers as a template object:\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the template object and a hard-coded Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the\ndocument will attempt to communicate to the domain identified above. The actual\nfunctionality of the malicious document hinges on network communication to the attacker\ndomain, with an HTTP request to a resource such as the following:\n```\nhXXps://msofficeupdate[.]org/morgue6visible5bunny6culvert7ambo5nun1illuminate4\n\n```\nAll following functionality appears dependent on a response to this request. At this time,\nDomainTools does not have any data or other information as to what may be returned from\nthis response. As a result, our analysis is limited to the document itself and identified\nnetwork infrastructure. However, defenders may find value in the URL pattern in the HTTP\nrequest—words divided by single numbers—for developing Network Intrusion Detection\nSystem (NIDS) signatures.\n\nLack of view into follow-on execution aside, we have a search string to use to fingerprint\nadditional file samples or to disposition items that may be related to the original campaign in\nthe template string. Notably, for a malicious document, the item does not contain any active\n\n\n-----\n\ncontent (ActiveX objects or Visual Basic for Applications [VBA] macros), limiting our ability\nto identify further items. However, the template item appears unique enough to serve as a\nsignifier to identify additional samples similarly constructed.\n\nOn the infrastructure side, we have several more leads to follow. As [previously documented](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects?utm_campaign=current-events-to-widespread-campaigns-pivoting-from-samples-to-identify&utm_source=Blog)\n[in past blogs on infrastructure hunting and analysis, we have a combination of technical](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/extrapolating-adversary-intent-through-infrastructure?utm_campaign=current-events-to-widespread-campaigns-pivoting-from-samples-to-identify&utm_source=Blog)\nindicators related to domain creation and hosting as well as thematic identifiers related to\nthe domain name itself. For the domain in question, as seen in the previous DomainTools\nIris Investigate inspection image above, the following observations hold:\n\nLeaked registrant email, “g.j.dodson[AT]protonmail[.]com”.\nDomain registration service, “PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com”.\nAuthoritative name server associated with the domain, “bitdomain[.]biz”.\nHosting on a dedicated server, “46.30.188[.]236”, through the Netherlands-based\nprovider “Web2objects Gmbh”.\nAn SSL/TLS certificate obtained through Sectigo with limited identifying information.\nA domain “theme” of mimicking Microsoft Office update services.\n\nWhile any of the above items in isolation may be relatively limited for identifying adversary\ntendencies or additional infrastructure—either by being too general or far too specific—in\ncombination, they can yield patterns for further analysis. For example, looking for a\ncombination of privacy-centric email addresses registering domains via\nPublicDomainRegistry using the name server “bitdomain[.]biz” hosted in Europe with\nSectigo SSL/TLS certificates can yield a result set for further analysis. Applying a “thematic”\nsearch to the results of such an investigation, such as looking for other Microsoft or Office\nthemes in domain names, can identify additional items for analysis related to this campaign.\n\n## Unraveling Additional Infrastructure\n\nBased on the characteristics described in the previous section, DomainTools researchers\nidentified 35 domains matching the patterns associated with the initially observed malicious\n[domain at varying levels of estimative probability or confidence. As shown in the following](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/sherman-kent-and-the-board-of-national-estimates-collected-essays/6words.html)\ntable, we can observe additional tendencies such as favoring several privacy-oriented email\nservices during registration and an overwhelming focus on European Virtual Private Server\n(VPS) providers for hosting purposes.\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Date**\n**Created** **Registrant Email** **IP Addre**\n\n\n**iphoneupdatecheck[.]com** **2016-**\n**05-12**\n\n\n**louie@brookes.openmailbox.org** **91.236.1**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Date**\n**Created** **Registrant Email** **IP Addre**\n\n\n**brexitimpact[.]com** **2016-**\n**06-23**\n\n**srv3-serveup-ads[.]net** **2019-**\n**04-16**\n\n**newoffice-template[.]com** **2019-**\n**06-12**\n\n\n**ms-check-new-**\n**update[.]com**\n\n\n**2019-**\n**07-08**\n\n\n**jaroslav88@tuta.io** **185.112.**\n\n**salemjoshi@protonmail.com** **101.100**\n\n**j.konnoban@email.cz** **147.135**\n\n**stivgarret@protonmail.com** **87.121.9**\n\n**N/A** **66.70.21**\n\n**hostmaster@user-twitter.com** **N/A**\n\n**sam.walker@tutanota.com** **137.74.1**\n\n**alex.sval@tutanota.com** **198.24.1**\n\n**s.taylor87@seznam.cz** **185.243**\n\n**laptev.vl.90@mail.ru** **N/A**\n\n**laptev.vl.90@mail.ru** **91.195.2**\n\n**adam.crowld@protonmail.com** **51.161.9**\n\n**paul_wilsonn@protonmail.com** **192.52.1**\n\n**p.borovin@protonmail.com** **158.69.3**\n\n**boxerkeen@protonmail.com** **103.255**\n\n**pavel.savin1992@bk.ru** **66.248.2**\n\n\n**template-new[.]com** **2019-**\n**08-28**\n\n**user-twitter[.]com** **2019-**\n**11-13**\n\n**live-media[.]org** **2019-**\n**11-27**\n\n**officeupgrade[.]org** **2019-**\n**11-29**\n\n**template-office[.]org** **2020-**\n**01-10**\n\n**get-news-online[.]com** **2020-**\n**01-15**\n\n**liveinfo[.]org** **2020-**\n**01-15**\n\n**newoffice-update[.]com** **2020-**\n**02-11**\n\n**update-office[.]com** **2020-**\n**03-03**\n\n**upgrade-office[.]com** **2020-**\n**03-18**\n\n**tls-login[.]com** **2020-**\n**03-25**\n\n**upgrade-office[.]org** **2020-**\n**04-07**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Date**\n**Created** **Registrant Email** **IP Addre**\n\n\n**newupdate[.]org** **2020-**\n**06-04**\n\n**2020-windows[.]com** **2020-**\n**06-19**\n\n**petronas-me[.]com** **2020-**\n**07-05**\n\n**msupdatecheck[.]com** **2020-**\n**07-10**\n\n**log1inbox[.]com** **2020-**\n**08-15**\n\n**gmocloudhosting[.]com** **2020-**\n**08-17**\n\n**msofficeupdate[.]org** **2020-**\n**08-20**\n\n**interior-gov[.]com** **2020-**\n**08-31**\n\n**e-government-pk[.]com** **2020-**\n**09-04**\n\n**e-govoffice[.]com** **2020-**\n**09-07**\n\n**azureblog[.]info** **2020-**\n**09-25**\n\n**rneil[.]ru** **2020-**\n**10-01**\n\n**weather-server[.]net** **2020-**\n**10-09**\n\n**doc-fid[.]com** **2020-**\n**10-21**\n\n**rarnbler[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-09**\n\n\n**and.frolov@bk.ru** **46.183.2**\n\n**gmail.chrome.2020@mail.ru** **176.107**\n\n**cgog.global@gmail.com** **N/A**\n\n**mike.barrett@tutanota.com** **167.114.**\n\n**vazquezftcathyo5123@gmail.com** **N/A**\n\n**hostmaster@gmocloudhosting.com** **N/A**\n\n**g.j.dodson@protonmail.com** **46.30.18**\n\n**gmail.chrome.2020@mail.ru** **N/A**\n\n**gmail.chrome.2020@mail.ru** **N/A**\n\n**hostmaster@e-govoffice.com** **N/A**\n\n**yshevloin@protonmail.com** **N/A**\n\n**hostmaster@rneil.ru** **N/A**\n\n\n**N/A**\n\n\n**lulgaborova90@protonmail.com** **N/A**\n\n**hostmaster@doc-fid.com** **N/A**\n\n**nesmali20@cock.li** **80.78.22**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Date**\n**Created** **Registrant Email** **IP Addre**\n\n\n**msofficeupdate[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-10**\n\n**netserviceupdater[.]com** **2020-**\n**11-11**\n\n**new-office[.]org** **2020-**\n**11-13**\n\n\n**emil.moreu@protonmail.com** **185.25.5**\n\n**hostmaster@netserviceupdater.com** **N/A**\n\n**moris.pelletier@yahoo.com** **51.89.50**\n\n\nWhile the majority of items were created in 2020, some potentially related network\nobservables date as far back as 2016. When matched against malicious document samples\nexamined in the following section, we begin to see the outlines of a persistent, somewhat\nlengthy campaign. Although extended in time, the same fundamental network behaviors are\nreflected in observed items throughout this period.\n\nObserved visually, such as in the DomainTools Iris Investigate visualization below, we see\nclusters of activity divided between name servers, registrars, and Top Level Domains\n(TLDs). With an even larger population, we could begin to distill even more aspects of this\nadversary’s methods of operation and potentially devise predictive algorithms for future\ninfrastructure creation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Locating Additional Samples\n\nIn addition to identifying additional network infrastructure, a combination of reviewing the\noriginal document as well as pivoting off of observed network infrastructure yields additional\nmalicious document samples. Primarily, the unique Template string of numbers combined\nwith relationship to domains and document themes enable the discovery of additional items.\nAs shown in the following table, these items are linked through both the unique Template\nstring as well as contacting infrastructure related to the analysis provided above on network\nobservables.\n\n**SHA256** **File Na**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** **File Na**\n\n**1f117d5f398e599887ec92a3f8982751ceb83f2adb85d87a2c232906104e8772** **C.

Additionally, they extend\nfrom December 2019 through November 2020, indicating this activity has continued without\nsignificant change for nearly a year.\n\nIn addition to these items, DomainTools researchers also identified a second set of\ndocuments, all originating from France, with a “testing” theme but matching various\ncharacteristics of the above items, such as the unique Template string:\n\n\n**SHA256**\n\n\n**File**\n**Names**\n\n\n**29b49fc728510b8d10a84edbd884cd23a0c453c1158551dbd2d266539d5d09b5** **testmw**\n\n**da43472f3bced232ae8f905e819339fb75da0224a31fb1c394110c77b3318b09** **testmw**\n\n**6478821432b8458053d953b6cff7d1b49f4349f5da366278778c87bc8789b65c** **testmw**\n\n**4285a05a993359b8418b590d3309a361f2c42ef7bc29216c0209e57b74513adb** **testmw**\n\n**40b21a2cd054e01cf37eb22d041ef2ea652eaaeae0ba249439fa7ec07a4e9765** **testmw**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256**\n\n\n**File**\n**Names**\n\n\n**282c805363469440eef082ac0f2a52dbdd47a8cdaecc08df4c1b4c073c5a8256** **testmw**\n\n**df2a85d84daf10b4dcf8d8fdd83493f3c04f2ac7b3edaf4730df0522cc52009f** **testmw**\n\nThe items above stand out from the other documents for several reasons:\n\nAll were submitted to the same multiscanner service on the same day.\nThe items appear to be iterative given the file naming schema (testmw2, testmw3,\netc.).\nAnalysis of the files indicates fuzzing or alteration of capability among them, in line\nwith the iterative nature of the file names.\n\nAn initial conclusion would be these are “testing” runs for a malicious document format or\ntemplate which would emerge in later campaigns. However, the timing is off for this\nconclusion to hold as the “test” items appear in mid-September when items using the same\ntemplate (functionality and lure document) first appear in December 2019.\n\nOverall, this batch of items remains somewhat a mystery as there are no obvious signs\nlinking it to other campaigns. Additionally, some of the items in question are non-functional\nor lack other components linked to the activity in the first set of documents associated with\na likely persistent campaign. DomainTools does not possess any additional information to\ndisposition these items at this time, so they remain somewhat of a mystery relative to the\nother malicious documents which appear more clearly designed for espionage purposes.\n\n## Motivations and Attribution\n\nThe identified documents emerge from multiple locations but overwhelmingly focus on\nAzerbaijan and Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore interesting still are the themes associated with the documents in their text and titles. In\naddition to the document which sparked this investigation and its themes centering on the\nrecent conflict on the Caucasus, identified topics include the following:\n\nC. Bayramov.doc: references the Azerbaijani foreign minister, Ceyhun Bayramov.\nФадеев M1.doc: presents itself as a fundraising advertisement for a documentary\nfilmmaker covering events in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, an area of conflict.\nО поставке зенитных ракетных систем С-400.doc: masquerades as a report on the\nS-400 air defense system, produced by Russia and sold to multiple countries.\nПланируемые расходы 2020(1).doc: “Planned Expenses 2020”, a document that\nappears to show personnel expenses for a Ukrainian local government entity.\nStrategic Defence and Security Review (2021 SDSR).doc: a strategic defense\nplanning document intended for the Slovenian defense ministry. Notably, this\ndocument appears related to a phishing email sent to an individual who appears to be\nthe Slovenian military attache to the country’s embassy in the Russian Federation.\nСправочник АП_26.10.2020_.doc: a planning document from the Russian-backed but\n[unrecognized breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/07/russia-ukraine-donetsk/398942/)\nНовые поправки к Госпрограмме переселения в РФ (вст. в силу 01.07.2020).doc: a\ndocument on internal resettlement within the Russian Federation.\nМинтруд госслужба.doc:a document from the Russian-backed but unrecognized\n[breakaway Luhansk People’s Republic.](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/four-years-luhansk-peoples-republic/)\n\n\n-----\n\nOverall, documents appear related to political, military, and related subjects largely in\nconflict zones such as the Caucasus and the Russian-backed breakaway regions of eastern\nUkraine. Additional items, such as the Slovenian defense document which DomainTools\nresearchers were able to link to a phishing email, strongly imply state-sponsored interests\nfor espionage or similar purposes as motivating this campaign.\n\nIn October 2020, [several](https://twitter.com/pewpew_lazors/status/1316059407717990400?s=20) [researchers noticed some of the documents identified in this](https://twitter.com/craiu/status/1316053846007910403?s=20)\n[report and linked it to a group referred to in public reporting as “Cloud Atlas” or “Inception.”](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0100/)\nWhile data available at present does not completely align with prior Cloud Atlas activity, the\nfollowing commonalities are observed:\n\nTargeting focusing on Russian near-abroad regions.\nUse of template objects for initial activity through malicious documents.\nLikely reliance on network communication to retrieve second-stage tooling for followon activity.\n\nThe response to the HTTP requests sent by the documents would presumably be the key\nfor aligning the above campaigns to the Cloud Atlas actor, but absent this evidence\nDomainTools can neither confirm nor deny association to this group at present.\n\nIrrespective of specific attribution, possible links to a known Advanced Persistent Threat\n(APT) actor (Cloud Atlas) combined with campaign themes that are highly political in nature\nwith no obvious mechanism for monetization make the discovered campaign a likely statesponsored or state-directed espionage campaign. While targeting in this case may imply\nRussian-related interests, it is important to note that earlier Cloud Atlas activity has also\n[targeted entities in the Russian Federation. One possible alternative hypothesis given the](https://securelist.com/recent-cloud-atlas-activity/92016/)\ntargeting in Russia, as well as a focus on breakaway regions in Ukraine, is that the activity\nrepresents Ukraine-sponsored cyber espionage activity. Although interesting, again\ninsufficient evidence exists to support this hypothesis at this time.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the activity described above is certainly concerning, available information at this time\ndoes not support even weak attribution to any state interest, with only plausible (but as yet\nunproven) links to the Cloud Atlas entity. Although specific attribution may not be possible,\nwe can nonetheless conclude with high confidence that this activity represents cyber\nespionage activity directed by some, as yet unknown, state actor.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTracking themes related to geopolitical events can be quite fruitful for discovering active\ncampaigns likely related to state-sponsored interests. In the above example, searching for\nitems related to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict in the Caucasus in late 2020 yielded a\nmalicious document. Further analysis of this document and related infrastructure then led to\nthe discovery of additional items which outlined an entire campaign stretching back to 2019.\n\nWhile the victims of this campaign appear geographically limited, largely focusing on\nUkraine and Azerbaijan, the lessons drawn from the analysis of both the malicious\ndocuments and related network infrastructure can be used to further defense against similar\ntypes of attacks. By monitoring for these types of event-specific incidents, CTI analysts can\ngain insight into emerging APT activity and deploy defensive countermeasures shortly after\ndiscovery.\n\nTo learn how to identify and track adversary operations in DomainTools Iris Investigate visit\nour product page.\n\n[Learn More](https://www.domaintools.com/products/iris/?utm_campaign=current-events-to-widespread-campaigns-pivoting-from-samples-to-identify&utm_source=Blog)\n\n## The DomainTools Security Research Team Discusses Their Analysis:\n\n\n-----",
