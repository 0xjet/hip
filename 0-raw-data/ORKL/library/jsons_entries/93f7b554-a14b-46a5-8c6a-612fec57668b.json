By the fact that**\n**some Threat Actor let theirs DLL with an invalid header for avoiding to**\n**correctly run in sandbox or in AV sandbox and modify it for run by a**\n**loader (side-loading with multiples files [Header + DLL], script for**\n**rebuilding the header...).**\n\n**As the first look, we can see the anomaly on the PE header based on**\n**redirection to a part of malware.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The timestamp is valid if we compare to the other sections (proving that**\n**doesn't modified), the internal name in the import section and the**\n**exported functions are the same that used by Meterpreter as reflective**\n**loader method.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**On seeing the assembly code of the header, we can see the multiples**\n**operation for parse by the stack pointer for load the export section which**\n**content the Meterpreter shellcode.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**We can note the characteristic entrypoint of Cobalt Strike with the three**\n**accepts calls and one close socket.**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**We can observe the SMB pipe used as pivoting method for the implant to**\n**run.**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n0x18000a7be lea r8, [rbx + 8]\n0x18000a7c2 lea r9, str.s__pipe___s ; 0x180023a08\n0x18000a7c9 lea rdx, [rbx + 9]\n0x18000a7cd mov rcx, rax\n0x18000a7d0 mov qword [rsp + 0x28], r14\n0x18000a7d5 mov qword [rsi], rax\n0x18000a7d8 mov qword [rsp + 0x20], r15\n0x18000a7dd call fcn.180015054\n0x18000a7e2 mov rcx, qword [rsi + 8]\n0x18000a7e6 mov ebx, 0x57   ; 'W' ; 87\n0x18000a7eb lea rax, [rcx - 1]\n0x18000a7ef cmp rax, 0xfffffffffffffffd\n0x18000a7f3 ja 0x18000a812\n0x18000a7f5 lea rdx, [rsp + 0x450]\n0x18000a7fd xor r9d, r9d\n0x18000a800 xor r8d, r8d\n0x18000a803 mov dword [rsp + 0x450], edi\n0x18000a80a call qword [SetNamedPipeHandleState] ; 0x1800233f8 ; BOOL\nSetNamedPipeHandleState(HANDLE hNamedPipe, LPDWORD lpMode, LPDWORD\nlpMaxCollectionCount, LPDWORD lpCollectDataTimeout)\n0x18000a810 jmp 0x18000a84b\n\n```\n**This collects the system informations and format for send it the previous**\n**node.**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n0x180007ff7 lea rcx, [rsp + 0x40]\n0x180007ffc mov edx, 0x104  ; 260\n0x180008001 call qword [GetSystemDirectoryW] ; 0x1800232a0 ; UINT\nGetSystemDirectoryW(LPWSTR lpBuffer, UINT uSize)\n0x180008007 test eax, eax\n0x180008009 je 0x1800080ba\n0x18000800f lea edx, [rsi + 0x5c]\n0x180008012 lea rcx, [rsp + 0x40]\n0x180008017 mov dword [rsp + 0x480], 0x104 ; 260\n0x180008022 call fcn.180015078\n0x180008027 mov dword [rsp + 0x38], esi\n0x18000802b mov qword [rsp + 0x30], rsi\n0x180008030 lea r9, [rsp + 0x488]\n0x180008038 lea rcx, [rsp + 0x40]\n0x18000803d xor r8d, r8d\n0x180008040 xor edx, edx\n0x180008042 mov qword [rsp + 0x28], rsi\n0x180008047 mov word [rax + 2], si\n0x18000804b mov qword [rsp + 0x20], rsi\n0x180008050 call qword [GetVolumeInformationW] ; 0x1800232b0 ; BOOL\nGetVolumeInformationW(LPCWSTR lpRootPathName, LPWSTR lpVolumeNameBuffer,\nDWORD nVolumeNameSize, LPDWORD lpVolumeSerialNumber, LPDWORD\nlpMaximumComponentLength, LPDWORD lpFileSystemFlags, LPWSTR\nlpFileSystemNameBuffer, DWORD nFileSystemNameSize)\n0x180008056 lea rdx, [rsp + 0x480]\n0x18000805e lea rcx, [rsp + 0x250]\n0x180008066 call qword [GetComputerNameW] ; 0x1800232b8 ; BOOL\nGetComputerNameW(LPWSTR lpBuffer, LPDWORD nSize)\n0x18000806c mov ecx, dword [rsp + 0x488]\n0x180008073 lea r8, [rsp + 0x250]\n0x18000807b movzx eax, cx\n0x18000807e mov qword [rsp + 0x30], r8\n0x180008083 shr ecx, 0x10\n0x180008086 mov edx, 0x104  ; 260\n0x18000808b mov dword [rsp + 0x28], eax\n0x18000808f mov dword [rsp + 0x20], ecx\n0x180008093 lea rcx, [rsp + 0x40]\n0x180008098 lea r9, str.04x__04x:_s ; 0x180023940 ; Format the data \n0x18000809f lea r8d, [rdx - 1]\n\n```\n**Looking at the TTPs and the anomaly on the PE header, I make the**\n**parallel with the APT chimera report, a group that targeted the semi-**\n**conductor sector in Taiwan. I had written the Yara rule with the full part of**\n**the anomaly and posted on Twitter.**\n\n### Hunting\n\n**Few times after release a compact analysis, I think to use my Yara rule for**\n**hunting additionals samples with differents levels on condition, for detect**\n**if by example, a new variant reuse a part of the indicators (which can be**\n**the oldest or more recent). By the way of improving this specter of results**\n**and reduce the load on the Yara rule, I have removed a part of the**\n**anomaly just before the manipulation of the RSP (stack pointer)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Due to the numbers of results, I had only got last month of hits on**\n**Virustotal but quickly some different types of Cobalt Strike are identified**\n**in two major famillies :**\n\nWith the standard ReflectiveLoader reference in export table.\nHave not the reference but use custom way by ordinal or execute\nfunction.\n\n**The last one has been splited between recent (2019-2020) and old (2017-**\n**2018) for links to the period of samples analyzed on the chimera report**\n**(maybe a variant not analysed).**\n\n**The first result in the compiled the informations on the samples in the**\n**different groups, show that multiple pairs of samples can observed with**\n**the same VHash, date of compilation of the DLL and size of the files.**\n**VHash being based on imports, exports and the header for the PE, this**\n**insensitive unlike a simple modification of an IP address of a payload and**\n**allow to confirm that reuse the code.**\n\n**Now, this the time that each analyst hate, the time to found the samples**\n**(Ask to Virustotal theirs prices for get the samples and cry). Fortunately,**\n\n\n-----\n\n**almost a sample of each pair could be found on the public sandbox (36**\n**samples on 74).**\n\n**At the first sample analysed, the sample content the same combo Cobalt**\n**Strike and Meterpreter but have a persistence method by .NET client by**\n**local IP, localhost (in the infrastructure) or with an external IP or domain**\n**(initial compromisation point).**\n\n**In searching in the archives that match with the TTPs and the strings, I**\n**found the Yara rule of APT19 that use a combo Cobalt Strike +**\n**Meterpreter as implant for pivoting the infrastructure of the victim.**\n\n**This uses an well-known fileless UAC bypass using Event Viewer**\n**technique and maintain the persistence in the key, this spawn a**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Meterpreter instance in loading the DLL inside the beacon, we can**\n**recognize the part for initiating the communication in getting the system**\n**informations.**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**But now this beginning to become interesting, in comparing the both PE,**\n**we can observe a lot of differences on the structures of the payload due**\n**to the comparison is between each byte on the sequence order but the**\n**structure have common bytes in the anomaly in the header path.**\n\n**We can see the differences on the implementation of the stack pointer in**\n**using destination index for copy the data of the instructions for load the**\n**shellcode of the Meterpreter DLL.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**After this I have created a little script for extract each first part of PE**\n**header (4D 5A to 00 00 00 0E), get all unique the signature, attribute an ID**\n**to the signature an this time, attribute all the ID generated to the samples**\n**that have the same signature for display pairs of samples with the same**\n**modifications. On the results, we note all the samples have splited in two**\n**sections in having the same similarities in the header of the PE (here on**\n**the samples with content the ReflectiveLoader reference).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**By seeing the comparison between several samples of the same pair, we**\n**can note a code reuse at 98% between each sample, only the 2% which**\n**remains are due to the declaration or not of the IP address or domain for**\n**the pivot. This explains by the fact of the sample as compiled at the same**\n**time or use the same template like Cobalt Strike is a template that can be**\n**edited for use a custom DLL to load. Here on a pair of the Chimera**\n**samples :**\n\n**Same result on a pair of the APT19 samples :**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Liking said previously only the configuration change but the rest is the**\n**same due to this build on a template.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Few times after the report of APT19, the group have deleted the export**\n**reference in using ordinal way used for allow to use the beacon of Cobalt**\n**Strike with a custom DLL. This has by example rename as \"execute\".**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The group use this way only for changing the static reference in the**\n**export table but kept the Meterpreter DLL as implant to run.**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Some samples tagged as APT 19 have the EICAR-TEST string to suggest**\n**a detection of a test software for the SOC managers of the targeted**\n**companies.We must not forget that if now this technique can be trival and**\n**should be notified to fight against distraction measures towards the**\n**detection of the tool, in 2016 - 2017, it isn't so well known and was very**\n**effective during the pentests so for APT, I'll let you guess.**\n\n**The most recent samples on the same family of APT 19 hide theirs**\n**references to the ReflectiveLoader reference in going to the Ordinal way**\n**for the custom DLL few time after have been reported by Threat**\n**Intelligences companies on theirs reports.The most recent Chimera**\n**samples have done the same modification since 1st August 2020 in using**\n**External domain or IP, Internal IP or localhost for have an elevated**\n**session like on Active Directory machines.**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nhttps://112.213.98.44:8443/yolZSbt0qhZjjGKOPOXInwsGAF4fhug_DJWthkcIw248sAYaksYdEMF9AfLWAxNLZeL0cqpKH90RWpcWyunnejAQctfyIjN9iOcA97GrOQA/\ntcp://192.168.233.129:4444\ntcp://hash-37257.portmap.io:37257\n\n```\n**Difficult to say if the both groups are the same but a lot of commons**\n**behaviour and TTPs can be observed. I estimated that more 200 samples**\n**have been detected by the Thor rule as Chimera in the last six months**\n**can be also linked to APT19 samples that detected by the common part of**\n**the anomaly on the header. On compiling all the data, we can see the**\n**common part and the little variant code but also that match with the**\n**VHash and pairs that we have detected at the beginning of the analysis.**\n\n**A list of data that can be queried is available** **[here](https://github.com/StrangerealIntel/CyberThreatIntel/blob/master/China/APT/Chimera/CSV/Database.csv)**\n\n**It should be remembered that the way groups linked to government work**\n**are sporadic groups linked only to a project like small teams. With this in**\n**mind, it is easy to recognize similarities because they are probably the**\n**same people and as soon as there is a different news, this classed as a**\n**new APT group but nobody remembers Thrip, Calypso ... that use lot**\n**similatires with APT10 or APT3 but have just a RAT or a small**\n**modification of a PE ?**\n\n\n-----\n\n### References\n\n\n-----",
