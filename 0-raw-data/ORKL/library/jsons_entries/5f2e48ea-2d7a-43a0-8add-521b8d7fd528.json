On the other hand, while the DDoS capability is in the code, Netlab says\nthey've never seen the botnet conduct any DDoS attacks, and the botnet operators seem to be have been primarily focused over the past\nmonths on growing the botnet in size.\n\nAccording to Netlab, the DDoS feature could launch attacks via vectors such as ICMP, HTTP, TCP, and UDP. But besides DDoS attacks, the\nRoboto bot that's installed on hacked Linux systems (via the Webmin flaw) can also:\n\nFunction as a reverse shell and let the attacker run shell commands on the infected host\nCollect system, process, and network info from the infected server\nUpload collected data to a remote server\nRun Linux system() commands\nExecute a file downloaded from a remote URL\nUninstall itself\n\n### Another rare P2P botnet\n\nBut there's nothing special in the above features, as many other IoT/DDoS botnets come with similar functions -- considered basic features of\nany modern botnet infrastructure.\n\nThe thing that's unique to Roboto is, however, its internal structure. Bots are organized in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, and relay commands\nthat they receive from a central command and control (C&C) server commands from one another, rather than each bot connecting to the main\nC&C.\n\nPer Netlab, most bots are zombies, relaying commands, but some are also selected to prop up the P2P network or work as scanners to search\nfor other vulnerable Webmin systems, to expand the botnet further.\n\n\n-----\n\nRoboto\n\n\nImage: Netlab\nThe P2P structure is of note because P2P-based communications are rarely seen in DDoS botnets, and the only ones known to use P2P are\n[the Hajime [1,](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hajime-worm-battles-mirai-control-internet-things) [2,](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/botnet-variants/hajime-botnet) [3,](https://securelist.com/hajime-the-mysterious-evolving-botnet/78160/) [4] and](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/ndss2019_02B-3_Herwig_slides.pdf) [Hide'N'Seek botnets.](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2018/01/new-hide-n-seek-iot-botnet-using-custom-built-peer-to-peer-communication-spotted-in-the-wild/)\n\nIf the Roboto operators don't shut down the botnet on their own, taking it down will be a very hard task. Efforts to take down the Hajime botnet\nhave failed in the past, and according to a source, the botnet is still going strong, with 40,000 infected bots on a daily average, and sometimes\npeaking at 95,000.\n\nIf Roboto will ever reach that size remains to be determined, but the botnet is not larger than Hajime, according to sources.\n\n**The world's most famous and dangerous APT (state-developed) malware**\n\n\n-----",
