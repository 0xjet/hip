Cybercrime, however, is a constant. We’ve seen that cybercriminals continue—and sometimes escalate—their activity in times of crisis. Defending against cybercriminals is a complex, ever-evolving, and never-ending challenge.\n\n But knowledge is power. For security professionals to create successful defense strategies, they need more diverse and timelier insights into the threats they are defending against. We’re proud to provide the global community with the latest in a long series of security intelligence reports. The Microsoft Digital Defense Report is a reimagining of Microsoft’s Security Intelligence Report (SIR), first published in 2005, and it brings together more insights, from more teams, across more areas of Microsoft than ever before targeting a broader audience for consumption.\n\n\nMicrosoft serves billions of customers globally,\n\nallowing us to aggregate security data from a broad\n\nand diverse spectrum of companies, organizations,\n\nand consumers. Our unique position helps us\n\ngenerate a high-fidelity picture of the current state\n\nof cybersecurity, including indicators to help us\n\npredict what attackers will do next. This picture is\n\ninformed by over 8 trillion security signals per day.\n\n\nThere are thousands of security experts across\n\n77 countries working at Microsoft, interpreting\n\nand contributing to the insights gained from our\n\nadvanced engineering and telemetry. Our security\n\nexperts include analysts, researchers, responders,\n\nengineers, and data scientists. This report draws on\n\ninsights, data, and signals from across Microsoft,\n\nincluding the cloud, endpoints, and the intelligent\n\nedge.[1] We also share lessons learned from\n\ncustomers transitioning to a fully remote workforce\n\n\nand frontline stories from our incident responders.\n\nOf course, there’s a great deal of malign activity we\n\ndon’t see, some of which is reported on by others\n\nin the industry. While the defender community at\n\nMicrosoft works hard to identify threats and keep\n\nour customers informed, the bad actors are skilled\n\nand relentless. By continually sharing insights that\n\nwe and others in the industry derive from the work\n\nwe do, we hope to empower everyone to defend the\n\nonline ecosystem more effectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Unique insights informed by trillions of signals\n\n Monthly volume and diversity of signals used by Microsoft security operations\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft invests significantly to increase and improve the knowledge we derive from our telemetry. These\n\ninvestments deliver the highly synthesized and integrated insights that we share here. The goal of this report\n\nis to help organizations understand how cybercriminals are shifting their modes of attack and the best ways\n\nto combat those attacks. We’ve approached the writing and sharing of this report in the spirit of enabling the\n\ncommunity to benefit from the insights, observations, and transparency generated by our unique mission and\n\nvantage point.\n\n###### Digital defense:\n Our 2020 focus areas\n\n2020 has brought major disruptions to both the physical and digital worlds, and these changes are also evident\n\nin the cyberthreat landscape. Certain types of attacks have escalated as cybercriminals change tactics, leveraging\n\ncurrent events to take advantage of vulnerable targets and advance their activity through new channels. Change\n\nbrings opportunity, for both attackers and defenders, and this report will focus on the threats that are most\n\nnovel and relevant to the community in this moment.\n\nLooking at the data and signals from the cross-company teams, three top-level areas came into the sharpest\n\nfocus: cybercrime, nation state threats, and the remote workforce.\n\n###### The state of cybercrime\n\nCybercrime is a business. Like any other business, there’s a need to innovate to be profitable and successful.\n\nSome types of cybercrime persist independent of economic, political, or social changes, while certain types are\n\nfueled by these changes. Cybercriminals can be found globally and have different skill sets and motivations.\n\nIn this section, we look at the complexity that Microsoft and the industry face when defending against an\n\nextremely diverse set of criminal actors and their ever-evolving tactics and techniques.\n\nA key area we address in this section is the opportunistic nature of cybercriminals as they capitalized on\n\ninterest and fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other disruptive events. As the virus spread globally,\n\ncybercriminals pivoted their lures to imitate trusted sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) and other\n\nnational health organizations, in an effort to get users to click on malicious links and attachments.\n\n\n###### Synthesized insights drawing from security and threat intel teams\n\n across Microsoft and over 8 trillion security signals per day.Diagram depicting synthesized, integrated insights drawn from a global team of security experts, massive signal depth and diversity, and cutting-edge artificial intelligence.\n\nEmail phishing in the enterprise context continues to grow and has become a dominant vector. Given the\n\nincrease in available information regarding these schemes and technical advancements in detection, the\n\ncriminals behind these attacks are now spending significant time, money, and effort to develop scams that are\n\nsufficiently sophisticated to victimize even savvy professionals. Attack techniques in phishing and business email\n\ncompromise (BEC) are evolving quickly. Previously, cybercriminals focused their efforts on malware attacks,\n\nbut they’ve shifted their focus to ransomware, as well as phishing attacks with the goal of harvesting user\n\ncredentials. Human-operated ransomware gangs are performing massive, wide-ranging sweeps of the internet,\n\nsearching for vulnerable entry points, as they “bank” access, waiting for a time that’s advantageous to\n\ntheir purpose.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe share leading indicators of where attacks might be headed next, as we provide a look into adversarial\n\nmachine learning (ML), attacks on ML systems, and why it’s so important for organizations to take steps to\n\nsecure them. We propose democratizing ML for customized anomaly detections and a scalable effort, making it\n\nubiquitous across the variety of data types.\n\nModern business systems are driven by a complex, global supply chain. In this section, we focus our\n\nobservations and recommendations for supply chain security on third-party services, open-source software, and\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) hardware, concluding with a look at changes to the regulatory landscape.\n\n###### Nation state threats\n\nNation state actors are well-funded, well-trained, and have more patience to play the ”long game,” which can\n\nmake identification of anomalous activity more difficult. Like cybercriminals, they watch their targets and change\n\ntechniques to increase their effectiveness. To protect our customers, Microsoft spends significant resources\n\nmonitoring and disrupting nation state attacks attempted on our platform. In this section, we explain the four\n\nmain approaches Microsoft employs to thwart nation state actors: technology, operations, legal action,\n\nand policy.\n\nWe also provide our analysis of the intent behind nation state threats and how to defend against them. We look\n\nat top-level trends in country-of-activity origin, targeted geographic regions, and the top nation state activity\n\ngroups detected. Interestingly, nation state activity is significantly more likely to target organizations outside of\n\nthe critical infrastructure sectors. The most frequently targeted sector has been non-governmental organizations\n\n(NGOs), such as advocacy groups, human rights organizations, nonprofit organizations, and think tanks focused\n\non public policy, international affairs, or security.\n\nWhatever the strategic objectives behind the activity, nation state actors have these common operational aims:\n\nespionage, disruption or destruction of data, and disruption or destruction of physical assets.\n\nFinally, we examine some of the most common attack techniques used by nation state actors in the past year:\n\nreconnaissance, credential harvesting, malware, and virtual private network (VPN) exploits. As an example, we\n\nsee advanced adversaries investing heavily in development of unique malware, in addition to using openly\n\navailable malicious code.\n\n\n###### Security and the remote workforce\n\nAlmost overnight, the workforce of thousands of organizations around the world became entirely remote.\n\nSchool closures forced millions of students to rapidly transition to learning from home—and added significant\n\nchallenges for parents and caretakers. Although workforces around the world, regardless of size, have been\n\ntrending toward mobility in some aspects of their operations, few companies and learning institutions were set\n\nup to operate 100% remotely. Operational tasks like software or device patching and updates had previously\n\nbeen accomplished when mobile workers routinely returned to the office, but after the COVID-19 outbreak, this\n\noption temporarily disappeared. At Microsoft, COVID-19 became a catalyst for managing a remote workforce\n\nwith immediacy and at scale.\n\nIn this chapter, we take a closer look at three important areas of consideration for an at-scale remote workforce:\n\ninfrastructure, data, and people. Architecture and infrastructure designed to support an on-premises workforce\n\nisn’t well-equipped to support fully remote workers. We explain how organizations can support a secure,\n\nremote workforce through VPN architecture and the principles of Zero Trust, and how Microsoft used Zero Trust\n\nprinciples to enable its own transition to remote work. We discuss some of the largest availability and security\n\nconcerns facing the remote workforce, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and we explore what\n\nthis means for organizational privacy and security.\n\nData protection practices continue to increase, as workforces become remote and teams collaborate on vital\n\nassets without being physically together. Correspondingly, we observe the continued increase in usage of\n\ninformation rights management to enforce policies aimed at protecting confidential information and\n\nintellectual property.\n\nFinally, we reflect on our enterprise-scale exercise in resilience and lessons learned as the world moves\n\nthrough a global pandemic and billions of individuals adapt to working, learning, and socializing from their\n\nhome environments. To some degree, the enterprise response to COVID-19 changed not only our operational\n\nprocedures but also the very vocabulary that we use to describe our reactive measures. In this section, we\n\nconsider “the extended security boundary,” “pandemic resilience,” “human infrastructure,” and ways in which\n\ntraditionally less scrutinized areas have become critical to enterprise resilience.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### How to read this report\n\nTo help you get the most out of this report, we’ve incorporated navigational elements throughout\n\nto increase readability.\n\n###### Telemetry icons These guide you to areas that show you what we’re seeing.Photograph of people working in a corporate conference room.Best practice icons: these guide you to our recommended controls.Telemetry icons: these guide you to areas that show you what we're seeing.\n\n Best practice icons These guide you to our recommended controls.\n\n Actionable learnings Located at the end of the report, these provide a summary based on industry guidance and what we’ve seen work best for Microsoft and our customers.\n\n Glossary A clarification of acronyms and terminology, located at the end of the report.\n\n Learn more Resources and references for deeper technical information and further reading are listed in each chapter.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 1\n### The state of cybercrime\n\n###### Introduction\n\n What we’re seeing\n\n In focus: Supply chain security\n\n Machine learning in security\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Introduction\n\nAMY HOGAN-BURNEY, GENERAL MANAGER, DIGITAL CRIMES UNIT\n\n###### Cybercrime is an ongoing and escalating challenge for both the public and private sectors around the globe.\n It’s no longer effective to view cybercrime solely through the lens of a specific criminal or type of crime. Rather, cybercrime is now a large and diverse enterprise, often available for sale, to commit a variety of\n attacks, such as fraud, theft, and spying. It could be financially motivated, or nation state supported, or both.\n\n\nActivity like this is possible because of a global\n\nnetwork of actors and infrastructure used to\n\nfacilitate the crime. Arrests and prosecution can\n\nbe elusive owing to the international nature and\n\nthe often-differing locations of the criminal, crime,\n\nand victim. The actions of cybercriminals are often\n\ndisguised, leveraging a crisis or major global event\n\nand the daily news cycle and relying on personal\n\nbehaviors to perpetrate a criminal act. As varied\n\nas the motivations are, so too are the number and\n\ntypes of victims: individuals, governments, industries,\n\nor corporations can be targeted.\n\nDespite sophistication and diversity of the attacks,\n\nthe methodology is often the same, whether the\n\nactors use large-scale attacks for financial gain or\n\ntargeted attacks to support geopolitical interests. A\n\nphishing email can be a massive campaign targeting\n\n\nmillions of users or a single, targeted email that\n\nrepresents a socially engineered marvel many\n\nmonths in the making. Homoglyphs, or spoofed\n\ndomains, can be used to trick victims.\n\nAn example of this usage is “Microsoft.com” and\n\n“Micr0soft.com,” where the first “o” is replaced by\n\na zero and can be easily overlooked by human\n\nreaders. This malicious domain, Micr0soft.com, can\n\nthen be used to distribute malware, steal credentials,\n\nor support a fraudulent website. That malware then\n\ncan be used to create a botnet to facilitate a DDoS\n\nattack against a bank, distribute ransomware, or\n\nsteal sensitive information about a nation’s critical\n\ninfrastructure. We look for commonalities across\n\nvarious environments and ecosystems to understand\n\nand disrupt these methods. We work to dismantle\n\nthe criminals’ infrastructure, sharing information\n\n\ngathered through the course of our investigations\n\nas appropriate. We can then offer these additional\n\ninsights to our product teams who use this\n\ninformation to provide greater protection to\n\nour customers.\n\nIn this chapter, we present what we’re seeing as the\n\nstate of cybercrime through evolving techniques in\n\nphishing and BEC, ransomware, and malware. We\n\nalso focus our observations and recommendations\n\non supply chain security. Finally, we include a deeper\n\nlook into four trends in ML.Icon representing the State of Cybercrime chapter\n\n\n-----\n\n###### What we’re seeing\n\n Cybercrime follows the contemporary issues of the day\n\nThe threat environment we face continues to evolve. Cybercriminals are creative, well-resourced, well-organized,\n\nand innovative. They move quickly to discover new threat vectors, use new exploits, and respond to new defenses.\n\nAttackers are opportunistic and will even switch lure themes daily in accordance with news cycles, as seen in\n\ncybercriminals’ use of the global COVID-19 pandemic to broadly target consumers, as well as to specifically\n\ntarget hospitals and healthcare providers.\n\n###### COVID-19-themed attacks: United StatesGraph: Total COVID-19 themed attack encounters in the United States, February through June 2020, with a peak in mid-March at around 5 and a half million.\n\nThe lack of basic security hygiene in any given ecosystem continues to enable cybercriminals to use well-known\n\nvulnerabilities—or new variants of them—to exploit their environments. They also were observed to leverage\n\nthe fear and uncertainty associated with COVID-19 with great success. While the COVID-19-themed attacks\n\nrepresent a small percentage of the total of malware we observed, our tracking of these themed attacks shows\n\nhow rapidly cybercriminals move to adapt their lures to the topics of the day.Photo depicting a person wearing a face mask and walking across a city street.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Instances of unique and total malware encounters in relation to local news events of the day, as seen in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Korea\n\n COVID-19-themed attacks:\n United States\n\n COVID-19-themed attacks:\n United Kingdom\n\n_Source: Verizon Annual Data Breach Incident Report 2020, Figure 7Graph depicting unique and total malware encounters for COVID-19-themed attacks in the United States, February to June 2020.

It’s a common understanding among defenders to “never waste a crisis” and\n\nto use the information from the crisis to help inform the investments needed. Cybercriminals share the same\n\nphilosophy; they seek to blend their well-established tactics and malware with human curiosity and our need\n\nfor information.\n\n\n###### COVID-19-themed attacks:\n South Korea\n\n_Source: Verizon Annual Data Breach Incident Report 2020, Figure 7Graph depicting unique and total malware encounters for COVID-19-themed attacks in South Korea, February to June 2020.

Our telemetry shows that\n\nChina, the United States, and Russia were hit the\n\nhardest, but every country in the world saw at least\n\none COVID-19-themed attack, with the volume of\n\nsuccessful attacks in outbreak-hit countries increasing\n\nas fear and the desire for information grew.\n\nOf course, COVID-19 was just one of the themes\n\nexploited by cybercriminals. Microsoft’s Digital\n\nCrimes Unit (DCU) continues to work with partners\n\nand proper authorities in more than 50 countries\n\nto take coordinated legal and technical steps to\n\ntake down malicious domains and URLs, and, where\n\npossible, to prosecute the individuals behind them.\n\nFor more information on COVID-19-related\n\ncybercrime, see the Nation state threats chapter of\n\nthis report.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Microsoft takes legal action against COVID-19-related](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/07/07/digital-crimes-unit-covid-19-cybercrime/)_\n_[cybercrime 2020/07/07](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/07/07/digital-crimes-unit-covid-19-cybercrime/)_\n\n_[Microsoft shares new threat intelligence, security](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2Fmicrosoft-shares-new-threat-intelligence-security-guidance-during-global-crisis%2F&data=02%7C01%7CAnne.Borozan%40microsoft.com%7C5bb9a82359244a5729f808d801ab80ce%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637261183406900866&sdata=kDUSk7k7Nj9STz5NMqGEZSCIJlvKCx7AjnqzJPegkHU%3D&reserved=0)_\n_[guidance during global crisis 2020/04/08](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2Fmicrosoft-shares-new-threat-intelligence-security-guidance-during-global-crisis%2F&data=02%7C01%7CAnne.Borozan%40microsoft.com%7C5bb9a82359244a5729f808d801ab80ce%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637261183406900866&sdata=kDUSk7k7Nj9STz5NMqGEZSCIJlvKCx7AjnqzJPegkHU%3D&reserved=0)_\n\n\n###### Relative impact of COVID-19-themed attacks across the world by file count (as of July 1, 2020)A map depicting relative impact of COVID-19-themed attacks around the world.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Phishing and business email compromise\n\nEmail phishing in the enterprise context continues to grow and has become a dominant vector. Essentially,\n\nphishing occurs when individuals or organizations receive a fraudulent email encouraging them to click on a\n\nlink, giving the cybercriminal access to a device or personal information.\n\n**From our view in Office 365 telemetry, we see customers facing three main forms of phishing:**\n\n###### 1. Credential phishing\n\nThe cybercriminal attempts to pose as a well-known service in the email template (typically Microsoft and other\n\nestablished enterprise SaaS services). They then try to lure the user into clicking on a link, which, through a\n\nseries of misdirections, will present a fake login page to the user. Once a credential has been compromised, it\n\ncan be used to launch different kill chains to build further persistence inside an organization by using cloud-only\n\nAPIs and systems, and to move around laterally to steal data, money, or otherwise breach the organization.\n\n**Example of credential phishing:**\n\nThe cybercriminals begin by setting up a criminal infrastructure designed to steal an individual’s credentials\n\n(phishing kits often contain everything they need for this). The cybercriminals send malicious email to the\n\nunsuspecting individual, who then clicks on a link within the email. The individual might then be taken to a fake\n\nweb form to enter their credentials, or the site might contain malware that’s automatically downloaded to their\n\ndevice, capturing credentials stored on the device or in the browser memory. The victim’s credentials are then\n\ncollected by the cybercriminals who use the credentials to gain access to legitimate websites or even the victim’s\n\ncorporate network. Best practice icon: our recommended controls.\n\n[Reduce risk of security breaches with strong authentication.² Strong authentication can protect your ]\n\nusers from the vast majority of identity attacks. Passwordless authentication options are recommended for\n\nbest security and user experience. Using an authenticator app is always the preferred option over SMS/voice\n\nauthentication.\n\n\n###### Credential phishing example\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2. Business email compromise (aka CEO fraud or vendor compromise)\n\nBusiness email compromise is a type of phishing that specifically targets businesses. It’s characterized by\n\ntechniques used to pose as someone who the victims will likely take notice of, such as the company CEO, CFO,\n\nor the accounts receivable clerk. BEC can also involve a business-to-business transaction. For example, the\n\ncybercriminal might fraudulently access a company’s system and then pose as that company to fraudulently\n\nrequest payment from another company.\n\nDepending on the entity that gets impersonated or spoofed, the attack can be categorized as BEC, CEO fraud, or\n\nvendor compromise.\n\nWhile the industry and vendor-specific terminology for this class of attacks has been evolving, at its core it\n\nemploys three basic patterns of a cybercriminal posing as another entity:\n\n - Cybercriminal creates an exact spoof of an established person or organization that the recipient has\n\na relationship with, and then gains trust to deliver the fraud. For example, the email comes from an\n\ninfrastructure controlled by the cybercriminal but appears to come from a legitimate person (sender address\n\nis identical).\n\n - Cybercriminal creates a look-alike impersonation of an established person or organization that the recipient\n\nhas a relationship with, and then gains trust to deliver the fraud. For example, the criminal signs up for and\n\nsends from this account: YourCompanyCEO@outlook.com.\n\n - Cybercriminal creates a look-alike domain and registers it for the sole purpose of delivering a BEC attack.\n\nFor example, instead of CEO@microsoft.com, the criminal sets up the domain micros0ft.com (number zero\n\nreplaces letter “o”) and sends email from it.\n\nAt its core, BEC is a social engineering scam. However, given the increase in available information regarding\n\nthese schemes and technical advancements in detection, the criminals behind these attacks are now spending\n\nsignificant time, money, and effort to develop scams that are sufficiently sophisticated to victimize increasingly\n\nsavvy professionals.\n\n\n###### ...the criminals behind these attacks are now spending significant time, money, and effort to develop scams that are sufficiently sophisticated to victimize increasingly savvy professionals.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3. Combination of BEC and credential phishing\n\nWe’re also seeing new attack kill chains that combine the two forms to deliver more sophisticated kill chains.\n\nThis attack can start with credential phishing. Once an account is compromised, the cybercriminal sets up\n\nmailbox “forwarding” rules to monitor for financial transactions. Often these forwarding rules include keywords\n\nsuch as “invoice,” “accounts receivable,” “funds,” “overdue,” “payroll,” or “IBAN” and send all relevant email to a\n\ncollection email account controlled and monitored by the cybercriminal. The cybercriminal then inserts a victim\n\nimpersonation email in the middle of a communication to misdirect and steal money or information.\n\n_While credential phishing and BEC continue to be the dominant variations, we also see attacks on a user’s identity_\n\nand credential being attempted via password reuse and password spray attacks using legacy email protocols\n\nsuch as IMAP and SMTP.\n\n**Example of BEC where cybercriminal masquerades as CEO:**\n\nDepending on the level of sophistication of the attack, the cybercriminals might begin by monitoring the\n\nCEO’s mail account for information such as relationships within the company, common phrases used, business\n\nactivities or travel, and especially information about payments or wire transfers. The cybercriminals might set\n\nmailbox forwarding rules using keywords such as “invoice” or “accounts receivable” so that mail containing these\n\nwords is directed to a drop email account that they control and monitor.\n\nThe cybercriminals can then send mail requesting sensitive information or payments to be made, using links\n\nor instructions to wire payment to a fraudulent bank account. Unsuspecting employees will comply with the\n\nrequests, believing the requests come from the CEO, and wire the payment to the cybercriminal’s account.\n\n\n###### Example of BEC where cybercriminal masquerades as CEO\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\n\nand the Department of Health to get into inboxes.\n\nThe trendy and pervasive Trickbot and Emotet\n\nmalware families are very active in rebranding their\n\nlures to take advantage of the outbreak. As of June\n\n30, 2020, we observed 79 threat variants globally\n\nusing COVID-19-themed lures\n\n\n**COVID-19-themed phishing luresTelemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.**\n\n[Microsoft tracks thousands of email phishing ]\n\ncampaigns that cover millions of malicious messages\n\nevery week.

Some of the DCU\n\nobservations about phishing and BEC are\n\nshared here.\n\nEmail-facilitated cybercrime, such as credential\n\nphishing for cloud services and BEC, continues to\n\nexpand in scope and complexity. According to the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as reported in\n\n[the 2019 Internet Crime Report, the Internet Crime](https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx)\n\n[Complaint Center (IC3) received nearly a half a](https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx)\n\nmillion complaints and recorded over $3.5 billion in\n\nlosses to individual and business victims. The most\n\nfrequently reported complaints involved email\nfacilitated cybercrime and the most costly involved\n\nBEC crimes. According to the IC3, BEC complaints\n\ntotaled 23,775 and accounted for losses of more\n\nthan $1.7 billion—representing nearly half of all\n\nfinancial losses owing to cybercrime.Telemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\n\n**Targeting the C-Suite**\n\nAlthough BEC scams have posed a significant\n\nthreat to businesses and individuals for many years,\n\nthese schemes continue to evolve in sophistication\n\nand reach. Early BEC schemes tended to focus\n\non spoofing or impersonating emails from CEOs\n\nor CFOs in an attempt to redirect wire transfers\n\nto fraudulent accounts controlled by criminals.\n\nCurrent BEC schemes include multiple phases\n\nand usually start with reconnaissance of targeted\n\nbusinesses prior to initiating an attack. Research\n\nby cybercriminals during the initial phase results in\n\nidentifying specific accounts to target for account\n\ncompromise through techniques like credential\n\nphishing. We’ve observed threat actors targeting\n\nC-suite, accounting, and payroll employees in these\n\ncredential phishing attacks.Telemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\n**Brand imitation continues to grow**\n\nMany credential phishing scams start by imitating\n\na well-known brand, enterprise cloud service, or\n\ngovernment entity. They require users to click on\n\na link that leads to a fake login site and lures them\n\ninto revealing their credentials. Another common\n\ntactic is to spoof trademarks from trusted brands\n\nin the phishing “lure.” It’s no surprise that well\nknown brands in banking, telecommunication,\n\nand technology are frequently spoofed to deceive\n\nrecipients. Based on our Office 365 telemetry, the\n\n\n**BEC-targeted industries**\n\nGiven the time dedicated to research and post\ncompromise reconnaissance, cybercriminals know\n\nwhich industries frequently wire large payments.\n\nBased on our BEC investigations, the top 10 most\n\ntargeted industries for BEC attacks are accounting\n\nand consulting, wholesale distribution, IT services,\n\nreal estate, education, health care, chemicals, high\n\ntech and electronics, legal services, and outsourced\n\nservices. Cybercriminals also understand business\n\nand payment cycles. As a result, DCU sees phishing\n\ncampaigns directed at specific industries and BEC\n\nattacks timed to increase the ROI.\n\n\ntop five spoofed brands are Microsoft, UPS, Amazon,\n\nApple, and Zoom. The websites that host the fake\n\nlogin pages are composed of phishing kits deployed\n\nby cybercriminals. For instance, there’s a “Microsoft”\nbranded phishing kit that “advises” recipients that\n\nthey’ve received a voicemail. Each phishing kit also\n\nincludes a “drop account,” or email account set up by\n\nthe criminal to receive credentials provided by the\n\nunsuspecting victim. There are literally thousands of\n\ndifferent phishing kits sold on the dark web today.\n\nDCU routinely analyzes these kits to develop insights\n\nto thwart ongoing and future credential harvesting\n\nand BEC campaigns targeting our customers.\n\n\n###### Top 5 spoofed brands\n\n Microsoft\n\n UPS\n\n Amazon\n\n Apple\n\n ZoomTelemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\n\n###### Top 10 targeted industries\n\n for BEC attacks\n\n Accounting & Consulting\n\n Wholesale Distribution\n\n IT Services\n\n Real Estate\n\n Education\n\n Healthcare\n\n Chemicals\n\n High Tech & Electronics\n\n Legal Services\n\n Outsourced Services\n\n\n-----\n\n**Our strategy**\n\nGiven the enormity and complexity of the credential\n\nphishing and BEC issue, the DCU, together with\n\nsecurity engineering teams across Microsoft, is\n\nexecuting a strategy focused on four functions:\n\ndisrupt, deter, strengthen, and communicate.\n\n**Disrupt: The disrupt function is to analyze and map**\n\nthe technical infrastructure utilized by cybercriminals\n\nto launch BEC attacks. The infrastructure includes\n\nphishing URLs, phishing kits, collection accounts,\n\ndrop accounts, and homoglyph domains. DCU takes\n\naction to take down these aspects of the criminal\n\ntechnical infrastructure through established notice\n\nand take-down procedures or through judicial\n\nintervention. Comprehensive disruption mitigates\n\nthe likelihood of successful BEC attacks and\n\nincreases the cost to cybercriminals, reducing the\n\nROI and incentive for cybercrime.

Determining what areas of\n\nbehavior are driven by a lack of knowledge will best\n\nbe addressed with a “training first” approach. Areas\n\nwhere employees have the knowledge but are still\n\nnot displaying desired security behaviors should\n\nbe addressed through other efforts, like targeted\n\ncampaigns, leadership messaging, outreach events,\n\nand a closer look at process and procedures. This is\n\nwhy telemetry—and knowing what to measure—is\n\nso critical to the effectiveness of a program.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransomware: A high-impact, human-driven threat\n\nHistorically, cyberattacks were seen as a sophisticated set of actions targeting particular industries, which left\n\nthe remaining industries believing they were outside the scope of cybercrime, and without context about which\n\ncybersecurity threats they should prepare for. Ransomware represents a major shift in this threat landscape,\n\nand it’s made cyberattacks a very real and omnipresent danger for everyone. Encrypted and lost files and\n\nthreatening ransom notes have now become the top-of-mind fear for most executive teams.\n\n###### INTERPOL issued a warning to organizations at the forefront\n of the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak because they’ve also\n become targets of ransomware attacks designed to lock them out\n\n\nactors are using open-source tools like Cobalt Strike,\n\nMimiKatz, ProcessHacker, and LaZagne to initiate the\n\nattack that ultimately delivers ransomware payload.\n\nThe malware used in these incidents is usually\n\ndelivered through spear phishing or by exploiting\n\npublic-facing applications.\n\n**Human-operated ransomware**\n\nHuman-operated ransomware is sometimes referred\n\nto as “big game ransomware,” a term that implies\n\ncybercriminals select specific networks for their\n\nvalue proposition and then hunt for entry vectors.\n\nThis approach has been the exception, not the rule,\n\nin most major ransomware attacks in the past year.\n\nCybercriminals perform massive wide-ranging sweeps\n\nof the internet, searching for vulnerable entry points.\n\nOr they enter networks via “commodity” trojans and\n\nthen “bank” this access for a time and purpose that’s\n\nadvantageous to them. For example, cybercriminals\n\nused Dridex (a strain of banking malware that\n\nleverages macros in Microsoft Office) to gain initial\n\naccess to networks, and then ransomed a subset of\n\nthem with the DoppelPaymer ransomware during the\n\n2019 Christmas holiday season. As another example,\n\ncybercriminals exploited vulnerabilities in VPN and\n\nremote access devices to gain credentials, and then\n\nsaved their access to use for ransoming hospitals and\n\nmedical providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn these attacks, the cybercriminals actively make\n\ndecisions as they go, controlling each attack step\n\nbased on the configurations they encounter in the\n\nnetwork. They decide which data to exfiltrate, which\n\n\n###### of their critical systems in an attempt to extort payments.\n\n\n_4_\n\n\nRansomware’s economic model capitalizes on the misperception that a ransomware attack is solely a malware\n\nincident, whereas in reality ransomware is a breach involving human adversaries attacking a network.\n\nFor many organizations, the cost to rebuild from scratch after a ransomware incident far outweighs the original\n\nransom demanded. With a limited understanding of the threat landscape and how ransomware operates, paying\n\nthe ransom seems like the better business decision to return to operations. However, the real damage is often\n\ndone when the cybercriminal exfiltrates files for release or sale, while leaving backdoors in the network for future\n\ncriminal activity—and these risks persist whether or not the ransom is paid.\n\n\n###### Paying a ransom\n doesn’t remove the attacker\n\nThe rise in popularity of ransomware—and its\n\nsubsequent rise in fame—has led to a cybersecurity\n\nnarrative that focuses on the intricacies of the\n\nransomware payload itself and the novelty of\n\nencryption methods utilized. This makes it seem\n\nas if the ransomware were appearing on networks\n\nthrough characteristics of the malware and that\n\ndefenses should focus on preventing encryption.\n\nHowever, this approach often fails to address the\n\nroot problem because it ignores the human actors\n\nbehind the threat, the specificity of their targets,\n\nand that access to their networks might already be\n\ncompromised.\n\nUnderstanding and fixing the fundamental security\n\nissues that led to the compromise in the first place\n\nshould be a priority for ransomware victims. Telemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\nMicrosoft’s Detection and Response Team\n\n(DART) engages with customers around the world,\n\nhelping to protect and harden against attacks before\n\nthey occur, as well as investigating and remediating\n\nwhen an attack has occurred. DART has observed\n\nthat ransomware continues to be the most common\n\nreason behind our incident response engagements\n\nfrom October 2019 through July 2020. More threat\n\n\n-----\n\npersistence mechanisms to use for future access to\n\nthe network, and ultimately, they even decide which\n\nransomware payload to deliver. This scenario is far\n\nfrom a commodity or automated threat. Microsoft\n\nrefers to this class of attacks as “human-operated\n\nransomware” to reflect the current threat landscape\n\nmore accurately.\n\nRansomware attacks are often described in terms\n\nof their payload. However, Microsoft has observed\n\nmultiple ransomware payloads being deployed by\n\ncybercriminals using the same infrastructure for\n\nconcurrent campaigns. The selection of which payload\n\nand tools used was largely dependent on the terrain\n\nthe cybercriminals landed in; choices were based on\n\nwhich security tools were present, whether the network\n\nhad good cybersecurity basics in place, and which data\n\nthe cybercriminals wanted to exfiltrate from\n\nthe network.\n\nPayloads can also be varied by cybercriminals to avoid\n\nattribution. If a certain ransomware has been reported\n\nin the news and there’s heightened awareness of\n\nit, switching to a different payload (and sometimes\n\njust ransom note) can reduce the pressure on\n\ncybercriminals and their concern about the possibility\n\nof getting disrupted. In April 2020, Microsoft observed\n\na prolific ransomware criminal responsible for more\n\nthan 100 major incidents suddenly switch to using\n\nthe infamous WannaCrypt payload at the end of their\n\ntypical attack pattern, after attacking hospitals and\n\nhealthcare organizations during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\nRansomware criminals are intimately familiar with\n\nsystems management concepts and the struggles IT\n\ndepartments face. Attack patterns demonstrate that\n\ncybercriminals know when there will be change freezes,\n\nsuch as holidays, that will impact an organization’s\n\nability to make changes (such as patching) to harden\n\ntheir networks. They’re aware of when there are\n\nbusiness needs that will make businesses more willing\n\nto pay ransoms than take downtime, such as during\n\nbilling cycles in the health, finance, and legal industries.\n\nTargeting networks where critical work was needed\n\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, and also specifically\n\nattacking remote access devices during a time when\n\nunprecedented numbers of people were working\n\nremotely, are examples of this level of knowledge.\n\nOnce inside a network, this proficiency in\n\nunderstanding protective and detective controls\n\ncontinues to contribute to the success of the\n\ncybercriminals. Through reconnaissance they’ll select\n\nmachines with no or poorly configured antivirus\n\nsoftware to perform most of their actions, modifying\n\ntheir techniques if they sense they might be detected.\n\nUnfortunately, there are also numerous examples of\n\nsituations where cybercriminals simply performed\n\ntheir attacks as they wished, with poor cyber hygiene\n\nleaving no blocking controls in their way. This can\n\nhappen in spite of multiple stages of their attack\n\ncausing detections in antivirus and endpoint detection\n\nand response products, signifying cybercriminals’\n\nunderstanding of the challenges modern IT\n\ndepartments and SOCs face in rapidly triaging and\n\n\n###### In some instances, cybercriminals went from initial entry to ransoming the entire network in less than 45 minutes.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile human-operated ransomware campaigns vary in\n\ntheir tools and ultimate choice of ransomware payload,\n\nall of them need to operate in a similar manner to\n\neffectively enter a network and move laterally to\n\nachieve their goals. While initial entry vectors can\n\nvary, such as through unpatched vulnerabilities, the\n\nbiggest factor leading to success in moving through\n\nmultiple systems and deploying ransomware is\n\nthe cybercriminal’s ability to gain access to highly\n\nprivileged account credentials. Cybercriminals rely on\n\noff-the-shelf tools used for systems administration\n\nor security testing and built-in tools to move from\n\nmachine to machine, but they need administrative\n\ncredentials, such as those of a domain administrator,\n\nto gain access. To deploy ransomware across an\n\nentire organization, cybercriminals must capture a\n\ncredential and a system with the rights to do this.\n\nDomain administrator accounts are often used for\n\ntheir ability to utilize Active Directory policies and file\n\nshares intended for software distribution to maliciously\n\ndeploy devastating ransomware payloads.\n\n###### Over 70% of human-operated ransomware attacks in the past\n year originated with Remote\n Desktop Protocol (RDP)\n\n\nBy narrowing the focus for IT departments to the\n\noverlapping techniques used by attackers regardless\n\nof which payload they deploy, defensive strategies can\n\nbe moved from a reactionary detection-only option,\n\nwhich changes with every variation in ransomware,\n\nto simple steps that provide significant ROI across\n\nmultiple classes of attacks.\n\nLearn more:\n\n_[Human-operated ransomware attacks: A preventable](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/)_\n_[disaster 2020/03/05](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/)_\n\n_[Ransomware groups continue to target healthcare,](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/28/ransomware-groups-continue-to-target-healthcare-critical-services-heres-how-to-reduce-risk/)_\n_[critical services; here’s how to reduce risk 2020/04/28](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/28/ransomware-groups-continue-to-target-healthcare-critical-services-heres-how-to-reduce-risk/)_\n\n\n###### Ransomware operations attack pattern detail observed by Microsoft Threat Protection intelligence in early 2020.

This so-called alert fatigue is a\n\nhuge factor in organizations not being able to\n\nrespond quickly and accurately enough to security\n\nincidents—a factor cybercriminals are acutely\n\naware of. When faced with deciding which alerts\n\nto prioritize, many SOCs will prioritize threats\n\nperceived as targeted (such as nation state–related\n\nthreats) over those which are “commodity,” a term\n\nused to describe malware that isn’t customized or\n\nintended for use on specific targeted networks.\n\nThis assumption that commodity threats are less\n\nimpactful to a business, combined with the security\n\nindustry’s naming convention for threats, leads to\n\nconfusion that cybercriminals of all skill sets will\n\nuse to their advantage. From nation state attackers\n\nutilizing off-the-shelf tools intended for Red Teams\n\nto major criminal operations pivoting their behaviors\n\nin well-known malware families, the desire to blend\n\nin and not be remediated has turned some of these\n\nassumptions upside down. Nowhere was this more\n\nimpactful in the past year than in the category of\n\nbanking trojans.\n\n\nJudging malware by its family or detection name is a\n\nlot like judging a book by its cover—it might not tell\n\nyou what the malware is capable of. Banking trojans,\n\nintended to steal credentials from online banking\n\nand finance sites, have been a consistent threat in\n\nthe landscape over the past decade. The nature\n\nof many banking trojans was always modular and\n\nextensible, with additional modules and capabilities\n\ndeployed or downloaded after the initial infection. In\n\nthe past few years, the potential of this capability for\n\nattacks against enterprise environments, where the\n\nbanking trojan malware might not be immediately\n\ntriaged or removed, was realized with devastating\n\nsuccess by several major banking trojans. The two\n\nbanking trojans most infamous for adopting this\n\nnew model are Emotet and Trickbot.\n\nOriginally intended to steal banking data,\n\ncomponents in Emotet and Trickbot reporting IP\n\naddresses and DNS ranges back to the operators\n\nrevealed just how many major networks their\n\nmalware was installed on and checking in from. In\n\nearly efforts to capitalize on this network access,\n\nteam-ups of malware payloads were seen. Examples\n\ninclude Emotet’s leading to Trickbot infections that\n\nutilized the Eternal Blue vulnerability for lateral\n\nmovement and Emotet’s downloading second\nstage trojans with credential theft capabilities such\n\nas Qakbot or IceID. This piggybacking has led to\n\ndisastrous results for organizations, as these\n\n\n###### Trickbot banking trojan prevalence, April 2020 Global map depicting Trickbot banking trojan prevalence.\n\n\n-----\n\nsecond-stage malware payloads used brute force\n\nattacks against Active Directory passwords, causing\n\nmassive downtime and network outages. Trickbot\n\nreached the most devastating stage in this evolution\n\nin 2019 when the operators began to utilize the\n\nTrickbot install base to deploy the Ryuk ransomware.\n\nTaking advantage of Trickbot’s prevalent install base,\n\noperators select networks that seem valuable and\n\nadvantageous to them at the time: the ones that\n\nwill pay a high ransom or have interesting data.\n\nThey then use the Trickbot implant to download\n\nadditional tools, such as Cobalt Strike, and transform\n\ninto a human-operated ransomware campaign.\n\n\nBanking trojans have succeeded by being\n\nunderestimated and by using their breadth of\n\ninfections to their advantage, selectively targeting\n\nnetworks for follow-on ransomware, data\n\nexfiltration, or sale of access on the dark web.\n\nOrganizations can help with alert fatigue and\n\nbombardments of similar threats by focusing on the\n\nbehaviors of the malware and delivery mechanisms,\n\nand by mitigating the issues that allow entry into\n\ntheir networks.

Supply chain attacks are particularly insidious because they take advantage of the trust that\n users and organizations place in the hardware, software, and third-party services they use.\n\nThe increased number of supply chain attacks over the past few years has become an important topic in many cybersecurity conversations and is a growing\n\nsource of concern across the global supply chain. The past 12 months have been an unprecedented time of focus on supply chain security, given the\n\nacceleration of interdependencies resulting from changes in global remote workforces in response to COVID-19, as well as new and evolving regulations\n\nin the United States and Europe.\n\nIn this section, we focus our observations and recommendations for supply chain security on third-party services, open-source software, and IoT\n\nhardware and conclude with a look at changes to the regulatory landscape.\n\n###### Third-party services\n\n\n###### DART incident response initial attack vector\n (June 2019–March 2020) Graph depicting supply chain compromise as 7 percent of initial attack vectors as seen by the detection and response team.\n\n\nThrough its engagements in assisting customers\n\nwho have been victims of cybersecurity intrusions,\n\nthe Microsoft Detection and Response Team has\n\nobserved an uptick in supply chain attacks between\n\nJuly 2019 and March 2020. These attacks include\n\ntargeting IT service providers to get a foothold in\n\ntheir customers’ systems. Although there was an\n\nincrease, supply chain attacks represented a relatively\n\nsmall percentage of DART engagements overall.\n\nAs organizations grant widespread administrative\n\nor system access to external entities, managed\n\n\nservice providers (MSPs) and IT outsourcers become\n\nhigh-value targets for attackers. All too often, IT\n\noutsourcers or MSPs aren’t threat modeled with\n\nthe same diligence as internal systems. Over the\n\npast year, there have been numerous high-profile\n\ncompromises of MSPs to deliver ransomware,\n\nexfiltrate data, or provide financial gain to attackers\n\nin some way. These attacks follow a common\n\npattern of entering the service provider’s network\n\nvia phishing email or through a network weakness\n\nwith RDP brute force, and then moving laterally to\n\ngain administrative privileges. Once the attackers\n\n\nhave gained full access to the service provider, they\n\ncan access the customers via the same legitimate\n\nsupport channels and accounts used for remote\n\nsupport or software maintenance.Best practice icon: our recommended controls.\n\n[To limit the risk of attack, organizations should ]\n\nvet their service providers to ensure they follow\n\nbest practices for least privilege access on accounts\n\nand services.

We apply security controls to\n\nthe software itself, vetting it by using a combination\n\nof automated tools and manual processes before\n\nallowing it to be used in a product or service.\n\nModern software projects are heavily dependent\n\non open-source software, from operating systems\n\nto widgets, and from back-end data analysis to\n\nfront-end user interfaces. There are well over 2\n\nmillion[9] open-source components available for\n\ndevelopers to use, and according to the GitHub\n\n[State of the Octoverse report (2019), the average](https://octoverse.github.com/)\n\nsoftware project depends on more than 200 other\n\ncomponents. Open-source software has provided\n\ngreat benefits, allowing developers to focus more\n\non building software applications and less on\n\nreinventing common components.\n\nHowever, this pervasiveness has attracted the\n\nattention of attackers, who in recent years have\n\n\nincreasingly turned their focus to the open-source\n\nsoftware supply chain. While traditional security\n\nvulnerabilities have always affected the software\n\nsupply chain, attackers can now target an ecosystem\n\nimpacting multiple users at once, with more\n\ndamaging results. For example:\n\n - An attacker hijacks the account of the publisher\n\nof a popular package and publishes a malicious\n\n[update, such as in the case of the npm bb-](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n\nbuilder package, which was discovered a year\n\n[after it was compromised. Unfortunately, only](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/npm-pulls-malicious-package-that-stole-login-passwords/)\n\n12.84% of GitHub accounts and 9.3% of npm\n\nmaintainers use MFA to protect their accounts,\n\nwhich is one of the most effective ways to\n\nmitigate the risk of account takeover. Thankfully,\n\nthis percentage is higher for well-established\n\nopen-source projects: 52% of maintainers\n\nhave enabled two-factor authentication for\n\nopen-source projects with more than 100\n\ncontributors.\n\n - An attacker publishes a package with a name\n\nsimilar to a popular package and waits for some\n\ndevelopers to accidentally type the wrong package\n\nname (known as “typosquatting”), obtaining the\n\nattacker’s malicious version. Examples include\n\n[the python3-dateutil PyPI module and the](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-malicious-python-libraries-removed-from-pypi/)\n\n[725 malicious packages from the RubyGems](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/mining-for-malicious-ruby-gems)\n\necosystem that mined crypto-currency.\n\n\n\n - An attacker publishes a malicious package\n\nand waits for developers to install and use\n\n[it. Examples include the npm 1337qq-js and](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-spots-malicious-npm-package-stealing-data-from-unix-systems/)\n\n[m-backdoor modules.](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1513)\n\n - An attacker finds credentials, API keys, or other\n\nsecrets that were accidentally published by an\n\nopen-source project author.

At the center of this program is a system\n\nthat automatically identifies open-source software\n\ncomponents and performs certain checks to ensure\n\nthey’re free of known security defects. This is an\n\nessential first step to using open-source safely. It\n\nenables us to accurately identify the right open\nsource components to use and understand whether\n\nthey contain vulnerabilities. It’s important that\n\nthis process be automated as much as possible.\n\nFortunately, there are many tools, commercial and\n\nopen source, that can help, including GitHub’s\n\nDependency Graph and Dependabot alerts. On top\n\nof this, we add processes for manually reviewing\n\n\ncritical open-source packages and scanning\n\nmillions of open-source components for signs of\n\ncompromise.\n\nTelemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.

Avoid**\n\nexposure or create custom access controls to limit exposure. This is true\n\nof incoming and outgoing network controls to protect against intrusion\n\nand exfiltration.\n\n**Map the digital terrain.** Create a current map of your network and\n\nall the IoT/OT devices connected to it. Understand how devices are\n\ncommunicating with each other and other parts of your corporate\n\nnetwork.\n\n**Focus on mitigating risk for your “crown jewel” processes. Use**\n\nthreat modeling (via automated attack simulation techniques, Red\n\nTeaming, and/or tabletop exercises) to predict the most likely paths\n\nadversaries would take to compromise your most critical or “crown\n\njewel” processes. These are the processes in which compromise\n\nwould cause major financial impact owing to production downtime,\n\nmajor safety incidents, or theft of intellectual property. Then focus on\n\nmitigating risk to those specific attack paths by addressing configuration\n\nerrors, patching, network segmentation, or compensating controls such\n\nas continuous network security monitoring.\n\n\n**Implement Zero Trust IoT/OT strategies. Use a separate or segmented**\n\nnetwork for IoT and OT devices. Consider more granular segmentation\n\npolicies within the OT network itself, across multiple layers of the Purdue\n\nmodel. Audit and revalidate identities and credentials with authorized\n\naccess to IoT devices, users, and processes.\n\n**Require approval and cataloging of any IoT/OT devices. Implement a**\n\npolicy for all devices running in your environment.\n\n**Centralize asset/configuration/patch management. Conduct routine**\n\nasset discovery and configuration/patch audits against deployed IoT and\n\nOT devices.\n\n**Remove IT/OT silos. Modern attacks often cross IT/OT boundaries. For**\n\nexample, in the TRITON attack on the safety systems in a petrochemical\n\nfacility, the adversary compromised OT remote access credentials from a\n\nWindows system on the IT network before pivoting to the OT network.\n\nAdditionally, it’s not always clear who’s responsible for the security of the\n\nOT network—is it the IT security organization, the OT organization, or\n\nvarious third-party organizations that manage and maintain automation\n\nequipment in these facilities? Ensure the lines of responsibility are\n\nclear, and also that the corporate SOC has continuous visibility into\n\npotential OT security threats—via their security information and event\n\nmanagement (SIEM)/Security Orchestration, Automation and Response\n\n(SOAR) system—so they can quickly detect multistage IT/OT attacks and\n\nstop them before they cause harm.\n\n\n**Continuously monitor for unusual or unauthorized behavior. It’s no**\n\nlonger sufficient to rely on static indicators of compromise to detect\n\nattacks. Adversaries are increasingly using “living off the land” tactics in\n\nthe OT domain, just as in the IT domain. This change in strategy requires\n\nvigilant monitoring for unusual or unauthorized behavior such as new\n\nremote access connections, code or configuration changes made to\n\nprogrammable logic controllers, printers browsing SharePoint sites, or\n\neven new devices being connected to the network for the first time.\n\n**Plan for incident response. Define policies for isolation of IoT and OT**\n\ndevices, preservation of device data, ability to maintain logs of device\n\ntraffic, and capture of device images for forensic investigation.\n\n**Don’t forget third parties. If your devices are deployed/managed by**\n\na third party, include explicit terms in your contracts detailing security\n\npractices to be followed and audits that report security status and\n\nhealth of all managed devices. Ensure third parties are using secure\n\nremote access (VPNs, strong authentication, and rotating passwords) to\n\naccess your network. Where possible, define service-level terms in IoT\n\nand OT device vendor contracts that set a mutually acceptable window\n\nfor investigative response and forensic analysis to any compromise\n\ninvolving their product.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Create a manageable OT Windows upgrade schedule. IIoT/OT**\n\nsystems are typically more difficult to upgrade than corporate IT\n\nsystems. Many IoT/OT networks run 24x7 and have limited maintenance\n\nwindows. Windows systems often host legacy OT applications that\n\nwould need to be extensively tested or rewritten after an upgrade.\n\nFood and Drug Administration–validated systems in the pharmaceutical\n\nindustry require a new cycle of validation after being upgraded.\n\nWhile creating a software and hardware upgrade schedule is more\n\ndifficult for OT than it is for IT, it isn’t impossible given the appropriate\n\ntop-down management attention and resources. The inescapable truth\n\nis that no matter how difficult they are to upgrade, legacy Windows\n\nsystems introduce risk to your organization’s people, production,\n\nand profits.\n\nIf you can’t update your Windows systems, ensure you’re aware of all\n\nlegacy Windows systems in your facilities and implement compensating\n\ncontrols such as continuous monitoring to quickly detect when they’re\n\nbeing targeted.\n\n\n**Secure your OT Windows endpoints. In the past, automation vendors**\n\nprohibited end-user organizations from deploying endpoint security\n\ncontrols such as antivirus protection on their systems, but this situation\n\nhas changed. Ensure your OT Windows endpoints are running modern\n\nendpoint protection controls to quickly detect malware and prevent\n\nunauthorized applications from running.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[CyberX Global 2020 IoT/ICS Risk Report](https://cyberx-labs.com/resources/risk-report-2020/)_\n\n_[US CISA/NSA Alert 2020/07/23](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-205a)_\n\n_[Staying safe and smart in the Internet of Things era 2020/05/14](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/05/14/stay-smart-safely-connected-iot/)_\n\n_[Cyber Tech Accord](https://cybertechaccord.org/iot-security/)_\n\n_[Azure IoT security](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/security/)_\n\n_[Corporate IoT: A path to intrusion 2019/08/05](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/05/corporate-iot-a-path-to-intrusion/)_\n\n_[Microsoft logistics team gains supply chain visibility using Azure IoT](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/777252-microsoft-consumer-goods-azure)_\n_[Central 2020/01/11](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/777252-microsoft-consumer-goods-azure)_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Evolving regulations to manage supply chain risk\n\n\nGenerally, a good supply chain risk management\n\nstrategy is a coordinated, organization-wide effort\n\nto identify, monitor, detect, and mitigate threats to\n\nsupply chain continuity and profitability.

At the same time, it’s becoming an invaluable tool in\n\ncombatting cybercrime. Here are four trends to consider when defending against attacks on ML systems, and in\n\nusing ML to defend against alert fatigue and make threat detection more effective and efficient.\n\n###### Preparing your industry for attacks on machine learning systems\n\n\nAdversarial machine learning, the name given to\n\nefforts to attack ML systems, is a growing reality\n\n[in the software industry. Google,[13] Microsoft,[14]](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/?category=security)\n\n[and IBM[15] have signaled—separate from their](https://ibm.co/36fhajg )\n\ncommitment to securing their traditional software\n\nsystems—specific initiatives to secure their ML\n\nsystems.\n\nIn February 2019, Gartner, the leading industry\n\nmarket research firm, published its first report\n\n[on adversarial machine learning,[16] advising that](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3899783)\n\n“Application leaders must anticipate and prepare to\n\nmitigate potential risks of data corruption, model\n\ntheft, and adversarial samples.”\n\n\nThere are good reasons for industries to consider\n\nsecuring their ML systems:\n\n1. In the last three years, companies heavily\n\ninvested in ML (Google, Amazon, Microsoft,\n\nTesla) faced some degree of adversarial\n\nattacks[18-21]—a bellwether of the rise of\n\nadversarial ML.\n\n[2. Standards organizations like ISO[22] and NIST,[23 ]](https://www.iso.org/committee/6794475.html)\n\nwhose endorsements have been historically\n\nsought after in the industry,[24 ]are forming\n\ncertification rubrics to assess security of ML\n\nsystems. Governments are also showing signs\n\n\nof increased appetite for regulations on ML\n\nsecurity, with the earliest regulatory activity\n\nlikely to be in the EU and the United States. A\n\ncomplete checklist has been released in the\n\nEU to assess trustworthiness of ML systems,\n\nwhich will potentially form the basis of new\n\n[regulations.[25]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai)\n\n3.

One of\n\nthe top challenges in SOCs today is finding the balance: identifying unique, advanced threats while maintaining\n\na manageable number of incidents. With the increasing amount of data and diversity of sources collected in a\n\nSOC, the defender community must harness the power of ML to address this challenge.\n\nSecurity and compliance products with ML built in[28] can help security analysts, data scientists, and engineers act\n\nmore efficiently and effectively by enabling them to focus on the threats that matter. Identifying threats that fly\n\nunder the radar while maintaining a low level of alert fatigue is achieved by incorporating graph-based ML and\n\na probabilistic kill chain (likelihood of a series of activities being part of an attack flow). Telemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\n\n\n[ML can stitch together millions of lower fidelity anomalous signals into just tens of high-fidelity alerts. ]\n\nIn internal evaluations and measurements with customers, we found a median 90% reduction in alert fatigue\n\nusing a Microsoft technology called Fusion. In one application, Fusion evaluates tens of thousands of suspicious\n\nuses of Tor browsers and hundreds of thousands of suspicious firewall rule violations per month, fusing them\n\ntogether into just a dozen high-fidelity incidents of “compromised devices” that are surfaced to the SOC analyst.\n\n**Enrichment**\n\nGiven the high number of investigations a SOC handles daily, it’s crucial to prioritize the investigations of users\n\nwith the highest impact to the organization, in case the account or device is breached. Enriching user metadata\n\nwith information about the user “blast radius” based on their position in the organization and role importance\n\nprovides this valuable prioritization and reduces the mean time to resolve the most critical incidents.\n\nFor example, a login by a user from a location they’re not usually associated with or have never used before,\n\nwould be considered suspicious and an alert would be issued. However, if the user’s peers were logging in from\n\nthe same location, this similar activity would indicate the event is probably benign and the associated alert\n\nwould be suppressed. This enrichment reduces mean time to resolution by enabling security personnel to focus\n\ntheir investigations on alerts that matter. It can also reduce SecOps investigation time and level of\n\nexpertise required.\n\n**Peer data:** For a given user, we infer the ranked list of the user’s peers and frequent collaborators.\n\n**Blast radius:** For a given user, we infer the user’s “blast radius,” or the list of important assets that the user\n\nhas access to.\n\n###### 21,000 HOURS\n Time spent annually by security analysts triaging false positives.[29]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### What is a blast radius?\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Democratizing machine learning in security with SOC-ML\n\nMicrosoft security analysts and data scientists are constantly adding new ML anomalies and successfully finding\n\nvaluable incidents in customer environments. To scale this effort and make it ubiquitous across the variety of\n\nthird-party and custom data types, we need the help of the security community—especially managed security\n\nservice providers (MSSPs) and large organizations that have the necessary security expertise. The major\n\nchallenge this community encounters is finding security analysts with data science skills needed to develop\n\nML models.\n\nTo address this challenge, we advocate democratizing the development of these security ML models, making\n\nthem accessible to security professionals with no data science background. SOC-ML is an effort to address this\n\nchallenge, allowing security analysts to customize a model within a familiar user experience, fitting it to the\n\nneeds of their organizations. It provides the ability to reduce alert fatigue by controlling the features used in the\n\nML model and the thresholds of the scores produced. SOC-ML also provides explainable model scores, which\n\nhas been a roadblock for wide ML adoption in security. Although democratization of ML continues to trickle into\n\nvarious technology areas, SOC-ML is a unique and disruptive approach in the security space.\n\n###### Leveraging anomaly detection for post-breach detection\n\nBehavioral anomaly detection has become increasingly important in enhancing post-breach attack detection.\nOnce an attacker has penetrated the enterprise through phishing or other means, there’s very little labeled\ndata, and the attacker has a huge variety of options, reducing the applicability of supervised ML and suggesting\ninstead unsupervised methods that don’t require labeled data, such as anomaly detection.\n\nWhile the methods of anomaly detection are varied, some common themes are present:\n\n**• Behavioral changes over time are important. Models that can encode time-varying behaviors such as**\n\ntime-of-day, day-of-week, and other variations over time are critical for effective use in security settings.\n\n\n###### Democratizing security ML with explainable model scoresImage of dashboard user interface for SOC-ML, with explainable model scores.\n\n**• Automatic, streaming model updating is more suitable for anomaly detection than the batch train/test**\n\nprocess of supervised ML.\n\n - The combination of weak anomalies (those that individually are prone to high false positive rates) to\n\nproduce strong, attack-relevant rarity is a powerful method to deploy anomaly detection in security\n\napplications. Combining several rare events all indicating attack is much stronger than considering them\n\nindependently.\n\n - For post-breach kill chain detection, graphs are the topology upon which we combine anomaly scores.\n\n\n-----\n\n[We can see in the figures an example of anomaly detection and weak signals combined to produce ]\n\nactionable detection of the Parinacotta ransomware group for one of our customers. This case was reported\n\nthrough our Microsoft Threat Experts targeted attack notifications directly to the customer. The root-cause brute\n\nforce followed by lateral movement and the dropping of ransomware on victim machines was discovered via\n\nprobabilistic graph combination of anomaly and alert signals.

These attacks represent some of the most advanced and persistent threat activity Microsoft tracks.  \n\n\nNation state activity groups are focused, have the\n\nmeans to develop and deploy novel techniques and\n\ntactics, and are constantly working to improve their\n\ncapabilities. We understand the complex nature\n\nof nation state cyberthreats and mobilize all our\n\nsecurity analysis and products to discover, track, and\n\ndefend our customers against them.\n\nMicrosoft’s approach to defending against nation\n\nstate threats is as multifaceted as the threats\n\nthemselves. Our approach rests on a thorough\n\nunderstanding of the tactics and techniques these\n\ngroups use, their targeting patterns, and the\n\npossible objectives driving their activity.\n\n\nThese insights, along with the fidelity Microsoft\n\nsignals provide, allow us to better spot emerging\n\nmalicious campaigns, warn customers about the\n\nactivity, and implement protections against them.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center follows\n\nthese threats, builds comprehensive profiles of the\n\nactivity, and works closely with all Microsoft security\n\nteams to implement detections and mitigations to\n\nprotect our customers. Each of those teams shares\n\nrelated indicators, detections, and research to build\n\nunparalleled visibility into these advanced threats\n\nacross the full suite of Microsoft products\n\nand services.\n\n\nIn this chapter, we share some of Microsoft’s\n\nintelligence on the tactics commonly used by nation\n\nstate groups, the industry verticals and geographic\n\nregions they target most often, and assessments on\n\nthe possible motivations for this malicious activity.\n\nOur hope is that sharing this knowledge will help\n\nsecurity organizations better understand and defend\n\nagainst these sophisticated and consequential threats.Icon representing the Nation State Threats chapter.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tracking nation state threats\n\n Microsoft tracks nation state activities to protect our platforms, our services, and our customers. We use a variety of metrics and sophisticated data integration techniques to better understand targeting, motivations, and customer impact. MSTIC focuses on nation state activities because these tactics, techniques, and procedures are often unique and novel, prompting downstream actors such as cybercriminals and smaller nation states to eventually copy their methods. \n\nThe use of open-source defensive toolkits to improve proactive detections of threats has increasingly become a\n\nway for nation state actors to obfuscate their activity by hiding in plain sight using weaponized open-source code.\n\nMSTIC analysts focus on nation state activities regardless of platform, targeted victim, or geographical region,\n\nand we maintain visibility and active threat hunting worldwide. The information presented here provides a\n\nsnapshot of customers impacted by nation state activity. It’s important to note that even if a particular industry\n\nsector or geographic region isn’t represented in the information here, nation state activity spans nearly every\n\nindustry sector and geographic region. In other words, protections against these tactics are critical for every\n\norganization and individual. Our intelligence is also impacted by the degree to which our products and\n\nplatforms are utilized in a particular geography or for particular purposes.\n\n###### Nation state notifications\n\nWhen a customer (organization or individual account holder) is targeted or compromised by nation state\n\nactivities that Microsoft tracks, we deliver a nation state notification (NSN) to the customer. Over the past\n\ntwo years, Microsoft has delivered over 13,000 NSNs. The highest percentage of NSNs represented activity\n\noriginating in Russia, followed by Iran, China, North Korea, and other countries.Graph of targeted geographic regions based on nation state notifications, July 2019 through June 2020.

Our relentless pursuit of these adversaries and our continuous development of new capabilities to detect and deter malicious activity\n support our commitment to customer protection.\n\n Guide to nation state actors discussed in this report\n\nThroughout this chapter, we cite examples of nation state actors to provide a deeper view into attack targets,\n\ntechniques, and analysis of motivations. Microsoft identifies nation state activities with chemical element names,\n\njust some of which are shown on the following page together with the countries from which the actors operate.\n\nThis small sample of the total nation state actors tracked by Microsoft represents those that were most active in\n\nthe last year (July 2019–June 2020) and made most effective use of the tactics detailed in this chapter.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Sample of nation state actors and their activities\n\n\n-----\n\n###### [Top 5 detected nation state activity ] groups targeting Microsoft customers\n (July 2019–June 2020)Graph depicting top 5 detected nation state activity groups for July 2019 through June 2020 based on number of NSNs sent. Strontium 63%, Phosphorus 18%, Mercury 9%, Nickel 5%, Thallium 5%.\n\n Our approach\n\nMicrosoft uses four main approaches to disrupt\n\nnation state actors—technology, operations, legal\n\naction, and policy—and each one plays an important\n\nrole in our commitment to protecting customers.\n\n**Leveraging technology:**\n\nMicrosoft’s cumulative knowledge of the global\n\nthreat landscape enables our products and services\n\nto constantly create and update new detections that\n\nprotect and defend against nation state activities at\n\nscale. These collective defenses represent the most\n\neffective method to counter nation state threats\n\nbecause they’re informed by the extensive threat\n\nintelligence resources built into each product and\n\nenabled by world-class engineering.\n\n\n**Taking action against malicious operations:**\n\nFrom time to time, Microsoft will have sufficient\n\ninformation to warrant a one-time deletion or\n\nshutdown of infrastructure or assets associated with\n\na nation state attacker. By taking proactive action\n\nagainst malicious infrastructure, the actor loses\n\nvisibility, capability, and access across a range of\n\nassets previously under their control, forcing them\n\nto rebuild. An example of this scenario would be the\n\nTHALLIUM disruption in late 2019.[31]\n\n**Leveraging legal actions:**\n\nOne of Microsoft’s unique resources in the fight\n\nagainst nation states is the Digital Crimes Unit. The\n\nDCU is responsible for lawsuits against STRONTIUM,\n\nBARIUM, PHOSPHORUS, and THALLIUM. Using\n\n\nmalicious nation state activities across governments,\n\nenterprises, academia, social organizations, and the\n\npublic. Talking publicly about nation state attacks\n\nis an important part of deterrence. For example, in\n\nOctober 2019, Microsoft identified publicly that an\n\naccount associated with a U.S. presidential campaign\n\nhad been targeted by PHOSPHORUS.[32, 33] This public\n\ndisclosure drove a significant dialogue about the\n\nattack and election security, with sustained media\n\ncoverage, putting a spotlight on the necessity of\n\nprotecting political campaigns from foreign actors.\n\n\nlitigation to seize domains and assets used by nation\n\nstate actors against Microsoft customers, DCU has\n\nbeen instrumental in shutting down those attack\n\nvectors. These four cases have led to the takedown\n\nof hundreds of domains and the protection of\n\nthousands of customers. Lessons learned from the\n\ncases are shared with Microsoft engineering teams\n\nto help improve our operational and technical\n\ndisruption capabilities.\n\n**Informing public discourse and policy:**\n\nMicrosoft uses its voice to raise awareness\n\nabout nation state activities when we see them,\n\nhighlighting the context and impacts of the\n\nincidents. This reporting helps drive a broad\n\ndiscussion about what can be done to combat\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Common targets and motivations\n\n To provide a deeper analysis of some of the observed nation state activity, we look at frequently\n targeted sectors and the motivations of the attackers.\n\n\n###### Critical infrastructure Telemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\n[Nation state activity is more likely to target ]\n\n[organizations outside of the critical infrastructure](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors)\n\n[sectors by a significant measure, with over 90% of](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors)\n\nnotifications served outside of these sectors.\n\nWithin the critical infrastructure sectors, targeting of\n\nIT organizations represents over 60% of nation state\n\nactivity, followed by commercial facilities, critical\n\nmanufacturing, financial services, and the defense\n\nindustrial base.\n\n###### Frequently targeted sectors Telemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\n[The sectors listed below were consistent targets ]\n\nof nation state activity in the period from July 2019\n\nthrough June 2020. We’ve listed them in order of\n\nprevalence with respect to the number of NSNs\n\ndelivered to each sector.\n\n\n###### Top 6 targeted industry sectors by NSNs delivered (July 2019–June 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Top 6 targeted industry sectors\n\n\n###### 32% Non-governmental organizations\n\nThe NGO recipients of NSNs included organizations\n\nsuch as advocacy groups, human rights\n\norganizations, nonprofit organizations, and think\n\ntanks focused on public policy, international affairs,\n\nand security. STRONTIUM was responsible for more\n\nthan three quarters of activity triggering NSNs\n\nin this sector through heavy targeting of sports\n\nassociations. DUBNIUM was the second most active\n\ngroup, followed by ZINC, THALLIUM,\n\nand PHOSPHORUS.\n\n###### 31% Professional services\n\nSupport services and trusted third parties can\n\nserve as launch points for intrusions or collection\n\nagainst government targets, whose systems might\n\nhave more robust security protocols in place. In the\n\nlast year, STRONTIUM attempted to compromise\n\nconsulting firms and government contractors,\n\nspecifically U.S. defense contractors and large public\n\naffairs, corporate legal, IT, media, and physical\n\nsecurity consultancies operating in the United States,\n\n\n###### 13% Government organizations\n\nNation state threat actors attempted to compromise\n\nforeign ministries and equivalent diplomatic\n\ninstitutions in countries across the Americas,\n\nAustralia, Central and Southern Africa, Europe, and\n\nthe Middle East. NICKEL made an aggressive push\n\nagainst foreign ministries in 11 countries across Latin\n\nAmerica and Europe during this period. Microsoft\n\ndiscovered YTTRIUM had gained footholds in the\n\ndiplomatic missions of several European countries.\n\nMilitary institutions and national legislatures were\n\nalso popular targets in the government sector.\n\n###### 10% International organizations\n\nAmong international organizations, global and\n\nregional organizations working on governance\n\nnorms and human rights were top targets. MERCURY\n\nattempted to compromise a high number of targets\n\ninvolved in work with refugees. THALLIUM focused\n\nits efforts on a regional organization devoted to\n\ndevelopments in Africa. As the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nunfolded, both DUBNIUM and PHOSPHORUS\n\ndirected their attention toward global health\n\ni tit ti\n\n\n###### 7% Information technology firms\n\nAs mentioned earlier, IT is the most heavily\n\ntargeted of the critical infrastructure sectors.\n\nAttacks on IT products and service providers are\n\nthe most prevalent in this category, followed by\n\ncompanies that provide internet routing, access,\n\nand connections. MANGANESE was the most\n\nactive against IT sector targets, pursuing account\n\ncompromise in U.S.-based companies involved in\n\nmicrochip technology, cybersecurity, and networking\n\nsolutions. MERCURY targeted network technology\n\nproviders in the Middle East.\n\n\n###### 7% Higher education\n\nActors STRONTIUM, PHOSPHORUS, BARIUM,\n\nTHALLIUM, and ZINC all targeted universities in\n\nthis period. Victims were spread across the globe,\n\nincluding institutions of higher education in the\n\nUnited States, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the\n\nMiddle East. Colleges and universities are targeted\n\nbecause they often house cutting-edge research\n\ninitiatives that might be of interest to nation state\n\nactors. For example, a suspected nation state group\n\noperating out of China compromised accounts\n\nat a U.S. university involved in COVID-19 vaccine\n\nresearch in March. Beyond scientific research\n\nitself, nation state actors originating from both\n\nNorth Korea and Iran targeted global universities’\n\nsubject matter experts (SMEs) that influence\n\ninternational policy on topics ranging from\n\ninternational security and nuclear nonproliferation\n\nto domestic politics and human rights in their\n\nrespective regions. Accessing the SMEs’ personal\n\nand professional contacts could serve espionage\n\nand counterespionage purposes for the supporting\n\nnation state.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Targeting major events and other opportunities\n\n###### Major current events are commonly targeted by nation state actors or leveraged as opportunities to further operational objectives. Microsoft has observed several such operations targeting events around the globe, including elections and individuals tied to political campaigns as well as the Olympic Games. More recently, several nation state actors took advantage of the global COVID-19 pandemic to craft targeted spear- phishing lures in credential theft and malware deployment efforts.\n\n\nagainst organizations affiliated with previous\n\nOlympic Games, some of these attacks were able\n\nto successfully gain access to targeted accounts.\n\nSTRONTIUM has consistently targeted these\n\norganizations using spear phishing, password spray,\n\nand both open-source and custom malware to\n\ncompromise devices for further espionage.[35]\n\n###### COVID-19 outbreak\n\nMicrosoft observed 16 different nation state actors\n\neither targeting customers involved in the global\n\nCOVID-19 response efforts or leveraging the crisis\n\nin themed lures to expand their credential theft and\n\nmalware delivery tactics. These COVID-19-themed\n\nattacks targeted prominent government healthcare\n\norganizations in efforts to perform reconnaissance\n\non their networks or people. They targeted global\n\nmedical relief and humanitarian aid organizations\n\nwith spear-phishing lures paired with malicious\n\n\nmacros in Word documents. They also crafted\n\nunique credential theft lures spoofing a popular\n\nU.S. fast food chain’s COVID-19 response email\n\nand spoofed offers of online coupons. Academic\n\nand commercial organizations involved in vaccine\n\nresearch were also targeted.\n\nAlthough these activities didn’t represent\n\nsignificant operational shifts by these actors during\n\nthe COVID-19 crisis, it’s imperative that every\n\norganization affiliated with or affected by a major\n\npublic event understand how their organization\n\ndefends against the tactics commonly used by these\n\nactors.\n\n**Learn more :**\n\n_[New cyber attacks targeting US elections 2020/09/10](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)_\n\n\n###### Political campaigns\n\nIn a 30-day period between August and September\n\n2019, MSTIC observed PHOSPHORUS performing\n\npassword sprays, making more than 2,700 attempts\n\nto identify consumer email accounts belonging to\n\nspecific Microsoft customers, and then proceeding\n\nto attack 241 of those accounts. The targeted\n\naccounts are associated with a U.S. presidential\n\ncampaign, current and former U.S. government\n\nofficials, journalists covering global politics,\n\nand prominent Iranians living outside Iran. Four\n\naccounts were compromised as a result of these\n\nattempts. (These four accounts weren’t associated\n\nwith the U.S. presidential campaign or current and\n\nformer U.S. government officials.) As we approach\n\nthe 2020 U.S. general election, we’re likely to see\n\nactivity increase after this report was written.\n\nMSTIC has previously observed similar patterns by\n\nSTRONTIUM and other actors targeting elections or\n\n\npolitically affiliated organizations in other countries.\n\nZIRCONIUM, operating from China, has attempted\n\nto gain intelligence on organizations associated\n\nwith the upcoming U.S. presidential election. We’ve\n\ndetected thousands of attacks from ZIRCONIUM\n\nbetween March 2020 and September 2020 resulting\n\nin nearly 150 compromises. As additional elections\n\noccur around the world, Microsoft will continue to\n\nmonitor and notify our customers of these attacks.\n\n###### 2020 Olympic Games\n\nAs the world prepared for the Tokyo Summer\n\nOlympic Games in 2020, at least 16 national and\n\ninternational sporting and anti-doping organizations\n\nacross three continents were targeted. The attacks\n\n[began on September 16, 2019, just before news](https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/49805296)\n\n[reports emerged about new potential action](https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/49805296)\n\nbeing taken by the World Anti-Doping Agency\n\n(WADA). Following patterns detected in attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Common operational aims\n\nNation state actors often conduct intrusions in pursuit of larger strategic objectives, which they view as critical to the stability, prosperity, and sometimes survival of their\n\nhome nations. As such, these groups are highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources into achieving their operational objectives. Whatever the\n\nstrategic objective behind it, nation state cyberthreat activity has common operational aims: to steal information (about you, your business, personnel, customers, or\n\npartners) or to disrupt or destroy components of your operations.\n\n###### Espionage\n\n\nMicrosoft tracks several nation state activity groups\n\nfor whom espionage is their main goal. These\n\ngroups operate to gather information about the\n\nintentions and movements of targets of interest.\n\nSome of the information they’re looking for includes\n\ngovernment correspondence, proprietary business\n\ninformation, and individual contacts.\n\n**Government correspondence**\n\nGovernment correspondence speaks directly to\n\nnational plans and intentions. Threat actors across\n\nthe globe focus on compromising foreign ministries\n\nbecause these organizations produce, exchange, and\n\nstore voluminous content about their home nations’\n\nforeign policy and security priorities. The extensive\n\ntargeting of think tanks and policy-oriented NGOs\n\nis probably also reflective of a hunt for insights\n\ninto government policy. Think tanks and NGOs\n\nfocus largely on government policy often without\n\nthe baseline attention to cybersecurity that many\n\ngovernment agencies have, making them attractive\n\ntargets from which to collect insights into\n\ni l li\n\n\n**Proprietary business information**\n\nNation state threat actors seek to collect trade\n\nsecrets and intellectual property for a number of\n\nreasons, which can include accelerating the growth\n\nof their own domestic industries, advancing a\n\nmilitary program, or determining how advanced\n\nan adversarial nation’s weapons or technology\n\ncapabilities are. As the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nunfolded, China-based nation state threat actors\n\ntargeted medical research institutions in the United\n\nStates and Asia, highlighting competition for\n\nmedical innovations as another potential motive for\n\nproprietary information theft.\n\n**Individual contacts**\n\nIn addition to directly attempting to collect\n\ninformation about experts in their fields of interest,\n\nnation state threat actors seek information on\n\nindividuals to learn about their intentions and ideas,\n\nsimilar to the tactics described in the Government\n\ncorrespondence section. They might also be seeking\n\nto improve the effectiveness of spear phishing and\n\nh i l i i ff d f\n\n\nadditional attack vectors within a target’s personal or\n\nprofessional networks. In April and May 2020, ZINC\n\nactors sent phishing lures spoofing multiple U.S.\nbased aerospace firms to employees at competitor\n\nfirms in Asia and Europe, probably hoping to\n\nincrease collection opportunities in the sector. For\n\nmore information and detailed examples of how\n\nthis information is employed in operations, see the\n\nCommon attack techniques by nation state actors\n\nsection of this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Disruption or destruction\n\nAlthough less common than espionage, nation state threat actors have conducted intrusions intended to disrupt\n\nor destroy data or physical assets at targeted facilities or institutions. The U.S. National Institute of Standards\n\nand Technology (NIST) defines a disruption as “an unplanned event that causes the general system or major\n\napplication to be inoperable for an unacceptable length of time.”[36] Disruptive operations can, for example,\n\nresult in minor or extended power outages or extended network unavailability. Destructive operations involve\n\n“overwriting, erasing, or physically destroying information,” equipment, or facilities.[37]\n\nA look at past activities suggests nation state actors might engage in disruptive or destructive operations to\n\nretaliate against actions by a perceived actor, to deter or discourage continuation of certain activities, or to test\n\nnew or developing cyber tools and techniques. For example, actors operating from Russia have a history of\n\nlaunching disruptive and potentially destructive cyberattacks in response to perceived anti-Russian actions in\n\ninternational sport. In advance of the Olympic Games in 2016 and 2018, respectively, suspected Russia-based\n\nthreat actors stole and leaked athletes’ sensitive medical data and rendered inoperable the servers comprising\n\nthe IT backbone of the Olympic Games.[39]\n\nLate in 2019, Microsoft observed STRONTIUM attempting to compromise at least 16 national and international\n\nsporting and anti-doping organizations across three continents. These attempts began when WADA announced\n\nits decision to investigate Russia’s anti-doping agency in September 2019 and continued through December\n\n2019 when WADA ultimately ruled to ban the Russian national team from participation in the Olympic Games.[40]\n\n_[36 https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/disruption](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/disruption)_\n\n_[37 https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Destruction](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Destruction)_\n\n_[38 \u0007“Russian hackers leak Simone Biles and Serena Williams files,” BBC News, September 13, 2016, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-37352326; “WADA](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-37352326)_\n\n_[confirms another batch of athlete data leaked by Russian cyber hackers ‘Fancy Bear,’” WADA website, September 14, 2016.

The sections below represent the most common tactics used by nation state actors in the last year.\n\n Reconnaissance\n\n\n###### Example of name reconnaissance\n\n conducted by PHOSPHORUS:\n\n iterations of name formats\n\n including personal attacks\n\n J.Smith@contoso.com\n\n John.smith@contoso.com\n\n John.m.smith@contoso.com\n\n JohnSmith@contoso.com\n\n johnmsmith@contoso.com\n\n\nMicrosoft has observed a significant increase in\n\npassword spray attacks by nation state actors in the\n\nlast year that indicate a new level of sophistication\n\nin their reconnaissance tactics. Identifying and\n\naccessing legitimate user accounts is a critical\n\nmethod that an increasing number of nation state\n\nactors are using to successfully infiltrate a targeted\n\norganization and achieve operational aims.\n\nPHOSPHORUS, HOLMIUM, and STRONTIUM are\n\nexamples of actors associated with nation state\n\noperations that have successfully refined the\n\npassword spray tactic for reconnaissance over the\n\npast two years. Password sprays have included\n\nknown accounts across large organizations but have\n\nalso included iterations of possible name formats to\n\ndiscover accounts, including personal accounts.\n\nPHOSPHORUS has targeted a wide variety of\n\n\norganizations in the past year, with particular\n\nfocus on targeting personal email accounts of\n\nindividuals employed or affiliated with their\n\nobjective. These operations have largely focused on\n\nindividuals involved in human rights organizations,\n\nhumanitarian or refugee relief efforts, NGOs defining\n\nor setting policies associated with international\n\nsanctions, or personal accounts of government\n\nemployees.\n\nPersonal email accounts are a particularly effective\n\ntarget for a reconnaissance operation since\n\nmost individuals don’t apply the level of security\n\nprotections applied by larger organizations (such as\n\nMFA and complex passwords). Individuals in smaller\n\norganizations might also use consumer email\n\nplatforms for official communications, making them\n\nhigh-value targets for surveillance. If a large-scale\n\n\npassword spray or password guessing operation is\n\nlaunched against a set of known accounts, one of\n\nthe most effective ways to proactively prevent those\n\nattacks is through the combination of MFA and\n\nstrong passwords.\n\nHOLMIUM uses a combination of tactics to gain\n\naccess to networks, including socially engineered\n\nspear-phishing operations and password spray\n\nattacks. During one wave of activity over a two-day\n\nperiod in January 2020, HOLMIUM password spray\n\nactivity attempted logins against 33,141 different\n\ntenants with an average of 2.74 accounts per tenant.\n\n\nOther capabilities of HOLMIUM include use of\n\nopen-source “penetration testing tools” as well\n\nas custom PowerShell-based tools. Attacks have\n\ntargeted entities affiliated with the oil and gas sector\n\nand its supporting industries, including maritime\n\ntransportation and logistics companies. HOLMIUM\n\nactors have been observed deploying Ruler, a self\ndescribed “tool to abuse Exchange accounts” on\n\ncompromised accounts.⁴¹ The Ruler command and\n\ncontrol server in turn deploys a custom PowerShell\nbased implant identified as “Powerton.”\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Credential harvesting\n\nCredential harvesting is a common tactic used\n\nby nation state actors to improve their ability to\n\ncompromise a targeted organization. Microsoft\n\ntracks activity by multiple actors that leverage spear\nphishing emails, carefully crafted imitation domains,\n\nand spoofed login pages to convince employees\n\nto login using their corporate credentials. These\n\nlogins on maliciously crafted websites steal and then\n\nreuse the usernames and passwords recorded by\n\nunsuspecting employees.\n\nTHALLIUM is one Microsoft-identified nation\n\nstate actor that uses credential harvesting as\n\na successful tactic to gain access to NGOs,\n\ngovernment organizations, and other professional\n\nservices organizations affiliated with their areas of\n\ngeopolitical interest. THALLIUM spends significant\n\nresources purchasing and using imitation domains\n\nthat resemble their targeted organization’s name,\n\nor using the name of an online service the target\n\nuses, as the subdomain. For example, THALLIUM\n\nregistered the client-mobile.work domain and\n\nthen created a subdomain that includes the words\n\n“login” and “outlook” (such as login-outlook.\n\n_client-mobile.work) to raise the likelihood they_\n\nwill successfully convince a targeted individual to\n\n\nprovide their credentials. THALLIUM then set up a\n\ncloned authentication page to convince the target\n\nto provide their username and password, thinking\n\nthey were logging into a legitimate corporate site.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that use of the word “mobile”\n\ncould also indicate they anticipated a user might\n\nclick on this lure from a mobile phone and the\n\nscreen size or difficulty in seeing the full URL on\n\nthese devices might increase the likelihood a user\n\nwill fall for the lure.\n\nTHALLIUM’s spoofed pages include most major\n\nonline service brands. The servers they use to\n\nconduct this credential theft are often compromised\n\nservers of other legitimate companies, such\n\nas a small business computer that has been\n\ncompromised and then set up as infrastructure for\n\nthis intrusion. THALLIUM has also been known to\n\nuse inexpensive regional virtual private server (VPS)\n\nproviders as infrastructure for similar operations.\n\nIn the last year, MSTIC has discovered more than\n\n500 domains that were registered by THALLIUM\n\nto conduct credential theft operations—most\n\nmimicking a well-known brand to successfully lure\n\ntheir targeted user.\n\n\nTHALLIUM typically attempts to trick victims\n\nthrough spear phishing. By gathering information\n\nabout the targeted individuals from social media,\n\npublic personnel directories from organizations\n\nthe individual is involved with, and other public\n\nsources, THALLIUM is able to craft a personalized\n\nspear-phishing email in a way that gives the email\n\ncredibility to the target. As seen in the sample\n\nspear-phishing email below, the content is designed\n\nto appear legitimate, but closer review shows that\n\nTHALLIUM has spoofed the sender by combining\n\nthe letters “r” and “n” to appear as the first letter “m”\n\nin “microsoft.com.” The link in the email redirects\n\nthe user to a website requesting the user’s account\n\ncredentials. By tricking victims into clicking on the\n\nfraudulent links and providing their credentials,\n\nTHALLIUM is then able to log in to the victim’s\n\naccount.\n\nAdditionally, THALLIUM will often create a new\n\nmail-forwarding rule in the victim’s account settings.\n\nThis mail-forwarding rule will forward all new emails\n\nreceived by the victim to THALLIUM-controlled\n\naccounts. By using forwarding rules, THALLIUM can\n\ncontinue to see email received by the victim, even\n\nafter the victim’s account password is updated.\n\n\n###### Credential harvesting exampleDiagram of spoofing by combining letters “r” and “n” to appear as the letter “m”\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[STRONTIUM: Detecting new patterns in credential](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2020%2F09%2F10%2Fstrontium-detecting-new-patters-credential-harvesting%2F&data=02%7C01%7CAnne.Borozan%40microsoft.com%7C5081772fbdc9491a2c7208d8566b8bec%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637354367190328675&sdata=KYlpMtifKQJt77wEKrNlC0jfP7xghuURElG7d03%2BdKk%3D&reserved=0)_\n_[harvesting 2020/09/10](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2020%2F09%2F10%2Fstrontium-detecting-new-patters-credential-harvesting%2F&data=02%7C01%7CAnne.Borozan%40microsoft.com%7C5081772fbdc9491a2c7208d8566b8bec%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637354367190328675&sdata=KYlpMtifKQJt77wEKrNlC0jfP7xghuURElG7d03%2BdKk%3D&reserved=0)_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware\n\nMalware represents one of the most effective and\n\ncommonly used methods by nation state actors\n\nto successfully infiltrate and maintain persistence\n\non a targeted system. Advanced adversaries invest\n\nheavily in development of unique malware, but\n\nalso are known to obfuscate their activity by using\n\nopenly available malicious code for mainstream\n\nonline criminal activity. Even more common is the\n\nmalicious use of known vulnerabilities in commercial\n\nenterprise software to take advantage of poorly\n\nsecured targets.\n\nBARIUM is a long-running actor with abundant\n\nsuccess in compromising victims since 2006.\n\nAlthough the group has been observed mostly\n\ntargeting information technology, software, and IT\n\nproducts and services companies, Microsoft has\n\nseen BARIUM target a wide range of organizations\n\nincluding but not limited to retail, manufacturing,\n\nNGOs, government organizations, gaming, and\n\nhospitality. BARIUM is particularly effective at\n\nimproving on their own custom malware and\n\nleveraging open-source tools to limit detection.\n\n\nBARIUM appears to frequently upgrade and refine\n\ntheir toolkit with slight modifications to their\n\nimplants to stay ahead of defenders. Some of the\n\nmodifications to their implants suggest that BARIUM\n\nactively develops and maintains either the primary\n\ncodebase or a fork of PlugX, Strilix (Crosswalk), and\n\nWinnti malware.\n\nThe attention to detail seen in BARIUM\n\nreconnaissance, infrastructure setup, and custom\n\nmalware has contributed to abundant success in\n\ncompromising targets.\n\nSummary of techniques BARIUM has used\n\nsuccessfully in past operations:\n\n**• Windows shortcut (.Lnk) with hidden**\n\n**payloads**\n\nWindows Shortcut.Ink with hidden payloads\n\nwas observed in the summer 2016. The RAR\n\narchive BARIUM sent to the victim contained\n\na Windows Shortcut file, Resume.docx, and\n\nan executable named Thumbs.db. When the\n\nvictim ran the .lnk file, it installed the Win32/\n\nBarlaiy3F[42] implant and then displayed a\n\nlegitimate Resume.docx.\n\n\n\n**• Windows compiled html help files. (.Chm)**\n\nBecause Microsoft HTML Help is a necessary\n\nfeature in the Windows platform, HTML Help\n\ngenerates .CHM files legitimately that can be\n\nviewed by using the Windows HH.exe viewer.\n\nBARIUM delivers malicious .CHM files that\n\nexecute when the user opens them. While the\n\nuser will see what appears to be a legitimate\n\ndocument in the Help Viewer (commonly a\n\nrésumé), the malware silently runs JavaScript\n\nthat executes the malware delivery and stores it\n\nin xml.htm.\n\n**• Microsoft PowerPoint and Word documents**\n\n**with macro**\n\nThis technique required the victims to “enable\n\ncontent” (macros) within a malicious PowerPoint\n\nor Word file typically delivered in an email. This\n\ntechnique can bypass protections if users aren’t\n\ncareful and manually enable the macro when\n\nopening the document. The theme of these files\n\nwas typically focused on résumés or business\n\ndevelopment, aligning with themes uncovered\n\nin the reconnaissance phases. When these\n\nmacros were successfully run, a backdoor trojan\n\nwas installed.\n\n\nBARIUM also uses what’s described as “supply chain”\n\ntechniques as an initial infection vector against\n\norganizations globally. In these cases, BARIUM\n\ncompromises software companies and modifies their\n\nsource code to install malware. Modifying legitimate\n\nsoftware and compromising update processes allows\n\nBARIUM to selectively compromise organizations\n\nof their choosing. BARIUM has embedded malware\n\nin legitimate software executables which, when\n\ndeployed, beaconed over DNS to infrastructure that\n\nBARIUM controlled. By monitoring this DNS traffic,\n\nBARIUM could select their victim and customize\n\ndelivery of more specialized modules to clients of\n\ntheir choosing.\n\nMore recently, BARIUM has shifted their techniques\n\nto start using more open-source malware tooling in\n\ntheir attacks. Microsoft has observed them dropping\n\nbatch files that are used to create persistence\n\nfor their Implants using Crosswalk/Strilix and\n\nCobaltStrike, two common open-source penetration\n\ntesting tools that can easily be weaponized for\n\nattacks.\n\nFor more information on software supply chain,\n\nsee the In focus: Supply chain security section of\n\nthis report.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### VPN Exploits\n\nAs the world adjusts to increased numbers of\n\nremote workers, global enterprise IT departments\n\nrely on VPNs to improve the connectivity and\n\nsecurity of systems. Typically, this critical service is\n\nmanaged by third-party software deployed across\n\nour devices. Since mid-2019, Microsoft has observed\n\nnation state actors consistently targeting and\n\nfrequently compromising outdated and unpatched\n\nVPN infrastructure. This activity indicates they view\n\nit as an easy and effective method for penetrating\n\nand persisting on a targeted network by using\n\ncompromised credentials.\n\nMANGANESE has been successful in compromising\n\nvictims since 2010.

Although there were increasingly more opportunities to work remotely in recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed these efforts, forcing a significant portion of the workforce to work from home. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated, “We have seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months.”\n\n\n43\n\n\nThe immediacy and scale of moving to a remote workforce brought along new security challenges. When\n\nMicrosoft recommended employees work from home even before governmental regulations required it, its\n\nworkforce was able to respond quickly. As long as employees had secure, adequate internet access at their\n\nremote locations, they could continue being fully productive and, most critically, they could protect themselves\n\nand their families from the pandemic. We were successful in making this transition because we invested in a\n\nZero Trust architecture, including MFA, ubiquitous device management, and conditional access enforcement. The\n\ngraph on this page shows how quickly Microsoft became a remote workforce and the scale at which we had to\n\nmanage the requisite infrastructure, applications, and personnel.\n\n\n###### Microsoft employee badge scans for building access\n\n\n-----\n\nAs more organizations adapt to enabling secure remote work options, whether in the short or long term,\n\ncybersecurity provides the foundation for operational resiliency. Successful transition in any type of disruption\n\nrequires a strategic combination of planning, response, and recovery. To maintain cyber resiliency, an\n\norganization should regularly evaluate its risk threshold and ability to operationally execute key processes\n\nthrough a combination of human efforts and technology products and services.\n\nThis chapter provides a look at three areas of risk that have become more apparent with the rapid onset of a\n\nlarge-scale remote workforce. First, we’ll explain how organizations can support a secure, remote workforce\n\nthrough the principles of Zero Trust, including VPN architecture and virtualization—which helped enable\n\nMicrosoft’s own transition to remote work. This section includes how we address security risks associated with\n\nmanaging devices not owned by an organization (and often owned by employees and partners). Second, we\n\naddress the human element as fundamental to a secure workforce by looking at challenges such as insider\n\nthreats and social engineering by malicious actors. Third, we explore lessons learned as we engaged in an\n\nexercise in enterprise resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\n###### Security and remote workforce concerns\n\n**_Security decision makers in the United States perceive their most common remote_**\n\n**_workforce challenge as remote workers making choices that reduce security._**\n\n**_Securing personal devices for remote work and the increase in phishing campaigns_**\n\n**_and identity fraud are also concerns.[44 ]_**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Infrastructure for a remote workforce\n\n Infrastructure security is a fundamental concern when scaling a remote workforce. There’s a substantial difference between an infrastructure that supports employees taking laptops home to monitor email and a complete architecture for a mobile workforce. Originally built for in-office work, many infrastructures weren’t initially prepared for a large scale—and immediate—transition to a remote workforce.\n\n Zero Trust security modelBest practice icon: our recommended controls.\n\n\nBy treating every access attempt as if it were\n\n[originating from an untrusted network, the Zero](https://aka.ms/mszt)\n\n[Trust strategy helps solidify the security of VPNs for](https://aka.ms/mszt)\n\nworking from home. This is precisely the approach\n\nneeded with today’s remote workforces because\n\nthey’re coming from untrusted home networks and\n\nthe VPN architectures used to extend corporate\n\nnetworks are sometimes failing.\n\n_Zero Trust defined: Instead of assuming everything_\n\n_behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust_\n\n_model assumes a breach and verifies each request as_\n\n_though it originates from an open network. Regardless_\n\n_of where the request originates or what resource it_\n\n_accesses, Zero Trust teaches us to “never trust, always_\n\n_verify.” Every access is fully authenticated, authorized,_\n\n_and encrypted before granting access. Micro-_\n\n_segmentation and least-privileged access principles_\n\n_are applied to minimize lateral movement. Rich_\n\n\n_intelligence and analytics are utilized to detect and_\n\n_respond to anomalies in real time._\n\nZero Trust helps secure corporate resources by\n\neliminating unknown and unmanaged devices\n\nand limiting lateral movement. As the COVID-19\n\npandemic forced the “lift and shift” of the\n\ncorporate workforce and much of its workload\n\nto a distributed—or even scattered—model, the\n\nnotion of the corporate security perimeter changed\n\ndramatically. Traditional security policies within the\n\nperimeter became much harder to enforce across\n\na wider network made up of home and other\n\nprivate networks and unmanaged assets in the\n\nconnectivity path. Corporations that had already\n\nmade investments, even partial investments, in areas\n\nthat contribute to Zero Trust, were able to leverage\n\nadvances already made by their security teams\n\nin areas such as strong identity, enrolled device\n\n\nmanagement and device health, alternate access for\n\nunmanaged devices, and application health. Even\n\nin cases where these investments weren’t focused\n\non a full Zero Trust implementation, they became\n\nthe basis for improved security risk mitigation and\n\nmanagement. They collectively helped enable the\n\nextension of the security perimeter to accommodate\n\na physically dispersed workforce and related assets.\n\nMicrosoft’s approach to Zero Trust enablement\n\nallows for staggered or progressive enablement,\n\nwhere the highest priority capabilities—such as\n\nIdentity as a Service (IDaaS)—can be invested in\n\nearlier, with other capabilities enabled subsequently.\n\nThis approach allows customers the ability to\n\nplan their spend and make capital expenditures in\n\nalignment with essential business needs and growth\n\nopportunities.\n\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Microsoft’s approach\n\nfocuses on access architectures that use policy to\n\nexplicitly validate the trustworthiness of users and\n\ndevices. Through validation, Microsoft dynamically\n\naddresses insufficient trust via increasing assurance,\n\nlimiting access, or blocking access altogether. This\n\napproach doesn’t rely on network architectures but\n\ninstead uses IDaaS as the decision engine based\n\non organizational policy. The result is mobility and\n\nchoice to enable productivity for end users (and\n\nremote workers). This model can be extended\n\nfurther to allow users to choose any device from\n\nwhich to work because the access architectures\n\ncan now account for the variability in trust of these\n\npotentially unmanaged devices.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infrastructure required to support the VPN\n\narchitecture and related security stack was often\n\ndesigned to support only a small and controlled\n\npercentage of the user population at any given\n\ntime. When some workforces moved to working\n\nnearly 100% remotely, their architectures became\n\novertaxed under the increased load. That load\n\nincluded not only day-to-day work with email and\n\ndocuments, but also increased use of collaboration\n\nsoftware utilizing audio and video, which would\n\noftentimes be degraded. The full VPN tunnel\n\narchitecture created usability issues for end users,\n\nand in some cases, the VPN infrastructures failed\n\ncompletely as a result. We reached out to 123\n\ncustomers during the initial weeks of the COVID-19\n\noutbreak after noting some latency in their audio or\n\nvideo quality owing to the traffic volume. To tackle\n\nthis issue, some customers doubled down on their\n\nnetwork architectures to increase capacity, while\n\nothers looked for new ways to manage risk in a\n\nmore direct-to-internet network architecture.\n\n\nWhen we asked enterprise security decision makers about deploying Zero Trust, we learned that\n\nmost have deployed it to some extent, and over half plan to speed up Zero Trust deployment.[45]\n\n###### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Zero Trust deploymentGraph depicting 55% of security decision makers plan to speed up deployment of Zero Trust capabilities.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Enable a remote workforce by embracing Zero Trust security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust)_\n\n_[Implementing a Zero Trust security model at Microsoft 2019/08/06](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase/implementing-a-zero-trust-security-model-at-microsoft)_\n\n\n###### VPN architecture\n\nHistorically, VPNs have been used by organizations\n\nto extend their network to additional sites and\n\nindividual users. Traffic from these sites or individual\n\nusers was sent to a central site and then out to the\n\ninternet. For security teams, the network was the\n\noriginal visibility and control plane, and for some\n\ncompanies, it remains a key component of their\n\nsecurity strategy. It’s because of this reliance on\n\nnetwork architectures that security teams tended to\n\nenforce the use of full VPN tunnels to extend their\n\nnetwork security strategy. An architecture that routes\n\nall remote traffic back to the corporate network was\n\noriginally intended to provide the security team with\n\nthe following capabilities:\n\n - Prevention of unauthorized access\n\n - Control of authorized user access\n\n - Network protections such as intrusion detection\n\nand prevention (IDS/IPS) and DDoS mitigation\n\n - Data loss prevention\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Controlling access to corporate resources\n\nPersonally owned, unmanaged devices that access organizational resources are a security risk associated with\n\nremote workforces, as well as third-party vendors and partners.\n\n[As part of Microsoft’s Zero Trust strategy leveraging Azure AD Conditional Access, we can block direct access to](https://aka.ms/mszt)\n\nMicrosoft systems from unmanaged devices, but allow the employee to decide if they would like to enroll their\n\npersonal device into management in order to gain access. For unmanaged devices, we provide an alternative\n\n[access in the form of a rich desktop environment through Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD). Leveraging WVD](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2019/09/30/windows-virtual-desktop-generally-available-worldwide/)\n\nand Azure Firewall, we can control who accesses information via identified devices. Moreover, through the\n\nnature of this virtualized environment, we effectively prohibit the export of information from our Microsoft\ncontrolled environments while assuring our users’ productivity.\n\nAn additional risk, which is related to supply chain, is the manageability of devices not owned by the\n\norganization but being managed by another organization. A key aspect of this risk is the technical limitation\n\npreventing two device management solutions from being deployed on one system. For example, a partner\n\ndevice enrolled in the company’s device management system and using the policies defined by the company\n\ncould not also be enrolled in the Microsoft device management system and use the Microsoft policies.\n\nFurthermore, there would be no guarantee or real-time visibility into the compliance state of those policies. As a\n\nresult, the options are:\n\n1. Assume an implicit trust that the partner device is managed and has the appropriate policies deployed\n\nand monitored for health.\n\n2. Put an expectation in place that the partner must unenroll their device from their company management,\n\nwhich would make their device unable to access their own company resources. A security risk associated\n\nwith remote workforces, as well as third-party vendors and partners, is a personally owned, unmanaged\n\ndevice used from home that accesses organizational resources.\n\n3. Migrate the partner to a virtualized experience, providing them the ability to access resources where the\n\ndata and controls continue to be managed by the organization, and their company policies continue to\n\nbe managed on the device.\n\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n_[Security guidance for remote desktop adoption](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/16/security-guidance-remote-desktop-adoption/)_\n_[2020/04/16](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/16/security-guidance-remote-desktop-adoption/)_\n\n_[Enable a remote workforce by embracing Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust)_\n_[security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust)_\n\n_[Implementing Zero Trust with Microsoft Azure:](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevblogs.microsoft.com%2Fazuregov%2Fimplementing-zero-trust-with-microsoft-azure-identity-and-access-management-1-of-6%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cv-mpudas%40microsoft.com%7C7ca653a0177e4ff78ae008d7b03adcf9%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637171639166080066&sdata=R%2B4%2BWYHvChBkTK0yZAZ6f9XqRMBqoZ70zfxW%2FfkzIZ8%3D&reserved=0)_\n_[Identity and Access Management 2020/01/21](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevblogs.microsoft.com%2Fazuregov%2Fimplementing-zero-trust-with-microsoft-azure-identity-and-access-management-1-of-6%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cv-mpudas%40microsoft.com%7C7ca653a0177e4ff78ae008d7b03adcf9%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637171639166080066&sdata=R%2B4%2BWYHvChBkTK0yZAZ6f9XqRMBqoZ70zfxW%2FfkzIZ8%3D&reserved=0)_\n\n_[Zero Trust Strategy: What Good Looks Like](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/11/11/zero-trust-strategy-what-good-looks-like/)_\n_[2019/11/11](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/11/11/zero-trust-strategy-what-good-looks-like/)_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Devices and patch management \n\nWhile many IT departments supported remote work\n\nas an option, systems management strategies had\n\nbeen based on the assumption that hardware assets\n\nwould typically return to the corporate network after\n\nonly a short leave. This assumption, combined with\n\na desire to reduce the load on VPN concentrators\n\nand to avoid unapproved updates, led to policies\n\nthat prevent laptops from downloading updates\n\nwhen not on the corporate network, and then only\n\nfrom on-premises patch management systems. In\n\nother words, policies controlling settings were based\n\non architecture decisions made for a workforce\n\nexpected to return to the office on a regular basis\n\nand weren’t even being refreshed in some of these\n\nsystems. As the COVID-19 outbreak stretched\n\ninto its third month, many organizations were left\n\nstruggling with multiple rounds of missing critical\n\npatches. Having a remote workforce will necessitate\n\nshifts in how IT departments handle patches, as\n\nsystems management can’t rely on assets returning\n\nregularly to the corporate network.Best practice icon: our recommended controls.\n\n\nIT staff should review patching polices and\n\ncompliance regularly. If systems are governed by\n\npolicies that prevent them from receiving new\n\nupdates when not on the internal network, or are\n\nunable to receive new policies, consider alternate\n\nmethods to deliver policy changes. Cloud-based\n\nmanagement solutions and configuration scripts\n\ndeployed via VPN logons are some of the options\n\navailable. These alternatives can enable refreshed\n\nsettings on devices, allowing them to download\n\npatches directly from internet sources such as\n\nWindows Update instead of waiting to physically\n\nreturn to the organization’s internal network.\n\n\n###### Attacks on infrastructure: DDoS \n\nDDoS attacks are some of the largest availability and\n\nsecurity issues facing customers who are moving\n\ntheir applications to the cloud, making these attacks\n\na significant concern for a remote workforce. A\n\nDDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application’s\n\nresources, making the application unavailable to\n\nlegitimate users. This type of attack can be costly to\n\nthe business in terms of time, resources, and even\n\ncustomer attrition.\n\nDDoS attacks can be targeted at any endpoint that’s\n\npublicly reachable through the internet. While the\n\ntechnology to set up DDoS attacks continues to\n\nincrease in sophistication, they remain relatively\n\nsimple and low cost to launch. This low barrier for\n\nuse is driving up the frequency and ease with which\n\nbad actors can wreak havoc on both businesses\n\nand users.\n\nCybercriminals are leveraging the surge in internet\n\ntraffic owing to the COVID-19 outbreak (with more\n\nonline meetings, education settings, and other\n\nforms of virtual communication) to make DDoS\n\nattacks easier, because when trying to disrupt a site\n\n(such as banking, hospitals, or governments), the\n\nattackers don’t have to generate as much traffic for\n\n\nthe disruption. In addition to utilizing the increase\n\nin traffic, cybercriminals are looking to blend in with\n\nthe traffic stream to create attack traffic that’s harder\n\nto distinguish from bona fide traffic.\n\nDDoS attacks are often used as a smoke screen,\n\nobfuscating more malicious and harmful infiltrations\n\nof an organization’s resources. Disruption might\n\nbe intended solely to bring down a site or to keep\n\nthe security and IT personnel distracted from the\n\ncybercriminal’s actual intended target. This kind of\n\nmisdirection is a useful tool for cybercriminals. They\n\nmight attack the ”front door” of a company while\n\nworking on a back-end server that they find, keeping\n\nthe security team busy with what appears to be a\n\nhigher urgency issue of, say, keeping the company\n\nwebsite up. Furthermore, since more personnel are\n\nworking from home, responses might not be as\n\nefficient as they were previously.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In analyzing cloud-based incoming attacks ]\n\nas seen through Azure DDoS protection, Microsoft\n\nthreat researchers found that such attacks have been\n\nsignificant in terms of volume and occur on a regular\n\nbasis. Microsoft observed an increase in DDoS\n\nattacks during March 2020, following the COVID-19\n\noutbreak, continuing on an upward trend through\n\nApril. The company mitigated 600 to 1,000 unique\n\nDDoS attacks every day in March, or approximately\n\n50% more than pre-COVID-19 levels.

This concern is driven\n\nby a confluence of:\n\n - Growing privacy awareness in customers.\n\n - Increasing government regulation of how\n\nsensitive data is handled.\n\n - Needing to ensure that only the right people\n\nand system processes have access to sensitive\n\ninformation—and only when needed.\n\nAny new data estate added to an organization must\n\nbe accounted for as a new variable. Security teams\n\nmust work continuously to discover sensitive data\n\nand to classify, label, and protect it from all the\n\nvarious ingress and egress points in an ever-growing\n\nperimeter.\n\nWith remote workforces becoming the new\n\nparadigm, organizations’ information rights\n\nmanagement (IRM) practices need to permeate\n\nfurther into their remote working behaviors and\n\nsolutions, especially when working with sensitive\n\ninformation. This information can range from\n\nnew marketing campaigns and product design to\n\npatents, financial information, or images.\n\n\nWith workforces becoming more remote, more\n\nteams need to collaborate on these vital assets\n\nwithout being physically together. Organizations are\n\nrising to the challenge with increased use of IRM\n\nto enforce policies aimed at protecting confidential\n\ninformation and intellectual property.Telemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\n\n\n[With the changes in the workforce ]\n\nenvironment, we’ve observed IRM use growing at a\n\nsteady rate.

As the first line of defense to better protect users\n\nfrom account compromise, organizations leverage Azure AD’s MFA capabilities. MFA is a process in which the\n\nsystem prompts a user for an additional form of identification during sign-in, such as entering a code sent to\n\nanother device they own or providing a fingerprint scan. Organizations set authentication policies to define the\n\nconditions under which users can access resources. For example, a policy might enforce MFA when a user logs in\n\nfrom a new device, new location, or other criteria that enforce their security posture. Telemetry icon: here’s what we're seeing.\n\n[As a result of companies closing office access and limiting travel, user authentication patterns have ]\n\nchanged. We saw an approximate twofold increase in MFA-enablement requests after the onset of the COVID-19\n\noutbreak, as work-from-home policies were enacted.

Microsoft’s\n\nresearch of previous identity-related attacks\n\nindicates that more than 99% of password spray\n\nattacks use legacy authentication protocols, and\n\nmore than 97% of credential stuffing attacks use\n\nlegacy authentication. Given the frequency of\n\npasswords being guessed, phished, stolen with\n\nmalware, or reused, it’s critical for people to pair\n\npasswords with some form of strong credential.\n\nTherefore, disabling legacy authentication and\n\nenabling MFA is a critical call to action. Azure AD\n\naccounts in organizations that have disabled legacy\n\nauthentication experience 67% fewer compromises\n\nthan those in which legacy authentication is enabled.

According to a recent survey,\n\nthe lives of up to 300 million information workers worldwide have been upended, and many are now working\n\nremotely with limited resources and increased stress.[46] These employees are not only logging into enterprise\n\nenvironments and line-of-business applications but also accessing, editing, and sharing sensitive data.\n\n###### Organizations face a broad range of risks from insidersInfographic depicting risks from insiders: data spillage, confidentiality violations, IP theft, workplace violence, fraud, policy violations, insider trading, conflicts of interest, leaks of sensitive data, workplace harassment, corporate espionage, and regulatory compliance violations.\n\nWhile some of these activities might happen via a company-managed device, owing to the rapid progression\n\nof the pandemic, many information workers are working from their personal PCs or other shared devices.\n\nEmployees working from home can be subject to increased distractions, such as shared home workspaces and\n\nremote schooling for children. According to the SEI CERT institute,[47] user distractions are the cause of many\n\naccidental and non-malicious insider risks.\n\n\nIn addition, the current environment has significantly increased stressors such as potential job loss or health\n\nand safety concerns, which might lead to some employees participating in malicious activities, such as stealing\n\nintellectual property. An additional stressor to consider is the impact of the physical isolation and limited social\n\ninteraction that has resulted from the abrupt shift to a remote workforce.\n\n###### Stressors that increase insider risks in a remote work environment[48]\n\n\n-----\n\nUnderstanding and managing the complexities of insider risk requires a proactive approach, incorporating\n\norganizational, risk management, and cultural considerations.

They captured signals by using a user activity\n\nmonitoring solution and fed these signals into a\n\nseparate user entity behavior analytics solution,\n\nwith the hopes of finding the proverbial needle in\n\nthe haystack. We know from our own experience\n\nin attempting to deploy these complex types of\n\nsolutions at Microsoft that not only is the approach\n\nnot scalable, but often it results in a lot of noise, as\n\nthey lack enrichment, owing to limited visibility into\n\nthe sensitivity of the data and lack of\n\nbroader context.\n\nWhile having broad visibility into signals from\n\nend-user activities, actions, or communications is\n\nimportant, when it comes to effectively identifying\n\nthe risks, the quality of signals matters most.\n\n\nOn devices, we continue to leverage the agentless\n\ncapture of signals from Windows 10 endpoints to\n\ndeliver new signals, including:\n\n - Files transferred to network shares.\n\n - Files uploaded to unallowed domains.\n\n - Files downloaded from enterprise sites.\n\n - Files being renamed.\n\nWe’re leveraging Microsoft Defender Advanced\n\nThreat Protection to capture security signals on the\n\nendpoint about:\n\n - Defense evasion (disabling MFA).\n\n - Installation of unwanted software.\n\n\nIn the cloud, native integration with Microsoft 365\n\nallows us to capture billons of additional signals\n\nfrom Teams, SharePoint, and Exchange, including:\n\n - Sharing files, folders, or sites from SharePoint\n\nOnline to unallowed domains.\n\n - Downloading content from Teams.\n\n - Emailing outside the organization to\n\nunallowed domains.\n\nFinally, one of the key early indicators as to whether\n\nsomeone might choose to participate in malicious\n\nactivities is disgruntlement. We’re further enhancing\n\nour native HR connector to capture signals related\n\nto employee performance which might indicate\n\ndisgruntlement, including whether the user:\n\n - Is on a performance improvement plan.\n\n - Was recently demoted.\n\n   - Had a poor performance review.Best practice icon: our recommended controls.\n\n[Successful insider risk management programs ]\n\nare built on a framework to identify insider risks with\n\nintegrated processes which enable collaboration\n\nbetween key stakeholders across the organization\n\nto take action.

We must fold the lessons we’ve learned—\n\nand the various strategies that we deployed to\n\nsurvive the pandemic—into our broader\n\nenterprise vision.\n\nTo some degree, the enterprise response to\n\nCOVID-19 changed our operational procedures as\n\nwell as the very vocabulary that we use to describe\n\nthe reactive measures and lessons learned. Terms\n\nsuch as “extended security boundary,” “pandemic\n\nresilience,” and “human infrastructure” are now the\n\nsubject of executive analyses and board briefings\n\naround the globe. This new vocabulary highlights\n\nthe emergence of critical areas of resilience that\n\nenterprises traditionally didn’t scrutinize.\n\nBased on measures that have been put into place\n\nto improve our security posture and incorporate the\n\nlessons learned since the outbreak of COVID-19,\n\nthree critical areas have arisen to guide the drive\n\ntoward enterprise resilience. All three are anchored\n\nin planning for the unanticipated.\n\n\n###### Critical area 3\n\n**Validating the resilience of the human**\n\n**infrastructure**\n\nWith such a large percentage of the workforce\n\nphysically distant from management and other\n\ncoworkers, the potential of new risks around\n\nworkforce attrition, disengagement, and divestment\n\nneed to be examined in this new context. Corporate\n\nhuman resource departments are shifting their focus\n\nfrom discussion of work-life balance to work-life\n\nintegration. A key takeaway in the area of human\n\ninfrastructure is to embed practices that measure\n\nthe sustainability of the human capital that the\n\nenterprise has invested in, including its workforce,\n\nsuppliers, partners, and customers.\n\n_These three critical areas can serve as the basis for_\n\n_reinforcing enterprise strategy if their core constructs_\n\n_are already included in the vision. If they aren’t, they_\n\n_can be readily dovetailed into the vision and strategy_\n\n_as learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic and the_\n\n_response to it, in order to demonstrate and ensure_\n\n_enterprise resilience._\n\n**Go to Actionable Learnings**\n\n**[Learn more: The future of business resilience](https://clouddamcdnprodep.azureedge.net/gdc/gdcQ2AppM/original)**\n\n\n###### Critical area 1\n\n**Extending the enterprise security boundary**\n\n**beyond the on-site perimeter**\n\nThe unanticipated shift of such a large percentage of\n\nthe workforce to a remote work setting hasn’t only\n\ntransitioned work, data, and intellectual property\n\nfrom enterprise-managed facilities to workers’\n\nhomes, but it has also extended the security\n\nboundary beyond the enterprise facility’s perimeter.\n\nSecurity teams must now worry about the increased\n\nrisk of exfiltration or leakage of sensitive data. They\n\nmust be prepared to respond to breaches in the\n\nextended perimeters of the remote workforce’s\n\nkitchens and home offices. They must ensure\n\nthe security of assets, services, and infrastructure\n\nthat extend beyond the corporate perimeter, and\n\npossibly even beyond the management and control\n\nof corporate policy. They must ensure the privacy\n\nand confidentiality of data and any associated data\n\nsubject rights, and they must protect corporate\n\nintellectual property that’s distributed across\n\npotentially less secure home internet connections\n\nand varying grades of Wi-Fi systems and\n\ncommunication channels.\n\n\nThe strategies to support an extended security\n\nboundary include expanding VPN capabilities\n\nto implementing Zero Trust networking with\n\ncapabilities such as stronger identity management,\n\ndevice management and device health, alternate\n\naccess for unmanaged devices, stronger network\n\nsegmentation and isolation of resources, and checks\n\non application health.\n\n###### Critical area 2\n\n**Prioritizing resilient performance**\n\nJust as the pandemic challenged health officials\n\nto find ways of protecting public safety, its\n\neconomic implications stretched corporate leaders\n\nto contemplate how to sustain productivity\n\nthrough the massive lift-and-shift exercise where\n\nworkloads and workforces moved away from their\n\nfacilities. To better understand what needed to\n\nbe moved, corporations identified critical services\n\nand processes to ensure they weren’t abandoned\n\nby personnel who needed on-site or break-glass\n\naccess—in other words, a real-time demonstration\n\nof enterprise preparedness. In continuing to learn\n\nfrom this exercise in preparedness, enterprises\n\nneed to take a closer look at the productivity and\n\nperformance of critical services and processes.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 4\n### Actionable learnings\n\n###### Steps you can take today\n\n Contributing teams at Microsoft\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Steps you can take today\n\n Based on the information learned from the research and intelligence described in this report, we recommend organizations take a proactive approach to shoring up their security and resiliency by using the following controls.\n While all these learnings are valid and beneficial recommendations for a cybersecurity program, we’ve selected\n our most salient points for each chapter and mapped them with icons as shown below. \n\n\n###### State of Cybercri me, Nation State\n Threats, and Secur\n\n\n###### ity and the Remote\n Workforce.\n\n\n###### Icons representing a\n ll three chapters:\n\n\n###### Actionable learnings Chapter mapping\n\n\n###### Adopt MFA\n\nMulti-factor authentication can stop credential-based attacks dead in their tracks. Without access to the additional factor, the attacker\n\ncan’t access the account or protected resource. MFA should be mandatory for all admin accounts and is strongly recommended for all\n\nusers. The preferred method is to use an authenticator app rather than SMS or voice where possible.\n\n###### Go passwordless\n\nFor organizations that use modern technologies like Windows 10, we recommend going passwordless by using face authentication,\n\nfingerprints, or a PIN code. For organizations with applications or workloads that can’t be transitioned to passwordless, we recommend\n\nadopting a secure password management solution, such as a password locker or vault and requiring that employees use unique,\n\nrandomized passwords for access to all sensitive information and on all servers and devices, including IoT and IoT controllers and network\n\ninfrastructure such as switches, routers, and firewalls.Icon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Nation State Threats chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapter\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Actionable learnings Chapter mapping\n\n\n###### Use good email hygiene\n\nBecause 90% of attacks start with an email, preventing phishing (and its voicemail- and text-based variants, vishing and SMiShing) can\n\nlimit the opportunity for attackers to succeed. Email hygiene platforms that incorporate filtering on the way in and link checking, like\n\nSafelinks, when clicked (the way out) provide the most comprehensive protection. Consider limiting or disabling autoforwarding for email\n\nunless you have a strong business need for it.\n\n###### Modernize VPN architectures\n\nVirtual private networks enable secure communications back to a central point. However, most organizations have transitioned significant\n\namounts of workloads to the cloud, making it unnecessary to point 100% of traffic back to the corporate VPN concentrator. A split tunnel\n\nallows cloud traffic to connect to cloud resources securely, reducing load and overhead on the corporate VPN.\n\n###### Patch apps and systems\n\nVendors are continually making security improvements and fixes, so it’s important to ensure that apps or platforms are using the most up-to\ndate versions, including patches for existing VPN architectures. Ransomware operators and nation state actors have found network devices\n\nlike gateway and VPN appliances to be a practical target for intrusion. Apply all available security updates for VPN and firewall configurations.\n\nMonitor and pay special attention to remote access infrastructure. Any detections from security products or anomalies found in event logs\n\nshould be investigated immediately. In the event of a compromise, ensure that any account used on these devices has a password reset\n\nbecause the credentials could have been exfiltrated.\n\n###### Manage configuration changes\n\nMisconfigurations are another prominent attack vector and an example of how small changes can result in big problems. Implementing a\n\nrobust change management program enables companies to review changes before they’re made and confirm that the change won’t open\n\na new attack path or otherwise put the organization at risk.\n\n\n###### Icon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Nation State Threats chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapterIcon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Nation State Threats chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapterIcon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapter\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Actionable learnings Chapter mapping\n\n\n###### Implement a secure software development lifecycle\n\nEvery organization is engaged in software development, whether they write it themselves or purchase it from a vendor. Even if robust\n\ncontrols are in place lower in the stack, the organization is at risk if the app layer isn’t secure. We recommend a robust software\n\ndevelopment lifecycle that includes threat modeling, design reviews, and static and dynamic application testing, in addition to penetration\n\ntesting in production.\n\n###### Take a 3-2-1 approach to backups\n\nBackups are essential for resilience after an organization has been breached. Apply the 3-2-1 rule for maximum protection and availability:\n\n3 copies, original + 2 backups, 2 storage types, and 1 offsite or cold copy.\n\n###### Monitor cross-cloud security\n\nMost companies today use multiple cloud providers, and without visibility across all the clouds, including the IaaS and SaaS layers,\n\norganizations don’t have a complete view of their risk profile. Modern SOCs should leverage SIEM tools that can collect and analyze\n\nsignals from all clouds in use and leverage a cloud access security broker (CASB) as appropriate for audit and control of SaaS.\n\n###### Limit access with least privilege\n\nTo limit the risk of intentional, and unintentional, insider risk, practice the principle of least privilege and maintain good credential hygiene.\n\nAvoid the use of domain-wide, admin-level service accounts. Restricting local administrative privileges can help limit installation of remote\n\naccess trojans and other unwanted applications.\n\n\n######  Icon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Nation State Threats chapterIcon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Nation State Threats chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapter\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Actionable learnings Chapter mapping\n\n\n###### Leverage machine learning to increase fidelity and reduce alert fatigue\n\nThe explosion of data and signals has overwhelmed many SOCs and analysts. Look for modern SIEMs that use technologies like machine\n\nlearning to reduce the false positives and bubble up the alerts that really matter. ML can also help identify attackers that are using\n\nbehavioral-based attacks that might not be detected by traditional, rules-based systems.\n\n###### Closely monitor legacy, certified, and industrial control systems\n\nKeeping operating systems and apps patched and up to date is the best way to protect them. However, some systems can’t be upgraded\n\nor patched owing to restrictions like certification levels or business limitations. For devices and apps that can’t be patched or upgraded,\n\nadditional monitoring can be tuned to keep a closer eye on access and behavior of legacy devices. Segmentation (covered below) is also\n\nan important control here.\n\n###### Slow attacks with network segmentation\n\nWhen vulnerabilities are found on a number of systems, an attack can rip through a flat network in a matter of minutes. Additionally,\n\ndevices and systems with highly sensitive data often need to be protected at higher levels of control. Segmenting networks provides\n\nsecurity to limit the spread of attacks and enables organizations to place stricter controls in front of sensitive enclaves. Segmentation can\n\nalso help to protect unpatched or unpatchable systems from attack.\n\n###### Network design\n\n##### Inf\n\nographic depicting benefit of network s\negmentation.\n\n\n######  Icon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Nation State Threats chapterIcon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Nation State Threats chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapter\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Actionable learnings Chapter mapping\n\n\n###### Manage the convergence of OT and IT\n\nTraditionally cordoned-off OT networks are converging with IT networks. Many OT networks relied on segmentation and access controls\n\nfor security, but as they’re opened to the internet and the cloud, they’re increasingly overlapping with IT. Organizations must have a\n\nstrategy in place to protect OT post-convergence.\n\n###### Secure IoT and IIoT\n\nThe IoT and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are pushing the boundary of security management. Many IIoT devices are legacy\n\nbrownfield and dependent on older OT-type protections. For comprehensive security, organizations must bring IoT and IIoT into their\n\nsecurity program, with management and governance for the legacy devices and systems, and by building out modern, trusted solutions\n\n[for greenfield deployments. For more on this approach, see The Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SevenPropertiesofHighlySecureDevices.pdf)\n\n###### Know your perimeter\n\nEndpoints are a common target for attackers. Weak endpoints can become beachheads for network infiltration and reconnaissance\n\nactivity. With the COVID-19-driven shift to remote workforces, endpoints are farther away from the corporate network and sprawling with\n\nnew software installs for video conferencing and other collaborative activities. A robust endpoint detection and response solution must be\n\ninstalled on endpoints to keep them protected, and some form of endpoint management is strongly recommended.\n\n###### Limit perimeter exposure\n\nUnderstand and control perimeter exposure. Attacks often start with devices that aren’t in asset inventories but are still members of the\n\nprimary Active Directory domain. These devices often have matching local admin passwords or service accounts with highly privileged\n\ndomain credentials logging on to them. To limit perimeter exposure, an organization needs an up-to-date inventory that includes all\n\nmembers of the Active Directory domain, and these devices should be monitored and managed. Perimeter exposure can also be managed\n\non the network by implementing segmentation (via switches, routers, firewalls) and throughout the cloud with solutions such as CASBs.Icon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the State of Cybercrime chapterIcon representing the Nation State Threats chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapterIcon representing the Security and the Remote Workforce chapter\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Actionable learnings Chapter mapping\n\n\n###### Build a third-party risk program\n\nPartners, suppliers, and contractors interact with data and applications connected to an organization’s corporate environments, and\n\nattackers are increasingly targeting providers, like MSSPs, in order to gain access to the MSSP’s clients’ credentials and networks. This\n\nmeans that your partner’s risk is your inherited risk, and it should be managed through robust service level agreements, attestations, and\n\nshared assessments like SSAE 18 SOC 1 and SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and ISO 20001.\n\n###### Invest in user training (and keep training)\n\nUsers can be the weakest link or the first line of defense. When security awareness is institutionalized at an organizational level, end users\n\ncan be the early responders to activity that might indicate compromise. Train users on what attacks look like and provide them with a way\n\nto report unusual activity.\n\n###### Adopt a Zero Trust mindset\n\nInstead of assuming everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, assume breach and verify each request as though it originates from\n\nan open network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, every request is fully authenticated, authorized,\n\nand encrypted before granting access.
