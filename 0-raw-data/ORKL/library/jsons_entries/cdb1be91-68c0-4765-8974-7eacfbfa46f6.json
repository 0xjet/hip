The defendants in some instances acted for their own personal financial gain,\nand in others for the benefit of the MSS or other Chinese government agencies. The\nhackers stole terabytes of data which comprised a sophisticated and prolific threat to U.S.\nnetworks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe 11-count indictment alleges LI Xiaoyu (李啸宇), 34, and DONG Jiazhi (董家志), 33, who\nwere trained in computer applications technologies at the same Chinese university,\nconducted a hacking campaign lasting more than ten years to the present, targeting\ncompanies in countries with high technology industries, including the United States,\nAustralia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea,\nSweden, and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, high tech\nmanufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and\ngaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; defense. In at least one instance, the\nhackers sought to extort cryptocurrency from a victim entity, by threatening to release the\nvictim’s stolen source code on the Internet. More recently, the defendants probed for\nvulnerabilities in computer networks of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing\ntechnology, and treatments.\n\nThe charges were announced by Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C.\nDemers; FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of\nWashington William D. Hyslop; and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Seattle Field\nDivision Raymond Duda.\n\n“China has now taken its place, alongside Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that shameful\nclub of nations that provide a safe haven for cyber criminals in exchange for those criminals\nbeing ‘on call’ to work for the benefit of the state, here to feed the Chinese Communist\nparty’s insatiable hunger for American and other non-Chinese companies’ hard-earned\nintellectual property, including COVID-19 research,” said Assistant Attorney General for\nNational Security John C. Demers.\n\n“Today’s indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese MSS and its\nproxies will face if they continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they\ncannot create or silence what they do not want to hear,” said FBI Deputy Director David\nBowdich. “Cybercrimes directed by the Chinese government’s intelligence services not only\nthreaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international\nnorms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's desire to become a\nrespected leader in world affairs. The FBI and our international partners will not stand idly by\nto this threat, and we are committed to holding the Chinese government accountable.”\n\n“The cybercrime hacking occurring here was first discovered on computers of the\nDepartment of Energy’s Hanford Site in Eastern Washington. As the grand jury charged, the\ncomputer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United\nStates and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive\nand valuable trade secrets, technologies, data, and personal information being stolen. The\nhackers operated from China both for their own gain and with the assistance and for the\nbenefit of the Chinese government’s Ministry of State Security. This prosecution is occurring\nas a result of the combined unwavering efforts of the National Security Division of the\nDepartment of Justice, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of\n\n\n-----\n\nWashington, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We seek justice for these victims and\nothers affected and we intend to prosecute these defendants for their alleged crimes,” said\nU.S. Attorney William D. Hyslop for the District Eastern District of Washington.\n\n\"The complicated nature of cyber investigations is only exacerbated when the criminal is\nbacked by the resources of a foreign government. The nature and value of the material\nstolen by these hackers cannot just be measured in dollars and was indicative of being state\ndriven. This case demonstrates the FBI's dedication to pursuing these criminals no matter\nwho is sanctioning their activities,” said Special Agent in Charge Raymond Duda of the FBI’s\nSeattle Division.\n\nAccording to the indictment, to gain initial access to victim networks, the defendants primarily\nexploited publicly known software vulnerabilities in popular web server software, web\napplication development suites, and software collaboration programs. In some cases, those\nvulnerabilities were newly announced, meaning that many users would not have installed\npatches to correct the vulnerability. The defendants also targeted insecure default\nconfigurations in common applications. The defendants used their initial unauthorized\naccess to place malicious web shell programs (e.g., the “China Chopper” web shell) and\ncredential-stealing software on victim networks, which allowed them to remotely execute\ncommands on victim computers.\n\nTo conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the\ndefendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files\n(RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents’ names and extensions (e.g., from “.rar”\nto “.jpg”) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuousseeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks’ “recycle bins.” The defendants\nfrequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from\nwhich they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data\ntheft. In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to\nthe efforts of the FBI and network defenders.\n\nThe indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets from at least\neight known victims, which consisted of technology designs, manufacturing processes, test\nmechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures. Such\ninformation would give competitors with a market edge by providing insight into proprietary\nbusiness plans and savings on research and development costs in creating competing\nproducts.\n\nThe defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud,\nwhich carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit\ntheft of trade secrets, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison; one count of\nconspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison;\none count of unauthorized access of a computer, which carries a maximum sentence of five\n\n\n-----\n\nyears in prison; and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, which each carries a\nmandatory sentence of two non-consecutive years in prison. The maximum potential\nsentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational\npurposes only, as any sentencings of the defendants will be determined by the assigned\njudge.\n\nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District\nof Washington, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice, and the FBI’s\nSpokane Resident Agency and San Antonio and Norfolk Field Offices. The FBI’s Cyber\nDivision assisted in the investigation and, along with FBI’s Cyber Assistant Legal Attachés\nand Legal Attachés in countries around the world, provided essential support. Numerous\nvictims cooperated and provided valuable assistance in the investigation.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney James Goeke of the Eastern District of Washington and Trial\nAttorney Scott McCulloch of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export\nControl Section are prosecuting this case.\n\nThe details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendants are\npresumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\n\n-----",
