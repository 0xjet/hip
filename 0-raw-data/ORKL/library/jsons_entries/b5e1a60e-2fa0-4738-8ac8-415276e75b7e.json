Amongst the well-established families (Ryuk,\nMaze, REvil) we now have another to add to the list…”�Snake”�.\n\n[SentinelLabs has observed the Snake ransomware in targeted campaigns over the last](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1215196590165647360)\nmonth. While it contains all the hallmarks of standard ransomware, there are a few traits that\nmake it stand out as more aggressive and more complex.\n\nSnake is written in Golang, which has been seen in many recent ransomware families.\nGolang is an open-source programming language, with a degree of cross-platform support. It\nis for these same reasons that some RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) offerings utilize the\n[language as well. One such example would be Project Root.](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/behind-enemy-lines-looking-into-raas-project-root/)\n\nUpon infection, relevant files are overwritten with encrypted data. Each modified file is also\n‘tagged’ at the end of the file with the string “EKANS” (Snake backwards).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the names of modified files are appended with random characters, rather than a\nsingular or uniform extension change. This, in theory, makes it more difficult to identify the\nspecific ransomware family simply by the file extensions.\n\nThe actual encryption process is achieved via a mix of symmetric and asymmetric\ncryptography (across AES-256 and RSA-2048). A symmetric key is required for encrypting\nand decrypting of files. Said symmetric key is encrypted with the attacker’s public key.\nDecryption is only possible with possession of the attacker’s private key. This mixture, along\nwith the key lengths (AES-256, RSA-2048), aims to make 3rd party decryption difficult or\nimpossible.\n\nThe malware excludes critical system files and folders from encryption. In parallel, it\nattempts to encrypt data on adjacent and available network resources. Current analysis\nindicates that any decryption purchased from the attacker covers the scope of the targeted\nnetwork rather than individual files.\n\nAs with most modern ransomware, Snake attempts to remove Volume Shadow Copies that\nthe OS uses for backup. The ransomware also attempts to terminate various processes. It\nappears to be targeting those associated with SCADA platforms, enterprise management\n\n\n-----\n\ntools, system utilities and the like. Some specifically targeted applications include VMware\nTools, Microsoft System Center Operations Manager, Nimbus, Honeywell HMIWeb, FLEXnet,\nand more. A full list of the terminated processes is as follows:\n\nIf the threat is executed with administrative privileges, the ransom note will be written to\n```\nc:userspublicdesktopFix-Your-Files.txt . In the event that administrative privileges\n\n```\nare not present, the ransom note will be written to an alternative location:\n\n```\nc:usersAppDataLocalVirtualStore\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe ransom note provides fairly straightforward details on how the victim should proceed\n(according to the attacker). Rather than providing a web address to obtain a payment\naddress and further details, victims are instructed to initiate direct contact via email. Note the\nemail address in the ransom note is “bapcocrypt @ ctemplar.com”�. BAPCO (The Bahrain\nPetroleum Company) was the target of the recent ‘Dustman’ campaign. There may very well\nbe a relationship between the Snake and ‘Dustman’ attacks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSnake, like other targeted ransomware campaigns, has the potential to do serious and\ncritical damage to an infected environment. As always we should stay aware and vigilant,\nand aggressively defend environments against this type of attack. Part of this strategy comes\n\n\n-----\n\ndown to properly choosing, deploying, and maintaining a modern endpoint protection\ntechnology. It is also critical to have functional and well-tested backup procedures in place as\npart of your greater business continuity and disaster recovery planning.\n\n## References\n\nThanks to [@VK_Intel and](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1215196590165647360) [sysopfb for their insights about this ransomware.](https://github.com/sysopfb/open_mal_analysis_notes)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**\n```\nSHA-256: e5262db186c97bbe533f0a674b08ecdafa3798ea7bc17c705df526419c168b60\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n```\n\n-----",
