If the victim double clicks the \"document.lnk\", the DLL\nlaunches to set up the IcedID loader.\n\nThe IcedID GZiploader is stored in an encrypted form in the resource section of the binary,\nand after decoding, it's placed in memory and executed.\n\nThe host is then fingerprinted and the basic system information is sent to the C2\n(yourgroceries[.]top) via an HTTP GET request.\n\nFinally, the C2 responds by sending a payload to the infected machine, although that step\nwas not performed during Intezer's analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dynamically called function that fetches the payload** _(Interzer)_\n\n## Ties to November 2021 campaign\n\n[While Intezer's report focuses on current and ongoing activity, it is unclear when this](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/conversation-hijacking-campaign-delivering-icedid/)\ncampaign started. It is possible that it started five months ago.\n\nIn November 2021, a Trend Micro report described a wave of attacks using ProxyShell and\nProxyLogon vulnerabilities in exposed Microsoft Exchange servers to hijack internal email\nreply-chains and spread malware-laced documents.\n\nThe actors behind that campaign were believed to be 'TR', known to work with a plethora of\nmalware, including Qbot, IcedID, and SquirrelWaffle.\n\nWe have been seeing the TR Distro actor (we call them ChaserLdr) utilize\ncompromised Exchange servers vulnerable to Proxylogon/ProxyShell to send\nmalspam for about 1 week with artifacts indicating access going back to earlyOCT. 1/x\n[https://t.co/paoo2VM4sU](https://t.co/paoo2VM4sU)\n\n[— Cryptolaemus (@Cryptolaemus1) November 1, 2021](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1455264060644204550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nAll three malware pieces have been previously involved in email thread hijacking to deliver\n[malicious payloads [1,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-steals-your-email-threads-again-to-infect-other-victims/) [2,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-these-are-the-building-blocks-of-qbot-malware-attacks/) [3,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-servers-hacked-in-internal-reply-chain-attacks/) [4].](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spammers-use-squirrelwaffle-malware-to-drop-cobalt-strike/)\n\nIntezer puts threat group TA551 in the spotlight this time due to the use of regsvr32.exe for\nthe DDL's binary proxy execution and password-protected ZIP files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe link between those two threat groups is unclear, though, but it s not improbable that\nthere's some overlap or even underlying connection there.\n\n## Update your Exchange servers\n\n[We're approaching the one-year mark since Microsoft published fixes for the ProxyLogon](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-fixes-actively-exploited-exchange-zero-day-bugs-patch-now/)\n[and ProxyShell vulnerabilities, so applying the latest security updates is well overdue.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-admins-to-urgently-patch-exchange-proxyshell-bugs/)\n\nNot doing so leaves your Exchange servers, company, and employees prey to phishing\nactors, cyber-espionage, and ransomware infections.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[New IceApple exploit toolset deployed on Microsoft Exchange servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-iceapple-exploit-toolset-deployed-on-microsoft-exchange-servers/)\n\n[Cyberspies use IP cameras to deploy backdoors, steal Exchange emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberspies-use-ip-cameras-to-deploy-backdoors-steal-exchange-emails/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Microsoft Exchange servers hacked to deploy Hive ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-servers-hacked-to-deploy-hive-ransomware/)\n\n[Banking Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/banking-trojan/)\n[IcedID](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/icedid/)\n[Microsoft Exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft-exchange/)\n[ProxyShell](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/proxyshell/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
