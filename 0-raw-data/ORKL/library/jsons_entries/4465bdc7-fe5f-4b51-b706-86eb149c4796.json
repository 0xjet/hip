If so, the data on the domain controller will not be deleted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is likely a tactic used by the attackers to maintain access inside the compromised\nnetworks of organizations they hit while still heavily disturbing operations by wiping other\ncritical devices.\n\nWhile analyzing the PE header of a malware sample discovered on the network of an\nundisclosed Ukrainian organization, it was also discovered that the malware was deployed\nin attacks the same day it was compiled.\n\n\"CaddyWiper does not share any significant code similarity with HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper,\nor any other malware known to us. The sample we analyzed was not digitally signed,\"\nESET added.\n\n\"Similarly to HermeticWiper deployments, we observed CaddyWiper being deployed via\nGPO, indicating the attackers had prior control of the target's network beforehand.\"\n\n_[CadddyWiper compilation date (ESET)](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1503436437848571914)_\n\n## Fourth data wiper deployed in Ukraine this year\n\nCaddyWiper is the fourth data wiper malware deployed in attacks in Ukraine since the start\nof 2022, with ESET Research Labs analysts previously discovering two others and\nMicrosoft a third.\n\nOne day before the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, on February 23rd, ESET\n[researchers spotted a data-wiping malware now known as HermeticWiper, used to target](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-data-wiping-malware-used-in-destructive-attacks-on-ukraine/)\n[Ukraine together with ransomware decoys.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-used-as-decoy-in-data-wiping-attacks-on-ukraine/)\n\n[They also discovered a data wiper they dubbed IsaacWiper and a new worm named](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-worm-and-data-wiper-malware-seen-hitting-ukrainian-networks/)\nHermeticWizard the attackers used to drop HermeticWiper wiper payloads, deployed the\nday Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n[Microsoft also found a wiper now tracked as WhisperGate, used in data-wiping attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-fake-ransomware-targets-ukraine-in-data-wiping-attacks/)\nagainst Ukraine in mid-January, disguised as ransomware.\n\nAs Microsoft President and Vice-Chair Brad Smith said, these ongoing attacks with\ndestructive malware against Ukrainian organizations \"have been precisely targeted.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThis contrasts with the indiscriminate NotPetya worldwide malware assault that hit Ukraine\n[and other countries in 2017, an attack later linked to Sandworm, a Russian GRU Main](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-indicts-russian-gru-sandworm-hackers-for-notpetya-worldwide-attacks/)\nIntelligence Directorate hacking group.\n\n[Such destructive attacks are part of a \"massive wave of hybrid warfare,\" as the Ukrainian](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-says-it-s-targeted-by-massive-wave-of-hybrid-warfare-/)\nSecurity Service (SSU) described them right before the war started.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Sandworm hackers fail to take down Ukrainian energy provider](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sandworm-hackers-fail-to-take-down-ukrainian-energy-provider/)\n\n[Viasat confirms satellite modems were wiped with AcidRain malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/viasat-confirms-satellite-modems-were-wiped-with-acidrain-malware/)\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Phishing attacks target countries aiding Ukrainian refugees](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-attacks-target-countries-aiding-ukrainian-refugees/)\n\n[Beware: Onyx ransomware destroys files instead of encrypting them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-onyx-ransomware-destroys-files-instead-of-encrypting-them/)\n\n[CaddyWiper](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/caddywiper/)\n[Data-wiper](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-wiper/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ukraine/)\n[Wiper](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/wiper/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
