By doing this,\nthey ultimately increase the success rate of their fraudulent operations. According to CERTGIB data, an average phishing page's lifespan is about 24 hours; the phishing pages that\nused the new approach lived six days on average.\n\nGroup-IB analysts identified multiple phishing websites impersonating Dutch financial\norganizations that are part of a single network of more than 750 connected domains. The\nphishing infrastructure was first seen in March 2021 and remains active until today. The\ncampaign was codenamed RUNLIR by Group-IB researchers, as it uses RU, NL and IR in\nthe domain naming pattern. As part of the analysis, Group-IB researchers also observed a\nvery unconventional \"Cut the card\" phishing scheme that requires fraudsters' efforts both\nonline and offline.\n\nRUNLIR uses the combination unique for the Netherlands that involves the BlackTDS antibot service, the notorious bulletproof hosting services of Yalishanda and different versions of\nthe uAdmin phishing kit. This approach ensures that their phishing pages are only shown to\nvictims and not to security professionals.\n\nThe cybercriminals use this approach as it allows them to distinguish between unsuspecting\nvictims and security researchers by checking if the page viewer is connecting using a Dutch\nmobile network to narrow down their reach. Nevertheless, Group-IB researchers quickly\nestablished the necessary access conditions and upgraded their Threat Intelligence &\nAttribution system with a specific proxy server to bypass these restrictions. The approach,\ndiscovered by Group-IB CERT analysts, is new and has not been seen in phishing attacks in\nthe Netherlands in the past.\n\nThis blog post offers a comprehensive analysis of the unusual phishing campaign in which\nthe unconventional approach was first seen and a detailed description of it.\n**\"Cut the card\" phishing scheme**\n\nAmong Group-IB's customers are leading Dutch financial organizations. As part of the\nregular monitoring and blocking efforts, CERT-GIB analysts discovered a phishing campaign\nimpersonating Dutch financial organizations, including its customers. The campaign, which\ntargeted Dutch residents, began as early as March 2021. CERT-GIB was able to take down\nthose websites related to its customers immediately upon detection.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, further analysis revealed that these phishing resources were part of a network of\nmore than 750 connected domains used by the criminals to host phishing pages\nimpersonating banks, transportation, logistics, government, telecom, housing, marketplace,\nand utility companies to target users in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and other\ncountries. It must be considered that each of the domains has an average of three\nsubdomains, every one of which is able to host different phishing pages. The campaign was\ncodenamed RUNLIR by the Group-IB Threat Intelligence team, due to the phishing domains\nnaming pattern.\n\nThe phishing infrastructure shown on the Group-IB Network Graph below has been on our\nradar since March 2021. CERT-GIB eliminated the websites related to its customers and is\ncontinuing to monitor the infrastructure as phishing domains tend to reappear after some\ntime.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phishing infrastructure relies on the infamous Yalishanda bulletproof hosting provider\nand uses the FastFlux technique. This infrastructure is used to make the phishing sites more\nresilient to take downs by global CERT teams. The sites use the BlackTDS anti-bot service\nand only accept mobile devices as visitors. The cybercriminals' approach by using the\nYalishanda bulletproof hosting in combination with the BlackTDS services allows them to\nmitigate unwanted eyes on the RUNLIR phishing campaign. BlackTDS is a cybercrime-as-aservice provider that provides the following services: anti-detection, traffic distribution\ntowards exploit kits, availability of domains that can be used for malicious campaigns like\nphishing. The usage of Yalishanda, BlackTDS and customized forks of uAdmin increases the\nlikelihood of successful campaigns. The detailed analysis of the combination of tools can be\nfound in the next section of the post.\n\nThe investigation into the phishing infrastructure itself revealed that various local brands\nwere being impersonated, but there was one specific scheme that caught the attention of our\nanalysts. The unorthodox scheme instructs the victims to cut up their banking cards. It is for\nthat reason that we will take a dive into this phishing attack impersonating one of the Dutch\nbanks.\n\nThe specialized 'Cut up your banking card' scheme observed by Group-IB researchers,\ntypically has 5 steps. The victim count is unknown, however, according to Dutch media\nreports local residents fell prey to a variation of the scheme in June 2021. Below you can find\na step-by step guide into the phishing scheme.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial vector, just like with many phishing campaigns, is smishing. The victim receives a\nrogue SMS impersonating a local organization, which warns the users that their banking card\nexpires soon, and that they need to follow the link in order to prevent blockage. The smishing\nmessage also informs the victim that the request to get a new card will be free.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, after clicking on the link, the unsuspecting victim is requested to provide their banking\ninformation, including the e.dentifier response token. The e.dentifier is the physical token tool\nused by the customers of Dutch banks to generate a secure token, which must be used\nduring the login process. Once the cybercriminals have logged in with the stolen token, they\nwill be in full control of the customer's banking account. In the online banking account, they\ncan see the amount of money the victim has, and they are able to find additional information,\nsuch as addresses.\n\n**The websites from the screenshots provided below were blocked by the CERT-GIB**\n**team immediately upon detection.**\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the response token is sent to cybercriminals, the phishing website prompts the victim to\nshare all the personal data, including their name, full address, postal code, DOB, phone\nnumber, and email address. Phishers often request more information than the minimum that\nis required. Thus, the crooks have higher chances to capitalize on it by selling the data on\nthe dark web, for example. This information also allows the criminals to perform a quick scan\non the web to obtain a photo of their victim, which, if needed, can be used in their attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe criminals then ask the victim to share the PIN number of their existing bank card to use it\nto steal money later. Additionally, they request that the victim provide a \"new PIN code\",\nwhich leads the victim to believe that they are dealing with the legitimate website of their\nbank and their existing card is not usable anymore.\n\nIn the following step, the victim is instructed to cut the card in two; the cut has to be made\nthrough the center of the card. In fact, this step actually does not disable the functionality of\nthe payment card as the chip itself remains untouched. The victim is then requested to\nprovide a 'time' at which a 'banking employee' can come to pick up the card that has been\n'cut in two'.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the next step, the victim needs to select a window of time for the appointment with the\n\"bank employee\" to take place. This \"employee\" will come to pick up the card that has been\ncut in half. This card, of course, remains functional.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe last step is the official page and website of the bank that the crooks impersonated. In\nthis stage, the phishers have collected all the information that they need.\n\nAt the end of this scheme, the cybercriminals have all of the information needed to login and\nabuse the victim's bank account. The card of the victim can be fixed by simply using some\ntape, and, as the crooks have access to their bank account, they can come and pick the old\ncard from the victim's physical mailbox.\n\n\n-----\n\nThey are also able to request a new bank card. Just like with a card cut in half, the crooks\ncan get the bank card to the victim's address and pick it up once it has arrived. They will wait\nfor the delivery, and once the card has been delivered, the criminals will force themselves\ninto obtaining the newly sent card.\n**Information theft**\n\nWhen analysing the phishing websites targeted at Dutch residents involved in the RUNLIR\ncampaign, Group-IB researchers discovered that the campaign attempts to steal the user\ninformation via verwerk1.php. In this specific PHP file, code is provided that requests the\ninformation from the victim via text boxes. Once the values have been provided into the\ntextbox, they will be transferred to the code that is responsible for storing the information.\n\nThe code itself appears to be a genuine financial environment. It is also worth mentioning\nthat the campaign continues to utilize sources taken from the official target environment. The\ncybercriminal(s) behind this campaign use this technique as it allows them to quickly set up\nthe phishing resource. Each customization can, of course, be a trigger for the victim to\nidentify that they are dealing with a phishing/malicious site.\n\nThe RUNLIR campaign itself uses a domain generation pattern, which has a preference for\nutilizing a specific prefix, numeric values, and various top-level domains such as '.IR', and\n'.RU'.\n\n**Cybercrime takes advantage of legitimate security tools**\n\nWhen trying to access resources involved in the RUNLIR campaign from their regular\nworkstation, CERT-GIB analysts would always receive the answer seen below in the image.\n\nDeeper analysis revealed that the phishers were using the BlackTDS GEO tracking service\nwhen a visitor tried to access the page\n\n\n-----\n\nCybersecurity professionals use GEO tracking to verify that their users/visitors are from the\nexpected region. For example, a work environment that should only be accessible from the\nNetherlands does not need to allow connections from Germany. This same concept is now\nused by BlackTDS to allow cybercriminals to narrow down their reach. There is also a further\nreason why the criminals might use this technique; it gives them control of the victims they\nhunt down. We have seen this happen before with Russian malware, which would not run on\nsystems using the Russian language.\n\nEvery system with a connection to the web has to make use of an internet routing path, and\nthese internet routing paths are controlled by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). This means\nthat your mobile device will use a different route to a page when compared to a system in the\noffice.\n\nThe route can be explained as the system utilizing a different network. Your phone might use\nthe mobile network provided by your mobile internet provider, and your local system might\nuse your home or office network.\n\nThe RUNLIR campaign utilizes the following services to block unwanted visitors from their\nphishing websites and increase the likelihood of successful phishing attempts:\n\n**BlackTDS**\n\n- They require the browser's user-agent to be a mobile user-agent\n\n- They require the visiting IP address to connect from a mobile network\n\n- They can detect the referrer URL and take action based on that.\n\n- They make use of available domain patterns\n\n**Yalishanda**\n\n- Infamous bulletproof hosting service that hinders takedown efforts significantly\n\n**Phishing Kits**\n\n- Various versions of the U-Admin phishing panel, that allow cybercriminals to interact with\nthe actual phishing site in real time and are used to collect and manage the stolen user data\nThe phishing campaign uses the combination of the above tools to exclude unwanted\nvisitors, namely cybersecurity researchers and CERT teams, from their websites.\n\n\n-----\n\nNevertheless, Group-IB researchers were able to bypass the cybercriminals' detect evasion\nmethods by setting up a proxy that uses mobile networks, and the websites revealed\nthemselves:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fact that cybercriminals have begun adopting this method is a clear indication that the\nthreat actors and their phishing campaigns are continuously evolving. Hence, it's really\nimportant to constantly study cybercriminals' TTPs.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n\n-----\n\nHere are some steps that regular users can take to better protect themselves against these\ntypes of threats.\n\n1. Do not click on links that you are not 100% confident are real\n2. Double check that URL of a website is the official one before you submit any\n\ninformation\n3. If you think you may have been a victim of a phishing attack, quickly get in contact with\n\nyour bank, the organization being impersonated by the fraudsters, and the police. They\ncan issue an alert, which may ultimately raise awareness and reduce the victim count.\n4. Keep in mind that usually official organizations do not use common URL shorteners, so\n\nlinks leading to bit.ly, s.id, tny.sh and others, should be treated with suspicion. You\nshould double check the final destination.\n5. Always use your official banking application on your mobile device.\n[6.
