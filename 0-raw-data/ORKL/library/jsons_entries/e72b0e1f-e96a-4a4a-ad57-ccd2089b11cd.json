The analysis\nshowed the malware to have a few quite unpleasant features. It can spread itself over a local\nnetwork via an exploit, provide access to the attacked network, and install miners and other\nmalicious software on victim computers. What’s more, the backdoor is modular, which means\nthat its functionality can be expanded with the aid of plugins, as required. Post-analysis, the\nmalware was named Backdoor.Win32.Plurox.\n\n## Key features\n\n\n-----\n\nPlurox is written in C and complied with Mingw GCC, and judging by the presence of debug\nlines, the malware was at the testing stage when detected.\n\n_Debug lines in the samples we found_\n\nThe backdoor uses the TCP protocol to communicate with the C&C server; plugins are\nloaded and directly interfaced via two different ports, which are stitched into the body of\nPlurox; the C&C addresses are also hardcoded into the bot. When monitoring the malware’s\nactivity, we detected two “subnets.” In one, Plurox receives only miners (auto_proc,\nauto_cuda, auto_gpu_nvidia modules) from the C&C center, while in the other, besides\nminers (auto_opencl_amd, auto_miner), it is passed several plugins, which will be discussed\nlater.\n\nThe Plurox family has virtually no encryption, only a few 4-byte keys are applied for the\nregular XOR cipher. The packet for calling the C&C server looks as follows:\n\nThe buffer contains an XORed string with the key at the start of the packet. The response\nfrom the C&C center contains the command to be executed, plus data for its execution,\nwhich is encrypted using XOR. When the plugin is loaded, the bot itself selects the required\nbitness and requests both auto_proc and auto_proc64. In response there arrives a packet\nwith an encrypted plugin, the usual MZ-PE.\n\n## Supported commands\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Plurox version we found supports a total of seven commands:\n\nDownload and run files using WinAPI CreateProcess\nUpdate bot\nDelete and stop (delete own service, remove from autoload, delete files, remove\nartifacts from registry)\nDownload and run plugin\nStop plugin\nUpdate plugin (stop process and delete file of old version, load and start new one)\nStop and delete plugin\n\n## Plugins\n\nDuring the monitoring, we managed to detect several Plurox plugins and study them all.\n\n### Plugin miners\n\nThe malware can install on the victim computer one of several cryptocurrency miners,\ndepending on the particular system configuration. The bot sends the package with the\nsystem configuration to the C&C server, and in response it receives information about which\nplugin to download. We counted eight mining modules in total, whose features can be\nguessed from their names:\n\nauto_proc\n\n\n-----\n\nauto_cuda\nauto_miner\nauto_opencl_amd\nauto_gpu_intel\nauto_gpu_nvidia\nauto_gpu_cuda\nauto_gpu_amd\n\n### UPnP plugin\n\nThe module receives from the C&C a subnet with mask /24, retrieves all IP addresses from\nit, and attempts to forward ports 135 (MS-RPC) and 445 (SMB) for the currently selected IP\naddress on the router using the UPnP protocol. If successful, it reports the result to the C&C\ncenter, waits for 300 seconds (5 minutes), and then deletes the forwarded ports. We assume\nthat this plugin can be used to attack a local network. It would take an attacker just five\nminutes to sort through all existing exploits for services running on these ports. If the\nadministrators notice the attack on the host, they will see the attack coming directly from the\nrouter, not from a local machine. A successful attack will help the cybercriminals gain a\nfoothold in the network.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to its description, the plugin is very similar to EternalSilence, except that port 135\n[is forwarded instead of 139. See this Akamai article for details of EternalSilence:](https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2018/11/upnproxy-eternalsilence.html)\n\n{\"NewProtocol\": \"TCP\", \"NewInternalPort\": \"445\", \"NewInternalClient\": \"192.168.10.165\",\n\n\"NewPortMappingDescription\": \"galleta silenciosa\", \"NewExternalPort\": \"47622\"}\n\nAnd here’s the Plurox plugin template:\n\n<NewProtocol>TCP</NewProtocol>\n<NewInternalPort>%d</NewInternalPort>\n<NewInternalClient>%s</NewInternalClient>\n<NewEnabled>1</NewEnabled>\n<NewPortMappingDescription>galleta silenciosa</NewPortMappingDescription>\n\nIn the two examples, a matching line is highlighted — a description of port forwarding.\n\n### SMB plugin\n\nThis module is responsible for spreading malware over the network using the EternalBlue\n[exploit. It is identical to the wormDll32 module from Trojan.Win32.Trickster, but with no](https://threats.kaspersky.com/en/threat/Trojan.Win32.Trickster/)\ndebug lines in the code, plus the payload in the exploit is loaded using sockets.\n\n_Left: Plurox SMB plugin injected code, right: WormDll injected code_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Left: Plurox SMB plugin NetServerEnum, right: Trickster WormDll NetServerEnum_\n\nAs can be seen in these samples, not only is the injected code similar, but also the code for\nstandard procedures. Based on this, we can assume that the analyzed samples were taken\nfrom the same source code (commented lines in the Trickster plugin are missing in the\nPlurox plugin), which means the respective creators of Plurox and Trickster may be linked.\n\nKaspersky security solutions detect the bot and its plugins with the verdicts\n**Backdoor.Win32.Plurox and HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic.**\n\n## IoC\n\n**C&C servers**\n\n178.21[.]11.90\n185.146[.]157.143\n37.140[.]199.65\n194.58[.]92.63\nobuhov2k[.]beget[.]tech\nwebdynamicname[.]com\n37.46[.]131.250\n188.93[.]210.42\n\n## MD5\n\n**Main body**\n59523DD8F5CE128B68EA44ED2EDD5FCA\nC4A74D79030336A0C3CF60DE2CFAE9E9\nCECFD6BCFDD56B5CC1C129740EA2C524\nBE591AA0E48E496B781004D0E833E261\n\n\n-----\n\n**Trickster Worm module**\nf233dd609821c896a4cb342cf0afe7b2\n**auto_proc32**\n2e55ae88c67b1d871049af022cc22aac\n**auto_proc64**\nb2d76d715a81862db84f216112fb6930\n**auto_opencl_amd32**\na24fd434ffc7d3157272189753118fbf\n**auto_opencl_amd64**\n117f978f07a658bce0b5751617e9d465\n**auto_miner32**\n768857d6792ee7be1e1c5b60636501e5\n**auto_miner64**\ne8aed94c43c8c6f8218e0f2e9b57f083\n**upnp32**\n8cf5c72217c1bb48902da2c83c9ccd4e\n**upnp64**\nb2824d2007c5a1077856ae6d8192f523\n**smb32**\n6915dd5186c65891503f90e91d8716c6\n**smb64**\ncd68adc0fbd78117521b7995570333b2\n\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[EternalBlue](https://securelist.com/tag/eternalblue/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Miner](https://securelist.com/tag/miner/)\n[Vulnerabilities and exploits](https://securelist.com/tag/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Anton Kuzmenko](https://securelist.com/author/antonkuzmenko/)\n\nPlurox: Modular backdoor\n\nYour email address will not be published.
