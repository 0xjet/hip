Webhards are platforms commonly used for the distribution of malware in Korea,\nwhere njRAT and UDP Rat were distributed in the past.\n\n[UDP RAT Malware Being Distributed via Webhards](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/27555/)\n\nThe cases that are recently being discovered are similar to the case discussed in the post\nabove, and it appears that the same attacker is continuing to distribute the malware. For\nstarters, the malware is being distributed under the guise of adult games. Additionally, the\nDDoS malware was installed via downloader and UDP Rat was used.\n\nOne difference is that the previous downloader malware was developed using C#, but now\nGoLang is used instead. The publicly released open-source Simple-IRC-Botnet (DDoS IRC\nBot malware developed with GoLang) was also used along with UDP Rat.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Open-source Simple-IRC-Botnet\nThe GoLang is used by various attackers and its usage is increasing recently due to various\nstrengths it has: its low development difficulties and its cross-platform support. Following\nsuch a trend, cases that use GoLang are increasing in Korat malware strains that target\nKorean users.\n\nAs shown in the figure below, malware disguised as an adult game is uploaded to the\nwebhard.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Compressed file that contains malware distributed on the webhard\nWhile it is uncertain whether the person who uploaded this game is the attacker, similar\nposts are distributing the same malware using compressed files. Note that the games differ\nbut the malware inside the compressed files is the same as what will be discussed below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Other posts uploaded by the attacker\nThe adult games used for attacks contain the following path name. This means that they\nwere distributed through the compressed files with the following names.\n\n– [19 Korean version] Naughty Mage’s EXXXXX Life\n\n– [19 Korean version] The Reason She Became a Slave\n\n– [19 Korean version] Refraining of Heavenly Walk\n\n– [19 Korean version] Exchange Diary of Violation\n\n– [19 Korean version] Girl From Tea Ceremony Club\n\n– [19 Korean version] Curse of Lilia\n\n– [19 Korean version] Academy with Magical Girls\n\n– [19 Korean version] Monster Fight\n– [19 Korean version] Dreamy Lilium\n\n– [19 Korean version] Enraged Department Manager\n\n– [19 Korean version] Fancy Days of Sayuri\n\n– [19 Korean version] Sleif Corporation\n\n– [19 Korean version] Country Girl Exposure\n\n– [19 Korean version] Sylvia and Master of Medicine\n\n– [19 Korean version] Assassin Asca\n\n– [19 Korean version] How to Reform Your Girlfriend\n\n– [19 Korean version] Creating Utopia with Subjugation Skill\n– [19 Korean version] Uriel and Belial\n\n– [19 Korean version] The Case of Chairperson Kana\n\n– [19 Korean version] Princess Round\n\n– [19 Korean version] Flora and the Root of the World Tree\n\n\n-----\n\n– [19 Korean version] Midnight Exposure\n– [19 Korean version] Modern Day Elf\n– [19 Korean version] Research Data of Homunculus\n\nUpon decompressing the downloaded zip file, the following files appear. Normally, users\nwould run the “Game_Open.exe” file shown below to play the game.\n\nFigure 4. Malware disguised as Game_Open.exe file\nBut “Game_Open.exe” is not a launcher that runs the game. It is an executable that runs the\nadditional malware. To be more precise, it changes the “PN” file existing in the same path as\n“scall.dll” and runs it. Then it copies the original game executable “index” to “Game.exe” to\nrun it. As such, users would assume that the game is being run normally.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Actual game program run by malware\nOnce the process above is complete, the “Game_Open.exe” file becomes hidden. After\nhidden, users would run “Game.exe” which is a copy of game program launcher. Note that\n“PN” file that was changed to “scall.exe” and executed is malware. It first moves “srt” file\nexisting in the same path to C:\\Program Files\\EdmGen.exe.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Malware created in Program Files path\nIt then registers “EdmGen.exe” to the task scheduler using the following command to have it\nrun periodically.\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe” /c SCHTASKS /CREATE /SC ONSTART /NP /TN\n“Windows Google” /TR “C:\\Program Files\\EdmGen.exe”\n\n“EdmGen.exe” (“srt” file) that is executed by the process shown above runs the normal\nprogram vbc.exe and injects malware into the program. The malware that is injected to\nvbc.exe and executed is also a downloader type discussed in the previous ASEC blog post.\nOne difference is that it was developed with GoLang instead of C#.\n\nThe malware can periodically access the C&C server as shown below to obtain the URL of\nmalware that will be downloaded to install additional malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Routine of injected Golang downloader\n\nDownload URL for Additional Malware: hxxp://node.kibot[.]pw:8880/links/01-13\nCreation Path of Downloaded Malware: C:\\Down\\discord_[random characters]\\\n\n[malware name]\n\nPreviously, the type of additionally installed malware was UDP Rat DDoS. Yet for this case,\nthere was also Simple-IRC-Botnet developed with GoLang.\n\nIt is also a type of DDoS Bot malware, but it uses IRC protocols to communicate with the\nC&C server. Unlike UDP Rat that only supported UDP Flooding attacks, it can also support\nattacks such as Slowris, Goldeneye, and Hulk DDoS.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Routine function of Golang DDoS\n\nIRC Bot malware\nGolang DDoS IRC Bot connects to a particular IRC server when it is run and enters the\nattacker’s channel. It can perform DDoS attacks on a target if the attacker sends commands\nfrom the channel.\n\n**– IRC Server List Used by Golang DDoS IRC Bot Malware**\n210.121.222[.]32:6667\n157.230.106[.]25:6667\n89.108.116[.]192:6667\n176.56.239[.]136:6697\n\nFigure 9.

DDoS\n\ncommands that can be sent by the attacker through IRC channel\nAs shown in the examples above, the malware is being distributed actively via file sharing\nwebsites such as Korean webhards. As such, caution is advised when approaching\nexecutables downloaded from a file-sharing website. It is recommend for the users to\ndownload products from the official websites of developers.\n\n**[File Detection]**\nTrojan/Win.Korat.C4914970 (2022.01.16.00)\nTrojan/Win.Korat.R465157 (2022.01.16.00)\nTrojan/Win.Korat.C4914985 (2022.01.16.00)\nDownloader/Win.Korat.C4914968 (2022.01.16.00)\nDownloader/Win.Korat.C4914972 (2022.01.16.00)\nDownloader/Win.Korat.C4914976 (2022.01.16.00)\nDownloader/Win.Korat.C4914977 (2022.01.16.00)\nDownloader/Win.Korat.C4914979 (2022.01.16.00)\nDownloader/Win.Korat.C4914980 (2022.01.16.00)\nDownloader/Win.Korat.C4914997 (2022.01.16.00)\nTrojan/Win.IRCGo.C4915003 (2022.01.16.00)\nTrojan/Win.IRCGo.C4915004 (2022.01.16.00)\nTrojan/Win.IRCGo.C4915005 (2022.01.16.00)\nBackdoor/Win.UDPRat.R465188 (2022.01.16.00)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[IOC]**\n**File**\n**– Game Launcher**\naffbad0bedccbf1812599fbce847d917\nb21ad73be72280ae30d8c5556824409e\n889289d9d97f7c31925a451700b4b7ac\n2a7de90437c66b3f2304630c3324e2de\nf14c51ca5d7afc1128cceca5d5a5694b\n41320f572cdf14abc1401a72a24a621d\nd38803b3f7c0faac71a3e572e9214891\n5d97a32e47dfa54dd1bebde208252b88\n12baeacfd0ac2d66c5959d6305a4fe50\n\n**– Launcher**\nb621005a147ef842fbc7198c8431724c\nba43e4c84da7600881ed5ccac070e001\nb6ad8550dcd317a49c6e563a1188d9f0\ndb2db486b828182c827e4fdfc292e143\n4c1777b5763bc7655d1ca89ae4774470\n2357c1c6027f21094fa62a35300a96ae\n28566a08334f37d7a8d244c393e9ad33\n4b3eff9f394ebd2231c5c0b980c62e63\n74834f29dd5d244742879c2d800e8a53\n4b3eff9f394ebd2231c5c0b980c62e63\n\n**– Downloader**\n42a344fbad7a56e76c83013c677330ac\n6b029fc7a0f480b7dd6158bba680e49b\n5a74ea453f0b424770fdddaf470f5eae\n12c97b2481efe448b93b72b80eb96563\n1f993f08ed40f6b03db7f78ab8e087a5\n005247fa9b312eb449150b52b38e0a4c\n1f2147b2a0caeb43a9a3bcaf42808581\n63ff6d1bb53cdd2d7b7fca856826c8b6\n\n**– UDP Rat**\nbff341b0c95eda801429a4b5c321f464\n0fd264b12ea39e39da7807a117718429\naf486a4e9fdc62ac31f8424a787a460c\n2160629e9def4c9482b4fb642c0cd2d8\n51cfd6c6390ce99979350a9a21471d30\n194fb8590e1218f911870c54b5830f16\n7b73a4e6e504800e256495861d0c9f78\n\n\n-----\n\n57568755bac3f20fffb970a3c6386a43\n55b6e07ff120b6c2e784c8900333aa76\nbc18d787c4d886f24fa673bd2056e1ed\n5be1ab1d5385d5aeadc3b498d5476761\n1bc93ee0bd931d60d3cd636aa35176e3\na2fc31b9c6a23e0a5acc591e46c61618\n977c52d51d44a0a9257017b72cfafab1\n98e4f982363c70bd9e52e5a249fce662\n\n**– Golang DDoS IRC Bot**\n7f3bd23af53c52b3e84255d7a3232111\n00b9bf730dd99f43289eac1c67578852\n90bfa487e9c5e8fe58263e09214e565b\n2fe8262d0034349a030200390b23b453\n8053b24878c4243d8eda0ccae8905ccb\n\n**C&C Server**\n**– Downloader Malware**\nhxxp://organic.kibot[.]pw:2095/links/12-20\nhxxp://node.kibot[.]pw:2095/links/12-20\nhxxp://node.kibot[.]pw:2095/links/12-25\nhxxp://node.kibot[.]pw:8880/links/12-28\nhxxp://miix.kibot[.]pw:8880/links/12-28\nhxxp://node.kibot[.]pw:8880/links/12-28\nhxxp://node.kibot[.]pw:8880/links/01-13\n\n**– UDP Rat**\n195.133.18[.]27:1234\n195.133.18[.]27:8080\n195.133.18[.]27:9997\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\nTAGGED AS:DDOS, GO, GOLANG, IRC, UDPRAT, WEBHARD\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information/)\n\n[Tagged as:DDOS,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/ddos-en/) [Go,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/go/) [Golang,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/golang/) [IRC,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/irc/) [udprat,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/udprat/) [webhard](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/webhard-en/)\n\n\n-----",
