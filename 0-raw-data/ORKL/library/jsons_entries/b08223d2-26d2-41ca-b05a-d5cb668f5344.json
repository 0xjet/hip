    "plain_text": "# The cybercriminal underground hasn’t forgotten about financial services\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/financial-cybercrime-2021-jackpotting-atm-malware](https://intel471.com/blog/financial-cybercrime-2021-jackpotting-atm-malware)**\n\nIt is a well-worn cliche in cybersecurity: criminals prey on banks and financial services\nbecause that’s where the money is. In 2021, that remains a fact. However, while the overall\ncrime remains the same, who is responsible for it and the method by which the crimes are\ncarried out have been modified.\n\nWhile the financial services sector has undoubtedly increased security procedures and\nadopted advanced technologies to deter attacks, underground actors continue to adapt and\ndevelop new methods of evading anti-fraud systems to gain access to sensitive information\nthat financial businesses and organizations collect, store and transmit. With the world having\nto adjust to the global pandemic in 2020, financial services are now exposed to new risks and\nthreats that attackers are taking advantage of. In the past six months, Intel 471 has observed\nactors on the cybercriminal underground establish their reputation using a variety of goods,\nproducts and services that have specifically targeted financial services.\n\n## One door closes, two doors open\n\nThere have been significant actions taken to undercut cybercrime this year, with each event\nweakening criminals’ ability to target financial services. One was Joker's Stash, the prolific\ncarding dump shop, which announced its closure in January 2021. That announcement came\n[after law enforcement allegedly seized proxy servers used in connection with the site’s](https://intel471.com/blog/jokers-stash-fbi-interpol-dns-takedown-temporary/)\nblockchain-based domains. Another law enforcement action in 2021 successfully disrupted\nthe Emotet botnet, which featured a modular loader that could steal credentials and bank\ndetails from infected users, as well as distribute other malware.\n\nWhile each of these takedowns kneecaps criminal activity, there are actors on the\nunderground who move to fill in the void left by the law enforcement actions. With each of\nthe above examples, Intel 471 has seen other actors quickly move to establish a bigger\npresence in the market.\n\nWith regards to Joker’s Stash, we have observed the creation of and updates to numerous\npayment card data shops. An updated shop Intel 471 has been tracking offered payment card\ninformation, particularly card verification values (CVVs) and dumps that included the data\ncopied from payment card magnetic stripes. As of mid-December 2020, the shop allegedly\ncontained 1,200 compromised payment card records and about 21,000 dumps for sale.\n\nWith regards to malware-as-a-service, Intel 471 has seen two actors sell access to malware\nthat targets the Android operating system in an effort to pull bank credentials. One service,\nfirst advertised in October 2020, includes the ability to intercept, send and receive text\n\n\n-----\n\nmessages; grab payment card data and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes; and steal\nonline banking payment details through web-injects. Another actor, a relative newcomer to\nthe cybercriminal underground, started advertising an Android-focused MaaS that could\nintercept, send and receive text messages; record an infected device’s screen; grab payment\ncard data; and steal online banking credentials through web-injects. The service allegedly\nalso supported a socket secure internet protocol (SOCKS5) proxy and keylogging modules.\n\n## Access is everything\n\nWithout obtaining credentials, a cybercriminal’s attempt to steal money or sensitive\ninformation is exceedingly difficult. Credentials are a crucial cog for actors, serving as the\ntool that paves the path to ill-gotten gains. Financial institutions are already a heavily\ntargeted sector, so this threat has the capability to impact those at both an individual and\norganizational level.\n\nIntel 471 has observed a number of actors advertise possession of personal bank account\nlogin credentials, an organization's employee credentials, as well as system access credentials\nover the past few months. In the closing months of 2020, we observed one actor offering\nbank logins with credit card information from a Spanish financial institution, while also\nclaiming to have bank logins available from a French bank and an online bank popular in\nEurope. Additionally, another actor being tracked by Intel 471 offered to sell compromised\naccount credentials to the control panel of business process management software used by an\nundisclosed insurance company.\n\nOn the network access side, one actor Intel 471 is tracking tried to sell unauthorized access to\nan undisclosed bank in Africa, claiming to have administrator-level access to the\norganization’s domain controller, access credentials to some databases, the source code of\nundisclosed applications the organization used, and the bank’s customer data. As recently as\nJanuary 2021, another actor monitored by Intel 471 offered to sell unauthorized access to the\nnetwork of a France-based company that deals in hardware and software for PoS systems,\nincluding automatic coin mechanisms, cash registers, management systems and payment\nsoftware. The compromised account allegedly included domain administrator privileges and\nenabled access to the company’s product source codes, GitHub software development\nplatform accounts, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts, employee email accounts and lists\nof customer email addresses.\n\nWhile an organization can help individuals recover from compromised payment cards or\nbank logins, bouncing back from network compromise is much more difficult and therefore\npresents a much larger threat.\n\n## Criminals make money machine go BRRR\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen not going after the users or company itself, cybercriminals have turned their attention\nto the next best thing: the machines that hold the money. The act of using malware to force\nATMs to malfunction and empty their cash — known as “jackpotting” — has been around for\nsome time, but actors are finding novel ways to get around baked-in defenses. Intel 471\nobserved one actor selling ATM malware that allegedly could be deployed using a speciallycrafted Raspberry Pi kit computer and be controlled remotely via a smartphone or a laptop.\n\nATMs aren’t the only hardware in criminals’ sights. Point-of-sale (PoS) malware also is being\nsold on underground markets, taking advantage of flaws in the devices used to process card\npayments at retail locations to steal sensitive information. Intel 471 observed an actor in\nFebruary 2021 selling PoS malware dubbed “ATM & POS Malware Injector” that allegedly\noperated as a data sniffer without requiring additional action from the user. The malware\nfeatures included payment transaction data output in a result box that included Track 1 and\nTrack 2 data, as well as the personal identification number (PIN) code for the compromised\npayment card. Data collected via this kind of malware has the capability to be used in further\nfraudulent activity or offered for sale as a product on underground forums or via dump shop\nservices.\n\nWhile the global economy took a hit over the last year as it recovers from the pandemic, the\nunderground marketplace continues to flourish with new opportunities as the potential\nvictim pool grows with the increase of people using online services. The buying, selling and\ntrading of products, goods and services used for crimes has fueled several attack schemes,\nwith many developed specifically to target the financial services sector. It’s apparent that\nseveral threat actors leveraged multiple products, goods and services together to maximize\npotential impact and profit. The target on financial services has remained a large one, with\nnew actors constantly developing ways to pry money away from its rightful owners.\n\n\n-----",
