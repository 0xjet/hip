Using RATs, attackers can perform various tasks such as accessing files, cameras, and\nother resources remotely while conducting keylogging, system operations, etc.\n\n[A developer named “Arsium” posted a new version of this open-source RAT – EagleMonitorRAT – on](https://github.com/arsium/EagleMonitorRAT)\nGitHub. Additionally, the developer posted a link to the GitHub page of the EagleMonitorRAT to various\nunderground dark web markets. Figure 1 shows one such post by the developer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – Post by EagleMonitorRAT Developer\nAccording to the developer, the EagleMonitorRAT is written in C# and upgraded from HorusEyesRat,\nwhich is Visual Basic .NET-based.\n\nCyble Research Labs has analyzed the RAT binary and panel to gain insights into the functionalities and\nimpact of the RAT.\n\n## RAT Details\n\nWhile building the solution, various executables and support plugins are compiled, including client\nbuilder plugins and an admin panel. Figure 2 shows the compiled binaries and other files.\n\nFigure 2 – Compiled Binaries for EagleMonitorRAT\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, various Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files are also compiled to support operations such as file\nmanagement, keylogging, etc. Figure 3 shows the support DLL files.\n\nFigure 3 – List of DLL Files after compilation\n\nA client builder is used to compile the binary, which will be delivered to users to compromise a target\nmachine. The client binary may be delivered to users using various initial infection vectors such as spam\nemail etc. The builder has an option to specify the IP address of the server, port, and key. Figure 4\nshows the client builder.\n\nFigure 4 – EagleMonitorRAT Client Builder Panel\n\n\n-----\n\nEagleMonitorRAT has a server panel for managing victim devices. The panel shows country, hardware\nID, operating system details, username, available RAM, privilege, region etc. Additionally, the panel has\nvarious options to manage as well for performing several operations in the infected device.\n\nThe Admin panel of EagleMonitorRAT includes operations such as:\n\nrecovery\ndesktop\nmiscellaneous panels\nmass tasks\nmemory execution\ninformation\nclient\n\nFigure 5 shows the administration panel of EagleMonitorRAT.\n\nFigure 5 – Administration Panel of EagleMonitorRAT\nIn the recovery option of EagleMonitorRAT, there are three different options – passwords, history, and\nautofill.\n\nThe Recovery option works as an information stealer which extracts usernames, passwords, and\nbrowser history. Figure 6 shows stolen information retrieved using the Recovery menu from the victim’s\nmachine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – Recovery Data extracted from the Recovery Option\nThe Desktop menu option of EagleMonitorRAT has 5 different suboperations – file manager, process\nmanager, live keylogger, remote desktop, and remote webcam. Refer to Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7 – Desktop Option of EagleMonitorRAT\nThe File Manager menu option of EagleMonitorRAT gives TAs the functionality to manage files in the\nspecific directory of the infected device, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 – File Manager Option of the RAT\nThe Process Manager menu options show the details of the running process of the infected device, such\nas Icon, ID, Name, Window Title, Window Handle, and Is64Bit. Figure 9 shows the Process Manager.\n\nFigure 9 – Process Manager of the EagleMonitorRAT\nThe shellcode injection menu option of the EagleMonitorRAT gives attackers an option to perform\nshellcode injection remotely in the infected device. Refer to Figure 10.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10 – Remote Shellcode Injection Option\nThe EagleMonitorRAT has a live keylogger functionality to remotely capture the victim system’s\nkeystrokes. Figure 11 shows the keylogger menu operation of the RAT.\n\nFigure 11 – Live Keylogger\nThe Remote Desktop functionality captures screenshots of the victim system remotely at predefined\nintervals. Figure 12 shows the captured screen.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12 – Screenshot Captured by the EagleMonitorRAT\nThis RAT has a menu option to remotely capture the webcam feed of the infected system as well. Figure\n13 shows the webcam panel.\n\nFigure 13 – Webcam Panel of the EagleMonitorRAT\n\n\n-----\n\nThe EagleMonitorRAT has miscellaneous menu options to perform other remote operations such as\nhiding the taskbar, changing wallpapers, sound management, etc., as shown below.\n\nFigure 14 –\n\nMiscellaneous Options of EagleMonitorRAT\nEagleMonitorRAT also has a menu option to discover the network connection and get the CPU\ninformation of the infected system. Figure 15 shows the network connection and CPU information.\n\nFigure 15 – Network connection and CPU Monitoring\nThe RAT panel has a menu option to remotely shutdown, reboot, log out, BSOD, lock the workstation,\nhibernate and suspend the victim’s system. Figure 16 showcases these options.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16 – Remote Client\n\nManagement Option\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRATs have steadily become stealthier and more efficient with new techniques in place. Various\ncybercriminals and Advanced Persistent Threat Groups have leveraged RATs in the past.\n\nCyble has observed data breaches in high-profile organizations due to such threats. Since EagleMonitor\nis an open-source RAT, it is possible that threat actors could create and deploy custom variations for\nfuture attacks. Organizations and individuals should thus continue to follow industry best cybersecurity\npractices.\n\n## Our Recommendations:\n\nUse strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected\ndevices.\n\nUse a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,\nincluding PC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their\nauthenticity.\nEducate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted URLs.\nBlock URLs that could be used to spread the malware, e.g., Torrent/Warez.\nMonitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.\n\n\n-----\n\nEnable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solutions on the employees systems.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK® Techniques \n\n**Tactic** **Technique ID** **Technique Name**\n\n**Execution** [T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) User Execution\n\n\n**Privilege Escalation** [T1543](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/)\n\n[T1055](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)\n\n**Credential Access** [T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/)\n\n[T1539](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539/)\n\n[T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/)\n\n[T1528](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528/)\n\n**Collection** [T1113](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/)\n\n[T1123](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1123/)\n\n[T1119](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/)\n\n[T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\n\n[T1056](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/)\n\n**Discovery** [T1518](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/)\n\n[T1124](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1124/)\n\n[T1007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007/)\n\n[T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\n\n[T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046/)\n\n\nCreate or Modify System Process\n\nProcess Injection\n\nCredentials from Password Stores\n\nSteal Web Session Cookie\n\nUnsecured Credentials\n\nSteal Application Access Token\n\nScreen Capture\n\nAudio Capture\n\nAutomated Collection\n\nData from Local System\n\nInput Capture\n\nSoftware Discovery\n\nSystem Time Discovery\n\nSystem Service Discovery\n\nFile and Directory Discovery\n\nNetwork Service Scanning\n\n\n**Command and Control** [T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/) Application Layer Protocol\n\n**Exfiltration** [T1041](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/) Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): \n\n**Indicators** **Indicator**\n**type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n**Eagle**\n**Monitor**\n**RAT Reborn**\n**(x32).exe**\n\n**Eagle**\n**Monitor**\n**Builder.exe**\n\n**Client.exe**\n\n\n6c172f7329eb3d18eb59de21aa065ee4\n12b61e975fa830fee6ea04e66cb07b5db6c4477b\nb1422ef3148f49247b207d4c167cc54c6d3c65d408910470b252ea178eaa66c8\n\n6d269bc0b0a986e6e437bc9a33c6c95a\n47e45dd7e64fe23dd9cb88a3545cee7b9014239c\n8cc10fff94267bd402ef92cf0e886120803a3d46f90e821bc28fe0f5b2606082\n\nc179251bae0044413c32b224895bf103\nb6d646d9ae87eefc4dc271f3e0419f43bdb2c94f\n7b09df73e2551317e2547391361b579899cfcfd3304aab7fe4808858822be3f4\n\n\n**Md5**\n**SHA-1**\n**SHA-**\n**256**\n\n**Md5**\n**SHA-1**\n**SHA-**\n**256**\n\n**Md5**\n**SHA-1**\n**SHA-**\n**256**\n\n\n-----",
