Instead of typing them, users tend to copy and paste the addresses\nusing the clipboard. A type of malware, known as a “clipper”, takes advantage of this. It\nintercepts the content of the clipboard and replaces it surreptitiously with what the attacker\nwants to subvert. In the case of a cryptocurrency transaction, the affected user might end\nup with the copied wallet address quietly switched to one belonging to the attacker.\n\nThis dangerous form of malware first made its rounds in 2017 on the Windows platform and\nwas spotted in shady Android app stores in the summer of 2018. In February 2019, we\ndiscovered a malicious clipper on Google Play, the official Android app store.\n\nAlthough relatively new, cryptocurrency stealers that rely on altering the clipboard’s content\n[can be considered established malware. ESET researchers even discovered one hosted on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/03/14/stealing-bitcoin-download-com/)\ndownload.cnet.com, one of the most popular software-hosting sites in the world. In August\n[2018, the first Android clipper was discovered being sold on underground hacking forums](https://news.drweb.com/show?lng=en&i=12739)\nand since then, this malware has been detected in several shady app stores.\n\n## Copy&Steal\n\nThe clipper we found lurking in the Google Play store, detected by ESET security solutions\n[as Android/Clipper.C, impersonates a legitimate service called MetaMask. The malware’s](https://metamask.io/)\nprimary purpose is to steal the victim’s credentials and private keys to gain control over the\nvictim’s Ethereum funds. However, it can also replace a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet address\ncopied to the clipboard with one belonging to the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Android/Clipper.C impersonating MetaMask on Google Play\n\nWe spotted Android/Clipper.C shortly after it had been introduced at the official Android\nstore, which was on February 1, 2019. We reported the discovery to the Google Play\nsecurity team, who removed the app from the Store.\n\nThis attack targets users who want to use the mobile version of the MetaMask service,\n[which is designed to run Ethereum decentralized apps in a browser, without having to run a](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp)\nfull Ethereum node. However, the service currently does not offer a mobile app – only addons for desktop browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.\n\nSeveral malicious apps have been caught previously on Google Play impersonating\nMetaMask. However, they merely phished for sensitive information with the goal of\naccessing the victims’ cryptocurrency funds.\n\n## Security tips\n\n\n-----\n\nThis first appearance of clipper malware on Google Play serves as another imperative for\nAndroid users to stick with the best practices for mobile security.\n\nTo stay safe from clippers and other Android malware, we advise you to:\n\nKeep your Android device updated and use a reliable mobile security solution\nStick to the official Google Play store when downloading apps…\n…however, always check the official website of the app developer or service provider\nfor the link to the official app. If there is not one, consider it a red flag and be\nextremely cautious to any result of your Google Play search\nDouble-check every step in all transactions that involve anything valuable, from\nsensitive information to money. When using the clipboard, always check if what you\npasted is what you intended to enter.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Package Name** **Hash**\n\ncom.lemon.metamask 24D7783AAF34884677A601D487473F88\n\nBTC address: 17M66AG2uQ5YZLFEMKGpzbzh4F1EsFWkmA\n\nETH address: 0xfbbb2EF692B5101f16d3632f836461904C761965\n\n8 Feb 2019 - 11:58AM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
