Like the Angler case study mentioned above, this\nsuccess points to the value of industry collaboration to\ncombat attackers.\n\n- Malicious browser extensions can be a major source\nof data leakage for businesses and are a widespread\nproblem. We estimate that more than 85 percent of\norganizations studied are affected by malicious\nbrowser extensions.\n\n- Well-known botnets like Bedep, Gamarue, and Miuref\nrepresented the majority of botnet command-andcontrol activity affecting one group of organizations\nwe analyzed in July 2015.\n\n\n\n- Cisco’s analysis of malware validated as “known bad”\nfound that the majority of that malware—91.3 percent—\nuses the Domain Name Service (DNS) to carry out\ncampaigns. Through retrospective investigation into\nDNS queries, Cisco uncovered “rogue” DNS resolvers\nin use on customer networks. The customers were\nnot aware that the resolvers were being used by their\nemployees as part of their DNS infrastructure.\n\n- Adobe Flash vulnerabilities continue to be popular\nwith cybercriminals. However, software vendors\nare reducing the risk that users will be exposed to\nmalware through Flash technology.\n\n- Observing the trends in 2015, our researchers suggest\nthat HTTPS-encrypted traffic has reached a tipping\npoint: it will soon become the dominant form of\nInternet traffic. Although encryption can help protect\nconsumers, it also can undermine the effectiveness\nof security products, making it more difficult for the\nsecurity community to track threats. Adding to the\nchallenge, some malware may initiate encrypted\ncommunications across a diverse set of ports.\n\n- Bad actors are making use of compromised websites\ncreated by the popular web development platform\nWordPress for their criminal activities. There, they can\nmarshal server resources and evade detection.\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report Major Developments and Discoveries\n\n        - Aging infrastructure is growing and leaves        - The benchmark study shows that small and midsize\norganizations increasingly vulnerable to compromise. businesses (SMBs) use fewer defenses than larger\nWe analyzed 115,000 Cisco devices on the Internet enterprises.

They tried to avoid detection by making\nonly brief incursions into enterprise networks to launch\ntheir exploits. Today, some emboldened cybercriminals are\ntapping into legitimate online resources. They leach server\ncapacity, steal data, and demand ransoms from online\nvictims whose information they hold hostage.\n\nThese campaigns are a sobering escalation in the war\nbetween defenders and attackers. If adversaries find more\nplaces online from which to operate, then their impact can\ngrow exponentially.\n\n\nThe explosion in ransomware (see page 10) is a prime\nexample. Ransomware provides criminals with an easy\nway to extract more money directly from users. When\nadversaries establish campaigns that compromise tens of\nthousands of users per day with little or no interruption, the\n“paycheck” for their efforts can be staggering. In addition\nto developing better ways to monetize their campaigns,\nattackers are encroaching on legitimate resources as\nstaging grounds.\n\nCreators of some ransomware variants as well as\ndevelopers of other exploits are now shifting traffic to\nhacked WordPress websites as a way to avoid detection\nand use server space (see page 33).

Our ongoing research and analysis of discovered threats, such as malware traffic, can provide insights on possible future criminal behavior and aid in the detection of threats.\n\n Featured Stories\n\n Industry Collaboration Helps Cisco Sideline Far-Reaching and\n Highly Profitable Exploit Kit and Ransomware Campaign\n\n\nThe Angler exploit kit is one of the largest and most\neffective exploit kits on the market. It has been linked to\nseveral high-profile malvertising (malicious advertising) and\nransomware campaigns. And it has been a major factor\nin the overall explosion of ransomware activity that our\nthreat researchers have been monitoring closely for the\npast several years. Miscreants use ransomware to encrypt\nusers’ files, providing the keys for decryption only after\nusers pay a “ransom”—usually in the $300 to $500 range.\n\nAs reported in the Cisco 2015 Midyear Security Report,\ncryptocurrencies like bitcoin and anonymization networks\nsuch as Tor make it easy for adversaries to enter the\nmalware market and quickly begin generating revenue.\nRansomware’s rise in popularity can be tied to two main\nadvantages: It is a low-maintenance operation for threat\nactors, and it offers a quick path to monetization because\nthe users pay adversaries directly in cryptocurrencies.\n\n\nIn this case, the IP infrastructure supporting Angler was\nnot large. The daily number of active systems generally\nhovered between 8 and 12. Most were active for only one\nday. Figure 1 shows the number of unique IP addresses\nthat Cisco observed throughout July 2015.\n\nCisco found that Angler operators were essentially\nrolling through IP addresses in a linear fashion to conceal\nthe threat activity and to prevent any interruption to\ntheir moneymaking.\n\n###### Figure 1.

As the system compromises users\nand generates “noise” that defenders begin to detect, the\nadversaries shift to an adjacent IP address (74.63.217.219).\nThis activity continues through near-contiguous blocks of IP\nspace from a single hosting provider.\n\nCisco examined the IP information to identify the autonomous\nsystem numbers (ASNs) and the providers associated with the\nIP addresses. We determined that most of the Angler-related\ntraffic was coming from servers operated by two legitimate\nhosting providers: Limestone Networks and Hetzner\n(Figure 3). They accounted for almost 75 percent of the\noverall volume of traffic for the month of July.\n\nCisco reached out first to Limestone Networks, which\nappeared to be hosting the largest global portion of\nAngler. Limestone embraced the opportunity to collaborate.\nThe company had been dealing with excessive credit card\nchargebacks every month because adversaries were using\nfraudulent names and credit cards to buy random batches\n\nof their servers worth thousands of dollars.\n\n###### SHARE\n\n Figure 3.

For example, a miscreant might buy three or four\nservers on one day, and then use a different name and\ncredit card to purchase three or four servers the next day.\nIn this way, they could essentially “roll” from one IP address\nto the next when compromised servers were identified and\ntaken offline by defenders.\n\nTo investigate this activity, Cisco enlisted help from\nLevel 3 Threat Research Labs as well as from OpenDNS,\na Cisco company. Level 3 Threat Research Labs was able\nto provide greater global insight into the threat, giving\nCisco the ability to see a little deeper into the scope of\nthe threat and how far-reaching it was at its peak. OpenDNS,\nmeanwhile, provided a unique look at the domain activity\nassociated with the threat, giving Cisco a more complete\nunderstanding of how techniques like domain shadowing\nwere being incorporated by the adversaries.\n\nCisco threat researchers then looked into how, specifically,\nusers were encountering Angler and subsequently being\nserved malicious payloads. The researchers observed\npopular websites redirecting users to the Angler exploit kit\nthrough malvertising. The false ads were placed on hundreds\nof major news, real estate, and popular culture sites. These\ntypes of sites are commonly referred to in the security\ncommunity as “known good” sites.\n\n\nand were removed after a handful of users were targeted.\nIn our July 2015 analysis, we noted that the peaks in activity\ncoincided with the various Hacking Team zero-day exploits\n\n(CVE-2015-5119, CVE-2015-5122).[1]\n\n\n###### Figure 4. Unique Referers by Day, July 2015\n\nPeak activities coincided with zero-day exploits\n\n0\n\n\n1 15 31\n\n**July 2015**\n\n\nAdditionally, Cisco threat researchers found countless\nexamples of small, seemingly random websites doing\nthe same type of redirection, including a single person’s\nobituary from a small, rural newspaper in the United States.\nMore than likely, the latter strategy was designed to target\nelderly people. This population is generally more likely to use\ndefault web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and\nare less likely to be aware of the need to regularly patch\nAdobe Flash vulnerabilities.\n\nAnother notable aspect of this Angler operation was the\nvolume of unique referers and the low frequency with which\nthey were used (Figure 4). We found more than 15,000\nunique sites pushing people to the Angler exploit kit,\n99.8 percent of which were used fewer than 10 times. Most\nof the referers were therefore active only for a short period\n\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\nCisco determined that about 60 percent of the Angler\npayloads delivered through this particular operation were\ndelivering some type of ransomware variant, the majority\nbeing Cryptowall 3.0. Other types of payloads included\nBedep, a malware downloader that is commonly used\nto install click-fraud campaign malware. (See “Browser\nInfections: Widespread—and a Major Source of Data\nLeakage,” page 16.) Both types of malware are designed to\nhelp adversaries make a lot of money from compromised\nusers very quickly, and with little or no effort.\n\n\n¹ “Adobe Patches Hacking Team’s Flash Player Zero-Day,” by Eduard Kovacs, SecurityWeek, July 8, 2015:\n\n**[http://www.securityweek.com/adobe-patches-hacking-teams-flash-player-zero-day.](http://www.securityweek.com/adobe-patches-hacking-teams-flash-player-zero-day)**\n\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report Threat Intelligence\n\n Angler Revenue\n\n\n###### 147\n\nredirection\nservers\nper month\n\n\n###### 40\n\ncompromised\n\n\n###### %\n 90Ktargets 62\n\ndelivered\n\nper server\n\nransomware\n\nper day\n\n### X\n\n###### 10% 2.9%\n\nserved exploits of ransoms paid\n\n\n###### $300\n\n\n###### $34M\n\ngross yearly income\nfor ransomware\n\n# =\n\nper campaign\n\n\n###### 300\n\naverage ransom\n\n\n9515 users are paying ransoms per month\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\nAccording to Cisco’s research, the primary actor\nresponsible for about half of the Angler exploit kit activity in\nthis particular campaign was targeting up to 90,000 victims\nper day.

Because it enlists tens of thousands of\nmachines distributed across the Internet, it has the power\nto launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack\nthat cannot be addressed on a device-by-device basis. In\nthis case, the botnet was being created using brute-force\nattacks involving secure shell (SSH) traffic (Figure 6).\nThe SSH protocol is used to allow secure communications,\nand it is commonly used for the remote administration of\nsystems. At times, SSHPsychos accounted for more than\n35 percent of all global Internet SSH traffic (Figure 7),\naccording to analysis by Cisco and Level 3.\n\n###### Figure 6.

It\nwas essential to work in tandem with an organization that\ncould remove the brute-forcing group from the Internet\neffectively. However, backbone providers are hesitant to\nfilter their customers’ content.\n\nCisco reached out to Level 3 Threat Research Labs.\nLevel 3 analyzed the traffic at the netblock, or range of\nIP addresses, where SSHPsychos was thought to reside\n(103.41.124.0/23). It confirmed that no legitimate traffic\nwas originating from, or destined for, that address. It nullrouted the network traffic within its own networks. Then it\ncontacted service providers for the relevant domains to ask\nthem to remove the network’s traffic.\n\nThe results of this effort were seen immediately (Figure 8).\nThe original network showed almost no new activity.\nHowever, a new network at netblock 43.255.190.0/23\nshowed large amounts of SSH brute-force attack traffic.\nIt had the same behavior that was associated with\nSSHPsychos. Following this sudden re-emergence of\nSSHPsychos-like traffic, Cisco and Level 3 decided to\ntake action against 103.41.124.0/23, as well as the new\nnetblock 43.255.190.0/23.\n\nTaking down the netblocks used by SSHPsychos did\nnot permanently disable the DDoS network. However,\nit certainly slowed down its creators’ ability to run their\noperations, and it prevented SSHPsychos from spreading\nto new machines, at least temporarily.\n\n###### Figure 8.

Top-level domain\nproviders, ISPs, hosting providers, DNS resolvers, and\nsecurity vendors can no longer sit on the sidelines when\nonline criminals launch their exploits on networks that are\nintended to carry only legitimate traffic. In other words,\nwhen criminals deliver malicious traffic in what is more or\nless plain sight, the industry must remove the malicious\npathways to these legitimate networks.\n\n\nTo learn more about Cisco and Level 3 Threat\nResearch Labs’ response to the SSHPsychos\nthreat, read the Cisco Security blog post\n[“Threat Spotlight: SSHPsychos.”](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/sshpsychos)\n\n\n###### Browser Infections: Widespread—and a\n Major Source of Data Leakage\n\nSecurity teams often view browser add-ons as a lowseverity threat. However, they should make monitoring\nthem a higher priority so that they can quickly identify and\nremediate these types of infections.\n\nThe reason for urgency: Our research indicates that\nbrowser infections are much more prevalent than many\norganizations may realize. From January to October 2015,\nwe examined 26 families of malicious browser add-ons\n(Figure 9). Looking at the pattern of browser infections\nduring these months, the number of infections seemed to\nbe on a general decline.\n\n###### Figure 9. Browser Infections, January to October 2015\n\nPercentage\n\n0.5%\n\n40%\n\n0.3%\n\nBrowser Infection Detection\n\n0\n\n\nOct.\n\n16\n\n\nJan.\n\n\nApr. Jul.\n\n**2015**\n\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report Threat Intelligence\n\n\nThis pattern is deceptive, however. The increasing\nvolume of HTTPS traffic over those months made it\ndifficult to identify the indicators of compromise typically\nassociated with the 26 families we tracked, because URL\ninformation was not visible due to encryption. (For more\non encryption, and the challenges it creates for defenders,\nsee “Encryption: A Growing Trend—and a Challenge for\nDefenders,” page 30.)\n\nMalicious browser extensions can steal information, and\nthey can be a major source of data leakage. Every time a\nuser opens a new webpage with a compromised browser,\nmalicious browser extensions collect data. They are exfiltrating\nmore than the basic details about every internal or external\nwebpage that the user visits. They are also gathering highly\nsensitive information embedded in the URL. This information\ncan include user credentials, customer data, and details about\nan organization’s internal APIs and infrastructure.\n\nMultipurpose malicious browser extensions are delivered\nby software bundles or adware. They are designed to pull\nin revenue by exploiting users in a number of ways. In an\ninfected browser, they can lead users to click on malvertising\nsuch as display ads or pop-ups. They can also distribute\nmalware by enticing users to click a compromised link or\nto download an infected file encountered in malvertising.\nAnd they can hijack users’ browser requests and then inject\nmalicious webpages into search engine results pages.\n\n\n###### Botnet Command and Control:\n A Global Overview\n\nBotnets are networks of malware-infected computers.\nAdversaries can control them as a group and command\nthem to carry out a specific task, such as sending spam\nor launching a DDoS attack. They have been growing in\nboth size and number for years. To better understand the\ncurrent threat landscape on a global scale, we analyzed the\nnetworks of 121 companies from April to October 2015 for\nevidence of one or more of eight commonly seen botnets.\nThe data was normalized to provide a general overview of\nbotnet activity (Figure 10).\n\nWe found that during this period, Gamarue—a modular,\nmultipurpose information stealer that has been around for\nyears—was the most common command-and-control threat.\n\n###### Figure 10. Growth of Individual Threats\n (Ratio of Infected Users)\n\n400\n\n\nmalicious webpages into search engine results pages.\n\nAcross the 45 companies in our sample, we determined\nthat in every month we observed more than 85 percent\nof organizations were affected by malicious browser\nextensions—a finding that underscores the massive scale\n\n0\n\nof these operations. Because infected browsers are\n\nApr. May Jun. Jul. Aug. Sep. Oct.\n\noften considered a relatively minor threat, they can go\nundetected or unresolved for days or even longer—giving **2015**\nadversaries more time and opportunity to carry out their\ncampaigns (see “Time to Detection: The Race to Keep\n\nGamarue Bedep Miuref\n\nNarrowing the Window,” page 60).\n\nVawtrak Cryptowall Other\n\nWe therefore suggest that it is well worth security teams’\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\ntime to devote more resources to monitoring this risk, and to\nconsider increased use of automation to help prioritize threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report Threat Intelligence\n\n\nA significant spike in the number of infections involving\nthe ransomware Cryptowall 3.0 was identified in July. This\nactivity is attributed largely to the Angler exploit kit, which\nis known to drop the Cryptowall payload. As reported in the\nCisco 2015 Midyear Security Report, the authors of Angler\nand other exploit kits have been quick to exploit “patching\ngaps” with Adobe Flash—the time between Adobe’s release\nof an update and when users actually upgrade.² Cisco\nthreat researchers attribute the July 2015 spike to the Flash\nzero-day exploit CVE-2015-5119 that was exposed as\npart of the Hacking Team leaks.³\n\nThe Angler exploit kit also delivers the Bedep Trojan, which\nis used to perform click-fraud campaigns. A slight spike in\nthe prevalence of that threat was noted during July as\nwell (Figure 11).\n\nBedep, Gamarue, and Miuref (another Trojan and browser\nhijacker that can perform click fraud) together represented\nmore than 65 percent of the botnet command-and-control\nactivity in the user base we analyzed.\n\n\nApr.

Malware that was\ndetermined not to use DNS in any way, or that simply used\nDNS to conduct Internet “health checks,” was removed\nfrom the sample for analysis. The remaining malware was\nusing DNS to connect to sites that were validated as bad or\nwere considered suspicious.\n\nDespite adversaries’ reliance on DNS to help further malware\ncampaigns, few companies are monitoring DNS for security\npurposes (or monitoring DNS at all). This lack of oversight\nmakes DNS an ideal avenue for attackers. According to a\nrecent survey we conducted (see Figure 13), 68 percent of\nsecurity professionals report that their organizations do\nnot monitor threats from recursive DNS. (Recursive DNS\nnameservers provide the IP addresses of intended domain\nnames to the requesting hosts.)\n\n###### Figure 13. Monitoring Threats from Recursive DNS\n\n\nWhy is DNS a security blind spot for so many organizations?\nA primary reason is that security teams and DNS experts\ntypically work in different IT groups within a company and\ndon’t interact frequently.\n\nBut they should. Monitoring DNS is essential for identifying\nand containing malware infections that are already using\nDNS for one of the three activities listed earlier. It is also\nan important first step in mapping out other components\nthat can be used for further investigating an attack, from\ndetermining the type of infrastructure supporting the attack\nto finding its source.\n\nMonitoring DNS takes more than collaboration between\nsecurity and DNS teams, however. It requires the alignment\nof the right technology and expertise for correlation\nanalysis. (For more insight, see “Industry Collaboration\nHelps Cisco Sideline Far-Reaching and Highly Profitable\nExploit Kit and Ransomware Campaign” on page 10, to\nfind out how OpenDNS helped Cisco gain more domain\nvisibility into the IPs that the Angler exploit kit was using.)\n\n**RETROSPECTIVE DNS ANALYSIS**\n\nCisco’s retrospective investigation into DNS queries and\nsubsequent TCP and UDP traffic identifies a number of\nmalware sources. These include command-and-control\nservers, websites, and distribution points. Retrospective\ninvestigation also detects high-threat content using\nintelligence from threat lists, community threat reports,\nobserved trends in cyber compromises, and knowledge of\nthe unique vulnerabilities facing a customer’s industry.\n\n\ndata exfiltration attempts commonly associated with advanced\npersistent threat (APT) behavior and which, in many cases, is\nnot captured by traditional threat detection technologies.\nThe objective of the analysis is to identify anomalies within\nthe vast quantity of outgoing communications traffic.\nThis “inside out” approach can uncover possible data\n\n###### 91.3% 68% compromises and damaging network activity that might otherwise be overlooked.\n of malware uses of organizations DNS in attacks don’t monitor\n recursive DNS\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report Threat Intelligence\n\n\nThis is how we have uncovered “rogue” DNS resolvers in\nuse on customer networks. The customers were not aware\nthat the resolvers were being used by their employees as\npart of their DNS infrastructure. Failing to actively manage\nand monitor the use of DNS resolvers can result in malicious\nbehavior such as DNS cache poisoning and DNS redirection.\n\nBesides discovering and identifying rogue DNS resolvers,\nretrospective investigation has also uncovered the following\nissues in customer networks:\n\n - Customer address space found on third-party spam\nand malware blocklists\n\n - Customer address space beaconing for known Zeus\nand Palevo command-and-control servers\n\n - Active malware campaigns, including CTB-Locker,\nAngler, and DarkHotel\n\n - Suspicious activity, including the use of Tor, email\nauto-forwarding, and online document conversion\n\n - Pervasive DNS tunneling to Chinese-registered domains\n\n - DNS “typosquatting”⁴\n\n - Internal clients bypassing the customer’s trusted\nDNS infrastructure\n\nLooking at a select sample of Cisco Custom Threat Intelligence\ncustomers across multiple verticals, we also found the\nfollowing types of malware in the respective percentage of\ntotal customers examined:\n\nAngler Exploit Kit\n\nCutwail Spam Botnet\n\n###### 4/5\n\nDyre\n\nExploit Kits (General)\n\nBedep Trojan\n\nOnion.city (Dark Search\n\n###### 3/5 Engine) Onion Router Traffic\n\nRansomware\n\n⁴ Typosquatting is the act of registering a domain name that is similar\n\nto an existing domain name; this is a strategy used by adversaries to\ntarget users who inadvertently mistype intended domain names.\n\n\n###### Threat Intelligence Analysis\n\n Web Attack Vectors\n\n**ADOBE FLASH: ON THE WAY OUT—EVENTUALLY**\n\nDespite the fact that overall Flash volume has decreased\nover the past year (see next section, “Adobe Flash and PDF\n**Content Trends”), it still remains a favored tool of exploit kit**\ndevelopers. In fact, there was no discernible trend in\nFlash malware either increasing or decreasing in 2015\n(Figure 14). Flash-related malware is likely to remain a\nprimary exploitation vector for some time: Of note, the\nAngler exploit kit authors heavily target Flash vulnerabilities.\n\n###### Figure 14. Share of Attack Vectors, 2-Year Comparison\n\nLog Volume\n\n20,000\n\n500\n\n30\n\nSep. 2013 Sep. 2015\n\nFlash Java PDF\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\nIndustry pressure to remove Adobe Flash from the browsing\nexperience is leading to a decrease in the amount of Flash\ncontent on the web (see next section, “Adobe Flash and\n**PDF Content Trends”). This is similar to what has been**\nseen with Java content in recent years, and which has, in\nturn, led to a steady downward trend in the volume of Java\nmalware (In fact, Angler’s authors don’t even bother to\ninclude Java exploits anymore). Meanwhile, the volume of\nPDF malware has remained fairly steady.\n\nMicrosoft Silverlight also has diminished as an attack vector\nbecause many vendors have discontinued supporting\nthe API that Silverlight uses to integrate into browsers.\nMany companies are moving away from Silverlight as\nthey embrace HTML5-based technologies. Microsoft has\nindicated that there is no new version of Silverlight on the\nhorizon and is currently only issuing security-related updates.\n\n20\n\n\n###### 3/5\n\n\n###### 4/5\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report Threat Intelligence\n\n\n**ADOBE FLASH AND PDF CONTENT TRENDS**\n\nCisco researchers have been watching a general decline in\nthe amount of Adobe Flash content on the web (Figure 15).\nRecent actions by Amazon, Google, and other large players\nin the Internet space are a factor for the decrease in Flash\ncontent. These companies either no longer accept web\nadvertising that uses Flash, or they block it.\n\nPDF content, meanwhile, has remained fairly stable over\nthe past year and is likely to remain so. However, it has not\nbeen a major web attack vector for some time.\n\nThe decline in Flash content is likely to continue—and\nperhaps, even accelerate—in the near term now that Adobe\nhas announced that it will be phasing out Flash.⁵ But it will\nlikely be some time before Flash content fades. Flash is\nembedded in browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft\nInternet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge and is still widely\nused in web content, including gaming and video content.\n\nHowever, in the years ahead, as new technologies are\nadopted (such as HTML5 and mobile platforms), the\nlonger-term trend for web attack vectors like Java, Flash,\nand Silverlight is becoming increasingly clear. Over time,\nthey will become less prevalent. Therefore, they are likely\nto become much less attractive vectors to profit-minded\nadversaries who focus on vectors that allow them to easily\ncompromise large populations of users and generate\nrevenue quickly.\n\n###### Figure 15.

Flash vulnerabilities still\nturn up frequently on lists of high-urgency alerts. In 2015,\nthe good news was that the vendors of products in which\nthese exploits commonly occur, such as web browsers,\nrecognized this weakness and are now taking steps to\nreduce opportunities for adversaries.\n\nIn 2016, criminals are most likely to focus their exploits\nand attacks on Adobe Flash users. Some of these Flash\nvulnerabilities have exploits available online either publicly\nor for sale as part of exploit kits. (As noted on page 21, the\nvolume of Flash-related content has declined, but Flash\nremains a primary exploitation vector.)\n\n###### Figure 18. Total Number of CVEs by Vendor\n\n\nFollowing up on tactics used to lessen the impact of Java—\nanother common threat vector—many web browsers block\nor sandbox Flash as a way to protect users. Although this\nis a positive development, it’s important to remember that\nattackers will still succeed in launching exploits for some\ntime to come. Users may fail to update their browsers\nas needed, and criminals will continue to launch exploits\naimed at older versions of browser software.\n\nHowever, Cisco researchers believe that the protections\nnow built into some commonly used web browsers and\noperating systems will lessen criminals’ reliance on Flash.\nBecause online attackers focus on achieving the best\npossible results (such as high profitability) for the most\nefficiency, they will put little effort into attacks that are less\nlikely to provide a return on investment.\n\n\n600\n\n400\n\n\n200\n\n\n0\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research, National Vulnerability Database\n\n\nThe chart above shows the total number of CVEs published **Figure 19.

Paradoxically, some may make defenders’ ability to track threats more challenging and place organizations and individual users at greater risk for compromise or attack.\n\n Encryption: A Growing Trend—and a Challenge for Defenders\n\n\nEncryption makes sense. Companies need to protect their\nintellectual property and other sensitive data, advertisers\nwant to preserve the integrity of their ad content and backend analytics, and businesses are placing more focus on\nprotecting their customers’ privacy.\n\nBut encryption also creates security issues for organizations—\nincluding a false sense of security. Organizations have\nbecome better at encrypting data when it is transmitted\nbetween entities, but data at rest is often left unsecured.\nMany of the most notable breaches in the last few years\nhave taken advantage of unencrypted data stored in the data\ncenter and other internal systems. For attackers, this is like\nfollowing a secured supply truck to an unlocked warehouse.\n\n\nObserving the trends of 2015, our researchers suggest that\nencrypted traffic, particularly HTTPS, has reached a tipping\npoint. While not yet the majority of transactions, it will soon\nbecome the dominant form of traffic on the Internet. In fact,\nour research shows that it already consistently represents\nover 50 percent of bytes transferred (Figure 25) due to the\nHTTPS overhead and larger content that is sent via HTTPS,\nsuch as transfers to file storage sites.\n\n###### Figure 25.

Due to the increase in HTTPS traffic and the extra\noverhead, we determined that HTTPS bytes represented\n57 percent of all web traffic in October 2015 (Figure 25),\nup from 46 percent in January.\n\n\n###### Figure 26.

Each one poses its\nown benefit and its own potential risk, ushering in the need\nfor an integrated threat defense that helps increase visibility.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report Industry Insights\n\n Figure 27.

Typically, only 10 percent of their\nadvertising traffic is encrypted.\n\nRegardless of the challenges, data encryption is a requirement\nin the current threat landscape. Attackers are too adept\nat circumventing access control for users to leave critical\ninformation unprotected at any stage of storage or transfer.\n\nThis is why it is essential for security teams to monitor\nweb traffic patterns to make sure that HTTPS requests\nare not coming from, or going to, suspicious locations.\nA word of caution: Don’t look for encrypted traffic over a\npredefined set of ports. As discussed in the next section, our\nresearch shows that malware is likely to initiate encrypted\ncommunications over a diverse set of ports.\n\n**THE ENTROPY FACTOR**\n\nHigh entropy is a good indication of encrypted or compressed\nfile transfers or communication.⁶ The good news for\nsecurity teams is that entropy is relatively easy to monitor\nbecause it does not require knowledge of the underlying\ncryptographic protocols.\n\n\nDuring a 3-month period beginning June 1, 2015, Cisco\nsecurity researchers observed 7,480,178 flows from\n598,138 “threat score: 100” malware samples submitted.\nThere were 958,851 high-entropy flows during this period,\nor 12.82 percent.\n\nWe also identified 917,052 flows over the Transport\nLayer Security (TLS) protocol (12.26 percent). In addition,\n8419 TLS flows were over a port other than 443—the\ndefault port for secured HTTP. Some of the ports that the\nobserved malware used for communication were ports 21,\n53, 80, and 500.\n\nAs the level of encrypted Internet traffic continues to rise,\nit will become increasingly important for organizations to\nembrace an integrated threat defense architecture (see\n“The Six Tenets of Integrated Threat Defense,” page 62).\nPoint solutions are not effective at identifying potential\nthreats in encrypted traffic. Integrated security platforms\nprovide security teams with more visibility into what’s\nhappening on devices or networks, so they can more easily\nidentify suspicious patterns of activity.\n\n\n⁶ Entropy: In computing, entropy (lack of order or predictability) is the randomness collected by an operating system or application for use in\n\ncryptography or other uses that require random data.\n\n\n32\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report Industry Insights\n\n The Move Toward Encryption: Case Data\n\n\nLancope, a Cisco company, examined encryption\nrates for both internal and Internet traffic across three\nbusiness sectors (two universities, a hospital, and an\nISP provider, all based in the United States).\n\nAt one of the universities, Lancope found that almost all\ninternal traffic was encrypted (82 percent). In addition,\n53 percent of the university’s Internet traffic was\nencrypted. These findings are on par with trends that\nLancope has observed in other industries.\n\nOnly 36 percent of the hospital’s internal data was\nencrypted. However, more than half (52 percent) of the\nInternet traffic was encrypted.\n\nAt the leading ISP provider, 70 percent of the internal\ntraffic was encrypted, and 50 percent of Internet traffic\nwas encrypted.\n\n\nThe study by Lancope tells a story of broad-based\nadoption of encryption for data in motion across various\nsectors. Cisco suggests a similar focus should now\nbe applied to the encryption of data at rest to limit the\nimpacts of organizational compromises.\n\nInternal Data Internet Data\n\n\nSource: Lancope Threat Research Labs\n\n\nHospital\n\n\nUniversity 1\n\n\n82%\n\n53%\n\nUniversity 2\n\n\n70%\n\nISP\n\n\n###### Online Criminals Increase Server Activity on WordPress\n\n\nAs discussed in the introduction to this report, online criminals\nare continually on the lookout for methods to add efficiency\nand cost savings to their operations—along with new ways to\nevade detection. Increasingly, cybercriminals are finding\nthis efficiency within websites created using WordPress,\nthe popular website and blog development platform. In\nWordPress sites, attackers can take control of a steady\nstream of compromised servers to create an infrastructure\nthat supports ransomware, bank fraud, or phishing attacks.\nThe Internet is filled with abandoned sites created\nwith WordPress that are not maintained from a security\nperspective; as new security issues surface, these sites are\noften compromised and incorporated into attack campaigns.\n\nAnalyzing the systems used to support ransomware and\nother malware, Cisco security researchers found that many\nonline criminals are shifting online activity to compromised\nWordPress servers. The number of WordPress domains\nused by criminals grew 221 percent between February and\nOctober 2015 (see Figure 28).\n\nThis shift in venue, Cisco researchers believe, has\nhappened for a couple of reasons. When ransomware\nuses other tools to communicate encryption keys or other\n\n\ncommand-and-control information, those communications\ncan be detected or blocked, which prevents the encryption\nprocess from completing. However, communications that\nrelay encryption keys through compromised WordPress\nservers may appear normal, thus increasing the chances\nthat file encryption will be completed. In other words, the\nWordPress sites act as relay agents.\n\n###### Figure 28.

WordPress\nsites offer several advantages. For example, the many\nabandoned sites give criminals more opportunities for\ncompromising sites with weak security protections.\n\nThe risk of using compromised systems to run a malware\noperation is that one of the hacked servers may be taken\ndown when the compromise is discovered. If this happens\nin the middle of a campaign, the malware downloader may\nfail to retrieve its payload or the malware may be unable\nto communicate with its command-and-control servers.\nCisco security researchers noticed that malware overcame\nthis by using more than one WordPress server; Cisco even\ndiscovered lists of compromised WordPress servers stored\non data-sharing sites such as Pastebin.\n\nThe malware used these lists to find working commandand-control servers, allowing the malware to operate even\nif a compromised server failed. Researchers also identified\nmalware downloaders that contained a list of WordPress\nsites storing payloads. If one download site was not working,\nthe malware went to the next one and downloaded malicious\npayloads from the working WordPress server.\n\nThe compromised WordPress sites were often not running\nthe latest version of WordPress, had weak admin passwords,\nand used plugins that were missing security patches.\n\n\nThese vulnerabilities allowed attackers to co-opt WordPress\nservers and use them as malware infrastructure (see Figure 29).\n\nCisco researchers have identified some of the software and\nfile types commonly hosted on compromised WordPress sites:\n\n - Executable files that are payloads for exploit kit attacks\n\n - Configuration files for malware such as Dridex and Dyre\n\n - Proxy code that relays command-and-control commu­\nnication to hide command-and-control infrastructure\n\n - Phishing webpages for collecting usernames\nand passwords\n\n - HTML scripts that redirect traffic to exploit kit servers\n\nIn addition, Cisco researchers have identified many\nmalware families that are using compromised WordPress\nsites for infrastructure:\n\n - Dridex infostealer\n\n - Pony password stealer\n\n - TeslaCrypt ransomware\n\n - Cryptowall 3.0 ransomware\n\n - TorrentLocker ransomware\n\n - Andromeda spam botnet\n\n - Bartallex Trojan dropper\n\n|Col1|Cryptowall Conne 4 Server to Get Encr|\n|---|---|\n\n\nthe latest version of WordPress, had weak admin passwords,\nand used plugins that were missing security patches.       - Necurs infostealer\n\n                                             - Fake login pages\n\n###### Figure 29.

That means they need to make IT security a\npriority. Yet many organizations rely on network infrastructures\nbuilt of components that are old, outdated, and running\nvulnerable operating systems—and are not cyber-resilient.\n\nWe recently analyzed 115,000 Cisco devices on the Internet\nand across customer environments as a way to bring\nattention to the security risks that aging infrastructure—\nand lack of attention to patching vulnerabilities—present.\n\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\nSource: Cisco Security Research\n\nWe also discovered that many of the infrastructure devices\nwe analyzed had reached their last day of support (LDoS)—\nmeaning they cannot be updated and made more secure\n(Figure 31).

As we move closer to the Internet of Things\n(IoT)—and the Internet of Everything (IoE)—it becomes more\nimportant for businesses to make sure they are relying on\na network infrastructure that is secure, thus ensuring the\nintegrity of the data and communications traversing the\nnetwork. This is critical to the success of the emerging IoE.\n\n\nMany Cisco customers built their network infrastructure a\ndecade ago. Back then, many businesses simply did not\naccount for the fact that they would be 100 percent reliant\non that infrastructure. Nor did they anticipate that their\ninfrastructure would become a prime target for adversaries.\n\nOrganizations tend to avoid making infrastructure updates\nbecause it’s expensive and requires network downtime.\nIn some cases, a simple update won’t be enough. Some\nproducts are so old they cannot be upgraded to incorporate\nthe latest security solutions needed to protect the business.\n\nThese facts alone speak to the criticality of maintaining\ninfrastructure.

In a security environment\nwhere attackers are developing more sophisticated\ntactics for entering networks and remaining undetected, no\nbusiness can afford to leave its networks unprotected, or to\nput off using processes that might offer insights on how a\ncompromise occurred so it can be avoided in the future.\n\nIn addition, SMBs may not realize that their own vulnerability\ntranslates to risks for larger enterprise customers and\ntheir networks. Today’s criminals often gain entry into one\nnetwork as a means to find an entry point into another,\nmore lucrative network—and the SMB may be the starting\npoint for such an attack.\n\n**LESS LIKELY TO HAVE EXPERIENCED**\n**PUBLIC DATA BREACHES**\n\nSMBs are less likely than large enterprises to have dealt with\na public security breach, probably a result of their smaller\nfootprint from a network standpoint. While 52 percent of\nenterprises with more than 10,000 employees have managed\nthe aftermath of a public security breach, only 39 percent of\nbusinesses with fewer than 500 employees have done so.\n\n###### Figure 37.

For\nexample, 55 percent of large enterprises outsource advice\nand consulting services, compared with 46 percent of\nbusinesses with fewer than 500 employees. Fifty-six percent\nof large enterprises outsource security auditing tasks,\ncompared with 42 percent of businesses with fewer than\n500 employees (see Figure 39).\n\nHowever, in 2015, more SMBs are outsourcing at least\nsome security services. In 2014, 24 percent of SMBs with\nless than 499 employees said they did not outsource any\nservices. In 2015, only 18 percent of SMBs said the same.\n\n###### Figure 39. More SMBs Outsource Security Services in 2015\n\n\nThe fact that more SMBs are adopting outsourcing as a\nway to manage security is good news. It says that SMBs\nare seeking flexible tools for securing networks that\ndo not place a burden on their smaller staffs or more\nconservative budgets. However, SMBs may mistakenly\nbelieve that outsourcing security processes will greatly\nreduce the likelihood of a network breach. Or they may\nplace the onus for security on a third party.

Also featured in this section are select findings from two Cisco studies. One examines executives’ concerns about cybersecurity. The other focuses on IT decision- makers’ perceptions about security risk and trustworthiness. We also give an overview of the value of an integrated threat defense architecture and provide an update on Cisco’s progress in reducing\n time to detection (TTD).\n\n Geopolitical Perspective: Uncertainty in the Internet Governance Landscape\n\n\nIn the post–Edward Snowden era, the geopolitical landscape\nfor Internet governance has changed dramatically. There\nis now pervasive uncertainty surrounding the free flow of\ninformation across borders. The landmark case brought\nby the Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems against the\nsocial networking giant Facebook had perhaps the biggest\nimpact, leading the Court of Justice of the European Union\n(CJEU) to overturn the U.S. Safe Harbor agreement on\nOctober 6, 2015.⁷\n\nConsequently, companies are now forced to rely on\nmechanisms and legal safeguards other than Safe Harbor\nwhen transferring data out of the EU to the United States—\nwhich are, in turn, subject to investigation. Data companies\nare still trying to assess the fallout from this move. And\nwhile EU and U.S. authorities have been working on a\nreplacement for Safe Harbor for the last two years, there\nare concerns about the anticipated new mechanism. It\ncould either fail to materialize by the January 2016 deadline\n\n\nor, perhaps more likely, fail to restore market confidence\nif it does not fully address the concerns of the CJEU and\nproves once more to be at risk of invalidation.⁸\n\nData protection experts expect Safe Harbor 2.0 to be no\nless controversial than its predecessor. It may even follow\nthe same path by being challenged in court and also\ndeclared invalid.⁹\n\nEnd-to-end encryption—how it benefits consumers and\norganizations, and the challenges it creates for law\nenforcement in their investigations of criminal and terrorist\nactivity—will also be a topic of much debate between\ngovernments and industry in the year ahead. The terrorist\nattacks in Paris in November 2015 have some policymakers\npushing even harder to give investigators the ability to\naccess the content of encrypted communications.¹⁰ This\ncould give additional momentum to the development of\nSafe Harbor 2.0, as civil liberties concerns take a backseat\nto security concerns.\n\n\n⁷ “The Court of Justice declares that the Commission’s U.S. Safe Harbour Decision is invalid,” CJEU, October 6, 2015:\n\n**[http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-10/cp150117en.pdf.](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-10/cp150117en.pdf)**\n\n⁸ “Safe Harbor 2.0 framework begins to capsize as January deadline nears,” by Glyn Moody, Ars Technica, November 16, 2015:\n\n**[http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/safe-harbour-2-0-framework-begins-to-capsize-as-january-deadline-nears/.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/safe-harbour-2-0-framework-begins-to-capsize-as-january-deadline-nears/)**\n\n⁹ “Safe Harbor 2.0 framework begins to capsize as January deadline nears,” by Glyn Moody, Ars Technica, November 16, 2015:\n\n**[http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/safe-harbour-2-0-framework-begins-to-capsize-as-january-deadline-nears/.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/safe-harbour-2-0-framework-begins-to-capsize-as-january-deadline-nears/)**\n\n¹⁰ “Paris Attacks Fan Encryption Debate,” by Danny Yadron, Alistair Barr, and Daisuke Wakabayashi, The Wall Street Journal, November 19, 2015:\n\n**[http://www.wsj.com/articles/paris-attacks-fan-encryption-debate-1447987407.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/paris-attacks-fan-encryption-debate-1447987407)**\n\n\n56\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report A Look Forward\n\n\nAmid such uncertainty, what should organizations ask\ndata providers in order to make sure that their business\nis in compliance with data transfer regulations? In the\nshort term, they should certainly seek assurances from\nvendors that they are using EU Model Contract Clauses or\nBinding Corporate Rules—and not just Safe Harbor—when\ntransferring data out of the EU.\n\nAnother major geopolitical issue that organizations should\nmonitor relates to vulnerabilities and exploits. Some\ngovernments are expressing great concern about the\nrise of a market for unpatched vulnerabilities—so-called\nweaponized software. Such tools are vital to the security\nresearch community as it looks for ways to protect\nnetworks around the globe. But in the wrong hands,\nparticularly those of repressive regimes, this technology,\nintended for good, could be used for financial crime, to\nsteal national and commercial secrets, suppress political\ndissent, or disrupt critical infrastructure.\n\nHow to restrict access to unpatched vulnerabilities without\ntying the hands of those conducting vital research is an issue\nthat governments will clearly wrestle with in the coming\nmonths and years. As governments attempt to tackle\nthis thorny problem, they need to carefully assess how\ntheir policymaking decisions affect security. For example,\nthe uncertainty about laws that govern the transmission\nof information about unpublished vulnerabilities could chill\nthe advancement of security threat research, or encourage\nthe publication of vulnerabilities before vendors have an\nopportunity to patch them. Any approach to resolving this\nuncertainty should be compatible across the globe.\n\n\n###### Cybersecurity Concerns Weigh on Minds of Executives\n\nObviously, in-depth security can help enterprises avoid\ncalamitous breaches and attacks. But can it help improve the\nchances of a company’s success? According to an October\n2015 Cisco study of finance and line-of-business executives\nregarding cybersecurity’s role in business and digital strategy,\nenterprise executives understand that protecting their\nbusinesses from threats may dictate whether they succeed\nor fail. As organizations become more digitized, growth will\ndepend on their ability to protect the digital platform.\n\nAs the survey shows, cybersecurity is a growing concern\nfor executives: 48 percent said they were very concerned,\nand 39 percent said they were moderately concerned about\ncybersecurity breaches. This concern is on the rise; 41 percent\nsaid they were much more concerned about security\nbreaches than they were three years ago, and 42 percent\nsaid they were a little more concerned than before.\n\nBusiness leaders are also anticipating that investors\nand regulators will ask tougher questions about security\nprocesses, just as they ask questions about other business\nfunctions. Ninety-two percent of the respondents agreed that\nregulators and investors will expect companies to provide\nmore information on cybersecurity risk exposure in the future.\n\nEnterprises also appear to have a keen sense of the cyber­\nsecurity challenges they face. The inability of cybersecurity\npolicies to keep pace with business change was the most\ncommon challenge cited, followed by the lack of metrics to\ndetermine security effectiveness (Figure 62).\n\n\n###### Figure 62.

When asked to name the types\nof information that are most difficult to protect, 32 percent\nselected “confidential financial information.” Respondents\nnamed “customer information” and “confidential business\ninformation” as the next two most difficult types of data to\nprotect (see Figure 63).\n\n###### Figure 63.

We are seeing trust become a SHARE\nmajor factor for businesses selecting IT and networking\ninfrastructure. In fact, many are now requiring that security\nand trustworthiness be integrated throughout the product\nlifecycle of the solutions that comprise their infrastructure.\n\nIn October 2015, Cisco conducted a study to assess\nIT decision-makers’ perceptions of their security risks\nand challenges and to determine the role that IT vendor\ntrustworthiness plays in their IT investments.

Phishing and advanced\npersistent threats rounded out the top three responses—\nat 54 percent and 43 percent, respectively (see Figure 65).\n\nAs for internal security challenges (see Figure 66), more\nthan half (54 percent) of our respondents cited malicious\nsoftware downloads as the top threat, followed by internal\nsecurity breaches by employees (47 percent), and hardware\nand software vulnerabilities (46 percent).\n\nWe also found that most enterprises (92 percent) employ\na dedicated security team within their organization.\nEighty-eight percent of respondents reported that they\nhave a formal, organization-wide security strategy that\nis renewed regularly. However, only 59 percent have\nstandardized policies and procedures in place to validate\nIT vendor trustworthiness (see Figure 67).\n\nIn addition, about half (49 percent) of large enterprise\norganizations keep their security infrastructure up to date\nwith the most current technologies, and most others\nupgrade their infrastructure regularly. Very few wait\nto upgrade until the technology they use is obsolete,\naccording to our study.\n\n###### Figure 65.

However, they can also help to shrink the\nattack surface by fostering an open, security-aware culture.\n\nBuilding this culture requires that organizations implement\nconsistent, enterprise-wide policies and processes\nthat ensure security is embedded into every aspect\nof the business. They must then work to extend this\nsecurity-centric mind-set to their ecosystem of partners\nand suppliers, and continually work to demonstrate\ntransparency and accountability with customers,\npartners, and other stakeholders.\n\n\nTechnology vendors demonstrate trustworthiness by:\n\n - Building security into their solutions and the value\nchain from inception\n\n - Having and following policies and processes in\nplace that reduce risk\n\n - Creating a security-aware culture\n\n - Responding to breaches quickly and transparently\n\n - Providing rapid remediation and constant\nvigilance after an incident\n\n###### Time to Detection: The Race to Keep\n Narrowing the Window\n\nWe define “time to detection,” or TTD, as the window of\ntime between the first observation of an unknown file and\nthe detection of a threat. We determine this time window\nusing opt-in security telemetry gathered from Cisco\nsecurity products deployed around the globe.\n\nThe “retrospectives” category in Figure 68 shows the\nnumber of files that Cisco initially categorized as\n“unknown” and later converted to “known bad.”\n\nAs reported in the Cisco 2015 Midyear Security Report,\nthe median TTD was about two days (50 hours).\n\n\n###### Figure 68.

In April, it had edged up slightly to 49 hours.\nHowever, by the end of May, TTD for Cisco had decreased\nto about 41 hours.\n\nSince that time, the median TTD has been on a\nrapid decline. By October, Cisco had reduced\nthe median TTD to about 17 hours—less than\none day. This far outpaces the current industry\nestimate for TTD (100 to 200 days). The speed\nis due to the inclusion of more detail about how\nshort-lived infections are mitigated.\n\nThe industrialization of hacking and the greater use of\ncommodity malware have played an important role in our\nability to narrow the window on TTD. As soon as a threat\nbecomes industrialized, it becomes more widespread and\nthus easier to detect.\n\nHowever, we also suggest that the combination of sophisti­\ncated threat defenses and close collaboration among skilled\nsecurity researchers has been perhaps even more critical to\nour ability to consistently and significantly reduce the median\nTTD over the course of 2015.\n\n\nThe TTD comparison in Figure 69 shows that many\nthreats in June were being caught within around 35.3\nhours. By October, more threats were being stopped within\naround 17.5 hours. Again, we attribute the reduction in\nmedian TTD partly to a faster identification of commodity\nmalware, such as Cryptowall 3.0, Upatre, and Dyre. The\nintegration of new technologies, such as those from\nThreatGRID, a Cisco company, is another factor.\n\nHowever, even with the narrowed time window for\nTTD, some threats remain harder to detect than others.\nDownloaders that target Microsoft Word users are\ntypically the easiest to detect (<20 hours). Adware and\nbrowser injections are among the most difficult threats to\ndetect (<200 hours).\n\nOne reason the latter threats are so challenging to detect\nis that they are typically designated as a lower priority by\nsecurity teams, and are therefore often overlooked in the\nrace to deflect adversaries’ onslaught of zero-day attacks\n(see “Browser Infections: Widespread—and a Major Source\nof Data Leakage” on page 16).\n\nFigure 70 provides an overview of the types of threats that\nusually come to light within 100 days.\n\n###### Figure 70.

The outcomes will be\nindustry consolidation and a unified movement toward a\nscalable, integrated threat defense architecture. Such an\narchitecture will provide visibility, control, intelligence, and\ncontext across many solutions.\n\nThis “detection and response” framework will make\npossible a faster response to both known and emerging\nthreats. At the core of this new architecture will be a\nvisibility platform that delivers full contextual awareness and\nis continuously updated to assess threats, correlate local\nand global intelligence, and optimize defenses. The intent\nof this platform is to build a foundation that all vendors can\noperate on and contribute to. With visibility, there is more\ncontrol, which leads to better protection across more threat\nvectors and the ability to thwart more attacks.\n\nBelow, we present six tenets of integrated threat defense\nto help organizations, and their security vendors, better\nunderstand the intent and potential benefits of this architecture:\n\n**1. A richer network and security architecture is needed**\n\n**to address the growing volume and sophistication of**\n**threat actors.**\n\nFor the past 25 years, the traditional model for security\nhas been “See a problem, buy a box.” But these\nsolutions, often a collection of technologies from many\ndifferent security vendors, don’t talk to each other in any\nmeaningful way. They produce information and intelligence\nabout security events, which are integrated into an event\nplatform and then analyzed by security personnel.\n\nAn integrated threat defense architecture is a detection\nand response framework that offers more capabilities\nand supports faster threat responses by collecting\nmore information from deployed infrastructure in an\nautomated, efficient manner. The framework observes\nthe security environment more intelligently. Instead\nof just alerting security teams to suspicious events\nand policy violations, it can paint a clear picture of the\nnetwork and what’s happening on it to help inform\nbetter decision-making around security.\n\n\n**2. Best-in-class technology alone cannot deal with the**\n\n**current—or future—threat landscape; it just adds to**\n**the complexity of the networked environment.**\n\nOrganizations invest in “best-in-class” security\ntechnologies, but how do they know if those solutions\nare really working? The headlines about major security\nbreaches over the past year are evidence that many\nsecurity technologies aren’t working well. And when\nthey fail, they fail badly.\n\nA proliferation of security vendors offering best-inclass solutions doesn’t help to improve the security\nenvironment unless those vendors offer radically\ndifferent—not just slightly different—solutions from\nthose of their competitors. But today, there are no stark\ndifferences in many offerings from leading vendors in\nmost core areas of security.\n\n**3. More encrypted traffic will require an integrated**\n\n**threat defense that can converge on encrypted**\n**malicious activity that renders particular point**\n**products ineffective.**\n\nAs discussed in this report, encrypted web traffic is on\nthe rise. There are good reasons for using encryption,\nof course, but encryption also makes it challenging for\nsecurity teams to track threats.\n\nThe answer to the encryption “problem” is to have more\nvisibility into what’s happening on devices or networks.\nIntegrated security platforms can help to provide this.\n\n**4. Open APIs are crucial to an integrated threat**\n\n**defense architecture.**\n\nMultivendor environments need a common platform that\nprovides greater visibility, context, and control. Building\na front-end integration platform can support better\nautomation and bring better awareness into the security\nproducts themselves.\n\n**5. An integrated threat defense architecture requires**\n\n**less gear and software to install and manage.**\n\nSecurity vendors should strive to offer platforms that\nare as feature-rich as possible and that offer extensive\nfunctionality on one platform. This will help to reduce\nthe complexity and fragmentation in the security\nenvironment that create too many opportunities for\neasy access and concealment for adversaries.\n\n62\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report A Look Forward\n\n**6.
