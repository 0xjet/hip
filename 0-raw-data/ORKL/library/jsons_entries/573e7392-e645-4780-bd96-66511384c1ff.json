    "plain_text": "# Exploiting a crisis: How cybercriminals behaved during the outbreak\n\n**[microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/16/exploiting-a-crisis-how-cybercriminals-behaved-during-the-outbreak/](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/06/16/exploiting-a-crisis-how-cybercriminals-behaved-during-the-outbreak/)**\n\nJune 16, 2020\n\nIn the past several months, seemingly conflicting data has been published about\ncybercriminals taking advantage of the COVID-19 outbreak to attack consumers and\nenterprises alike. Big numbers can show shifts in attacker behavior and grab headlines.\nCybercriminals did indeed adapt their tactics to match what was going on in the world, and\nwhat we saw in the threat environment was parallel to the uptick in COVID-19 headlines and\nthe desire for more information.\n\nIf one backtracked to early February, COVID-19 news and themed attacks were relatively\nscarce. It wasn’t until February 11, when the World Health Organization named the global\nhealth emergency as “COVID-19”, that attackers started to actively deploy opportunistic\ncampaigns. The week following that declaration saw these attacks increase eleven-fold.\nWhile this was [below two percent of overall attacks Microsoft saw each month, it was clear](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/08/microsoft-shares-new-threat-intelligence-security-guidance-during-global-crisis/)\nthat cybercriminals wanted to exploit the situation: people around the world were becoming\naware of the outbreak and were actively seeking information and solutions to combat it.\n\nWorldwide, we observed COVID-19 themed attacks peak in the first two weeks of March.\nThat coincided with many nations beginning to take action to reduce the spread of the virus\nand travel restrictions coming into effect. By the end of March, every country in the world had\nseen at least one COVID-19 themed attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Trend of COVID-19 themed attacks_\n\nThe rise in COVID-19 themed attacks closely mirrored the unfolding of the worldwide event.\nThe point of contention was whether these attacks were new or repurposed threats. Looking\nthrough [Microsoft’s broad threat intelligence on endpoints, email and data, identities, and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/08/microsoft-shares-new-threat-intelligence-security-guidance-during-global-crisis/)\napps, we concluded that this surge of COVID-19 themed attacks was really a repurposing\nfrom known attackers using existing infrastructure and malware with new lures.\n\nIn fact, the overall trend of malware detections worldwide (orange line in Figure 2) did not\nvary significantly during this time. The spike of COVID-19 themed attacks you see above\n(yellow line in Figure 1) is barely a blip in the total volume of threats we typically see in a\nmonth. Malware campaigns, attack infrastructure, and phishing attacks all showed signs of\nthis opportunistic behavior. As we documented previously, these cybercriminals even\ntargeted key industries and individuals working to address the outbreak. These shifts were\ntypical of the global threat landscape, but what was peculiar in this case was how the global\nnature and universal impact of the crisis made the cybercriminal’s work easier. They preyed\non our concern, confusion, and desire for resolution.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Trend of overall global attacks vs. COVID-19 themed attacks_\n\nAfter peaking in early March, COVID-19 themed attacks settled into a “new normal”. While\nthese themed attacks are still higher than they were in early February and are likely to\ncontinue as long as COVID-19 persists, this pattern of changing lures prove to be outliers,\nand the vast majority of the threat landscape falls into typical phishing and identity\ncompromise patterns.\n\nCybercriminals are adaptable and always looking for the best and easiest ways to gain new\nvictims. Commodity malware attacks, in particular, are looking for the biggest risk-versusreward payouts. The industry sometimes focuses heavily on advanced attacks that exploit\nzero-day vulnerabilities, but every day the bigger risk for more people is being tricked into\nrunning unknown programs or Trojanized documents. Likewise, defenders adapt and drive\nup the cost of successful attacks. Starting in April, we observed defenders greatly increasing\nphishing awareness and training for their enterprises, raising the cost and complexity barrier\nfor cybercriminals targeting their employees. These dynamics behave very much like\neconomic models if you turn “sellers” to “cybercriminals” and “customers” to “victims”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Trend of COVID-19 themed attacks_\n\n## Lures, like news, are always local\n\nCybercriminals are looking for the easiest point of compromise or entry. One way they do this\nis by ripping lures from the headlines and tailoring these lures to geographies and locations\nof their intended victims. This is consistent with the plethora of phishing studies that show\n[highly localized social engineering lures. In enterprise-focused phishing attacks this can look](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/09/06/small-businesses-targeted-by-highly-localized-ursnif-campaign/)\nlike expected documents arriving and asking the user to take action.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, cybercriminals closely mimicked the local developments of\nthe crisis and the reactions to them. Here we can see the global trend of concern about the\noutbreak playing out with regional differences. Below we take a deeper look at three\ncountries and how local events landed in relation to observed attacks.\n\n### FOCUS: United Kingdom\n\nAttacks targeting the United Kingdom initially followed a trajectory similar to the global data,\nbut spiked early, appearing to be influenced by the news and concerns in the nation. Data\nshows a first peak approximately at the first confirmed COVID-19 death in the UK, with\ngrowth beginning again with the FTSE 100 stock crash on March 9, and then ultimately\npeaking around the time the United States announced a travel ban to Europe.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Trend of COVID-19 themed attacks in the United Kingdom showing unique_\n_encounters (distinct malware files) and total encounters (number of times the files are_\n_detected)_\n\nIn the latter half of March, the United Kingdom increased transparency and information to the\npublic as outbreak protocols were implemented, including the closure of schools. The attacks\ndropped considerably all the way to April 5, when Queen Elizabeth II made a rare televised\naddress to the nation. The very next day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was\nhospitalized on April 6 due to COVID-19, was moved to intensive care. Data shows a\ncorresponding increase in attacks until April 12, the day the Prime Minister was discharged\nfrom the hospital. The level of themed attacks then plateaued at about 3,500 daily attacks\nuntil roughly the end of April. The UK government proclaimed the country had passed the\npeak of infections and began to restore a new normalcy. Attacks took a notable drop to\naround 2,000 daily attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Sample COVID-19 themed lures in attacks seen in the UK_\n\n### FOCUS: Republic of Korea\n\nThe Republic of Korea was one of the earliest countries hit by COVID-19 and one of the\nmost active in combating the virus. We observed attacks in Korea increase and, like the\nglobal trend, peak in early March. However, the spike in attacks for this country is steeper\nthan the worldwide average, coinciding with the earlier arrival of the virus here.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Trend of COVID-19 themed attacks in the Republic of Korea showing unique_\n_encounters (distinct malware files) and total encounters (number of times the files are_\n_detected)_\n\nInterestingly, themed attacks were minimal at the beginning of February despite the impact of\nthe virus. Cybercriminals did not truly ramp up attacks until the middle of February, closely\nmapping key events like identifying patients from the Shincheonji religious organization,\nmilitary base lock downs, and international travel restrictions. While these national news\nevents did not create the attacks, it’s clear cybercriminals saw an opening to compromise\nmore victims.\n\nIncreased testing and transparency about the outbreak mapped to a downward trajectory of\nattacks in the first half of March. Looking forward through the end of May, the trend of\nthemed attacks targeting Korean victims significantly departed from the global trajectory. We\nobserved increasing attacks as the country restored some civic life. Attacks ultimately\nreached a peak around May 23. Analysis is still ongoing to understand the dynamics that\ndrove this atypical increase.\n\n### FOCUS: United States\n\nCOVID-19 themed attacks in the United States largely followed the global attack trend. The\ninitial ascent began mid-February after the World Health Organization officially named the\nvirus. Attacks reached first peak at the end of February, coinciding with the first confirmed\nCOVID-19 death in the country, and hit its highest point by mid-March, coinciding with the\nannounced international travel ban. The last half of March saw a significant decrease in\n\n\n-----\n\nthemed attacks. Telemetry from April and May shows themed attacks leveling off between\n20,000 and 30,000 daily attacks. The same pattern of themed attacks mirroring the\ndevelopment of the outbreak and local concern likely played out at the state level, too.\n\n_Figure 7. Trend of COVID-19 themed attacks in the United States showing unique_\n_encounters (distinct malware files) and total encounters (number of times the files are_\n_detected)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Sample COVID-19 themed lures in attacks seen in the US_\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has truly been a global event. Cybercriminals have taken advantage\nof the crisis to lure new victims using existing malware threats. In examining the telemetry,\nthese attacks appear to be highly correlated to local interest and news.\n\nOverall, COVID-19 themed attacks are just a small percentage of the overall threats the\nMicrosoft has observed over the last four months. There was a global spike of themed\nattacks cumulating in the first two weeks of March. Based on the overall trend of attacks it\nappears that the themed attacks were at the cost of other attacks in the threat environment.\n\nThese last four months have seen a lot of focus on the outbreak – both virus and cyber. The\nlessons we draw from Microsoft’s observations are:\n\nCybercriminals adapt their tactics to take advantage of local events that are more likely\nto lure victims to their schemes. Those lures change quickly and fluidly while the\nunderlying malware threats remain.\n\n\n-----\n\nDefender investment is best placed in cross-domain signal analysis, update\ndeployment, and user education. These COVID-19 themed attacks show us that the\nthreats our users face are constant on a global scale. Investments that raise the cost of\nattack or lower the likelihood of success are the optimal path forward.\nFocus on behaviors of attackers will be more effective than just examining indicators of\ncompromise, which tend to be more signals in time than durable.\n\nTo help organizations stay protected from the opportunistic, quickly evolving threats we saw\nduring the outbreak, as well as the much larger total volume of threats, Microsoft Threat\nProtection (MTP) provides cross-domain visibility. It delivers coordinated defense by\norchestrating protection, detection, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and\napps.\n\nOrganizations should further improve security posture by educating end users about spotting\nphishing and social engineering attacks and practicing credential hygiene. Organizations can\nuse [Microsoft Secure Score to assesses and measure security posture and apply](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score?view=o365-worldwide)\nrecommended improvement actions, guidance, and control. Using a centralized dashboard in\nMicrosoft 365 security center, organizations can compare their security posture with\nbenchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\n### Talk to us\n\nQuestions, concerns, or insights on this story?
