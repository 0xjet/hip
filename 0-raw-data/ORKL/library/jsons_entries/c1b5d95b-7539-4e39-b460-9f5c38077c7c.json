    "plain_text": "# New Insights into Energetic Bear’s Watering Hole Cyber Attacks on Turkish Critical Infrastructure\n\n**riskiq.com/blog/labs/energetic-bear/**\n\nNovember 2, 2017\n\nLabs\n\nNovember 02, 2017\n\nBy Yonathan Klijnsma\n\n[On October 20th US-CERT published an alert (TA-17-293A) with information about the](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-293A)\nactivities of an APT targeting the critical infrastructure sector. The report contains an\nextensive set of indicators with detailed context and information around them. Part of the\nRussian sphere of influence, the threat group discussed in the US-CERT report is the\n[perpetrator of documented cyber espionage attacks around the world, many of which target](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/energetic-bear-under-the-microscope/d/d-id/1297712?)\nindustrial and manufacturing firms and critical infrastructure. Known by many names, the\n[group is most prominently known as ‘Energetic Bear’ and ‘Crouching Yeti.’](https://community.riskiq.com/projects/bd02b44d-5c0a-0b8f-9336-54f509bf191c)\n\nDetailed analysis of Energetic Bear’s malware and activities was recently done by\nKaspersky, and RiskIQ initially investigated them earlier this year. Through our web crawling\nnetwork, we were able to determine that a website belonging to a Turkish energy company\nwas being used in a watering hole attack targeting people associated with Turkish critical\ninfrastructure. Compromised via a supply chain attack, the site was injected with SMB\n\n\n-----\n\ncredential-harvesting malware. RiskIQ then linked the malicious infrastructure to a string of\nrelated Turkish sites that were compromised for the same purpose and traced the attack\nback to a likely timeframe in which it began.\n\nWatering hole attacks, especially those involving supply chain compromises, have been an\n[extremely effective method for operators of cyber espionage campaigns because they target](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/fake-flash-update-watering-hole-attack/)\nvictims of specific groups, organizations, and regions, and with close but tumultuous\nrelations between Turkey and the Russian Federation, Turkey is not a surprising target for\nEnergetic Bear. We shared our findings with law enforcement and national CERT partners,\nbut now that the indicators have become public per US-CERT’s publication, we want to give\nour unique point of view on the threat.\n\n## Strategical Compromise for Reconnaissance\n\nPart of Energetic Bear's campaign involved strategical web compromises that give them\nexposure to specific targets. For example, prior activities from the group include\ncompromising software suppliers for programmable logic controller (PLC) components used\n[in critical infrastructure and backdooring them with the Havex malware. In the case of the](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2014-10&post=Full-Disclosure-of-Havex-Trojans)\ncampaign described in the US-CERT report, the group compromised the website of Turcas\nPetrol, a Turkish energy company, located at turcas.com.tr.\n\nFig-1 turcas.com.tr\n\n\n-----\n\nIn May 2017, during one of our crawls of Turcas’ website, RiskIQ encountered a watering\nhole setup in use by Energetic Bear. In the screenshot of the website above, you can see\nfour top elements: ‘Join the Turcas Energy Family,' ‘Announcements,' ‘Company News,’ and\n‘Tv interviews.' These separate elements are structured as iframes to other pages on the\nwebsite as shown in the DOM capture below:\n\nFig-2 DOM capture showing the modified subsection\n\nHowever, the iframe'd page for the 'Announcements' subsection was modified by Energetic\nBear operators to contain a small addition in the form of an image inclusion:\n\nFig-3 Malicious image inclusion\n\nThe image URL redirects to a link using the file:// scheme, which forces the connection\nthrough the file protocol, which then allows the group to harvest Microsoft SMB credentials.\nThis behavior was also noted by Talos, which wrote a detailed analysis of the spear-phishing\n\n\n-----\n\n[emails belonging to the same campaign as this watering hole attack. It s interesting to note](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/template-injection.html)\nthat the back-end server used in the attack seems to be written using the TornadoServer\nPython framework used for building web and networking applications:\n\nFig-4 Response headers showing the back-end server\n\nIn the case of Turcas Petrol, below is the entire chain of events we observed during the\ncrawl:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig-5 The entire chain of events observed by RiskIQ\n\nIn and of itself, this compromise seems targeted at Turcas Petrol and those with a close\nrelationship with the business, a tactic that mirrors other Energetic Bear campaigns.\nEssentially, the group's goal is to influence areas of interest to the Russian Federation. What\nwe’d like to show, which seems to be missing from the US-CERT report, is the entire chain of\nevents for this attack.\n\n[RiskIQ found that the SMB credential harvesting host at 184.154.150.66 is not always](https://community.riskiq.com/search/184.154.150.66)\n[directly included on the websites. Instead, the intermediary host at 103.41.177.58 is usually](https://community.riskiq.com/search/103.41.177.58)\npresent on the web pages, which, in turn, redirect visitors—most likely with some filtering to\navoid unwanted traffic—to the SMB harvesting host. Additionally, the URL format of the file\nrequested, which in this case was turcas_icon.png, is not related to the referring website.\nInstead, Energetic Bear seems to use a form of tagging to correlate any possible victims and\ntheir source website. The format we observed is <tag>_icon.png and <tag>.png.\n\n## Strategical Compromise for Broad Targeting\n\nThe previous example of the Turcas Petrol website compromise showed specific targeting.\nWhile company-specific websites were compromised in this campaign, ‘general purpose’\n[websites were also amongst the victims. One such site is plantengineering.com which serves](https://community.riskiq.com/search/www.plantengineering.com)\nas an information and news hub for the critical infrastructure sector\n\n\n-----\n\nFig-6 Another compromised website linked to the attack\n\nFor a few months in early 2017, this website had one of its resources compromised, likely\nmeaning that Energetic Bear operators had broad access to the server. On the main page of\nthe website, a resource loads from /typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js as\nseen in our crawl:\n\nFig-7 Compromised resource\n\n[The compromised resource is a modified version of jQuery Easing JavaScript library. At the](https://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/)\nbottom of the script, we can find the SMB credential harvesting link, which is embedded as\nan image element in the main page’s DOM:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig-8 SMB credential harvesting link\n\nWhen we go through more of our data for this very simplified direct image inclusion, we find\na pattern in the URLs and websites. Here are three of our hits:\n\n[https://www.plantengineering.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js](https://community.riskiq.com/search/www.plantengineering.com)\n\n[https://www.csemag.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js](https://community.riskiq.com/search/www.csemag.com)\n\n[https://www.controleng.com/typo3conf/ext/t3s_jslidernews/res/js/jquery.easing.js](https://community.riskiq.com/search/www.controleng.com)\n\nAll three URLs are the same, as is the injected content. All the affected websites are news\nand information websites for the industrial sector, which indicates a definite pattern. So, who\nowns these websites? Looking at the WHOIS information in PassiveTotal we find\n[plantengineering.com is owned by CFE Media LLC:](https://community.riskiq.com/search/plantengineering.com)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig-9 WHOIS record for affected sites\n\n[Reading a bit further, we find the email address srourke@cfemedia.com was used to register](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/srourke@cfemedia.com)\nthe domain. Pivoting off this address we can see the same pattern that we saw with the\nURLs:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig-10 Other affected sites\n\nFrom our data, RiskIQ found that [controleng.com,](https://community.riskiq.com/search/controleng.com) [plantengineering.com, and](https://community.riskiq.com/search/controleng.com) [csemag.com](https://community.riskiq.com/search/csemag.com)\nwere all affected by the injection from Energetic Bear. Because they’re geared toward\nengineers working in the critical infrastructure sector and thus prime targets for this watering\nhole attack, the odds are that CFE Media’s other websites were affected. In fact, CFE Media\nhas at least [six confirmed brands that publish news and information:](https://www.cfemedia.com/publishing-brands/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig-11 Brands affected by the Energetic Bear campaign\n\nBecause we started seeing Energetic Bear's SMB-harvesting injection at the end of March\nand our crawl data from the end of January was still clean, RiskIQ has been able to pinpoint\nthe start of the campaign to between the beginning of February and the end March.\n\n## Conclusion: Don't Feed the Bear\n\nOver the past few years, supply-chain attacks are becoming more and more prevalent in the\nattacker’s portfolio. JavaScript can be changed and compromised without the knowledge of\nthe site owner, finding its way onto a site when public code was modified downstream. To\nprevent this, site owners must have an understanding of what belongs to their organization,\nhow it’s connected to the rest of their asset inventory, including inventorying all the third-party\ncode running on their web assets so they can avoid being a pawn by operators like Energetic\nBear.\n\n[Signing up for RiskIQ Community Edition now gives you access to one of the most popular](https://www.riskiq.com/products/community-edition/)\nRiskIQ products–Digital Footprint.
