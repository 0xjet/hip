Backdoor trojans give threat\nactors remote control over the victim’s computer, allowing them to send, receive, launch and\ndelete files.\n\neSentire’s research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU), discovered that hackers are\nspearphishing victims with a malicious zip file using the job position listed on the target’s\nLinkedIn profile. For example, if the LinkedIn member’s job is listed as Senior Account\n_Executive—International Freight the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account_\n_Executive—International Freight position (note the “position” added to the end). Upon_\nopening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiates the stealthy installation of the fileless\nbackdoor, more_eggs. Once loaded, the sophisticated backdoor can download additional\nmalicious plugins and provide hands-on access to the victim’s computer. The threat group\nbehind more_eggs, Golden Chickens, sell the backdoor under a malware- as- aservice(MaaS) arrangement to other cybercriminals. Once more_eggs is on the victim’s\ncomputer system, the Golden Eggs seedy customers can go in and infect the system with\nany type of malware: ransomware, credential stealers, banking malware, or simply use the\nbackdoor as a foothold into the victim’s network so as to exfiltrate data.\n\n## What Risk Does More_Eggs Backdoor Pose to Organizations and Business Professionals\n\n“What is particularly worrisome about the more_eggs activity is that it has three elements\nwhich make it a formidable threat to businesses and business professionals,” said Rob\nMcLeod, Sr. Director of the Threat Response Unit (TRU) for eSentire. They are:\n\n1. It uses normal Windows processes to run so it is not going to typically be picked up by\nanti-virus and automated security solutions so it is quite stealthy.\n\n2.Including the target’s job position from LinkedIn in the weaponized job offer increases the\nodds that the recipient will detonate the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n3.Since the COVID pandemic, unemployment rates have risen dramatically. It is a perfect\ntime to take advantage of job seekers who are desperate to find employment. Thus, a\ncustomized job lure is even more enticing during these troubled times.\n\nThese three elements make more_eggs, and the cybercriminals which use this backdoor\nvery lethal.”\n\n## More_Eggs Attack Steps\n\nIn the spearphishing incident, which the TRU team disrupted, the target was a professional\nworking in the healthcare technology industry. Upon downloading and executing the alleged\njob file, the TRU team saw that the victim unwittingly executed VenomLNK, an initial stage of\nmore_eggs. By abusing Windows Management Instrumentation, VenomLNK enables the\nmalware’s plugin loader, TerraLoader, which then hijacks legitimate Windows processes,\ncmstp and regsvr32. (See Image 1). While TerraLoader is being initiated, a decoy word\ndocument is presented to the victim. The document is designed to impersonate a legitimate\nemployment application, (See Image 2) but it serves no functional purpose in the infection. It\nis merely used to distract the victim from the ongoing background tasks of more_eggs.\nTerraLoader then installs msxsl in the user’s roaming profile and loads the payload,\nTerraPreter, an ActiveX control (.ocx file) downloaded from Amazon Web Services. At this\npoint, TerraPreter begins beaconing to a Command & Control server (C2) via the rogue copy\nof msxsl. The beacon signals that the more_eggs backdoor is ready for Golden Chicken’s\ncustomer to log in and begin carrying out their goal, whether it is to infect the victim with\nadditional malware, such as ransomware, or to get a foothold into the victim’s network so as\nto exfiltrate data. eSentire’s security analysts disrupted the operation, and the TRU began\ninvestigating.\n\n## What Makes More_Eggs So Stealthy\n\nMore_eggs maintains a stealthy profile by abusing legitimate Windows processes and feeds\nthose process instructions via script files. Additionally, campaigns using the MaaS offering\nappear to be sparse and selective in comparison to typical malspam distribution networks.\nBecause of the stealth and spearphishing capabilities of the more_eggs operation, the\nGolden Chickens threat group enjoys patronage from notable advanced threat groups, such\nas FIN6, Cobalt Group and Evilnum.\n\n## Who is the Cybercriminal Gang Behind the Current LinkedIn Spearphishing Activity?\n\nThus far, the TRU team has not discovered forensics indicating the identity of the hacking\ngroup which is trying to spearphish the LinkedIn members. However, as mentioned, this\nmalware-as a service has been used by three notable threat groups: FIN6, Cobalt Group and\nEvilnum.\n\n\n-----\n\n## What are the Hackers After?\n\nSince this spearphishing attack was disrupted, the TRU team cannot know with certainty\nwhat the end game is for this incident. What we do know is that this current activity mirrors\n[an eerily similar campaign which was reported in February 2019, where U.S. retail,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fake-jobs-campaigns-delivering-moreeggs-backdoor-fake-job-offers)\nentertainment and pharmaceutical companies, which offer online shopping, were targeted.\nThe threat actors went after employees of these companies with fake job offers, cleverly\nusing the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles, in their communications to the employees.\nSimilar to the current incident, they also used malicious email attachments and if the target\nclicked on the attachment, they got hit by more_eggs.\n\n## Connection Between FIN6, Evilnum, Cobalt Group and More_Eggs\n\n**FIN6- FIN6 is a financial cybercrime group that primarily steals payment card data and sells**\nit on underground marketplaces. The FIN6 group first gained notoriety in 2014 for their\nattacks against point- of- sale (POS) machines in retail outlets and hospitality companies.\nContinuing their quest for credit and debit card data, they later moved on to targeting eCommerce companies and stole their credit card data via online skimming. The FIN6 threat\ngroup has also been known to infect some of their victims with ransomware.\n\n[Interestingly, researchers reported in Feb. 2019 that FIN6 was specifically targeting](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf)\nnumerous e-Commerce companies and using malicious documents to infect their targets\nwith more_eggs as the initial phase of their attack. This could be the same campaign, which\nwas reported in Feb. 2019 and which we previously mentioned--- in which threat actors were\nobserved attacking retail, entertainment and pharmaceutical companies’ online payments\nsystems and using malicious documents, laden with more_eggs, to target the companies’\nemployees. Of course, it could be a separate campaign entirely. However, what we do know\nis that the targets (eCommerce companies) and tools (more_eggs) were used in both\nreported attack campaigns.\n\nLater that year, in August 2019, security researchers found that the FIN6 group began\nanother malicious campaign. The researchers believe the FIN6 threat actors were actively\ngoing after multinational organizations. Similar to the current incident, FIN6 spearphished\nspecific employees with fake job offers. If the targets fell for the lure, they too were infected\nwith the more_eggs backdoor.\n\n**Evilnum- The Evilnum cybercrime group is best known for compromising financial**\ntechnology companies, companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools. Their\ntarget is financial information about the targeted FINTECH companies and their customers.\nThey target items such as spreadsheets and documents with customer lists, investments and\ntrading operations and credentials for trading software/platforms and software.\n\n\n-----\n\nCoincidentally, the [Evilnum group is also known to spearphish employees of the companies](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/09/more-evil-deep-look-evilnum-toolset/)\nthey are targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees get hit with the\nmore_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.\n\n**Cobalt Group-** [The Cobalt Group is also known to go after financial companies, and it has](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/cobalt_upd_ttps/)\nrepeatedly used the more_eggs backdoor in their attacks.\n\n## What is the Victim’s Industry?\n\nThe LinkedIn member is in the healthcare technology sector.\n\n**Image1: An outline of how the more_eggs backdoor behaves once it is initiated by the**\nvictim.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Image 2: Word document which poses as an employment application which is served up to**\nthe business professional once they download the zip file which alleges to be a job offer.\n\n## Indicators\n\n**C2 beacon: d27qdop2sa027t.cloudfront[.]net**\n\n**Download Server: ec2-13-58-146-177.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws[.]com**\n\n**.zip hash: 776c355a89d32157857113a49e516e74**\n\n**Ipconfig: cmd /v /c ipconfig /all > \"C:\\Users\\**\n**<REDACTED>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\64813.txt\" 2>&1**\n\n**regsvr32 /s /u \"C:\\Users\\<REDACTED>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\**\n**<REDACTED>.ocx”**\n\n**sh = new ActiveXObject(\"Shell.Application\")**\n\n\n-----\n\n**sh.ShellExecute( msxsl.exe, <REDACTED>.txt <REDACTED>.txt, C:\\Users\\**\n**<REDACTED>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\\", \"\", 0)**\n\n**evlinum js: C:\\Users\\<REDACTED>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\57930.ocx**\n\n## Timelines\n\n[1] https://quointelligence.eu/2020/01/the-chicken-keeps-laying-new-eggs-uncovering-newgc-maas-tools-used-by-top-tier-threat-actors/\n\n[2] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fake-jobs-campaigns-deliveringmoreeggs-backdoor-fake-job-offers\n\n\n-----",
