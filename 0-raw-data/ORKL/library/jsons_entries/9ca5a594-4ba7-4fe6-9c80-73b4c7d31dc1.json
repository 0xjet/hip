    "plain_text": "# Netherlands can use intelligence or armed forces to respond to ransomware attacks\n\n**[therecord.media/netherlands-can-use-intelligence-or-armed-forces-to-respond-to-ransomware-attacks/](https://therecord.media/netherlands-can-use-intelligence-or-armed-forces-to-respond-to-ransomware-attacks/)**\n\nOctober 7, 2021\n\nImage: Jason Leung\nThe Dutch government said it would use its intelligence or military services to counter cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks, that threaten its national security.\n\nAnswering a parliamentary inquiry into the country’s possible avenues of response to\nransomware attacks, Ben Knapen, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, said under normal\ncircumstances, diplomatic avenues take precedence, but the country’s response could be\nescalated in the case of more severe incidents.\n\n“If a ransomware attack, whether or not with a financial objective, crosses the threshold of a\n(manifesting) threat to national security, for example due to the failure of critical sectors, then\n[the government also has other resources at its disposal,” Knapen said in a letter to the Dutch](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21080172-tegenmaatregelen_ransomware-aanvallen)\nParliament.\n\nThis process would involve investigating the attack, attributing it to a specific threat actor,\nand taking action against the aggressor.\n\n“An example of the latter is taking IT infrastructure offline (or having it taken offline) that is\npart of the attack infrastructure or that is misused for digital espionage or sabotage,” Knapen\ntold the Dutch Parliament.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to action by [intelligence] services, the Netherlands can also respond with the\nArmed Forces. For example, the Defense Cyber  Command can carry out a counter-attack at\n_the end of the day to avert an enemy action or to protect an essential interest of the state,”_\nKnapen added (emphasis taken from the minister’s letter).\n\n## A warning shot for ransomware operators\n\nKnapen said the Netherlands does not respond to all cyber-attacks in this manner but\nordinarily relies on “diplomatic or legal channels” first.\n\nBut such responses are not unheard of. For example, following a series of attacks carried out\nby a state-sponsored hacking group known as APT29, the Dutch intelligence service AIVD\nhacked them back in 2014, with their intrusion allowing AIVD to warn the US State\nDepartment of an impending cyber operation.\n\nHowever, Knapen told the Parliament that the Netherlands has not yet faced a ransomware\nattack large or severe enough to require involvement from its intelligence or military forces.\n\nRansomware attacks have hit Dutch companies in the past but only in isolated attacks,\nusually targeting private sector operators.\n\nHowever, reading between the lines, the Dutch official’s letter is also a shot across the bow\nto ransomware gangs—a clear threat that if they cross the line, the Dutch state will reply,\nwithout warning and regardless of the country they operate from.\n\n[The move also comes after UK officials announced this week a similar plan to use the](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/10/02/britain-capable-launching-offensive-cyber-attacks-against-russia/)\noffensive cyber capabilities of their intelligence services to go after foreign threats, including\nransomware gangs.\n\nTags\n\n[AIVD](https://therecord.media/tag/aivd/)\n[Government](https://therecord.media/tag/government/)\n[intelligence agency](https://therecord.media/tag/intelligence-agency/)\n[military](https://therecord.media/tag/military/)\n[Netherlands](https://therecord.media/tag/netherlands/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record. He previously worked at ZDNet\nand Bleeping Computer, where he became a well-known name in the industry for his\nconstant scoops on new vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and law enforcement actions against\nhackers.\n\n\n-----",
