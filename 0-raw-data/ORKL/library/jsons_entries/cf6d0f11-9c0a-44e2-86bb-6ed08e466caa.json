First of all, you should setup your secret key, which\n     is located in tsh.h; the key can be of any length (use\n     at least 12 characters for better security).\n    2. It is advised to change SERVER_PORT, the port on which\n     the server will be listening for incoming connections.\n    3. You may want to start tshd in \"connect-back\" mode if\n     it runs on on a firewalled box; simply uncomment and\n     modify CONNECT_BACK_HOST in tsh.h.\n  * Compiling Tiny SHell\n    Run \"make <system>\", where <system> can be any one of these:\n    linux, freebsd, openbsd, netbsd, cygwin, sunos, irix, hpux, osf\n  * How to use the server\n    It can be useful to set $HOME and the file creation mask\n    before starting the server:\n      % umask 077; HOME=/var/tmp ./tshd\n  * How to use the client\n    Make sure tshd is running on the remote host. You can:\n    - start a shell:\n      ./tsh <hostname>\n    - execute a command:\n      ./tsh <hostname> \"uname -a\"\n    - transfer files:\n      ./tsh <hostname> get /etc/shadow .\n      ./tsh <hostname> put vmlinuz /boot\n    Note: if the server runs in connect-back mode, replace\n    the remote machine hostname with \"cb\".\n  * About multiple file transfers\n    At the moment, Tiny SHell does not support scp-like multiple\n    and/or recursive file transfers. You can work around this bug\n    by simply making a tar archive and transferring it. Example:\n    ./tsh host \"stty raw; tar -cf - /etc 2>/dev/null\" | tar -xvf \n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  * About terminal modes\n    On some brain-dead systems (actually, IRIX and HP-UX), Ctrl-C\n    and other control keys do not work correctly. Fix it with:\n      % stty intr \"^C\" erase \"^H\" eof \"^D\" susp \"^Z\" kill \"^U\"\n  * About security\n    Please remember that the secret key is stored in clear inside\n    both tsh and tshd executables; therefore you should make sure\n    that no one except you has read access to these two files.\n    However, you may choose not to store the real (valid) key in\n    the client, which will then ask for a password when it starts.\n\n```\n\n-----",
