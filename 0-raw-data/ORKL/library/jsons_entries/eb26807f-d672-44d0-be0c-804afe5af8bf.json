An earlier list of IOCs attached to this_\n_blog was generated through an automated system and, due to the dual-use nature of the_\n_tools used by the group, erroneously included some low fidelity IoCs._\n\nSymantec researchers have uncovered a previously unknown attack group that is\ntargeting government and military targets, including several overseas embassies of an\nEastern European country, and military and defense targets in the Middle East. This group\neschews custom malware and uses living off the land (LotL) tactics and publicly available\nhack tools to carry out activities that bear all the hallmarks of a cyber espionage\ncampaign.\n\n\n-----\n\ntools https://symc.ly/2RBkaR8\"\n[Click to Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%23Gallmaker eschews custom malware, uses living off the land and publicly available hack tools https://symc.ly/2RBkaR8&via=threatintel)\nThe group, which we have given the name Gallmaker, has been operating since at least\nDecember 2017, with its most recent activity observed in June 2018.\n\n## Tactics and tools\n\nThe most interesting aspect of Gallmaker’s approach is that the group doesn’t use\nmalware in its operations. Rather, the attack activity we observed is carried out\nexclusively using LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools. The group takes a number\nof steps to gain access to a victim’s device and then deploys several different attack tools,\nas follows:\n\n1. The group delivers a malicious Office lure document to victims, most likely via a\n\nspear-phishing email.\n2. These lure documents use titles with government, military, and diplomatic themes,\n\nand the file names are written in English or Cyrillic languages. These documents are\nnot very sophisticated, but evidence of infections shows that they’re effective. The\nattackers use filenames that would be of interest to a variety of targets in Eastern\nEurope, including:\n\n_bg embassy list.docx_\n_Navy.ro members list.docx_\n\n3. These lure documents attempt to exploit the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data\n\nExchange (DDE) protocol in order to gain access to victim machines. When the\nvictim opens the lure document, a warning appears asking victims to “enable\ncontent” (See Figure 1). Should a user enable this content, the attackers are then\nable to use the DDE protocol to remotely execute commands in memory on the\nvictim’s system. By running solely in memory, the attackers avoid leaving artifacts\non disk, which makes their activities difficult to detect.\n4. Once the Gallmaker attackers gain access to a device, they execute various tools,\n\nincluding:\n\nWindowsRoamingToolsTask: Used to schedule PowerShell scripts and tasks.\nA \"reverse_tcp\" payload from Metasploit: The attackers use obfuscated shellcode\nthat is executed via PowerShell to download this reverse shell.\nA legitimate version of the WinZip console: This creates a task to execute\ncommands and communicate with the command-and-control (C&C) server. It’s likely\nthis WinZip console is used to archive data, probably for exfiltration.\nThe Rex PowerShell library, which is publicly available on GitHub, is also seen on\nvictim machines. This library helps create and manipulate PowerShell scripts for\nuse with Metasploit exploits.\n\nGallmaker is using three primary IP addresses for its C&C infrastructure to communicate\nwith infected devices. There is also evidence that it is deleting some of its tools from\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. An example of the type of warning displayed by the lure document\n\nThe DDE protocol can be used for legitimate purposes to send messages between\nMicrosoft applications that share data through shared memory, e.g. to share data between\nExcel and Word.\n\n[However, the DDE protocol was flagged as unsecure last year, when researchers](https://www.cyberscoop.com/dde-microsoft-word-vulnerability-feature/)\ndiscovered it could be exploited to execute code on victim machines via Excel and Word,\nwithout macros being enabled in those applications. Microsoft said at the time that this\ncapability was a feature and the company did not consider it a vulnerability because Office\nalways warned users before enabling DDE in documents, as seen in Figure 1. However,\nafter the DDE protocol was subsequently exploited in a number of malware campaigns,\nMicrosoft issued an update to Office in December 2017 that disabled DDE by default in\nWord and Excel. DDE can be enabled manually after this update is applied but only if the\nregistry is altered by an admin account.\n\nThe Gallmaker victims we have seen did not have this patch installed and therefore were\nstill vulnerable to exploit via the DDE protocol.\n\n## Targets and timeline\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment, military, or defense sectors. Several targets are embassies of an Eastern\nEuropean country. The targeted embassies are located in a number of different regions\nglobally, but all have the same home country.\n\nThe other targets we have seen are a Middle Eastern defense contractor and a military\norganization. There are no obvious links between the Eastern European and Middle\nEastern targets, but it is clear that Gallmaker is specifically targeting the defense, military,\nand government sectors: its targets appear unlikely to be random or accidental.\n\nGallmaker’s activity has been quite consistent since we started tracking it. The group has\ncarried out attacks most months since December 2017. Its activity subsequently\nincreased in the second quarter of 2018, with a particular spike in April 2018.\n\nFigure 2. Gallmaker activity, December 2017 to June 2018\n\nGallmaker’s activity points strongly to it being a cyber espionage campaign, likely carried\nout by a state-sponsored group.\n\nGallmaker may well have continued to avoid detection were it not for Symantec’s Targeted\nAttack Analytics (TAA) technology.\n\n## How did we discover Gallmaker?\n\nThe fact that Gallmaker appears to rely exclusively on LotL tactics and publicly available\nhack tools makes its activities extremely hard to detect. We have written extensively about\nthe increasing use of LotL tools and publicly available hack tools by cyber criminals. One\nof the primary reasons for the increased popularity of these kinds of tools is to avoid\ndetection; attackers are hoping to “hide in plain sight”, with their malicious activity hidden\nin a sea of legitimate processes.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttack Analytics (TAA) technology. TAA combines the capabilities of Symantec’s worldleading security experts with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning to\nprovide organizations with their own “virtual analysts”, via our Advanced Threat Protection\n(ATP) product. Since its inception, TAA has detected security incidents at thousands of\norganizations, automating what would have taken many hours of analyst time. In this\ninstance, TAA identified the specific PowerShell commands used by Gallmaker as being\nsuspicious, leading to the discovery of this new campaign. Without TAA’s advanced AIbased capabilities, Gallmaker’s activities may well have remained undetected.\n\n## Protection\n\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Gallmaker attacks:\n\n[System Infected: Meterpreter Reverse TCP](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=25678)\n\n[W97M.Downloader](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2014-110100-2117-99)\n\nNetwork protection products also detect activity associated with Gallmaker.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nThe following indicators are specific to Gallmaker:\n\n### Network\n\n111[.]90.149.99/o2\n94[.]140.116.124/o2\n94[.]140.116.231/o2\n\n### Filenames\n\nbg embassy list.docx\nNavy.ro members list.docx\nБГ в чуждите медии 23.03.2018-1.docx\n\n[REDACTED] and cae join forces to develop integrated live virtual constructive\ntraining solutions.docx\nА-9237-18-brasil.docx\n\nGallmaker also used tools that were available in open source projects. Yara rule and\nmethods shared below were used by Gallmaker but aren't exclusive to the group's activity.\nDetection of these in one's environment is only indicative of possible unauthorized\nactivity.
