In a tweet today,\nLiska said that none of the previous ransomware attacks were severe enough to cause longterm damage to a company’s market listing, with the price taking only small hits for very short\nperiods.\n\n[Shorting ransomware victim stock is something that @thegumshoo and I have been](https://twitter.com/thegumshoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nspeculating about for a while. BUT, most companies don’t take a noticeable hit in their\n[stock price after a ransomware attack – at least not long term. https://t.co/CIBGN13Sl6](https://t.co/CIBGN13Sl6)\n\n[— Allan “Ransomware Sommelier🍷” Liska (@uuallan) April 22, 2021](https://twitter.com/uuallan/status/1385255244033105920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, any large short bets are most likely to be picked up and investigated by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory bodies, and not many traders are\nlikely to take up Darkside’s offer for such minimal gains and maximum regulatory risks.\n\nTags\n\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Darkside](https://therecord.media/tag/darkside/)\n[extortion](https://therecord.media/tag/extortion/)\n[NASDAQ](https://therecord.media/tag/nasdaq/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[SEC](https://therecord.media/tag/sec/)\n[stock market](https://therecord.media/tag/stock-market/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
