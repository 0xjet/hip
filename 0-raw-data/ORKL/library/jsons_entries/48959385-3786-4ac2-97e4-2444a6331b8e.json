In\nJanuary 2022, the U.S. Cyber Command attributed the actor to the country’s Ministry of\nIntelligence and Security (MOIS).\n\n\n-----\n\n[MuddyWater is also believed to be a “conglomerate of multiple teams operating](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-hackers-using-new-spying.html)\nindependently rather than a single threat actor group,” the cybersecurity firm added, making\n[it an umbrella actor in the vein of Winnti, a China-based advanced persistent threat (APT).](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/winnti_umbrella)\n\nThe latest campaigns undertaken by the hacking crew involve the use of malware-laced\ndocuments delivered via phishing messages to deploy a remote access trojan called\nSloughRAT (aka [Canopy by CISA) capable of executing arbitrary code and commands](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/irans-muddywater-hacker-group-using-new.html)\nreceived from its command-and-control (C2) servers.\n\nThe maldoc, an Excel file containing a malicious macro, triggers the infection chain to drop\ntwo Windows Script Files (.WSF) on the endpoint, the first one of them acting as the\ninstrumentor to invoke and execute the next-stage payload.\n\nAlso discovered are two additional script-based implants, one written in Visual Basic and the\nother coded in JavaScript, both of which are engineered to download and run malicious\ncommands on the compromised host.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Furthermore, the latest set of intrusions marks a continuation of a November 2021 campaign](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/researchers-uncover-new-iranian-hacking.html)\nthat struck Turkish private organizations and governmental institutions with PowerShellbased backdoors to gather information from its victims, even as it exhibits overlaps with\nanother campaign that took place in March 2021.\n\nThe commonalities in tactics and techniques adopted by the operators have raised the\npossibility that these attacks are “distinct, yet related, clusters of activity,” with the campaigns\nleveraging a “broader TTP-sharing paradigm, typical of coordinated operational teams,” the\nresearchers noted.\n\nA second phishing attack sequence between December 2021 and January 2022 concerned\nthe deployment of VBS-based malicious downloaders using scheduled tasks created by the\nadversary enabling the execution of payloads retrieved from a remote server The results of\n\n\n-----\n\nthe command are subsequently exfiltrated back to the C2 server.\n\n“While they share certain techniques, these campaigns also denote individuality in the way\nthey were conducted, indicating the existence of multiple sub-teams beneath the\nMuddywater umbrella — all sharing a pool of tactics and tools to pick and choose from,” the\nresearchers concluded.\n\n\n-----",
