This\nis the story of GoldenHelper.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n## Story Highlights\n\n**Trustwave SpiderLabs has discovered malware embedded in Chinese tax software. This campaign was active in 2018-2019,**\n**prior to the GoldenSpy campaign and is hidden in the Golden Tax Invoicing Software (Baiwang Edition), required by Chinese**\n**banks for payment of VAT taxes.**\n**The new malware is entirely different from GoldenSpy, although the delivery modus operandi is highly similar. We named this**\n**family GoldenHelper, based on its association with the Chinese National Golden Tax project and one of the primary Command**\n**and Control domains: help.tax-helper.ltd.**\n**Although called \"Baiwang Edition\", GoldenHelper was digitally signed by NouNou Technologies, a subsidiary of Aisino**\n**C** **ti** **th** **ibl** **f** **th** **I t lli** **t T** **S ft** **ith** **b dd d G ld** **S** **l**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Go de** **e pe** **a** **a e ut** **es sop** **st cated tec** **ques to** **de ts de** **e y, p ese ce, a d act** **ty So** **e o t e** **te est** **g**\n**techniques GoldenHelper uses include randomization of name whilst in transit, randomization of file system location,**\n**timestomping, IP-based DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm), UAC bypass and privilege escalation.**\n**Our current telemetry shows that GoldenHelper is designed to drop a final payload, called taxver.exe. Trustwave SpiderLabs**\n**has not yet been able to obtain a copy of this file and is requesting assistance from our readers to contact us at**\n**[goldenspy@trustwave.com if they have information on this file or a sample for us to analyze.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:goldenspy@trustwave.com)**\n**Reference the original story of GoldenSpy malware** **[here.](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/the-golden-tax-department-and-the-emergence-of-goldenspy-malware/)**\n\n## Golden Tax Project\n\nDuring major fiscal reforms in 1994, China began a value-add tax (VAT) system requiring businesses to pay tax on the difference of their\nrevenue represented on invoices and their expenses. During this same timeframe the \"Golden Tax Project\" (GTP) was launched to centralize\nVAT tax invoicing and fight against tax fraud using sophisticated software and spearheaded by the former Premier of the State Council,\nComrade Zhu Rongji. This objective was clear after listening to reports from Ministry of Electronics, the Aerospace Industry Corporation,\nMinistry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation.\n\nWhile this is one of many \"Golden\" PRC projects, it is in its third phase and known as Golden Tax III which began in 2016. Now fully\nimplemented since 2017, online issuance of VAT invoices and uploads can occur to a centralized back-end database linking all e-invoicing. At\nthis time, there are only two official providers of the invoicing systems, Aisino and Baiwang.\n\n## The Golden Gateway\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Trustwave SpiderLabs team issued an Emerging Threat Report about the GoldenSpy backdoor malware. In the full\nreport we concluded that while we were not aware of any ongoing attack, the backdoor had several characteristics that could lead to a major\ncompromise. As reported, the GoldenSpy malware is installed as part of the mandated Tax Software produced by Aisino. To recap, the\nsuspicious characteristics of GoldenSpy are:\n\nCovert download; two hours after the Intelligent Tax software is installed.\nTwo autostart services created to monitor and restart itself.\nUninstalling the tax software does not uninstall the GoldenSpy binaries.\nBeaconing traffic to a domain that is not related to the tax software.\nRunning with system level privileges and allowing for remote code execution.\n\nSince the Trustwave SpiderLabs report went public, our team has discovered the Aisino tax software downloading and running an uninstaller,\nremoving all evidence of the GoldenSpy malware. Again, the team released the information to the public via the Trustwave SpiderLabs blog:\n[https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/goldenspy-chapter-two-the-uninstaller/](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/goldenspy-chapter-two-the-uninstaller/)\n\nSeveral characteristics make this suspicious as well:\n\nJune 28 – Uninstaller spotted in the wild pushed from 223.112.21.2:8090\nJune 29 – Uninstaller is obfuscated with Base64 encoding\nJuly 1 – New uninstaller pushed with further obfuscation to escape Yara Rule released by Trustwave SpiderLabs\n\nSince our GoldenSpy publications, many people from the security community have reached out and shared their GoldenSpy related threat\nintelligence. As this intelligence collaboration continued, the Trustwave SpiderLabs team became aware of another Golden Tax invoice\nsoftware containing malicious code. The software is linked to Aisino, as was GoldenSpy, and has the following suspicious characteristics:\n\nDoes not require a user’s permission to install and escalate to SYSTEM level privilege (UAC bypass)\nRandomly generated filenames (Obfuscation)\nRandomly generated \"Creation\" and \"Last write\" timestamp (Timestomping)\nAttempts to download an executable using fake filenames with .gif, .jpg, .zip (Obfuscation)\nHardcoded logic to control download location, what to download and where to place it based on results of DNS resolution (DNS Control)\n\nAlthough this malware is functionally very different from GoldenSpy, the delivery modus operandi is highly similar. We will refer to these new\nsamples as GoldenHelper, based on its relation to the Golden Tax project and its tax-helper domain C2 infrastructure. The installation process\nflow for this software is shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: GoldenHelper execution process flow\n\nThis malware utilizes three different .dll files:\n\n1. DLL – to interface with the Golden tax software\n2. DLL – to bypass Windows security and escalate privileges\n3. {random_name}.DAT – to download and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privilege\n\nThe final payload, taxver.exe, is downloaded and executed, and could be located in several locations in the file system. To date, Trustwave\nSpiderLabs has been unable to procure a sample of taxver.exe. We are actively requesting community assistance in this endeavor. If you\n[have information on taxver.exe, or can provide a sample, please reach out to us at: goldenspy@trustwave.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:goldenspy@trustwave.com)\n\nDetailed malware analysis will be provided later in this report.\n\nThe Golden Tax Project is a national program in China, impacting every business operating in China. We are currently aware of only two\norganizations authorized to produce Golden Tax software, Aisino and Baiwang. This is now the second Golden Tax software package that\nTrustwave SpiderLabs has found to contain a hidden backdoor capable of remotely executing arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges.\n\nDuring our investigation, we have been informed that the Golden Tax software may be deployed in your environment as a stand-alone system\nprovided by the bank. Several individuals report receiving an actual Windows 7 computer (Home edition) with this Golden Tax software (and\nGoldenHelper) preinstalled and ready to use. This deployment mechanism is an interesting physical manifestation of a trojan horse.\n\nIt is important to remember that as a security community protecting critical data and infrastructure, we must remain vigilant and weigh all\noptions and risks individually. Trustwave SpiderLabs understands that the VAT tax invoice software is a government requirement and\nrecommends that any system hosting third-party applications with a potential for adding a gateway into your environment, be isolated and\nheavily monitored with strict processes and procedures in their usage.\n\n## GoldenHelper Campaign Timeline\n\nTrustwave SpiderLabs does not believe that the GoldenHelper campaign is currently active because the command and control domains\nutilized by the dropper mechanisms described in this report expired in January 2020. However, we have not yet been able to obtain a sample\nof taxver.exe, the final payload of the attack, and cannot confirm if it uses the same network infrastructure. So, the threat contained within the\nfinal payload of this attack may still be active.\n\nThe timeline below shows the currently confirmed dates relevant to the GoldenHelper campaign. The dates include domain registration and\nexpiration and malware sample compilation. It is important to note that we have not recovered every sample likely to be involved with this\ncampaign (first recovered skpc.dll was version 2.1.0.11), however, our analysis makes it clear that GoldenHelper was active from January\n2018 until July 2019. This leads directly into the launch of the GoldenSpy campaign in April 2020 (only to be prematurely shut down in June\n2020, due to Trustwave SpiderLabs public exposure of the incident details).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: GoldenHelper campaign timeline\n\nWe cannot definitively know why the GoldenHelper campaign was abruptly abandoned in July 2019. The incremental malware development\ncycle continued for the known samples from early 2018 to July 2019 and the domains associated with the it expired and were released in\nJanuary 2020. It is important to note that the final version of Skpc.exe (2.1.0.17) was released July 25, 2019 and it contained no malicious\nartifacts. Hence, anyone installing the Baiwang edition of the Golden Tax Invoicing Software after July 2019 would not be impacted by this\ncampaign. While this taxver.exe deployment mechanism appears to no longer be active, it is important to understand that taxver.exe may still\nbe an active and operational threat on countless victim networks. We cannot know its purpose until we obtain and analyze a sample.\n\nWe can hypothesize on the reasoning for the end of GoldenHelper in July 2019. The pictures below show the VirusTotal detection rates for\nthe various samples during the first quarter of 2019. All saw a significant jump in detection ratios during that time frame. Wmiasssrv.dll was\ndetected by 1/71 antivirus engines in January of 2019, compared to 29/71 by March of 2019. Similarly, RandomName.dat was identified as\nmalicious by 3/71 AV engines in January 2019, and 26/71 in March 2019. We believe that the increasing antivirus engine detection capability\ncontributed to the decision to abandon the GoldenHelper campaign in January 2020.\n\nFigure 3: Wmiasssrv.dll – Detection increases on March 2019\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: RandomName.dat detection increases on March 2019\n\nFigure 5: Skpc.dll 2.1.0.13 – Detection increases on April 2019\n\nFigure 6: Skpc.dll 2.1.0.16 – Detection increases on June 2019\n\nThe GoldenHelper deployment mechanism may no longer be active, but we cannot say if the overall threat presented by taxver.exe is still\noperational, or not. The GoldenHelper campaign was directly followed by GoldenSpy, and while Trustwave SpiderLabs was able to quickly\nidentify and expose the current iteration of GoldenSpy, leading the adversaries to draw down the campaign, we have no doubt that this threat\nwill continue to evolve to a new methodology targeting businesses with operations in China.\n\n## What is taxver.exe?\n\n\n-----\n\ne Go de e pe ca pa g s des g ed to co e t y do oad a d e ecute a a pay oad t S S e e p eges ca ed ta e e e\nWe currently do not have a sample of this file and cannot state its purpose. However, there are a few key characteristics that are important for\nhunters to consider:\n\n1. exe cannot be directly identified by searching network traffic, based on the algorithm the dropper utilizes, it will appear to be one of\n\nseveral names while in transit:\n\njpg\ngif\ndat\nrar\nzip\n\n1. When copied to the victim file system, it will be called taxver.exe, however, based on the randomization algorithm, it may be located in\n\nany of the following paths:\n\n\"%WINDIR%\\system32\\taxver.exe\n\"%WINDIR%\"\\debug\\wia\\taxver.exe\n\"%WINDIR%\"\\debug\\taxver.exe\n\"%WINDIR%\"\\taxver.exe\n\"%ALLUSERPROFILE%\"\\taxver.exe\n\"%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\"\\taxver.exe\n\n1. While we do not have a sample of taxver.exe and cannot confirm that it is malicious, it is important to note that legitimate software does\n\nnot:\n\nUtilize UAC bypass to evade Windows security controls and escalate privilege\nRandomize file system location\nHide its name and true nature in network traffic\nLack version negotiation protocols\nA legitimate updater tends to have its main control protocol purposely designed rather than overriding DNS records\n\n## Indicators of Compromise: Files\n\nAs stated, we believe the GoldenHelper campaign was active from January 2018 to July 2019. During that time, the adversary created\nseveral variations of their malware. The versions listed below are all of the samples that Trustwave SpiderLabs could recover from this\ncampaign, although the list is likely not complete. Behaviorally, there are no substantive changes amongst the different versions, except for\nthe last one, Skpc.dll Version 2.1.0.17, which contains no malicious artifacts. We suspect that at the point when this version was released, the\nGoldenHelper campaign was being rolled back due to increasing antivirus detection rates.\n\n**File Name** **>MD5** **PE Compile Time** **Version** **Malware Artifacts** **Verdict**\n\n\nmsxxxs999.dat\n\n(RandomName.dat)\n\n\n490d17a5b016f3abc14cc57f955b49b3 2018:03:20 00:26:36 Service DLL Yes Malicious\n\n\nWmiasssrv.dll 682a0826db8572bad205a4db12005e13 2018:10:09 12:26:36 Service Dropper Yes Malicious\n\nWmiasssrv.dll 26e71f1d387298162c1b19e858d001a1 2018:10:09 12:26:36 Service Dropper Yes Malicious\n\nSkpc.dll 9e2ebdbc9ba4dca69a712e3268f3ab77 2018:10:23 3:30:26 2.1.0.11 Yes Malicious\n\nSkpc.dll fbb35e8f16e7d5a735f06ae03e8bfaac 2019:03:15 08:53:30 2.1.0.13 Yes Malicious\n\nSkpc.dll 61eed90b1ae70244cd87a3abd3ec622a 2019:03:15 08:53:30 2.1.0.13 Yes Malicious\n\nSkpc.dll d312336fd46972a544929d0dc4e07b83 2019:03:15 08:53:30 2.1.0.13 Yes Malicious\n\nSkpc.dll 27d448f9d2bed761e15541c55b5966f2 2019:05:27 01:28:44 2.1.0.16 Yes Malicious\n\nSkpc.dll bee06d785b7e51a0127a96c5854d4345 2019:05:27 01:28:44 2.1.0.16 Yes Malicious\n\nSkpc.dll 471c75acc284396354c89616f9030718 2019:07:25 09:12:33 2.1.0.17 No Clean\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of compromise: Domains\n\nThe Randomname.dat file is not actually fully random. Its name will always begin with \"ms\", followed by three random characters, then \"s\",\nthen a number. Put another way, the file is named like this: ms{3-random-chars}s{0-999}.dat. This report will just refer to RandomName.dat to\nreduce confusion. Of course, this file is not a data or configuration file, as would be expected from a .dat extension. Rather, this is an\nexecutable file, utilizing the thin veil of obfuscation by changing the extension.\n\nRandomName.dat contacts the following 3 hard-coded domains whose response is delivered in the format of an IP address, but each octet of\nthe IP address actually contains the hidden instructions for delivery of the final payload. Hidden within the IP address are instructions for\nwhere to download taxver.exe from, what to name it in transit, and where to save it on the victim file system. Each of the following domains\nwill be resolved until one returns the expected IP address. While the GoldenHelper campaign was active, all of these domains were\nregistered to Chengdu West Dimension Digital Technology Co., LTD. They were all registered around the same time and the registration for\neach was allowed to expire in January 2020.\n\n**Domain** **Actor registration** **Deletion due to expiry**\n\ntax-helper.ltd 3/8/18 2/5/20\n\ntax-assistant.com 3/6/18 3/1/20\n\ntax-assistant.info 1/27/18 2/4/20\n\n## Introduction to the Players\n\nAisino Corporation plays a central role in both the GoldenHelper and GoldenSpy campaigns. The Trustwave SpiderLabs’ GoldenSpy report\nclearly shows how Aisino produced the \"Intelligent Tax Software\", but utilized a company called Nanjing Chenkuo Network Technology to\nproduce the GoldenSpy malware. In the case of the \"Golden Tax Invoicing software (Baiwang Edition)\", NouNou Technology Ltd. produced\nboth the legitimate tax software and the hidden GoldenHelper malware. NouNou Technology is a subsidiary of Aisino, and Aisino’s website\nstates that they are owned by state company CASIC (China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation Limited).\n\nIt is worth noting that although the Golden Tax Invoicing Software is referred to as \"Baiwang Edition\", we could not identify any links between\nBaiwang and the software development. The only link we found was that the software utilized an API connection to Baiwang cloud\ninfrastructure for the legitimate tax transactions.\n\nThe diagram below shows the corporate relationships behind both GoldenHelper and GoldenSpy campaigns. For color schema reference:\n\nGreen indicates legitimate usage by tax software\nOrange indicates Aisino Corporation and its subsidiaries\nRed indicates shadow backdoor network infrastructure\nBlue is the overall background of the Chinese Golden Tax Project\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Skpc.dll 2.1.0.16 – Organizations and their roles ini GoldenSpy and GoldenHelper\n\nBased on the GoldenHelper and GoldenSpy campaigns, several similar characteristics present themselves:\n\nA subsidiary of Aisino corporation creates Golden Tax related software.\nThe tax software utilizes dedicated infrastructure and components (installer, uninstaller, updater and main tax software). Components\nare installed and uninstalled on user demand and approval and properly conduct legitimate tax operations.\nHidden malware is installed alongside the legitimate tax software.\nHidden malware utilizes separate network command and control infrastructure than used by the tax software.\nHidden malware has the ability to remotely download and execute arbitrary code at SYSTEM level privilege.\nHidden malware uses obfuscation techniques to hide deployment and communication methodologies.\n\n## Corporate Profiles:\n\n**Golden Tax Project (GTP): Project established in 1994 to monitor and administer VAT collection across the People’s Republic of China. It**\nobligates companies to utilize state approved software in order to perform VAT operations. The project aims to support counter fraud\ndetection by adding heuristic and AI cloud modeling.\n\n**Aisino Corporation: (Aerospace Information Joint Stock LLC. - 航天信息股份有限公司) Listed IT company specializing in information**\nsecurity.

It should be noted\nthat during our dynamic analysis kp.exe was not dropped by the installer, we have not determined whether this is because it was designed to\nbe retrieved as an update or whether a packed version requires a specific trigger to drop.\n\n**skpc.dll**\n\nWe are specifically analyzing version 2.1.0.13 of this file with hash\n99244e4186047a6531177fd189b3c299efa7db869db7ed307e3afa372913f306. Version 2.1.0.16 has a similar behavior while version 2.1.0.17\nhas this behavior removed.\n\nskpc.dll is launched by the sc.exe component of the tax software. As noted, we are analyzing version 2.1.0.13 but during execution it writes\nthe following entries to the file nisec_yyyy-mm-dd.log.

This library (also referred to as WMI Assistant Patch) exports a number of\nfunctions and contains a further embedded dll. skpc.dll calls the WriteLibrary function from wmiasssrv.dll to install this third nested dll as a\nservice. There are several aspects of this installation process which raise red flags.\n\nThe first suspicious aspect is that the third dll is not named as such but rather is given a random name using the format ms{aaa}s{999}.dat.\nThis file is dropped in C:\\Windows\\system32 and installed as a service with full system privileges using a UAC bypass technique.\n\n[The specific UAC bypass used is documented at https://msitpros.com/?p=3960 and abuses a COM elevation moniker technique by creating](https://msitpros.com/?p=3960)\nan inf file and launching the inf file using the COM CMSTPLUA object. The contents of the inf file are below.

These domains\ndrive the download of taxver.exe according to the algorithm described above. During the period when the first version of this software was\nactive, all of these domains were registered through the registrar Chengdu West Dimension Digital Technology Co., LTD. While the actual\norganization which registered the domains is hidden by a WHOIS privacy service, they were all registered at about the same time and the\nregistration on each was allowed to expire about two years later. Based on this we believe that all were registered by the same organization\nand that the time they were registered is in the middle of the preparation period for this campaign.\n\n**Domain** **Actor registration** **Deletion due to expiry**\n\ntax-helper.ltd 3/8/18 2/5/20\n\ntax-assistant.com 3/6/18 3/1/20\n\ntax-assistant.info 1/27/18 2/4/20\n\nThe second set of domains are the ones used for the actual payload download. While the first set of domains are in our list of Indicators of\nCompromise (IOCs), we recommend not using the second set for this purpose because some of them belong to organizations we believe are\nnot associated with the campaign. The purpose of the software including these unaffiliated domains is unclear.\n\n**Domain** **Actor domain registration** **Deletion due to expiry** **Owned by campaign**\n\ninfo.tax-assistant.com 3/6/18 3/1/20 Yes\n\ninfo.tax-assistant.info 1/27/18 2/4/20 Yes\n\ninfo.tax-helper.ltd 3/8/18 2/5/20 Yes\n\ntip.tax-helper.ltd 3/8/18 2/5/20 Yes\n\nbbs.tax-helper.info n/a n/a No\n\nupdate.tax-helper.ltd 3/8/18 2/5/20 Yes\n\ndownload.tax-helper.com n/a n/a No\n\ntools.tax-helper.info n/a n/a No\n\nupdate.tax-helper.com n/a n/a No\n\ninf.tax-assistant.com 3/6/18 3/1/20 Yes\n\n## YARA Rule for Hunting:\n\nAs we have for every iteration of GoldenSpy, Trustwave SpiderLabs is providing the following GoldenHelper YARA rule to help with\nGoldenHelper hunting operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Go de** **e pe ya**\n\nrule GoldenHelper\n\n{\n\nmeta:\n\nauthor = \"SpiderLabs\"\n\nvariant = \"GoldenSpy\"\n\nfiletype = \"exe_dll\"\n\nfeatures = \"UAC bypass,Updater,Dropper,ServiceDLL\"\n\nversion = \"2.0\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$str1 = \"WMPAssis_AddReg\" wide ascii\n\n$str2 = \"wmsma.inf\" wide ascii\n\n$str3 = \"taxhelper\" wide ascii\n\n$str4 = \"WMP Assistant Patch\" wide ascii\n\n$str5 = \"Elevation:Administrator\" wide ascii\n\ncondition:\n\n(uint16(0) == 0x5A4D) and 4 of ($str*)\n\n}\n\n## Thank you to our Contributors:\n\nWhen Trustwave SpiderLabs first published our research on the GoldenSpy campaign, on June 25, 2020, we set up an information sharing\n[email address goldenspy@trustwave.com that is delivered directly to the security research team. Our hope was to confidentially crowdsource](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:goldenspy@trustwave.com)\ncyber threat intelligence sharing to expand our telemetry into the GoldenSpy campaign. This turned out to be enormously successful as many\ncompanies reached out to us to share their experiences and the impact of GoldenSpy within their environment.\n\nThis sharing led us to the discovery of GoldenHelper and allowed us to further our investigations into supply-chain compromises associated\nwith the Chinese Golden Tax Project. We would like to thank everyone that contacted us, shared their experience, and enabled us to\ncontinually educate the public on this threat. Your effort will benefit countless organizations in similar situations.\n\nHowever, there is still a gap in this story. We have not yet identified a sample of the final GoldenHelper payload, taxver.exe. We do not know\n[its purpose, capabilities, or IOCs. Therefore, we are keeping open the goldenspy@trustwave.com email address and welcome further intel](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:goldenspy@trustwave.com)\nsharing regarding GoldenSpy, GoldenHelper, or any other related compromise.\n\n[1] [https://www.jss.com.cn/Contents/portal/allow/aboutus/about.ftl](https://www.jss.com.cn/Contents/portal/allow/aboutus/about.ftl)\n\n[2] [http://www.baiwang.com/mainsite-new/about](http://www.baiwang.com/mainsite-new/about)\n\n\n-----",
