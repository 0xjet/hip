As with most phishing emails, there is a compelling\ncall to action for the receiver, in this case a contract award from a well-known organization.\nAnd, an added bonus unknown to the receiver, the emails also contained a malicious\nattachment designed to siphon data from its targets.\nIncluded is an example of one of these emails along with basic Triage header information.\n\nEach email analyzed contained instructions to open an attached .ace archive file that when\ndecompressed revealed a Windows executable containing Loki Bot Malware.\n\nLoki Bot is a commodity malware sold on underground sites which is designed to steal\nprivate data from infected machines, and then submit that info to a command and control\nhost via HTTP POST. This private data includes stored passwords, login credential\ninformation from Web browsers, and a variety of cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nThe following Loki Bot executable was identified during our analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Filename** **MD5** **Size**\n\nshellOil.ace 5d70858b154c8b0eb205e84ca7f27a04 118,473\n\nShell Oil.exe 6a95ae2c90a4a3c5a2c1ce3eaf399966 245,760\n\nUpon infecting a machine, this malware performs a callback to the following command and\ncontrol host reporting the new infection and submitting any private data stolen during the\ninfection process.\n\n**Command and Control URL** **IP Address** **Location**\n\nhxxp://elmansy.net/pdf/fre.php 118.193.173.208 China\n\n\n-----\n\nThe command and control domain elmansy.net was created almost exactly a year ago on\n[2016-03-18 with the email address sherif-elfmanns[email protected] The IP address reveals](https://phishme.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nthat the domain is being hosted out of Jiangsu, China.\n\n**Take Away**\n\nAs always, PhishMe cautions our customers to be wary of emails requesting information or\npromising reward. Specific to this sample, we recommend that customers be observant for\nemails containing the subject line “Request for quotation” or emails promising business with\nnew or unknown businesses. PhishMe Simulator customers who feel this type of offer might\nbe successful with its employees should consider launching simulations that follow this style\nof attack to further train their users.\n\nAdditionally, incident responders should consider blocking the domain and IP address\nmentioned above, as well as searching endpoint systems for the MD5’s if internal systems\nsupport it.\n\n_The Phishing Defense Center is the hub for our remotely managed PhishMe Triage services._\n_The fully staffed center manages all internal reported emails for a number of organizations._\n_All information shared has been cleansed of any identifiable data._\n\nDon't miss out on any of our phishing updates!
