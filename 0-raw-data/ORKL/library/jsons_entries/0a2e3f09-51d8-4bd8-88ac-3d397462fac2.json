Congratulations! You are one of the 100 users that we selected to receive the chance to win an [sic] Samsung Galaxy S10,\nSamsung Galaxy S9 or Apple iPhone 12. You have 4 minutes and 27 seconds to answer the following questions before we give your gift to\nanother happy user! Good luck!\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of those lucky ones who bought the story that they were a winner and rushed to answer the questions eventually lost their money.\nMessages about lotteries and surveys are one of the most popular scamming schemes, and they have recently increased in scope, their\ntechnological sophistication, personalization scale, and last but not least, severity.\n\nOne of the major success factors behind this scheme is the use of special targeted links, customized for a specific victim. Group-IB Digital\nRisk Protection analysts have recorded the presence of this targeted scam in over 90 countries worldwide, with over 120 international brands\nexploited in the fraudulent campaign. To learn why this scam is so hazardous and how exactly the targeted scam works, read our new blog\npost.\n\n**Personal approach ensured**\n\nJust a couple of years ago — in 2017-2019 — online scams were focused on the mass character: by indiscriminately targeting users,\ncybercriminals tried to ensure that at least someone would take the bite.\n\nLink redirecting user to the targeted link, placed on an adult site\n\nThis idea formed the basis of popular scams with fake giveaways, surveys and reimbursement of non-existent benefits. Over time, fewer and\nfewer people fell prey to such schemes. This made it much more difficult for cybercriminals to make money, which was further exaggerated\nby the frequent blocks of the fraudulent infrastructure. Those events pushed scammers to search for more sophisticated ways of fulfilling\ntheir financial ambitions.\n\nThe mass SMS sending, and the waves of messages in messengers and emails were replaced by the so-called personal approach. Now,\nthreat actors generate a unique targeted link customized for their victim, which utilizes the potential victim's unique parameters (country,\ntime zone, language, IP, browser, and etc.) to display the relevant content on the scam page.\n\nThe targeted link most frequently leads to the website with the notorious surveys, which, however, now are tailored for the user. Even if a\nuser suspects anything wrong in time, the targeted link cannot be blocked, as it's customized. Scammers create a targeted link customized\nfor a specific user so that it doesn't display any content to those who attempt to follow it without specific cookies. But first things first, let's\ncheck how the fraudulent scheme works, what risks it entails and how one can protect against it.\nTargeted links: how do they work?\n\nWe once received a request from one of our customers to analyze a fraudulent link. The customer informed us that they were not able to\nopen the link and see the content. We examined the link and found out that scammers exploited over a hundred brands.\n\nIn Singapore, visitors to the thepiratebay.cc torrent tracker received a personal link leading to the fake site allegedly belonging to a\nSingaporean mobile network operator (traffic: 13,500 people per day)\n\nJudging from Group-IB DRP team's experience, this is quite a common case; this kind of content does not live long. Nevertheless, the\nresource was sent for analysis. It turned out that the problem was much deeper, and the mechanism to create targeted links had\nconsiderably changed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The scheme illustrating how targeted links work_\n\nThe analysis showed that the scammers used all the available tools to distribute the malicious link: contextual advertising, advertising on\nlegal and completely illegal sites, SMS, mailouts, and buying domains that sound like the original ones. Adding links to the calendar and\nposts on social networks, which were trendy at that time, were less common. The mail outs and SMS almost always contained a short link,\nwhich had information about a customer motivation program, where the user could win an expensive device.\n\nNext, the scammers resorted to the so-called traffic cloaking. This is a popular way of distributing traffic, where one user sees legitimate\ncontent and the other semi-legitimate or illegal content depending on the redirection conditions (IP, language, device). Legitimate content is\ncompletely unremarkable and does not pose any threat. It does not raise any questions from advertisers or providers. Semi-legitimate and\nillegal content, on the other hand, violate advertising distribution rules and pose a great threat to users, especially the inattentive ones.\n\n**Cloaking is prohibited by all ad networks, but the scamming is often not immediately recognized, even with the help of special software.**\nAdvertising can \"live\" on the site for a very long time. In addition, this type of fraud is spread by more than one person and not even one\ngroup of people. This is a massive network. When part of the fraudulent accounts that spread illegal traffic is blocked, new ones instantly\nappear; this is one of the reasons why this scheme is very difficult to eliminate.\n\nWhen following the link, the user was sent into a chain of redirections, after which they received something like this:\n\nhttps://y****s.site/s10xs/***/?\n\nosv=Windows%2010.0&isp=G***S%20T***m&ip=***.***.***.111&key=eyJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIxNTU0Mzg4MjYzIiwiaGFzaCI6IjIwZGQwM2I2Y2\nUxMDI1NzJhZWY1NDM0MTZhNzZjODY2ZjIyYzZmZDgifQ%3D%3D&td=7ktpj.b***k.com&bemobdata=c%3D227bad15-b386-42e0-911b\n674575ed6cd8..a%3D0..b%3D0..e%3D1554388262666418..c1%3D9627..c2%3D9254..c3%3D1554388262666418..r%3Dhttps%253A%252F\n%252F***t.ru%252Fgoto%252F9254%252F44db6ebf9c%252F#\n\n01\n\nAfter a while, the links began to change their form, removing the referrer (the site from which the user came), making the link less informative\nfor analysis:\n\nhttps://ca****k/pr/i12/brand/m***o/\n\n?osv=Windows%2010.0&isp=Chrome&tid=1aa56077-f400-4910-92c6\nbb249266438d&key=eyJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIxNjA3OTQzODExIiwiaGFzaCI6IjUzZGExNmE3YWU5NzJmMTEyMTMyMDc2YzZiOGMyNTU4NDdl\nNDI3YjUifQ%3D%3D&td=t.w***k.click&bemobdata=c%3Df84cec94-089f-4dbd-8b13-2f9ddea20bb4..a%3D0..b%3D1#\n\n02\n\nNow the URLs have become short, which makes it very difficult to analyze and respond to these violations, because when you receive this\nkind of link, it becomes very difficult and sometimes impossible to reach the regulator with explanations.\n\nhttps://e*** click/cz/i12/brand/m***l/\n\n\n-----\n\n03\n\nThe next problem in eliminating this type of fraud is the modus operandi of the link the user follows.\n\nWhen a user clicks on a banner, contextual ad, a malicious link from an email, or even an SMS, they are not immediately redirected to a\nstatic site. Firstly, the user is redirected many times, with data being collected from them each time: geolocation, language, browser, provider\nname.\n\nBased on this information, a final fraudulent link is automatically generated; this includes a timestamp — the information about the date and\ntime. This specific link is unique and will work only once and only for a specific user.\nWhen eliminating such schemes, a specialist usually faces the following difficulties:\n\nsuch links are very difficult to detect\n\nthe scam is very difficult to respond to promptly\n\nthe time of resource operation is significant\n\nThe most interesting part is the content on the fake website. It can be absolutely different, and the scammer may attempt to exploit random\nbrands or the brand the victim frequently uses.\n\nOn these sites, surveys are conducted, allegedly on behalf of a large company. Very often scammers promise a large prize for completing the\npoll. But after completing this survey, the user will be asked to fill out a form with their personal data in order to receive the prize. As a rule,\nthe system requires the user to provide the following information:\n\nScammers may use different templates for the phishing sites:\n\nUsing this data, the attackers can easily make online purchases on your behalf, sell this data on the black market, or create accounts\nanywhere on the Internet, using your personal data.\n\nThe scammers can also immediately ask the user to transfer an amount of money. For example, as a test payment or tax, which is allegedly\nimposed on the prizes.\n\nIt should be noted that besides phishing, the link can pose other threats. There are also other options for monetization such as malware,\ndirect debiting of funds, or the purchase of subscriptions using your personal data.\n\nExamining the targeted link: what's inside?\n\nThe structure of a targeted URL varies to a certain extent, but can be divided into several parts.\n\nThe first part redirects the user to a directory on a website, which stores material selected for particular users based on information available\nabout them: country, location, brand, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The structure of a targeted link_\n\nExamples of URLs with different directories:\n\n1\n\nhttps://f****n.click/***/122/1/33/?\n\ntrack=go.l***b.click&key=eyJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIxNjI2MDkxMzE4IiwiaGFzaCI6IjRjNjdmMWVhZjYwNzc\n\n0NTA5ODNjNmVlMDgxYmQxM2E2YWU5NWNhZjAifQ%3D%3D&bemobdata=c%3D448f750d-40b8\n49d1-8426-e09bef4d3f38..l%3D54032268-0e90-420a-b4f2\nbffd0954d0ae..a%3D0..b%3D0..r%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F#\n\n2\n\nhttps://s***r.click/kr/i12/****/a***n/?\n\nts=08e29a07-b84a-41cf-a9c0-1cb114072fbc&camp=&zone=&landid=22b8a4d3-9ef6-496e-bf40-a48c\n\n5e1fff2d&osv=Windows%2010.0&isp=G***S%20T***m&tid=08e29a07-b84a-41cf-a9c0\n1cb114072fbc&key=eyJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIxNjI2MDk2MTUwIiwiaGFzaCI6IjJhNjllZWU1YmI1ZjViZTJiODgw\n\nODJmMDA4NDk3YjRjMGQwODE3M2MifQ%3D%3D&td=t.w***k.click&bemobdata=c%3D9265ab6c\nbff5-4bf2-85fc-7bc1dbb4daa9..l%3D22b8a4d3-9ef6-496e-bf40-a48c5e1fff2d..a%3D0..b%3D1#\n\nMoreover, the link may contain:\n\n1\n\nthe user's provider\n\n2\n\nOS version\n\n3\n\na key consisting of two variables (to be described in detail later in the text)\n\n3\n\na type of website to which the user is redirected (the name of the directory to which the user is redirected)\n\n**Track: most often, this is the domain of the initial smartlink, and it is the starting point for cloaking. Usually, it is a legal platform.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThen comes the base64 encoded key. It contains a timestamp and a hash. These parameters are used to identify each specific user and\nlabel them as unique.\n\nExamples of links with a different hash:\n\n1\n\nhttps://l***v.click/it/s20i11/w***d/?\nosv=Windows%2010.0&isp=G***S%20T***m&tid=1aa56077-f400-4910-92c6bb249266438d&key=eyJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIxNjA4MTA2MDg3IiwiaGFzaCI6IjdiNGY3YmJkMzhkMzVkMDg4ODd\njYzdlMWY2Mzk5NWZjZGNlZmQxMzEifQ%3D%3D&td=t.w***k.click&bemobdata=c%3D23150be1-e4444aa1-b631-33e989cb3f2d..a%3D0..b%3D0#\n\nkey = {\"timestamp\":\"1608106087\",\"hash\":\"7b4f7bbd38d35d08887cc7e1f63995fcdcefd131\"} - base64 encode\n2\n\nhttps://n****n[.]click/au/20/1/2/?\ntrack=go.lltrsknoob.click&key=eyJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiOiIxNjI2MDkwNTk2IiwiaGFzaCI6IjJhYjY5ZmU2ZDU0ZjE0MG\nJmYzI3YjMyN2I1NzdlMTdhYWFlMjc1MDUifQ%3D%3D&bemobdata=c%3Dbecb4768-3b61-47b9-8dd8a6633197096b..l%3D2b5bb6f7-cd86-49e5-afb6013d10a5ea16..a%3D0..b%3D0..r%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F#\n\nThe last element in the URL is the blob link, which is added to further analyze the effectiveness of the traffic attracted.\n\nTargeted link infrastructure: domain networks\n\nWe found at least 60 different domain name networks that generate targeted links. On average, each of them contains over 70 domain\n**names.**\n\nThe largest detected network in terms of the number of domain names includes 232 domain names. It is possible that not all the sites are\ncurrently active. Such a large number of domains is created to make it possible to redirect the traffic to a related resource as soon as\npossible if an active one is blocked. This way, the fraudsters ensure continuous operation of their scamming scheme.\n\nVery often, a large number of domain names on the network does not mean that this network is the most visited.\n\nThe next screen shows a network of resources that contains 51 domain names with targeted links. This is one of the largest networks in\nterms of traffic found by Group-IB experts.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe average number of users following targeted links located on the finalopnon.click domain is about 4,640 people per day. We can conclude\nthat scammers are actively attracting traffic here and making sure that the operation does not stop due when the site is blocked.\n\nThe domain names of this network are visited by 330,993 people per day (on average, 6,620 people visit each domain name). Almost 10\n**million people can fall victim to the scamming scheme per month on the abovementioned network alone.**\nScam's scale: geography and victims\n\nLike many successful large-scale Internet scams, targeted fraud first appeared in Russia, but over time spread all over the world. Today, this\ntype of fraud has been spotted in more than 90 countries, with cybercriminals exploiting more than 120 brands as bait.\n\nCriminals mostly try to exploit the brands of leading telecommunications companies, which enjoy special \"love\" in this scheme, and make up\nmore than 50% of the total number of brands exploited.\n\nThe number of potential victims is huge, since on average, more than 5,000 people per day visit these websites. Group-IB experts estimate\nthe damage at $80 million per month*. In addition, users lose personal data and risk infecting their devices with malware.\n\nAnalyzing the server infrastructure, which hosted these websites, we found out numerous targeted link templates sorted by country. Each\ntemplate is stored in a special directory related to a country. One brand could be used many times, with the language being changed based\non the country. Thus, we managed to evaluate the geographical scope of the Target Scam.\n\nFor each specific website with fraudulent content, traffic source information was collected and sorted by country. Based on this division, the\nmain sources of traffic for such resources are India (42.2%), Thailand (7%), and Indonesia (4.4%), among others. Based on the pattern\nidentified, the target regions for the scamming scheme are: Europe (36.3%), Africa (24.2%), and Asia (23.1%).\n\n- The calculation formula was as follows: the number of sites * the site's minimum conversion * an average money loss on a phishing\nwebsite.\n\n\n-----\n\nEach country was taken into account only once.\n\nIn general, the geography and number of brands used in this scamming scheme are incredibly broad. Among the companies, there are many\nwell-known global brands; the list contains at least half of all the world's countries.\n\nFor each country there is at least one template and on average, at least three well-known brands are used.\n\nSometimes brands are used more than once, and of course, the language of the template also changes; overall, there are more than 120\nunique brands involved in the scheme.\n\nThe most common fraud template is a promise to give away a MacBook, Sony PlayStation 5, iPad Pro or the latest smartphones from Apple\nand Samsung in return for the user's participation in a survey.\n\nAnd even job offers:\n\nThere's also a scam requesting that users download a fake VPN upgrade and offering an app as bait, and so on:\n\nEliminating a vulnerability:\n\nAnd just a free VPN:\n\n\n-----\n\nRisks\n\nTargeted fraud carries risks not only for users, but also for the brands that the scammers abuse. Companies incur both reputational and\nfinancial losses; if a user loses money because of a brand, then they are likely to abandon it.\n\nThere are also many unpredictable risks. For example, accounts are stolen on the site on an enormous scale, and then money is laundered\nthrough these accounts.\n\nIf it comes to litigation, the company can receive a severe blow to its reputation, along with a fine from the regulatory authorities.\n\nWhen buying or selling bad traffic, ad networks risk their reputation, customers, and money. Such behavior usually entails financial loss.\nRecommendations for users\n\nDo not send money to anyone for a \"prize\". Companies that organize these competitions do not use this practice.\n\nAlways pay attention to the domain name of the site.\n\nDo not trust promotions with a quick countdown timer, as in most cases these promotions are fraudulent.\n\nOnly enter your bank card details on trusted sites.\n\nDo not open links sent to you, even if they come from a good friend or a relative, as their account could be compromised.\n\nUse a special virtual card for online shopping and set a limit for this card.\n\nRecommendations for rights holders\n\nCarefully process user messages and implement a system that will process all incidents related to the security of the company and its users.\n\nTrack messages from users outside the company. This will not only help your security service, but also your PR and marketing departments.\n\nConduct independent monitoring not only for phishing, but for all threat vectors, which may come from unexpected sources.\n\nHire DRP vendors whose experience and technologies make it possible to detect and block not only fraudulent sites, but the entire\ninfrastructure of attackers. This method allows you to quickly eliminate violations on all Internet resources involved in the scheme, as well as\nto monitor the emergence of domain names that might host illegitimate content.\n\n\n-----",
