    "plain_text": "# Nefilim Ransomware Threatens to Expose Stolen Data\n\n**[trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/nefilim-ransomware-threatens-to-expose-stolen-data](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/nefilim-ransomware-threatens-to-expose-stolen-data)**\n\nA new [ransomware named Nefilim has been discovered, threatening to release its victims’ data to](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/Ransomware)\n\nthe public if they fail to pay the ransom. It is most likely distributed through exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), as shared by\nSentinelLabs’ [Vitali Krimez and ID Ransomware's Michael Gillespie via](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel) [Bleeping Computer.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-nefilim-ransomware-threatens-to-release-victims-data/)\n\nNefilim’s code shares many notable similarities with Nemty 2.5 ransomware; the main difference is the fact that Nefilim has done away with\nthe Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) component. It also manages payments via email communication rather than through a Tor payment\nsite. There is nothing that indicates that the same threat actors are behind Nemty and Netfilim. The new ransomware is most likely spread\n[through RDP, like other ransomware such as Nemty,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/nemty-ransomware-possibly-spreads-through-exposed-remote-desktop-connections) [Crysis, and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/brute-force-rdp-attacks-plant-crysis-ransomware/) [SAMSAM.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/server-side-ransomware-samsam-hits-healthcare-industry?_ga=2.131051335.912668769.1538632555-1235046556.1538632555)\n\nNetfilim uses AES-128 encryption to encrypt victim’s files. An RSA-2048 embedded in the ransomware executable will then encrypt the AES\nencryption key. The encrypted AES key will then be added to every encrypted key. The ransomware also adds a “NEFILIM” string as a file\nmarker to all encrypted files. The encrypted files will have .NEFILIM appended to their file names (for example, a file called 1.doc would be\nnamed 1.doc.NEFILIM).\n\nTo decrypt these files, victims need to get the RSA private key from the ransomware developers. Details of the ransom have not been\nreleased yet.\n\n## Race against ransomware\n\nRansomware continues to expand its reach as threat actors continue to come up with new ransomware variants and families. The\nhealthcare, government, and education sectors were on the receiving end of many such attacks last year, as revealed in the Trend Micro\n2019 Annual Security Roundup. Unfortunately, many feel pressured to pay the ransom to prevent the paralysis of operations and the loss of\nvaluable data.\n\nLike Nefilim, many of these ransomware attacks abuse exposed RDP ports. Enterprises can take the following steps to defend against RDP\nabuse:\n\nClose unused RDP ports. If closing them is not possible, limit the source addresses that can access the ports.\nConfigure settings to ensure that only authorized users can gain RDP network admin access.\nMonitor the network to spot signs of attacks.\nLimit the number of failed login attempts to keep unauthorized logins at bay.\n\n[Read: [InfoSec Guide: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)]](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/infosec-guide-remote-desktop-protocol-rdp)\n\nCompanies should also establish firm protocols and rules in dealing with unverified emails; employees should avoid opening these emails or\nattachments. To prevent data loss, employees should also regularly backup files. Finally, regularly updating software and applications can\nensure that the system is protected against both old and recent vulnerabilities.\n\nEnterprises can also further improve security against ransomware through the combination of behavioral analysis and high-fidelity machine\nlearning across email, endpoints, servers, and networks.\n\n[Enterprises that are dealing with a ransomware attack can try the Trend Micro Ransomware File Decryptor (available in Windows and](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1114221)\n[macOS) for free.](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1117628-downloading-and-using-trend-micro-ransomware-decryptor-for-macos)\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA-256** **Trend Micro Pattern**\n**Detection**\n\n\n**Trend Micro Machine Learning**\n**Detection**\n\n\n5ab834f599c6ad35fcd0a168d93c52c399c6de7d1c20f33e25cb1fdb25aec9c6 Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.B Troj.Win32.TRX.XXPE50FFF034\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
