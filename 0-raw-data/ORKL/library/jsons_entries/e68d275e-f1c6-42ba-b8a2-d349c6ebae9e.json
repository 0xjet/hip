Spear phishing messages were sent\nby the actor to China's Ministry of Emergency Management as well as the government of\nWuhan province, where COVID-19 was first identified. While targeting of East Asia is\nconsistent with the [activity we’ve previously reported on APT32, this incident, and other](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/cyber-espionage-apt32)\npublicly reported intrusions, are part of a global increase in cyber espionage related to the\ncrisis, carried out by states desperately seeking solutions and nonpublic information.\n\n**Phishing Emails with Tracking Links Target Chinese Government**\n\nThe first known instance of this campaign was on Jan. 6, 2020, when APT32 sent an email\nwith an embedded tracking link (Figure 1) to China's Ministry of Emergency Management\nusing the sender address lijianxiang1870@163[.]com and the subject 第一期办公设备招标结\n果报告 (translation: Report on the first quarter results of office equipment bids). The\nembedded link contained the victim's email address and code to report back to the actors if\nthe email was opened.\n\n\n-----\n\nPhishing email to China s Ministry of Emergency Management\n\n\nFigure 1: Phishing email to China's Ministry of Emergency Management\nMandiant Threat Intelligence uncovered additional tracking URLs that revealed targets in\nChina's Wuhan government and an email account also associated with the Ministry of\nEmergency Management.\n\nlibjs.inquirerjs[.]com/script/<VICTIM>@wuhan.gov.cn.png\nlibjs.inquirerjs[.]com/script/<VICTIM>@chinasafety.gov.cn.png\nm.topiccore[.]com/script/<VICTIM>@chinasafety.gov.cn.png\nm.topiccore[.]com/script/<VICTIM>@wuhan.gov.cn.png\nlibjs.inquirerjs[.]com/script/<VICTIM>@126.com.png\n\nThe libjs.inquirerjs[.]com domain was used in December as a command and control domain\nfor a METALJACK phishing campaign likely targeting Southeast Asian countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Additional METALJACK Activity Suggests Campaigns Targeting Mandarin Speakers**\n**Interested in COVID-19**\n\nAPT32 likely used COVID-19-themed malicious attachments against Chinese speaking\ntargets. While we have not uncovered the full execution chain, we uncovered a METALJACK\nloader displaying a Chinese-Language titled COVID-19 decoy document while launching its\npayload.\n\nWhen the METALJACK loader, krpt.dll (MD5: d739f10933c11bd6bd9677f91893986c) is\nloaded, the export \"_force_link_krpt\" is likely called. The loader executes one of its\nembedded resources, a COVID-themed RTF file, displaying the content to the victim and\nsaving the document to %TEMP%.\n\nThe decoy document (Figure 2) titled 冠状病毒实时更新：中国正在追踪来自湖北的旅行\n者, MD5: c5b98b77810c5619d20b71791b820529 (Translation: COVID-19 live updates:\nChina is currently tracking all travelers coming from Hubei Province) displays a copy of a\nNew York Times article to the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\nCOVID-themed decoy document\n\n\nFigure 2: COVID-themed decoy document\nThe malware also loads shellcode in an additional resource, MD5:\na4808a329b071a1a37b8d03b1305b0cb, which contains the METALJACK payload. The\nshellcode performs a system survey to collect the victim's computer name and username\nand then appends those values to a URL string using libjs.inquirerjs[.]com. It then attempts to\ncall out to the URL. If the callout is successful, the malware loads the METALJACK payload\ninto memory.\n\nIt then uses vitlescaux[.]com for command and control.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis poses an intense, existential concern to governments, and the current\nair of distrust is amplifying uncertainties, encouraging intelligence collection on a scale that\nrivals armed conflict. National, state or provincial, and local governments, as well as non\n\n-----\n\ngovernment organizations and international organizations, are being targeted, as seen in\n[reports. Medical research has been targeted as well, according to public statements by a](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who-hack-exclusive/exclusive-elite-hackers-target-who-as-coronavirus-cyberattacks-spike-idUSKBN21A3BN)\nDeputy Assistant Director of the FBI. Until this crisis ends, we anticipate related cyber\nespionage will continue to intensify globally.\n\n**Indicators**\n\nType Indicators\n\nDomains m.topiccore[.]com\n\njcdn.jsoid[.]com\n\nlibjs.inquirerjs[.]com\n\nvitlescaux[.]com\n\nEmail Address lijianxiang1870@163[.]com\n\nFiles MD5: d739f10933c11bd6bd9677f91893986c\n\nMETALJACK loader\n\nMD5: a4808a329b071a1a37b8d03b1305b0cb\n\nMETALJACK Payload\n\nMD5: c5b98b77810c5619d20b71791b820529\n\nDecoy Document (Not Malicious)\n\n**Detecting the Techniques**\n\nPlatform Signature Name\n\nEndpoint Security Generic.mg.d739f10933c11bd6\n\nNetwork Security Trojan.Apost.FEC2, Trojan.Apost.FEC3, fe_ml_heuristic\n\nEmail Security Trojan.Apost.FEC2, Trojan.Apost.FEC3, fe_ml_heuristic\n\nHelix\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mandiant Security Validation Actions**\n\nA150-096 - Malicious File Transfer - APT32, METALJACK, Download\nA150-119 - Protected Theater - APT32, METALJACK Execution\nA150-104 - Phishing Email - Malicious Attachment, APT32, Contact Information Lure\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping**\n\nTactic Techniques\n\nInitial Access Spearphishing Attachment (T1193), Spearphising Link (T1192)\n\nExecution Regsvr32 (T1117), User Execution (T1204)\n\nDefense Evasion Regsvr32 (T1117)\n\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\n\nStandard Cryptographic Protocol (T1032), Custom Command and\nControl Protocol (T1094)\n\n\n-----",
