The report cites the earliest known public reference about APT1\ninfrastructure as originating from Symantec. We have detected this threat as\n[Backdoor.Wualess since 2006 and have been actively tracking the group behind these](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-101116-1723-99)\nattacks. The following Q&A briefly outlines some of the relevant Symantec information\naround this group:\n\n**Q: Do Symantec and Norton products protect against threats used by this group?**\n\nYes. Symantec confirms protection for attacks associated with the Comment Crew through\n[our antivirus and IPS signatures, as well as STAR malware protection technologies such as](http://www.symantec.com/page.jsp?id=star)\n[our reputation and behavior-based technologies. Symantec.cloud and](http://www.symantec.com/products-solutions/families/?fid=symantec-cloud) Symantec Mail\nSecurity for Microsoft Exchange also detect the targeted emails used by this group.\n\n**Q: Has Symantec been aware of the activities of the Comment Crew?**\n\nYes. Symantec has been actively tracking the work of the Comment Crew for a period of\ntime to ensure that the best possible protection is in place for the different threats used by\nthis group.\n\n**Q: Why are they called the Comment Crew?**\n\nThey were dubbed the Comment Crew due to their use of HTML comments to hide\ncommunication to the command-and-control servers.\n\n**Q: How does a victim get infected?**\n\nThe initial compromise occurs through a spear phishing email sent to the target. The email\ncontains an attachment using a theme relevant to the target. Some recent examples used\nby this group and blocked by Symantec technologies are listed here:\n\n\n-----\n\nU.S. Stocks Reverse Loss as Consumer Staples, Energy Gain.zip\nInstruction_of_KC-135_share_space.doc\nNew contact sheet of the AN-UYQ-100 contractors.pdf\nU.S. Department of Commerce Preliminarily Determines Chinese and Vietnamese\nIllegally Dumped Wind Towers in the United States.doc\nArmyPlansConferenceOnNewGCVSolicitation.pdf\nChinese Oil Executive Learning From Experience.doc\nMy Eight-year In Bank Of America.pdf\n\n[Similar to what Symantec indicated in a recent blog, if the malicious attachment is opened,](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=73a35ea9-1a0f-4bff-b4b2-1567d7749ec7&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nit attempts to use an exploit against the target victim's system. It drops the malicious\npayload as well as a clean document to keep the ruse going.\n\n**Q: Does Symantec know who this group is targeting?**\n\nYes. Symantec telemetry has identified many different industries being targeted by this\ngroup including Finance, Information Technology, Aerospace, Energy, Telecommunications,\nManufacturing, Transportation, Media, and Public Services. The following Figure shows a\nworldwide heatmap for detections related to this group since the beginning of 2012.\n\n**_Figure. Heatmap of Comment Crew related detections_**\n\n**Q: Currently, what are the most prevalent threats being used by this group?**\n\nSymantec, in the last year, has identified the most prevalent threats being used by this\ngroup as [Trojan.Ecltys,](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-092623-0729-99) [Backdoor.Barkiofork, and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-042403-0432-99) [Trojan.Downbot.](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-052413-1248-99&tabid=2)\n\n**Q: Has Symantec released any publications around these attacks?**\n\nYes. We have recently released publications to address techniques and targets of\n[Trojan.Ecltys and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-092623-0729-99) [Backdoor.Barkiofork, both of which are threats used by this group:](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-042403-0432-99)\n\nWe have also investigated associated attacks of this group:\n\n[The Truth Behind the Shady RAT](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/truth-behind-shady-rat)\n\n**Q: What are the Symantec detection family names for threats used by this group?**\n\nSymantec also detects numerous other files used by this group under various detection\nnames:\n\n**Q: Does Symantec have IPS protection for these threat families?**\n\nYes There are several IPS signatures to catch threat families associated with this group:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Q: How will this report affect the Comment Crew operations?**\n\nDespite the exposure of the Comment Crew, Symantec believes they will continue their\nactivities. We will continue to monitor activities and provide protection against these attacks.\nWe advise customers to use the latest Symantec technologies and incorporate layered\ndefenses to best protect against attacks by groups like the Comment Crew.\n\n\n-----",
