    "plain_text": "## 01 November 2021 The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential\n\n_use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. This data is provided to help_\n_cyber security professionals and system administrators guard against the persistent malicious actions_\n\nPIN Number _of cyber actors. This PIN was coordinated with DHS/CISA._\n\n_This PIN has been released TLP:WHITE_\n\n### 20211101-001\n\n\n## Please contact the FBI with any questions related to this Private Industry\n Notification via your local FBI Field Office.\n\n# Ransomware Actors Use Significant Financial Events and Stock Valuation to Facilitate Targeting and Extortion of Victims\n\n## Summary\n\nThe FBI assesses ransomware actors are very likely using significant financial events, such as\nmergers and acquisitions, to target and leverage victim companies for ransomware infections.\nPrior to an attack, ransomware actors research publicly available information, such as a victim’s\nstock valuation, as well as material nonpublic information. If victims do not pay a ransom\nquickly, ransomware actors will threaten to disclose this information publicly, causing potential\ninvestor backlash.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat\n\nRansomware actors are targeting companies involved in significant, time-sensitive financial\nevents to incentivize ransom payment by these victims. Ransomware is often a two-stage\nprocess beginning with an initial intrusion through a trojan malware, which allows an access\nbroker to perform reconnaissance and determine how to best monetize the access. However,\nwhile this malware is often mass distributed, most victims of trojans are not also victims of\nransomware, indicating ransomware targets are often carefully selected from a pool based on\ninformation gleaned from the initial reconnaissance. During the initial reconnaissance phase,\ncyber criminals identify non-publicly available information, which they threaten to release or\nuse as leverage during the extortion to entice victims to comply with ransom demands.\nImpending events that could affect a victim’s stock value, such as announcements, mergers,\nand acquisitions, encourage ransomware actors to target a network or adjust their timeline for\nextortion where access is established.\n\n  - In early 2020, a ransomware actor using the moniker “Unknown” made a post on the\n\nRussian hacking forum “Exploit” that encouraged using the NASDAQ stock exchange to\ninfluence the extortion process. Following this posting, unidentified ransomware actors\nnegotiating a payment with a victim during a March 2020 ransomware event stated,\n“We have also noticed that you have stocks. If you will not engage us for negotiation we\nwill leak your data to the nasdaq and we will see what's gonna (sic) happen with your\nstocks.”\n\n  - Between March and July 2020, at least three publicly traded US companies actively\n\ninvolved in mergers and acquisitions were victims of ransomware during their respective\nnegotiations. Of the three pending mergers, two of the three were under private\nnegotiations.\n\n  - A November 2020 technical analysis of Pyxie RAT, a remote access trojan that often\n\nprecedes Defray777/RansomEXX ransomware infections, identified several keyword\nsearches on a victim’s network indicating an interest in the victim’s current and near\nfuture stock share price. These keywords included 10-q[1], 10-sb[2], n-csr[3], nasdaq,\nmarketwired, and newswire.\n\n1 10-Q is a quarterly report that must be submitted by all publicly traded companies disclosing relevant\ninformation regarding finances.\n2 10-SB was a filing form used to register the securities of small businesses who wished to trade on U.S. exchanges.\n3 N-CSR is a form that registered management investment companies must file with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission within 10 days after a company disseminates annual and semi-annual reports to stockholders.\n\n\n-----\n\n  - In April 2021, Darkside ransomware[4] actors posted a message on their blog site to show\n\ntheir interest in impacting a victim’s share price. The message stated, “Now our team\nand partners encrypt many companies that are trading on NASDAQ and other stock\nexchanges. If the company refuses to pay, we are ready to provide information before\nthe publication, so that it would be possible to earn in the reduction price of shares.\nWrite to us in ‘Contact Us’ and we will provide you with detailed information.”\n\nThe FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom emboldens\nadversaries to target additional organizations, encourages other criminal actors to engage in\nthe distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does\nnot guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI understands that when\nbusinesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect\ntheir shareholders, employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization\nhave decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local\nFBI field office. Doing so provides the FBI with the critical information they need to prevent\nfuture attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable\nunder US law.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n  - Back-up critical data offline.\n\n  - Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive or storage\n\ndevice.\n\n  - Secure your back-ups and ensure data is not accessible for modification or deletion from\n\nthe system where the original data resides.\n\n  - Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts.\n\n  - Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks.\n\n  - Use two-factor authentication for user login credentials, use authenticator apps rather\n\nthan email as actors may be in control of victim email accounts and do not click on\nunsolicited attachments or links in emails.\n\n  - Implement least privilege for file, directory, and network share permissions.\n\n4 Darkside is a ransomware-as-a-service variant, in which criminal affiliates conduct the attacks and the proceeds\nare shared with the ransomware developer(s). Darkside ransomware was used in the May 2021 Colonial Pipeline\nintrusion.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Review the following additional resources.\n\n`o` The joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom,\n\nand the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating\nMalicious Activity provides additional guidance when hunting or investigating a\nnetwork and common mistakes to avoid in incident handling.\n`o` The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information\n\nSharing & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best\npractices and ways to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack.\n`o` StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop location for\n\nresources to tackle ransomware more effectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Reporting Notice\n\nThe FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or\n\ncriminal activity to their local FBI field office.
