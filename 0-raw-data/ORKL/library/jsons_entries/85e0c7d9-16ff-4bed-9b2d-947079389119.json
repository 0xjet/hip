It’s an important step to move from a reactive\n\na variety of sources, giving the team a chance to\nthink about which sources they have and are most\n\nintelligence team supporting ongoing investigations\nand incidents to a proactive one that helps senior\nleaders in their organization prevent threats,\n\nimportant in their work, and which new sources may\nneed to be acquired or built. It also often involves\ncross-functional insight from other teams, such\n\nunderstand the risks their organization is already\nfacing, and plan strategically for the future.\n\nas the security operations center (SOC), incident\nresponders, senior leaders, business unit and\nsales managers, and individual contributors with\n\nNone of us have a crystal ball, but the very act of\nformalizing threat predictions carries with it benefits\nbeyond identifying potential threats that might\n\ngeopolitical and other analytic skills, building ties to\nthe rest of the organization.\n\ncome to fruition. It forces the team to think carefully\nabout one’s own organization and what resources\nand operations are most important to it; the team\nshould notice trends in common factors among their\npredictions, possibly identifying ways to achieve\npositive security outcomes that cut across identified\nthreats. It offers an opportunity for creativity that\nsome team members may excel at, giving managers\nan opportunity to benefit from a professionally diverse\nteam and giving team members a different way to\ncontribute than more detail-oriented technical work. It\nkeeps the team cognizant of nontechnical factors that\ncould contribute to cyber risk, such as the geopolitical\nposition of the company, macroeconomic and\nsecurity trends, and changes to the organization’s\npublic profile over time.\n\nAs former US President Dwight\nD. Eisenhower once said about\nhis life in the Army, “Plans are\nworthless, but planning\nis everything.”\nEven if none of your team’s particular predictions\ncome to fruition, the very act of gathering sources,\nteaming up, formalizing predictions, and tracking\nthem throughout the following year can greatly\nimprove efficacy, develop your organization’s threat\nintelligence talent, keep the team mindful of potential\nblind spots, and ensure accountability.

Eisenhower once said about his\n\n4\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Letter from the editor, cont’d.)\nlife in the Army, “Plans are worthless, but planning\nis everything.”\nIt is in that spirit that we want to share a few of the\nintelligence-based predictions regarding threats to\ncloud systems the Google Cybersecurity Action Team\n(GCAT) came up with during their brainstorm, which we\nwill be tracking over the next year or more as we head\ninto 2023:\n•\n\n•\n\nIdentity and trust relationships in and between\ncloud environments will continue to get more\ncomplex, challenging visibility and enabling\nthreat actors to have a wider and deeper impact\non organizations. We anticipate an increase in\ntargeting of identities that allow cross-platform\nauthentication as threat actors recognize the value\nin compromising identities rather than endpoints.\nThe Chinese Government group APT10’s Cloud\nHopper campaign (see page 14) which pivoted\nfrom MSP access to exploitation of VPN technology\nand, more recently, the Russian Government group\nAPT29’s compromises of Microsoft 365 and similar\ncloud-hosted workplaces provide a template they\nand less sophisticated groups will follow. In 2023,\nwe will be watching to see if there is at least one\npublic incident of a threat actor gaining access to a\ncustomer environment at one Cloud Service Provider\n(CSP) and leveraging that into assets hosted on a\ndifferent CSP due to a lack of identity verification\ncontrols, overly permissive trust architecture,\nor both.\nThreat actor use of one-off cloud-hosted instances\nwill become increasingly harmful as threat actors\ngenerate more effective and potent uses of shortterm tenancy. The top malware used by short-term\ninfections will still be cryptominers in 2023, but\nother forms of monetization, such as phishing or\n\nransoming customer environments, could grow\nas well.\n•\n\nAs cloud customer environments expand, thirdparty assets–software libraries, external data\nfeeds, third-party tools, and so on–are being\nintegrated within these environments. Given\nthe cloud’s extended automation capabilities\ncompared to on-premises settings, users can\ntherefore benefit from such new capabilities\nfaster. At the same time, such assets may be\nintegrated faster than security teams can assess\nthe risk to them, necessitating updates to riskmanagement processes–potentially with their\nown automation–to keep up. The risk of thirdparty dependencies will be an important issue\nin 2023. Given the high-profile success of public\nincidents like the one that affected SolarWinds,\nwe predict at least one APT actor will use\nseemingly legitimate software updates to push\nmalware to third-party systems in 2023, after\nhaving compromised a software provider.\n\n•\n\nOrganizations have increasingly integrated\nOT systems with IT infrastructure, including\nthe use of cloud services, to scale production,\ndevelop efficiencies, and handle geographically\ndistributed processes for critical infrastructure.\nThreat groups with experience targeting\nphysical production networks are likely already\nplanning how to compromise targets using cloud\nservices. In 2023, we will likely see increasing\ndiscussion by threat actors on how to disrupt\ncloud services and resources that support OT\nproduction systems via denial-of-service (DoS)\nattacks–for example, moving across improperly\nsegmented networks, deploying ransomware,\nor even developing customized malware. (See\npage 09.)\n\n5\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Letter from the editor, cont’d.)\n•\n\nAttacker tools and malware are evolving to better\ntarget customer cloud environments specifically. As\nmore companies move more things to the cloud and\nsoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) providers and away\nfrom on-premises, more attacks will inevitably shift\nto target customers’ cloud environments. Cloud\nproviders continue to invest in defending themselves\nand partnering with customers to improve their\ndefenses, but vigilance is needed to keep pace with\nevolving threats. We predict new and upgraded\ncloud-specific attack tools to start appearing in\n2023. Cloud-focused malware will also be updated\nto more efficiently abuse cloud instances. We\npredict a ransomware strain that targets cloudbased backups, including revision history and cloudstored backups in 2023.\n(See page 09.)\n\nChristopher Porter is the Head of Threat Intelligence\nfor Google Cloud.\n\n6\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\nSummary\n\nInitial-access vectors diversify,\npoint toward possible increase in\nautomation of attacks\nCloud Compromise Factors (Q3 2022)\n\nSoftware Targeted in Cloud (Q3 2022)\n\nIn Q3 2022, analysis of data about Google Cloud\ncustomer compromises indicates that threat actors\ndiversified their initial access vectors compared to what\nwe saw earlier in the year. Weak passwords continued\nto be the most common factor at 41% of observed\ncompromises. However, API key compromise played\na role in nearly 20% of cases studied last quarter. In\nterms of which software was most targeted in Q3, we\nobserved significant diversification. SSH was targeted\nin 26% of cases, but Jenkins and PostgreSQL were close\nbehind at around 22% and 17%, respectively.\n\nIncreased diversification efforts by threat actors in\ntargeting and access vectors highlights the constantly\nevolving threat landscape faced by organizations. In\nparticular, the use of API compromise may suggest\nincreased levels of automation by threat actors. While\nthreat activity historically has dropped toward the end\nof Q4, the use of automation may allow actors to keep\nactivity steady or even growing in volume into 2023.\n\nThe following statistics were derived from the portion of compromises observed by our incident response teams, which will be skewed to the platform affected in these cases and may not be\nrepresentative of all customer environments and verticals on Google Cloud.\n1\n\n7\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor\nFormore\nmoreinformation,\ninformation visit gcat.google.com\n\nThreat trends\n\n8\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\nMalware communicating and hiding\ninteractions with cloud providers’ IP\naddresses and open ports\nIssue description\nExamining new attack vectors against cloud\nenvironments, we searched VirusTotal (VT) for 2022\nmalware samples communicating with three geographic\nregions of large cloud service providers (CSPs). We\nfound over 6,000 malware samples–dynamically\nanalyzed by VT–communicating with the CSPs using\nmany pre-specified or at times randomly selected IP\naddresses and TCP/IP ports. The malware also at times\ntried to hide its activities among legitimate services by\ncommunicating to CSPs using well-known ports, as well\nas by explicitly utilizing TLS. Cloud users should mitigate\nthese types of malicious operations by monitoring\nand restricting inbound as well as internal Google\nCloud network communications, using hardened VM\nimages, and reviewing cloud instance audit events for\nunexpected administrative or user activities.\nThe malware samples we identified that communicated\nwith CSPs utilized well-known ports–like 80, 23, and\n443–more frequently compared to registered and\n\nephemeral ports (e.g., above 1023). This may be\nbecause CSPs and their customers more frequently\nopen such ports to expose associated standard\nservices, thereby providing open channels for misuse\nattempts. Malware, however, may target the registered\nor ephemeral ports when scanning for open TCP/IP\nports. Malware may also target such ports to exploit\nvarious less-common cloud services. Malware, of\ncourse, may also simply be exploring if it has an\ninternet connection.\nWe examined Q2-Q3 2022 VT data showing malware\ntrying to contact either cloud services, customercreated workloads hosted by the three largest CSPs\n(Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS), or both. Using\nthe CSPs’ IP addresses representing the Canadian,\nGerman, and South American regions (chosen for\ngeographic diversity and traffic differences, as well\nas the manageable number of malware samples to\nanalyze), we looked at malware first submitted to VT\n\n9\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Malware communicating and hiding, cont’d.)\n\nIllustration 1\n\nover a four-month period, April through July 2022.\nIllustration 1 shows how well-known port numbers\n(below 1024) were targeted more frequently when\ncompared to registered and ephemeral ports (above\n1023) in our sample.\nAdditionally, malware was found attempting to\ncommunicate differently to the same well-known\nports on different CSPs, as each CSP exposes different\n\nservices. For example, port 445 was relatively more\npopular for malware communicating with Azure\nthan for malware communicating with the other\nCSPs. Port 445 is used for SMB communications\nfor managing Windows machines and related filesharing services. Windows-based cloud services\nprobably make up a larger share of workloads on\nMicrosoft-owned Azure than on the other CSPs.\n\n10\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Malware communicating and hiding, cont’d.)\nThreat actors may also be disguising their malware’s\nactivities. We discovered malware that was programmed\nto use well-known ports, otherwise leveraged for\nlegitimate services, to “blend in.”2 Malware authors may\nalso emphasize, or conversely not prioritize, the hiding\nof their malware’s activities when trying to communicate\nwith CSP IP addresses being utilized for malicious\npurposes. Often, when malware communicates with\nmalicious IPs, it tries to protect its interactions from\nscrutiny using TLS. However, one-third of the time,\nother malware communicates with malicious IPs over\nthe unprotected–and more “monitorable”–port 80.\nSuch patterns may reflect the desire of some malware\nauthors to protect communications and let their\nmalware potentially persist, disguised, within cloud\nenvironments. Other authors, however, might be\nfocused on immediate target compromise, rather than\non long-term persistence and associated “detection\nevasion” techniques.3\n•\n\n•\n\nFor example, consider well-known port 443, used\nfor encrypted communications. From July through\nOctober 2022, Google observed some customer\nGoogle Cloud environments compromised by\ncryptominers via Google Cloud APIs. Customers\naccidentally leaked service account credentials\nto public code repos, like GitHub; after which,\nautomated malicious scripts captured such\ncredentials, authenticated to environment-managing\nGoogle Cloud APIs over port 443, and spun up new\nVMs, installing the cryptomining software within\nthem.\nOur data shows that TLS is used to protect\ncommunications in almost half of cases when\n\nmalware is trying to communicate through\ncommon, well-known CSP ports to CSP IPs\nbehind such ports.\n•\n\nThis overall analysis is also supported by other\nstudies. A Sophos Q2 2021 report found that\nmalware communicated with web and cloud\nservices–such as GitHub, and similar cloud\nservices–using TLS almost half the time.4\nAnd this was a 100% increase over 2020,\nwhen only 23% of malware used TLS for\nsuch communications.\n\nMalware attempts to communicate with registered\nand ephemeral ports too. Our data identified two\nlive campaigns contacting the CSPs–one contacting\nall three CSPs via port 2323 and another contacting\nGoogle Cloud via port 15647. The campaign trying to\ncontact the CSPs via port 2323 was targeting IPs that\nthe malware dynamically generated. To understand\nmalware communicating with the CSPs on port 2323,\nwe selected from our dataset a sample of 4 out of 19\nfiles communicating with Azure port 2323, the one file\ncommunicating with Google Cloud port 2323, and a\nsample of 3 out of 15 files communicating with AWS\nport 2323. To understand the malware communicating\nwith Google Cloud port 15647, we examined a sample\nof 4 out of 23 files communicating with this port in our\ndataset. We also examined VT’s large data corpus.\n•\n\nThe campaign contacting the three CSPs via port\n2323 is the Mirai malware. This malware tries to\ncompromise IoT devices to coordinate them for\nbotnet attacks. The malware generates pseudorandom IPv4 addresses–contacting them via port\n2323 to find potential, “compromisable”\n\nAttackers “blending in” by using well-known ports in externally facing on-premises, as well as general internet, environments is supported by other studies too–such as MITRE, “Commonly Used\nPort,” MITRE ATT&CK, September 27, 2022, https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0885/, accessed December 9, 2022.\n3\nNote: It is possible that malware’s common use of TLS and port 80 when communicating with malicious IPs may happen when the IPs represent general websites, rather than just CSP-specific IP\nranges; and one reference, a 2021 Sophos study, describing some of these behaviors, is provided in the article. Nevertheless, we did not investigate the full range of such behaviors in our data.\n4\nJai Vijayan, “Nearly Half of All Malware Is Concealed in TLS-Encrypted Communications,” Dark Reading, April 22, 2021, https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/nearly-half-of-allmalware-is-concealed-in-tls-encrypted-communications-/d/d-id/1340792, accessed November 8, 2022.\n2\n\n11\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Malware communicating and hiding, cont’d.)\nIoT devices (for example, having known default\npasswords).5 Our research suggests that Mirai\nmalware must have incidentally generated IPv4\naddresses matching some addresses in the\nAzure, Google Cloud, and AWS public IP\nranges, and the malware was exploring potential\nIoT communicability.\n•\n\nThe campaign contacting Google Cloud port\n15647 is the Redline malware. This software steals\ninformation like passwords and saved credit card\ndata from endpoint computers, such as from\nbrowsers, and other local machine information like\nmachine memory size and similar data, and sends\nthis data to a remote C2 server. Our data shows that\nthe few Redline samples targeting Google Cloud\nport 15647 were all targeting the same IP address,\nwhich–per VT’s analysis of the malware samples–\nwas the C2 for this Redline campaign. Redline grew\nin popularity in 2022, and it communicated with\na variety of IPs beyond Google Cloud during its\ncampaign. There were under a hundred Redline\nsubmissions to VT for analysis at the beginning of\n2022, but by the June-September period, there were\nroughly 7,000-8,000 submissions per month.\n\nhelps you understand the effectiveness of your\nfirewall rules by identifying misconfigurations\nand providing metrics that can alert on malicious\nbehavior based on significant changes. In\nparticular, Telnet (port 23) is one of the most\npopular ports targeted (Illustration 1). And since\nTelnet has a number of vulnerabilities, it’s strongly\nrecommended to deny access to Google Cloud\nresources via the port using firewall settings.\nPort 23’s activities should also be monitored\nusing Firewall Insights. Also, consider eventually\nusing Google Cloud Threat Intelligence Objects\n(GCTIO)–a capability of Cloud Firewall Standard,\nwhich is currently in preview, and will be available\nin 2023. GCTIO, among other features, can alert\nor block malicious external IPs and domains\nfrom communicating with your Google Cloud\ninstance, based on the analysis of several threat\nintelligence feeds.\n2.\n\nEnsure that only hardened VM images are used\nwithin Google Cloud instances. For example,\ncheck that operating systems (OSs) are kept\nappropriately patched, unneeded OS services are\nturned off, and any default OS service account\ncredentials have been changed. We strongly\nrecommend using Google Cloud’s Shielded VMs,\nwhich are VMs hardened by a set of security\ncontrols to prevent remote attacks, privilege\nescalation, and related security threats.\n\n3.\n\nUse VPC Service Controls as part of a defense\nin depth strategy to prevent malicious external\nsources from accessing your cloud resources.\nVPC Service Controls can restrict access to cloud\n\nSuggested mitigations for\nGoogle Cloud customers\n1.\n\n5\n\nUse various Google Cloud Firewall capabilities to\nlimit external access to and create appropriate\nrestrictions within Google Cloud environments.\nConfigure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall\nrules to restrict IP and port communications to\nthe minimum required.

Configuring\ncertain individuals or groups to access specific\napplications via Identity and Access Management\n(IAM) and IAP, and having the applications\nvalidate signed application headers in the HTTP\nrequests to the applications, allows only the\naforementioned identities to get access to\nthe applications.\n7.\n\nUse VirusTotal (VT) to examine if malware is\ncontacting your Google Cloud IP addresses. VT\nwill identify malware samples contacting specific\nIP addresses or ports. It also identifies if particular\ntarget IP addresses are hard coded within the\nmalware samples themselves. Searching in VT for\nmalware communicating with or embedding your\nGoogle Cloud IPs into its code can help lead to\neven more focused IP or port examinations, the\nshutdown of suspect assets, and the throttling of\ncertain communications, if required.\n\nUse appropriate authentication and authorization\ncontrols to restrict access to important Google\nCloud and Google Workspace applications. Turn\non MFA for critical applications and key users, such\nas administrators. Consider using hardware-based\ntokens such as security keys for the second factor\nof authentication.

The group\nhas specialized in targeting cloud infrastructure and,\nbetween the discovery of the Cloud Hopper campaign\nin 2016 and the A41APT campaign of 2020, has evolved\nits techniques from basic cloud account hijacking to the\ntargeting of VPN technologies. This elegant approach\ndeliberately targets those organizations that have yet\nto adopt a full zero trust environment, preferring to use\ntrusted VPN connections in a hybrid or transitioning\ncloud environment. APT10’s ability to leverage both open\nsource and custom tooling to target an organization’s\nunique infrastructure composition make them highly\nadept at identifying the inevitable weak spots of\nhybrid enterprises.\n\nThe Cloud Hopper campaign\nIn 2016, a combined effort by PwC, BAE Systems,\nand the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)\n(with support from other unnamed organizations)\ndiscovered that APT10 had compromised multiple IT\nservice providers who were providing services to the\n\nenterprise networks of various public and private\nsector organizations. The initial attack vectors\nvaried, with the actor often using techniques that\ndo not require significant technical know-how,\nsuch as spear-phishing, and a variety of initialstage implants to establish an initial foothold. From\nthere, the actor would use a series of open source\ntools such as Mimikatz, NBTScan, and TCPing to\nmove laterally through the network and identify\nsystem administrator accounts that had access to\nthe relevant “jump boxes” in their customers’ cloud\nenvironments. This provided extensive access,\nlimited only by the access of the compromised\nadministrators, to the foundational infrastructure of\nany of the original IT service providers’ customers.\nFrom there, the malicious actors would exfiltrate data\neither directly over the host’s cloud infrastructure or\nvia the IT service provider themselves.\nWhen initially identified, reporting included analysis\nfrom both private and public sector researchers and\nvictims, and indicated that activity could have started\nas early as 2014. Due to the nature of underlying\n\n14\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(APT10: Lessons learned, cont’d.)\n\nFigure 1. A means to an end: APT10’s Cloud Hopper campaign compromised several IT service\nproviders to gain access to target cloud environments.\n\ninfrastructure compromise, the likelihood of persistence\nbeing established (for example, by creating cloudspecific service accounts to regain access at a later date)\nwas also high, and subsequent discoveries continued for\nyears to come. In 2018, the United States Department of\nJustice issued an indictment for two Chinese nationals\nbelieved to be behind the attacks. One of the key\ntechnological remediations recommended by the wider\nsecurity community at the time was to increase the use\nof VPNs and similar technologies, which could add an\nextra layer of security to cloud environments; however,\nthis would go on to become a further attack vector for\nunsuspecting targets.\n\nTargeting of VPN clients\nMore recent APT10 attacks have identified targeting of\nVPN capabilities. APT10 used a custom malware loader,\ndubbed Ecipekac by researchers, which hijacked VPN\nsessions by exploiting known vulnerabilities in VPN\nsoftware. The exploit was custom designed to run in\n\nmemory and target specific instances of the Pulse\nConnect Secure VPN software. The loader would be\ndelivered through low-equity tooling, in keeping with\nprevious techniques, though upgrading to the Cobalt\nStrike framework.\nThe targeting of VPN software is especially significant\nfor enterprises that have not yet implemented zero\ntrust environments and so rely on VPN setups and\nrestrictive firewall policies to manage corporate\nnetwork accesses. Such a setup is common in the\ntransition toward cloud, as it provides a convenient\ninterface for security engineers to manage both\ncloud access and wider-enterprise tooling, including\nSaaS, by limiting access to predetermined network\nranges. This, too, provides convenience for the\nattacker who merely needs to compromise the VPN\ninfrastructure, leveraging that trusted infrastructure\nto exploit subsequent targets–including, but not\nlimited to, cloud infrastructure.\n\n15\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(APT10: Lessons learned, cont’d.)\n\nFigure 2. Timeline of the Ecipekac loader files and payloads [image: Kaspersky]\n\nConclusion\nAmong cyberthreat researchers, we often organize\nour research efforts according to different types of\ntechnologies. This allows analysts to focus and become\nexperts on those technologies. The same is true of\nstate-sponsored malicious cyber actors: APT10 may\nwell be one such specialist team that concentrates on\ntechnologies that enable infrastructure access and\ncontrol. Where such a technology is the ultimate goal\nof the attack, such as the Cloud Hopper campaign, we\nobserve APT10 taking a firm lead. But their efforts are\ncontinuous and, arguably, more effective when allowed\nto track the technology developments of their targets\nand establish prepositioning for future attacks–perhaps\neven to enable other actor groups’ operations, handing\noff access from one to support another. Other statesponsored groups are also upskilling on targeting cloud\nenvironments with increasingly refined techniques.\n\n16\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\nThreat groups probably\ndeveloping methods to threaten\noperational technology deployed\nin the cloud\nHistorically, organizations using operational technology\n(OT) to support the production of goods and services\nhave attempted to isolate production networks from\nexternal information technology (IT) services. This\nseparation was meant to ensure the safety of their\npeople, technology, and processes by impeding\nexternal actors from having access to cyber-physical\ninfrastructure and critical data.\nOrganizations have increasingly integrated OT systems\nwith IT infrastructure, including the implementation\nof cloud infrastructure, to scale production, develop\nefficiencies, and handle geographically distributed\nprocesses. Google Cloud’s Mandiant cyber-physical\nthreat intelligence analysts and incident responders\nare not aware of any high-impact cyberattacks against\norganizations that have implemented cloud services to\nsupport OT systems. Nevertheless, Google Cloud does\nassess that threat groups are poised to attempt to\n\ncarry out such attacks on customer deployments\nbased on: our understanding of prior APT operations\ntargeting physical production networks; the rise\nin cloud adoption generally leading adversaries to\ndevelop different methods to reach their targets; and\nthe importance of reliability to operation of physical\nsystems controlled or supervised by OT networks.\n\nDrivers of OT cloud services\nWhile cloud implementations remain more popular\nin corporate environments, organizations involved in\nphysical production are increasingly moving in the\nsame direction. The main use cases for cloud services\nsupporting OT are as follows:\n•\n\nData collection, monitoring, and analytics.\nDevelopment of infrastructure to facilitate largescale data flows and analysis using artificial\nintelligence and machine learning capabilities.\n\n17\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Threat groups, cont’d.)\nApplications include developing data lakes to gather\nand process operational data, tracking large numbers\nof geographically dispersed assets, building disaster\nrecovery and database backups, and measuring enduser operational data.\n•\n\nPredictive maintenance. Third-party cloud\nproviders process data collected from field assets\nto perform large-scale data analytics and deliver\ninsights on production assets. The feedback\nenables users to learn about the asset’s health\nand deliver timely maintenance. To provide an\nexample, Schneider Electric in 2022 described how\npredictive maintenance for circuit breakers can help\norganizations to ensure safety and reliability, and to\navoid the costs of downtime.\n\n•\n\nRemote asset control and operation. Cloudbased solutions sometimes support remote asset\ncontrol applications. This includes both cloud-based\nplatforms to interact with industrial Internet of\nThings (IIoT) devices, and cloud-based supervisory\ncontrol and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that\ncan sometimes control widely dispersed systems\ndistributed across large geographical areas, such\nas pipelines, rails, and energy transmission or\ndistribution devices.\n\n•\n\nCollaborative workspaces. While less common\nin industrial environments, some vendors offer\ncloud-based workspaces for product and code\ndevelopment. These services enable engineers to\ncollaborate on projects and share them internally\nand externally.\n\n18\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Threat groups, cont’d.)\n\nFigure 1. Overview of cloud infrastructure supporting OT.\n\nMethods of probable OT attack\nagainst cloud deployments\nAs of today, there have been no publicly documented\nattacks impacting OT run via cloud services. This is\nnot surprising given the small number of OT incidents\nobserved in the wild and that cloud solutions for OT\nare not yet widely adopted across the industry. Yet in\n2020, Mandiant estimated that 15% of their incident\nresponse investigations involved public cloud assets,\ndemonstrating a shift in both enterprise planning and\nattacker operations against IT networks, which we\nexpect to follow against OT networks.\n•\n\nMandiant’s Red Team has also reproduced remote\nattacks against cyber-physical infrastructure.\nThis was the case of an engagement in which the\n\nred team accessed an endpoint meter control\ninfrastructure for a state-wide smart grid\nenvironment from the internet and turned it off.\nAmong other things, the team accessed a\nhuman machine interface (HMI) portal for meter\ncontrol infrastructure and issued a disconnect\ncommand for a target endpoint meter in the\nsmart grid environment.\nDespite the lack of such documented attacks,\ncloud exposure can make previously isolated\nphysical systems known to attackers, who could\nthen remotely reach critical systems and data\nin production environments where there is no\n\n19\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Threat groups, cont’d.)\nproper segmentation or secure configurations. The\nimplementation of cloud services modifies the attack\nsurface of an organization by creating new paths for\nattackers to gather information or even interact with\nphysical processes.\n•\n\n» In 2019, steel producer Norsk Hydro was\nimpacted by a ransomware attack. This\nresulted in suspended production resulting\nfrom loss of access to process data and\ninventories. While the case was not related\nto cloud services, it illustrates how curtailed\naccess to such data flows can stop the\nproduction of goods and services.\n\nHighly sophisticated actors targeted OT systems\nand infrastructure leveraging intermediary systems,\nwhich are networked IT assets such as computers\nand servers. This was the case in the TRITON attack,\nwhere malicious actors traversed the victim’s IT\nnetwork and deployed a custom attack framework\nto manipulate industrial safety systems at a critical\ninfrastructure facility and inadvertently caused\na process shutdown. When incorporating cloud\nservices to interact with or gain visibility into OT\nassets, these become another intermediary system\nthat an actor can leverage to remotely reach physical\nproduction assets.\n\n•\n\nIn 2022, Mandiant disclosed INCONTROLLER, a set\nof tools that can be leveraged by actors to target a\nrange of industrial controllers from Schneider Electric\nand Omron. However, to deploy these tools, an actor\nrequires remote access to the target’s production\nnetworks or equipment. From an OT perspective,\nan actor may leverage cloud services to reach the\ntarget assets or to gather process information and\ndetermine additional tools they need to build.\n\n•\n\nMandiant has observed actors deleting or limiting\naccess to cloud data for several reasons, such as\ncovering their tracks or harming their victim. Due to\nthe high availability requirements of OT systems–\nwhich often require real-time process data to\nsupport physical processes–loss of access to data\nstored in clouds could mean lost process visibility or\neven halted operations.\n\n» If an asset owner is using cloud services\nto remotely control production systems, it\nis also possible that an interruption of the\nservice may lead to loss of control over such\nassets. This can be prevented by establishing\nmanual and logical redundancy mechanisms.\n•\n\nDuring the last few years, other actors with\nvarying levels of skill and resources have\nused common IT tools and techniques to gain\naccess to and interact with OT systems that\nare exposed on the internet. This illustrates that\norganizations relying on IT or cloud services for\nremote interaction or visibility into OT assets\nand data cannot count on “security through\nobscurity,” and should meticulously establish\nsegmentation and access boundaries to prevent\nexternal actors from finding and interacting with\ntheir assets.\n\n•\n\nOT process data that is stored in infrastructure\nfrom cloud providers can also become a\nnew target for attackers. By attempting to\ncompromise the third-party infrastructure\ninstead of the industrial organization itself, an\nattacker may seek to get access to process data\nfrom multiple customers at a single time. This\nis particularly relevant in the case of OT, where\nactors often perform reconnaissance campaigns\n\n20\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Threat groups, cont’d.)\nto gather information that is necessary to build\ntools and capabilities to target production systems.\n\nMitigations\nAs the adoption of cloud-based solutions to support\nOT production expands, defenders should focus on\nunderstanding how such implementation modifies\ntheir attack surface and on foreseeing potential\nfuture impacts on production. Defenders should\nconcentrate on:\n•\n\nDesign architecture. Segment networks to\nestablish boundaries to monitor and analyze traffic\nin the same way that it would happen in internal\nIT networks. Implement micro-segmentation by\ndividing the cloud services into different blocks\nand workload levels. Ensure that operational data–\noften based on less secure legacy communication\nprotocols previously available only on-premises–\nthat is monitored, stored, or analyzed in cloud\nservices is encapsulated and encrypted before\ntransitioning out of the OT demilitarized zone\n(DMZ). Limit remote connectivity to OT networks\nand assets to only what is necessary for operation.\n\n•\n\nRisk assessment. Understand associated risks\nand legal responsibilities of cloud implementations\ninterfacing with OT assets. Analyze implications\nfor incident response procedures, broader OT\ncybersecurity regulatory requirements, data\nownership and availability, and security standards.\n\n•\n\nRedundancy. Establish redundancy mechanisms to\nmaintain access to process data and asset control\nif communication flows are interrupted due to a\ntechnical failure or an attack against the cloud\nprovider. Establish data backups in case data in the\ncloud is either lost or corrupted.\n\n•\n\nIncident response. Adapt organizational\nprocedures to respond to quicker change\nmanagement processes and train security\npersonnel who understand the nuances of\nboth cloud security and OT. Some examples of\nrelevant knowledge include:\n» A comprehensive understanding of what\ncloud services are critical to maintaining\nlocal control over infrastructure in the event\nof an enterprise-side compromise that\nforces the organization to disconnect OT\nfrom enterprise and cloud networks.\n» Familiarity with fail-safe modes that allow\ncontrol and safety systems to be controlled\nlocally if cloud SCADA systems are disrupted.\n» Familiarity with the specific tooling required\nfor data collection and forensics required\nto interact with OT assets. To support this\nprocess we suggest following Mandiant’s\nDigital Forensics and Incident Response\nFramework for Embedded OT Systems.\n\n21\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\nBackups increasingly targeted\nby threat actors\nMandiant research indicates that threat actors are\nincreasingly targeting backups to inhibit reconstitution\nafter an attack. In addition, targeting and, in some cases,\ncreating backups allows threat actors to engage in\nreconnaissance of affected organizations, to escalate\nprivileges, and to gather intelligence. These actions may\ninclude disabling and deleting backups, deleting virtual\nmachines, disabling security software, and stopping\nprocesses and services that may interfere with file\nencryption. Examples of this type of activity Mandiant\nhas observed include:\n•\n\n•\n\nOff-site backups have also been targeted by threat\nactors in multiple cases:\n•\n\nIn August 2019, the DDS Safe cloud-based backup\nsystem used by hundreds of American dental\noffices to safeguard patients’ medical records\nwas hit with Sodinokibi ransomware. The attackers\nreportedly exploited remote management\nsoftware used by DDS Safe to back up client data,\nresulting in the encryption of hundreds of files that\ncontained patient information.\n\n•\n\nIn November 2020, NetGain Technologies, a cloudhosting provider and MSP, was forced to take\nsome of its data centers offline after falling victim\nto a ransomware attack. Because of the attack,\nsome 200,000 patients’ personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) may have been compromised.\n\nOperators and users of high-profile Conti\nransomware have deployed malware capable of\ndeleting shadow copies, backups, virtual machines\nand snapshots, and evidence of their activity.\n» Criminal actor group FIN12 (Conti-affiliated)\nused living-off-the-land techniques to manually\ndelete volume shadow copies.\n» Forensic evidence and leaked chat logs from\nthe Conti group indicate that threat actors\nsought to identify and prioritize systems such as\ndomain controllers, network-attached storage\nand file servers, virtualized environments, and\nbackups in order to maintain persistence and\nmaximize impact.\n\nNumerous other ransomware families also\ncontain functionality to automatically delete\nvolume shadow copies and stop services related\nto backup solutions, including LockBit, Ryuk,\nand Babuk.\n\n22\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Backups, cont’d.)\n\nMitigation recommendations\n•\n\nHave a cloud-specific backup strategy in place\nthat is tested at least twice annually. This backup\nstrategy should also include configurations and\ntemplates of stored assets, not solely backups of\ndata or machine state.\n\n•\n\nCreate IAM permissions that segment the access\nand roles needed for creation, deletion, and\nchanges to backups, thereby ensuring that account\ncompromises do not create a direct pathway to\nmove to the backups.\n\n•\n\nConsider using technologies such WORM (Write\nOnce Read Many) or the Bucket Lock feature on\nGoogle Cloud to provide immutable and policycompliant backup storage.\n\n•\n\nConsider implementing resilient architecture such\nas multi-region cloud use and backup mirroring to\nreduce risk of data loss or inaccessibility.\n\n•\n\nEncrypt all backups and, as an extra measure, use\ncustomer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) and\nsegregate key access roles, which would prevent\nattackers from being able to read the backups.\n\n23\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\nUse of cloud infrastructure to\nconduct DDoS attacks\nThe low barrier of entry for cloud computing in the\nform of trials or free tiers offered by cloud service\nproviders (CSPs), the ability to instantly create and scale\nresources, and the readily available tooling has unlocked\nnew opportunities for bad actors. The implications of\nthese challenges to customers range from incurring\nadditional cloud usage costs to reputational damage.\nIn Q3 2022, Google’s Trust and Safety team observed\nan increase in outbound layer 7 distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS) abuse on Google Cloud while around\nthe same time period in late Q2 2022 the Google Cloud\nArmor team blocked the world’s largest layer 7 DDoS\nattack from external sources. Attackers have shifted\nfrom relying on compromised computers in residential\nenvironments and a single tactic to leveraging cloud\nresources in data centers and combining tactics to\nachieve their goals.\nIn Q3 2022, Trust and Safety systems flagged free tier\nor trial accounts abusing Google Cloud resources\nby conducting outbound DDoS attacks. During this\nperiod, we observed the attackers creating costoptimized Compute Engine instances. Within two hours\nof creation, 50% of these flagged projects triggered\n\nDDoS alerts. And within four hours, 87% triggered\nalerts. This suggested that attackers were creating\ninstances for this purpose and launching attacks the\nsame day. Upon triggering an alert, our systems will\nnotify the project owner, giving them an opportunity\nto investigate and resolve the alert–after which, if\nno action is taken, the instance will be shut down.\nFurthermore, our systems are continually updated to\nadapt to the latest DDoS attacks observed.\n•\n\n•\n\nThroughout 2022, attackers attempting to\nevade volumetric traffic detection have been\nobserved tunneling their DDoS traffic through\nopen proxies hosted across the internet, including\ncloud providers. Attackers scan for open proxies,\ncompile a list of available servers, and focus their\ntraffic on their intended targets.\nDuring one of these attacks, Google observed\nmalicious actors gaining access to a customer’s\nproxy servers intended for their business\ncustomers. Due to the scaling abilities of the cloud,\nthe customer’s load balancer autoscaled and spun\nup additional instances of the services that were\nalso used in a DDoS attack, further exacerbating\n\n24\n\nThreat Horizons\nFor more information, visit gcat.google.com\n\n(Use of cloud infrastructure, cont’d.)\nthe situation.
