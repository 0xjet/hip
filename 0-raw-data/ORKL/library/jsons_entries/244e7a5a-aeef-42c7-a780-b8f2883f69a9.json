Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\n\n- Enforce multifactor authentication.\n\n- Secure and monitor Remote Desktop Protocol and other risky services.\n\n- Provide end-user awareness and training.\n\n[The cybersecurity authorities of the United States[1][2][3], Australia[4], Canada[5], New](https://www.cisa.gov/)\n[Zealand[6], and the United Kingdom[7][8] are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory](https://www.ncsc.govt.nz/)\n(CSA). The intent of this joint CSA is to warn organizations that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\ncould expose organizations both within and beyond the region to increased malicious cyber\nactivity. This activity may occur as a response to the unprecedented economic costs\nimposed on Russia as well as materiel support provided by the United States and U.S. allies\nand partners.\n\nEvolving intelligence indicates that the Russian government is exploring options for potential\n[cyberattacks (see the March 21, 2022, Statement by U.S. President Biden for more](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/21/statement-by-president-biden-on-our-nations-cybersecurity/)\ninformation). Recent Russian state-sponsored cyber operations have included distributed\ndenial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and older operations have included deployment of\ndestructive malware against Ukrainian government and critical infrastructure organizations.\n\nAdditionally, some cybercrime groups have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian\ngovernment. These Russian-aligned cybercrime groups have threatened to conduct cyber\noperations in retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government or\nthe Russian people. Some groups have also threatened to conduct cyber operations against\ncountries and organizations providing materiel support to Ukraine. Other cybercrime groups\nhave recently conducted disruptive attacks against Ukrainian websites, likely in support of\nthe Russian military offensive.\n\nThis advisory updates joint CSA Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored\nCyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure, which provides an overview of Russian statesponsored cyber operations and commonly observed tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs). This CSA—coauthored by U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber\nauthorities with contributions from industry members of the Joint Cyber Defense\nCollaborative (JCDC)—provides an overview of Russian state-sponsored advanced\n\n\n-----\n\npersistent threat (APT) groups, Russian-aligned cyber threat groups, and Russian-aligned\ncybercrime groups to help the cybersecurity community protect against possible cyber\nthreats.\n\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge critical\ninfrastructure network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats—\nincluding destructive malware, ransomware, DDoS attacks, and cyber espionage—by\nhardening their cyber defenses and performing due diligence in identifying indicators of\nmalicious activity.

FSB has been known to task criminal hackers for espionagefocused cyber activity; these same hackers have separately been responsible for disruptive\nransomware and phishing campaigns.\n\nIndustry reporting identifies three intrusion sets associated with the FSB, but the U.S. and\nUK governments have only formally attributed one of these sets—known as BERSERK\nBEAR—to FSB.\n\n**BERSERK BEAR (also known as Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, Energetic Bear, and**\n**Temp.Isotope) has, according to industry reporting, historically targeted entities in**\nWestern Europe and North America including state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)\norganizations, as well as Energy, Transportation Systems, and Defense Industrial Base\n(DIB) Sector organizations. This group has also targeted the Water and Wastewater\nSystems Sector and other critical infrastructure facilities. Common TTPs include\nscanning to exploit internet-facing infrastructure and network appliances, conducting\nbrute force attacks against public-facing web applications, and leveraging\ncompromised infrastructure—often websites frequented or owned by their target—for\nWindows New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTLM) credential theft.\nIndustry reporting assesses that this actor has a destructive mandate.\n\nThe U.S. and UK governments assess that this APT group is almost certainly FSB’s Center\n16, or Military Unit 71330, and that FSB’s Center 16 has conducted cyber operations against\ncritical IT systems and infrastructure in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.\n\n**Resources: for more information on BERSERK BEAR, see the MITRE ATT&CK® webpage**\non [Dragonfly.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/groups/G0035/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**High-Profile Activity: in 2017, FSB employees, including one employee in the FSB Center**\nfor Information Security (also known as Unit 64829 and Center 18), were indicted by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) for accessing email accounts of U.S. government and military\npersonnel, private organizations, and cybersecurity companies, as well as email accounts of\n[journalists critical of the Russian government.[9] More recently, in 2021, FSB Center 16](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions)\nofficers were indicted by the U.S. DOJ for their involvement in a multi-stage campaign in\nwhich they gained remote access to U.S. and international Energy Sector networks,\ndeployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related\n[data.

SVR cyber actors’ novel tooling and techniques include:\n\nCustom, sophisticated multi-platform malware targeting Windows and Linux systems\n(e.g., GoldMax and TrailBlazer); and\nLateral movement via the “credential hopping” technique, which includes browser\ncookie theft to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) on privileged cloud accounts.\n\n[[11]](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/observations-from-the-stellarparticle-campaign/)\n\n**High-Profile Activity: the U.S. Government, the Government of Canada, and the UK**\nGovernment assess that SVR cyber threat actors were responsible for the SolarWinds Orion\nsupply chain compromise and the associated campaign that affected U.S. government\n[agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private sector organizations.[12][13][14]](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/)\n\n**Also known as: APT29, COZY BEAR, CozyDuke, Dark Halo, The Dukes, NOBELIUM, and**\n[NobleBaron, StellarParticle, UNC2452, YTTRIUM [15]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/groups/G0016/)\n\n**Resources: for more information on SVR, see:**\n\nJoint CSA Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Cyber Operations: Trends and\nBest Practices for Network Defenders\nJoint Advisory [Further TTPs associated with SVR cyber actors](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory%20Further%20TTPs%20associated%20with%20SVR%20cyber%20actors.pdf)\n[The MITRE ATT&CK webpage on APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/groups/G0016/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFor more information on the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise, see:\n\nCISA’s [Supply Chain Compromise webpage](https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise)\nCISA’s webpage on Remediating Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active\nDirectory/M365 Compromise\n[NCSC-UK Guidance Dealing with the SolarWinds Orion compromise](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/dealing-with-the-solarwinds-orion-compromise)\n\n**_GRU, 85th Main Special Service Center_**\n\n**Overview: GTsSS, or Unit 26165, is an APT group that has operated since at least 2004 and**\nprimarily targets government organizations, travel and hospitality entities, research\ninstitutions, and non-governmental organizations, in addition to other critical infrastructure\norganizations.\n\nAccording to industry reporting, GTsSS cyber actors frequently collect credentials to gain\ninitial access to target organizations. GTsSS actors have collected victim credentials by\nsending spearphishing emails that appear to be legitimate security alerts from the victim’s\nemail provider and include hyperlinks leading to spoofed popular webmail services’ logon\npages. GTsSS actors have also registered domains to conduct credential harvesting\noperations. These domains mimic popular international social media platforms and\nmasquerade as tourism- and sports-related entities and music and video streaming services.\n\n**High-Profile Activity: the U.S. Government assesses that GTsSS cyber actors have**\ndeployed Drovorub malware against victim devices as part of their cyber espionage\n[operations.[16] The U.S. Government and UK Government assess that GTsSS actors used a](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/13/2002476465/-1/-1/0/CSA_DROVORUB_RUSSIAN_GRU_MALWARE_AUG_2020.PDF)\nKubernetes® cluster to conduct widespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force access\n[attempts against hundreds of government and private sector targets worldwide.[17]](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF)\n\n**Also known as: APT28, FANCY BEAR, Group 74, IRON TWILIGHT, PawnStorm, Sednit,**\nSNAKEMACKEREL, Sofacy, STRONTIUM, Swallowtail, TG-4127, Threat Group-4127, and\n[Tsar Team [18]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/groups/G0007/)\n\n**[Resources: for more information on GTsSS, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on APT28.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/groups/G0007/)**\n\n**_GRU’s Main Center of Special Technologies_**\n\n**Overview: GTsST, or Unit 74455, is an APT group that has operated since at least 2009 and**\nhas targeted a variety of critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Energy,\nTransportation Systems, and Financial Services Sectors. According to industry reporting,\nGTsST also has an extensive history of conducting cyber espionage as well as destructive\nand disruptive operations against NATO member states, Western government and military\norganizations, and critical infrastructure-related organizations, including in the Energy Sector.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe primary distinguishing characteristic of the group is its operations use techniques aimed\nat causing disruptive or destructive effects at targeted organizations using DDoS attacks or\nwiper malware. The group’s destructive operations have also leveraged wiper malware that\nmimics ransomware or hacktivism and can result in collateral effects to organizations beyond\nthe primary intended targets. Some of their disruptive operations have shown disregard or\nignorance of potential secondary or tertiary effects.\n\n**High-Profile Activity: the malicious activity below has been previously attributed to GTsST**\n[by the U.S. Government and the UK Government.[19][20]](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-054a)\n\nGTsST actors conducted a cyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution\ncompanies in December 2015, leading to disruption of multiple companies’ operations\nand widespread temporary outages. The actors deployed BlackEnergy malware to\nsteal user credentials and used BlackEnergy’s destructive component, KillDisk, to\nmake infected computers inoperable.\nIn 2016, GTsST actors conducted a cyber-intrusion campaign against a Ukrainian\n[electrical transmission company and deployed CrashOverride malware (also known as](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA17-163A)\nIndustroyer) specifically designed to attack power grids.\nIn June 2017, GTsST actors deployed NotPetya disruptive malware against Ukrainian\nfinancial, energy, and government organizations.

These groups pose consistent threats to\ncritical infrastructure organizations globally.\n\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some cybercrime groups have\nindependently publicly pledged support for the Russian government or the Russian people\nand/or threatened to conduct cyber operations to retaliate against perceived attacks against\nRussia or materiel support for Ukraine. These Russian-aligned cybercrime groups likely pose\na threat to critical infrastructure organizations primarily through:\n\nDeploying ransomware through which cyber actors remove victim access to data\n(usually via encryption), potentially causing significant disruption to operations.\nConducting DDoS attacks against websites.\n\nIn a DDoS attack, the cyber actor generates enough requests to flood and\noverload the target page and stop it from responding.\nDDoS attacks are often accompanied by extortion.\nAccording to industry reporting, some cybercrime groups have recently carried\nout DDoS attacks against Ukrainian defense organizations, and one group\nclaimed credit for DDoS attack against a U.S. airport the actors perceived as\nsupporting Ukraine (see the Killnet section).\n\nBased on industry and open-source reporting, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and\nUK cyber authorities assess multiple Russian-aligned cybercrime groups pose a threat to\ncritical infrastructure organizations.

In addition to TrickBot, notable initial access and persistence\nvectors for affiliated actors include Emotet, Cobalt Strike, spearphishing, and stolen or weak\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials.\n\nAfter obtaining access, WIZARD SPIDER affiliated actors have relied on various publicly\navailable and otherwise legitimate tools to facilitate earlier stages of the attack lifecycle\nbefore deploying Conti ransomware.\n\nWIZARD SPIDER pledged support to the Russian government and threatened critical\ninfrastructure organizations of countries perceived to carry out cyberattacks or war against\n[the Russian government.[39] They later revised this pledge and threatened to retaliate](https://therecord.media/russia-or-ukraine-hacking-groups-take-sides/)\n[against perceived attacks against the Russian people.[40]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252513982/Conti-ransomware-gang-backs-Russia-threatens-US)\n\n**Victims: Conti victim organizations span across multiple industries, including construction**\nand engineering, legal and professional services, manufacturing, and retail. In addition,\nWIZARD SPIDER affiliates have deployed Conti ransomware against U.S. healthcare and\nfirst responder networks.\n\n**Also known as: UNC2727, Gold Ulrick**\n\n**[Resources: for more information on Conti, see joint CSA Conti Ransomware. For more](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a)**\n[information on TrickBot, see joint CSA TrickBot Malware.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-076a)\n\n**_The XakNet Team_**\n\n**Overview: XakNet is a Russian-language cyber group that has been active as early as**\nMarch 2022. According to open-source reporting, the XakNet Team threatened to target\n[Ukrainian organizations in response to perceived DDoS or other attacks against Russia.[41]](https://therecord.media/russia-or-ukraine-hacking-groups-take-sides/)\nAccording to reporting from industry, on March 31, 2022, XakNet released a statement\nstating they would work “exclusively for the good of [Russia].” According to industry\nreporting, the XakNet Team may be working with or associated with Killnet actors, who\nclaimed credit for the DDoS attacks against a U.S. airport (see the Killnet section).\n\n**Victims: according to industry reporting, in late March 2022, the XakNet Team leaked email**\ncontents of a Ukrainian government official. The leak was accompanied by a political\nstatement criticizing the Ukrainian government, suggesting the leak was politically\nmotivated.\n\n### Mitigations\n\n\n-----\n\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities urge critical\ninfrastructure organizations to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats by immediately\n(1) updating software, (2) enforcing MFA, (3) securing and monitoring RDP and other\npotentially risky services, and (4) providing end-user awareness and training.\n\n**Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT**\n**[network assets. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities and critical and](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)**\nhigh vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on\ninternet-facing equipment.\n\nConsider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a\nrisk-based assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones\nthat should participate in the patch management program.\nConsider signing up for CISA’s [cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services)\nscanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning\nservice evaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of\npublic, static IP addresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.\n**Enforce MFA to the greatest extent possible and require accounts with password**\n**logins, including service accounts, to have** **[strong passwords. Do not allow](https://www.cisa.gov/tips/st04-002)**\npasswords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an\nadversary may have access. As Russian state-sponsored APT actors have\ndemonstrated the ability to exploit default MFA protocols and known vulnerabilities,\norganizations should review configuration policies to protect against “fail open” and reenrollment scenarios. For more information, see joint CSA Russian State-Sponsored\n[Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default Multifactor Authentication](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a)\nProtocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability.\n**If you use RDP and/or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them**\n**closely. RDP exploitation is one of the top initial infection vectors for ransomware, and**\nrisky services, including RDP, can allow unauthorized access to your session using an\non-path attacker.\n\nLimit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP\nand using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed\noperationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to\nmitigate credential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a\nvirtual private network (VPN) or other means to authenticate and secure the\nconnection before allowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote\naccess/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts\nto block brute force attempts, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused remote\naccess/RDP ports.\nEnsure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled.\nDisable ports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g.,\nRDP Transmission Control Protocol Port 3389).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Provide end-user awareness and training to help prevent successful targeted social**\nengineering and spearphishing campaigns. Phishing is one of the top infection vectors\nfor ransomware, and Russian state-sponsored APT actors have conducted successful\nspearphishing campaigns to gain credentials of target networks.\n\nEnsure that employees are aware of potential cyber threats and delivery\nmethods.\nEnsure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they\nreceive a suspected phishing email or suspect a cyber incident.\n\nAs part of a longer-term effort, implement network segmentation to separate network\n**segments based on role and functionality. Network segmentation can help prevent the**\nspread of ransomware and threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between\n—and access to—various subnetworks.\n\nEnsure OT assets are not externally accessible. Ensure strong identity and access\nmanagement when OT assets needs to be externally accessible.\nAppropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network\nsegmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT\nnetwork is compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated\ncommunication between the IT and OT networks.\nOrganize OT assets into logical zones by considering criticality, consequence, and\noperational necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones\nand deploy security controls to filter network traffic and monitor communications\nbetween zones. Prohibit ICS protocols from traversing the IT network.\n\nTo further prepare for and mitigate cyber threats from Russian state-sponsored or criminal\nactors, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities encourage critical\ninfrastructure organizations to implement the recommendations listed below.\n\n### Preparing for Cyber Incidents\n\nCreate, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations\nplan.\n\nEnsure the cyber incident response plan contains ransomware- and DDoSspecific annexes. For information on preparing for DDoS attacks, see NCSC-UK\n[guidance on preparing for denial-of-service attacks.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/denial-service-dos-guidance-collection/preparing-denial-service-dos-attacks1)\nKeep hard copies of the incident response plan to ensure responders and\nnetwork defenders can access the plan if the network has been shut down by\nransomware, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nMaintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data. Backup procedures\nshould be conducted on a frequent, regular basis (at a minimum every 90 days).\nRegularly test backup procedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network\nconnections that could enable the spread of malware.\n\nEnsure the backup keys are kept offline as well, to prevent them being encrypted\nin a ransomware incident.\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and\ncovers the entire organization’s data infrastructure with a particular focus on key data\nassets.\nDevelop recovery documentation that includes configuration settings for common\ndevices and critical equipment. Such documentation can enable more efficient recovery\nfollowing an incident.\nIdentify the attack surface by mapping and accounting all external-facing assets\n(applications, servers, IP addresses) that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks or other\ncyber operations.\nFor OT assets/networks:\n\nIdentify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to—or\ncontrol of—the IT and/or OT environment.\nIdentify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or\nmanual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated from IT networks if the\nconnections create risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes.\nRegularly test contingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety-critical\nfunctions can be maintained during a cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network\ncan operate at necessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.\nRegularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS\nor OT networks need to be taken offline.\nImplement data backup procedures.\nDevelop recovery documents that include configuration settings for common\ndevices and critical OT equipment.\n\n### Identity and Access Management\n\n[Require accounts with password logins, including service accounts, to have strong](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002)\npasswords and do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored\non a system to which an adversary may have access. Consider using a password\nmanager; see NCSC-UK’s [Password Manager Buyers Guide for guidance.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/password-manager-buyers-guide)\nImplement authentication timeout and lockout features to prevent repeated failed login\nattempts and successful brute-force attempts.\nCreate a deny list of known compromised credentials and prevent users from using\nknown-compromised passwords.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecure credentials by restricting where accounts and credentials can be used and by\nusing local device credential protection features. Russian state-sponsored APT actors\nhave demonstrated their ability to maintain persistence using compromised credentials.\n\nUse virtualizing solutions on modern hardware and software to ensure credentials\nare securely stored.\nEnsure storage of clear text passwords in Local Security Authority Subsystem\nService (LSASS) memory is disabled. Note: for Windows 8, this is enabled by\ndefault. For more information see Microsoft Security Advisory Update to Improve\nCredentials Protection and Management.\nConsider disabling or limiting NTLM and WDigest Authentication.\nImplement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (refer to Microsoft:\nManage Windows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For\nWindows Server 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security\nAuthority (LSA).\nMinimize the Active Directory (AD) attack surface to reduce malicious ticketgranting activity. Malicious activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of\nKerberos’ Ticket Granting Service (TGS) and can be used to obtain hashed\ncredentials that malicious cyber actors attempt to crack.\nAudit domain controllers to log successful Kerberos TGS requests and ensure the\nevents are monitored for anomalous activity.\n\nSecure accounts.\nEnforce the principle of least privilege. Administrator accounts should have the\nminimum permission necessary to complete their tasks.\nEnsure there are unique and distinct administrative accounts for each set of\nadministrative tasks.\nCreate non-privileged accounts for privileged users and ensure they use the nonprivileged accounts for all non-privileged access (e.g., web browsing, email\naccess).\nDisable inactive accounts uniformly across the AD, MFA systems, etc.\nImplement time-based access for privileged accounts. The FBI and CISA observed\ncybercriminals conducting increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. entities on\n[holidays and weekends in 2021. Threat actors may view holidays and weekends—](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-243a)\nwhen offices are normally closed—as attractive timeframes, as there are fewer network\ndefenders and IT support personnel at victim organizations. The just-in-time access\nmethod provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the\nprinciple of least privilege (as well as the zero-trust model) by setting network-wide\npolicy to automatically disable admin accounts at the AD level. As needed, individual\nusers can submit requests through an automated process that enables access to a\nsystem for a set timeframe.\n\n### Protective Controls and Architecture\n\n\n-----\n\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity that may indicate lateral movement by\na threat actor, ransomware, or other malware. Use network monitoring tools and hostbased logs and monitoring tools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR)\ntool. EDR tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have\ninsight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.\nImplement a firewall and configure it to block Domain Name System (DNS) responses\nfrom outside the enterprise network or drop Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)\npackets. Review which admin services need to be accessible externally and allow\nthose explicitly, blocking all others by default.\n\nU.S. Defense Industrial Base organizations may sign up for the NSA\nCybersecurity Collaboration Center’s Protective Domain Name System (PDNS)\nservices.\nEnable web application firewalls to mitigate application-level DDoS attacks.\nImplement a multi-content delivery network (CDN) solution. This will minimize the\nthreat of DDoS attacks by distributing and balancing web traffic across a network.\n\n### Vulnerability and Configuration Management\n\nUse an antivirus programs that uses heuristics and reputational ratings to check a file’s\nprevalence and digital signature prior to execution. Note: organizations should assess\nthe risks inherent in their software supply chain (including its security/antivirus software\nsupply chain) in light of the existing threat landscape.\n\nSet antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets\nusing up-to-date signatures.\nUse a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets\nare identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\nImplement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can\ntrack and mitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for\nmisconfigurations and security weaknesses.\nDisable all unnecessary ports and protocols.\n\nReview network security device logs and determine whether to shut off\nunnecessary ports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for\ncommand and control activity.\nTurn off or disable any unnecessary services (e.g., PowerShell) or functionality\nwithin devices.\nIdentify business-to-business VPNs and block high-risk protocols.\nEnsure OT hardware is in read-only mode.\nEnable strong spam filters.\n\nEnable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.\nFilter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching end users.\nImplement a user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious\nwebsites or opening malicious attachments.\n\n\n-----\n\nRestrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access\nservers that are necessary and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB\nversion 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.\nReview the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your\norganization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software\nor hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\nImplement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to\nexecute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.\nOpen document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content\nfrom running.\n\n### Responding to Cyber Incidents\n\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge network\ndefenders of critical infrastructure organizations to exercise due diligence in identifying\nindicators of malicious activity. Organizations detecting potential APT or ransomware activity\nin their IT or OT networks should:\n\n1. Immediately isolate affected systems.\n2. For DDoS attacks:\n\n1. Identify the source address originating the attack via the SIEM or logging service.\n\nIf the attack is originating from a single pool of IP addresses, block IP traffic from\nsuspected IPs via access control lists or by contacting your internet service\nprovider (ISP).\n2. Enable firewall rate limiting to restrict the amount of IP traffic coming in from\n\nsuspected IP addresses\n3. Notify your ISP and enable remote triggered blackhole (RTBH).\n3. Secure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your\n\nbackup data with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.\n4. Collect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.\n5. Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter\n\nexpertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues\nthat could enable follow-on exploitation.\n6. Report incidents to appropriate cyber and law enforcement authorities:\n\n**U.S organizations: share information about incidents and anomalous activity to CISA’s**\n[24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or the FBI via your](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:report@cisa.gov)\n[local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field)\nFor ransomware incidents, organizations can also report to the U.S. Secret Service via\na [U.S. Secret Service Field Office.](http://www.secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices/)\n**Australian organizations: if you have questions about this advice or have indications**\nthat your environment has been compromised, call the ACSC at 1300 CYBER1 (1300\n[292 371).
