Over time, security](https://www.avast.com/c-malware)\ntechnology has evolved and improved greatly, making this task harder for cybercriminals. 20\n[years ago, we witnessed the frequent distribution of email worms, which caused inboxes to](https://www.avast.com/c-computer-worm)\nbe flooded with them and mail servers to collapse. Although the prevalence of email worms\n[is much lower these days, email phishing is the new prevalent threat users have to face](https://blog.avast.com/how-to-spot-email-scams-avast)\ntoday, despite email being a great tool used by most internet users.\n\nNot only have the different protection mechanisms have evolved – individuals have also\ngrown more tech-savvy, and it has become increasingly more difficult to fool them. Don’t get\nme wrong, though: Modern bad actors are professionals that make a living out of cybercrime,\nand they invest a lot in making their tricks (they sometimes deliver them in messages that\nmake their way past seasoned security professionals). In any case, we can’t underestimate\nthe ability of these cybercriminals to carry out malicious activities.\n\nWhat if an attacker could manage to make a well known company distribute an email on his\nbehalf? What if the only link in that email takes the reader to a website belonging to the same\ncompany? In this message, there aren’t any suspicious senders, suspicious URLs, or the\ninclusion of other websites – everything is legit. Chances are that this type of email will not\nonly bypass all cybersecurity layers, but it will also fool the final user.\n\n## How today’s cybercriminals are making use of this innovative technique\n\nAdobe offers a cloud service to sign documents online called Acrobat Sign, which users can\nregister for and start using it right away. Adobe Acrobat Sign allows registered users to send\na document signature request to anyone. When doing so, an email will be generated and\nsent to the intended recipients. The email includes a link to the document (which can be a\nPDF, Word document, HTML file, and so on) that will be hosted on Adobe itself.\n\nThe sender can add text that they’d like to be shown in the email, which is an important\ndetail, as it can easily be abused by cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is one of the messages that our team has captured:\n\n\n-----\n\n[The sender’s address displays as adobesign@adobesign.com, which is a legitimate email](mailto:adobesign@adobesign.com)\naddress.\n\nWhen the victim clicks on the “Review and sign'' button, it takes them to a page hosted in\n“eu1.documents.adobe.com/public/”, which is another legitimate source that belongs to\nAdobe. As I mentioned earlier, people using this service can upload a broad variety of file\ntypes to Adobe Acrobat Sign, which will be displayed in the email with the option to sign\nthem.\n\nCybercriminals include text with a link in a document that gives the victim the idea that they’ll\nbe through the content before signing it. When clicking on the link, the victim is redirected to\nanother site where they’re asked to enter a hardcoded CAPTCHA.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Once entered, the victim will be asked to download a ZIP file that contains a Redline Trojan](https://blog.avast.com/redline-stealer-malware)\nvariant that’s designed to steal passwords, crypto wallets, and more.\n\nIn the example above, the target of the attack owns a YouTube channel with hundreds of\nthousands of subscribers, so the topic of the message fits pretty well with that profile.\nFortunately, the victim realized that there was something “phishy” about the message and\ndidn’t click on the link.\n\nNot ready to face defeat, however, the attacker tried to carry out the attack again a few days\nlater. In order to increase the chances of having the malware installed, they also added\nanother link into the email sent by Adobe.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen clicking on that link, the following page will be loaded in the browser:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis page is hosted on dochub.com, which is another company that offers electronic\ndocument signing. However, in case the victim clicks on the “Review and sign” button within\nthe email it will take them to Adobe and will show the very same document to be signed\n\n\n-----\n\n(that also contains the same link in it).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe link in the documents that’s loaded on both dochub.com and adobe.com takes the victim\nto the same CAPTCHA (which is hardcoded):\n\nWhen entered correctly, it takes the victim to the download of the malware, which was\nanother Redline Trojan variant. In this instance, the ZIP file also contained some other nonmalicious executables belonging to the Grand Theft Auto V game.\n\nOne of the characteristics of the two variants of Redline that these cybercriminals used in\nthese attacks is that they’ve artificially increased the size of the Trojan to more than 400MB.\nThis is not noticeable by the victim during the download, as the file is compressed and most\nof that artificial size has just been filled with zeros. The reason for this is unknown; it’s\npossible that the cybercriminals are using it in the hope of bypassing some antivirus engines\nthat could behave differently with big files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis abuse of Adobe Acrobat Sign to distribute malware is a new technique used by\nattackers that’s targeted to a specific victim. Our team has yet to detect other attacks using\nthis technique; nevertheless, we fear that it may become a popular choice for cybercriminals\nin the near future. This is because it may be able to avoid different anti-malware filters, which\nincreases its chances of reaching the victims. In any case, we have already contacted both\nAdobe and dochub.com and shared all the information of the incidents with them.\n\n## How you can protect yourself\n\nDon’t click on email links from unknown senders. Pay extra close attention to anything\nthat you receive from those you don’t know.\n\nCheck your sources. Before clicking on a link, ask yourself why you’ve received it and if\nit can be considered to be legitimate.\n\nUse security software. Security software, or [antivirus, acts as a safety net, protecting](https://www.avast.com/index#pc)\neven the most tech-savvy internet users.\n\n\n-----",
