PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known\nvulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks as well as software and\nhardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive\nnetworks.\nThis joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and\nstate, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the\nDefense Industrial Base Sector; and private sector organizations about notable trends\nand persistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\nNSA, CISA, and FBI urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and\nprivate sector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations\nsection and Appendix A to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of\ncompromise from PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber actors.\nFor more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s\nChina Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage, FBI’s Industry Alerts, and\nNSA’s Cybersecurity Advisories & Guidance.\n\nThis document is marked TLP:WHITE.

NSA, CISA, and FBI assess PRC\nstate-sponsored cyber actors have actively targeted U.S. and allied networks as well as\nsoftware and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into\nsensitive networks.

A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote\ncode execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port\ndifferent from the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of\nApache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin which overrides the client\nIP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug in the code, this check can be bypassed.\nRecommended Mitigations\n In affected versions of Apache APISIX, you can avoid this risk by explicitly commenting out\nbatch-requests in the conf/config.yaml and conf/config-default.yaml files and restarting Apache\nAPISIX.\n Update to 2.10.4 or 2.12.1.\nDetection Methods\nN/A\n\nTLP:WHITE\nU/OO/206133-22 | PP-22-1455 | OCT 2022 Ver 1.0\n\n12\n\nNSA, CISA, & FBI | Top CVEs Actively Exploited By PRC State-Sponsored Actors\nTLP:WHITE\nVulnerable Technologies and Versions\nApache APISIX between 1.3 and 2.12.1 (excluding 2.12.1)\nLTS versions of Apache APISIX between 2.10.0 and 2.10.4\nTable XVII: ZOHO CVE-2021-40539\n\nZOHO CVE-2021-40539 CVSS 3.0: 9.8 (Critical)\nVulnerability Description\nZoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus version 6113 and prior is vulnerable to REST API\nauthentication bypass with resultant remote code execution.\nRecommended Mitigations\n Upgrade to latest version.\nDetection Methods\n Run ManageEngine’s detection tool.\n Check for specific files and logs.\nVulnerable Technologies and Versions\nZoho Corp ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus\n\nTable XVIII: Microsoft CVE-2021-26857\n\nMicrosoft CVE-2021-26857 CVSS 3.0: 7.8 (High)\nVulnerability Description\nMicrosoft Exchange Server remote code execution vulnerability.

It is awaiting reanalysis,\nwhich may result in further changes to the information provided. A flaw was found in a change\nmade to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. A malicious actor could use a path\ntraversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files\noutside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied,\"\nthese requests can succeed. Enabling CGI scripts for these aliased paths could allow for remote code\nexecution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and\nnot earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 is incomplete (see CVE-2021-42013).\nRecommended Mitigations\n Apply update or patch.\nDetection Methods\n Commercially available scanners can detect CVE.\nVulnerable Technologies and Versions\nApache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50\nFedoraproject Fedora 34 and 35\nOracle Instantis Enterprise Track 17.1-17.3\nNetapp Cloud Backup\n\nTLP:WHITE\nU/OO/206133-22 | PP-22-1455 | OCT 2022 Ver 1.0\n\n14\n\nNSA, CISA, & FBI | Top CVEs Actively Exploited By PRC State-Sponsored Actors\nTLP:WHITE\n\nTLP:WHITE\nU/OO/206133-22 | PP-22-1455 | OCT 2022 Ver 1.0\n\n15",
