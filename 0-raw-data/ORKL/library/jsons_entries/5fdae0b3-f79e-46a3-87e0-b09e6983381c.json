    "plain_text": "# March 2023’s Most Wanted Malware: New Emotet Campaign Bypasses Microsoft Blocks to Distribute Malicious OneNote Files\n\n**blog.checkpoint.com/security/march-2023s-most-wanted-malware-new-emotet-campaign-bypasses-microsoft-blocks-**\nto-distribute-malicious-onenote-files/\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\n## Check Point Research reports that Emotet Trojan launched a new campaign last month to evade Microsoft’s macro block, sending spam emails containing malicious OneNote files. Meanwhile Ahmyth was the most prevalent mobile malware and Log4j took top spot once again as the most exploited vulnerability\n\nOur latest Global Threat Index for March 2023 saw researchers uncover a new malware\ncampaign from Emotet Trojan, which rose to become the second most prevalent malware\nlast month.\n\nAs reported earlier this year, Emotet attackers have been exploring alternative ways to\n[distribute malicious files since Microsoft announced they will block macros from office files. In](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked)\nthe latest campaign, the attackers have adopted a new strategy of sending spam emails\ncontaining a malicious OneNote file. Once opened, a fake message appears to trick the\nvictim into clicking the document, which downloads the Emotet infection. Once installed, the\nmalware can gather user email data such as login credentials and contact information. The\nattackers then use the gathered information to expand the reach of the campaign and\nfacilitate future attacks.\n\nWhile big tech companies do their best to cut off cybercriminals at the earliest point, it’s near\nimpossible to stop every attack from bypassing the security measures. We know that Emotet\nis a sophisticated Trojan and it’s no surprise to see it has managed to navigate Microsoft’s\n\n\n-----\n\nlatest defenses. The most important thing people can do is make sure they have appropriate\nemail security in place, avoid downloading any unexpected files and adopt heathy skepticism\nabout the origins of an email and its contents.\n\nLast month also revealed that “Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution” was the most\nexploited vulnerability, impacting 44% of organizations globally, followed by “HTTP Headers\nRemote Code Execution” with 43% of organizations worldwide and “MVPower DVR Remote\nCode Execution” with a global impact of 40%.\n\n**Top Malware Families**\n\n_*The arrows relate to the change in rank compared to the previous month._\n\n**Qbot was the most prevalent malware last month with an impact of more than 10% on**\nworldwide organizations respectively, followed by Emotet and Formbook with a 4% global\nimpact.\n\n1. ↔ Qbot – Qbot AKA Qakbot is a banking Trojan that first appeared in 2008. It was\n\ndesigned to steal a user’s banking credentials or keystrokes and is often distributed via\nspam emails.

Threat actors often abuse this open-source software by integrating it\ninto their malware to conduct illegal mining on victims’ devices.\n6. ↔ GuLoader – Guloader is a downloader that has been widely used since December\n\n2019. When it first appeared, GuLoader was used to download Parallax RAT but has\nbeen applied to other remote access trojans and info-stealers such as Netwire,\nFormBook, and Agent Tesla.\n\n\n-----\n\n7. ↑ Remcos – Remcos is a RAT that first appeared in the wild in 2016. Remcos\n\ndistributes itself through malicious Microsoft Office documents, which are attached to\nSPAM emails, and is designed to bypass Microsoft Windows’s UAC security and\nexecute malware with high-level privileges.\n8. ↑ NJRat – NJRat is a remote accesses Trojan, targeting mainly government agencies\n\nand organizations in the Middle East. The Trojan first emerged in 2012 and has\nmultiple capabilities: capturing keystrokes, accessing the victim’s camera, stealing\ncredentials stored in browsers, uploading and downloading files, performing process\nand file manipulations, and viewing the victim’s desktop. NJRat infects victims via\nphishing attacks and drive-by downloads, and propagates through infected USB keys\nor networked drives, with the support of Command & Control server software.\n9. ↔ Tofsee – Tofsee is a Trickler that targets the Windows platform. This malware\n\nattempts to download and execute additional malicious files on target systems. It may\ndownload and display an image file to a user to hide its true purpose.\n10. ↓ NanoCore – NanoCore is a Remote Access Trojan that targets Windows operating\n\nsystem users and was first observed in the wild in 2013. All versions of the RAT contain\nbasic plugins and functionalities such as screen capture, crypto currency mining,\nremote control of the desktop and webcam session theft.\n\n**Top Attacked Industries Globally**\n\nLast month, Education/Research remained the most attacked industry globally, followed by\n**Government/Military and then Healthcare.**\n\n1.
