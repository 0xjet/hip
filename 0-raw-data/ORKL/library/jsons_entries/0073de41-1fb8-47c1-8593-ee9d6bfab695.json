Any additions to the CISA KEV_\n_Catalog after that date are not reflected in this report._\n\nIn [last week’s blog, we looked at the vulnerabilities the Cyber Security & Infrastructure](https://vulncheck.com/blog/2022-cisa-kev-review)\nAgency (CISA) added to the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) Catalog in 2022. In the\nreport,we mentioned CISA missed some actively exploited vulnerabilities that had been\nassigned CVEs in 2022. The KEV Catalog is the driving force for vulnerability management\nin the US federal civilian executive branch, and many private companies have adopted it as\n\n\n-----\n\nthe de facto standard. As such, excluding any exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability is a big deal\nwith potentially far-reaching effects. This blog will share 42 likely exploited-in-the-wild\nvulnerabilities assigned CVEs in 2022 that haven’t been included in the KEV Catalog.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nVulnCheck identified 42 vulnerabilities that were assigned CVEs in 2022 and reported to\nhave been, or likely to have been, exploited in the wild that were not added to the CISA\nKEV Catalog.\nOf the 42 CVEs, an overwhelming majority are related to botnets (64%). However, there are\nalso a number of ransomware (10%) and threat actor (12%) attributions.\nSome missing vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2016-20016, have been exploited in the wild\nsince 2017 and still have thousands of potential targets online.\n76.2% of the missing vulnerabilities were initial access, which VulnCheck recommends\nprioritizing.\nThe CISA KEV Catalog is undoubtedly helpful and a driving force in our industry. Still, as\nlong as it’s missing actively exploited vulnerabilities, it cannot be treated as the authoritative\ncatalog of exploited vulnerabilities.\n\n## The Missing Vulnerabilities\n\nUsing publicly-available reporting, VulnCheck identified 42 vulnerabilities that were assigned\nCVEs in 2022 and reported to have been, or likely to have been, exploited in the wild. The\nexploited-in-the-wild sources include a variety of world-class security organizations, including\nTalos, ESET Research, Avast, FortiGuard Labs, Rapid7, and more.\n\nThe public reporting often tells us who was doing the exploitation: ransomware, botnets,\nthreat actors, etc. The “who” is essential, as it can change the criticality of a vulnerability. A\nvulnerability exploited by ransomware is much more concerning than a vulnerability exploited\nby a Mirai botnet. VulnCheck breaks down the “who” into four general “attacker-type”\ncategories:\n\n1. Botnets (e.g. [Mirai,](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.mirai) [Zerobot, etc.)](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.zerobot)\n[2. Ransomware (e.g Clop)](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.clop)\n3. Threat Actors (e.g. [APT32)](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/apt32)\n4. Unattributed (a source notes exploitation in the wild but doesn’t provide any attribution\n\ninformation)\n\nThe following table contains all 42 vulnerabilities, the reported attacker type, and the publiclyavailable source indicating likely exploitation in the wild.\n\n**CVE-ID** **VulnCheck Attacker-Type** **Exploited Source**\n\n\n-----\n\n**CVE-ID** **VulnCheck Attacker-Type** **Exploited

Research](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/eset_threat_report_t22022.pdf)\n\n## Botnets\n\nLooking over the table, it’s probably obvious that an overwhelming majority of the\nvulnerabilities are related to botnets (64%). However, there are also a number of\nransomware (10%) and threat actor (12%) attributions.\n\nAttacker-Type of Exploited Vulnerabilities Assigned CVE in 2022 Missing From CISA\nKEV\n\nThe high rate of botnet-exploited vulnerabilities is interesting. Mirai-like botnets are wellknown for flinging exploits all over the internet. That behavior is quickly picked up by\nhoneypots and intelligence-sharing organizations like Unit 42, 360 Netlab, and Fortiguard\nLabs. The high volume of botnet vulnerabilities should be some of the easiest to classify as\nexploited in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, one of the 42 vulnerabilities missing from the CISA KEV Catalog is CVE-201620016 (aka [EDB-41471). This vulnerability, which finally received a CVE in 2022, has been](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41471)\n[exploited in the wild for years, and still has thousands of potential targets online. It’s had a](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=html%3A%22id%3D%5C%22dvr_usr%5C%22%22)\nMetasploit module since 2017 and is routinely one of the most widely attempted exploit\n[targets on both ShadowServer and](https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/honeypot/monitoring/vulnerability/?category=monitoring&statistic=unique_ips) [Greynoise. The NVD entry even notes “exploited in the](https://viz.greynoise.io/trends?view=active)\nwild in 2017 through 2022.” It’s obvious this vulnerability belongs in the KEV Catalog.\n\n## Vulnerability Classification and Exploits\n\nLast week, we analyzed the type of vulnerabilities that were added to KEV in 2022. We found\nabout ⅓ of the vulnerabilities are Initial Access, ⅓ are Client Side, and the other ⅓ fell to the\nremaining five vulnerability types that VulnCheck assigns. However, the 42 missing\nvulnerabilities don’t match that pattern,likely due to the healthy helping of botnet-exploited\nvulnerabilities.\n\nMissing Exploited Vulnerabilities Classification\n\n[At VulnCheck, we’re very interested in initial access vulnerabilities specifically because they](https://vulncheck.com/product/initial-access-intelligence)\nare so dangerous. Many of these vulnerabilities appear to provide initial access to small\nrouters and IoT systems. Some will dismiss vulnerabilities in such targets. However, we\nknow those types of targets are used by advanced threat actors to create massive botnets\n[like VPNFilter, and(taken down just last year) Cyclops Blink. So, these vulnerabilities should](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPNFilter)\nbe taken seriously.\n\nThey should also be taken seriously because most of them are well-known. More than 30 of\nthe vulnerabilities have public exploits, and at least four of those have Metasploit modules.\nAdditionally, seven have commercially available exploits.\n\nExploited Vulnerabilities with Exploits\n\n## Individual Vulnerabilities\n\nEach of the missing 42 vulnerabilities have interesting context around them too, partly due to\nthe many different sources and unique points of view shared in their public reporting. Going\nthrough each would be tedious, but the following sections give insight into a few\nvulnerabilities that should give readers a general feel for the top vulnerabilities CISA missed.\n\n### Chimay Red\n\n[CVE-2017-20149, also known as Chimay Red, is a peculiar case. The details of the](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-20149)\n[vulnerability were originally leaked in 2017 during the Vault 7 leak. The vulnerability affected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_7)\n[the HTTP interface of Mikrotik routers (of which, there are currently more than 600k visible](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=title%3A%22RouterOS%22)\n\n\n-----\n\non Shodan). Shortly after the disclosure, a high quality exploit was developed by Lorenzo\nSantina. Eventually attackers, including the Hajime botnet, exploited this vulnerability in the\nwild.\n\n[While the vulnerability is getting old, Greynoise continues to see active scanning for the](https://viz.greynoise.io/tag/chimay-red-scanner)\n[vulnerability and, using Shodan, we can find approximately 10,000 internet-facing hosts that](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=title%3A%22RouterOS+router%22+os%3A%22MikroTik+RouterOS+6.0%22%2C%226.1%22%2C%226.10%22%2C%226.11%22%2C%226.12%22%2C%226.13%22%2C%226.14%22%2C%226.15%22%2C%226.16%22%2C%226.17%22%2C%226.18%22%2C%226.19%22%2C%226.2%22%2C%226.20%22%2C%226.21%22%2C%226.21.1%22%2C%226.22%22%2C%226.23%22%2C%226.24%22%2C%226.25%22%2C%226.26%22%2C%226.27%22%2C%226.28%22%2C%226.29%22%2C%226.3%22%2C%226.30%22%2C%226.30.1%22%2C%226.30.2%22%2C%226.30.4%22%2C%226.31%22%2C%226.32%22%2C%226.32.1%22%2C%226.32.2%22%2C%226.32.3%22%2C%226.33%22%2C%226.33.1%22%2C%226.33.2%22%2C%226.33.3%22%2C%226.33.5%22%2C%226.34%22%2C%226.34.1%22%2C%226.34.2%22%2C%226.34.3%22%2C%226.34.4%22%2C%226.34.5%22%2C%226.34.6%22%2C%226.35%22%2C%226.35.1%22%2C%226.35.2%22%2C%226.35.4%22%2C%226.36%22%2C%226.36.1%22%2C%226.36.2%22%2C%226.36.3%22%2C%226.37%22%2C%226.37.1%22%2C%226.38%22%2C%226.38.1%22%2C%226.38.2%22%2C%226.38.3%22%2C%226.38.4%22%2C%226.4%22%2C%226.5%22%2C%226.6%22%2C%226.7%22%2C%226.8%22%2C%226.9%22)\nare still vulnerable.\n\nHowever, the most fascinating part of Chimay Redis that it didn’t receive a CVE until 2022\nwhen VulnCheck requested one (MITRE chose to back-date the year). This vulnerability has\nbeen exploited in the wild for approximately five years, and no one saw fit to request a CVE.\nHaving a CVE is a requirement to be included in the CISA KEV Catalog, and, sadly, appears\nto be the only way to remain in the vulnerability historical record.\n\n[It’s also worth noting that back when the Shadow Brokers leak occurred, there was an effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers)\nto identify and assign CVE to zero-day vulnerabilities that had been leaked. This was\nobviously not the case here. The responsible parties should have done the right thing and\nensured this was assigned a CVE five years ago. Maybe there wouldn’t be any more\nvulnerable internet-facing Mikrotik routers if they did.\n\n### CVE-2022-28810\n\n[CVE-2022-28810 is an authenticated unrestricted operating system command execution](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28810)\nvulnerability affecting ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus. ManageEngine products have\nbeen included in several CISA advisories. For example, in October 2022, a ManageEngine\nvulnerability, CVE-2021-40539, was included in a bulletin titled, Top CVEs Actively Exploited\n_By People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors._\n\n[This vulnerability was first seen in the wild in April 2022 as a zero-day by Rapid7 (full](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/04/14/cve-2022-28810-manageengine-adselfservice-plus-authenticated-command-execution-fixed/)\ndisclosure: this author was involved in the analysis of the vulnerability). Additionally, ESET\n[Research noted in their APT Activity Report T2 2022 report that a “defense contractor in the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/eset_apt_activity_report_t22022.pdf)\nUS” was targeted using this vulnerability. Although ESET couldn’t attribute the attack to a\nspecific group, it was lumped in with “China-aligned” APT activity.\n\n### CVE-2022-2003\n\n[Dragos researchers shared a great writeup on finding CVE-2022-2003 in the wild. The](https://www.dragos.com/blog/the-trojan-horse-malware-password-cracking-ecosystem-targeting-industrial-operators/)\nvulnerability was discovered in a PLC “password cracking” program advertised on social\nmedia. Dragos found the cracking software actually worked as advertised, and the software\nrecovered passwords from AutomationDirect’s DirectLOGIC PLC by exploiting CVE-20222003. Also, hilariously, the cracking software drops malware on the host machine in order to\njoin it to the Sality botnet.\n\n\n-----\n\nICS-specific vulnerabilities exploited in the wild are few and far between. Dragos uncovered\nan attacker specifically targeting PLC and engineering workstations. Given the attacker’s\nactive engagement on social media, this vulnerability seems like it should have been an easy\nadd to the KEV Catalog.\n\n### CVE-2022-31199\n\n[Cisco Talos was able to link CVE-2022-31199, a vulnerability in Netwrix Auditor, to Truebot](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31199)\n[activity (and eventually Clop ransomware) in an early December 2022 blog.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/breaking-the-silence-recent-truebot-activity/)\n\n[An advisory for CVE-2022-31199 was published by Bishop Fox in July 2022. The advisory](https://bishopfox.com/blog/netwrix-auditor-advisory)\nhas no CVE, but it is linked directly to NVD. To our knowledge, there is no public exploit for\nthis vulnerability. However, the Bishop Fox advisory, from our experience, provides sufficient\ndetails to recreate the exploit with minimal effort. That’s likely why Talos saw the vulnerability\nexploited a “few weeks” after the advisory was published.\n\n[Netwrix Auditor isn’t exactly a household name, and there are fewer than a dozen internet-](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&sort=RELEVANCE&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.banner%3A%22.NET%22+and+Services.banner%3A%22System.Runtime.Remoting.RemotingException%3A+Tcp+channel+protocol+violation%22+and+services.port%3A9004+and+services.service_name%3A%22UNKNOWN%22+and+services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.issuer.common_name%3A%22Netwrix%22)\nfacing targets. The fact that an attacker chose to weaponize this vulnerability and it was\nexploited in the wild shows how valuable initial access vulnerabilities are to attackers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog, we shared 42 vulnerabilities assigned CVEs in 2022, which were publicly\nreported to be exploited in the wild. Yet, none of these vulnerabilities are in the CISA KEV\nCatalog. The CISA KEV Catalog is undoubtedly helpful and a driving force in our industry.\nStill, as long as it’s missing actively exploited vulnerabilities, it cannot be treated as the\nauthoritative catalog of exploited vulnerabilities. Practitioners should augment vulnerability\nmanagement programs by seeking out additional sources or finding a source with a more\ncomplete dataset.\n\nFor more information on vulnerabilities exploited in the wild, register for a VulnCheck account\n[today by loading https://vulncheck.com and clicking “Log In”.](https://vulncheck.com/)\n\n\n-----",
