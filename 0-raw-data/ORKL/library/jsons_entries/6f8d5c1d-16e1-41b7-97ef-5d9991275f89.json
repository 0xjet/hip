We found them targeting countries in the Middle East\nsuch as United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as well as other countries such as India, Japan, Argentina,\nthe Philippines, and South Korea.\n\nThis blog post covers the updates from TA505’s campaigns and indicators of compromise (IoCs), as well as\nthe latest tactics, techniques, and procedures of these campaigns, particularly those observed in late June. We\nalso analyzed a new malware tool named Gelup (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.Win32.GELUP.A),\nwhich we saw the group use in one of the campaigns on June 20.\n\nGelup abuses user account control (UAC) bypass and works as a loader for other threats. The tool also uses\nthe packer of [FlawedAmmyy, a remote access trojan, from previous campaigns. TA505 is also using](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/spam-campaign-abusing-settingcontent-ms-found-dropping-same-flawedammy-rat-distributed-by-necurs/)\nFlowerPippi (Backdoor.Win32.FLOWERPIPPI.A), a new backdoor that we found them using in their\ncampaigns against targets in Japan, India, and Argentina. Our in-depth analysis of the Gelup malware and\nFlowerPippi backdoor, including their infection chains and C&C communication, is detailed in our **_technical_**\n**_brief._**\n\n**_Targeting the UAE_**\nTA505 targeted Middle Eastern countries in a June 11 campaign that delivered more than 90% of the total\nspam emails to the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Morroco. The spam emails contained either an .html or .xls file\nattachment. The HTML file leads to a download of another Excel file embedded with malicious Excel 4.0\nmacro, which then downloads a FlawedAmmyy downloader (in .msi file) that leads to the FlawedAmmyy\npayload. The direct .xls attachments were equipped with VBA macro. It fetches the same FlawedAmmyy\ndownloader .msi file, then downloads the FlawedAmmyy payload. Figure 2 shows the campaign’s infection\nchain\n\n\n-----\n\nwith HTML and Excel files.\n\nFigure 1. A sample spam email delivered to TA505’s targets in the Middle East\n\nFigure 2. Infection chain of the spam emails with the FlawedAmmyy RAT\n\nFigure 3. Sample spam email sent on June 13 (top), and screenshot of code showing how the HTML file\n\ndownloading a malicious document (bottom)\n\nOn June 14, we saw TA505’s campaign still targeting UAE with similar tactics and techniques, but this time,\nsome of the spam emails were delivered via the Amadey botnet. They used Wizard (.wiz) files in this\ncampaign, with FlawedAmmyy RAT as the final payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Sample spam email from a campaign observed on June 14\n\nOn June 18, the majority of the campaign’s spam emails were sent with the subject, “Your RAKBANK Tax\nInvoice / Tax Credit Note” or “Confirmation.” This campaign used the abovementioned .html file, malicious\nExcel/Word document VBA macro, the FlawedAmmyy payload, and Amadey. It later delivered an\ninformation stealer named “EmailStealer,” which stolesimple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) credentials and\nemail addresses in the victim’s machine. We found at least hundreds of SMTP credentials on their C&C\nserver. It also collected more than a million email addresses, 80% of which were either .com or .ae top-level\ndomains (TLDs).\n\nFigure 5. A sample spam email from the campaign observed on June 18 (top); snippet of code showing the\nmalware-embedded .doc file that will be downloaded (center); and snapshot of email credentials being stolen\n\n(bottom)\n\nOn June 24, we found another campaign targeting Lebanon with the ServHelper malware. This one had subcampaigns that targeted India and Italy with different email content.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn June 17, we observed the campaign s spam emails delivering malware embedded Excel files directly as\nan attachment. The spam emails used subject lines such as “Emirates NBD E-Statement” and “Visa\nCanceled” as social engineering lures. This campaign used the ServHelper loader, which was downloaded by\nthe VBA macro.\n\nA closer inspection of the email showed that its content would have been more applicable to Arabic-speaking\nusers or countries, particularly the UAE. In the spam emails that used “Visa Canceled” on the subject line, for\nexample, the email claims to be from the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs – Dubai,\nand contained Arabic content. Nonetheless, these spam emails were not delivered to the UAE or Arabicspeaking users, but to banks in Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n\nFigure 7. Sample spam email from a campaign observed on\nJune 17 (top); the ServHelper-related command-and-control (C&C) traffic (center); and sample spam email\n\nfrom a similar campaign that used a mix of .html and .xls files to deliver the ServHelper loader\n\n**_Targeting Japan, Philippines, South Korea, and Argentina_**\nOn June 20, we spotted the campaign’s spam emails delivering .doc and .xls files. We found the malicious\nVBA macro downloading an apparently new and undocumented malware named FlowerPippi, as well as\nGelup (the details of the malware will be discussed below).\n\nOn the same day, the campaign targeting South Korea also used .doc and .xls attachments. We did not find\nany attachments in the few samples we came across, but we found malicious URLs directly in the email\ncontent instead. These URLs lead to the download of malicious .xls files or .doc files, with the final payload\nstill being the FlawedAmmyy RAT. This gave us the opportunity to observe TA505’s method of using URLs\nto deliver the entry point malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Screenshot of a spam email targeting Japan, the Philippines, and Argentina (top), and another that\n\ntargets South Korea, which directly uses or embeds a malicious URL instead of an attachment (bottom)\n\n**_Gelup Downloader Malware and FlowerPippi Backdoor_**\nIn the campaign that targeted Japan, Philippines, and Argentina on June 20, we found what seems to be a\nnew, undisclosed malware, which we named Gelup. After our analysis, we found that Proofpoint reported this\nmalware as [AndroMut as well. A custom packer was used to pack some variants of this malware — the same](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-begins-summer-campaigns-new-pet-malware-downloader-andromut-uae-south)\none that TA505 had been using.\n\nThe unpacked payload is written in C++ and basically works as a downloader for another malware. What\nmakes Gelup different, however, is its obfuscation technique and UAC-bypassing function by mocking\ntrusted directories (spoofing the file’s execution path in a trusted directory), abusing auto-elevated\n[executables, and using the dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading technique. As explained in our](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-Latest-Spam-Campaigns-from-TA505-Now-Using-New-Malware-Tools-Gelup-and-FlowerPippi.pdf) **_technical_**\n**_brief, Gelup supports techniques that can deter static and dynamic analyses, and has multilayered steps for_**\ninstalling itself into the system.\n\nAnother new malware we found that TA505 is using in their campaigns last June 20 against targets in Japan,\nthe Philippines, and Argentina is FlowerPippi. This malware acts as a backdoor and downloader, and is a\nstandalone malware tool and retrieved more straightforwardly than Gelup. Our **_[technical brief provides more](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Tech-Brief-Latest-Spam-Campaigns-from-TA505-Now-Using-New-Malware-Tools-Gelup-and-FlowerPippi.pdf)_**\ndetails on FlowerPippi’s capabilities and routines.\n\n**_Best practices and mitigation_**\nAs our research shows, the scale and extent of TA505’s campaigns, which deliver a multitude of threats —\nfrom [ransomware to information stealers and backdoors — make them significant security issues to](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware)\norganizations. Their active operations and ever-changing tactics are worth noting. In fact, we’ve already seen\nthis in a recently [disclosed research on their activities on the UAE, South Korea, Singapore, and the U.S.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-begins-summer-campaigns-new-pet-malware-downloader-andromut-uae-south)\n\nBut more importantly, TA505’s spam campaigns highlight the importance for organizations to secure their\nonline infrastructures, particularly the email gateways. Adopt [best practices on thwarting messaging-related](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-email-threats)\nthreats; enforce the principle of least privilege to mitigate further exposure; and regularly update systems (or\n[use virtual patching for legacy systems) to prevent attackers from taking advantage of security gaps.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/security-technology/security-101-virtual-patching)\nAdditional security mechanisms like enabling [firewalls and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/security-technology/best-practices-deploying-an-effective-firewall) [intrusion detection and prevention systems will](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/capabilities/intrusion-prevention.html)\nhelp thwart suspicious network activities that may indicate red flags like data exfiltration or C&C\ncommunication.\n\n[Organizations can also consider Trend Micro™ endpoint solutions such as](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps.html?utm_campaign=VURL:www.trendmicro.com&utm_medium=VURL&utm_source=/us/enterprise/network-security/interscan-web-security/index.html) Trend Micro Smart Protection\nSuites and [Worry-Free™ Business Security.
