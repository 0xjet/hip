    "plain_text": "# Global Ransomware and Cyberattacks on Healthcare Spike during Pandemic\n\n**[labs.bitdefender.com/2020/05/global-ransomware-and-cyberattacks-on-healthcare-spike-during-pandemic/](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/05/global-ransomware-and-cyberattacks-on-healthcare-spike-during-pandemic/?utm_campaign=twitter&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitter)**\n\n[Liviu ARSENE](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/larsene/)\nMay 13, 2020\n\nOne product to protect all your devices, without slowing them down.\n\n[Free 90-day trial](http://10.10.0.46/media/html/consumer/new/get-your-90-day-trial-opt/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nWith healthcare systems under constant strain amid the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic,\nhospitals and healthcare facilities around the world have also been hit by a wave of\n[cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks. While officials have already issued warnings](https://www.europol.europa.eu/covid-19/covid-19-ransomware)\nthat hospitals, governments and universities may be more conscious about losing data and\naccess to critical systems, Bitdefender telemetry reveals that the number of cyberattacks and\nransomware incidents directly targeting healthcare significantly increased over the past\ncouple of months.\n\nThe number of cyberattacks detected at hospitals in March increased by almost 60 percent\nfrom February, according to Bitdefender telemetry. This is the highest spike in our global\nevolution of cyberattacks detected at hospitals reported over the past 12 months, showing\nthat cybercriminals have clearly leveraged the pandemic to launch these campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nHospitals face a wide array of generic threats (spray and prey or smash and grab) but\nransomware causes the most damages and disruption to their operations. Because\neverything is digital and ransomware blocks access to computers and databases, hospital\nactivity can be paralyzed, with no admissions, no discharges, and no access to patient data.\n\nThe number of successfully blocked ransomware attacks at hospitals, as shown by\nBitdefender telemetry, jumped significantly in February, March and April. If during 2019 the\nhighest spike in blocked ransomware attacks detected at hospitals was registered in August,\nduring March 2020 the number of blocked ransomware reports rose almost 73 percent.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s likely that, since hospitals have been facing new procedures and measures, and new\ndocumentation regarding the pandemic on a daily basis, especially during the past couple of\nmonths, attackers have been impersonating public institutions and global healthcare\norganizations to trick medical staff into clicking on malicious URLs or opening infected\nattachments.\n\nWhile Coronavirus-themed threats have become the norm during the past couple of months,\nit’s not just the healthcare industry that has been assaulted by a wave of attacks. From retail\nto hospitality and leisure, education and government, all verticals have registered an\nincrease in malware related to the new Coronavirus.\n\nAs these attacks are mostly opportunistic by nature, exploiting popular media topics, the\nglobal evolution of Coronavirus-themed malware reports seems linked to how the actual\n[SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads around the world. Previous telemetry from Bitdefender showed](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/04/coronavirus-themed-threat-reports-havent-flattened-the-curve/)\nthat, while the real-world virus hit Europe hardest during the first weeks of March, attackers\nalso focused on Europe when distributing threats. Just weeks later, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nspread to the United States, malware telemetry started to spike there as well.\n\nAs March seems to have been the peak of both the global pandemic and of Coronavirusthemed cyberattacks, Bitdefender has been offering free access to its enterprise-grade\n[security at zero-cost (http://www.bitdefender.com/freehealthcaresecurity) to healthcare](http://www.bitdefender.com/freehealthcaresecurity)\norganizations of all sizes around the world, from small dental and ophthalmic practices to\nlarge hospitals.\nBitdefender’s offer is open to all global healthcare organizations, and our goal is to help them\nwork at full capacity without worrying about cyberattack leveraging the pandemic.\n\n**_Note:_** **_This article is based on technical information provided courtesy of Bitdefender_**\n**_Labs teams._**\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/) [miscellaneous](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/miscellaneous/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Liviu ARSENE\n\n\n-----\n\nLiviu Arsene is the proud owner of the secret to the fountain of never-ending energy.
