Computer attacks known as “APT” (Advanced**\n\n**Persistent Threat) have become widely reported and emphasized by the media, damages are now considered as real**\n\n**and strategic trends are moving in cyber defense.**\n\n**Today, we decided to release publicly information on a specific group of APT attackers known as “Pitty Tiger”. This**\n\n**information comes directly from investigations led by our Threat Intelligence and enlights the activities of a structured**\n\n**organization working in the APT field.**\n\n**You can get more information in our** **[Whitepaper.](http://bitbucket.cassidiancybersecurity.com/whitepapers/downloads/Pitty Tiger Final Report.pdf)**\n\n### Pitty Tiger investigation context\n\n**During our regular investigations on APT cases, one particular variant of malware caught our attention, because we**\n\n**had not faced it before. We decided to spend some time to investigate around this malware and found out that it was**\n\n**used exclusively by a single group of attackers. This malware family is known as “PittyTiger” by the anti-virus**\n\n**community.**\n\n**We discovered this malware sample in June 2014, leading to a command & control (c&c) server still in activity.**\n\n**Our researches around the malware family revealed the “Pitty Tiger” group has been active since 2011, yet we found**\n\n**traces which makes us believe the group is active since 2010.**\n\n**This group uses other malware and tools during their APT operations, in addition to the PittyTiger RAT. The main**\n\n**malware are:**\n\n**PittyTiger**\n\n**[Troj/ReRol.A](http://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses/viruses-and-spyware/Troj~Rerol-A/detailed-analysis.aspx)**\n\n**CT RAT**\n\n**MM RAT (aka** **[Troj/Goldsun-B)](http://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses/viruses-and-spyware/Troj~Goldsun-B/detailed-analysis.aspx)**\n\n**Paladin RAT (a variant of Gh0st RAT)**\n\n### Infection methods\n\n**The Pitty Tiger group mostly uses spear phishing in order to gain an initial foothold within the targeted environment.**\n\n**The group exploits known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office products to infect their targets with malware.**\n\n**Pitty Tiger group is sometimes using stolen material as spear phishing content to target other persons. They have also**\n\n**been seen using HeartBleed vulnerability in order to directly get valid credentials.**\n\n### Malware information\n\n**One of the favorite methods used by the Pitty Tiger group to infect users is to use a Microsoft Office Word document**\n\n**which exploits a specific vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158). The group could also use CVE-2014-1761, which is more**\n\n**recent.**\n\n**The payload infecting the system is malware known as “Troj/ReRol.A”. It is generally the first step of the initial**\n\n**compromise for Pitty Tiger campaigns.**\n\n**Once compromised, PittyTiger rat is often installed. This RAT is the origin of the attackers’ group name. “PittyTiger” is**\n\n**a mutex used by the malware. “Pitty Tiger” is also a string transmitted in the network communications of the RAT.**\n\n**But things are changing. CT RAT seems to be an evolution of PittyTiger, since a specific server binary we found could**\n\n**handle both requests from CT and PittyTiger, and was indicated as compatible with PittyTiger. Moreover, the same**\n\n**commands are implemented in both RATs.**\n\n**As a matter of fact, this group does neither use one favorite RAT nor two but many...**\n\n**We named as “MM RAT” a specific code at the beginning of our investigation, before we found an existing name for it,**\n\n**“Troj/Goldsun-B” according to Sophos. This is another remote administration tool often used by the Pitty Tiger crew.**\n\n**Paladin RAT is another remote administration tool used by the Pitty Tiger group. This malware is a variant of the**\n\n**[infamous Gh0st RAT . Our specific sample uses “ssss0” instead of the usual “Gh0st” header for network](http://www.mcafee.com/sg/resources/white-papers/foundstone/wp-know-your-digital-enemy.pdf)**\n\n**communications. The commands ID used in the communication protocol have also changed, but the features are**\n\n**quite the same.**\n\n**Additionally to the Paladin RAT previously mentionned, we found another variant of Gh0st RAT, named “Leo”. Although**\n\n**we have found it on a c&c server of the group, there is no evidence that is has been used by the group, in opposition**\n\n**to Paladin which is used often by Pitty Tiger**\n\n\n**log**\n\n**anonymization**\n\n**welcome**\n\n**GoodFET**\n\n**Z-Wave**\n\n**side-channels**\n\n**critical infrastructures**\n\n**Hardware Trojans**\n\n**Sakula**\n\n**BlackVine**\n\n**advanced persistent threat**\n\n**ransomware**\n\n**reconnaissance**\n\n**bitcrypt**\n\n**APT kill chain**\n\n#### PlugX\n\n Advanced Persistent Threat\n## reverse engineering\n# malware\n\n**APT**\n\n**All tags**\n\n\n**Useful Links**\n\n\n**[Cybersecurity Job offers](http://www.cybersecurity-airbusds.com/contact-us/join-us/)**\n\n**[AIRBUS D&S CyberSecurity](http://www.cybersecurity-airbusds.com)**\n\n**[BitBucket CyberTools](https://bitbucket.org/cybertools/)**\n\n\n**Share**\n\n\n**0**\n\n\n**Subscribe**\n\n\n**Entries feed**\n\n\n-----\n\n**c&cs used by the group, had one very common flaw: the attackers had misconfigured the access control of several**\n\n**folders. Once parsed and dumped, it provided us more insight.**\n\n**Pitty Tiger, like other APT attackers, often use anti-virus “familiar names” when registering domains or creating**\n\n**subdomains. Some examples can be avstore.com.tw, sophos.skypetm.com.tw, symantecs.com.tw, trendmicro.org.tw**\n\n**etc.**\n\n**We have been able to list the main domains registered and used by Pitty Tiger as c&c servers:**\n\n### VICTIMS\n\n**Mapping the victims of such a targeted campaign is not an easy task.**\n\n**We have found the Pitty Tiger group to be very active against one particular private company from the defense**\n\n**industry and one academic network of a government,, yet we think it was done to be used as a proxy for some of the**\n\n**group’s operations.**\n\n**We have also found some connections from other companies to the c&c servers, yet we did not find evidence that they**\n\n**were real victims.**\n\n**These supposed victims do work in different sectors and are located mostly in European countries.**\n\n**1 company from the defense industry;**\n\n**1 company from the energy industry;**\n\n**1 company from the telecommunications industry;**\n\n**1 company specialized in web development.**\n\n### ATTACKERS\n\n**We found out interesting information about the Pitty Tiger group.**\n\n**We have been able to get all the RDP connections to one c&c server:**\n\n**These connections are either VPS or dynamic IP addresses, mostly from China.**\n\n### ROLES AND ORGANIZATION\n\n**According to indicators we gathered and threat activities profiling we have some hypothesis on the way the group is**\n\n**conducting its operations.**\n\n**We have strong evidence of a bot operator position. We identify one nickname for this position, the user known as**\n\n**TooT. As we did not see other nickname, we think that TooT is one person and not a group of persons.**\n\n**We also identified a malware development position We identified two nicknames for this position on the current**\n\n\n-----\n\n**g** **p** **p** **,** **p** **, p**\n\n**logistics support (weaponized document, tools…) and reviews the programmers work. This position could imply a**\n\n**communication channel with another manager. We named this position ‘Chen’, in relation with several references of**\n\n**this common Chinese name in c&c WHOIS and other investigation materials.**\n\n**We have some suspicion of a customer relationship manager position that may act as an interface between a**\n\n**customer and Chen. We named this position ‘Lilly’.**\n\n**A proposal for Pitty Tiger team structure**\n\n### ATTACKERS ARSENAL\n\n**The c&c servers used by the attackers revealed a lot of interesting files stored in various folders, building a real**\n\n**attackers arsenal of malware and tools:**\n\n**Malware (Troj/ReRol.A)**\n\n**Remote Administration Tools (MM RAT, CT RAT, Pitty Tiger, Paladin)**\n\n**E-mail espionage tools (cp.exe, mailpv.exe)**\n\n**Passwords dumpers (gsecdump, NirSoft tools, Mimikatz etc.)**\n\n**Network scanners (pr.exe)**\n\n**Network-oriented tools (po.exe)**\n\n**Vulnerability scanners (ssql.exe, Fluxay, etc.)**\n\n**What is rare to find is the controller part of those tools. We have been lucky enough to get the controller part of Pitty**\n\n**Tiger and CT RAT, and even to get a kind of hybrid controller made for CT RAT but also supporting Pitty Tiger. We**\n\n**suppose that the CT RAT is the new evolution of Pitty Tiger and that it will replace Pitty Tiger in the following months.**\n\n**The presence of a Chinese version of “calc.exe”, the official calculator provided in Microsoft Windows, is interesting.**\n\n**Not only is it one more indicator of a probable Chinese origin, but also an indicator that this server was probably used**\n\n**as a test base, in addition to being operational and controlling infected machines from different targets.**\n\n### ATTRIBUTION\n\n**Determining who is exactly behind an APT campaign is difficult. We tried to extract different technical indicators,**\n\n**together with contextual elements.**\n\n**Information relating to the tools used by the attackers has been leveraged for attribution:**\n\n**Several Chinese vulnerability scanners have been launched against targets;**\n\n**Several Chinese tools have been used and found on the c&c servers of the attackers: 8uFTP, a Chinese version of**\n\n**calc.exe, etc.;**\n\n**Two of the used RATs have been developed by the same developers: CT RAT and PittyTiger RAT. The controllers**\n\n**for these RATs show Chinese language;**\n\n**Several binaries used by the attackers show either “Chinese - China” or “Chinese-Taiwan” language ID in their**\n\n**resources;**\n\n**A decoy Word document has been found, written in Chinese language;**\n\n**The IP addresses used for the hosting of the c&c domains are mainly located in Taipei (Taïwan) and Hong Kong City**\n\n**(Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, PRC):**\n\n\n-----\n\n**All the items listed in this part are strong indicators that the attackers might be Chinese.**\n\n**Read the full** **[Whitepaper for more information](http://bitbucket.cassidiancybersecurity.com/whitepapers/downloads/Pitty Tiger Final Report.pdf)**\n\n**[Legal notice.](http://blog.cassidiancybersecurity.com/pages/Legal-notice)**\n\n\n-----",
