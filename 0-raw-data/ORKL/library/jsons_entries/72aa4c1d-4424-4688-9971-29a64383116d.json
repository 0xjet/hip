In Q1 2020, we\n\ndetected 22.5 percent more attacks than in Q4 2019.\n\n� The share of targeted attacks remains unchanged from Q4 2019\n\n(67%).\n\n� In Q1 2020, there were 23 very active APT groups. Their attacks\n\ntargeted mostly government agencies, industry, finance, and med\nical institutions.\n\n� About 13 percent of all phishing emails of Q1 2020 were related to\n\nCOVID-19. Of those, about a half (44%) targeted individuals. One\n\nout of every five mailings was sent to government agencies.\n\n� More than a third (34%) of all attacks on organizations using\n\nmalware were attacks with ransomware. Sodinokibi, Maze, and\n\nDoppelPaymer were the most active ones. Operators of these and\n\nsome other ransomware created their own websites where they\n\npublish stolen data if the victims refuse to pay the ransom.\n\n� The share of attacks against individuals was 14 percent. Logins and\n\npasswords make up half of the data stolen. This is because mal\nware campaigns against individuals contained a large percentage\n\nof spyware (56%).\n\nWe expect that the number of attacks against remote workstations\n\nwill be growing globally. Because people are working from home now,\n\ncompanies may soon see an increased number of attempts to hack\n\ncorporate credentials or exploit vulnerabilities in remote access sys\ntems. These threats are especially relevant for companies that have no\n\nstrict password policy and no regular software updates.\n\nWeb application firewalls (WAFs) can block potential attacks against\n\nweb applications on the network perimeter, including attacks against\n\nremote access systems, such as Citrix Gateway. To prevent infection of\n\ncomputers of the employees with malware, we recommend checking\n\nemail attachments for malicious activity with sandboxes. We also rec\n[ommend following the general recommendations for ensuring person-](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/what-companies-can-do-to-stay-safe/)\n\nal and corporate cybersecurity.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Statistics\n\nIn Q1 2020, we registered 22.5 percent more attacks than in Q4 2019. The beginning of the year was\n\ntough on the whole world. The COVID-19 pandemic messed up the global economy and the life of\n\nall ordinary people.

Cybercriminals don't stop at using a single\n\ntype of malware. They use multifunctional trojans or inject compromised devices with a whole\n\nbunch of assorted malware. Hackers keep looking for ways to bypass antiviruses and security\n\ntools embedded in the OS. For instance, since early 2020 we keep seeing attempts to use the\n\n[new vulnerability CVE-2020-0601 in Windows CryptoAPI for signing malware. This vulnerability](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0601)\n\nallows bypassing certificate checks. Another example is SysUpdate remote access trojan. This is\n\na unique tool developed by BronzeUnion APT group. The hackers use it to deliver payload to the\n\ndevices under their control. Usually this payload is not detected by antiviruses, because the file\n\nhas an indefinite format and the antivirus can't recognize it. Another example is FakeChmMsi, a\n\n[malware with a complex chain for delivering the Gh0st trojan. Along the chain, DLL hijacking is](https://trustfoundry.net/what-is-dll-hijacking/)\n\nused twice, complicating analysis of the malware by any antivirus. Modern malware can bypass\n\nantiviruses, firewalls, IPS, mail and web gateways, but it can be efficiently countered with sand\nboxes. Those are solutions allowing one to launch a file in an isolated virtual environment and\n\nanalyze it for malicious activity.\n\nThe greatest number of malware attacks on corporate infrastructure came from ransomware.\n\nIndividuals were mostly attacked with infostealers, keyloggers, and banking trojans.\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n34%\nRansomware\n9%\n\n\n32%\nSpyware\n\n25%\nRATs\n9%\n\n14%\nDroppers\n9%\n\n\n56%\n\n\n2%\nBanking trojans\n\n5%\nMiners\n2%\n\n\n23%\n\n\nAdware\n\n\n1%\n\n\n12%\n\n\n3%\n\nOther\n7%\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nFigure 7. Types of malware (percentage of attacks using malware)\n\n\n-----\n\nSame as before, eight out of ten malware campaigns against organizations started with emails\n\nwith attachments. Individuals risk getting their computers infected not only via emails, but also\n\nby visiting sites and downloading software from untrusted resources. For instance, in Q1 the\n\n[hackers have compromised a number of WordPress sites and redirected the visitors to phishing](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=13746&lng=en)\n\nsites spreading a backdoor disguised as a Chrome browser update.

Malware distribution methods\n\n### Phishing emails about COVID-19\n\nThe hackers were quick to use the common concern about the new coronavirus for their phishing\n\nemails. According to our estimates, in Q1 2020 about 13 percent of social engineering attacks\n\nwere related to the coronavirus.\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n12% 14% 44%\n\nIndividuals\n\nGovernment\n\nIndustrial companies\n\nOther\n\nMultiple industries\n\n10% 20%\n\nFigure 9. Categories of victims of phishing emails about COVID-19\n\n\n-----\n\nStarting from the second half of January, we see an increase in the number of phishing emails\n\nrelated to COVID-19. The pandemic situation was used both for mass malware campaigns and\n\nfor APT attacks. In Q1, Emotet, Remcos, AZORult, Agent Tesla, LokiBot, TrickBot, and many other\n\ntrojans were distributed in the guise of official information about infection statistics, a vaccine,\n\nand prevention measures, allegedly coming from the authorities and medical institutions.\n\nIn February, Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT ESC) detected an attack from\n\nTA428 group. As a decoy, the group sent out a document with coronavirus infection statistics. By\n\nthe way, in January that group used the deteriorating relations between U.S. and Iran as the topic\n\nfor their emails. Malicious documents delivered a loader with encrypted Poison IVY shell code to\n\nthe victim's computer.\n\nFigure 10. Document with COVID-19 statistics from TA428 emails\n\nIn March, PT ESC registered four sets of phishing emails the hackers used to distribute the\n\nChinoxy backdoor. In one of the documents, the attackers used a text related to saving the\n\nbudget during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. The document from the Chinoxy email\n\n[Groups like TA505, Hades, Mustang Panda, APT36, Higaisa, and SongXY also sent out emails with](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/operation-ta505/)\n\nmalicious attachments related to the pandemic. We will discuss the last two in more detail in the\n\nsection about attacks on government agencies.\n\n### The virus intervenes\n\nDue to the pandemic, many countries sent schoolchildren and students to study from home, and\n\nemployers were instructed to send their personnel to work from home, if they could. In this situ\nation, many companies have to use VPN to arrange remote access to their corporate network for\n\n[their employees. As you know, lately the attackers have been actively exploiting vulnerabilities in](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ClearSky-Fox-Kitten-Campaign.pdf)\n\nVPN solutions and remote access systems, such as products by Pulse Secure, Fortinet, Palo Alto,\n\nand Citrix. We recommend immediately installing the latest updates released by those manufac\nturers. Otherwise, the risk of compromise is quite high. For instance, the British company called\n\n[Finastra fell victim to ransomware in March because they used unpatched versions of Citrix ADC](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-fintech-firm-finastra-hit-by-ransomware-shuts-down-servers/)\n\nand VPN by Pulse Secure.\n\n\nDangerous vulnerabilities in VPN solutions\n\nand remote access systems\n\n[CVE-2019-19781 Citrix](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19781)\n\n[CVE-2019-11510 Pulse Secure](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11510)\n\n[CVE-2019-11539 Pulse Secure](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11539)\n\n[CVE-2018-13379 Fortinet](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13379)\n\n[CVE-2018-13382 Fortinet](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13382)\n\n[CVE-2018-13383 Fortinet](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13383)\n\n[CVE-2018-1579 Palo Alto Networks](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-1579)\n\n\nAttackers set\n\non exploitation\n\n� Operators of Sodinokibi\n\nransomware\n\n� APT5\n\n� APT33\n\n� APT34\n\n� APT39\n\n� APT41\n\n\n-----\n\n[Because of the large number of people shifting to home office, there are now more hosts acces-](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/work-from-home-digital-distancing-to-keep-your-network-safe/)\n\nsible for RDP connection. We expect that companies all over the world will see an increase in\n\nattacks on RDP starting in Q2 2020. For instance, the famous banking trojan TrickBot already got\n\n[a new module called rdpScanDll which bruteforces credentials for RDP connection.](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/03/new-trickbot-module-bruteforces-rdp-connections-targets-select-telecommunication-services-in-us-and-hong-kong/)\n\nWhen more people started using Zoom videoconferencing, the hackers started paying closer at\n[tention to it, too. Over 1,700 phishing domains related to the name of the popular platform were](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/03/30/covid-19-impact-cyber-criminals-target-zoom-domains/)\n\nregistered in Q1 2020. Active use of Zoom app revealed a number of vulnerabilities. Specialists\n\n[from Check Point discovered that the platform had a vulnerability allowing the attackers to join](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/zoom-zoom-we-are-watching-you/)\n\nsomeone's video conference without an invite. Unsanctioned breach of Zoom online confer\n[ences was dubbed Zoom-bombing.

Private calls, recordings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/03/thousands-zoom-video-calls-left-exposed-open-web/)\n\nof business meetings, doctors' sessions, and classes were made public. In addition, at the end of\n\n[Q1 news came about a UNC path injection vulnerability allowing the hackers to steal Windows](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zoom-lets-attackers-steal-windows-credentials-run-programs-via-unc-links/)\n\ncredentials via Zoom.\n\nWith quarantine and self-imposed isolation, there is an increased demand for takeout food and\n\n[food products delivery services. The hackers used this to stage a DDoS attack against takeaway.com,](https://twitter.com/jitsegroen/status/1240332307262832642)\n\ndemanding 2 bitcoins for stopping it. Attackers also interfered with the work of medical institu\ntions. We will discuss these attacks later, in the Industry Specific section.\n\n### Citrix vulnerability put to use\n\nIn Q1 2020, 12 percent of malware was delivered to the companies by compromising network\n\nequipment, servers, or workstations. One of the vulnerabilities currently used to deliver mal\n[ware is a vulnerability in some Citrix products (CVE-2019-19781). The vulnerability became widely](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19781)\n\n[known back in the end of 2019. It is a critical vulnerability allowing an unauthorized attacker to](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/citrix-vulnerability-allows-criminals-to-hack-networks-of-80000-companies/)\n\nrun arbitrary code. The vulnerability affected about 80,000 organizations worldwide, with most\n\n[of the victims in the state sector. The manufacturer released final patches on January 24, 2020.](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2020/01/24/citrix-releases-final-fixes-for-cve-2019-19781/)\n\n[In Q1 2020, the APT41 group used this vulnerability in targeted attacks against government agen-](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html)\n\ncies, finance, telecom, industry, healthcare, and the media. In addition, vulnerability CVE-2019\n[19781 was presumably exploited during attacks against the infrastructure of Potsdam and the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/city-of-potsdam-servers-offline-following-cyberattack/)\n\n[Defence Signals Directorate in Australia.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/citrix-vulnerability-used-for-potential-defence-recruitment-database-access/)\n\nIn January, specialists from FireEye found that unknown perpetrators install a backdoor named\n\n[NOTROBIN on vulnerable Citrix devices.

The hackers now create their own sites where they publish the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/three-more-ransomware-families-create-sites-to-leak-stolen-data/)\n\nstolen data.

Attack targets (percentage of attacks on government agencies)\n\n\nThe percentage of malware and social engineering attacks against government agencies has\n\nincreased significantly compared to Q4 2019. The pandemic may have been a factor. Many at\ntackers sent emails to government agencies of various countries, with a malicious attachment\n\n[related to the coronavirus infection. In January 2020, PT ESC registered two attacks by SongXY](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-q4-2017/)\n\nAPT group. The attackers used a text in Mongolian, which very likely indicates that they target a\n\nspecific region. The text contained information about COVID-19 outbreak in China. The RTF doc\n[ument with exploit for vulnerability CVE-2018-0798 saved an encrypted loader to the victim's](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0798)\n\nhard drive, decrypted it, launched it, and then loaded the main payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. The decoy text in RTF format about COVID-19 from the SongXY email\n\n[In Q1 2020, PT ESC detected two attacks by the Higaisa group. That group attacks govern-](https://prog.world/new-year-greetings-and-covid-19-how-hackers-use-the-news/)\n\nment agencies, diplomatic missions, and organizations promoting human rights in China, North\n\nKorea, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, Russia, and other countries. Both campaigns started with phish\ning emails. The first one used a text about national holidays and current news in North Korea. In\n\nthe second case, the group disguised the malicious LNK file as a PDF document about COVID-19.\n\nFigure 17. Document from the email of Higaisa APT group\n\n\n-----\n\nPT ESC also detected 14 attacks of Gamaredon group, targeting government agencies of Ukraine\n\n[and Georgia. As usual, the group used template injection, a technique we discussed at the end of](https://ired.team/offensive-security/initial-access/phishing-with-ms-office/inject-macros-from-a-remote-dotm-template-docx-with-macros)\n\n[last year. This technique allows the hackers to deliver the malicious macro codes, which executes](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2019-q4/)\n\na VBScript (VBS). Starting mid-February, the group uses obfuscation to protect VBS from detec\ntion. The method of gaining a foothold on the infrastructure changed, too. The VBS now creates\n\nthe RUN key in the Windows registry, ensuring it keeps functioning after reboot.\n\nFigure 18. Document from the phishing email by Gamaredon group\n\n##### Industrial companies\n\nMalware infection is still a valid threat for the industry. The greatest threats are spyware and\n\nransomware. They made 42 percent and 28 percent of all malware attacks on industry, respec\ntively. In Q1 2020, we saw attacks on industry with Maze, Sodinokibi, Ryuk, and DoppelPaymer\n\nransomware.\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\nMalware use\n\nSocial engineering\n\nHacking\n\nWeb attacks\n\n\n90%\n\n85%\n\n6%\n\n4%\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nFigure 19.

Attack targets (percentage of attacks on industry)\n\n\n[At the beginning of the year, many cybersecurity experts turned their attention to the new](https://labs.sentinelone.com/new-snake-ransomware-adds-itself-to-the-increasing-collection-of-golang-crimeware/)\n\n[ransomware called Snake, capable of deleting shadow copies and stopping processes related to](https://labs.sentinelone.com/new-snake-ransomware-adds-itself-to-the-increasing-collection-of-golang-crimeware/)\n\nICS operation. For instance, Snake can stop the processes of GE Proficy and GE Fanuc Licensing,\n\nHoneywell HMIWeb, FLEXNet Licensing Service, Sentinel HASP License Manager, and ThingWorx\n\nIndustrial Connectivity Suite. The attackers presumably want to use Snake in targeted attacks\n\nagainst industry. The ransomware leaves a file on the compromises computer, instructing the victim\n\nwhat to do next, with bapcocrypt@ctemplar[.]com set as contact email. PT ESC theorized this may\n\nbe a reference to the attack on Bapco company. At the end of 2019, it was attacked with Dustman\n\nmalware designed to delete data. It is possible that Dustman and Snake are related, because the\n\nsamples of the two became available to the public at about the same time, and both targeted\n\nindustry.\n\nJust like government agencies, industry is targeted by many APT groups worldwide. For instance,\n\none of the APT attacks by Bisonal group in Q1 2020 targeted Russian aerospace organizations. PT\n\nESC determined that in that particular attack, the remote control malware (RAT) was delivered by\n\nemails with malicious RTF documents as attachments. The group created those documents using\n\n[the Royal Road exploit builder.](https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html)\n\nFigure 21. The document from the Bisonal email\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Russia and the CIS countries, the industry is still attacked by RTM group. PT ESC detected 29\n\nmalicious mailings by the group during the first quarter.\n\nFigure 22. A message with malicious attachment sent by RTM to an industrial company\n\n##### Healthcare\n\nThe number of attacks on healthcare has increased significantly compared to Q4 2019. This is\n\nbecause the cybercriminals took an increased interest in healthcare facilities currently on the\n\nfront lines of coping with the coronavirus pandemic. With stress and heavy workload on the\n\nmedical staff, we see more successful attacks, because the healthcare workers may not be so\n\ncareful about the stream of emails they receive now.\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\nQ1 2019\n\nQ2 2019\n\nQ3 2019\n\nQ4 2019\n\n\n28\n\n\n32\n\n\n22\n\n\n11\n\n\n**Q1 2020** **45**\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nFigure 23.

Attack targets (percentage of attacks on healthcare)\n\nIn 78 percent of attacks on healthcare, the hackers used social engineering. Attackers would send\n\nphishing emails to convince the staff to enter corporate credentials in a fake authentication form.\n\nMalware infection threat is just as real. In the early hours of March 13, a cyberattack by unknown\n\n[perpetrators crashed the network of a large medical center in Brno (Czech Republic) testing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/czech-hospital-hit-by-cyber-attack-while-in-the-midst-of-a-covid-19-outbreak/)\n\n[people for coronavirus infection. A day later, Hammersmith Medicines Research, a British](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/03/23/covid-19-vaccine-test-center-hit-by-cyber-attack-stolen-data-posted-online/#7bb10dd18e55)\n\n[company preparing to test a coronavirus vaccine, was attacked by Maze ransomware. Remember](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2019-q4/)\n\nthat the hackers behind the Maze attacks were among the first to demand a ransom for not\n\ndisclosing the data stolen before encryption. That time, the victim refused to pay and restored\n\n[their system quickly. A few days later, Maze operators promised to stop attacking healthcare](https://hotforsecurity.bitdefender.com/blog/hacking-group-promises-to-stop-attacking-medical-units-until-covid-19-cools-down-22657.html)\n\ninstitutions during the pandemic. However, after that promise was made, they published the data\n\nstolen from Hammersmith Medicines Research. This proves yet again that one can never trust\n\ncybercriminals. Their promises do not guarantee that the stolen data will be recovered and that\n\nit will not end up on the Net.\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n38% 13% 3% 46%\n\nPersonal data\n\nMedical records\n\nCredentials\n\nOther\n\nFigure 26. Data stolen\n\n\n-----\n\n### About the research\n\nIn this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the most\n\nimportant and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from our own\n\nexpertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data from authoritative sources.\n\nIn our view, the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to reputational\n\nrisks. The result is that even organizations that investigate incidents and analyze\n\nactivity by hacker groups are unable to perform a precise count. This research is\n\nconducted in order to draw the attention of companies and ordinary individuals\n\nwho care about the state of information security to the key motives and methods\n\nof cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the main trends in the changing cyberthreat\n\nlandscape.\n\nIn this report, every mass attack (where the attackers send out a phishing email to\n\nmany addresses, for instance) was considered as one incident. Terms used in this\n\nreport:\n\nA cyberthreat is a combination of factors and circumstances that create the risk of\n\ninformation security compromise. We look at cyberthreats in terms of the actions\n\nof malefactors in cyberspace who attempt to breach an information system in\n\norder to steal money or data, or with other intentions potentially causing harm to\n\ngovernment, business, or individuals. Attacker actions may be directed against the\n\ntarget company's IT infrastructure, workstations, mobile devices, other equipment,\n\nor at people as a factor in cyberspace.\n\nA cyberattack consists of unauthorized actions targeting information systems and\n\ntheir users by cybercriminals leveraging techniques and software to obtain access\n\nto information, impair the normal functioning or availability of systems, or to steal,\n\nalter, or delete information.\n\nA **mass attack is a cyberattack against a wide range of companies or individuals.**\n\nIn a mass attack, attackers may not restrict themselves to a single industry, or may\n\neven ignore the industries of their targets entirely—their objective is to compromise\n\nas many victims as they can.\n\nA targeted attack is a cyberattack targeting a specific company, a certain industry,\n\nor a limited number of individuals. A targeted attack usually involves reconnaissance\n\nto gather information about the target.\n\nAn **APT attack (advanced persistent threat attack) is a well-organized and well-**\n\nplanned multistage targeted attack. APT attacks are performed by criminal groups\n\n(APT groups) consisting of highly skilled people. Because of this, APT groups have\n\nsignificant financial resources and technical capabilities.\n\nAn **attack target is the target of unauthorized actions by cybercriminals. For**\n\ninstance, this could be web resources, computers, servers, network equipment,\n\nmobile devices, or the IoT. People can be an attack target too, if the attackers use\n\nsocial engineering.\n\n**Attack methods are the set of techniques used by attackers to achieve their goal.**\n\n**Hacking means exploitation of vulnerabilities and security flaws to gain access**\n\nto resources or information. For greater granularity, some hacking methods have\n\nbeen placed in separate categories. For instance, bruteforcing credentials to\n\naccessible services is considered separately from exploitation of vulnerabilities in\n\nweb applications.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Positive Technologies\n\n[ptsecurity.com](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ru-ru/)\n[pt@ptsecurity.com](mailto:pt%40ptsecurity.com?subject=)\n[facebook.com/PositiveTechnologies](http://facebook.com/PositiveTechnologies)\n[facebook.com/PHDays](http://facebook.com/PHDays)\n\nCybersecurity threatscape 2020 Q1 A4 ENG 0004 01\n\n\nFor 18 years, Positive Technologies has been creating innovative solutions for information security.
