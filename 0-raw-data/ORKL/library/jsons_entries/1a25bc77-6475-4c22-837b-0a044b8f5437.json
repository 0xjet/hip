ESET](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/apt-attacks-telecoms-africa-mgbot)\nResearch has observed the group conducting cyberespionage against individuals in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Nigeria.\nGovernment entities were targeted in China, Macao, and Southeast and East Asian countries, specifically Myanmar, the Philippines, Taiwan,\nand Vietnam, while other organizations in China and Hong Kong were also targeted. According to public reports, the group has also targeted\nunknown entities in Hong Kong, India, and Malaysia.\n\nThe group implements its own custom malware framework with a modular architecture that allows its backdoor, known as MgBot, to receive\nmodules to spy on its victims and enhance its capabilities.\n\n## Campaign overview\n\nIn January 2022, we discovered that while performing updates, a legitimate Chinese application had received an installer for the Evasive\nPanda MgBot backdoor. During our investigation, we discovered that the malicious activity went back to 2020.\n\nChinese users were the focus of this malicious activity, which ESET telemetry shows starting in 2020 and continuing throughout 2021. The\ntargeted users were located in the Gansu, Guangdong, and Jiangsu provinces, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Map of China showing where users were targeted_\n\nThe majority of the Chinese victims are members of an international NGO that operates in two of the previously mentioned provinces.\n\nOne additional victim was also discovered to be located in the country of Nigeria.\n\n## Attribution\n\n[Evasive Panda uses a custom backdoor known as MgBot, which was publicly documented in 2014 and has seen little evolution since then; to](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/02/needle-haystack)\nthe best of our knowledge, the backdoor has not been used by any other group. In this cluster of malicious activity, only the MgBot malware\nwas observed deployed on victimized machines, along with its toolkit of plugins. Therefore, with high confidence we attribute this activity to\nEvasive Panda.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nDuring our investigation, we discovered that when performing automated updates, a legitimate application software component downloaded\nMgBot backdoor installers from legitimate URLs and IP addresses.\n\nIn Table 1, we provide the URL from where the download originated, according to ESET telemetry data, including the IP addresses of the\nservers, as resolved at the time by the user’s system; therefore, we believe that these IP addresses are legitimate. According to passive DNS\nrecords, all of these IP addresses match the observed domains, therefore we believe that these IP addresses are legitimate.\n\n_Table 1. Malicious download locations according to ESET telemetry_\n\n**URL** **First seen** **Domain IP** **ASN** **Downloader**\n\n\nhttp://update.browser.qq[.]com/qmbs/QQ/QQUrlMgr_QQ88_4296.exe 2020‑11‑02 123.151.72[.]74 AS58542\n\n183 232 96[ ]107 AS56040\n\n\nQQUrlMgr.exe\n\nQQ.exe\n\nQQLive.exe\n\nQQCall<XX>.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n**URL** **First seen** **Domain IP** **ASN** **Downloader**\n\n61.129.7[.]35 AS4811\n\n### Hypotheses of compromise\n\nWhen we analyzed the likelihood of several methods that could explain how the attackers managed to deliver malware through legitimate\nupdates, we were left with two scenarios: supply-chain compromise, and adversary-in-the-middle attacks. For both scenarios we will also take\ninto account antecedents of similar attacks by other Chinese-speaking APT groups.\n\nTencent QQ is a popular Chinese chat and social media service. In the next sections, we will use the Tencent QQ Windows client software\nupdater, QQUrlMgr.exe (listed in Table 1), for our examples, given that we have the highest number of detections from downloads by this\nparticular component.\n\n**Supply-chain compromise scenario**\n\nGiven the targeted nature of the attacks, we speculate that attackers would have needed to compromise the QQ update servers to introduce\na mechanism to identify the targeted users to deliver them the malware, filtering out non-targeted users and delivering them legitimate\nupdates – we registered cases where legitimate updates were downloaded through the same abused protocols.\n\nWhile not an Evasive Panda case, a prime example of this type of compromise is in our report Operation NightScout: Supply‑chain attack\ntargets online gaming in Asia, where attackers compromised the update servers of a software developer company based in Hong Kong.\nAccording to our telemetry, more than 100,000 users had the BigNox software installed, but only five had malware delivered through an\nupdate. We suspect that the attackers compromised the BigNox API on the update server to reply to the updater component on the machines\nof targeted users with a URL to a server where the attackers hosted their malware; non-targeted users were sent the legitimate update URL.\n\nBased on that antecedent, in Figure 2 we illustrate how the supply-chain compromise scenario could have unfolded according to observations\nin our telemetry. Still, we must warn the reader that this is purely speculation and based on our static analysis, with very limited information, of\nQQUrlMgr.exe (SHA-1: DE4CD63FD7B1576E65E79D1D10839D676ED20C2B).\n\n_Figure 2. Sequence diagram of the hypothesized supply-chain compromise_\n\nIt is also worth noting that during our research we were never able to retrieve a sample of the XML “update” data – neither a legitimate, nor a\nmalicious, XML sample – from the server contacted by QQUrlMgr.exe. The “update check” URL is hardcoded, in obfuscated form, in the\nexecutable, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3. Obfuscated URL in the legitimate QQUrlMgr.exe binary_\n\nDeobfuscated, the complete update check URL is:\n\n\n-----\n\nttp //c gj qq[ ]co / cg b /bus\nbusid=20&supplyid=30088&guid=CQEjCF9zN8Zdyzj5S6F1MC1RGUtw82B7yL+hpt9/gixzExnawV3y20xaEdtektfo&dm=0\n\nThe server responds with XML-formatted data encoded with base64 and encrypted with an implementation of the TEA algorithm using a 128bit key. This data contains instructions to download and execute a file, along with other information. Since the decryption key is also\nhardcoded, as shown in Figure 4, it could be known to the attackers.\n\n_Figure 4. Hardcoded key in the legitimate QQUrlMgr.exe binary_\n\nQQUrlMgr.exe then downloads the indicated file, unencrypted, via HTTP and hashes its contents with the MD5 algorithm. The result is\nchecked against a hash present in the update check response XML data, as seen in Figure 5. If the hashes match, QQUrlMgr.exe executes\nthe downloaded file. This reinforces our hypothesis that the attackers would need to control the XML server-side mechanism in the update\nserver to be able to provide the correct MD5 hash of the malware installer.\n\n_Figure 5. QQUrlMgr.exe code that orchestrates the download of the update_\n\nWe believe that this scenario would explain our observations; however, many questions are left unanswered. We reached out to Tencent’s\n[Security Response Center to confirm the legitimacy of the full URL from where the malware was downloaded; update.browser.qq[.]com is – at](https://en.security.tencent.com/)\nthe time of writing – unreachable, but Tencent could not confirm whether the full URL was legitimate.\n\n**Adversary-in-the-middle scenario**\n\n[On 2022-06-02, Kaspersky published a research report about the capabilities of the Chinese-speaking LuoYu APT group and their WinDealer](https://securelist.com/windealer-dealing-on-the-side/105946/)\nmalware. Similar to what we observed on this cluster of Evasive Panda victims, their researchers found that, since 2020, victims of LuoYu had\n[received the WinDealer malware through updates via the legitimate application qgametool.exe from the PPTV software, also developed by a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPTV)\nChinese company.\n\nWinDealer has a puzzling capability: instead of carrying a list of established C&C servers to contact in case of a successful compromise, it\ngenerates random IP addresses in the 13.62.0.0/15 and 111.120.0.0/14 ranges from China Telecom AS4134. Although a small coincidence,\nwe noticed that the IP addresses of the targeted Chinese users at the time of receiving the MgBot malware were on the AS4134 and AS4135\nIP addresses ranges.\n\nPossible explanations for what enables these capabilities for its C&C infrastructure are that LuoYu either control a large amount of devices\n[associated with the IP addresses on those ranges, or that they are able to do adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) or attacker-on-the-side](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1557/)\ninterception on the infrastructure of that particular AS.\n\nAitM styles of interception would be possible if the attackers – either LuoYu or Evasive Panda – were able to compromise vulnerable devices\n[such as routers or gateways. As an antecedent, in 2019 ESET researchers discovered that the Chinese APT group known as BlackTech was](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/14/plead-malware-mitm-asus-webstorage/)\nperforming AitM attacks through compromised ASUS routers and delivering the Plead malware through ASUS WebStorage software updates.\n\n\n-----\n\nt access to S bac bo e ast uctu e t oug ega o ega ea s as e a da ou d be ab e to te cept a d ep y to t e\n[update requests performed via HTTP, or even modify packets on the fly. In April 2023, Symantec researchers reported on Evasive Panda](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/apt-attacks-telecoms-africa-mgbot)\ntargeting a telecommunications organization in Africa.\n\n**Wrap-up**\n\nUltimately, without further evidence, we cannot prove or discard one hypothesis in favor of the other, given that such capabilities are at hand\nfor Chinese APT groups.\n\n### Toolset\n\n**MgBot**\n\nMgBot is the primary Windows backdoor used by Evasive Panda, which according to our findings has existed since at least 2012 and, as\n[mentioned in this blog post, was publicly documented at VirusBulletin in 2014. It was developed in C++ with an object-oriented design, and](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2014/02/needle-haystack)\nhas the capabilities to communicate via TCP and UDP, and extend its functionality via plugin modules.\n\nMgBot’s installer and backdoor, and their functionality, have not changed significantly since it was first documented. Its chain of execution is\n[the same as described in this report by Malwarebytes from 2020.](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/07/chinese-apt-group-targets-india-and-hong-kong-using-new-variant-of-mgbot-malware)\n\n**MgBot Plugins**\n\nMgBot’s modular architecture allows it to extend its functionality by receiving and deploying modules on the compromised machine. Table 2\nlists the known plugins and their functionality. It is important to note that the plugins don’t have unique internal identification numbers;\ntherefore we are identifying them here by their DLL names on disk, which we have never seen change.\n\n_Table 2. List of plugin DLL files_\n\n**Plugin DLL name** **Overview**\n\nKstrcs.dll\n\nKeylogger.\n\nIt only actively logs keystrokes when the foreground window belongs to a process named QQ.exe and the window\ntitle matches QQEdit.

We also analyzed the plugins of the MgBot backdoor\nand found the majority of them are designed to spy on users of Chinese software by stealing credentials and information.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IoCs\n\n### Files\n\n**SHA-1** **Filename** **Detection** **Description**\n\n10FB52E4A3D5D6BDA0D22BB7C962BDE95B8DA3DD wcdbcrk.dll Win32/Agent.VFT MgBot information stealer plugin\n\nE5214AB93B3A1FC3993EF2B4AD04DFCC5400D5E2 sebasek.dll Win32/Agent.VFT MgBot file stealer plugin.\n\nD60EE17418CC4202BB57909BEC69A76BD318EEB4 kstrcs.dll Win32/Agent.VFT MgBot keylogger plugin.\n\n2AC41FFCDE6C8409153DF22872D46CD259766903 gmck.dll Win32/Agent.VFT MgBot cookie stealer plugin.\n\n0781A2B6EB656D110A3A8F60E8BCE9D407E4C4FF qmsdp.dll Win32/Agent.VFT MgBot information stealer plugin\n\n9D1ECBBE8637FED0D89FCA1AF35EA821277AD2E8 pRsm.dll Win32/Agent.VFT MgBot audio capture plugin.\n\n22532A8C8594CD8A3294E68CEB56ACCF37A613B3 cbmrpa.dll Win32/Agent.ABUJ MgBot clipboard text capture plu\n\n970BABE49945B98EFADA72B2314B25A008F75843 agentpwd.dll Win32/Agent.VFT MgBot credential stealer plugin.\n\n8A98A023164B50DEC5126EDA270D394E06A144FF maillfpassword.dll Win32/Agent.VFT MgBot credential stealer plugin.\n\n65B03630E186D9B6ADC663C313B44CA122CA2079 QQUrlMgr_QQ88_4296.exe Win32/Kryptik.HRRI MgBot installer.\n\n### Network\n\n**IP** **Provider** **First seen** **Details**\n\n122.10.88[.]226 AS55933 Cloudie Limited 2020-07-09 MgBot C&C server.\n\n122.10.90[.]12 AS55933 Cloudie Limited 2020-09-14 MgBot C&C server.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n[This table was built using version 12 of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/versions)\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nResource\nDevelopment\n\n\n[T1583.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1583/004/) Acquire Infrastructure: Server Evasive Panda acquired servers to\nbe used for C&C infrastructure.\n\n\n[T1587.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1587/001/) Develop\nCapabilities:\nMalware\n\n\nEvasive Panda develops its custom MgBot backdoor and\nplugins, including obfuscated loaders.\n\n\nExecution [T1059.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1059/003) Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell MgBot’s installer launches the\nservice from BAT files with the\ncommand net start AppMgmt\n\n[T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1106) Native API MgBot’s installer uses the CreateProcessInternalW API to\nexecute rundll32.exe to load the backdoor DLL.\n\n\n[T1569.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1569/002) System Services:\nService Execution\n\n\nMgBot is executed as a Windows service.\n\n\nPersistence [T1543.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1543/003) Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service MgBot replaces the path of the\nexisting Application Management\nservice DLL with its own.\n\n\nPrivilege\nEscalation\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\n[T1548.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1548/002) Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account\nControl\n\n\n[T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1140) Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information MgBot's installer decrypts an\nembedded CAB file that contains the\nbackdoor DLL.\n\n\nMgBot performs UAC Bypass.\n\n\n[T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1112/) Modify Registry MgBot modifies the registry for persistence.\n\n\n[T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1027/) Obfuscated Files\nor Information\n\n\nMgBot’s installer contains embedded malware files and\nencrypted strings.
