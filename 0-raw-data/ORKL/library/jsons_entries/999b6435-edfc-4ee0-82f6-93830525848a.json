DomainTools provided initial analysis of network\ninfrastructure and implications on 14 December. Since then, multiple entities have released\nreports including additional malware analysis, Command and Control (C2) identification,\nand details on the possible scope of the incident.\n\nThe following represent some of the more relevant items published as of this writing:\n\n[Dark Halo Leverages SolarWinds Compromise to Breach Organizations, Volexity.](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nAlert AA20-352, Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies,\nCritical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations, US Department of Homeland\nSecurity, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n[SunBurst: The Next Level of Stealth, ReversingLabs.](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/sunburst-the-next-level-of-stealth)\n\n\n-----\n\n[SUNBURST Backdoor: A Deeper Look into the SolarWinds Supply Chain Malware,](https://blog.prevasio.com/2020/12/sunburst-backdoor-deeper-look-into.html)\nPrevasio.\n\nBased on additional information released by multiple parties as well as independent\nDomainTools analysis, this blog adds to and updates, where applicable, previous reporting.\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\nWhile SUNBURST activity was only identified in December 2020, analysis of campaign\ndetails and further analysis of SolarWinds software indicates the event may have started, at\nleast in preparatory phases, over a year prior.\n\nWhile previous DomainTools research shows infrastructure management and staging likely\n[started in December 2019, subsequent analysis from ReversingLabs indicates that the](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/sunburst-the-next-level-of-stealth)\noperation began even earlier. Based on analysis of SolarWinds binaries, researchers at\nReversingLabs identified modifications to installer packages as early as October 2019.\n\nWhile this may appear to be an academic point for defenders aside from those remediating\nevents at SolarWinds, this detail does allow us to draw several conclusions:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The SolarWinds intrusion was a long-planned event, occurring in distinct stages:\n\nsupply chain breach, software modification testing, infrastructure development, then\nfinal deployment.\n2. Given that this campaign appears to have started no later than October 2019, the\n\nrange of possible intrusion scenarios related to this threat actor expands dramatically.\n\n[The second point is significant given reporting from Volexity—on multiple intrusions tied to](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nthe entity responsible for the SUNBURST campaign. Specifically, in several incidents the\nadversary—referred to as “Dark Halo” by Volexity - remained in victim environments\n“undetected for several years.” Based on this alarming observation, DomainTools concludes\nwith high confidence that post-instrusion activity identified with the SolarWinds supply chain\ncampaign has likely been active since prior to February 2020, and with medium confidence\nbefore October 2019—extending the timeline of investigation for potential victims far longer\nthan the March to October (or later), 2020 timeline usually cited in public reporting.\n\nVolexity’s conclusions on alternative intrusions methods are supported by recent alerting\nfrom CISA. In [AA20-352, CISA noted that they possess “evidence of additional initial](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a)\naccess vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform.” In discussions with multiple\nparties, these vectors are beyond those detailed by Volexity, and could be related to recent\n[reporting concerning a possible breach at Microsoft, discussed further below. As a result,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-cyber-microsoft/exclusive-microsoft-breached-in-suspected-russian-hack-using-solarwinds-sources-idUSKBN28R3BY)\norganizations face an extremely difficult defensive problem given the multiple potential\ningress mechanisms available to the adversary and the significant dwell time available to\nthem following breach based on available timelines and campaign duration estimates.\n\n## Additional Infrastructure Observations\n\nWhile DomainTools Iris Passive DNS (pDNS) information identified and confirmed secondstage C2 nodes provided as Canonical Name (CNAME) responses to DNS requests to the\nprimary C2 domain, avsvmcloud[.]com, additional infrastructure continues to surface linked\nto the campaign. As a reminder, the following represent the first and second stage beacon\ndomains associated with SUNBURST malicious SolarWinds Orion installer activity:\n\n**Domain** **IP** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\n\n**avsvmcloud[.]com** **[various]** **2/27/2020** **10/30/2020**\n\n**deftsecurity[.]com** **13.59.205.66** **2/14/2020** **12/13/2020**\n\n**freescanonline[.]com** **54.193.127.66** **2/11/2020** **12/13/2020**\n\n**thedoccloud[.]com** **54.215.192.52** **2/9/2020** **12/10/2020**\n\n**websitetheme[.]com** **34.203.203.23** **2/4/2020** **6/25/2020**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain** **IP** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\n\n**highdatabase[.]com** **139.99.115.204** **12/28/2019** **12/6/2020**\n\nWhile these are reasonably well known and documented, follow-on infrastructure relates to\nCobalt Strike Beacon and related post-exploitation payloads. Based on analysis from\n[FireEye, Volexity, and](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/blob/main/indicator_release/Indicator_Release_NBIs.csv) [Symantec-Broadcom, different sets of infrastructure—including](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sunburst-supply-chain-attack-solarwinds)\npotentially unique domains per victim—are used in this phase of events. As of this writing,\nDomainTools is aware of the following infrastructure linked to this campaign:\n\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider** **SSL/TLS Cer**\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Create**\n**Date** **IP**\n\n\n**databasegalore[.]com** **2019-**\n**12-14**\n\n**digitalcollege[.]org** **2019-**\n**03-24**\n\n**ervsystem[.]com** **2018-**\n**02-04**\n\n**globalnetworkissues[.]com** **2020-**\n**12-16**\n\n**incomeupdate[.]com** **2016-**\n**10-02**\n\n**infinitysoftwares[.]com** **2019-**\n**01-28**\n\n**kubecloud[.]com** **2015-**\n**04-20**\n\n**lcomputers[.]com** **2002-**\n**01-27**\n\n**panhardware[.]com** **2019-**\n**05-30**\n\n**seobundlekit[.]com** **2019-**\n**07-14**\n\n\n**5.252.177.21** **MivoCloud**\n**SR**\n\n**13.57.184.217** **Amazon**\n**Technologies**\n**Inc.**\n\n\n**3.16.81.254** **Amazon**\n**Technologies**\n**Inc**\n\n\n**d400021536d**\n\n\n**fdb879a2ce7**\n\n\n**198.12.75.112** **ColoCrossing** **0548eedb3d1**\n\n\n**18.220.219.143** **Amazon**\n**Technologies**\n**Inc.**\n\n**5.252.177.25** **MivoCloud**\n**SRL**\n\n**107.152.35.77** **ServerCheap**\n**INC**\n\n**3.87.182.149** **Amazon Data**\n**Services**\n**NoVa**\n\n**162.223.31.184** **QuickPacket**\n**LL**\n\n\n**ff883db5cb02**\n\n\n**4909da6d3c8**\n\n\n**e70b6be2940**\n\n\n**1123340c94a**\n\n\n**7f9ec0c7f7a2**\n\n\n**204.188.205.176** **SharkTech** **3418c877b4f**\n\n\n**e7f2ec0d868**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider** **SSL/TLS Cer**\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Create**\n**Date** **IP**\n\n\n**solartrackingsystem[.]net** **2009-**\n**12-05**\n\n**virtualwebdata[.]com** **2014-**\n**03-22**\n\n**webcodez[.]com** **2005-**\n**08-12**\n\n**zupertech[.]com** **2016-**\n**08-16**\n\n\n**34.219.234.13** **Amazon**\n**Technologies**\n**Inc.**\n\n**18.217.225.111** **Amazon**\n**Technologies**\n**Inc.**\n\n**45.141.152.18** **M247 Europe**\n**SRL**\n\n\n**91b9991c10b**\n\n\n**ab93a66c401**\n\n\n**2667db3592a**\n\n\n**51.89.125.18** **OVH SAS** **d33ec5d35d7**\n\n\nThe above items are similar to the primary and secondary C2 domains used as part of the\ninitial SolarWinds malicious update software, as well as other commonalities:\n\nUsing “seasoned” domains with initial registration dates typically far in advance of the\ncampaign. In most cases, it appears the adversary re-registered expired domains of\ninterest for use in the campaign.\nHosting via cloud service providers, including major platforms such as Amazon AWS.\nConsistent, although not exclusive, use of technology-related naming “themes” or\nconventions.\nUse of Sectigo-issued SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted communications mostly\nissued in 2020, well after the creation date of the domains.\n\nGiven the possibility that these third-stage C2 domains may be unique to individual victims,\ntheir use for direct defensive purposes (e.g., incorporating into block or alarm lists) is\ncircumscribed. However, focusing on the observations and commonalities of the\ninfrastructure—age, theme, hosting pattern, and significant differences between registration\nand SSL/TLS certificate timestamps—may work to identify similarly-structured\ninfrastructure.\n\nFor example, an organization could use automated lookups to a resource such as\nDomainTools to capture information about a newly-seen, unfamiliar domain in network\ntraffic. This information can then be parsed to compare registration and certificate times, or\na combination of registrar and hosting provider or Autonomous System Number (ASN) used\nto identify infrastructure linked to past malicious behaviors.\n\n## Victim Identification and Defensive Notes\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother recently-popular aspect of the SolarWinds supply chain attack is victim\nidentification through reversing the algorithm used to encode subdomains on DNS lookups\nto the primary C2 domain, avsvmcloud[.]com. Multiple entities have produced lists of both\n[raw requests (including DomainTools researchers here) and decoded lists following the](https://pastebin.com/T0SRGkWq)\n[algorithm published by Prevasio.](https://blog.prevasio.com/2020/12/sunburst-backdoor-part-ii-dga-list-of.html)\n\nWhile provocative, analysts must understand the nature of the SUNBURST infection chain\nto appropriately grasp the nature and meaning of any purported “victim list.” As shown in\nthe following diagram, while a beacon to the primary C2 domain is necessary for follow-on\nexploitation to occur, it is not sufficient given checks within the malware for network ranges\nand security products for further functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\nA victim could download the malicious package and execute it, but fail one of several\nchecks for follow-on execution resulting in an inert payload. Furthermore, even if a victim\nreceives the CNAME for follow-on C2 behaviors, it remains up to the adversary’s discretion\nas to whether that entity will receive any follow-on payloads, such as Cobalt Strike Beacon\nor other post-exploitation tools.\n\nFurthermore, there is another aspect of the “victim lists” which must be clearly called out.\nCirculated lists of “victims” are based on pDNS collection related to the primary domain,\navsvmcloud[.]com. While a number of entities, including DomainTools, work diligently to\ncollect as complete a picture of DNS queries as possible for multiple reasons, no provider\nhas a complete view into all executed DNS queries. As a result, the list is almost certainly\nincomplete. The significance of this observation is that an organization not being on the list\nof identified victims does not mean that entity did not conduct any network traffic to\ncampaign-related infrastructure - instead, that traffic may simply have been missed or not\nrecorded.\n\nRather than relying on third-party data, defenders and IT personnel should instead leverage\ninternal data sources and continuous DNS monitoring. These will be far more authoritative\nof the organization’s activity and more reliable. While third-party datasets are extremely\nuseful for research purposes, own-network defense is best augmented through visibility of\nown-network activity and traffic.\n\n## A Note on Attribution\n\nShortly after initial disclosures on intrusions into the US Treasury Department and other\n[organizations, media entities linked the events via sources to “APT29.” APT29, also](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html)\n[referred to as Cozy Bear (CrowdStrike), The Dukes (various), or](https://blog.f-secure.com/the-dukes-7-years-of-russian-cyber-espionage/) [YTTRIUM (Microsoft), has](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/12/03/analysis-of-cyberattack-on-u-s-think-tanks-non-profits-public-sector-by-unidentified-attackers/)\n[previously been associated with Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), a successor](https://www.valisluureamet.ee/pdf/raport-2018-ENG-web.pdf)\norganization to the First Chief Directorate of the Committee for State Security (KGB).\n[However, this link is neither definite nor undisputed, as other researchers and organizations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/16/russian-state-sponsored-hackers-target-covid-19-vaccine-researchers)\nhave also linked APT29 to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). Notably, the last US\n(and other) government public reporting on APT29, concerning theft of COVID-19\ninformation in summer 2020, only referred to APT29 as linked to “Russian intelligence\nservices” as opposed to a specific entity.\n\nIn the case of SolarWinds and related activity, it appears US government sources, speaking\nwith the Washington Post, linked the activity to APT29 as an alternative way of referencing\nSVR. This observation is interesting, as three entities have now reported on the activity in\nquestion without associating the identified behaviors with APT29:\n\nFireEye’s [report linked the intrusion to a new entity tracked as “UNC2452,” using the](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\ncompany’s [documented activity clustering methodology.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/how-mandiant-tracks-uncategorized-threat-actors.html)\nBoth Microsoft’s [customer blog and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/13/customers-protect-nation-state-cyberattacks/) [technical reporting did not mention a specific](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/)\nadversary responsible for events, despite previous reporting on YTTRIUM.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Volexity, which has previously published material directly attributing events to APT29,](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2016/11/09/powerduke-post-election-spear-phishing-campaigns-targeting-think-tanks-and-ngos/)\n[also linked identified activities to a new entity, similar to FireEye, only in this case](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nnamed “Dark Halo.”\n\nThe overall picture is therefore confusing, as government sources are using “APT29” for\nthis intrusion, while commercial entities that have directly responded to events are\nassociating events with different entities. While DomainTools does not engage in direct\nattribution, observations and analysis of publicly available information indicate likely\nmisunderstanding between organizations.\n\nBased on a close reading of media reporting, it appears that sources linking activity to\n“APT29” may be using this term as a catch-all for SVR activity. Meanwhile, entities\nresponding to events and with the most data at present see clear differences between the\n[current activity and legacy APT29 behaviors. If using a behavior-based attribution](https://pylos.co/2018/07/06/the-impermanence-of-things-and-attribution/)\n[methodology where naming conventions are assigned to collections of activities or](https://pylos.co/2018/06/04/naming-necessity-and-activity-group-attribution/)\nbehaviors as opposed to distinct entities (such as, “SVR”), having a separate naming\nconvention for distinct behaviors makes sense\n\nOverall, current analysis indicates that entities are almost certainly using different meanings\nfor “APT29” in this event, with certain sources equating “APT29” with “SVR” while threat\nintelligence and incident response companies view possible SVR-linked cyber activities\ndistributed among distinct groups. The one note of caution for defenders out of this\nconfusion is that, given security company tracking as “not APT29,” standard playbooks and\nassumptions on APT29 behaviors and activity are not necessarily applicable for this\ncampaign.\n\n## Defense, Mitigation, and Recovery\n\nThe identified campaign remains a difficult problem for network defenders to both identify\nwhether a breach has taken place, and to then scope the extent of such an intrusion.\nMatters have gotten even worse as there are now indications that, in addition to\nSolarWinds, [Microsoft may also have been breached as part of this activity (a claim which is](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-cyber-microsoft-int/exclusive-microsoft-breac%5B%E2%80%A6%5D-russian-hack-using-solarwinds-sources-familiar-idUSKBN28R3BW)\n[disputed as of this writing). The potential scope and risk of supply chain compromises](https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1339723696458461184)\nremains concerning and significant—but are not insurmountable.\n\nFor defenders and IT operators, recognizing that just deploying a capability within a\nmonitored environment—such as the malicious SolarWinds update—is not sufficient to\nachieve compromise. Instead, adversaries must be able to take some measure of control\nover infected devices, and be able to move laterally within the network to other sources of\nvalue for collection or other objectives. All of this activity, even if initial intrusion leapfrogs a\nlarge number of controls and monitoring points, leaves traces for detection and response.\n\n\n-----\n\nOrganizations that monitor for new, unique, or abnormal network connections can identify\nC2 communication schema. Proper asset classification which identifies specific hosts or\nhost-type (e.g., “server” instead of “end-user client”) can further differentiate communication\nto identify items of concern. Similar classification can also work to identify unusual\nauthentication activity, where servers (such as a SolarWinds Orion device) initiate logons to\nother clients instead of the reverse.\n\nOverall an emphasis on visibility, own-network understanding, and being able to correlate\nevents together to identify suspicious patterns of activity can succeed in identifying even the\nmost complex supply chain attacks post-breach. Although attackers may still gain initial\nfootholds within networks, being able to dramatically reduce adversary dwell time is a\nsignificant improvement over what many organizations impacted by this SolarWinds event\nwill experience in the coming weeks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SolarWinds breach and resulting aftershocks will continue reverberating around the\nsecurity community. When additional potential supply chain intrusions—such as that\nallegedly taking place at Microsoft—are added in, network defenders must be extremely\nvigilant in monitoring and operating their networks. While circumstances may seem dire, a\ncombination of enhanced network monitoring, own-network understanding, and enrichment\nof external observations through tools such as DomainTools Iris can work to minimize an\nadversary’s ability to evade detection, or minimize time to detection to reduce the scope of\nan incident.\n\nDomainTools will continue to analyze this event and its implications, and provide further\nobservations and recommendations as appropriate.\nRead our previous blog on the SolarWinds Supply Chain Incident.\n\n[Read More](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/unraveling-network-infrastructure-linked-to-the-solarwinds-hack?utm_campaign=continuous-eruption-further-analysis-of-the-solarwinds-supply-incident&utm_source=Blog)\n\n## The DomainTools Security Research Team Discusses Their Analysis:\n\n\n-----",
