The digital certificate is issued under the company\nname ‘Hermetica Digital Ltd’ and valid as of April 2021. At this time, we haven’t seen any\nlegitimate files signed with this certificate. It’s possible that the attackers used a shell\ncompany or appropriated a defunct company to issue this digital certificate.\n\n\n-----\n\nHermeticWiper Digital Signature\nThis is an early effort to analyze the first available sample of HermeticWiper. We recognize\nthat the situation on the ground in Ukraine is evolving rapidly and hope that we can\ncontribute our small part to the collective analysis effort.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nAt first glance, HermeticWiper appears to be a custom-written application with very few\nstandard functions. The malware sample is 114KBs in size and roughly 70% of that is\ncomposed of resources. The developers are using a tried and tested technique of wiper\nmalware, abusing a benign partition management driver, in order to carry out the more\n[damaging components of their attacks. Both the Lazarus Group (Destover) and APT33](https://operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Destructive-Malware-Report.pdf)\n[(Shamoon) took advantage of Eldos Rawdisk in order to get direct userland access to the](https://securelist.com/shamoon-the-wiper-further-details-part-ii/57784/)\nfilesystem without calling Windows APIs. HermeticWiper uses a similar technique by abusing\na different driver, `empntdrv.sys .`\n\n\n-----\n\nHermeticWiper resources containing EaseUS Partition Manager drivers\nThe copies of the driver are ms-compressed resources. The malware deploys one of these\ndepending on the OS version, bitness, and SysWow64 redirection.\n\nEaseUS driver resource selection\nThe benign EaseUS driver is abused to do a fair share of the heavy-lifting when it comes to\naccessing Physical Drives directly as well as getting partition information. This adds to the\ndifficulty of analyzing HermeticWiper, as a lot of functionality is deferred to\n```\nDeviceIoControl calls with specific IOCTLs.\n\n## MBR and Partition Corruption\n\n```\nHermeticWiper enumerates a range of Physical Drives multiple times, from 0-100. For each\nPhysical Drive, the `\\\\.\\EPMNTDRV\\ device is called for a device number.`\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then focuses on corrupting the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record (MBR)\nfor every Physical Drive. While that should be enough for the device not to boot again,\nHermeticWiper proceeds to enumerate the partitions for all possible drives.\n\nThey then differentiate between FAT and NTFS partitions. In the case of a FAT partition, the\nmalware calls the same ‘bit fiddler’ to corrupt the partition. For NTFS, the HermeticWiper\nparses the Master File Table before calling this same bit fiddling function again.\n\nMFT parsing and bit fiddling calls\nWe euphemistically refer to the bit fiddling function in the interest of brevity. Looking through\nit, we see calls to Windows APIs to acquire a cryptographic context provider and generate\nrandom bytes. It’s likely this is being used for an inlined crypto implementation and byte\noverwriting, but the mechanism isn’t entirely clear at this time.\n\nFurther functionality refers to interesting MFT fields ( $bitmap, `$logfile ) and` NTFS\nstreams ( $DATA, `$I30,` `$INDEX_ALLOCATION ). The malware also enumerates common`\nfolders (‘My Documents’, ‘Desktop’, ‘AppData’), makes references to the registry (‘ntuser’),\nand Windows Event Logs ( \"\\\\\\\\?\\\\C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\winevt\\\\Logs\" ). Our\nanalysis is ongoing to determine how this functionality is being used, but it is clear that\nhaving already corrupted the MBR and partitions for all drives, the victim system should be\ninoperable by this point of the execution.\n\nAlong the way, HermeticWiper’s more mundane operations provide us with further IOCs to\nmonitor for. These include the momentary creation of the abused driver as well as a system\nservice. It also modifies several registry keys, including setting the\n```\nSYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CrashControl CrashDumpEnabled key to 0,\n\n```\neffectively disabling crash dumps before the abused driver’s execution starts.\n\nDisabling CrashDumps via the registry\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, the malware waits on sleeping threads before initiating a system shutdown, finalizing\nthe malware’s devastating effect.\n\n## A Decoy Ransomware – PartyTicket\n\nOn February 24th, 2022, Symantec researchers pointed to a new Go ransomware being\nused as a decoy alongside the deployment of HermeticWiper. During out analysis we\ndecided to name it PartyTicket based on some of the strings used by the malware\ndevelopers:\n\nThe idea of using a ransomware as a decoy for a wiper is counterintuitive. In particular, a\nransomware as poorly coded as PartyTicket is more likely to tie up resources during the\nexecution of an otherwise efficient wiper.\n\nAs often happens to amateur Go developers, the malware has poor control over its\nconcurrent threads and the commands it attempts to run. This leads to hundreds of threads\nand events spawned in our consoles. That is to say, it’s a very loud and ineffective\nransomware that should fire alerts left and right.\n\nThe folder organization and function naming conventions within the binary show the\ndeveloper’s intent for taunting the U.S. Government and the Biden administration.\n\nProject folders and function names referring to the Biden Administration\nSimilar taunting can be found in the ransom note after execution:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn trying to understand the execution flow of PartyTicket, we see the\n```\n403forBiden.wHiteHousE.primaryElectionProcess() function recursively enumerating\n\n```\nfolders:\n\n\n-----\n\nPartyTicket looping over non-system folders\nThe resulting number of folders will be used as an upperbound for concurrent threads, a\nmistake by the Go devs as that effectively ties up all of the system’s resources. While the\nfiles found are all queued into a channel for the threads to reference.\n\nPartyTicket generating concurrent threads\nThe function indirectly called for each thread is `main.subscribeNewPartyMember() . It in`\nturn takes a filename, makes a copy with a `<UUID>.exe name and deletes the original file.`\nThen we expect a second loop to relieve that queue of files and run each through a standard\nGo AES crypto implementation. However, execution is unlikely to get this far with the current\ndesign of PartyTicket.\n\n(Thanks to Joakim Kennedy (Intezer) for pointing out this indirect call)\n\n\n-----\n\nCrypto routine for files queued in the ‘salary’ channel\nOverall our analysis of PartyTicket indicates it to be a rather simple, poorly coded, and loud\nmalware. Its possible role as a decoy ransomware deployed alongside HermeticWiper is\nmore likely to be effective for its accidental hogging of the victim organization’s system\nresources rather than the encryption of files itself. IOCs and Yara rules have been added\nbelow.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter a week of defacements and increasing DDoS attacks, the proliferation of sabotage\noperations through wiper malware is an expected and regrettable escalation. At this time, we\nhave a very small sliver of aperture into the attacks in Ukraine and subsequent spillover into\nneighboring countries and allies. If there’s a silver lining to such a difficult situation, it’s\nseeing the open collaboration between threat intel research teams, independent researchers,\nand journalists looking to get the story straight. Our thanks to the researchers at Symantec,\nESET, Stairwell, and RedCanary among others who’ve contributed samples, time, and\nexpertise.\n\n## SentinelOne Customers Protected\n\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/keWfVA6F4IM\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**(Updated February 28th, 2022)**\n\n**ms-compressed resources** **SHA1**\n\nRCDATA_DRV_X64 5ceebaf1cbb0c10b95f7edd458804a646c6f215e\n\nRCDATA_DRV_X86 0231721ef4e4519ec776ff7d1f25c937545ce9f4\n\nRCDATA_DRV_XP_X64 9c2e465e8dfdfc1c0c472e0a34a7614d796294af\n\nRCDATA_DRV_XP_X86 ee764632adedf6bb4cf4075a20b4f6a79b8f94c0\n\n**HermeticWiper** **SHA1**\n\nWin32 EXE 0d8cc992f279ec45e8b8dfd05a700ff1f0437f29\n\nWin32 EXE 61b25d11392172e587d8da3045812a66c3385451\n\nWin32 EXE 912342f1c840a42f6b74132f8a7c4ffe7d40fb77\n\nWin32 EXE 9518e4ae0862ae871cf9fb634b50b07c66a2c379\n\nWin32 EXE d9a3596af0463797df4ff25b7999184946e3bfa2\n\n\n-----\n\n**PartyTicket** **SHA-1**\n\nWin32 EXE f32d791ec9e6385a91b45942c230f52aff1626df\n\n## YARA Rules\n\n[(https://github.com/SentineLabs/Yara/blob/main/APT_RU_SunFlowerSeed.yar)](https://github.com/SentineLabs/Yara/blob/main/APT_RU_SunFlowerSeed.yar)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nimport pe \nrule MAL_HERMETIC_WIPER {\n  meta:\n   desc = \"Hermetic Wiper -
