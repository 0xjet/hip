    "plain_text": "# Popular hacking forum bans ransomware ads\n\n**[therecord.media/popular-hacking-forum-bans-ransomware-ads/](https://therecord.media/popular-hacking-forum-bans-ransomware-ads/)**\n\nMay 14, 2021\n\nOne of the most popular hacking forums on the internet today announced that it would ban\nransomware ads.\n\nThe XSS forum, previously known as DaMaGeLab, has been one of the two major places\nwhere ransomware gangs have advertised their services and hired partners to carry out\nattacks.\n\n“Lockers (ransomware) have accumulated a critical mass of nonsense, bullshit, hype, noise,”\nthe site’s admin said today in a post spotted by Recorded Future threat intelligence analyst\n[and The Record author Dmitry Smilyanets.](https://twitter.com/ddd1ms)\n\nGoing forward, the forum said it would prohibit ads for ransomware affiliate models and the\nsale or rental of ransomware strains.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: The Record\nThe XSS ransomware ban comes after a ransomware gang known as Darkside encrypted\nthe network of Colonial Pipeline in an attack that shut down a major pipeline that transported\nfuel for around 45% of the US East Coast.\n\nThe incident shone a new light on the ransomware phenomenon, which became a daily topic\nin White House national security briefings.\n\nWith most ransomware gangs operating out of Russia, and with most ransomware being\nadvertised on Russian-speaking forums, industry experts expect US authorities to crack\ndown on some of these threat actors and their enablers.\n\n[The tone appears to have been set by US President Joe Biden in a press conference on](https://therecord.media/biden-no-evidence-russian-government-is-involved-in-colonial-ransomware-attack/)\nMonday, when he said that Russia has “some responsibility to deal with this [phenomenon],”\nbefore saying that he’d also bring up the topic in future discussions with Russian President\nVladimir Putin.\n\nHowever, even before those talks could take place, the message appears to have registered\nloud and clear. In a message today, the XSS admin team decided to avoid unwanted\nscrutiny, claiming that their forum’s main purpose was always “knowledge” and not to serve\nas a marketplace for criminal gangs.\n\nTheir decision might have been hasted by the fact that the Darkside ransomware gang ran\nan ad for its affiliate program on the XSS forum, together with all the major ransomware\noperations, such as REvil, Netwalker, Gandcrab, Avaddon, and many others.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Ransomware ads still allowed on Exploit\n\nWith the XSS ban today, Smilyanets expects ransomware gangs to move their recruiting and\nadvertising operations on Exploit, another major cybercrime forum on which most gangs\nhave also been running ads like the ones they ran on XSS.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Exploit team has not made any announcement in regards to a\nransomware ad ban.\n\nBut the XSS ransomware ban today is not unique. Cybercrime forum admins have often\nbanned certain topics on their sites when they believed law enforcement might take them in\ntheir sights.\n\nFor example, in 2016, after a hacker published the source code of the Mirai DDoS botnet on\n[HackForums, the site’s admin responded by banning DDoS-for-hire service ads a few days](https://news.softpedia.com/news/the-internet-s-biggest-hacking-forum-removes-its-ddos-for-hire-section-509810.shtml)\nlater, not wanting to be in the crosshairs of an FBI investigation looking into a series of Mirai\nDDoS attacks that crippled large parts of the internet.\n\nSimilarly, when internet pranksters started hacking into Zoom meetings and recording users\nin early 2020, forums like Cracked and Nulled, where pranksters often went to organize or\n[request Zoom bombing sessions, banned the posting of any Zoom-related content on their](https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1255156787801546760)\nsites.\n\n**UPDATED on May 14, 16:30pm: A day after the XSS forum banned ransomware ads, the**\nExploit forum followed suite and also announced a similar decision. Currently, both of the two\nmajor hacking forums where ransomware ads were being posted have banned these types\nof adverts on their sites.\n\n[Another one bites the dust – forum Exploit bans #ransomware](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ransomware?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[pic.twitter.com/d4nknItz7E](https://t.co/d4nknItz7E)\n\n— 𝕯𝖒𝖎𝖙𝖗𝖞 𝕾𝖒𝖎𝖑𝖞𝖆𝖓𝖊𝖙𝖘 (@ddd1ms) [May 14, 2021](https://twitter.com/ddd1ms/status/1393299489784467458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nTags\n\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[DaMaGeLaB](https://therecord.media/tag/damagelab/)\n[Darkside](https://therecord.media/tag/darkside/)\n[forum](https://therecord.media/tag/forum/)\n[hacking forum](https://therecord.media/tag/hacking-forum/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[ransomware ad](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware-ad/)\n[XSS](https://therecord.media/tag/xss/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
