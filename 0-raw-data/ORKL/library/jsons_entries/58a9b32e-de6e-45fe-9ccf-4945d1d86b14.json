We estimate with moderate confidence that APT42 operates on behalf\nof the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)’s Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO)\nbased on targeting patterns that align with the organization’s operational mandates and\npriorities.\n\nThe full published report covers APT42’s recent and historical activity dating back to at least\n2015, the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures, targeting patterns, and elucidates\nhistorical connections to APT35. APT42 partially coincides with public reporting on TA453\n[(Proofpoint), Yellow Garuda (PwC), ITG18 (IBM X-Force), Phosphorus (Microsoft), and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/badblood-ta453-targets-us-and-israeli-medical-research-personnel-credential)\n[Charming Kitten (ClearSky and](https://www.clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town-3/) [CERTFA).](https://blog.certfa.com/posts/fake-interview-the-new-activity-of-charming-kitten/)\n\nRead the [APT42 report now, and check out our](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/reports/apt42-spear-phishing-and-surveillance) podcast for even more information on\nAPT42.\n\n## APT42 Operations\n\nAPT42 uses highly targeted spear-phishing and social engineering techniques designed to\nbuild trust and rapport with their victims in order to access their personal or corporate email\naccounts or to install Android malware on their mobile devices. In addition, APT42\ninfrequently uses Windows malware to complement their credential harvesting and\nsurveillance efforts.\n\nAPT42 operations broadly fall into three categories:\n\n**Credential harvesting: APT42 frequently targets corporate and personal email**\naccounts through highly targeted spear-phishing campaigns with enhanced emphasis\non building trust and rapport with the target before attempting to steal their credentials.\nMandiant also has indications that the group leverages credential harvesting to collect\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) codes to bypass authentication methods and has\nused compromised credentials to pursue access to the networks, devices, and\naccounts of employers, colleagues, and relatives of the initial victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Surveillance operations: As of at least late 2015, a subset of APT42 s infrastructure**\nserved as command-and-control (C2) servers for Android mobile malware designed to\ntrack locations, monitor communications, and generally surveil the activities of\nindividuals of interest to the Iranian government, including activists and dissidents\ninside Iran.\n**Malware deployment: While APT42 primarily prefers credential harvesting over**\nactivity on disk, several custom backdoors and lightweight tools complement its\narsenal. The group likely incorporates these tools into their operations when the\nobjectives extend beyond credential harvesting.\n\nMandiant has observed over 30 confirmed targeted APT42 operations spanning these\ncategories since early 2015. The total number of APT42 intrusion operations is almost\ncertainly much higher based on the group’s high operational tempo, visibility gaps caused in\npart by the group’s targeting of personal email accounts and domestically focused efforts,\nand extensive open-source industry reporting on threat clusters likely associated with\nAPT42.\n\nFigure 1: APT42 operations by category\n\n## APT42 Targeting Patterns\n\nThe targeting patterns for APT42 operations are similar to other Iranian cyber espionage\nactors, with a large segment of its activity focused on the Middle East region. However,\nunlike other suspected IRGC-affiliated cyber espionage groups that have focused on\ntargeting the defense industrial base or conducting large-scale collection of personally\nidentifiable information (PII), APT42 primarily targets organizations and individuals deemed\nopponents or enemies of the regime specifically gaining access to their personal accounts\n\n\n-----\n\nand mobile devices. The group has consistently targeted Western think tanks, researchers,\njournalists, current Western government officials, former Iranian government officials, and the\nIranian diaspora abroad.\n\nSome APT42 activity indicates the group alters its operational focus as Iran’s priorities\nevolve, to include targeted operations against the pharmaceutical sector at the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and pursuing domestic and foreign-based opposition\ngroups prior to an Iranian presidential election. This indicates that APT42 is trusted by the\nIranian government to quickly react to geopolitical changes by adjusting their flexible\noperations to targets of operational interest to Tehran.\n\nFigure 2: Countries and industries targeted directly by APT42\n\n## Potential Ties Between APT42 and Ransomware Activity\n\nMandiant further highlights open-source reporting from Microsoft claiming a connection\nbetween intrusion activity clusters that generally align with APT42 and UNC2448, an Irannexus threat actor known for widespread scanning for various vulnerabilities, the use of the\nFast Reverse Proxy tool, and reported ransomware activity using BitLocker. Notably,\nMandiant has not observed technical overlaps between APT42 and UNC2448.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In November 2021, Microsoft reported that Phosphorus had targeted Fortinet FortiOS](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/)\nSSL VPN and unpatched on-premises Exchange servers globally with the intent of\ndeploying ransomware such as BitLocker on vulnerable networks, aligning with activity\n[we track as UNC2448. Previous reporting on Phosphorus generally aligned with](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/28/cyberattacks-phosphorus-t20-munich-security-conference/)\nAPT42’s credential harvesting and spear-phishing operations.\n\nWhile Mandiant has not observed technical overlaps between APT42 and UNC2448, the\nlatter may also have ties to the IRGC-IO. We assess with moderate confidence that\nUNC2448 and the Revengers Telegram persona are operated by at least two Iranian front\ncompanies, Najee Technology and Afkar System, based on open-source information and\noperational security lapses by the threat actors. Public leaking campaigns from the Lab\nDookhtegan Telegram account further allege these companies are responsible for threat\nactivity aligned with UNC2448 and operate on behalf of the IRGC-IO.\n\nMandiant identified links between UNC2448, the Revengers persona, an individual\nnamed Ahmad Khatibi, and a likely Iranian front company named Afkar System.\nThe Revengers persona had offered data and access to primarily Israeli companies for\nsale on its Telegram channel between February and September 2021.\nAdditionally, infrastructure overlaps likely caused by human error indicate that\nUNC2448 has connections to a second front company, Najee Technology.\nPublic posts by the Lab Dookhtegan Telegram channel in July 2022 claim Afkar System\nand Najee Technology are front companies conducting cyber operations on behalf of\nthe IRGC’s Intelligence Organization.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nAPT42 activity poses a threat to foreign policy officials, commentators, and journalists,\nparticularly those in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel, working on Iranrelated projects. Additionally, the group’s surveillance activity highlights the real-world risk to\nindividual targets of APT42 operations, which include Iranian dual-nationals, former\ngovernment officials, and dissidents both inside Iran and those who previously left the\ncountry, often out of fear for their personal safety.\n\nWe do not anticipate significant changes to APT42’s operational tactics and mandate given\nthe long history of activity and imperviousness to infrastructure take downs and a media\nspotlight on operational security failures. Nevertheless, the group has displayed its ability to\nrapidly alter its operational focus as Iran’s priorities change over time with evolving domestic\nand geopolitical conditions. We assess with high confidence that APT42 will continue to\nperform cyber espionage and surveillance operations aligned with evolving Iranian\noperational intelligence collection requirements.\n\nRead the [full APT42 report today and](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/reports/apt42-spear-phishing-and-surveillance) listen to _The Defender's Advantage Podcast to learn_\nmore.\n\n\n-----",
