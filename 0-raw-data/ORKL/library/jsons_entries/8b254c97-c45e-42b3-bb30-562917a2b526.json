This adversary is best known for their\n[Dridex banking trojan, which was prolific from June 2014 through early 2020, and their](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa19-339a)\n[Bitpaymer crypter used in big game hunting (BGH) attacks beginning in 2017. The OFAC action](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/)\nconsisted of sanctions that prohibit the facilitation of significant payments to the organization,\nsuch as those involved in BGH ransom payments.\n\nIn addition to OFAC’s action against INDRIK SPIDER, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\ncharged two key members of the group — Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev — with criminal\ninfringements, and the U.S. Department of State announced a reward of up to $5 million USD\nfor any information leading to the capture or conviction of INDRIK SPIDER’s leader.\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing the OFAC sanctions and the unsealing of the indictment, INDRIK SPIDER went\nthrough significant periods of downtime and continued to develop their MO, TTPs and tradecraft\nin an attempt to evade the sanctions placed upon them — the latest evolution is Hades, which\nfirst reared its head after the OFAC action was announced.\n\n## INDRIK SPIDER’s Reaction\n\nSubsequent to the announcement of the sanctions against the group, INDRIK SPIDER\ndisappeared for a short while until reappearing in January 2020, when BitPaymer was once\nagain observed being used in a BGH operation against a victim conglomerate spanning\nmultiple verticals. This BitPaymer operation was one of the first identified examples of INDRIK\nSPIDER using a variant of Gozi ISFB as a part of their toolset instead of their Dridex banking\ntrojan.\n\nFollowing a short hiatus from March to May 2020, INDRIK SPIDER significantly increased their\nefforts to move away from their existing tools and introduced WastedLocker — the successor to\ntheir BitPaymer ransomware. Approximately six months after the OFAC sanctions and the\nunsealing of the indictment against Yakubets and Turashev, WastedLocker was used in the first\nBGH campaign, marking a new era for INDRIK SPIDER, as they also began using a variant of\nGozi ISFB in their operations. This further operational shift was highly likely an attempt to\ndistance themselves from their infamous Dridex and BitPaymer tools.\n\nIn June 2020, the trend of moving away from their typical infection chain continued, and INDRIK\nSPIDER began using fake browser updates to deliver the Cobalt Strike red-teaming tool.\n[INDRIK SPIDER extensively used Cobalt Strike to establish an initial foothold and move](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/getting-the-bacon-from-cobalt-strike-beacon/)\nlaterally within the victim network. Once control over the enterprise environment was\nestablished, WastedLocker would subsequently be executed in their BGH campaigns. INDRIK\nSPIDER continued with their usual operational tempo, infecting organizations across more than\na dozen sectors — predominantly in the U.S. — until late 2020.\n\n## WastedLocker to Hades Evolution\n\nBased on significant code overlap, CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified Hades ransomware\nas INDRIK SPIDER’s successor to WastedLocker. Hades ransomware — first publicly identified\nby [security researchers in December 2020 — was named for a Tor hidden website that victims](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1339324224029274118)\nare instructed to visit; however, Hades is merely a 64-bit compiled variant of WastedLocker with\nadditional code obfuscation and minor feature changes. The WastedLocker-derived Hades\nransomware is unrelated to a similarly named ransomware family, Hades Locker, identified by\nsecurity firms in 2016.\n\nHades ransomware shares the majority of its functionality with WastedLocker; the ISFB-inspired\nstatic configuration, multi-staged persistence/installation process, file/directory enumeration and\nencryption functionality are largely unchanged. Hades did receive minor modifications, and the\nremoved features included those that were uniquely characteristic of INDRIK SPIDER’s\n\n\n-----\n\nprevious ransomware families — WastedLocker and BitPaymer. At the time of this publication,\nCrowdStrike has identified the following changes INDRIK SPIDER made to the WastedLockerderived Hades ransomware variant:\n\nHades is now a 64-bit compiled executable with additional code-obfuscation, likely to\ndisguise the minimal changes, evade existing signature-based detections and hinder\nreverse engineering efforts.\nThe majority of standard file and registry Windows API calls were replaced with their\nsystem call counterparts (i.e., the user-mode Native APIs exported from NTDLL).\nHades employs a different User Account Control (UAC) bypass than WastedLocker;\nhowever, both implementations are taken directly from the open-source UACME project\n(https[:]//github[.]com/hfiref0x/UACME).\nHades writes a single ransom note named `HOW-TO-DECRYPT-[extension].txt to`\ntraversed directories, as opposed to WastedLocker’s and BitPaymer’s approach of\ncreating a note for each encrypted file.\nHades ransomware now stores the key information in each encrypted file rather than the\nransom note. Both WastedLocker and BitPaymer stored the encoded and encrypted key\ninformation in the file-specific ransom notes.\nWhile Hades still copies itself to a generated subdirectory in `Application Data, it no`\nlonger uses the `:bin Alternate Data Stream (ADS). The use of the` `:bin ADS path`\nwas characteristic of both WastedLocker and BitPaymer.\n\nINDRIK SPIDER’s move to this ransomware variant also came with another shift in tactics: the\ndeparture from using email communication and the possibility of exfiltrating data from victims to\nelicit payments. The Hades ransom note (shown in Figure 1) directs victims to a Tor hidden site.\nThe identified ransom notes do not identify the victim company, as was often observed with\nWastedLocker and BitPaymer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Hades ransomware (WastedLocker variant) ransom note\n\nThe Tor website (shown in Figure 2) is unique for each victim and states that data has been\nexfiltrated from their network. The only provided means of contact is a Tox-identifier for\ncommunication with the Tox peer-to-peer instant messenger (https[:]//tox[.]chat/)\n\nFigure 2. Hades ransomware (WastedLocker variant) Tor site\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSince the OFAC sanctions and DOJ indictments against the group and its members, INDRIK\nSPIDER’s continued diversification has demonstrated the group’s significant resources and\noperational resilience. INDRIK SPIDER’s ability to adapt and overcome adversity has been\nillustrated in their continual advances in their campaigns, implementation of new tools, and\nadoption of third-party products and services. The development of their tradecraft has almost\ncertainly been prompted by the legal action taken against them. The continued development of\nWastedLocker ransomware is the latest attempt by the notorious adversary to distance\nthemselves from known tooling to aid them in bypassing the sanctions imposed upon them. The\nsanctions and indictments have undoubtedly significantly impacted the group and have made it\ndifficult for INDRIK SPIDER to successfully monetize their criminal endeavors.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Description** **SHA256 Hash**\n\nHades `fe997a590a68d98f95ac0b6c994ba69c3b2ece9841277b7fecd9dfaa6f589a87`\nransomware,\nvariant of\nWastedLocker\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Read more about big game hunting adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence in_\n_[2020 in the CrowdStrike 2021 Global Threat Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/)_\n_[Check out the Global Threat Report resource hub to learn more about today’s](https://www.crowdstrike.com/global-threat-report/)_\n_adversaries._\n_To find out more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security_\n_strategy, visit the_ _[Falcon X™ Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n_Learn more about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the_\n_product webpage._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and learn how true next-gen](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
