    "plain_text": "# Russian hacker Pavel Sitnikov arrested for sharing malware source code\n\n**[therecord.media/russian-hacker-pavel-sitnikov-arrested-for-sharing-malware-source-code/](https://therecord.media/russian-hacker-pavel-sitnikov-arrested-for-sharing-malware-source-code/)**\n\nMay 31, 2021\n\nRussian authorities have detained earlier this month a popular figure on the Russian hacking\nscene on charges of distributing malicious software via his Telegram channel.\n\nPavel Sitnikov, known primarily for operating the now-suspended @Flatl1ne Twitter account\nand the Freedom F0x Telegram channel, was raided by law enforcement officials on May 20\nat his home in the town of Velikiye Luki, in the Pskov region in Eastern Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\nHe was charged the next day under Article 273, Part 2 of Russian criminal law, and forbidden\nto leave the town or use any electronic devices until his trial.\n\nSources close to Sitnikov have told Recorded Future analysts that the Russian hacker was\nallegedly charged for posting the source code of the Anubis banking trojan on Freedom F0x,\na Telegram channel where Sitnikov often posted data leaks and malware source code under\nthe pretense of helping the security community.\n\n## Suspect’s wife claims arrest is payback\n\n[But in a video interview with Russian news site Readovka, which first reported on the arrest,](https://readovka.ru/news/74576)\nSonia Sitnikov, the suspect’s wife, claimed the arrest was actually related to a post her\nhusband made on December 9, last year, when he shared a download link to the personal\ndata of more than 300,000 COVID-19 patients that registered with the Moscow Department\nof Health.\n\nPavel Sitnikov\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data, which contained names, phone numbers, addresses, and COVID-19 status,\n[sparked an outcry at the time, but Moscow officials eventually confirmed that the leak](https://www.rbc.ru/society/09/12/2020/5fd0c9fb9a7947576ce3936b)\noccurred because of a human error and not because of a malicious intrusion.\n\nNevertheless, despite high-ranking officials admitting their mistake, Sitnikov’s wife believes\nthe investigation and the Anubis-related charges are payback for publicizing the leak last\nDecember.\n\nIn an [interview with The Record last year, Sitnikov touched on the sensitive nature of leaking](https://therecord.media/an-interview-with-russian-hacker-pavel-sitnikov-there-is-no-hacking-scene-now-only-commerce/)\ndata from Russian companies, such as banks, and the reason he did it.\n\nThis data is obtained either from the banks themselves, or fraudulently by various\ncybercriminal groups or researchers. Either sold or leaked publicly. As long as the\nknowledge about the leak is hidden and not publicized, people affected by the leak\ncontinue to suffer. As soon as it is announced, the most important thing is that at least\nfor the moment those who are mentioned in the leak think about their security.\n\n_Pavel Sitnikov_\n\n## Suspect faces up to five years in prison\n\nSitnikov, who at one point claimed to have connections to Russian state-sponsored hacking\ngroup [APT28 (Fancy Bear), has a long and muddled history on the cybercrime underground.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/sofacy)\n\nA member of multiple underground hacking communities, Sitnikov previously sold and\nshared the source code of multiple malware strains, such as Carberp, Dexter, Alina, Rovnix,\nand Tinba; hence the reason why the recent charges did not surprise those who followed his\npast activity.\n\nUnder Article 273, Part 2 of Russian criminal law, Sitnikov risks up to five years in prison.\n\nTags\n\n[Anubis](https://therecord.media/tag/anubis/)\n[arrest](https://therecord.media/tag/arrest/)\n[cybercrime](https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime/)\n[data leak](https://therecord.media/tag/data-leak/)\n[hacker](https://therecord.media/tag/hacker/)\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n[Telegram](https://therecord.media/tag/telegram/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record. He previously worked at ZDNet\nand Bleeping Computer, where he became a well-known name in the industry for his\nconstant scoops on new vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, and law enforcement actions against\nhackers.\n\n\n-----",
