    "plain_text": "# Organizations in Multiple Sectors\n\nOver the last few months, the CrowdStrike Intelligence team has been tracking a campaign of highly\n\ntargeted events focused on entities in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB), healthcare, government, and\n\ntechnology sectors. This campaign infected victims with Sakula malware variants that were signed with\n\nstolen certificates. Investigation into this activity led to associations with the adversary known to\n\nCrowdStrike as DEEP PANDA.\n\nOn 31 July 2014, an executable was identified, which, at the time, was not detected by any anti-virus\n\nproducts. When this file was executed, it caused the victim to view a website by using the ShellExecute()\n\nAPI to open a URL. The site’s domain name was meant to spoof that of a site set up to provide information\n\non an alumni event for a U.S university. This page requested that the visitor download an Adobe-related\n\nplugin in order to view the content. The downloaded plugin file included a variant of Sakula malware. [1]\n\n\n-----\n\nmost commonly associated with PlugX activity. In the aforementioned university-related incidents, a\n\nlegitimate executable named MediaSoft.exe (MD5 hash: d00b3169f45e74bb22a1cd684341b14a) loaded a\n\nfile named msi.dll (MD5 hash: ae6f33f6cdc25dc4bda24b2bccff79fe), which, in turn, was used to load the\n\nSakula executable (MD5 hash: 0c2674c3a97c53082187d930efb645c2). This final executable was also\n\nsigned with a certificate assigned to an organization called DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd.\n\nCommand-and-Control (C2) communications in this incident went directly to IP address\n\n180.210.206.246; a sample GET request is below:\n\nFurther investigation revealed similar activity stretching back to at least April 2014, when similar TTPs\n\nwere used to target a healthcare organization and a U.S.-based IT company with high-profile clients in the\n\ndefense sector. Two other incidents were also identified in August 2014 targeting a company in the DIB\n\nand a Mongolian government entity.\n\nAll incidents in this campaign were similar in that they utilized malicious droppers masquerading as\n\ninstallers for legitimate software applications like Adobe Reader, Juniper VPN, and Microsoft ActiveX\n\nControl. They display progress bars that make it appear as if the specified software is being updated or\n\ninstalled.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of Installer Progress Bar Displayed by Dropper\n\nIn addition, the droppers all directed victims to login pages for services specific to the target organization\n\nlike webmail, document sharing, or corporate VPN. In all cases except one, the victims were directed to\n\nlegitimate login pages. The one exception was a case in which victims were sent to a login page hosted on a\n\ndomain that spoofed that of the legitimate one. It is unclear whether redirecting victims to these login\n\npages was part of credential-collection activity or merely meant to deceive victims into believing that the\n\nactivity was legitimate.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of a Login Page that Victims were Redirected to\n\nThe campaign appeared to be over by the end of August, but a file was recently discovered that suggests it\n\nmay be ongoing. The intended target again appeared to be a Mongolian government entity, and the file\n\nmasqueraded as an installer for Microsoft ActiveX software. It dropped the side-loaded Sakula malware\n\njust like in the other incidents; however, in this instance, the Sakula payload was signed with a certificate\n\nassigned to a different organization, Career Credit Co., Ltd. The malware used the domain www[.]xha\n_mster[.]com for C2 which was created in mid-September and is registered with the email address_\n\nwendellom@yahoo.com and registrant name “tonyy starke” (hence the name, Ironman-related title for\n\nthis blog).\n\nBelow is a chart showing the relevant relationships to this DEEP PANDA campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe bottom of the chart shows an infrastructure connection between an IP address (198.200.45.112) used\n\nthis campaign and also used in recently observed DEEP PANDA activity.\n\n**Association with Recent Scanbox Activity**\n\nIn September 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a malicious file signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co.,\n\nLtd. certificate. Analysis of this file revealed it to be Derusbi malware (a favorite RAT of DEEP PANDA)\n\nthat used the domain vpn[.]foundationssl[.]com for its C2. At the time of discovery, CrowdStrike did not\n\nattribute the file to DEEP PANDA based on the malware alone, but the use of the DTOPTOOLZ certificate\n\nto sign a malware variant known to be heavily used by this adversary makes it likely that this signed\n\nDerusbi sample is also attributable to DEEP PANDA.\n\n[In a recent public report from PWC, another foundationssl[.]com domain was linked to activity involving](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2014/10/scanbox-framework-whos-affected-and-whos-using-it-1.html)\n\nthe Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) framework more commonly known as Scanbox. In that operation,\n\nthe Scanbox code was placed on the website of a U.S.-based think tank and utilized the malicious domain,\n\n_news[.]foundationssl[.]com. The use of the two foundationssl[.]com subdomains suggests that the same_\n\nadversary (in this case DEEP PANDA) was responsible for the signed Derusbi malware file and the think\n\n[tank SWC activity. Furthermore, CrowdStrike publicly reported on DEEP PANDA targeting of think tanks](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/deep-thought-chinese-targeting-national-security-think-tanks/)\n\nin July 2014.\n\nIf you want to hear more about DEEP PANDA and their tradecraft or any of the other adversaries that\n\n\n-----\n\n[1] In February 2014, CrowdStrike publicly reported on a campaign that leveraged Sakula malware\n\n(http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/french-connection-french-aerospace-focused-cve-2014-0322-attack\nshares-similarities-2012/index.html); however, the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) between\n\nthat campaign and this recent one are different, suggesting two distinct adversaries are using the Sakula\n\nmalware.\n\n## Share this \n\n-----",
