It’s part of a broader use of diplomatic\ntools to deter cyberattacks on EU countries.\n\nSo far, the EU has not disclosed any sanctions linked to cyberattacks. The German\nsuggestion would be the first of its kind.\n\n“This would be unprecedented for the EU cyber sanction tool,” said Lukasz Olejnik, a\ncybersecurity researcher and consultant. “We would see an interesting test of the [EU’s\npackage of measures to deter cyberattacks], specifically on consensus finding,” he said. EU\nmember countries need to agree on sanctions unanimously.\n\nNational cybersecurity experts are scheduled to meet in Brussels next Wednesday, in the\nfirst meeting that could take place physically since the start of lockdown measures in Europe.\n\n### Also On POLITICO\n\n## Merkel blames Russia for ‘outrageous’ cyberattack on German parliament\n\nBy [Hans von der Burchard](https://www.politico.eu/author/hans-joachim-von-der-burchard/)\n\n\n-----\n\nMore from ...
