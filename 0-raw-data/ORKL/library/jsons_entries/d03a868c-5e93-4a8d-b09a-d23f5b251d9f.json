According to these fake\nnews, 9 banks have been affected by the attack and that money has been withdrawn\nand data stolen. SBP rejects these news. No bank, other than NBP, has faced a\ncyberattack. Further, no financial loss or data breach has been observed so far. SBP is\nmonitoring the situation closely and it will share any update or information about the\nincident through its official channels.\n\n_[State Bank of Pakistan](https://twitter.com/StateBank_Pak/status/1455185149965045767)_\n\nThe incident is currently not being investigated as a ransomware attack but rather as a\nsabotage attempt, according to people familiar with the investigation.\n\nPakistani security researcher Rafay Baloch shared a screenshot on Twitter earlier today\nclaiming to portray one of the affected NBP systems. The screenshot showed a Windows\ncomputer failing to start due to a missing boot configuration file error.\n\n_The Record was able to verify the validity of Baloch’s claim that the screenshot came from_\nNBP’s network.\n\nThe malware was pushed via privileged account in active directory which corrupted the\nboot sequence of the computers and hence prevented them from booting.
