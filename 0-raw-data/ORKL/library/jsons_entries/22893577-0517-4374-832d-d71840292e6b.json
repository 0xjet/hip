There appears to be no payment or bank\ncard details in the sales listings.\n\n### Who are the buyers?\n\nThese silos of purportedly purloined information are aimed at spammers and credential\nstuffers, which is why copies are relatively cheap to buy. The stuffers will take usernames\nand passwords leaked from one site to log into accounts on other websites where the users\nhave used the same credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, for example, someone buying the purported 500px database could decode the weaker\npasswords in the list, because some were hashed using the obsolete MD5 algorithm, and\nthen try to use the email address and cracked password combinations to log into, say,\nstrangers' Gmail or Facebook accounts, where the email address and passwords have been\nreused.\n\nAll of the databases are right now being touted separately by one hacker, who says he or\nshe typically exploited security vulnerabilities within web apps to gain remote-code execution\nand then extract user account data. The records were swiped mostly during 2018, we're told,\nand went on sale this week.\n\nThe seller, who is believed to be located outside of the US, told us the Dubsmash data has\nbeen purchased by at least one person.\n\nSome of the websites – particularly MyHeritage, MyFitnessPal, and Animoto – were known\nto have been hacked as they warned their customers last year that they had been\ncompromised, whereas the others are seemingly newly disclosed security breaches. In other\nwords, this is the first time we've heard these other sites have been allegedly hacked. This\nalso marks the first time this data, for all of the listed sites, has been peddled publicly, again if\nall the sellers' claims are true.\n\n### Is this legit?\n\nA spokesperson for MyHeritage confirmed samples from its now-for-sale database are real,\n[and were taken from its servers in October 2017, a cyber-break-in it told the world about in](https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/09/what_got_breached_this_week_ticket_portals_dna_sites_and_atlantas_police_cameras/)\n2018. ShareThis, CoffeeMeetsBagel, 8fit, 500px, DataCamp, and EyeEm also confirmed\ntheir account data was stolen from their servers and put up for sale this week in the seller's\ncollection. This lends further credibility to the data trove.\n\nLast week, half a dozen of the aforementioned sites were listed on Dream Market by the\nseller: when we spotted them, we alerted Dubsmash, Animoto, EyeEm, 8fit, Fotolog, and\n500px that their account data was potentially being touted on the dark web.\n\nOver the weekend, the underground bazaar was mostly knocked offline, apparently by a\ndistributed denial-of-service attack. On Monday this week, the underworld marketplace\nreturned to full strength, and the seller added the rest of the sites. We contacted all of them\nto alert them, and ask for a response. Meanwhile, Dream Market has been smashed offline\nagain.\n\nHere's a summary of what is, or briefly was, purported to be on sale:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dubsmash: 161,549,210 accounts for 0.549 BTC ($1,976) total**\n11GB of data taken in December 2018.

It seems likely that the perpetrator(s) of the October 2017 breach or\nsomeone who obtained the data from them is now trying to sell it. We will investigate\nthis immediately and report the attempted sale to the authorities so they can try to trace\nthe perpetrators.
