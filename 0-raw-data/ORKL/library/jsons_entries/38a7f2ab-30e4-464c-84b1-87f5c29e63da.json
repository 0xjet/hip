This malware is a clever](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/02/21/an-in-depth-analysis-of-linuxebury/)\nOpenSSH backdoor and credential stealer. Since last year, ESET’s research team has\nbeen investigating the operation behind Linux/Ebury. We discovered an infrastructure used\n\n\n-----\n\nfor malicious activities that is all hosted on compromised servers. We were also able to find\n[a link between different malicious components such as Linux/Cdorked,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/05/07/linuxcdorked-malware-lighttpd-and-nginx-web-servers-also-affected/) [Perl/Calfbot and](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Perl_Calfbot/detail)\n[Win32/Glupteba.M and realized they are all operated by the same group.](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Glupteba.M/description)\n\nToday, we are publishing the results of significant amounts of research effort in a report\ntitled “Operation Windigo – The vivisection of a large Linux server-side credential stealing\nmalware campaign”. This report details our analysis of a set of malicious programs that are\nused together to infect servers and desktop computers. We chose the name “Windigo” for\nits North American first nation roots and for its references to a malevolent half-beast.\n\n[The gang behind Operation Windigo uses infected systems to steal credentials,](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/02/21/an-in-depth-analysis-of-linuxebury/) redirect\nweb traffic to malicious content, and send spam messages. According to our analysis, over\n**25,000 servers have been affected over the last two years. More than 10,000 of them are**\n[still infected today. These servers have all been compromised with the Linux/Ebury](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/02/21/an-in-depth-analysis-of-linuxebury/)\nOpenSSH backdoor. This number is significant if you consider each of these systems have\naccess to significant bandwidth, storage, computing power and memory. Well known\n[organizations such as cPanel and](http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/CompSystem) [kernel.org were on the list of victims, although they have](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/blogs/browse/2011/08/cracking-kernelorg)\nnow cleaned their systems.\n\nThe infected servers are used to redirect half of a million web visitors to malicious content\non a daily basis. Our research also shows that the attacker is able to send more than\n35,000,000 spam messages per day with his current infrastructure. Operating systems\naffected by the spam component include Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OS X, and even\nWindows (with Perl running under Cygwin).\n\nDuring the course of our analysis, we have had the opportunity to collaborate with various\n[international organizations, including CERT ‑Bund, the](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/IT-Crisis-Management/Cert-Bund/cert-bund_node.html) Swedish National Infrastructure for\nComputing, the [European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and others forming](http://home.web.cern.ch/about)\nan international Working Group. With the help of the working group, thousands of victims\nhave been notified that their servers were infected, in an effort to clean as many systems as\npossible. We are now releasing a complete white paper in hopes of raising awareness\naround Operation Windigo and motivating administrators to clean up their compromised\nservers.\n\nWe have been working hard to prepare this report. First of all because the threats we have\nanalyzed are complex and stealthy. Secondly, because we have accumulated massive\namounts of data, ranging from traffic capture to malicious URLs and binaries. Lastly,\nbecause we wanted to provide extensive guidance to help system administrators and\nnetwork operators determine if servers are compromised and what can be done about it.\nWe hope you enjoy reading our report as much as we enjoyed putting it together.\n\n18 Mar 2014 - 01:30PM\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
