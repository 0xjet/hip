The focus is on various pieces of the attack and less about capturing the end-to-end cycle of compromise, data theft, illicit sale and use. The full scope of attacker activity traditionally occurs beyond the view of any one group of investigators. Incident response teams may\n\n have visibility into the technical aspects of the breach itself, while cyber crime researchers monitor the movement and sale of stolen data in the criminal underground.\n\n FireEye Threat Intelligence and iSIGHT Partners recently combined our research to illuminate the activities of one particular threat group: FIN6. This combined insight has provided unique and extensive visibility into FIN6’s operations, from initial intrusion to the methods used to navigate the victims’ networks to the sale of the stolen payment card data in an underground marketplace. In this report, we describe FIN6’s activities and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and provide a glimpse into the criminal ecosystem that supports the “payoff” for their operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### FIN6\n\n###### FIN6 is a cyber criminal group intent on stealing payment card data FIREEYE INTELLIGENCE TRACKS\n\ntargeted Financial threats (known as\n\n###### for monetization.

We\ntypically differentiate between threat actors who indiscriminately\ndistribute malware and threat actors who use malware selectively.\nGRABNEW itself is a credential-stealing backdoor with form-grabbing\ncapabilities and the ability to inject code into specific web pages to,\nfor example, mimic a valid login prompt for a financial institution to\nfacilitate banking fraud. In some cases, the presence of GRABNEW\n\nmalware has overlapped with the spread of POS malware such as\n\nPoSeidon, a variant of the Backoff POS malware.\n\n\n## GAININGACCESS\n\n###### INDISCRIMINATE OR INTENTIONAL?\n\n\nt’s not entirely clear how FIN6 initially compromises\nvictims. In Mandiant’s investigations, FIN6 already\npossessed valid credentials to each victim network\n\n### I\n\nand used those credentials to initiate further intrusion\nactivity.[1] In one case, GRABNEW malware was found on a\nvictim computer that FIN6 later used in its operations. We\nsuspect that the computer was originally compromised with\nGRABNEW by a separate threat actor, who used GRABNEW\nto capture valid user credentials. FIN6 may have obtained\nthose credentials (through purchase or trade) and used them\nfor its operations.\n\n\nFIN6’s use of GRABNEW, or credentials collected by\nGRABNEW, is not altogether surprising and possibly\npoints to a cyber crime support ecosystem that opens\ndoors to threat actors capable of lateral movement\nand more damaging activities. Previously, we observed\nanother FIN group — FIN2 — leverage several existing\nCitadel compromises to deploy their custom tools\nand expand within a network to compromise payment\ncard systems. Likewise, Proofpoint recently observed\nGRABNEW variants leading to downloads of POS\nmalware known as AbaddonPOS.\n\n\n1 When investigating an intrusion, it may be challenging to determine the initial method of compromise — the means through which a threat group\n\n\nfirst gained access to a victim network. While in some cases evidence may point to a spear-phishing attack or exploit execution, in other cases little\nto no forensic evidence of the original compromise remains.\n\n\n-----\n\n|ADDITIONAL DATA|DISCRETIONARY DATA|\n|---|---|\n|No. of Characters Expiration Date (YY/MM) 4 Service Code 3||\n\n\n###### After locating POS systems within the target’s environment, FIN6 deployed POS malware that we call TRINITY.\n\n**ADDITIONAL DATA** **DISCRETIONARY DATA** **ES** **LRC**\n\nNo. of No. of\nCharacters Characters\n\nExpiration Date (YY/MM) 4\nService Code 3\n\n## FIN6\n\n###### GETTING THE JOB DONE\n\nll threat groups generally follow a broad and control (CnC) servers and download and\noperational framework known as the execute shellcode.

Similarly, FIN6 used at of Metasploit-related tools, FIN6 also used\nleast two downloaders called HARDTACK and Metasploit’s PsExec NTDSGRAB module\nSHIPBREAD (apparent variations on Metasploit to obtain a copy of the Active Directory\npayloads) to establish backdoor access to the database (ntds.dit).

Both of these tools allow them to extract password hashes from\nare configured to connect to remote command the file and crack them offline.\n\n2 These vulnerabilities have all been patched by Microsoft; Windows systems with up-to-date software and security\n\npatches should not be exploitable.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to collecting credentials, FIN6\nused publicly available tools to map the\ninternal network and conduct reconnaissance\nagainst Active Directory, Structured Query\nLanguage (SQL) servers and NetBIOS. In\nparticular, during the reconnaissance phase\nthey gathered information on systems running\nSQL instances, dumping schemas for multiple\ndatabases and SQL user accounts. Specific\ntools used by FIN6 included Microsoft’s\nbuilt-in SQL querying tool (osql.exe), Query\nExpress (a free, portable graphical SQL\nclient capable of connecting to Microsoft\nSQL and Oracle databases) and AdFind, a\nfree command-line tool for querying Active\nDirectory. Over the course of one day, for\nexample, the group targeted more than\n900 SQL servers to dump reconnaissance\ninformation to support further operations.\n\nCapitalizing on the acquired reconnaissance\ndata, FIN6 began lateral movement using\ncredentials stolen from various systems on\nwhich they gathered usernames and password\nhashes. They likely cracked these hashes\noutside of the target’s network before using\nmultiple sets of domain admin credentials in\ncombination with remote command execution\ntools such as PsExec and Remote Command\nExecutor (RemCom) throughout the rest of\nthe lateral movement phase.\n\nTo maintain presence and support interactive\naccess in the environment, FIN6 leveraged the\npublicly available Plink command-line utility\n(part of the PuTTY SSH and Telnet suite) to\ncreate SSH tunnels to CnC servers under their\ncontrol. As shown in Figure 2, they used these\nSSH tunnels to route Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP) traffic and allow for interactive RDP\nsessions with systems in the target network.\n\nAfter locating POS systems within the\ntarget’s environment, FIN6 deployed POS\nmalware that we call TRINITY (also known\nas FrameworkPOS), with Scheduled Tasks\nbeing used for persistence. TRINITY runs\n\n\ncontinuously and targets system processes not\nlisted in its accompanying process blacklist,\nseeking data that matches payment card\ntrack data. Once the malware identifies track\ndata, it copies and encodes it to a local file in\na subdirectory of the c:\\windows\\ directory\nwhile attempting to conceal these files with\n.dll or .chm extensions. In one particular\ncase — and as an example of scale — FIN6\ncompromised and deployed TRINITY on\naround 2,000 systems, resulting in millions\nof exposed cards.\n\n\nFinally, to move the stolen payment card\ndata out of the environment, FIN6 used a\nscript to systematically iterate through a list\nof compromised POS systems, copying the\nharvested track data files to a numbered\n“log” file before removing the original data\nfiles. They then compressed the log files into\na ZIP archive and moved the archive through\nthe environment to an intermediary system\nand then to a staging system. From the\nstaging system, they then copied the stolen\ndata to external CnC servers under their\ncontrol using the FTP command line utility.\nIn another case, FIN6 used an alternative\nextraction method to upload payment card\ndata to a public file sharing service.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 2: NETWORK DIAGRAM SHOWING FIN6 PLINK SSH TUNNEL USED TO ROUTE RDP TRAFFIC TO VICTIM COMPUTERS**\n\nATTACKER\nCnC SERVER\n\nATTACKER\nCnC SERVER\n\nATTACKER\nCnC SERVER\n\nPLINK RDP\nTUNNEL TUNNEL\n\nVICTIM 1 RDP VICTIM 2\nHOST\n\nVICTIM 3\n\nVICTIM 4\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Our analysis of the data sold through this underground vendor indicates that FIN6’s compromises are highly profitable to the actors involved, potentially resulting in extensive fraud losses.\n\n## UNDERGROUND CARD SHOPS\n\n###### FOLLOWING THE MONEY\n\nsing iSIGHT Partners’ collected stolen by FIN6 has almost certainly ended up in\nintelligence, we discovered that the the hands of fraud operators across the world,\nstolen payment card data from these as they buy and exploit payment cards from\n\n### U\n\nintrusions were sold in an underground card the underground shop.

Along with the\n\ndata we have linked to FIN6, this underground\n\nWe have identified stolen data from several of shop has sold data from millions of other cards,\nFIN6’s victims being sold by this vendor as far which may be linked to breaches perpetrated\nback as 2014. This connection means that data by other threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur analysis of the data sold through this\nunderground vendor indicates that FIN6’s\ncompromises are highly profitable to the actors\ninvolved, potentially resulting in extensive fraud\nlosses. For instance, in one FIN6-linked breach\nthe vendor was advertising nearly than 20\nmillion cards. These cards were predominantly\nfrom the United States and selling for an\naverage of $21. So the total return for the shop\n— if all the data was sold at full price — could\nhave been about $400 million.\n\nIn reality, the shop would typically only make\na fraction of this figure since not all the data\nwould be sold (laundering stolen cards is\ntypically much harder than stealing them),\nbuyers want the newest data they can get (data\nthat has been on the shop for a while loses its\nvalue) and the shop offers discounts based\non various criteria. Still, a fraction of $400\nmillion is a significant sum. In turn, cyber\n\n\ncriminals purchasing the data would expect\nto make more than they paid for the cards\nby conducting fraudulent transactions using\nthose cards.\n\nNot all of the data sold on this particular card\nshop has been tied to an identified compromise\nor specific cyber criminal group. Additionally, as\nis often the case with prominent cyber criminal\nvendors, it is not yet clear how the operators\nof the underground site are linked to the actors\nwho steal the data the shop sells. The vendor\nhas sold large amounts of card data with\nvaried characteristics, so it is possible the shop\noperators maintain relationships with more\nthan one data provider. FIN6 members could\ninclude some of the operators behind this shop;\nalternately, FIN6 could be selling stolen data to\nthe operators of this site.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CONCLUSION\n\nood threat intelligence comes from The story of FIN6 shows how real-world threat\na combination of factors. It requires actors operate, providing a glimpse not only\nvisibility into the threat landscape, into the technical details of the compromise,\n\n### G\n\nincluding both a broad view (the ability to but also into the human factor as well; namely,\nidentify activity across a range of countries, the interactions between different criminals\nindustries and organizations) and a deep view or criminal groups, and how it is not just data\n(the ability to gather detailed information being bartered or sold in the underground, but\nabout how threat actors operate). It also also tools, credentials and access.\nrequires skilled analysts who are able to\nreview, fuse and understand the available data.\n\nIn this case, the combined intelligence from\nFireEye, Mandiant and iSIGHT intelligence\nteams was able to not only identify malicious\nactivity aimed at stealing payment card\ndata, but also provide a detailed window\ninto that activity from compromise through\nmonetization of the stolen data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### To download this or other\n FireEye Threat Intelligence reports, visit: www.fireeye.com/reports.html\n\n**FireEye, Inc.**\n1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035\n[408.321.6300 / 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) / info@FireEye.com](mailto:info%40FireEye.com?subject=)\n\n**[www.FireEye.com](http://www.FireEye.com)**\n\n\n-----",
