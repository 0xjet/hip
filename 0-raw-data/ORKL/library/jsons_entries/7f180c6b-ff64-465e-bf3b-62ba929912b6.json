The variant observed by Unit 42 is unique in that it\ncontains a change to its core source code: the replacement of its trademark word “PLUG” to “THOR.” The earliest THOR sample\n\n\n-----\n\nuncovered was from August 2019, and it is the earliest known instance of the rebranded code. New features were observed in this\nvariant, including enhanced payload-delivery mechanisms and abuse of trusted binaries.\n\n[First discovered in 2008, PlugX is a second-stage implant that’s been used by Chinese cyberespionage group PKPLUG (aka Mustang](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pkplug_chinese_cyber_espionage_group_attacking_asia/)\nPanda) and other groups. In addition to being used in multiple high-profile attacks over the years, including the significant U.S.\nGovernment Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach in 2015, PlugX is also known for its modularity and plug-in-style approach\nto malware development.\n\nAdditional hunting and analysis led to the identification of several more samples along with an associated PlugX command and control\n(C2) infrastructure. This blog provides a technical overview of the PlugX variant discovered, indicators of compromise (IOCs) to identify\nit in networks and a tool developed by Unit 42 to handle payload decryption.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from PlugX with Cortex XDR or the Next-Generation Firewall with WildFire and Threat](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n[Prevention security subscriptions.

Full visualization of the techniques observed and their relevant courses of action can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM\nViewer.\n\n## PlugX Delivery\n\nOn March 19, 2021, attackers were observed exploiting an Exchange Server via a chain of zero-days (CVE-2021-26855 and CVE-2021[27065), known as ProxyLogon, originating from IP 101.36.120[.]227. Upon successful exploitation, a webshell was uploaded to a](https://proxylogon.com/)\npublicly accessible web directory, allowing code execution at the highest privilege level.\n\n[The attackers then used a technique known as “living off the land,” which uses trusted binaries to bypass antivirus detection. In this](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/09/27/out-of-sight-but-not-invisible-defeating-fileless-malware-with-behavior-monitoring-amsi-and-next-gen-av/)\ncase, the Microsoft Windows binary bitsadmin.exe was used to download an innocuous file named Aro.dat (SHA256:\n59BA902871E98934C054649CA582E2A01707998ACC78B2570FEF43DBD10F7B6F) from an actor-controlled GitHub repo to the\ntarget. (See Figure 1 for the download command executed.)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Bitsadmin command example.\n\n## Aro.Dat: Overview\n\nThe first one thousand bytes of Aro.dat (see Figure 2) indicate the file might be encrypted or possibly compressed. As it turns out, this\ndata is nothing but random padding data likely added as a file header to evade AV signatures to thwart detection. The end of the filler\ndata is null-terminated, which provides an identifier to the actual data entry point. Immediately following the NULL byte (0x00) is a set\nof x86 assembly instructions to unpack the file. In this sample, the x86 assembly starts at file offset 0x4EC with opcode 0x77. This\ntranslates to assembly mnemonic of JA (jump if above unsigned).\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the Aro.dat file header up until the NULL byte. The data was truncated for brevity, as the bytes up until the NULL\nare meaningless. Red denotes the NULL byte, and green is where code execution begins.\n\n0000h: 49 79 7A 45 48 4C 4B 78 75 77 55 48 66 77 46 65 IyzEHLKxuwUHfwFe\n\n0010h: 6C 46 44 6D 6D 55 6E 42 50 47 76 63 70 75 68 50 lFDmmUnBPGvcpuhP\n\n0020h: 78 57 5A 67 45 48 62 66 4A 45 57 53 76 74 44 6E xWZgEHbfJEWSvtDn\n\n0030h: 75 61 75 72 56 4C 63 77 41 79 44 58 6A 72 6E 69 uaurVLcwAyDXjrni\n\n0040h: 6F 74 70 77 67 73 71 52 67 7A 4D 64 50 6D 46 6A otpwgsqRgzMdPmFj\n\n0050h: 5A 4E 64 6F 70 72 50 77 70 68 6C 42 6E 6E 56 43 ZNdoprPwphlBnnVC\n\n0060h: 79 6B 52 45 59 6B 75 50 61 75 63 56 54 55 73 51 ykREYkuPaucVTUsQ\n\n\n-----\n\n0070h: 68 73 41 4A 4E 7A 4F 49 61 51 75 4D 46 6C 54 42 hsAJNzOIaQuMFlTB\n\n0080h: 77 42 44 6B 4A 55 76 43 6C 51 47 68 46 66 69 56 wBDkJUvClQGhFfiV\n\n0090h: 66 62 6A 4C 46 77 78 41 68 50 67 44 46 6F 47 44 fbjLFwxAhPgDFoGD\n\n**.**\n\n**.**\n\n**.**\n\n**.**\n\n**.**\n\n04B0h: 37 35 38 37 35 35 30 39 37 38 32 36 39 30 33 36 7587550978269036\n\n04C0h: 39 39 33 32 33 32 36 38 39 36 33 30 35 35 39 30 9932326896305590\n\n04D0h: 37 35 35 35 37 39 35 32 39 38 30 32 33 35 38 33 7555795298023583\n\n04E0h: 30 36 32 37 36 36 30 32 35 37 36 00 77 06 81 EE 06276602576.w.\n\n_Figure 2. Aro.dat file header_\n\nAro.dat is designed to remain undetected and cannot run without the aid of a specific loader. As with previous PlugX variants, code\n[execution is achieved via a technique known as DLL side loading. Static analysis reveals that once loaded into memory, Aro.dat begins to](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\nunpack itself and initiates communication with a C2 server.\n\nAro.dat is, in fact, an encrypted and compressed PlugX payload. The decryption routine within Aro.dat closely resembles that of older\nPlugX variants (see Figure 3 below) in that it involves multiple decryption keys and bit shift operations. Once decrypted, it gets\ndecompressed via the Windows API RtlDecompressBuffer into a Windows module (DLL). The compression algorithm is LZ\ncompression (COMPRESSION_FORMAT_LZNT1).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Comparison of PlugX decryption routines\n\nThe highlighted entries shown in Figure 3 are the static decryption keys used by Aro.dat and an older 2012 PlugX sample (SHA256:\nA68CA9D35D26505A83C92202B0220F7BB8F615BC1E8D4E2266AADDB0DFE7BD15). The decryption routine differs slightly with\neach PlugX build by using different static keys and varying the use of addition and subtraction.\n\nThe decrypted, decompressed Aro.dat is an x86 Windows DLL or PE file.\n\n## Aro.Dat: Code Execution\n\nThe Aro.dat file contains the following string names: aross.dll, aro.exe and aro.dat. The association of these three files together provides\ninsight into how code execution is likely achieved. VirusTotal has the following files:\n\nAro.exe (SHA256: 18A98C2D905A1DA1D9D855E86866921E543F4BF8621FAEA05EB14D8E5B23B60C)\nAross.dll (SHA256: 9FFFB3894B008D5A54343CCF8395A47ACFE953394FFFE2C58550E444FF20EC47)\n\n[Open-source research suggests Aro.exe is part of the “ARO 2012 advanced repair and optimization tool.” It is a freely available tool that](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/5277-aro.html)\nclaims to fix Windows registry errors. It is digitally signed, has known associations with a PlugX loader and dynamically loads Aross.dll.\nAross.dll is the actor’s DLL file that is responsible for loading the encrypted payload file, Aro.dat. With this information, we can infer\n\n\n-----\n\nthat these two files are necessary and responsible for loading the encrypted THOR payload, Aro.dat.\n\nSee Figure 4 for an illustration of how code execution is achieved.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. DLL sideloading overview for Aro.dat\n\n\n## Aro Dat: Runtime Operation\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the decrypted payload runs in memory, it exhibits the same behaviors as previous PlugX implant variants. It starts by decrypting\nthe embedded PlugX hardcoded configuration settings. The decryption algorithm and XOR keys are fairly consistent across multiple\n[PlugX implants. Code behavior closely resembles that of the RedDelta PlugX that’s been reported by Insikt Group. One noticeable](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations/)\ndifference with this sample compared to all the other known PlugX malware families is the magic number check performed during the\ninitialization of the PlugX plugins. Historically, that number has always been 0x504C5547, which corresponds to the PLUG value in\nASCII encoding. In this sample, the magic number is 0x54484F52, corresponding to the THOR value in ASCII encoding.\n\nFigure 5 below illustrates the differences.\n\nFigure 5. DLL PlugX magic number comparison\n\nThe hardcoded PlugX configuration settings within the sample decoded to the following values (truncated):\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6.

The\nimplant expects 16 bytes of data for the return and, depending on the return value (command), will initiate HTTP communication.\nThe PlugX SxWorkProc thread is responsible for handling HTTP communications. An example HTTP header:\n\nFigure 8.

As such, the specific\ncomponent responsible for loading and decrypting the module is unknown. However, the connection from it to rainydaysweb[.]com is\nshown in the blue oval shape in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12.

This sample also\nshares some behavioral characteristics with other PlugX samples, namely registry activity specific to the creation of the key,\nHKLM\\Software\\CLASSES\\ms-pu\\PROXY[2]. Some of those samples make use of the C2 infrastructure linked to PKPLUG activity in\nthe past, such as PlugX sample (SHA256: A15FED60E69EC07BFD01A23BEEC2C8E9B14AD457EA052BA29BD7A7B806AB63B4)[3]\nfrom late 2020 using C2 manager2013[.]com.\n\nOther samples from the set using the common registry key, through the use of shared infrastructure, reveal further samples containing\nC2 communication information relating to the third-level domain, upload.ukbbcnews[.]com[4]. This domain is not and has never been a\nlegitimate BBC domain and was registered to appear as such to victims. This domain resolved to IPv4 address 45.248.87[.]217 up until\nApril 12, 2021, providing the C2 channel for PlugX sample (SHA256:\n690C488A9902978F2EF05AA23D21F4FA30A52DD9D11191F9B49667CD08618D87)[5] with its THOR module mpsvc.ui (SHA256:\n64E2FE0E9D52812D2DA956B1D92B51E7C215E579241649316CF996F9721E466E) from early August 2020.\n\nOther \"ukbbcnews\" third-level domains (i.e. bbc., news. and www.)existed and resolved to the same 45.248.87[.]217 IPv4 address from\nas far back as May 2019 through March 2021. In 2018, the same third-level domains resolved to some IPv4 addresses in the 134835 ASN\nrange, including 185.239.226[.]65, 185.239.226[.]76 and 185.239.226[.]14, which have been used as C2 channels for various PlugX\nsamples, seemingly throughout 2018, 2019 and 2020. PlugX sample (SHA256:\n3CDD33DEA12F21A4F222EB060E1E8CA8A20D5F6CA0FD849715F125B973F3A257)[6] from June 2018 shares behavioral traits,\nnamely setting the value of registry key HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\KET.FAST\\CLSID[7] to -1, with two other PlugX samples over the\nlast three years.\n\n\n-----\n\nOut of the set of three such PlugX samples known to Unit 42 that changed the value of that registry key, one sample (SHA256:\nA9511CDAA96ED59DE73A7A7C7DC375DE204BEE7A9511C5EE71BF013010324A91)[8] existed around the same timeframe (June\n2018) using the domain tibetsl[.]com and many third-level domains from it for C2 communication. The third PlugX sample, (SHA256:\n80DEED939A520696968335D1BB2A9FCCE7053C0156F679BA261824D0A2D44967)[9], from the set also used the THOR identifier.\nFrom November 2019, this sample and its configuration module aross.dat (SHA256:\nC5DCD3073904FAD5D9A8FE1026141A832E05C9CA03A88FEE96587921F42773D4) used 108.61.182[.]34 for its C2 communication,\nwhich resolved to the indonesiaport[.]info[10] domain between September 2019 and February 2020. The same domain has been used\nfor C2 communications by several other PlugX samples (using the PLUG identifier) that Unit 42 tracks as related to PKPLUG, dating as\nfar back as August 2017.\n\nAnother configuration module using the THOR identifier, acrobat.chm (SHA256:\nB5C0DB62184325FFBE2B8EF7E6F13F5D5926DEAC331EF6D542C5FA50144E0280)[11] loaded by PlugX sample Acrobat.dll\n(SHA256: 3C5E2A4AFE58634F45C48F4E800DC56BAE3907DDE308FF97740E9CD5684D1C53) was first seen at the end of October\n2020. The C2 channel from the configuration is tools.scbbgroup[.]com, which at the time resolved to 167.88.180[.]131, and since early\nFebruary 2021, it continues to resolve to 103.85.24[.]158 under the ASNs 6134 and 134835, respectively[12]. Other known PKPLUG\ninfrastructure using additional IP addresses from the range under both ASNs are tracked by Unit 42 and other vendors.\n\nExamples include www.ixiaoyver[.]com and www.systeminfor[.]com that resolved in April and May 2020 respectively to\n103.85.24[.]190, which acted as C2 channels for several PlugX samples (using the PLUG identifier).\n\nShortly after the brief, two-day period when www.systeminfor[.]com resolved to 103.85.24[.]190, the resolution briefly changed to\n167.88.180[.]32 (ASN 6134), which other PKPLUG-related domains resolved to throughout the course of 2020. One such domain was\nwww.cabsecnow[.]com, which was used as a C2 channel for another PlugX sample (SHA256:\nA9CBCE007A7467BA1394EED32B9C1774AD09A9A9FB74EB2CCC584749273FAC01)[13] and configuration module Smadav.dat\n(SHA256: E2D21B5E34189FA1ACA39A13A405C792B19B6EDF020907FB9840AF1AAFBAA2F4) using the THOR magic bytes in\nAugust 2020.\n\nThe final PlugX sample using the THOR identifier [14] is SmadHook32.dll (SHA256:\n125FDF108DC1AD6F572CBDDE74B0C7FA938A9ADCE0CC80CB5CE00F1C030B0C93) and its configuration module Smadav.dat\n(SHA256: CC1AFB373F8286C08869CD786FEE75B8002DF595586E00255F52892016FD7A4F) is the most recent THOR sample Unit\n\n\n-----\n\n42 has discovered. First seen in March 2021, this sample's C2 references news.cqpeizi[.]com, which since late 2019 resolves to the\nloopback address 127.0.0[.]1.\n\n## PlugX: The Hunt for Others\n\nWith an understanding of how the encrypted payload files are constructed, Unit 42 researchers created a signature based on the x86\nassembly instructions. These instructions are used to unpack the payload. (See Table 2 for a list of files discovered.)\n\nDuring our research, we discovered other PlugX-encrypted payloads that have a different encoding scheme and file header. These\nsamples are XOR encoded with the decryption key consisting of the bytes starting at file offset zero, up until the NULL byte. Typically,\nthe key is 10 bytes in length. Once decrypted, the sample is that of a PE file (DLL). (Reference Table 3 for a list of files uncovered that\nfollow this format.)\n\nWe’ve identified two other PlugX-encrypted payload files with different encoding schemes. These files were manually decrypted and\nconfirmed to be PlugX variants. (See Table 4.)\n\n## Unit 42 PlugX Payload Decrypter\n\nUnit 42 created a Python script that can decrypt and unpack encrypted PlugX payloads without having the associated PlugX loaders. It\nattempts to detect the type of PlugX-encrypted samples and then outputs the following:\n\n1. Decrypted and decompressed PlugX module (DLL). Adds an MZ header to the file as the MZ header is not present in the in\nmemory module. It only applies to encrypted payloads that have the random byte header (THOR payloads).\n2. Hardcoded PlugX configuration file (C2 information), if supported.\n\nExample of the tool in action:\n\n\n-----\n\n[The decryptor tool is hosted on Unit 42’s public tools GitHub repository.](https://github.com/pan-unit42/public_tools/tree/master/DecryptPlugX)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThirteen years after its initial discovery, the PlugX malware family remains a threat. After 10+ years of consistent source code\ncomponents, the developers made an unexpected change to its signature magic value from “PLUG” to “THOR.” New features were\nobserved in this variant, including enhanced payload delivery mechanisms and abuse of trusted binaries. With the THOR identifier\nsignature, Unit 42 will continue to search for additional samples and variants that may be associated with this new PlugX variant.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from PlugX with Cortex XDR or the Next-Generation Firewall with WildFire and Threat](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n[Prevention security subscriptions.
