    "plain_text": "# Threat in your browser: what dangers innocent-looking extensions hold for users\n\n**securelist.com/threat-in-your-browser-extensions/107181**\n\nAuthors\n\nKaspersky\n\nWhether you want to block ads, keep a to-do list or check your spelling, browser extensions allow you to do all of the\nabove and more, improving convenience, productivity and efficiency for free, which is why they are so popular. Chrome,\nSafari, Mozilla — these and many other major Web browsers — have their own online stores to distribute thousands of\nextensions, and the most popular plug-ins there reach over 10 million users. However, extensions are not always as\nsecure as you might think — even innocent-looking adds-on can be a real risk.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Browser add ons are in demand among people of different ages. For example, children can add virtual pets to_**\n**_their browser, while adults usually prefer productivity trackers and timers_**\n\nFirst of all, not every innocent-looking extension is, in fact, innocent. Malicious and unwanted add-ons promote themselves\nas useful, and often do have legitimate functions implemented along with illegitimate ones. Some of them may even\nimpersonate a popular legitimate extension, their developers going so far as to stuff keywords so that their extension\nappears near the top of the browser’s extension store.\n\n[Malicious and unwanted add-ons are often distributed through official marketplaces. In 2020, Google removed 106](https://threatpost.com/google-yanks-106-malicious-chrome-extensions/156731/)\nbrowser extensions from its Chrome Web Store. All of them were used to siphon off sensitive user data, such as cookies\nand passwords, and even take screenshots; in total, these malicious extensions were downloaded 32 million times.\nVictims of these attacks were not only individuals, but also businesses. Overall, more than 100 networks were abused,\ngiving threat actors a foothold on financial service firms, oil and gas companies, the healthcare and pharmaceutical\nindustries, government and other organizations. Another malicious Google Chrome extension that was available for\ndownload even in the official store [could recognize and steal payment card details entered in web forms. Google deleted it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chrome-extension-that-steals-card-numbers-still-available-on-web-store/)\nfrom the Chrome Web Store, but the malware had already infected more than 400 Chrome users, putting their data at\nhuge risk.\n\nSometimes the user can assess the risks by looking at what permissions an extension requests when installed from the\nstore. If you see that an add-on is asking for far more permissions than it theoretically needs, that’s a serious cause for\nconcern. For example, if a regular browser calculator requires access to your geolocation or browsing history, or wants to\ntake screenshots of pages, it’s better not to download it at all.\n\nHowever, analyzing extension permissions may not always help. Often the wording provided by browsers is so vague that\nit is impossible to tell exactly how secure an extension is. For example, basic extensions often require permission to “read\nand change all your data on the websites you visit.” They may really need it to function properly, but this permission\npotentially gives them large power.\n\nEven if extensions have no malicious functionalities, they can still be dangerous. The danger arises from the fact that\nmany extensions, after gaining access to “read all the data on all websites,” collect massive amounts of data from web\n[pages users visit. To earn more money, some developers may pass it on to third parties or sell it to advertisers. The](https://www.pcworld.com/article/410966/web-of-trust-browser-extensions-yanked-after-proving-untrustworthy.html)\nproblem is that sometimes that data is not anonymized enough, so even non-malicious extensions can harm users by\nexposing their data to someone who is not supposed to see what websites they visit and what they do there.\n\n**_A regular spell checker asks permission to “read and change all your data on all websites,” which could_**\n**_potentially pose a risk_**\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, extension developers are also able to push out updates without requiring any action by the end user, which\nmeans that even a legit extension could be later turned into malware or unwanted software. For instance, when an\n[account of the developer of a popular add-on was hijacked after a phishing attack, millions of users received adware on](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/after-phishing-attacks-chrome-extensions-push-adware-to-millions/)\ntheir devices without their knowledge. Sometimes developers sell a browser extension after it has gained a huge following.\nAfter fraudsters purchase the extension, they can update it with malicious or unwanted features, and that update will be\n[pushed to users. In that way, over 30,000 users got adware after an installed extension, dubbed Particle, was sold to new](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/-particle-chrome-extension-sold-to-new-dev-who-immediately-turns-it-into-adware/)\ndevelopers and later modified to inject ads into websites.\n\n## Methodology\n\nIn this research, we observed various types of threats that mimic useful web browser extensions, and the number of users\nattacked by them. For this purpose, we analyzed threat statistics from Kaspersky Security Network (KSN), a system for\nprocessing anonymized cyberthreat-related data shared voluntarily by Kaspersky users, for the period between January\n2020 and June 2022. Additionally, we prepared in-depth characteristics of four popular threats, hiding as browser add-ons,\nwith examples of which applications they can mimic and what danger they hold for users.\n\n## Key findings\n\nThroughout the first half of this year, 1,311,557 users tried to download malicious or unwanted extensions at least\nonce, which is more than 70 percent of the number of users affected by the same threat throughout the whole of last\nyear.\nFrom January 2020 to June 2022, more than 4.3 million unique users were attacked by adware hiding in browser\nextensions, which is approximately 70 percent of all users affected by malicious and unwanted add-ons.\nThe most common threat in the first half of 2022 was the WebSearch family of adware extensions, able to collect and\nanalyze search queries and redirect users to affiliate links.\n\n## Browser extensions threats: in figures\n\n[Since the beginning of 2020, Kaspersky products prevented 6,057,308 users from downloading malware,](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/malware/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation) [adware and](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/adware/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\n[riskware disguised as browser extensions. Our findings show that, during the analyzed period, the number of such users](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/riskware/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\npeaked in 2020 and reached 3,660,236. In 2021, the number of affected users halved, and we saw 1,823,263 unique\nusers attempting to download malicious or unwanted extensions. This year shows that in H1 1,311,557 users tried to\ndownload malicious and unwanted extensions at least once. This is more than 70 percent of the number of users affected\nthroughout the whole of last year, despite 2022 having six months left to run.\n\n_[Number of unique users affected by malicious or unwanted browser extensions (download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/08/16020759/01-en-ru-es-browser-extension.png)_\n\nOur telemetry shows that the most common threat spread under the guise of browser extensions is adware — unwanted\nsoftware designed to promote affiliates rather than improve user experience. Such ads are usually based on the browser\nhistory to tap users’ interests, redirect them to affiliate pages that the adware developers earn money from or embed\naffiliate banners and links in web pages. From January 2020 to June 2022, we observed more than 4.3 million unique\nusers attacked by adware hiding in browser extensions, which means approximately 70 percent of all affected users\nencountered this threat. Of these, more than 1 million users encountered adware in the first half of 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Affiliate ads even appear on the side of the search result page — all to draw the user’s attention to it_**\n\nThe second most widespread threat was malware (a type of computer program designed to infect a legitimate user’s\ncomputer and inflict harm on it in multiple ways). The aim of some malicious extensions is to steal login credentials and\nother sensitive information. In addition to stealing cookies and data copied to the clipboard, they can function as\nkeyloggers — monitoring software that is able to track and capture everything users type, making it a huge threat to\nvictims’ sensitive data, such as credentials and credit card details.\n\nFrom January 2020 to June 2022, we observed over 2.6 million unique users who were attacked by malware in the guise\nof a browser extension. This is 44 percent of all users who encountered malicious or unwanted extensions during this\nperiod.\n\n## The most common threat families in 2022 hiding as browser extensions\n\nTo provide a more detailed insight into how malicious and unwanted extensions operate, we also compiled an in-depth\nanalysis of four threat families. We analyzed if they are distributed in a legitimate web store or in a different way, what\nuseful extension functions they can use as a disguise, and how active they were in the first half of 2022.\n\n### WebSearch\n\nThe most common threat in the first half of 2022 was the WebSearch adware family, detected as not-avirus:HEUR:AdWare.Script.WebSearch.gen. In the first half of 2022, 876,924 unique users encountered WebSearch.\nTypically, this threat mimics tools for working with documents, such as DOC to PDF converters, document mergers, etc.\nFirst of all, WebSearch extensions change the browser’s start page so that, instead of the familiar Chrome page, the user\nsees a minimalistic site consisting of a search engine and several links to third-party resources, such as AliExpress or\nFarfetch. The transition to these resources is carried out through affiliate links — this is how attackers earn money from\ntheir extensions. The more often users follow these links, the more money the extension developers make.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The browser’s new-look home page after being hit by WebSearch_**\n\nAlso, the extension modifies the browser’s default search engine to search.myway[.]com, which can capture user queries,\ncollect and analyze them. Depending on what the user searched for, most relevant partner sites will be actively promoted\nin the search results.\n\n**_WebSearch extensions track everything the user searches for, then promote these products with affiliate ads on_**\n**_search engines_**\n\nOffice workers, who often have to use PDF viewers or converters at work, may be the most frequent victims of this threat,\nas WebSearch mostly hides behind this functionality. Usually, the extension performs its declared useful function so that\nthe user doesn’t uninstall it.\n\nExamples of this family are:\n\nkpocjpoifmommoiiiamepombpeoaehfh EasyPDFCombine\n\nmallpejgeafdahhflmliiahjdpgbegpk PDF Viewer & Converter by FromDocToPDF\n\nfncbkmmlcehhipmmofdhejcggdapcmon EasyPDFCombine\n\nceopoaldcnmhechacafgagdkklcogkgd OnlineMapFinder\n\nmabloidgodmbnmnhoenmhlcjkfelomgp EasyDocMerge\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrently this extension is no longer available in the Chrome Web Store, but can still be downloaded from third party file\nsharing resources and installed manually.\n\n### DealPly-related extensions\n\nDealPly-related extensions are adware, the first variations of which appeared back in late 2018, but remain popular with\ncybercriminals. These extensions are detected with the following verdicts:\n\nHEUR:AdWare.Script.Generic\nHEUR:AdWare.Script.Extension.gen.\n\nBetween January and June 2022, 97,515 unique Kaspersky users encountered DealPly-related add-ons.\n\nUnlike the WebSearch family, these extensions are not installed by the user, but by the adware executable DealPly, which\nKaspersky products detect as not-a-virus:AdWare.Win32.DealPly. Usually users get infected with DealPly when trying to\ndownload a loader of some hacked software from untrustworthy resources. Similar to the previous threat family, DealPlyrelated extensions also change the start page of the browser to place affiliate links on it.\n\n**_The new start page of the browser consists mainly of links to affiliate websites_**\n\nIn order to intercept user requests, the default search engine is changed. All queries that users make on this search\nengine are analyzed by the extension ⁠— based on the keywords entered in the queries, the user is redirected to a suitable\npartner site.\n\n**_The threat analyzes the keyword “iPhone” and, based on this, suggests a suitable offer on the partner website_**\n\nTo provide persistence for its extensions, DealPly creates the following branches in the Windows registry:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Google\\Chrome\\Extensions\\bifdhahddjbdbjmiekcnmeiffabcfjgh\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Google\\Chrome\\Extensions\\bifdhahddjbdbjmiekcnmeiffabcfjgh\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Google\\Chrome\\Extensions\\bifdhahddjbdbjmiekcnmeiffabcfjgh\n\n\nwith the value “update_url”=”hxxp[:]//juwakaha[.]com/update“. This value provides browsers with the path to extension\nupdates. Even if the user removes the add-on, each time the browser is launched it will download and reinstall it using this\npath. Note that the browser updates DealPly-related extensions, although they are installed from third-party servers, and\nnot from the official Chrome Web Store.\n\nWe assume that the most frequent victims of this threat are those who download hacked software from dubious resources;\ncommon examples of programs that DealPly mimics are KMS activators (programs that activate hacked Windows for free)\nor cheatengine, used to hack computer games. In addition, DealPly can also mimic installers of various software, including\nproprietary software.\n\nExamples of DealPly-related extensions are:\n\nbifdhahddjbdbjmiekcnmeiffabcfjgh Internal Chromium Extension\n\nncjbeingokdeimlmolagjaddccfdlkbd Internal Chromium Extension\n\nnahhmpbckpgdidfnmfkfgiflpjijilce Search Manager\n\npilplloabdedfmialnfchjomjmpjcoej Search Manager\n\n### AddScript\n\nAddScript is another threat family, hiding under the guise of browser extensions. The first samples of this family were seen\nin early 2019, and it remains active. In the first half of 2022, we observed 156,698 unique users that encountered\nAddScript.\n\nTypically, extensions of this family do have useful functions. For example, they can be tools for downloading music and\nvideos from social networks or proxy managers. However, in addition to the useful functionality, such extensions also carry\nout malicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_AddScript malicious code_**\n\nThe malicious code is obfuscated. When the extension is running, it contacts a hardcoded URL to get the C&C server\naddress. It then establishes a connection to the C&C server, receives malicious JavaScript from it, and runs it covertly. The\nonly way the user can notice the execution of third-party instructions is by the increased consumption of processor power.\n\nThe malicious script is updated from time to time and may perform various functions. For example, it can unobtrusively run\nvideos on the victim’s computer, so that its owners profit from the video being “viewed.” Another variant of malicious\nJavaScript performs cookie stuffing (also called “cookie dropping”). Traditionally, different brands promote affiliate products\non their sites. When a visitor clicks the affiliate link, an affiliate cookie is saved on their device. If the user then makes a\npurchase on the partner’s page, the owner of the site that saved the affiliate cookie gets a commission. AddScript drops\n\n\n-----\n\nmultiple affiliate cookies without the user clicking any links on any sites, in order to claim the commission for transactions\nthat happen in the browser. Put simply, the fraudsters trick websites into thinking they have sent them traffic without\nactually doing so.\n\nExamples of this family are:\n\nhdbipekpdpggjaipompnomhccfemaljm friGate3 proxy helper\n\nlfedlgnabjompjngkpddclhgcmeklana SaveFrom.net helper\n\naonedlchkbicmhepimiahfalheedjgbh Helper (an easy way to find the best prices)\n\noobppndjaabcidladjeehddkgkccfcpn Y2Mate – Video Downloader\n\nKaspersky products detect AddScript extensions with the verdict HEUR:Trojan.Script.Generic.\n\n### FB Stealer\n\nAnother malicious browser extension family is FB Stealer. It is one of the most dangerous families, because in addition to\nthe already traditional search engine substitution, FB Stealer is able to steal user credentials from Facebook. From\nJanuary to June 2022, Kaspersky security solutions detected 3,077 unique users who encountered FB Stealer.\n\nFB Stealer is installed by the malware rather than by the user. Once added to the browser, it mimics the harmless and\nstandard-looking Chrome extension Google Translate.\n\ncolgdlijdieibnaccfdcdbpdffofkfeb Google Translate\n\nfdempkefdmgfcogieifmnadjhohaljcb Google Translate\n\n**_Malicious FB Stealer extension added from third-party resources. Browser warns that it has no information about_**\n**_this extension_**\n\nThe Trojan delivering FB Stealer is called NullMixer. It masquerades as a cracked software installer, and thus reaches\nusers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_NullMixer spreads through hacked software installers, for example, SolarWinds Broadband Engineers Edition_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Downloading a password-protected archive with NullMixer inside_**\n\nThe extension files are stored in the resources section of the NullMixer executable and, during installation, are copied to\nthe %AppData%\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions folder. The installer also modifies the Secure\nPreferences file, which contains Chrome settings, including information about extensions. As soon as this is done, the\nextension becomes active.\n\nSimilar to previous families, the extension changes the default search engine. In this case, it sets it to\nhxxps[:]//www.ctcodeinfo[.]com. In addition, the attackers extract Facebook session cookies — secrets stored in the\nbrowser that hold identification data allowing users to stay logged in — and send them to their own servers. Using these\ncookies, they are able to quickly log in to the victim’s Facebook account and hijack it by changing the login details. Once\ninside the account, the attackers can ask the victim’s friends for money, trying to get as much as possible before the user\nregains access to the account.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attackers use script obfuscation techniques to hide malicious code**\n\n## Conclusion and recommendations\n\nBrowser extensions remain one of the most common ways for cybercriminals to get money, whether by redirecting users to\naffiliate pages, cookie stuffing or even stealing the victim’s credentials. Hence, numerous users might wonder: is it worth\ndownloading browser extensions at all if they carry so many threats? We believe that extensions only improve the user\nonline experience, and some add-ons can even make devices a lot safer. That said, it’s important to keep an eye on how\nreputable and trustworthy the developer is, and what permissions the extension asks for. If you follow the\nrecommendations for safe use of browser extensions, the risk of encountering the threats described above will be minimal.\n\nTo stay safe while using browser add-ons:\n\nOnly use trusted sources to download software. Malware and unwanted applications are often distributed through\nthird-party resources, where no one checks their security like official web stores do. These applications may install\nmalicious or unwanted browser extensions without the user knowing about it, and perform other malicious or\nunwanted activity.\nSince extensions add extra functionality to browsers, they require access to various resources and permissions —\nyou should carefully examine add-on requests before agreeing to them.\nLimit the number of extensions used at any one time and periodically review your installed extensions. Uninstall\nextensions that you no longer use or that you do not recognize.\n[Use a robust security solution. Private Browsing in Kaspersky Internet Security, for example, prevents online](https://www.kaspersky.com/internet-security)\nmonitoring and protects you from web threats.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**WebSearch extension MD5**\n\n[dd7bd821cd4a88e2540a01a9f4b5e209](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/dd7bd821cd4a88e2540a01a9f4b5e209/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**WebSearch extension ID**\n\nkpocjpoifmommoiiiamepombpeoaehfh\n\nfncbkmmlcehhipmmofdhejcggdapcmon\n\nmallpejgeafdahhflmliiahjdpgbegpk\n\nceopoaldcnmhechacafgagdkklcogkgd\n\nmabloidgodmbnmnhoenmhlcjkfelomgp\n\n**DealPly installer MD5**\n\n[E91538ECBED3228FF5B28EFE070CE587](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/E91538ECBED3228FF5B28EFE070CE587/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**DealPly-related extension MD5**\n\n[38a7b26c02de9b35561806ee57d61438](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/38a7b26c02de9b35561806ee57d61438/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n\n-----\n\n**DealPly related extension ID**\nbifdhahddjbdbjmiekcnmeiffabcfjgh\n\nncjbeingokdeimlmolagjaddccfdlkbd\n\nnahhmpbckpgdidfnmfkfgiflpjijilce\n\npilplloabdedfmialnfchjomjmpjcoej\n\n**AddScript extension MD5**\n\n[28a18438e85aacad71423b044d0f9e3c](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/28a18438e85aacad71423b044d0f9e3c/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**AddScript extension ID**\n\nhdbipekpdpggjaipompnomhccfemaljm\n\nlfedlgnabjompjngkpddclhgcmeklana\n\naonedlchkbicmhepimiahfalheedjgbh\n\noobppndjaabcidladjeehddkgkccfcpn\n\n**NullMixer MD5**\n\n[F94BF1734F34665A65A835CC04A4AD95](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/F94BF1734F34665A65A835CC04A4AD95/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**FBStealer extension installer MD5**\n\n[5010c3b42d269cb06e5598a5b1b143a5](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/5010c3b42d269cb06e5598a5b1b143a5/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n**FBStealer extension ID**\n\ncolgdlijdieibnaccfdcdbpdffofkfeb\n\nfdempkefdmgfcogieifmnadjhohaljcb\n\n[Adware](https://securelist.com/tag/adware/)\n[Browser](https://securelist.com/tag/browser/)\n[Browser Plugins](https://securelist.com/tag/browser-plugins/)\n[Data theft](https://securelist.com/tag/data-theft/)\n[Firefox](https://securelist.com/tag/firefox/)\n[Google Chrome](https://securelist.com/tag/google-chrome/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Statistics](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-statistics/)\n[Safari](https://securelist.com/tag/safari/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n\nAuthors\n\nKaspersky\n\nThreat in your browser: what dangers innocent-looking extensions hold for users\n\nYour email address will not be published.
