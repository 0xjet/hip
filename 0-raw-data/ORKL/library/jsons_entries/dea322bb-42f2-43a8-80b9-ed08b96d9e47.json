This isn’t new. This same thing has been going on, week in and week out,\nfor years, with very little changing.\n\nUnfortunately, ransomware is here to stay. Ransomware infections continue to cause\nsignificant impact to organizations, including—but not limited to—disruptions to operations,\ntheft of confidential information, monetary loss due to ransom payout, and more. It’s why we\nfeel it's imperative that we increase our efforts to raise awareness about existing and\nemerging ransomware variants.\n\nThis new Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the\nevolving ransomware landscape, along with the Fortinet solutions that protect against these\nvariants.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the LockBit, BlueSky, Deno,\nRedAlert, Dark Web Hacker, Hive, and Again ransomware.\n\n## LockBit Ransomware\n\n[LockBit is a ransomware strain that targets both Windows and Linux. It has been in the wild](https://www.fortiguard.com/threat-signal-report/4055/lockbit-2-0-ransomware-as-a-service-raas-incorporates-enhanced-delivery-mechanism-via-group-policy)\nsince December 2019. This ransomware employs a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\nmodel. Ransomware operators develop LockBit ransomware and all the necessary tools and\ninfrastructure to support it, such as leak sites and ransom payment portals. They offer these\nsolutions, along with user support, to their affiliates (criminals who pay a fee to use their\ntechnology). Support is provided via TOX (a RaaS framework). They also offer additional\nservices, such as ransom negotiation, for affiliates.\n\nLockBit affiliates carry out the actual attacks that infect and deploy ransomware to targets\nand, in return, receive 20% of the ransom paid by victims. While rules prohibit affiliates from\nencrypting files in critical infrastructure environments, such as nuclear power plants or gas\nand oil industries, affiliates are allowed to steal data without encrypting critical files and or the\ninfrastructure of these organizations. In addition, former Soviet countries (Armenia, Belarus,\nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan,\nTurkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Estonia) are off-limits from attack.\n\nFigure 1. Affiliate rules for LockBit 3.0 on its Tor site\n\nPrior to file encryption, data on victim machines is exfiltrated using “StealBit,” an information\nstealer tool developed by the LockBit gang. Files encrypted by the ransomware typically\nhave a “.lockbit” file extension. The ransomware also leaves a ransom note in Restore-MyFiles.txt.\n\nSome variants of LockBit also replace desktop wallpaper with a message to let victims know\nthat they are a victim of the ransomware, asking them to check the ransom note for how to\nreach out to the LockBit threat actor. LockBit employs a double-extortion tactic that demands\nvictims pay their ransom in Bitcoin to recover affected files and not have stolen information\nleaked to the public.\n\nLockBit 3.0 debuted in March 2022 as a successor to LockBit 2.0. The ransomware made\nthe news again at the end of June because the ransomware gang introduced a “bug bounty”\nprogram with rewards of between $1000 and $1,000,000 (USD) for detecting flaws and\nweaknesses in its portfolio.\n\nFigure 2. Bug bounty program advertised on LockBit Tor site\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\n\n-----\n\nFortinet customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected by the following\nsignature(s):\n\nW32/Filecoder.LOCKBIT!tr\n\nW32/Filecoder_Lockbit.A!tr\n\nW64/Lockbit.A!tr\n\nW64/Lockbit.A!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Lockbit.B!t\n\nW64/Lockbit.B!tr\n\nW32/Lockbit.D!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Lockbit.E!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Lockbit.D!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Lockbit.E!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Filecoder_Lockbit.E!tr\n\nW32/Filecoder_Lockbit.E!tr.ransom\n\nW32/LockBit.2513!tr.ransom\n\nW32/LockBit.29EA!tr.ransom\n\nW32/LockBit.29FC!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Lockbit.2D74!tr.ransom\n\nW32/LockBit.921B!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Lockbit.A467!tr\n\nW32/Lockbit.BF6C!tr\n\nW32/Lockbit.C2F8!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Lockbit.FSWW!tr\n\nW32/Lockbit.GCZ!tr\n\nW32/Lockbit.NVBZVOW!tr\n\n\n-----\n\nW32/Lockbit.VHO!tr\n\nW32/Lockbit.VHO!tr.ransom\n\nW32/Ransom_Win32_LOCKBIT.ENC\n\nHTML/Lockbit.FCBE!tr.ransom\n\n## BlueSky Ransomware\n\nBlueSky is a recently discovered ransomware variant, with some BlueSky ransomware\nsamples distributed online as “MarketShere.exe” and “SecurityUpdate.exe.” BlueSky\nencrypts files on a compromised machine and then adds a “.bluesky” file extension. It then\ndrops a ransom note in “# DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.txt“and “# DECRYPT FILES\nBLUESKY #.html,” in which victims are asked to visit a BlueSky TOR site and follow provided\ninstructions.\n\nFigure 1.

It then drops a ransom note in “readme.txt” which\nprovides two ProtonMail email addresses for victims to contact the attacker to recover\naffected files. Interestingly enough, there is no information on how much this will cost and if\npayment is what the threat actor is ultimately after.\n\nFigure 3. Readme.TXT for DENO ransomware\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected by the following\nsignature(s):\n\nW32/Filecoder.OLQ!tr\n\n\n-----\n\nMSIL/Agent.MDO!tr.ransom\n\nMalicious_Behavior.SB\n\nW32/PossibleThreat\n\n## RedAlert\n\nRedAlert, also known as N13V, is a new ransomware discovered in early July. It affects\nWindows and Linux VMWare (ESXi) servers. It encrypts files on the compromised machine\nand steals data from it. One reported file extension that this ransomware variant adds to\naffected files is “.crypt658”, but this may change depending on the victim.\n\nThis ransomware uses a double-extortion tactic, which demands a ransom payment to\nrecover affected files and prevents the release of stolen data to its data leak site for anyone\nto download. To pressure victims into paying a ransom, the authors also ask the victim to\ncontact the attacker within 72 hours, or else the threat actor will publish part of the stolen\ndata to their leak site. Additional threats include launching Distributed Denial of Service\n(DDoS) attacks against the victim and making phone calls to the victim’s employees as a\nshame tactic.\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected by the following\nsignature(s):\n\nELF/RedAlert.A!tr.ransom\n\n## Dark Web Hacker\n\nDark Web Hacker is another recently discovered ransomware. It encrypts files on a\ncompromised machine and appends \".[4 random characters}” to target files and the end of\nthe file name. It also leaves a ransom note in “read_it.txt” containing an attacker’s contact\nemail address and Bitcoin address. Ransom demand is $3,000 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFigure 4. Ransom note\n\nThe ransomware also replaces any desktop wallpaper with its own wallpaper that includes a\nBitcoin QR code to “help” victims to pay a ransom.\n\nThe ransomware also deletes shadow copies, which makes file recovery difficult.\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\n\n-----\n\nFortinet Customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected by the following\nsignature:\n\nMSIL/Filecoder.AGP!tr\n\n## Hive\n\nHive ransomware is another Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) that attempts to encrypt files\non victims’ machines, steal data, and demand a payment to recover affected files and\nprevent stolen data from being published to their data leak site, called “HiveLeaks,\" on the\nDarkWeb. This ransomware notoriously affected Costa Rica's public health system, which\nwas reportedly disrupted by the ransomware.\n\nThe latest iterations are written in the Rust programing language. Older variants are written\nin Go.\n\n_Decryptor Tool Now Available_\n\nOn July 13, security researcherth [@reecDeep released a v5 keystream decryptor tool for](https://twitter.com/reecdeep/status/1546766063223857152)\nHive ransomware. The tool can be found on @reecDeep’s Github [page.](https://github.com/reecdeep/HiveV5_keystream_decryptor)\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortiGuard Labs previously released a Threat Signal for Hive ransomware report. For\n[additional information on Hive ransomware, please visit this link.](https://fortiguard.fortinet.com/threat-signal-report/4610)\n\nFortinet Customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected by the following\nsignature:\n\nW64/Filecoder_Hive.A!tr.ransom\n\nW64/Filecoder_Hive.A!tr\n\n## What is ‘Again’ ransomware?\n\nThe Again ransomware is another new ransomware variant that seems to have its origins in\nBabuk. It appears to share the same source code as Babuk (which had its entire source\ncode leaked in 2021) and can safely be considered a fork of that variant. The Again\nransomware seeks out files to encrypt and appends “.again” to the filename, rendering them\ninoperable.\n\nVictims are presented with a text file entitled “How To Restore Your Files.txt.\" It contains\ninformation on contacting the bad actor(s) behind the ransomware using a predefined TOR\nwebsite. On this site, the page has a submit message page to the ransom actor, who will\nlikely seek something in return from the victim in exchange for their files.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet Customers running the latest (AV) definitions are protected by the following\nsignature:\n\nW64/Filecoder_Rook.B!tr.ransom\n\n## Best practices include not paying a ransom\n\nVictims of ransomware are cautioned against paying ransom by organizations such as CISA,\nNCSC, the [FBI, and HHS, partly because payment does not guarantee files will be](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware)\nrecovered. Ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional\norganizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit\nactivities that could potentially be illegal, according to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office\n[of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory. The FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page,](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Ransomware)\nwhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via the Internet Crimes Complaint\nCenter (IC3).\n\n_Learn more about Fortinet’s_ _[FortiGuard Labs threat research and intelligence organization](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguard-labs)_\n_[and the FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?tab=security-bundles&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=security-bundles)_\n\n\n-----",
