This malware has been on sale by\nan actor under the username Yattaze, starting in late April. The actor offers the sale of the malware as a standalone build with charges for\neach additional rebuild, or the ability to set up a botshop in which case any customer can establish their own operation and further sell access\nto a new customer base.\n\nMalware authors and distributors leverage downloader malware and botshops to build malware distribution networks. Malware distribution\nnetworks are commonly used by cyber criminals to create botnets to distribute additional payloads such as credential theft\nmalware, ransomware, banking Trojans, and others. These distribution networks are often run by third party operators and offered as a\nservice in underground markets.\n\n**NOTE: ASERT actively collects indicators associated with this malware family to provide protection for our Netscout Arbor**\n**customers.**\n\n## History\n\nOn April 21, 2018 actor Yattaze began advertising the open public beta of a downloader named Kardon Loader for $50. The description of the\nmalware family suggests this malware was a rebrand of the ZeroCool botnet which was under development previously by the same\nactor. The actor has had an account on the forum since April 2017 and received multiple vouches for this product. The advertisement for the\nloader is professional looking with its own logo (Figure 1 & Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nKardon Loader Advertisement\n\n\nFigure 1: The advertisement for the loader is professional looking with its own logo.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Kardon Loader\n\nPricing[/caption] The actor provides a disclaimer stating this software should not be used for malicious purposes (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3:\n\nKardon Loader Disclaimer[/caption] Additionally, the actor uploaded a YouTube video showing the panel functionality from an admin\nstandpoint (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Kardon Loader YouTube Walkthrough\n\n## Distribution\n\nInsights gained from the forum thread suggest the actor initially conducted tests by leveraging a well-known botshop named “Pink Panther’s\nautomated loads shop (Pink)”. Commentary from the actor reveals this bot is not widely distributed at this time. Only 124 infections are shown\nin a screenshot of the loader’s test network posted by the actor (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5:\n\nKardon Loader Administrator Panel Showing Infections[/caption]\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe actor alleges the following functionality is available or forthcoming to Kardon Loader:\n\nBot Functionality\nDownload and Execute Task\nUpdate Task\nUninstall Task\nUsermode Rootkit\nRC4 Encryption (Not Yet Implemented)\nDebug and Analysis Protection\nTOR Support\nDomain Generation Algorithm (DGA)\n\n\n-----\n\nASERT found many of these features absent in the samples reviewed. All samples analyzed used hard coded command and\ncontrol (C2) URLs instead of DGA. There was also no evidence of TOR or user mode rootkit functionality in the binaries.\n\n## Anti-Analysis Techniques\n\nKardon Loader uses a few anti-analysis techniques, such as attempting to get the module handle for the following DLLs:\n\navghookx.dll\navghooka.dll\nsnxhk.dll\nsbiedll.dll\ndbghelp.dll\napi_log.dll\ndir_watch.dll\npstorec.dll\nvmcheck.dll\nwpespy.dll\n\nIf any of the above DLL handles are returned it will exit the process. These DLLs are associated with antivirus, analysis tools, and\nvirtualization. Kardon Loader will also enumerate the CPUID Vendor ID value and compare it against the following strings:\n\nKVMKVMKVM\nMicrosoft Hv\nVMwareVMware\nXenVMMXenVMM\nprl hyperv\nVBoxVBoxVBox\n\nThese are known CPUID Vendor ID values associated with virtualized machines. If one of these values are detected the malware will also\nexit.\n\n## Command and Control\n\nKardon Loader uses HTTP based C2 infrastructure with URL parameters that are base64 encoded. Upon execution Kardon Loader will\nsend HTTP POSTs to the C2 with the following fields:\n\n**ID = Identification Number**\n**OS = Operating System**\n**PV = User Privilege**\n**IP = Initial Payload (Full Path)**\n**CN = Computer Name**\n**UN = User Name**\n**CA = Processor Architecture**\n\nAn example of the POST payload sent from Kardon Loader sample upon execution can be seen in (Figure 6): [caption id=\"attachment_9578\"\nalign=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"]\n\nFigure 6:\n\nKardon Loader POST Request[/caption] Once the request is made, the C2 server will provide varying feedback which will result\nin either downloading and executing additional payloads, visiting a website, upgrading current payloads, or uninstalling itself. The C2 server\nresponse format for a wait command is:\n\n**notask**\n\nWhile other commands including the download and execution functionality use the following format:\n\n**newtask`##`# <url>**\n\nHashmarks represent the two-character task id and one-character task value\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the infected host will send a confirmation message back to the C2 in the same format as the initial post payload with the\nfollowing additional fields:\n\n**TD = Task Identifier (Provided by command and control)**\n**OP = Task Output (1 if successful, 2 if not successful)**\n\nAnalysis of various samples reveal another parameter used for uninstalling of the loader directed by the C2:\n\n**UN = Uninstalled**\n\nPosts from the actor on their advertisement thread suggests that C2 communication for this family will be changed to RC4 encryption in the\nfuture. Also, if the actor truly implements DGA, it may use it as a fallback mechanism for C2.\n\n## Administration Panel\n\nThe panel\n\nfor Kardon Loader incorporates a simple design with a dashboard of the bot distribution and install statistics. A notable feature of this panel is\nthe bot store functionality allowing the bot admin to generate access keys to customers that would give them the ability to execute tasks\nbased on the predefined parameters (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8:\n\nKardon Loader Store[/caption] Users can specify a URL then provide the task type and number of executions in order to distribute commands\nto bots on the network. This is shown in the actors instructional YouTube video (Figure 4).\n\n## Conclusion and Recommendations\n\n\n-----\n\nThis article is an overview of the downloader malware known as Kardon Loader. Kardon Loader is a fully featured downloader, enabling the\ndownload and installation of other malware, eg. banking trojans/credential theft etc. Downloaders are a critical part of the malware\necosystem, often developed by specialists and sold independently of the trojan that is the objective of the campaign. Although only in public\nbeta stage this malware features bot store functionality allowing purchasers to open up their own botshop with this platform. The actor started\nadvertising this loader in late April and has communicated further development will do done on this loader in the future, including encrypted\nC2 communications.\n\nAt a minimum organizations should leverage the indicators contained within this report to block malicious activity associated\nwith Kardon Loader. Researchers may also leverage the Yara rule below to look for additional copies of Kardon Loader to extract other IOCs\nfor blocking malicious activity.\n\n### Yara Rule\n\n[https://gist.github.com/arbor-asert/2ad9c7d715f41efc9d59ed8c425d10d3](https://gist.github.com/arbor-asert/2ad9c7d715f41efc9d59ed8c425d10d3)\n\n### Hashes\n\nfd0dfb173aff74429c6fed55608ee99a24e28f64ae600945e15bf5fce6406aee\nb1a1deaacec7c8ac43b3dad8888640ed77b2a4d44f661a9e52d557e7833c7a21\n3c64d7dbef4b7e0dd81a5076172451334fe9669800c40c895567226f7cb7cdc7\n\n### Command and Control URLs\n\nKardon[.]ddns[.]net\nJhuynfrkijucdxiu[.]club\nKreuzberg[.]ru\nCryptdrop[.]xyz\n\nPosted In\n\nBotnets\nMalware\nUncategorized\n\n## Subscribe\n\n_Sign up now to receive the latest notifications and updates from NETSCOUT's ASERT._\n\n\n-----",
