Version 2.17.0 of the software was released on December 17_\n_after issues were discovered with the previous release (2.16). Apache said that 2.16 does_\n_not always protect from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation and is vulnerable to CVE-_\n_2021-45105, a denial of service vulnerability._\n\n**UPDATE December 15, 2021: Apache has patched a second vulnerability in Log4j. The**\n_[vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) arises from the fact that the fix for the previous vulnerability](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)_\n_(CVE-2021-44228) did not completely prevent exploits in all circumstances._\n\n_According to Apache, the vulnerability occurs in certain non-default configurations. It could_\n_permit attackers to “craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a_\n_denial of service (DOS) attack”._\n\nA zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been discovered in Apache Log4j which, if\nexploited, could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.\nExploit code for this vulnerability, dubbed Log4Shell, has been shared publicly and multiple\nattackers are already attempting to exploit it.\n\n**Q: Will Symantec protect against exploit attempts?**\n\n**A: Yes, Symantec products will guard against exploit attempts and payloads with the**\nfollowing detections:\n\n**File-based**\n\nTrojan.Maljava\nCL.Suspexec!gen106\nCL.Suspexec!gen107\nCL.Suspexec!gen108\nMiner.XMRig!gen2\nRansom.Khonsari\nRansom.Tellyouthepass\nRansom.Tellyouthepa!g1\nRansom.Tellyouthepa!g2\nLinux.Kaiten\nTrojan Horse\n\n**Machine learning-based**\n\n\n-----\n\nHeur.AdvML.C\n\n**Network-based**\n\nAttack: Log4j2 RCE CVE-2021-44228\nAttack: Log4j2 RCE CVE-2021-44228 2\nAttack: Log4j CVE-2021-45046\nAttack: Malicious LDAP Response\nAudit: Log4j2 RCE CVE-2021-44228\nAudit: Malicious LDAP Response\nAudit: Suspicious Java Class File Executing Arbitrary Commands\n\n**Email-based**\n\nCoverage is in place for Symantec's email security products\n\n**Symantec Data Center Security provides a range of protection for server workloads against**\nthis vulnerability:\n\nPrevention policies prevent malware from being dropped or executed on the system\nAbility to block or limit LDAP, http, and other traffic from server workloads and\ncontainerized applications using Log4j to internal trusted servers\nPrevention policies sandboxing provides protection from remote code execution by\npreventing execution of dual use tools, credential theft, and protecting critical system\nfiles and resources\n\n**Web-based**\n\nWebPulse observed traffic is currently protected for the Log4jShell vulnerability through\nnormal processes\n\n**Q: What is the significance of this vulnerability?**\n\n**A: Apache Log4j is a java-based logging utility. It is widely used in cloud and enterprise**\nsoftware services. The fact that an exploit was discovered prior to the creation of a patch\nonly heightens the severity of the threat.\n\n**Q: Has the vulnerability been patched?**\n\n**[A: Yes, users are advised to update to version 2.15.0 immediately. Apache has also](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)**\nprovided mitigation advice for users of earlier versions.\n\n**Q: Is this vulnerability being exploited in the wild?**\n\n\n-----\n\n**A: Yes. Exploit code is publicly available and there are multiple reports of exploit attempts. To**\ndate, activity appears to be mainly centered on coin mining botnets but it is only a matter of\ntime before attackers of all types attempt to leverage this exploit.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Learn More Now\n\n1.
