Russia-aligned\n\n Sednit and Sandworm, North Korea-aligned Konni, and geographically\n\n unattributed Winter Vivern and Sturgeon Phisher seized the opportunity\n\n to exploit vulnerabilities in WinRAR (Sednit, SturgeonPhisher, and\n\n Konni), Roundcube (Sednit and Winter Vivern), Zimbra (Winter Vivern),\n\n and Outlook for Windows (Sednit) to target various governmental\n\n organizations in Ukraine, Europe, and Central Asia. Regarding China\n aligned threat actors, GALLIUM probably exploited weaknesses in\n\n Microsoft Exchange servers or IIS servers, extending its targeting from\n\n telecommunications operators to government organizations around\n\n the world; MirrorFace probably exploited vulnerabilities in the Proself\n\n online storage service; and TA410 probably exploited flaws in the Adobe\n\n ColdFusion application server.\n\n Iran- and Middle East-aligned groups continued to operate at\n\n high volume, primarily focusing on espionage and data theft from\n\n organizations in Israel. Notably, Iran-aligned MuddyWater also targeted\n\n\n###### an unidentified entity in Saudi Arabia, deploying a payload that suggests\n\n the possibility of this threat actor serving as an access development\n\n team for a more advanced group.\n\n The prime target of Russia-aligned groups remained Ukraine, where\n\n we discovered new versions of the known wipers RoarBat and\n\n NikoWiper, and a new wiper we named SharpNikoWiper, all deployed\n\n by Sandworm. Interestingly, while other groups – such as Gamaredon,\n\n GREF, and SturgeonPhisher – target Telegram users to try to exfiltrate\n\n information or at least some Telegram-related metadata, Sandworm\n\n uses this service for active measure purposes, advertising its cyber\n sabotage operations. However, Gamaredon remained the most active\n\n group in Ukraine, significantly enhancing its data-collecting capabilities\n\n by redeveloping existing tools and deploying new ones.\n\n North Korea-aligned groups continued to focus on Japan, South\n\n Korea, and South Korea-focused entities, employing carefully crafted\n\n spearphishing emails. The most active Lazarus scheme observed was\n\n Operation DreamJob, luring targets with fake job offers for lucrative\n\n positions. This group consistently demonstrated its capability to create\n\n malware for all major desktop platforms. Finally, our researchers\n\n uncovered the operations of three previously unidentified China-aligned\n\n\n###### groups: DigitalRecyclers, repeatedly compromising a governmental\n\n organization in the EU; TheWizards, conducting adversary-in-the\n middle attacks; and PerplexedGoblin, targeting another government\n\n organization in the EU.\n\n ESET APT Activity Reports contain only a fraction of the cybersecurity\n\n intelligence data provided to customers of ESET’s private APT reports.\n\n ESET researchers prepare in-depth technical reports and frequent\n\n activity summaries detailing activities of specific APT groups, in the\n\n form of ESET APT Reports PREMIUM, to help organizations tasked with\n\n protecting citizens, critical national infrastructure, and high-value assets\n\n from criminal and nation-state-directed cyberattacks.

We also\n\n observed a governmental entity in Guyana being targeted by a cluster of\n\n activity we named Operation Jacana, a governmental entity in Kuwait and\n\n a hosting provider targeted by TA410 and, finally, a watering hole attack by\n\n FishMonger against a Pakistani government website. In the same period,\n\n MirrorFace continued to heavily target Japanese organizations. We also\n\n uncovered a China-aligned APT group, which we named TheWizards, spying\n\n on Chinese speakers in mainland China and abroad using adversary-in-the\n middle (AitM) attacks. We also discovered that the Worok APT group has\n\n developed a new Go backdoor that we have named GoFighting.\n\n Mustang Panda\n\n In August, ESET researchers identified a campaign by Mustang Panda\n\n targeting a governmental organization in Slovakia. There is no indication\n\n leading us to think that this organization was successfully compromised. It\n\n is worth noting that this Mustang Panda spearphishing operation happened\n\n amidst the political campaigns for the Slovak parliamentary elections.\n\n\n###### Targets first received a spearphishing email with a tracking pixel, enabling\n\n the attacker to know when the target opens the email. A malicious link is\n\n then sent in a second email. We believe the goal is to identify users who are\n\n more likely to open phishing emails and target them specifically in order to\n\n reduce the risk of the payload being reported to IT or security services.\n\n That malicious link leads to a ZIP archive containing a LNK file that\n\n downloads and executes an HTA script, which then deploys the group’s\n\n classic trident Korplug loader. The only significant difference here being\n\n that the malicious DLL is written in Nim. While this is the first instance we\n\n could find of Mustang Panda using Nim, it is consistent with the group’s\n\n recent exploration of new programming languages and technology.\n\n Over the last months, we also observed Mustang Panda increasingly relying\n\n on Cloudflare to hide its actual C&C and distribution servers.\n\n FishMonger\n\n In July, ESET researchers detected a watering-hole attack on a legitimate,\n\n but presumably compromised, Pakistani government website. If the\n\n visitor is using a computer, not a smartphone, the script displays an alert\n\n\n###### box (see Figure 1) and if the visitor clicks on OK, a Windows executable is\n\n downloaded onto the device.\n\n Figure 1. Malicious alert box\n\n The downloaded executable is a backdoor named Trochilus, which is\n\n commonly used by other China-aligned APT groups such as Webworm.\n\n However, the C&C server had typical characteristics of the ShadowPad\n\n servers deployed by FishMonger. Therefore, we believe with medium\n\n confidence that FishMonger is behind this watering-hole attack and is a\n\n Trochilus backdoor user.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 7 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### TA410\n\n The various TA410 subgroups were defined in a\n\n WeLiveSecurity blogpost.\n\n FlowingFrog\n\n In mid 2023, we observed activity by the FlowingFrog\n\n TA410 subgroup on the server of a US hosting provider.\n\n We detected samples of the Tendyron backdoor\n\n that were deployed after the attacker unsuccessfully\n\n tried to deploy multiple Jakarta Server Pages (JSP)\n\n web backdoors. The Tendyron backdoor and multiple\n\n variations of the JSP web backdoor were transferred to\n\n the server in quick succession.\n\n We believe initial access was achieved by exploiting\n\n a known vulnerability, since the affected server\n\n was running an out-of-date version of the Adobe\n\n ColdFusion application server.\n\n LookingFrog\n\n ESET researchers observed activity in our telemetry\n\n by the LookingFrog TA410 subgroup on a computer\n\n belonging to a governmental entity in Kuwait. We\n\n detected a sample of the group’s custom LookBack\n\n implant, along with the Stegmap backdoor and a\n\n persistence tool; both of the latter two were previously\n\n attributed to Looking Frog in a blogpost by Symantec.\n\n\n###### The campaigns have distributed the Android\n\n BadBazaar espionage code through the Google Play\n\n store, Samsung Galaxy Store, and dedicated websites\n\n representing the malicious apps Signal Plus Messenger\n\n and FlyGram. The threat actors patched the open\n source Signal and Telegram apps for Android with\n\n malicious code that we have identified as BadBazaar,\n\n which has previously been used to target Uyghurs and\n\n other Turkic ethnic minorities. Based on our research,\n\n potential victims were also lured to install the malicious\n\n FlyGram app from a Uyghur Telegram group focused\n\n on Android app sharing; see Figure 2.\n\n The purpose of these trojanized apps is to exfiltrate\n\n user data and, specifically in Signal Plus Messenger, to\n\n spy on victims’ Signal communication. After publishing\n\n our blogpost, Volexity published a report on three\n\n Android malware families – BadBazaar, BadSignal, and\n\n BadSolar – and attributed them to a group they call\n\n EvilBamboo. More specifically, the BadSignal malware\n\n family analyzed by Volexity is what ESET has described\n\n as trojanized Signal and Telegram applications, with the\n\n added malicious code that has the same functionality\n\n as earlier BadBazaar variants reported by Lookout.\n\n In order to avoid confusion: moving forward, we will\n\n adopt this naming convention to distinguish between\n\n the original BadBazaar, and its BadSignal variant, which\n\n is delivered via trojanized applications.\n\n\n###### This version of LookBack is almost identical to those\n\n we described in our WeLiveSecurity blogpost, while\n\n the Stegmap sample downloads a image containing\n\n the encrypted next stage encoded in the image.\n\n\n###### GREF\n\n We recently published a WeLiveSecurity blogpost\n\n documenting two active campaigns targeting Android\n\n users, that we attribute to the GREF group.\n\n\n###### Figure 2. Signal Plus Messenger apps on Google Play (left; no longer available), Samsung Galaxy Store (center), and the FlyGram app on Galaxy Store (right)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 8 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### MirrorFace\n\n MirrorFace continued with its campaigns targeting Japanese entities\n\n exclusively. In August 2023, we observed an interesting change in the\n\n attack vector: instead of compromising an entity via the victim opening a\n\n malicious attachment to a spearphishing email, MirrorFace compromised\n\n an IT company through a vulnerable server. Our analysis of the incident\n\n indicates that the server was most likely compromised through a vulnerable\n\n instance of Proself, an online storage service. Proself released an advisory in\n\n July 2023 stating that its products contained an authentication bypass and\n\n zero-day remote code execution vulnerability that had been confirmed to\n\n be already exploited.\n\n A few days after the aforementioned incident, MirrorFace continued on\n\n the same trend and once again compromised a vulnerable server, but this\n\n time of a research institute. MirrorFace delivered its flagship backdoor\n\n LODEINFO alongside various publicly available exploitation tools such as\n\n EfsPotato, DCOMPotato, FullPowers, Yasso, the customized reverse proxy\n\n frp, and a previously undescribed backdoor. This shows that MirrorFace has\n\n enriched its toolset repertoire and, besides its in-house developed malware,\n\n MirrorFace has started using publicly available exploitation tools as well.\n\n GALLIUM\n\n During the last six months, ESET researchers have observed GALLIUM\n\n compromising telecommunications operators in Mali, Türkiye, and French\n\n Polynesia, and a government organization in Guatemala. We discovered\n\n these campaigns while monitoring implants known to have been used\n\n by GALLIUM in the past, including the recently documented toolset used\n\n during Operation Tainted Love.\n\n\n###### Most of the compromised systems are Microsoft Exchange servers or\n\n Microsoft IIS servers, all with numerous webshells detected; it’s likely that\n\n the attackers exploited one or more of the various remote code execution\n\n vulnerabilities discovered in the past few years on these platforms, or\n\n reused already deployed webshells in order to deploy their own implants.\n\n On the compromised systems, GALLIUM deployed mim221, a custom\n\n credential theft implant based on Mimikatz.\n\n DigitalRecyclers\n\n ESET researchers uncovered the activity of a newly identified\n\n cyberespionage group, which we have named DigitalRecyclers, that\n\n repeatedly compromised a governmental organization in the European\n\n Union since 2018, using a toolset originally developed by threat actors from\n\n Pakistan in the 2010s.\n\n In a recent incident, we were able to determine that the attackers\n\n dropped a first-stage downloader through a Microsoft Exchange web\n\n server accessible from the internet. Interestingly, attackers accessed\n\n the victim’s server using a custom VPN service that is also used by\n\n BackdoorDiplomacy. The use of such custom anonymization networks is\n\n an ongoing trend among China-aligned threat actors.\n\n We believe that DigitalRecyclers is loosely linked to BackdoorDiplomacy and\n\n the wider APT15 family.\n\n TheWizards\n\n TheWizards is a China-aligned APT group active since at least 2021,\n\n engaging in cyberespionage operations against Chinese-speaking\n\n\n###### individuals based in mainland China and abroad (e.g., the Philippines, the\n\n United Arab Emirates, and Hong Kong), and against gambling companies\n\n based outside mainland China. ESET researchers discovered this threat\n\n actor when a malicious update was downloaded by a popular, legitimate\n\n Chinese application.\n\n TheWizards group has capabilities to conduct adversary-in-the-middle\n\n (AitM) attacks using a custom tool we discovered and have named\n\n Spellbinder. This tool uses IPv6 SLAAC spoofing to redirect traffic and\n\n deliver custom malware via software updates by legitimate applications.\n\n The tools developed by this group include two backdoors that we’ve named\n\n WizardNet and DarkNights.\n\n Since gambling is illegal under Chinese law and Chinese citizens thus\n\n turn to foreign online gambling companies, this would explain why\n\n TheWizards group spies on such companies, most likely to identify Chinese\n\n citizens infringing the law. This is not the first time we have witnessed\n\n a China-aligned APT group targeting gambling companies: Operation\n\n ChattyGoblin, which we mentioned in our previous APT activity report,\n\n compromised a gambling company in the Philippines by targeting its\n\n support agents.\n\n PerplexedGoblin\n\n ESET researchers recently discovered a government organization in\n\n the European Union being targeted by an APT group we have named\n\n PerplexedGoblin. It uses a backdoor, TurboSlate, that we discovered and\n\n named in November 2022.\n\n In our T3 2022 APT Activity Report, we mentioned the discovery of this\n\n new backdoor in a government organization in the European Union; it can\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 9 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n be deployed in various ways, including a DLL side-loading chain and a bring\n\n your own vulnerable software (BYOVS) chain. At that time, we attributed\n\n TurboSlate with medium confidence to Goblin Panda. However, after\n\n tracking the threat actor behind TurboSlate for months, we reevaluated our\n\n initial assessment: without a strong enough link between TurboSlate and a\n\n known group, we now track this activity cluster as PerplexedGoblin.\n\n Worok\n\n Worok is a China-aligned cyberespionage group, active since at least 2020,\n\n that targets high-profile companies and local governments mostly in Asia,\n\n which we first documented in a WeLiveSecurity blogpost.\n\n ESET researchers discovered a previously undocumented Go backdoor\n\n that we have named GoFighting and that we attribute to Worok.\n\n GoFighting is a reimplementation of Worok’s PowHeartBeat backdoor\n\n and the GoFighting commands are the same as the ones used by Worok’s\n\n PowHeartBeat backdoor. A noticeable difference from PowHeartBeat is the\n\n presence in GoFighting of a network fallback mechanism based on GitHub.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 10 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## India\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 11 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### Donot Team\n\n\n##### Summary of India-aligned APT group activity seen by ESET Research in April 2023 – September 2023\n\n\n###### During the last six months, we noticed most threat\n\n actors in the region moving away from malicious RTF\n\n (Rich Text Format) files and Equation Editor exploits,\n\n and trying to find new, reliable ways of distributing\n\n their malware. We detected attempts to use LNK\n\n (Windows shortcut) files, as well as CHM (Compiled\n\n HTML Help) and HTA (HTML Application) files, with\n\n varying degrees of success. The most prevalent\n\n compromise vector remains a spearphishing email with\n\n a macro-enabled Office document in the attachment.\n\n Considering the prevalent use of the Zimbra\n\n collaboration suite in this region, it is no surprise to see\n\n that frequent phishing attempts targeting government\n\n organizations continue (we've documented similar\n\n attacks in this WeLiveSecurity blogpost) in Q2 and Q3\n\n of 2023; most of them use free, dynamic DNS services,\n\n such as servehttp.com or viewdns.net, both owned\n\n by No-IP. We also have detected repeated phishing\n\n attempts imitating the Bangladesh Army Outlook Web\n\n Access portal; see Figure 3.\n\n\n###### Figure 3. Phishing page imitating the Bangladesh Army webmail portal\n\n\n###### Donot Team\n\n In the mobile threat landscape, we saw threat actors\n\n increasing their efforts and a continuing evolution\n\n of threats. Donot Team reportedly managed to\n\n publish its Android trojan on the Google Play store for\n\n approximately two months; however, the number of\n\n victims is estimated to be only in the low hundreds.\n\n Speaking of Donot Team, in Q2 and Q3 of 2023 it\n\n continued its attacks on government organizations,\n\n mostly in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The group’s yty\n\n framework is still being developed, with a steady\n\n stream of incremental updates.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 12 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## Iran\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 13 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n MuddyWater OilRig\n\n##### Summary of Iran-aligned APT group activity seen by ESET Research in April 2023 – September 2023\n\n\n###### Over the course of Q2 and Q3 2023, ESET researchers continued tracking\n\n Iran-aligned threat groups targeting victims in Israel (OilRig) and Saudi\n\n Arabia (MuddyWater). The latter group continues to build and deploy\n\n PowerShell-based backdoors with a focus on initial access and data\n\n collection, possibly as an access development team for a more advanced\n\n group. Finally, OilRig has been observed developing and deploying C++ and\n\n C#/.NET backdoors that are generally full-featured backdoors. Initial access\n\n for OilRig still seems to be via spearphishing emails, particularly when\n\n targeting local governments in Israel – an effort on which OilRig has spent\n\n considerable time going back to 2021.\n\n MuddyWater\n\n In March 2023, prior to the attack on the Israel Institute of Technology\n\n (aka Technion) by DarkBit (a joint effort between MuddyWater and an\n\n unidentified group), ESET researchers were tracking the C&C infrastructure\n\n used by DarkBit as MuddyWater’s. After that ransomware attack,\n\n MuddyWater continued well into April to use the same C&C servers\n\n to target an unidentified victim in Saudi Arabia. The initial vector of\n\n compromise is unknown, but post-compromise activities included the\n\n deployment of a batch script that downloaded a second payload from the\n\n1 SHA-1: C9D18D01E1EC96BE952A9D7BD78F6BBB4DD2AA2A\n\n\n###### C&C servers. The secondary payload, a PowerShell-based backdoor, can\n\n download and execute arbitrary payloads. It removes the first payload from\n\n disk, performs some information gathering on the compromised host, and\n\n begins beaconing to the C&C server every 10 seconds.\n\n OilRig\n\n In April, we observed OilRig deploying a new toolset to several victims in\n\n Israel. The backdoor, OilForceGTX (named after its filename, gtx.exe), is\n\n deployed in C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA GTX\\v10.1, a path that mimics\n\n legitimate NVIDIA software. OilRig also deployed two helper DLLs,\n\n NotifyTrayLib and Nuget_Tools, to the same directory. These DLLs are\n\n meant to provide runtime support in the form of additional modules for\n\n OilForceGTX to evade detection. In conjunction with this discovery, we also\n\n uncovered a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with a malicious macro that drops\n\n OilForceGTX, along with the original email used to deliver the spreadsheet.\n\n Both files were uploaded to VirusTotal by a user in Israel. Based on the\n\n upload location and content, we assess that OilRig was probably targeting\n\n a local government institution in Israel, which aligns closely with OilRig\n\n activity over the past two years.\n\n\n###### In early July, we observed a new variant of OilRig’s backdoor, Mango, that\n\n was uploaded to VirusTotal[1] by a user in the Netherlands. Five additional\n\n samples were submitted within the following week, mostly with the\n\n file path %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Office356\\Menorah. The sample is a\n\n C#/.NET first-stage backdoor and contains small updates to the first version\n\n of Mango that we discovered in early 2023. Both versions support the same\n\n capabilities, with only small changes in the implementation and constants.\n\n Some interesting changes are the changing of the filename and internal\n\n name of the assembly from Mango to Menorah and the modification of the\n\n symbol names throughout the code, probably using an obfuscator/name\n\n generator. The C&C server was updated, but the URL structure, encryption\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 14 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## Middle East\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 15 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### POLONIUM\n\n\n##### Summary of Middle Eastern APT group activity seen by ESET Research in April 2023 – September 2023\n\n###### POLONIUM\n\n POLONIUM continues to field PowerShell-based backdoors, but also uses\n\n Python-based backdoors with a heavy focus on exploiting victims in Israel\n\n for espionage and data theft.\n\n In April, we observed POLONIUM deploying a new backdoor, CreepyPie,\n\n to an unidentified organization in Israel. CreepyPie is a Python script that\n\n connects to a remote C&C server, receives and executes commands, and\n\n sends the output back to the C&C server. The attackers used a short\n\n VBScript to invoke CreepyPie, probably persisting in compromised systems\n\n by executing the VBScript from a scheduled task.\n\n CreepyPie uses the WebSocket protocol to communicate with its C&C\n\n server. Operator command options include taking a screenshot (saved\n\n as GameTools.png) and any command accessible through cmd.exe\n\n (with output saved as a plain text file that is misleadingly named\n\n GameTools.dll).\n\n POLONIUM continues to rely on the CreepySnail backdoor to target victims\n\n in Israel. We also saw the group utilize legitimate utilities such as \n\n ntdsutil.exe – a command line tool for managing Active Directory –\n\n to dump the Active Directory database. CreepySnail can then be used to\n\n extract such information from the compromised system.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 16 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## North Korea\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 17 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n Andariel Lazarus ScarCruft Kimsuky Konni\n\n##### Summary of North Korea-aligned APT group activity seen by ESET Research in April 2023 – September 2023\n\n\n###### During the last six months, ESET researchers continued to track the\n\n development of several North Korea-aligned threat actors. Andariel and\n\n ScarCruft both targeted Japanese institutions, while most of the observed\n\n Lazarus activities were associated with the Operation DreamJob cluster.\n\n We also continued to investigate the use of the SimpleTea malware family:\n\n a common code base used by the Lazarus group to create malware for all\n\n major desktop OS platforms: Windows, Linux, and macOS. Finally, Kimsuky\n\n continued its targeting of international scholars and journalists specializing\n\n in North Korea, and Konni remained active in South Korea.\n\n Andariel\n\n In late May 2023, we observed an attack against an industrial network\n\n in Japan, conducted by the Andariel group. Various custom tools were\n\n deployed, such as an infostealer we have named Shoplifter, capable\n\n of logging keystrokes, stealing clipboard content, and exfiltrating the\n\n file system structure. Interestingly, the attackers also deployed AutoIt\n\n malware with very similar capabilities. Finally, we also observed a simple\n\n HTTP downloader capable of retrieving AES-128-encrypted payloads, and\n\n SpyXstealer, a custom tool used to steal browser data such as passwords\n\n and credit card information.\n\n2 SHA-1: CB123A197A3BAA8865A3CA2CEE25022D0A578371\n\n3 SHA-1: 744A816A4D9FBC0B358500B25E6F5AFD7B52C718\n\n\n###### In general, the attackers’ TTPs still include the easy-to-detect usage\n\n of native Windows command prompt tools in order to perform\n\n reconnaissance and lateral movement.\n\n Lazarus\n\n We saw activity mostly belonging to the Operation DreamJob cluster in\n\n this period. In April 2023, we wrote about new Linux malware, OdicLoader\n\n and SimplexTea, in connection with the infamous 3CX supply-chain attack.\n\n OdicLoader is an ELF downloader responsible for fetching and executing\n\n the SimplexTea Linux backdoor from the OpenDrive cloud service. At the\n\n time, we did not know that the code used to compile the SimplexTea Linux\n\n backdoor was in fact part of a common Lazarus code base used for all\n\n major desktop platforms: Windows, Linux, and macOS. After discovering\n\n this commonality, we decided to use the SimpleTea name for all malware\n\n derived from this common code base, even if there are slight variations in\n\n their functionalities.\n\n In September, a user from Slovenia submitted a new variant of OdicLoader[2]\n\n to VirusTotal . While the variant discussed in our blogpost was disguised\n\n as an HSBC-themed job offer, this one has a MultiLayerSwap theme.\n\n\n###### MultiLayerSwap appeared to be a cryptocurrency trading platform offering\n\n instant transfers across different blockchains. However, MultiLayerSwap did\n\n not appear very trustworthy and after a brief examination we concluded\n\n that it is a copycat of a legitimate cBridge project by CelerNetworks. This\n\n highlights Lazarus’s ongoing targeting of cryptocurrency-related entities.\n\n We also continued to observe Lazarus using macOS payloads against its\n\n targets. Samples of SimpleTea for macOS were uploaded to VirusTotal[3]\n\n from Hong Kong and China, and we also discovered a macOS WebbyTea\n\n downloader. Its associated Python loader has code to pick a payload\n\n according to the OS it is executed on: Windows, Linux, or Darwin (the core\n\n Unix system of macOS). This illustrates again the capability and willingness\n\n of the Lazarus group to attack all major operating systems.\n\n ScarCruft\n\n In this period, ScarCruft continued to target entities in South Korea, but\n\n also in Japan. It still relies on Ruby scripts in some of its campaigns, but also\n\n the RokRAT backdoor.\n\n In September, a ZIP archive containing a malicious LNK file named\n\n Korea National Intelligence Society 2023 Summer Academic\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 18 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### Conference and 5th National Strategy\n\n Colloquium (Final) - Korea's national\n\n security and intelligence in a period of\n\n great transition.lnk was uploaded to VirusTotal[4]\n\n from South Korea.\n\n Once executed, a decoy PDF is opened (see Figure 4)\n\n and shellcode is downloaded from OneDrive. At the\n\n time of analysis, the server responded with shellcode\n\n containing the RokRAT backdoor, illustrating the\n\n continuing usage of this backdoor by ScarCruft.\n\n Kimsuky\n\n Kimsuky adjusted its approaches and, like many other\n\n threat actors, started to utilize tools such as OneNote,\n\n Compiled HTML Help (CHM), and Windows shortcut\n\n (LNK) files in its campaigns. The group also rewrote\n\n some of its malware in Go to evade detections and to\n\n get the upper hand against security solutions.\n\n Kimsuky’s most notable activity is its continuation of a\n\n spearphishing campaign targeting analysts, academic\n\n scholars, researchers, and journalists who focus on\n\n North Korean matters. In this campaign, Kimsuky\n\n impersonates someone from a relevant community\n\n and distributes high-quality spearphishing emails,\n\n in the person’s name, to other selected members of\n\n that community. This enables Kimsuky to gain the\n\n trust of its targets. Often, Kimsuky continues with\n\n the communication in a predefined way to establish\n\n4 SHA-1: 0105234C9FB904CC4BFD6EC0E1E78163B2F5825C\n\n5 SHA-1: E0795C874BD9BBDF71C10164C483357F759CB41E\n\n\n###### files containing BAT and VBS downloaders. Very similar\n\n compromise chains have also been reported to be used\n\n by the other North Korea-aligned APT groups Kimsuky\n\n (text in Chinese) and ScarCruft. The campaign’s initial\n\n payload filenames mention taxes, salaries, or contracts,\n\n such as .hwp.lnk 국세청 종합소득세 해명자료 제출 안내\n (machine translation: Information on submitting\n\n comprehensive income tax explanation\n\n materials to the National Tax Service)\n\n and .txt.lnk (machine translation: 법인렌탈계약서\n Corporate rental contract).\n\n Interestingly, we detected an attempt by Konni to\n\n abuse a recent WinRAR vulnerability: CVE 2023\n 38831. A crafted, misnamed ZIP file (wallet_\n\n Screenshot_2023_09_06_Qbao_Network.rar)\n\n containing a decoy HTML page as well as a malicious\n\n executable – a downloader – was uploaded to\n\n VirusTotal[5]. The decoy document contains screenshots\n\n of a Qbao cryptocurrency wallet; see Figure 5. Figure 4. Decoy PDF document Figure 5. Decoy document screenshot of a Qbao cryptocurrency wallet\n PDF document\n\n\n###### rapport with the target. Once a certain point in the\n\n communication is reached, Kimsuky sends a malicious\n\n attachment or link to the target. The intention is either\n\n to compromise the target’s machine or to harvest\n\n credentials through a fake website mimicking a known\n\n service. The ultimate goal of the campaigns is usually\n\n to gather strategic intelligence.\n\n\n###### Konni\n\n Konni ran several finance-themed campaigns targeting\n\n South Korea. The compromise chain consisted of\n\n spearphishing emails with a link to a ZIP file that\n\n contains a malicious LNK file. If the LNK file is executed,\n\n it runs PowerShell code that extracts both the decoy\n\n document and the actual payload from data appended\n\n to the LNK file. The payloads are commonly CAB or ZIP\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 19 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## Russia\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 20 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n Sandworm Gamaredon Turla Sednit\n##### Summary of Russia-aligned APT group activity seen by ESET Research in April 2023 – September 2023\n\n\n###### Gamaredon\n\n In the current reporting period, Gamaredon significantly improved its\n\n intelligence collecting capabilities. Specifically, it extended the functionality\n\n of existing tools and developed and deployed new tools to collect even\n\n more data from compromised computers.\n\n In April, we discovered a new version of the PteroSteal credential stealer,\n\n which is now capable of stealing credentials, and other information related\n\n to email accounts, stored by the email clients Outlook and The Bat!.\n\n In June, we discovered several new tools:\n\n • [PteroCookie, which is capable of stealing cookies from Opera, Firefox, ] Chrome, and Edge.\n\n\n###### During the past six months, ESET researchers continued to observe activity\n\n of Russia-aligned APT groups mostly targeting Ukraine and EU countries.\n\n These groups include Sandworm, Gamaredon, Turla, and Sednit, with\n\n Gamaredon being the group most active in targeting Ukraine.\n\n Sandworm\n\n In April 2023, CERT-UA published a notification about a cyberattack\n\n conducted by Sandworm against a government institution in Ukraine.\n\n Attackers deployed a malicious BAT script (named RoarBat), which performs\n\n data wiping operations using a legitimate WinRAR application. The script\n\n uses WinRAR.exe in command line mode to move files into an archive, and\n\n then deletes the original files once they have been added to the archive.\n\n In June 2023, we discovered another variant of RoarBat, deployed in a media\n\n organization in Ukraine, which is slightly different: specifically, it targets\n\n media files with extensions such as .drawio, .jfif, .mkv, .avi, .mxf, and\n\n .MTS, which are commonly found at media organizations.\n\n In July 2023, we detected two data wiping attacks conducted by Sandworm\n\n using a new version of NikoWiper[6]. This wiper was deployed against a\n\n government organization and private companies. It abuses a legitimate\n\n6 SHA-1: BBB7D42ADB6C6F6D3FEE3F80BEBD8CBED7FC3A94\n\n\n###### command line utility for secure file deletion, SDelete (Secure Delete). \n\n The functionality is like the older NikoWiper variant used in October 2022:\n\n at that time it was used against a company in the energy sector in Ukraine.\n\n In this variant of NikoWiper, the attackers left the PDB path \n\n c:\\Users\\Mykyta\\Desktop\\prjs\\Chelomey\\Release\\Chelomey.pdb,\n\n which reveals that this malware project is probably named after Vladimir\n\n Chelomey, an engineer and designer in the missile program of the former\n\n Soviet Union. In addition, attackers left a false flag: they used the Ukrainian\n\n given name Mykyta rather than the same Russian name Nikita.\n\n In August 2023, we detected a new wiper that we named SharpNikoWiper.\n\n SharpNikoWiper abuses the legitimate SDelete command line utility, as\n\n does NikoWiper, but unlike NikoWiper this variant is written in C#, hence\n\n\n###### the name SharpNikoWiper. In addition to data wiping using SDelete, this\n\n wiper attempts to rewrite with zeros the first 65,536 bytes of the first ten\n\n connected hard drives, if they exist, by writing directly to \n\n \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive<DRIVE_NUMBER>.\n\n During this period, we observed that Sandworm used a pro-Russian\n\n Telegram channel (@solntsepekZ) to promote information about\n\n cybersabotage operations it had conducted. This Telegram channel\n\n attempts groundlessly to blame CERT-UA and discredit its reputation.\n\n\n\n###### • [PteroSig, which is designed to exfiltrate information stored by the Signal ] desktop application.\n\n • [PteroGram, which exfiltrates data from the Telegram Desktop ] application.\n\n In August we discovered two new Gamaredon tools. First, PteroBleed is\n\n designed to exfiltrate IndexedDB data from Opera, Chrome, and Edge\n\n browsers. This tool specifically looks for data stored in this database by web\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 21 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n\n###### versions of Telegram and WhatsApp applications, and for data that might\n\n be used by various Ukrainian military web services. The second tool we\n\n discovered that month is PteroScout, which is used for reconnaissance. It\n\n gathers detailed information about the compromised system.\n\n Turla\n\n In July 2023, CERT-UA published a technical analysis of a new implant\n\n named CAPIBAR that it attributes to Turla. Using ESET telemetry, we were\n\n able to detect the deployment of CAPIBAR not only in Ukraine but also\n\n in Greece and Guyana. Most victims are governmental entities, a typical\n\n target of Turla.\n\n We believe that the initial access vector used to deploy the server\n\n component, acting as a C&C server for other victims, is known RCE\n\n vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange such as ProxyLogon and ProxyShell.\n\n Sednit\n\n In June 2023, we discovered a set of spearphishing campaigns, which we\n\n named Operation RoundPress, exploiting an XSS vulnerability in Roundcube\n\n (CVE-2020-35730); see an example in Figure 6. Using this vulnerability,\n\n attackers are able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the victim’s\n\n Roundcube webmail server. The injected code is able to steal emails,\n\n address books, and create forwarding rules to steal incoming emails. This\n\n campaign was also documented by CERT-UA and Recorded Future.\n\n According to our telemetry, Operation RoundPress targets government\n\n staff in Armenia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine.\n\n In August and September 2023, we detected an updated version of\n\n Operation RoundPress spearphishing, exploiting the same XSS vulnerability.\n\n\n###### Figure 6. Spearphishing email used in Operation RoundPress\n\n This campaign was targeting organizations in Serbia, Greece, Poland, and\n\n Ukraine.\n\n In August 2023, we detected a Sednit spearphishing campaign targeting the\n\n CVE-2023-38831 WinRAR vulnerability. This vulnerability allows attackers\n\n to execute arbitrary code with WinRAR versions prior to v6.23. According\n\n to Group-IB, it has been used in the wild since April 2023 by crimeware\n\n threat actors against traders. Sednit’s emails used the agenda of the\n\n European parliament as a lure (see Figure 7) and targeted political entities\n\n in the EU and Ukraine.\n\n In August 2023, we detected a new set of spearphishing emails used by\n\n Sednit that exploit the CVE-2023-23397 vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook\n\n\n###### for Windows. This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger an NTLM\n\n authentication request to an attacker-controlled server by sending a\n\n specially crafted meeting invite. Initially, this was a zero-day vulnerability\n\n disclosed in March 2023. A newer campaign was targeting organizations in\n\n Ukraine, Poland, and Czechia.\n\n Figure 7. Targeted phishing using the European Parliament agenda as a lure\n\n In September 2023, CERT-UA published a notification about a Sednit\n\n spearphishing campaign, whose execution chain relies on the user manually\n\n clicking on a link in the email, which opens an archive, and then executes\n\n a BAT script from that archive. To the best of our knowledge, this was a\n\n completely manual execution chain, relying on the lure to motivate the user\n\n to click on the malicious BAT script.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 22 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n## Other\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 23 Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n SturgeonPhisher Winter Vivern\n\n##### Other notable APT activities\n\n\n###### Dear Colleagues,\n\n\n###### In this section, we review notable activities from\n\n groups with as yet unknown alignments.\n\n SturgeonPhisher\n\n SturgeonPhisher is a cyberespionage group that we\n\n first introduced in our previous APT activity report\n\n and that mainly targets governments in Central Asia.\n\n In that earlier report we mentioned that we observed\n\n a decline of SturgeonPhisher activity and we assessed\n\n that the group was busy retooling.\n\n This actually happened in the following months and\n\n we observed new variants of the group’s Telegram\n\n backdoor, now developed in PowerShell and Go,\n\n in addition to the usual Python variant based on\n\n pyTelegramBotAPI.\n\n In late August 2023, SturgeonPhisher jumped on the\n\n WinRAR CVE-2023-38831 vulnerability bandwagon to\n\n target individuals in Tajikistan. A ZIP archive was sent\n\n as an attachment and attempts to exploit the CVE\n 2023-38831 vulnerability. If it succeeds, or if the user\n\n clicks on the 27885.pdf.cmd file the archive contains,\n\n additional malware will be downloaded from ​\n\n\n###### https://akn[.]tj/down/Winrar.rar. Then it extracts\n\n and executes the next stage contained in this second\n\n archive: a .NET dropper and a custom Go backdoor we\n\n named GoBatDoor.\n\n Winter Vivern\n\n Winter Vivern is a cyberespionage group that we\n\n mentioned in our previous APT activity report.\n\n In particular, it exploited an XSS vulnerability,\n\n CVE-2022-27926, in the Zimbra portal to target at least\n\n two different governmental organizations in Europe.\n\n In late August 2023, we detected a wave of\n\n spearphishing emails against a Ukrainian governmental\n\n entity. The email was intended to exploit an XSS\n\n vulnerability in Roundcube (CVE-2020-35730). Note\n\n that the same vulnerability is currently being exploited\n\n by Sednit in Operation RoundPress.\n\n The email messages were probably sent from\n\n a compromised email address; their subject is\n\n Important warning on maintenance, and the body\n\n is the following:\n\n\n###### Due to the planned technical work, the\n\n Ministry's mail server https://<redacted>.\n\n gov.ua/ may temporarily not respond to user\n\n\n###### requests.\n\n\n\n###### [WebResource:<script type=ext/\n\n\n###### javascript\">eval(atob('<base64-encoded\n\n payload>'));</script>]:##str_replacement_0##\n\n\n###### Best regards,\n\n\n###### <redacted>\n\n If the webmail server is vulnerable, JavaScript code will\n\n be executed in the context of the browser, leading to\n\n the display of a fake Roundcube login window that\n\n exfiltrates to its C&C server whatever credentials a\n\n victim might enter.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ESET APT ACTIVITY REPORT APRIL - SEPTEMBER 2023 | 24\n Executive summary     Targeted countries and verticals     China     India     Iran     Middle East     North Korea     Russia     Other     About ESET\n\n### About ESET\n\n\n###### For more than 30 years, ESET® has been developing\n\n industry-leading IT security software and services to\n\n deliver comprehensive, multilayered protection against\n\n cybersecurity threats for businesses and consumers\n\n worldwide.
