The new great\npower game is digital, with the shadowy alleys and cafes of Cold War spy games replaced by\nmassive data breaches and compromising corporate security. Some strategies see this world\n[as dominated by offensive operations—but the SolarWinds case suggests the opposite. The](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint)\n[U.S. Cyber Solarium Commission, on which we served, found that the future of cybersecurity](https://www.solarium.gov/report)\n[strategy will come to rely on layered cyber deterrence to enable defensive denial operations,](https://www.lawfareblog.com/layered-cyber-deterrence-strategy-securing-connectivity-21st-century)\ninternational entanglement and cost imposition when aggressors defy the norms of the\ninternational system. The SolarWinds hack emphasizes the importance of implementing this\nstrategy.\n\nIt’s simpler to list the [agencies that have not been caught up in the SolarWinds infiltration,](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/946776718/what-we-know-about-russias-latest-alleged-hack-of-the-u-s-government)\n[which was run by Russian hacking group APT29 under the umbrella of the Russian](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/russia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html)\n[intelligence services, the SVR. So far, only the intelligence community has not been reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/russia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nto have been breached.\n\nThe goal of the operation seems to have been exfiltrating data and digital tools from the\n[targets. The attackers leveraged a supply chain vulnerability in the ubiquitous SolarWinds](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/unraveling-network-infrastructure-linked-to-the-solarwinds-hack)\n[Orion program, a network monitoring tool, to insert backdoors into an update released](https://www.solarwinds.com/solutions/orion)\nmonths ago. Once inside the networks, the attackers were able to maintain a permanent\npresence. The operation was so devastating that SolarWinds employees appear to have\n[engaged in a massive sell-off of stocks prior to public disclosure of the vulnerability.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/15/solarwinds-russia-breach-stock-trades/)\n\nThe impact of the operation is currently unknown. Overall, the likely outcome seems similar\nto that of the Office of Personal Management (OPM) hack of 2015, which resulted in the\n[massive theft of unclassified government data by China but without any clear use of the data](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/)\nby Beijing in the subsequent years. But the SolarWinds breach will have second- and thirdorder effects. Already, [FireEye’s Red Team tools have been stolen through the SolarWinds](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/unauthorized-access-of-fireeye-red-team-tools.html)\nvulnerability and reused by the attackers on other systems. The key thing to remember at\nthis point is that the operation seems likely to be able to extract information but not insert or\ndestroy data within government systems.\n\nThe SolarWinds operation demonstrates the developing nature of modern great power\n[competition, where rival states employ cyber strategies to steal secrets as well as to conduct](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190618094.001.0001/oso-9780190618094)\nlimited operations meant to disrupt and degrade. Though media reports often characterize\ncyber operations as attacks, many operations are better thought of as instruments of political\nwarfare and [weak forms of coercion that do not seek destruction. Most cases involve stolen](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2017.1306396)\ndata or limited disruptive effects. There appear to be key [firebreaks that limit escalation in](https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/5/1/tyz007/5575971)\n[cyberspace, keeping it a realm of covert and clandestine operations as opposed to decisive](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691181769/secret-wars)\nbattles.\n\n[We have worked with Ryan Maness of the Naval Postgraduate School to compile the Dyadic](https://nps.edu/faculty-profiles/-/cv/rmaness)\nCyber Incident Dispute Dataset (DCID), which tracks all known cyber actions between rival\nnation-states from 2001 through 2016. Based on an examination of the SolarWinds operation\nalongside the other operations in this dataset, the operation appears similar to past Russian\nand Chinese network infiltrations like the aforementioned OPM hack or APT29’s prior\n[operations against the State Department and other government agencies. Great powers use](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-details-emerge-about-2014-russian-hack-of-the-state-department-it-was-hand-to-hand-combat/2017/04/03/d89168e0-124c-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html)\ncyberspace to alter the balance of information and gain an advantage in long-term\ncompetition. In this manner, espionage supports broader coercive campaigns and crisis\nbargaining, helping each side either signal in the shadows or determine the capabilities and\nresolve of its rival.\n\nThe SolarWinds operation demonstrates that U.S. Cyber Command’s vision of persistent\nengagement, which calls for preventively imposing costs on adversaries to shape\n[competition in cyberspace, appears not to have worked as expected. Persistent engagement](https://www.cybercom.mil/Portals/56/Documents/USCYBERCOM%20Vision%20April%202018.pdf?ver=2018-06-14-152556-010)\nand hunting forward on Russian networks apparently did not do enough to change the costbenefit or risk calculations of Russian hackers targeting U.S. networks and did not dissuade\nMoscow from conducting one of the largest data heists in history. This dynamic played out\n\n\n-----\n\nsimilarly with respect to election hacking. Despite actions aligned with the persistent\nengagement posture to stop foreign groups from waging sophisticated social media\n[campaigns and probe U.S. election infrastructure, Russia, China and Iran all were caught](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/10/russia-china-iran-cyberhack-2020-election-411853)\ntrying to interfere with U.S. domestic politics.\n\nPunishment strategies—that is, strategies seeking to impose costs—which include constant\noperations as a matter of public policy are self-defeating in cyberspace, because there is no\nwider conception of how the adversary will react. Hunting forward in operation is no\nguarantee of preemptively disrupting ongoing operations—and it does not impose clear\nsignaled costs on the opposition, as is needed to dissuade limited cyber operations in the\nrealm of espionage.\n\nIn the future, what is required is a deeper focus on denial-based approaches: How can the\nU.S. limit the attack surfaces available to the opposition and harden targets to ensure\nresilience? The goal should be to make it more difficult for states to launch sophisticated,\nwidespread cyber intrusions—and this can be done by reducing the attack surfaces available\nto the opposition.\n\nThat logic is at the core of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which called for\nimplementing a new approach: layered cyber deterrence. Layered deterrence implies three\ncoordinated sets of activities that work together to alter the cost-benefit calculation of\nlaunching large cyberattacks against American interests. There is no way to stop all activity\nin cyberspace, just as there is no way to stop all espionage, but it’s possible to make this\nactivity more costly—thus decreasing the severity and frequency of attacks.\n\nThrough [entanglement strategies that seek to leverage international institutions, regulatory](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00266)\nbodies and international law, the U.S. government works with partners, allies and\ninternational organizations to share information and facilitate global efforts to isolate and\nprosecute state officials and criminals linked to nefarious cyber activity. In the denial layer,\nU.S. government officials build deeper relationships with the private sector, harmonizing\nregulation and creating incentives to build security into networks. This requires collecting and\nstandardizing data, as well as continual tests and validation to create a more functional cyber\ninsurance marketplace.\n\nLayered deterrence preserves the capability and capacity to defend forward and conduct\ntargeted operations that signal capabilities and resolve. Because cyber operations take place\nin the shadows, this requires deliberate signaling and demonstrating network resilience—\nwhich can be accomplished through actions such as establishing and testing continuity of\ngovernment and economy procedures in the event of a massive attack. Rival states need to\nknow the United States is testing and hardening its networks.\n\nImplementing layered cyber deterrence requires extensive executive and legislative action.\nThe [National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA), currently sitting on the](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20201207/CRPT-116hrpt617.pdf)\npresident’s desk, contains a number of provisions that can help address incidents like this.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo provide strategic leadership on cybersecurity from the White House, Section 1752 of the\nNDAA establishes a Senate-confirmed national cyber director within the White House to\nserve as the president’s principal cyber adviser, ensure agency compliance with federal\npolicies, and lead interagency cyber contingency planning and incident response. The bill\nalso contains several provisions that speak directly to preventing an event like SolarWinds.\nSection 1705, “Strengthening Federal Networks,” authorizes the Cybersecurity and\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to conduct threat hunting on federal networks (that is,\neverything ending in .gov). Section 1715 establishes a Joint Cyber Planning Office under\nCISA, to facilitate comprehensive planning of defensive cybersecurity campaigns across\nfederal agencies and with the private sector. Section 1745 tasks the secretary of homeland\nsecurity to conduct a comprehensive review of CISA’s ability to fulfill its current missions and\nrecommend appropriate authorities and resources to get the agency mission ready.\n\nFinally, to better respond to a hack like SolarWinds, Section 1716 grants administrative\nsubpoena authority to CISA so that the agency can identify vulnerable systems and notify\npublic and private system owners. And Section 1731 directs the executive branch to submit a\nreport to Congress evaluating the federal cybersecurity centers and the potential for better\ncoordination of federal cybersecurity efforts at a properly functioning integrated cybersecurity\ncenter within CISA.\n\nThe Biden administration should embrace these changes established by the NDAA and\nensure their swift implementation. Beyond this, however, the Biden team also needs to\npursue efforts to build a more effective defensive effort to deny adversaries the ability to\nexecute hacks like SolarWinds. This will involve not only improving the federal government’s\ncybersecurity readiness but also building the elusive public-private collaboration on critical\ninfrastructure protection that has eluded the past four administrations.\n\nTopics:\n\n[Cybersecurity and Deterrence](https://www.lawfareblog.com/topic/cybersecurity-and-deterrence)\n\nDr. Benjamin Jensen is a Senior Research Director and leads the Strategic Initiative Group\nwith the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission.
