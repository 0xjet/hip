If convicted on all counts, he faces a maximum penalty of 17 years in federal\nprison. The indictment also notifies Ivanov-Tolpintsev that the United States intends to forfeit\n$82,648, which is alleged to be traceable to proceeds of the offenses.\n\nIvanov-Tolpintsev was taken into custody by Polish authorities in Korczowa, Poland, on\nOctober 3, 2020, and extradited to the United States pursuant to the extradition treaty\nbetween the United States and the Republic of Poland. Ivanov-Tolpintsev was presented on\nSeptember 7, 2021, before United States Magistrate Julie S. Sneed, and ordered detained\npending trial.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to the [indictment, Ivanov-Tolpintsev controlled a botnet, which is a network of](https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/press-release/file/1431116/download)\ncomputers infected with malware and controlled as a group without the owners’ knowledge.\nHe used the botnet to conduct brute-force attacks designed to decrypt numerous computer\nlogin credentials simultaneously. During the course of the conspiracy, Ivanov-Tolpintsev\nstated that his botnet was capable of decrypting the login credentials of at least 2,000\ncomputers every week. Ivanov-Tolpintsev then sold these login credentials on a dark web\nwebsite that specialized in the purchase and sale of access to compromised computers.\nOnce sold on this website, credentials were used to facilitate a wide range of illegal activity,\nincluding tax fraud and ransomware attacks.\n\nAn indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed one or more\nviolations of federal criminal law, and every defendant is presumed innocent unless, and\nuntil, proven guilty.\n\nThe investigation was led by the Tampa Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the\nInternal Revenue Service—Criminal Investigation’s Tampa Field Office, and Homeland\nSecurity Investigations - Tampa Division. Substantial assistance was provided by the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of International Affairs and the Internal Revenue Service—\nCriminal Investigation Cyber Crimes Unit in Washington, D.C. This investigation also\nbenefited from foreign law enforcement cooperation by the Polish National Police, the Polish\nProsecutor’s Office, and the Polish Ministry of Justice. It will be prosecuted by Assistant\nUnited States Attorney Carlton C. Gammons.\n\nAttachment(s):\n\n[Download Indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/press-release/file/1431116/download)\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\nComponent(s):\n\n[USAO - Florida, Middle](http://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl)\n\n\n-----",
