    "plain_text": "# Cyberattacks targeting health care must stop\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum/)**\n\nNovember 13, 2020\n\nTwo global issues will help shape people’s memories of this time in history – Covid-19 and\nthe increased use of the internet by malign actors to disrupt society. It’s disturbing that these\nchallenges have now merged as cyberattacks are being used to disrupt health care\norganizations fighting the pandemic. We think these attacks are unconscionable and should\nbe condemned by all civilized society. Today, we’re sharing more about the attacks we’ve\nseen most recently and are urging governments to act.\n\nIn recent months, we’ve detected cyberattacks from three nation-state actors targeting seven\nprominent companies directly involved in researching vaccines and treatments for Covid-19.\nThe targets include leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers in Canada,\nFrance, India, South Korea and the United States. The attacks came from Strontium, an\nactor originating from Russia, and two actors originating from North Korea that we call Zinc\nand Cerium.\n\nAmong the targets, the majority are vaccine makers that have Covid-19 vaccines in various\nstages of clinical trials. One is a clinical research organization involved in trials, and one has\ndeveloped a Covid-19 test. Multiple organizations targeted have contracts with or\ninvestments from government agencies from various democratic countries for Covid-19\nrelated work.\n\n\n-----\n\nStrontium continues to use password spray and brute force login attempts to steal login\ncredentials. These are attacks that aim to break into people’s accounts using thousands or\nmillions of rapid attempts. Zinc has primarily used spear-phishing lures for credential theft,\nsending messages with fabricated job descriptions pretending to be recruiters. Cerium\nengaged in spear-phishing email lures using Covid-19 themes while masquerading as World\nHealth Organization representatives. The majority of these attacks were blocked by security\nprotections built into our products. We’ve notified all organizations targeted, and where\nattacks have been successful, we’ve offered help.\n\nThese are just among the most recent attacks on those combating Covid-19. Cyberattacks\ntargeting the health care sector and taking advantage of the pandemic are not new.\n[Attackers recently used ransomware attacks to target hospitals and healthcare organizations](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/more-hospitals-hit-ransomware-feds-warn-about-cyberattacks-n1245292)\nacross the United States. Earlier in the pandemic, attacks targeted Brno University\n[Hospital in the Czech Republic, Paris’s hospital system, the computer systems of](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-23/paris-hospitals-target-of-failed-cyber-attack-authority-says) Spain’s\nhospitals, hospitals in [Thailand, medical clinics in the U.S. state of Texas, a health care](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/03/5-times-more-coronavirus-themed-malware-reports-during-march/)\nagency [in the U.S. state of Illinois and even international bodies such as the World Health](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/487282-illinois-public-health-agencys-website-taken-down-by-hackers)\nOrganization. In Germany, we recently saw the resulting threat to human health become\n[tragic reality when a woman in Dusseldorf reportedly became the first known death as a](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/world/europe/cyber-attack-germany-ransomeware-death.html)\nresult of a cyberattack on a hospital.\n\nToday, Microsoft’s president Brad Smith is participating in the Paris Peace Forum where he\nwill urge governments to do more. Microsoft is calling on the world’s leaders to affirm that\ninternational law protects health care facilities and to take action to enforce the law. We\nbelieve the law should be enforced not just when attacks originate from government\nagencies but also when they originate from criminal groups that governments enable to\noperate – or even facilitate – within their borders. This is criminal activity that cannot be\ntolerated.\n\nThe good news is that we’re not alone. Our voice at Microsoft is just one of many speaking\nup from the multi-stakeholder coalition that will be needed to make progress. In today’s\nvirtual Paris Peace Forum event addressing an audience of international leaders, Brad will\ndiscuss these issues with France’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves le Drian,\nAmbassador Guilherme de Aguiar Patriota of Brazil and Ambassador Jürg Lauber of\n[Switzerland. Ambassador Patriota is chair of the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts, and](https://www.un.org/disarmament/group-of-governmental-experts/)\nAmbassador Lauber is chair of the UN’s [Open-Ended Working Group – both important](https://www.un.org/disarmament/open-ended-working-group/)\nbodies in determining the future of cyberspace.\n\nIn the leadup to this year’s Paris Peace Forum, more than 65 health care-related\n[organizations have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. They include](https://pariscall.international/en/)\norganizations like Merck working on vaccines, top hospitals like Hospital Metropolitano in\nEcuador, and government health institutes like Poland’s National Institute of Public Health.\nThere is no question the attacks we’ve seen in recent months are creating energy for action\n\n\n-----\n\nacross the health sector. The Paris Call remains the largest multi-stakeholder coalition\naddressing these issues, and its first principle is the prevention of malicious cyber activities\nthat threaten indiscriminate or systemic harm to people and critical infrastructure.\n\nIn May, a 136-strong group of the world’s most prominent international law experts, in what\n[has become known as the Oxford Process, issued a statement making it clear that](https://www.elac.ox.ac.uk/the-oxford-statement-on-the-international-law-protections-against-cyber-operations-targeting-the-hea)\ninternational law protects medical facilities at all times. In August, the Oxford Process issued\na [second statement emphasizing that organizations that research, manufacture and](https://www.elac.ox.ac.uk/article/the-second-oxford-statement)\ndistribute of Covid-19 vaccines are also protected.\n\nEarlier this year, the [CyberPeace Institute and International Committee of the Red Cross led](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/)\nan effort by 40 international leaders calling on governments to stop the attacks on\nhealthcare. They included former secretary of state Madeline Albright, Archbishop Emeritus\nof Cape Town Desmond Tutu, former Member of the European Parliament Marietje Schaake\nand former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon among many others.\n\nOrganizations are also taking steps to protect themselves. In April, we announced that we\nwere making AccountGuard, our threat notification service, available to health care and\nhuman rights organizations working on Covid-19. Since then 195 of these organizations have\nenrolled in the service and we now protect 1.7 million email accounts for health care-related\n[groups. Any health care-related organizations that wish to enroll can do so here.](https://www.microsoftaccountguard.com/healthcare/)\n\nAt a time when the world is united in wanting an end to the pandemic and anxiously awaiting\nthe development of a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19, it is essential for world leaders\nto unite around the security of our health care institutions and enforce the law against\ncyberattacks targeting those who endeavor to help us all.
