The campaign, first observed in midDecember, carries pharmaceutical-themed invoices that contain references to a series of\nwebsites hosted on the “shop” domain but that were down at the time of initial analysis. They\nwere classified by the PDC as malicious because of the phone numbers used on\nthe invoices. These numbers were identical across invoices being sent in from different\nbrands and senders, which meant these are likely coordinated. The main lures of the emails\nalso revolved around contacting the phone number instead of visiting the site.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Email Body_\nNew waves of the phishing emails are now being sent overnight with new brands ranging\nfrom office supplies, rose delivery and lingerie. After monitoring certain internet\nsources, PDC analysts were able to pull up the referenced sites while they were still live.\nFollowing an involved process of interacting with the site to request a cancellation form, a\nmalicious Excel document was finally retrieved. This infection was the first stage of\nthe BazarBackdoor malware.\n\nThe invoice ruse bypassed various customer SEGs because the email had\nno malicious payload and could be seen as a simple phishing scam. Only a handful of\nrecipients would think to browse to the invoice site and search for a way to cancel their order\nwithout calling the number provided.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Invoice Attachment_\n\nWhile the invoices use a basic template, they look just professional enough that\nan inquisitive recipient might check the site to see if it’s legitimate. Invoices for the older\ncampaigns would be named after the order number, but recent campaigns are utilizing a\n“invoice_*.pdf” format, where the star (*) wildcard is the order number.\n\nInterested in high-fidelity phishing alerts and threat intelligence?

There are several variations of the site, for instance\nusing hyphens to break up the words or using only the first and third words of the fictitious\nbrand. Examples of this would be compact-ssd[.]us and compactstorage[.]us.\n\n_Figure 4: Download Page_\n\nOnce the site is loaded, a series of images walks the user through downloading a form to\ncancel their order. There is a link to the request form, and a link to an email where the form is\nto be sent. This furthers the ruse’s legitimacy. The downloaded form is\nan Excel document that appears to be encrypted by DocuSign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Excel Template_\n\nThis Excel template is themed similarly to a Trickbot template reported on Twitter\n[by @ffforward, who has been tracking the campaign closely. This connection makes sense](https://twitter.com/ffforward/status/1353695027621457921?s=20)\nconsidering the agreement in many quarters that there is a connection between Trickbot\noperators and the group behind BazarBackdoor.\n\nWhen the form is activated, an .EXE payload is immediately launched. This executable is\nalso a new variant of BazarBackdoor. It will reload itself into memory several times before\nthe command-and-controls (C2s) can finally be extracted. Next, the executable queries the\ngeographical location and IP address of the infected machine. This is a common tactic that\nusually ensures that the threat actor does not infect machines in their country of operation.\n\n_Figure 6: Bazar in Memory Strings_\n\nAfter the .EXE finishes loading, we see BazarBackdoor domains in the memory strings.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: C2s for Bazarbackdoor_\n\nWe also can find this campaign’s C2 for dropping the next stage by searching for IP\naddresses in the strings. There is often a common word in the C2s, such as “cleaner” or\n“book” or “snow” that differentiates between campaigns. In the observed campaign for\nthis article, that word is “round_table”.\n\n_Figure 8: DNS traffic_\n\nAn analysis of the machine’s network traffic reveals that DNS requests are being sent\nby BazarBackdoor. This is a common technique the malware employs to mask the servers\nbehind the “bazar” domains. The TCP connections to the three “round_table” servers will\ndrop a data file that is likely part of the next stage.\n\nRecent invoice templates have shifted from using the “.shop” domain to “.net” domains. This\ncampaign was also referred to as “BazarCall” by @ffforward. It is widely believed that this\ncampaign, like prior BazarBackdoor campaigns, will distribute Ryuk ransomware across the\nnetwork. An analysis by The [DFIR](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/01/31/bazar-no-ryuk/) Report found Cobalt strike beacons in their\nenvironment, and PowerShell scripts that are seen in conjunction with Ryuk. However, no\nRyuk was deployed during the analysis.\n\nThe Cofense PDC is still looking into the connection between Kontakt Kegtap and the\nBazarloader/Bazarbackdoor campaigns being delivered from Google Docs and\nGetResponse.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Domain** **IP**\n\n\nhxxp://flowersny[.]net/\n\nhxxp://flowersny[.]us/\n\nhxxp://ttoffice[.]net/\n\nhxxp://ttoffice[.]us\n\nhxxp://toptipsoffice[.]us\n\nhxxp://ajourlingerie[.]net\n\nhxxp://ajourlingerie[.]us/\n\n\n104[.]21[.]7[.]245\n\n104[.]21[.]23[.]158\n\n104[.]21[.]84[.]40\n\n162[.]255[.]119[.]138\n\n194[.]147[.]115[.]9\n\n104[.]21[.]8[.]207\n\n104[.]21[.]4[.]188\n\n\nCommand and Control URLs IP\n\n\nhxxps://18[.]188[.]232[.]155:443/leading/crisis26/snow11\n\nhxxps://18[.]191[.]220[.]165/leading/crisis26/snow11\n\nhxxps://54[.]190[.]50[.]234/organization/round_table\n\n\n18[.]188[.]232[.]155\n\n18[.]191[.]220[.]165\n\n4[.]190[.]50[.]234\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://54[.]215[.]217[.]171/\n\n\n54[.]215[.]217[.]171\n\n\nhxxps://34[.]209[.]41[.]233/foreground/suspect/context59 34[.]209[.]41[.]233\n\n\nhxxps://34[.]220[.]167[.]220/organization/round_table\n\n\n34[.]220[.]167[.]220\n\n\nhxxps://34[.]221[.]125[.]90/foreground/suspect/context59 34[.]221[.]125[.]90\n\nhxxps://japort[.]com/suret/victory[.]php 50[.]87[.]232[.]245\n\nDNS IOCs IP\n\n51[.]254[.]25[.]115:53 51[.]254[.]25[.]115\n\n193[.]183[.]98[.]66:53 193[.]183[.]98[.]66\n\n91[.]217[.]137[.]37:53 91[.]217[.]137[.]37\n\n87[.]98[.]175[.]85:53 87[.]98[.]175[.]85\n\n185[.]121[.]177[.]177:53 185[.]121[.]177[.]177\n\n169[.]239[.]202[.]202:53 169[.]239[.]202[.]202\n\n198[.]251[.]90[.]143:53 198[.]251[.]90[.]143\n\n5[.]132[.]191[.]104:53 5[.]132[.]191[.]104\n\n111[.]67[.]20[.]8:53 111[.]67[.]20[.]8\n\n163[.]53[.]248[.]170:53 163[.]53[.]248[.]170\n\n142[.]4[.]204[.]111:53 142[.]4[.]204[.]111\n\n142[.]4[.]205[.]47:53 142[.]4[.]205[.]47\n\n158[.]69[.]239[.]167:53 158[.]69[.]239[.]167\n\n104[.]37[.]195[.]178:53 104[.]37[.]195[.]178\n\n192[.]99[.]85[.]244:53 192[.]99[.]85[.]244\n\n158[.]69[.]160[.]164:53 158[.]69[.]160[.]164\n\n46[.]28[.]207[.]199:53 46[.]28[.]207[.]199\n\n\n-----\n\n31[.]171[.]251[.]118:53 31[.]171[.]251[.]118\n\n81[.]2[.]241[.]148:53 81[.]2[.]241[.]148\n\n82[.]141[.]39[.]32:53 82[.]141[.]39[.]32\n\n50[.]3[.]82[.]215:53 50[.]3[.]82[.]215\n\n46[.]101[.]70[.]183:53 46[.]101[.]70[.]183\n\n5[.]45[.]97[.]127:53 5[.]45[.]97[.]127\n\n130[.]255[.]78[.]223:53 130[.]255[.]78[.]223\n\n144[.]76[.]133[.]38:53 144[.]76[.]133[.]38\n\n139[.]59[.]208[.]246:53 139[.]59[.]208[.]246\n\n172[.]104[.]136[.]243:53 172[.]104[.]136[.]243\n\n45[.]71[.]112[.]70:53 45[.]71[.]112[.]70\n\n163[.]172[.]185[.]51:53 163[.]172[.]185[.]51\n\n5[.]135[.]183[.]146:53 5[.]135[.]183[.]146\n\n51[.]255[.]48[.]78:53 51[.]255[.]48[.]78\n\n188[.]165[.]200[.]156:53 188[.]165[.]200[.]156\n\n147[.]135[.]185[.]78:53 147[.]135[.]185[.]78\n\n92[.]222[.]97[.]145:53 92[.]222[.]97[.]145\n\n51[.]255[.]211[.]146:53 51[.]255[.]211[.]146\n\n159[.]89[.]249[.]249:53 159[.]89[.]249[.]249\n\n104[.]238[.]186[.]189:53 104[.]238[.]186[.]189\n\n139[.]59[.]23[.]241:53 139[.]59[.]23[.]241\n\n94[.]177[.]171[.]127:53 94[.]177[.]171[.]127\n\n45[.]63[.]124[.]65:53 45[.]63[.]124[.]65\n\n212[.]24[.]98[.]54:53 212[.]24[.]98[.]54\n\n178[.]17[.]170[.]179:53 178[.]17[.]170[.]179\n\n185[.]208[.]208[.]141:53 185[.]208[.]208[.]141\n\n\n-----\n\n82[.]196[.]9[.]45:53 82[.]196[.]9[.]45\n\n146[.]185[.]176[.]36:53 146[.]185[.]176[.]36\n\n89[.]35[.]39[.]64:53 89[.]35[.]39[.]64\n\n89[.]18[.]27[.]167:53 89[.]18[.]27[.]167\n\n77[.]73[.]68[.]161:53 77[.]73[.]68[.]161\n\n185[.]117[.]154[.]144:53 185[.]117[.]154[.]144\n\n176[.]126[.]70[.]119:53 176[.]126[.]70[.]119\n\n139[.]99[.]96[.]146:53 139[.]99[.]96[.]146\n\n217[.]12[.]210[.]54:53 217[.]12[.]210[.]54\n\n185[.]164[.]136[.]225:53 185[.]164[.]136[.]225\n\n192[.]52[.]166[.]110:53 192[.]52[.]166[.]110\n\n63[.]231[.]92[.]27:53 63[.]231[.]92[.]27\n\n66[.]70[.]211[.]246:53 66[.]70[.]211[.]246\n\n96[.]47[.]228[.]108:53 96[.]47[.]228[.]108\n\n45[.]32[.]160[.]206:53 45[.]32[.]160[.]206\n\n128[.]52[.]130[.]209:53 128[.]52[.]130[.]209\n\n35[.]196[.]105[.]24:53 35[.]196[.]105[.]24\n\n172[.]98[.]193[.]42:53 172[.]98[.]193[.]42\n\n162[.]248[.]241[.]94:53 162[.]248[.]241[.]94\n\n107[.]172[.]42[.]186:53 107[.]172[.]42[.]186\n\n167[.]99[.]153[.]82:53 167[.]99[.]153[.]82\n\n138[.]197[.]25[.]214:53 138[.]197[.]25[.]214\n\n69[.]164[.]196[.]21:53 69[.]164[.]196[.]21\n\n192[.]71[.]245[.]208:53 192[.]71[.]245[.]208\n\n185[.]120[.]22[.]15:53 185[.]120[.]22[.]15\n\n45[.]71[.]185[.]100:53 45[.]71[.]185[.]100\n\n\n-----\n\n**_All third-party trademarks referenced by Cofense whether in logo form, name form or product_**\n**_form, or otherwise, remain the property of their respective holders, and use of these trademarks in_**\n**_no way indicates any relationship between Cofense and the holders of the trademarks.
