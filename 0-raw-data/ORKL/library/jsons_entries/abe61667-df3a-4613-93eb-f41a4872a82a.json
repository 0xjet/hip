Data extortion is not a new tactic for criminal adversaries; however,\nwhen BGH operations don’t result in payment, victims now face a double-headed threat of\nensuring their data does not make it into the hands of others.\n\nThis first part of a two-part blog series explores the origins of ransomware, BGH and\nextortion, and introduces some of the criminal adversaries that are currently dominating this\ndata leak extortion ecosystem.\n\n## A Brief History of Ransomware and Big Game Hunting\n\nThe [origins of ransomware can in part be traced back to around 2008 with the development](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/what-is-ransomware/history-of-ransomware/)\nof fake antivirus software by cybercriminal organizations. These applications showed phony\nalerts to victims and required payment to “clean up” malware infections. These criminal\nenterprises were driven by affiliates (known in Russian-speaking criminal forums as\n_partnerka) that earned a commission for each infection and each fake antivirus purchase. At_\n\n\n-----\n\nthe time, these criminal organizations were able to leverage high-risk merchant accounts to\naccept credit cards, making it easy for the average victim to pay for their bogus software.\nEventually, credit card companies were able to identify and prevent these types of fraudulent\ntransactions, effectively putting the eCriminals out of business.\n\nAs fake antivirus software disappeared, a new threat emerged that became the predecessor\nto modern ransomware. Known as a screen locker, this threat would typically display a\nmessage impersonating international law enforcement agencies such as the FBI, Interpol\nand the U.K.’s Metropolitan Police Service. The message essentially locked a victim out of\naccessing their desktop, demanding payment as a “fine” for the victim’s “criminal” activity,\nsuch as viewing illicit pornography, distributing copyrighted material, etc. Payment was made\nprimarily through Ukash, Paysafe and MoneyPak. There were also screen lockers that\nclaimed to encrypt a victim’s files; however, the vast majority did not perform any encryption.\nThe criminals behind this activity used the same affiliate-driven model as the fake antivirus\ngroups to share profits.\n\nScreen lockers virtually disappeared after the introduction of a ransomware family known as\n_CryptoLocker in 2013. CryptoLocker ransomware was revolutionary in both the number of_\nsystems it impacted and its use of strong cryptographic algorithms. The ransomware was\ndeveloped by the so-called BusinessClub that used the massive Gameover Zeus botnet with\nover a million infections. The group primarily leveraged their botnet for banking-related fraud.\nHowever, they realized that not all infections could be monetized easily, so they decided to\ndevelop their own ransomware and deploy it to a subset of their botnet’s infected systems.\nThe ransom demand for victims was relatively small — an amount between $100 and $300\nUSD — and payable in a variety of digital currencies including cashU, Ukash, Paysafe,\nMoneyPak, and Bitcoin (BTC). CryptoLocker became extremely successful, and other\ncybercriminals took notice, leading to an explosion in ransomware malware families that\ncontinued to use the same affiliate-based profit-sharing model.\n\nThe next major trend in ransomware began in 2016 with the introduction of the Samas\nransomware by BOSS SPIDER. Unlike prior ransomware families, Samas went specifically\nafter businesses rather than individuals. This group initially gained access to corporate\nnetworks using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and outdated JBoss instances that were\nexposed to the internet. Once inside the organization, BOSS SPIDER used tactics similar to\n[many state-sponsored threat actors to move laterally, compromise an organization’s domain](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/lateral-movement/)\ncontroller, and thereafter deploy their ransomware. Not only did Samas impact businesses,\nbut BOSS SPIDER realized that they could demand a significantly large ransom payment.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence refers to this operational model as ® _[big game hunting, which was](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/)_\nquickly adopted by INDRIK SPIDER.\n\nInterestingly, INDRIK SPIDER had primarily focused on banking fraud for more than half a\ndecade. However, after BOSS SPIDER’s success with BGH attacks, INDRIK SPIDER\nrealized that ransomware was far more profitable and far less complex to monetize (e.g., it\ndid not require an extensive money mule network to launder funds) This actor shifted from\n\n\n-----\n\nbanking fraud to ransomware in 2017, developing BitPaymer ransomware, and more\nrecently, WastedLocker. Since the early BGH operations of BOSS SPIDER and INDRIK\nSPIDER, the trend has transformed the eCrime ecosystem. New adversaries have adopted\nBGH techniques, and enablers have built tools to cater to this burgeoning market.\n\n## A New Trend: Cyber Extortion\n\nCyber extortion also has a long history, including email extortion, distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) extortion and data extortion attacks. Email extortion is likely the most prolific and\nlongest-standing form of cyber extortion given its low barrier to entry. In order to operate\ncampaigns, criminal actors merely need to acquire leaked passwords, which can be easily\nfound on Pastebin, or other more superficial victim information, such as a telephone number,\nto help appear legitimate in that they have somehow acquired damaging information related\nto the victim. These actors typically send an email to the victim with one piece of legitimate\npersonal information, claim the victim was infected with malware and thus acquire more\ndamaging information. The actor then demands a ransom payment in order to keep the\ninformation from being sent to the victim’s friends, family or colleagues.\n\nA slightly more sophisticated version of this technique came with the emergence of DDoS\nextortion. As early as April 2014, PIZZO SPIDER (also known as DD4BC, which is an\nacronym for “DDoS for Bitcoin”) sent emails claiming that they would DDoS a business and\ntake down their services if the business did not pay the demanded ransom amount, as\nshown in Figure 1. Later, MIMIC SPIDER and other criminal actors operating Internet of\nThings (IoT) [botnets, such as Mirai, used this technique. Some of these actors conducted](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/botnets/)\nDDoS attacks before the threat to prove they could follow through, while other actors simply\nrode the coattails of other attacks, sending the threat while unable to follow through with the\ndeed.\n\nFigure 1. PIZZO SPIDER threatening to DDoS a gambling site unless ransom is paid (click image to\n\nenlarge)\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the more publicized actors to capitalize on this trend and take it to the next level is\nOVERLORD SPIDER, aka The Dark Overlord. Similar to ransomware operators today,\nOVERLORD SPIDER likely purchased RDP access to compromised servers on underground\nforums in order to exfiltrate data from corporate networks. The actor was known to attempt to\n“sell back” the data to the respective victims, threatening to sell the data to interested parties\nshould the victim refuse to pay. There was at least one identified instance of OVERLORD\nSPIDER successfully selling victim data on an underground market.\n\n## Putting It All Together: Cyber Extortion With Ransomware\n\nOn May 7, 2019, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young confirmed that the network for the U.S. City of\nBaltimore (CoB) was infected with ransomware, which was announced via Twitter . This1\ninfection was later confirmed to be conducted by OUTLAW SPIDER, which is the actor\nbehind the RobbinHood ransomware. The actor demanded to be paid 3 BTC (approximately\n$17,600 USD at the time) per infected system, or 13 BTC (approximately $76,500 USD at\nthe time) for all infected systems to recover the city’s files.\n\n\nOn May 9, 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed OUTLAW SPIDER post an image on the\nTor hidden service hosted by the actors to establish communications with their victims\n(known as a payment portal). This image contained sensitive information allegedly taken\nfrom the CoB network and was posted along with a message stating, “The city also said no\npersonal data has been compromised, Really ?!.” This comment was likely in response to\npublic statements by the city that no personal information had been compromised during the\nincident and to incentivize ransom payment. Young later stated that not only was the city not\ngoing to pay the ransom, but that “we’re going to get [the threat actors] and punish them to\n_the fullest extent of the law.” This was followed by further communications from OUTLAW2_\nSPIDER, through an established Twitter account and the payment portal, stating they would\nremove all collected city information if the ransom was paid by a specified deadline, as\nshown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 OUTLAW SPIDER’s City of Baltimore payment portal communications (click image to enlarge)\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough ineffective, the incident with the CoB and OUTLAW SPIDER was the first instance\nobserved by CrowdStrike Intelligence of data extortion to incentivize ransom payment.\n\n## Ransomware Actors Leaking Victim Data\n\nAfter the CoB incident with OUTLAW SPIDER, several months passed before TWISTED\nSPIDER reintroduced this technique in November 2019. TWISTED SPIDER’s late 2019\n[activity proved the catalyst for numerous eCrime threat actors adopting the use of dedicated](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)\nleak sites (DLSs) to threaten the distribution of company data in various forms. TWISTED\nSPIDER remains the most prolific actor using this technique, with a variety of actors adopting\nthis technique through the first half of 2020, as shown in Figure 3. This section provides an\noverview of each of these threat actors and how they incentivize and pressure victims to pay\nransoms.\n\nFigure 3. Number of entities published to dedicated leak sites by criminal adversaries from November\n\n2019 through July 2020 (click image to enlarge)\n\n\n-----\n\n### TWISTED SPIDER\n\n[TWISTED SPIDER has been operating Maze ransomware since at least May 2019;](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/maze-ransomware-deobfuscation/)\nhowever, the actors did not start leaking victim data until November 2019. They first\nadvertised their data leaks on a Russian underground forum, claiming to include 10% of the\nvictim’s data and threatening to leak the remaining data in a later post. In these posts, the\ncriminal actor called out popular security companies and warned another victim to pay the\nransom quickly. On December 10, 2019, they created a DLS but continued to post to\nRussian underground forums.\n\nOn January 2, 2020, a victim filed a lawsuit against TWISTED SPIDER and the company\nhosting the DLS containing the stolen files. This caused the site to be temporarily taken\ndown, but TWISTED SPIDER merely created a new DLS on January 9, 2020. Despite the\nlegal action, the actor remained active, continuing to deploy their ransomware on victim\nnetworks and posting data either on underground forums or to the new DLS. Currently, the\ncriminal actor hosts the DLS simultaneously on the web and on a Tor hidden service.\nTWISTED SPIDER’s audacious commentary continues to persist as they mock security\ncompanies and researchers in posts on their DLS, and call out victims before and after the\nrelease of data to induce payment.\n\nWhen TWISTED SPIDER leaks victim data, the actor publishes identifying information,\nincluding the victim’s headquarters, phone number, fax number and website, as shown in\nFigure 4. If the post is intended to serve as a warning, the actors will only upload a sample of\ndata for proof. In addition to leaking data on their DLS, TWISTED SPIDER also uses the site\nas a platform for their press releases. These releases include terms and conditions for their\noperations, naming and shaming victims, and proclamations of the group’s alleged\nmotivations and goals.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Screenshot of Maze DLS (click image to enlarge)\n\nWhile TWISTED SPIDER may not have been the first ransomware actor to conduct data\nextortion, they have been successful in operationalizing the practice. The actor has\ncontinued to leak data with increased frequency and consistency. The timeline in Figure 5\nprovides a view of data leaks from over 230 victims from November 11, 2019, until May\n2020. The lighter color indicates just one victim targeted or published to the site, while the\ndarkest red indicates more than six victims affected. TWISTED SPIDER has had multiple\ninstances where they have published over 10 victims in one day. In addition, the group\nappears to work most days of the week, with Sunday being the least prolific day and\nMondays and Fridays being the most active.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Timeline of victims published to TWISTED SPIDER s news site by publish date, or actor-claimed\n\nlock date when available, through July 2020 (click image to enlarge)\n\n### PINCHY SPIDER\n\nOn December 9, 2019 (approximately two and a half weeks after TWISTED SPIDER’s first\n[leak), a vendor of PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil ransomware as a service (RaaS) posted a threat](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/what-is-ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/)\nto leak victim data to an underground forum. This is the first time CrowdStrike Intelligence\nobserved the group or their affiliates making such a threat, and it appeared to be in\nfrustration over failing to monetize compromises at a U.S.-based managed service provider\n(MSP) and a China-based asset management firm. Since that time, affiliates of PINCHY\nSPIDER have posted data on more than 80 victims.\n\nPINCHY SPIDER began leaking victim data on underground forums before launching a DLS\non February 26, 2020, hosted using a Tor hidden service. Similar to TWISTED SPIDER’s\ninitial leaks, PINCHY SPIDER warns victims of the planned data leak, usually via a blog post\non their DLS containing sample data as proof (see Figure 6), before releasing the bulk of the\ndata after a given amount of time. REvil will also provide a link to the blog post within the\nransom note distributed to systems encrypted by REvil ransomware. The link contains a GET\nparameter, which if provided with a given link, will display the leak to the affected victim prior\nto being exposed to the public. Upon visiting the link, a countdown timer will begin, which will\ncause the leak to be published once the given amount of time has elapsed.\n\nFigure 6. Screenshot of REvil’s DLS (click image to enlarge)\n\n\n-----\n\nA timeline for victims affected by PINCHY SPIDER’s data leaks is shown in Figure 7. A\nsingle victim published is displayed as the lightest color; the darkest color indicates six\nvictims were published to the site in one day. While PINCHY SPIDER affiliates took time to\nbegin using the tactic, by the time April 2020 rolled around, the publishing of victim data\nbecame more consistent. In addition, unlike TWISTED SPIDER, affiliates of PINCHY\nSPIDER appear to take weekends off; victim data is typically published during the working\ndays of Monday through Friday.\n\nFigure 7. Timeline of victims affected by data leaks conducted by affiliates of PINCHY SPIDER from\n\nJanuary through July 2020 (click image to enlarge)\n\n### DOPPEL SPIDER\n\n[DOPPEL SPIDER, operator and developer of the ransomware DoppelPaymer, was next to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/doppelpaymer-ransomware-and-dridex-2/)\nleak victim data.\n\nSince introducing their DLS (see Figure 8) on February 21, 2020, the actor has published\ndata from over 40 victims. However, while TWISTED SPIDER and PINCHY SPIDER typically\nleak data in at most three parts, DOPPEL SPIDER will leak data over multiple days, and\nsometimes weeks. Additionally, DOPPEL SPIDER will only post victim information after a\nvictim refuses to pay and the timer for the payment deadline has expired. The actor is likely\nallowing the victim to observe that the data is legitimate and incentivize them to pay the\nransom before all of their data is leaked.\n\nFigure 8. Screenshot of main page of DoppelPaymer DLS (click image to enlarge)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 9, DOPPEL SPIDER is not as visibly prolific as TWISTED SPIDER\nor PINCHY SPIDER and leaks data sporadically, occasionally going one to two weeks\nwithout victims being published. The timeline below displays a single victim published to the\nsite as the lightest color with up to three victims, the darkest color, having been published in\na given day.\n\nFigure 9. Timeline of data leaks conducted by DOPPEL SPIDER, February through July 2020 (click image\n\nto enlarge)\n\n### VIKING SPIDER\n\nVIKING SPIDER is the criminal group behind the development and distribution of Ragnar\n_Locker ransomware. While public reporting indicates the group began threatening to leak_\nvictim data in February 2020, a DLS was not observed until April 2020. The DLS is hosted on\nTor, and similar to other actors, proof of data exfiltration is provided before the stolen data is\nfully leaked. Since this time, at least 12 victims have been observed on their DLS, which is\nshown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10. Screenshot of Ragnar Locker DLS (click image to enlarge)\n\n### LockBit\n\n\n-----\n\nIn development since at least September 2019, LockBit is available as a RaaS, advertised to\nRussian-speaking users or English speakers with a Russian-speaking guarantor. In May\n2020, an affiliate operating LockBit posted a threat to leak data on a popular Russianlanguage criminal forum, as shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Example content of forum post threatening data leak by affiliate operating LockBit (click image\n\nto enlarge)\n\nIn addition to the threat, the affiliate provides proof, such as an image of the folder structure\nand at least one screenshot of an example document contained within the victim data. Once\nthe deadline passes, the affiliate is known to post a mega[.]nz link to download the stolen\nvictim data. This affiliate has threatened to publish data from at least nine victims. Currently,\nthere is no DLS in operation dedicated to LockBit ransomware.\n\n### MedusaLocker\n\n_MedusaLocker is a ransomware family that was first seen in the wild in early October 2019._\nIn January 2020, a fork of MedusaLocker named Ako was observed, which has been\nupdated to support the use of a Tor hidden service to facilitate a RaaS model. Operators of\nthe Ako version of the malware have since implemented a DLS (Figure 12). At least nine\nvictims have been published to the site since its inception.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Screenshot of MedusaLocker fork Ako DLS (click image to enlarge)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nData extortion is not a new trend, but it seems to be growing in popularity to fuel ransomware\noperations. OVERLORD SPIDER is one of possibly many eCrime actors using data theft and\nextortion as the main driver for their operations — in fact, it is the only method used by this\nactor. OVERLORD SPIDER’s operations have been well publicized and may have influenced\nother actors about the potential effectiveness of this tactic in eliciting payment.\n\nTo date, the majority of ransomware operators engaged in BGH operations have adopted or\nthreatened the data-theft-and-leak tactic, with the exception of INDRIK SPIDER and\nWIZARD SPIDER. It is also likely that less sophisticated ransomware operators will threaten\ndata leaks, even if they do not have the capability to exfiltrate data, in order to capitalize on\nthe current trend of data extortion by bluffing.\n\nAs organizations improve their capabilities to rebound from ransomware attacks and security\nresearchers continue to create decryptors for ransomware, there is less incentive for victims\nto pay the ransom in order to reclaim files. However, criminal actors have found a way to\nthwart these defensive measures. By exfiltrating data from victim networks and leaking it if\ncompanies refuse to comply, criminal actors might be able revitalize the financial returns of\ntheir criminal activities.\n\n**_This blog was written by CrowdStrike Intelligence analysts Molly Lane, Josh_**\n**_Reynolds, Brett Stone-Gross and Bex Hartley._**\n\n1 https://twitter[.]com/mayorbcyoung/status/11258266762801889292 https://www.baltimore[.]com/politics/bs-md-young-hack-20190510-story.html\n\n\n-----\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Download: CrowdStrike 2020 Global Threat Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/2020-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/)_\n_To learn more about how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security_\n_strategy, visit the_ _[Falcon X Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n_Learn more about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon p®_ _latform by visiting_\n_the product webpage._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and learn how true next-](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
