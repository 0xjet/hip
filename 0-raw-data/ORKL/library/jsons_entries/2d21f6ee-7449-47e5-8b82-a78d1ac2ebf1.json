Although physical controls can be part of a multifaceted defense, an electronic\nattack affords the adversary time to develop the necessary tools to bypass any logical wall\nset before them. In the latest findings from the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team, we\nexamine an adversary that was not content with a single campaign, but launched five distinct\nwaves adapted to their separate targets. The new report “Operation Oceansalt Attacks South\nKorea, U.S., and Canada with Source Code from Chinese Hacker Group” analyzes these\nwaves and their victims, primarily in South Korea but with a few in the United States and\nCanada.\n\nAlthough one reaction is to marvel at the level of innovation displayed by the threat actor(s),\nwe are not discussing five new, never-before-seen malware variants—rather the reuse of\ncode from implants seen eight years prior. The Oceansalt malware uses large parts of code\nfrom the Seasalt implant, which was linked to the Chinese hacking group Comment Crew.\nThe level of reuse is graphically depicted below:\n\n## Code Visualization of Recent Oceansalt with Older Seasalt\n\n\n-----\n\n_Oceansalt, 2018._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Seasalt, 2010._\n\n## Who is Behind the Oceansalt Attack?\n\nOriginally taking the title APT1, the Comment Crew was seen as the threat actor conducting\noffensive cyber operations against the United States almost 10 years before. The obvious\nsuspect is Comment Crew and, although this may seem a logical conclusion, we have not\nseen any activity from this group since they were initially exposed. Is it possible that this\ngroup has returned and, if so, why target South Korea?\n\nIt is possible that the source code developed by Comment Crew has now been used by\nanother adversary. The code to our knowledge, however, has never been made public.\nAlternatively, this could be a “false flag” operation to suggest that we are seeing the reemergence of Comment Crew. Creating false flags is a common practice.\n\n## What Really Matters\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is likely that reactions to this research will focus on debating the identity of the threat actor.\nAlthough this question is of great interest, answering it will require more than the technical\nevidence that private industry can provide. These limitations are frustrating. However, we can\nfocus on the indicators of compromise presented in this report to detect, correct, and protect\nour systems, regardless of the source of these attacks.\n\nPerhaps more important is the possible return of a previously dormant threat actor and,\nfurther, why should this campaign occur now? Regardless of whether this is a false flag\noperation to suggest the rebirth of Comment Crew, the impact of the attack is unknown.\nHowever, one thing is certain. Threat actors have a wealth of code available to leverage new\n[campaigns, as previous research from the Advanced Threat Research team has revealed. In](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/examining-code-reuse-reveals-undiscovered-links-among-north-koreas-malware-families/)\nthis case we see that collaboration not within a group but potentially with another threat actor\n—offering up considerably more malicious assets. We often talk about partnerships within\nthe private and public sector as the key to tackling the cybersecurity challenges facing\nsociety. The bad actors are not putting these initiatives on PowerPoint slides and marketing\nmaterial; they are demonstrating that partnerships can suit their ends, too.\n\n[Raj Samani VP, Chief Technical Officer EMEA](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/raj-samani/)\nRaj Samani is Chief Scientist and Fellow for the Enterprise business.
