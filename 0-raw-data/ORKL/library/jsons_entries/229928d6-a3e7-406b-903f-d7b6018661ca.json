As a result, AvosLocker\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) vary between indicators specific to AvosLocker malware\nand indicators specific to the individual affiliate responsible for the intrusion.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nAvosLocker ransomware encrypts files on a victim’s server and renames them with the\n“.avos” extension. AvosLocker actors then place ransom notes on the victim server and\ninclude a link to an AvosLocker .onion payment site (Figure 1). Depending upon the affiliate,\npayments in Monero are preferred; however, they accept Bitcoin for a 10-25% premium. We\nhave also observed alleged AvosLocker representatives make phone calls to the victims to\ndirect them to the payment site to negotiate. Multiple victims have also reported that\nAvosLocker negotiators have been willing to negotiate reduced ransom payments.\n\nThe AvosLocker leak site claims to have targeted victims in the United States, Syria, Saudi\nArabia, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom,\nCanada, China, and Taiwan. The leak site includes samples of stolen victim data and\nthreatens to sell the data to unspecified third parties, if a victim does not pay the ransom.\n\nAvosLocker ransomware is a multi-threaded Windows executable written in C++ that runs as\na console application and shows a log of actions performed on victim systems.

Prior to encryption, the ransomware maps accessible drives and\nenumerated files in directories. It then encrypts files while creating a ransom note named\n\"GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt\" in every directory.\n\nIn observed cases, encrypted files have the file extension “.avos”, “.avos2”, or “AvosLinux”.\nInfected directories have a text file entitled “GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt”. In some cases,\nthe text from the text file reproduces on the desktop wallpaper of infected servers. The\n“GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt” file directs victims to an onion site accessible via a TOR\nbrowser, where the victim is prompted to enter an ID provided to them in the ransom note.\n\nAvosLocker\n\nAttention!\n\nYour systems have been encrypted, and your confidential documents were downloaded.\n\nIn order to restore your data, you must pay for the decryption key & application.\n\nYou may do so by visiting us at\nhttp://avosjon4pfh3y7ew3jdwz6ofw7lljcxlbk7hcxxmnxlh5kvf2akcqjad.onion.\n\nThis is an onion address that you may access using Tor Browser which you may download at\nhttps://www.torproject.org/download/\n\nDetails such as pricing, how long before the price increases and such will be available to you once\nyou enter your ID presented to you below in this note in our website.\n\nContact us soon, because those who don't have their data leaked in our press release blog and\nthe price they'll have to pay will go up significantly.\n\nThe corporations whom don't pay or fail to respond in a swift manner have their data leaked in our\nblog, accessible at http://avosqxh72b5ia23dl5fgwcpndkctuzqvh2iefk5imp3pi5gfhel5klad.onion\n\n**_(U) Figure 1 - AvosLocker Ransom Note circa December 2021_**\n\n**Indicators of compromise specific to the victim’s actions**\n\n_Data published on the leak site_\n\nAvosLocker actors publish victim exfiltrated data on the AvosLocker public leak site if victims\ndo not negotiate or pay the ransom. The AvosLocker public leak site is separate from the site\n\n\n-----\n\n**T TLP: WHITE** FBI | FinCEN |Treasury\n\nAvosLocker directs victims to in the “GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt” file. The public leak site\nlists victims of AvosLocker, along with a sample of data allegedly stolen from the victim’s\nnetwork. The leak site gives visitors an opportunity to view a sample of victim data and to\npurchase victim data.\n\n_Phone calls and DDOS attacks_\n\nIn some cases, AvosLocker victims receive phone calls from an AvosLocker representative.\nThe caller encourages the victim to go to the onion site to negotiate and threatens to post\nstolen data online. In some cases, AvosLocker actors will threaten and execute distributed\ndenial-of-service (DDoS) attacks during negotiations.\n\n**Indicators of compromise specific to the affiliate**\n\nPersistence mechanisms on victim systems include the modification of Windows Registry\n'Run' keys and the use of scheduled tasks.\n\n_Other tools associated with AvosLocker ransomware attacks:_\n\n     - Cobalt Strike\n\n     - Encoded PowerShell scripts (publicly available tool)\n\n     - PuTTY Secure Copy client tool “pscp.exe”\n\n     - Rclone\n\n     - AnyDesk\n\n     - Scanner\n\n     - Advanced IP Scanner\n\n     - WinLister\n\n## Vulnerabilities\n\nMultiple victims have reported on premise Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities as the\nlikely intrusion vector.\n\nSome victims pointed to specific vulnerabilities: including the Proxy Shell vulnerabilities\nassociated to CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-34473, in addition to\nCVE-2021-26855.\n\nIntrusion vectors are likely dependent on the skillsets of the AvosLocker affiliate who\ninfiltrated the victim’s network.\n\n## MITIGATIONS\n\n     - Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or\n\nproprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location\n(i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).\n\n\n**T TLP: WHITE** FBI | FinCEN |Treasury\n\n\n-----\n\n**T TLP: WHITE** FBI | FinCEN |Treasury\n\n     - Implement network segmentation and maintain offline backups of data to ensure\n\nlimited interruption to the organization.\n\n     - Regularly back up data, password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of\n\ncritical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the\ndata resides.\n\n     - Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts, and enable real time\n\ndetection.\n\n     - Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as\n\nupdates/patches are released.\n\n     - Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or\n\nunrecognized user accounts.\n\n     - Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with\n\nleast privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.\n\n     - Disable unused ports.\n\n     - Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\n\n     - Disable hyperlinks in received emails.\n\n     - Use multifactor authentication where possible.\n\n     - Use strong passwords and regularly change passwords to network systems and\n\naccounts, implementing the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes.\nAvoid reusing passwords for multiple accounts.\n\n     - Require administrator credentials to install software.\n\n     - Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing\n\nand using a VPN.\n\n     - Focus on cyber security awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training\n\non information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging\ncybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities (i.e., ransomware and phishing scams).\n\n## RESOURCES\n\nFor additional resources related to the prevention and mitigation of ransomware, go to\nh ttps://www.stopransomware.gov as well as the C ISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and\nA nalysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Stopransomware.gov is the\nGovernment’s official one-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively.\n\nFinancial Institutions must also ensure compliance with any applicable Bank Secrecy Act\nrequirements, including suspicious activity reporting obligations. Indicators of compromise,\nsuch as suspicious email addresses, file names, hashes, domains, and IP addresses can be\nprovided under Item 44 of the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) form. For more information\non mandatory and voluntary reporting of cyber events via suspicious activity reports (SARs),\nsee FinCEN Advisory FIN-2016-A005, “Advisory to Financial Institutions on Cyber-Events\nand Cyber-Enabled Crime,” October 25, 2016, and FinCEN Advisory FIN-2021-A004,\n“Advisory on Ransomware and the Use of the Financial System to Facilitate Ransom\nPayments,” November 8, 2021, which updates FinCEN Advisory FIN-2020-A006.\n\n\n**T TLP: WHITE** FBI | FinCEN |Treasury\n\n\n-----\n\n**T TLP: WHITE** FBI | FinCEN |Treasury\n\nCISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered\nset of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and\nrecover from a ransomware incident.\n\nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure\norganizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.\nBy requesting these services, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk\nand mitigate attack vectors.\n\n\n**T TLP: WHITE** FBI | FinCEN |Treasury\n\n\n-----",
