Although it's clearly based on the same code and\nshares most of its features with its predecessors, the campaign that it's been part of differs\nsignificantly from campaigns involving the previous versions of this malware.\n\nVega samples were first discovered in the beginning of 2019, being distributed alongside other\nwidespread financial malware as part of a malvertising operation on Yandex.Direct - a Russian\n[online advertising network. This campaign was aimed at Russian speaking users (with](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/04/30/buhtrap-backdoor-ransomware-advertising-platform/)\napparent focus on the people working in accounting) and was designed to have a broad reach,\nas opposed to careful targeting. The binaries were often signed with a valid certificate and\nhosted on GitHub. During a course of this year, several new versions of Vega appeared, each\nbearing a different name (Jamper, Storm, Buran, etc.), some of them offered as a service on\nunderground forums.\n\nThe recent campaign that utilizes the newest variant, Zeppelin, is visibly distinct. The first\nsamples of Zeppelin - with compilation timestamps no earlier than November 6, 2019 - were\ndiscovered targeting a handful of carefully chosen tech and healthcare companies in Europe\n\n\n-----\n\nand the U.S. In a stark opposition to the Vega campaign, all Zeppelin binaries (as well as some\nnewer Buran samples) are designed to quit if running on machines that are based in Russia\nand some other ex-USSR countries.\n\nZeppelin appears to be highly configurable and can be deployed as an EXE, DLL, or wrapped\nin a PowerShell loader. The samples are hosted on water-holed websites and, in the case of\nPowerShell, on Pastebin. There are reasons to believe at least some of the attacks were\nconducted through MSSPs, which would bear similarities to another recent highly targeted\ncampaign that used a ransomware called Sodinokibi.\n\nThe major shift in targeting from Russian-speaking to Western countries, as well as differences\nin victim selection and malware deployment methods, suggest that this new variant of Vega\nransomware ended up in the hands of different threat actors - either used by them as a service,\nor redeveloped from bought/stolen/leaked sources.\n\n## Obfuscation\n\nAll sensitive strings in Zeppelin binaries are obfuscated with a different pseudo-random 32-byte\nRC4 key, prepended to each encrypted string:\n\n_Figure 1: Obfuscated string_\n\nThe string obfuscation acts as a crude polymorphism mechanism, as each generated sample\nwill use different RC4 keys. It also helps Zeppelin evade detection and complicates analysis.\n\nAlthough the majority of samples are not packed, BlackBerry Cylance researchers have come\nacross Zeppelin executables protected by attackers using additional polymorphic obfuscation\nsoftware.\n\nIn these cases, the Zeppelin executables were wrapped in three layers of obfuscation:\n\nCode of varying size using a set of random APIs (often associated with benign software)\nand several stalling loops to deceive heuristic mechanisms and outrun sandboxes.\nFirst stage shellcode, encoded with simple XOR using a static 1-byte key derived from a\nhardcoded DWORD value. This shellcode decodes the payload binary, together with its\nloader, using 1-byte XOR, but this time the key is mutated for each decryption round.\nSecond stage shellcode which injects the payload binary into memory and executes it:\n\n_Figure 2: Example of a stalling loop in the first layer of obfuscation_\n\n_Figure 3: Payload decoding shellcode_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe ransomware appears to have the following Boolean options:\n\n**ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n1 _(none)_ Run as DLL: one instance encrypting all drives and shares (as opposed to\nEXE); incompatible with “Startup” option.\n\n2 IP Logger Use IPLogger service (iplogger[.]ru or iplogger[.]org) to track victim’s IP\naddress and country code.\n\n3 Startup Copy itself to another location, set persistence, launch with “-start”\nparameter.\n\n\n4 Delete\nbackups\n\n\nExecute specified commands; used to stop certain services, disable\nrecovery, delete backups and shadow copies, etc.\n\n\n5 Task-killer Kill specified processes.\n\n\n6 Autounlock\nbusy files\n\n\nTry to unlock files that appear locked during encryption.\n\n\n7 Melt Before exiting, inject self-deletion thread to notepad.exe (deletes the\nexecutable, as well as all added registry values). Exit with 0xDEADFACE\ncode.\n\n\n8 UAC\nprompt\n\n\nWhen re-running try elevating privileges (only used when \"Startup\" set).\n\n\nThese options, along with the public RSA key and other configurable strings, can be set from\nthe Zeppelin builder user-interface during generation of the ransomware binary:\n\n_Figure 4: Example configuration_\n\nAll configurable data is stored in the .itext section of the Zeppelin binary and includes:\n\nHardcoded public key (modulus and exponent separately)\nGUID (differs for each sample)\n\n\n-----\n\nURL address for IPLogger check-in\nExcluded folders list\nExcluded files list\nExcluded extensions list\nList of processes to kill\nList of commands to run\nReadme file name\nReadme file content\n\n## Execution\n\nThe ransomware binary can be executed with the following parameters:\n\n**Parameter** **Description**\n\n\n<path to an\nexisting\nfile>\n\n<path to an\nexisting\ndirectory>\n\n\nEncrypt one file\n\nEncrypt files in the specified directory\n\n\n-start Skip installation and execute the second stage of malicious code (i.e. file\nencryption)\n\n-agent <int> Run as an agent; encrypt files in the path specified in a value under\nHKCU/Software/Zeppelin/Paths key, where <int> is the name of the value\n(consecutive numbers starting with 0)\n\n\n_(no_\n_parameters)_\n\n## Installation\n\n\nDefault encryption routine\n\n\nUpon initial execution (without parameters), the malware will check the victim’s country code to\nmake sure it’s not running in one of the following countries:\n\nRussian Federation\nUkraine\nBelorussia\nKazakhstan\n\n\n-----\n\nDepending on the options set during the building process, it will either check the machine s\ndefault language and default country calling code or use an online service to obtain the victim’s\nexternal IP address:\n\n_Figure 5: Checking victim's country_\n\nThe malware creates an empty file in the %TEMP% directory with the “.zeppelin” extension and\na name that is a CRC32 hash of the malware path.\n\nIf the “Startup” option is set the malware will copy itself to the\n**%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows directory using a name randomly chosen from the**\nlist of active processes (ignoring any processes that were invoked with an “install” or “setup”\ncommand-line argument).\n\nThe chosen name is then encrypted with a randomly generated 32-byte RC4 key, base64\nencoded (together with the prepended key) and saved to a registry value called “Process”\nunder HKCU\\Software\\Zeppelin.\n\nAfter setting persistence via the HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run key in\nthe registry, the ransomware will re-execute itself from the new path with the “-start” argument.\nIf the “UAC prompt” option is set, it will try to run with elevated privileges.\n\nIf the “Melt” option is set, a self-deletion thread will be injected into a newly spawned\nnotepad.exe process and the malware will exit with the code 0xDEADFACE. Otherwise, it will\nsimply exit with code 0.\n\n## Network Communication\n\nLike its predecessors, Zeppelin allows attackers to track the IP addresses and location of\nvictims via the IPLogger web service. If the relevant option is set, the ransomware will try to\ncheck-in by sending a GET request to a hardcoded URL that was generated by using the\nIPLogger URL Shortener service. The User-Agent field id set to “ZEPPELIN” and the referrer\nfield contains a unique victim ID, created during the key generation phase:\n\n_Figure 6: GET request with custom headers_\n\nTo prevent a victim from checking in more than once, a “Knock” value of 0x29A (666) is written\nunder HKCU\\Software\\Zeppelin. If the value already exists, the malware will not try to contact\nthe URL on subsequent runs.\n\nAttackers can use the IPLogger web service to view a list of victims and use the shortened\nURL to redirect users to other malicious content.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key Generation\n\nThe encryption algorithm has not changed substantially compared to previous versions of\nBuran. It employs a standard combination of symmetric file encryption with randomly generated\nkeys for each file (AES-256 in CBC mode), and asymmetric encryption used to protect the\nsession key (using a custom RSA implementation, possibly developed in-house).\n\nFirst, the malware will generate a pair of 512-bit RSA keys for the victim and save them to\nmemory in the following format:\n\n<N>{privatekey_modulus_hexstr}</N><D>{privatekey_exponent_hexstr}</D>\n<N>{publickey_modulus_hexstr}</N><E>{publickey_exponent_hexstr}</E>\n\n_Figure 7: Example of encryption keys: attacker’s public key (blue), generated victim's public_\n_key (green) & private key (red), their encrypted and base64 encode versions (yellow)_\n\nThe private key from this pair will be encrypted using the attacker’s 2048-bit public RSA key\nhardcoded in the .itext section of the binary. Both the victim’s RSA encrypted private key and its\ncorresponding public key will then be further obfuscated with a randomly generated 32-byte\nRC4 key, base64 encoded (together with the prepended RC4 key) and saved to the registry\nunder HKCU\\Software\\Zeppelin\\Keys as “Public Key” and “Encrypted Private Key” respectively:\n\n_Figure 8: Encryption of the victim's private key_\n\nA unique victim ID is then created using the first 11 bytes of the victim's RSA public key\nmodulus and replacing the third and seventh character with a dash \"-\" character. An example\nID for the keys shown above would be 389-04C-3D7.\n\n## File Encryption\n\nZeppelin will enumerate files on all drives and network shares to build a list of directories.\nDepending on the binary type, it will either use the WNetEnumResource API (if running as an\nEXE) or the following command (if running as a DLL):\n\n**chcp 1250 && net view**\n\nFor each file that doesn’t match the excluded files/extensions list, the malware will perform the\nfollowing actions:\n\n\n-----\n\n1.   Save the original file attributes and access times to memory and set\nFILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE\n\n2.   Prepend a \"666\" string to the plain text file\n\n3.   Generate a random 32-byte AES symmetric key and 16-byte Initialization Vector (IV)\n\n4.   Encrypt the file using AES-256 in CBC mode (only the first 0x10000 bytes, the rest of the\nfile content remains unencrypted)\n\n5.   Encrypt the AES key with the victim's public RSA key and then further obfuscate it with a\nrandomly generated 32-byte RC4 key:\n\n_Figure 9: AES key encryption_\n\n6.   Prepend a hardcoded marker string to the encrypted file, together with the 8-byte length of\nencrypted data and 8-byte length of original data (including previously added 3-byte \"666\"\nstring):\n\n_Figure 10: Encrypted file header; marker string (green) and file sizes (red), followed by_\n_encrypted content_\n\n7.   Append the following information after the encrypted file content:\n\n**Length** **Description**\n\n4 Length of the next field\n\n0x28 (40) 32-byte RC4 key followed by 8 encrypted zero bytes\n\n4 Length of the next field\n\n0xBB (187) RC4 obfuscated, RSA-encrypted AES key\n\n4 Length of the next field\n\n0x4F4 (1268) Victim’s private key asymmetrically encrypted with the attacker’s public key\n\n4 Size of data to encrypt\n\n\n-----\n\n8 Original file size\n\n4 Size of all appended data\n\n_Figure 11: Encrypted file footer_\n\n8.   Rename the file to append the victim’s unique ID as an extension\n\n9.   Set the file attributes and access times back to original\n\n10. Proceed to the next file\n\nIf Zeppelin is running as an executable, the first instance of the ransomware will encrypt the\nfiles on the current logical drive and spawn a number of subsequent processes with the \"agent\" parameter. These processes are responsible for encrypting files on other drives and\nnetwork shares. All paths to encrypt are stored under the HKCU\\Software\\Zeppelin\\Paths\nregistry key.\n\nInterestingly, some of the samples will encrypt only the first 0x1000 bytes (4KB), instead of\n0x10000 (65KB). It might be either an unintended bug, or a conscious choice to speed up the\nencryption process while rendering most files unusable anyway.\n\nAfter encrypting all files, Zeppelin will drop a ransom note text file and display it in notepad. The\nfilename and contents are configurable by the attacker. BlackBerry Cylance researchers have\nuncovered several different versions, ranging from short, generic messages to more elaborate\nransom notes tailored to individual organisations. All the messages instruct the victim to\ncontact the attacker via a provided email addresses and quote their personal ID number. The\nattackers are using several secure email providers that are notoriously associated with\nransomware, such as firemail[.]cc, Protonmail and Tutanota. Additionally, one of the ransom\nnotes uncovered provides an email address associated with a .onion domain that is only\naccessible via Tor.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRansomware, once in decline, has experienced a resurgence due to the efforts of innovative\nthreat actors. For example, the actors behind Zeppelin demonstrate a dedication to their craft\nby deploying precise attacks against high-profile targets in the IT and health sectors. Targeting\nspecific organizations rather than every reachable user is just one example of how ransomware\nattacks continue to evolve. The ongoing refinement of ransomware attacks serves as a stark\nreminder that effective cyber security should be proactive, predictive, adaptive, and semiautonomous.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlackBerry Cylance researchers aim to keep organizations one step ahead of cyberattacks by\nsharing threat analysis like this with the public.
