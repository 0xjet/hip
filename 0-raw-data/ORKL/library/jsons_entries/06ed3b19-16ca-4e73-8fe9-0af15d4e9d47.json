    "plain_text": "# Cyberattacks target international conference attendees\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/28/cyberattacks-phosphorus-t20-munich-security-conference/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/28/cyberattacks-phosphorus-t20-munich-security-conference/)**\n\nOctober 28, 2020\n\nToday, we’re sharing that we have detected and worked to stop a series of cyberattacks from\nthe threat actor Phosphorus masquerading as conference organizers to target more than 100\nhigh-profile individuals. Phosphorus, an Iranian actor, has targeted with this scheme potential\nattendees of the upcoming Munich Security Conference and the Think 20 (T20) Summit in\nSaudi Arabia. The Munich Security Conference is the most important gathering on the topic\nof security for heads of state and other world leaders, and it has been held annually for\nnearly 60 years. Likewise, T20 is a highly visible event that shapes policy ideas for the G20\nnations and informs their critical discussions.\n\nBased on current analysis, we do not believe this activity is tied to the U.S. elections in any\nway.\n\nThe attackers have been sending possible attendees spoofed invitations by email. The\nemails use near-perfect English and were sent to former government officials, policy experts,\nacademics and leaders from non-governmental organizations. Phosphorus helped assuage\nfears of travel during the Covid-19 pandemic by offering remote sessions.\n\nWe believe Phosphorus is engaging in these attacks for intelligence collection purposes. The\nattacks were successful in compromising several victims, including former\nambassadors and other senior policy experts who help shape global agendas and foreign\npolicies in their respective countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Flow of a typical Phosphorus attack in this campaign_\n\nThis activity was uncovered by Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center, or MSTIC, which\ntracks the world’s nation-state and cybercrime actors so we can better protect our customers.\nMSTIC is also critical to the work of our Defending Democracy Program, powering our\n[AccountGuard threat notification service available in 30 countries worldwide and fueling the](https://www.microsoftaccountguard.com/en-us/)\n[intelligence we share to help keep elections secure. We build new protections into our](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)\nproducts regularly based on the threats MSTIC uncovers.\n\nWe’ve already worked with conference organizers who have warned and will continue to\nwarn their attendees, and we’re disclosing what we’ve seen so that everyone can remain\nvigilant to this approach being used in connection with other conferences or events.\n\nWe recommend people evaluate the authenticity of emails they receive about major\nconferences by ensuring that the sender address looks legitimate and that any embedded\nlinks redirect to the official conference domain. As always, enabling multi-factor\nauthentication across both business and personal email accounts will successfully thwart\nmost credential harvesting attacks like these. For anyone who suspects they may have been\na victim of this campaign, we also encourage a close review of email-forwarding rules in\naccounts to identify and remove any suspicious rules that may have been set during a\nsuccessful compromise.\n\nWe are also sharing the indicators of compromise (IOCs) observed during these activities.\nWe encourage IT teams to implement detections and protections to identify possible prior\ncampaigns and prevent future campaigns against their users. These indicators include phony\nemail accounts and domains or websites used to steal victims’ credentials.\n\n**INDICATOR** **TYPE** **DESCRIPTION**\n\n\n-----\n\nt20saudiarabia[@]outlook.sa Email Masquerading as the organizer of\nthe Think 20 (T20) conference\n\nt20saudiarabia[@]hotmail.com Email Masquerading as the organizer of\nthe Think 20 (T20) conference\n\nt20saudiarabia[@]gmail.com Email Masquerading as the organizer of\nthe Think 20 (T20) conference\n\nmunichconference[@]outlook.com Email Masquerading as the organizer of\nthe Munich Security Conference\n\nmunichconference[@]outlook.de Email Masquerading as the organizer of\nthe Munich Security Conference\n\nmunichconference1962[@]gmail.com Email Masquerading as the organizer of\nthe Munich Security Conference\n\nde-ma[.]online Domain Domain used for credential\nharvesting\n\ng20saudi.000webhostapp[.]com Subdomain Subdomain used for credential\nharvesting\n\nksat20.000webhostapp[.]com Subdomain Subdomain used for credential\nharvesting\n\n[As we noted in our recent Digital Defense Report, nation-state cyberattackers routinely](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/29/microsoft-digital-defense-report-cyber-threats/)\npursue think tanks, policy organizations and governmental and non-governmental\norganizations, seeking information that an attacker can use for their benefit. We will continue\nto use a combination of technology, operations, legal action and policy to disrupt and deter\nmalicious activity, but nothing replaces vigilance from people who are likely targets of these\noperations.\n\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [Defending Democracy Program,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/defending-democracy-program/) [Microsoft AccountGuard,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/microsoft-accountguard/)\n[Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/microsoft-threat-intelligence-center/) [MSTIC](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/mstic/)\n\n\n-----",
