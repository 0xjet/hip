Each\nstage of the deobfuscation process results with the decryption methods for the\nsubsequent stages to finally arrive at the actual malicious downloader method.\nThe campaign is the latest example of threat actors abusing cloud services like\nMicrosoft Azure and Amazon Web Services and are actively misusing them to\nachieve their malicious objectives.\nThe actor is using the DuckDNS dynamic DNS service to change domain names of\nthe C2 hosts.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThreat actors are increasingly using cloud technologies to achieve their objectives without\nhaving to resort to hosting their own infrastructure. These types of cloud services like\nAzure and AWS allow attackers to set up their infrastructure and connect to the internet\nwith minimal time or monetary commitments. It also makes it more difficult for defenders\nto track down the attackers' operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actor in this case used cloud services to deploy and deliver variants of\ncommodity RATs with the information stealing capability starting around Oct. 26, 2021.\nThese variants of Remote Administration Tools (RATs) are packed with multiple features\nto take control over the victim's environment to execute arbitrary commands remotely and\nsteal the victim's information.\n\nThe initial infection vector is a phishing email with a malicious ZIP attachment. These ZIP\narchive files contain an ISO image with a malicious loader in the form of JavaScript, a\nWindows batch file or Visual Basic script. When the initial script is executed on the\nvictim's machine, it connects to a download server to download the next stage, which can\nbe hosted on an Azure Cloud-based Windows server or an AWS EC2 instance.\n\nTo deliver the malware payload, the actor registered several malicious subdomains using\nDuckDNS, a free dynamic DNS service. The malware families associated with this\ncampaign are variants of the Netwire, Nanocore and AsyncRAT remote access trojans.\n\nOrganizations should be inspecting outgoing connections to cloud computing services for\nmalicious traffic. The campaigns described in this post demonstrate increasing usage of\npopular cloud platforms for hosting malicious infrastructure.\n\n_Infection summary diagram._\n\n## The Payload\n\n[The observed campaigns are using variants of Nanocore,](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/04/a-year-of-fajan-evolution-and-bloomberg.html%23more) [Netwire and](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/operation-armor-piercer.html) [AsyncRAT as](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/08/rat-campaign-targets-latin-america.html)\npayloads These are commodity RATs that were widely used in other campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\n**NanocoreRAT**\n\nNanocore is a 32-bit .NET portable executable first seen in the wild in 2013. After 2017,\nthere are leaked versions of Nanocore that are widely used by the threat actors in their\ncampaigns.\n\nExtracting the configuration information from the Nanocore clients samples associated\nwith this campaign showed us they are using version 1.2.2.0, which is a leaked version\nwith an Oct. 26, 2021 build date. The C2 server used is mback5338[.]duckdns[.]org,\nlistening on the TCP port 7632. The build date correlates with the possible start of the\ncampaign.\n\n_Nanocore variant config file._\n\nWe have also observed other C2 domains and different port numbers used by different\nsamples of Nanocore client associated with these campaigns:\n\nnanoboss[.]duckdns[.]org\njustinalwhitedd554[.]duckdns[.]org\n\nThe plugins included with the payload are the Client and SurveillanceEx plugins. The\nclient plugin is used by the RAT to handle the communications with the C2 server and\nSurveillanceEX plugin provides video and audio capture and the remote desktop\ncapability.\n\n**NetwireRAT**\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwireRAT is a known threat used by the threat actors to steal victim s passwords, login\ncredentials and credit card data. It has the capability to remotely execute the commands\nand collects filesystem information.\n\nThis trojan establishes persistance by writing the registry keys:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\NETwIRe\\HostId\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\NETwIRe\\Install Date\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOfttware\\Microsoft\\WIndows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\SysWOW32\nwith its value as the path to the trojan.\n\n**AsyncRAT**\n\nAsyncRAT is a remote access tool meant to remotely monitor and control computers\nthrough secure encrypted connection. Threat actors in this campaign use the AsyncRAT\nclient by setting its configuration to connect to the C2 server and provide the attacker with\nremote access to the victim's machine. Using some of its features such as keylogger,\nscreen recorder, system configuration manager, the attacker can steal confidential data\nfrom the victim's machine.\n\nAsyncRAT creates the mutex \"AsyncMutex_6SI8OkPnk\" as the infection marker in the\nvictim's machine.\n\n_AsyncRAT variant mutex function._\nThe AsyncRAT config file is decrypted and contains the configuration information such as\nC2 domain. In this instance, the C2 domain is asyncmoney[.]duckdns[.]org using the TCP\nport 7829. We have observed that this variant of AsyncRAT communicates with the C2\ndomain via TCP ports 7840, 7841 and 7842.\n\n\n-----\n\n_AsyncRAT variant C2 connection parameters._\n\n## Infection chain\n\nThe infection chain starts with an email that contains malicious ZIP documents. The ZIP\nfile attachment is an ISO image file containing the loader in JavaScript, Visual Basic script\nor a Windows batch file format. The actor has attempted to entice recipients by purporting\nthat the attachment is a fake invoice document.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Phishing email example._\n\nThe initial few characters of the ZIP file names are randomly generated and could be\nspecific to the campaign. Some of the observed ZIP file names are:\n\nWROOT_Invoice_Copy.zip\nYUEOP_Invoice_Copy.zip\nHOO8M_Invoice_Copy.zip\nTROOS_Invoice_Copy.zip\nTBROO1_Invoice_Copy.zip\n\n**JavaScript Downloader**\n\nThe downloader JavaScript is an obfuscated script that has four layers of obfuscation.\nThe deobfuscation process is performed at each stage with every next stage generated\nas the result of the previous stage deobfuscation function.\n\nLayer 1 deobfuscation\n\nThe first level of decryption is performed by the function 'ejv()', which iterates over each\ncharacter of the obfuscated data into an array and performs a number of arithmetic\noperations to decrypt the character and returns the deobfuscated result.\n\n\n-----\n\n_First level decryption function._\n\nThe function 'ejv()' generates the second-stage decryption routine.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Second level decryption function._\n\nLayer 2 deobfuscation\n\nThe remaining part of the encrypted contents of the JavaScript downloader are decrypted\nin two sub-phases in Layer 2 deobfuscation process. First, it is decrypted by the\ndecryption function 'ejv()' and then the result is passed to the second-level decryption\nfunction.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe result of the deobfuscation process contains another decryption function Ox$(),\nwhich is the third layer decryption function.\n\n_Third-level decryption function._\n\nLayer 3 deobfuscation\n\nThe encrypted strings of the Layer 2 deobfuscation process are decrypted by the function\n'Ox$()'. The decrypted result of the Layer 3 deobfuscation process is another obfuscated\nfunction which has multiple function calls returning values and a series of eval() functions\ncalling the third-level decryption function 'Ox$()' to decrypt the malicious downloader\ncode.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Obfuscated malicious downloader code._\nWhile analysing another sample of the JavaScript downloader of this campaign, we\nobserved a slightly different result from the Phase 3 deobfuscation process. It is likely that\nthe code is automatically generated and randomized to make the detection process more\ndifficult.\n\n_Obfuscated malicious downloader code._\n\nLayer 4 deobfuscation\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final stage of the deobfuscation of malicious downloader code is performed in Layer\n4, with the help of a third-level decryption function and some of its self decryption logic\nwithin the code. We observed that the Layer 4 decrypted code is not just a downloader —\nit also performs other activities such as:\n\nConfigures the Logon Auto Start registry key\n\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" to\nestablish persistence.\nConfigures scheduled task jobs by invoking the schtasks.exe process.\n\nDownloads the payload from the download server with the URL\nhttp://gg1592661[.]duckdns[.]org:7924/vre. The payloads downloaded by the\nobserved campaigns are the variants of Netwire, Nanocore and AsyncRAT remote\naccess trojans, saved and executed from the user's temporary folder of the victim's\nmachine.\nThe script attempts to interact with the Alternate Data Stream to hide the\ninformation about its source as downloaded from the internet.\nCollects information from the registry key\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\nNT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductId to fingerprint the victim's machine.\n\nAside from the JavaScript loader trojan, we have observed a Batch file downloader trojan\nand a VBScript downloader trojan in our Cisco Secure Endpoint telemetry.\n\n**Batch file downloader**\n\nThe batch script contains an obfuscated command that runs PowerShell to download and\nrun a payload from a download server, in this instance, 13[.]78[.]209[.]105 on Azure\nCloud.\n\n_Batch script downloader trojan._\n\n**VBScript downloader**\n\nObfuscated VB downloaders execute a PowerShell command which runs and connects to\nthe download server, for example, to 52[.]27[.]15[.]250, running on AWS EC2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_VBScript trojan downloader._\n\n**PowerShell dropper**\n\nOur investigation of download servers in Azure uncovered a PowerShell dropper script\nwhich appears to be built with HCrypt builder. The script drops and runs a variant of\nAsyncRAT trojan in the victim machine. TrendMicro researchers had identified similar\n[PowersSell droppers in another campaign they named \"Water Basilisk.\"](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_no/research/21/i/Water-Basilisk-Uses-New-HCrypt-Variant-to-Flood-Victims-with-RAT-Payloads.html)\n\n_PowerShell dropper._\nThe deobfuscated binary is constructed using the String replace function to replace all\noccurrences of a delimiter character with the digit 0. This string containing the payload,\ntogether with a string containing an injector .NET assembly DLL module, is passed to the\nfunction H2, which converts it into a binary byte array. From there on, the generated byte\narray is loaded as an assembly module and used to inject the payload.\n\n_Deobfuscated injector._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Deobfuscated PowerShell loader command._\nThe script attempts to launch a process aspnet_compiler.exe on the victim machine,\ninject the AsyncRAT payload and invoke a thread to run the payload. In this instance, the\nC2 server for the payload is yuri101[.]duckdns[.]org, hosted on the IP address\n64[.]188[.]16[.]134.\n\n_PowerShell dropper infection flow._\n\n## Actor's Infrastructure\n\nThe actor in this campaign maintains a distributed infrastructure consisting of download\nservers, command and control servers, and malicious subdomains. The downloading\nservers are hosted on Microsoft Azure and AWS cloud services. We have discovered\nWindows instances on Azure Cloud at the IP addresses shown below:\n\n13[.]78[.]209[.]105 in the WestCentralUS cloud region with FQDN name \"GOOGLE\".\n23[.]102[.]1[.]5 in the NorthEurope cloud region and enabled with SMB\nauthentication.\n40[.]85[.]140[.]7 in the NorthEurope cloud region.\n52[.]150[.]26[.]35 in the EastUS cloud region with FQDN \"spinxamp\".\n13[.]82[.]65[.]56 in the East US cloud region.\n137[.]135[.]65[.]29 in the East US region with FQDN \"sj-2nd\" and enabled with SMB\nauthentication.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother server we discovered is hosted on AWS cloud at the IP address 52[.]27[.]15[.]250\nand the FQDN is ec2-52-27-15-250.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com. We are not\nsure about the operating system of this instance.\n\nSome of the download servers are running the Apache web server application. The HTTP\nservers are configured to allow the listing of open directories that contain variants of\nNanocoreRATs, Netwire RAT and AsyncRATs malware.\n\n_Open directory of malware repositories in a download server._\nEach RAT instance connects to a C2 server according to its configuration. The C2 servers\nare Windows-based servers mostly compromised by the actor at the IP address\n103[.]151[.]123[.]194,185[.]249[.]196[.]175 and 64[.]188[.]16[.]134. For the RATs' C2\ndomains, the actor is using the dynamic DNS service subdomains\nasyncmoney[.]duckdns[.]org, nwire733[.]duckdns[.]org, mback5338[.]duckdns[.]org and\nyuri101[.]duckdns[.]org.\n\n## Malicious domains\n\nDuckDNS is a free dynamic DNS service providing a public DNS server service allowing\nthe user to create subdomains and maintain the records using the DuckDNS scripts. The\nactor has created malicious DuckDNS subdomains to deliver malware in this campaign.\nSome of the actor-controlled malicious subdomains resolve to the download server on\nAzure Cloud while others resolve to the servers operated as C2 for the remote access\ntrojan payloads.\n\ngg1592661[.]duckdns[.]org\nbtime1624[.]duckdns[.]org\njustinalwhitedd554[.]duckdns[.]org\nwz303811[.]duckdns[.]org\njs1994[.]duckdns[.]org\nbacku4734[.]duckdns[.]org\nwww[.]backu4734[.]duckdns[.]org\nmback5338[.]duckdns[.]org\nnwire733[.]duckdns[.]org\n\n\n-----\n\nasyncmoney[.]duckdns[.]org\nnanoboss[.]duckdns[.]org\nasyncspread[.]duckdns[.]org\ntdeasy[.]duckdns[.]org\ndingspread[.]duckdns[.]org\nasyncpcc[.]duckdns[.]org\njw9428875.duckdns[.]org\nmeunknown.duckdns[.]org\nyuri101.duckdns[.]org\n\nCisco Umbrella classified these domains as malicious on Oct. 26. The volume of DNS\nrequests observed in Cisco Umbrella for most of the subdomains associated with this\ncampaign shares the same pattern as shown in the graph, which demonstrates that the\ncampaigns started in October 2021.\n\n_DNS requests for gg1592661[.]duckdns[.]org._\n\n## Victimology\n\nAccording to the DNS request distribution to the malicious subdomains of this campaign,\nwe are observing requests primarily from the United States, Canada, Italy and Singapore.\nWe are also seeing a few requests from Spain and South Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this post we have described campaigns demonstrating that threat actors are actively\nusing cloud services in their malicious campaigns. The initial infection vector is primarily a\nphishing email with a malicious Zip file attachment.Despite being one of the oldest\ninfection vectors, email is still an important infection path which needs to be protected.\n\nThe ZIP file contains an ISO image file containing a malicious obfuscated downloader.\nThe payloads of these campaigns are instances of Nanocore, Netwire and AsyncRAT\nremote access trojans. The RAT payloads are using DuckDNS.org dynamic DNS servers\nso they can regularly change the IP addresses of C2 servers and quickly add new\nsubdomains.\n\nWe also discovered an obfuscated PowerShell dropper script built by HCrypt builder\nassociated with the download servers of this campaign.\n\nOrganizations should deploy comprehensive multi-layered security controls to detect\nsimilar threats and safeguard their assets. Defenders should monitor traffic to their\norganization and implement robust rules around the script execution policies on their\nendpoints. It is even more important for organizations to improve email security to detect\nand mitigate malicious email messages and break the infection chain as early as\npossible.\n\n## Coverage\n\n\n-----\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
