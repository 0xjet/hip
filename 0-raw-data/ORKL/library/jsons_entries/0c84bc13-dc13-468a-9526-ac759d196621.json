Reuters later](https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/) [reported that these victims were Cox](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber/solarwinds-hackers-broke-into-u-s-cable-firm-and-arizona-county-web-records-show-idUSKBN28S2B9)\nCommunications and Pima County.\n\nWe can now reveal that the internal AD domain of all SUNBURST deployments in FireEye's\n[IOC list can be extracted from publicly available DNS logs published by twitter user VriesHd,](https://twitter.com/VriesHd/status/1339673992307892224)\n[a.k.a. \"Kira 2.0\", with help of our SunburstDomainDecoder tool. The data published by](https://netresec.com/?b=20C0f71)\nVriesHd is the most complete SUNBURST DNS collection we've seen, with over 35.000\navsvmcloud.com subdomains! Here is FireEye's IOC table completed with our findings:\n\n\n**Leaked**\n\n**AD Domain** **Sunburst C2 FQDN**\n\ncentral.pima.gov 6a57jk2ba1d9keg15cbg.appsyncapi.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud.com\n\ncentral.pima.gov 7sbvaemscs0mc925tb99.appsyncapi.us-west-2.avsvmcloud.com\n\ncentral.pima.gov gq1h856599gqh538acqn.appsyncapi.us-west-2.avsvmcloud.com\n\ncoxnet.cox.com ihvpgv9psvq02ffo77et.appsyncapi.us-east-2.avsvmcloud.com\n\ncorp.qualys.com k5kcubuassl3alrf7gm3.appsyncapi.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud.com\n\ncorp.qualys.com mhdosoksaccf9sni9icp.appsyncapi.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud.com\n\n**Victims Targeted with SUNBURST Stage 2 Backdoor**\n\n\n**Stage 2**\n\n**CNAME**\n\n\n**Timestamp**\n**(UTC)**\n\n\nfreescanonline[.]com 2020-06-13\n09:00\n\ndeftsecurity[.]com 2020-06-11\n22:30\n\nthedoccloud[.]com 2020-06-13\n08:30\n\nfreescanonline[.]com 2020-06-20\n02:30\n\nthedoccloud[.]com 2020-07-22\n17:00\n\nthedoccloud[.]com 2020-07-23\n18:30\n\n\n-----\n\nIt was not just the victims listed in FireEye s IOC that were specifically targeted by the\n[SUNBURST operators. As explained in our Finding Targeted SUNBURST Victims with pDNS](https://netresec.com/?b=2113a6a)\nblog post, the \"STAGE2\" flag in SUNBURST's DNS beacons can be used to reveal additional\norganizations that were singled out as interesting targets by the threat actors.\n\nWe'd like to stress that the majority of all companies and organizations that have installed a\nbackdoored SolarWinds Orion update were never targeted by the threat actors. This means\nthe these SUNBURST backdoors never made it past what we call \"Stage 1 operation\",\n[where the backdoor encodes the internal AD domain name and installed security products](https://netresec.com/?b=20C1c3b)\ninto DNS requests. SUNBURST backdoors in Stage 1 operation cannot accept any\ncommands from the C2 server without first progressing into Stage 2 operation. We estimate\nthat about 99.5% of the installed SUNBURST backdoors never progressed into Stage 2\noperation.\n\nHere is the full list of internal AD domain names from the SUNBURST deployments in\nVriesHd's DNS data that actually did enter Stage 2 operation according to our analysis:\n\n[central.pima.gov (confirmed)](https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/121820_solarwinds_pima_hacking/solarwinds-govt-hack-hit-pima-county-servers/)\n[cisco.com (confirmed)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/cisco-latest-victim-of-russian-cyber-attack-using-solarwinds)\n[corp.qualys.com (confirmed)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/01/25/solarwinds-hacks-virginia-regulator-and-5-billion-cybersecurity-firm-confirmed-as-targets/)\n[coxnet.cox.com (confirmed)](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-cyber/solarwinds-hackers-broke-into-u-s-cable-firm-and-arizona-county-web-records-show-idUKKBN28S2CT)\nddsn.gov\nfc.gov\nfox.local\n[ggsg-us.cisco.com (confirmed)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/cisco-latest-victim-of-russian-cyber-attack-using-solarwinds)\n[HQ.FIDELIS (confirmed)](https://fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/data-protection/ongoing-analysis-solarwinds-impact/)\njpso.gov\nlagnr.chevrontexaco.net\nlogitech.local\nlos.local\n[mgt.srb.europa* (confirmed)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/01/25/solarwinds-hacks-virginia-regulator-and-5-billion-cybersecurity-firm-confirmed-as-targets/?sh=111ff6687f17)\nng ds army mil\n\n\n-----\n\n[nsanet.local (not the NSA)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/01/25/solarwinds-hacks-virginia-regulator-and-5-billion-cybersecurity-firm-confirmed-as-targets/)\n[paloaltonetworks* (confirmed)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-supply-chain-attack-timeline/)\nphpds.org\n[scc.state.va.us (confirmed)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/01/25/solarwinds-hacks-virginia-regulator-and-5-billion-cybersecurity-firm-confirmed-as-targets/)\nsuk.sas.com\nvgn.viasatgsd.com\nwctc.msft\nWincoreWindows.local\n\nOur [SUNBURST STAGE2 Victim Table has now been updated with additional details about](https://netresec.com/?b=2113a6a)\nthe STAGE2 signaling from these SUNBURST implants, including timestamps,\navsvmcloud.com subdomains and GUID values.\n\n**Initial Microsoft Targeting FAIL**\n\nThe last two entries in the AD domain list above are interesting, since they both hint that the\ntargeted entity might be Microsoft.\n\nThe data that gets exfiltrated in DNS beacons during SUNBURST's initial stage is the\ninternal domain the SolarWinds Orion PC is connected to and a list of installed security\nproducts on that PC. These domain names, security products and possibly also the victims'\npublic IP addresses, was the data available to the attackers when they decided which ones\nthey wanted to proceed to Stage 2 with and thereby activate the HTTPS backdoor built into\nSUNBURST.\n\nThe threat actors were probably surprised when they realized that \"WincoreWindows.local\"\nwas in fact a company in West Virginia that manufactures high quality windows and doors.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actors later found another backdoored SolarWinds Orion machine connected to a\ndomain called \"wctc.msft\", which also sounds like it could be Microsoft. Below is a table\noutlining relevant events for these two SUNBURST deployments that can be extracted from\n[VriesHd's SB2 spreadsheet with](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fpyFt0GL2Swxn0Ihw43eu-kM7HlJXni0EvFYqqMRTz8/) [SunburstDomainDecoder.](https://netresec.com/?b=20C0f71)\n\n**Target ID** **Beaconed Data** **Date**\n\nA887B592B7E5B550 AD domain part 1: \"WincoreW\"\n\nA887B592B7E5B550 AD domain part 2:\n\"indows.local\"\n\nA887B592B7E5B550 AV Products: [none] 202005-22\n\n🤔 _Threat actor decision: Target victim_\n_A887B592B7E5B550_\n\n\nA887B592B7E5B550 STAGE2 request for new C2\nserver in CNAME\n\n🤔 _Threat actor decision: These aren't the_\n_droids we're looking for_\n\n59956D687A42F160 AD domain: \"wctc.msft\"\n\n\n202005-26\n\n\n-----\n\n59956D687A42F160 AV Products: [none] 202006-20\n\n59956D687A42F160 Ping 202006-21\n\n59956D687A42F160 Ping 202006-22\n\n🤔 _Threat actor decision: Target victim_\n_59956D687A42F160_\n\n\n59956D687A42F160 STAGE2 request for new C2\nserver in CNAME\n\n\n202006-23\n\n\n[Microsoft have been public about being hit by SUNBURST (or \"Solorigate\" as they call it), so](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-update/)\nwe can assume that the threat actors eventually located a backdoored SolarWinds Orion\ninstallation in their networks.\n\n**Victim Notification**\n\nWe spent the previous week reaching out to targeted companies and organizations, either\ndirectly or through CERT organizations. From what we understand many of these\norganizations were already aware that they had been targeted victims of SUNBURST, even\nthough they might not have gone public about the breach.\n\n**The Ethical Dilemma**\n\nWe have no intentions to shame the organizations that have installed a backdoored\nSolarWinds Orion update, regardless if they were targeted by the threat actor or not. In fact,\nthe supply chain security problem is an extremely difficult one to tackle, even for companies\nand organizations with very high security standards. This could have happened to anyone!\n\nHowever, since multiple passive DNS logs and SUNBURST victim lists have been circulating\nthrough publicly available channels for over a month, we felt that it was now acceptable to\npublicly write about the analysis we've been doing based on all this data. We'd also like to\nthank everyone who has helped collect and share passive DNS data, including John\nBambenek, [Joe Słowik,](https://twitter.com/jfslowik/status/1338321984527228928) [Rohit Bansal,](https://pastebin.com/6EDgCKxd) [Dancho Danchev,](https://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2020/12/exposing-solarwinds-malware-campaign.html) [Paul Vixie and](https://twitter.com/paulvixie/status/1346557582559694848) [VriesHd.
