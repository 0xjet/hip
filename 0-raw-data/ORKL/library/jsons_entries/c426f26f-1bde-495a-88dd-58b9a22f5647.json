The activity_\n_was identified through a combination of large-scale automated network_\n_traffic analytics and expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded_\n_Future Platform, SecurityTrails, Spur, Farsight, and common open-source_\n_tools and techniques. The report will be of most interest to individuals_\n_engaged in strategic and operational intelligence relating to Indian and_\n_Chinese activity in cyberspace._\n\n_Recorded Future notified the appropriate Indian government_\n_departments prior to publication of the suspected intrusions to support_\n_incident response and remediation investigations within the impacted_\n_organizations._\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nRelations between India and China have deteriorated\nsignificantly following border clashes in May 2020 that\n[resulted in the first combat deaths in 45 years between](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476)\nthe world’s two most populous nations. As a result, on\nJanuary 12, 2021, India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam\nJaishankar [announced that trust between India and](https://www.reuters.com/article/india-foreign-minister-idUSKBN29H0YZ)\nChina was “profoundly disturbed.” While diplomacy and\neconomic factors have been effective in preventing a\n[full-blown war, notable most recently with the bilateral](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-china-ladakh-disengagement-pangong-tso-explained-7184040/)\n[disengagement at the border, cyber operations continue](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-china-ladakh-disengagement-pangong-tso-explained-7184040/)\nto provide countries with a potent asymmetric capability\nto conduct espionage or pre-position within networks\nfor potentially disruptive reasons.\n\nSince early 2020, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group\nobserved a large increase in suspected targeted intrusion\nactivity against Indian organizations from Chinese statesponsored groups. From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded\nFuture’s midpoint collection revealed a steep rise in the\nuse of infrastructure tracked as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE,\nwhich encompasses ShadowPad command and control\n(C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India’s power\nsector. 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations,\nincluding 4 of the 5 Regional Load Despatch Centres\n(RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid\nthrough balancing electricity supply and demand, have\nbeen identified as targets in a concerted campaign\nagainst India’s critical infrastructure. Other targets\nidentified included 2 Indian seaports.\n\n\nUsing a combination of proactive adversary\ninfrastructure detections, domain analysis, and Recorded\nFuture Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined\nthat a subset of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers\nshare some common infrastructure tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs) with several previously reported\nChinese state-sponsored groups, including [APT41 and](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/apt-41-group)\nTonto Team.\n\nDespite some overlaps with previous groups, Insikt\nGroup does not currently believe there is enough\nevidence to firmly attribute the activity in this particular\ncampaign to an existing public group and therefore\ncontinue to track it as a closely related but distinct\nactivity group, RedEcho.\n\n#### Key Judgments\n\n  - The targeting of Indian critical infrastructure\n\noffers limited economic espionage opportunities;\nhowever, we assess they pose significant\nconcerns over potential pre-positioning of\nnetwork access to support Chinese strategic\nobjectives.\n\n  - Pre-positioning on energy assets may support\n\nseveral potential outcomes, including geostrategic signaling during heightened bilateral\ntensions, supporting influence operations, or as a\nprecursor to kinetic escalation.\n\n  - RedEcho has strong infrastructure and\n\nvictimology overlaps with Chinese groups APT41/\nBarium and Tonto Team, while ShadowPad is\nused by at least 5 distinct Chinese groups.\n\n  - The high concentration of IPs resolving to Indian\n\ncritical infrastructure entities communicating\nover several months with a distinct subset\nof AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers used by\nRedEcho indicate a targeted campaign, with little\nevidence of wider targeting in Recorded Future’s\nnetwork telemetry.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: High-level RedEcho TTPs and Recorded Future data sourcing graphic_\n_(Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Border skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan valley in 2020_\n_(Source: Recorded Future Geopolitical Intelligence)_\n\n#### Background\n\n##### India and China’s Escalating Tensions\n\nRecent years have highlighted a growing rivalry between\nthe world’s two most populous countries, as India’s economy\nand geopolitical ambitions seek to compete with those of China.\n[Since May 5, 2020, Indian and Chinese troops have repeatedly](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476)\n[skirmished with one another along the India-China border. Reports](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53061476)\nindicate several likely causes for the escalation, including China’s\nbeing more assertive in border regions in light of international\npressure over the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and\nIndia’s construction of transportation infrastructure in contested\n[areas. China reportedly amassed a large concentration of troops](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/border-dispute-china-has-200-000-troops-at-lac-in-conflict-ready-mode-120072000052_1.html)\nnear the border with India following the initial border escalation,\nand the dispute appears [unresolved. In June 2020, the Indian](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-55793112)\n[government announced it was banning the video-sharing social](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/02/india-banning-chinese-mobile-apps-tiktok-tech-market/)\nmedia platform TikTok from the country, citing fears that the app,\nwhose parent company is the Chinese tech giant ByteDance,\nmight be used to collect data on citizens and potentially also be\nused for espionage to benefit the Chinese government through\n[a wide-ranging cybersecurity](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252485674/Chinese-law-may-require-companies-to-disclose-cyber-security-preparations-outside-China) [law. By late-November 2020, the](https://www.recordedfuture.com/china-cybersecurity-measures/)\n[Indian government had subsequently banned over 200 Chinese](https://www.ft.com/content/025c9a54-5da9-4a11-b131-f375de801bdd)\n[apps in what was described as a “Digital Strike’’ in response to](https://www.ft.com/content/025c9a54-5da9-4a11-b131-f375de801bdd)\nthe Sino-Indian border clashes by India’s technology minister.\n\n\nThese escalating tensions have also been reflected through\nincreased cyber espionage activity by both sides. For example,\nwe observed the suspected Indian state-sponsored group\nSidewinder target Chinese military and government entities in\n[2020, in activity overlapping with recent Trend Micro research.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/sidewinder-leverages-south-asian-territorial-issues-for-spear-ph.html)\nIn the lead-up to the May 2020 skirmishes, we observed a\nnoticeable increase in the provisioning of PlugX malware\nC2 infrastructure, much of which was subsequently used in\nintrusion activity targeting Indian organizations. The PlugX\nactivity included the targeting of multiple Indian government,\npublic sector, and defense organizations from at least May 2020.\nDetailed reporting on these suspected intrusions is available\nto Recorded Future clients. While not unique to Chinese cyber\nespionage activity, PlugX has been heavily used by China-nexus\ngroups for many years. Throughout the remainder of 2020, we\nidentified a heavy focus on the targeting of Indian government\nand private sector organizations by multiple Chinese statesponsored threat activity groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Timeline of Recorded Future PlugX C2 detections aligned with reports of increased geopolitical and military tension between India and China_\n_(Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### ShadowPad — From Exclusivity to Widespread Use\n\n\nShadowPad is a modular backdoor first identified in the\nNetsarang [compromise in 2017, an intrusion later](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/) [attributed](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\nto APT41 (BARIUM) by FireEye. While ShadowPad was initially\nconsidered exclusive to APT41, additional China-nexus groups\nbegan using ShadowPad in network intrusion campaigns\nfrom late 2019. We assess that the sharing of ShadowPad is\nprevalent across groups affiliated with both Chinese Ministry\nof State Security (MSS) and groups affiliated with the People’s\nLiberation Army (PLA), and is likely linked to the presence of a\ncentralized ShadowPad developer or quartermaster responsible\nfor maintaining and updating the tool.\n\nPresently, we are aware of at least 5 Chinese threat activity\n[groups using ShadowPad, including APT41, Tonto Team, groups](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\n[using the Icefog malware,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1347&v=YCwyc6SctYs&feature=youtu.be) [KeyBoy, and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1347&v=YCwyc6SctYs&feature=youtu.be) [Tick. Most recently,](https://www.macnica.net/pdf/mpressioncss_ta_report_2019_4_en.pdf)\n[ShadowPad infrastructure was also connected to a compromise](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\nimpacting the Mongolian business management suite Able\nSoftware. This intrusion featured tooling overlaps with Chinesenexus groups TA428 and LuckyMouse, suggesting that the\nsharing of ShadowPad across Chinese threat activity groups\ncontinues to increase.\n\n\nIn September 2020, 5 Chinese APT41 operators were\n[indicted by the United States (US) government and linked to](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\nthe front company Chengdu 404 Network Technology. One of\nthe accused previously claimed to be “very close” to the MSS,\n[continuing an established trend of Chinese private contractors](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/)\nand front companies conducting cyber espionage activity on\n[behalf of the MSS. Conversely, Tonto Team has been linked to](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/summit/cds-2019/presentations/cds19-executive-s08-achievement-unlocked.pdf)\nthe PLA, specifically the Shenyang Military Region Technical\nReconnaissance Bureau. ShadowPad is the latest in a long line of\nexamples of custom capabilities being shared across disparate\nChinese threat activity groups for use in cyber espionage\nactivity.\n\n#### Threat Analysis\n\nThe network infrastructure used in ShadowPad infections\nis tracked by Insikt Group as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE. This\ntechnique fingerprints unique characteristics including header\nresponses and similar network components. Using a combination\nof proactive infrastructure detections, domain analysis, and\nnetwork traffic analysis, we have determined that a subset\nof these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers are being used by a\nChina-linked activity group we track as RedEcho, to target a\nlarge swath of India’s power sector.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: RedEcho campaign timeline highlighting new domain registrations, proactive adversary infrastructure detection, and suspected exfiltration events from targeted networks, derived from_\n_Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### RedEcho Infrastructure TTPs\n\n\nA subset of the RedEcho AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers\nlisted in table 1 below were configured with domains spoofing\nvarious Indian power generation and electricity transmission\nentities. For example, the ntpc-co[.]com domain is likely\na typosquat of ntpc[.]co[.]in, the website of Indian power\ngeneration company NTPC Limited. The domain was first\nregistered in July 2019, as noted in the Recorded Future new\ndomain registration feed:\n\n_Figure 5: New Domain Registration reference in the Recorded Future portal_\n_(Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\nTyposquat and brand abuse detection are two of the many\nfeatures of Recorded Future’s Brand Intelligence module, enabling\norganizations to proactively hunt for suspicious infrastructure as\nit is being established by adversaries.\n\n|AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE IP Address|Domain(s)|First Seen|Hosting Provider|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|101[.]78[.]177[.]227|websencl[.]com ptciocl[.]com|2020-06-12|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|101[.]78[.]177[.]252|ptciocl[.]com|2020-12-25|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|210[.]92[.]18[.]132|ntpc-co[.]com|2020-12-14|EHOSTICT|\n|218[.]255[.]77[.]52|ptciocl[.]com|2019-09-29|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|223[.]255[.]151[.]74|websencl[.]com|2020-11-18|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|223[.]255[.]155[.]231|ubuntumax[.]com|2021-01-25|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|27[.]255[.]92[.]83|ubuntumax[.]com|2021-02-06|EHOSTICT|\n|223[.]255[.]155[.]238|www.shipcardonlinehelp[.]com|2020-10-12|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|27[.]255[.]94[.]29|ntpc-co[.]com|2020-08-20|EHOSTICT|\n|218[.]255[.]77[.]54|www.smartdevoe[.]com|2020-02-05|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|223[.]255[.]151[.]85|www.smartdevoe[.]com|2020-12-19|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|101[.]78[.]177[.]242|www.smartdevoe[.]com|2020-07-21|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n|218[.]255[.]77[.]40|ptciocl[.]com|2020-11-24|HKBN Enterprise Solutions HK Limited|\n\n\n_Table 1: List of initially identified RedEcho AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure cluster used in targeting of Indian power sector_\n\n\n-----\n\nInsikt Group profiled the identified RedEcho operational\ninfrastructure and identified a pattern of behavior, in line with\n[the concept of viewing network indicators as composite objects.](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects)\nRedEcho’s operational infrastructure modus operandi in the\nidentified intrusion campaign can be summarized as follows:\n\n  - Domains were registered through the registrar WEBCC\n\nand used an uncommon authoritative name server,\neznowdns[.]com\n\n  - RedEcho operational infrastructure associated with the\n\nChinese domain and infrastructure reseller cndns[.]com\n\n  - Used the WhoisProtection WHOIS privacy protection\n\nservice\n\n  - AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure hosted on HKBN\n\nEnterprise Solutions HK Limited (AS9381) and EHOSTICT\n(AS45382)\n\n  - Domains spoofed (lexically similar) Indian entities or\n\nfeatured strings referencing India\n\n  - Used a common top level domain (.com)\n\n  - Used dynamic DNS domains for operational\n\ninfrastructure (further details below)\n\n**Domain** **IP Address**\n\n223[.]255[.]155[.]243\n\nindiasunsung].[com\n\n180[.]150[.]226[.]216\n\n223[.]255[.]155[.]243\n\nixrails].[com\n\n101[.]78[.]177[.]227\n\n223[.]255[.]155[.]247\n\npandorarve].[com\n\n223[.]255[.]155[.]252\n\nindrails].[com 223[.]255[.]155[.]237\n\nescanavupdate].[club 218[.]255[.]77[.]60\n\nastudycarsceu].[net 27[.]255[.]94[.]21\n\n_Table 2: Additional likely RedEcho domains matching infrastructure TTPs_\n\n**Domain**\n\nrailway.sytes[.]net\n\nmodibest.sytes[.]net\n\nindrra.ddns[.]net\n\nindianrailway.hopto[.]org\n\ninraja.ddns[.]net\n\nrailways.hopto[.]org\n\n_Table 3: RedEcho dynamic DNS domains_\n\n\nWhile none of these characteristics are individually unique to\nRedEcho, viewing these holistically identified unique behaviors\nin combination is likely indicative of RedEcho activity.

All 12 organizations likely qualify as critical\ninfrastructure, per the Indian National Critical Information\n[Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) definition.](https://nciipc.gov.in/)\n\nWithin India’s power sector, RedEcho conducted suspected\nnetwork intrusions targeting at least 4 out of the country’s 5\nRegional Load Despatch Centres (RLDCs), alongside 2 State\nLoad Despatch Centres (SLDCs). RLDCs and SLDCs [are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_System_Operation_Corporation)\n\n\n[responsible for ensuring real-time integrated operation of India’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_System_Operation_Corporation)\npower grid through balancing electricity supply and demand\nto maintain a stable grid frequency.

The intrusions were conducted by a\nChina-linked activity group we track as RedEcho. The group\nmade heavy use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE — a term we use\nto track infrastructure that comprises ShadowPad C2s, which is\nshared between several Chinese threat activity groups, including\nAPT41/Barium, Tonto team, the Icefog cluster, KeyBoy, and Tick.\n\nThe intrusions overlap with previous Indian energy sector\ntargeting by Chinese threat activity groups in 2020 that also\nused AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure. Therefore, the\nfocus in targeting India’s electricity system possibly indicates a\nsustained strategic intent to access India’s energy infrastructure.\nNetwork access to Regional Load Despatch Centres provide\nminimal benefit for economic espionage objectives, but are of\nstrategic interest to enable access pre-positioning for a variety\nof potential outcomes such as:\n\n  - To send a robust signaling message as a “show of force”\n\n  - To enable influence operations to sway public opinion\n\nduring a diplomatic confrontation\n\n  - To support potential future disruptive cyber operations\n\nagainst critical infrastructure\n\nAs bilateral tensions continue to rise, we expect to see\na continued increase in cyber operations being conducted\nby China-linked groups such as RedEcho in line with national\nstrategic interests. While economic recovery from the impact of\nthe coronavirus pandemic will be a priority for both countries, the\nincreasing rhetoric and the kinetic escalation of border tensions\nsuggests there is clearly mistrust and uncertainty within each\ngovernment. Further, China will likely also continue to exert\ninfluence over other nations, particularly those that are within\nthe sphere of influence of their BRI investment program, which\nmay lead to more cyber operations aimed at furthering strategic\nadvantage.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix — Indicators\n\n[Readers can access the indicators listed below in our public Insikt Group Github repository: https://github.com/Insikt-Group/](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research)\n[Research (RedEcho - February 2021).](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Recorded Future Threat Activity Group and Malware Taxonomy\n\nRecorded Future’s research group, Insikt, tracks\nthreat actors and their activity, focusing on state actors\nfrom China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as well as cyber\ncriminals - individuals and groups - from Russia, CIS states,\nChina, Iran, and Brazil. We emphasize tracking activity\ngroups and where possible, attributing them to nation state\ngovernment, organizations, or affiliate institutions.\n\nOur coverage includes:\n\n\n**ADVERSARY**\n\n\n\n   - Government organizations and intelligence\nagencies, their associated laboratories, partners,\n\nindustry collaborators, proxy entities, and\nindividual threat actors.\n\n   - Recorded Future-identified, suspected nation\nstate activity groups, such as RedAlpha,\nRedBravo, Red Delta, and BlueAlpha and many\nother industry established groups.\n\n   - Cybercriminal individuals and groups established\nand named by Recorded Future\n\n   - Newly emerging malware, as well as\nprolific,persistent commodity malware\n\nInsikt Group names a new threat activity group or\ncampaign when analysts have data corresponding to at\nleast three points on the Diamond Model of Intrusion\nAnalysis with at least medium confidence, derived from our\nSecurity Intelligence Graph. We can tie this to a threat actor\nonly when we can point to a handle, persona, person, or\norganization responsible. We will write about the activity as\na campaign in the absence of this level of adversary data.\nWe use the most widely-utilized or recognized name for a\n\nparticular group when the public body of empirical evidence\nis clear the activity corresponds to a known group.\n\nInsikt Group utilizes a simple color and phonetic alphabet\nnaming convention for new nation state threat actor groups\nor campaigns. The color corresponds to that nation’s flag\ncolors, currently represented below, with more color/nation\npairings to be added as we identify and attribute new threat\nactor groups associated with new nations.\n\nFor newly identified cybercriminal groups, Insikt\nGroup uses a naming convention corresponding to the\nGreek alphabet. Where we have identified a criminal entity\nconnected to a particular country, we will use the appropriate\ncountry color, and where that group may be tied to a specific\ngovernment organization, tie it to that entity specifically.\n\nInsikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming\nnewly identified malware.\n\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE** **CAPABILITY**\n\n**VICTIM**\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest provider of intelligence for enterprise\n\nsecurity.
