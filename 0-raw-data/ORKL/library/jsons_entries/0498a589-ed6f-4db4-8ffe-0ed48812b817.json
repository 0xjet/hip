Today's diary examines another recent example of an infection caused by Rig EK on\nMonday 2019-06-24.\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark._\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Shown above: Some of the alerts generated by this infection using Security Onion with](https://securityonion.net/)_\n_[Suricata and the](https://suricata-ids.org/)_ _[EmergingThreats Pro ruleset viewed in Sguil.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/et-pro-ruleset)_\n\n**_Malvertising campaign redirect domain_**\n\nEK-based malvertising campaigns have \"gate\" domains that redirect to an EK. In this case,\nthe gate domain was makemoneyeasywith[.]me. According to Domaintools, this domain was\nregistered on 2019-06-19, and indicators of this domain redirecting to Rig EK were reported\nas early as 2019-06-21.\n\n_Shown above: makemoneyeasywith[.]me redirecting to Rig EK landing page on 2019-06-24._\n\n**_Rig EK_**\n\nThe Rig EK activity I saw on 2019-06-24 was similar to Rig EK traffic I documented in an ISC\ndiary last week. See the images below for details.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Rig EK landing page._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Rig EK sends a Flash exploit._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Rig EK sends a malware payload._\n\n**_The malware payload_**\n\n[The malware payload sent by this example of Rig EK appears to be Pitou.B. In my post-](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2016-011823-3733-99)\ninfection activity, I saw several attempts at malspam, but I didn't find DNS queries for any of\nthe mail servers associated with this spam traffic.\n\nPrior to the spam activity, I saw traffic over TCP port 2287 which matched a signature for\nETPRO TROJAN Win32/Pitou.B, and it also fit the description for Pitou.B provided by\nSymantec from 2016. I didn't let my infected Windows host run long enough to generate\nDNS queries for remote locations described in Symantec's Technical Description for this\nTrojan. However, [Any.Run's sandbox analysis of this malware shows DNS queries similar to](https://app.any.run/tasks/85509ead-0530-441c-a14c-c0601f6887d1)\nthe Symantec description that happened approximately 9 to 10 minutes after the initial\ninfection activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Post-infection traffic over TCP port 2287._\n\n_Shown above: Filtering for indications of SMTP traffic in the pcap._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Using the Export Objects function in Wireshark to see successfully sent_\n_spam._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: An example of spam sent from my infected Windows host._\n\n_[Shown above: DNS queries seen from the Any.Run analysis of this Pitou.B sample.](https://app.any.run/tasks/85509ead-0530-441c-a14c-c0601f6887d1)_\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following are IP addresses and domains associated with this infection:\n\n185.254.190[.]200 port 80 - makemoneyeasywith[.]me - Gate domain that redirected\nto Rig EK\n188.225.26[.]48 port 80 - 188.225.26[.]48 - Rig EK traffic\n195.154.255[.]65 port 2287 - Encoded/encrypted traffic caused by the Pitou.B Trojan\nvarious IP addresses over TCP port 25 - spam traffic from the infected Windows host\n[various domains in DNS queries seen from the Any.Run analysis of this Pitou.B sample](https://app.any.run/tasks/85509ead-0530-441c-a14c-c0601f6887d1)\n\nThe following are files associated with this infection:\n\n[SHA256 hash: 9c569f5e6dc2dd3cf1618588f8937513669b967f52b3c19993237c4aa4ac58ea](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9c569f5e6dc2dd3cf1618588f8937513669b967f52b3c19993237c4aa4ac58ea/detection)\n\nFile size: 9,203 bytes\nFile description: Flash exploit sent by Rig EK on 2019-06-24\n\n[SHA256 hash: 835873504fdaa37c7a6a2df33828a3dcfc95ef0a2ee7d2a078194fd23d37cf64](https://app.any.run/tasks/85509ead-0530-441c-a14c-c0601f6887d1)\n\nFile size: 827,904 bytes\nFile description: Pitou.B malware sent by Rig EK on 2019-06-24\n\n**_Final words_**\n\nA pcap of the infection traffic along with the associated malware and artifacts can be found\n[here.](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/06/24/index.html)\n\n--Brad Duncan\nbrad [at] malware-traffic-analysis.net\n\n[Keywords: exploit kit](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=exploit%20kit) [Pitou](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=Pitou) [Rig](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=Rig) [Trojan](https://isc.sans.edu/tag.html?tag=Trojan)\n[0 comment(s)](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Rig+Exploit+Kit+sends+PitouB+Trojan/25068/)\n\nJoin us at SANS!
