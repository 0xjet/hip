Snatch Team was able to go from brute forcing a Domain Administrator (DA) account via RDP, to running a Meterpreter reverse shell and a RDP proxy via Tor on a Domain Controller (DC), to encrypting all Domain joined systems in under 5 hours.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Snatch is a widely known variant due to it causing systems to reboot into safe mode before encrypting the system. SophosLabs has an excellent write up on Snatch which was very similar to what we witnessed.\n\n## Initial Access:\n\n#### Snatch Team logged into a DA account from 193.70.12.240 around 0515 UTC. Initially with that access they performed a simple arp -a.\n\n At 0753 UTC the threat actors made the next move running ipconfig and quser. Just minutes later they began lateral movement initiating an RDP session with a DC.\n\n## Lateral Movement and Persistence:\n\n#### Once on the DC the threat actor moved quickly deploying a tool set in C:\\Windows. This tool set included 2 executable that masqueraded as Windows Management Instrumentation files. One was executed with the following command parameters.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The .dat file turned out to be a configuration file with the executable being TOR creating an RDP tunnel. (Wouldn’t this be really really slow?)\n\n The other executable file in the wmis folder was a Go executable of unknown providence potentially related to utorrent capability?\n\n The next thing they did was create a reverse shell using what we think is Meterpreter. C2 initiated over HTTPS/443 to 91.229.77.161 via cplXen.exe\n\n The presence of logs indicating the use of named pipe services also increases the likelihood of Meterpreter or possibly Cobaltstrike. We didn’t see any ET Pro signatures fire for this activity but we also didn’t have SSL inspection on at the time.\n\n A separate executable was then dropped for stealthy persistence of cplXen.exe. X3.exe is a loader that uses the 3 DLLs (which are ini files) below to run cplXen.\n```\njd4ob7162ns.dll: C:\\windows\\system32\\cplXen.exe /F\nfw0a53482aa.dll: 443\nkb05987631s.dll: 91.229.77.161\n\n Two Scheduled Tasks were created to launch the loader, which in turn persists the loading of cplXen.exe.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n#### x3.exe had a very low VT hit ratio. If anyone wants to investigate this further feel free to contact us to get the file or get it on MISP/VT.\n\n## Action on Objectives:\n\n#### About a half hour after successful C2 we see this\n\n We can conclude that ditsnap was most likely run on the DC to obtain a copy of ntds.dit by creating a snapshot.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Forty-five minutes later Snatch Team had their first blood. They RDP ed into the backup server, turned off Windows Defender, and executed safe.exe. They did this for every machine in the domain and within 15 minutes all machines were ransomed including the DCs. All machines rebooted into safe mode before encrypting causing all logging and remote tools to fail (Damn you safe mode!).\n\n On all machines we are left with the following:\n\n Snatch Team requested 40k USD for the decryptor but with negotiations we were able to talk them down to less than 15k.\n\n## Recovery:\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Let s take a minute to think about what recovery would look like in a large organization. Every server and online machine was rebooted into safe mode without networking which causes you to lose complete visibility. This gets very painful quickly.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\n#### As we’ve seen time and time again, RDP is being brute forced to gain access into the network and then the threat actor moves laterally quickly to install ransomware. Although we were surprised that the threat actors manually RDPed into each system rather than using GPO or PsExec. Even though this attacker did not seem highly skilled they were productive, efficient and in less than 5 hours could have earned 40k (8k per hour).\n\n Enjoy our report?

Thank you for your support!\n\n## Analysis of Safe.exe:\n\n#### Safe.exe is a Go based executable, it drops 4 bat files that kick off the ransom process. It creates a new service to run safe.exe and then sets the system to reboot into safe mode on next boot and then executes a shutdown of the system ASAP. When the system comes back up its in Safe Mode without networking.\n\n https://www.hybrid- analysis.com/sample/3160b4308dd9434ebb99e5747ec90d63722a640d329384b1ed536b59 352dace6/5ee67d6c3156821df34f7f4d\n\n### IOCs:\n\n#### All IOCs in MISPPRiv EID 68226 or UUID 5ee65855-3320-456d-b704-4878950d210f\n\n C2\n```\n91.229.77.161\n\n RDP Access IP’s\n193.70.12.240\n178.162.209.135\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nsafe.exe|2bbff2111232d73a93cd435300d0a07e\n2bbff2111232d73a93cd435300d0a07e\nb93d633d379052f0a15b0f9c7094829461a86dbb\n3160b4308dd9434ebb99e5747ec90d63722a640d329384b1ed536b59352dace6\n\n#### https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3160b4308dd9434ebb99e5747ec90d63722a640d329384b 1ed536b59352dace6/detection\nx3.exe|1422dae0330c713935d50773680fcb39\n1422dae0330c713935d50773680fcb39\nd5a0c796032eda2fe20d1f39bae3fbc4e6407e8c\nb9e4299239880961a88875e1265db0ec62a8c4ad6baf7a5de6f02ff4c31fcdb1\n\n https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b9e4299239880961a88875e1265db0ec62a8c4ad6baf7a5 de6f02ff4c31fcdb1/details\ncplXen.exe|c9a728aa3f5b6f48b68df4bb66b41a5c\n90035ab418033b39d584c7bc609cab1664460069\nc305b75a4333c7fca9d1d71b660530cc98197b171856bf433e4e8f3af0424b11\n\n https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c305b75a4333c7fca9d1d71b660530cc98197b171856bf43 3e4e8f3af0424b11/detection\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n116EBE27202905AFFB94F5C1597D511ABCB5B381411431956A03E47B388582BF.bat|1f7b17cacb0263b84\n1f7b17cacb0263b84cf3e9d4a5429ef9\n14b2948a28d16c05fa7237dd8823592a735ef43f\n116ebe27202905affb94f5c1597d511abcb5b381411431956a03e47b388582bf\n2155A029A024A2FFA4EFF9108AC15C7DB527CA1C8F89CCFD94CC3A70B77CFC57.bat|6d9d31414ee2c1752\n6d9d31414ee2c175255b092440377a88\nc24aee8fa0a81a82fe73bf60e0282b1038d6ea80\n2155a029a024a2ffa4eff9108ac15c7db527ca1c8f89ccfd94cc3a70b77cfc57\n3295F5029F9C9549A584FA13BC6C25520B4FF9A4B2FEB1D9E935CC9E4E0F0924.bat|3d33a19bb489dd585\n3d33a19bb489dd5857b515882b43de12\n0882f2e72f1ca4410fe8ae0fa1138800c3d1561d\n3295f5029f9c9549a584fa13bc6c25520b4ff9a4b2feb1d9e935cc9e4e0f0924\n251427C578EAA814F07037FBE6E388B3BC86ED3800D7887C9D24E7B94176E30D.bat|3e36d3dc132e3a076\n3e36d3dc132e3a076539acc9fcd5535c\n89be35c19a65b9e6f7a277e1a9f66ab76d024378\n251427c578eaa814f07037fbe6e388b3bc86ed3800d7887c9d24e7b94176e30d\nsafe.exe|2bbff2111232d73a93cd435300d0a07e\n2bbff2111232d73a93cd435300d0a07e\nb93d633d379052f0a15b0f9c7094829461a86dbb\n3160b4308dd9434ebb99e5747ec90d63722a640d329384b1ed536b59352dace6\n6C9D8C577DDDF9CC480F330617E263A6EE4461651B4DEC1F7215BDA77DF911E7.bat|54fe4d49d7b447110\n54fe4d49d7b4471104c897f187e07f91\n18f963dbee830e64828991d26a06d058326c1ddb\n6c9d8c577dddf9cc480f330617e263a6ee4461651b4dec1f7215bda77df911e7\nA80C7FE1F88CF24AD4C55910A9F2189F1EEDAD25D7D0FD53DBFE6BDD68912A84.bat|891708936393b69c2\n891708936393b69c212b97604a982fed\n5b86cf095fe515b590d18b2e976d9e544c43f6ca\na80c7fe1f88cf24ad4c55910a9f2189f1eedad25d7d0fd53dbfe6bdd68912a84\n\n#### YARA:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n/\n  YARA Rule Set\n  Author: The DFIR Report\n  Date: 2020-06-17\n  Identifier: snatch-ransomware\n  Reference: https://thedfirreport.com/\n*/\n/* Rule Set ----------------------------------------------------------------- */\nimport \"pe\"\nrule snatch_ransomware_x3_loader {\n  meta:\n   description = \"snatch-ransomware -
