The malware, which is related to the\nolder Crosswalk backdoor (Backdoor.Motnug) has been deployed in recent Grayfly\ncampaigns against a number of organizations in Taiwan, Vietnam, the United States, and\nMexico. A feature of this recent campaign was that a large number of targets were in the\ntelecoms sector. The group also attacked organizations in the IT, media, and finance sectors.\n\n[Sidewalk was recently documented by ESET, who attributed it to a new group it called](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/)\nSparklingGoblin, which it linked to the Winnti malware family. Symantec’s Threat Hunter\nTeam has attributed Sidewalk to Grayfly, a longstanding Chinese espionage operation.\n[Members of the group were indicted in the U.S. in 2020. The recent campaign involving](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/apt41-indictments-china-espionage)\nSidewalk suggests that Grayfly has been undeterred by the publicity surrounding the\nindictments.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Who are Grayfly?\n\nGrayfly (aka GREF and Wicked Panda) is a targeted attack group that has been active since\nat least March 2017 using a custom backdoor known as Backdoor.Motnug (aka\nTOMMYGUN/CROSSWALK), a custom loader called Trojan.Chattak, Cobalt Strike (aka\nTrojan.Agentemis), and ancillary tools in its attacks.\n\nGrayfly has been observed targeting a number of countries in Asia, Europe, and North\nAmerica across a variety of industries, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality,\nmanufacturing, and telecommunications. In more recent activity, Grayfly has continued with\nits focus on telecommunications but has also been observed targeting organizations\noperating within the media, finance, and IT service provider sectors. Typically Grayfly targets\npublicly facing web servers to install web shells for initial intrusion, before spreading further\nwithin the network.\n\nOnce a network has been compromised, Grayfly may install its custom backdoors onto\nadditional systems. These tools allow the attackers to have comprehensive remote access to\nthe network and proxy connections allowing them to access hard-to-reach segments of a\ntarget's network.\n\nAlthough sometimes labeled APT41, we consider Grayfly the espionage arm of APT41.\nSimilarly, Symantec tracks other sub-groups of APT41 separately, such as Blackfly, its cybercrime arm.\n\n## Sidewalk campaign\n\nA characteristic of the recent campaign was that the group appeared to be particularly\ninterested in attacking exposed Microsoft Exchange or MySQL servers. This suggests that\nthe initial vector may be the exploit of multiple vulnerabilities against public-facing servers.\n\nIn at least one attack, the suspicious Exchange activity was followed by PowerShell\ncommands used to install an unidentified web shell. Following this, the malicious backdoor\nwas executed.\n\nAfter the installation of the backdoor, the attackers deployed a custom version of the\ncredential-dumping tool Mimikatz. This version of Mimikatz has been used previously in\nGrayfly attacks.\n\n## Victim case study\n\nThe first indication of attacker activity was identified at 20:39 local time, where a Base64encoded PowerShell command was executed via a legitimate Exchange Server-related\nprocess. The command was used to execute certutil to decode and install a web shell:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n>(^_certutil -decode -f C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList_-.aspx\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList.aspx;if((dir\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList.aspx).Length -eq 212){Remove-Item -Force\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList_*-*.aspx}*\n\n```\nNext, another Base64-encoded PowerShell command was executed. This command was\nused to move the web shell to the Exchange install path, accessible by the attackers –\nspecifically the ClientAccess\\ecp directory.\n\nmv C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList.aspx\n$envExchangeInstallPath\\ClientAccess\\esp\\ -Force\n\nSeveral minutes later, a backdoor was executed via installutil.exe:\n\nCSIDL_WINDOWS\\microsoft.net\\framework64\\v4.0.30319\\installutil.exe /logfile=\n/LogToConsole=false /ParentProc=none /U\nCSIDL_WINDOWS\\microsoft.net\\framework64\\v4.0.30319\\microsoft.webapi.config\n\nRoughly an hour later, the attackers were observed executing a WMIC command in order to\nrun a Windows batch file. This file was used to create a scheduled task to execute the\nbackdoor and ensure persistence:\n\nWMIC /NODE:&quot;172.16.140.234&quot; process call create &quot;cmd.exe /c\nc:\\users\\public\\schtask.bat&quot;\n\nShortly after this, Mimikatz was executed to dump credentials:\n\nsha2:b3eb783b017da32e33d19670b39eae0b11de8e983891dd4feb873d6e9333608d\n(Mimikatz) - csidl_system_drive\\perflogs\\ulsassx64.exe\n\nAfter this point, no further activity was observed.\n\n## Indictments\n\nThree Chinese men were indicted in the U.S. in 2020 for their involvement in attacks that\ninvolved Grayfly tools and tactics. At the time of the indictment, Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, and\nFu Qiang were based in the Chinese city of Chengdu and held senior positions in a company\ncalled Chengdu 404. The company describes itself as a network security specialist and\nclaims to employ a team of white hat hackers who can perform penetration testing along with\nother security operations.\n\nThe indictment charged the men with involvement in attacks against over 100 different\norganizations in the U.S., South Korea, Japan, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia,\nVietnam, India, Pakistan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, and\nThailand. Jiang was said to have a “working relationship” with the Chinese Ministry of State\nSecurity which would provide him and his associates with a degree of state protection.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Likely to continue\n\nGrayfly is a capable actor, likely to continue to pose a risk to organizations in Asia and\nEurope across a variety of industries, including telecommunications, finance, and media. It's\nlikely this group will continue to develop and improve its custom tools to enhance evasion\ntactics along with using commodity tools such as publicly available exploits and web shells to\nassist in their attacks.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
