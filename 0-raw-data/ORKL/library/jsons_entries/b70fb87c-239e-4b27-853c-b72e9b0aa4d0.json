For example,](https://webz.io/dwp/inside-the-underground-world-of-cybercriminal-groups/)\nsome of those have already built their own Tor site, where they publish the targeted\norganizations they’ve allegedly attacked, including leaking some of the databases they claim\nto have compromised (assuming that the negotiation for getting a ransom by the victim\nfailed).\n\nBut a question that has been recently raised is whether these are real or fake ransomware\n**gangs?**\n\nOne of the new ransomware groups whose credibility has been put in question is\n**RansomHouse. So far, the group has published 4 samples of alleged stolen data from 4**\ncompanies (see image below) on their site on Tor. These companies are:\n\nSLGA, a local Canadian liquor and gaming authority\nJefferson CU, a local U.S. bank\nAHS, a German handling service provider\nDellner, a Swedish railroad equipment manufacturer\n\n\n-----\n\n_A_\n\n_screenshot of the Tor site operated by the RansomHouse gang_\n\nUsers on Twitter, Telegram, and dark web forums have been debating whether\nRansomHouse is a real ransomware gang that is responsible for attacking and stealing those\ndatabases, or an extortion group that buys leaked databases from a third party and tries to\nextort the victims by demanding a ransom fee in return for not leaking the data to the public.\n\n## How can you verify whether a ransomware group is real or fake?\n\n**Step #1: Use Publicly available records and announcements**\n\nThe very first step should be to check the details that are publicly available. For example,\nhave the companies suffered a ransomware attack?\n\n[According to an announcement made by Jefferson Credit Union, they admitted that they](https://www.mass.gov/doc/assigned-data-beach-number-25929-jefferson-credit-union/download)\nwere hit by a ransomware attack, in which the company’s files were encrypted. According to\nCBC News, RansomHouse affiliates contacted SLGA, claiming to have encrypted the\n\n\n-----\n\nauthority s system using ransomware.\n\nAs for AHS, they were targeted by a cyberattack but whether it was a ransomware attack\nremains unknown. Deliner has not yet clarified whether they suffered a cyberattack at all.\n\nNone of these announcements are damning evidence that the RansomHouse group was\nbehind the attack. They could’ve hired ransomware from a different gang to carry out the\nattack, or they could not have even been involved in these attacks at all.\n\nIn order to get proof that this ransomware group is a valid, real ransomware group, we need\nto turn to the spaces where ransomware and other cybercriminal groups operate every day –\nthe deep and dark web. Using Webz.io’s Cyber API, we took a closer look at RansomHouse\nin an effort to trace their activities and find out whether they are a real ransomware group or\nnot.\n\n**Step #2: Use Deep and Dark Web to trace the activities of ransomware groups**\n\nThere are various places on the deep and dark web where you can start studying\nransomware groups more closely. We first started with the obvious option- their site.\n\n**The site of the RansomHouse group**\n\nWe found the official site of the RansomHouse group on the Tor network. Here was the very\nfirst unusual finding we traced. If you look at the images below, you can see a strong\nresemblance between the design and layout of the site used by the RansomHouse group\nand the one Hive ransomware gang uses. Some would say that it could be an indication that\nthe RansomHouse group is either an extension of Hive or that they work for a group that is\nalso behind the Hive ransomware.\n\nA\n\ncompromised enterprise that is posted on the Hive ransomware site\n\n\n-----\n\nA\n\ncompromised enterprise that is posted on the RansomHouse ransomware site\n\n**RansomHouse on Telegram**\n\nNext, we turned to the deep web and took a look at Telegram, where RansomHouse, like\nmany other cybercriminals groups, including ransomware gangs, also operates.\n\nHow do they use Telegram?\n\n1. A private user – the group is operating a private user on Telegram to allegedly\n\ncommunicate and negotiate with the victims regarding the ransom fee\n2. A Telegram channel – is used to announce the names of the companies they attacked\n\nand threaten to expose their data.\n3. A group – this is a highly unusual group RansomHouse use for PR relations, where\n\nthey’re communicating with verified journalists and share exclusive information a few\nhours or even days before the leak is published on the platforms they maintain.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Messages that were sent in the PR group_\n\n_of RansomHouse, where they are trying to verify the identity of a person who identifies as a_\n_journalist._\n\nIn the image below, you can see that one of the members on the PR group RansomHouse\nmaintains on Telegram, has recently asked the ransomware group if they are responsible for\nthe cyberattacks they mention on their platforms or if they just publish data from other\nransomware groups. So far, RansomHouse hasn’t responded.\n\nThe group also uses Telegram for other PR campaigns. For example, they post messages\non several cyber groups on Telegram where they announce the names of the latest data leak\nvictims and publicize their Tor sites and Telegram groups.\n\nYou can see an example of these types of “PR campaigns” on Telegram in the following\nimage, where RansomHouse gang announces that the leak of SLGA’s data is up on the\n“Cyber Security experts” group on Telegram:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The screenshot was taken from our Cyber API UI._\n\nMany of these posts were quietly removed by the admins of the groups, shortly after they\nwere published. Because even on the dark and deep web, threat actors are reported and\nblocked if they violate the terms of the community.\n\nIn the next image you can see how several members reported on Ransomhouse on one of\nthe Telegram groups they posted their “PR messages”:\n\n_A Telegram group, where_\n\n_RansomHouse was reported to the admins and blocked after publishing their messages_\n_there._\n\nIt is important to note that RansomHouse have never explicitly claimed that they were the\ngroup who hacked the victims, which puts in question their status as a “ransomware group”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The screenshot was taken from our Cyber API UI._\n\nBecause of their avoidance of the topic and the lack of clear proof that they are hacking\nunknowing victims, the debate continues to roll on the deep and dark web.\n\nFor example, a user of a popular hacking forum, XSS.IS, called Snaz claims that\nRansomHouse is only a data leak site, which is pretty common these days:\n\nWhether RansomHouse is responsible for the attacks or not, it’s very important to closely\nmonitor their activities and the activity of other cybercriminal groups. A broad coverage of the\ndeep and dark web helps conduct deep actor profiling and gain relevant context to prevent\nemerging cyber threats.\n\n[hacking forumsRansomware Groups](https://webz.io/blog/tag/hacking-forums/)\n\nHagar Margolin\n\nCyber Analyst\n\n\n-----",
