A closer look revealed the malware, which we’ve dubbed “Lucifer”, is capable of](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9081)\nconducting DDoS attacks and well-equipped with all kinds of exploits against vulnerable Windows hosts. The first wave of the\ncampaign stopped on June 10, 2020. The attacker then resumed their campaign on June 11, 2020, spreading an upgraded\nversion of the malware and wreaking havoc. The sample was compiled on Thursday, June 11, 2020 10:39:47 PM UTC and\ncaught by Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall. At the time of writing, the campaign’s still ongoing.\n\nLucifer is quite powerful in its capabilities. Not only is it capable of dropping XMRig for cryptojacking Monero, it’s also capable\nof command and control (C2) operation and self-propagation through the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities and credential\nbrute-forcing. Additionally, it drops and runs EternalBlue, EternalRomance, and DoublePulsar backdoor against vulnerable\ntargets for intranet infections.\n\n[The exhaustive list of weaponized exploits includes CVE-2014-6287,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6287) [CVE-2018-1000861,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000861) [CVE-2017-10271,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-10271) ThinkPHP RCE\nvulnerabilities (CVE-2018-20062), [CVE-2018-7600,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7600) [CVE-2017-9791,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9791) [CVE-2019-9081,](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9081) [PHPStudy Backdoor RCE,](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48192) CVE-20170144, [CVE-2017-0145, and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0145) [CVE-2017-8464. These vulnerabilities have either “high” or “critical” ratings due to their trivial-to-](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8464)\nexploit nature and their tremendous impact inflicted on the victim. Once exploited, the attacker can execute arbitrary\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands on the vulnerable device. In this case, the targets are Windows hosts on both the internet and intranet, given that\nthe attacker is leveraging certutil utility in the payload for malware propagation. Fortunately, the patches for these\nvulnerabilities are readily available.\n\nWhile the vulnerabilities abused and attack tactics leveraged by this malware are nothing original, they once again deliver a\nmessage to all organizations, reminding them why it’s utterly important to keep systems up-to-date whenever possible,\neliminate weak credentials, and have a layer of defenses for assurance.\n\nAt the time of writing this blog, the XMR wallet has paid 0.493527 XMR, which converts to approximately $32 USD.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewalls can detect and block all the exploit attempts from this kind of malware family.\n\nThis blog includes a detailed analysis of Lucifer and the comparison of version 1 and version 2.\n\n**Lucifer: Cryptojacking and DDoS Campaign**\n\nA quick note on the name: While the malware author named their malware Satan DDoS, there’s another malware, Satan\nRansomware, bearing that devious name already. An alternative alias was given to this malware to avoid confusion. As a\nresult of staying faithful to the unique strings in the binary, we are calling this Lucifer.\n\nWe identified two versions of Lucifer in our research - we focus first on version 1 and then highlight the changes made to\nversion 2 in the following section.\n\nLucifer contains three resource sections, each of which contains a binary for a specific purpose. The X86 resource section\ncontains a UPX-packed x86 version of XMRig 5.5.0. The X64 resource section contains a UPX-packed x64 version of XMRig\n5.5.0. The SMB section contains a binary, in which there’s a lot of Equation Group’s exploits like EternalBlue and\nEternalRomance, and of course the infamous DoublePulsar backdoor implant.\n\nX86: 8edbcd63def33827bfd63bffce4a15ba83e88908f9ac9962f10431f571ba07a8\n\nX64: Ac530d542a755ecce6a656ea6309717ec222c34d7e34c61792f3b350a8a29301\n\nSMB: 5214f356f2e8640230e93a95633cd73945c38027b23e76bb5e617c71949f8994\n\nUpon execution, the malware first decrypts its C2 IP address using a xor-incremental encryption and then creates a mutant,\nusing its C2 IP address as the mutant’s name.\n\nThe decrypted C2 IP address is 122[.]112[.]179[.]189.\n\nThe name of the mutant object is \\Sessions\\1\\BaseNamedObjects\\122[.]112[.]179[.]189\n\nThe pseudo-code for the decryption algorithm is shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 1. Decryption routine\n\nThe malware then proceeds to persist itself by setting the following registry key values.\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\QQMusic - %malware binary path%\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\QQMusic - %malware binary path%\n\n\n-----\n\nThe binary also uses schtasks to set up itself as a task running periodically, ensuring additional layer of persistence. The\ncommand executed is shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Execution of schtasks\n\nOnce the malware has persisted itself, it then checks whether there’s any existing stratum mining information stored in the\nfollowing registry key value:\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\spreadCpuXmr - %stratum info%\n\nThe mining information stored in this registry key value takes precedence if the data is present and legit. Otherwise, the\nmalware falls back to its default data embedded in the binary.\n\nThe malware enables itself with debug privilege and starts several threads to carry out its operation in concurrent fashion.\nThe following table summarizes the function of each thread.\n\n\n**Function**\n**Address**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n0x0041C970 Clear event logs, remove a log file, terminate the miner process, and repeat its cleaning routine every\n18000 second.\n\n0x00414B60 Collect interface info and send miner status to its C2 server.\n\n0x00419BC0 Check the remote address and remote port of all TCP connections. If there’s a match and the connectionowning process is not the malware itself and the process’s module path is not\nC:\\ProgramData\\spreadXfghij.exe, the malware kills that process and deletes that file. The allow list of ports\nand IP address are in the Appendix.\n\n0x0041A780 Get or initialize its miner parameter, kill miner and Taskmgr process if necessary, drop the miner binary, and\nexecute the miner binary with the values of the arguments based on the host’s memory usage. Both the x86\nor x64 bit version of the miner is saved as C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\spreadXfghij.exe\n\n0x00418DC0 Propagate through brute-forcing credentials and exploitation. Also drop the Equation Group’s exploits and\nlaunch them to propagate through exploiting years old SMB vulnerabilities.\n\n0x0041C840 Copy and save the malware as C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\spread.txt\n\n_Table 1. Worker Thread Description_\n\nThe malware employs different propagation strategies.\n\nThe malware scans for both open TCP ports 135 (RPC) and 1433(MSSQL) against the target, be it internal or external, and\nprobes for the credential weakness in attempt to gain unauthorized access.\n\nIf the target has the RPC port open, the malware brute-forces the login using the default username administrator and its\nembedded password list. It then copies and runs the malware binary on the remote host upon successful authentication.\n\nWhen the malware detects that the target has TCP port 1433 open, it tries to brute-force its way in using its embedded list of\nusernames and passwords. Upon successful login, the malware then issues shell commands to download and execute a\nreplica of itself on the victim. The aforementioned list of usernames and passwords can be found in the appendix section.\n\nIn addition to brute-forcing the credentials, the malware leverages exploitation for self-propagation. For intranet infection, it\ndrops and runs EternalBlue, EternalRomance, and DoublePulsar backdoor against the target when the target has TCP port\n445 (SMB) open. Upon successful exploitation, certutil is used to propagate the malware.\n\nThe following figures show the parameters passed to launch the exploits and the backdoor implant.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. EternalBlue and DoublePulsar\n\ncombo (for non-XP targets) Figure 4.\n\nEternalBlue and DoublePulsar combo (for XP targets)\n\nFigure 5. EternalRomance and\n\nDoublePulsar combo (all targets)\nIn order to infect external hosts, the malware first generates a non-private IP address, and then probes this randomlyselected victim with HTTP requests over a number of ports. The list of ports is available in the Appendix. When the malware\nreceives a valid HTTP response from the victim, it then tries to exploit the target based on the conditions shown in the\nfollowing table.\n\n**Condition** **Exploit**\n\nHFS found in the HTTP response CVE-2014-6287\n\nJetty found in the HTTP response CVE-2018-1000861\n\nServlet found in the HTTP response CVE-2017-10271\n\nNo keywords found in the HTTP response ThinkPHP remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities\nCVE-2018-7600\n\nCVE-2017-9791\n\nCVE-2019-9081\n\nPHPStudy Backdoor remote code execution (RCE)\n\n_Table 2. Exploit conditions and CVEs_\n\nSince the same vulnerability (e.g ThinkPHP RCE) may be triggered in different endpoints (i.e via different URLs), the malware\ntries all hardcoded URLs against the victim for each vulnerability before it proceeds to the next target or next exploit attempt.\n\nAll the exploits contain the payload that downloads a replica of the malware onto the victim via certutil. The following figures\nshow examples of the attack traffic.\n\nFigure 6. CVE-2019-9081 traffic\n\nFigure 7. ThinkPHP RCE traffic\n\nAfter the malware has launched all its worker threads, the malware enters an infinite loop to handle its C2 operation, with a\nsleep interval of five seconds.\n\nAn example of the initial request to its C2 server is shown in Figure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Initial request to C2 server\n\nOnce the malware has established a TCP connection with its C2 server on port 15888, the malware saves that same socket\nfor subsequent C2 control as well as the miner’s status report.\n\nThe initial C2 request contains a magic header \\x04\\x02\\x02 and encrypted system information like the host IP address, the\nsystem type, system architecture, username, number of processors, and processor frequency. The malware does a\ndecremental-xor encryption on this piece of information before it sends the encrypted data over the wire. The encrypted data\ncan be decrypted using the decryption routine described in Figure 1. For example, the decrypted host IP address in Figure 8\nis 192.168.56[.]52. The decrypted Windows system is Windows 7 64Bit, and the decrypted username is Lebron James.\n\nUnlike its very first C2 request message, the rest of the miner’s status report messages are actually clear text. An example\npacket of the miner’s status report is shown in Figure 9 below.\n\nFigure 9. Miner’s status report sent to\n\nC2 Server\nTable 3 summarizes the control codes received from the C2 server and their corresponding functionalities.\n\n\n**C2**\n**Command**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n4 Perform TCP/UDP/HTTP DoS attack.\n\n5 Reenable DoS attack.\n\n6 Download and execute a file from its C2 server. The file’s saved as %TEMP%\\<4 random lower case\ncharacters>.exe\n\n7 Execute the received command from its C2 server.\n\n8 Disable the miner’s status report functionality.\n\n9 Enable the miner’s status report functionality.\n\n10 Set the data of the registry key value HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\spreadCpuXmr,\nand terminate the miner process.\n\n11 Enable both flags related to is_miner_killed and start_fresh\n\n12 Reset flags and terminate the miner process.\n\n_Table 3. C2 description_\n\nThe communication between the cryptojacking bot and its mining server is made by using the Stratum protocol on port 10001\nand is controlled by the execution of the spreadXfghij.exe program. This program accepts different parameters that control\nconfiguration settings of the running miner such as username, password, CPU usage, priority, threads, and [algorithm names](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/blob/master/doc/ALGORITHMS.md)\nrespectively.\n\nFigure 10. XMRig Command-Line\n\nparameters\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Stratum protocol is mainly used by miner software to connect to a centralized server, which coordinates the workload\nbetween the clients. This protocol satisfies the requirements of the JSON RPC 2.0 specification. The JSON-RPC requests\nand responses can be seen in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Lucifer bot exchanging the\n\nmining information.\n\n**Lucifer: Version 2**\n\nVersion 2 of Lucifer is similar to its predecessor in terms of its overall capabilities and behaviors; It drops XMRig for\ncryptojacking, handles C2 operation, and propagates itself through exploitation and brute-forcing credentials.\n\nWhile version 2 and version 1 share a lot of behavioral similarities, version 2 does have exclusive differences that are worth\nhighlighting.\n\nThe malware possesses anti-sandbox capability by checking the username and the computer name of the infected host. If it\nfinds a match in its predefined list of names as shown in Table 4, the malware halts itself from proceeding further.\n\nNMSDBOX Avira\n\nWILBERT-SC COMPUTERNAME\n\nXPAMASTC CWSX\n\nKappa VBOX\n\nXXXX-OS cuckoo\n\ncwsx- nmsdbox\n\nqemu sandbox\n\nvirtual wilbert-sc\n\nxpamast-sc xxxx - ox\n\ncuckoosandbox\n\n_Table 4. List of Names_\n\nLucifer also checks for the presence of following device drivers, DLLs, and virtual devices. If any of these objects are\ndetected, the malware enters an infinite loop, stopping its execution from going further.\n\nSbieDrv.sys Sandboxie.sys\n\nSbieDll.dll VBoxHook.dll\n\n\\\\.\\VBoxMiniRdrDN Dir_watch.dll\n\n\\\\.\\pipe\\cuckoo\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 5. List of Driver Names_\n\nIn addition to its anti-sandbox techniques, version 2 possesses an anti-debugger technique that can thwart the analysis by\npassing a format string to OutputDebugStringA() and crashing the debugger.\n\nOnce Lucifer has passed all the checks, it decrypts its C2 URL and creates a mutex based on its C2 URL. The new C2 URL\nis qf2020[.]top, and the decryption algorithm is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThere’s an additional LNK resource section, in which there’s a CVE-2017-8464 exploit used for infection. The binaries in the\nresource section are encrypted using the aforementioned xor-incremental encryption. The decrypted X86, X64, and SMB\nbinaries are the same as those embedded in version 1 of Lucifer.\n\nLNK (encrypted): 84b0f2e4d222b0a2e34224e60b66340071e0d03c5f1a2af53b6005a3d739915f\n\nLNK (decrypted): 4c729b343ed3186dffdf80a8e3adfea7c2d56a7a06081333030fb4635e09d540\n\nSMB (encrypted): F2d9d7703a5983ae3b7767c33ae79de1db093ea30f97d6b16bb5b62f03e99638\n\nSMB (decrypted): 5214f356f2e8640230e93a95633cd73945c38027b23e76bb5e617c71949f8994\n\nX64 (encrypted): 4365c2ba5505afeab2c479a9c546ed3cbc07ace184fe5019947823018feb4265\n\nX64 (decrypted): ac530d542a755ecce6a656ea6309717ec222c34d7e34c61792f3b350a8a29301\n\nX86 (encrypted): b6d4b4ef2880238dc8e322c7438f57b69cec6d44c0599875466a1edb8d093e15\n\nX86 (decrypted): 8edbcd63def33827bfd63bffce4a15ba83e88908f9ac9962f10431f571ba07a8\n\nIn contrast to version 1, version 2 of Lucifer has added CVE-2017-8464 to its arsenal and taken out CVE-2018-1000861,\nCVE-2017-10271, and CVE-2017-9791.\n\nThe malware infects its targets through IPC, WMI, SMB, and FTP by brute-forcing the credentials, in addition to MSSQL,\nRPC, and network shares.\n\nThe dropped miner’s name is also different; it’s C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Svchocpu.exe instead of\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\spreadXfghij.exe.\n\nRight before proceeding to its C2 operation, Lucifer checks if the host's default language is 0x804 (zh-CN). If it is, the\nmalware sets Internet Explorer's Start Page to www[.]yzzswt[.]com, and starts a thread that keeps killing and visiting that URL\nin Internet Explorer. The trigger depends on the system's idle time.\n\nWhile Lucifer version 2 has new C2 at qf2020[.]top:19370, its C2 operation is still the same.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLucifer is a new hybrid of cryptojacking and DDoS malware variant that leverages old vulnerabilities to spread and perform\nmalicious activities on Windows platforms. Applying the updates and patches to the affected software are strongly advised.\nThe vulnerable software includes Rejetto HTTP File Server, Jenkins, Oracle Weblogic, Drupal, Apache Struts, Laravel\nframework, and Microsoft Windows.
