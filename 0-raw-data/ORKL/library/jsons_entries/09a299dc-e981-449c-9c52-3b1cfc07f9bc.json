The group’s espionage campaigns have targeted healthcare, telecoms, and the high-tech sector, and have historically included stealing intellectual property. Their cyber crime intrusions are most apparent among video game industry targeting, including the manipulation of virtual currencies, and attempted deployment of ransomware. APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.\n Overview: APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state- Image source: fireeye.com sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state control.\n\n Associated malware: CROSSWALK, HIGHNOON, xDoor, Xmrig, ASPXSpy, China Chopper, BEACON, MESSAGETAP, Gh0st, njRAT, PlugX, ZxShell, Mimikatz, and BLACKCOFFEE, POISONPLUG\n\n Attack vectors: APT41 often relies on spear-phishing emails with attachments such as compiled HTML (.chm) files to initially compromise their victims. Once in a victim organization, APT41 can leverage more sophisticated TTPs and deploy additional malware. For example, in a campaign running almost a year, APT41 compromised hundreds of systems and used close to 150 unique pieces of malware including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits. APT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT41 Wanted Poster (September 2020)\nImage source: FBI\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT24\n\n Also known as: PittyTiger\n\n Suspected attribution: China\n\n Target sectors: APT24 has targeted a wide variety of industries, including organizations in the healthcare, government, construction and engineering, mining, nonprofit, and telecommunications industries.\n\n Overview: This group is known to have targeted organizations headquartered in countries including the U.S. and Taiwan usually for the goal of intellectual property theft. APT24 has Image source: fireeye.com historically used the RAR archive utility to encrypt and compress stolen data prior to transferring it out of the network. Data theft exfiltrated from this actor mainly focused on documents with political significance, suggesting its intent is to monitor the positions of various nation states on issues applicable to China’s ongoing territorial or sovereignty dispute.\n\n Associated malware: PITTYTIGER, Mimikatz, ENFAL, TAIDOOR, Gh0st RAT, PoisonIvy\n\n Attack vectors: APT24 has used phishing emails that use military, renewable energy, or business strategy themes as lures. PittyTiger also attempts to obtain legitimate credentials during operations (T1078) and has leveraged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office products.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT22\n\n Also known as: Barista\n\n Suspected attribution: China\n\n Target sectors: Healthcare, biomedical, and pharmaceutical as well as a broad set of political, military, and economic entities in East Asia, Europe, and the U.S.\n\n Overview: APT22 likely has a nexus to China and has been operational since at least early 2014, carrying out intrusions and attack activity against public and private sector entities, Image source: fireeye.com including dissidents. Conducted multi-year targeting of health center focused on cancer research.\n\n Associated malware: PISCES, SOGU (AKA PlugX), FLATNOTE, ANGRYBELL, BASELESS, SEAWOLF, LOGJAM\n\n Attack vectors: APT22 threat actors have used strategic web compromises in order to passively exploit targets of interest. APT22 actors have also identified vulnerable public-facing web servers on victim networks and uploaded web shells to gain access to the victim network.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT20\n\n Also known as: Twivy\n\n Suspected attribution: China\n\n Target sectors: Healthcare, construction and engineering, non-profit organizations, defense industrial base and chemical research and production companies, MSPs\n\n Overview: APT20 engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft. APT20 conducts intellectual property theft but also appears interested in stealing data from or Image source: fireeye.com monitoring the activities of individuals with particular political interests. Based on available data, this is likely a freelancer group with some nation state sponsorship located in China.\n\n Associated malware: QIAC, SOGU (AKA DestroyRAT, PlugX, Korplug), Gh0st RAT, ZXSHELL, Poison Ivy, BEACON (Cobalt Strike), HOMEUNIX, STEW\n\n Attack vectors: APT20 has exploited vulnerabilities in Jboss web servers using ‘living off the land’ techniques and succeeded in moving laterally throughout network to compromise systems and dump passwords of admin accounts. The group has also successfully bypassed two- factor authentication (2FA) on VPN accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT18\n\n Also known as: Wekby, TG-0416, Dynamite Panda\n\n Suspected attribution: China\n\n Target sectors: Health and Biotechnology, Aerospace and Defense, Construction and Engineering, Education, High Tech, Telecommunications, Transportation\n\n Overview: Very little has been released publicly about this group but APT18 is believed to be responsible for the 2014 attack on Community Health Systems Inc. which resulted in theft of SSNs Image source: fireeye.com and PII for 4.5 million patients.\n\n Associated malware: Gh0st RAT, HTTPBrowser, pisloader, PoisonIvy\n\n Attack vectors: Frequently developed or adapted zero-day exploits for operations, which were likely planned in advance. Used data from Hacking Team leak, which demonstrated how the group can shift resources (i.e. selecting targets, preparing infrastructure, crafting messages, updating tools) to take advantage of unexpected opportunities like newly exposed exploits. APT18 previously exploited the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability in 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT10\n\n Also known as: Menupass Team, Stone Panda, Red Apollo, Cicada, CVNX, HOGFISH, Cloud Hopper\n\n Suspected attribution: China\n\n Target sectors: Healthcare, construction and engineering, aerospace, and telecom firms, and governments in the United States, Europe, and Japan\n\n Overview: APT10 is a Chinese cyber espionage group tracked since 2009. Researchers believe that the targeting of these industries has been in support of Image source: fireeye.com Chinese national security goals, including acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of confidential business data to support Chinese corporations.\n\n Associated malware: HAYMAKER AKA ChChes AKA Scorpion, SNUGRIDE, BUGJUICE AKA RedLeaves (overlap with PlugX), QUASARRAT AKA xRAT\n\n Attack vectors: Traditional spear phishing and access to victim’s networks through managed service providers (MSPs). APT10 spear phishes have been relatively unsophisticated, leveraging .lnk files within archives, files with double extensions. APT10 has successfully remained undetected in victim environments for up to a year. The group has been seen leveraging ‘living off the land’ techniques, DLL-side-loading and custom DLL loaders, ZeroLogon vulnerability, RAR archiving, certutil, adfind, csvde, ntdsutil, WMIExec, and PowerShell as well as using legitimate cloud file hosting services for exfiltration.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT9\n\n Also known as: Nightshade Panda\n\n Suspected attribution: Based on available data, we assess that this is a freelancer group with some nation-state sponsorship, possibly China.\n\n Target sectors: Organizations headquartered in multiple countries and in industries such as health care and pharmaceuticals, construction and engineering, and aerospace and defense.\n\n Overview: APT9 engages in cyber operations where the goal is data theft, usually focusing on the data and projects that make a Image source: fireeye.com particular organization competitive within its field.\n\n Associated malware: SOGU (AKA DestroyRAT, PlugX, Korplug), HOMEUNIX, PHOTO (AKA Derusbi), FUNRUN, Gh0st, ZXSHEL\n\n Attack vectors: APT9 was historically very active in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry. Researchers observed this actor use spearphishing, valid accounts, as well as remote services for Initial Access. On at least one occasion, analysts observed APT9 at two companies in the biotechnology industry and suspect that APT9 actors may have gained initial access to one of the companies by using a trusted relationship between the two companies. APT9 use a wide range of backdoors, including publicly available backdoors, as well as backdoors that are believed to be custom, but are used by multiple APT groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Also known as: Comment Crew, TG-8223, Group 3, Byzantine Candor\n\n Suspected attribution: China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department’s 3rd Department, Unit 61398\n\n Target sectors: Healthcare, Information Technology, Scientific Research and Consulting, International Organizations, Food and Agriculture, Education, and many more\n\n Overview: APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations, and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously.
