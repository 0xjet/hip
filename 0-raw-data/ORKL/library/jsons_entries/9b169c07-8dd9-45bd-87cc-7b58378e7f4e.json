The National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 (NCPA) established NCCIC in law. Together, NCPA and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 collectively tasked NCCIC with a number of core cybersecurity functions, including serving as a federal-civilian interface for sharing cyber threat indicators, coordinating information exchange across the Federal Government, and providing information and recommendations on security and resilience measures to federal and non-federal entities.\n\n Q: What does NCCIC do? Q: How does NCCIC protect the public and private sectors\n from cybersecurity and communications threats?\n\nNCCIC helps people and organizations defend their cyber\n\n\nWorking with our partners, we used our telecommunications\ncapabilities to respond to major hurricanes, wildfires, and\nother natural disasters. We streamlined our cyber assessment\nand analytic teams to better enable network defenders to\nidentify—and reduce the risk of—malicious attacks. We built\nout our vulnerability management capabilities to ensure\nresponsible disclosure of IT and OT vulnerabilities and to provide\ncorresponding research and analysis. We continued to develop\nand expand our capacity to respond to incidents, and we stood\nup a new cyber hunt capability that significantly improves our\nability to proactively find threat actors on government and\nCI networks.\n\n###### Q: How is NCCIC evolving?\n\nOur evolution is an ongoing process. We continuously look for\nways to create a more nimble organization that can quickly\nadapt to the changing threat environment and deliver critical\nproducts and services to our stakeholders with greater speed,\n\n\nvalue, and proficiency. We are just getting started, and the\nchanges we are making are streamlining NCCIC operations,\nand improving analytical insight, information sharing, and\nresponse synchronization. As part of an internal realignment,\nwe are organizing to more effectively deliver the products and\nservices our stakeholders rely upon. We are bringing focus\nto cooperative efforts across the Office of Cybersecurity and\nCommunications[3] (CS&C) to deliver a wide range of cyber and\ncommunications support functions.\n\nTo succeed in an ever-changing cyber and communications\nenvironment, we recognize that we must do an extraordinary\njob. We must always strive to be more effective in everything we\ndo. We will continue to listen to our partners and stakeholders,\nlearn from the evolving landscape, and adapt our operations\nand tools to be a step ahead of cyber threat actors.\n\n\n###### CHEMICAL\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n###### COMMERCIAL FACILITIES\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n###### COMMUNICATIONS\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n###### CRITICAL  MANUFACTURING\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n###### DAMS\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n###### DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n\n\nWe enhance the security of the cyber and communications\necosystem through threat information sharing across the globe.\nIf reliable information flows quickly and to enough people, we\ncan halt cyber incidents before they spread widely and cause\nsignificant harm. On our 24/7 watch floor, we continuously\nmonitor national and international incidents and events that\nmay affect cyber and communications infrastructure. By fusing\ninformation from all levels of government, the private sector,\ninternational partners, and the public, we help people and\norganizations take action to protect against cybersecurity risks.\nThis coordination also improves government-wide incident and\nemergency response capabilities and strengthens resilience.\n\nNCCIC’s priority is delivering products and services to protect\nthe networks and systems that underpin our Nation’s critical\ninfrastructure (CI). CI includes essential government services,\nfinancial institutions, energy providers, transportation systems,\nwater treatment systems, public health, chemical and nuclear\nplants, and emergency services (table 1 shows the 16\nidentified CI sectors). At the same time, we make many of\nNCCIC’s products and services available at no cost to all\nAmericans to use to protect themselves from cyber threats.\n\n\nIntegration is one of our core functions. Many of our\npartners—including members of the intelligence community,\nlaw enforcement, and major Internet service providers—are\nco-located on our watch floor, which facilitates coordination and\ncollaboration. We exchange information with these partners,\nanalyze data, and provide results in publicly available alerts,\ntechnical advisories, and reports.\n\nWe also help stakeholders improve cyber hygiene, assess\ncybersecurity posture, test network defenses, and enhance\npreparedness and expertise through exercises and training.\nAdditionally, when major incidents occur, the NCCIC team\nprovides both remote and on-site incident response support\nto federal departments and agencies; state, local, tribal, and\nterritorial (SLTT) governments; and the private sector.\n\n###### Q: What did NCCIC accomplish in Fiscal Year 2017?\n\nAs you will read throughout this report, NCCIC continued\nto operate at a high tempo in Fiscal Year 2017 (FY17). We\nresponded to diverse incidents, conducted exercises to support\noperational readiness, and provided guidance on advanced\npersistent threat (APT) campaigns, including GRIZZLY STEPPE,\nDragonfly, and HIDDEN COBRA.[2] In FY17, NCCIC also responded\nto malware implants on critical systems, including IT service\nproviders, where an attacker could exploit credential\ncompromises to gain access to customer network environments.\n\n\n###### Presidential Policy  Directive 21: Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience\n\n\n1 Presidential Policy Directive-21: Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, establishes national policy on CI security\nand resilience. PPD-21 defines CI as systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that\ntheir incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public\nhealth or safety, or any combination of those matters. PPD-21 identifies 16 CI sectors and designates associated Federal\nSector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) to lead Federal Government efforts to collaborate, coordinate, and implement actions to\n\n\n###### EMERGENCY SERVICES\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n###### ENERGY\nDEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\n\n###### FINANCIAL SERVICES\nDEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n###### FOOD AND AGRICULTURE\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND\nHUMAN SERVICES\n\n###### GOVERNMENT FACILITIES\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,\nGENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n###### Designated Critical  Infrastructure (CI) Sectors[1]\n\n HEALTHCARE AND  PUBLIC HEALTH\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND\nHUMAN SERVICES\n\n###### INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n###### NUCLEAR REACTORS,  MATERIALS, AND WASTE\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n###### TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,\nDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\n\n###### WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n\n\n2 GRIZZLY STEPPE, Dragonfly, and HIDDEN COBRA are separate APT campaigns.

We are committed to dialogue and engagement at all levels, whether it is operational coordination on the NCCIC watch floor, analyst-to-analyst exchanges, participation in industry events and global forums, or leading national- level cyber exercises. Trust within the community of cyber and communications stakeholders is essential to this collective defense strategy. NCCIC builds trust by:\n\n • embedding confidentiality, privacy, and civil liberties protections into our information sharing culture;\n\n • demonstrating our technical competence; and\n\n • listening and responding to stakeholder needs.\n\n NCCIC’s primary stakeholders—customers, constituents, and partners—include the Federal Government; SLTT governments; private sector businesses (particularly those that manage critical infrastructure); the research and academic community; the public; and our international allies. Going forward, we will focus on new ways of adding value to our partnerships, and expanding the community of contributors to the global cyber and communications security mission.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS  AND AGENCIES\n\nFederal network defense is a coordinated\neffort, and NCCIC collaborates closely\nwith its constituent departments and\nagencies to help them take action to\nmitigate cyber risk.\n\n\ncollaboration with departments and\nagencies.[4 ] W e provide situational awareness and advice to DHS leadership and\nsenior government officials, Congress,\nand the National Security Council.\n\nNCCIC also plays a key role in the\nContinuity Communications Manager’s\nGroup (CCMG) forum. Meeting every\nquarter, CCMG provides a critical forum\nfor information sharing and coordination\namong continuity communications\nmanagers to address issues, challenges,\nopportunities, new technologies, and\nsolutions. CCMG also addresses matters\nrelated to policy, planning, operations,\ntesting, evaluation, and systems\ninteroperability affecting the executive\nbranch continuity communications\nenvironment. It is also an important\nforum to review and address continuity\ncommunications test results, trends,\ncompliance assessment reports, and\nlong-term communications challenges.\n\n\npartners. NCCIC needs private sector\ninformation, innovation, technical expertise, and active engagement to successfully carry out our mission. Additionally,\nour adversaries frequently target private\nsector CI organizations due to the degree\nto which society relies on the goods and\nservices they provide. Because of this,\nprivate sector CI owners and operators are\nmajor consumers of NCCIC products, as\nwell as essential partners.\n\n\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS\nINFORMATION SHARING\n\nAs part of our robust cyber collaboration with the private sector,\nwe maintain close coordination with the telecommunications\nindustry. In particular, NCCIC’s National Coordinating Center\nfor Communications (NCC) manages the Communications\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (Comms-ISAC) to share\nand apply the technical expertise, threat awareness, and operational\ncapabilities required to address hazards and risks to the Nation’s\ntelecommunications infrastructure. We maintain integrated\noperational relationships—physically and virtually—with\ncommunications service providers and other stakeholders to get\nreal-time operating status and to coordinate assistance during\nan incident.\n\n\n###### Supporting Our Election Infrastructure\n\nNCCIC was a critical contributor to a DHS initiative to ensure the\nintegrity of the Nation’s EI in preparation for the November 2016\ngeneral election. The purpose of the initiative was to raise\nawareness of cybersecurity vulnerabilities within voting infrastructure\nand increase the security and resilience of the electoral process.\n\n\n4 Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-41, United States Cyber Incident Coordination, outlines the roles federal agencies play during a significant cyber incident. DHS plays a major role in both\nasset response and threat response. DHS is the lead agency for asset response during a significant cyber incident, focusing on the assets of the victim or potential targets of malicious\nactivity In fulfilling this responsibility NCCIC assists asset owners in mitigating vulnerabilities identifies other entities that may be at risk and shares information across the public and\n\n\n5 Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) seek to expand information sharing by encouraging the formation of communities that share information across a region or in\nresponse to a specific emerging cyber threat Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are essential drivers of effective cybersecurity collaboration for specific industrial sectors\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTERNATIONAL  PARTNERS\n\nCyber threats are borderless and ubiquitous. Attacks in distant parts of\nthe world may replicate quickly and cause cascading consequences for\nour own cyber and communications infrastructure.\n\nNCCIC is a leader in the global fight for secure cyber and communications\nnetworks, and brings together a broad range of international partners\nin a common effort to strengthen our capacity to fight threats. Through\nthis work, we improve the cyber and communications risk posture of the\nUnited States.\n\nStrengthening operational collaboration with international counterparts\nenables us to prepare for, prevent, mitigate, and respond to incidents\nthat could degrade or overwhelm cyber and communications assets.\nOperational relationships among nations play a significant role in\nensuring the safety and resilience of cyberspace. We know that our ability\nto respond to and overcome global cyber challenges improves in part by\nthe degree to which we can act in close coordination and cooperation.\n\nIn close coordination with the State Department, NCCIC collaborates with\ninternational partners to build situational awareness, reduce risk, and\ncoordinate information sharing and international response to incidents.\nWe coordinate with our global peers in a number of areas, including\n\n - exchange of technical expertise,\n\n - threat intelligence sharing,\n\n - establishing security standards,\n\n - industrial control systems security, and\n\n - cyber and communications capacity building.\n\nWe also participate in a range of multilateral and multi-stakeholder fora,\nincluding the following:\n\n - Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation;\n\n - Organization of American States;\n\n - Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development;\n\n - North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);\n\n - Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe;\n\n - International Telecommunications Union Development Sector, Forum\nof Incident Response and Security Teams;\n\n - Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team; and\n\n - Meridian Process and Conference.\n\n\n###### Fighting WannaCry Ransomware:  A Sustained Global Effort\n\nThe May 2017 global WannaCry ransomware campaign\nhighlights continued attempts by malicious actors to\nleverage cyberspace to disrupt international CI and cause\neconomic loss. It is also an excellent example of how,\ntogether with our global partners, NCCIC can help fight\nsuch attacks and minimize their impact.\n\nWannaCry began in Asia on May 12, 2017, and rapidly\nspread across the world—sources reported hundreds of\nthousands of infections in over 150 countries in just days.\nDue in part to the coordinated and sustained counteraction\nby NCCIC and its domestic and foreign partners, WannaCry\nhad limited impact on U.S. CI.\n\nWannaCry exploited a critical Windows Server Message\nBlock vulnerability to remotely compromise victim\nsystems, encrypt files, and spread to other hosts. Attackers\ndemanded money to unencrypt the affected files.\n\nAs soon as WannaCry sightings were reported, NCCIC\nproactively began sharing information and coordinating\nwith its international partners to understand and mitigate\nthe impacts of the malware. NCCIC also worked with\ndomestic security experts and researchers, and other\nfederal departments and agencies. NCCIC’s response\nincluded\n\n- quickly sharing information that identified the\nvulnerability WannaCry exploited;\n\n- conducting analysis on malware samples;\n\n- issuing technical alerts identifying the indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs);\n\n- sharing the identified IOCs through AIS and the\nCybersecurity Information Sharing and Collaboration\nProgram (CISCP); and\n\n- deploying signatures on EINSTEIN to protect federal\nnetworks.\n\nNCCIC coordinated with more than 40 IT and cybersecurity\ncompanies (including major Internet service providers) to\nconvey what we knew.\n\nAs part of its mission to protect federal departments and\nagencies, NCCIC also led Cybersecurity Coordination,\nAssessment, and Response (C-CAR) meetings to share\nactionable information about the threats.

The watch floor disseminates this\ninformation to NCCIC analysts for resolution and—as quickly as\npossible—shares alerts, reports, and other information products\nback to the community, so that our customers and partners can\ntake action.\n\nA diverse set of information sources is vital to developing a\nbig-picture perspective of the Nation’s systemic cyber and\ncommunications risk. In turn, this overarching view helps us\n“connect the dots,” so that we can quickly identify and help our\ncustomers mitigate threats and respond to incidents.\n\nOperating in two physical locations—Arlington, VA, and\nPensacola, FL—the watch floor provides shared national-level\nsituational awareness and a forum for real-time operational\ncollaboration with NCCIC’s many partners. Our Arlington\noperations are co-located with the National Infrastructure\nCoordinating Center (NICC)[6] to ensure coordinated and\nconsistent information exchange with our customers for both\nphysical and cyber threats.\n\n\n###### EXPANDING OUR INFORMATION  SHARING CAPABILITIES\n\n\n6 NICC is the dedicated 24/7 coordination and information sharing operations center that maintains situational awareness of the Nation’s critical infrastructure for the Federal Government.\n\n###### BUILDING UNDERSTANDING  AND AWARENESS  OF SYSTEMIC RISK\n\nAs attacks on our cyber and communications infrastructure\ngrow in diversity, prevalence, and sophistication, NCCIC’s\nmission demands that we stay ahead of the threat curve.

Together, this interagency team\n\n - ensured communications were available to impacted communities and responders;\n\n - supported planning, including the development of a public safety recovery plan and\nintegrated power-communications restoration plans; and\n\n - acted as translators, radio operators, logisticians, and imagery analysts.\n\nThe team’s efforts supported the issuance of two communications-related executive orders\nin Puerto Rico, which enabled expedited communications restoration and waived taxes for\ncommunications equipment temporarily imported to restore communications. NCCIC also\nled the ESF in developing a plan to restore public safety land mobile radio communications\nin Puerto Rico. To improve customer connectivity, the interagency team leveraged partnerships in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to increase roaming agreements.\n\nAs the national coordinator for ESF #2, NCCIC led efforts with industry partners in each of\nthe affected states and territories to share resources and information to improve the ability\nof the Communications Sector to provide service to affected areas.\n\nIn the wake of each disaster, NCCIC and its partners joined in efforts to restore critical\ncommunications by helping to prioritize and resolve issues related to fuel, transportation,\nand access. NCCIC also helped forge an agreement—among carriers, tower owners, site\nowners, debris removal and road clearance teams, tower climbers, generator technicians,\nand fuel suppliers—to expedite site repair through prioritization and collaboration.\n\nNCC also provided extensive analytical support to affected areas. This included\n\n - over 100 telecommunications infrastructure analysis reports before and after\nhurricanes;\n\n - coordination of the expedited delivery of 30,000 phone numbers needed to put\nreplacement phones into service on the U.S. Virgin Islands, shrinking a multi-week\nprocess to days;\n\n - deployment of more than 80 staff to assist affected areas in Florida, Georgia, Puerto\nRico, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and FEMA Headquarters;\n\n - daily reports and graphics providing overall telecommunications landline and cellular\nnetworks statistics for the affected areas;\n\n - maps projecting cellular coverage of Puerto Rico at least three times a week, in\ncoordination with the telecommunications carriers; and\n\n - continuous updates to maps, identifying the availability and location of ancillary\ncellular equipment (such as hotspots, cell on wheels, and cell on light trucks).\n\nNCCIC continues to work with its government and industry partners to prepare for\ncommunications disruptions through coordinated planning, exercises, and training.\n\n8 ESF #2 is the Communications Annex to the National Response Framework (https://www.fema.gov/media-library/\nassets/documents/117791).
