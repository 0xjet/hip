Generating a Monthly Domain name (all of which are controlled by Talos for 2017)\n\n2.

The true destination IP is then computed and connected to.\n\nTo control the connections Talos has to create two IPs such that they can be fed into\nthe application to resolve to the sinkhole IP.\n\n32 bits of random data were generated. 16 bits of that were combined with 16 bits of\nthe destination address to create the first A record. The remaining 16 random bits were\ncombined with the remaining bits of the destination address to create the second A\nrecord.\n\nThe resulting two A record IP addresses were then assigned to the DNS configuration.\n\nThere was no analysis performed on the selected addresses beyond that they could be\ncombined to create the destination.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Update 9/20: Continued research on C2 and payloads can be found here:_\n[http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/ccleaner-c2-concern.html](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/09/ccleaner-c2-concern.html)\n\n## Introduction\n\nSupply chain attacks are a very effective way to distribute malicious software into target\norganizations. This is because with supply chain attacks, the attackers are relying on the\ntrust relationship between a manufacturer or supplier and a customer. This trust relationship\nis then abused to attack organizations and individuals and may be performed for a number of\ndifferent reasons. The Nyetya [worm that was released into the wild earlier in 2017 showed](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/the-medoc-connection.html)\njust how potent these types of attacks can be. Frequently, as with Nyetya, the initial infection\nvector can remain elusive for quite some time. Luckily with tools like AMP the additional\nvisibility can usually help direct attention to the initial vector.\n\nTalos recently observed a case where the download servers used by software vendor to\ndistribute a legitimate software package were leveraged to deliver malware to unsuspecting\nvictims. For a period of time, the legitimate signed version of CCleaner 5.33 being distributed\nby [Avast also contained a multi-stage malware payload that rode on top of the installation of](https://blog.avast.com/welcome-piriform-to-avast)\n[CCleaner. CCleaner boasted over 2 billion total downloads by November of 2016 with a](https://www.piriform.com/about)\ngrowth rate of 5 million additional users per week. Given the potential damage that could be\ncaused by a network of infected computers even a tiny fraction of this size we decided to\nmove quickly. On September 13, 2017 Cisco Talos immediately notified Avast of our findings\nso that they could initiate appropriate response activities. The following sections will discuss\nthe specific details regarding this attack.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nCCleaner is an application that allows users to perform routine maintenance on their\nsystems. It includes functionality such as cleaning of temporary files, analyzing the system to\ndetermine ways in which performance can be optimized and provides a more streamlined\nway to manage installed applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Screenshot of CCleaner 5.33**\n\nOn September 13, 2017 while conducting customer beta testing of our new exploit detection\ntechnology, Cisco Talos identified a specific executable which was triggering our advanced\nmalware protection systems. Upon closer inspection, the executable in question was the\ninstaller for CCleaner v5.33, which was being delivered to endpoints by the legitimate\nCCleaner download servers. Talos began initial analysis to determine what was causing this\ntechnology to flag CCleaner. We identified that even though the downloaded installation\nexecutable was signed using a valid digital signature issued to Piriform, CCleaner was not\nthe only application that came with the download. During the installation of CCleaner 5.33,\nthe 32-bit CCleaner binary that was included also contained a malicious payload that\nfeatured a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) as well as hardcoded Command and Control\n(C2) functionality. We confirmed that this malicious version of CCleaner was being hosted\ndirectly on CCleaner's download server as recently as September 11, 2017.\n\nIn reviewing the Version History page on the CCleaner download site, it appears that the\naffected version (5.33) was released on August 15, 2017. On September 12, 2017 version\n5.34 was released. The version containing the malicious payload (5.33) was being\ndistributed between these dates. This version was signed using a valid certificate that was\n\n\n-----\n\nissued to Piriform Ltd by Symantec and is valid through 10/10/2018. Piriform was the\ncompany that Avast recently acquired and was the original company who developed the\nCCleaner software application.\n\n**Figure 2: Digital Signature of CCleaner 5.33**\n\nA second sample associated with this threat was discovered. This second sample was also\nsigned using a valid digital certificate, however the signing timestamp was approximately 15\nminutes after the initial sample was signed.\n\nThe presence of a valid digital signature on the malicious CCleaner binary may be indicative\nof a larger issue that resulted in portions of the development or signing process being\ncompromised. Ideally this certificate should be revoked and untrusted moving forward. When\n\n\n-----\n\ngenerating a new cert care must be taken to ensure attackers have no foothold within the\nenvironment with which to compromise the new certificate. Only the incident response\nprocess can provide details regarding the scope of this issue and how to best address it.\n\nInterestingly the following compilation artifact was found within the CCleaner binary that\nTalos analyzed:\n\nS:\\workspace\\ccleaner\\branches\\v5.33\\bin\\CCleaner\\Release\\CCleaner.pdb\n\nGiven the presence of this compilation artifact as well as the fact that the binary was digitally\nsigned using a valid certificate issued to the software developer, it is likely that an external\nattacker compromised a portion of their development or build environment and leveraged\nthat access to insert malware into the CCleaner build that was released and hosted by the\norganization. It is also possible that an insider with access to either the development or build\nenvironments within the organization intentionally included the malicious code or could have\nhad an account (or similar) compromised which allowed an attacker to include the code.\n\nIt is also important to note that while previous versions of the CCleaner installer are currently\nstill available on the download server, the version containing the malicious payloads has\nbeen removed and is no longer available.\n\n## Malware Installation and Operation\n\nWithin the 32-bit CCleaner v5.33 binary included with the legitimate CCleaner v5.33 installer,\n'__scrt_get_dyn_tls_init_callback' was modified to call to the code at\nCC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C). This was done to redirect code execution flow within the\nCCleaner binary to the malicious code prior to continuing with the normal CCleaner\noperations. The code that is called is responsible for decrypting data which contains the two\nstages of the malicious payload, a PIC (Position Independent Code) PE loader as well as a\nDLL file that effectively functions as the malware payload. The malware author had tried to\nreduce the detection of the malicious DLL by ensuring the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER was\nzeroed out, suggesting this attacker was trying to remain under the radar to normal detection\ntechniques.\n\nThe binary then creates an executable heap using\nHeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE,0,0). Space is then allocated to this new\nheap which is where the contents of the decrypted data containing the malware is copied. As\nthe data is copied to the heap, the source data is erased. The PE loader is then called and\nbegins its operation. Once the infection process has been initiated, the binary erases the\nmemory regions that previously contained the PE loader and the DLL file, frees the\npreviously allocated memory, destroys the heap and continues on with normal CCleaner\noperations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PE loader utilizes position independent coding practices in order to locate the DLL file\nwithin memory. It then maps the DLL into executable memory, calls the DLLEntryPoint to\nbegin execution of the DLL being loaded and the CCleaner binary continues as normal.\nOnce this occurs the malware begins its full execution, following the process outlined in the\nfollowing sections.\n\n### CBkrdr.dll\n\nThe DLL file (CBkdr.dll) was modified in an attempt to evade detection and had the\nIMAGE_DOS_HEADER zeroed out. The DLLEntryPoint creates an execution thread so that\ncontrol can be returned to the loader. This thread is responsible for calling\nCCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall. It also sets up a Return Oriented Programming\n(ROP) chain that is used to deallocate the memory associated with the DLL and exit the\nthread.\n\n### CCBkrdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall\n\nThis function is responsible for much of the malicious operations that Talos observed while\nanalyzing this malware. First, it records the current system time on the infected system. It\nthen delays for 601 seconds before continuing operations, likely an attempt to evade\nautomated analysis systems that are configured to execute samples for a predefined period\nof time or determine whether the malware is being executed in a debugger. In order to\nimplement this delay functionality, the malware calls a function which attempts to ping\n224.0.0.0 using a delay_in_seconds timeout set to 601 seconds. It then checks to determine\nthe current system time to see if 600 seconds has elapsed. If that condition is not met, the\nmalware terminates execution while the CCleaner binary continues normal operations. In\nsituations where the malware is unable to execute IcmpCreateFile, it then falls back to using\nSleep() to implement the same delay functionality. The malware also compares the current\nsystem time to the value stored in the following registry location:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Piriform\\Agomo:TCID\n\nIf the value stored in TCID is in the future, the malware will also terminate execution.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Delay Routine**\n\nThe malware then checks to determine the privileges assigned to the user running on the\nsystem. If the current user running the malicious process is not an administrator the malware\nwill terminate execution.\n\n**Figure 4: Privilege Check**\n\nIf the user executing the malware does have administrative privileges on the infected system,\nSeDebugPrivilege is enabled for the process. The malware then reads the value of 'InstallID'\nwhich is stored in the following registry location:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Piriform\\Agomo:MUID\n\nIf this value does not exist, the malware creates it using '((rand()*rand() ^ GetTickCount())'.\n\nOnce the aforementioned activities have been performed, the malware then begins profiling\nthe system and gathering system information which is later transmitted to the C2 server.\nSystem information is stored in the following data structure:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: CCBkdr_System_Information Data Structure**\n\nOnce the system information has been collected, it is encrypted and then encoded using\nmodified Base64. The malware then establishes a Command and Control (C2) channel as\ndescribed in the following section.\n\n## Command and Control (C2)\n\nWhile analyzing this malware, Talos identified what appears to be a software bug present in\nthe malicious code related to the C2 function. The sample that Talos analyzed reads a DGA\ncomputed IP address located in the following registry location, but currently does nothing\nwith it:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Piriform\\Agomo:NID\n\nIt is unknown what the purpose of this IP address is at this time, as the malware does not\nappear to make use of it during subsequent operations. In any event, once the previously\nmentioned system information has been collected and prepared for transmission to the C2\nserver, the malware will then attempt to transmit it using an HTTPS POST request to\n216[.]126[.]225[.]148. The HTTPS communications leverage a hardcoded HTTP Host header\nthat is set to speccy[.]piriform[.]com, a legitimate platform which is also created by Piriform\nfor hardware monitoring. This could make dynamic analysis more difficult as the domain\nwould appear to be legitimate and perhaps even expected depending on the victim\ninfrastructure. The requests also leverage HTTPS but ignore all security errors as the server\ncurrently returns a self-signed SSL certificate that was issued to the subdomain defined in\nthe Host header field. In cases where no response is received from the C2 server, the\nmalware then fails back to a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) as described in the section\n'Domain Generation Algorithm' of this post.\n\nOnce a C2 server has been identified for use by the malware, it then sends the encoded data\ncontaining system profile information and stores the C2 IP address in the following registry\nlocation:\n\n\n-----\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Piriform\\Agomo:NID\n\nThe malware then stores the value of the current system time plus two days into the\nfollowing registry location:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Piriform\\Agomo:TCID\n\nData received from the C2 server is then validated to confirm that the received data is in the\ncorrect format for a CCBkdr_ShellCode_Payload structure. An example is shown below:\n\n**Figure 6: CCBkdr_ShellCode_Payload Data Structure**\n\nThe malware then confirms that the value of EncryptedInstallID matches the value that was\npreviously transmitted to the C2 server. It then allocates memory for the final shellcode\npayload. The payload is then decoded using modified Base64 and stored into the newly\nallocated memory region. It is then decrypted and called with the addresses of LoadLibraryA\nand GetProcAddress as parameters. Once the payload has been executed, the memory is\ndeallocated and the following registry value is set to the current system time plus seven\ndays:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Piriform\\Agomo:TCID\n\nThe received buffer is then zeroed out and deallocated. The CCBkdr_ShellCode_Payload\nstructure is also deallocated and the malware then continues with normal CCleaner\noperations. A diagram describing the high level operation of this malware is below:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: Malware Operation Process Flow**\n\n### Domain Generation Algorithm\n\nIn situations where the primary C2 server does not return a response to the HTTP POST\nrequest described in the previous section, the malware fails back to using a DGA algorithm.\nThe algorithm used by this malware is time-based and can be calculated using the values of\nyear and month. A list of DGA domains is below:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8: 12 Month DGA Genearation**\nThe malware will initiate DNS lookups for each domain generated by the DGA algorithm. If\nthe DNS lookup does not result in the return of an IP address, this process will continue. The\nmalware will perform a DNS query of the active DGA domain and expects that two IP\naddresses will be returned from the name server managing the DGA domain's namespace.\nThe malware will then compute a secondary C2 server by performing a series of bit\noperations on the returned IP address values and combine them to determine the actual\nfallback C2 server address to use for subsequent C2 operations. A diagram showing this\nprocess is below:\n\n**Figure 9: C2 Process Diagram**\n\nCisco Talos observed during analysis that the DGA domains had not been registered, so we\nregistered and sinkholed them to prevent attackers from being able to use them for malicious\npurposes.\n\n## Potential Impact\n\n\n-----\n\nThe impact of this attack could be severe given the extremely high number of systems\npossibly affected. CCleaner claims to have over 2 billion downloads worldwide as of\nNovember 2016 and is reportedly adding new users at a rate of 5 million a week.\n\n**Figure 10: CCleaner Consumer Demographics**\n\nIf even a small fraction of those systems were compromised an attacker could use them for\nany number of malicious purposes. Affected systems need to be restored to a state before\nAugust 15, 2017 or reinstalled. Users should also update to the latest available version of\nCCleaner to avoid infection. At the time of this writing that is version 5.34. It is important to\n[note that according to the CCleaner download page, the free version of CCleaner does not](https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download)\nprovide automated updates, so this might be a manual process for affected users.\n\nIn analyzing DNS-based telemetry data related to this attack, Talos identified a significant\nnumber of systems making DNS requests attempting to resolve the domains associated with\nthe aforementioned DGA domains. As these domains have never been registered, it is\nreasonable to conclude that the only conditions in which systems would be attempting to\nresolve the IP addresses associated with them is if they had been impacted by this malware.\nWhile most of the domains associated with this DGA have little to no request traffic\nassociated with them, the domains related to the months of August and September (which\ncorrelates with when this threat was active in the wild) show significantly more activity.\n\nLooking at the DNS related activity observed by Cisco Umbrella for the month of July 2017\n(prior to CCleaner 5.33 being released) we observed very little in the way of DNS requests to\nresolve the IP address for DGA domain associated with this malware:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11: DNS Activity for July 2017 DGA Domain**\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this post, the version of CCleaner that included this malware was\nreleased on August 15, 2017. The following graph shows a significant increase in the amount\nof DNS activity associated with the DGA domain used in August 2017:\n\n**Figure 12: DNS Activity for August 2017 DGA Domain**\n\nLikewise, the DGA domain associated with September 2017 reflects the following activity\nwith regards to attempts to resolve the IP associated with it:\n\n**Figure 13: DNS Activity for September 2017 DGA Domain**\n\nNote that in on September 1, 2017 it appears that the DNS activity shifted from the DGA\ndomain previously used in August, to the one used in September, which matches the timebased DGA algorithm described in the \"Domain Generation Algorithm\" section of this blog\npost. After reaching out to Avast we noted that the server was taken down and became\nunavailable to already infected systems. As a result, we saw a significant increase in the\n\n\n-----\n\namount of requests that were being directed at the failback DGA domains used by the\nmalware.\n\n**Figure 14: Traffic Spike Following Server Takedown**\n\nIt is also worth noting that at the time of this post, antivirus detection for this threat remains\nvery low (The detections are at 1/64 at the time of this writing).\n\n**Figure 14: VirusTotal Detections for CCleaner Binary**\n\nAs part of our response to this threat, Cisco Talos has released comprehensive coverage to\nprotect customers. Details related to this coverage can be found in the \"Coverage\" section of\nthis post.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is a prime example of the extent that attackers are willing to go through in their attempt\nto distribute malware to organizations and individuals around the world. By exploiting the\ntrust relationship between software vendors and the users of their software, attackers can\nbenefit from users' inherent trust in the files and web servers used to distribute updates. In\nmany organizations data received from commonly software vendors rarely receives the same\nlevel of scrutiny as that which is applied to what is perceived as untrusted sources. Attackers\nhave shown that they are willing to leverage this trust to distribute malware while remaining\nundetected. Cisco Talos continues to monitor all aspects of the threat landscape to quickly\nidentify new and innovative techniques used by attackers to target organizations and\nindividuals around the world.\n\n## Coverage\n\nThe following ClamAV signatures have been released to detect this threat: 6336251,\n\n\n-----\n\n6336252.\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n\n[CWS orWSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html)\nused in these attacks.\n\n[AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html)\nproducts.\n\n[Umbrella, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious](https://umbrella.cisco.com/)\ndomains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n### File Hashes\n\n6f7840c77f99049d788155c1351e1560b62b8ad18ad0e9adda8218b9f432f0a9\n\n1a4a5123d7b2c534cb3e3168f7032cf9ebf38b9a2a97226d0fdb7933cf6030ff\n\n36b36ee9515e0a60629d2c722b006b33e543dce1c8c2611053e0651a0bfdb2e9\n\n### DGA Domains\n\nab6d54340c1a[.]com\n\naba9a949bc1d[.]com\n\nab2da3d400c20[.]com\nab3520430c23[.]com\n\nab1c403220c27[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nab1abad1d0c2a[.]com\nab8cee60c2d[.]com\nab1145b758c30[.]com\nab890e964c34[.]com\nab3d685a0c37[.]com\nab70a139cc3a[.]com\n\n### IP Addresses\n\n216[.]126[.]225[.]148\n\n\n-----",
