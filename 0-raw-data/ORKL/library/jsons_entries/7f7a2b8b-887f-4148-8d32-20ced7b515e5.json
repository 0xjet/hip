    "plain_text": "# Foreign Actors and Cybercriminals Likely to Spread Disinformation Regarding 2020 Election Results\n\n**ic3.gov/media/2020/200922.aspx**\n\n## September 22, 2020 (2020-09-22T11:00:00-04:00)\n\nAlert Number\n\n## I-092220-PSA\n\nQuestions regarding this PSA should be directed to your local FBI Field Office.\n\nLocal Field Office Locations: [www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Egress?url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency (CISA) are issuing this announcement to raise awareness of the potential threat\nposed by attempts to spread disinformation regarding the results of the 2020 elections.\nForeign actors and cybercriminals could create new websites, change existing websites, and\ncreate or share corresponding social media content to spread false information in an attempt\nto discredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.\n\nState and local officials typically require several days to weeks to certify elections’ final\nresults in order to ensure every legally cast vote is accurately counted. The increased use of\nmail-in ballots due to COVID-19 protocols could leave officials with incomplete results on\nelection night. Foreign actors and cybercriminals could exploit the time required to certify and\nannounce elections’ results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter\nsuppression, cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud, and other\nproblems intended to convince the public of the elections’ illegitimacy.\n\nThe FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the\ninformation they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information from trusted\nsources, such as state and local election officials. The public should also be aware that if\n\n\n-----\n\nforeign actors or cyber criminals were able to successfully change an election-related\nwebsite, the underlying data and internal systems would remain uncompromised.\n\nRecommendations\n\nSeek out information from trustworthy sources, such as state and local election\nofficials; verify who produced the content; and consider their intent.\nVerify through multiple reliable sources any reports about problems in voting or election\nresults, and consider searching for other reliable sources before sharing such\ninformation via social media or other avenues.\nFor information about final election results, rely on state and local government election\nofficials.\nReport potential election crimes—such as disinformation about the manner, time, or\nplace of voting—to the FBI.\nIf appropriate, make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for\nreporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information\nabout election-related problems or results.\n\nThe FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious\ncyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is\nresponsible for protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats.\nThe FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the security, integrity, and\nresiliency of the U.S. electoral processes.\n\nVictim Reporting and Additional Information\n\nThe FBI encourages victims to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to\n[their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices).
