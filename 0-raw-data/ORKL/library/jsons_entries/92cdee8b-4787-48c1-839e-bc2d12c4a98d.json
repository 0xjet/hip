In recent months, the malware used in the EITest campaign\n[has been ransomware such as Spora and](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/05/17/index.html) [Mole. However, by late August 2017, this](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/07/23/index.html)\ncampaign began pushing a different type of malware. Recent samples are shown to infect\nWindows hosts with the NetSupport Manager remote access tool (RAT). This is significant,\nbecause it indicates a potential shift in the motives of this adversary. Today's blog reviews\nrecent activity from these EITest HoeflerText popups on August 30, 2017 to discover more\nabout this recent change.\n\nFigure 1 below shows what victims see when they view a compromised website, and Figure\n2 shows the page if the user clicks the \"Update\" button. Chrome users should be suspicious\nof any pop-ups that match these images.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Fake HoeflerText popup after viewing a compromised site with the Chrome_\n_browser._\n\n_Figure 2: Clicking the \"update\" button sent us Font_Chrome.exe._\n\n## History\n\n[As early as December 2016, the EITest campaign began using HoeflerText popups to](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/EITest-Nabbing-Chrome-Users-Chrome-Font-Social-Engineering-Scheme)\n[distribute malware. Since late January 2017, we have only seen ransomware from these](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/01/30/index3.html)\npopups. The method has occasionally disappeared for weeks at a time. By July 2017, the\nHoeflerText popups [delivered Mole ransomware under the file name Font_Chrome.exe.](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/07/23/index.html)\nThese popups stopped in late July. But by late August 2017, they reappeared, and we saw a\n\n\n-----\n\ndifferent type malware sent under the file name Font_Chrome.exe. Recent examples\nreviewed by Unit 42 are not ransomware; they are file downloaders. Figure 3 below shows\nthe hits on Font_Chrome.exe in AutoFocus from July 16, 2017 through August 30, 2017.\n\n_Figure 3: Recent activity from fake HoeflerText popups in Google Chrome sending malware._\n\n## Recent Activity\n\nNetwork traffic follows two distinct paths. Victims who use Microsoft Internet Explorer as their\nweb browser will get a fake anti-virus alert with a phone number for a tech support scam.\nVictims using Google Chrome as their browser will get a fake HoeflerText popup as seen in\nFigure 1 that offers malware disguised as Font_Chrome.exe. Figure 4 shows the chain of\nevents for current activity from the EITest campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Chain of events for activity from the EITest campaign._\n\nCurrent samples of Font_Chrome.exe are file downloaders. They retrieve follow-up malware\nthat installs a NetSupport Manager remote access tool (RAT). NetSupport Manager is a\n[commercially-available RAT previously associated with a malware campaign from hacked](http://www.netsupportmanager.com/index.asp)\nSteam accounts last year. For the August 2017 HoeflerText popups, we have found two\nexamples of the file downloader and two examples of follow-up malware to install NetSupport\nManager RAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Traffic from a recent infection filtered in Wireshark._\n\n_Figure 6: The downloaded fake Chrome font program._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Double-clicking Font_Chrome.exe downloads and executes more malware._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Follow-up malware installs NetSupport Manger RAT on the infected Windows host._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: RAT configuration settings from an infected Windows host._\n\nNetSupport Manager is currently at version 12.5. The version seen on the infected host was\nversion 11.00.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsers should be aware of this ongoing threat. Be suspicious of popup messages in Google\nChrome that state: The \"HoeflerText\" font wasn't found. Since this is a RAT, infected users\nwill probably not notice any change in their day-to-day computer use. If the NetSupport\nManager RAT is found on your Windows host, it is probably related to a malware infection.\n\nIt's yet to be determined why EITest HoeflerText popups changed from pushing ransomware\nto pushing a RAT. Ransomware is still a serious threat, and it remains the largest category of\nmalware we see on a daily basis from mass-distribution campaigns. However, we have also\nnoticed an increasing amount of other forms of malware in recent campaigns, especially\ncompared to 2016. RATs give attackers more capabilities on a host and are generally much\nmore flexible than malware designed for a single purpose. The August 2017 change by\nEITest HoeflerText popups represents a subtle shift where ransomware is slightly less\nprominent than it once was.\n\nSee the section below for file names, locations, hashes, and other related information on\ntoday's infection.
