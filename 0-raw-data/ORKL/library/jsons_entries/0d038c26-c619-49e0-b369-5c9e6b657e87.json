Cobalt Strike is a\n\n commercial security testing tool made by the company Fortra, LLC. The application functions as\n\n a threat emulation program developed to simulate “Red Team” operations that are designed to\n\n execute targeted attacks and emulate post-exploitation activities of advanced threat actors for the\n\n1 As used in this action, \"cracked versions of Cobalt Strike\" refer to stolen, unlicensed, or otherwise unauthorized\nversions or copies of Cobalt Strike.\n\n###### 1\n\n\n-----\n\n###### purpose of testing the resilience of an organization’s cyber defenses. Defendants abuse Cobalt\n\n Strike’s capabilities by altering the authentic code to communicate with malicious command and\n\n control infrastructure to engage in illegal activities once a malware infiltrates a victim’s systems.\n\n More specifically, cracked versions of Cobalt Strike allow Defendants to gain control of their\n\n victim’s machine and move laterally through the connected network to find other victims and\n\n install malware. This includes installing ransomware like Conti, LockBit, Quantum Locker, Royal,\n\n Cuba, BlackBasta BlackCat and PlayCrypt, to arrest access to the systems. In essence, Defendants\n\n are able to leverage cracked versions of Cobalt Strike to brutally force their way into victim\n\n machines and deploy malware. Additionally, once the Defendants deploy the malware or\n\n ransomware onto computers running Microsoft’s Window operating system, Defendants are able\n\n to execute a series of actions involving abuse of Microsoft’s copyrighted declaring code. Not only\n\n do Defendants abuse Microsoft’s copyrighted declaring code in connection with their use of\n\n cracked Cobalt Strike, but Defendants further abuse Microsoft’s code when ransomware such as\n\n Conti of LockBit replicate the copyrighted declaring code in connection with executing various\n\n commands, such as terminating services that allow the system to encrypt files, disable real time\n\n monitoring of threats, or uninstalling the Windows Defender application (all which leave the\n\n victims’ computer further vulnerable). Unless enjoined and held accountable, Defendants will\n\n continue to use cracked versions of Cobalt Strike to proliferate malware, including ransomware.\n\n Defendants control the malicious command and control infrastructure leveraging cracked versions\n\n of Cobalt Strike by hosting and operating through the Internet Protocol addresses (“IP Addresses”)\n\n and domains set forth in Appendix A. Plaintiffs allege as follows:\n\n NATURE OF THE ACTION\n\n 1.

Microsoft is one of the world’s leading technology companies, providing complete,\n\n open, and integrated computer software programs and hardware systems. Microsoft[®] is a provider\n\n of the Windows[®] operating system, Microsoft Word, Microsoft’s word processing software. \n\n Microsoft has invested substantial resources in developing high-quality products and services. Due\n\n to the high quality and effectiveness of Microsoft’s products and services and the expenditure of\n\n 11\n\n\n-----\n\n###### significant resources by Microsoft to market those products and services, Microsoft has generated\n\n substantial goodwill with its customers, establishing a strong brand and developing the Microsoft\n\n name and the names of its products and services into strong and famous world-wide symbols that\n\n are well-recognized within its channels of trade. Microsoft has registered trademarks representing\n\n the quality of its products and services and its brand, including Microsoft[®] and Windows.[®] Copies\n\n of the trademark registrations for these trademarks are attached as Appendix B to this Complaint. \n\n 29. One of the pillars of Microsoft’s comprehensive portfolio of software programs is\n\n its Microsoft Windows operating system. Microsoft Windows is a group of proprietary graphical\n\n operating system families. Microsoft also spends considerable time and energy building its\n\n Windows platform and making it available to third-party developers to create programs that are\n\n compatible with Windows. With every Windows release, Microsoft also makes available a\n\n software development kit (“SDK”). The SDK is a package of programming tools including\n\n creative and original APIs, header files, libraries, documentation, code samples, processes, and\n\n guides that developers can use and integrate into their own applications. Microsoft’s SDKs are\n\n required when developing any application, program, or tool for Microsoft Windows. The code at\n\n issue in this case encompasses a type of code called “declarations” within header files and within\n\n libraries contained in the SDK, and referred to in this Complaint as the “Declaring Code.”\n\n 30. Microsoft owns copyrights in the code, documentation, specifications, libraries,\n\n and other materials that comprise the Windows operating system, including the Declaring Code.\n\n Microsoft’s Windows SDK copyrights, encompassing the Declaring Code, are registered with the\n\n United States Copyright Office, including those attached as Appendix C.\n\n 31. Microsoft makes its SDK and the code contained within the SDK, including the\n\n Declaring Code, available to the public through a license (“SDK License”). This enables Microsoft\n\n 12\n\n\n-----\n\n###### to maintain an open platform for third-party developers while preventing malicious actors from\n\n using the code in the SDK, including the Declaring Code, in a harmful way. Any developer who\n\n downloads Microsoft’s SDK tools, including the Declaring Code, must accept the terms of the\n\n SDK License.\n\n 32. Microsoft’s SDK License agreements make clear to end users that they are\n\n acquiring a license to use the software subject to certain limitations around the use of the software\n\n and place certain restrictions, including prohibiting end-users from using certain portions of the\n\n software code, including the header files in the SDK and associated Declaring Code, “in malicious,\n\n deceptive, or unlawful programs.”\n\n 33. Plaintiff Fortra is a technology company that manufactures, distributes and sells a\n\n variety of software products and services to businesses, professional organizations and educational\n\n institutions around the world. Fortra’s products address a wide range of cybersecurity and\n\n automation needs across a multitude of platforms. In cybersecurity, Fortra’s solutions typically fall\n\n into four categories: Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, Security Awareness Training &\n\n Managed Services. In particular, Fortra offers the “Cobalt Strike” product which is a commercial\n\n security testing tool to enable threat-representative security tests and threat emulation. Fortra owns\n\n copyrights in the code, documentation, specifications, libraries, and other materials that comprise\n\n the Cobalt Strike software. Fortra’s copyrights in Cobalt Stroke is attached as Appendix D. \n\n Additionally Fortra has registered trademarks representing the quality of its products and services\n\n and its brand, including Cobalt Strike.[®] Copies of the trademark registrations for these trademarks\n\n are attached as Appendix E to this Complaint. \n\n 34. Plaintiff H-ISAC is a membership organization comprised of public and private\n\n hospitals, ambulatory providers, health insurance payers, pharmaceutical/biotech manufacturers,\n\n 13\n\n\n-----\n\n###### laboratory, diagnostic, medical device manufacturers, medical schools, medical R&D\n\n organizations, and other relevant health sector stakeholders. H-ISAC represents the interests of its\n\n health care and public health industry members in combating and defending against cyber threats\n\n that pose risk and loss to the industry.

H-ISAC’s activities include sharing timely, actionable and relevant information,\n\n including intelligence on threats, incidents, and vulnerabilities that can include data such as\n\n indicators of compromise, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors, and acting\n\n upon that intelligence to mitigate cybersecurity threats and risk. Health care and public health\n\n institutions that are members of H-ISAC have generated substantial goodwill with their customers,\n\n established a strong brand, and developed their respective names and the names of their products\n\n and services into strong and famous world-wide symbols that are well recognized within their\n\n channels of trade.\n\n OVERVIEW OF LEGITIMATE VERSIONS COBALT STRIKE\n\n 35. Cobalt Strike is a commercial security testing tool made by Plaintiff Fortra LLC.\n\n The application functions as a threat emulation program developed to simulate “Red Team”\n\n operations that are designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate post-exploitation activities of\n\n advanced threat actors for the purpose of testing the resilience of an organization’s cyber defenses.\n\n 36. Cobalt Strike itself is a command and control application with two primary\n\n components: the team server and the client. A team server accepts client connections. The client\n\n is how operators connect to a team server. These two components are contained in a Java\n\n executable file (a “JAR file”). “Beacon” is the name for Cobalt Strike’s default simulated malware\n\n 14\n\n\n-----\n\n###### payload used to create a connection to the team server. The beacon file contains contact\n\n information such as the command and control IP address or domain, connection port information,\n\n watermark, and encryption keys. Legitimate penetration testers use this application to test whether\n\n an organization’s system would potentially succumb to the infiltration of malware into the\n\n network.\n\n CRACKED VERSIONS OF COBALT STRIKE\n\n 37. Compromised and cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are commonly referred to in\n\n the cybersecurity community as “cracked” versions and often consist of manipulated beacon files\n\n that are programmed to communicate with malicious command and control infrastructure to\n\n engage in illegal activities once a malware infiltrates a victim’s systems. More specifically,\n\n cracked versions of Cobalt Strike allow Defendants to gain control of their victim’s machine and\n\n move laterally through the connected network to find other victims and install malware. This\n\n includes installing ransomware like Conti, LockBit, Quantum Locker, Royal, Cuba, BlackBasta,\n\n BlackCat, and PlayCrypt, to gain access to the systems. In essence, Defendants are able to leverage\n\n cracked versions of Cobalt Strike to brutally force their way into victim machines and deploy\n\n malware.\n\n 38. Cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are distributed in various forums. Typically,\n\n these are the result of someone modifying a trial JAR file to bypass the license check and\n\n rebuilding the JAR file, or by crafting an authorization file with a fake license ID and distributing\n\n that with the JAR file.\n\n COMMAND AND CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE OF CRACKED COBALT STRIKE\n\n 39. Cobalt Strike is the command and control application itself. This has two primary\n\n components: the team server and the client. These are both contained in the same Java executable\n\n 15\n\n\n-----\n\n###### (“JAR file”) and the only difference is what arguments an operator uses to execute it:\n\n a. First component: Team server (Java component) is the command and control\n\n (“C2”) server portion of Cobalt Strike. It can accept client connections, BEACON callbacks, and\n\n general web requests.  \n\n b. Second component: Client (Java Component) is how operators connect to a team\n\n server. Clients can run on the same system as a Team server or connect remotely and can be run\n\n on Windows, macOS, or Linux systems.\n\n 40. Beacon is the name for Cobalt Strike’s default malware payload used to create a\n\n connection to the team server. It is a point for egress and once connected, an encrypted beacon\n\n binary is downloaded from the Cobalt Strike infrastructure. The Cobalt Strike beacon loader is\n\n responsible for downloading, decrypting the beacon binary, injecting code into a Windows\n\n process, and passing the control to the beacon binary. Essentially, when an cracked version of\n\n Cobalt Strike is created, the beacon that is part of the authentic Cobalt Strike tool is manipulated\n\n and repurposed to include in its code, malicious code that allows it to compromise victims’\n\n computers.\n\n 41. The command and control computers are specialized computers and/or software\n\n (“servers”). Defendants purchased or leased these servers and used them to send commands to\n\n control the infected victim computers. The command and control computers send the most\n\n fundamental instructions, modules, updates, and commands, and overall control of the malware is\n\n carried out from these computers. Command and control computers include the servers at various\n\n IP addresses and domains listed in Appendix A. \n\n 42. Each instance of cracked versions of Cobalt Strike infecting a user’s computing\n\n device is pre-programmed to connect and communicate with command and control servers. When\n\n 16\n\n\n-----\n\n###### such a connection is made, the servers can download instructions or additional malware to the\n\n infected computing device and upload stolen information from it.\n\n 43. To create the command and control computers, Defendants set up accounts with\n\n web-hosting providers - i.e., companies, usually legitimate, that provide facilities where computers\n\n can be connected through high-capacity connections to the Internet and locate their servers in those\n\n facilities. By contacting a command and control server, the cracked versions of Cobalt Strike can\n\n receive updated commands and modules from and communicate with the Defendants.\n\n 44. Figure 2 illustrates the communication channels of the cracked versions of Cobalt\n\n Strike, between the command and control servers and infected victim computers. \n\n Figure 2\n\n INFECTION OF VICTIM COMPUTERS\n\n 45. The cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are used by Defendants to compromise\n\n countless end user computers, of the type commonly found in businesses, living rooms, schools,\n\n libraries, and Internet cafes around the world. The Defendants are suspected of using various\n\n means of infecting end-user computers. Cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are disseminated via\n\n 17\n\n\n-----\n\n###### technical exploits of victim computers, malicious spam email, or spearphishing campaigns. These\n\n campaigns send unsolicited emails that direct users to download the cracked versions, constituting\n\n malware, from malicious websites, or trick the user into opening malware through an attachment,\n\n such as a Microsoft Word document.\n\n 46. Post-exploitation features of cracked, cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are\n\n implemented as Windows DLLs (modules). To execute these features, Cobalt Strike “spawns” a\n\n temporary process, and injects the module into it. Process injection is highly customizable to fit\n\n the individual operator’s preferences including but not limited to memory allocation, protections,\n\n obfuscation, and how to execute codes.\n\n 47. Figure 3 outlines the popular legitimate Windows processes utilized by Cobalt\n\n Strike for injecting the malicious modules.\n\n Figure 3\n\n 48. Although Cobalt Strike has the capability to upload and execute any tools based on\n\n malware operator’s choice, the cracked, cracked Cobalt Strike framework contains built-in\n\n commands that are implemented via modules (DLL). These tools are sent to the beacon DLL\n\n 18\n\n\n-----\n\n###### running on the victim machines and injected to the Windows processes (for example, the process\n\n svchost.exe), execute the module, and then report the result back to the operators via command\n\n and control server via HTTP post request.

Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) is a business model between ransomware\n\n operators and affiliates in which affiliates pay to launch ransomware attacks developed by\n\n operators. Due to the evolution to RaaS, cracked, versions of Cobalt Strike have become one of\n\n the go-to tools for the malware operators to persist in the victim machines and to monitor and carry\n\n on the intended attacks including installing ransomware, once suitable targets are identified. Each\n\n attacker group utilizes its own versions of cracked versions of Cobalt Strike and in most cases\n\n modifies/replaces the existing watermark with its own preferred value. Conti and LockBit are two\n\n such ransomware families leveraging cracked versions of Cobalt Strike.\n\n 51. Conti is an incredibly dangerous and damaging ransomware. Once the Conti\n\n ransomware is deployed and executed on a victim’s device, a variety of actions involving DLLs\n\n and Microsoft copyrighted APIs take place. Once deployed on a victim’s system, Conti will try to\n\n terminate a number of services to ensure that it can encrypt files, disable real time monitoring, and\n\n uninstalls the Windows Defender application, and subsequently demand a ransom or to engage in\n\n 20\n\n\n-----\n\n###### other malicious activity directed at the victims.\n\n 52. LockBit ransomware is malicious software designed to block user access to\n\n computer systems in exchange for a ransom payment. Later iterations of LockBit (LockBit 2.0 and\n\n 3.0) have increased sophistication: the “fastest encryption software” in the world, the ability to\n\n perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on the victims’ infrastructure, the ability to\n\n steal sensitive data, and the ability to use leak sites to expose companies’ proprietary data. \n\n DEFENDANTS JOINTLY LEVERAGE THE ENTERPRISE AND EACH OTHER’S WORKS\n\n 53. John Does 1-16 constitute a group of criminal persons associated together for a\n\n common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct, as part of an ongoing organization, with the\n\n various associates functioning as a continuing unit (hereinafter the “Racketeering Enterprise”). \n\n 54. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereupon allege that the Defendants’\n\n cooperative involvement in the development of cracked Cobalt Strike, the leverage of its\n\n capabilities to infiltrate victim computers, the development of malicious loaders to proliferate\n\n malware for the purpose of infecting victim computers, and the use of the cracked Cobalt Strike\n\n infrastructure to establish an attack framework (such as ransomware as a service), demonstrates\n\n that Defendants are acting in concert to cause significant harm to Plaintiffs, its customers, and\n\n member organizations, in order to achieve great monetary gain.\n\n 55. The Racketeering Enterprise has a purpose, with relationships among those\n\n associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit those associates to pursue the\n\n enterprise’s purpose. As Chart 2 below demonstrates, John Does 1-16 each have specialized roles\n\n in the Racketeering Enterprise, on which the success and furtherance of the Enterprise is entirely\n\n dependent. Namely, the Defendants leverage each other’s work to create, distribute and operate\n\n cracked Cobalt Strike infrastructure, distribute, and use customized Cobalt Strike loaders, gain\n\n 21\n\n\n-----\n\n###### access to victim computers using such infrastructure, and to install ransomware on victim\n\n computers and steal money from victims. The Defendants’ ongoing association with one another\n\n and reliance on each other’s contributions, allows the Enterprise to function as a continuing unit\n\n and within a lucrative operational structure. \n\n JOHN THREAT GROUP FUNCTION DOES\n John Does Various entities Cracked Cobalt Strike proliferation, providing 1-2 collectively referred to in infrastructure as a service for cybercriminals.\n this matter as John Does 1-2\n John Does Various entities Conti ransomware proliferation after compromise 3-4 collectively referred to in using cracked Cobalt Strike.\n this matter as John Does 3-4\n John Does Various entities LockBit ransomware proliferation after 5-6 collectively referred to in compromise using cracked Cobalt Strike.\n this matter as Does 5-6\n John Does DEV-0193 Develops, distributes, and manages many different 7-8 payloads, including Trickbot, Bazaloader, and\n AnchorDNS.

Upon information and belief, John Does 1-2, the creators and proliferators of\n\n cracked Cobalt Strike, work together with the purchasers, developers, and other sellers of the\n\n payloads, ransomware as a service options, cracked Cobalt Strike loaders in a continuous and\n\n coordinated manner to control, operate, and maintain the cracked Cobalt Strike infrastructure to\n\n distribute malicious code. \n\n 57. John Does 7-12 behave much like service providers and offer other groups the\n\n ability to leverage cracked Cobalt Strike to develop, distribute, and manage payloads, access\n\n networks, conduct reconnaissance into victim computers, and offer ransomware as a service. This\n\n allows purchasers like John Does 15-16 to leverage access obtained through John Does 7-12 to\n\n move laterally and stage Cobalt Strike payloads developed by John Does 13-14 to facilitate\n\n malware campaigns. \n\n 58. Plaintiffs’ investigation reveals that the Defendants work together in a continuous\n\n and coordinated manner to control, operate, distribute and maintain cracked Cobalt Strike, its\n\n infrastructure, and malicious payloads.\n\n THE CRACKED COBALT STRIKE RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE\n\n 59. The Racketeering Enterprise emerged in the past twenty-four months after certain\n\n JAR files of Cobalt Strike was reverse engineered and disseminated, and when subsequently John\n\n Doe 1 and John Doe 2 developed and established a command and control infrastructure to\n\n 23\n\n|JOHN DOES|THREAT GROUP|FUNCTION|\n|---|---|---|\n|John Does 15-16|DEV-0504|Relies on access brokers to enter a network, using Cobalt Strike beacons they purchased access to, to move laterally and stage their payloads.

John Does 3-16 joined the enterprise when they leveraged the command and\n\n control infrastructure to proliferate the ransomware, malicious payloads, and unauthorized\n\n network access.\n\n 60. The Racketeering Enterprise has continuously and effectively carried out its\n\n purpose of developing and operating a global command and control infrastructure that gains\n\n control of their victim’s machine, moves laterally through the connected network to find other\n\n victims, installs malware, and continues to do so absent the judicial relief that Plaintiffs request.\n\n 61. Both the purpose of the Racketeering Enterprise and the relationship between the\n\n Defendants is proven by: (1) the repeated development and dissemination of cracked versions of\n\n Cobalt Strike, (2) the subsequent development and operation of the command and control\n\n infrastructure to proliferate malware and leveraging of the infrastructure for Ransomware as a\n\n Service; and (3) Defendants’ respective and interrelated roles in the sale, operation of, and profiting\n\n from the cracked Cobalt Strike in furtherance of Defendants’ common financial interests.\n\n 62. Upon information and belief, Defendants have conspired to, and have, conducted\n\n and participated in the operations of the Racketeering Enterprise through a continuous pattern of\n\n racketeering activity as set forth herein. Each predicate act is related to and in furtherance of the\n\n common unlawful purpose shared by the members of the Racketeering Enterprise. These acts are\n\n continuing and will continue unless and until this Court grants Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary\n\n restraining order.\n\n 63. Upon information and belief, Defendants have conspired to, and have, knowingly\n\n and with intent to defraud trafficked in thousands of unauthorized access devices in the form of\n\n malware or ransomware infected end user terminals and network systems.\n\n 64. As set forth in detail herein, Defendants have used the command and control\n\n 24\n\n\n-----\n\n###### infrastructure to steal, intercept and obtain this access device information from countless\n\n individuals.\n\n 65. Upon information and belief, Defendants have also conspired to, and have,\n\n knowingly and with intent to defraud, possessed, and do possess, thousands of such unauthorized\n\n access devices fraudulently obtained as described herein.\n\n 66. Upon information and belief, Defendants have conspired to, and have, knowingly\n\n and with intent to defraud, extorted victims to receive millions of dollars in payment.\n\n 67. Upon information and belief, Defendants have conspired to, and have, executed a\n\n scheme to extort scores of healthcare institutions by enabling members of the Racketeering\n\n Enterprise to infect their healthcare network systems, encrypt data, and only release control of its\n\n systems and data through payment of ransom. \n\n 68. Each of the foregoing illegal acts were conducted using interstate ACH and/or\n\n interstate and/or foreign wires as described herein, and therefore affected interstate and/or foreign\n\n commerce.\n\n DEFENDANT’S UNAUTHORIZED USE OF MICROSOFT’S AND FORTRA’S COPYRIGHTED SOFTWARE\n\n 69. When Defendants developed cracked versions of Cobalt Strike, and when they\n\n create the Conti and LockBit ransomware, they reproduce hundreds of lines of Microsoft’s\n\n copyrighted Declaring Code in connection with their use of cracked Cobalt Strike to deploy\n\n malware and their creation of the Conti and LockBit ransomware. Defendants’ conduct was\n\n without authorization because the SDK License explicitly prohibits the use of Declaring Code in\n\n any malicious software. Defendants then transmit this malicious code through the Internet to the\n\n millions of infected computers, and reproduce the Declaring Code on command and control servers\n\n 25\n\n\n-----\n\n###### and infected device. \n\n 70. Hundreds of lines of Microsoft’s declaring code and the structure, sequence, and\n\n organization of that code are copied with and across cracked Cobalt Strike modules and\n\n ransomware like LockBit. An exemplary set of Declaring Code copied by Defendants in the\n\n LockBit ransomware, is reflected Figure 5 below.\n\n 26\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 5\n\n 71. When Defendants reproduced and distributed cracked versions of Cobalt Strike,\n\n Defendants copied the entirety of Fortra’s copyrighted Cobalt Strike team server code in cracked\n\n versions used for malicious purposes. The infringement involves unauthorized copying of\n\n executable code for all of the Cobalt Strike team server’s web server, beacon and configuration\n\n features and functionality, including all of Fortra’s creative and original method implementations,\n\n interfaces, parameters, variables, arrays, data types, operators, and objects.\n\n HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, THEIR CUSTOMERS AND MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE PUBLIC\n\n Defendants Cause Severe Harm by Engaging in Malicious Activities Against Victims Such as Deploying Ransomware\n\n 72. Defendants inflict severe harm on individuals whose computing devices are\n\n infected by their use of cracked versions of Cobalt Strike. Once a computing device is\n\n compromised by cracked versions of Cobalt Strike, Defendants can use the victim’s computer to\n\n send commands and instructions to the infected computing device to control it surreptitiously and\n 27\n\n\n-----\n\n###### deliver malware that, among other things, enables Defendants to take control of the victim’s\n\n computer and extort money from them. Defendants’ primary goal is to deliver ransomware and\n\n enable attacks against other computers. \n\n 73. The scope and scale of Defendants’ targeting of healthcare institutions is broad and\n\n global in nature. Healthcare organizations such as hospitals in the United States and the European\n\n Union have also been targeted by the Defendants. Thus, the threat posed by cracked versions of\n\n Cobalt Strike is shared by the entire healthcare industry, many other industries, and Microsoft as\n\n all must take substantial steps and make significant investments in defending against these types\n\n of activities.\n\n Defendants Cause Severe Harm by Distributing and Installing Other Types of Dangerous Malware\n\n 74. Defendants use cracked versions of Cobalt Strike to carry out a variety of illegal\n\n activities, but such cracked versions are well-known known as downloaders/droppers for\n\n delivering major malware families in what is known as a “malware-as-a-service” criminal\n\n business model that delivers ransomware that locks a victim’s computer and demands payment\n\n to unlock it, banking Trojans that steal funds from victim accounts, and a wide range of other\n\n types of malware.\n\n 75. In other words, one of the major activities associated with Defendants’ use of\n\n cracked versions of Cobalt Strike is downloading and spreading secondary malware and other\n\n malicious code onto infected computers, including the ransomware discussed in this declaration.\n\n Each of these secondary malware infections makes further changes to the user’s computing device,\n\n including by adding files, changing registry settings, opening additional backdoors that allow\n\n control by other cybercriminals, and allowing yet further sets of malware to be downloaded onto\n\n 28\n\n\n-----\n\n###### the computing device.\n\n Defendants Cause Severe Harm to Plaintiffs’ Reputation, Brands and Goodwill with Its Customers and Member Organizations\n\n 76. Defendants’ activities using the cracked versions of Cobalt Strike harm Microsoft\n\n and Microsoft’s customers by damaging the customers’ computing devices and the software\n\n installed on their computing devices, including Microsoft’s proprietary Windows operating\n\n systems. The cracked versions of Cobalt Strike are used by Defendants to infect and run on\n\n computer devices equipped with the Windows operating system. The Windows operating system\n\n is licensed by Microsoft to its users.\n\n 77. Microsoft’s customers whose computing devices are infected with cracked versions\n\n of Cobalt Strike used by Defendants are damaged by these changes to Windows, which alter the\n\n normal and approved settings and functions of the user’s operating system, place hooks into the\n\n operating system, destabilize it, and forcibly conscript the computing device into the Defendants’\n\n malicious activities. Customers are usually unaware of the fact that their computing devices are\n\n infected and have become part of the Defendants’ malicious Cobalt Strike infrastructure.\n\n 78. Defendants’ activities using the cracked versions of Cobalt Strike harm Fortra, by\n\n creating malicious instruments that are branded with Fortra’s trademark, to carry out cybercrime\n\n activities. Defendants’ activities risk substantial confusion among Fortra’s security community\n\n customers and consumers in general, and risk injuring Fortra’s commercial reputation.\n\n 79. Defendants’ activities using cracked versions of Cobalt Strike harm H-ISAC’s\n\n member healthcare organizations, not only through the infiltration of their healthcare network by\n\n ransomware, but also because of the injury to their brand and reputation of the member healthcare\n\n institutions. Defendants’ activities prompted H-ISAC’s pursuit of the interests of its member\n\n 29\n\n\n-----\n\n###### organizations, given the repeated attacks to its member organizations’ network systems. Further,\n\n with H-ISAC member organizations’ inability to provide consistent and reliable healthcare as a\n\n result of the impact on its network systems, the member organizations’ reputation is weakened\n\n given Defendants’ malicious activities.\n\n FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n\n Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems under the Digital Millennium Copyright\n\n Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1201\n\n (Microsoft, Fortra)\n\n 80. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs\n\n 1 through 79 above.\n\n 81. Microsoft owns copyrights in the code, documentation, specifications, libraries,\n\n and other materials that comprise the Windows system and the associated SDK.\n\n 82. Fortra own copyrights in the code, documentation, specifications, libraries, and\n\n other materials that comprise Fortra’s Cobalt Strike software.\n\n 83. Defendants circumvent technological measures in relation to cracked Cobalt Strike\n\n software, which includes Fortra’s and Microsoft’s copyrighted code, in order to access and\n\n reproduce that code for the purpose of proliferating malware, including ransomware. By creating\n\n cracked versions of Cobalt Strike in this way, Defendants thereby manufacture, distribute, and use\n\n software that is primarily designed, produced, or marketed for the purpose of circumventing\n\n technological measures that control access to and copying of copyrighted works.\n\n 84. As a result of the Defendants’ actions, Microsoft’s and Fortra’s copyrighted code\n\n has been accessed, copied, distributed, or otherwise used without authorization or compensation,\n\n causing Microsoft to suffer irreparable harm and damages. \n\n 30\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 85. Microsoft and Fortra therefore seeks injunctive relief, damages, and any other\n\n remedies available under the DMCA and other applicable laws, as well as attorney’s fees and costs.\n\n 86. As a direct result of Defendant’s actions, Microsoft and Fortra suffered and\n\n continue to suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and which will\n\n continue unless Defendants’ actions are enjoined.\n\n SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n\n Copyright Infringement, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.\n\n (Microsoft, Fortra)\n\n 87. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs\n\n 1 through 86 above.\n\n 88. Microsoft owns copyrights in the code, documentation, specifications, libraries,\n\n and other materials that comprise the Windows system and the associated SDK. \n\n 89. By Defendants’ actions alleged above, Defendants have infringed and will continue\n\n to infringe, the Declaring Code by, inter alia, distributing, and creating derivative works in their\n\n cracked version of Cobalt Strike, which reproduce Microsoft’s copyrighted declaring code for\n\n Windows 8 Software Development Kit, which is required for the functionality of the cracked\n\n versions of Cobalt Strike, in violation of Microsoft’s exclusive rights at least under 17 U.S.C. §\n\n 101 et seq. without any authorization or other permission from Microsoft. \n\n 90. Defendants have reproduced and distributed cracked versions of Cobalt Strike\n\n containing Microsoft’s Declaring Code on devices worldwide. Defendants proliferate them from\n\n hosting companies that provide “hosting services,” which assign to those devices particular IP\n\n addresses to have a presence on the Internet. Defendants use the hosting services to transmit the\n\n malicious software through the Internet to the victims. Such use is not authorized. Defendants have\n\n 31\n\n\n-----\n\n###### thus induced, caused, and materially contributed to the infringing acts of others by inducing,\n\n allowing, and assisting others to copy and distribute the infringing code. \n\n 91. Defendants’ infringement of Microsoft’s copyrights has been deliberate, willful,\n\n and in utter disregard of Microsoft’s rights. \n\n 92. Defendants’ malicious software also infringes Fortra’s copyright by literally\n\n copying the entirety of its copyrighted Cobalt Strike “team server” code in a cracked version used\n\n for malicious purposes. The infringement involves cracked copying of executable code for all of\n\n the Cobalt Strike team server’s web server, beacon and configuration features and functionality,\n\n including all of Fortra’s creative and original method implementations, interfaces, parameters,\n\n variables, arrays, data types, operators, and objects. \n\n 93. Defendants have realized unjust profits, gain, and advantages as a proximate result\n\n of their infringement. \n\n 94. Defendants will continue to realize unjust profits, gain, and advantages as a\n\n proximate result of their infringement as long as such infringement is permitted to continue. \n\n 95. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ willful copyright infringement,\n\n Microsoft has suffered, and will continue to suffer, monetary loss to its business, reputation, and\n\n goodwill. Microsoft is entitled to recover from Defendants, in amounts to be determined at trial,\n\n the damages it has sustained and will sustain, and any gains, profits, and advantages obtained by\n\n Defendants as a result of Defendants’ acts of infringement and use and publication of copied\n\n materials.  \n\n 96. Plaintiffs Microsoft and Fortra are entitled to an injunction restraining Defendants\n\n from engaging in any further such acts in violation of the United States copyright laws. Unless\n\n Defendants are enjoined and prohibited from infringing Microsoft’s and Fortra’s copyrights,\n\n 32\n\n\n-----\n\n###### inducing others to infringe Microsoft’s and Fortra’s copyrights, and unless all infringing products\n\n and advertising materials are seized, Defendants will continue to intentionally infringe and induce\n\n infringement of Microsoft’s and Fortra’s registered copyrights.\n\n THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n\n Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030\n\n (Microsoft, H-ISAC)\n\n 97. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs\n\n 1 through 96 above.\n\n 98. Defendants knowingly and intentionally accessed and continue to access protected\n\n computers without authorization and knowingly caused the transmission of a program,\n\n information, code and commands, resulting in damage to the protected computers, the software\n\n residing thereon, Microsoft, and Fortra.\n\n 99. Defendants’ conduct involved interstate and/or foreign communications.\n\n 100. Defendants’ conduct has caused a loss to Microsoft during a one-year period\n\n aggregating at least $5,000.\n\n 101. Defendants’ conduct has caused a loss to H-ISAC during a one-year period\n\n aggregating at least $5,000.\n\n 102. Plaintiffs Microsoft and H-ISAC seek injunctive relief and compensatory and\n\n punitive damages under 18 U.S.C. §1030(g) in an amount to be proven at trial.\n\n 103. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to\n\n suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and which will continue\n\n unless Defendants’ actions are enjoined.\n\n FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n\n 33\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701\n\n (Microsoft, H-ISAC)\n\n 104. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs\n\n 1 through 103 above. \n\n 105. Microsoft’s Windows operating system software, and Microsoft’s customers’\n\n computers running such software, and the network infrastructure of H-ISAC’s member healthcare\n\n institutions are facilities through which electronic communication service is provided to users,\n\n customers, and patients.\n\n 106. Defendants knowingly and intentionally accessed the Windows operating system\n\n and H-ISAC’s members’ healthcare network infrastructure, and associated software, services and\n\n computers upon which this software and services run without authorization or in excess of any\n\n authorization granted by Microsoft or H-ISAC’s members.\n\n 107. Through this unauthorized access, Defendants intercepted, had access to, obtained\n\n and altered, and/or prevented legitimate, authorized access to, wire and electronic communications\n\n transmitted through the computers and infrastructure of Microsoft and its users and H-ISAC’s\n\n members and their users. \n\n 108. In connection with this interception, Defendants have used modules such as\n\n Keyloggers to intercept and gain access to the contents of such wire and electronic\n\n communications, including acess to the passwords, personal identifying information, sensitive\n\n financial information, or personal health information contained in such communications. \n\n 109. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages in an\n\n amount to be proven at trial.\n\n 110. As a direct result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to\n\n 34\n\n\n-----\n\n###### suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and which will continue\n\n unless Defendants’ actions are enjoined.\n\n FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n\n False Designation of Origin under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)\n\n (Microsoft, Fortra, H-ISAC)\n\n 111. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs\n\n 1 through 110 above. \n\n 112. Microsoft’s, Fortra’s, and H-ISAC member institutions’ trademarks are distinctive\n\n marks that are associated with Microsoft, Fortra, and H-ISAC’s member institutions and\n\n exclusively identify their businesses, products, and services.\n\n 113. Defendants make unauthorized use of Microsoft’s, Fortra’s, and H-ISAC’s member\n\n institutions’ trademarks. By doing so, Defendants create false designations of origin as to tainted\n\n Microsoft products, cracked Fortra Cobalt Strike, and H-ISAC member institution services that\n\n are likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception.\n\n 114.
