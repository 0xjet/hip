The three InPage exploit files are linked through their use of very similar shellcode,\nwhich suggests that either the same actor is behind these attacks, or the attackers have access\nto a shared builder. The documents were found to drop the following malware families:\n\nThe [previously discussed CONFUCIUS_B malware family](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/09/unit42-confucius-says-malware-families-get-further-by-abusing-legitimate-websites/)\nA backdoor previously not discussed in the public domain, commonly detected by some\nantivirus solutions as “BioData”\nA previously unknown backdoor that we have named MY24\n\nThe use of InPage as an attack vector is not commonly seen, with the only previously noted\n[attacks being documented by Kaspersky in late 2016.](https://securelist.com/inpage-zero-day-exploit-used-to-attack-financial-institutions-in-asia/76717/)\n\nThe decoy documents used by the InPage exploits suggest that the targets are likely to be\npolitically or militarily motivated. They contained subjects such as intelligence reports and\npolitical situations related to India, the Kashmir region, or terrorism being used as lure\n\n\n-----\n\ndocuments.\nIn the blog below, we analyze and present our findings on three of these malicious InPage\ndocuments:\n\nWe also include analysis of the new backdoor we discovered: MY24.\n\nCyber Advisory No 91.inp\n\nWe discovered the first InPage exploit to have the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 1d1e7a6175e6c514aaeca8a43dabefa017ddc5b166ccb636789b6a767181a022\n\n\n**Original**\n**Filename**\n\n\nCyber Advisory No 91.inp\n\n\nThe exploit for this document is the same one described by described by Kaspersky late last\nyear. This exploit was unsuccessful in the latest version in InPage (Version 3.60), and as such\nthe underlying vulnerability has likely been patched.\nOverall, the entire execution flow of this malware from start to finish can be summarized as\nfollows:\n\n_Figure 1 InPage exploit document execution flow_\n\nWhen the malicious .INP file is opened using a vulnerable version of InPage, it will execute the\nshellcode that is embedded within it.\n\nThis particular shellcode, along with the shellcode found within another InPage exploit\ndocument that will be discussed later on, began with a marker of ‘LuNdLuNd’, followed by a\nseries of NOPs. It continues to identify an offset to an embedded executable file, which will\n\n\n-----\n\neventually be run on the victim machine.\nThis particular shellcode uses a unique hashing mechanism for identifying and loading Microsoft\nWindows libraries and functions. It uses this method to load a series of functions, as seen\nbelow:\n\n_Figure 2 Shellcode loading functions using custom hashing algorithm_\n\nThe hashing algorithm in question can be represented in Python as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n\ndef hashAlgo(string):\nhsh = 0\nfor c in string:\nv1 = ord(c) | 0x60\nhsh = 2 * (hsh + v1)\nreturn hsh\nlibrary = \"ntdll.dll\"\nfunction = \"memcpy\"\nprint \"[+] '{}' Library: 0x{:x}\".format(library, hashAlgo(library))\nprint \"[+] '{}' Function: 0x{:x}\".format(function, hashAlgo(function))\nOutput:\n\n[+] 'ntdll.dll' Library: 0x1b708\n\n[+] 'memcpy' Function: 0x347a\n\n\nThis particular hashing algorithm does not appear to be widely used, however, in our searches\nusing the YARA rule provided at the end of this blog, we were able to identify roughly 70 PE32\nsamples that have recently employed this same hashing technique.\n\nThe shellcode then proceeds to attempt to create a mutex with a value of “QPONMLKJIH” to\nensure only one instance of the shellcode is running at a given time. Finally, the shellcode will\ncopy the embedded payload into newly allocated memory before executing it.\n\nThis newly dropped payload is a DLL with the following attributes:\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** 7bbf14ced3ca490179d3727b7287eb581c3a730131331be042d0f0510bc804f9\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2015-05-08 12:51:54 UTC\n\n\n**PDB String** c:\\users\\mz\\documents\\visual studio\n2013\\Projects\\Shellcode\\Release\\Shellcode.pdb\n\nThis particular DLL acts as a dropper, and has two embedded resource files—an executable\npayload that will be used to ultimately drop the final payload, as well as a decoy InPage file. It\nbegins by spawning a new thread that loads the two files from embedded resources with names\nof ‘BIN’ and ‘BIN2’ respectively. The executable is dropped to the following path before it is\nexecuted:\n\n%TEMP%\\winopen.exe\n\nThe InPage decoy document is dropped to the following path before it is run:\n\n%TEMP\\SAMPLE.INP\n\nThe decoy document in question looks like the following. The rough translation to English has\nbeen provided in red:\n\n_Figure 3 Decoy InPage file with rough translation_\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the rough translation of this document, it appears to deal with current issues within the\nKashmir region. This of course is not consistent with the original filename, and it is unclear why\nthis is the case. Perhaps the attacker forgot to change the lure from a previous exploit, or simply\ndidn’t find it necessary. This lure, while inconsistent with the original filename, is in line with the\nother InPage exploit file that also looked to be of the same subject matter.\nThe executable file in the ‘%TEMP%\\winopen.exe’ path has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 692815d06b720669585a71bc8151b89ca6748f882b35e365e08cfaf6eda77049\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2017-07-31 06:03:42 UTC\n\n\nThis particular executable is made to resemble the legitimate application Putty. Unlike other files\nwe witnessed up to this point, this sample has rudimentary anti-debugging and anti-analysis\ntechniques in place prior to the main execution flow.\nIt proceeds to decrypt an embedded resource object using the RC4 algorithm. The following key\nis used for decryption:\n\nVACqItywGR1v3qGxVZQPYXxMZV0o2fzp\n\nAfter this data is decrypted, the following registry key is written to ensure persistence. Again, we\nsee the malware mimic the appearance of the legitimate Putty application.\n\nHKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\Putty %TEMP%\\winopen.exe\n\nFinally, the malware will spawn a new suspended instance of itself, where the decrypted data is\nwritten and subsequently executed.\nThis next stage of malware has the following properties:\n\n**SHA256** bb5540fe0bbc0cda08865aad891a585cd465b224bfe84762216cd04178087516\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2017-05-17 05:47:05 UTC\n\n\nThis malware operates almost identical to the previously witnessed sample. However, this time\nthe embedded resource object is decrypted using the following RC4 key:\n\nkRPAnN2DN6vfrxsJ55Lntnh7Mma8E68s\n\nThe next, and last stage of this malware execution has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** d1a14bc3160f5ed6232ceaf40de1959d7dba3eae614efd2882b04d538cda825b\n\n\n-----\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2016-10-31 02:41:09 UTC\n\n\nThis final payload is an instance of the CONFUCIUS_B malware family, which we have\npreviously discussed. This particular sample attempts to connect to the following host for C2\noperations:\n\n151.80.14[.]194\n\nIntelligence Report-561 (1).inp\n\nWe identified this malicious InPage document as having the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 35c5f6030513f11fd1dcf9bd232de457ba7f3af3aedc0e2e976895b296a09df6\n\n\n**Original**\n**Filename**\n\n\nIntelligence Report-561 (1).inp\n\n\nThis particular exploit file uses the exact same shellcode witnessed previously, where an\nembedded DLL is loaded into memory. Again, this executable drops and executes two files—a\nMicrosoft Windows executable payload and an InPage decoy document.\nThe embedded payload within the shellcode has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 83e3b2938ee6a3e354c93c6ec756da96b03cc69118b5748b07aee4d900da1844\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2015-05-08 12:51:54 UTC\n\n\n**PDB String** c:\\users\\mz\\documents\\visual studio\n2013\\Projects\\Shellcode\\Release\\Shellcode.pdb\n\nAgain, we see the executable payload and decoy document dropped to the following respective\nlocations:\n\n%TEMP%\\winopen.exe\n%TEMP%\\SAMPLE.inp\n\nThe dropped executable is a previously undocumented backdoor written in Delphi that has been\nnamed BioData by multiple antivirus organizations.\nThis InPage exploit document follows a much simpler execution flow, as seen in the following\ndiagram.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 InPage exploit execution flow_\n\nThe decoy InPage file dropped by this malware looks like the following. The language used\nwithin it appears to be a mix of Arabic and Urdu. A rough translation has been provided in red in\nthe image below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Decoy InPage document dropped by malware_\n\nThe Biodata payload has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 5716509e4cdbf8ffa5fbce02b8881320cb852d98e590215455986a5604a453f7\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n1992-06-19 22:22:17 UTC\n\n\nNote that the timestamp above is the result of this sample being compiled in Delphi, which uses\nthe same hardcoded compilation timestamp for all samples that are generated.\nThroughout the execution of this sample, numerous strings are decoded using a customized 94character substitution table. BioData will go through each character of the obfuscated string,\nand will replace each character based on the following table:\n\n_Figure 6 Substitution table used by BioData_\n\nThe malware proceeds to generate and create a ‘Document’ folder within the\n%USERPROFILE% directory. This folder will contain all of the malware’s files throughout its\nexecution. In order to maintain persistence, the malware will generate the following file in the\nstartup folder, which points to the current path of the BioData executable:\n\nAdobe creative suit.lnk\n\nBioData proceeds to generate a randomized 30-character string of uppercase and lowercase\nletters. This string is written to the following file:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Document\\users.txt\n\nThis 30-character string is used by the malware to act as a unique identifier for the victim, and\nwill be used for all network communication with a remote server.\n\nThe username and computer name are identified, and are written to a string of the following\nformat:\n\nUser name and System Name :- [Username]_[Computer Name]\n\nThis data is obfuscated and written to the following file:\n\n\n-----\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Document\\SyLog.log\n\nIn order to obfuscate this data, the malware uses a unique algorithm. Represented in Python,\nthe following script will decode this file:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n\n\nimport sys\nfrom binascii import *\nfile = sys.argv[1]\nfh = open(file, 'rb')\nfd = fh.read()\nfh.close()\ndef bit_not(n, numbits=8):\nreturn (1 << numbits) - 1 - n\ndef decode(data):\nc = 0\noutput = \"\"\nfor d in data:\no = bit_not((0x6121 >> c) & 0xFF)\noutput += chr(ord(d) ^ o)\nc += 1\nif c == 32:\nc = 0\nreturn output\nprint decode(fd)\n\n\nBioData sends both GET and POST requests to the following URL:\n\nhttp://errorfeedback[.]com/MarkQuality455/developerbuild.php\n\nPOST requests are made with a hardcoded User-Agent, shown below in Figure 7. Additionally,\na ‘b’ GET parameter is included that contains the victim’s previously generated unique identifier.\nThe contents of the POST requests are the obfuscated SyLog.log file. The remote C2 server\nhas been observed responding to these requests with ‘Success’. These requests simply act as\na beacon, including the basic victim information that was previously obtained.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 HTTP POST request by BioData_\n\nGET requests are made in a slightly different fashion. These requests contain an empty UserAgent, and are also found to be missing a number of HTTP headers that are commonly seen.\n\n_Figure 8 HTTP GET request by BioData_\n\nUnlike the POST requests, the malware both looks for and makes use of the response given, if\nany, by the C2 server. The malware parses any response given by first hex-decoding it. It then\nbase64-decodes the resulting string. The final string is used to form a subsequent GET request.\n\nIf for instance, the malware responded with a decoded string of ‘malware.exe’, the subsequent\nGET request would look like the following:\n\nhttp://errorfeedback[.]com/MarkQuality455/bzGwXILtkMRZaJxzciXAeCYviduBuy/malware.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nThe request above uses the same victim identifier that has been observed in the previous\nexamples provided.\nThis hypothetical ‘malware.exe’ request contains the raw contents of the payload that BioData\nwill drop to disk and execute. The contents are placed in the following file path for this\nhypothetical:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Document\\malware.exe\n\nFinally, after this dropped payload is successfully executed, the malware will send a GET\nrequest such as the following:\n\nhttp://errorfeedback[.]com/MarkQuality455/developerbuild.php?\nf=62574673643246795a53356c654755&b=bzGwXILtkMRZaJxzciXAeCYviduBuy\n\nIn the above example, the ‘b’ parameter is the victim identifier, and the ‘f’ parameter is the string\nof ‘malware.exe’ after it has been base64-encoded and hex-encoded. This request alerts the\nattack that the hypothetical payload of ‘malware.exe’ has been run.\n\nTehreek-E-Kashmir Mujahaid List.inp\n\nWe identified this malicious InPage document as having the following attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 3e410397955d5a127182d69e019dbc8bbffeee864cd9c96e577c9c13f05a232f\n\n\n**Original**\n**Filename**\n\n\nTehreek-E-Kashmir Mujahaid List.inp\n\n\nUnfortunately, no decoy document was included with this exploit file. However, the filename\nprovides clues as to the context that may have been present when this file was delivered to the\nintended recipient. The phrase ‘Tehreek-E-Kashmir’ is most likely related to the conflict in the\nKashmir region of India. Additionally, the term ‘Mujahaid’ may be a misspelling of the word\n‘Mujahid’, a term used to describe an individual engaged in Jihad.\nThis particular InPage shellcode looks to be near identical to the two others previously\ndiscussed, however, it appears as though the attackers simply partially overwrote the original\nshellcode that was present to substitute their own. This results in the shellcode acting as a\ndownloader, instead of loading an embedded payload. We can see the modifications visually in\nthe following image:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 Differences between InPage exploit documents_\n\nIn the image above, the ‘Cyber Advisory No 91.inp’ exploit file has the large additional size, as it\nincluded the payload. The ‘Tehreek-E-Kashmir Mujahaid List.inp’ exploit file instead has\nremoved this. However, original artifacts from the original shellcode are still present, including\nthe function that loads Microsoft Windows API calls using the unique hashing algorithm.\n\nThe shellcode begins by iterating through the Process Environment Block (PEB), searching for\na loaded module that has a ‘3’ in the 7 position. In other words, the shellcode uses a simpleth\ntrick to search for kernel32.dll. It proceeds to iterate through kernel32’s functions, looking for the\nGetProcAddress function. In order to find this function it will compare the first four letters against\n‘GetP’, and the third set of four letters against ‘ddre’.\n\nThe shellcode then gets the address of the WinExec function, which in turn is used to execute\nthe following command:\n\ncmd /c mkdir C:\\Wins\n\nIt then performs the following:\n\n1. Gets the address of the LoadLibraryA function\n2. Loads the urlmon.dll library\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Gets the address of the URLDownloadToFileA function\n\nThe shellcode then proceeds to make a request to the following URL and download the\nresponse to ‘C:\\Wins\\cnh’.\n\nhttp://zmwardrobe[.]com/wp-sign\n\nFinally, the shellcode will execute this downloaded file via a call to WinExec.\nThe response from this webserver returned a payload, that we have named MY24, with the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n**SHA256** 71b7de2e3a60803df1c3fdc46af4fd8cfb7c803a53c9a85f7311348f6ff88cbe\n\n\n**Compile**\n**Timestamp**\n\n\n2017-05-18 05:26:54 UTC\n\n\nIt should also be noted that a malicious Microsoft Word document with the following properties\nwas observed downloading and executing the same payload.\n\n**SHA256** 3f1d3d02e7707b2bc686b5add875e1258c65a0facd5cf8910ba0f321e230e17c\n\n\n**Original**\n**Filename**\n\n\nLas Vegas ISIS Claim Proof.doc\n\n\n**First Seen** 2017-10-05 05:53:27\n\n**MY24 Analysis**\nThis backdoor begins by decoding a series of embedded strings by adding 33 to each character.\nThe following example within the Python interpreter demonstrates this:\n\n_Figure 10 Example string decoding within Python interpreter_\n\nThe malware proceeds to execute a function that is responsible for generating the following\npath:\n\n\n-----\n\n%APPDATA%\\Startup\\wintasks.exe\n\nHowever, this path is never used, leading us to believe that the malware author had the\nintention of copying the payload to this destination and likely setting persistence, but seemingly\nforgot to.\nMY24 proceeds to spawn two timers where the functions are responsible for resolving the C2\ndomain of userveblog.ddns[.]net, as well as connecting to this domain.\nTwo new threads are then created—one for handling any data that is received from the\nconnection to the C2 and one that is responsible for sending out data.\nFinally, a function is called that is responsible for collecting information about the victim\nmachine. The following information is collected:\n\nVersion of Microsoft Windows\nUsername\nComputer name\n\nThe MY24 instance expects to receive a command initially from the remote server of\nuserveblog.ddns[.]net on port 9832. All communication is performed using raw sockets via a\ncustom communication protocol. The packets received by the malware have the following\nformat:\n\n_Figure 11 Received packet format for MY24 malware_\n\nAll data received and sent by MY24 is encrypted using a 13-byte XOR key of \"t6%9k$2Ri9ctv\".\nThe data portion of the received command will include one of the following commands:\n\n**Received Command** **Description**\n\n2000 Return victim information\n\n2001 Get drive information\n\n2002 List files\n\n2004 Unknown\n\n2005 Create file handle to append data\n\n2006 Write appended data to previously created file handle\n\n2007 Create file handle for reading data\n\n\n-----\n\n2009 Read data from previously created file handle\n\n2012 Spawn a shell of cmd.exe\n\n2013 Interact with previously spawned shell\n\n2015 Unknown\n\n2016 Kill previously spawned shell\n\n2019 List current process network communication on the victim machine\n\n2021 Unknown\n\n2022 Kill process\n\n2023 Enumerate processes\n\n2025 Unknown\n\nResponses sometimes vary in size, but are primarily sent with a size of 9084 bytes. The author\nof this tool did not allocate proper buffer size when sending out the data, resulting in part of the\nstack being included in the response by the MY24 malware. Examples of commands being sent\nand received may be seen below. A custom server was written to interact with the MY24\nmalware, which is seen in the following image.\n\n_Figure 12 Interacting with MY24 backdoor_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile documents designed to exploit the InPage software are rare, they are not new - however\nin recent weeks Unit42 has observed numerous InPage exploits leveraging similar shellcode,\nsuggesting continued use of the exploit previously discussed by Kaspersky.\n\nThe decoy documents dropped suggest that the targets are likely to be politically or militarily\n\n\n-----\n\nmotivated, with subjects such as Intelligence reports and political situations being used as lure\ndocuments. The variety of malware payloads dropped suggests the attackers behind these\nattacks have a reasonable development resource behind them and Unit42 continues to observe\nnew versions of these malware families being created.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against these threats in a number of ways:\n\nAll domains observed in these malware families have been flagged as malicious.\nAll payloads are appropriately categorized as malicious within the WildFire platform and\nblocked by Traps.\n[The payloads witnessed have been tagged in AutoFocus as Confucius_B,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Confucius_B) [MY24,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.MY24)\n[and BioData for continued tracking and observation.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.BioData)\n\nAppendix\n**YARA Rules**\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\nrule InPageShellcodeHashing\n{\nstrings:\n$hashingFunction = {55 8B EC 51 53 52 33 C9 33 DB 33 D2 8B 45 08 8A 10 80 CA 60 03\nDA D1 E3 03 45 10 8A 08 84 C9 E0 EE 33 C0 8B 4D 0C 3B D9 74 01 40 5A 5B 59 8B E5\n5D C2 0C 00}\ncondition:\n$hashingFunction\n}\n\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
