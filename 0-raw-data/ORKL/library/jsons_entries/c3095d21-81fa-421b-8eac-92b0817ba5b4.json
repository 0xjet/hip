The files are designed to conduct three types of attacks,\nNTP_Attack, DNS_Attack, and CGN_Attack. The files also establish backdoor command-and-control capability on the victim system.\n\n\n**Files**\n\n\n**Processed** 3\n584ac94142f0b7c0df3d0adde6e661ed (mimefilter.xml_584AC94142F0B7C0DF3D0ADDE6E661ED)\n5d29dfe2ea9ca8da3ff7a14fb20c5e86 (5D29DFE2EA9CA8DA3FF7A14FB20C5E86)\n8f4fc2e10b6ec15a01e0af24529040dd (8F4FC2E10B6EC15A01E0AF24529040DD)\n\n\n**IPs**\n\n\n**Identified** 2\n[202.126.90.89](http:202.126.90.89)\n[153.68.198.14](http:153.68.198.14)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Files\n\n### 5D29DFE2EA9CA8DA3FF7A14FB20C5E86\n\n\n**Details**\n\n\n**Name** 5D29DFE2EA9CA8DA3FF7A14FB20C5E86\n\n**Size** 180224\n\n**Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**MD5** 5d29dfe2ea9ca8da3ff7a14fb20c5e86\n\n**SHA1** 3fdf856b6fbcb23e7c3372a3f53ce26c0fe6de77\n\n**ssdeep** 3072:9sCh49HhQS2qaWuLYyJHYnGerQJDu70cSrzdZHlIbFX:9sCh4TQqaZYyJHYGen70lzdZFSZ\n\n**Entropy** 6.13711245238\n\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n**ClamAV** Win.Trojan.Agent-1388767\n\n**Kaspersky** HackTool.Win32.Agent.aesh\n\n**Microsoft Security Essentials** Backdoor:Win32/Winsec.B!dha\n\n**TrendMicro House Call** BKDR_SCADPRV.B\n\n**TrendMicro** BKDR_SCADPRV.B\n\n\n**PE Information**\n\n\n**Compiled** 2014-12-17T14:03:38Z\n\n\n**PE Sections**\n\n\n**Name** **MD5** **Raw Size** **Entropy**\n\n(header) 6a5356bedf23ccecac180cd887c15de8 4096 0.792314879114\n\n.text 72d9f7da3d7eb917a18954668399ce67 77824 6.14523436219\n\n.rdata af59deeeff5d5f41ecdd092b80536d25 8192 3.96837828979\n\n.data b994d715f522732213ea03cb2013a469 12288 4.24722552284\n\n.rsrc 219125d84f95e9ec104a49383da7b991 77824 6.31904971708\n\n\n**Packers**\n\n\n**Name** **Version** **Entry Point**\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ v6.0 NA NA\n\n\n**Relationships**\n\n\n(F) 5D29DFE2EA9CA8DA3FF7A14FB20C5E86\nConnected_To (I) 202.126.90.89\n(5d29d)\n\n\n(F) 5D29DFE2EA9CA8DA3FF7A14FB20C5E86\nRelated_To (S) Screenshot 1: Program Connection Log\n(5d29d)\n\n\n(F) 5D29DFE2EA9CA8DA3FF7A14FB20C5E86\nConnected_From [(I) 153.68.198.14](http:153.68.198.14)\n(5d29d)\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nThis file contains three embedded resources. Two of the resources are 32bit and 64bit versions of the winpcap packet driver called npf.sys.\nThe third resource is the program's configuration file, netplg.log.\n\nWhen the program is executed, it will look for any previous existence of itself by looking for the mutex '\\Global\\NetplugDiscovery0.7'.\n\nThe malware will then install the packet driver described above based on the operating system architecture.\n\nIf this is the first time the program has started, the program will create and install a new service called 'netplug\".\n\n---Begin Service Details--­\n\nnetplug\nNetwork Card Service\n\"This service monitors the network interface, turning it off or on depending on signal, used mainly for laptos that may not always be\nconnected.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the netplug service is executed, it will load 'netplg.log'. This resource will then be stored in %System32% and contains the hard-coded\n[IP address, 153.68.198.14. This IP address is used to calculate the true command and control (C2) IP address by XORing the IP address](http:153.68.198.14)\nwith the hex string 0x579C3A53 and attempting to connect to the newly created IP address on TCP Port 443. The malware generates a log\nfile in the current directory where activity regarding the installation of the bot and the connection are stored. This file is named the same as\nthe malware with the <malware_name>.log. If the malware is able to connect, it will send the log file to the C2. In this analysis, the C2 was\n[determined to be 202.126.90.89. See Screenshot 1. If no results are returned, the malware will terminate.](http:202.126.90.89)\n\nThe malware contains an attack component that can perform the following commands:\n\n---Begin Bot Commands--\nDownExec - Downloads and executes files (calls URLDownloadToFile)\nChngBotconfig - Changes the configuration of the bot\nBotUpdate - Updates the attack modules\nBotDie - Terminates the bot by calling a self-deleting batch file, msvcrt.bat\n\n[No Name] - Starts a new attack\n\n[No Name] - Stops the attack\n\n---End Bot Commands--­\n\nThe malware is capable of conducting three different types of attacks:\n\n---Begin Attack List--­\n\nNTP_ATTACK - Network Time Protocol attack via UDP flood\nCGN_ATTACK - Carrier Grade NAT attack targeting CGN IP addresses\nDNS_ATTACK - Domain Name Service attack via UDP flood\n\n---End Attack List--­\n\nWhen the Network Card Service (netplug) is started, the malware will begin logging activity to the file, <malware_name>.log which is stored\nin the current directory. The log file records all installation and connection activity associated with the bot and is written in plaintext. The\nfollowing is a sample of log file entries associated with the service startup:\n\n---Log File Entries--\nAtkNum:\nTotalPackets:\n\nResovle DnsName Falied: --> Written if unable to resolve DNS name from configuration file\n__ResolveDnsName: --> Written if resolution is successful\n\n:Connecting...<target>:<port> --> Written during connection process\n:Connected<target><port> --> Written if connection is successful\n:HS Success<name><port> --> If unsuccessful the socket will be closed\n:Connection Failed<target><port> --> Written if connection fails\n\nMyMain Started --> Service is initiated\nCreateService Success --> Service is successfully created\nStartService Success --> Service is successfully started\nCreateBotMutex: ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS --> Mutex is successfully created\nLoadConfig Failed: ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS --> The service is already running\nSERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN, error code = --> The service failed to start\nSetServiceStatus failed, error code = --> The service is not configured correctly\n**************Connection Fins... --> Written when the log is successfully sent to the C2\n\n---End File Entries--­\n\nEach time the service is started, it will attempt to open and read data from the configuration file:\n\n---Log File Entries--\nExtractPackage Failed: %d --> Written if the service fails to open the file\nExtractConfig Failed: %d --> Written if the service fails to read the file\nExtractPackage Success --> Written if the service successfully opens the file\nExtractConfig Success --> Written if the service successfully reads the file\n\n\n-----\n\n---End File Entries--\nWhen the service receives an attack command, the program creates a new log file called edbchk.log. This file is stored in C:\\Windows\n\\System32\\catroot2\\ and records all activity associated with the attack bot only. The following entries can be written to the log:\n\n---Begin File Entries--\n############## Received Attack Cmd %d#... --> Written when the attack command is received\nWaiting For NTP Attack <target> ...Remain <time> --> Written when the NTP attack is staged\nWaiting For NTP Fake Attack <target>...Remain <time> --> Written when the NTP fake attack is staged\n############## NTP Attack Started <target> --> Written when the NTP Attack starts\n############## NTP Fake Attack Started <target> --> Written when the NTP Attack starts\nReamin Time: --> Written at intervals during the attack\n############## NTP Attack Ended <target> --> Written when the attack ends\n############## NTP AttackTime is up --> Written if the attack fails\n\n############## CGN Attack Started <name> --> Written when the CGN attack starts\nWaiting for CGN Attack <target>...Remain <time> --> Written when the CGN attack is staged\n############## CGN Attack Ended <target>### --> Written when the CGN attack ends\n############## CGN AttackTime is up --> Written if the CGN attack fails\n\nWaiting for DNS Attack <target>...Remain<time> --> Written when the DNS Attack is staged\n############## DNS Attack Started <target> --> Written when the DNS Attack starts\n############## DNS Attack Ended <target> ### --> Written when the DNS Attack ends\nDNS AttackTime is up <time> --> Written if the DNS Attack fails\n\n############## Received Stop Cmd <target> --> Written when the attack bot is stopped\n\n---End File Entries--\nIf the bot is terminated (BotDie) the program will generate a self-deleting script called msvcrt.bat to delete itself.

When executed from the command line\nwith the -i argument, the program will install itself and launch a service named 'DnsQuerySvc'. During runtime, the program will bind and\nlisten for data on TCP Port 443. An operator can connect to the compromised system and send command and control data to the victim\nsystem. The data passed is encoded using a simple XOR cipher to make it difficult to identify as C2 traffic. Of particular note, the malware\ndoes not connect to the C2 server, but instead requires the operator to connect. Therefore, no network traffic would be detected until the\noperator decides to connect to push new payloads or commands to the victim system.\n\nAnalysis of this application reveals it provides operator decision based command and control capabilities over a victim system. It accepts\nblocks of data from an operator decodes them and then uses eight bytes of this decoded data to determine which activity to perform on\n\n\n-----\n\np y p y\n\n---Begin Commands--­\n\n0x26B9A0BA - Starts a C2 session.\n0x1AB0918C - This command allows the operator to replace the configuration file mimefilter.xml. The command also replaces the file\nextensions of the files edbres00001.jrs, edbres00002.jrs, edbres 00003.jrs and edbres00004.jrs with the following four respective file names\n-- .jrdb1, .jrbd2, .jrbd3 and .jrbd4. The purpose of replacing these files names and the purpose of the edbres * files are unknown as these files\nwere not included within this submission.\n0x1AB0918F - This command allows an operator to replace the file mimefilter.xml that the malware expects to be installed as\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\mimefilter.xml. This file is an RC4 configuration file that contains the working update directories the malware uses.\n0x1AB0918D - This command allows an operator to simultaneously exfiltrate four files at once from the victim system. The nature of\nthese four files is not known. Importantly, exfiltrated data will also be protected via the same XOR cipher as data received by the implant.\n0x1AB09190 - This command allows an operator to write a payload to the victim system's temp folder. The file name for this uploaded\npayload will start with 'oem'. The malware then reads this payload and processes it through an algorithm that appears to be a loader function.\nNone of these payloads were included within this submission, but analysis indicates they will be Win32 DLLs.\n0x1AB09191 - This command removes the extensions from any files which have an extension named .jrbt1, .jrbt2, .jrbt3, or .jrbt4. The\ncommand then uploads four files to the victim system that may have these extensions. This technique is likely used to ensure there are no\nfile name conflicts between files uploaded to the victim system. It appears this command is designed to allow an operator to push out multiple\npayloads to their collection of compromised systems simultaneously.\n0x1AB0918E - This command allows an operator to write 4 files to the victim system simultaneously. This command is similar to the\ncommand 0x1AB09191 except that it does not remove the .jrbt extensions from existing files.\n0x1AB09192 - This command allows the operator to upload a file to the victim system using the Win32 API WriteFile.\n0x1AB09193 - This command provides the operator with information about the victim system. It gets this information using the Win32\nAPIs GetComputerNameW and GetVersionExA.\n\n---End Commands--­\n\nThe program is designed to mimic the Windows Update process, in that it uses the same folders in C:\\Windows\\System32\\catroot2\\ as its\nprimary working folders:\n\n---Begin Catroot Folders--­\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\catroot2\\{A750E6C3-38EE-17D5-85E5- 10D03DA378DE}\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\catroot2\\{12CD0A1D-4EA2-11D1-8608- 00C04FC295EF}\n\n---End Catroot Folders--­\n\nAdditional payloads are uploaded to these folders. The Windows OS also uses these folders to store updates.\n\nIt appears the malware uses this location to mask its payloads as legitimate Windows updates. The C2 structure of the malware enables an\noperator to easily replace this RC4 encrypted file to dynamically adjust the working directory of their implant. A listing of the folders is found in\nthe program's configuration file, mimefilter.xml. After loading the configuration file, the malware will attempt to search the folders for all files\nthat begin with the name 'oem'. The malware attempts to read each of these files it finds, and processes their data through a function, which\nappears to be a loader method.
