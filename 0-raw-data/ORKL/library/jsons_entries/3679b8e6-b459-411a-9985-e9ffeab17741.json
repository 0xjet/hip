The new price is 0.03,\" the Qlocker\nTor site would display during their bait-and-switch.\n\nEventually, the above site shut down, but another Qlocker Tor site appeared a day or so\nlater.\n\n[Today, in BleepingComputer tests and victim's reports in our Qlocker support topic, all of the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/749247/qlocker-qnap-nas-ransomware-encrypting-with-extension-7z-read-metxt/)\nQlocker Tor sites are no longer accessible, and victims no longer have a way to pay the\nransom.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Since the DarkSide ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline and the subsequent intensifying](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/largest-us-pipeline-shuts-down-operations-after-ransomware-attack/)\n[of pressure by US law enforcement, the DarkSide ransomware shut down, and REvil has](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-servers-reportedly-seized-operation-shuts-down/)\nbegun to restrict their targets.\n\nSince then, other ransomware operations' Tor sites have gone offline, including those for\nAko/Ranzy and Everest.\n\nIt is not clear if the shutdown of the Qlocker sites is related to fear of increased law\nenforcement activity.\n\n## Following the money\n\nInstead of demanding millions of dollars to recover files, the threat actors priced their ransom\ndemands at only $500, which led to many businesses paying the ransom to recover their\nfiles.\n\nAs the Qlocker ransomware operation used a fixed set of Bitcoin addresses that victims were\nrotated through, it has been possible to track how many bitcoins they received in ransom\npayments.\n\nOut of the twenty-two Qlocker Bitcoin addresses known by BleepingComputer, victims paid a\ntotal of 8.93258497 bitcoins in ransomware. Today that is worth $353,708, but before this\nweek's Bitcoin crash, those same bitcoins would be worth almost $450,000.\n\n**Bitcoin Address** **Total Bitcoin payments**\n\n[34vbPQLgGZwKG2FikitGU6QR7K25aB6Shh](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/34vbPQLgGZwKG2FikitGU6QR7K25aB6Shh) 0.73258748\n\n[37m57HiP5rPceopgEWF9sM58CkzaDFYtaU](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/37m57HiP5rPceopgEWF9sM58CkzaDFYtaU) 0.29021317\n\n[3Ekwztte7oWR1odC1eKeL2Va4cpBuGXPgU](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3Ekwztte7oWR1odC1eKeL2Va4cpBuGXPgU) 0.28990667\n\n[3EPBKN3bcax81U3MdKYUhMC1fzFEFGPC6E](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3EPBKN3bcax81U3MdKYUhMC1fzFEFGPC6E) 0.27850668\n\n[3EvCKQ38y8ePUwM4w49XWVtAK7KhYbmeMH](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3EvCKQ38y8ePUwM4w49XWVtAK7KhYbmeMH) 0.45781656\n\n[3FvLioiqF2TrQgZ9zRMdd7QUfc2hTjKZfL](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3FvLioiqF2TrQgZ9zRMdd7QUfc2hTjKZfL) 0.19945862\n\n[3FXVLv8TmcHNmnfwLfc5g7f2a32xp3XugW](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3FXVLv8TmcHNmnfwLfc5g7f2a32xp3XugW) 0.59099550\n\n[3G6fbWX6At9uRzKf6kwS6R6pn5EQ8UsxKY](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3G6fbWX6At9uRzKf6kwS6R6pn5EQ8UsxKY) 0.32033215\n\n[3GfAJxhUen3oqb4sDDnPmXyhs5mDboHbyG](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3GfAJxhUen3oqb4sDDnPmXyhs5mDboHbyG) 0.57134513\n\n[3JRdPjB8U3nfDqQHzTqw9yYra49Gsd8Rar](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3JRdPjB8U3nfDqQHzTqw9yYra49Gsd8Rar) 0.57093368\n\n[3KmK5z4CAvn3aL4Q8F2gWbhuPRy9ZmEurN](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3KmK5z4CAvn3aL4Q8F2gWbhuPRy9ZmEurN) 0.48956001\n\n\n-----\n\n[3Kywg92E877KUWmyaeeLNSXFc5bqBvFbAm](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3Kywg92E877KUWmyaeeLNSXFc5bqBvFbAm) 0.62479830\n\n[3LLzycFNFh7mDsqRhfknfGBa6TKq6HcfwS](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3LLzycFNFh7mDsqRhfknfGBa6TKq6HcfwS) 0.42901320\n\n[3Lp1NkJHYsmFRBfM3ggoWsS1PF5hXxrwrD](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3Lp1NkJHYsmFRBfM3ggoWsS1PF5hXxrwrD) 0.50386846\n\n[3PDfzkTnD1E7gB7peZ2prRyDxjQ1BhqcV1](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3PDfzkTnD1E7gB7peZ2prRyDxjQ1BhqcV1) 0.32164647\n\n[3PunvFGpVWLX7PNAoT3bMDbPQU2QQW4kxN](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3PunvFGpVWLX7PNAoT3bMDbPQU2QQW4kxN) 0.26000332\n\n[3Q8WmjQyFs1EKCdu415t2P9cxY7AbqorPd](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3Q8WmjQyFs1EKCdu415t2P9cxY7AbqorPd) 0.58281373\n\n[3EWRngsRDhCxMHtKxeK6k9kX3pyWZSA2YB](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3EWRngsRDhCxMHtKxeK6k9kX3pyWZSA2YB) 0.29090963\n\n[3Gwz3yVmrGr5AqmUrAS8H2QQaPz2v9Rhpx](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3Gwz3yVmrGr5AqmUrAS8H2QQaPz2v9Rhpx) 0.27875489\n\n[3JtUAz4aKUrjcBK47ocdv52tTJkriat1nx](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3JtUAz4aKUrjcBK47ocdv52tTJkriat1nx) 0.25999912\n\n[3NtgDQCu7xck4UEpyTf8HNSSvrMCnKZRjt](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3NtgDQCu7xck4UEpyTf8HNSSvrMCnKZRjt) 0.28975298\n\n[3DhE1iZ5Ui6HALVKuuYXW52ArZPVJjUgJA](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3DhE1iZ5Ui6HALVKuuYXW52ArZPVJjUgJA) 0.29936922\n\nIf we divide the number of Bitcoins earned by the ransom payment of .01 bitcoins, we come\nout to approximately 893 victims who have paid the ransom.\n\nThis amount of ransoms and victims might be larger if Qlocker used other bitcoin addresses.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[QNAP alerts NAS customers of new DeadBolt ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-alerts-nas-customers-of-new-deadbolt-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[QNAP warns of ransomware targeting Internet-exposed NAS devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-warns-of-ransomware-targeting-internet-exposed-nas-devices/)\n\n[Ransom payment is roughly 15% of the total cost of ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransom-payment-is-roughly-15-percent-of-the-total-cost-of-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
