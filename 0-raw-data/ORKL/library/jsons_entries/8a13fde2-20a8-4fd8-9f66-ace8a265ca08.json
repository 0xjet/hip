Read this blog and learn what is RaaS and how the threat actors operate\nthese attacks to help you understand why ransomware attribution is an industry problem, and\nthe preemptive measures you need to take to protect your organization.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWe, as an industry, are continuously tracking how ransomware groups attack, and who the\nnewest victims are. We do this by monitoring their leak sites, documenting the way they\nperform the attacks (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures – aka TTPs), and analyzing their\ntoolsets. However, we sometimes forget to look at how all these groups work behind the\nscenes, what kind of resources they use before and after an attack, from affiliate services to\n“client support” platforms.\n\n[During the recent Rootedcon conference in Spain, we delivered a talk about this subject, and](https://www.rootedcon.com/)\n[this blog post serves as a commentary of the insights presented about Ransomware as a](https://marketing.outpost24.com/hubfs/RaaS%20and%20Hive/2022-03-10_Rooted_Ransomware%20Groups%20behind%20the%20scenes_Blueliv_Deck.pdf)\nService (RaaS): how it really works; how the threat actors operate these attacks; and how\norganizations can analyze the attacks and take preemptive measures in the event of future\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also took a deep dive into the activities of a particularly nefarious RaaS group called Hive\n(sometimes known as The Hive Gang); the in depth report will be published shortly so watch\nthis space.\n\n### Targeted ransomware\n\n[As we mentioned in the history of ransomware blog post, the ransomware ecosystem has](https://outpost24.com/blog/a-history-of-ransomware)\nevolved enormously in the past years. Operating a banking botnet used to be the most\n[popular way to get rich in the cybercriminal world, until CryptoLocker was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker) taken down in\n2014 and [Slavik’s earnings were published. Cybercriminals realized ransomware was a](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/)\nprofitable business, and so the ransomware boom began.\n\nSince then, threat actors have been adapting their toolset, techniques, and underground\nservices offering to better support and launch targeted ransomware attacks. Advanced\nattackers methodically penetrate corporate networks and move laterally to study the\nsystem(s). The malware is then deployed in a calculated manner designed to cause the\nbiggest obstruction to business operations possible thereby maximising the chances of being\npaid.\n\nWith this in mind, the targets of ransomware operations have adjusted and are no longer\ndomestic users but big corporations who can pay substantially higher amounts in ransom.\n[This change started with a few ransomware families like BitPaymer back in 2017, but](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dridex-group-created-bitpaymer-friedex-ransomware/)\ntargeted ransomware is widespread today.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 1. Graphic showing the attack flow of a targeted ransomware attack\nAdvanced attackers would often use their own unique ransomware families. However, this\nlead to perpetrators being easily attributed as the source. In 2019, the FBI announced\nsanctions against Evil Corp, a Russia based group, after it was identified as the culprit of the\nextensive use of DRIDEX-based malware attacks.\n\nIn a bid to better cover their tracks and avoid further sanctions, the group tried a new\nstrategy: continuously using different malware families. This included BitPaymer,\n[WastedLocker,](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/) [Hades, Phoenix Locker, PayloadBIN and Macaw Locker malwares.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker/)\n\n[Mandiant recently uncovered multiple Lockbit intrusions, an RaaS offering, which they](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2165-shifts-to-evade-sanctions)\nconnected with Evil Corp. While this is uncharacteristic of the group, it highlights another\npotential shift in strategy for the group as an attempt to distance themselves further from the\nrisk of sanction.\n\nExcluding Evil Corp, the majority of threat actors performing targeted attacks today make use\nof Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) offerings to get their hands on the ransomware binary.\nRaaS is now by far the most popular business model, allowing cybercriminals to swiftly set\nup their attack operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Ransomware as a Service\n\nRansomware as a Service (RaaS) is a more specialized version of the old Malware as a\nService (MaaS) model, where a provider supplies a client with the malware binary, access to\nthe backend to manage the botnet, and, in some cases, other additional services. When\ntalking about RaaS the only difference is that the provided malware is exclusively a\nransomware family.\n\nThere are different actors involved in the RaaS model, as can be seen in the following\ngraphic:\n\nImage 2. Graphic showing the Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) model\n\n**Administrators**\n\n(Image 2 in orange)\n\nThe Administrators provide the affiliates with access to the malware, the infrastructure and\nsometimes even support in negotiations with the victims. Depending on the group, the\ninfrastructure might be different, but it might include a leak site where victim information can\nbe published, an affiliate portal where the affiliate will manage victims and generate malware\nbinaries, the victim portal where victims will access to communicate with the cybercriminals,\nand, sometimes, even some internal servers for internal communication (internal IM, for\ninstance).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Administrators will get a cut from the affiliates operations (80-20 is quite common), but\nthey will not attack directly any victims.\n\n**Sellers**\n\n(Image 2 in blue)\n\nIf the RaaS offering is private, negotiations will be handled through private messages in\nforums or IM chats, and only accessible to certain cybercriminals with a particular reputation.\nThe rest of RaaS offerings need to be advertised to potential “clients” and this is where the\nsellers and resellers are\n\nuseful. Those actors will be in charge of managing the sales side of the operation and\nobtaining new affiliates, and this will be achieved advertising the RaaS in underground\nforums.\n\nIn this context, it is important to highlight that ransomware conversations were banned from\npopular underground forums, like Exploit or XSS, in May 2021. This was mainly due to\npolitical/law enforcement pressure into ransomware operators and the fear of a shutdown of\nthe forums. Other reasons were more philosophical. For instance, the administrator of XSS\nargued that the RaaS model is hurting the innovation in the cybercriminal community and\nthat this was a good reason for the ban too.\n\nImage\n\n3. XSS administrator announcing the ban and giving explanations\nAs it is normal in the underground ecosystem, when a service or forum disappears a new\none appears the next day. This is what happened with the ban of ransomware conversations.\n[In July 2021 a new forum called RAMP appeared where ransomware offering](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/10/what-the-ramp-leadership-change-means-for-cybersecurity/)\nadvertisements were more than welcome.\n\n**Affiliates**\n\n(Image 2 in gold)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe affiliates are the real attackers in a targeted ransomware operation. They will manage to\n[get access to the targeted organization, by their own means or using Initial Access Brokers,](https://outpost24.com/blog/Use-of-initial-access-brokers-by-ransomware-groups)\nand deploy the ransomware provided by the RaaS. They need to have enough experience to\nmove laterally between systems, avoid detections, exfiltrate stolen information and deploy\nthe ransomware in several systems at the same time.\n\nDepending on the RaaS program, the affiliates will need to register their victims, including\ninformation about the victim and the operation, upload the stolen information to the leak site\nand communicate with the victims.\n\n**Initial Access Brokers**\n\n(Image 2 in black)\n\nInitial Access Brokers (IABs) are financially motivated threat actors that profit through the\nsale of remote access to corporate networks in underground forums, like Exploit, or XSS.\nThe types of access tools offered are mostly Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Virtual Private\nNetwork (VPN), web shells, and remote access software tools offered by companies such\nCitrix, Pulse Secure, Zoho, or\n\nVMware. However, threat actors are also selling information and tools to perform intrusions\n[into companies through SQL injections, remote code execution (RCE) exploits, and other](https://outpost24.com/blog/SQL-injections-cyberattacks)\nvulnerabilities.\n\nImage 4. Initial Access Broker offering access to a relevant Spanish company\n[Read more on how ransomware groups use IABs](https://outpost24.com/blog/Use-of-initial-access-brokers-by-ransomware-groups)\nAffiliates of RaaS offerings might use IABs services in order to facilitate and streamline the\ntargeted ransomware operations, so they just need to focus on the intrusion, as the initial\naccess and the malware were already given to them. IAB advertisements detail the industry\n\n\n-----\n\nsector, location and revenue of the targets so affiliates can easily choose among them.\n\n**Victims**\n\n(Image 2 in green)\n\nNo person or organization wants to be the target of any malware attack, but of course they\ndo not get a choice, they are a critical part of it. Without these victims, or “clients” as the\nransomware operators call them, this business model would not work. The RaaS model\nexists because victims pay: there is no other option for them if they want a chance of\nsurviving the attack. And for some companies, even if they pay, they are not guaranteed\naccess to their systems and data. Regardless if they get access back or not, they are still at\nsignificant risk of bankruptcy. It’s not just the cost of the ransom, consider additional\ndamages like the cost of downtime, business reputation and more.\n\n### RaaS and attribution problems\n\nThreat attribution is crucial. Digging into the exact who, what, where, when and how of the\nattack provides valuable insights to better prevent attacks in the future.\n\nAs we have laid out above, different actors have different parts to play in the RaaS model.\nThe nature of this business model, where actions are spread across different and separate\nactors, makes\n\nlife much more difficult for analysts and researchers who try to accurately put the pieces of\nthe attack together and tie it to a group. Of course, we can attribute Indicators of\nCompromise (IOCs) and TTPs to the RaaS offering itself, as most of us do, but we should\nprobably not call that accurate attribution.\n\nIn most of the cases, RaaS administrators will not attack victims directly, they will provide\naffiliates with the needed elements to perform the targeted attack. Meaning that the\nattribution should point to the affiliate and not to the RaaS provider.\n\nHowever, an affiliate might have used the help of an IAB to access the targeted organization.\nThis means that the IAB has probably scanned the organization looking for security\nweaknesses and maybe even exploiting a specific vulnerability. In this case, this\nscanning/exploiting activity should be attributed to the IAB, but not to the affiliate.\n\nLet’s break down this example flow of an attack:\n\nActor A breaches the company and sells access to Actor B, an affiliate of Lockbit\n\n\n-----\n\nActor B requests a new payload to deploy and infect the company with ransomware\nThe company contacts Lockbit about the infection\nLockbit provides support and oversees the transaction\n\nSome questions that will need answered:\n\nGiven the IoCs that were retrieves from the infection, which belong to whom?\nIs the IP shown in the firewall logs to be associated with Actor A or Actor B?\nDoes the payload belong to Lockbit or Actor B?\n\nIdeally, an analyst wants to be able to differentiate between all these behaviors and IOCs,\nand correctly assign them to the corresponding actor.\n\nAttribution of ransomware attacks is extremely tricky because we don’t have enough\ninformation to accurately trace all the elements of an attack, tending to connect all indicators\nand attacking behavior to the RaaS itself, causing probably even more confusion for future\nanalysis.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nKnowing your enemy is key to effectively organize your defenses. Targeted ransomware\noperations are here to stay and they will continue threatening businesses indiscriminately.\n\nUnderstanding how these groups operate behind the scenes, how the RaaS model works\nwith its different actors, and how they negotiate is information that every potential\nransomware target should be aware of. Threat intelligence services and insights are crucial\nto know more about the attackers that might target an organization in the future, helping to\nmitigate as much as possible the impact of an attack.\n\nThe RaaS model makes even harder the attribution of attacks, as IOCs and TTPs can be\nattributed to the wrong actors in the RaaS scheme. There is no vendor with 100% of visibility\ninto threats, and that’s why industry collaboration is extremely important to fill the gaps and\nwin together the fight against ransomware.\n\n\n-----",
